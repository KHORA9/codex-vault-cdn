McClure\r\n\r\nProfusely Illustrated\r\n\r\nTHE JOHN C. WINSTON COMPANY\r\n\r\nCHICAGO & PHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN, the Great Story Telling President, whose Emancipation\r\nProclamation freed more than four million slaves, was a keen politician,\r\nprofound statesman, shrewd diplomatist, a thorough judge of men and\r\npossessed of an intuitive knowledge of affairs. He was the first Chief\r\nExecutive to die at the hands of an assassin. Without school education\r\nhe rose to power by sheer merit and will-power. Born in a Kentucky\r\nlog cabin in 1809, his surroundings being squalid, his chances for\r\nadvancement were apparently hopeless. President Lincoln died April 15th,\r\n1865, having been shot by J. Wilkes Booth the night before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nDean Swift said that the man who makes two blades of grass grow where\r\none grew before serves well of his kind. Considering how much grass\r\nthere is in the world and comparatively how little fun, we think that a\r\nstill more deserving person is the man who makes many laughs grow where\r\nnone grew before.\r\n\r\nSometimes it happens that the biggest crop of laugh is produced by a man\r\nwho ranks among the greatest and wisest. Such a man was Abraham Lincoln\r\nwhose wholesome fun mixed with true philosophy made thousands laugh and\r\nthink at the same time. He was a firm believer in the saying, “Laugh and\r\nthe world laughs with you.”\r\n\r\nWhenever Abraham Lincoln wanted to make a strong point he usually began\r\nby saying, “Now, that reminds me of a story.” And when he had told a\r\nstory every one saw the point and was put into a good humor.\r\n\r\nThe ancients had Aesop and his fables. The moderns had Abraham Lincoln\r\nand his stories.\r\n\r\nAesop’s Fables have been printed in book form in almost every language\r\nand millions have read them with pleasure and profit. Lincoln’s stories\r\nwere scattered in the recollections of thousands of people in various\r\nparts of the country. The historians who wrote histories of Lincoln’s\r\nlife remembered only a few of them, but the most of Lincoln’s stories\r\nand the best of them remained unwritten. More than five years ago the\r\nauthor of this book conceived the idea of collecting all the yarns and\r\nstories, the droll sayings, and witty and humorous anecdotes of Abraham\r\nLincoln into one large book, and this volume is the result of that idea.\r\n\r\nBefore Lincoln was ever heard of as a lawyer or politician, he was\r\nfamous as a story teller. As a politician, he always had a story to fit\r\nthe other side; as a lawyer, he won many cases by telling the jury a\r\nstory which showed them the justice of his side better than any argument\r\ncould have done.\r\n\r\nWhile nearly all of Lincoln’s stories have a humorous side, they also\r\ncontain a moral, which every good story should have.\r\n\r\nThey contain lessons that could be taught so well in no other way. Every\r\none of them is a sermon. Lincoln, like the Man of Galilee, spoke to the\r\npeople in parables.\r\n\r\nNothing that can be written about Lincoln can show his character in such\r\na true light as the yarns and stories he was so fond of telling, and at\r\nwhich he would laugh as heartily as anyone.\r\n\r\nFor a man whose life was so full of great responsibilities, Lincoln had\r\nmany hours of laughter when the humorous, fun-loving side of his great\r\nnature asserted itself.\r\n\r\nEvery person to keep healthy ought to have one good hearty laugh every\r\nday. Lincoln did, and the author hopes that the stories at which he\r\nlaughed will continue to furnish laughter to all who appreciate good\r\nhumor, with a moral point and spiced with that true philosophy bred in\r\nthose who live close to nature and to the people around them.\r\n\r\nIn producing this new Lincoln book, the publishers have followed an\r\nentirely new and novel method of illustrating it. The old shop-worn\r\npictures that are to be seen in every “History of Lincoln,” and in\r\nevery other book written about him, such as “A Flatboat on the Sangamon\r\nRiver,” “State Capitol at Springfield,” “Old Log Cabin,” etc., have all\r\nbeen left out and in place of them the best special artists that could\r\nbe employed have supplied original drawings illustrating the “point” of\r\nLincoln’s stories.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations are not copies of other pictures, but are original\r\ndrawings made from the author’s original text expressly for this book.\r\n\r\nIn these high-class outline pictures the artists have caught the true\r\nspirit of Lincoln’s humor, and while showing the laughable side of\r\nmany incidents in his career, they are true to life in the scenes and\r\ncharacters they portray.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these new and original pictures, the book contains many\r\nrare and valuable photograph portraits, together with biographies, of\r\nthe famous men of Lincoln’s day, whose lives formed a part of his own\r\nlife history.\r\n\r\nNo Lincoln book heretofore published has ever been so profusely, so\r\nartistically and expensively illustrated.\r\n\r\nThe parables, yarns, stories, anecdotes and sayings of the “Immortal\r\nAbe” deserve a place beside Aesop’s Fables, Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress\r\nand all other books that have added to the happiness and wisdom of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s stories are like Lincoln himself. The more we know of them the\r\nbetter we like them.\r\n\r\nBY COLONEL ALEXANDER K. McCLURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Lincoln would have been great among the greatest of the land as a\r\nstatesman and politician if like Washington, Jefferson and Jackson,\r\nhe had never told a humorous story, his sense of humor was the most\r\nfascinating feature of his personal qualities.\r\n\r\nHe was the most exquisite humorist I have ever known in my life. His\r\nhumor was always spontaneous, and that gave it a zest and elegance that\r\nthe professional humorist never attains.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the men who have become conspicuous in the country as\r\nhumorists have excelled in nothing else. S. S. Cox, Proctor Knott, John\r\nP. Hale and others were humorists in Congress. When they arose to speak\r\nif they failed to be humorous they utterly failed, and they rarely\r\nstrove to be anything but humorous. Such men often fail, for the\r\nprofessional humorist, however gifted, cannot always be at his best, and\r\nwhen not at his best he is grievously disappointing.\r\n\r\nI remember Corwin, of Ohio, who was a great statesman as well as a great\r\nhumorist, but whose humor predominated in his public speeches in Senate\r\nand House, warning a number of the younger Senators and Representatives\r\non a social occasion when he had returned to Congress in his old age,\r\nagainst seeking to acquire the reputation of humorists. He said it\r\nwas the mistake of his life. He loved it as did his hearers, but the\r\ntemptation to be humorous was always uppermost, and while his speech on\r\nthe Mexican War was the greatest ever delivered in the Senate, excepting\r\nWebster’s reply to Hayne, he regretted that he was more known as a\r\nhumorist than as a statesman.\r\n\r\nHis first great achievement in the House was delivered in 1840 in reply\r\nto General Crary, of Michigan, who had attacked General Harrison’s\r\nmilitary career. Corwin’s reply in defense of Harrison is universally\r\naccepted as the most brilliant combination of humor and invective ever\r\ndelivered in that body. The venerable John Quincy Adams a day or two\r\nafter Corwin’s speech, referred to Crary as “the late General Crary,”\r\n and the justice of the remark from the “Old Man Eloquent” was accepted\r\nby all. Mr. Lincoln differed from the celebrated humorists of the\r\ncountry in the important fact that his humor was unstudied. He was\r\nnot in any sense a professional humorist, but I have never in all\r\nmy intercourse with public men, known one who was so apt in humorous\r\nillustration us Mr. Lincoln, and I have known him many times to silence\r\ncontroversy by a humorous story with pointed application to the issue.\r\n\r\nHis face was the saddest in repose that I have ever seen among\r\naccomplished and intellectual men, and his sympathies for the people,\r\nfor the untold thousands who were suffering bereavement from the war,\r\noften made him speak with his heart upon his sleeve, about the sorrows\r\nwhich shadowed the homes of the land and for which his heart was freely\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\nI have many times seen him discussing in the most serious and heartfelt\r\nmanner the sorrows and bereavements of the country, and when it would\r\nseem as though the tension was so strained that the brittle cord of life\r\nmust break, his face would suddenly brighten like the sun escaping from\r\nbehind the cloud to throw its effulgence upon the earth, and he would\r\ntell an appropriate story, and much as his stories were enjoyed by his\r\nhearers none enjoyed them more than Mr. Lincoln himself.\r\n\r\nI have often known him within the space of a few minutes to be\r\ntransformed from the saddest face I have ever looked upon to one of the\r\nbrightest and most mirthful. It was well known that he had his great\r\nfountain of humor as a safety valve; as an escape and entire relief from\r\nthe fearful exactions his endless duties put upon him. In the gravest\r\nconsultations of the cabinet where he was usually a listener rather\r\nthan a speaker, he would often end dispute by telling a story and none\r\nmisunderstood it; and often when he was pressed to give expression on\r\nparticular subjects, and his always abundant caution was baffled, he\r\nmany times ended the interview by a story that needed no elaboration.\r\n\r\nI recall an interview with Mr. Lincoln at the White House in the\r\nspring of 1865, just before Lee retreated from Petersburg. It was well\r\nunderstood that the military power of the Confederacy was broken, and\r\nthat the question of reconstruction would soon be upon us.\r\n\r\nColonel Forney and I had called upon the President simply to pay our\r\nrespects, and while pleasantly chatting with him General Benjamin F.\r\nButler entered. Forney was a great enthusiast, and had intense hatred of\r\nthe Southern leaders who had hindered his advancement when Buchanan\r\nwas elected President, and he was bubbling over with resentment against\r\nthem. He introduced the subject to the President of the treatment to\r\nbe awarded to the leaders of the rebellion when its powers should be\r\nconfessedly broken, and he was earnest in demanding that Davis and other\r\nconspicuous leaders of the Confederacy should be tried, condemned and\r\nexecuted as traitors.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler joined Colonel Forney in demanding that treason must\r\nbe made odious by the execution of those who had wantonly plunged the\r\ncountry into civil war. Lincoln heard them patiently, as he usually\r\nheard all, and none could tell, however carefully they scanned his\r\ncountenance what impression the appeal made upon him.\r\n\r\nI said to General Butler that, as a lawyer pre-eminent in his\r\nprofession, he must know that the leaders of a government that had\r\nbeleaguered our capital for four years, and was openly recognized as\r\na belligerent power not only by our government but by all the leading\r\ngovernments of the world, could not be held to answer to the law for the\r\ncrime of treason.\r\n\r\nButler was vehement in declaring that the rebellious leaders must be\r\ntried and executed. Lincoln listened to the discussion for half an hour\r\nor more and finally ended it by telling the story of a common drunkard\r\nout in Illinois who had been induced by his friends time and again to\r\njoin the temperance society, but had always broken away. He was finally\r\ngathered up again and given notice that if he violated his pledge once\r\nmore they would abandon him as an utterly hopeless vagrant. He made\r\nan earnest struggle to maintain his promise, and finally he called for\r\nlemonade and said to the man who was preparing it: “Couldn’t you put\r\njust a drop of the cratur in unbeknownst to me?”\r\n\r\nAfter telling the story Lincoln simply added: “If these men could\r\nget away from the country unbeknownst to us, it might save a world of\r\ntrouble.” All understood precisely what Lincoln meant, although he\r\nhad given expression in the most cautious manner possible and the\r\ncontroversy was ended.\r\n\r\nLincoln differed from professional humorists in the fact that he\r\nnever knew when he was going to be humorous. It bubbled up on the most\r\nunexpected occasions, and often unsettled the most carefully studied\r\narguments. I have many times been with him when he gave no sign of\r\nhumor, and those who saw him under such conditions would naturally\r\nsuppose that he was incapable of a humorous expression. At other times\r\nhe would effervesce with humor and always of the most exquisite and\r\nimpressive nature. His humor was never strained; his stories never\r\nstale, and even if old, the application he made of them gave them the\r\nfreshness of originality.\r\n\r\nI recall sitting beside him in the White House one day when a message\r\nwas brought to him telling of the capture of several brigadier-generals\r\nand a number of horses somewhere out in Virginia. He read the dispatch\r\nand then in an apparently soliloquizing mood, said: “Sorry for the\r\nhorses; I can make brigadier-generals.”\r\n\r\nThere are many who believe that Mr. Lincoln loved to tell obscene or\r\nprofane stories, but they do great injustice to one of the purest and\r\nbest men I have ever known. His humor must be judged by the environment\r\nthat aided in its creation.\r\n\r\nAs a prominent lawyer who traveled the circuit in Illinois, he was much\r\nin the company of his fellow lawyers, who spent their evenings in the\r\nrude taverns of what was then almost frontier life. The Western people\r\nthus thrown together with but limited sources of culture and enjoyment,\r\nlogically cultivated the story teller, and Lincoln proved to be the most\r\naccomplished in that line of all the members of the Illinois bar. They\r\nhad no private rooms for study, and the evenings were always spent in\r\nthe common barroom of the tavern, where Western wit, often vulgar or\r\nprofane, was freely indulged in, and the best of them at times told\r\nstories which were somewhat “broad;” but even while thus indulging\r\nin humor that would grate harshly upon severely refined hearers, they\r\ndespised the vulgarian; none despised vulgarity more than Lincoln.\r\n\r\nI have heard him tell at one time or another almost or quite all of the\r\nstories he told during his Presidential term, and there were very few of\r\nthem which might not have been repeated in a parlor and none descended\r\nto obscene, vulgar or profane expressions. I have never known a man of\r\npurer instincts than Abraham Lincoln, and his appreciation of all that\r\nwas beautiful and good was of the highest order.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Mr. Lincoln that he frequently sought relief from\r\nthe fearfully oppressive duties which bore so heavily upon him. He had\r\nimmediately about him a circle of men with whom he could be “at home” in\r\nthe White House any evening as he was with his old time friends on the\r\nIllinois circuit.\r\n\r\nDavid Davis was one upon whom he most relied as an adviser, and Leonard\r\nSwett was probably one of his closest friends, while Ward Lamon, whom\r\nhe made Marshal of the District of Columbia to have him by his side,\r\nwas one with whom he felt entirely “at home.” Davis was of a more\r\nsober order but loved Lincoln’s humor, although utterly incapable of a\r\nhumorous expression himself. Swett was ready with Lincoln to give and\r\ntake in storyland, as was Lamon, and either of them, and sometimes all\r\nof them, often dropped in upon Lincoln and gave him an hour’s diversion\r\nfrom his exacting cares. They knew that he needed it and they sought him\r\nfor the purpose of diverting him from what they feared was an excessive\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nHis devotion to Lamon was beautiful. I well remember at Harrisburg\r\non the night of February 22, 1861, when at a dinner given by Governor\r\nCurtin to Mr. Lincoln, then on his way to Washington, we decided,\r\nagainst the protest of Lincoln, that he must change his route to\r\nWashington and make the memorable midnight journey to the capital. It\r\nwas thought to be best that but one man should accompany him, and he\r\nwas asked to choose. There were present of his suite Colonel Sumner,\r\nafterwards one of the heroic generals of the war, Norman B. Judd, who\r\nwas chairman of the Republican State Committee of Illinois, Colonel\r\nLamon and others, and he promptly chose Colonel Lamon, who alone\r\naccompanied him on his journey from Harrisburg to Philadelphia and\r\nthence to Washington.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the room Governor Curtin asked Colonel Lamon whether he\r\nwas armed, and he answered by exhibiting a brace of fine pistols, a\r\nhuge bowie knife, a black jack, and a pair of brass knuckles. Curtin\r\nanswered: “You’ll do,” and they were started on their journey after all\r\nthe telegraph wires had been cut. We awaited through what seemed almost\r\nan endless night, until the east was purpled with the coming of another\r\nday, when Colonel Scott, who had managed the whole scheme, reunited\r\nthe wires and soon received from Colonel Lamon this dispatch: “Plums\r\ndelivered nuts safely,” which gave us the intensely gratifying\r\ninformation that Lincoln had arrived in Washington.\r\n\r\nOf all the Presidents of the United States, and indeed of all the great\r\nstatesmen who have made their indelible impress upon the policy of the\r\nRepublic, Abraham Lincoln stands out single and alone in his individual\r\nqualities. He had little experience in statesmanship when he was called\r\nto the Presidency. He had only a few years of service in the State\r\nLegislature of Illinois, and a single term in Congress ending twelve\r\nyears before he became President, but he had to grapple with the gravest\r\nproblems ever presented to the statesmanship of the nation for solution,\r\nand he met each and all of them in turn with the most consistent\r\nmastery, and settled them so successfully that all have stood\r\nunquestioned until the present time, and are certain to endure while the\r\nRepublic lives.\r\n\r\nIn this he surprised not only his own cabinet and the leaders of his\r\nparty who had little confidence in him when he first became President,\r\nbut equally surprised the country and the world.\r\n\r\nHe was patient, tireless and usually silent when great conflicts raged\r\nabout him to solve the appalling problems which were presented at\r\nvarious stages of the war for determination, and when he reached his\r\nconclusion he was inexorable. The wrangles of faction and the jostling\r\nof ambition were compelled to bow when Lincoln had determined upon his\r\nline of duty.\r\n\r\nHe was much more than a statesman; he was one of the most sagacious\r\npoliticians I have ever known, although he was entirely unschooled in\r\nthe machinery by which political results are achieved. His judgment of\r\nmen was next to unerring, and when results were to be attained he\r\nknew the men who should be assigned to the task, and he rarely made a\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nI remember one occasion when he summoned Colonel Forney and myself to\r\nconfer on some political problem, he opened the conversation by saying:\r\n“You know that I never was much of a conniver; I don’t know the methods\r\nof political management, and I can only trust to the wisdom of leaders\r\nto accomplish what is needed.”\r\n\r\nLincoln’s public acts are familiar to every schoolboy of the nation, but\r\nhis personal attributes, which are so strangely distinguished from the\r\nattributes of other great men, are now the most interesting study\r\nof young and old throughout our land, and I can conceive of no more\r\nacceptable presentation to the public than a compilation of anecdotes\r\nand incidents pertaining to the life of the greatest of all our\r\nPresidents.\r\n\r\nA.K. McClure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S NAME AROUSES AN AUDIENCE, BY DR. NEWMAN HALL, of London.\r\n\r\nWhen I have had to address a fagged and listless audience, I have found\r\nthat nothing was so certain to arouse them as to introduce the name of\r\nAbraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nREVERE WASHINGTON AND LOVE LINCOLN, REV. DR. THEODORE L. CUYLER.\r\n\r\nNo other name has such electric power on every true heart, from Maine\r\nto Mexico, as the name of Lincoln.

DEPEW, United States\r\nSenator from New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said to me once: “They say I tell a great many stories; I\r\nreckon I do, but I have found in the course of a long experience that\r\ncommon people, take them as they run, are more easily informed through\r\nthe medium of a broad illustration than in any other way, and as to what\r\nthe hypercritical few may think, I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nHUMOR A PASSPORT TO THE HEART BY GEO. S. BOUTWELL, Former Secretary of\r\nthe United States Treasury.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s wit and mirth will give him a passport to the thoughts and\r\nhearts of millions who would take no interest in the sterner and more\r\npractical parts of his character.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROLL, ORIGINAL AND APPROPRIATE. BY ELIHU B. WASHBURNE, Former United\r\nStates Minister to France.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s anecdotes were all so droll, so original, so appropriate\r\nand so illustrative of passing incidents, that one never wearied.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S HUMOR A SPARKLING SPRING, BY DAVID R. LOCKE (PETROLEUM V.\r\nNASBY), Lincoln’s Favorite Humorist.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s flow of humor was a sparkling spring, gushing out of a\r\nrock--the flashing water had a somber background which made it all the\r\nbrighter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIKE AESOP’S FABLES, BY HUGH McCULLOCH, Former Secretary of the United\r\nStates Treasury.\r\n\r\nMany of Mr. Lincoln’s stories were as apt and instructive as the best of\r\nAesop’s Fables.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULL OF FUN, BY GENERAL JAMES B. FRY, Former Adjutant-General United\r\nStates Army.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was a humorist so full of fun that he could not keep it all\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\nINEXHAUSTIBLE FUND OF STORIES, BY LAWRENCE WELDON, Judge United States\r\nCourt of Claims.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s resources as a story-teller were inexhaustible, and\r\nno condition could arise in a case beyond his capacity to furnish an\r\nillustration with an appropriate anecdote.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPION STORY-TELLER, BY BEN.

McClure, the editorial director of the Philadelphia\r\nTimes, which he founded in 1875, began his forceful career as a tanner’s\r\napprentice in the mountains of Pennsylvania threescore years ago. He\r\ntanned hides all day, and read exchanges nights in the neighboring\r\nweekly newspaper office. The learned tanner’s boy also became the aptest\r\nInner in the county, and the editor testified his admiration for young\r\nMcClure’s attainments by sending him to edit a new weekly paper which\r\nthe exigencies of politics called into being in an adjoining county.\r\n\r\nThe lad was over six feet high, had the thews of Ajax and the voice of\r\nBoanerges, and knew enough about shoe-leather not to be afraid of any\r\nman that stood in it. He made his paper a success, went into politics,\r\nand made that a success, studied law with William McLellan, and made\r\nthat a success, and actually went into the army--and made that a\r\nsuccess, by an interesting accident which brought him into close\r\npersonal relations with Abraham Lincoln, whom he had helped to nominate,\r\nserving as chairman of the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania\r\nthrough the campaign.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the government needed troops badly, and in each Pennsylvania\r\ncounty Republicans and Democrats were appointed to assist in the\r\nenrollment, under the State laws. McClure, working day and night at\r\nHarrisburg, saw conscripts coming in at the rate of a thousand a day,\r\nonly to fret in idleness against the army red-tape which held them there\r\ninstead of sending a regiment a day to the front, as McClure demanded\r\nshould be done. The military officer continued to dispatch two companies\r\na day--leaving the mass of the conscripts to be fed by the contractors.\r\n\r\nMcClure went to Washington and said to the President, “You must send a\r\nmustering officer to Harrisburg who will do as I say; I can’t stay there\r\nany longer under existing conditions.”\r\n\r\nLincoln sent into another room for Adjutant-General Thomas. “General,”\r\n said he, “what is the highest rank of military officer at Harrisburg?”\r\n “Captain, sir,” said Thomas. “Bring me a commission for an Assistant\r\nAdjutant-General of the United States Army,” said Lincoln.\r\n\r\nSo Adjutant-General McClure was mustered in, and after that a regiment\r\na day of boys in blue left Harrisburg for the front. Colonel McClure is\r\none of the group of great Celt-American editors, which included Medill,\r\nMcCullagh and McLean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” LINCOLN’S YARNS AND STORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN ASKED TO BE SHOT.\r\n\r\nLincoln was, naturally enough, much surprised one day, when a man of\r\nrather forbidding countenance drew a revolver and thrust the weapon\r\nalmost into his face. In such circumstances “Abe” at once concluded that\r\nany attempt at debate or argument was a waste of time and words.\r\n\r\n“What seems to be the matter?” inquired Lincoln with all the calmness\r\nand self-possession he could muster.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the stranger, who did not appear at all excited, “some\r\nyears ago I swore an oath that if I ever came across an uglier man than\r\nmyself I’d shoot him on the spot.”\r\n\r\nA feeling of relief evidently took possession of Lincoln at this\r\nrejoinder, as the expression upon his countenance lost all suggestion of\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n“Shoot me,” he said to the stranger; “for if I am an uglier man than you\r\nI don’t want to live.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME LOST DIDN’T COUNT.\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed, the veteran journalist and politician, once related how,\r\nwhen he was opposing the claims of Montgomery Blair, who aspired to a\r\nCabinet appointment, that Mr. Lincoln inquired of Mr. Weed whom he would\r\nrecommend, “Henry Winter Davis,” was the response.\r\n\r\n“David Davis, I see, has been posting you up on this question,” retorted\r\nLincoln. “He has Davis on the brain. I think Maryland must be a good\r\nState to move from.”\r\n\r\nThe President then told a story of a witness in court in a neighboring\r\ncounty, who, on being asked his age, replied, “Sixty.” Being satisfied\r\nhe was much older the question was repeated, and on receiving the same\r\nanswer the court admonished the witness, saying, “The court knows you to\r\nbe much older than sixty.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I understand now,” was the rejoinder, “you’re thinking of those ten\r\nyears I spent on the eastern share of Maryland; that was so much time\r\nlost, and didn’t count.”\r\n\r\nBlair was made Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO VICES, NO VIRTUES.\r\n\r\nLincoln always took great pleasure in relating this yarn:\r\n\r\nRiding at one time in a stage with an old Kentuckian who was returning\r\nfrom Missouri, Lincoln excited the old gentleman’s surprise by refusing\r\nto accept either of tobacco or French brandy.\r\n\r\nWhen they separated that afternoon--the Kentuckian to take another stage\r\nbound for Louisville--he shook hands warmly with Lincoln, and said,\r\ngood-humoredly:\r\n\r\n“See here, stranger, you’re a clever but strange companion. I may never\r\nsee you again, and I don’t want to offend you, but I want to say this:\r\nMy experience has taught me that a man who has no vices has d----d few\r\nvirtues. Good-day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S DUES.\r\n\r\nMiss Todd (afterwards Mrs. Lincoln) had a keen sense of the ridiculous,\r\nand wrote several articles in the Springfield (Ill.) “Journal”\r\n reflecting severely upon General James Shields (who won fame in the\r\nMexican and Civil Wars, and was United States Senator from three\r\nstates), then Auditor of State.\r\n\r\nLincoln assumed the authorship, and was challenged by Shields to meet\r\nhim on the “field of honor.” Meanwhile Miss Todd increased Shields’ ire\r\nby writing another letter to the paper, in which she said: “I hear the\r\nway of these fire-eaters is to give the challenged party the choice of\r\nweapons, which being the case, I’ll tell you in confidence that I never\r\nfight with anything but broom-sticks, or hot water, or a shovelful of\r\ncoals, the former of which, being somewhat like a shillalah, may not be\r\nobjectionable to him.”\r\n\r\nLincoln accepted the challenge, and selected broadswords as the weapons.\r\nJudge Herndon (Lincoln’s law partner) gives the closing of this affair\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“The laws of Illinois prohibited dueling, and Lincoln demanded that\r\nthe meeting should be outside the state. Shields undoubtedly knew that\r\nLincoln was opposed to fighting a duel--that his moral sense would\r\nrevolt at the thought, and that he would not be likely to break the\r\nlaw by fighting in the state. Possibly he thought Lincoln would make a\r\nhumble apology. Shields was brave, but foolish, and would not listen to\r\novertures for explanation. It was arranged that the meeting should be\r\nin Missouri, opposite Alton. They proceeded to the place selected, but\r\nfriends interfered, and there was no duel. There is little doubt that\r\nthe man who had swung a beetle and driven iron wedges into gnarled\r\nhickory logs could have cleft the skull of his antagonist, but he had\r\nno such intention. He repeatedly said to the friends of Shields that in\r\nwriting the first article he had no thought of anything personal. The\r\nAuditor’s vanity had been sorely wounded by the second letter, in regard\r\nto which Lincoln could not make any explanation except that he had had\r\nno hand in writing it. The affair set all Springfield to laughing at\r\nShields.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“DONE WITH THE BIBLE.”\r\n\r\nLincoln never told a better story than this:\r\n\r\nA country meeting-house, that was used once a month, was quite a\r\ndistance from any other house.\r\n\r\nThe preacher, an old-line Baptist, was dressed in coarse linen\r\npantaloons, and shirt of the same material. The pants, manufactured\r\nafter the old fashion, with baggy legs, and a flap in the front, were\r\nmade to attach to his frame without the aid of suspenders.\r\n\r\nA single button held his shirt in position, and that was at the collar.\r\nHe rose up in the pulpit, and with a loud voice announced his text thus:\r\n“I am the Christ whom I shall represent to-day.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time a little blue lizard ran up his roomy pantaloons. The\r\nold preacher, not wishing to interrupt the steady flow of his sermon,\r\nslapped away on his leg, expecting to arrest the intruder, but his\r\nefforts were unavailing, and the little fellow kept on ascending higher\r\nand higher.\r\n\r\nContinuing the sermon, the preacher loosened the central button which\r\ngraced the waistband of his pantaloons, and with a kick off came that\r\neasy-fitting garment.\r\n\r\nBut, meanwhile, Mr. Lizard had passed the equatorial line of the\r\nwaistband, and was calmly exploring that part of the preacher’s anatomy\r\nwhich lay underneath the back of his shirt.\r\n\r\nThings were now growing interesting, but the sermon was still grinding\r\non. The next movement on the preacher’s part was for the collar button,\r\nand with one sweep of his arm off came the tow linen shirt.\r\n\r\nThe congregation sat for an instant as if dazed; at length one old\r\nlady in the rear part of the room rose up, and, glancing at the excited\r\nobject in the pulpit, shouted at the top of her voice: “If you represent\r\nChrist, then I’m done with the Bible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE.\r\n\r\nOnce, when Lincoln was pleading a case, the opposing lawyer had all the\r\nadvantage of the law; the weather was warm, and his opponent, as was\r\nadmissible in frontier courts, pulled off his coat and vest as he grew\r\nwarm in the argument.\r\n\r\nAt that time, shirts with buttons behind were unusual. Lincoln took in\r\nthe situation at once. Knowing the prejudices of the primitive people\r\nagainst pretension of all sorts, or any affectation of superior social\r\nrank, arising, he said: “Gentlemen of the jury, having justice on my\r\nside, I don’t think you will be at all influenced by the gentleman’s\r\npretended knowledge of the law, when you see he does not even know which\r\nside of his shirt should be in front.” There was a general laugh, and\r\nLincoln’s case was won.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MISCHIEVOUS OX.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln once told the following story of Colonel W., who had\r\nbeen elected to the Legislature, and had also been judge of the County\r\nCourt. His elevation, however, had made him somewhat pompous, and he\r\nbecame very fond of using big words. On his farm he had a very large and\r\nmischievous ox, called “Big Brindle,” which very frequently broke down\r\nhis neighbors’ fences, and committed other depredations, much to the\r\nColonel’s annoyance.\r\n\r\nOne morning after breakfast, in the presence of Lincoln, who had stayed\r\nwith him over night, and who was on his way to town, he called his\r\noverseer and said to him:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Allen, I desire you to impound ‘Big Brindle,’ in order that I may\r\nhear no animadversions on his eternal depredations.”\r\n\r\nAllen bowed and walked off, sorely puzzled to know what the Colonel\r\nwanted him to do. After Colonel W. left for town, he went to his wife\r\nand asked her what the Colonel meant by telling him to impound the ox.\r\n\r\n“Why, he meant to tell you to put him in a pen,” said she.\r\n\r\nAllen left to perform the feat, for it was no inconsiderable one, as\r\nthe animal was wild and vicious, but, after a great deal of trouble and\r\nvexation, succeeded.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, wiping the perspiration from his brow and\r\nsoliloquizing, “this is impounding, is it? Now, I am dead sure that the\r\nColonel will ask me if I impounded ‘Big Brindle,’ and I’ll bet I puzzle\r\nhim as he did me.”\r\n\r\nThe next day the Colonel gave a dinner party, and as he was not\r\naristocratic, Allen, the overseer, sat down with the company. After the\r\nsecond or third glass was discussed, the Colonel turned to the overseer\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“Eh, Mr. Allen, did you impound ‘Big Brindle,’ sir?”\r\n\r\nAllen straightened himself, and looking around at the company, replied:\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did, sir; but ‘Old Brindle’ transcended the impanel of the\r\nimpound, and scatterlophisticated all over the equanimity of the\r\nforest.”\r\n\r\nThe company burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, while the\r\nColonel’s face reddened with discomfiture.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that, sir?” demanded the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“Why, I mean, Colonel,” replied Allen, “that ‘Old Brindle,’ being\r\nprognosticated with an idea of the cholera, ripped and teared, snorted\r\nand pawed dirt, jumped the fence, tuck to the woods, and would not be\r\nimpounded nohow.”\r\n\r\nThis was too much; the company roared again, the Colonel being forced\r\nto join in the laughter, and in the midst of the jollity Allen left the\r\ntable, saying to himself as he went, “I reckon the Colonel won’t ask me\r\nto impound any more oxen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL “CHIN-FLY.”\r\n\r\nSome of Mr. Lincoln’s intimate friends once called his attention to\r\na certain member of his Cabinet who was quietly working to secure a\r\nnomination for the Presidency, although knowing that Mr. Lincoln was to\r\nbe a candidate for re-election. His friends insisted that the Cabinet\r\nofficer ought to be made to give up his Presidential aspirations or be\r\nremoved from office. The situation reminded Mr. Lincoln of a story:\r\n\r\n“My brother and I,” he said, “were once plowing corn, I driving the\r\nhorse and he holding the plow. The horse was lazy, but on one occasion\r\nhe rushed across the field so that I, with my long legs, could scarcely\r\nkeep pace with him. On reaching the end of the furrow, I found an\r\nenormous chin-fly fastened upon him, and knocked him off. My brother\r\nasked me what I did that for. I told him I didn’t want the old horse\r\nbitten in that way. ‘Why,’ said my brother, ‘that’s all that made him\r\ngo.’ Now,” said Mr. Lincoln, “if Mr.---- has a Presidential chin-fly\r\nbiting him, I’m not going to knock him off, if it will only make his\r\ndepartment go.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘SQUIRE BAGLY’S PRECEDENT.\r\n\r\nMr. T. W. S. Kidd, of Springfield, says that he once heard a lawyer\r\nopposed to Lincoln trying to convince a jury that precedent was superior\r\nto law, and that custom made things legal in all cases. When Lincoln\r\narose to answer him he told the jury he would argue his case in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“Old ‘Squire Bagly, from Menard, came into my office and said, ‘Lincoln,\r\nI want your advice as a lawyer. Has a man what’s been elected justice of\r\nthe peace a right to issue a marriage license?’ I told him he had not;\r\nwhen the old ‘squire threw himself back in his chair very indignantly,\r\nand said, ‘Lincoln, I thought you was a lawyer. Now Bob Thomas and me\r\nhad a bet on this thing, and we agreed to let you decide; but if this is\r\nyour opinion I don’t want it, for I know a thunderin’ sight better, for\r\nI have been ‘squire now for eight years and have done it all the time.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE’D NEED HIS GUN.\r\n\r\nWhen the President, early in the War, was anxious about the defenses\r\nof Washington, he told a story illustrating his feelings in the case.\r\nGeneral Scott, then Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army, had\r\nbut 1,500 men, two guns and an old sloop of war, the latter anchored\r\nin the Potomac, with which to protect the National Capital, and the\r\nPresident was uneasy.\r\n\r\nTo one of his queries as to the safety of Washington, General Scott had\r\nreplied, “It has been ordained, Mr. President, that the city shall not\r\nbe captured by the Confederates.”\r\n\r\n“But we ought to have more men and guns here,” was the Chief Executive’s\r\nanswer. “The Confederates are not such fools as to let a good chance to\r\ncapture Washington go by, and even if it has been ordained that the city\r\nis safe, I’d feel easier if it were better protected. All this reminds\r\nme of the old trapper out in the West who had been assured by some ‘city\r\nfolks’ who had hired him as a guide that all matters regarding life and\r\ndeath were prearranged.\r\n\r\n“‘It is ordained,’ said one of the party to the old trapper, ‘that you\r\nare to die at a certain time, and no one can kill you before that time.\r\nIf you met a thousand Indians, and your death had not been ordained for\r\nthat day, you would certainly escape.’\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t exactly understand this “ordained” business,’ was the\r\ntrapper’s reply. ‘I don’t care to run no risks. I always have my gun\r\nwith me, so that if I come across some reds I can feel sure that I won’t\r\ncross the Jordan ‘thout taking some of ‘em with me. Now, for instance,\r\nif I met an Indian in the woods; he drew a bead on me--sayin’, too, that\r\nhe wasn’t more’n ten feet away--an’ I didn’t have nothing to protect\r\nmyself; say it was as bad as that, the redskin bein’ dead ready to kill\r\nme; now, even if it had been ordained that the Indian (sayin’ he was a\r\ngood shot), was to die that very minute, an’ I wasn’t, what would I do\r\n‘thout my gun?’\r\n\r\n“There you are,” the President remarked; “even if it has been ordained\r\nthat the city of Washington will never be taken by the Southerners, what\r\nwould we do in case they made an attack upon the place, without men and\r\nheavy guns?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEPT UP THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nJudge T. Lyle Dickey of Illinois related that when the excitement\r\nover the Kansas Nebraska bill first broke out, he was with Lincoln and\r\nseveral friends attending court. One evening several persons, including\r\nhimself and Lincoln, were discussing the slavery question. Judge\r\nDickey contended that slavery was an institution which the Constitution\r\nrecognized, and which could not be disturbed. Lincoln argued that\r\nultimately slavery must become extinct. “After awhile,” said Judge\r\nDickey, “we went upstairs to bed. There were two beds in our room, and\r\nI remember that Lincoln sat up in his night shirt on the edge of the\r\nbed arguing the point with me. At last we went to sleep. Early in\r\nthe morning I woke up and there was Lincoln half sitting up in bed.\r\n‘Dickey,’ said he, ‘I tell you this nation cannot exist half slave and\r\nhalf free.’ ‘Oh, Lincoln,’ said I, ‘go to sleep.”’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUINE INGRATITUDE.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, while eager that the United States troops should\r\nbe supplied with the most modern and serviceable weapons, often took\r\noccasion to put his foot down upon the mania for experimenting with\r\nwhich some of his generals were afflicted. While engaged in these\r\nexperiments much valuable time was wasted, the enemy was left to do as\r\nhe thought best, no battles were fought, and opportunities for winning\r\nvictories allowed to pass.\r\n\r\nThe President was an exceedingly practical man, and when an invention,\r\nidea or discovery was submitted to him, his first step was to ascertain\r\nhow any or all of them could be applied in a way to be of benefit to the\r\narmy. As to experimenting with “contrivances” which, to his mind, could\r\nnever be put to practical use, he had little patience.\r\n\r\n“Some of these generals,” said he, “experiment so long and so much with\r\nnewfangled, fancy notions that when they are finally brought to a\r\nhead they are useless. Either the time to use them has gone by, or the\r\nmachine, when put in operation, kills more than it cures.\r\n\r\n“One of these generals, who has a scheme for ‘condensing’ rations,\r\nis willing to swear his life away that his idea, when carried to\r\nperfection, will reduce the cost of feeding the Union troops to almost\r\nnothing, while the soldiers themselves will get so fat that they’ll\r\n‘bust out’ of their uniforms. Of course, uniforms cost nothing, and real\r\nfat men are more active and vigorous than lean, skinny ones, but that is\r\ngetting away from my story.\r\n\r\n“There was once an Irishman--a cabman--who had a notion that he could\r\ninduce his horse to live entirely on shavings. The latter he could get\r\nfor nothing, while corn and oats were pretty high-priced. So he daily\r\nlessened the amount of food to the horse, substituting shavings for the\r\ncorn and oats abstracted, so that the horse wouldn’t know his rations\r\nwere being cut down.\r\n\r\n“However, just as he had achieved success in his experiment, and the\r\nhorse had been taught to live without other food than shavings, the\r\nungrateful animal ‘up and died,’ and he had to buy another.\r\n\r\n“So far as this general referred to is concerned, I’m afraid\r\nthe soldiers will all be dead at the time when his experiment is\r\ndemonstrated as thoroughly successful.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘TWAS “MOVING DAY.”\r\n\r\nSpeed, who was a prosperous young merchant of Springfield, reports\r\nthat Lincoln’s personal effects consisted of a pair of saddle-bags,\r\ncontaining two or three lawbooks, and a few pieces of clothing. Riding\r\non a borrowed horse, he thus made his appearance in Springfield. When he\r\ndiscovered that a single bedstead would cost seventeen dollars he said,\r\n“It is probably cheap enough, but I have not enough money to pay for\r\nit.” When Speed offered to trust him, he said: “If I fail here as a\r\nlawyer, I will probably never pay you at all.” Then Speed offered to\r\nshare large double bed with him.\r\n\r\n“Where is your room?” Lincoln asked.\r\n\r\n“Upstairs,” said Speed, pointing from the store leading to his room.\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, he took his saddle-bags on his arm, went\r\nupstairs, set them down on the floor, came down again, and with a face\r\nbeaming with pleasure and smiles, exclaimed: “Well, Speed, I’m moved.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE’S” HAIR NEEDED COMBING.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” remarked President Lincoln one day to Colonel Cannon, a\r\nclose personal friend, “I can tell you a good story about my hair. When\r\nI was nominated at Chicago, an enterprising fellow thought that a great\r\nmany people would like to see how ‘Abe’ Lincoln looked, and, as I had\r\nnot long before sat for a photograph, the fellow, having seen it, rushed\r\nover and bought the negative.\r\n\r\n“He at once got no end of wood-cuts, and so active was their circulation\r\nthey were soon selling in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\n“Soon after they reached Springfield, I heard a boy crying them for sale\r\non the streets. ‘Here’s your likeness of “Abe” Lincoln!’ he shouted.\r\n‘Buy one; price only two shillings! Will look a great deal better when\r\nhe gets his hair combed!”’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOULD “TAKE TO THE WOODS.”\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Seward was bothered considerably regarding the\r\ncomplication into which Spain had involved the United States government\r\nin connection with San Domingo, and related his troubles to the\r\nPresident. Negotiations were not proceeding satisfactorily, and things\r\nwere mixed generally. We wished to conciliate Spain, while the negroes\r\nhad appealed against Spanish oppression.\r\n\r\nThe President did not, to all appearances, look at the matter seriously,\r\nbut, instead of treating the situation as a grave one, remarked that\r\nSeward’s dilemma reminded him of an interview between two negroes in\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nOne was a preacher, who, with the crude and strange notions of his\r\nignorant race, was endeavoring to admonish and enlighten his brother\r\nAfrican of the importance of religion and the danger of the future.\r\n\r\n“Dar are,” said Josh, the preacher, “two roads befo’ you, Joe; be\r\nca’ful which ob dese you take. Narrow am de way dat leads straight to\r\ndestruction; but broad am de way dat leads right to damnation.”\r\n\r\nJoe opened his eyes with affright, and under the spell of the awful\r\ndanger before him, exclaimed, “Josh, take which road you please; I shall\r\ngo troo de woods.”\r\n\r\n“I am not willing,” concluded the President, “to assume any new troubles\r\nor responsibilities at this time, and shall therefore avoid going to the\r\none place with Spain, or with the negro to the other, but shall ‘take to\r\nthe woods.’ We will maintain an honest and strict neutrality.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN CARRIED HER TRUNK.\r\n\r\n“My first strong impression of Mr. Lincoln,” says a lady of Springfield,\r\n“was made by one of his kind deeds. I was going with a little friend for\r\nmy first trip alone on the railroad cars. It was an epoch of my life.\r\nI had planned for it and dreamed of it for weeks. The day I was to go\r\ncame, but as the hour of the train approached, the hackman, through\r\nsome neglect, failed to call for my trunk. As the minutes went on,\r\nI realized, in a panic of grief, that I should miss the train. I was\r\nstanding by the gate, my hat and gloves on, sobbing as if my heart would\r\nbreak, when Mr. Lincoln came by.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, what’s the matter?’ he asked, and I poured out all my story.\r\n\r\n“‘How big’s the trunk? There’s still time, if it isn’t too big.’ And he\r\npushed through the gate and up to the door. My mother and I took him up\r\nto my room, where my little old-fashioned trunk stood, locked and tied.\r\n‘Oh, ho,’ he cried, ‘wipe your eyes and come on quick.’ And before I\r\nknew what he was going to do, he had shouldered the trunk, was down\r\nstairs, and striding out of the yard. Down the street he went fast as\r\nhis long legs could carry him, I trotting behind, drying my tears as I\r\nwent. We reached the station in time. Mr. Lincoln put me on the train,\r\nkissed me good-bye, and told me to have a good time. It was just like\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOAT HAD TO STOP.\r\n\r\nLincoln never failed to take part in all political campaigns in\r\nIllinois, as his reputation as a speaker caused his services to be in\r\ngreat demand. As was natural, he was often the target at which many of\r\nthe “Smart Alecks” of that period shot their feeble bolts, but Lincoln\r\nwas so ready with his answers that few of them cared to engage him a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nIn one campaign Lincoln was frequently annoyed by a young man who\r\nentertained the idea that he was a born orator. He had a loud voice, was\r\nfull of language, and so conceited that he could not understand why the\r\npeople did not recognize and appreciate his abilities.\r\n\r\nThis callow politician delighted in interrupting public speakers, and\r\nat last Lincoln determined to squelch him. One night while addressing a\r\nlarge meeting at Springfield, the fellow became so offensive that\r\n“Abe” dropped the threads of his speech and turned his attention to the\r\ntormentor.\r\n\r\n“I don’t object,” said Lincoln, “to being interrupted with sensible\r\nquestions, but I must say that my boisterous friend does not always make\r\ninquiries which properly come under that head. He says he is afflicted\r\nwith headaches, at which I don’t wonder, as it is a well-known fact that\r\nnature abhors a vacuum, and takes her own way of demonstrating it.\r\n\r\n“This noisy friend reminds me of a certain steamboat that used to run on\r\nthe Illinois river. It was an energetic boat, was always busy. When they\r\nbuilt it, however, they made one serious mistake, this error being in\r\nthe relative sizes of the boiler and the whistle. The latter was usually\r\nbusy, too, and people were aware that it was in existence.\r\n\r\n“This particular boiler to which I have reference was a six-foot one,\r\nand did all that was required of it in the way of pushing the boat\r\nalong; but as the builders of the vessel had made the whistle a six-foot\r\none, the consequence was that every time the whistle blew the boat had\r\nto stop.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMCCLELLAN’S “SPECIAL TALENT.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln one day remarked to a number of personal friends who\r\nhad called upon him at the White House:\r\n\r\n“General McClellan’s tardiness and unwillingness to fight the enemy or\r\nfollow up advantages gained, reminds me of a man back in Illinois who\r\nknew a few law phrases but whose lawyer lacked aggressiveness. The man\r\nfinally lost all patience and springing to his feet vociferated, ‘Why\r\ndon’t you go at him with a fi. fa., a demurrer, a capias, a surrebutter,\r\nor a ne exeat, or something; or a nundam pactum or a non est?’\r\n\r\n“I wish McClellan would go at the enemy with something--I don’t care\r\nwhat. General McClellan is a pleasant and scholarly gentleman. He is\r\nan admirable engineer, but he seems to have a special talent for a\r\nstationary engine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW “JAKE” GOT AWAY.\r\n\r\nOne of the last, if not the very last story told by President Lincoln,\r\nwas to one of his Cabinet who came to see him, to ask if it would be\r\nproper to permit “Jake” Thompson to slip through Maine in disguise and\r\nembark for Portland.\r\n\r\nThe President, as usual, was disposed to be merciful, and to permit\r\nthe arch-rebel to pass unmolested, but Secretary Stanton urged that he\r\nshould be arrested as a traitor.\r\n\r\n“By permitting him to escape the penalties of treason,” persisted the\r\nWar Secretary, “you sanction it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Mr. Lincoln, “let me tell you a story. There was an\r\nIrish soldier here last summer, who wanted something to drink stronger\r\nthan water, and stopped at a drug-shop, where he espied a soda-fountain.\r\n‘Mr. Doctor,’ said he, ‘give me, plase, a glass of soda-wather, an’\r\nif yez can put in a few drops of whiskey unbeknown to any one, I’ll be\r\nobleeged.’ Now,” continued Mr. Lincoln, “if ‘Jake’ Thompson is permitted\r\nto go through Maine unbeknown to any one, what’s the harm? So don’t have\r\nhim arrested.”\r\n\r\nMORE LIGHT AND LESS NOISE.\r\n\r\nThe President was bothered to death by those persons who boisterously\r\ndemanded that the War be pushed vigorously; also, those who shouted\r\ntheir advice and opinions into his weary ears, but who never suggested\r\nanything practical. These fellows were not in the army, nor did they\r\never take any interest, in a personal way, in military matters, except\r\nwhen engaged in dodging drafts.\r\n\r\n“That reminds me,” remarked Mr. Lincoln one day, “of a farmer who lost\r\nhis way on the Western frontier. Night came on, and the embarrassments\r\nof his position were increased by a furious tempest which suddenly burst\r\nupon him. To add to his discomfort, his horse had given out, leaving him\r\nexposed to all the dangers of the pitiless storm.\r\n\r\n“The peals of thunder were terrific, the frequent flashes of lightning\r\naffording the only guide on the road as he resolutely trudged onward,\r\nleading his jaded steed. The earth seemed fairly to tremble beneath him\r\nin the war of elements. One bolt threw him suddenly upon his knees.\r\n\r\n“Our traveler was not a prayerful man, but finding himself involuntarily\r\nbrought to an attitude of devotion, he addressed himself to the Throne\r\nof Grace in the following prayer for his deliverance:\r\n\r\n“‘O God! hear my prayer this time, for Thou knowest it is not often that\r\nI call upon Thee. And, O Lord! if it is all the same to Thee, give us a\r\nlittle more light and a little less noise.’\r\n\r\n“I wish,” the President said, sadly, “there was a stronger disposition\r\nmanifested on the part of our civilian warriors to unite in suppressing\r\nthe rebellion, and a little less noise as to how and by whom the chief\r\nexecutive office shall be administered.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE BULLET AND A HATFUL.\r\n\r\nLincoln made the best of everything, and if he couldn’t get what he\r\nwanted he took what he could get. In matters of policy, while President\r\nhe acted according to this rule. He would take perilous chances, even\r\nwhen the result was, to the minds of his friends, not worth the risk he\r\nhad run.\r\n\r\nOne day at a meeting of the Cabinet, it being at the time when it seemed\r\nas though war with England and France could not be avoided, Secretary\r\nof State Seward and Secretary of War Stanton warmly advocated that the\r\nUnited States maintain an attitude, the result of which would have been\r\na declaration of hostilities by the European Powers mentioned.\r\n\r\n“Why take any more chances than are absolutely necessary?” asked the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n“We must maintain our honor at any cost,” insisted Secretary Seward.\r\n\r\n“We would be branded as cowards before the entire world,” Secretary\r\nStanton said.\r\n\r\n“But why run the greater risk when we can take a smaller one?” queried\r\nthe President calmly. “The less risk we run the better for us. That\r\nreminds me of a story I heard a day or two ago, the hero of which was\r\non the firing line during a recent battle, where the bullets were flying\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n“Finally his courage gave way entirely, and throwing down his gun, he\r\nran for dear life.\r\n\r\n“As he was flying along at top speed he came across an officer who drew\r\nhis revolver and shouted, ‘Go back to your regiment at once or I will\r\nshoot you!’\r\n\r\n“‘Shoot and be hanged,’ the racer exclaimed. ‘What’s one bullet to a\r\nwhole hatful?’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S STORY TO PEACE COMMISSIONERS.\r\n\r\nAmong the reminiscences of Lincoln left by Editor Henry J. Raymond, is\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nAmong the stories told by Lincoln, which is freshest in my mind, one\r\nwhich he related to me shortly after its occurrence, belongs to the\r\nhistory of the famous interview on board the River Queen, at Hampton\r\nRoads, between himself and Secretary Seward and the rebel Peace\r\nCommissioners. It was reported at the time that the President told a\r\n“little story” on that occasion, and the inquiry went around among the\r\nnewspapers, “What was it?”\r\n\r\nThe New York Herald published what purported to be a version of it, but\r\nthe “point” was entirely lost, and it attracted no attention. Being in\r\nWashington a few days subsequent to the interview with the Commissioners\r\n(my previous sojourn there having terminated about the first of last\r\nAugust), I asked Mr. Lincoln one day if it was true that he told\r\nStephens, Hunter and Campbell a story.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” he replied, manifesting some surprise, “but has it\r\nleaked out? I was in hopes nothing would be said about it, lest some\r\nover-sensitive people should imagine there was a degree of levity in\r\nthe intercourse between us.” He then went on to relate the circumstances\r\nwhich called it out.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said he, “we had reached and were discussing the slavery\r\nquestion. Mr. Hunter said, substantially, that the slaves, always\r\naccustomed to an overseer, and to work upon compulsion, suddenly freed,\r\nas they would be if the South should consent to peace on the basis of\r\nthe ‘Emancipation Proclamation,’ would precipitate not only themselves,\r\nbut the entire Southern society, into irremediable ruin. No work would\r\nbe done, nothing would be cultivated, and both blacks and whites would\r\nstarve!”\r\n\r\nSaid the President: “I waited for Seward to answer that argument, but as\r\nhe was silent, I at length said: ‘Mr. Hunter, you ought to know a great\r\ndeal better about this argument than I, for you have always lived under\r\nthe slave system. I can only say, in reply to your statement of the\r\ncase, that it reminds me of a man out in Illinois, by the name of Case,\r\nwho undertook, a few years ago, to raise a very large herd of hogs.\r\nIt was a great trouble to feed them, and how to get around this was a\r\npuzzle to him. At length he hit on the plan of planting an immense field\r\nof potatoes, and, when they were sufficiently grown, he turned the whole\r\nherd into the field, and let them have full swing, thus saving not only\r\nthe labor of feeding the hogs, but also that of digging the potatoes.\r\nCharmed with his sagacity, he stood one day leaning against the fence,\r\ncounting his hogs, when a neighbor came along.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, well,’ said he, ‘Mr. Case, this is all very fine. Your hogs are\r\ndoing very well just now, but you know out here in Illinois the frost\r\ncomes early, and the ground freezes for a foot deep. Then what you going\r\nto do?’\r\n\r\n“This was a view of the matter which Mr. Case had not taken into\r\naccount. Butchering time for hogs was ‘way on in December or January! He\r\nscratched his head, and at length stammered: ‘Well, it may come pretty\r\nhard on their snouts, but I don’t see but that it will be “root, hog, or\r\ndie.”’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” GOT THE WORST OF IT.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln was a young lawyer in Illinois, he and a certain Judge once\r\ngot to bantering one another about trading horses; and it was agreed\r\nthat the next morning at nine o’clock they should make a trade, the\r\nhorses to be unseen up to that hour, and no backing out, under a\r\nforfeiture of $25. At the hour appointed, the Judge came up, leading the\r\nsorriest-looking specimen of a horse ever seen in those parts. In a few\r\nminutes Mr. Lincoln was seen approaching with a wooden saw-horse upon\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\nGreat were the shouts and laughter of the crowd, and both were greatly\r\nincreased when Lincoln, on surveying the Judge’s animal, set down his\r\nsaw-horse, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Well, Judge, this is the first time I ever got the worst of it in a\r\nhorse trade.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT DEPENDED UPON HIS CONDITION.\r\n\r\nThe President had made arrangements to visit New York, and was told that\r\nPresident Garrett, of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, would be glad to\r\nfurnish a special train.\r\n\r\n“I don’t doubt it a bit,” remarked the President, “for I know Mr.\r\nGarrett, and like him very well, and if I believed--which I don’t, by\r\nany means--all the things some people say about his ‘secesh’ principles,\r\nhe might say to you as was said by the Superintendent of a certain\r\nrailroad to a son of one my predecessors in office. Some two years after\r\nthe death of President Harrison, the son of his successor in this office\r\nwanted to take his father on an excursion somewhere or other, and went\r\nto the Superintendent’s office to order a special train.\r\n\r\n“This Superintendent was a Whig of the most uncompromising sort, who\r\nhated a Democrat more than all other things on the earth, and promptly\r\nrefused the young man’s request, his language being to the effect\r\nthat this particular railroad was not running special trains for the\r\naccommodation of Presidents of the United States just at that season.\r\n\r\n“The son of the President was much surprised and exceedingly annoyed.\r\n‘Why,’ he said, ‘you have run special Presidential trains, and I know\r\nit. Didn’t you furnish a special train for the funeral of President\r\nHarrison?’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly we did,’ calmly replied the Superintendent, with no\r\nrelaxation of his features, ‘and if you will only bring your father here\r\nin the same shape as General Harrison was, you shall have the best train\r\non the road.”’\r\n\r\nWhen the laughter had subsided, the President said: “I shall take\r\npleasure in accepting Mr. Garrett’s offer, as I have no doubts whatever\r\nas to his loyalty to the United States government or his respect for the\r\noccupant of the Presidential office.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“GOT DOWN TO THE RAISINS.”\r\n\r\nA. B. Chandler, chief of the telegraph office at the War Department,\r\noccupied three rooms, one of which was called “the President’s room,”\r\n so much of his time did Mr. Lincoln spend there. Here he would read\r\nover the telegrams received for the several heads of departments. Three\r\ncopies of all messages received were made--one for the President, one\r\nfor the War Department records and one for Secretary Stanton.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler told a story as to the manner in which the President read\r\nthe despatches:\r\n\r\n“President Lincoln’s copies were kept in what we called the ‘President’s\r\ndrawer’ of the ‘cipher desk.’ He would come in at any time of the night\r\nor day, and go at once to this drawer, and take out a file of telegrams,\r\nand begin at the top to read them. His position in running over these\r\ntelegrams was sometimes very curious.\r\n\r\n“He had a habit of sitting frequently on the edge of his chair, with his\r\nright knee dragged down to the floor. I remember a curious expression\r\nof his when he got to the bottom of the new telegrams and began on those\r\nthat he had read before. It was, ‘Well, I guess I have got down to the\r\nraisins.’\r\n\r\n“The first two or three times he said this he made no explanation, and I\r\ndid not ask one. But one day, after he had made the remark, he looked up\r\nunder his eyebrows at me with a funny twinkle in his eyes, and said: ‘I\r\nused to know a little girl out West who sometimes was inclined to eat\r\ntoo much. One day she ate a good many more raisins than she ought to,\r\nand followed them up with a quantity of other goodies. They made her\r\nvery sick. After a time the raisins began to come.\r\n\r\n“She gasped and looked at her mother and said: ‘Well, I will be better\r\nnow I guess, for I have got down to the raisins.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“HONEST ABE” SWALLOWS HIS ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n“‘Honest Abe’ Taking Them on the Half-Shell” was one of the cartoons\r\npublished in 1860 by one of the illustrated periodicals. As may be\r\nseen, it represents Lincoln in a “Political Oyster House,” preparing to\r\nswallow two of his Democratic opponents for the Presidency--Douglas\r\nand Breckinridge. He performed the feat at the November election.\r\nThe Democratic party was hopelessly split in 1860 The Northern wing\r\nnominated Stephen A. Douglas, of Illinois, as their candidate,\r\nthe Southern wing naming John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky; the\r\nConstitutional Unionists (the old American of Know-Nothing party) placed\r\nJohn Bell, of Tennessee, in the field, and against these was put Abraham\r\nLincoln, who received the support of the Abolitionists.\r\n\r\nLincoln made short work of his antagonists when the election came\r\naround. He received a large majority in the Electoral College, while\r\nnearly every Northern State voted majorities for him at the polls.\r\nDouglas had but twelve votes in the Electoral College, while Bell had\r\nthirty-nine. The votes of the Southern States, then preparing to secede,\r\nwere, for the most part, thrown for Breckinridge. The popular vote was:\r\nLincoln, 1,857,610; Douglas, 1,365,976; Breckinridge, 847,953; Bell,\r\n590,631; total vote, 4,662,170. In the Electoral College Lincoln\r\nreceived 180; Douglas, 12; Breckinridge, 72; Bell, 39; Lincoln’s\r\nmajority over all, 57.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVING HIS WIND.\r\n\r\nJudge H. W. Beckwith of Danville, Ill., said that soon after the Ottawa\r\ndebate between Lincoln and Douglas he passed the Chenery House, then\r\nthe principal hotel in Springfield. The lobby was crowded with partisan\r\nleaders from various sections of the state, and Mr. Lincoln, from his\r\ngreater height, was seen above the surging mass that clung about him\r\nlike a swarm of bees to their ruler. The day was warm, and at the first\r\nchance he broke away and came out for a little fresh air, wiping the\r\nsweat from his face.\r\n\r\n“As he passed the door he saw me,” said Judge Beckwith, “and, taking\r\nmy hand, inquired for the health and views of his ‘friends over in\r\nVermillion county.’ He was assured they were wide awake, and further\r\ntold that they looked forward to the debate between him and Senator\r\nDouglas with deep concern. From the shadow that went quickly over his\r\nface, the pained look that came to give way quickly to a blaze of eyes\r\nand quiver of lips, I felt that Mr. Lincoln had gone beneath my mere\r\nwords and caught my inner and current fears as to the result. And then,\r\nin a forgiving, jocular way peculiar to him, he said: ‘Sit down; I have\r\na moment to spare, and will tell you a story.’ Having been on his feet\r\nfor some time, he sat on the end of the stone step leading into the\r\nhotel door, while I stood closely fronting him.\r\n\r\n“‘You have,’ he continued, ‘seen two men about to fight?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, many times.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, one of them brags about what he means to do. He jumps high in\r\nthe air, cracking his heels together, smites his fists, and wastes his\r\nwreath trying to scare somebody. You see the other fellow, he says not\r\na word,’--here Mr. Lincoln’s voice and manner changed to great\r\nearnestness, and repeating--‘you see the other man says not a word. His\r\narms are at his sides, his fists are closely doubled up, his head is\r\ndrawn to the shoulder, and his teeth are set firm together. He is saving\r\nhis wind for the fight, and as sure as it comes off he will win it, or\r\ndie a-trying.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT FOR, ONCE, ANYHOW.\r\n\r\nWhere men bred in courts, accustomed to the world, or versed in\r\ndiplomacy, would use some subterfuge, or would make a polite speech,\r\nor give a shrug of the shoulders, as the means of getting out of an\r\nembarrassing position, Lincoln raised a laugh by some bold west-country\r\nanecdote, and moved off in the cloud of merriment produced by the joke.\r\nWhen Attorney-General Bates was remonstrating apparently against\r\nthe appointment of some indifferent lawyer to a place of judicial\r\nimportance, the President interposed with: “Come now, Bates, he’s not\r\nhalf as bad as you think. Besides that, I must tell you, he did me a\r\ngood turn long ago. When I took to the law, I was going to court one\r\nmorning, with some ten or twelve miles of bad road before me, and I had\r\nno horse.\r\n\r\n“The judge overtook me in his carriage.\r\n\r\n“‘Hallo, Lincoln! are you not going to the court-house? Come in and I\r\nwill give you a seat!’\r\n\r\n“Well, I got in, and the Judge went on reading his papers. Presently the\r\ncarriage struck a stump on one side of the road, then it hopped off to\r\nthe other. I looked out, and I saw the driver was jerking from side to\r\nside in his seat, so I says:\r\n\r\n“‘Judge, I think your coachman has been taking a little too much this\r\nmorning.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, I declare, Lincoln,’ said he, ‘I should not much wonder if\r\nyou were right, for he has nearly upset me half a dozen times since\r\nstarting.’\r\n\r\n“So, putting his head out of the window, he shouted, ‘Why, you infernal\r\nscoundrel, you are drunk!’\r\n\r\n“Upon which, pulling up his horses, and turning round with great\r\ngravity, the coachman said:\r\n\r\n“‘Begorra! that’s the first rightful decision that you have given for\r\nthe last twelvemonth.’”\r\n\r\nWhile the company were laughing, the President beat a quiet retreat from\r\nthe neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“PITY THE POOR ORPHAN.”\r\n\r\nAfter the War was well on, and several battles had been fought, a lady\r\nfrom Alexandria asked the President for an order to release a certain\r\nchurch which had been taken for a Federal hospital. The President said\r\nhe could do nothing, as the post surgeon at Alexandria was immovable,\r\nand then asked the lady why she did not donate money to build a\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n“We have been very much embarrassed by the war,” she replied, “and our\r\nestates are much hampered.”\r\n\r\n“You are not ruined?” asked the President.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, but we do not feel that we should give up anything we have\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\nThe President, after some reflection, then said: “There are more battles\r\nyet to be fought, and I think God would prefer that your church be\r\ndevoted to the care and alleviation of the sufferings of our poor\r\nfellows. So, madam, you will excuse me. I can do nothing for you.”\r\n\r\nAfterward, in speaking of this incident, President Lincoln said that the\r\nlady, as a representative of her class in Alexandria, reminded him of\r\nthe story of the young man who had an aged father and mother owning\r\nconsiderable property. The young man being an only son, and believing\r\nthat the old people had outlived their usefulness, assassinated them\r\nboth. He was accused, tried and convicted of the murder. When the judge\r\ncame to pass sentence upon him, and called upon him to give any reason\r\nhe might have why the sentence of death should not be passed upon\r\nhim, he with great promptness replied that he hoped the court would be\r\nlenient upon him because he was a poor orphan!\r\n\r\n“BAP.” McNABB’S BOOSTER.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Lincoln did not drink, never swore, was a stranger to\r\nsmoking and lived a moral life generally, but he did like horse-racing\r\nand chicken fighting. New Salem, Illinois, where Lincoln was “clerking,”\r\n was known the neighborhood around as a “fast” town, and the average\r\nyoung man made no very desperate resistance when tempted to join in the\r\ndrinking and gambling bouts.\r\n\r\n“Bap.” McNabb was famous for his ability in both the raising and the\r\npurchase of roosters of prime fighting quality, and when his birds\r\nfought the attendance was large. It was because of the “flunking” of\r\none of “Bap.’s” roosters that Lincoln was enabled to make a point when\r\ncriticising McClellan’s unreadiness and lack of energy.\r\n\r\nOne night there was a fight on the schedule, one of “Bap.” McNabb’s\r\nbirds being a contestant. “Bap.” brought a little red rooster, whose\r\nfighting qualities had been well advertised for days in advance, and\r\nmuch interest was manifested in the outcome. As the result of these\r\ncontests was generally a quarrel, in which each man, charging foul play,\r\nseized his victim, they chose Lincoln umpire, relying not only on his\r\nfairness but his ability to enforce his decisions. Judge Herndon, in his\r\n“Abraham Lincoln,” says of this notable event:\r\n\r\n“I cannot improve on the description furnished me in February, 1865, by\r\none who was present.\r\n\r\n“They formed a ring, and the time having arrived, Lincoln, with one hand\r\non each hip and in a squatting position, cried, ‘Ready.’ Into the ring\r\nthey toss their fowls, ‘Bap.’s’ red rooster along with the rest. But\r\nno sooner had the little beauty discovered what was to be done than he\r\ndropped his tail and ran.\r\n\r\n“The crowd cheered, while ‘Bap.,’ in disappointment, picked him up and\r\nstarted away, losing his quarter (entrance fee) and carrying home his\r\ndishonored fowl. Once arrived at the latter place he threw his pet down\r\nwith a feeling of indignation and chagrin.\r\n\r\n“The little fellow, out of sight of all rivals, mounted a woodpile and\r\nproudly flirting out his feathers, crowed with all his might. ‘Bap.’\r\nlooked on in disgust.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, you little cuss,’ he exclaimed, irreverently, ‘you’re great on\r\ndress parade, but not worth a darn in a fight.”’\r\n\r\nIt is said, according to Judge Herndon, that Lincoln considered\r\nMcClellan as “great on dress parade,” but not so much in a fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LOW-DOWN TRICK.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln was a candidate of the Know Nothings for the State\r\nLegislature, the party was over-confident, and the Democrats pursued a\r\nstill-hunt. Lincoln was defeated. He compared the situation to one of\r\nthe camp-followers of General Taylor’s army, who had secured a barrel of\r\ncider, erected a tent, and commenced selling it to the thirsty soldiers\r\nat twenty-five cents a drink, but he had sold but little before another\r\nsharp one set up a tent at his back, and tapped the barrel so as to\r\nflow on his side, and peddled out No. 1 cider at five cents a drink, of\r\ncourse, getting the latter’s entire trade on the borrowed capital.\r\n\r\n“The Democrats,” said Mr. Lincoln, “had played Knownothing on a cheaper\r\nscale than had the real devotees of Sam, and had raked down his pile\r\nwith his own cider!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND FOR END.\r\n\r\nJudge H. W. Beckwith, of Danville, Ill., in his “Personal Recollections\r\nof Lincoln,” tells a story which is a good example of Lincoln’s way of\r\ncondensing the law and the facts of an issue in a story: “A man, by vile\r\nwords, first provoked and then made a bodily attack upon another. The\r\nlatter, in defending himself, gave the other much the worst of the\r\nencounter. The aggressor, to get even, had the one who thrashed him\r\ntried in our Circuit Court on a charge of an assault and battery. Mr.\r\nLincoln defended, and told the jury that his client was in the fix of\r\na man who, in going along the highway with a pitchfork on his shoulder,\r\nwas attacked by a fierce dog that ran out at him from a farmer’s\r\ndooryard. In parrying off the brute with the fork, its prongs stuck into\r\nthe brute and killed him.\r\n\r\n“‘What made you kill my dog?’ said the farmer.\r\n\r\n“‘What made him try to bite me?’\r\n\r\n“‘But why did you not go at him with the other end of the pitchfork?’\r\n\r\n“‘Why did he not come after me with his other end?’\r\n\r\n“At this Mr. Lincoln whirled about in his long arms an imaginary dog,\r\nand pushed its tail end toward the jury. This was the defensive plea of\r\n‘son assault demesne’--loosely, that ‘the other fellow brought on the\r\nfight,’--quickly told, and in a way the dullest mind would grasp and\r\nretain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET SIX SKUNKS GO.\r\n\r\nThe President had decided to select a new War Minister, and the Leading\r\nRepublican Senators thought the occasion was opportune to change the\r\nwhole seven Cabinet ministers. They, therefore, earnestly advised him to\r\nmake a clean sweep, and select seven new men, and so restore the waning\r\nconfidence of the country.\r\n\r\nThe President listened with patient courtesy, and when the Senators had\r\nconcluded, he said, with a characteristic gleam of humor in his eye:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, your request for a change of the whole Cabinet because I\r\nhave made one change reminds me of a story I once heard in Illinois,\r\nof a farmer who was much troubled by skunks. His wife insisted on his\r\ntrying to get rid of them.\r\n\r\n“He loaded his shotgun one moonlight night and awaited developments.\r\nAfter some time the wife heard the shotgun go off, and in a few minutes\r\nthe farmer entered the house.\r\n\r\n“‘What luck have you?’ asked she.\r\n\r\n“‘I hid myself behind the wood-pile,’ said the old man, ‘with the\r\nshotgun pointed towards the hen roost, and before long there appeared\r\nnot one skunk, but seven. I took aim, blazed away, killed one, and he\r\nraised such a fearful smell that I concluded it was best to let the\r\nother six go.”’\r\n\r\nThe Senators laughed and retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HE GOT BLACKSTONE.\r\n\r\nThe following story was told by Mr. Lincoln to Mr. A. J. Conant, the\r\nartist, who painted his portrait in Springfield in 1860:\r\n\r\n“One day a man who was migrating to the West drove up in front of my\r\nstore with a wagon which contained his family and household plunder. He\r\nasked me if I would buy an old barrel for which he had no room in his\r\nwagon, and which he said contained nothing of special value. I did not\r\nwant it, but to oblige him I bought it, and paid him, I think, half a\r\ndollar for it. Without further examination, I put it away in the store\r\nand forgot all about it. Some time after, in overhauling things, I\r\ncame upon the barrel, and, emptying it upon the floor to see what it\r\ncontained, I found at the bottom of the rubbish a complete edition of\r\nBlackstone’s Commentaries. I began to read those famous works, and I had\r\nplenty of time; for during the long summer days, when the farmers were\r\nbusy with their crops, my customers were few and far between. The more\r\nI read”--this he said with unusual emphasis--“the more intensely\r\ninterested I became. Never in my whole life was my mind so thoroughly\r\nabsorbed. I read until I devoured them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JOB FOR THE NEW CABINETMAKER.\r\n\r\nThis cartoon, labeled “A Job for the New Cabinetmaker,” was printed in\r\n“Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper” on February 2d, 1861, a month and\r\ntwo days before Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated President of the United\r\nStates. The Southern states had seceded from the Union, the Confederacy\r\nwas established, with Jefferson Davis as its President, the Union had\r\nbeen split in two, and the task Lincoln had before him was to glue the\r\ntwo parts of the Republic together. In his famous speech, delivered a\r\nshort time before his nomination for the Presidency by the Republican\r\nNational Convention at Chicago, in 1860, Lincoln had said: “A house\r\ndivided against itself cannot stand; this nation cannot exist half slave\r\nand half free.” After his inauguration as President, Mr. Lincoln went\r\nto work to glue the two pieces together, and after four years of bloody\r\nwar, and at immense cost, the job was finished; the house of the Great\r\nAmerican Republic was no longer divided; the severed sections--the North\r\nand the South--were cemented tightly; the slaves were freed, peace was\r\nfirmly established, and the Union of states was glued together so well\r\nthat the nation is stronger now than ever before. Lincoln was just the\r\nman for that job, and the work he did will last for all time. “The New\r\nCabinetmaker” knew his business thoroughly, and finished his task of\r\nglueing in a workmanlike manner. At the very moment of its completion,\r\nfive days after the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appomattox, the Martyr\r\nPresident fell at the hands of the assassin, J. Wilkes Booth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I CAN STAND IT IF THEY CAN.”\r\n\r\nUnited States Senator Benjamin Wade, of Ohio, Henry Winter Davis,\r\nof Maryland, and Wendell Phillips were strongly opposed to President\r\nLincoln’s re-election, and Wade and Davis issued a manifesto. Phillips\r\nmade several warm speeches against Lincoln and his policy.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he had read the manifesto or any of Phillips’ speeches,\r\nthe President replied:\r\n\r\n“I have not seen them, nor do I care to see them. I have seen enough to\r\nsatisfy me that I am a failure, not only in the opinion of the people\r\nin rebellion, but of many distinguished politicians of my own party. But\r\ntime will show whether I am right or they are right, and I am content to\r\nabide its decision.\r\n\r\n“I have enough to look after without giving much of my time to the\r\nconsideration of the subject of who shall be my successor in office. The\r\nposition is not an easy one; and the occupant, whoever he may be, for\r\nthe next four years, will have little leisure to pluck a thorn or plant\r\na rose in his own pathway.”\r\n\r\nIt was urged that this opposition must be embarrassing to his\r\nAdministration, as well as damaging to the party. He replied: “Yes, that\r\nis true; but our friends, Wade, Davis, Phillips, and others are hard\r\nto please. I am not capable of doing so. I cannot please them without\r\nwantonly violating not only my oath, but the most vital principles upon\r\nwhich our government was founded.\r\n\r\n“As to those who, like Wade and the rest, see fit to depreciate my\r\npolicy and cavil at my official acts, I shall not complain of them. I\r\naccord them the utmost freedom of speech and liberty of the press, but\r\nshall not change the policy I have adopted in the full belief that I am\r\nright.\r\n\r\n“I feel on this subject as an old Illinois farmer once expressed himself\r\nwhile eating cheese. He was interrupted in the midst of his repast by\r\nthe entrance of his son, who exclaimed, ‘Hold on, dad! there’s skippers\r\nin that cheese you’re eating!’\r\n\r\n“‘Never mind, Tom,’ said he, as he kept on munching his cheese, ‘if they\r\ncan stand it I can.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN MISTAKEN FOR ONCE.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was compelled to acknowledge that he made at least one\r\nmistake in “sizing up” men. One day a very dignified man called at the\r\nWhite House, and Lincoln’s heart fell when his visitor approached. The\r\nlatter was portly, his face was full of apparent anxiety, and Lincoln\r\nwas willing to wager a year’s salary that he represented some Society\r\nfor the Easy and Speedy Repression of Rebellions.\r\n\r\nThe caller talked fluently, but at no time did he give advice or suggest\r\na way to put down the Confederacy. He was full of humor, told a clever\r\nstory or two, and was entirely self-possessed.\r\n\r\nAt length the President inquired, “You are a clergyman, are you not,\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“Not by a jug full,” returned the stranger heartily.\r\n\r\nGrasping him by the hand Lincoln shook it until the visitor squirmed.\r\n“You must lunch with us. I am glad to see you. I was afraid you were a\r\npreacher.”\r\n\r\n“I went to the Chicago Convention,” the caller said, “as a friend of Mr.\r\nSeward. I have watched you narrowly ever since your inauguration, and\r\nI called merely to pay my respects. What I want to say is this: I think\r\nyou are doing everything for the good of the country that is in\r\nthe power of man to do. You are on the right track. As one of your\r\nconstituents I now say to you, do in future as you d---- please, and I\r\nwill support you!”\r\n\r\nThis was spoken with tremendous effect.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Mr. Lincoln in great astonishment, “I took you to be a\r\npreacher. I thought you had come here to tell me how to take Richmond,”\r\n and he again grasped the hand of his strange visitor.\r\n\r\nAccurate and penetrating as Mr. Lincoln’s judgment was concerning men,\r\nfor once he had been wholly mistaken. The scene was comical in the\r\nextreme. The two men stood gazing at each other. A smile broke from the\r\nlips of the solemn wag and rippled over the wide expanse of his homely\r\nface like sunlight overspreading a continent, and Mr. Lincoln was\r\nconvulsed with laughter.\r\n\r\nHe stayed to lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGOT EVERYTHING HE KNEW.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, while entertaining a few friends, is said to have\r\nrelated the following anecdote of a man who knew too much:\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of President Jackson there was a singular\r\nyoung gentleman employed in the Public Postoffice in Washington.\r\n\r\nHis name was G.; he was from Tennessee, the son of a widow, a neighbor\r\nof the President, on which account the old hero had a kind feeling for\r\nhim, and always got him out of difficulties with some of the higher\r\nofficials, to whom his singular interference was distasteful.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, it is said of him that while employed in the General\r\nPostoffice, on one occasion he had to copy a letter to Major H., a\r\nhigh official, in answer to an application made by an old gentleman in\r\nVirginia or Pennsylvania, for the establishment of a new postoffice.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the letter said the application could not be granted, in\r\nconsequence of the applicant’s “proximity” to another office.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter came into G.’s hand to copy, being a great stickler for\r\nplainness, he altered “proximity” to “nearness to.”\r\n\r\nMajor H. observed it, and asked G. why he altered his letter.\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied G., “because I don’t think the man would understand what\r\nyou mean by proximity.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Major H., “try him; put in the ‘proximity’ again.”\r\n\r\nIn a few days a letter was received from the applicant, in which he very\r\nindignantly said that his father had fought for liberty in the second\r\nwar for independence, and he should like to have the name of the\r\nscoundrel who brought the charge of proximity or anything else wrong\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n“There,” said G., “did I not say so?”\r\n\r\nG. carried his improvements so far that Mr. Berry, the\r\nPostmaster-General, said to him: “I don’t want you any longer; you know\r\ntoo much.”\r\n\r\nPoor G. went out, but his old friend got him another place.\r\n\r\nThis time G.’s ideas underwent a change. He was one day very busy\r\nwriting, when a stranger called in and asked him where the Patent Office\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said G.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me where the Treasury Department is?” said the stranger.\r\n\r\n“No,” said G.\r\n\r\n“Nor the President’s house?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger finally asked him if he knew where the Capitol was.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied G.\r\n\r\n“Do you live in Washington, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said G.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! and don’t you know where the Patent Office, Treasury,\r\nPresident’s House and Capitol are?”\r\n\r\n“Stranger,” said G., “I was turned out of the postoffice for knowing too\r\nmuch. I don’t mean to offend in that way again.\r\n\r\n“I am paid for keeping this book.\r\n\r\n“I believe I know that much; but if you find me knowing anything more\r\nyou may take my head.”\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE LOVED A GOOD STORY.\r\n\r\nJudge Breese, of the Supreme bench, one of the most distinguished of\r\nAmerican jurists, and a man of great personal dignity, was about to open\r\ncourt at Springfield, when Lincoln called out in his hearty way: “Hold\r\non, Breese! Don’t open court yet! Here’s Bob Blackwell just going to\r\ntell a story!” The judge passed on without replying, evidently regarding\r\nit as beneath the dignity of the Supreme Court to delay proceedings for\r\nthe sake of a story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEELS RAN AWAY WITH THEM.\r\n\r\nIn an argument against the opposite political party at one time during a\r\ncampaign, Lincoln said: “My opponent uses a figurative expression to\r\nthe effect that ‘the Democrats are vulnerable in the heel, but they are\r\nsound in the heart and head.’ The first branch of the figure--that\r\nis the Democrats are vulnerable in the heel--I admit is not merely\r\nfiguratively but literally true. Who that looks but for a moment at\r\ntheir hundreds of officials scampering away with the public money to\r\nTexas, to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may\r\nhope to find refuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most\r\ndistressingly affected in their heels with a species of running itch?\r\n\r\n“It seems that this malady of their heels operates on the sound-headed\r\nand honest-hearted creatures very much as the cork leg in the comic song\r\ndid on its owner, which, when he once got started on it, the more he\r\ntried to stop it, the more it would run away.\r\n\r\n“At the hazard of wearing this point threadbare, I will relate\r\nan anecdote the situation calls to my mind, which seems to be too\r\nstrikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier, who was always\r\nboasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who invariably\r\nretreated without orders at the first charge of the engagement, being\r\nasked by his captain why he did so, replied, ‘Captain, I have as brave\r\na heart as Julius Caesar ever had, but somehow or other, whenever danger\r\napproaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it.’\r\n\r\n“So with the opposite party--they take the public money into their hands\r\nfor the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can\r\ndictate; but before they can possibly get it out again, their rascally,\r\nvulnerable heels will run away with them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED TO BURN HIM DOWN TO THE STUMP.\r\n\r\nPreston King once introduced A. J. Bleeker to the President, and the\r\nlatter, being an applicant for office, was about to hand Mr. Lincoln his\r\nvouchers, when he was asked to read them. Bleeker had not read very far\r\nwhen the President disconcerted him by the exclamation, “Stop a minute!\r\nYou remind me exactly of the man who killed the dog; in fact, you are\r\njust like him.”\r\n\r\n“In what respect?” asked Bleeker, not feeling he had received a\r\ncompliment.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the President, “this man had made up his mind to kill\r\nhis dog, an ugly brute, and proceeded to knock out his brains with a\r\nclub. He continued striking the dog after the latter was dead until a\r\nfriend protested, exclaiming, ‘You needn’t strike him any more; the dog\r\nis dead; you killed him at the first blow.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, ‘I know that; but I believe in punishment after\r\ndeath.’ So, I see, you do.”\r\n\r\nBleeker acknowledged it was possible to overdo a good thing, and\r\nthen came back at the President with an anecdote of a good priest who\r\nconverted an Indian from heathenism to Christianity; the only difficulty\r\nhe had with him was to get him to pray for his enemies. “This Indian\r\nhad been taught to overcome and destroy all his friends he didn’t like,”\r\n said Bleeker, “but the priest told him that while that might be the\r\nIndian method, it was not the doctrine of Christianity or the Bible.\r\n‘Saint Paul distinctly says,’ the priest told him, ‘If thine enemy\r\nhunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink.’\r\n\r\n“The Indian shook his head at this, but when the priest added, ‘For\r\nin so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head,’ Poor Lo was\r\novercome with emotion, fell on his knees, and with outstretched hands\r\nand uplifted eyes invoked all sorts of blessings on the heads of all his\r\nenemies, supplicating for pleasant hunting-grounds, a large supply of\r\nsquaws, lots of papooses, and all other Indian comforts.\r\n\r\n“Finally the good priest interrupted him (as you did me, Mr. President),\r\nexclaiming, ‘Stop, my son! You have discharged your Christian duty, and\r\nhave done more than enough.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, no, father,’ replied the Indian; ‘let me pray! I want to burn him\r\ndown to the stump!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAD A “KICK” COMING.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, one of the Northern Governors, who was able, earnest\r\nand untiring in aiding the administration, but always complaining,\r\nsent dispatch after dispatch to the War Office, protesting against\r\nthe methods used in raising troops. After reading all his papers,\r\nthe President said, in a cheerful and reassuring tone to the\r\nAdjutant-General:\r\n\r\n“Never mind, never mind; those dispatches don’t mean anything. Just go\r\nright ahead. The Governor is like a boy I once saw at a launching. When\r\neverything was ready, they picked out a boy and sent him under the ship\r\nto knock away the trigger and let her go.\r\n\r\n“At the critical moment everything depended on the boy. He had to do the\r\njob well by a direct, vigorous blow, and then lie flat and keep still\r\nwhile the boat slid over him.\r\n\r\n“The boy did everything right, but he yelled as if he were being\r\nmurdered from the time he got under the keel until he got out. I thought\r\nthe hide was all scraped off his back, but he wasn’t hurt at all.\r\n\r\n“The master of the yard told me that this boy was always chosen for that\r\njob; that he did his work well; that he never had been hurt, but that he\r\nalways squealed in that way.\r\n\r\n“That’s just the way with Governor--. Make up your mind that he is not\r\nhurt, and that he is doing the work right, and pay no attention to his\r\nsquealing. He only wants to make you understand how hard his task is,\r\nand that he is on hand performing it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF BETSY ANN DOUGHERTY.\r\n\r\nMany requests and petitions made to Mr. Lincoln when he was President\r\nwere ludicrous and trifling, but he always entered into them with that\r\nhumor-loving spirit that was such a relief from the grave duties of his\r\ngreat office.\r\n\r\nOnce a party of Southerners called on him in behalf of one Betsy Ann\r\nDougherty. The spokesman, who was an ex-Governor, said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. President, Betsy Ann Dougherty is a good woman. She lived in my\r\ncounty and did my washing for a long time. Her husband went off and\r\njoined the rebel army, and I wish you would give her a protection\r\npaper.” The solemnity of this appeal struck Mr. Lincoln as uncommonly\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other--the Governor desperately earnest, and\r\nthe President masking his humor behind the gravest exterior. At last\r\nMr. Lincoln asked, with inimitable gravity, “Was Betsy Ann a good\r\nwasherwoman?” “Oh, yes, sir, she was, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Was your Betsy Ann an obliging woman?” “Yes, she was certainly very\r\nkind,” responded the Governor, soberly. “Could she do other things than\r\nwash?” continued Mr. Lincoln with the same portentous gravity.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; she was very kind--very.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Betsy Ann?”\r\n\r\n“She is now in New York, and wants to come back to Missouri, but she is\r\nafraid of banishment.”\r\n\r\n“Is anybody meddling with her?”\r\n\r\n“No; but she is afraid to come back unless you will give her a\r\nprotection paper.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr. Lincoln wrote on a visiting card the following:\r\n\r\n“Let Betsy Ann Dougherty alone as long as she behaves herself.\r\n\r\n“A. LINCOLN.”\r\n\r\nHe handed this card to her advocate, saying, “Give this to Betsy Ann.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. President, couldn’t you write a few words to the officers that\r\nwould insure her protection?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mr. Lincoln, “officers have no time now to read letters. Tell\r\nBetsy Ann to put a string in this card and hang it around her neck. When\r\nthe officers see this, they will keep their hands off your Betsy Ann.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAD TO WEAR A WOODEN SWORD.\r\n\r\nCaptain “Abe” Lincoln and his company (in the Black Hawk War) were\r\nwithout any sort of military knowledge, and both were forced to acquire\r\nsuch knowledge by attempts at drilling. Which was the more awkward, the\r\n“squad” or the commander, it would have been difficult to decide.\r\n\r\nIn one of Lincoln’s earliest military problems was involved the process\r\nof getting his company “endwise” through a gate. Finally he shouted,\r\n“This company is dismissed for two minutes, when it will fall in again\r\non the other side of the gate!”\r\n\r\nLincoln was one of the first of his company to be arraigned for\r\nunmilitary conduct. Contrary to the rules he fired a gun “within the\r\nlimits,” and had his sword taken from him. The next infringement of\r\nrules was by some of the men, who stole a quantity of liquor, drank it,\r\nand became unfit for duty, straggling out of the ranks the next day, and\r\nnot getting together again until late at night.\r\n\r\nFor allowing this lawlessness the captain was condemned to wear a wooden\r\nsword for two days. These were merely interesting but trivial incidents\r\nof the campaign. Lincoln was from the very first popular with his men,\r\nalthough one of them told him to “go to the devil.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” STIRRING THE “BLACK” COALS.\r\n\r\nUnder the caption, “The American Difficulty,” “Punch” printed on May\r\n11th, 1861, the cartoon reproduced here. The following text was placed\r\nbeneath the illustration: PRESIDENT ABE: “What a nice White House this\r\nwould be, if it were not for the blacks!” It was the idea in England,\r\nand, in fact, in all the countries on the European continent, that\r\nthe War of the Rebellion was fought to secure the freedom of the negro\r\nslaves. Such was not the case. The freedom of the slaves was one of\r\nthe necessary consequences of the Civil War, but not the cause of that\r\nbloody four years’ conflict. The War was the result of the secession of\r\nthe states of the South from the Union, and President “Abe’s” main aim\r\nwas to compel the seceding states to resume their places in the Federal\r\nUnion of states.\r\n\r\nThe blacks did not bother President “Abe” in the least as he knew he\r\nwould be enabled to give them their freedom when the proper time came.\r\nHe had the project of freeing them in his mind long before he issued his\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, the delay in promulgating that document\r\nbeing due to the fact that he did not wish to estrange the hundreds of\r\nthousands of patriots of the border states who were fighting for the\r\npreservation of the Union, and not for the freedom of the negro slaves.\r\nPresident “Abe” had patience, and everything came out all right in the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING RID OF AN ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\nCharles A. Dana, who was Assistant Secretary of War under Mr. Stanton,\r\nrelates the following: A certain Thompson had been giving the government\r\nconsiderable trouble. Dana received information that Thompson was about\r\nto escape to Liverpool.\r\n\r\nCalling upon Stanton, Dana was referred to Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n“The President was at the White House, business hours were over, Lincoln\r\nwas washing his hands. ‘Hallo, Dana,’ said he, as I opened the door,\r\n‘what is it now?’ ‘Well, sir,’ I said, ‘here is the Provost Marshal of\r\nPortland, who reports that Jacob Thompson is to be in town to-night,\r\nand inquires what orders we have to give.’ ‘What does Stanton say?’\r\nhe asked. ‘Arrest him,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ he continued, drawling his\r\nwords, ‘I rather guess not. When you have an elephant on your hands, and\r\nhe wants to run away, better let him run.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROTESQUE, YET FRIGHTFUL.\r\n\r\nThe nearest Lincoln ever came to a fight was when he was in the vicinity\r\nof the skirmish at Kellogg’s Grove, in the Black Hawk War. The rangers\r\narrived at the spot after the engagement and helped bury the five men\r\nwho were killed.\r\n\r\nLincoln told Noah Brooks, one of his biographers, that he “remembered\r\njust how those men looked as we rode up the little hill where their camp\r\nwas. The red light of the morning sun was streaming upon them as they\r\nlay, heads toward us, on the ground. And every man had a round, red spot\r\non the top of his head about as big as a dollar, where the redskins had\r\ntaken his scalp. It was frightful, but it was grotesque; and the red\r\nsunlight seemed to paint everything all over.”\r\n\r\nLincoln paused, as if recalling the vivid picture, and added, somewhat\r\nirrelevantly, “I remember that one man had on buckskin breeches.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” WAS NO DUDE.\r\n\r\nAlways indifferent in matters of dress, Lincoln cut but small figure in\r\nsocial circles, even in the earliest days of Illinois. His trousers were\r\ntoo short, his hat too small, and, as a rule, the buttons on the back of\r\nhis coat were nearer his shoulder blades than his waist.\r\n\r\nNo man was richer than his fellows, and there was no aristocracy;\r\nthe women wore linsey-woolsey of home manufacture, and dyed them in\r\naccordance with the tastes of the wearers; calico was rarely seen, and a\r\nwoman wearing a dress of that material was the envy of her sisters.\r\n\r\nThere being no shoemakers the women wore moccasins, and the men made\r\ntheir own boots. A hunting shirt, leggins made of skins, buckskin\r\nbreeches, dyed green, constituted an apparel no maiden could withstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTIC OF LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nOne man who knew Lincoln at New Salem, says the first time he saw him he\r\nwas lying on a trundle-bed covered with books and papers and rocking a\r\ncradle with his foot.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene was entirely characteristic--Lincoln reading and\r\nstudying, and at the same time helping his landlady by quieting her\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who knew Mr. Lincoln well in early manhood says: “Lincoln at\r\nthis period had nothing but plenty of friends.”\r\n\r\nAfter the customary hand-shaking on one occasion in the White House at\r\nWashington several gentlemen came forward and asked the President for\r\nhis autograph. One of them gave his name as “Cruikshank.” “That reminds\r\nme,” said Mr. Lincoln, “of what I used to be called when a young\r\nman--‘Long-shanks!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“PLOUGH ALL ‘ROUND HIM.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Blank went to the War Department one day in a towering rage:\r\n\r\n“I suppose you found it necessary to make large concessions to him, as\r\nhe returned from you perfectly satisfied,” suggested a friend.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” the President replied, “I did not concede anything. You have\r\nheard how that Illinois farmer got rid of a big log that was too big to\r\nhaul out, too knotty to split, and too wet and soggy to burn.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, now,’ said he, in response to the inquiries of his neighbors\r\none Sunday, as to how he got rid of it, ‘well, now, boys, if you won’t\r\ndivulge the secret, I’ll tell you how I got rid of it--I ploughed around\r\nit.’\r\n\r\n“Now,” remarked Lincoln, in conclusion, “don’t tell anybody, but that’s\r\nthe way I got rid of Governor Blank. I ploughed all round him, but it\r\ntook me three mortal hours to do it, and I was afraid every minute he’d\r\nsee what I was at.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’VE LOST MY APPLE.”\r\n\r\nDuring a public “reception,” a farmer from one of the border counties\r\nof Virginia told the President that the Union soldiers, in passing his\r\nfarm, had helped themselves not only to hay, but his horse, and he\r\nhoped the President would urge the proper officer to consider his claim\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said that this reminded him of an old acquaintance of his,\r\n“Jack” Chase, a lumberman on the Illinois, a steady, sober man, and the\r\nbest raftsman on the river. It was quite a trick to take the logs over\r\nthe rapids; but he was skilful with a raft, and always kept her straight\r\nin the channel. Finally a steamer was put on, and “Jack” was made\r\ncaptain of her. He always used to take the wheel, going through the\r\nrapids. One day when the boat was plunging and wallowing along the\r\nboiling current, and “Jack’s” utmost vigilance was being exercised to\r\nkeep her in the narrow channel, a boy pulled his coat-tail and hailed\r\nhim with:\r\n\r\n“Say, Mister Captain! I wish you would just stop your boat a\r\nminute--I’ve lost my apple overboard!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOST HIS CERTIFICATE OF CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln prepared his first inaugural address in a room over a\r\nstore in Springfield. His only reference works were Henry Clay’s\r\ngreat compromise speech of 1850, Andrew Jackson’s Proclamation against\r\nNullification, Webster’s great reply to Hayne, and a copy of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln started for Washington, to be inaugurated, the inaugural\r\naddress was placed in a special satchel and guarded with special care.\r\nAt Harrisburg the satchel was given in charge of Robert T. Lincoln, who\r\naccompanied his father. Before the train started from Harrisburg the\r\nprecious satchel was missing. Robert thought he had given it to a waiter\r\nat the hotel, but a long search failed to reveal the missing satchel\r\nwith its precious document. Lincoln was annoyed, angry, and finally in\r\ndespair. He felt certain that the address was lost beyond recovery, and,\r\nas it only lacked ten days until the inauguration, he had no time to\r\nprepare another. He had not even preserved the notes from which the\r\noriginal copy had been written.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln went to Ward Lamon, his former law partner, then one of his\r\nbodyguards, and informed him of the loss in the following words:\r\n\r\n“Lamon, I guess I have lost my certificate of moral character, written\r\nby myself. Bob has lost my gripsack containing my inaugural address.” Of\r\ncourse, the misfortune reminded him of a story.\r\n\r\n“I feel,” said Mr. Lincoln, “a good deal as the old member of the\r\nMethodist Church did when he lost his wife at the camp meeting, and\r\nwent up to an old elder of the church and asked him if he could tell him\r\nwhereabouts in h--l his wife was. In fact, I am in a worse fix than my\r\nMethodist friend, for if it were only a wife that were missing, mine\r\nwould be sure to bob up somewhere.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk at the hotel told Mr. Lincoln that he would probably find his\r\nmissing satchel in the baggage-room. Arriving there, Mr. Lincoln saw a\r\nsatchel which he thought was his, and it was passed out to him. His key\r\nfitted the lock, but alas! when it was opened the satchel contained\r\nonly a soiled shirt, some paper collars, a pack of cards and a bottle of\r\nwhisky. A few minutes later the satchel containing the inaugural address\r\nwas found among the pile of baggage.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of the address also reminded Mr. Lincoln of a story, which\r\nis thus narrated by Ward Lamon in his “Recollections of Abraham Lincoln”:\r\n\r\nThe loss of the address and the search for it was the subject of a great\r\ndeal of amusement. Mr. Lincoln said many funny things in connection with\r\nthe incident. One of them was that he knew a fellow once who had saved\r\nup fifteen hundred dollars, and had placed it in a private banking\r\nestablishment. The bank soon failed, and he afterward received ten per\r\ncent of his investment. He then took his one hundred and fifty dollars\r\nand deposited it in a savings bank, where he was sure it would be safe.\r\nIn a short time this bank also failed, and he received at the final\r\nsettlement ten per cent on the amount deposited. When the fifteen\r\ndollars was paid over to him, he held it in his hand and looked at it\r\nthoughtfully; then he said, “Now, darn you, I have got you reduced to a\r\nportable shape, so I’ll put you in my pocket.” Suiting the action to the\r\nword, Mr. Lincoln took his address from the bag and carefully placed\r\nit in the inside pocket of his vest, but held on to the satchel with\r\nas much interest as if it still contained his “certificate of moral\r\ncharacter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE PRESENTED FOR PAYMENT.\r\n\r\nThe great English funny paper, London “Punch,” printed this cartoon on\r\nSeptember 27th, 1862. It is intended to convey the idea that Lincoln,\r\nhaving asserted that the war would be over in ninety days, had not\r\nredeemed his word: The text under the Cartoon in Punch was:\r\n\r\nMR. SOUTH TO MR. NORTH: “Your ‘ninety-day’ promissory note isn’t taken\r\nup yet, sirree!”\r\n\r\nThe tone of the cartoon is decidedly unfriendly. The North finally took\r\nup the note, but the South had to pay it. “Punch” was not pleased\r\nwith the result, but “Mr. North” did not care particularly what this\r\nperiodical thought about it. The United States, since then, has been\r\nprepared to take up all of its obligations when due, but it must be\r\nacknowledged that at the time this cartoon was published the outlook was\r\nrather dark and gloomy. Lincoln did not despair, however; but although\r\nbusiness was in rather bad shape for a time, the financial skies finally\r\ncleared, business was resumed at the old stand, and Uncle Sam’s credit\r\nis now as good, or better, than other nations’ cash in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG WAS A “LEETLE BIT AHEAD.”\r\n\r\nLincoln could not sympathize with those Union generals who were prone to\r\nindulge in high-sounding promises, but whose performances did not by any\r\nmeans come up to their predictions as to what they would do if they ever\r\nmet the enemy face to face. He said one day, just after one of these\r\nbraggarts had been soundly thrashed by the Confederates:\r\n\r\n“These fellows remind me of the fellow who owned a dog which, so he\r\nsaid, just hungered and thirsted to combat and eat up wolves. It was a\r\ndifficult matter, so the owner declared, to keep that dog from devoting\r\nthe entire twenty-four hours of each day to the destruction of his\r\nenemies. He just ‘hankered’ to get at them.\r\n\r\n“One day a party of this dog-owner’s friends thought to have some sport.\r\nThese friends heartily disliked wolves, and were anxious to see the dog\r\neat up a few thousand. So they organized a hunting party and invited\r\nthe dog-owner and the dog to go with them. They desired to be personally\r\npresent when the wolf-killing was in progress.\r\n\r\n“It was noticed that the dog-owner was not over-enthusiastic in the\r\nmatter; he pleaded a ‘business engagement,’ but as he was the most\r\nnotorious and torpid of the town loafers, and wouldn’t have recognized a\r\n‘business engagement’ had he met it face to face, his excuse was treated\r\nwith contempt. Therefore he had to go.\r\n\r\n“The dog, however, was glad enough to go, and so the party started out.\r\nWolves were in plenty, and soon a pack was discovered, but when the\r\n‘wolf-hound’ saw the ferocious animals he lost heart, and, putting his\r\ntail between his legs, endeavored to slink away. At last--after many\r\ntrials--he was enticed into the small growth of underbrush where the\r\nwolves had secreted themselves, and yelps of terror betrayed the fact\r\nthat the battle was on.\r\n\r\n“Away flew the wolves, the dog among them, the hunting party following\r\non horseback. The wolves seemed frightened, and the dog was restored to\r\npublic favor. It really looked as if he had the savage creatures on the\r\nrun, as he was fighting heroically when last sighted.\r\n\r\n“Wolves and dog soon disappeared, and it was not until the party arrived\r\nat a distant farmhouse that news of the combatants was gleaned.\r\n\r\n“‘Have you seen anything of a wolf-dog and a pack of wolves around here?’\r\nwas the question anxiously put to the male occupant of the house, who\r\nstood idly leaning upon the gate.\r\n\r\n“‘Yep,’ was the short answer.\r\n\r\n“‘How were they going?’\r\n\r\n“‘Purty fast.’\r\n\r\n“‘What was their position when you saw them?’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ replied the farmer, in a most exasperatingly deliberate way,\r\n‘the dog was a leetle bit ahead.’\r\n\r\n“Now, gentlemen,” concluded the President, “that’s the position in which\r\nyou’ll find most of these bragging generals when they get into a fight\r\nwith the enemy. That’s why I don’t like military orators.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE’S” FIGHT WITH NEGROES.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln was nineteen years of age, he went to work for a Mr.\r\nGentry, and, in company with Gentry’s son, took a flatboat load of\r\nprovisions to New Orleans. At a plantation six miles below Baton Rouge,\r\nwhile the boat was tied up to the shore in the dead hours of the night,\r\nand Abe and Allen were fast asleep in the bed, they were startled by\r\nfootsteps on board. They knew instantly that it was a gang of negroes\r\ncome to rob and perhaps murder them. Allen, thinking to frighten the\r\nnegroes, called out, “Bring guns, Lincoln, and shoot them!” Abe came\r\nwithout the guns, but fell among the negroes with a huge bludgeon and\r\nbelabored them most cruelly, following them onto the bank. They rushed\r\nback to their boat and hastily put out into the stream. It is said that\r\nLincoln received a scar in this tussle which he carried with him to his\r\ngrave. It was on this trip that he saw the workings of slavery for the\r\nfirst time. The sight of New Orleans was like a wonderful panorama\r\nto his eyes, for never before had he seen wealth, beauty, fashion\r\nand culture. He returned home with new and larger ideas and stronger\r\nopinions of right and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOISE LIKE A TURNIP.\r\n\r\n“Every man has his own peculiar and particular way of getting at\r\nand doing things,” said President Lincoln one day, “and he is often\r\ncriticised because that way is not the one adopted by others. The great\r\nidea is to accomplish what you set out to do. When a man is successful\r\nin whatever he attempts, he has many imitators, and the methods used are\r\nnot so closely scrutinized, although no man who is of good intent will\r\nresort to mean, underhanded, scurvy tricks.\r\n\r\n“That reminds me of a fellow out in Illinois, who had better luck in\r\ngetting prairie chickens than any one in the neighborhood. He had a\r\nrusty old gun no other man dared to handle; he never seemed to exert\r\nhimself, being listless and indifferent when out after game, but he\r\nalways brought home all the chickens he could carry, while some of\r\nthe others, with their finely trained dogs and latest improved\r\nfowling-pieces, came home alone.\r\n\r\n“‘How is it, Jake?’ inquired one sportsman, who, although a good shot,\r\nand knew something about hunting, was often unfortunate, ‘that you never\r\ncome home without a lot of birds?’\r\n\r\n“Jake grinned, half closed his eyes, and replied: ‘Oh, I don’t know that\r\nthere’s anything queer about it. I jes’ go ahead an’ git ‘em.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, I know you do; but how do you do it?’\r\n\r\n“‘You’ll tell.’\r\n\r\n“‘Honest, Jake, I won’t say a word. Hope to drop dead this minute.’\r\n\r\n“‘Never say nothing, if I tell you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Cross my heart three times.’\r\n\r\n“This reassured Jake, who put his mouth close to the ear of his eager\r\nquestioner, and said, in a whisper:\r\n\r\n“‘All you got to do is jes’ to hide in a fence corner an’ make a noise\r\nlike a turnip. That’ll bring the chickens every time.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARDING OFF GOD’S VENGEANCE.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln was a candidate for re-election to the Illinois Legislature\r\nin 1836, a meeting was advertised to be held in the court-house in\r\nSpringfield, at which candidates of opposing parties were to speak. This\r\ngave men of spirit and capacity a fine opportunity to show the stuff of\r\nwhich they were made.\r\n\r\nGeorge Forquer was one of the most prominent citizens; he had been a\r\nWhig, but became a Democrat--possibly for the reason that by means of\r\nthe change he secured the position of Government land register, from\r\nPresident Andrew Jackson. He had the largest and finest house in\r\nthe city, and there was a new and striking appendage to it, called\r\na lightning-rod! The meeting was very large. Seven Whig and seven\r\nDemocratic candidates spoke.\r\n\r\nLincoln closed the discussion. A Kentuckian (Joshua F. Speed), who had\r\nheard Henry Clay and other distinguished Kentucky orators, stood near\r\nLincoln, and stated afterward that he “never heard a more effective\r\nspeaker;... the crowd seemed to be swayed by him as he pleased.” What\r\noccurred during the closing portion of this meeting must be given in\r\nfull, from Judge Arnold’s book:\r\n\r\n“Forquer, although not a candidate, asked to be heard for the Democrats,\r\nin reply to Lincoln. He was a good speaker, and well known throughout\r\nthe county. His special task that day was to attack and ridicule the\r\nyoung countryman from Salem.\r\n\r\n“Turning to Lincoln, who stood within a few feet of him, he said:\r\n‘This young man must be taken down, and I am truly sorry that the task\r\ndevolves upon me.’ He then proceeded, in a very overbearing way, and\r\nwith an assumption of great superiority, to attack Lincoln and his\r\nspeech. He was fluent and ready with the rough sarcasm of the stump, and\r\nhe went on to ridicule the person, dress and arguments of Lincoln\r\nwith so much success that Lincoln’s friends feared that he would be\r\nembarrassed and overthrown.”\r\n\r\n“The Clary’s Grove boys were present, and were restrained with difficulty\r\nfrom ‘getting up a fight’ in behalf of their favorite (Lincoln), they\r\nand all his friends feeling that the attack was ungenerous and unmanly.\r\n\r\n“Lincoln, however, stood calm, but his flashing eye and pale cheek\r\nindicated his indignation. As soon as Forquer had closed he took\r\nthe stand, and first answered his opponent’s arguments fully and\r\ntriumphantly. So impressive were his words and manner that a hearer\r\n(Joshua F. Speed) believes that he can remember to this day and repeat\r\nsome of the expressions.\r\n\r\n“Among other things he said: ‘The gentleman commenced his speech by\r\nsaying that “this young man,” alluding to me, “must be taken down.” I\r\nam not so young in years as I am in the tricks and the trades of a\r\npolitician, but,’ said he, pointing to Forquer, ‘live long or die young,\r\nI would rather die now than, like the gentleman, change my politics,\r\nand with the change receive an office worth $3,000 a year, and then,’\r\ncontinued he, ‘feel obliged to erect a lightning-rod over my house, to\r\nprotect a guilty conscience from an offended God!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFF DAVIS AND CHARLES THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis insisted on being recognized by his official title as\r\ncommander or President in the regular negotiation with the Government.\r\nThis Mr. Lincoln would not consent to.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter thereupon referred to the correspondence between King Charles\r\nthe First and his Parliament as a precedent for a negotiation between\r\na constitutional ruler and rebels. Mr. Lincoln’s face then wore that\r\nindescribable expression which generally preceded his hardest hits, and\r\nhe remarked: “Upon questions of history, I must refer you to Mr. Seward,\r\nfor he is posted in such things, and I don’t profess to be; but my only\r\ndistinct recollection of the matter is, that Charles lost his head.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVED SOLDIERS’ HUMOR.\r\n\r\nLincoln loved anything that savored of wit or humor among the soldiers.\r\nHe used to relate two stories to show, he said, that neither death nor\r\ndanger could quench the grim humor of the American soldier:\r\n\r\n“A soldier of the Army of the Potomac was being carried to the rear of\r\nbattle with both legs shot off, who, seeing a pie-woman, called out,\r\n‘Say, old lady, are them pies sewed or pegged?’\r\n\r\n“And there was another one of the soldiers at the battle of\r\nChancellorsville, whose regiment, waiting to be called into the fight,\r\nwas taking coffee. The hero of the story put to his lips a crockery\r\nmug which he had carried with care through several campaigns. A stray\r\nbullet, just missing the tinker’s head, dashed the mug into fragments\r\nand left only the handle on his finger. Turning his head in that\r\ndirection, he scowled, ‘Johnny, you can’t do that again!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD TIME FOR A BARBECUE.\r\n\r\nCaptain T. W. S. Kidd of Springfield was the crier of the court in the\r\ndays when Mr. Lincoln used to ride the circuit.\r\n\r\n“I was younger than he,” says Captain Kidd, “but he had a sort of\r\nadmiration for me, and never failed to get me into his stories. I was a\r\nstory-teller myself in those days, and he used to laugh very heartily at\r\nsome of the stories I told him.\r\n\r\n“Now and then he got me into a good deal of trouble. I was a Democrat,\r\nand was in politics more or less. A good many of our Democratic voters\r\nat that time were Irishmen. They came to Illinois in the days of the\r\nold canal, and did their honest share in making that piece of internal\r\nimprovement an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\n“One time Mr. Lincoln told the story of one of those important young\r\nfellows--not an Irishman--who lived in every town, and have the cares\r\nof state on their shoulders. This young fellow met an Irishman on the\r\nstreet, and called to him, officiously: ‘Oh, Mike, I’m awful glad I\r\nmet you. We’ve got to do something to wake up the boys. The campaign is\r\ncoming on, and we’ve got to get out voters. We’ve just had a meeting up\r\nhere, and we’re going to have the biggest barbecue that ever was heard\r\nof in Illinois. We are going to roast two whole oxen, and we’re going to\r\nhave Douglas and Governor Cass and some one from Kentucky, and all the\r\nbig Democratic guns, and we’re going to have a great big time.’\r\n\r\n“‘By dad, that’s good!’ says the Irishman. ‘The byes need stirrin’ up.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, and you’re on one of the committees, and you want to hustle\r\naround and get them waked up, Mike.’\r\n\r\n“‘When is the barbecue to be?’ asked Mike.\r\n\r\n“‘Friday, two weeks.’\r\n\r\n“‘Friday, is it? Well, I’ll make a nice committeeman, settin’ the\r\nbarbecue on a day with half of the Dimocratic party of Sangamon county\r\ncan’t ate a bite of mate. Go on wid ye.’\r\n\r\n“Lincoln told that story in one of his political speeches, and when the\r\nlaugh was over he said: ‘Now, gentlemen, I know that story is true, for\r\nTom Kidd told it to me.’ And then the Democrats would make trouble for\r\nme for a week afterward, and I’d have to explain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE’D SEE IT AGAIN.\r\n\r\nAbout two years before Lincoln was nominated for the Presidency he\r\nwent to Bloomington, Illinois, to try a case of some importance. His\r\nopponent--who afterward reached a high place in his profession--was a\r\nyoung man of ability, sensible but sensitive, and one to whom the loss\r\nof a case was a great blow. He therefore studied hard and made much\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nThis particular case was submitted to the jury late at night, and,\r\nalthough anticipating a favorable verdict, the young attorney spent a\r\nsleepless night in anxiety. Early next morning he learned, to his great\r\nchagrin, that he had lost the case.\r\n\r\nLincoln met him at the court-house some time after the jury had come in,\r\nand asked him what had become of his case.\r\n\r\nWith lugubrious countenance and in a melancholy tone the young man\r\nreplied, “It’s gone to hell.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” replied Lincoln, “then you will see it again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL ANOTHER WITNESS.\r\n\r\nWhen arguing a case in court, Mr. Lincoln never used a word which the\r\ndullest juryman could not understand. Rarely, if ever, did a Latin term\r\ncreep into his arguments. A lawyer, quoting a legal maxim one day\r\nin court, turned to Lincoln, and said: “That is so, is it not, Mr.\r\nLincoln?”\r\n\r\n“If that’s Latin.” Lincoln replied, “you had better call another\r\nwitness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONTEST WITH LITTLE “TAD.”\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter, the artist, relates the following incident: “Some\r\nphotographers came up to the White House to make some stereoscopic\r\nstudies for me of the President’s office. They requested a dark closet\r\nin which to develop the pictures, and, without a thought that I was\r\ninfringing upon anybody’s rights, I took them to an unoccupied room of\r\nwhich little ‘Tad’ had taken possession a few days before, and, with\r\nthe aid of a couple of servants, had fitted up a miniature theater, with\r\nstage, curtains, orchestra, stalls, parquette and all. Knowing that the\r\nuse required would interfere with none of his arrangements, I led the\r\nway to this apartment.\r\n\r\n“Everything went on well, and one or two pictures had been taken, when\r\nsuddenly there was an uproar. The operator came back to the office and\r\nsaid that ‘Tad’ had taken great offense at the occupation of his room\r\nwithout his consent, and had locked the door, refusing all admission.\r\n\r\n“The chemicals had been taken inside, and there was no way of getting at\r\nthem, he having carried off the key. In the midst of this conversation\r\n‘Tad’ burst in, in a fearful passion. He laid all the blame upon\r\nme--said that I had no right to use his room, and the men should not go\r\nin even to get their things. He had locked the door and they should not\r\ngo there again--‘they had no business in his room!’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln was sitting for a photograph, and was still in the chair.\r\nHe said, very mildly, ‘Tad, go and unlock the door.’ Tad went off\r\nmuttering into his mother’s room, refusing to obey. I followed him into\r\nthe passage, but no coaxing would pacify him. Upon my return to the\r\nPresident, I found him still patiently in the chair, from which he had\r\nnot risen. He said: ‘Has not the boy opened the door?’ I replied that we\r\ncould do nothing with him--he had gone off in a great pet. Mr. Lincoln’s\r\nlips came together firmly, and then, suddenly rising, he strode across\r\nthe passage with the air of one bent on punishment, and disappeared\r\nin the domestic apartments. Directly he returned with the key to the\r\ntheater, which he unlocked himself.\r\n\r\n“‘Tad,’ said he, half apologetically, ‘is a peculiar child. He was\r\nviolently excited when I went to him. I said, “Tad, do you know that you\r\nare making your father a great deal of trouble?” He burst into tears,\r\ninstantly giving me up the key.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINDED HIM OF “A LITTLE STORY.”\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln’s attention was called to the fact that, at one time in\r\nhis boyhood, he had spelled the name of the Deity with a small “g,” he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“That reminds me of a little story. It came about that a lot of\r\nConfederate mail was captured by the Union forces, and, while it was\r\nnot exactly the proper thing to do, some of our soldiers opened several\r\nletters written by the Southerners at the front to their people at home.\r\n\r\n“In one of these missives the writer, in a postscript, jotted down this\r\nassertion:\r\n\r\n“‘We’ll lick the Yanks termorrer, if goddlemity (God Almighty) spares\r\nour lives.’\r\n\r\n“That fellow was in earnest, too, as the letter was written the day\r\nbefore the second battle of Manassas.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“FETCHED SEVERAL SHORT ONES.”\r\n\r\n“The first time I ever remember seeing ‘Abe’ Lincoln,” is the testimony\r\nof one of his neighbors, “was when I was a small boy and had gone with\r\nmy father to attend some kind of an election. One of the neighbors,\r\nJames Larkins, was there.\r\n\r\n“Larkins was a great hand to brag on anything he owned. This time it was\r\nhis horse. He stepped up before ‘Abe,’ who was in a crowd, and commenced\r\ntalking to him, boasting all the while of his animal.\r\n\r\n“‘I have got the best horse in the country,’ he shouted to his young\r\nlistener. ‘I ran him nine miles in exactly three minutes, and he never\r\nfetched a long breath.’\r\n\r\n“‘I presume,’ said ‘Abe,’ rather dryly, ‘he fetched a good many short\r\nones, though.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN LUGS THE OLD MAN.\r\n\r\nOn May 3rd, 1862, “Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper” printed this\r\ncartoon, over the title of “Sandbag Lincoln and the Old Man of the Sea,\r\nSecretary of the Navy Welles.” It was intended to demonstrate that the\r\nhead of the Navy Department was incompetent to manage the affairs of the\r\nNavy; also that the Navy was not doing as good work as it might.\r\n\r\nWhen this cartoon was published, the United States Navy had cleared and\r\nhad under control the Mississippi River as far south as Memphis;\r\nhad blockaded all the cotton ports of the South; had assisted in the\r\nreduction of a number of Confederate forts; had aided Grant at Fort\r\nDonelson and the battle of Shiloh; the Monitor had whipped the ironclad\r\nterror, Merrimac (the Confederates called her the Virginia); Admiral\r\nFarragut’s fleet had compelled the surrender of the city of New Orleans,\r\nthe great forts which had defended it, and the Federal Government\r\nobtained control of the lower Mississippi.\r\n\r\n“The Old Man of the Sea” was therefore, not a drag or a weight upon\r\nPresident Lincoln, and the Navy was not so far behind in making a good\r\nrecord as the picture would have the people of the world believe. It was\r\nnot long after the Monitor’s victory that the United States Navy was\r\nthe finest that ever plowed the seas. The building of the Monitor also\r\nrevolutionized naval warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCLELLAN WAS “INTRENCHING.”\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the Chicago Convention, a gentleman from New York\r\ncalled upon the President, in company with the Assistant Secretary of\r\nWar, Mr. Dana.\r\n\r\nIn the course of conversation, the gentleman said: “What do you think,\r\nMr. President, is the reason General McClellan does not reply to the\r\nletter from the Chicago Convention?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied Mr. Lincoln, with a characteristic twinkle of the eye, “he\r\nis intrenching!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT, ANYWAY.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of his nomination by the Chicago convention, gifts poured\r\nin upon Lincoln. Many of these came in the form of wearing apparel. Mr.\r\nGeorge Lincoln, of Brooklyn, who brought to Springfield, in January,\r\n1861, a handsome silk hat to the President-elect, the gift of a New\r\nYork hatter, told some friends that in receiving the hat Lincoln laughed\r\nheartily over the gifts of clothing, and remarked to Mrs. Lincoln:\r\n“Well, wife, if nothing else comes out of this scrape, we are going to\r\nhave some new clothes, are we not?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICIOUS OXEN HAVE SHORT HORNS.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the many mean and petty acts of certain members of\r\nCongress, the President, while talking on the subject one day with\r\nfriends, said:\r\n\r\n“I have great sympathy for these men, because of their temper and their\r\nweakness; but I am thankful that the good Lord has given to the vicious\r\nox short horns, for if their physical courage were equal to their\r\nvicious disposition, some of us in this neck of the woods would get\r\nhurt.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S NAME FOR “WEEPING WATER.”\r\n\r\n“I was speaking one time to Mr. Lincoln,” said Governor Saunders, “of\r\nNebraska, of a little Nebraskan settlement on the Weeping Water, a\r\nstream in our State.”\r\n\r\n“‘Weeping Water!’ said he.\r\n\r\n“Then with a twinkle in his eye, he continued.\r\n\r\n“‘I suppose the Indians out there call Minneboohoo, don’t they? They\r\nought to, if Laughing Water is Minnehaha in their language.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER CARTWRIGHT’S DESCRIPTION OF LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nPeter Cartwright, the famous and eccentric old Methodist preacher, who\r\nused to ride a church circuit, as Mr. Lincoln and others did the court\r\ncircuit, did not like Lincoln very well, probably because Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas not a member of his flock, and once defeated the preacher for\r\nCongress. This was Cartwright’s description of Lincoln: “This Lincoln is\r\na man six feet four inches tall, but so angular that if you should\r\ndrop a plummet from the center of his head it would cut him three times\r\nbefore it touched his feet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO DEATHS IN HIS HOUSE.\r\n\r\nA gentleman was relating to the President how a friend of his had been\r\ndriven away from New Orleans as a Unionist, and how, on his expulsion,\r\nwhen he asked to see the writ by which he was expelled, the deputation\r\nwhich called on him told him the Government would do nothing illegal,\r\nand so they had issued no illegal writs, and simply meant to make him go\r\nof his own free will.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Lincoln, “that reminds me of a hotel-keeper down at St.\r\nLouis, who boasted that he never had a death in his hotel, for whenever\r\na guest was dying in his house he carried him out to die in the gutter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTED HIS PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nThe day following the adjournment of the Baltimore Convention, at which\r\nPresident Lincoln was renominated, various political organizations\r\ncalled to pay their respects to the President. While the Philadelphia\r\ndelegation was being presented, the chairman of that body, in\r\nintroducing one of the members, said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. President, this is Mr. S., of the second district of our State,--a\r\nmost active and earnest friend of yours and the cause. He has, among\r\nother things, been good enough to paint, and present to our league\r\nrooms, a most beautiful portrait of yourself.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln took the gentleman’s hand in his, and shaking it\r\ncordially said, with a merry voice, “I presume, sir, in painting your\r\nbeautiful portrait, you took your idea of me from my principles and not\r\nfrom my person.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGNIFYING THE STATUTE.\r\n\r\nLincoln was married--he balked at the first date set for the ceremony\r\nand did not show up at all--November 4, 1842, under most happy auspices.\r\nThe officiating clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Dresser, used the Episcopal\r\nchurch service for marriage. Lincoln placed the ring upon the bride’s\r\nfinger, and said, “With this ring I now thee wed, and with all my\r\nworldly goods I thee endow.”\r\n\r\nJudge Thomas C. Browne, who was present, exclaimed, “Good gracious,\r\nLincoln! the statute fixes all that!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” drawled Lincoln, “I just thought I’d add a little dignity to\r\nthe statute.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN CAMPAIGN MOTTOES.\r\n\r\nThe joint debates between Lincoln and Douglas were attended by crowds\r\nof people, and the arrival of both at the places of speaking were in the\r\nnature of a triumphal procession. In these processions there were many\r\nbanners bearing catch-phrases and mottoes expressing the sentiment of the\r\npeople on the candidates and the issues.\r\n\r\nThe following were some of the mottoes on the Lincoln banners:\r\n\r\n     +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n     |Westward the star of empire takes its way;                |\r\n     |The girls link on to Lincoln, their mothers were for Clay.|\r\n     +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n                 +----------------------+\r\n                 |Abe, the Giant-Killer.|\r\n                 +----------------------+\r\n\r\n            +---------------------------------+\r\n            |Edgar County for the Tall Sucker.|\r\n            +---------------------------------+\r\n\r\n            +----------------------------------+\r\n            |Free Territories and Free Men,    |\r\n            |  Free Pulpits and Free Preachers,|\r\n            |Free Press and a Free Pen,        |\r\n            |  Free Schools and Free Teachers. |\r\n            +----------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIVING AWAY THE CASE.\r\n\r\nBetween the first election and inauguration of Mr. Lincoln the disunion\r\nsentiment grew rapidly in the South, and President Buchanan’s failure to\r\nstop the open acts of secession grieved Mr. Lincoln sorely. Mr. Lincoln\r\nhad a long talk with his friend, Judge Gillespie, over the state of\r\naffairs. One incident of the conversation is thus narrated by the Judge:\r\n\r\n“When I retired, it was the master of the house and chosen ruler of the\r\ncountry who saw me to my room. ‘Joe,’ he said, as he was about to leave\r\nme, ‘I am reminded and I suppose you will never forget that trial down\r\nin Montgomery county, where the lawyer associated with you gave away the\r\nwhole case in his opening speech. I saw you signaling to him, but you\r\ncouldn’t stop him.\r\n\r\n“‘Now, that’s just the way with me and Buchanan. He is giving away the\r\ncase, and I have nothing to say, and can’t stop him. Good-night.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSING WITH A BROOMSTICK.\r\n\r\nMr. Leonard Volk, the artist, relates that, being in Springfield when\r\nLincoln’s nomination for President was announced, he called upon Mr.\r\nLincoln, whom he found looking smiling and happy. “I exclaimed, ‘I\r\nam the first man from Chicago, I believe, who has had the honor of\r\ncongratulating you on your nomination for President.’ Then those two\r\ngreat hands took both of mine with a grasp never to be forgotten,\r\nand while shaking, I said, ‘Now that you will doubtless be the next\r\nPresident of the United States, I want to make a statue of you, and\r\nshall try my best to do you justice.’\r\n\r\n“Said he, ‘I don’t doubt it, for I have come to the conclusion that you\r\nare an honest man,’ and with that greeting, I thought my hands in a fair\r\nway of being crushed.\r\n\r\n“On the Sunday following, by agreement, I called to make a cast of Mr.\r\nLincoln’s hands. I asked him to hold something in his hands, and told\r\nhim a stick would do. Thereupon he went to the woodshed, and I heard the\r\nsaw go, and he soon returned to the dining-room, whittling off the end\r\nof a piece of broom handle. I remarked to him that he need not whittle\r\noff the edges. ‘Oh, well,’ said he, ‘I thought I would like to have it\r\nnice.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“BOTH LENGTH AND BREADTH.”\r\n\r\nDuring Lincoln’s first and only term in Congress--he was elected in\r\n1846--he formed quite a cordial friendship with Stephen A. Douglas, a\r\nmember of the United States Senate from Illinois, and the beaten one in\r\nthe contest as to who should secure the hand of Miss Mary Todd. Lincoln\r\nwas the winner; Douglas afterwards beat him for the United States\r\nSenate, but Lincoln went to the White House.\r\n\r\nDuring all of the time that they were rivals in love and in politics\r\nthey remained the best of friends personally. They were always glad to\r\nsee each other, and were frequently together. The disparity in their\r\nsize was always the more noticeable upon such occasions, and they well\r\ndeserved their nicknames of “Long Abe” and the “Little Giant.” Lincoln\r\nwas the tallest man in the National House of Representatives, and\r\nDouglas the shortest (and perhaps broadest) man the Senate, and when\r\nthey appeared on the streets together much merriment was created.\r\nLincoln, when joked about the matter, replied, in a very serious tone,\r\n“Yes, that’s about the length and breadth of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” RECITES A SONG.\r\n\r\nLincoln couldn’t sing, and he also lacked the faculty of musical\r\nadaptation. He had a liking for certain ballads and songs, and while he\r\nmemorized and recited their lines, someone else did the singing. Lincoln\r\noften recited for the delectation of his friends, the following, the\r\nauthorship of which is unknown:\r\n\r\n  The first factional fight in old Ireland, they say,\r\n  Was all on account of St. Patrick’s birthday;\r\n  It was somewhere about midnight without any doubt,\r\n  And certain it is, it made a great rout.\r\n\r\n  On the eighth day of March, as some people say,\r\n  St. Patrick at midnight he first saw the day;\r\n  While others assert ‘twas the ninth he was born--\r\n  ‘Twas all a mistake--between midnight and morn.\r\n\r\n  Some blamed the baby, some blamed the clock;\r\n  Some blamed the doctor, some the crowing cock.\r\n  With all these close questions sure no one could know,\r\n  Whether the babe was too fast or the clock was too slow.\r\n\r\n  Some fought for the eighth, for the ninth some would die;\r\n  He who wouldn’t see right would have a black eye.\r\n  At length these two factions so positive grew,\r\n  They each had a birthday, and Pat he had two.\r\n\r\n  Till Father Mulcahay who showed them their sins,\r\n  He said none could have two birthdays but as twins.\r\n  “Now boys, don’t be fighting for the eight or the nine;\r\n  Don’t quarrel so always, now why not combine.”\r\n\r\n  Combine eight with nine. It is the mark;\r\n  Let that be the birthday. Amen! said the clerk.\r\n  So all got blind drunk, which completed their bliss,\r\n  And they’ve kept up the practice from that day to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MANAGE TO KEEP HOUSE.”\r\n\r\nSenator John Sherman, of Ohio, introduced his brother, William T.\r\nSherman (then a civilian) to President Lincoln in March, 1861. Sherman\r\nhad offered his services, but, as in the case of Grant, they had been\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nAfter the Senator had transacted his business with the President, he\r\nsaid: “Mr. President, this is my brother, Colonel Sherman, who is just\r\nup from Louisiana; he may give you some information you want.”\r\n\r\nTo this Lincoln replied, as reported by Senator Sherman himself: “Ah!\r\nHow are they getting along down there?”\r\n\r\nSherman answered: “They think they are getting along swimmingly; they\r\nare prepared for war.”\r\n\r\nTo which Lincoln responded: “Oh, well, I guess we’ll manage to keep the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“Tecump,” whose temper was not the mildest, broke out on “Brother John”\r\n as soon as they were out of the White House, cursed the politicians\r\nroundly, and wound up with, “You have got things in a h--l of a fix, and\r\nyou may get out as best you can.”\r\n\r\nSherman was one of the very few generals who gave Lincoln little or no\r\nworry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT “TUMBLED” RIGHT AWAY.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant told this story about Lincoln some years after the War:\r\n\r\n“Just after receiving my commission as lieutenant-general the President\r\ncalled me aside to speak to me privately. After a brief reference to\r\nthe military situation, he said he thought he could illustrate what he\r\nwanted to say by a story. Said he:\r\n\r\n“‘At one time there was a great war among the animals, and one side had\r\ngreat difficulty in getting a commander who had sufficient confidence in\r\nhimself. Finally they found a monkey by the name of Jocko, who said he\r\nthought he could command their army if his tail could be made a little\r\nlonger. So they got more tail and spliced it on to his caudal appendage.\r\n\r\n“‘He looked at it admiringly, and then said he thought he ought to\r\nhave still more tail. This was added, and again he called for more. The\r\nsplicing process was repeated many times until they had coiled Jocko’s\r\ntail around the room, filling all the space.\r\n\r\n“‘Still he called for more tail, and, there being no other place to coil\r\nit, they began wrapping it around his shoulders. He continued his call\r\nfor more, and they kept on winding the additional tail around him until\r\nits weight broke him down.’\r\n\r\n“I saw the point, and, rising from my chair, replied, ‘Mr. President, I\r\nwill not call for any more assistance unless I find it impossible to do\r\nwith what I already have.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“DON’T KILL HIM WITH YOUR FIST.”\r\n\r\nWard Lamon, Marshal of the District of Columbia during Lincoln’s time in\r\nWashington, was a powerful man; his strength was phenomenal, and a\r\nblow from his fist was like unto that coming from the business end of a\r\nsledge.\r\n\r\nLamon tells this story, the hero of which is not mentioned by name, but\r\nin all probability his identity can be guessed:\r\n\r\n“On one occasion, when the fears of the loyal element of the city\r\n(Washington) were excited to fever-heat, a free fight near the old\r\nNational Theatre occurred about eleven o’clock one night. An officer,\r\nin passing the place, observed what was going on, and seeing the great\r\nnumber of persons engaged, he felt it to be his duty to command the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n“The imperative tone of his voice stopped the fighting for a moment, but\r\nthe leader, a great bully, roughly pushed back the officer and told him\r\nto go away or he would whip him. The officer again advanced and said,\r\n‘I arrest you,’ attempting to place his hand on the man’s shoulder, when\r\nthe bully struck a fearful blow at the officer’s face.\r\n\r\n“This was parried, and instantly followed by a blow from the fist of the\r\nofficer, striking the fellow under the chin and knocking him senseless.\r\nBlood issued from his mouth, nose and ears. It was believed that the\r\nman’s neck was broken. A surgeon was called, who pronounced the case a\r\ncritical one, and the wounded man was hurried away on a litter to the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n“There the physicians said there was concussion of the brain, and that\r\nthe man would die. All the medical skill that the officer could procure\r\nwas employed in the hope of saving the life of the man. His\r\nconscience smote him for having, as he believed, taken the life of a\r\nfellow-creature, and he was inconsolable.\r\n\r\n“Being on terms of intimacy with the President, about two o’clock that\r\nnight the officer went to the White House, woke up Mr. Lincoln, and\r\nrequested him to come into his office, where he told him his story. Mr.\r\nLincoln listened with great interest until the narrative was completed,\r\nand then asked a few questions, after which he remarked:\r\n\r\n“‘I am sorry you had to kill the man, but these are times of war, and\r\na great many men deserve killing. This one, according to your story,\r\nis one of them; so give yourself no uneasiness about the matter. I will\r\nstand by you.’\r\n\r\n“‘That is not why I came to you. I knew I did my duty, and had no fears\r\nof your disapproval of what I did,’ replied the officer; and then he\r\nadded: ‘Why I came to you was, I felt great grief over the unfortunate\r\naffair, and I wanted to talk to you about it.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln then said, with a smile, placing his hand on the officer’\r\nshoulder: ‘You go home now and get some sleep; but let me give you this\r\npiece of advice--hereafter, when you have occasion to strike a man,\r\ndon’t hit him with your fist; strike him with a club, a crowbar, or with\r\nsomething that won’t kill him.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOULD BE ARBITRARY.\r\n\r\nLincoln could be arbitrary when occasion required. This is the letter he\r\nwrote to one of the Department heads:\r\n\r\n“You must make a job of it, and provide a place for the bearer of this,\r\nElias Wampole. Make a job of it with the collector and have it done. You\r\ncan do it for me, and you must.”\r\n\r\nThere was no delay in taking action in this matter. Mr. Wampole, or\r\n“Eli,” as he was thereafter known, “got there.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GENERAL BUSTIFICATION.\r\n\r\nMany amusing stories are told of President Lincoln and his gloves. At\r\nabout the time of his third reception he had on a tight-fitting pair of\r\nwhite kids, which he had with difficulty got on. He saw approaching in\r\nthe distance an old Illinois friend named Simpson, whom he welcomed with\r\na genuine Sangamon county (Illeenoy) shake, which resulted in bursting\r\nhis white kid glove, with an audible sound. Then, raising his brawny\r\nhand up before him, looking at it with an indescribable expression, he\r\nsaid, while the whole procession was checked, witnessing this scene:\r\n\r\n“Well, my old friend, this is a general bustification. You and I were\r\nnever intended to wear these things. If they were stronger they might do\r\nwell enough to keep out the cold, but they are a failure to shake hands\r\nwith between old friends like us. Stand aside, Captain, and I’ll see you\r\nshortly.”\r\n\r\nSimpson stood aside, and after the unwelcome ceremony was terminated he\r\nrejoined his old Illinois friend in familiar intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING QUARTERMASTERS.\r\n\r\nH. C. Whitney wrote in 1866: “I was in Washington in the Indian service\r\nfor a few days before August, 1861, and I merely said to President\r\nLincoln one day: ‘Everything is drifting into the war, and I guess you\r\nwill have to put me in the army.’\r\n\r\n“The President looked up from his work and said, good-humoredly:\r\n‘I’m making generals now; in a few days I will be making quartermasters,\r\nand then I’ll fix you.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO POSTMASTERS IN HIS POCKET.\r\n\r\nIn the “Diary of a Public Man” appears this jocose anecdote:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln walked into the corridor with us; and, as he bade us\r\ngood-by and thanked Blank for what he had told him, he again brightened\r\nup for a moment and asked him in an abrupt kind of way, laying his hand\r\nas he spoke with a queer but not uncivil familiarity on his shoulder,\r\n‘You haven’t such a thing as a postmaster in your pocket, have you?’\r\n\r\n“Blank stared at him in astonishment, and I thought a little in alarm, as\r\nif he suspected a sudden attack of insanity; then Mr. Lincoln went on:\r\n\r\n‘You see it seems to me kind of unnatural that you shouldn’t have at\r\nleast a postmaster in your pocket. Everybody I’ve seen for days past has\r\nhad foreign ministers and collectors, and all kinds, and I thought you\r\ncouldn’t have got in here without having at least a postmaster get into\r\nyour pocket!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE “SKEWED” THE LINE.\r\n\r\nWhen a surveyor, Mr. Lincoln first platted the town of Petersburg, Ill.\r\nSome twenty or thirty years afterward the property-owners along one\r\nof the outlying streets had trouble in fixing their boundaries. They\r\nconsulted the official plat and got no relief. A committee was sent\r\nto Springfield to consult the distinguished surveyor, but he failed to\r\nrecall anything that would give them aid, and could only refer them to\r\nthe record. The dispute therefore went into the courts. While the trial\r\nwas pending, an old Irishman named McGuire, who had worked for some\r\nfarmer during the summer, returned to town for the winter. The case\r\nbeing mentioned in his presence, he promptly said: “I can tell you all\r\nabout it. I helped carry the chain when Abe Lincoln laid out this\r\ntown. Over there where they are quarreling about the lines, when he was\r\nlocating the street, he straightened up from his instrument and said:\r\n‘If I run that street right through, it will cut three or four feet off\r\nthe end of ----‘s house. It’s all he’s got in the world and he never\r\ncould get another. I reckon it won’t hurt anything out here if I skew\r\nthe line a little and miss him.”’\r\n\r\nThe line was “skewed,” and hence the trouble, and more testimony\r\nfurnished as to Lincoln’s abounding kindness of heart, that would not\r\nwillingly harm any human being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHEREAS,” HE STOLE NOTHING.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated courts-martial during the War was that\r\nof Franklin W. Smith and his brother, charged with defrauding the\r\ngovernment. These men bore a high character for integrity. At this time,\r\nhowever, courts-martial were seldom invoked for any other purpose than\r\nto convict the accused, and the Smiths shared the usual fate of persons\r\nwhose cases were submitted to such arbitrament. They were kept in\r\nprison, their papers seized, their business destroyed, and their\r\nreputations ruined, all of which was followed by a conviction.\r\n\r\nThe finding of the court was submitted to the President, who, after a\r\ncareful investigation, disapproved the judgment, and wrote the following\r\nendorsement upon the papers:\r\n\r\n“Whereas, Franklin W. Smith had transactions with the Navy Department to\r\nthe amount of a million and a quarter of dollars; and:\r\n\r\n“Whereas, he had a chance to steal at least a quarter of a million\r\nand was only charged with stealing twenty-two hundred dollars, and the\r\nquestion now is about his stealing one hundred, I don’t believe he stole\r\nanything at all.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, the record and the findings are disapproved, declared null\r\nand void, and the defendants are fully discharged.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT LIKE THE POPE’S BULL.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, after listening to the arguments and appeals of a\r\ncommittee which called upon him at the White House not long before the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation was issued, said:\r\n\r\n“I do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must\r\nnecessarily be inoperative, like the Pope’s bull against the comet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOULD HE TELL?\r\n\r\nA “high” private of the One Hundred and Fortieth Infantry Regiment,\r\nPennsylvania Volunteers, wounded at Chancellorsville, was taken to\r\nWashington. One day, as he was becoming convalescent, a whisper ran down\r\nthe long row of cots that the President was in the building and would\r\nsoon pass by. Instantly every boy in blue who was able arose, stood\r\nerect, hands to the side, ready to salute his Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian stood six feet seven inches in his stockings. Lincoln\r\nwas six feet four. As the President approached this giant towering above\r\nhim, he stopped in amazement, and casting his eyes from head to foot\r\nand from foot to head, as if contemplating the immense distance from one\r\nextremity to the other, he stood for a moment speechless.\r\n\r\nAt length, extending his hand, he exclaimed, “Hello, comrade, do you\r\nknow when your feet get cold?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDARNED UNCOMFORTABLE SITTING.\r\n\r\n“Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper” of March 2nd, 1861, two days\r\nprevious to the inauguration of President-elect Lincoln, contained the\r\ncaricature reproduced here. It was intended to convey the idea that\r\nthe National Administration would thereafter depend upon the support\r\nof bayonets to uphold it, and the text underneath the picture ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOLD ABE: “Oh, it’s all well enough to say that I must support the\r\ndignity of my high office by force--but it’s darned uncomfortable\r\nsitting, I can tell yer.”\r\n\r\nThis journal was not entirely friendly to the new Chief Magistrate, but\r\nit could not see into the future. Many of the leading publications of\r\nthe East, among them some of those which condemned slavery and were\r\nopposed to secession, did not believe Lincoln was the man for the\r\nemergency, but instead of doing what they could do to help him along,\r\nthey attacked him most viciously. No man, save Washington, was more\r\nbrutally lied about than Lincoln, but he bore all the slurs and thrusts,\r\nnot to mention the open, cruel antagonism of those who should have been\r\nhis warmest friends, with a fortitude and patience few men have ever\r\nshown. He was on the right road, and awaited the time when his course\r\nshould receive the approval it merited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHAT’S-HIS-NAME” GOT THERE.\r\n\r\nGeneral James B. Fry told a good one on Secretary of War Stanton,\r\nwho was worsted in a contention with the President. Several\r\nbrigadier-generals were to be selected, and Lincoln maintained that\r\n“something must be done in the interest of the Dutch.” Many complaints\r\nhad come from prominent men, born in the Fatherland, but who were\r\nfighting for the Union.\r\n\r\n“Now, I want Schimmelpfennig given one of those brigadierships.”\r\n\r\nStanton was stubborn and headstrong, as usual, but his manner and tone\r\nindicated that the President would have his own way in the end. However,\r\nhe was not to be beaten without having made a fight.\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. President,” insisted the Iron War Secretary, “it may be that\r\nthis Mr. Schim--what’s-his-name--has no recommendations showing his\r\nfitness. Perhaps he can’t speak English.”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t matter a bit, Stanton,” retorted Lincoln, “he may be deaf\r\nand dumb for all I know, but whatever language he speaks, if any, we can\r\nfurnish troops who will understand what he says. That name of his will\r\nmake up for any differences in religion, politics or understanding, and\r\nI’ll take the risk of his coming out all right.”\r\n\r\nThen, slamming his great hand upon the Secretary’s desk, he said,\r\n“Schim-mel-fen-nig must be appointed.”\r\n\r\nAnd he was, there and then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA REALLY GREAT GENERAL.\r\n\r\n“Do you know General A--?” queried the President one day to a friend who\r\nhad “dropped in” at the White House.\r\n\r\n“Certainly; but you are not wasting any time thinking about him, are\r\nyou?” was the rejoinder.\r\n\r\n“You wrong him,” responded the President, “he is a really great man, a\r\nphilosopher.”\r\n\r\n“How do you make that out? He isn’t worth the powder and ball necessary\r\nto kill him so I have heard military men say,” the friend remarked.\r\n\r\n“He is a mighty thinker,” the President returned, “because he has\r\nmastered that ancient and wise admonition, ‘Know thyself;’ he has formed\r\nan intimate acquaintance with himself, knows as well for what he is\r\nfitted and unfitted as any man living. Without doubt he is a remarkable\r\nman. This War has not produced another like him.”\r\n\r\n“How is it you are so highly pleased with General A---- all at once?”\r\n\r\n“For the reason,” replied Mr. Lincoln, with a merry twinkle of the\r\neye, “greatly to my relief, and to the interests of the country, he has\r\nresigned. The country should express its gratitude in some substantial\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SHRUNK UP NORTH.”\r\n\r\nThere was no member of the Cabinet from the South when Attorney-General\r\nBates handed in his resignation, and President Lincoln had a great deal\r\nof trouble in making a selection. Finally Titian F. Coffey consented to\r\nfill the vacant place for a time, and did so until the appointment of\r\nMr. Speed.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with Mr. Coffey the President quaintly remarked:\r\n\r\n“My Cabinet has shrunk up North, and I must find a Southern man. I\r\nsuppose if the twelve Apostles were to be chosen nowadays, the shrieks\r\nof locality would have to be heeded.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN ADOPTED THE SUGGESTION.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that President Lincoln adopted a suggestion\r\nmade by Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase in regard to the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, and incorporated it in that famous document.\r\n\r\nAfter the President had read it to the members of the Cabinet he\r\nasked if he had omitted anything which should be added or inserted to\r\nstrengthen it. It will be remembered that the closing paragraph of the\r\nProclamation reads in this way:\r\n\r\n“And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice warranted\r\nby the Constitution, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and\r\nthe gracious favor of Almighty God!” President Lincoln’s draft of the\r\npaper ended with the word “mankind,” and the words, “and the gracious\r\nfavor of Almighty God,” were those suggested by Secretary Chase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.\r\n\r\nIt was the President’s overweening desire to accommodate all persons\r\nwho came to him soliciting favors, but the opportunity was never offered\r\nuntil an untimely and unthinking disease, which possessed many of the\r\ncharacteristics of one of the most dreaded maladies, confined him to his\r\nbed at the White House.\r\n\r\nThe rumor spread that the President was afflicted with this disease,\r\nwhile the truth was that it was merely a very mild attack of varioloid.\r\nThe office-seekers didn’t know the facts, and for once the Executive\r\nMansion was clear of them.\r\n\r\nOne day, a man from the West, who didn’t read the papers, but wanted the\r\npostoffice in his town, called at the White House. The President,\r\nbeing then practically a well man, saw him. The caller was engaged in\r\na voluble endeavor to put his capabilities in the most favorable light,\r\nwhen the President interrupted him with the remark that he would be\r\ncompelled to make the interview short, as his doctor was due.\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. President, are you sick?” queried the visitor.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing much,” replied Mr. Lincoln, “but the physician says he\r\nfears the worst.”\r\n\r\n“What worst, may I ask?”\r\n\r\n“Smallpox,” was the answer; “but you needn’t be scared. I’m only in the\r\nfirst stages now.”\r\n\r\nThe visitor grabbed his hat, sprang from his chair, and without a word\r\nbolted for the door.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be in a hurry,” said the President placidly; “sit down and talk\r\nawhile.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir; I’ll call again,” shouted the Westerner, as he\r\ndisappeared through the opening in the wall.\r\n\r\n“Now, that’s the way with people,” the President said, when relating\r\nthe story afterward. “When I can’t give them what they want, they’re\r\ndissatisfied, and say harsh things about me; but when I’ve something to\r\ngive to everybody they scamper off.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO MANY PIGS FOR THE TEATS.\r\n\r\nAn applicant for a sutlership in the army relates this story: “In the\r\nwinter of 1864, after serving three years in the Union Army, and being\r\nhonorably discharged, I made application for the post sutlership at\r\nPoint Lookout. My father being interested, we made application to Mr.\r\nStanton, the Secretary of War. We obtained an audience, and were ushered\r\ninto the presence of the most pompous man I ever met. As I entered he\r\nwaved his hand for me to stop at a given distance from him, and then put\r\nthese questions, viz.:\r\n\r\n“‘Did you serve three years in the army?’\r\n\r\n“‘I did, sir.’\r\n\r\n“‘Were you honorably discharged?’\r\n\r\n“‘I was, sir.’\r\n\r\n“‘Let me see your discharge.’\r\n\r\n“I gave it to him. He looked it over, then said:\r\n\r\n‘Were you ever wounded?’ I told him yes, at the battle of Williamsburg,\r\nMay 5, 1861.\r\n\r\n“He then said: ‘I think we can give this position to a soldier who has\r\nlost an arm or leg, he being more deserving; and he then said I looked\r\nhearty and healthy enough to serve three years more. He would not give\r\nme a chance to argue my case.\r\n\r\n“The audience was at an end. He waved his hand to me. I was then\r\ndismissed from the august presence of the Honorable Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n“My father was waiting for me in the hallway, who saw by my countenance\r\nthat I was not successful. I said to my father:\r\n\r\n“‘Let us go over to Mr. Lincoln; he may give us more satisfaction.’\r\n\r\n“He said it would do me no good, but we went over. Mr. Lincoln’s\r\nreception room was full of ladies and gentlemen when we entered.\r\n\r\n“My turn soon came. Lincoln turned to my father and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Now, gentlemen, be pleased to be as quick as possible with your\r\nbusiness, as it is growing late.’\r\n\r\n“My father then stepped up to Lincoln and introduced me to him. Lincoln\r\nthen said:\r\n\r\n“‘Take a seat, gentlemen, and state your business as quickly as\r\npossible.’\r\n\r\n“There was but one chair by Lincoln, so he motioned my father to sit,\r\nwhile I stood. My father stated the business to him as stated above. He\r\nthen said:\r\n\r\n“‘Have you seen Mr. Stanton?’\r\n\r\n“We told him yes, that he had refused. He (Mr. Lincoln) then said:\r\n\r\n“‘Gentlemen, this is Mr. Stanton’s business; I cannot interfere with\r\nhim; he attends to all these matters and I am sorry I cannot help you.’\r\n\r\n“He saw that we were disappointed, and did his best to revive our\r\nspirits. He succeeded well with my father, who was a Lincoln man, and\r\nwho was a staunch Republican.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln then said:\r\n\r\n“‘Now, gentlemen, I will tell you, what it is; I have thousands of\r\napplications like this every day, but we cannot satisfy all for this\r\nreason, that these positions are like office seekers--there are too many\r\npigs for the teats.’\r\n\r\n“The ladies who were listening to the conversation placed their\r\nhandkerchiefs to their faces and turned away. But the joke of ‘Old Abe’\r\nput us all in a good humor. We then left the presence of the greatest\r\nand most just man who ever lived to fill the Presidential chair.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREELEY CARRIES LINCOLN TO THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Abraham Lincoln made the candidate for the Presidency of\r\nthe Republican Party, in 1860, than the opposition began to lampoon and\r\ncaricature him. In the cartoon here reproduced, which is given the title\r\nof:\r\n\r\n“The Republican Party Going to the Right House,” Lincoln is represented\r\nas entering the Lunatic Asylum, riding on a rail, carried by\r\nHorace Greeley, the great Abolitionist; Lincoln, followed by his\r\n“fellow-cranks,” is assuring the latter that the millennium is “going to\r\nbegin,” and that all requests will be granted.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s followers are depicted as those men and women composing the\r\n“free love” element; those who want religion abolished; negroes, who\r\nwant it understood that the white man has no rights his black brother is\r\nbound to respect; women suffragists, who demand that men be made subject\r\nto female authority; tramps, who insist upon free lodging-houses;\r\ncriminals, who demand the right to steal from all they meet; and toughs,\r\nwho want the police forces abolished, so that “the b’hoys” can “run\r\nwid de masheen,” and have “a muss” whenever they feel like it, without\r\ninterference by the authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST TIME HE SAW DOUGLAS.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his last meeting with Judge Douglas, Mr. Lincoln said:\r\n“One day Douglas came rushing in and said he had just got a telegraph\r\ndispatch from some friends in Illinois urging him to come out and help\r\nset things right in Egypt, and that he would go, or stay in Washington,\r\njust where I thought he could do the most good.\r\n\r\n“I told him to do as he chose, but that probably he could do best in\r\nIllinois. Upon that he shook hands with me, and hurried away to catch\r\nthe next train. I never saw him again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHURT HIS LEGS LESS.\r\n\r\nLincoln was one of the attorneys in a case of considerable importance,\r\ncourt being held in a very small and dilapidated schoolhouse out in the\r\ncountry; Lincoln was compelled to stoop very much in order to enter\r\nthe door, and the seats were so low that he doubled up his legs like a\r\njackknife.\r\n\r\nLincoln was obliged to sit upon a school bench, and just in front of him\r\nwas another, making the distance between him and the seat in front of\r\nhim very narrow and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHis position was almost unbearable, and in order to carry out his\r\npreference which he secured as often as possible, and that was “to sit\r\nas near to the jury as convenient,” he took advantage of his discomfort\r\nand finally said to the Judge on the “bench”:\r\n\r\n“Your Honor, with your permission, I’ll sit up nearer to the gentlemen\r\nof the jury, for it hurts my legs less to rub my calves against the\r\nbench than it does to skin my shins.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE SHY OR GRAMMAR.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln had prepared his brief letter accepting the\r\nPresidential nomination he took it to Dr. Newton Bateman, the State\r\nSuperintendent of Education.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Schoolmaster,” he said, “here is my letter of acceptance. I am\r\nnot very strong on grammar and I wish you to see if it is all right. I\r\nwouldn’t like to have any mistakes in it.”.\r\n\r\nThe doctor took the letter and after reading it, said:\r\n\r\n“There is only one change I should suggest, Mr. Lincoln, you have\r\nwritten ‘It shall be my care to not violate or disregard it in any\r\npart,’ you should have written ‘not to violate.’ Never split an\r\ninfinitive, is the rule.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln took the manuscript, regarding it a moment with a puzzled\r\nair, “So you think I better put those two little fellows end to end, do\r\nyou?” he said as he made the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FIRST SATIRICAL WRITING.\r\n\r\nReuben and Charles Grigsby were married in Spencer county, Indiana, on\r\nthe same day to Elizabeth Ray and Matilda Hawkins, respectively. They\r\nmet the next day at the home of Reuben Grigsby, Sr., and held a double\r\ninfare, to which most of the county was invited, with the exception of\r\nthe Lincolns. This Abraham duly resented, and it resulted in his\r\nfirst attempt at satirical writing, which he called “The Chronicles of\r\nReuben.”\r\n\r\nThe manuscript was lost, and not recovered until 1865, when a house\r\nbelonging to one of the Grigsbys was torn down. In the loft a boy found\r\na roll of musty old papers, and was intently reading them, when he was\r\nasked what he was doing.\r\n\r\n“Reading a portion of the Scriptures that haven’t been revealed yet,”\r\n was the response. This was Lincoln’s “Chronicles,” which is herewith\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n“THE CHRONICLES OF REUBEN.”\r\n\r\n“Now, there was a man whose name was Reuben, and the same was very\r\ngreat in substance, in horses and cattle and swine, and a very great\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n“It came to pass when the sons of Reuben grew up that they were desirous\r\nof taking to themselves wives, and, being too well known as to honor\r\nin their own country, they took a journey into a far country and there\r\nprocured for themselves wives.\r\n\r\n“It came to pass also that when they were about to make the return home\r\nthey sent a messenger before them to bear the tidings to their parents.\r\n\r\n“These, inquiring of the messenger what time their sons and wives would\r\ncome, made a great feast and called all their kinsmen and neighbors in,\r\nand made great preparation.\r\n\r\n“When the time drew nigh, they sent out two men to meet the grooms and\r\ntheir brides, with a trumpet to welcome them, and to accompany them.\r\n\r\n“When they came near unto the house of Reuben, the father, the messenger\r\ncame before them and gave a shout, and the whole multitude ran out with\r\nshouts of joy and music, playing on all kinds of instruments.\r\n\r\n“Some were playing on harps, some on viols, and some blowing on rams’\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\n“Some also were casting dust and ashes toward Heaven, and chief among\r\nthem all was Josiah, blowing his bugle and making sounds so great the\r\nneighboring hills and valleys echoed with the resounding acclamation.\r\n\r\n“When they had played and their harps had sounded till the grooms and\r\nbrides approached the gates, Reuben, the father, met them and welcomed\r\nthem to his house.\r\n\r\n“The wedding feast being now ready, they were all invited to sit down\r\nand eat, placing the bridegrooms and their brides at each end of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“Waiters were then appointed to serve and wait on the guests. When all\r\nhad eaten and were full and merry, they went out again and played and\r\nsung till night.\r\n\r\n“And when they had made an end of feasting and rejoicing the multitude\r\ndispersed, each going to his own home.\r\n\r\n“The family then took seats with their waiters to converse while\r\npreparations were being made in two upper chambers for the brides and\r\ngrooms.\r\n\r\n“This being done, the waiters took the two brides upstairs, placing one\r\nin a room at the right hand of the stairs and the other on the left.\r\n\r\n“The waiters came down, and Nancy, the mother, then gave directions to\r\nthe waiters of the bridegrooms, and they took them upstairs, but placed\r\nthem in the wrong rooms.\r\n\r\n“The waiters then all came downstairs.\r\n\r\n“But the mother, being fearful of a mistake, made inquiry of the\r\nwaiters, and learning the true facts, took the light and sprang\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n“It came to pass she ran to one of the rooms and exclaimed, ‘O Lord,\r\nReuben, you are with the wrong wife.’\r\n\r\n“The young men, both alarmed at this, ran out with such violence against\r\neach other, they came near knocking each other down.\r\n\r\n“The tumult gave evidence to those below that the mistake was certain.\r\n\r\n“At last they all came down and had a long conversation about who made\r\nthe mistake, but it could not be decided.\r\n\r\n“So ended the chapter.”\r\n\r\nThe original manuscript of “The Chronicles of Reuben” was last in the\r\npossession of Redmond Grigsby, of Rockport, Indiana. A newspaper which\r\nhad obtained a copy of the “Chronicles,” sent a reporter to interview\r\nElizabeth Grigsby, or Aunt Betsy, as she was called, and asked her about\r\nthe famous manuscript and the mistake made at the double wedding.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they did have a joke on us,” said Aunt Betsy. “They said my man\r\ngot into the wrong room and Charles got into my room. But it wasn’t so.\r\nLincoln just wrote that for mischief. Abe and my man often laughed about\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIKELY TO DO IT.\r\n\r\nAn officer, having had some trouble with General Sherman, being very\r\nangry, presented himself before Mr. Lincoln, who was visiting the camp,\r\nand said, “Mr. President, I have a cause of grievance. This morning I\r\nwent to General Sherman and he threatened to shoot me.”\r\n\r\n“Threatened to shoot you?” asked Mr. Lincoln. “Well, (in a stage\r\nwhisper) if I were you I would keep away from him; if he threatens to\r\nshoot, I would not trust him, for I believe he would do it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE ENEMY ARE ‘OURN’”\r\n\r\nEarly in the Presidential campaign of 1864, President Lincoln said one\r\nnight to a late caller at the White House:\r\n\r\n“We have met the enemy and they are ‘ourn!’ I think the cabal of\r\nobstructionists ‘am busted.’ I feel certain that, if I live, I am going\r\nto be re-elected. Whether I deserve to be or not, it is not for me\r\nto say; but on the score even of remunerative chances for speculative\r\nservice, I now am inspired with the hope that our disturbed country\r\nfurther requires the valuable services of your humble servant. ‘Jordan\r\nhas been a hard road to travel,’ but I feel now that, notwithstanding\r\nthe enemies I have made and the faults I have committed, I’ll be dumped\r\non the right side of that stream.\r\n\r\n“I hope, however, that I may never have another four years of such\r\nanxiety, tribulation and abuse. My only ambition is and has been to put\r\ndown the rebellion and restore peace, after which I want to resign\r\nmy office, go abroad, take some rest, study foreign governments, see\r\nsomething of foreign life, and in my old age die in peace with all of\r\nthe good of God’s creatures.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“AND--HERE I AM!”\r\n\r\nAn old acquaintance of the President visited him in Washington. Lincoln\r\ndesired to give him a place. Thus encouraged, the visitor, who was an\r\nhonest man, but wholly inexperienced in public affairs or business,\r\nasked for a high office, Superintendent of the Mint.\r\n\r\nThe President was aghast, and said: “Good gracious! Why didn’t he ask to\r\nbe Secretary of the Treasury, and have done with it?”\r\n\r\nAfterward, he said: “Well, now, I never thought Mr.---- had anything\r\nmore than average ability, when we were young men together. But, then, I\r\nsuppose he thought the same thing about me, and--here I am!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFE AS LONG AS THEY WERE GOOD.\r\n\r\nAt the celebrated Peace Conference, whereat there was much “pow-wow”\r\n and no result, President Lincoln, in response to certain remarks by the\r\nConfederate commissioners, commented with some severity upon the conduct\r\nof the Confederate leaders, saying they had plainly forfeited all right\r\nto immunity from punishment for their treason.\r\n\r\nBeing positive and unequivocal in stating his views concerning\r\nindividual treason, his words were of ominous import. There was a pause,\r\nduring which Commissioner Hunter regarded the speaker with a steady,\r\nsearching look. At length, carefully measuring his words, Mr. Hunter\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Then, Mr. President, if we understand you correctly, you think that\r\nwe of the Confederacy have committed treason; are traitors to your\r\nGovernment; have forfeited our rights, and are proper subjects for the\r\nhangman. Is not that about what your words imply?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied President Lincoln, “you have stated the proposition\r\nbetter than I did. That is about the size of it!”\r\n\r\nAnother pause, and a painful one succeeded, and then Hunter, with a\r\npleasant smile remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Lincoln, we have about concluded that we shall not be hanged\r\nas long as you are President--if we behave ourselves.”\r\n\r\nAnd Hunter meant what he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SMELT NO ROYALTY IN OUR CARRIAGE.”\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, in going to meet an appointment in the southern part of\r\nthe Sucker State--that section of Illinois called Egypt--Lincoln, with\r\nother friends, was traveling in the “caboose” of a freight train, when\r\nthe freight was switched off the main track to allow a special train to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s more aristocratic rival (Stephen A. Douglas) was being\r\nconveyed to the same town in this special. The passing train was\r\ndecorated with banners and flags, and carried a band of music, which was\r\nplaying “Hail to the Chief.”\r\n\r\nAs the train whistled past, Lincoln broke out in a fit of laughter, and\r\nsaid: “Boys, the gentleman in that car evidently smelt no royalty in our\r\ncarriage.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELL A MILE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nWard Lamon told this story of President Lincoln, whom he found one day\r\nin a particularly gloomy frame of mind. Lamon said:\r\n\r\n“The President remarked, as I came in, ‘I fear I have made Senator Wade,\r\nof Ohio, my enemy for life.’\r\n\r\n“‘How?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ continued the President, ‘Wade was here just now urging me\r\nto dismiss Grant, and, in response to something he said, I remarked,\r\n“Senator, that reminds me of a story.”’\r\n\r\n“‘What did Wade say?’ I inquired of the President.\r\n\r\n“‘He said, in a petulant way,’ the President responded, ‘“It is with\r\nyou, sir, all story, story! You are the father of every military blunder\r\nthat has been made during the war. You are on your road to hell, sir,\r\nwith this government, by your obstinacy, and you are not a mile off this\r\nminute.”’\r\n\r\n“‘What did you say then?’\r\n\r\n“I good-naturedly said to him,’ the President replied, ‘“Senator, that\r\nis just about from here to the Capitol, is it not?” He was very angry,\r\ngrabbed up his hat and cane, and went away.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS “GLASS HACK”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln had not been in the White House very long before Mrs.\r\nLincoln became seized with the idea that a fine new barouche was about\r\nthe proper thing for “the first lady in the land.” The President did not\r\ncare particularly about it one way or the other, and told his wife to\r\norder whatever she wanted.\r\n\r\nLincoln forgot all about the new vehicle, and was overcome with\r\nastonishment one afternoon when, having acceded to Mrs. Lincoln’s desire\r\nto go driving, he found a beautiful barouche standing in front of the\r\ndoor of the White House.\r\n\r\nHis wife watched him with an amused smile, but the only remark he made\r\nwas, “Well, Mary, that’s about the slickest ‘glass hack’ in town, isn’t\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAVE HIM KICKING.\r\n\r\nLincoln, in the days of his youth, was often unfaithful to his Quaker\r\ntraditions. On the day of election in 1840, word came to him that one\r\nRadford, a Democratic contractor, had taken possession of one of the\r\npolling places with his workmen, and was preventing the Whigs from\r\nvoting. Lincoln started off at a gait which showed his interest in the\r\nmatter in hand.\r\n\r\nHe went up to Radford and persuaded him to leave the polls, remarking\r\nat the same time: “Radford, you’ll spoil and blow, if you live much\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\nRadford’s prudence prevented an actual collision, which, it is said,\r\nLincoln regretted. He told his friend Speed he wanted Radford to show\r\nfight so that he might “knock him down and leave him kicking.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHO COMMENCED THIS FUSS?”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was at all times an advocate of peace, provided it\r\ncould be obtained honorably and with credit to the United States. As\r\nto the cause of the Civil War, which side of Mason and Dixon’s line was\r\nresponsible for it, who fired the first shots, who were the aggressors,\r\netc., Lincoln did not seem to bother about; he wanted to preserve the\r\nUnion, above all things. Slavery, he was assured, was dead, but he\r\nthought the former slaveholders should be recompensed.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate his feelings in the matter he told this story:\r\n\r\n“Some of the supporters of the Union cause are opposed to accommodate or\r\nyield to the South in any manner or way because the Confederates began\r\nthe war; were determined to take their States out of the Union, and,\r\nconsequently, should be held responsible to the last stage for whatever\r\nmay come in the future. Now this reminds me of a good story I heard\r\nonce, when I lived in Illinois.\r\n\r\n“A vicious bull in a pasture took after everybody who tried to cross the\r\nlot, and one day a neighbor of the owner was the victim. This man was a\r\nspeedy fellow and got to a friendly tree ahead of the bull, but not in\r\ntime to climb the tree. So he led the enraged animal a merry race around\r\nthe tree, finally succeeding in seizing the bull by the tail.\r\n\r\n“The bull, being at a disadvantage, not able to either catch the man or\r\nrelease his tail, was mad enough to eat nails; he dug up the earth with\r\nhis feet, scattered gravel all around, bellowed until you could hear\r\nhim for two miles or more, and at length broke into a dead run, the man\r\nhanging onto his tail all the time.\r\n\r\n“While the bull, much out of temper, was legging it to the best of his\r\nability, his tormentor, still clinging to the tail, asked, ‘Darn you,\r\nwho commenced this fuss?’\r\n\r\n“It’s our duty to settle this fuss at the earliest possible moment, no\r\nmatter who commenced it. That’s my idea of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE’S” LITTLE JOKE.\r\n\r\nWhen General W. T. Sherman, November 12th, 1864, severed all\r\ncommunication with the North and started for Savannah with his\r\nmagnificent army of sixty thousand men, there was much anxiety for\r\na month as to his whereabouts. President Lincoln, in response to an\r\ninquiry, said: “I know what hole Sherman went in at, but I don’t know\r\nwhat hole he’ll come out at.”\r\n\r\nColonel McClure had been in consultation with the President one day,\r\nabout two weeks after Sherman’s disappearance, and in this connection\r\nrelated this incident:\r\n\r\n“I was leaving the room, and just as I reached the door the President\r\nturned around, and, with a merry twinkling of the eye, inquired,\r\n‘McClure, wouldn’t you like to hear something from Sherman?’\r\n\r\n“The inquiry electrified me at the instant, as it seemed to imply that\r\nLincoln had some information on the subject. I immediately answered,\r\n‘Yes, most of all, I should like to hear from Sherman.’\r\n\r\n“To this President Lincoln answered, with a hearty laugh: ‘Well, I’ll be\r\nhanged if I wouldn’t myself.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SUMMER THOUGHT.\r\n\r\nAlthough himself a most polished, even a fastidious, gentleman, Senator\r\nSumner never allowed Lincoln’s homely ways to hide his great qualities.\r\nHe gave him a respect and esteem at the start which others accorded only\r\nafter experience. The Senator was most tactful, too, in his dealings\r\nwith Mrs. Lincoln, and soon had a firm footing in the household. That he\r\nwas proud of this, perhaps a little boastful, there is no doubt.\r\n\r\nLincoln himself appreciated this. “Sumner thinks he runs me,” he said,\r\nwith an amused twinkle, one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA USELESS DOG.\r\n\r\nWhen Hood’s army had been scattered into fragments, President Lincoln,\r\nelated by the defeat of what had so long been a menacing force on the\r\nborders of Tennessee was reminded by its collapse of the fate of a\r\nsavage dog belonging to one of his neighbors in the frontier settlements\r\nin which he lived in his youth. “The dog,” he said, “was the terror of\r\nthe neighborhood, and its owner, a churlish and quarrelsome fellow, took\r\npleasure in the brute’s forcible attitude.\r\n\r\n“Finally, all other means having failed to subdue the creature, a man\r\nloaded a lump of meat with a charge of powder, to which was attached a\r\nslow fuse; this was dropped where the dreaded dog would find it, and the\r\nanimal gulped down the tempting bait.\r\n\r\n“There was a dull rumbling, a muffled explosion, and fragments of the\r\ndog were seen flying in every direction. The grieved owner, picking up\r\nthe shattered remains of his cruel favorite, said: ‘He was a good dog,\r\nbut as a dog, his days of usefulness are over.’ Hood’s army was a good\r\narmy,” said Lincoln, by way of comment, “and we were all afraid of it,\r\nbut as an army, its usefulness is gone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE “INFLUENCE” STORY.\r\n\r\nJudge Baldwin, of California, being in Washington, called one day on\r\nGeneral Halleck, then Commander-in-Chief of the Union forces, and,\r\npresuming upon a familiar acquaintance in California a few years since,\r\nsolicited a pass outside of our lines to see a brother in Virginia,\r\nnot thinking that he would meet with a refusal, as both his brother and\r\nhimself were good Union men.\r\n\r\n“We have been deceived too often,” said General Halleck, “and I regret I\r\ncan’t grant it.”\r\n\r\nJudge B. then went to Stanton, and was very briefly disposed of with\r\nthe same result. Finally, he obtained an interview with Mr. Lincoln, and\r\nstated his case.\r\n\r\n“Have you applied to General Halleck?” inquired the President.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and met with a flat refusal,” said Judge B.\r\n\r\n“Then you must see Stanton,” continued the President.\r\n\r\n“I have, and with the same result,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Mr. Lincoln, with a smile, “I can do nothing; for you\r\nmust know that I have very little influence with this Administration,\r\nalthough I hope to have more with the next.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFELT SORRY FOR BOTH.\r\n\r\nMany ladies attended the famous debates between Lincoln and Douglas, and\r\nthey were the most unprejudiced listeners. “I can recall only one fact\r\nof the debates,” says Mrs. William Crotty, of Seneca, Illinois, “that\r\nI felt so sorry for Lincoln while Douglas was speaking, and then to my\r\nsurprise I felt so sorry for Douglas when Lincoln replied.”\r\n\r\nThe disinterested to whom it was an intellectual game, felt the power\r\nand charm of both men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE DID IT COME FROM?\r\n\r\n“What made the deepest impression upon you?” inquired a friend one day,\r\n“when you stood in the presence of the Falls of Niagara, the greatest of\r\nnatural wonders?”\r\n\r\n“The thing that struck me most forcibly when I saw the Falls,” Lincoln\r\nresponded, with characteristic deliberation, “was, where in the world\r\ndid all that water come from?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“LONG ABE” FOUR YEARS LONGER.\r\n\r\nThe second election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency of the United\r\nStates was the reward of his courage and genius bestowed upon him by the\r\npeople of the Union States. General George B. McClellan was his opponent\r\nin 1864 upon the platform that “the War is a failure,” and carried but\r\nthree States--New Jersey, Delaware and Kentucky. The States which did\r\nnot think the War was a failure were those in New England, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, all the Western commonwealths, West Virginia, Tennessee,\r\nLouisiana, Arkansas and the new State of Nevada, admitted into the Union\r\non October 31st. President Lincoln’s popular majority over McClellan,\r\nwho never did much toward making the War a success, was more than four\r\nhundred thousand. Underneath the cartoon reproduced here, from “Harper’s\r\nWeekly” of November 26th, 1864, were the words, “Long Abraham Lincoln a\r\nLittle Longer.”\r\n\r\nBut the beloved President’s time upon earth was not to be much longer,\r\nas he was assassinated just one month and ten days after his second\r\ninauguration. Indeed, the words, “a little longer,” printed below the\r\ncartoon, were strangely prophetic, although not intended to be such.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States had learned to love “Long Abe,” their\r\naffection being of a purely personal nature, in the main. No other Chief\r\nExecutive was regarded as so sincerely the friend of the great mass of\r\nthe inhabitants of the Republic as Lincoln. He was, in truth, one of\r\n“the common people,” having been born among them, and lived as one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s great height made him an easy subject for the cartoonist, and\r\nthey used it in his favor as well as against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ALL SICKER’N YOUR MAN.”\r\n\r\nA Commissioner to the Hawaiian Islands was to be appointed, and eight\r\napplicants had filed their papers, when a delegation from the South\r\nappeared at the White House on behalf of a ninth. Not only was their\r\nman fit--so the delegation urged--but was also in bad health, and a\r\nresidence in that balmy climate would be of great benefit to him.\r\n\r\nThe President was rather impatient that day, and before the members of\r\nthe delegation had fairly started in, suddenly closed the interview with\r\nthis remark:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I am sorry to say that there are eight other applicants for\r\nthat place, and they are all ‘sicker’n’ your man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEASIER TO EMPTY THE POTOMAC.\r\n\r\nAn officer of low volunteer rank persisted in telling and re-telling his\r\ntroubles to the President on a summer afternoon when Lincoln was tired\r\nand careworn.\r\n\r\nAfter listening patiently, he finally turned upon the man, and, looking\r\nwearily out upon the broad Potomac in the distance, said in a peremptory\r\ntone that ended the interview:\r\n\r\n“Now, my man, go away, go away. I cannot meddle in your case. I could as\r\neasily bail out the Potomac River with a teaspoon as attend to all the\r\ndetails of the army.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE WANTED A STEADY HAND.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emancipation Proclamation was taken to Mr. Lincoln by Secretary\r\nSeward, for the President’s signature, Mr. Lincoln took a pen, dipped\r\nit in the ink, moved his hand to the place for the signature, held it\r\na moment, then removed his hand and dropped the pen. After a little\r\nhesitation, he again took up the pen and went through the same movement\r\nas before. Mr. Lincoln then turned to Mr. Seward and said:\r\n\r\n“I have been shaking hands since nine o’clock this morning, and my right\r\narm is almost paralyzed. If my name ever goes into history, it will be\r\nfor this act, and my whole soul is in it. If my hand trembles when I\r\nsign the Proclamation, all who examine the document hereafter will say,\r\n‘He hesitated.’”\r\n\r\nHe then turned to the table, took up the pen again, and slowly, firmly\r\nwrote “Abraham Lincoln,” with which the whole world is now familiar.\r\n\r\nHe then looked up, smiled, and said, “That will do.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN SAW STANTON ABOUT IT.\r\n\r\nMr. Lovejoy, heading a committee of Western men, discussed an important\r\nscheme with the President, and the gentlemen were then directed to\r\nexplain it to Secretary of War Stanton.\r\n\r\nUpon presenting themselves to the Secretary, and showing the President’s\r\norder, the Secretary said: “Did Lincoln give you an order of that kind?”\r\n\r\n“He did, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then he is a d--d fool,” said the angry Secretary.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that the President is a d--d fool?” asked Lovejoy,\r\nin amazement.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, if he gave you such an order as that.”\r\n\r\nThe bewildered Illinoisan betook himself at once to the President and\r\nrelated the result of the conference.\r\n\r\n“Did Stanton say I was a d--d fool?” asked Lincoln at the close of the\r\nrecital.\r\n\r\n“He did, sir, and repeated it.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s pause, and looking up, the President said: “If Stanton\r\nsaid I was a d--d fool, then I must be one, for he is nearly always\r\nright, and generally says what he means. I will slip over and see him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. LINCOLN’S SURPRISE.\r\n\r\nA good story is told of how Mrs. Lincoln made a little surprise for her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nIn the early days it was customary for lawyers to go from one county to\r\nanother on horseback, a journey which often required several weeks.\r\nOn returning from one of these trips, late one night, Mr. Lincoln\r\ndismounted from his horse at the familiar corner and then turned to go\r\ninto the house, but stopped; a perfectly unknown structure was before\r\nhim. Surprised, and thinking there must be some mistake, he went across\r\nthe way and knocked at a neighbor’s door. The family had retired, and so\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n“Who’s there?”\r\n\r\n“Abe Lincoln,” was the reply. “I am looking for my house. I thought it\r\nwas across the way, but when I went away a few weeks ago there was only\r\na one-story house there and now there is a two-story house in its place.\r\nI think I must be lost.”\r\n\r\nThe neighbors then explained that Mrs. Lincoln had added another story\r\nduring his absence. And Mr. Lincoln laughed and went to his remodeled\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMENACE TO THE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe persistence of office-seekers nearly drove President Lincoln wild.\r\nThey slipped in through the half-opened doors of the Executive Mansion;\r\nthey dogged his steps if he walked; they edged their way through the\r\ncrowds and thrust their papers in his hands when he rode; and, taking it\r\nall in all, they well-nigh worried him to death.\r\n\r\nHe once said that if the Government passed through the Rebellion without\r\ndismemberment there was the strongest danger of its falling a prey to\r\nthe rapacity of the office-seeking class.\r\n\r\n“This human struggle and scramble for office, for a way to live without\r\nwork, will finally test the strength of our institutions,” were the\r\nwords he used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTROOPS COULDN’T FLY OVER IT.\r\n\r\nOn April 20th a delegation from Baltimore appeared at the White House\r\nand begged the President that troops for Washington be sent around and\r\nnot through Baltimore.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln replied, laughingly: “If I grant this concession, you\r\nwill be back tomorrow asking that no troops be marched ‘around’ it.”\r\n\r\nThe President was right. That afternoon, and again on Sunday and Monday,\r\ncommittees sought him, protesting that Maryland soil should not be\r\n“polluted” by the feet of soldiers marching against the South.\r\n\r\nThe President had but one reply: “We must have troops, and as they can\r\nneither crawl under Maryland nor fly over it, they must come across it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAT WAS “FORNINST THE GOVERNMENT.”\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General of Canada, with some of his principal officers,\r\nvisited President Lincoln in the summer of 1864.\r\n\r\nThey had been very troublesome in harboring blockade runners, and they\r\nwere said to have carried on a large trade from their ports with the\r\nConfederates. Lincoln treated his guests with great courtesy.\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant interview, the Governor, alluding to the coming\r\nPresidential election said, jokingly, but with a grain of sarcasm: “I\r\nunderstand Mr. President, that everybody votes in this country. If we\r\nremain until November, can we vote?”\r\n\r\n“You remind me,” replied the President, “of a countryman of yours, a\r\ngreen emigrant from Ireland. Pat arrived on election day, and perhaps\r\nwas as eager as your Excellency to vote, and to vote early, and late and\r\noften.\r\n\r\n“So, upon landing at Castle Garden, he hastened to the nearest voting\r\nplace, and as he approached, the judge who received the ballots\r\ninquired, ‘Who do you want to vote for? On which side are you?’ Poor Pat\r\nwas embarrassed; he did not know who were the candidates. He stopped,\r\nscratched his head, then, with the readiness of his countrymen, he said:\r\n\r\n“‘I am forninst the Government, anyhow. Tell me, if your Honor plase:\r\nwhich is the rebellion side, and I’ll tell you haw I want to vote. In\r\nould Ireland, I was always on the rebellion side, and, by Saint Patrick,\r\nI’ll do that same in America.’ Your Excellency,” said Mr. Lincoln,\r\n“would, I should think, not be at all at a loss on which side to vote!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“CAN’T SPARE THIS MAN.”\r\n\r\nOne night, about eleven o’clock, Colonel A. K. McClure, whose intimacy\r\nwith President Lincoln was so great that he could obtain admittance to\r\nthe Executive Mansion at any and all hours, called at the White House to\r\nurge Mr. Lincoln to remove General Grant from command.\r\n\r\nAfter listening patiently for a long time, the President, gathering\r\nhimself up in his chair, said, with the utmost earnestness:\r\n\r\n“I can’t spare this man; he fights!”\r\n\r\nIn relating the particulars of this interview, Colonel McClure said:\r\n\r\n“That was all he said, but I knew that it was enough, and that Grant was\r\nsafe in Lincoln’s hands against his countless hosts of enemies. The only\r\nman in all the nation who had the power to save Grant was Lincoln,\r\nand he had decided to do it. He was not influenced by any personal\r\npartiality for Grant, for they had never met.\r\n\r\n“It was not until after the battle of Shiloh, fought on the 6th and\r\n7th of April, 1862, that Lincoln was placed in a position to exercise a\r\ncontrolling influence in shaping the destiny of Grant. The first reports\r\nfrom the Shiloh battle-field created profound alarm throughout the\r\nentire country, and the wildest exaggerations were spread in a floodtide\r\nof vituperation against Grant.\r\n\r\n“The few of to-day who can recall the inflamed condition of public\r\nsentiment against Grant caused by the disastrous first day’s battle\r\nat Shiloh will remember that he was denounced as incompetent for his\r\ncommand by the public journals of all parties in the North, and with\r\nalmost entire unanimity by Senators and Congressmen, regardless of\r\npolitical affinities.\r\n\r\n“I appealed to Lincoln for his own sake to remove Grant at once, and\r\nin giving my reasons for it I simply voiced the admittedly overwhelming\r\nprotest from the loyal people of the land against Grant’s continuance in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n“I did not forget that Lincoln was the one man who never allowed\r\nhimself to appear as wantonly defying public sentiment. It seemed to\r\nme impossible for him to save Grant without taking a crushing load of\r\ncondemnation upon himself; but Lincoln was wiser than all those\r\naround him, and he not only saved Grant, but he saved him by such\r\nwell-concerted effort that he soon won popular applause from those who\r\nwere most violent in demanding Grant’s dismissal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS TEETH CHATTERED.\r\n\r\nDuring the Lincoln-Douglas joint debates of 1858, the latter accused\r\nLincoln of having, when in Congress, voted against the appropriation\r\nfor supplies to be sent the United States soldiers in Mexico. In reply,\r\nLincoln said: “This is a perversion of the facts. I was opposed to the\r\npolicy of the administration in declaring war against Mexico; but\r\nwhen war was declared I never failed to vote for the support of\r\nany proposition looking to the comfort of our poor fellows who were\r\nmaintaining the dignity of our flag in a war that I thought unnecessary\r\nand unjust.”\r\n\r\nHe gradually became more and more excited; his voice thrilled and his\r\nwhole frame shook. Sitting on the stand was O. B. Ficklin, who had\r\nserved in Congress with Lincoln in 1847. Lincoln reached back, took\r\nFicklin by the coat-collar, back of his neck, and in no gentle manner\r\nlifted him from his seat as if he had been a kitten, and roared:\r\n“Fellow-citizens, here is Ficklin, who was at that time in Congress with\r\nme, and he knows it is a lie.”\r\n\r\nHe shook Ficklin until his teeth chattered. Fearing he would shake\r\nFicklin’s head off, Ward Lamon grasped Lincoln’s hand and broke his\r\ngrip.\r\n\r\nAfter the speaking was over, Ficklin, who had warm personal friendship\r\nwith him, said: “Lincoln, you nearly shook all the Democracy out of me\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“AARON GOT HIS COMMISSION.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was censured for appointing one that had zealously\r\nopposed his second term.\r\n\r\nHe replied: “Well, I suppose Judge E., having been disappointed before,\r\ndid behave pretty ugly, but that wouldn’t make him any less fit for the\r\nplace; and I think I have Scriptural authority for appointing him.\r\n\r\n“You remember when the Lord was on Mount Sinai getting out a commission\r\nfor Aaron, that same Aaron was at the foot of the mountain making a\r\nfalse god for the people to worship. Yet Aaron got his commission, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND THE MINISTERS.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Lincoln’s nomination, at Chicago, Mr. Newton Bateman,\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Illinois, occupied\r\na room adjoining and opening into the Executive Chamber at Springfield.\r\nFrequently this door was open during Mr. Lincoln’s receptions, and\r\nthroughout the seven months or more of his occupation he saw him nearly\r\nevery day. Often, when Mr. Lincoln was tired, he closed the door against\r\nall intruders, and called Mr. Bateman into his room for a quiet talk. On\r\none of these occasions, Mr. Lincoln took up a book containing canvass\r\nof the city of Springfield, in which he lived, showing the candidate\r\nfor whom each citizen had declared it his intention to vote in the\r\napproaching election. Mr. Lincoln’s friends had, doubtless at his own\r\nrequest, placed the result of the canvass in his hands. This was towards\r\nthe close of October, and only a few days before election. Calling Mr.\r\nBateman to a seat by his side, having previously locked all the doors,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n“Let us look over this book; I wish particularly to see how the\r\nministers if Springfield are going to vote.” The leaves were turned, one\r\nby one, and as the names were examined Mr. Lincoln frequently asked if\r\nthis one and that one was not a minister, or an elder, or a member of\r\nsuch and such a church, and sadly expressed his surprise on receiving an\r\naffirmative answer. In that manner he went through the book, and then he\r\nclosed it, and sat silently for some minutes regarding a memorandum in\r\npencil which lay before him. At length he turned to Mr. Bateman, with a\r\nface full of sadness, and said:\r\n\r\n“Here are twenty-three ministers of different denominations, and all\r\nof them are against me but three, and here are a great many prominent\r\nmembers of churches, a very large majority are against me. Mr. Bateman,\r\nI am not a Christian--God knows I would be one--but I have carefully\r\nread the Bible, and I do not so understand this book,” and he drew forth\r\na pocket New Testament.\r\n\r\n“These men well know,” he continued, “that I am for freedom in the\r\nTerritories, freedom everywhere, as free as the Constitution and the\r\nlaws will permit, and that my opponents are for slavery. They know this,\r\nand yet, with this book in their hands, in the light of which human\r\nbondage cannot live a moment, they are going to vote against me; I do\r\nnot understand it at all.”\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Lincoln paused--paused for long minutes, his features\r\nsurcharged with emotion. Then he rose and walked up and down the\r\nreception-room in the effort to retain or regain his self-possession.\r\nStopping at last, he said, with a trembling voice and cheeks wet with\r\ntears:\r\n\r\n“I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice and slavery. I see\r\nthe storm coming, and I know that His hand is in it. If He has a place\r\nand work for me, and I think He has, I believe I am ready. I am nothing,\r\nbut Truth is everything. I know I am right, because I know that liberty\r\nis right, for Christ teaches it, and Christ is God. I have told them\r\nthat a house divided against itself cannot stand; and Christ and Reason\r\nsay the same, and they will find it so.\r\n\r\n“Douglas doesn’t care whether slavery is voted up or down, but God\r\ncares, and humanity cares, and I care; and with God’s help I shall\r\nnot fail. I may not see the end, but it will come, and I shall be\r\nvindicated; and these men will find they have not read their Bible\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nMuch of this was uttered as if he were speaking to himself, and with\r\na sad, earnest solemnity of manner impossible to be described. After a\r\npause he resumed:\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t it seem strange that men can ignore the moral aspect of this\r\ncontest? No revelation could make it plainer to me that slavery or the\r\nGovernment must be destroyed. The future would be something awful, as\r\nI look at it, but for this rock on which I stand” (alluding to the\r\nTestament which he still held in his hand), “especially with the\r\nknowledge of how these ministers are going to vote. It seems as if God\r\nhad borne with this thing (slavery) until the teachers of religion have\r\ncome to defend it from the Bible, and to claim for it a divine character\r\nand sanction; and now the cup of iniquity is full, and the vials of\r\nwrath will be poured out.”\r\n\r\nEverything he said was of a peculiarly deep, tender, and religious tone,\r\nand all was tinged with a touching melancholy. He repeatedly referred to\r\nhis conviction that the day of wrath was at hand, and that he was to be\r\nan actor in the terrible struggle which would issue in the overthrow of\r\nslavery, although he might not live to see the end.\r\n\r\nAfter further reference to a belief in the Divine Providence and the\r\nfact of God in history, the conversation turned upon prayer. He freely\r\nstated his belief in the duty, privilege, and efficacy of prayer, and\r\nintimated, in no unmistakable terms, that he had sought in that way\r\nDivine guidance and favor. The effect of this conversation upon the\r\nmind of Mr. Bateman, a Christian gentleman whom Mr. Lincoln profoundly\r\nrespected, was to convince him that Mr. Lincoln had, in a quiet way,\r\nfound a path to the Christian standpoint--that he had found God,\r\nand rested on the eternal truth of God. As the two men were about to\r\nseparate, Mr. Bateman remarked:\r\n\r\n“I have not supposed that you were accustomed to think so much upon this\r\nclass of subjects; certainly your friends generally are ignorant of the\r\nsentiments you have expressed to me.”\r\n\r\nHe replied quickly: “I know they are, but I think more on these subjects\r\nthan upon all others, and I have done so for years; and I am willing you\r\nshould know it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDTACK BETTER THAN GENERALS.\r\n\r\nSecretary of War Stanton told the President the following story, which\r\ngreatly amused the latter, as he was especially fond of a joke at the\r\nexpense of some high military or civil dignitary.\r\n\r\nStanton had little or no sense of humor.\r\n\r\nWhen Secretary Stanton was making a trip up the Broad River in North\r\nCarolina, in a tugboat, a Federal picket yelled out, “What have you got\r\non board of that tug?”\r\n\r\nThe severe and dignified answer was, “The Secretary of War and\r\nMajor-General Foster.”\r\n\r\nInstantly the picket roared back, “We’ve got Major-Generals enough up\r\nhere. Why don’t you bring us up some hardtack?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOT THE PREACHER.\r\n\r\nA story told by a Cabinet member tended to show how accurately Lincoln\r\ncould calculate political results in advance--a faculty which remained\r\nwith him all his life.\r\n\r\n“A friend, who was a Democrat, had come to him early in the canvass and\r\ntold him he wanted to see him elected, but did not like to vote against\r\nhis party; still he would vote for him, if the contest was to be so\r\nclose that every vote was needed.\r\n\r\n“A short time before the election Lincoln said to him: ‘I have got the\r\npreacher, and I don’t want your vote.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG JOKE ON HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWhen General Halleck was Commander-in-Chief of the Union forces, with\r\nheadquarters at Washington, President Lincoln unconsciously played a big\r\npractical joke upon that dignified officer. The President had spent\r\nthe night at the Soldiers’ Home, and the next morning asked Captain\r\nDerickson, commanding the company of Pennsylvania soldiers, which was\r\nthe Presidential guard at the White House and the Home--wherever the\r\nPresident happened to be--to go to town with him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Derickson told the story in a most entertaining way:\r\n\r\n“When we entered the city, Mr. Lincoln said he would call at General\r\nHalleck’s headquarters and get what news had been received from the\r\narmy during the night. I informed him that General Cullum, chief aid to\r\nGeneral Halleck, was raised in Meadville, and that I knew him when I was\r\na boy.\r\n\r\n“He replied, ‘Then we must see both the gentlemen.’ When the carriage\r\nstopped, he requested me to remain seated, and said he would bring the\r\ngentlemen down to see me, the office being on the second floor. In a\r\nshort time the President came down, followed by the other gentlemen.\r\nWhen he introduced them to me, General Cullum recognized and seemed\r\npleased to see me.\r\n\r\n“In General Halleck I thought I discovered a kind of quizzical look,\r\nas much as to say, ‘Isn’t this rather a big joke to ask the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the army down to the street to be introduced to a\r\ncountry captain?’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORIES BETTER THAN DOCTORS.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, visiting a hospital at Washington, heard an occupant of one\r\nof the beds laughing and talking about the President, who had been there\r\na short time before and gladdened the wounded with some of his stories.\r\nThe soldier seemed in such good spirits that the gentleman inquired:\r\n\r\n“You must be very slightly wounded?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the brave fellow, “very slightly--I have only lost one\r\nleg, and I’d be glad enough to lose the other, if I could hear some more\r\nof ‘Old Abe’s’ stories.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT, BUT EXCITING.\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Wilson, employed in the telegraph office at the War\r\nDepartment, ran over to the White House one day to summon Mr. Lincoln.\r\nHe described the trip back to the War Department in this manner:\r\n\r\n“Calling one of his two younger boys to join him, we then started from\r\nthe White House, between stately trees, along a gravel path which led to\r\nthe rear of the old War Department building. It was a warm day, and Mr.\r\nLincoln wore as part of his costume a faded gray linen duster which hung\r\nloosely around his long gaunt frame; his kindly eye was beaming with\r\ngood nature, and his ever-thoughtful brow was unruffled.\r\n\r\n“We had barely reached the gravel walk before he stooped over, picked up\r\na round smooth pebble, and shooting it off his thumb, challenged us to\r\na game of ‘followings,’ which we accepted. Each in turn tried to hit\r\nthe outlying stone, which was being constantly projected onward by\r\nthe President. The game was short, but exciting; the cheerfulness\r\nof childhood, the ambition of young manhood, and the gravity of the\r\nstatesman were all injected into it.\r\n\r\n“The game was not won until the steps of the War Department were\r\nreached. Every inch of progression was toughly contested, and when the\r\nPresident was declared victor, it was only by a hand span. He appeared\r\nto be as much pleased as if he had won a battle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BULL DIDN’T GET HIS COTTON.\r\n\r\nBecause of the blockade, by the Union fleets, of the Southern cotton\r\nports, England was deprived of her supply of cotton, and scores of\r\nthousands of British operatives were thrown out of employment by the\r\nclosing of the cotton mills at Manchester and other cities in Great\r\nBritain. England (John Bull) felt so badly about this that the British\r\nwanted to go to war on account of it, but when the United States eagle\r\nruffled up its wings the English thought over the business and concluded\r\nnot to fight.\r\n\r\n“Harper’s Weekly” of May 16th, 1863, contained the cartoon we reproduce,\r\nwhich shows John Bull as manifesting much anxiety regarding the cotton\r\nhe had bought from the Southern planters, but which the latter could not\r\ndeliver. Beneath the cartoon is this bit of dialogue between John\r\nBull and President Lincoln: MR. BULL (confiding creature): “Hi want my\r\ncotton, bought at fi’pence a pound.”\r\n\r\nMR. LINCOLN: “Don’t know anything about it, my dear sir. Your friends,\r\nthe rebels, are burning all the cotton they can find, and I confiscate\r\nthe rest. Good-morning, John!”\r\n\r\nAs President Lincoln has a big fifteen-inch gun at his side, the black\r\nmuzzle of which is pressed tightly against Mr. Bull’s waistcoat, the\r\nPresident, to all appearances, has the best of the argument “by a long\r\nshot.” Anyhow, Mr. Bull had nothing more to say, but gave the cotton\r\nmatter up as a bad piece of business, and pocketed the loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTICK TO AMERICAN PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln’s first conclusion (that Mason and Slidell should be\r\nreleased) was the real ground on which the Administration submitted. “We\r\nmust stick to American principles concerning the rights of neutrals.” It\r\nwas to many, as Secretary of the Treasury Chase declared it was to him,\r\n“gall and wormwood.” James Russell Lowell’s verse expressed best the\r\npopular feeling:\r\n\r\nWe give the critters back, John, Cos Abram thought ‘twas right; It\r\nwarn’t your bullyin’ clack, John, Provokin’ us to fight.\r\n\r\nThe decision raised Mr. Lincoln immeasurably in the view of thoughtful\r\nmen, especially in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSED “RUDE TACT.”\r\n\r\nGeneral John C. Fremont, with headquarters at St. Louis, astonished the\r\ncountry by issuing a proclamation declaring, among other things, that\r\nthe property, real and personal, of all the persons in the State of\r\nMissouri who should take up arms against the United States, or who\r\nshould be directly proved to have taken an active part with its enemies\r\nin the field, would be confiscated to public use and their slaves, if\r\nthey had any, declared freemen.\r\n\r\nThe President was dismayed; he modified that part of the proclamation\r\nreferring to slaves, and finally replaced Fremont with General Hunter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fremont (daughter of Senator T. H. Benton), her husband’s real\r\nchief of staff, flew to Washington and sought Mr. Lincoln. It was\r\nmidnight, but the President gave her an audience. Without waiting for an\r\nexplanation, she violently charged him with sending an enemy to Missouri\r\nto look into Fremont’s case, and threatening that if Fremont desired to\r\nhe could set up a government for himself.\r\n\r\n“I had to exercise all the rude tact I have to avoid quarreling with\r\nher,” said Mr. Lincoln afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” ON A WOODPILE.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s attempt to make a lawyer of himself under adverse and\r\nunpromising circumstances--he was a bare-footed farm-hand--excited\r\ncomment. And it was not to be wondered. One old man, who was yet alive\r\nas late as 1901, had often employed Lincoln to do farm work for him, and\r\nwas surprised to find him one day sitting barefoot on the summit of a\r\nwoodpile and attentively reading a book.\r\n\r\n“This being an unusual thing for farm-hands in that early day to do,”\r\n said the old man, when relating the story, “I asked him what he was\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n“‘I’m not reading,’ he answered. ‘I’m studying.’\r\n\r\n“‘Studying what?’ I inquired.\r\n\r\n“‘Law, sir,’ was the emphatic response.\r\n\r\n“It was really too much for me, as I looked at him sitting there proud\r\nas Cicero. ‘Great God Almighty!’ I exclaimed, and passed on.” Lincoln\r\nmerely laughed and resumed his “studies.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING DOWN A DANDY.\r\n\r\nIn a political campaign, Lincoln once replied to Colonel Richard Taylor,\r\na self-conceited, dandified man, who wore a gold chain and ruffled\r\nshirt. His party at that time was posing as the hard-working bone and\r\nsinew of the land, while the Whigs were stigmatized as aristocrats,\r\nruffled-shirt gentry. Taylor making a sweeping gesture, his overcoat\r\nbecame torn open, displaying his finery. Lincoln in reply said, laying\r\nhis hand on his jeans-clad breast:\r\n\r\n“Here is your aristocrat, one of your silk-stocking gentry, at your\r\nservice.” Then, spreading out his hands, bronzed and gaunt with toil:\r\n“Here is your rag-basin with lily-white hands. Yes, I suppose, according\r\nto my friend Taylor, I am a bloated aristocrat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN OLD ABE GOT MAD.\r\n\r\nSoon after hostilities broke out between the North and South, Congress\r\nappointed a Committee on the Conduct of the War. This committee beset\r\nMr. Lincoln and urged all sorts of measures. Its members were aggressive\r\nand patriotic, and one thing they determined upon was that the Army of\r\nthe Potomac should move. But it was not until March that they became\r\nconvinced that anything would be done.\r\n\r\nOne day early in that month, Senator Chandler, of Michigan, a member of\r\nthe committee, met George W. Julian. He was in high glee. “‘Old’ Abe is\r\nmad,” said Julian, “and the War will now go on.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED TO “BORROW” THE ARMY.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the periods when things were at a standstill, the\r\nWashington authorities, being unable to force General McClellan to\r\nassume an aggressive attitude, President Lincoln went to the general’s\r\nheadquarters to have a talk with him, but for some reason he was unable\r\nto get an audience.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln returned to the White House much disturbed at his failure\r\nto see the commander of the Union forces, and immediately sent for two\r\ngeneral officers, to have a consultation. On their arrival, he told\r\nthem he must have some one to talk to about the situation, and as he\r\nhad failed to see General McClellan, he wished their views as to the\r\npossibility or probability of commencing active operations with the Army\r\nof the Potomac.\r\n\r\n“Something’s got to be done,” said the President, emphatically, “and\r\ndone right away, or the bottom will fall out of the whole thing. Now, if\r\nMcClellan doesn’t want to use the army for awhile, I’d like to borrow it\r\nfrom him and see if I can’t do something or other with it.\r\n\r\n“If McClellan can’t fish, he ought at least to be cutting bait at a time\r\nlike this.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG “SUCKER” VISITORS.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Lincoln’s nomination for the Presidency, the Executive\r\nChamber, a large, fine room in the State House at Springfield, was set\r\napart for him, where he met the public until after his election.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the nature of many of his calls, the following\r\nincident was related by Mr. Holland, an eye-witness: “Mr. Lincoln being\r\nin conversation with a gentleman one day, two raw, plainly-dressed young\r\n‘Suckers’ entered the room, and bashfully lingered near the door. As\r\nsoon as he observed them, and saw their embarrassment, he rose and\r\nwalked to them, saying: ‘How do you do, my good fellows? What can I do\r\nfor you? Will you sit down?’ The spokesman of the pair, the shorter of\r\nthe two, declined to sit, and explained the object of the call thus:\r\nHe had had a talk about the relative height of Mr. Lincoln and his\r\ncompanion, and had asserted his belief that they were of exactly the\r\nsame height. He had come in to verify his judgment. Mr. Lincoln smiled,\r\nwent and got his cane, and, placing the end of it upon the wall, said”\r\n ‘Here, young man, come under here.’ “The young man came under the\r\ncane as Mr. Lincoln held it, and when it was perfectly adjusted to his\r\nheight, Mr. Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n“‘Now, come out, and hold the cane.’\r\n\r\n“This he did, while Mr. Lincoln stood under. Rubbing his head back and\r\nforth to see that it worked easily under the measurement, he stepped\r\nout, and declared to the sagacious fellow who was curiously looking on,\r\nthat he had guessed with remarkable accuracy--that he and the young man\r\nwere exactly the same height. Then he shook hands with them and sent\r\nthem on their way. Mr. Lincoln would just as soon have thought of\r\ncutting off his right hand as he would have thought of turning those\r\nboys away with the impression that they had in any way insulted his\r\ndignity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“AND YOU DON’T WEAR HOOPSKIRTS.”\r\n\r\nAn Ohio Senator had an appointment with President Lincoln at six\r\no’clock, and as he entered the vestibule of the White House his\r\nattention was attracted toward a poorly clad young woman, who was\r\nviolently sobbing. He asked her the cause of her distress. She said she\r\nhad been ordered away by the servants, after vainly waiting many hours\r\nto see the President about her only brother, who had been condemned to\r\ndeath. Her story was this:\r\n\r\nShe and her brother were foreigners, and orphans. They had been in this\r\ncountry several years. Her brother enlisted in the army, but, through\r\nbad influences, was induced to desert. He was captured, tried and\r\nsentenced to be shot--the old story.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl had obtained the signatures of some persons who had\r\nformerly known him, to a petition for a pardon, and alone had come\r\nto Washington to lay the case before the President. Thronged as the\r\nwaiting-rooms always were, she had passed the long hours of two days\r\ntrying in vain to get an audience, and had at length been ordered away.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman’s feelings were touched. He said to her that he had come\r\nto see the President, but did not know as he should succeed. He told\r\nher, however, to follow him upstairs, and he would see what could be\r\ndone for her.\r\n\r\nJust before reaching the door, Mr. Lincoln came out, and, meeting his\r\nfriend, said good-humoredly, “Are you not ahead of time?” The gentleman\r\nshowed him his watch, with the hand upon the hour of six.\r\n\r\n“Well,” returned Mr. Lincoln, “I have been so busy to-day that I\r\nhave not had time to get a lunch. Go in and sit down; I will be back\r\ndirectly.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman made the young woman accompany him into the office, and\r\nwhen they were seated, said to her: “Now, my good girl, I want you to\r\nmuster all the courage you have in the world. When the President comes\r\nback, he will sit down in that armchair. I shall get up to speak to him,\r\nand as I do so you must force yourself between us, and insist upon his\r\nexamination of your papers, telling him it is a case of life and death,\r\nand admits of no delay.” These instructions were carried out to the\r\nletter. Mr. Lincoln was at first somewhat surprised at the apparent\r\nforwardness of the young woman, but observing her distressed appearance,\r\nhe ceased conversation with his friend, and commenced an examination of\r\nthe document she had placed in his hands.\r\n\r\nGlancing from it to the face of the petitioner, whose tears had broken\r\nforth afresh, he studied its expression for a moment, and then his eye\r\nfell upon her scanty but neat dress. Instantly his face lighted up.\r\n\r\n“My poor girl,” said he, “you have come here with no Governor, or\r\nSenator, or member of Congress to plead your cause. You seem honest and\r\ntruthful; and you don’t wear hoopskirts--and I will be whipped but I\r\nwill pardon your brother.” And he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN’S SENTINELS.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln’s favorite son, Tad, having been sportively\r\ncommissioned a lieutenant in the United States Army by Secretary\r\nStanton, procured several muskets and drilled the men-servants of the\r\nhouse in the manual of arms without attracting the attention of his\r\nfather. And one night, to his consternation, he put them all on duty,\r\nand relieved the regular sentries, who, seeing the lad in full uniform,\r\nor perhaps appreciating the joke, gladly went to their quarters. His\r\nbrother objected; but Tad insisted upon his rights as an officer. The\r\nPresident laughed but declined to interfere, but when the lad had lost\r\nhis little authority in his boyish sleep, the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nArmy and Navy of the United States went down and personally discharged\r\nthe sentries his son had put on the post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS HELD LINCOLN’S HAT.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln delivered his first inaugural he was introduced by his\r\nfriend, United States Senator E. D. Baker, of Oregon. He carried a cane\r\nand a little roll--the manuscript of his inaugural address. There was\r\nmoment’s pause after the introduction, as he vainly looked for a spot\r\nwhere he might place his high silk hat.\r\n\r\nStephen A. Douglas, the political antagonist of his whole public life,\r\nthe man who had pressed him hardest in the campaign of 1860, was seated\r\njust behind him. Douglas stepped forward quickly, and took the hat which\r\nMr. Lincoln held helplessly in his hand.\r\n\r\n“If I can’t be President,” Douglas whispered smilingly to Mrs. Brown,\r\na cousin of Mrs. Lincoln and a member of the President’s party, “I at\r\nleast can hold his hat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEAD MAN SPOKE.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln once said in a speech: “Fellow-citizens, my friend, Mr.\r\nDouglas, made the startling announcement to-day that the Whigs are all\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n“If that be so, fellow-citizens, you will now experience the novelty of\r\nhearing a speech from a dead man; and I suppose you might properly say,\r\nin the language of the old hymn:\r\n\r\n“‘Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY SNAILS NOT SPEEDY.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln--as he himself put it in conversation one day with a\r\nfriend--“fairly ached” for his generals to “get down to business.” These\r\nslow generals he termed “snails.”\r\n\r\nGrant, Sherman and Sheridan were his favorites, for they were\r\naggressive. They did not wait for the enemy to attack. Too many of the\r\nothers were “lingerers,” as Lincoln called them. They were magnificent\r\nin defense, and stubborn and brave, but their names figured too much on\r\nthe “waiting list.”\r\n\r\nThe greatest fault Lincoln found with so many of the commanders on the\r\nUnion side was their unwillingness to move until everything was exactly\r\nto their liking.\r\n\r\nLincoln could not understand why these leaders of Northern armies\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTRAN THE JACK-RABBIT.\r\n\r\nWhen the Union forces were routed in the first battle of Bull Run, there\r\nwere many civilians present, who had gone out from Washington to witness\r\nthe battle. Among the number were several Congressmen. One of these was\r\na tall, long-legged fellow, who wore a long-tailed coat and a high plug\r\nhat. When the retreat began, this Congressman was in the lead of the\r\nentire crowd fleeing toward Washington. He outran all the rest, and was\r\nthe first man to arrive in the city. No person ever made such good use\r\nof long legs as this Congressman. His immense stride carried him yards\r\nat every bound. He went over ditches and gullies at a single leap, and\r\ncleared a six-foot fence with a foot to spare. As he went over the fence\r\nhis plug hat blew off, but he did not pause. With his long coat-tails\r\nflying in the wind, he continued straight ahead for Washington.\r\n\r\nMany of those behind him were scared almost to death, but the flying\r\nCongressman was such a comical figure that they had to laugh in spite of\r\ntheir terror.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln enjoyed the description of how this Congressman led the race\r\nfrom Bull’s Run, and laughed at it heartily.\r\n\r\n“I never knew but one fellow who could run like that,” he said, “and\r\nhe was a young man out in Illinois. He had been sparking a girl, much\r\nagainst the wishes of her father. In fact, the old man took such a\r\ndislike to him that he threatened to shoot him if he ever caught him\r\naround his premises again.\r\n\r\n“One evening the young man learned that the girl’s father had gone\r\nto the city, and he ventured out to the house. He was sitting in the\r\nparlor, with his arm around Betsy’s waist, when he suddenly spied the\r\nold man coming around the corner of the house with a shotgun. Leaping\r\nthrough a window into the garden, he started down a path at the top\r\nof his speed. He was a long-legged fellow, and could run like greased\r\nlightning. Just then a jack-rabbit jumped up in the path in front of\r\nhim. In about two leaps he overtook the rabbit. Giving it a kick that\r\nsent it high in the air, he exclaimed: ‘Git out of the road, gosh dern\r\nyou, and let somebody run that knows how.’\r\n\r\n“I reckon,” said Mr. Lincoln, “that the long-legged Congressman, when he\r\nsaw the rebel muskets, must have felt a good deal like that young fellow\r\ndid when he saw the old man’s shot-gun.”\r\n\r\n“FOOLING” THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nLincoln was a strong believer in the virtue of dealing honestly with the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“If you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow-citizens,” he said\r\nto a caller at the White House, “you can never regain their respect and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n“It is true that you may fool all the people some of the time; you can\r\neven fool some of the people all the time; but you can’t fool all of the\r\npeople all the time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE, YOU CAN’T PLAY THAT ON ME.”\r\n\r\nThe night President-elect Lincoln arrived at Washington, one man was\r\nobserved watching Lincoln very closely as he walked out of the railroad\r\nstation. Standing a little to one side, the man looked very sharply at\r\nLincoln, and, as the latter passed, seized hold of his hand, and said in\r\na loud tone of voice, “Abe, you can’t play that on me!”\r\n\r\nWard Lamon and the others with Lincoln were instantly alarmed, and would\r\nhave struck the stranger had not Lincoln hastily said, “Don’t strike\r\nhim! It is Washburne. Don’t you know him?”\r\n\r\nMr. Seward had given Congressman Washburne a hint of the time the train\r\nwould arrive, and he had the right to be at the station when the\r\ntrain steamed in, but his indiscreet manner of loudly addressing the\r\nPresident-elect might have led to serious consequences to the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS “BROAD” STORIES.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rose Linder Wilkinson, who often accompanied her father, Judge\r\nLinder, in the days when he rode circuit with Mr. Lincoln, tells the\r\nfollowing story:\r\n\r\n“At night, as a rule, the lawyers spent awhile in the parlor, and\r\npermitted the women who happened to be along to sit with them. But after\r\nhalf an hour or so we would notice it was time for us to leave them. I\r\nremember traveling the circuit one season when the young wife of one of\r\nthe lawyers was with him. The place was so crowded that she and I were\r\nmade to sleep together. When the time came for banishing us from the\r\nparlor, we went up to our room and sat there till bed-time, listening\r\nto the roars that followed each ether swiftly while those lawyers\r\ndown-stairs told stories and laughed till the rafters rang.\r\n\r\n“In the morning Mr. Lincoln said to me: ‘Rose, did we disturb your sleep\r\nlast night?’ I answered, ‘No, I had no sleep’--which was not entirely\r\ntrue but the retort amused him. Then the young lawyer’s wife complained\r\nto him that we were not fairly used. We came along with them, young\r\nwomen, and when they were having the best time we were sent away like\r\nchildren to go to bed in the dark.\r\n\r\n“‘But, Madame,’ said Mr. Lincoln, ‘you would not enjoy the things we\r\nlaugh at.’ And then he entered into a discussion on what have been\r\ntermed his ‘broad’ stories. He deplored the fact that men seemed to\r\nremember them longer and with less effort than any others.\r\n\r\n“My father said: ‘But, Lincoln, I don’t remember the “broad” part of\r\nyour stories so much as I do the moral that is in them,’ and it was a\r\nthing in which they were all agreed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSORRY FOR THE HORSES.\r\n\r\nWhen President Lincoln heard of the Confederate raid at Fairfax, in\r\nwhich a brigadier-general and a number of valuable horses were captured,\r\nhe gravely observed:\r\n\r\n“Well, I am sorry for the horses.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry for the horses, Mr. President!” exclaimed the Secretary of\r\nWar, raising his spectacles and throwing himself back in his chair in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Mr., Lincoln, “I can make a brigadier-general in five\r\nminutes, but it is not easy to replace a hundred and ten horses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILD REBUKE TO A DOCTOR.\r\n\r\nDr. Jerome Walker, of Brooklyn, told how Mr. Lincoln once administered\r\nto him a mild rebuke. The doctor was showing Mr. Lincoln through the\r\nhospital at City Point.\r\n\r\n“Finally, after visiting the wards occupied by our invalid and\r\nconvalescing soldiers,” said Dr. Walker, “we came to three wards\r\noccupied by sick and wounded Southern prisoners. With a feeling of\r\npatriotic duty, I said: ‘Mr. President, you won’t want to go in there;\r\nthey are only rebels.’\r\n\r\n“I will never forget how he stopped and gently laid his large hand upon\r\nmy shoulder and quietly answered, ‘You mean Confederates!’ And I have\r\nmeant Confederates ever since.\r\n\r\n“There was nothing left for me to do after the President’s remark but to\r\ngo with him through these three wards; and I could not see but that he\r\nwas just as kind, his hand-shakings just as hearty, his interest just as\r\nreal for the welfare of the men, as when he was among our own soldiers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD MOLASSES WAS SWIFTER.\r\n\r\n“Old Pap,” as the soldiers called General George H. Thomas, was\r\naggravatingly slow at a time when the President wanted him to “get\r\na move on”; in fact, the gallant “Rock of Chickamauga” was evidently\r\nentered in a snail-race.\r\n\r\n“Some of my generals are so slow,” regretfully remarked Lincoln one day,\r\n“that molasses in the coldest days of winter is a race horse compared to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“They’re brave enough, but somehow or other they get fastened in a fence\r\ncorner, and can’t figure their way out.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN CALLS MEDILL A COWARD.\r\n\r\nJoseph Medill, for many years editor of the Chicago Tribune, not long\r\nbefore his death, told the following story regarding the “talking to”\r\n President Lincoln gave himself and two other Chicago gentlemen who went\r\nto Washington to see about reducing Chicago’s quota of troops after the\r\ncall for extra men was made by the President in 1864:\r\n\r\n“In 1864, when the call for extra troops came, Chicago revolted. She had\r\nalready sent 22,000 troops up to that time, and was drained. When the\r\ncall came there were no young men to go, and no aliens except what were\r\nbought. The citizens held a mass meeting and appointed three persons, of\r\nwhom I was one, to go to Washington and ask Stanton to give Cook County\r\na new enrollment. On reaching Washington, we went to Stanton with our\r\nstatement. He refused entirely to give us the desired aid. Then we went\r\nto Lincoln. ‘I cannot do it,’ he said, ‘but I will go with you to the\r\nWar Department, and Stanton and I will hear both sides.’\r\n\r\n“So we all went over to the War Department together. Stanton and General\r\nFrye were there, and they, of course, contended that the quota should\r\nnot be changed. The argument went on for some time, and was finally\r\nreferred to Lincoln, who had been sitting silently listening.\r\n\r\n“I shall never forget how he suddenly lifted his head and turned on us a\r\nblack and frowning face.\r\n\r\n“‘Gentlemen,’ he said, in a voice full of bitterness, ‘after Boston,\r\nChicago has been the chief instrument in bringing war on this country.\r\nThe Northwest has opposed the South as New England has opposed the\r\nSouth. It is you who are largely responsible for making blood flow as it\r\nhas.\r\n\r\n“‘You called for war until we had it. You called for Emancipation, and\r\nI have given it to you. Whatever you have asked, you have had. Now you\r\ncome here begging to be let off from the call for men, which I have\r\nmade to carry out the war which you demanded. You ought to be ashamed of\r\nyourselves. I have a right to expect better things of you.\r\n\r\n“‘Go home and raise your six thousand extra men. And you, Medill, you\r\nare acting like a coward. You and your Tribune have had more influence\r\nthan any paper in the Northwest in making this war. You can influence\r\ngreat masses, and yet you cry to be spared at a moment when your cause\r\nis suffering. Go home and send us those men!’\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t say anything. It was the first time I ever was whipped, and\r\nI didn’t have an answer. We all got up and went out, and when the door\r\nclosed one of my colleagues said:\r\n\r\n“‘Well, gentlemen, the old man is right. We ought to be ashamed of\r\nourselves. Let us never say anything about this, but go home and raise\r\nthe men.’\r\n\r\n“And we did--six thousand men--making twenty-eight thousand in the War\r\nfrom a city of one hundred and fifty-six thousand. But there might have\r\nbeen crape on every door, almost, in Chicago, for every family had lost\r\na son or a husband. I lost two brothers. It was hard for the mothers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY DIDN’T BUILD IT.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 a delegation of New York millionaires waited upon President\r\nLincoln to request that he furnish a gunboat for the protection of New\r\nYork harbor.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, after listening patiently, said: “Gentlemen, the credit of\r\nthe Government is at a very low ebb; greenbacks are not worth more than\r\nforty or fifty cents on the dollar; it is impossible for me, in the\r\npresent condition of things, to furnish you a gunboat, and, in this\r\ncondition of things, if I was worth half as much as you, gentlemen, are\r\nrepresented to be, and as badly frightened as you seem to be, I would\r\nbuild a gunboat and give it to the Government.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANTON’S ABUSE OF LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln’s sense of duty to the country, together with his keen\r\njudgment of men, often led to the appointment of persons unfriendly to\r\nhim. Some of these appointees were, as well, not loyal to the National\r\nGovernment, for that matter.\r\n\r\nRegarding Secretary of War Stanton’s attitude toward Lincoln, Colonel A.\r\nK. McClure, who was very close to President Lincoln, said:\r\n\r\n“After Stanton’s retirement from the Buchanan Cabinet when Lincoln\r\nwas inaugurated, he maintained the closest confidential relations with\r\nBuchanan, and wrote him many letters expressing the utmost contempt for\r\nLincoln, the Cabinet, the Republican Congress, and the general policy of\r\nthe Administration.\r\n\r\n“These letters speak freely of the ‘painful imbecility of Lincoln,’\r\nof the ‘venality and corruption’ which ran riot in the government, and\r\nexpressed the belief that no better condition of things was possible\r\n‘until Jeff Davis turns out the whole concern.’\r\n\r\n“He was firmly impressed for some weeks after the battle of Bull Run\r\nthat the government was utterly overthrown, as he repeatedly refers to\r\nthe coming of Davis into the National Capital.\r\n\r\n“In one letter he says that ‘in less than thirty days Davis will be in\r\npossession of Washington;’ and it is an open secret that Stanton advised\r\nthe revolutionary overthrow of the Lincoln government, to be replaced by\r\nGeneral McClellan as military dictator. These letters, bad as they are,\r\nare not the worst letters written by Stanton to Buchanan. Some of\r\nthem were so violent in their expressions against Lincoln and the\r\nadministration that they have been charitably withheld from the\r\npublic, but they remain in the possession of the surviving relatives of\r\nPresident Buchanan.\r\n\r\n“Of course, Lincoln had no knowledge of the bitterness exhibited by\r\nStanton to himself personally and to his administration, but if he had\r\nknown the worst that Stanton ever said or wrote about him, I doubt\r\nnot that he would have called him to the Cabinet in January, 1862. The\r\ndisasters the army suffered made Lincoln forgetful of everything but the\r\nsingle duty of suppressing the rebellion.\r\n\r\n“Lincoln was not long in discovering that in his new Secretary of War he\r\nhad an invaluable but most troublesome Cabinet officer, but he saw\r\nonly the great and good offices that Stanton was performing for the\r\nimperilled Republic.\r\n\r\n“Confidence was restored in financial circles by the appointment of\r\nStanton, and his name as War Minister did more to strengthen the faith\r\nof the people in the government credit than would have been probable\r\nfrom the appointment of any other man of that day.\r\n\r\n“He was a terror to all the hordes of jobbers and speculators and\r\ncamp-followers whose appetites had been whetted by a great war, and he\r\nenforced the strictest discipline throughout our armies.\r\n\r\n“He was seldom capable of being civil to any officer away from the army\r\non leave of absence unless he had been summoned by the government for\r\nconference or special duty, and he issued the strictest orders from time\r\nto time to drive the throng of military idlers from the capital and\r\nkeep them at their posts. He was stern to savagery in his enforcement of\r\nmilitary law. The wearied sentinel who slept at his post found no mercy\r\nin the heart of Stanton, and many times did Lincoln’s humanity overrule\r\nhis fiery minister.\r\n\r\n“Any neglect of military duty was sure of the swiftest punishment, and\r\nseldom did he make even just allowance for inevitable military disaster.\r\nHe had profound, unfaltering faith in the Union cause, and, above all,\r\nhe had unfaltering faith in himself.\r\n\r\n“He believed that he was in all things except in name Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the armies and the navy of the nation, and it was with unconcealed\r\nreluctance that he at times deferred to the authority of the President.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO AND THE CROCODILE.\r\n\r\nIn one of his political speeches, Judge Douglas made use of the\r\nfollowing figure of speech: “As between the crocodile and the negro,\r\nI take the side of the negro; but as between the negro and the white\r\nman--I would go for the white man every time.”\r\n\r\nLincoln, at home, noted that; and afterwards, when he had occasion\r\nto refer to the remark, he said: “I believe that this is a sort of\r\nproposition in proportion, which may be stated thus: ‘As the negro is\r\nto the white man, so is the crocodile to the negro; and as the negro may\r\nrightfully treat the crocodile as a beast or reptile, so the white man\r\nmay rightfully treat the negro as a beast or reptile.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN WAS READY TO FIGHT.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, Colonel Baker was speaking in a court-house, which had\r\nbeen a storehouse, and, on making some remarks that were offensive to\r\ncertain political rowdies in the crowd, they cried: “Take him off the\r\nstand!”\r\n\r\nImmediate confusion followed, and there was an attempt to carry the\r\ndemand into execution. Directly over the speaker’s head was an old\r\nskylight, at which it appeared Mr. Lincoln had been listening to the\r\nspeech. In an instant, Mr. Lincoln’s feet came through the skylight,\r\nfollowed by his tall and sinewy frame, and he was standing by Colonel\r\nBaker’s side. He raised his hand and the assembly subsided into silence.\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Lincoln, “let us not disgrace the age and country\r\nin which we live. This is a land where freedom of speech is guaranteed.\r\nMr. Baker has a right to speak, and ought to be permitted to do so. I am\r\nhere to protect him, and no man shall take him from this stand if I can\r\nprevent it.” The suddenness of his appearance, his perfect calmness and\r\nfairness, and the knowledge that he would do what he had promised to do,\r\nquieted all disturbance, and the speaker concluded his remarks without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT WAS UP-HILL WORK.\r\n\r\nTwo young men called on the President from Springfield, Illinois.\r\nLincoln shook hands with them, and asked about the crops, the weather,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFinally one of the young men said, “Mother is not well, and she sent me\r\nup to inquire of you how the suit about the Wells property is getting\r\non.”\r\n\r\nLincoln, in the same even tone with which he had asked the question,\r\nsaid: “Give my best wishes and respects to your mother, and tell her I\r\nhave so many outside matters to attend to now that I have put that case,\r\nand others, in the hands of a lawyer friend of mine, and if you will\r\ncall on him (giving name and address) he will give you the information\r\nyou want.”\r\n\r\nAfter they had gone, a friend, who was present, said: “Mr. Lincoln, you\r\ndid not seem to know the young men?”\r\n\r\nHe laughed and replied: “No, I had never seen them before, and I had to\r\nbeat around the bush until I found who they were. It was up-hill work,\r\nbut I topped it at last.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEE’S SLIM ANIMAL.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln wrote to General Hooker on June 5, 1863, warning\r\nHooker not to run any risk of being entangled on the Rappahannock “like\r\nan ox jumped half over a fence and liable to be torn by dogs, front and\r\nrear, without a fair chance to give one way or kick the other.” On the\r\n10th he warned Hooker not to go south of the Rappahannock upon Lee’s\r\nmoving north of it. “I think Lee’s army and not Richmond is your true\r\nobjective power. If he comes toward the upper Potomac, follow on his\r\nflank, and on the inside track, shortening your lines while he lengthens\r\nhis. Fight him, too, when opportunity offers. If he stay where he is,\r\nfret him, and fret him.”\r\n\r\nOn the 14th again he says: “So far as we can make out here, the enemy\r\nhave Milroy surrounded at Winchester, and Tyler at Martinsburg. If they\r\ncould hold out for a few days, could you help them? If the head of Lee’s\r\narmy is at Martinsburg, and the tail of it on the flank road between\r\nFredericksburg and Chancellorsville, the animal must be very slim\r\nsomewhere; could you not break him?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MRS. NORTH AND HER ATTORNEY.”\r\n\r\nIn the issue of London “Punch” of September 24th, 1864, President\r\nLincoln is pictured as sitting at a table in his law office, while in a\r\nchair to his right is a client, Mrs. North. The latter is a fine client\r\nfor any attorney to have on his list, being wealthy and liberal, but as\r\nthe lady is giving her counsel, who has represented her in a legal way\r\nfor four years, notice that she proposes to put her legal business in\r\nthe hands of another lawyer, the dejected look upon the face of Attorney\r\nLincoln is easily accounted for. “Punch” puts these words in the lady’s\r\nmouth:\r\n\r\nMRS. NORTH: “You see, Mr. Lincoln, we have failed utterly in our course\r\nof action; I want peace, and so, if you cannot effect an amicable\r\narrangement, I must put the case into other hands.”\r\n\r\nIn this cartoon, “Punch” merely reflected the idea, or sentiment,\r\ncurrent in England in 1864, that the North was much dissatisfied with\r\nthe War policy of President Lincoln; and would surely elect General\r\nMcClellan to succeed the Westerner in the White House. At the election\r\nMcClellan carried but one Northern State--New Jersey, where he was\r\nborn--President Lincoln sweeping the country like a prairie fire.\r\n\r\n“Punch” had evidently been deceived by some bold, bad man, who wanted a\r\nlittle spending money, and sold the prediction to the funny journal with\r\na certificate of character attached, written by--possibly--a member of\r\nthe Horse Marines. “Punch,” was very much disgusted to find that its\r\ncredulity and faith in mankind had been so imposed upon, especially when\r\nthe election returns showed that “the-War-is-a-failure” candidate ran\r\nso slowly that Lincoln passed him as easily as though the Democratic\r\nnominee was tied to a post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSATISFACTION TO THE SOUL.\r\n\r\nIn the far-away days when “Abe” went to school in Indiana, they had\r\nexercises, exhibitions and speaking-meetings in the schoolhouse or the\r\nchurch, and “Abe” was the “star.” His father was a Democrat, and at that\r\ntime “Abe” agreed with his parent. He would frequently make political\r\nand other speeches to the boys and explain tangled questions.\r\n\r\nBooneville was the county seat of Warrick county, situated about fifteen\r\nmiles from Gentryville. Thither “Abe” walked to be present at the\r\nsittings of the court, and listened attentively to the trials and the\r\nspeeches of the lawyers.\r\n\r\nOne of the trials was that of a murderer. He was defended by Mr.\r\nJohn Breckinridge, and at the conclusion of his speech “Abe” was so\r\nenthusiastic that he ventured to compliment him. Breckinridge looked at\r\nthe shabby boy, thanked him, and passed on his way.\r\n\r\nMany years afterwards, in 1862, Breckinridge called on the President,\r\nand he was told, “It was the best speech that I, up to that time, had\r\never heard. If I could, as I then thought, make as good a speech as\r\nthat, my soul would be satisfied.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHDREW THE COLT.\r\n\r\nMr. Alcott, of Elgin, Ill., tells of seeing Mr. Lincoln coming away from\r\nchurch unusually early one Sunday morning. “The sermon could not have\r\nbeen more than half way through,” says Mr. Alcott. “‘Tad’ was slung\r\nacross his left arm like a pair of saddlebags, and Mr. Lincoln was\r\nstriding along with long, deliberate steps toward his home. On one of\r\nthe street corners he encountered a group of his fellow-townsmen. Mr.\r\nLincoln anticipated the question which was about to be put by the group,\r\nand, taking his figure of speech from practices with which they were\r\nonly too familiar, said: ‘Gentlemen, I entered this colt, but he kicked\r\naround so I had to withdraw him.”’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“TAD” GOT HIS DOLLAR.\r\n\r\nNo matter who was with the President, or how intently absorbed, his\r\nlittle son “Tad” was always welcome. He almost always accompanied his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nOnce, on the way to Fortress Monroe, he became very troublesome.\r\nThe President was much engaged in conversation with the party who\r\naccompanied him, and he at length said:\r\n\r\n“‘Tad,’ if you will be a good boy, and not disturb me any more until we\r\nget to Fortress Monroe, I will give you a dollar.”\r\n\r\nThe hope of reward was effectual for awhile in securing silence, but,\r\nboylike, “Tad” soon forgot his promise, and was as noisy as ever. Upon\r\nreaching their destination, however, he said, very promptly: “Father,\r\nI want my dollar.” Mr. Lincoln looked at him half-reproachfully for an\r\ninstant, and then, taking from his pocketbook a dollar note, he said\r\n“Well, my son, at any rate, I will keep my part of the bargain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELLS AN EDITOR ABOUT NASBY.\r\n\r\nHenry J. Raymond, the famous New York editor, thus tells of Mr.\r\nLincoln’s fondness for the Nasby letters:\r\n\r\n“It has been well said by a profound critic of Shakespeare, and it\r\noccurs to me as very appropriate in this connection, that the spirit\r\nwhich held the woe of Lear and the tragedy of “Hamlet” would have broken\r\nhad it not also had the humor of the “Merry Wives of Windsor” and the\r\nmerriment of the “Midsummer Night’s Dream.”\r\n\r\n“This is as true of Mr. Lincoln as it was of Shakespeare. The capacity\r\nto tell and enjoy a good anecdote no doubt prolonged his life.\r\n\r\n“The Saturday evening before he left Washington to go to the front, just\r\nprevious to the capture of Richmond, I was with him from seven o’clock\r\ntill nearly twelve. It had been one of his most trying days. The\r\npressure of office-seekers was greater at this juncture than I ever knew\r\nit to be, and he was almost worn out.\r\n\r\n“Among the callers that evening was a party composed of two Senators,\r\na Representative, an ex-Lieutenant-Governor of a Western State, and\r\nseveral private citizens. They had business of great importance,\r\ninvolving the necessity of the President’s examination of voluminous\r\ndocuments. Pushing everything aside, he said to one of the party:\r\n\r\n“‘Have you seen the Nasby papers?’\r\n\r\n“‘No, I have not,’ was the reply; ‘who is Nasby?’\r\n\r\n“‘There is a chap out in Ohio,’ returned the President, ‘who has been\r\nwriting a series of letters in the newspapers over the signature of\r\nPetroleum V. Nasby. Some one sent me a pamphlet collection of them the\r\nother day. I am going to write to “Petroleum” to come down here, and I\r\nintend to tell him if he will communicate his talent to me, I will swap\r\nplaces with him!’\r\n\r\n“Thereupon he arose, went to a drawer in his desk, and, taking out\r\nthe ‘Letters,’ sat down and read one to the company, finding in their\r\nenjoyment of it the temporary excitement and relief which another man\r\nwould have found in a glass of wine. The instant he had ceased, the book\r\nwas thrown aside, his countenance relapsed into its habitual serious\r\nexpression, and the business was entered upon with the utmost\r\nearnestness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG AND SHORT OF IT.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a serenade, the President was called for by the crowd\r\nassembled. He appeared at a window with his wife (who was somewhat below\r\nthe medium height), and made the following “brief remarks”:\r\n\r\n“Here I am, and here is Mrs. Lincoln. That’s the long and the short of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE PEGS THAN HOLES.\r\n\r\nSome gentlemen were once finding fault with the President because\r\ncertain generals were not given commands.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” replied President Lincoln, “I have got more pegs than I\r\nhave holes to put them in.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“WEBSTER COULDN’T HAVE DONE MORE.”\r\n\r\nLincoln “got even” with the Illinois Central Railroad Company, in 1855,\r\nin a most substantial way, at the same time secured sweet revenge for an\r\ninsult, unwarranted in every way, put upon him by one of the officials\r\nof that corporation.\r\n\r\nLincoln and Herndon defended the Illinois Central Railroad in an action\r\nbrought by McLean County, Illinois, in August, 1853, to recover taxes\r\nalleged to be due the county from the road. The Legislature had granted\r\nthe road immunity from taxation, and this was a case intended to test\r\nthe constitutionality of the law. The road sent a retainer fee of $250.\r\n\r\nIn the lower court the case was decided in favor of the railroad. An\r\nappeal to the Supreme Court followed, was argued twice, and finally\r\ndecided in favor of the road. This last decision was rendered some time\r\nin 1855. Lincoln then went to Chicago and presented the bill for legal\r\nservices. Lincoln and Herndon only asked for $2,000 more.\r\n\r\nThe official to whom he was referred, after looking at the bill,\r\nexpressed great surprise.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” he exclaimed, “this is as much as Daniel Webster himself\r\nwould have charged. We cannot allow such a claim.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” asked Lincoln.\r\n\r\n“We could have hired first-class lawyers at that figure,” was the\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\n“We won the case, didn’t we?” queried Lincoln.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied the official.\r\n\r\n“Daniel Webster, then,” retorted Lincoln in no amiable tone, “couldn’t\r\nhave done more,” and “Abe” walked out of the official’s office.\r\n\r\nLincoln withdrew the bill, and started for home. On the way he stopped\r\nat Bloomington, where he met Grant Goodrich, Archibald Williams, Norman\r\nB. Judd, O. H. Browning, and other attorneys, who, on learning of his\r\nmodest charge for the valuable services rendered the railroad, induced\r\nhim to increase the demand to $5,000, and to bring suit for that sum.\r\n\r\nThis was done at once. On the trial six lawyers certified that the bill\r\nwas reasonable, and judgment for that sum went by default; the judgment\r\nwas promptly paid, and, of course, his partner, Herndon, got “your half\r\nBilly,” without delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN MET CLAY.\r\n\r\nWhen a member of Congress, Lincoln went to Lexington, Kentucky, to hear\r\nHenry Clay speak. The Westerner, a Kentuckian by birth, and destined\r\nto reach the great goal Clay had so often sought, wanted to meet the\r\n“Millboy of the Slashes.” The address was a tame affair, as was the\r\npersonal greeting when Lincoln made himself known. Clay was courteous,\r\nbut cold. He may never have heard of the man, then in his presence, who\r\nwas to secure, without solicitation, the prize which he for many years\r\nhad unsuccessfully sought. Lincoln was disenchanted; his ideal was\r\nshattered. One reason why Clay had not realized his ambition had become\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nClay was cool and dignified; Lincoln was cordial and hearty. Clay’s hand\r\nwas bloodless and frosty, with no vigorous grip in it; Lincoln’s was\r\nwarm, and its clasp was expressive of kindliness and sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINDED “ABE” OF A LITTLE JOKE.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln had a little joke at the expense of General George B.\r\nMcClellan, the Democratic candidate for the Presidency in opposition\r\nto the Westerner in 1864. McClellan was nominated by the Democratic\r\nNational Convention, which assembled at Chicago, but after he had\r\nbeen named, and also during the campaign, the military candidate was\r\ncharacteristically slow in coming to the front.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln had his eye upon every move made by General McClellan\r\nduring the campaign, and when reference was made one day, in his\r\npresence, to the deliberation and caution of the New Jerseyite,\r\nMr. Lincoln remarked, with a twinkle in his eye, “Perhaps he is\r\nintrenching.”\r\n\r\nThe cartoon we reproduce appeared in “Harper’s Weekly,” September 17th,\r\n1864, and shows General McClellan, with his little spade in hand, being\r\nsubjected to the scrutiny of the President--the man who gave McClellan,\r\nwhen the latter was Commander-in-Chief of the Union forces, every\r\nopportunity in the world to distinguish himself. There is a smile on the\r\nface of “Honest Abe,” which shows conclusively that he does not regard\r\nhis political opponent as likely to prove formidable in any way.\r\nPresident Lincoln “sized up” McClellan in 1861-2, and knew, to a\r\nfraction, how much of a man he was, what he could do, and how he went\r\nabout doing it. McClellan was no politician, while the President was the\r\nshrewdest of political diplomats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS DIGNITY SAVED HIM.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington had become an armed camp, and full of soldiers,\r\nPresident Lincoln and his Cabinet officers drove daily to one or another\r\nof these camps. Very often his outing for the day was attending some\r\nceremony incident to camp life: a military funeral, a camp wedding, a\r\nreview, a flag-raising. He did not often make speeches. “I have made a\r\ngreat many poor speeches,” he said one day, in excusing himself, “and\r\nI now feel relieved that my dignity does not permit me to be a public\r\nspeaker.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN HE WAS LOOKING FOR\r\n\r\nJudge Kelly, of Pennsylvania, who was one of the committee to advise\r\nLincoln of his nomination, and who was himself a great many feet high,\r\nhad been eyeing Lincoln’s lofty form with a mixture of admiration and\r\npossibly jealousy.\r\n\r\nThis had not escaped Lincoln, and as he shook hands with the judge he\r\ninquired, “What is your height?”\r\n\r\n“Six feet three. What is yours, Mr. Lincoln?”\r\n\r\n“Six feet four.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the judge, “Pennsylvania bows to Illinois. My dear man, for\r\nyears my heart has been aching for a President that I could look up to,\r\nand I’ve at last found him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS CABINET CHANCES POOR.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeriah Bonham, in describing a visit he paid Lincoln at his room in\r\nthe State House at Springfield, where he found him quite alone, except\r\nthat two of his children, one of whom was “Tad,” were with him.\r\n\r\n“The door was open.\r\n\r\n“We walked in and were at once recognized and seated--the two boys still\r\ncontinuing their play about the room. “Tad” was spinning his top; and\r\nLincoln, as we entered, had just finished adjusting the string for him\r\nso as to give the top the greatest degree of force. He remarked that he\r\nwas having a little fun with the boys.”\r\n\r\nAt another time, at Lincoln’s residence, “Tad” came into the room, and,\r\nputting his hand to his mouth, and his mouth to his father’s ear, said,\r\nin a boy’s whisper: “Ma says come to supper.”\r\n\r\nAll heard the announcement; and Lincoln, perceiving this, said: “You\r\nhave heard, gentlemen, the announcement concerning the interesting state\r\nof things in the dining-room. It will never do for me, if elected, to\r\nmake this young man a member of my Cabinet, for it is plain he cannot be\r\ntrusted with secrets of state.”\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL WAS “HEADED IN”\r\n\r\nA Union general, operating with his command in West Virginia, allowed\r\nhimself and his men to be trapped, and it was feared his force would be\r\ncaptured by the Confederates. The President heard the report read by the\r\noperator, as it came over the wire, and remarked:\r\n\r\n“Once there was a man out West who was ‘heading’ a barrel, as they used\r\nto call it. He worked like a good fellow in driving down the hoops, but\r\njust about the time he thought he had the job done, the head would fall\r\nin. Then he had to do the work all over again.\r\n\r\n“All at once a bright idea entered his brain, and he wondered how it\r\nwas he hadn’t figured it out before. His boy, a bright, smart lad, was\r\nstanding by, very much interested in the business, and, lifting the young\r\none up, he put him inside the barrel, telling him to hold the head in\r\nits proper place, while he pounded down the hoops on the sides. This\r\nworked like a charm, and he soon had the ‘heading’ done.\r\n\r\n“Then he realized that his boy was inside the barrel, and how to get him\r\nout he couldn’t for his life figure out. General Blank is now inside the\r\nbarrel, ‘headed in,’ and the job now is to get him out.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR-COATED.\r\n\r\nGovernment Printer Defrees, when one of the President’s messages\r\nwas being printed, was a good deal disturbed by the use of the term\r\n“sugar-coated,” and finally went to Mr. Lincoln about it.\r\n\r\nTheir relations to each other being of the most intimate character, he\r\ntold the President frankly that he ought to remember that a message\r\nto Congress was a different affair from a speech at a mass meeting in\r\nIllinois; that the messages became a part of history, and should be\r\nwritten accordingly.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter now?” inquired the President.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Defrees, “you have used an undignified expression in the\r\nmessage”; and, reading the paragraph aloud, he added, “I would alter the\r\nstructure of that, if I were you.”\r\n\r\n“Defrees,” replied the President, “that word expresses exactly my\r\nidea, and I am not going to change it. The time will never come in this\r\ncountry when people won’t know exactly what ‘sugar-coated’ means.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOULD MAKE “RABBIT-TRACKS.”\r\n\r\nWhen a grocery clerk at New Salem, the annual election came around. A\r\nMr. Graham was clerk, but his assistant was absent, and it was necessary\r\nto find a man to fill his place. Lincoln, a “tall young man,” had\r\nalready concentrated on himself the attention of the people of the town,\r\nand Graham easily discovered him. Asking him if he could write, “Abe”\r\n modestly replied, “I can make a few rabbit-tracks.” His rabbit-tracks\r\nproving to be legible and even graceful, he was employed.\r\n\r\nThe voters soon discovered that the new assistant clerk was honest and\r\nfair, and performed his duties satisfactorily, and when, the work done,\r\nhe began to “entertain them with stories,” they found that their town\r\nhad made a valuable personal and social acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN PROTECTED CURRENCY ISSUES.\r\n\r\nMarshal Ward Lamon was in President Lincoln’s office in the White House\r\none day, and casually asked the President if he knew how the currency\r\nof the country was made. Greenbacks were then under full headway of\r\ncirculation, these bits of paper being the representatives of United\r\nState money.\r\n\r\n“Our currency,” was the President’s answer, “is made, as the lawyers\r\nwould put it, in their legal way, in the following manner, to-wit:\r\nThe official engraver strikes off the sheets, passes them over to the\r\nRegister of the Currency, who, after placing his earmarks upon them,\r\nsigns the same; the Register turns them over to old Father Spinner, who\r\nproceeds to embellish them with his wonderful signature at the bottom;\r\nFather Spinner sends them to Secretary of the Treasury Chase, and he, as\r\na final act in the matter, issues them to the public as money--and may\r\nthe good Lord help any fellow that doesn’t take all he can honestly get\r\nof them!”\r\n\r\nTaking from his pocket a $5 greenback, with a twinkle in his eye,\r\nthe President then said: “Look at Spinner’s signature! Was there ever\r\nanything like it on earth? Yet it is unmistakable; no one will ever be\r\nable to counterfeit it!”\r\n\r\nLamon then goes on to say:\r\n\r\n“‘But,’ I said, ‘you certainly don’t suppose that Spinner actually wrote\r\nhis name on that bill, do you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly, I do; why not?’ queried Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n“I then asked, ‘How much of this currency have we afloat?’\r\n\r\n“He remained thoughtful for a moment, and then stated the amount.\r\n\r\n“I continued: ‘How many times do you think a man can write a signature\r\nlike Spinner’s in the course of twenty-four hours?’\r\n\r\n“The beam of hilarity left the countenance of the President at once.\r\nHe put the greenback into his vest pocket, and walked the floor; after\r\nawhile he stopped, heaved a long breath and said: ‘This thing frightens\r\nme!’ He then rang for a messenger and told him to ask the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to please come over to see him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Chase soon put in an appearance; President Lincoln stated the cause\r\nof his alarm, and asked Mr. Chase to explain in detail the operations,\r\nmethods, system of checks, etc., in his office, and a lengthy discussion\r\nfollowed, President Lincoln contending there were not sufficient\r\nsafeguards afforded in any degree in the money-making department, and\r\nSecretary Chase insisting that every protection was afforded he could\r\ndevise.”\r\n\r\nAfterward the President called the attention of Congress to this\r\nimportant question, and devices were adopted whereby a check was put\r\nupon the issue of greenbacks that no spurious ones ever came out of the\r\nTreasury Department, at least. Counterfeiters were busy, though, but\r\nthis was not the fault of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S APOLOGY TO GRANT.\r\n\r\n“General Grant is a copious worker and fighter,” President Lincoln wrote\r\nto General Burnside in July, 1863, “but a meagre writer or telegrapher.”\r\n\r\nGrant never wrote a report until the battle was over.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln wrote a letter to General Grant on July 13th, 1863,\r\nwhich indicated the strength of the hold the successful fighter had upon\r\nthe man in the White House.\r\n\r\nIt ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“I do not remember that you and I ever met personally.\r\n\r\n“I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost\r\ninestimable service you have done the country.\r\n\r\n“I write to say a word further.\r\n\r\n“When you first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should\r\ndo what you finally did--march the troops across the neck, run the\r\nbatteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I never had any\r\nfaith, except a general hope, that you knew better than I, that the\r\nYazoo Pass expedition, and the like, could succeed.\r\n\r\n“When you got below and took Port Gibson, Grand Gulf and vicinity, I\r\nthought you should go down the river and join General Banks; and when\r\nyou turned northward, east of Big Black, I feared it was a mistake.\r\n\r\n“I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right and\r\nI was wrong.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN SAID “BY JING.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln never used profanity, except when he quoted it to illustrate a\r\npoint in a story. His favorite expressions when he spoke with emphasis\r\nwere “By dear!” and “By jing!”\r\n\r\nJust preceding the Civil War he sent Ward Lamon on a ticklish mission to\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nWhen the proposed trip was mentioned to Secretary Seward, he opposed it,\r\nsaying, “Mr. President, I fear you are sending Lamon to his grave. I am\r\nafraid they will kill him in Charleston, where the people are excited\r\nand desperate. We can’t spare Lamon, and we shall feel badly if anything\r\nhappens to him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said in reply: “I have known Lamon to be in many a close\r\nplace, and he has never, been in one that he didn’t get out of, somehow.\r\nBy jing! I’ll risk him. Go ahead, Lamon, and God bless you! If you\r\ncan’t bring back any good news, bring a palmetto.” Lamon brought back a\r\npalmetto branch, but no promise of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT TICKLED THE LITTLE WOMAN.\r\n\r\nLincoln had been in the telegraph office at Springfield during the\r\ncasting of the first and second ballots in the Republican National\r\nConvention at Chicago, and then left and went over to the office of the\r\nState Journal, where he was sitting conversing with friends while the\r\nthird ballot was being taken.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments came across the wires the announcement of the result.\r\nThe superintendent of the telegraph company wrote on a scrap of paper:\r\n“Mr. Lincoln, you are nominated on the third ballot,” and a boy ran with\r\nthe message to Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHe looked at it in silence, amid the shouts of those around him; then\r\nrising and putting it in his pocket, he said quietly: “There’s a little\r\nwoman down at our house would like to hear this; I’ll go down and tell\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SHALL ALL FALL TOGETHER.”\r\n\r\nAfter Lincoln had finished that celebrated speech in “Egypt” (as a\r\nsection of Southern Illinois was formerly designated), in the course\r\nof which he seized Congressman Ficklin by the coat collar and shook him\r\nfiercely, he apologized. In return, Ficklin said Lincoln had “nearly\r\nshaken the Democracy out of him.” To this Lincoln replied:\r\n\r\n“That reminds me of what Paul said to Agrippa, which, in language and\r\nsubstance, was about this: ‘I would to God that such Democracy as you\r\nfolks here in Egypt have were not only almost, but altogether, shaken\r\nout of, not only you, but all that heard me this day, and that you would\r\nall join in assisting in shaking off the shackles of the bondmen by all\r\nlegitimate means, so that this country may be made free as the good Lord\r\nintended it.’”\r\n\r\nSaid Ficklin in rejoinder: “Lincoln, I remember of reading somewhere in\r\nthe same book from which you get your Agrippa story, that Paul, whom\r\nyou seem to desire to personate, admonished all servants (slaves) to be\r\nobedient to them that are their masters according to the flesh, in fear\r\nand trembling.\r\n\r\n“It would seem that neither our Savior nor Paul saw the iniquity of\r\nslavery as you and your party do. But you must not think that where you\r\nfail by argument to convince an old friend like myself and win him over\r\nto your heterodox abolition opinions, you are justified in resorting to\r\nviolence such as you practiced on me to-day.\r\n\r\n“Why, I never had such a shaking up in the whole course of my life.\r\nRecollect that that good old book that you quote from somewhere says in\r\neffect this: ‘Woe be unto him who goeth to Egypt for help, for he shall\r\nfall. The holpen shall fall, and they shall all fall together.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAD DOG NO CURE.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s quarrel with Shields was his last personal encounter. In\r\nlater years it became his duty to give an official reprimand to a young\r\nofficer who had been court-martialed for a quarrel with one of his\r\nassociates. The reprimand is probably the gentlest on record:\r\n\r\n“Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can\r\nspare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all\r\nthe consequences, including the vitiating of his temper and the loss\r\nof self-control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more than\r\nequal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own.\r\n\r\n“Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for\r\nthe right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THOROUGH” IS A GOOD WORD.\r\n\r\nSome one came to the President with a story about a plot to accomplish\r\nsome mischief in the Government. Lincoln listened to what was a very\r\nsuperficial and ill-formed story, and then said: “There is one\r\nthing that I have learned, and that you have not. It is only one\r\nword--‘thorough.’”\r\n\r\nThen, bringing his hand down on the table with a thump to emphasize his\r\nmeaning, he added, “thorough!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET WAS A-SETTIN’.\r\n\r\nBeing in Washington one day, the Rev. Robert Collyer thought he’d take a\r\nlook around. In passing through the grounds surrounding the White House,\r\nhe cast a glance toward the Presidential residence, and was astonished\r\nto see three pairs of feet resting on the ledge of an open window in one\r\nof the apartments of the second story. The divine paused for a moment,\r\ncalmly surveyed the unique spectacle, and then resumed his walk toward\r\nthe War Department.\r\n\r\nSeeing a laborer at work not far from the Executive Mansion, Mr.\r\nCollyer asked him what it all meant. To whom did the feet belong, and,\r\nparticularly, the mammoth ones? “You old fool,” answered the workman,\r\n“that’s the Cabinet, which is a-settin’, an’ them thar big feet belongs\r\nto ‘Old Abe.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BULLET THROUGH HIS HAT.\r\n\r\nA soldier tells the following story of an attempt upon the life of Mr.\r\nLincoln “One night I was doing sentinel duty at the entrance to the\r\nSoldiers’ Home. This was about the middle of August, 1864. About eleven\r\no’clock I heard a rifle shot, in the direction of the city, and shortly\r\nafterwards I heard approaching hoof-beats. In two or three minutes a\r\nhorse came dashing up. I recognized the belated President. The President\r\nwas bareheaded. The President simply thought that his horse had taken\r\nfright at the discharge of the firearms.\r\n\r\n“On going back to the place where the shot had been heard, we found\r\nthe President’s hat. It was a plain silk hat, and upon examination we\r\ndiscovered a bullet hole through the crown.\r\n\r\n“The next day, upon receiving the hat, the President remarked that it\r\nwas made by some foolish marksman, and was not intended for him; but\r\nadded that he wished nothing said about the matter.\r\n\r\n“The President said, philosophically: ‘I long ago made up my mind that\r\nif anybody wants to kill me, he will do it. Besides, in this case, it\r\nseems to me, the man who would succeed me would be just as objectionable\r\nto my enemies--if I have any.’\r\n\r\n“One dark night, as he was going out with a friend, he took along a\r\nheavy cane, remarking, good-naturedly: ‘Mother (Mrs. Lincoln) has got a\r\nnotion into her head that I shall be assassinated, and to please her I\r\ntake a cane when I go over to the War Department at night--when I don’t\r\nforget it.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO KIND TO GET TO HEAVEN ON.\r\n\r\nTwo ladies from Tennessee called at the White House one day and begged\r\nMr. Lincoln to release their husbands, who were rebel prisoners at\r\nJohnson’s Island. One of the fair petitioners urged as a reason for the\r\nliberation of her husband that he was a very religious man, and rang the\r\nchanges on this pious plea.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Mr. Lincoln, “you say your husband is a religious man.\r\nPerhaps I am not a good judge of such matters, but in my opinion the\r\nreligion that makes men rebel and fight against their government is not\r\nthe genuine article; nor is the religion the right sort which reconciles\r\nthem to the idea of eating their bread in the sweat of other men’s\r\nfaces. It is not the kind to get to heaven on.”\r\n\r\nLater, however, the order of release was made, President Lincoln\r\nremarking, with impressive solemnity, that he would expect the ladies\r\nto subdue the rebellious spirit of their husbands, and to that end he\r\nthought it would be well to reform their religion. “True patriotism,”\r\n said he, “is better than the wrong kind of piety.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ONLY REAL PEACEMAKER.\r\n\r\nDuring the Presidential campaign of 1864 much ill-feeling was displayed\r\nby the opposition to President Lincoln. The Democratic managers issued\r\nposters of large dimensions, picturing the Washington Administration as\r\none determined to rule or ruin the country, while the only salvation for\r\nthe United States was the election of McClellan.\r\n\r\nWe reproduce one of these 1864 campaign posters on this page, the title\r\nof which is, “The True Issue; or ‘That’s What’s the Matter.’”\r\n\r\nThe dominant idea or purpose of the cartoon-poster was to demonstrate\r\nMcClellan’s availability. Lincoln, the Abolitionist, and Davis, the\r\nSecessionist, are pictured as bigots of the worst sort, who were\r\ndetermined that peace should not be restored to the distracted country,\r\nexcept upon the lines laid down by them. McClellan, the patriotic\r\npeacemaker, is shown as the man who believed in the preservation of the\r\nUnion above all things--a man who had no fads nor vagaries.\r\n\r\nThis peacemaker, McClellan, standing upon “the War-is-a-failure”\r\n platform, is portrayed as a military chieftain, who would stand no\r\nnonsense; who would compel Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Davis to cease their\r\nquarreling; who would order the soldiers on both sides to quit their\r\nblood-letting and send the combatants back to the farm, workshop and\r\ncounting-house; and the man whose election would restore order out of\r\nchaos, and make everything bright and lovely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE WOMAN’S PASS.\r\n\r\nOne day when President Lincoln was receiving callers a buxom Irish woman\r\ncame into the office, and, standing before the President, with her hands\r\non her hips, said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln, can’t I sell apples on the railroad?”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln replied: “Certainly, madam, you can sell all you\r\nwish.”\r\n\r\n“But,” she said, “you must give me a pass, or the soldiers will not let\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln then wrote a few lines and gave them to her.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir; God bless you!” she exclaimed as she departed joyfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLIT RAILS BY THE YARD.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1830 that “Abe” Lincoln, “wearing a jean jacket,\r\nshrunken buckskin trousers, a coonskin cap, and driving an ox-team,”\r\n became a citizen of Illinois. He was physically and mentally equipped\r\nfor pioneer work. His first desire was to obtain a new and decent suit\r\nof clothes, but, as he had no money, he was glad to arrange with Nancy\r\nMiller to make him a pair of trousers, he to split four hundred fence\r\nrails for each yard of cloth--fourteen hundred rails in all. “Abe” got\r\nthe clothes after awhile.\r\n\r\nIt was three miles from his father’s cabin to her wood-lot, where he\r\nmade the forest ring with the sound of his ax. “Abe” had helped his\r\nfather plow fifteen acres of land, and split enough rails to fence it,\r\nand he then helped to plow fifty acres for another settler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF LEGS.\r\n\r\nWhenever the people of Lincoln’s neighborhood engaged in dispute;\r\nwhenever a bet was to be decided; when they differed on points of\r\nreligion or politics; when they wanted to get out of trouble, or desired\r\nadvice regarding anything on the earth, below it, above it, or under the\r\nsea, they went to “Abe.”\r\n\r\nTwo fellows, after a hot dispute lasting some hours, over the problem\r\nas to how long a man’s legs should be in proportion to the size of his\r\nbody, stamped into Lincoln’s office one day and put the question to him.\r\n\r\nLincoln listened gravely to the arguments advanced by both contestants,\r\nspent some time in “reflecting” upon the matter, and then, turning\r\naround in his chair and facing the disputants, delivered his opinion\r\nwith all the gravity of a judge sentencing a fellow-being to death.\r\n\r\n“This question has been a source of controversy,” he said, slowly\r\nand deliberately, “for untold ages, and it is about time it should be\r\ndefinitely decided. It has led to bloodshed in the past, and there is no\r\nreason to suppose it will not lead to the same in the future.\r\n\r\n“After much thought and consideration, not to mention mental worry and\r\nanxiety, it is my opinion, all side issues being swept aside, that a\r\nman’s lower limbs, in order to preserve harmony of proportion, should be\r\nat least long enough to reach from his body to the ground.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO MANY WIDOWS ALREADY.\r\n\r\nA Union officer in conversation one day told this story:\r\n\r\n“The first week I was with my command there were twenty-four deserters\r\nsentenced by court-martial to be shot, and the warrants for their\r\nexecution were sent to the President to be signed. He refused.\r\n\r\n“I went to Washington and had an interview. I said:\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. President, unless these men are made an example of, the army\r\nitself is in danger. Mercy to the few is cruelty to the many.’\r\n\r\n“He replied: ‘Mr. General, there are already too many weeping widows in\r\nthe United States. For God’s sake, don’t ask me to add to the number,\r\nfor I won’t do it.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOD NEEDED THAT CHURCH.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the war, after several battles had been fought,\r\nUnion troops seized a church in Alexandria, Va., and used it as a\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nA prominent lady of the congregation went to Washington to see Mr.\r\nLincoln and try to get an order for its release.\r\n\r\n“Have you applied to the surgeon in charge at Alexandria?” inquired Mr.\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, but I can do nothing with him,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Well, madam,” said Mr. Lincoln, “that is an end of it, then. We put him\r\nthere to attend to just such business, and it is reasonable to suppose\r\nthat he knows better what should be done under the circumstances than I\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\nThe lady’s face showed her keen disappointment. In order to learn her\r\nsentiment, Mr. Lincoln asked:\r\n\r\n“How much would you be willing to subscribe toward building a hospital\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\nShe said that the war had depreciated Southern property so much that she\r\ncould afford to give but little.\r\n\r\n“This war is not over yet,” said Mr. Lincoln, “and there will likely\r\nbe another fight very soon. That church may be very useful in which to\r\nhouse our wounded soldiers. It is my candid opinion that God needs that\r\nchurch for our wounded fellows; so, madam, I can do nothing for you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN DOWN SOUTH.\r\n\r\nAn amusing instance of the President’s preoccupation of mind occurred\r\nat one of his levees, when he was shaking hands with a host of visitors\r\npassing him in a continuous stream.\r\n\r\nAn intimate acquaintance received the usual conventional hand-shake and\r\nsalutation, but perceiving that he was not recognized, kept his ground\r\ninstead of moving on, and spoke again, when the President, roused to\r\na dim consciousness that something unusual had happened, perceived\r\nwho stood before him, and, seizing his friend’s hand, shook it again\r\nheartily, saying:\r\n\r\n“How do you do? How do you do? Excuse me for not noticing you. I was\r\nthinking of a man down South.”\r\n\r\n“The man down South” was General W. T. Sherman, then on his march to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOULDN’T LET GO THE HOG.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania described the terrible butchery at\r\nthe battle of Fredericksburg, Mr. Lincoln was almost broken-hearted.\r\n\r\nThe Governor regretted that his description had so sadly affected the\r\nPresident. He remarked: “I would give all I possess to know how to\r\nrescue you from this terrible war.” Then Mr. Lincoln’s wonderful\r\nrecuperative powers asserted themselves and this marvelous man was\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s whole aspect suddenly changed, and he relieved his mind by\r\ntelling a story.\r\n\r\n“This reminds me, Governor,” he said, “of an old farmer out in Illinois\r\nthat I used to know.\r\n\r\n“He took it into his head to go into hog-raising. He sent out to Europe\r\nand imported the finest breed of hogs he could buy.\r\n\r\n“The prize hog was put in a pen, and the farmer’s two mischievous boys,\r\nJames and John, were told to be sure not to let it out. But James, the\r\nworst of the two, let the brute out the next day. The hog went straight\r\nfor the boys, and drove John up a tree, then the hog went for the seat\r\nof James’ trousers, and the only way the boy could save himself was by\r\nholding on to the hog’s tail.\r\n\r\n“The hog would not give up his hunt, nor the boy his hold! After they\r\nhad made a good many circles around the tree, the boy’s courage began to\r\ngive out, and he shouted to his brother, ‘I say, John, come down, quick,\r\nand help me let go this hog!’\r\n\r\n“Now, Governor, that is exactly my case. I wish some one would come and\r\nhelp me to let the hog go.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET LINCOLN WANTED.\r\n\r\nJudge Joseph Gillespie, of Chicago, was a firm friend of Mr. Lincoln,\r\nand went to Springfield to see him shortly before his departure for the\r\ninauguration.\r\n\r\n“It was,” said judge Gillespie, “Lincoln’s Gethsemane. He feared he was\r\nnot the man for the great position and the great events which confronted\r\nhim. Untried in national affairs, unversed in international diplomacy,\r\nunacquainted with the men who were foremost in the politics of the\r\nnation, he groaned when he saw the inevitable War of the Rebellion\r\ncoming on. It was in humility of spirit that he told me he believed that\r\nthe American people had made a mistake in selecting him.\r\n\r\n“In the course of our conversation he told me if he could select his\r\ncabinet from the old bar that had traveled the circuit with him in\r\nthe early days, he believed he could avoid war or settle it without a\r\nbattle, even after the fact of secession.\r\n\r\n“‘But, Mr. Lincoln,’ said I, ‘those old lawyers are all Democrats.’\r\n\r\n“‘I know it,’ was his reply. ‘But I would rather have Democrats whom I\r\nknow than Republicans I don’t know.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREADY FOR “BUTCHER-DAY.”\r\n\r\nLeonard Swett told this eminently characteristic story:\r\n\r\n“I remember one day being in his room when Lincoln was sitting at his\r\ntable with a large pile of papers before him, and after a pleasant talk\r\nhe turned quite abruptly and said: ‘Get out of the way, Swett; to-morrow\r\nis butcher-day, and I must go through these papers and see if I cannot\r\nfind some excuse to let these poor fellows off.’\r\n\r\n“The pile of papers he had were the records of courts-martial of men who\r\non the following day were to be shot.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE BAD BIRD AND THE MUDSILL.”\r\n\r\nIt took quite a long time, as well as the lives of thousands of men, to\r\nsay nothing of the cost in money, to take Richmond, the Capital City of\r\nthe Confederacy. In this cartoon, taken from “Frank Leslie’s Illustrated\r\nNewspaper,” of February 21, 1863, Jeff Davis is sitting upon the\r\nSecession eggs in the “Richmond” nest, smiling down upon President\r\nLincoln, who is up to his waist in the Mud of Difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe President finally waded through the morass, in which he had become\r\nimmersed, got to the tree, climbed its trunk, reached the limb, upon\r\nwhich the “bad bird” had built its nest, threw the mother out, destroyed\r\nthe eggs of Secession and then took the nest away with him, leaving the\r\n“bad bird” without any home at all.\r\n\r\nThe “bad bird” had its laugh first, but the last laugh belonged to the\r\n“mudsill,” as the cartoonist was pleased to call the President of the\r\nUnited States. It is true that the President got his clothes and hat all\r\ncovered with mud, but as the job was a dirty one, as well as one that\r\nhad to be done, the President didn’t care. He was able to get another\r\nsuit of clothes, as well as another hat, but the “bad bird” couldn’t,\r\nand didn’t, get another nest.\r\n\r\nThe laugh was on the “bad bird” after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAVE THE SOLDIER HIS FISH.\r\n\r\nOnce, when asked what he remembered about the war with Great Britain,\r\nLincoln replied: “Nothing but this: I had been fishing one day and\r\ncaught a little fish, which I was taking home. I met a soldier in the\r\nroad, and, having been always told at home that we must be good to the\r\nsoldiers, I gave him my fish.”\r\n\r\nThis must have been about 1814, when “Abe” was five years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PECULIAR LAWYER.\r\n\r\nLincoln was once associate counsel for a defendant in a murder case.\r\nHe listened to the testimony given by witness after witness against his\r\nclient, until his honest heart could stand it no longer; then, turning\r\nto his associate, he said: “The man is guilty; you defend him--I can’t,”\r\n and when his associate secured a verdict of acquittal, Lincoln refused\r\nto share the fee to the extent of one cent.\r\n\r\nLincoln would never advise clients to enter into unwise or unjust\r\nlawsuits, always preferring to refuse a retainer rather than be a party\r\nto a case which did not commend itself to his sense of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF THEY’D ONLY “SKIP.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Creswell called at the White House to see the President the day\r\nof the latter’s assassination. An old friend, serving in the Confederate\r\nranks, had been captured by the Union troops and sent to prison. He\r\nhad drawn an affidavit setting forth what he knew about the man,\r\nparticularly mentioning extenuating circumstances.\r\n\r\nCreswell found the President very happy. He was greeted with: “Creswell,\r\nold fellow, everything is bright this morning. The War is over. It has\r\nbeen a tough time, but we have lived it out,--or some of us have,” and\r\nhe dropped his voice a little on the last clause of the sentence. “But\r\nit is over; we are going to have good times now, and a united country.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Creswell told his story, read his affidavit, and said, “I know\r\nthe man has acted like a fool, but he is my friend, and a good fellow;\r\nlet him out; give him to me, and I will be responsible that he won’t\r\nhave anything more to do with the rebs.”\r\n\r\n“Creswell,” replied Mr. Lincoln, “you make me think of a lot of young\r\nfolks who once started out Maying. To reach their destination, they had\r\nto cross a shallow stream, and did so by means of an old flatboat. When\r\nthe time came to return, they found to their dismay that the old scow\r\nhad disappeared. They were in sore trouble, and thought over all manner\r\nof devices for getting over the water, but without avail.\r\n\r\n“After a time, one of the boys proposed that each fellow should pick up\r\nthe girl he liked best and wade over with her. The masterly proposition\r\nwas carried out, until all that were left upon the island was a little\r\nshort chap and a great, long, gothic-built, elderly lady.\r\n\r\n“Now, Creswell, you are trying to leave me in the same predicament. You\r\nfellows are all getting your own friends out of this scrape; and you\r\nwill succeed in carrying off one after another, until nobody but Jeff\r\nDavis and myself will be left on the island, and then I won’t know what\r\nto do. How should I feel? How should I look, lugging him over?\r\n\r\n“I guess the way to avoid such an embarrassing situation is to let them\r\nall out at once.”\r\n\r\nHe made a somewhat similar illustration at an informal Cabinet meeting,\r\nat which the disposition of Jefferson Davis and other prominent\r\nConfederates was discussed. Each member of the Cabinet gave his\r\nopinion; most of them were for hanging the traitors, or for some severe\r\npunishment. President Lincoln said nothing.\r\n\r\nFinally, Joshua F. Speed, his old and confidential friend, who had\r\nbeen invited to the meeting, said, “I have heard the opinion of your\r\nMinisters, and would like to hear yours.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Josh,” replied President Lincoln, “when I was a boy in Indiana,\r\nI went to a neighbor’s house one morning and found a boy of my own size\r\nholding a coon by a string. I asked him what he had and what he was\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n“He says, ‘It’s a coon. Dad cotched six last night, and killed all but\r\nthis poor little cuss. Dad told me to hold him until he came back, and\r\nI’m afraid he’s going to kill this one too; and oh, “Abe,” I do wish he\r\nwould get away!’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, why don’t you let him loose?’\r\n\r\n“‘That wouldn’t be right; and if I let him go, Dad would give me h--.\r\nBut if he got away himself, it would be all right.’\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the President, “if Jeff Davis and those other fellows will\r\nonly get away, it will be all right. But if we should catch them, and I\r\nshould let them go, ‘Dad would give me h--!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER OF THE “GREENBACK.”\r\n\r\nDon Piatt, a noted journalist of Washington, told the story of the first\r\nproposition to President Lincoln to issue interest-bearing notes as\r\ncurrency, as follows:\r\n\r\n“Amasa Walker, a distinguished financier of New England, suggested that\r\nnotes issued directly from the Government to the people, as currency,\r\nshould bear interest. This for the purpose, not only of making the notes\r\npopular, but for the purpose of preventing inflation, by inducing people\r\nto hoard the notes as an investment when the demands of trade would fail\r\nto call them into circulation as a currency.\r\n\r\n“This idea struck David Taylor, of Ohio, with such force that he sought\r\nMr. Lincoln and urged him to put the project into immediate execution.\r\nThe President listened patiently, and at the end said, ‘That is a good\r\nidea, Taylor, but you must go to Chase. He is running that end of the\r\nmachine, and has time to consider your proposition.’\r\n\r\n“Taylor sought the Secretary of the Treasury, and laid before him Amasa\r\nWalker’s plan. Secretary Chase heard him through in a cold, unpleasant\r\nmanner, and then said: ‘That is all very well, Mr. Taylor; but there is\r\none little obstacle in the way that makes the plan impracticable, and\r\nthat is the Constitution.’\r\n\r\n“Saying this, he turned to his desk, as if dismissing both Mr. Taylor\r\nand his proposition at the same moment.\r\n\r\n“The poor enthusiast felt rebuked and humiliated. He returned to the\r\nPresident, however, and reported his defeat. Mr. Lincoln looked at\r\nthe would-be financier with the expression at times so peculiar to\r\nhis homely face, that left one in doubt whether he was jesting or in\r\nearnest. ‘Taylor!’ he exclaimed, ‘go back to Chase and tell him not\r\nto bother himself about the Constitution. Say that I have that sacred\r\ninstrument here at the White House, and I am guarding it with great\r\ncare.’\r\n\r\n“Taylor demurred to this, on the ground that Secretary Chase showed by\r\nhis manner that he knew all about it, and didn’t wish to be bored by any\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n“‘We’ll see about that,’ said the President, and taking a card from the\r\ntable, he wrote upon it:\r\n\r\n“‘The Secretary of the Treasury will please consider Mr. Taylor’s\r\nproposition. We must have money, and I think this a good way to get it.\r\n\r\n“‘A. LINCOLN.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR ANDERSON’S BAD MEMORY.\r\n\r\nAmong the men whom Captain Lincoln met in the Black Hawk campaign were\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Zachary Taylor, Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, President\r\nof the Confederacy, and Lieutenant Robert Anderson, all of the United\r\nStates Army.\r\n\r\nJudge Arnold, in his “Life of Abraham Lincoln,” relates that Lincoln and\r\nAnderson did not meet again until some time in 1861. After Anderson had\r\nevacuated Fort Sumter, on visiting Washington, he called at the White\r\nHouse to pay his respects to the President. Lincoln expressed his thanks\r\nto Anderson for his conduct at Fort Sumter, and then said:\r\n\r\n“Major, do you remember of ever meeting me before?”\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. President, I have no recollection of ever having had that\r\npleasure.”\r\n\r\n“My memory is better than yours,” said Lincoln; “you mustered me into\r\nthe service of the United States in 1832, at Dixon’s Ferry, in the Black\r\nHawk war.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO VANDERBILT.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1860, not long before his nomination for the Presidency,\r\nLincoln made several speeches in Eastern cities. To an Illinois\r\nacquaintance, whom he met at the Astor House, in New York, he said: “I\r\nhave the cottage at Springfield, and about three thousand dollars in\r\nmoney. If they make me Vice-President with Seward, as some say they\r\nwill, I hope I shall be able to increase it to twenty thousand, and that\r\nis as much as any man ought to want.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUASHED A BRUTAL LIE.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1864, a New York paper printed the following brutal story:\r\n\r\n“A few days after the battle of Antietam, the President was driving\r\nover the field in an ambulance, accompanied by Marshal Lamon, General\r\nMcClellan and another officer. Heavy details of men were engaged in\r\nthe task of burying the dead. The ambulance had just reached the\r\nneighborhood of the old stone bridge, where the dead were piled\r\nhighest, when Mr. Lincoln, suddenly slapping Marshal Lamon on the knee,\r\nexclaimed: ‘Come, Lamon, give us that song about “Picayune Butler”;\r\nMcClellan has never heard it.’\r\n\r\n“‘Not now, if you please,’ said General McClellan, with a shudder; ‘I\r\nwould prefer to hear it some other place and time.’”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln refused to pay any attention to the story, would\r\nnot read the comments made upon it by the newspapers, and would permit\r\nneither denial nor explanation to be made. The National election was\r\ncoming on, and the President’s friends appealed to him to settle the\r\nmatter for once and all. Marshal Lamon was particularly insistent, but\r\nthe President merely said:\r\n\r\n“Let the thing alone. If I have not established character enough to\r\ngive the lie to this charge, I can only say that I am mistaken in my\r\nown estimate of myself. In politics, every man must skin his own skunk.\r\nThese fellows are welcome to the hide of this one. Its body has already\r\ngiven forth its unsavory odor.”\r\n\r\nBut Lamon would not “let the thing alone.” He submitted to Lincoln a\r\ndraft of what he conceived to be a suitable explanation, after reading\r\nwhich the President said:\r\n\r\n“Lamon, your ‘explanation’ is entirely too belligerent in tone for so\r\ngrave a matter. There is a heap of ‘cussedness’ mixed up with your usual\r\namiability, and you are at times too fond of a fight. If I were you, I\r\nwould simply state the facts as they were. I would give the statement as\r\nyou have here, without the pepper and salt. Let me try my hand at it.”\r\n\r\nThe President then took up a pen and wrote the following, which was\r\ncopied and sent out as Marshal Lamon’s refutation of the shameless\r\nslander:\r\n\r\n“The President has known me intimately for nearly twenty years, and has\r\noften heard me sing little ditties. The battle of Antietam was fought on\r\nthe 17th day of September, 1862. On the first day of October, just\r\ntwo weeks after the battle, the President, with some others, including\r\nmyself, started from Washington to visit the Army, reaching Harper’s\r\nFerry at noon of that day.\r\n\r\n“In a short while General McClellan came from his headquarters near the\r\nbattleground, joined the President, and with him reviewed the troops\r\nat Bolivar Heights that afternoon, and at night returned to his\r\nheadquarters, leaving the President at Harper’s Ferry.\r\n\r\n“On the morning of the second, the President, with General Sumner,\r\nreviewed the troops respectively at Loudon Heights and Maryland Heights,\r\nand at about noon started to General McClellan’s headquarters, reaching\r\nthere only in time to see very little before night.\r\n\r\n“On the morning of the third all started on a review of the Third Corps\r\nand the cavalry, in the vicinity of the Antietam battle-ground. After\r\ngetting through with General Burnside’s corps, at the suggestion of\r\nGeneral McClellan, he and the President left their horses to be led, and\r\nwent into an ambulance to go to General Fitz John Porter’s corps, which\r\nwas two or three miles distant.\r\n\r\n“I am not sure whether the President and General McClellan were in the\r\nsame ambulance, or in different ones; but myself and some others were\r\nin the same with the President. On the way, and on no part of the\r\nbattleground, and on what suggestions I do not remember, the President\r\nasked me to sing the little sad song that follows (“Twenty Years Ago,\r\nTom”), which he had often heard me sing, and had always seemed to like\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\n“After it was over, some one of the party (I do not think it was the\r\nPresident) asked me to sing something else; and I sang two or three\r\nlittle comic things, of which ‘Picayune Butler’ was one. Porter’s corps\r\nwas reached and reviewed; then the battle-ground was passed over, and\r\nthe most noted parts examined; then, in succession, the cavalry and\r\nFranklin’s corps were reviewed, and the President and party returned\r\nto General McClellan’s headquarters at the end of a very hard, hot and\r\ndusty day’s work.\r\n\r\n“Next day (the 4th), the President and General McClellan visited such\r\nof the wounded as still remained in the vicinity, including the\r\nnow lamented General Richardson; then proceeded to and examined the\r\nSouth-Mountain battle-ground, at which point they parted, General\r\nMcClellan returning to his camp, and the President returning to\r\nWashington, seeing, on the way, General Hartsoff, who lay wounded at\r\nFrederick Town.\r\n\r\n“This is the whole story of the singing and its surroundings. Neither\r\nGeneral McClellan nor any one else made any objections to the singing;\r\nthe place was not on the battle-field; the time was sixteen days after\r\nthe battle; no dead body was seen during the whole time the President\r\nwas absent from Washington, nor even a grave that had not been rained on\r\nsince the time it was made.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ONE WAR AT A TIME.”\r\n\r\nNothing in Lincoln’s entire career better illustrated the surprising\r\nresources of his mind than his manner of dealing with “The Trent\r\nAffair.” The readiness and ability with which he met this perilous\r\nemergency, in a field entirely new to his experience, was worthy the\r\nmost accomplished diplomat and statesman. Admirable, also, was his cool\r\ncourage and self-reliance in following a course radically opposed to\r\nthe prevailing sentiment throughout the country and in Congress, and\r\ncontrary to the advice of his own Cabinet.\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Navy Welles hastened to approve officially the act of\r\nCaptain Wilkes in apprehending the Confederate Commissioners Mason and\r\nSlidell, Secretary Stanton publicly applauded, and even Secretary\r\nof State Seward, whose long public career had made him especially\r\nconservative, stated that he was opposed to any concession or surrender\r\nof Mason and Slidell.\r\n\r\nBut Lincoln, with great sagacity, simply said, “One war at a time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN’S LAST PUBLIC ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nThe President made his last public address on the evening of April 11th,\r\n1865, to a gathering at the White House. Said he:\r\n\r\n“We meet this evening not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart.\r\n\r\n“The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the\r\nprincipal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and speedy peace,\r\nwhose joyous expression cannot be restrained.\r\n\r\n“In the midst of this, however, He from whom all blessings flow must not\r\nbe forgotten.\r\n\r\n“Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of rejoicing be\r\noverlooked; their honors must not be parceled out with others.\r\n\r\n“I myself was near the front, and had the high pleasure of transmitting\r\nthe good news to you; but no part of the honor, for plan or execution,\r\nis mine.\r\n\r\n“To General Grant, his skillful officers and brave men, all belongs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO OTHERS LIKE THEM.\r\n\r\nOne day an old lady from the country called on President Lincoln, her\r\ntanned face peering up to his through a pair of spectacles. Her errand\r\nwas to present Mr. Lincoln a pair of stockings of her own make a yard\r\nlong. Kind tears came to his eyes as she spoke to him, and then,\r\nholding the stockings one in each hand, dangling wide apart for\r\ngeneral inspection, he assured her that he should take them with him to\r\nWashington, where (and here his eyes twinkled) he was sure he should not\r\nbe able to find any like them.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of well-known men were in the room with the President\r\nwhen the old lady made her presentation. Among them was George S.\r\nBoutwell, who afterwards became Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe amusement of the company was not at all diminished by Mr. Boutwell’s\r\nremark, that the lady had evidently made a very correct estimate of Mr.\r\nLincoln’s latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASH WAS AT HAND.\r\n\r\nLincoln was appointed postmaster at New Salem by President Jackson. The\r\noffice was given him because everybody liked him, and because he was the\r\nonly man willing to take it who could make out the returns. Lincoln was\r\npleased, because it gave him a chance to read every newspaper taken\r\nin the vicinity. He had never been able to get half the newspapers he\r\nwanted before.\r\n\r\nYears after the postoffice had been discontinued and Lincoln had\r\nbecome a practicing lawyer at Springfield, an agent of the Postoffice\r\nDepartment entered his office and inquired if Abraham Lincoln was\r\nwithin. Lincoln responded to his name, and was informed that the\r\nagent had called to collect the balance due the Department since the\r\ndiscontinuance of the New Salem office.\r\n\r\nA shade of perplexity passed over Lincoln’s face, which did not escape\r\nthe notice of friends present. One of them said at once:\r\n\r\n“Lincoln, if you are in want of money, let us help you.”\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, but suddenly rose, and pulled out from a pile of books\r\na little old trunk, and, returning to the table, asked the agent how\r\nmuch the amount of his debt was.\r\n\r\nThe sum was named, and then Lincoln opened the trunk, pulled out a\r\nlittle package of coin wrapped in a cotton rag, and counted out the\r\nexact sum, amounting to more than seventeen dollars.\r\n\r\nAfter the agent had left the room, he remarked quietly that he had never\r\nused any man’s money but his own. Although this sum had been in his\r\nhands during all those years, he had never regarded it as available,\r\neven for any temporary use of his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWELCOMED THE LITTLE GIRLS.\r\n\r\nAt a Saturday afternoon reception at the White House, many persons\r\nnoticed three little girls, poorly dressed, the children of some\r\nmechanic or laboring man, who had followed the visitors into the White\r\nHouse to gratify their curiosity. They passed around from room to room,\r\nand were hastening through the reception-room, with some trepidation,\r\nwhen the President called to them:\r\n\r\n“Little girls, are you going to pass me without shaking hands?”\r\n\r\nThen he bent his tall, awkward form down, and shook each little girl\r\nwarmly by the hand. Everybody in the apartment was spellbound by the\r\nincident, so simple in itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“DON’T SWAP HORSES”\r\n\r\nUncle Sam was pretty well satisfied with his horse, “Old Abe,” and, as\r\nshown at the Presidential election of 1864, made up his mind to keep\r\nhim, and not “swap” the tried and true animal for a strange one.\r\n“Harper’s Weekly” of November 12th, 1864, had a cartoon which\r\nillustrated how the people of the United States felt about the matter\r\nbetter than anything published at the time. We reproduce it on this\r\npage. Beneath the picture was this text:\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL: “Why don’t you ride the other horse a bit? He’s the best\r\nanimal.” (Pointing to McClellan in the bushes at the rear.)\r\n\r\nBROTHER JONATHAN: “Well, that may be; but the fact is, OLD ABE is just\r\nwhere I can put my finger on him; and as for the other--though they say\r\nhe’s some when out in the scrub yonder--I never know where to find him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOST VALUABLE POLITICAL ATTRIBUTE.\r\n\r\n“One time I remember I asked Mr. Lincoln what attribute he considered\r\nmost valuable to the successful politician,” said Captain T. W. S. Kidd,\r\nof Springfield.\r\n\r\n“He laid his hand on my shoulder and said, very earnestly:\r\n\r\n“‘To be able to raise a cause which shall produce an effect, and then\r\nfight the effect.’\r\n\r\n“The more you think about it, the more profound does it become.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” RESENTED THE INSULT.\r\n\r\nA cashiered officer, seeking to be restored through the power of the\r\nexecutive, became insolent, because the President, who believed the man\r\nguilty, would not accede to his repeated requests, at last said, “Well,\r\nMr. President, I see you are fully determined not to do me justice!”\r\n\r\nThis was too aggravating even for Mr. Lincoln; rising he suddenly seized\r\nthe disgraced officer by the coat collar, and marched him forcibly to\r\nthe door, saying as he ejected him into the passage:\r\n\r\n“Sir, I give you fair warning never to show your face in this room\r\nagain. I can bear censure, but not insult. I never wish to see your face\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE MAN ISN’T MISSED.\r\n\r\nSalmon P. Chase, when Secretary of the Treasury, had a disagreement with\r\nother members of the Cabinet, and resigned.\r\n\r\nThe President was urged not to accept it, as “Secretary Chase is to-day\r\na national necessity,” his advisers said.\r\n\r\n“How mistaken you are!” Lincoln quietly observed. “Yet it is not\r\nstrange; I used to have similar notions. No! If we should all be turned\r\nout to-morrow, and could come back here in a week, we should find our\r\nplaces filled by a lot of fellows doing just as well as we did, and in\r\nmany instances better.\r\n\r\n“Now, this reminds me of what the Irishman said. His verdict was that\r\n‘in this country one man is as good as another; and, for the matter\r\nof that, very often a great deal better.’ No; this Government does not\r\ndepend upon the life of any man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“STRETCHED THE FACTS.”\r\n\r\nGeorge B. Lincoln, a prominent merchant of Brooklyn, was traveling\r\nthrough the West in 1855-56, and found himself one night in a town on\r\nthe Illinois River, by the name of Naples. The only tavern of the place\r\nhad evidently been constructed with reference to business on a small\r\nscale. Poor as the prospect seemed, Mr. Lincoln had no alternative but\r\nto put up at the place.\r\n\r\nThe supper-room was also used as a lodging-room. Mr. Lincoln told his\r\nhost that he thought he would “go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Bed!” echoed the landlord. “There is no bed for you in this house\r\nunless you sleep with that man yonder. He has the only one we have to\r\nspare.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” returned Mr. Lincoln, “the gentleman has possession, and perhaps\r\nwould not like a bed-fellow.”\r\n\r\nUpon this a grizzly head appeared out of the pillows, and said:\r\n\r\n“What is your name?”\r\n\r\n“They call me Lincoln at home,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Lincoln!” repeated the stranger; “any connection of our Illinois\r\nAbraham?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Mr. Lincoln. “I fear not.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the old gentleman, “I will let any man by the name of\r\n‘Lincoln’ sleep with me, just for the sake of the name. You have heard\r\nof Abe?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, very often,” replied Mr. Lincoln. “No man could travel far\r\nin this State without hearing of him, and I would be very glad to claim\r\nconnection if I could do so honestly.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the old gentleman, “my name is Simmons. ‘Abe’ and I used\r\nto live and work together when young men. Many a job of woodcutting and\r\nrail-splitting have I done up with him. Abe Lincoln was the likeliest\r\nboy in God’s world. He would work all day as hard as any of us and study\r\nby firelight in the log-house half the night; and in this way he made\r\nhimself a thorough, practical surveyor. Once, during those days, I was\r\nin the upper part of the State, and I met General Ewing, whom President\r\nJackson had sent to the Northwest to make surveys. I told him about Abe\r\nLincoln, what a student he was, and that I wanted he should give him a\r\njob. He looked over his memorandum, and, holding out a paper, said:\r\n\r\n“‘There is County must be surveyed; if your friend can do the work\r\nproperly, I shall be glad to have him undertake it--the compensation\r\nwill be six hundred dollars.’\r\n\r\n“Pleased as I could be, I hastened to Abe, after I got home, with an\r\naccount of what I had secured for him. He was sitting before the fire\r\nin the log-cabin when I told him; and what do you think was his answer?\r\nWhen I finished, he looked up very quietly, and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Simmons, I thank you very sincerely for your kindness, but I don’t\r\nthink I will undertake the job.’\r\n\r\n“‘In the name of wonder,’ said I, ‘why? Six hundred does not grow upon\r\nevery bush out here in Illinois.’\r\n\r\n“‘I know that,’ said Abe, ‘and I need the money bad enough, Simmons,\r\nas you know; but I have never been under obligation to a Democratic\r\nAdministration, and I never intend to be so long as I can get my living\r\nanother way. General Ewing must find another man to do his work.’”\r\n\r\nA friend related this story to the President one day, and asked him if\r\nit were true.\r\n\r\n“Pollard Simmons!” said Lincoln. “Well do I remember him. It is correct\r\nabout our working together, but the old man must have stretched the\r\nfacts somewhat about the survey of the county. I think I should have\r\nbeen very glad of the job at the time, no matter what Administration was\r\nin power.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT LENGTHENED THE WAR.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln said, long before the National political campaign of\r\n1864 had opened:\r\n\r\n“If the unworthy ambition of politicians and the jealousy that exists in\r\nthe army could be repressed, and all unite in a common aim and a common\r\nendeavor, the rebellion would soon be crushed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS THEORY OF THE REBELLION.\r\n\r\nThe President once explained to a friend the theory of the Rebellion by\r\nthe aid of the maps before him.\r\n\r\nRunning his long fore-finger down the map, he stopped at Virginia.\r\n\r\n“We must drive them away from here” (Manassas Gap), he said, “and clear\r\nthem out of this part of the State so that they cannot threaten us here\r\n(Washington) and get into Maryland.\r\n\r\n“We must keep up a good and thorough blockade of their ports. We must\r\nmarch an army into East Tennessee and liberate the Union sentiment\r\nthere. Finally we must rely on the people growing tired and saying to\r\ntheir leaders, ‘We have had enough of this thing, we will bear it no\r\nlonger.’”\r\n\r\nSuch was President Lincoln’s plan for heading off the Rebellion in the\r\nsummer of 1861. How it enlarged as the War progressed, from a call for\r\nseventy thousand volunteers to one for five hundred thousand men and\r\n$500,000,000 is a matter of well-known history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAN AWAY WHEN VICTORIOUS.\r\n\r\nThree or four days after the battle of Bull Run, some gentlemen who had\r\nbeen on the field called upon the President.\r\n\r\nHe inquired very minutely regarding all the circumstances of the affair,\r\nand, after listening with the utmost attention, said, with a touch of\r\nhumor: “So it is your notion that we whipped the rebels and then ran\r\naway from them!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED STANTON SPANKED.\r\n\r\nOld Dennis Hanks was sent to Washington at one time by persons\r\ninterested in securing the release from jail of several men accused of\r\nbeing copperheads. It was thought Old Dennis might have some influence\r\nwith the President.\r\n\r\nThe latter heard Dennis’ story and then said: “I will send for Mr.\r\nStanton. It is his business.”\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton came into the room, stormed up and down, and said the\r\nmen ought to be punished more than they were. Mr. Lincoln sat quietly in\r\nhis chair and waited for the tempest to subside, and then quietly said\r\nto Stanton he would like to have the papers next day.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Dennis said:\r\n\r\n“‘Abe,’ if I was as big and as ugly as you are, I would take him over my\r\nknee and spank him.”\r\n\r\nThe President replied: “No, Stanton is an able and valuable man for this\r\nNation, and I am glad to bear his anger for the service he can give the\r\nNation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANTON WAS OUT OF TOWN.\r\n\r\nThe quaint remark of the President to an applicant, “My dear sir, I have\r\nnot much influence with the Administration,” was one of Lincoln’s little\r\njokes.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton, Secretary of War, once replied to an order from the\r\nPresident to give a colonel a commission in place of the resigning\r\nbrigadier:\r\n\r\n“I shan’t do it, sir! I shan’t do it! It isn’t the way to do it, sir,\r\nand I shan’t do it. I don’t propose to argue the question with you,\r\nsir.”\r\n\r\nA few days after, the friend of the applicant who had presented the\r\norder to Secretary Stanton called upon the President and related his\r\nreception. A look of vexation came over the face of the President, and\r\nhe seemed unwilling to talk of it, and desired the friend to see him\r\nanother day. He did so, when he gave his visitor a positive order for\r\nthe promotion. The latter told him he would not speak to Secretary\r\nStanton again until he apologized.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said the President, “Stanton has gone to Fortress Monroe, and Dana\r\nis acting. He will attend to it for you.”\r\n\r\nThis he said with a manner of relief, as if it was a piece of good luck\r\nto find a man there who would obey his orders.\r\n\r\nThe nomination was sent to the Senate and confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTIFIED THE COLORED MAN.\r\n\r\nMany applications reached Lincoln as he passed to and from the White\r\nHouse and the War Department. One day as he crossed the park he was\r\nstopped by a negro, who told him a pitiful story. The President wrote\r\nhim out a check, which read. “Pay to colored man with one leg five\r\ndollars.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICE SEEKERS WORSE THAN WAR.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republican party came into power, Washington swarmed with\r\noffice-seekers. They overran the White House and gave the President\r\ngreat annoyance. The incongruity of a man in his position, and with\r\nthe very life of the country at stake, pausing to appoint postmasters,\r\nstruck Mr. Lincoln forcibly. “What is the matter, Mr. Lincoln,” said\r\na friend one day, when he saw him looking particularly grave and\r\ndispirited. “Has anything gone wrong at the front?” “No,” said the\r\nPresident, with a tired smile. “It isn’t the war; it’s the postoffice at\r\nBrownsville, Missouri.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE “SET ‘EM UP.”\r\n\r\nImmediately after Mr. Lincoln’s nomination for President at the Chicago\r\nConvention, a committee, of which Governor Morgan, of New York, was\r\nchairman, visited him in Springfield, Ill., where he was officially\r\ninformed of his nomination.\r\n\r\nAfter this ceremony had passed, Mr. Lincoln remarked to the company that\r\nas a fit ending to an interview so important and interesting as that\r\nwhich had just taken place, he supposed good manners would require that\r\nhe should treat the committee with something to drink; and opening\r\nthe door that led into the rear, he called out, “Mary! Mary!” A girl\r\nresponded to the call, to whom Mr. Lincoln spoke a few words in an\r\nundertone, and, closing the door, returned again and talked with his\r\nguests. In a few minutes the maid entered, bearing a large waiter,\r\ncontaining several glass tumblers, and a large pitcher, and placed them\r\nupon the center-table. Mr. Lincoln arose, and, gravely addressing the\r\ncompany, said: “Gentlemen, we must pledge our mutual health in the most\r\nhealthy beverage that God has given to man--it is the only beverage I\r\nhave ever used or allowed my family to use, and I cannot conscientiously\r\ndepart from it on the present occasion. It is pure Adam’s ale from the\r\nspring.” And, taking the tumbler, he touched it to his lips, and pledged\r\nthem his highest respects in a cup of cold water. Of course, all his\r\nguests admired his consistency, and joined in his example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASN’T STANTON’S SAY.\r\n\r\nA few days before the President’s death, Secretary Stanton tendered\r\nhis resignation as Secretary of War. He accompanied the act with a most\r\nheartfelt tribute to Mr. Lincoln’s constant friendship and faithful\r\ndevotion to the country, saying, also, that he, as Secretary, had\r\naccepted the position to hold it only until the war should end, and that\r\nnow he felt his work was done, and his duty was to resign.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was greatly moved by the Secretary’s words, and, tearing in\r\npieces the paper containing the resignation, and throwing his arms about\r\nthe Secretary, he said:\r\n\r\n“Stanton, you have been a good friend and a faithful public servant, and\r\nit is not for you to say when you will no longer be needed here.”\r\n\r\nSeveral friends of both parties were present on the occasion, and there\r\nwas not a dry eye that witnessed the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“JEFFY” THREW UP THE SPONGE.\r\n\r\nWhen the War was fairly on, many people were astonished to find that\r\n“Old Abe” was a fighter from “way back.” No one was the victim of\r\ngreater amazement than Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate\r\nStates of America. Davis found out that “Abe” was not only a hard\r\nhitter, but had staying qualities of a high order. It was a fight to\r\na “finish” with “Abe,” no compromises being accepted. Over the title,\r\n“North and South,” the issue of “Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper”\r\n of December 24th, 1864, contained the cartoon, see reproduce on this\r\npage. Underneath the picture were the lines:\r\n\r\n“Now, Jeffy, when you think you have had enough of this, say so, and\r\nI’ll leave off.” (See President’s message.) In his message to Congress,\r\nDecember 6th,\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln said: “No attempt at negotiation with the insurgent\r\nleader could result in any good. He would accept of nothing short of the\r\nseverance of the Union.”\r\n\r\nTherefore, Father Abraham, getting “Jeffy’s” head “in chancery,”\r\n proceeded to change the appearance and size of the secessionist’s\r\ncountenance, much to the grief and discomfort of the Southerner. It was\r\nLincoln’s idea to re-establish the Union, and he carried out his purpose\r\nto the very letter. But he didn’t “leave off” until “Jeffy” cried\r\n“enough.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDN’T KNOW GRANT’S PREFERENCE.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1864, President Lincoln, while he knew his re-election to\r\nthe White House was in no sense doubtful, knew that if he lost New\r\nYork and with it Pennsylvania on the home vote, the moral effect of\r\nhis triumph would be broken and his power to prosecute the war and make\r\npeace would be greatly impaired. Colonel A. K. McClure was with Lincoln\r\na good deal of the time previous to the November election, and tells\r\nthis story:\r\n\r\n“His usually sad face was deeply shadowed with sorrow when I told him\r\nthat I saw no reasonable prospect of carrying Pennsylvania on the home\r\nvote, although we had about held our own in the hand-to-hand conflict\r\nthrough which we were passing.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, what is to be done?’ was Lincoln’s inquiry, after the whole\r\nsituation had been presented to him. I answered that the solution of the\r\nproblem was a very simple and easy one--that Grant was idle in front of\r\nPetersburg; that Sheridan had won all possible victories in the Valley;\r\nand that if five thousand Pennsylvania soldiers could be furloughed home\r\nfrom each army, the election could be carried without doubt.\r\n\r\n“Lincoln’s face’ brightened instantly at the suggestion, and I saw that\r\nhe was quite ready to execute it. I said to him: ‘Of course, you can\r\ntrust want to make the suggestion to him to furlough five thousand\r\nPennsylvania troops for two weeks?’\r\n\r\n“‘To my surprise, Lincoln made no answer, and the bright face of a few\r\nmoments before was instantly shadowed again. I was much disconcerted,\r\nas I supposed that Grant was the one man to whom Lincoln could turn with\r\nabsolute confidence as his friend. I then said, with some earnestness:\r\n‘Surely, Mr. President, you can trust Grant with a confidential\r\nsuggestion to furlough Pennsylvania troops?’\r\n\r\n“Lincoln remained silent and evidently distressed at the proposition I\r\nwas pressing upon him. After a few moments, and speaking with emphasis,\r\nI said: ‘It can’t be possible that Grant is not your friend; he can’t be\r\nsuch an ingrate?’\r\n\r\n“Lincoln hesitated for some time, and then answered in these words:\r\n‘Well, McClure, I have no reason to believe that Grant prefers my\r\nelection to that of McClellan.’\r\n\r\n“I believe Lincoln was mistaken in his distrust of Grant.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE vs. NUMBERS.\r\n\r\nLincoln was constantly bothered by members of delegations of\r\n“goody-goodies,” who knew all about running the War, but had no inside\r\ninformation as to what was going on. Yet, they poured out their advice\r\nin streams, until the President was heartily sick of the whole business,\r\nand wished the War would find some way to kill off these nuisances.\r\n\r\n“How many men have the Confederates now in the field?” asked one of\r\nthese bores one day.\r\n\r\n“About one million two hundred thousand,” replied the President.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my! Not so many as that, surely, Mr. Lincoln.”\r\n\r\n“They have fully twelve hundred thousand, no doubt of it. You see, all\r\nof our generals when they get whipped say the enemy outnumbers them\r\nfrom three or five to one, and I must believe them. We have four hundred\r\nthousand men in the field, and three times four make twelve,--don’t you\r\nsee it? It is as plain to be seen as the nose on a man’s face; and at\r\nthe rate things are now going, with the great amount of speculation and\r\nthe small crop of fighting, it will take a long time to overcome twelve\r\nhundred thousand rebels in arms.\r\n\r\n“If they can get subsistence they have everything else, except a just\r\ncause. Yet it is said that ‘thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel\r\njust.’ I am willing, however, to risk our advantage of thrice in justice\r\nagainst their thrice in numbers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO FALSE PRIDE IN LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan had little or no conception of the greatness of\r\nAbraham Lincoln. As time went on, he began to show plainly his contempt\r\nof the President, frequently allowing him to wait in the ante-room of\r\nhis house while he transacted business with others. This discourtesy was\r\nso open that McClellan’s staff noticed it, and newspaper correspondents\r\ncommented on it. The President was too keen not to see the situation,\r\nbut he was strong enough to ignore it. It was a battle he wanted from\r\nMcClellan, not deference.\r\n\r\n“I will hold McClellan’s horse, if he will only bring us success,” he\r\nsaid one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRA MEMBER OF THE CABINET.\r\n\r\nG. H. Giddings was selected as the bearer of a message from the\r\nPresident to Governor Sam Houston, of Texas. A conflict had arisen there\r\nbetween the Southern party and the Governor, Sam Houston, and on March\r\n18 the latter had been deposed. When Mr. Lincoln heard of this, he\r\ndecided to try to get a message to the Governor, offering United States\r\nsupport if he would put himself at the head of the Union party of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nMr. Giddings thus told of his interview with the President:\r\n\r\n“He said to me that the message was of such importance that, before\r\nhanding it to me, he would read it to me. Before beginning to read he\r\nsaid, ‘This is a confidential and secret message. No one besides my\r\nCabinet and myself knows anything about it, and we are all sworn to\r\nsecrecy. I am going to swear you in as one of my Cabinet.’\r\n\r\n“And then he said to me in a jocular way, ‘Hold up your right hand,’\r\nwhich I did.\r\n\r\n“‘Now,’ said he, consider yourself a member of my Cabinet.”’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LINCOLN WAS ABUSED.\r\n\r\nWith the possible exception of President Washington, whose political\r\nopponents did not hesitate to rob the vocabulary of vulgarity and\r\nwickedness whenever they desired to vilify the Chief Magistrate, Lincoln\r\nwas the most and “best” abused man who ever held office in the United\r\nStates. During the first half of his initial term there was no epithet\r\nwhich was not applied to him.\r\n\r\nOne newspaper in New York habitually characterized him as “that hideous\r\nbaboon at the other end of the avenue,” and declared that “Barnum should\r\nbuy and exhibit him as a zoological curiosity.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the President did not, to all appearances, exhibit annoyance\r\nbecause of the various diatribes printed and spoken, yet the fact is\r\nthat his life was so cruelly embittered by these and other expressions\r\nquite as virulent, that he often declared to those most intimate with\r\nhim, “I would rather be dead than, as President, thus abused in the\r\nhouse of my friends.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW “FIGHTING JOE” WAS APPOINTED.\r\n\r\nGeneral “Joe” Hooker, the fourth commander of the noble but unfortunate\r\nArmy of the Potomac, was appointed to that position by President Lincoln\r\nin January, 1863. General Scott, for some reason, disliked Hooker\r\nand would not appoint him. Hooker, after some months of discouraging\r\nwaiting, decided to return to California, and called to pay his respects\r\nto President Lincoln. He was introduced as Captain Hooker, and to the\r\nsurprise of the President began the following speech:\r\n\r\n“Mr. President, my friend makes a mistake. I am not Captain Hooker, but\r\nwas once Lieutenant-Colonel Hooker of the regular army. I was lately\r\na farmer in California, but since the Rebellion broke out I have been\r\ntrying to get into service, but I find I am not wanted.\r\n\r\n“I am about to return home; but before going, I was anxious to pay my\r\nrespects to you, and express my wishes for your personal welfare and\r\nsuccess in quelling this Rebellion. And I want to say to you a word\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“I was at Bull Run the other day, Mr. President, and it is no vanity\r\nin me to say, I am a darned sight better general than you had on the\r\nfield.”\r\n\r\nThis was said, not in the tone of a braggart, but of a man who knew what\r\nhe was talking about. Hooker did not return to California, but in a\r\nfew weeks Captain Hooker received from the President a commission as\r\nBrigadier-General Hooker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEPT HIS COURAGE UP.\r\n\r\nThe President, like old King Saul, when his term was about to expire,\r\nwas in a quandary concerning a further lease of the Presidential office.\r\nHe consulted again the “prophetess” of Georgetown, immortalized by his\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\nShe retired to an inner chamber, and, after raising and consulting more\r\nthan a dozen of distinguished spirits from Hades, she returned to the\r\nreception-parlor, where the chief magistrate awaited her, and declared\r\nthat General Grant would capture Richmond, and that “Honest Old Abe”\r\n would be next President.\r\n\r\nShe, however, as the report goes, told him to beware of Chase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FORTUNE-TELLER’S PREDICTION.\r\n\r\nLincoln had been born and reared among people who were believers in\r\npremonitions and supernatural appearances all his life, and he once\r\ndeclared to his friends that he was “from boyhood superstitious.”\r\n\r\nHe at one time said to Judge Arnold that “the near approach of the\r\nimportant events of his life were indicated by a presentiment or a\r\nstrange dream, or in some other mysterious way it was impressed upon him\r\nthat something important was to occur.” This was earlier than 1850.\r\n\r\nIt is said that on his second visit to New Orleans, Lincoln and his\r\ncompanion, John Hanks, visited an old fortune-teller--a voodoo negress.\r\nTradition says that “during the interview she became very much excited,\r\nand after various predictions, exclaimed: ‘You will be President, and\r\nall the negroes will be free.’”\r\n\r\nThat the old voodoo negress should have foretold that the visitor would\r\nbe President is not at all incredible. She doubtless told this to many\r\naspiring lads, but Lincoln, so it is avowed took the prophecy seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO MUCH POWDER.\r\n\r\nSo great was Lincoln’s anxiety for the success of the Union arms that he\r\nconsidered no labor on his part too arduous, and spent much of his time\r\nin looking after even the small details.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren was sent for one morning by the President, who said\r\n“Well, captain, here’s a letter about some new powder.”\r\n\r\nAfter reading the letter he showed the sample of powder, and remarked\r\nthat he had burned some of it, and did not believe it was a good\r\narticle--here was too much residuum.\r\n\r\n“I will show you,” he said; and getting a small piece of paper, placed\r\nthereupon some of the powder, then went to the fire and with the tongs\r\npicked up a coal, which he blew, clapped it on the powder, and after the\r\nresulting explosion, added, “You see there is too much left there.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLEEP STANDING UP.\r\n\r\nMcClellan was a thorn in Lincoln’s side--“always up in the air,” as\r\nthe President put it--and yet he hesitated to remove him. “The Young\r\nNapoleon” was a good organizer, but no fighter. Lincoln sent him\r\neverything necessary in the way of men, ammunition, artillery and\r\nequipments, but he was forever unready.\r\n\r\nInstead of making a forward movement at the time expected, he would\r\nnotify the President that he must have more men. These were given him as\r\nrapidly as possible, and then would come a demand for more horses, more\r\nthis and that, usually winding up with a demand for still “more men.”\r\n\r\nLincoln bore it all in patience for a long time, but one day, when he\r\nhad received another request for more men, he made a vigorous protest.\r\n\r\n“If I gave McClellan all the men he asks for,” said the President, “they\r\ncouldn’t find room to lie down. They’d have to sleep standing up.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULD HAVE FOUGHT ANOTHER BATTLE.\r\n\r\nGeneral Meade, after the great victory at Gettysburg, was again face to\r\nface with General Lee shortly afterwards at Williamsport, and even the\r\nformer’s warmest friends agree that he might have won in another battle,\r\nbut he took no action. He was not a “pushing” man like Grant. It\r\nwas this negligence on the part of Meade that lost him the rank of\r\nLieutenant-General, conferred upon General Sheridan.\r\n\r\nA friend of Meade’s, speaking to President Lincoln and intimating that\r\nMeade should have, after that battle, been made Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Union Armies, received this reply from Lincoln:\r\n\r\n“Now, don’t misunderstand me about General Meade. I am profoundly\r\ngrateful down to the bottom of my boots for what he did at Gettysburg,\r\nbut I think that if I had been General Meade I would have fought another\r\nbattle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN UPBRAIDED LAMON.\r\n\r\nIn one of his reminiscences of Lincoln, Ward Lamon tells how keenly the\r\nPresident-elect always regretted the “sneaking in act” when he made the\r\ncelebrated “midnight ride,” which he took under protest, and landed him\r\nin Washington known to but a few. Lamon says:\r\n\r\n“The President was convinced that he committed a grave mistake in\r\nlistening to the solicitations of a ‘professional spy’ and of friends\r\ntoo easily alarmed, and frequently upbraided me for having aided him\r\nto degrade himself at the very moment in all his life when his behavior\r\nshould have exhibited the utmost dignity and composure.\r\n\r\n“Neither he nor the country generally then understood the true facts\r\nconcerning the dangers to his life. It is now an acknowledged fact that\r\nthere never was a moment from the day he crossed the Maryland line, up\r\nto the time of his assassination, that he was not in danger of death by\r\nviolence, and that his life was spared until the night of the 14th of\r\nApril, 1865, only through the ceaseless and watchful care of the guards\r\nthrown around him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKED OUT A FEW WORDS.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was calm and unmoved when England and France were\r\nblustering and threatening war. At Lincoln’s instance Secretary of State\r\nSeward notified the English Cabinet and the French Emperor that as\r\nours was merely a family quarrel of a strictly private and confidential\r\nnature, there was no call for meddling; also that they would have a war\r\non their hands in a very few minutes if they didn’t keep their hands\r\noff.\r\n\r\nMany of Seward’s notes were couched in decidedly peppery terms, some\r\nexpressions being so tart that President Lincoln ran his pen through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN SILENCES SEWARD.\r\n\r\nGeneral Farnsworth told the writer nearly twenty years ago that, being\r\nin the War Office one day, Secretary Stanton told him that at the last\r\nCabinet meeting he had learned a lesson he should never forget, and\r\nthought he had obtained an insight into Mr. Lincoln’s wonderful power\r\nover the masses. The Secretary said a Cabinet meeting was called to\r\nconsider our relations with England in regard to the Mason-Slidell\r\naffair. One after another of the Cabinet presented his views, and Mr.\r\nSeward read an elaborate diplomatic dispatch, which he had prepared.\r\n\r\nFinally Mr. Lincoln read what he termed “a few brief remarks upon the\r\nsubject,” and asked the opinions of his auditors. They unanimously\r\nagreed that our side of the question needed no more argument than was\r\ncontained in the President’s “few brief remarks.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seward said he would be glad to adopt the remarks, and, giving them\r\nmore of the phraseology usual in diplomatic circles, send them to Lord\r\nPalmerston, the British premier.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Secretary Stanton, “came the demonstration. The President,\r\nhalf wheeling in his seat, threw one leg over the chair-arm, and,\r\nholding the letter in his hand, said, ‘Seward, do you suppose Palmerston\r\nwill understand our position from that letter, just as it is?’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly, Mr. President.’\r\n\r\n“‘Do you suppose the London Times will?’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly.’\r\n\r\n“‘Do you suppose the average Englishman of affairs will?’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly; it cannot be mistaken in England.’\r\n\r\n“‘Do you suppose that a hackman out on his box (pointing to the street)\r\nwill understand it?’\r\n\r\n“‘Very readily, Mr. President.’\r\n\r\n“‘Very well, Seward, I guess we’ll let her slide just as she is.’\r\n\r\n“And the letter did ‘slide,’ and settled the whole business in a manner\r\nthat was effective.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROUGHT THE HUSBAND UP.\r\n\r\nOne morning President Lincoln asked Major Eckert, on duty at the White\r\nHouse, “Who is that woman crying out in the hall? What is the matter\r\nwith her?”\r\n\r\nEckert said it was a woman who had come a long distance expecting to go\r\ndown to the army to see her husband. An order had gone out a short time\r\nbefore to allow no women in the army, except in special cases.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln sat moodily for a moment after hearing this story, and\r\nsuddenly looking up, said, “Let’s send her down. You write the order,\r\nMajor.”\r\n\r\nMajor Eckert hesitated a moment, and replied, “Would it not be better\r\nfor Colonel Hardie to write the order?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Lincoln, “that is better; let Hardie write it.”\r\n\r\nThe major went out, and soon returned, saying, “Mr. President, would\r\nit not be better in this case to let the woman’s husband come to\r\nWashington?”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s face lighted up with pleasure. “Yes, yes,” was the\r\nPresident’s answer in a relieved tone; “that’s the best way; bring him\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nThe order was written, and the man was sent to Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO WAR WITHOUT BLOOD-LETTING.\r\n\r\n“You can’t carry on war without blood-letting,” said Lincoln one day.\r\n\r\nThe President, although almost feminine in his kind-heartedness, knew\r\nnot only this, but also that large bodies of soldiers in camp were at\r\nthe mercy of diseases of every sort, the result being a heavy casualty\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nOf the (estimated) half-million men of the Union armies who gave up\r\ntheir lives in the War of the Rebellion--1861-65--fully seventy-five\r\nper cent died of disease. The soldiers killed upon the field of battle\r\nconstituted a comparatively small proportion of the casualties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S TWO DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\nLondon “Punch” caricatured President Lincoln in every possible way,\r\nholding him and the Union cause up to the ridicule of the world so far\r\nas it could. On August 23rd, 1862, its cartoon entitled “Lincoln’s Two\r\nDifficulties” had the text underneath: LINCOLN: “What? No money! No\r\nmen!” “Punch” desired to create the impression that the Washington\r\nGovernment was in a bad way, lacking both money and men for the purpose\r\nof putting down the Rebellion; that the United States Treasury was\r\nbankrupt, and the people of the North so devoid of patriotism that they\r\nwould not send men for the army to assist in destroying the Confederacy.\r\nThe truth is, that when this cartoon was printed the North had five\r\nhundred thousand men in the field, and, before the War closed, had\r\nprovided fully two million and a half troops. The report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury which showed the financial affairs and\r\nsituation of the United States up to July, 1862. The receipts of\r\nthe National Government for the year ending June 30th, 1862, were\r\n$10,000,000 in excess of the expenditures, although the War was costing\r\nthe country $2,000,000 per day; the credit of the United States was\r\ngood, and business matters were in a satisfactory state. The Navy, by\r\nAugust 23rd, 1862, had received eighteen thousand additional men,\r\nand was in fine shape; the people of the North stood ready to supply\r\nanything the Government needed, so that, all things taken together, the\r\n“Punch” cartoon was not exactly true, as the facts and figures\r\nabundantly proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ELEPHANT ON HIS HANDS.\r\n\r\nAn old and intimate friend from Springfield called on President Lincoln\r\nand found him much depressed.\r\n\r\nThe President was reclining on a sofa, but rising suddenly he said to\r\nhis friend:\r\n\r\n“You know better than any man living that from my boyhood up my ambition\r\nwas to be President. I am President of one part of this divided country\r\nat least; but look at me! Oh, I wish I had never been born!\r\n\r\n“I’ve a white elephant on my hands--one hard to manage. With a fire\r\nin my front and rear to contend with, the jealousies of the military\r\ncommanders, and not receiving that cordial co-operative support from\r\nCongress that could reasonably be expected with an active and formidable\r\nenemy in the field threatening the very life-blood of the Government, my\r\nposition is anything but a bed of roses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN LINCOLN AND GRANT CLASHED.\r\n\r\nWard Lamon, one of President Lincoln’s law partners, and his most\r\nintimate friend in Washington, has this to relate:\r\n\r\n“I am not aware that there was ever a serious discord or\r\nmisunderstanding between Mr. Lincoln and General Grant, except on a\r\nsingle occasion. From the commencement of the struggle, Lincoln’s policy\r\nwas to break the backbone of the Confederacy by depriving it of its\r\nprincipal means of subsistence.\r\n\r\n“Cotton was its vital aliment; deprive it of this, and the rebellion\r\nmust necessarily collapse. The Hon. Elihu B. Washburne from the outset\r\nwas opposed to any contraband traffic with the Confederates.\r\n\r\n“Lincoln had given permits and passes through the lines to two\r\npersons--Mr. Joseph Mattox of Maryland and General Singleton of\r\nIllinois--to enable them to bring cotton and other Southern products\r\nfrom Virginia. Washburne heard of it, called immediately on Mr. Lincoln,\r\nand, after remonstrating with him on the impropriety of such a demarche,\r\nthreatened to have General Grant countermand the permits if they were\r\nnot revoked.\r\n\r\n“Naturally, both became excited. Lincoln declared that he did not\r\nbelieve General Grant would take upon himself the responsibility of such\r\nan act. ‘I will show you, sir; I will show you whether Grant will do it\r\nor not,’ responded Mr. Washburne, as he abruptly withdrew.\r\n\r\n“By the next boat, subsequent to this interview, the Congressman left\r\nWashington for the headquarters of General Grant. He returned shortly\r\nafterward to the city, and so likewise did Mattox and Singleton. Grant\r\nhad countermanded the permits.\r\n\r\n“Under all the circumstances, it was, naturally, a source of exultation\r\nto Mr. Washburne and his friends, and of corresponding surprise and\r\nmortification to the President. The latter, however, said nothing\r\nfurther than this:\r\n\r\n“‘I wonder when General Grant changed his mind on this subject? He was\r\nthe first man, after the commencement of this War, to grant a permit for\r\nthe passage of cotton through the lines, and that to his own father.’\r\n\r\n“The President, however, never showed any resentment toward General\r\nGrant.\r\n\r\n“In referring afterwards to the subject, the President said: ‘It made\r\nme feel my insignificance keenly at the moment; but if my friends\r\nWashburne, Henry Wilson and others derive pleasure from so unworthy a\r\nvictory over me, I leave them to its full enjoyment.’\r\n\r\n“This ripple on the otherwise unruffled current of their intercourse did\r\nnot disturb the personal relations between Lincoln and Grant; but there\r\nwas little cordiality between the President and Messrs. Washburne and\r\nWilson afterwards.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWON JAMES GORDON BENNETT’S SUPPORT.\r\n\r\nThe story as to how President Lincoln won the support of James Gordon\r\nBennett, Sr., founder of the New York Herald, is a most interesting one.\r\nIt was one of Lincoln’s shrewdest political acts, and was brought about\r\nby the tender, in an autograph letter, of the French Mission to Bennett.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times was the only paper in the metropolis which supported\r\nhim heartily, and President Lincoln knew how important it was to have\r\nthe support of the Herald. He therefore, according to the way Colonel\r\nMcClure tells it, carefully studied how to bring its editor into close\r\ntouch with himself.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for Lincoln’s re-election was not promising. Bennett had\r\nstrongly advocated the nomination of General McClellan by the Democrats,\r\nand that was ominous of hostility to Lincoln; and when McClellan was\r\nnominated he was accepted on all sides as a most formidable candidate.\r\n\r\nIt was in this emergency that Lincoln’s political sagacity served him\r\nsufficiently to win the Herald to his cause, and it was done by the\r\nconfidential tender of the French Mission. Bennett did not break over to\r\nLincoln at once, but he went by gradual approaches.\r\n\r\nHis first step was to declare in favor of an entirely new candidate,\r\nwhich was an utter impossibility. He opened a “leader” in the Herald on\r\nthe subject in this way: “Lincoln has proved a failure; McClellan\r\nhas proved a failure; Fremont has proved a failure; let us have a new\r\ncandidate.”\r\n\r\nLincoln, McClellan and Fremont were then all in the field as nominated\r\ncandidates, and the Fremont defection was a serious threat to Lincoln.\r\nOf course, neither Lincoln nor McClellan declined, and the Herald,\r\nfailing to get the new man it knew to be an impossibility, squarely\r\nadvocated Lincoln’s re-election.\r\n\r\nWithout consulting any one, and without any public announcement:\r\nwhatever, Lincoln wrote to Bennett, asking him to accept the mission to\r\nFrance. The offer was declined. Bennett valued the offer very much more\r\nthan the office, and from that day until the day of the President’s\r\ndeath he was one of Lincoln’s most appreciative friends and hearty\r\nsupporters on his own independent line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOOD BY THE “SILENT MAN.”\r\n\r\nOnce, in reply to a delegation, which visited the White House, the\r\nmembers of which were unusually vociferous in their demands that the\r\nSilent Man (as General Grant was called) should be relieved from duty,\r\nthe President remarked:\r\n\r\n“What I want and what the people want is generals who will fight battles\r\nand win victories.\r\n\r\n“Grant has done this, and I propose to stand by him.”\r\n\r\nThis declaration found its way into the newspapers, and Lincoln was\r\nupheld by the people of the North, who, also, wanted “generals who will\r\nfight battles and win victories.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY BRAINY NUBBIN.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward met Alexander H.\r\nStephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy, on February 2nd, 1865, on\r\nthe River Queen, at Fortress Monroe. Stephens was enveloped in overcoats\r\nand shawls, and had the appearance of a fair-sized man. He began to take\r\noff one wrapping after another, until the small, shriveled old man stood\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nLincoln quietly said to Seward: “This is the largest shucking for so\r\nsmall a nubbin that I ever saw.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln had a friendly conference, but presented his ultimatum\r\nthat the one and only condition of peace was that Confederates “must\r\ncease their resistance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENT TO HIS “FRIENDS.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War, Clement L. Vallandigham, of Ohio, had shown\r\nhimself, in the National House of Representatives and elsewhere, one\r\nof the bitterest and most outspoken of all the men of that class which\r\ninsisted that “the war was a failure.” He declared that it was the\r\ndesign of “those in power to establish a despotism,” and that they had\r\n“no intention of restoring the Union.” He denounced the conscription\r\nwhich had been ordered, and declared that men who submitted to be\r\ndrafted into the army were “unworthy to be called free men.” He spoke of\r\nthe President as “King Lincoln.”\r\n\r\nSuch utterances at this time, when the Government was exerting itself to\r\nthe utmost to recruit the armies, were dangerous, and Vallandigham was\r\narrested, tried by court-martial at Cincinnati, and sentenced to be\r\nplaced in confinement during the war.\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside, in command at Cincinnati, approved the sentence,\r\nand ordered that he be sent to Fort Warren, in Boston Harbor; but the\r\nPresident ordered that he be sent “beyond our lines into those of\r\nhis friends.” He was therefore escorted to the Confederate lines in\r\nTennessee, thence going to Richmond. He did not meet with a very cordial\r\nreception there, and finally sought refuge in Canada.\r\n\r\nVallandigham died in a most peculiar way some years after the close of\r\nthe War, and it was thought by many that his death was the result of\r\npremeditation upon his part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGO DOWN WITH COLORS FLYING.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1864, the President called for five hundred thousand\r\nmore men. The country was much depressed. The Confederates had, in\r\ncomparatively small force, only a short time before, been to the very\r\ngates of Washington, and returned almost unharmed.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential election was impending. Many thought another call for\r\nmen at such a time would insure, if not destroy, Mr. Lincoln’s chances\r\nfor re-election. A friend said as much to him one day, after the\r\nPresident had told him of his purpose to make such a call.\r\n\r\n“As to my re-election,” replied Mr. Lincoln, “it matters not. We must\r\nhave the men. If I go down, I intend to go, like the Cumberland, with my\r\ncolors flying!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALL WERE TRAGEDIES.\r\n\r\nThe cartoon reproduced below was published in “Harper’s Weekly” on\r\nJanuary 31st, 1863, the explanatory text, underneath, reading in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\nMANAGER LINCOLN: “Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to say that the tragedy\r\nentitled ‘The Army of the Potomac’ has been withdrawn on account of\r\nquarrels among the leading performers, and I have substituted three\r\nnew and striking farces, or burlesques, one, entitled ‘The Repulse of\r\nVicksburg,’ by the well-known favorite, E. M. Stanton, Esq., and\r\nthe others, ‘The Loss of the Harriet Lane,’ and ‘The Exploits of the\r\nAlabama’--a very sweet thing in farces, I assure you--by the veteran\r\ncomposer, Gideon Welles. (Unbounded applause by the Copperheads).”\r\n\r\nIn July, after this cartoon appeared, the Army of the Potomac defeated\r\nLee at Gettysburg, and sounded the death-knell of the Confederacy;\r\nGeneral Hooker, with his corps from this Army opened the Tennessee\r\nRiver, thus affording some relief to the Union troops in Chattanooga;\r\nHooker’s men also captured Lookout Mountain, and assisted in taking\r\nMissionary Ridge.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant converted the farce “The Repulse of Vicksburg” into a\r\ntragedy for the Copperheads, taking that stronghold on July 4th, and\r\nCaptain Winslow, with the Union man-of-war Kearsarge, meeting the\r\nConfederate privateer Alabama, off the coast of France, near Cherbourg,\r\nfought the famous ship to a finish and sunk her. Thus the tragedy of\r\n“The Army of the Potomac” was given after all, and Playwright Stanton\r\nand Composer Welles were vindicated, their compositions having been\r\nreceived by the public with great favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“HE’S THE BEST OF US.”\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Seward did not appreciate President Lincoln’s ability\r\nuntil he had been associated with him for quite a time, but he was\r\nawakened to a full realization of the greatness of the Chief Executive\r\n“all of a sudden.”\r\n\r\nHaving submitted “Some Thoughts for the President’s Consideration”--a\r\nlengthy paper intended as an outline of the policy, both domestic and\r\nforeign, the Administration should pursue--he was not more surprised\r\nat the magnanimity and kindness of President Lincoln’s reply than the\r\nthorough mastery of the subject displayed by the President.\r\n\r\nA few months later, when the Secretary had begun to understand Mr.\r\nLincoln, he was quick and generous to acknowledge his power.\r\n\r\n“Executive force and vigor are rare qualities,” he wrote to Mrs. Seward.\r\n“The President is the best of us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LINCOLN “COMPOSED.”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Chandler, of the Telegraph Office in the War Department,\r\nonce told how President Lincoln wrote telegrams. Said he:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln frequently wrote telegrams in my office. His method of\r\ncomposition was slow and laborious. It was evident that he thought out\r\nwhat he was going to say before he touched his pen to the paper. He\r\nwould sit looking out of the window, his left elbow on the table, his\r\nhand scratching his temple, his lips moving, and frequently he spoke the\r\nsentence aloud or in a half whisper.\r\n\r\n“After he was satisfied that he had the proper expression, he would\r\nwrite it out. If one examines the originals of Mr. Lincoln’s telegrams\r\nand letters, he will find very few erasures and very little interlining.\r\nThis was because he had them definitely in his mind before writing them.\r\n\r\n“In this he was the exact opposite of Mr. Stanton, who wrote with\r\nfeverish haste, often scratching out words, and interlining frequently.\r\nSometimes he would seize a sheet which he had filled, and impatiently\r\ntear it into pieces.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMLIN MIGHT DO IT.\r\n\r\nSeveral United States Senators urged President Lincoln to muster\r\nSouthern slaves into the Union Army. Lincoln replied:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I have put thousands of muskets into the hands of loyal\r\ncitizens of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Western North Carolina. They have\r\nsaid they could defend themselves, if they had guns. I have given them\r\nthe guns. Now, these men do not believe in mustering-in the negro. If I\r\ndo it, these thousands of muskets will be turned against us. We should\r\nlose more than we should gain.”\r\n\r\nBeing still further urged, President Lincoln gave them this answer:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “I can’t do it. I can’t see it as you do. You may\r\nbe right, and I may be wrong; but I’ll tell you what I can do; I can\r\nresign in favor of Mr. Hamlin. Perhaps Mr. Hamlin could do it.”\r\n\r\nThe matter ended there, for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUN SHOT BETTER.\r\n\r\nThe President took a lively interest in all new firearm improvements and\r\ninventions, and it sometimes happened that, when an inventor could get\r\nnobody else in the Government to listen to him, the President would\r\npersonally test his gun. A former clerk in the Navy Department tells an\r\nincident illustrative.\r\n\r\nHe had stayed late one night at his desk, when he heard some one\r\nstriding up and down the hall muttering: “I do wonder if they have gone\r\nalready and left the building all alone.” Looking out, the clerk was\r\nsurprised to see the President.\r\n\r\n“Good evening,” said Mr. Lincoln. “I was just looking for that man who\r\ngoes shooting with me sometimes.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk knew Mr. Lincoln referred to a certain messenger of the\r\nOrdnance Department who had been accustomed to going with him to test\r\nweapons, but as this man had gone home, the clerk offered his services.\r\nTogether they went to the lawn south of the White House, where Mr.\r\nLincoln fixed up a target cut from a sheet of white Congressional\r\nnotepaper.\r\n\r\n“Then pacing off a distance of about eighty or a hundred feet,” writes\r\nthe clerk, “he raised the rifle to a level, took a quick aim, and drove\r\nthe round of seven shots in quick succession, the bullets shooting all\r\naround the target like a Gatling gun and one striking near the center.\r\n\r\n“‘I believe I can make this gun shoot better,’ said Mr. Lincoln, after\r\nwe had looked at the result of the first fire. With this he took from\r\nhis vest pocket a small wooden sight which he had whittled from a pine\r\nstick, and adjusted it over the sight of the carbine. He then shot two\r\nrounds, and of the fourteen bullets nearly a dozen hit the paper!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLENIENT WITH McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan, aside from his lack of aggressiveness, fretted\r\nthe President greatly with his complaints about military matters, his\r\nobtrusive criticism regarding political matters, and especially at his\r\ninsulting declaration to the Secretary of War, dated June 28th, 1862,\r\njust after his retreat to the James River.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck was made Commander-in-Chief of the Union forces in July,\r\n1862, and September 1st McClellan was called to Washington. The day\r\nbefore he had written his wife that “as a matter of self-respect,\r\nI cannot go there.” President Lincoln and General Halleck called at\r\nMcClellan’s house, and the President said: “As a favor to me, I wish\r\nyou would take command of the fortifications of Washington and all the\r\ntroops for the defense of the capital.”\r\n\r\nLincoln thought highly of McClellan’s ability as an organizer and\r\nhis strength in defense, yet any other President would have had him\r\ncourt-martialed for using this language, which appeared in McClellan’s\r\nletter of June 28th:\r\n\r\n“If I save this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to\r\nyou or to any other person in Washington. You have done your best to\r\nsacrifice this army.”\r\n\r\nThis letter, although addressed to the Secretary of War, distinctly\r\nembraced the President in the grave charge of conspiracy to defeat\r\nMcClellan’s army and sacrifice thousands of the lives of his soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDN’T WANT A MILITARY REPUTATION.\r\n\r\nLincoln was averse to being put up as a military hero.\r\n\r\nWhen General Cass was a candidate for the Presidency his friends sought\r\nto endow him with a military reputation.\r\n\r\nLincoln, at that time a representative in Congress, delivered a speech\r\nbefore the House, which, in its allusion to Mr. Cass, was exquisitely\r\nsarcastic and irresistibly humorous:\r\n\r\n“By the way, Mr. Speaker,” said Lincoln, “do you know I am a military\r\nhero?\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, in the days of the Black Hawk War, I fought, bled, and came\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“Speaking of General Cass’s career reminds me of my own.\r\n\r\n“I was not at Stillman’s defeat, but I was about as near it as Cass to\r\nHull’s surrender; and like him I saw the place very soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n“It is quite certain I did not break my sword, for I had none to break,\r\nbut I bent my musket pretty badly on one occasion.\r\n\r\n“If General Cass went in advance of me picking whortleberries, I guess I\r\nsurpassed him in charging upon the wild onion.\r\n\r\n“If he saw any live, fighting Indians, it was more than I did, but I had\r\na good many bloody struggles with the mosquitoes, and although I never\r\nfainted from loss of blood, I can truly say that I was often very\r\nhungry.”\r\n\r\nLincoln concluded by saying that if he ever turned Democrat and should\r\nrun for the Presidency, he hoped they would not make fun of him by\r\nattempting to make him a military hero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SURRENDER NO SLAVE.”\r\n\r\nAbout March, 1862, General Benjamin F. Butler, in command at Fortress\r\nMonroe, advised President Lincoln that he had determined to regard all\r\nslaves coming into his camps as contraband of war, and to employ their\r\nlabor under fair compensation, and Secretary of War Stanton replied to\r\nhim, in behalf of the President, approving his course, and saying,\r\n“You are not to interfere between master and slave on the one hand, nor\r\nsurrender slaves who may come within your lines.”\r\n\r\nThis was a significant milestone of progress to the great end that was\r\nthereafter to be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSCRIPTING DEAD MEN.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln being found fault with for making another “call,” said that\r\nif the country required it, he would continue to do so until the matter\r\nstood as described by a Western provost marshal, who says:\r\n\r\n“I listened a short time since to a butternut-clad individual, who\r\nsucceeded in making good his escape, expatiate most eloquently on\r\nthe rigidness with which the conscription was enforced south of the\r\nTennessee River. His response to a question propounded by a citizen ran\r\nsomewhat in this wise:\r\n\r\n“‘Do they conscript close over the river?’\r\n\r\n“‘Stranger, I should think they did! They take every man who hasn’t been\r\ndead more than two days!’\r\n\r\n“If this is correct, the Confederacy has at least a ghost of a chance\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\nAnd of another, a Methodist minister in Kansas, living on a small\r\nsalary, who was greatly troubled to get his quarterly instalment. He at\r\nlast told the non-paying trustees that he must have his money, as he was\r\nsuffering for the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\n“Money!” replied the trustees; “you preach for money? We thought you\r\npreached for the good of souls!”\r\n\r\n“Souls!” responded the reverend; “I can’t eat souls; and if I could it\r\nwould take a thousand such as yours to make a meal!”\r\n\r\n“That soul is the point, sir,” said the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S REJECTED MANUSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nOn February 5th, 1865, President Lincoln formulated a message to\r\nCongress, proposing the payment of $400,000,000 to the South as\r\ncompensation for slaves lost by emancipation, and submitted it to his\r\nCabinet, only to be unanimously rejected.\r\n\r\nLincoln sadly accepted the decision, and filed away the manuscript\r\nmessage, together with this indorsement thereon, to which his signature\r\nwas added: “February 5, 1865. To-day these papers, which explain\r\nthemselves, were drawn up and submitted to the Cabinet unanimously\r\ndisapproved by them.”\r\n\r\nWhen the proposed message was disapproved, Lincoln soberly asked: “How\r\nlong will the war last?”\r\n\r\nTo this none could make answer, and he added: “We are spending now, in\r\ncarrying on the war, $3,000,000 a day, which will amount to all this\r\nmoney, besides all the lives.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AS A STORY WRITER.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, Mr. Lincoln once got an idea for a thrilling, romantic\r\nstory. One day, in Springfield, he was sitting with his feet on the\r\nwindow sill, chatting with an acquaintance, when he suddenly changed the\r\ndrift of the conversation by saying: “Did you ever write out a story in\r\nyour mind? I did when I was a little codger. One day a wagon with a lady\r\nand two girls and a man broke down near us, and while they were fixing\r\nup, they cooked in our kitchen. The woman had books and read us stories,\r\nand they were the first I had ever heard. I took a great fancy to one\r\nof the girls; and when they were gone I thought of her a great deal,\r\nand one day when I was sitting out in the sun by the house I wrote out\r\na story in my mind. I thought I took my father’s horse and followed\r\nthe wagon, and finally I found it, and they were surprised to see me. I\r\ntalked with the girl, and persuaded her to elope with me; and that night\r\nI put her on my horse, and we started off across the prairie. After\r\nseveral hours we came to a camp; and when we rode up we found it was the\r\none we had left a few hours before, and went in. The next night we tried\r\nagain, and the same thing happened--the horse came back to the same\r\nplace; and then we concluded that we ought not to elope. I stayed until\r\nI had persuaded her father to give her to me. I always meant to write\r\nthat story out and publish it, and I began once; but I concluded that it\r\nwas not much of a story. But I think that was the beginning of love with\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S IDEAS ON CROSSING A RIVER WHEN HE GOT TO IT.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s reply to a Springfield (Illinois) clergyman, who asked him\r\nwhat was to be his policy on the slavery question was most apt:\r\n\r\n“Well, your question is rather a cool one, but I will answer it by\r\ntelling you a story:\r\n\r\n“You know Father B., the old Methodist preacher? and you know Fox River\r\nand its freshets?\r\n\r\n“Well, once in the presence of Father B., a young Methodist was worrying\r\nabout Fox River, and expressing fears that he should be prevented from\r\nfulfilling some of his appointments by a freshet in the river.\r\n\r\n“Father B. checked him in his gravest manner. Said he:\r\n\r\n“‘Young man, I have always made it a rule in my life not to cross Fox\r\nRiver till I get to it.’\r\n\r\n“And,” said the President, “I am not going to worry myself over the\r\nslavery question till I get to it.”\r\n\r\nA few days afterward a Methodist minister called on the President, and\r\non being presented to him, said, simply:\r\n\r\n“Mr. President, I have come to tell you that I think we have got to Fox\r\nRiver!”\r\n\r\nLincoln thanked the clergyman, and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT NOMINATED FIRST.\r\n\r\nThe day of Lincoln’s second nomination for the Presidency he forgot\r\nall about the Republican National Convention, sitting at Baltimore,\r\nand wandered over to the War Department. While there, a telegram came\r\nannouncing the nomination of Johnson as Vice-President.\r\n\r\n“What,” said Lincoln to the operator, “do they nominate a Vice-President\r\nbefore they do a President?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied the astonished official, “have you not heard of your own\r\nnomination? It was sent to the White House two hours ago.”\r\n\r\n“It is all right,” replied the President; “I shall probably find it on\r\nmy return.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THEM GILLITEENS.”\r\n\r\nThe illustrated newspapers of the United States and England had a good\r\ndeal of fun, not only with President Lincoln, but the latter’s Cabinet\r\nofficers and military commanders as well. It was said by these\r\nfunny publications that the President had set up a guillotine in his\r\n“back-yard,” where all those who offended were beheaded with both\r\nneatness, and despatch. “Harper’s Weekly” of January 3rd, 1863,\r\ncontained a cartoon labeled “Those Guillotines; a Little Incident at the\r\nWhite House,” the personages figuring in the “incident” being Secretary\r\nof War Stanton and a Union general who had been unfortunate enough to\r\nlose a battle to the Confederates. Beneath the cartoon was the following\r\ndialogue:\r\n\r\nSERVANT: “If ye plase, sir, them Gilliteens has arrove.” MR. LINCOLN:\r\n“All right, Michael. Now, gentlemen, will you be kind enough to step out\r\nin the back-yard?”\r\n\r\nThe hair and whiskers of Secretary of War Stanton are ruffled and awry,\r\nand his features are not calm and undisturbed, indicating that he has\r\nan idea of what’s the matter in that back-yard; the countenance of the\r\nofficer in the rear of the Secretary of War wears rather an anxious, or\r\nworried, look, and his hair isn’t combed smoothly, either.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln’s frequent changes among army commanders--before\r\nhe found Grant, Sherman and Sheridan--afforded an opportunity the\r\ncaricaturists did not neglect, and some very clever cartoons were the\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“CONSIDER THE SYMPATHY OF LINCOLN.”\r\n\r\nConsider the sympathy of Abraham Lincoln. Do you know the story of\r\nWilliam Scott, private? He was a boy from a Vermont farm.\r\n\r\nThere had been a long march, and the night succeeding it he had stood on\r\npicket. The next day there had been another long march, and that night\r\nWilliam Scott had volunteered to stand guard in the place of a sick\r\ncomrade who had been drawn for the duty.\r\n\r\nIt was too much for William Scott. He was too tired. He had been found\r\nsleeping on his beat.\r\n\r\nThe army was at Chain Bridge. It was in a dangerous neighborhood.\r\nDiscipline must be kept.\r\n\r\nWilliam Scott was apprehended, tried by court-martial, sentenced to\r\nbe shot. News of the case was carried to Lincoln. William Scott was a\r\nprisoner in his tent, expecting to be shot next day.\r\n\r\nBut the flaps of his tent were parted, and Lincoln stood before him.\r\nScott said:\r\n\r\n“The President was the kindest man I had ever seen; I knew him at once\r\nby a Lincoln medal I had long worn.\r\n\r\n“I was scared at first, for I had never before talked with a great man;\r\nbut Mr. Lincoln was so easy with me, so gentle, that I soon forgot my\r\nfright.\r\n\r\n“He asked me all about the people at home, the neighbors, the farm, and\r\nwhere I went to school, and who my schoolmates were. Then he asked\r\nme about mother and how she looked; and I was glad I could take her\r\nphotograph from my bosom and show it to him.\r\n\r\n“He said how thankful I ought to be that my mother still lived, and how,\r\nif he were in my place, he would try to make her a proud mother, and\r\nnever cause her a sorrow or a tear.\r\n\r\n“I cannot remember it all, but every word was so kind.\r\n\r\n“He had said nothing yet about that dreadful next morning; I thought it\r\nmust be that he was so kind-hearted that he didn’t like to speak of it.\r\n\r\n“But why did he say so much about my mother, and my not causing her a\r\nsorrow or a tear, when I knew that I must die the next morning?\r\n\r\n“But I supposed that was something that would have to go unexplained;\r\nand so I determined to brace up and tell him that I did not feel a bit\r\nguilty, and ask him wouldn’t he fix it so that the firing party would\r\nnot be from our regiment.\r\n\r\n“That was going to be the hardest of all--to die by the hands of my\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\n“Just as I was going to ask him this favor, he stood up, and he says to\r\nme:\r\n\r\n“‘My boy, stand up here and look me in the face.’\r\n\r\n“I did as he bade me.\r\n\r\n“‘My boy,’ he said, ‘you are not going to be shot to-morrow. I believe\r\nyou when you tell me that you could not keep awake.\r\n\r\n“‘I am going to trust you, and send you back to your regiment.\r\n\r\n“‘But I have been put to a good deal of trouble on your account.\r\n\r\n“‘I have had to come up here from Washington when I have got a great\r\ndeal to do; and what I want to know is, how are you going to pay my\r\nbill?’\r\n\r\n“There was a big lump in my throat; I could scarcely speak. I had\r\nexpected to die, you see, and had kind of got used to thinking that way.\r\n\r\n“To have it all changed in a minute! But I got it crowded down, and\r\nmanaged to say:\r\n\r\n“‘I am grateful, Mr. Lincoln! I hope I am as grateful as ever a man can\r\nbe to you for saving my life.\r\n\r\n“‘But it comes upon me sudden and unexpected like. I didn’t lay out for\r\nit at all; but there is some way to pay you, and I will find it after a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n“‘There is the bounty in the savings bank; I guess we could borrow some\r\nmoney on the mortgage of the farm.’\r\n\r\n“‘There was my pay was something, and if he would wait until pay-day\r\nI was sure the boys would help; so I thought we could make it up if it\r\nwasn’t more than five or six hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n“‘But it is a great deal more than that,’ he said.\r\n\r\n“Then I said I didn’t just see how, but I was sure I would find some\r\nway--if I lived.\r\n\r\n“Then Mr. Lincoln put his hands on my shoulders, and looked into my face\r\nas if he was sorry, and said; “‘My boy, my bill is a very large one.\r\nYour friends cannot pay it, nor your bounty, nor the farm, nor all your\r\ncomrades!\r\n\r\n“‘There is only one man in all the world who can pay it, and his name is\r\nWilliam Scott!\r\n\r\n“‘If from this day William Scott does his duty, so that, if I was there\r\nwhen he comes to die, he can look me in the face as he does now, and\r\nsay, I have kept my promise, and I have done my duty as a soldier, then\r\nmy debt will be paid.\r\n\r\n“‘Will you make that promise and try to keep it?”\r\n\r\nThe promise was given. Thenceforward there never was such a soldier as\r\nWilliam Scott.\r\n\r\nThis is the record of the end. It was after one of the awful battles of\r\nthe Peninsula. He was shot all to pieces. He said:\r\n\r\n“Boys, I shall never see another battle. I supposed this would be my\r\nlast. I haven’t much to say.\r\n\r\n“You all know what you can tell them at home about me.\r\n\r\n“I have tried to do the right thing! If any of you ever have the chance\r\nI wish you would tell President Lincoln that I have never forgotten the\r\nkind words he said to me at the Chain Bridge; that I have tried to be a\r\ngood soldier and true to the flag; that I should have paid my whole\r\ndebt to him if I had lived; and that now, when I know that I am dying,\r\nI think of his kind face, and thank him again, because he gave me the\r\nchance to fall like a soldier in battle, and not like a coward, by the\r\nhands of my comrades.”\r\n\r\nWhat wonder that Secretary Stanton said, as he gazed upon the tall form\r\nand kindly face as he lay there, smitten down by the assassin’s bullet,\r\n“There lies the most perfect ruler of men who ever lived.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVED A LIFE.\r\n\r\nOne day during the Black Hawk War a poor old Indian came into the camp\r\nwith a paper of safe conduct from General Lewis Cass in his possession.\r\nThe members of Lincoln’s company were greatly exasperated by late Indian\r\nbarbarities, among them the horrible murder of a number of women and\r\nchildren, and were about to kill him; they said the safe-conduct paper\r\nwas a forgery, and approached the old savage with muskets cocked to\r\nshoot him.\r\n\r\nLincoln rushed forward, struck up the weapons with his hands, and\r\nstanding in front of the victim, declared to the Indian that he should\r\nnot be killed. It was with great difficulty that the men could be kept\r\nfrom their purpose, but the courage and firmness of Lincoln thwarted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLincoln was physically one of the bravest of men, as his company\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN PLAYED BALL.\r\n\r\nFrank P. Blair, of Chicago, tells an incident, showing Mr. Lincoln’s\r\nlove for children and how thoroughly he entered into all of their\r\nsports:\r\n\r\n“During the war my grandfather, Francis P. Blair, Sr., lived at Silver\r\nSprings, north of Washington, seven miles from the White House. It was a\r\nmagnificent place of four or five hundred acres, with an extensive lawn\r\nin the rear of the house. The grandchildren gathered there frequently.\r\n\r\n“There were eight or ten of us, our ages ranging from eight to twelve\r\nyears. Although I was but seven or eight years of age, Mr. Lincoln’s\r\nvisits were of such importance to us boys as to leave a clear impression\r\non my memory. He drove out to the place quite frequently. We boys, for\r\nhours at a time played ‘town ball’ on the vast lawn, and Mr. Lincoln\r\nwould join ardently in the sport. I remember vividly how he ran with the\r\nchildren; how long were his strides, and how far his coat-tails stuck\r\nout behind, and how we tried to hit him with the ball, as he ran the\r\nbases. He entered into the spirit of the play as completely as any of\r\nus, and we invariably hailed his coming with delight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS PASSES TO RICHMOND NOT HONORED.\r\n\r\nA man called upon the President and solicited a pass for Richmond.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the President, “I would be very happy to oblige, if my\r\npasses were respected; but the fact is, sir, I have, within the past\r\ntwo years, given passes to two hundred and fifty thousand men to go to\r\nRichmond, and not one has got there yet.”\r\n\r\nThe applicant quietly and respectfully withdrew on his tiptoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“PUBLIC HANGMAN” FOR THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA certain United States Senator, who believed that every man who\r\nbelieved in secession should be hanged, asked the President what he\r\nintended to do when the War was over.\r\n\r\n“Reconstruct the machinery of this Government,” quickly replied Lincoln.\r\n\r\n“You are certainly crazy,” was the Senator’s heated response. “You\r\ntalk as if treason was not henceforth to be made odious, but that\r\nthe traitors, cutthroats and authors of this War should not only go\r\nunpunished, but receive encouragement to repeat their treason with\r\nimpunity! They should be hanged higher than Haman, sir! Yes, higher than\r\nany malefactor the world has ever known!”\r\n\r\nThe President was entirely unmoved, but, after a moment’s pause, put a\r\nquestion which all but drove his visitor insane.\r\n\r\n“Now, Senator, suppose that when this hanging arrangement has been\r\nagreed upon, you accept the post of Chief Executioner. If you will take\r\nthe office, I will make you a brigadier general and Public Hangman for\r\nthe United States. That would just about suit you, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I am a gentleman, sir,” returned the Senator, “and I certainly thought\r\nyou knew me better than to believe me capable of doing such dirty work.\r\nYou are jesting, Mr. President.”\r\n\r\nThe President was extremely patient, exhibiting no signs of ire, and to\r\nthis bit of temper on the part of the Senator responded:\r\n\r\n“You speak of being a gentleman; yet you forget that in this free\r\ncountry all men are equal, the vagrant and the gentleman standing on the\r\nsame ground when it comes to rights and duties, particularly in time\r\nof war. Therefore, being a gentleman, as you claim, and a law-abiding\r\ncitizen, I trust, you are not exempt from doing even the dirty work at\r\nwhich your high spirit revolts.”\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the Senator, who quitted the room abruptly, and\r\nnever again showed his face in the White House while Lincoln occupied\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“He won’t bother me again,” was the President’s remark as he departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW, BUT BOISTEROUS.\r\n\r\nLincoln was a very quiet man, and went about his business in a quiet\r\nway, making the least noise possible. He heartily disliked those\r\nboisterous people who were constantly deluging him with advice, and\r\nshouting at the tops of their voices whenever they appeared at the White\r\nHouse. “These noisy people create a great clamor,” said he one day, in\r\nconversation with some personal friends, “and remind me, by the way, of\r\na good story I heard out in Illinois while I was practicing, or trying\r\nto practice, some law there. I will say, though, that I practiced more\r\nlaw than I ever got paid for.\r\n\r\n“A fellow who lived just out of town, on the bank of a large marsh,\r\nconceived a big idea in the money-making line. He took it to a prominent\r\nmerchant, and began to develop his plans and specifications. ‘There are\r\nat least ten million frogs in that marsh near me, an’ I’ll just arrest a\r\ncouple of carloads of them and hand them over to you. You can send them\r\nto the big cities and make lots of money for both of us. Frogs’ legs are\r\ngreat delicacies in the big towns, an’ not very plentiful. It won’t\r\ntake me more’n two or three days to pick ‘em. They make so much noise\r\nmy family can’t sleep, and by this deal I’ll get rid of a nuisance and\r\ngather in some cash.’\r\n\r\n“The merchant agreed to the proposition, promised the fellow he would\r\npay him well for the two carloads. Two days passed, then three, and\r\nfinally two weeks were gone before the fellow showed up again, carrying\r\na small basket. He looked weary and ‘done up,’ and he wasn’t talkative\r\na bit. He threw the basket on the counter with the remark, ‘There’s your\r\nfrogs.’\r\n\r\n“‘You haven’t two carloads in that basket, have you?’ inquired the\r\nmerchant.\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ was the reply, ‘and there ain’t no two carloads in all this\r\nblasted world.’\r\n\r\n“‘I thought you said there were at least ten millions of ‘em in\r\nthat marsh near you, according to the noise they made,’ observed the\r\nmerchant. ‘Your people couldn’t sleep because of ‘em.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said the fellow, ‘accordin’ to the noise they made, there was,\r\nI thought, a hundred million of ‘em, but when I had waded and swum that\r\nthere marsh day and night fer two blessed weeks, I couldn’t harvest\r\nbut six. There’s two or three left yet, an’ the marsh is as noisy as it\r\nuster be. We haven’t catched up on any of our lost sleep yet. Now, you\r\ncan have these here six, an’ I won’t charge you a cent fer ‘em.’\r\n\r\n“You can see by this little yarn,” remarked the President, “that these\r\nboisterous people make too much noise in proportion to their numbers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP PEGGING AWAY.\r\n\r\nBeing asked one time by an “anxious” visitor as to what he would do\r\nin certain contingencies--provided the rebellion was not subdued after\r\nthree or four years of effort on the part of the Government?\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied the President, “there is no alternative but to keep\r\n‘pegging’ away!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEWARE OF THE TAIL.\r\n\r\nAfter the issue of the Emancipation Proclamation, Governor Morgan, of\r\nNew York, was at the White House one day, when the President said:\r\n\r\n“I do not agree with those who say that slavery is dead. We are like\r\nwhalers who have been long on a chase--we have at last got the harpoon\r\ninto the monster, but we must now look how we steer, or, with one ‘flop’\r\nof his tail, he will yet send us all into eternity!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“LINCOLN’S DREAM.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was depicted as a headsman in a cartoon printed in\r\n“Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper,” on February 14, 1863, the title\r\nof the picture being “Lincoln’s Dreams; or, There’s a Good Time Coming.”\r\n\r\nThe cartoon, reproduced here, represents, on the right, the Union\r\nGenerals who had been defeated by the Confederates in battle, and had\r\nsuffered decapitation in consequence--McDowell, who lost at Bull Run;\r\nMcClellan, who failed to take Richmond, when within twelve miles of that\r\ncity and no opposition, comparatively; and Burnside, who was so badly\r\nwhipped at Fredericksburg. To the left of the block, where the President\r\nis standing with the bloody axe in his hand, are shown the members\r\nof the Cabinet--Secretary of State Seward, Secretary of War Stanton,\r\nSecretary of the Navy Welles, and others--each awaiting his turn. This\r\npart of the “Dream” was never realized, however, as the President did\r\nnot decapitate any of his Cabinet officers.\r\n\r\nIt was the idea of the cartoonist to hold Lincoln up as a man who would\r\nnot countenance failure upon the part of subordinates, but visit the\r\nseverest punishment upon those commanders who did not win victories.\r\nAfter Burnside’s defeat at Fredericksburg, he was relieved by Hooker,\r\nwho suffered disaster at Chancellorsville; Hooker was relieved by Meade,\r\nwho won at Gettysburg, but was refused promotion because he did not\r\nfollow up and crush Lee; Rosecrans was all but defeated at Chickamauga,\r\nand gave way to Grant, who, of all the Union commanders, had never\r\nsuffered defeat. Grant was Lincoln’s ideal fighting man, and the “Old\r\nCommander” was never superseded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE WAS NO NEED OF A STORY.\r\n\r\nDr. Hovey, of Dansville, New York, thought he would call and see the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the White House he found the President on horseback,\r\nready for a start.\r\n\r\nApproaching him, he said:\r\n\r\n“President Lincoln, I thought I would call and see you before leaving\r\nthe city, and hear you tell a story.”\r\n\r\nThe President greeted him pleasantly, and asked where he was from.\r\n\r\n“From Western New York.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s a good enough country without stories,” replied the\r\nPresident, and off he rode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN A MAN OF SIMPLE HABITS.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s habits at the White House were as simple as they were at his\r\nold home in Illinois.\r\n\r\nHe never alluded to himself as “President,” or as occupying “the\r\nPresidency.”\r\n\r\nHis office he always designated as “the place.”\r\n\r\n“Call me Lincoln,” said he to a friend; “Mr. President” had become so\r\nvery tiresome to him.\r\n\r\n“If you see a newsboy down the street, send him up this way,” said he to\r\na passenger, as he stood waiting for the morning news at his gate.\r\n\r\nFriends cautioned him about exposing himself so openly in the midst of\r\nenemies; but he never heeded them.\r\n\r\nHe frequently walked the streets at night, entirely unprotected; and\r\nfelt any check upon his movements a great annoyance.\r\n\r\nHe delighted to see his familiar Western friends; and he gave them\r\nalways a cordial welcome.\r\n\r\nHe met them on the old footing, and fell at once into the accustomed\r\nhabits of talk and story-telling.\r\n\r\nAn old acquaintance, with his wife, visited Washington. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLincoln proposed to these friends a ride in the Presidential carriage.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated in advance that the two men had probably never seen\r\neach other with gloves on in their lives, unless when they were used as\r\nprotection from the cold.\r\n\r\nThe question of each--Lincoln at the White House, and his friend at the\r\nhotel--was, whether he should wear gloves.\r\n\r\nOf course the ladies urged gloves; but Lincoln only put his in his\r\npocket, to be used or not, according to the circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the Presidential party arrived at the hotel, to take in their\r\nfriends, they found the gentleman, overcome by his wife’s persuasions,\r\nvery handsomely gloved.\r\n\r\nThe moment he took his seat he began to draw off the clinging kids,\r\nwhile Lincoln began to draw his on!\r\n\r\n“No! no! no!” protested his friend, tugging at his gloves. “It is none\r\nof my doings; put up your gloves, Mr. Lincoln.”\r\n\r\nSo the two old friends were on even and easy terms, and had their ride\r\nafter their old fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS LAST SPEECH.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was reading the draft of a speech. Edward, the\r\nconservative but dignified butler of the White House, was seen\r\nstruggling with Tad and trying to drag him back from the window from\r\nwhich was waving a Confederate flag, captured in some fight and given to\r\nthe boy. Edward conquered and Tad, rushing to find his father, met him\r\ncoming forward to make, as it proved, his last speech.\r\n\r\nThe speech began with these words, “We meet this evening, not in sorrow,\r\nbut in gladness of heart.” Having his speech written in loose leaves,\r\nand being compelled to hold a candle in the other hand, he would let the\r\nloose leaves drop to the floor one by one. “Tad” picked them up as they\r\nfell, and impatiently called for more as they fell from his father’s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGOT EVERYTHING HE KNEW BEFORE.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, while entertaining a few select friends, is said to\r\nhave related the following anecdote of a man who knew too much:\r\n\r\nHe was a careful, painstaking fellow, who always wanted to be absolutely\r\nexact, and as a result he frequently got the ill-will of his less\r\ncareful superiors.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of President Jackson there was a singular\r\nyoung gentleman employed in the Public Postoffice in Washington.\r\n\r\nHis name was G.; he was from Tennessee, the son of a widow, a neighbor\r\nof the President, on which account the old hero had a kind feeling for\r\nhim, and always got him out of difficulties with some of the higher\r\nofficials, to whom his singular interference was distasteful.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, it is said of him that while employed in the General\r\nPostoffice, on one occasion he had to copy a letter to Major H., a\r\nhigh official, in answer to an application made by an old gentleman in\r\nVirginia or Pennsylvania, for the establishment of a new postoffice.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the letter said the application could not be granted, in\r\nconsequence of the applicant’s “proximity” to another office.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter came into G.’s hand to copy, being a great stickler for\r\nplainness, he altered “proximity” to “nearness to.”\r\n\r\nMajor H. observed it, and asked G. why he altered his letter.\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied G., “because I don’t think the man would understand what\r\nyou mean by proximity.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Major H., “try him; put in the ‘proximity’ again.”\r\n\r\nIn a few days a letter was received from the applicant, in which he very\r\nindignantly said that his father had fought for liberty in the second\r\nwar for independence, and he should like to have the name of the\r\nscoundrel who brought the charge of proximity or anything else wrong\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n“There,” said G., “did I not say so?”\r\n\r\nG. carried his improvements so far that Mr. Berry, the\r\nPostmaster-General, said to him: “I don’t want you any longer; you know\r\ntoo much.”\r\n\r\nPoor G. went out, but his old friend got him another place.\r\n\r\nThis time G.’s ideas underwent a change. He was one day very busy\r\nwriting, when a stranger called in and asked him where the Patent Office\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said G.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me where the Treasury Department is?” said the stranger.\r\n\r\n“No,” said G.\r\n\r\n“Nor the President’s house?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger finally asked him if he knew where the Capitol was.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied G.\r\n\r\n“Do you live in Washington, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said G.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! and don’t you know where the Patent Office, Treasury,\r\nPresident’s house and Capitol are?”\r\n\r\n“Stranger,” said G., “I was turned out of the postoffice for knowing too\r\nmuch. I don’t mean to offend in that way again.\r\n\r\n“I am paid for keeping this book.\r\n\r\n“I believe I know that much; but if you find me knowing anything more\r\nyou may take my head.”\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN BELIEVED IN EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n“That every man may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby\r\nbe enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries, by\r\nwhich he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions, appears\r\nto be an object of vital importance; even on this account alone, to say\r\nnothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being\r\nable to read the Scriptures and other works, both of a religious and\r\nmoral nature, for themselves.\r\n\r\n“For my part, I desire to see the time when education, by its means,\r\nmorality, sobriety, enterprise and integrity, shall become much more\r\ngeneral than at present, and should be gratified to have it in my power\r\nto contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might\r\nhave a tendency to accelerate the happy period.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN ON THE DRED SCOTT DECISION.\r\n\r\nIn a speech at Springfield, Illinois, June 26th, 1857, Lincoln referred\r\nto the decision of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, of the United States\r\nSupreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, in this manner:\r\n\r\n“The Chief justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes as a\r\nfact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable now\r\nthan it was in the days of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n“In those days, by common consent, the spread of the black man’s bondage\r\nin the new countries was prohibited; but now Congress decides that it\r\nwill not continue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it\r\ncould not if it would.\r\n\r\n“In those days, our Declaration of Independence was held sacred by all,\r\nand thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the bondage of\r\nthe negro universal and eternal, it is assailed and sneered at, and\r\nconstructed and hawked at, and torn, till, if its framers could rise\r\nfrom their graves, they could not at all recognize it.\r\n\r\n“All the powers of earth seem combining against the slave; Mammon is\r\nafter him, ambition follows, philosophy follows, and the theology of the\r\nday is fast joining the cry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN MADE MANY NOTABLE SPEECHES.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln made many notable addresses and speeches during his\r\ncareer previous to the time of his election to the Presidency.\r\n\r\nHowever, beautiful in thought and expression as they were, they were not\r\nappreciated by those who heard and read them until after the people\r\nof the United States and the world had come to understand the man who\r\ndelivered them.\r\n\r\nLincoln had the rare and valuable faculty of putting the most sublime\r\nfeeling into his speeches; and he never found it necessary to incumber\r\nhis wisest, wittiest and most famous sayings with a weakening mass of\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nHe put his thoughts into the simplest language, so that all might\r\ncomprehend, and he never said anything which was not full of the deepest\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT AILED THE BOYS.\r\n\r\nMr. Roland Diller, who was one of Mr. Lincoln’s neighbors in\r\nSpringfield, tells the following:\r\n\r\n“I was called to the door one day by the cries of children in the\r\nstreet, and there was Mr. Lincoln, striding by with two of his boys,\r\nboth of whom were wailing aloud. ‘Why, Mr. Lincoln, what’s the matter\r\nwith the boys?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n“‘Just what’s the matter with the whole world,’ Lincoln replied. ‘I’ve\r\ngot three walnuts, and each wants two.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAD’S CONFEDERATE FLAG.\r\n\r\nOne of the prettiest incidents in the closing days of the Civil War\r\noccurred when the troops, ‘marching home again,’ passed in grand form,\r\nif with well-worn uniforms and tattered bunting, before the White House.\r\n\r\nNaturally, an immense crowd had assembled on the streets, the lawns,\r\nporches, balconies, and windows, even those of the executive mansion\r\nitself being crowded to excess. A central figure was that of the\r\nPresident, Abraham Lincoln, who, with bared head, unfurled and waved our\r\nNation’s flag in the midst of lusty cheers.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there was an unexpected sight.\r\n\r\nA small boy leaned forward and sent streaming to the air the banner of\r\nthe boys in gray. It was an old flag which had been captured from the\r\nConfederates, and which the urchin, the President’s second son, Tad, had\r\nobtained possession of and considered an additional triumph to unfurl on\r\nthis all-important day.\r\n\r\nVainly did the servant who had followed him to the window plead with\r\nhim to desist. No, Master Tad, Pet of the White House, was not to be\r\nprevented from adding to the loyal demonstration of the hour.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, however, the crowd viewed it differently. Had it\r\nfloated from any other window in the capital that day, no doubt it would\r\nhave been the target of contempt and abuse; but when the President,\r\nunderstanding what had happened, turned, with a smile on his grand,\r\nplain face, and showed his approval by a gesture and expression, cheer\r\nafter cheer rent the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLED BLESSINGS ON THE AMERICAN WOMEN.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln attended a Ladies’ Fair for the benefit of the Union\r\nsoldiers, at Washington, March 16th, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn his remarks he said:\r\n\r\n“I appear to say but a word.\r\n\r\n“This extraordinary war in which we are engaged falls heavily upon all\r\nclasses of people, but the most heavily upon the soldiers. For it has\r\nbeen said, ‘All that a man hath will he give for his life,’ and, while\r\nall contribute of their substance, the soldier puts his life at stake,\r\nand often yields it up in his country’s cause.\r\n\r\n“The highest merit, then, is due the soldiers.\r\n\r\n“In this extraordinary war extraordinary developments have manifested\r\nthemselves such as have not been seen in former wars; and among these\r\nmanifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the\r\nrelief of suffering soldiers and their families, and the chief agents in\r\nthese fairs are the women of America!\r\n\r\n“I am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy; I have never\r\nstudied the art of paying compliments to women; but I must say that if\r\nall that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the\r\nworld in praise of women were applied to the women of America, it would\r\nnot do them justice for their conduct during the war.\r\n\r\n“I will close by saying, God bless the women of America!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S “ORDER NO. 252.”\r\n\r\nAfter the United States had enlisted former negro slaves as soldiers to\r\nfight alongside the Northern troops for the maintenance of the integrity\r\nof the Union, so great was the indignation of the Confederate Government\r\nthat President Davis declared he would not recognize blacks captured in\r\nbattle and in uniform as prisoners of war. This meant that he would have\r\nthem returned to their previous owners, have them flogged and fined for\r\nrunning away from their masters, or even shot if he felt like it. This\r\nattitude of the President of the Confederate States of America led to\r\nthe promulgation of President Lincoln’s famous “Order No. 252,” which,\r\nin effect, was a notification to the commanding officers of the Southern\r\nforces that if negro prisoners of war were not treated as such, the\r\nUnion commanders would retaliate. “Harper’s Weekly” of August 15th,\r\n1863, contained a clever cartoon, which we reproduce, representing\r\nPresident Lincoln holding the South by the collar, while “Old\r\nAbe” shouts the following words of warning to Jeff Davis, who,\r\ncat-o’-nine-tails in hand, is in pursuit of a terrified little negro\r\nboy:\r\n\r\nMR. LINCOLN: “Look here, Jeff Davis! If you lay a finger on that boy, to\r\nhurt him, I’ll lick this ugly cub of yours within an inch of his life!”\r\n\r\nMuch to the surprise of the Confederates, the negro soldiers fought\r\nvaliantly; they were fearless when well led, obeyed orders without\r\nhesitation, were amenable to discipline, and were eager and anxious, at\r\nall times, to do their duty. In battle they were formidable opponents,\r\nand in using the bayonet were the equal of the best trained troops. The\r\nSoutherners hated them beyond power of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALKED TO THE NEGROES OF RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nThe President walked through the streets of Richmond--without a guard\r\nexcept a few seamen--in company with his son “Tad,” and Admiral Porter,\r\non April 4th, 1865, the day following the evacuation of the city.\r\n\r\nColored people gathered about him on every side, eager to see and thank\r\ntheir liberator. Mr. Lincoln addressed the following remarks to one of\r\nthese gatherings:\r\n\r\n“My poor friends, you are free--free as air. You can cast off the name\r\nof slave and trample upon it; it will come to you no more.\r\n\r\n“Liberty is your birthright. God gave it to you as He gave it to others,\r\nand it is a sin that you have been deprived of it for so many years.\r\n\r\n“But you must try to deserve this priceless boon. Let the world see that\r\nyou merit it, and are able to maintain it by your good work.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let your joy carry you into excesses; learn the laws, and obey\r\nthem. Obey God’s commandments, and thank Him for giving you liberty, for\r\nto Him you owe all things.\r\n\r\n“There, now, let me pass on; I have but little time to spare.\r\n\r\n“I want to see the Capitol, and must return at once to Washington to\r\nsecure to you that liberty which you seem to prize so highly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” ADDED A SAVING CLAUSE.\r\n\r\nLincoln fell in love with Miss Mary S. Owens about 1833 or so, and,\r\nwhile she was attracted toward him she was not passionately fond of him.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s letter of proposal of marriage, sent by him to Miss Owens,\r\nwhile singular, unique, and decidedly unconventional, was certainly not\r\nvery ardent. He, after the fashion of the lawyer, presented the matter\r\nvery cautiously, and pleaded his own cause; then presented her side\r\nof the case, advised her not “to do it,” and agreed to abide by her\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nMiss Owens respected Lincoln, but promptly rejected him--really very\r\nmuch to “Abe’s” relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW “JACK” WAS “DONE UP.”\r\n\r\nNot far from New Salem, Illinois, at a place called Clary’s Grove, a\r\ngang of frontier ruffians had established headquarters, and the champion\r\nwrestler of “The Grove” was “Jack” Armstrong, a bully of the worst type.\r\n\r\nLearning that Abraham was something of a wrestler himself, “Jack” sent\r\nhim a challenge. At that time and in that community a refusal would have\r\nresulted in social and business ostracism, not to mention the stigma of\r\ncowardice which would attach.\r\n\r\nIt was a great day for New Salem and “The Grove” when Lincoln and\r\nArmstrong met. Settlers within a radius of fifty miles flocked to the\r\nscene, and the wagers laid were heavy and many. Armstrong proved a\r\nweakling in the hands of the powerful Kentuckian, and “Jack’s” adherents\r\nwere about to mob Lincoln when the latter’s friends saved him from\r\nprobable death by rushing to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGELS COULDN’T SWEAR IT RIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe President was once speaking about an attack made on him by the\r\nCongressional Committee on the Conduct of the War for a certain alleged\r\nblunder in the Southwest--the matter involved being one which had\r\nfallen directly under the observation of the army officer to whom he was\r\ntalking, who possessed official evidence completely upsetting all the\r\nconclusions of the Committee.\r\n\r\n“Might it not be well for me,” queried the officer, “to set this matter\r\nright in a letter to some paper, stating the facts as they actually\r\ntranspired?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” replied the President, “at least, not now. If I were to try to\r\nread, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as\r\nwell be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how the\r\nvery best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the\r\nend brings me out all right, what is said against me won’t amount to\r\nanything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten thousand angels swearing I\r\nwas right would make no difference.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MUST GO, AND GO TO STAY.”\r\n\r\nWard Hill Lamon was President Lincoln’s Cerberus, his watch dog,\r\nguardian, friend, companion and confidant. Some days before Lincoln’s\r\ndeparture for Washington to be inaugurated, he wrote to Lamon at\r\nBloomington, that he desired to see him at once. He went to Springfield,\r\nand Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n“Hill, on the 11th I go to Washington, and I want you to go along with\r\nme. Our friends have already asked me to send you as Consul to Paris.\r\nYou know I would cheerfully give you anything for which our friends may\r\nask or which you may desire, but it looks as if we might have war.\r\n\r\n“In that case I want you with me. In fact, I must have you. So get\r\nyourself ready and come along. It will be handy to have you around. If\r\nthere is to be a fight, I want you to help me to do my share of it, as\r\nyou have done in times past. You must go, and go to stay.”\r\n\r\nThis is Lamon’s version of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN WASN’T BUYING NOMINATIONS.\r\n\r\nTo a party who wished to be empowered to negotiate reward for promises\r\nof influence in the Chicago Convention, 1860, Mr. Lincoln replied:\r\n\r\n“No, gentlemen; I have not asked the nomination, and I will not now buy\r\nit with pledges.\r\n\r\n“If I am nominated and elected, I shall not go into the Presidency as\r\nthe tool of this man or that man, or as the property of any factor or\r\nclique.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE ENVIED THE SOLDIER AT THE FRONT.\r\n\r\nAfter some very bad news had come in from the army in the field, Lincoln\r\nremarked to Schuyler Colfax:\r\n\r\n“How willingly would I exchange places to-day with the soldier who\r\nsleeps on the ground in the Army of the Potomac!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDON’T TRUST TOO FAR\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1852, Lincoln, in reply to Douglas’ speech, wherein\r\nhe spoke of confidence in Providence, replied: “Let us stand by our\r\ncandidate (General Scott) as faithfully as he has always stood by our\r\ncountry, and I much doubt if we do not perceive a slight abatement of\r\nJudge Douglas’ confidence in Providence as well as the people. I suspect\r\nthat confidence is not more firmly fixed with the judge than it was with\r\nthe old woman whose horse ran away with her in a buggy. She said she\r\n‘trusted in Providence till the britchen broke,’ and then she ‘didn’t\r\nknow what in airth to do.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE’D “RISK THE DICTATORSHIP.”\r\n\r\nLincoln’s great generosity to his leaders was shown when, in January,\r\n1863, he assigned “Fighting Joe” Hooker to the command of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac. Hooker had believed in a military dictatorship, and it was\r\nan open secret that McClellan might have become such had he possessed\r\nthe nerve. Lincoln, however, was not bothered by this prattle, as he\r\ndid not think enough of it to relieve McClellan of his command. The\r\nPresident said to Hooker:\r\n\r\n“I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying\r\nthat both the army and the Government needed a dictator. Of course, it\r\nwas not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the command.\r\nOnly those generals who gain success can be dictators.\r\n\r\n“What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the\r\ndictatorship.”\r\n\r\nLincoln also believed Hooker had not given cordial support to General\r\nBurnside when he was in command of the army. In Lincoln’s own peculiarly\r\nplain language, he told Hooker that he had done “a great wrong to the\r\ncountry and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MAJOR GENERAL, I RECKON.”\r\n\r\nAt one time the President had the appointment of a large additional\r\nnumber of brigadier and major generals. Among the immense number of\r\napplications, Mr. Lincoln came upon one wherein the claims of a certain\r\nworthy (not in the service at all), “for a generalship” were glowingly\r\nset forth. But the applicant didn’t specify whether he wanted to be\r\nbrigadier or major general.\r\n\r\nThe President observed this difficulty, and solved it by a lucid\r\nindorsement. The clerk, on receiving the paper again, found written\r\nacross its back, “Major General, I reckon. A. Lincoln.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOULD SEE THE TRACKS.\r\n\r\nJudge Herndon, Lincoln’s law partner, said that he never saw Lincoln\r\nmore cheerful than on the day previous to his departure from Springfield\r\nfor Washington, and Judge Gillespie, who visited him a few days earlier,\r\nfound him in excellent spirits.\r\n\r\n“I told him that I believed it would do him good to get down to\r\nWashington,” said Herndon.\r\n\r\n“I know it will,” Lincoln replied. “I only wish I could have got there\r\nto lock the door before the horse was stolen. But when I get to the\r\nspot, I can find the tracks.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” GAVE HER A “SURE TIP.”\r\n\r\nIf all the days Lincoln attended school were added together, they would\r\nnot make a single year’s time, and he never studied grammar or geography\r\nor any of the higher branches. His first teacher in Indiana was Hazel\r\nDorsey, who opened a school in a log schoolhouse a mile and a half\r\nfrom the Lincoln cabin. The building had holes for windows, which were\r\ncovered over with greased paper to admit light. The roof was just high\r\nenough for a man to stand erect. It did not take long to demonstrate\r\nthat “Abe” was superior to any scholar in his class. His next teacher\r\nwas Andrew Crawford, who taught in the winter of 1822-3, in the same\r\nlittle schoolhouse. “Abe” was an excellent speller, and it is said that\r\nhe liked to show off his knowledge, especially if he could help out\r\nhis less fortunate schoolmates. One day the teacher gave out the word\r\n“defied.” A large class was on the floor, but it seemed that no one\r\nwould be able to spell it. The teacher declared he would keep the whole\r\nclass in all day and night if “defied” was not spelled correctly.\r\n\r\nWhen the word came around to Katy Roby, she was standing where she\r\ncould see young “Abe.” She started, “d-e-f,” and while trying to decide\r\nwhether to spell the word with an “i” or a “y,” she noticed that Abe had\r\nhis finger on his eye and a smile on his face, and instantly took the\r\nhint. She spelled the word correctly and school was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT HAD KNOWLEDGE OF HIM.\r\n\r\nLincoln never forgot anyone or anything.\r\n\r\nAt one of the afternoon receptions at the White House a stranger shook\r\nhands with him, and, as he did so, remarked casually, that he was\r\nelected to Congress about the time Mr. Lincoln’s term as representative\r\nexpired, which happened many years before.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the President, “You are from--” (mentioning the State).\r\n“I remember reading of your election in a newspaper one morning on a\r\nsteamboat going down to Mount Vernon.”\r\n\r\nAt another time a gentleman addressed him, saying, “I presume, Mr.\r\nPresident, you have forgotten me?”\r\n\r\n“No,” was the prompt reply; “your name is Flood. I saw you last, twelve\r\nyears ago, at--” (naming the place and the occasion).\r\n\r\n“I am glad to see,” he continued, “that the Flood goes on.”\r\n\r\nSubsequent to his re-election a deputation of bankers from various\r\nsections were introduced one day by the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments of general conversation, Lincoln turned to one of\r\nthem and said:\r\n\r\n“Your district did not give me so strong a vote at the last election as\r\nit did in 1860.”\r\n\r\n“I think, sir, that you must be mistaken,” replied the banker. “I have\r\nthe impression that your majority was considerably increased at the last\r\nelection.”\r\n\r\n“No,” rejoined the President, “you fell off about six hundred votes.”\r\n\r\nThen taking down from the bookcase the official canvass of 1860 and\r\n1864, he referred to the vote of the district named, and proved to be\r\nquite right in his assertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONLY HALF A MAN.\r\n\r\nAs President Lincoln, arm in arm with ex-President Buchanan, entered the\r\nCapitol, and passed into the Senate Chamber, filled to overflowing with\r\nSenators, members of the Diplomatic Corps, and visitors, the contrast\r\nbetween the two men struck every observer.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Buchanan was so withered and bowed with age,” wrote George W.\r\nJulian, of Indiana, who was among the spectators, “that in contrast with\r\nthe towering form of Mr. Lincoln he seemed little more than half a man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT CONGRATULATED LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the result of the Presidential election of 1864 was known,\r\nGeneral Grant telegraphed from City Point his congratulations, and added\r\nthat “the election having passed off quietly... is a victory worth more\r\nto the country than a battle won.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“BRUTUS AND CAESAR.”\r\n\r\nLondon “Punch” persistently maintained throughout the War for the Union\r\nthat the question of what to do with the blacks was the most bothersome\r\nof all the problems President Lincoln had to solve. “Punch” thought the\r\nRebellion had its origin in an effort to determine whether there should\r\nor should not be slavery in the United States, and was fought with this\r\nas the main end in view. “Punch” of August 15th, 1863, contained the\r\ncartoon reproduced on this page, the title being “Brutus and Caesar.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was pictured as Brutus, while the ghost of Caesar,\r\nwhich appeared in the tent of the American Brutus during the dark hours\r\nof the night, was represented in the shape of a husky and anything but\r\nghost-like African, whose complexion would tend to make the blackest\r\ntar look like skimmed milk in comparison. This was the text below the\r\ncartoon: (From the American Edition of Shakespeare.) The Tent of Brutus\r\n(Lincoln). Night. Enter the Ghost of Caesar.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS: “Wall, now! Do tell! Who’s you?”\r\n\r\nCAESAR: “I am dy ebil genus, Massa Linking. Dis child am awful\r\nimpressional!”\r\n\r\n“Punch’s” cartoons were decidedly unfriendly in tone toward President\r\nLincoln, some of them being not only objectionable in the display of bad\r\ntaste, but offensive and vulgar. It is true that after the assassination\r\nof the President, “Punch,” in illustrations, paid marked and deserved\r\ntribute to the memory of the Great Emancipator, but it had little that\r\nwas good to say of him while he was among the living and engaged in\r\ncarrying out the great work for which he was destined to win eternal\r\nfame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW STANTON GOT INTO THE CABINET.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, well aware of Stanton’s unfriendliness, was surprised\r\nwhen Secretary of the Treasury Chase told him that Stanton had expressed\r\nthe opinion that the arrest of the Confederate Commissioners, Mason and\r\nSlidell, was legal and justified by international law. The President\r\nasked Secretary Chase to invite Stanton to the White House, and Stanton\r\ncame. Mr. Lincoln thanked him for the opinion he had expressed, and\r\nasked him to put it in writing.\r\n\r\nStanton complied, the President read it carefully, and, after putting\r\nit away, astounded Stanton by offering him the portfolio of War.\r\nStanton was a Democrat, had been one of the President’s most persistent\r\nvilifiers, and could not realize, at first, that Lincoln meant what he\r\nsaid. He managed, however to say:\r\n\r\n“I am both surprised and embarrassed, Mr. President, and would ask a\r\ncouple of days to consider this most important matter.”\r\n\r\nLincoln fully understood what was going on in Stanton’s mind, and then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“This is a very critical period in the life of the nation, Mr. Stanton,\r\nas you are well aware, and I well know you are as much interested in\r\nsustaining the government as myself or any other man. This is no time to\r\nconsider mere party issues. The life of the nation is in danger. I\r\nneed the best counsellors around me. I have every confidence in your\r\njudgment, and have concluded to ask you to become one of my counsellors.\r\nThe office of the Secretary of War will soon be vacant, and I am anxious\r\nto have you take Mr. Cameron’s place.”\r\n\r\nStanton decided to accept.\r\n\r\n“ABE” LIKE HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\n“Abe” Lincoln’s father was never at loss for an answer. An old neighbor\r\nof Thomas Lincoln--“Abe’s” father--was passing the Lincoln farm one day,\r\nwhen he saw “Abe’s” father grubbing up some hazelnut bushes, and said to\r\nhim: “Why, Grandpap, I thought you wanted to sell your farm?”\r\n\r\n“And so I do,” he replied, “but I ain’t goin’ to let my farm know it.”\r\n\r\n“‘Abe’s’ jes’ like his father,” the old ones would say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“NO MOON AT ALL.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable of Lincoln’s law cases was that in which he\r\ndefended William D. Armstrong, charged with murder. The case was one\r\nwhich was watched during its progress with intense interest, and it had\r\na most dramatic ending.\r\n\r\nThe defendant was the son of Jack and Hannah Armstrong. The father was\r\ndead, but Hannah, who had been very motherly and helpful to Lincoln\r\nduring his life at New Salem, was still living, and asked Lincoln to\r\ndefend him. Young Armstrong had been a wild lad, and was often in bad\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe principal witness had sworn that he saw young Armstrong strike the\r\nfatal blow, the moon being very bright at the time.\r\n\r\nLincoln brought forward the almanac, which showed that at the time\r\nthe murder was committed there was no moon at all. In his argument,\r\nLincoln’s speech was so feelingly made that at its close all the men\r\nin the jury-box were in tears. It was just half an hour when the jury\r\nreturned a verdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\nLincoln would accept no fee except the thanks of the anxious mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” A SUPERB MIMIC.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s reading in his early days embraced a wide range. He was\r\nparticularly fond of all stories containing fun, wit and humor, and\r\nevery one of these he came across he learned by heart, thus adding to\r\nhis personal store.\r\n\r\nHe improved as a reciter and retailer of the stories he had read and\r\nheard, and as the reciter of tales of his own invention, and he had\r\nready and eager auditors.\r\n\r\nJudge Herndon, in his “Abraham Lincoln,” relates that as a mimic Lincoln\r\nwas unequalled. An old neighbor said: “His laugh was striking. Such\r\nawkward gestures belonged to no other man. They attracted universal\r\nattention, from the old and sedate down to the schoolboy. Then, in a few\r\nmoments, he was as calm and thoughtful as a judge on the bench, and as\r\nready to give advice on the most important matters; fun and gravity grew\r\non him alike.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY HE WAS CALLED “HONEST ABE.”\r\n\r\nDuring the year Lincoln was in Denton Offutt’s store at New Salem, that\r\ngentleman, whose business was somewhat widely and unwisely spread about\r\nthe country, ceased to prosper in his finances and finally failed. The\r\nstore was shut up, the mill was closed, and Abraham Lincoln was out of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe year had been one of great advance, in many respects. He had made\r\nnew and valuable acquaintances, read many books, mastered the grammar of\r\nhis own tongue, won multitudes of friends, and became ready for a step\r\nstill further in advance.\r\n\r\nThose who could appreciate brains respected him, and those whose ideas\r\nof a man related to his muscles were devoted to him. It was while he\r\nwas performing the work of the store that he acquired the sobriquet\r\nof “Honest Abe”--a characterization he never dishonored, and an\r\nabbreviation that he never outgrew.\r\n\r\nHe was judge, arbitrator, referee, umpire, authority, in all disputes,\r\ngames and matches of man-flesh, horse-flesh, a pacificator in all\r\nquarrels; everybody’s friend; the best-natured, the most sensible, the\r\nbest-informed, the most modest and unassuming, the kindest, gentlest,\r\nroughest, strongest, best fellow in all New Salem and the region round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE’S” NAME REMAINED ON THE SIGN.\r\n\r\nEnduring friendship and love of old associations were prominent\r\ncharacteristics of President Lincoln. When about to leave Springfield\r\nfor Washington, he went to the dingy little law office which had\r\nsheltered his saddest hours.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the couch, and said to his law partner, Judge Herndon:\r\n\r\n“Billy, you and I have been together for more than twenty years, and\r\nhave never passed a word. Will you let my name stay on the old sign\r\nuntil I come back from Washington?”\r\n\r\nThe tears started to Herndon’s eyes. He put out his hand. “Mr. Lincoln,”\r\n said he, “I never will have any other partner while you live”; and to\r\nthe day of assassination, all the doings of the firm were in the name of\r\n“Lincoln & Herndon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY HOMELY AT FIRST SIGHT.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1861, Colonel Alex. K. McClure, of Philadelphia,\r\nreceived a telegram from President-elect Lincoln, asking him (McClure)\r\nto visit him at Springfield, Illinois. Colonel McClure described his\r\ndisappointment at first sight of Lincoln in these words:\r\n\r\n“I went directly from the depot to Lincoln’s house and rang the bell,\r\nwhich was answered by Lincoln himself opening the door. I doubt whether\r\na wholly concealed my disappointment at meeting him.\r\n\r\n“Tall, gaunt, ungainly, ill clad, with a homeliness of manner that was\r\nunique in itself, I confess that my heart sank within me as I remembered\r\nthat this was the man chosen by a great nation to become its ruler in\r\nthe gravest period of its history.\r\n\r\n“I remember his dress as if it were but yesterday--snuff-colored and\r\nslouchy pantaloons, open black vest, held by a few brass buttons;\r\nstraight or evening dresscoat, with tightly fitting sleeves to\r\nexaggerate his long, bony arms, and all supplemented by an awkwardness\r\nthat was uncommon among men of intelligence.\r\n\r\n“Such was the picture I met in the person of Abraham Lincoln. We sat\r\ndown in his plainly furnished parlor, and were uninterrupted during the\r\nnearly four hours that I remained with him, and little by little, as\r\nhis earnestness, sincerity and candor were developed in conversation, I\r\nforgot all the grotesque qualities which so confounded me when I first\r\ngreeted him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN TO TRUST.\r\n\r\n“If a man is honest in his mind,” said Lincoln one day, long before he\r\nbecame President, “you are pretty safe in trusting him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“WUZ GOIN’ TER BE ‘HITCHED.”’\r\n\r\n“Abe’s” nephew--or one of them--related a story in connection with\r\nLincoln’s first love (Anne Rutledge), and his subsequent marriage to\r\nMiss Mary Todd. This nephew was a plain, every-day farmer, and\r\nthought everything of his uncle, whose greatness he quite thoroughly\r\nappreciated, although he did not pose to any extreme as the relative of\r\na President of the United States.\r\n\r\nSaid he one day, in telling his story:\r\n\r\n“Us child’en, w’en we heerd Uncle ‘Abe’ wuz a-goin’ to be married, axed\r\nGran’ma ef Uncle ‘Abe’ never hed hed a gal afore, an’ she says, sez she,\r\n‘Well, “Abe” wuz never a han’ nohow to run ‘round visitin’ much, or go\r\nwith the gals, neither, but he did fall in love with a Anne Rutledge,\r\nwho lived out near Springfield, an’ after she died he’d come home an’\r\nev’ry time he’d talk ‘bout her, he cried dreadful. He never could talk\r\nof her nohow ‘thout he’d jes’ cry an’ cry, like a young feller.’\r\n\r\n“Onct he tol’ Gran’ma they wuz goin’ ter be hitched, they havin’\r\npromised each other, an’ thet is all we ever heered ‘bout it. But, so\r\nit wuz, that arter Uncle ‘Abe’ hed got over his mournin’, he wuz married\r\nter a woman w’ich hed lived down in Kentuck.\r\n\r\n“Uncle ‘Abe’ hisself tol’ us he wuz married the nex’ time he come up ter\r\nour place, an’ w’en we ast him why he didn’t bring his wife up to see\r\nus, he said: ‘She’s very busy and can’t come.’\r\n\r\n“But we knowed better’n that. He wuz too proud to bring her up, ’cause\r\nnothin’ would suit her, nohow. She wuzn’t raised the way we wuz, an’ wuz\r\ndifferent from us, and we heerd, tu, she wuz as proud as cud be.\r\n\r\n“No, an’ he never brought none uv the child’en, neither.\r\n\r\n“But then, Uncle ‘Abe,’ he wuzn’t to blame. We never thought he wuz\r\nstuck up.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE PROPOSED TO SAVE THE UNION.\r\n\r\nReplying to an editorial written by Horace Greeley, the President wrote:\r\n\r\n“My paramount object is to save the Union, and not either to save or to\r\ndestroy slavery.\r\n\r\n“If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it.\r\n\r\n“If I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I\r\ncould do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n“What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it\r\nhelps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not\r\nbelieve it would help to save the Union.\r\n\r\n“I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the\r\ncause, and I shall do more whenever I believe doing more will help the\r\ncause.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAME OLD RUM.\r\n\r\nOne of President Lincoln’s friends, visiting at the White House, was\r\nfinding considerable fault with the constant agitation in Congress\r\nof the slavery question. He remarked that, after the adoption of the\r\nEmancipation policy, he had hoped for something new.\r\n\r\n“There was a man down in Maine,” said the President, in reply, “who\r\nkept a grocery store, and a lot of fellows used to loaf around for\r\ntheir toddy. He only gave ‘em New England rum, and they drank pretty\r\nconsiderable of it. But after awhile they began to get tired of that,\r\nand kept asking for something new--something new--all the time. Well,\r\none night, when the whole crowd were around, the grocer brought out his\r\nglasses, and says he, ‘I’ve got something New for you to drink, boys,\r\nnow.’\r\n\r\n“‘Honor bright?’ said they.\r\n\r\n“‘Honor bright,’ says he, and with that he sets out a jug. ‘Thar’ says\r\nhe, ‘that’s something new; it’s New England rum!’ says he.\r\n\r\n“Now,” remarked the President, in conclusion, “I guess we’re a good deal\r\nlike that crowd, and Congress is a good deal like that store-keeper!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVED LINCOLN’S LIFE\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln was quite a small boy he met with an accident that\r\nalmost cost him his life. He was saved by Austin Gollaher, a young\r\nplaymate. Mr. Gollaher lived to be more than ninety years of age, and\r\nto the day of his death related with great pride his boyhood association\r\nwith Lincoln.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Mr. Gollaher once said, “the story that I once saved Abraham\r\nLincoln’s life is true. He and I had been going to school together for a\r\nyear or more, and had become greatly attached to each other. Then school\r\ndisbanded on account of there being so few scholars, and we did not see\r\neach other much for a long while.\r\n\r\n“One Sunday my mother visited the Lincolns, and I was taken along. ‘Abe’\r\nand I played around all day. Finally, we concluded to cross the creek\r\nto hunt for some partridges young Lincoln had seen the day before.\r\nThe creek was swollen by a recent rain, and, in crossing on the narrow\r\nfootlog, ‘Abe’ fell in. Neither of us could swim. I got a long pole and\r\nheld it out to ‘Abe,’ who grabbed it. Then I pulled him ashore.\r\n\r\n“He was almost dead, and I was badly scared. I rolled and pounded him\r\nin good earnest. Then I got him by the arms and shook him, the water\r\nmeanwhile pouring out of his mouth. By this means I succeeded in\r\nbringing him to, and he was soon all right.\r\n\r\n“Then a new difficulty confronted us. If our mothers discovered our\r\nwet clothes they would whip us. This we dreaded from experience, and\r\ndetermined to avoid. It was June, the sun was very warm, and we soon\r\ndried our clothing by spreading it on the rocks about us. We promised\r\nnever to tell the story, and I never did until after Lincoln’s tragic\r\nend.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOULD NOT RECALL A SINGLE WORD.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with some friends at the White House on New Year’s\r\nevening, 1863, President Lincoln said, concerning his Emancipation\r\nProclamation:\r\n\r\n“The signature looks a little tremulous, for my hand was tired, but my\r\nresolution was firm.\r\n\r\n“I told them in September, if they did not return to their allegiance,\r\nand cease murdering our soldiers, I would strike at this pillar of their\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“And now the promise shall be kept, and not one word of it will I ever\r\nrecall.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD BROOM BEST AFTER ALL.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the enemies of General Grant were making their bitterest\r\nattacks upon him, and demanding that the President remove him from\r\ncommand, “Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper,” of June 13, 1863, came\r\nout with the cartoon reproduced. The text printed under the picture was\r\nto the following effect:\r\n\r\nOLD ABE: “Greeley be hanged! I want no more new brooms. I begin to think\r\nthat the worst thing about my old ones was in not being handled right.”\r\n\r\nThe old broom the President holds in his right hand is labeled “Grant.”\r\n The latter had captured Fort Donelson, defeated the Confederates at\r\nShiloh, Iuka, Port Gibson, and other places, and had Vicksburg in his\r\niron grasp. When the demand was made that Lincoln depose Grant, the\r\nPresident answered, “I can’t spare this man; he fights!” Grant never\r\nlost a battle and when he found the enemy he always fought him.\r\nMcClellan, Burnside, Pope and Hooker had been found wanting, so Lincoln\r\npinned his faith to Grant. As noted in the cartoon, Horace Greeley,\r\neditor of the New York Tribune, Thurlow Weed, and others wanted Lincoln\r\nto try some other new brooms, but President Lincoln was wearied with\r\ndefeats, and wanted a few victories to offset them. Therefore; he stood\r\nby Grant, who gave him victories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOD WITH A LITTLE “g.”\r\n\r\n     Abraham Lincoln\r\n       his hand and pen\r\n     he will be good\r\n       but god Knows When\r\n\r\nThese lines were found written in young Lincoln’s own hand at the bottom\r\nof a page whereon he had been ciphering. Lincoln always wrote a clear,\r\nregular “fist.” In this instance he evidently did not appreciate the\r\nsacredness of the name of the Deity, when he used a little “g.”\r\n\r\nLincoln once said he did not remember the time when he could not write.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE’S” LOG.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in Sangamon for the “menfolks” to gather at noon and\r\nin the evening, when resting, in a convenient lane near the mill. They\r\nhad rolled out a long peeled log, on which they lounged while they\r\nwhittled and talked.\r\n\r\nLincoln had not been long in Sangamon before he joined this circle. At\r\nonce he became a favorite by his jokes and good-humor. As soon as\r\nhe appeared at the assembly ground the men would start him to\r\nstory-telling. So irresistibly droll were his “yarns” that whenever he’d\r\nend up in his unexpected way the boys on the log would whoop and roll\r\noff. The result of the rolling off was to polish the log like a mirror.\r\nThe men, recognizing Lincoln’s part in this polishing, christened their\r\nseat “Abe’s log.”\r\n\r\nLong after Lincoln had disappeared from Sangamon, “Abe’s log” remained,\r\nand until it had rotted away people pointed it out, and repeated the\r\ndroll stories of the stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT WAS A FINE FIZZLE.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, in company with General Grant, was inspecting the\r\nDutch Gap Canal at City Point. “Grant, do you know what this reminds\r\nme of? Out in Springfield, Ill., there was a blacksmith who, not having\r\nmuch to do, took a piece of soft iron and attempted to weld it into an\r\nagricultural implement, but discovered that the iron would not hold out;\r\nthen he concluded it would make a claw hammer; but having too much iron,\r\nattempted to make an ax, but decided after working awhile that there was\r\nnot enough iron left. Finally, becoming disgusted, he filled the forge\r\nfull of coal and brought the iron to a white heat; then with his tongs\r\nhe lifted it from the bed of coals, and thrusting it into a tub of water\r\nnear by, exclaimed: ‘Well, if I can’t make anything else of you, I will\r\nmake a fizzle, anyhow.’” “I was afraid that was about what we had done\r\nwith the Dutch Gap Canal,” said General Grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TEETOTALER.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln was in the Black Hawk War as captain, the volunteer\r\nsoldiers drank in with delight the jests and stories of the tall\r\ncaptain. Aesop’s Fables were given a new dress, and the tales of the\r\nwild adventures that he had brought from Kentucky and Indiana were many,\r\nbut his inspiration was never stimulated by recourse to the whisky jug.\r\n\r\nWhen his grateful and delighted auditors pressed this on him he had one\r\nreply: “Thank you, I never drink it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT TO “OPEN SHOP” THERE.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was passing down Pennsylvania avenue in Washington one\r\nday, when a man came running after him, hailed him, and thrust a bundle\r\nof papers in his hands.\r\n\r\nIt angered him not a little, and he pitched the papers back, saying,\r\n“I’m not going to open shop here.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE HAVE LIBERTY OF ALL KINDS.\r\n\r\nLincoln delivered a remarkable speech at Springfield, Illinois, when but\r\ntwenty-eight years of age, upon the liberty possessed by the people of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn part, he said:\r\n\r\n“In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the\r\nAmerican people, find our account running under date of the nineteenth\r\ncentury of the Christian era.\r\n\r\n“We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion\r\nof the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and\r\nsalubrity of climate.\r\n\r\n“We find ourselves under the government of a system of political\r\ninstitutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and\r\nreligious liberty than any of which history of former times tells us.\r\n\r\n“We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves the legal\r\ninheritors of these fundamental blessings.\r\n\r\n“We toiled not in the acquisition or establishment of them; they are a\r\nlegacy bequeathed to us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now\r\nlamented and departed race of ancestors.\r\n\r\n“Theirs was the task (and nobly did they perform it) to possess\r\nthemselves, us, of this goodly land, to uprear upon its hills and\r\nvalleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; ‘tis ours to\r\ntransmit these--the former unprofaned by the foot of an intruder, the\r\nlatter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation--to the\r\ngeneration that fate shall permit the world to know.\r\n\r\n“This task, gratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to\r\nposterity--all imperatively require us faithfully to perform.\r\n\r\n“How, then, shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the\r\napproach of danger?\r\n\r\n“Shall we expect some trans-Atlantic military giant to step the ocean\r\nand crush us at a blow?\r\n\r\n“Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa, combined, with all\r\nthe treasures of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest,\r\nwith a Bonaparte for a commander, could not, by force, take a drink from\r\nthe Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n“At what point, then, is this approach of danger to be expected?\r\n\r\n“I answer, if ever it reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot\r\ncome from abroad.\r\n\r\n“If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and\r\nfinisher.\r\n\r\n“As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time or die by\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n“I hope I am not over-wary; but, if I am not, there is even now\r\nsomething of ill-omen amongst us.\r\n\r\n“I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country, the\r\ndisposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of\r\nthe sober judgment of courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the\r\nexecutive ministers of justice.\r\n\r\n“This disposition is awfully fearful in any community, and that it now\r\nexists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit it, it would be\r\na violation of truth and an insult to deny.\r\n\r\n“Accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the every-day news of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n“They have pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana; they are\r\nneither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning sun\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\n“They are not the creatures of climate, neither are they confined to the\r\nslave-holding or non-slave-holding States.\r\n\r\n“Alike they spring up among the pleasure-hunting Southerners and the\r\norder-loving citizens of the land of steady habits.\r\n\r\n“Whatever, then, their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.\r\n\r\n“Many great and good men, sufficiently qualified for any task they may\r\nundertake, may ever be found, whose ambition would aspire to nothing\r\nbeyond a seat in Congress, a gubernatorial or Presidential chair; but\r\nsuch belong not to the family of the lion, or the tribe of the eagle.\r\n\r\n“What! Think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a\r\nNapoleon? Never!\r\n\r\n“Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto\r\nunexplored.\r\n\r\n“It seeks no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of\r\nfame, erected to the memory of others.\r\n\r\n“It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief.\r\n\r\n“It scorns to tread in the footpaths of any predecessor, however\r\nillustrious.\r\n\r\n“It thirsts and burns for distinction, and, if possible, it will have\r\nit, whether at the expense of emancipating the slaves or enslaving\r\nfreemen.\r\n\r\n“Another reason which once was, but which to the same extent is now no\r\nmore, has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far.\r\n\r\n“I mean the powerful influence which the interesting scenes of the\r\nRevolution had upon the passions of the people, as distinguished from\r\ntheir judgment.\r\n\r\n“But these histories are gone. They can be read no more forever. They\r\nwere a fortress of strength.\r\n\r\n“But what the invading foeman could never do, the silent artillery of\r\ntime has done, the levelling of the walls.\r\n\r\n“They were a forest of giant oaks, but the all-resisting hurricane swept\r\nover them and left only here and there a lone trunk, despoiled of its\r\nverdure, shorn of its foliage, unshading and unshaded, to murmur in a\r\nfew more gentle breezes and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few\r\nmore rude storms, then to sink and be no more.\r\n\r\n“They were the pillars of the temple of liberty, and now that they have\r\ncrumbled away, that temple must fall, unless we, the descendants, supply\r\nthe places with pillars hewn from the same solid quarry of sober reason.\r\n\r\n“Passion has helped us, but can do so no more. It will in future be our\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n“Reason--cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason--must furnish all the\r\nmaterials for our support and defense.\r\n\r\n“Let those materials be molded into general intelligence, sound\r\nmorality, and, in particular, a reverence for the Constitution and the\r\nlaws; and then our country shall continue to improve, and our nation,\r\nrevering his name, and permitting no hostile foot to pass or desecrate\r\nhis resting-place, shall be the first to hear the last trump that shall\r\nawaken our Washington.\r\n\r\n“Upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest as the rock of its\r\nbasis, and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution,\r\n‘the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM CORWINS’S LATEST STORY.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Lincoln’s warm friends was Dr. Robert Boal, of Lacon,\r\nIllinois. Telling of a visit he paid to the White House soon after Mr.\r\nLincoln’s inauguration, he said: “I found him the same Lincoln as a\r\nstruggling lawyer and politician that I did in Washington as President\r\nof the United States, yet there was a dignity and self-possession about\r\nhim in his high official authority. I paid him a second call in the\r\nevening. He had thrown off his reserve somewhat, and would walk up and\r\ndown the room with his hands to his sides and laugh at the joke he was\r\ntelling, or at one that was told to him. I remember one story he told to\r\nme on this occasion.\r\n\r\n“Tom Corwin, of Ohio, had been down to Alexandria, Va., that day and\r\nhad come back and told Lincoln a story which pleased him so much that\r\nhe broke out in a hearty laugh and said: ‘I must tell you Tom Corwin’s\r\nlatest. Tom met an old man at Alexandria who knew George Washington, and\r\nhe told Tom that George Washington often swore. Now, Corwin’s father had\r\nalways held the father of our country up as a faultless person and told\r\nhis son to follow in his footsteps.\r\n\r\n“‘“Well,” said Corwin, “when I heard that George Washington was addicted\r\nto the vices and infirmities of man, I felt so relieved that I just\r\nshouted for joy.”’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“CATCH ‘EM AND CHEAT ‘EM.”\r\n\r\nThe lawyers on the circuit traveled by Lincoln got together one night\r\nand tried him on the charge of accepting fees which tended to lower\r\nthe established rates. It was the understood rule that a lawyer should\r\naccept all the client could be induced to pay. The tribunal was known as\r\n“The Ogmathorial Court.”\r\n\r\nWard Lamon, his law partner at the time, tells about it:\r\n\r\n“Lincoln was found guilty and fined for his awful crime against the\r\npockets of his brethren of the bar. The fine he paid with great good\r\nhumor, and then kept the crowd of lawyers in uproarious laughter until\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\n“He persisted in his revolt, however, declaring that with his consent\r\nhis firm should never during its life, or after its dissolution, deserve\r\nthe reputation enjoyed by those shining lights of the profession, ‘Catch\r\n‘em and Cheat ‘em.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JURYMAN’S SCORN.\r\n\r\nLincoln had assisted in the prosecution of a man who had robbed his\r\nneighbor’s hen roosts. Jogging home along the highway with the foreman\r\nof the jury that had convicted the hen stealer, he was complimented by\r\nLincoln on the zeal and ability of the prosecution, and remarked: “Why,\r\nwhen the country was young, and I was stronger than I am now, I didn’t\r\nmind packing off a sheep now and again, but stealing hens!” The good\r\nman’s scorn could not find words to express his opinion of a man who\r\nwould steal hens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE “BROKE” TO WIN.\r\n\r\nA lawyer, who was a stranger to Mr. Lincoln, once expressed to General\r\nLinder the opinion that Mr. Lincoln’s practice of telling stories to the\r\njury was a waste of time.\r\n\r\n“Don’t lay that flattering unction to your soul,” Linder answered;\r\n“Lincoln is like Tansey’s horse, he ‘breaks to win.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED HER CHILDREN BACK.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of January, 1863, “Harper’s Weekly” appeared with a cartoon\r\nrepresenting Columbia indignantly demanding of President Lincoln and\r\nSecretary of War Stanton that they restore to her those of her sons\r\nkilled in battle. Below the picture is the reading matter:\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA: “Where are my 15,000 sons--murdered at Fredericksburg?”\r\n\r\nLINCOLN: “This reminds me of a little joke--”\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA: “Go tell your joke at Springfield!!”\r\n\r\nThe battle of Fredericksburg was fought on December 13th, 1862, between\r\nGeneral Burnside, commanding the Army of the Potomac, and General Lee’s\r\nforce. The Union troops, time and again, assaulted the heights where\r\nthe Confederates had taken position, but were driven back with frightful\r\nlosses. The enemy, being behind breastworks, suffered comparatively\r\nlittle. At the beginning of the fight the Confederate line was broken,\r\nbut the result of the engagement was disastrous to the Union cause.\r\nBurnside had one thousand one hundred and fifty-two killed, nine\r\nthousand one hundred and one wounded, and three thousand two hundred\r\nand thirty-four missing, a total of thirteen thousand seven hundred and\r\nseventy-one. General Lee’s losses, all told, were not much more than\r\nfive thousand men.\r\n\r\nBurnside had succeeded McClellan in command of the Army of the Potomac,\r\nmainly, it was said, through the influence of Secretary of War Stanton.\r\nThree months before, McClellan had defeated Lee at Antietam, the\r\nbloodiest battle of the War, Lee’s losses footing up more than thirteen\r\nthousand men. At Fredericksburg, Burnside had about one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand men; at Antietam, McClellan had about eighty thousand.\r\nIt has been maintained that Burnside should not have fought this battle,\r\nthe chances of success being so few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIX FEET FOUR AT SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\n“Abe’s” school teacher, Crawford, endeavored to teach his pupils some of\r\nthe manners of the “polite society” of Indiana--1823 or so. This was a\r\npart of his system:\r\n\r\nOne of the pupils would retire, and then come in as a stranger, and\r\nanother pupil would have to introduce him to all the members of the\r\nschool n what was considered “good manners.”\r\n\r\nAs “Abe” wore a linsey-woolsey shirt, buckskin breeches which were too\r\nshort and very tight, and low shoes, and was tall and awkward, he no\r\ndoubt created considerable merriment when his turn came. He was growing\r\nat a fearful rate; he was fifteen years of age, and two years later\r\nattained his full height of six feet four inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAD RESPECT FOR THE EGGS.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1831, “Abe” was one of the guests of honor at a boat-launching,\r\nhe and two others having built the craft. The affair was a notable one,\r\npeople being present from the territory surrounding. A large party came\r\nfrom Springfield with an ample supply of whisky, to give the boat and\r\nits builders a send-off. It was a sort of bipartisan mass-meeting, but\r\nthere was one prevailing spirit, that born of rye and corn. Speeches\r\nwere made in the best of feeling, some in favor of Andrew Jackson and\r\nsome in favor of Henry Clay. Abraham Lincoln, the cook, told a number\r\nof funny stories, and it is recorded that they were not of too refined a\r\ncharacter to suit the taste of his audience. A sleight-of-hand performer\r\nwas present, and among other tricks performed, he fried some eggs\r\nin Lincoln’s hat. Judge Herndon says, as explanatory to the delay in\r\npassing up the hat for the experiment, Lincoln drolly observed: “It was\r\nout of respect for the eggs, not care for my hat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WAS THE MILK UPSET?\r\n\r\nWilliam G. Greene, an old-time friend of Lincoln, was a student at\r\nIllinois College, and one summer brought home with him, on a vacation,\r\nRichard Yates (afterwards Governor of Illinois) and some other boys,\r\nand, in order to entertain them, took them up to see Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHe found him in his usual position and at his usual occupation--flat on\r\nhis back, on a cellar door, reading a newspaper. This was the manner in\r\nwhich a President of the United States and a Governor of Illinois became\r\nacquainted with each other.\r\n\r\nGreene says Lincoln repeated the whole of Burns, and a large quantity of\r\nShakespeare for the entertainment of the college boys, and, in return,\r\nwas invited to dine with them on bread and milk. How he managed to upset\r\nhis bowl of milk is not a matter of history, but the fact is that he\r\ndid so, as is the further fact that Greene’s mother, who loved\r\nLincoln, tried to smooth over the accident and relieve the young man’s\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“PULLED FODDER” FOR A BOOK.\r\n\r\nOnce “Abe” borrowed Weems’ “Life of Washington” from Joseph Crawford, a\r\nneighbor. “Abe” devoured it; read it and re-read it, and when asleep put\r\nit by him between the logs of the wall. One night a rain storm wet it\r\nthrough and ruined it.\r\n\r\n“I’ve no money,” said “Abe,” when reporting the disaster to Crawford,\r\n“but I’ll work it out.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” was Crawford’s response; “you pull fodder for three days,\r\nan’ the book is your’n.”\r\n\r\n“Abe” pulled the fodder, but he never forgave Crawford for putting so\r\nmuch work upon him. He never lost an opportunity to crack a joke at his\r\nexpense, and the name “Blue-nose Crawford” “Abe” applied to him stuck to\r\nhim throughout his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAISES HIS RIVAL FOR OFFICE.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln was a candidate for the Legislature, it was the\r\npractice at that date in Illinois for two rival candidates to travel\r\nover the district together. The custom led to much good-natured raillery\r\nbetween them; and in such contests Lincoln was rarely, if ever, worsted.\r\nHe could even turn the generosity of a rival to account by his whimsical\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, says Mr. Weir, a former resident of Sangamon county, he\r\nhad driven out from Springfield in company with a political opponent\r\nto engage in joint debate. The carriage, it seems, belonged to his\r\nopponent. In addressing the gathering of farmers that met them, Lincoln\r\nwas lavish in praise of the generosity of his friend.\r\n\r\n“I am too poor to own a carriage,” he said, “but my friend has\r\ngenerously invited me to ride with him. I want you to vote for me if you\r\nwill; but if not then vote for my opponent, for he is a fine man.”\r\n\r\nHis extravagant and persistent praise of his opponent appealed to the\r\nsense of humor in his rural audience, to whom his inability to own a\r\ncarriage was by no means a disqualification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE THING “ABE” DIDN’T LOVE.\r\n\r\nLincoln admitted that he was not particularly energetic when it came to\r\nreal hard work.\r\n\r\n“My father,” said he one day, “taught me how to work, but not to love\r\nit. I never did like to work, and I don’t deny it. I’d rather read, tell\r\nstories, crack jokes, talk, laugh--anything but work.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODESTY OF GENIUS.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the year 1860 found Mr. Lincoln’s name freely mentioned\r\nin connection with the Republican nomination for the Presidency. To be\r\nclassed with Seward, Chase, McLean, and other celebrities, was enough to\r\nstimulate any Illinois lawyer’s pride; but in Mr. Lincoln’s case, if it\r\nhad any such effect, he was most artful in concealing it. Now and then,\r\nsome ardent friend, an editor, for example, would run his name up to the\r\nmasthead, but in all cases he discouraged the attempt.\r\n\r\n“In regard to the matter you spoke of,” he answered one man who proposed\r\nhis name, “I beg you will not give it a further mention. Seriously, I do\r\nnot think I am fit for the Presidency.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SHE MARRIED HIM.\r\n\r\nThere was a “social” at Lincoln’s house in Springfield, and “Abe”\r\n introduced his wife to Ward Lamon, his law partner. Lamon tells the\r\nstory in these words:\r\n\r\n“After introducing me to Mrs. Lincoln, he left us in conversation. I\r\nremarked to her that her husband was a great favorite in the eastern\r\npart of the State, where I had been stopping.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ she replied, ‘he is a great favorite everywhere. He is to be\r\nPresident of the United States some day; if I had not thought so I never\r\nwould have married him, for you can see he is not pretty.\r\n\r\n“‘But look at him, doesn’t he look as if he would make a magnificent\r\nPresident?’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIAGARA FALLS.\r\n\r\n(Written By Abraham Lincoln.)\r\n\r\nThe following article on Niagara Falls, in Mr. Lincoln’s handwriting,\r\nwas found among his papers after his death:\r\n\r\n“Niagara Falls! By what mysterious power is it that millions and\r\nmillions are drawn from all parts of the world to gaze upon Niagara\r\nFalls? There is no mystery about the thing itself. Every effect is just\r\nas any intelligent man, knowing the causes, would anticipate without\r\nseeing it. If the water moving onward in a great river reaches a point\r\nwhere there is a perpendicular jog of a hundred feet in descent in\r\nthe bottom of the river, it is plain the water will have a violent\r\nand continuous plunge at that point. It is also plain, the water, thus\r\nplunging, will foam and roar, and send up a mist continuously, in\r\nwhich last, during sunshine, there will be perpetual rainbows. The mere\r\nphysical of Niagara Falls is only this. Yet this is really a very small\r\npart of that world’s wonder. Its power to excite reflection and emotion\r\nis its great charm. The geologist will demonstrate that the plunge, or\r\nfall, was once at Lake Ontario, and has worn its way back to its present\r\nposition; he will ascertain how fast it is wearing now, and so get\r\na basis for determining how long it has been wearing back from Lake\r\nOntario, and finally demonstrate by it that this world is at least\r\nfourteen thousand years old. A philosopher of a slightly different turn\r\nwill say, ‘Niagara Falls is only the lip of the basin out of which pours\r\nall the surplus water which rains down on two or three hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles of the earth’s surface.’ He will estimate with approximate\r\naccuracy that five hundred thousand tons of water fall with their full\r\nweight a distance of a hundred feet each minute--thus exerting a force\r\nequal to the lifting of the same weight, through the same space, in the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n“But still there is more. It calls up the indefinite past. When Columbus\r\nfirst sought this continent--when Christ suffered on the cross--when\r\nMoses led Israel through the Red Sea--nay, even when Adam first came\r\nfrom the hand of his Maker; then, as now, Niagara was roaring here. The\r\neyes of that species of extinct giants whose bones fill the mounds of\r\nAmerica have gazed on Niagara, as ours do now. Contemporary with the\r\nfirst race of men, and older than the first man, Niagara is strong and\r\nfresh to-day as ten thousand years ago. The Mammoth and Mastodon, so\r\nlong dead that fragments of their monstrous bones alone testify that\r\nthey ever lived, have gazed on Niagara--in that long, long time never\r\nstill for a single moment (never dried), never froze, never slept, never\r\nrested.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADE IT HOT FOR LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nA lady relative, who lived for two years with the Lincolns, said that\r\nMr. Lincoln was in the habit of lying on the floor with the back of a\r\nchair for a pillow when he read.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when in this position in the hall, a knock was heard at the\r\nfront door, and, although in his shirtsleeves, he answered the call. Two\r\nladies were at the door, whom he invited into the parlor, notifying them\r\nin his open, familiar way, that he would “trot the women folks out.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln, from an adjoining room, witnessed the ladies’ entrance,\r\nand, overhearing her husband’s jocose expression, her indignation was\r\nso instantaneous she made the situation exceedingly interesting for him,\r\nand he was glad to retreat from the house. He did not return till very\r\nlate at night, and then slipped quietly in at a rear door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOULDN’T HOLD TITLE AGAINST HIM.\r\n\r\nDuring the rebellion the Austrian Minister to the United States\r\nGovernment introduced to the President a count, a subject of the\r\nAustrian government, who was desirous of obtaining a position in the\r\nAmerican army.\r\n\r\nBeing introduced by the accredited Minister of Austria he required no\r\nfurther recommendation to secure the appointment; but, fearing that his\r\nimportance might not be fully appreciated by the republican President,\r\nthe count was particular in impressing the fact upon him that he bore\r\nthat title, and that his family was ancient and highly respectable.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln listened with attention, until this unnecessary\r\ncommendation was mentioned; then, with a merry twinkle in his eye, he\r\ntapped the aristocratic sprig of hereditary nobility on the shoulder in\r\nthe most fatherly way, as if the gentleman had made a confession of some\r\nunfortunate circumstance connected with his lineage, for which he was in\r\nno way responsible, and said:\r\n\r\n“Never mind, you shall be treated with just as much consideration for all\r\nthat. I will see to it that your bearing a title shan’t hurt you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONLY ONE LIFE TO LIVE.\r\n\r\nA young man living in Kentucky had been enticed into the rebel army.\r\nAfter a few months he became disgusted, and managed to make his way\r\nback home. Soon after his arrival, the Union officer in command of the\r\nmilitary stationed in the town had him arrested as a rebel spy, and,\r\nafter a military trial he was condemned to be hanged.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was seen by one of his friends from Kentucky, who\r\nexplained his errand and asked for mercy. “Oh, yes, I understand; some\r\none has been crying, and worked upon your feelings, and you have come\r\nhere to work on mine.”\r\n\r\nHis friend then went more into detail, and assured him of his belief in\r\nthe truth of the story. After some deliberation, Mr. Lincoln, evidently\r\nscarcely more than half convinced, but still preferring to err on the\r\nside of mercy, replied:\r\n\r\n“If a man had more than one life, I think a little hanging would not\r\nhurt this one; but after he is once dead we cannot bring him back, no\r\nmatter how sorry we may be; so the boy shall be pardoned.”\r\n\r\nAnd a reprieve was given on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOULDN’T LOCATE HIS BIRTHPLACE.\r\n\r\nWhile the celebrated artist, Hicks, was engaged in painting Mr.\r\nLincoln’s portrait, just after the former’s first nomination for the\r\nPresidency, he asked the great statesman if he could point out the\r\nprecise spot where he was born.\r\n\r\nLincoln thought the matter over for a day or two, and then gave the\r\nartist the following memorandum:\r\n\r\n“Springfield, Ill., June 14, 1860\r\n\r\n“I was born February 12, 1809, in then Hardin county, Kentucky, at a\r\npoint within the now county of Larue, a mile or a mile and a half from\r\nwhere Rodgen’s mill now is. My parents being dead, and my own memory not\r\nserving, I know no means of identifying the precise locality. It was on\r\nNolen Creek.\r\n\r\n“A. LINCOLN.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SAMBO” WAS “AFEARED.”\r\n\r\nIn his message to Congress in December, 1864, just after his\r\nre-election, President Lincoln, in his message of December 6th, let\r\nhimself out, in plain, unmistakable terms, to the effect that the\r\nfreedmen should never be placed in bondage again. “Frank Leslie’s\r\nIllustrated Newspaper” of December 24th, 1864, printed the cartoon we\r\nherewith reproduce, the text underneath running in this way:\r\n\r\nUNCLE ABE: “Sambo, you are not handsome, any more than myself, but as\r\nto sending you back to your old master, I’m not the man to do it--and,\r\nwhat’s more, I won’t.” (Vice President’s message.)\r\n\r\nCongress, at the previous sitting, had neglected to pass the resolution\r\nfor the Constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery, but, on the 31st\r\nof January, 1865, the resolution was finally adopted, and the United\r\nStates Constitution soon had the new feature as one of its clauses, the\r\nnecessary number of State Legislatures approving it. President Lincoln\r\nregarded the passage of this resolution by Congress as most important,\r\nas the amendment, in his mind, covered whatever defects a rigid\r\nconstruction of the Constitution might find in his Emancipation\r\nProclamation.\r\n\r\nAfter the latter was issued, negroes were allowed to enlist in the Army,\r\nand they fought well and bravely. After the War, in the reorganization\r\nof the Regular Army, four regiments of colored men were provided\r\nfor--the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry and the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth\r\nInfantry. In the cartoon, Sambo has evidently been asking “Uncle Abe” as\r\nto the probability or possibility of his being again enslaved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN MONEY MIGHT BE USED.\r\n\r\nSome Lincoln enthusiast in Kansas, with much more pretensions than\r\npower, wrote him in March, 1860 proposing to furnish a Lincoln\r\ndelegation from that State to the Chicago Convention, and suggesting\r\nthat Lincoln should pay the legitimate expenses of organizing, electing,\r\nand taking to the convention the promised Lincoln delegates.\r\n\r\nTo this Lincoln replied that “in the main, the use of money is wrong,\r\nbut for certain objects in a political contest the use of some is both\r\nright and indispensable.” And he added: “If you shall be appointed a\r\ndelegate to Chicago, I will furnish $100 to bear the expenses of the\r\ntrip.”\r\n\r\nHe heard nothing further from the Kansas man until he saw an\r\nannouncement in the newspapers that Kansas had elected delegates and\r\ninstructed them for Seward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” WAS NO BEAUTY.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s military service in the Back Hawk war had increased his\r\npopularity at New Salem, and he was put up as a candidate for the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nA. Y. Ellis describes his personal appearance at this time as follows:\r\n“He wore a mixed jean coat, claw-hammer style, short in the sleeves and\r\nbob-tailed; in fact, it was so short in the tail that he could not sit\r\non it; flax and tow linen pantaloons and a straw hat. I think he wore a\r\nvest, but do not remember how it looked; he wore pot-metal boots.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“HE’S JUST BEAUTIFUL.”\r\n\r\nLincoln’s great love for children easily won their confidence.\r\n\r\nA little girl, who had been told that the President was very homely, was\r\ntaken by her father to see the President at the White House.\r\n\r\nLincoln took her upon his knee and chatted with her for a moment in his\r\nmerry way, when she turned to her father and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Pa! he isn’t ugly at all; he’s just beautiful!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG ENOUGH HOG FOR HIM.\r\n\r\nTo a curiosity-seeker who desired a permit to pass the lines to\r\nvisit the field of Bull Run, after the first battle, Lincoln made the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n“A man in Cortlandt county raised a porker of such unusual size that\r\nstrangers went out of their way to see it.\r\n\r\n“One of them the other day met the old gentleman and inquired about the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n“‘Wall, yes,’ the old fellow said, ‘I’ve got such a critter, mi’ty big\r\nun; but I guess I’ll have to charge you about a shillin’ for lookin’ at\r\nhim.’\r\n\r\n“The stranger looked at the old man for a minute or so, pulled out the\r\ndesired coin, handed it to him and started to go off. ‘Hold on,’ said\r\nthe other, ‘don’t you want to see the hog?’\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ said the stranger; ‘I have seen as big a hog as I want to see!’\r\n\r\n“And you will find that fact the case with yourself, if you should\r\nhappen to see a few live rebels there as well as dead ones.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE” OFFERS A SPEECH FOR SOMETHING TO EAT.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln’s special train from Springfield to Washington reached the\r\nIllinois State line, there was a stop for dinner. There was such a crowd\r\nthat Lincoln could scarcely reach the dining-room. “Gentlemen,” said he,\r\nas he surveyed the crowd, “if you will make me a little path, so that I\r\ncan get through and get something to eat, I will make you a speech when\r\nI get back.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\nWhen complaints were made to President Lincoln by victims of\r\nSecretary of War Stanton’s harshness, rudeness, and refusal to be\r\nobliging--particularly in cases where Secretary Stanton had refused\r\nto honor Lincoln’s passes through the lines--the President would often\r\nremark to this effect “I cannot always be sure that permits given by\r\nme ought to be granted. There is an understanding between myself and\r\nStanton that when I send a request to him which cannot consistently be\r\ngranted, he is to refuse to honor it. This he sometimes does.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW FENCE RAILS LEFT.\r\n\r\n“There won’t be a tar barrel left in Illinois to-night,” said Senator\r\nStephen A. Douglas, in Washington, to his Senatorial friends, who asked\r\nhim, when the news of the nomination of Lincoln reached them, “Who is\r\nthis man Lincoln, anyhow?”\r\n\r\nDouglas was right. Not only the tar barrels, but half the fences of the\r\nState of Illinois went up in the fire of rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “GREAT SNOW” OF 1830-31.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of Lincoln’s great popularity, D. W. Bartlett, in his\r\n“Life and Speeches of Abraham Lincoln,” published in 1860 makes this\r\nstatement of “Abe’s” efficient service to his neighbors in the “Great\r\nSnow” of 1830-31:\r\n\r\n“The deep snow which occurred in 1830-31 was one of the chief troubles\r\nendured by the early settlers of central and southern Illinois. Its\r\nconsequences lasted through several years. The people were ill-prepared\r\nto meet it, as the weather had been mild and pleasant--unprecedentedly\r\nso up to Christmas--when a snow-storm set in which lasted two days,\r\nsomething never before known even among the traditions of the Indians,\r\nand never approached in the weather of any winter since.\r\n\r\n“The pioneers who came into the State (then a territory) in 1800 say the\r\naverage depth of snow was never, previous to 1830, more than knee-deep\r\nto an ordinary man, while it was breast-high all that winter.\r\nIt became crusted over, so as, in some cases, to bear teams. Cattle\r\nand horses perished, the winter wheat was killed, the meager stock of\r\nprovisions ran out, and during the three months’ continuance of the\r\nsnow, ice and continuous cold weather the most wealthy settlers came\r\nnear starving, while some of the poor ones actually did. It was in the\r\nmidst of such scenes that Abraham Lincoln attained his majority, and\r\ncommenced his career of bold and manly independence.....\r\n\r\n“Communication between house and house was often entirely obstructed for\r\nteams, so that the young and strong men had to do all the traveling on\r\nfoot; carrying from one neighbor what of his store he could spare to\r\nanother, and bringing back in return something of his store sorely\r\nneeded. Men living five, ten, twenty and thirty miles apart were called\r\n‘neighbors’ then. Young Lincoln was always ready to perform these acts\r\nof humanity, and was foremost in the counsels of the settlers when their\r\ntroubles seemed gathering like a thick cloud about them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITOR PAID DEBTORS DEBT.\r\n\r\nA certain rich man in Springfield, Illinois, sued a poor attorney for\r\n$2.50, and Lincoln was asked to prosecute the case. Lincoln urged the\r\ncreditor to let the matter drop, adding, “You can make nothing out of\r\nhim, and it will cost you a good deal more than the debt to bring suit.”\r\n The creditor was still determined to have his way, and threatened\r\nto seek some other attorney. Lincoln then said, “Well, if you are\r\ndetermined that suit should be brought, I will bring it; but my charge\r\nwill be $10.”\r\n\r\nThe money was paid him, and peremptory orders were given that the suit\r\nbe brought that day. After the client’s departure Lincoln went out of\r\nthe office, returning in about an hour with an amused look on his face.\r\n\r\nAsked what pleased him, he replied, “I brought suit against ----, and\r\nthen hunted him up, told him what I had done, handed him half of the\r\n$10, and we went over to the squire’s office. He confessed judgment and\r\npaid the bill.”\r\n\r\nLincoln added that he didn’t see any other way to make things\r\nsatisfactory for his client as well as the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPED OUT THE SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\nJudge Thomas B. Bryan, of Chicago, a member of the Union Defense\r\nCommittee during the War, related the following concerning the original\r\ncopy of the Emancipation Proclamation:\r\n\r\n“I asked Mr. Lincoln for the original draft of the Proclamation,” said\r\nJudge Bryan, “for the benefit of our Sanitary Fair, in 1865. He sent it\r\nand accompanied it with a note in which he said:\r\n\r\n“‘I had intended to keep this paper, but if it will help the soldiers, I\r\ngive it to you.’\r\n\r\n“The paper was put up at auction and brought $3,000. The buyer afterward\r\nsold it again to friends of Mr. Lincoln at a greatly advanced price, and\r\nit was placed in the rooms of the Chicago Historical Society, where it\r\nwas burned in the great fire of 1871.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERY FELLOW FOR HIMSELF.\r\n\r\nAn elegantly dressed young Virginian assured Lincoln that he had done a\r\ngreat deal of hard manual labor in his time. Much amused at this solemn\r\ndeclaration, Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; you Virginians shed barrels of perspiration while standing off\r\nat a distance and superintending the work your slaves do for you. It is\r\ndifferent with us. Here it is every fellow for himself, or he doesn’t\r\nget there.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“BUTCHER-KNIFE BOYS” AT THE POLLS.\r\n\r\nWhen young Lincoln had fully demonstrated that he was the champion\r\nwrestler in the country surrounding New Salem, the men of “de gang” at\r\nClary’s Grove, whose leader “Abe” had downed, were his sworn political\r\nfriends and allies.\r\n\r\nTheir work at the polls was remarkably effective. When the “Butcherknife\r\nboys,” the “huge-pawed boys,” and the “half-horse-half-alligator men”\r\n declared for a candidate the latter was never defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO “SECOND COMING” FOR SPRINGFIELD.\r\n\r\nSoon after the opening of Congress in 1861, Mr. Shannon, from\r\nCalifornia, made the customary call at the White House. In the\r\nconversation that ensued, Mr Shannon said: “Mr. President, I met an old\r\nfriend of yours in California last summer, a Mr. Campbell, who had a\r\ngood deal to say of your Springfield life.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” returned Mr. Lincoln, “I am glad to hear of him. Campbell used\r\nto be a dry fellow in those days,” he continued. “For a time he was\r\nSecretary of State. One day during the legislative vacation, a meek,\r\ncadaverous-looking man, with a white neck-cloth, introduced himself to\r\nhim at his office, and, stating that he had been informed that Mr. C.\r\nhad the letting of the hall of representatives, he wished to secure\r\nit, if possible, for a course of lectures he desired to deliver in\r\nSpringfield.\r\n\r\n“‘May I ask,’ said the Secretary, ‘what is to be the subject of your\r\nlectures?’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly,’ was the reply, with a very solemn expression of\r\ncountenance. ‘The course I wish to deliver is on the Second Coming of\r\nour Lord.’\r\n\r\n“‘It is of no use,’ said C.; ‘if you will take my advice, you will not\r\nwaste your time in this city. It is my private opinion that, if the Lord\r\nhas been in Springfield once, He will never come the second time!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HE WON A FRIEND.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Moulton, of Chicago, a master in chancery and influential in\r\npublic affairs, looked upon the candidacy of Mr. Lincoln for President\r\nas something in the nature of a joke. He did not rate the Illinois man\r\nin the same class with the giants of the East. In fact he had expressed\r\nhimself as by no means friendly to the Lincoln cause.\r\n\r\nStill he had been a good friend to Lincoln and had often met him when\r\nthe Springfield lawyer came to Chicago. Mr. Lincoln heard of Moulton’s\r\nattitude, but did not see Moulton until after the election, when the\r\nPresident-elect came to Chicago and was tendered a reception at one of\r\nthe big hotels.\r\n\r\nMoulton went up in the line to pay his respects to the newly-elected\r\nchief magistrate, purely as a formality, he explained to his companions.\r\nAs Moulton came along the line Mr. Lincoln grasped Moulton’s hand with\r\nhis right, and with his left took the master of chancery by the shoulder\r\nand pulled him out of the line.\r\n\r\n“You don’t belong in that line, Moulton,” said Mr. Lincoln. “You belong\r\nhere by me.”\r\n\r\nEveryone at the reception was a witness to the honoring of Moulton. From\r\nthat hour every faculty that Moulton possessed was at the service of the\r\nPresident. A little act of kindness, skillfully bestowed, had won him;\r\nand he stayed on to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEVER SUED A CLIENT.\r\n\r\nIf a client did not pay, Lincoln did not believe in suing for the fee.\r\nWhen a fee was paid him his custom was to divide the money into two\r\nequal parts, put one part into his pocket, and the other into an\r\nenvelope labeled “Herndon’s share.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINCOLN HOUSEHOLD GOODS.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that when “Abe” was born, the household goods of his\r\nfather consisted of a few cooking utensils, a little bedding, some\r\ncarpenter tools, and four hundred gallons of the fierce product of the\r\nmountain still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNNING THE MACHINE.\r\n\r\nOne of the cartoon-posters issued by the Democratic National Campaign\r\nCommittee in the fall of 1864 is given here. It had the legend, “Running\r\nthe Machine,” printed beneath; the “machine” was Secretary Chase’s\r\n“Greenback Mill,” and the mill was turning out paper money by the\r\nmillion to satisfy the demands of greedy contractors. “Uncle Abe” is\r\npictured as about to tell one of his funny stories, of which the scene\r\n“reminds” him; Secretary of War Stanton is receiving a message from the\r\nfront, describing a great victory, in which one prisoner and one gun\r\nwere taken; Secretary of State Seward is handing an order to a messenger\r\nfor the arrest of a man who had called him a “humbug,” the habeas corpus\r\nbeing suspended throughout the Union at that period; Secretary of\r\nthe Navy Welles--the long-haired, long-bearded man at the head of\r\nthe table--is figuring out a naval problem; at the side of the table,\r\nopposite “Uncle Abe,” are seated two Government contractors, shouting\r\nfor “more greenbacks,” and at the extreme left is Secretary of the\r\nTreasury Fessenden (who succeeded Chase when the latter was made Chief\r\nJustice of the United States Supreme Court), who complains that he\r\ncannot satisfy the greed of the contractors for “more greenbacks,”\r\n although he is grinding away at the mill day and night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS “BOSS” WHEN NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nLincoln was the actual head of the administration, and whenever he chose\r\nto do so he controlled Secretary of War Stanton as well as the other\r\nCabinet ministers.\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton on one occasion said: “Now, Mr. President, those are\r\nthe facts and you must see that your order cannot be executed.”\r\n\r\nLincoln replied in a somewhat positive tone: “Mr. Secretary, I reckon\r\nyou’ll have to execute the order.”\r\n\r\nStanton replied with vigor: “Mr. President, I cannot do it. This order\r\nis an improper one, and I cannot execute it.”\r\n\r\nLincoln fixed his eyes upon Stanton, and, in a firm voice and accent\r\nthat clearly showed his determination, said: “Mr. Secretary, it will\r\nhave to be done.”\r\n\r\nIt was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“RATHER STARVE THAN SWINDLE.”\r\n\r\nWard Lamon, once Lincoln’s law partner, relates a story which places\r\nLincoln’s high sense of honor in a prominent light. In a certain case,\r\nLincoln and Lamon being retained by a gentleman named Scott, Lamon put\r\nthe fee at $250, and Scott agreed to pay it. Says Lamon:\r\n\r\n“Scott expected a contest, but, to his surprise, the case was tried\r\ninside of twenty minutes; our success was complete. Scott was satisfied,\r\nand cheerfully paid over the money to me inside the bar, Lincoln looking\r\non. Scott then went out, and Lincoln asked, ‘What did you charge that\r\nman?’\r\n\r\n“I told him $250. Said he: ‘Lamon, that is all wrong. The service was\r\nnot worth that sum. Give him back at least half of it.’\r\n\r\n“I protested that the fee was fixed in advance; that Scott was perfectly\r\nsatisfied, and had so expressed himself. ‘That may be,’ retorted\r\nLincoln, with a look of distress and of undisguised displeasure, ‘but I\r\nam not satisfied. This is positively wrong. Go, call him back and return\r\nhalf the money at least, or I will not receive one cent of it for my\r\nshare.’\r\n\r\n“I did go, and Scott was astonished when I handed back half the fee.\r\n\r\n“This conversation had attracted the attention of the lawyers and\r\nthe court. Judge David Davis, then on our circuit bench (afterwards\r\nAssociate Justice on the United States Supreme bench), called Lincoln to\r\nhim. The Judge never could whisper, but in this instance he probably\r\ndid his best. At all events, in attempting to whisper to Lincoln he\r\ntrumpeted his rebuke in about these words, and in rasping tones that\r\ncould be heard all over the court-room: ‘Lincoln, I have been watching\r\nyou and Lamon. You are impoverishing this bar by your picayune charges\r\nof fees, and the lawyers have reason to complain of you. You are now\r\nalmost as poor as Lazarus, and if you don’t make people pay you more for\r\nyour services you will die as poor as Job’s turkey!’\r\n\r\n“Judge O. L. Davis, the leading lawyer in that part of the State,\r\npromptly applauded this malediction from the bench; but Lincoln was\r\nimmovable.\r\n\r\n“‘That money,’ said he, ‘comes out of the pocket of a poor, demented\r\ngirl, and I would rather starve than swindle her in this manner.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDON’T AIM TOO HIGH.\r\n\r\n“Billy, don’t shoot too high--aim lower, and the common people will\r\nunderstand you,” Lincoln once said to a brother lawyer.\r\n\r\n“They are the ones you want to reach--at least, they are the ones you\r\nought to reach.\r\n\r\n“The educated and refined people will understand you, anyway. If you aim\r\ntoo high, your idea will go over the heads of the masses, and only hit\r\nthose who need no hitting.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT MUCH AT RAIL-SPLITTING.\r\n\r\nOne who afterward became one of Lincoln’s most devoted friends and\r\nadherents tells this story regarding the manner in which Lincoln\r\nreceived him when they met for the first time:\r\n\r\n“After a comical survey of my fashionable toggery,--my swallow-tail\r\ncoat, white neck-cloth, and ruffled shirt (an astonishing outfit for a\r\nyoung limb of the law in that settlement), Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n“‘Going to try your hand at the law, are you? I should know at a glance\r\nthat you were a Virginian; but I don’t think you would succeed at\r\nsplitting rails. That was my occupation at your age, and I don’t think I\r\nhave taken as much pleasure in anything else from that day to this.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAVE THE SOLDIER THE PREFERENCE.\r\n\r\nJuly 27th, 1863, Lincoln wrote the Postmaster-General:\r\n\r\n“Yesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in two cases of\r\npostmasterships, sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the\r\nbattles of this war.\r\n\r\n“These cases, occurring on the same day, brought me to reflect more\r\nattentively than what I had before done as to what is fairly due from\r\nus here in dispensing of patronage toward the men who, by fighting our\r\nbattles, bear the chief burden of saving our country.\r\n\r\n“My conclusion is that, other claims and qualifications being equal,\r\nthey have the right, and this is especially applicable to the disabled\r\nsoldier and the deceased soldier’s family.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT WAS NOT SCARED.\r\n\r\nWhen told how uneasy all had been at his going to Richmond, Lincoln\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“Why, if any one else had been President and had gone to Richmond, I\r\nwould have been alarmed; but I was not scared about myself a bit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFF. DAVIS’ REPLY TO LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July, 1864, Horace Greeley crossed into Canada to confer\r\nwith refugee rebels at Niagara. He bore with him this paper from the\r\nPresident:\r\n\r\n“To Whom It May Concern: Any proposition which embraces the restoration\r\nof peace, the integrity of the whole Union, and the abandonment of\r\nslavery, and which comes by and with an authority that can control\r\nthe armies now at war with the United States, will be received and\r\nconsidered by the executive government of the United States, and will\r\nbe met by liberal terms and other substantial and collateral points, and\r\nthe bearer or bearers thereof shall have safe conduct both ways.”\r\n\r\nTo this Jefferson Davis replied: “We are not fighting for slavery; we\r\nare fighting for independence.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN WAS a GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\nLincoln was compelled to contend with the results of the ill-judged zeal\r\nof politicians, who forced ahead his flatboat and rail-splitting record,\r\nwith the homely surroundings of his earlier days, and thus, obscured\r\nfor the time, the other fact that, always having the heart, he had long\r\nsince acquired the manners of a true gentleman.\r\n\r\nSo, too, did he suffer from Eastern censors, who did not take those\r\nsurroundings into account, and allowed nothing for his originality of\r\ncharacter. One of these critics heard at Washington that Mr. Lincoln, in\r\nspeaking at different times of some move or thing, said “it had petered\r\nout;” that some other one’s plan “wouldn’t gibe;” and being asked if the\r\nWar and the cause of the Union were not a great care to him, replied:\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is a heavy hog to hold.”\r\n\r\nThe first two phrases are so familiar here in the West that they need no\r\nexplanation. Of the last and more pioneer one it may be said that it had\r\na special force, and was peculiarly Lincoln-like in the way applied by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the early times in Illinois, those having hogs, did their own\r\nkilling, assisted by their neighbors. Stripped of its hair, one held the\r\ncarcass nearly perpendicular in the air, head down, while others put\r\none point of the gambrel-bar through a slit in its hock, then over the\r\nstring-pole, and the other point through the other hock, and so swung\r\nthe animal clear of the ground. While all this was being done, it took a\r\ngood man to “hold the hog,” greasy, warmly moist, and weighing some two\r\nhundred pounds. And often those with the gambrel prolonged the strain,\r\nbeing provokingly slow, in hopes to make the holder drop his burden.\r\n\r\nThis latter thought is again expressed where President Lincoln, writing\r\nof the peace which he hoped would “come soon, to stay; and so come as to\r\nbe worth the keeping in all future time,” added that while there would\r\n“be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue and clenched\r\nteeth and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind\r\non to this great consummation,” he feared there would “be some white\r\nones unable to forget that, with malignant heart and deceitful tongue,\r\nthey had striven to hinder it.”\r\n\r\nHe had two seemingly opposite elements little understood by strangers,\r\nand which those in more intimate relations with him find difficult to\r\nexplain; an open, boyish tongue when in a happy mood, and with this a\r\nreserve of power, a force of thought that impressed itself without words\r\non observers in his presence. With the cares of the nation on his mind,\r\nhe became more meditative, and lost much of his lively ways remembered\r\n“back in Illinois.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS POOR RELATIONS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful traits of Mr. Lincoln’s character was his\r\nconsiderate regard for the poor and obscure relatives he had left,\r\nplodding along in their humble ways of life. Wherever upon his circuit\r\nhe found them, he always went to their dwellings, ate with them, and,\r\nwhen convenient, made their houses his home. He never assumed in their\r\npresence the slightest superiority to them. He gave them money when\r\nthey needed it and he had it. Countless times he was known to leave\r\nhis companions at the village hotel, after a hard day’s work in the\r\ncourt-room, and spend the evening with these old friends and companions\r\nof his humbler days. On one occasion, when urged not to go, he replied,\r\n“Why, Aunt’s heart would be broken if I should leave town without\r\ncalling upon her;” yet, he was obliged to walk several miles to make the\r\ncall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERTER’S SINS WASHED OUT IN BLOOD.\r\n\r\nThis was the reply made by Lincoln to an application for the pardon of\r\na soldier who had shown himself brave in war, had been severely wounded,\r\nbut afterward deserted:\r\n\r\n“Did you say he was once badly wounded?\r\n\r\n“Then, as the Scriptures say that in the shedding of blood is the\r\nremission of sins, I guess we’ll have to let him off this time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURE CURE FOR BOILS.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln and Postmaster-General Blair were talking of the war.\r\n\r\n“Blair,” said the President, “did you ever know that fright has\r\nsometimes proven a cure for boils?” “No, Mr. President, how is that?”\r\n “I’ll tell you. Not long ago when a colonel, with his cavalry, was at\r\nthe front, and the Rebs were making things rather lively for us, the\r\ncolonel was ordered out to a reconnaissance. He was troubled at the time\r\nwith a big boil where it made horseback riding decidedly uncomfortable.\r\nHe finally dismounted and ordered the troops forward without him. Soon\r\nhe was startled by the rapid reports of pistols and the helter-skelter\r\napproach of his troops in full retreat before a yelling rebel force.\r\nHe forgot everything but the yells, sprang into his saddle, and made\r\ncapital time over the fences and ditches till safe within the lines. The\r\npain from his boil was gone, and the boil, too, and the colonel swore\r\nthat there was no cure for boils so sure as fright from rebel yells.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAY FOR EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\nWhen President Lincoln issued a military order, it was usually\r\nexpressive, as the following shows:\r\n\r\n“War Department, Washington, July 22, ‘62.\r\n\r\n“First: Ordered that military commanders within the States of Virginia,\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas\r\nand Arkansas, in an orderly manner, seize and use any property, real\r\nor personal, which may be necessary or convenient for their several\r\ncommands, for supplies, or for other military purposes; and that while\r\nproperty may be all stored for proper military objects, none shall be\r\ndestroyed in wantonness or malice.\r\n\r\n“Second: That military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers\r\nwithin and from said States, so many persons of African descent as\r\ncan be advantageously used for military or naval purposes, giving them\r\nreasonable wages for their labor.\r\n\r\n“Third: That as to both property and persons of African descent,\r\naccounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show\r\nquantities and amounts, and from whom both property and such persons\r\nshall have come, as a basis upon which compensation can be made in\r\nproper cases; and the several departments of this Government shall\r\nattend to and perform their appropriate parts towards the execution of\r\nthese orders.\r\n\r\n“By order of the President.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBASHFUL WITH LADIES.\r\n\r\nJudge David Davis, Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and\r\nUnited States Senator from Illinois, was one of Lincoln’s most intimate\r\nfriends. He told this story on “Abe”:\r\n\r\n“Lincoln was very bashful when in the presence of ladies. I remember\r\nonce we were invited to take tea at a friend’s house, and while in the\r\nparlor I was called to the front gate to see someone.\r\n\r\n“When I returned, Lincoln, who had undertaken to entertain the ladies,\r\nwas twisting and squirming in his chair, and as bashful as a schoolboy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAW HUMOR IN EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\nThere was much that was irritating and uncomfortable in the\r\ncircuit-riding of the Illinois court, but there was more which was\r\namusing to a temperament like Lincoln’s. The freedom, the long days in\r\nthe open air, the unexpected if trivial adventures, the meeting with\r\nwayfarers and settlers--all was an entertainment to him. He found humor\r\nand human interest on the route where his companions saw nothing but\r\ncommonplaces.\r\n\r\n“He saw the ludicrous in an assemblage of fowls,” says H. C. Whitney,\r\none of his fellow-itinerants, “in a man spading his garden, in a\r\nclothes-line full of clothes, in a group of boys, in a lot of pigs\r\nrooting at a mill door, in a mother duck teaching her brood to swim--in\r\neverything and anything.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC FOR FOREIGN “RASH.”\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter part of 1863 that Russia offered its friendship to\r\nthe United States, and sent a strong fleet of warships, together with\r\nmunitions of war, to this country to be used in any way the President\r\nmight see fit. Russia was not friendly to England and France, these\r\nnations having defeated her in the Crimea a few years before. As Great\r\nBritain and the Emperor of the French were continually bothering him,\r\nPresident Lincoln used Russia’s kindly feeling and action as a means\r\nof keeping the other two powers named in a neutral state of mind.\r\nUnderneath the cartoon we here reproduce, which was labeled “Drawing\r\nThings to a Head,” and appeared in the issue of “Harper’s Weekly,” of\r\nNovember 28, 1863, was this DR. LINCOLN (to smart boy of the shop):\r\n“Mild applications of Russian Salve for our friends over the way, and\r\nheavy doses--and plenty of it for our Southern patient!!”\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Seward was the “smart boy” of the shop, and “our\r\nfriend over the way” were England and France. The latter bothered\r\nPresident Lincoln no more, but it is a fact that the Confederate\r\nprivateer Alabama was manned almost entirely by British seamen; also,\r\nthat when the Alabama was sunk by the Kearsarge, in the summer of 1864,\r\nthe Confederate seamen were picked up by an English vessel, taken to\r\nSouthhampton, and set at liberty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAVORED THE OTHER SIDE.\r\n\r\nLincoln was candor itself when conducting his side of a case in court.\r\nGeneral Mason Brayman tells this story as an illustration:\r\n\r\n“It is well understood by the profession that lawyers do not read\r\nauthors favoring the opposite side. I once heard Mr. Lincoln, in the\r\nSupreme Court of Illinois, reading from a reported case some strong\r\npoints in favor of his argument. Reading a little too far, and before\r\nbecoming aware of it, plunged into an authority against himself.\r\n\r\n“Pausing a moment, he drew up his shoulders in a comical way, and half\r\nlaughing, went on, ‘There, there, may it please the court, I reckon\r\nI’ve scratched up a snake. But, as I’m in for it, I guess I’ll read it\r\nthrough.’\r\n\r\n“Then, in his most ingenious and matchless manner, he went on with his\r\nargument, and won his case, convincing the court that it was not much of\r\na snake after all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND THE “SHOW”\r\n\r\nLincoln was fond of going all by himself to any little show or concert.\r\nHe would often slip away from his fellow-lawyers and spend the entire\r\nevening at a little magic lantern show intended for children.\r\n\r\nA traveling concert company was always sure of drawing Lincoln. A Mrs.\r\nHillis, a member of the “Newhall Family,” and a good singer, was the\r\nonly woman who ever seemed to exhibit any liking for him--so Lincoln\r\nsaid. He attended a negro-minstrel show in Chicago, once, where he heard\r\nDixie sung. It was entirely new, and pleased him greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MIXING” AND “MINGLING.”\r\n\r\nAn Eastern newspaper writer told how Lincoln, after his first\r\nnomination, received callers, the majority of them at his law office:\r\n\r\n“While talking to two or three gentlemen and standing up, a very hard\r\nlooking customer rolled in and tumbled into the only vacant chair and\r\nthe one lately occupied by Mr. Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln’s keen eye took in\r\nthe fact, but gave no evidence of the notice.\r\n\r\n“Turning around at last he spoke to the odd specimen, holding out his\r\nhand at such a distance that our friend had to vacate the chair if he\r\naccepted the proffered shake. Mr. Lincoln quietly resumed his chair.\r\n\r\n“It was a small matter, yet one giving proof more positively than a\r\nlarger event of that peculiar way the man has of mingling with a mixed\r\ncrowd.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOK PART OF THE BLAME.\r\n\r\nAmong the lawyers who traveled the circuit with Lincoln was Usher F.\r\nLinder, whose daughter, Rose Linder Wilkinson, has left many Lincoln\r\nreminiscences.\r\n\r\n“One case in which Mr. Lincoln was interested concerned a member of my\r\nown family,” said Mrs. Wilkinson. “My brother, Dan, in the heat of a\r\nquarrel, shot a young man named Ben Boyle and was arrested. My father\r\nwas seriously ill with inflammatory rheumatism at the time, and could\r\nscarcely move hand or foot. He certainly could not defend Dan. I was his\r\nsecretary, and I remember it was but a day or so after the shooting till\r\nletters of sympathy began to pour in. In the first bundle which I picked\r\nup there was a big letter, the handwriting on which I recognized as that\r\nof Mr. Lincoln. The letter was very sympathetic.\r\n\r\n“‘I know how you feel, Linder,’ it said. ‘I can understand your anger\r\nas a father, added to all the other sentiments. But may we not be in a\r\nmeasure to blame? We have talked about the defense of criminals before\r\nour children; about our success in defending them; have left the\r\nimpression that the greater the crime, the greater the triumph of\r\nsecuring an acquittal. Dan knows your success as a criminal lawyer,\r\nand he depends on you, little knowing that of all cases you would be of\r\nleast value in this.’\r\n\r\n“He concluded by offering his services, an offer which touched my father\r\nto tears.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln tried to have Dan released on bail, but Ben Boyle’s family\r\nand friends declared the wounded man would die, and feeling had grown so\r\nbitter that the judge would not grant any bail. So the case was changed\r\nto Marshall county, but as Ben finally recovered it was dismissed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT OF LEARNING A TRADE.\r\n\r\nLincoln at one time thought seriously of learning the blacksmith’s\r\ntrade. He was without means, and felt the immediate necessity of\r\nundertaking some business that would give him bread. While entertaining\r\nthis project an event occurred which, in his undetermined state of mind,\r\nseemed to open a way to success in another quarter.\r\n\r\nReuben Radford, keeper of a small store in the village of New Salem, had\r\nincurred the displeasure of the “Clary Grove Boys,” who exercised their\r\n“regulating” prerogatives by irregularly breaking his windows. William\r\nG. Greene, a friend of young Lincoln, riding by Radford’s store soon\r\nafterward, was hailed by him, and told that he intended to sell out.\r\nMr. Greene went into the store, and offered him at random $400 for his\r\nstock, which offer was immediately accepted.\r\n\r\nLincoln “happened in” the next day, and being familiar with the value of\r\nthe goods, Mr. Greene proposed to him to take an inventory of the stock,\r\nto see what sort of a bargain he had made. This he did, and it was found\r\nthat the goods were worth $600.\r\n\r\nLincoln then made an offer of $125 for his bargain, with the proposition\r\nthat he and a man named Berry, as his partner, take over Greene’s notes\r\ngiven to Radford. Mr. Greene agreed to the arrangement, but Radford\r\ndeclined it, except on condition that Greene would be their security.\r\nGreene at last assented.\r\n\r\nLincoln was not afraid of the “Clary Grove Boys”; on the contrary,\r\nthey had been his most ardent friends since the time he thrashed “Jack”\r\n Armstrong, champion bully of “The Grove”--but their custom was not\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\nThe business soon became a wreck; Greene had to not only assist in\r\nclosing it up, but pay Radford’s notes as well. Lincoln afterwards spoke\r\nof these notes, which he finally made good to Greene, as “the National\r\nDebt.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN DEFENDS FIFTEEN MRS. NATIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln’s sympathies were enlisted in any cause, he worked like a\r\ngiant to win. At one time (about 1855) he was in attendance upon court\r\nat the little town of Clinton, Ill., and one of the cases on the docket\r\nwas where fifteen women from a neighboring village were defendants, they\r\nhaving been indicted for trespass. Their offense, as duly set forth in\r\nthe indictment, was that of swooping down upon one Tanner, the keeper\r\nof a saloon in the village, and knocking in the heads of his barrels.\r\nLincoln was not employed in the case, but sat watching the trial as it\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\nIn defending the ladies, their attorney seemed to evince a little want\r\nof tact, and this prompted one of the former to invite Mr. Lincoln to\r\nadd a few words to the jury, if he thought he could aid their cause. He\r\nwas too gallant to refuse, and their attorney having consented, he made\r\nuse of the following argument:\r\n\r\n“In this case I would change the order of indictment and have it read\r\nThe State vs. Mr. Whiskey, instead of The State vs. The Ladies; and\r\ntouching these there are three laws: the law of self-protection; the law\r\nof the land, or statute law; and the moral law, or law of God.\r\n\r\n“First the law of self-protection is a law of necessity, as evinced by\r\nour forefathers in casting the tea overboard and asserting their right\r\nto the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness: In this case it is the\r\nonly defense the Ladies have, for Tanner neither feared God nor regarded\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“Second, the law of the land, or statute law, and Tanner is recreant to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n“Third, the moral law, or law of God, and this is probably a law for the\r\nviolation of which the jury can fix no punishment.”\r\n\r\nLincoln gave some of his own observations on the ruinous effects of\r\nwhiskey in society, and demanded its early suppression.\r\n\r\nAfter he had concluded, the Court, without awaiting the return of the\r\njury, dismissed the ladies, saying:\r\n\r\n“Ladies, go home. I will require no bond of you, and if any fine is ever\r\nwanted of you, we will let you know.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAVOIDED EVEN APPEARANCE OF EVIL\r\n\r\nFrank W. Tracy, President of the First National Bank of Springfield,\r\ntells a story illustrative of two traits in Mr. Lincoln’s character.\r\nShortly after the National banking law went into effect the First\r\nNational of Springield was chartered, and Mr. Tracy wrote to Mr.\r\nLincoln, with whom he was well acquainted in a business way, and\r\ntendered him an opportunity to subscribe for some of the stock.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the kindly offer Mr. Lincoln wrote, thanking Mr. Tracy,\r\nbut at the same time declining to subscribe. He said he recognized that\r\nstock in a good National bank would be a good thing to hold, but he did\r\nnot feel that he ought, as President, profit from a law which had been\r\npassed under his administration.\r\n\r\n“He seemed to wish to avoid even the appearance of evil,” said Mr.\r\nTracy, in telling of the incident. “And so the act proved both his\r\nunvarying probity and his unfailing policy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DIDN’T ADMIT OF HOLIDAYS.\r\n\r\nLincoln wrote a letter on October 2d, 1862, in which he observed:\r\n\r\n“I sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is,\r\nbut it does not admit of holidays.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“NEUTRALITY.”\r\n\r\nOld John Bull got himself into a precious fine scrape when he went so\r\nfar as to “play double” with the North, as well as the South, during the\r\ngreat American Civil War. In its issue of November 14th, 1863, London\r\n“Punch” printed a rather clever cartoon illustrating the predicament\r\nBull had created for himself. John is being lectured by Mrs. North and\r\nMrs. South--both good talkers and eminently able to hold their own\r\nin either social conversation, parliamentary debate or political\r\nargument--but he bears it with the best grace possible. This is the way\r\nthe text underneath the picture runs:\r\n\r\nMRS. NORTH. “How about the Alabama, you wicked old man?” MRS. SOUTH:\r\n“Where’s my rams? Take back your precious consols--there!!” “Punch” had\r\na good deal of fun with old John before it was through with him, but,\r\nas the Confederate privateer Alabama was sent beneath the waves of the\r\nocean at Cherbourg by the Kearsarge, and Mrs. South had no need for any\r\nmore rams, John got out of the difficulty without personal injury. It\r\nwas a tight squeeze, though, for Mrs. North was in a fighting humor, and\r\nprepared to scratch or pull hair. The fact that the privateer Alabama,\r\nbuilt at an English shipyard and manned almost entirely by English\r\nsailors, had managed to do about $10,000,000 worth of damage to United\r\nStates commerce, was enough to make any one angry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAYS OF GLADNESS PAST.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was well on, a patriot woman of the West urged President\r\nLincoln to make hospitals at the North where the sick from the Army of\r\nthe Mississippi could revive in a more bracing air. Among other reasons,\r\nshe said, feelingly: “If you grant my petition, you will be glad as long\r\nas you live.”\r\n\r\nWith a look of sadness impossible to describe, the President said:\r\n\r\n“I shall never be glad any more.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOULDN’T TAKE THE MONEY.\r\n\r\nLincoln always regarded himself as the friend and protector of\r\nunfortunate clients, and such he would never press for pay for his\r\nservices. A client named Cogdal was unfortunate in business, and gave a\r\nnote in settlement of legal fees. Soon afterward he met with an accident\r\nby which he lost a hand. Meeting Lincoln some time after on the steps of\r\nthe State-House, the kind lawyer asked him how he was getting along.\r\n\r\n“Badly enough,” replied Cogdal; “I am both broken up in business and\r\ncrippled.” Then he added, “I have been thinking about that note of\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nLincoln, who had probably known all about Cogdal’s troubles, and had\r\nprepared himself for the meeting, took out his pocket-book, and saying,\r\nwith a laugh, “Well, you needn’t think any more about it,” handed him\r\nthe note.\r\n\r\nCogdal protesting, Lincoln said, “Even if you had the money, I would not\r\ntake it,” and hurried away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT HELD ON ALL THE TIME.\r\n\r\n(Dispatch to General Grant, August 17th, 1864.)\r\n\r\n“I have seen your dispatch expressing your unwillingness to break your\r\nhold where you are. Neither am I willing.\r\n\r\n“Hold on with a bulldog grip.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEWED THE CUD IN SOLITUDE.\r\n\r\nAs a student (if such a term could be applied to Lincoln), one who did\r\nnot know him might have called him indolent. He would pick up a book and\r\nrun rapidly over the pages, pausing here and there.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour--never more than two or three hours--he would\r\nclose the book, stretch himself out on the office lounge, and then, with\r\nhands under his head and eyes shut, would digest the mental food he had\r\njust taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE’S” YANKEE INGENUITY.\r\n\r\nWar Governor Richard Yates (he was elected Governor of Illinois in\r\n1860, when Lincoln was first elected President) told a good story at\r\nSpringfield (Ill.) about Lincoln.\r\n\r\nOne day the latter was in the Sangamon River with his trousers rolled up\r\nfive feet--more or less--trying to pilot a flatboat over a mill-dam. The\r\nboat was so full of water that it was hard to manage. Lincoln got the\r\nprow over, and then, instead of waiting to bail the water out, bored\r\na hole through the projecting part and let it run out, affording a\r\nforcible illustration of the ready ingenuity of the future President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN PAID HOMAGE TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe Martyr President thus spoke of Washington in the course of an\r\naddress:\r\n\r\n“Washington is the mightiest name on earth--long since the mightiest in\r\nthe cause of civil liberty, still mightiest in moral reformation.\r\n\r\n“On that name a eulogy is expected. It cannot be.\r\n\r\n“To add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of Washington is\r\nalike impossible.\r\n\r\n“Let none attempt it.\r\n\r\n“In solemn awe pronounce the name, and, in its naked, deathless\r\nsplendor, leave it shining on.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIRRED EVEN THE REPORTERS.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s influence upon his audiences was wonderful. He could sway\r\npeople at will, and nothing better illustrates his extraordinary power\r\nthan he manner in which he stirred up the newspaper reporters by his\r\nBloomingon speech.\r\n\r\nJoseph Medill, editor of the Chicago Tribune, told the story:\r\n\r\n“It was my journalistic duty, though a delegate to the convention, to\r\nmake a ‘longhand’ report of the speeches delivered for the Tribune. I\r\ndid make a few paragraphs of what Lincoln said in the first eight or ten\r\nminutes, but I became so absorbed in his magnetic oratory that I forgot\r\nmyself and ceased to take notes, and joined with the convention in\r\ncheering and stamping and clapping to the end of his speech.\r\n\r\n“I well remember that after Lincoln sat down and calm had succeeded the\r\ntempest, I waked out of a sort of hypnotic trance, and then thought of\r\nmy report for the paper. There was nothing written but an abbreviated\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\n“It was some sort of satisfaction to find that I had not been ‘scooped,’\r\nas all the newspaper men present had been equally carried away by the\r\nexcitement caused by the wonderful oration and had made no report or\r\nsketch of the speech.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN “ABE” CAME IN.\r\n\r\nWhen “Abe” was fourteen years of age, John Hanks journeyed from Kentucky\r\nto Indiana and lived with the Lincolns. He described “Abe’s” habits\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n“When Lincoln and I returned to the house from work, he would go to the\r\ncupboard, snatch a piece of corn-bread, take down a book, sit down on a\r\nchair, cock his legs up as high as his head, and read.\r\n\r\n“He and I worked barefooted, grubbed it, plowed, mowed, cradled\r\ntogether; plowed corn, gathered it, and shucked corn. ‘Abe’ read\r\nconstantly when he had an opportunity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETERNAL FIDELITY TO THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY.\r\n\r\nDuring the Harrison Presidential campaign of 1840, Lincoln said, in a\r\nspeech at Springfield, Illinois:\r\n\r\n“Many free countries have lost their liberty, and ours may lose hers;\r\nbut if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was last to\r\ndesert, but that I never deserted her.\r\n\r\n“I know that the great volcano at Washington, aroused and directed\r\nby the evil spirit that reigns there, is belching forth the lava of\r\npolitical corruption in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping\r\nwith frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land,\r\nbidding fair to leave unscathed no green spot or living thing.\r\n\r\n“I cannot deny that all may be swept away. Broken by it, I, too, may be;\r\nbow to it I never will.\r\n\r\n“The possibility that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us\r\nfrom the support of a cause which we believe to be just. It shall never\r\ndeter me.\r\n\r\n“If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those\r\ndimensions not wholly unworthy of its Almighty Architect, it is when I\r\ncontemplate the cause of my country, deserted by all the world beside,\r\nand I standing up boldly alone, and hurling defiance at her victorious\r\noppressors.\r\n\r\n“Here, without contemplating consequences, before heaven, and in the\r\nface of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to the just cause, as I deem\r\nit, of the land of my life, my liberty, and my love; and who that thinks\r\nwith me will not fearlessly adopt the oath that I take?\r\n\r\n“Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may succeed.\r\n\r\n“But if, after all, we shall fail, be it so; we have the proud\r\nconsolation of saying to our consciences, and to the departed shade of\r\nour country’s freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment, and,\r\nadorned of our hearts in disaster, in chains, in death, we never\r\nfaltered in defending.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE’S” “DEFALCATIONS.”\r\n\r\nLincoln could not rest for as instant under the consciousness that, even\r\nunwittingly, he had defrauded anybody. On one occasion, while clerking\r\nin Offutt’s store, at New Salem, he sold a woman a little bale of goods,\r\namounting, by the reckoning, to $2.20. He received the money, and the\r\nwoman went away.\r\n\r\nOn adding the items of the bill again to make himself sure of\r\ncorrectness, he found that he had taken six and a quarter cents too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nIt was night, and, closing and locking the store, he started out on\r\nfoot, a distance of two or three miles, for the house of his defrauded\r\ncustomer, and, delivering to her the sum whose possession had so much\r\ntroubled him, went home satisfied.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, just as he was closing the store for the night, a\r\nwoman entered and asked for half a pound of tea. The tea was weighed\r\nout and paid for, and the store was left for the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Lincoln, when about to begin the duties of the day,\r\ndiscovered a four-ounce weight on the scales. He saw at once that he\r\nhad made a mistake, and, shutting the store, he took a long walk before\r\nbreakfast to deliver the remainder of the tea.\r\n\r\nThese are very humble incidents, but they illustrate the man’s perfect\r\nconscientiousness--his sensitive honesty--better, perhaps, than they\r\nwould if they were of greater moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE WASN’T GUILELESS.\r\n\r\nLeonard Swett, of Chicago, whose counsels were doubtless among the most\r\nwelcome to Lincoln, in summing up Lincoln’s character, said:\r\n\r\n“From the commencement of his life to its close I have sometimes doubted\r\nwhether he ever asked anybody’s advice about anything. He would listen\r\nto everybody; he would hear everybody; but he rarely, if ever, asked for\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n“As a politician and as President he arrived at all his conclusions from\r\nhis own reflections, and when his conclusions were once formed he never\r\ndoubted but what they were right.\r\n\r\n“One great public mistake of his (Lincoln’s) character, as generally\r\nreceived and acquiesced in, is that he is considered by the people of\r\nthis country as a frank, guileless, and unsophisticated man. There never\r\nwas a greater mistake.\r\n\r\n“Beneath a smooth surface of candor and apparent declaration of all\r\nhis thoughts and feelings he exercised the most exalted tact and wisest\r\ndiscrimination. He handled and moved men remotely as we do pieces upon a\r\nchess-board.\r\n\r\n“He retained through life all the friends he ever had, and he made the\r\nwrath of his enemies to praise him. This was not by cunning or intrigue\r\nin the low acceptation of the term, but by far-seeing reason and\r\ndiscernment. He always told only enough of his plans and purposes to\r\ninduce the belief that he had communicated all; yet he reserved enough\r\nto have communicated nothing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET, BUT MILD REVENGE.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States found that a war with Black Hawk could not be\r\ndodged, Governor Reynolds, of Illinois, issued a call for volunteers,\r\nand among the companies that immediately responded was one from Menard\r\ncounty, Illinois. Many of these volunteers were from New Salem and\r\nClary’s Grove, and Lincoln, being out of business, was the first to\r\nenlist.\r\n\r\nThe company being full, the men held a meeting at Richland for the\r\nelection of officers. Lincoln had won many hearts, and they told him\r\nthat he must be their captain. It was an office to which he did not\r\naspire, and for which he felt he had no special fitness; but he finally\r\nconsented to be a candidate.\r\n\r\nThere was but one other candidate, a Mr. Kirkpatrick, who was one of the\r\nmost influential men of the region. Previously, Kirkpatrick had been\r\nan employer of Lincoln, and was so overbearing in his treatment of the\r\nyoung man that the latter left him.\r\n\r\nThe simple mode of electing a captain adopted by the company was by\r\nplacing the candidates apart, and telling the men to go and stand with\r\nthe one they preferred. Lincoln and his competitor took their positions,\r\nand then the word was given. At least three out of every four went to\r\nLincoln at once.\r\n\r\nWhen it was seen by those who had arranged themselves with the other\r\ncandidate that Lincoln was the choice of the majority of the company,\r\nthey left their places, one by one, and came over to the successful\r\nside, until Lincoln’s opponent in the friendly strife was left standing\r\nalmost alone.\r\n\r\n“I felt badly to see him cut so,” says a witness of the scene.\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity for revenge. The humble laborer was his\r\nemployer’s captain, but the opportunity was never improved. Mr. Lincoln\r\nfrequently confessed that no subsequent success of his life had given\r\nhim half the satisfaction that this election did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDN’T TRUST THE COURT.\r\n\r\nIn one of his many stories of Lincoln, his law partner, W. H. Herndon,\r\ntold this as illustrating Lincoln’s shrewdness as a lawyer:\r\n\r\n“I was with Lincoln once and listened to an oral argument by him in\r\nwhich he rehearsed an extended history of the law. It was a carefully\r\nprepared and masterly discourse, but, as I thought, entirely useless.\r\nAfter he was through and we were walking home, I asked him why he went\r\nso far back in the history of the law. I presumed the court knew enough\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n“‘That’s where you’re mistaken,’ was his instant rejoinder. ‘I dared\r\nnot just the case on the presumption that the court knows everything--in\r\nfact I argued it on the presumption that the court didn’t know\r\nanything,’ a statement, which, when one reviews the decision of our\r\nappellate courts, is not so extravagant as one would at first suppose.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDSOMEST MAN ON EARTH.\r\n\r\nOne day Thaddeus Stevens called at the White House with an elderly\r\nwoman, whose son had been in the army, but for some offense had been\r\ncourt-martialed and sentenced to death. There were some extenuating\r\ncircumstances, and after a full hearing the President turned to Stevens\r\nand said: “Mr. Stevens, do you think this is a case which will warrant\r\nmy interference?”\r\n\r\n“With my knowledge of the facts and the parties,” was the reply, “I\r\nshould have no hesitation in granting a pardon.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” returned Mr. Lincoln, “I will pardon him,” and proceeded\r\nforthwith to execute the paper.\r\n\r\nThe gratitude of the mother was too deep for expression, save by her\r\ntears, and not a word was said between her and Stevens until they were\r\nhalf way down the stairs on their passage out, when she suddenly broke\r\nforth in an excited manner with the words:\r\n\r\n“I knew it was a copperhead lie!”\r\n\r\n“What do you refer to, madam?” asked Stevens.\r\n\r\n“Why, they told me he was an ugly-looking man,” she replied, with\r\nvehemence. “He is the handsomest man I ever saw in my life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT COON CAME DOWN.\r\n\r\n“Lincoln’s Last Warning” was the title of a cartoon which appeared in\r\n“Harper’s Weekly,” on October 11, 1862. Under the picture was the text:\r\n\r\n“Now if you don’t come down I’ll cut the tree from under you.”\r\n\r\nThis illustration was peculiarly apt, as, on the 1st of January, 1863,\r\nPresident Lincoln issued his great Emancipation Proclamation, declaring\r\nall slaves in the United States forever free. “Old Abe” was a handy\r\nman with the axe, he having split many thousands of rails with its keen\r\nedge. As the “Slavery Coon” wouldn’t heed the warning, Lincoln did cut\r\nthe tree from under him, and so he came down to the ground with a heavy\r\nthump.\r\n\r\nThis Act of Emancipation put an end to the notion of the Southern slave\r\nholders that involuntary servitude was one of the “sacred institutions”\r\n on the Continent of North America. It also demonstrated that Lincoln was\r\nthoroughly in earnest when he declared that he would not only save the\r\nUnion, but that he meant what he said in the speech wherein he asserted,\r\n“This Nation cannot exist half slave and half free.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWROTE “PIECES” WHEN VERY YOUNG.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen years of age “Abe” wrote “pieces,” or compositions, and even\r\nsome doggerel rhyme, which he recited, to the great amusement of his\r\nplaymates.\r\n\r\nOne of his first compositions was against cruelty to animals. He was\r\nvery much annoyed and pained at the conduct of the boys, who were in the\r\nhabit of catching terrapins and putting coals of fire on their backs,\r\nwhich thoroughly disgusted Abraham.\r\n\r\n“He would chide us,” said “Nat” Grigsby, “tell us it was wrong, and\r\nwould write against it.”\r\n\r\nWhen eighteen years old, “Abe” wrote a “piece” on “National Politics,”\r\n and it so pleased a lawyer friend, named Pritchard, that the latter\r\nhad it printed in an obscure paper, thereby adding much to the author’s\r\npride. “Abe” did not conceal his satisfaction. In this “piece” he wrote,\r\namong other things:\r\n\r\n“The American government is the best form of government for an\r\nintelligent people. It ought to be kept sound, and preserved forever,\r\nthat general education should be fostered and carried all over the\r\ncountry; that the Constitution should be saved, the Union perpetuated\r\nand the laws revered, respected and enforced.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“TRY TO STEER HER THROUGH.”\r\n\r\nJohn A. Logan and a friend of Illinois called upon Lincoln at Willard’s\r\nHotel, Washington, February 23d, the morning of his arrival, and urged a\r\nvigorous, firm policy.\r\n\r\nPatiently listening, Lincoln replied seriously but cheerfully:\r\n\r\n“As the country has placed me at the helm of the ship, I’ll try to steer\r\nher through.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND, GLOOMY AND PECULIAR.\r\n\r\nLincoln was a marked and peculiar young man. People talked about him.\r\nHis studious habits, his greed for information, his thorough mastery\r\nof the difficulties of every new position in which he was placed,\r\nhis intelligence on all matters of public concern, his unwearying\r\ngood-nature, his skill in telling a story, his great athletic power,\r\nhis quaint, odd ways, his uncouth appearance--all tended to bring him in\r\nsharp contrast with the dull mediocrity by which he was surrounded.\r\n\r\nDenton Offutt, his old employer, said, after having had a conversation\r\nwith Lincoln, that the young man “had talent enough in him to make a\r\nPresident.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE WAY TO GETTYSBURG.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln was on his way to the National Cemetery at Gettysburg, an\r\nold gentleman told him that his only son fell on Little Round Top at\r\nGettysburg, and he was going to look at the spot. Mr. Lincoln replied:\r\n“You have been called on to make a terrible sacrifice for the Union, and\r\na visit to that spot, I fear, will open your wounds afresh.\r\n\r\n“But, oh, my dear sir, if we had reached the end of such sacrifices,\r\nand had nothing left for us to do but to place garlands on the graves\r\nof those who have already fallen, we could give thanks even amidst our\r\ntears; but when I think of the sacrifices of life yet to be offered, and\r\nthe hearts and homes yet to be made desolate before this dreadful war is\r\nover, my heart is like lead within me, and I feel at times like hiding\r\nin deep darkness.” At one of the stopping places of the train, a very\r\nbeautiful child, having a bunch of rosebuds in her hand, was lifted up\r\nto an open window of the President’s car. “Floweth for the President.”\r\n The President stepped to the window, took the rosebuds, bent down and\r\nkissed the child, saying, “You are a sweet little rosebud yourself. I\r\nhope your life will open into perpetual beauty and goodness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOOD UP THE LONGEST.\r\n\r\nThere was a rough gallantry among the young people; and Lincoln’s old\r\ncomrades and friends in Indiana have left many tales of how he “went to\r\nsee the girls,” of how he brought in the biggest back-log and made the\r\nbrightest fire; of how the young people, sitting around it, watching the\r\nway the sparks flew, told their fortunes.\r\n\r\nHe helped pare apples, shell corn and crack nuts. He took the girls to\r\nmeeting and to spelling school, though he was not often allowed to take\r\npart in the spelling-match, for the one who “chose first” always chose\r\n“Abe” Lincoln, and that was equivalent to winning, as the others knew\r\nthat “he would stand up the longest.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MORTIFYING EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\nA lady reader or elocutionist came to Springfield in 1857. A large crowd\r\ngreeted her. Among other things she recited “Nothing to Wear,” a piece\r\nin which is described the perplexities that beset “Miss Flora McFlimsy”\r\n in her efforts to appear fashionable.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of one stanza in which no effort is made to say anything\r\nparticularly amusing, and during the reading of which the audience\r\nmanifested the most respectful silence and attention, some one in the\r\nrear seats burst out with a loud, coarse laugh, a sudden and explosive\r\nguffaw.\r\n\r\nIt startled the speaker and audience, and kindled a storm of\r\nunsuppressed laughter and applause. Everybody looked back to ascertain\r\nthe cause of the demonstration, and were greatly surprised to find that\r\nit was Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHe blushed and squirmed with the awkward diffidence of a schoolboy.\r\nWhat caused him to laugh, no one was able to explain. He was doubtless\r\nwrapped up in a brown study, and recalling some amusing episode,\r\nindulged in laughter without realizing his surroundings. The experience\r\nmortified him greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO HALFWAY BUSINESS.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Lincoln began to practice law at Springfield, he was\r\nengaged in a criminal case in which it was thought there was little\r\nchance of success. Throwing all his powers into it, he came off\r\nvictorious, and promptly received for his services five hundred dollars.\r\nA legal friend, calling upon him the next morning, found him sitting\r\nbefore a table, upon which his money was spread out, counting it over\r\nand over.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Judge,” said he. “See what a heap of money I’ve got from\r\nthis case. Did you ever see anything like it? Why, I never had so much\r\nmoney in my life before, put it all together.” Then, crossing his arms\r\nupon the table, his manner sobering down, he added: “I have got just\r\nfive hundred dollars; if it were only seven hundred and fifty, I would\r\ngo directly and purchase a quarter section of land, and settle it upon\r\nmy old step-mother.”\r\n\r\nHis friend said that if the deficiency was all he needed, he would loan\r\nhim the amount, taking his note, to which Mr. Lincoln instantly acceded.\r\n\r\nHis friend then said:\r\n\r\n“Lincoln, I would do just what you have indicated. Your step-mother is\r\ngetting old, and will not probably live many years. I would settle the\r\nproperty upon her for her use during her lifetime, to revert to you upon\r\nher death.”\r\n\r\nWith much feeling, Mr. Lincoln replied:\r\n\r\n“I shall do no such thing. It is a poor return at best for all the good\r\nwoman’s devotion and fidelity to me, and there is not going to be any\r\nhalfway business about it.” And so saying, he gathered up his money and\r\nproceeded forthwith to carry his long-cherished purpose into execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOURAGED LITIGATION.\r\n\r\nLincoln believed in preventing unnecessary litigation, and carried out\r\nthis in his practice. “Who was your guardian?” he asked a young man who\r\ncame to him to complain that a part of the property left him had been\r\nwithheld. “Enoch Kingsbury,” replied the young man.\r\n\r\n“I know Mr. Kingsbury,” said Lincoln, “and he is not the man to have\r\ncheated you out of a cent, and I can’t take the case, and advise you to\r\ndrop the subject.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOING HOME TO GET READY.\r\n\r\nEdwin M. Stanton was one of the attorneys in the great “reaper patent”\r\n case heard in Cincinnati in 1855, Lincoln also having been retained.\r\nThe latter was rather anxious to deliver the argument on the general\r\npropositions of law applicable to the case, but it being decided to have\r\nMr. Stanton do this, the Westerner made no complaint.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Stanton’s argument and the view Lincoln took of it, Ralph\r\nEmerson, a young lawyer who was present at the trial, said:\r\n\r\n“The final summing up on our side was by Mr. Stanton, and though he took\r\nbut about three hours in its delivery, he had devoted as many, if not\r\nmore, weeks to its preparation. It was very able, and Mr. Lincoln was\r\nthroughout the whole of it a rapt listener. Mr. Stanton closed his\r\nspeech in a flight of impassioned eloquence.\r\n\r\n“Then the court adjourned for the day, and Mr. Lincoln invited me to\r\ntake a long walk with him. For block after block he walked rapidly\r\nforward, not saying a word, evidently deeply dejected.\r\n\r\n“At last he turned suddenly to me, exclaiming, ‘Emerson, I am going\r\nhome.’ A pause. ‘I am going home to study law.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why,’ I exclaimed, ‘Mr. Lincoln, you stand at the head of the bar in\r\nIllinois now! What are you talking about?’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I do occupy a good position there, and I think\r\nthat I can get along with the way things are done there now. But these\r\ncollege-trained men, who have devoted their whole lives to study, are\r\ncoming West, don’t you see? And they study their cases as we never do.\r\nThey have got as far as Cincinnati now. They will soon be in Illinois.’\r\n\r\n“Another long pause; then stopping and turning toward me, his\r\ncountenance suddenly assuming that look of strong determination which\r\nthose who knew him best sometimes saw upon his face, he exclaimed, ‘I am\r\ngoing home to study law! I am as good as any, of them, and when they get\r\nout to Illinois, I will be ready for them.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE ‘RAIL-SPUTTER’ REPAIRING THE UNION.”\r\n\r\nThe cartoon given here in facsimile was one of the posters which\r\ndecorated the picturesque Presidential campaign of 1864, and assisted\r\nin making the period previous to the vote-casting a lively and memorable\r\none. This poster was a lithograph, and, as the title, “The Rail-Splitter\r\nat Work Repairing the Union,” would indicate, the President is using the\r\nVice-Presidential candidate on the Republican National ticket (Andrew\r\nJohnson) as an aid in the work. Johnson was, in early life, a tailor,\r\nand he is pictured as busily engaged in sewing up the rents made in the\r\nmap of the Union by the secessionists.\r\n\r\nBoth men are thoroughly in earnest, and, as history relates, the torn\r\nplaces in the Union map were stitched together so nicely that no one\r\ncould have told, by mere observation, that a tear had ever been made.\r\nAndrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln upon the assassination of the\r\nlatter, was a remarkable man. Born in North Carolina, he removed to\r\nTennessee when young, was Congressman, Governor, and United States\r\nSenator, being made military Governor of his State in 1862. A strong,\r\nstanch Union man, he was nominated for the Vice-Presidency on the\r\nLincoln ticket to conciliate the War Democrats. After serving out his\r\nterm as President, he was again elected United States Senator from\r\nTennessee, but died shortly after taking his seat. But he was just the\r\nsort of a man to assist “Uncle Abe” in sewing up the torn places in the\r\nUnion map, and as military Governor of Tennessee was a powerful factor\r\nin winning friends in the South to the Union cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“FIND OUT FOR YOURSELVES.”\r\n\r\n“Several of us lawyers,” remarked one of his colleagues, “in the eastern\r\nend of the circuit, annoyed Lincoln once while he was holding court for\r\nDavis by attempting to defend against a note to which there were many\r\nmakers. We had no legal, but a good moral defense, but what we wanted\r\nmost of all was to stave it off till the next term of court by one\r\nexpedient or another.\r\n\r\n“We bothered ‘the court’ about it till late on Saturday, the day of\r\nadjournment. He adjourned for supper with nothing left but this case to\r\ndispose of. After supper he heard our twaddle for nearly an hour, and\r\nthen made this odd entry.\r\n\r\n“‘L. D. Chaddon vs. J. D. Beasley et al. April Term, 1856. Champaign\r\ncounty Court. Plea in abatement by B. Z. Green, a defendant not served,\r\nfiled Saturday at 11 o’clock a. m., April 24, 1856, stricken from the\r\nfiles by order of court. Demurrer to declaration, if there ever was one,\r\noverruled. Defendants who are served now, at 8 o’clock p. m., of the\r\nlast day of the term, ask to plead to the merits, which is denied by the\r\ncourt on the ground that the offer comes too late, and therefore, as\r\nby nil dicet, judgment is rendered for Pl’ff. Clerk assess damages. A.\r\nLincoln, Judge pro tem.’\r\n\r\n“The lawyer who reads this singular entry will appreciate its oddity\r\nif no one else does. After making it, one of the lawyers, on recovering\r\nfrom his astonishment, ventured to enquire: ‘Well, Lincoln, how can we\r\nget this case up again?’\r\n\r\n“Lincoln eyed him quizzically for a moment, and then answered, ‘You have\r\nall been so mighty smart about this case, you can find out how to take\r\nit up again yourselves.”’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGH ON THE NEGRO.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, one day, was talking with the Rev. Dr. Sunderland about the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation and the future of the negro. Suddenly a ripple\r\nof amusement broke the solemn tone of his voice. “As for the negroes,\r\nDoctor, and what is going to become of them: I told Ben Wade the other\r\nday, that it made me think of a story I read in one of my first books,\r\n‘Aesop’s Fables.’ It was an old edition, and had curious rough wood\r\ncuts, one of which showed three white men scrubbing a negro in a potash\r\nkettle filled with cold water. The text explained that the men thought\r\nthat by scrubbing the negro they might make him white. Just about the\r\ntime they thought they were succeeding, he took cold and died. Now, I\r\nam afraid that by the time we get through this War the negro will catch\r\ncold and die.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALLENGED ALL COMERS.\r\n\r\nPersonal encounters were of frequent occurrence in Gentryville in early\r\ndays, and the prestige of having thrashed an opponent gave the victor\r\nmarked social distinction. Green B. Taylor, with whom “Abe” worked the\r\ngreater part of one winter on a farm, furnished an account of the noted\r\nfight between John Johnston, “Abe’s” stepbrother, and William Grigsby,\r\nin which stirring drama “Abe” himself played an important role before\r\nthe curtain was rung down.\r\n\r\nTaylor’s father was the second for Johnston, and William Whitten\r\nofficiated in a similar capacity for Grigsby. “They had a terrible\r\nfight,” related Taylor, “and it soon became apparent that Grigsby was\r\ntoo much for Lincoln’s man, Johnston. After they had fought a long time\r\nwithout interference, it having been agreed not to break the ring, ‘Abe’\r\nburst through, caught Grigsby, threw him off and some feet away. There\r\nGrigsby stood, proud as Lucifer, and, swinging a bottle of liquor over\r\nhis head, swore he was ‘the big buck of the lick.’\r\n\r\n“‘If any one doubts it,’ he shouted, ‘he has only to come on and whet\r\nhis horns.’”\r\n\r\nA general engagement followed this challenge, but at the end of\r\nhostilities the field was cleared and the wounded retired amid the\r\nexultant shouts of their victors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“GOVERNMENT RESTS IN PUBLIC OPINION.”\r\n\r\nLincoln delivered a speech at a Republican banquet at Chicago, December\r\n10th, 1856, just after the Presidential campaign of that year, in which\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n“Our government rests in public opinion. Whoever can change public\r\nopinion can change the government practically just so much.\r\n\r\n“Public opinion, on any subject, always has a ‘central idea,’ from which\r\nall its minor thoughts radiate.\r\n\r\n“That ‘central idea’ in our political public opinion at the beginning\r\nwas, and until recently has continued to be, ‘the equality of man.’\r\n\r\n“And although it has always submitted patiently to whatever of\r\ninequality there seemed to be as a matter of actual necessity, its\r\nconstant working has been a steady progress toward the practical\r\nequality of all men.\r\n\r\n“Let everyone who really believes, and is resolved, that free society is\r\nnot and shall not be a failure, and who can conscientiously declare that\r\nin the past contest he has done only what he thought best--let every\r\nsuch one have charity to believe that every other one can say as much.\r\n\r\n“Thus, let bygones be bygones; let party differences as nothing be,\r\nand with steady eye on the real issue, let us reinaugurate the good old\r\n‘central ideas’ of the Republic.\r\n\r\n“We can do it. The human heart is with us; God is with us.\r\n\r\n“We shall never be able to declare that ‘all States as States are\r\nequal,’ nor yet that ‘all citizens are equal,’ but to renew the broader,\r\nbetter declaration, including both these and much more, that ‘all men\r\nare created equal.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHURRY MIGHT MAKE TROUBLE.\r\n\r\nUp to the very last moment of the life of the Confederacy, the London\r\n“Punch” had its fling at the United States. In a cartoon, printed\r\nFebruary 18th, 1865, labeled “The Threatening Notice,” “Punch” intimates\r\nthat Uncle Sam is in somewhat of a hurry to serve notice on John Bull\r\nregarding the contentions in connection with the northern border of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nLincoln, however, as attorney for his revered Uncle, advises caution.\r\nAccordingly, he tells his Uncle, according to the text under the picture:\r\n\r\nATTORNEY LINCOLN: “Now, Uncle Sam, you’re in a darned hurry to serve\r\nthis here notice on John Bull. Now, it’s my duty, as your attorney, to\r\ntell you that you may drive him to go over to that cuss, Davis.” (Uncle\r\nSam considers.) In this instance, President Lincoln is given credit for\r\njudgment and common sense, his advice to his Uncle Sam to be prudent\r\nbeing sound. There was trouble all along the Canadian border during the\r\nWar, while Canada was the refuge of Northern conspirators and Southern\r\nspies, who, at times, crossed the line and inflicted great damage\r\nupon the States bordering on it. The plot to seize the great lake\r\ncities--Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo and others--was\r\nfigured out in Canada by the Southerners and Northern allies. President\r\nLincoln, in his message to Congress in December, 1864, said the United\r\nStates had given notice to England that, at the end of six months, this\r\ncountry would, if necessary, increase its naval armament upon the lakes.\r\nWhat Great Britain feared was the abrogation by the United States of all\r\ntreaties regarding Canada. By previous stipulation, the United States\r\nand England were each to have but one war vessel on the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAW HIMSELF DEAD.\r\n\r\nThis story cannot be repeated in Lincoln’s own language, although he\r\ntold it often enough to intimate friends; but, as it was never taken\r\ndown by a stenographer in the martyred President’s exact words, the\r\nreader must accept a simple narration of the strange occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after the first nomination of Lincoln for the\r\nPresidency, when he saw, or imagined he saw, the startling apparition.\r\nOne day, feeling weary, he threw himself upon a lounge in one of the\r\nrooms of his house at Springfield to rest. Opposite the lounge upon\r\nwhich he was lying was a large, long mirror, and he could easily see the\r\nreflection of his form, full length.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he saw, or imagined he saw, two Lincolns in the mirror, each\r\nlying full length upon the lounge, but they differed strangely in\r\nappearance. One was the natural Lincoln, full of life, vigor, energy and\r\nstrength; the other was a dead Lincoln, the face white as marble, the\r\nlimbs nerveless and lifeless, the body inert and still.\r\n\r\nLincoln was so impressed with this vision, which he considered merely\r\nan optical illusion, that he arose, put on his hat, and went out for\r\na walk. Returning to the house, he determined to test the matter\r\nagain--and the result was the same as before. He distinctly saw the two\r\nLincolns--one living and the other dead.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing to his wife about this, she being, at that time, in\r\na nervous condition, and apprehensive that some accident would surely\r\nbefall her husband. She was particularly fearful that he might be the\r\nvictim of an assassin. Lincoln always made light of her fears, but yet\r\nhe was never easy in his mind afterwards.\r\n\r\nTo more thoroughly test the so-called “optical illusion,” and prove,\r\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt, whether it was a mere fanciful creation of\r\nthe brain or a reflection upon the broad face of the mirror which might\r\nbe seen at any time, Lincoln made frequent experiments. Each and\r\nevery time the result was the same. He could not get away from the two\r\nLincolns--one living and the other dead.\r\n\r\nLincoln never saw this forbidding reflection while in the White House.\r\nTime after time he placed a couch in front of a mirror at a distance\r\nfrom the glass where he could view his entire length while lying down,\r\nbut the looking-glass in the Executive Mansion was faithful to its\r\ntrust, and only the living Lincoln was observable.\r\n\r\nThe late Ward Lamon, once a law partner of Lincoln, and Marshal of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia during his first administration, tells, in his\r\n“Recollections of Abraham Lincoln,” of the dreams the President had--all\r\nforetelling death.\r\n\r\nLamon was Lincoln’s most intimate friend, being, practically, his\r\nbodyguard, and slept in the White House. In reference to Lincoln’s\r\n“death dreams,” he says:\r\n\r\n“How, it may be asked, could he make life tolerable, burdened as he was\r\nwith that portentous horror, which, though visionary, and of trifling\r\nimport in our eyes, was by his interpretation a premonition of impending\r\ndoom? I answer in a word: His sense of duty to his country; his belief\r\nthat ‘the inevitable’ is right; and his innate and irrepressible humor.\r\n\r\n“But the most startling incident in the life of Mr. Lincoln was a dream\r\nhe had only a few days before his assassination. To him it was a thing\r\nof deadly import, and certainly no vision was ever fashioned more\r\nexactly like a dread reality. Coupled with other dreams, with the\r\nmirror-scene and with other incidents, there was something about it so\r\namazingly real, so true to the actual tragedy which occurred soon after,\r\nthat more than mortal strength and wisdom would have been required to\r\nlet it pass without a shudder or a pang.\r\n\r\n“After worrying over it for some days, Mr. Lincoln seemed no longer able\r\nto keep the secret. I give it as nearly in his own words as I can, from\r\nnotes which I made immediately after its recital. There were only two or\r\nthree persons present.\r\n\r\n“The President was in a melancholy, meditative mood, and had been silent\r\nfor some time. Mrs. Lincoln, who was present, rallied him on his solemn\r\nvisage and want of spirit. This seemed to arouse him, and, without\r\nseeming to notice her sally, he said, in slow and measured tones:\r\n\r\n“‘It seems strange how much there is in the Bible about dreams. There\r\nare, I think, some sixteen chapters in the Old Testament and four or\r\nfive in the New, in which dreams are mentioned; and there are many other\r\npassages scattered throughout the book which refer to visions. In\r\nthe old days, God and His angels came to men in their sleep and made\r\nthemselves known in dreams.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Lincoln here remarked, ‘Why, you look dreadfully solemn; do you\r\nbelieve in dreams?’\r\n\r\n“‘I can’t say that I do,’ returned Mr. Lincoln; ‘but I had one the other\r\nnight which has haunted me ever since. After it occurred the first\r\ntime, I opened the Bible, and, strange as it may appear, it was at the\r\ntwenty-eighth chapter of Genesis, which relates the wonderful dream\r\nJacob had. I turned to other passages, and seemed to encounter a dream\r\nor a vision wherever I looked. I kept on turning the leaves of the\r\nold book, and everywhere my eyes fell upon passages recording matters\r\nstrangely in keeping with my own thoughts--supernatural visitations,\r\ndreams, visions, etc.’\r\n\r\n“He now looked so serious and disturbed that Mrs. Lincoln exclaimed ‘You\r\nfrighten me! What is the matter?’\r\n\r\n“‘I am afraid,’ said Mr. Lincoln, observing the effect his words had\r\nupon his wife, ‘that I have done wrong to mention the subject at all;\r\nbut somehow the thing has got possession of me, and, like Banquo’s\r\nghost, it will not down.’\r\n\r\n“This only inflamed Mrs. Lincoln’s curiosity the more, and while bravely\r\ndisclaiming any belief in dreams, she strongly urged him to tell the\r\ndream which seemed to have such a hold upon him, being seconded in this\r\nby another listener. Mr. Lincoln hesitated, but at length commenced very\r\ndeliberately, his brow overcast with a shade of melancholy.\r\n\r\n“‘About ten days ago,’ said he, ‘I retired very late. I had been up\r\nwaiting for important dispatches from the front. I could not have been\r\nlong in bed when I fell into a slumber, for I was weary. I soon began to\r\ndream. There seemed to be a deathlike stillness about me. Then I heard\r\nsubdued sobs, as if a number of people were weeping.\r\n\r\n“‘I thought I left my bed and wandered down-stairs. There the silence\r\nwas broken by the same pitiful sobbing, but the mourners were invisible.\r\nI went from room to room; no living person was in sight, but the same\r\nmournful sounds of distress met me as I passed along. It was light in\r\nall the rooms; every object was familiar to me; but where were all the\r\npeople who were grieving as if their hearts would break? I was puzzled\r\nand alarmed. What could be the meaning of all this?\r\n\r\n“‘Determined to find the cause of a state of things so mysterious and so\r\nshocking, I kept on until I arrived at the East Room, which I entered.\r\nThere I met with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque,\r\non which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were\r\nstationed soldiers who were acting as guards; and there was a throng of\r\npeople, some gazing mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered,\r\nothers weeping pitifully.\r\n\r\n“‘“Who is dead in the White House?” I demanded of one of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n“‘“The President,” was his answer; “he was killed by an assassin.”\r\n\r\n“‘Then came a loud burst of grief from the crowd, which awoke me from my\r\ndream. I slept no more that night; and although it was only a dream, I\r\nhave been strangely annoyed by it ever since.’\r\n\r\n“‘That is horrid!’ said Mrs. Lincoln. ‘I wish you had not told it. I am\r\nglad I don’t believe in dreams, or I should be in terror from this time\r\nforth.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ responded Mr. Lincoln, thoughtfully, ‘it is only a dream, Mary.\r\nLet us say no more about it, and try to forget it.’\r\n\r\n“This dream was so horrible, so real, and so in keeping with other\r\ndreams and threatening presentiments of his, that Mr. Lincoln was\r\nprofoundly disturbed by it. During its recital he was grave, gloomy,\r\nand at times visibly pale, but perfectly calm. He spoke slowly, with\r\nmeasured accents and deep feeling.\r\n\r\n“In conversations with me, he referred to it afterwards, closing one\r\nwith this quotation from ‘Hamlet’: ‘To sleep; perchance to dream! ay,\r\nthere’s the rub!’ with a strong accent upon the last three words.\r\n\r\n“Once the President alluded to this terrible dream with some show of\r\nplayful humor. ‘Hill,’ said he, ‘your apprehension of harm to me from\r\nsome hidden enemy is downright foolishness. For a long time you have\r\nbeen trying to keep somebody-the Lord knows who--from killing me.\r\n\r\n“‘Don’t you see how it will turn out? In this dream it was not me, but\r\nsome other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin\r\ntried his hand on some one else. And this reminds me of an old farmer in\r\nIllinois whose family were made sick by eating greens.\r\n\r\n“‘Some poisonous herb had got into the mess, and members of the family\r\nwere in danger of dying. There was a half-witted boy in the family\r\ncalled Jake; and always afterward when they had greens the old man would\r\nsay, “Now, afore we risk these greens, let’s try ‘em on Jake. If he\r\nstands ‘em we’re all right.” Just so with me. As long as this imaginary\r\nassassin continues to exercise himself on others, I can stand it.’\r\n\r\n“He then became serious and said: ‘Well, let it go. I think the Lord in\r\nHis own good time and way will work this out all right. God knows what\r\nis best.’\r\n\r\n“These words he spoke with a sigh, and rather in a tone of soliloquy, as\r\nif hardly noting my presence.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln had another remarkable dream, which was repeated so\r\nfrequently during his occupancy of the White House that he came to\r\nregard it is a welcome visitor. It was of a pleasing and promising\r\ncharacter, having nothing in it of the horrible.\r\n\r\n“It was always an omen of a Union victory, and came with unerring\r\ncertainty just before every military or naval engagement where our arms\r\nwere crowned with success. In this dream he saw a ship sailing away\r\nrapidly, badly damaged, and our victorious vessels in close pursuit.\r\n\r\n“He saw, also, the close of a battle on land, the enemy routed, and our\r\nforces in possession of vantage ground of inestimable importance. Mr.\r\nLincoln stated it as a fact that he had this dream just before the\r\nbattles of Antietam, Gettysburg, and other signal engagements throughout\r\nthe War.\r\n\r\n“The last time Mr. Lincoln had this dream was the night before his\r\nassassination. On the morning of that lamentable day there was a Cabinet\r\nmeeting, at which General Grant was present. During an interval of\r\ngeneral discussion, the President asked General Grant if he had any news\r\nfrom General Sherman, who was then confronting Johnston. The reply was\r\nin the negative, but the general added that he was in hourly expectation\r\nof a dispatch announcing Johnston’s surrender.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln then, with great impressiveness, said, ‘We shall hear very\r\nsoon, and the news will be important.’\r\n\r\n“General Grant asked him why he thought so.\r\n\r\n“‘Because,’ said Mr. Lincoln, ‘I had a dream last night; and ever since\r\nthis War began I have had the same dream just before every event of\r\ngreat national importance. It portends some important event which will\r\nhappen very soon.’\r\n\r\n“On the night of the fateful 14th of April, 1865, Mrs. Lincoln’s\r\nfirst exclamation, after the President was shot, was, ‘His dream was\r\nprophetic!’\r\n\r\n“Lincoln was a believer in certain phases of the supernatural. Assured\r\nas he undoubtedly was by omens which, to his mind, were conclusive, that\r\nhe would rise to greatness and power, he was as firmly convinced by\r\nthe same tokens that he would be suddenly cut off at the height of his\r\ncareer and the fullness of his fame. He always believed that he would\r\nfall by the hand of an assassin.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln had this further idea: Dreams, being natural occurrences,\r\nin the strictest sense, he held that their best interpreters are the\r\ncommon people; and this accounts, in great measure, for the profound\r\nrespect he always had for the collective wisdom of plain people--‘the\r\nchildren of Nature,’ he called them--touching matters belonging to\r\nthe domain of psychical mysteries. There was some basis of truth, he\r\nbelieved, for whatever obtained general credence among these ‘children\r\nof Nature.’\r\n\r\n“Concerning presentiments and dreams, Mr. Lincoln had a philosophy of\r\nhis own, which, strange as it may appear, was in perfect harmony\r\nwith his character in all other respects. He was no dabbler in\r\ndivination--astrology, horoscopy, prophecy, ghostly lore, or witcheries\r\nof any sort.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERY LITTLE HELPED.\r\n\r\nAs the time drew near at which Mr. Lincoln said he would issue the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, some clergymen, who feared the President\r\nmight change his mind, called on him to urge him to keep his promise.\r\n\r\n“We were ushered into the Cabinet room,” says Dr. Sunderland. “It\r\nwas very dim, but one gas jet burning. As we entered, Mr. Lincoln was\r\nstanding at the farther end of the long table, which filled the center\r\nof the room. As I stood by the door, I am so very short, that I was\r\nobliged to look up to see the President. Mr. Robbins introduced me, and\r\nI began at once by saying: ‘I have come, Mr. President, to anticipate\r\nthe new year with my respects, and if I may, to say to you a word about\r\nthe serious condition of this country.’\r\n\r\n“‘Go ahead, Doctor,’ replied the President; ‘every little helps.’ But I\r\nwas too much in earnest to laugh at his sally at my smallness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT TO LAY DOWN THE BURDEN.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln (at times) said he felt sure his life would end with\r\nthe War. A correspondent of a Boston paper had an interview with him in\r\nJuly, 1864, and wrote regarding it:\r\n\r\n“The President told me he was certain he should not outlast the\r\nrebellion. As will be remembered, there was dissension then among the\r\nRepublican leaders. Many of his best friends had deserted him, and were\r\ntalking of an opposition convention to nominate another candidate, and\r\nuniversal gloom was among the people.\r\n\r\n“The North was tired of the War, and supposed an honorable peace\r\nattainable. Mr. Lincoln knew it was not--that any peace at that time\r\nwould be only disunion. Speaking of it, he said: ‘I have faith in the\r\npeople. They will not consent to disunion. The danger is, they are\r\nmisled. Let them know the truth, and the country is safe.’\r\n\r\n“He looked haggard and careworn; and further on in the interview I\r\nremarked on his appearance, ‘You are wearing yourself out with work.’\r\n\r\n“‘I can’t work less,’ he answered; ‘but it isn’t that--work never\r\ntroubled me. Things look badly, and I can’t avoid anxiety. Personally, I\r\ncare nothing about a re-election, but if our divisions defeat us, I fear\r\nfor the country.’\r\n\r\n“When I suggested that right must eventually triumph, he replied, ‘I\r\ngrant that, but I may never live to see it. I feel a presentiment that I\r\nshall not outlast the rebellion. When it is over, my work will be done.’\r\n\r\n“He never intimated, however, that he expected to be assassinated.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley said, some time after the death of President Lincoln:\r\n\r\n“After the Civil War began, Lincoln’s tenacity of purpose paralleled his\r\nformer immobility; I believe he would have been nearly the last, if not\r\nthe very last, man in America to recognize the Southern Confederacy had\r\nits armies been triumphant. He would have preferred death.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“PUNCH” AND HIS LITTLE PICTURE.\r\n\r\nLondon “Punch” was not satisfied with anything President Lincoln did. On\r\nDecember 3rd, 1864, after Mr. Lincoln’s re-election to the Presidency,\r\na cartoon appeared in one of the pages of that genial publication,\r\nthe reproduction being printed here, labeled “The Federal Phoenix.” It\r\nattracted great attention at the time, and was particularly pleasing to\r\nthe enemies of the United States, as it showed Lincoln as the Phoenix\r\narising from the ashes of the Federal Constitution, the Public Credit,\r\nthe Freedom of the Press, State Rights and the Commerce of the North\r\nAmerican Republic.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln’s endorsement by the people of the United States meant\r\nthat the Confederacy was to be crushed, no matter what the cost; that\r\nthe Union of States was to be preserved, and that State Rights was\r\na thing of the past. “Punch” wished to create the impression that\r\nPresident Lincoln’s re-election was a personal victory; that he would\r\nset up a despotism, with himself at its head, and trample upon the\r\nConstitution of the United States and all the rights the citizens of the\r\nRepublic ever possessed.\r\n\r\nThe result showed that “Punch” was suffering from an acute attack of\r\nneedless alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFASCINATED By THE WONDERFUL\r\n\r\nLincoln was particularly fascinated by the wonderful happenings recorded\r\nin history. He loved to read of those mighty events which had been\r\nforetold, and often brooded upon these subjects. His early convictions\r\nupon occult matters led him to read all books tending’ to strengthen\r\nthese convictions.\r\n\r\nThe following lines, in Byron’s “Dream,” were frequently quoted by him:\r\n\r\n         “Sleep hath its own world,\r\n     A boundary between the things misnamed\r\n     Death and existence: Sleep hath its own world\r\n     And a wide realm of wild reality.\r\n     And dreams in their development have breath,\r\n     And tears and tortures, and the touch of joy;\r\n     They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts,\r\n     They take a weight from off our waking toils,\r\n     They do divide our being.”\r\n\r\nThose with whom he was associated in his early youth and young manhood,\r\nand with whom he was always in cordial sympathy, were thorough believers\r\nin presentiments and dreams; and so Lincoln drifted on through years\r\nof toil and exceptional hardship--meditative, aspiring, certain of his\r\nstar, but appalled at times by its malignant aspect. Many times prior to\r\nhis first election to the Presidency he was both elated and alarmed by\r\nwhat seemed to him a rent in the veil which hides from mortal view what\r\nthe future holds.\r\n\r\nHe saw, or thought he saw, a vision of glory and of blood, himself\r\nthe central figure in a scene which his fancy transformed from giddy\r\nenchantment to the most appalling tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHY DON’T THEY COME!”\r\n\r\nThe suspense of the days when the capital was isolated, the expected\r\ntroops not arriving, and an hourly attack feared, wore on Mr. Lincoln\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\n“I begin to believe,” he said bitterly, one day, to some Massachusetts\r\nsoldiers, “that there is no North. The Seventh Regiment is a myth. Rhode\r\nIsland is another. You are the only real thing.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, after pacing the floor of his deserted office for a\r\nhalf-hour, he was heard to exclaim to himself, in an anguished tone:\r\n“Why don’t they come! Why don’t they come!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT’S BRAND OF WHISKEY.\r\n\r\nLincoln was not a man of impulse, and did nothing upon the spur of the\r\nmoment; action with him was the result of deliberation and study. He\r\ntook nothing for granted; he judged men by their performances and not\r\ntheir speech.\r\n\r\nIf a general lost battles, Lincoln lost confidence in him; if a\r\ncommander was successful, Lincoln put him where he would be of the most\r\nservice to the country.\r\n\r\n“Grant is a drunkard,” asserted powerful and influential politicians\r\nto the President at the White House time after time; “he is not himself\r\nhalf the time; he can’t be relied upon, and it is a shame to have such a\r\nman in command of an army.”\r\n\r\n“So Grant gets drunk, does he?” queried Lincoln, addressing himself to\r\none of the particularly active detractors of the soldier, who, at that\r\nperiod, was inflicting heavy damage upon the Confederates.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he does, and I can prove it,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Well,” returned Lincoln, with the faintest suspicion of a twinkle in\r\nhis eye, “you needn’t waste your time getting proof; you just find out,\r\nto oblige me, what brand of whiskey Grant drinks, because I want to send\r\na barrel of it to each one of my generals.”\r\n\r\nThat ended the crusade against Grant, so far as the question of drinking\r\nwas concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FINANCIAL STANDING.\r\n\r\nA New York firm applied to Abraham Lincoln, some years before he became\r\nPresident, for information as to the financial standing of one of his\r\nneighbors. Mr. Lincoln replied:\r\n\r\n“I am well acquainted with Mr.---- and know his circumstances. First of\r\nall, he has a wife and baby; together they ought to be worth $50,000\r\nto any man. Secondly, he has an office in which there is a table worth\r\n$1.50 and three chairs worth, say, $1. Last of all, there is in one\r\ncorner a large rat hole, which will bear looking into. Respectfully,\r\nA. Lincoln.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DANDY AND THE BOYS.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln appointed as consul to a South American country a\r\nyoung man from Ohio who was a dandy. A wag met the new appointee on his\r\nway to the White House to thank the President. He was dressed in the\r\nmost extravagant style. The wag horrified him by telling him that the\r\ncountry to which he was assigned was noted chiefly for the bugs that\r\nabounded there and made life unbearable.\r\n\r\n“They’ll bore a hole clean through you before a week has passed,” was\r\nthe comforting assurance of the wag as they parted at the White House\r\nsteps. The new consul approached Lincoln with disappointment clearly\r\nwritten all over his face. Instead of joyously thanking the President,\r\nhe told him the wag’s story of the bugs. “I am informed, Mr. President,”\r\n he said, “that the place is full of vermin and that they could eat me up\r\nin a week’s time.” “Well, young man,” replied Lincoln, “if that’s true,\r\nall I’ve got to say is that if such a thing happened they would leave a\r\nmighty good suit of clothes behind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“SOME UGLY OLD LAWYER.”\r\n\r\nA. W. Swan, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, told this story on Lincoln,\r\nbeing an eyewitness of the scene:\r\n\r\n“One day President Lincoln was met in the park between the White House\r\nand the War Department by an irate private soldier, who was swearing in\r\na high key, cursing the Government from the President down. Mr. Lincoln\r\npaused and asked him what was the matter. ‘Matter enough,’ was the\r\nreply. ‘I want my money. I have been discharged here, and can’t get my\r\npay.’ Mr. Lincoln asked if he had his papers, saying that he used to\r\npractice law in a small way, and possibly could help him.\r\n\r\n“My friend and I stepped behind some convenient shrubbery where we could\r\nwatch the result. Mr. Lincoln took the papers from the hands of the\r\ncrippled soldier, and sat down with him at the foot of a convenient\r\ntree, where he examined them carefully, and writing a line on the back,\r\ntold the soldier to take them to Mr. Potts, Chief Clerk of the War\r\nDepartment, who would doubtless attend to the matter at once.\r\n\r\n“After Mr. Lincoln had left the soldier, we stepped out and asked him\r\nif he knew whom he had been talking with. ‘Some ugly old fellow who\r\npretends to be a lawyer,’ was the reply. My companion asked to see the\r\npapers, and on their being handed to him, pointed to the indorsement\r\nthey had received: This indorsement read:\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Potts, attend to this man’s case at once and see that he gets his\r\npay. A. L.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD MEMORY OF NAMES.\r\n\r\nThe following story illustrates the power of Mr. Lincoln’s memory of\r\nnames and faces. When he was a comparatively young man, and a candidate\r\nfor the Illinois Legislature, he made a personal canvass of the\r\ndistrict. While “swinging around the circle” he stopped one day and took\r\ndinner with a farmer in Sangamon county.\r\n\r\nYears afterward, when Mr. Lincoln had become President, a soldier\r\ncame to call on him at the White House. At the first glance the Chief\r\nExecutive said: “Yes, I remember; you used to live on the Danville\r\nroad. I took dinner with you when I was running for the Legislature.\r\nI recollect that we stood talking out at the barnyard gate while I\r\nsharpened my jackknife.”\r\n\r\n“Y-a-a-s,” drawled the soldier, “you did. But say, wherever did you put\r\nthat whetstone? I looked for it a dozen times, but I never could find\r\nit after the day you used it. We allowed as how mabby you took it ‘long\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Lincoln, looking serious and pushing away a lot of documents\r\nof state from the desk in front of him. “No, I put it on top of that\r\ngatepost--that high one.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” exclaimed the visitor, “mabby you did. Couldn’t anybody else\r\nhave put it there, and none of us ever thought of looking there for it.”\r\n\r\nThe soldier was then on his way home, and when he got there the first\r\nthing he did was to look for the whetstone. And sure enough, there it\r\nwas, just where Lincoln had laid it fifteen years before. The honest\r\nfellow wrote a letter to the Chief Magistrate, telling him that the\r\nwhetstone had been found, and would never be lost again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLED OUT OF COURT.\r\n\r\nWhen Abe Lincoln used to be drifting around the country, practicing law\r\nin Fulton and Menard counties, Illinois, an old fellow met him going\r\nto Lewiston, riding a horse which, while it was a serviceable enough\r\nanimal, was not of the kind to be truthfully called a fine saddler. It\r\nwas a weatherbeaten nag, patient and plodding, and it toiled along\r\nwith Abe--and Abe’s books, tucked away in saddle-bags, lay heavy on the\r\nhorse’s flank.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Uncle Tommy,” said Abe.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Abe,” responded Uncle Tommy. “I’m powerful glad to see ye, Abe,\r\nfer I’m gwyne to have sumthin’ fer ye at Lewiston co’t, I reckon.”\r\n\r\n“How’s that, Uncle Tommy?” said Abe.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jim Adams, his land runs ‘long o’ mine, he’s pesterin’ me a heap\r\nan’ I got to get the law on Jim, I reckon.”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Tommy, you haven’t had any fights with Jim, have you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“He’s a fair to middling neighbor, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Only tollable, Abe.”\r\n\r\n“He’s been a neighbor of yours for a long time, hasn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Nigh on to fifteen year.”\r\n\r\n“Part of the time you get along all right, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I reckon we do, Abe.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, Uncle Tommy, you see this horse of mine? He isn’t as good a\r\nhorse as I could straddle, and I sometimes get out of patience with him,\r\nbut I know his faults. He does fairly well as horses go, and it might\r\ntake me a long time to get used to some other horse’s faults. For all\r\nhorses have faults. You and Uncle Jimmy must put up with each other as I\r\nand my horse do with one another.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon, Abe,” said Uncle Tommy, as he bit off about four ounces of\r\nMissouri plug. “I reckon you’re about right.”\r\n\r\nAnd Abe Lincoln, with a smile on his gaunt face, rode on toward\r\nLewiston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIVE POINTS SUNDAY SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln visited New York in 1860, he felt a great interest in\r\nmany of the institutions for reforming criminals and saving the young\r\nfrom a life of crime. Among others, he visited, unattended, the Five\r\nPoints House of Industry, and the superintendent of the Sabbath school\r\nthere gave the following account of the event:\r\n\r\n“One Sunday morning I saw a tall, remarkable-looking man enter the\r\nroom and take a seat among us. He listened with fixed attention to our\r\nexercises, and his countenance expressed such genuine interest that I\r\napproached him and suggested that he might be willing to say something\r\nto the children. He accepted the invitation with evident pleasure, and\r\ncoming forward began a simple address, which at once fascinated every\r\nlittle hearer and hushed the room into silence. His language was\r\nstrikingly beautiful, and his tones musical with intense feeling. The\r\nlittle faces would droop into sad conviction when he uttered sentences\r\nof warning, and would brighten into sunshine as he spoke cheerful words\r\nof promise. Once or twice he attempted to close his remarks, but the\r\nimperative shout of, ‘Go on! Oh, do go on!’ would compel him to resume.\r\n\r\n“As I looked upon the gaunt and sinewy frame of the stranger, and marked\r\nhis powerful head and determined features, now touched into softness\r\nby the impressions of the moment, I felt an irrepressible curiosity to\r\nlearn something more about him, and while he was quietly leaving the\r\nroom, I begged to know his name. He courteously replied: ‘It is Abraham\r\nLincoln, from Illinois.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENTINEL OBEYED ORDERS.\r\n\r\nA slight variation of the traditional sentry story is related by C. C.\r\nBuel. It was a cold, blusterous winter night. Says Mr. Buel:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln emerged from the front door, his lank figure bent over as\r\nhe drew tightly about his shoulders the shawl which he employed for such\r\nprotection; for he was on his way to the War Department, at the west\r\ncorner of the grounds, where in times of battle he was wont to get the\r\nmidnight dispatches from the field. As the blast struck him he thought\r\nof the numbness of the pacing sentry, and, turning to him, said: ‘Young\r\nman, you’ve got a cold job to-night; step inside, and stand guard\r\nthere.’\r\n\r\n“‘My orders keep me out here,’ the soldier replied.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ said the President, in his argumentative tone; ‘but your duty\r\ncan be performed just as well inside as out here, and you’ll oblige me\r\nby going in.’\r\n\r\n“‘I have been stationed outside,’ the soldier answered, and resumed his\r\nbeat.\r\n\r\n“‘Hold on there!’ said Mr. Lincoln, as he turned back again; ‘it occurs\r\nto me that I am Commander-in-Chief of the army, and I order you to go\r\ninside.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY LINCOLN GROWED WHISKERS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the majority of people in the United States don’t know why\r\nLincoln “growed” whiskers after his first nomination for the Presidency.\r\nBefore that time his face was clean shaven.\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful village of Westfield, Chautauqua county, New York,\r\nthere lived, in 1860, little Grace Bedell. During the campaign of that\r\nyear she saw a portrait of Lincoln, for whom she felt the love and\r\nreverence that was common in Republican families, and his smooth, homely\r\nface rather disappointed her. She said to her mother: “I think, mother,\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln would look better if he wore whiskers, and I mean to\r\nwrite and tell him so.”\r\n\r\nThe mother gave her permission.\r\n\r\nGrace’s father was a Republican; her two brothers were Democrats.\r\nGrace wrote at once to the “Hon. Abraham Lincoln, Esq., Springfield,\r\nIllinois,” in which she told him how old she was, and where she lived;\r\nthat she was a Republican; that she thought he would make a good\r\nPresident, but would look better if he would let his whiskers grow. If\r\nhe would do so, she would try to coax her brothers to vote for him. She\r\nthought the rail fence around the picture of his cabin was very pretty.\r\n“If you have not time to answer my letter, will you allow your little\r\ngirl to reply for you?”\r\n\r\nLincoln was much pleased with the letter, and decided to answer it,\r\nwhich he did at once, as follows:\r\n\r\n“Springfield, Illinois, October 19, 1860.\r\n\r\n“Miss Grace Bedell.\r\n\r\n“My Dear Little Miss: Your very agreeable letter of the fifteenth is\r\nreceived. I regret the necessity of saying I have no daughter. I have\r\nthree sons; one seventeen, one nine and one seven years of age. They,\r\nwith their mother, constitute my whole family. As to the whiskers,\r\nhaving never worn any, do you not think people would call it a piece\r\nof silly affectation if I should begin it now? Your very sincere\r\nwell-wisher, A. LINCOLN.”\r\n\r\nWhen on the journey to Washington to be inaugurated, Lincoln’s train\r\nstopped at Westfield. He recollected his little correspondent and spoke\r\nof her to ex-Lieutenant Governor George W. Patterson, who called out and\r\nasked if Grace Bedell was present.\r\n\r\nThere was a large surging mass of people gathered about the train, but\r\nGrace was discovered at a distance; the crowd opened a pathway to the\r\ncoach, and she came, timidly but gladly, to the President-elect, who\r\ntold her that she might see that he had allowed his whiskers to grow at\r\nher request. Then, reaching out his long arms, he drew her up to him and\r\nkissed her. The act drew an enthusiastic demonstration of approval from\r\nthe multitude.\r\n\r\nGrace married a Kansas banker, and became Grace Bedell Billings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AS A DANCER.\r\n\r\nLincoln made his first appearance in society when he was first sent to\r\nSpringfield, Ill., as a member of the State Legislature. It was not\r\nan imposing figure which he cut in a ballroom, but still he was\r\noccasionally to be found there. Miss Mary Todd, who afterward became\r\nhis wife, was the magnet which drew the tall, awkward young man from his\r\nden. One evening Lincoln approached Miss Todd, and said, in his peculiar\r\nidiom:\r\n\r\n“Miss Todd, I should like to dance with you the worst way.” The young\r\nwoman accepted the inevitable, and hobbled around the room with him.\r\nWhen she returned to her seat, one of her companions asked mischievously:\r\n\r\n“Well, Mary, did he dance with you the worst way.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered, “the very worst.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLY PRACTICAL HUMANITY.\r\n\r\nAn instance of young Lincoln’s practical humanity at an early period of\r\nhis life is recorded in this way:\r\n\r\nOne evening, while returning from a “raising” in his wide neighborhood,\r\nwith a number of companions, he discovered a stray horse, with saddle\r\nand bridle upon him. The horse was recognized as belonging to a man who\r\nwas accustomed to get drunk, and it was suspected at once that he was\r\nnot far off. A short search only was necessary to confirm the belief.\r\n\r\nThe poor drunkard was found in a perfectly helpless condition, upon the\r\nchilly ground. Abraham’s companions urged the cowardly policy of leaving\r\nhim to his fate, but young Lincoln would not hear to the proposition.\r\n\r\nAt his request, the miserable sot was lifted on his shoulders, and he\r\nactually carried him eighty rods to the nearest house.\r\n\r\nSending word to his father that he should not be back that night, with\r\nthe reason for his absence, he attended and nursed the man until the\r\nmorning, and had the pleasure of believing that he had saved his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAPPY FIGURES OF SPEECH.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, exasperated at the discrepancy between the aggregate of\r\ntroops forwarded to McClellan and the number that same general reported\r\nas having received, Lincoln exclaimed: “Sending men to that army is like\r\nshoveling fleas across a barnyard--half of them never get there.”\r\n\r\nTo a politician who had criticised his course, he wrote: “Would you have\r\nme drop the War where it is, or would you prosecute it in future with\r\nelder stalk squirts charged with rosewater?”\r\n\r\nWhen, on his first arrival in Washington as President, he found himself\r\nbesieged by office-seekers, while the War was breaking out, he said: “I\r\nfeel like a man letting lodgings at one end of his house while the other\r\nend is on fire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW “RHYTHMIC SHOTS.”\r\n\r\nWard Lamon, Marshal of the District of Columbia during Lincoln’s time in\r\nWashington, accompanied the President everywhere. He was a good singer,\r\nand, when Lincoln was in one of his melancholy moods, would “fire a few\r\nrhythmic shots” at the President to cheer the latter. Lincoln keenly\r\nrelished nonsense in the shape of witty or comic ditties. A parody of “A\r\nLife on the Ocean Wave” was always pleasing to him:\r\n\r\n     “Oh, a life on the ocean wave,\r\n       And a home on the rolling deep!\r\n     With ratlins fried three times a day\r\n       And a leaky old berth for to sleep;\r\n     Where the gray-beard cockroach roams,\r\n       On thoughts of kind intent,\r\n     And the raving bedbug comes\r\n       The road the cockroach went.”\r\n\r\nLincoln could not control his laughter when he heard songs of this sort.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of negro melodies, too, and “The Blue-Tailed Fly” was a\r\ngreat favorite with him. He often called for that buzzing ballad when\r\nhe and Lamon were alone, and he wanted to throw off the weight of public\r\nand private cares. The ballad of “The Blue-Tailed Fly” contained two\r\nverses, which ran:\r\n\r\n     “When I was young I used to wait\r\n     At massa’s table, ‘n’ hand de plate,\r\n     An’ pass de bottle when he was dry,\r\n     An’ brush away de blue-tailed fly.\r\n\r\n     “Ol’ Massa’s dead; oh, let him rest!\r\n     Dey say all things am for de best;\r\n     But I can’t forget until I die\r\n     Ol’ massa an’ de blue-tailed fly.”\r\n\r\nWhile humorous songs delighted the President, he also loved to listen to\r\npatriotic airs and ballads containing sentiment. He was fond of hearing\r\n“The Sword of Bunker Hill,” “Ben Bolt,” and “The Lament of the Irish\r\nEmigrant.” His preference of the verses in the latter was this:\r\n\r\n     “I’m lonely now, Mary,\r\n       For the poor make no new friends;\r\n     But, oh, they love the better still\r\n       The few our Father sends!\r\n     And you were all I had, Mary,\r\n       My blessing and my pride;\r\n     There’s nothing left to care for now,\r\n       Since my poor Mary died.”\r\n\r\nThose who knew Lincoln were well aware he was incapable of so monstrous\r\nan act as that of wantonly insulting the dead, as was charged in the\r\ninfamous libel which asserted that he listened to a comic song on the\r\nfield of Antietam, before the dead were buried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD MAN GLENN’S RELIGION.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln once remarked to a friend that his religion was like that\r\nof an old man named Glenn, in Indiana, whom he heard speak at a church\r\nmeeting, and who said: “When I do good, I feel good; when I do bad, I\r\nfeel bad; and that’s my religion.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln herself has said that Mr. Lincoln had no faith--no faith,\r\nin the usual acceptance of those words. “He never joined a church; but\r\nstill, as I believe, he was a religious man by nature. He first seemed\r\nto think about the subject when our boy Willie died, and then more than\r\never about the time he went to Gettysburg; but it was a kind of poetry\r\nin his nature, and he never was a technical Christian.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST ACTS OF MERCY.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon preceding his assassination the President signed a\r\npardon for a soldier sentenced to be shot for desertion, remarking as\r\nhe did so, “Well, I think the boy can do us more good above ground than\r\nunder ground.”\r\n\r\nHe also approved an application for the discharge, on taking the oath of\r\nallegiance, of a rebel prisoner, in whose petition he wrote, “Let it be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nThis act of mercy was his last official order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST LIKE SEWARD.\r\n\r\nThe first corps of the army commanded by General Reynolds was once\r\nreviewed by the President on a beautiful plain at the north of Potomac\r\nCreek, about eight miles from Hooker’s headquarters. The party rode\r\nthither in an ambulance over a rough corduroy road, and as they\r\npassed over some of the more difficult portions of the jolting way the\r\nambulance driver, who sat well in front, occasionally let fly a volley\r\nof suppressed oaths at his wild team of six mules.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Lincoln, leaning forward, touched the man on the shoulder\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, my friend, are you an Episcopalian?”\r\n\r\nThe man, greatly startled, looked around and replied:\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. President; I am a Methodist.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lincoln, “I thought you must be an Episcopalian, because\r\nyou swear just like Governor Seward, who is a church warder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHEERFUL PROSPECT.\r\n\r\nThe first night after the departure of President-elect Lincoln from\r\nSpringfield, on his way to Washington, was spent in Indianapolis.\r\nGovernor Yates, O. H. Browning, Jesse K. Dubois, O. M. Hatch, Josiah\r\nAllen, of Indiana, and others, after taking leave of Mr. Lincoln to\r\nreturn to their respective homes, took Ward Lamon into a room, locked\r\nthe door, and proceeded in the most solemn and impressive manner to\r\ninstruct him as to his duties as the special guardian of Mr. Lincoln’s\r\nperson during the rest of his journey to Washington. Lamon tells the\r\nstory as follows:\r\n\r\n“The lesson was concluded by Uncle Jesse, as Mr. Dubois was commonly,\r\ncalled, who said:\r\n\r\n“‘Now, Lamon, we have regarded you as the Tom Hyer of Illinois, with\r\nMorrissey attachment. We intrust the sacred life of Mr. Lincoln to your\r\nkeeping; and if you don’t protect it, never return to Illinois, for we\r\nwill murder you on sight.”’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT GOD WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jonathan Baldwin Turner was one of the few men to whom\r\nMr. Lincoln confided his intention to issue the Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln told his Illinois friend of the visit of a delegation to\r\nhim who claimed to have a message from God that the War would not be\r\nsuccessful without the freeing of the negroes, to whom Mr. Lincoln\r\nreplied: “Is it not a little strange that He should tell this to you,\r\nwho have so little to do with it, and should not have told me, who has a\r\ngreat deal to do with it?”\r\n\r\nAt the same time he informed Professor Turner he had his Proclamation in\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND A BIBLE HERO.\r\n\r\nA writer who heard Mr. Lincoln’s famous speech delivered in New York\r\nafter his nomination for President has left this record of the event:\r\n\r\n“When Lincoln rose to speak, I was greatly disappointed. He was tall,\r\ntall, oh, so tall, and so angular and awkward that I had for an instant\r\na feeling of pity for so ungainly a man. He began in a low tone of\r\nvoice, as if he were used to speaking out of doors and was afraid of\r\nspeaking too loud.\r\n\r\n“He said ‘Mr. Cheerman,’ instead of ‘Mr. Chairman,’ and employed many\r\nother words with an old-fashioned pronunciation. I said to myself, ‘Old\r\nfellow, you won’t do; it is all very well for the Wild West, but this\r\nwill never go down in New York.’ But pretty soon he began to get into\r\nthe subject; he straightened up, made regular and graceful gestures; his\r\nface lighted as with an inward fire; the whole man was transfigured.\r\n\r\n“I forgot the clothing, his personal appearance, and his individual\r\npeculiarities. Presently, forgetting myself, I was on my feet with the\r\nrest, yelling like a wild Indian, cheering the wonderful man. In the\r\nclose parts of his argument you could hear the gentle sizzling of the\r\ngas burners.\r\n\r\n“When he reached a climax the thunders of applause were terrific. It\r\nwas a great speech. When I came out of the hall my face was glowing with\r\nexcitement and my frame all a-quiver. A friend, with his eyes aglow,\r\nasked me what I thought of ‘Abe’ Lincoln, the rail-splitter. I said,\r\n‘He’s the greatest man since St. Paul.’ And I think so yet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOY WAS CARED FOR.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln one day noticed a small, pale, delicate-looking\r\nboy, about thirteen years old, among the number in the White House\r\nantechamber.\r\n\r\nThe President saw him standing there, looking so feeble and faint, and\r\nsaid: “Come here, my boy, and tell me what you want.”\r\n\r\nThe boy advanced, placed his hand on the arm of the President’s chair,\r\nand, with a bowed head and timid accents, said: “Mr. President, I have\r\nbeen a drummer boy in a regiment for two years, and my colonel got angry\r\nwith me and turned me off. I was taken sick and have been a long time in\r\nthe hospital.”\r\n\r\nThe President discovered that the boy had no home, no father--he had\r\ndied in the army--no mother.\r\n\r\n“I have no father, no mother, no brothers, no sisters, and,” bursting\r\ninto tears, “no friends--nobody cares for me.”\r\n\r\nLincoln’s eyes filled with tears, and the boy’s heart was soon made glad\r\nby a request to certain officials “to care for this poor boy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JURY ACQUITTED HIM\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted murder cases in which Lincoln defended the accused\r\nwas tried in August, 1859. The victim, Crafton, was a student in his\r\nown law office, the defendant, “Peachy” Harrison, was a grandson of\r\nRev. Peter Cartwright; both were connected with the best families in the\r\ncounty; they were brothers-in-law, and had always been friends.\r\n\r\nSenator John M. Palmer and General John A. McClelland were on the side\r\nof the prosecution. Among those who represented the defendant were\r\nLincoln and Senator Shelby M. Cullom. The two young men had engaged in\r\na political quarrel, and Crafton was stabbed to death by Harrison. The\r\ntragic pathos of a case which involved the deepest affections of almost\r\nan entire community reached its climax in the appearance in court of the\r\nvenerable Peter Cartwright. Lincoln had beaten him for Congress in 1846.\r\n\r\nEccentric and aggressive as he was, he was honored far and wide; and\r\nwhen he arose to take the witness stand, his white hair crowned\r\nwith this cruel sorrow, the most indifferent spectator felt that his\r\nexamination would be unbearable.\r\n\r\nIt fell to Lincoln to question Cartwright. With the rarest gentleness he\r\nbegan to put his questions.\r\n\r\n“How long have you known the prisoner?”\r\n\r\nCartwright’s head dropped on his breast for a moment; then straightening\r\nhimself, he passed his hand across his eyes and answered in a deep,\r\nquavering voice:\r\n\r\n“I have known him since a babe, he laughed and cried on my knee.”\r\n\r\nThe examination ended by Lincoln drawing from the witness the story of\r\nhow Crafton had said to him, just before his death: “I am dying; I will\r\nsoon part with all I love on earth, and I want you to say to my slayer\r\nthat I forgive him. I want to leave this earth with a forgiveness of all\r\nwho have in any way injured me.”\r\n\r\nThis examination made a profound impression on the jury. Lincoln closed\r\nhis argument by picturing the scene anew, appealing to the jury to\r\npractice the same forgiving spirit that the murdered man had shown on\r\nhis death-bed. It was undoubtedly to his handling of the grandfather’s\r\nevidence that Harrison’s acquittal was due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOK NOTHING BUT MONEY.\r\n\r\nDuring the War Congress appropriated $10,000 to be expended by the\r\nPresident in defending United States Marshals in cases of arrests and\r\nseizures where the legality of their actions was tested in the courts.\r\nPreviously the Marshals sought the assistance of the Attorney-General\r\nin defending them, but when they found that the President had a fund for\r\nthat purpose they sought to control the money.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of these Marshals one day, Mr. Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n“They are like a man in Illinois, whose cabin was burned down, and,\r\naccording to the kindly custom of early days in the West, his neighbors\r\nall contributed something to start him again. In his case they had been\r\nso liberal that he soon found himself better off than before the fire,\r\nand he got proud. One day a neighbor brought him a bag of oats, but the\r\nfellow refused it with scorn.\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ said he, ‘I’m not taking oats now. I take nothing but money.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUGHTY BOY HAD TO TAKE HIS MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to the military draft of 1863 by the City of New York,\r\nthe result of which was the killing of several thousand persons,\r\nwas illustrated on August 29th, 1863, by “Frank Leslie’s Illustrated\r\nNewspaper,” over the title of “The Naughty Boy, Gotham, Who Would Not\r\nTake the Draft.” Beneath was also the text:\r\n\r\nMAMMY LINCOLN: “There now, you bad boy, acting that way, when your\r\nlittle sister Penn (State of Pennsylvania) takes hers like a lady!”\r\n\r\nHoratio Seymour was then Governor of New York, and a prominent “the War\r\nis a failure” advocate. He was in Albany, the State capital, when the\r\nriots broke out in the City of New York, July 13th, and after the mob\r\nhad burned the Colored Orphan Asylum and killed several hundred negroes,\r\ncame to the city. He had only soft words for the rioters, promising them\r\nthat the draft should be suspended. Then the Government sent several\r\nregiments of veterans, fresh from the field of Gettysburg, where they\r\nhad assisted in defeating Lee. These troops made short work of the\r\nbrutal ruffians, shooting down three thousand or so of them, and the\r\nrioting was subdued. The “Naughty Boy Gotham” had to take his medicine,\r\nafter all, but as the spirit of opposition to the War was still rampant,\r\nthe President issued a proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus\r\nin all the States of the Union where the Government had control. This\r\nhad a quieting effect upon those who were doing what they could in\r\nobstructing the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOULD BLOW THEM TO H---.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had advised Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott, commanding\r\nthe United States Army, of the threats of violence on inauguration day,\r\n1861. General Scott was sick in bed at Washington when Adjutant-General\r\nThomas Mather, of Illinois, called upon him in President-elect Lincoln’s\r\nbehalf, and the veteran commander was much wrought up. Said he to\r\nGeneral Mather:\r\n\r\n“Present my compliments to Mr. Lincoln when you return to Springfield,\r\nand tell him I expect him to come on to Washington as soon as he is\r\nready; say to him that I will look after those Maryland and Virginia\r\nrangers myself. I will plant cannon at both ends of Pennsylvania avenue,\r\nand if any of them show their heads or raise a finger, I’ll blow them to\r\nh---.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“YANKEE” GOODNESS OF HEART.\r\n\r\nOne day, when the President was with the troops who were fighting at the\r\nfront, the wounded, both Union and Confederate, began to pour in.\r\n\r\nAs one stretcher was passing Lincoln, he heard the voice of a lad\r\ncalling to his mother in agonizing tones. His great heart filled. He\r\nforgot the crisis of the hour. Stopping the carriers, he knelt, and\r\nbending over him, asked: “What can I do for you, my poor child?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you will do nothing for me,” he replied. “You are a Yankee. I\r\ncannot hope that my message to my mother will ever reach her.”\r\n\r\nLincoln, in tears, his voice full of tenderest love, convinced the boy\r\nof his sincerity, and he gave his good-bye words without reserve.\r\n\r\nThe President directed them copied, and ordered that they be sent that\r\nnight, with a flag of truce, into the enemy’s lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALKED AS HE TALKED.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln made his famous humorous speech in Congress ridiculing\r\nGeneral Cass, he began to speak from notes, but, as he warmed up,\r\nhe left his desk and his notes, to stride down the alley toward the\r\nSpeaker’s chair.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, as he would complete a sentence amid shouts of laughter,\r\nhe would return up the alley to his desk, consult his notes, take a sip\r\nof water and start off again.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln received many congratulations at the close, Democrats\r\njoining the Whigs in their complimentary comments.\r\n\r\nOne Democrat, however (who had been nicknamed “Sausage” Sawyer), didn’t\r\nenthuse at all.\r\n\r\n“Sawyer,” asked an Eastern Representative, “how did you like the lanky\r\nIllinoisan’s speech? Very able, wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Sawyer, “the speech was pretty good, but I hope he won’t\r\ncharge mileage on his travels while delivering it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG DID THE BUSINESS.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia (Ill.) Enquirer, of March 1, 1879, tells this story:\r\n\r\n“John McNamer was buried last Sunday, near Petersburg, Menard county. A\r\nlong while ago he was Assessor and Treasurer of the County for several\r\nsuccessive terms. Mr. McNamer was an early settler in that section, and,\r\nbefore the town of Petersburg was laid out, in business in Old Salem, a\r\nvillage that existed many years ago two miles south of the present site\r\nof Petersburg.\r\n\r\n“‘Abe’ Lincoln was then postmaster of the place and sold whisky to its\r\ninhabitants. There are old-timers yet living in Menard who bought many\r\na jug of corn-juice from ‘Old Abe’ when he lived at Salem. It was here\r\nthat Anne Rutledge dwelt, and in whose grave Lincoln wrote that his\r\nheart was buried.\r\n\r\n“As the story runs, the fair and gentle Anne was originally John\r\nMcNamer’s sweetheart, but ‘Abe’ took a ‘shine’ to the young lady,\r\nand succeeded in heading off McNamer and won her affections. But Anne\r\nRutledge died, and Lincoln went to Springfield, where he some time\r\nafterwards married.\r\n\r\n“It is related that during the War a lady belonging to a prominent\r\nKentucky family visited Washington to beg for her son’s pardon, who\r\nwas then in prison under sentence of death for belonging to a band of\r\nguerrillas who had committed many murders and outrages.\r\n\r\n“With the mother was her daughter, a beautiful young lady, who was an\r\naccomplished musician. Mr. Lincoln received the visitors in his\r\nusual kind manner, and the mother made known the object of her visit,\r\naccompanying her plea with tears and sobs and all the customary romantic\r\nincidents.\r\n\r\n“There were probably extenuating circumstances in favor of the young\r\nrebel prisoner, and while the President seemed to be deeply pondering\r\nthe young lady moved to a piano near by and taking a seat commenced to\r\nsing ‘Gentle Annie,’ a very sweet and pathetic ballad which, before the\r\nWar, was a familiar song in almost every household in the Union, and is\r\nnot yet entirely forgotten, for that matter.\r\n\r\n“It is to be presumed that the young lady sang the song with\r\nmore plaintiveness and effect than ‘Old Abe’ had ever heard it in\r\nSpringfield. During its rendition, he arose from his seat, crossed the\r\nroom to a window in the westward, through which he gazed for several\r\nminutes with a ‘sad, far-away look,’ which has so often been noted as\r\none of his peculiarities.\r\n\r\n“His memory, no doubt, went back to the days of his humble life on the\r\nSangamon, and with visions of Old Salem and its rustic people, who once\r\ngathered in his primitive store, came a picture of the ‘Gentle Annie’\r\nof his youth, whose ashes had rested for many long years under the wild\r\nflowers and brambles of the old rural burying-ground, but whose spirit\r\nthen, perhaps, guided him to the side of mercy.\r\n\r\n“Be that as it may, President Lincoln drew a large red silk handkerchief\r\nfrom his coatpocket, with which he wiped his face vigorously. Then\r\nhe turned, advanced quickly to his desk, wrote a brief note, which he\r\nhanded to the lady, and informed her that it was the pardon she sought.\r\n\r\n“The scene was no doubt touching in a great degree and proves that a\r\nnice song, well sung, has often a powerful influence in recalling tender\r\nrecollections. It proves, also, that Abraham Lincoln was a man of fine\r\nfeelings, and that, if the occurrence was a put-up job on the lady’s\r\npart, it accomplished the purpose all the same.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA “FREE FOR ALL.”\r\n\r\nLincoln made a political speech at Pappsville, Illinois, when a\r\ncandidate for the Legislature the first time. A free-for-all fight began\r\nsoon after the opening of the meeting, and Lincoln, noticing one of\r\nhis friends about to succumb to the energetic attack of an infuriated\r\nruffian, edged his way through the crowd, and, seizing the bully by the\r\nneck and the seat of his trousers, threw him, by means of his strength\r\nand long arms, as one witness stoutly insists, “twelve feet away.”\r\n Returning to the stand, and throwing aside his hat, he inaugurated his\r\ncampaign with the following brief but pertinent declaration:\r\n\r\n“Fellow-citizens, I presume you all know who I am. I am humble Abraham\r\nLincoln. I have been solicited by many friends to become a candidate for\r\nthe Legislature. My politics are short and sweet, like the old woman’s\r\ndance. I am in favor of the national bank; I am in favor of the\r\ninternal improvement system and a high protective tariff. These are my\r\nsentiments; if elected, I shall be thankful; if not, it will be all the\r\nsame.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE INFERNAL BORES.\r\n\r\nOne day, when President Lincoln was alone and busily engaged on an\r\nimportant subject, involving vexation and anxiety, he was disturbed by\r\nthe unwarranted intrusion of three men, who, without apology, proceeded\r\nto lay their claim before him.\r\n\r\nThe spokesman of the three reminded the President that they were\r\nthe owners of some torpedo or other warlike invention which, if the\r\ngovernment would only adopt it, would soon crush the rebellion.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the spokesman, “we have been here to see you time and again;\r\nyou have referred us to the Secretary of War, the Chief of Ordnance, and\r\nthe General of the Army, and they give us no satisfaction. We have been\r\nkept here waiting, till money and patience are exhausted, and we now\r\ncome to demand of you a final reply to our application.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln listened to this insolent tirade, and at its close the old\r\ntwinkle came into his eye.\r\n\r\n“You three gentlemen remind me of a story I once heard,” said he, “of a\r\npoor little boy out West who had lost his mother. His father wanted to\r\ngive him a religious education, and so placed him in the family of a\r\nclergyman, whom he directed to instruct the little fellow carefully in\r\nthe Scriptures. Every day the boy had to commit to memory and recite one\r\nchapter of the Bible. Things proceeded smoothly until they reached that\r\nchapter which details the story of the trial of Shadrach, Meshach and\r\nAbednego in the fiery furnace. When asked to repeat these three names\r\nthe boy said he had forgotten them.\r\n\r\n“His teacher told him that he must learn them, and gave him another day\r\nto do so. The next day the boy again forgot them.\r\n\r\n“‘Now,’ said the teacher, ‘you have again failed to remember those names\r\nand you can go no farther until you have learned them. I will give you\r\nanother day on this lesson, and if you don’t repeat the names I will\r\npunish you.’\r\n\r\n“A third time the boy came to recite, and got down to the stumbling\r\nblock, when the clergyman said: ‘Now tell me the names of the men in the\r\nfiery furnace.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh,’ said the boy, ‘here come those three infernal bores! I wish the\r\ndevil had them!’”\r\n\r\nHaving received their “final answer,” the three patriots retired, and at\r\nthe Cabinet meeting which followed, the President, in high good humor,\r\nrelated how he had dismissed his unwelcome visitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S MEN WERE “HUSTLERS.”\r\n\r\nIn the Chicago Convention of 1860 the fight for Seward was maintained\r\nwith desperate resolve until the final ballot was taken. Thurlow Weed\r\nwas the Seward leader, and he was simply incomparable as a master in\r\nhandling a convention. With him were Governor Morgan, Henry J. Raymond,\r\nof the New York Times, with William M. Evarts as chairman of the New\r\nYork delegation, whose speech nominating Seward was the most impressive\r\nutterance of his life. The Bates men (Bates was afterwards Lincoln’s\r\nAttorney-General) were led by Frank Blair, the only Republican\r\nCongressman from a slave State, who was nothing if not heroic, aided by\r\nhis brother Montgomery (afterwards Lincoln’s Postmaster General), who\r\nwas a politician of uncommon cunning. With them was Horace Greeley, who\r\nwas chairman of the delegation from the then almost inaccessible State\r\nof Oregon.\r\n\r\nIt was Lincoln’s friends, however, who were the “hustlers” of that\r\nbattle. They had men for sober counsel like David Davis; men of supreme\r\nsagacity like Leonard Swett; men of tireless effort like Norman B. Judd;\r\nand they had what was more important than all--a seething multitude wild\r\nwith enthusiasm for “Old Abe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SLOW HORSE.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when Mr. Lincoln was going to attend a political\r\nconvention one of his rivals, a liveryman, provided him with a slow\r\nhorse, hoping that he would not reach his destination in time. Mr.\r\nLincoln got there, however, and when he returned with the horse he said:\r\n“You keep this horse for funerals, don’t you?” “Oh, no,” replied the\r\nliveryman. “Well, I’m glad of that, for if you did you’d never get a\r\ncorpse to the grave in time for the resurrection.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDODGING “BROWSING PRESIDENTS.”\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan, after being put in command of the Army, resented any\r\n“interference” by the President. Lincoln, in his anxiety to know\r\nthe details of the work in the army, went frequently to McClellan’s\r\nheadquarters. That the President had a serious purpose in these visits\r\nMcClellan did not see.\r\n\r\n“I enclose a card just received from ‘A. Lincoln,’” he wrote to his wife\r\none day; “it shows too much deference to be seen outside.”\r\n\r\nIn another letter to Mrs. McClellan he spoke of being “interrupted” by\r\nthe President and Secretary Seward, “who had nothing in particular to\r\nsay,” and again of concealing himself “to dodge all enemies in shape of\r\n‘browsing’ Presidents,” etc.\r\n\r\n“I am becoming daily more disgusted with this Administration--perfectly\r\nsick of it,” he wrote early in October; and a few days later, “I was\r\nobliged to attend a meeting of the Cabinet at 8 P. M., and was bored and\r\nannoyed. There are some of the greatest geese in the Cabinet I have ever\r\nseen--enough to tax the patience of Job.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREENBACK LEGEND.\r\n\r\nAt a Cabinet meeting once, the advisability of putting a legend on\r\ngreenbacks similar to the In God We Trust legend on the silver coins was\r\ndiscussed, and the President was asked what his view was. He replied:\r\n“If you are going to put a legend on the greenback, I would suggest that\r\nof Peter and Paul: ‘Silver and gold we have not, but what we have we’ll\r\ngive you.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOD’S BEST GIFT TO MAN.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Lincoln’s notable religious utterances was his reply to a\r\ndeputation of colored people at Baltimore who presented him a Bible. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“In regard to the great book, I have only to say it is the best gift\r\nwhich God has ever given man. All the good from the Savior of the world\r\nis communicated to us through this book. But for this book we could not\r\nknow right from wrong. All those things desirable to man are contained\r\nin it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALPING IN THE BLACK HAWK WAR.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln was President he told this story of the Black Hawk War:\r\n\r\nThe only time he ever saw blood in this campaign, was one morning when,\r\nmarching up a little valley that makes into the Rock River bottom, to\r\nreinforce a squad of outposts that were thought to be in danger, they\r\ncame upon the tent occupied by the other party just at sunrise. The men\r\nhad neglected to place any guard at night, and had been slaughtered in\r\ntheir sleep.\r\n\r\nAs the reinforcing party came up the slope on which the camp had been\r\nmade, Lincoln saw them all lying with their heads towards the rising\r\nsun, and the round red spot that marked where they had been scalped\r\ngleamed more redly yet in the ruddy light of the sun. This scene years\r\nafterwards he recalled with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATRIMONIAL ADVICE.\r\n\r\nFor a while during the Civil War, General Fremont was without a command.\r\nOne day in discussing Fremont’s case with George W. Julian, President\r\nLincoln said he did not know where to place him, and that it reminds him\r\nof the old man who advised his son to take a wife, to which the young\r\nman responded: “All right; whose wife shall I take?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOWED LOTS OF MONEY.\r\n\r\nOn April 14, 1865, a few hours previous to his assassination, President\r\nLincoln sent a message by Congressman Schuyler Colfax, Vice-President\r\nduring General Grant’s first term, to the miners in the Rocky Mountains\r\nand the regions bounded by the Pacific ocean, in which he said:\r\n\r\n“Now that the Rebellion is overthrown, and we know pretty nearly the\r\namount of our National debt, the more gold and silver we mine, we make\r\nthe payment of that debt so much easier.\r\n\r\n“Now I am going to encourage that in every possible way. We shall have\r\nhundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers, and many have feared that\r\ntheir return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry by\r\nfurnishing, suddenly, a greater supply of labor than there will be\r\ndemand for. I am going to try to attract them to the hidden wealth of\r\nour mountain ranges, where there is room enough for all. Immigration,\r\nwhich even the War has not stopped, will land upon our shores hundreds\r\nof thousands more per year from overcrowded Europe. I intend to point\r\nthem to the gold and silver that wait for them in the West.\r\n\r\n“Tell the miners for me that I shall promote their interests to the\r\nutmost of my ability; because their prosperity as the prosperity of\r\nthe nation; and,” said he, his eye kindling with enthusiasm, “we shall\r\nprove, in a very few years, that we are indeed the treasury of the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ON THE LORD’S SIDE.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln made a significant remark to a clergyman in the early\r\ndays of the War.\r\n\r\n“Let us have faith, Mr. President,” said the minister, “that the Lord is\r\non our side in this great struggle.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln quietly answered: “I am not at all concerned about that, for\r\nI know that the Lord is always on the side of the right; but it is my\r\nconstant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation may be on the Lord’s\r\nside.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED TO BE NEAR “ABE.”\r\n\r\nIt was Lincoln’s custom to hold an informal reception once a week, each\r\ncaller taking his turn.\r\n\r\nUpon one of these eventful days an old friend from Illinois stood in\r\nline for almost an hour. At last he was so near the President his voice\r\ncould reach him, and, calling out to his old associate, he startled\r\nevery one by exclaiming, “Hallo, ‘Abe’; how are ye? I’m in line and hev\r\ncome for an orfice, too.”\r\n\r\nLincoln singled out the man with the stentorian voice, and recognizing\r\na particularly old friend, one whose wife had befriended him at a\r\npeculiarly trying time, the President responded to his greeting in a\r\ncordial manner, and told him “to hang onto himself and not kick the\r\ntraces. Keep in line and you’ll soon get here.”\r\n\r\nThey met and shook hands with the old fervor and renewed their\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nThe informal reception over, Lincoln sent for his old friend, and the\r\nlatter began to urge his claims.\r\n\r\nAfter having given him some good advice, Lincoln kindly told him he\r\nwas incapable of holding any such position as he asked for. The\r\ndisappointment of the Illinois friend was plainly shown, and with a\r\nperceptible tremor in his voice he said, “Martha’s dead, the gal is\r\nmarried, and I’ve guv Jim the forty.”\r\n\r\nThen looking at Lincoln he came a little nearer and almost whispered, “I\r\nknowed I wasn’t eddicated enough to git the place, but I kinder want to\r\nstay where I ken see ‘Abe’ Lincoln.”\r\n\r\nHe was given employment in the White House grounds.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the President said, “These brief interviews, stripped of\r\neven the semblance of ceremony, give me a better insight into the real\r\ncharacter of the person and his true reason for seeking one.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOT HIS FOOT IN IT.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Seward, idol of the Republicans of the East, six months after\r\nLincoln had made his “Divided House” speech, delivered an address at\r\nRochester, New York, containing this famous sentence:\r\n\r\n“It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces,\r\nand it means that the United States must, and will, sooner or later,\r\nbecome either entirely a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor\r\nnation.”\r\n\r\nSeward, who had simply followed in Lincoln’s steps, was defeated for the\r\nPresidential nomination at the Republican National Convention of 1860,\r\nbecause he was “too radical,” and Lincoln, who was still “radicaler,”\r\n was named.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVED BY A LETTER.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of the Illinois campaign of 1843 lay in the race\r\nfor Congress in the Capital district, which was between Hardin--fiery,\r\neloquent, and impetuous Democrat--and Lincoln--plain, practical, and\r\nennobled Whig. The world knows the result. Lincoln was elected.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much his election as the manner in which he secured his\r\nnomination with which we have to deal. Before that ever-memorable spring\r\nLincoln vacillated between the courts of Springfield, rated as a plain,\r\nhonest, logical Whig, with no ambition higher politically than to occupy\r\nsome good home office.\r\n\r\nLate in the fall of 1842 his name began to be mentioned in connection\r\nwith Congressional aspirations, which fact greatly annoyed the leaders\r\nof his political party, who had already selected as the Whig candidate\r\nE. D. Baker, afterward the gallant Colonel who fell so bravely and died\r\nsuch an honorable death on the battlefield of Ball’s Bluff.\r\n\r\nDespite all efforts of his opponents within his party, the name of the\r\n“gaunt rail-splitter” was hailed with acclaim by the masses, to whom\r\nhe had endeared himself by his witticisms, honest tongue, and quaint\r\nphilosophy when on the stump, or mingling with them in their homes.\r\n\r\nThe convention, which met in early spring, in the city of Springfield,\r\nwas to be composed of the usual number of delegates. The contest for the\r\nnomination was spirited and exciting.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before the meeting of the convention the fact was found by\r\nthe leaders that the advantage lay with Lincoln, and that unless they\r\npulled some very fine wires nothing could save Baker.\r\n\r\nThey attempted to play the game that has so often won, by “convincing”\r\n delegates under instructions for Lincoln to violate them, and vote for\r\nBaker. They had apparently succeeded.\r\n\r\n“The best laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley.” So it was in this\r\ncase. Two days before the convention Lincoln received an intimation of\r\nthis, and, late at night, wrote the following letter.\r\n\r\nThe letter was addressed to Martin Morris, who resided at Petersburg,\r\nan intimate friend of his, and by him circulated among those who were\r\ninstructed for him at the county convention.\r\n\r\nIt had the desired effect. The convention met, the scheme of the\r\nconspirators miscarried, Lincoln was nominated, made a vigorous canvass,\r\nand was triumphantly elected, thus paving the way for his more extended\r\nand brilliant conquests.\r\n\r\nThis letter, Lincoln had often told his friends, gave him ultimately\r\nthe Chief Magistracy of the nation. He has also said, that, had he been\r\nbeaten before the convention, he would have been forever obscured. The\r\nfollowing is a verbatim copy of the epistle:\r\n\r\n“April 14, 1843.\r\n\r\n“Friend Morris: I have heard it intimated that Baker is trying to get\r\nyou or Miles, or both of you, to violate the instructions of the meeting\r\nthat appointed you, and to go for him. I have insisted, and still\r\ninsist, that this cannot be true.\r\n\r\n“Sure Baker would not do the like. As well might Hardin ask me to vote\r\nfor him in the convention.\r\n\r\n“Again, it is said there will be an attempt to get instructions in your\r\ncounty requiring you to go for Baker. This is all wrong. Upon the same\r\nrule, why might I not fly from the decision against me at Sangamon and\r\nget up instructions to their delegates to go for me. There are at least\r\n1,200 Whigs in the county that took no part, and yet I would as soon\r\nstick my head in the fire as attempt it.\r\n\r\n“Besides, if any one should get the nomination by such extraordinary\r\nmeans, all harmony in the district would inevitably be lost. Honest\r\nWhigs (and very nearly all of them are honest) would not quietly abide\r\nsuch enormities.\r\n\r\n“I repeat, such an attempt on Baker’s part cannot be true. Write me at\r\nSpringfield how the matter is. Don’t show or speak of this letter.\r\n\r\n“A. LINCOLN.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Morris did show the letter, and Mr. Lincoln always thanked his stars\r\nthat he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FAVORITE POEM.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s favorite poem was “Oh! Why Should the Spirit of Mortal Be\r\nProud?” written by William Knox, a Scotchman, although Mr. Lincoln never\r\nknew the author’s name. He once said to a friend:\r\n\r\n“This poem has been a great favorite with me for years. It was first\r\nshown to me, when a young man, by a friend. I afterward saw it and cut\r\nit from a newspaper and learned it by heart. I would give a great deal\r\nto know who wrote it, but I have never been able to ascertain.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?--\r\n    Like a swift-fleeing meteor, a fast-flying cloud,\r\n    A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,\r\n    He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.\r\n\r\n    “The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,\r\n    Be scattered around, and together be laid;\r\n    And the young and the old, and the low and the high,\r\n    Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.\r\n\r\n    “The infant a mother attended and loved;\r\n    The mother, that infant’s affection who proved,\r\n    The husband, that mother and infant who blessed\r\n    --Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.\r\n\r\n    “The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye,\r\n    Shone beauty and pleasure--her triumphs are by;\r\n    And the memory of those who loved her and praised,\r\n    Are alike from the minds of the living erased.\r\n\r\n    “The hand of the king, that the sceptre hath borne,\r\n    The brow of the priest, that the mitre hath worn,\r\n    The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,\r\n    Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.\r\n\r\n    “The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap,\r\n    The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the steep;\r\n    The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,\r\n    Have faded away like the grass that we tread.\r\n\r\n    “The saint, who enjoyed the communion of heaven,\r\n    The sinner, who dared to remain unforgiven;\r\n    The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,\r\n    Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.\r\n\r\n    “So the multitude goes--like the flower or the weed\r\n    That withers away to let others succeed;\r\n    So the multitude comes--even those we behold,\r\n    To repeat every tale that has often been told:\r\n\r\n    “For we are the same our fathers have been;\r\n    We see the same sights our fathers have seen;\r\n    We drink the same stream, we view the same sun,\r\n    And run the same course our fathers have run.\r\n\r\n    “The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would think;\r\n    From the death we are shrinking, our fathers would shrink;\r\n    To the life we are clinging, they also would cling\r\n    --But it speeds from us all like a bird on the wing.\r\n\r\n    “They loved--but the story we cannot unfold;\r\n    They scorned--but the heart of the haughty is cold;\r\n    They grieved--but no wail from their slumber will come;\r\n    They joyed--but the tongue of their gladness is dumb.\r\n\r\n    “They died--aye, they died--and we things that are now,\r\n    That walk on the turf that lies o’er their brow,\r\n    And make in their dwellings a transient abode,\r\n    Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.\r\n\r\n    “Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,\r\n    Are mingled together in sunshine and rain;\r\n    And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,\r\n    Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.\r\n\r\n    “‘Tis the wink of an eye,--‘tis the draught of a breath;\r\n    --From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,\r\n    From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud:\r\n    --Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-LEGGED CALF.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln had great doubt as to his right to emancipate the\r\nslaves under the War power. In discussing the question, he used to like\r\nthe case to that of the boy who, when asked how many legs his calf would\r\nhave if he called its tail a leg, replied, “five,” to which the prompt\r\nresponse was made that calling the tail a leg would not make it a leg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STAGE-COACH STORY.\r\n\r\nThe following is told by Thomas H. Nelson, of Terre Haute, Indiana, who\r\nwas appointed minister to Chili by Lincoln:\r\n\r\nJudge Abram Hammond, afterwards Governor of Indiana, and myself arranged\r\nto go from Terre Haute to Indianapolis in a stage-coach.\r\n\r\nAs we stepped in we discovered that the entire back seat was occupied\r\nby a long, lank individual, whose head seemed to protrude from one end of\r\nthe coach and his feet from the other. He was the sole occupant, and was\r\nsleeping soundly. Hammond slapped him familiarly on the shoulder, and\r\nasked him if he had chartered the coach that day.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” and he at once took the front seat, politely giving\r\nus the place of honor and comfort. An odd-looking fellow he was, with\r\na twenty-five cent hat, without vest or cravat. Regarding him as a good\r\nsubject for merriment, we perpetrated several jokes.\r\n\r\nHe took them all with utmost innocence and good nature, and joined in\r\nthe laugh, although at his own expense.\r\n\r\nAfter an astounding display of wordy pyrotechnics, the dazed and\r\nbewildered stranger asked, “What will be the upshot of this comet\r\nbusiness?”\r\n\r\nLate in the evening we reached Indianapolis, and hurried to Browning’s\r\nhotel, losing sight of the stranger altogether.\r\n\r\nWe retired to our room to brush our clothes. In a few minutes I\r\ndescended to the portico, and there descried our long, gloomy fellow\r\ntraveler in the center of an admiring group of lawyers, among whom were\r\nJudges McLean and Huntington, Albert S. White, and Richard W. Thompson,\r\nwho seemed to be amused and interested in a story he was telling. I\r\ninquired of Browning, the landlord, who he was. “Abraham Lincoln, of\r\nIllinois, a member of Congress,” was his response.\r\n\r\nI was thunderstruck at the announcement. I hastened upstairs and told\r\nHammond the startling news, and together we emerged from the hotel by\r\na back door, and went down an alley to another house, thus avoiding\r\nfurther contact with our distinguished fellow traveler.\r\n\r\nYears afterward, when the President-elect was on his way to Washington,\r\nI was in the same hotel looking over the distinguished party, when a\r\nlong arm reached to my shoulder, and a shrill voice exclaimed, “Hello,\r\nNelson! do you think, after all, the whole world is going to follow the\r\ndarned thing off?” The words were my own in answer to his question in\r\nthe stage-coach. The speaker was Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “400” GATHERED THERE.\r\n\r\nLincoln had periods while “clerking” in the New Salem grocery store\r\nduring which there was nothing for him to do, and was therefore in\r\ncircumstances that made laziness almost inevitable. Had people come to\r\nhim for goods, they would have found him willing to sell them. He sold\r\nall that he could, doubtless.\r\n\r\nThe store soon became the social center of the village. If the people\r\ndid not care (or were unable) to buy goods, they liked to go where they\r\ncould talk with their neighbors and listen to stories. These Lincoln\r\ngave them in abundance, and of a rare sort.\r\n\r\nIt was in these gatherings of the “Four Hundred” at the village store\r\nthat Lincoln got his training as a debater. Public questions were\r\ndiscussed there daily and nightly, and Lincoln always took a prominent\r\npart in the discussions. Many of the debaters came to consider “Abe\r\nLinkin” as about the smartest man in the village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONLY LEVEL-HEADED MEN WANTED.\r\n\r\nLincoln wanted men of level heads for important commands. Not\r\ninfrequently he gave his generals advice.\r\n\r\nHe appreciated Hooker’s bravery, dash and activity, but was fearful of\r\nthe results of what he denominated “swashing around.”\r\n\r\nThis was one of his telegrams to Hooker:\r\n\r\n“And now, beware of rashness; beware of rashness, but, with energy and\r\nsleepless vigilance, go forward and give us victories.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FAITH IN THE MONITOR.\r\n\r\nWhen the Confederate iron-clad Merrimac was sent against the Union\r\nvessels in Hampton Roads President Lincoln expressed his belief in the\r\nMonitor to Captain Fox, the adviser of Captain Ericsson, who constructed\r\nthe Monitor. “We have three of the most effective vessels in Hampton\r\nRoads, and any number of small craft that will hang on the stern of the\r\nMerrimac like small dogs on the haunches of a bear. They may not be\r\nable to tear her down, but they will interfere with the comfort of her\r\nvoyage. Her trial trip will not be a pleasure trip, I am certain.\r\n\r\n“We have had a big share of bad luck already, but I do not believe the\r\nfuture has any such misfortunes in store for us as you anticipate.” Said\r\nCaptain Fox: “If the Merrimac does not sink our ships, who is to prevent\r\nher from dropping her anchor in the Potomac, where that steamer lies,”\r\n pointing to a steamer at anchor below the long bridge, “and throwing her\r\nhundred-pound shells into this room, or battering down the walls of the\r\nCapitol?”\r\n\r\n“The Almighty, Captain,” answered the President, excitedly, but without\r\nthe least affectation. “I expect set-backs, defeats; we have had them\r\nand shall have them. They are common to all wars. But I have not the\r\nslightest fear of any result which shall fatally impair our military\r\nand naval strength, or give other powers any right to interfere in our\r\nquarrel. The destruction of the Capitol would do both.\r\n\r\n“I do not fear it, for this is God’s fight, and He will win it in His\r\nown good time. He will take care that our enemies will not push us too\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n“Speaking of iron-clads,” said the President, “you do not seem to\r\ntake the little Monitor into account. I believe in the Monitor and her\r\ncommander. If Captain Worden does not give a good account of the Monitor\r\nand of himself, I shall have made a mistake in following my judgment for\r\nthe first time since I have been here, Captain.\r\n\r\n“I have not made a mistake in following my clear judgment of men since\r\nthis War began. I followed that judgment when I gave Worden the command\r\nof the Monitor. I would make the appointment over again to-day. The\r\nMonitor should be in Hampton Roads now. She left New York eight days\r\nago.”\r\n\r\nAfter the captain had again presented what he considered the\r\npossibilities of failure the President replied, “No, no, Captain, I\r\nrespect your judgments as you have reason to know, but this time you are\r\nall wrong.\r\n\r\n“The Monitor was one of my inspirations; I believed in her firmly when\r\nthat energetic contractor first showed me Ericsson’s plans. Captain\r\nEricsson’s plain but rather enthusiastic demonstration made my\r\nconversion permanent. It was called a floating battery then; I called\r\nit a raft. I caught some of the inventor’s enthusiasm and it has been\r\ngrowing upon me. I thought then, and I am confident now, it is just what\r\nwe want. I am sure that the Monitor is still afloat, and that she will\r\nyet give a good account of herself. Sometimes I think she may be the\r\nveritable sling with a stone that will yet smite the Merrimac Philistine\r\nin the forehead.”\r\n\r\nSoon was the President’s judgment verified, for the “Fight of the\r\nMonitor and Merrimac” changed all the conditions of naval warfare.\r\n\r\nAfter the victory was gained, the presiding Captain Fox and others went\r\non board the Monitor, and Captain Worden was requested by the President\r\nto narrate the history of the encounter.\r\n\r\nCaptain Worden did so in a modest manner, and apologized for not being\r\nable better to provide for his guests. The President smilingly responded\r\n“Some charitable people say that old Bourbon is an indispensable element\r\nin the fighting qualities of some of our generals in the field, but,\r\nCaptain, after the account that we have heard to-day, no one will say\r\nthat any Dutch courage is needed on board the Monitor.”\r\n\r\n“It never has been, sir,” modestly observed the captain.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fox then gave a description of what he saw of the engagement and\r\ndescribed it as indescribably grand. Then, turning to the President, he\r\ncontinued, “Now standing here on the deck of this battle-scarred\r\nvessel, the first genuine iron-clad--the victor in the first fight\r\nof iron-clads--let me make a confession, and perform an act of simple\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n“I never fully believed in armored vessels until I saw this battle.\r\n\r\n“I know all the facts which united to give us the Monitor. I withhold no\r\ncredit from Captain Ericsson, her inventor, but I know that the country\r\nis principally indebted for the construction of the vessel to President\r\nLincoln, and for the success of her trial to Captain Worden, her\r\ncommander.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHER ONLY IMPERFECTION.\r\n\r\nAt one time a certain Major Hill charged Lincoln with making defamatory\r\nremarks regarding Mrs. Hill.\r\n\r\nHill was insulting in his language to Lincoln who never lost his temper.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw his chance to edge a word in, Lincoln denied emphatically\r\nusing the language or anything like that attributed to him.\r\n\r\nHe entertained, he insisted, a high regard for Mrs. Hill, and the only\r\nthing he knew to her discredit was the fact that she was Major Hill’s\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD LADY’S PROPHECY.\r\n\r\nAmong those who called to congratulate Mr. Lincoln upon his nomination\r\nfor President was an old lady, very plainly dressed. She knew Mr.\r\nLincoln, but Mr. Lincoln did not at first recognize her. Then she\r\nundertook to recall to his memory certain incidents connected with his\r\nride upon the circuit--especially his dining at her house upon the road\r\nat different times. Then he remembered her and her home.\r\n\r\nHaving fixed her own place in his recollection, she tried to recall to\r\nhim a certain scanty dinner of bread and milk that he once ate at her\r\nhouse. He could not remember it--on the contrary, he only remembered\r\nthat he had always fared well at her house.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, “one day you came along after we had got through\r\ndinner, and we had eaten up everything, and I could give you nothing but\r\na bowl of bread and milk, and you ate it; and when you got up you said\r\nit was good enough for the President of the United States!”\r\n\r\nThe good woman had come in from the country, making a journey of eight\r\nor ten miles, to relate to Mr. Lincoln this incident, which, in her\r\nmind, had doubtless taken the form of a prophecy. Mr. Lincoln placed\r\nthe honest creature at her ease, chatted with her of old times, and\r\ndismissed her in the most happy frame of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE TOWN OF LINCOLN, ILL., WAS NAMED.\r\n\r\nThe story of naming the town of Lincoln, the county seat of Logan\r\ncounty, Illinois, is thus given on good authority:\r\n\r\nThe first railroad had been built through the county, and a station\r\nwas about to be located there. Lincoln, Virgil Hitchcock, Colonel R.\r\nB. Latham and several others were sitting on a pile of ties and talking\r\nabout moving a county seat from Mount Pulaski. Mr. Lincoln rose and\r\nstarted to walk away, when Colonel Latham said: “Lincoln, if you will\r\nhelp us to get the county seat here, we will call the place Lincoln.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Latham,” he replied.\r\n\r\nColonel Latham then deeded him a lot on the west side of the courthouse,\r\nand he owned it at the time he was elected President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“OLD JEFF’S” BIG NIGHTMARE.\r\n\r\n“Jeff” Davis had a large and threatening nightmare in November, 1864,\r\nand what he saw in his troubled dreams was the long and lanky figure of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, who had just been endorsed by the people of the United\r\nStates for another term in the White House at Washington. The cartoon\r\nreproduced here is from the issue of “Frank Leslie’s Illustrated\r\nNewspaper” of December 3rd, 1864, it being entitled “Jeff Davis’\r\nNovember Nightmare.”\r\n\r\nDavis had been told that McClellan, “the War is a failure” candidate for\r\nthe Presidency, would have no difficulty whatever in defeating Lincoln;\r\nthat negotiations with the Confederate officials for the cessation of\r\nhostilities would be entered into as soon as McClellan was seated in the\r\nChief Executive’s chair; that the Confederacy would, in all probability,\r\nbe recognized as an independent government by the Washington\r\nAdministration; that the “sacred institution” of slavery would continue\r\nto do business at the old stand; that the Confederacy would be one of\r\nthe great nations of the world, and have all the “State Rights” and\r\nother things it wanted, with absolutely no interference whatever upon\r\nthe part of the North.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Lincoln’s re-election was a rough, rude shock to Davis, who\r\nhad not prepared himself for such an event. Six months from the date of\r\nthat nightmare-dream he was a prisoner in the hands of the Union forces,\r\nand the Confederacy was a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S LAST OFFICIAL ACT.\r\n\r\nProbably the last official act of President Lincoln’s life was the\r\nsigning of the commission reappointing Alvin Saunders Governor of\r\nNebraska.\r\n\r\n“I saw Mr. Lincoln regarding the matter,” said Governor Saunders, “and\r\nhe told me to go home; that he would attend to it all right. I left\r\nWashington on the morning of the 14th, and while en route the news\r\nof the assassination on the evening of the same day reached me. I\r\nimmediately wired back to find out what had become of my commission,\r\nand was told that the room had not been opened. When it was opened, the\r\ndocument was found lying on the desk.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln signed it just before leaving for the theater that fatal\r\nevening, and left it lying there, unfolded.\r\n\r\n“A note was found below the document as follows: ‘Rather a lengthy\r\ncommission, bestowing upon Mr. Alvin Saunders the official authority of\r\nGovernor of the Territory of Nebraska.’ Then came Lincoln’s signature,\r\nwhich, with one exception, that of a penciled message on the back of a\r\ncard sent up by a friend as Mr. Lincoln was dressing for the theater,\r\nwas the very last signature of the martyred President.”\r\n\r\nTHE LAD NEEDED THE SLEEP.\r\n\r\nA personal friend of President Lincoln is authority for this:\r\n\r\n“I called on him one day in the early part of the War. He had just\r\nwritten a pardon for a young man who had been sentenced to be shot for\r\nsleeping at his post. He remarked as he read it to me:\r\n\r\n“‘I could not think of going into eternity with the blood of the poor\r\nyoung man on my skirts.’ Then he added:\r\n\r\n“‘It is not to be wondered at that a boy, raised on a farm, probably in\r\nthe habit of going to bed at dark, should, when required to watch, fall\r\nasleep; and I cannot consent to shoot him for such an act.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MASSA LINKUM LIKE DE LORD!”\r\n\r\nBy the Act of Emancipation President Lincoln built for himself forever\r\nthe first place in the affections of the African race in this country.\r\nThe love and reverence manifested for him by many of these people has,\r\non some occasions, almost reached adoration. One day Colonel McKaye, of\r\nNew York, who had been one of a committee to investigate the condition\r\nof the freedmen, upon his return from Hilton Head and Beaufort called\r\nupon the President, and in the course of the interview said that up to\r\nthe time of the arrival among them in the South of the Union forces\r\nthey had no knowledge of any other power. Their masters fled upon the\r\napproach of our soldiers, and this gave the slaves the conception of\r\na power greater than their masters exercised. This power they called\r\n“Massa Linkum.”\r\n\r\nColonel McKaye said their place of worship was a large building they\r\ncalled “the praise house,” and the leader of the “meeting,” a venerable\r\nblack man, was known as “the praise man.”\r\n\r\nOn a certain day, when there was quite a large gathering of the people,\r\nconsiderable confusion was created by different persons attempting to\r\ntell who and what “Massa Linkum” was. In the midst of the excitement the\r\nwhite-headed leader commanded silence. “Brederen,” said he, “you don’t\r\nknow nosen’ what you’se talkin’ ‘bout. Now, you just listen to me. Massa\r\nLinkum, he ebery whar. He know ebery ting.”\r\n\r\nThen, solemnly looking up, he added: “He walk de earf like de Lord!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LINCOLN TOOK THE NEWS.\r\n\r\nOne of Lincoln’s most dearly loved friends, United States Senator Edward\r\nD. Baker, of Oregon, Colonel of the Seventy-first Pennsylvania, a former\r\ntownsman of Mr. Lincoln, was killed at the battle of Ball’s Bluff, in\r\nOctober, 1861. The President went to General McClellan’s headquarters to\r\nhear the news, and a friend thus described the effect it had upon him:\r\n\r\n“We could hear the click of the telegraph in the adjoining room and low\r\nconversation between the President and General McClellan, succeeded by\r\nsilence, excepting the click, click of the instrument, which went on\r\nwith its tale of disaster.\r\n\r\n“Five minutes passed, and then Mr. Lincoln, unattended, with bowed head\r\nand tears rolling down his furrowed cheeks, his face pale and wan, his\r\nbreast heaving with emotion, passed through the room. He almost fell as\r\nhe stepped into the street. We sprang involuntarily from our seats to\r\nrender assistance, but he did not fall.\r\n\r\n“With both hands pressed upon his heart, he walked down the street, not\r\nreturning the salute of the sentinel pacing his beat before the door.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFANITY AS A SAFETY-VALVE.\r\n\r\nLincoln never indulged in profanity, but confessed that when Lee was\r\nbeaten at Malvern Hill, after seven days of fighting, and Richmond,\r\nbut twelve miles away, was at McClellan’s mercy, he felt very much\r\nlike swearing when he learned that the Union general had retired to\r\nHarrison’s Landing.\r\n\r\nLee was so confident his opponent would not go to Richmond that he took\r\nhis army into Maryland--a move he would not have made had an energetic\r\nfighting man been in McClellan’s place.\r\n\r\nIt is true McClellan followed and defeated Lee in the bloodiest battle\r\nof the War--Antietam--afterwards following him into Virginia; but\r\nLincoln could not bring himself to forgive the general’s inaction before\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY WE WON AT GETTYSBURG.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln said to General Sickles, just after the victory\r\nof Gettysburg: “The fact is, General, in the stress and pinch of the\r\ncampaign there, I went to my room, and got down on my knees and prayed\r\nGod Almighty for victory at Gettysburg. I told Him that this was His\r\ncountry, and the war was His war, but that we really couldn’t stand\r\nanother Fredericksburg or Chancellorsville. And then and there I made\r\na solemn vow with my Maker that if He would stand by you boys at\r\nGettysburg I would stand by Him. And He did, and I will! And after this\r\nI felt that God Almighty had taken the whole thing into His hands.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAD TO WAIT FOR HIM.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, having arranged to go to New York, was late for his\r\ntrain, much to the disgust of those who were to accompany him, and all\r\nwere compelled to wait several hours until the next train steamed out\r\nof the station. President Lincoln was much amused at the dissatisfaction\r\ndisplayed, and then ventured the remark that the situation reminded him\r\nof “a little story.” Said he:\r\n\r\n“Out in Illinois, a convict who had murdered his cellmate was sentenced\r\nto be hanged. On the day set for the execution, crowds lined the roads\r\nleading to the spot where the scaffold had been erected, and there was\r\nmuch jostling and excitement. The condemned man took matters coolly, and\r\nas one batch of perspiring, anxious men rushed past the cart in which he\r\nwas riding, he called out, ‘Don’t be in a hurry, boys. You’ve got plenty\r\nof time. There won’t be any fun until I get there.’\r\n\r\n“That’s the condition of things now,” concluded the President; “there\r\nwon’t be any fun at New York until I get there.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT AND CABINET JOINED IN PRAYER.\r\n\r\nOn the day the news of General Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court-House\r\nwas received, so an intimate friend of President Lincoln relates,\r\nthe Cabinet meeting was held an hour earlier than usual. Neither the\r\nPresident nor any member of the Cabinet was able, for a time, to give\r\nutterance to his feelings. At the suggestion of Mr. Lincoln all dropped\r\non their knees, and offered, in silence and in tears, their humble and\r\nheartfelt acknowledgments to the Almighty for the triumph He had granted\r\nto the National cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELIEVED HE WAS A CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was much impressed with the devotion and earnestness of\r\npurpose manifested by a certain lady of the “Christian Commission”\r\n during the War, and on one occasion, after she had discharged the object\r\nof her visit, said to her:\r\n\r\n“Madam, I have formed a high opinion of your Christian character, and\r\nnow, as we are alone, I have a mind to ask you to give me in brief your\r\nidea of what constitutes a true religious experience.”\r\n\r\nThe lady replied at some length, stating that, in her judgment, it\r\nconsisted of a conviction of one’s own sinfulness and weakness, and a\r\npersonal need of the Saviour for strength and support; that views of\r\nmere doctrine might and would differ, but when one was really brought to\r\nfeel his need of divine help, and to seek the aid of the Holy Spirit for\r\nstrength and guidance, it was satisfactory evidence of his having been\r\nborn again. This was the substance of her reply.\r\n\r\nWhen she had, concluded Mr. Lincoln was very thoughtful for a few\r\nmoments. He at length said, very earnestly: “If what you have told me\r\nis really a correct view of this great subject I think I can say with\r\nsincerity that I hope I am a Christian. I had lived,” he continued,\r\n“until my boy Willie died without fully realizing these things. That\r\nblow overwhelmed me. It showed me my weakness as I had never felt it\r\nbefore, and if I can take what you have stated as a test I think I can\r\nsafely say that I know something of that change of which you speak; and\r\nI will further add that it has been my intention for some time, at a\r\nsuitable opportunity, to make a public religious profession.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE HELP OF GOD.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln once remarked to Mr. Noah Brooks, one of his most intimate\r\npersonal friends: “I should be the most presumptuous blockhead upon this\r\nfootstool if I for one day thought that I could discharge the duties\r\nwhich have come upon me, since I came to this place, without the aid and\r\nenlightenment of One who is stronger and wiser than all others.”\r\n\r\nHe said on another occasion: “I am very sure that if I do not go away\r\nfrom here a wiser man, I shall go away a better man, from having learned\r\nhere what a very poor sort of a man I am.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNED TEARS TO SMILES.\r\n\r\nOne night Schuyler Colfax left all other business to go to the White\r\nHouse to ask the President to respite the son of a constituent, who was\r\nsentenced to be shot, at Davenport, for desertion. Mr. Lincoln heard the\r\nstory with his usual patience, though he was wearied out with incessant\r\ncalls, and anxious for rest, and then replied:\r\n\r\n“Some of our generals complain that I impair discipline and\r\nsubordination in the army by my pardons and respites, but it makes me\r\nrested, after a hard day’s work, if I can find some good excuse for\r\nsaving a man’s life, and I go to bed happy as I think how joyous the\r\nsigning of my name will make him and his family and his friends.”\r\n\r\nAnd with a happy smile beaming over that care-furrowed face, he signed\r\nthat name that saved that life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S LAST WRITTEN WORDS.\r\n\r\nAs the President and Mrs. Lincoln were leaving the White House, a\r\nfew minutes before eight o’clock, on the evening of April 14th, 1865,\r\nLincoln wrote this note:\r\n\r\n“Allow Mr. Ashmun and friend to come to see me at 9 o’clock a. m.,\r\nto-morrow, April 15th, 1865.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMEN PLEAD FOR PARDONS.\r\n\r\nOne day during the War an attractively and handsomely dressed woman\r\ncalled on President Lincoln to procure the release from prison of a\r\nrelation in whom she professed the deepest interest.\r\n\r\nShe was a good talker, and her winning ways seemed to make a deep\r\nimpression on the President. After listening to her story, he wrote a\r\nfew words on a card: “This woman, dear Stanton, is a little smarter than\r\nshe looks to be,” enclosed it in an envelope and directed her to take it\r\nto the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nOn the same day another woman called, more humble in appearance, more\r\nplainly clad. It was the old story.\r\n\r\nFather and son both in the army, the former in prison. Could not the\r\nlatter be discharged from the army and sent home to help his mother?\r\n\r\nA few strokes of the pen, a gentle nod of the head, and the little\r\nwoman, her eyes filling with tears and expressing a grateful\r\nacknowledgment her tongue, could not utter, passed out.\r\n\r\nA lady so thankful for the release of her husband was in the act of\r\nkneeling in thankfulness. “Get up,” he said, “don’t kneel to me, but\r\nthank God and go.”\r\n\r\nAn old lady for the same reason came forward with tears in her eyes\r\nto express her gratitude. “Good-bye, Mr. Lincoln,” said she; “I shall\r\nprobably never see you again till we meet in heaven.” She had the\r\nPresident’s hand in hers, and he was deeply moved. He instantly took her\r\nright hand in both of his, and, following her to the door, said, “I am\r\nafraid with all my troubles I shall never get to the resting-place you\r\nspeak of; but if I do, I am sure I shall find you. That you wish me to\r\nget there is, I believe, the best wish you could make for me. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nThen the President remarked to a friend, “It is more than many can\r\noften say, that in doing right one has made two people happy in one day.\r\nSpeed, die when I may, I want it said of me by those who know me best,\r\nthat I have always plucked a thistle and planted a flower when I thought\r\na flower would grow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN WISHED TO SEE RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nThe President remarked to Admiral David D. Porter, while on board the\r\nflagship Malvern, on the James River, in front of Richmond, the day the\r\ncity surrendered:\r\n\r\n“Thank God that I have lived to see this!\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that I have been dreaming a horrid dream for four years,\r\nand now the nightmare is gone.\r\n\r\n“I wish to see Richmond.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOKEN LIKE A CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\nFrederick Douglass told, in these words, of his first interview with\r\nPresident Lincoln:\r\n\r\n“I approached him with trepidation as to how this great man might\r\nreceive me; but one word and look from him banished all my fears and set\r\nme perfectly at ease. I have often said since that meeting that it was\r\nmuch easier to see and converse with a great man than it was with a\r\nsmall man.\r\n\r\n“On that occasion he said:\r\n\r\n“‘Douglass, you need not tell me who you are. Mr. Seward has told me all\r\nabout you.’\r\n\r\n“I then saw that there was no reason to tell him my personal story,\r\nhowever interesting it might be to myself or others, so I told him at\r\nonce the object of my visit. It was to get some expression from him upon\r\nthree points:\r\n\r\n“1. Equal pay to colored soldiers.\r\n\r\n“2. Their promotion when they had earned it on the battle-field.\r\n\r\n“3. Should they be taken prisoners and enslaved or hanged, as Jefferson\r\nDavis had threatened, an equal number of Confederate prisoners should be\r\nexecuted within our lines.\r\n\r\n“A declaration to that effect I thought would prevent the execution of\r\nthe rebel threat. To all but the last, President Lincoln assented. He\r\nargued, however, that neither equal pay nor promotion could be granted\r\nat once. He said that in view of existing prejudices it was a great step\r\nforward to employ colored troops at all; that it was necessary to avoid\r\neverything that would offend this prejudice and increase opposition to\r\nthe measure.\r\n\r\n“He detailed the steps by which white soldiers were reconciled to the\r\nemployment of colored troops; how these were first employed as laborers;\r\nhow it was thought they should not be armed or uniformed like white\r\nsoldiers; how they should only be made to wear a peculiar uniform; how\r\nthey should be employed to hold forts and arsenals in sickly locations,\r\nand not enter the field like other soldiers.\r\n\r\n“With all these restrictions and limitations he easily made me see that\r\nmuch would be gained when the colored man loomed before the country as a\r\nfull-fledged United States soldier to fight, flourish or fall in defense\r\nof the united republic. The great soul of Lincoln halted only when he\r\ncame to the point of retaliation.\r\n\r\n“The thought of hanging men in cold blood, even though the rebels\r\nshould murder a few of the colored prisoners, was a horror from which he\r\nshrank.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, Douglass! I cannot do that. If I could get hold of the actual\r\nmurderers of colored prisoners I would retaliate; but to hang those who\r\nhave no hand in such murders, I cannot.’\r\n\r\n“The contemplation of such an act brought to his countenance such an\r\nexpression of sadness and pity that it made it hard for me to press my\r\npoint, though I told him it would tend to save rather than destroy life.\r\nHe, however, insisted that this work of blood, once begun, would be hard\r\nto stop--that such violence would beget violence. He argued more like a\r\ndisciple of Christ than a commander-in-chief of the army and navy of a\r\nwarlike nation already involved in a terrible war.\r\n\r\n“How sad and strange the fate of this great and good man, the saviour\r\nof his country, the embodiment of human charity, whose heart, though\r\nstrong, was as tender as a heart of childhood; who always tempered\r\njustice with mercy; who sought to supplant the sword with counsel of\r\nreason, to suppress passion by kindness and moderation; who had a sigh\r\nfor every human grief and a tear for every human woe, should at last\r\nperish by the hand of a desperate assassin, against whom no thought of\r\nmalice had ever entered his heart!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“LINCOLN GOES IN WHEN THE QUAKERS ARE OUT”\r\n\r\nOne of the campaign songs of 1860 which will never be forgotten was\r\nWhittier’s “The Quakers Are Out:--”\r\n\r\n     “Give the flags to the winds!\r\n       Set the hills all aflame!\r\n     Make way for the man with\r\n       The Patriarch’s name!\r\n     Away with misgivings--away\r\n       With all doubt,\r\n     For Lincoln goes in when the\r\n       Quakers are out!”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this song (with which he was greatly pleased) one day at\r\nthe White House, the President said: “It reminds me of a little story\r\nI heard years ago out in Illinois. A political campaign was on, and the\r\natmosphere was kept at a high temperature. Several fights had already\r\noccurred, many men having been seriously hurt, and the prospects were\r\nthat the result would be close. One of the candidates was a professional\r\npolitician with a huge wart on his nose, this disfigurement having\r\nearned for him the nickname of ‘Warty.’ His opponent was a young lawyer\r\nwho wore ‘biled’ shirts, ‘was shaved by a barber, and had his clothes\r\nmade to fit him.\r\n\r\n“Now, ‘Warty’ was of Quaker stock, and around election time made a great\r\nparade of the fact. When there were no campaigns in progress he was\r\nanything but Quakerish in his language or actions. The young lawyer\r\ndidn’t know what the inside of a meeting house looked like.\r\n\r\n“Well, the night before election-day the two candidates came together at\r\na joint debate, both being on the speakers’ platform. The young lawyer\r\nhad to speak after ‘Warty,’ and his reputation suffered at the hands of\r\nthe Quaker, who told the many Friends present what a wicked fellow the\r\nyoung man was--never went to church, swore, drank, smoked and gambled.\r\n\r\n“After ‘Warty’ had finished the other arose and faced the audience. ‘I’m\r\nnot a good man,’ said he, ‘and what my opponent has said about me is\r\ntrue enough, but I’m always the same. I don’t profess religion when I\r\nrun for office, and then turn around and associate with bad people when\r\nthe campaign’s over. I’m no hypocrite. I don’t sing many psalms. Neither\r\ndoes my opponent; and, talking about singing, I’d just like to hear my\r\nfriend who is running against me sing the song--for the benefit of this\r\naudience--I heard him sing the night after he was nominated. I yield the\r\nfloor to him:\r\n\r\n“Of course ‘Warty’ refused, his Quaker supporters grew suspicious, and\r\nwhen they turned out at the polls the following day they voted for the\r\nwicked young lawyer.\r\n\r\n“So, it’s true that when ‘the Quakers are out’ the man they support is\r\napt to go in.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAD CONFIDENCE IN HIM--“BUT--.”\r\n\r\n“General Blank asks for more men,” said Secretary of War Stanton to\r\nthe President one day, showing the latter a telegram from the commander\r\nnamed appealing for re-enforcements.\r\n\r\n“I guess he’s killed off enough men, hasn’t he?” queried the President.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean Confederates--our own men. What’s the use in sending\r\nvolunteers down to him if they’re only used to fill graves?”\r\n\r\n“His dispatch seems to imply that, in his opinion, you have not the\r\nconfidence in him he thinks he deserves,” the War Secretary went on to\r\nsay, as he looked over the telegram again.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” was the President’s reply, “he needn’t lose any of his sleep on\r\nthat account. Just telegraph him to that effect; also, that I don’t\r\npropose to send him any more men.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HOMINY WAS ORIGINATED.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of a Cabinet meeting the subject of food for the men\r\nin the Army happened to come up. From that the conversation changed to\r\nthe study of the Latin language.\r\n\r\n“I studied Latin once,” said Mr. Lincoln, in a casual way.\r\n\r\n“Were you interested in it?” asked Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes. I saw some very curious things,” was the President’s\r\nrejoinder.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Secretary Seward.\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s the word hominy, for instance. We have just ordered a lot\r\nof that stuff for the troops. I see how the word originated. I notice it\r\ncame from the Latin word homo--a man.\r\n\r\n“When we decline homo, it is:\r\n\r\n“‘Homo--a man.\r\n\r\n“‘Hominis--of man.\r\n\r\n“‘Homini--for man.’\r\n\r\n“So you see, hominy, being ‘for man,’ comes from the Latin. I guess\r\nthose soldiers who don’t know Latin will get along with it all\r\nright--though I won’t rest real easy until I hear from the Commissary\r\nDepartment on it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS IDEA’S OLD, AFTER ALL.\r\n\r\nOne day, while listening to one of the wise men who had called at the\r\nWhite House to unload a large cargo of advice, the President interjected\r\na remark to the effect that he had a great reverence for learning.\r\n\r\n“This is not,” President Lincoln explained, “because I am not an\r\neducated man. I feel the need of reading. It is a loss to a man not to\r\nhave grown up among books.”\r\n\r\n“Men of force,” the visitor answered, “can get on pretty well without\r\nbooks. They do their own thinking instead of adopting what other men\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Lincoln, “but books serve to show a man that those\r\noriginal thoughts of his aren’t very new, after all.”\r\n\r\nThis was a point the caller was not willing to debate, and so he cut his\r\ncall short.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN’S FIRST SPEECH.\r\n\r\nLincoln made his first speech when he was a mere boy, going barefoot,\r\nhis trousers held up by one suspender, and his shock of hair sticking\r\nthrough a hole in the crown of his cheap straw hat.\r\n\r\n“Abe,” in company with Dennis Hanks, attended a political meeting,\r\nwhich was addressed by a typical stump speaker--one of those loud-voiced\r\nfellows who shouted at the top of his voice and waved his arms wildly.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the speech, which did not meet the views either\r\nof “Abe” or Dennis, the latter declared that “Abe” could make a better\r\nspeech than that. Whereupon he got a dry-goods box and called on “Abe”\r\n to reply to the campaign orator.\r\n\r\nLincoln threw his old straw hat on the ground, and, mounting the\r\ndry-goods box, delivered a speech which held the attention of the crowd\r\nand won him considerable applause. Even the campaign orator admitted\r\nthat it was a fine speech and answered every point in his own “oration.”\r\n\r\nDennis Hanks, who thought “Abe” was about the greatest man that ever\r\nlived, was delighted, and he often told how young “Abe” got the better\r\nof the trained campaign speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ABE WANTED NO SNEAKIN’ ‘ROUND.”\r\n\r\nIt was in 1830, when “Abe” was just twenty-one years of age, that\r\nthe Lincoln family moved from Gentryville, Indiana, to near Decatur,\r\nIllinois, their household goods being packed in a wagon drawn by four\r\noxen driven by “Abe.”\r\n\r\nThe winter previous the latter had “worked” in a country store in\r\nGentryville and before undertaking the journey he invested all the money\r\nhe had--some thirty dollars--in notions, such as needles, pins, thread,\r\nbuttons and other domestic necessities. These he sold to families along\r\nthe route and made a profit of about one hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nThis mercantile adventure of his youth “reminded” the President of a\r\nvery clever story while the members of the Cabinet were one day solemnly\r\ndebating a rather serious international problem. The President was in\r\nthe minority, as was frequently the case, and he was “in a hole,” as\r\nhe afterwards expressed it. He didn’t want to argue the points raised,\r\npreferring to settle the matter in a hurry, and an apt story was his\r\nonly salvation.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the President’s fact brightened. “Gentlemen,” said he,\r\naddressing those seated at the Cabinet table, “the situation just now\r\nreminds me of a fix I got into some thirty years or so ago when I was\r\npeddling ‘notions’ on the way from Indiana to Illinois. I didn’t have a\r\nlarge stock, but I charged large prices, and I made money. Perhaps you\r\ndon’t see what I am driving at?”\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Seward was wearing a most gloomy expression of\r\ncountenance; Secretary of War Stanton was savage and inclined to be\r\nmorose; Secretary of the Treasury Chase was indifferent and cynical,\r\nwhile the others of the Presidential advisers resigned themselves to the\r\nhearing of the inevitable “story.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t propose to argue this matter,” the President went on to say,\r\n“because arguments have no effect upon men whose opinions are fixed and\r\nwhose minds are made up. But this little story of mine will make some\r\nthings which now are in the dark show up more clearly.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause, and the Cabinet officers, maintaining their\r\nprevious silence, began wondering if the President himself really knew\r\nwhat he was “driving at.”\r\n\r\n“Just before we left Indiana and crossed into Illinois,” continued Mr.\r\nLincoln solemnly, speaking in a grave tone of voice, “we came across a\r\nsmall farmhouse full of nothing but children. These ranged in years from\r\nseventeen years to seventeen months, and all were in tears. The mother\r\nof the family was red-headed and red-faced, and the whip she held in her\r\nright hand led to the inference that she had been chastising her brood.\r\nThe father of the family, a meek-looking, mild-mannered, tow-headed\r\nchap, was standing in the front door-way, awaiting--to all\r\nappearances--his turn to feel the thong.\r\n\r\n“I thought there wasn’t much use in asking the head of that house if she\r\nwanted any ‘notions.’ She was too busy. It was evident an insurrection\r\nhad been in progress, but it was pretty well quelled when I got there.\r\nThe mother had about suppressed it with an iron hand, but she was not\r\nrunning any risks. She kept a keen and wary eye upon all the children,\r\nnot forgetting an occasional glance at the ‘old man’ in the doorway.\r\n\r\n“She saw me as I came up, and from her look I thought she was of the\r\nopinion that I intended to interfere. Advancing to the doorway, and\r\nroughly pushing her husband aside, she demanded my business.\r\n\r\n“‘Nothing, madame,’ I answered as gently as possible; ‘I merely dropped\r\nin as I came along to see how things were going.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, you needn’t wait,’ was the reply in an irritated way; ‘there’s\r\ntrouble here, an’ lots of it, too, but I kin manage my own affairs\r\nwithout the help of outsiders. This is jest a family row, but I’ll teach\r\nthese brats their places ef I hev to lick the hide off ev’ry one of\r\nthem. I don’t do much talkin’, but I run this house, an’ I don’t want no\r\none sneakin’ round tryin’ to find out how I do it, either.’\r\n\r\n“That’s the case here with us,” the President said in conclusion. “We\r\nmust let the other nations know that we propose to settle our family\r\nrow in our own way, and ‘teach these brats their places’ (the seceding\r\nStates) if we have to ‘lick the hide off’ of each and every one of them.\r\nAnd, like the old woman, we don’t want any ‘sneakin’ ‘round’ by other\r\ncountries who would like to find out how we are to do it, either.\r\n\r\n“Now, Seward, you write some diplomatic notes to that effect.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Cabinet session closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDN’T EVEN NEED STILTS.\r\n\r\nAs the President considered it his duty to keep in touch with all the\r\nimprovements in the armament of the vessels belonging to the United\r\nStates Navy, he was necessarily interested in the various types of these\r\nfloating fortresses. Not only was it required of the Navy Department to\r\nfurnish seagoing warships, deep-draught vessels for the great rivers and\r\nthe lakes, but this Department also found use for little gunboats which\r\ncould creep along in the shallowest of water and attack the Confederates\r\nin by-places and swamps.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of the interest taken by Mr. Lincoln in the Navy was\r\nthat he was besieged, day and night, by steamboat contractors, each one\r\neager to sell his product to the Washington Government. All sorts of\r\nexperiments were tried, some being dire failures, while others were more\r\nthan fairly successful. More than once had these tiny war vessels proved\r\nthemselves of great service, and the United States Government had a\r\nlarge number of them built.\r\n\r\nThere was one particular contractor who bothered the President more\r\nthan all the others put together. He was constantly impressing upon Mr.\r\nLincoln the great superiority of his boats, because they would run in\r\nsuch shallow water.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” replied the President, “I’ve no doubt they’ll run anywhere\r\nwhere the ground is a little moist!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“HOW DO YOU GET OUT OF THIS PLACE?”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” remarked the President one day while reading, over\r\nsome of the appealing telegrams sent to the War Department by General\r\nMcClellan, “that McClellan has been wandering around and has sort of\r\ngot lost. He’s been hollering for help ever since he went South--wants\r\nsomebody to come to his deliverance and get him out of the place he’s\r\ngot into.\r\n\r\n“He reminds me of the story of a man out in Illinois who, in company\r\nwith a number of friends, visited the State penitentiary. They wandered\r\nall through the institution and saw everything, but just about the time\r\nto depart this particular man became separated from his friends and\r\ncouldn’t find his way out.\r\n\r\n“He roamed up and down one corridor after another, becoming more\r\ndesperate all the time, when, at last, he came across a convict who was\r\nlooking out from between the bars of his cell-door. Here was salvation\r\nat last. Hurrying up to the prisoner he hastily asked,\r\n\r\n“‘Say! How do you get out of this place?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“TAD” INTRODUCES “OUR FRIENDS.”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln often avoided interviews with delegations representing\r\nvarious States, especially when he knew the objects of their errands,\r\nand was aware he could not grant their requests. This was the case with\r\nseveral commissioners from Kentucky, who were put off from day to day.\r\n\r\nThey were about to give up in despair, and were leaving the White House\r\nlobby, their speech being interspersed with vehement and uncomplimentary\r\nterms concerning “Old Abe,” when “Tad” happened along. He caught at\r\nthese words, and asked one of them if they wanted to see “Old Abe,”\r\n laughing at the same time.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute,” said “Tad,” and rushed into his father’s office. Said\r\nhe, “Papa, may I introduce some friends to you?”\r\n\r\nHis father, always indulgent and ready to make him happy, kindly said,\r\n“Yes, my son, I will see your friends.”\r\n\r\n“Tad” went to the Kentuckians again, and asked a very dignified looking\r\ngentleman of the party his name. He was told his name. He then said,\r\n“Come, gentlemen,” and they followed him.\r\n\r\nLeading them up to the President, “Tad,” with much dignity, said, “Papa,\r\nlet me introduce to you Judge ----, of Kentucky;” and quickly added,\r\n“Now Judge, you introduce the other gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nThe introductions were gone through with, and they turned out to be the\r\ngentlemen Mr. Lincoln had been avoiding for a week. Mr. Lincoln reached\r\nfor the boy, took him in his lap, kissed him, and told him it was all\r\nright, and that he had introduced his friend like a little gentleman as\r\nhe was. Tad was eleven years old at this time.\r\n\r\nThe President was pleased with Tad’s diplomacy, and often laughed at the\r\nincident as he told others of it. One day while caressing the boy, he\r\nasked him why he called those gentlemen “his friends.” “Well,” said Tad,\r\n“I had seen them so often, and they looked so good and sorry, and said\r\nthey were from Kentucky, that I thought they must be our friends.” “That\r\nis right, my son,” said Mr. Lincoln; “I would have the whole human race\r\nyour friends and mine, if it were possible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXED UP WORSE THAN BEFORE.\r\n\r\nThe President told a story which most beautifully illustrated the\r\nmuddled situation of affairs at the time McClellan’s fate was hanging in\r\nthe balance. McClellan’s work was not satisfactory, but the President\r\nhesitated to remove him; the general was so slow that the Confederates\r\nmarched all around him; and, to add to the dilemma, the President could\r\nnot find a suitable man to take McClellan’s place.\r\n\r\nThe latter was a political, as well as a military, factor; his friends\r\nthreatened that, if he was removed, many war Democrats would cast their\r\ninfluence with the South, etc. It was, altogether, a sad mix-up, and\r\nthe President, for a time, was at his wits’ end. He was assailed on all\r\nsides with advice, but none of it was worth acting upon.\r\n\r\n“This situation reminds me,” said the President at a Cabinet meeting one\r\nday not long before the appointment of General Halleck as McClellan’s\r\nsuccessor in command of the Union forces, “of a Union man in Kentucky\r\nwhose two sons enlisted in the Federal Army. His wife was of Confederate\r\nsympathies. His nearest neighbor was a Confederate in feeling, and his\r\ntwo sons were fighting under Lee. This neighbor’s wife was a Union woman\r\nand it nearly broke her heart to know that her sons were arrayed against\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n“Finally, the two men, after each had talked the matter over with his\r\nwife, agreed to obtain divorces; this they, did, and the Union man and\r\nUnion woman were wedded, as were the Confederate man and the Confederate\r\nwoman--the men swapped wives, in short. But this didn’t seem to help\r\nmatters any, for the sons of the Union woman were still fighting for the\r\nSouth, and the sons of the Confederate woman continued in the Federal\r\nArmy; the Union husband couldn’t get along with his Union wife, and\r\nthe Confederate husband and his Confederate wife couldn’t agree upon\r\nanything, being forever fussing and quarreling.\r\n\r\n“It’s the same thing with the Army. It doesn’t seem worth while to\r\nsecure divorces and then marry the Army and McClellan to others, for\r\nthey won’t get along any better than they do now, and there’ll only be a\r\nnew set of heartaches started. I think we’d better wait; perhaps a real\r\nfighting general will come along some of these days, and then we’ll\r\nall be happy. If you go to mixing in a mix-up, you only make the muddle\r\nworse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“LONG ABE’S” FEET “PROTRUDED OVER.”\r\n\r\nGeorge M. Pullman, the great sleeping-car builder, once told a joke in\r\nwhich Lincoln was the prominent figure. In fact, there wouldn’t have\r\nbeen any joke had it not been for “Long Abe.” At the time of the\r\noccurrence, which was the foundation for the joke--and Pullman admitted\r\nthat the latter was on him--Pullman was the conductor of his only\r\nsleeping-car. The latter was an experiment, and Pullman was doing\r\neverything possible to get the railroads to take hold of it.\r\n\r\n“One night,” said Pullman in telling the story, “as we were about going\r\nout of Chicago--this was long before Lincoln was what you might call\r\na renowned man--a long, lean, ugly man, with a wart on his cheek, came\r\ninto the depot. He paid me fifty cents, and half a berth was assigned\r\nhim. Then he took off his coat and vest and hung them up, and they\r\nfitted the peg about as well as they fitted him. Then he kicked off\r\nhis boots, which were of surprising length, turned into the berth, and,\r\nundoubtedly having an easy conscience, was sleeping like a healthy baby\r\nbefore the car left the depot.\r\n\r\n“Pretty soon along came another passenger and paid his fifty cents. In\r\ntwo minutes he was back at me, angry as a wet hen.\r\n\r\n“‘There’s a man in that berth of mine,’ said he, hotly, ‘and he’s about\r\nten feet high. How am I going to sleep there, I’d like to know? Go and\r\nlook at him.’\r\n\r\n“In I went--mad, too. The tall, lank man’s knees were under his\r\nchin, his arms were stretched across the bed and his feet were stored\r\ncomfortably--for him. I shook him until he awoke, and then told him if\r\nhe wanted the whole berth he would have to pay $1.\r\n\r\n“‘My dear sir,’ said the tall man, ‘a contract is a contract. I have\r\npaid you fifty cents for half this berth, and, as you see, I’m occupying\r\nit. There’s the other half,’ pointing to a strip about six inches wide.\r\n‘Sell that and don’t disturb me again.’\r\n\r\n“And so saying, the man with a wart on his face went to sleep again. He\r\nwas Abraham Lincoln, and he never grew any shorter afterward. We became\r\ngreat friends, and often laughed over the incident.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOULD LICK ANY MAN IN THE CROWD.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemies of General Grant were bothering the President with\r\nemphatic and repeated demands that the “Silent Man” be removed from\r\ncommand, Mr. Lincoln remained firm. He would not consent to lose the\r\nservices of so valuable a soldier. “Grant fights,” said he in response\r\nto the charges made that Grant was a butcher, a drunkard, an incompetent\r\nand a general who did not know his business.\r\n\r\n“That reminds me of a story,” President Lincoln said one day to a\r\ndelegation of the “Grant-is-no-good” style.\r\n\r\n“Out in my State of Illinois there was a man nominated for sheriff of\r\nthe county. He was a good man for the office, brave, determined and\r\nhonest, but not much of an orator. In fact, he couldn’t talk at all; he\r\ncouldn’t make a speech to save his life.\r\n\r\n“His friends knew he was a man who would preserve the peace of the\r\ncounty and perform the duties devolving upon him all right, but the\r\npeople of the county didn’t know it. They wanted him to come out boldly\r\non the platform at political meetings and state his convictions and\r\nprinciples; they had been used to speeches from candidates, and were\r\nsomewhat suspicious of a man who was afraid to open his mouth.\r\n\r\n“At last the candidate consented to make a speech, and his friends were\r\ndelighted. The candidate was on hand, and, when he was called upon,\r\nadvanced to the front and faced the crowd. There was a glitter in his\r\neye that wasn’t pleasing, and the way he walked out to the front of the\r\nstand showed that he knew just what he wanted to say.\r\n\r\n“‘Feller Citizens,’ was his beginning, the words spoken quietly, ‘I’m\r\nnot a speakin’ man; I ain’t no orator, an’ I never stood up before a lot\r\nof people in my life before; I’m not goin’ to make no speech, ‘xcept to\r\nsay that I can lick any man in the crowd!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS WAY TO A CHILD’S HEART.\r\n\r\nCharles E. Anthony’s one meeting with Mr. Lincoln presents an\r\ninteresting contrast to those of the men who shared the emancipator’s\r\ninterest in public affairs. It was in the latter part of the winter\r\nof 1861, a short time before Mr. Lincoln left for his inauguration\r\nat Washington. Judge Anthony went to the Sherman House, where the\r\nPresident-elect was stopping, and took with him his son, Charles, then\r\nbut a little boy. Charles played about the room as a child will, looking\r\nat whatever interested him for the time, and when the interview with his\r\nfather was over he was ready to go.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Lincoln, ever interested in little children, called the lad to\r\nhim and took him upon his great knee.\r\n\r\n“My impression of him all the time I had been playing about the room,”\r\n said Mr. Anthony, “was that he was a terribly homely man. I was rather\r\nrepelled. But no sooner did he speak to me than the expression of his\r\nface changed completely, or, rather, my view of it changed. It at\r\nonce became kindly and attractive. He asked me some questions, seeming\r\ninstantly to find in the turmoil of all the great questions that must\r\nhave been heavy upon him, the very ones that would go to the thought of\r\na child. I answered him without hesitation, and after a moment he patted\r\nmy shoulder and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Well, you’ll be a man before your mother yet,’ and put me down.\r\n\r\n“I had never before heard the homely old expression, and it puzzled me\r\nfor a time. After a moment I understood it, but he looked at me while I\r\nwas puzzling over it, and seemed to be amused, as no doubt he was.”\r\n\r\nThe incident simply illustrates the ease and readiness with which\r\nLincoln could turn from the mighty questions before the nation, give a\r\nmoment’s interested attention to a child, and return at once to matters\r\nof state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“LEFT IT THE WOMEN TO HOWL ABOUT ME.”\r\n\r\nDonn Piatt, one of the brightest newspaper writers in the country, told\r\na good story on the President in regard to the refusal of the latter to\r\nsanction the death penalty in cases of desertion from the Union Army.\r\n\r\n“There was far more policy in this course,” said Piatt, “than kind\r\nfeeling. To assert the contrary is to detract from Lincoln’s force of\r\ncharacter, as well as intellect. Our War President was not lost in his\r\nhigh admiration of brigadiers and major-generals, and had a positive\r\ndislike for their methods and the despotism upon which an army is based.\r\nHe knew that he was dependent upon volunteers for soldiers, and to force\r\nupon such men as those the stern discipline of the Regular Army was to\r\nrender the service unpopular. And it pleased him to be the source of\r\nmercy, as well as the fountain of honor, in this direction.\r\n\r\n“I was sitting with General Dan Tyler, of Connecticut, in the\r\nantechamber of the War Department, shortly after the adjournment of the\r\nBuell Court of Inquiry, of which we had been members, when President\r\nLincoln came in from the room of Secretary Stanton. Seeing us, he said:\r\n‘Well, gentlemen, have you any matter worth reporting?’\r\n\r\n“‘I think so, Mr. President,’ replied General Tyler. ‘We had it proven\r\nthat Bragg, with less than ten thousand men, drove your eighty-three\r\nthousand men under Buell back from before Chattanooga, down to the\r\nOhio at Louisville, marched around us twice, then doubled us up at\r\nPerryville, and finally got out of the State of Kentucky with all his\r\nplunder.’\r\n\r\n“‘Now, Tyler,’ returned the President, ‘what is the meaning of all this;\r\nwhat is the lesson? Don’t our men march as well, and fight as well, as\r\nthese rebels? If not, there is a fault somewhere. We are all of the same\r\nfamily--same sort.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, there is a lesson,’ replied General Tyler; ‘we are of the same\r\nsort, but subject to different handling. Bragg’s little force was\r\nsuperior to our larger number because he had it under control. If a man\r\nleft his ranks, he was punished; if he deserted, he was shot. We had\r\nnothing of that sort. If we attempt to shoot a deserter you pardon him,\r\nand our army is without discipline.’\r\n\r\n“The President looked perplexed. ‘Why do you interfere?’ continued\r\nGeneral Tyler. ‘Congress has taken from you all responsibility.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ answered the President impatiently, ‘Congress has taken the\r\nresponsibility and left the women to howl all about me,’ and so he\r\nstrode away.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE’D RUIN ALL THE OTHER CONVICTS.\r\n\r\nOne of the droll stories brought into play by the President as an ally\r\nin support of his contention, proved most effective. Politics was rife\r\namong the generals of the Union Army, and there was more “wire-pulling”\r\n to prevent the advancement of fellow commanders than the laying of plans\r\nto defeat the Confederates in battle.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it so happened that the name of a particularly unpopular\r\ngeneral was sent to the Senate for confirmation, the protest against\r\nhis promotion was almost unanimous. The nomination didn’t seem to please\r\nanyone. Generals who were enemies before conferred together for the\r\npurpose of bringing every possible influence to bear upon the Senate\r\nand securing the rejection of the hated leader’s name. The President was\r\nsurprised. He had never known such unanimity before.\r\n\r\n“You remind me,” said the President to a delegation of officers which\r\ncalled upon him one day to present a fresh protest to him regarding the\r\nnomination, “of a visit a certain Governor paid to the Penitentiary of\r\nhis State. It had been announced that the Governor would hear the story\r\nof every inmate of the institution, and was prepared to rectify, either\r\nby commutation or pardon, any wrongs that had been done to any prisoner.\r\n\r\n“One by one the convicts appeared before His Excellency, and each one\r\nmaintained that he was an innocent man, who had been sent to prison\r\nbecause the police didn’t like him, or his friends and relatives wanted\r\nhis property, or he was too popular, etc., etc. The last prisoner to\r\nappear was an individual who was not all prepossessing. His face was\r\nagainst him; his eyes were shifty; he didn’t have the appearance of an\r\nhonest man, and he didn’t act like one.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ asked the Governor, impatiently, ‘I suppose you’re innocent\r\nlike the rest of these fellows?’\r\n\r\n“‘No, Governor,’ was the unexpected answer; ‘I was guilty of the crime\r\nthey charged against me, and I got just what I deserved.’\r\n\r\n“When he had recovered from his astonishment, the Governor, looking\r\nthe fellow squarely in the face, remarked with emphasis: ‘I’ll have to\r\npardon you, because I don’t want to leave so bad a man as you are in\r\nthe company of such innocent sufferers as I have discovered your\r\nfellow-convicts to be. You might corrupt them and teach them wicked\r\ntricks. As soon as I get back to the capital, I’ll have the papers made\r\nout.’\r\n\r\n“You gentlemen,” continued the President, “ought to be glad that so bad\r\na man, as you represent this officer to be, is to get his promotion,\r\nfor then you won’t be forced to associate with him and suffer the\r\ncontamination of his presence and influence. I will do all I can to have\r\nthe Senate confirm him.”\r\n\r\nAnd he was confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN A HOPELESS MINORITY.\r\n\r\nThe President was often in opposition to the general public sentiment of\r\nthe North upon certain questions of policy, but he bided his time, and\r\nthings usually came out as he wanted them. It was Lincoln’s opinion,\r\nfrom the first, that apology and reparation to England must be made\r\nby the United States because of the arrest, upon the high seas, of the\r\nConfederate Commissioners, Mason and Slidell. The country, however (the\r\nNorthern States), was wild for a conflict with England.\r\n\r\n“One war at a time,” quietly remarked the President at a Cabinet\r\nmeeting, where he found the majority of his advisers unfavorably\r\ndisposed to “backing down.” But one member of the Cabinet was a really\r\nstrong supporter of the President in his attitude.\r\n\r\n“I am reminded,” the President said after the various arguments had been\r\nput forward by the members of the Cabinet, “of a fellow out in my State\r\nof Illinois who happened to stray into a church while a revival meeting\r\nwas in progress. To be truthful, this individual was not entirely sober,\r\nand with that instinct which seems to impel all men in his condition to\r\nassume a prominent part in proceedings, he walked up the aisle to the\r\nvery front pew.\r\n\r\n“All noticed him, but he did not care; for awhile he joined audibly in\r\nthe singing, said ‘Amen’ at the close of the prayers, but, drowsiness\r\novercoming him, he went to sleep. Before the meeting closed, the\r\npastor asked the usual question--‘Who are on the Lord’s side?’--and the\r\ncongregation arose en masse. When he asked, ‘Who are on the side of\r\nthe Devil?’ the sleeper was about waking up. He heard a portion of the\r\ninterrogatory, and, seeing the minister on his feet, arose.\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t exactly understand the question,’ he said, ‘but I’ll stand by\r\nyou, parson, to the last. But it seems to me,’ he added, ‘that we’re in\r\na hopeless minority.’\r\n\r\n“I’m in a hopeless minority now,” said the President, “and I’ll have to\r\nadmit it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“DID YE ASK MORRISSEY YET?”\r\n\r\nJohn Morrissey, the noted prize fighter, was the “Boss” of Tammany Hall\r\nduring the Civil War period. It pleased his fancy to go to Congress, and\r\nhis obedient constituents sent him there. Morrissey was such an absolute\r\ndespot that the New York City democracy could not make a move without\r\nhis consent, and many of the Tammanyites were so afraid of him that\r\nthey would not even enter into business ventures without consulting the\r\nautocrat.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln had been seriously annoyed by some of his generals,\r\nwho were afraid to make the slightest move before asking advice from\r\nWashington. One commander, in particular, was so cautious that he\r\ntelegraphed the War Department upon the slightest pretext, the result\r\nbeing that his troops were lying in camp doing nothing, when they should\r\nhave been in the field.\r\n\r\n“This general reminds me,” the President said one day while talking to\r\nSecretary Stanton, at the War Department, “of a story I once heard about\r\na Tammany man. He happened to meet a friend, also a member of Tammany,\r\non the street, and in the course of the talk the friend, who was beaming\r\nwith smiles and good nature, told the other Tammanyite that he was going\r\nto be married.\r\n\r\n“This first Tammany man looked more serious than men usually do upon\r\nhearing of the impending happiness of a friend. In fact, his face seemed\r\nto take on a look of anxiety and worry.\r\n\r\n“‘Ain’t you glad to know that I’m to get married?’ demanded the second\r\nTammanyite, somewhat in a huff.\r\n\r\n“‘Of course I am,’ was the reply; ‘but,’ putting his mouth close to the\r\near of the other, ‘have ye asked Morrissey yet?’\r\n\r\n“Now, this general of whom we are speaking, wouldn’t dare order out the\r\nguard without asking Morrissey,” concluded the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOT THE LAUGH ON DOUGLAS.\r\n\r\nAt one time, when Lincoln and Douglas were “stumping” Illinois, they\r\nmet at a certain town, and it was agreed that they would have a joint\r\ndebate. Douglas was the first speaker, and in the course of his talk\r\nremarked that in early life, his father, who, he said, was an excellent\r\ncooper by trade, apprenticed him out to learn the cabinet business.\r\n\r\nThis was too good for Lincoln to let pass, so when his turn came to\r\nreply, he said:\r\n\r\n“I had understood before that Mr. Douglas had been bound out to learn\r\nthe cabinet-making business, which is all well enough, but I was not\r\naware until now that his father was a cooper. I have no doubt, however,\r\nthat he was one, and I am certain, also, that he was a very good one,\r\nfor (here Lincoln gently bowed toward Douglas) he has made one of the\r\nbest whiskey casks I have ever seen.”\r\n\r\nAs Douglas was a short heavy-set man, and occasionally imbibed, the pith\r\nof the joke was at once apparent, and most heartily enjoyed by all.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, Douglas made a point against Lincoln by telling\r\nthe crowd that when he first knew Lincoln he was a “grocery-keeper,” and\r\nsold whiskey, cigars, etc.\r\n\r\n“Mr. L.,” he said, “was a very good bar-tender!” This brought the laugh\r\non Lincoln, whose reply, however, soon came, and then the laugh was on\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\n“What Mr. Douglas has said, gentlemen,” replied Lincoln, “is true\r\nenough; I did keep a grocery and I did sell cotton, candles and cigars,\r\nand sometimes whiskey; but I remember in those days that Mr. Douglas was\r\none of my best customers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I can also say this; that I have since left my side of the counter,\r\nwhile Mr. Douglas still sticks to his!”\r\n\r\nThis brought such a storm of cheers and laughter that Douglas was unable\r\nto reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“FIXED UP” A BIT FOR THE “CITY FOLKS.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln knew her husband was not “pretty,” but she liked to have\r\nhim presentable when he appeared before the public. Stephen Fiske, in\r\n“When Lincoln Was First Inaugurated,” tells of Mrs. Lincoln’s anxiety\r\nto have the President-elect “smoothed down” a little when receiving a\r\ndelegation that was to greet them upon reaching New York City.\r\n\r\n“The train stopped,” writes Mr. Fiske, “and through the windows immense\r\ncrowds could be seen; the cheering drowning the blowing off of steam of\r\nthe locomotive. Then Mrs. Lincoln opened her handbag and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Abraham, I must fix you up a bit for these city folks.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln gently lifted her upon the seat before him; she parted,\r\ncombed and brushed his hair and arranged his black necktie.\r\n\r\n“‘Do I look nice now, mother?’ he affectionately asked.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, you’ll do, Abraham,’ replied Mrs. Lincoln critically. So he\r\nkissed her and lifted her down from the seat, and turned to meet Mayor\r\nWood, courtly and suave, and to have his hand shaken by the other New\r\nYork officials.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVEN REBELS OUGHT TO BE SAVED.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Shrigley, of Philadelphia, a Universalist, had been\r\nnominated for hospital chaplain, and a protesting delegation went to\r\nWashington to see President Lincoln on the subject.\r\n\r\n“We have called, Mr. President, to confer with you in regard to the\r\nappointment of Mr. Shrigley, of Philadelphia, as hospital chaplain.”\r\n\r\nThe President responded: “Oh, yes, gentlemen. I have sent his name to\r\nthe Senate, and he will no doubt be confirmed at an early date.” One of\r\nthe young men replied: “We have not come to ask for the appointment, but\r\nto solicit you to withdraw the nomination.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Lincoln, “that alters the case; but on what grounds do you\r\nwish the nomination withdrawn?”\r\n\r\nThe answer was: “Mr. Shrigley is not sound in his theological opinions.”\r\n\r\nThe President inquired: “On what question is the gentleman unsound?”\r\n\r\nResponse: “He does not believe in endless punishment; not only so, sir,\r\nbut he believes that even the rebels themselves will be finally saved.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?” inquired the President.\r\n\r\nThe members of the committee responded, “Yes, yes.’\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen, if that be so, and there is any way under Heaven\r\nwhereby the rebels can be saved, then, for God’s sake and their sakes,\r\nlet the man be appointed.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Shrigley was appointed, and served until the close of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIED TO DO WHAT SEEMED BEST.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Palmer, Major-General in the Volunteer Army, Governor of the\r\nState of Illinois, and United States Senator from the Sucker State,\r\nbecame acquainted with Lincoln in 1839, and the last time he saw the\r\nPresident was at the White House in February, 1865. Senator Palmer told\r\nthe story of his interview as follows:\r\n\r\n“I had come to Washington at the request of the Governor, to complain\r\nthat Illinois had been credited with 18,000 too few troops. I saw Mr.\r\nLincoln one afternoon, and he asked me to come again in the morning.\r\n\r\n“Next morning I sat in the ante-room while several officers were\r\nrelieved. At length I was told to enter the President’s room. Mr.\r\nLincoln was in the hands of the barber.\r\n\r\n“‘Come in, Palmer,’ he called out, ‘come in. You’re home folks. I can\r\nshave before you. I couldn’t before those others, and I have to do it\r\nsome time.’\r\n\r\n“We chatted about various matters, and at length I said:\r\n\r\n“‘Well, Mr. Lincoln, if anybody had told me that in a great crisis like\r\nthis the people were going out to a little one-horse town and pick out a\r\none-horse lawyer for President I wouldn’t have believed it.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln whirled about in his chair, his face white with lather,\r\na towel under his chin. At first I thought he was angry. Sweeping the\r\nbarber away he leaned forward, and, placing one hand on my knee, said:\r\n\r\n“‘Neither would I. But it was time when a man with a policy would have\r\nbeen fatal to the country. I have never had a policy. I have simply\r\ntried to do what seemed best each day, as each day came.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE CZAR.”\r\n\r\nEngland was anything but pleased when the Czar Alexander, of Russia,\r\nshowed his friendship for the United States by sending a strong fleet\r\nto this country with the accompanying suggestion that Uncle Sam, through\r\nhis representative, President Lincoln, could do whatever he saw fit with\r\nthe ironclads and the munitions of war they had stowed away in their\r\nholds.\r\n\r\nLondon “Punch,” on November 7th, 1863, printed the cartoon shown on this\r\npage, the text under the picture reading in this way: “Holding a candle\r\nto the * * * * *.” (Much the same thing.)\r\n\r\nOf course, this was a covert sneer, intended to convey the impression\r\nthat President Lincoln, in order to secure the support and friendship\r\nof the Emperor of Russia as long as the War of the Rebellion lasted, was\r\nwilling to do all sorts of menial offices, even to the extent of holding\r\nthe candle and lighting His Most Gracious Majesty, the White Czar, to\r\nhis imperial bed-chamber.\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat remarkable fact that the Emperor Alexander, who\r\ntendered inestimable aid to the President of the United States, was\r\nthe Lincoln of Russia, having given freedom to millions of serfs in\r\nhis empire; and, further than that, he was, like Lincoln, the victim of\r\nassassination. He was literally blown to pieces by a bomb thrown under\r\nhis carriage while riding through the streets near the Winter Palace at\r\nSt. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNASHVILLE WAS NOT SURRENDERED.\r\n\r\n“I was told a mighty good story,” said the President one day at a\r\nCabinet meeting, “by Colonel Granville Moody, ‘the fighting Methodist\r\nparson,’ as they used to call him in Tennessee. I happened to meet Moody\r\nin Philadelphia, where he was attending a conference.\r\n\r\n“The story was about ‘Andy’ Johnson and General Buell. Colonel Moody\r\nhappened to be in Nashville the day it was reported that Buell had\r\ndecided to evacuate the city. The rebels, strongly re-inforced, were\r\nsaid to be within two days’ march of the capital. Of course, the city\r\nwas greatly excited. Moody said he went in search of Johnson at the edge\r\nof the evening and found him at his office closeted with two gentlemen,\r\nwho were walking the floor with him, one on each side. As he entered\r\nthey retired, leaving him alone with Johnson, who came up to him,\r\nmanifesting intense feeling, and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Moody, we are sold out. Buell is a traitor. He is going to evacuate\r\nthe city, and in forty-eight hours we will all be in the hands of the\r\nrebels!’\r\n\r\n“Then he commenced pacing the floor again, twisting his hands and\r\nchafing like a caged tiger, utterly insensible to his friend’s\r\nentreaties to become calm. Suddenly he turned and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Moody, can you pray?’\r\n\r\n“‘That is my business, sir, as a minister of the gospel,’ returned the\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, Moody, I wish you would pray,’ said Johnson, and instantly both\r\nwent down upon their knees at opposite sides of the room.\r\n\r\n“As the prayer waxed fervent, Johnson began to respond in true Methodist\r\nstyle. Presently he crawled over on his hands and knees to Moody’s side\r\nand put his arms over him, manifesting the deepest emotion.\r\n\r\n“Closing the prayer with a hearty ‘amen’ from each, they arose.\r\n\r\n“Johnson took a long breath, and said, with emphasis:\r\n\r\n“‘Moody, I feel better.’\r\n\r\n“Shortly afterward he asked:\r\n\r\n“‘Will you stand by me?’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly I will,’ was the answer.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, Moody, I can depend upon you; you are one in a hundred\r\nthousand.’\r\n\r\n“He then commenced pacing the floor again. Suddenly he wheeled, the\r\ncurrent of his thought having changed, and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, Moody, I don’t want you to think I have become a religious man\r\nbecause I asked you to pray. I am sorry to say it, I am not, and never\r\npretended to be religious. No one knows this better than you, but,\r\nMoody, there is one thing about it, I do believe in Almighty God, and\r\nI believe also in the Bible, and I say, d--n me if Nashville shall be\r\nsurrendered!’\r\n\r\n“And Nashville was not surrendered!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE COULDN’T WAIT FOR THE COLONEL.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fisk, attending a reception at the White House, saw waiting in\r\nthe ante-room a poor old man from Tennessee, and learned that he had\r\nbeen waiting three or four days to get an audience, on which probably\r\ndepended the life of his son, under sentence of death for some military\r\noffense.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fisk wrote his case in outline on a card and sent it in, with a\r\nspecial request that the President would see the man. In a moment the\r\norder came; and past impatient senators, governors and generals, the old\r\nman went.\r\n\r\nHe showed his papers to Mr. Lincoln, who said he would look into the\r\ncase and give him the result next day.\r\n\r\nThe old man, in an agony of apprehension, looked up into the President’s\r\nsympathetic face and actually cried out:\r\n\r\n“To-morrow may be too late! My son is under sentence of death! It ought\r\nto be decided now!”\r\n\r\nHis streaming tears told how much he was moved.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Mr. Lincoln, “wait a bit and I’ll tell you a story;” and\r\nthen he told the old man General Fisk’s story about the swearing driver,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“The general had begun his military life as a colonel, and when he\r\nraised his regiment in Missouri he proposed to his men that he should\r\ndo all the swearing of the regiment. They assented; and for months no\r\ninstance was known of the violation of the promise.\r\n\r\n“The colonel had a teamster named John Todd, who, as roads were not\r\nalways the best, had some difficulty in commanding his temper and his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n“John happened to be driving a mule team through a series of mudholes a\r\nlittle worse than usual, when, unable to restrain himself any longer, he\r\nburst forth into a volley of energetic oaths.\r\n\r\n“The colonel took notice of the offense and brought John to account.\r\n\r\n“‘John,’ said he, ‘didn’t you promise to let me do all the swearing of\r\nthe regiment?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, I did, colonel,’ he replied, ‘but the fact was, the swearing had\r\nto be done then or not at all, and you weren’t there to do it.’”\r\n\r\nAs he told the story the old man forgot his boy, and both the President\r\nand his listener had a hearty laugh together at its conclusion.\r\n\r\nThen he wrote a few words which the old man read, and in which he found\r\nnew occasion for tears; but the tears were tears of joy, for the words\r\nsaved the life of his son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN PRONOUNCED THIS STORY FUNNY.\r\n\r\nThe President was heard to declare one day that the story given below\r\nwas one of the funniest he ever heard.\r\n\r\nOne of General Fremont’s batteries of eight Parrott guns, supported by\r\na squadron of horse commanded by Major Richards, was in sharp conflict\r\nwith a battery of the enemy near at hand. Shells and shot were flying\r\nthick and fast, when the commander of the battery, a German, one of\r\nFremont’s staff, rode suddenly up to the cavalry, exclaiming, in loud\r\nand excited terms, “Pring up de shackasses! Pring up de shackasses! For\r\nCot’s sake, hurry up de shackasses, im-me-di-ate-ly!”\r\n\r\nThe necessity of this order, though not quite apparent, will be more\r\nobvious when it is remembered that “shackasses” are mules, carry\r\nmountain howitzers, which are fired from the backs of that much-abused\r\nbut valuable animal; and the immediate occasion for the “shackasses”\r\n was that two regiments of rebel infantry were at that moment discovered\r\nascending a hill immediately behind our batteries.\r\n\r\nThe “shackasses,” with the howitzers loaded with grape and canister,\r\nwere soon on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe mules squared themselves, as they well knew how, for the shock.\r\n\r\nA terrific volley was poured into the advancing column, which\r\nimmediately broke and retreated.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and seventy-eight dead bodies were found in the ravine next\r\nday, piled closely together as they fell, the effects of that volley\r\nfrom the backs of the “shackasses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOKE WAS ON LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln enjoyed a joke at his own expense. Said he: “In the days\r\nwhen I used to be in the circuit, I was accosted in the cars by a\r\nstranger, who said, ‘Excuse me, sir, but I have an article in my\r\npossession which belongs to you.’ ‘How is that?’ I asked, considerably\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n“The stranger took a jackknife from his pocket. ‘This knife,’ said he,\r\n‘was placed in my hands some years ago, with the injunction that I was\r\nto keep it until I had found a man uglier than myself. I have carried\r\nit from that time to this. Allow me to say, sir, that I think you are\r\nfairly entitled to the property.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OTHER ONE WAS WORSE.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that an official of the War Department had escaped\r\nserious punishment for a rather flagrant offense, by showing where\r\ngrosser irregularities existed in the management of a certain bureau\r\nof the Department. So valuable was the information furnished that the\r\nculprit who “gave the snap away” was not even discharged.\r\n\r\n“That reminds me,” the President said, when the case was laid before\r\nhim, “of a story about Daniel Webster, when the latter was a boy.\r\n\r\n“When quite young, at school, Daniel was one day guilty of a gross\r\nviolation of the rules. He was detected in the act, and called up by the\r\nteacher for punishment.\r\n\r\n“This was to be the old-fashioned ‘feruling’ of the hand. His hands\r\nhappened to be very dirty.\r\n\r\n“Knowing this, on the way to the teacher’s desk, he spit upon the palm\r\nof his right hand, wiping it off upon the side of his pantaloons.\r\n\r\n“‘Give me your hand, sir,’ said the teacher, very sternly.\r\n\r\n“Out went the right hand, partly cleansed. The teacher looked at it a\r\nmoment, and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Daniel, if you will find another hand in this school-room as filthy as\r\nthat, I will let you off this time!’\r\n\r\n“Instantly from behind the back came the left hand.\r\n\r\n“‘Here it is, sir,’ was the ready reply.\r\n\r\n“‘That will do,’ said the teacher, ‘for this time; you can take your\r\nseat, sir.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’D A BEEN MISSED BY MYSE’F.”\r\n\r\nThe President did not consider that every soldier who ran away in\r\nbattle, or did not stand firmly to receive a bayonet charge, was a\r\ncoward. He was of opinion that self-preservation was the first law of\r\nNature, but he didn’t want this statute construed too liberally by the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he took occasion to illustrate a point he wished to\r\nmake by a story in connection with a darky who was a member of the Ninth\r\nIllinois Infantry Regiment. This regiment was one of those engaged at\r\nthe capture of Fort Donelson. It behaved gallantly, and lost as heavily\r\nas any.\r\n\r\n“Upon the hurricane-deck of one of our gunboats,” said the President in\r\ntelling the story, “I saw an elderly darky, with a very philosophical\r\nand retrospective cast of countenance, squatted upon his bundle,\r\ntoasting his shins against the chimney, and apparently plunged into a\r\nstate of profound meditation.\r\n\r\n“As the negro rather interested me, I made some inquiries, and found\r\nthat he had really been with the Ninth Illinois Infantry at Donelson.\r\nand began to ask him some questions about the capture of the place.\r\n\r\n“‘Were you in the fight?’\r\n\r\n“‘Had a little taste of it, sa.’\r\n\r\n“‘Stood your ground, did you?’\r\n\r\n“‘No, sa, I runs.’\r\n\r\n“‘Run at the first fire, did you?\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, sa, and would hab run soona, had I knowd it war comin’.”\r\n\r\n“‘Why, that wasn’t very creditable to your courage.’\r\n\r\n“‘Dat isn’t my line, sa--cookin’s my profeshun.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, but have you no regard for your reputation?’\r\n\r\n“‘Reputation’s nuffin to me by de side ob life.’\r\n\r\n“‘Do you consider your life worth more than other people’s?’\r\n\r\n“‘It’s worth more to me, sa.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then you must value it very highly?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, sa, I does, more dan all dis wuld, more dan a million ob\r\ndollars, sa, for what would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref out ob him?\r\nSelf-preserbation am de fust law wid me.’\r\n\r\n“‘But why should you act upon a different rule from other men?’\r\n\r\n“‘Different men set different values on their lives; mine is not in de\r\nmarket.’\r\n\r\n“‘But if you lost it you would have the satisfaction of knowing that you\r\ndied for your country.’\r\n\r\n“‘Dat no satisfaction when feelin’s gone.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then patriotism and honor are nothing to you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Nufin whatever, sat--I regard them as among the vanities.’\r\n\r\n“‘If our soldiers were like you, traitors might have broken up the\r\ngovernment without resistance.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, sa, dar would hab been no help for it. I wouldn’t put my life\r\nin de scale ‘g’inst any gobernment dat eber existed, for no gobernment\r\ncould replace de loss to me.’\r\n\r\n“‘Do you think any of your company would have missed you if you had been\r\nkilled?’\r\n\r\n“‘Maybe not, sa--a dead white man ain’t much to dese sogers, let alone a\r\ndead nigga--but I’d a missed myse’f, and dat was de p’int wid me.’\r\n\r\n“I only tell this story,” concluded the President, “in order to\r\nillustrate the result of the tactics of some of the Union generals who\r\nwould be sadly ‘missed’ by themselves, if no one else, if they ever got\r\nout of the Army.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT ALL “DEPENDED” UPON THE EFFECT.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln and some members of his Cabinet were with a part of\r\nthe Army some distance south of the National Capital at one time, when\r\nSecretary of War Stanton remarked that just before he left Washington\r\nhe had received a telegram from General Mitchell, in Alabama. General\r\nMitchell asked instructions in regard to a certain emergency that had\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary said he did not precisely understand the emergency as\r\nexplained by General Mitchell, but had answered back, “All right; go\r\nahead.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, as he turned to Mr. Lincoln, “Mr. President, if I have\r\nmade an error in not understanding him correctly, I will have to get you\r\nto countermand the order.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” exclaimed President Lincoln, “that is very much like the\r\nhappening on the occasion of a certain horse sale I remember that took\r\nplace at the cross-roads down in Kentucky, when I was a boy.\r\n\r\n“A particularly fine horse was to be sold, and the people in large\r\nnumbers had gathered together. They had a small boy to ride the horse up\r\nand down while the spectators examined the horse’s points.\r\n\r\n“At last one man whispered to the boy as he went by: ‘Look here, boy,\r\nhain’t that horse got the splints?’\r\n\r\n“The boy replied: ‘Mister, I don’t know what the splints is, but if it’s\r\ngood for him, he has got it; if it ain’t good for him, he ain’t got it.’\r\n\r\n“Now,” said President Lincoln, “if this was good for Mitchell, it was\r\nall right; but if it was not, I have got to countermand it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO SWIFT TO STAY IN THE ARMY.\r\n\r\nThere were strange, queer, odd things and happenings in the Army at\r\ntimes, but, as a rule, the President did not allow them to worry him. He\r\nhad enough to bother about.\r\n\r\nA quartermaster having neglected to present his accounts in proper\r\nshape, and the matter being deemed of sufficient importance to bring it\r\nto the attention of the President, the latter remarked:\r\n\r\n“Now this instance reminds me of a little story I heard only a short\r\ntime ago. A certain general’s purse was getting low, and he said it was\r\nprobable he might be obliged to draw on his banker for some money.\r\n\r\n“‘How much do you want, father?’ asked his son, who had been with him a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\n“‘I think I shall send for a couple of hundred,’ replied the general.\r\n\r\n“Why, father,’ said his son, very quietly, ‘I can let you have it.’\r\n\r\n“‘You can let me have it! Where did you get so much money?\r\n\r\n“‘I won it playing draw-poker with your staff, sir!’ replied the youth.\r\n\r\n“The earliest morning train bore the young man toward his home, and I’ve\r\nbeen wondering if that boy and that quartermaster had happened to meet\r\nat the same table.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRED THE STRONG MAN.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hoyt of Wisconsin tells a story of Mr. Lincoln’s great\r\nadmiration for physical strength. Mr. Lincoln, in 1859, made a speech at\r\nthe Wisconsin State Agricultural Fair. After the speech, in company with\r\nthe Governor, he strolled about the grounds, looking at the exhibits.\r\nThey came to a place where a professional “strong man” was tossing\r\ncannon balls in the air and catching them on his arms and juggling\r\nwith them as though they were light as baseballs. Mr. Lincoln had\r\nnever before seen such an exhibition, and he was greatly surprised and\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nWhen the performance was over, Governor Hoyt, seeing Mr. Lincoln’s\r\ninterest, asked him to go up and be introduced to the athlete. He did\r\nso, and, as he stood looking down musingly on the man, who was very\r\nshort, and evidently wondering that one so much smaller than he could be\r\nso much stronger, he suddenly broke out with one of his quaint speeches.\r\n“Why,” he said, “why, I could lick salt off the top of your hat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISHED THE ARMY CHARGED LIKE THAT.\r\n\r\nA prominent volunteer officer who, early in the War, was on duty in\r\nWashington and often carried reports to Secretary Stanton at the War\r\nDepartment, told a characteristic story on President Lincoln. Said he:\r\n\r\n“I was with several other young officers, also carrying reports to the\r\nWar Department, and one morning we were late. In this instance we were\r\nin a desperate hurry to deliver the papers, in order to be able to catch\r\nthe train returning to camp.\r\n\r\n“On the winding, dark staircase of the old War Department, which many\r\nwill remember, it was our misfortune, while taking about three stairs\r\nat a time, to run a certain head like a catapult into the body of the\r\nPresident, striking him in the region of the right lower vest pocket.\r\n\r\n“The usual surprised and relaxed grunt of a man thus assailed came\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n“We quickly sent an apology in the direction of the dimly seen form,\r\nfeeling that the ungracious shock was expensive, even to the humblest\r\nclerk in the department.\r\n\r\n“A second glance revealed to us the President as the victim of the\r\ncollision. Then followed a special tender of ‘ten thousand pardons,’ and\r\nthe President’s reply:\r\n\r\n“‘One’s enough; I wish the whole army would charge like that.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“UNCLE ABRAHAM” HAD EVERYTHING READY.\r\n\r\n“You can’t do anything with them Southern fellows,” the old man at the\r\ntable was saying.\r\n\r\n“If they get whipped, they’ll retreat to them Southern swamps and bayous\r\nalong with the fishes and crocodiles. You haven’t got the fish-nets made\r\nthat’ll catch ‘em.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, old gentleman,” remarked President Lincoln, who was sitting\r\nalongside, “we’ve got just the nets for traitors, in the bayous or\r\nanywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Hey? What nets?”\r\n\r\n“Bayou-nets!” and “Uncle Abraham” pointed his joke with his fork,\r\nspearing a fishball savagely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT AS SMOOTH AS HE LOOKED.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s skill in parrying troublesome questions was wonderful.\r\nOnce he received a call from Congressman John Ganson, of Buffalo, one of\r\nthe ablest lawyers in New York, who, although a Democrat, supported\r\nall of Mr. Lincoln’s war measures. Mr. Ganson wanted explanations. Mr.\r\nGanson was very bald with a perfectly smooth face. He had a most direct\r\nand aggressive way of stating his views or of demanding what he thought\r\nhe was entitled to. He said: “Mr. Lincoln, I have supported all of your\r\nmeasures and think I am entitled to your confidence. We are voting and\r\nacting in the dark in Congress, and I demand to know--think I have the\r\nright to ask and to know--what is the present situation, and what are\r\nthe prospects and conditions of the several campaigns and armies.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln looked at him critically for a moment and then said:\r\n“Ganson, how clean you shave!”\r\n\r\nMost men would have been offended, but Ganson was too broad and\r\nintelligent a man not to see the point and retire at once, satisfied,\r\nfrom the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SMALL CROP.\r\n\r\nChauncey M. Depew says that Mr. Lincoln told him the following story,\r\nwhich he claimed was one of the best two things he ever originated: He\r\nwas trying a case in Illinois where he appeared for a prisoner charged\r\nwith aggravated assault and battery. The complainant had told a horrible\r\nstory of the attack, which his appearance fully justified, when\r\nthe District Attorney handed the witness over to Mr. Lincoln, for\r\ncross-examination. Mr. Lincoln said he had no testimony, and unless he\r\ncould break down the complainant’s story he saw no way out. He had\r\ncome to the conclusion that the witness was a bumptious man, who rather\r\nprided himself upon his smartness in repartee and, so, after looking at\r\nhim for some minutes, he said:\r\n\r\n“Well, my friend, how much ground did you and my client here fight\r\nover?”\r\n\r\nThe fellow answered: “About six acres.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Lincoln, “don’t you think that this is an almighty\r\nsmall crop of fight to gather from such a big piece of ground?”\r\n\r\nThe jury laughed. The Court and District-Attorney and complainant all\r\njoined in, and the case was laughed out of court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“NEVER REGRET WHAT YOU DON’T WRITE.”\r\n\r\nA simple remark one of the party might make would remind Mr. Lincoln of\r\nan apropos story.\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Treasury Chase happened to remark, “Oh, I am so sorry\r\nthat I did not write a letter to Mr. So-and-so before I left home!”\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln promptly responded:\r\n\r\n“Chase, never regret what you don’t write; it is what you do write that\r\nyou are often called upon to feel sorry for.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VAIN GENERAL.\r\n\r\nIn an interview between President Lincoln and Petroleum V. Nasby, the\r\nname came up of a recently deceased politician of Illinois whose merit\r\nwas blemished by great vanity. His funeral was very largely attended.\r\n\r\n“If General ---- had known how big a funeral he would have had,” said\r\nMr. Lincoln, “he would have died years ago.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH BED REPENTANCE.\r\n\r\nA Senator, who was calling upon Mr. Lincoln, mentioned the name of a\r\nmost virulent and dishonest official; one, who, though very brilliant,\r\nwas very bad.\r\n\r\n“It’s a good thing for B----” said Mr. Lincoln, “that there is such a\r\nthing as a deathbed repentance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO CAUSE FOR PRIDE.\r\n\r\nA member of Congress from Ohio came into Mr. Lincoln’s presence in a\r\nstate of unutterable intoxication, and sinking into a chair, exclaimed\r\nin tones that welled up fuzzy through the gallon or more of whiskey that\r\nhe contained, “Oh, ‘why should (hic) the spirit of mortal be proud?’”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” said the President, regarding him closely, “I see no\r\nreason whatever.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF LINCOLN’S LIFE\r\n\r\nWhen Abraham Lincoln once was asked to tell the story of his life, he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“It is contained in one line of Gray’s ‘Elegy in a Country Churchyard’:\r\n\r\n“‘The short and simple annals of the poor.’”\r\n\r\nThat was true at the time he said it, as everything else he said was\r\nTruth, but he was then only at the beginning of a career that was\r\nto glorify him as one of the heroes of the world, and place his name\r\nforever beside the immortal name of the mighty Washington.\r\n\r\nMany great men, particularly those of America, began life in humbleness\r\nand poverty, but none ever came from such depths or rose to such a\r\nheight as Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHis birthplace, in Hardin county, Kentucky, was but a wilderness,\r\nand Spencer county, Indiana, to which the Lincoln family removed when\r\nAbraham was in his eighth year, was a wilder and still more uncivilized\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nThe little red schoolhouse which now so thickly adorns the country\r\nhillside had not yet been built. There were scattered log schoolhouses,\r\nbut they were few and far between. In several of these Mr. Lincoln got\r\nthe rudiments of an education--an education that was never finished, for\r\nto the day of his death he was a student and a seeker after knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome records of his schoolboy days are still left us. One is a book\r\nmade and bound by Lincoln himself, in which he had written the table of\r\nweights and measures, and the sums to be worked out therefrom. This was\r\nhis arithmetic, for he was too poor to own a printed copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA YOUTHFUL POET.\r\n\r\nOn one of the pages of this quaint book he had written these four lines\r\nof schoolboy doggerel:\r\n\r\n     “Abraham Lincoln,\r\n       His Hand and Pen,\r\n     He Will be Good,\r\n       But God knows when.”\r\n\r\nThe poetic spirit was strong in the young scholar just then for on\r\nanother page of the same book he had written these two verses, which are\r\nsupposed to have been original with him:\r\n\r\n     “Time, what an empty vapor ‘tis,\r\n       And days, how swift they are;\r\n     Swift as an Indian arrow\r\n       Fly on like a shooting star.\r\n\r\n     The present moment just is here,\r\n       Then slides away in haste,\r\n     That we can never say they’re ours,\r\n       But only say they’re past.”\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of the poetical, or rhyming ability, is found in the\r\nfollowing couplet, written by him for his friend, Joseph C. Richardson:\r\n\r\n     “Good boys who to their books apply,\r\n      Will all be great men by and by.”\r\n\r\nIn all, Lincoln’s “schooling” did not amount to a year’s time, but he\r\nwas a constant student outside of the schoolhouse. He read all the books\r\nhe could borrow, and it was his chief delight during the day to lie\r\nunder the shade of some tree, or at night in front of an open fireplace,\r\nreading and studying. His favorite books were the Bible and Aesop’s\r\nfables, which he kept always within reach and read time and again.\r\n\r\nThe first law book he ever read was “The Statutes of Indiana,” and it\r\nwas from this work that he derived his ambition to be a lawyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADE SPEECHES WHEN A BOY.\r\n\r\nWhen he was but a barefoot boy he would often make political speeches to\r\nthe boys in the neighborhood, and when he had reached young manhood\r\nand was engaged in the labor of chopping wood or splitting rails\r\nhe continued this practice of speech-making with only the stumps and\r\nsurrounding trees for hearers.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen he had attained his full height of six feet four\r\ninches and it was at this time he engaged as a ferry boatman on the Ohio\r\nriver, at thirty-seven cents a day.\r\n\r\nThat he was seriously beginning to think of public affairs even at\r\nthis early age is shown by the fact that about this time he wrote\r\na composition on the American Government, urging the necessity for\r\npreserving the Constitution and perpetuating the Union. A Rockport\r\nlawyer, by the name of Pickert, who read this composition, declared that\r\n“the world couldn’t beat it.”\r\n\r\nWhen the dreaded disease, known as the “milk-sick” created such havoc\r\nin Indiana in 1829, the father of Abraham Lincoln, who was of a roving\r\ndisposition, sought and found a new home in Illinois, locating near the\r\ntown of Decatur, in Macon county, on a bluff overlooking the Sangamon\r\nriver. A short time thereafter Abraham Lincoln came of age, and having\r\ndone his duty to his father, began life on his own account.\r\n\r\nHis first employer was a man named Denton Offut, who engaged Lincoln,\r\ntogether with his step-brother and John Hanks, to take a boat-load of\r\nstock and provisions to New Orleans. Offut was so well pleased with the\r\nenergy and skill that Lincoln displayed on this trip that he engaged him\r\nas clerk in a store which Offut opened a few months later at New Salem.\r\n\r\nIt was while clerking for Offut that Lincoln performed many of those\r\nmarvelous feats of strength for which he was noted in his youth, and\r\ndisplayed his wonderful skill as a wrestler. In addition to being six\r\nfeet four inches high he now weighed two hundred and fourteen pounds.\r\nAnd his strength and skill were so great combined that he could\r\nout-wrestle and out-lift any man in that section of the country.\r\n\r\nDuring his clerkship in Offut’s store Lincoln continued to read and\r\nstudy and made considerable progress in grammar and mathematics. Offut\r\nfailed in business and disappeared from the village. In the language of\r\nLincoln he “petered out,” and his tall, muscular clerk had to seek other\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASSISTANT PILOT ON A STEAMBOAT.\r\n\r\nIn his first public speech, which had already been delivered, Lincoln\r\nhad contended that the Sangamon river was navigable, and it now fell to\r\nhis lot to assist in giving practical proof of his argument. A steamboat\r\nhad arrived at New Salem from Cincinnati, and Lincoln was hired as an\r\nassistant in piloting the vessel through the uncertain channel of\r\nthe Sangamon river to the Illinois river. The way was obstructed by\r\na milldam. Lincoln insisted to the owners of the dam that under the\r\nFederal Constitution and laws no one had a right to dam up or obstruct\r\na navigable stream and as he had already proved that the Sangamon was\r\nnavigable a portion of the dam was torn away and the boat passed safely\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“CAPTAIN LINCOLN” PLEASED HIM.\r\n\r\nAt this period in his career the Blackhawk War broke out, and Lincoln\r\nwas one of the first to respond to Governor Reynold’s call for a\r\nthousand mounted volunteers to assist the United States troops in\r\ndriving Blackhawk back across the Mississippi. Lincoln enlisted in the\r\ncompany from Sangamon county and was elected captain. He often remarked\r\nthat this gave him greater pleasure than anything that had happened in\r\nhis life up to this time. He had, however, no opportunities in this war\r\nto perform any distinguished service.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from the Blackhawk War, in which, as he said afterward,\r\nin a humorous speech, when in Congress, that he “fought, bled and came\r\naway,” he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Legislature. This was\r\nthe only time in his life, as he himself has said, that he was ever\r\nbeaten by the people. Although defeated, in his own town of New Salem he\r\nreceived all of the two hundred and eight votes cast except three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE AS A BUSINESS MAN.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s next business venture was with William Berry in a general\r\nstore, under the firm name of Lincoln & Berry, but did not take long\r\nto show that he was not adapted for a business career. The firm failed,\r\nBerry died and the debts of the firm fell entirely upon Lincoln. Many of\r\nthese debts he might have escaped legally, but he assumed them all\r\nand it was not until fifteen years later that the last indebtedness of\r\nLincoln & Berry was discharged. During his membership in this firm he\r\nhad applied himself to the study of law, beginning at the beginning,\r\nthat is with Blackstone. Now that he had nothing to do he spent much of\r\nhis time lying under the shade of a tree poring over law books, borrowed\r\nfrom a comrade in the Blackhawk War, who was then a practicing lawyer at\r\nSpringfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAINS FAME AS A STORY TELLER.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, too, that Lincoln’s fame as a story-teller\r\nbegan to spread far and wide. His sayings and his jokes were repeated\r\nthroughout that section of the country, and he was famous as a\r\nstory-teller before anyone ever heard of him as a lawyer or a\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nIt required no little moral courage to resist the temptation that beset\r\nan idle young man on every hand at that time, for drinking and carousing\r\nwere of daily and nightly occurrence. Lincoln never drank intoxicating\r\nliquors, nor did he at that time use tobacco, but in any sports that\r\ncalled for skill or muscle he took a lively interest, even in horse\r\nraces and cock fights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEYOR WITH NO STRINGS ON HIM.\r\n\r\nJohn Calhoun was at that time surveyor of Sangamon county. He had been\r\na lawyer and had noticed the studious Lincoln. Needing an assistant he\r\noffered the place to Lincoln. The average young man without any regular\r\nemployment and hard-pressed for means to pay his board as Lincoln was,\r\nwould have jumped at the opportunity, but a question of principle was\r\ninvolved which had to be settled before Lincoln would accept. Calhoun\r\nwas a Democrat and Lincoln was a Whig, therefore Lincoln said, “I will\r\ntake the office if I can be perfectly free in my political actions, but\r\nif my sentiments or even expression of them are to be abridged in any\r\nway, I would not have it or any other office.”\r\n\r\nWith this understanding he accepted the office and began to study\r\nbooks on surveying, furnished him by his employer. He was not a natural\r\nmathematician, and in working out his most difficult problems he sought\r\nthe assistance of Mentor Graham, a famous schoolmaster in those days,\r\nwho had previously assisted Lincoln in his studies. He soon became a\r\ncompetent surveyor, however, and was noted for the accurate way in which\r\nhe ran his lines and located his corners.\r\n\r\nSurveying was not as profitable then as it has since become, and the\r\nyoung surveyor often had to take his pay in some article other than\r\nmoney. One old settler relates that for a survey made for him by Lincoln\r\nhe paid two buckskins, which Hannah Armstrong “foxed” on his pants so\r\nthat the briars would not wear them out.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, 1833, he was made postmaster at New Salem, the first\r\nFederal office he ever held. Although the postoffice was located in\r\na store, Lincoln usually carried the mail around in his hat and\r\ndistributed it to people when he met them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following year Lincoln again ran for the Legislature, this time as\r\nan avowed Whig. Of the four successful candidates, Lincoln received the\r\nsecond highest number of votes.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln went to take his seat in the Legislature at Vandalia he was\r\nso poor that he was obliged to borrow $200 to buy suitable clothes\r\nand uphold the dignity of his new position. He took little part in\r\nthe proceedings, keeping in the background, but forming many lasting\r\nacquaintances and friendships.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, when he was again a candidate for the same office,\r\nthere were more political issues to be met, and Lincoln met them with\r\ncharacteristic honesty and boldness. During the campaign he issued the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n“New Salem, June 13, 1836.\r\n\r\n“To the Editor of The Journal:\r\n\r\n“In your paper of last Saturday I see a communication over the signature\r\nof ‘Many Voters’ in which the candidates who are announced in the\r\njournal are called upon to ‘show their hands.’ Agreed. Here’s mine:\r\n\r\n“I go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in\r\nbearing its burdens. Consequently, I go for admitting all whites to\r\nthe right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms (by no means excluding\r\nfemales).\r\n\r\n“If elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon my\r\nconstituents, as well those that oppose as those that support me.\r\n\r\n“While acting as their Representative, I shall be governed by their will\r\non all subjects upon which I have the means of knowing what their will\r\nis; and upon all others I shall do what my own judgment teaches me\r\nwill best advance their interests. Whether elected or not, I go for\r\ndistributing the proceeds of the sales of public lands to the several\r\nStates to enable our State, in common with others, to dig canals and\r\nconstruct railroads without borrowing money and paying the interest on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“If alive on the first Monday in November, I shall vote for Hugh L.\r\nWhite, for President.\r\n\r\n“Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n“A. LINCOLN.”\r\n\r\nThis was just the sort of letter to win the support of the plain-spoken\r\nvoters of Sangamon county. Lincoln not only received more votes than\r\nany other candidate on the Legislative ticket, but the county which had\r\nalways been Democratic was turned Whig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAMOUS “LONG NINE.”\r\n\r\nThe other candidates elected with Lincoln were Ninian W. Edwards, John\r\nDawson, Andrew McCormick, “Dan” Stone, William F. Elkin, Robert L.\r\nWilson, “Joe” Fletcher, and Archer G. Herndon. These were known as the\r\n“Long Nine.” Their average height was six feet, and average weight two\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThis Legislature was one of the most famous that ever convened in\r\nIllinois. Bonds to the amount of $12,000,000 were voted to assist in\r\nbuilding thirteen hundred miles of railroad, to widen and deepen all the\r\nstreams in the State and to dig a canal from the Illinois river to Lake\r\nMichigan. Lincoln favored all these plans, but in justice to him it must\r\nbe said that the people he represented were also in favor of them.\r\n\r\nIt was at this session that the State capital was changed from Vandalia\r\nto Springfield. Lincoln, as the leader of the “Long Nine,” had charge of\r\nthe bill and after a long and bitter struggle succeeded in passing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINS TO OPPOSE SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nAt this early stage in his career Abraham Lincoln began his opposition\r\nto slavery which eventually resulted in his giving liberty to four\r\nmillion human beings. This Legislature passed the following resolutions\r\non slavery:\r\n\r\n“Resolved by the General Assembly, of the State of Illinois: That we\r\nhighly disapprove of the formation of Abolition societies and of the\r\ndoctrines promulgated by them.\r\n\r\n“That the right of property in slaves is sacred to the slave-holding\r\nStates by the Federal Constitution, and that they cannot be deprived of\r\nthat right without their consent,\r\n\r\n“That the General Government cannot abolish slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia against the consent of the citizens of said district without a\r\nmanifest breach of good faith.”\r\n\r\nAgainst this resolution Lincoln entered a protest, but only succeeded in\r\ngetting one man in the Legislature to sign the protest with him.\r\n\r\nThe protest was as follows:\r\n\r\n“Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both\r\nbranches of the General Assembly at its present session, the undersigned\r\nhereby protest against the passage of the same.\r\n\r\n“They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both\r\ninjustice and bad policy, but that the promulgation of abolition\r\ndoctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\r\n\r\n“They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power under\r\nthe Constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\n“They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power under\r\nthe Constitution to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but\r\nthat the power ought not to be exercised unless at the request of the\r\npeople of the District.\r\n\r\n“The difference between these opinions and those contained in the above\r\nresolutions is their reason for entering this protest.\r\n\r\n“DAN STONE,\r\n\r\n“A. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n“Representatives from the county of Sangamon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINS TO PRACTICE LAW.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this session of the Legislature, Mr. Lincoln decided to\r\nremove to Springfield and practice law. He entered the office of John T.\r\nStuart, a former comrade in the Blackhawk War, and in March, 1837, was\r\nlicensed to practice.\r\n\r\nStephen T. Logan was judge of the Circuit Court, and Stephen A. Douglas,\r\nwho was destined to become Lincoln’s greatest political opponent,\r\nwas prosecuting attorney. When Lincoln was not in his law office his\r\nheadquarters were in the store of his friend Joshua F. Speed, in which\r\ngathered all the youthful orators and statesmen of that day, and where\r\nmany exciting arguments and discussions were held. Lincoln and Douglas\r\nboth took part in the discussion held in Speed’s store. Douglas was\r\nthe acknowledged leader of the Democratic side and Lincoln was rapidly\r\ncoming to the front as a leader among the Whig debaters. One evening in\r\nthe midst of a heated argument Douglas, or “the Little Giant,” as he was\r\ncalled, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“This store is no place to talk politics.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FIRST JOINT DEBATE.\r\n\r\nArrangements were at once made for a joint debate between the leading\r\nDemocrats and Whigs to take place in a local church. The Democrats were\r\nrepresented by Douglas, Calhoun, Lamborn and Thomas. The Whig speakers\r\nwere Judge Logan, Colonel E. D. Baker, Mr. Browning and Lincoln. This\r\ndiscussion was the forerunner of the famous joint-debate between\r\nLincoln and Douglas, which took place some years later and attracted\r\nthe attention of the people throughout the United States. Although Mr.\r\nLincoln was the last speaker in the first discussion held, his speech\r\nattracted more attention than any of the others and added much to his\r\nreputation as a public debater.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s last campaign for the Legislature was in 1840. In the same\r\nyear he was made an elector on the Harrison presidential ticket, and\r\nin his canvass of the State frequently met the Democratic champion,\r\nDouglas, in debate. After 1840 Mr. Lincoln declined re-election to the\r\nLegislature, but he was a presidential elector on the Whig tickets of\r\n1844 and 1852, and on the Republican ticket for the State at large in\r\n1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIES A SPRINGFIELD BELLE.\r\n\r\nAmong the social belles of Springfield was Mary Todd, a handsome and\r\ncultivated girl of the illustrious descent which could be traced back to\r\nthe sixth century, to whom Mr. Lincoln was married in 1842. Stephen A.\r\nDouglas was his competitor in love as well as in politics. He courted\r\nMary Todd until it became evident that she preferred Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nPrevious to his marriage Mr. Lincoln had two love affairs, one of them\r\nso serious that it left an impression upon his whole future life. One\r\nof the objects of his affection was Miss Mary Owen, of Green county,\r\nKentucky, who decided that Mr. Lincoln “was deficient in those little\r\nlinks which make up the chain of woman’s happiness.” The affair ended\r\nwithout any damage to Mr. Lincoln’s heart or the heart of the lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF ANNE RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s first love, however, had a sad termination. The object of his\r\naffections at that time was Anne Rutledge, whose father was one of the\r\nfounders of New Salem. Like Miss Owen, Miss Rutledge was also born in\r\nKentucky, and was gifted with the beauty and graces that distinguish\r\nmany Southern women. At the time that Mr. Lincoln and Anne Rutledge were\r\nengaged to be married, he thought himself too poor to properly support\r\na wife, and they decided to wait until such time as he could better his\r\nfinancial condition. A short time thereafter Miss Rutledge was attacked\r\nwith a fatal illness, and her death was such a blow to her intended\r\nhusband that for a long time his friends feared that he would lose his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS DUEL WITH SHIELDS.\r\n\r\nJust previous to his marriage with Mary Todd, Mr. Lincoln was challenged\r\nto fight a duel by James Shields, then Auditor of State. The challenge\r\ngrew out of some humorous letters concerning Shields, published in a\r\nlocal paper. The first of these letters was written by Mr. Lincoln.\r\nThe others by Mary Todd and her sister. Mr. Lincoln acknowledged the\r\nauthorship of the letters without naming the ladies, and agreed to meet\r\nShields on the field of honor. As he had the choice of weapons he named\r\nbroadswords, and actually went to the place selected for the duel.\r\n\r\nThe duel was never fought. Mutual friends got together and patched up an\r\nunderstanding between Mr. Lincoln and the hot-headed Irishman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS NEW PARTNERSHIP.\r\n\r\nBefore this time Mr. Lincoln had dissolved partnership with Stuart and\r\nentered into a law partnership with Judge Logan. In 1843 both Lincoln\r\nand Logan were candidates for nomination for Congress and the personal\r\nill-will caused by their rivalry resulted in the dissolution of the\r\nfirm and the formation of a new law firm of Lincoln & Herndon, which\r\ncontinued, nominally at least, until Mr. Lincoln’s death.\r\n\r\nThe congressional nomination, however, went to Edward D. Baker, who\r\nwas elected. Two years later the principal candidates for the Whig\r\nnomination for Congress were Mr. Lincoln and his former law partner,\r\nJudge Logan. Party sentiment was so strongly in favor of Lincoln that\r\nJudge Logan withdrew and Lincoln was nominated unanimously. The campaign\r\nthat followed was one of the most memorable and interesting ever held in\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFEATS PETER CARTWRIGHT FOR CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s opponent on the Democratic ticket was no less a person\r\nthan old Peter Cartwright, the famous Methodist preacher and circuit\r\nrider. Cartwright had preached to almost every congregation in the\r\ndistrict and had a strong following in all the churches. Mr. Lincoln did\r\nnot underestimate the strength of his great rival. He abandoned his law\r\nbusiness entirely and gave his whole attention to the canvass. This time\r\nMr. Lincoln was victorious and was elected by a large majority.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln took his seat in Congress, in 1847, he was the only Whig\r\nmember from Illinois. His great political rival, Douglas, was in the\r\nSenate. The Mexican War had already broken out, which, in common with\r\nhis party, he had opposed. Later in life he was charged with having\r\nopposed the voting of supplies to the American troops in Mexico, but\r\nthis was a falsehood which he easily disproved. He was strongly\r\nopposed to the War, but after it was once begun he urged its vigorous\r\nprosecution and voted with the Democrats on all measures concerning the\r\ncare and pay of the soldiers. His opposition to the War, however, cost\r\nhim a re-election; it cost his party the congressional district, which\r\nwas carried by the Democrats in 1848. Lincoln’s former law partner,\r\nJudge Logan, secured the Whig nomination that year and was defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKES SPEECHES FOR “OLD ZACH.”\r\n\r\nIn the national convention at Philadelphia, in 1848, Mr. Lincoln was a\r\ndelegate and advocated the nomination of General Taylor.\r\n\r\nAfter the nomination of General Taylor, or “Old Zach,” or “rough and\r\nReady,” as he was called, Mr. Lincoln made a tour of New York and\r\nseveral New England States, making speeches for his candidate.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln went to New England in this campaign on account of the\r\ngreat defection in the Whig party. General Taylor’s nomination was\r\nunsatisfactory to the free-soil element, and such leaders as Henry\r\nWilson, Charles Francis Adams, Charles Allen, Charles Sumner, Stephen\r\nC. Phillips, Richard H. Dana, Jr., and Anson Burlingame, were in open\r\nrevolt. Mr. Lincoln’s speeches were confined largely to a defense of\r\nGeneral Taylor, but at the same time he denounced the free-soilers for\r\nhelping to elect Cass. Among other things he said that the free-soilers\r\nhad but one principle and that they reminded him of the Yankee peddler\r\ngoing to sell a pair of pantaloons and describing them as “large enough\r\nfor any man, and small enough for any boy.”\r\n\r\nIt is an odd fact in history that the prominent Whigs of Massachusetts\r\nat that time became the opponents of Mr. Lincoln’s election to the\r\npresidency and the policy of his administration, while the free-soilers,\r\nwhom he denounced, were among his strongest supporters, advisers and\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nAt the second session of Congress Mr. Lincoln’s one act of consequence\r\nwas the introduction of a bill providing for the gradual emancipation\r\nof the slaves in the District of Columbia. Joshua R. Giddings, the great\r\nantislavery agitator, and one or two lesser lights supported it, but the\r\nbill was laid on the table.\r\n\r\nAfter General Taylor’s election Mr. Lincoln had the distribution of\r\nFederal patronage in his own Congressional district, and this added much\r\nto his political importance, although it was a ceaseless source of worry\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLINES A HIGH OFFICE.\r\n\r\nJust before the close of his term in Congress Mr. Lincoln was an\r\napplicant for the office of Commissioner of the General Land Office, but\r\nwas unsuccessful. He had been such a factor in General Taylor’s election\r\nthat the administration thought something was due him, and after\r\nhis return to Illinois he was called to Washington and offered the\r\nGovernorship of the Territory of Oregon. It is likely he would have\r\naccepted this had not Mrs. Lincoln put her foot down with an emphatic\r\nno.\r\n\r\nHe declined a partnership with a well-known Chicago lawyer and returning\r\nto his Springfield home resumed the practice of law.\r\n\r\nFrom this time until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, which\r\nopened the way for the admission of slavery into the territories, Mr.\r\nLincoln devoted himself more industriously than ever to the practice of\r\nlaw, and during those five years he was probably a greater student than\r\nhe had ever been before. His partner, W. H. Herndon, has told of the\r\nchanges that took place in the courts and in the methods of practice\r\nwhile Mr. Lincoln was away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AS A LAWYER.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to active practice he saw at once that the courts\r\nhad grown more learned and dignified and that the bar relied more upon\r\nmethod and system and a knowledge of the statute law than upon the stump\r\nspeech method of early days.\r\n\r\nMr. Herndon tells us that Lincoln would lie in bed and read by candle\r\nlight, sometimes until two o’clock in the morning, while his famous\r\ncolleagues, Davis, Logan, Swett, Edwards and Herndon, were soundly and\r\nsometimes loudly sleeping. He read and reread the statutes and books of\r\npractice, devoured Shakespeare, who was always a favorite of his, and\r\nstudied Euclid so diligently that he could easily demonstrate all the\r\npropositions contained in the six books.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln detested office work. He left all that to his partner. He\r\ndisliked to draw up legal papers or to write letters. The firm of which\r\nhe was a member kept no books. When either Lincoln or Herndon received\r\na fee they divided the money then and there. If his partner were not in\r\nthe office at the time Mr. Lincoln would wrap up half of the fee in a\r\nsheet of paper, on which he would write, “Herndon’s half,” giving the\r\nname of the case, and place it in his partner’s desk.\r\n\r\nBut in court, arguing a case, pleading to the jury and laying down the\r\nlaw, Lincoln was in his element. Even when he had a weak case he was a\r\nstrong antagonist, and when he had right and justice on his side, as he\r\nnearly always had, no one could beat him.\r\n\r\nHe liked an outdoor life, hence he was fond of riding the circuit. He\r\nenjoyed the company of other men, liked discussion and argument, loved\r\nto tell stories and to hear them, laughing as heartily at his own\r\nstories as he did at those that were told to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELLING STORIES ON THE CIRCUIT.\r\n\r\nThe court circuit in those days was the scene of many a story-telling\r\njoust, in which Lincoln was always the chief. Frequently he would sit up\r\nuntil after midnight reeling off story after story, each one followed\r\nby roars of laughter that could be heard all over the country tavern,\r\nin which the story-telling group was gathered. Every type of character\r\nwould be represented in these groups, from the learned judge on the\r\nbench down to the village loafer.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s favorite attitude was to sit with his long legs propped up on\r\nthe rail of the stove, or with his feet against the wall, and thus he\r\nwould sit for hours entertaining a crowd, or being entertained.\r\n\r\nOne circuit judge was so fond of Lincoln’s stories that he often would\r\nsit up until midnight listening to them, and then declare that he had\r\nlaughed so much he believed his ribs were shaken loose.\r\n\r\nThe great success of Abraham Lincoln as a trial lawyer was due to a\r\nnumber of facts. He would not take a case if he believed that the law\r\nand justice were on the other side. When he addressed a jury he made\r\nthem feel that he only wanted fair play and justice. He did not talk\r\nover their heads, but got right down to a friendly tone such as we use\r\nin ordinary conversation, and talked at them, appealing to their honesty\r\nand common sense.\r\n\r\nAnd making his argument plain by telling a story or two that brought the\r\nmatter clearly within their understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen he did not know the law in a particular case he never pretended to\r\nknow it. If there were no precedents to cover a case he would state his\r\nside plainly and fairly; he would tell the jury what he believed was\r\nright for them to do, and then conclude with his favorite expression,\r\n“it seems to me that this ought to be the law.”\r\n\r\nSome time before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise a lawyer friend\r\nsaid to him: “Lincoln, the time is near at hand when we shall have to be\r\nall Abolitionists or all Democrats.”\r\n\r\n“When that time comes my mind is made up,” he replied, “for I believe\r\nthe slavery question never can be compromised.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LION IS AROUSED TO ACTION.\r\n\r\nWhile Lincoln took a mild interest in politics, he was not a candidate\r\nfor office, except as a presidential elector, from the time of leaving\r\nCongress until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. This repeal\r\nLegislation was the work of Lincoln’s political antagonist, Stephen A.\r\nDouglas, and aroused Mr. Lincoln to action as the lion is roused by some\r\nfoe worthy of his great strength and courage.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas argued that the true intent and meaning of the act was not\r\nto legislate slavery into any territory or state, nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people perfectly free to form and regulate\r\ntheir domestic institutions in their own way.\r\n\r\n“Douglas’ argument amounts to this,” said Mr. Lincoln, “that if any one\r\nman chooses to enslave another no third man shall be allowed to object.”\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of Congress Mr. Douglas returned to Illinois and\r\nbegan to defend his action in the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.\r\nHis most important speech was made at Springfield, and Mr. Lincoln was\r\nselected to answer it. That speech alone was sufficient to make Mr.\r\nLincoln the leader of anti-Slavery sentiment in the West, and some of\r\nthe men who heard it declared that it was the greatest speech he ever\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nWith the repeal of the Missouri Compromise the Whig party began to break\r\nup, the majority of its members who were pronounced Abolitionists began\r\nto form the nucleus of the Republican party. Before this party was\r\nformed, however, Mr. Lincoln was induced to follow Douglas around the\r\nState and reply to him, but after one meeting at Peoria, where they both\r\nspoke, they entered into an agreement to return to their homes and make\r\nno more speeches during the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEKS A SEAT IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln made no secret at this time of his ambition to represent\r\nIllinois in the United States Senate. Against his protest he was\r\nnominated and elected to the Legislature, but resigned his seat. His\r\nold rival, James Shields, with whom he was once near to a duel, was then\r\nsenator, and his term was to expire the following year.\r\n\r\nA letter, written by Mr. Lincoln to a friend in Paris, Illinois, at this\r\ntime is interesting and significant. He wrote:\r\n\r\n“I have a suspicion that a Whig has been elected to the Legislature from\r\nEagar. If this is not so, why, then, ‘nix cum arous;’ but if it is\r\nso, then could you not make a mark with him for me for United States\r\nsenator? I really have some chance.”\r\n\r\nAnother candidate besides Mr. Lincoln was seeking the seat in the\r\nUnited States Senate, soon to be vacated by Mr. Shields. This was Lyman\r\nTrumbull, an anti-slavery Democrat. When the Legislature met it was\r\nfound that Mr. Lincoln lacked five votes of an election, while Mr.\r\nTrumbull had but five supporters. After several ballots Mr. Lincoln\r\nfeared that Trumbull’s votes would be given to a Democratic candidate\r\nand he determined to sacrifice himself for the principle at stake.\r\nAccordingly he instructed his friends in the Legislature to vote for\r\nJudge Trumbull, which they did, resulting in Trumbull’s election.\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists in the West had become very radical in their views,\r\nand did not hesitate to talk of opposing the extension of slavery by\r\nthe use of force if necessary. Mr. Lincoln, on the other hand, was\r\nconservative and counseled moderation. In the meantime many outrages,\r\ngrowing out of the extension of slavery, were being perpetrated on the\r\nborders of Kansas and Missouri, and they no doubt influenced Mr. Lincoln\r\nto take a more radical stand against the slavery question.\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred at this time which had great effect in this\r\ndirection. The negro son of a colored woman in Springfield had gone\r\nSouth to work. He was born free, but did not have his free papers with\r\nhim. He was arrested and would have been sold into slavery to pay his\r\nprison expenses, had not Mr. Lincoln and some friends purchased his\r\nliberty. Previous to this Mr. Lincoln had tried to secure the boy’s\r\nrelease through the Governor of Illinois, but the Governor informed him\r\nthat nothing could be done.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Mr. Lincoln rose to his full height and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Governor, I’ll make the ground in this country too hot for the foot of\r\na slave, whether you have the legal power to secure the release of this\r\nboy or not.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPS TO ORGANIZE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\nThe year after Mr. Trumbull’s election to the Senate the Republican\r\nparty was formally organized. A state convention of that party was\r\ncalled to meet at Bloomington May 29, 1856. The call for this convention\r\nwas signed by many Springfield Whigs, and among the names was that of\r\nAbraham Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln’s name had been signed to the call by his\r\nlaw partner, but when he was informed of this action he endorsed it\r\nfully. Among the famous men who took part in this convention were\r\nAbraham Lincoln, Lyman Trumbull, David Davis, Leonard Swett, Richard\r\nYates, Norman, B. Judd and Owen Lovejoy, the Alton editor, whose life,\r\nlike Lincoln’s, finally paid the penalty for his Abolition views. The\r\nparty nominated for Governor, Wm. H. Bissell, a veteran of the Mexican\r\nWar, and adopted a platform ringing with anti-slavery sentiment.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was the greatest power in the campaign that followed. He was\r\none of the Fremont Presidential electors, and he went to work with all\r\nhis might to spread the new party gospel and make votes for the old\r\n“Path-Finder of the Rocky Mountains.”\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident followed close after the Bloomington convention. A\r\nmeeting was called at Springfield to ratify the action at Bloomington.\r\nOnly three persons attended--Mr. Lincoln, his law partner and a man\r\nnamed John Paine. Mr. Lincoln made a speech to his colleagues, in which,\r\namong other things, he said: “While all seems dead, the age itself is\r\nnot. It liveth as sure as our Maker liveth.”\r\n\r\nIn this campaign Mr. Lincoln was in general demand not only in his own\r\nstate, but in Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin as well.\r\n\r\nThe result of that Presidential campaign was the election of Buchanan\r\nas President, Bissell as Governor, leaving Mr. Lincoln the undisputed\r\nleader of the new party. Hence it was that two years later he was the\r\ninevitable man to oppose Judge Douglas in the campaign for United States\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAIL-SPLITTER vs. THE LITTLE GIANT.\r\n\r\nNo record of Abraham Lincoln’s career would be complete without the\r\nstory of the memorable joint debates between the “Rail-Splitter of\r\nthe Sangamon Valley” and the “Little Giant.” The opening lines in Mr.\r\nLincoln’s speech to the Republican Convention were not only prophetic\r\nof the coming rebellion, but they clearly made the issue between the\r\nRepublican and Democratic parties for two Presidential campaigns to\r\nfollow. The memorable sentences were as follows:\r\n\r\n“A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this Government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect\r\nthe Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do\r\nexpect it will cease to be divided. It will become all the one thing\r\nor the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further\r\nspread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief\r\nthat it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will\r\npush it forward till it becomes alike lawful in all the states, old as\r\nwell as new, North as well as South.”\r\n\r\nIt is universally conceded that this speech contained the most important\r\nutterances of Mr. Lincoln’s life.\r\n\r\nPrevious to its delivery, the Democratic convention had endorsed Mr.\r\nDouglas for re-election to the Senate, and the Republican convention had\r\nresolved that “Abraham Lincoln is our first and only choice for\r\nUnited States Senator, to fill the vacancy about to be created by the\r\nexpiration of Mr. Douglas’ term of office.”\r\n\r\nBefore Judge Douglas had made many speeches in this Senatorial campaign,\r\nMr. Lincoln challenged him to a joint debate, which was accepted, and\r\nseven memorable meetings between these two great leaders followed.\r\nThe places and dates were: Ottawa, August 21st; Freeport, August 27th;\r\nJonesboro, September 15th; Charleston, September 18th; Galesburg,\r\nOctober 7th; Quincy, October 13th; and Alton, October 15th.\r\n\r\nThe debates not only attracted the attention of the people in the state\r\nof Illinois, but aroused an interest throughout the whole country equal\r\nto that of a Presidential election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWERE LIKE CROWDS AT A CIRCUS.\r\n\r\nAll the meetings of the joint debate were attended by immense crowds\r\nof people. They came in all sorts of vehicles, on horseback, and many\r\nwalked weary miles on foot to hear these two great leaders discuss the\r\nissues of the campaign. There had never been political meetings held\r\nunder such unusual conditions as these, and there probably never will\r\nbe again. At every place the speakers were met by great crowds of their\r\nfriends and escorted to the platforms in the open air where the debates\r\nwere held. The processions that escorted the speakers were most unique.\r\nThey carried flags and banners and were preceded by bands of music. The\r\npeople discharged cannons when they had them, and, when they did not,\r\nblacksmiths’ anvils were made to take their places.\r\n\r\nOftentimes a part of the escort would be mounted, and in most of the\r\nprocessions were chariots containing young ladies representing the\r\ndifferent states of the Union designated by banners they carried.\r\nBesides the bands, there was usually vocal music. Patriotic songs were\r\nthe order of the day, the “Star-Spangled Banner” and “Hail Columbia”\r\n being great favorites.\r\n\r\nSo far as the crowds were concerned, these joint debates took on the\r\nappearance of a circus day, and this comparison was strengthened by the\r\nsale of lemonade, fruit, melons and confectionery on the outskirts of\r\nthe gatherings.\r\n\r\nAt Ottawa, after his speech, Mr. Lincoln was carried around on the\r\nshoulders of his enthusiastic supporters, who did not put him down until\r\nthey reached the place where he was to spend the night.\r\n\r\nIn the joint debates, each of the candidates asked the other a series\r\nof questions. Judge Douglas’ replies to Mr. Lincoln’s shrewd questions\r\nhelped Douglas to win the Senatorial election, but they lost him the\r\nsupport of the South in the campaign for President two years thereafter.\r\nMr. Lincoln was told when he framed his questions that if Douglas\r\nanswered them in the way it was believed he would that the answers would\r\nmake him Senator.\r\n\r\n“That may be,” said Mr. Lincoln, “but if he takes that shoot he never\r\ncan be President.”\r\n\r\nThe prophecy was correct. Mr. Douglas was elected Senator, but two years\r\nlater only carried one state--Missouri--for President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS BUCKEYE CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of this canvass, Mr. Lincoln again devoted himself to\r\nthe practice of his profession, but he was destined to remain but a\r\nshort time in retirement. In the fall of 1859 Mr. Douglas went to Ohio\r\nto stump the state for his friend, Mr. Pugh, the Democratic candidate\r\nfor Governor. The Ohio Republicans at once asked Mr. Lincoln to come to\r\nthe state and reply to the “Little Giant.” He accepted the invitation\r\nand made two masterly speeches in the campaign. In one of them,\r\ndelivered at Cincinnati, he prophesied the outcome of the rebellion if\r\nthe Southern people attempted to divide the Union by force.\r\n\r\nAddressing himself particularly to the Kentuckians in the audience, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“I have told you what we mean to do. I want to know, now, when that\r\nthing takes place, what do you mean to do? I often hear it intimated\r\nthat you mean to divide the Union whenever a Republican, or anything\r\nlike it, is elected President of the United States. [A Voice--“That is\r\nso.”] ‘That is so,’ one of them says; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian? [A\r\nVoice--“He is a Douglas man.”] Well, then, I want to know what you are\r\ngoing to do with your half of it?\r\n\r\n“Are you going to split the Ohio down through, and push your half off\r\na piece? Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous\r\nfellows? Or are you going to build up a wall some way between your\r\ncountry, and ours, by which that movable property of yours can’t come\r\nover here any more, to the danger of your losing it? Do you think\r\nyou can better yourselves on that subject by leaving us here under no\r\nobligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property\r\nthat come hither?\r\n\r\n“You have divided the Union because we would not do right with you, as\r\nyou think, upon that subject; when we cease to be under obligations to\r\ndo anything for you, how much better off do you think you will be? Will\r\nyou make war upon us and kill us all? Why, gentlemen, I think you are\r\nas gallant and as brave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a\r\ngood cause, man for man, as any other people living; that you have shown\r\nyourselves capable of this upon various occasions; but, man for man, you\r\nare not better than we are, and there are not so many of you as there\r\nare of us.\r\n\r\n“You will never make much of a hand at whipping us. If we were fewer in\r\nnumbers than you, I think that you could whip us; if we were equal, it\r\nwould likely be a drawn battle; but, being inferior in numbers, you will\r\nmake nothing by attempting to master us.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps I have addressed myself as long, or longer, to the\r\nKentuckians than I ought to have done, inasmuch as I have said that,\r\nwhatever course you take, we intend in the end to beat you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST VISIT TO NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nLater in the year Mr. Lincoln also spoke in Kansas, where he was\r\nreceived with great enthusiasm, and in February of the following year\r\nhe made his great speech in Cooper Union, New York, to an immense\r\ngathering, presided over by William Cullen Bryant, the poet, who was\r\nthen editor of the New York Evening Post. There was great curiosity to\r\nsee the Western rail-splitter who had so lately met the famous “Little\r\nGiant” of the West in debate, and Mr. Lincoln’s speech was listened to\r\nby many of the ablest men in the East.\r\n\r\nThis speech won for him many supporters in the Presidential campaign\r\nthat followed, for his hearers at once recognized his wonderful ability\r\nto deal with the questions then uppermost in the public mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Convention of 1860 met in Chicago, May 16, in\r\nan immense building called the “Wigwam.” The leading candidates for\r\nPresident were William H. Seward of New York and Abraham Lincoln of\r\nIllinois. Among others spoken of were Salmon P. Chase of Ohio and Simon\r\nCameron of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn the first ballot for President, Mr. Seward received one hundred\r\nand seventy-three and one-half votes; Mr. Lincoln, one hundred and two\r\nvotes, the others scattering. On the first ballot, Vermont had divided\r\nher vote, but on the second the chairman of the Vermont delegation\r\nannounced: “Vermont casts her ten votes for the young giant of the\r\nWest--Abraham Lincoln.”\r\n\r\nThis was the turning point in the convention toward Mr. Lincoln’s\r\nnomination. The second ballot resulted: Seward, one hundred and\r\neighty-four and one-half; Lincoln, one hundred and eighty-one. On the\r\nthird ballot, Mr. Lincoln received two hundred and thirty votes. One and\r\none-half votes more would nominate him. Before the ballot was announced,\r\nOhio made a change of four votes in favor of Mr. Lincoln, making him the\r\nnominee for President.\r\n\r\nOther states tried to follow Ohio’s example, but it was a long time\r\nbefore any of the delegates could make themselves heard. Cannons planted\r\non top of the wigwam were roaring and booming; the large crowd in the\r\nwigwam and the immense throng outside were cheering at the top of their\r\nlungs, while bands were playing victorious airs.\r\n\r\nWhen order had been restored, it was announced that on the third ballot\r\nAbraham Lincoln of Illinois had received three hundred and fifty-four\r\nvotes and was nominated by the Republican party to the office of\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln heard the news of his nomination while sitting in a\r\nnewspaper office in Springfield, and hurried home to tell his wife.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Lincoln had predicted, Judge Douglas’ position on slavery in the\r\nterritories lost him the support of the South, and when the Democratic\r\nconvention met at Charleston, the slave-holding states forced the\r\nnomination of John C. Breckinridge. A considerable number of people who\r\ndid not agree with either party nominated John Bell of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nIn the election which followed, Mr. Lincoln carried all of the free\r\nstates, except New Jersey, which was divided between himself and\r\nDouglas; Breckinridge carried all the slave states, except Kentucky,\r\nTennessee and Virginia, which went for Bell, and Missouri gave its vote\r\nto Douglas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nThe election was scarcely over before it was evident that the Southern\r\nStates did not intend to abide by the result, and that a conspiracy was\r\non foot to divide the Union. Before the Presidential election even, the\r\nSecretary of War in President Buchanan’s Cabinet had removed one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand muskets from Government armories in the North and\r\nsent them to Government armories in the South.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Lincoln had prepared his inaugural address, South Carolina,\r\nwhich took the lead in the secession movement, had declared through her\r\nLegislature her separation from the Union. Before Mr. Lincoln took his\r\nseat, other Southern States had followed the example of South Carolina,\r\nand a convention had been held at Montgomery, Alabama, which had elected\r\nJefferson Davis President of the new Confederacy, and Alexander H.\r\nStevens, of Georgia, Vice-President.\r\n\r\nSouthern men in the Cabinet, Senate and House had resigned their seats\r\nand gone home, and Southern States were demanding that Southern forts\r\nand Government property in their section should be turned over to them.\r\n\r\nBetween his election and inauguration, Mr. Lincoln remained silent,\r\nreserving his opinions and a declaration of his policy for his inaugural\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Lincoln’s departure from Springfield for Washington, threats\r\nhad been freely made that he would never reach the capital alive, and,\r\nin fact, a conspiracy was then on foot to take his life in the city of\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln left Springfield on February 11th, in company with his wife\r\nand three sons, his brother-in-law, Dr. W. S. Wallace; David Davis,\r\nNorman B. Judd, Elmer E. Elsworth, Ward H. Lamon, Colonel E. V. Sunder\r\nof the United States Army, and the President’s two secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD-BYE TO THE OLD FOLK.\r\n\r\nEarly in February, before leaving for Washington, Mr. Lincoln slipped\r\naway from Springfield and paid a visit to his aged step-mother in Coles\r\ncounty. He also paid a visit to the unmarked grave of his father and\r\nordered a suitable stone to mark the spot.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Springfield, he made an address to his fellow-townsmen,\r\nin which he displayed sincere sorrow at parting from them.\r\n\r\n“Friends,” he said, “no one who has never been placed in a like position\r\ncan understand my feelings at this hour, nor the oppressive sadness I\r\nfeel at this parting. For more than a quarter of a century I have lived\r\namong you, and during all that time I have received nothing but kindness\r\nat your hands. Here I have lived from my youth until now I am an old\r\nman. Here the most sacred ties of earth were assumed. Here all my\r\nchildren were born, and here one of them lies buried.\r\n\r\n“To you, dear friends, I owe all that I have, all that I am. All the\r\nstrange, checkered past seems to crowd now upon my mind. To-day I leave\r\nyou. I go to assume a task more difficult than that which devolved upon\r\nWashington. Unless the great God who assisted him shall be with and aid\r\nme, I must fail; but if the same omniscient mind and almighty arm that\r\ndirected and protected him shall guide and support me, I shall not\r\nfail--I shall succeed. Let us all pray that the God of our fathers may\r\nnot forsake us now.\r\n\r\n“To Him I commend you all. Permit me to ask that with equal sincerity\r\nand faith you will invoke His wisdom and guidance for me. With these\r\nwords I must leave you, for how long I know not. Friends, one and all, I\r\nmust now bid you an affectionate farewell.”\r\n\r\nThe journey from Springfield to Philadelphia was a continuous ovation\r\nfor Mr. Lincoln. Crowds assembled to meet him at the various places\r\nalong the way, and he made them short speeches, full of humor and good\r\nfeeling. At Harrisburg, Pa., the party was met by Allan Pinkerton, who\r\nknew of the plot in Baltimore to take the life of Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “SECRET PASSAGE” TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThroughout his entire life, Abraham Lincoln’s physical courage was as\r\ngreat and superb as his moral courage. When Mr. Pinkerton and Mr.\r\nJudd urged the President-elect to leave for Washington that night, he\r\npositively refused to do it. He said he had made an engagement to assist\r\nat a flag raising in the forenoon of the next day and to show himself to\r\nthe people of Harrisburg in the afternoon, and that he intended to keep\r\nboth engagements.\r\n\r\nAt Philadelphia the Presidential party was met by Mr. Seward’s son,\r\nFrederick, who had been sent to warn Mr. Lincoln of the plot against his\r\nlife. Mr. Judd, Mr. Pinkerton and Mr. Lamon figured out a plan to take\r\nMr. Lincoln through Baltimore between midnight and daybreak, when the\r\nwould-be assassins would not be expecting him, and this plan was carried\r\nout so thoroughly that even the conductor on the train did not know the\r\nPresident-elect was on board.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was put into his berth and the curtains drawn. He was\r\nsupposed to be a sick man. When the conductor came around, Mr. Pinkerton\r\nhanded him the “sick man’s” ticket and he passed on without question.\r\n\r\nWhen the train reached Baltimore, at half-past three o’clock in the\r\nmorning, it was met by one of Mr. Pinkerton’s detectives, who reported\r\nthat everything was “all right,” and in a short time the party was\r\nspeeding on to the national capital, where rooms had been engaged for\r\nMr. Lincoln and his guard at Willard’s Hotel.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln always regretted this “secret passage” to Washington, for\r\nit was repugnant to a man of his high courage. He had agreed to the plan\r\nsimply because all of his friends urged it as the best thing to do.\r\n\r\nNow that all the facts are known, it is assured that his friends were\r\nright, and that there never was a moment from the day he crossed the\r\nMaryland line until his assassination that his life was not in danger,\r\nand was only saved as long as it was by the constant vigilance of those\r\nwho were guarding him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS ELOQUENT INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful eloquence of Abraham Lincoln--clear, sincere,\r\nnatural--found grand expression in his first inaugural address, in which\r\nhe not only outlined his policy toward the States in rebellion, but made\r\nthat beautiful and eloquent plea for conciliation. The closing sentences\r\nof Mr. Lincoln’s first inaugural address deservedly take rank with his\r\nGettysburg speech:\r\n\r\n“In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen,” he said, “and not\r\nin mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not\r\nassail you.\r\n\r\n“You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You\r\nhave no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government, while I\r\nshall have the most solemn one to ‘preserve, protect and defend’ it.\r\n\r\n“I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\r\nenemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds\r\nof affection.\r\n\r\n“The mystic cord of memory, stretching from every battle-field and\r\npatriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad\r\nland, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as\r\nsurely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLLOWS PRECEDENT OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nIn selecting his Cabinet, Mr. Lincoln, consciously or unconsciously,\r\nfollowed a precedent established by Washington, of selecting men of\r\nalmost opposite opinions. His Cabinet was composed of William H. Seward\r\nof New York, Secretary of State; Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury; Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania, Secretary of War; Gideon E.\r\nWelles of Connecticut, Secretary of the Navy; Caleb B. Smith of\r\nIndiana, Secretary of the Interior; Montgomery Blair of Maryland,\r\nPostmaster-General; Edward Bates of Missouri, Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase, although an anti-slavery leader, was a States-Rights Federal\r\nRepublican, while Mr. Seward was a Whig, without having connected\r\nhimself with the anti-slavery movement.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase and Mr. Seward, the leading men of Mr. Lincoln’s Cabinet, were\r\nas widely apart and antagonistic in their views as were Jefferson, the\r\nDemocrat, and Hamilton, the Federalist, the two leaders in Washington’s\r\nCabinet. But in bringing together these two strong men as his chief\r\nadvisers, both of whom had been rival candidates for the Presidency, Mr.\r\nLincoln gave another example of his own greatness and self-reliance, and\r\nput them both in a position to render greater service to the Government\r\nthan they could have done, probably, as President.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had been in office little more than five weeks when the War\r\nof the Rebellion began by the firing on Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREATER DIPLOMAT THAN SEWARD.\r\n\r\nThe War of the Rebellion revealed to the people--in fact, to the whole\r\nworld--the many sides of Abraham Lincoln’s character. It showed him as\r\na real ruler of men--not a ruler by the mere power of might, but by\r\nthe power of a great brain. In his Cabinet were the ablest men in the\r\ncountry, yet they all knew that Lincoln was abler than any of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward, the Secretary of State, was a man famed in statesmanship\r\nand diplomacy. During the early stages of the Civil War, when France\r\nand England were seeking an excuse to interfere and help the Southern\r\nConfederacy, Mr. Seward wrote a letter to our minister in London,\r\nCharles Francis Adams, instructing him concerning the attitude of\r\nthe Federal government on the question of interference, which would\r\nundoubtedly have brought about a war with England if Abraham Lincoln had\r\nnot corrected and amended the letter. He did this, too, without yielding\r\na point or sacrificing in any way his own dignity or that of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN A GREAT GENERAL.\r\n\r\nThroughout the four years of war, Mr. Lincoln spent a great deal of time\r\nin the War Department, receiving news from the front and conferring with\r\nSecretary of War Stanton concerning military affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s War Secretary, Edwin M. Stanton, who had succeeded\r\nSimon Cameron, was a man of wonderful personality and iron will. It is\r\ngenerally conceded that no other man could have managed the great War\r\nSecretary so well as Lincoln. Stanton had his way in most matters,\r\nbut when there was an important difference of opinion he always found\r\nLincoln was the master.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Lincoln’s communications to the generals in the field\r\nwere oftener in the nature of suggestions than positive orders, every\r\nmilitary leader recognized Mr. Lincoln’s ability in military operations.\r\nIn the early stages of the war, Mr. Lincoln followed closely every plan\r\nand movement of McClellan, and the correspondence between them proves\r\nMr. Lincoln to have been far the abler general of the two. He kept close\r\nwatch of Burnside, too, and when he gave the command of the Army of the\r\nPotomac to “Fighting Joe” Hooker he also gave that general some fatherly\r\ncounsel and advice which was of great benefit to him as a commander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT.\r\n\r\nIt was not until General Grant had been made Commander-in-Chief that\r\nPresident Lincoln felt he had at last found a general who did not\r\nneed much advice. He was the first to recognize that Grant was a great\r\nmilitary leader, and when he once felt sure of this fact nothing could\r\nshake his confidence in that general. Delegation after delegation called\r\nat the White House and asked for Grant’s removal from the head of the\r\narmy. They accused him of being a butcher, a drunkard, a man without\r\nsense or feeling.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln listened to all of these attacks, but he always had\r\nan apt answer to silence Grant’s enemies. Grant was doing what Lincoln\r\nwanted done from the first--he was fighting and winning victories, and\r\nvictories are the only things that count in war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR FREEING THE SLAVES.\r\n\r\nThe crowning act of Lincoln’s career as President was the emancipation\r\nof the slaves. All of his life he had believed in gradual emancipation,\r\nbut all of his plans contemplated payment to the slaveholders. While he\r\nhad always been opposed to slavery, he did not take any steps to use it\r\nas a war measure until about the middle of 1862. His chief object was to\r\npreserve the Union.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Horace Greeley that if he could save the Union without\r\nfreeing any of the slaves he would do it; that if he could save it by\r\nfreeing some and leaving the others in slavery he would do that; that if\r\nit became necessary to free all the slaves in order to save the Union he\r\nwould take that course.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery men were continually urging Mr. Lincoln to set the\r\nslaves free, but he paid no attention to their petitions and demands\r\nuntil he felt that emancipation would help him to preserve the Union of\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the Union cause grew darker and darker in 1862, and Mr.\r\nLincoln began to think, as he expressed it, that he must “change\r\nhis tactics or lose the game.” Accordingly he decided to issue the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation as soon as the Union army won a substantial\r\nvictory. The battle of Antietam, on September 17, gave him the\r\nopportunity he sought. He told Secretary Chase that he had made a\r\nsolemn vow before God that if General Lee should be driven back from\r\nPennsylvania he would crown the result by a declaration of freedom to\r\nthe slaves.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of that month he issued a proclamation stating\r\nthat at the end of one hundred days he would issue another proclamation\r\ndeclaring all slaves within any State or Territory to be forever free,\r\nwhich was done in the form of the famous Emancipation Proclamation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARD TO REFUSE PARDONS.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of the war and in his purpose to maintain the Union,\r\nAbraham Lincoln exhibited a will of iron and determination that could\r\nnot be shaken, but in his daily contact with the mothers, wives and\r\ndaughters begging for the life of some soldier who had been condemned to\r\ndeath for desertion or sleeping on duty he was as gentle and weak as a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult matter for him to refuse a pardon if the slightest\r\nexcuse could be found for granting it.\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton and the commanding generals were loud in declaring\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln would destroy the discipline of the army by his\r\nwholesale pardoning of condemned soldiers, but when we come to examine\r\nthe individual cases we find that Lincoln was nearly always right, and\r\nwhen he erred it was always on the side of humanity.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years of the long struggle for the preservation of\r\nthe Union, Mr. Lincoln kept “open shop,” as he expressed it, where\r\nthe general public could always see him and make known their wants and\r\ncomplaints. Even the private soldier was not denied admittance to the\r\nPresident’s private office, and no request or complaint was too small or\r\ntrivial to enlist his sympathy and interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FUN-LOVING AND HUMOR-LOVING MAN.\r\n\r\nIt was once said of Shakespeare that the great mind that conceived the\r\ntragedies of “Hamlet,” “Macbeth,” etc., would have lost its reason if it\r\nhad not found vent in the sparkling humor of such comedies as “The Merry\r\nWives of Windsor” and “The Comedy of Errors.”\r\n\r\nThe great strain on the mind of Abraham Lincoln produced by four years\r\nof civil war might likewise have overcome his reason had it not found\r\nvent in the yarns and stories he constantly told. No more fun-loving or\r\nhumor-loving man than Abraham Lincoln ever lived. He enjoyed a joke\r\neven when it was on himself, and probably, while he got his greatest\r\nenjoyment from telling stories, he had a keen appreciation of the humor\r\nin those that were told him.\r\n\r\nHis favorite humorous writer was David R. Locke, better known as\r\n“Petroleum V. Nasby,” whose political satires were quite famous in their\r\nday. Nearly every prominent man who has written his recollections of\r\nLincoln has told how the President, in the middle of a conversation on\r\nsome serious subject, would suddenly stop and ask his hearer if he ever\r\nread the Nasby letters.\r\n\r\nThen he would take from his desk a pamphlet containing the letters and\r\nproceed to read them, laughing heartily at all the good points they\r\ncontained. There is probably no better evidence of Mr. Lincoln’s love of\r\nhumor and appreciation of it than his letter to Nasby, in which he said:\r\n“For the ability to write these things I would gladly trade places with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was re-elected President in 1864. His opponent on the\r\nDemocratic ticket was General George B. McClellan, whose command of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac had been so unsatisfactory at the beginning of the\r\nwar. Mr. Lincoln’s election was almost unanimous, as McClellan carried\r\nbut three States--Delaware, Kentucky and New Jersey.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, in a telegram of congratulation, said that it was “a\r\nvictory worth more to the country than a battle won.”\r\n\r\nThe war was fast drawing to a close. The black war clouds were breaking\r\nand rolling away. Sherman had made his famous march to the sea.\r\nThrough swamp and ravine, Grant was rapidly tightening the lines\r\naround Richmond. Thomas had won his title of the “Rock of Chickamauga.”\r\n Sheridan had won his spurs as the great modern cavalry commander, and\r\nhad cleaned out the Shenandoah Valley. Sherman was coming back from his\r\nfamous march to join Grant at Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe Confederacy was without a navy. The Kearsarge had sunk the Alabama,\r\nand Farragut had fought and won the famous victory in Mobile Bay. It was\r\ncertain that Lee would soon have to evacuate Richmond only to fall into\r\nthe hands of Grant.\r\n\r\nLincoln saw the dawn of peace. When he came to deliver his second\r\ninaugural address, it contained no note of victory, no exultation over\r\na fallen foe. On the contrary, it breathed the spirit of brotherly love\r\nand of prayer for an early peace: “With malice toward none, with charity\r\nfor all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,\r\nlet us finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to\r\ncare for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his\r\norphans, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting\r\npeace among ourselves and with all nations.”\r\n\r\nNot long thereafter, General Lee evacuated Richmond with about half of\r\nhis original army, closely pursued by Grant. The boys in blue overtook\r\ntheir brothers in gray at Appomattox Court House, and there, beneath the\r\nwarm rays of an April sun, the great Confederate general made his final\r\nsurrender. The war was over, the American flag was floated over all the\r\nterritory of the United States, and peace was now a reality. Mr. Lincoln\r\nvisited Richmond and the final scenes of the war and then returned to\r\nWashington to carry out his announced plan of “binding up the nation’s\r\nwounds.”\r\n\r\nHe had now reached the climax of his career and touched the highest\r\npoint of his greatness. His great task was over, and the heavy burden\r\nthat had so long worn upon his heart was lifted.\r\n\r\nWhile the whole nation was rejoicing over the return of peace, the\r\nSaviour of the Union was stricken down by the hand of an assassin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNINGS OF HIS TRAGIC DEATH.\r\n\r\nFrom early youth, Mr. Lincoln had presentiments that he would die a\r\nviolent death, or, rather, that his final days would be marked by\r\nsome great tragic event. From the time of his first election to the\r\nPresidency, his closest friends had tried to make him understand that\r\nhe was in constant danger of assassination, but, notwithstanding his\r\npresentiments, he had such splendid courage that he only laughed at\r\ntheir fears.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months he lived at the Soldiers’ Home, some miles from\r\nWashington, and frequently made the trip between the White House and the\r\nHome without a guard or escort. Secretary of War Stanton and Ward\r\nLamon, Marshal of the District, were almost constantly alarmed over\r\nMr. Lincoln’s carelessness in exposing himself to the danger of\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nThey warned him time and again, and provided suitable body-guards to\r\nattend him. But Mr. Lincoln would often give the guards the slip, and,\r\nmounting his favorite riding horse, “Old Abe,” would set out alone after\r\ndark from the White House for the Soldiers’ Home.\r\n\r\nWhile riding to the Home one night, he was fired upon by some one in\r\nambush, the bullet passing through his high hat. Mr. Lincoln would not\r\nadmit that the man who fired the shot had tried to kill him. He always\r\nattributed it to an accident, and begged his friends to say nothing\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nNow that all the circumstances of the assassination are known, it is\r\nplain that there was a deep-laid and well-conceived plot to kill Mr.\r\nLincoln long before the crime was actually committed. When Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas delivering his second inaugural address on the steps of the Capitol,\r\nan excited individual tried to force his way through the guards in the\r\nbuilding to get on the platform with Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIt was afterward learned that this man was John Wilkes Booth, who\r\nafterwards assassinated Mr. Lincoln in Ford’s Theatre, on the night of\r\nthe 14th of April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AT THE THEATRE.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the theatre had invited the President to witness a\r\nperformance of a new play known as “Our American Cousin,” in which the\r\nfamous actress, Laura Keane, was playing. Mr. Lincoln was particularly\r\nfond of the theatre. He loved Shakespeare’s plays above all others and\r\nnever missed a chance to see the leading Shakespearean actors.\r\n\r\nAs “Our American Cousin” was a new play, the President did not care\r\nparticularly to see it, but as Mrs. Lincoln was anxious to go, he\r\nconsented and accepted the invitation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was in Washington at the time, and as he was extremely\r\nanxious about the personal safety of the President, he reported every\r\nday regularly at the White House. Mr. Lincoln invited General Grant and\r\nhis wife to accompany him and Mrs. Lincoln to the theatre on the night\r\nof the assassination, and the general accepted, but while they were\r\ntalking he received a note from Mrs. Grant saying that she wished to\r\nleave Washington that evening to visit her daughter in Burlington.\r\nGeneral Grant made his excuses to the President and left to accompany\r\nMrs. Grant to the railway station. It afterwards became known that it\r\nwas also a part of the plot to assassinate General Grant, and only Mrs.\r\nGrant’s departure from Washington that evening prevented the attempt\r\nfrom being made.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant afterwards said that as he and Mrs. Grant were riding\r\nalong Pennsylvania avenue to the railway station a horseman rode rapidly\r\nby at a gallop, and, wheeling his horse, rode back, peering into their\r\ncarriage as he passed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant remarked to the general: “That is the very man who sat near\r\nus at luncheon to-day and tried to overhear our conversation. He was so\r\nrude, you remember, as to cause us to leave the dining-room. Here he is\r\nagain, riding after us.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant attributed the action of the man to idle curiosity, but\r\nlearned afterward that the horseman was John Wilkes Booth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMON’S REMARKABLE REQUEST.\r\n\r\nProbably one reason why Mr. Lincoln did not particularly care to go to\r\nthe theatre that night was a sort of half promise he had made to his\r\nfriend and bodyguard, Marshal Lamon. Two days previous he had sent\r\nLamon to Richmond on business connected with a call of a convention for\r\nreconstruction. Before leaving, Mr. Lamon saw Mr. Usher, the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, and asked him to persuade Mr. Lincoln to use more\r\ncaution about his personal safety, and to go out as little as possible\r\nwhile Lamon was absent. Together they went to see Mr. Lincoln, and Lamon\r\nasked the President if he would make him a promise.\r\n\r\n“I think I can venture to say I will,” said Mr. Lincoln. “What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Promise me that you will not go out after night while I am gone,” said\r\nMr. Lamon, “particularly to the theatre.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln turned to Mr. Usher and said: “Usher, this boy is a\r\nmonomaniac on the subject of my safety. I can hear him or hear of\r\nhis being around at all times in the night, to prevent somebody from\r\nmurdering me. He thinks I shall be killed, and we think he is going\r\ncrazy. What does any one want to assassinate me for? If any one wants to\r\ndo so, he can do it any day or night if he is ready to give his life for\r\nmine. It is nonsense.”\r\n\r\nMr. Usher said to Mr. Lincoln that it was well to heed Lamon’s warning,\r\nas he was thrown among people from whom he had better opportunities to\r\nknow about such matters than almost any one.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Lincoln to Lamon, “I promise to do the best I can\r\ntoward it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LINCOLN WAS MURDERED.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of President Lincoln was most carefully planned, even\r\nto the smallest detail. The box set apart for the President’s party was\r\na double one in the second tier at the left of the stage. The box had\r\ntwo doors with spring locks, but Booth had loosened the screws with\r\nwhich they were fastened so that it was impossible to secure them from\r\nthe inside. In one door he had bored a hole with a gimlet, so that he\r\ncould see what was going on inside the box.\r\n\r\nAn employee of the theatre by the name of Spangler, who was an\r\naccomplice of the assassin, had even arranged the seats in the box to\r\nsuit the purposes of Booth.\r\n\r\nOn the fateful night the theatre was packed. The Presidential party\r\narrived a few minutes after nine o’clock, and consisted of the President\r\nand Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Harris and Major Rathbone, daughter and stepson\r\nof Senator Harris of New York. The immense audience rose to its feet and\r\ncheered the President as he passed to his box.\r\n\r\nBooth came into the theatre about ten o’clock. He had not only, planned\r\nto kill the President, but he had also planned to escape into Maryland,\r\nand a swift horse, saddled and ready for the journey, was tied in the\r\nrear of the theatre. For a few minutes he pretended to be interested in\r\nthe performance, and then gradually made his way back to the door of the\r\nPresident’s box.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching there, however, he was confronted by one of the\r\nPresident’s messengers, who had been stationed at the end of the passage\r\nleading to the boxes to prevent any one from intruding. To this man\r\nBooth handed a card saying that the President had sent for him, and was\r\npermitted to enter.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the hallway leading to the boxes, he closed the hall door\r\nand fastened it by a bar prepared for the occasion, so that it was\r\nimpossible to open it from without. Then he quickly entered the box\r\nthrough the right-hand door. The President was sitting in an easy\r\narmchair in the left-hand corner of the box nearest the audience. He\r\nwas leaning on one hand and with the other had hold of a portion of the\r\ndrapery. There was a smile on his face. The other members of the party\r\nwere intently watching the performance on the stage.\r\n\r\nThe assassin carried in his right hand a small silver-mounted derringer\r\npistol and in his left a long double-edged dagger. He placed the pistol\r\njust behind the President’s left ear and fired.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln bent slightly forward and his eyes closed, but in every\r\nother respect his attitude remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe report of the pistol startled Major Rathbone, who sprang to his\r\nfeet. The murderer was then about six feet from the President, and\r\nRathbone grappled with him, but was shaken off. Dropping his pistol,\r\nBooth struck at Rathbone with the dagger and inflicted a severe wound.\r\nThe assassin then placed his left hand lightly on the railing of the box\r\nand jumped to the stage, eight or nine feet below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH BRANDISHES HIS DAGGER AND ESCAPES.\r\n\r\nThe box was draped with the American flag, and, in jumping, Booth’s\r\nspurs caught in the folds, tearing down the flag, the assassin falling\r\nheavily to the stage and spraining his ankle. He arose, however, and\r\nwalked theatrically across the stage, brandished his knife and shouted,\r\n“Sic semper tyrannis!” and then added, “The South is avenged.”\r\n\r\nFor the moment the audience was horrified and incapable of action. One\r\nman only, a lawyer named Stuart, had sufficient presence of mind to leap\r\nupon the stage and attempt to capture the assassin. Booth went to the\r\nrear door of the stage, where his horse was held in readiness for\r\nhim, and, leaping into the saddle, dashed through the streets toward\r\nVirginia. Miss Keane rushed to the President’s box with water and\r\nstimulants, and medical aid was summoned.\r\n\r\nBy this time the audience realized the tragedy that had been enacted,\r\nand then followed a scene such as has never been witnessed in any public\r\ngathering in this country. Women wept, shrieked and fainted; men raved\r\nand swore, and horror was depicted on every face. Before the audience\r\ncould be gotten out of the theatre, horsemen were dashing through the\r\nstreets and the telegraph was carrying the terrible details of the\r\ntragedy throughout the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALT WHITMAN’S DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman, the poet, has sketched in graphic language the scenes of\r\nthat most eventful fourteenth of April. His account of the assassination\r\nhas become historic, and is herewith given:\r\n\r\n“The day (April 14, 1865) seems to have been a pleasant one throughout\r\nthe whole land--the moral atmosphere pleasant, too--the long storm, so\r\ndark, so fratricidal, full of blood and doubt and gloom, over and ended\r\nat last by the sunrise of such an absolute national victory, and utter\r\nbreaking down of secessionism--we almost doubted our senses! Lee had\r\ncapitulated, beneath the apple tree at Appomattox. The other armies, the\r\nflanges of the revolt, swiftly followed.\r\n\r\n“And could it really be, then? Out of all the affairs of this world of\r\nwoe and passion, of failure and disorder and dismay, was there really\r\ncome the confirmed, unerring sign of peace, like a shaft of pure\r\nlight--of rightful rule--of God?\r\n\r\n“But I must not dwell on accessories. The deed hastens. The popular\r\nafternoon paper, the little Evening Star, had scattered all over its\r\nthird page, divided among the advertisements in a sensational manner in\r\na hundred different places:\r\n\r\n“‘The President and his lady will be at the theatre this evening.’\r\n\r\n“Lincoln was fond of the theatre. I have myself seen him there several\r\ntimes. I remember thinking how funny it was that he, the leading actor\r\nin the greatest and stormiest drama known to real history’s stage,\r\nthrough centuries, should sit there and be so completely interested in\r\nthose human jackstraws, moving about with their silly little gestures,\r\nforeign spirit, and flatulent text.\r\n\r\n“So the day, as I say, was propitious. Early herbage, early flowers,\r\nwere out. I remember where I was stopping at the time, the season being\r\nadvanced, there were many lilacs in full bloom.\r\n\r\n“By one of those caprices that enter and give tinge to events without\r\nbeing a part of them, I find myself always reminded of the great tragedy\r\nof this day by the sight and odor of these blossoms. It never fails.\r\n\r\n“On this occasion the theatre was crowded, many ladies in rich and gay\r\ncostumes, officers in their uniforms, many well-known citizens, young\r\nfolks, the usual cluster of gas lights, the usual magnetism of so many\r\npeople, cheerful with perfumes, music of violins and flutes--and over\r\nall, that saturating, that vast, vague wonder, Victory, the nation’s\r\nvictory, the triumph of the Union, filling the air, the thought, the\r\nsense, with exhilaration more than all the perfumes.\r\n\r\n“The President came betimes, and, with his wife, witnessed the play\r\nfrom the large stage boxes of the second tier, two thrown into one,\r\nand profusely draped with the national flag. The acts and scenes of the\r\npiece--one of those singularly witless compositions which have at the\r\nleast the merit of giving entire relief to an audience engaged in mental\r\naction or business excitements and cares during the day, as it makes not\r\nthe slightest call on either the moral, emotional, esthetic or\r\nspiritual nature--a piece in which among other characters, so called, a\r\nYankee--certainly such a one as was never seen, or at least like it\r\never seen in North America, is introduced in England, with a varied\r\nfol-de-rol of talk, plot, scenery, and such phantasmagoria as goes to\r\nmake up a modern popular drama--had progressed perhaps through a couple\r\nof its acts, when, in the midst of this comedy, or tragedy, or non-such,\r\nor whatever it is to be called, and to offset it, or finish it out, as\r\nif in Nature’s and the Great Muse’s mockery of these poor mimics, comes\r\ninterpolated that scene, not really or exactly to be described at all\r\n(for on the many hundreds who were there it seems to this hour to have\r\nleft little but a passing blur, a dream, a blotch)--and yet partially\r\ndescribed as I now proceed to give it:\r\n\r\n“There is a scene in the play, representing the modern parlor, in\r\nwhich two unprecedented ladies are informed by the unprecedented\r\nand impossible Yankee that he is not a man of fortune, and therefore\r\nundesirable for marriage-catching purposes; after which, the comments\r\nbeing finished, the dramatic trio make exit, leaving the stage clear for\r\na moment.\r\n\r\n“There was a pause, a hush, as it were. At this period came the death of\r\nAbraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\n“Great as that was, with all its manifold train circling around it, and\r\nstretching into the future for many a century, in the politics, history,\r\nart, etc., of the New World, in point of fact, the main thing, the\r\nactual murder, transpired with the quiet and simplicity of any commonest\r\noccurrence--the bursting of a bud or pod in the growth of vegetation,\r\nfor instance.\r\n\r\n“Through the general hum following the stage pause, with the change\r\nof positions, etc., came the muffled sound of a pistol shot, which not\r\none-hundredth part of the audience heard at the time--and yet a moment’s\r\nhush--somehow, surely a vague, startled thrill--and then, through the\r\nornamented, draperied, starred and striped space-way of the President’s\r\nbox, a sudden figure, a man, raises himself with hands and feet,\r\nstands a moment on the railing, leaps below to the stage, falls out of\r\nposition, catching his boot heel in the copious drapery (the American\r\nflag), falls on one knee, quickly recovers himself, rises as if nothing\r\nhad happened (he really sprains his ankle, unfelt then)--and the figure,\r\nBooth, the murderer, dressed in plain black broadcloth, bareheaded, with\r\na full head of glossy, raven hair, and his eyes, like some mad animal’s,\r\nflashing with light and resolution, yet with a certain strange calmness\r\nholds aloft in one hand a large knife--walks along not much back of the\r\nfootlights--turns fully towards the audience, his face of statuesque\r\nbeauty, lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with desperation, perhaps\r\ninsanity--launches out in a firm and steady voice the words, ‘Sic\r\nsemper tyrannis’--and then walks with neither slow nor very rapid pace\r\ndiagonally across to the back of the stage, and disappears.\r\n\r\n“(Had not all this terrible scene--making the mimic ones\r\npreposterous--had it not all been rehearsed, in blank, by Booth,\r\nbeforehand?)\r\n\r\n“A moment’s hush, incredulous--a scream--a cry of murder--Mrs. Lincoln\r\nleaning out of the box, with ashy cheeks and lips, with involuntary cry,\r\npointing to the retreating figure, ‘He has killed the President!’\r\n\r\n“And still a moment’s strange, incredulous suspense--and then the\r\ndeluge!--then that mixture of horror, noises, uncertainty--the sound,\r\nsomewhere back, of a horse’s hoofs clattering with speed--the people\r\nburst through chairs and railings, and break them up--that noise adds\r\nto the queerness of the scene--there is inextricable confusion and\r\nterror--women faint--quite feeble persons fall, and are trampled\r\non--many cries of agony are heard--the broad stage suddenly fills\r\nto suffocation with a dense and motley crowd, like some horrible\r\ncarnival--the audience rush generally upon it--at least the strong\r\nmen do--the actors and actresses are there in their play costumes\r\nand painted faces, with mortal fright showing through the\r\nrouge--some trembling, some in tears--the screams and calls, confused\r\ntalk--redoubled, trebled--two or three manage to pass up water from the\r\nstage to the President’s box, others try to clamber up, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n“In the midst of all this the soldiers of the President’s Guard,\r\nwith others, suddenly drawn to the scene, burst in--some two hundred\r\naltogether--they storm the house, through all the tiers, especially the\r\nupper ones--inflamed with fury, literally charging the audience with\r\nfixed bayonets, muskets and pistols, shouting, ‘Clear out! clear out!’\r\n\r\n“Such a wild scene, or a suggestion of it, rather, inside the playhouse\r\nthat night!\r\n\r\n“Outside, too, in the atmosphere of shock and craze, crowds of people\r\nfilled with frenzy, ready to seize any outlet for it, came near\r\ncommitting murder several times on innocent individuals.\r\n\r\n“One such case was particularly exciting. The infuriated crowd, through\r\nsome chance, got started against one man, either for words he uttered,\r\nor perhaps without any cause at all, and were proceeding to hang him\r\nat once to a neighboring lamp-post, when he was rescued by a few heroic\r\npolicemen, who placed him in their midst and fought their way slowly and\r\namid great peril toward the station-house.\r\n\r\n“It was a fitting episode of the whole affair. The crowd rushing\r\nand eddying to and fro, the night, the yells, the pale faces, many\r\nfrightened people trying in vain to extricate themselves, the attacked\r\nman, not yet freed from the jaws of death, looking like a corpse; the\r\nsilent, resolute half-dozen policemen, with no weapons but their little\r\nclubs, yet stern and steady through all those eddying swarms, made,\r\nindeed, a fitting side scene to the grand tragedy of the murder. They\r\ngained the station-house with the protected man, whom they placed in\r\nsecurity for the night, and discharged in the morning.\r\n\r\n“And in the midst of that night pandemonium of senseless hate,\r\ninfuriated soldiers, the audience and the crowd--the stage, and all\r\nits actors and actresses, its paint pots, spangles, gas-light--the\r\nlife-blood from those veins, the best and sweetest of the land, drips\r\nslowly down, and death’s ooze already begins its little bubbles on the\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n“Such, hurriedly sketched, were the accompaniments of the death of\r\nPresident Lincoln. So suddenly, and in murder and horror unsurpassed, he\r\nwas taken from us. But his death was painless.”\r\n\r\nThe assassin’s bullet did not produce instant death, but the President\r\nnever again became conscious. He was carried to a house opposite the\r\ntheatre, where he died the next morning. In the meantime the authorities\r\nhad become aware of the wide-reaching conspiracy, and the capital was in\r\na state of terror.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the President’s assassination, Mr. Seward, Secretary\r\nof State, was attacked while in bed with a broken arm, by Booth’s\r\nfellow-conspirators, and badly wounded.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators had also planned to take the lives of Vice-President\r\nJohnson and Secretary Stanton. Booth had called on Vice-President\r\nJohnson the day before, and, not finding him in, left a card.\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton acted with his usual promptness and courage. During\r\nthe period of excitement he acted as President, and directed the plans\r\nfor the capture of Booth.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, he issued the following reward:\r\n\r\nREWARD OFFERED BY SECRETARY STANTON. War Department, Washington, April\r\n20, 1865. Major-General John A. Dix, New York:\r\n\r\nThe murderer of our late beloved President, Abraham Lincoln, is still at\r\nlarge. Fifty thousand dollars reward will be paid by this Department\r\nfor his apprehension, in addition to any reward offered by municipal\r\nauthorities or State Executives.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five thousand dollars reward will be paid for the apprehension\r\nof G. W. Atzerodt, sometimes called “Port Tobacco,” one of Booth’s\r\naccomplices. Twenty-five thousand dollars reward will be paid for the\r\napprehension of David C. Herold, another of Booth’s accomplices.\r\n\r\nA liberal reward will be paid for any information that shall conduce to\r\nthe arrest of either the above-named criminals or their accomplices.\r\n\r\nAll persons harboring or secreting the said persons, or either of them,\r\nor aiding or assisting their concealment or escape, will be treated\r\nas accomplices in the murder of the President and the attempted\r\nassassination of the Secretary of State, and shall be subject to trial\r\nbefore a military commission, and the punishment of death.\r\n\r\nLet the stain of innocent blood be removed from the land by the arrest\r\nand punishment of the murderers.\r\n\r\nAll good citizens are exhorted to aid public justice on this occasion.\r\nEvery man should consider his own conscience charged with this solemn\r\nduty, and rest neither night nor day until it be accomplished.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH FOUND IN A BARN.\r\n\r\nBooth, accompanied by David C. Herold, a fellow-conspirator, finally\r\nmade his way into Maryland, where eleven days after the assassination\r\nthe two were discovered in a barn on Garrett’s farm near Port Royal on\r\nthe Rappahannock. The barn was surrounded by a squad of cavalrymen, who\r\ncalled upon the assassins to surrender. Herold gave himself up and was\r\nroundly cursed and abused by Booth, who declared that he would never be\r\ntaken alive.\r\n\r\nThe cavalrymen then set fire to the barn and as the flames leaped up the\r\nfigure of the assassin could be plainly seen, although the wall of fire\r\nprevented him from seeing the soldiers. Colonel Conger saw him standing\r\nupright upon a crutch with a carbine in his hands.\r\n\r\nWhen the fire first blazed up Booth crept on his hands and knees to the\r\nspot, evidently for the purpose of shooting the man who had applied the\r\ntorch, but the blaze prevented him from seeing anyone. Then it seemed\r\nas if he were preparing to extinguish the flames, but seeing the\r\nimpossibility of this he started toward the door with his carbine held\r\nready for action.\r\n\r\nHis eyes shone with the light of fever, but he was pale as death and\r\nhis general appearance was haggard and unkempt. He had shaved off his\r\nmustache and his hair was closely cropped. Both he and Herold wore the\r\nuniforms of Confederate soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH SHOT BY “BOSTON” CORBETT.\r\n\r\nThe last orders given to the squad pursuing Booth were: “Don’t shoot\r\nBooth, but take him alive.” Just as Booth started to the door of the\r\nbarn this order was disobeyed by a sergeant named Boston Corbett, who\r\nfired through a crevice and shot Booth in the neck. The wounded man was\r\ncarried out of the barn and died four hours afterward on the grass where\r\nthey had laid him. Before he died he whispered to Lieutenant Baker,\r\n“Tell mother I died for my country; I thought I did for the best.” What\r\nbecame of Booth’s body has always been and probably always will be a\r\nmystery. Many different stories have been told concerning his final\r\nresting place, but all that is known positively is that the body was\r\nfirst taken to Washington and a post-mortem examination of it held on\r\nthe Monitor Montauk. On the night of April 27th it was turned over to\r\ntwo men who took it in a rowboat and disposed of it secretly. How they\r\ndisposed of it none but themselves know and they have never told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFATE OF THE CONSPIRATORS.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy to assassinate the President involved altogether\r\ntwenty-five people. Among the number captured and tried were David\r\nC. Herold, G. W. Atzerodt, Louis Payne, Edward Spangler, Michael\r\nO’Loughlin, Samuel Arnold, Mrs. Surratt and Dr. Samuel Mudd, a\r\nphysician, who set Booth’s leg, which was sprained by his fall from\r\nthe stage box. Of these Herold, Atzerodt, Payne and Mrs. Surratt were\r\nhanged. Dr. Mudd was deported to the Dry Tortugas. While there an\r\nepidemic of yellow fever broke out and he rendered such good service\r\nthat he was granted a pardon and died a number of years ago in Maryland.\r\n\r\nJohn Surratt, the son of the woman who was hanged, made his escape to\r\nItaly, where he became one of the Papal guards in the Vatican at Rome.\r\nHis presence there was discovered by Archbishop Hughes, and, although\r\nthere were no extradition laws to cover his case, the Italian Government\r\ngave him up to the United States authorities.\r\n\r\nHe had two trials. At the first the jury disagreed; the long delay\r\nbefore his second trial allowed him to escape by pleading the statute\r\nof limitation. Spangler and O’Loughlin were sent to the Dry Tortugas and\r\nserved their time.\r\n\r\nFord, the owner of the theatre in which the President was assassinated,\r\nwas a Southern sympathizer, and when he attempted to re-open his theatre\r\nafter the great national tragedy, Secretary Stanton refused to allow\r\nit. The Government afterward bought the theatre and turned it into a\r\nNational museum.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was buried at Springfield, and on the day of his\r\nfuneral there was universal grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY WARD BEECHER’S EULOGY.\r\n\r\nNo final words of that great life can be more fitly spoken than the\r\neulogy pronounced by Henry Ward Beecher:\r\n\r\n“And now the martyr is moving in triumphal march, mightier than when\r\nalive. The nation rises up at every stage of his coming. Cities and\r\nStates are his pall-bearers, and the cannon speaks the hours with solemn\r\nprogression. Dead, dead, dead, he yet speaketh.\r\n\r\n“Is Washington dead? Is Hampden dead? Is any man that was ever fit to\r\nlive dead? Disenthralled of flesh, risen to the unobstructed sphere\r\nwhere passion never comes, he begins his illimitable work. His life is\r\nnow grafted upon the infinite, and will be fruitful as no earthly life\r\ncan be.\r\n\r\n“Pass on, thou that hast overcome. Ye people, behold the martyr whose\r\nblood, as so many articulate words, pleads for fidelity, for law, for\r\nliberty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN’S FAMILY.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln was married on November 4, 1842, to Miss Mary Todd, four\r\nsons being the issue of the union.\r\n\r\nRobert Todd, born August 1, 1843, removed to Chicago after his father’s\r\ndeath, practiced law, and became wealthy; in 1881 he was appointed\r\nSecretary of War by President Garfield, and served through President\r\nArthur’s term; was made Minister to England in 1889, and served four\r\nyears; became counsel for the Pullman Palace Car Company, and succeeded\r\nto the presidency of that corporation upon the death of George M.\r\nPullman.\r\n\r\nEdward Baker, born March 10, 1846, died in infancy.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wallace, born December 21, 1850, died in the White House in\r\nFebruary, 1862.\r\n\r\nThomas (known as “Tad”), born April 4, 1853, died in 1871.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln died in her sixty-fourth year at the home of her sister,\r\nMrs. Ninian W. Edwards, at Springfield, Illinois, in 1882. She was the\r\ndaughter of Robert S. Todd, of Kentucky. Her great-uncle, John Todd, and\r\nher grandfather, Levi Todd, accompanied General George Rogers Clark to\r\nIllinois, and were present at the capture of Kaskaskia and Vincennes.\r\nIn December, 1778, John Todd was appointed by Patrick Henry, Governor\r\nof Virginia, to be lieutenant of the County of Illinois, then a part of\r\nVirginia. Colonel John Todd was one of the original proprietors of the\r\ntown of Lexington, Kentucky. While encamped on the site of the present\r\ncity, he heard of the opening battle of the Revolution, and named his\r\ninfant settlement in its honor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln was a proud, ambitious woman, well-educated, speaking\r\nFrench fluently, and familiar with the ways of the best society in\r\nLexington, Kentucky, where she was born December 13, 1818. She was a\r\npupil of Madame Mantelli, whose celebrated seminary in Lexington was\r\ndirectly opposite the residence of Henry Clay. The conversation at the\r\nseminary was carried on entirely in French.\r\n\r\nShe visited Springfield, Illinois, in 1837, remained three months and\r\nthen returned to her native State. In 1839 she made Springfield her\r\npermanent home. She lived with her eldest sister, Elizabeth, wife of\r\nNinian W. Edwards, Lincoln’s colleague in the Legislature, and it was\r\nnot strange she and Lincoln should meet. Stephen A. Douglas was also\r\na friend of the Edwards family, and a suitor for her hand, but she\r\nrejected him to accept the future President. She was one of the belles\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nShe is thus described at the time she made her home in\r\nSpringfield--1839:\r\n\r\n“She was of the average height, weighing about a hundred and thirty\r\npounds. She was rather compactly built, had a well rounded face, rich\r\ndark-brown hair, and bluish-gray eyes. In her bearing she was proud,\r\nbut handsome and vivacious; she was a good conversationalist, using with\r\nequal fluency the French and English languages.\r\n\r\n“When she used a pen, its point was sure to be sharp, and she wrote with\r\nwit and ability. She not only had a quick intellect but an intuitive\r\njudgment of men and their motives. Ordinarily she was affable and even\r\ncharming in her manners; but when offended or antagonized she could be\r\nvery bitter and sarcastic.\r\n\r\n“In her figure and physical proportions, in education, bearing,\r\ntemperament, history--in everything she was the exact reverse of\r\nLincoln.”\r\n\r\nThat Mrs. Lincoln was very proud of her husband there is no doubt; and\r\nit is probable that she married him largely from motives of ambition.\r\nShe knew Lincoln better than he knew himself; she instinctively felt\r\nthat he would occupy a proud position some day, and it is a matter of\r\nrecord that she told Ward Lamon, her husband’s law partner, that “Mr.\r\nLincoln will yet be President of the United States.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln was decidedly pro-slavery in her views, but this never\r\ndisturbed Lincoln. In various ways they were unlike. Her fearless,\r\nwitty, and austere nature had nothing in common with the calm,\r\nimperturbable, and simple ways of her thoughtful and absent-minded\r\nhusband. She was bright and sparkling in conversation, and fit to grace\r\nany drawing-room. She well knew that to marry Lincoln meant not a life\r\nof luxury and ease, for Lincoln was not a man to accumulate wealth; but\r\nin him she saw position in society, prominence in the world, and the\r\ngrandest social distinction. By that means her ambition was certainly\r\nsatisfied, for nineteen years after her marriage she was “the first lady\r\nof the land,” and the mistress of the White House.\r\n\r\nAfter his marriage, by dint of untiring efforts and the recognition of\r\ninfluential friends, the couple managed through rare frugality to move\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nIn Lincoln’s struggles, both in the law and for political advancement,\r\nhis wife shared his sacrifices. She was a plucky little woman, and in\r\nfact endowed with a more restless ambition than he. She was gifted with\r\na rare insight into the motives that actuate mankind, and there is no\r\ndoubt that much of Lincoln’s success was in a measure attributable to\r\nher acuteness and the stimulus of her influence.\r\n\r\nHis election to Congress within four years after their marriage afforded\r\nher extreme gratification. She loved power and prominence, and was\r\ninordinately proud of her tall and ungainly husband. She saw in him\r\nbright prospects ahead, and his every move was watched by her with the\r\nclosest interest. If to other persons he seemed homely, to her he was\r\nthe embodiment of noble manhood, and each succeeding day impressed upon\r\nher the wisdom of her choice of Lincoln over Douglas--if in reality she\r\never seriously accepted the latter’s attentions.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lincoln may not be as handsome a figure,” she said one day in\r\nLincoln’s law office during her husband’s absence, when the conversation\r\nturned on Douglas, “but the people are perhaps not aware that his heart\r\nis as large as his arms are long.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN MONUMENT AT SPRINGFIELD.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Abraham Lincoln rest beneath a magnificent monument in\r\nOak Ridge Cemetery, Springfield, Ill. Before they were deposited in\r\ntheir final resting place they were moved many times.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 1865, all that was mortal of Abraham Lincoln was deposited\r\nin the receiving vault at the cemetery, until a tomb could be built. In\r\n1876 thieves made an unsuccessful attempt to steal the remains. From\r\nthe tomb the body of the martyred President was removed later to the\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nA flight of iron steps, commencing about fifty yards east of the vault,\r\nascends in a curved line to the monument, an elevation of more than\r\nfifty feet.\r\n\r\nExcavation for this monument commenced September 9, 1869. It is built\r\nof granite, from quarries at Biddeford, Maine. The rough ashlers were\r\nshipped to Quincy, Massachusetts, where they were dressed and numbered,\r\nthence shipped to Springfield. It is 721 feet from east to west, 119\r\n1/2 feet from north to south, and 100 feet high. The total cost is about\r\n$230,000 to May 1, 1885. All the statuary is orange-colored bronze. The\r\nwhole monument was designed by Larkin G. Mead; the statuary was modeled\r\nin plaster by him in Florence, Italy, and cast by the Ames Manufacturing\r\nCompany, of Chicopee, Massachusetts. A statue of Lincoln and Coat of\r\nArms were first placed on the monument; the statue was unveiled and the\r\nmonument dedicated October 15, 1874. Infantry and Naval Groups were put\r\non in September, 1877, an Artillery Group, April 13, 1882, and a Cavalry\r\nGroup, March 13, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe principal front of the monument is on the south side, the statue of\r\nLincoln being on that side of the obelisk, over Memorial Hall. On the\r\neast side are three tablets, upon which are the letters U. S. A. To the\r\nright of that, and beginning with Virginia, we find the abbreviations of\r\nthe original thirteen States. Next comes Vermont, the first state\r\nadmitted after the Union was perfected, the States following in the\r\norder they were admitted, ending with Nebraska on the east, thus forming\r\nthe cordon of thirty-seven States composing the United States of America\r\nwhen the monument was erected. The new States admitted since the\r\nmonument was built have been added.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Lincoln is just above the Coat of Arms of the United\r\nStates. The grand climax is indicated by President Lincoln, with his\r\nleft hand holding out as a golden scepter the emancipation Proclamation,\r\nwhile in his right he holds the pen with which he has just written it.\r\nThe right hand is resting on another badge of authority, the American\r\nflag, thrown over the fasces. At the foot of the fasces lies a wreath of\r\nlaurel, with which to crown the President as the victor over slavery and\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 1900, President Lincoln’s body was removed to a temporary\r\nvault to permit of alterations to the monument. The shaft was made\r\ntwenty feet higher, and other changes were made costing $100,000.\r\n\r\nApril 24, 1901. the body was again transferred to the monument without\r\npublic ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lincoln’s Yarns and Stories, by\r\nAlexander K.
