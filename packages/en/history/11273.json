A majority of the facts and testimony\r\ncontained in this work rests upon the authority of slaveholders, whose\r\nnames and residences are given to the public, as vouchers for the\r\ntruth of their statements. That they should utter falsehoods, for the\r\nsake of proclaiming their own infamy, is not probable.\r\n\r\nTheir testimony is taken, mainly, from recent newspapers, published in\r\nthe slave states. Most of those papers will be deposited at the office\r\nof the American Anti-Slavery Society, 143 Nassau street, New York\r\nCity. Those who think the atrocities, which they describe, incredible,\r\nare invited to call and read for themselves. We regret that _all_ of\r\nthe original papers are not in our possession. The idea of preserving\r\nthem on file for the inspection of the incredulous, and the curious,\r\ndid not occur to us until after the preparation of the work was in a\r\nstate of forwardness, in consequence of this, some of the papers\r\ncannot be recovered. _Nearly all_ of them, however have been\r\npreserved. In all cases the _name_ of the paper is given, and, with\r\nvery few exceptions, the place and time, (year, month, and day) of\r\npublication. Some of the extracts, however not being made with\r\nreference to this work, and before its publication was contemplated,\r\nare without date; but this class of extracts is exceedingly small,\r\nprobably not a thirtieth of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe statements, not derived from the papers and other periodicals,\r\nletters, books, &c., published by slaveholders, have been furnished by\r\nindividuals who have resided in slave states, many of whom are natives\r\nof those states, and have been slaveholders. The names, residences,\r\n&c. of the witnesses generally are given. A number of them, however,\r\nstill reside in slave states;--to publish their names would be, in most\r\ncases, to make them the victims of popular fury.\r\n\r\nNew York, May 4, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society, while\r\ntendering their grateful acknowledgments, in the name of American\r\nAbolitionists, and in behalf of the slave, to those who have furnished\r\nfor this publication the result of their residence and travel in the\r\nslave states of this Union, announce their determination to publish,\r\nfrom time to time, as they may have the materials and the funds,\r\nTRACTS, containing well authenticated facts, testimony, personal\r\nnarratives, &c. fully setting forth the _condition_ of American\r\nslaves. In order that they may be furnished with the requisite\r\nmaterials, they invite all who have had personal knowledge of the\r\ncondition of slaves in any of the states of this Union, to forward\r\ntheir testimony with their names and residences. To prevent\r\nimposition, it is indispensable that persons forwarding testimony, who\r\nare not personally known to any of the Executive Committee, or to the\r\nSecretaries or Editors of the American Anti-Slavery Society, should\r\nfurnish references to some person or persons of respectability, with\r\nwhom, if necessary, the Committee may communicate respecting the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nFacts and testimony respecting the condition of slaves, in _all\r\nrespects_, are desired; their food, (kinds, quality, and quantity,)\r\nclothing, lodging, dwellings, hours of labor and rest, kinds of labor,\r\nwith the mode of exaction, supervision, &c.--the number and time of\r\nmeals each day, treatment when sick, regulations inspecting their\r\nsocial intercourse, marriage and domestic ties, the system of torture\r\nto which they are subjected, with its various modes; and _in detail_,\r\ntheir _intellectual_ and _moral_ condition. Great care should be\r\nobserved in the statement of facts. Well-weighed testimony and\r\nwell-authenticated facts; with a responsible name, the Committee\r\nearnestly desire and call for. Thousands of persons in the free states\r\nhave ample knowledge on this subject, derived from their own\r\nobservation in the midst of slavery. Will such hold their peace? That\r\nwhich maketh manifest is _light_; he who keepeth his candle under a\r\nbushel at such a time and in such a cause as this, _forges fetters for\r\nhimself_, as well as for the slave. Let no one withhold his testimony\r\nbecause others have already testified to similar facts. The value of\r\ntestimony is by no means to be measured by the _novelty_ of the\r\nhorrors which it describes. _Corroborative_ testimony,--facts, similar\r\nto those established by the testimony of others,--is highly valuable.\r\nWho that can give it and has a heart of flesh, will refuse to the\r\nslave so small a boon?\r\n\r\nCommunications may be addressed to Theodore D. Weld, 143\r\nNassau-street, New York.

The question at issue is not one of law, but of\r\nfacts--\"What is the actual condition of the slaves in the United\r\nStates?\" A plainer case never went to a jury. Look at it. TWENTY-SEVEN\r\nHUNDRED THOUSAND PERSONS in this country, men, women, and children,\r\nare in SLAVERY. Is slavery, as a condition for human beings, good,\r\nbad, or indifferent? We submit the question without argument. You have\r\ncommon sense, and conscience, and a human heart;--pronounce upon it.\r\nYou have a wife, or a husband, a child, a father, a mother, a brother\r\nor a sister--make the case your own, make it theirs, and bring in your\r\nverdict. The case of Human Rights against Slavery has been adjudicated\r\nin the court of conscience times innumerable. The same verdict has\r\nalways been rendered--\"Guilty;\" the same sentence has always been\r\npronounced, \"Let it be accursed;\" and human nature, with her million\r\nechoes, has rung it round the world in every language under heaven,\r\n\"Let it be accursed. Let it be accursed.\" His heart is false to human\r\nnature, who will not say \"Amen.\" There is not a man on earth who does\r\nnot believe that slavery is a curse. Human beings may be inconsistent,\r\nbut human _nature_ is true to herself. She has uttered her testimony\r\nagainst slavery with a shriek ever since the monster was begotten; and\r\ntill it perishes amidst the execrations of the universe, she will\r\ntraverse the world on its track, dealing her bolts upon its head, and\r\ndashing against it her condemning brand. We repeat it, every man knows\r\nthat slavery is a curse. Whoever denies this, his lips libel his\r\nheart. Try him; clank the chains in his ears, and tell him they are\r\nfor _him_; give him an hour to prepare his wife and children for a\r\nlife of slavery; bid him make haste and get ready their necks for the\r\nyoke, and their wrists for the coffle chains, then look at his pale\r\nlips and trembling knees, and you have _nature's_ testimony against\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nTwo millions seven hundred thousand persons in these States are in\r\nthis condition. They were made slaves and are held each by force, and\r\nby being put in fear, and this for no crime! Reader, what have you to\r\nsay of such treatment? Is it right, just, benevolent? Suppose I should\r\nseize you, rob you of your liberty, drive you into the field, and make\r\nyou work without pay as long as you live, would that be justice and\r\nkindness, or monstrous injustice and cruelty? Now, every body knows\r\nthat the slaveholders do these things to the slaves every day, and yet\r\nit is stoutly affirmed that they treat them well and kindly, and that\r\ntheir tender regard for their slaves restrains the masters from\r\ninflicting cruelties upon them. We shall go into no metaphysics to\r\nshow the absurdity of this pretence. The man who _robs_ you every day,\r\nis, forsooth, quite too tender-hearted ever to cuff or kick you! True,\r\nhe can snatch your money, but he does it gently lest he should hurt\r\nyou. He can empty your pockets without qualms, but if your _stomach_\r\nis empty, it cuts him to the quick. He can make you work a life time\r\nwithout pay, but loves you too well to let you go hungry. He fleeces\r\nyou of your _rights_ with a relish, but is shocked if you work\r\nbareheaded in summer, or in winter without warm stockings. He can make\r\nyou go without your _liberty_, but never without a shirt. He can\r\ncrush, in you, all hope of bettering your condition, by vowing that\r\nyou shall die his slave, but though he can coolly torture your\r\nfeelings, he is too compassionate to lacerate your back--he can break\r\nyour heart, but he is very tender of your skin. He can strip you of\r\nall protection and thus expose you to all outrages, but if you are\r\nexposed to the _weather_, half clad and half sheltered, how yearn his\r\ntender bowels! What! slaveholders talk of treating men well, and yet\r\nnot only rob them of all they get, and as fast as they get it, but rob\r\nthem of _themselves_, also; their very hands and feet, all their\r\nmuscles, and limbs, and senses, their bodies and minds, their time and\r\nliberty and earnings, their free speech and rights of conscience,\r\ntheir right to acquire knowledge, and property, and reputation;--and\r\nyet they, who plunder them of all these, would fain make us believe\r\nthat their soft hearts ooze out so lovingly toward their slaves that\r\nthey always keep them well housed and well clad, never push them too\r\nhard in the field, never make their dear backs smart, nor let their\r\ndear stomachs get empty.\r\n\r\nBut there is no end to these absurdities. Are slaveholders dunces, or\r\ndo they take all the rest of the world to be, that they think to\r\nbandage our eyes with such thin gauzes? Protesting their kind regard\r\nfor those whom they hourly plunder of all they have and all they get!\r\nWhat! when they have seized their victims, and annihilated all their\r\n_rights_, still claim to be the special guardians of their\r\n_happiness_! Plunderers of their liberty, yet the careful suppliers of\r\ntheir wants? Robbers of their earnings, yet watchful sentinels round\r\ntheir interests, and kind providers for their comfort? Filching all\r\ntheir time, yet granting generous donations for rest and sleep?\r\nStealing the use of their muscles, yet thoughtful of their ease?\r\nPutting them under _drivers_, yet careful that they are not\r\nhard-pushed? Too humane forsooth to stint the stomachs of their\r\nslaves, yet force their _minds_ to starve, and brandish over them\r\npains and penalties, if they dare to reach forth for the smallest\r\ncrumb of knowledge, even a letter of the alphabet!\r\n\r\nIt is no marvel that slaveholders are always talking of their _kind\r\ntreatment_ of their slaves. The only marvel is, that men of sense can\r\nbe gulled by such professions. Despots always insist that they are\r\nmerciful. The greatest tyrants that ever dripped with blood have\r\nassumed the titles of \"most gracious,\" \"most clement,\" \"most\r\nmerciful,\" &c., and have ordered their crouching vassals to accost\r\nthem thus. When did not vice lay claim to those virtues which are the\r\nopposites of its habitual crimes? The guilty, according to their own\r\nshowing, are always innocent, and cowards brave, and drunkards sober,\r\nand harlots chaste, and pickpockets honest to a fault. Every body\r\nunderstands this. When a man's tongue grows thick, and he begins to\r\nhiccough and walk cross-legged, we expect him, as a matter of course,\r\nto protest that he is not drunk; so when a man is always singing the\r\npraises of his own honesty, we instinctively watch his movements and\r\nlook out for our pocket-books. Whoever is simple enough to be hoaxed\r\nby such professions, should never be trusted in the streets without\r\nsomebody to take care of him. Human nature works out in slaveholders\r\njust as it does to other men, and in American slaveholders just as in\r\nEnglish, French, Turkish, Algerine, Roman and Grecian. The Spartans\r\nboasted of their kindness to their slaves, while they whipped them to\r\ndeath by thousands at the altars of their gods. The Romans lauded\r\ntheir own mild treatment of their bondmen, while they branded their\r\nnames on their flesh with hot irons, and when old, threw them into\r\ntheir fish ponds, or like Cato \"the Just,\" starved them to death. It\r\nis the boast of the Turks that they treat their slaves as though they\r\nwere their children, yet their common name for them is \"dogs,\" and for\r\nthe merest trifles, their feet are bastinadoed to a jelly, or their\r\nheads clipped off with the scimetar. The Portuguese pride themselves\r\non their gentle bearing toward their slaves, yet the streets of Rio\r\nJaneiro are filled with naked men and women yoked in pairs to carts\r\nand wagons, and whipped by drivers like beasts of burden.\r\n\r\nSlaveholders, the world over, have sung the praises of their tender\r\nmercies towards their slaves. Even the wretches that plied the African\r\nslave trade, tried to rebut Clarkson's proofs of their cruelties, by\r\nspeeches, affidavits, and published pamphlets, setting forth the\r\naccommodations of the \"middle passage,\" and their kind attentions to\r\nthe comfort of those whom they had stolen from their homes, and kept\r\nstowed away under hatches, during a voyage of four thousand miles. So,\r\naccording to the testimony of the autocrat of the Russias, he\r\nexercises great clemency towards the Poles, though he exiles them by\r\nthousands to the snows of Siberia, and tramples them down by millions,\r\nat home. Who discredits the atrocities perpetrated by Ovando in\r\nHispaniola, Pizarro in Peru, and Cortez in Mexico,--because they\r\nfilled the ears of the Spanish Court with protestations of their\r\nbenignant rule? While they were yoking the enslaved natives like\r\nbeasts to the draught, working them to death by thousands in their\r\nmines, hunting them with bloodhounds, torturing them on racks, and\r\nbroiling them on beds of coals, their representations to the mother\r\ncountry teemed with eulogies of their parental sway! The bloody\r\natrocities of Philip II, in the expulsion of his Moorish subjects, are\r\nmatters of imperishable history. Who disbelieves or doubts them? And\r\nyet his courtiers magnified his virtues and chanted his clemency and\r\nhis mercy, while the wail of a million victims, smitten down by a\r\ntempest of fire and slaughter let loose at his bidding, rose above the\r\n_Te Deums_ that thundered from all Spain's cathedrals. When Louis XIV.\r\nrevoked the edict of Nantz, and proclaimed two millions of his\r\nsubjects free plunder for persecution,--when from the English channel\r\nto the Pyrennees the mangled bodies of the Protestants were dragged on\r\nreeking hurdles by a shouting populace, he claimed to be \"the father\r\nof his people,\" and wrote himself \"His most _Christian_ Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nBut we will not anticipate topics, the full discussion of which more\r\nnaturally follows than precedes the inquiry into the actual condition\r\nand treatment of slaves in the United States.\r\n\r\nAs slaveholders and their apologists are volunteer witnesses in their\r\nown cause, and are flooding the world with testimony that their slaves\r\nare kindly treated; that they are well fed, well clothed, well housed,\r\nwell lodged, moderately worked, and bountifully provided with all\r\nthings needful for their comfort, we propose--first, to disprove their\r\nassertions by the testimony of a multitude of impartial witnesses, and\r\nthen to put slaveholders themselves through a course of\r\ncross-questioning which shall draw their condemnation out of their own\r\nmouths. We will prove that the slaves in the United States are treated\r\nwith barbarous inhumanity; that they are overworked, underfed,\r\nwretchedly clad and lodged, and have insufficient sleep; that they are\r\noften made to wear round their necks iron collars armed with prongs,\r\nto drag heavy chains and weights at their feet while working in the\r\nfield, and to wear yokes, and bells, and iron horns; that they are\r\noften kept confined in the stocks day and night for weeks together,\r\nmade to wear gags in their mouths for hours or days, have some of\r\ntheir front teeth torn out or broken off, that they may be easily\r\ndetected when they run away; that they are frequently flogged with\r\nterrible severity, have red pepper rubbed into their lacerated flesh,\r\nand hot brine, spirits of turpentine, &c., poured over the gashes to\r\nincrease the torture; that they are often stripped naked, their backs\r\nand limbs cut with knives, bruised and mangled by scores and hundreds\r\nof blows with the paddle, and terribly torn by the claws of cats,\r\ndrawn over them by their tormentors; that they are often hunted with\r\nbloodhounds and shot down like beasts, or torn in pieces by dogs; that\r\nthey are often suspended by the arms and whipped and beaten till they\r\nfaint, and when revived by restoratives, beaten again till they faint,\r\nand sometimes till they die; that their ears are often cut off, their\r\neyes knocked out, their bones broken, their flesh branded with red hot\r\nirons; that they are maimed, mutilated and burned to death over slow\r\nfires. All these things, and more, and worse, we shall _prove_.\r\nReader, we know whereof we affirm, we have weighed it well; _more and\r\nworse_ WE WILL PROVE. Mark these words, and read on; we will establish\r\nall these facts by the testimony of scores and hundreds of eye\r\nwitnesses, by the testimony of _slaveholders_ in all parts of the\r\nslave states, by slaveholding members of Congress and of state\r\nlegislatures, by ambassadors to foreign courts, by judges, by doctors\r\nof divinity, and clergymen of all denominations, by merchants,\r\nmechanics, lawyers and physicians, by presidents and professors in\r\ncolleges and _professional_ seminaries, by planters, overseers and\r\ndrivers. We shall show, not merely that such deeds are committed, but\r\nthat they are frequent; not done in corners, but before the sun; not\r\nin one of the slave states, but in all of them; not perpetrated by\r\nbrutal overseers and drivers merely, but by magistrates, by\r\nlegislators, by professors of religion, by preachers of the gospel, by\r\ngovernors of states, by \"gentlemen of property and standing,\" and by\r\ndelicate females moving in the \"highest circles of society.\" We know,\r\nfull well, the outcry that will be made by multitudes, at these\r\ndeclarations; the multiform cavils, the flat denials, the charges of\r\n\"exaggeration\" and \"falsehood\" so often bandied, the sneers of\r\naffected contempt at the credulity that can believe such things, and\r\nthe rage and imprecations against those who give them currency. We\r\nknow, too, the threadbare sophistries by which slaveholders and their\r\napologists seek to evade such testimony. If they admit that such deeds\r\nare committed, they tell us that they are exceedingly rare, and\r\ntherefore furnish no grounds for judging of the general treatment of\r\nslaves; that occasionally a brutal wretch in the _free_ states\r\nbarbarously butchers his wife, but that no one thinks of inferring\r\nfrom that, the general treatment of wives at the North and West.\r\n\r\nThey tell us, also, that the slaveholders of the South are\r\nproverbially hospitable, kind, and generous, and it is incredible that\r\nthey can perpetrate such enormities upon human beings; further, that\r\nit is absurd to suppose that they would thus injure their own\r\nproperty, that self-interest would prompt them to treat their slaves\r\nwith kindness, as none but fools and madmen wantonly destroy their own\r\nproperty; further, that Northern visitors at the South come back\r\ntestifying to the kind treatment of the slaves, and that the slaves\r\nthemselves corroborate such representations. All these pleas, and\r\nscores of others, are bruited in every corner of the free States; and\r\nwho that hath eyes to see, has not sickened at the blindness that saw\r\nnot, at the palsy of heart that felt not, or at the cowardice and\r\nsycophancy that dared not expose such shallow fallacies. We are not to\r\nbe turned from our purpose by such vapid babblings. In their\r\nappropriate places, we propose to consider these objections and\r\nvarious others, and to show their emptiness and folly.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing declarations touching the inflictions upon slaves, are\r\nnot hap-hazard assertions, nor the exaggerations of fiction conjured\r\nup to carry a point; nor are they the rhapsodies of enthusiasm, nor\r\ncrude conclusions, jumped at by hasty and imperfect investigation, nor\r\nthe aimless outpourings either of sympathy or poetry; but they are\r\nproclamations of deliberate, well-weighed convictions, produced by\r\naccumulations of proof, by affirmations and affidavits, by written\r\ntestimonies and statements of a cloud of witnesses who speak what they\r\nknow and testify what they have seen, and all these impregnably\r\nfortified by proofs innumerable, in the relation of the slaveholder to\r\nhis slave, the nature of arbitrary power, and the nature and history\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nOf the witnesses whose testimony is embodied in the following pages, a\r\nmajority are slaveholders, many of the remainder have been\r\nslaveholders, but now reside in free States.\r\n\r\nAnother class whose testimony will be given, consists of those who\r\nhave furnished the results of their own observation during periods of\r\nresidence and travel in the slave States.\r\n\r\nWe will first present the reader with a few PERSONAL NARRATIVES\r\nfurnished by individuals, natives of slave states and others,\r\nembodying, in the main, the results of their own observation in the\r\nmidst of slavery--facts and scenes of which they were eye-witnesses.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, to give the reader as clear and definite a view of\r\nthe actual condition of slaves as possible, we propose to make\r\nspecific points; to pass in review the various particulars in the\r\nslave's condition, simply presenting sufficient testimony under each\r\nhead to settle the question in every candid mind. The examination will\r\nbe conducted by stating distinct propositions, and in the following\r\norder of topics.\r\n\r\n1. THE FOOD OF THE SLAVES, THE KINDS, QUALITY AND QUANTITY, ALSO, THE\r\nNUMBER AND TIME OF MEALS EACH DAY, &c.\r\n\r\n2. THEIR HOURS OF LABOR AND REST.\r\n\r\n3. THEIR CLOTHING.\r\n\r\n4. THEIR DWELLINGS.\r\n\r\n5. THEIR PRIVATIONS AND INFLICTIONS.\r\n\r\n6. _In conclusion,_ a variety of OBJECTIONS and ARGUMENTS will be\r\nconsidered which are used by the advocates of slavery to set\r\naside the force of testimony, and to show that the slaves are kindly\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nBetween the larger divisions of the work, brief personal narratives\r\nwill be inserted, containing a mass of facts and testimony, both\r\ngeneral and specific.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL NARRATIVES.\r\n\r\nMR. NEHEMIAH CAULKINS, of Waterford, New London Co., Connecticut, has\r\nfurnished the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, with the following statements relative to the condition and\r\ntreatment of slaves, in the south eastern part of North Carolina. Most\r\nof the facts related by Mr. Caulkins fell under his personal\r\nobservation. The air of candor and honesty that pervades the\r\nnarrative, the manner in which Mr. C. has drawn it up, the good sense,\r\njust views, conscience and heart which it exhibits, are sufficient of\r\nthemselves to commend it to all who have ears to hear.\r\n\r\nThe Committee have no personal acquaintance with Mr. Caulkins, but\r\nthey have ample testimonials from the most respectable sources, all of\r\nwhich represent him to be a man whose long established character for\r\nsterling integrity, sound moral principle and piety, have secured for\r\nhim the uniform respect and confidence of those who know him.\r\n\r\nWithout further preface the following testimonials are submitted to\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may certify, that we the subscribers have lived for a number of\r\nyears past in the neighborhood with Mr. Nehemiah Caulkins, and have no\r\nhesitation in stating that we consider him a man of high\r\nrespectability and that his character for truth and veracity is\r\nunimpeachable.

His opportunities to acquire exact knowledge in\r\nrelation to Slavery, in that section of our country, to which his\r\nnarrative is confined, have been very great. He is a carpenter, and\r\nwas employed principally on the plantations, working at his trade,\r\nbeing thus almost constantly in the company of the slaves as well as\r\nof their masters. His full heart readily responded to the call, [for\r\ninformation relative to slavery,] for, as he expressed it, he had long\r\ndesired that others might know what he had seen, being confident that\r\na general knowledge of facts as they exist, would greatly promote the\r\noverthrow of the system. He is a man of undoubted character; and where\r\nknown, his statements need no corroboration.\r\n\r\nYours, &c. WILLIAM BOLLES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF MR. CAULKINS.\r\n\r\nI feel it my duty to tell some things that I know about slavery, in\r\norder, if possible, to awaken more feeling at the North in behalf of\r\nthe slave. The treatment of the slaves on the plantations where I had\r\nthe greatest opportunity of getting knowledge, _was not so bad_ as\r\nthat on some neighboring estates, where the owners were noted for\r\ntheir cruelty. There were, however, other estates in the vicinity,\r\nwhere the treatment was better; the slaves were better clothed and\r\nfed, were not worked so hard, and more attention was paid to their\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe scenes that I have witnessed are enough to harrow up the soul; but\r\ncould the slave be permitted to tell the story of his sufferings,\r\nwhich no white man, not linked with slavery, _is allowed to know,_ the\r\nland would vomit out the horrible system, slaveholders and all, if\r\nthey would not unclinch their grasp upon their defenceless victims.\r\n\r\nI spent eleven winters, between the years 1824 and 1835, in the state\r\nof North Carolina, mostly in the vicinity of Wilmington; and four out\r\nof the eleven on the estate of Mr. John Swan, five or six miles from\r\nthat place. There were on his plantation about seventy slaves, male\r\nand female: some were married, and others lived together as man and\r\nwife, without even a mock ceremony. With their owners generally, it is\r\na matter of indifference; the marriage of slaves not being recognized\r\nby the slave code. The slaves, however, think much of being married by\r\na clergyman.\r\n\r\nThe cabins or huts of the slaves were small, and were built\r\nprincipally by the slaves themselves, as they could find time on\r\nSundays and moonlight nights; they went into the swamps, cut the logs,\r\nbacked or hauled them to the quarters, and put up their cabins.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew Mr. Swan's plantation, his overseer was a man who\r\nhad been a Methodist minister. He treated the slaves with great\r\ncruelty. His reason for leaving the ministry and becoming an overseer,\r\nas I was informed, was this: his wife died, at which providence he was\r\nso enraged, that he swore he would not preach for the Lord another\r\nday. This man continued on the plantation about three years; at the\r\nclose of which, on settlement of accounts, Mr. Swan owed him about\r\n$400, for which he turned him out a negro woman, and about twenty\r\nacres of land. He built a log hut, and took the woman to live with\r\nhim; since which, I have been at his hut, and seen four or five\r\nmulatto children. He has been appointed _justice of the peace_, and\r\nhis place as overseer was afterwards occupied by a Mr. Galloway.\r\n\r\nIt is customary in that part of the country, to let the hogs run in\r\nthe woods. On one occasion a slave caught a pig about two months old,\r\nwhich he carried to his quarters. The overseer, getting information of\r\nthe fact, went to the field where he was at work, and ordered him to\r\ncome to him. The slave at once suspected it was something about the\r\npig, and fearing punishment, dropped his hoe and ran for the woods. He\r\nhad got but a few rods, when the overseer raised his gun, loaded with\r\nduck shot, and brought him down. It is a common practice for overseers\r\nto go into the field armed with a gun or pistols, and sometimes both.\r\nHe was taken up by the slaves and carried to the plantation hospital,\r\nand the physician sent for. A physician was employed by the year to\r\ntake care of the sick or wounded slaves. In about six weeks this slave\r\ngot better, and was able to come out of the hospital. He came to the\r\nmill where I was at work, and asked me to examine his body, which I\r\ndid, and counted twenty-six duck shot still remaining in his flesh,\r\nthough the doctor had removed a number while he was laid up.\r\n\r\nThere was a slave on Mr. Swan's plantation, by the name of Harry, who,\r\nduring the absence of his master, ran away and secreted himself is the\r\nwoods. This the slaves sometimes do, when the master is absent for\r\nseveral weeks, to escape the cruel treatment of the overseer. It is\r\ncommon for them to make preparations, by secreting a mortar, a\r\nhatchet, some cooking utensils, and whatever things they can get that\r\nwill enable them to live while they are in the woods or swamps. Harry\r\nstaid about three months, and lived by robbing the rice grounds, and\r\nby such other means as came in his way. The slaves generally know\r\nwhere the runaway is secreted, and visit him at night and on Sundays.\r\nOn the return of his master, some of the slaves were sent for Harry.\r\nWhen he came home, he was seized and confined in the stocks. The\r\nstocks were built in the barn, and consisted of two heavy pieces of\r\ntimber, ten or more feet in length, and about seven inches wide; the\r\nlower one, on the floor, has a number of holes or places cut in it,\r\nfor the ancles; the upper piece, being of the same dimensions, is\r\nfastened at one end by a hinge, and is brought down after the ancles\r\nare placed in the holes, and secured by a clasp and padlock at the\r\nother end. In this manner the person is left to sit on the floor.\r\nBarry was kept in the stocks _day and night for a week_, and flogged\r\n_every morning_. After this, he was taken out one morning, a log chain\r\nfastened around his neck, the two ends dragging on the ground, and he\r\nsent to the field, to do his task with the other slaves. At night he\r\nwas again put in the stocks, in the morning he was sent to the field\r\nin the same manner, and thus dragged out another week.\r\n\r\nThe overseer was a very miserly fellow, and restricted his wife in\r\nwhat are considered the comforts of life--such as tea, sugar, &c. To\r\nmake up for this, she set her wits to work, and, by the help of a\r\nslave, named Joe, used to take from the plantation whatever she could\r\nconveniently, and watch her opportunity during her husband's absence,\r\nand send Joe to sell them and buy for her such things as she directed.\r\nOnce when her husband was away, she told Joe to kill and dress one of\r\nthe pigs, sell it, and get her some tea, sugar, &c. Joe did as he was\r\nbid, and she gave him the offal for his services. When Galloway\r\nreturned, not suspecting his wife, he asked her if she knew what had\r\nbecome of his pig. She told him she suspected one of the slaves,\r\nnaming him, had stolen it, for she had heard a pig squeal the evening\r\nbefore. The overseer called the slave up, and charged him with the\r\ntheft. He denied it, and said he knew nothing about it. The overseer\r\nstill charged him with it, and told him he would give him one week to\r\nthink of it, and if he did not confess the theft, or find out who did\r\nsteal the pig, he would flog every negro on the plantation; before the\r\nweek was up it was ascertained that Joe had killed the pig. He was\r\ncalled up and questioned, and admitted that he had done so, and told\r\nthe overseer that he did it by the order of Mrs. Galloway, and that\r\nshe directed him to buy some sugar, &c. with the money. Mrs. Galloway\r\ngave Joe the lie; and he was terribly flogged. Joe told me he had been\r\nseveral times to the smoke-house with Mrs. G, and taken hams and sold\r\nthem, which her husband told me he supposed were stolen by the negroes\r\non a neighboring plantation. Mr. Swan, hearing of the circumstance,\r\ntold me he believed Joe's story, but that his statement would not be\r\ntaken as proof; and if every slave on the plantation told the same\r\nstory it could not be received as evidence against a white person.\r\n\r\nTo show the manner in which old and worn-out slaves are sometimes\r\ntreated, I will state a fact. Galloway owned a man about seventy years\r\nof age. The old man was sick and went to his hut; laid himself down on\r\nsome straw with his feet to the fire, covered by a piece of an old\r\nblanket, and there lay four or five days, groaning in great distress,\r\nwithout any attention being paid him by his master, until death ended\r\nhis miseries; he was then taken out and buried with as little ceremony\r\nand respect as would be paid to a brute.\r\n\r\nThere is a practice prevalent among the planters, of letting a negro\r\noff from severe and long-continued punishment on account of the\r\nintercession of some white person, who pleads in his behalf, that he\r\nbelieves the negro will behave better, that he promises well, and he\r\nbelieves he will keep his promise, &c. The planters sometimes get\r\ntired of punishing a negro, and, wanting his services in the field,\r\nthey get some white person to come, and, in the presence of the slave,\r\nintercede for him. At one time a negro, named Charles, was confined in\r\nthe stocks in the building where I was at work, and had been severely\r\nwhipped several times. He begged me to intercede for him and try to\r\nget him released. I told him I would; and when his master came in to\r\nwhip him again, I went up to him and told him I had been talking with\r\nCharles, and he had promised to behave better, &c., and requested him\r\nnot to punish him any more, but to let him go. He then said to\r\nCharles, \"As Mr. Caulkins has been pleading for you, I will let you go\r\non his account;\" and accordingly released him.\r\n\r\nWomen are generally shown some little indulgence for three or four\r\nweeks previous to childbirth; they are at such times not often\r\npunished if they do not finish the task assigned them; it is, in some\r\ncases, passed over with a severe reprimand, and sometimes without any\r\nnotice being taken of it. They ate generally allowed four weeks after\r\nthe birth of a child, before they are compelled to go into the field,\r\nthey then take the child with them, attended sometimes by a little\r\ngirl or boy, from the age of four to six, to take care of it while the\r\nmother is at work. When there is no child that can be spared, or not\r\nyoung enough for this service, the mother, after nursing, lays it\r\nunder a tree, or by the side of a fence, and goes to her task,\r\nreturning at stated intervals to nurse it. While I was on this\r\nplantation, a little negro girl, six years of age, destroyed the life\r\nof a child about two months old, which was left in her care. It seems\r\nthis little nurse, so called, got tired of her charge and the labor of\r\ncarrying it to the quarters at night, the mother being obliged to work\r\nas long as she could see. One evening she nursed the infant at sunset\r\nas usual, and sent it to the quarters. The little girl, on her way\r\nhome, had to cross a run or brook, which led down into the swamp; when\r\nshe came to the brook she followed it into the swamp, then took the\r\ninfant and plunged it head foremost into the water and mud, where it\r\nstuck fast; she there left it and went to the negro quarters. When the\r\nmother came in from the field, she asked the girl where the child was;\r\nshe told her she had brought it home, but did not know where it was;\r\nthe overseer was immediately informed, search was made, and it was\r\nfound as above stated, and dead. The little girl was shut up in the\r\nbarn, and confined there two or three weeks, when a speculator came\r\nalong and bought her for two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThe slaves are obliged to work from daylight till dark, as long as\r\nthey can see. When they have tasks assigned, which is often the case,\r\na few of the strongest and most expert, sometimes finish them before\r\nsunset; others will be obliged to work till eight or nine o'clock in\r\nthe evening. All must finish their tasks or take a flogging. The whip\r\nand gun, or pistol, are companions of the overseer; the former he uses\r\nvery frequently upon the negroes, during their hours of labor, without\r\nregard to age or sex. Scarcely a day passed while I was on the\r\nplantation, in which some of the slaves were not whipped; I do not\r\nmean that they were _struck a few blows_ merely, but had a _set\r\nflogging_. The same labor is commonly assigned to men and women,--such\r\nas digging ditches in the rice marshes, clearing up land, chopping\r\ncord-wood, threshing, &c. I have known the women go into the barn as\r\nsoon as they could see in the morning, and work as late as they could\r\nsee at night, threshing rice with the flail, (they now have a\r\nthreshing machine,) and when they could see to thresh no longer, they\r\nhad to gather up the rice, carry it up stairs, and deposit it in the\r\ngranary.\r\n\r\nThe allowance of clothing on this plantation to each slave, was given\r\nout at Christmas for the year, and consisted of one pair of coarse\r\nshoes, and enough coarse cloth to make a jacket and trowsers. If the\r\nman has a wife she makes it up; if not, it is made up in the house.\r\nThe slaves on this plantation, being near Wilmington, procured\r\nthemselves extra clothing by working Sundays and moonlight nights,\r\ncutting cordwood in the swamps, which they had to back about a quarter\r\nof a mile to the ricer; they would then get a permit from their\r\nmaster, and taking the wood in their canoes, carry it to Wilmington,\r\nand sell it to the vessels, or dispose of it as they best could, and\r\nwith the money buy an old jacket of the sailors, some coarse cloth for\r\na shirt, &c. They sometimes gather the moss from the trees, which they\r\ncleanse and take to market. The women receive their allowance of the\r\nsame kind of cloth which the men have. This they make into a frock; if\r\nthey have any under garments _they must procure them for themselves_.\r\nWhen the slaves get a permit to leave the plantation, they sometimes\r\nmake all ring again by singing the following significant ditty, which\r\nshows that after all there is a flow of spirits in the human breast\r\nwhich for a while, at least, enables them to forget their\r\nwretchedness.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nHurra, for good ole Massa,\r\n    He giv me de pass to go to de city\r\nHurra, for good ole Missis,\r\n    She bile de pot, and giv me de licker.\r\n                        Hurra, I'm goin to de city.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Slaves sometimes sing, and so do convicts in jails under\r\nsentence, and both for the same reason. Their singing proves that they\r\n_want_ to be happy not that they _are_ so. It is the _means_ that they\r\nuse to make themselves happy, not the evidence that they are so\r\nalready. Sometimes, doubtless, the excitement of song whelms their\r\nmisery in momentary oblivion. He who argues from this that they have\r\nno conscious misery to forget, knows as little of human nature as of\r\nslavery.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nEvery Saturday night the slaves receive their allowance of provisions,\r\nwhich must last them till the next Saturday night. \"Potatoe time,\" as\r\nit is called, begins about the middle of July. The slave may measure\r\nfor himself, the overseer being present, half a bushel of sweet\r\npotatoes, and heap the measure as long as they will lie on; I have,\r\nhowever, seen the overseer, if he think the negro is getting too many,\r\nkick the measure; and if any fall off tell him he has got his measure.\r\nNo salt is furnished them to eat with their potatoes. When rice or\r\ncorn is given, they give them a little salt; sometimes half a pint of\r\nmolasses is given, but not often. The quantity of rice, which is of\r\nthe small, broken, unsaleable kind, is one peck. When corn is given\r\nthem, their allowance is the same, and if they get it ground, (Mr.\r\nSwan had a mill on his plantation,) they must give one quart for\r\ngrinding, thus reducing their weekly allowance to seven quarts. When\r\nfish (mullet) were plenty, they were allowed, in addition, one fish.\r\nAs to meat, they seldom had any. I do not think they had an allowance\r\nof meat oftener than once in two or three months, and then the\r\nquantity was very small. When they went into the field to work, they\r\ntook some of the meal or rice and a pot with them; the pots were given\r\nto an old woman, who placed two poles parallel, set the pots on them,\r\nand kindled a fire underneath for cooking; she took salt with her and\r\nseasoned the messes as she thought proper. When their breakfast was\r\nready, which was generally about ten or eleven o'clock, they were\r\ncalled from labor, ate, and returned to work; in the afternoon, dinner\r\nwas prepared in the same way. They had but two meals a day while in\r\nthe field; if they wanted more, they cooked for themselves after they\r\nreturned to their quarters at night. At the time of killing hogs on\r\nthe plantation, the pluck, entrails, and blood were given to the\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nWhen I first went upon Mr. Swan's plantation, I saw a slave in\r\nshackles or fetters, which were fastened around each ankle and firmly\r\nriveted, connected together by a chain. To the middle of this chain he\r\nhad fastened a string, so as in a manner to suspend them and keep them\r\nfrom galling his ankles. This slave, whose name was Frank, was an\r\nintelligent, good looking man, and a very good mechanic. There was\r\nnothing vicious in his character, but he was one of those\r\nhigh-spirited and daring men, that whips, chains, fetters, and all the\r\nmeans of cruelty in the power of slavery, could not subdue. Mr. S. had\r\nemployed a Mr. Beckwith to repair a boat, and told him Frank was a\r\ngood mechanic, and he might have his services. Frank was sent for, his\r\n_shackles still on_. Mr. Beckwith set him to work making _trundels_,\r\n&c. I was employed in putting up a building, and after Mr. Beckwith\r\nhad done with Frank, he was sent for to assist me. Mr. Swan sent him\r\nto a blacksmith's shop and had his shackles cut off with a cold\r\nchisel. Frank was afterwards sold to a cotton planter.\r\n\r\nI will relate one circumstance, which shows the little regard that is\r\npaid to the feelings of the slave. During the time that Mr. Isaiah\r\nRogers was superintending the building of a rice machine, one of the\r\nslaves complained of a severe toothache. Swan asked Mr. Rogers to take\r\nhis hammer and _knock out the tooth_.\r\n\r\nThere was a slave on the plantation named Ben, a waiting man. I\r\noccupied a room in the same hut, and had frequent conversations with\r\nhim. Ben was a kind-hearted man, and, I believe, a Christian; he would\r\nalways ask a blessing before he sat down to eat, and was in the\r\nconstant practice of praying morning and night.--One day when I was at\r\nthe hut, Ben was sent for to go to the house. Ben sighed deeply and\r\nwent. He soon returned with a girl about seventeen years of age, whom\r\none of Mr. Swan's daughters had ordered him to flog. He brought her\r\ninto the room where I was, and told her to stand there while he went\r\ninto the next room: I heard him groan again as he went. While there I\r\nheard his voice, and he was engaged in prayer. After a few minutes he\r\nreturned with a large cowhide, and stood before the girl, without\r\nsaying a word. I concluded he wished me to leave the hut, which I did;\r\nand immediately after I heard the girl scream. At every blow she would\r\nshriek, \"Do, Ben! oh do, Ben!\" This is a common expression of the\r\nslaves to the person whipping them: \"Do, Massa!\" or, \"Do, Missus!\"\r\n\r\nAfter she had gone, I asked Ben what she was whipped for: he told me\r\nshe had done something to displease her young missus; and in boxing\r\nher ears, and otherwise beating her, she had scratched her finger by a\r\npin in the girl's dress, for which she sent her to be flogged. I asked\r\nhim if he stripped her before flogging; he said, yes; he did not like\r\nto do this, but was _obliged_ to: he said he was once ordered to whip\r\na woman, which he did without stripping her: on her return to the\r\nhouse, her mistress examined her back; and not seeing any marks, he\r\nwas sent for, and asked why he had not whipped her: he replied that he\r\nhad; she said she saw no marks, and asked him if he had made her pull\r\nher clothes off; he said, No. She then told him, that when he whipped\r\nany more of the women, he must make them strip off their clothes, as\r\nwell as the men, and flog them on their bare backs, or he should be\r\nflogged himself.\r\n\r\nBen often appeared very gloomy and sad: I have frequently heard him,\r\nwhen in his room, mourning over his condition, and exclaim, \"Poor\r\nAfrican slave! Poor African slave!\" Whipping was so common an\r\noccurrence on this plantation, that it would be too great a repetition\r\nto state the _many_ and _severe_ floggings I have seen inflicted on\r\nthe slaves. They were flogged for not performing their tasks, for\r\nbeing careless, slow, or not in time, for going to the fire to warm,\r\n&c. &c.; and it often seemed as if occasions were sought as an excuse\r\nfor punishing them.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, I heard the overseer charge the hands to be at a\r\ncertain place the next morning at sun-rise. I was present in the\r\nmorning, in company with my brother, when the hands arrived. Joe, the\r\nslave already spoken of, came running, all out of breath, about five\r\nminutes behind the time, when, without asking any questions, the\r\noverseer told him to take off his jacket. Joe took off his jacket. He\r\nhad on a piece of a shirt; he told him to take it off: Joe took it\r\noff: he then whipped him with a heavy cowhide full six feet long. At\r\nevery stroke Joe would spring from the ground, and scream, \"O my God!\r\nDo, Massa Galloway!\" My brother was so exasperated; that he turned to\r\nme and said, \"If I were Joe, I would kill the overseer if I knew I\r\nshould be shot the next minute.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter the horn blew at about four in the morning, and all the\r\nthreshers were required to be at the threshing floor in fifteen\r\nminutes after. They had to go about a quarter of a mile from their\r\nquarters. Galloway would stand near the entrance, and all who did not\r\ncome in time would get a blow over the back or head as heavy as he\r\ncould strike. I have seen him, at such times, follow after them,\r\nstriking furiously a number of blows, and every one followed by their\r\nscreams. I have seen the women go to their work after such a flogging,\r\ncrying and taking on most piteously.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to believe that human nature can endure such\r\nhardships and sufferings as the slaves have to go through: I have seen\r\nthem driven into a ditch in a rice swamp to bail out the water, in\r\norder to put down a flood-gate, when they had to break the ice, and\r\nthere stand in the water among the ice until it was bailed out. I have\r\n_often_ known the hands to be taken from the field, sent down the\r\nriver in flats or boats to Wilmington, absent from twenty-four to\r\nthirty hours, _without any thing to eat,_ no provision being made for\r\nthese occasions.\r\n\r\nGalloway kept medicine on hand, that in case any of the slaves were\r\nsick, he could give it to them without sending for the physician; but\r\nhe always kept a good look out that they did not sham sickness. When\r\nany of them excited his suspicions, he would make them take the\r\nmedicine in his presence, and would give them a rap on the top of the\r\nhead, to make them swallow it. A man once came to him, of whom he said\r\nhe was suspicious: he gave him two potions of salts, and fastened him\r\nin the stocks for the night. His medicine soon began to operate; and\r\n_there he lay in all his filth till he was taken out the next day._\r\n\r\nOne day, Mr. Swan beat a slave severely, for alleged carelessness in\r\nletting a boat get adrift. The slave was told to secure the boat:\r\nwhether he took sufficient means for this purpose I do not know; he\r\nwas not allowed to make any defence. Mr. Swan called him up, and asked\r\nwhy he did not secure the boat: he pulled off his hat and began to\r\ntell his story. Swan told him he was a damned liar, and commenced\r\nbeating him over the head with a hickory cane, and the slave retreated\r\nbackwards; Swan followed him about two rods, threshing him over the\r\nhead with the hickory as he went.\r\n\r\nAs I was one day standing near some slaves who were threshing, the\r\ndriver, thinking one of the women did not use her flail quick enough,\r\nstruck her over the head: the end of the whip hit her in the eye. I\r\nthought at the time he had put it out; but, after poulticing and\r\ndoctoring for some days, she recovered. Speaking to him about it, he\r\nsaid that he once struck a slave so as to put one of her eyes entirely\r\nout.\r\n\r\nA patrol is kept upon each estate, and every slave found off the\r\nplantation without a pass is whipped on the spot. I knew a slave who\r\nstarted without a pass, one night, for a neighboring plantation, to\r\nsee his wife: he was caught, tied to a tree, and flogged. He stated\r\nhis business to the patrol, who was well acquainted with him but all\r\nto no purpose. I spoke to the patrol about it afterwards: he said he\r\nknew the negro, that he was a very clever fellow, but he had to whip\r\nhim; for, if he let him pass, he must another, &c. He stated that he\r\nhad sometimes caught and flogged four in a night.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with Mr. Swan about runaway slaves, he stated to me\r\nthe following fact:--A slave, by the name of Luke, was owned in\r\nWilmington; he was sold to a speculator and carried to Georgia. After\r\nan absence of about two months the slave returned; he watched an\r\nopportunity to enter his old master's house when the family were\r\nabsent, no one being at home but a young waiting man. Luke went to the\r\nroom where his master kept his arms; took his gun, with some\r\nammunition, and went into the woods. On the return of his master, the\r\nwaiting man told him what had been done: this threw him into a violent\r\npassion; he swore he would kill Luke, or lose his own life. He loaded\r\nanother gun, took two men, and made search, but could not find him: he\r\nthen advertised him, offering a large reward if delivered to him or\r\nlodged in jail. His neighbors, however, advised him to offer a reward\r\nof two hundred dollars for him _dead or alive_, which he did. Nothing\r\nhowever was heard of him for some months. Mr. Swan said, one of his\r\nslaves ran away, and was gone eight or ten weeks; on his return he\r\nsaid he had found Luke, and that he had a rifle, two pistols, and a\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nI left the plantation in the spring, and returned to the north; when I\r\nwent out again, the next fall, I asked Mr. Swan if any thing had been\r\nheard of Luke; he said he was _shot_, and related to me the manner of\r\nhis death, as follows:--Luke went to one of the plantations, and\r\nentered a hut for something to eat. Being fatigued, he sat down and\r\nfell asleep. There was only a woman in the hut at the time: as soon as\r\nshe found he was asleep, she ran and told her master, who took his\r\nrifle, and called two white men on another plantation: the three, with\r\ntheir rifles, then went to the hut, and posted themselves in different\r\npositions, so that they could watch the door. When Luke waked up he\r\nwent to the door to look out, and saw them with their rifles, he\r\nstepped back and raised his gun to his face. They called to him to\r\nsurrender; and stated that they had him in their power, and said he\r\nhad better give up. He said he would not: and if they tried to take\r\nhim, he would kill one of them; for, if he gave up, he knew they would\r\nkill him, and he was determined to sell his life as dear as he could.\r\nThey told him, if he should shoot one of them, the other two would\r\ncertainly kill him: he replied, he was determined not to give up, and\r\nkept his gun moving from one to the other; and while his rifle was\r\nturned toward one, another, standing in a different direction, shot\r\nhim through the head, and he fell lifeless to the ground.\r\n\r\nThere was another slave shot while I was there; this man had run away,\r\nand had been living in the woods a long time, and it was not known\r\nwhere he was, till one day he was discovered by two men, who went on\r\nthe large island near Belvidere to hunt turkeys; they shot him and\r\ncarried his head home.\r\n\r\nIt is common to keep dogs on the plantations, to pursue and catch\r\nrunaway slaves. I was once bitten by one of them. I went to the\r\noverseer's house, the dog lay in the piazza, as soon as I put my foot\r\nupon the floor, he sprang and bit me just above the knee, but not\r\nseverely; he tore my pantaloons badly. The overseer apologized for his\r\ndog, saying he never knew him to bite a _white_ man before. He said he\r\nonce had a dog, when he lived on another plantation, that was very\r\nuseful to him in hunting runaway negroes. He said that a slave on the\r\nplantation once ran away; as soon as he found the course he took, he\r\nput the dog on the track, and he soon came so close upon him that the\r\nman had to climb a tree, he followed with his gun, and brought the\r\nslave home.\r\n\r\nThe slaves have a great dread of being sold and carried south. It is\r\ngenerally said, and I have no doubt of its truth, that they are much\r\nworse treated farther south.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few among the many facts related to me while I\r\nlived among the slaveholder. The names of the planters and\r\nplantations, I shall not give, _as they did not come under my own\r\nobservation_. I however place the fullest confidence in their truth.\r\n\r\nA planter not far from Mr. Swan's employed an overseer to whom he paid\r\n$400 a year; he became dissatisfied with him, because he did not drive\r\nthe slaves hard enough, and get more work out of them. He therefore\r\nsent to South Carolina, or Georgia, and got a man to whom he paid I\r\nbelieve $800 a year. He proved to be a cruel fellow, and drove the\r\nslaves almost to death. There was a slave on this plantation, who had\r\nrepeatedly run away, and had been severely flogged every time. The\r\nlast time he was caught, a hole was dug in the ground, and he buried\r\nup to the chin, his arms being secured down by his sides. He was kept\r\nin this situation four or five days.\r\n\r\nThe following was told me by an intimate friend; it took place on a\r\nplantation containing about one hundred slaves. One day the owner\r\nordered the women into the barn, he then went in among them, whip in\r\nhand, and told them he meant to flog them all to death; they began\r\nimmediately to cry out \"What have I done Massa? What have I done\r\nMassa?\" He replied; \"D--n you, I will let you know what you have done,\r\nyou don't breed, I haven't had a young one from one of you for several\r\nmonths.\" They told him they could not breed while they had to work in\r\nthe rice ditches. (The rice grounds are low and marshy, and have to be\r\ndrained, and while digging or clearing the ditches, the women had to\r\nwork in mud and water from one to two feet in depth; they were obliged\r\nto draw up and secure their frocks about their waist, to keep them out\r\nof the water, in this manner they frequently had to work from daylight\r\nin the morning till it was so dark they could see no longer.) After\r\nswearing and threatening for some time, he told them to tell the\r\noverseer's wife, when they got in that way, and he would put them upon\r\nthe land to work.\r\n\r\nThis same planter had a female slave who was a member of the Methodist\r\nChurch; for a slave she was intelligent and conscientious. He proposed\r\na criminal intercourse with her. She would not comply. He left her and\r\nsent for the overseer, and told him to have her flogged. It was done.\r\nNot long after, he renewed his proposal. She again refused. She was\r\nagain whipped. He then told her why she had been twice flogged, and\r\ntold her he intended to whip her till she should yield. The girl,\r\nseeing that her case was hopeless, her back smarting with the\r\nscourging she had received, and dreading a repetition, gave herself up\r\nto be the victim of his brutal lusts.\r\n\r\nOne of the slaves on another plantation, gave birth to a child which\r\nlived but two or three weeks. After its death the planter called the\r\nwoman to him, and asked her how she came to let the child die; said it\r\nwas all owing to her carelessness, and that he meant to flog her for\r\nit. She told, him with all the feeling of a mother, the circumstances\r\nof its death. But her story availed her nothing against the savage\r\nbrutality of her master. She was severely whipped. A healthy child\r\nfour months old was then considered worth $100 in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts were related to me by white persons of character\r\nand respectability. The following fact was related to me on a\r\nplantation where I have spent considerable time and where the\r\npunishment was inflicted. I have no doubt of its truth. A slave ran\r\naway from his master, and got as far as Newbern. He took provisions\r\nthat lasted him a week; but having eaten all, he went to a house to\r\nget something to satisfy his hunger. A white man suspecting him to be\r\na runaway, demanded his pass; as he had none he was seized and put in\r\nNewbern jail. He was there advertised, his description given, &c. His\r\nmaster saw the advertisement and sent for him; when he was brought\r\nback, his wrists were tied together and drawn over his knees. A stick\r\nwas then passed over his arms and under his knees, and he secured in\r\nthis manner, his trowsers were then stripped down, and he turned over\r\non his side, and severely beaten with the paddle, then turned over and\r\nseverely beaten on the other side, and then turned back again, and\r\ntortured by another bruising and beating. He was afterwards kept in\r\nthe stocks a week, and whipped every morning.\r\n\r\nTo show the disgusting pollutions of slavery, and how it covers with\r\nmoral filth every thing it touches, I will state two or three facts,\r\nwhich I have on such evidence I cannot doubt their truth. A planter\r\noffered a white man of my acquaintance twenty dollars for every one of\r\nhis female slaves, whom he would get in the family way. This offer was\r\nno doubt made for the purpose of improving the stock, on the same\r\nprinciple that farmers endeavour to improve their cattle by crossing\r\nthe breed.\r\n\r\nSlaves belonging to merchants and others in the city, often hire their\r\nown time, for which they pay various prices per week or month,\r\naccording to the capacity of the slave. The females who thus hire\r\ntheir time, pursue various modes to procure the money; their masters\r\nmaking no inquiry how they get it, provided the money comes. If it is\r\nnot regularly paid they are flogged. Some take in washing, some cook\r\non board vessels, pick oakum, sell peanuts, &c., while others, younger\r\nand more comely, often resort to the vilest pursuits. I knew a man\r\nfrom the north who, though married to a respectable southern woman,\r\nkept two of these mulatto girls in an upper room at his store; his\r\nwife told some of her friends that he had not lodged at home for two\r\nweeks together, I have seen these two _kept misses_, as they are there\r\ncalled, at his store; he was afterwards stabbed in an attempt to\r\narrest a runaway slave, and died in about ten days.\r\n\r\nThe clergy at the north cringe beneath the corrupting influence of\r\nslavery, and their moral courage is borne down by it. Not the\r\nhypocritical and unprincipled alone, but even such as can hardly be\r\nsupposed to be destitute of sincerity.\r\n\r\nGoing one morning to the Baptist Sunday School, in Wilmington, in\r\nwhich I was engaged, I fell in with the Rev. Thomas P. Hunt, who was\r\ngoing to the Presbyterian school. I asked him how he could bear to see\r\nthe little negro children beating their hoops, hallooing, and running\r\nabout the streets, as we then saw them, their moral condition entirely\r\nneglected, while the whites were so carefully gathered into the\r\nschools. His reply was substantially this:--\"I can't bear it, Mr.\r\nCaulkins. I feel as deeply as any one can on this subject, but what\r\ncan I do? MY HANDS ARE TIED.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if Mr. Hunt was guilty of neglecting his duty, as a servant of\r\nHIM who never failed to rebuke sin in high places, what shall be said\r\nof those clergymen at the north, where the power that closed his mouth\r\nis comparatively unfelt, who refuse to tell their people how God\r\nabhors oppression, and who seldom open their mouth on this subject,\r\nbut to denounce the friends of emancipation, thus giving the strongest\r\nsupport to the accursed system of slavery. I believe Mr. Hunt has\r\nsince become an agent of the Temperance Society.\r\n\r\nIn stating the foregoing facts, my object has been to show the\r\npractical workings of the system of slavery, and if possible to\r\ncorrect the misapprehension on this subject, so common at the north.\r\nIn doing this I am not at war with slave-holders. No, my soul is moved\r\nfor them as well as for the poor slaves. May God send them repentance\r\nto the acknowledgment of the truth! Principle, on a subject of this\r\nnature, is dearer to me than the applause of men, and should not be\r\nsacrificed on any subject, even though the ties of friendship may be\r\nbroken. We have too long been silent on this subject, the slave has\r\nbeen too much considered, by our northern states, as being kept by\r\nnecessity in his present condition.--Were we to ask, in the language\r\nof Pilate, \"what evil have they done\"--we may search their history, we\r\ncannot find that they have taken up arms against our government, nor\r\ninsulted us as a nation--that they are thus compelled to drag out a\r\nlife in chains! subjected to the most terrible inflictions if in any\r\nway they manifest a wish to be released.--Let us reverse the question.\r\nWhat evil has been done to them by those who call themselves masters?\r\nFirst let us look at their persons, \"neither clothed nor naked\"--I\r\nhave seen instances where this phrase would not apply to boys and\r\ngirls, and that too in winter. I knew one young man seventeen years of\r\nage, by the name of Dave, on Mr. J. Swan's plantation, worked day\r\nafter day in the rice machine as naked as when he was born. The reason\r\nof his being so, his master said in my hearing, was, that he could not\r\nkeep clothes on him--he would get into the fire and burn them off.\r\n\r\nFollow them next to their huts; some with and some without floors:--Go\r\nat night, view their means of lodging, see them lying on benches, some\r\non the floor or ground, some sitting on stools, dozing away the\r\nnight:--others, of younger age, with a bare blanket wrapped about\r\nthem; and one or two lying in the ashes. These things _I have often\r\nseen with my own eyes._\r\n\r\nExamine their means of subsistence, which consists generally of seven\r\nquarts of meal or eight quarts of small rice for one week; then follow\r\nthem to their work, with driver and overseer pushing them to the\r\nutmost of their strength, by threatening and whipping.\r\n\r\nIf they are sick from fatigue and exposure, go to their huts, as I\r\nhave often been, and see them groaning under a burning fever or\r\npleurisy, lying on some straw, their feet to the fire with barely a\r\nblanket to cover them; or on some boards nailed together in form of a\r\nbedstead.\r\n\r\nAnd after seeing all this, and hearing them tell of their sufferings,\r\nneed I ask, is there any evil connected with their condition? and if\r\nso; upon whom is it to be charged? I answer for myself, and the reader\r\ncan do the same. Our government stands first chargeable for allowing\r\nslavery to exist, under its own jurisdiction. Second, the states for\r\nenacting laws to secure their victim. Third, the slaveholder for\r\ncarrying out such enactments, in horrid form enough to chill the\r\nblood. Fourth, every person who knows what slavery is, and does not\r\nraise his voice against this crying sin, but by silence gives consent\r\nto its continuance, is chargeable with guilt in the sight of God. \"The\r\nblood of Zacharias who was slain between the temple and altar,\" says\r\nChrist, \"WILL I REQUIRE OF THIS GENERATION.\"\r\n\r\nLook at the slave, his condition but little, if at all, better than\r\nthat of the brute; chained down by the law, and the will of his\r\nmaster; and every avenue closed against relief; and the names of those\r\nwho plead for him, cast out as evil;--must not humanity let its voice\r\nbe heard, and tell Israel their transgressions and Judah their sins?\r\n\r\nMay God look upon their afflictions, and deliver them from their cruel\r\ntask-masters! I verily believe he will, if there be any efficacy in\r\nprayer. I have been to their prayer meetings and with them offered\r\nprayer in their behalf. I have heard some of them in their huts before\r\nday-light praying in their simple broken language, telling their\r\nheavenly Father of their trials in the following and similar language.\r\n\r\n\"Fader in heaven, look upon de poor slave, dat have to work all de day\r\nlong, dat cant have de time to pray only in de night, and den massa\r\nmus not know it.[2] Fader, have mercy on massa and missus. Fader, when\r\nshall poor slave get through de world! when will death come, and de\r\npoor slave go to heaven;\" and in their meetings they frequently add,\r\n\"Fader, bless de white man dat come to hear de slave pray, bless his\r\nfamily,\" and so on. They uniformly begin their meetings by singing the\r\nfollowing--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And are we yet alive\r\n To see each other's face,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: At this time there was some fear of insurrection and the\r\nslaves were forbidden to hold meetings.]\r\n\r\nIs the ear of the Most High deaf to the prayer of the slave? I do\r\nfirmly believe that their deliverance will come, and that the prayer\r\nof this poor afflicted people will be answered.\r\n\r\nEmancipation would be safe. I have had eleven winters to learn the\r\ndisposition of the slaves, and am satisfied that they would peaceably\r\nand cheerfully work for pay. Give them education, equal and just laws,\r\nand they will become a most interesting people. Oh, let a cry be\r\nraised which shall awaken the conscience of this guilty nation, to\r\ndemand for the slaves immediate and unconditional emancipation.\r\n                                   NEHEMIAH CAULKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE AND TESTIMONY OF REV. HORACE MOULTON.\r\n\r\nMr. Moulton is an esteemed minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church,\r\nin Marlborough, Mass. He spent five years in Georgia, between 1817 and\r\n1824. The following communication has been recently received from him.\r\n\r\nMARLBOROUGH, MASS., Feb. 18, 1839.\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER--\r\n\r\nYours of Feb. 2d, requesting me to write out a few facts on the\r\nsubject of slavery, as it exists at the south, has come to hand. I\r\nhasten to comply with your request. Were it not, however, for the\r\nclaims of those \"who are drawn unto death,\" and the responsibility\r\nresting upon me, in consequence of this request, I should forever hold\r\nmy peace. For I well know that I shall bring upon myself a flood of\r\npersecution, for attempting to speak out for the dumb. But I am\r\nwilling to be set at nought by men, if I can be the means of promoting\r\nthe welfare of the oppressed of our land. I shall not relate many\r\nparticular cases of cruelty, though I might a great number; but shall\r\ngive some general information as to their mode of treatment, their\r\nfood, clothing, dwellings, deprivations, &c.\r\n\r\nLet me say, in the first place, that I spent nearly five years in\r\nSavannah, Georgia, and in its vicinity, between the years 1817 and\r\n1824. My object in going to the south, was to engage in making and\r\nburning brick; but not immediately succeeding, I engaged in no\r\nbusiness of much profit until late in the winter, when I took charge\r\nof a set of hands and went to work. During my leisure, however, I was\r\nan observer, at the auctions, upon the plantations, and in almost\r\nevery department of business. The next year, during the cold months, I\r\nhad several two-horse teams under my care, with which we used to haul\r\nbrick, boards, and other articles from the wharf into the city, and\r\ncotton, rice, corn, and wood from the country. This gave me an\r\nextensive acquaintance with merchants, mechanics and planters. I had\r\nslaves under my control some portions of every year when at the south.\r\nAll the brick-yards, except one, on which I was engaged, were\r\nconnected either with a corn field, potatoe patch, rice field, cotton\r\nfield, tan-works, or with a wood lot. My business, usually, was to\r\ntake charge of the brick-making department. At those jobs I have\r\nsometimes taken in charge both the field and brick-yard hands. I have\r\nbeen on the plantations in South Carolina, but have never been an\r\noverseer of slaves in that state, as has been said in the public\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nI think the above facts and explanations are necessary to be connected\r\nwith the account I may give of slavery, that the reader may have some\r\nknowledge of my acquaintance with _practical_ slavery: for many\r\nmechanics and merchants who go to the South, and stay there for years,\r\nknow but little of the dark side of slavery. My account of slavery\r\nwill apply to _field hands_, who compose much the largest portion of\r\nthe black population, (probably nine-tenths,) and not to those who are\r\nkept for kitchen maids, nurses, waiters, &c., about the houses of the\r\nplanters and public hotels, where persons from the north obtain most\r\nof their knowledge of the evils of slavery. I will now proceed to take\r\nup specific points.\r\n\r\nTHE LABOR OF THE SLAVES\r\n\r\nMales and females work together promiscuously on all the plantations.\r\nOn many plantations _tasks_ are given them. The best working hands can\r\nhave some leisure time; but the feeble and unskilful ones, together\r\nwith slender females, have indeed a hard time of it, and very often\r\nanswer for non-performance of tasks at the _whipping-posts_. None who\r\nworked with me had tasks at any time. The rule was to work them from\r\nsun to sun. But when I was burning brick, they were obliged to take\r\nturns, and _sit up all night_ about every other night, and work all\r\nday. On one plantation, where I spent a few weeks, the slaves were\r\ncalled up to work long before daylight, when business pressed, and\r\nworked until late at night; and sometimes some of them _all night_. A\r\nlarge portion of the slaves are owned by masters who keep them on\r\npurpose to hire out--and they usually let them to those who will give\r\nthe highest wages for them, irrespective of their mode of treatment;\r\nand those who hire them, will of course try to get the greatest\r\npossible amount of work performed, with the least possible expense.\r\nWomen are seen bringing their infants into the field to their work,\r\nand leading others who are not old enough to stay at the cabins with\r\nsafety. When they get there, they must set them down in the dirt and\r\ngo to work. Sometimes they are left to cry until they fall asleep.\r\nOthers are left at home, shut up in their huts. Now, is it not\r\nbarbarous, that the mother, with her child of children around her,\r\nhalf starved, must be whipped at night if she does not perform her\r\ntask? But so it is. Some who have very young ones, fix a little sack,\r\nand place the infants on their backs, and work. One reason, I presume\r\nis, that they will not cry so much when they can hear their mother's\r\nvoice. Another is, the mothers fear that the poisonous vipers and\r\nsnakes will bite them. Truly, I never knew any place where the land is\r\nso infested with all kinds of the most venomous snakes, as in the low\r\nlands round about Savannah. The moccasin snakes, so called, and water\r\nrattle-snakes--the bites of both of which are as poisonous as our\r\nupland rattlesnakes at the north,--are found in myriads about the\r\nstagnant waters and swamps of the South. The females, in order to\r\nsecure their infants from these poisonous snakes, do, as I have said,\r\noften work with their infants on their backs. Females are sometimes\r\ncalled to take the hardest part of the work. On some brick yards where\r\nI have been, the women have been selected as the _moulders_ of brick,\r\ninstead of the men.\r\n\r\nII. THE FOOD OF THE SLAVES.\r\n\r\nIt was a general custom, wherever I have been, for the masters to give\r\neach of his slaves, male and female, _one peck of corn per week_ for\r\ntheir food. This at fifty cents per bushel, which was all that it was\r\nworth when I was there, would amount to twelve and a half cents per\r\nweek for board per head.\r\n\r\nIt cost me upon an average, when at the south, one dollar per day for\r\nboard. The price of fourteen bushels of corn per week. This would make\r\nmy board equal in amount to the board of _forty-six slaves!_ This is\r\nall that good or bad masters allow their slaves round about Savannah\r\non the plantations. One peck of gourd-seed corn is to be measured out\r\nto each slave once every week. One man with whom I labored, however,\r\nbeing desirous to get all the work out of his hands he could, before I\r\nleft, (about fifty in number,) bought for them every week, or twice a\r\nweek, a beef's head from market. With this, they made a soup in a\r\nlarge iron kettle, around which the hands came at meal-time, and\r\ndipping out the soup, would mix it with their hommony, and eat it as\r\nthough it were a feast. This man permitted his slaves to eat twice a\r\nday while I was doing a job for him. He promised me a beaver hat and\r\nas good a suit of clothes as could be bought in the city, if I would\r\naccomplish so much for him before I returned to the north; giving me\r\nthe entire control over his slaves. Thus you may see the temptations\r\noverseers sometimes have, to get all the work they can out of the poor\r\nslaves. The above is an exception to the general rule of feeding. For\r\nin all other places where I worked and visited; the slaves had\r\n_nothing from their masters but the corn_, or its equivalent in\r\npotatoes or rice, and to this, they were not permitted to come but\r\n_once a day_. The custom was to blow the horn early in the morning,\r\nas a signal for the hands to rise and go to work, when commenced; they\r\ncontinued work until about eleven o'clock, A.M., when, at the signal,\r\nall hands left off and went into their huts, made their fires, made\r\ntheir corn-meal into hommony or cake, ate it, and went to work again\r\nat the signal of the horn, and worked until night, or until their\r\ntasks were done. Some cooked their breakfast in the field while at\r\nwork. Each slave must grind his own corn in a hand-mill after he has\r\ndone his work at night. There is generally one hand-mill on every\r\nplantation for the use of the slaves.\r\n\r\nSome of the planters have no corn, others often get out. The\r\nsubstitute for it is, the equivalent of one peek of corn either in\r\nrice or sweet potatoes; neither of which is as good for the slaves as\r\ncorn. They complain more of being faint, when fed on rice or potatoes,\r\nthan when fed on corn. I was with one man a few weeks who gave me his\r\nhands to do a job of work, and to save time one cooked for all the\r\nrest. The following course was taken,--Two crotched sticks were driven\r\ndown at one end of the yard, and a small pole being laid on the\r\ncrotches, they swung a large iron kettle on the middle of the pole;\r\nthen made up a fire under the kettle and boiled the hommony; when\r\nready, the hands were called around this kettle with their wooden\r\nplates and spoons. They dipped out and ate standing around the kettle,\r\nor sitting upon the ground, as best suited their convenience. When\r\nthey had potatoes they took them out with their hands, and ate them.\r\nAs soon as it was thought they had had sufficient time to swallow\r\ntheir food they were called to their work again. _This was the only\r\nmeal they ate through the day._ now think of the little, almost naked\r\nand half starved children, nibbling upon a piece of cold Indian cake,\r\nor a potato! Think of the poor female, just ready to be confined,\r\nwithout any thing that can be called convenient or comfortable! Think\r\nof the old toil-worn father and mother, without anything to eat but\r\nthe coarsest of food, and not half enough of that! then think of\r\n_home_. When sick, their physicians are their masters and overseers,\r\nin most cases, whose skill consists in bleeding and in administering\r\nlarge potions of Epsom salts, when the whip and _cursing_ will not\r\nstart them from their cabins.\r\n\r\nIII. HOUSES.\r\n\r\nThe huts of the slaves are mostly of the poorest kind. They are not as\r\ngood as those temporary shanties which are thrown up beside railroads.\r\nThey are erected with posts and crotches, with but little or no\r\nframe-work about them. They have no stoves or chimneys; some of them\r\nhave something like a fireplace at one end, and a board or two off at\r\nthat side, or on the roof, to let off the smoke. Others have nothing\r\nlike a fireplace in them; in these the fire is sometimes made in the\r\nmiddle of the hut. These buildings have but one apartment in them; the\r\nplaces where they pass in and out, serve both for doors and windows;\r\nthe sides and roofs are covered with coarse, and in many instances\r\nwith refuse boards. In warm weather, especially in the spring, the\r\nslaves keep up a smoke, or fire and smoke, all night, to drive away\r\nthe gnats and musketoes, which are very troublesome in all the low\r\ncountry of the south; so much so that the whites sleep under frames\r\nwith nets over them, knit so fine that the musketoes cannot fly\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nSome of the slaves have rugs to cover them in the coldest weather, but\r\nI should think _more have not_. During driving storms they frequently\r\nhave to run from one hut to another for shelter. In the coldest\r\nweather, where they can get wood or stumps, they keep up fires all\r\nnight in their huts, and lay around them, with their feet towards the\r\nblaze. Men, women and children all lie down together, in most\r\ninstances. There may be exceptions to the above statements in regard\r\nto their houses, but so far as my observations have extended, I have\r\ngiven a fair description, and I have been on a large number of\r\nplantations in Georgia and South Carolina up and down the Savannah\r\nriver. Their huts are generally built compactly on the plantations,\r\nforming villages of huts, their size proportioned to the number of\r\nslaves on them. In these miserable huts the poor blacks are herded at\r\nnight like swine, _without any conveniences of beadsteads, tables or\r\nchairs._ O Misery to the full! to see the aged sire beating off the\r\nswarms of gnats and musketoes in the warm weather, and shivering in\r\nthe straw, or bending over a few coals in the winter, clothed in rags.\r\nI should think males and females, both lie down at night with their\r\nworking clothes on them. God alone knows how much the poor slaves\r\nsuffer for the want of convenient houses to secure them from the\r\npiercing winds and howling storms of winter, almost as much in Georgia\r\nas I do in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIV. CLOTHING.\r\n\r\nThe masters [in Georgia] make a practice of getting two suits of\r\nclothes for each slave per year, a thick suit for winter, and a thin\r\none for summer. They provide also one pair of northern made sale shoes\r\nfor each slave in _winter_. These shoes usually begin to rip in a few\r\nweeks. The negroes' mode of mending them is, to _wire_ them together,\r\nin many instances. Do our northern shoemakers know that they are\r\naugmenting the sufferings of the poor slaves with their almost good\r\nfor nothing sale shoes? Inasmuch as it is done unto one of those poor\r\nsufferers it is done unto our Saviour. The above practice of clothing\r\nthe slave is customary to some extent. How many, however, fail of\r\nthis, God only knows. The children and old slaves are, I should think,\r\n_exceptions_ to the above rule. The males and females have their suits\r\nfrom the same cloth for their winter dresses. These winter garments\r\nappear to be made of a mixture of cotton and wool, very coarse and\r\n_sleazy_. The whole suit for the men consists of a pair of pantaloons\r\nand a short sailor-jacket, _without shirt, vest, hat, stockings, or\r\nany kind of loose garments!_ These, if worn steadily when at work,\r\nwould not probably last more than one or two months; therefore, for\r\nthe sake of saving them, many of them work, especially in the summer,\r\nwith no clothing on them except a cloth tied round their waist, and\r\n_almost all_ with nothing more on them than pantaloons, and these\r\nfrequently so torn that they do not serve the purposes of common\r\ndecency. The women have for clothing a short petticoat, and a short\r\nloose gown, something like the male's sailor-jacket, _without any\r\nunder garment, stockings, bonnets, hoods, caps, or any kind of\r\nover-clothes._ When at work in the warm weather, they usually strip\r\noff the loose gown, and have nothing on but a short petticoat with\r\nsome kind of covering over their breasts. Many children may be seen in\r\nthe summer months _as naked as they came into the world_. I think, as\r\na whole, they suffer more for the want of comfortable bed clothes,\r\nthan they do for wearing apparel. It is true, that some by begging or\r\nbuying have more clothes than above described, but the _masters\r\nprovide them with no more_. They are miserable objects of pity. It may\r\nbe said of many of them, \"I was _naked_ and ye clothed me not.\" It is\r\nenough to melt the hardest heart to see the ragged mothers nursing\r\ntheir almost naked children, with but a morsel of the coarsest food to\r\neat. The Southern horses and dogs have enough to eat and good care\r\ntaken of them, but Southern negroes, who can describe their misery?\r\n\r\nV. PUNISHMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary mode of punishing the slaves is both cruel and barbarous.\r\nThe masters seldom, if ever, try to govern their slaves by moral\r\ninfluence, but by whipping, kicking, beating, starving, branding,\r\n_cat-hauling_, loading with irons, imprisoning, or by some other cruel\r\nmode of torturing. They often boast of having invented some new mode\r\nof torture, by which they have \"tamed the rascals,\" What is called a\r\nmoderate flogging at the south is horribly cruel. Should we whip our\r\nhorses for any offence as they whip their slaves for small offences,\r\nwe should expose ourselves to the penalty of the law. The masters whip\r\nfor the smallest offences, such as not performing their tasks, being\r\ncaught by the guard or patrol by night, or for taking any thing from\r\nthe master's yard without leave. For these, and the like crimes, the\r\nslaves are whipped thirty-nine lashes, and sometimes seventy or a\r\nhundred, on the bare back. One slave, who was under my care, was\r\nwhipped, I think one hundred lashes, for getting a small handful of\r\nwood from his master's yard without leave. I heard an overseer\r\nboasting to this same master that he gave one of the boys seventy\r\nlashes, for not doing a job of work just as he thought it ought to be\r\ndone. The owner of the slave appeared to be pleased that the overseer\r\nhad been so faithful. The apology they make for whipping so cruelly\r\nis, that it is to frighten the rest of the gang. The masters say, that\r\nwhat we call an ordinary flogging will not subdue the slaves; hence\r\nthe most cruel and barbarous scourgings ever witnessed by man are\r\ndaily and _hourly_ inflicted upon the naked bodies of these miserable\r\nbondmen; not by masters and negro-drivers only, but by the constables\r\nin the common markets and jailors in their yards.\r\n\r\nWhen the slaves are whipped, either in public or private, they have\r\ntheir hands fastened by the wrists, with a rope or cord prepared for\r\nthe purpose: this being thrown over a beam, a limb of a tree, or\r\nsomething else, the culprit is drawn up and stretched by the arms as\r\nhigh as possible, without raising his feet from the ground or floor:\r\nand sometimes they are made to stand on tip-toe; then the feet are\r\nmade fast to something prepared for them. In this distorted posture\r\nthe monster flies at them, sometimes in great rage, with his\r\nimplements of torture, and cuts on with all his might, over the\r\nshoulders, under the arms, and sometimes over the head and ears, or on\r\nparts of the body where he can inflict the greatest torment.\r\nOccasionally the whipper, especially if his victim does not beg enough\r\nto suit him, while under the lash, will fly into a passion, uttering\r\nthe most horrid oaths; while the victim of his rage is crying, at\r\nevery stroke, \"Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy!\" The scenes exhibited\r\nat the whipping post are awfully terrific and frightful to one whose\r\nheart has not turned to stone; I never could look on but a moment.\r\nWhile under the lash, the bleeding victim writhes in agony, convulsed\r\nwith torture. Thirty-nine lashes on the bare back, which tear the skin\r\nat almost every stroke, is what the South calls a very _moderate\r\npunishment!_ Many masters whip until they are tired--until the back is\r\na gore of blood--then rest upon it: after a short cessation, get up\r\nand go at it again; and after having satiated their revenge in the\r\nblood of their victims, they sometimes _leave them tied, for hours\r\ntogether, bleeding at every wound_.--Sometimes, after being whipped,\r\nthey are bathed with a brine of salt and water. Now and then a master,\r\nbut more frequently a mistress who has no husband, will send them to\r\njail a few days, giving orders to have them whipped, so many lashes,\r\nonce or twice a day. Sometimes, after being whipped, some have been\r\nshut up in a dark place and deprived of food, in order to increase\r\ntheir torments: and I have heard of some who have, in such\r\ncircumstances, died of their wounds and starvation.\r\n\r\nSuch scenes of horror as above described are so common in Georgia that\r\nthey attract no attention. To threaten them with death, with breaking\r\nin their teeth or jaws, or cracking their heads, is _common talk_,\r\nwhen scolding at the slaves.--Those who run away from their masters\r\nand are caught again generally fare the worst. They are generally\r\nlodged in jail, with instructions from the owner to have them cruelly\r\nwhipped. Some order the constables to whip them publicly in the\r\nmarket. Constables at the south are generally savage, brutal men. They\r\nhave become so accustomed to catching and whipping negroes, that they\r\nare as fierce as tigers. Slaves who are absent from their yards, or\r\nplantations, after eight o'clock P.M., and are taken by the guard in\r\nthe cities, or by the patrols in the country, are, if not called for\r\nbefore nine o'clock A.M. the next day, secured in prisons; and hardly\r\never escape, until their backs are torn up by the cowhide. On\r\nplantations, the _evenings_ usually present scenes of horror. Those\r\nslaves against whom charges are preferred for not having performed\r\ntheir tasks, and for various faults, must, after work-hours at night,\r\nundergo their torments. I have often heard the sound of the lash, the\r\ncurses of the whipper, and the cries of the poor negro rending the\r\nair, late in the evening, and long before day-light in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt is very common for masters to say to the overseers or drivers, \"put\r\nit on to them,\" \"don't spare that fellow,\" \"give that scoundrel one\r\nhundred lashes,\" &c. Whipping the women when in delicate\r\ncircumstances, as they sometimes do, without any regard to their\r\nentreaties or the entreaties of their nearest friends, is truly\r\nbarbarous. If negroes could testify, they would tell you of instances\r\nof women being whipped until they have miscarried at the\r\nwhipping-post. I heard of such things at the south--they are\r\nundoubtedly facts. Children are whipped unmercifully for the smallest\r\noffences, and that before their mothers. A large proportion of the\r\nblacks have their shoulders, backs, and arms all scarred up, and not a\r\nfew of them have had their heads laid open with clubs, stones, and\r\nbrick-bats, and with the butt-end of whips and canes--some have had\r\ntheir jaws broken, others their teeth knocked in or out; while others\r\nhave had their ears cropped and the sides of their cheeks gashed out.\r\nSome of the poor creatures have lost the sight of one of their eyes by\r\nthe careless blows of the whipper, or by some other violence.\r\n\r\nBut punishing of slaves as above described, is not the only mode of\r\ntorture. Some tie them up in a very uneasy posture, where they must\r\nstand _all night_, and they will then work them hard all day--that is,\r\nwork them hard all day and torment them all night. Others punish by\r\nfastening them down on a log, or something else, and strike them on\r\nthe bare skin with a board paddle full of holes. This breaks the skin,\r\nI should presume, at every hole where it comes in contact with it.\r\nOthers, when other modes of punishment will not subdue them,\r\n_cat-haul_ them--that is, take a cat by the nape of the neck and tail,\r\nor by the hind legs, and drag the claws across the back until\r\nsatisfied. This kind of punishment poisons the flesh much worse than\r\nthe whip, and is more dreaded by the slave. Some are branded by a hot\r\niron, others have their flesh cut out in large gashes, to mark them.\r\nSome who are prone to run away, have iron fetters riveted around their\r\nancles, sometimes they are put only on one foot, and are dragged on\r\nthe ground. Others have on large iron collars or yokes upon their\r\nnecks, or clogs riveted upon their wrists or ancles. Some have bells\r\nput upon them, hung upon a sort of frame to an iron collar. Some\r\nmasters fly into a rage at trifles and knock down their negroes with\r\ntheir fists, or with the first thing that they can get hold of. The\r\nwhiplash-knots, or rawhide, have sometimes by a reckless stroke\r\nreached round to the front of the body and cut through to the bowels.\r\nOne slaveholder with whom I lived, whipped one of his slaves one day,\r\nas many, I should think, as one hundred lashes, and then turned the\r\n_butt-end_ and went to beating him over the head and ears, and truly I\r\nwas amazed that the slave was not killed on the spot. Not a few\r\nslaveholders whip their slaves to death, and then say that they died\r\nunder a \"moderate correction.\" I wonder that ten are not killed where\r\none is! Were they not much hardier than the whites many more of them\r\nmust die than do. One young mulatto man, with whom I was well\r\nacquainted, was killed by his master in his yard with _impunity_. I\r\nboarded at the same time near the place where this glaring murder was\r\ncommitted, and knew the master well. He had a plantation, on which he\r\nenacted, almost daily, cruel barbarities, some of them, I was\r\ninformed, more terrific, if possible, than death itself. Little notice\r\nwas taken of this murder, and it all passed off without any action\r\nbeing taken against the murderer. The masters used to try to make me\r\nwhip their negroes. They said I could not get along with them without\r\nflogging them--but I found I could get along better with them by\r\ncoaxing and encouraging them than by beating and flogging them. I had\r\nnot a heart to beat and kick about those beings; although I had not\r\ngrace in my heart the three first years I was there, yet I sympathised\r\nwith the slaves. I never was guilty of having but one whipped, and he\r\nwas whipped but eight or nine blows. The circumstances were as\r\nfollows: Several negroes were put under my care, one spring, _who were\r\nfresh from Congo and Guinea_. I could not understand them, neither\r\ncould they me, in one word I spoke. I therefore pointed to them to go\r\nto work; all obeyed me willingly but one--he refused. I told the\r\ndriver that he must tie him up and whip him. After he had tied him, by\r\nthe help of some others, we struck him eight or nine blows, and he\r\nyielded. I told the driver not to strike him another blow. We untied\r\nhim, and he went to work, and continued faithful all the time he was\r\nwith me. This one was not a sample, however--many of them have such\r\nexalted views of freedom that it is hard work for the masters to whip\r\nthem into brutes, that is to subdue their noble spirits. The negroes\r\nbeing put under my care, did not prevent the masters from whipping\r\nthem when they pleased. But they never whipped much in my presence.\r\nThis work was usually left until I had dismissed the hands. On the\r\nplantations, the masters chose to have the slaves whipped in the\r\npresence of all the hands, to strike them with terror.\r\n\r\nVI. RUNAWAYS\r\n\r\nNumbers of poor slaves run away from their masters; some of whom\r\ndoubtless perish in the swamps and other secret places, rather than\r\nreturn back again to their masters; others stay away until they almost\r\nfamish with hunger, and then return home rather than die, while others\r\nwho abscond are caught by the negro-hunters, in various ways.\r\nSometimes the master will hire some of his most trusty negroes to\r\nsecure any stray negroes, who come on to their plantations, for many\r\ncome at night to beg food of their friends on the plantations. The\r\nslaves assist one another usually when they can, and not be found out\r\nin it. The master can now and then, however, get some of his hands to\r\nbetray the runaways. Some obtain their living in hunting after lost\r\nslaves. The most common way is to train up young dogs to follow them.\r\nThis can easily be done by obliging a slave to go out into the woods,\r\nand climb a tree, and then put the young dog on his track, and with a\r\nlittle assistance he can be taught to follow him to the tree, and when\r\nfound, of course the dog would bark at such game as a poor negro on a\r\ntree. There was a man living in Savannah when I was there, who kept a\r\nlarge number of dogs for no other purpose than to hunt runaway\r\nnegroes. And he always had enough of this work to do, for hundreds of\r\nrunaways are never found, but could he get news soon after one had\r\nfled, he was almost sure to catch him. And this fear of the dogs\r\nrestrains multitudes from running off.\r\n\r\nWhen he went out on a hunting excursion, to be gone several days, he\r\ntook several persons with him, armed generally with rifles and\r\nfollowed by the dogs. The dogs were as true to the track of a negro,\r\nif one had passed recently, as a hound is to the track of a fox when\r\nhe has found it. When the dogs draw near to their game, the slave must\r\nturn and fight them or climb a tree. If the latter, the dogs will stay\r\nand bark until the pursuer come. The blacks frequently deceive the\r\ndogs by crossing and recrossing the creeks. Should the hunters who\r\nhave no dogs, start a slave from his hiding place, and the slave not\r\nstop at the hunter's call, he will shoot at him, as soon as he would\r\nat a deer. Some masters advertise so much for a runaway slave, dead or\r\nalive. It undoubtedly gives such more satisfaction to know that their\r\nproperty is dead, than to know that it is alive without being able to\r\nget it. Some slaves run away who never mean to be taken alive. I will\r\nmention one. He run off and was pursued by the dogs, but having a\r\nweapon with him he succeeded in killing two or three of the dogs; but\r\nwas afterwards shot. He had declared, that he never would be taken\r\nalive. The people rejoiced at the death of the slave, but lamented the\r\ndeath of the dogs, they were such ravenous hunters. Poor fellow, he\r\nfought for life and liberty like a hero; but the bullets brought him\r\ndown. A negro can hardly walk unmolested at the south.--Every colored\r\nstranger that walks the streets is suspected of being a runaway slave,\r\nhence he must be interrogated by every negro hater whom he meets, and\r\nshould he not have a pass, he must be arrested and hurried off to\r\njail. Some masters boast that their slaves would not be free if they\r\ncould. How little they know of their slaves! They are all sighing and\r\ngroaning for freedom. May God hasten the time!\r\n\r\nVII. CONFINEMENT AT NIGHT.\r\n\r\nWhen the slaves have done their day's work, they must be herded\r\ntogether like sheep in their yards, or on their plantations. They have\r\nnot as much liberty as northern men have, who are sent to jail for\r\ndebt, for they have liberty to walk a larger yard than the slaves\r\nhave. The slaves must all be at their homes precisely at eight\r\no'clock, P.M. At this hour the drums beat in the cities, as a signal\r\nfor every slave to be in his den. In the country, the signal is given\r\nby firing guns, or some other way by which they may know the hour when\r\nto be at home. After this hour, the guard in the cities, and patrols\r\nin the country, being well armed, are on duty until daylight in the\r\nmorning. If they catch any negroes during the night without a pass,\r\nthey are immediately seized and hurried away to the guard-house, or if\r\nin the country to some place of confinement, where they are kept until\r\nnine o'clock, A.M., the next day, if not called for by that time, they\r\nare hurried off to jail, and there remain until called for by their\r\nmaster and his jail and guard house fees paid. The guards and patrols\r\nreceive one dollar extra for every one they can catch, who has not a\r\npass from his master, or overseer, but few masters will give their\r\nslaves passes to be out at night unless on some special business:\r\nnotwithstanding, many venture out, watching every step they take for\r\nthe guard or patrol, the consequence is, some are caught almost every\r\nnight, and some nights many are taken; some, fleeing after being\r\nhailed by the watch, are shot down in attempting their escape, others\r\nare crippled for life. I find I shall not be able to write out more at\r\npresent. My ministerial duties are pressing, and if I delay this till\r\nthe next mail, I fear it will not be in season. Your brother for those\r\nwho are in bonds,\r\n\r\nHORACE MOULTON\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE AND TESTIMONY OF SARAH M. GRIMKÉ.\r\n\r\nMiss Grimké is a daughter of the late Judge Grimké, of the Supreme\r\nCourt of South Carolina, and sister of the late Hon. Thomas S. Grimké.\r\n\r\nAs I left my native state on account of slavery, and deserted the home\r\nof my fathers to escape the sound of the lash and the shrieks of\r\ntortured victims, I would gladly bury in oblivion the recollection of\r\nthose scenes with which I have been familiar; but this may not, cannot\r\nbe; they come over my memory like gory spectres, and implore me with\r\nresistless power, in the name of a God of mercy, in the name of a\r\ncrucified Savior, in the name of humanity; for the sake of the\r\nslaveholder, as well as the slave, to bear witness to the horrors of\r\nthe southern prison house. I feel impelled by a sacred sense of duty,\r\nby my obligations to my country, by sympathy for the bleeding victims\r\nof tyranny and lust, to give my testimony respecting the system of\r\nAmerican slavery,--to detail a few facts, most of which came under my\r\n_personal observation_. And here I may premise, that the actors in\r\nthese tragedies were all men and women of the highest respectability,\r\nand of the first families in South Carolina, and, with one exception,\r\ncitizens of Charleston; and that their cruelties did not in the\r\nslightest degree affect their standing in society.\r\n\r\nA handsome mulatto woman, about 18 or 20 years of age, whose\r\nindependent spirit could not brook the degradation of slavery, was in\r\nthe habit of running away: for this offence she had been repeatedly\r\nsent by her master and mistress to be whipped by the keeper of the\r\nCharleston work-house. This had been done with such inhuman severity,\r\nas to lacerate her back in a most shocking manner; a finger could not\r\nbe laid between the cuts. But the love of liberty was too strong to be\r\nannihilated by torture; and, as a last resort, she was whipped at\r\nseveral different times, and kept a close prisoner. A heavy iron\r\ncollar, with three long prongs projecting from it, was placed round\r\nher neck, and a strong and sound front tooth was extracted, to serve\r\nas a mark to describe her, in case of escape. Her sufferings at this\r\ntime were agonizing; she could lie in no position but on her back,\r\nwhich was sore from scourgings, as I can testify, from personal\r\ninspection, and her only place of rest was the floor, on a blanket.\r\nThese outrages were committed in a family where the mistress daily\r\nread the scriptures, and assembled her children for family worship.\r\nShe was accounted, and was really, so far as almsgiving was concerned,\r\na charitable woman, and tender hearted to the poor; and yet this\r\nsuffering slave, who was the seamstress of the family, was continually\r\nin her presence, sitting in her chamber to sew, or engaged in her\r\nother household work, with her lacerated and bleeding back, her\r\nmutilated mouth, and heavy iron collar, without, so far as appeared,\r\nexciting any feelings of compassion.\r\n\r\nA highly intelligent slave, who panted after freedom with ceaseless\r\nlongings, made many attempts to get possession of himself. For every\r\noffence he was punished with extreme severity. At one time he was tied\r\nup by his hands to a tree, and whipped until his back was one gore of\r\nblood. To this terrible infliction he was subjected at intervals for\r\nseveral weeks, and kept heavily ironed while at his work. His master\r\none day accused him of a fault, in the usual terms dictated by passion\r\nand arbitrary power; the man protested his innocence, but was not\r\ncredited. He again repelled the charge with honest indignation. His\r\nmaster's temper rose almost to frenzy; and seizing a fork, he made a\r\ndeadly plunge at the breast of the slave. The man being far his\r\nsuperior in strength, caught the arm, and dashed the weapon on the\r\nfloor. His master grasped at his throat, but the slave disengaged\r\nhimself, and rushed from the apartment, having made his escape, he\r\nfled to the woods; and after wandering about for many months, living\r\non roots and berries, and enduring every hardship, he was arrested and\r\ncommitted to jail. Here he lay for a considerable time, allowed\r\nscarcely food enough to sustain life, whipped in the most shocking\r\nmanner, and confined in a cell so loathsome, that when his master\r\nvisited him, he said the stench was enough to knock a man down. The\r\nfilth had never been removed from the apartment since the poor\r\ncreature had been immured in it. Although a black man, such had been\r\nthe effect of starvation and suffering, that his master declared he\r\nhardly recognized him--his complexion was so yellow, and his hair,\r\nnaturally thick and black, had become red and scanty; an infallible\r\nsign of long continued living on bad and insufficient food. Stripes,\r\nimprisonment, and the gnawings of hunger, had broken his lofty spirit\r\nfor a season; and, to use his master's own exulting expression, he was\r\n\"as humble as a dog.\" After a time he made another attempt to escape,\r\nand was absent so long, that a reward was offered for him, _dead or\r\nalive_. He eluded every attempt to take him, and his master,\r\ndespairing of ever getting him again, offered to pardon him if he\r\nwould return home. It is always understood that such intelligence will\r\nreach the runaway; and accordingly, at the entreaties of his wife and\r\nmother, the fugitive once more consented to return to his bitter\r\nbondage. I believe this was the last effort to obtain his liberty. His\r\nheart became touched with the power of the gospel; and the spirit\r\nwhich no inflictions could subdue, bowed at the cross of Jesus, and\r\nwith the language on his lips--\"the cup that my father hath given me,\r\nshall I not drink it?\" submitted to the yoke of the oppressor, and\r\nwore his chains in unmurmuring patience till death released him. The\r\nmaster who perpetrated these wrongs upon his slave, was one of the\r\nmost influential and honored citizens of South Carolina, and to his\r\nequals was bland, and courteous, and benevolent even to a proverb.\r\n\r\nA slave who had been separated from his wife, because it best suited\r\nthe convenience of his owner, ran away. He was taken up on the\r\nplantation where his wife, to whom he was tenderly attached, then\r\nlived. His only object in running away was to return to her--no other\r\nfault was attributed to him. For this offence he was confined in the\r\nstocks _six weeks_, in a miserable hovel, not weather-tight. He\r\nreceived fifty lashes weekly during that time, was allowed food barely\r\nsufficient to sustain him, and when released from confinement, was not\r\npermitted to return to his wife. His master, although himself a\r\nhusband and a father, was unmoved by the touching appeals of the\r\nslave, who entreated that he might only remain with his wife,\r\npromising to discharge his duties faithfully; his master continued\r\ninexorable, and he was torn from his wife and family. The owner of\r\nthis slave was a professing Christian, in full membership with the\r\nchurch, and this circumstance occurred when he was confined to his\r\nchamber during his last illness.\r\n\r\nA punishment dreaded more by the slaves than whipping, unless it is\r\nunusually severe, is one which was invented by a female acquaintance\r\nof mine in Charleston--I heard her say so with much satisfaction. It\r\nis standing on one foot and holding the other in the hand. Afterwards\r\nit was improved upon, and a strap was contrived to fasten around the\r\nankle and pass around the neck; so that the least weight of the foot\r\nresting on the strap would choke the person. The pain occasioned by\r\nthis unnatural position was great; and when continued, as it sometimes\r\nwas, for an hour or more, produced intense agony. I heard this same\r\nwoman say, that she had the ears of her waiting maid _slit_ for some\r\npetty theft. This she told me in the presence of the girl, who was\r\nstanding in the room. She often had the helpless victims of her\r\ncruelty severely whipped, not scrupling herself to wield the\r\ninstrument of torture, and with her own hands inflict severe\r\nchastisement. Her husband was less inhuman than his wife, but he was\r\noften goaded on by her to acts of great severity. In his last illness\r\nI was sent for, and watched beside his death couch. The girl on whom\r\nhe had so often inflicted punishment, haunted his dying hours; and\r\nwhen at length the king of terrors approached, he shrieked in utter\r\nagony of spirit, \"Oh, the blackness of darkness, the black imps, I can\r\nsee them all around me--take them away!\" and amid such exclamations he\r\nexpired. These persons were of one of the first families in\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, in whose veracity I have entire confidence, told me\r\nthat about two years ago, a woman in Charleston with whom I was well\r\nacquainted, had starved a female slave to death. She was confined in a\r\nsolitary apartment, kept constantly tied, and condemned to the slow\r\nand horrible death of starvation. This woman was notoriously cruel. To\r\nthose who have read the narrative of James Williams I need only say,\r\nthat the character of young Larrimore's wife is an exact description\r\nof this female tyrant, whose countenance was ever dressed in smiles\r\nwhen in the presence of strangers, but whose heart was as the nether\r\nmillstone toward her slaves.\r\n\r\nAs I was traveling in the lower country in South Carolina, a number of\r\nyears since, my attention was suddenly arrested by an exclamation of\r\nhorror from the coachman, who called out, \"Look there, Miss Sarah,\r\ndon't you see?\"--I looked in the direction he pointed, and saw a human\r\nhead stuck up on a high pole. On inquiry, I found that a runaway\r\nslave, who was outlawed, had been shot there, his head severed from\r\nhis body, and put upon the public highway, as a terror to deter slaves\r\nfrom running away.\r\n\r\nOn a plantation in North Carolina, where I was visiting, I happened\r\none day, in my rambles, to step into a negro cabin; my compassion was\r\ninstantly called forth by the object which presented itself. A slave,\r\nwhose head was white with age, was lying in one corner of the hovel;\r\nhe had under his head a few filthy rags but the boards were his only\r\nbed, it was the depth of winter, and the wind whistled through every\r\npart of the dilapidated building--he opened his languid eyes when I\r\nspoke, and in reply to my question, \"What is the matter?\" He said, \"I\r\nam dying of a cancer in my side.\"--As he removed the rags which\r\ncovered the sore, I found that it extended half round the body, and\r\nwas shockingly neglected. I inquired if he had any nurse. \"No,\r\nmissey,\" was his answer, \"but de people (the slaves) very kind to me,\r\ndey often steal time to run and see me and fetch me some ting to eat;\r\nif dey did not, I might starve.\" The master and mistress of this man,\r\nwho had been worn out in their service, were remarkable for their\r\nintelligence, and their hospitality knew no bounds towards those who\r\nwere of their own grade in society: the master had for some time held\r\nthe highest military office in North Carolina, and not long previous\r\nto the time of which I speak, was the Governor of the State.\r\n\r\nOn a plantation in South Carolina, I witnessed a similar case of\r\nsuffering--an aged woman suffering under an incurable disease in the\r\nsame miserably neglected situation. The \"owner\" of this slave was\r\nproverbially kind to her negroes; so much so, that the planters in the\r\nneighborhood said she spoiled them, and set a bad example, which might\r\nproduce discontent among the surrounding slaves; yet I have seen this\r\nwoman tremble with rage, when her slaves displeased her, and heard her\r\nuse language to them which could only be expected from an inmate of\r\nBridewell; and have known her in a gust of passion send a favorite\r\nslave to the workhouse to be severely whipped.\r\n\r\nAnother fact occurs to me. A young woman about eighteen, stated some\r\ncircumstances relative to her young master, which were thought\r\nderogatory to his character; whether true or false, I am unable to\r\nsay; she was threatened with punishment, but persisted in affirming\r\nthat she had only spoken the truth. Finding her incorrigible, it was\r\nconcluded to send her to the Charleston workhouse and have her whipt;\r\nshe pleaded in vain for a commutation of her sentence, not so much\r\nbecause she dreaded the actual suffering, as because her delicate mind\r\nshrunk from the shocking exposure of her person to the eyes of brutal\r\nand licentious men; she declared to me that death would be preferable;\r\nbut her entreaties were vain, and as there was no means of escaping\r\nbut by running away, she resorted to it as a desperate remedy, for her\r\ntimid nature never could have braved the perils necessarily\r\nencountered by fugitive slaves, had not her mind been thrown into a\r\nstate of despair.--She was apprehended after a few weeks, by two\r\nslave-catchers, in a deserted house, and as it was late in the evening\r\nthey concluded to spend the night there. What inhuman treatment she\r\nreceived from them has never been revealed. They tied her with cords\r\nto their bodies, and supposing they had secured their victim, soon\r\nfell into a deep sleep, probably rendered more profound by\r\nintoxication and fatigue; but the miserable captive slumbered not; by\r\nsome means she disengaged herself from her bonds, and again fled\r\nthrough the lone wilderness. After a few days she was discovered in a\r\nwretched hut, which seemed to have been long uninhabited; she was\r\nspeechless; a raging fever consumed her vitals, and when a physician\r\nsaw her, he said she was dying of a disease brought on by over\r\nfatigue; her mother was permitted to visit her, but ere she reached\r\nher, the damps of death stood upon her brow, and she had only the sad\r\nconsolation of looking on the death-struck form and convulsive agonies\r\nof her child.\r\n\r\nA beloved friend in South Carolina, the wife of a slaveholder, with\r\nwhom I often mingled my tears, when helpless and hopeless we deplored\r\ntogether the horrors of slavery, related to me some years since the\r\nfollowing circumstance.\r\n\r\nOn the plantation adjoining her husband's, there was a slave of\r\npre-eminent piety. His master was not a professor of religion, but the\r\nsuperior excellence of this disciple of Christ was not unmarked by\r\nhim, and I believe he was so sensible of the good influence of his\r\npiety that he did not deprive him of the few religious privileges\r\nwithin his reach. A planter was one day dining with the owner of this\r\nslave, and in the course of conversation observed, that all profession\r\nof religion among slaves was mere hypocrisy. The other asserted a\r\ncontrary opinion, adding, I have a slave who I believe would rather\r\ndie than deny his Saviour. This was ridiculed, and the master urged to\r\nprove the assertion. He accordingly sent for this man of God, and\r\nperemptorily ordered him to deny his belief in the Lord Jesus Christ.\r\nThe slave pleaded to be excused, constantly affirming that he would\r\nrather die than deny the Redeemer, whose blood was shed for him. His\r\nmaster, after vainly trying to induce obedience by threats, had him\r\nterribly whipped. The fortitude of the sufferer was not to be shaken;\r\nhe nobly rejected the offer of exemption from further chastisement at\r\nthe expense of destroying his soul, and this blessed martyr _died in\r\nconsequence of this severe infliction_. Oh, how bright a gem will this\r\nvictim of irresponsible power be, in that crown which sparkles on the\r\nRedeemer's brow; and that many such will cluster there, I have not the\r\nshadow of a doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSARAH M. GRIMKÉ. _Fort Lee, Bergen County, New Jersey, 3rd Month,\r\n26th_, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THE LATE REV. JOHN GRAHAM of Townsend, Mass., who resided\r\nin S. Carolina, from 1831, to the latter part of 1833. Mr. Graham\r\ngraduated at Amherst College in 1829, spent some time at the\r\nTheological Seminary, in New Haven, Ct., and went to South Carolina,\r\nfor his health in 1830. He resided principally on the island of St.\r\nHelena, S.C., and most of the time in the family of James Tripp, Esq.,\r\na wealthy slave holding planter. During his residence at St. Helena,\r\nhe was engaged as an instructer, and was most of the time the stated\r\npreacher on the island. Mr. G. was extensively known in Massachusetts;\r\nand his fellow students and instructers, at Amherst College, and at\r\nYale Theological Seminary, can bear testimony to his integrity and\r\nmoral worth. The following are extracts of letters, which he wrote\r\nwhile in South Carolina, to an intimate friend in Concord,\r\nMassachusetts, who has kindly furnished them for publication.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS.\r\n\r\n_Springfield, St. Helena Isl., S.C., Oct. 22, 1832._\r\n\r\n\"Last night, about one o'clock, I was awakened by the report of a\r\nmusket. I was out of bed almost instantly. On opening my window, I\r\nfound the report proceeded from my host's chamber. He had let off his\r\npistol, which he usually keeps by him night and day, at a slave, who\r\nhad come into the yard, and as it appears, had been with one of his\r\nhouse servants. He did not hit him. The ball, taken from a pine tree\r\nthe next morning, I will show you, should I be spared by Providence\r\never to return to you. The house servant was called to the master's\r\nchamber, where he received 75 lashes, very severe too; and I could not\r\nonly hear every lash, but each groan which succeeded very distinctly\r\nas I lay in my bed. What was then done with the servant I know not.\r\nNothing was said of this to me in the morning and I presume it will\r\never be kept from me with care, if I may judge of kindred acts. I\r\nshall make no comment.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same letter, Mr. Graham says:--\r\n\r\n\"You ask me of my hostess\"--then after giving an idea of her character\r\nsays: \"To day, she has I verily believe laid, in a very severe manner\r\ntoo, more than 300 _stripes_, upon the house servants,\" (17 in\r\nnumber.)\r\n\r\n_Darlington, Court Moons. S.C. March, 28th, 1838._\r\n\r\n\"I walked up to the Court House to day, where I heard one of the most\r\ninteresting cases I ever heard. I say interesting, on account of its\r\nnovelty to me, though it had no novelty for the people, as such cases\r\nare of frequent occurrence. The case was this: To know whether two\r\nladies, present in court, were _white_ or _black_. The ladies were\r\ndressed well, seemed modest, and were retiring and neat in their look,\r\nhaving blue eyes, black hair, and appeared to understand much of the\r\netiquette of southern behaviour.\r\n\r\n\"A man, more avaricious than humane, as is the case with most of the\r\nrich planters, laid a remote claim to those two modest, unassuming,\r\ninnocent and free young ladies as his property, with the design of\r\nputting them into the field, and thus increasing his STOCK! As well as\r\nthe people of Concord are known to be of a peaceful disposition, and\r\nfor their love of good order, I verily believe if a similar trial\r\nshould be brought forward there and conducted as this was, the good\r\npeople would drive the lawyers out of the house. Such would be their\r\nindignation at their language, and at the mean under-handed manner of\r\ntrying to ruin those young ladies, as to their standing in society in\r\nthis district, if they could not succeed in dooming them for life to\r\nthe degraded condition of slavery, and all its intolerable cruelties.\r\nOh slavery! if statues of marble could curse you, they would speak. If\r\nbricks could speak, they would all surely thunder out their anathemas\r\nagainst you, accursed thing! How many white sons and daughters have\r\nbled and groaned under the lash in this sultry climate,\" &c.\r\n\r\nUnder date of March, 1832, Mr. G. writes, \"I have been doing what I\r\nhope never to be called to do again, and what I fear I have badly\r\ndone, though performed to the best of my ability, namely, sewing up a\r\nvery bad wound made by a wild hog. The slave was hunting wild hogs,\r\nwhen one, being closely pursued, turned upon his pursuer, who turning\r\nto run, was caught by the animal, thrown down, and badly wounded in\r\nthe thigh. The wound is about five inches long and very deep. It was\r\nmade by the tusk of the animal. The slaves brought him to one of the\r\nhuts on Mr. Tripp's plantation and made every exertion to stop the\r\nblood by filling the wound with ashes, (their remedy for stopping\r\nblood) but finding this to fail they came to me (there being no other\r\nwhite person on the plantation, as it is now holidays) to know if I\r\ncould stop the blood. I went and found that the poor creature must\r\nbleed to death unless it could be stopped soon. I called for a needle\r\nand succeeded in sewing it up as well as I could, and in stopping the\r\nblood. In a short time his master, who had been sent for came; and\r\noh, you would have shuddered if you had heard the awful oaths that\r\nfell from his lips, threatening in the same breath \"_to pay him for\r\nthat_!\" I left him as soon as decency would permit, with his hearty\r\nthanks that I had saved him $500! Oh, may heaven protect the poor,\r\nsuffering, fainting slave, and show his master his wanton cruelty--oh\r\nslavery! slavery!\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of July, 1832, Mr. G. writes, \"I wish you could have been\r\nat the breakfast table with me this morning to have seen and heard\r\nwhat I saw and heard, not that I wish your ear and heart and soul\r\npained as mine is, with every day's observation 'of wrong and outrage'\r\nwith which this place is filled, but that you might have auricular and\r\nocular evidence of the cruelty of slavery, of cruelties that mortal\r\nlanguage can never describe--that you might see the tender mercies of\r\na hardened slaveholder, one who bears the name of being _one of the\r\nmildest and most merciful masters of which this island can boast_. Oh,\r\nmy friend, another is screaming under the lash, in the shed-room, but\r\nfor what I know not. The scene this morning was truly distressing to\r\nme. It was this:--_After the blessing was asked_ at the breakfast\r\ntable, one of the servants, a woman grown, in giving one of the\r\nchildren some molasses, happened to pour out a little more than usual,\r\nthough not more than the child usually eats. Her master was angry at\r\nthe petty and indifferent mistake, or slip of the hand. He rose from\r\nthe table, took both of her hands in one of his, and with the other\r\nbegan to beat her, first on one side of her head and then on the\r\nother, and repeating this, till, as he said on sitting down at table,\r\nit hurt his hand too much to continue it longer. He then took off his\r\n_shoe_, and with the heel began in the same manner as with his hand,\r\ntill the poor creature could no longer endure it without screeches and\r\nraising her elbow as it is natural to ward off the blows. He then\r\ncalled a great overgrown negro _to hold her hands behind her_ while he\r\nshould wreak his vengeance upon the poor servant. In this position he\r\nbegan again to beat the poor suffering wretch. It now became\r\nintolerable to bear; she _fell, screaming to me for help_. After she\r\nfell, he beat her until I thought she would have died in his hands.\r\nShe got up, however, went out and washed off the blood and came in\r\nbefore we rose from table, one of the most pitiable objects I ever saw\r\ntill I came to the South. Her ears were almost as thick as my hand,\r\nher eyes awfully blood-shotten, her lips, nose, cheeks, chin, and\r\nwhole head swollen so that no one would have known it was Etta--and\r\nfor all this, she had to turn round as she was going out and _thank\r\nher master!_ Now, all this was done while I was sitting at breakfast\r\nwith the rest of the family. Think you not I wished myself sitting\r\nwith the peaceful and happy circle around your table? Think of my\r\nfeelings, but pity the poor negro slave, who not only fans his cruel\r\nmaster when he eats and sleeps, but bears the stripes his caprice may\r\ninflict. Think of this, and let heaven hear your prayers.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated St. Helena Island, S.C., Dec. 3, 1832, Mr. G.\r\nwrites, \"If a slave here complains to his master, that his task is too\r\ngreat, his master at once calls him a scoundrel and tells him it is\r\nonly because he has not enough to do, and orders the driver to\r\nincrease his task, however unable he may be for the performance of it.\r\nI saw TWENTY-SEVEN _whipped at one time_ just because they did not do\r\nmore, when the poor creatures were so tired that they could scarcely\r\ndrag one foot after the other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MR. WILLIAM POE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Poe is a native of Richmond, Virginia, and was formerly a\r\nslaveholder. He was for several years a merchant in Richmond, and\r\nsubsequently in Lynchburg, Virginia. A few years since, he emancipated\r\nhis slaves, and removed to Hamilton County, Ohio, near Cincinnati;\r\nwhere he is a highly respected ruling elder in the Presbyterian\r\nchurch. He says,--\r\n\r\n\"I am pained exceedingly, and nothing but my duty to God, to the\r\noppressors, and to the poor down-trodden slaves, who go mourning all\r\ntheir days, could move me to say a word. I will state to you a _few_\r\ncases of the abuse of the slaves, but time would fail, if I had\r\nlanguage to tell how many and great are the inflictions of slavery,\r\neven in its mildest form.\r\n\r\nBenjamin James Harris, a wealthy tobacconist of Richmond, Virginia,\r\nwhipped a slave girl fifteen years old to death. While he was whipping\r\nher, his wife heated a smoothing iron, put it on her body in various\r\nplaces, and burned her severely. The verdict of the coroner's inquest\r\nwas, \"Died of excessive whipping.\" He was tried in Richmond, and\r\nacquitted. I attended the trial. Some years after, this same Harris\r\nwhipped another slave to death. The man had not done so much work as\r\nwas required of him. After a number of protracted and violent\r\nscourgings, with short intervals between, the slave died under the\r\nlash. Harris was tried, and again acquitted, because none but blacks\r\nsaw it done. The same man afterwards whipped another slave severely,\r\nfor not doing work to please him. After repeated and severe floggings\r\nin quick succession, for the same cause, the slave, in despair of\r\npleasing him, cut off his own hand. Harris soon after became a\r\nbankrupt, went to New Orleans to recruit his finances, failed, removed\r\nto Kentucky, became a maniac, and died.\r\n\r\nA captain in the United States' Navy, who married a daughter of the\r\ncollector of the port of Richmond, and resided there, became offended\r\nwith his negro boy, took him into the meat house, put him upon a\r\nstool, crossed his hands before him, tied a rope to them, threw it\r\nover a joist in the building, drew the boy up so that he could just\r\nstand on the stool with his toes, and kept him in that position,\r\nflogging him severely at intervals, until the boy became so exhausted\r\nthat he reeled off the stool, and swung by his hands until he died.\r\nThe master was tried and acquitted.\r\n\r\nIn Goochland County, Virginia, an overseer tied a slave to a tree,\r\nflogged him again and again with great severity, then piled brush\r\naround him, set it on fire, and burned him to death. The overseer was\r\ntried and imprisoned. The whole transaction may be found on the\r\nrecords of the court.\r\n\r\nIn traveling, one day, from Petersburg to Richmond, Virginia, I heard\r\ncries of distress at a distance, on the road. I rode up, and found two\r\nwhite men, beating a slave. One of them had hold of a rope, which was\r\npassed under the bottom of a fence; the other end was fastened around\r\nthe neck of the slave, who was thrown flat on the ground, on his face,\r\nwith his back bared. The other was beating him furiously with a large\r\nhickory.\r\n\r\nA slaveholder in Henrico County, Virginia, had a slave who used\r\nfrequently to work for my father. One morning he came into the field\r\nwith his back completely _cut up_, and mangled from his head to his\r\nheels. The man was so stiff and sore he could scarcely walk. This same\r\nperson got offended with another of his slaves, knocked him down, and\r\nstruck out one of his eyes with a maul. The eyes of several of his\r\nslaves were injured by similar violence.\r\n\r\nIn Richmond, Virginia, a company occupied as a dwelling a large\r\nwarehouse. They got angry with a negro lad, one of their slaves, took\r\nhim into the cellar, tied his hands with a rope, bored a hole though\r\nthe floor, and passed the rope up through it. Some of the family drew\r\nup the boy, while others whipped. This they continued until the boy\r\ndied. The warehouse was owned by a Mr. Whitlock, on the scite of one\r\nformerly owned by a Mr. Philpot.\r\n\r\nJoseph Chilton, a resident of Campbell County, Virginia, purchased a\r\nquart of tanners' oil, for the purpose, as he said, of putting it on\r\none of his negro's heads, that he had sometime previous pitched or\r\ntarred over, for running away.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Lynchburg, Virginia, there was a negro man put in\r\nprison, charged with having pillaged some packages of goods, which he,\r\nas head man of a boat, received at Richmond, to be delivered at\r\nLynchburg. The goods belonged to A.B. Nichols, of Liberty, Bedford\r\nCounty, Virginia. He came to Lynchburg, and desired the jailor to\r\npermit him to whip the negro, to make him confess, as there was _no\r\nproof against him_. Mr. Williams, (I think that is his name,) a pious\r\nMethodist man, a great stickler for law and good order, professedly a\r\ngreat friend to the black man, delivered the negro into the hands of\r\nNichols. Nichols told me that he took the slave, tied his wrists\r\ntogether, then drew his arms down so far below his knees as to permit\r\na staff to pass above the arms under the knees, thereby placing the\r\nslave in a situation that he could not move hand or foot. He then\r\ncommenced his bloody work, and continued, at intervals, until 500\r\nblows were inflicted. I received this statement from Nichols himself,\r\nwho was, by the way, a _son of the land of \"steady habits_,\" where\r\nthere are many like him, if we may judge from their writings, sayings,\r\nand doings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVATIONS OF THE SLAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. FOOD.\r\n\r\nWe begin with the _food_ of the slaves, because if they are ill\r\ntreated in this respect we may be sure that they will be ill treated\r\nin other respects, and generally in a greater degree. For a man\r\nhabitually to stint his dependents in their food, is the extreme of\r\nmeanness and cruelty, and the greatest evidence he can give of utter\r\nindifference to their comfort. The father who stints his children or\r\ndomestics, or the master his apprentices, or the employer his\r\nlaborers, or the officer his soldiers, or the captain his crew, when\r\nable to furnish them with sufficient food, is every where looked upon\r\nas unfeeling and cruel. All mankind agree to call such a character\r\ninhuman. If any thing can move a hard heart, it is the appeal of\r\nhunger. The Arab robber whose whole life is a prowl for plunder, will\r\nfreely divide his camel's milk with the hungry stranger who halts at\r\nhis tent door, though he may have just waylaid him and stripped him of\r\nhis money. Even savages take pity on hunger. Who ever went famishing\r\nfrom an Indian's wigwam? As much as hunger craves, is the Indian's\r\nfree gift even to an enemy. The necessity for food is such a universal\r\nwant, so constant, manifest and imperative, that the heart is more\r\ntouched with pity by the plea of hunger, and more ready to supply that\r\nwant than any other. He who can habitually inflict on others the pain\r\nof hunger by giving them insufficient food, can habitually inflict on\r\nthem any other pain. He can kick and cuff and flog and brand them, put\r\nthem in irons or the stocks, can overwork them, deprive them of sleep,\r\nlacerate their backs, make them work without clothing, and sleep\r\nwithout covering.\r\n\r\nOther cruelties may be perpetrated in hot blood and the acts regretted\r\nas soon as done--the feeling that prompts them is not a permanent\r\nstate of mind, but a violent impulse stung up by sudden provocation.\r\nBut he who habitually withholds from his dependents sufficient\r\nsustenance, can plead no such palliation. The fact itself shows, that\r\nhis permanent state of mind toward them is a brutal indifference to\r\ntheir wants and sufferings--A state of mind which will naturally,\r\nnecessarily, show itself in innumerable privations and inflictions\r\nupon them, when it can be done with impunity.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we find upon examination, that the slaveholders do not\r\nfurnish their slaves with sufficient food, and do thus habitually\r\ninflict upon them the pain of hunger, we have a clue furnished to\r\ntheir treatment in other respects, and may fairly infer habitual and\r\nsevere privations and inflictions; not merely from the fact that men\r\nare quick to feel for those who suffer from hunger, and perhaps more\r\nready to relieve that want than any other; but also, because it is\r\nmore for the interest of the slaveholder to supply that want than any\r\nother; consequently, if the slave suffer in this respect, he must as\r\nthe general rule, suffer _more_ in other respects.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to show that the slaves have insufficient food. This\r\nwill be shown first from the express declarations of slaveholders, and\r\nother competent witnesses who are, or have been residents of slave\r\nstates, that the slaves generally are _under-fed._ And then, by the\r\nlaws of slave states, and by the testimony of slaveholders and others,\r\nthe _kind, quantity_, and _quality,_ of their allowance will be given,\r\nand the reader left to judge for himself whether the slave _must_ not\r\nbe a sufferer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVES SUFFER FROM HUNGER--DECLARATIONS OF SLAVE-HOLDERS AND\r\nOTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Alexander Smyth, a slave holder, and for ten years, Member of\r\nCongress from Virginia, in his speech on the Missouri question. Jan\r\n28th, 1820.\r\n\r\n\"By confining the slaves to the Southern states, where crops are\r\nraised for exportation, and bread and meat are purchased, you _doom\r\nthem to scarcity and hunger._ It is proposed to hem in the blacks\r\nwhere they are ILL FED.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. George Whitefield, in his letter, to the slave holders of Md. Va.\r\nN.C. S.C. and Ga. published in Georgia, just one hundred years ago,\r\n1739.\r\n\r\n\"My blood has frequently run cold within me, to think how many of your\r\nslaves _have not sufficient food to eat;_ they are scarcely permitted\r\nto _pick up the crumbs,_ that fall from their master's table.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. John Rankin, of Ripley, Ohio, a native of Tennessee, and for same\r\nyears a preacher in slave states.\r\n\r\n\"Thousands of the slaves are pressed with the gnawings of cruel hunger\r\nduring their whole lives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReport of the Gradual Emancipation Society, of North Carolina, 1826.\r\nSigned Moses Swain, President, and William Swain, Secretary.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the condition of slaves, in the eastern part of that\r\nstate, the report says,--\"The master puts the unfortunate wretches\r\nupon short allowances, scarcely sufficient for their sustenance, so\r\nthat a _great part_ of them go _half starved_ much of the time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Asa A. Stone, a Theological Student, who resided near Natchez,\r\nMiss., in 1834-5.\r\n\r\n\"On almost every plantation, the hands suffer more or less from hunger\r\nat some seasons of almost every year. There is always a _good deal of\r\nsuffering_ from hunger. On many plantations, and particularly in\r\nLouisiana, the slaves are in a condition of _almost utter famishment,_\r\nduring a great portion of the year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Clay, Esq., of Georgia, a Slaveholder.\r\n\r\n\"From various causes this [the slave's allowance of food] is _often_\r\nnot adequate to the support of a laboring man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Tobias Boudinot, St Albans, Ohio, a member of the Methodist\r\nChurch. Mr. B. for some years navigated the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves down the Mississippi, are _half-starved,_ the boats, when\r\nthey stop at night, are constantly boarded by slaves, begging for\r\nsomething to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Edwards, the younger, in a sermon before the Conn. Abolition\r\nSociety, 1791.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves are supplied with barely enough to keep them from\r\n_starving._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Horace Moulton, a Methodist Clergyman of Marlboro' Mass., who\r\nlived five years in Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"As a general thing on the plantations, the slaves suffer extremely\r\nfor the want of food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. George Bourne, late editor of the Protestant Vindicator, N.Y.,\r\nwho was seven years pastor of a church in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves are deprived of _needful_ sustenance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2. KINDS OF FOOD.\r\n\r\nHon. Robert Turnbull, a slaveholder of Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"The subsistence of the slaves consists, from March until August, of\r\ncorn ground into grits, or meal, made into what is called _hominy_, or\r\nbaked into corn bread. The other six months, they are fed upon the\r\nsweet potatoe. Meat, when given, is only by way of _indulgence or\r\nfavor._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Eleazar Powell, Chippewa, Beaver Co., Penn., who resided in\r\nMississippi, in 1836-7.\r\n\r\n\"The food of the slaves was generally corn bread, and _sometimes_ meat\r\nor molasses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReuben G. Macy, a member of the Society of Friends, Hudson, N.Y., who\r\nresided in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves had no food allowed them besides _corn,_ excepting at\r\nChristmas, when they had beef.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. William Leftwich, a native of Virginia, and recently of Madison\r\nCo., Alabama, now member, of the Presbyterian Church, Delhi, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"On my uncle's plantation, the food of the slaves, was corn-pone and a\r\nsmall allowance of meat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LADD, Esq., of Minot, Me., president of the American Peace\r\nSociety, and formerly a slaveholder of Florida, gives the following\r\ntestimony as to the allowance of food to slaves.\r\n\r\n\"The usual food of the slaves was _corn_, with a modicum of salt. In\r\nsome cases the master allowed no salt, but the slaves boiled the sea\r\nwater for salt in their little pots. For about eight days near\r\nChristmas, i.e., from the Saturday evening before, to the Sunday\r\nevening after Christmas day, they were allowed some _meat_. They\r\nalways with one single exception ground their corn in a hand-mill, and\r\ncooked their food themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract of a letter from Rev. D.C. EASTMAN, a preacher of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal church, in Fayette county, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"In March, 1838, Mr. Thomas Larrimer, a deacon of the Presbyterian\r\nchurch in Bloomingbury, Fayette county, Ohio, Mr. G.S. Fullerton,\r\nmerchant, and member of the same church, and Mr. William A. Ustick, an\r\nelder of the same church, spent a night with a Mr. Shepherd, about 30\r\nmiles North of Charleston, S.C., on the Monk's corner road. He owned\r\nfive families of negroes, who, he said, were fed from the same meal\r\nand meat tubs as himself, but that 90 out of a 100 of all the slaves\r\nin that county _saw meat but once a year_, which was on Christmas\r\nholidays.\"\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the inhuman experiments sometimes tried upon\r\nslaves, in respect to the _kind_ as well as the quality and quantity\r\nof their food, we solicit the attention of the reader to the testimony\r\nof the late General Wade Hampton, of South Carolina. General Hampton\r\nwas for some time commander in chief of the army on the Canada\r\nfrontier during the last war, and at the time of his death, about\r\nthree years since, was the largest slaveholder in the United States.\r\nThe General's testimony is contained in the following extract of a\r\nletter, just received from a distinguished clergyman in the west,\r\nextensively known both as a preacher and a writer. His name is with\r\nthe executive committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society.\r\n\r\n\"You refer in your letter to a statement made to you while in this\r\nplace, respecting the late General Wade Hampton, of South Carolina,\r\nand task me to write out for you the circumstances of the\r\ncase--considering them well calculated to illustrate two points in the\r\nhistory of slavery: 1st, That the habit of slaveholding dreadfully\r\nblunts the feelings toward the slave, producing such insensibility\r\nthat his sufferings and death are regarded with indifference. 2d, That\r\nthe slave often has insufficient food, both in quantity and quality.\r\n\r\n\"I received my information from a lady in the west of high\r\nrespectability and great moral worth,--but think it best to withhold\r\nher name, although the statement was not made in confidence.\r\n\r\n\"My informant stated that she sat at dinner once in company with\r\nGeneral Wade Hampton, and several others; that the conversation turned\r\nupon the treatment of their servants, &c.; when the General undertook\r\nto entertain the company with the relation of an experiment he had\r\nmade in the feeding of his slaves on cotton seed. He said that he\r\nfirst mingled one-fourth cotton seed with three-fourths corn, on which\r\nthey seemed to thrive tolerably well; that he then had measured out to\r\nthem equal quantities of each, which did not seem to produce any\r\nimportant change; afterwards he increased the quantity of cotton seed\r\nto three-fourths, mingled with one-fourth corn, and then he declared,\r\nwith an oath, that 'they died like rotten sheep!!' It is but justice\r\nto the lady to state that she spoke of his conduct with the utmost\r\nindignation; and she mentioned also that he received no countenance\r\nfrom the company present, but that all seemed to look at each other\r\nwith astonishment. I give it to you just as I received it from one who\r\nwas present, and whose character for veracity is unquestionable.\r\n\r\n\"It is proper to add that I had previously formed an acquaintance with\r\nDr. Witherspoon, now of Alabama, if alive; whose former residence was\r\nin South Carolina; from whom I received a particular account of the\r\nmanner of feeding and treating slaves on the plantations of General\r\nWade Hampton, and others in the same part of the State; and certainly\r\nno one could listen to the recital without concluding that such\r\nmasters and overseers as he described must have hearts like the nether\r\nmillstone. The cotton seed experiment I had heard of before also, as\r\nhaving been made in other parts of the south; consequently, I was\r\nprepared to receive as true the above statement, even if I had not\r\nbeen so well acquainted with the high character of my informant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2. QUANTITY OF FOOD\r\n\r\nThe legal allowance of food for slaves in North Carolina, is in the\r\nwords of the law, \"a quart of corn per day.\" See Haywood's Manual,\r\n525. The legal allowance in Louisiana is more, a barrel [flour barrel]\r\nof corn, (in the ear,) or its equivalent in other grain, and a pint of\r\nsalt a month. In the other slave states the amount of food for the\r\nslaves is left to the option of the master.\r\n\r\n\r\nThos. Clay, Esq., of Georgia, a slave holder, in his address before\r\nthe Georgia Presbytery, 1833.\r\n\r\n\"The quantity allowed by custom is _a peck of corn a week_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maryland Journal, and Baltimore Advertiser, May 30, 1788.\r\n\r\n\"_A single peck of corn a week, or the like measure of rice_, is the\r\n_ordinary_ quantity of provision for a _hard-working_ slave; to which\r\na small quantity of meat is occasionally, though _rarely_, added.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nW.C. Gildersleeve, Esq., a native of Georgia, and Elder in the\r\nPresbyterian Church, Wilksbarre, Penn.\r\n\r\n\"The weekly allowance to grown slaves on this plantation, where I was\r\nbest acquainted, was _one peck of corn_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWm. Ladd, of Minot, Maine, formerly a slaveholder in Florida.\r\n\r\n\"The usual allowance of food was _one quart of corn a day_, to a full\r\ntask hand, with a modicum of salt; kind masters allowed _a peck of\r\ncorn a week_; some masters allowed no salt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Jarvis Brewster, in his \"Exposition of the treatment of slaves in\r\nthe Southern States,\" published in N. Jersey, 1815.\r\n\r\n\"The allowance of provisions for the slaves, is _one peck of corn, in\r\nthe grain, per week_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Horace Moulton, a Methodist Clergyman of Marlboro, Mass., who\r\nlived five years in Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"In Georgia the planters give each slave only _one peck of their gourd\r\nseed corn per week_, with a small quantity of salt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. F.C. Macy, Nantucket, Mass., who resided in Georgia in 1820.\r\n\r\n\"The food of the slaves was three pecks of potatos a week during the\r\npotato season, and _one peck of corn_, during the remainder of the\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Nehemiah Caulkins, a member of the Baptist Church in Waterford,\r\nConn., who resided in North Carolina, eleven winters.\r\n\r\n\"The subsistence of the slaves, consists of _seven quarts of meal_ or\r\n_eight quarts of small rice for one week!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Savery, late of Philadelphia, an eminent Minister of the\r\nSociety of Friends, who travelled extensively in the slave states, on\r\na Religious Visitation, speaking of the subsistence of the slaves,\r\nsays, in his published Journal,\r\n\r\n\"_A peck of corn_ is their (the slaves,) miserable subsistence _for a\r\nweek_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late John Parrish, of Philadelphia, another highly respected\r\nMinister of the Society of Friends, who traversed the South, on a\r\nsimilar mission, in 1804 and 5, says in his \"Remarks on the slavery of\r\nBlacks;\"\r\n\r\n\"They allow them but _one peck of meal_, for a whole week, in some of\r\nthe Southern states.\"\r\n\r\nRichard Macy, Hudson, N.Y. a Member of the Society of Friends, who has\r\nresided in Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"Their usual allowance of food was one peck of corn per week, which\r\nwas dealt out to them every first day of the week. They had nothing\r\nallowed them besides the corn, except one quarter of beef at\r\nChristmas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. C.S. Renshaw, of Quincy, Ill., (the testimony of a Virginian).\r\n\r\n\"The slaves are generally allowanced: a pint of corn meal and a salt\r\nherring is the allowance, or in lieu of the herring a \"dab\" of fat\r\nmeat of about the same value. I have known the sour milk, and clauber\r\nto be served out to the hands, when there was an abundance of milk on\r\nthe plantation. This is a luxury not often afforded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTestimony of Mr. George W. Westgate, member of the Congregational\r\nChurch, of Quincy, Illinois. Mr. W. has been engaged in the low\r\ncountry trade for twelve years, more than half of each year,\r\nprincipally on the Mississippi, and its tributary streams in the\r\nsouth-western slave states.\r\n\r\n\"_Feeding is not sufficient_,--let facts speak. On the coast, i.e.\r\nNatchez and the Gulf of Mexico, the allowance was one barrel of ears\r\nof corn, and a pint of salt per month. They may cook this in what\r\nmanner they please, but it must be done after dark; they have no day\r\nlight to prepare it by. Some few planters, but only a few, let them\r\nprepare their corn on Saturday afternoon. Planters, overseers, and\r\nnegroes, have told me, that in _pinching times_, i.e. when corn is\r\nhigh, they did not get near that quantity. In Miss., I know some\r\nplanters who allowed their hands three and a half pounds of meat per\r\nweek, when it was cheap. Many prepare their corn on the Sabbath, when\r\nthey are not worked on that day, which however is frequently the case\r\non sugar plantations. There are very many masters on \"the coast\" who\r\nwill not suffer their slaves to come to the boats, because they steal\r\nmolasses to barter for meat; indeed they generally trade more or less\r\nwith stolen property. But it is impossible to find out what and when,\r\nas their articles of barter are of such trifling importance. They\r\nwould often come on board our boats to beg a bone, and would tell how\r\nbadly they were fed, that they were almost starved; many a time I have\r\nset up all night, to prevent them from stealing something to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. QUALITY OF FOOD.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the kind and quantity of food allowed to the\r\nslaves, it is important to know something of its _quality_, that we\r\nmay judge of the amount of sustenance which it contains. For, if their\r\nprovisions are of an inferior quality, or in a damaged state, their\r\npower to sustain labor must be greatly diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Clay, Esq. of Georgia, from an address to the Georgia\r\nPresbytery, 1834, speaking of the quality of the corn given to the\r\nslaves, says,\r\n\r\n\"There is _often a defect here_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Horace Moulton, a Methodist clergyman at Marlboro, Mass. and\r\nfive years a resident of Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"The food, or 'feed' of slaves is generally of the _poorest_ kind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Western Medical Reformer,\" in an article on the diseases peculiar\r\nto negroes, by a Kentucky physician, says of the diet of the slaves;\r\n\r\n\"They live on a coarse, _crude, unwholesome diet_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor A.G. Smith, of the New York Medical College; formerly a\r\nphysician in Louisville, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nI have myself known numerous instances of large families of _badly\r\nfed_ negroes swept off by a prevailing epidemic; and it is well known\r\nto many intelligent planters in the south, that the best method of\r\npreventing that horrible malady, _Chachexia Africana_, is to feed the\r\nnegroes with _nutritious_ food.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. NUMBER AND TIME OF MEALS EACH DAY.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether or not the slaves suffer for want of food, the\r\nnumber of hours intervening, and the labor performed between their\r\nmeals, and the number of meals each day, should be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilemon Bliss, Esq., a lawyer in Elyria, Ohio, and member of the\r\nPresbyterian church, who lived in Florida, in 1834, and 1835.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves go to the field in the morning; they carry with them corn\r\nmeal wet with water, and at _noon_ build a fire on the ground and bake\r\nit in the ashes. After the labors of the day are over, they take their\r\n_second_ meal of ash-cake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Edwards, the younger.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves eat _twice_ during the day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Eleazar Powell, Chippewa, Beaver county, Penn., who resided in\r\nMississippi in 1836 and 1837.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves received _two_ meals during the day. Those who have their\r\nfood cooked for them get their breakfast about eleven o'clock, and\r\ntheir other meal _after night_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Nehemiah Caulkins, Waterford, Conn., who spent eleven winters in\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"The _breakfast_ of the slaves was generally about _ten or eleven_\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Phineas Smith, Centreville, N.Y., who has lived at the south some\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves have usually _two_ meals a day, viz: at eleven o'clock\r\nand at night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. C.S. Renshaw, Quincy, Illinois--the testimony of a Virginian.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves have _two_ meals a day. They breakfast at from ten to\r\neleven, A.M., and eat their supper at from six to nine or ten at\r\nnight, as the season and crops may be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding testimony establishes the following points.\r\n\r\n1st. That the slaves are allowed, in general, _no meat_. This appears\r\nfrom the fact, that in the _only_ slave states which regulate the\r\nslaves' rations _by law_, (North Carolina and Louisiana,) the _legal\r\nration_ contains _no meat_. Besides, the late Hon. R.J. Turnbull, one\r\nof the largest planters in South Carolina, says expressly, \"meat, when\r\ngiven, is only by the way of indulgence or favor.\" It is shown also by\r\nthe direct testimony recorded above, of slaveholders and others, in\r\nall parts of the slaveholding south and west, that the general\r\nallowance on plantations is corn or meal and salt merely. To this\r\nthere are doubtless many exceptions, but they are _only_ exceptions;\r\nthe number of slaveholders who furnish meat for their _field-hands_,\r\nis small, in comparison with the number of those who do not. The\r\nhouse slaves, that is, the cooks, chambermaids, waiters, &c.,\r\ngenerally get some meat every day; the remainder bits and bones of\r\ntheir masters' tables. But that the great body of the slaves, those\r\nthat compose the field gangs, whose labor and exposure, and consequent\r\nexhaustion, are vastly greater than those of house slaves, toiling as\r\nthey do from day light till dark, in the fogs of the early morning,\r\nunder the scorchings of mid-day, and amid the damps of evening, are\r\n_in general_ provided with _no meat_, is abundantly established by the\r\npreceding testimony.\r\n\r\nNow we do not say that meat _is necessary_ to sustain men under hard\r\nand long continued labor, nor that it is _not_. This is not a treatise\r\non dietetics; but it is a notorious fact, that the medical faculty in\r\nthis country, with very few exceptions, do most strenuously insist\r\nthat it is necessary; and that working men in all parts of the country\r\ndo _believe_ that meat is indispensable to sustain them, even those\r\nwho work within doors, and only ten hours a day, every one knows.\r\nFurther, it is notorious, that the slaveholders themselves _believe_\r\nthe daily use of meat to be absolutely necessary to the comfort, not\r\nmerely of those who labor, but of those who are idle, as is proved by\r\nthe fact of meat being a part of the daily ration of food provided for\r\nconvicts in the prisons, in every one of the slave states, except in\r\nthose rare cases where meat is expressly prohibited, and the convict\r\nis, by _way of extra punishment_ confined to bread and water; he is\r\noccasionally, and for a little time only, confined to bread and water;\r\nthat is, to the _ordinary diet_ of slaves, with this difference in\r\nfavor of the convict, his bread is made for him, whereas the slave is\r\nforced to pound or grind his own corn and make his own bread, when\r\nexhausted with toil.\r\n\r\nThe preceding testimony shows also, that _vegetables_ form generally\r\nno part of the slaves' allowance. The _sole_ food of the majority is\r\n_corn_: at every meal--from day to day--from week to week--from month\r\nto month, _corn_. In South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, the sweet\r\npotato is, to a considerable extent, substituted for corn during a\r\npart of the year.\r\n\r\n2d. The preceding testimony proves conclusively, that the _quantity of\r\nfood_ generally allowed to a full-grown field-hand, is a peck of corn\r\na week, or a fraction over a quart and a gill of corn a day. The legal\r\nration of North Carolina is _less_--in Louisiana it is _more_. Of the\r\nslaveholders and other witnesses, who give the fore-going testimony,\r\nthe reader will perceive that no one testifies to a larger allowance\r\nof corn than a peck for a week; though a number testify, that within\r\nthe circle of their knowledge, _seven_ quarts was the usual allowance.\r\nFrequently a small quantity of meat is added; but this, as has already\r\nbeen shown, is not the general rule for _field-hands_. We may add,\r\nalso, that in the season of \"pumpkins,\" \"cimblins,\" \"cabbages,\"\r\n\"greens,\" &c., the slaves on small plantations are, to some extent,\r\nfurnished with those articles.\r\n\r\nNow, without entering upon the vexed question of how much food is\r\nnecessary to sustain the human system, under severe toil and exposure,\r\nand without giving the opinions of physiologists as to the\r\ninsufficiency or sufficiency of the slaves' allowance, we affirm that\r\nall civilized nations have, in all ages, and in the most emphatic\r\nmanner, declared, that _eight quarts of corn a week_, (the usual\r\nallowance of our slaves,) is utterly insufficient to sustain the human\r\nbody, under such toil and exposure as that to which the slaves are\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\nTo show this fully, it will be necessary to make some estimates, and\r\npresent some statistics. And first, the northern reader must bear in\r\nmind, that the corn furnished to the slaves at the south, is almost\r\ninvariably the _white gourd seed_ corn, and that a quart of this kind\r\nof corn weighs five or six ounces _less_ than a quart of \"flint corn,\"\r\nthe kind generally raised in the northern and eastern states;\r\nconsequently a peck of the corn generally given to the slaves, would\r\nbe only equivalent to a fraction more than six quarts and a pint of\r\nthe corn commonly raised in the New England States, New York, New\r\nJersey, &c. Now, what would be said of the northern capitalist, who\r\nshould allow his laborers but _six quarts and five gills of corn for a\r\nweek's provisions?_\r\n\r\nFurther, it appears in evidence, that the corn given to the slaves is\r\noften _defective_. This, the reader will recollect, is the voluntary\r\ntestimony of Thomas Clay, Esq., the Georgia planter, whose testimony\r\nis given above. When this is the case, the amount of actual nutriment\r\ncontained in a peck of the \"gourd seed,\" may not be more than in five,\r\nor four, or even three quarts of \"flint corn.\"\r\n\r\nAs a quart of southern corn weighs at least five ounces less than a\r\nquart of northern corn, it requires little arithmetic to perceive,\r\nthat the daily allowance of the slave fed upon that kind of corn,\r\nwould contain about one third of a pound less nutriment than though\r\nhis daily ration were the same quantity of northern corn, which would\r\namount, in a year, to more than a hundred and twenty pounds of human\r\nsustenance! which would furnish the slave with his full allowance of a\r\npeck of corn a week for two months! It is unnecessary to add, that\r\nthis difference in the weight of the two kinds of corn, is an item too\r\nimportant to be overlooked. As one quart of the southern corn weighs\r\none pound and eleven-sixteenths of a pound, it follows that it would\r\nbe about one pound and six-eighths of a pound. We now solicit the\r\nattention of the reader to the following unanimous testimony, of the\r\ncivilized world, to the utter insufficiency of this amount of food to\r\nsustain human beings under labor. This testimony is to be found in the\r\nlaws of all civilized nations, which regulate the rations of soldiers\r\nand sailors, disbursements made by governments for the support of\r\ncitizens in times of public calamity, the allowance to convicts in\r\nprisons, &c. We will begin with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe daily ration for each United States soldier, established by act of\r\nCongress, May 30, 1796. was the following: one pound of beef, one\r\npound of bread, half a gill of spirits; and at the rate of one quart\r\nof salt, two quarts of vinegar, two pounds of soap, and one pound of\r\ncandles to every hundred rations. To those soldiers \"who were on the\r\nfrontiers,\" (where the labor and exposure were greater,) the ration\r\nwas one pound two ounces of beef and one pound two ounces of bread.\r\nLaws U.S. vol. 3d, sec. 10, p. 431.\r\n\r\nAfter an experiment of two years, the preceding ration being found\r\n_insufficient_, it was increased, by act of Congress, July 16, 1798,\r\nand was as follows: beef one pound and a quarter, bread one pound two\r\nounces; salt two quarts, vinegar four quarts, soap four pounds, and\r\ncandles one and a half pounds to the hundred rations. The preceding\r\nallowance was afterwards still further increased.\r\n\r\nThe _present daily ration_ for the United States' soldiers, is, as we\r\nlearn from an advertisement of Captain Fulton, of the United States'\r\narmy, in a late number of the Richmond (Va.) Enquirer, as follows: one\r\nand a quarter pounds of beef, one and three-sixteenths pounds of\r\nbread; and at the rate of _eight quarts of beans, eight pounds of\r\nsugar_, four pounds of coffee, two quarts of salt, four pounds of\r\ncandles, and four pounds of soap, to every hundred rations.\r\n\r\nWe have before us the daily rations provided for the emigrating Ottawa\r\nIndians, two years since, and for the emigrating Cherokees last fall.\r\nThey were the same--one pound of fresh beef, one pound of flour, &c.\r\n\r\nThe daily ration for the United States' navy, is fourteen ounces of\r\nbread, half a pound of beef, six ounces of pork, three ounces of rice,\r\nthree ounces of peas, one ounce of cheese, one ounce of sugar, half an\r\nounce of tea, one-third of a gill molasses.\r\n\r\nThe daily ration in the British army is one and a quarter pounds of\r\nbeef, one pound of bread, &c.\r\n\r\nThe daily ration in the French army is one pound of beef, one and a\r\nhalf pounds of bread, one pint of wine, &c.\r\n\r\nThe common daily ration for foot soldiers on the continent, is one\r\npound of meat, and one and a half pounds of bread.\r\n\r\nThe _sea ration_ among the Portuguese, has become the usual ration in\r\nthe navies of European powers generally. It is as follows: \"one and a\r\nhalf pounds of biscuit, one pound of salt meat, one pint of wine, with\r\nsome dried fish and onions.\"\r\n\r\nPRISON RATIONS.--Before giving the usual daily rations of food allowed\r\nto convicts, in the principal prisons in the United States, we will\r\nquote the testimony of the \"American Prison Discipline Society,\" which\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The common allowance of food in the penitentiaries, is equivalent to\r\nONE POUND OF MEAT, ONE POUND OF BREAD, AND ONE POUND OF VEGETABLES PER\r\nDAY. It varies a little from this in some of them, but it is generally\r\nequivalent to it.\" First Report of American Prison Discipline Society,\r\npage 13.\r\n\r\nThe daily ration of food to each convict, in the principal prisons in\r\nthis country, is as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the New Hampshire State Prison, one and a quarter pounds of meal,\r\nand fourteen ounces of beef, for _breakfast and dinner;_ and for\r\nsupper, a soup or porridge of potatos and beans, or peas, the\r\n_quantity not limited_.\r\n\r\nIn the Vermont prison, the convicts are allowed to eat _as much as\r\nthey wish_.\r\n\r\nIn the Massachusetts' penitentiary, one and a half pounds of bread,\r\nfourteen ounces of meat, half a pint of potatos, and one gill of\r\nmolasses, or one pint of milk.\r\n\r\nIn the Connecticut State Prison, one pound of beef, one pound of\r\nbread, two and a half pounds of potatos, half a gill of molasses, with\r\nsalt, pepper, and vinegar.\r\n\r\nIn the New York State Prison, at Auburn, one pound of beef, twenty-two\r\nounces of flour and meal, half a gill of molasses; with two quarts of\r\nrye, four quarts of salt, two quarts of vinegar, one and a half ounces\r\nof pepper, and two and a half bushels of potatos to every hundred\r\nrations.\r\n\r\nIn the New York State Prison at Sing Sing, one pound of beef, eighteen\r\nounces of flour and meal, besides potatos, rye coffee, and molasses.\r\n\r\nIn the New York City Prison, one pound of beef, one pound of flour;\r\nand three pecks of potatos to every hundred rations, with other small\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nIn the New Jersey State Prison, one pound of bread, half a pound of\r\nbeef, with potatos and cabbage, (quantity not specified,) one gill of\r\nmolasses, and a bowl of mush for supper.\r\n\r\nIn the late Walnut Street Prison, Philadelphia, one and a half pounds\r\nof bread and meal, half a pound of beef, one pint of potatos, one gill\r\nof molasses, and half a gill of rye, for coffee.\r\n\r\nIn the Baltimore prison, we believe the ration is the same with the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\nIn the Pennsylvania Eastern Penitentiary, one pound of bread and one\r\npint of coffee for breakfast, one pint of meat soup, with potatos\r\nwithout limit, for dinner, and mush and molasses for supper.\r\n\r\nIn the Penitentiary for the District of Columbia, Washington city, one\r\npound of beef, twelve ounces of Indian meal, ten ounces of wheat\r\nflour, half a gill of molasses; with two quarts of rye, four quarts of\r\nsalt, four quarts of vinegar, and two and a half bushels of potatos to\r\nevery hundred rations.\r\n\r\nRATIONS IN ENGLISH PRISONS.--The daily ration of food in the\r\nBedfordshire Penitentiary, is _two pounds of bread;_ and if at hard\r\nlabor, _a quart of soup for dinner._\r\n\r\nIn the Cambridge County House of Correction, three pounds of bread,\r\nand one pint of beer.\r\n\r\nIn the Millbank General Penitentiary, one and a half pounds of bread,\r\none pound of potatos, six ounces of beef, with half a pint of broth\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nIn the Gloucestershire Penitentiary, one and a half pounds of bread,\r\nthree-fourths of a pint of peas, made into soup, with beef, quantity\r\nnot stated. Also gruel, made of vegetables, quantity not stated, and\r\none and a half ounces of oatmeal mixed with it.\r\n\r\nIn the Leicestershire House of Correction, two pounds of bread, and\r\nthree pints of gruel; and when at hard labor, one pint of milk in\r\naddition, and twice a week a pint of meat soup at dinner, instead of\r\ngruel.\r\n\r\nIn the Buxton House of Correction, one and a half pounds of bread, one\r\nand a half pints of gruel, one and a half pints of soup, four-fifths\r\nof a pound of potatos, and two-sevenths of an ounce of beef.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the preceding daily ration in the Buxton Prison is\r\nabout double the usual daily allowance of our slaves, yet the visiting\r\nphysicians decided, that for those prisoners who were required to work\r\nthe tread-mill, it was _entirely sufficient_. This question was\r\nconsidered at length, and publicly discussed at the sessions of the\r\nSurry magistrates, with the benefit of medical advice; which resulted\r\nin \"large additions\" to the rations of those who worked on the\r\ntread-mill. See London Morning Chronicle, Jan. 13, 1830.\r\n\r\nTo the preceding we add the _ration of the Roman slaves_. The monthly\r\nallowance of food to slaves in Rome was called \"Dimensum.\" The\r\n\"Dimensum\" was an allowance of wheat or of other grain, which\r\nconsisted of five _modii_ a month to each slave. Ainsworth, in his\r\nLatin Dictionary estimates the _modius_, when used for the measurement\r\nof grain, at _a peck and a half_ our measure, which would make the\r\nRoman slave's allowance _two quarts of grain a day_, just double the\r\nallowance provided for the slave by _law_ in North Carolina, and _six_\r\nquarts more per week than the ordinary allowance of slaves in the\r\nslave states generally, as already established by the testimony of\r\nslaveholders themselves. But it must by no means be overlooked that\r\nthis \"dimensum,\" or _monthly_ allowance, was far from being the sole\r\nallowance of food to Roman slaves. In _addition_ to this, they had a\r\nstated _daily_ allowance (_diarium_) besides a monthly allowance of\r\n_money_, amounting to about a cent a day.\r\n\r\nNow without further trenching on the reader's time, we add, compare\r\nthe preceding daily allowances of food to soldiers and sailors in this\r\nand other countries; to convicts in this and other countries; to\r\nbodies of emigrants rationed at public expense; and finally, with the\r\nfixed allowance given to Roman slaves, and we find the states of this\r\nUnion, the _slave_ states as well as the free, the United States'\r\ngovernment, the different European governments, the old Roman empire,\r\nin fine, we may add, the _world_, ancient and modern, uniting in the\r\ntestimony that to furnish men at hard labor from daylight till dark\r\nwith but 1-1/2 lbs. of _corn_ per day, their sole sustenance, is to\r\nMURDER THEM BY PIECE-MEAL. The reader will perceive by examining the\r\npreceding statistics that the _average daily_ ration throughout this\r\ncountry and Europe exceeds the usual slave's allowance _at least a\r\npound a day_; also that one-third of this ration for soldiers and\r\nconvicts in the United States, and for solders and sailors in Europe\r\nis _meat_, generally beef; whereas the allowance of the mass of our\r\nslaves is corn, only. Further, the convicts in our prisons are\r\nsheltered from the heat of the sun, and from the damps of the early\r\nmorning and evening, from cold, rain, &c.; whereas, the great body of\r\nthe slaves are exposed to all of these, in their season, from daylight\r\ntill dark; besides this, they labor more hours in the day than\r\nconvicts, as will be shown under another head, and are obliged to\r\nprepare and cook their own food after they have finished the labor of\r\nthe day, while the convicts have theirs prepared for them. These, with\r\nother circumstances, necessarily make larger and longer draughts upon\r\nthe strength of the slave, produce consequently greater exhaustion,\r\nand demand a larger amount of food to restore and sustain the laborer\r\nthan is required by the convict in his briefer, less exposed, and less\r\nexhausting toils.\r\n\r\nThat the slaveholders themselves regard the usual allowance of food to\r\nslaves as insufficient, both in kind and quantity, for hard-working\r\nmen, is shown by the fact, that in all the slave states, we believe\r\nwithout exception, _white_ convicts at hard labor, have a much\r\n_larger_ allowance of food than the usual one of slaves; and generally\r\nmore than _one third_ of this daily allowance is meat. This conviction\r\nof slaveholders shows itself in various forms. When persons wish to\r\nhire slaves to labor on public works, in addition to the inducement of\r\nhigh wages held out to masters to hire out their slaves, the\r\ncontractors pledge themselves that a certain amount of food shall be\r\ngiven the slaves, taking care to specify a _larger_ amount than the\r\nusual allowance, and a part of it _meat_.\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement is an illustration. We copy it from the\r\n\"Daily Georgian,\" Savannah, Dec. 14, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGROES WANTED.\r\n\r\nThe Contractors upon the Brunswick and Alatamaha Canal are desirous to\r\nhire a number of prime Negro Men, from the 1st October next, for\r\nfifteen months, until the 1st January, 1810. They will pay at the rate\r\nof eighteen dollars per month for each prime hand.\r\n\r\nThese negroes will be employed in the excavation of the Canal. They\r\nwill be provided with _three and a half pounds of pork or bacon, and\r\nten quarts of gourd seed corn per week_, lodged in comfortable\r\nshantees and attended constantly a skilful physician. J.H. COUPER,\r\nP.M. NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we have direct testimony to this point. The late Hon. John Taylor,\r\nof Caroline Co. Virginia, for a long time Senator in Congress, and for\r\nmany years president of the Agricultural Society of the State, says in\r\nhis \"Agricultural Essays,\" No. 30, page 97, \"BREAD ALONE OUGHT NEVER\r\nTO BE CONSIDERED A SUFFICIENT DIET FOR SLAVES EXCEPT AS A PUNISHMENT.\"\r\nHe urges upon the planters of Virginia to give their slaves, in\r\naddition to bread, \"salt meat and vegetables,\" and adds, \"we shall be\r\nASTONISHED to discover upon trial, that this great comfort to them is\r\na profit to the master.\"\r\n\r\nThe Managers of the American Prison Discipline Society, in their third\r\nReport, page 58, say, \"In the Penitentiaries generally, in the United\r\nStates, the animal food is equal to one pound of meat per day for each\r\nconvict.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the actual suffering from hunger on the part of the slaves, is\r\nin the sugar and cotton-growing region, where the crops are exported\r\nand the corn generally purchased from the upper country. Where this is\r\nthe case there cannot but be suffering. The contingencies of bad\r\ncrops, difficult transportation, high prices, &c. &c., naturally\r\noccasion short and often precarious allowances. The following extract\r\nfrom a New Orleans paper of April 26, 1837, affords an illustration.\r\nThe writer in describing the effects of the money pressure in\r\nMississippi, says:\r\n\r\n\"They, (the planters,) are now left without provisions and the means\r\nof living and using their industry, for the present year. In this\r\ndilemma, planters whose crops have been from 100 to 700 bales, find\r\nthemselves forced to sacrifice many of their slaves in order to get\r\nthe common necessaries of life for the support of themselves and the\r\nrest of their negroes. In many places, heavy planters compel their\r\nslaves to fish for the means of subsistence, rather than sell them at\r\nsuch ruinous rates. There are at this moment THOUSANDS OF SLAVES in\r\nMississippi, that KNOW NOT WHERE THE NEXT MORSEL IS TO COME FROM. The\r\nmaster must be ruined to save the wretches from being STARVED.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LABOR\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVES ARE OVERWORKED.\r\n\r\nThis is abundantly proved by the number of hours that the slaves are\r\nobliged to be in the field. But before furnishing testimony as to\r\ntheir hours of labor and rest, we will present the express\r\ndeclarations of slaveholders and others, that the slaves are severely\r\ndriven in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House of Representatives of the State of South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n\"Many owners of slaves, and others who have the management of slaves,\r\n_do confine them so closely at hard labor that they have not\r\nsufficient time for natural rest_.--See 2 Brevard's Digest of the Laws\r\nof South Carolina, 243.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of Carolina.--Vol. I, page 190.\r\n\r\n\"So _laborious_ is the task of raising, beating, and cleaning rice,\r\nthat had it been possible to obtain European servants in sufficient\r\nnumbers, _thousands and tens of thousands_ MUST HAVE PERISHED.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Alexander Smyth, a slaveholder, and member of Congress from\r\nVirginia, in his speech on the \"Missouri question,\" Jan. 28, 1820.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not obvious that the way to render their situation _more\r\ncomfortable_, is to allow them to be taken where there is not the same\r\nmotive to force the slave to INCESSANT TOIL that there is in the\r\ncountry where cotton, sugar, and tobacco are raised for exportation.\r\nIt is proposed to hem in the blacks _where they are_ HARD WORKED,\r\nthat they may be rendered unproductive and the race be prevented from\r\nincreasing. * * * The proposed measure would be EXTREME CRUELTY to the\r\nblacks. * * * You would * * * doom them to HARD LABOR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Travels in Louisiana,\" translated from the French by John Davies,\r\nEsq.--Page 81.\r\n\r\n\"At the rolling of sugars, an interval of from two to three months,\r\nthey _work both night and day_.

Sometimes they were\r\nmade to work till nine o'clock at night, in such work as they could\r\ndo, as burning cotton stalks, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA New Orleans paper, dated March 23, 1826, says: \"To judge from the\r\nactivity reigning in the cotton presses of the suburbs of St. Mary,\r\nand the _late hours_ during which their slaves work, the cotton trade\r\nwas never more brisk.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE W. WESTGATE, a member of the Congregational Church at\r\nQuincy, Illinois, who lived in the south western slaves states a\r\nnumber of years says, \"the slaves are driven to the field in the\r\nmorning _about four o'clock_, the general calculation is to get them\r\nat work by daylight; the time for breakfast is between nine and ten\r\no'clock, this meal is sometimes eaten '_bite and work_,' others allow\r\nfifteen minutes, and this is the only rest the slave has while in the\r\nfield. I have never known a case of stopping for an hour, in\r\nLouisiana; in Mississippi the rule is milder, though entirely subject\r\nto the will of the master. On cotton plantations, in cotton picking\r\ntime, that is from October to Christmas, each hand has a certain\r\nquantity to pick, and is flogged if his task is not accomplished;\r\ntheir tasks are such as to keep them all the while busy.\"\r\n\r\nThe preceding testimony under this head has sole reference to the\r\nactual labor of the slaves _in the field_. In order to determine how\r\nmany hours are left for sleep, we must take into the account, the time\r\nspent in going to and from the field, which is often at a distance of\r\none, two and sometimes three miles; also the time necessary for\r\npounding, or grinding their corn, and preparing, overnight, their food\r\nfor the next day; also the preparation of tools, getting fuel and\r\npreparing it, making fires and cooking their suppers, if they have\r\nany, the occasional mending and washing of their clothes, &c. Besides\r\nthis, as everyone knows who has lived on a southern plantation, many\r\nlittle errands and _chores_ are to be done for their masters and\r\nmistresses, old and young, which have accumulated during the day and\r\nbeen kept in reserve till the slaves return from the field at night.\r\nTo this we may add that the slaves are _social_ beings, and that\r\nduring the day, silence is generally enforced by the whip of the\r\noverseer or driver.[3] When they return at night, their pent up social\r\nfeelings will seek vent, it is a law of nature, and though the body\r\nmay be greatly worn with toil, this law cannot be wholly stifled.\r\nSharers of the same woes, they are drawn together by strong\r\naffinities, and seek the society and sympathy of their fellows; even\r\n\"_tired_ nature\" will joyfully forego for a time needful rest, to\r\nminister to a want of its being equally permanent and imperative as\r\nthe want of sleep, and as much more profound, as the yearnings of the\r\nhigher nature surpass the instincts of its animal appendage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: We do not mean that they are not suffered to _speak_, but,\r\nthat, as conversation would be a hindrance to labour, they are\r\ngenerally permitted to indulge in it but little.]\r\n\r\nAll these things make drafts upon _time_. To show how much of the\r\nslave's time, which is absolutely indispensable for rest and sleep, is\r\nnecessarily spent in various labors after his return from the field at\r\nnight, we subjoin a few testimonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. CORNELIUS JOHNSON, Farmington, Ohio, who lived in Mississippi in\r\nthe years 1837 and 38, says:\r\n\r\n\"On all the plantations where I was acquainted, the slaves were kept\r\nin the field till dark; after which, those who had to grind their own\r\ncorn, had that to attend to, get their supper, attend to other family\r\naffairs of their own and of their master, such as bringing water,\r\nwashing, clothes, &c. &c., and be in the field as soon as it was\r\nsufficiently light to commence work in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE W. WESTGATE, of Quincy, Illinois, who has spent several\r\nyears in the south western slave states, says:\r\n\r\n\"Their time, after full dark until four o'clock in the morning is\r\ntheir own; this fact alone would seem to say they have sufficient\r\nrest, but there are other things to be considered; much of their\r\nmaking, mending and washing of clothes, preparing and cooking food,\r\nhauling and chopping wood, fixing and preparing tools, and a variety\r\nof little nameless jobs must be done between those hours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILEMON BLISS, Esq. of Elyria, Ohio, who resided in Florida in 1834\r\nand 5, gives the following testimony:\r\n\r\n\"After having finished their field labors, they are occupied till nine\r\nor ten o'clock in doing _chores_, such as grinding corn, (as all the\r\ncorn in the vicinity is ground by hand,) chopping wood, taking care of\r\nhorses, mules, &c., and a thousand things necessary to be done on a\r\nlarge plantation. If any extra job is to be done, it must not hinder\r\nthe 'niggers' from their work, but must be done in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nW.C. GILDERSLEEVE, Esq., a native of Georgia, an elder of the\r\nPresbyterian Church at Wilkes-barre, Pa. says:\r\n\r\n\"The corn is ground in a handmill by the slave _after his task is\r\ndone_--generally there is but one mill on the plantation, and as but\r\none can grind at a time, the mill is going sometimes _very late at\r\nnight_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now present another class of facts and testimony, showing that the\r\nslaves engaged in raising the large staples, are _overworked_.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1831, the writer of this had an interview with JAMES G.\r\nBIRNEY, Esq., who then resided in Kentucky, having removed with his\r\nfamily from Alabama the year before. A few hours before that\r\ninterview, and on the morning of the same day, Mr. B. had spent a\r\ncouple of hours with Hon. Henry Clay, at his residence, near\r\nLexington. Mr. Birney remarked, that Mr. Clay had just told him, he\r\nhad lately been led to mistrust certain estimates as to the increase\r\nof the slave population in the far south west--estimates which he had\r\npresented, I think, in a speech before the Colonization Society. He\r\nnow believed, that the births among the slaves in that quarter were\r\n_not equal to the deaths_--and that, of course, the slave population,\r\nindependent of immigration from the slave-selling states, was _not\r\nsustaining itself_.\r\n\r\nAmong other facts stated by Mr. Clay, was the following, which we copy\r\n_verbatim_ from the original memorandum, made at the time by Mr.\r\nBirney, with which he has kindly furnished us.\r\n\r\n\"Sept. 16, 1834.--Hon. H. Clay, in a conversation at his own house, on\r\nthe subject of slavery, informed me, that Hon. Outerbridge Horsey,\r\nformerly a senator in Congress from the state of Delaware, and the\r\nowner of a sugar plantation in Louisiana, declared to him, that his\r\noverseer worked his hands so closely, that one of the women brought\r\nforth a child whilst engaged in the labors of the field.\r\n\r\n\"Also, that a few years since, he was at a brick yard in the environs\r\nof New Orleans, in which one hundred hands were employed; among them\r\nwere from _twenty to thirty young women_, in the prime of life. He was\r\ntold by the proprietor, that there had _not been a child born among\r\nthem for the last two or three years, although they all had\r\nhusbands_.\"\r\n\r\nThe preceding testimony of Mr. Clay, is strongly corroborated by\r\nadvertisements of slaves, by Courts of Probate, and by executors\r\nadministering upon the estates of deceased persons. Some of those\r\nadvertisements for the sale of slaves, contain the names, ages,\r\naccustomed employment, &c., of all the slaves upon the plantation of\r\nthe deceased. These catalogues show large numbers of young men and\r\nwomen, almost all of them between twenty and thirty-eight years old;\r\nand yet the number of young children is _astonishingly small_. We have\r\nlaid aside many lists of this kind, in looking over the newspapers of\r\nthe slaveholding states; but the two following are all we can lay our\r\nhands on at present. One is in the \"Planter's Intelligencer,\"\r\nAlexandria, La., March 22, 1837, containing one hundred and thirty\r\nslaves; and the other in the New Orleans Bee, a few days later, April\r\n8, 1837, containing fifty-one slaves. The former is a \"Probate sale\"\r\nof the slaves belonging to the estate of Mr. Charles S. Lee, deceased,\r\nand is advertised by G.W. Keeton, Judge of the Parish of Concordia,\r\nLa. The sex, name, and age of each slave are contained in the\r\nadvertisement which fills two columns. The following are some of the\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of slaves is _one hundred and thirty_. Of these,\r\n_only three are over forty years old_. There are _thirty-five females_\r\nbetween the ages of _sixteen and thirty-three_, and yet there are only\r\nTHIRTEEN children under the age of _thirteen years!_\r\n\r\nIt is impossible satisfactorily to account for such a fact, on any\r\nother supposition, than that these thirty-five females were so\r\noverworked, or underfed, or both, as to prevent child-bearing.\r\n\r\nThe other advertisement is that of a \"Probate sale,\" ordered by the\r\nCourt of the Parish of Jefferson--including the slaves of Mr. William\r\nGormley. The whole number of slaves is fifty-one; the sex, age, and\r\naccustomed labors of each are given. The oldest of these slaves is but\r\n_thirty-nine years old_: of the females, _thirteen_ are between the\r\nages of sixteen and thirty-two, and the oldest female is but\r\n_thirty-eight_--and yet there are but _two children under eight years\r\nold!_\r\n\r\nAnother proof that the slaves in the south-western states are\r\nover-worked, is the fact, that so few of them live to old age. A large\r\nmajority of them are _old_ at middle age, and few live beyond\r\nfifty-five. In one of the preceding advertisements, out of one hundred\r\nand thirty slaves, only _three_ are over forty years old!  In the\r\nother, out of fifty-one slaves, only _two_ are over _thirty-five_; the\r\noldest is but thirty-nine, and the way in which he is designated in\r\nthe advertisement, is an additional proof, that what to others is\r\n\"middle age,\" is to the slaves in the south-west \"old age:\" he is\r\nadvertised as \"_old_ Jeffrey.\"\r\n\r\nBut the proof that the slave population of the south-west is so\r\nover-worked that it cannot _supply its own waste_, does not rest upon\r\nmere inferential evidence. The Agricultural Society of Baton Rouge,\r\nLa., in its report, published in 1829, furnishes a labored estimate of\r\nthe amount of expenditure necessarily incurred in conducting \"a\r\nwell-regulated sugar estate.\"  In this estimate, the annual net loss\r\nof slaves, over and above the supply by propagation, is set down at\r\nTWO AND A HALF PER CENT!  The late Hon. Josiah S. Johnson, a member of\r\nCongress from Louisiana, addressed a letter to the Secretary of the\r\nUnited States' Treasury, in 1830, containing a similar estimate,\r\napparently made with great care, and going into minute details. Many\r\nitems in this estimate differ from the preceding; but the estimate of\r\nthe annual _decrease_ of the slaves on a plantation was the same--TWO\r\nAND A HALF PER CENT!\r\n\r\nThe following testimony of Rev. Dr. Channing, of Boston, who resided\r\nsome time in Virginia, shows that the over-working of slaves, to such\r\nan extent as to abridge life, and cause a decrease of population, is\r\nnot confined to the far south and south-west.\r\n\r\n\"I heard of an estate managed by an individual who was considered as\r\nsingularly successful, and who was able to govern the slaves without\r\nthe use of the whip. I was anxious to see him, and trusted that some\r\ndiscovery had been made favorable to humanity. I asked him how he was\r\nable to dispense with corporal punishment. He replied to me, with a\r\nvery determined look, 'The slaves know that the work _must_ be done,\r\nand that it is better to do it without punishment than with it.'  In\r\nother words, the certainty and dread of chastisement were so impressed\r\non them, that they never incurred it.\r\n\r\n\"I then found that the slaves on this well-managed estate, _decreased_\r\nin number. I asked the cause. He replied, with perfect frankness and\r\nease, 'The gang is not large enough for the estate.'  In other words,\r\nthey were not equal to the work of the plantation, and, yet were _made\r\nto do it_, though with the certainty of abridging life.\r\n\r\n\"On this plantation the huts were uncommonly convenient. There was an\r\nunusual air of neatness. A superficial observer would have called the\r\nslaves happy. Yet they were living under a severe, subduing\r\ndiscipline, and were _over-worked_ to a degree that _shortened\r\nlife_.\"--_Channing on Slavery_, page 162, first edition.\r\n\r\nPHILEMON BLISS, Esq., a lawyer of Elyria, Ohio, who spent some time in\r\nFlorida, gives the following testimony to the over-working of the\r\nslaves:\r\n\r\n\"It is not uncommon for hands, in hurrying times, beside working all\r\nday, to labor half the night. This is usually the case on sugar\r\nplantations, during the sugar-boiling season; and on cotton, during\r\nits gathering. Beside the regular task of picking cotton, averaging of\r\nthe short staple, when the crop is good, 100 pounds a day to the hand,\r\nthe ginning (extracting the seed,) and baling was done in the night.\r\nSaid Mr. ---- to me, while conversing upon the customary labor of\r\nslaves, 'I work my niggers in a hurrying time till 11 or 12 o'clock at\r\nnight, and have them up by four in the morning.'\r\n\r\n\"Beside the common inducement, the desire of gain, to make a large\r\ncrop, the desire is increased by that spirit of gambling, so common at\r\nthe south. It is very common to _bet_ on the issue of a crop. A.\r\nlays a wager that, from a given number of hands, he will make more\r\ncotton than B. The wager is accepted, and then begins the contest; and\r\nwho bears the burden of it?  How many tears, yea, how many broken\r\nconstitutions, and premature deaths, have been the effect of this\r\nspirit?  From the desperate energy of purpose with which the gambler\r\npursues his object, from the passions which the practice calls into\r\nexercise, we might conjecture many. Such is the fact. In Middle\r\nFlorida, a _broken-winded_ negro is more common than a _broken-winded_\r\nhorse; though usually, when they are declared unsound, or when their\r\nconstitution is so broken that their recovery is despaired of, they\r\nare exported to New Orleans, to drag out the remainder of their days\r\nin the cane-field and sugar house. I would not insinuate that all\r\nplanters gamble upon their crops; but I mention the practice as one of\r\nthe common inducements to 'push niggers.' Neither would I assert that\r\nall planters drive the hands to the injury of their health. I give it\r\nas a _general_ rule in the district of Middle Florida, and I have no\r\nreason to think that negroes are driven worse there than in other\r\nfertile sections. People there told me that the situation of the\r\nslaves was far better than in Mississippi and Louisiana. And from\r\ncomparing the crops with those made in the latter states, and for\r\nother reasons, I am convinced of the truth of their statements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. DEMMING, a gentleman of high respectability, residing in Ashland,\r\nRichland county, Ohio, stated to Professor Wright, of New York city,\r\n\r\n\"That during a recent tour at the south, while ascending the Ohio\r\nriver, on the steamboat Fame, he had an opportunity of conversing with\r\na Mr. Dickinson, a resident of Pittsburg, in company with a number of\r\ncotton-planters and slave-dealers, from Louisiana, Alabama, and\r\nMississippi, Mr. Dickinson stated as a fact, that the sugar planters\r\nupon the sugar coast in Louisiana had ascertained, that, as it was\r\nusually necessary to employ about _twice_ the amount of labor during\r\nthe boiling season, that was required during the season of raising,\r\nthey could, by excessive driving, day and night, during the boiling\r\nseason, accomplish the whole labor _with one set of hands_. By\r\npursuing this plan, they could afford _to sacrifice a set of hands\r\nonce in seven years!_ He further stated that this horrible system was\r\nnow practised to a considerable extent! The correctness of this\r\nstatement was substantially admitted by the slaveholders then on\r\nboard.\"\r\n\r\nThe late MR. SAMUEL BLACKWELL, a highly respected citizen of Jersey\r\ncity, opposite the city of New York, and a member of the Presbyterian\r\nchurch, visited many of the sugar plantations in Louisiana a few years\r\nsince: and having for many years been the owner of an extensive sugar\r\nrefinery in England, and subsequently in this country, he had not only\r\nevery facility afforded him by the planters, for personal inspection\r\nof all parts of the process of sugar-making, but received from them\r\nthe most unreserved communications, as to their management of their\r\nslaves. Mr. B., after his return, frequently made the following\r\nstatement to gentlemen of his acquaintance,--\"That the planters\r\ngenerally declared to him, that they were _obliged_ so to over-work\r\ntheir slaves during the sugar-making season, (from eight to ten\r\nweeks,) as to use _them up_ in seven or eight years. For, said they,\r\nafter the process is commenced, it must be pushed without cessation,\r\nnight and day; and we cannot afford to keep a sufficient number of\r\nslaves to do the _extra_ work at the time of sugar-making, as we could\r\nnot profitably employ them the rest of the year.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not only true of the sugar planters, but of the slaveholders\r\ngenerally throughout the far south and south west, that they believe\r\nit for their interest to wear out the slaves by excessive toil in\r\neight or ten years after they put them into the field.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Alexander Jones. Esq., a large planter in West Feliciana,\r\nLouisiana, published a communication in the \"North Carolina True\r\nAmerican,\" Nov. 25, 1838, in which, speaking of the horses employed in\r\nthe mills on the plantations for ginning cotton, he says, they \"are\r\nmuch whipped and jaded;\" and adds, \"In fact, this service is so severe\r\non horses, as to shorten their lives in many instances, if not\r\nactually kill them in gear.\"\r\n\r\nThose who work one kind of their \"live stock\" so as to \"shorten their\r\nlives,\" or \"kill them in gear\" would not stick at doing the same thing\r\nto another kind.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. DOCTOR REED, of London, who went through Kentucky, Virginia and\r\nMaryland in the summer of 1834, gives the following testimony:\r\n\r\n\"I was told confidently and from _excellent authority_, that recently\r\nat a meeting of planters in South Carolina, the question was seriously\r\ndiscussed whether the slave is more profitable to the owner, if well\r\nfed, well clothed, and worked lightly, or if made the most of _at\r\nonce_, and exhausted in some eight years. The decision was in favor of\r\nthe last alternative. That decision will perhaps make many shudder.\r\nBut to my mind this is not the chief evil. The greater and original\r\nevil is considering the _slave as property_. If he is only property\r\nand my property, then I have some right to ask how I may make that\r\nproperty most available.\"\r\n\r\n\"Visit to the American Churches,\" by Rev. Drs. Reed and Mattheson.\r\nVol. 2 p. 173.\r\n\r\nREV. JOHN O. CHOULES, recently pastor of a Baptist Church at New\r\nBedford, Massachusetts, now of Buffalo, New York, made substantially\r\nthe following statement in a speech in Boston.\r\n\r\n\"While attending the Baptist Triennial Convention at Richmond,\r\nVirginia, in the spring of 1835, as a delegate from Massachusetts, I\r\nhad a conversation on slavery, with an officer of the Baptist Church\r\nin that city, at whose house I was a guest. I asked my host if he did\r\nnot apprehend that the slaves would eventually rise and exterminate\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said the gentleman, \"I used to apprehend such a catastrophe,\r\nbut God has made a providential opening, a _merciful safety valve_,\r\nand now I do not feel alarmed in the _prospect_ of what is coming.\r\n'What do you mean,' said Mr. Choules, 'by providence opening a merciful\r\nsafety valve?' Why, said the gentleman, I will tell you; the slave\r\ntraders come from the cotton and sugar plantations of the South and\r\nare willing to buy up more slaves than we can part with. We must keep\r\na stock for the purpose of _rearing_ slaves, but we part with the most\r\nvaluable, and at the same time, the most _dangerous_, and the demand\r\nis very constant and likely to be so, for when they go to these\r\nsouthern states, the average existence Is ONLY FIVE YEARS!\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur C.C. ROBIN, a highly intelligent French gentleman, who\r\nresided in Louisiana from 1802 to 1806, and published a volume of\r\ntravels, gives the following testimony to the over-working of the\r\nslaves there:\r\n\r\n\"I have been a witness, that after the fatigue of the day, their\r\nlabors have been prolonged several hours by the light of the moon; and\r\nthen, before they could think of rest, they must pound and cook their\r\ncorn; and yet, long before day, an implacable scold, whip in hand,\r\nwould arouse them from their slumbers. Thus, of more than twenty\r\nnegroes, who in twenty years should have doubled, the number _was\r\nreduced to four or five_.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we add, that slaveholders have in the most public and\r\nemphatic manner declared themselves guilty of barbarous inhumanity\r\ntoward their slaves in exacting from them such _long continued daily\r\nlabor_. The Legislatures of Maryland, Virginia and Georgia, have\r\npassed laws providing that convicts in their state prisons and\r\npenitentiaries, \"shall be employed in work each day in the year except\r\nSundays, not exceeding _eight_ hours, in the months of November,\r\nDecember, and January; _nine_ hours, in the months of February and\r\nOctober, and _ten_ hours in the rest of the year.\" Now contrast this\r\n_legal_ exaction of labor from CONVICTS with the exaction from slaves\r\nas established by the preceding testimony. The reader perceives that\r\nthe amount of time, in which by the preceding laws of Maryland,\r\nVirginia, and Georgia, the _convicts_ in their prisons are required to\r\nlabor, is on an average during the year but little more than NINE\r\nHOURS daily. Whereas, the laws of South Carolina permit the master to\r\n_compel_ his slaves to work FIFTEEN HOURS in the twenty-four, in\r\nsummer, and FOURTEEN in the winter--which would be in winter, from\r\ndaybreak in the morning until _four hours_ after sunset!--See 2\r\nBrevard's Digest, 243.\r\n\r\nThe other slave states, except Louisiana, have _no laws_ respecting\r\nthe labor of slaves, consequently if the master should work his slaves\r\nday and night without sleep till they drop dead, _he violates no law!_\r\n\r\nThe law of Louisiana provides for the slaves but TWO AND A HALF HOURS\r\nin the twenty-four for \"rest!\" See law of Louisiana, act of July 7\r\n1806, Martin's Digest 6. 10--12.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CLOTHING.\r\n\r\nWe propose to show under this head, that the clothing of the slaves by\r\nday, and their covering by night, are inadequate, either for comfort\r\nor decency.\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. T.T. Bouldin, a slave-holder, and member of Congress from Virginia\r\nin a speech in Congress, Feb. 16, 1835.\r\n\r\nMr. Bouldin said \"_he knew_ that many negroes had _died_ from exposure\r\nto weather,\" and added, \"they are clad in a _flimsy fabric, that will\r\nturn neither wind nor water_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Buchanan, M.D., of Baltimore, member of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, in an oration at Baltimore, July 4, 1791.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves, _naked_ and starved, _often_ fall victims to the\r\ninclemencies of the weather.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWm. Savery of Philadelphia, an eminent Minister of the Society of\r\nFriends, who went through the Southern states in 1791, on a religious\r\nvisit; after leaving Savannah, Ga., we find the following entry in his\r\njournal, 6th, month, 28, 1791.\r\n\r\n\"We rode through many rice swamps, where the blacks were very\r\nnumerous, great droves of these poor slaves, working up to the middle\r\nin water, men and women nearly _naked_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. John Rankin, of Ripley, Ohio, a native of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\"In every slave-holding state, _many slaves suffer extremely_, both\r\nwhile they labor and while they sleep, _for want of clothing_ to keep\r\nthem warm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Parrish, late of Philadelphia, a highly esteemed minister in the\r\nSociety of Friends, who travelled through the South in 1804.\r\n\r\n\"It is shocking to the feelings of humanity, in travelling through\r\nsome of those states, to see those poor objects, [slaves,] especially\r\nin the inclement season, in _rags_, and _trembling with the cold_.\"\r\n\r\n\"They suffer them, both male and female, _to go without clothing_ at\r\nthe age of ten and twelve years\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev.

I have been on many plantations where\r\nchildren of eight and ten yeas old, were in a state of _perfect\r\nnudity_. Slaves are _in general wretchedly clad_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWm. Ladd, Esq., of Minot, Maine, recently a slaveholder in Florida.\r\n\r\n\"They were allowed two suits of clothes a year, viz. one pair of\r\ntrowsers with a shirt or frock of osnaburgh for summer; and for\r\nwinter, one pair of trowsers, and a jacket of negro cloth, with a\r\nbaize shirt and a pair of shoes. Some allowed hats, and some did not;\r\nand they were generally, I believe, allowed one blanket in two years.\r\nGarments of similar materials were allowed the women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Kentucky physician, writing in the Western Medical Reformer, in\r\n1836, on the diseases peculiar to slaves, says.\r\n\r\n\"They are _imperfectly clothed_ both summer and winter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Stephen E. Maltby, Inspector of provisions, Skeneateles, N.Y., who\r\nresided sometime in Alabama.\r\n\r\n\"I was at Huntsville, Alabama, in 1818-19, I frequently saw slaves on\r\nand around the public square, _with hardly a rag of clothing on them_,\r\nand in a _great many_ instances with but a single garment both in\r\nsummer and in winter; generally the only bedding of the slaves was a\r\n_blanket_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReuben G. Macy, Hudson, N.Y. member of the Society of Friends, who\r\nresided in South Carolina, in 1818 and 19.\r\n\r\n\"Their clothing consisted of a pair of trowsers and jacket, made of\r\n'negro cloth.' The women a petticoat, a very short 'short-gown,' and\r\n_nothing else_, the same kind of cloth; some of the women had an old\r\npair of shoes, but they _generally went barefoot_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lemuel Sapington, of Lancaster, Pa., a native of Maryland, and\r\nformerly a slaveholder.\r\n\r\n\"Their clothing is often made by themselves after night, though\r\nsometimes assisted by the old women, who are no longer able to do\r\nout-door work; consequently it is harsh and uncomfortable. And I have\r\nvery frequently seen those who had not attained the age of twelve\r\nyears _go naked_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilemon Bliss, Esq., a lawyer in Elyria, Ohio, who lived in Florida\r\nin 1834 and 35.\r\n\r\n\"It is very common to see the younger class of slaves up to eight or\r\nten _without any clothing_, and most generally the laboring men wear\r\n_no shirts_ in the warm season. The perfect nudity of the younger\r\nslaves is so familiar to the whites of both sexes, that they seem to\r\nwitness it with perfect indifference. I may add that the aged and\r\nfeeble often _suffer from cold_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Macy, a member of the Society of Friends, Hudson, N.Y., who\r\nhas lived in Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"For _bedding_ each slave was allowed _one blanket_, in which they\r\nrolled themselves up.

Mr. Fisher, Baptist Minister of Quincy.\r\n\r\n\"We have been acquainted with the brother who has communicated to you\r\nsome facts that fell under his observation, whilst in his native\r\nstate; he is a professed follower of our Lord, and we have great\r\nconfidence in him as a man of integrity, discretion, and strict\r\nChristian principle. RICHARD EELLS. EZRA FISHER.\"\r\n\r\nQuincy, Jan. 9th, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY.--\"I lived for thirty years in Virginia, and have travelled\r\nextensively through Fauquier, Culpepper, Jefferson, Stafford,\r\nAlbemarle and Charlotte Counties; my remarks apply to these Counties.\r\n\r\n\"The negro houses are miserably poor, generally they are a shelter\r\nfrom neither the wind, the rain, nor the snow, and the earth is the\r\nfloor. There are exceptions to this rule, but they are only\r\nexceptions; you may sometimes see puncheon floor, but never, or almost\r\nnever a plank floor. The slaves are generally without _beds or\r\nbedsteads_; some few have cribs that they fasten up for themselves in\r\nthe corner of the hut. Their bed-clothes are a nest of rags thrown\r\nupon a crib, or in the corner; sometimes there are three or four\r\nfamilies in one small cabin. Where the slaveholders have more than one\r\nfamily, they put them in the same quarter till it is filled, then\r\nbuild another. I have seen exceptions to this, when only one family\r\nwould occupy a hut, and where were tolerably comfortable bed-clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the slaves in these counties are _miserably clad_. I have\r\nknown slaves who went without shoes all winter, perfectly barefoot.\r\nThe feet of many of them are frozen. As a general fact the planters do\r\nnot serve out to their slaves, drawers, or any under clothing, or\r\nvests, or overcoats. Slaves sometimes, by working at night and on\r\nSundays, get better things than their masters serve to them.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst these things are true of _field-hands_, it is also true that\r\nmany slaveholders clothe their _waiters_ and coachmen like gentlemen.\r\nI do not think there is any difference between the slaves of\r\nprofessing Christians and others; at all events, it is so small as to\r\nbe scarcely noticeable.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen men and women at work in the field more than half naked:\r\nand more than once in passing, when the overseer was not near, they\r\nwould stop and draw round them a tattered coat or some ribbons of a\r\nskirt to hide their nakedness and shame from the stranger's eye.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE W. WESTGATE, a member of the Congregational Church in\r\nQuincy, Illinois, who has spent the larger part of twelve years\r\nnavigating the rivers of the south-western slave states with keel\r\nboats, as a trader, gives the following testimony as to the clothing\r\nand lodging of the slaves.\r\n\r\n\"In lower Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana, the clothing of the\r\nslaves is wretchedly poor; and grows worse as you go south, in the\r\norder of the states I have named. The only material is cotton bagging,\r\ni.e. bagging in which cotton is _baled_, not bagging made of cotton.\r\nIn Louisiana, especially in the lower country, I have frequently seen\r\nthem with nothing but a tattered coat, not sufficient to hide their\r\nnakedness. In winter their clothing seldom serves the purpose of\r\ncomfort, and frequently not even of decent covering. In Louisiana _the\r\nplanters never think of serving out shoes to slaves_. In Mississippi\r\nthey give one pair a year generally. I never saw or heard of an\r\ninstance of masters allowing them _stockings_. A _small poor blanket\r\nis generally the only bed-clothing_, and this they frequently wear in\r\nthe field when they have not sufficient clothing to hide their\r\nnakedness or to keep them warm. Their manner of sleeping varies with\r\nthe season. In hot weather they stretch themselves anywhere and sleep.\r\nAs it becomes cool they roll themselves in their blankets, and lay\r\nscattered about the cabin. In cold weather they nestle together with\r\ntheir feet towards the fire, promiscuously. As a general fact the\r\nearth is their only floor and bed--not one in ten have anything like a\r\nbedstead, and then it is a mere bunk put up by themselves.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE A. AVERY, an elder in the fourth Congregational Church,\r\nRochester, N.Y., who spent four years in Virginia, says, \"The slave\r\nchildren, very commonly of both sexes, up to the ages of eight and ten\r\nyears, and I think in some instances beyond this age, go in a state of\r\n_disgusting_ nudity. I have often seen them with their tow shirt\r\n(their only article of summer clothing) which, to all human\r\nappearance, had not been taken off from the time it was first put on,\r\nworn off from the bottom upwards shred by shred, until nothing\r\nremained but the straps which passed over their shoulders, and the\r\nless exposed portions extending a very little way below the arms,\r\nleaving the principal part of the chest, as well as the limbs,\r\nentirely uncovered.\"\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ELLISON, a member of the Society of Friends, formerly of\r\nSouthampton Co., Virginia, now of Marlborough, Stark Co., Ohio, says,\r\n\"I knew a Methodist who was the owner of a number of slaves. The\r\nchildren of both sexes, belonging to him, under twelve years of age,\r\nwere _entirely_ destitute of clothing. I have seen an old man\r\ncompelled to labor in the fields, not having rags enough to cover his\r\nnakedness.\"\r\n\r\nRev. H. LYMAN, late pastor of the Free Presbyterian Church, in\r\nBuffalo, N.Y., in describing a tour down and up the Mississippi river\r\nin the winter of 1832-3, says, \"At the wood yards where the boats\r\nstop, it is not uncommon to see female slaves employed in carrying\r\nwood. Their dress which was quite uniform was provided without any\r\nreference to comfort. They had no covering for their heads; the stuff\r\nwhich constituted the outer garment was sackcloth, similar to that in\r\nwhich brown domestic goods are done up. It was then December, and I\r\nthought that in such a dress, and being as they were, without\r\n_stockings_, they must suffer from the cold.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin Clendenon, Colerain, Lancaster Co., Pa., a member of the\r\nSociety of Friends, in a recent letter describing a short tour through\r\nthe northern part of Maryland in the winter of 1836, thus speaks of a\r\nplace a few miles from Chestertown. \"About this place there were a\r\nnumber of slaves; very few, if any, had _either stockings or shoes_;\r\nthe weather was intensely cold, and the ground covered with snow.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Major Stoddard of the United States' artillery, who took\r\npossession of Louisiana for the U.S. government, under the cession of\r\n1804, published a book entitled \"Sketches of Louisiana,\" in which,\r\nspeaking of the planters of Lower Louisiana, he says, \"_Few of them\r\nallow any clothing to their slaves_.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from the Will of the late celebrated John\r\nRandolph of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"To my old and faithful servants, Essex and his wife Hetty, I give and\r\nbequeath a pair of strong shoes, a suit of clothes and a blanket each,\r\nto be paid them annually; also an annual hat to Essex.\"\r\n\r\nNo Virginia slaveholder has ever had a better name as a \"kind master,\"\r\nand \"good provider\" for his slaves, than John Randolph. Essex and\r\nHetty were _favorite_ servants, and the memory of the long\r\nuncompensated services of those \"old and faithful servants,\" seems to\r\nhave touched their master's heart. Now as this master was _John\r\nRandolph_, and as those servants were \"faithful,\" and favorite\r\nservants, advanced in years, and worn out in his service, and as their\r\nallowance was, in their master's eyes, of sufficient moment to\r\nconstitute a paragraph in his last _will and testament_, it is fair to\r\ninfer that it would be _very liberal_, far better than the ordinary\r\nallowance for slaves.\r\n\r\nNow we leave the reader to judge what must be the _usual_ allowance of\r\nclothing to common field slaves in the hands of common masters, when\r\nEssex and Hetty, the \"old\" and \"faithful\" slaves of John Randolph,\r\nwere provided, in his last will and testament, with but _one_ suit of\r\nclothes annually, with but _one blanket_ each for bedding, with no\r\n_stockings_, nor _socks_, nor _cloaks_, nor overcoats, nor\r\n_handkerchiefs_, nor _towels_, and with no _change_ either of under or\r\noutside garments!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

President of the American Peace\r\nSociety, formerly a slaveholder in Florida.\r\n\r\n\"The dwellings of the slaves were palmetto huts, built by themselves\r\nof stakes and poles, thatched with the palmetto leaf. The door, when\r\nthey had any, was generally of the same materials, sometimes boards\r\nfound on the beach. They had _no floors_, no separate apartments,\r\nexcept the guinea negroes had sometimes a small inclosure for their\r\n'god house.' These huts the slaves built themselves after task and on\r\nSundays.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Joseph M. Sadd, Pastor Pres. Church, Castile, Greene Co., N.Y.,\r\nwho lived in Missouri five years previous to 1837.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves live _generally_ in _miserable huts_, which are _without\r\nfloors_, and have a single apartment only, where both sexes are herded\r\npromiscuously together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. George W. Westgate, member of the Congregational Church in Quincy,\r\nIllinois, who has spent a number of years in slave states.\r\n\r\n\"On old plantations, the negro quarters are of frame and clapboards,\r\nseldom affording a comfortable shelter from wind or rain; their size\r\nvaries from 8 by 10, to 10 by 12, feet, and six or eight feet high;\r\nsometimes there is a hole cut for a window, but I never saw a sash, or\r\nglass in any. In the new country, and in the woods, the quarters are\r\ngenerally built of logs, of similar dimensions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Cornelius Johnson, a member of a Christian Church in Farmington,\r\nOhio. Mr. J. lived in Mississippi in 1837-8.\r\n\r\n\"Their houses were commonly built of logs, sometimes they were framed,\r\noften they had no floor, some of them have two apartments, commonly\r\nbut one; each of those apartments contained a family. Sometimes these\r\nfamilies consisted of a man and his wife and children, while in other\r\ninstances persons of both sexes, were thrown together without any\r\nregard to family relationship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Western Medical Reformer, in an article on the Cachexia Africana\r\nby a Kentucky physician, thus speaks of the huts of the slaves.\r\n\r\n\"They are _crowded_ together in a _small hut_, and sometimes having an\r\nimperfect, and sometimes no floor, and seldom raised from the ground,\r\nill ventilated, and surrounded with filth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. William Leftwich, a native of Virginia, but has resided most of\r\nhis life in Madison, Co.

Macy of Hudson, N.Y. a member of the Religious Society of\r\nFriends. He lived in South Carolina in 1818-19.\r\n\r\n\"The houses for the field slaves were about 14 feet square, built in\r\nthe coarsest manner, with one room, _without any chimney or flooring,\r\nwith a hole in the roof to let the smoke out_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lemuel Sapington of Lancaster, Pa. a native of Maryland, formerly\r\na slaveholder.\r\n\r\n\"The descriptions generally given of negro quarters, are correct; the\r\nquarters are _without floors, and not sufficient to keep off the\r\ninclemency of the weather_; they are uncomfortable both in summer and\r\nwinter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. John Rankin, a native of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\"When they return to their miserable huts at night, they find not\r\nthere the means of comfortable rest; _but on the cold ground they must\r\nlie without covering, and shiver while they slumber.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilemon Bliss, Esq. Elyria, Ohio, who lived in Florida, in 1835.\r\n\r\n\"The dwellings of the slaves are usually small _open_ log huts, with\r\nbut one apartment, and very generally _without floors_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. W.C.

TREATMENT OF THE SICK.\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVES SUFFER FROM HUMAN NEGLECT WHEN SICK\r\n\r\nIn proof of this we subjoin the following testimony:\r\n\r\nRev. Dr. CHANNING of Boston, who once resided in Virginia, relates the\r\nfollowing fact in his work on slavery, page 163, 1st edition.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot forget my feelings on visiting a hospital belonging to the\r\nplantation of a gentleman _highly esteemed for his virtues_, and whose\r\nmanners and conversation expressed much _benevolence and\r\nconscientiousness_. When I entered with him the hospital, the first\r\nobject on which my eye fell was a young woman, very ill, probably\r\napproaching death. She was stretched on the floor. Her head rested on\r\nsomething like a pillow; but _her body and limbs were extended on the\r\nhard boards._ The owner, I doubt not, had at least as much kindness\r\nas myself; but he was so used to see the slaves living without common\r\ncomforts, that the idea of unkindness in the present instance did not\r\nenter his mind.\"\r\n\r\nThis _dying_ young woman \"was _stretched on the floor_\"--\"her body and\r\nlimbs extended upon the hard boards,\"--and yet her master \"was highly\r\nesteemed for his virtues,\" and his general demeanor produced upon Dr.\r\nChanning the impression of \"benevolence and conscientiousness\" If the\r\n_sick and dying female_ slaves of _such_ a master, suffer such\r\nbarbarous neglect, whose heart does not fail him, at the thought of\r\nthat inhumanity, exercised by the _majority_ of slaveholders, towards\r\ntheir aged, sick, and dying victims.\r\n\r\nThe following testimony is furnished by SARAH M. GRIMKÉ, a sister of\r\nthe late Hon. Thomas S. Grimké, of Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"When the Ladies' Benevolent Society in Charleston, S.C., of which I\r\nwas a visiting commissioner, first went into operation, we were\r\napplied to for the relief of several sick and aged colored persons;\r\none case I particularly remember, of an aged woman who was dreadfully\r\nburnt from having fallen into the fire; she was living with some free\r\nblacks who had taken her in out of compassion. On inquiry, we found\r\nthat _nearly all_ the colored persons who had solicited aid, were\r\n_slaves_, who being no longer able to work for their \"owners,\" were\r\nthus inhumanly cast out in their sickness and old age, and must have\r\nperished, but for the kindness of their friends.\r\n\r\n\"I was once visiting a sick slave in whose spiritual welfare peculiar\r\ncircumstances had led me to be deeply interested. I knew that she had\r\nbeen early seduced from the path of virtue, as nearly all the female\r\nslaves are. I knew also that her mistress, though a professor of\r\nreligion, had never taught her a single precept of Christianity, yet\r\nthat she had had her severely punished for this departure from them,\r\nand that the poor girl was then ill of an incurable disease,\r\noccasioned partly by her own misconduct, and partly by the cruel\r\ntreatment she had received, in a situation that called for tenderness\r\nand care. Her heart seemed truly touched with repentance for her sins,\r\nand she was inquiring, \"What shall I do to be saved?\" I was sitting by\r\nher as she lay on the floor upon a blanket, and was trying to\r\nestablish her trembling spirit in the fullness of Jesus, when I heard\r\nthe voice of her mistress in loud and angry tones, as she approached\r\nthe door. I read in the countenance of the prostrate sufferer, the\r\nterror which she felt at the prospect of seeing her mistress. I knew\r\nmy presence would be very unwelcome, but staid hoping that it might\r\nrestrain, in some measure, the passions of the mistress. In this,\r\nhowever, I was mistaken; she passed me without apparently observing\r\nthat I was there, and seated herself on the other side of the sick\r\nslave. She made no inquiry how she was, but in a tone of anger\r\ncommenced a tirade of abuse, violently reproaching her with her past\r\nmisconduct, and telling her in the most unfeeling manner, that eternal\r\ndestruction awaited her. No word of kindness escaped her. What had\r\nthen roused her temper I do not know. She continued in this strain\r\nseveral minutes, when I attempted to soften her by remarking, that\r\n------ was very ill, and she ought not thus to torment her, and that I\r\nbelieved Jesus had granted her forgiveness. But I might as well have\r\ntried to stop the tempest in its career, as to calm the infuriated\r\npassions nurtured by the exercise of arbitrary power. She looked at me\r\nwith ineffable scorn, and continued to pour forth a torrent of abuse\r\nand reproach. Her helpless victim listened in terrified silence, until\r\nnature could endure no more, when she uttered a wild shriek, and\r\ncasting on her tormentor a look of unutterable agony, exclaimed, \"Oh,\r\nmistress, I am dying.\" This appeal arrested her attention, and she soon\r\nleft the room, but in the same spirit with which she entered it. The\r\ngirl survived but a few days, and, I believe, saw her mistress _no\r\nmore_\"\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE A. AVERY, an elder of a Presbyterian church in Rochester,\r\nN.Y., who lived some years in Virginia, gives the following:\r\n\r\n\"The manner of treating the sick slaves, and especially in _chronic_\r\ncases, was to my mind peculiarly revolting. My opportunities for\r\nobservation in this department were better than in, perhaps, any\r\nother, as the friend under whose direction I commenced my medical\r\nstudies, enjoyed a high reputation as a _surgeon_. I rode considerably\r\nwith him in his practice, and assisted in the surgical operations and\r\ndressings from time to time. In confirmed cases of disease, it was\r\ncommon for the master to place the subject under the care of a\r\nphysician or surgeon, at whose expense the patient should be kept, and\r\nif death ensued to the patient, or the disease was not cured, no\r\ncompensation was to be made, but if cured a bonus of one, two, or\r\nthree hundred dollars was to be given. No provision was made against\r\nthe _barbarity_ or _neglect_ of the physician, &c. I have seen\r\n_fifteen or twenty of these helpless sufferers_ crowded together in\r\nthe true spirit of slaveholding inhumanity, like the \"brutes that\r\nperish,\" and driven from time to time _like_ brutes into a common\r\nyard, where they had to suffer any and every operation and experiment,\r\nwhich interest, caprice, or professional curiosity might\r\nprompt,--unrestrained by law, public sentiment, or the claims of\r\ncommon humanity.\"\r\n\r\nRev. WILLIAM T. ALLAN, son of Rev. Dr. Allan, a slaveholder, of\r\nHuntsville, Alabama, says in a letter now before us:\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Robert H. Watkins, of Laurence county, Alabama, who owned\r\nabout three hundred slaves, after employing a physician among them for\r\nsome time, ceased to do so, alleging as the reason, that it was\r\ncheaper to lose a few negroes every year than to pay a physician. This\r\nColonel Watkins was a Presidential elector in 1836.\"\r\n\r\nA.A. GUTHRIE, Esq., elder in the Presbyterian church at Putnam,\r\nMuskingum county, Ohio, furnishes the testimony which follows.\r\n\r\n\"A near female friend of mine in company with another young lady, in\r\nattempting to visit a sick woman on Washington's Bottom, Wood county,\r\nVirginia, missed the way, and stopping to ask directions of a group of\r\ncolored children on the outskirts of the plantation of Francis Keen,\r\nSen., they were told to ask 'aunty, in the house.'  On entering the\r\nhut, says my informant, I beheld such a sight as I hope never to see\r\nagain; its sole occupant was a female slave of the said Keen--her\r\nwhole wearing apparel consisted of a frock, made of the coarsest tow\r\ncloth, and so scanty, that it could not have been made more tight\r\naround her person. In the hut there was neither table, chair, nor\r\nchest--a stool and a rude fixture in one corner, were all its\r\nfurniture. On this last were a little straw and a few old remnants of\r\nwhat had been bedding--all exceedingly filthy.\r\n\r\n\"The woman thus situated _had been for more than a day in travail_,\r\nwithout any assistance, any nurse, or any kind of proper\r\nprovision--during the night she said some fellow slave woman would\r\nstay with her, and the aforesaid children through the day. From a\r\nwoman, who was a slave of Keen's at the same time, my informant\r\nlearned, that this poor woman suffered for three days, and then\r\ndied--when too late to save her life her master sent assistance. It\r\nwas understood to be a rule of his, to neglect his women entirely in\r\nsuch times of trial, unless they previously came and informed him,\r\nand asked for aid.\"\r\n\r\nRev. PHINEAS SMITH, of Centreville, N.Y, who has resided four years\r\nat the south, says:\r\n\r\n\"Often when the slaves are sick, their accustomed toil is exacted from\r\nthem. Physicians are rarely called for their benefit.\"\r\n\r\nRev. HORACE MOULTON, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal church in\r\nMarlborough, Mass., who resided a number of years in Georgia, says:\r\n\r\n\"Another dark side of slavery is the neglect of the _aged_ and\r\n_sick_. Many when sick, are suspected by their masters of _feigning_\r\nsickness, and are therefore whipped out to work after disease has got\r\nfast hold of them; when the masters learn, that they are really sick,\r\nthey are in many instances left alone in their cabins during work\r\nhours; not a few of the slaves are left to die without having one\r\nfriend to wipe off the sweat of death. When the slaves are sick, the\r\nmasters do not, as a general thing, employ physicians, but \"doctor\"\r\nthem themselves, and their mode of practice in almost all cases is to\r\nbleed and give salts. When women are confined they have no physician,\r\nbut are committed to the care of slave midwives. Slaves complain very\r\nlittle when sick, when they die they are frequently buried at night\r\nwithout much ceremony, and in many instances without any; their\r\ncoffins are made by nailing together rough boards, frequently with\r\ntheir feet sticking out at the end, and sometimes they are put into\r\nthe ground without a coffin or box of any kind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL NARRATIVES--PART II.\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THE REV. WILLIAM T. ALLAN, LATE OF ALABAMA.\r\n\r\nMr. ALLAN is a son of the Rev. Dr. Allan, a slaveholder and pastor of\r\nthe Presbyterian Church at Huntsville, Alabama. He has recently\r\nbecome the pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Chatham, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"I was born and have lived most of my life in the slave states, mainly\r\nin the village of Huntsville, Alabama, where my parents still reside.\r\nI seldom went to a _plantation_, and as my visits were confined almost\r\nexclusively to the families of professing Christians, my _personal_\r\nknowledge of slavery, was consequently a knowledge of its _fairest_\r\nside, (if fairest may be predicated of foul.)\r\n\r\n\"There was one plantation just opposite my father's house in the\r\nsuburbs of Huntsville, belonging to Judge Smith, formerly a Senator in\r\nCongress from South Carolina, now of Huntsville. The name of his\r\noverseer was Tune. I have often seen him flogging the slaves in the\r\nfield, and have often heard their cries. Sometimes, too, I have met\r\nthem with the tears streaming down their faces, and the marks of the\r\nwhip, ('whelks,') on their bare necks and shoulders. Tune was so\r\nsevere in his treatment, that his employer dismissed him after two or\r\nthree years, lest, it was said, he should kill off all the slaves. But\r\nhe was immediately employed by another planter in the neighborhood.\r\nThe following fact was stated to me by my brother, James M. Allan, now\r\nresiding at Richmond, Henry county, Illinois, and clerk of the circuit\r\nand county courts. Tune became displeased with one of the women who\r\nwas pregnant, he made her lay down over a log, with her face towards\r\nthe ground, and beat her so unmercifully, that she was soon after\r\ndelivered of a _dead child_.\r\n\r\n\"My brother also stated to me the following, which occurred near my\r\nfather's house, and within sight and hearing of the academy and public\r\ngarden. Charles, a fine active negro, who belonged to a bricklayer in\r\nHuntsville, exchanged the burning sun of the brickyard to enjoy for a\r\nseason the pleasant shade of an adjacent mountain. When his master got\r\nhim back, he tied him by his hands so that his feet could just touch\r\nthe ground--stripped off his clothes, took a paddle, bored full of\r\nholes, and paddled him leisurely all day long. It was two weeks before\r\nthey could tell whether he would live or die. Neither of these cases\r\nattracted any particular notice in Huntsville.\r\n\r\n\"While I lived in Huntsville a slave was killed in the mountain near\r\nby. The circumstances were these. A white man (James Helton) hunting\r\nin the woods, suddenly came upon a black man, and commanded him to\r\nstop, the slave kept on running, Helton fired his rifle and the negro\r\nwas killed.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This murder was committed about twelve years since. At\r\nthat time, James G. Birney, Esq., now Corresponding Secretary of the\r\nAmerican Anti-Slavery Society was the Solicitor (prosecuting attorney)\r\nfor that judicial district. His views and feelings upon the subject of\r\nslavery were, even at that period, in advance of the mass of\r\nslaveholders, and he determined if possible to bring the murderer to\r\njustice. He accordingly drew up an indictment and procured the finding\r\nof a true bill against Helton. Helton, meanwhile, moved over the line\r\ninto the state of Tennessee, and such was the apathy of the community,\r\nindividual effort proved unavailing; and though the murderer had gone\r\nno further than to an adjoining county (where perhaps he still\r\nresides) he was never brought to trial.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Barr, wife of Rev. H. Barr of Carrollton, Illinois, formerly\r\nfrom Courtland, Alabama, told me last spring, that she has very often\r\nstopped her ears that she might not hear the screams of slaves who\r\nwere under the lash, and that sometimes she has left her house, and\r\nretired to a place more distant, in order to get away from their\r\nagonizing cries.\r\n\r\n\"I have often seen groups of slaves on the public squares in\r\nHuntsville, who were to be sold at auction, and I have often seen\r\ntheir tears gush forth and their countenances distorted with anguish.\r\nA considerable number were generally sold publicly every month.\r\n\r\n\"The following facts I have just taken down from the lips of Mr. L.\r\nTurner, a regular and respectable member of the Second Presbyterian\r\nChurch in Springfield, our county town. He was born and brought up in\r\nCaroline county, Virginia. He says that the slaves are neither\r\nconsidered nor treated as human beings. One of his neighbors whose\r\nname was Barr, he says, on one occasion stripped a slave and lacerated\r\nhis back with a handcard (for cotton or wool) and then washed it with\r\nsalt and water, with pepper in it. Mr. Turner _saw_ this. He further\r\nremarked that he believed there were _many_ slaves there in advanced\r\nlife whose backs had never been well since they began to work.\r\n\r\n\"He stated that one of his uncles had killed a woman--broke her skull\r\nwith an ax helve: she had insulted her mistress! No notice was taken\r\nof the affair. Mr. T. said, further, that slaves were _frequently\r\nmurdered_.\r\n\r\n\"He mentioned the case of one slaveholder, whom he had seen lay his\r\nslaves on a large log, which he kept for the purpose, strip them, tie\r\nthem with the face downward, then have a kettle of hot water\r\nbrought--take the paddle, made of hard wood, and perforated with\r\nholes, dip it into the hot water and strike--before every blow dipping\r\nit into the water--every hole at every blow would raise a 'whelk.'\r\nThis was the usual punishment fur _running away_.\r\n\r\n\"Another slaveholder had a slave who had often run away, and often\r\nbeen severely whipped. After one of his floggings he burnt his master's\r\nbarn: this so enraged the man, that when he caught him he took a pair\r\nof pincers and pulled his toe nails out. The negro then murdered two\r\nof his master's children. He was taken after a desperate pursuit,\r\n(having been shot through the shoulder) and hung.\r\n\r\n\"One of Mr. Turner's cousins, was employed as overseer on a large\r\nplantation in Mississippi. On a certain morning he called the slaves\r\ntogether, to give some orders. While doing it, a slave came running\r\nout of his cabin, having a knife in his hand and eating his breakfast.\r\nThe overseer seeing him coming with the knife, was somewhat alarmed,\r\nand instantly raised his gun and shot him dead. He said afterwards,\r\nthat he believed the slave was perfectly innocent of any evil\r\nintentions, he came out hastily to hear the orders whilst eating. _No_\r\nnotice was taken of the killing.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. T. related the whipping habits of one of his uncles in Virginia.\r\nHe was a wealthy man, had a splendid house and grounds. A tree in his\r\n_front yard_, was used as a _whipping post_. When a slave was to be\r\npunished, he would frequently invite some of his friends, have a\r\ntable, cards and wine set out under the shade; he would then flog his\r\nslave a little while, and then play cards and drink with his friends,\r\noccasionally taunting the slave, giving him the privilege of\r\nconfessing such and such things, at his leisure, after a while flog\r\nhim again, thus keeping it up for hours or half the day, and sometimes\r\nall day. This was his _habit_.\r\n\r\n\"_February 4th._--Since writing the preceding, I have been to\r\nCarrollton, on a visit to my uncle, Rev. Hugh Barr, who was originally\r\nfrom Tennessee, lived 12 or 14 years in Courtland, Lawrence county,\r\nAlabama, and moved to Illinois in 1835. In conversation with the\r\nfamily, around the fireside, they stated a multitude of horrid facts,\r\nthat were perfectly notorious in the neighborhood of Courtland.\r\n\r\n\"William P. Barr, an intelligent young man, and member of his father's\r\nchurch in Carrollton, stated the following. Visiting at a Mr.\r\nMosely's, near Courtland, William Mosely came in with a bloody knife\r\nin his hand, having just stabbed a negro man. The negro was sitting\r\nquietly in a house in the village, keeping a woman company who had\r\nbeen left in charge of the house,--when Mosely, passing along, went in\r\nand demanded his business there. Probably his answer was not as civil\r\nas slaveholding requires, Mosely rushed upon him and stabbed him. The\r\nwound laid him up for a season. Mosley was called to no account for\r\nit. When he came in with the bloody knife, he said he wished he had\r\nkilled him.\r\n\r\n\"John Brown, a slaveholder, and a member of the Presbyterian church in\r\nCourtland, Alabama, stated the following a few weeks since, in\r\nCarrollton. A man near Courtland, of the name of Thompson, recently\r\nshot a negro _woman_ through the head; and put the pistol so close\r\nthat her hair was singed. He did it in consequence of some difficulty\r\nin his dealings with her as a concubine. He buried her in a log heap;\r\nshe was discovered by the buzzards gathering around it.\r\n\r\n\"William P. Barr stated the following, as facts well known in the\r\nneighborhood of Courtland, but not witnessed by himself. Two men, by\r\nthe name of Wilson, found a fine looking negro man at 'Dandridge's\r\nQuarter,' without a pass; and flogged him so that he died in a short\r\ntime. They were not punished.\r\n\r\n\"Col. Blocker's overseer attempted to flog a negro--he refused to be\r\nflogged; whereupon the overseer seized an axe, and cleft his skull.\r\nThe Colonel justified it.\r\n\r\n\"One Jones whipped a woman to death for 'grabbling' a potato hill. He\r\nowned 80 or 100 negroes. His own children could not live with him.\r\n\r\n\"A man in the neighborhood of Courtland, Alabama, by the name of\r\nPuryear, was so proverbially cruel that among the negroes he was\r\nusually called 'the Devil.' Mrs. Barr, wife of Rev. H. Barr, was at\r\nPuryear's house, and saw a negro girl about 13 years old, waiting\r\naround the table, with a single garment--and that in cold weather;\r\narms and feet bare--feet wretchedly swollen--arms burnt, and full of\r\nsores from exposure. All the negroes under his care made a wretched\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\"Col. Robert H. Watkins had a runaway slave, who was called Jim\r\nDragon. Before he was caught the last time, he had been out a year,\r\nwithin a few miles of his master's plantation. He never stole from any\r\none but his master, except when necessity compelled him. He said he\r\nhad a right to take from his master; and when taken, that he had,\r\nwhilst out, seen his master a hundred times. Having been whipped,\r\nclogged with irons, and yoked, he was set at work in the field. Col.\r\nWatkins worked about 300 hands--generally had one negro out hunting\r\nrunaways. After employing a physician for some time among his negroes,\r\nhe ceased to do so, alleging as the reason, that it was cheaper to\r\nlose a few negroes every year than to pay a physician. He was a\r\nPresidential elector in 1836.\r\n\r\n\"Col. Ben Sherrod, another large planter in that neighborhood, is\r\nremarkable for his kindness to his slaves. He said to Rev. Mr. Barr,\r\nthat he had no doubt he should be rewarded in heaven for his kindness\r\nto his slaves; and yet his overseer, Walker, had to sleep with loaded\r\npistols, for fear of assassination. Three of the slaves attempted to\r\nkill him once, because of his _treatment of their wives_.\r\n\r\n\"Old Major Billy Watkins was noted for his severity. I well remember,\r\nwhen he lived in Madison county, to have often heard him yell at his\r\nnegroes with the most savage fury. He would stand at his house, and\r\nwatch the slaves picking cotton; and if any of them straitened their\r\nbacks for a moment, his savage yell would ring, 'bend your backs.'\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Barr stated, that Mrs. H----, of Courtland, a member of the\r\nPresbyterian church, sent a little negro girl to jail, suspecting that\r\nshe had attempted to put poison in the water pail. The fact was, that\r\nthe child had found a vial, and was playing in the water. This same\r\nwoman (in high standing too,) told the Rev. Mr. McMillan, that she\r\ncould 'cut Arthur Tappan's throat from ear to ear.'\r\n\r\n\"The clothing of slaves is in many cases comfortable, and in many it\r\nis far from being so. I have very often seen slaves, whose tattered\r\nrags were neither comfortable nor decent.\r\n\r\n\"Their _huts_ are sometimes comfortable, but generally they are\r\nmiserable _hovels_, where male and female are herded promiscuously\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"As to the _usual_ allowance of food on the plantations in North\r\nAlabama, I cannot speak confidently, from _personal_ knowledge. There\r\nwas a slave named Hadley, who was in the habit of visiting my father's\r\nslaves occasionally. He had run away several times. His reason was, as\r\nhe stated, that they would not give him any meat--said he could not\r\nwork without meat. The last time I saw him, he had quite a heavy iron\r\nyoke on his neck, the two prongs twelve or fifteen inches long,\r\nextending out over his shoulders and bending upwards.\r\n\r\n\"_Legal_ marriage is unknown among the slaves, they sometimes have a\r\nmarriage form--generally, however, _none at all_. The pastor of the\r\nPresbyterian church in Huntsville, had two families of slaves when I\r\nleft there. One couple were married by a negro preacher--the man was\r\nrobbed of his wife a number of months afterwards, by her '_owner_.'\r\nThe other couple just 'took up together,' without any form of\r\nmarriage. They are both members of churches--the man a Baptist deacon,\r\nsober and correct in his deportment. They have a large family of\r\nchildren--all children of concubinage--living in a minister's family.\r\n\r\n\"If these statements are deemed of any value by you, in forwarding\r\nyour glorious enterprize, you are at liberty to use them as you\r\nplease. The great wrong is _enslaving a man_; all other wrongs are\r\npigmies, compared with that. Facts might be gathered abundantly, to\r\nshow that it is _slavery itself_, and not cruelties merely, that make\r\nslaves unhappy. Even those that are most kindly treated, are generally\r\nfar from being happy. The slaves in my father's family are almost as\r\nkindly treated as _slaves_ can be, yet they pant for liberty.\r\n\r\n\"May the Lord guide you in this great movement. In behalf of the\r\nperishing, Your friend and brother, WILLIAM. T. ALLAN\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF MR. WILLIAM LEFTWICH, A NATIVE OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nMr. Leftwich is a grandson of Gen. Jabez Leftwich, who was for some\r\nyears a member of Congress from Virginia. Though born in Virginia, he\r\nhas resided most of his life in Alabama. He now lives in Delhi,\r\nHamilton county, Ohio, near Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nAs an introduction to his letter, the reader is furnished with the\r\nfollowing testimonial to his character, from the Rev. Horace Bushnell,\r\npastor of the Presbyterian church in Delhi. Mr. B. says:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Leftwich is a worthy member of this church, and is a young man of\r\nsterling integrity and veracity.\r\n\r\nH. BUSHNELL.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the letter of Mr. Leftwich, dated Dec. 26, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Brother--I am not ranked among the abolitionists, yet I cannot,\r\nas a friend of humanity, withhold from the public such facts in\r\nrelation to the condition of the slaves, as have fallen under my own\r\nobservation. That I am somewhat acquainted with slavery will be seen,\r\nas I narrate some incidents of my own life. My parents were\r\nslaveholders, and moved from Virginia to Madison county, Alabama,\r\nduring my infancy. My mother soon fell a victim to the climate. Being\r\nthe youngest of the children, I was left in the care of my aged\r\ngrandfather, who never held a slave, though his sons owned from 90 to\r\n100 during the time I resided with him. As soon as I could carry a\r\nhoe, my uncle, by the name of Neely, persuaded my grandfather that I\r\nshould be placed in his hands, and brought up in habits of industry. I\r\nwas accordingly placed under his tuition. I left the domestic circle,\r\nlittle dreaming of the horrors that awaited me. My mother's own\r\nbrother took me to the cotton field, there to learn habits of\r\nindustry, and to be benefited by his counsels. But the sequel proved,\r\nthat I was there to feel in my own person, and witness by experience\r\nmany of the horrors of slavery. Instead of kind admonition, I was to\r\nendure the frowns of one, whose sympathies could neither be reached by\r\nthe prayers and cries of his slaves, nor by the entreaties and\r\nsufferings of a sister's son. Let those who call slaveholders kind,\r\nhospitable and humane, mark the course the slaveholder pursues with\r\none born free, whose ancestors fought and bled for liberty; and then\r\nsay, if they can without a blush of shame, that he who robs the\r\nhelpless of every _right_, can be truly kind and hospitable.\r\n\r\n\"In a short time after I was put upon the plantation, there was but\r\nlittle difference between me and the slaves, except being _white_, I\r\nate at the master's table. The slaves were my companions in misery,\r\nand I well learned their condition, both in the house and field. Their\r\ndwellings are log huts, from ten to twelve feet square; often without\r\nwindows, doors or floors. They have neither chairs, tables or\r\nbedsteads. These huts are occupied by eight, ten or twelve persons\r\neach. Their bedding generally consists of two old blankets. Many of\r\nthem sleep night after night sitting upon their blocks or stools;\r\nothers sleep in the open air. Our task was appointed, and from dawn\r\ntill dark all must bend to their work. Their meals were taken without\r\nknife or plate, dish or spoon. Their food was corn _pone_, prepared in\r\nthe coarsest manner, with a small allowance of meat. Their meals in\r\nthe field were taken from the hands of the carrier, wherever he found\r\nthem, with no more ceremony than in the feeding of swine. My uncle was\r\nhis own overseer. For punishing in the field, he preferred a large\r\nhickory stick; and wo to him whose work was not done to please him,\r\nfor the hickory was used upon our heads as remorselessly as if we had\r\nbeen mad dogs. I was often the object of his fury, and shall bear the\r\nmarks of it on my body till I die. Such was my suffering and\r\ndegradation, that at the end of five years, I hardly dared to say I\r\nwas _free_. When thinning cotton, we went mostly on our knees. One\r\nday, while thus engaged, my uncle found my row behind; and, by way of\r\nadmonition, gave me a few blows with his hickory, the marks of which I\r\ncarried for weeks. Often I followed the example of the fugitive\r\nslaves, and betook myself to the mountains; but hunger and fear drove\r\nme back, to share with the wretched slave his toil and stripes. But I\r\nhave talked enough about my own bondage; I will now relate a few\r\nfacts, showing the condition of the slaves _generally_.\r\n\r\n\"My uncle wishing to purchase what is called a good 'house wench,' a\r\n_trader_ in human flesh soon produced a woman, recommending her as\r\nhighly as ever a jockey did a horse. She was purchased, but on trial\r\nwas found wanting in the requisite qualifications. She then fell a\r\nvictim to the disappointed rage of my uncle; innocent or guilty, she\r\nsuffered greatly from his fury. He used to tie her to a peach tree in\r\nthe yard, and whip her till there was no sound place to lay another\r\nstroke, and repeat it so often that her back was kept continually\r\nsore. Whipping the females around the legs, was a favorite mode of\r\npunishment with him. They must stand and hold up their clothes, while\r\nhe plied his hickory. He did not, like some of his neighbors, keep a\r\npack of hounds for hunting runaway negroes, but be kept one dog for\r\nthat purpose, and when he came up with a runaway, it would have been\r\ndeath to attempt to fly, and it was nearly so to stand. Sometimes,\r\nwhen my uncle attempted to whip the slaves, the dog would rush upon\r\nthem and relieve them of their rags, if not of their flesh. One object\r\nof my uncle's special hate was \"Jerry,\" a slave of a proud spirit. He\r\ndefied all the curses, rage and stripes of his tyrant. Though he was\r\noften overpowered--for my uncle would frequently wear out his stick\r\nupon his head--yet be would never submit. As he was not expert in\r\npicking cotton, he would sometimes run away in the fall, to escape\r\nabuse. At one time, after an absence of some months, he was arrested\r\nand brought back. As is customary, he was stripped, tied to a log, and\r\nthe cow-skin applied to his naked body till his master was exhausted.\r\nThen a large log chain was fastened around one ankle, passed up his\r\nback, over his shoulders, then across his breast, and fastened under\r\nhis arm. In this condition he was forced to perform his daily task.\r\nAdd to this he was chained each night, and compelled to chop wood\r\nevery Sabbath, to make up lost time. After being thus manacled for\r\nsome months, he was released--but his spirit was unsubdued. Soon\r\nafter, his master, in a paroxysm of rage, fell upon him, wore out his\r\nstaff upon his head, loaded him again with chains, and after a month,\r\nsold him farther south. Another slave, by the name of Mince, who was a\r\nman of great strength, purloined some bacon on a Christmas eve. It was\r\nmissed in the morning, and he being absent, was of course suspected.\r\nOn returning home, my uncle commanded him to come to him, but he\r\nrefused. The master strove in vain to lay hands on him; in vain he\r\nordered his slaves to seize him--they dared not. At length the master\r\nhurled a stone at his head sufficient to have felled a bullock--but he\r\ndid not heed it. At that instant my aunt sprang forward, and\r\npresenting the gun to my uncle, exclaimed, 'Shoot him! shoot him !' He\r\nmade the attempt, but the gun missed fire, and Mince fled. He was\r\ntaken eight or ten months after while crossing the Ohio. When brought\r\nback, the master, and an overseer on another plantation, took him to\r\nthe mountain and punished him to their satisfaction in secret; after\r\nwhich he was loaded with chains and set to his task.\r\n\r\n\"I here spent nearly all my life in the midst of slavery. From being\r\nthe son of a slaveholder, I descended to the condition of a slave, and\r\nfrom that condition I rose (if you please to call it so,) to the\r\nstation of a '_driver_.' I have lived in Alabama, Tennessee, and\r\nKentucky; and I _know_ the condition of the slaves to be that of\r\nunmixed wretchedness and degradation. And on the part of slaveholders,\r\nthere is cruelty _untold_. The labor of the slave is constant toil,\r\nwrung out by fear. Their food is scanty, and taken without comfort.\r\nTheir clothes answer the purposes neither of comfort nor decency. They\r\nare not allowed to read or write. Whether they may worship God or not,\r\ndepends on the will of the master. The young children, until they can\r\nwork, often go naked during the warm weather. I could spend months in\r\ndetailing the sufferings, degradation and cruelty inflicted upon\r\nslaves. But my soul sickens at the remembrance of these things.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MR. LEMUEL SAPINGTON, A NATIVE OF MARYLAND.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapington, is a repentant \"soul driver\" or slave trader, now a\r\ncitizen of Lancaster, Pa. He gives the following testimony in a letter\r\ndated, Jan. 21, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Maryland, afterwards moved to Virginia, where I\r\ncommenced the business of farming and trafficking in slaves. In my\r\nneighborhood the slaves were 'quartered.' The description generally\r\ngiven of negro quarters is correct. The quarters are without floors,\r\nand not sufficient to keep off the inclemency of the weather, they are\r\nuncomfortable both in summer and winter. The food there consists of\r\npotatoes, pork, and corn, which were given to them daily, by weight\r\nand measure. The sexes were huddled together promiscuously. Their\r\nclothing is made by themselves after night, though sometimes assisted\r\nby the old women who are no longer able to do out door work,\r\nconsequently it is harsh and uncomfortable. I have frequently seen\r\nthose of both sexes who have not attained the age of twelve years go\r\nnaked. Their punishments are invariably cruel. For the slightest\r\noffence, such as taking a hen's egg, I have seen them stripped and\r\nsuspended by their hands, their feet tied together, a fence rail of\r\nordinary size placed between their ankles, and then most cruelly\r\nwhipped, until, from head to foot, they were completely lacerated, a\r\npickle made for the purpose of salt and water, would then be applied\r\nby a fellow-slave, for the purpose of healing the wounds as well as\r\ngiving pain. Then taken down and without the least respite sent to\r\nwork with their hoe.\r\n\r\n\"Pursuing my assumed right of driving souls, I went to the Southern\r\npart of Virginia for the purpose of trafficking in slaves. In that\r\npart of the state, the cruelties practised upon the slaves, are far\r\ngreater than where I lived. The punishments there often resulted in\r\ndeath to the slave. There was no law for the negro, but that of the\r\noverseer's whip. In that part of the country, the slaves receive\r\nnothing for food, but corn in the ear, which has to be prepared for\r\nbaking after working hours, by grinding it with a hand-mill. This they\r\ntake to the fields with them, and prepare it for eating, by holding it\r\non their hoes, over a fire made by a stump. Among the gangs, are often\r\nyoung women, who bring their children to the fields, and lay them in a\r\nfence corner, while they are at work, only being permitted to nurse\r\nthem at the option of the overseer. When a child is three weeks old, a\r\nwoman is considered in working order. I have seen a woman, with her\r\nyoung child strapped to her back, laboring the whole day, beside a\r\nman, perhaps the father of the child, and he not being permitted to\r\ngive her any assistance, himself being under the whip. The uncommon\r\nhumanity of the driver allowing her the comfort of doing so. I was\r\nthen selling a drove of slaves, which I had brought by water from\r\nBaltimore, my conscience not allowing me to drive, as was generally\r\nthe case uniting the slaves by collars and chains, and thus driving\r\nthem under the whip. About that time an unaccountable something, which\r\nI now know was an interposition of Providence, prevented me from\r\nprosecuting any farther this unholy traffic; but though I had quitted\r\nit, I still continued to live in a slave state, witnessing every day\r\nits evil effects upon my fellow beings. Among which was a\r\nheart-rending scene that took place in my father's house, which led me\r\nto lease a slave state, as well as all the imaginary comforts arising\r\nfrom slavery. On preparing for my removal to the state of\r\nPennsylvania, it became necessary for me to go to Louisville, in\r\nKentucky, where, if possible, I became more horrified with the\r\nimpositions practiced upon the negro than before. There a slave was\r\nsold to go farther south, and was hand-cuffed for the purpose of\r\nkeeping him secure. But choosing death rather than slavery, he jumped\r\noverboard and was drowned. When I returned four weeks afterwards his\r\nbody, that had floated three miles below, was yet unburied. One fact;\r\nit is impossible for a person to pass through a slave state, if he has\r\neyes open, without beholding every day cruelties repugnant to\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nRespectfully Yours,\r\n\r\nLEMUEL SAPINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. NANCY LOWRY, A NATIVE OF KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lory, is a member of the non-conformist church in Osnaburg, Stark\r\nCounty, Ohio, she is a native of Kentucky. We have received from her\r\nthe following testimony.\r\n\r\n\"I resided in the family of Reuben Long, the principal part of the\r\ntime, from seven to twenty-two years of age. Mr. Long had 16 slaves,\r\namong whom were three who were treated with severity, although Mr.\r\nLong was thought to be a very human master. These three, namely John,\r\nNed, and James, had wives; John and Ned had theirs at some distance,\r\nbut James had his with him. All three died a premature death, and it\r\nwas generally believed by his neighbors, that extreme whipping was the\r\ncause. I believe so too. Ned died about the age of 25 and John 34 or\r\n35. The cause of their flogging was commonly staying a little over the\r\ntime, with their wives. Mr. Long would tie them up by the wrist, so\r\nhigh that their toes would just touch the ground, and then with a\r\ncow-hide lay the lash upon the naked back, until he was exhausted,\r\nwhen he would sit down and rest. As soon as he had rested\r\nsufficiently, he would ply the cow-hide again, thus he would continue\r\nuntil the whole back of the poor victim was lacerated into one uniform\r\ncoat of blood. Yet he was a strict professor of the Christian\r\nreligion, in the southern church. I frequently washed the wounds of\r\nJohn, with salt water, to prevent putrefaction. This was the usual\r\ncourse pursued after a severe flogging; their backs would be full of\r\ngashes, so deep the I could almost lay my finger in them. They were\r\ngenerally laid up after the flogging for several days. The last\r\nflogging Ned got, he was confined to the bed, which he never left till\r\nhe was carried to his grave. During John's confinement in his last\r\nsickness on one occasion while attending on him, he exclaimed, 'oh,\r\nNancy, Miss Nancy, I haven't much longer in this world, I feel as if\r\nmy whole body inside and all my bones were beaten into a jelly.' Soon\r\nafter he died. John and Ned were both professors of religion.\r\n\r\n\"John Ruffner, a slaveholder, had one slave named Pincy, whom he as\r\nwell as Mrs. Ruffner would often flog very severely. I frequently saw\r\nMrs. Ruffner flog her with the broom, shovel, or any thing she could\r\nseize in her rage. She would knock her down and then kick and stamp\r\nher most unmercifully, until she would be apparently so lifeless, that\r\nI more than once thought she would never recover. Often Pincy would\r\ntry to shelter herself from the blows of her mistress, by creeping\r\nunder the bed, from which Mrs. Ruffner would draw her by the feet, and\r\nthen stamp and leap on her body, till her breath would be gone. Often\r\nPincy, would cry, 'Oh Missee, don't kill me!' 'Oh Lord, don't kill\r\nme!' 'For God's sake don't kill me!' But Mrs. Ruffner would beat and\r\nstamp away, with all the venom of a demon. The cause of Pincy's\r\nflogging was, not working enough, or making some mistake in baking,\r\n&c. &c. Many a night Pincy had to lie on the bare floor, by the side\r\nof the cradle, rocking the baby of her mistress, and if she would fall\r\nasleep, and suffer the child to cry, so as to waken Mrs. Ruffner, she\r\nwould be sure to receive a flogging.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MR. WM. C. GILDERSLEEVE, A NATIVE OF GEORGIA\r\n\r\nMR. W.C. GILDERSLEEVE, a native of Georgia, is an elder of the\r\nPresbyterian Church at Wilkesbarre, Pa.\r\n\r\n\"_Acts of cruelty, without number, fell under my observation_ while I\r\nlived in Georgia. I will mention but one. A slave of a Mr. Pinkney, on\r\nhis way with a wagon to Savannah, 'camped' for the night by the road\r\nside. That night, the nearest hen-roost was robbed. On his return, the\r\nhen-roost was again visited, and the fowl counted one less in the\r\nmorning. The oldest son, with some attendants made search, and came\r\nupon the poor fellow, in the act of dressing his spoil. He was too\r\nnimble for them, and made his retreat good into a dense swamp. When\r\nmuch effort to start him from his hiding place had proved\r\nunsuccessful, it was resolved to lay an ambush for him, some distance\r\nahead. The wagon, meantime, was in charge of a lad, who accompanied\r\nthe teamster as an assistant. The little boy lay still till nearly\r\nnight, (in the hope probably that the teamster would return,) when he\r\nstarted with his wagon. After travelling some distance, the lost one\r\nmade his appearance, when the ambush sprang upon him. The poor fellow\r\nwas conducted back to the plantation. He expected little mercy. He\r\nbegged for himself, in the most suplicating manner, 'pray massa give\r\nme 100 lashes and let me go.' He was then tied by the hands, to a limb\r\nof a large mulberry tree, which grew in the yard, so that his feet\r\nwere raised a few inches from the ground, while a _sharpened stick_\r\nwas driven underneath that he might rest his weight on it, or swing by\r\nhis hands. In this condition 100 lashes were laid on his bare body. I\r\nstood by and witnessed the whole, without as I recollect feeling the\r\nleast compassion. So hardening is the influence of slavery, that it\r\nvery much destroys feeling for the slave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MR. HIRAM WHITE--A NATIVE OF NORTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE resided thirty-two years in Chatham county, North Carolina,\r\nand is now a member of the Baptist Church, at Otter Creek Prairie,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nAbout the 20th December 1830, a report was raised that the slaves in\r\nChatham county, North Carolina, were going to rise on Christmas day,\r\nin consequence of which a considerable commotion ensued among the\r\ninhabitants; orders were given by the Governor to the militia\r\ncaptains, to appoint patrolling captains in each district, and orders\r\nwere given for every man subject to military duty to patrol as their\r\ncaptains should direct. I went two nights in succession, and after\r\nthat refused to patrol at all. The reason why I refused was this,\r\norders were given to search every negro house for books or prints of\r\nany kind, and _Bibles_ and _Hymn books_ were particularly mentioned.\r\nAnd should we find any, our orders were to inflict punishment by\r\nwhipping the slave until he _informed who_ gave them to him, or how\r\nthey came by them.\r\n\r\nAs regards the comforts of the slaves in the vicinity of my residence,\r\nI can say they had nothing that would bear that name. It is true, the\r\nslaves in general, of a good crop year, were tolerably well fed, but\r\nof a bad crop year, they were, as a general thing, cut short of their\r\nallowance. Their houses were pole cabins, without loft or floor. Their\r\nbeds were made of what is there called \"broom-straw.\" The men more\r\ncommonly sleep on benches. Their clothing would compare well with\r\ntheir lodging. Whipping was common. It was hardly possible for a man\r\nwith a common pair of ears, if he was out of his house but a short\r\ntime on Monday mornings, to miss of hearing the sound of the lash, and\r\nthe cries of the sufferers pleading with their masters to desist.\r\nThese scenes were more common throughout the time of my residence\r\nthere, from 1799 to 1831.\r\n\r\nMr. Hedding of Chatham county, held a slave woman. I traveled past\r\nHeddings as often as once in two weeks during the winter of 1828, and\r\nalways saw her clad in a single cotton dress, sleeves came half way to\r\nthe elbow, and in order to prevent her running away, a child, supposed\r\nto be about seven years of age, was connected with her by a long chain\r\nfastened round her neck, and in this situation she was compelled all\r\nthe day to grub up the roots of shrubs and sapplings to prepare ground\r\nfor the plough. It is not uncommon for slaves to make up on Sundays\r\nwhat they are not able to perform through the week of their tasks.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the rumored insurrection above named, Chatham jail was\r\nfilled with slaves who were said to have been concerned in the plot.\r\nWithout the least evidence of it, they were punished in divers ways;\r\nsome were whipped, some had their _thumbs screwed in a vice_ to make\r\nthem confess, but no proof satisfactory was ever obtained that the\r\nnegroes had ever thought of an insurrection, nor did any so far as I\r\ncould learn, acknowledge that an insurrection had ever been projected.\r\nFrom this time forth, the slaves were prohibited from assembling\r\ntogether for the worship of God, and many of those who had previously\r\nbeen authorized to preach the gospel were prohibited.\r\n\r\nAmalgamation was common. There was scarce a family of slaves that had\r\nfemales of mature age where there were not some mulatto children.\r\n\r\nHIRAM  WHITE\r\n\r\n_Otter Creek Prairie, Jan. 22, 1839_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MR. JOHN M. NELSON--A NATIVE OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nExtract of a letter, dated January 3, 1839, from John M. Nelson, Esq.,\r\nof Hillsborough. Mr. Nelson removed from Virginia to Highland county,\r\nOhio, many years since, where he is extensively known and respected.\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in Augusta county, Virginia; my father was an\r\nelder in the Presbyterian Church, and was \"owner\" of about twenty\r\nslaves; he was what was generally termed a \"good master.\" His slaves\r\nwere generally tolerably well fed and clothed, and not over worked,\r\nthey were sometimes permitted to attend church, and called in to\r\nfamily worship; few of them, however, availed themselves of these\r\nprivileges. On _some occasions_ I have seen him whip them severely,\r\nparticularly for the crime of trying to obtain their liberty, or for\r\nwhat was called, \"running away.\" For _this_ they were scourged more\r\nseverely than for any thing else. After they have been retaken, I have\r\nseen them stripped naked and suspended by the hands, sometimes to a\r\ntree, sometimes to a post, until their toes barely touched the ground,\r\nand whipped with a cowhide until the blood dripped from their backs. A\r\nboy named Jack, particularly, I have seen served in this way more than\r\nonce. When I was quite a child, I recollect it grieved me very much to\r\nsee one _tied up_ to be whipped, and I used to intercede with tears in\r\ntheir behalf, and mingle my cries with theirs, and feel almost willing\r\nto take part of the punishment; I have been severely rebuked by my\r\nfather for this kind of sympathy. Yet, such is the hardening nature of\r\nsuch scenes, that from this kind of commiseration for the suffering\r\nslave, I became so blunted that I could not only witness their stripes\r\nwith composure, but _myself_ inflict them, and that without remorse.\r\nOne case I have often looked back to with sorrow and contrition,\r\nparticularly since I have been convinced that \"negroes are men.\" When\r\nI was perhaps fourteen or fifteen years of age, I undertook to correct\r\na young fellow named Ned, for some supposed offence; I think it was\r\nleaving a bridle out of its proper place; he being larger and stronger\r\nthan myself took hold of my arms and held me, in order to prevent my\r\nstriking him; this I considered the height of insolence, and cried for\r\nhelp, when my father and mother both came running to my rescue. My\r\nfather stripped and tied him, and took him into the orchard, where\r\nswitches were plenty, and directed me to whip him; when one switch\r\nwore out he supplied me with others. After I had whipped him a while,\r\nhe fell on his knees to implore forgiveness, and I kicked him in the\r\nface; my father said, \"don't kick him, but whip him;\" this I did until\r\nhis back was literally covered with _welts_. I know I have repented,\r\nand trust I have obtained pardon for these things.\r\n\r\nMy father owned a woman, (we used to call aunt Grace,) she was\r\npurchased in Old Virginia. She has told me that her old master, in his\r\n_will_, gave her her freedom, but at his death, his sons had sold her\r\nto my father: when he bought her she manifested some unwillingness to\r\ngo with him, when she was put in irons and taken by force. This was\r\nbefore I was born; but I remember to have seen the irons, and was told\r\nthat was what they had been used for. Aunt Grace is still living, and\r\nmust be between seventy and eighty years of age; she has, for the last\r\nforty years, been an exemplary Christian. When I was a youth I took\r\nsome pains to learn her to read; this is now a great consolation to\r\nher. Since age and infirmity have rendered her of little value to her\r\n\"owners,\" she is permitted to read as much as she pleases; this she\r\ncan do, with the aid of glasses, in the old family Bible, which is\r\nalmost the only book she has ever looked into. This with some little\r\nmending for the black children, is all she does; she is still held as\r\na slave. I well remember what a _heart-rending scene_ there was in the\r\nfamily when _my father sold her husband_; this was, I suppose,\r\nthirty-five years ago. And yet my father was considered one of the\r\nbest of masters. I know of few who were better, but of _many_ who were\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw my father, which was in the fall of 1832, he\r\npromised me that he would free all his slaves at his death. He died\r\nhowever without doing it; and I have understood since, that he omitted\r\nit, through the influence of Rev. Dr. Speece, a Presbyterian minister,\r\nwho lived in the family, and was a _warm friend of the Colonization\r\nSociety_.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1809 or 10, I became a student of Rev. George Bourne;\r\nhe was the first abolitionist I had ever seen, and the first I had\r\never heard pray or plead for the oppressed, which gave me the first\r\nmisgivings about the _innocence_ of slaveholding. I received\r\nimpressions from Mr. Bourne which I could not get rid of,[6] and\r\ndetermined in my own mind that when I settled in life, it should be in\r\na free state; this determination I carried into effect in 1813, when I\r\nremoved to this place, which I supposed at that time, to be all the\r\nopposition to slavery that was necessary, but the moment I became\r\nconvinced that all slaveholding was in itself _sinful_, I became an\r\nabolitionist, which was about four years ago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Mr. Bourne resided seven years in Virginia, \"in perils\r\namong false brethren; fiercely persecuted for his faithful testimony\r\nagainst slavery. More than twenty years since he published a work\r\nentitled 'The Book and Slavery irreconcileable.'\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ANGELINA GRIMKÉ WELD.\r\n\r\nMrs. Weld is the youngest daughter of the late Judge Grimké, of the\r\nSupreme Court of South Carolina, and a sister of the late Hon. Thomas\r\nS. Grimké, of Charleston.\r\n\r\nFort Lee, Bergen Co., New Jersey, Fourth month 6th, 1839.\r\n\r\nI sit down to comply with thy request, preferred in the name of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The\r\nresponsibility laid upon me by such a request, leaves me no option.\r\nWhile I live, and slavery lives, I _must_ testify against it. If I\r\nshould hold my peace, \"the stone would cry out of the wall, and the\r\nbeam out of the timber would answer it.\" But though I feel a necessity\r\nupon me, and \"a woe unto me,\" if I withhold my testimony, I give it\r\nwith a heavy heart. My flesh crieth out, \"if it be possible, let\r\n_this_ cup pass from me;\" but, \"Father, _thy_ will be done,\" is, I\r\ntrust, the breathing of my spirit. Oh, the slain of the daughter of my\r\npeople! they lie in all the ways; their tears fall as the rain, and\r\nare their meat day and night; their blood runneth down like water;\r\ntheir plundered hearths are desolate; they weep for their husbands and\r\nchildren, because they are not; and the proud waves do continually go\r\nover them, while no eye pitieth, and no man careth for their souls.\r\n\r\nBut it is not alone for the sake of my poor brothers and sisters in\r\nbonds, or for the cause of truth, and righteousness, and humanity,\r\nthat I testify; the deep yearnings of affection for the mother that\r\nbore me, who is still a slaveholder, both in fact and in heart; for my\r\nbrothers and sisters, (a large family circle,) and for my numerous\r\nother slaveholding kindred in South Carolina, constrain me to speak:\r\nfor even were slavery no curse to its victims, the exercise of\r\narbitrary power works such fearful ruin upon the hearts of\r\n_slaveholders_, that I should feel impelled to labor and pray for its\r\noverthrow with my last energies and latest breath.\r\n\r\nI think it important to premise, that I have seen almost nothing of\r\nslavery on _plantations_. My testimony will have respect exclusively\r\nto the treatment of \"_house-servants_,\" and chiefly those belonging to\r\nthe first families in the city of Charleston, both in the religious\r\nand in the fashionable world. And here let me say, that the treatment\r\nof _plantation_ slaves cannot be fully known, except by the poor\r\nsufferers themselves, and their drivers and overseers. In a multitude\r\nof instances, even the master can know very little of the actual\r\ncondition of his own field-slaves, and his wife and daughters far\r\nless. A few facts concerning my own family will show this. Our\r\npermanent residence was in Charleston; our country-seat (Bellemont,)\r\nwas 200 miles distant, in the north-western part of the state; where,\r\nfor some years, our family spent a few months annually. Our\r\n_plantation_ was three miles from this family mansion. There, all the\r\nfield-slaves lived and worked. Occasionally, once a month, perhaps,\r\nsome of the family would ride over to the plantation, but I never\r\nvisited the _fields where the slaves were at work_, and knew almost\r\nnothing of their condition; but this I do know, that the overseers who\r\nhad charge of them, were generally unprincipled and intemperate men.\r\nBut I rejoice to know, that the general treatment of slaves in that\r\nregion of country, was far milder than on the plantations in the lower\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThroughout all the eastern and middle portions of the state, the\r\nplanters very rarely reside permanently on their plantations. They\r\nhave almost invariably _two residences_, and spend less than half the\r\nyear on their estates. Even while spending a few months on them,\r\npolitics, field-sports, races, speculations, journeys, visits,\r\ncompany, literary pursuits, &c., absorb so much of their time, that\r\nthey must, to a considerable extent, take the condition of their\r\nslaves _on trust_, from the reports of their overseers. I make this\r\nstatement, because these slaveholders (the wealthier class,) are, I\r\nbelieve, almost the only ones who visit the north with their\r\nfamilies;--and northern opinions of slavery are based chiefly on their\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nBut not to dwell on preliminaries, I wish to record my testimony to\r\nthe faithfulness and accuracy with which my beloved sister, Sarah M.\r\nGrimké, has, in her 'narrative and testimony,' on a preceding page,\r\ndescribed the condition of the slaves, and the effect upon the hearts\r\nof slaveholders, (even the best,) caused by the exercise of unlimited\r\npower over moral agents. Of the _particular acts_ which she has\r\nstated, I have no personal knowledge, as they occurred before my\r\nremembrance; but of the spirit that prompted them, and that constantly\r\ndisplays itself in scenes of similar horror, the recollections of my\r\nchildhood, and the effaceless imprint upon my riper years, with the\r\nbreaking of my heart-strings, when, finding that I was powerless to\r\nshield the victims, I tore myself from my home and friends, and became\r\nan exile among strangers--all these throng around me as witnesses, and\r\ntheir testimony is graven on my memory with a pen of fire.\r\n\r\nWhy I did not become totally hardened, under the daily operation of\r\nthis system, God only knows; in deep solemnity and gratitude, I say,\r\nit was the _Lord's_ doing, and marvellous in mine eyes. Even before my\r\nheart was touched with the love of Christ, I used to say, \"Oh that I\r\nhad the wings of a dove, that I might flee away and be at rest;\" for I\r\nfelt that there could be no rest for me in the midst of such outrages\r\nand pollutions. And yet I saw _nothing_ of slavery in its most vulgar\r\nand repulsive forms. I saw it in the city, among the fashionable and\r\nthe honorable, where it was garnished by refinement, and decked out\r\nfor show. A few _facts_ will unfold the state of society in the circle\r\nwith which I was familiar far better than any general assertions I can\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nI will first introduce the reader to a woman of the highest\r\nrespectability--one who was foremost in every benevolent enterprise,\r\nand stood for many years, I may say, at the _head_ of the fashionable\r\nElite of the city of Charleston, and afterwards at the head of the\r\nmoral and religious female society there. It was after she had made a\r\nprofession of religion, and retired from the fashionable world, that I\r\nknew her; therefore I will present her in her religious character.\r\nThis lady used to keep cowhides, or small paddles, (called 'pancake\r\nsticks,') in four different apartments in her house; so that when she\r\nwished to punish, or to have punished, any of her slaves, she might\r\nnot have the trouble of sending for an instrument of torture. For many\r\nyears, one or other, and _often_ more of her slaves, were flogged\r\n_every day_; particularly the young slaves about the house, whose\r\nfaces were slapped, or their hands beat with the 'pancake stick; for\r\nevery trifling offence--and often for no fault at all. But the\r\nfloggings were not all; the scolding, and abuse daily heaped upon them\r\nall, were worse: 'fools' and 'liars,' 'sluts' and 'husseys,'\r\n'hypocrites' and 'good-for-nothing creatures'; were the common\r\nepithets with which her mouth was filled, when addressing her slaves,\r\nadults as well as children. Very often she would take a position at\r\nher window, in an upper story, and scold at her slaves while working\r\nin the garden, at some distance from the house, (a large yard\r\nintervening,) and occasionally order a flogging. I have known her thus\r\non the watch, scolding for more than an hour at a time, in so loud a\r\nvoice that the whole neighborhood could hear her; and this without the\r\nleast apparent feeling of shame. Indeed, it was no disgrace among\r\nslaveholders, and did not in the least injure her standing, either as\r\na lady or a Christian, in the aristocratic circle in which she moved.\r\nAfter the 'revival' in Charleston, in 1825, she opened her house to\r\nsocial prayer-meetings. The room in which they were held in the\r\nevening, and where the voice of prayer was heard around the family\r\naltar, and where she herself retired for private devotion thrice each\r\nday, was the very place in which, when her slaves were to be whipped\r\nwith the cowhide, they were taken to receive the infliction; and the\r\nwail of the sufferer would be heard, where, perhaps only a few hours\r\nprevious, rose the voices of prayer and praise. This mistress would\r\noccasionally send her slaves, male and female, to the Charleston\r\nwork-house to be punished. One poor girl, whom she sent there to be\r\nflogged, and who was accordingly stripped _naked_ and whipped, showed\r\nme the deep gashes on her back--I might have laid my whole finger in\r\nthem--_large pieces of flesh had actually been cut out by the\r\ntorturing lash_. She sent another female slave there, to be imprisoned\r\nand worked on the tread-mill. This girl was confined several days, and\r\nforced to work the mill while in a state of suffering from another\r\ncause. For ten days or two weeks after her return, she was lame, from\r\nthe violent exertion necessary to enable her to keep the step on the\r\nmachine. She spoke to me with intense feeling of this outrage upon\r\nher, as a _woman_. Her men servants were sometimes flogged there; and\r\nso exceedingly offensive has been the putrid flesh of their lacerated\r\nbacks, for days after the infliction, that they would be kept out of\r\nthe house--the smell arising from their wounds being too horrible to\r\nbe endured. They were always stiff and sore for some days, and not in\r\na condition to be seen by visitors.\r\n\r\nThis professedly Christian woman was a most awful illustration of the\r\nruinous influence of arbitrary power upon the temper--her bursts of\r\npassion upon the heads of her victims were dreaded even by her own\r\nchildren, and very often, all the pleasure of social intercourse\r\naround the domestic board, was destroyed by her ordering the cook into\r\nher presence, and storming at him, when the dinner or breakfast was\r\nnot prepared to her taste, and in the presence of all her children,\r\ncommanding the waiter to slap his face. _Fault-finding_, was with her\r\nthe constant accompaniment of every meal, and banished that peace\r\nwhich should hover around the social board, and smile on every face.\r\nIt was common for her to order brothers to whip their own sisters, and\r\nsisters their own brothers, and yet no woman visited among the poor\r\nmore than she did, or gave more liberally to relieve their wants.\r\nThis may seem perfectly unaccountable to a northerner, but these\r\nseeming contradictions vanish when we consider that over _them_ she\r\npossessed no arbitrary power, they were always presented to her mind\r\nas unfortunate sufferers, towards whom her sympathies most freely\r\nflowed; she was ever ready to wipe the tears from _their_ eyes, and\r\nopen wide her purse for _their_ relief, but the others were her\r\n_vassals_, thrust down by public opinion beneath her feet, to be at\r\nher beck and call, ever ready to serve in all humility, her, whom God\r\nin his providence had set over them--it was their _duty_ to abide in\r\nabject submission, and hers to _compel_ them to do so--_it was thus\r\nthat she reasoned_. Except at family prayers, none were permitted to\r\n_sit_ in her presence, but the seamstresses and waiting maids, and\r\nthey, however delicate might be their circumstances, were forced to\r\nsit upon low stools, without backs, that they might be constantly\r\nreminded of their inferiority. A slave who waited in the house, was\r\nguilty on a particular occasion of going to visit his wife, and kept\r\ndinner waiting a little, (his wife was the slave of a lady who lived\r\nat a little distance.)  When the family sat down to the table, the\r\nmistress began to scold the waiter for the offence--he attempted to\r\nexcuse himself--she ordered him to hold his tongue--he ventured\r\nanother apology; her son then rose from the table in a rage, and beat\r\nthe face and ears of the waiter so dreadfully that the blood gushed\r\nfrom his mouth, and nose, and ears. This mistress was a _professor of\r\nreligion_; her daughter who related the circumstance, was a _fellow\r\nmember_ of the Presbyterian church _with the poor outraged\r\nslave_--instead of feeling indignation at this outrageous abuse of her\r\nbrother in the church, she justified the deed, and said \"he got just\r\nwhat he deserved.\"  I solemnly believe this to be a true picture of\r\n_slaveholding religion_.\r\n\r\nThe following is another illustration of it:\r\n\r\nA mistress in Charleston sent a grey headed female slave to the\r\nworkhouse, and had her severely flogged. The poor old woman went to\r\nan acquaintance of mine and begged her to buy her, and told her how\r\ncruelly she had been whipped. My friend examined her _lacerated back_,\r\nand out of compassion did purchase her. The circumstance was\r\nmentioned to one of the former owner's relatives, who asked her if it\r\nwere true. The mistress told her it was, and said that she had made\r\nthe severe whipping of this aged woman a _subject of prayer_, and that\r\nshe believed she had done right to have it inflicted upon her. The\r\nlast 'owner' of the poor old slave, said she, had no fault to find\r\nwith her as a servant.\r\n\r\nI remember very well that when I was a child, our next door neighbor\r\nwhipped a young woman so brutally, that in order to escape his blows\r\nshe rushed through the drawing-room window in the second story, and\r\nfell upon the street pavement below and broke her hip. This\r\ncircumstance produced no excitement or inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe following circumstance occurred in Charleston, in 1828:\r\n\r\nA slaveholder, after flogging a little girl about thirteen years old,\r\nset her on a table with her feet fastened in a pair of stocks. He then\r\nlocked the door and took out the key. When the door was opened she\r\nwas found dead, having fallen from the table. When I asked a\r\nprominent lawyer, who belonged to one of the first families in the\r\nState, whether the murderer of this helpless child could not be\r\nindicted, he coolly replied, that the slave was Mr. ----'s property,\r\nand if he chose to suffer the _loss_, no one else had any thing to do\r\nwith it. The loss of _human life_, the distress of the parents and\r\nother relatives of the little girl, seemed utterly out of his\r\nthoughts: it was the loss of _property_ only that presented itself to\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nI knew a gentleman of great benevolence and generosity of character,\r\nso essentially to injure the eye of a little boy, about ten years old,\r\nas to destroy its sight, by the blow of a cowhide, inflicted whilst he\r\nwas whipping him.[7]  I have heard the same individual speak of\r\n\"breaking down the spirit of a slave under the lash\" as perfectly\r\nright.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The Jewish law would have set this servant free, for his\r\neye's sake, but he was held in slavery and sold from hand to hand,\r\nalthough, besides this title to his liberty according to Jewish law,\r\nhe was a _mulatto_, and therefore free under the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, in whose preamble our fathers declare that they\r\nestablished it expressly to \"secure the blessings of _liberty_ to\r\nthemselves and _their posterity_.\"--Ed.]\r\n\r\nI also know that an aged slave of his, (by marriage,) was allowed to\r\nget a scanty and precarious subsistence, by begging in the streets of\r\nCharleston--he was too old to work, and therefore _his allowance was\r\nstopped_, and he was turned out to make his living by begging.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about thirteen years old, I attended a seminary, in\r\nCharleston, which was superintended by a man and his wife of superior\r\neducation. They had under their instruction the daughters of nearly\r\nall the aristocracy. Their cruelty to their slaves, both male and\r\nfemale, I can never forget. I remember one day there was called into\r\nthe school room to open a window, a boy whose head had been shaved in\r\norder to disgrace him, and he had been so dreadfully whipped that he\r\ncould hardly walk. So horrible was the impression produced upon my\r\nmind by his heart-broken countenance and crippled person that I\r\nfainted away. The sad and ghastly countenance of one of their female\r\nmulatto slaves who used to sit on a low stool at her sewing in the\r\npiazza, is now fresh before me. She often told me, secretly, how\r\ncruelly she was whipped when they sent her to the work house. I had\r\nknown so much of the terrible scourgings inflicted in that house of\r\nblood, that when I was once obliged to pass it, the very sight smote\r\nme with such horror that my limbs could hardly sustain me. I felt as\r\nif I was passing the precincts of hell. A friend of mine who lived in\r\nthe neighborhood, told me she often heard the screams of the slaves\r\nunder their torture.\r\n\r\nI once heard a physician of a high family, and of great respectability\r\nin his profession, say, that when he sent his slaves to the work-house\r\nto be flogged, he always went to see it done, that he might be sure\r\nthey were properly, i.e. _severely_ whipped. He also related the\r\nfollowing circumstance in my presence. He had sent a youth of about\r\neighteen to this horrible place to be whipped and _afterwards_ to be\r\nworked upon the treadmill. From not keeping the step, which probably\r\nhe COULD NOT do, in consequence of the lacerated state of his body;\r\nhis arm got terribly torn, from the shoulder to the wrist. This\r\nphysician said, he went every day to attend to it himself, in order\r\nthat he might use those restoratives, which _would inflict the\r\ngreatest possible pain_. This poor boy, after being imprisoned there\r\nfor some weeks, was then brought home, and compelled to wear iron\r\nclogs on his ankles for one or two months. I saw him with those irons\r\non one day when I was at the house. This man was, when young,\r\nremarkable in the fashionable world for his elegant and fascinating\r\nmanners, but the exercise of the slaveholder's power has thrown the\r\nfierce air of tyranny even over these.\r\n\r\nI heard another man of equally high standing say, that he believed he\r\nsuffered far more than his waiter did whenever he flogged him for he\r\nfelt the _exertion_ for days afterward, but he could not let his\r\nservant go on in the neglect of his business, it was _his duty_ to\r\nchastise him. \"His duty\" to flog this boy of seventeen so severely\r\nthat he felt _the exertion_ for days after! and yet he never felt it\r\nto be his duty to instruct him, or have him instructed, even in the\r\ncommon principles of morality. I heard the mother of this man say it\r\nwould be no surprise to her, if he killed a slave some day, for, that,\r\nwhen transported with passion he did not seem to care what he did. He\r\nonce broke a _large_ stick over the back of a slave and at another\r\ntime the ivory butt-end of a long coach whip over the _head_ of\r\nanother. This last was attacked with epileptic fits some months after,\r\nand has ever since been subject to them, and occasionally to violent\r\nfits of insanity.\r\n\r\nSouthern mistresses sometimes flog their slaves themselves though\r\ngenerally one slave is compelled to flog another. Whilst staying at a\r\nfriend's house some years ago, I one day saw the mistress with a\r\ncow-hide in her hand, and heard her scolding in an under tone, her\r\nwaiting man, who was about twenty-five years old. Whether she actually\r\ninflicted the blows I do not know, for I hastened out of sight and\r\nhearing. It was not the first time I had seen a mistress thus engaged.\r\nI knew she was a cruel mistress, and had heard her daughters\r\ndisputing, whether their mother did right or wrong, to send the slave\r\n_children_, (whom she sent out to sweep chimneys) to the work house to\r\nbe whipped if they did not bring in their wages regularly. This woman\r\nmoved in the most fashionable circle in Charleston. The income of this\r\nfamily was derived mostly from the hire of their slaves, about one\r\nhundred in number. Their luxuries were blood-bought luxuries indeed.\r\nAnd yet what stranger would ever have inferred their cruelties from\r\nthe courteous reception and bland manners of the parlor. Every thing\r\ncruel and revolting is carefully concealed from strangers, especially\r\nthose from the north. Take an instance. I have known the master and\r\nmistress of a family send to their friends to _borrow_ servants to\r\nwait on company, because their own slaves had been so cruelly flogged\r\nin the work house, that they could not walk without limping at every\r\nstep, and their putrified flesh emitted such an intolerable smell that\r\nthey were not fit to be in the presence of company. How can\r\nnortherners know these things when they are hospitably received at\r\nsouthern tables and firesides? I repeat it, no one who has not been an\r\n_integral part_ of a slaveholding community, can have any idea of its\r\nabominations. It is a whited sepulchre full of dead men's bones and\r\nall uncleanness. Blessed be God, the Angel of _Truth_ has descended\r\nand rolled away the stone from the mouth of the sepulchre, and sits\r\nupon it. The abominations so long hidden are now brought forth before\r\nall Israel and the sun. Yes, the Angel of Truth _sits upon this\r\nstone_, and it can never be rolled back again.\r\n\r\nThe utter disregard of the comfort of the slaves, in _little_ things,\r\ncan scarcely be conceived by those who have not been a _component\r\npart_ of slaveholding communities. Take a few particulars out of\r\nhundreds that might be named. In South Carolina musketoes swarm in\r\nmyriads, more than half the year--they are so excessively annoying at\r\nnight, that no family thinks of sleeping without nets or\r\n\"musketoe-bars\" hung over their bedsteads, yet slaves are never\r\nprovided with them, unless it be the favorite old domestics who get\r\nthe cast-off pavilions; and yet these very masters and mistresses will\r\nbe so kind to their _horses_ as to provide them with _fly nets_.\r\nBedsteads and bedding too, are rarely provided for any of the\r\nslaves--if the waiters and coachmen, waiting maids, cooks, washers,\r\n&c., have beds at all, they must generally get them for themselves.\r\nCommonly they lie down at night on the bare floor, with a small\r\nblanket wrapped round them in winter, and in summer a coarse osnaburg\r\nsheet, or nothing. Old slaves generally have beds, but it is because\r\nwhen younger _they have provided them for themselves._\r\n\r\nOnly two meals a day are allowed the house slaves--the _first at\r\ntwelve o'clock_. If they eat before this time, it is by stealth, and I\r\nam sure there must be a good deal of suffering among them from\r\n_hunger_, and particularly by children. Besides this, they are often\r\nkept from their meals by way of punishment. No table is provided for\r\nthem to eat from. They know nothing of the comfort and pleasure of\r\ngathering round the social board--each takes his plate or tin pan and\r\niron spoon and holds it in the hand or on the lap. I _never_ saw\r\nslaves seated round a _table_ to partake of any meal.\r\n\r\nAs the general rule, no lights of any kind, no firewood--no towels,\r\nbasins, or soap, no tables, chairs, or other furniture, are provided.\r\nWood for cooking and washing _for the family_ is found, but when the\r\nmaster's work is done, the slave must find wood for himself if he has\r\na fire. I have repeatedly known slave children kept the whole winter's\r\nevening, sitting on the stair-case in a cold entry, just to be at hand\r\nto snuff candles or hand a tumbler of water from the side-board, or go\r\non errands from one room to another. It may be asked why they were not\r\npermitted to stay in the parlor, when they would be still more at\r\nhand. I answer, because waiters are not allowed to _sit_ in the\r\npresence of their owners, and as children who were kept running all\r\nday, would of course get very tired of standing for two or three\r\nhours, they were allowed to go into the entry and sit on the staircase\r\nuntil rung for. Another reason is, that even slaveholders at times\r\nfind the presence of slaves very annoying; they cannot exercise entire\r\nfreedom of speech before them on all subjects.\r\n\r\nI have also known instances where seamstresses were kept in cold\r\nentries to work by the stair case lamps for one or two hours, every\r\nevening in winter--they could not see without standing up all the\r\ntime, though the work was often too large and heavy for them to sew\r\nupon it in that position without great inconvenience, and yet they\r\nwere expected to do their work as _well_ with their cold fingers, and\r\nstanding up, as if they had been sitting by a comfortable fire and\r\nprovided with the necessary light. House slaves suffer a great deal\r\nalso from not being allowed to leave the house without permission. If\r\nthey wish to go even for a draught of water, they must _ask leave_,\r\nand if they stay longer than the mistress thinks necessary, they are\r\nliable to be punished, and often are scolded or slapped, or kept from\r\ngoing down to the next meal.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that relatives, among slaves, are separated for\r\nweeks or months, by the husband or brother being taken by the master\r\non a journey, to attend on his horses and himself.--When they return,\r\nthe white husband seeks the wife of his love; but the black husband\r\nmust wait to see _his_ wife, until mistress pleases to let her\r\nchambermaid leave her room. Yes, such is the despotism of slavery,\r\nthat wives and sisters dare not run to meet their husbands and\r\nbrothers after such separations, and hours sometimes elapse before\r\nthey are allowed to meet; and, at times, a fiendish pleasure is taken\r\nin keeping them asunder--this furnishes an opportunity to vent\r\nfeelings of spite for any little neglect of \"duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe sufferings to which slaves are subjected by separations of various\r\nkinds, cannot be imagined by those unacquainted with the working out\r\nof the system behind the curtain. Take the following instances.\r\n\r\nChambermaids and seamstresses often sleep in their mistresses'\r\napartments, but with no bedding at all. I know an instance of a woman\r\nwho has been married eleven years, and yet has never been allowed to\r\nsleep out of her mistress's chamber.--This is a _great_ hardship to\r\nslaves. When we consider that house slaves are rarely allowed social\r\nintercourse during _the day_, as their work generally _separates_\r\nthem; the barbarity of such an arrangement is obvious. It is\r\npeculiarly a hardship in the above case, as the husband of the woman\r\ndoes not \"belong\" to her \"owner;\" and because he is subject to\r\ndreadful attacks of illness, and can have but little attention from\r\nhis wife in the _day_. And yet her mistress, who is an old lady, gives\r\nher the highest character as a faithful servant, and told a friend of\r\nmine, that she was \"entirely dependent upon her for _all_ her\r\ncomforts; she dressed and undressed her, gave her all her food, and\r\nwas so _necessary_ to her that she could not do without her.\" I may\r\nadd, that this couple are tenderly attached to each other.\r\n\r\nI also know an instance in which the husband was a slave and the wife\r\nwas free: during the illness of the former, the latter was _allowed_\r\nto come and nurse him; she was obliged to leave the work by which she\r\nhad made a living, and come to stay with her husband, and thus lost\r\nweeks of her time, or he would have suffered for want of proper\r\nattention; and yet his \"owner\" made her no compensation for her\r\nservices. He had long been a faithful and a favorite slave, and his\r\nowner was a woman very benevolent to the poor whites.--She went a\r\ngreat deal among these, as a visiting commissioner of the Ladies'\r\nBenevolent Society, and was in the constant habit of _paying the\r\nrelatives of the poor whites_ for nursing _their_ husbands, fathers,\r\nand other relations; because she thought it very hard, when their time\r\nwas taken up, so that they could not earn their daily bread, that they\r\nshould be left to suffer. Now, such is the stupifying influence of the\r\n\"_chattel_ principle\" on the minds of slaveholders, that I do not\r\nsuppose it ever occurred to her that this poor _colored_ wife ought to\r\nbe paid for her services, and particularly as she was spending her\r\ntime and strength in taking care of her \"_property_.\" She no doubt\r\nonly thought how kind she was, to _allow_ her to come and stay so long\r\nin her yard; for, let it be kept in mind, that slaveholders have\r\nunlimited power to separate husbands and wives, parents and children,\r\nhowever and whenever they please; and if this mistress had chosen to\r\ndo it, she could have debarred this woman from all intercourse with\r\nher husband, by forbidding her to enter her premises.\r\n\r\nPersons who own plantations and yet live in cities, often take\r\nchildren from their parents as soon as they are weaned, and send them\r\ninto the country; because they do not want the time of the mother\r\ntaken up by attendance upon her own children, it being too valuable to\r\nthe mistress. As a _favor_, she is, in some cases, permitted to go to\r\nsee them once a year. So, on the other hand, if field slaves happen to\r\nhave children of an age suitable to the convenience of the master,\r\nthey are taken from their parents and brought to the city. Parents are\r\nalmost never consulted as to the disposition to be made of their\r\nchildren; they have as little control over them, as have domestic\r\nanimals over the disposal of their young. Every natural and social\r\nfeeling and affection are violated with indifference; slaves are\r\ntreated as though they did not possess them.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which the feelings of slaves are trifled with and often\r\ndeeply wounded, is by changing their names; if, at the time they are\r\nbrought into a family, there is another slave of the same name; or if\r\nthe owner happens, for some other reason, not to like the name of the\r\nnew comer. I have known slaves very much grieved at having the names\r\nof their children thus changed, when they had been called after a dear\r\nrelation. Indeed it would be utterly impossible to recount the\r\nmultitude of ways in which the _heart_ of the slave is continually\r\nlacerated by the total disregard of his feelings as a social being and\r\na human creature.\r\n\r\nThe slave suffers also greatly from being continually watched. The\r\nsystem of espionage which is constantly kept up over slaves is the\r\nmost worrying and intolerable that can be imagined. Many mistresses\r\nare, in fact, during the absence of their husbands, really their\r\ndrivers; and the pleasure of returning to their families often, on the\r\npart of the husband, is entirely destroyed by the complaints preferred\r\nagainst the slaves when he comes home to his meals.\r\n\r\nA mistress of my acquaintance asked her servant boy, one day, what was\r\nthe reason she could not get him to do his work whilst his master was\r\naway, and said to him, \"Your master works a great deal harder than you\r\ndo; he is at his office all day, and often has to study his law cases\r\nat night.\" \"Master,\" said the boy, \"is working for himself, and for\r\nyou, ma'am, but I am working for _him_\". The mistress turned and\r\nremarked to a friend, that she was so struck with the truth of the\r\nremark, that she could not say a word to him. But I forbear--the\r\nsufferings of the slaves are not only innumerable, but they are\r\n_indescribable_. I may paint the agony of kindred torn from each\r\nother's arms, to meet no more in time; I may depict the inflictions of\r\nthe blood-stained lash, but I cannot describe the daily, hourly,\r\nceaseless torture, endured by the heart that is constantly trampled\r\nunder the foot of despotic power. This is a part of the horrors of\r\nslavery which, I believe, no one has ever attempted to delineate; I\r\nwonder not at it, it mocks all power of language. Who can describe the\r\nanguish of that mind which feels itself impaled upon the iron of\r\narbitrary power--its living, writhing, helpless victim! every human\r\nsusceptibility tortured, its sympathies torn, and stung, and\r\nbleeding--always feeling the death-weapon in its heart, and yet not so\r\ndeep as to _kill_ that humanity which is made the curse of Its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my testimony I have entered somewhat into the\r\n_minutiae_ of slavery, because this is a part of the subject often\r\noverlooked, and cannot be appreciated by any but those who have been\r\nwitnesses, and entered into sympathy with the slaves as human beings.\r\nSlaveholders think nothing of them, because they regard their slaves\r\nas _property_, the mere instruments of their convenience and pleasure.\r\n_One who is a slaveholder at heart never recognises a human being in a\r\nslave_.\r\n\r\nAs thou hast asked me to testify respecting the _physical condition_\r\nof the slaves merely, I say nothing of the awful neglect of their\r\n_minds and souls_ and the systematic effort to imbrute them. A wrong\r\nand an impiety, in comparison with which all the other unutterable\r\nwrongs of slavery are but as the dust of the balance.\r\n\r\nANGELINA G. WELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL TESTIMONY\r\n\r\nTO THE CRUELTIES INFLICTED UPON SLAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore presenting to the reader particular details of the cruelties\r\ninflicted upon American slaves, we will present in brief the\r\nwell-weighed declarations of slaveholders and other residents of slave\r\nstates, testifying that the slaves are treated with barbarous\r\ninhumanity. All _details_ and particulars will be drawn out under\r\ntheir appropriate heads. We propose in this place to present testimony\r\nof a _general character_--the solemn declarations of slaveholders and\r\nothers, that the slaves are treated with great cruelty.\r\n\r\nTo discredit the testimony of witnesses who insist upon convicting\r\nthemselves, would be an anomalous scepticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo show that American slavery has _always_ had one uniform character\r\nof diabolical cruelty, we will go back one hundred years, and prove it\r\nby unimpeachable witnesses, who have given their deliberate testimony\r\nto its horrid barbarity, from 1739 to 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF REV. GEORGE WHITEFIELD.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by him in Georgia, and addressed to the\r\nslaveholders of Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, in 1739.--See Benezet's \"Caution to Great Britain and her\r\nColonies.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I lately passed through your provinces on my way hither, I was\r\nsensibly touched with a fellow-feeling of the miseries of the poor\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\n\"Sure I am, it is sinful to use them as bad, nay worse than if they\r\nwere brutes; and whatever particular _exceptions_ there may be, (as I\r\nwould charitably hope there are _some_,) I fear the _generality_ of\r\nyou that own negroes _are liable to such a charge_. Not to mention\r\nwhat numbers have been given up to the inhuman usage of cruel\r\n_taskmasters_, who by their unrelenting scourges, have ploughed their\r\nbacks and made long furrows, and at length brought them to the grave!\r\n\r\n\"_The blood of them, spilt for these many years, in your respective\r\nprovinces, will ascend up to heaven against you!_\" The following is\r\nthe testimony of the celebrated JOHN WOOLMAN, an eminent minister of\r\nthe Society of Friends, who traveled extensively in the slave state.\r\nWe copy it from a \"Memoir of JOHN WOOLMAN, chiefly extracted from a\r\nJournal of his Life and Travels.\" It was published in Philadelphia, by\r\nthe \"Society of Friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"The following reflections, were written in 1757, while he was\r\ntraveling on a religious account among slaveholders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many of the white people in these provinces, take little or no care\r\nof negro marriages; and when negroes marry, after their own way, some\r\nmake so little account of those marriages, that, with views of outward\r\ninterest, they often part men from their wives, by selling them far\r\nasunder; which is common when estates are sold by executors at vendue.\r\n\r\n\"Many whose labor is heavy, being followed at their business in the\r\nfield by a man with a whip, hired for that purpose,--have, in common,\r\nlittle else allowed them but _one peck_ of Indian corn and some salt\r\nfor one week, with a few potatoes. (The potatoes they commonly raise\r\nby their labor on the first day of the week.) The correction ensuing\r\non their disobedience to overseers, or slothfulness in business, is\r\noften _very severe_, and sometimes _desperate_. Men and women have\r\nmany times _scarce clothes enough to hide their nakedness_--and boys\r\nand girls, ten and twelve years old, are often _quite naked_ among\r\ntheir masters' children.

But many individuals\r\nsuffer still more severely. _Many, many are knocked down; some have\r\ntheir eyes beaten out: some have an arm or a leg broken, or chopped\r\noff_; and many, for a very small, or for no crime at all, have been\r\nbeaten to death, merely to gratify the fury of an enraged master or\r\noverseer.\"\r\n\r\nExtract from an oration, delivered at Baltimore, July 4, 1797, by\r\nGEORGE BUCHANAN, M.D., member of the American Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\nTheir situation (the slaves') is _insupportable_; misery inhabits\r\ntheir cabins, and pursues them in the field.

JOHN RANDOLPH, OF ROANOKE--A SLAVEHOLDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of his Congressional speeches, Mr. R. says: \"Avarice alone can\r\ndrive, as it does drive, this _infernal_ traffic, and the wretched\r\nvictims of it, like so many post-horses _whipped to death_ in a mail\r\ncoach.

THOMAS, _Speaker of the House of Representatives._\r\n\r\nPIERRE MINARD, _President pro tem. of the Legislative Council.\r\nVincennes, Dec._ 20, 1806.\r\n\r\n\"Forwarded to the Speaker the United States' Senate, by WILLIAM HENRY\r\nHARRISON, Governor\"--_American State Papers_ vol 1. p. 467.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR C.C. ROBIN, who resided in Louisiana from 1802 to 1806, and\r\npublished a volume containing the results of his observations there,\r\nthus speaks of the condition of the slaves:\r\n\r\n\"While they are at labor, the manager, the master, or the driver has\r\ncommonly the whip in hand to strike the idle. But those of the negroes\r\nwho are judged guilty of serious faults, are punished twenty,\r\ntwenty-five, forty, fifty, or one hundred lashes. The manner of this\r\ncruel execution is as follows: four stakes are driven down, making a\r\nlong square; the culprit is extended naked between these stakes, face\r\ndownwards; his hands and his feet are bound separately, with strong\r\ncords, to each of the stakes, so far apart that his arms and legs,\r\nstretched in the form of St. Andrew's cross, give the poor wretch no\r\nchance of stirring. Then the executioner, who is ordinarily a negro,\r\narmed with the long whip of a coachman, strikes upon the reins and\r\nthighs. The crack of his whip resounds afar, like that of an angry\r\ncartman beating his horses. The blood flows, the long wounds cross\r\neach other, strips of skin are raised without softening either the\r\nhand of the executioner or the heart of the master, who cries 'sting\r\nhim harder.'\r\n\r\n\"The reader is moved; so am I: my agitated hand refuses to trace the\r\nbloody picture, to recount how many times the piercing cry of pain has\r\ninterrupted my silent occupations; how many times I have shuddered at\r\nthe faces of those barbarous masters, where I saw inscribed the number\r\nof victims sacrificed to their ferocity.\r\n\r\n\"The women are subjected to these punishments as rigorously as the\r\nmen--not even pregnancy exempts them; in that case, before binding\r\nthem to the stakes, a hole is made in the ground to accommodate the\r\nenlarged form of the victim.\r\n\r\n\"It is remarkable that the white creole women are ordinarily more\r\ninexorable than the men. Their slow and languid gait, and the trifling\r\nservices which they impose, betoken only apathetic indolence; but\r\nshould the slave not promptly obey, should he even fail to divine the\r\nmeaning of their gestures, or looks, in an instant they are armed with\r\na formidable whip; it is no longer the arm which cannot sustain the\r\nweight of a shawl or a reticule--it is no longer the form which but\r\nfeebly sustains itself. They themselves order the punishment of one of\r\nthese poor creatures, and with a dry eye see their victim bound to\r\nfour stakes; they count the blows, and raise a voice of menace, if the\r\narm that strikes relaxes, or if the blood does not flow in sufficient\r\nabundance. Their sensibility changed to fury must needs feed itself\r\nfor a while on the hideous spectacle; they must, as if to revive\r\nthemselves, hear the piercing shrieks, and see the flow of fresh\r\nblood; there are some of them who, in their frantic rage, pinch and\r\nbite their victims.\r\n\r\n\"It is by no means wonderful that the laws designed to protect the\r\nslave, should be little respected by the generality of such masters. I\r\nhave seen some masters pay those unfortunate people the miserable\r\novercoat which is their due; but others give them nothing at all, and\r\ndo not even leave them the hours and Sundays granted to them by law. I\r\nhave seen some of those barbarous masters leave them, during the\r\nwinter, in a state of revolting nudity, even contrary to their own\r\ntrue interests, for they thus weaken and shorten the lives upon which\r\nrepose the whole of their own fortunes. I have seen some of those\r\nnegroes obliged to conceal their nakedness with the long moss of the\r\ncountry. The sad melancholy of these wretches, depicted upon their\r\ncountenances, the flight of some, and the death of others, do not\r\nreclaim their masters; they wreak upon those who remain, the vengeance\r\nwhich they can no longer exercise upon the others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITMAN MEAD, Esq. of New York, in his journal, published nearly a\r\nquarter of a century ago, under date of\r\n\r\n\"SAVANNAH, January 28, 1817.\r\n\r\n\"To one not accustomed to such scenes as slavery presents, the\r\ncondition of the slaves is _impressively shocking._ In the course of\r\nmy walks, I was every where witness to their wretchedness. Like the\r\nbrute creatures of the north, they are driven about at the pleasure of\r\nall who meet them: _half naked and half starved_, they drag out a\r\npitiful existence, apparently almost unconscious of what they suffer.\r\nA threat accompanies every command, and a bastinado is the usual\r\nreward of disobedience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF REV. JOHN RANKIN,\r\n\r\n_A native of Tennessee, educated there, and for a number of years a\r\npreacher in slave states--now pastor of a church in Ripley, Ohio._\r\n\r\n\"Many poor slaves are stripped naked, stretched and tied across\r\nbarrels, or large bags, _and tortured with the lash during hours, and\r\neven whole days, until their flesh is mangled to the very bones_.\r\nOthers are stripped and hung up by the arms, their feet are tied\r\ntogether, and the end of a heavy piece of timber is put between their\r\nlegs in order to stretch their bodies, and so prepare them for the\r\ntorturing lash--and in this situation they are often whipped until\r\ntheir bodies are covered _with blood and mangled flesh_--and in order\r\nto add the greatest keenness to their sufferings, their wounds are\r\nwashed with _liquid salt_! And some of the miserable creatures are\r\npermitted to hang in that position until they actually _expire_; some\r\ndie under the lash, others linger about for a time, and at length die\r\nof their wounds, and many survive, and endure again similar torture.\r\nThese bloody scenes are _constantly exhibiting in every slave holding\r\ncountry--thousands of whips are every day stained in African blood_!\r\nEven the poor _females_ are not permitted to escape these shocking\r\ncruelties.\"--_Rankin's Letters._\r\n\r\nThese letters were published fifteen years ago.--They were addressed\r\nto a brother in Virginia, who was a slaveholder.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THE AMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\"We have heard of slavery as it exists in Asia, and Africa, and\r\nTurkey--we have heard of the feudal slavery under which the peasantry\r\nof Europe have groaned from the days of Alaric until now, but\r\nexcepting only the horrible system of the West India Islands, we have\r\nnever heard of slavery in any country, ancient or modern, Pagan,\r\nMohammedan, or _Christian! so terrible in its character_, as the\r\nslavery which exists in these United States.\"--_Seventh Report\r\nAmerican Colonization Society,_ 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF THE GRADUAL EMANCIPATION SOCIETY OF NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Signed by Moses Swain, President, and William Swain, Secretary._\r\n\r\n\"In the eastern part of the state, the slaves considerably outnumber\r\nthe free population.

Their _number_ and _atrocity_ are such,\r\nthat I am confident they would gain credit with none but\r\n_abolitionists_. Every thing will be conveyed in the remark, that in a\r\nstate of society calculated to foster the worst passions of our\r\nnature, the slave derives _no protection_ either from _law_ or _public\r\nopinion_, and that ALL the cruelties which the Russians are reported\r\nto have acted towards the Poles, after their late subjugation, ARE\r\nSCENES OF EVERY-DAY OCCURRENCE in the southern states. This statement,\r\nincredible as it may seem, falls short, very far short of the truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is extracted from a letter written by Dr. Finley to Rev.\r\nAsa Mahan, his former pastor, then of Cincinnati, now President of\r\nOberlin Seminary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF REV.

They are the mere _samples_ of\r\nhundreds of similar ones published during the same period, with which,\r\nas the preceding are quite sufficient to show the _commonness_ of\r\ninhuman floggings in the slave states, we need not burden the reader.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing testimony is, as the reader perceives, that of the\r\nslaveholders themselves, voluntarily certifying to the outrages which\r\ntheir own hands have committed upon defenceless and innocent men and\r\nwomen, over whom they have assumed authority. We have given to _their_\r\ntestimony precedence over that of all other witnesses, for the reason\r\nthat when men testify against _themselves_ they are under no\r\ntemptation to exaggerate.\r\n\r\nWe will now present the testimony of a large number of individuals,\r\nwith their names and residences,--persons who witnessed the\r\ninflictions to which they testify. Many of them have been\r\nslaveholders, and _all_ residents for longer or shorter periods in\r\nslave states.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. JOHN H. CURTISS, a native of Deep Creek, Norfolk county,\r\nVirginia, now a local preacher of the Methodist Episcopal Church in\r\nPortage co., Ohio, testifies as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In 1829 or 30, one of my father's slaves was accused of taking the\r\nkey to the office and stealing four or five dollars: he denied it. A\r\nconstable by the name of Hull was called; he took the Negro, very\r\ndeliberately tied his hands, and whipped him till the blood ran freely\r\ndown his legs. By this time Hull appeared tired, and stopped; he then\r\ntook a rope, put a slip noose around his neck, and told the negro he\r\nwas going to _kill_ him, at the same time drew the rope and began\r\nwhipping: the Negro fell; his cheeks looked as though they would burst\r\nwith strangulation. Hull whipped and kicked him, till I really thought\r\nhe was going to kill him; when he ceased, the negro was in a complete\r\ngore of blood from head to foot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. DAVID HAWLEY, a class-leader in the Methodist Church, at St.\r\nAlban's, Licking county, Ohio, who moved from Kentucky to Ohio in\r\n1831, testifies as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1821 or 2, I saw a slave hung for killing his master. The\r\nmaster had whipped the slave's mother to DEATH, and, locking him in a\r\nroom, threatened him with the same fate; and, cowhide in hand, had\r\nbegun the work, when the slave joined battle and slew the master.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ELLISON, a member of the Society of Friends, formerly of\r\nSouthampton county, Virginia, now of Marlborough, Stark county, Ohio,\r\ngives the following testimony:--\r\n\r\n\"While a resident of Southampton county, Virginia, I knew two men,\r\nafter having been severely treated, endeavor to make their escape. In\r\nthis they failed--were taken, tied to trees, and whipped to _death_ by\r\ntheir overseer. I lived a mile from the negro quarters, and, at that\r\ndistance, could frequently hear the screams of the poor creatures when\r\nbeaten, and could also hear the blows given by the overseer with some\r\nheavy instrument.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor HORACE NYE, of Putnam, Ohio, gives the following testimony of\r\nMr. Wm. Armstrong, of that place, a captain and supercargo of boats\r\ndescending the Mississippi river:--\r\n\r\n\"At Bayou Sarah, I saw a slave _staked out,_ with his face to the\r\nground, and whipped with a large whip, which laid open the flesh for\r\nabout two and a half inches _every stroke._ I stayed about five\r\nminutes, but could stand it no longer, and left them whipping.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. STEPHEN E. MALTBY, inspector of provisions, Skeneateles, New York,\r\nwho has resided in Alabama, speaking of the condition of the slaves,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"I have seen them cruelly whipped. I will relate one instance. One\r\nSabbath morning, before I got out of my bed, I heard an outcry, and\r\ngot up and went to the window, when I saw some six or eight boys, from\r\neight to twelve years of age, near a rack (made for tying horses) on\r\nthe public square. A man on horseback rode up, got off his horse, took\r\na cord from his pocket, _tied one of the boys_ by the _thumbs_ to the\r\nrack, and with his horsewhip lashed him most severely. He then untied\r\nhim and rode off without saying a word.\r\n\r\n\"It was a general practice, while I was at Huntsville, Alabama, to\r\nhave a patrol every night; and, to my knowledge, this patrol was in\r\nthe habit of traversing the streets with cow-skins, and, if they found\r\nany slaves out after eight o'clock without a pass, to whip them until\r\nthey were out of reach, or to confine them until morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. J.G. BALDWIN, of Middletown, Connecticut, a member of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, gives the following testimony:--\r\n\r\n\"I traveled at the south in 1827: when near Charlotte, N.C. a free\r\ncolored man fell into the road just ahead of me, and went on\r\npeaceably.--When passing a public-house, the landlord ran out with a\r\nlarge cudgel, and applied it to the head and shoulders of the man with\r\nsuch force as to shatter it in pieces. When the reason of his conduct\r\nwas asked, he replied, that he owned slaves, and he would not permit\r\nfree blacks to come into his neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\"Not long after, I stopped at a public-house near Halifax, N.C.,\r\nbetween nine and ten o'clock P.M., to stay over night. A slave sat\r\nupon a bench in the bar-room asleep. The master came in, seized a\r\nlarge horsewhip, and, without any warning or apparent provocation,\r\nlaid it over the face and eyes of the slave. The master cursed, swore,\r\nand swung his lash--the slave cowered and trembled, but said not a\r\nword. Upon inquiry the next morning, I ascertained that the only\r\noffence was falling asleep, and this too in consequence of having been\r\nup nearly all the previous night, in attendance upon company.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. JOSEPH M. SADD, of Castile, N.Y., who has lately left Missouri,\r\nwhere he was pastor of a church for some years, says:--\r\n\r\n\"In one case, near where we lived, a runaway slave, when brought back,\r\nwas most cruelly beaten--bathed in the _usual_ liquid--laid in the\r\nsun, and a physician employed to heal his wounds:--then the same\r\nprocess of punishment and healing was _repeated_, _and repeated\r\nagain_, and then the poor creature was sold for the New Orleans\r\nmarket. This account we had from the _physician himself_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ABRAHAM BELL, of Poughkeepsie, New York, a member of the Scotch\r\nPresbyterian Church, was employed, in 1837 and 38, in levelling and\r\ngrading for a rail-road in the state of Georgia: he had under his\r\ndirection, during the whole time, thirty slaves. Mr. B. gives the\r\nfollowing testimony:--\r\n\r\n\"_All_ the slaves had their backs scarred, from the oft-repeated\r\nwhippings they had received.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. ALONZO BARNARD, of Farmington, Ohio, who was in Mississippi in\r\n1837 and 8, says:--\r\n\r\n\"The slaves were often severely whipped. I saw one _woman_ very\r\nseverely whipped for accidentally cutting up a stalk of cotton.[8]\r\nWhen they were whipped they were commonly _held down by four men_: if\r\nthese could not confine them, they were fastened by stakes driven\r\nfirmly into the ground, and then lashed often so as to draw blood at\r\neach blow. I saw one woman who had lately been delivered of a child in\r\nconsequence of cruel treatment.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Mr. Cornelius Johnson, of Farmington, Ohio, was also a\r\nwitness to this inhuman outrage upon an unprotected woman, for the\r\nunintentional destruction of a stalk of cotton! In his testimony he is\r\nmore particular, and says, that the number of lashes inflicted upon\r\nher by the overseer was \"ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. H. LYMAN, late pastor of the Free Presbyterian Church at Buffalo,\r\nN.Y. says:--\r\n\r\n\"There was a steam cotton press, in the vicinity of my boarding-house\r\nat New Orleans, which was driven night and day, without intermission.\r\nMy curiosity led me to look at the interior of the establishment.\r\nThere I saw several slaves engaged in rolling cotton bags, fastening\r\nropes lading carts, &c.\r\n\r\n\"The presiding genius of the place was a driver, who held a rope four\r\nfeet long in his hand, which he wielded with cruel dexterity. He used\r\nit in single blows, just as the men were lifting to _tighten_ the bale\r\ncords. It seemed to me that he was desirous to edify me with a\r\nspecimen of his authority; at any rate the cruelty was horrible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN VANCE, a member of the Baptist Church, in St. Albans, Licking\r\ncounty, Ohio, who moved from Culpepper county, Va., his native state\r\nin 1814, testifies as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In 1826, I saw a woman by the name of Mallix, flog her female slave\r\nwith a horse-whip so horribly that she was washed in salt and water\r\nseveral days, to keep her bruises from mortifying.\r\n\r\n\"In 1811, I was returning from mill, in Shenandoah county, when I\r\nheard the cry of murder, in the field of a man named Painter. I rode\r\nto the place to see what was going on. Two men, by the names of John\r\nMorgan and Michael Siglar, had heard the cry and came running to the\r\nplace. I saw Painter beating a negro with a tremendous club, or small\r\nhandspike, swearing he would kill him: but he was rescued by Morgan\r\nand Siglar. I learned that Painter had commenced flogging the slave\r\nfor not getting to work soon enough. He had escaped, and taken refuge\r\nunder a pile of rails that were on some timbers up a little from the\r\nground. The master had put fire to one end, and stood at the other\r\nwith his club, to kill him as he came out. The pile was still burning.\r\nPainter said he was a turbulent fellow and he _would_ kill him. The\r\napprehension of P. was TALKED ABOUT, but, as a compromise, the negro\r\nwas sold to another man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE PUBLISHED JOURNAL OF THE LATE WM. SAVER, of\r\nPhiladelphia, an eminent minister of the Religious Society of\r\nFriends:--\r\n\r\n\"6th mo. 22d, 1791. We passed on to Augusta, Georgia. They can\r\nscarcely tolerate us, on account of our abhorrence of slavery. On the\r\n28th we got to Savannah, and lodged at one Blount's, a hard-hearted\r\nslaveholder. One of his lads, aged about fourteen, was ordered to go\r\nand milk the cow: and falling asleep, through weariness, the master\r\ncalled out and ordered him a flogging. I asked him what he meant by a\r\nflogging. He replied, the way we serve them here is, we cut their\r\nbacks until they are raw all over, and then salt them. Upon this my\r\nfeelings were roused; I told him that was too bad, and queried *if it\r\nwere possible; he replied it was, with many curses upon the blacks. At\r\nsupper this unfeeling wretch _craved a blessing_!\r\n\r\n\"Next morning I heard some one begging for mercy, and also the lash as\r\nof a whip. Not knowing whence the sound came, I rose, and presently\r\nfound the poor boy tied up to a post, his toes scarcely touching the\r\nground, and a negro whipper. He had already cut him in an unmerciful\r\nmanner, and the blood ran to his heels. I stepped in between them, and\r\nordered him untied immediately, which, with some reluctance and\r\nastonishment, was done. Returning to the house I saw the landlord, who\r\nthen showed himself in his true colors, the most abominably wicked man\r\nI ever met with, full of horrid execrations and threatenings upon all\r\nnorthern people; but I did not spare him; which occasioned a bystander\r\nto say, with an oath, that I should be \"popped over.\" We left them,\r\nand were in full expectation of their way-laying or coming after us,\r\nbut the Lord restrained them. The next house we stopped at we found\r\nthe same wicked spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCol. ELIJAH ELLSWORTH, of Richfield, Ohio, gives the following\r\ntestimony:--\r\n\r\n\"Eight or ten years ago I was in Putnam county, in the state of\r\nGeorgia, at a Mr. Slaughter's, the father of my brother's wife. A\r\nnegro, that belonged to Mr. Walker, (I believe,) was accused of\r\nstealing a pedlar's trunk. The negro denied, but, without ceremony,\r\nwas lashed to a tree--the whipping commenced--six or eight men took\r\nturns--the poor fellow begged for mercy, but without effect, until he\r\nwas literally _cut to pieces, from his shoulders to his hips_, and\r\ncovered with a gore of blood. When he said the trunk was in a stack of\r\nfodder, he was unlashed. They proceeded to the stack, but found no\r\ntrunk. They asked the poor fellow, what he lied about it for; he said,\r\n\"Lord, Massa, to keep from being whipped to death; I know nothing\r\nabout the trunk.\" They commenced the whipping with redoubled vigor,\r\nuntil I really supposed he would be whipped to death on the spot; and\r\nsuch shrieks and crying for mercy! Again he acknowledged, and again\r\nthey were defeated in finding, and the same reason given as before.\r\nSome were for whipping again, others thought he would not survive\r\nanother, and they ceased. About two months after, the trunk was found,\r\nand it was then ascertained who the thief was: and the poor fellow,\r\nafter being nearly beat to death, and twice made to lie about it, was\r\nas innocent as I was.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following statements are furnished by Major HORACE NYE, of Putnam,\r\nMuskingum county, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of 1837, Mr. JOHN H. MOOREHEAD, a partner of mine,\r\ndescended the Mississippi with several boat loads of flour. He told me\r\nthat floating in a place in the Mississippi, where he could see for\r\nmiles a head, he perceived a concourse of people on the bank, that for\r\nat least a mile and a half above he saw them, and heard the screams of\r\nsome person, and from a great distance, the crack of a whip, he run\r\nnear the shore, and saw them whipping a black man, who was on the\r\nground, and at that time nearly unable to scream, but the whip\r\ncontinued to be applied without intermission, as long as he was in\r\nsight, say from one mile and a half, to two miles below--he probably\r\nsaw and heard them for one hour in all. He expressed the opinion that\r\nthe man could not survive.\r\n\r\n\"About four weeks since I had a conversation with Mr. Porter, a\r\nrespectable citizen of Morgan county of this state, of about fifty\r\nyears of age. He told me that he formerly traveled about five years in\r\nthe southern states, and that on one occasion he stopped at a private\r\nhouse, to stay all night; (I think it was in Virginia,) while he was\r\nconversing with the man, his wife came in, and complained that the\r\nwench had broken some article in the kitchen, and that she must be\r\nwhipped. He took the _woman_ into the door yard, stripped her clothes\r\ndown to her hips--tied her hands together, and drawing them up to a\r\nlimb, so that she could just touch the ground, took a very large\r\ncowskin whip, and commenced flogging; he said that every stroke at\r\nfirst raised the skin, and immediately the blood came through; this he\r\ncontinued, until the blood stood in a puddle down at her feet. He then\r\nturned to my informant and said, 'Well, Yankee, what do you think of\r\nthat?'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM MR. W. DUSTIN, a member of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church, and, when the letter was written, 1835, a student of\r\nMarietta College, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"I find by looking over my journal that the murdering, which I spoke\r\nof yesterday, took place about the first of June, 1834.\r\n\r\n\"Without commenting upon this act of cruelty, or giving vent to my own\r\nfeelings, I will simply give you a statement of the fact, as known\r\nfrom _personal_ observation.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. K. a man of wealth, and a practising physician in the county of\r\nYazoo, state of Mississippi, personally known to me, having lived in\r\nthe same neighborhood more than twelve months, after having scourged\r\none of his negroes for running away, declared with an oath, that if he\r\nran away again, he would kill him. The negro, so soon as an\r\nopportunity offered, ran away again. He was caught and brought back.\r\nAgain he was scourged, until his flesh, mangled and torn, and thick\r\nmingled with the clotted blood, rolled from his back. He became\r\napparently insensible, and beneath the heaviest stroke would scarcely\r\nutter a groan. The master got tired, laid down his whip and nailed the\r\nnegro's ear to a tree; in this condition, nailed fast to the rugged\r\nwood, he remained all night!\r\n\r\n\"Suffice it to say, in the conclusion, that the next day he was found\r\nDEAD!\r\n\r\n\"Well, what did they do with the master? The sum total of it is this:\r\nhe was taken before a magistrate and gave bonds, for his appearance at\r\nthe next court. Well, to be sure he had plenty of cash, so he paid up\r\nhis bonds and moved away, and there the matter ended.\r\n\r\n\"If the above fact will be of any service to you in exhibiting to the\r\nworld the condition of the unfortunate negroes, you are at liberty to\r\nmake use of it in any way you think best.\r\n\r\nYours, fraternally, M. DUSTIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. ALFRED WILKINSON, a member of the Baptist Church in Skeneateles,\r\nN.Y. and the assessor of that town, has furnished the following:\r\n\r\n\"I went down the Mississippi in December, 1838 and saw twelve of\r\nfourteen negroes punished on one plantation, by stretching them on a\r\nladder and tying them to it; then stripping off their clothes, and\r\nwhipping them on the naked flesh with a heavy whip, the lash seven or\r\neight feet long: most of the strokes cut the skin. I understood they\r\nwere whipped for not doing the tasks allotted to them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE PHILANTHROPIST, Cincinnati, Ohio, Feb. 26, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"A very intelligent lady the widow of a highly respectable preacher of\r\nthe gospel of the Presbyterian Church, formerly a resident of a free\r\nstate, and a colonizationist, and a strong antiabolitionist, who,\r\nalthough an enemy to slavery, was opposed to abolition on the ground\r\nthat it was for carrying things too rapidly, and without regard to\r\ncircumstances, and especially who believed that abolitionists\r\nexaggerated with regard to the evils of slavery, and used to say that\r\nsuch men ought to go to slave states and see for themselves, to be\r\nconvinced that they did the slaveholders injustice, has gone and seen\r\nfor herself. Hear her testimony.\"\r\n\r\n_Kentucky, Dec._ 25, 1835.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mrs. W.--I am still in the land of oppression and cruelty, but\r\nhope soon to breathe the air of a free state. My soul is sick of\r\nslavery, and I rejoice that my time is nearly expired: but the scenes\r\nthat I have witnessed have made an impression that never can be\r\neffaced, and have inspired me with the determination to unite my\r\nfeeble efforts with those who are laboring to suppress this horrid\r\nsystem. I am _now_ an _abolitionist_. You will cease to be surprised\r\nat this, when I inform you, that I have just seen a poor slave who was\r\nbeaten by his inhuman master until he could neither walk nor stand. I\r\nsaw him from my window carried from the barn where he had been\r\nwhipped to the cabin, by two negro men; and he now lies there, and if\r\nhe recovers, will be a sufferer for months, and probably for life. You\r\nwill doubtless suppose that he committed some great crime; but it was\r\nnot so. He was called upon by a young man (the son of his master,) to\r\ndo something, and not moving as quickly as his young master wished him\r\nto do, he drove him to the barn, knocked him down, and jumped upon\r\nhim, stamped, and then cowhided him until he was almost dead. This is\r\nnot the first act of cruelty that I have seen, though it is the\r\n_worst_; and I am convinced that those who have described the\r\ncruelties of slaveholders, have not exaggerated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM GERRIT SMITH, Esq., of Peterboro'. N.Y.\r\nPeterboro', December 1, 1838.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Union Herald_: \"My dear Sir:--You will be happy\r\nto hear, that the two fugitive slaves, to whom in the brotherly love\r\nof your heart, you gave the use of your horse, are still making\r\nundisturbed progress towards the _monarchical_ land whither\r\n_republican_ slaves escape for the enjoyment of liberty. They had\r\neaten their breakfast, and were seated in my wagon, before day-dawn,\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\n\"Fugitive slaves have before taken my house in their way, but never\r\nany, whose lips and persons made so forcible an appeal to my\r\nsensibilities, and kindled in me so much abhorrence of the\r\nhell-concocted system of American slavery.\r\n\r\n\"The fugitives exhibited their bare backs to myself and a number of my\r\nneighbors.

But, I speak\r\nwithin bounds, when I say, that one-third to one-half of the whole\r\nsurface of the back and shoulders of poor Scott, _consists of scars\r\nand wales resulting from innumerable gashes._ His natural complexion\r\nbeing yellow and the callous places being nearly black, his back and\r\nshoulders remind you of a spotted animal.\"\r\n\r\nThe LOUISVILLE REPORTER (Kentucky,) Jan. 15, 1839, contains the report\r\nof a trial for inhuman treatment of a female slave. The following is\r\nsome of the testimony given in court.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. CONSTANT testified that he saw Mrs. Maxwell at the kitchen door,\r\nwhipping the negro severely, without being particular whether she\r\nstruck her in the face or not. The negro was lacerated by the whip,\r\nand the blood flowing. Soon after, on going down the steps, he saw\r\nquantities of blood on them, and on returning, saw them again. She had\r\nbeen thinly clad--barefooted in very cold weather. Sometimes she had\r\nshoes--sometimes not. In the beginning of the winter she had linsey\r\ndresses, since then, calico ones. During the last four months, had\r\nnoticed many scars on her person. At one time had one of her eyes tied\r\nup for a week. During the last three months seemed declining, and had\r\nbecome stupified. Mr. Winters was passing along the street, heard\r\ncries, looked up through the window that was hoisted, saw the boy\r\nwhipping her, as much as forty or fifty licks, while he staid. The\r\ngirl was stripped down to the hips. The whip seemed to be a cow-hide.\r\nWhenever she turned her face to him, he would hit her across the face\r\neither with the butt end or small end of the whip to make her turn her\r\nback round square to the lash, that he might get a fair blow at her.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Say had noticed several wounds on her person, chiefly bruises.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Porter, keeper of the work-house, into which Milly had been\r\nreceived, thought the injuries on her person very bad--some of them\r\nappeared to be burns--some bruises or stripes, as of a cow-hide.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF REV. JOHN RANKIN, of Ripley, Ohio, to the Editor of the\r\nPhilanthropist.\r\n\r\nRIPLEY, Feb. 20, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"Some time since, a member of the Presbyterian Church of Ebenezer,\r\nBrown county, Ohio, landed his boat at a point on the Mississippi. He\r\nsaw some disturbance among the colored people on the bank. He stepped\r\nup, to see what was the matter. A black man was stretched naked on\r\nthe ground; his hands were tied to a stake, and one held each foot. He\r\nwas doomed to receive fifty lashes; but by the time the overseer had\r\ngiven him twenty-five with his great whip, the blood was standing\r\nround the wretched victim in little puddles. It appeared just as if it\r\nhad rained blood.--Another observer stepped up, and advised to defer\r\nthe other twenty-five to another time, lest the slave might die; and\r\nhe was released, to receive the balance when he should have so\r\nrecruited as to be able to bear it and live. The offence was, coming\r\none hour too late to work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN, who is a native of Tennessee, in his letters on slavery,\r\npublished fifteen years since, says:\r\n\r\n\"A respectable gentleman, who is now a citizen of Flemingsburg,\r\nFleming county, Kentucky, when in the state of South Carolina, was\r\ninvited by a slaveholder, to walk with him and take a view of his\r\nfarm. He complied with the invitation thus given, and in their walk\r\nthey came to the place where the slaves were at work, and found the\r\noverseer whipping one of them very severely for not keeping pace with\r\nhis fellows--in vain the poor fellow alleged that he was sick, and\r\ncould not work. The master seemed to think all was well enough, hence\r\nhe and the gentleman passed on. In the space of an hour they returned\r\nby the same way, and found that the poor slave, who had been whipped\r\nas they first passed by the field of labor, was actually dead! This I\r\nhave from unquestionable authority.\"\r\n\r\nExtract of a letter from a MEMBER OF CONGRESS, to the Editor of the\r\nNew York American, dated Washington, Feb. 18, 1839. The name of the\r\nwriter is with the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\"Three days ago, the inhabitants in the vicinity of the new Patent\r\nBuilding were alarmed by an outcry in the street, which proved to be\r\nthat of a slave who had just been knocked down with a brick-bat by his\r\npursuing master. Prostrate on the ground, with a large gash in his\r\nhead, the poor slave was receiving the blows of his master on one\r\nside, and the kicks of his master's son on the other. His cries\r\nbrought a few individuals to the spot; but no one dared to interfere,\r\nsave to exclaim--You will kill him--which was met by the response, \"He\r\nis mine, and I have a right to do what I please with him.\" The\r\nheart-rending scene was closed from _public_ view by dragging the poor\r\nbruised and wounded slave from the public street into his master's\r\nstable. What followed is not known. The outcries were heard by members\r\nof Congress and others at the distance of near a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the scene.\r\n\r\n\"And now, perhaps, you will ask, is not the city aroused by this\r\nflagrant cruelty and breach of the peace? I answer--not at all. Every\r\nthing is quiet. If the occurrence is mentioned at all, it is spoken of\r\nin whispers.\"\r\n\r\n_From the Mobile Examiner, August_ 1, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"POLICE REPORT--MAYOR'S OFFICE.\r\n_Saturday morning, August_ 12, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"His Honor the Mayor presiding.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. MILLER, of the foundry, brought to the office this morning a\r\nsmall negro girl aged about eight or ten years, whom he had taken into\r\nhis house some time during the previous night. She had crawled under\r\nthe window of his bed room to screen herself from the night air, and\r\nto find a warmer shelter than the open canopy of heaven afforded. Of\r\nall objects of pity that have lately come to our view, this poor\r\nlittle girl most needs the protection of authority, and the sympathies\r\nof the charitable. From the cruelty of her master and mistress, she\r\nhas been whipped, worked and starved, until she is now a breathing\r\nskeleton, hardly able to stand upon her feet.\r\n\r\n\"The back of the poor little sufferer, (which we ourselves saw,) _was\r\nactually cut into strings, and so perfectly was the flesh worn from\r\nher limbs,_ by the wretched treatment she had received, that _every\r\njoint showed distinctly its crevices_ and protuberances through the\r\nskin. Her little lips clung closely over her teeth--her cheeks were\r\nsunken and her head narrowed, and when her eyes were closed, the lids\r\nresembled film more than flesh or skin.\r\n\r\n\"We would desire of our northern friends such as choose to publish to\r\nthe world their own version of the case we have related, not to forget\r\nto add, in conclusion, that the owner of this little girl is a\r\nforeigner, speaks against slavery as an institution, and reads his\r\nBible to his wife, with the view of finding proofs for his opinions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. WILLIAM SCALES, of Lyndon, Vermont, gives the following testimony\r\nin a recent letter:\r\n\r\n\"I had a class-mate at the Andover Theological Seminary, who spent a\r\nseason at the south,--in Georgia, I think--who related the following\r\nfact in an address before the Seminary. It occasioned very deep\r\nsensation on the part of opponents. The gentleman was Mr. Julius C.\r\nAnthony, of Taunton, Mass. He graduated at the Seminary in 1835. I do\r\nnot know where he is now settled. I have no doubt of the fact, as be\r\nwas an _eye-witness_ of it. The man with whom he resided had a very\r\nathletic slave--a valuable fellow--a blacksmith. On a certain day a\r\nsmall strap of leather was missing. The man's little son accused this\r\nslave of stealing it. He denied the charge, while the boy most\r\nconfidently asserted it. The slave was brought out into the yard and\r\nbound--his hands below his knees, and a stick crossing his knees, so\r\nthat he would lie upon either side in form of the letter S. One of the\r\noverseers laid on fifty lashes--he still denied the theft--was turned\r\nover and fifty more put on. Sometimes the master and sometimes the\r\noverseers whipping--as they relieved each other to take breath. Then\r\nhe was for a time left to himself, and in the course of the day\r\nreceived FOUR HUNDRED LASHES--still denying the charge, Next morning\r\nMr. Anthony walked out--the sun was just rising--he saw the man\r\ngreatly enfeabled, leaning against a stump. It was time to go to\r\nwork--he attempted to rise, but fell back--again attempted, and again\r\nfell back--still making the attempt, and still falling back, Mr.\r\nAnthony thought, nearly _twenty times_ before he succeeded in\r\nstanding--he then staggered off to his shop. In course of the morning\r\nMr. A. went to the door and looked in. Two overseers were standing by.\r\nThe slave was feverish and sick--his skin and mouth dry and parched.\r\nHe was very thirsty. One of the overseers, while Mr. A, was looking at\r\nhim, inquired of the other whether it were not best to give him a\r\nlittle water. 'No. damn him, he will do well enough,' was the reply\r\nfrom the other overseer. This was all the relief gained by the poor\r\nslave. A few days after, the slaveholder's _son confessed that he\r\nstole the strap himself._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. D.C. EASTMAN, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal church at\r\nBloomingburg, Fayette county, Ohio, has just forwarded a letter, from\r\nwhich the following is an extract:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE ROEBUCK, an old and respectable farmer, near Bloomingburg,\r\nFayette county, Ohio, a member of the Methodist Episcopal church,\r\nsays, that almost forty-three years ago, he saw in Bath county,\r\nVirginia, a slave girl with a sore between the shoulders of the size\r\nand shape of a _smoothing iron._ The girl was 'owned' by one M'Neil. A\r\nslaveholder who boarded at M'Neil's stated that Mrs. M'Neil had placed\r\nthe aforesaid iron when hot, between the girl's shoulders, and\r\nproduced the sore.\r\n\r\n\"Roebuck was once at this M'Neil's father's, and whilst the old man\r\nwas at morning prayer, he heard the son plying the whip upon a slave\r\nout of doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ELI WEST, of Concord township, Fayette county, Ohio, formerly of\r\nNorth Carolina, a farmer and an exhorter in the Methodist Protestant\r\nchurch, says, that many years since he went to live with an uncle who\r\nowned about fifty negroes. Soon after his arrival, his uncle ordered\r\nhis waiting boy, who was _naked_, to be tied--his hands to horse rack,\r\nand his feet together, with a rail passed between his legs, and held\r\ndown by a person at each end. In this position he was whipped, from\r\nneck to feet, till covered with blood; after which he was _salted._\r\n\r\n\"His uncle's slaves received one quart of corn each day, and that\r\nonly, and were allowed one hour each day to cook and eat it. They had\r\nno meat but once in the year. Such was the general usage in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"West, after this, lived one year with Esquire Starky and mother. They\r\nhad two hundred slaves, who received the usual treatment of\r\nstarvation, nakedness, and the cowhide. They had one lively negro\r\nwoman who bore no children. For this neglect, her mistress had her\r\nback made naked and a severe whipping inflicted. But as she continued\r\nbarren, she was sold to the 'negro buyers.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS LARRIMER, a deacon in the Presbyterian church at Bloomingburg,\r\nFayette county, Ohio, and a respectable farmer, says, that in April,\r\n1837, as he was going down the Mississippi river, about fifty miles\r\nbelow Natchez, he saw ahead, on the left side of the river, a colored\r\nperson tied to a post, and a man with a driver's whip, the lash about\r\neight or ten feet long. With this the man commenced, with much\r\ndeliberation, to whip, with much apparent force, and continued till he\r\ngot out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"When coming up the river forty or fifty miles below Vicksburg, a\r\nJudge Owens came on board the steamboat. He was owner of a cotton\r\nplantation below there, and on being told of the above whipping, he\r\nsaid that slaves were often whipped to death for great offences, such\r\nas _stealing,_ &c.--but that when death followed, the overseers were\r\ngenerally severely _reproved!_\r\n\r\n\"About the same time, he spent a night at Mr. Casey's, three miles\r\nfrom Columbia, South Carolina. Whilst there they heard him giving\r\norders as to what was to be done, and amongst other things, \"That\r\nnigger must be buried.\" On inquiry, he learnt that a gentleman\r\ntraveling with a servant, had a short time previous called there, and\r\nsaid his servant had just been taken ill, and he should be under the\r\nnecessity of leaving him. He did so. The slave became worst, and\r\nCasey called in a physician, who pronounced it an old case, and said\r\nthat he must shortly die. The slave said, if that was the case he\r\nwould now tell the truth. He had been attacked, a long time since,\r\nwith a difficulty in the side--his master swore he would 'have his own\r\nout of him' and started off to sell him, with a threat to kill him if\r\nhe told he had been sick, more than a few days. They saw them making\r\na rough plank box to bury him in.\r\n\r\n\"In March, 1833, twenty-five or thirty miles south of Columbia, on the\r\ngreat road through Sumpterville district, they saw a large company of\r\nfemale slaves carrying rails and building fence. Three of them were\r\nfar advanced in pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of January, 1838, he put up with a drove of mules and\r\nhorses, at one Adams', on the Drovers' road, near the south border of\r\nKentucky. His son-in-law, who had lived in the south, was there. In\r\nconversation about picking cotton, he said, 'some hands cannot get the\r\nsleight of it. I have a girl who to-day has done as good a day's work\r\nat grubbing as any _man_, but I could not make her a hand at\r\ncotton-picking. I whipped her, and if I did it once I did it five\r\nhundred times, but I found she _could_ not; so I put her to carrying\r\nrails with the men. After a few days I found her shoulders were so\r\n_raw_ that every rail was _bloody_ as she laid it down. I asked her if\r\nshe would not rather pick cotton than carry rails. 'No,' said she, 'I\r\ndon't get whipped now.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM A. USTICK, an elder of the Presbyterian church at\r\nBloomingburg, and Mr. G.S. Fullerton, a merchant and member of the\r\nsame church, were with Deacon Larrimer on this journey, and are\r\nwitnesses to the preceding facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SAMUEL HALL, a teacher in Marietta College, Ohio, and formerly\r\nsecretary of the Colonization society in that village, has recently\r\ncommunicated the facts that follow. We quote from his letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The following horrid flagellation was witnessed in part, till his\r\nsoul was sick, by MR. GLIDDEN, an inhabitant of Marietta, Ohio, who\r\nwent down the Mississippi river, with a boat load of produce in the\r\nautumn of 1837; it took place at what is called 'Matthews' or\r\n'Matheses Bend' in December, 1837. Mr. G. is worthy of credit.\r\n\r\n\"A negro was tied up, and flogged until the blood ran down and filled\r\nhis shoes, so that when he raised either foot and set it down again,\r\nthe blood would run over their tops. I could not look on any longer,\r\nbut turned away in horror; the whipping was continued to the number of\r\n500 lashes, as I understood; a quart of spirits of turpentine was then\r\napplied to his lacerated body. The same negro came down to my boat, to\r\nget some apples, and was so weak from his wounds and loss of blood,\r\nthat he could not get up the bank, but fell to the ground. The crime\r\nfor which the negro was whipped, was that of telling the other\r\nnegroes, that _the overseer had lain with his wife.\"_\r\n\r\nMr. Hall adds:--\r\n\r\n\"The following statement is made by a young man from Western Virginia.\r\nHe is a member of the Presbyterian Church, and a student in Marietta\r\nCollege. All that prevents the introduction of his _name,_ is the\r\nperil to his life, which would probably be the consequence, on his\r\nreturn to Virginia. His character for integrity and veracity is above\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n\"On the night of the great meteoric shower, in Nov. 1833. I was at\r\nRemley's tavern, 12 miles west of Lewisburg, Greenbrier Co., Virginia.\r\nA drove of 50 or 60 negroes stopped at the same place that night.\r\nThey usually 'camp out,' but as it was excessively muddy, they were\r\npermitted to come into the house. So far as my knowledge extends,\r\n'droves,' on their way to the south, eat but twice a day, early in the\r\nmorning and at night. Their supper was a compound of 'potatoes and\r\nmeal,' and was, without exception, the _dirtiest, blackest looking\r\nmess I ever saw._ I remarked at the time that the food was not as\r\nclean, in appearance, as that which was given to a _drove of hogs_, at\r\nthe same place the night previous. Such as it was, however, a black\r\nwoman brought it on her head, in a tray or trough two and a half feet\r\nlong, where the men and women were promiscuously herded. The slaves\r\nrushed up and seized it from the trough in handfulls, before the woman\r\ncould take it off her head. They jumped at it as if half-famished.\r\n\r\n\"They slept on the floor of the room which they were permitted to\r\noccupy, lying in every form imaginable, males and females,\r\npromiscuously. They were so thick on the floor, that in passing\r\nthrough the room it was necessary to step over them.\r\n\r\n\"There were three drivers, one of whom staid in the room to watch the\r\ndrove, and the other two slept in an adjoining room. Each of the\r\nlatter took a female from the drove to lodge with him, as is the\r\ncommon practice of the drivers generally. There is no doubt about this\r\nparticular instance, _for they were seen together_. The mud was so\r\nthick on the floor where this drove slept, that it was necessary to\r\ntake a shovel, the next morning, and clear it out. Six or eight in\r\nthis drove were chained; all were for the south.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the same year I saw a drove of upwards of a hundred,\r\nbetween 40 and 50 of them were fastened to one chain, the links being\r\nmade of iron rods, as thick in diameter as a man's little finger. This\r\ndrove was bound westward to the Ohio river, to be shipped to the\r\nsouth. I have seen many droves, and more or less in each, almost\r\nwithout exception, were chained. I never saw but one drove, that went\r\non their way making merry. In that one they were blowing horns,\r\nsinging, &c., and appeared as if they had been drinking whisky.\r\n\r\n\"They generally appear extremely dejected. I have seen in the course\r\nof five years, on the road near where I reside, 12 or 15 droves at\r\nleast, passing to the south. They would average 40 in each drove. Near\r\nthe first of January, 1834, I started about sunrise to go to\r\nLewisburg. It was a bitter cold morning. I met a drove of negroes, 30\r\nor 40 in number, remarkably ragged and destitute of clothing. One\r\nlittle boy particularly excited my sympathy. He was some distance\r\nbehind the others, not being able to keep up with the rest. Although\r\nhe was shivering with cold and crying, the driver was pushing him up\r\nin a trot to overtake the main gang. All of them looked as if they\r\nwere half-frozen. There was one remarkable instance of tyranny,\r\nexhibited by a boy, not more than eight years old, that came under my\r\nobservation, in a family by the name of D----n, six miles from\r\nLewisburg. This youngster would swear at the slaves, and exert all the\r\nstrength he possessed, to flog or beat them, with whatever instrument\r\nor weapon he could lay hands on, provided they did not obey him\r\n_instanter_. He was encouraged in this by his father, the master of\r\nthe slaves. The slaves often fled from this young tyrant in terror.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hall adds:--\r\n\r\n\"The following extract is from a letter, to a student in Marietta\r\nCollege, by his friend in Alabama. With the writer, Mr. Isaac Knapp, I\r\nam perfectly acquainted. He was a student in the above College, for\r\nthe space of one year, before going to Alabama, was formerly a\r\nresident of Dummerston, Vt. He is a professor of religion, and as\r\nworthy of belief as any member of the community. Mr. K. has returned\r\nfrom the South, and is now a member of the same college.\r\n\r\n\"In Jan. (1838) a negro of a widow Phillips, ranaway, was taken up,\r\nand confined in Pulaski jail. One Gibbs, overseer for Mrs. P., mounted\r\non horseback, took him from confinement, compelled him to run back to\r\nElkton, a distance of fifteen miles, whipping him all the way. When he\r\nreached home, the negro exhausted and worn out, exclaimed, 'you have\r\nbroke my heart,' i.e. you have killed me. For this, Gibbs flew into a\r\nviolent passion, tied the negro to a stake, and, in the language of a\r\nwitness, '_cut his back to mince-meat_.' But the fiend was not\r\nsatisfied with this. He burnt his legs to a blister, with hot embers,\r\nand then chained him _naked_, in the open air, weary with running,\r\nweak from the loss of blood, and smarting from his burns. It was a\r\ncold night--and _in the morning the negro was dead_. Yet this monster\r\nescaped without even _the shadow_ of a trial. 'The negro,' said the\r\ndoctor, 'died, by--he knew not what; any how, Gibbs did not kill\r\nhim.'[9]  A short time since, (the letter is dated, April, 1838.)\r\n'Gibbs whipped another negro unmercifully because the horse, with\r\nwhich he was ploughing, broke the reins and ran. He then raised his\r\nwhip against Mr. Bowers, (son of Mrs. P.) who shot him. Since I came\r\nhere,' (a period of about six months,) there have been eight white men\r\nand two negroes killed, within 30 miles of me.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Mr. Knapp, gives me some further verbal particulars about\r\nthis affair. He says that his informant saw the negro dead the next\r\nmorning, that his legs were blistered, and that the negroes affirmed\r\nthat Gibbs compelled them to throw embers upon him. But Gibbs denied\r\nit, and said the blistering was the effect of frost, as the negro was\r\nmuch exposed to before being taken up. Mr. Bowers, a son of Mrs.\r\nPhillips by a former husband, attempted to have Gibbs brought to\r\njustice, but his mother justified Gibbs, and nothing was therefore\r\ndone about it. The affair took place in Upper Elkton, Tennessee, near\r\nthe Alabama line.]\r\n\r\nThe following is from Mr. Knapp's own lips, taken down a day or two\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Buster, with whom I boarded, in Limestone Co., Ala., related to me\r\nthe following incident: 'George a slave belonging to one of the\r\nestates in my neighborhood, was lurking about my residence without a\r\npass. We were making preparations to give him a flogging, but he\r\nescaped from us. Not long afterwards, meeting a patrol which had just\r\ntaken a negro in custody without a pass, I inquired, Who have you\r\nthere? on learning that it was _George_, well, I rejoined, there is a\r\nsmall matter between him and myself that needs adjustment, so give me\r\nthe raw hide, which I accordingly took, and laid 60 strokes on his\r\nback, to the utmost of my strength.' I was speaking of this barbarity,\r\nafterwards, to Mr. Bradley, an overseer of the Rev. Mr. Donnell, who\r\nlives in the vicinity of Moresville, Ala., 'Oh,' replied he, 'we\r\nconsider _that_ a very light whipping here' Mr. Bradley is a professor\r\nof religion, and is esteemed in that vicinity a very pious, exemplary\r\nChristian.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM REV. C. STEWART RENSHAW, of Quincy, Illinois,\r\ndated Jan. 1, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"I do not feel at liberty to disclose the name of the brother who has\r\nfurnished the following facts. He is highly esteemed as a man of\r\nscrupulous veracity. I will confirm my own testimony by the\r\ncertificate of Judge Snow and Mr. Keyes, two of the oldest and most\r\nrespectable settlers in Quincy.\r\n\r\nQuincy, Dec. 29, 1838\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,--We have been long acquainted with the Christian brother\r\nwho has named to you some facts that fell under his observation while\r\na resident of slave states. He is a member of a Christian church, in\r\ngood standing; and is a man of strict integrity of character.\r\n\r\nHenry H. Snow, Willard Keyes.\r\nRev. C. Stewart Renshaw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My informant spent thirty years of his life in Kentucky and Missouri.\r\nWhilst in Kentucky he resided in Hardin co. I noted down his testimony\r\nvery nearly in his own words, which will account for their\r\n_evidence-like_ form. On the general condition of the slaves in\r\nKentucky, through Hardin co., he said, their houses were very\r\nuncomfortable, generally without floors, other than the earth: many\r\nhad puncheon floors, but he never remembers to have seen a plank\r\nfloor. In regard to clothing they were very badly off. In summer\r\nthey cared little for clothing; but in winter they almost froze. Their\r\nrags might hide their nakedness from the sun in summer, but would not\r\nprotect them from the cold in winter. Their bed-clothes were tattered\r\nrags, thrown into a corner by day, and drawn before the fire by night.\r\n'The only thing,' said he, 'to which I can compare them, in winter, is\r\n_stock without a shelter.'_\r\n\r\n\"He made the following comparison between the condition of slaves in\r\nKentucky and Missouri. So far as he was able to compare them, he said,\r\nthat in Missouri the slaves had better _quarters_-but are not so well\r\nclad, and are more severely punished than in Kentucky. In both states,\r\nthe slaves are huddled together, without distinction of sex, into the\r\nsame quarter, till it is filled, then another is built; often two or\r\nthree families in a log hovel, twelve feet square.\r\n\r\n\"It is proper to state, that the sphere of my informant's observation\r\nwas mainly in the region of Hardin co., Kentucky, and the eastern part\r\nof Missouri, and not through those states generally.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst at St. Louis, a number of years ago, as he was going to work\r\nwith Mr. Henry Males, and another carpenter, they heard groans from a\r\nbarn by the road-side: they stopped, and looking through the cracks of\r\nthe barn, saw a negro bound hand and foot to a post, so that his toes\r\njust touched the ground; and his master, Captain Thorpe, was\r\ninflicting punishment; he had whipped him till exhausted,--rested\r\nhimself, and returned again to the punishment. The wretched sufferer\r\nwas in a most pitiable condition, and the warm blood and dry dust of\r\nthe barn had formed a mortar up to his instep. Mr. Males jumped the\r\nfence, and remonstrated so effectually with Capt. Thorpe, that he\r\nceased the punishment. It was six weeks before that slave could put on\r\nhis shirt!\r\n\r\n\"John Mackey, a rich slaveholder, lived near Clarksville, Pike co.,\r\nMissouri, some years since. He whipped his slave Billy, a boy fourteen\r\nyears old, till he was sick and stupid; he then sent him home. Then,\r\nfor his stupidity, whipped him again, and fractured his skull with an\r\naxe-helve. He buried him away in the woods; dark words were whispered,\r\nand the body was disinterred. A coroner's inquest was held, and Mr. R.\r\nAnderson, the coroner, brought in a verdict of death from fractured\r\nskull, occasioned by blows from an axe-handle, inflicted by John\r\nMackey. The case was brought into court, but Mackey was rich, and his\r\nmurdered victim was his SLAVE; after expending about $500 be walked\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n\"One Mrs. Mann, living near ----, in ---- co., Missouri was known to\r\nbe very cruel to her slaves. She had a bench made purposely to whip\r\nthem upon; and what she called her \"six pound paddle,\" an instrument\r\nof prodigious torture, bored through with holes; this she would wield\r\nwith both hands as she stood over her prostrate victim.\r\n\r\n\"She thus punished a hired slave woman named Fanny, belonging to Mr.\r\nCharles Trabue, who lives neat Palmyra, Marion co., Missouri; on the\r\nmorning after the punishment Fanny was a corpse; she was silently and\r\nquickly buried, but rumor was not so easily stopped. Mr. Trabue heard\r\nof it, and commenced suit for his _property_. The murdered slave was\r\ndisinterred, and an inquest held; her back was a mass of jellied\r\nmuscle; and the coroner brought in a verdict of death by the 'six\r\npound paddle.'  Mrs. Mann fled for a few months, but returned again,\r\nand her friends found means to protract the suit.\r\n\r\n\"This same Mrs. Mann had another hired slave woman living with her,\r\ncalled Patterson's Fanny, she belonged to a Mr. Patterson; she had a\r\nyoung babe with her, just beginning to creep. One day, after washing,\r\nwhilst a tub of rinsing water yet stood in the kitchen, Mrs. Mann came\r\nout in haste, and sent Fanny to do something out of doors. Fanny tried\r\nto beg off--she was afraid to leave her babe, lest it should creep to\r\nthe tub and get hurt--Mrs. M. said she would watch the babe, and sent\r\nher off. She went with much reluctance, and heard the child struggle\r\nas she went out the door. Fearing lest Mrs. M. should leave the babe\r\nalone, she watched the room, and soon saw her pass out of the opposite\r\ndoor. Immediately Fanny hurried in, and looked around for her babe,\r\nshe could not see it, she looked at the tub--there her babe was\r\nfloating, a strangled corpse. The poor woman gave a dreadful scream;\r\nand Mrs. M. rushed into the room, with her hands raised, and\r\nexclaimed, 'Heavens, Fanny! have you drowned your child?' It was vain\r\nfor the poor bereaved one to attempt to vindicate herself: in vain she\r\nattempted to convince them that the babe had not been alone a moment,\r\nand could not have drowned itself; and that she had not been in the\r\nhouse a moment, before she screamed at discovering her drowned babe.\r\nAll was false! Mrs. Mann declared it was all pretence--that Fanny had\r\ndrowned her own babe, and now wanted to lay the blame upon her! and\r\nMrs. Mann was a white woman--of course her word was more valuable than\r\nthe oaths of all the slaves of Missouri. No evidence but that of\r\nslaves could be obtained, or Mr. Patterson would have prosecuted for\r\nhis 'loss of property.'  As it was, every one believed Mrs. M. guilty,\r\nthough the affair was soon hushed up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract of a letter from Col. THOMAS ROGERS, a native of Kentucky, now\r\nan elder in the Presbyterian Church at New Petersburg, Highland co.,\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n\"When a boy, in Bourbon co., Kentucky, my father lived near a\r\nslaveholder of the name of Clay, who had a large number of slaves; I\r\nremember being often at their quarters; not one of their shanties, or\r\nhovels, had any floor but the earth. Their clothing was truly neither\r\nfit for covering nor decency. We could distinctly, of a still morning,\r\nhear this man whipping his blacks, and hear their screams from my\r\nfather's farm; this could be heard almost any still morning about the\r\ndawn of day. It was said to be his usual custom to repair, about the\r\nbreak of day, to their cabin doors, and, as the blacks passed out, to\r\ngive them as many strokes of his cowskin as opportunity afforded; and\r\nhe would proceed in this manner from cabin to cabin until they were\r\nall out. Occasionally some of his slaves would abscond, and upon being\r\nretaken they were punished severely; and some of them, it is believed,\r\ndied in consequence of the cruelty of their usage. I saw one of this\r\nman's slaves, about seventeen years old, wearing a collar, with long\r\niron horns extending from his shoulders far above his head.\r\n\r\n\"In the winter of 1828-29 I traveled through part of the states of\r\nMaryland and Virginia to Baltimore. At Frost Town, on the national\r\nroad, I put up for the night. Soon after, there came in a slaver with\r\nhis drove of slaves; among them were two young men, chained together.\r\nThe bar room was assigned to them for their place of lodging--those in\r\nchains were guarded when they had to go out. I asked the 'owner' why\r\nhe kept these men chained; he replied, that they were stout young\r\nfellows, and should they rebel, he and his son would not be able to\r\nmanage them. I then left the room, and shortly after heard a\r\n_scream_, and when the landlady inquired the cause, the slaver coolly\r\ntold her not to trouble herself, he was only chastising one of his\r\nwomen. It appeared that three days previously her child had died on\r\nthe road, and been thrown into a hole or crevice in the mountain, and\r\na few stones thrown over it; and the mother weeping for her child was\r\nchastised by her master, and told by him, she 'should have something\r\nto cry for.' The name of this man I can give if called for.\r\n\r\n\"When engaged in this journey I spent about one month with my\r\nrelations in Virginia. It being shortly after new year, _the time of\r\nhiring_ was over; but I saw the pounds, and the scaffolds which\r\nremained of the pounds, in which the slaves had been penned up\"\r\n\r\nM. GEORGE W. WESTGATE, of Quincy, Illinois, who lived in the\r\nsouthwestern slave states a number of years, has furnished the\r\nfollowing statement.\r\n\r\n\"The great mass of the slaves are under drivers and overseers. I never\r\nsaw an overseer without a whip; the whip usually carried is a short\r\nloaded stock, with a heavy lash from five to six feet long. When they\r\nwhip a slave they make him pull off his shirt, if he has one, then\r\nmake him lie down on his face, and taking their stand at the length of\r\nthe lash, they inflict the punishment. Whippings are so _universal_\r\nthat a negro that has not been whipped is talked of in all the region\r\nas a wonder. By whipping I do not mean a few lashes across the\r\nshoulders, but a set flogging, and generally _lying down._\r\n\r\n\"On sugar plantations generally, and on some cotton plantations, they\r\nhave negro drivers, who are in such a degree responsible for their\r\ngang, that if they are at fault, the driver is whipped. The result is,\r\nthe gang are constantly driven by him to the extent of the influence\r\nof the lash; and it is uniformly the case that gangs dread a negro\r\ndriver more than a white overseer.\r\n\r\n\"I spent a winter on widow Culvert's plantation, near Rodney,\r\nMississippi, but was not in a situation to see extraordinary\r\npunishments. Bellows, the overseer, for a trifling offence, took one\r\nof the slaves, stripped him, and with a piece of burning wood applied\r\nto his posteriors, burned him cruelly; while the poor wretch screamed\r\nin the greatest agony. The principal preparation for punishment that\r\nBellows had, was single handcuffs made of iron, with chains, by which\r\nthe offender could be chained to four stakes on the ground. These are\r\nvery common in all the lower country. I noticed one slave on widow\r\nCalvert's plantation, who was whipped from twenty-five to fifty lashes\r\nevery fortnight during the whole winter. The expression 'whipped to\r\ndeath,' as applied to slaves, is common at the south.\r\n\r\n\"Several years ago I was going below New Orleans, in what is called\r\nthe Plaquemine country, and a planter sent down in my boat a runaway\r\nhe had found in New Orleans, to his plantation at Orange 5 Points. As\r\nwe came near the Points he told me, with deep feeling, that he\r\nexpected to be whipped almost to death: pointing to a graveyard, he\r\nsaid, 'There lie five who were whipped to death.' Overseers generally\r\nkeep some of the women on the plantation; I scarce know an exception\r\nto this. Indeed, their intercourse with them is very much\r\npromiscuous,--they show them not much, if any favor. Masters\r\nfrequently follow the example of their overseers in this thing.\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE W. WESTGATE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. TORTURES, BY IRON COLLARS, CHAINS, FETTERS, HANDCUFFS, &c.\r\n\r\nThe slaves are often tortured by iron collars, with long prongs or\r\n\"horns\" and sometimes bells attached to them--they are made to wear\r\nchains, handcuffs, fetters, iron clogs, bars, rings, and bands of iron\r\nupon their limbs, iron masks upon their faces, iron gags in their\r\nmouths, &c.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this, we give the testimony of slaveholders themselves,\r\nunder their own names; it will be mostly in the form of extracts from\r\ntheir own advertisements, in southern newspapers, in which, describing\r\ntheir runaway slaves, they specify the iron collars, handcuffs,\r\nchains, fetters, &c., which they wore upon their necks, wrists,\r\nankles, and other parts of their bodies.

NELSON, Esq., a native of Virginia, now a highly respected\r\ncitizen of highland county, Ohio, and member of the Presbyterian\r\nChurch in Hillsborough, in a recent letter states the following:--\r\n\r\n\"In Staunton, Va., at the horse of Mr. Robert M'Dowell, a merchant of\r\nthat place, I once saw a colored woman, of intelligent and dignified\r\nappearance, who appeared to be attending to the business of the house,\r\nwith an _iron collar_ around her neck, with horns or prongs extending\r\nout on either side, and up, until they met at something like a foot\r\nabove her head, at which point there was a bell attached. This _yoke_,\r\nas they called it, I understood was to prevent her from running away,\r\nor to punish her for having done so. I had frequently seen _men_ with\r\niron collars, but this was the first instance that I recollect to have\r\nseen a _female_ thus degraded.\"\r\n\r\nMajor HORACE NYE, an elder in the Presbyterian Church at Putnam,\r\nMuskingum county, Ohio, in a letter, dated Dec. 5, 1838, makes the\r\nfollowing statement:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wm. Armstrong, of this place, who is frequently employed by our\r\ncitizens as captain and supercargo of descending boats, whose word may\r\nbe relied on, has just made to me the following statement:--\r\n\r\n\"While laying at Alexandria, on Red River, Louisiana, he saw a slave\r\nbrought to a blacksmith's shop and a collar of iron fastened round his\r\nneck, with two pieces rivetted to the sides, meeting some distance\r\nabove his head. At the top of the arch, thus formed, was attached a\r\nlarge cow-bell, the motion of which, while walking the streets, made\r\nit necessary for the slave to hold his hand to one of its sides, to\r\nsteady it.\r\n\r\n\"In New Orleans he saw several with iron collars, with horns attached\r\nto them. The first he saw had three prongs projecting from the collar\r\nten or twelve inches, with the letter S on the end of each. He says\r\niron collars are quite frequent there.\"\r\n\r\nTo the preceding Major Nye adds:--\r\n\r\n\"When I was about twelve years of age I lived at Marietta, in this\r\nstate: I knew little of slaves, as there were few or none, at that\r\ntime, in the part of Virginia opposite that place. But I remember\r\nseeing a slave who had run away from some place beyond my knowledge at\r\nthat time: he had an iron collar round his neck, to which was a strap\r\nof iron rivetted to the collar, on each side, passing over the top of\r\nthe head; and another strap, from the back side to the top of the\r\nfirst--thus inclosing the head on three sides. I looked on while the\r\nblacksmith severed the collar with a file, which, I think, took him\r\nmore than an hour.\"\r\n\r\nRev. JOHN DUDLEY, Mount Morris, Michigan, resided as a teacher at the\r\nmissionary station, among the Choctaws, in Mississippi, during the\r\nyears 1830 and 31. In a letter just received Mr. Dudley says:--\r\n\r\n\"During the time I was on missionary ground, which was in 1830 and 31,\r\nI was frequently at the residence of the agent, who was a\r\nslaveholder.--I never knew of his treating his own slaves with\r\ncruelty; but the poor fellows who were escaping, and lodged with him\r\nwhen detected, found no clemency. I once saw there a fetter for '_the\r\nd----d runaways_,' the weight of which can be judged by its size. It\r\nwas at least three inches wide, half an inch thick, and something over\r\na foot long. At this time I saw a poor fellow compelled to work in the\r\nfield, at 'logging,' with such a galling fetter on his ankles. To\r\nprevent it from wearing his ankles, a string was tied to the centre,\r\nby which the victim suspended it when he walked, with one hand, and\r\nwith the other carried his burden. Whenever he lifted, the fetter\r\nrested on his bare ankles. If he lost his balance and made a misstep,\r\nwhich must very often occur in lifting and rolling logs, the torture\r\nof his fetter was severe. Thus he was doomed to work while wearing the\r\ntorturing iron, day after day, and at night he was confined in the\r\nrunaways' jail. Some time after this, I saw the same dejected,\r\nheart-broken creature obliged to wait on the other hands, who were\r\nhusking corn. The privilege of sitting with the others was too much\r\nfor him to enjoy; he was made to hobble from house to barn and barn to\r\nhouse, to carry food and drink for the rest. He passed round the end\r\nof the house where I was sitting with the agent: he seemed to take no\r\nnotice of me, but fixed his eyes on his tormentor till he passed quite\r\nby us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. ALFRED WILKINSON, member of the Baptist Church in Skeneateles,\r\nN.Y. and an assessor of that town, testifies as follows :--\r\n\r\n\"I stayed in New Orleans three weeks: during that time there used to\r\npass by where I stayed a number of slaves, each with an iron band\r\naround his ankle, a chain attached to it, and an eighteen pound ball\r\nat the end. They were employed in wheeling dirt with a wheelbarrow;\r\nthey would put the ball into the barrow when they moved.--I recollect\r\none day, that I counted nineteen of them, sometimes there were not as\r\nmany; they were driven by a slave, with a long lash, as if they were\r\nbeasts. These, I learned, were runaway slaves from the plantations\r\nabove New Orleans.\r\n\r\n\"There was also a negro woman, that used daily to come to the market\r\nwith milk; she had an iron band around her neck, with three rods\r\nprojecting from it, about sixteen inches long, crooked at the ends.\"\r\n\r\nFor the fact which follows we are indebted to Mr. SAMUEL HALL, a\r\nteacher in Marietta College, Ohio. We quote his letter.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Curtis, a journeyman cabinet-maker, of Marietta, relates the\r\nfollowing, of which he was an eye witness. Mr. Curtis is every way\r\nworthy of credit.\r\n\r\n\"In September, 1837, at 'Milligan's Bend,' in the Mississippi river, I\r\nsaw a negro with an iron band around his head, locked behind with a\r\npadlock. In the front, where it passed the mouth, there was a\r\nprojection inward of an inch and a half, which entered the mouth.\r\n\r\n\"The overseer told me, he was so addicted to running away, it did not\r\ndo any good to whip him for it. He said he kept this gag constantly on\r\nhim, and intended to do so as long as he was on the plantation: so\r\nthat, if he ran away, he could not eat, and would starve to death. The\r\nslave asked for drink in my presence; and the overseer made him lie\r\ndown on his back, and turned water on his face two or three feet high,\r\nin order to torment him, as he could not swallow a drop.--The slave\r\nthen asked permission to go to the river; which being granted, he\r\nthrust his face and head entirely under the water, that being the only\r\nway he could drink with his gag on. The gag was taken off when he took\r\nhis food, and then replaced afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM MRS. SOPHIA LITTLE, of Newport, Rhode Island,\r\ndaughter of Hon. Asher Robbins, senator in Congress for that state.\r\n\r\n\"There was lately found, in the hold of a vessel engaged in the\r\nsouthern trade, by a person who was clearing it out, an iron collar,\r\nwith three horns projecting from it. It seems that a young female\r\nslave, on whose slender neck was riveted this fiendish instrument of\r\ntorture, ran away from her tyrant, and begged the captain to bring her\r\noff with him. This the captain refused to do; but unriveted the collar\r\nfrom her neck, and threw it away in the hold of the vessel. The collar\r\nis now at the anti-slavery office, Providence. To the truth of these\r\nfacts Mr. William H. Reed, a gentleman of the highest moral character,\r\nis ready to vouch.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Reed is in possession of many facts of cruelty witnessed by\r\npersons of veracity; but these witnesses are not willing to give their\r\nnames. One case in particular he mentioned. Speaking with a certain\r\ncaptain, of the state of the slaves at the south, the captain\r\ncontended that their punishments were often very _lenient_; and, as an\r\ninstance of their excellent clemency, mentioned, that in one instance,\r\nnot wishing to whip a slave, they sent him to a blacksmith, and had an\r\niron band fastened around him, with three long projections reaching\r\nabove his head; and this he wore some time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM MR. JONATHON F. BALDWIN, of Lorain county,\r\nOhio. Mr. B. was formerly a merchant in Massillon, Ohio, and an elder\r\nin the Presbyterian Church there.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Brother,--In conversation with Judge Lyman, of Litchfield\r\ncounty, Connecticut, last June, he stated to me, that several years\r\nsince he was in Columbia, South Carolina, and observing a colored man\r\nlying on the floor of a blacksmith's shop, as he was passing it, his\r\ncuriosity led him in. He learned the man was a slave and rather\r\nunmanageable. Several men were attempting to detach from his ankle an\r\niron which had been bent around it.\r\n\r\n\"The iron was a piece of a flat bar of the ordinary size from the\r\nforge hammer, and bent around the ankle, the ends meeting, and forming\r\na hoop of about the diameter of the leg. There was one or more strings\r\nattached to the iron and extending up around his neck, evidently so to\r\nsuspend it as to prevent its galling by its weight when at work, yet\r\nit had galled or griped till the leg had swollen out beyond the iron\r\nand inflamed and suppurated, so that the leg for a considerable\r\ndistance above and below the iron, was a mass of putrefaction, the\r\nmost loathsome of any wound he had ever witnessed on any living\r\ncreature. The slave lay on his back on the floor, with his leg on an\r\nanvil which sat also on the floor, one man had a chisel used for\r\nsplitting iron, and another struck it with a sledge, to drive it\r\nbetween the ends of the hoop and separate it so that it might be taken\r\noff. Mr. Lyman said that the man swung the sledge over his shoulders\r\nas if splitting iron, and struck many blows before he succeeded in\r\nparting the ends of the iron at all, the bar was so large and\r\nstubborn--at length they spread it as far as they could without\r\ndriving the chisel so low as to ruin the leg. The slave, a man of\r\ntwenty-five years, perhaps, whose countenance was the index of a mind\r\nill adapted to the degradations of slavery, never uttered a word or a\r\ngroan in all the process, but the copious flow of sweat from every\r\npore, the dreadful contractions and distortions of every muscle in his\r\nbody, showed clearly the great amount of his sufferings; and all this\r\nwhile, such was the diseased state of the limb, that at every blow,\r\nthe bloody, corrupted matter gushed out in all directions several\r\nfeet, in such profusion as literally to cover a large area around the\r\nanvil. After various other fruitless attempts to spread the iron, they\r\nconcluded it was necessary to weaken by filing before it could be got\r\noff which he left them attempting to do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAM DROWN, a well known citizen of Rhode Island, formerly of\r\nProvidence, who has traveled in nearly all the slave states, thus\r\ntestifies in a recent letter:\r\n\r\n\"I recollect seeing large gangs of slaves, generally a considerable\r\nnumber in each gang, being chained, passing westward over the\r\nmountains from Maryland, Virginia, &c. to the Ohio. On that river I\r\nhave frequently seen flat boats loaded with them, and their keepers\r\narmed with pistols and dirks to guard them.\r\n\r\n\"At New Orleans I recollect seeing gangs of slaves that were driven\r\nout every day, the Sabbath not excepted, to work on the streets.\r\nThese had heavy chains to connect two or more together, and some had\r\niron collars and yokes, &c. The noise as they walked, or worked in\r\ntheir chains, was truly dreadful!\"\r\n\r\nRev. THOMAS SAVAGE, pastor of the Congregational Church at Bedford,\r\nNew Hampshire, who was for some years a resident of Mississippi and\r\nLouisiana, gives the following fact, in a letter dated January 9,\r\n1839.\r\n\r\n\"In 1819, while employed as an instructor at Second Creek, near\r\nNatchez, Mississippi, I resided on a plantation where I witnessed the\r\nfollowing circumstance. One of the slaves was in the habit of running\r\naway. He had been repeatedly taken, and repeatedly whipped, with\r\ngreat severity, but to no purpose. He would still seize the first\r\nopportunity to escape from the plantation. At last his owner\r\ndeclared, I'll fix him, I'll put a stop to his running away. He\r\naccordingly took him to a blacksmith, and had an _iron head-frame_\r\nmade for him, which may be called lock-jaw, from the use that was made\r\nof it. It had a lock and key, and was so constructed, that when on the\r\nhead and locked, the slave could not open his mouth to take food, and\r\nthe design was to prevent his running away. But the device proved\r\nunavailing. He was soon missing, and whether by his own desperate\r\neffort, or the aid of others, contrived to sustain himself with food;\r\nbut he was at last taken, and if my memory serves me, his life was\r\nsoon terminated by the cruel treatment to which he was subjected.\"\r\n\r\nThe Western Luminary, a religious paper published at Lexington,\r\nKentucky, in an editorial article, in the summer of 1833, says:\r\n\r\n\"A few weeks since we gave an account of a company of men, women and\r\nchildren, part of whom were manacled, passing through our streets.\r\nLast week, a number of slaves were driven through the main street of\r\nour city, among whom were a number manacled together, two abreast, all\r\nconnected by, and supporting a _heavy iron chain_, which extended the\r\nwhole length of the line.\"\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF A VIRGINIAN.\r\n\r\nThe _name_ of this witness cannot be published, as it would put him in\r\nperil; but his _credibility_ is vouched for by the Rev. Ezra Fisher,\r\npastor of the Baptist Church, Quincy, Illinois, and Dr. Richard Eels,\r\nof the same place. These gentlemen say of him, \"We have great\r\nconfidence in his integrity, discretion, and strict Christian\r\nprinciple.\"  He says--\r\n\r\n\"About five years ago, I remember to have passed, in _a single day_,\r\nfour droves of slaves for the south west; the largest drove had 350\r\nslaves in it, and the smallest upwards of 200. I counted 68 or 70 in\r\na single _coffle_. The '_coffle chain_' is a chain fastened at one\r\nend to the centre of the bar of a pair of hand cuffs, which are\r\nfastened to the right wrist of one, and the left wrist of another\r\nslave, they standing abreast, and the chain between them. These are\r\nthe head of the coffle. The other end is passed through a ring in the\r\nbolt of the next handcuffs, and the slaves being manacled thus, two\r\nand two together, walk up, and the coffle chain is passed, and they go\r\nup towards the head of the coffle. Of course they are closer or wider\r\napart in the coffle, according to the number to be coffled, and to the\r\nlength of the chain. _I have seen HUNDREDS of droves and\r\nchain-coffles of this description_, and every coffle was a scene of\r\nmisery and wo, of tears and brokenness of heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SAMUEL HALL a teacher in Marietta College, Ohio, gives, in a late\r\nletter, the following statement of a fellow student, from Kentucky, of\r\nwhom he says, \"he is a professor of religion, and worthy of entire\r\nconfidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen at least _fifteen_ droves of 'human cattle,' passing by\r\nus on their way to the south; and I do not recollect an exception,\r\nwhere there were not more or less of them _chained_ together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE P.C. HUSSEY, of Fayetteville, Franklin county,\r\nPennsylvania, writes thus:\r\n\r\n\"I was born and raised in Hagerstown, Washington county, Maryland,\r\nwhere slavery is perhaps milder than in any other part of the slave\r\nstates; and yet I have seen _hundreds_ of colored men and women\r\nchained together, two by two, and driven to the south. I have seen\r\nslaves tied up and lashed till the blood ran down to their heels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. GIDDINGS, member of Congress from Ohio, in his speech in the House\r\nof Representatives, Feb. 13, 1839, made the following statement:\r\n\r\n\"On the beautiful avenue in front of the Capitol, members of Congress,\r\nduring this session, have been compelled to turn aside from their\r\npath, to permit a coffle of slaves, males and females, _chained to\r\neach other by their necks_, to pass on their way to this _national\r\nslave market_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTestimony of JAMES K. PAULDING, Esq. the present Secretary of the\r\nUnited States' Navy.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, Mr. Paulding published a work, entitled 'Letters from the\r\nSouth, written during an excursion in the summer of 1816.'  In the\r\nfirst volume of that work, page 128, Mr. P. gives the following\r\ndescription:\r\n\r\n\"The sun was shining out very hot--and in turning the angle of the\r\nroad, we encountered the following group: first, a little cart drawn\r\nby one horse, in which five or six half naked black children were\r\ntumbled like pigs together. The cart had no covering, and they seemed\r\nto have been broiled to sleep. Behind the cart marched three black\r\nwomen, with head, neck and breasts uncovered, and without shoes or\r\nstockings: next came three men, bare-headed, and _chained together\r\nwith an ox-chain_. Last of all, came a white man on horse back,\r\ncarrying his pistols in his belt, and who, as we passed him, had the\r\nimpudence to look us in the face without blushing. At a house where we\r\nstopped a little further on, we learned that he had bought these\r\nmiserable beings in Maryland, and was marching them in this manner to\r\none of the more southern states. Shame on the State of Maryland! and I\r\nsay, shame on the State of Virginia! and every state through which\r\nthis wretched cavalcade was permitted to pass! I do say, that when\r\nthey (the slaveholders) permit such flagrant and indecent outrages\r\nupon humanity as that I have described; when they sanction a villain\r\nin thus marching half naked women and men, loaded with chains, without\r\nbeing charged with any crime but that of being _black_ from one\r\nsection of the United States to another, hundreds of miles in the face\r\nof day, they disgrace themselves, and the country to which they\r\nbelong.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The fact that Mr. Paulding, in the reprint of these\r\n\"Letters,\" in 1835, struck out this passage with all others\r\ndisparaging to slavery and its supporters, does not impair the force\r\nof his testimony, however much it may sink the man. Nor will the next\r\ngeneration regard with any more reverence, his character as a prophet,\r\nbecause in the edition of 1835, two years after the American\r\nAntislavery Society was formed, and when its auxiliaries were numbered\r\nby hundreds, he inserted a _prediction_ that such movements would be\r\nmade at the North, with most disastrous results. \"Wot ye not that such\r\na man as I can certainly divine!\" Mr. Paulding has already been taught\r\nby Judge Jay, that he who aspires to the fame of an oracle, without\r\nits inspiration, must resort to other expedients to prevent detection,\r\nthan the clumsy one of _antedating_ his responses.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. BRANDINGS, MAIMINGS, GUY-SHOT WOUNDS, &c.\r\n\r\nThe slaves are often branded with hot irons, pursued with fire arms\r\nand _shot_, hunted with dogs and torn by them, shockingly maimed with\r\nknives, dirks, &c.; have their ears cut off, their eyes knocked out,\r\ntheir bones dislocated and broken with bludgeons, their fingers and\r\ntoes cut off, their faces and other parts of their persons disfigured\r\nwith scars and gashes, _besides_ those made with the lash.\r\n\r\nWe shall adopt, under this head, the same course as that pursued under\r\nprevious ones,--first give the testimony of the slaveholders\r\nthemselves, to the mutilations, &c. by copying their own graphic\r\ndescriptions of them, in advertisements published under their own\r\nnames, and in newspapers published in the slave states, and,\r\ngenerally, in their own immediate vicinity.

We now\r\nask the reader's attention to the testimonies which follow. They are\r\nendorsed by responsible names--men who 'speak what they know, and\r\ntestify what they have seen'--testimonies which show, that the\r\nslaveholders who wrote the preceding advertisements, describing the\r\nwork of their own hands, in branding with hot irons, maiming,\r\nmutilating, cropping, shooting, knocking out the teeth and eyes of\r\ntheir slaves, breaking their bones, &c., have manifested, _as far as\r\nthey have gone_ in the description, a commendable fidelity to truth.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some of the scars and maimings in the preceding\r\nadvertisements were the result of accidents; and some _may be_ the\r\nresult of violence inflicted by the slaves upon each other. Without\r\narguing that point, we say, these are the _facts_; whoever reads and\r\nponders them, will need no argument to convince him, that the\r\nproposition which they have been employed to sustain, _cannot be\r\nshaken_. That any considerable portion of them were _accidental_, is\r\ntotally improbable, from the nature of the case; and is in most\r\ninstances disproved by the advertisements themselves. That they have\r\nnot been produced by assaults of the slaves upon each other, is\r\nmanifest from the fact, that injuries of that character inflicted by\r\nthe slaves upon each other, are, as all who are familiar with the\r\nhabits and condition of slaves well know, exceedingly rare; and of\r\nnecessity must be so, from the constant action upon them of the\r\nstrongest dissuasives from such acts that can operate on human nature.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements similar to the preceding may at any time be gathered by\r\nscores from the daily and weekly newspapers of the slave states.\r\nBefore presenting the reader with further testimony in proof of the\r\nproposition at the head of this part of our subject, we remark, that\r\nsome of the tortures enumerated under this and the preceding heads,\r\nare not in all cases inflicted by slaveholders as _punishments_, but\r\nsometimes merely as preventives of escape, for the greater security of\r\ntheir 'property'. Iron collars, chains, &c. are put upon slaves when\r\nthey are driven or transported from one part of the country to\r\nanother, in order to keep them from running away. Similar measures are\r\noften resorted to upon plantations. When the master or owner suspects\r\na slave of plotting an escape, an iron collar with long 'horns,' or a\r\nbar of iron, or a ball and chain, are often fastened upon him, for the\r\ndouble purpose of retarding his flight, should he attempt it, and of\r\nserving as an easy means of detection.\r\n\r\nAnother inhuman method of _marking_ slaves, so that they may be easily\r\ndescribed and detected when they escape, is called _cropping_. In the\r\npreceding advertisements, the reader will perceive a number of cases,\r\nin which the runaway is described as '_cropt_,' or a '_notch cut_ in\r\nthe ear, or a part or the whole of the ear _cut off_,' &c.\r\n\r\nTwo years and a half since, the writer of this saw a letter, then just\r\nreceived by Mr. Lewis Tappan, of New York, containing a negro's ear\r\ncut off close to the head. The writer of the letter, who signed\r\nhimself Thomas Oglethorpe, Montgomery, Alabama, sent it to Mr. Tappan\r\nas 'a specimen of a negro's ears,' and desired him to add it to his\r\n'collection.'\r\n\r\nAnother method of _marking_ slaves, is by drawing out or breaking off\r\none or two _front teeth_--commonly the upper ones, as the mark would\r\nin that case be the more obvious. An instance of this kind the reader\r\nwill recall in the testimony of Sarah M. Grimké, page 30, and of which\r\nshe had _personal_ knowledge; being well acquainted both with the\r\ninhuman master, (a distinguished citizen of South Carolina,) by whose\r\norder the brutal deed was done, and with the poor young girl whose\r\nmouth was thus barbarously mutilated, to furnish a convenient mark by\r\nwhich to describe her in case of her elopement, as she had frequently\r\nrun away.\r\n\r\nThe case stated by Miss G. serves to unravel what, to one uninitiated,\r\nseems quite a mystery: i.e. the frequency with which, in the\r\nadvertisements of runaway slaves published in southern papers, they\r\nare described as having _one or two front teeth out_. Scores of such\r\nadvertisements are in southern papers now on our table. We will\r\nfurnish the reader with a dozen or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nJesse Debruhl, sheriff, Richland District, \"Columbia (S.C.)\r\nTelescope,\" Feb. 24, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"Committed to jail, Ned, about 25 years of age, has lost his _two\r\nupper front teeth_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. John Hunt, Black Water Bay, \"Pensacola (Ga.)

The reader will remark that all the slaves, whose ages are\r\ngiven, are _young_--not one has arrived at middle age; consequently it\r\ncan hardly be supposed that they have lost their teeth either from age\r\nor decay. The probability that their teeth were taken out by force, is\r\nincreased by the fact of their being _front teeth_ in almost every\r\ncase, and from the fact that the loss of no _other_ is mentioned in\r\nthe advertisements. It is well known that the front teeth are not\r\ngenerally the first to fail. Further, it is notorious that the teeth\r\nof the slaves are remarkably sound and serviceable, that they decay\r\nfar less, and at a much later period of life than the teeth of the\r\nwhites: owing partly, no doubt, to original constitution; but more\r\nprobably to their diet, habits, and mode of life.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the horrible mutilations _sometimes_ suffered by\r\nthem in the breaking and tearing out of their teeth, we insert the\r\nfollowing, from the New Orleans Bee of May 31, 1837.\r\n\r\n$10 REWARD.--Ranaway, Friday, May 12, JULIA, a negress, EIGHTEEN OR\r\nTWENTY YEARS OLD.

RIPLEY, Esq. of Norwich, Connecticut, has furnished the\r\nfollowing statement, in a letter dated Dec. 12, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"GURDON CHAPMAN, Esq., a respectable merchant of our city, one of our\r\ncounty commissioners,--last spring a member of our state\r\nlegislature,--and whose character for veracity is above suspicion,\r\nabout a year since visited the county of Nansemond, Virginia, for the\r\npurpose of buying a cargo of corn. He purchased a large quantity of\r\nMr. ----, with whose family he spent a week or ten days; after he\r\nreturned, he related to me and several other citizens the following\r\nfacts. In order to prepare the corn for market by the time agreed\r\nupon, the slaves were worked as hard as they would bear, from daybreak\r\nuntil 9 or 10 o'clock at night. They were called directly from their\r\nbunks in the morning to their work, without a morsel of food until\r\nnoon, when they took their breakfast and dinner, consisting of bacon\r\nand corn bread. The quantity of meat was not one tenth of what the\r\nsame number of northern laborers usually have at a meal. They were\r\nallowed but fifteen minutes to take this meal, at the expiration of\r\nthis time the horn was blown. The rigor with which they enforce\r\npunctuality to its call, may be imagined from the fact, that a little\r\nboy only nine years old was whipped so severely by the driver, that in\r\nmany places the whip cut through his clothes (which were of cotton,)\r\nfor tardiness of not over three minutes. They then worked without\r\nintermission until 9 or 10 at night; after which they prepared and ate\r\ntheir second meal, as scanty as the first. An aged slave, who was\r\nremarkable for his industry and fidelity, was working with all his\r\nmight on the threshing floor; amidst the clatter of the shelling and\r\nwinnowing machines the master spoke to him, but he did not hear; he\r\npresently gave him several severe cuts with the raw hide, saying, at\r\nthe same time, 'damn you, if you cannot hear I'll see if you can\r\nfeel.' One morning the master rose from breakfast and whipped most\r\ncruelly, with a raw hide, a nice girl who was waiting on the table,\r\nfor not opening a _west_ window when he had told her to open an east\r\none. The number of slaves was only forty, and yet the lash was in\r\nconstant use. The bodies of all of them were literally covered with\r\nold scars.\r\n\r\n\"Not one of the slaves attended church on the Sabbath. The social\r\nrelations were scarcely recognised among them, and they lived in a\r\nstate of promiscuous concubinage. The master said he took pains to\r\nbreed from his best stock--the whiter the progeny the higher they\r\nwould sell for house servants. When asked by Mr. C. if he did not fear\r\nhis slaves would run away if he whipped them so much, he replied, they\r\nknow too well what they must suffer if they are taken--and then said,\r\n'I'll tell you how I treat my runaway niggers. I had a big nigger that\r\nran away the second time; as soon as I got track of him I took three\r\ngood fellows and went in pursuit, and found him in the night, some\r\nmiles distant, in a corn-house; we took him and ironed him hand and\r\nfoot, and carted him home. The next morning we tied him to a tree, and\r\nwhipped him until there was not a sound place on his back. I then tied\r\nhis ankles and hoisted him up to a _limb_--feet up and head down--we\r\nthen whipped him, until the damned nigger smoked so that I thought he\r\nwould take fire and burn up. We then took him down; and to make sure\r\nthat he should not run away the third time, I run my knife in back of\r\nthe ankles, and _cut off the large cords_,--and then I ought to have\r\nput some lead into the wounds, but I forgot it'\r\n\r\n\"The truth of the above is from unquestionable authority; and you may\r\npublish or suppress it, as shall best subserve the cause of God and\r\nhumanity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM STEPHAN SEWALL, Esq., Winthrop, Maine, dated\r\nJan. 12th, 1839. Mr. S. is a member of the Congregational church in\r\nWinthrop, and late agent of the Winthrop Manufacturing company.\r\n\r\n\"Being somewhat acquainted with slavery, by a residence of about five\r\nyears in Alabama, and having witnessed many acts of slaveholding\r\ncruelty, I will mention one or two that came under my eye; and one of\r\nexcessive cruelty mentioned to me at the time, by the gentleman (now\r\ndead,) that interfered in behalf of the slave.\r\n\r\n\"I was witness to such cruelties by an overseer to a slave, that he\r\ntwice attempted to drown himself, to get out of his power: this was on\r\na raft of slaves, in the Mobile river. I saw an owner take his runaway\r\nslave, tie a rope round him, then get on his horse, give the slave and\r\nhorse a cut the whip, and run the poor creature barefooted, very fast,\r\nover rough ground, where small black jack oaks had been cut up,\r\nleaving the sharp stumps, on which the slave would frequently fall;\r\nthen the master would drag him as long as he could himself hold out;\r\nthen stop, and whip him up on his feet again--then proceed as before.\r\nThis continued until he got out of my sight, which was about half a\r\nmile. But what further cruelties this wretched man, (whose passion was\r\nso excited that he could scarcely utter a word when he took the slave\r\ninto his own power,) inflicted upon his poor victim, the day of\r\njudgment will unfold.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen slaves severely whipped on plantations, but this _is an\r\nevery day occurrence_, and comes under the head of general treatment.\r\n\r\n\"I have known the case of a husband compelled to whip his wife. This I\r\ndid not witness, though not two rods from the cabin at the time.\r\n\r\n\"I will now mention the case of cruelty before referred to. In 1820 or\r\n21, while the public works were going forward on Dauphin Island,\r\nMobile Bay, a contractor, engaged on the works, beat one of his slaves\r\nso severely that the poor creature had no longer power to writhe under\r\nhis suffering: he then took out his knife, and began to _cut his flesh\r\nin strips, from his hips down_. At this moment, the gentleman referred\r\nto, who was also a contractor, shocked at such inhumanity, stepped\r\nforward, between the wretch and his victim, and exclaimed, 'If you\r\ntouch that slave again you do it at the peril of your life.' The\r\nslaveholder raved at him for interfering between him and his slave;\r\nbut he was obliged to drop his victim, fearing the arm of my\r\nfriend--whose stature and physical powers were extraordinary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM MRS. MARY COWLES, a member of the\r\nPresbyterian church at Geneva, Ashtabula county, Ohio, dated 12th, mo.\r\n18th, 1838. Mrs. Cowles is a daughter of Mr. James Colwell of Brook\r\ncounty, Virginia, near West Liberty.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1809, I think, when I was twenty-one years old, a man in\r\nthe vicinity where I resided, in Brooke co. Va. near West Liberty, by\r\nthe name of Morgan, had a little slave girl about six years old, who\r\nhad a habit or rather a natural infirmity common to children of that\r\nage. On this account her master and mistress would pinch her ears with\r\nhot tongs, and throw hot embers on her legs. Not being able to\r\naccomplish their object by these means, they at last resorted to a\r\nmethod too indelicate, and too horrible to describe in detail. Suffice\r\nit to say, it soon put an end to her life in the most excruciating\r\nmanner. If further testimony to authenticate what I have stated is\r\nnecessary, I refer you to Dr. Robert Mitchel who then resided in the\r\nvicinity, but now lives at Indiana, Pennsylvania, above Pittsburgh.\"\r\n\r\nMARY COWLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WILLIAM LADD, Esq., now of Minot, Maine, formerly a\r\nslaveholder in Florida. Mr. Ladd is now the President of the American\r\nPeace Society. In a letter dated November 29, 1838, Mr. Ladd says:\r\n\r\n\"While I lived in Florida I knew a slaveholder whose name was\r\nHutchinson, he had been a preacher and a member of the Senate of\r\nGeorgia. He told me that he dared not keep a gun in his house, because\r\nhe was so passionate; and that he had _been the death of three or four\r\nmen_. I understood him to mean _slaves_. One of his slaves, a girl,\r\nonce came to my house. She had run away from him at Indian river. The\r\ncords of one of her hands were so much contracted that her hand was\r\nuseless. It was said that he had thrust her hand into the fire while\r\nhe was in a fit of passion, and held it there, and this was the\r\neffect. My wife had hid the girl, when Hutchinson came for her. Out of\r\ncompassion for the poor slave, I offered him more than she was worth,\r\nwhich he refused. We afterward let the girl escape, and I do not know\r\nwhat became of her, but I believe he never got her again. It was\r\ncurrently reported of Hutchinson, that he once knocked down a _new_\r\nnegro (one recently from Africa) who was clearing up land, and who\r\ncomplained of the cold, as it was mid-winter. The slave was stunned\r\nwith the blow. Hutchinson, supposing he had the 'sulks,' applied fire\r\nto the side of the slave until it was so roasted that he said the\r\nslave was not worth curing, and ordered the other slaves to pile on\r\nbrush, and he was consumed.\r\n\r\n\"A murder occurred at the settlement, (Musquito) while I lived there.\r\nAn overseer from Georgia, who was employed by a Mr. Cormick, in a fit\r\nof jealousy shot a slave of Samuel Williams, the owner of the next\r\nplantation. He was apprehended, but afterward suffered to escape. This\r\nman told me that he had rather whip a negro than sit down to the best\r\ndinner. This man had, near his house, a contrivance like that which is\r\nused in armies where soldiers are punished with the picket; by this\r\nthe slave was drawn up from the earth, by a cord passing round his\r\nwrists, so that his feet could just touch the ground. It somewhat\r\nresembled a New England well sweep, and was used when the slaves were\r\nflogged.\r\n\r\n\"The treatment of slaves at Musquito I consider much milder than that\r\nwhich I have witnessed in the United States. Florida was under the\r\nSpanish government while I lived there. There were about fifteen or\r\ntwenty plantations at Musquito. I have an indistinct recollection of\r\nfour or five slaves dying of the cold in Amelia Island. They belonged\r\nto Mr. Bunce of musquito. The compensation of the overseers was a\r\ncertain portion of the crop.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGERRIT SMITH, Esq. of Peterboro, in a letter, dated Dec. 15, 1838,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"I have just been conversing with an inhabitant of this town, on the\r\nsubject of the cruelties of slavery. My neighbors inform me that he is\r\na man of veracity. The candid manner of his communication utterly\r\nforbade the suspicion that he was attempting to deceive me.\r\n\r\n\"My informant says that he resided in Louisiana and Alabama during a\r\ngreat part of the years 1819 and 1820:--that he frequently saw slaves\r\nwhipped, never saw any killed; but often heard of their being\r\nkilled:--that in several instances he had seen a slave receive, in the\r\nspace of two hours, five hundred lashes--each stroke drawing blood. He\r\nadds that this severe whipping was always followed by the application\r\nof strong brine to the lacerated parts.\r\n\r\n\"My informant further says, that in the spring of 1819, he steered a\r\nboat from Louisville to New Orleans. Whilst stopping at a plantation\r\non the east bank of the Mississippi, between Natchez and New Orleans,\r\nfor the purpose of making sale of some of the articles with which the\r\nboat was freighted, he and his fellow boatmen saw a shockingly cruel\r\npunishment inflicted on a couple of slaves for the repeated offence of\r\nrunning away. Straw was spread over the whole of their backs, and,\r\nafter being fastened by a band of the same material, was ignited, and\r\nleft to burn, until entirely consumed. The agonies and screams of the\r\nsufferers he can never forget.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. DAVID NELSON, late president of Marion College, Missouri, a native\r\nof Tennessee, and till forty years old a slaveholder, said in an\r\nAnti-Slavery address at Northampton, Mass. Jan. 1839--\r\n\r\n\"I have not attempted to harrow your feelings with stories of cruelty.\r\nI will, however, mention one or two among the many incidents that came\r\nunder my observation as family physician. I was one day dressing a\r\nblister, and the mistress of the house sent a little black girl into\r\nthe kitchen to bring me some warm water. She probably mistook her\r\nmessage; for she returned with a bowl full of boiling water; which her\r\nmistress no sooner perceived, than she thrust her hand into it, and\r\nheld it there till it was half cooked.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY H. LOOMIS, a member of the Presbyterian Theological Seminary\r\nin the city of New York, says, in a recent letter--\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Mr. Hart, recently my pastor, in Otsego county, New York,\r\nand who has spent some time at the south as a teacher, stated to me\r\nthat in the neighborhood in which he resided a slave was set to watch\r\na turnip patch near an academy, in order to keep off the boys who\r\noccasionally trespassed on it. Attempting to repeat the trespass in\r\npresence of the slave, they were told that his 'master forbad it.' At\r\nthis the boys were enraged, and hurled brickbats at the slave until\r\nhis face and other parts were much injured and wounded--but nothing\r\nwas said or done about it as an injury to the slave.\r\n\r\n\"He also said, that a slave from the same neighborhood was found out\r\nin the woods, with his arms and legs burned almost to a cinder, up as\r\nfar as the elbow and knee joints; and there appeared to be but little\r\nmore said or thought about it than if he had been a brute. It was\r\nsupposed that his master was the cause of it--making him an example of\r\npunishment to the rest of the gang!\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract of a letter dated March 5, 1839, from Mr.\r\nJOHN CLARKE, a highly respected citizen of Scriba, Oswego county, New\r\nYork, and a member of the Presbyterian church.\r\n\r\nThe 'Mrs. Turner' spoken of in Mr. C.'s letter, is the wife of Hon.\r\nFielding S. Turner, who in 1803 resided at Lexington, Kentucky, and\r\nwas the attorney for the Commonwealth. Soon after that, he removed to\r\nNew Orleans, and was for many years Judge of the Criminal Court of\r\nthat city. Having amassed an immense fortune, he returned to Lexington\r\na few years since, and still resides there. Mr. C. the writer, spent\r\nthe winter of 1836-7 in Lexington. He says,\r\n\r\n\"Yours of the 27th ult. is received, and I hasten to state the facts\r\nwhich came to my knowledge while in Lexington, respecting the\r\noccurrences about which you inquire. Mrs. Turner was originally a\r\nBoston lady. She is from 35 to 40 years of age, and the wife of Judge\r\nTurner, formerly of New Orleans, and worth a large fortune in slaves\r\nand plantations. I repeatedly heard, while in Lexington, Kentucky,\r\nduring the winter of 1836-7, of the wanton cruelty practised by this\r\nwoman upon her slaves, and that she had caused several to be _whipped\r\nto death_; but I never heard that she was suspected of being deranged,\r\notherwise than by the indulgence of an ungoverned temper, until I\r\nheard that her husband was attempting to incarcerate her in the\r\nLunatic Asylum. The citizens of Lexington, believing the charge to be\r\na false one, rose and prevented the accomplishment for a time, until,\r\nlulled by the fair promises of his friends, they left his domicil, and\r\nin the dead of night she was taken by force, and conveyed to the\r\nasylum. This proceeding being judged illegal by her friends, a suit\r\nwas instituted to liberate her. I heard the testimony on the trial,\r\nwhich related only to proceedings had in order to getting her admitted\r\ninto the asylum; and no facts came out relative to her treatment of\r\nher slaves, other than of a general character.\r\n\r\n\"Some days after the above trial, (which by the way did not come to an\r\nultimate decision, as I believe) I was present in my brother's office,\r\nwhen Judge Turner, in a long conversation with my brother on the\r\nsubject of his trials with his wife, said, '_That woman has been the\r\nimmediate cause of the death of_ six _of my servants, by her\r\nseverities_!\r\n\r\n\"I was repeatedly told, while I was there, that she drove a colored\r\nboy from the second story window, a distance of 15 to 18 feet, on to\r\nthe pavement, which made him a cripple for a time.\r\n\r\n\"I heard the trial of a man for the murder of his slave, by whipping,\r\nwhere the evidence was to my mind perfectly conclusive of his guilt;\r\nbut the jury were two of them for convicting him of manslaughter, and\r\nthe rest for acquitting him; and as they could not agree were\r\ndischarged--and on a subsequent trial, as I learned by the papers, the\r\nculprit was acquitted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. THOMAS SAVAGE, of Bedford, New Hampshire, in a recent letter,\r\nstates the following fact:\r\n\r\n\"The following circumstance was related to me last summer, by my\r\nbrother, now residing as a physician, at Rodney, Mississippi; and who,\r\nthough a pro-slavery man, spoke of it in terms of reprobation, as an\r\nact of capricious, wanton cruelty. The planter who was the actor in it\r\nI myself knew; and the whole transaction is so characteristic of the\r\nman, that, independent of the strong authority I have, I should\r\nentertain but little doubt of its authenticity. He is a wealthy\r\nplanter, residing near Natchez, eccentric, capricious and intemperate.\r\nOn one occasion he invited a number of guests to an elegant\r\nentertainment, prepared in the true style of southern luxury. From\r\nsome cause, none of the guests appeared. In a moody humor, and under\r\nthe influence, probably, of mortified pride, he ordered the overseer\r\nto call the people (a term by which the field hands are generally\r\ndesignated,) on to the piazza. The order was obeyed, and the people\r\ncame. 'Now,' said he, 'have them seated at the table. Accordingly they\r\nwere seated at the well-furnished, glittering table, while he and his\r\noverseer waited on them, and helped them to the various dainties of\r\nthe feast. 'Now,' said he, after awhile, raising his voice, 'take\r\nthese rascals, and give them twenty lashes a piece. I'll show them how\r\nto eat at my table.' The overseer, in relating it, said he had to\r\ncomply, though reluctantly, with this brutal command.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY P. THOMPSON, a native and still a resident of Nicholasville,\r\nKentucky, made the following statement at a public meeting in Lane\r\nSeminary, Ohio, in 1833. He was at that time a slaveholder.\r\n\r\n\"_Cruelties_, said he, _are so common_, I hardly know what to relate.\r\nBut one fact occurs to me just at this time, that happened in the\r\nvillage where I live. The circumstances are these. A colored man, a\r\nslave, ran away. As he was crossing Kentucky river, a white man, who\r\nsuspected him, attempted to stop him. The negro resisted. The white\r\nman procured help, and finally succeeded in securing him. He then\r\nwreaked his vengeance on him for resisting--flogging him till he was\r\nnot able to walk. They then put him on a horse, and came on with him\r\nten miles to Nicholasville. When they entered the village, it was\r\nnoticed that he sat upon his horse like a drunken man. It was a very\r\nhot day; and whilst they were taking some refreshment, the negro sat\r\ndown upon the ground, under the shade. When they ordered him to go, he\r\nmade several efforts before he could get up; and when he attempted to\r\nmount the horse, his strength was entirely insufficient. One of the\r\nmen struck him, and with an oath ordered him to get on the horse\r\nwithout any more fuss. The negro staggered back a few steps, fell\r\ndown, and died. I do not know that any notice was ever taken of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. COLEMAN S. HODGES, a native and still a resident of Western\r\nVirginia, gave the following testimony at the same meeting.\r\n\r\n\"I have frequently seen the mistress of a family in Virginia, with\r\nwhom I was well acquainted, beat the woman who performed the kitchen\r\nwork, with a stick two feet and a half long, and nearly as thick as my\r\nwrist; striking her over the head, and across the small of the back,\r\nas she was bent over at her work, with as much spite as you would a\r\nsnake, and for what I should consider no offence at all. There lived\r\nin this same family a young man, a slave, who was in the habit of\r\nrunning away. He returned one time after a week's absence. The master\r\ntook him into the barn, stripped him entirely naked, tied him up by\r\nhis hands so high that he could not reach the floor, tied his feet\r\ntogether, and put a small rail between his legs, so that he could not\r\navoid the blows, and commenced whipping him. He told me that he gave\r\nhim five hundred lashes. At any rate, he was covered with wounds from\r\nhead to foot. Not a place as big as my hand but what was cut. Such\r\nthings as these are perfectly common all over Virginia; at least so\r\nfar as I am acquainted. Generally, planters avoid punishing their\r\nslaves before strangers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. CALVIN H. TATE, of Missouri, whose father and brothers were\r\nslaveholders, related the following at the same meeting. The\r\nplantation on which it occurred, was in the immediate neighborhood of\r\nhis father's.\r\n\r\n\"A young woman, who was generally very badly treated, after receiving\r\na more severe whipping than usual, ran away. In a few days she came\r\nback, and was sent into the field to work. At this time the garment\r\nnext her skin was stiff like a scab, from the running of the sores\r\nmade by the whipping. Towards night, she told her master that she was\r\nsick, and wished to go to the house. She went, and as soon as she\r\nreached it, laid down on the floor exhausted. The mistress asked her\r\nwhat the matter was? She made no reply. She asked again; but received\r\nno answer. 'I'll see,' said she, 'if I can't make you speak.' So\r\ntaking the tongs, she heated them red hot, and put them upon the\r\nbottoms of her feet; then upon her legs and body; and, finally, in a\r\nrage, took hold of her throat. This had the desired effect. The poor\r\ngirl faintly whispered, 'Oh, misse, don't--I am most gone;' and\r\nexpired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract of a letter from Rev. C.S. RENSHAW, pastor of the\r\nCongregational Church, Quincy, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Menzies of Boone county, Kentucky, an elder in the Presbyterian\r\nChurch, and a slaveholder, told me that _he knew_ some overseers in\r\nthe tobacco growing region of Virginia, who, to make their slaves\r\ncareful in picking the tobacco, that is taking the worms off; (you\r\nknow what a loathsome thing the tobacco worm is) would make them _eat_\r\nsome of the worms, and others who made them eat every worm they missed\r\nin picking.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. NANCY JUDD, a member of the Non-Conformist Church in Osnaburg,\r\nStark county, Ohio, and formerly a resident of Kentucky, testifies\r\nthat she knew a slaveholder,\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Brubecker, who had a number of slaves, among whom was one who\r\nwould frequently avoid labor by hiding himself; for which he would get\r\nsevere floggings without the desired effect, and that at last Mr. B.\r\nwould tie large cats on his naked body and whip them to make them tear\r\nhis back, in order to break him of his habit of hiding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. HORACE MOULTON, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church in\r\nMarlborough, Massachusetts, says:\r\n\r\n\"Some, when other modes of punishment will not subdue them, _cat-haul_\r\nthem; that is, take a cat by the nape of the neck and tail, or by its\r\nhind legs, and drag the claws across the back until satisfied; this\r\nkind of punishment, as I have understood, poisons the flesh much worse\r\nthan the whip, and is more dreaded by the slave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. ABEL BROWN, Jr. late pastor of the first Baptist Church, Beaver,\r\nPennsylvania, in a communication to Rev. C.P. Grosvenor, Editor of\r\nthe Christian Reflector, says:\r\n\r\n\"I almost daily see the poor heart-broken slave making his way to a\r\nland of freedom. A short time since, I saw a noble, pious, distressed,\r\nspirit-crushed slave, a member of the Baptist church, escaping from a\r\n(professed Christian) bloodhound, to a land where he could enjoy that\r\nof which he had been robbed during forty years. His prayers would have\r\nmade us all feel. I saw a Baptist sister of about the same age, her\r\nchildren had been torn from her, her head was covered with fresh\r\nwounds, while her upper lip had scarcely ceased to bleed, in\r\nconsequence of a blow with the poker, which knocked out her teeth; she\r\ntoo, was going to a land of freedom. Only a very few days since, I saw\r\na girl of about eighteen, with a child as white as myself, aged ten\r\nmonths; a Christian master was raising her child (as well his own\r\nperhaps) to sell to a southern market. She had heard of the\r\nintention, and at midnight took her only treasure and traveled twenty\r\nmiles on foot through a land of strangers--she found friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. HENRY T. HOPKINS, pastor of the Primitive Methodist Church in New\r\nYork City, who resided in Virginia from 1821 to 1826, relates the\r\nfollowing fact:\r\n\r\n\"An old colored man, the slave of Mr. Emerson; of Portsmouth,\r\nVirginia, being under deep conviction for sin, went into the back part\r\nof his master's garden to pour out his soul in prayer to God. For this\r\noffence he was whipped thirty-nine lashes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract of a letter from DOCTOR F. JULIUS LEMOYNE, of Washington,\r\nPennsylvania, dated Jan. 9, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"Lest you should not have seen the statement to which I am going to\r\nallude, I subjoin a brief outline of the facts of a transaction which\r\noccurred in Western Virginia, adjacent to this county, a number of\r\nyears ago--a full account of which was published in the \"Witness\"\r\nabout two years since by Dr. Mitchell, who now resides in Indiana\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania. A slave boy ran away in cold weather, and during\r\nhis concealment had his legs frozen; he returned, or was retaken.\r\nAfter some time the flesh decayed and _sloughed_--of course was\r\noffensive--he was carried out to a field and left there without bed,\r\nor shelter, _deserted to die_. His only companions were the house dogs\r\nwhich he called to him. After several days and nights spent in\r\nsuffering and exposure, he was visited by Drs. McKitchen and Mitchell\r\nin the field, of their own accord, having heard by report of his\r\nlamentable condition; they remonstrated with the master; brought the\r\nboy to the house, amputated both legs, and he finally recovered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. JAMES K. PAULDING, the Secretary of the Navy of the U. States, in\r\nhis \"Letters from the South\" published in 1817, relates the following:\r\n\r\n\"At one of the taverns along the road we were set down in the same\r\nroom with an elderly man and a youth who seemed to be well acquainted\r\nwith him, for they conversed familiarly and with true republican\r\nindependence--for they did not mind who heard them. From the tenor of\r\nhis conversation I was induced to look particularly at the elder. He\r\nwas telling the youth something like the following detested tale. He\r\nwas going, it seems, to Richmond, to inquire about a draft for seven\r\nthousand dollars, which he had sent by mail, but which, not having\r\nbeen acknowledged by his correspondent, he was afraid had been stolen,\r\nand the money received by the thief. 'I should not like to lose it,'\r\nsaid he, 'for I worked hard for it, and sold many a poor d----l of a\r\nblack to Carolina and Georgia, to scrape it together.' He then went on\r\nto tell many a perfidious tale. All along the road it seems he made it\r\nhis business to inquire where lived a man who might be tempted to\r\nbecome a party in this accursed traffic, and when he had got some half\r\ndozen of these poor creatures, _he tied their hands behind their\r\nbacks_, and drove them three or four hundred miles or more,\r\nbare-headed and half naked through the burning southern sun. Fearful\r\nthat _even southern humanity_ would revolt at such an exhibition of\r\nhuman misery and human barbarity, he gave out that they were runaway\r\nslaves he was carrying home to their masters. On one occasion a poor\r\nblack woman exposed this fallacy, and told the story of her being\r\n_kidnapped_, and when he got her into a wood out of hearing, he beat\r\nher, to use his own expression, 'till her back was white.' It seems he\r\nmarried all the men and women he bought, himself, because they would\r\nsell better for being man and wife! But, said the youth, were you not\r\nafraid, in traveling through the wild country and sleeping in lone\r\nhouses, these slaves would rise and kill you? 'To be sure I was,' said\r\nthe other, 'but I always fastened my door, put a chair on a table\r\nbefore it, so that it might wake me in falling, and slept with a\r\nloaded pistol in each hand. It was a bad life, and I left it off as\r\nsoon as I could live without it; for many is the time I have separated\r\nwives from husbands, and husbands from wives, and parents from\r\nchildren, but then I made them amends by marrying them again as soon\r\nas I had a chance, that is to say, I made them call each other man and\r\nwife, and sleep together, which is quite enough for negroes. I made\r\none bad purchase though,' continued he. 'I bought a young mulatto\r\ngirl, a lively creature, a great bargain. She had been the favorite of\r\nher master, who had lately married. The difficulty was to get her to\r\ngo, for the poor creature loved her master. However, I swore most\r\nbitterly I was only going to take to take her to her mother's at ----\r\nand she went with me, though she seemed to doubt me very much. But\r\nwhen she discovered, at last, that we were out of the state, I thought\r\nshe would go mad, and in fact, the next night she drowned herself in\r\nthe river close by. I lost a good five hundred dollars by this foolish\r\ntrick.'\" Vol. I. p. 121.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. ---- SPILLMAN, a native, and till recently, a resident of\r\nVirginia, now a member of the Presbyterian church in Delhi, Hamilton\r\nco., Ohio, has furnished the two following facts, of which he had\r\npersonal knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"David Stallard, of Shenandoah co., Virginia, had a slave, who run\r\naway; he was taken up and lodged in Woodstock jail. Stallard went with\r\nanother man and took him out of the jail--tied him to their\r\nhorses--and started for home. The day was excessively hot, and they\r\nrode so fast, dragging the man by the rope behind them, that he became\r\nperfectly exhausted--fainted--dropped down, and died.\r\n\r\n\"Henry Jones, of Culpepper co., Virginia, owned a slave, who ran away.\r\nJones caught him, tied him up, and for two days, at intervals,\r\ncontinued to flog him, and rub salt into his mangled flesh, until his\r\nback was literally cut up. The slave sunk under the torture; and for\r\nsome days it was supposed he must die. He, however, slowly recovered;\r\nthough it was some weeks before he could walk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. NATHAN COLE, of St. Louis, Missouri, in a letter to Mr. Arthur\r\nTappan, of New-York, dated July 2, 1834, says,--\r\n\r\n\"You will find inclosed an account of the proceedings of an inquest\r\nlately held in this city upon the body of a slave, the details of\r\nwhich, if published, not one in ten could be induced to believe\r\ntrue.[11] It appears that the master or mistress, or both, suspected\r\nthe unfortunate wretch of hiding a bunch of keys which were missing;\r\nand to extort some explanation, which, it is more than probable, the\r\nslave was as unable to do as her mistress, or any other person, her\r\nmaster, Major Harney, an officer of our army, had whipped her for\r\nthree successive days, and it is supposed by some, that she was kept\r\ntied during the time, until her flesh was so lacerated and torn that\r\nit was impossible for the jury to say whether it had been done with a\r\nwhip or hot iron; some think both--but she was tortured to death. It\r\nappears also that the husband of the said slave had become suspected\r\nof telling some neighbor of what was going on, for which Major Harney\r\ncommenced torturing him, until the man broke from him, and ran into\r\nthe Mississippi and drowned himself. The man was a pious and very\r\nindustrious slave, perhaps not surpassed by any in this place. The\r\nwoman has been in the family of John Shackford, Esq., the present\r\ndoorkeeper of the Senate of the United States, for many years; was\r\nconsidered an excellent servant--was the mother of a number of\r\nchildren--and I believe was sold into the family where she met her\r\nfate, as matter of conscience, to keep her from being sent below.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The following is the newspaper notice referred to:--\r\n\r\nAn inquest was held at the dwelling house of Major Harney, in this\r\ncity, on the 27th inst. by the coroner, on the body of Hannah, a\r\nslave. The jury, on their oaths, and after hearing the testimony of\r\nphysicians and several other witnesses, found, that said slave \"came\r\nto her death by wounds inflicted by William S. Harney.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. EZEKIEL BIRDSEYE, a highly respected citizen of Cornwall,\r\nLitchfield co., Connecticut, who resided for many years at the south,\r\nfurnished to the Rev. E. R. Tyler, editor of the Connecticut Observer,\r\nthe following personal testimony.\r\n\r\n\"While I lived in Limestone co., Alabama, in 1826-7, a tavern-keeper\r\nof the village of Moresville discovered a negro carrying away a piece\r\nof old carpet. It was during the Christmas holidays, when the slaves\r\nare allowed to visit their friends. The negro stated that one of the\r\nservants of the tavern owed him some twelve and a half or twenty-five\r\ncents, and that he had taken the carpet in payment. This the servant\r\ndenied. The innkeeper took the negro to a field near by, and whipped\r\nhim cruelly. He then struck him with a stake, and punched him in the\r\nface and mouth, knocking out some of his teeth. After this, he took\r\nhim back to the house, and committed him to the care of his son, who\r\nhad just then come home with another young man. This was at evening.\r\nThey whipped him by turns, with heavy cowskins, and made the _dogs\r\nshake him_. A Mr. Phillips, who lodged at the house, heard the cruelty\r\nduring the night. On getting up he found the negro in the bar-room,\r\nterribly mangled with the whip, and his flesh so torn by the dogs,\r\nthat the cords were bare. He remarked to the landlord that he was\r\ndangerously hurt, and needed care. The landlord replied that he\r\ndeserved none. Mr. Phillips went to a neighboring magistrate, who took\r\nthe slave home with him, where he soon died. The father and son were\r\nboth tried, and acquitted!! A suit was brought, however, for damages\r\nin behalf of the owner of the slave, a young lady by the name of Agnes\r\nJones. _I was on the jury when these facts were stated on oath_. Two\r\nmen testified, one that he would have given $1000 for him, the other\r\n$900 or $950. The jury found the latter sum.\r\n\r\n\"At Union Court House, S.C., a tavern-keeper, by the name of Samuel\r\nDavis, procured the conviction and execution of his own slave, for\r\nstealing a cake of gingerbread from a grog shop. The slave raised the\r\nlatch of the back door, and took the cake, doing no other injury. The\r\nshop keeper, whose name was Charles Gordon, was willing to forgive\r\nhim, but his master procured his conviction and execution by hanging.\r\nThe slave had but one arm; and an order on the state treasury by the\r\ncourt that tried him, which also assessed his value, brought him more\r\nmoney than he could have obtained for the slave in market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. ----, an elder of the Presbyterian Church in one of the slave\r\nstates, lately wrote a letter to an agent of the Anti-Slavery Society,\r\nin which he states the following fact. The name of the writer is with\r\nthe Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society.\r\n\r\n\"I was passing through a piece of timbered land, and on a sudden I\r\nheard a sound as of murder; I rode in that direction, and at some\r\ndistance discovered a naked black man, hung to the limb of a tree by\r\nhis hands, his feet chained together, and a pine rail laid with one\r\nend on the chain between his legs, and the other upon the ground, to\r\nsteady him; and in this condition the overseer gave him _four hundred\r\nlashes_. The miserably lacerated slave was then taken down, and put to\r\nthe care of a physician. And what do you suppose was the offence for\r\nwhich all this was done? Simply this; his owner, observing that he\r\nlaid off corn rows too crooked, he replied, 'Massa, much corn grow on\r\ncrooked row as on straight one!' This was it--this was enough. His\r\noverseer, boasting of his skill in managing a _nigger_, he was\r\nsubmitted to him, and treated as above.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID L. CHILD, Esq., of Northampton, Massachusetts, Secretary of the\r\nUnited States' minister at the Court of Lisbon during the\r\nadministration of President Monroe, stated the following fact in an\r\noration delivered by him in Boston, in 1831. (See Child's \"Despotism\r\nof Freedom,\" p. 30.\r\n\r\n\"An honorable friend, who stands high in the state and in the nation,\r\n[12] was _present at the_ burial of a female slave in Mississippi, who\r\n_had been whipped to death_ at the stake by her master, because she\r\nwas gone longer of an errand to the neighboring town than her master\r\nthought necessary. Under the lash she protested tlat she was ill, and\r\nwas obliged to rest in the fields. To complete the climax of horror,\r\nshe was delivered of a dead infant while undergoing the punishment.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"The narrator of this fact is now absent from the United\r\nStates, and I do not feel at liberty to mention his name.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same fact is stated by MRS. CHILD in her \"Appeal.\" In answer to a\r\nrecent letter, inquiring of Mr. and Mrs. Child if they were now at\r\nliberty to disclose the name of their informant, Mr. C. says,--\r\n\r\n\"The witness who stated to us the fact was John James Appleton, Esq.,\r\nof Cambridge, Mass. He is now in Europe, and it is not without some\r\nhesitation that I give his name. He, however, has openly embraced our\r\ncause, and taken a conspicuous part in some anti-slavery public\r\nmeetings since the time that I felt a scruple at publishing his name.\r\nMr. Appleton is a gentleman of high talents and accomplishments. He\r\nhas been Secretary of Legation at Rio Janeiro, Madrid, and the Hague;\r\nCommissioner at Naples, and Charge d'Affaires at Stockholm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two following facts are stated upon the authority of the REV.\r\nJOSEPH G. WILSON, pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Salem,\r\nWashington co., Indiana.\r\n\r\n\"In Bath co., Kentucky, Mr. L., in the year '32 or '33, while\r\nintoxicated, in a fit of rage whipped a female slave until she fainted\r\nand fell on the floor. Then he whipped her to get up; then with red\r\nhot tongs he burned off her ears, and whipped her again! but all in\r\nvain. He then ordered his negro men to carry her to the cabin. There\r\nshe was found dead next morning.\r\n\r\n\"One Wall, in Chester district, S.C., owned a slave, whom he hired to\r\nhis brother-in-law, Wm. Beckman, for whom the slave worked eighteen\r\nmonths, and worked well. Two weeks after returning to his master he\r\nran away on account of bad treatment. To induce him to return, the\r\nmaster sold him _nominally_ to his neighbor, to whom the slave gave\r\nhimself up, and by whom he was returned to his master:--Punishment,\r\n_stripes_. To prevent escape a bar of iron was fastened with three\r\nbands, at the waist, knee, and ankle. That night he broke the bands\r\nand bar, and escaped. Next day he was taken and whipped to death, by\r\nthree men, the master, Thorn, and the overseer. First, he was whipped\r\nand driven towards home; on the way he attempted to escape, and was\r\nshot at by the master,--caught, and knocked down with the butt of the\r\ngun by Thorn. In attempting to cross a ditch he fell, with his feet\r\ndown, and face on the bank; they whipped in vain to get him up--he\r\ndied. His soul ascended to God, to be a swift witness against his\r\noppressors. This took place at 12 o'clock. Next evening an inquest was\r\nheld. Of thirteen jurors, summoned by the coroner, nine said it was\r\nmurder; two said it was manslaughter, and two said it was JUSTIFIABLE!\r\nHe was bound over to court, tried, and acquitted--not even fined!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following fact is stated on the authority of Mr. WM. WILLIS,  of\r\nGreen Plains, Clark co. Ohio; formerly of Caroline co. on the eastern\r\nshore of Maryland.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. W. knew a slave called Peter White, who was sold to be taken to\r\nGeorgia; he escaped, and lived a long time in the woods--was finally\r\ntaken. When he found himself surrounded, he surrendered himself\r\nquietly. When his pursuers had him in their possession, they shot him\r\nin the leg, and broke it, out of mere wantonness. The next day a\r\nMethodist minister set his leg, and bound it up with splints. The man\r\nwho took him, then went into his place of confinement, wantonly jumped\r\nupon his leg and crushed it. His name was William Sparks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our readers are familiar with the horrible atrocities\r\nperpetrated in New Orleans, in 1834, by a certain Madame La Laurie,\r\nupon her slaves. They were published extensively in northern\r\nnewspapers at the time. The following are extracts from the accounts\r\nas published in the New Orleans papers immediately after the\r\noccurrence. The New Orleans Bee says:--\r\n\r\n\"Upon entering one of the apartments, the most appalling spectacle met\r\ntheir eyes. Seven slaves, more or less horribly mutilated, were seen\r\nsuspended by the neck, with their limbs apparently stretched and torn,\r\nfrom one extremity to the other. They had been confined for several\r\nmonths in the situation from which they had thus providentially been\r\nrescued; and had been merely kept in existence to prolong their\r\nsufferings, and to make them taste all that a most refined cruelty\r\ncould inflict.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Mercantile Advertiser says:\r\n\r\n\"A negro woman was found chained, covered with bruises and wounds from\r\nsevere flogging.--All the apartments were then forced open. In a room\r\non the ground floor, two more were found chained, and in a deplorable\r\ncondition. Up stairs and in the garret, four more were found chained;\r\nsome so weak as to be unable to walk, and all covered with wounds and\r\nsores. One mulatto boy declares himself to have been chained for five\r\nmonths, being fed daily with only a handful of meal, and receiving\r\nevery morning the most cruel treatment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Courier says:--\r\n\r\n\"We saw one of these miserable beings.--He had a large hole in his\r\nhead--his body, from head to foot, was covered with scars and filled\r\nwith worms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Mercantile Advertiser says:\r\n\r\n\"Seven poor unfortunate slaves were found--some chained to the floor,\r\nothers with chains around their necks, fastened to the ceiling; and\r\none poor old man, upwards of sixty years of age, chained hand and\r\nfoot, and made fast to the floor, in a _kneeling position_. His head\r\nbore the appearance of having been beaten until it was broken, and the\r\nworms were actually to be seen making a feast of his brains!! A woman\r\nhad her back literally cooked (if the expression may be used) with the\r\nlash; _the very bones might be seen projecting through the skin!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York Sun, of Feb. 21, 1837, contains the following:--\r\n\r\n\"Two negroes, runaways from Virginia, were overtaken a few days since\r\nnear Johnstown, Cambria co. Pa. when the persons in pursuit called out\r\nfor them to stop or they would shoot them.--One of the negroes turned\r\naround and said, he would die before he would be taken, and at the\r\nmoment received a rifle ball through his knee: the other started to\r\nrun, but was brought to the ground by a ball being shot in his back.\r\nAfter receiving the above wounds they made battle with their pursuers,\r\nbut were captured and brought into Johnstown. It is said that the\r\nyoung men who shot them had orders to take them dead or alive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. M.M. SHAFTER, of Townsend, Vermont, recently a graduate of the\r\nWesleyan University at Middletown, Connecticut, makes the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"Some of the events of the Southampton, Va. insurrection were narrated\r\nto me by Mr. Benjamin W. Britt, from Riddicksville, N.C. Mr. Britt\r\nclaimed the honor of having shot a black on that occasion, for the\r\ncrime of disobeying Mr. Britt's imperative 'Stop.' And Mr. Ashurst, of\r\nEdenton, Georgia, told me that a neighbor of his 'fired at a likely\r\nnegro boy of his mother,' because the said boy encroached upon his\r\npremises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. DAVID HAWLEY, a class leader in the Methodist Episcopal Church at\r\nSt. Albans, Licking county, Ohio, who moved from Kentucky to Ohio in\r\n1831, certifies as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"About the year 1825, a slave had escaped for Canada, but was arrested\r\nin Hardin county. On his return, I saw him in Hart county--his wrists\r\ntied together before, his arms tied close to his body, the rope then\r\npassing behind his body, thence to the neck of a horse on which rode\r\nthe master, with a club about three feet long, and of the size of a\r\nhoe handle; which, by the appearance of the slave, had been used on\r\nhis head, so as to wear off the hair and skin in several places, and\r\nthe blood was running freely from his mouth and nose; his heels very\r\nmuch bruised by the horse's feet, as his master had rode on him\r\nbecause he _would_ not go fast enough. Such was the slave's appearance\r\nwhen passing through where I resided. Such cases were not unfrequent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is furnished by Mr. F.A. HART, of Middletown,\r\nConnecticut, a manufacturer, and an influential member of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church. It occurred in 1824, about twenty-five\r\nmiles this side of Baltimore, Maryland.--\r\n\r\n\"I had spent the night with a Methodist brother; and while at\r\nbreakfast, a person came in and called for help. We went out and found\r\na crowd collected around a carriage. Upon approaching we discovered\r\nthat a slave-trader was endeavoring to force a woman into his\r\ncarriage. He had already put in three children, the youngest\r\napparently about eight years of age. The woman was strong, and\r\nwhenever he brought her to the side of the carriage, she resisted so\r\neffectually with her feet that he could not get her in. The woman\r\nbecoming exhausted, at length, by her frantic efforts, he thrust her\r\nin with great violence, _stamped her down upon the bottom with his\r\nfeet_! shouted to the driver to go on; and away they rolled, the\r\nmiserable captives moaning and shrieking, until their voices were lost\r\nin the distance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SAMUEL HALL, a teacher in Marietta College, Ohio, writes as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. ISAAC C. FULLER is a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church in\r\nMarietta. He was a fellow student of mine while in college, and now\r\nresides in this place. He says:--In 1832, as I was descending the Ohio\r\nwith a flat boat, near the 'French Islands,' so called, below\r\nCincinnati, I saw two negroes on horseback. The horses apparently took\r\nfright at something and ran. Both jumped over a rail fence; and one of\r\nthe horses, in so doing, broke one of his fore-legs, falling at the\r\nsame time and throwing the negro who was upon his back. A white man\r\ncame out of a house not over two hundred yards distant, and came to\r\nthe spot. Seizing a stake from the fence, he knocked the negro down\r\nfive or six times in succession.\r\n\r\n\"In the same year I worked for a Mr. Nowland, eleven miles above Baton\r\nRouge, La. at a place called 'Thomas' Bend.' He had an overseer who\r\nwas accustomed to flog more or less of the slaves every morning. I\r\nheard the blows and screams as regularly as we used to hear the\r\ncollege bell that summoned us to any duty when we went to school. This\r\noverseer was a nephew of Nowland, and there were about fifty slaves on\r\nhis plantation. Nowland himself related the following to me. One of\r\nhis slaves ran away, and came to the Homo Chitto river, where he found\r\nno means of crossing. Here he fell in with a white man who knew his\r\nmaster, being on a journey from that vicinity. He induced the slave to\r\nreturn to Baton Rouge, under the promise of giving him a pass, by\r\nwhich he might escape, but, in reality, to betray him to his master.\r\nThis he did, instead of fulfilling his promise. Nowland said that he\r\ntook the slave and inflicted five hundred lashes upon him, cutting his\r\nback all to pieces, and then thew on hot embers. The slave was on the\r\nplantation at the time, and told me the same story. He also rolled up\r\nhis sleeves, and showed me the scars on his arms, which, in\r\nconsequence, appeared in places to be callous to the bone. I was with\r\nNowland between five and six months.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. JOHN RANKIN, formerly of Tennessee, now pastor of the\r\nPresbyterian Church of Ripley, Ohio, has furnished the following\r\nstatement:--\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. LUDWELL G. GAINES, now pastor of the Presbyterian Church of\r\nGoshen, Clermont county, Ohio, stated to me, that while a resident of\r\na slave state, he was summoned to assist in taking a man who had made\r\nhis black woman work naked several days, and afterwards murdered her.\r\nThe murderer armed himself, and threatened to shoot the officer who\r\nwent to take him; and although there was ample assistance at hand, the\r\nofficer declined further interference.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN adds the following:--\r\n\r\n\"A Presbyterian preacher, now resident in a slave state, and therefore\r\nit is not expedient to give his name, stated, that he saw on board of\r\na steamboat at Louisville, Kentucky, a woman who had been forced on\r\nboard, to be carried off from all she counted dear on earth. She ran\r\nacross the boat and threw herself into the river, in order to end a\r\nlife of intolerable sorrows. She was drawn back to the boat and taken\r\nup. The brutal driver beat her severely, and she immediately threw\r\nherself again into the river. She was hooked up again, chained, and\r\ncarried off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTestimony of M. WILLIAM HANSBOROUGH, of Culpepper county, Virginia,\r\nthe \"owner\" of sixty slaves.\r\n\r\n\"I saw a slave taken out of prison by his master, on a hot summer's\r\nday, and driven, by said master, on the road before him, till he\r\ndropped down dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above statement was made by Mr. Hansborough to Lindley Coates, of\r\nLancaster county, Pa. a distinguished member of the Society of\r\nFriends, and a member of the late Convention in Pa. for altering the\r\nState Constitution. The letter from Mr. C. containing this testimony\r\nof Mr. H. is now before us.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. TOBIAS BOUDINOT, a member of the Methodist Church in St. Albans,\r\nLicking county, Ohio, says:\r\n\r\n\"In Nicholasville, Ky. in the year 1823, he saw a slave fleeing before\r\nthe patrol, but he was overtaken near where he stood, and a man with a\r\nknotted cane, as large as his wrist, struck the slave a number of\r\ntimes on his head, until the club was broken and he made tame; the\r\nblood was thrown in every direction by the violence of the blows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. WILLIAM DICKEY, of Bloomingburg, Fayette county, Ohio, wrote\r\na letter to the Rev. John Rankin, of Ripley, Ohio thirteen years\r\nsince, containing a description of the cutting up of a slave with a\r\nbroad axe; beginning at the feet and gradually cutting the legs, arms,\r\nand body into pieces! This diabolical atrocity was committed in the\r\nstate of Kentucky, in the year 1807. The perpetrators of the deed were\r\ntwo brothers, Lilburn and Isham Lewis, NEPHEWS OF PRESIDENT JEFFERSON.\r\nThe writer of this having been informed by Mr. Dickey, that some of\r\nthe facts connected with this murder were not contained in his letter\r\npublished by Mr. Rankin, requested him to write the account _anew_,\r\nand furnish the additional facts. This he did, and the letter\r\ncontaining it was published in the \"Human Rights\" for August, 1837. We\r\ninsert it here, slightly abridged, with the introductory remarks which\r\nappeared in that paper.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dickey's first letter has been scattered all over the country,\r\nsouth and north; and though multitudes have affected to disbelieve its\r\nstatements, _Kentuckians_ know the truth of them quite too well to\r\ncall them in question. The story is fiction or fact--if _fiction_, why\r\nhas it not been nailed to the wall? Hundreds of people around the\r\nmouth of Cumberland River are personally knowing to these facts.\r\n_There_ are the records of the court that tried the wretches.--_There_\r\ntheir acquaintances and kindred still live. All over that region of\r\ncountry, the brutal butchery of George is a matter of public\r\nnotoriety. It is quite needless, perhaps, to add, that the Rev. Wm.\r\nDickey is a Presbyterian clergyman, one of the oldest members of the\r\nChilicothe Presbytery, and greatly respected and beloved by the\r\nchurches in Southern Ohio. He was born in South Carolina, and was for\r\nmany years pastor of a church in Kentucky.\"\r\n\r\nREV. WM. DICKEY'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\"In the county of Livingston, KY. near the mouth of Cumberland River,\r\nlived Lilburn Lewis, a sister's son of the celebrated Jefferson. He\r\nwas the wealthy owner of a considerable gang of negroes, whom he drove\r\nconstantly, fed sparingly, and lashed severely. The consequence was,\r\nthat they would run away. Among the rest was an ill-thrived boy of\r\nabout seventeen, who, having just returned from a skulking spell, was\r\nsent to the spring for water, and in returning let fall an elegant\r\npitcher: it was dashed to shivers upon the rocks. This was made the\r\noccasion for reckoning with him. It was night, and the slaves were all\r\nat home. The master had them all collected in the most roomy negro\r\nhouse, and a rousing fire put on. When the door was secured, that none\r\nmight escape, either through _fear of him_ or _sympathy with George_,\r\nhe opened to them the design of the interview, namely, that they might\r\nbe effectually advised to _stay at home and obey his orders_. All\r\nthings now in train, he called up George, who approached his master\r\nwith unreserved submission. He bound him with cords; and by the\r\nassistance of Isham Lewis, his youngest brother, laid him on a broad\r\nbench, the _meat-block_. He then proceeded to _hack off George at the\r\nankles_! It was with the _broad axe_! In vain did the unhappy victim\r\n_scream and roar_! for he was completely in his master's power; not a\r\nhand among so many durst interfere; casting the feet into the fire, he\r\nlectured them at some length.--He next _chopped him off below the\r\nknees_! George _roaring out_ and praying his master to begin at the\r\n_other end_! He admonished them again, throwing the legs into the\r\nfire--then, above the knees, tossing the joints into the fire--the\r\nnext stroke severed the thighs from the body; these were also\r\ncommitted to the flames--and so it may be said of the arms, head, and\r\ntrunk, until all was in the fire! He threatened any of them with\r\nsimilar punishment who should in future disobey, run away, or disclose\r\nthe proceedings of that evening. Nothing now remained but to consume\r\nthe flesh and bones; and for this purpose the fire was brightly\r\nstirred until two hours after midnight; when a coarse and heavy\r\nback-wall, composed of rock and clay, covered the fire and the remains\r\nof George. It was the Sabbath--this put an end to the _amusements_ of\r\nthe evening. The negroes were now permitted to disperse, with charges\r\nto keep this matter among themselves, and never to whisper it in the\r\nneighbourhood, under the penalty of a like punishment.\r\n\r\n\"When he returned home and retired, his wife exclaimed, 'Why, Mr.\r\nLewis, where have you been, and what were you doing?' She had heard a\r\nstrange _pounding_ and dreadful _screams_, and had smelled something\r\nlike fresh meat _burning_. The answer he returned was, that he had\r\nnever enjoyed himself at a ball so well as he had enjoyed himself that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"Next morning he ordered the hands to rebuild the back-wall, and he\r\nhimself superintended the work, throwing the pieces of flesh that\r\nstill remained, with the bones, behind, as it went up--thus hoping to\r\nconceal the matter. But it _could not be hid_--much as the negroes\r\nseemed to hazard, they did _whisper the horrid deed_. The neighbors\r\ncame, and in his presence tore down the wall; and finding the\r\n_remains_ of the boy, they apprehended Lewis and his brother, and\r\ntestified against them. They were committed to jail, that they might\r\nanswer at the coming court for this shocking outrage; but finding\r\nsecurity for their appearance at court, THEY WERE ADMITTED TO BAIL!\r\n\r\n\"In the interim, other articles of evidence leaked out. That of Mrs.\r\nLewis hearing a pounding, and screaming and her smelling fresh meat\r\nburning, for not till now had this come out. He was offended with her\r\nfor disclosing these things, alleging that they might have some weight\r\nagainst him at the pending trial.\r\n\r\n\"In connection with this is another item, full of horror. Mr.s. Lewis,\r\nor her girl, in making her bed one morning after this, found, under\r\nher bolster, a keen BUTCHER KNIFE! The appalling discovery forced from\r\nher the confession that she considered her life in jeopardy. Messrs.\r\nRice and Philips, whose wives were her sisters, went to see her and to\r\nbring her away if she wished it. Mr. Lewis received them with all the\r\nexpressions of _Virginia hospitality_. As soon as they were seated\r\nthey said, 'Well, Letitia, we supposed that you might be unhappy here,\r\nand afraid for your life; and we have come to-day to take you to your\r\nfather's, if you desire it.' She said, 'Thank you, kind brothers, I am\r\nindeed afraid for my life.'--We need not interrupt the story to tell\r\nhow much surprised he affected to be with this strange procedure of\r\nhis brothers-in-law, and with this declaration of his wife. But all\r\nhis professions of fondness for her, to the contrary notwithstanding,\r\nthey rode off with her before his eyes.--He followed and overtook, and\r\nwent with them to her father's; but she was locked up from him, with\r\nher own consent, and he returned home.\r\n\r\n\"Now he saw that his character was gone, his respectable friends\r\nbelieved that he had massacred George; but, worst of all, he saw that\r\nthey considered the life of the harmless Letitia was in danger from\r\nhis perfidious hands. It was too much for his chivalry to sustain. The\r\nproud Virginian sunk under the accumulated load of public odium. He\r\nproposed to his brother Isham, who had been his accomplice in the\r\nGeorge affair, that they should finish the play of life with a still\r\ndeeper tragedy. The plan was, that they should shoot one another.\r\nHaving made the hot-brained bargain, they repaired with their guns to\r\nthe grave-yard, which was on an eminence in the midst of his\r\nplantation. It was inclosed with a railing, say thirty feet square.\r\nOne was to stand at one railing, and the other over against him at the\r\nother. They were to make ready, take aim, and count deliberately 1, 2,\r\n3, and then fire. Lilburn's will was written, and thrown down open\r\nbeside him. They cocked their guns and raised them to their faces; but\r\nthe peradventure occurring that one of the guns might miss fire, Isham\r\nwas sent for a rod, and when it was brought, Lilburn cut it off at\r\nabout the length of two feet, and was showing his brother how the\r\nsurvivor might do, provided one of the guns should fail; (for they\r\nwere determined upon going together;) but forgetting, perhaps, in the\r\nperturbation of the moment that the gun was cocked, when he touched\r\ntrigger with the rod the gun fired, and he fell, and died in a few\r\nminutes--and was with George in the eternal world, where _the slave is\r\nfree from his master_. But poor Isham was so terrified with this\r\nunexpected occurrence and so confounded by the awful contortions of\r\nhis brother's face, that he had not nerve enough to follow up the\r\nplay, and finish the plan as was intended, but suffered Lilburn to go\r\nalone. The negroes came running to see what it meant that a gun should\r\nbe fired in the grave-yard. There lay their master, dead! They ran for\r\nthe neighbors. Isham still remained on the spot. The neighbors at the\r\nfirst charged him with the murder of his brother. But he, though as if\r\nhe had lost more than half his mind, told the whole story; and the\r\ncourse of range of the ball in the dead man's body agreeing with his\r\nstatement, Isham was not farther charged with Lilburn's death.\r\n\r\n\"The Court sat--Isham was judged to be guilty of a capital crime in\r\nthe affair of George. He was to be hanged at Salem. The day was set.\r\nMy good old father visited him in the prison--two or three times\r\ntalked and prayed with him; I visited him once myself. We fondly hoped\r\nthat he was a sincere penitent. Before the day of execution came, by\r\nsome means, I never knew what, Isham was _missing_. About two years\r\nafter, we learned that he had gone down to Natchez, and had married a\r\nlady of some refinement and piety. I saw her letters to his sisters,\r\nwho were worthy members of the church of which I was pastor. The last\r\nletter told of his death. He was in Jackson's army, and fell in the\r\nfamous battle of New Orleans.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, sir, your friend,\r\n\r\n\"WM. DICKEY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL NARRATIVES-PART III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE AND TESTIMONY OF REV. FRANCIS HAWLEY.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley is the pastor of the Baptist Church in Colebrook,\r\nLitchfield county, Connecticut. He has resided fourteen years in the\r\nslave states, North and South Carolina. His character and standing\r\nwith his own denomination at the south, may be inferred from the\r\nfact, that the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina appointed\r\nhim, a few years since, their general agent to visit the Baptist\r\nchurches within their bounds, and to secure their co-operation in\r\nthe objects of the Convention. Mr. H. accepted the appointment, and\r\nfor some time traveled in that capacity.\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice that the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety have resolved to publish a volume of facts and testimony\r\nrelative to the character and workings of American slavery. Having\r\nresided fourteen years at the south, I cheerfully comply with your\r\nrequest, to give the result of my observation and experience.\r\n\r\n\"And I would here remark, that one may reside at the south for years,\r\nand not witness extreme cruelties; a northern man, and one who is not\r\na slaveholder, would be the last to have an opportunity of witnessing\r\nthe infliction of cruel punishments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\"A majority of the large plantations are on the banks of rivers, far\r\nfrom the public eye. A great deal of low marshy ground lies in the\r\nvicinity of most of the rivers at the south; consequently the main\r\nroads are several miles from the rivers, and generally no _public_\r\nroad passes the plantations. A stranger traveling on the _ridge_,\r\nwould think himself in a miserably poor country; but every two or\r\nthree miles he will see a road turning off and leading into the swamp;\r\ntaking one of those roads, and traveling from two to six miles, he\r\nwill come to a large gate; passing which, he will find himself in a\r\nclearing of several hundred acres of the first quality of land;\r\npassing on, he will see 30, or 40, or more slaves--men, women, boys\r\nand girls, at their task, every one with a hoe; or, if in cotton\r\npicking season, with their baskets. The overseer, with his whip,\r\neither riding or standing about among them; or if the weather is hot,\r\nsitting under a shade. At a distance, on a little rising ground, if\r\nsuch there be, he will see a cluster of huts, with a tolerable house\r\nin the midst, for the overseer. Those huts are from ten to fifteen\r\nfeet square, built of logs, and covered, not with shingles, but with\r\nboards, about four feet long, split out of pine timber with a\r\n'_frow_'. The floors are very commonly made in this way. Clay is first\r\nworked until it is soft; it is then spread upon the ground, about four\r\nor five inches thick; when it dries, it becomes nearly as hard as a\r\nbrick. The crevices between the logs are sometimes filled with the\r\nsame. These huts generally cost the master nothing--they are commonly\r\nbuilt by the negroes at night, and on Sundays. When a slave of a\r\nneighboring plantation takes a wife, or to use the phrase common at\r\nthe south, 'takes up' with one of the women, he builds a hut, and it\r\nis called her house. Upon entering these huts, (not as comfortable in\r\nmany instances as the horse stable,) generally, you will find no\r\nchairs, but benches and stools; no table, no bedstead, and no bed,\r\nexcept a blanket or two, and a few rags or moss; in some instances a\r\nknife or two, but very rarely a fork. You may also find a pot or\r\nskillet, and generally a number of gourds, which serve them instead of\r\nbowls and plates. The cruelties practiced on those secluded\r\nplantations, the judgment day alone can reveal. Oh, Brother, could I\r\nsummon ten slaves from ten plantations that I could name, and have\r\nthem give but one year's history of their bondage, it would thrill the\r\nland with horror. Those overseers who follow the business of\r\noverseeing for a livelihood, are generally the most unprincipled and\r\nabandoned of men. Their wages are regulated according to their skill\r\nin extorting labor. The one who can make the most bags of cotton, with\r\na given number of hands, is the one generally sought after; and there\r\nis a competition among them to see who shall make the largest crop,\r\naccording to the hands he works. I ask, what must be the condition of\r\nthe poor slaves, under the unlimited power of such men, in whom, by\r\nthe long-continued practise of the most heart-rending cruelties, every\r\nfeeling of humanity has been obliterated? But it may be asked, cannot\r\nthe slaves have redress by appealing to their masters? In many\r\ninstances it is impossible, as their masters live hundreds of miles\r\noff. There are perhaps thousands in the northern slave states, [and\r\nmany in the free states,] who own plantations in the southern slave\r\nstates, and many more spend their summers at the north, or at the\r\nvarious watering places. But what would the slaves gain, if they\r\nshould appeal to the master? He has placed the overseer over them,\r\nwith the understanding that he will make as large a crop as possible,\r\nand that he is to have entire control, and manage them according to\r\nhis own judgment. Now suppose that in the midst of the season, the\r\nslaves make complaint of cruel treatment. The master cannot get along\r\nwithout an overseer--it is perhaps very sickly on the plantation he\r\ndare not risk his own life there. Overseers are all enraged at that\r\nseason, and if he takes part with his slave against the overseer, he\r\nwould destroy his authority, and very likely provoke him to leave his\r\nservice--which would of course be a very great injury to him. Thus, in\r\nnineteen cases out of twenty, self-interest would prevent the master\r\nfrom paying any attention to the complaints of his slaves. And, if any\r\nshould complain, it would of course come to the ears of the overseer,\r\nand the complainant would be inhumanly punished for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTHING.\r\n\r\n\"The rule, where slaves are hired out, is two suits of clothes per\r\nyear, one pair of shoes, and one blanket; but as it relates to the\r\ngreat body of the slaves, this cannot be called a general rule. On\r\nmany plantations, the children under ten or twelve years old, go\r\n_entirely naked_--or, it clothed at all, they have nothing more than a\r\nshirt. The cloth is of the coarsest kind, far from being durable or\r\nwarm; and their shoes frequently come to pieces in a few weeks. I\r\nhave never known any provision made, or time allowed for the washing\r\nof clothes. If they wish to wash, as they have generally but one suit,\r\nthey go after their day's toil to some stream, build a fire, pull off\r\ntheir clothes and wash them in the stream, and dry them by the fire;\r\nand in some instances they wear their clothes until they are worn off;\r\nwithout washing. I have never known an instance of a slaveholder\r\nputting himself to any expense, that his slaves might have decent\r\nclothes for the Sabbath. If by making baskets, brooms, mats, &c. at\r\nnight or on Sundays, the slaves can get money enough to buy a Sunday\r\nsuit, very well. I have never known an instance of a slaveholder\r\nfurnishing his slaves with stockings or mittens. I _know_ that the\r\nslaves suffer much, and no doubt many die in consequence of not being\r\nwell clothed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD.\r\n\r\n\"In the grain-growing part of the south, the slaves, as it relates to\r\nfood, fare tolerably well; but in the cotton, and rice-growing, and\r\nsugar-making portion, some of them fare badly. I have been on\r\nplantations where, from the appearance of the slaves, I should judge\r\nthey were half-starved. They receive their allowance very commonly on\r\nSunday morning. They are left to cook it as they please, and when they\r\nplease. Many slaveholders rarely give their slaves meat, and very few\r\ngive them more food than will keep them in a working condition. They\r\nrarely ever have a _change_ of food. I have never known an instance of\r\nslaves on plantations being furnished either with sugar, butter,\r\ncheese, or milk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK.\r\n\r\n\"If the slaves on plantations were well fed and clothed, and had the\r\nstimulus of wages, they could perhaps in general perform their tasks\r\nwithout injury. The horn is blown soon after the dawn of day, when all\r\nthe hands destined for the field must be 'on the march!' If the field\r\nis far from their huts, they take their breakfast with them. They toil\r\ntill about ten o'clock, when they eat it. They then continue their\r\ntoil till the sun is set.\r\n\r\n\"A neighbor of mine, who has been an overseer in Alabama, informs me,\r\nthat there they ascertain how much labor a slave can perform in a day,\r\nin the following manner. When they commence a new cotton field, the\r\noverseer takes his watch, and marks how long it takes them to hoe one\r\nrow, and then lays out the task accordingly. My neighbor also informs\r\nme, that the slaves in Alabama are worked very hard; that the lash is\r\nalmost universally applied at the close of the day, if they fail to\r\nperform their task in the cotton-picking season. You will see them,\r\nwith their baskets of cotton, slowly bending their way to the cotton\r\nhouse, where each one's basket is weighed. They have no means of\r\nknowing accurately, in the course of the day, how they make progress;\r\nso that they are in suspense, until their basket is weighed. Here\r\ncomes the mother, with her children; she does not know whether\r\nherself, or children, or all of them, must take the lash; they cannot\r\nweigh the cotton themselves--the whole must be trusted to the\r\noverseer. While the weighing goes on, all is still. So many pounds\r\nshort, cries the overseer, and takes up his whip, exclaiming, 'Step\r\nthis way, you d--n lazy scoundrel, or bitch.' The poor slave begs, and\r\npromises, but to no purpose. The lash is applied until the overseer is\r\nsatisfied. Sometimes the whipping is deferred until the weighing is\r\nall over. I have said that all must be _trusted_ to the overseer. If\r\nhe owes any one a grudge, or wishes to enjoy the fiendish pleasure of\r\nwhipping a little, (for some overseers really delight in it,) they\r\nhave only to tell a falsehood relative to the weight of their basket;\r\nthey can then have a pretext to gratify their diabolical disposition;\r\nand from the character of overseers, I have no doubt that it is\r\nfrequently done. On all plantations, the male and female slaves fare\r\npretty much alike; those who are with child are driven to their task\r\ntill within a few days of the time of their delivery; and when the\r\nchild is a few weeks old, the mother must again go to the field. If it\r\nis far from her hut, she must take her babe with her, and leave it in\r\nthe care of some of the children--perhaps of one not more than four or\r\nfive years old. If the child cries, she cannot go to its relief; the\r\neye of the overseer is upon her; and if, when she goes to nurse it,\r\nshe stays a little longer than the overseer thinks necessary, he\r\ncommands her back to her task, and perhaps a husband and father must\r\nhear and witness it all. Brother, you cannot begin to know what the\r\npoor slave mothers suffer, on thousands of plantations at the south.\r\n\r\n\"I will now give a few facts, showing the workings of the system. Some\r\nyears since, a Presbyterian minister moved from North Carolina to\r\nGeorgia. He had a negro man of an uncommon mind. For some cause, I\r\nknow not what, this minister whipped him most unmercifully. He next\r\nnearly _drowned_ him; he then put him _in the fence_; this is done by\r\nlifting up the corner of a 'worm' fence, and then putting the feet\r\nthrough; the rails serve as _stocks_. He kept him there some time, how\r\nlong I was not informed, but the poor slave _died_ in a few days; and,\r\nif I was rightly informed, nothing was done about it, either in church\r\nor state. After some tame, he moved back to North Carolina, and is now\r\na member of ---- Presbytery. I have heard him preach, and have been in\r\nthe pulpit with him. May God forgive me!\r\n\r\n\"At Laurel Hill, Richmond county, North Carolina, it was reported that\r\na runaway slave was in the neighborhood. A number of young men took\r\ntheir guns, and went in pursuit. Some of them took their station near\r\nthe stage road, and kept on the look-out. It was early in the\r\nevening--the poor slave came along, when the ambush rushed upon him,\r\nand ordered him to surrender. He refused, and kept them off with his\r\nclub. They still pressed upon him with their guns presented to his\r\nbreast. Without seeming to be daunted, he caught hold of the muzzle of\r\none of the guns, and came near getting possession of it. At length,\r\nretreating to a fence on one side of the road, he sprang over into a\r\ncorn-field, and started to run in one of the rows. One of the young\r\nmen stepped to the fence, fired, and lodged the whole charge between\r\nhis shoulders; he fell, and died in a short time. He died without\r\ntelling who his master was, or whether he had any, or what his own\r\nname was, or where he was from. A hole was dug by the side of the road\r\nhis body tumbled into it, and thus ended the whole matter.\r\n\r\n\"The Rev, Mr. C. a Methodist minister, held as his slave a negro man,\r\nwho was a member of his own church. The slave was considered a very\r\npious man, had the confidence of his master, and all who knew him, and\r\nif I recollect right, he sometimes attempted to preach. Just before\r\nthe Nat Turner insurrection, in Southampton county, Virginia, by which\r\nthe whole south was thrown into a panic, then worthy slave obtained\r\npermission to visit his relatives, who resided either in Southampton,\r\nor the county adjoining. This was the only instance that ever came to\r\nmy knowledge, of a slave being permitted to go so far to visit his\r\nrelatives. He went and returned according to agreement. A few weeks\r\nafter his return, the insurrection took place, and the whole country\r\nwas deeply agitated. Suspicion soon fixed on this slave. Nat Turner\r\nwas a Baptist minister, and the south became exceedingly jealous of\r\nall negro preachers. It seemed as if the whole community were\r\nimpressed with the belief that he knew all about it; that he and Nat\r\nTurner had concocted an extensive insurrection; and so confident were\r\nthey in this belief, that they took the poor slave, tried him, and\r\nhung him. It was all done in a few days. He protested his innocence to\r\nthe last. After the excitement was over, many were ready to\r\nacknowledge that they believed him innocent. He was hung upon\r\n_suspicion_!\r\n\r\n\"In R---- county, North Carolina, lived a Mr. B. who had the name of\r\nbeing a cruel master. Three or four winters since, his slaves were\r\nengaged in clearing a piece of new land. He had a negro girl, about 14\r\nyears old, whom he had severely whipped a few days before, for not\r\nperforming her task. She again failed. The hands left the field for\r\nhome; she went with them a part of the way, and fell behind; but the\r\nnegroes thought she would soon be along; the evening passed away, and\r\nshe did not come. They finally concluded that she had gone back to the\r\nnew ground, to lie by the log heaps that were on fire. But they were\r\nmistaken: she had sat down by the foot of a large pine. She was thinly\r\nclad--the night was cold and rainy. In the morning the poor girl was\r\nfound, but she was speechless and died in a short time.\r\n\r\n\"One of my neighbors sold to a speculator a negro boy, about 14 years\r\nold. It was more than his poor mother could bear. Her reason fled, and\r\nshe became a perfect _maniac_, and had to be kept in close\r\nconfinement. She would occasionally get out and run off to the\r\nneighbors. On one of these occasions she came to my house. She was\r\nindeed a pitiable object. With tears rolling down her checks, and her\r\nframe shaking with agony, she would cry out, _'don't you hear\r\nhim--they are whipping him now, and he is calling for me!'_ This\r\nneighbor of mine, who tore the boy away from his poor mother, and thus\r\nbroke her heart, was a _member of the Presbyterian church._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. S----, of Marion District, South Carolina, informed me that a boy\r\nwas killed by the overseer on Mr. P----'s plantation. The boy was\r\nengaged in driving the horses in a cotton gin. The driver generally\r\nsits on the end of the sweep. Not driving to suit the overseer, he\r\nknocked him off with the butt of his whip. His skull was fractured. He\r\ndied in a short time.\r\n\r\n\"A man of my acquaintance in South Carolina, and of considerable\r\nwealth, had an only son, whom he educated for the bar; but not\r\nsucceeding in his profession, he soon returned home. His father having\r\na small plantation three or four miles off; placed his son on it as an\r\noverseer. Following the example of his father, as I have good reason\r\nto believe, he took the wife of one of the negro men. The poor slave\r\nfelt himself greatly injured, and expostulated with him. The wretch\r\ntook his gun, and deliberately shot him. Providentially he only\r\nwounded him badly. When the father came, and undertook to remonstrate\r\nwith his son about his conduct, he threatened to shoot him also! and\r\nfinally, took the negro woman, and went to Alabama, where he still\r\nresided when I left the south.\r\n\r\n\"An elder in the Presbyterian church related to me the following.--'A\r\nspeculator with his drove of negroes was passing my house, and I\r\nbought a little girl, nine or ten years old. After a few months, I\r\nconcluded that I would rather have a plough-boy. Another speculator\r\nwas passing, and I sold the girl. She was much distressed, and was\r\nvery unwilling to leave.'--She had been with him long enough to become\r\nattached to his own and his negro children, and he concluded by\r\nsaying, that in view of the little girl's tears and cries, he had\r\ndetermined never to do the like again. I would not trust him, for I\r\nknow him to be a very avaricious man.\r\n\r\n\"While traveling in Anson county, North Carolina, I put up for a night\r\nat a private house. The man of the house was not at home when I\r\nstopped, but came in the course of the evening, and was noisy and\r\nprofane, and nearly drunk. I retired to rest, but not to sleep; his\r\ncursing and swearing were enough to keep a regiment awake. About\r\nmidnight he went to his kitchen, and called out his two slaves, a man\r\nand woman. His object, he said, was to whip them. They both begged and\r\npromised, but to no purpose. The whipping began, and continued for\r\nsome time. Their cries might have been heard at a distance.\r\n\r\n\"I was acquainted with a very wealthy planter, on the Pedee river, in\r\nSouth Carolina, who has since died in consequence of intemperance. It\r\nwas said that he had occasioned the death of twelve of his slaves, by\r\ncompelling them to work in water, opening a ditch in the midst of\r\nwinter. The disease with which they died was a pleurisy.\r\n\r\n\"In crossing Pedee river, at Cashway Ferry, I observed that the\r\nferryman had no hair on either side of his head, I asked him the\r\ncause. He informed me that it was caused by his master's cane. I said,\r\nyou have a very bad master. 'Yes, a very bad master.' I understood\r\nthat he was once a number of Congress from South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"While traveling as agent for the North Carolina Baptist State\r\nConvention, I attended a three days' meeting in Gates county, Friday,\r\nthe first day, passed off. Saturday morning came, and the pastor of\r\nthe church, who lived a few miles off, did not make his appearance.\r\nThe day passed off, and no news from the pastor. On Sabbath morning,\r\nhe came hobbling along, having but little use of one foot. He soon\r\nexplained: said he had a hired negro man, who, on Saturday morning,\r\ngave him a 'little _slack jaw.'_ Not having a stick at hand, he fell\r\nupon him with his fist and foot, and in _kicking_ him, he injured his\r\nfoot so seriously, that he could not attend meeting on Saturday.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the slaveholding ministers at the south, put their slaves\r\nunder overseers, or hire them out, and then take the pastoral care of\r\nchurches. The Rev. Mr. B----, formerly of Pennsylvania, had a\r\nplantation in Marlborough District, South Carolina, and was the pastor\r\nof a church in Darlington District. The Rev. Mr. T----, of Johnson\r\ncounty, North Carolina, has a plantation in Alabama.\r\n\r\n\"I was present, and saw the Rev. J---- W----, of Mecklenburg county,\r\nNorth Carolina, hire out four slaves to work in the gold mines is\r\nBurke county. The Rev. H---- M----, of Orange county, sold for $900, a\r\nnegro man to a speculator, on a Monday of a camp meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Runaway slaves are frequently hunted with guns and dogs. _I was once\r\nout on such an excursion, with my rifle and two dogs._ I trust the\r\nLord has forgiven me this heinous wickedness! We did not take the\r\nrunaways.\r\n\r\n\"Slaves are sometimes most unmercifully punished for trifling\r\noffences, or mere mistakes.\r\n\r\n\"As it relates to amalgamation, I can say, that I have been in\r\nrespectable families, (so called,) where I could distinguish the\r\nfamily resemblance in the slaves who waited upon the table. I once\r\nhired a slave who belonged to his own _uncle._ It is so common for the\r\nfemale slaves to have white children, that little or nothing is ever\r\nsaid about it. Very few inquiries are made as to who the father is.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, brother ----, I have given you very briefly, the result, in\r\npart, of my observations and experience relative to slavery. You can\r\nmake what disposition of it you please. I am willing that my name\r\nshould go to the world with what I have now written.\r\n\r\n\"Yours affectionately, for the oppressed,\r\n\r\n\"FRANCIS HAWLEY.\"\r\n\r\n_Colebrook, Connecticut, March_ 18, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF REUBEN G. MACY AND RICHARD MACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract of a letter recently received from CHARLES\r\nMARRIOTT of Hudson, New York. Mr. Marriott is an elder in the\r\nReligious Society of Friends, and is extensively known and respected.\r\n\r\n\"The two following brief statements, are furnished by Richard Macy and\r\nReuben G. Macy, brothers, both of Hudson, New York. They are head\r\ncarpenters by trade, and have been well known to me for more than\r\nthirty years, as esteemed members of the Religious Society of Friends.\r\nThey inform me that during their stay in South Carolina, a number more\r\nsimilar cases to those here related, came under their notice, which to\r\navoid repetition they omit.\r\n\r\nC. MARRIOTT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF REUBEN G. MACY.\r\n\r\n\"During the winter of 1818 and 19, I resided on an island near the\r\nmouth of the Savanna river, on the South Carolina side. Most of the\r\nslaves that came under my particular notice, belonged to a widow and\r\nher daughter, in whose family I lived. No white man belonged to the\r\nplantation. Her slaves were under the care of an overseer who came\r\nonce a week to give orders, and settled the score laid up against such\r\nas their mistress thought deserved punishment, which was from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty lashes on their naked backs, with a whip which\r\nthe overseer generally brought with him. This whip had a stout handle\r\nabout two feet long, and a lash about four and a half feet. From two\r\nto four received the above, I believe nearly every week during the\r\nwinter, sometimes in my presence, and always in my hearing. I examined\r\nthe backs and shoulders of a number of the men, which were mostly\r\nnaked while they were about their labor, and found them covered with\r\nhard ridges in every direction. One day, while busy in the cotton\r\nhouse, hearing a noise, I ran to the door and saw a colored woman\r\npleading with the overseer, who paid no attention to her cries, but\r\ntied her hands together, and passed the rope over a beam, over head,\r\nwhere was a platform for spreading cotton, he then drew the rope as\r\ntight as he could, so as to let her toes touch the ground; then\r\nstripped her body naked to the waist, and went deliberately to work\r\nwith his whip, and put on twenty-five or thirty lashes, she pleading\r\nin vain all the time. I inquired, the cause of such treatment, and was\r\ninformed it was for answering her mistress rather '_short_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman from a neighboring plantation came where I was, on a visit;\r\nshe came in a boat rowed by six slaves, who, according to the common\r\npractice, were left to take care of themselves, and having laid them\r\ndown in the boat and fallen asleep, the tide fell, and the water\r\nfilling the stern of the boat, wet their mistresses trunk of clothes.\r\nWhen she discovered it, she called them up near where I was, and\r\ncompelled them to whip each other, till they all had received a severe\r\nflogging. She standing by with a whip in her hand to see that they did\r\nnot spare each other. Their usual allowance of food was one peck of\r\ncorn per week, which was dealt out to them every first day of the\r\nweek, and such as were not there to receive their portion at the\r\nappointed time, had to live as they could during the coming week. Each\r\none had the privilege of planting a small piece of ground, and raising\r\npoultry for their own use which they generally sold, that is, such as\r\ndid improve the privilege which were but few. They had nothing allowed\r\nthem besides the corn, except one quarter of beef at Christmas which a\r\nslave brought three miles on his head. They were allowed three days\r\nrest at Christmas. Their clothing consisted of a pair of trowsers and\r\njacket, made of whitish woollen cloth called negro cloth. The women\r\nhad nothing but a petticoat, and a very short short-gown, made of the\r\nsame king of cloth. Some of the women had an old pair of shoes, but\r\nthey generally went _barefoot_. The houses for the field slaves were\r\nabout fourteen feet square, built in the coarsest manner, having but\r\none room, without any chimney, or flooring, with a hole at the roof at\r\none end to let the smoke out.\r\n\r\n\"Each one was allowed one blanket in which they rolled themselves up.\r\nI examined their houses but could not discover any thing like a bed. I\r\nwas informed that when they had a sufficiency of potatoes the slaves\r\nwere allowed some; but the season that I was there they did not raise\r\nmore than were wanted for seed. All their corn was ground in one\r\nhand-mill, every night just as much as was necessary for the family,\r\nthen each one his daily portion, which took considerable time in the\r\nnight. I often awoke and heard the sound of the mill. Grinding the\r\ncorn in the night, and in the dark, after their day's labor, and the\r\nwant of other food, were great hardships.\r\n\r\n\"The traveling in those parts, among the islands, was altogether with\r\nboats, rowed by from four to ten slaves, which often stopped at our\r\nplantation, and staid through the night, when the slaves, after rowing\r\nthrough the day, were left to shift for themselves; and when they went\r\nto Savannah with a load of cotton the were obliged to sleep in the\r\nopen boats, as the law did not allow a colored person to be out after\r\neight o'clock in the evening, without a pass from his master.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RICHARD MACY.\r\n\r\n\"The above account is from my brother, I was at work on Hilton Head\r\nabout twenty miles north of my brother, during the same winter. The\r\nsame allowance of one peck of corn for a week, the same kind of houses\r\nto live in, and the same method of grinding their corn, and always in\r\nthe night, and in the dark, was practiced there.\r\n\r\n\"A number of instances of severe whipping came under my notice. The\r\nfirst was this:--two men were sent out to saw some blocks out of large\r\nlive oak timber on which to raise my building. Their saw was in poor\r\norder, and they sawed them badly, for which their master stripped them\r\nnaked and flogged them.\r\n\r\n\"The next instance was a boy about sixteen years of age. He had crept\r\ninto the coach to sleep; after two or three nights he was caught by\r\nthe coach driver, a _northern man_, and stripped _entirely naked_, and\r\nwhipped without mercy, his master looking on.\r\n\r\n\"Another instance. The overseer, a young white man, had ordered\r\nseveral negroes a boat's crew, to be on the spot at a given time. One\r\nman did not appear until the boat had gone. The overseer was very\r\nangry and told him to strip and be flogged; he being slow, was told if\r\nhe did not instantly strip off his jacket, he, the overseer, would\r\nwhip it off which he did in shreds, whipping him cruelly.\r\n\r\n\"The man ran into the barrens and it was about a month before they\r\ncaught him. He was newly starved, and at last stole a turkey; then\r\nanother, and was caught.\r\n\r\n\"Having occasion to pass a plantation very early one foggy morning, in\r\na boat we heard the sound of the whip, before we could see, but as we\r\ndrew up in front of the plantation, we could see the negroes at work\r\nin the field. The overseer was going from one to the other causing\r\nthem to lay down their hoe, strip off their garment, hold up their\r\nhands and receive their number of lashes. Thus he went on from one to\r\nthe other until we were out of sight. In the course of the winter a\r\nfamily came where I was, on a visit from a neighboring island; of\r\ncourse, in a boat with negroes to row them--one of these a barber,\r\ntold me that he ran away about two years before, and joined a company\r\nof negroes who had fled to the swamps. He said they suffered a great\r\ndeal--were at last discovered by a party of hunters, who fired among\r\nthem, and caused them to scatter. Himself and one more fled to the\r\ncoast, took a boat and put off to sea, a storm came on and swamped or\r\nupset them, and his partner was drowned, he was taken up by a passing\r\nvessel and returned to his master.\r\n\r\nRICHARD MACY.\r\n\r\n_Hudson, 12 mo. 29th_, 1838.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MR. ELEAZAR POWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM MR. WILLIAM SCOTT, a highly respectable\r\ncitizen of Beaver co. Pennsylvania, dated Jan 7, 1839.\r\n\r\n_Chippeca Township, Beaver co. Pa. Jan._ 7, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"I send you the statement of Mr. Eleazar Powell, who was born, and has\r\nmostly resided in this township from his birth. His character for\r\nsobriety and truth stands above impeachment.\r\n\r\n\"With sentiments of esteem,\r\nI am your friend,\r\nWILLIAM SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of December, 1836, I went to the State of Mississippi to\r\nwork at my trade, (masonry and bricklaying,) and continued to work in\r\nthe counties of Adams and Jefferson, between four and five months. In\r\nfollowing my business I had an opportunity of seeing the treatment of\r\nslaves in several places.\r\n\r\n\"In Adams county I built a chimney for a man named Joseph Gwatney; he\r\nhad forty-five field hands of both sexes. The field in which they\r\nworked at that time, lay about two miles from the house; the hands had\r\nto cook and eat their breakfast, prepare their dinner, and be in the\r\nfield at daylight, and continue there till dark. In the evening the\r\ncotton they had picked was weighed, and if they fell short of their\r\ntask they were whipped. One night I attended the weighing--two women\r\nfell short of their task, and the master ordered the black driver to\r\ntake them to the quarters and flog them; one of them was to receive\r\ntwenty-five lashes and pick a peck of cotton seed. I have been with\r\nthe overseer several times through the negro quarters. The huts are\r\ngenerally built of split timber, some larger than rails, twelve and a\r\nhalf feet wide and fourteen feet long--some with and some without\r\nchimneys, and generally without floors; they were generally without\r\ndaubing, and mostly had split clapboards nailed on the cracks on the\r\noutside, though some were without even that: in some there was a kind\r\nof rough bedstead, made from rails, polished with the axe, and put\r\ntogether in a very rough manner, the bottom covered with clapboards,\r\nand over that a bundle of worn out clothes. In some huts there was no\r\nbedstead at all. The above description applies to the places generally\r\nwith which I was acquainted, and they were mostly _old settlements._\r\n\r\n\"In the east part of Jefferson county I built a chimney for a man\r\nnamed ---- M'Coy; he had forty-seven laboring hands. Near where I was\r\nat work, M'Coy had ordered one of his slaves to set a post for a gate.\r\nWhen he came to look at it, he said the slave had not set it in the\r\nright place; and ordered him to strip, and lie down on his face;\r\ntelling him that if he struggled, or attempted to get up, two men, who\r\nhad been called to the spot, should seize and hold him fast. The slave\r\nagreed to be quiet, and M'Coy commenced flogging him on the bare back,\r\nwith the wagon whip. After some time the sufferer attempted to get up;\r\none of the slaves standing by, seized him by the feet and held him\r\nfast; upon which he yielded, and M'Coy continued to flog him ten or\r\nfifteen minutes. When he was up, and had put on his trowsers, the\r\nblood came through them.\r\n\r\n\"About half a mile from M'Coy's was a plantation owned by his\r\nstep-daughter. The overseer's name was James Farr, of whom it appears\r\nMrs. M'Coy's waiting woman was enamoured. One night, while I lived\r\nthere, M'Coy came from Natchez, about 10 o'clock at night. He said\r\nthat Dinah was gone, and wished his overseer to go with him to Farr's\r\nlodgings. They went accordingly, one to each door, and caught Dinah as\r\nshe ran out, she was partly dressed in her mistress's clothes; M'Coy\r\nwhipped her unmercifully, and she afterwards made her escape. On the\r\nnext day, (Sabbath), M'Coy came to the overseer's, where I lodged, and\r\nrequested him and me to look for her, as he was afraid that she had\r\nhanged herself. He then gave me the particulars of the flogging. He\r\nstated that near Farr's he had made her strip and lie down, and had\r\nflogged her until he was tired; that before he reached home he had a\r\nsecond time made her strip, and again flogged her until he was tired;\r\nthat when he reached home he had tied her to a peach-tree, and after\r\ngetting a drink had flogged her until he was thirsty again; and while\r\nhe went to get a drink the woman made her escape. He stated that he\r\nknew, from the whipping he had given her, there must be in her back\r\ncuts an inch deep. He showed the place where she had been tied to the\r\ntree; there appeared to be as much blood as if a hog had been stuck\r\nthere. The woman was found on Sabbath evening, near the sprang, and\r\nhad to be carried into the house.\r\n\r\n\"While I lived there I heard M'Coy say, if the slaves did not raise\r\nhim three hundred bales of cotton the ensuing season, he would kill\r\nevery negro he had.\r\n\r\n\"Another case of flogging came under my notice: Philip O. Hughes,\r\nsheriff of Jefferson county, had hired a slave to a man, whose name I\r\ndo not recollect. On a Sabbath day the slave had drank somewhat\r\nfreely; he was ordered by the tavern keeper, (where his present master\r\nhad left his horse and the negro,) to stay in the kitchen; the negro\r\nwished to be out. In persisting to go out he was knocked down three\r\ntimes; and afterwards flogged until another young man and myself ran\r\nabout half a mile, having been drawn by the cries of the negro and the\r\nsound of the whip. When we came up, a number of men that had been\r\nabout the tavern, were whipping him, and at intervals would ask him if\r\nhe would take off his clothes. At seeing them drive down the stakes\r\nfor a regular flogging he yielded, and took them off. They then\r\nflogged him until satisfied. On the next morning I saw him, and his\r\npantaloons were all in a gore of blood.\r\n\r\n\"During my stay in Jefferson county, Philip O. Hughes was out one day\r\nwith his gun--he saw a negro at some distance, with a club in one hand\r\nand an ear of corn in the other--Hughes stepped behind a tree, and\r\nwaited his approach; he supposed the negro to be a runaway, who had\r\nescaped about nine months before from his master, living not very far\r\ndistant. The negro discovered Hughes before he came up, and started to\r\nrun; he refusing to stop, Hughes fired, and shot him through the arm.\r\nThrough loss of blood the negro was soon taken and put in jail. I saw\r\nhis wound twice dressed, and heard Hughes make the above statement.\r\n\r\n\"When in Jefferson county I boarded six weeks in Fayette, the county\r\ntown, with a tavern keeper named James Truly. He had a slave named\r\nLucy, who occupied the station of chamber maid and table waiter. One\r\nday, just after dinner Mrs. Truly took Lucy and bound her arms round a\r\npine sapling behind the house, and commenced flogging her with a\r\nriding-whip; and when tired would take her chair and rest. She\r\ncontinued thus alternately flogging and resting, for at least an hour\r\nand a half. I afterwards learned from the bar-keeper, and others, that\r\nthe woman's offence was that she had bought two candles to set on the\r\ntable the evening before, not knowing there were yet some in the box.\r\nI did nor see the act of flogging above related; but it was commenced\r\nbefore I left the house after dinner, and my work not being more than\r\ntwenty rods from the house, I distinctly heard the cries of the woman\r\nall the time, and the manner of tying I had from those who did see it.\r\n\r\n\"While I boarded at Truly's, an overseer shot a negro about two miles\r\nnorthwest of Fayette, belonging to a man named Hinds Stuart. I heard\r\nStuart himself state the particulars. It appeared that the negro's\r\nwife fell under the overseer's displeasure, and he went to whip her.\r\nThe negro said she should not be whipped. The overseer then let her\r\ngo, and ordered him to be seized. The negro, having been a driver,\r\nrolled the lash of his whip round his hand, and said he would not be\r\nwhipped at that time. The overseer repeated his orders. The negro took\r\nup a hoe, and none dared to take hold of him. The overseer then went\r\nto his coat, that he had laid off to whip the negro's wife, and took\r\nout his pistol and shot him dead. His master ordered him to be buried\r\nin a hole without a coffin. Stuart stated that he would not have taken\r\ntwo thousand dollars for him. No punishment was inflicted on the\r\noverseer.\r\n\r\nELEAZAR POWELL, Jr.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY ON THE AUTHORITY OF REV. WM. SCALES, LYNDON, VT\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract of a letter from two professional\r\ngentlemen and their wives, who have lived for some years in a small\r\nvillage in one of the slave states. They are all persons of the\r\nhighest respectability, and are well known in at least one of the New\r\nEngland states. Their names are with the Executive Committee of the\r\nAmerican Anti-Slavery Society; but as the individuals would doubtless\r\nbe murdered by the slaveholders, if they were published, the Committee\r\nfeel sacredly bound to withhold them. The letter was addressed to a\r\nrespected clergyman in New England. The writers say:\r\n\r\n\"A man near us owned a valuable slave--his best--most faithful servant.\r\nIn a gust of passion, he struck him dead with a lever, or stick of\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n\"During the years '36 and '37, the following transpired. A slave in\r\nour neighborhood ran away and went to a place about thirty miles\r\ndistant. There he was found by his pursuers on horseback, and\r\ncompelled by the whip to run the distance of thirty miles. It was an\r\nexceedingly hot day--and within a few hours after he arrived at the\r\nend of his journey the slave was dead.\r\n\r\n\"Another slave ran away, but concluded to return. He had proceeded\r\nsome distance on his return, when he was met by a company of two or\r\nthree drivers who raced, whipped and abused him until he fell down and\r\nexpired. This took place on the Sabbath.\" The writer after speaking of\r\nanother murder of a slave in the neighborhood, without giving the\r\ncircumstances, say--\"There is a powerful New England influence at\r\n----\" the village where they reside--\"We may therefore suppose that\r\nthere would he as little of barbarian cruelty practiced there as any\r\nwhere;--at least we might suppose that the average amount of cruelty\r\nin that vicinity would be sufficiently favorable to the side of\r\nslavery.--Describe a circle, the centre of which shall be--, the\r\nresidence of the writers, and the radius fifteen miles, and in about\r\none year three, and I think four slaves have been _murdered_, within\r\nthat circle, under circumstances of horrid cruelty.--What must have\r\nbeen the amount of murder in the whole slave territory? The whole\r\nsouth is rife with the crime of separating husbands and wives, parents\r\nand children.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JOSEPH IDE, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMr. IDE is a respected member of the Baptist Church in Sheffield,\r\nCaledonia county, Vt.; and recently the Postmaster in that town. He\r\nspent a few months at the south in the years 1837 and 8. In a letter\r\nto the Rev. Wm. Scales of Lyndon, Vt. written a few weeks since, Mr.\r\nIde writes as follows.\r\n\r\n\"In answering the proposed inquiries, I will say first, that although\r\nthere are various other modes resorted to, whipping with the cowskin\r\nis the usual mode of inflicting punishment on the poor slave. I have\r\nnever actually witnessed a whipping scene, for they are usually taken\r\ninto some back place for that purpose; but I have often heard their\r\ngroans and screams while writhing under the lash; and have seen the\r\nblood flow from their torn and lacerated skins after the vengeance of\r\nthe inhuman master or mistress had been glutted. You ask if the woman\r\nwhere I boarded whipped a slave to death. I can give you the\r\nparticulars of the transaction as they were related to me. My\r\ninformant was a gentleman--a member of the Presbyterian church in\r\nMassachusetts--who the winter before boarded where I did. He said that\r\nMrs. T---- had a female slave whom she used to whip unmercifully, and on\r\none occasion, she whipped her as long as she had strength, and after\r\nthe poor creature was suffered to go, she crawled off into a cellar.\r\nAs she did not immediately return, search was made, and she was found\r\ndead in the cellar, and the horrid deed was kept a secret in the\r\nfamily, and it was reported that she died of sickness. This wretch at\r\nthe same time was a member of a Presbyterian church. Towards her\r\nslaves she was certainly the most cruel wretch of any woman with whom\r\nI was ever acquainted--yet she was nothing more than a slaveholder.\r\nShe would deplore slavery as much as I did, and often told me she was\r\nmuch of an abolitionist as I was. She was constant in the declaration\r\nthat her kind treatment to her slaves was proverbial. Thought I, then\r\nthe Lord have mercy on the rest. She has often told me of the cruel\r\ntreatment of the slaves on a plantation adjoining her father's in the\r\nlow country of South Carolina. She says she has often seen them driven\r\nto the necessity of eating frogs and lizards to sustain life. As to\r\nthe mode of living generally, my information is rather limited, being\r\nwith few exceptions confined to the different families where I have\r\nboarded. My stopping places at the south have mostly been in cities.\r\nIn them the slaves are better fed and clothed than on plantations. The\r\nhouse servants are fed on what the families leave. But they are kept\r\nshort, and I think are oftener whipped for stealing something to eat\r\nthan any other crime. On plantations their food is principally\r\nhommony, as the southerners call it. It is simply cracked corn boiled.\r\nThis probably constitutes seven-eights of their living. The\r\nhouse-servants in cities are generally decently clothed, and some\r\nfavorite ones are richly dressed, but those on the plantations,\r\nespecially in their dress, if it can be called dress, exhibit the most\r\nhaggard and squalid appearance. I have frequently seen those of both\r\nsexes more than two-thirds naked. I have seen from forty to sixty,\r\nmale and female, at work in a field, many of both sexes with their\r\nbodies entirely naked--who did not exhibit signs of shame more than\r\ncattle. As I did not go among them much on the plantations, I have\r\nhad but few opportunities for examining the backs of slaves--but have\r\nfrequently passed where they were at work, and been occasionally\r\npresent with them, and in almost every case there were marks of\r\nviolence on some parts of them--every age, sex and condition being\r\nliable to the whip. A son of the gentleman with whom I boarded, a\r\nyoung man about twenty-one years of age, had a plantation and eight or\r\nten slaves. He used to boast almost every night of whipping some of\r\nthem. One day he related to me a case of whipping an old negro--I\r\nshould judge sixty years of age. He said he called him up to flog him\r\nfor some real or supposed offence, and the poor old man, being pious,\r\nasked the privilege of praying before he received his punishment. He\r\nsaid he granted him the favor, and to use his own expression, 'The old\r\nnigger knelt down and prayed for me, and then got up and took his\r\nwhipping.' In relation to negro huts, I will say that planters usually\r\nown large tracts of land. They have extensive clearings and a\r\nbeautiful mansion house--and generally some forty or fifty rods from\r\nthe dwelling are situated the negro cabins, or huts, built of logs in\r\nthe rudest manner. Some consist of poles rolled up together and\r\ncovered with mud or clay--many of them not as comfortable as northern\r\npig-sties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF REV. PHINEAS SMITH\r\n\r\nMR. SMITH is now pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Centreville,\r\nAllegany county, N.Y. He has recently returned from a residence in the\r\nslave states, and the American slave holding settlements in Texas. The\r\nfollowing is an extract of a letter lately received from him.\r\n\r\n\"You inquire respecting instances of cruelty that have come within my\r\nknowledge. I reply. Avarice and cruelty constitute the very gist of\r\nthe whole slave system. Many of the enormities committed upon the\r\nplantations will not be described till God brings to light the hidden\r\nthings of darkness, then the tears and groans and blood of innocent\r\nmen, women and children will be revealed, and the oppressor's spirit\r\nmust confront that of his victim.\r\n\r\n\"I will relate a case of _torture_ which occurred on the Brassos while\r\nI resided a few miles distant upon the Chocolate Bayou. The case\r\nshould be remembered as a true illustration of the nature of slavery,\r\nas it exists at the south. The facts are these. An overseer by the\r\nname of Alexander, notorious for his cruelty, was found dead in the\r\ntimbered lands of the Brassos. It was supposed that he was murdered,\r\nbut who perpetrated the act was unknown. Two black men were however\r\nseized, taken into the Prairie and put to the torture. A physician by\r\nthe name of Parrott from Tennessee, and another from New England by\r\nthe name of Anson Jones, were present on this occasion. The latter\r\ngentleman is now the Texan minister plenipotentiary to the United\r\nStates, and resides at Washington. The unfortunate slaves being\r\nstripped, and all things arranged, the torture commenced by whipping\r\nupon their bare backs. Six athletic men were employed in this scene of\r\ninhumanity, the names of some of whom I well remember. There was one\r\nof the name of Brown, and one or two of the name of Patton. Those six\r\nexecutioners were successively employed in cutting up the bodies of\r\nthese defenceless slaves, who persisted to the last in the avowal of\r\ntheir innocence. The bloody whip was however kept in motion till\r\nsavage barbarity itself was glutted. When this was accomplished, the\r\nbleeding victims were re-conveyed to the inclosure of the mansion\r\nhouse where they were deposited for a few moments. '_The dying groans\r\nhowever incommoding the ladies, they were taken to a back shed where\r\none of them soon expired_.'[13] The life of the other slave was for a\r\ntime despaired of, but after hanging over the grave for months, he at\r\nlength so far recovered as to walk about and labor at light work.\r\nThese facts _cannot be controverted_. They were disclosed under the\r\nsolemnity of an oath, at Columbia, in a court of justice. I was\r\npresent, and shall never forget them. The testimony of Drs. Parrott\r\nand Jones was most appalling. I seem to hear the death-groans of that\r\nmurdered man. His cries for mercy and protestations of innocence fell\r\nupon adamantine hearts. The facts above stated, and others in relation\r\nto this scene of cruelty came to light in the following manner. The\r\nmaster of the murdered man commenced legal process against the actors\r\nin this tragedy for the _recovery of the value of the chattel_, as one\r\nwould institute a suit for a horse or an ox that had been unlawfully\r\nkilled. It was a suit for the recovery of _damages_ merely. No\r\n_indictment_ was even dreamed of. Among the witnesses brought upon the\r\nstand in the progress of this cause were the physicians, Parrott and\r\nJones above named. The part which they were called to act in this\r\naffair was, it is said, to examine the pulse of the victims during the\r\nprocess of _torture_. But they were mistaken as to the quantum of\r\ntorture which a human being can undergo and not die under it. Can it\r\nbe believed that one of these physicians was born and educated in the\r\nland of the pilgrims? Yes, in my own native New England. It is even\r\nso! The stone-like apathy manifested at the trial of the above cause,\r\nand the screams and the death-groans of an innocent man, as developed\r\nby the testimony of the witnesses, can never be obliterated from my\r\nmemory. They form an era in my life, a point to which I look back with\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The words of Dr. Parrott, a witness on the trial hereafter\r\nreferred to.]\r\n\r\n\"Another case of cruelty occurred on the San Bernard near Chance\r\nPrairie, where I resided for some time. The facts were these. A slave\r\nman fled from his master, (Mr. Sweeny) and being closely _pursued_ by\r\nthe overseer and a son of the owner, he stepped a few yards in the\r\nBernard and placed himself upon a root, from which there was no\r\npossibility of his escape, for he could not swim. In this situation he\r\nwas fired upon with a blunderbuss loaded heavily with ball and grape\r\nshot. The overseer who shot the gun was at a distance of a few feet\r\nonly. The charge entered the body of the negro near the groin. He was\r\nconveyed to the plantation, lingered in inexpressible agony a few days\r\nand expired. A physician was called, but medical and surgical skill\r\nwas unavailing. No notice whatever was taken of this murder by the\r\npublic authorities, and the murderer was not discharged from the\r\nservice of his employer.\r\n\r\n\"When slaves flee, as they not unfrequently do, to the timbered lands\r\nof Texas, they are hunted with guns and dogs.\r\n\r\n\"The sufferings of the slave not unfrequently drive him to despair and\r\nsuicide. At a plantation on the San Bernard, where there were but five\r\nslaves, two during the same year committed suicide by drowning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF PHILEMON BLISS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMr. Bliss is a highly respectable member of the bar, in Elyria, Lorain\r\nCo. Ohio, and member of the Presbyterian church, in that place. He\r\nresided in Florida, during the years 1834 and 5.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from letters, written by Mr. B. in 1835,\r\nwhile residing on a plantation near Tallahassee, and published soon\r\nafter in the Ohio Atlas; also from letters written in 1836 and\r\npublished in the New York Evangelist.\r\n\r\n\"In speaking of slavery as it is, I hardly know where to begin. The\r\nphysical condition of the slave is far from being accurately known at\r\nthe north. Gentlemen _traveling_ in the south can know nothing of it.\r\nThey must make the south their residence; they must live on\r\nplantations, before they can have any opportunity of judging of the\r\nslave. I resided in Augustine five months, and had I not made\r\n_particular_ inquiries, which most northern visitors very seldom or\r\nnever do, I should have left there with the impression that the slaves\r\nwere generally very _well_ treated, and were a happy people. Such is\r\nthe report of many northern travelers who have no more opportunity of\r\nknowing their real condition than if they had remained at home. What\r\nconfidence could we place in the reports of the traveler, relative to\r\nthe condition of the Irish peasantry, who formed his opinion from the\r\nappearance of the waiters at a Dublin hotel, or the household servants\r\nof a country gentleman? And it is not often on plantations even, that\r\n_strangers_ can witness the punishment of the slave. I was conversing\r\nthe other day with a neighboring planter, upon the brutal treatment of\r\nthe slaves which I had witnessed: he remarked, that had I been with\r\nhim I should not have seen this. \"When I whip niggers, I take them out\r\nof sight and hearing.\" Such being the difficulties in the way of a\r\nstranger's ascertaining the treatment of the slaves, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that gentlemen, of undoubted veracity, should give\r\ndirectly false statements relative to it. But facts cannot lie, and in\r\ngiving these I confine myself to what has come under my own personal\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\"The negroes commence labor by daylight in the morning, and, excepting\r\nthe plowboys, who must feed and rest their horses, do not leave the\r\nfield till dark in the evening. There is a good deal of contention\r\namong planters, who shall make the most cotton to the hand, or, who\r\nshall drive their negroes the hardest; and I have heard bets made and\r\nstaked upon the issue of the crops. Col. W. was boasting of his large\r\ncrops, and swore that 'he made for his force, the largest crops in the\r\ncountry.' He was disputed of course. On riding home in company with\r\nMr. C. the conversation turned upon Col. W. My companion remarked,\r\nthat though Col. W. had the reputation of making a large crop, yet he\r\ncould beat him himself, and did do it the last year. I remarked that I\r\nconsidered it no honor to _Col. W_. to drive his slaves to death to\r\nmake a large crop. I have heard no more about large crops from him\r\nsince. Drivers or overseers usually drive the slaves worse than\r\nmasters.--Their reputation for good overseers depends in a great\r\nmeasure upon the crops they make, and the death of a slave is no loss\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\"Of the extent and cruelty of the punishment of the slave, the\r\nnorthern public know nothing. From the nature of the case they can\r\nknow little, as I have before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"I _have seen_ a woman, a mother, compelled, in the presence of her\r\nmaster and mistress, _to hold up her clothes_, and endure the whip of\r\nthe driver on the naked body for more than _twenty minutes_, and while\r\nher cries would have rent the heart of any one, who had not hardened\r\nhimself to human suffering. Her master and mistress were conversing\r\nwith apparent indifference. What was her crime? She had a task given\r\nher of sewing which she _must finish_ that day. Late at night she\r\nfinished it; but _the stitches were too long_, and she must be\r\nwhipped. The same was repeated three or four nights for the same\r\noffence. _I have seen_ a man tied to a tree, hands and feet, and\r\nreceive 305 blows with the paddle[14] on the fleshy parts of the body.\r\nTwo others received the same kind of punishment at the time, though I\r\ndid not count the blows. One received 230 lashes. Their crime was\r\nstealing mutton. I have _frequently_ heard the shrieks of the slaves,\r\nmale and female, accompanied by the strokes of the paddle or whip,\r\nwhen I have not gone near the scene of horror. I knew not their\r\ncrimes, excepting of one woman, which was stealing _four potatoes_ to\r\neat with her bread! The more common number of lashes inflicted was\r\nfifty or eighty; and this I saw not once or twice, but so frequently\r\nthat I can not tell the number of times I have seen it. So frequently,\r\nthat my own heart was becoming so hardened that I could witness with\r\ncomparative indifference, the female writhe under the lash, and her\r\nshrieks and cries for mercy ceased to pierce my heart with that\r\nkeenness, or give me that anguish which they first caused. It was not\r\nalways that I could learn their crimes; but of those I did learn, the\r\nmost common was non-performance of tasks. I have seen men strip and\r\nreceive from one to three hundred strokes of the whip and paddle. My\r\nstudies and meditations were almost nightly interrupted by the cries\r\nof the victims of cruelty and avarice. Tom, a slave of Col. N.\r\nobtained permission of his overseer on Sunday, to visit his son, on a\r\nneighboring plantation, belonging in part to his master, but neglected\r\nto take a \"pass.\" Upon its being demanded by the other overseer, he\r\nreplied that he had permission to come, and that his having a mule was\r\nsufficient evidence of it, and if he did not consider it as such, he\r\ncould take him up. The overseer replied he would take him up; giving\r\nhim at the same time a blow on the arm with a stick he held in his\r\nhand, sufficient to lame it for some time. The negro collared him, and\r\nthrew him; and on the overseer's commanding him to submit to be tied\r\nand whipped, he said he would not be whipped by _him_ but would leave\r\nit to massa J. They came to massa J.'s. I was there. After the\r\noverseer had related the case as above, he was blamed for not shooting\r\nor stabbing him at once.--After dinner the negro was tied, and the\r\nwhip given to the overseer, and he used it with a severity that was\r\nshocking. I know not how many lashes were given, but from his\r\nshoulders to his heels there was not a spot unridged! and at almost\r\nevery stroke the blood flowed. He could not have received less than\r\n300, _well laid on_. But his offence was great, almost the greatest\r\nknown, laying hands on a _white_ man! Had he struck the overseer,\r\nunder any provocation, he would have been in some way disfigured,\r\nperhaps by the loss of his ears, in addition to a whipping: or he\r\nmight have been hung. The most common cause of punishments is, not\r\nfinishing tasks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: A piece of oak timber two and a half feet long, flat and\r\nwide at one end.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But it would be tedious mentioning further particulars. The negro has\r\nno other inducement to work but the _lash_; and as man never acts\r\nwithout motive, the lash must be used so long as all other motives are\r\nwithheld. Hence corporeal punishment is a necessary part of slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Punishments for runaways are usually severe. Once whipping is not\r\nsufficient. I have known runaways to be whipped for six or seven\r\nnights in succession for one offence. I have known others who, with\r\npinioned hands, and a chain extending from an iron collar on their\r\nneck, to the saddle of their master's horse, have been driven at a\r\nsmart trot, one or two hundred miles, being compelled to ford water\r\ncourses, their drivers, according to their own confession, not abating\r\na whit in the rapidity of their journey for the case of the slave. One\r\ntied a kettle of sand to his slave to render his journey more arduous.\r\n\r\n\"Various are the instruments of torture devised to keep the slave in\r\nsubjection. The stocks are sometimes used. Sometimes blocks are filled\r\nwith pegs and nails, and the slave compelled to stand upon them.\r\n\r\n\"While stopping on the plantation of a Mr. C. I saw a whip with a\r\nknotted lash lying on the table, and inquired of my companion, who was\r\nalso an acquaintance of Mr. C's, if he used that to whip his negroes?\r\n\"Oh,\" says he, \"Mr. C. is not severe with his hands. He never whips\r\nvery hard. The _knots in the lash are so large_ that he does not\r\nusually draw blood in whipping them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was principally from hearing the conversation of southern men on\r\nthe subject, that I judge of the cruelty that is generally practiced\r\ntoward slaves. They will deny that slaves are generally ill treated;\r\nbut ask them if they are not whipped for certain offences, which\r\neither a freeman would have no temptation to commit, or which would\r\nnot be an offence in any but a slave, and for non-performance of\r\ntasks, they will answer promptly in the affirmative. And frequently\r\nhave I heard them excuse their cruelty by citing Mr. A. or Mr. B. who\r\nis a Christian, or Mr. C. a preacher, or Mr. D. from the _north_, who\r\n\"drives his hands tighter, and whips them harder, than we ever do.\"\r\nDriving negroes to the utmost extent of their ability, with\r\noccasionally a hundred lashes or more, and a few switchings in the\r\nfield if they hang back in the driving seasons, viz: in the hoing and\r\npicking months, is perfectly consistent with good treatment!\r\n\r\n\"While traveling across the Peninsula in a stage, in company with a\r\nnorthern gentleman, and southern lady, of great worth and piety, a\r\ndispute arose respecting the general treatment of slaves, the\r\ngentleman contending that their treatment was generally good--'O, no!'\r\ninterrupted the lady, 'you can know nothing of the treatment they\r\nreceive on the plantations. People here do whip the poor negroes most\r\ncruelly, and many half starve them. You have neither of you had\r\nopportunity to know scarcely anything of the cruelties that are\r\npracticed in this country,' and more to the same effect. I met with\r\nseveral others, besides this lady, who appeared to feel for the sins\r\nof the land, but they are few and scattered, and not usually of\r\nsufficiently stern mould to withstand the popular wave.\r\n\r\n\"Masters are not forward to publish their \"domestic regulations,\" and\r\nas neighbors are usually several miles apart, one's observation must\r\nbe limited. Hence the few instances of cruelty which break out can be\r\nbut a fraction of what is practised. A planter, a professor of\r\nreligion, in conversation upon the universality of whipping, remarked\r\nthat a planter in G--, who had whipped a great deal, at length got\r\ntired of it, and invented the following _excellent_ method of\r\npunishment, which I saw practised while I was paying him a visit. The\r\nnegro was placed in a sitting position, with his hands made fast above\r\nhis head, and feet in the stocks, so that he could not move any part\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n\"The master retired, intending to leave him till morning, but we were\r\nawakened in the night by the groans of the negro, which were so\r\ndoleful that we feared he was dying. We went to him, and found him\r\ncovered with a cold sweat, and almost gone. He could not have lived an\r\nhour longer. Mr. ---- found the 'stocks' such an effective punishment,\r\nthat it almost superseded the whip.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much do you give your niggers for a task while hoeing cotton,\"\r\ninquired Mr. C---- of his neighbor Mr. H----.\"\r\n\r\nH. \"I give my men an acre and a quarter, and my women an acre.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Cotton is planted in drills about three feet apart, and\r\nis hilled like corn.]\r\n\r\n\r\nC. \"Well, that is a fair task. Niggers do a heap better if they are\r\ndrove pretty tight.\"\r\n\r\nH. \"O yes, I have driven mine into complete subordination. When I\r\nfirst bought them they were discontented and wished me to sell them,\r\nbut I soon whipped _that_ out of them; and they now work very\r\ncontentedly!\"\r\n\r\nC. \"Does Mary keep up with the rest?\"\r\n\r\nH. \"No, she does'nt often finish the task alone, she has to get Sam to\r\nhelp her out after he has done his, _to save her a whipping_. There's\r\nno other way but to be severe with them.\"\r\n\r\nC. \"No other, sir, if you favor a nigger you spoil him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whip is considered as necessary on a plantation as the plough;\r\nand its use is almost as common. The negro whip is the common\r\nteamster's whip with a black leather stock, and a short, fine, knotted\r\nlash. The paddle is also frequently used, sometimes with holes bored\r\nin the flattened end. The ladies (!) in chastising their domestic\r\nservants, generally use the cowhide. I have known some use shovel and\r\ntongs. It is, however, more common to commit them to the driver to be\r\nwhipped. The manner of whipping is as follows: The negro is tied by\r\nhis hands, and sometimes feet, to a post or tree, and stripped to the\r\nskin. The female slave is not always tied. The number of lashes\r\ndepends upon the character for severity of the master or overseer.\r\n\r\n\"Another instrument of torture is sometimes used, how extensively I\r\nknow not. The negro, or, in the case which came to my knowledge, the\r\nnegress was compelled to stand barefoot upon a block filled with sharp\r\npegs and nails for two or three hours. In case of sickness, if the\r\nmaster or overseer thinks them seriously ill, they are taken care of,\r\nbut their complaints are usually not much heeded. A physician told me\r\nthat he was employed by a planter last winter to go to a plantation of\r\nhis in the country, as many of the negroes were sick. Says he--\"I\r\nfound them in a most miserable condition. The weather was cold, and\r\nthe negroes were barefoot, with hardly enough of _cotton_ clothing to\r\ncover their nakedness. Those who had huts to shelter them were obliged\r\nto build them nights and Sundays. Many were sick and some had died. I\r\nhad the sick taken to an older plantation of their masters, where they\r\ncould be made comfortable, and they recovered. I directed that they\r\nshould not go to work till after sunrise, and should not work in the\r\nrain till their health became established. But the overseer refusing\r\nto permit it, I declined attending on them farther. I was called,'\r\ncontinued he, 'by the overseer of another plantation to see one of the\r\nmen. I found him lying by the side of a log in great pain. I asked him\r\nhow he did, 'O,' says he, 'I'm most dead, can live but little longer.'\r\nHow long have you been sick? I've felt for more than six weeks as\r\nthough I could hardly stir.' Why didn't you tell your master, you was\r\nsick? 'I couldn't see my master, and the overseer always whips us when\r\nwe complain, I could not stand a whipping.' I did all I could for the\r\npoor fellow, but his _lungs were rotten_. He died in three days from\r\nthe time he left off work.' The cruelty of that overseer is such that\r\nthe negroes almost tremble at his name. Yet he gets a high salary, for\r\nhe makes the largest crop of any other man in the neighborhood, though\r\nnone but the hardiest negroes can stand it under him. \"That man,\" says\r\nthe Doctor, \"would be hung in my country.\" He was a German.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF REV. WILLIAM A. CHAPIN.\r\n\r\nREV. WILLIAM SCALES, of Lyndon, Vermont, has furnished the following\r\ntestimony, under date of Dec. 15, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"I send you an extract from a letter that I have just received, which\r\nyou may use _ad libitum_. The letter is from Rev. Wm. A. Chapin,\r\nGreensborough, Vermont. To one who is acquainted with Mr. C. his\r\nopinion and statements must carry conviction even to the most\r\nobstinate and incredulous. He observes, 'I resided, as a teacher,\r\nnearly two years in the family of Carroll Webb, Esq., of Hampstead,\r\nNew Kent co. about twenty miles from Richmond, Virginia. Mr. Webb had\r\nthree or four plantations, and was considered one of the two\r\nwealthiest men in the county: it was supposed he owned about two\r\nhundred slaves. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church, and was\r\nelected an elder while I was with him. He was a native of Virginia,\r\nbut a graduate of a New-England college.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves were called in the morning before daylight, I believe at\r\nall seasons of the year, that they might prepare their food, and be\r\nready to go to work as soon as it was light enough to see. I know that\r\nat the season of husking corn, October and November, they were usually\r\ncompelled to work late--till 12 or 1 o'clock at night. I know this\r\nfact because they accompanied their work with a loud singing of their\r\nown sort. I usually retired to rest between 11 and 12 o'clock, and\r\ngenerally heard them at their work as long as I was awake. The slaves\r\nlived in wretched log cabins, of one room each, without floors or\r\nwindows. I believe the slaves sometimes suffer for want of food. One\r\nevening, as I was sitting in the parlor with Mr. W. one of the most\r\nresolute of the slaves came to the door, and said, \"Master, I am\r\nwilling to work for you, but I want something to eat.\" The only reply\r\nwas, \"Clear yourself.\" I learned that the slaves had been without food\r\nall day, because the man who was sent to mill could not obtain his\r\ngrinding. He went again the next day, and obtained his grist, and the\r\nslaves had no food till he returned. He had to go about five\r\nmiles.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: To this, Rev. Mr. Scales adds, \"In familiar language, and\r\nin more detail, as I have learned it in conversation with Mr. Chapin,\r\nthe fact is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. W. kept, what he called a 'boy,' i.e. a _man_, to go to mill. It\r\nwas his custom not to give his slaves anything to eat while he was\r\ngone to mill--let him have been gone longer or shorter--for this\r\nreason, if he was lazy, and delayed, the slaves would become hungry:\r\nhence indignant, and abuse him--this was his punishment. On that\r\noccasion he went to mill in the morning. The slaves came up at noon,\r\nand returned to work without food. At night, after having worked hard\r\nall day, without food, went to bed without supper. About 10 o'clock\r\nthe next day, they came up in a company, to their master's door, (that\r\nmaster an elder in the church), and deputed one more resolute than the\r\nrest to address him. This he did in the most respectful tones and\r\nterms. \"We are willing to work for you, master, but we can't work\r\nwithout food; we want something to eat.\" \"Clear yourself,\" was the\r\nanswer. The slaves retired; and in the morning were driven away to\r\nwork without food. At noon, I think, or somewhat after, they were\r\nfed.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I know the slaves were sometimes severely whipped. I saw the backs of\r\nseveral which had numerous scars, evidently caused by long and deep\r\nlacerations of the whip; and I have good reason to believe that the\r\nslaves were generally in that condition; for I never saw the back of\r\none exposed that was not thus marked,--and from their tattered and\r\nscanty clothing their backs were often exposed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MESSRS. T.D.M. AND F.C. MACY.\r\n\r\nThis testimony is communicated in a letter from Mr. Cyrus Pierce, a\r\nrespectable and well known citizen of Nantucket, Mass. Of the\r\nwitnesses, Messrs. T.D.M. and F.C. Macy, Mr. Pierce says, \"They are\r\nboth inhabitants of this island, and have resided at the south; they\r\nare both worthy men, for whose integrity and intelligence I can vouch\r\nunqualifiedly; the former has furnished me with the following\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\"During the winter of 1832-3, I resided on the island of St. Simon,\r\nGlynn county, Georgia. There are several extensive cotton plantations\r\non the island. The overseer of the plantation on that part of the\r\nisland where I resided was a Georgian--a man of stern character, and\r\nat times _cruelly abusive_ to his slaves. I have often been witness of\r\nthe _abuse_ of his power. In South Carolina and Georgia, on the low\r\nlands, the cultivation is chiefly of rice. The land where it is raised\r\nis often inundated, and the labor of preparing it, and raising a crop,\r\nis very arduous. Men and women are in the field from earliest dawn to\r\ndark--often _without hats_, and up to their arm-pits in mud and water.\r\nAt St. Simon's, cotton was the staple article. Ocra, the driver,\r\nusually waited on the overseer to receive orders for the succeeding\r\nday. If any slave was insolent, or negligent, the driver was\r\nauthorized to punish him with the whip, with as many blows as the\r\nmagnitude of the crime justified. He was frequently cautioned, upon\r\nthe peril of his skin, to see that all the negroes were off to the\r\nfield in the morning. 'Ocra,' said the overseer, one evening, to the\r\ndriver, 'if any pretend to be sick, send me word--allow no lazy wench\r\nor fellow to skulk in the negro house.' Next morning, a few minutes\r\nafter the departure of the hands to the field, Ocra was seen hastening\r\nto the house of the overseer. He was soon in his presence. 'Well, Ocra,\r\nwhat now?' 'Nothing, sir, only Rachel says she sick--can't go to de\r\nfield to-day.' 'Ah, sick, is she? I'll see to her; you may be off. She\r\nshall see if I am longer to be fooled with in this way. Here,\r\nChristmas, mix these salts--bring them to me at the negro house.' And\r\nseizing his whip, he made off to the negro settlement. Having a strong\r\ndesire to see what would be the result, I followed him. As I\r\napproached the negro house, I heard high words. Rachel was stating her\r\ncomplaint--children were crying from fright--and the overseer\r\nthreatening. Rachel.--'I can't work to-day--I'm sick!' Overseer.--'But\r\nyou shall work, if you die for it. Here, take these salts. Now move\r\noff--quick--let me see your face again before night, and, by G--d,\r\nyou shall smart for it. Be off--no begging--not a word;'--and he\r\ndragged her from the house, and followed her 20 or 30 rods,\r\nthreatening. The woman did not reach the field. Overcome by the\r\nexertion of walking, and by agitation, she sunk down exhausted by the\r\nroad side--was taken up, and carried back to the house, where an\r\n_abortion_ occurred, and her life was greatly jeoparded.\r\n\r\n\"It was _no uncommon_ sight to see a whole family, father, mother, and\r\nfrom two to five children, collected together around their piggin of\r\nhommony, or pail of potatoes, watched by the overseer. One meal was\r\nalways eaten in the field. No time was allowed for relaxation.\r\n\r\n\"It was not unusual for a child of five or six years to perform the\r\noffice of nurse--because the mother worked in a remote part of the\r\nfield, and was not allowed to leave her employment to take care of her\r\ninfant. Want of proper nutriment induces sickness of the worst type.\r\n\r\n\"No matter what the nature of the service, a peck of corn, dealt out\r\non Sunday, must supply the demands of nature for a week.\r\n\r\n\"The Sabbath, on a southern plantation, is a mere nominal holiday. The\r\nslaves are liable to be called upon at all times, by those who have\r\nauthority over them.\r\n\r\n\"When it rained, the slaves were allowed to collect under a tree until\r\nthe shower had passed. Seldom, on a week day, were they permitted to\r\ngo to their huts during rain; and even had this privilege been\r\ngranted, many of those miserable habitations were in so dilapidated a\r\ncondition, that they would afford little or no protection. Negro huts\r\nare built of logs, covered with boards or thatch, having _no\r\nflooring_, and but one apartment, serving all the purposes of\r\nsleeping, cooking, &c. Some are furnished with a temporary loft. I\r\nhave seen a whole family herded together in a loft ten feet by twelve.\r\nIn cold weather, they gather around the fire, spread their blankets\r\n_on the ground_, and keep as comfortable as they can. Their supply of\r\nclothing is scanty--each slave being allowed a Holland coat and\r\npantaloons, of the coarsest manufacture, and one pair of cowhide\r\nshoes. The women, enough of the same kind of cloth for one frock. They\r\nhave also one pair of shoes. Shoes are given to the slaves in the\r\nwinter only. In summer, their clothing is composed of osnaburgs.\r\nSlaves on different plantations are not allowed without a written\r\npermission, to visit their fellow bondsmen, under penalty of severe\r\nchastisement. I witnessed the chastisement of a young male slave, who\r\nwas found lurking about the plantation, and could give no other\r\naccount of himself, than that he wanted to visit some of his\r\nacquaintance. Fifty lashes was the penalty for this offence. I could\r\nnot endure the dreadful shrieks of the tortured slave, and rushed away\r\nfront the scene.\"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this testimony is furnished by Mr. F.C. Macy.\r\n\r\n\"I went to Savannah in 1820. Sailing up the river, I had my first view\r\nof slavery. A large number of men and women, with _a piece of board on\r\ntheir heads, carrying mud_, for the purpose of dyking, near the river.\r\nAfter tarrying a while in Savannah, I went down to the sea islands of\r\nDe Fuskee and Hilton Head, where I spent six months. Negro houses are\r\nsmall, built of rough materials, _and no floor_. Their clothing, (one\r\nsuit,) coarse; which they received on Christmas day. Their food was\r\nthree pecks of potatoes per week, in the potatoe season, and one peck\r\nof corn the remainder of the year. The slaves carried with them into\r\nthe field their meal, and a gourd of water. They cooked their hommony\r\nin the field, and ate it with a wooden paddle. Their treatment was\r\nlittle better than that of brutes. _Whipping_ was nearly an every-day\r\npractice. On Mr. M----'s plantation, at the island De Fuskee, I saw an\r\nold man whipped; he was about 60. He had no clothing on, except a\r\nshirt. The man that inflicted the blows was Flim, a tall and stout\r\nman. The whipping was _very severe_. I inquired into the cause. Some\r\nvegetables had been stolen from his master's garden, of which he could\r\ngive no account. I saw several women whipped, some of whom were in\r\nvery _delicate_ circumstances. The case of one I will relate. She had\r\nbeen purchased in Charleston, and separated from her husband. On her\r\npassage to Savannah, or rather to the island, she was delivered of a\r\nchild; and in about three weeks after this, she appeared to be\r\nderanged. She would leave her work, go into the woods, and sing. Her\r\nmaster sent for her, and ordered the driver to whip her. I was near\r\nenough to hear the strokes.\r\n\r\n\"I have known negro boys, partly by persuasion, and partly by force,\r\nmade to strip off their clothing and fight for _the amusement of their\r\nmasters_. They would fight until both got to crying.\r\n\r\n\"One of the planters told me that his boat had been used without\r\npermission. A number of his negroes were called up, and put in a\r\nbuilding that was lathed and shingled. The covering could be easily\r\nremoved from the inside. He called one out for examination. While\r\nexamining this one, he discovered another negro, coming out of the\r\nroof. He ordered him back: he obeyed. In a few moments he attempted it\r\nagain. The master took deliberate aim at his head, but his gun missed\r\nfire. He told me he should probably have killed him, had his gun gone\r\noff. The negro jumped and run. The master took aim again, and fired;\r\nbut he was so far distant, that he received only a few shots in the\r\ncalf of his leg. After several days he returned, and received a severe\r\nwhipping.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. B----, planter at Hilton Head, freely confessed, that he kept one\r\nof his slaves as a mistress. She slept in the same room with him.\r\nThis, I think, is a very common practice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF A CLERGYMAN.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written to Mr. ARTHUR TAPPAN, of New York, in\r\nthe summer of 1833. As the name of the writer cannot be published with\r\nsafety to himself, it is withheld.\r\n\r\nThe following testimonials, from Mr. TAPPAN, Professor WRIGHT, and\r\nTHOMAS RITTER, M.D. of New York, establish the trust-worthiness and\r\nhigh respectability of the writer.\r\n\r\n\"I received the following letters from the south during the year 1833.\r\nThey were written by a gentleman who had then resided some years in\r\nthe slave states. Not being at liberty to give the writer's name, I\r\ncheerfully certify that he is a gentleman of established character, a\r\ngraduate of Yale College, and a respected minister of the gospel.\r\n\r\n\"ARTHUR TAPPAN.\"\r\n\r\n\"My acquaintance with the writer of the following letter commenced, I\r\nbelieve, in 1823, from which time we were fellow students in Yale\r\nCollege till 1826. I have occasionally seen him since. His character,\r\nso far as it has come within my knowledge, has been that of an upright\r\nand remarkably _candid_ man. I place great confidence both in his\r\nhabits of careful and unprejudiced observation and his veracity.\r\n\r\n\"E. WRIGHT, jun. New York, April 13, 1839.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been acquainted with the writer of the following letter about\r\ntwelve years, and know him to be a gentleman of high respectability,\r\nintegrity, and piety. We were fellow students in Yale College, and my\r\nopportunities for judging of his character, both at that time and\r\nsince our graduation, have been such, that I feel myself fully\r\nwarranted in making the above unequivocal declaration.\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS RITTER. 104, Cherry-street, New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"NATCHEZ, 1833.\r\n\r\n\"It has been almost four years since I came to the south-west; and\r\nalthough I have been told, from month to month, that I should soon\r\nwear off my northern prejudices, and probably have slaves of my own,\r\nyet my judgment in regard to oppression, or my prejudices, if they are\r\npleased so to call them, remain with me still. I judge still from\r\nthose principles which were fixed in my mind at the north; and a\r\nresidence at the south has not enabled me so to pervert truth, as to\r\nmake injustice appear justice.\r\n\r\n\"I have studied the state of things here, now for years, coolly and\r\ndeliberately, with the eye of an uninterested looker on; and hence I\r\nmay not be altogether unprepared to state to you some facts, and to\r\ndraw conclusions from them.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me then to relate what I have seen; and do not imagine that\r\nthese are all exceptions to the general treatment, but rather believe\r\nthat thousands of cruelties are practised in this Christian land,\r\nevery year, which no eye that ever shed a tear of pity could look\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after my arrival I made an excursion into the country, to the\r\ndistance of some twenty miles. And as I was passing by a cotton field,\r\nwhere about fifty negroes were at work, I was inclined to stop by the\r\nroad side to view a scene which was then new to me. While I was, in my\r\nmind, comparing this mode of labor with that of my own native place, I\r\nheard the driver, with a rough oath, order one that was near him, who\r\nseemed to be laboring to the extent of his power, to \"lie down.\" In a\r\nmoment he was obeyed; and he commenced whipping the offender upon his\r\nnaked back, and continued, to the amount of about twenty lashes, with\r\na heavy raw-hide whip, the crack of which might have been heard more\r\nthan half a mile. Nor did the females escape; for although I stopped\r\nscarcely fifteen minutes, no less than three were whipped in the same\r\nmanner, and that so severely, I was strongly inclined to interfere.\r\n\r\n\"You may be assured, sir, that I remained not unmoved: I could no\r\nlonger look on such cruelty, but turned away and rode on, while the\r\nechoes of the lash were reverberating in the woods around me. Such\r\nscenes have long since become familiar to me. But then the full effect\r\nwas not lost; and I shall never forget, to my latest day, the mingled\r\nfeelings of pity, horror, and indignation that took possession of my\r\nmind. I involuntarily exclaimed, O God of my fathers, how dost thou\r\npermit such things to defile our land! Be merciful to us! and visit us\r\nnot in justice, for all our iniquities and the iniquities of our\r\nfathers!\r\n\r\n\"As I passed on I soon found that I had escaped from one horrible\r\nscene only to witness another. A planter with whom I was well\r\nacquainted, had caught a negro without a pass. And at the moment I was\r\npassing by, he was in the act of fastening his feet and hands to the\r\ntrees, having previously made him take off all his clothing except his\r\ntrowsers. When he had sufficiently secured this poor creature, he beat\r\nhim for several minutes with a green switch more than six feet long;\r\nwhile he was writhing with anguish, endeavoring in vain to break the\r\ncords with which he was bound, and incessantly crying out, \"Lord,\r\nmaster! do pardon me this time! do, master, have mercy!\" These\r\nexpressions have recurred to me a thousand times since; and although\r\nthey came from one that is not considered among the sons of men, yet I\r\nthink they are well worthy of remembrance, as they might lead a wise\r\nman to consider whether such shall receive mercy from the righteous\r\nJudge, as never showed mercy to their fellow men.\r\n\r\n\"At length I arrived at the dwelling of a planter of my acquaintance,\r\nwith whom I passed the night. At about eight o'clock in the evening I\r\nheard the barking of several dogs, mingled with the most agonizing\r\ncries that I ever heard from any human being. Soon after the gentleman\r\ncame in, and began to apologize, by saying that two of his runaway\r\nslaves had just been brought home; and as he had previously tried\r\nevery species of punishment upon them without effect, he knew not what\r\nelse to add, except to set his blood hounds upon them. 'And,'\r\ncontinued he, 'one of them has been so badly bitten that he has been\r\ntrying to die. I am only sorry that he did not; for then I should not\r\nhave been further troubled with him. If he lives I intend to send him\r\nto Natchez or to New Orleans, to work with the ball and chain.'\r\n\r\n\"From this last remark I understood that private individuals have the\r\nright of thus subjecting their unmanageable slaves. I have since seen\r\nnumbers of these 'ball and chain' men, both in Natchez and New\r\nOrleans, but I do not know whether there were any among them except\r\nthe state convicts.\r\n\r\n\"As the summer was drawing towards a close, and the yellow fever\r\nbeginning to prevail in town, I went to reside some months in the\r\ncountry. This was the cotton picking season, during which, the\r\nplanters say, there is a greater necessity for flogging than at any\r\nother time. And I can assure you, that as I have sat in my window\r\nnight after night, while the cotton was being weighed, I have heard\r\nthe crack of the whip, without much intermission, for a whole hour,\r\nfrom no less than three plantations, some of which were a full mile\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n\"I found that the slaves were kept in the field from daylight until\r\ndark; and then, if they had not gathered what the master or overseer\r\nthought sufficient, they were subjected to the lash.\r\n\r\n\"Many by such treatment are induced to run away and take up their\r\nlodging in the woods. I do not say that all who run away are thus\r\nclosely pressed, but I do know that many are; and I have known no less\r\nthan a dozen desert at a time from the same plantation, in consequence\r\nof the overseer's forcing them to work to the extent of their power,\r\nand then whipping them for not having done more.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose that they run away--what is to become of them in the\r\nforest? If they cannot steal they must perish of hunger--if the nights\r\nare cold, their feet will be frozen; for if they make a fire they may\r\nbe discovered, and be shot at. If they attempt to leave the country,\r\ntheir chance of success is about nothing. They must return, be\r\nwhipped--if old offenders, wear the collar, perhaps be branded, and\r\nfare worse than before.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe it, sir, not six months since, I saw a number of my\r\n_Christian_ neighbors packing up provisions, as I supposed for a deer\r\nhunt; but as I was about offering myself to the party, I learned that\r\ntheir powder and balls were destined to a very different purpose: it\r\nwas, in short, the design of the party to bring home a number of\r\nrunaway slaves, or to shoot them if they should not be able to get\r\npossession of them in any other way.\r\n\r\n\"You will ask, Is not this murder? Call it, sir, by what name you\r\nplease, such are the facts:--many are shot every year, and that too\r\nwhile the masters say they treat their slaves well.\r\n\r\n\"But let me turn your attention to another species of cruelty. About a\r\nyear since I knew a certain slave who had deserted his master, to be\r\ncaught, and for the first time fastened to the stocks. In those same\r\nstocks, from which at midnight I have heard cries of distress, while\r\nthe master slept, and was dreaming, perhaps, of drinking wine and of\r\ndiscussing the price of cotton. On the next morning he was chained in\r\nan immovable posture, and branded in both cheeks with red hot stamps\r\nof iron. Such are the tender mercies of men who love wealth, and are\r\ndetermined to obtain it at any price.\r\n\r\n\"Suffer me to add another to the list of enormities, and I will not\r\noffend you with more.\r\n\r\n\"There was, some time since, brought to trial in this town a planter\r\nresiding about fifteen miles distant, for whipping his slave to death.\r\nYou will suppose, of course, that he was punished. No, sir, he was\r\nacquitted, although there could be no doubt of the fact. I heard the\r\ntale of murder from a man who was acquainted with all the\r\ncircumstances. 'I was,' said he, 'passing along the road near the\r\nburying-ground of the plantation, about nine o'clock at night, when I\r\nsaw several lights gleaming through the woods; and as I approached, in\r\norder to see what was doing, I beheld the coroner of Natchez, with a\r\nnumber of men, standing around the body of a young female, which by\r\nthe torches seemed almost perfectly white. On inquiry I learned that\r\nthe master had so unmercifully beaten this girl that she died under\r\nthe operation: and that also he had so severely punished another of\r\nhis slaves that he was but just alive.'\"\r\n\r\nWe here rest the case for the present, so far as respects the\r\npresentation of facts showing the condition of the slaves, and proceed\r\nto consider the main objections which are usually employed to weaken\r\nsuch testimony, or wholly to set it aside. But before we enter upon\r\nthe examination of specific objections, and introductory to them, we\r\nremark,--\r\n\r\n1. That the system of slavery must be a system of horrible cruelty,\r\nfollows of necessity, from the fact that two millions seven hundred\r\nthousand human beings _are held by force_, and used as articles of\r\nproperty. Nothing but a heavy yoke, and an iron one, could possibly\r\nkeep so many necks in the dust. That must be a constant and mighty\r\npressure which holds so still such a vast army; nothing could do it\r\nbut the daily experience of severities, and the ceaseless dread and\r\ncertainty of the most terrible inflictions if they should dare to toss\r\nin their chains.\r\n\r\n2. Were there nothing else to prove it a system of monstrous cruelty,\r\nthe fact that FEAR is the only motive with which the slave is plied\r\nduring his whole existence, would be sufficient to brand it with\r\nexecration as the grand tormentor of man. The slave's _susceptibility\r\nof pain_ is the sole fulcrum on which slavery works the lever that\r\nmoves him. In this it plants all its stings; here it sinks its hot\r\nirons; cuts its deep gashes; flings its burning embers, and dashes its\r\nboiling brine and liquid fire: into this it strikes its cold flesh\r\nhooks, grappling irons, and instruments of nameless torture; and by it\r\ndrags him shrieking to the end of his pilgrimage. The fact that the\r\nmaster inflicts pain upon the slave not merely as an _end_ to gratify\r\npassion, but constantly as a _means_ of extorting labor, is enough of\r\nitself to show that the system of slavery is unmixed cruelty.\r\n\r\n3. That the slaves must suffer frequent and terrible inflictions,\r\nfollows inevitably from the _character of those who direct their\r\nlabor_. Whatever may be the character of the slaveholders themselves,\r\nall agree that the overseers are, as a class, most abandoned, brutal,\r\nand desperate men. This is so well known and believed that any\r\ntestimony to prove it seems needless. The testimony of Mr. WIRT, late\r\nAttorney General of the United States, a Virginian and a slaveholder,\r\nis as follows. In his life of Patrick Henry, p. 36, speaking of the\r\ndifferent classes of society in Virginia, he says,--\"Last and lowest a\r\nfeculum, of beings called 'overseers'--_the most abject, degraded,\r\nunprincipled race_, always cap in hand to the dons who employ them,\r\nand furnishing materials for the exercise of their _pride, insolence,\r\nand spirit of domination_.\"\r\n\r\nRev. PHINEAS SMITH, of Centreville, New-York, who has resided some\r\nyears at the south, says of overseers--\r\n\r\n\"It need hardly be added that overseers are in general ignorant,\r\n_unprincipled and cruel_, and in such low repute that they are not\r\npermitted to come to the tables of their employers; yet they have the\r\nconstant control of all the human cattle that belong to the master.\r\n\r\n\"These men are continually advancing from their low station to the\r\nhigher one of masters. These changes bring into the possession of\r\npower a class of men of whose mental and moral qualities I have\r\nalready spoken.\"\r\n\r\nRev. HORACE MOULTON, Marlboro', Massachusetts, who lived in Georgia\r\nseveral years, says of them,--\r\n\r\n\"The overseers are _generally loose in their morals_; it is the object\r\nof masters to employ those whom they think will get the most work out\r\nof their hands,--hence those who _whip and torment the slaves the\r\nmost_ are in many instances called the best overseers. The masters\r\nthink those whom the slaves fear the most are the best. Quite a\r\nportion of the masters employ their own slaves as overseers, or rather\r\nthey are called drivers; these are more subject to the will of the\r\nmasters than the white overseers are; some of them are as lordly as an\r\nAustrian prince, and sometimes more cruel even than the whites.\"\r\n\r\nThat the overseers are, as a body, sensual, brutal, and violent men is\r\n_proverbial_. The tender mercies of such men _must be cruel_.\r\n\r\n4. The _ownership_ of human beings necessarily presupposes an utter\r\ndisregard of their happiness. He who assumes it monopolizes their\r\n_whole capital_, leaves them no stock on which to trade, and out of\r\nwhich to _make_ happiness. Whatever is the master's gain is the\r\nslave's loss, a loss wrested from him by the master, for the express\r\npurpose of making it _his own gain_; this is the master's constant\r\nemployment--forcing the slave to toil--violently wringing from him\r\nall he has and all he gets, and using it as his own;--like the vile\r\nbird that never builds its nest from materials of its own gathering,\r\nbut either drives other birds from theirs and takes possession of\r\nthem, or tears them in pieces to get the means of constructing their\r\nown. This daily practice of forcibly robbing others, and habitually\r\nliving on the plunder, cannot but beget in the mind the _habit_ of\r\nregarding the interests and happiness of those whom it robs, as of no\r\nsort of consequence in comparison with its own; consequently whenever\r\nthose interests and this happiness are in the way of its own\r\ngratification, they will be sacrificed without scruple. He who cannot\r\nsee this would be unable to _feel_ it, if it were seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjection I--\"SUCH CRUELTIES ARE INCREDIBLE.\"\r\n\r\nThe enormities inflicted by slaveholders upon their slaves will never\r\nbe discredited except by those who overlook the simple fact, that he\r\nwho holds human beings as his bona fide property, _regards_ them as\r\nproperty, and not as _persons;_ this is his permanent state of mind\r\ntoward them. He does not contemplate slaves as human beings,\r\nconsequently does not _treat_ them as such; and with entire\r\nindifference sees them suffer privations and writhe under blows,\r\nwhich, if inflicted upon whites, would fill him with horror and\r\nindignation. He regards that as good treatment of slaves, which would\r\nseem to him insufferable abuse if practiced upon others; and would\r\ndenounce that as a monstrous outrage and horrible cruelty, if\r\nperpretated upon white men and women, which he sees every day meted\r\nout to black slaves, without perhaps ever thinking it cruel.\r\nAccustomed all his life to regard them rather as domestic animals, to\r\nhear them stormed at, and to see them cuffed and caned; and being\r\nhimself in the constant habit of treating them thus, such practices\r\nhave become to him a mere matter of course, and make no impression on\r\nhis mind. True, it is incredible that men should treat as _chattels_\r\nthose whom they truly regard as _human beings;_ but that they should\r\ntreat as chattels and working animals those whom they _regard_ as\r\nsuch, is no marvel. The common treatment of dogs, when they are in the\r\nway, is to kick them out of it; we see them every day kicked off the\r\nsidewalks, and out of shops, and on Sabbaths out of churches,--yet, as\r\nthey are but _dogs_, these do not strike us as outrages; yet, if we\r\nwere to see men, women, and children--our neighbors and friends,\r\nkicked out of stores by merchants, or out of churches by the deacons\r\nand sexton, we should call the perpetrators inhuman wretches.\r\n\r\nWe have said that slaveholders regard their slaves not as human\r\nbeings, but as mere working animals, or merchandise. The whole\r\nvocabulary of slaveholders, their laws, their usages, and their entire\r\ntreatment of their slaves fully establish this. The same terms are\r\napplied to slaves that are given to cattle. They are called \"stock.\"\r\nSo when the children of slaves are spoken of prospectively, they are\r\ncalled their \"increase;\" the same term that is applied to flocks and\r\nherds. So the female slaves that are mothers, are called \"breeders\"\r\ntill past child bearing; and often the same terms are applied to the\r\ndifferent sexes that are applied to the males and females among\r\ncattle. Those who compel the labor of slaves and cattle have the same\r\nappellation, \"drivers:\" the names which they call them are the same\r\nand similar to those given to their horses and oxen. The laws of slave\r\nstates make them property, equally with goats and swine; they are\r\nlevied upon for debt in the same way; they are included in the same\r\nadvertisements of public sales with cattle, swine, and asses; when\r\nmoved from one part of the country to another, they are herded in\r\ndroves like cattle, and like them urged on by drivers; their labor is\r\ncompelled in the same way. They are bought and sold, and separated\r\nlike cattle: when exposed for sale, their good qualities are described\r\nas jockies show off the good points of their horses; their strength,\r\nactivity, skill, power of endurance, &c. are lauded,--and those who\r\nbid upon them examine their persons, just as purchasers inspect horses\r\nand oxen; they open their mouths to see if their teeth are sound;\r\nstrip their backs to see if they are badly scarred, and handle their\r\nlimbs and muscles to see if they are firmly knit. Like horses, they\r\nare warranted to be \"sound,\" or to be returned to the owner if\r\n\"unsound.\" A father gives his son a horse and a _slave_; by his will\r\nhe distributes among them his race-horses, hounds, game-cocks, and\r\n_slaves_. We leave the reader to carry out the parallel which we have\r\nonly begun. Its details would cover many pages.\r\n\r\nThat slaveholders do not practically regard slaves as _human beings_\r\nis abundantly shown by their own voluntary testimony. In a recent work\r\nentitled, \"The South vindicated from the Treason and Fanaticism of\r\nNorthern Abolitionists,\" which was written, we are informed, by\r\nColonel Dayton, late member of Congress from South Carolina; the\r\nwriter, speaking of the awe with which the slaves regard the whites,\r\nsays,--\r\n\r\n\"The northerner looks upon a band of negroes as upon so many _men_,\r\nbut the planter or southerner _views them in a very different light._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from the speech of Mr. SUMMERS, of Virginia, in the\r\nlegislature of that state, Jan. 26, 1832. See the Richmond Whig.\r\n\r\n\"When, in the sublime lessons of Christianity, he (the slaveholder) is\r\ntaught to 'do unto others as he would have others do unto him,' HE\r\nNEVER DREAMS THAT THE DEGRADED NEGRO IS WITHIN THE PALE OF THAT HOLY\r\nCANON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT JEFFERSON, in his letter to GOVERNOR COLES, of Illinois,\r\ndated Aug. 25, 1814, asserts, that slaveholders regard their slaves as\r\nbrutes, in the following remarkable language.\r\n\r\n\"Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded\r\ncondition, both bodily and mental, of these unfortunate beings [the\r\nslaves], FEW MINDS HAVE YET DOUBTED BUT THAT THEY WERE AS LEGITIMATE\r\nSUBJECTS OF PROPERTY AS THEIR HORSES OR CATTLE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving shown that slaveholders regard their slaves as mere working\r\nanimals and cattle, we now proceed to show that their actual treatment\r\nof them, is _worse_ than it would be if they were brutes. We repeat\r\nit, SLAVEHOLDERS TREAT THEIR SLAVES WORSE THAN THEY DO THEIR BRUTES.\r\nWhoever heard of cows or sheep being deliberately tied up and beaten\r\nand lacerated till they died? or horses coolly tortured by the hour,\r\ntill covered with mangled flesh, or of swine having their legs tied\r\nand being suspended from a tree and lacerated with thongs for hours,\r\nor of hounds stretched and made fast at full length, flayed with\r\nwhips, red pepper rubbed into their bleeding gashes, and hot brine\r\ndashed on to aggravate the torture? Yet just such forms and degrees of\r\ntorture are _daily_ perpetrated upon the slaves. Now no man that knows\r\nhuman nature will marvel at this. Though great cruelties have always\r\nbeen inflicted by men upon brutes, yet incomparably the most horrid\r\never perpetrated, have been those of men upon _their own species_. Any\r\nleaf of history turned over at random has proof enough of this. Every\r\nreflecting mind perceives that when men hold _human beings_ as\r\n_property_, they must, from the nature of the case, treat them worse\r\nthan they treat their horses and oxen. It is impossible for _cattle_\r\nto excite in men such tempests of fury as men excite in each other.\r\nMen are often provoked if their horses or hounds refuse to do, or\r\ntheir pigs refuse to go where they wish to drive them, but the feeling\r\nis rarely intense and never permanent. It is vexation and impatience,\r\nrather than settled rage, malignity, or revenge. If horses and dogs\r\nwere intelligent beings, and still held as property, their opposition\r\nto the wishes of their owners, would exasperate them immeasurably more\r\nthan it would be possible for them to do, with the minds of brutes.\r\nNone but little children and idiots get angry at sticks and stones\r\nthat lie in their way or hurt them; but put into sticks and stones\r\nintelligence, and will, and power of feeling and motion, while they\r\nremain as now, articles of property, and what a towering rage would\r\nmen be in, if bushes whipped them in the face when they walked among\r\nthem, or stones rolled over their toes when they climbed hills! and\r\nwhat exemplary vengeance would be inflicted upon door-steps and\r\nhearth-stones, if they were to move out of their places, instead of\r\nlying still where they were put for their owners to tread upon. The\r\ngreatest provocation to human nature is _opposition to its will_. If a\r\nman's will be resisted by one far _below_ him, the provocation is\r\nvastly greater, than when it is resisted by an acknowledged superior.\r\nIn the former case, it inflames strong passions, which in the latter\r\nlie dormant. The rage of proud Haman knew no bounds against the poor\r\nJew who would not do as he wished, and so he built a gallows for him.\r\nIf the person opposing the will of another, be so far below him as to\r\nbe on a level with chattels, and be actually held and used as an\r\narticle of property; pride, scorn, lust of power, rage and revenge\r\nexplode together upon the hapless victim. The idea of _property_\r\nhaving a will, and that too in opposition to the will of its _owner_,\r\nand counteracting it, is a stimulant of terrible power to the most\r\nrelentless human passions and from the nature of slavery, and the\r\nconstitution of the human mind, this fierce stimulant must, with\r\nvarious degrees of strength, act upon slaveholders almost without\r\nceasing. The slave, however abject and crushed, is an intelligent\r\nbeing: he has a _will_, and that will cannot be annihilated, _it will\r\nshow itself_; if for a moment it is smothered, like pent up fires when\r\nvent is found, it flames the fiercer. Make intelligence _property_,\r\nand its manager will have his match; he is met at every turn by an\r\n_opposing will_, not in the form of down-right rebellion and defiance,\r\nbut yet, visibly, an _ever-opposing will_. He sees it in the\r\ndissatisfied look, and reluctant air and unwilling movement; the\r\nconstrained strokes of labor, the drawling tones, the slow hearing,\r\nthe feigned stupidity, the sham pains and sickness, the short memory;\r\nand he _feels_ it every hour, in innumerable forms, frustrating his\r\ndesigns by a ceaseless though perhaps invisible countermining. This\r\nunceasing opposition to the will of its 'owner,' on the part of his\r\nrational 'property,' is to the slaveholder as the hot iron to the\r\nnerve. He raves under it, and storms, and gnashes, and smites; but the\r\nmore he smites, the hotter it gets, and the more it burns him.\r\nFurther, this opposition of the slave's will to his owner's, not only\r\nexcites him to severity, that he may gratify his rage, but makes it\r\nnecessary for him to use violence in breaking down this\r\nresistance--thus subjecting the slave to additional tortures. There is\r\nanother inducement to cruel inflictions upon the slave, and a\r\nnecessity for it, which does not exist in the case of brutes.\r\nOffenders must be made an example to others, to strike them with\r\nterror. If a slave runs away and is caught, his master flogs him with\r\nterrible severity, not merely to gratify his resentment, and to keep\r\nhim from running away again, but as a warning to others. So in every\r\ncase of disobedience, neglect, stubbornness, unfaithfulness,\r\nindolence, insolence, theft, feigned sickness, when his directions are\r\nforgotten, or slighted, or supposed to be, or his wishes crossed, or\r\nhis property injured, or left exposed, or his work ill-executed, the\r\nmaster is tempted to inflict cruelties, not merely to wreak his own\r\nvengeance upon him, and to make the slave more circumspect in future,\r\nbut to sustain his authority over the other slaves, to restrain them\r\nfrom like practices, and to preserve his own property.\r\n\r\nA multitude of facts, illustrating the position that slaveholders\r\ntreat their slaves _worse_ than they do their cattle, will occur to\r\nall who are familiar with slavery. When cattle break through their\r\nowners' inclosures and escape, if found, they are driven back and\r\nfastened in again; and even slaveholders would execrate as a wretch,\r\nthe man who should tie them up, and bruise and lacerate them for\r\nstraying away; but when _slaves_ that have escaped are caught, they\r\nare flogged with the most terrible severity. When herds of cattle are\r\ndriven to market, they are suffered to go in the easiest way, each by\r\nhimself; but when slaves are driven to market, they are fastened\r\ntogether with handcuffs, galled by iron collars and chains, and thus\r\nforced to travel on foot hundreds of miles, sleeping at night in their\r\nchains. Sheep, and sometimes horned cattle are marked with their\r\nowners' initials--but this is generally done with paint, and of course\r\nproduces no pain. Slaves, too, are often marked with their owners'\r\ninitials, but the letters are stamped into their flesh with a hot\r\niron. Cattle are suffered to graze their pastures without stint; but\r\nthe slaves are restrained in their food to a fixed allowance. The\r\nslaveholders' horses are notoriously far better fed, more moderately\r\nworked, have fewer hours of labor, and longer intervals of rest than\r\ntheir slaves; and their valuable horses are far more comfortably\r\nhoused and lodged, and their stables more effectually defended from\r\nthe weather, than the slaves' huts. We have here merely _begun_ a\r\ncomparison, which the reader can easily carry out at length, from the\r\nmaterials furnished in this work.\r\n\r\nWe will, however, subjoin a few testimonies of slaveholders, and\r\nothers who have resided in slave states, expressly asserting that\r\nslaves are treated _worse than brutes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. GEORGE BUCHANAN, of Baltimore, Maryland, a member of the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society, in an oration delivered in Baltimore,\r\nJuly 4, 1791, page 10, says:\r\n\r\n\"The Africans whom you despise, whom you _more inhumanly treat than\r\nbrutes_, are equally capable of improvement with yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. GEORGE WHITEFIELD, in his celebrated letter to the\r\nslaveholders of Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia, written one hundred years ago, (See Benezet's Caution to\r\nGreat Britain and her Colonies, page 13), says:\r\n\r\n\"Sure I am, it is sinful to use them as bad, nay worse than if they\r\nwere brutes; and whatever particular _exceptions_ there may be, (as I\r\nwould charitably hope there are _some_) I fear the _generality_ of you\r\nthat own negroes, _are liable to such a charge_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. RICE, of Kentucky in his speech in the Convention that formed the\r\nConstitution of that state, in 1790, says:\r\n\r\n\"He [the slave] is a rational creature, reduced by the power of\r\nlegislation to the _state of a brute_, and thereby deprived of every\r\nprivilege of humanity.... The brute may steal or rob, to supply\r\nhis hunger; but the slave, though in the most starving condition,\r\n_dare not do either, on penalty of death, or some severe punishment_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. HORACE MOULTON, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in\r\nMarlborough, Mass. who lived some years in Georgia, says:\r\n\r\n\"The southern horses and dogs have enough to eat, and good care is\r\ntaken of them; but southern negroes--who can describe their misery and\r\ntheir wretchedness, their nakedness and their cruel scourgings!  None\r\nbut God. Should we _whip our horses_ as they whip their slaves, even\r\nfor small offences, we should expose ourselves to the penalty of the\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. PHINEAS SMITH, Centerville, Allegany county, New York, who has\r\nresided four years in the midst of southern slavery--\r\n\r\n\"Avarice and cruelty are twin sisters; and I do not hesitate to\r\ndeclare before the world, as my deliberate opinion, that there is\r\n_less compassion_ for working slaves at the south, than for working\r\noxen at the north.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEVEN SEWALL, Esq. Winthrop, Maine, a member of the Congregational\r\nChurch, and late agent of the Winthrop Manufacturing Company, who\r\nresided five years in Alabama, says--\r\n\r\n\"I do not think that brutes, not even horses, are treated with _so\r\nmuch cruelty_ as American slaves.\"\r\n\r\nIf the preceding considerations are insufficient to remove incredulity\r\nrespecting the cruelties suffered by slaves, and if northern objectors\r\nstill say, 'We might believe such things of savages, but that\r\ncivilized men, and republicans, in this Christian country, can openly\r\nand by system perpetrate such enormities, is impossible';--to such we\r\nreply, that this incredulity of the people of the free states, is not\r\nonly discreditable to their intelligence, but to their consistency.\r\n\r\nWho is so ignorant as not to know, or so incredulous as to disbelieve,\r\nthat the early Baptists of New England were fined, imprisoned,\r\nscourged, and finally banished by our puritan forefathers?--and that\r\nthe Quakers were confined in dungeons, publicly whipped at the\r\ncart-tail, had their ears cut off, cleft sticks put upon their\r\ntongues, and that five of them, four men and one woman, were hung on\r\nBoston Common, for propagating the sentiments of the Society of\r\nFriends? Who discredits the fact, that the civil authorities in\r\nMassachusetts, less than a hundred and fifty years ago, confined in\r\nthe public jail a little girl of four years old, and publicly hung the\r\nRev. Mr. Burroughs, and eighteen other persons, mostly women, and\r\nkilled another, (Giles Corey,) by extending him upon his back, and\r\npiling weights upon his breast till he was crushed to death [17]--and\r\nthis for no other reason than that these men and women, and this\r\nlittle child, were accused by others of _bewitching_ them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17:  Judge Sewall, of Mass. in his diary, describing this\r\nhorrible scene, says that when the tongue of the poor sufferer had, in\r\nthe extremity of his dying agony, protruded from his mouth, a person\r\nin attendance took his cane and thrust it back into his mouth.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the children in Connecticut, know that the following was once a\r\nlaw of that state:\r\n\r\n\"No food or lodging shall be allowed to a Quaker. If any person turns\r\nQuaker, he shall be banished, and not be suffered to return on pain of\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nThese objectors can readily believe the fact, that in the city of New\r\nYork, less than a hundred years since, thirteen persons were publicly\r\nburned to death, over a slow fire: and that the legislature of the\r\nsame State took under its paternal care the African slave-trade, and\r\ndeclared that \"all encouragement should be given to the _direct_\r\nimportation of slaves; that all _smuggling_ of slaves should be\r\ncondemned, as _an eminent discouragement to the fair trader_.\"\r\n\r\nThey do not call in question the fact that the African slave-trade was\r\ncarried on from the ports of the free states till within thirty years;\r\nthat even members of the Society of Friends were actively engaged in\r\nit, shortly before the revolutionary war; [18] that as late as 1807,\r\nno less than fifty-nine of the vessels engaged in that trade, were\r\nsent out from the little state of Rhode Island, which had then only\r\nabout seventy thousand inhabitants; that among those most largely\r\nengaged in these foul crimes, are the men whom the people of Rhode\r\nIsland delight to honor: that the man who dipped most deeply in that\r\ntrade of blood (James De Wolf,) and amassed a most princely fortune by\r\nit, was not long since their senator in Congress; and another, who was\r\ncaptain of one of his vessels, was recently Lieutenant Governor of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: See Life and Travels of John Woolman, page 92.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey can believe, too, all the horrors of the middle passage, the\r\nchains, suffocation, maimings, stranglings, starvation, drownings, and\r\ncold blooded murders, atrocities perpetrated on board these\r\nslave-ships by their own citizens, perhaps by their own townsmen and\r\nneighbors--possibly by their own _fathers_: but oh! they 'can't\r\nbelieve that the slaveholders can be so hard-hearted towards their\r\nslaves as to treat them with great cruelty.' They can believe that his\r\nHoliness the Pope, with his cardinals, bishops and priests, have\r\ntortured, broken on the wheel, and burned to death thousands of\r\nProtestants--that eighty thousand of the Anabaptists were slaughtered\r\nin Germany--that hundreds of thousands of the blameless Waldenses,\r\nHuguenots and Lollards, were torn in pieces by the most titled\r\ndignitaries of church and state, and that _almost every professedly\r\nChristian sect, has, at some period of its history, persecuted unto\r\nblood_ those who dissented from their creed. They can believe, also,\r\nthat in Boston, New York, Utica, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Alton, and\r\nin scores of other cities and villages of the free states, 'gentlemen\r\nof property and standing,' led on by civil officers, by members of\r\nstate legislatures, and of Congress, by judges and attorneys-general,\r\nby editors of newspapers, and by professed ministers of the gospel,\r\nhave organized mobs, broken up lawful meetings of peaceable citizens,\r\ncommitted assault and battery upon their persons, knocked them down\r\nwith stones, led them about with ropes, dragged them from their beds\r\nat midnight, gagged and forced them into vehicles, and driven them\r\ninto unfrequented places, and there tormented and disfigured\r\nthem--that they have rifled their houses, made bonfires of their\r\nfurniture in the streets, burned to the ground, or torn in pieces the\r\nhalls or churches in which they were assembled--attacked them with\r\ndeadly weapons, stabbed some, shot others, and killed one. They can\r\nbelieve all this--and further, that a majority of the citizens in the\r\nplaces where these outrages have been committed, connived at them; and\r\nby refusing to indict the perpetrators, or, if they were indicted, by\r\ncombining to secure their acquittal, and rejoicing in it, have\r\npublicly adopted these felonies as their own. All these things they\r\ncan believe without hesitation, and that they have even been done by\r\ntheir own acquaintances, neighbors, relatives; perhaps those with whom\r\nthey interchange courtesies, those for whom they _vote_, or to whose\r\n_salaries they contribute_--but yet, oh! they can never believe that\r\nslaveholders inflict cruelties upon their slaves!\r\n\r\nThey can give full credence to the kidnapping, imprisonment, and\r\ndeliberate murder of WILLIAM MORGAN, and that by men of high standing\r\nin society; they can believe that this deed was aided and abetted, and\r\nthe murderers screened from justice, by a large number of influential\r\npersons, who were virtually accomplices, either before or after the\r\nfact; and that this combination was so effectual, as successfully to\r\ndefy and triumph over the combined powers of the government;--yet\r\nthat those who constantly rob men of their time, liberty, and wages,\r\nand all their _rights_, should rob them of bits of flesh, and\r\noccasionally of a tooth, make their backs bleed, and put fetters on\r\ntheir legs, is too monstrous to be credited! Further these same\r\npersons, who 'can't believe' that slaveholders are so iron-hearted as\r\nto ill-treat their slaves, believe that the very _elite_ of these\r\nslaveholders, those most highly esteemed and honored among them, are\r\ncontinually daring each other to mortal conflict, and in the presence\r\nof mutual friends, taking deadly aim at each other's hearts, with\r\nsettled purpose to _kill_, if possible. That among the most\r\ndistinguished governors of slave states, among their most celebrated\r\njudges, senators, and representatives in Congress, there is hardly\r\n_one_, who has not either killed, or tried to kill, or aided and\r\nabetted his friends in trying to kill, one or more individuals. That\r\npistols, dirks, bowie knives, or other instruments of death are\r\ngenerally carried throughout the slave states--and that deadly affrays\r\nwith them, in the streets of their cities and villages, are matters of\r\ndaily occurrence; that the sons of slaveholders in southern colleges,\r\nbully, threaten, and fire upon their teachers, and their teachers upon\r\nthem; that during the last summer, in the most celebrated seat of\r\nscience and literature in the south, the University of Virginia, the\r\nprofessors were attacked by more than seventy armed students, and, in\r\nthe words of a Virginia paper, were obliged 'to conceal themselves\r\nfrom their fury;' also that almost all the riots and violence that\r\noccur in northern colleges, are produced by the turbulence and lawless\r\npassions of southern students. That such are the furious passions of\r\nslaveholders, no considerations of personal respect, none for the\r\nproprieties of life, none for the honor of our national legislature,\r\nnone for the character of our country abroad, can restrain the\r\nslaveholding members of Congress from the most disgraceful personal\r\nencounters on the floor of our nation's legislature--smiting their\r\nfists in each other's faces, throttling and even _kicking_ and trying\r\nto _gouge_ each other--that during the session of the Congress just\r\nclosed, no less than six slaveholders, taking fire at words spoken in\r\ndebate, have either rushed at each other's throats, or kicked, or\r\nstruck, or attempted to knock each other down; and that in all these\r\ninstances, they would doubtless have killed each other, if their\r\nfriends had not separated them. Further, they know full well, these\r\nwere not insignificant, vulgar blackguards, elected because they were\r\nthe head bullies and bottle-holders in a boxing ring, or because their\r\nconstituents went drunk to the ballot box; but they were some of the\r\nmost conspicuous members of the House--one of them a former speaker.\r\n\r\nOur newspapers are full of these and similar daily occurrences among\r\nslaveholders, copied verbatim from their own accounts of them in their\r\nown papers and all this we fully credit; no man is simpleton enough to\r\ncry out 'Oh, I can't believe that slaveholders do such things;'--and\r\nyet when we turn to the treatment which these men mete out to their\r\n_slaves_, and show that they are in the habitual practice of striking,\r\nkicking, knocking down and shooting _them_ as well as each other--the\r\nlook of blank incredulity that comes over northern dough-faces, is a\r\nstudy for a painter: and then the sentimental outcry, with eyes and\r\nhands uplifted, 'Oh, indeed, I can't believe the slaveholders are so\r\ncruel to their slaves.' Most amiable and touching charity! Truly, of\r\nall Yankee notions and free state products, there is nothing like a\r\n'_dough face_'--the great northern staple for the southern\r\nmarket--'made to order,' in any quantity, and _always on hand_. 'Dough\r\nfaces!' Thanks to a slaveholder's contempt for the name, with its\r\nimmortality of truth, infamy and scorn.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: \"_Doe_ face,\" which owes its paternity to John Randolph,\r\nage has mellowed into \"_dough_ face\"--a cognomen quite as expressive\r\nand appropriate, if not as classical.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the people of the free states affect to disbelieve the\r\ncruelties perpetrated upon the slaves, yet slaveholders believe _each\r\nother_ guilty of them, and speak of them with the utmost freedom. If\r\nslaveholders disbelieve any statement of cruelty inflicted upon a\r\nslave, it is not on account of its _enormity_. The traveler at the\r\nsouth will hear in Delaware, and in all parts of Maryland and\r\nVirginia, from the lips of slaveholders, statements of the most\r\nhorrible cruelties suffered by the slaves _farther_ south, in the\r\nCarolinas and Georgia; when he finds himself in those states he will\r\nhear similar accounts about the treatment of the slaves in _Florida_\r\nand _Louisiana_; and in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee he will hear\r\nof the tragedies enacted on the plantations in Arkansas, Alabama and\r\nMississippi. Since Anti-Slavery Societies have been in operation, and\r\nslaveholders have found themselves on trial before the world, and put\r\nupon their good behavior, northern slaveholders have grown cautious,\r\nand now often substitute denials and set defences, for the voluntary\r\ntestimony about cruelty in the far south, which, before that period,\r\nwas given with entire freedom. Still, however, occasionally the 'truth\r\nwill out,' as the reader will see by the following testimony of an\r\nEast Tennessee newspaper, in which, speaking of the droves of slaves\r\ntaken from the upper country to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, etc.,\r\nthe editor says, they are 'traveling to a region where their condition\r\nthrough time WILL BE SECOND ONLY TO THAT OF THE WRETCHED CREATURES IN\r\nHELL.' See \"Maryville Intelligencer,\" of Oct, 4, 1835. Distant\r\ncruelties and cruelties _long past_, have been till recently, favorite\r\ntopics with slaveholders. They have not only been ready to acknowledge\r\nthat their _fathers_ have exercised great cruelty toward their slaves,\r\nbut have voluntarily, in their official acts, made proclamation of it\r\nand entered it on their public records. The Legislature of North\r\nCarolina, in 1798, branded the successive legislatures of that state\r\nfor more than thirty years previous, with the infamy of treatment\r\ntowards their slaves, which they pronounce to be 'disgraceful to\r\nhumanity, and degrading in the highest degree to the laws and\r\nprinciples of a free, Christian, and enlightened country.' This\r\ntreatment was the enactment and perpetuation of a most barbarous and\r\ncruel law.\r\n\r\nBut enough. As the objector can and does believe all the preceeding\r\nfacts, if he still '_can't_ believe' as to the cruelties of\r\nslaveholders, it would be barbarous to tantalize his incapacity either\r\nwith evidence or argument. Let him have the benefit of the act in such\r\ncase made and provided.\r\n\r\nHaving shown that the incredulity of the objector respecting the\r\ncruelty inflicted upon the slaves, is discreditable to his\r\nconsistency, we now proceed to show that it is equally so to his\r\n_intelligence_.\r\n\r\nWhoever disbelieves the foregoing statements of cruelties, on the\r\nground of their enormity, proclaims his own ignorance of the nature\r\nand history of man. What! incredulous about the atrocities perpetrated\r\nby those who hold human beings as property, to be used for their\r\npleasure, when history herself has done little else in recording human\r\ndeeds, than to dip her blank chart in the blood shed by arbitrary\r\npower, and unfold to human gaze the great red scroll? That cruelty is\r\nthe natural effect of arbitrary power, has been the result of all\r\nexperience, and the voice of universal testimony since the world\r\nbegan. Shall human nature's axioms, six thousand years old, go for\r\nnothing? Are the combined product of human experience, and the\r\nconcurrent records of human character, to be set down as 'old wives'\r\nfables?' To disbelieve that arbitrary power naturally and habitually\r\nperpetrates cruelties, where it can do it with impunity, is not only\r\nignorance of man, but of _things_. It is to be blind to innumerable\r\nproofs which are before every man's eyes; proofs that are stereotyped\r\nin the very words and phrases that are on every one's lips. Take for\r\nexample the words _despot_ and _despotic_. Despot, signifies\r\netymologically, merely one who _possesses_ arbitrary power, and at\r\nfirst, it was used to designate those alone who _possessed_ unlimited\r\npower over human beings, entirely irrespective of the way in which\r\nthey exercised it, whether mercifully or cruelly. But the fact, that\r\nthose who possessed such power, made their subjects their _victims_,\r\nhas wrought a total change in the popular meaning of the word. It now\r\nsignifies, in common parlance, not one who _possesses_ unlimited power\r\nover others, but one who exercises the power that he has, whether\r\nlittle or much, _cruelly_. So _despotic_, instead of meaning what it\r\nonce did, something pertaining to the _possession_ of unlimited power,\r\nsignifies something pertaining to the _capricious, unmerciful and\r\nrelentless exercise_ of such power.\r\n\r\nThe word tyrant, is another example--formerly it implied merely a\r\n_possession_ of arbitrary power, but from the invariable abuse of such\r\npower by its possessors, the proper and entire meaning of the word is\r\nlost, and it now signifies merely one who _exercises power to the\r\ninjury of others_. The words tyrannical and tyranny follow the same\r\nanalogy. So the word arbitrary; which formerly implied that which\r\npertains to the will of one, independently of others; but from the\r\nfact that those who had no restraint upon their wills, were invariably\r\ncapricious, unreasonable and oppressive, these words convey accurately\r\nthe present sense of _arbitrary_, when applied to a person.\r\n\r\nHow can the objector persist in disbelieving that cruelty is the\r\nnatural effect of arbitrary power, when the very words of every day,\r\nrise up on his lips in testimony against him--words which once\r\nsignified the _mere possession_ of arbitrary power, but have lost\r\ntheir meaning, and now signify merely its cruel _exercise_; because\r\nsuch a use of it has been proved by the experience of the world, to be\r\ninseparable from its _possession_--words now frigid with horror, and\r\nnever used even by the objector without feeling a cold chill run over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nArbitrary power is to the mind what alcohol is to the body; it\r\nintoxicates. Man loves power. It is perhaps the strongest human\r\npassion; and the more absolute the power, the stronger the desire for\r\nit; and the more it is desired, the more its exercise is enjoyed: this\r\nenjoyment is to human nature a fearful temptation,--generally an\r\novermatch for it. Hence it is true, with hardly an exception, that\r\narbitrary power is abused in proportion as it is _desired_. The fact\r\nthat a person intensely desires power over others, _without\r\nrestraint_, shows the absolute necessity of restraint. What woman\r\nwould marry a man who made it a condition that he should have the\r\npower to divorce her whenever he pleased? Oh! he might never wish to\r\nexercise it, but the _power_ he would have! No woman, not stark mad,\r\nwould trust her happiness in such hands.\r\n\r\nWould a father apprentice his son to a master, who insisted that his\r\npower over the lad should be _absolute_? The master might perhaps,\r\nnever wish to commit a battery upon the boy, but if he should, he\r\ninsists upon having full swing! He who would leave his son in the,\r\nclutches of such a wretch, would be bled and blistered for a lunatic\r\nas soon as his friends could get their hands upon him.\r\n\r\nThe possession of power, even when greatly restrained, is such a fiery\r\nstimulant, that its lodgement in human hands is always perilous. Give\r\nmen the handling of immense sums of money, and all the eyes of Argus\r\nand the hands of Briarcus can hardly prevent embezzlement.\r\n\r\nThe mutual and ceaseless accusations of the two great political\r\nparties in this country, show the universal belief that this tendency\r\nof human nature to abuse power, is so strong, that even the most\r\npowerful legal restraints are insufficient for its safe custody. From\r\ncongress and state legislatures down to grog-shop caucuses and street\r\nwranglings, each party keeps up an incessant din about _abuses of\r\npower_. Hardly an officer, either of the general or state governments,\r\nfrom the President down to the ten thousand postmasters, and from\r\ngovernors to the fifty thousand constables, escapes the charge of\r\n'_abuse of power_.' 'Oppression,' 'Extortion,' 'Venality,' 'Bribery,'\r\n'Corruption,' 'Perjury,' 'Misrule,' 'Spoils,' 'Defalcation,' stand on\r\nevery newspaper. Now without any estimate of the lies told in these\r\nmutual charges, there is truth enough to make each party ready to\r\nbelieve of the other, and _of their best men too,_ any abuse of power,\r\nhowever monstrous. As is the State, so is the Church. From General\r\nConferences to circuit preachers; and from General Assemblies to\r\nchurch sessions, abuses of power spring up as weeds from the dunghill.\r\n\r\nAll legal restraints are framed upon the presumption, that men will\r\nabuse their power if not hemmed in by them. This lies at the bottom of\r\nall those checks and balances contrived for keeping governments upon\r\ntheir centres. If there is among human convictions one that is\r\ninvariable and universal, it is, that when men possess unrestrained\r\npower over others, over their time, choice, conscience, persons,\r\nvotes, or means of subsistence, they are under great temptations to\r\nabuse it; and that the intensity with which such power is desired,\r\ngenerally measures the certainty and the degree of its abuse.\r\n\r\nThat American slaveholders possess a power over their slaves which is\r\nvirtually absolute, none will deny.[20] That they _desire_ this\r\nabsolute power, is shown from the fact of their holding and exercising\r\nit, and making laws to confirm and enlarge it. That the desire to\r\npossess this power, every tittle of it, is _intense_, is proved by the\r\nfact, that slaveholders cling to it with such obstinate tenacity, as\r\nwell as by all their doings and sayings, their threats, cursings and\r\ngnashings against all who denounce the exercise of such power as\r\nusurpation and outrage, and counsel its immediate abrogation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The following extracts from the laws of slave-states are\r\nproofs sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"The slave is ENTIRELY subject to the WILL of his master.\"--Louisiana\r\nCivil Code, Art. 273.\r\n\r\n\"Slaves shall be deemed, sold, taken, reputed and adjudged in law to\r\nbe _chattels personal,_ in the hands of their owner and possessors,\r\nand their executors, administrators and assigns, TO ALL INTENTS,\r\nCONSTRUCTIONS, AND PURPOSES, WHATSOEVER.\"--Laws of South Carolina, 2\r\nBrev. Dig. 229; Prince's Digest, 446, &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the case--from the laws of mind, such power, so\r\nintensely desired, griped with such a death-clutch, and with such\r\nfierce spurnings of all curtailment or restraint, _cannot but be\r\nabused._ Privations and inflictions must be its natural, habitual\r\nproducts, with ever and anon, terror, torture, and despair let loose\r\nto do their worst upon the helpless victims.\r\n\r\nThough power over others is in every case liable to be used to their\r\ninjury, yet, in almost all cases, the subject individual is shielded\r\nfrom great outrages by strong safeguards. If he have talents, or\r\nlearning, or wealth, or office, or personal respectability, or\r\ninfluential friends, these, with the protection of law and the rights\r\nof citizenship, stand round him as a body guard: and even if he lacked\r\nall these, yet, had he the same color, features, form, dialect,\r\nhabits, and associations with the privileged caste of society, he\r\nwould find in _them_ a shield from many injuries, which would be\r\n_invited,_ if in these respects he differed widely from the rest of\r\nthe community, and was on that account regarded with disgust and\r\naversion. This is the condition of the slave; not only is he deprived\r\nof the artificial safeguards of the law, but has none of those\r\n_natural_ safeguards enumerated above, which are a protection to\r\nothers. But not only is the slave destitute of those peculiarities,\r\nhabits, tastes, and acquisitions, which by assimilating the possessor\r\nto the rest of the community, excite their interest in him, and thus,\r\nin a measure, secure for him their protection; but he possesses those\r\npeculiarities of bodily organization which are looked upon with deep\r\ndisgust, contempt, prejudice, and aversion. Besides this, constant\r\ncontact with the ignorance and stupidity of the slaves, their filth,\r\nrags, and nakedness; their cowering air, servile employments,\r\nrepulsive food, and squalid hovels, their purchase and sale, and use\r\nas brutes--all these associations, constantly mingling and circulating\r\nin the minds of slaveholders, and inveterated by the hourly\r\nirritations which must assail all who use human beings as things,\r\nproduce in them a permanent state of feeling toward the slave, made up\r\nof repulsion and settled ill-will. When we add to this the corrosions\r\nproduced by the petty thefts of slaves, the necessity of constant\r\nwatching, their reluctant service, and indifference to their master's\r\ninterests, their ill concealed aversion to him, and spurning of his\r\nauthority; and finally, that fact, as old as human nature, that men\r\nalways hate those whom they oppress, and oppress those whom they hate,\r\nthus oppression and hatred mutually begetting and perpetuating each\r\nother--and we have a raging compound of fiery elements and disturbing\r\nforces, so stimulating and inflaming the mind of the slaveholder\r\nagainst the slave, that _it cannot but break forth upon him with\r\ndesolating fury._\r\n\r\nTo deny that cruelty is the spontaneous and uniform product of\r\narbitrary power, and that the natural and controlling tendency of such\r\npower is to make its possessor cruel, oppressive, and revengeful\r\ntowards those who are subjected to his control, is, we repeat, to set\r\nat nought the combined experience of the human race, to invalidate its\r\ntestimony, and to reverse its decisions from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nA volume might be filled with the testimony of American slaveholders\r\nalone, to the truth of the preceding position. We subjoin a few\r\nillustrations, and first, the memorable declaration of President\r\nJefferson, who lived and died a slaveholder. It has been published a\r\nthousand times, and will live forever. In his \"Notes on Virginia,\"\r\nsixth Philadelphia edition, p. 251, he says,--\r\n\r\n\"The WHOLE COMMERCE between master and slave, is a PERPETUAL EXERCISE\r\nof the most _boisterous passions_, the most unremitting DESPOTISM on\r\nthe one part, and degrading submission on the other..... The parent\r\n_storms_, the child looks on, catches the lineaments of _wrath_, puts\r\non the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves, GIVES LOOSE TO THE\r\nWORST OF PASSIONS; and thus _nursed, educated, and daily exercised in\r\ntyranny,_ cannot but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities.\"\r\n\r\nHon. Lewis Summers, Judge of the General Court of Virginia, and a\r\nslaveholder, said in a speech before the Virginia legislature in 1832;\r\n(see Richmond Whig of Jan. 26, 1832,)\r\n\r\n\"A slave population exercises _the most pernicious influence_ upon the\r\nmanners, habits and character, of those among whom it exists. Lisping\r\ninfancy learns the vocabulary of abusive epithets, and struts the\r\n_embryo tyrant_ of its little domain. The consciousness of superior\r\ndestiny takes possession of his mind at its earliest dawning, and love\r\nof power and rule, 'grows with his growth, and strengthens with his\r\nstrength.' Unless enabled to rise above the operation of those\r\npowerful causes, he enters the world with miserable notions of\r\nself-importance, and under the government of an unbridled temper.\"\r\n\r\nThe late JUDGE TUCKER of Virginia, a slaveholder, and Professor of Law\r\nin the University of William and Mary, in his \"Letter to a Member of\r\nthe Virginia Legislature,\" 1801, says,--\r\n\r\n\"I say nothing of the baneful effects of slavery on our _moral\r\ncharacter_, because I know you have been long sensible of this point.\"\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian Synod of South Carolina and Georgia, consisting of\r\nall the clergy of that denomination in those states, with a lay\r\nrepresentation from the churches, most, if not all of whom are\r\nslaveholders, published a report on slavery in 1834, from which the\r\nfollowing is an extract.\r\n\r\n\"Those only who have the management of servants, know what the\r\n_hardening effect_ of it is upon _their own feelings towards them._\r\nThere is no necessity to dwell on this point, as all _owners_ and\r\n_managers_ fully understand it. He who commences to manage them with\r\ntenderness and with a willingness to favor them in every way, must be\r\nwatchful, otherwise he will settle down in _indifference, if not\r\nseverity.\"_\r\n\r\nGENERAL WILLIAM H. HARRISON, now of Ohio, son of the late Governor\r\nHarrison of Virginia, a slaveholder, while minister from the United\r\nStates to the Republic of Colombia, wrote a letter to General Simon\r\nBolivar, then President of that Republic, just as he was about\r\nassuming despotic power. The letter is dated Bogota, Sept. 22, 1826.\r\nThe following is an extract.\r\n\r\n\"From a knowledge of your own disposition and present feelings, your\r\nexcellency will not be willing to believe that you could ever be\r\nbrought to an act of tyranny, or even to execute justice with\r\nunnecessary rigor. But trust me, sir, there is nothing more\r\ncorrupting, nothing more _destructive of the noblest and finest\r\nfeelings of our nature than the exercise of unlimited power_. The man,\r\nwho in the beginning of such a career, might shudder at the idea of\r\ntaking away the life of a fellow-being, might soon have his conscience\r\nso seared by the repetition of crime, that the agonies of his murdered\r\nvictims might become music to his soul, and the drippings of the\r\nscaffold afford blood to swim in. History is full of such excesses.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. FITZHUGH, Esq. of Virginia, a slaveholder, says,--\"Slavery,\r\nin its mildest form, is cruel and unnatural; _its injurious effects on\r\nour morals and habits are mutually felt.\"_\r\n\r\nHON. SAMUEL S. NICHOLAS, late Judge of the Court of Appeals of\r\nKentucky, and a slaveholder, in a speech before the legislature of\r\nthat state, Jan. 1837, says,--\r\n\r\n\"The deliberate convictions of the most matured consideration I can\r\ngive the subject, are, that the institution of slavery is a _most\r\nserious injury to the habits, manners and morals_ of our white\r\npopulation--that it leads to sloth, indolence, dissipation, and vice.\"\r\n\r\nDr. THOMAS COOPER, late President of the College of South Carolina, in\r\na note to his edition of the \"Institutes of Justinian\" page 413,\r\nsays,--\r\n\r\n\"All absolute power has a direct tendency, not only to detract from\r\nthe happiness of the persons who are subject to it, but to DEPRAVE THE\r\nGOOD QUALITIES of those who possess it..... the whole history of human\r\nnature, in the present and every former age, will justify me in saying\r\nthat _such is the tendency of power_ on the one hand and slavery on\r\nthe other.\"\r\n\r\nA South Carolina slaveholder, whose name is with the executive\r\ncommittee of the Am. A.S. Society, says, in a letter, dated April 4,\r\n1838:--\r\n\r\n\"I think it (slavery) _ruinous to the temper_ and to our spiritual\r\nlife; it is a thorn in the flesh, for ever and for ever goading us on\r\nto say and to do what the Eternal God cannot but be displeased with. I\r\nspeak from experience, and oh! my desire is to be delivered from it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur C.C. ROBIN, who was a resident of Louisiana from 1802 to\r\n1806, published a work on that country; in which, speaking of the\r\neffect of slaveholding on masters and their children, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"The young creoles make the negroes who surround them the play-things\r\nof their whims: they flog, for pastime, those of their own age, just\r\nas their fathers flog others at their will. These young creoles,\r\narrived at the age in which the passions are impetuous, do not _know\r\nhow to bear contradiction_; they will have every thing done which they\r\ncommand, _possible or not_; and in default of this, they avenge their\r\noffended pride by multiplied punishments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. GEORGE BUCHANAN, of Baltimore, Maryland, member of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, in an oration at Baltimore, July 4, 1791,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"For such are the effects of subjecting man to slavery, that it\r\n_destroys every humane principle_, vitiates the mind, instills ideas\r\nof unlawful cruelties, and eventually subverts the springs of\r\ngovernment.\"--_Buchanan's Oration_, p. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident EDWARDS the younger, in a sermon before the Connecticut\r\nAbolition Society, in 1791, page 8, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Slavery has a most direct tendency to haughtiness, and a _domineering\r\nspirit_ and conduct in the proprietors of the slaves, in their\r\nchildren, and in all who have the control of them. A man who has been\r\nbred up in domineering over negroes, can scarcely avoid contracting\r\nsuch a habit of haughtiness and domination as will express itself in\r\nhis general treatment of mankind, whether in his private capacity, or\r\nin any office, civil or military, with which he may be invested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe celebrated MONTESQUIEU, in his \"Spirit of the Laws,\" thus\r\ndescribes the effect of slaveholding upon the master:--\r\n\r\n\"The master contracts all sorts of bad habits; and becomes _haughty,\r\npassionate, obdurate, vindictive, voluptuous, and cruel_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWILBERFORCE, in his speech at the anniversary of the London\r\nAnti-Slavery Society, in March, 1828, said:--\r\n\r\n\"It is _utterly impossible_ that they who live in the administration\r\nof the petty despotism of a slave community, whose minds have been\r\n_warped_ and _polluted_ by that contamination, should not _lose that\r\nrespect_ for their fellow creatures over whom they tyrannize, which is\r\nessential in the nature and moral being of man, to rescue them from\r\nthe abuse of power over their prostrate fellow creatures.\"\r\n\r\nIn the great debate, in the British Parliament, on the African\r\nslave-trade, Mr. WHITBREAD said:\r\n\r\n\"Arbitrary power would spoil the hearts of the best.\"\r\n\r\nBut we need not multiply proofs to establish our position: it is\r\nsustained by the concurrent testimony of sages, philosophers, poets,\r\nstatesmen, and moralists, in every period of the world; and who can\r\nmarvel that those in all ages who have wisely pondered men and things,\r\nshould be unanimous in such testimony, when the history of arbitrary\r\npower has come down to us from the beginning of time, struggling\r\nthrough heaps of slain, and trailing her parchments in blood.\r\n\r\nTime would fail to begin with the first despot and track down the\r\ncarnage step by step. All nations, all ages, all climes crowd forward\r\nas witnesses, with their scars, and wounds, and dying agonies.\r\n\r\nBut to survey a multitude bewilders; let us look at a single nation.\r\nWe instance Rome; both because its history is more generally known,\r\nand because it furnishes a larger proportion of instances, in which\r\narbitrary power was exercised with comparative mildness, than any\r\nother nation ancient or modern. And yet, her whole existence was a\r\ntragedy, every actor was an executioner, the curtain rose amidst\r\nshrieks and fell upon corpses, and the only shifting of the scenes was\r\nfrom blood to blood. The whole world stood aghast, as under sentence\r\nof death, awaiting execution, and all nations and tongues were driven,\r\nwith her own citizens, as sheep to the slaughter. Of her seven kings,\r\nher hundreds of consuls, tribunes, decemvirs, and dictators, and her\r\nfifty emperors, there is hardly one whose name has come down to us\r\nunstained by horrible abuses of power; and that too, notwithstanding\r\nwe have mere shreds of the history of many of them, owing to their\r\nantiquity, or to the perturbed times in which they lived; and these\r\nshreds gathered from the records of their own partial countrymen, who\r\nwrote and sung their praises. What does this prove? Not that the\r\nRomans were worse than other men, nor that their rulers were worse\r\nthan other Romans, for history does not furnish nobler models of\r\nnatural character than many of those same rulers, when first invested\r\nwith arbitrary power. Neither was it mainly because the martial\r\nenterprise of the earlier Romans and the gross sensuality of the\r\nlater, hardened their hearts to human suffering. In both periods of\r\nRoman history, and in both these classes, we find men, the keen\r\nsympathies, generosity, and benevolence of whose general character\r\nembalmed their names in the grateful memories of multitudes. _They\r\nwere human beings, and possessed power without restraint_--this\r\nunravels the mystery.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of the Emperor Trajan, of his moderation, his\r\nclemency, his gashing sympathies, his forgiveness of injuries and\r\nforgetfulness of self, his tearing in pieces his own robe, to furnish\r\nbandages for the wounded--called by the whole world in his day, \"the\r\nbest emperor of Rome;\" and so affectionately regarded by his subjects,\r\nthat, ever afterwards, in blessing his successors upon their accession\r\nto power, they always said, \"May you have the virtue and goodness of\r\nTrajan!\" yet the deadly conflicts of gladiators who were trained to\r\nkill each other, to make sport for the spectators, furnished his chief\r\npastime. At one time he kept up those spectacles for 123 days in\r\nsuccession. In the tortures which he inflicted on Christians, fire\r\nand poison, daggers and dungeons, wild beasts and serpents, and the\r\nrack, did their worst. He threw into the sea, Clemens, the venerable\r\nbishop of Rome, with an anchor about his neck; and tossed to the\r\nfamished lions in the amphitheatre the aged Ignatius.\r\n\r\nPliny the younger, who was proconsul under Trajan, may well be\r\nmentioned in connection with the emperor, as a striking illustration\r\nof the truth, that goodness and amiableness towards one class of men\r\nis often turned into cruelty towards another. History can hardly show\r\na more gentle and lovely character than Pliny. While pleading at the\r\nbar, he always sought out the grievances of the poorest and most\r\ndespised persons, entered into their wrongs with his whole soul, and\r\nnever took a fee. Who can read his admirable letters without being\r\ntouched by their tenderness and warmed by their benignity and\r\nphilanthropy: and yet, this tender-hearted Pliny coolly plied with\r\nexcruciating torture two spotless females, who had served as\r\ndeaconesses in the Christian church, hoping to extort from them matter\r\nof accusation against the Christians. He commanded Christians to\r\nabjure their faith, invoke the gods, pour out libations to the statues\r\nof the emperor, burn incense to idols, and curse Christ. If they\r\nrefused, he ordered them to execution.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of the Emperor Titus--so beloved for his mild\r\nvirtues and compassionate regard for the suffering, that he was named\r\n\"The Delight of Mankind;\" so tender of the lives of his subjects that\r\nhe took the office of high priest, that his hands might never be\r\ndefiled with blood; and was heard to declare, with tears, that he had\r\nrather die than put another to death. So intent upon making others\r\nhappy, that when once about to retire to sleep, and not being able to\r\nrecall any particular act of beneficence performed during the day, he\r\ncried out in anguish, \"Alas! I have lost a day!\"  And, finally, whom\r\nthe learned Kennet, in his Roman Antiquities, characterizes as \"the\r\nonly prince in the world that has the character of _never doing an ill\r\naction_.\"  Yet, witnessing the mortal combats of the captives taken to\r\nwar, killing each other in the amphitheatre, amidst the acclamations\r\nof the populace, was a favorite amusement with Titus. At one time he\r\nexhibited shows of gladiators, which lasted one hundred days, during\r\nwhich the amphitheatre was flooded with human blood. At another of\r\nhis public exhibitions he caused five thousand wild beasts to be\r\nbaited in the amphitheatre. During the siege of Jerusalem, he set\r\nambushes to seize the famishing Jews, who stole out of the city by\r\nnight to glean food in the valleys: these he would first dreadfully\r\nscourge, then torment them with all conceivable tortures, and, at\r\nlast, crucify them before the wall of the city. According to\r\nJosephus, not less than five hundred a day were thus tormented. And\r\nwhen many of the Jews, frantic with famine, deserted to the Romans,\r\nTitus cut off their hands and drove them back. After the destruction\r\nof Jerusalem, he dragged to Rome one hundred thousand captives, sold\r\nthem as slaves, and scattered them through every province of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe kindness, condescension, and forbearance of Adrian were\r\nproverbial; he was one of the most eloquent orators of his age; and\r\nwhen pleading the cause of injured innocence, would melt and overwhelm\r\nthe auditors by the pathos of his appeals. It was his constant maxim,\r\nthat he was an Emperor, not for his own good, but for the benefit of\r\nhis fellow creatures. He stooped to relieve the wants of the meanest\r\nof his subjects, and would peril his life by visiting them when sick\r\nof infectious diseases; he prohibited, by law, masters from killing\r\ntheir slaves, gave to slaves legal trial, and exempted them from\r\ntorture; yet towards certain individuals and classes, he showed\r\nhimself a monster of cruelty. He prided himself on his knowledge of\r\narchitecture, and ordered to execution the most celebrated architect\r\nof Rome, because he had criticised one of the Emperor's designs. He\r\nbanished all the Jews from their native land, and drove them to the\r\nends of the earth; and unloosed the bloodhounds of persecution to rend\r\nin pieces his Christian subjects.\r\n\r\nThe gentleness and benignity of the Emperor Aurelius, have been\r\ncelebrated in story and song. History says of him, 'Nothing could\r\nquench his desire of being a blessing to mankind;' and Pope's eulogy\r\nof him is in the mouth of every schoolboy--'Like good Aurelius, let\r\nhim reign;' and yet, '_good_ Aurelius,' lifted the flood gates of the\r\nfourth, and one of the most terrible persecutions against Christians\r\nthat ever raged. He sent orders into different parts of his empire,\r\nto have the Christians murdered who would not deny Christ. The\r\nblameless Polycarp, trembling under the weight of a hundred years, was\r\ndragged to the stake and burned to ashes. Pothinus, Bishop of Lyons,\r\nat the age of ninety, was dragged through the streets, beaten, stoned,\r\ntrampled upon by the soldiers, and left to perish. Tender virgins\r\nwere put into nets, and thrown to infuriated wild bulls; others were\r\nfastened in red hot iron chairs; and venerable matrons were thrown to\r\nbe devoured by dogs.\r\n\r\nConstantine the Great has been the admiration of Christendom for his\r\nvirtues. The early Christian writers adorn his justice, benevolence\r\nand piety with the most exalted eulogy. He was baptized, and admitted\r\nto the Christian church. He abrogated Paganism, and made Christianity\r\nthe religion of his empire; he attended the councils of the early\r\nfathers of the church, consulted with the bishops, and devoted himself\r\nwith the most untiring zeal to the propagation of Christianity, and to\r\nthe promotion of peace and love among its professors; he convened the\r\nCouncil of Nice, to settle disputes which had long distracted the\r\nchurch, appeared in the assembly with admirable modesty and temper,\r\nmoderated the heats of the contending parties, implored them to\r\nexercise mutual forbearance, and exhorted them to love unfeigned, to\r\nforgive one another, as they hoped to be forgiven by Christ. Who would\r\nnot think it uncharitable to accuse such a man of barbarity in the\r\nexercise of power?--and yet he drove Arius and his associates into\r\nbanishment, for opinion's sake, denounced death against all with whom\r\nhis books should afterwards be found, and prohibited, on pain of\r\ndeath, the exercise, however peaceably, of the functions of any other\r\nreligion than Christianity. In a fit of jealousy and rage, he ordered\r\nhis innocent son, Crispus, to execution, without granting him a\r\nhearing; and upon finding him innocent, killed his own wife, who had\r\nfalsely accused him.\r\n\r\nTo the preceding maybe added Theodosius the Great, the last Roman\r\nemperor before the division of the empire. He was a member of the\r\nChristian church, and in his zeal against paganism, and what he deemed\r\nheresy, surpassed all who were before him. The Christian writers of\r\nhis time speak of him as a most illustrious model of justice,\r\ngenerosity, magnanimity, benevolence, and every virtue. And yet\r\nTheodosius denounced capital punishments against those who held\r\n'heretical' opinions, and commanded inter-marriage between cousins to\r\nbe punished by burning the parties alive. On hearing that the people\r\nof Antioch had demolished the statues set up in that city, in honor of\r\nhimself, and had threatened the governor, he flew into a transport of\r\nfury, ordered the city to be laid in ashes, and all the inhabitants to\r\nbe slaughtered; and upon hearing of a resistance to his authority in\r\nThessalonica, in which one of his lieutenants was killed, he instantly\r\nordered a _general massacre_ of the inhabitants; and in obedience to\r\nhis command, seven thousand men, women and children were butchered in\r\nthe space of three hours.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are a few of many instances in the history of Rome, and\r\nof a countless multitude in the history of the world, illustrating the\r\ntruth, that the lodgement of arbitrary power, in the best human hands,\r\nis always a fearfully perilous experiment; that the mildest tempers,\r\nthe most humane and benevolent dispositions, the most blameless and\r\nconscientious previous life, with the most rigorous habits of justice,\r\nare no security, that, in a moment of temptation, the possessors of\r\nsuch power will not make their subjects their victims; illustrating\r\nalso the truth, that, while men may exhibit nothing but honor,\r\nhonesty, mildness, justice, and generosity, in their intercourse with\r\nthose of their own grade, or language, or nation, or hue, they may\r\npractice towards others, for whom they have contempt and aversion, the\r\nmost revolting meanness, perpetrate robbery unceasingly, and inflict\r\nthe severest privations, and the most barbarous cruelties. But this is\r\nnot all: history is full of examples, showing not only the effects of\r\narbitrary power on its victims, but its terrible reaction on those who\r\nexercise it; blunting their sympathies, and hardening to adamant their\r\nhearts toward _them_, at least, if not toward the human race\r\ngenerally. This is shown in the fact, that almost every tyrant in the\r\nhistory of the world, has entered upon the exercise of absolute power\r\nwith comparative moderation; multitudes of them with marked\r\nforbearance and mildness, and not a few with the most signal\r\ncondescension, magnanimity, gentleness and compassion. Among these\r\nlast are included those who afterwards became the bloodiest monsters\r\nthat ever cursed the earth. Of the Roman Emperors, almost every one of\r\nwhom perpetrated the most barbarous atrocities, Vitellius seems to\r\nhave been the only one who cruelly exercised his power from the\r\n_outset_. Most of the other emperors, sprung up into fiends in the\r\nhot-bed of arbitrary power. If they had not been plied with its fiery\r\nstimulants, but had lived under the legal restraints of other men,\r\ninstead of going to the grave under the curses of their generation,\r\nmultitudes might have called them blessed.\r\n\r\nThe moderation which has generally distinguished absolute monarchs at\r\nthe commencement of their reigns, was doubtless in some cases assumed\r\nfrom policy; in the greater number, however, as is manifest from their\r\nhistory, it has been the natural workings of minds held in check by\r\nprevious associations, and not yet hardened into habits of cruelty, by\r\nbeing accustomed to the exercise of power without restraint. But as\r\nthose associations have weakened, and the wielding of uncontrolled\r\nsway has become a habit, like other evil doers, they have, in the\r\nexpressive language of Scripture, 'waxed worse and worse.'\r\n\r\nFor eighteen hundred years an involuntary shudder has run over the\r\nhuman race, at the mention of the name of Nero; yet, at the\r\ncommencement of his reign, he burst into tears when called upon to\r\nsign the death-warrant of a criminal, and exclaimed, 'Oh, that I had\r\nnever learned to write!' His mildness and magnanimity won the\r\naffections of his subjects; and it was not till the poison of absolute\r\npower had worked within his nature for years, that it swelled him into\r\na monster.\r\n\r\nTiberius, Claudius, and Caligula, began the exercise of their power\r\nwith singular forbearance, and each grew into a prodigy of cruelty. So\r\naverse was Caligula to bloodshed, that he refused to look at a list of\r\nconspirators against his own life, which was handed to him; yet\r\nafterwards, a more cruel wretch never wielded a sceptre. In his thirst\r\nfor slaughter, he wished all the necks in Rome _one_, that he might\r\ncut them off at a blow.\r\n\r\nDomitian, at the commencement of his reign, carried his abhorrence of\r\ncruelty to such lengths, that he forbad the sacrificing of oxen, and\r\nwould sit whole days on the judgment-seat, reversing the unjust\r\ndecisions of corrupt judges; yet afterwards, he surpassed even Nero in\r\ncruelty. The latter was content to torture and kill by proxy, and\r\nwithout being a spectator; but Domitian could not be denied the luxury\r\nof seeing his victims writhe, and hearing them shriek; and often with\r\nhis own hand directed the instrument of torture, especially when some\r\nillustrious senator or patrician was to be killed by piece-meal.\r\nCommodus began with gentleness and condescension, but soon became a\r\nterror and a scourge, outstripping in his atrocities most of his\r\npredecessors. Maximin too, was just and generous when first invested\r\nwith power, but afterwards rioted in slaughter with the relish of a\r\nfiend. History has well said of this monarch, 'the change in his\r\ndisposition may readily serve to show how dangerous a thing is power,\r\nthat could transform a person of such rigid virtues into such a\r\nmonster.'\r\n\r\nInstances almost innumerable might be furnished in the history of\r\nevery age, illustrating the blunting of sympathies, and the total\r\ntransformation of character wrought in individuals by the exercise of\r\narbitrary power. Not to detain the reader with long details, let a\r\nsingle instance suffice.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no man has lived in modern times, whose name excites such\r\nhorror as that of Robespierre. Yet it is notorious that he was\r\nnaturally of a benevolent disposition, and tender sympathies.\r\n\r\n\"Before the revolution, when as a judge in his native city of Arras he\r\nhad to pronounce judgment on an assassin, he took no food for two days\r\nafterwards, but was heard frequently exclaiming, 'I am sure he was\r\nguilty; he is a villain; but yet, to put a human being to death!!' He\r\ncould not support the idea; and that the same necessity might not\r\nrecur, he relinquished his judicial office.--(See Laponneray's Life of\r\nRobespierre, p. 8.) Afterwards, in the Convention of 1791, he urged\r\nstrongly the abolition of the punishment of death; and yet, for\r\nsixteen months, in 1793 and 1794, till he perished himself by the same\r\nguillotine which he had so mercilessly used on others, no one at Paris\r\nconsigned and caused so many fellow-creatures to be put to death by\r\nit, with more ruthless insensibility.\"--_Turner's Sacred history of\r\nthe World_, vol. 2 p. 119.\r\n\r\nBut it is time we had done with the objection, \"such cruelties are\r\nINCREDIBLE.\" If the objector still reiterates it, he shall have the\r\nlast word without farther molestation.\r\n\r\nAn objection kindred to the preceding now claims notice. It is the\r\nprofound induction that slaves _must_ be well treated because\r\n_slaveholders say they are!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION. II.--'SLAVEHOLDERS PROTEST THAT THEY TREAT THEIR SLAVES\r\nWELL.'\r\n\r\nSelf-justification is human nature; self-condemnation is a sublime\r\ntriumph over it, and as rare as sublime. What culprits would be\r\nconvicted, if their own testimony were taken by juries as good\r\nevidence? Slaveholders are on trial, charged with cruel treatment to\r\ntheir slaves, and though in their own courts they can clear themselves\r\n_by their own oaths_,[21] they need not think to do it at the bar of\r\nthe world. The denial of crimes, by men accused of them, goes for\r\nnothing as evidence in all _civilized_ courts; while the voluntary\r\nconfession of them, is the best evidence possible, as it is testimony\r\n_against themselves_, and in the face of the strongest motives to\r\nconceal the truth. On the preceding pages, are hundreds of just such\r\ntestimonies; the voluntary and explicit testimony of slaveholders\r\nagainst themselves, their families and ancestors, their constituents\r\nand their rulers; against their characters and their memories; against\r\ntheir justice, their honesty, their honor and their benevolence. Now\r\nlet candor decide between those two classes of slaveholders, which is\r\nmost entitled to credit; that which testifies in its own favor, just\r\nas self-love would dictate, or that which testifies against all\r\nselfish motives and in spite of them; and though it has nothing to\r\ngain, but every thing to lose by such testimony, still utters it.\r\n\r\nBut if there were no counter testimony, if all slaveholders were\r\nunanimous in the declaration that the treatment of the slaves is\r\n_good_, such a declaration would not be entitled to a feather's weight\r\nas testimony; it is not _testimony_ but _opinion_. Testimony respects\r\nmatters of _fact_, not matters of opinion: it is the declaration of a\r\nwitness as to _facts_, not the giving of an opinion as to the nature\r\nor qualities of actions, or the _character_ of a course of conduct.\r\nSlaveholders organize themselves into a tribunal to adjudicate upon\r\ntheir own conduct, and give us in their decisions, their estimate of\r\ntheir own character; informing us with characteristic modesty, that\r\nthey have a high opinion of themselves; that in their own judgment\r\nthey are very mild, kind, and merciful gentlemen! In these conceptions\r\nof their own merits, and of the eminent propriety of their bearing\r\ntowards their slaves, slaveholders remind us of the Spaniard, who\r\nalways took off his hat whenever he spoke of himself, and of the\r\nGovernor of Schiraz, who, from a sense of justice to his own character\r\nadded to his other titles, those of, 'Flower of Courtesy,' 'Nutmeg of\r\nConsolation,' and 'Rose of Delight.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The law of which the following is an extract, exists in\r\nSouth Carolina. \"If any slave shall suffer in life, limb or member,\r\nwhen no white person shall be present, or being present, shall refuse\r\nto give evidence, the owner or other person, who shall have the care\r\nof such slave, and in whose power such slave shall be, shall be deemed\r\nguilty of such offence, _unless_ such owner or other person shall make\r\nthe contrary appear by good and sufficient evidence, or shall BY HIS\r\nOWN OATH CLEAR AND EXCULPATE HIMSELF. Which oath every court where\r\nsuch offence shall be tried, is hereby compared to administer, and to\r\n_acquit the offender_, if clear proof of the offence be not made by\r\n_two_ witnesses at least.\"--2 Brevard's Digest, 242. The state of\r\nLouisiana has a similar law.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _sincerity_ of those worthies, no one calls in question; their\r\nreal notions of their own merits doubtless ascended into the sublime:\r\nbut for aught that appears, they had not the arrogance to demand that\r\ntheir own notions of their personal excellence, should be taken as the\r\n_proof_ of it. Not so with our slaveholders. Not content with offering\r\nincense at the shrine of their own virtues, they have the effrontery\r\nto demand, that the rest of the world shall offer it, because _they_\r\ndo; and shall implicitly believe the presiding divinity to be a good\r\nSpirit rather than a Devil, because _they_ call him so! In other\r\nwords, since slaveholders profoundly appreciate their own gentle\r\ndispositions toward their slaves, and their kind treatment of them,\r\nand everywhere protest that they do truly show forth these rare\r\nexcellencies, they demand that the rest of the world shall not only\r\nbelieve that they _think_ so, but that they think _rightly_; that\r\nthese notions of themselves are _true_, that their taking off their\r\nhats to themselves proves them worthy of homage, and that their\r\nassumption of the titles of, 'Flower of Kindness,' and 'Nutmeg of\r\nConsolation,' is conclusive evidence that they deserve such\r\nappellations!\r\n\r\nWas there ever a more ridiculous doctrine, than that a man's opinion\r\nof his own actions is the true standard for measuring them, and the\r\ncertificate of their real qualities!--that his own estimate of his\r\ntreatment of others; is to be taken as the true one, and such\r\ntreatment be set down as _good_ treatment upon the strength of his\r\njudgment. He who argues the good treatment of the slave, from the\r\nslaveholder's _good opinion_ of such treatment, not only argues\r\nagainst human nature and all history, his own common sense, and even\r\nthe testimony of his senses, but refutes his own arguments by his\r\ndaily practice. Every body acts on the presumption that men's feelings\r\nwill vary with their _practices_; that the light in which they view\r\nindividuals and classes, and their feelings towards them, will modify\r\ntheir opinions of the treatment which they receive. In any case of\r\ntreatment that affects himself, his church, or his political party, no\r\nman so stultifies himself as to argue that such treatment must be\r\ngood, because the _author_ of it thinks so.\r\n\r\nWho would argue that the American Colonies were well treated by the\r\nmother country, because parliament thought so? Or that Poland was well\r\ntreated by Russia, because Nicholas thought so? Or that the treatment\r\nof the Cherokees by Georgia is proved good by Georgia notions of it?\r\nOr that of the Greeks by the Turks, by Turkish opinions of it? Or that\r\nof the Jews by almost all nations, by the judgment of their\r\npersecutors? Or that of the victims of the Inquisition, by the\r\nopinions of the Inquisitor general, or of the Pope and his cardinals?\r\nOr that of the Quakers and Baptists, at the hands of the Puritans,--to\r\nbe judged of by the opinions of the legislatures that authorized, and\r\nthe courts that carried it into effect. All those classes of persons\r\ndid not, in their own opinion, abuse their victims. If charged with\r\nperpetrating outrageous cruelty upon them, all those oppressors would\r\nhave repelled the charge with indignation.\r\n\r\nOur slaveholders chime lustily the same song, and no man with human\r\nnature within him, and human history before him, and with sense enough\r\nto keep him out of the fire, will be gulled by such professions,\r\nunless his itch to be humbugged has put on the type of a downright\r\nchronic incurable. We repeat it--when men speak of the treatment of\r\nothers as being either good or bad, their declarations are not\r\ngenerally to be taken as testimony to matters of _fact_, so much as\r\nexpressions of _their own feelings_ towards those persons or classes\r\nwho are the subjects of such treatment. If those persons are their\r\nfellow citizens; if they are in the same class of society with\r\nthemselves; of the same language, creed, and color; similar in their\r\nhabits, pursuits, and sympathies; they will keenly feel any wrong done\r\nto them, and denounce it as base, outrageous treatment; but let the\r\nsame wrongs be done to persons of a condition in all respects the\r\nreverse, persons whom they habitually despise, and regard only in the\r\nlight of mere conveniences, to be used for their pleasure, and the\r\nidea that such treatment is barbarous will be laughed at as\r\nridiculous. When we hear slaveholders say that their slaves are _well\r\ntreated_, we have only to remember that they are not speaking of\r\n_persons_, but of _property_; not of men and women, but of _chattels_\r\nand _things_; not of friends but of _vassals_ and _victims_; not of\r\nthose whom they respect and honor, but of those whom they _scorn_ and\r\ntrample on; not of those with whom they sympathize, and co-operate,\r\nand interchange courtesies, but of those whom they regard with\r\ncontempt and aversion and disdainfully set with the dogs of their\r\nflock. Reader, keep this fact in your mind, and you will have a clue\r\nto the slaveholder's definition of \"_good treatment_.\" Remember also,\r\nthat a part of this \"good treatment\" of which the slaveholders boast,\r\nis plundering the slaves of all their inalienable rights, of the\r\nownership of their own bodies, of the use of their own limbs and\r\nmuscles, of all their time, liberty, and earnings, of the free\r\nexercise of choice, of the rights of marriage and parental authority,\r\nof legal protection, of the right to be, to do, to go, to stay, to\r\nthink, to feel, to work, to rest, to eat, to sleep, to learn, to\r\nteach, to earn money, and to expend it, to visit, and to be visited,\r\nto speak, to be silent, to worship according to conscience, in fine,\r\ntheir right to be protected by just and equal laws, and to be\r\n_amenable to such only_. Of _all these rights the slaves are\r\nplundered_; and this is a _part_ of that \"good treatment\" of which\r\ntheir plunderers boast! What then is the _rest_ of it? The above is\r\nenough for a sample, at least a specimen-brick from the kiln. Reader,\r\nwe ask you no questions, but merely tell you what _you know_, when we\r\nsay that men and women who can habitually do such things to human\r\nbeings, _can do_ ANY THING _to them_.\r\n\r\nThe declarations of slaveholders, that they treat their slaves well,\r\nwill put no man in a quandary, who keeps in mind this simple\r\nprinciple, that the state of mind towards others, which leads one to\r\ninflict cruelties on them _blinds the inflicter to the real nature of\r\nhis own acts_. To him, they do not _seem_ to be cruelties;\r\nconsequently, when speaking of such treatment toward such persons, he\r\nwill protest that it is not cruelty; though if inflicted upon himself\r\nor his friends, he would indignantly stigmatize it as atrocious\r\nbarbarity. The objector equally overlooks another every-day fact of\r\nhuman nature, which is this, that cruelties invariably cease to _seem_\r\ncruelties when the _habit_ is formed though previously the mind\r\nregarded them as such, and shrunk from them with horror.\r\n\r\nThe following fact, related by the late lamented THOMAS PRINGLE, whose\r\nLife and Poems have published in England, is an appropriate\r\nillustration. Mr. Pringle states it on the authority of Captain W. F.\r\nOwen, of the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\n\"When his Majesty's ships, the Leven and the Barracouta, employed in\r\nsurveying the coast of Africa, were at Mozambique, in 1823, the\r\nofficers were introduced to the family of Senor Manuel Pedro\r\nd'Almeydra, a native of Portugal, who was a considerable merchant\r\nsettled on that coast; and it was an opinion agreed in by all, that\r\nDonna Sophia d'Almeydra was the most superior woman they had seen\r\nsince they left England, Captain Owen, the leader of the expedition,\r\nexpressing to Senor d'Almeydra his detestation of slavery, the Senor\r\nreplied, 'You will not be long here before you change your sentiments.\r\nLook at my Sophia there. Before she would marry me, she made me\r\npromise that I should give up the slave trade. When we first settled\r\nat Mozambique, she was continually interceding for the slaves, and she\r\n_constantly wept when I punished them_; and now she is among the\r\nslaves front morning to night; she regulates the whole of my slave\r\nestablishment; she inquires into every offence committed by them,\r\npronounces sentence upon the offender, and _stands by and sees them\r\npunished_.'\r\n\r\n\"To this, Mr. Pringle, who was himself for six years a resident of the\r\nEnglish settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, adds, 'The writer of this\r\narticle has seen, in the course of five or six years, as great a\r\nchange upon English ladies and gentleman of respectability, as that\r\ndescribed to have taken place in Donna Sophia d'Almeydra; and one of\r\nthe individuals whom he has in his eye, while he writes this passage,\r\nlately confessed to him this melancholy change, remarking at the same\r\ntime, 'how altered I am in my feelings with regard to slavery. I do\r\nnot appear to myself the same person I was on my arrival in this\r\ncolony, and if I would give the world for the feelings I then had, I\r\ncould not recall them.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSlaveholders know full well that familiarity with slavery produces\r\nindifference to its cruelties and reconciles the mind to them. The\r\nlate Judge Tucker, a Virginia slaveholder and professor of law in the\r\nUniversity of William and Mary, in the appendix to his edition of\r\nBlackstone's Commentaries, part 2, pp. 56, 57, commenting on the law\r\nof Virginia previous to 1792, which outlawed fugitive slaves, says:\r\n\r\n\"Such are the cruelties to which slavery gives rise, such the horrors\r\nto which the mind becomes _reconciled_ by its adoption.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following facts from the pen of CHARLES STUART, happily illustrate\r\nthe same principle:\r\n\r\n\"A young lady, the daughter of a Jamaica planter, was sent at an early\r\nage to school to England, and after completing her education, returned\r\nto her native country.\r\n\r\n\"She is now settled with her husband and family in England. I visited\r\nher near Bath, early last spring, (1834.) Conversing on the above\r\nsubject, the paralyzing effects of slaveholding on the heart, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"'While at school in England, I often thought with peculiar tenderness\r\nof the kindness of a slave who had nursed and carried me about. Upon\r\nreturning to my father's, one of my first inquiries was about him. I\r\nwas deeply afflicted to find that he was on the point of undergoing a\r\n\"law flogging for having run away.\" I threw myself at my father's feet\r\nand implored with tears, his pardon; but my father steadily replied,\r\nthat it would ruin the discipline of the plantation, and that the\r\npunishment must take place. I wept in vain, and retired so grieved and\r\ndisgusted, that for some days after, I could scarcely bear with\r\npatience, the sight of my own father. But many months had not elapsed\r\nere _I was as ready as any body_ to seize the domestic whip, _and flog\r\nmy slaves without hesitation_.'\r\n\r\n\"This lady is one of the most Christian and noble minds of my\r\nacquaintance. She and her husband distinguished themselves several\r\nyears ago, in Jamaica, by immediately emancipating their slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lady, now in the West Indies, was sent in her infancy, to her\r\nfriends, near Belfast, in Ireland, for education. She remained under\r\ntheir charge from five to fifteen years of age, and grew up every\r\nthing which her friends could wish. At fifteen, she returned to the\r\nWest Indies--was married--and after some years paid her friends near\r\nBelfast, a second visit. Towards white people, she was the same\r\nelegant, and interesting woman as before; apparently full of every\r\nvirtuous and tender feeling; but towards the colored people she was\r\nlike a tigress. If Wilberforce's name was mentioned, she would say,\r\n'Oh, I wish we had the wretch in the West Indies, I would be one of\r\nthe first to help to tear his heart out!'--and then she would tell of\r\nthe manner in which the West Indian ladies used to treat their slaves.\r\n'I have often,' she said, 'when my women have displeased me, snatched\r\ntheir baby from their bosom, and running with it to a well, have tied\r\nmy shawl round its shoulders and pretended to be drowning it: oh, it\r\nwas so funny to hear the mother's screams!'--and then she laughed\r\nalmost convulsively at the recollection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN M. NELSON, a native of Virginia, whose testimony is on a\r\npreceding page, furnishes a striking illustration of the principle in\r\nhis own case. He says:\r\n\r\n\"When I was quite a child, I recollect it grieved me very much to see\r\none tied up to be whipped, and I used to intercede _with tears in\r\ntheir behalf_, and _mingle my cries with theirs_, and feel almost\r\nwilling to take part of the punishment. Yet such is the hardening\r\nnature of such scenes, that from this kind of commiseration for the\r\nsuffering slave, I became so blunted that I could not only witness\r\ntheir stripes with composure, but _myself_ inflict them, and that\r\nwithout remorse. When I was perhaps fourteen or fifteen years of age,\r\nI undertook to correct a young fellow named Ned, for some supposed\r\noffence, I think it was leaving a bridle out of its proper place; he\r\nbeing larger and stronger than myself took hold of my arms and held\r\nme, in order to prevent my striking him; this I considered the height\r\nof insolence, and cried for help, when my father and mother both came\r\nrunning to my rescue. My father stripped and tied him, and took him\r\ninto the orchard, where switches were plenty, and directed me to whip\r\nhim; when one switch wore out he supplied me with others. After I had\r\nwhipped him a while, he fell on his knees to implore forgiveness, and\r\nI kicked him in the face; my father said, 'don't kick him but whip\r\nhim,' this I did until his back was literally covered with _welts_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nW.C. GILDERSLEEVE, Esq., a native of Georgia, now elder of the\r\nPresbyterian church, Wilkes-barre, Penn. after describing the flogging\r\nof a slave, in which his hands were tied together, and the slave\r\nhoisted by a rope, so that his feet could not touch the ground; in\r\nwhich condition one hundred lashes were inflicted, says:\r\n\r\n\"I stood by and witnessed the whole without feeling the least\r\ncompassion; so _hardening_ is the influence of slavery that it _very\r\nmuch destroys feeling for the slave_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. CHILD, in her admirable \"Appeal,\" has the following remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The ladies who remove from the free States into the slaveholding ones\r\nalmost invariably write that the sight of slavery was at first\r\nexceedingly painful; but that they soon become habituated to it; and\r\nafter a while, they are very apt to vindicate the system, upon the\r\nground that it is extremely convenient to have such submissive\r\nservants. This reason was actually given by a lady of my acquaintance,\r\nwho is considered an unusually fervent Christian. Yet Christianity\r\nexpressly teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This shows how\r\ndangerous it is, for even the best of us, to become _accustomed_ to\r\nwhat is wrong.\r\n\r\n\"A judicious and benevolent friend lately told me the story of one of\r\nher relatives, who married a slave owner, and removed to his\r\nplantation. The lady in question was considered very amiable, and had\r\na serene, affectionate expression of countenance. After several years\r\nresidence among her slaves, she visited New England. 'Her history was\r\nwritten in her face,' said my friend; 'its expression had changed into\r\nthat of a fiend. She brought but few slaves with her; and those few\r\nwere of course compelled to perform additional labor. One faithful\r\nnegro woman nursed the twins of her mistress, and did all the washing,\r\nironing, and scouring. If, after a sleepless night with the restless\r\nbabes, (driven from the bosom of their mother,) she performed her\r\ntoilsome avocations with diminished activity, her mistress, with her\r\nown lady-like hands, applied the cowskin, and the neighborhood\r\nresounded with the cries of her victim. The instrument of punishment\r\nwas actually kept hanging in the entry, to the no small disgust of her\r\nNew England visitors. 'For my part,' continued my friend, 'I did not\r\ntry to be polite to her; for I was not hypocrite enough to conceal my\r\nindignation.'\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the greatest cruelties may be exercised quite\r\nunconsciously when cruelty has become a habit, and that at the same\r\ntime, the mind may feel great sympathy and commiseration towards other\r\npersons and even towards irrational animals, is illustrated in the\r\ncase of Tameriane the Great. In his Life, written by himself, he\r\nspeaks with the greatest sincerity and tenderness of his grief at\r\nhaving accidentally crushed an ant; and yet he ordered melted lead to\r\nbe poured down the throats of certain persons who drank wine contrary\r\nto his commands. He was manifestly sincere in thinking himself humane,\r\nand when speaking of the most atrocious cruelties perpetrated by\r\nhimself, it does not seem to ruffle in the least the self-complacency\r\nwith which he regards his own humanity and piety. In one place he\r\nsays, \"I never undertook anything but I commenced it placing my faith\r\non God\"--and he adds soon after, \"the people of Shiraz took part with\r\nShah Mansur, and put my governor to death; I therefore ordered _a\r\ngeneral massacre of all the inhabitants_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most common caprices of human nature, for the heart\r\nto become by habit, not only totally insensible to certain forms of\r\ncruelty, which at first gave it inexpressible pain, but even to find\r\nits chief amusement in such cruelties, till utterly intoxicated by\r\ntheir stimulation; while at the same time the mind seems to be pained\r\nas keenly as ever, at forms of cruelty to which it has not become\r\naccustomed, thus retaining _apparently_ the same general\r\nsusceptibilities. Illustrations of this are to be found every where;\r\none happens to lie before us. Bourgoing, in his history of modern\r\nSpain, speaking of the bull fights, the barbarous national amusement\r\nof the Spaniards, says:\r\n\r\n\"Young ladies, old men, people of all ages and of all characters are\r\npresent, and yet the habit of attending these bloody festivals does\r\nnot correct their weakness or their timidity, nor injure the sweetness\r\nof their manners. I have moreover known foreigners, distinguished by\r\nthe gentleness of their manners, who experienced at first seeing a\r\nbull-fight such very violent emotions as made them turn pale, and they\r\nbecame ill; but, notwithstanding, this entertainment became afterwards\r\nan irresistible attraction, without operating any revolution in their\r\ncharacters.\" Modern State of Spain, by J. F. Bourgoing, Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary from France to the Court of Madrid, Vol ii., page 342.\r\n\r\nIt is the _novelty_ of cruelty, rather than the _degree_, which repels\r\nmost minds. Cruelty in a _new_ form, however slight, will often pain a\r\nmind that is totally unmoved by the most horrible cruelties in a form\r\nto which it is _accustomed_. When Pompey was at the zenith of his\r\npopularity in Rome, he ordered some elephants to be tortured in the\r\namphitheatre for the amusement of the populace; this was the first\r\ntime they had witnessed the torture of those animals, and though for\r\nyears accustomed to witness in the same place, the torture of lions,\r\ntigers, leopards, and almost all sorts of wild beasts, as well as that\r\nof men of all nations, and to shout acclamations over their agonies,\r\nyet, this _novel form_ of cruelty so shocked the beholders, that the\r\nmost popular man in Rome was execrated as a cruel monster, and came\r\nnear falling a victim to the fury of those who just before were ready\r\nto adore him.\r\n\r\nWe will now briefly notice another objection, somewhat akin to the\r\npreceding, and based mainly upon the same and similar fallacies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION III.--'SLAVEHOLDERS ARE PROVERBIAL FOR THEIR KINDNESS,\r\nHOSPITALITY, BENEVOLENCE, AND GENEROSITY.'\r\n\r\nMultitudes scout as fictions the cruelties inflicted upon slaves,\r\nbecause slaveholders are famed for their courtesy and hospitality.\r\nThey tell us that their generous and kind attentions to their guests,\r\nand their well-known sympathy for the suffering, sufficiently prove\r\nthe charges of cruelty brought against them to be calumnies, of which\r\ntheir uniform character is a triumphant refutation.\r\n\r\nNow that slaveholders are proverbially hospitable to their guests, and\r\nspare neither pains nor expense in ministering to their accommodation\r\nand pleasure, is freely admitted and easily accounted for. That those\r\nwho make their inferiors work for them, without pay, should be\r\ncourteous and hospitable to those of their equals and superiors whose\r\ngood opinions they desire, is human nature in its every-day dress. The\r\nobjection consists of a fact and an inference: the fact, that\r\nslaveholders have a special care to the accommodation of their\r\n_guests;_ the inference, that therefore they must seek the comfort of\r\ntheir _slaves_--that as they are bland and obliging to their equals,\r\nthey must be mild and condescending to their inferiors--that as the\r\nwrongs of their own grade excite their indignation, and their woes\r\nmove their sympathies, they must be touched by those of their\r\nchattels--that as they are full of pains-taking toward those whose\r\ngood opinions and good offices they seek, they will, of course, show\r\nspecial attention to those to whose good opinions they are\r\nindifferent, and whose good offices they can _compel_--that as they\r\nhonor the literary and scientific, they must treat with high\r\nconsideration those to whom they deny the alphabet--that as they are\r\ncourteous to certain _persons_, they must be so to \"property\"--eager\r\nto anticipate the wishes of visitors, they cannot but gratify those of\r\ntheir vassals--jealous for the rights of the Texans, quick to feel at\r\nthe disfranchisement of Canadians and of Irishmen, alive to the\r\noppressions of the Greeks and the Poles, they must feel keenly for\r\ntheir _negroes!_ Such conclusions from such premises do not call for\r\nserious refutation. Even a half-grown boy, who should argue, that\r\nbecause men have certain feelings toward certain persons in certain\r\ncircumstances, they must have the same feelings toward all persons in\r\nall circumstances, or toward persons in opposite circumstances, of\r\ntotally different grades, habits, and personal peculiarities, might\r\nfairly be set down as a hopeless simpleton: and yet, men of sense and\r\nreflection on other subjects, seem bent upon stultifying themselves by\r\njust such shallow inferences from the fact, that slaveholders are\r\nhospitable and generous to certain persons in certain grades of\r\nsociety belonging to their own caste. On the ground of this reasoning,\r\nall the crimes ever committed may be disproved, by showing, that their\r\nperpetrators were hospitable and generous to those who sympathized and\r\nco-operated with them. To prove that a man does not hate one of his\r\nneighbors, it is only necessary to show that he loves another; to make\r\nit appear that he does not treat contemptuously the ignorant, he has\r\nonly to show that he bows respectfully to the learned; to demonstrate\r\nthat he does not disdain his inferiors, lord it over his dependents,\r\nand grind the faces of the poor, he need only show that he is polite\r\nto the rich, pays deference to titles and office, and fawns for favor\r\nupon those above him! The fact that a man always smiles on his\r\ncustomers, proves that he never scowls at those who dun him! and since\r\nhe has always a melodious \"good morning!\" for \"gentlemen of property\r\nand standing,\" it is certain that he never snarls at beggars. He who\r\nis quick to make room for a doctor of divinity, will, of course, see\r\nto it that he never runs against a porter; and he who clears the way\r\nfor a lady, will be sure never to rub against a market woman, or\r\njostle an apple-seller's board. If accused of beating down his\r\nlaundress to the lowest fraction, of making his boot-black call a\r\ndozen times for his pay, of higgling and screwing a fish boy till he\r\ntakes off two cents, or of threatening to discharge his seamstress\r\nunless she will work for a shilling a day, how easy to brand it all as\r\nslander, by showing that he pays his minister in advance, is generous\r\nin Christmas presents, gives a splendid new-year's party, expends\r\nhundreds on elections, and puts his name with a round sum on the\r\nsubscription paper of the missionary society.\r\n\r\nWho can forget the hospitality of King Herod, that model of generosity\r\n\"beyond all ancient fame,\" who offered half his kingdom to a guest, as\r\na compensation for an hour's amusement.--Could such a noble spirit\r\nhave murdered John the Baptist? Incredible! Joab too! how his soft\r\nheart was pierced at the exile of Absalom! and how his bowels yearned\r\nto restore him to his home! Of course, it is all fiction about his\r\nassassinating his nephew, Amasa, and Abner the captain of the host!\r\nSince David twice spared the life of Saul when he came to murder him,\r\nwept on the neck of Jonathan, threw himself upon the ground in anguish\r\nwhen his child sickened, and bewailed, with a broken heart, the loss\r\nof Absalom--it proves that he did not coolly plot and deliberately\r\nconsummate the murder of Uriah! As the Government of the United States\r\ngenerously gave a township of land to General La Fayette, it proves\r\nthat they have never defrauded the Indians of theirs! So the fact,\r\nthat the slaveholders of the present Congress are, to a man, favorable\r\nto recognizing the independence of Texas, with her fifty or sixty\r\nthousand inhabitants, _before she has achieved it_, and before it is\r\nrecognized by any other government, proves that these same\r\nslaveholders do _not oppose_ the recognition of Hayti, with her\r\nmillion of inhabitants, whose independence was achieved nearly half a\r\ncentury ago, and which is recognized by the most powerful governments\r\non earth!\r\n\r\nBut, seriously, no man is so slightly versed in human nature as not to\r\nknow that men habitually exercise the most opposite feelings, and\r\nindulge in the most opposite practices toward different persons or\r\ndifferent classes of persons around them. No man has ever lived who\r\nwas more celebrated for his scrupulous observance of the most exact\r\njustice, and for the illustration furnished in his life of the noblest\r\nnatural virtues, than the Roman Cato. His strict adherence to the\r\nnicest rules of equity--his integrity, honor, and incorruptible\r\nfaith--his jealous watchfulness over the rights of his fellow\r\ncitizens, and his generous devotion to their interest, procured for\r\nhim the sublime appellation of \"The Just.\" Towards _freemen_ his life\r\nwas a model of every thing just and noble: but to his slaves he was a\r\nmonster. At his meals, when the dishes were not done to his liking, or\r\nwhen his slaves were careless or inattentive in serving, he would\r\nseize a thong and violently beat them, in presence of his\r\nguests.--When they grew old or diseased, and were no longer\r\nserviceable, however long and faithfully they might have served him,\r\nhe either turned them adrift and left them to perish, or starved them\r\nto death in his own family. No facts in his history are better\r\nauthenticated than these.\r\n\r\nNo people were ever more hospitable and munificent than the Romans,\r\nand none more touched with the sufferings of others. Their public\r\ntheatres often rung with loud weeping, thousands sobbing convulsively\r\nat once over fictitious woes and imaginary sufferers: and yet these\r\nsame multitudes would shout amidst the groans of a thousand dying\r\ngladiators, forced by their conquerors to kill each other in the\r\namphitheatre for the _amusement_ of the public.[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Dr. Leland, in his \"Necessity of a Divine Revelation,\"\r\nthus describes the prevalence of these shows among the Romans:--\"They\r\nwere exhibited at the funerals of great and rich men, and on many\r\nother occasions, by the Roman consuls, praetors, aediles, senators,\r\nknights, priests, and almost all that bore great offices in the state,\r\nas well as by the emperors; and in general, by all that had a mind to\r\nmake an interest with the people, who were extravagantly fond of those\r\nkinds of shows. Not only the men, but the women, ran eagerly after\r\nthem; who were, by the prevalence of custom, so far divested of that\r\ncompassion and softness which is natural to the sex, that they took a\r\npleasure in seeing them kill one another, and only desired that they\r\nshould fall genteelly, and in an agreeable attitude. Such was the\r\nfrequency of those shows, and so great the number of men that were\r\nkilled on those occasions, that Lipsius says, no war caused such\r\nslaughter of mankind, as did these sports of pleasure, throughout the\r\nseveral provinces of the vast Roman empire.\"--_Leland's Neces. of Div.\r\nRev._ vol. ii. p. 51.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander, the tyrant of Phaeres, sobbed like a child over the\r\nmisfortunes of the Trojan queens, when the tragedy of Andromache and\r\nHecuba was played before him; yet he used to murder his subjects every\r\nday for no crime, and without even setting up the pretence of any, but\r\nmerely _to make himself sport_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that slaveholders may be full of benevolence and kindness\r\ntoward their equals and toward whites generally, even so much so as to\r\nattract the esteem and admiration of all, while they treat with the\r\nmost inhuman neglect their own slaves, is well illustrated by a\r\ncircumstance mentioned by the Rev. Dr. CHANNING, of Boston, (who once\r\nlived in Virginia,) is his work on slavery, p. 162, 1st edition:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" says the doctor, \"forget my feelings on visiting a\r\nhospital belonging to the plantation of a gentleman _highly esteemed\r\nfor his virtues_, and whose manners and conversation expressed much\r\n_benevolence_ and _conscientiousness_. When I entered with him the\r\nhospital, the first object on which my eye fell was a young woman very\r\nill, probably approaching death. She was stretched on the floor. Her\r\nhead rested on something like a pillow, but her body and limbs were\r\nextended on the hard boards. The owner, I doubt not, had, at least, as\r\nmuch kindness as myself; but he was so used to see the slaves living\r\nwithout common comforts, that the idea of unkindness in the present\r\ninstance did not enter his mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE A. AVERY, an elder of a Presbyterian church in Rochester,\r\nN.Y. who resided some years in Virginia, says:--\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion I was crossing the plantation and approaching the\r\nhouse of a friend, when I met him, _rifle in hand_, in pursuit of one\r\nof his negroes, declaring he would shoot him in a moment if he got his\r\neye upon him. It appeared that the slave had refused to be flogged,\r\nand ran off to avoid the consequences; _and yet the generous\r\nhospitality of this man to myself, and white friends generally,\r\nscarcely knew any bounds._\r\n\r\n\"There were amongst my slaveholding friends and acquaintances, persons\r\nwho were as _humane_ and _conscientious_ as men can be, and persist in\r\nthe impious claim of _property_ in a fellow being. Still I can\r\nrecollect but _one instance_ of corporal punishment, whether the\r\nsubject were male or female, in which the infliction was not on the\r\n_bare back_ with the _raw hide_, or a similar instrument, the subject\r\nbeing _tied_ during the operation to a post or tree. The _exception_\r\nwas under the following circumstances. I had taken a walk with a\r\nfriend on his plantation, and approaching his gang of slaves, I sat\r\ndown whilst he proceeded to the spot where they were at work; and\r\naddressing himself somewhat earnestly to a female who was wielding the\r\nhoe, in a moment caught up what I supposed a _tobacco stick_, (a stick\r\nsome three feet in length on which the tobacco, when out, is suspended\r\nto dry.) about the size of a _man's wrist_, and laid on a number of\r\nblows furiously over her head. The woman crouched, and seemed stunned\r\nwith the blows, but presently recommenced the motion of her hoe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. DAVID NELSON, a native of Tennessee, and late president of Marion\r\nCollege, Missouri, in a lecture at Northampton, Mass. in January,\r\n1839, made the following statement:--\r\n\r\n\"I remember a young lady who played well on the piano, and was very\r\nready to weep over any fictitious tale of suffering. I was present\r\nwhen one of her slaves lay on the floor in a high fever, and we feared\r\nshe might not recover. I saw that young lady _stamp upon her with her\r\nfeet;_ and the only remark her mother made was, 'I am afraid Evelina\r\nis too _much_ prejudiced against poor Mary.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral WILLIAM EATON, for some years U.S. Consul at Tunis, and\r\ncommander of the expedition against Tripoli, in 1895, thus gives vent\r\nto his feelings at the sight of many hundreds of Sardinians who had\r\nbeen enslaved by the Tunisians:\r\n\r\n\"Many have died of grief, and the others linger out a life less\r\ntolerable than death. Alas! remorse seizes my whole soul when I\r\nreflect, that this is indeed but a copy of the very barbarity which\r\n_my eyes have seen_ in my own native country. _How frequently_, in the\r\nsouthern states of my own country, have I seen _weeping mothers_\r\nleading the guiltless infant to the sales with as _deep anguish_ as if\r\nthey led them to the slaughter; and _yet felt my bosom tranquil_ in\r\nthe view of these aggressions on defenceless humanity. But when I see\r\nthe same enormities practised upon beings whose complexions and blood\r\nclaim kindred with my own, _I curse the perpetrators, and weep over\r\nthe wretched victims of their rapacity._ Indeed, truth and justice\r\ndemand from me the confession, that the Christian slaves among the\r\nbarbarians of Africa are treated with more humanity than the African\r\nslaves among professing Christians of civilized America; and yet\r\n_here_ [in Tunis] sensibility _bleeds at every pore_ for the wretches\r\nwhom fate has doomed to slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. H. LYMAN, late pastor of the free Presbyterian Church, Buffalo,\r\nN.Y. who spent the winter of 1832-3 at the south, says:--\r\n\r\n\"In the interior of Mississippi I was invited to the house of a\r\nplanter, where I was received with great cordiality, and entertained\r\nwith marked hospitality.\r\n\r\n\"There I saw a master in the midst of his household slaves. The\r\nevening passed most pleasantly, as indeed it must, where assiduous\r\nhospitalities are exercised towards the guest.\r\n\r\n\"Late in the morning, when I had gained the tardy consent of my host\r\nto go on my way, as a final act of kindness, he called a slave to show\r\nme across the fields by a nearer route to the main road. 'David,' said\r\nhe, 'go and show this gentleman as far as the post-office. Do you know\r\nthe big bay tree?' 'Yes, sir.' 'Do you know where the cotton mill is?'\r\n'Yes, sir.' 'Where Squire Malcolm's old field is?' 'Y--e--s, sir,'\r\nsaid David, (beginning to be bewildered). 'Do you know where Squire\r\nMalcolm's cotton field is?' 'No, sir.' 'No, sir,' said the enraged\r\nmaster, _levelling his gun at him_. 'What do you stand here, saying,\r\nYes, yes, yes, for, when you don't know?' All this was accompanied\r\nwith _threats_ and _imprecations_, and a manner that contrasted\r\nstrangely with the _religious conversation and gentle manners_ of the\r\nprevious evening.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. JAMES H. DICKEY, formerly a slaveholder in South Carolina,\r\nnow pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Hennepin, Ill. in his \"Review\r\nof Nevins' Biblical Antiquities,\" after asserting that slaveholding\r\ntends to beget \"a spirit of cruelty and tyranny, and to destroy every\r\ngenerous and noble feeling,\" (page 33,) he adds the following as a\r\nnote:--\r\n\r\n\"It may be that this will be considered censorious, and the proverbial\r\ngenerosity and hospitality of the south will be appealed to as a full\r\nconfutation of it. The writer thinks he can appreciate southern\r\nkindness and hospitality. Having been born in Virginia, raised and\r\neducated in South Carolina and Kentucky, he is altogether southern in\r\nhis feelings, and habits, and modes of familiar conversation. He can\r\nsay of the south as Cowper said of England, 'With all thy faults I\r\nlove thee still, my country.' And nothing but the abominations of\r\nslavery could have induced him willingly to forsake a land endeared to\r\nhim by all the associations of childhood and youth.\r\n\r\n\"Yet it is candid to admit that it is not all gold that glitters.\r\nThere is a fictitious kindness and hospitality. The famous Robin Hood\r\nwas kind and generous--no man more hospitable--he robbed the rich to\r\nsupply the necessities of the poor. Others rob the poor to bestow\r\ngifts and lavish kindness and hospitality on their rich friends and\r\nneighbors. It is an easy matter for a man to appear kind and generous,\r\nwhen he bestows that which others have earned.\r\n\r\n\"I said, there is a fictitious kindness and hospitality. I once knew a\r\nman who left his wife and children three days, without fire-wood,\r\nwithout bread-stuff and without shoes, while the ground was covered\r\nwith snow--that he might indulge in his cups. And when I attempted to\r\nexpostulate with him, he took the subject out of my hands, and\r\nexpatiating on the evils of intemperance more eloquently than I could,\r\nconcluded by warning me, _with tears_, to avoid the snares of the\r\nlatter. He had tender feelings, yet a hard heart. I once knew a young\r\nlady of polished manners and accomplished education, who would weep\r\nwith sympathy over the fictitious woes exhibited in a novel. And\r\nwaking from her reverie of grief, while her eye was yet wet with\r\ntears, would call her little waiter, and if she did not appear at the\r\nfirst call, would rap her head with her thimble till my head ached.\r\n\r\n\"I knew a man who was famed for kindly sympathies. He once took off\r\nhis shirt and gave it to a poor white man. The same man hired a black\r\nman, and gave him for his _daily task_, through the winter, to feed\r\nthe beasts, keep fires, and make one hundred rails: and in case of\r\nfailure the lash was applied so freely, that, in the spring, his back\r\nwas _one continued sore, from his shoulders to his waist_. Yet this\r\nman was a professor of religion, and famous for his tender sympathies\r\nto white men!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION IV.--'NORTHERN VISITORS AT THE SOUTH TESTIFY THAT THE SLAVES\r\nARE NOT CRUELLY TREATED.'\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER:--Their knowledge on this point must have been derived, either\r\nfrom the slaveholders and overseers themselves, or from the slaves, or\r\nfrom their own observation. If from the slaveholders, _their_\r\ntestimony has already been weighed and found wanting; if they derived\r\nit from the slaves, they can hardly be so simple as to suppose that\r\nthe _guest, associate and friend of the master_, would be likely to\r\ndraw from his _slaves_ any other testimony respecting his treatment of\r\nthem, than such as would please _him_. The great shrewdness and tact\r\nexhibited by slaves in _keeping themselves out of difficulty_, when\r\nclose questioned by strangers as to their treatment, cannot fail to\r\nstrike every accurate observer. The following remarks of CHIEF JUSTICE\r\nHENDERSON, a North Carolina slaveholder, in his decision (in 1830,) in\r\nthe case of the State _versus_ Charity, 2 Devereaux's North Carolina\r\nReports, 513, illustrate the folly of arguing the good treatment of\r\nslaves from their own declarations, _while in the power of their\r\nmasters_. In the case above cited, the Chief Justice, in refusing to\r\npermit a master to give in evidence, declarations made to him by his\r\nslave, says of masters and slaves generally--\r\n\r\n\"The master has an almost _absolute control_ over the body and _mind_\r\nof his slave. The master's _will_ is the slave's _will_. All his acts,\r\n_all his sayings_, are made with a view to propitiate his master. His\r\nconfessions are made, not from a love of truth, not from a sense of\r\nduty, not to speak a falsehood, but to _please his master_--and it is\r\nin vain that his master tells him to speak the truth and conceals from\r\nhim how he wishes the question answered. The slave _will_ ascertain,\r\nor, which is the same thing, think that he has ascertained _the wishes\r\nof his master,_ and MOULD HIS ANSWER ACCORDINGLY. We therefore more\r\noften get the wishes of the master, or the slave's belief of his\r\nwishes, than the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract of a letter from the Hon. SETH M. GATES, member\r\nelect of the next Congress, furnishes a clue by which to interpret the\r\nlooks, actions, and protestations of slaves, when in the presence of\r\ntheir masters' guests, and the pains sometimes taken by slaveholders,\r\nin teaching their slaves the art of _pretending_ that they are treated\r\nwell, love their masters, are happy, &c. The letter is dated Leroy,\r\nJan. 4, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent your letter to Rev. Joseph M. Sadd, Castile, Genesee\r\ncounty, who resided five years in a slave state, and left, disgusted\r\nwith slavery. I trust he will give you some facts. I remember one\r\nfact, which his wife witnessed. A relative, where she boarded,\r\nreturning to his plantation after a temporary absence, was not met by\r\nhis servants with such demonstrations of joy as was their wont. He\r\nordered his horse put out, took down his whip, ordered his servants to\r\nthe barn, and gave them a most cruel beating, because they did not run\r\nout to meet him, and pretend great attachment to him. Mrs. Sadd had\r\noverheard the servants agreeing not to go out, before his return, as\r\nthey said _they did not love him_--and this led her to watch his\r\nconduct to them. This man was a professor of religion!\"\r\n\r\nIf these northern visitors derived their information that the slaves\r\nare _not_ cruelly treated from _their own observation_, it amounts to\r\nthis, _they did not see_ cruelties inflicted on the slaves. To which\r\nwe reply, that the preceding pages contain testimony from hundreds of\r\nwitnesses, who testify that they _did see_ the cruelties whereof they\r\naffirm. Besides this, they contain the solemn declarations of scores\r\nof slaveholders themselves, in all parts of the slave states, that the\r\nslaves are cruelly treated. These declarations are moreover fully\r\ncorroborated, by the laws of slave states, by a multitude of\r\nadvertisements in their newspapers, describing runaway slaves, by\r\ntheir scars, brands, gashes, maimings, cropped ears, iron collars,\r\nchains, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nTruly, after the foregoing array of facts and testimony, and after the\r\nobjectors' forces have one after another filed off before them, now to\r\nmarch up a phalanx of northern _visitors_, is to beat a retreat.\r\n'Visitors!' What insight do casual visitors get into the tempers and\r\ndaily practices of those whom they visit, or of the treatment that\r\ntheir slaves receive at their hands, especially if these visitors are\r\nstrangers, and from a region where there are no slaves, and which\r\nclaims to be opposed to slavery? What opportunity has a stranger, and\r\na temporary guest, to learn the every-day habits and caprices of his\r\nhost? Oh, these northern visitors tell us they have visited scores of\r\nfamilies at the south and never saw a master or mistress whip their\r\nslaves. Indeed! They have, doubtless, visited hundreds of families at\r\nthe north--did they ever see, on such occasions, the father or mother\r\nwhip their children? If so, they must associate with very ill-bred\r\npersons. Because well-bred parents do not whip their children in the\r\npresence, or within the hearing of their guests are we to infer that\r\nthey never do it _out_ of their sight and hearing? But perhaps the\r\nfact that these visitors do not _remember_ seeing slaveholders strike\r\ntheir slaves, merely proves, that they had so little feeling for them,\r\nthat though they might be struck every day in their presence, yet as\r\nthey were only slaves and 'niggers,' it produced no effect upon them;\r\nconsequently they have no impressions to recall. These visitors have\r\nalso doubtless _rode_ with scores of slaveholders. Are they quite\r\ncertain they ever saw them whip their _horses_? and can they recall\r\nthe persons, times, places, and circumstances? But even if these\r\nvisitors regarded the slaves with some kind feelings, when they first\r\nwent to the south, yet being constantly with their oppressors, seeing\r\nthem used as articles of property, accustomed to hear them charged\r\nwith all kinds of misdemeanors, their ears filled with complaints of\r\ntheir laziness, carelessness, insolence, obstinacy, stupidity, thefts,\r\nelopements, &c. and at the same time, receiving themselves the most\r\ngratifying attentions and caresses from the same persons, who, while\r\nthey make to them these representations of their slaves, are giving\r\nthem airings in their coaches, making parties for them, taking them on\r\nexcursions of pleasure, lavishing upon them their choicest\r\nhospitalities, and urging them to protract indefinitely their\r\nstay--what more natural than for the flattered guest to admire such\r\nhospitable people, catch their spirit, and fully sympathize with their\r\nfeelings toward their slaves, regarding with increased disgust and\r\naversion those who can habitually tease and worry such loveliness and\r\ngenerosity[23]. After the visitor had been in contact with the\r\nslave-holding spirit long enough to have imbibed it, (no very tedious\r\nprocess,) a cuff, or even a kick administered to a slave, would not be\r\nlikely to give him such a shock that his memory would long retain the\r\ntraces of it. But lest we do these visitors injustice, we will suppose\r\nthat they carried with them to the south humane feelings for the\r\nslave, and that those feelings remained unblunted; still, what\r\nopportunity could they have to witness the actual condition of the\r\nslaves? They come in contact with the house-servants only, and as a\r\ngeneral thing, with none but the select ones of these, the\r\n_parlor_-servants; who generally differ as widely in their appearance\r\nand treatment from the cooks and scullions in the kitchen, as parlor\r\nfurniture does from the kitchen utensils. Certain servants are\r\nassigned to the parlor, just as certain articles of furniture are\r\nselected for it, _to be seen_--and it is no less ridiculous to infer\r\nthat the kitchen scullions are clothed and treated like those servants\r\nwho wait at the table, and are in the presence of guests, than to\r\ninfer that the kitchen is set out with sofas, ottomans, piano-fortes,\r\nand full-length mirrors, because the parlor is. But the house-slaves\r\nare only a fraction of the whole number. The _field-hands_ constitute\r\nthe great mass of the slaves, and these the visitors rarely get a\r\nglimpse at. They are away at their work by day-break, and do not\r\nreturn to their huts till dark. Their huts are commonly at some\r\ndistance from the master's mansion, and the fields in which they\r\nlabor, generally much farther, and out of sight. If the visitor\r\ntraverses the plantation, care is taken that he does not go alone; if\r\nhe expresses a wish to see it, the horses are saddled, and the master\r\nor his son gallops the rounds with him; if he expresses a desire to\r\nsee the slaves at work, his conductor will know _where_ to take him,\r\nand _when_, and _which_ of them to show; the overseer, too, knows\r\nquite too well the part he has to act on such occasions, to shock the\r\nuninitiated ears of the visitors with the shrieks of his victims. It\r\nis manifest that visitors can see only the least repulsive parts of\r\nslavery, inasmuch as it is wholly at the option of the master, what\r\nparts to show them; as a matter of necessity, he can see only the\r\n_outside_--and that, like the outside of doorknobs and andirons is\r\nfurbished up to be _looked at_. So long as it is human nature to wear\r\n_the best side out_, so long the northern guests of southern\r\nslaveholders will see next to nothing of the reality of slavery. Those\r\nvisitors may still keep up their autumnal migrations to the slave\r\nstates, and, after a hasty survey of the tinsel hung before the\r\ncurtain of slavery, without a single glance behind it, and at the\r\npaint and varnish that _cover up_ dead men's bones, and while those\r\nwho have hoaxed them with their smooth stories and white-washed\r\nspecimens of slavery, are tittering at their gullibility, they return\r\nin the spring on the same fool's-errand with their predecessors,\r\nretailing their lesson, and mouthing the praises of the masters, and\r\nthe comforts of the slaves. They now become village umpires in all\r\ndisputes about the condition of the slaves, and each thence forward\r\nends all controversies with his oracular, \"I've _seen_, and sure I\r\nought to know.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Well saith the Scripture, \"A gift blindeth the eyes.\" The\r\nslaves understand this, though the guest may not; they know very well\r\nthat they have no sympathy to expect from their master's guests; that\r\nthe good cheer of the \"big house,\" and the attentions shown them, will\r\ngenerally commit them in their master's favor, and against themselves.\r\nMessrs. Thome and Kimball, in their late work, state the following\r\nfact, in illustration of this feeling among the negro apprentices in\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\n\"The governor of one of the islands, shortly after his arrival, dined\r\nwith one of the wealthiest proprietors. The next day one of the\r\nnegroes of the estate said to another, \"De new gubner been\r\n_poison'd_.\" \"What dat you say?\" inquired the other in astonishment,\r\n\"De gubner been _poison'd_! Dah, now!--How him poisoned?\" \"_Him eat\r\nmassa's turtle soup last night_,\" said the shrewd negro. The other\r\ntook his meaning at once; and his sympathy for the governor was\r\nturned into concern for himself, when he perceived that the\r\npoison was one from which he was likely to suffer more than his\r\nexcellency.\"--_Emancipation in the West Indies_, p. 334.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut all northern visitors at the south are not thus easily gulled.\r\nMany of them, as the preceding pages show, have too much sense to be\r\ncaught with chaff.\r\n\r\nWe may add here, that those classes of visitors whose representations\r\nof the treatment of slaves are most influential in moulding the\r\nopinions of the free states, are ministers of the gospel, agents of\r\nbenevolent societies, and teachers who have traveled and temporarily\r\nresided in the slave states--classes of persons less likely than any\r\nothers to witness cruelties, because slaveholders generally take more\r\npains to keep such visitors in ignorance than others, because their\r\nvocations would furnish them fewer opportunities for witnessing them,\r\nand because they come in contact with a class of society in which\r\nfewer atrocities are committed than in any other, and that too, under\r\ncircumstances which make it almost impossible for them to witness\r\nthose which are actually committed.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous classes of persons from the north who temporarily\r\nreside in the slave states, the mechanics who find employment on the\r\n_plantations_, are the only persons who are in circumstances to look\r\n\"behind the scenes.\" Merchants, pedlars, venders of patents, drovers,\r\nspeculators, and almost all descriptions of persons who go from the\r\nfree states to the south to make money see little of slavery, except\r\n_upon the road_, at public inns, and in villages and cities.\r\n\r\nLet not the reader infer from what has been said, that the\r\n_parlor_-slaves, chamber-maids, &c. in the slave states are not\r\ntreated with cruelty--far from it. They often experience terrible\r\ninflictions; not generally so terrible or so frequent as the\r\nfield-hands, and very rarely in the presence of guests[24]\r\nHouse-slaves are for the most part treated far better than\r\nplantation-slaves, and those under the immediate direction of the\r\nmaster and mistress, than those under overseers and drivers. It is\r\nquite worthy of remark, that of the thousands of northern men who have\r\nvisited the south, and are always lauding the kindness of slaveholders\r\nand the comfort of the slaves, protesting that they have never seen\r\ncruelties inflicted on them, &c. each perhaps, without exception, has\r\nsome story to tell which reveals, better perhaps than the most\r\nbarbarous butchery could do, a public sentiment toward slaves, showing\r\nthat the most cruel inflictions must of necessity be the constant\r\nportion of the slaves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Rev. JOSEPH M. SADD, a Presbyterian clergyman, in\r\nCastile, Genesee county, N.Y. recently from Missouri, where he has\r\npreached five years, in the midst of slaveholders, says, in a letter\r\njust received, speaking of the pains taken by slaveholders to conceal\r\nfrom the eyes of strangers and visitors, the cruelties which they\r\ninflict upon their slaves--\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to be an eye-witness of these things; the master and\r\nmistress, almost invariably punish their slaves only in the presence\r\nof themselves and other slaves.\"]\r\n\r\nThough facts of this kind lie thick in every corner, the reader will,\r\nwe are sure, tolerate even a needless illustration, if told that it is\r\nfrom the pen of N.P. Rogers, Esq. of Concord, N.H. who, whatever he\r\nwrites, though it be, as in this case, a mere hasty letter, always\r\nfinds readers to the end.\r\n\r\n\"At a court session at Guilford, Stafford county, N.H. in August,\r\n1837, the Hon. Daniel M. Durell, of Dover, formerly Chief Justice\r\nof the Common Pleas for that state, and a member of Congress,\r\nwas charging the abolitionists, in presence of several gentlemen\r\nof the bar, at their boarding house, with exaggerations and\r\nmisrepresentations of slave treatment at the south. 'One instance\r\nin particular,' he witnessed, he said, where he 'knew they\r\nmisrepresented. It was in the Congregational meeting house at Dover.\r\nHe was passing by, and saw a crowd entering and about the door; and on\r\ninquiry, found that _abolition was going on in there_. He stood in the\r\nentry for a moment, and found the Englishman, Thompson, was holding\r\nforth. The fellow was speaking of the treatment of slaves; and he said\r\nit was no uncommon thing for masters, when exasperated with the slave,\r\nto hang him up by the two thumbs, and flog him. I knew the fellow lied\r\nthere,' said the judge, 'for I had traveled through the south, from\r\nGeorgia north, and I never saw a single instance of the kind. The\r\nfellow said it was a common thing.' 'Did you see any _exasperated\r\nmasters_, Judge,' said I, 'in your journey?' 'No sir,' said he, 'not\r\nan individual instance.' 'You hardly are able to convict Mr. Thompson\r\nof falsehood, then, Judge,' said I, 'if I understood you right. He\r\nspoke, as I understood you, of _exasperated masters_--and you say you\r\ndid not see any. Mr. Thompson did not say it was common for masters in\r\ngood humor to hang up their slaves.' The Judge did not perceive the\r\nmateriality of the distinction. 'Oh, they misrepresent and lie about\r\nthis treatment of the niggers,' he continued. 'In going through all\r\nthe states I visited, I do not now remember a single instance of cruel\r\ntreatment. Indeed, I remember of seeing but one nigger struck, during\r\nmy whole journey. There was one instance. We were riding in the stage,\r\npretty early one morning, and we met a black fellow, driving a span of\r\nhorses, and a load (I think he said) of hay. The fellow turned out\r\nbefore we got to him, clean down into the ditch, as far as he could\r\nget. He knew, you see, what to depend on, if he did not give the road.\r\nOur driver, as we passed the fellow, fetched him a smart crack with\r\nhis whip across the chops. He did not make any noise, though I guess\r\nit hurt him some--he grinned.--Oh, no! these fellows exaggerate. The\r\nniggers, as a general thing, are kindly treated. There may be\r\nexceptions, but I saw nothing of it.' (By the way, the Judge did not\r\nknow there were any abolitionists present.) 'What did you _do_ to the\r\ndriver, Judge,' said I, 'for striking that man?' 'Do,' said he, 'I did\r\nnothing to him, to be sure.' 'What did you _say_ to him, sir?' said I.\r\n'Nothing,' he replied: 'I said nothing to him.' 'What did the other\r\npassengers do?' said I. 'Nothing, sir,' said the Judge. 'The fellow\r\nturned out the white of his eye, but he did not make any noise.' 'Did\r\nthe driver say any thing, Judge, when he struck the man?' 'Nothing,'\r\nsaid the Judge, 'only he _damned him_, and told him he'd learn him to\r\nkeep out of the reach of his whip.' 'Sir,' said I, 'if George Thompson\r\nhad told this story, in the warmth of an anti-slavery speech, I should\r\nscarcely have credited it. I have attended many anti-slavery meetings,\r\nand I never heard an instance of such _cold-blooded, wanton,\r\ninsolent_, DIABOLICAL cruelty as this; and, sir, if I live to attend\r\nanother meeting, I shall relate this, and give Judge Durell's name as\r\nthe witness of it.' An infliction of the most insolent character,\r\nentirely unprovoked, on a perfect stranger, who had showed the utmost\r\ncivility, in giving all the road, and only could not get beyond the\r\nlong reach of the driver's whip--and he a stage driver, a class\r\n_generous_ next to the sailor, in the sober hour of morning--and\r\n_borne in silence_--and _told to show that the colored man of the\r\nsouth was kindly treated_--all evincing, to an unutterable extent,\r\nthat the temper of the south toward the slave is merciless, even to\r\n_diabolism_--and that the north regards him with, if possible, a more\r\nfiendish indifference still!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems but an act of simple justice to say, in conclusion, that many\r\nof the slaveholders from whom our northern visitors derive their\r\ninformation of the \"good treatment\" of the slave, may not design to\r\ndeceive them. Such visitors are often, perhaps generally brought in\r\ncontact with the better class of slaveholders, whose slaves are really\r\nbetter fed, clothed, lodged, and housed; more moderately worked; more\r\nseldom whipped, and with less severity, than the slaves generally.\r\nThose masters in speaking of the good condition of their slaves, and\r\nasserting that they are treated _well_, use terms that are not\r\n_absolute_ but _comparative_: and it may be, and doubtless often is\r\ntrue that their stares are treated well _as slaves_, in comparison\r\nwith the treatment received by slaves generally. So the overseers of\r\nsuch slaves, and the slaves themselves, may, without lying or\r\ndesigning to mislead, honestly give the same testimony. As the great\r\nbody of slaves within their knowledge _fare worse_, it is not strange\r\nthat, when speaking of the treatment on their own plantation, they\r\nshould call it _good_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION V.--'IT IS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE MASTERS TO TREAT THEIR\r\nSLAVES WELL.'\r\n\r\nSo it is for the interest of the drunkard to quit his cups; for the\r\nglutton to curb his appetite; for the debauchee to bridle his lust;\r\nfor the sluggard to be up betimes; for the spendthrift to be\r\neconomical, and for all sinners to stop sinning. Even if it were for\r\nthe interest of masters to treat their slaves well, he must be a\r\nnovice who thinks _that_ a proof that the slaves _are_ well treated.\r\nThe whole history of man is a record of real interests sacrificed to\r\npresent gratification. If all men's actions were consistent with their\r\nbest interests, folly and sin would be words without meaning.\r\n\r\nIf the objector means that it is for the pecuniary interests of\r\nmasters to treat their slaves well, and thence infers their good\r\ntreatment, we reply, that though the love of money is strong, yet\r\nappetite and lust, pride, anger and revenge, the love of power and\r\nhonor, are each an overmatch for it; and when either of them is roused\r\nby a sudden stimulant, the love of money worsted in the grapple with\r\nit. Look at the hourly lavish outlays of money to procure a momentary\r\ngratification for those passions and appetites. As the desire for\r\nmoney is, in the main, merely a desire for the means of gratifying\r\n_other_ desires, or rather for one of the means, it must be the\r\n_servant_ not the sovereign of those desires, to whose gratification\r\nits only use is to minister. But even if the love of money were the\r\nstrongest human passion, who is simple enough to believe that it is\r\nall the time so powerfully excited, that no other passion or appetite\r\ncan get the mastery over it?  Who does not know that gusts of rage,\r\nrevenge, jealousy and lust drive it before them as a tempest tosses a\r\nfeather?\r\n\r\nThe objector has forgotten his first lessons; they taught him that it\r\nis human nature to gratify the _uppermost_ passion: and is _prudence_\r\nthe uppermost passion with slaveholders, and self-restraint their\r\ngreat characteristic? The strongest feeling of any moment is the\r\nsovereign of that moment, and rules. Is a propensity to practice\r\n_economy_ the predominant feeling with slaveholders? Ridiculous!\r\nEvery northerner knows that slaveholders are proverbial for lavish\r\nexpenditures, never higgling about the _price_ of a gratification.\r\nHuman passions have not, like the tides, regular ebbs and flows, with\r\ntheir stationary, high and low water marks. They are a dominion\r\nconvulsed with revolutions; coronations and dethronements in ceasless\r\nsuccession--each ruler a usurper and a despot. Love of money gets a\r\nsnatch at the sceptre as well as the rest, not by hereditary right,\r\nbut because, in the fluctuations of human feelings, a chance wave\r\nwashes him up to the throne, and the next perhaps washes him off\r\nwithout time to nominate his successor. Since, then, as a matter of\r\nfact, a host of appetites and passions do hourly get the better of\r\nlove of money, what protection does the slave find in his master's\r\n_interest_, against the sweep of his passions and appetites? Besides,\r\na master can inflict upon his slave horrible cruelties without\r\nperceptibly injuring his health, or taking time from his labor, or\r\nlessening his value as property. Blows with a small stick give more\r\nacute pain, than with a large one. A club bruises, and benumbs the\r\nnerves, while a switch, neither breaking nor bruising the flesh,\r\ninstead of blunting the sense of feeling, wakes up and stings to\r\ntorture all the susceptibilities of pain. By this kind of infliction,\r\nmore actual cruelty can be perpetrated in the giving of pain at the\r\ninstant, than by the most horrible bruisings and lacerations; and\r\nthat, too, with little comparative hazard to the slave's health, or to\r\nhis value as property, and without loss of time from labor. Even\r\ngiving to the objection all the force claimed for it, what protection\r\nis it to the slave? It _professes_ to shield the slave from such\r\ntreatment alone, as would either lay him aside from labor, or injure\r\nhis health, and thus lessen his value as a working animal, making him\r\na _damaged article_ in the market. Now, is nothing _bad treatment_ of\r\na human being except that which produces these effects? Does the fact\r\nthat a man's constitution is not actually shattered, and his life\r\nshortened by his treatment, prove that he is treated well? Is no\r\ntreatment cruel except what sprains muscles, or cuts sinews, or bursts\r\nblood vessels, or breaks bones, and thus lessens a man's value as a\r\nworking animal?\r\n\r\nA slave may get blows and kicks every hour in the day, without having\r\nhis constitution broken, or without suffering sensibly in his health,\r\nor flesh, or appetite, or power to labor. Therefore, beaten and kicked\r\nas he is, he must be treated _well_, according to the objector, since\r\nthe master's _interest_ does not suffer thereby.\r\n\r\nFinally, the objector virtually maintains that all possible privations\r\nand inflictions suffered by slaves, that do not actually cripple their\r\npower to labor, and make them 'damaged merchandize,' are to be set\r\ndown as 'good treatment,' and that nothing is _bad_ treatment except\r\nwhat produces these effects.\r\n\r\nThus we see that even if the slave were effectually shielded from all\r\nthose inflictions, which, by lessening his value as property, would\r\ninjure the interests of his master, he would still nave no protection\r\nagainst numberless and terrible cruelties. But we go further, and\r\nmaintain that in respect to large classes of slaves, it is for the\r\n_interest_ of their masters to treat them with barbarous inhumanity.\r\n\r\n1. _Old slaves._ It would be for the interest of the masters to\r\nshorten their days.\r\n\r\n2. _Worn out slaves._ Multitudes of slaves by being overworked, have\r\ntheir constitutions broken in middle life. It would be _economical_\r\nfor masters to starve or flog such to death.\r\n\r\n3. _The incurably diseased and maimed._ In all such cases it would be\r\n_cheaper_ for masters to buy poison than medicine.\r\n\r\n4. _The blind, lunatics, and idiots_. As all such would be a tax on\r\nhim, it would be for his interest to shorten their days.\r\n\r\n5. _The deaf and dumb, and persons greatly deformed._ Such might or\r\nmight not be serviceable to him; many of them at least would be a\r\nburden, and few men carry burdens when they can throw them off.\r\n\r\n6. _Feeble infants._ As such would require much nursing, the time,\r\ntrouble and expense necessary to raise them, would generally be more\r\nthan they would be worth as _working animals_. How many such infants\r\nwould be likely to be 'raised,' from _disinterested_ benevolence? To\r\nthis it may be added that in the far south and south west, it is\r\nnotoriously for the interest of the master not to 'raise' slaves at\r\nall. To buy slaves when nearly grown, from the northern slave states,\r\nwould be _cheaper_ than to raise them. This is shown in the fact, that\r\nmothers with infants sell for less in those states than those without\r\nthem. And when slave-traders purchase such in the upper country, it is\r\nnotorious that they not unfrequently either sell their infants, or\r\ngive them away. Therefore it would be for the _interest_ of the\r\nmasters, throughout that region, to have all the new-born children\r\nleft to perish. It would also be for their interest to make such\r\narrangements as effectually to separate the sexes, or if that were not\r\ndone, so to overwork the females as to prevent childbearing.\r\n\r\n7. _Incorrigible slaves_. On most of the large plantations, there are,\r\nmore or less, incorrigible slaves,--that is, slaves who _will not_ be\r\nprofitable to their masters--and from whom torture can extort little\r\nbut defiance.[25] These are frequently slaves of uncommon minds, who\r\nfeel so keenly the wrongs of slavery that their proud spirits spurn\r\ntheir chains and defy their tormentors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Advertisements like the following are not unfrequent in\r\nthe southern papers.\r\n\r\n_From the Elizabeth (N.C.) Phenix, Jan. 5, 1839._ \"The subscriber\r\noffers for sale his blacksmith NAT, 28 years of age, and _remarkably\r\nlarge and likely_. The only cause of my selling him is I CANNOT\r\nCONTROL HIM. _Hertford, Dec.5, 1838._ J. GORDON.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have commonly great sway over the other slaves, their example is\r\ncontagious, and their influence subversive of 'plantation discipline.'\r\nConsequently they must be made a warning to others. It is for the\r\n_interest_ of the masters (at least they believe it to be) to put upon\r\nsuch slaves iron collars and chains, to brand and crop them; to\r\ndisfigure, lacerate, starve and torture them--in a word, to inflict\r\nupon them such vengeance as shall strike terror into the other slaves.\r\nTo this class may be added the incorrigibly thievish and indolent; it\r\nwould be for the interest of the masters to treat them with such\r\nseverity as would deter others from following their example.\r\n\r\n7. _Runaways._ When a slave has once runaway from his master and is\r\ncaught, he is thenceforward treated with severity. It is for the\r\ninterest of the master to make an example of him, by the greatest\r\nprivations and inflictions.\r\n\r\n8. _Hired slaves._ It is for the interest of those who hire slaves to\r\nget as much out of them as they can; the temptation to overwork them\r\nis powerful. If it be said that the master could, in that case,\r\nrecover damages, the answer is, that damages would not be recoverable\r\nin law unless actual injury--enough to impair the power of the slave\r\nto labor, be _proved._ And this ordinarily would be impossible, unless\r\nthe slave has been worked so greatly beyond his strength as to produce\r\nsome fatal derangement of the vital functions. Indeed, as all who are\r\nfamiliar with such cases in southern courts well know, the proof of\r\nactual injury to the slave, so as to lessen his value, is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to make out, and every hirer of slaves can overwork them,\r\ngive them insufficient food, clothing, and shelter, and inflict upon\r\nthem nameless cruelties with entire impunity. We repeat then that it\r\nis for the _interest_ of the hirer to push his slaves to their utmost\r\nstrength, provided he does not drive them to such an extreme, that\r\ntheir constitutions actually give way under it, while in his hands.\r\nThe supreme court of Maryland has decided that, 'There must be _at\r\nleast a diminution of the faculty of the slave for bodily labor_ to\r\nwarrant an action by the master.'--_1 Harris and Johnson's Reports,\r\n4._\r\n\r\n9. _Slaves under overseers whose wages are proportioned to the crop\r\nwhich they raise._ This is an arrangement common in the slave states,\r\nand in its practical operation is equivalent to a bounty on _hard\r\ndriving_--a virtual premium offered to overseers to keep the slaves\r\nwhipped up to the top of their strength. Even where the overseer has a\r\nfixed salary, irrespective of the value of the crop which he takes\r\noff, he is strongly tempted to overwork the slaves, as those overseers\r\nget the highest wages who can draw the largest income from a\r\nplantation with a given number of slaves; so that we may include in\r\nthis last class of slaves, the majority of all those who are under\r\noverseers, whatever the terms on which those overseers are employed.\r\n\r\nAnother class of slaves may be mentioned; we refer to the slaves of\r\nmasters who _bet_ upon their crops. In the cotton and sugar region\r\nthere is a fearful amount of this desperate gambling, in which, though\r\nmoney is the ostensible stake and forfeit, human life is the real one.\r\nThe length to which this rivalry is carried at the south and south\r\nwest, the multitude of planters who engage in it, and the recklessness\r\nof human life exhibited in driving the murderous game to its issue,\r\ncannot well be imagined by one who has not lived in the midst of it.\r\nDesire of gain is only one of the motives that stimulates them;--the\r\n_eclat_ of having made the largest crop with a given number of hands,\r\nis also a powerful stimulant; the southern newspapers, at the crop\r\nseason, chronicle carefully the \"cotton brag,\" and the \"crack cotton\r\npicking,\" and \"unparalleled driving,\" &c. Even the editors of\r\nprofessedly religious papers, cheer on the méleé and sing the triumphs\r\nof the victor. Among these we recollect the celebrated Rev. J.N.\r\nMaffit, recently editor of a religious paper at Natchez, Miss. in\r\nwhich he took care to assign a prominent place, and capitals to \"THE\r\nCOTTON BRAG.\" The testimony of Mr. Bliss, page 38, details some of the\r\nparticulars of this _betting_ upon crops. All the preceding classes of\r\nslaves are in circumstances which make it \"for the _interest_ of their\r\nmasters,\" or those who have the management of them, to treat them\r\ncruelly.\r\n\r\nBesides the operation of the causes already specified, which make it\r\nfor the interest of masters and overseers to treat cruelly _certain\r\nclasses_ of their slaves, a variety of others exist, which make it for\r\ntheir interest to treat cruelly _the great body_ of their slaves.\r\nThese causes are, the nature of certain kinds of products, the kind of\r\nlabor required in cultivating and preparing them for market, the best\r\ntimes for such labor, the state of the market, fluctuations in prices,\r\nfacilities for transportation, the weather, seasons, &c. &c. Some of\r\nthe causes which operate to produce this are--\r\n\r\n1. _The early market_. If the planter can get his crop into market\r\nearly, he may save thousands which might be lost if it arrived later.\r\n\r\n2. _Changes in the market_. A sudden rise in the market with the\r\nprobability that it will be short, or a gradual fall with a\r\nprobability that it will be long, is a strong temptation to the master\r\nto push his slaves to the utmost, that he may in the one case make all\r\nhe can, by taking the tide at the flood, and in the other lose as\r\nlittle as may be, by taking it as early as possible in the ebb.\r\n\r\n3. _High prices_. Whenever the slave-grown staples bring a high price,\r\nas is now the case with cotton, every slaveholder is tempted to\r\noverwork his slaves. By forcing them to do double work for a few weeks\r\nor months, while the price is up, he can _afford_ to lose a number of\r\nthem and to lessen the value of all by over-driving. A cotton planter\r\nwith a hundred vigorous slaves, would have made a profitable\r\nspeculation, if, during the years '34, 5, and 6, when the average\r\nprice of cotton was 17 cents a pound, he had so overworked his slaves\r\nthat half of them died upon his hands in '37, when cotton had fallen\r\nto six and eight cents. No wonder that the poor slaves pray that cotton\r\nand sugar may be cheap. The writer has frequently heard it declared by\r\nplanters in the lower country, that, it is more profitable to drive\r\nthe slaves to such over exertion as to _use them up_, in seven or\r\neight years, than to give them only ordinary tasks and protract their\r\nlives to the ordinary period.[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The reader is referred to a variety of facts and\r\ntestimony on this point on the 39th page of this work.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Untimely seasons_. When the winter encroaches on the spring, and\r\nmakes late seed time, the first favorable weather is a temptation to\r\noverwork the slaves, too strong to be resisted by those who hold men\r\nas mere working animals. So when frosts set in early, and a great\r\namount of work is to be done in a little time, or great loss suffered.\r\nSo also after a long storm either in seed or crop time, when the\r\nweather becomes favorable, the same temptation presses, and in all\r\nthese cases the master would _save money_ by overdriving his slaves.\r\n\r\n5. _Periodical pressure of certain kinds of labor._ The manufacture of\r\nsugar is an illustration. In a work entitled \"Travels in Louisiana in\r\n1802,\" translated from the French, by John Davis, is the following\r\ntestimony under this head:--\r\n\r\n\"At the rolling of sugars, an interval of from two to three months,\r\nthey (the slaves in Louisiana,) work _both night and day_. Abridged of\r\ntheir sleep, they scarcely retire to rest during the whole period\" See\r\npage 81.\r\n\r\nIn an article on the agriculture of Louisiana, published in the second\r\nnumber of the \"Western Review,\" is the following:--\"The work is\r\nadmitted to be severe for the hands, (slaves) requiring, when the\r\nprocess of making sugar is commenced, TO BE PRESSED NIGHT AND DAY.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be for the interest of the sugar planter greatly to overwork\r\nhis slaves, during the annual process of sugar-making.\r\n\r\nThe severity of this periodical pressure, in preparing for market\r\nother staples of the slave states besides sugar, may be inferred from\r\nthe following. Mr. Hammond, of South Carolina, in his speech in\r\nCongress, Feb. 1. 1836, (See National Intelligencer) said, \"In the\r\nheat of the crop, the loss of one or two days, would inevitably ruin\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n6. _Times of scarcity_. Drought, long rain, frost, &c. are liable to\r\ncut off the corn crop, upon which the slaves are fed. If this happens\r\nwhen the staple which they raise is at a low price, it is for the\r\ninterest of the master to put the slave on short rations, thus forcing\r\nhim to suffer from hunger.\r\n\r\n7. _The raising of crops for exportation_. In all those states where\r\ncotton and sugar are raised for exportation, it is, for the most part,\r\nmore profitable to buy provisions for the slaves than to raise them.\r\nWhere this is the case the slaveholders believe it to be for their\r\ninterest to give their slaves less food, than their hunger craves, and\r\nthey do generally give them insufficient sustenance.[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Hear the testimony of a slaveholder, on this subject, a\r\nmember of Congress from Virginia, from 1817 to 1830, Hon. Alexander\r\nSmyth.\r\n\r\nIn the debate on the Missouri question in the U.S. Congress, 1819-20,\r\nthe admission of Missouri to the Union, as a slave state, was urged,\r\namong other grounds, as a measure of humanity to the slaves of the\r\nsouth. Mr. Smyth, of Virginia said, \"The plan of our opponents seems\r\nto be to confine the slave population to the southern states, to the\r\ncountries where _sugar, cotton, and tobacco_ are cultivated. But, sir,\r\nby confining the slaves to a part of the country where crops are\r\nraised for exportation, and the bread and meat are _purchased, you\r\ndoom them to scarcity and hunger_. Is it not obvious that the way to\r\nrender their situation more comfortable, is to allow them to be taken\r\nwhere there is not the same motive to force the slave to INCESSANT\r\nTOIL, that there is in the country where cotton, sugar, and tobacco,\r\nare raised for exportation. It is proposed to hem in the blacks _where\r\nthey are_ HARD WORKED and ILL FED, that they may be rendered\r\nunproductive and the race be prevented from increasing. . . . The\r\nproposed measure would be EXTREME CRUELTY to the blacks. . . . You\r\nwould . . . doom them to SCARCITY and HARD LABOR.\"--[Speech of Mr.\r\nSmyth, Jan. 28, 1820]--See National Intelligencer.\r\n\r\nThose states where the crops are raised for exportation, and a large\r\npart of the provisions purchased, are, Louisiana, Mississippi,\r\nAlabama, Arkansas, Western Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, and, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, South Carolina. That this is the case in\r\nLouisiana, is shown by the following. \"Corn, flour, and bread stuffs,\r\ngenerally are obtained from Kentucky, Ohio;\" &c. See \"Emigrants Guide\r\nthrough the Valley of the Mississippi,\" Page 275. That it is the case\r\nwith Alabama, appears from the testimony of W. Jefferson Jones, Esq. a\r\nlawyer of high standing in Mobile. In a series of articles published\r\nby him in the Mobile Morning Chronicle, he says; (See that paper for\r\nAug. 26, 1837.)\r\n\r\n\"The people of Alabama _export_ what they raise, and _import_ nearly\r\nall they consume.\" But it seems quite unnecessary to prove, what all\r\npersons of much intelligence well know, that the states mentioned\r\nexport the larger part of what they raise, and import the larger part\r\nof what they consume. Now more than _one million of slaves_ are held\r\nin those states, and parts of states, where provisions are mainly\r\nimported, and consequently they are \"_doomed to scarcity and hunger_.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let us make some estimate of the proportion which the slaves,\r\nincluded in the foregoing _nine classes_, sustain to the whole number,\r\nand then of the proportion affected by the operation of the _seven_\r\ncauses just enumerated.\r\n\r\nIt would be nearly impossible to form an estimate of the proportion of\r\nthe slaves included in a number of these classes, such as the old, the\r\nworn out, the incurably diseased, maimed and deformed, idiots, feeble\r\ninfants, incorrigible slaves, &c. More or less of this description are\r\nto be found on all the considerable plantations, and often, many on\r\nthe same plantation; though we have no accurate data for an estimate,\r\nthe proportion cannot be less than one in twenty-five of the whole\r\nnumber of slaves, which would give a total of more than _one hundred\r\nthousand_. Of some of the remaining classes we have data for a pretty\r\naccurate estimate.\r\n\r\n1st. _Lunatics_.--Various estimates have been made, founded upon the\r\ndata procured by actual investigation, prosecuted under the direction\r\nof the Legislatures of different States; but the returns have been so\r\nimperfect and erroneous, that little reliance can be placed upon them.\r\nThe Legislature of New Hampshire recently ordered investigations to be\r\nmade in every town in the state, and the number of insane persons to\r\nbe reported. A committee of the legislature, who had the subject in\r\ncharge say, in their report--\"From many towns no returns have been\r\nreceived, from others the accounts are erroneous, there being cases\r\n_known to the committee_ which escaped the notice of the 'selectmen.'\r\nThe actual number of insane persons is therefore much larger than\r\nappears by the documents submitted to the committee.\" The Medical\r\nSociety of Connecticut appointed a committee of their number, composed\r\nof some of the most eminent physicians in the state, to ascertain and\r\nreport the whole number of insane persons in that state. The committee\r\nsay, in their report, \"The number of towns from which returns have\r\nbeen received is seventy, and the cases of insanity which have been\r\nnoticed in them are five hundred and ten.\" The committee add, \"fifty\r\nmore towns remain to be heard from, and if insanity should be found\r\nequally prevalent in them, the entire number will scarcely fall short\r\nof _one thousand_ in the state.\" This investigation was made in 1821,\r\nwhen the population of the state was less than two hundred and eighty\r\nthousand. If the estimate of the Medical Society be correct, the\r\nproportion of the insane to the whole population would be about one in\r\ntwo hundred and eighty. This strikes us as a large estimate, and yet a\r\ncommittee of the legislature of that state in 1837, reported seven\r\nhundred and seven insane persons in the state, who were either wholly\r\nor in part supported as _town paupers, or by charity_. It can hardly\r\nbe supposed that more than _two-thirds_ of the insane in Connecticut\r\nbelong to families _unable to support them_. On this supposition, the\r\nwhole number would be greater than the estimate of the Medical Society\r\nsixteen years previous, when the population was perhaps thirty\r\nthousand less. But to avoid the possibility of an over estimate, let\r\nus suppose the present number of insane persons in Connecticut to be\r\nonly seven hundred.\r\n\r\nThe population of the state is now probably about three hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand; according to this estimate, the proportion of the\r\ninsane to the whole population, would be one to about four hundred and\r\nsixty. Making this the basis of our calculation, and estimating the\r\nslaves in the United States at two millions, seven hundred thousand,\r\ntheir present probable number, and we come to this result, that there\r\nare about six thousand insane persons among the slaves of the United\r\nStates. We have no adequate data by which to judge whether the\r\nproportion of lunatics among slaves is greater or less than among the\r\nwhites; some considerations favor the supposition that it is less. But\r\nthe dreadful physical violence to which the slaves are subjected, and\r\nthe constant sunderings of their tenderest ties, might lead us to\r\nsuppose that it would be more. The only data in our possession is the\r\nofficial census of Chatham county, Georgia, for 1838, containing the\r\nnumber of lunatics among the whites and the slaves.--(See the Savannah\r\nGeorgian, July 24, 1838.) According to this census, the number of\r\nlunatics among eight thousand three hundred and seventy three whites\r\nin the country, is only _two,_ whereas, the number among ten thousand\r\neight hundred and ninety-one slaves, is _fourteen_.\r\n\r\n2d. _The Deaf and Dumb._--The proportion of deaf and dumb persons to\r\nthe other classes of the community, is about one in two thousand. This\r\nis the testimony of the directors of the 'American Asylum for the Deaf\r\nand Dumb,' located at Hartford, Connecticut. Making this the basis of\r\nour estimate, there would be one thousand six hundred deaf and dumb\r\npersons among the slaves of the United States.\r\n\r\n3d. _The Blind._--We have before us the last United States census,\r\nfrom which it appears, that in 1830, the number of blind persons in\r\nNew Hampshire was one hundred and seventeen, out of a population of\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-nine thousand five hundred and thirty-three.\r\nAdopting this as our basis, the number of blind slaves in the United\r\nStates would be nearly one thousand three hundred.\r\n\r\n4th. _Runaways._--Of the proportion of the slaves that run away, to\r\nthose that do not, and of the proportion of the runaways that are\r\n_taken_ to those that escape entirely, it would be difficult to make a\r\nprobable estimate. Something, however, can be done towards such an\r\nestimate. We have before us, in the Grand Gulf (Miss.) Advertiser, for\r\nAugust 2, 1838, a list of runaways that were then in the jails of the\r\ntwo counties of Adams and Warren, in that State; the names, ages, &c.\r\nof each one given; and their owners are called upon to take them away.\r\nThe number of runaways thus taken up and committed in these _two_\r\ncounties is FORTY-SIX. The whole number of _counties_ in Mississippi\r\nis _fifty-six._ Many of them, however, are thinly populated. Now,\r\nwithout making this the basis of our estimate for the whole slave\r\npopulation in all the state--which would doubtless make the number\r\nmuch too large--we are sure no one who has any knowledge of facts as\r\nthey are in the south, will charge upon us an over-statement when we\r\nsay, that of the present generation of slaves, probably _one in\r\nthirty_ is of that class--i.e., has at some time, perhaps often,\r\nrunaway and been retaken; on that supposition the whole number would\r\nbe not far from NINETY THOUSAND.\r\n\r\n5th. _Hired Slaves._--It is impossible to estimate with accuracy the\r\nproportion which the hired slaves bear to the whole number. That it is\r\nvery large all who have resided at the south, or traveled there, with\r\ntheir eyes open, well know. Some of the largest slaveholders in the\r\ncountry, instead of purchasing plantations and working their slaves\r\nthemselves, hire them out to others. This practice is very common.\r\n\r\nRev. Horace Moulton, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal church in\r\nMarlborough, Mass., who lived some years in Georgia, says: \"A _large\r\nproportion_ of the slave are owned by masters who keep them on purpose\r\nto hire out.\"\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of slaves, especially in Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, Alabama, and Florida, are owned by _non-residents_;\r\nthousands of them by northern capitalists, who _hire them out_. These\r\ncapitalists in many cases own large plantations, which are often\r\nleased for a term of years with a 'stock' of slaves sufficient to work\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMultitudes of slaves 'belonging' to _heirs_, are hired out by their\r\nguardians till such heirs become of age, or by the executors or\r\ntrustees of persons deceased.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may form some idea of the large number of slaves that\r\nare hired out, we insert below a few advertisements, as a specimen of\r\nhundreds in the newspapers of the slave states.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Pensacola Gazette,\" May 27.\r\n\r\n\"NOTICE TO SLAVEHOLDERS.

The actual proportion has been\r\nvariously estimated, at 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/2, &c. if we adopt the last\r\nas our basis, it will make the number of hired slaves, in the United\r\nStates, FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND!\r\n\r\n6th. _Slaves under overseers whose wages are a part of the\r\ncrop_.--That this is a common usage; appears from the following\r\ntestimony. The late Hon. John Taylor, of Caroline Co. Virginia, one of\r\nthe largest slaveholders in the state, President of the State\r\nAgricultural Society, and three times elected to the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, says, in his \"Agricultural Essays,\" No. 15. P. 57,\r\n\r\n\"This necessary class of men, (overseers,) are bribed by\r\nagriculturalists, not to improve, but to impoverish their land, _by a\r\nshare of the crop for one year_.... The _greatest_ annual crop, and\r\nnot the most judicious culture, advances his interest, and establishes\r\nhis character; and the fees of these land-doctors, are much higher for\r\nkilling than for curing.... The most which the land can yield, and\r\nseldom or never improvement with a view to future profit, is a point\r\nof common consent, and mutual need between the agriculturist and his\r\noverseer.... Must the practice of hiring a man for one year, by a\r\nshare of the crop, to lay out all his skill and industry in killing\r\nland, and as little as possible in improving it, be kept up to\r\ncommemorate the pious leaning of man to his primitive state of\r\nignorance and barbarity? _Unless this is abolished_, the attempt to\r\nfertilize our lands is needless.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilemon Bliss, Esq, of Elyria, Ohio, who lived in Florida, in 1834-5,\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n\"It is common for owners of plantations and slaves, to hire overseers\r\nto take charge of them, while they themselves reside at a distance.\r\n_Their wages depend principally upon the amount of labor which they\r\ncan exact from the slave_. The term \"good overseer,\" signifies one who\r\ncan make the greatest amount of the staple, cotton for instance, from\r\na given number of hands, besides raising sufficient provisions for\r\ntheir consumption. He has no interest in the life of the slave. Hence\r\nthe fact, so notorious at the south, that negroes are driven harder\r\nand fare worse under overseers than under their owners.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Ladd, Esq. of Minot, Maine, formerly a slaveholder in Florida,\r\nspeaking, in a recent letter of the system of labor adopted there,\r\nsays; \"The compensation of the overseers _was a certain portion of the\r\ncrop_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Phineas Smith, of Centreville, Allegany Co. N.Y. who has\r\nrecently returned from a four years' residence, in the Southern slave\r\nstates and Texas, says,\r\n\r\n\"The mode in which _many_ plantations are managed, is calculated and\r\n_designed_, as an inducement to the slave driver, to lay upon the\r\nslave the _greatest possible burden, the overseer being entitled by\r\ncontract, to a certain share of the crop_.\"\r\n\r\nWe leave the reader to form his own opinion, as to the proportion of\r\nslaves under overseers, whose wages are in proportion to the crop,\r\nraised by them. We have little doubt that we shall escape the charge\r\nof wishing to make out a \"strong case\" when we put the proportion at\r\n_one-eighth_ of the whole number of slaves, which would be _three\r\nhundred and fifty thousand_.\r\n\r\nWithout drawing out upon the page a sum in addition for the reader to\r\n\"run up,\" it is easily seen that the slaves in the preceding classes\r\namount to more than ELEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND, exclusive of the deaf and\r\ndumb, and the blind, some of whom, especially the former, might be\r\nprofitable to their \"owners\";\r\n\r\nNow it is plainly for the interest of the \"owners\" of these slaves, or\r\nof those who have the charge of them, to _treat than cruelly_, to\r\noverwork, under-feed, half-clothe, half-shelter, poison, or kill\r\noutright, the aged, the broken down, the incurably diseased, idiots,\r\nfeeble infants, most of the blind, some deaf and dumb, &c. It is\r\nbesides a part of the slave-holder's creed, that it is _for his\r\ninterest_ to treat with terrible severity, all runaways and the\r\nincorrigibly stubborn, thievish, lazy, &c.; also for those who hire\r\nslaves, to overwork them; also for overseers to overwork the slaves\r\nunder them, when their own wages are increased by it.\r\n\r\nWe have thus shown that it would be \"_for the interest_,\" of masters\r\nand overseers to treat with _habitual_ cruelty _more than one million_\r\nof the slaves in the United States. But this is not all; as we have\r\nsaid already, it is for the interest of overseers generally, whether\r\ntheir wages are proportioned to the crop or not, to overwork the\r\nslaves; we need not repeat the reasons.\r\n\r\nNeither is it necessary to re-state the arguments, going to show that\r\nit is for the interest of slaveholders, who cultivate the great\r\nsouthern staples, especially cotton, and the sugarcane, to overwork\r\nperiodically _all_ their slaves, and _habitually_ the majority of\r\nthem, when the demand for those staples creates high prices, as has\r\nbeen the case with cotton for many years, with little exception.\r\nInstead of entering into a labored estimate to get at the proportion\r\nof the slaves, affected by the operation of these and the other causes\r\nenumerated, we may say, that they operate _directly_ on the \"field\r\nhands,\" employed in raising the southern staples, and indirectly upon\r\nall classes of the slaves.\r\n\r\nFinally, the conclude this head by turning the objector's negative\r\nproposition into an affirmative one, and state formally what has been\r\nalready proved.\r\n\r\n_It is for the interest of shareholders, upon their own principles,\r\nand by their own showing, TO TREAT CRUELLY the great body of their\r\nslaves._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjection VI.--THE FACT THAT THE SLAVES MULTIPLY SO RAPIDLY PROVES\r\nTHAT THEY ARE NOT INHUMANELY TREATED, BUT ARE IN A COMFORTABLE\r\nCONDITION\r\n\r\nTo this we reply in brief, 1st. It has been already shown under a\r\nprevious head, that, in considerable sections of the slave states,\r\nespecially in the South West, the births among slaves are fewer than\r\nthe deaths, which would exhibit a fearful decrease of the slave\r\npopulation in those sections, if the deficiency were not made up by\r\nthe slave trade from the upper country.\r\n\r\n2d. The fact that all children born of slave _mothers_, whether their\r\nfathers are whites or free colored persons, are included in the census\r\nwith the slaves, and further that all children born of white mothers,\r\nwhose fathers are mulattos or blacks, are also included in the census\r\nwith colored persons and almost invariably with _slaves_, shows that\r\nit is impossible to ascertain with any accuracy, _what is the actual\r\nincrease of the slaves alone._\r\n\r\n3d. The fact that thousands of slaves, generally in the prime of life,\r\nare annually smuggled into the United States from Africa, Cuba, and\r\nelsewhere, makes it manifest that all inferences drawn from the\r\nincrease of the slave population, which do not make large deductions,\r\nfor constant importations, must be fallacious. Mr. Middleton of South\r\nCarolina, in a speech in Congress in 1819, declared that \"THIRTEEN\r\nTHOUSAND AFRICANS ARE ANNUALLY SMUGGLED INTO THE SOUTHERN STATES.\" Mr.\r\nMercer of Virginia, in a speech in Congress about the same time\r\ndeclared that \"_Cargoes_,\" of African slaves were smuggled into the\r\nSouth to a deplorable extent.\r\n\r\nMr. Wright, of Maryland, in a speech in Congress, estimated the number\r\nannually at FIFTEEN THOUSAND. Miss Martineau, in her recent work,\r\n(Society in America,) informs us that a large slaveholder in\r\nLouisiana, assured her in 1835, that the annual importation of native\r\nAfricans was from thirteen to fifteen thousand.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, in his message to Congress,\r\nDecember, 1837, says, \"The large force under Commodore Dallas, (on the\r\nWest India station,) has been most actively and efficiently employed\r\nin protecting our commerce, IN PREVENTING THE IMPORTATION OF SLAVES,\"\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Courier of 15th February, 1839, has these remarks:\r\n\r\n\"It is believed that African negroes have been _repeatedly_ introduced\r\ninto the United States. The number and the proximity of the Florida\r\nports to the island of Cuba, make it no difficult matter; nor is our\r\nextended frontier on the Sabine and Red rivers, at all unfavorable to\r\nthe smuggler. Human laws have, in all countries and ages, been\r\nviolated whenever the inducements to do so afforded hopes of great\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\"The United States' law against the importation of Africans, _could it\r\nbe strictly enforced_, might in a few years give the sugar and cotton\r\nplanters of Texas advantage over those of this state; as it would, we\r\napprehend, enable the former, under a stable government, to furnish\r\ncotton and sugar at a lower price than we can do. When giving\r\npublicity to such reflections as the subject seems to suggest, we\r\nprotest against being considered advocates for any violation of the\r\nlaws of our country. Every good citizen must respect those laws,\r\nnotwithstanding we may deem them likely to be evaded by men less\r\nscrupulous.\"\r\n\r\nThat both the south and north swarm with men 'less scrupulous,' every\r\none knows.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk (Va.) Beacon, of June 8, 1837, has the following:\r\n\r\n\"_Slave Trade.--Eight African negroes_ have been taken into custody,\r\nat Apalachicola, by the U.S. Deputy Marshal, alleged to have been\r\nimported from Cuba, on board the schooner Emperor, Captain Cox.\r\nIndictments for piracy, under the acts for the suppression of the\r\nslave trade, have been found against Captain Cox, and other parties\r\nimplicated. The negroes were bought in Cuba by a Frenchman named\r\nMalherbe, formerly a resident of Tallahassee, who was drowned soon\r\nafter the arrival of the schooner.\"\r\n\r\nThe following testimony of Rev. Horace Moulton, now a minister of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, in Marlborough, Mass., who resided some\r\nyears in Georgia, reveals some of the secrets of the slave-smugglers,\r\nand the connivance of the Georgia authorities at their doings. It is\r\ncontained in a letter dated February 24, 1839.\r\n\r\n\"The foreign slave-trade was carried on to some considerable extent\r\nwhen I was at the south, notwithstanding a law had been made some ten\r\nyears previous to this, making this traffic piracy on the high seas. I\r\nwas somewhat acquainted with the secrets of this traffic, and, I\r\nsuppose, I might have engaged in it, had I so desired. Were you to\r\nvisit all the plantations in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and\r\nMississippi, I think you would be convinced that the horrors of the\r\ntraffic in human flesh have not yet ceased. I was _surprised to find\r\nso many that could not speak English among the slaves,_ until the\r\nmystery was explained. This was done, when I learned that\r\nslave-cargoes were landed on the coast of Florida, not a thousand\r\nmiles from St. Augustine. They could, and can still, in my opinion, be\r\nlanded as safely on this coast as in any port of this continent. You\r\ncan imagine for yourself how easy it was to carry on the traffic\r\nbetween this place and the West Indies. When landed on the coast of\r\nFlorida, it is an easy matter to distribute them throughout the more\r\nsouthern states. The law which makes it piracy to traffic in the\r\nforeign slave trade is a dead letter; and I doubt not it has been so\r\nin the more southern states ever since it was enacted. For you can\r\nperceive at once, that interested men, who believe the colored man is so\r\nmuch better off here than he possibly can be in Africa, will not\r\nhesitate to kidnap the blacks whenever an opportunity presents itself.\r\nI will notice one fact that came under my own observation, which will\r\nconvince you that the horrors of the foreign slave-trade have not yet\r\nceased among our southern gentry. It is as follows. A slave ship,\r\nwhich I have reason to believe was employed by southern men, came near\r\nthe port of Savannah with about FIVE HUNDRED SLAVES, from Guinea and\r\nCongo. It was said that the ship was driven there by contrary winds;\r\nand the crew, pretending to be short of provisions, run the ship into\r\na by place, near the shore, between Tybee Light and Darien, to recruit\r\ntheir stores. Well, as Providence would have it, the revenue cutter,\r\nat that time taking a trip along the coast, fell in with this slave\r\nship, took her as a prize, and brought her up into the port of\r\nSavannah. The cargo of human chattels was unloaded, and the captives\r\nwere placed in an old barracks, in the fort of Savannah, under the\r\nprotection of the city authorities, they pretending that they should\r\nreturn them all to their native country again, as soon as a convenient\r\nopportunity presented itself. The ship's crew of course were arrested,\r\nand confined in jail. Now for the sequel of this history. About one\r\nthird part of the negroes died in a few weeks after they were landed,\r\nin seasoning, so called, or in becoming acclimated--or, as I should\r\nthink, a distemper broke out among them, and they died like the\r\nIsraelites when smitten with the plague. Those who did not die in\r\nseasoning, must be hired out a little while, to be sure, as the city\r\nauthorities could not afford to keep them on expense doing nothing. As\r\nit happened, the man in whose employ I was when the cargo of human\r\nbeings arrived, hired some twenty or thirty of them, and put them\r\nunder my care. They continued with me until the sickly season drove me\r\noff to the north. I soon returned, but could not hear a word about the\r\ncrew of pirates. They had something like a mock trial, as I should\r\nthink, for no one, as I ever learned, was condemned, fined, or\r\ncensured. But where were the poor captives, who were going to be\r\nreturned to Africa by the city authorities, as soon as they could make\r\nit convenient? Oh, forsooth, those of whom I spoke, being under my\r\ncare, were tugging away for the same man; the remainder were scattered\r\nabout among different planters. When I returned to the north again,\r\nthe next year, the city authorities had not, down to that time; made\r\nit convenient to return these poor victims. The fact is, they belonged\r\nthere; and, in my opinion, they were designed to be landed near by the\r\nplace where the revenue cutter seized them. Probably those very\r\nplanters for whom they were originally designed received them; and\r\nstill there was a pretence kept up that they would be returned to\r\nAfrica. This must have been done, that the consciences of those might\r\nbe quieted, who were looking for justice to be administered to these\r\npoor captives. It is easy for a company of slaveholders, who desire to\r\ntraffic in human flesh, to fit out a vessel, under Spanish colors, and\r\nthen go prowling about the African coast for the victims of their\r\nlusts. If all the facts with relation to the African slave-trade, now\r\nsecretly carried on at the south, could be disclosed, the people of\r\nthe free states would be filled with amazement.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain, from the nature of this trade, and the circumstances\r\nunder which it is carried on, that the number of slaves imported would\r\nbe likely to be estimated far _below_ the truth. There can be little\r\ndoubt that the estimate of Mr. Wright, of Maryland, (fifteen thousand\r\nannually,) is some thousands too small. But even according to his\r\nestimate, the African slave-trade adds ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND\r\nSLAVES TO EACH UNITED STATES' CENSUS. These are in the prime of life,\r\nand their children would swell the slave population many thousands\r\nannually--thus making a great addition to each census.\r\n\r\n4. It is a notorious fact, that large numbers of free colored persons\r\nare kidnapped every year in the free states, taken to the south, and\r\nsold as slaves.\r\n\r\nHon. GEORGE M. STROUD, Judge of the Criminal Court of Philadelphia, in\r\nhis sketch of the slave laws, speaking of the kidnapping of free\r\ncolored persons in the northern states, says--\r\n\r\n\"Remote as is the city of Philadelphia from those slaveholding states\r\nin which the introduction of slaves from places within the territory\r\nof the United States is freely permitted, and where also the market is\r\ntempting, _it has been ascertained,_ that MORE THAN THIRTY FREE\r\nCOLORED PERSONS, MOSTLY CHILDREN, HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED HERE, AND\r\nCARRIED AWAY, WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS. Five of these, through the\r\nkind interposition of several humane gentlemen, have been restored to\r\ntheir friends, though not without _great expense and difficulty_; the\r\nothers _are still retained in bondage_, and if rescued at all, it must\r\nbe by sending white witnesses a journey of more than a thousand miles.\r\nThe costs attendant upon lawsuits, under such circumstances, will\r\nprobably fall but little short of the estimated value, as slaves, of\r\nthe individuals kidnapped.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from Mrs. CHILD's Appeal, pp. 64-6.\r\n\r\n\"I know the names of four colored citizens of Massachusetts, who went\r\nto Georgia on board a vessel, were seized under the laws of that\r\nstate, and sold as slaves. They have sent the most earnest\r\nexhortations to their families and friends, to do something for their\r\nrelief; but the attendant expenses require more money than the friends\r\nof negroes are apt to have, and the poor fellows, as yet, remain\r\nunassisted.\r\n\r\n\"A New York paper, of November, 1829, contains the following caution.\r\n\r\n_\"Beware of Kidnappers!_--It is well understood, that there is at\r\npresent in this city, a gang of kidnappers, busily engaged in their\r\nvocation, of stealing colored children for the southern market. It is\r\nbelieved that three or four have been stolen within as many days.\r\nThere are suspicions of a foul nature connected with some who serve\r\nthe police in subordinate capacities. It is hinted that there may be\r\nthose in some authority, not altogether ignorant of these diabolical\r\npractices. Let the public be on their guard! It is still fresh in the\r\nmemories of all, that a cargo, or rather drove of negroes, was made up\r\nfrom this city and Philadelphia, about the time that the emancipation\r\nof all the negroes in this state took place, under our present\r\nconstitution, and were taken through Virginia, the Carolinas, and\r\nTennessee, and disposed of in the state of Mississippi. Some of those\r\nwho were taken from Philadelphia were persons of intelligence; and\r\nafter they had been driven through the country in chains, and disposed\r\nof by sale on the Mississippi, wrote back to their friends, and were\r\nrescued from bondage. The persons who were guilty of this abominable\r\ntransaction are known, and now reside in North Carolina. They may very\r\nprobably be engaged in similar enterprizes at the present time--at\r\nleast there is reason to believe, that the system of kidnapping free\r\npersons of color from the northern cities, has been carried on more\r\nextensively than the public arc generally aware of.\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE BRADBURN, Esq. of Nantucket, Mass. a member of the Legislature\r\nof that state, at its last session, made a report to that body, March\r\n6, 1839, 'On the deliverance of citizens liable to be sold as slaves.'\r\nThat report contains the following facts and testimony.\r\n\r\n\"The following facts are a few out of a VAST MULTITUDE, to which the\r\nattention of the undersigned has been directed.\r\n\r\n\"On the 27th of February last, the undersigned had an interview with\r\nthe Rev. Samuel Snowden, a respectable and intelligent clergyman of\r\nthe city of Boston. This gentleman stated, and he is now ready to make\r\noath, that during the last six years, he has himself, by the aid of\r\nvarious benevolent individuals, procured the deliverance from jail of\r\nsix citizens of Massachusetts, who had been, arrested and imprisoned\r\nas runaway slaves, and who, but for his timely interposition, would\r\nhave been sold into perpetual bondage. The names and the places of\r\nimprisonment of those persons, as stated by Mr. S. were as follows:\r\n\r\n\"James Hight, imprisoned at Mobile; William Adams, at Norfolk; William\r\nHolmes, also at Norfolk; James Oxford, at Wilmington; James Smith, at\r\nBaton Rouge; John Tidd, at New Orleans.\r\n\r\n\"In 1836, Mary Smith, a native of this state, returning from New\r\nOrleans, whither she had been in the capacity of a servant, was cast\r\nupon the shores of North Carolina. She was there seized and sold as a\r\nslave. Information of the fact reached her friends at Boston. Those\r\nfriends made an effort to obtain her liberation. They invoked the\r\nassistance of the Governor of this Commonwealth. A correspondence\r\nensued between His Excellency and the Governor of North Carolina:\r\ncopies of which were offered for the inspection of your committee.\r\nSoon afterwards, by permission of the authorities of North Carolina,\r\n'Mary Smith' returned to Boston. But it turned out, that this was not\r\n_the_ Mary Smith, whom our worthy Governor, and other excellent\r\nindividuals of Boston, had taken so unwearied pains to redeem from\r\nslavery. It was another woman, of the same name, who was also a native\r\nof Massachusetts, and had been seized in North Carolina as a runaway\r\nslave. The Mary Smith has not yet been heard of. If alive, she is now,\r\nin all probability, wearing the chains of slavery.\r\n\r\n\"About a year and a half since, several citizens of different free\r\nstates were rescued from slavery, at New Orleans, by the direct\r\npersonal efforts of an acquaintance of the undersigned. The benevolent\r\nindividual alluded to is Jacob Barker, Esq. a name not unknown to the\r\ncommercial world. Mr. Barker is a resident of New Orleans. A statement\r\nof the cases in reference is contained in a letter addressed by him to\r\nthe Hon. Samuel H. Jenks, of Nantucket.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter of Mr. Barker, referred to in this report to the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts, bears date August 19, 1837. The\r\nfollowing are extracts from it.\r\n\r\n\"A free man, belonging to Baltimore, by the name of Ephraim Larkin,\r\nwho came here cook of the William Tell, was arrested and thrown into\r\nprison a few weeks since, and sent in chains to work on the road. I\r\nheard of it, and with difficulty found him; and after the most\r\ndiligent and active exertions, got him released--in effecting which, I\r\ntraveled in the heat of the day, thermometer ranging in the shade from\r\n94 to 100, more than twenty times to and from prison, the place of his\r\nlabor, and the different courts, a distance of near three miles from\r\nmy residence; and after I had established his freedom, had to pay for\r\nhis arrest, maintenance, and the advertising him as a runaway slave,\r\n$29.89, as per copy of bill herewith--the allowance for work not\r\nequalling the expenses, the amount augments with every day of\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\n\"In pursuing the cook of the William Tell, I found three other free\r\nmen, confined in the same prison; one belonged also to Baltimore, by\r\nthe name of Leaven Dogerty: he was also released, on my paying $28\r\nexpenses; one was a descendant of the Indians who once inhabited\r\nNantucket--his name is Eral Lonnon. Lonnon had been six weeks in\r\nprison; he was released without difficulty, on my paying $20.38\r\nexpenses--and no one seemed to know why he had been confined or\r\narrested, as the law does not presume persons of mixed blood to be\r\nslaves. But for the others, I had great difficulty in procuring what\r\nwas considered competent witnesses to prove them free. No complaint of\r\nimproper conduct had been made against either of them. At one time,\r\nthe Recorder said the witness must be white; at another, that one\r\nrespectable witness was insufficient; at another, that a person who\r\nhad been (improperly) confined and released, was not a competent\r\nwitness, &c. &c. Lonnon has been employed in the South Sea fishery\r\nfrom Nantucket and New Bedford, nearly all his life; has sailed on\r\nthose voyages in the ships Eagle, Maryland, Gideon, Triton, and\r\nSamuel. He was born at Marshpee, Plymouth (Barnstable) county, Mass.\r\nand prefers to encounter the leviathan of the deep, rather than the\r\nturnkeys of New Orleans.\r\n\r\n\"The other was born in St. Johns, Nova Scotia, and bears the name of\r\nWilliam Smith, a seaman by profession.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after these men were released, two others were arrested.\r\nThey attempted to escape, and being pursued, ran for the river, in the\r\nvain hope of being able to swim across the Mississippi, a distance of\r\na mile, with a current of four knots. One soon gave out, and made for\r\na boat which had been despatched for their recovery, and was saved;\r\nthe other being a better swimmer, continued on until much exhausted,\r\nthen also made for the boat--it was too late; he sank before the boat\r\ncould reach him, and was drowned. They claimed to be freemen.\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday last I was called to the prison of the Municipality in\r\nwhich I reside, to serve on an inquest on the body of a drowned man.\r\nThere I saw one other free man confined, by the name of Henry Tier, a\r\nyellow man, born in New York, and formerly in my employ. He had been\r\nconfined as a supposed runaway, near six months, without a particle of\r\ntestimony; although from his color, the laws of Louisiana presume him\r\nto be free. I applied immediately for his release, which was promptly\r\ngranted. At first, expenses similar to those exacted in the third\r\nMunicipality were required; but on my demonstrating to the recorder\r\nthat the law imposed no such burden on free men, he was released\r\nwithout any charge whatever. How free men can obtain satisfaction for\r\nhaving been thus wrongfully imprisoned, and made to work in chains on\r\nthe highway, is not for me to decide. I apprehend no satisfaction can\r\nbe had without more active friends, willing to espouse their cause,\r\nthan can be found in this quarter. Therefore I repeat, that no person\r\nof color should come here without a certificate of freedom from the\r\ngovernor of the state to which he belongs.\r\n\r\n\"Very respectfully, your assured friend, Jacob Barker.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"N.B.--Since writing the preceding, I have procured the release of\r\nanother free man from the prison of the third Municipality, on the\r\npayment of $39.65, as per bill, copy herewith. His name is William\r\nLockman--he was born in New Jersey, of free parents, and resides at\r\nPhiladelphia. A greater sum was required which was reduced by the\r\nallowance of his maintenance (written _labor_,) while at work on the\r\nroad, which the law requires the Municipality to pay; but it had not\r\nbefore been so expounded in the third Municipality. I hope to get it\r\nback in the case of the other three. The allowance for labor, in\r\naddition to their maintenance, is twenty-five cents per day; but they\r\nrequire those illiterate men to advance the whole before they can\r\nleave the prison, and then to take a certificate for their labor, and\r\ngo for it to another department--to collect which, is ten times more\r\ntrouble than the money when received is worth. While these free men,\r\nwithout having committed any fault, were compelled to work in chains,\r\non the roads, in the burning sun, for 25 cents per day, and pay in\r\nadvance 18 3-4 cents per day for maintenance, doctor's, and other\r\nbills, and not able to work half their time, I paid others, working on\r\nship-board, in sight, two dollars per day. J.B.\"\r\n\r\nThe preceding letter of Mr. Barker, furnishes grounds for the belief,\r\nthat _hundreds_, if not _thousands_ of free colored persons, from the\r\ndifferent states of this Union, both slave and free from the West\r\nIndies, South America, Mexico, and the British possessions in North\r\nAmerica, and from other parts of the world, are reduced to slavery\r\n_every year_ in our slave states. If a single individual, in the\r\ncourse of a few days, _accidentally_ discovered _six_ colored free\r\nmen, working in irons, and soon to be sold as slaves, in a _single_\r\nsouthern city, is it not fair to infer, that in all the slave states,\r\nthere must be _multitudes_ of such persons, now in slavery, and that\r\nthis number is rapidly increasing, by ceaseless accessions?\r\n\r\nThe letter of Mr. Barker is valuable, also, as a graphic delineation\r\nof the 'public opinion' of the south. The great difficulty with which\r\nthe release of these free men was procured, notwithstanding the\r\npersonal efforts of Mr. Jacob Barker, who is a gentleman of influence,\r\nand has, we believe, been an alderman of New Orleans, reveals a\r\n'public opinion,' insensible as adamant to the liberty of colored men.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to fill scores of pages with details similar to the\r\npreceding. We have furnished enough, however, to show, that, in all\r\nprobability, _each_ United States' census of the _slave_ population,\r\nis increased by the addition to it of _thousands_ of free colored\r\npersons, kidnapped and sold as slaves.\r\n\r\n5th. To argue that the rapid multiplication of any class in the\r\ncommunity, is proof that such a class is well-clothed, well-housed,\r\nabundantly fed, and very _comfortable_, is as absurd as to argue that\r\nthose who have _few children_, must of course, be ill-clothed,\r\nill-housed, badly lodged, overworked, ill-fed, &c. &c. True,\r\nprivations and inflictions may be carried to such an extent as to\r\noccasion a fearful diminishment of population. That was the case\r\ngenerally with the slave population in the West Indies, and, as has\r\nbeen shown, is true of certain portions of the southern states. But\r\nthe fact that such an effect is _not_ produced, does not prove that\r\nthe slaves do not experience great privations and severe inflictions.\r\nThey may suffer much hardship, and great cruelties, without\r\nexperiencing so great a derangement of the vital functions as to\r\nprevent child-bearing. The Israelites multiplied with astonishing\r\nrapidity, under the task-masters and burdens of Egypt. Does this\r\nfalsify the declarations of Scripture, that 'they sighed by reason of\r\ntheir bondage,' and that the Egyptians 'made them serve _with rigor_,'\r\nand made 'their lives bitter with _hard bondage_.' 'I have seen,' said\r\nGod, 'their _afflictions_. I have beard their _groanings_,' &c. The\r\nhistory of the human race shows, that great _privations and much\r\nsuffering_ may be experienced, without materially checking the rapid\r\nincrease of population.\r\n\r\nBesides, if we should give to the objection all it claims, it would\r\nmerely prove, that the female slaves, or rather a portion of them, are\r\nin a comfortable condition; and that, so far as the absolute\r\nnecessities of life are concerned, the females of _child-bearing_ age,\r\nin Delaware, Maryland, northern, western, and middle Virginia, the\r\nupper parts of Kentucky and Missouri, and among the mountains of east\r\nTennessee and western North Carolina, are in general tolerably well\r\nsupplied. The same remark, with some qualifications, may be made of\r\nthe slaves generally, in those parts of the country where the people\r\nare slaveholders, mainly, that they may enjoy the privilege and profit\r\nof being _slave-breeders_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION VIII.--'PUBLIC OPINION IS A PROTECTION TO THE SLAVE.'\r\n\r\nANSWER. It was public opinion that _made him a slave_. In a republican\r\ngovernment the people make the laws, and those laws are merely public\r\nopinion _in legal forms_. We repeat it,--public opinion made them\r\nslaves, and keeps them slaves; in other words, it sunk them from men\r\nto chattels, and now, forsooth, this same public opinion will see to\r\nit, that these _chattels_ are treated like _men!_\r\n\r\nBy looking a little into this matter, and finding out how this 'public\r\nopinion' (law) protects the slaves in some particulars, we can judge\r\nof the amount of its protection in others. 1. It protects the slaves\r\nfrom _robbery_, by declaring that those who robbed their mothers may\r\nrob them and their children. \"All negroes, mulattoes, or mestizoes who\r\nnow are, or shall hereafter be in this province, and all their\r\noffspring, are hereby declared to be, and shall remain, forever,\r\nhereafter, absolute slaves, and shall follow the condition of the\r\nmother.\"--Law of South Carolina, 2 Brevard's Digest, 229. Others of\r\nthe slave states have similar laws.\r\n\r\n2. It protects their _persons_, by giving their master a right to\r\nflog, wound, and beat them when he pleases. See Devereaux's North\r\nCarolina Reports, 263.--Case of the State vs. Mann, 1829; in which the\r\nSupreme Court decided, that a master who _shot_ at a female slave and\r\nwounded her, because she got loose from him when he was flogging her,\r\nand started to run from him, had violated _no law_, AND COULD NOT BE\r\nINDICTED. It has been decided by the highest courts of the slave\r\nstates generally, that assault and battery upon a slave is not\r\nindictable as a criminal offence.\r\n\r\nThe following decision on this point was made by the Supreme Court of\r\nSouth Carolina in the case of the State vs. Cheetwood, 2 Hill's\r\nReports, 459.\r\n\r\n_Protection of slaves_.--\"The criminal offence of assault and battery\r\n_cannot, at common law, be committed on the person of a slave_. For,\r\nnotwithstanding for some purposes a slave is regarded in law as a\r\nperson, yet generally he is a mere chattel personal, and his right of\r\npersonal protection belongs to his master, who can maintain an action\r\nof trespass for the battery of his slave.\r\n\r\n\"There can be therefore no offence against the state for a mere\r\nbeating of a slave, unaccompanied by any circumstances of cruelty, or\r\nan attempt to kill and murder. The peace of the state is not thereby\r\nbroken; for a slave is not generally regarded as legally capable of\r\nbeing within the peace of the state. He is not a citizen, and _is not\r\nin that character entitled to her protection_.\"\r\n\r\nThis 'public opinion' protects the _persons_ of the slaves by\r\ndepriving them of Jury trial;[28] their _consciences_, by forbidding\r\nthem to assemble for worship, unless their oppressors are present;[29]\r\ntheir _characters_, by branding them as liars, in denying them their\r\noath in law;[30] their _modesty_, by leaving their master to clothe,\r\nor let them go naked, as he pleases;[31] and their _health_, by\r\nleaving him to feed or starve them, to work them, wet or dry, with or\r\nwithout sleep, to lodge them, with or without covering, as the whim\r\ntakes him;[32] and their _liberty_, marriage relations, parental\r\nauthority, and filial obligations, by _annihilating_ the whole.[33]\r\nThis is the protection which 'PUBLIC OPINION,' in the form of _law_,\r\naffords to the slaves; this is the chivalrous knight, always in\r\nstirrups, with lance in rest, to champion the cause of the slaves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Law of South Carolina. James' Digest, 392-3. Law of\r\nLouisiana. Martin's Digest, 42. Law of Virginia. Rev. Code, 429.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Miss. Rev. Code, 390. Similar laws exist in the slave\r\nstates generally.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: \"A slave cannot be a witness against a white person,\r\neither in a civil or criminal cause.\" Stroud's Sketch of the Laws of\r\nSlavery, 65.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Stroud's Sketch of the Slave Laws, 132.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Stroud's Sketch, 26-32.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Stroud's Sketch, 22-24.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic opinion, protection to the slave! Brazen effrontery, hypocrisy,\r\nand falsehood! We have, in the laws cited and referred to above, the\r\nformal testimony of the Legislatures of the slave states, that,\r\n'public opinion' does pertinaciously _refuse_ to protect the slaves;\r\nnot only so, but that it does itself persecute and plunder them all:\r\nthat it originally planned, and now presides over, sanctions, executes\r\nand perpetuates the whole system of robbery, torture, and outrage\r\nunder which they groan.\r\n\r\nIn all the slave states, this 'public opinion' has taken away from the\r\nslave his _liberty_; it has robbed him of his right to his own body,\r\nof his right to improve his mind, of his right to read the Bible, of\r\nhis right to worship God according to his conscience, of his right to\r\nreceive and enjoy what he earns, of his right to live with his wife\r\nand children, of his right to better his condition, of his right to\r\neat when he is hungry, to rest when he is tired, to sleep when be\r\nneeds it, and to cover his nakedness with clothing: this 'public\r\nopinion' makes the slave a prisoner for life on the plantation, except\r\nwhen his jailor pleases to let him out with a 'pass,' or sells him,\r\nand transfers him in irons to another jail-yard: this 'public opinion'\r\ntraverses the country, buying up men, women, children--chaining them\r\nin coffles, and driving them forever from their nearest friends; it\r\nsets them on the auction table, to be handled, scrutinized, knocked\r\noff to the highest bidder; it proclaims that they shall not have their\r\nliberty; and, if their masters give it them, 'public opinion' seizes\r\nand throws them back into slavery. This same 'public opinion' has\r\nformally attached the following legal penalties to the following acts\r\nof slaves.\r\n\r\nIf more than seven slaves are found together in any road, without a\r\nwhite person, _twenty lashes a piece_; for visiting a plantation\r\nwithout a written pass, ten lashes; for letting loose a boat from\r\nwhere it is made fast, _thirty-nine lashes for the first offence_; and\r\nfor the second, '_shall have cut off from his head one ear_;' for\r\nkeeping or carrying a _club, thirty-nine lashes_; for having any\r\narticle for sale, without a ticket from his master, _ten lashes_; for\r\ntraveling in any other than 'the most usual and accustomed road,' when\r\ngoing alone to any place, _forty lashes_; for traveling in the night,\r\nwithout a pass, _forty lashes_; for being found in another person's\r\nnegro-quarters, _forty lashes_; for hunting with dogs in the woods,\r\n_thirty lashes_; for being on _horseback_ without the written\r\npermission of his master, _twenty-five lashes_; for riding or going\r\nabroad in the night, or riding horses in the day time, without leave,\r\na slave may be whipped, _cropped_, or _branded in the cheek_ with the\r\nletter R, or otherwise punished, _not extending to life_, or so as to\r\nrender him _unfit for labor_. The laws referred to may be found by\r\nconsulting 2 Brevard's Digest, 228, 213, 216; Haywood's Manual, 78,\r\nchap. 13, pp. 518, 529; 1 Virginia Revised Code, 722-3; Prince's\r\nDigest, 454; 2 Missouri Laws, 741; Mississippi Revised Code, 571. Laws\r\nsimilar to these exist throughout the southern slave code. Extracts\r\nenough to fill a volume might be made from these laws, showing that\r\nthe protection which 'public opinion' grants to the slaves, is hunger,\r\nnakedness, terror, bereavements, robbery, imprisonment, the stocks,\r\niron collars, hunting and worrying them with dogs and guns, mutilating\r\ntheir bodies, and murdering them.\r\n\r\nA few specimens of the laws and the judicial decisions on them, will\r\nshow what is the state of 'public opinion' among slaveholders towards\r\ntheir slaves. Let the following suffice.--'Any person may lawfully\r\nkill a slave, who has been outlawed for running away and lurking in\r\nswamps, &c.'--Law of North Carolina; Judge Stroud's Sketch of the\r\nSlave Laws, 103; Haywood's Manual, 524. 'A slave _endeavoring_ to\r\nentice another slave to runaway, if provisions, &c. be prepared for\r\nthe purpose of aiding in such running away, shall be punished with\r\nDEATH. And a slave who shall aid the slave so endeavoring to entice\r\nanother slave to run away, shall also suffer DEATH.'--Law of South\r\nCarolina; Stroud's Sketch of Slave Laws, 103-4; 2 Brevard's Digest,\r\n233, 244. Another law of South Carolina provides that if a slave\r\nshall, when absent from the plantation, refuse to be examined by '_any\r\nwhite_ person,' (no matter how crazy or drunk,) 'such white person may\r\nseize and chastise him; and if the slave shall _strike_ such white\r\nperson, such slave may be lawfully killed.'--2 Brevard's Digest, 231.\r\n\r\nThe following is a law of Georgia.--'If any slave shall presume to\r\nstrike any white person, such slave shall, upon trial and conviction\r\nbefore the justice or justices, suffer such punishment for the first\r\noffence as they shall think fit, not extending to life or limb; and\r\nfor the second offence, DEATH.'--Prince's Digest, 450. The same law\r\nexists in South Carolina, with this difference, that death is made the\r\npunishment for the _third_ offence. In both states, the law contains\r\nthis remarkable proviso: 'Provided always, that such striking be not\r\ndone by the command and in the defence of the person or property of\r\nthe owner, or other person having the government of such slave, in\r\nwhich case the slave shall be wholly excused!' According to this law,\r\nif a slave, by the direction of his OVERSEER, strike a white man who\r\nis beating said overseer's _dog_, 'the slave shall be wholly excused;'\r\nbut if the white man has rushed upon the slave himself, instead of the\r\n_dog_, and is furiously beating him, if the slave strike back but a\r\nsingle blow, the legal penalty is 'ANY _punishment_ not extending to\r\nlife or limb;' and if the tortured slave has a second onset made upon\r\nhim, and, after suffering all but death, again strike back in\r\nself-defence, the law KILLS him for it. So, if a female slave, in\r\nobedience to her mistress, and in defence of 'her property,' strike a\r\nwhite man who is kicking her mistress' pet kitten, she 'shall be\r\nwholly excused,' saith the considerate law: but if the unprotected\r\ngirl, when beaten and kicked _herself_, raise her hand against her\r\nbrutal assailant, the law condemns her to 'any punishment, not\r\nextending to life or limb; and if a wretch assail her again, and\r\nattempt to violate her chastity, and the trembling girl, in her\r\nanguish and terror, instinctively raise her hand against him in\r\nself-defence, she shall, saith the law, 'suffer DEATH.'\r\n\r\nReader, this diabolical law is the 'public opinion' of Georgia and\r\nSouth Carolina toward the slaves. This is the vaunted 'protection'\r\nafforded them by their 'high-souled chivalry.' To show that the\r\n'public opinion' of the slave states far more effectually protects the\r\n_property_ of the master than the _person_ of the slave, the reader is\r\nreferred to two laws of Louisiana, passed in 1819. The one attaches a\r\npenalty 'not exceeding one thousand dollars,' and 'imprisonment not\r\nexceeding two years,' to the crime of 'cutting or breaking any iron\r\nchain or collar,' which any master of slaves has used to prevent their\r\nrunning away; the other, a penalty 'not exceeding five hundred\r\ndollars,' to 'wilfully cutting out the tongue, putting out the eye,\r\n_cruelly_ burning, or depriving any slave of _any limb_.' Look at\r\nit--the most horrible dismemberment conceivable cannot be punished by\r\na fine of _more_ than five hundred dollars. The law expressly fixes\r\nthat, as the utmost limit, and it _may_ not be half that sum; not a\r\nsingle moment's imprisonment stays the wretch in his career, and the\r\nnext hour he may cut out another slave's tongue, or burn his hand off.\r\nBut let the same man break a chain put upon a slave, to keep him from\r\nrunning away, and, besides paying double the penalty that could be\r\nexacted from him for cutting off a slave's leg, the law imprisons him\r\nnot exceeding two years!\r\n\r\nThis law reveals the _heart_ of slaveholders towards their slaves,\r\ntheir diabolical indifference to the most excruciating and protracted\r\ntorments inflicted on them by '_any_ person;' it reveals, too, the\r\n_relative_ protection afforded by 'public opinion' to the _person_ of\r\nthe slave, in appalling contrast with the vastly surer protection\r\nwhich it affords to the master's _property_ in the slave. The wretch\r\nwho cuts out the tongue, tears out the eyes, shoots off the arms, or\r\nburns off the feet of a slave, over a slow fire, _cannot_ legally be\r\nfined more than five hundred dollars; but if he should in pity loose a\r\nchain from his galled neck, placed there by the master to keep him\r\nfrom escaping, and thus put his property in some jeopardy, he may be\r\nfined _one thousand dollars_, and thrust into a dungeon for two years!\r\nand this, be it remembered, not for _stealing_ the slave from the\r\nmaster, nor for _enticing_, or even advising him to run away, or\r\ngiving him any information how he can effect his escape; but merely,\r\nbecause, touched with sympathy for the bleeding victim, as he sees the\r\nrough iron chafe the torn flesh at every turn, he removes it;--and, as\r\nescape without this incumbrance would be easier than with it, the\r\nmaster's property in the slave is put at some risk. For having caused\r\nthis slight risk, the law provides a punishment--fine not exceeding\r\none thousand dollars, and imprisonment not exceeding _two years_. We\r\nsay 'slight risk,' because the slave may not be disposed to encounter\r\nthe dangers, and hunger, and other sufferings of the woods, and the\r\ncertainty of terrible inflictions if caught; and if he should attempt\r\nit, the risk of losing him is small. An advertisement of five lines\r\nwill set the whole community howling on his track; and the trembling\r\nand famished fugitive is soon scented out in his retreat, and dragged\r\nback and delivered over to his tormentors.\r\n\r\nThe preceding law is another illustration of the 'protection' afforded\r\nto the limbs and members of slaves, by 'public opinion' among\r\nslaveholders.\r\n\r\nHere follow two other illustrations of the brutal indifference of\r\n'public opinion' to the _torments_ of the slave, while it is full of\r\nzeal to compensate the master, if any one disables his slave so as to\r\nlessen his market value. The first is a law of South Carolina. It\r\nprovides, that if a slave, engaged in his owner's service, be attacked\r\nby a person 'not having sufficient cause for so doing,' and if the\r\nslave shall be '_maimed or disabled_' by him, so that the owner\r\nsuffers a loss from his inability to labor, the person maiming him\r\nshall pay for his 'lost time,' and 'also the charges for the cure of\r\nthe slave!' This Vandal law does not deign to take the least notice of\r\nthe anguish of the '_maimed' slave_, made, perhaps, a groaning cripple\r\nfor life; the horrible wrong and injury done to _him_, is passed over\r\nin utter silence. It is thus declared to be _not a criminal act_. But\r\nthe pecuniary interests of the master are not to be thus neglected by\r\n'public opinion'. Oh no! its tender bowels run over with sympathy at\r\nthe master's injury in the 'lost _time_' of his slave, and it\r\ncarefully provides that he shall have pay for the whole of it.--See 2\r\n_Brevard's Digest_, 231, 2.\r\n\r\nA law similar to the above has been passed in Louisiana, which\r\ncontains an additional provision for the benefit of the\r\n_master_--ordaining, that 'if the slave' (thus _maimed and disabled_,)\r\n'be forever rendered unable to work,' the person maiming, shall pay\r\nthe master the appraised value of the slave before the injury, and\r\nshall, in addition, _take_ the slave, and maintain him during life.'\r\nThus 'public opinion' transfers the helpless cripple from the hand of\r\nhis master, who, as he has always had the benefit of his services,\r\nmight possibly feel some tenderness for him, and puts him in the sole\r\npower of the wretch who has disabled him for life--protecting the\r\nvictim from the fury of his tormentor, by putting him into his hands!\r\nWhat but butchery by piecemeal can, under such circumstances, be\r\nexpected from a man brutal enough at first to 'maim' and 'disable'\r\nhim, and now exasperated by being obliged to pay his full value to the\r\nmaster, and to have, in addition, the daily care and expense of his\r\nmaintenance. Since writing the above, we have seen the following\r\njudicial decision, in the case of Jourdan, vs. Patton--5 Martin's\r\nLouisiana Reports, 615. A slave of the plaintiff had been deprived of\r\nhis _only eye_, and thus rendered _useless_, on which account the\r\ncourt adjudged that the defendant should pay the plaintiff his full\r\nvalue. The case went up, by appeal, to the Supreme court. Judge\r\nMathews, in his decision said, that 'when the defendant had paid the\r\nsum decreed, the slave ought to be placed in his possession,'--adding,\r\nthat 'the judgment making full compensation to the owner _operates a\r\nchange of property_. He adds, 'The principle of humanity which would\r\nlead us to suppose, that the mistress whom he had long served, would\r\ntreat her miserable blind slave with more kindness than the defendant\r\nto whom the judgment ought to transfer him, CANNOT BE TAKEN INTO\r\nCONSIDERATION!' The full compensation of the mistress for the loss of\r\nthe services of the slave, is worthy of all 'consideration,' even to\r\nthe uttermost farthing; 'public opinion' is omnipotent for _her_\r\nprotection; but when the food, clothing, shelter, fire and lodging,\r\nmedicine and nursing, comfort and entire condition and treatment of\r\nher poor blind slave throughout his dreary pilgrimage, is the\r\nquestion--ah! that, says the mouthpiece of the law, and the\r\nrepresentative of 'public opinion,' 'CANNOT BE TAKEN INTO\r\nCONSIDERATION.' Protection of slaves by 'public opinion' among\r\nslaveholders!!\r\n\r\nThe foregoing illustrations of southern 'public opinion,' from the\r\nlaws made by it and embodying it, are sufficient to show, that, so far\r\nfrom being an efficient protection to the slaves, it is their\r\ndeadliest foe, persecutor and tormentor.\r\n\r\nBut here we shall probably be met by the legal lore of some 'Justice\r\nShallow,' instructing us that the life of the slave is fully protected\r\nby law, however unprotected he may be in other respects. This\r\nassertion we meet with a point blank denial. The law does not, in\r\nreality, protect the life of the slave. But even if the letter of the\r\nlaw would fully protect the life of the slave, 'public opinion' in the\r\nslave states would make it a dead letter. The letter of the law would\r\nhave been all-sufficient for the protection of the lives of the\r\nmiserable gamblers in Vicksburg, and other places in Mississippi, from\r\nthe rage of those whose money they had won; but 'gentlemen of property\r\nand standing 'laughed the law to scorn, rushed to the gamblers' house,\r\nput ropes round their necks, dragged them through the streets, hanged\r\nthem in the public square, and thus saved the sum they had not yet\r\npaid. Thousands witnessed this wholesale murder, yet of the scores of\r\nlegal officers present, not a soul raised a finger to prevent it, the\r\nwhole city consented to it, and thus aided and abetted it. How many\r\nhundreds of them helped to commit the murders, _with their own hands_,\r\ndoes not appear, but not one of them has been indicted for it, and no\r\none made the least effort to bring them to trial. Thus, up to the\r\npresent hour, the blood of those murdered men rests on that whole\r\ncity, and it will continue to be a CITY OF MURDERERS, so long as its\r\ncitizens, agree together to shield those felons from punishment; and\r\nthey do thus agree together so long as they encourage each other in\r\nrefusing to bring them to justice. Now, the _laws_ of Mississippi were\r\nnot in fault that those men were murdered; nor are they now in fault,\r\nthat their murderers are not punished; the laws demand it, but the\r\npeople of Mississippi, the legal officers, the grand juries and\r\nlegislature of the state, with one consent agree, that the law _shall\r\nbe a dead letter_, and thus the whole state assumes the guilt of those\r\nmurders, and in bravado, flourishes her reeking hands in the face of\r\nthe world.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: We have just learned from Mississippi papers, that the\r\ncitizens of Vicksburg are erecting a public monument in honor of Dr.\r\nH.S. Bodley, who was the ring-leader of the Lynchers in their attack\r\nupon the miserable victims. To give the crime the cold encouragement\r\nof impunity alone, or such slight tokens of favor as a home and a\r\nsanctuary, is beneath the chivalry and hospitality of Mississippians;\r\nso they tender it incense, an altar, and a crown of glory. Let the\r\nmarble rise till it be seen from afar, a beacon marking the spot where\r\nlaw lies lifeless by the hand of felons; and murderers, with chaplets\r\non their heads, dance and shout upon its grave, while 'all the people\r\nsay, amen.']\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter of the law on the statute book is one thing, the practice\r\nof the community under that law often a totally different thing. Each\r\nof the slave states has laws providing that the life of no _white_ man\r\nshall be taken without his having first been indicted by a grand jury,\r\nallowed an impartial trial by a petit jury, with the right of counsel,\r\ncross-examination of witnesses, &c.; but who does not know that if\r\nARTHUR TAPPAN were pointed out in the streets of New Orleans, Mobile,\r\nSavannah, Charleston, Natchez, or St. Louis, he would be torn in\r\npieces by the citizens with one accord, and that if any one should\r\nattempt to bring his murderers to punishment, he would be torn in\r\npieces also. The editors of southern newspapers openly vaunt, that\r\nevery abolitionist who sets foot in their soil, shall, if he be\r\ndiscovered, be hung at once, without judge or jury. What mockery to\r\nquote the _letter of the law_ in those states, to show that\r\nabolitionists would have secured to them the legal protection of an\r\nimpartial trial!\r\n\r\nBefore the objector can make out his case, that the life of the slave\r\nis protected by the law, he must not only show that the _words of the\r\nlaw_ grant him such protection, but that such a state of public\r\nsentiment exists as will carry out the provisions of the law in their\r\ntrue spirit. Any thing short of this will be set down as mere prating\r\nby every man of common sense. It has been already abundantly shown in\r\nthe preceding pages, that the public sentiment of the slaveholding\r\nstates toward the slaves is diabolical. Now, if there were laws in\r\nthose states, the _words_ of which granted to the life of the slave\r\nthe same protection granted to that of the master, what would they\r\navail? ACTS constitute protection; and is that public sentiment which\r\nmakes the slave 'property,' and perpetrates hourly robbery and\r\nbatteries upon him, so penetrated with a sense of the sacredness of\r\nhis right to life, that it will protect it at all hazards, and drag to\r\nthe gallows his OWNER, if he take the life of his own _property_? If\r\nit be asked, why the penalty for killing a slave is not a mere _fine_\r\nthen, if his life is not really regarded as sacred by public\r\nsentiment--we answer, that formerly in most, if not in all the slave\r\nstates, the murder of a slave _was_ punished by a mere fine. This was\r\nthe case in South Carolina till a few years since. Yes, as late as\r\n1821, in the state of South Carolina, which boasts of its chivalry and\r\nhonor, at least as loudly as any state in the Union, a slaveholder\r\nmight butcher his slave in the most deliberate manner--with the most\r\nbarbarous and protracted torments, and yet not be subjected to a\r\nsingle hour's imprisonment--pay his fine, stride out of the court and\r\nkill another--pay his fine again and butcher another, and so long as\r\nhe paid to the state, cash down, its own assessment of damages,\r\nwithout putting it to the trouble of prosecuting for it, he might\r\nstrut 'a gentleman.'--See 2 _Brevard's Digest_, 241.\r\n\r\nThe reason assigned by the legislature for enacting a law which\r\npunished the wilful murder of a human being by a _fine_, was that\r\n'CRUELTY _is_ HIGHLY UNBECOMING,' and 'ODIOUS.' It was doubtless the\r\nsame reason that induced the legislature in 1821, to make a show of\r\ngiving _more_ protection to the life of the slave. Their fathers, when\r\nthey gave _some_ protection, did it because the time had come when,\r\nnot to do it would make them 'ODIOUS,' So the legislature of 1821 made\r\na show of giving still greater protection, because, not to do it would\r\nmake them '_odious_.' Fitly did they wear the mantles of their\r\nascending fathers! In giving to the life of a slave the miserable\r\nprotection of a fine, their fathers did not even pretend to do it out\r\nof any regard to the sacredness of his life as a human being, but\r\nmerely because cruelty is 'unbecoming' and 'odious.' The legislature\r\nof 1821 _nominally_ increased this protection; not that they cared\r\nmore for the slave's rights, or for the inviolabity of his life as a\r\nhuman being, but the civilized world had advanced since the date of\r\nthe first law. The slave-trade which was then honorable merchandise,\r\nand plied by lords, governors, judges, and doctors of divinity,\r\nraising them to immense wealth, had grown 'unbecoming,' and only\r\nraised its votaries by a rope to the yard arm; besides this, the\r\nbarbarity of the slave codes throughout the world was fast becoming\r\n'odious' to civilized nations, and slaveholders found that the only\r\nconditions on which they could prevent themselves from being thrust\r\nout of the pale of civilization, was to meliorate the iron rigor of\r\ntheir slave code, and thus _seem_ to secure to their slaves some\r\nprotection. Further, the northern states had passed laws for the\r\nabolition of slavery--all the South American states were acting in the\r\nmatter; and Colombia and Chili passed acts of abolition that very\r\nyear. In addition to all this the Missouri question had been for two\r\nyears previous under discussion in Congress, in State legislatures,\r\nand in every village and stage coach; and this law of South Carolina\r\nhad been held up to execration by northern members of Congress, and in\r\nnewspapers throughout the free states--in a word, the legislature of\r\nSouth Carolina found that they were becoming 'odious;' and while in\r\ntheir sense of justice and humanity they did not surpass their\r\nfathers, they winced with equal sensitiveness under the sting of the\r\nworld's scorn, and with equal promptitude sued for a truce by\r\nmodifying the law.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of South Carolina modified another law at the same\r\nsession. Previously, the killing of a slave 'on a sudden heat or\r\npassion, or by undue correction,' was punished by a fine of three\r\nhundred and fifty pounds. In 1821 an act was passed diminishing the\r\nfine to five hundred dollars, but authorizing an imprisonment 'not\r\nexceeding six months.' Just before the American Revolution, the\r\nLegislature of North Carolina passed a law making _imprisonment_ the\r\npenalty for the wilful and malicious murder of a slave. About twenty\r\nyears after the revolution, the state found itself becoming 'odious,'\r\nas the spirit of abolition was pervading the nations. The legislature,\r\nperceiving that Christendom would before long rank them with\r\nbarbarians if they so cheapened human life, repealed the law, candidly\r\nassigning in the preamble of the new one the reason for repealing the\r\nold--that it was 'DISGRACEFUL' and 'DEGRADING! As this preamble\r\nexpressly recognizes the slave as 'a human creature,' and as it is\r\ncouched in a phraseology which indicates some sense of justice, we\r\nwould gladly give the legislature credit for sincerity, and believe\r\nthem really touched with humane movings towards the slave, were it not\r\nfor a proviso in the law clearly revealing that the show of humanity\r\nand regard for their rights, indicated by the words, is nothing more\r\nthan a hollow pretence--hypocritical flourish to produce an impression\r\nfavorable to their justice and magnanimity. After declaring that he\r\nwho is 'guilty of wilfully and maliciously killing a slave, shall\r\nsuffer the same punishment as if he had killed a freeman;' the act\r\nconcludes thus: 'Provided, always, this act shall not extend to the\r\nperson killing a slave outlawed by virtue of any act of Assembly of\r\nthis state; or to any slave in the act of resistance to his lawful\r\noverseer, or master, or to any slave dying under _moderate\r\ncorrection_.' Reader, look at this proviso. 1. It gives free license\r\nto all persons to kill _outlawed slaves_. Well, what is an outlawed\r\nslave? A slave who runs away, lurks in swamps, &c., and kills a _hog_\r\nor any other domestic animal to keep himself from starving, is subject\r\nto a proclamation of _outlawry_; (Haywood's Manual, 521,) and then\r\nwhoever finds him may shoot him, tear him in pieces with dogs, burn\r\nhim to death over a slow fire, or kill him by any other tortures. 2.\r\nThe proviso grants full license to a master to kill his slave, if the\r\nslave _resist_ him. The North Carolina Bench has decided that this law\r\ncontemplates not only actual resistance to punishment, &c., but also\r\n_offering_ to resist. (Stroud's Sketch, 37.) If, for example, a slave\r\nundergoing the process of branding should resist by pushing aside the\r\nburning stamp; or if wrought up to frenzy by the torture of the lash,\r\nhe should catch and hold it fast; or if he break loose from his master\r\nand run, refusing to stop at his command; or if he _refuse_ to be\r\nflogged; or struggle to keep his clothes on while his master is trying\r\nto strip him; if, in these, or any one of a hundred other ways he\r\n_resist_, or offer, or _threaten_ to resist the infliction; or, if the\r\nmaster attempt the violation of the slave's wife, and the husband\r\nresist his attempts without the least effort to injure him, but merely\r\nto shield his wife from his assaults, this law does not merely permit,\r\nbut it _authorizes_ the master to murder the slave on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe brutality of these two provisos brands its authors as barbarians.\r\nBut the third cause of exemption could not be outdone by the\r\nlegislation of fiends. 'DYING under MODERATE _correction_!' MODERATE\r\n_correction_ and DEATH--cause and effect! 'Provided ALWAYS,' says the\r\nlaw, 'this act shall not extend to any slave dying under _moderate\r\ncorrection_!' Here is a formal proclamation of impunity to murder--an\r\nexpress pledge of _acquittal_ to all slaveholders who wish to murder\r\ntheir slaves, a legal absolution--an indulgence granted before the\r\ncommission of the crime! Look at the phraseology. Nothing is said of\r\nmaimings, dismemberments, skull fractures, of severe bruisings, or\r\nlacerations, or even of floggings; but a word is used the\r\ncommon-parlance import of which is, _slight chastisement_; it is not\r\neven _whipping_, but '_correction_' And as if hypocrisy and malignity\r\nwere on the rack to outwit each other, even that weak word must be\r\nstill farther diluted; so '_moderate_' is added: and, to crown the\r\nclimax, compounded of absurdity, hypocrisy, and cold-blooded murder,\r\nthe _legal definition_ of 'moderate correction' is covertly given;\r\nwhich is, _any punishment_ that KILLS the victim. All inflictions are\r\neither _moderate_ or _immoderate_; and the design of this law was\r\nmanifestly to shield the murderer from conviction, _by carrying on its\r\nface the rule for its own interpretation_; thus advertising,\r\nbeforehand, courts and juries, that the fact of any infliction\r\n_producing death_, was no evidence that it was _immoderate_, and that\r\nbeating a man to death came within the legal meaning of 'moderate\r\ncorrection!' The _design_ of the legislature of North Carolina in\r\nframing this law is manifest; it was to produce the impression upon\r\nthe world, that they had so high a sense of justice as voluntarily to\r\ngrant adequate protection to the lives of their slaves. This is\r\nostentatiously set forth in the preamble, and in the body of the law.\r\nThat this was the most despicable hypocrisy, and that they had\r\npredetermined to grant no such protection, notwithstanding the pains\r\ntaken to get the _credit_ of it, is fully revealed by the _proviso_,\r\nwhich was framed in such a way as to nullify the law, for the express\r\naccommodation of slaveholding gentlemen murdering their slaves. All\r\nsuch find in this proviso a convenient accomplice before the fact, and\r\na packed jury, with a ready-made verdict of 'not guilty,' both\r\ngratuitously furnished by the government! The preceding law and\r\nproviso are to be found in Haywood's Manual, 530; also in Laws of\r\nTennessee, Act of October 23, 1791; and in Stroud's Sketch, 37.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said already to show, that though the laws of the\r\nslave states profess to grant adequate protection to the life of the\r\nslave, such professions are mere empty pretence, no such protection\r\nbeing in reality afforded by them. But there is still another fact,\r\nshowing that all laws which profess to protect the slaves from injury\r\nby the whites are a mockery. It is this--that the testimony, neither\r\nof a slave nor of a free colored person, is _legal_ testimony against\r\na white. To this rule there is _no exception_ in any of the slave\r\nstates: and this, were there no other evidence, would be sufficient to\r\nstamp, as hypocritical, all the provisions of the codes which\r\n_profess_ to protect the slaves. Professing to grant _protection_,\r\nwhile, at the same time, it strips them of the only _means_ by which\r\nthey can make that protection available! Injuries must be legally\r\n_proved_ before they can be legally _redressed_: to deprive men of the\r\npower of _proving_ their injuries, is itself the greatest of all\r\ninjuries; for it not only exposes to all, but invites them, by a\r\nvirtual guarantee of impunity, and is thus the _author_ of all\r\ninjuries. It matters not what other laws exist, professing to throw\r\nsafeguards round the slave--_this_ makes them blank paper. How can a\r\nslave prove outrages perpetrated upon him by his master or overseer,\r\nwhen his own testimony and that of all his fellow-slaves, his kindred,\r\nassociates, and acquaintances, is ruled out of court? and when he is\r\nentirely in the _power_ of those who injure him, and when the only\r\ncare necessary, on their part, is, to see that no _white_ witness is\r\nlooking on. Ordinarily, but _one_ white man, the overseer, is with the\r\nslaves while they are at labor; indeed, on most plantations, to commit\r\nan outrage in the _presence_ of a white witness would be more\r\ndifficult than in their absence. He who wished to commit an illegal\r\nact upon a slave, instead of being obliged to _take pains_ and watch\r\nfor an opportunity to do it unobserved by a white, would find it\r\ndifficult to do it in the presence of a white if he wished to do so.\r\nThe supreme court of Louisiana, in their decision, in the case of\r\nCrawford vs. Cherry,(15, _Martin's La. Rep._ 112; also \"_Law of\r\nSlavery,_\" 249,) where the defendant was sued for the value of a slave\r\nwhom he had shot and killed, say, \"The act charged here, is one\r\n_rarely_ committed in the presence of _witnesses_,\" (whites). So in\r\nthe case of the State vs. Mann, (_Devereux, N.C. Rep._ 263; and _\"Law\r\nof Slavery,\" _247;) in which the defendant was charged with shooting a\r\nslave girl 'belonging' to the plaintiff; the Supreme Court of North\r\nCarolina, in their decision, speaking of the provocations of the\r\nmaster by the slave, and 'the consequent wrath of the master'\r\nprompting him to _bloody vengeance_, add, _'a vengeance generally\r\npractised with impunity, by reason of its privacy.'_\r\n\r\nLaws excluding the testimony of slaves and free colored persons, where\r\na white is concerned, do not exist in all the slave states. One or two\r\nof them have no legal enactment on the subject; but, in those,\r\n_'public opinion'_ acts with the force of law, and the courts\r\n_invariably reject it_. This brings us back to the potency of that\r\noft-quoted 'public opinion,' so ready, according to our objector, to\r\ndo battle for the _protection_ of the slave!\r\n\r\nAnother proof that 'public opinion,' in the slave states, plunders,\r\ntortures, and murders the slaves, instead of _protecting_ them, is\r\nfound in the fact, that the laws of slave states inflict _capital_\r\npunishment on slaves for a variety of crimes, for which, if their\r\nmasters commit them, the legal penalty is merely _imprisonment_. Judge\r\nStroud in his Sketch of the Laws of Slavery, says, that by the laws of\r\nVirginia, there are 'seventy-one crimes for which slaves are capitally\r\npunished though in none of these are whites punished in manner more\r\nsevere than by imprisonment in the penitentiary.' (P. 107, where the\r\nreader will find all the crimes enumerated.) It should be added,\r\nhowever, that though the penalty for each of these seventy-one crimes\r\nis 'death,' yet a majority of them are, in the words of the law,\r\n'death within clergy;' and in Virginia, _clergyable_ offences, though\r\n_technically_ capital, are not so in fact. In Mississippi, slaves are\r\npunished capitally for more than _thirty_ crimes, for which whites are\r\npunished only by fine or imprisonment, or both. Eight of these are not\r\n_recognized as crimes_, either by common law or by statute, when\r\ncommitted by whites. In South Carolina slaves are punished capitally\r\nfor _nine_ more crimes than the whites--in Georgia, for _six_--and in\r\nKentucky, for _seven_ more than whites, &c. We surely need not detain\r\nthe reader by comments on this monstrous inequality with which the\r\npenal codes of slave states treat slaves and their masters. When we\r\nconsider that guilt is in proportion to intelligence, and that these\r\nmasters have by law doomed their slaves to ignorance, and then, as\r\nthey darkle and grope along their blind way, inflict penalties upon\r\nthem for a variety of acts regarded as praise worthy in whites;\r\nkilling them for crimes, when whites are only fined or imprisoned--to\r\ncall such a 'public opinion' inhuman, savage, murderous, diabolical,\r\nwould be to use tame words, if the English vocabulary could supply\r\nothers of more horrible import.\r\n\r\nBut slaveholding brutality does not stop here. While punishing the\r\nslaves for crimes with vastly greater severity than it does their\r\nmasters for the same crimes, and making a variety of acts _crimes_ in\r\nlaw, which are right, and often _duties_, it persists in refusing to\r\nmake known to the slaves that complicated and barbarous penal code\r\nwhich loads them with such fearful liabilities. The slave is left to\r\nget a knowledge of these laws as he can, and cases must be of constant\r\noccurrence at the south, in which slaves get their first knowledge of\r\nthe existence of a law by suffering its penalty. Indeed, this is\r\nprobably the way in which they commonly learn what the laws are; for\r\nhow else can the slave get a knowledge of the laws? He cannot\r\n_read_--he cannot _learn_ to read; if he try to master the alphabet,\r\nso that he may spell out the words of the law, and thus avoid its\r\npenalties, the law shakes its terrors at him; while, at the same time,\r\nthose who made the laws refuse to make them known to those for whom\r\nthey are designed. The memory of Caligula will blacken with execration\r\nwhile time lasts, because be hung up his laws so high that people\r\ncould not read them, and then punished them because they did not keep\r\nthem. Our slaveholders aspire to blacker infamy. Caligula was content\r\nwith hanging up his laws where his subjects could _see_ them; and if\r\nthey could not read them, they knew where they were, and might get at\r\nthem, if, in their zeal to learn his will, they had used the same\r\nmeans to get up to them that those did who hung them there. Even\r\nCaligula, wretch as he was, would have shuddered at cutting their legs\r\noff, to prevent their climbing to them; or, if they had got there, at\r\nboring their eyes out, to prevent their reading them. Our slaveholders\r\nvirtually do both; for they prohibit their slaves acquiring that\r\nknowledge of letters which would enable them to read the laws; and if,\r\nby stealth, they get it in spite of them, they prohibit them books and\r\npapers, and flog them if they are caught at them. Further--Caligula\r\nmerely hung his laws so high that they could not be _read_--our\r\nslaveholders have hung theirs so high above the slave that they cannot\r\nbe _seen_--they are utterly out of sight, and he finds out that they\r\nare there only by the falling of the penalties on his head.[35] Thus\r\nthe \"public opinion\" of slave states protects the defenceless slave by\r\narming a host of legal penalties and setting them in ambush at every\r\nthicket along his path, to spring upon him unawares.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The following extract from the Alexandria (D.C.) Gazette\r\nis all illustration. \"CRIMINALS CONDEMNED.--On Monday last the Court\r\nof the borough of Norfolk, Va. sat on the trial of four negro boys\r\narraigned for burglary. The first indictment charged them with\r\nbreaking into the hardware store of Mr. E.P. Tabb, upon which two of\r\nthem were found guilty by the Court, and condemned to suffer the\r\npenalty of the law, which, in the case of a slave, is death. The\r\nsecond Friday in April is appointed for the execution of their awful\r\nsentence. _Their ages do not exceed sixteen_. The first, a fine active\r\nboy, belongs to a widow lady in Alexandria; the latter, a house\r\nservant, is owned by a gentleman in the borough. The value of one was\r\nfixed at $1000, and the other at $800; which sums are to be\r\nre-imbursed to their respective owners out of the state treasury.\" In\r\nall probability these poor boys, who are to be hung for stealing,\r\nnever dreamed that death was the legal penalty of the crime.\r\n\r\nHere is another, from the \"New Orleans Bee\" of ---- 14, 1837--\"The\r\nslave who STRUCK some citizens in Canal street, some weeks since, has\r\nbeen tried and found guilty, and is sentenced to be HUNG on the 24th.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nStroud, in his Sketch of the Laws of Slavery, page 100, thus comments\r\non this monstrous barbarity.\r\n\r\n\"The hardened convict moves their sympathy, and is to be taught the\r\nlaws before he is expected to obey them;[36] yet the guiltless slave\r\nis subjected to an extensive system of cruel enactments, of no part of\r\nwhich, probably, has he ever heard.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: \"It shall be the duty of the keeper [of the penitentiary]\r\non the receipt of each prisoner, to _read_ to him or her such parts of\r\nthe penal laws of this state as impose penalties for escape, and to\r\nmake all the prisoners in the penitentiary acquainted with the same.\r\nIt shall also be his duty, on the discharge of such prisoner, to read\r\nto him or her such parts of the laws as impose additional punishments\r\nfor the repetition of offences.\"--_Rule 12th_, for the internal\r\ngovernment of the Penitentiary of Georgia. Sec. 26 of the Penitentiary\r\nAct of 1816.--Prince's Digest, 386.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving already drawn so largely on the reader's patience, in\r\nillustrating southern 'public opinion' by the slave laws, instead of\r\nadditional illustrations of the same point from another class of those\r\nlaws, as was our design, we will group together a few particulars,\r\nwhich the reader can take in at a glance, showing that the \"public\r\nopinion\" of slaveholders towards their slaves, which exists at the\r\nsouth, in the form of law, tramples on all those fundamental\r\nprinciples of right, justice, and equity, which are recognized as\r\nsacred by all civilized nations, and receive the homage even of\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\n1. One of these principles is, that the _benefits_ of law to the\r\nsubject should overbalance its burdens--its protection more than\r\ncompensate for its restraints and exactions--and its blessings\r\naltogether outweigh its inconveniences and evils--the former being\r\nnumerous, positive, and permanent, the latter few, negative, and\r\nincidental. Totally the reverse of all this is true in the case of the\r\nslave. Law is to him all exaction and no protection: instead of\r\nlightening his _natural_ burdens, it crushes him under a multitude of\r\nartificial ones; instead of a friend to succor him, it is his\r\ndeadliest foe, transfixing him at every step from the cradle to the\r\ngrave. Law has been beautifully defined to be \"benevolence acting by\r\nrule;\" to the American slave it is malevolence torturing by system. It\r\nis an old truth, that _responsibility_ increases with _capacity_; but\r\nthose same laws which make the slave a \"_chattel_,\" require of him\r\n_more_ than of _men_. The same law which makes him a _thing_ incapable\r\nof obligation, loads him with obligations superhuman--while sinking\r\nhim below the level of a brute in dispensing its _benefits_, he lays\r\nupon him burdens which would break down an angel.\r\n\r\n2. _Innocence is entitled to the protection of law._ Slaveholders make\r\ninnocence free plunder; this is their daily employment; their laws\r\nassail it, make it their victim, inflict upon it all, and, in some\r\nrespects, more than all the penalties of the greatest guilt. To other\r\ninnocent persons, law is a blessing, to the slave it is a curse, only\r\na curse and that continually.\r\n\r\n3. _Deprivation of liberty is one of the highest punishments of\r\ncrime_; and in proportion to its justice when inflicted on the guilty,\r\nis its injustice when inflicted on the innocent; this terrible penalty\r\nis inflicted on two million seven hundred thousand, innocent persons\r\nin the Southern states.\r\n\r\n4. _Self-preservation and self-defence_, are universally regarded as\r\nthe most sacred of human rights, yet the laws of slave states punish\r\nthe slave with _death_ for exercising these rights in that way, which\r\nin others is pronounced worthy of the highest praise.\r\n\r\n5. _The safeguards of law are most needed where natural safe-guards\r\nare weakest._ Every principle of justice and equity requires, that,\r\nthose who are totally unprotected by birth, station, wealth, friends,\r\ninfluence, and popular favor, and especially those who are the\r\ninnocent objects of public contempt and prejudice, should be more\r\nvigilantly protected by law, than those who are so fortified by\r\ndefence, that they have far less need of _legal_ protection; yet the\r\npoor slave who is fortified by _none_ of these _personal_ bulwarks, is\r\ndenied the protection of law, while the master, surrounded by them\r\nall, is panoplied in the mail of legal protection, even to the hair of\r\nhis head; yea, his very shoe-tie and coat-button are legal protegees.\r\n\r\n6. The grand object of law is to _protect men's natural rights_, but\r\ninstead of protecting the natural rights of the slaves, it gives\r\nslaveholders license to wrest them from the weak by violence, protects\r\nthem in holding their plunder, and _kills_ the rightful owner if he\r\nattempt to recover it.\r\n\r\nThis is the _protection_ thrown around the rights of American slaves\r\nby the 'public opinion,' of slaveholders; these the restraints that\r\nhold back their masters, overseers, and drivers, from inflicting\r\ninjuries upon them!\r\n\r\nIn a Republican government, _law_ is the pulse of its _heart_--as the\r\nheart beats the pulse beats, except that it often beats _weaker_ than\r\nthe heart, never stronger--or to drop the figure, laws are never\r\n_worse_ than those who make them, very often better. If human history\r\nproves anything, cruelty of practice will always go beyond cruelty of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nLaw-making is a formal, deliberate act, performed by persons of mature\r\nage, embodying the intelligence, wisdom, justice and humanity, of the\r\ncommunity; performed, too, at leisure, after full opportunity had for\r\na comprehensive survey of all the relations to be affected, after\r\ncareful investigation and protracted discussion. Consequently laws\r\nmust, in the main, be a true index of the permanent feelings, the\r\nsettled _frame of mind_, cherished by the community upon those\r\nsubjects, and towards those persons and classes whose condition the\r\nlaws are designed to establish. If the laws are in a high degree cruel\r\nand inhuman, towards any class of persons, it proves that the feelings\r\nhabitually exercised towards that class of persons, by those who make\r\nand perpetuate those laws, are at least _equally_ cruel and inhuman.\r\nWe say _at least equally_ so; for if the _habitual_ state of feeling\r\ntowards that class be unmerciful, it must be unspeakably cruel,\r\nrelentless and malignant when _provoked_; if its _ordinary_ action is\r\ninhuman, its contortions and spasms must be tragedies; if the waves\r\nrun high when there has been no wind, where will they not break when\r\nthe tempest heaves them!\r\n\r\nFurther, when cruelty is the _spirit_ of the law towards a proscribed\r\nclass, when it _legalizes great outrages_ upon them, it connives at,\r\nand abets _greater_ outrages, and is virtually an accomplice of all\r\nwho perpetrate them. Hence, in such cases, though the _degree_ of the\r\noutrage is illegal, the perpetrator will rarely be convicted, and,\r\neven if convicted, will be almost sure to escape punishment. This is\r\nnot _theory_ but _history_. Every judge and lawyer in the slave states\r\n_knows_, that the legal conviction and _punishment_ of masters and\r\nmistresses, for illegal outrages upon their slaves, is an event which\r\nhas rarely, if ever, occurred in the slave states; they know, also,\r\nthat although _hundreds_ of slaves have been _murdered_ by their\r\nmasters and mistresses in the slave states, within the last\r\ntwenty-five years, and though the fact of their having committed those\r\nmurders has been established beyond a _doubt_ in the minds of the\r\nsurrounding community, yet that the murderers have not, in a single\r\ninstance, suffered the penalty of the law.\r\n\r\nFinally, since slaveholders have deliberately legalized the\r\nperpetration of the most cold-blooded atrocities upon their slaves,\r\nand do pertinaciously refuse to make these atrocities _illegal_, and\r\nto punish those who perpetrate them, they stand convicted before the\r\nworld, upon their own testimony, of the most barbarous, brutal, and\r\nhabitual inhumanity. If this be slander and falsehood, their own lips\r\nhave uttered it, their own fingers have written it, their own acts\r\nhave proclaimed it; and however it may be with their _morality_, they\r\nhave too much human nature to perjure themselves for the sake of\r\npublishing their own infamy.\r\n\r\nHaving dwelt at such length on the legal code of the slave states,\r\nthat unerring index of the public opinion of slaveholders towards\r\ntheir slaves; and having shown that it does not protect the slaves\r\nfrom cruelty, and that even in the few instances in which the letter\r\nof the law, if _executed_, would afford some protection, it is\r\nvirtually nullified by the connivance of courts and juries, or by\r\npopular clamor; we might safely rest the case here, assured that every\r\nhonest reader would spurn the absurd falsehood, that the 'public\r\nopinion' of the slave states protects the slaves and restrains the\r\nmaster. But, as the assertion is made so often by slaveholders, and\r\nwith so much confidence, notwithstanding its absurdity is fully\r\nrevealed by their own legal code, we propose to show its falsehood by\r\napplying other tests.\r\n\r\nWe lay it down as a truth that can be made no plainer by reasoning,\r\nthat the same 'public opinion,' which restrains men from _committing_\r\noutrages, will restrain them from _publishing_ such outrages, if they\r\ndo commit them;--in other words, if a man is restrained from certain\r\nacts through fear of losing his character, should they become known,\r\nhe will not voluntarily destroy his character by _making them known_,\r\nshould he be guilty of them. Let us look at this. It is assumed by\r\nslaveholders, that 'public opinion' at the south so frowns on cruelty\r\nto the slaves, that _fear of disgrace_ would restrain from the\r\ninfliction of it, were there no other consideration.\r\n\r\nNow, that this is sheer fiction is shown by the fact, that the\r\nnewspapers in the slaveholding states, teem with advertisements for\r\nrunaway slaves, in which the masters and _mistresses_ describe their\r\nmen and women, as having been 'branded with a hot iron,' on their\r\n'cheeks,' 'jaws,' 'breasts,' 'arms,' 'legs,' and 'thighs;' also as\r\n'scarred,' 'very much scarred,' 'cut up,' 'marked,' &c. 'with the\r\nwhip,' also with 'iron collars on,' 'chains,' 'bars of iron,'\r\n'fetters,' 'bells,' 'horns,' 'shackles,' &c. They, also, describe them\r\nas having been wounded by 'buck-shot,' 'rifle-balls,' &c. fired at\r\nthem by their 'owners,' and others when in pursuit; also, as having\r\n'notches,' cut in their ears, the tops or bottoms of their ears 'cut\r\noff,' or 'slit,' or 'one ear cut off' or 'both ears cut off' &c. &c.\r\nThe masters and mistresses who thus advertise their runaway slaves,\r\ncoolly sign their names to their advertisements, giving the street and\r\nnumber of their residences, if in cities, their post office address,\r\n&c. if in the country; thus making public proclamation as widely as\r\npossible that _they_ 'brand,' 'scar,' 'gash,' 'cut up,' &c. the flesh\r\nof their slaves; load them with irons, cut off their ears, &c.; they\r\nspeak of these things with the utmost _sang froid_, not seeming to\r\nthink it possible, that any one will esteem them at all the less\r\nbecause of these outrages upon their slaves; further, these\r\nadvertisements swarm in many of the largest and most widely circulated\r\npolitical and commercial papers that are published in the slave\r\nstates. The editors of those papers constitute the main body of the\r\nliterati of the slave states; they move in the highest circle of\r\nsociety, are among the 'popular' men in the community, and _as a\r\nclass_, are more influential than any other; yet these editors publish\r\nthese advertisements with iron indifference. So far from proclaiming\r\nto such felons, homicides, and murderers, that they will not be their\r\nblood-hounds, to hunt down the innocent and mutilated victims who have\r\nescaped from their torture, they freely furnish them with every\r\nfacility, become their accomplices and share their spoils; and instead\r\nof outraging 'public opinion,' by doing it, they are the men after its\r\nown heart, its organs, its representatives, its _self_.\r\n\r\nTo show that the 'public opinion' of the slave states, towards the\r\nslaves, is absolutely _diabolical_, we will insert a few, out of a\r\nmultitude, of similar advertisements from a variety of southern papers\r\nnow before us.\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Standard, of July 18, 1838, contains the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\"TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD. Ranaway from the subscriber, a negro woman and\r\ntwo children; the woman is tall and black, and _a few days before she\r\nwent off_, I BURNT HER WITH A HOT IRON ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HER FACE; I\r\nTRIED TO MAKE THE LETTER M, _and she kept a cloth over her head and\r\nface, and a fly bonnet on her head so as to cover the burn;_ her\r\nchildren are both boys, the oldest is in his seventh year; he is a\r\n_mulatto_ and has blue eyes; the youngest is black and is in his fifth\r\nyear. The woman's name is Betty, commonly called Bet.\"\r\n\r\nMICAJAH RICKS.\r\n\r\n_Nash County, July 7_, 1838.\r\n\r\nHear the wretch tell his story, with as much indifference as if he\r\nwere describing the cutting of his initials in the bark of a tree.\r\n\r\n_\"I burnt her with a hot iron on the left side of her face,\"--\"I tried\r\nto make the letter M_,\" and this he says in a newspaper, and puts his\r\nname to it, and the editor of the paper who is, also, its proprietor,\r\npublishes it for him and pockets his fee. Perhaps the reader will say,\r\n'Oh, it must have been published in an insignificant sheet printed in\r\nsome obscure corner of the state; perhaps by a gang of 'squatters,' in\r\nthe Dismal Swamp, universally regarded as a pest, and edited by some\r\nscape-gallows, who is detested by the whole community.' To this I reply\r\nthat the \"North Carolina Standard,\" the paper which contains it, is a\r\nlarge six columned weekly paper, handsomely printed and ably edited;\r\nit is the leading Democratic paper in that state, and is published at\r\nRaleigh, the Capital of the state, Thomas Loring, Esq. Editor and\r\nProprietor. The motto in capitals under the head of the paper is, \"THE\r\nCONSTITUTION AND THE UNION OF THE STATES--THEY MUST BE PRESERVED.\" The\r\nsame Editor and Proprietor, who exhibits such brutality of feeling\r\ntowards the slaves, by giving the preceding advertisement a\r\nconspicuous place in his columns, and taking his pay for it, has\r\napparently a keen sense of the proprieties of life, where _whites_ are\r\nconcerned, and a high regard for the rights, character and feelings of\r\nthose whose skin is colored like his own. As proof of this, we copy\r\nfrom the number of the paper containing the foregoing advertisement,\r\nthe following _Editorial_ on the pending political canvass.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot refrain from expressing the hope that the Gubernatorial\r\ncanvass will be conducted with a _due regard to the character_, and\r\n_feelings_ of the distinguished individuals who are candidates for\r\nthat office; and that the press of North Carolina will _set an\r\nexample_ in this respect, worthy of _imitation and of praise_.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is this but chivalrous and honorable feeling? The good name of\r\nNorth Carolina is dear to him--on the comfort, 'character and\r\nfeelings,' of her _white_ citizens he sets a high value; he feels too,\r\nmost deeply for the _character of the Press_ of North Carolina, sees\r\nthat it is a city set on a hill, and implores his brethren of the\r\neditorial corps to 'set an example' of courtesy and magnanimity worthy\r\nof imitation and praise. Now, reader, put all these things together\r\nand con them over, and then read again the preceding advertisement\r\ncontained in the same number of the paper, and you have the true\r\n\"North Carolina STANDARD,\" by which to measure the protection extended\r\nto slaves by the 'public opinion' of that state.\r\n\r\nJ.P. Ashford advertises as follows in the \"Natchez Courier,\" August\r\n24, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"Ranaway, a negro girl called Mary, has a small scar over her eye, a\r\n_good many teeth missing_, the letter A. _is branded on her cheek and\r\nforehead_.\"\r\n\r\nA.B.

She is 16 or 17 years of age, slim\r\nmade, LATELY BRANDED ON THE LEFT CHEEK, THUS, R, AND A PIECE TAKEN OFF\r\nOF HER EAR ON THE SAME SIDE; THE SAME LETTER ON THE INSIDE OF BOTH HER\r\nLEGS.\r\n\r\n\"ABNER ROSS, Fairfield District.\"\r\n\r\nBut instead of filling pages with similar advertisements, illustrating\r\nthe horrible brutality of slaveholders towards their slaves, the\r\nreader is referred to the preceding pages of this work, to the scores\r\nof advertisements written by slaveholders, printed by slaveholders,\r\npublished by slaveholders, in newspapers edited by slaveholders and\r\npatronized by slaveholders; advertisement describing not only men and\r\nboys, but women aged and middle-aged, matrons and girls of tender\r\nyears, their necks chafed with iron collars with prongs, their limbs\r\ngalled with iron rings and chains, and bars of iron, iron hobbles and\r\nshackles, all parts of their persons scarred with the lash, and\r\nbranded with hot irons, and torn with rifle bullets, pistol balls and\r\nbuck shot, and gashed with knives, their eyes out, their ears cut off,\r\ntheir teeth drawn out, and their bones broken. He is referred also to\r\nthe cool and shocking indifference with which these slaveholders,\r\n'gentlemen' and 'ladies,' Reverends, and Honorables, and Excellencies,\r\nwrite and print, and publish and pay, and take money for, and read and\r\ncirculate, and sanction, such infernal barbarity. Let the reader\r\nponder all this, and then lay it to heart, that this is that 'public\r\nopinion' of the slaveholders which protects their slaves from all\r\ninjury, and is an effectual guarantee of personal security.\r\n\r\nHowever far gone a community may be in brutality, something of\r\nprotection may yet be hoped for from its 'public opinion,' if _respect\r\nfor woman_ survive the general wreck; that gone, protection perishes;\r\npublic opinion becomes universal rapine; outrages, once occasional,\r\nbecome habitual; the torture, which was before inflicted only by\r\npassion, becomes the constant product of a _system_, and, instead of\r\nbeing the index of sudden and fierce impulses, is coolly plied as the\r\npermanent means to an end. When _women_ are branded with hot irons on\r\ntheir faces; when iron collars, with prongs, are riveted about their\r\nnecks; when iron rings are fastened upon their limbs, and they are\r\nforced to drag after them chains and fetters; when their flesh is torn\r\nwith whips, and mangled with bullets and shot, and lacerated with\r\nknives; and when those who do such things, are regarded in the\r\ncommunity, and associated with as 'gentlemen' and 'ladies;' to say\r\nthat the 'public opinion' of _such_ a community is a protection to its\r\nvictims, is to blaspheme God, whose creatures they are, cast in his\r\nown sacred image, and dear to him as the apple of his eye.\r\n\r\nBut we are not yet quite ready to dismiss this protector, 'Public\r\nOpinion.' To illustrate the hardened brutality with which slaveholders\r\nregard their slaves, the shameless and apparently unconscious\r\nindecency with which they speak of their female slaves, examine their\r\npersons, and describe them, under their own signatures, in newspapers,\r\nhand-bills, &c. just as they would describe the marks of cattle and\r\nswine, on all parts of their bodies; we will make a few extracts from\r\nsouthern papers. Reader, as we proceed to these extracts, remember our\r\nmotto--'True humanity consists _not_ in a squeamish ear.'\r\n\r\nMr. P. ABDIE, of New Orleans, advertises in the New Orleans Bee, of\r\nJanuary 29, 1838, for one of his female slaves, as follows;\r\n\r\n\"Ranaway, the negro wench named Betsey, aged about 22 years,\r\nhandsome-faced, and good countenance; having the marks of the whip\r\nbehind her neck, and SEVERAL OTHERS ON HER RUMP. The above reward,\r\n($10,) will be given to whoever will bring that wench to P. ABDIE.\"\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Bee, in which the advertisement of this Vandal\r\nappears, is the 'Official Gazette of the State--of the General\r\nCouncil--and of the first and third Municipalities of New Orleans.' It\r\nis the largest, and the most influential paper in the south-western\r\nstates, and perhaps the most ably edited--and has undoubtedly a larger\r\ncirculation than any other. It is a daily paper, of $12 a year, and\r\nits circulation being mainly among the larger merchants, planters, and\r\nprofessional men, it is a fair index of the 'public opinion' of\r\nLouisiana, so far as represented by those classes of persons.\r\nAdvertisements equally gross, indecent, and abominable, or nearly so,\r\ncan be found in almost every number of that paper.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAM ROBINSON, Georgetown, District of Columbia, advertised for\r\nhis slave in the National Intelligencer, of Washington City, Oct. 2,\r\n1837, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Eloped from my residence a young negress, 22 years old, of a\r\nchestnut, or brown color. She has a very singular mark--this mark, to\r\nthe best of my RECOLLECTION, covers a part of her _breasts_, _body_,\r\nand _limbs_; and when her neck and arms are uncovered, is very\r\nperceptible; she has been frequently seen east and south of the\r\nCapitol Square, and is harbored by ill-disposed persons, of every\r\ncomplexion, for her services.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN C. BEASLEY, near Huntsville, Alabama, thus advertises a young\r\ngirl of eighteen, in the Huntsville Democrat, of August 1st, 1837.\r\n\"Ranaway Maria, about 18 years old, _very far advanced with child._\"\r\nHe then offers a reward to any one who will commit this young girl, in\r\nthis condition, _to jail_.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES T. DE JARNETT, Vernon, Autauga co. Alabama, thus advertises\r\na woman in the Pensacola Gazette, July 14, 1838. \"Celia is a _bright_\r\ncopper-colored negress, _fine figure_ and _very smart_. On EXAMINING\r\nHER BACK, you will find marks caused by the whip.\" He closes the\r\nadvertisement, by offering a reward of _five hundred dollars_ to any\r\nperson who will lodge her in _jail_, so that he can get her.\r\n\r\nA person who lives at 124 Chartres street, New Orleans, advertises in\r\nthe 'Bee,' of May 31, for \"the negress Patience, about 28 years old,\r\nhas _large hips_, and is _bow-legged_.\" A Mr. T. CUGGY, in the same\r\npaper, thus describes \"the negress Caroline.\" \"_She has awkward feet,\r\nclumsy ankles, turns out her toes greatly in walking, and has a sore\r\non her left shin_.\"\r\n\r\nIn another, of June 22, Mr. P. BAHI advertises \"Maria, with a clear\r\nwhite complexion, and _double nipple on her right breast_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. CHARLES CRAIGE, of Federal Point, New Hanover co. North Carolina,\r\nin the Wilmington Advertiser, August 11, 1837, offers a reward for his\r\nslave Jane, and says \"_she is far advanced in pregnancy_.\"\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Bulletin, August 18, 1838, advertises \"the negress\r\nMary, aged nineteen, has a scar on her face, walks parrot-toed, and is\r\n_pregnant_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J.G. MUIR, of Grand Gulf, Mississippi, thus advertises a woman in\r\nthe Vicksburg Register, December 5, 1838. \"Ranaway a negro girl--has a\r\nnumber of _black lumps on her breasts, and is in a state of\r\npregnancy_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JACOB BESSON, Donaldsonville, Louisiana, advertises in the New\r\nOrleans Bee, August 7, 1838, \"the negro woman Victorine--she is\r\n_advanced in pregnancy_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J.H.

Georgia, advertises in the Columbus\r\n(Ga.) Enquirer of June 22, 1837--\"My negro woman Patsey, has a stoop\r\nin her walking, occasioned by a _severe burn on her abdomen_.\"\r\n\r\nThe above are a few specimens of the gross details, in describing the\r\npersons of females, of all ages, and the marks upon all parts of their\r\nbodies; proving incontestably, that slaveholders are in the habit not\r\nonly of stripping their female slaves of their clothing, and\r\ninflicting punishment upon their 'shrinking flesh,' but of subjecting\r\ntheir naked persons to the most minute and revolting inspection, and\r\nthen of publishing to the world the results of their examination, as\r\nwell as the scars left by their own inflictions upon them, their\r\nlength, size, and exact position on the body; and all this without\r\nimpairing in the least, the standing in the community of the shameless\r\nwretches who thus proclaim their own abominations. That such things\r\nshould not at all affect the standing of such persons in society, is\r\ncertainly no marvel: how could they affect it, when the same\r\ncommunities enact laws _requiring_ their own legal officers to inspect\r\nminutely the persons and bodily marks of all slaves taken up as\r\nrunaways, and to publish in the newspapers a particular description of\r\nall such marks and peculiarities of their persons, their size,\r\nappearance position on the body, &c. Yea, verily, when the 'public\r\nopinion' of the community, in the solemn form of law, commands\r\njailors, sheriffs, captains of police, &c. to divest of their clothing\r\naged matrons and young girls, minutely examine their naked persons,\r\nand publish the results of their examination--who can marvel, that the\r\nsame 'public opinion' should tolerate the slaveholders themselves, in\r\ndoing the same things to their own property, which they have appointed\r\nlegal officers to do as their proxies.[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: 'As a sample of these laws, we give the following extract\r\nfrom one of the laws of Maryland, where slaveholding 'public opinion'\r\nexists in its mildest form.'\r\n\r\n\"It shall be the duty of the sheriffs of the several counties of this\r\nstate, upon any runaway servant or slave being committed to his\r\ncustody, to cause the same to be advertised, &c. and to make\r\nparticular and minute descriptions of _the person and bodily marks_,\r\nof such runaway.\"--_Laws of Maryland of 1802_, Chap. 96, Sec. 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nThat the sheriffs, jailors, &c. do not neglect this part of their\r\nofficial 'duty,' is plain from the minute description which they give\r\nin the advertisements of marks upon all parts of the persons of\r\nfemales, as well as males; and also from the occasional declaration,\r\n'no scars discoverable on any part,' or 'no marks discoverable _about_\r\nher;' which last is taken from an advertisement in the Milledgeville\r\n(Geo.) Journal, June 26, 1838, signed 'T.S. Denster, Jailor.']\r\n\r\n\r\nThe zeal with which slaveholding '_public opinion_' protects the lives\r\nof the slaves, may be illustrated by the following advertisements,\r\ntaken from a multitude of similar ones in southern papers. To show\r\nthat slaveholding 'public opinion' is the same _now_, that it was half\r\na century ago, we will insert, in the first place, an advertisement\r\npublished in a North Carolina newspaper, Oct. 29, 1785, by W. SKINNER,\r\nthe Clerk of the County of Perquimons, North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"Ten silver dollars reward will be paid for apprehending and\r\ndelivering to me my man Moses, who ran away this morning; or I will\r\ngive five times the sum to any person who will make due proof of his\r\n_being killed_, and never ask a question to know by whom it was done.\"\r\n\r\nW. SKINNER.\r\n\r\n_Perquimons County, N.C. Oct. 29, 1785._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late JOHN PARRISH, of Philadelphia, an eminent minister of the\r\nreligious society of Friends, who traveled through the slave states\r\nabout _thirty-five years_ since, on a religious mission, published on\r\nhis return a pamphlet of forty pages, entitled 'Remarks on the Slavery\r\nof the Black People.' From this work we extract the following\r\nillustrations of 'public opinion' in North and South Carolina and\r\nVirginia at that period.\r\n\r\n\"When I was traveling through North Carolina, a black man, who was\r\noutlawed, being shot by one of his pursuers, and left wounded in the\r\nwoods, they came to an ordinary where I had stopped to feed my horse,\r\nin order to procure a cart to bring the poor wretched object in.\r\nAnother, I was credibly informed, was shot, his head cut off, and\r\ncarried in a bag by the perpetrators of the murder, who received the\r\nreward, which was said to be $200, continental currency, and that his\r\nhead was stuck on a coal house at an iron works in Virginia--and this\r\nfor going to visit his wife at a distance. Crawford gives an account\r\nof a man being gibbetted alive in South Carolina, and the buzzards\r\ncame and picked out his eyes. Another was burnt to death at a stake in\r\nCharleston, surrounded by a multitude of spectators, some of whom were\r\npeople of the _first rank_; ... the poor object was heard to cry, as\r\nlong as he could breathe, 'not guilty--not guilty.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an illustration of the 'public opinion' of South\r\nCarolina about fifty years ago. It is taken from Judge Stroud's Sketch\r\nof the Slave Laws, page 39.\r\n\r\n\"I find in the case of 'the State vs. M'Gee,' I Bay's Reports, 164, it\r\nis said incidentally by Messrs. Pinckney and Ford, counsel for the\r\nstate (of S.C.), 'that the _frequency_ of the offence (_wilful_ murder\r\nof a slave) was owing to the _nature of the punishment_', &c.... This\r\nremark was made in 1791, when the above trial took place. It was made\r\nin a public place--a courthouse--and by men of great personal\r\nrespectability. There can be, therefore, no question as to its\r\n_truth_, and as little of its _notoriety_.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1791 the Grand Jury for the district of Cheraw, S.C. made a\r\n_presentment_, from which the following is an extract.\r\n\r\n\"We, the Grand Jurors of and for the district of Cheraw, do present\r\nthe INEFFICACY of the present punishment for killing negroes, as a\r\ngreat defect in the legal system of this state: and we do earnestly\r\nrecommend to the attention of the legislature, that clause of the\r\nnegro act, which confines the penalty for killing slaves to fine and\r\nimprisonment only: in full confidence, that they will provide some\r\nother _more effectual_ measures to prevent the FREQUENCY of crimes of\r\nthis nature.\"--_Matthew Carey's American Museum, for Feb.\r\n1791_.--Appendix, p. 10.\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of the 'public opinion' of Georgia twelve\r\nyears since. We give it in the strong words of COLONEL STONE, Editor\r\nof the New York Commercial Advertiser. We take it from that paper of\r\nJune 8, 1827.\r\n\r\n\"HUNTING MEN WITH DOGS.-A negro who had absconded from his master, and\r\nfor whom a reward of $100 was offered, has been apprehended and\r\ncommitted to prison in Savannah.

M'Neilly, in company\r\nwith his brother, found the negro driving his master's wagon; they\r\nseized him, and either did, or were about to chastise him, when the\r\nnegro stabbed M'Neilly, so that he died in an hour afterwards. The\r\nnegro was taken before a justice of the peace, who _waved his\r\nauthority_, perhaps through fear, as a crowd of persons had collected\r\nto the number of seventy or eighty, near Mr. People's (the justice)\r\nhouse. _He acted as president of the mob,_ and put the vote, when it\r\nwas decided he should be immediately executed by _being burnt to\r\ndeath_. The sable culprit was led to a tree, and tied to it, and a\r\nlarge quantity of pine knots collected and placed around him, and the\r\nfatal torch applied to the pile, even against the remonstrances of\r\nseveral gentlemen who were present; and the miserable being was in a\r\nshort time burned to ashes.\r\n\r\n\"This is the SECOND negro who has been THUS put to death, without\r\njudge or jury, in this county.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following advertisements, testimony, &c. will show that the\r\nslaveholders of _to-day_ are the _children_ of those who shot, and\r\nhunted with bloodhounds, and burned over slow fires, the slaves of\r\nhalf a century ago; the worthy inheritors of their civilization,\r\nchivalry, and tender mercies.\r\n\r\nThe \"Wilmington (North Carolina) Advertiser\" of July 13, 1838,\r\ncontains the following advertisement.\r\n\r\n\"$100 will be paid to any person who may apprehend and safely confine\r\nin any jail in this state, a certain negro man, named ALFRED.

COLEMAN, J.P. [Seal.]\r\n\r\n\"JAS. JONES, J.P. [Seal.]\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, of April 1836, in the city of St Louis, Missouri, a black\r\nman, named McIntosh who had stabbed an officer, that had arrested him,\r\nwas seized by the multitude, fastened to a tree _in the midst of the\r\ncity_, wood piled around him, and in open day and in the presence of\r\nan immense throng of citizens, he was burned to death. The Alton\r\n(Ill.) Telegraph, in its account of the scene says;\r\n\r\n\"All was silent as death while the executioners were piling wood\r\naround their victim. He said not a word, until feeling that the flames\r\nhad seized upon him. He then uttered an awful howl, attempting to sing\r\nand pray, then hung his head, and suffered in silence, except in the\r\nfollowing instance:--After the flames had surrounded their prey, his\r\neyes burnt out of his head, and his mouth seemingly parched to a\r\ncinder, some one in the crowd, more compassionate than the rest,\r\nproposed to put an end to his misery by shooting him, when it was\r\nreplied, 'that would be of no use, since he was already out of pain.'\r\n'No, no,' said the wretch, 'I am not, I am suffering as much as ever;\r\nshoot me, shoot me.' 'No, no,' said one of the fiends who was standing\r\nabout the sacrifice they were roasting, 'he shall not be shot. _I\r\nwould sooner slacken the fire, if that would increase his misery_;'\r\nand the man who said this was, as we understand, an OFFICER OF\r\nJUSTICE!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis correspondent of a New York paper adds,\r\n\r\n\"The shrieks and groans of the victim were loud and piercing, and to\r\nobserve one limb after another drop into the fire was awful indeed. He\r\nwas about fifteen minutes in dying. I visited the place this morning,\r\nand saw his body, or the remains of it, at the place of execution. He\r\nwas burnt to a crump. His legs and arms were gone, and only a part of\r\nhis head and body were left.\"\r\n\r\nLest this demonstration of 'public opinion' should be regarded as a\r\nsudden impulse merely, not an index of the settled tone of feeling in\r\nthat community, it is important to add, that the Hon. Luke E. Lawless,\r\nJudge of the Circuit Court of Missouri, at a session of that Court in\r\nthe city of St. Louis, some months after the burning of this man,\r\ndecided officially that since the burning of McIntosh was the act,\r\neither directly or by countenance of a _majority_ of the citizens, it\r\nis 'a case which transcends the jurisdiction,' of the Grand Jury! Thus\r\nthe state of Missouri has proclaimed to the world, that the wretches\r\nwho perpetrated that unspeakably diabolical murder, and the thousands\r\nthat stood by consenting to it, were _her representatives_, and the\r\nBench sanctifies it with the solemnity of a judicial decision.\r\n\r\nThe 'New Orleans Post,' of June 7, 1836, publishes the following;\r\n\r\n\"We understand, that a negro man was lately condemned, by the mob, to\r\nbe BURNED OVER A SLOW FIRE, which was put into execution at Grand\r\nGulf, Mississippi, for murdering a black woman, and her master.\"\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY BRADLEY, of Pennyan, N.Y., has furnished us with an extract\r\nof a letter written by a gentleman in Mississippi to his brother in\r\nthat village, detailing the particulars of the preceding transaction.\r\nThe letter is dated Grand Gulf, Miss. August 15, 1836. The extract is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"I left Vicksburg and came to Grand Gulf. This is a fine place\r\nimmediately on the banks of the Mississippi, of something like fifteen\r\nhundred inhabitants in the winter, and at this time, I suppose, there\r\nare not over two hundred white inhabitants, but in the town and its\r\nvicinity there are negroes by thousands. The day I arrived at this\r\nplace there was a man by the name of G---- murdered by a negro man\r\nthat belonged to him. G---- was born and brought up in A----, state of\r\nNew York. His father and mother now live south of A----. He has left a\r\nproperty here, it is supposed, of forty thousand dollars, and no\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\"They took the negro, mounted him on a horse, led the horse under a\r\ntree, put a rope around his neck, raised him up by throwing the rope\r\nover a limb; they then got into a quarrel among themselves; some swore\r\nthat he should be burnt alive; the rope was cut and the negro dropped\r\nto the ground. He immediately jumped to his feet; they then made him\r\nwalk a short distance to a tree; he was then tied fast and a fire\r\nkindled, when another quarrel took place; the fire was pulled away\r\nfrom him when about half dead, and a committee of twelve appointed to\r\nsay in what manner he should be disposed of. They brought in that he\r\nshould then be cut down, his head cut off, his body burned, and his\r\nhead stuck on a pole at the corner of the road in the edge of the\r\ntown. That was done and all parties satisfied!\r\n\r\n\"G---- _owned the negro's wife, and was in the habit of sleeping with\r\nher!_ The negro said he had killed him, and he believed he should be\r\nrewarded in heaven for it.\r\n\r\n\"This is but one instance among many of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nS.S.\"\r\n\r\nWe have received a more detailed account of this transaction from Mr.\r\nWilliam Armstrong, of Putnam, Ohio, through Maj. Horace Nye, of that\r\nplace. Mr. A. who has been for some years employed as captain and\r\nsupercargo of boats descending the river, was at Grand Gulf at the\r\ntime of the tragedy, and _witnessed_ it. It was on the Sabbath.\r\nFrom Mr. Armstrong's statement, it appears that the slave was\r\na man of uncommon intelligence; had the over-sight of a large\r\nbusiness--superintended the purchase of supplies for his master,\r\n&c.--that exasperated by the intercourse of his master with his wife,\r\nhe was upbraiding her one evening, when his master overhearing him,\r\nwent out to quell him, was attacked by the infuriated man and killed\r\non the spot. The name of the master was Green; he was a native of\r\nAuburn, New York, and had been at the south but a few years.\r\n\r\nMr. EZEKIEL BIRDSEYE, of Cornwall, Conn., a gentleman well known and\r\nhighly respected in Litchfield county, who resided a number of years\r\nin South Carolina, gives the following testimony:--\r\n\r\n\"A man by the name of Waters was killed by his slaves, in Newberry\r\nDistrict. Three of them were tried before the court, and ordered to be\r\nburnt. I was but a few miles distant at the time, and conversed with\r\nthose who saw the execution. The slaves were tied to a stake, and\r\npitch pine wood piled around them, to which the fire was communicated.\r\nThousands were collected to witness this barbarous transaction. _Other\r\nexecutions of this kind took place in various parts of the state,\r\nduring my residence in it, from 1818 to 1824_. About three or four\r\nyears ago, a young negro was burnt in Abbeville District, for an\r\nattempt at rape.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1837, there was a rumor of a projected insurrection on\r\nthe Red River, in Louisiana. The citizens forthwith seized and hanged\r\nNINE SLAVES, AND THREE FREE COLORED MEN, WITHOUT TRIAL. A few months\r\nprevious to that transaction, a slave was seized in a similar manner\r\nand publicly burned to death, in Arkansas. In July, 1835, the citizens\r\nof Madison county, Mississippi, were alarmed by rumors of an\r\ninsurrection arrested five slaves and publicly executed them without\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Republican, April 30, 1838, gives the particulars of the\r\ndeliberate murder of a negro man named Tom, a cook on board the\r\nsteamboat Pawnee, on her passage up from New Orleans to St. Louis.\r\nSome of the facts stated by the Republican are the following:\r\n\r\n\"On Friday night, about 10 o'clock, a deaf and dumb German girl was\r\nfound in the storeroom with Tom. The door was locked, and at first Tom\r\ndenied she was there. The girl's father came. Tom unlocked the door,\r\nand the girl was found secreted in the room behind a barrel. The next\r\nmorning some four or five of the deck passengers spoke to the captain\r\nabout it. This was about breakfast time. Immediately after he left the\r\ndeck, a number of the deck passengers rushed upon the negro, bound his\r\narms behind his back and carried him forward to the bow of the boat. A\r\nvoice cried out 'throw him overboard,' and was responded to from every\r\nquarter of the deck--and in an instant he was plunged into the river.\r\nThe whole scene of tying him and throwing him overboard scarcely\r\noccupied _ten minutes_, and was so precipitate that the officers were\r\nunable to interfere in time to save him.\r\n\r\n\"There were between two hundred and fifty and three hundred passengers\r\non board.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole process of seizing Tom, dragging him upon deck, binding his\r\narms behind his back, forcing him to the bow of the boat, and throwing\r\nhim overboard, occupied, the editor informs us, about TEN MINUTES, and\r\nof the two hundred and fifty or three hundred deck passengers, with\r\nperhaps as many cabin passengers, it does not appear that _a single\r\nindividual raised a finger to prevent this deliberate murder_; and the\r\ncry \"throw him overboard,\" was it seems, \"responded to from every\r\nquarter of the deck!\"\r\n\r\nRev. JAMES A. THOME, of Augusta, Ky., son of Arthur Thome, Esq., till\r\nrecently a slaveholder, published five years since the following\r\ndescription of a scene witnessed by him in New Orleans:\r\n\r\n\"In December of 1833, I landed at New Orleans, in the steamer W----.\r\nIt was after night, dark and rainy. The passengers were called out of\r\nthe cabin, from the enjoyment of a fire, which the cold, damp\r\natmosphere rendered very comfortable, by a sudden shout of, 'catch\r\nhim--catch him--catch the negro.' The cry was answered by a hundred\r\nvoices--'Catch him--_kill_ him,' and a rush from every direction\r\ntoward our boat, indicated that the object of pursuit was near. The\r\nnext moment we heard a man plunge into the river, a few paces above\r\nus. A crowd gathered upon the shore, with lamps and stones, and clubs,\r\nstill crying, 'catch him--kill him--catch him--shoot him.'\r\n\r\n\"I soon discovered the poor man. He had taken refuge under the prow of\r\nanother boat, and was standing in the water up to his waist. The\r\nangry vociferation of his pursuers, did not intimidate him. He defied\r\nthem all. 'Don't you _dare_ to come near me, or I will sink you in the\r\nriver.' He was armed with despair. For a moment the mob was palsied by\r\nthe energy of his threatenings. They were afraid to go to him with a\r\nskiff, but a number of them went on to the boat and tried to seize\r\nhim. They threw a noose rope down repeatedly, _that they might pull\r\nhim up by the neck_! but he planted his hand firmly against the boat\r\nand dashed the rope away with his arms. One of them took a long bar of\r\nwood, and leaning over the prow, endeavored to strike him on the head,\r\nThe blow must have shattered the skull, but it did not reach low\r\nenough. The monster raised up the heavy club again and said, 'Come out\r\nnow, you old rascal, or die.' 'Strike,' said the negro;\r\n'strike--shiver my brains _now_; I want to die;' and down went the\r\nclub again, without striking. This was repeated several times. The\r\nmob, seeing their efforts fruitless, became more enraged and\r\nthreatened to stone him, if he did not surrender himself into their\r\nhands. He again defied them, and declared that he would drown himself\r\nin the river, before they should have him. They then resorted to\r\npersuasion, and promised they would not hurt him. 'I'll die first;'\r\nwas his only reply. Even the furious mob was awed, and for a while\r\nstood dumb.\r\n\r\n\"After standing in the cold water for an hour, the miserable being\r\nbegan to fail. We observed him gradually sinking--his voice grew weak\r\nand tremulous--yet he continued to _curse_! In the midst of his oaths\r\nhe uttered broken sentences--'I did'nt steal the meat--I did'nt\r\nsteal--my master lives--master--master lives up the river--(his voice\r\nbegan to gurgle in his throat, and he was so chilled that his teeth\r\nchattered audibly)--I did'nt--steal--I did'nt steal--my--my\r\nmaster--my--I want to see my master--I didn't--no--my mas--you\r\nwant--you want to kill me--I didn't steal the'--His last words could\r\njust be heard as be sunk under the water.\r\n\r\n\"During this indescribable scene, _not one of the hundred that stood\r\naround made any effort to save the man until he was apparently\r\ndrowned_. He was then dragged out and stretched on the bow of the\r\nboat, and soon sufficient means were used for his recovery. The brutal\r\ncaptain ordered him to be taken off his boat--declaring, with an oath,\r\nthat he would throw him into the river again, if he was not\r\nimmediately removed. I withdrew, sick and horrified with this\r\nappalling exhibition of wickedness.\r\n\r\n\"Upon inquiry, I learned that the colored man lived some fifty miles\r\nup the Mississippi; that he had been charged with stealing some\r\narticle from the wharf; was fired upon with a pistol, and pursued by\r\nthe mob.\r\n\r\n\"In reflecting upon this unmingled cruelty--this insensibility to\r\nsuffering and disregard of life--I exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\r\n'Is there no flesh in man's obdurate heart?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One poor man, chased like a wolf by a hundred blood hounds, yelling,\r\nhowling, and gnashing their teeth upon him--plunges into the cold\r\nriver to seek protection! A crowd of spectators witness the scene,\r\nwith all the composure with which a Roman populace would look upon a\r\ngladiatorial show. Not a voice heard in the sufferer's behalf. At\r\nlength the powers of nature give way; the blood flows back to the\r\nheart--the teeth chatter--the voice trembles and dies, while the\r\nvictim drops down into his grave.\r\n\r\n\"What an atrocious system is that which leaves two millions of souls,\r\nfriendless and powerless--hunted and chased--afflicted and tortured\r\nand driven to death, without the means of redress.--Yet such is the\r\nsystem of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe 'public opinion' of slaveholders is illustrated by scores of\r\nannouncements in southern papers, like the following, from the\r\nRaleigh, (N.C.) Register, August 20, 1838. Joseph Gale and Son,\r\neditors and proprietors--the father and brother of the editor of the\r\nNational Intelligence, Washington city, D.C.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday night, Mr. George Holmes, of this county, and some of his\r\nfriends, were in pursuit of a runaway slave (the property of Mr.\r\nHolmes) and fell in with him in attempting to make his escape. Mr. H.\r\ndischarged a gun at his legs, for the purpose of disabling him; but\r\nunfortunately, the slave stumbled, and the shot struck him near the\r\nsmall of the back, of which wound he died in a short time. The slave\r\ncontinued to run some distance after he was shot, until overtaken by\r\none of the party. We are satisfied, from all that we can learn, that\r\nMr. H. had no intention of inflicting a mortal wound.\"\r\n\r\nOh! the _gentleman_, it seems, only shot at his legs, merely to\r\n'disable'--and it must be expected that every _gentleman_ will amuse\r\nhimself in shooting at his own property whenever the notion takes him,\r\nand if he should happen to hit a little higher and go through the\r\nsmall of the back instead of the legs, why every body says it is\r\n'unfortunate,' and the whole of the editorial corps, instead of\r\nbranding him as a barbarous wretch for shooting at his slave, whatever\r\npart be aimed at, join with the oldest editor in North Carolina, in\r\ncomplacently exonerating Mr. Holmes by saying, \"We are satisfied that\r\nMr. H. had no intention of inflicting a mortal wound.\" And so 'public\r\nopinion' wraps it up!\r\n\r\nThe Franklin (La.) Republican, August 19, 1837, has the following:\r\n\r\n\"NEGROES TAKEN.--Four gentlemen of this vicinity, went out yesterday\r\nfor the purpose of finding the camp of some noted runaways, supposed\r\nto be near this place; the camp was discovered about 11 o'clock, the\r\nnegroes four in number, three men and one woman, finding they were\r\ndiscovered, tried to make their escape through the cane; two of them\r\nwere fired on, one of which made his escape; the other one fell after\r\nrunning a short distance, his wounds are not supposed to be dangerous;\r\nthe other man was taken without any hurt; the woman also made her\r\nescape.\"\r\n\r\nThus terminated the mornings amusement of the '_four gentlemen_,'\r\nwhose exploits are so complacently chronicled by the editor of the\r\nFranklin Republican. The three men and one woman were all fired upon,\r\nit seems, though only one of them was shot down. The half famished\r\nrunaways made not the least resistance, they merely rushed in panic\r\namong the canes, at the sight of their pursuers, and the bullets\r\nwhistled after them and brought to the ground one poor fellow, who was\r\ncarried back by his captors as a trophy of the 'public opinion' among\r\nslaveholders.\r\n\r\nIn the Macon (Ga.) Telegraph, Nov. 27, 1838, we find the following\r\naccount of a runaway's den, and of the good luck of a 'Mr. Adams,' in\r\nrunning down one of them 'with his excellent dogs:'\r\n\r\n\"A runaway's den was discovered on Sunday near the Washington Spring,\r\nin a little patch of woods, where it had been for several months, so\r\nartfully concealed under ground, that it was detected only by\r\naccident, though in sight of two or three houses, and near the road\r\nand fields where there has been constant daily passing. The entrance\r\nwas concealed by a pile of pine straw, representing a hog bed--which\r\nbeing removed, discovered a trap door and steps that led to a room\r\nabout six feet square, comfortably ceiled with plank, containing a\r\nsmall fire-place the flue of which was ingeniously conducted above\r\nground and concealed by the straw. The inmates took the alarm and made\r\ntheir escape; but Mr. Adams and his excellent dogs being put upon the\r\ntrail, soon run down and secured one of them, which proved to be a\r\nnegro fellow who had been out about a year. He stated that the other\r\noccupant was a woman, who had been a runaway a still longer time. In\r\nthe den was found a quantity of meal, bacon, corn, potatoes, &c., and\r\nvarious cooking utensils and wearing apparel.\"\r\n\r\nYes, Mr. Adams' 'EXCELLENT DOGS' did the work! They were well trained,\r\nswift, fresh, keen-scented, 'excellent' men-hunters, and though the\r\npoor fugitive in his frenzied rush for liberty, strained every muscle,\r\nyet they gained upon him, and after dashing through fens, brier-beds,\r\nand the tangled undergrowth till faint and torn, he sinks, and the\r\nblood-hounds are upon him. What blood-vessels the poor struggler burst\r\nin his desperate push for life--how much he was bruised and lacerated\r\nin his plunge through the forest, or how much the dogs tore him, the\r\nMacon editor has not chronicled--they are matters of no moment--but\r\nhis heart is touched with the merits of Mr. Adams' 'EXCELLENT DOGS,'\r\nthat 'soon _run down_ and _secured_' a guiltless and trembling human\r\ncreature!\r\n\r\nThe Georgia Constitutionalist, of Jan. 1837, contains the following\r\nletter from the coroner of Barnwell District, South Carolina, dated\r\nAiken, S.C. Dec. 20, 1836.\r\n\r\n\"_To the Editor of the Constitutionalist:_\r\n\r\n\"I have just returned from an inquest I held over the body of a negro\r\nman, a runaway, that was shot near the South Edisto, in this District,\r\n(Barnwell,) on Saturday last. He came to his death by his own\r\nrecklessness. He refused to be taken alive--and said that other\r\nattempts to take him had been made, and he was determined that he\r\nwould not be taken. He was at first, (when those in pursuit of him\r\nfound it absolutely necessary,) shot at with small shot, with the\r\nintention of merely crippling him. He was shot at several times, and\r\nat last he was so disabled as to be compelled to surrender. He kept in\r\nthe run of a creek in a very dense swamp all the time that the\r\nneighbors were in pursuit of him. As soon as the negro was taken, the\r\nbest medical aid was procured, but he died on the same evening. One of\r\nthe witnesses at the Inquisition, stated that the negro boy said he\r\nwas from Mississippi, and belonged to so many persons, that he did not\r\nknow who his master was, but again he said his master's name was\r\nBrown. He said his name was Sam, and when asked by another witness,\r\nwho his master was, he muttered something like Augusta or Augustine.\r\nThe boy was apparently above thirty-five or forty years of age, about\r\nsix feet high, slightly yellow in the face, very long beard or\r\nwhiskers, and very stout built, and a stern countenance; and appeared\r\nto have been a runaway for a long time.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. PRITCHARD,\r\n_Coroner (Ex-officio,) Barnwell Dist. S.C._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk (Va.) Herald, of Feb. 1837, has the following:\r\n\r\n\"Three negroes in a ship's yawl, came on shore yesterday evening, near\r\nNew Point Comfort, and were soon after apprehended and lodged in jail.\r\nTheir story is, that they belonged to a brig from New York bound to\r\nHavana, which was cast away to the southward of Cape Henry, some day\r\nlast week; that the brig was called the Maria, Captain Whittemore. I\r\nhave no doubt they are deserters from some vessel in the bay, as their\r\nstatements are very confused and inconsistent. One of these fellows is\r\na mulatto, and calls himself Isaac Turner; the other two are quite\r\nblack, the one passing by the name of James Jones and the other John\r\nMurray. They have all their clothing with them, and are dressed in\r\nsea-faring apparel. They attempted to make their escape, and _it was\r\nnot till a musket was fired at them, and one of them slightly\r\nwounded_, that they surrendered. They will be kept in jail till\r\nsomething further is discovered respecting them.\"\r\n\r\nThe 'St. Francisville (La.) Chronicle,' of Feb. 1, 1839. Gives the\r\nfollowing account of a 'negro hunt,' in that Parish.\r\n\r\n\"Two or three days since a gentleman of this parish, in _hunting\r\nrunaway negroes_, came upon a camp of them in the swamp on Cat Island.\r\nHe succeeded in arresting two of them, but the third made fight; and\r\nupon _being shot in the shoulder_, fled to a sluice, where the _dogs\r\nsucceeded_ in drowning him before assistance could arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"'The dogs _succeeded_ in drowning him'! Poor fellow! He tried hard for\r\nhis life, plunged into the sluice, and, with a bullet in his shoulder,\r\nand the blood hounds unfleshing his bones, he bore up for a moment\r\nwith feeble stroke as best he might, but 'public opinion,'\r\n'_succeeded_ in drowning him,' and the same 'public opinion,' calls\r\nthe man who fired and crippled him, and cheered on the dogs, 'a\r\ngentleman,' and the editor who celebrates the exploit is a 'gentleman'\r\nalso!\"\r\n\r\nA large number of extracts similar to the above, might here be\r\ninserted from Southern newspapers in our possession, but the foregoing\r\nare more than sufficient for our purpose, and we bring to a close the\r\ntestimony on this point, with the following. Extract of a letter, from\r\nthe Rev. Samuel J. May, of South Scituate, Mass. dated Dec. 20, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"You doubtless recollect the narrative given in the Oasis, of a slave\r\nin Georgia, who having ranaway from his master, (accounted a very\r\nhospitable and even humane gentleman,) was hunted by his master and\r\nhis retainers with horses, dogs, and rifles, and having been driven\r\ninto a tree by the hounds, was shot down by his more cruel pursuers.\r\nAll the facts there given, and some others equally shocking, connected\r\nwith the same case, were first communicated to me in 1833, by Mr. W.\r\nRussell, a highly respectable teacher of youth in Boston. He is\r\ndoubtless ready to vouch for them. The same gentleman informed me that\r\nhe was keeping school on or near the plantation of the monster who\r\nperpetrated the above outrage upon humanity, that he was even invited\r\nby him to join in the hunt, and when he expressed abhorrence at the\r\nthought, the planter holding up the rifle which he had in his hand\r\nsaid with an oath, 'damn that rascal, this is the third time he has\r\nrunaway, and he shall never run again. I'd rather put a ball into his\r\nside, than into the best buck in the land.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Russell, in the account given by him of this tragedy in the\r\n'Oasis,' page 267, thus describes the slaveholder who made the above\r\nexpression, and was the leader of the 'hunt,' and in whose family he\r\nresided at the time as an instructor he says of him--he was \"an\r\nopulent planter, in whose family the evils of slaveholding were\r\npalliated by every expedient that a humane and generous disposition\r\ncould suggest. He was a man of noble and elevated character, and\r\ndistinguished for his generosity, and kindness of heart.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Mr. May, dated Feb. 3, 1839, Mr. Russell, speaking of\r\nthe hunting of runaways with dogs and guns, says: \"Occurrences of a\r\nnature similar to the one related in the 'Oasis,' were not unfrequent\r\nin the interior of Georgia and South Carolina twenty years ago.\r\n_Several_ such fell under my notice within the space of fifteen\r\nmonths. In two such 'hunts,' I was solicited to join.\"\r\n\r\nThe following was written by a sister-in-law of Gerrit Smith, Esq.,\r\nPeterboro. She is married to the son of a North Carolinian.\r\n\r\n\"In North Carolina, some years ago, several slaves were arrested for\r\ncommitting serious crimes and depredations, in the neighborhood of\r\nWilmington, among other things, burning houses, and, in one or more\r\ninstances, murder.\r\n\r\n\"It happened that the wife of one of these slaves resided in one of\r\nthe most respectable families in W. in the capacity of nurse. Mr. J.\r\n_the first lawyer in the place_, came into the room, where the lady of\r\nthe house, was sitting, with the nurse, who held a child in her arms,\r\nand, addressing the nurse, said, Hannah! would you know your husband\r\nif you should see him?--Oh, yes, sir, she replied--When HE DREW FROM\r\nBENEATH HIS CLOAK THE HEAD OF THE SLAVE, at the sight of which the\r\npoor woman immediately fainted. The heads of the others were placed\r\nupon poles, in some part of the town, afterwards known as 'Negro Head\r\nPoint.'\"\r\n\r\nWe have just received the above testimony, enclosed in a letter from\r\nMr. Smith, in which he says, \"that the fact stated by my\r\nsister-in-law, actually occurred, there can be no doubt.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the Diary of the Rev. ELIAS CORNELIUS, we\r\ninsert here, having neglected to do it under a preceding head, to\r\nwhich it more appropriately belongs.\r\n\r\n\"New Orleans, Sabbath, February 15, 1818. Early this morning\r\naccompanied A.H. Esq. to the _hospital_, with the view of making\r\narrangements to preach to such of the sick as could understand\r\nEnglish. The first room we entered presented a scene of human misery,\r\nsuch as I had never before witnessed. A poor negro man was lying upon\r\na couch, apparently in great distress; a more miserable object can\r\nhardly be conceived. His face was much _disfigured_, an IRON COLLAR,\r\nTWO INCHES WIDE AND HALF AN INCH THICK, WAS CLASPED ABOUT HIS NECK,\r\nwhile one of his feet and part of the leg were in a state of\r\nputrefaction. We inquired the cause of his being in this distressing\r\ncondition, and he answered us in a faltering voice, that he was\r\nwilling to tell us all the truth.\r\n\r\n\"He belonged to Mr. ---- a Frenchman, ran-away, was caught, and\r\npunished with one hundred lashes! This happened about Christmas; and\r\nduring the cold weather at that time, he was confined in the\r\n_Cane-house, with a scanty portion of clothing, and without fire_. In\r\nthis situation his foot had frozen, and mortified, and having been\r\nremoved from place to place, he was yesterday brought here by order of\r\nhis new master, who was an American. I had no time to protract my\r\nconversation with him then, but resolved to return in a few hours and\r\npray with him.\r\n\r\n\"Having returned home, I again visited the hospital at half past\r\neleven o'clock, and concluded first of all [he was to preach at 12,]\r\nto pray with the poor lacerated negro. I entered the apartment in\r\nwhich he lay, and observed an old man sitting upon a couch; but,\r\nwithout saying anything went up to the bed-side of the negro, who\r\nappeared to be asleep. I spoke to him, but he gave no answer. I spoke\r\nagain, and moved his head, still he said nothing. My apprehensions\r\nwere immediately excited, and I felt for his pulse, but it was gone.\r\nSaid I to the old man, 'surely this negro is dead.' 'No,' he answered,\r\n'he has fallen asleep, for he had a very restless season last night.'\r\nI again examined and called the old gentleman to the bed, and alas, it\r\nwas found true, that he was dead. Not an eye had witnessed his last\r\nstruggle, and I was the first, as it should happen, to discover the\r\nfact. I called several men into the room, and without ceremony they\r\nwrapped him in a sheet, and carried him to the _dead-house_ as it is\r\ncalled.\"--Edwards' Life of Rev. Elias Cornelius, pp. 101, 2, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROTECTION EXTENDED BY 'PUBLIC OPINION,' TO THE HEALTH[38] OF THE\r\nSLAVES.\r\n\r\nThis may be judged of from the fact that it is perfectly notorious\r\namong slaveholders, both North and South, that of the tens of\r\nthousands of slaves sold annually in the northern slave states to be\r\ntransported to the south, large numbers of them die under the severe,\r\nprocess of acclimation, _all_ suffer more or less, and multitudes\r\n_much_, in their health and strength, during their first years in the\r\nfar south and south west. That such is the case is sufficiently proved\r\nby the care taken by all who advertise for sale or hire in Louisiana,\r\nMississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, &c. to inform the reader, that their\r\nslaves are 'Creoles,' 'southern born,' 'country born,' &c. or if they\r\nare from the north, that they are 'acclimated,' and the importance\r\nattached to their _acclimation_, is shown in the fact, that it is\r\ngenerally distinguished from the rest of the advertisements either by\r\n_italics_ or CAPITALS. Almost every newspaper published in the states\r\nfar south contains advertisements like the following.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: See pp. 37-39.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Vicksburg (Mi.)

The Governor, commenting upon\r\nthe law of the state which provides that persons convicted of certain\r\ncrimes shall be sold as servants for a limited time, says,\r\n\r\n\"_The case is widely different with the negro(!)_ Although ordered to\r\nbe disposed of as a servant for a term of years, _perpetual slavery in\r\nthe south is his inevitable doom_; unless, peradventure, age or\r\ndisease may have rendered him worthless, or some resident of the\r\nState, from motives of _benevolence_, will pay for him three or four\r\ntimes his intrinsic _value_.

Of course they are purchased _with the\r\nexpress view to their transportation for life_, and bring such\r\nenormous prices as to prevent all _competition_ on the part of those\r\nof our citizens who _require_ their services, and _would keep them in\r\nthe State_.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Memphis (Ten.)

'HE WAS ORIGINALLY\r\nFROM NEW YORK,' he tells us.

Bonneval, Martin's La.

Derbigny_, J. The petitioner is a negro in actual state of\r\nslavery; he claims his freedom, and is bound to prove it. In his\r\nattempt, however, to show that he was free before he was introduced\r\ninto this country, he has failed, so that his claim rests entirely on\r\nthe laws prohibiting the introduction of slaves in the United States.\r\nThat the plaintiff was imported since that prohibition does exist is a\r\nfact sufficiently established by the evidence. What right he has\r\nacquired under the laws forbidding such importation is the only\r\nquestion which we have to examine. Formerly, while the act dividing\r\nLouisiana into two territories was in force in this country, slaves\r\nintroduced here in contravention to it, were freed by operation of\r\nlaw; but that act was merged in the legislative provisions which were\r\nsubsequently enacted on the subject of importation of slaves into the\r\nUnited States generally. Under the now existing laws, the individuals\r\nthus imported acquire _no personal right_, they are mere passive\r\nbeings, who are disposed of _according to the will_ of the different\r\nstate legislatures. In this country they are to _remain slaves_, and\r\nTO BE SOLD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE. The plaintiff, therefore, has\r\nnothing to claim as a freeman; and as to a mere change of master,\r\nshould such be his wish, _he cannot be listened to in a court of\r\njustice_.\"\r\n\r\nExtract from a speech of Mr. Thomson of Penn. in Congress, March 1,\r\n1826, on the prisons in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\"I visited the prisons twice that I might myself ascertain the truth.\r\n* * In one of these cells (but eight feet square,) were confined at\r\nthat time, seven persons, three women and four children. The children\r\nwere confined under a strange system of law in this District, by which\r\na colored person who _alleges_ HE IS FREE, and appeals to the\r\ntribunals of the country, to have the matter tried, is COMMITTED TO\r\nPRISON, till the decision takes place. They were almost naked--one of\r\nthem was sick, lying on the damp brick floor, _without bed, pillow, or\r\ncovering_. In this abominable cell, seven human beings were confined\r\nday by day, and night after night, without a bed, chair, or stool, or\r\nany other of the most common necessaries of life.\"--_Gales'\r\nCongressional Debates_, v.2, p. 1480.\r\n\r\nThe following facts serve to show, that the present generation of\r\nslaveholders do but follow in the footsteps of their fathers, in their\r\nzeal for LIBERTY.\r\n\r\nExtract from a document submitted by the Committee of the yearly\r\nmeeting of Friends in Philadelphia, to the Committee of Congress, to\r\nwhom was referred the memorial of the people called Quakers, in 1797.\r\n\r\n\"In the latter part of the year 1776, several of the people called\r\nQuakers, residing in the counties of Perquimans and Pasquotank, in the\r\nstate of North Carolina, liberated their negroes, as it was then clear\r\nthere was no existing law to prevent their so doing; for the law of\r\n1741 could not at that time be carried into effect; and they were\r\nsuffered to remain free, until a law passed, in the spring of 1777,\r\nunder which they were taken up and sold, contrary to the Bill of\r\nRights, recognized in the constitution of that state, as a part\r\nthereof, and to which it was annexed.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1777, when the General Assembly met for the first\r\ntime, a law was enacted to prevent slaves from being emancipated,\r\nexcept for meritorious services, &c. to be judged of by the county\r\ncourts or the general assembly; and ordering, that if any should be\r\nmanumitted in any other way, they be taken up, and the county courts\r\nwithin whose jurisdictions they are apprehended should order them to\r\nbe sold. Under this law the county courts of Perquimans and\r\nPasquotank, in the year 1777, ordered A LARGE NUMBER OF PERSONS TO BE\r\nSOLD, WHO WERE FREE AT THE TIME THE LAW WAS MADE. In the year 1778\r\nseveral of those cases were, by certiorari, brought before the\r\nsuperior court for the district of Edentorn, where the decisions of\r\nthe county courts were reversed, the superior court declaring, that\r\nsaid county courts, in such their proceedings, have exceeded their\r\njurisdiction, violated the rights of the subject, and acted in direct\r\nopposition to the Bill of Rights of this state, considered justly as\r\npart of the constitution thereof; by giving to a law, not intended to\r\naffect this case, a retrospective operation, thereby to deprive free\r\nmen of this state of their liberty, contrary to the laws of the land.\r\nIn consequence of this decree several of the negroes were again set at\r\nliberty; but the next General Assembly, early in 1779, passed a law,\r\nwherein they mention, that doubts have arisen, whether the purchasers\r\nof such slaves have a good and legal title thereto, and CONFIRM the\r\nsame; under which they were again taken up by the purchasers and\r\nreduced to slavery.\"\r\n\r\n[The number of persons thus re-enslaved was 134.]\r\n\r\nThe following are the decrees of the Courts, ordering the sale of\r\nthose freemen:--\r\n\r\n\"Perquimans County, July term, at Hartford, A.D. 1777.\r\n\r\n\"These may certify, that it was then and there ordered, that the\r\nsheriff of the county, to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock, expose to\r\nsale, to the highest bidder, for ready money, at the court-house door,\r\nthe several negroes taken up as free, and in his custody, agreeable to\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\"Test.

In one instance, a mother torn from all her children and\r\ntaken to a remote part of another state, presses her way back through\r\nthe wilderness, hundreds of miles, to clasp once more her children to\r\nher heart: but, when she has arrived within a few miles of them, in\r\nthe same county, is discovered, seized, dragged to jail, and her\r\npurchaser told, through an advertisement, that she awaits his order.\r\nBut we need not trace out the harrowing details already before the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nRev. C.S. RENSHAW, of Quincy, Illinois, who resided some time in\r\nKentucky, says;--\r\n\r\n\"I was told the following fact by a young lady, daughter of a\r\nslaveholder in Boone county, Kentucky, who lived within half a mile of\r\nMr. Hughes' farm. Hughes and Neil traded in slaves down the river:\r\nthey had bought up a part of their stock in the upper counties of\r\nKentucky, and brought them down to Louisville, where the remainder of\r\ntheir drove was in jail, waiting their arrival. Just before the\r\nsteamboat put off for the lower country, two negro women were offered\r\nfor sale, each of them having a young child at the breast. The traders\r\nbought them, took their babes from their arms, and offered them to the\r\nhighest bidder; and they were sold for one dollar apiece, whilst the\r\nstricken parents were driven on board the boat; and in an hour were on\r\ntheir way to the New Orleans market. You are aware that a young babe\r\n_decreases_ the value of a field hand in the lower country, whilst it\r\nincreases her value in the 'breeding states.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from an address, published by the\r\nPresbyterian Synod of Kentucky, to the churches under their care, in\r\n1835:--\r\n\r\n\"Brothers and sisters, parents and children, husbands and wives, are\r\n_torn asunder_, and permitted to see each other no more. These acts\r\nare DAILY occurring in the midst of us. The _shrieks_ and the _agony,\r\noften_ witnessed on such occasions, proclaim, with a trumpet tongue,\r\nthe iniquity of our system. _There is not a neighborhood_ where these\r\nheart-rending scenes are not displayed. _There is not a village or\r\nroad_ that does not behold the sad procession of manacled outcasts,\r\nwhose mournful countenances tell that they are exiled by _force_ from\r\nALL THAT THEIR HEARTS HOLD DEAR.\"--_Address_, p. 12.\r\n\r\nProfessor ANDREWS, late of the University of North Carolina, in his\r\nrecent work on Slavery and the Slave Trade, page 147, in relating a\r\nconversation with a slave-trader, whom he met near Washington City,\r\nsays, he inquired,\r\n\r\n\"'Do you _often_ buy the wife without the husband?'

Sept.\r\n28, 1838.\"\r\n\r\nExtract Of a letter to a member of Congress from a friend in\r\nMississippi, published in the \"Washington Globe,\" June, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"The times are truly alarming here. Many plantations _are entirely\r\nstripped of negroes_ (protection!) and horses, by the marshal or\r\nsheriff.--Suits are multiplying--two thousand five hundred in the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court, and three thousand in Hinds County\r\nCourt.\"\r\n\r\nTestimony of MR. SILAS STONE, of Hudson, New York. Mr. Stone is a\r\nmember of the Episcopal Church, has several times been elected an\r\nAssessor of the city of Hudson, and for three years has filled the\r\noffice of Treasurer of the County. In the fall of 1807, Mr. Stone\r\nwitnessed a sale of slaves, in Charleston, South Carolina, which he\r\nthus describes in a communication recently received from him.\r\n\r\n\"I saw droves of the poor fellows driven to the slave markets kept in\r\ndifferent parts of the city, one of which I visited. The arrangements\r\nof this place appeared something like our northern horse-markets,\r\nhaving sheds, or barns, in the rear of a public house, where alcohol\r\nwas a handy ingredient to stimulate the spirit of jockeying. As the\r\ntraders appeared, lots of negroes were brought from the stables into\r\nthe bar room, and by a flourish of the whip were made to assume an\r\nactive appearance. 'What will you give for these fellows?' 'How old\r\nare they? 'Are they healthy?' 'Are they quick?' &c. at the same time\r\nthe owner would give them a cut with a cowhide, and tell them to dance\r\nand jump, cursing and swearing at them if they did not move quick. In\r\nfact all the transactions in buying and selling slaves, partakes of\r\njockey-ship, as much as buying and selling horses. There was as little\r\nregard paid to the feelings of the former as we witness in the latter.\r\n\r\n\"From these scenes I turn to another, which took place in front of the\r\nnoble 'Exchange Buildings,' in the heart of the city. On the left side\r\nof the steps, as you leave the main hall, immediately under the\r\nwindows of that proud building, was a stage built, on which a mother\r\nwith eight children were placed, and sold at auction. I watched their\r\nemotions closely, and saw their feelings were in accordance to human\r\nnature. The sale began with the eldest child, who, being struck off to\r\nthe highest bidder, was taken from the stage or platform by the\r\npurchaser, and led to his wagon and stowed away, to be carried into\r\nthe country; the second, and third were also sold, and so until seven\r\nof the children were torn from their mother, while her discernment\r\ntold her they were to be separated probably forever, causing in that\r\nmother the most agonizing sobs and cries, in which the children seemed\r\nto share. The scene beggars description; suffice it to say, it was\r\nsufficient to cause tears from one at least 'whose skin was not\r\ncolored like their own,' and I was not ashamed to give vent to them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"PROTECTION\" AFFORDED BY \"PUBLIC OPINION\"\r\nTO CHILDHOOD AND OLD AGE.\r\n\r\nIn the \"New Orleans Bee,\" May 31, 1837, MR.

Kentucky, in company with Mr. Willis, a teacher of sacred music\r\nand a member of the Presbyterian Church, I was startled at mingled\r\nshouts and screams, proceeding from an old log house, some distance\r\nfrom the road side. As we passed it, some five or six boys from 12 to\r\n15 years of age, came out, some of them cracking whips, followed by\r\ntwo colored boys crying. I asked Mr. W. what the scene meant. 'Oh,' he\r\nreplied, 'those boys have been whipping the niggers; that is the way\r\nwe bring slaves into subjection in Kentucky--we let the children beat\r\nthem.' The boys returned again into the house, and again their\r\nshouting and stamping was heard, but ever and anon a scream of agony\r\nthat would not be drowned, rose above the uproar; thus they continued\r\ntill the sounds were lost in the distance.\"\r\n\r\nWell did Jefferson say, that the children of slaveholders are 'NURSED,\r\nEDUCATED, AND DAILY EXERCISED IN TYRANNY.'\r\n\r\nThe 'protection' thrown around a mother's yearnings, and the\r\nhelplessness of childhood by the 'public opinion' of slaveholders, is\r\nshown by _thousands_ of advertisements of which the following are\r\nsamples.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"New Orleans Bulletin,\" June 2.\r\n\r\n\"NEGROES FOR SALE.--A negro woman 21 years of age, and has two\r\nchildren, one eight and the other three years.

O, thou Great Eternal, is this\r\njustice! is this equity!!--Equal Rights!!\"\r\n\r\nWe subjoin a few miscellaneous facts illustrating the INHUMANITY of\r\nslaveholding 'public opinion.'\r\n\r\nThe shocking indifference manifested at the death of slaves as _human\r\nbeings_, contrasted with the grief at their loss _as property_, is a\r\ntrue index to the public opinion of slaveholders.\r\n\r\nColonel Oliver of Louisville, lost a valuable race-horse by the\r\nexplosion of the steamer Oronoko, a few months since on the\r\nMississippi river. Eight human beings whom he held as slaves were also\r\nkilled by the explosion. They were the riders and grooms of his\r\nrace-horses. A Louisville paper thus speaks of the occurrence:\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Oliver suffered severely by the explosion of the Oronoko. He\r\nlost _eight_ of his rubbers and riders, and his horse, Joe Kearney,\r\nwhich he had sold the night before for $3,000.\"\r\n\r\nMr. King, of the New York American, makes the following just comment\r\non the barbarity of the above paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Would any one, in reading this paragraph from an evening paper,\r\nconjecture that these '_eight_ rubbers and riders,' that together with\r\na horse, are merely mentioned as a 'loss' to their owner, were human\r\nbeings--immortal as the writer who thus brutalizes them, and perhaps\r\ncherishing life as much? In this view, perhaps, the 'eight' lost as\r\nmuch as Colonel Oliver.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is from the \"Charleston (S.C.)

No place in the\r\nUnited States offers as great opportunities for the acquisition of\r\nanatomical knowledge, SUBJECTS BEING OBTAINED FROM AMONG THE COLORED\r\nPOPULATION IN SUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR EVERY PURPOSE, AND PROPER\r\nDISSECTIONS CARRIED ON WITHOUT OFFENDING ANY INDIVIDUALS IN THE\r\nCOMMUNITY!!\"\r\n\r\n_Without offending any individuals in the community_! More than half\r\nthe population of Charleston, we believe, is 'colored;' _their_ graves\r\nmay be ravaged, their dead may be dug up, dragged into the dissecting\r\nroom, exposed to the gaze, heartless gibes, and experimenting knives,\r\nof a crowd of inexperienced operators, who are given to understand in\r\nthe prospectus, that, if they do not acquire manual dexterity in\r\ndissection, it will be wholly their own fault, in neglecting to\r\nimprove the unrivalled advantages afforded by the institution--since\r\neach can have as many human bodies as he pleases to experiment\r\nupon--and as to the fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, brothers, and\r\nsisters, of those whom they cut to pieces from day to day, why, they\r\nare not 'individuals in the community,' but 'property,' and however\r\n_their_ feelings may be tortured, the 'public opinion' of slaveholders\r\nis entirely too 'chivalrous' to degrade itself by caring for them!\r\n\r\nThe following which has been for some time a standing advertisement of\r\nthe South Carolina Medical College, in the Charleston papers, is\r\nanother index of the same 'public opinion' toward slaves. We give an\r\nextract:--\r\n\r\n\"_Surgery of the Medical College of South Carolina, Queen st_.--The\r\nFaculty inform their professional brethren, and the public that they\r\nhave established a _Surgery_, at the Old College, Queen street, FOR\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF NEGROES, which will continue in operation, during the\r\nsession of the College, say from first November, to the fifteenth of\r\nMarch ensuing.\r\n\r\n\"The _object_ of the Faculty, in opening this Surgery, is to collect\r\nas _many interesting cases_, as possible, for the _benefit_ and\r\n_instruction_ of their pupils--at the same time, they indulge the\r\nhope, that it may not only prove an _accommodation_, but also a matter\r\nof economy to the public. They would respectfully call the attention\r\nof planters, living in the vicinity of the city, to this subject;\r\nparticularly such as may have servants laboring under Surgical\r\ndiseases. Such _persons of color_ as may not be able to pay for\r\nMedical advice, will be attended to gratis, at stated hours, as often\r\nas may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\"The Faculty take this opportunity of soliciting the co-operation of\r\nsuch of their professional brethren, as are favorable to their\r\nobjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first thing that strikes the reader of the advertisement is, that\r\nthis _Surgery_ is established exclusively 'for the treatment of\r\n_negroes_; and, if he knows little of the hearts of slaveholders\r\ntowards their slaves, he charitably supposes, that they 'feel the dint\r\nof pity,' for the poor sufferers and have founded this institution as\r\na special charity for their relief. But the delusion vanishes as he\r\nreads on; the professors take special care that no such derogatory\r\ninference shall be drawn from their advertisement. They give us the\r\nthree reasons which have induced them to open this 'Surgery for the\r\ntreatment of negroes.' The first and main one is, 'to collect as many\r\n_interesting cases_ as possible for the benefit and instruction of\r\ntheir _pupils_--another is, 'the hope that it may prove an\r\n_accommodation_,'--and the third, that it may be 'a matter of economy\r\nto the _public_' Another reason, doubtless, and controlling one,\r\nthough the professors are silent about it, is that a large collection\r\nof 'interesting surgical cases,' always on hand, would prove a\r\npowerful attraction to students, and greatly increase the popularity\r\nof the institution. In brief, then, the motives of its founders, the\r\nprofessors, were these, the accommodation of their _students_--the\r\naccommodation of the _public_ (which means, _the whites_)--and the\r\naccommodation of slaveholders who have on their hands disabled slaves,\r\nthat would make 'interesting cases,' for surgical operation in the\r\npresence of the pupils--to these reasons we may add the accommodation\r\nof the Medical Institution and the accommodation of _themselves_! Not\r\na syllable about the _accommodation_ of the hopeless sufferers,\r\nwrithing with the agony of those gun shot wounds, fractured sculls,\r\nbroken limbs and ulcerated backs which constitute the 'interesting\r\ncases' for the professors to 'show off' before their pupils, and, as\r\npractice makes perfect, for the students themselves to try their hands\r\nat by way of experiment.\r\n\r\nWhy, we ask, was this surgery established 'for the treatment of\r\n_negroes'_ alone? Why were these 'interesting cases' selected from\r\nthat class exclusively? No man who knows the feeling of slave holders\r\ntowards slaves will be at a loss for the reason. 'Public opinion'\r\nwould tolerate surgical experiments, operations, processes, performed\r\nupon them, which it would execrate if performed upon their master or\r\nother whites. As the great object in collecting the disabled negroes\r\nis to have 'interesting cases' for the students, the professors who\r\nperform the operations will of course endeavor to make them as\r\n'interesting' as possible. The _instruction of the student_ is the\r\nimmediate object, and if the professors can accomplish it best by\r\n_protracting_ the operation, pausing to explain the different\r\nprocesses, &c. the subject is only a negro, and what is his protracted\r\nagony, that it should restrain the professor from making the case as\r\n'interesting' as possible to the students by so using his knife as\r\nwill give them the best knowledge of the parts, and the process,\r\nhowever it may protract or augment the pain of the subject. The _end_\r\nto be accomplished is the _instruction_ of the student, operations\r\nupon the negroes are the _means_ to the end; _that_ tells the whole\r\nstory--and he who knows the hearts of slaveholders and has common\r\nsense, however short the allowance, can find the way to his\r\nconclusions without a lantern.\r\n\r\nBy an advertisement of the same Medical Institution, dated November\r\n12, 1838, and published in the Charleston papers, it appears that an\r\n'infirmary has been opened in connection with the college.' The\r\nprofessors manifest a great desire that the masters of servants should\r\nsend in their disabled slaves, and as an inducement to the furnishing\r\nof such _interesting cases_ say, all medical and surgical aid will be\r\noffered _without making them liable to any professional charges_.\r\nDisinterested bounty, pity, sympathy, philanthropy. However difficult\r\nor numerous the surgical cases of slaves thus put into their hands by\r\nthe masters, they charge not a cent for their _professional services_.\r\nTheir yearnings over human distress are so intense, that they beg the\r\nprivilege of performing all operations, and furnishing all the medical\r\nattention needed, _gratis_, feeling that the relief of misery is its\r\nown reward!!! But we have put down our exclamation points too\r\nsoon--upon reading the whole of the advertisement we find the\r\nprofessors conclude it with the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\"The SOLE OBJECT Of the faculty in the establishment of such an\r\ninstitution being to promote the interest of Medical Education within\r\ntheir native State and City.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Charleston (South Carolina) Mercury\" of October 12, 1838, we\r\nfind an advertisement of half a column, by a Dr. T. Stillman, setting\r\nforth the merits of another 'Medical Infirmary,' under his own special\r\nsupervision, at No. 110 Church street, Charleston. The doctor, after\r\ninveighing loudly against 'men totally ignorant of medical science,'\r\nwho flood the country with quack nostrums backed up by 'fabricated\r\nproofs of miraculous cures,' proceeds to enumerate the diseases to\r\nwhich his 'Infirmary' is open, and to which his practice will be\r\nmainly confined. Appreciating the importance of 'interesting cases,'\r\nas a stock in trade, on which to commence his experiments, he copies\r\nthe example of the medical professors, and advertises for them. But,\r\neither from a keener sense of justice, or more generosity, or greater\r\nconfidence in his skill, or for some other reason, he proposes to _buy\r\nup_ an assortment of _damaged_ negroes, given over, as incurable, by\r\nothers, and to make such his 'interesting cases,' instead of\r\nexperimenting on those who are the 'property' of others.\r\n\r\nDr. Stillman closes his advertisement with the following notice:--\r\n\r\n\"To PLANTERS AND OTHERS.--Wanted _fifty negroes_. Any person having\r\nsick negroes, considered incurable by their respective physicians, and\r\nwishing to dispose of them, Dr. S. will pay cash for negroes affected\r\nwith scrofula or king's evil, confirmed hypocondriasm, apoplexy,\r\ndiseases of the liver, kidneys, spleen, stomach and intestines,\r\nbladder and its appendages, diarrhea, dysentery, &c. The highest cash\r\nprice will be paid on application as above.\"\r\n\r\nThe absolute barbarism of a 'public opinion' which not only tolerates,\r\nbut _produces_ such advertisements as this, was outdone by nothing in\r\nthe dark ages. If the reader has a heart of flesh, he can feel it\r\nwithout help, and if he has not, comment will not create it. The total\r\nindifference of slaveholders to such a cold blooded proposition, their\r\nutter unconsciousness of the paralysis of heart, and death of\r\nsympathy, and every feeling of common humanity for the slave, which it\r\nreveals, is enough, of itself to show that the tendency of the spirit\r\nof slaveholding is, to kill in the soul whatever it touches. It has no\r\neyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor mind to understand, nor heart to\r\nfeel for its victims as _human beings_. To show that the above\r\nindication of the savage state is not an index of individual feeling,\r\nbut of 'public opinion,' it is sufficient to say, that it appears to\r\nbe a standing advertisement in the Charleston Mercury, the leading\r\npolitical paper of South Carolina, the organ of the Honorables John C.\r\nCalhoun, Robert Barnwell Rhett, Hugh S. Legare, and others regarded as\r\nthe elite of her statesmen and literati. Besides, candidates for\r\npopular favor, like the doctor who advertises for the fifty\r\n'incurables,' take special care to conciliate, rather than outrage,\r\n'public opinion.' Is the doctor so ignorant of 'public opinion' in his\r\nown city, that he has unwittingly committed violence upon it in his\r\nadvertisement? We trow not. The same 'public opinion' which gave birth\r\nto the advertisement of doctor Stillman, and to those of the\r\nprofessors in both the medical institutions, founded the Charleston\r\n'Work House'--a soft name for a Moloch temple dedicated to torture,\r\nand reeking with blood, in the midst of the city; to which masters and\r\nmistresses send their slaves of both sexes to be stripped, tied up,\r\nand cut with the lash till the blood and mangled flesh flow to their\r\nfeet, or to be beaten and bruised with the terrible paddle, or forced\r\nto climb the tread-mill till nature sinks, or to experience other\r\nnameless torments.\r\n\r\nThe \"Vicksburg (Miss.) Register,\" Dec. 27, 1838, contains the\r\nfollowing item of information: \"ARDOR IN BETTING.--Two gentlemen, at a\r\ntavern, having summoned the waiter, the poor fellow had scarcely\r\nentered, when he fell down in a fit of apoplexy. 'He's dead!'\r\nexclaimed one. 'He'll come to!' replied the other. 'Dead, for five\r\nhundred!' 'Done!' retorted the second. The noise of the fall, and the\r\nconfusion which followed, brought up the landlord, who called out to\r\nfetch a doctor. 'No! no! we must have no interference--there's a bet\r\ndepending!' 'But, sir, I shall lose a valuable servant!' 'Never mind!\r\nyou can put him down in the bill!'\"\r\n\r\nAbout the time the Vicksburg paper containing the above came to hand,\r\nwe received a letter from N.P. ROGERS, Esq. of Concord, N.H. the\r\neditor of the 'Herald of Freedom,' from which the following is an\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n\"Some thirty years ago, I think it was, Col. Thatcher, of Maine, a\r\nlawyer, was in Virginia, on business, and was there invited to dine at\r\na public house, with a company of the gentry of the south. _The place_\r\nI forget--the fact was told me by George Kimball, Esq. now of Alton,\r\nIllinois who had the story from Col. Thatcher himself. Among the\r\nservants waiting was a young negro man, whose beautiful person,\r\nobliging and assiduous temper, and his activity and grace in serving,\r\nmade him a favorite with the company. The dinner lasted into the\r\nevening, and the wine passed freely about the table. At length, one of\r\nthe gentlemen, who was pretty highly excited with wine, became\r\nunfortunately incensed, either at some trip of the young slave, in\r\nwaiting, or at some other cause happening when the slave was within\r\nhis reach. He seized the long-necked wine bottle, and struck the young\r\nman suddenly in the temple, and felled him dead upon the floor. The\r\nfall arrested, for a moment, the festivities of the table. 'Devilish\r\nunlucky,' exclaimed one. 'The gentleman is very unfortunate,' cried\r\nanother. 'Really a loss,' said a third, &c, &c. The body was dragged\r\nfrom the dining hall, and the feast went on; and at the close, one of\r\nthe gentlemen, and the very one, I believe, whose hand had done the\r\nhomicide, shouted, in bacchanalian bravery, and _southern generosity_,\r\namid the broken glasses and fragments of chairs, 'LANDLORD! PUT THE\r\nNIGGER INTO THE BILL!' This was that murdered young man's _requiem and\r\nfuneral service_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE A. AVERY, a merchant in Rochester, New York, and an elder\r\nin the Fourth Presbyterian Church in that city, who resided four years\r\nin Virginia, gives the following testimony:\r\n\r\n\"I knew a young man who had been out hunting, and returning with some\r\nof his friends, seeing a negro man in the road, at a little distance,\r\ndeliberately drew up his rifle, and shot him dead. This was done\r\nwithout the slightest provocation, or a word passing. This young man\r\npassed through the _form_ of a trial, and, although it was not even\r\n_pretended_ by his counsel that he was not guilty of the act,\r\ndeliberately and wantonly perpetrated, _he was acquitted_. It was\r\nurged by his counsel, that he was a _young_ man, (about 20 years of\r\nage,) had no _malicious_ intention, his mother was a widow, &c, &c\"\r\n\r\nMr. BENJAMIN CLENDENON, of Colerain, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, a\r\nmember of the Society of Friends, gives the following testimony:\r\n\r\n\"Three years ago the coming month, I took a journey of about\r\nseventy-five miles from home, through the eastern shore of Maryland,\r\nand a small part of Delaware. Calling one day, near noon, at\r\nGeorgetown Cross-Roads, I found myself surrounded in the tavern by\r\nslaveholders. Among other subjects of conversation, their human cattle\r\ncame in for a share. One of the company, a middle-aged man, then\r\nliving with a second wife, acknowledged, that after the death of his\r\nfirst wife, he lived in a state of concubinage with a female slave;\r\nbut when the time drew near for the taking of a second wife, he found\r\nit expedient to remove the slave from the premises. The same person\r\ngave an account of a female slave he formerly held, who had a\r\npropensity for some one pursuit, I think the attendance of religious\r\nmeetings. On a certain occasion, she presented her petition to him,\r\nasking for this indulgence; he refused--she importuned--and he, with\r\nsovereign indignation, seized a chair, and with a blow upon the head,\r\nknocked her senseless upon the floor. The same person, for some act of\r\ndisobedience, on the part, I think, of the same slave, when employed\r\nin stacking straw, felled her to the earth with the handle of a pitch\r\nfork. All these transactions were related with the _utmost composure_,\r\nin a bar-room within thirty miles of the Pennsylvania line.\"\r\n\r\nThe two following advertisements are illustrations of the regard paid\r\nto the marriage relations by slaveholding judges, governors, senators\r\nin Congress, and mayors of cities.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Montgomery, (Ala.)

Henry L.\r\nPinckney, late member of Congress from Charleston District, and now\r\nIntendant (mayor) of that city.\r\n\r\nIt is no difficult matter to get at the 'public opinion' of a\r\ncommunity, when _ladies_ 'of property and standing' publish, under\r\ntheir own names, such advertisements as the following.\r\n\r\nMrs. ELIZABETH L.

LUCY LONG.\"\r\n\r\nIf the reader, after perusing the preceding facts, testimony, and\r\narguments, still insists that the 'public opinion' of the slave states\r\nprotects the slave from outrages, and alleges, as proof of it, that\r\n_cruel_ masters are frowned upon and shunned by the community\r\ngenerally, and regarded as monsters, we reply by presenting the\r\nfollowing facts and testimony.\r\n\r\n\"Col. MEANS, of Manchester, Ohio, says, that when he resided in South\r\nCarolina, _his neighbor_, a physician, became enraged with his slave,\r\nand sentenced him to receive two hundred lashes. After having received\r\none hundred and forty, he fainted. After inflicting the full number of\r\nlashes, the cords with which he was bound were loosed. When he\r\nrevived, he staggered to the house, and sat down in the sun. Being\r\nfaint and thirsty, he _begged_ for some water to drink. The master\r\nwent to the well, and procured some water but instead of giving him to\r\ndrink, he threw the whole bucket-full in his face. Nature could not\r\nstand the shock--he sunk to rise no more. For this crime, the\r\nphysician was bound over to Court, and tried, and _acquitted_--and THE\r\nNEXT YEAR HE WAS ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE!\"\r\n\r\nTestimony of Hon. JOHN RANDOLPH, of Virginia\r\n\r\n\"In one of his Congressional speeches, Mr. R. says: Avarice alone can\r\ndrive, as it does drive, this _infernal_ traffic, and the wretched\r\nvictims of it, like so many post horses, _whipped to death_ in a mail\r\ncoach. Ambition has its cover-sluts in the pride, pomp, and\r\ncircumstance of glorious war; but where are the trophies of avarice?\r\nThe hand cuff, the manacle, the blood-stained cowhide! WHAT MAN IS\r\nWORSE RECEIVED IN SOCIETY FOR BEING A HARD MASTER? WHO DENIES THE HAND\r\nOF A SISTER OR DAUGHTER TO SUCH MONSTERS?\"\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE A. AVERY, of Rochester, New York, who resided four years in\r\nVirginia, testifies as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I know a local Methodist minister, a man of talents, and popular as a\r\npreacher, who took his negro girl into his barn, in order to whip\r\nher--and _she was brought out a corpse_! His friends seemed to think\r\nthis of _so little importance to his ministerial standing_, that\r\nalthough I lived near him about three years, I do not recollect to\r\nhave heard them apologize for the deed, though I recollect having\r\nheard ONE of his neighbors allege this fact as a reason why he did not\r\nwish to hear him preach.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the mass of testimony which has been presented\r\nestablishing the fact that in the 'public opinion' of the South the\r\nslaves find no protection, some may still claim that the 'public\r\nopinion' exhibited by the preceding facts is not that of the _highest\r\nclass of society at the South_, and in proof of this assertion, refer\r\nto the fact, that 'Negro Brokers,' Negro Speculators, Negro\r\nAuctioneers, and Negro Breeders, &c., are by that class universally\r\ndespised and avoided, as are all who treat their slaves with cruelty.\r\n\r\nTo this we reply, that, if all claimed by the objector were true, it\r\ncould avail him nothing for 'public opinion' is neither made nor\r\nunmade by 'the first class of society.' That class produces in it, at\r\nmost, but slight modifications; those who belong to it have generally\r\na 'public opinion,' within their own circle which has rarely more,\r\neither of morality or mercy than the public opinion of the mass, and\r\nis, at least, equally heartless and more intolerant. As to the\r\nestimation in which 'speculators,' 'soul drivers,' &c. are held, we\r\nremark, that, they are not despised because they _trade in slaves_ but\r\nbecause they are _working_ men, all such are despised by slaveholders.\r\nWhite drovers who go with droves of swine and cattle from the free\r\nstates to the slave states, and Yankee pedlars, who traverse the\r\nsouth, and white day-laborers are, in the main, equally despised, or,\r\nif negro-traders excite more contempt than drovers, pedlars, and\r\nday-laborers, it is because, they are, as a class more ignorant and\r\nvulgar, men from low families and boors in their manners. Ridiculous\r\nto suppose, that a people, who have, _by law_, made men articles of\r\ntrade equally with swine, should despise men-drovers and traders, more\r\nthan hog-drovers and traders. That they are not despised because it is\r\ntheir business to trade in _human beings_ and bring them to market, is\r\nplain from the fact that when some 'gentleman of property and\r\nstanding' and of a 'good family' embarks in a negro speculation, and\r\nemploys a dozen 'soul drivers' to traverse the upper country, and\r\ndrive to the south coffles of slaves, expending hundreds of thousands\r\nin his wholesale purchases, he does not lose caste. It is known in\r\nAlabama, that Mr. Erwin, son-in-law of the Hon. Henry Clay, and\r\nbrother of J.P. Erwin, formerly postmaster, and late mayor of the\r\ncity of Nashville, laid the foundation of a princely fortune in the\r\nslave-trade, carried on from the Northern Slave States to the Planting\r\nSouth; that the Hon. H. Hitchcock, brother-in-law of Mr. E., and since\r\none of the judges of the Supreme Court of Alabama, was interested with\r\nhim in the traffic; and that a late member of the Kentucky Senate\r\n(Col. Wall) not only carried on the same business, a few years ago,\r\nbut accompanied his droves in person down the Mississippi. Not as the\r\n_driver_, for that would be vulgar drudgery, beneath a gentleman, but\r\nas a nabob in state, ordering his understrappers.\r\n\r\nIt is also well known that President Jackson was a 'soul driver,' and\r\nthat even so late as the year before the commencement of the last war,\r\nhe bought up a coffle of slaves and drove them down to Louisiana for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nThomas N. Gadsden, Esq. the principal slave auctioneer in Charleston,\r\nS.C. is of one of the first families in the state, and moves in the\r\nvery highest class of society there. He is a descendant of the\r\ndistinguished General Gadsden of revolutionary memory, the most\r\nprominent southern member in the Continental Congress of 1765, and\r\nafterwards elected lieutenant governor and then governor of the state.\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Gadsden, rector of St. Phillip's Church, Charleston, and\r\nthe Rev. Phillip Gadsden, both prominent Episcopal clergymen in South\r\nCarolina, and Colonel James Gadsden of the United States army, after\r\nwhom a county in Florida was recently named, are all brothers of this\r\nThomas N. Gadsden, Esq. the largest slave auctioneer in the state,\r\nunder whose hammer, men, women and children go off by thousands; its\r\nstroke probably sunders _daily_, husbands and wives, parents and\r\nchildren, brothers and sisters, perhaps to see each other's faces no\r\nmore. Now who supply the auction table of this Thomas N. Gadsden, Esq.\r\nwith its loads of human merchandize? These same detested 'soul\r\ndrivers' forsooth! They prowl through the country, buy, catch, and\r\nfetter them, and drive their chained coffles up to his stand, where\r\nThomas N. Gadsden, Esq. knocks them off to the highest bidder, to\r\nEx-Governor Butler perhaps, or to Ex-Governor Hayne, or to Hon. Robert\r\nBarnwell Rhett, or to his own reverend brother, Dr. Gadsden. Now this\r\nhigh born, wholesale _soul-seller_ doubtless despises the retail\r\n'soul-drivers' who give him their custom, and so does the wholesale\r\ngrocer, the drizzling tapster who sneaks up to his counter for a keg\r\nof whiskey to dole out under a shanty in two cent glasses; and both\r\nfor the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe plea that the 'public opinion' among the highest classes of\r\nsociety at the south is mild and considerate towards the slaves, that\r\n_they_ do not overwork, underfeed, neglect when old and sick, scantily\r\nclothe, badly lodge, and half shelter their slaves; that _they_ do not\r\nbarbarously flog, load with irons, imprison in the stocks, brand and\r\nmaim them; hunt them when runaway with dogs and guns, and sunder by\r\nforce and forever the nearest kindred--is shown, by almost every page\r\nof this work, to be an assumption, not only utterly groundless, but\r\ndirectly opposed to masses of irrefragable evidence. If the reader\r\nwill be at the pains to review the testimony recorded on the foregoing\r\npages he will find that a very large proportion of the atrocities\r\ndetailed were committed, not by the most ignorant and lowest classes\r\nof society, but by persons 'of property and standing,' by masters and\r\nmistresses belonging to the 'upper classes,' by persons in the learned\r\nprofessions, by civil, judicial, and military officers, by the\r\n_literati_, by the fashionable elite and persons of more than ordinary\r\n'respectability' and external morality--large numbers of whom are\r\nprofessors of religion.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the testimony of Sarah M. Grimké, and\r\nAngelina G. Weld, was confined exclusively to the details of slavery\r\nas exhibited in the _highest classes of society_, mainly in\r\nCharleston, S.C. See their testimony pp. 22-24 and 52-57. The former\r\nhas furnished us with the following testimony in addition to that\r\nalready given.\r\n\r\n\"Nathaniel Heyward of Combahee, S.C., one of the wealthiest planters\r\nin the state, stated, in conversation with some other planters who\r\nwere complaining of the idle and lazy habits of their slaves, and the\r\ndifficulty of ascertaining whether their sickness was real or\r\npretended, and the loss they suffered from their frequent absence on\r\nthis account from their work, said, 'I never lose a day's work: it is\r\nan _established_ rule on my plantations that the tasks of all the sick\r\nnegroes _shall be done by those who are well in addition to their\r\nown_. By this means a vigilant supervision is kept up by the slaves\r\nover each other, and they take care that nothing but real sickness\r\nkeeps any one out of the field.' I spent several winters in the\r\nneighborhood of Nathaniel Heyward's plantations, and well remember his\r\ncharacter as a severe task master. _I was present when the above\r\nstatement was made_.\"\r\n\r\nThe cool barbarity of such a regulation is hardly surpassed by the\r\nworst edicts of the Roman Caligula--especially when we consider that\r\nthe plantations of this man were in the neighborhood of the Combahee\r\nriver, one of the most unhealthy districts in the low country of South\r\nCarolina; further, that large numbers of his slaves worked in the\r\n_rice marshes_, or 'swamps' as they are called in that state--and that\r\nduring six months of the year, so fatal to health is the malaria of\r\nthe swamps in that region that the planters and their families\r\ninvariably abandon their plantations, regarding it as downright\r\npresumption to spend a single day upon them 'between the frosts' of\r\nthe early spring and the last of November.\r\n\r\nThe reader may infer the high standing of Mr. Heyward in South\r\nCarolina, from the fact that he was selected with four other\r\nfreeholders to constitute a Court for the trial of the conspirators in\r\nthe insurrection plot at Charleston, in 1822. Another of the\r\nindividuals chosen to constitute that court was Colonel Henry Deas,\r\nnow president of the Board of Trustees of Charleston College, and a\r\nfew years since a member of the Senate of South Carolina. From a late\r\ncorrespondence in the \"Greenvile (S.C.) Mountaineer,\" between Rev.\r\nWilliam M. Wightman, a professor in Randolph, Macon, College, and a\r\nnumber of the citizens of Lodi, South Carolina, it appears that the\r\ncruelty of this Colonel Deas to his slaves, is proverbial in South\r\nCarolina, so much that Professor Wightman, in the sermon which\r\noccasioned the correspondence, spoke of the Colonel's inhumanity to\r\nhis slaves as a matter of perfect notoriety.\r\n\r\nAnother South Carolina slaveholder, Hon. Whitmarsh B. Seabrook,\r\nrecently, we believe, Lieut. Governor of the state, gives the\r\nfollowing testimony to his own inhumanity, and his certificate of the\r\n'public opinion' among South Carolina slaveholders 'of high degree.'\r\n\r\nIn an essay on the management of slaves, read before the Agricultural\r\nSociety of St. Johns, S.C. and published by the Society, Charleston,\r\n1834, Mr. S. remarks:\r\n\r\n\"I consider _imprisonment in the stocks at night_, with or without\r\nhard labor in the day, as a powerful auxiliary in the cause of _good_\r\ngovernment. To the correctness of this opinion _many_ can bear\r\ntestimony. EXPERIENCE has convinced ME that there is no punishment to\r\nwhich the slave looks with more _horror_.\"\r\n\r\nThe advertisements of the Professors in the Medical Colleges of South\r\nCarolina, published with comments--on pp. 169, 170, are additional\r\nillustrations of the 'public opinion' of the _literati_.\r\n\r\nThat the 'public opinion' of _the highest class of society_ in South\r\nCarolina, regards slaves a mere _cattle_, is shown by the following\r\nadvertisement, which we copy from the \"Charleston (S.C.) Mercury\" of\r\nMay 16:\r\n\r\n\"NEGROES FOR SALE.--A girl about twenty years of age, (raised in\r\nVirginia,) and her two female children, one four and the other two\r\nyear old--is remarkably strong and healthy--never having had a day's\r\nsickness, with the exception of the small pox, in her life. The\r\nchildren are fine and healthy. She is VERY PROLIFIC IN HER GENERATING\r\nQUALITIES, _and affords a rare opportunity to any person who wishes to\r\nraise a family of strong and healthy servants for their own use._\r\n\r\n\"Any person wishing to purchase will please leave their address at the\r\nMercury office.\"\r\n\r\nThe Charleston Mercury, in which this advertisement appears, _is the\r\nleading political paper in South Carolina_, and is well known to be\r\nthe political organ of Messrs. Calhoun, Rhett, Pickens, and others of\r\nthe most prominent politicians in the state. Its editor, John Stewart,\r\nEsq., is a lawyer of Charleston, and of a highly respectable family.\r\nHe is a brother-in-law of Hon. Robert Barnwell Rhett, the late\r\nAttorney-General, now a Member of Congress, and Hon. James Rhett, a\r\nleading member of the Senate of South Carolina; his wife is a niece of\r\nthe late Governor Smith, of North Carolina, and of the late Hon. Peter\r\nSmith, Intendant (Mayor) of the city of Charleston; and a cousin of\r\nthe late Hon. Thomas S. Grimké.\r\n\r\nThe circulation of the 'Mercury' among the wealthy, the literary, and\r\nthe fashionable, is probably much larger than that of any other paper\r\nin the state.\r\n\r\nThese facts in connection with the preceding advertisement, are a\r\nsufficient exposition of the 'public opinion' towards slaves,\r\nprevalent in these classes of society.\r\n\r\nThe following scrap of 'public opinion' in Florida, is instructive. We\r\ntake it from the Florida Herald, June 23, 1838:\r\n\r\nRanaway from my plantation, on Monday night, the 13th instant, a negro\r\nfellow named Ben; eighteen years of age, polite when spoken to, and\r\nspeaks very good English for a negro. As I have traced him out in\r\nseveral places in town, I am certain he is harbored. This notice is\r\ngiven that I am determined, that whenever he is taken, _to punish him\r\ntill he informs me_ who has given him food and protection, and _I\r\nshall apply the law of Judge Lynch to my own satisfaction_, on those\r\nconcerned in his concealment.\r\n\r\nA. WATSON.\r\nJune 16, 1838.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, who is this A. Watson, who proclaims through a newspaper, his\r\ndetermination to _put to the torture_ this youth of eighteen, and to\r\nLynch to his 'satisfaction' whoever has given a cup of cold water to\r\nthe panting fugitive. Is he some low miscreant beneath public\r\ncontempt? Nay, verily, he is a 'gentleman of property and standing,'\r\none of the wealthiest planters and largest slaveholders in Florida. He\r\nresides in the vicinity of St. Augustine, and married the daughter of\r\nthe late Thomas C. Morton, Esq. one of the first merchants in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nWe may mention in this connection the well known fact, that many\r\nwealthy planters make it a _rule never to employ a physician among\r\ntheir slaves_. Hon. William Smith, Senator in Congress, from South\r\nCarolina, from 1816 to 1823, and afterwards from 1826 to 1831, is one\r\nof this number. He owns a number of large plantations in the south\r\nwestern states. One of these, borders upon the village of Huntsville,\r\nAlabama. The people of that village can testify that it is a part of\r\nJudge Smith's _system_ never to employ a physician _even in the most\r\nextreme cases_. If the medical skill of the overseer, or of the slaves\r\nthemselves, can contend successfully with the disease, they live, if\r\nnot, _they die_. At all events, a physician is _not to be called_.\r\nJudge Smith was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates three years since.\r\n\r\nThe reader will recall a similar fact in the testimony of Rev. W.T.\r\nAllan, son of Rev. Dr. Allan, of Huntsville, (see p. 47,) who says\r\nthat Colonel Robert H. Watkins, a wealthy planter, in Alabama, and a\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTOR in 1836, who works on his plantations three\r\nhundred slaves, 'After employing a physician for some time among his\r\nnegroes, he ceased to do so, alledging as the reason, that it was\r\n_cheaper to lose a few negroes every year than to pay a physician_.'\r\n\r\nIt is a fact perfectly notorious, that the late General Wade Hampton,\r\nof South Carolina, who was the largest slaveholder in the United\r\nStates, and probably the wealthiest man south of the Potomac, was\r\n_excessively cruel_ in the treatment of his slaves. The anecdote of\r\nhim related by a clergyman, on page 29, is perfectly characteristic.\r\n\r\nFor instances of barbarous inhumanity of various kinds, and manifested\r\nby persons BELONGING TO THE MOST RESPECTABLE CIRCLES OF SOCIETY, the\r\nreader can consult the following references:--Testimony of Rev. John\r\nGraham, p. 25, near the bottom; of Mr. Poe, p. 26, middle; of Rev. J.\r\nO. Choules, p. 39, middle; of Rev. Dr. Channing, p. 41, top; of Mr.\r\nGeorge A. Avery, p. 44, bottom; of Rev. W.T.

Smith p. 102.\r\n\r\nThe preceding are but a few of a large number of similar cases\r\ncontained in the foregoing testimonies. The slaveholder mentioned by\r\nMr. Ladd, p. 86, who knocked down a slave and afterwards piled brush\r\nupon his body, and consumed it, held the hand of a female slave in the\r\nfire till it was burned so as to be useless for life, and confessed to\r\nMr. Ladd, that he had killed _four_ slaves, had been a _member of the\r\nSenate of Georgia_ and a _clergyman_. The slaveholder who whipped a\r\nfemale slave to death in St. Louis, in 1837, as stated by Mr. Cole,\r\np. 69, was a _Major in the United States Army_. One of the physicians\r\nwho was an abettor of the tragedy on the Brassos, in which a slave was\r\ntortured to death, and another so that he barely lived, (see Rev. Mr.\r\nSmith's testimony, p. 102.) was Dr. Anson Jones, a native of\r\nConnecticut, who was soon after appointed minister plenipotentiary\r\nfrom Texas to this government, and now resides at Washington city. The\r\nslave mistress at Lexington, Ky., who, as her husband testifies, has\r\nkilled six of his slaves, (see testimony of Mr. Clarke, p. 87,) is the\r\nwife of Hon. Fielding S. Turner, late judge of the criminal court of\r\nNew Orleans, and one of the wealthiest slaveholders in Kentucky.\r\nLilburn Lewis, who deliberately chopped in pieces his slave George,\r\nwith a broad-axe, (see testimony of Rev. Mr. Dickey, p. 93) was a\r\nwealthy slaveholder, and a nephew of President Jefferson. Rev. Francis\r\nHawley, who was a general agent of the Baptist State Convention of\r\nNorth Carolina, confesses (see p. 47,) that while residing in that\r\nstate he once went out with his hounds and rifle, to hunt fugitive\r\nslaves. But instead of making further reference to testimony already\r\nbefore the reader, we will furnish additional instances of the\r\nbarbarous cruelty which is tolerated and sanctioned by the 'upper\r\nclasses' of society at the south; we begin with clergymen, and other\r\nofficers and members of churches.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may judge of the degree of 'protection' which slaves\r\nreceive from 'public opinion,' and among the members and ministers of\r\nprofessed christian churches, we insert the following illustrations.\r\n\r\nExtract from an editorial article in the \"Lowell (Mass.) Observer\" a\r\nreligious paper edited at the time (1833) by the Rev. DANIEL S.\r\nSOUTHMAYD, who recently died in Texas.\r\n\r\n\"We have been among the slaves at the south. We took pains to make\r\ndiscoveries in respect to the evils of slavery. We formed our\r\nsentiments on the subject of the cruelties exercised towards the\r\nslaves from having witnessed them. We now affirm that we never saw a\r\nman, who had never been at the south, who thought as much of the\r\ncruelties practiced on the slaves, as we _know_ to be a fact.\r\n\r\n\"A slave whom I loved for his kindness and the amiableness of his\r\ndisposition, and who belonged to the family where I resided, happened\r\nto stay out _fifteen minutes longer_ than he had permission to stay.\r\nIt was a mistake--it was _unintentional_. But what was the penalty? He\r\nwas sent to the house of correction with the order that he should have\r\n_thirty lashes upon his naked body with a knotted rope!!!_ He was\r\nbrought home and laid down in the stoop, in the back of the house, in\r\n_the sun, upon the floor_. And there he lay, with more the appearance\r\nof a rotten carcass than a living man, for four days before he could\r\ndo more than move. And who was this inhuman being calling God's\r\nproperty his own, and ruing it as he would not have dared to use a\r\nbeast? You may say he was a tiger--one of the more wicked sort, and\r\nthat we must not judge others by him. _He was a professor of that\r\nreligion which will pour upon the willing slaveholder the retribution\r\ndue to his sin_.\r\n\r\n\"We wish to mention another fact, which our own eyes saw and our own\r\nears heard. We were called to evening prayers. The family assembled\r\naround the altar of their accustomed devotions. There was one female\r\n_slave_ present, who belonged to another master, but who had been\r\nhired for the day and tarried to attend family worship. The precious\r\nBible was opened, and nearly half a chapter had been read, when the\r\neye of the master, who was reading, observed that the new female\r\nservant, instead of being seated like his own slaves, _flat upon the\r\nfloor_, was standing in a stooping posture upon her feet. He told her\r\nto sit down on the floor. She said it was not her custom at home. He\r\nordered her again to do it. She replied that her master did not\r\nrequire it. Irritated by this answer, he repeatedly _struck her upon\r\nthe head with the very Bible he held in his hand_. And not content\r\nwith this, he seized his cane and _caned her down stairs most\r\nunmercifully_. He then returned to resume his profane work, but we\r\nneed not say that _all_ the family were not there. Do you ask again,\r\nwho was this wicked man? _He was a professor of religion!!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. HUNTINGTON LYMAN, late pastor of the Free Church in Buffalo, New\r\nYork, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Walking one day in New Orleans with a professional gentleman, who was\r\neducated in Connecticut, we were met by a black man; the gentleman was\r\ngreatly incensed with the black man for passing so _near_ him, and\r\nturning upon him _he pushed him with violence off walk into the\r\nstreet_. This man was a professor of religion.\"\r\n\r\n(And _we_ add, a member, and if we mistake not an officer of the\r\nPresbyterian Church which was established there by Rev. Joel Parker,\r\nand which was then under his teachings-ED.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. EZEKIEL BIRDSEYE, a gentleman of known probity, in Cornwall,\r\nLitchfield county, Conn. gives the testimony which follows:--\r\n\r\n\"A BAPTIST CLERGYMAN in Laurens District, S.C. WHIPPED HIS SLAVE TO\r\nDEATH, whom he _suspected_ of having stolen about sixty dollars. The\r\nslave was in the prime of life and was purchased a few weeks before\r\nfor $800 of a slave trader from Virginia or Maryland. The coroner, Wm.\r\nIrby, at whose house I was then boarding, _told me_, that on reviewing\r\nthe dead body, he found it _beat to a jelly from head to foot_. The\r\nmaster's wife discovered the money a day or two after the death of the\r\nslave. She had herself removed it from where it was placed, not\r\nknowing what it was, as it was tied up in a thick envelope. I happened\r\nto be present when the trial of this man took place, at Laurens Court\r\nHouse. His daughter testified that her father untied the slave, when\r\nhe appeared to be failing, and gave him cold water to drink, of which\r\nhe took freely. His counsel pleaded that his death _might_ have been\r\ncaused by drinking cold water in a state of excitement. The Judge\r\ncharged the jury, that it would be their duty to find the defendant\r\nguilty, if they believed the death was caused by the whipping; but if\r\nthey were of opinion that drinking cold water caused the death, they\r\nwould find him not guilty! The jury found him--NOT GUILTY!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. JEREMIAH S. WAUGH, a physician in Somerville, Butler county, Ohio,\r\ntestifies as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1825, I boarded with the Rev. John Mushat, a Seceder\r\nminister, and principal of an academy in Iredel county, N.C. He had\r\nslaves, and was in the habit of restricting them on the Sabbath. One\r\nof his slaves, however, ventured to disobey his injunctions. The\r\noffence was he went away on Sabbath evening, and did not return till\r\nMonday morning. About the time we were called to breakfast, the Rev.\r\ngentleman was engaged in chastising him for _breaking the Sabbath_. He\r\ndetermined not to submit--attempted to escape by flight. The master\r\nimmediately took down his gun and pursued him--levelled his instrument\r\nof death, and told him, if he did not stop instantly _he would blow\r\nhim through_. The poor slave returned to the house and submitted\r\nhimself to the lash; and the good master, while YET PALE WITH RAGE,\r\n_sat down to the table, and with a trembling voice_ ASKED GOD'S\r\nBLESSING!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter was sent by Capt. JACOB DUNHAM, of New York city,\r\nto a slaveholder in Georgetown, D.C. more than twenty years since:\r\n\r\n\"Georgetown, June 13, 1815.\r\n\r\n\"Dear sir--Passing your house yesterday, I beheld a scene of cruelty\r\nseldom witnessed--that was the brutal chastisement of your negro girl,\r\n_lashed to a ladder and beaten in an inhuman manner, too bad to\r\ndescribe_. My blood chills while I contemplate the subject. This has\r\nled me to investigate your character from your neighbors; who inform\r\nme that you have _caused the death_ of one negro man, whom you struck\r\nwith a sledge for some trivial fault--that you have beaten another\r\nblack girl with such severity that the _splinters_ remained in her\r\nback for some weeks after you sold her--and many other acts of\r\nbarbarity, too lengthy to enumerate. And to my great surprise, I find\r\nyou are a _professor of the Christian religion!_\r\n\r\n\"You will naturally inquire, why I meddle with your family affairs. My\r\nanswer is, the cause of humanity and a sense of my duty requires\r\nit.--these hasty remarks I leave you to reflect on the subject; but\r\nwish you to remember, that there is an all-seeing eye who knows all\r\nour faults and will reward us according to our deeds.\r\n\r\nI remain, sir, yours, &c\r\n\r\nJACOB DUNHAM.\r\nMaster of the brig Cyrus, of N.Y.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. SYLVESTER COWLES, pastor of the Presbyterian church in Fredonia,\r\nN.Y. says:--\r\n\r\n\"A young man, a member of the church in Conewango, went to Alabama\r\nlast year, to reside as a clerk in an uncle's store. When he had been\r\nthere about nine months, he wrote his father that he must return home.\r\nTo see members of the same church sit at the communion table of our\r\nLord one day, and the next to see one seize any weapon and knock the\r\nother down, _as he had seen_, he _could not_ live there. His good\r\nfather forthwith gave him permission to return home.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of the shameless hardihood with which a\r\nprofessed minister of the Gospel, and editor of a religious paper,\r\nassumes the right to hold God's image as a chattel. It is from the\r\nSouthern Christian Herald:--\r\n\r\n\"It is stated in the Georgetown Union, that a negro, supposed to have\r\ndied of cholera, when that disease prevailed in Charleston, was\r\ncarried to the public burying ground to be interred; but before\r\ninterment signs of life appeared, and, by the use of proper means, he\r\nwas restored to health. And now the man who first perceived the signs\r\nof life in the slave, and that led to his preservation, claims the\r\nproperty as his own, and is about bringing suit for its recovery. As\r\nwell might a man who rescued his neighbor's slave, or his _horse_,\r\nfrom drowning, or who extinguished the flames that would otherwise\r\nsoon have burnt down his neighbor's house, claim the _property_ as his\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nRev. GEORGE BOURNE, of New York city, late Editor of the \"Protestant\r\nVindicator,\" who was a preacher seven years in Virginia, gives the\r\nfollowing testimony.[39]\r\n\r\n\"Benjamin Lewis, who was an elder in the Presbyterian church, engaged\r\na carpenter to repair and enlarge his house. After some time had\r\nelapsed, Kyle, the builder, was awakened very early in the morning by\r\na most piteous moaning and shrieking. He arose, and following the\r\nsound, discovered a colored woman nearly naked, tied to a fence, while\r\nLewis was lacerating her. Kyle instantly commanded the slave driver to\r\ndesist. Lewis maintained his jurisdiction over his slaves, and\r\nthreatened Kyle that he would punish him for his interference.\r\nFinally Kyle obtained the release of the victim.\r\n\r\n\"A second and a third scene of the same kind occurred, and on the\r\nthird occasion the altercation almost produced a battle between the\r\nelder and the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"Kyle immediately arranged his affairs, packed up his tools and\r\nprepared to depart. 'Where are you going?' demanded Lewis. 'I am\r\ngoing home;' said Kyle. 'Then I will pay you nothing for what you\r\nhave done,' retorted the slave driver, 'unless you complete your\r\ncontract.'  The carpenter went away with this edifying declaration, 'I\r\nwill not stay here a day longer; for I expect the fire of God will\r\ncome down and burn you up altogether, and I do not choose to go to\r\nhell with you.'  Through hush-money and promises not to whip the women\r\nany more, I believe Kyle returned and completed his engagement.\r\n\r\n\"James Kyle of Harrisonburg, Virginia, frequently narrated that\r\ncircumstance, and his son, the carpenter, confirmed it with all the\r\nminute particulars combined with his temporary residence on the\r\nShenandoah river.\r\n\r\n\"John M'Cue of Augusta county, Virginia, a _Presbyterian preacher_,\r\nfrequently on the Lord's day morning, tied up his slaves and whipped\r\nthem; and left them bound, while he went to the meeting house and\r\npreached--and after his return home repeated his scourging. That\r\nfact, with others more heinous, was known to all persons in his\r\ncongregation and around the vicinity; and so far from being censured\r\nfor it, he and his brethren justified it as essential to preserve\r\ntheir 'domestic institutions.'\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Pence, of Rockingham county, Virginia, used to boast,--'I am the\r\nbest hand to whip a _wench_ in the whole county.'  She used to pinion\r\nthe girls to a post in the yard on the Lord's day morning, scourge\r\nthem, put on the '_negro plaster_,' salt, pepper, and vinegar, leave\r\nthem tied, and walk away to church as demure as a nun, and after\r\nservice repeat her flaying, if she felt the whim. I once expostulated\r\nwith her upon her cruelly. 'Mrs. Pence, how can you whip your girls\r\nso publicly and disturb your neighbors so on the Lord's day morning.'\r\nHer answer was memorable. 'If I were to whip them on any other day I\r\nshould lose a day's work; but by whipping them on Sunday, their backs\r\nget well enough by Monday morning.'  That woman, if alive, is\r\ndoubtless a member of the church now, as then.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. Dr. Staughton, formerly of Philadelphia, often stated, that when\r\nhe lived at Georgetown, S.C. he could tell the doings of one of the\r\nslaveholders of the Baptist church there by his prayers at the prayer\r\nmeeting. 'If,' said he, 'that man was upon good terms with his\r\nslaves, his words were cold and heartless as frost; if he had been\r\nwhipping a man, he would pray with life; but if he had left a woman\r\nwhom he had been flogging, tied to a post in his cellar, with a\r\ndetermination to go back and torture her again, O! how he would pray!'\r\n The Rev. Cyrus P. Grosvenor of Massachusetts can confirm the above\r\nstatement by Dr. Staughton.\r\n\r\n\"William Wilson, a Presbyterian preacher of Augusta county, Virginia,\r\nhad a young colored girl who was constitutionally unhealthy. As no\r\nmeans to amend her were availing, he sold her to a member of his\r\ncongregation, and in the usual style of human flesh dealers, warranted\r\nher 'sound,' &c. The fraud was instantly discovered; but he would not\r\nrefund the amount. A suit was commenced, and was long continued, and\r\nfinally the plaintiff recovered the money out of which he had been\r\nswindled by slave-trading with his own preacher. No Presbytery\r\ncensured him, although Judge Brown, the chancellor, severely condemned\r\nthe imposition.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1811, Johab Graham, a preacher, lived with Alexander\r\nNelson a Presbyterian elder, near Stanton, Virginia, and he informed\r\nme that a man had appeared before Nelson, who was a magistrate, and\r\nswore falsely against his slave,--that the elder ordered him\r\nthirty-nine lashes. All that wickedness was done as an excuse for his\r\ndissipated owner to obtain money. A negro trader had offered him a\r\nconsiderable sum for the 'boy,' and under the pretence of saving him\r\nfrom the punishment of the law, he was trafficked away from his woman\r\nand children to another state. The magistrate was aware of the\r\nperjury, and the whole abomination, but all the truth uttered by every\r\ncolored person in the southern states would not be of any avail\r\nagainst the notorious false swearing of the greatest white villain who\r\never cursed the world. 'How,' said Johab Graham, can I preach\r\nto-morrow?' I replied, 'Very well; go and thunder the doctrine of\r\nretribution in their ears, Obadiah 15, till by the divine blessing you\r\nkill or cure them. My friends, John M. Nelson of Hillsborough, Ohio,\r\nSamuel Linn, and Robert Herron, and others of the same vicinity, could\r\n'make both the ears of every one who heareth them tingle' with the\r\naccounts which they can give of slave-driving by professors of\r\nreligion in the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"In 1815, near Frederick, in Maryland, a most barbarous planter was\r\nkilled in a fit of desperation, by four of his slaves _in\r\nself-defence_. It was declared by those slaves while in prison that,\r\nbesides his atrocities among their female associates, he had\r\ndeliberately butchered a number of his slaves. The four men were\r\nmurdered by law, to appease the popular clamor. I saw them executed on\r\nthe twenty-eighth day of Jan'y, 1816. The facts I received from the\r\nRev. Patrick Davidson of Frederick, who constantly visited them during\r\ntheir imprisonment--and who became an abolitionist in consequence of\r\nthe disclosures which he heard from those men in the jail. The name of\r\nthe planter is not distinctly recollected, but it can be known by a\r\ninspection of the record of the trial in the clerk's office,\r\nFrederick.\r\n\r\n\"A minister of Virginia, still living, and whose name must not be\r\nmentioned for fear of Nero Preston and his confederate-hanging\r\nmyrmidons, informed me of this fact in 1815, in his own house. 'A\r\nmember of my church, said he, lately whipped a colored youth to death.\r\nWhat shall I do?' I answered, 'I hope you do not mean to continue him\r\nin your church.' That minister replied, 'How can we help it'\r\nWe dare not call him to an account. We have no legal testimony.'\r\nTheir communion season was then approaching. I addressed his\r\nwife,--'Mrs. ---- do you mean to sit at the Lord's table with that\r\nmurderer?'--,'Not I,' she answered: 'I would as soon commune with the\r\ndevil himself.' The slave killer was equally unnoticed by the civil\r\nand ecclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\n\"John Baxter, a Presbyterian elder, the brother of that slaveholding\r\ndoctor in divinity, George A. Baxter, held as a slave the wife of a\r\nBaptist colored preacher, familiarly called 'Uncle Jack.' In a late\r\nperiod of pregnancy he scourged her so that the lives of herself and\r\nher unborn child were considered in jeopardy. Uncle Jack was advised\r\nto obtain the liberation of his wife. Baxter finally agreed, I think,\r\nto sell the woman and her children, three of them, I believe for six\r\nhundred dollars, and an additional hundred if the unborn child\r\nsurvived a certain period after its birth. Uncle Jack was to pay one\r\nhundred dollars per annum for his wife and children for seven years,\r\nand Baxter held a sort of mortgage upon them for the payment. Uncle\r\nJack showed me his back in furrows like a ploughed field. His master\r\nused to whip up the flesh, then beat it downwards, and then apply the\r\n'negro plaster,' salt, pepper, mustard, and vinegar, until all Jack's\r\nback was almost as hard and unimpressible as the bones. There is\r\nslaveholding religion! A Presbyterian elder receiving from a Baptist\r\npreacher seven hundred dollars for his wife and children. James Kyle\r\nand uncle Jack used to tell that story with great Christian\r\nsensibility; and uncle Jack would weep tears of anguish over his\r\nwife's piteous tale, and tears of ecstasy at the same moment that he\r\nwas free, and that soon, by the grace of God, his wife and children,\r\nas he said, 'would be all free together.'\"\r\n\r\nRev. JAMES NOURSE, a Presbyterian clergyman of Mifflia co. Penn.,\r\nwhose father is, we believe, a slaveholder in Washington City, says,--\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Mr. M----, now of the Huntingdon Presbytery, after an absence\r\nof many months, was about visiting his old friends on what is commonly\r\ncalled the 'Eastern Shore.' Late in the afternoon, on his journey, he\r\ncalled at the house of Rev. A.C. of P----town, Md. With this brother\r\nhe had been long acquainted. Just at that juncture Mr. C. was about\r\nproceeding to whip a colored female, who was his slave. She was firmly\r\ntied to a post in FRONT of his dwelling-house. The arrival of a\r\nclerical visitor at such a time, occasioned a temporary delay in the\r\nexecution of Mr. C's purpose. But the delay was only temporary; for\r\nnot even the presence of such a guest could destroy the bloody design.\r\nThe guest interceded with all the mildness yet earnestness of a\r\nbrother and new visitor. But all in vain, 'the woman had been saucy\r\nand must be punished.' The cowhide was accordingly produced, and the\r\n_Rev. Mr. C_., a large and very stout man, applied it 'manfully' on\r\n'woman's' bare and 'shrinking flesh.' I say bare, because you know\r\nthat the slave women generally have but three or four inches of the\r\narm near the shoulder covered, and the neck is left entirely exposed.\r\nAs the cowhide moved back and forward, striking right and left, on the\r\nhead, neck and arms, at every few strokes the sympathizing guest would\r\nexclaim, 'O, brother C. desist' But brother C. pursued his brutal\r\nwork, till, after inflicting about sixty lashes, the woman was found\r\nto be suffused with blood on the hinder part of her neck, and under\r\nher frock between the shoulders. Yet this Rev. gentleman is well\r\nesteemed in the church--was, three or four years since, moderator of\r\nthe synod of Philadelphia, and yet walks abroad, feeling himself\r\nunrebuked by law or gospel. Ah, sir does not this narration give\r\nfearful force to the query--_What has the church to do with slavery_?'\r\nComment on the facts is unnecessary, yet allow me to conclude by\r\nsaying, that it is my opinion such occurrences _are not rare in the\r\nsouth_.\r\n\r\nJ.N.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. CHARLES STEWART RENSHAW, of Quincy, Illinois, in a recent letter,\r\nspeaking of his residence, for a period, in Kentucky, says--\r\n\r\n\"In a conversation with Mr. Robert Willis, he told me that his negro\r\ngirl had run away from him some time previous. He was convinced that\r\nshe was lurking round, and he watched for her. He soon found the place\r\nof her concealment, drew her from it, got a rope, and tied her hands\r\nacross each other, then threw the rope over a beam in the kitchen, and\r\nhoisted her up by the wrists; 'and,' said he, 'I whipped her there\r\ntill I made the lint fly, I tell you.' I asked him the meaning of\r\nmaking 'the lint fly,' and he replied, '_till the blood flew_.' I spoke\r\nof the iniquity and cruelty of slavery, and of its immediate\r\nabandonment. He confessed it an evil, but said, 'I am a\r\n_colonizationist_--I believe in that scheme.' Mr. Willis is a teacher\r\nof sacred music, and a member of the Presbyterian Church in Lexington,\r\nKentucky.\"\r\n\r\nMr. R. speaking of the PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER and church where he\r\nresided, says:\r\n\r\n\"The minister and all the church members held slaves. Some were\r\ntreated kindly, others harshly. _There was not a shade of difference_\r\nbetween their slaves and those of their _infidel_ neighbors, either in\r\ntheir physical, intellectual, or moral state: in some cases they would\r\n_suffer_ in the comparison.\r\n\r\n\"In the kitchen of the minister of the church, a slave man was living\r\nin open adultery with a slave woman, who was a member of the church,\r\nwith an 'assured hope' of heaven--whilst the man's wife was on the\r\nminister's farm in Fayette county. The minister had to bring a cook\r\ndown from his farm to the place in which he was preaching. The choice\r\nwas between the wife of the man and this church member. He _left the\r\nwife_, and brought the church member to the adulterer's bed.\r\n\r\n\"A METHODIST PREACHER last fall took a load of produce down the river.\r\nAmongst other _things_ he took down five slaves. He sold them at New\r\nOrleans--he came up to Natchez--bought seven there--and took them down\r\nand sold them also. Last March he came up to preach the Gospel again.\r\nA number of persons on board the steamboat (the Tuscarora.) who had\r\nseen him in the slave-shambles in Natchez and New Orleans, and now,\r\nfor the first time, found him to be a preacher, had much sport at the\r\nexpense of 'the fine old preacher who dealt in slaves.'\r\n\r\nA non-professor of religion, in Campbell county, Ky. sold a female and\r\ntwo children to a Methodist professor, with the proviso that they\r\nshould not leave that region of country. The slave-driver came, and\r\noffered $5 more for the woman than he had given, and he sold her. She\r\nis now in the lower country, and _her orphan babes are in Kentucky_.\r\n\r\n\"I was much shocked once, to see a Presbyterian elder's wife call a\r\nlittle slave to her to kiss her feet. At first the boy hesitated--but\r\nthe command being repeated in tones not to be misunderstood, be\r\napproached timidly, knelt, and kissed her foot.\"\r\n\r\nRev. W.T. ALLAN, of Chatham, Illinois, gives the following in a letter\r\ndated Feb. 4, 1839:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Peter Vanarsdale, an elder of the Presbyterian church in\r\nCarrollton, formerly from Kentucky, told me, the other day, that a\r\nMrs. Burford, in the neighborhood of Harrodsburg, Kentucky, had\r\n_separated a woman and her children_ from their husband and father,\r\ntaking them into another state. Mrs. B. was a member of the\r\n_Presbyterian Church_. The bereaved husband and father was also a\r\nprofessor of religion.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. V. told me of a slave woman who had lost her son, separated from\r\nher by public sale. In the anguish of her soul, she gave vent to her\r\nindignation freely, and perhaps harshly. Sometime after, she wished to\r\nbecome a member of the church. Before they received her, she had to\r\nmake humble confession for speaking as she had done. _Some of the\r\nelders that received her, and required the confession, were engaged is\r\nselling the son from his mother_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following communication from the Rev. WILLIAM BARDWELL, of\r\nSandwich, Massachusetts, has just been published in Zion's Watchman,\r\nNew York city:\r\n\r\n_Mr. Editor_:--The following fact was given me last evening, from the\r\npen of a shipmaster, who has traded in several of the principal ports\r\nin the south. He is a man of unblemished character, a member of the\r\nM.E. Church in this place, and familiarly known in this town. The\r\nfacts were communicated to me last fall in a letter to his wife, with\r\na request that she would cause them to be published. I give verbatim,\r\nas they were written from the letter by brother Perry's own hand while\r\nI was in his house.\r\n\r\n\"A Methodist preacher, Wm. Whitby by name, who married in Bucksville,\r\nS.C., and by marriage came into possession of some slaves, in July,\r\n1838, was about moving to another station to preach, and wished, also,\r\nto move his family and slaves to Tennessee, much against the will of\r\nthe slaves, one of which, to get clear from him, ran into the woods\r\nafter swimming a brook. The parson took after him with his gun, which,\r\nhowever, got wet and missed fire, when he ran to a neighbor for\r\nanother gun, with the intention, as he said, of killing him: he did\r\nnot, however, catch or kill him; he chained another for fear of his\r\nrunning away also. The above particulars were related to me by William\r\nWhitby himself. THOMAS C. PERRY. March 3, 1839.\"\r\n\r\n\"I find by examining the minutes of the S.C. Conference, that there is\r\nsuch a preacher in the Conference, and brother Perry further stated to\r\nme that he was well acquainted with him, and if this statement was\r\npublished, and if it could be known where he was since the last\r\nConference, he wished a paper to be sent him containing the whole\r\naffair. He also stated to me, verbally, that the young man he\r\nattempted to shoot was about nineteen years of age, and had been shut\r\nup in a corn-house, and in the attempt of Mr. Whitby to chain him, he\r\nbroke down the door and made his escape as above mentioned, and that\r\nMr. W. was under the necessity of hiring him out for one year, with\r\nthe risk of his employer's getting him. Brother Perry conversed with\r\none of the slaves, who was so old that he thought it not profitable to\r\nremove so far, and had been sold; _he_ informed him of all the above\r\ncircumstances, and said, with tears, that he thought he had been so\r\nfaithful as to be entitled to liberty, but instead of making him free,\r\nhe had sold him to another master, besides parting one husband and\r\nwife from those ties rendered a thousand times dearer by an infant\r\nchild which was torn for ever from the husband.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BARDWELL.\r\n_Sandwich, Mass._, March 4, 1839.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAM POE, till recently a slaveholder in Virginia, now an elder\r\nin the Presbyterian Church at Delhi, Ohio, gives the following\r\ntestimony:--\r\n\r\n\"An elder in the Presbyterian Church in Lynchburg had a most faithful\r\nservant, whom he flogged severely and sent him to prison, and had him\r\nconfined as a felon a number of days, for being _saucy_. Another elder\r\nof the same church, an auctioneer, habitually sold slaves at his\r\nstand--very frequently _parted families_--would often go into the\r\ncountry to sell slaves on execution and otherwise; when remonstrated\r\nwith, he justified himself, saying, 'it was his business;' the church\r\nalso justified him on the same ground.\r\n\r\n\"A Doctor Duval, of Lynchburg, Va. got offended with a very faithful,\r\nworthy servant, and immediately sold him to a negro trader, to be\r\ntaken to New Orleans; Duval still keeping the wife of the man as his\r\nslave. This Duval was a professor of religion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SAMUEL HALL, a teacher in Marietta College, Ohio, says, in a\r\nrecent letter:--\r\n\r\n\"A student in Marietta College, from Mississippi, a professor of\r\nreligion, and in every way worthy of entire confidence, made to me the\r\nfollowing statement. [If his name were published it would probably\r\ncost him his life.]\r\n\r\n\"When I was in the family of the Rev. James Martin, of Louisville,\r\nWinston county, Mississippi, in the spring of 1838, Mrs. Martin became\r\noffended at a female slave, because she did not move faster. She\r\ncommanded her to do so; the girl quickened her pace; again she was\r\nordered to move faster, or, Mrs. M. declared, she would break the\r\nbroomstick over her head. Again the slave quickened her pace; but not\r\ncoming up to the _maximum_ desired by Mrs. M. the latter declared she\r\nwould _see_ whether she (the slave) could move or not: and, going into\r\nanother apartment, she brought in a raw hide, awaiting the return of\r\nher husband for its application. In this instance I know not what was\r\nthe final result, but I have heard the sound of the raw-hide in at\r\nleast _two_ other instances, applied by this same reverend gentleman\r\nto the back of his _female_ servant.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hall adds--\"The name of my informant must be suppressed, as\" he\r\nsays, \"there are those who would cut my throat in a moment, if the\r\ninformation I give were to be coupled with my name.\" Suffice it to say\r\nthat he is a professor of religion, a native of Virginia, and a\r\nstudent of Marietta College, whose character will bear the strictest\r\nscrutiny. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"In 1838, at Charlestown, Va. I conversed with several members of the\r\nchurch under the care of the Rev. Mr. Brown, of the same place. Taking\r\noccasion to speak of slavery, and of the sin of slaveholding, to one\r\nof them who was a lady, she replied, \"I am a slaveholder, and I\r\n_glory_ in it.\" I had a conversation, a few days after, with the\r\npastor himself, concerning the state of religion in his church, and\r\nwho were the most exemplary members in it. The pastor mentioned\r\nseveral of those who were of that description; the _first_ of whom,\r\nhowever, was the identical lady who _gloried_ in being a slaveholder!\r\nThat church numbers nearly two hundred members.\r\n\r\n\"Another lady, who was considered as devoted a Christian as any in the\r\nsame church, but who was in poor health, was accustomed to flog some\r\nof her female domestics with a raw-hide till she was exhausted, and\r\nthen go and lie down till her strength was recruited, rising again and\r\nresuming the flagellation. This she considered as not at all\r\nderogatory to her Christian character.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JOEL S. BINGHAM, of Cornwall, Vermont, lately a student in\r\nMiddlebury College, and a member of the Congregational Church, spent a\r\nfew weeks in Kentucky, in the summer of 1838. He relates the following\r\noccurrence which took place in the neighborhood where he resided, and\r\nwas a matter of perfect notoriety in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. Mr. Lewis, a Baptist minister in the vicinity of Frankfort, Ky.\r\nhad a slave that ran away, but was retaken and brought back to his\r\nmaster, who threatened him with punishment for making an attempt to\r\nescape. Though terrified the slave immediately attempted to run away\r\nagain. Mr. L. commanded him to stop, but he did not obey. _Mr. L. then\r\ntook a gun, loaded with small shot and fired at the slave, who fell_;\r\nbut was not killed, and afterward recovered. Mr. L. did not probably\r\nintend to kill the slave, as it was his legs which were aimed at and\r\nreceived the contents of the gun. The master asserted that he was\r\ndriven to this necessity to maintain his authority. This took place\r\nabout the first of July, 1838.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is given upon the authority of Rev. ORANGE SCOTT, of\r\nLowell, Mass. for many years a presiding elder in the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. Joseph Hough, a Baptist minister, formerly of Springfield, Mass.\r\nnow of Plainfield, N.H. while traveling in the south, a few years ago,\r\nput up one night with a Methodist family, and spent the Sabbath with\r\nthem. While there, one of the female slaves did something which\r\ndispleased her mistress. She took a chisel and mallet, and very\r\ndeliberately cut off one of her toes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVE BREEDING AN INDEX OF PUBLIC 'OPINION' AMONG THE 'HIGHEST CLASS\r\nOF SOCIETY' IN VIRGINIA AND OTHER NORTHERN SLAVE STATES.\r\n\r\nBut we shall be told, that 'slave-breeders' are regarded with\r\ncontempt, and the business of slave breeding is looked upon as\r\ndespicable; and the hot disclaimer of Mr. Stevenson, our Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary at the Court of St. James, in reply to Mr. O'Connell,\r\nwho had intimated that he might be a 'slave breeder,' will doubtless\r\nbe quoted.[40] In reply, we need not say what every body knows, that\r\nif Mr. Stevenson is not a 'slave breeder,' he is a solitary exception\r\namong the large slaveholders of Virginia. What! Virginia slaveholders\r\nnot 'slave-breeders?' the pretence is ridiculous and contemptible; it\r\nis meanness, hypocrisy, and falsehood, as is abundantly proved by the\r\ntestimony which follows:--\r\n\r\nMr. GHOLSON, of Virginia, in his speech in the Legislature of that\r\nstate, Jan. 18, 1832, (see Richmond Whig,) says:--\r\n\r\n\"It has always (perhaps erroneously) been considered by steady and\r\nold-fashioned people, that the owner of land had a reasonable right to\r\nits annual profits; the owner of orchards, to their annual fruits; the\r\nowner of _brood mares_, to their product; and the owner of _female\r\nslaves, to their increase_. We have not the fine-spun intelligence,\r\nnor legal acumen, to discover the technical distinctions drawn by\r\ngentlemen. The legal maxim of '_Partus sequitur ventrem_' is coeval\r\nwith the existence of the rights of property itself, and is founded in\r\nwisdom and justice. It is on the justice and inviolability of this\r\nmaxim that the master foregoes the service of the female slave; has\r\nher nursed and attended during the period of her gestation, and raises\r\nthe helpless and infant offspring. The value of the property justifies\r\nthe expense; and I do not hesitate to say, that in its _increase\r\nconsists much of our wealth_.\"\r\n\r\nHon. THOMAS MANN RANDOLPH, of Virginia. formerly Governor of that\r\nstate, in his speech before the legislature in 1832, while speaking of\r\nthe number of slaves annually sold from Virginia to the more southern\r\nslave states, said:--\r\n\r\n\"The exportation has _averaged_ EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED for the\r\nlast twenty years. Forty years ago, the whites exceeded the colored\r\n25,000, the colored now exceed the whites 81,000; and these results\r\ntoo during an exportation of near 260,000 slaves since the year 1790,\r\nnow perhaps the fruitful progenitors of half a million in other\r\nstates. It is a practice and an increasing practice, in parts of\r\nVirginia, to rear slaves for market. How can an honorable mind, a\r\npatriot and a lover of his country, bear to see this ancient dominion\r\nconverted into one grand menagerie, where men are to be reared for\r\nmarket, like oxen for the shambles.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor DEW, now President of the University of William and Mary,\r\nVirginia, in his Review of the Debate in the Virginia Legislature,\r\n1831-2, says, p 49.\r\n\r\n\"From all the information we can obtain, we have no hesitation in\r\nsaying that upwards of six thousand [slaves] are yearly exported [from\r\nVirginia] to other states.' Again, p. 61: 'The 6000 slaves which\r\nVirginia annually sends off to the south, are a source of wealth to\r\nVirginia'--Again, p. 120: 'A full equivalent being thus left in the\r\nplace of the slave, this emigration becomes an advantage to the state,\r\nand does not check the black population as much as, at first view, we\r\nmight imagine--because it furnishes every inducement to the master to\r\nattend to the negroes, to ENCOURAGE BREEDING, and to cause the\r\n_greatest number possible to be raised._ &c.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Virginia is, in fact, a negro-raising state for other states.\"_\r\n\r\nExtract from the speech of MR. FAULKNER, in the Va. House of\r\nDelegates, 1832. [See Richmond Whig.]\r\n\r\n\"But he [Mr. Gholson,] has labored to show that the Abolition of\r\nSlavery, were it practicable, would be _impolitic_, because as the\r\ndrift of this portion of his argument runs, your slaves constitute the\r\nentire wealth of the state, all the _productive capacity_ Virginia\r\npossesses. And, sir, as things are, _I believe he is correct_. He\r\nsays, and in this he is sustained by the gentleman from Halifax, Mr.\r\nBruce, that the slaves constitute the entire available wealth at\r\npresent, of Eastern Virginia. Is it true that for 200 years the only\r\nincrease in the wealth and resources of Virginia, has been a remnant\r\nof the natural _increase_ of this miserable race?--Can it be, that on\r\nthis _increase_, she places her solo dependence? I had always\r\nunderstood that indolence and extravagance were the necessary\r\nconcomitants of slavery; but, until I heard these declarations, I had\r\nnot fully conceived the horrible extent of this evil. These gentlemen\r\nstate the fact, which the history and _present aspect of the\r\nCommowealth but too well sustain_. The gentlemen's facts and argument\r\nin support of his plea of impolicy, to me, seem rather unhappy. To me,\r\nsuch a state of things would itself be conclusive at least, that\r\nsomething, even as a measure of policy, should be done. What, sir,\r\nhave you lived for two hundred years, without personal effort or\r\nproductive industry, in extravagance and indolence, sustained alone\r\n_by the return from sales of the increase of slaves_, and retaining\r\nmerely such a number as your now impoverished lands can sustain, AS\r\nSTOCK, _depending, too, upon a most uncertain market_? When that\r\nmarket is closed, as in the nature of things it must be, what then\r\nwill become of this gentleman's hundred millions worth of slaves, AND\r\nTHE ANNUAL PRODUCT?\"\r\n\r\nIn the debates in the Virginia Convention, in 1829, Judge Upsher\r\nsaid--\"The value of slaves as an article of property [and it is in\r\nthat view only that they are legitimate subjects of taxation] _depends\r\nmuch on the state of the market abroad_. In this view, it is the value\r\nof land _abroad_, and not of land here, which furnishes the ratio. It\r\nis well known to us all, that nothing is more fluctuating than the\r\nvalue of slaves. A late law of Louisiana reduced their value 25 per\r\ncent, in two hours after its passage was known. IF IT SHOULD BE OUR\r\nLOT, AS I TRUST IT WILL BE, TO ACQUIRE THE COUNTRY OF TEXAS, THEIR\r\nPRICE WILL RISE AGAIN.\"--p. 77.\r\n\r\nMr. Goode, Of Virginia, in his speech before the Virginia Legislature,\r\nin Jan. 1832, [See Richmond Whig, of that date,] said:--\r\n\r\n\"The superior usefulness of the slaves in the south, will constitute\r\nan _effectual demand_, which will remove them from our limits. We\r\nshall send them from our state, because _it will be our interest to do\r\nso_. Our planters are already becoming farmers. Many who grew tobacco\r\nas their only staple, have already introduced, and commingled the\r\nwheat crop. They are already semi-farmers; and in the natural course\r\nof events, they must become more and more so.--As the greater quantity\r\nof rich western lands are appropriated to the production of the staple\r\nof our planters, that staple will become less profitable.--We shall\r\ngradually divert our lands from its production, until we shall become\r\nactual farmers.--Then will the necessity for slave labor diminish;\r\nthen will the effectual demand diminish, and then will the quantity of\r\nslaves diminish, until they shall be adapted to the effectual demand.\r\n\r\n\"But gentlemen are alarmed _lest the markets of other states be closed\r\nagainst the introduction of our slaves_. Sir, the demand for slave\r\nlabor MUST INCREASE through the South and West. It has been heretofore\r\nlimited by the want of capital; but when emigrants shall be relieved\r\nfrom their embarrassments, contracted by the purchase of their lands,\r\nthe annual profits of their estates, will constitute an accumulating\r\ncapital, which they will _seek to invest in labor_. That the demand\r\nfor labor must increase in proportion to the increase of capital, is\r\none of the demonstrations of political economists; and I confess, that\r\nfor the removal of slavery from Virginia, I look to the efficacy of\r\nthat principle; together with the circumstance that our southern\r\nbrethren are constrained to continue planters, by their position, soil\r\nand climate.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from Niles' Weekly Register, published at Baltimore,\r\nMd. vol. 35, p. 4.\r\n\r\n_\"Dealing in slaves has become a large business_; establishments are\r\nmade in several places in Maryland and Virginia, at which they are\r\nsold like cattle; these places of deposit are strongly built, and well\r\nsupplied with thumb-screws and gags, and ornamented with cow-skins and\r\nother whips oftentimes bloody.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nR.S. FINLEY, Esq., late General Agent of the American Colonization\r\nSociety, at a meeting in New York, 27th Feb. 1833, said:\r\n\r\n\"In Virginia and other grain-growing slave states, the blacks do not\r\nsupport themselves, and the only profit their masters derive from them\r\nis, repulsive as the idea may justly seem, in breeding them, like\r\nother live stock for the more southern states.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Dr. GRAHAM, of Fayetteville, N.C. at a Colonization Meeting,\r\nheld in that place in the fall of 1837 said:\r\n\r\n\"He had resided for 15 years in one of the largest slaveholding\r\ncounties in the state, had long and anxiously considered the subject,\r\nand still it was dark. There were nearly 7000 slaves offered in New\r\nOrleans market last winter. From Virginia alone 6000 were annually\r\nsent to the south; and from Virginia and N.C. there had gone, in the\r\nsame direction, in the last twenty years, 300,000 slaves. While not\r\n4000 had gone to Africa. What it portended, he could not predict, but\r\nhe felt deeply, that _we must awake in these states and consider the\r\nsubject_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. PHILIP DODDRIDGE, of Virginia, in his speech in the Virginia\r\nConvention, in 1829, [Debates p. 89.] said:--\r\n\r\n\"The acquisition of Texas will greatly _enhance the value of the\r\nproperty_, in question, [Virginia slaves.]\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHon C.F. MERCER, in a speech before the same Convention, in 1829,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The tables of the natural growth of the slave population demonstrate,\r\nwhen compared with the increase of its numbers in the commonwealth for\r\ntwenty years past, that an annual revenue of not less than a million\r\nand a half of dollars is derived from the exportation of a part of\r\nthis population.\" (Debates, p. 199.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. HENRY CLAY, of Ky., in his speech before the Colonization\r\nSociety, in 1829, says:\r\n\r\n\"It is believed that nowhere in the farming portion of the United\r\nStates, would slave labor be generally employed, if the proprietor\r\nwere not tempted to RAISE SLAVES BY THE HIGH PRICE OF THE SOUTHERN\r\nMARKET WHICH KEEPS IT UP IN HIS OWN.\"\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Courier, Feb. 15, 1839, speaking of the prohibition of\r\nthe African Slave-trade, while the internal slave-trade is plied,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The United States law may, and probably does, put MILLIONS _into the\r\npockets of the people living between the Roanoke, and Mason and\r\nDixon's line_; still we think it would require some casuistry to show\r\nthat _the present slave-trade from that quarter_ is a whit better than\r\nthe one from Africa. One thing is certain--that its results are more\r\nmenacing to the tranquillity of the people in this quarter, as there\r\ncan be no comparison between the ability and inclination to do\r\nmischief, possessed by the Virginia negro, and that of the rude and\r\nignorant African.\"\r\n\r\nThat the New Orleans Editor does not exaggerate in saying that the\r\ninternal slave-trade puts 'millions' into the pockets of the\r\nslaveholders in Maryland and Virginia, is very clear from the\r\nfollowing statement, made by the editor of the Virginia Times, an\r\ninfluential political paper, published at Wheeling, Virginia. Of the\r\nexact date of the paper we are not quite certain, it was, however,\r\nsometime in 1836, probably near the middle of the year--the file will\r\nshow. The editor says:--\r\n\r\n\"We have heard intelligent men estimate the number of slaves exported\r\nfrom Virginia within the last twelve months, at 120,000--each slave\r\naveraging at least $600, making an aggregate at $72,000,000. Of the\r\nnumber of slaves exported, not more than _one-third_ have been sold,\r\n(the others having been carried by their owners, who have removed,)\r\n_which would leave in the state the_ SUM OF $24,000,000 ARISING FROM\r\nTHE SALE OF SLAVES.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to this estimate about FORTY THOUSAND SLAVES WERE SOLD OUT\r\nOF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA IN A SINGLE YEAR, and the 'slave-breeders'\r\nwho hold them, put into their pockets TWENTY-FOUR MILLION OF DOLLARS,\r\nthe price of the 'souls of men.'\r\n\r\nThe New York Journal of Commerce of Oct. 12, 1835, contained a letter\r\nfrom a Virginian, whom the editor calls 'a very good and sensible\r\nman,' asserting that TWENTY THOUSAND SLAVES had been driven to the\r\nsouth from Virginia _during that year_, nearly one-fourth of which was\r\nthen remaining.\r\n\r\nThe Maryville (Tenn.) Intelligencer, some time in the early part of\r\n1836, (we have not the date,) says, in an article reviewing a\r\ncommunication of Rev. J.W. Douglass, of Fayetteville, North Carolina:\r\n\"Sixty thousand slaves passed through a little western town for the\r\nsouthern market, during the year 1835.\"\r\n\r\nThe Natchez (Miss.) Courier, says \"that the states of Louisiana,\r\nMississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas, imported TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY\r\nTHOUSAND SLAVES from the more northern slave states in the year 1836.\"\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore American gives the following from a Mississippi paper,\r\nof 1837:\r\n\r\n\"The report made by the committee of the citizens Of Mobile, appointed\r\nat their meeting held on the 1st instant, on the subject of the\r\nexisting pecuniary pressure, states, among other things: that so large\r\nhas been the return of slave labor, that purchases by Alabama of that\r\nspecies of property from other states since 1833, have amounted to\r\nabout TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.\"\r\n\r\nFURTHER the _inhumanity_ of a slaveholding 'public opinion' toward\r\nslaves, follows legitimately from the downright ruffianism of the\r\nslaveholding _spirit_ in the 'highest class of society,' When roused,\r\nit tramples upon all the proprieties and courtesies, and even common\r\ndecencies of life, and is held in check by none of those\r\nconsiderations of time, and place, and relations of station,\r\ncharacter, law, and national honor, which are usually sufficient, even\r\nin the absence of conscientious principles, to restrain other men from\r\noutrages. Our National Legislature is a fit illustration of this.\r\nSlaveholders have converted the Congress of the United States into a\r\nvery bear garden. Within the last three years some of the most\r\nprominent slaveholding members of the House, and among them the late\r\nspeaker, have struck and kicked, and throttled, and seized each other\r\nby the hair, and with their fists pummelled each other's faces, on the\r\nfloor of Congress. We need not publish an account of what every body\r\nknows, that during the session of the last Congress, Mr. Wise of\r\nVirginia and Mr. Bynum of North Carolina, after having called each\r\nother \"liars, villains\" and \"damned rascals\" sprung from their seats\r\n\"both sufficiently armed for any desperate purpose,\" cursing each\r\nother as they rushed together, and would doubtless have butchered each\r\nother on the floor of Congress, if both had not been seized and held\r\nby their friends.\r\n\r\nThe New York Gazette relates the following which occurred at the close\r\nof the session of 1838.\r\n\r\n\"The House could not adjourn without another brutal and bloody row. It\r\noccurred on Sunday morning immediately at the moment of adjournment,\r\nbetween Messrs. Campbell and Maury, both of Tennessee. He took offence\r\nat some remarks made to him by his colleague, Mr. Campbell, and the\r\nfight followed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Huntsville (Ala.) Democrat of June 16, 1838, gives the particulars\r\nwhich follow:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Maury is said to be badly hurt. He was near losing his life by\r\nbeing knocked through the window; but his adversary, it is said, saved\r\nhim by clutching the hair of his head with his left hand, while he\r\nstruck him with his right.\"\r\n\r\nThe same number of the Huntsville Democrat, contains the particulars\r\nof a fist-fight on the floor of the House of Representatives, between\r\nMr. Bell, the late Speaker, and his colleague Mr. Turney of Tennessee.\r\nThe following is an extract:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Turney concluded his remarks in reply to Mr. Bell, in the course\r\nof which he commented upon that gentleman's course at different\r\nperiods of his political career with great severity.\r\n\r\n\"He did not think his colleague [Mr. Turney,] was actuated by private\r\nmalice, but was the willing voluntary instrument of others, the tool\r\nof tools.\r\n\r\nMr. Turney. It is false! it is false!\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley called Mr. TURNEY to order.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment both gentlemen were perceived in personal conflict,\r\nand blows with the fist were aimed by each at the other. Several\r\nmembers interfered, and suppressed the personal violence; others\r\ncalled order, order, and some called for the interference of the\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker hastily took the chair, and insisted upon order; but both\r\ngentlemen continued struggling, and endeavoring, notwithstanding the\r\nconstraint of their friends, to strike each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the New York Gazette gives the following, which\r\ntook place about the time of the preceding affrays:\r\n\r\n\"The House was much agitated last night, by the passage between Mr.\r\nBiddle, of Pittsburgh, and Mr. Downing, of Florida. Mr. D. exclaimed\r\n\"do you impute falsehood to me!\" at the same time catching up some\r\nmissile and making a demonstration to advance upon Mr. Biddle. Mr.\r\nBiddle repeated his accusation, and meanwhile, Mr. Downing was\r\narrested by many members.\"\r\n\r\nThe last three fights all occurred, if we mistake not, in the short\r\nspace of one month. The fisticuffs between Messrs. Bynum and Wise\r\noccurred at the previous session of Congress. At the same session\r\nMessrs. Peyton of Tenn. and Wise of Virginia, went armed with pistols\r\nand dirks to the meeting of a committee of Congress, and threatened to\r\nshoot a witness while giving his testimony.\r\n\r\nWe begin with the first on the list. Who are Messrs. Wise and Bynum?\r\nBoth slaveholders. Who are Messrs. Campbell and Maury? Both\r\nslaveholders. Who are Messrs. Bell and Turney? Both slaveholders. Who\r\nis Mr. Downing, who seized a weapon and rushed upon Mr. Biddle? A\r\nslaveholder. Who is Mr. Peyton who drew his pistol on a witness before\r\na committee of Congress? A slaveholder of course. All these bullies\r\nwere slaveholders, and they magnified their office, and slaveholding\r\nwas justified of her children. We might fill a volume with similar\r\nchronicles of slaveholding brutality. But time would fail us. Suffice\r\nit to say, that since the organization of the government, a majority\r\nof the most distinguished men in the slaveholding states have gloried\r\nin strutting over the stage in the character of murderers. Look at the\r\nmen whom the people delight to honor. President Jackson, Senator\r\nBenton, the late Gen. Coffee,--it is but a few years since these\r\nslaveholders shot at, and stabbed, and stamped upon each other in a\r\ntavern broil. General Jackson had previously killed Mr. Dickenson.\r\nSenator Clay of Kentucky has immortalized himself by shooting at a\r\nnear relative of Chief Justice Marshall, and being wounded by him; and\r\nnot long after by shooting at John Randolph of Virginia. Governor\r\nM'Duffie of South Carolina has signalized himself also, both by\r\nshooting and being shot,--so has Governor Poindexter, and Governor\r\nRowan, and Judge M'Kinley of the U.S. Supreme Court, late senator in\r\nCongress from Alabama,--but we desist; a full catalogue would fill\r\npages. We will only add, that a few months since, in the city of\r\nLondon, Governor Hamilton, of South Carolina, went armed with pistols,\r\nto the lodgings of Daniel O'Connell, 'to stop his wind' in the\r\nbullying slang of his own published boast. During the last session of\r\nCongress Messrs. Dromgoole and Wise[41] of Virginia, W. Cost Johnson\r\nand Jenifer of Maryland, Pickens and Campbell of South Carolina, and\r\nwe know not how many more slaveholding members of Congress have been\r\nengaged, either as principals or seconds, in that species of murder\r\ndignified with the name of duelling. But enough; we are heart-sick.\r\nWhat meaneth all this? Are slaveholders worse than other men? No! but\r\narbitrary power has wrought in them its mystery of iniquity, and\r\npoisoned their better nature with its infuriating sorcery.\r\n\r\nTheir savage ferocity toward each other when their passions are up, is\r\nthe natural result of their habit of daily plundering and oppressing\r\nthe slave.\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Standard of August 30, 1837, contains the following\r\nillustration of this ferocity exhibited by two southern lawyers in\r\nsettling the preliminaries of a duel.\r\n\r\n\"The following conditions were proposed by Alexander K. McClung, of\r\nRaymond, in the State of Mississippi, to H.C. Stewart, as the laws to\r\ngovern a duel they were to fight near Vicksburg:\r\n\r\n\"Article 1st. The parties shall meet opposite Vicksburg, in the State\r\nof Louisiana, on Thursday the 29th inst. precisely at 4 o'clock, P.M.\r\nAgreed to.\r\n\r\n\"2d. The weapons to be used by each shall weigh one pound two and a\r\nhalf ounces, measuring sixteen inches and a half in length, including\r\nthe handle, and one inch and three-eighths in breadth. Agreed to.\r\n\r\n\"3d. Both knives shall be sharp on one edge, and on the back shall be\r\nsharp only one inch at the point. Agreed to.\r\n\r\n\"4th. Each party shall stand at the distance of eight feet from the\r\nother, until the word is given. Agreed to.\r\n\r\n\"5th. The second of each party shall throw up, with a silver dollar, on\r\nthe ground, for the word, and two best out of three shall win the\r\nword. Agreed to.\r\n\r\n\"6th. After the word is given, either party may take what advantage he\r\ncan with his knife, but on throwing his knife at the other, shall be\r\nshot down by the second of his opponent. Agreed to.\r\n\r\n\"7th. Each party shall be stripped entirely naked, except one pair of\r\nlinen pantaloons; one pair of socks, and boots or pumps as the party\r\nplease. Acceded to.\r\n\r\n\"8th. The wrist of the left arm of each party shall be tied tight to\r\nhis left thigh, and a strong cord shall be fastened around his left\r\narm at the elbow, and then around his body. Rejected.\r\n\r\n\"9th. After the word is given, each party shall be allowed to advance\r\nor recede as he pleases, over the space of twenty acres of ground,\r\nuntil death ensues to one of the parties. Agreed to--the parties to be\r\nplaced in the centre of the space.\r\n\r\n\"10th. The word shall be given by the winner of the same, in the\r\nfollowing manner, viz: \"Gentlemen are you ready?\" Each party shall\r\nthen answer, \"I am!\" The second giving the word shall then distinctly\r\ncommand--_strike_. Agreed to.\r\n\r\n\"If either party shall violate these rules, upon being notified by the\r\nsecond of either party, he may be liable to be shot down instantly. As\r\nestablished usage points out the duty of both parties, therefore\r\nnotification is considered unnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe FAVORITE AMUSEMENTS of slaveholders, like the gladiatorial shows\r\nof Rome and the Bull Fights of Spain, reveal a public feeling\r\ninsensible to suffering, and a depth of brutality in the highest\r\ndegree revolting to every truly noble mind. One of their most common\r\namusements is cock fighting. Mains of cocks, with twenty, thirty, and\r\nfifty cocks on each side, are fought for hundreds of dollars aside.\r\nThe fowls are armed with steel spurs or '_gafts_,' about two inches\r\nlong. These 'gafts' are fastened upon the legs by sawing off the\r\n_natural_ 'spur,' leaving only enough of it to answer the purpose of a\r\n_stock_ for the tube of the \"gafts,\" which are so sharp that at a\r\nstroke the fowls thrust them through each other's necks and heads, and\r\ntear each other's bodies till one or both dies, then two others are\r\nbrought forward for the amusement of the multitude assembled, and this\r\nbarbarous pastime is often kept up for days in succession, hundreds\r\nand thousands gathering from a distance to witness it. The following\r\nadvertisements from the Raleigh Register, June 18, 1838, edited by\r\nMessrs. Gales and Son, the father and brother of Mr. Gales, editor of\r\nthe National Intelligencer, and late Mayor of Washington City, reveal\r\nthe public sentiment of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"CHATHAM AGAINST NASH, or any other county in the State. I am\r\nauthorized to take a bet of any amount that may be offered, to FIGHT A\r\nMAIN OF COCKS, at any place that may be agreed upon by the parties--to\r\nbe fought the ensuing spring. GIDEON ALSTON. Chatham county, June 7,\r\n1838.\"\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after, this challenge was answered as follows:\r\n\r\n\"TO MR. GIDEON ALSTON, of Chatham county, N.C.\r\n\r\n\"SIR: In looking over the North Carolina Standard of the 20th inst. I\r\ndiscover a challenge over your signature, headed 'Chatham against\r\nNash,' in which you state: that you are 'authorized to take a bet of\r\nany amount that may be offered, to fight a main of cocks, at any place\r\nthat may be agreed upon by the parties, to be fought the ensuing\r\nspring' which challenge I ACCEPT: and do propose to meet you at\r\nRolesville, in Wake county, N.C. on the last Wednesday in May next,\r\nthe parties to show thirty-one cocks each--fight four days, and be\r\ngoverned by the rules as laid down in Turner's Cock Laws--which, if\r\nyou think proper to accede to, you will signify through this or any\r\nother medium you may select, and then I will name the sum for which we\r\nshall fight, as that privilege was surrendered by you in your\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n\"I am, sir, very respectfully, &c. NICHOLAS W. ARRINGTON, near\r\nHilliardston, Nash co. North Carolina June 22nd, 1838\"\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement in the Richmond Whig, of July 12, 1837,\r\nexhibits the public sentiment of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"MAIN OF COCKS.--A large 'MAIN OF COCKS,' 21 a side, for $25 'the\r\nfight', and $500 'the odd,' will be fought between the County of\r\nDinwiddie on one part, and the Counties of Hanover and Henrico on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\"The 'regular' fighting will be continued _three days_, and from the\r\nlarge number of 'game uns' on both sides and in the adjacent country,\r\nwill be prolonged no doubt a _fourth_. To prevent confusion and\r\npromote 'sport,' the Pit will be enclosed and furnished with _seats_;\r\nso that those having a curiosity to witness a species of diversion\r\noriginating in a better day (for they had no rag money then,) can have\r\n_that_ very _natural_ feeling gratified.\r\n\r\n\"The Petersburg Constellation is requested to copy.\"\r\n\r\n_Horse-racing_ too, as every body knows, is a favorite amusement of\r\nslaveholders. Every slave state has its race course, and in the older\r\nstates almost every county has one on a small scale. There is hardly a\r\nday in the year, the weather permitting, in which crowds do not\r\nassemble at the south to witness this barbarous sport. Horrible\r\ncruelty is absolutely inseparable from it. Hardly a race occurs of any\r\ncelebrity in which some one of the coursers is not lamed, 'broken\r\ndown,' or in some way seriously injured, often for life, and not\r\nunfrequently they are killed by the rupture of some vital part in the\r\nstruggle. When the heats are closely contested, the blood of the\r\ntortured animal drips from the lash and flies at every leap from the\r\nstroke of the rowel. From the breaking of girths and other accidents,\r\ntheir riders (mostly slaves) are often thrown and maimed or killed.\r\nYet these amusements are attended by thousands in every part of the\r\nslave states. The wealth and fashion, the gentlemen and _ladies_ of\r\nthe 'highest circles' at the south, throng the race course.\r\n\r\nThat those who can fasten steel spurs upon the legs of dunghill fowls,\r\nand goad the poor birds to worry and tear each other to death--and\r\nthose who can crowd by thousands to _witness_ such barbarity--that\r\nthose who can throng the race-course and with keen relish witness the\r\nhot pantings of the life-struggle, the lacerations and fitful spasms\r\nof the muscles, swelling through the crimsoned foam, as the tortured\r\nsteeds rush in blood-welterings to the goal--that such, should look\r\nupon the sufferings of their slaves with, indifference is certainly\r\nsmall wonder.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we shall be told that there are thronged race-courses at the\r\nNorth. True, there are a few, and they are thronged chiefly by\r\n_Southerners_, and 'Northern men with _Southern_ principles,' and\r\nsupported mainly by the patronage of slaveholders who summer at the\r\nNorth. Cock-fighting and horse-racing are \"_Southern_ institutions.\"\r\nThe idleness, contempt of labor, dissipation, sensuality, brutality,\r\ncruelty, and meanness, engendered by the habit of making men and women\r\nwork without pay, and flogging them if they demur at it, constitutes a\r\ncongenial soil out of which cock-fighting and horse-racing are the\r\nspontaneous growth.\r\n\r\nAgain,--The kind treatment of the slaves is often argued from the\r\nliberal education and enlarged views of slaveholders. The facts and\r\nreasonings of the preceding pages have shown, that 'liberal\r\neducation,' despotic habits and ungoverned passions work together with\r\nslight friction. And every day's observation shows that the former is\r\noften a stimulant to the latter.\r\n\r\nBut the notion so common at the north that the majority of the\r\nslaveholders are persons of education, is entirely erroneous. A _very\r\nfew_ slaveholders in each of the slave states have been men of _ripe_\r\neducation, to whom our national literature is much indebted. A larger\r\nnumber may be called _well_ educated--these reside mostly in the\r\ncities and large villages, but a majority of the slaveholders are\r\nignorant men, thousands of them notoriously so, _mere boors_ unable to\r\nwrite their names or to read the alphabet.\r\n\r\nNo one of the slave states has probably so much general education as\r\nVirginia. It is the oldest of them--has furnished one half of the\r\npresidents of the United States--has expended more upon her university\r\nthan any state in the Union has done during the same time upon its\r\ncolleges--sent to Europe nearly twenty years since for her most\r\nlearned professors, and in fine, has far surpassed every other slave\r\nstate in her efforts to disseminate education among her citizens, and\r\nyet, the Governor of Virginia in his message to the legislature (Jan.\r\n7, 1839) says, that of four thousand six hundred and fourteen adult\r\nmales in that state, who applied to the county clerks for marriage\r\nlicenses in the year 1837, 'ONE THOUSAND AND FORTY SEVEN _were unable\r\nto write their names_.' The governor adds, 'These statements, it will\r\nbe remembered, are confined to one sex: the education of females it is\r\nto be feared, is in a condition of _much greater neglect_.'\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the Virginia Times, published at Wheeling, in his paper\r\nof Jan. 23, 1839, says,--\r\n\r\n\"We have every reason to suppose that one-fourth of the people of the\r\nstate cannot write their names, and they have not, of course, any\r\nother species of education.\"\r\n\r\nKentucky is the child of Virginia; her first settlers were some of the\r\nmost distinguished citizens of the mother state; in the general\r\ndiffusion of intelligence amongst her citizens Kentucky is probably in\r\nadvance of all the slave states except Virginia and South Carolina;\r\nand yet Governor Clark, in his last message to the Kentucky\r\nLegislature, (Dec 5, 1838) makes the following declaration: \"From the\r\ncomputation of those most familiar with the subject, it appears that\r\nAT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE ADULT POPULATION OF THE STATE ARE UNABLE TO\r\nWRITE THEIR NAMES.\"\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement in the \"Milledgeville (Geo.) Journal,\"\r\nDec. 26, 1837, is another specimen from one of the 'old thirteen.'\r\n\r\n\"NOTICE.--I, Pleasant Webb, of the State of Georgia, Oglethorpe\r\ncounty, being an _illiterate man, and not able to write my own name_,\r\nand whereas it hath been represented to me that there is a certain\r\npromissory note or notes out against me that I know nothing of, and\r\nfurther that some man in this State holds a bill of sale for _a\r\ncertain negro woman named Ailsey and her increase, a part of which is\r\nnow in my possession_, which I also know nothing of. Now do hereby\r\ncertify and declare, that I have no knowledge whatsoever of any such\r\npapers existing in my name as above stated and I hereby require all or\r\nany person or persons whatsoever holding or pretending to hold any\r\nsuch papers, to produce them to me within thirty days from the date\r\nhereof, shewing their authority for holding the same, or they will be\r\nconsidered fictitious and fraudulently obtained or raised, by some\r\nperson or persons for base purposes after my death.\r\n\r\n\"Given under my hand this 2nd day of December, 1837. PLEASANT WEBB.\r\nhis mark X.\"\r\n\r\nFINALLY, THAT SLAVES MUST HABITUALLY SUFFER GREAT CRUELTIES, FOLLOWS\r\nINEVITABLY FROM THE BRUTAL OUTRAGES WHICH THEIR MASTERS INFLICT ON\r\nEACH OTHER.\r\n\r\nSlaveholders, exercising from childhood irresponsible power over human\r\nbeings, and in the language of President Jefferson, \"giving loose to\r\nthe worst of passions\" in the treatment of their slaves, become in a\r\ngreat measure unfitted for self control in their intercourse with each\r\nother. Tempers accustomed to riot with loose reins, spurn restraints,\r\nand passions inflamed by indulgence, take fire on the least friction.\r\nWe repeat it, the state of society in the slave states, the duels, and\r\ndaily deadly affrays of slaveholders with each other--the fact that\r\nthe most deliberate and cold-blooded murders are committed at noon\r\nday, in the presence of thousands, and the perpetrators eulogized by\r\nthe community as \"honorable men,\" reveals such a prostration of law,\r\nas gives impunity to crime--a state of society, an omnipresent public\r\nsentiment reckless of human life, taking bloody vengeance on the spot\r\nfor every imaginary affront, glorying in such assassinations as the\r\nonly true honor and chivalry, successfully defying the civil arm, and\r\nlaughing its impotency to scorn.\r\n\r\nWhen such things are done in the green tree, what will be done in the\r\ndry? When slaveholders are in the habit of caning, stabbing, and\r\nshooting _each other_ at every supposed insult, the unspeakable\r\nenormities perpetrated by such men, with such passions, upon their\r\ndefenceless slaves, _must_ be beyond computation. To furnish the\r\nreader with an illustration of slaveholding civilization and morality,\r\nas exhibited in the unbridled fury, rage, malignant hate, jealousy,\r\ndiabolical revenge, and all those infernal passions that shoot up rank\r\nin the hot-bed of arbitrary power, we will insert here a mass of\r\ntestimony, detailing a large number of affrays, lynchings,\r\nassassinations, &c., &c., which have taken place in various parts of\r\nthe slave states within a brief period--and to leave no room for cavil\r\non the subject, these extracts will be made exclusively from\r\nnewspapers published in the slave states, and generally in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the tragedies described. They will not be made\r\nsecond hand from _northern_ papers, but from the original _southern_\r\npapers, which now lie on our table.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to furnish details of certain classes of crimes in\r\nthe slave states, we advertise the reader--1st. That _we shall not_\r\ninclude in the list those crimes which are ordinarily committed in the\r\nfree, as well as in the slave states. 2d. We shall not include any of\r\nthe crimes perpetrated by whites upon slaves and free colored persons,\r\nwho constitute a majority of the population in Mississippi and\r\nLouisiana, a large majority in South Carolina, and, on an average,\r\ntwo-fifths in the other slave states. 3d. Fist fights, canings,\r\nbeatings, biting off noses and ears, gougings, knockings down, &c.,\r\nunless they result in _death_, will not be included in the list, nor\r\nwill _ordinary_ murders, unless connected with circumstances that\r\nserve as a special index of public sentiment. 4th. Neither will\r\n_ordinary, formal duels_ be included, except in such cases as just\r\nspecified. 5th. The only crimes which, as the general rule, will be\r\nspecified, will be deadly affrays with bowie knives, dirks, pistols.\r\nrifles, guns, or other death weapons, and _lynchings_. 6th. The crimes\r\nenumerated will, for the most part, be only those perpetrated\r\n_openly_, without _attempt at concealment_. 7th. We shall not attempt\r\nto give a full list of the affrays, &c., that took place in the\r\nrespective states during the period selected, as the only files of\r\nsouthern papers to which we have access are very imperfect.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perceive, from these preliminaries, that only a\r\n_small_ proportion of the crimes actually perpetrated in the\r\nrespective slave states during the period selected, will be entered\r\nupon this list. He will also perceive, that the crimes which will be\r\npresented are of a class rarely perpetrated in the free states; and if\r\nperpetrated there at all, they are, with scarcely an exception,\r\ncommitted either by slaveholders, temporarily resident in them, or by\r\npersons whose passions have been inflamed by the poison of a southern\r\ncontact--whose habits and characters have become perverted by living\r\namong slaveholders, and adopting the code of slaveholding morality.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the details, commencing with the new state of\r\nArkansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARKANSAS.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of the legislature of that state, Col. John\r\nWilson, President of the Bank at Little Rock, the capital of the\r\nstate, was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. He had\r\nbeen elected to that office for a number of years successively, and\r\nwas one of the most influential citizens of the state. While presiding\r\nover the deliberations of the House, he took umbrage at words spoken\r\nin debate by Major Anthony, a conspicuous member, came down from the\r\nSpeaker's chair, drew a large bowie knife from his bosom, and attacked\r\nMajor A., who defended himself for some time, but was at last stabbed\r\nthrough the heart, and fell dead on the floor. Wilson deliberately\r\nwiped the blood from his knife, and returned to his seat. The\r\nfollowing statement of the circumstances of the murder, and the trial\r\nof the murderer, is abridged from the account published in the\r\nArkansas Gazette, a few months since--it is here taken from the\r\nKnoxville (Tennessee) Register, July 4, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"On the 14th of December last, Maj. Joseph J. Anthony, a member of the\r\nLegislature of Arkansas, was murdered, while performing his duty as a\r\nmember of the House of Representatives, by John Wilson, Speaker of\r\nthat House.\r\n\r\n\"The facts were these: A bill came from the Senate, commonly called the\r\n_Wolf Bill_. Among the amendments proposed, was one by Maj. Anthony,\r\nthat the signature of the President of the Real Estate Bank should be\r\nattached to the certificate of the wolf scalp. Col. Wilson, the\r\nSpeaker, asked Maj. Anthony whether he intended the remark as\r\npersonal. Maj. Anthony promptly said, \"_No, I do not_.\" And at that\r\ninstant of time, a message was delivered from the Senate, which\r\nsuspended the proceedings of the House for a few minutes. Immediately\r\nafter the messenger from the Senate had retired, Maj. Anthony rose\r\nfrom his seat, and said he wished to explain, that he did not intend\r\nto insult the Speaker or the House; when Wilson, interrupting,\r\nperemptorily ordered him to take his seat. Maj. Anthony said, as a\r\nmember, he had a right to the floor, to explain himself. Wilson said,\r\nin an angry tone, 'Sit down, or you had better;' and thrust his hand\r\ninto his bosom, and drew out a large bowie knife, 10 or 11 inches in\r\nlength, and descended from the Speaker's chair to the floor, with the\r\nknife drawn in a menacing manner. Maj. Anthony, seeing the danger he\r\nwas placed in, by Wilson's advance on him with a drawn knife, rose\r\nfrom his chair, set it out of his way, stepped back a pace or two, and\r\ndrew his knife. Wilson caught up a chair, and struck Anthony with it.\r\nAnthony, recovering from the blow, caught the chair in his left hand,\r\nand a fight ensued over the chair. Wilson received two wounds, one on\r\neach arm, and Anthony lost his knife, either by throwing it at Wilson,\r\nor it escaped by accident. After Anthony had lost his knife, Wilson\r\nadvanced on Anthony, who was then retreating, looking over his\r\nshoulder. Seeing Wilson pursuing him, he threw a chair. Wilson still\r\npursued, and Anthony raised another chair as high as his breast, with\r\na view, it is supposed, of keeping Wilson off. Wilson then caught hold\r\nof the chair with his left hand, raised it up, and with his right hand\r\ndeliberately thrust the knife, up to the hilt, into Anthony's heart,\r\nand as deliberately drew it out, and wiping off the blood with his\r\nthumb and finger, retired near to the Speaker's chair.\r\n\r\n\"As the knife was withdrawn from Anthony's heart, he fell a lifeless\r\ncorpse on the floor, without uttering a word, or scarcely making a\r\nstruggle; so true did the knife, as deliberately directed, pierce his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Three days elapsed before the constituted authorities took any notice\r\nof this horrible deed; and not then, until a relation of the murdered\r\nAnthony had demanded a warrant for the apprehension of Wilson. Several\r\ndays then elapsed before he was brought before an examining court. He\r\nthen, in a carriage and four, came to the place appointed for his\r\ntrial. Four or five days were employed in the examination of\r\nwitnesses, and never was a clearer case of murder proved than on that\r\noccasion. Notwithstanding, the court (Justice Brown dissenting)\r\nadmitted Wilson to bail, and positively refused that the prosecuting\r\nattorney for the state should introduce the law, to show that it was\r\nnot a bailable case, or even to hear an argument from him.\r\n\r\n\"At the time appointed for the session of the Circuit Court, Wilson\r\nappeared agreeably to his recognizance. A motion was made by Wilson's\r\ncounsel for _change of venue_, founded on the affidavits of Wilson,\r\nand two other men. The court thereupon removed the case to Saline\r\ncounty, and ordered the Sheriff to take Wilson into custody, and\r\ndeliver him over to the Sheriff of Saline county.\r\n\r\n\"The Sheriff of Pulaski never confined Wilson one minute, but\r\npermitted him to go where he pleased, without a guard, or any\r\nrestraint imposed on him whatever. On his way to Saline, he\r\nentertained him freely at his own house, and the next day delivered\r\nhim over to the Sheriff of that county, who conducted the prisoner to\r\nthe debtor's room in the jail, and gave him the key, so that he and\r\nevery body else had free egress and ingress at all times. Wilson\r\ninvited every body to call on him, as he wished to see his friends,\r\nand his room was crowded with visitors, who called to drink grog, and\r\nlaugh and talk with him. But this theatre was not sufficiently large\r\nfor his purpose. He afterwards visited the dram-shops, where he freely\r\ntreated all that would partake with him, and went fishing and hunting\r\nwith others at pleasure, and entirely with out restraint. He also ate\r\nat the same table with the Judge, while on trial.\r\n\r\n\"When the court met at Saline, Wilson was put on his trial. Several\r\ndays were occupied in examining the witnesses in the case. After the\r\nexamination was closed, while Col. Taylor was engaged in a very able,\r\nlucid, and argumentative speech, on the part of the prosecution, some\r\nman collected a parcel of the rabble, and came within a few yards of\r\nthe court-house door, and bawled in a loud voice, 'part them--part\r\nthem!' Every body supposed there was an affray, and ran to the doors\r\nand windows to see; behold, there was nothing more than the man, and\r\nthe rabble he had collected around him, for the purpose of annoying\r\nCol. Taylor while speaking. A few minutes afterwards, this same person\r\nbrought a horse near the court-house door, and commenced crying the\r\nhorse, as though he was for sale, and continued for ten or fifteen\r\nminutes to ride before the court-house door, crying the horse, in a\r\nloud and boisterous tone of voice. The Judge sat as a silent listener\r\nto the indignity thus offered the court and counsel by this man,\r\nwithout interposing his authority.\r\n\r\n\"To show the depravity of the times, and the people, after the verdict\r\nhad been delivered by the jury, and the court informed Wilson that he\r\nwas discharged, there was a rush toward him: some seized him by the\r\nhand, some by the arm, and there was great and loud rejoicing and\r\nexultation, directly in the presence of the court: and Wilson told the\r\nSheriff to take the jury to a grocery, that he might treat them, and\r\ninvited every body that chose to go. The house was soon filled to\r\noverflowing. The rejoicing was kept up till near supper time: but to\r\ncap the climax, soon after supper was over, a majority of the jury,\r\ntogether with many others, went to the rooms that had been occupied\r\nseveral days by the friend and relation of the murdered Anthony, and\r\ncommenced a scene of the most ridiculous dancing, (as it is believed,)\r\nin triumph for Wilson, and as a triumph over the feelings of the\r\nrelations of the departed Anthony. The scene did not close here. The\r\nparty retired to a dram-shop, and continued their rejoicing until\r\nabout half after 10 o'clock. They then collected a parcel of horns,\r\ntrumpets, &c., and marched through the streets, blowing them, till\r\nnear day, when one of the company rode his horse in the porch\r\nadjoining the room which was occupied by the relations of the\r\ndeceased.\"\r\n\r\nThis case is given to the reader at length, in order fully to show,\r\nthat in a community where the law sanctions the commission of every\r\nspecies of outrage upon one class of citizens, it fosters passions\r\nwhich will paralyze its power to protect the other classes. Look at\r\nthe facts developed in this case, as exhibiting the state of society\r\namong slaveholders. 1st. That the members of the legislature are _in\r\nthe habit_ of wearing bowie knives. Wilson's knife was 10 or 11 inches\r\nlong.[42] 2d. The murderer, Wilson, was a man of wealth, president of\r\nthe bank at the capital of the state, a high military officer, and\r\nhad, for many years, been Speaker of the House of Representatives, as\r\nappears from a previous statement in the Arkansas Gazette. 3d. The\r\nmurder was committed in open day, before all the members of the House,\r\nand many spectators, not one of whom seems to have made the least\r\nattempt to intercept Wilson, as he advanced upon Anthony with his\r\nknife drawn, but \"made way for him,\" as is stated in another account.\r\n4th. Though the murder was committed in the state-house, at the\r\ncapital of the state, days passed before the civil authorities moved\r\nin the matter; and they did not finally do it, until the relations of\r\nthe murdered man demanded a warrant for the apprehension of the\r\nmurderer. Even then, several days elapsed before he was brought before\r\nan examining court. When his trial came on, he drove to it in state,\r\ndrew up before the door with \"his coach and four,\" alighted, and\r\nstrided into court like a lord among his vassals; and there, though a\r\nclearer case of deliberate murder never reeked in the face of the sun,\r\nyet he was admitted to bail, the court absolutely refusing to hear an\r\nargument from the prosecuting attorney, showing that it was not a\r\nbailable case. 5th. The sheriff of Pulaski county, who had Wilson in\r\ncustody, \"never confined him a moment, but permitted him to go at\r\nlarge wholly unrestrained.\" When transferred to Saline co. for trial,\r\nthe sheriff of that county gave Wilson the same liberty, and he spent\r\nhis time in parties of pleasure, fishing, hunting, and at houses of\r\nentertainment. 6th. Finally, to demonstrate to the world, that justice\r\namong slaveholders is consistent with itself; that authorizing\r\nman-stealing and patronising robbery, it will, of course, be the\r\npatron and associate of murder also, the judge who sat upon the case,\r\nand the murderer who was on trial for his life before him, were\r\nboon-companions together, eating and drinking at the same table\r\nthroughout the trial. Then came the conclusion of the farce--the\r\nuproar round the court-house during the trial, drowning the voice of\r\nthe prosecutor while pleading, without the least attempt by the court\r\nto put it down--then the charge of the judge to the jury, and their\r\nunanimous verdict of acquittal--then the rush from all quarters around\r\nthe murderer with congratulations--the whole crowd in the court room\r\nshouting and cheering--then Wilson leading the way to a tavern,\r\ninviting the sheriff, and jury, and all present to \"a treat\"--then the\r\nbacchanalian revelry kept up all night, a majority of the jurors\r\nparticipating--the dancing, the triumphal procession through the\r\nstreets with the blowing of horns and trumpets, and the prancing of\r\nhorses through the porch of the house occupied by the relations of the\r\nmurdered Anthony, adding insult and mockery to their agony.\r\n\r\nA few months before this murder on the floor of the legislature,\r\nGeorge Scott, Esq., formerly marshall of the state was shot in an\r\naffray at Van Buren, Crawford co., Arkansas, by a man named Walker;\r\nand Robert Carothers, in an affray in St. Francis co., shot William\r\nRachel, just as Rachel was shooting at Carothers' father. (_National\r\nIntelligencer, May 8, 1837, and Little Rock Gazette, August 30,\r\n1837._)\r\n\r\nWhile Wilson's trial was in progress, Mr. Gabriel Sibley was stabbed\r\nto the heart at a public dinner, in St. Francis co., Arkansas, by\r\nJames W. Grant. (_Arkansas Gazette, May 30, 1838._)\r\n\r\nHardly a week before this, the following occurred:\r\n\r\n\"On the 16th ult., an encounter took place at Little Rock, Ark.,\r\nbetween David F. Douglass, a young man of 18 or 19, and Dr. Wm. C.\r\nHowell. A shot was exchanged between them at the distance of 8 or 10\r\nfeet with double-barrelled guns. The load of Douglass entered the left\r\nhip of Dr. Howell, and a buckshot from the gun of the latter struck a\r\nnegro girl, 13 or 14 years of age, just below the pit of the stomach.\r\nDouglass then fired a second time and hit Howell in the left groin,\r\npenetrating the abdomen and bladder, and causing his death in four\r\nhours. The negro girl, at the last dates, was not dead, but no hopes\r\nwere entertained of her recovery. Douglass was committed to await his\r\ntrial at the April term of the Circuit Court.\"--_Louisville Journal_.\r\n\r\nThe Little Rock Gazette of Oct. 24, says, \"We are again called upon\r\nto record the cold blooded murder of a valuable citizen. On the 10th\r\ninstant, Col. John Lasater, of Franklin co., was murdered by John W.\r\nWhitson, who deliberately shot him with a shot gun, loaded with a\r\nhandful of rifle balls, six of which entered his body. He lived twelve\r\nhours after he was shot.\r\n\r\n\"Whitson is the son of William Whitson, who was unfortunately killed,\r\nabout a year since, in a rencontre with Col. Lasater, (who was fully\r\nexonerated from all blame by a jury,) and, in revenge of his father's\r\ndeath, committed this bloody deed.\"\r\n\r\nThese atrocities were all perpetrated within a few months of the time\r\nof the deliberate assassination, on the floor of the legislature by\r\nthe speaker, already described, and are probably but a small portion\r\nof the outrages committed in that state during the same period. The\r\nstate of Arkansas contains about forty-five thousand white\r\ninhabitants, which is, if we mistake not, the present population of\r\nLitchfield county, Connecticut. And we venture the assertion, that a\r\npublic affray, with deadly weapons, has not taken place in that county\r\nfor fifty years, if indeed ever since its settlement a century and a\r\nhalf ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSOURI.\r\n\r\nMissouri became one of the United States in 1821. Its present white\r\npopulation is about two hundred and fifty thousand. The following are\r\na few of the affrays that have occurred there during the years 1837\r\nand '38.\r\n\r\nThe \"Salt River Journal\" March 8, 1838, has the following.\r\n\r\n\"_Fatal Affray_.--An affray took place during last week, in the town\r\nof New London, between Dr. Peake and Dr. Bosley, both of that village,\r\ngrowing out of some trivial matter at a card party. After some words,\r\nBosley threw a glass at Peake, which was followed up by other acts of\r\nviolence, and in the quarrel Peake stabbed Bosley, several times with\r\na dirk, in consequence of which, Bosley died the following morning.\r\nThe court of inquiry considered Peake justifiable, and discharged him\r\nfrom arrest.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the \"St. Louis Republican,\" of September 29, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"We learn that a fight occurred at Bowling-Green, in this state, a few\r\ndays since, between Dr. Michael Reynolds and Henry Lalor. Lalor\r\nprocured a gun, and Mr. Dickerson wrested the gun from him; this\r\nproduced a fight between Lalor and Dickerson, in which the former\r\nstabbed the latter in the abdomen. Mr. Dickerson died of the wound.\"\r\n\r\nThe following was in the same paper about a month previous, August 21,\r\n1837.\r\n\r\n\"_A Horse Thief Shot_.--A thief was caught in the act of stealing a\r\nhorse on Friday last, on the opposite side of the river, by a company\r\nof persons out sporting. Mr. Kremer, who was in the company, levelled\r\nhis rifle and ordered him to stop; which he refused; he then fired and\r\nlodged the contents in the thief's body, of which he died soon\r\nafterwards. Mr. K. went before a magistrate, who after hearing the\r\ncase, REFUSED TO HOLD HIM FOR FURTHER TRIAL!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July, 1838, Alpha P. Buckley murdered William Yaochum in\r\nan affray in Jackson county, Missouri. (Missouri Republican, July 24,\r\n1838.)\r\n\r\nGeneral Atkinson of the United States Army was waylaid on the 4th of\r\nSeptember, 1838, by a number of persons, and attacked in his carriage\r\nnear St. Louis, on the road to Jefferson Barracks, but escaped after\r\nshooting one of the assailants. The New Orleans True American of\r\nOctober 29, '38, speaking of this says: \"It will be recollected that a\r\nfew weeks ago, Judge Dougherty, one of the most respectable citizens\r\nof St. Louis, was murdered upon the same road.\"\r\n\r\nThe same paper contains the following letter from the murderer of\r\nJudge Dougherty.\r\n\r\n\"_Murder of Judge Dougherty_.--The St. Louis Republican received the\r\nfollowing mysterious letter, unsealed, regarding this brutal\r\nmurder:\"--\r\n\r\n\"NATCHEZ, Miss., Sept. 24.\r\n\r\n\"Messrs. Editors:--Revenge is sweet. On the night of the 11th, 12th,\r\nand 13th, I made preparations, and did, on the 14th July kill a\r\nrascal, and only regret that I have not the privilege of telling the\r\ncircumstance. I have so placed it that I can never be identified; and\r\nfurther, I have no compunctions of conscience for the death of Thomas\r\nM. Dougherty.\"\r\n\r\nBut instead of presenting individual affrays and single atrocities,\r\nhowever numerous, (and the Missouri papers abound with them,) in order\r\nto exhibit the true state of society there, we refer to the fact now\r\nuniversally notorious, that for months during the last fall and\r\nwinter, some hundreds of inoffensive Mormons, occupying a considerable\r\ntract of land; and a flourishing village in the interior of the state,\r\nhave suffered every species of inhuman outrage from the inhabitants of\r\nthe surrounding counties--that for weeks together, mobs consisting of\r\nhundreds and thousands, kept them in a state of constant siege, laying\r\nwaste their lands, destroying their cattle and provisions, tearing\r\ndown their houses, ravishing the females, seizing and dragging off and\r\nkilling the men. Not one of the thousands engaged in these horrible\r\noutrages and butcheries has, so far as we can learn, been indicted.\r\nThe following extract of a letter from a military officer of one of\r\nthe brigades ordered out by the Governor of Missouri, to terminate the\r\nmatter, is taken from the North Alabamian of December 22, 1838.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence of the Nashville Whig.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORMON WAR.\r\n\r\n\"MILLERSBURG, Mo. November 8.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir--A lawless mob had organized themselves for the express\r\npurpose of driving the Mormons from the country, or exterminating\r\nthem, for no other reason, that I can perceive, than that these poor\r\ndeluded creatures owned a large and fertile body of land in their\r\nneighborhood, and would not let them (the Mobocrats) have it for their\r\nown price. I have just returned from the seat of difficulty, and am\r\nperfectly conversant with all the facts in relation to it. The mob\r\nmeeting with resistance altogether unanticipated, called loudly upon\r\nthe kindred spirits of adjacent counties for help. The Mormons\r\ndetermined to die in defence of their rights, set about fortifying\r\ntheir town \"Far West,\" with a resolution and energy that kept the mob\r\n(who all the time were extending their cries of help to all parts of\r\nMissouri) at bay. The Governor, from exaggerated accounts of the\r\nMormon depredations, issued orders for the raising of several thousand\r\nmounted riflemen, of which this division raised five hundred, and the\r\nwriter of this was _honored_ with the appointment of ---- to the\r\nBrigade.\r\n\r\n\"On the first day of this month, we marched for the \"seat of war,\" but\r\nGeneral Clark, Commander-in-chief, having reached Far West on the day\r\nprevious with a large force, the difficulty was settled when we\r\narrived, so we escaped the infamy and disgrace of a bloody victory.\r\nBefore General Clark's arrival, the mob had increased to about four\r\nthousand, and determined to attack the town. The Mormons upon the\r\napproach of the mob, sent out a white flag, which being fired on by\r\nthe mob, Jo Smith and Rigdon, and a few other Mormons of less\r\ninfluence, gave themselves up to the mob, with a view of so far\r\nappeasing their wrath as to save their women and children from\r\nviolence. Vain hope! The prisoners being secured, the mob entered the\r\ntown and perpetrated every conceivable act of brutality and\r\noutrage--forcing fifteen or twenty Mormon girls to yield to their\r\nbrutal passions!!! Of these things I was assured by many persons while\r\nI was at Far West, in whose veracity I have the utmost confidence. I\r\nconversed with many of the prisoners, who numbered about eight\r\nhundred, among whom there were many young and interesting girls, and I\r\nassure you, a more distracted set of creatures I never saw. I assure\r\nyou, my dear sir, it was peculiarly heart-rending to see old gray\r\nheaded fathers and mothers, young ladies and innocent babes, forced at\r\nthis inclement season, with the thermometer at 8 degrees below zero,\r\nto abandon their warm houses, and many of them the luxuries and\r\nelegances of a high degree of civilization and intelligence and take\r\nup their march for the uncultivated wilds of the Missouri frontier.\r\n\r\n\"The better informed here have but one opinion of the result of this\r\nMormon persecution, and that is, it is a most fearful extension of\r\nJudge Lynch's jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nThe present white population of Missouri is but thirty thousand less\r\nthan that of New Hampshire, and yet the insecurity of human life in\r\nthe former state to that in the latter, is probably at least twenty to\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALABAMA.\r\n\r\nThis state was admitted to the Union in 1819. Its present white\r\npopulation is not far from three hundred thousand. The security of\r\nhuman life to Alabama, may be inferred from the facts and testimony\r\nwhich follow:\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Register of Nov. 15, 1837, contains the annual message of\r\nMr. McVay, the acting Governor of the state, at the opening of the\r\nLegislature. The message has the following on the frequency of\r\nhomicides:\r\n\r\n\"We hear of homicides in different parts of the state _continually_,\r\nand yet how few convictions for murder, and still fewer executions?\r\nHow is this to be accounted for? In regard to 'assault and battery\r\nwith intent to commit murder,' why is it that this offence continues\r\nso common--why do we hear of stabbings and shootings _almost daily_ in\r\nsome part or other of our state?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Montgomery (Alabama) Advertiser\" of April 22, 1837, has the\r\nfollowing from the Mobile Register:\r\n\r\n\"Within a few days a man was shot in an affray in the upper part of\r\nthe town, and has since died. The perpetrator of the violence is at\r\nlarge. We need hardly speak of another scene which occurred in Royal\r\nstreet, when a fray occurred between two individuals, a third standing\r\nby with a cocked pistol to prevent interference. On Saturday night a\r\nstill more exciting scene of outrage took place in the theatre.\r\n\r\n\"An altercation commenced at the porquett entrance between the\r\ncheck-taker and a young man, which ended in the first being\r\ndesperately wounded by a stab with a knife. The other also drew a\r\npistol. If some strange manifestations of public opinion, do not\r\ncoerce a spirit of deference to law, and the abandonment of the habit\r\nof carrying secret arms, we shall deserve every reproach we may\r\nreceive, and have our punishment in the unchecked growth of a spirit\r\nof lawlessness, reckless deeds, and exasperated feeling, which will\r\ndestroy our social comfort at home, and respectability abroad.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Huntsville Democrat,\" of Nov. 7, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"A trifling dispute arose between Silas Randal and Pharaoh Massingale,\r\nboth of Marshall county. They exchanged but a few words, when the\r\nformer drew a Bowie knife and stabbed the latter in the abdomen\r\nfronting the left hip to the depth of several inches; also inflicted\r\nseveral other dangerous wounds, of which Massengale died\r\nimmediately.--Randal is yet at large, not having been apprehended.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Free Press\" of August 16, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"The streets of Gainesville, Alabama, have recently been the scene of\r\na most tragic affair. Some five weeks since, at a meeting of the\r\ncitizens, Col. Christopher Scott, a lawyer of good standing, and one\r\nof the most influential citizens of the place, made a violent attack\r\non the Tombeckbee Rail Road Company. A Mr. Smith, agent for the T.R.R.\r\nCompany, took Col. C's remarks as a personal insult, and demanded an\r\nexplanation. A day or two after, as Mr. Smith was passing Colonel\r\nScott's door, he was shot down by him, and after lingering a few hours\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\n\"It appears also from an Alabama paper, that Col. Scott's brother,\r\nL.S. Scott Esq., and L.J. Smith Esq., were accomplices of the Colonel\r\nin the murder.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from the \"Natchez Free Trader,\" June 14, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"An affray, attended with fatal consequences, occurred in the town of\r\nMoulton, Alabama, on the 12th May. It appears that three young men\r\nfrom the country, of the name of J. Walton, Geo. Bowling, and\r\nAlexander Bowling, rode into Moulton on that day for the purpose of\r\nchastising the bar-keeper at McCord's tavern, whose name is Cowan, for\r\nan alleged insult offered by him to the father of young Walton. They\r\nmade a furious attack on Cowan, and drove him into the bar room of the\r\ntavern. Some time after, a second attack was made upon Cowan in the\r\nstreet by one of the Bowlings and Walton, when pistols were resorted\r\nto by both parties. Three rounds were fired, and the third shot, which\r\nwas said to have been discharged by Walton, struck a young man by the\r\nname of Neil, who happened to be passing in the street at the time,\r\nand killed him instantly. The combatants were taken into custody, and\r\nafter an examination before two magistrates, were bailed.\"\r\n\r\nThe following exploits of the \"Alabama Volunteers,\" are recorded in\r\nthe Florida Herald, Jan. 1, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"SAVE US FROM OUR FRIENDS.--On Monday last, a large body of men,\r\ncalling themselves Alabama Volunteers, arrived in the vicinity of this\r\ncity. It is reported that their conduct during their march from\r\nTallahassee to this city has been a series of excesses of every\r\ndescription. They have committed almost every crime except murder, and\r\nhave even threatened life.\r\n\r\n\"Large numbers of them paraded our streets, grossly insulted our\r\nfemales, and were otherwise extremely riotous in their conduct. One of\r\nthe squads, forty or fifty in number, on reaching the bridge, where\r\nthere was a small guard of three or four men stationed, assaulted the\r\nguard, overturned the sentry-box into the river, and bodily seized two\r\nof the guard, and threw them into the river, where the water was deep,\r\nand they were forced to swim for their lives. At one of the men while\r\nin the water, they pointed a musket, threatening to kill him; and\r\npelted with every missile which came to hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Alabama tragedy is published by the \"Columbia (S.C.)\r\nTelescope,\" Sept. **, 1837, from the Wetumpka Sentinel.\r\n\r\n\"Our highly respectable townsman, Mr. Hugh Ware, a merchant of\r\nWetumpka, was standing in the door of his counting room, between the\r\nhours of 8 and 9 o'clock at night, in company with a friend, when an\r\nassassin lurked within a few paces of his position, and discharged his\r\nmusket, loaded with ten or fifteen buckshot. Mr. Ware instantly fell,\r\nand expired without a struggle or a groan. A coroner's inquest decided\r\nthat the deceased came to his death by violence, and that Abner J.\r\nCody, and his servant John, were the perpetrators. John frankly\r\nconfessed, that his master, Cody, compelled him to assist, threatening\r\nhis life if he dared to disobey; that he carried the musket to the\r\nplace at which it was discharged; that his master then received it\r\nfrom him, rested it on the fence, fired and killed Mr. Ware.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Southern (Miss.) Mechanic,\" April 17, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"HORRID BUTCHERY.--A desperate fight occurred in Montgomery, Alabama,\r\non the 28th ult. We learn from the Advocate of that city, that the\r\npersons engaged were Wm. S. Mooney and Kenyon Mooney, his son, Edward\r\nBell, and Bushrod Bell, Jr. The first received a wound in the abdomen,\r\nmade by that fatal instrument, the Bowie knife, which caused his death\r\nin about fifteen hours. The second was shot in the side, and would\r\ndoubtless have been killed, had not the ball partly lost its force by\r\nfirst striking his arm. The third received a shot in the neck, and now\r\nlies without hope of recovery. The fourth escaped unhurt, and, we\r\nunderstand has fled. This is a brief statement of one of the bloodiest\r\nfights that we ever heard of.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Virginia Statesman,\" May 6, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"Several affrays, wherein pistols, dirks and knives were used, lately\r\noccurred at Mobile. One took place on the 8th inst., at the theatre,\r\nin which a Mr. Bellum was so badly stabbed that his life is despaired\r\nof. On the Wednesday preceding, a man named Johnson shot another named\r\nSnow dead. No notice was taken of the affair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Huntsville Advocate,\" June 20, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"DESPERATE AFFRAY.--On Sunday the 11th inst., an affray of desparate\r\nand fatal character occurred near Jeater's Landing, Marshall county,\r\nAlabama. The dispute which led to it arose out of a contested right to\r\n_possession_ of a piece of land. A Mr. Steele was the occupant, and\r\nMr. James McFarlane and some others, claimants. Mr. F. and his friends\r\nwent to Mr. Steele's house with a view to take possession, whether\r\npeaceably or by violence, we do not certainly know. As they entered\r\nthe house a quarrel ensued between the opposite parties, and some\r\nblows perhaps followed; in a short time, several guns were discharged\r\nfrom the house at Mr. McFarlane and friends. Mr. M. was killed, a Mr.\r\nFreamster dangerously wounded, and it is thought will not recover; two\r\nothers were also wounded, though not so as to endanger life. Mr.\r\nSteele's brother was wounded by the discharge of a pistol from one of\r\nMr. M's friends. We have heard some other particulars about the\r\naffray, but we abstain from giving them, as incidental versions are\r\noften erroneous, and as the whole matter will be submitted to legal\r\ninvestigation. Four of Steele's party, his brother, and three whose\r\nnames are Lenten, Collins and Wills, have been arrested, and are now\r\nconfined in the gaol in this place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Norfolk Beacon,\" July 14, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"A few days since at Claysville, Marshal co., Alabama, Messrs.\r\nNathaniel and Graves W.

Jesse\r\nAllen, Alexander and Arthur McFarlane, and Daniel Dickerson. The\r\nSteeles, it appears, last year killed James McFarlane and another\r\nperson in a similar manner, which led to this dreadful retaliation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Montgomery (Ala.)

Philips and Dickerson,\r\nphysicians. Mr. P. is brother to the wife of V. Bleevin Esq., a rich\r\ncotton planter in that neighborhood; the latter has a very lovely\r\ndaughter, to whom Dr. D. paid his addresses. A short time since a\r\ngentleman from Mobile married her. Soon after this, a schoolmaster in\r\nSelma set a cry afloat to the effect, that he had heard Dr. D. say\r\nthings about the lady's conduct before marriage which ought not to be\r\nsaid about any lady. Dr. D. denied having said such things, and the\r\nother denied having spread the story; but neither denials sufficed to\r\npacify the enraged parent. He met Dr. D. fired at him two pistols, and\r\nwounded him. Dr. D. was unarmed, and advanced to Mr. Bleevin, holding\r\nup his hands imploringly, when Mr. B. drew a Bowie knife, and stabbed\r\nhim to the heart. The doctor dropped dead on the spot: and Mr. Bleevin\r\nhas been held to bail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from the \"Alabama, Intelligencer,\" Sept. 17,\r\n1838.\r\n\r\n\"On the 5th instant, a deadly rencounter took place in the streets of\r\nRusselville, (our county town,) between John A.

Observer,\" Dec. 1838.\r\n\r\n\"We are informed from private sources, that on last Saturday, a poor\r\nman who was moving westward with his wife and three little children\r\nand driving a small drove of sheep, and perhaps a cow or two, which\r\nwas driven by his family, on arriving in Florence, and while passing\r\nthrough, met with a citizen of that place, who rode into his flock and\r\ncaused him some trouble to keep it together, when the mover informed\r\nthe individual that he must not do so again or he would throw a rock\r\nat him, upon which some words ensued, and the individual again\r\ndisturbed the flock, when the mover, as near as we can learn, threw at\r\nhim upon this the troublesome man got off his horse, went into a\r\ngrocery, got a gun, and came out and deliberately shot the poor\r\nstranger in the presence of his wife and little children. The wounded\r\nman then made an effort to get into some house, when his murderous\r\nassailant overtook and stabbed him to the heart with a _Bowie knife_.\r\nThis revolting scene, we are informed, occurred in the presence of\r\nmany citizens, who, report says, never even lifted their voices in\r\ndefence of the murdered man.\"\r\n\r\nA late number of the \"Flag of the Union,\" published at Tuscalosa, the\r\nseat of the government of Alabama, states that \"since the commencement\r\nof the late session of the legislature of that state, no less than\r\nTHIRTEEN FIGHTS had been had within sight of the capitol.\" _Pistols\r\nand Bowie knives were used in every case_.\r\n\r\nThe present white population of Alabama is about the same with that of\r\nNew Jersey, yet for the last twenty years there has not been so many\r\npublic deadly affrays, and of such a horrible character, in New\r\nJersey, as have taken place in Alabama within the last eight months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nMississippi became one of the United States in 1817.

Dickins and Drane of that place. A\r\nKentuckian happening to be in Canton, spoke of the duel, and charged\r\nMr. Mitchell Calhoun, the second of Drane, with cowardice and\r\nunfairness. Mr. Calhoun called on the Kentuckian for an explanation,\r\nand the offensive charge was repeated. _A challenge and fight with\r\nBowie knives, toe to toe_, were the consequences. Both parties were\r\ndreadfully and dangerously wounded, though neither was dead at the\r\nlast advices. Mr. Calhoun is a brother to the Hon. John Calhoun,\r\nmember of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows the account of the duel referred to above, between\r\nMessrs. Dickins and Drane.\r\n\r\n\"Intelligence has been received in this town of a fatal duel that took\r\nplace in Canton, Miss., on the 28th ult., between Rufus K. Dickins,\r\nand a Mr. Westley Drane.

The principal parties concerned were, Messrs. John W.\r\nScott, James G. Scott, and Edmund B. Hatch. The latter was shot down\r\nand then stabbed twice through the body, by J.G. Scott.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Alabama Beacon\" of Sept. 13, 1838, says:\r\n\r\n\"An attempt was made in Vicksburg lately, by a gang of Lynchers, to\r\ninflict summary punishment on three men of the name of Fleckenstein.\r\nThe assault was made upon the house, about 11 o'clock at night.\r\nMeeting with some resistance from the three Fleckensteins, a leader of\r\nthe gang, by the name of Helt, discharged his pistol, and wounded one\r\nof the brothers severely in the neck and jaws. A volley of four or\r\nfive shots was almost instantly returned, when Helt fell dead, a piece\r\nof the top of the skull being torn off, and almost the whole of his\r\nbrains dashed out. His comrades seeing him fall, suddenly took to\r\ntheir heels. There were, it is supposed, some _ten or fifteen_\r\nconcerned in the transaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Manchester (Miss.) Gazette,\" August 11, 1838, says:\r\n\r\n\"It appears that Mr. Asa Hazeltine, who kept a public or boarding\r\nhouse in Jackson, during the past winter, and Mr. Benjamin Tanner,\r\ncame here about five or six weeks since, with the intention of opening\r\na public house. Foiled in the design, in the settlement of their\r\naffairs some difficulty arose as to a question of veracity between the\r\nparties. Mr. Tanner, deeply excited, procured a pistol and loaded it\r\nwith the charge of death, sought and found the object of his hatred in\r\nthe afternoon, in the yard of Messrs. Kezer & Maynard, and in the\r\npresence of several persons, after repeated and ineffectual attempts\r\non the part of Capt. Jackson to baffle his fell spirit, shot the\r\nunfortunate victim, of which wound Mr. Hazeltine died in a short time.\r\n\r\n\"We understand that Mr. Hazeltine was a native of Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Columbia (S.C.) Telescope,\" Sept. 16, 1837, gives the details\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n\"By a letter from Mississippi, we have an account of a rencontre which\r\ntook place in Rodney, on the 27th July, between Messrs. Thos. J.\r\nJohnston and G.H. Wilcox, both formerly of this city. In consequence\r\nof certain publications made by these gentlemen against each other,\r\nJohnston challenged Wilcox. The latter declining to accept the\r\nchallenge, Johnston informed his friends at Rodney, that he would be\r\nthere at the term of the court then not distant, when he would make an\r\nattack upon him. He repaired thither on the 26th, and on the next\r\nmorning the following communication was read aloud in the presence of\r\nWilcox and a large crowd:\r\n\r\n\"Rodney, July 27, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Johnston informs Mr. Wilcox, that at or about 1 o'clock of this\r\nday, he will be on the common, opposite the Presbyterian Church of\r\nthis town, waiting and expecting Mr. Wilcox to meet him there.\r\n\r\n\"I pledge my honor that Mr. Johnston will not fire at Mr. Wilcox,\r\nuntil he arrives at a distance of one hundred yards from him, and I\r\ndesire Mr. Wilcox or any of his friends, to see that distance\r\naccurately measured.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Johnston will wait there thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n\"J. M. DUFFIELD.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wilcox declined being a party to any such arrangement, and Mr. D.\r\ntold him to be prepared for an attack. Accordingly, about an hour\r\nafter this, Johnston proceeded towards Wilcox's office, armed with a\r\ndouble-barrelled gun, (one of the barrels rifled,) and three pistols\r\nin his belt. He halted about fifty yards from W's door and leveled his\r\ngun. W. withdrew before Johnston could fire, and seized a musket,\r\nreturned to the door and flashed. Johnston fired both barrels without\r\neffect. Wilcox then seized a double barrel gun, and Johnston a musket,\r\nand both again fired. Wilcox sent twenty-three buck shot over\r\nJohnston's head, one of them passing through his hat, and Wilcox was\r\nslightly wounded on both hands, his thigh and leg.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Alabama Beacon,\" May 27, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"An affray of the most barbarous nature was expected to take place in\r\nArkansas opposite Princeton, on Thursday last. The two original\r\nparties have been endeavoring for several weeks, to settle their\r\ndifferences at Natchez. One of the individuals concerned stood\r\npledged, our informant states, to fight three different antagonists in\r\none day. The fights, we understand, were to be with pistols; but a\r\nvariety of other weapons were taken along--among others, the deadly\r\nBowie knife. These latter instruments, we are told, were whetted and\r\ndressed up at Grand Gulf, as the parties passed up, avowedly with the\r\nintention of being used in the field.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Southern (Miss) Argus,\" Nov. 21, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"We learn that, at a wood yard above Natchez, on Sunday evening last,\r\na difficulty arose between Captain Crosly, of the steamboat Galenian,\r\nand one of his deck passengers. Capt. C. drew a Bowie knife, and made\r\na pass at the throat of the passenger, which failed to do any harm,\r\nand the captain then ordered him to leave his boat. The man went on\r\nboard to get his baggage, and the captain immediately sought the cabin\r\nfor a pistol. As the passenger was about leaving the boat, the captain\r\npresented a pistol to his breast, which snapped. Instantly the enraged\r\nand wronged individual seized Capt. Crosly by the throat, and brought\r\nhim to the ground, when he drew a dirk and stabbed him eight or nine\r\ntimes in the breast, each blow driving the weapon into his body up to\r\nthe hilt. The passenger was arrested, carried to Natchez, tried and\r\nacquitted.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Planter's Intelligencer\" publishes the following from the\r\nVicksburg Sentinel of June 19, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"About 1 o'clock, we observed two men 'pummeling' one another in the\r\nstreet, to the infinite amusement of a crowd. Presently a third hero\r\nmade his appearance in the arena, with Bowie knife in hand, and he\r\ncried out, \"Let me come at him!\" Upon hearing this threat, one of the\r\npugilists 'took himself off,' our hero following at full speed.\r\nFinding his pursuit was vain, our hero returned, when an attack was\r\ncommenced upon another individual. He was most cruelly beat, and cut\r\nthrough the skull with a knife; it is feared the wounds will prove\r\nmortal. The sufferer, we learn, is an inoffensive German.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Mississippian,\" Nov. 9, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"On Tuesday evening last, 23d, an affray occurred at the town of\r\nTallahasse, in this county, between Hugh Roark and Captain Flack,\r\nwhich resulted in the death of Roark. Roark went to bed, and Flack,\r\nwho was in the barroom below, observed to some persons there, that he\r\nbelieved they had set up Roark to whip him; Roark, upon hearing his\r\nname mentioned, got out of bed and came downstairs. Flack met and\r\nstabbed him in the lower part of his abdomen with a knife, letting out\r\nhis bowels. Roark ran to the door, and received another stab in the\r\nback. He lived until Thursday night, when he expired in great agony.\r\nFlack was tried before a justice of the peace, and we understand was\r\nonly held to bail to appear at court in the event Roark should die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Grand Gulf Advertiser\" Nov. 7, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"_Attempt at Riot at Natchez_.--The _Courier_ says, that in\r\nconsequence of the discharge of certain individuals who had been\r\narraigned for the murder of a man named _Medill_, a mob of about 200\r\npersons assembled on the night of the 1st instant, with the avowed\r\npurpose of _lynching_ them. But fortunately, the objects of their\r\nvengeance had escaped from town. Foiled in their purpose, the rioters\r\nrepaired to the shantee where the murder was committed, and\r\nprecipitated it over the bluff. The military of the city were ordered\r\nout to keep order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Natchez Free Trader.\"\r\n\r\n\"A violent attack was lately made on Captain Barrett, of the steamboat\r\nSoutherner, by three persons from Wilkinson co., Miss., whose names\r\nare Carey, and one of the name of J.S. Towles. The only reason for the\r\noutrage was, that Captain B. had the assurance to require of the\r\ngentlemen, who were quarreling on board his boat, to keep order for\r\nthe peace and comfort of the other passengers. _Towles_ drew a Bowie\r\nknife upon the Captain; which the latter wrested from him. A pistol,\r\ndrawn by one of the Careys was also taken, and the assailant was\r\nknocked overboard. Fortunately for him he was rescued from drowning.\r\nThe brave band then landed. On her return up the river, the Southerner\r\nstopped at Fort Adams, and on her leaving that place, an armed party,\r\namong whom were the Careys and Towles, fired into the boat, but\r\nhappily the shot missed a crowd of passengers on the hurricane deck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Mississippian,\" Dec. 18, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"Greet Spikes, a citizen of this county, was killed a few days ago,\r\nbetween this place and Raymond, by a man named Pegram. It seems that\r\nPegram and Spikes had been carrying weapons for each other for some\r\ntime past. Pegram had threatened to take Spikes' life on first sight,\r\nfor the base treatment he had received at his hands.\r\n\r\n\"We have heard something of the particulars, but not enough to give\r\nthem at this time. Pegram had not been seen since.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Lynchburg Virginian,\" July 23, 1638, says:\r\n\r\n\"A fatal affray occurred a few days ago in Clinton, Mississippi. The\r\nactors in it were a Mr. Parham, Mr. Shackleford, and a Mr. Henry.\r\nShackleford was killed on the spot, and Henry was slightly wounded by\r\na shot gun with which Parham was armed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Columbus (Ga.) Sentinel,\" Nov. 22, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"_Butchery_.--A Bowie knife slaughter took place a few days since in\r\nHonesville, Miss. A Mr. Hobbs was the victim; Strother the butcher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Vicksburg Sentinel,\" Sept. 28, 1837, says:\r\n\r\n\"It is only a few weeks since humanity was shocked by a most atrocious\r\noutrage, inflicted by the Lynchers, on the person of a Mr. Saunderson\r\nof Madison, co. in this state. They dragged this respectable planter\r\nfrom the bosom of his family, and mutilated him in the most brutal\r\nmanner--maiming him most inhumanly, besides cutting off his nose and\r\nears and scarifying his body to the very ribs! We believe the subject\r\nof this foul outrage still drags out a miserable existence--an object\r\nof horror and of pity. Last week a club of Lynchers, amounting to four\r\nor five individuals, as we have been credibly informed, broke into the\r\nhouse of Mr. Scott of Wilkinson co., a respectable member of the bar,\r\nforced him out, and hung him dead on the next tree. We have heard of\r\nnumerous minor outrages committed against the peace of society, and\r\nthe welfare and happiness of the country; but we mention these as the\r\nmost enormous that we have heard for some months.\r\n\r\n\"It now becomes our painful duty, to notice a most disgraceful outrage\r\ncommitted by the Lynchers of Vicksburg, on last Sunday. The victim was\r\na Mr. Grace, formerly of the neighborhood of Warrenton, Va., but for\r\ntwo years a resident of this city. He was detected in giving free\r\npasses to slaves and brought to trial before Squire Maxey.\r\nUnfortunately for the wretch, either through the want of law or\r\nevidence, he could not be punished, and he was set at liberty by the\r\nmagistrate. The city marshal seeing that a few in the crowd were\r\ndisposed to lay violent hands on the prisoner in the event of his\r\nescaping punishment by law, resolved to accompany him to his house.\r\nThe Lynch mob still followed, and the marshal finding the prisoner\r\ncould only be protected by hurrying him to jail, endeavored to effect\r\nthat object. The Lynchers, however, pursued the officer of the law,\r\ndragged him from his horse, bruised him, and conveyed the prisoner to\r\nthe most convenient point of the city for carrying their blood-thirsty\r\ndesigns into execution. We blush while we record the atrocious deed;\r\nin this city, containing nearly 5,000 souls, in the broad light of\r\nday, this aged wretch was stripped and flogged, we believe within\r\nhearing of the lamentations and the shrieks of his afflicted wife and\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an affray at Montgomery, Mississippi, July 1, 1838, Mr. A.L.\r\nHerbert was killed by Dr. J.B.

Advocate, of Saturday last, states that on the\r\nmorning of the day previous, (the 9th) a dispute arose between Mr.\r\nRobert Smith and Mr. Alexander Eanes, both of Aberdeen, which resulted\r\nin the death of Mr. Smith, who kept a boarding house, and was an\r\namiable man and a good citizen. In the course of the contradictory\r\nwords of the disputants, the lie was given by Eanes, upon which Smith\r\ngathered up a piece of iron and threw it at Eanes, but which missed\r\nhim and lodged in the walls of the house. At this Eanes drew a large\r\ndirk knife, and stabbed Smith in the abdomen, the knife penetrating\r\nthe vitals, and thus causing immediate death. Smith breathed only a\r\nfew seconds after the fatal thrust.\r\n\r\n\"Eanes immediately mounted his horse and rode off, but was pursued by\r\nMr. Hanes, who arrested and took him back, when he was put under guard\r\nto await a trial before the proper authorities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Vicksburg Register,\" Nov. 17, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"On the 2d inst. an affray occurred between one Stephen Scarbrough and\r\nA.W.

The police jury had ordered a road\r\non the right bank of the Mississippi, and the neighboring planters\r\nwere out with their forces to open it. For some offence, Nevils, the\r\nsuperintendent of the operations, flogged two of Harper's negroes. The\r\nnext day the parties met on horseback, when Harper dismounted, and\r\nproceeded to cowskin Nevils for the chastisement inflicted on the\r\nnegroes. Nevils immediately drew a pistol and shot his assailant dead\r\non the spot. Both were gentlemen of the highest respectability.\r\n\r\n\"An affray also came off recently, as the same correspondent writes\r\nus, in Raymond, Hinds co., Miss., which for a serious one, was rather\r\namusing. The sheriff had a process to serve on a man of the name of\r\nBright, and, in consequence of some difficulty and intemperate\r\nlanguage, thought proper to commence the service by the application of\r\nhis cowskin to the defendant. Bright thereupon floored his adversary,\r\nand, wresting his cowhide from him, applied it to its owner to the\r\nextent of at least five hundred lashes, meanwhile threatening to shoot\r\nthe first bystander who attempted to interfere. The sheriff was\r\ncarried home in a state of insensibility, and his life has been\r\ndespaired of. The mayor of the place, however, issued his warrant, and\r\nstarted three of the sheriff's deputies in pursuit of the delinquent,\r\nbut the latter, after keeping them at bay till they found it\r\nimpossible to arrest him, surrendered himself to the magistrate, by\r\nwhom he was bound over to the next Circuit Court. From the mayor's\r\noffice, his honor and the parties litigant proceeded to the tavern to\r\ntake a drink by way of ending hostilities. But the civil functionary\r\nrefused to sign articles of peace by touching glasses with Bright,\r\nwhereupon the latter made a furious assault upon him, and then turned\r\nand flogged 'mine host' within an inch of his life because he\r\ninterfered. Satisfied with his day's work, Bright retired. Can we show\r\nany such specimens of chivalry and refinement in Kentucky!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Grand Gulf (Miss.) Advertiser,\" June 27, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"DEATH BY VIOLENCE.--The moral atmosphere in our state appears to be\r\nin a deleterious and sanguinary condition. _Almost every exchange\r\npaper which reaches us contains some inhuman and revolting case of\r\nmurder or death by violence. Not less than fifteen deaths by violence\r\nhave occurred, to our certain knowledge, within the past three\r\nmonths._ Such a state of things, in a country professing to be moral\r\nand christian, is a disgrace to human nature and is well calculated,\r\nto induce those abroad unacquainted with our general habits and\r\nfeelings, to regard the morals of our people in no very enviable\r\nlight; and does more to injure and weaken our political institutions\r\nthan years of pecuniary distress. The frequency of such events is a\r\nburning disgrace to the morality, civilization, and refinement of\r\nfeeling to which we lay claim and so often boast in comparison with\r\nthe older states. And unless we set about and put an immediate and\r\neffectual termination to such revolting scenes, we shall be compelled\r\nto part with what all genuine southerners have ever regarded as their\r\nrichest inheritance, the proud appellation of the '_brave, high-minded\r\nand chivalrous sons of the south_.'\r\n\r\n\"This done, we should soon discover a change for the better--peace and\r\ngood order would prevail, and the ends of justice be effectually and\r\nspeedily attained, and then the people of this wealthy state would be\r\nin a condition to bid defiance to the disgraceful reproaches which are\r\nnow daily heaped upon them by the religious and moral of other\r\nstates.\"\r\n\r\n\"The present white population of Mississippi is but little more than\r\nhalf as great as that of Vermont, and yet more horrible crimes are\r\nperpetrated by them EVERY MONTH, than have ever been perpetrated in\r\nVermont since it has been a state, now about half a century. Whoever\r\ndoubts it, let him get data and make his estimate, and he will find\r\nthat this is no random guess.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nLouisiana became one of the United States in 1811. Its present white\r\npopulation is about one hundred and fifteen thousand.\r\n\r\nThe extracts which follow furnish another illustration of the horrors\r\nproduced by passions blown up to fury in the furnace of arbitrary\r\npower. We have just been looking over a broken file of Louisiana\r\npapers, including the last six months of 1837, and the whole of 1838,\r\nand find ourselves obliged to abandon our design of publishing even an\r\nabstract of the scores and _hundreds_ of affrays, murders,\r\nassassinations, duels, lynchings, assaults, &c. which took place in\r\nthat state during that period. Those which have taken place in New\r\nOrleans alone, during the last eighteen months, would, in detail, fill\r\na volume. Instead of inserting the details of the principal atrocities\r\nin Louisiana, as in the states already noticed, we will furnish the\r\nreader with the testimony of various editors of newspapers, and\r\nothers, residents of the state, which will perhaps as truly set forth\r\nthe actual state of society there, as could be done by a publication\r\nof the outrages themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"New Orleans Bee,\" of May 23, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"_Contempt of human life._--In view of the crimes which are _daily_\r\ncommitted, we are led to inquire whether it is owing to the\r\ninefficiency of our laws, or to the manner in which those laws are\r\nadministered, that this _frightful deluge of human blood fowl through\r\nour streets and our places of public resort_.\r\n\r\n\"Whither will such contempt for the life of man lead us? The\r\nunhealthiness of the climate mows down annually a part of our\r\npopulation; the murderous steel despatches its proportion; and if\r\ncrime increases as it has, the latter will soon become _the most\r\npowerful agent in destroying life_.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot but doubt the perfection of our criminal code, when we see\r\nthat _almost every criminal eludes the law_, either by boldly avowing\r\nthe crime, or by the tardiness with which legal prosecutions are\r\ncarried on, or, lastly, by the convenient application of _bail_ in\r\ncriminal cases.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"New Orleans Picayune\" of July 30, 1837, says:\r\n\r\n\"It is with the most painful feelings that we _daily_ hear of some\r\n_fatal_ duel. Yesterday we were told of the unhappy end of one of our\r\nmost influential and highly respectable merchants, who fell yesterday\r\nmorning at sunrise in a duel. As usual, the circumstances which led to\r\nthe meeting were trivial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans correspondent of the New York Express, in his letter\r\ndated New Orleans, July 30, 1837, says:\r\n\r\n\"THIRTEEN DUELS have been fought in and near the city during the week;\r\n_five more were to take place this morning_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"New Orleans Merchant\" of March 20, 1838, says:\r\n\r\n\"Murder has been rife within the two or three weeks last past; and\r\nwhat is worse, the authorities of those places where they occur are\r\n_perfectly regardless of the fact_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"New Orleans Bee\" of September 8, 1838, says:\r\n\r\n\"Not two months since, the miserable BARBA became a victim to one of\r\nthe most cold-blooded schemes of assassination that ever disgraced a\r\ncivilized community. Last Sunday evening an individual, Gonzales by\r\nname, was seen in perfect health, in conversation with his friends. On\r\nMonday morning his dead body was withdrawn from the Mississippi, near\r\nthe ferry of the first municipality, in a state of terrible\r\nmutilation. To cap the climax of horror, on Friday morning, about half\r\npast six o'clock, the coroner was called to hold an inquest over the\r\nbody of an individual, between Magazine and Tchoupitoulas streets. The\r\nhead was entirely severed from the body; the lower extremities had\r\nlikewise suffered amputation; the right foot was completely\r\ndismembered from the leg, and the left knee nearly severed from the\r\nthigh. Several stabs, wounds and bruises, were discovered on various\r\nparts of the body, which of themselves were sufficient to produce\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Georgetown (South Carolina) Union\" of May 20, 1837, has the\r\nfollowing extract from a New Orleans paper.\r\n\r\n\"A short time since, two men shot one another down in one of our bar\r\nrooms, one of whom died instantly. A day or two after, one or two\r\ninfants were found murdered, there was every reason to believe, by\r\ntheir own mothers. Last week we had to chronicle a brutal and bloody\r\nmurder, committed in the heart of our city: the very next day a\r\nmurder-trial was commenced in our criminal court: the day ensuing\r\nthis, we published the particulars of Hart's murder. The day after\r\nthat, Tibbetts was hung for attempting to commit a murder; the next\r\nday again we had to publish a murder committed by two Spaniards at the\r\nLake--this was on Friday last. On Sunday we published the account of\r\nanother murder committed by the Italian, Gregorio. On Monday, another\r\nmurder was committed, and the murderer lodged in jail. On Tuesday\r\nmorning another man was stabbed and robbed, and is not likely to\r\nrecover, but the assassin escaped. The same day Reynolds, who killed\r\nBarre, shot himself in prison. On Wednesday, another person, Mr.\r\nNicolet, blew out his brains. Yesterday, the unfortunate George\r\nClement destroyed himself in his cell; and in addition to this\r\ndreadful catalogue we have to add that of the death of two, brothers,\r\nwho destroyed themselves through grief at the death of their mother;\r\nand truly may we say that 'we know not what to-morrow will bring\r\nforth.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Louisiana Advertiser,\" as quoted by the Salt River (Mo.) Journal\r\nof May 25, 1837, says:\r\n\r\n\"Within the last ten or twelve days, three suicides, four murders, and\r\ntwo executions, have occurred in the city!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"New Orleans Bee\" of October 25, 1837, says:\r\n\r\n\"We remark with regret the frightful list of homicides that are\r\n_daily_ committed in New Orleans.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Planter's Banner\" of September 30. 1838, published at Franklin,\r\nLouisiana, after giving an account of an affray between a number of\r\nplanters, in which three were killed and a fourth mortally wounded,\r\nsays that \"Davis (one of the murderers) was arrested by the\r\nby-standers, but a _justice of the peace_ came up and told them, he\r\ndid not think it right to keep a man 'tied in that manner,' and\r\n'thought it best to turn him loose.' _It was accordingly so done_.\"\r\n\r\nThis occurred in the parish of Harrisonburg. The Banner closes the\r\naccount by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Our informant states that _five white men_ and _one_ negro have been\r\nmurdered in the parish of Madison, during the months of July and\r\nAugust.\"\r\n\r\nThis _justice of the peace_, who bade the by-standers unloose the\r\nmurderer, mentioned above, has plenty of birds of his own feather\r\namong the law officers of Louisiana. Two of the leading officers in\r\nthe New Orleans police took two witnesses, while undergoing legal\r\nexamination at Covington, near New Orleans, \"carried them to a\r\nbye-place, and _lynched_ them, during which inquisitorial operation,\r\nthey divulged every thing to the officers, Messrs. Foyle and Crossman.\"\r\nThe preceding fact is published in the Maryland Republican of August\r\n22, 1837.\r\n\r\nJudge Canonge of New Orleans, in his address at the opening of the\r\ncriminal court, Nov. 4, 1837, published in the \"Bee\" of Nov. 8, in\r\nremarking upon the prevalence of out-breaking crimes, says:\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible in a civilized country such crying abuses are\r\n_constantly_ encountered? How many individuals have given themselves\r\nup to such culpable habits! Yet we find magistrates and juries\r\nhesitating to expose crimes of the blackest dye to eternal contempt\r\nand infamy, to the vengeance of the law.\r\n\r\n\"As a Louisianian parent, _I reflect with terror_ that our beloved\r\nchildren, reared to become one day honorable and useful citizens, may\r\nbe the victims of these votaries of vice and licentiousness. Without\r\nsome powerful and certain remedy, _our streets will become butcheries\r\noverflowing with the blood of our citizens_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the \"New Orleans Bee,\" in his paper of Oct. 21, 1837,\r\nhas a long editorial article, in which he argues for the virtual\r\nlegalizing of LYNCH LAW, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We think then that in the circumstances in which we are placed, the\r\nLegislature ought to sanction such measures as the situation of the\r\ncountry render necessary, by giving to justice a _convenient\r\nlatitude_. There are occasions when the delays inseparable from the\r\nadministration of justice would be inimical to the public safety, and\r\nwhen the most fatal consequences would be the result.\r\n\r\n\"It appears to us, that there is an urgent necessity to provide\r\nagainst the inconveniences which result from popular judgment, and to\r\ncheck the disposition for the speedy execution of justice resulting\r\nfrom the unconstitutional principle of a pretended Lynch law, by\r\nauthorizing the parish court to take cognizance without delay, against\r\nevery free man who shall be convicted of a crime; from the accusations\r\narising from the mere provocations to the insurrection of the working\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\"All judicial sentences ought to be based upon law, and the terrible\r\nprivilege which the populace now have of punishing with death certain\r\ncrimes, _ought to be consecrated by law_, powerful interests would not\r\nsuffice in our view to excuse the interruption of social order, if the\r\npublic safety was not with us the supreme law.\r\n\r\n\"This is the reason that whilst we deplore the imperious necessity\r\nwhich exists, we entreat the legislative power to give the sanction of\r\nprinciple to what already exists in fact.\"\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the \"New Orleans Bee,\" in his paper, Oct 25, 1837, says:\r\n\r\n\"We remark with regret the frightful list of homicides, whether\r\njustifiable or not, that are daily committed in New Orleans. It is not\r\nthrough any inherent vice of legal provision that such outrages are\r\nperpetrated with impunity: it is rather in the neglect of the\r\n_application of the law_ which exists on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"We will confine our observation to the dangerous facilities afforded\r\nby this code for the escape of the homicide. We are well aware that\r\nthe laws in question are intended for the distribution of equal\r\njustice, yet we have too often witnessed the acquittal of delinquents\r\nwhom we can denominate by no other title than that of homicides, while\r\nthe simple affirmation of others has been admitted (in default of\r\ntestimony) who are themselves the authors of the deed, for which they\r\nstand in judgment. The _indiscriminate system of accepting bail_ is a\r\nblot on our criminal legislation, and is one great reason why so many\r\nviolators of the law avoid its penalties. To this doubtless must be\r\nascribed the non-interference of the Attorney General. The law of\r\n_habeas corpus_ being subjected to the interpretation of every\r\nmagistrate, whether versed or not in criminal cases, a degree of\r\narbitrary and incorrect explanation necessarily results. How\r\nfrequently does it happen that the Mayor or Recorder decides upon the\r\ngravest case without putting himself to the smallest trouble to inform\r\nthe Attorney General, who sometimes only hears of the affair when\r\ninvestigation is no longer possible, or when the criminal has wisely\r\ncommuted his punishment into temporary or perpetual exile.\"\r\n\r\nThat morality suffers by such practices, is beyond a doubt; yet\r\nmoderation and mercy are so beautiful in themselves, that we would\r\nscarcely protest against indulgence, were it not well known that the\r\nacceptance of bail is the safeguard of every delinquent who, through\r\nwealth or connections, possesses influence enough to obtain it. Here\r\narbitrary construction glides amidst the confusion of testimony; there\r\nit presumes upon the want of evidence, and from one cause or another\r\nit is extremely rare, that a refusal to bail has delivered the accused\r\ninto the hands of justice. In criminal cases, the Court and Jury are\r\nthe proper tribunals to decide upon the reality of the crime, and the\r\npalliating circumstances; _yet it is not unfrequent_ for the public\r\nvoice to condemn as an odious assassin, the very individual who by the\r\nacquittal of the judge, walks at large and scoffs at justice.\r\n\r\n\"It is time to restrict within its proper limits this pretended right\r\nof personal protection; it is time to teach our population to abstain\r\nfrom mutual murder upon slight provocation.--Duelling, Heaven knows,\r\nis dreadful enough, and quite a sufficient means of gratifying private\r\naversion, and avenging insult. Frequent and serious brawls in our\r\ncafes, streets and houses, every where attest the insufficiency or\r\nmisapplication of our legal code, or the want of energy in its organs.\r\nTo say that unbounded license is the insult of liberty is folly.\r\nLiberty is the consequence of well regulated laws--without these,\r\nFreedom can exist only in name, and the law which favors the escape of\r\nthe opulent and aristocratic from the penalties of retribution, but\r\nconsigns the poor and friendless to the chain-gang or the gallows, is\r\nin fact the very essence of slavery!!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor of the same paper says (Nov. 4, 1837.)\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps by an equitable, but strict application of that law, (the law\r\nwhich forbids the wearing of deadly weapons concealed,) the effusion\r\nof human blood might be stopt _which now defiles our streets and our\r\ncoffee-houses as if they were shambles_! Reckless disregard of the\r\nlife of man is rapidly gaining ground among us, and the habit of\r\nseeing a man whom it is taken for granted was armed, murdered merely\r\nfor a _gesture_, may influence the opinion of a jury composed of\r\ncitizens, whom, LONG IMPUNITY TO HOMICIDES OF EVERY KIND has\r\npersuaded, that the right of self-defence extends even to the taking\r\nof life for _gestures_, more or less threatening. So many DAILY\r\ninstances of outbreaking passion which have thrown whole families into\r\nthe deepest affliction, teach us a terrible lesson.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Columbus (Ga.) Sentinel,\" July 6, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"_Wholesale Murders_.--No less than three murders were committed in\r\nNew Orleans on Monday evening last. The first was that of a man in\r\nPoydras, near the corner of Tehapitoulas. The murdered individual had\r\nbeen suspected of a _liason_ with another man's wife in the\r\nneighbourhood, was caught in the act, followed to the above corner and\r\nshot.\r\n\r\n\"The second was that of a man in Perdido street. Circumstances not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\"The third was that of a watchman, on the corner of Custom House and\r\nBurgundy street, who was found dead yesterday morning, shot through\r\nthe heart. The deed was evidently committed on the opposite side from\r\nwhere he was found, as the unfortunate man was tracked by his blood\r\nacross the street. In addition to being shot through the heart, two\r\nwounds in his breast, supposed to have been done with a Bowie knife,\r\nwere discovered. No arrests have been made to our knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor of the \"Charleston, (S.C.) Mercury\" of April, 1837, snakes\r\nthe following remarks.\r\n\r\n\"The energy of a Tacon is much needed to vivify the police of New\r\nOrleans. In a single paper we find an account of the execution of one\r\nman for robbery and intent to kill, of the arrest of another for\r\nstabbing a man to death with a carving knife; and of a third found\r\nmurdered on the Levee on the previous Sunday morning. In the last\r\ncase, although the murderer was known, _no steps had been taken for\r\nhis arrest_; and to crown the whole, it is actually stated in so many\r\nwords, that the City guards are not permitted, according to their\r\ninstructions, to patrol the Levee after night, for fear of attacks\r\nfrom persons employed in steamboats!\"\r\n\r\nThe present white population of Louisiana is but little more than that\r\nof Rhode Island, yet more appalling crime is committed in Louisiana\r\n_every day_, than in Rhode Island during a year, notwithstanding the\r\ntone of public morals is probably lower in the latter than in any\r\nother New England state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTennessee became one of the United States in 1796. Its present white\r\npopulation is about seven hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nThe details which follow, go to confirm the old truth, that the\r\nexercise of arbitrary power tends to make men monsters. The following,\r\nfrom the \"Memphis (Tennessee) Enquirer,\" was published in the Virginia\r\nAdvocate, Jan. 26, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"Below will be found a detailed account of one of the most unnatural\r\nand aggravated murders ever recorded. Col. Ward, the deceased, was a\r\nman of high standing in the state, and very much esteemed by his\r\nneighbors, and by all who knew him. The brothers concerned in this\r\n'murder, most foul and unnatural,' were Lafayette, Chamberlayne,\r\nCaesar, and Achilles Jones, (the nephews of Col. Ward.)\r\n\r\n\"The four brothers, all armed, went to the residence of Mr. A.G. Ward,\r\nin Shelby co., on the evening of 22d instant. They were conducted into\r\nthe room in which Col. Ward was sitting, together with some two or\r\nthree ladies, his intended wife amongst the number. Upon their\r\nentering the room, Col. Ward rose, and extended his hand to Lafayette.\r\nHe refused, saying he would shake hands with no such d----d rascal.\r\nThe rest answered in the same tone. Col. Ward remarked that they were\r\nnot in a proper place for a difficulty, if they sought one. Col. Ward\r\nwent from the room to the passage, and was followed by the brothers.\r\nHe said he was unarmed, but if they would lay down their arms, he\r\ncould whip the whole of them; or if they would place him on an equal\r\nfooting, he could whip the whole of them one by one. Caesar told\r\nChamberlayne to give the Col. one of his pistols, which he did, and\r\nboth went out into the yard, the other brothers following. While\r\nstanding a few paces from each other, Lafayette came up, and remarked\r\nto the Col., 'If you spill my brother's blood, I will spill yours,'\r\nabout which time Chamberlayne's pistol fired, and immediately\r\nLafayette bursted a cap at him. The Colonel turned to Lafayette, and\r\nsaid, 'Lafayette, you intend to kill,' and discharged his pistol at\r\nhim. The ball struck the pistol of Lafayette, and glanced into his\r\narm. By this time Albert Ward, being close by, and hearing the fuss,\r\ncame up to the assistance of the Colonel, when a scuffle amongst all\r\nhands ensued. The Colonel stumbled and fell down--he received several\r\nwounds from a large bowie knife; and, after being stabbed,\r\nChamberlayne jumped upon him, and stamped him several times. After the\r\nscuffle, Caesar Jones was seen to put up a large bowie knife. Colonel\r\nWard said he was a dead man. By the assistance of Albert Ward, he\r\nreached the house, distance about 15 or 20 yards, and in a few minutes\r\nexpired. On examination by the Coroner, it appeared that he had\r\nreceived several wounds from pistols and knives. Albert Ward was also\r\nbadly bruised, not dangerously.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"New Orleans Bee,\" Sept. 22, 1838, published the following from\r\nthe \"Nashville (Tennessee) Whig.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Nashville Whig, of the 11th ult., says: Pleasant Watson, of De\r\nKalb county, and a Mr. Carmichael, of Alabama, were the principals in\r\nan affray at Livingston, Overton county, last week, which terminated\r\nin the death of the former. Watson made the assault with a dirk, and\r\nCarmichael defended himself with a pistol, shooting his antagonist\r\nthrough the body, a few inches below the heart. Watson was living at\r\nthe last account. The dispute grew out of a horse race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans Courier, April 7, 1837, has the following extract from\r\nthe \"McMinersville (Tennessee) Gazette.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday, the 8th instant, Colonel David L. Mitchell, the worthy\r\nsheriff of White county, was most barbarously murdered by a man named\r\nJoseph Little. Colonel Mitchell had a civil process against Little. He\r\nwent to Little's house for the purpose of arresting him. He found\r\nLittle armed with a rifle, pistols, &c. He commenced a conversation\r\nwith Little upon the impropriety of his resisting, and stated his\r\ndetermination to take him, at the same time slowly advancing upon\r\nLittle, who discharged his rifle at him without effect. Mitchell then\r\nattempted to jump in, to take hold of him when Little struck him over\r\nthe head with the barrel of his rifle, and literally mashed his skull\r\nto pieces; and, as he lay prostrate on the earth, Little deliberately\r\npulled a large pistol from his belt, and placing the muzzle close to\r\nMitchell's head, he shot the ball through it. Little has made his\r\nescape. _There were three men near by when the murder was committed,\r\nwho made no attempt to arrest the murderer_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following affray at Athens, Tennessee, from the Mississippian,\r\nAugust 10, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"An unpleasant occurrence transpired at Athens on Monday. Captain\r\nJames Byrnes was stabbed four times, twice in the arm, and twice in\r\nthe side by A.R. Livingston. The wounds are said to be very severe,\r\nand fears are entertained of their proving mortal. The affair\r\nunderwent an examination before Sylvester Nichols, Esq., by whom\r\nLivingston was let to bail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"West Tennessean,\" Aug. 4, 1837, says--\r\n\r\n\"A duel was fought at Calhoun, Tenn., between G.W. Carter and J.C.\r\nSherley. They used yaugers at the distance of 20 yards. The former was\r\nslightly wounded, and the latter quite dangerously.\"\r\n\r\nJune 23d, 1838, Benjamin Shipley, of Hamilton co., Tennessee, shot\r\nArchibald McCallie. (_Nashville Banner_, July 16, 1838.)\r\n\r\nJune 23d, 1838, Levi Stunston, of Weakly co., Tennessee, killed\r\nWilliam Price, of said county, in an affray. (_Nashville Banner, July\r\n6, 1838_.)\r\n\r\nOctober 8, 1838, in an affray at Wolf's Ferry, Tennessee, Martin\r\nFarley, Senior, was killed by John and Solomon Step. (_Georgia\r\nTelegraph, Nov 6, 1838._.)\r\n\r\nFeb. 14, 1838, John Manie was killed by William Doss at Decatur,\r\nTennessee. (_Memphis Gazette, May 15, 1838_.)\r\n\r\n  \"From the Nashville Whig.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Fatal Affray in Columbia, Tenn_.--A fatal street encounter occurred\r\nat that place, on the 3d inst., between Richard H. Hays, attorney at\r\nlaw, and Wm. Polk, brother to the Hon. Jas. K. Polk. The parties met,\r\narmed with pistols, and exchanged shots simultaneously. A buck-shot\r\npierced the brain of Hays, and he died early the next morning. The\r\nquarrel grew out of a sportive remark of Hays', at dinner, at the\r\nColumbia Inn, for which he offered an apology, not accepted, it seems,\r\nas Polk went to Hays' office, the same evening, and chastised him with\r\na whip. This occurred on Friday, the fatal result took place on\r\nMonday.\"\r\n\r\nIn a fight near Memphis, Tennessee, May 15, 1837, Mr. Jackson, of that\r\nplace, shot through the heart Mr. W.F. Gholson, son of the late Mr.\r\nGholson, of Virginia. (_Raleigh Register, June 13, 1837_.)\r\n\r\nThe following horrible outrage, committed in West Tennessee, not far\r\nfrom Randolph, was published by the Georgetown (S.C.) Union, May 26,\r\n1837, from the Louisville Journal.\r\n\r\n\"A feeble bodied man settled a few years ago on the Mississippi, a\r\nshort distance below Randolph, on the Tennessee side. He succeeded in\r\namassing property to the value of about $14,000, and, like most of the\r\nsettlers, made a business of selling wood to the boats. This he sold\r\nat $2.50 a cord, while his neighbors asked $3. One of them came to\r\nremonstrate against his underselling, and had a fight with his\r\nbrother-in-law Clark, in which he was beaten. He then went and\r\nobtained legal process against Clark, and returned with a deputy\r\nsheriff, attended by a posse of desperate villains. When they arrived\r\nat Clark's house, he was seated among his children--they put two or\r\nthree balls through his body. Clark ran, was overtaken and knocked\r\ndown; in the midst of his cries for mercy, one of the villains fired a\r\npistol in his mouth, killing him instantly. They then required the\r\nsettler to sell his property to them, and leave the country. He,\r\nfearing that they would otherwise take his life, sold them his\r\nvaluable property for $300, and departed with his family. _The sheriff\r\nwas one of the purchasers._\"\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore American, Feb. 8, 1838, publishes the following from the\r\nNashville (Tennessee) Banner:\r\n\r\n\"A most atrocious murder was committed a few days ago at Lagrange, in\r\nthis state, on the body of Mr. John T. Foster, a respectable merchant\r\nof that town. The perpetrators of this bloody act are E. Moody, Thomas\r\nMoody, J.E. Douglass, W.R. Harris, and W.C. Harris. The circumstances\r\nattending this horrible affair, are the following:--On the night\r\nprevious to the murder, a gang of villains, under pretence of wishing\r\nto purchase goods, entered Mr. Foster's store, took him by force, and\r\nrode him through the streets _on a rail_. The next morning, Mr. F. met\r\none of the party, and gave him a caning. For this just retaliation for\r\nthe outrage which had been committed on his person, he was pursued by\r\nthe persons alone named, while taking a walk with a friend, and\r\nmurdered in the open face of day.\"\r\n\r\nThe following presentment of a Tennessee Grand Jury, sufficiently\r\nexplains and comments on itself:\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jurors empanelled to inquire for the county of Shelby, would\r\nseparate without having discharged their duties, if they were to omit\r\nto notice public evils which they have found their powers inadequate\r\nto put in train for punishment. The evils referred to exist more\r\nparticularly in the town of Memphis.\r\n\r\nThe audacity and frequency with which outrages are committed, forbid\r\nus, in justice to our consciences, to omit to use the powers we\r\npossess, to bring them to the severe action of the law; and when we\r\nfind our powers inadequate, to draw upon them public attention, and\r\nthe rebuke of the good.\r\n\r\nAn infamous female publicly and grossly assaults a lady; therefore a\r\npublic meeting is called, the mayor of the town is placed in the\r\nchair, resolutions are adopted, providing for the summary and lawless\r\npunishment of the wretched woman. In the progress of the affair,\r\n_hundreds of citizens_ assemble at her house, and raze it to the\r\nground. The unfortunate creature, together with two or three men of\r\nlike character, are committed, in an open canoe or boat, without oar\r\nor paddle, to the middle of the Mississippi river.\r\n\r\nSuch is a concise outline of the leading incidents of a recent\r\ntransaction in Memphis. It might be filled up by the detail of\r\nindividual exploits, which would give vivacity to the description; but\r\nwe forbear to mention them. We leave it to others to admire the\r\nmanliness of the transaction, and the courage displayed by a mob of\r\nhundreds, in the various outrages upon the persons and property of\r\nthree or four individuals who fell under its vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe present white population of Tennessee is about the same with that\r\nof Massachusetts, and yet more outbreaking crimes are committed in\r\nTennessee in a _single month_, than in Massachusetts during a whole\r\nyear; and this, too, notwithstanding the largest town in Tennessee has\r\nbut six thousand inhabitants; whereas, in Massachusetts, besides one\r\nof eighty thousand, and two others of nearly twenty thousand each,\r\nthere are at least a dozen larger than the chief town in Tennessee,\r\nwhich gives to the latter state an important advantage on the score of\r\nmorality, the country being so much more favorable to it than large\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY.\r\n\r\n\r\nKentucky has been one of the United States since 1792. Its present\r\nwhite population is about six hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nThe details which follow show still further that those who unite to\r\nplunder of their rights one class of human beings, regard as _sacred_\r\nthe rights of no class.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following affair at Maysville, Kentucky, is extracted from the\r\nMaryland Republican, January 30, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"A fight came on at Maysville, Ky. on the 29th ultimo, in which a Mr.\r\nCoulster was stabbed in the side and is dead; a Mr. Gibson was well\r\nhacked with a knife; a Mr. Ferris was dangerously wounded in the head,\r\nand another of the same name in the hip; a Mr. Shoemaker was severely\r\nbeaten, and several others seriously hurt in various ways.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is extracted from the N.C. Standard.\r\n\r\n\"A most bloody and shocking transaction took place in the little town\r\nof Clinton, Hickman co. Ken. The circumstances are briefly as follows:\r\nA special canvass for a representative from the county of Hickman, had\r\nfor some time been in progress. A gentleman by the name of Binford was\r\na candidate. The State Senator from the district, Judge James, took\r\nsome exceptions to the reputation of Binford, and intimated that if B.\r\nshould be elected, he (James) would resign rather than serve with such\r\na colleague. Hearing this, Binford went to the house of James to\r\ndemand an explanation. Mrs. James remarked, in a jest as Binford\r\nthought, that if she was in the place of her husband she would resign\r\nher seat in the Senate, and not serve with such a character. B. told\r\nher that she was a woman, and could say what she pleased. She replied\r\nthat she was not in earnest. James then looked B. in the face and said\r\nthat, if his wife said so, it was the fact--'he was an infamous\r\nscoundrel and d----d rascal.' He asked B. if he was armed, and on\r\nbeing answered in the affirmative, he stepped into an adjoining room\r\nto arm himself; He was prevented by the family from returning, and\r\nBinford walked out. J. then told him from his piazza, that he would\r\nmeet him next day in Clinton.\r\n\r\n\"True to their appointment, the enraged parties met on the streets the\r\nfollowing day. James shot first, his ball passing through his\r\nantagonist's liver, whose pistol fired immediately afterwards, and\r\nmissing J., the ball pierced the head of a stranger by the name of\r\nCollins, who instantly fell and expired. After being shot, Binford\r\nsprang upon J. with the fury of a wounded tiger, and would have taken\r\nhis life but for a second shot received through the back from Bartin\r\nJames, the brother of Thomas. Even after he received the last fatal\r\nwound he struggled with his antagonist until death relaxed his grasp,\r\nand he fell with the horrid exclamation, _'I am a dead man!'_\r\n\r\n\"Judge James gave himself up to the authorities; and when the\r\ninformant of the editor left Clinton, Binford, and the unfortunate\r\nstranger lay shrouded corpses together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"N.O. Bee\" thus gives the conclusion of the matter:\r\n\r\n\"Judge James was tried and acquitted, the death of Binford being\r\nregarded as an act of justifiable homicide.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Flemingsburg Kentuckian,\" June 23,'38.\r\n\r\nAFFRAY.--Thomas Binford, of Hickman county, Kentucky, recently attacked\r\na Mr. Gardner of Dresden, with a drawn knife, and cut his face pretty\r\nbadly. Gardner picked up a piece of iron and gave him a side-wipe\r\nabove the ear that brought him to terms. The skull was fractured about\r\ntwo inches. Binford's brother was killed at Clinton, Kentucky, last\r\nfall by Judge James.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Red River Whig\" of September 15, 1838, says:--\"A ruffian of the\r\nname of Charles Gibson, attempted to murder a girl named Mary Green,\r\nof Louisville, Ky. on the 23d ult. He cut her in six different places\r\nwith a Bowie knife. His object, as stated in a subsequent\r\ninvestigation before the Police Court, was to cut her throat, which\r\nshe prevented by throwing up her arms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Louisville Advertiser,\" Dec. 17th, 1838:--\"A startling\r\ntragedy occurred in this city on Saturday evening last, in which A.H.\r\nMeeks was instantly killed, John Rothwell mortally wounded, William\r\nHolmes severely wounded, and Henry Oldham slightly, by the use of\r\nBowie knives, by Judge E.C. Wilkinson, and his brother, B.R.\r\nWilkinson, of Natchez, and J. Murdough, of Holly Springs, Mississippi.\r\nIt seems that Judge Wilkinson had ordered a coat at the shop of\r\nMessrs. Varnum & Redding. The coat was made; the Judge, accompanied by\r\nhis brother and Mr. Murdough, went to the shop of Varnum & Redding,\r\ntried on the coat, and was irritated because, as he believed, it did\r\nnot fit him. Mr. Redding undertook to convince him that he was in\r\nerror, and ventured to assure the Judge that the coat was well made.\r\nThe Judge instantly seized an iron poker, and commenced an attack on\r\nRedding. The blow with the poker was partially warded off--Redding\r\ngrappled his assailant, when a companion of the Judge drew a Bowie\r\nknife, and, but for the interposition and interference of the\r\nunfortunate Meeks, a journeyman tailor, and a gentleman passing by at\r\nthe moment, Redding might have been assassinated in his own shop.\r\nShortly afterwards, Redding, Meeks, Rothwell, and Holmes went to the\r\nGalt House. They sent up stairs for Judge Wilkinson, and he came down\r\ninto the bar room, when angry words were passed. The Judge went up\r\nstairs again, and in a short time returned with his companions, all\r\narmed with knives. Harsh language was again used. Meeks, felt called\r\non to state what he had seen of the conflict, and did so, and Murdough\r\ngave him the d--d lie, for which Meeks struck him. On receiving the\r\nblow with the whip, Murdough instantly plunged his Bowie knife into\r\nthe abdomen of Meeks, and killed him on the spot.\r\n\r\n\"At the same instant B.R. Wilkinson attempted to get at Redding, and\r\nHolmes and Rothwell interfered, or joined in the affray. Holmes was\r\nwounded, probably by B.R. Wilkinson; and the Judge, having left the\r\nroom for an instant, returned, and finding Rothwell contending with\r\nhis brother, or bending over him, he (the Judge) stabbed Rothwell in\r\nthe back, and inflicted a mortal wound.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Wilkinson, his brother, and J. Murdough, have been recently\r\ntried and ACQUITTED.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the \"New Orleans Bee,\" Sept. 27, 1838.\r\n\r\n\"It appears from the statement of the Lexington Intelligencer, that\r\nthere has been for some time past, an enmity between the drivers of\r\nthe old and opposition lines of stages running from that city. On the\r\nevening of the 13th an encounter took place at the Circus between two\r\nof them, Powell and Cameron, and the latter was so much injured that\r\nhis life was in imminent danger. About 12 o'clock the same night,\r\nseveral drivers of the old line rushed into Keizer's Hotel, where\r\nPowell and other drivers of the opposition-line boarded, and a general\r\nmelee took place, in the course of which several pistols were\r\ndischarged, the ball of one of them passing through the head of\r\nCrabster, an old line driver, and killing him on the spot. Crabster,\r\nbefore he was shot, had discharged his own pistol which had burst into\r\nfragments. Two or three drivers of the opposition were wounded with\r\nbuck shot, but not dangerously.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Mobile Advertiser\" of September 15, 1838, copies the following\r\nfrom the Louisville (Ky.) Journal.\r\n\r\n\"A Mr. Campbell was killed in Henderson county on the 31st ult. by a\r\nMr. Harrison. It appears, that there was an affray between the parties\r\nsome months ago, and that Harrison subsequently left home and returned\r\non the 31st in a trading boat. Campbell met him at the boat with a\r\nloaded rifle and declared his determination to kill him, at the same\r\ntime asking him whether he had a rifle and expressing a desire to give\r\nhim a fair chance. Harrison affected to laugh at the whole matter and\r\ninvited Campbell into his boat to take a drink with him. Campbell\r\naccepted the invitation, but, while he was in the act of drinking,\r\nHarrison seized his rifle, fired it off, and laid Campbell dead by\r\nstriking him with the barrel of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Missouri Republican\" of July 29, 1837 published the details which\r\nfollow from the Louisville Journal.\r\n\r\nMOUNT STERLING, Ky. July 20, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen:--A most unfortunate and fatal occurrence transpired in our\r\ntown last evening, about 6 o'clock. Some of the most prominent friends\r\nof Judge French had a meeting yesterday at Col. Young's, near this\r\nplace, and warm words ensued between Mr. Albert Thomas and Belvard\r\nPeters, Esq., and a few blows were exchanged, and several of the\r\nfriends of each collected at the spot. Whilst the parties were thus\r\nengaged. Mr. Wm. White, who was a friend of Mr. Peters, struck Mr.\r\nThomas, whereupon B.F. Thomas Esq. engaged in the combat on the side\r\nof his brother and Mr. W. Roberts on the part of Peters--Mr. G.W.\r\nThomas taking part with his brothers. Albert Thomas had Peters down\r\nand was taken off by a gentleman present, and whilst held by that\r\ngentleman, he was struck by White; and B.F. Thomas having made some\r\nremark White struck him. B.F. Thomas returned the blow, and having a\r\nlarge knife, stabbed White, who nevertheless continued the contest,\r\nand, it is said, broke Thomas's arm with a rock of a chair. Thomas\r\nthen inflicted some other stabs, of which White died in a few minutes.\r\nRoberts was knocked down twice by Albert Thomas, and, I believe, is\r\nmuch hurt. G.W. Thomas was somewhat hurt also. White and B.F. Thomas\r\nhad always been on friendly terms. You are acquainted with the Messrs.\r\nThomas. Mr. White was a much larger man than either of them, weighing\r\nnearly 200 pounds, and in the prime of life. As you may very naturally\r\nsuppose, great excitement prevails here, and Mr. B.F. Thomas regrets\r\nthe fatal catastrophe as much as any one else, but believes from all\r\nthe circumstances that he was justifiable in what he did, although he\r\nwould be as far from doing such an act when cool and deliberate as any\r\nman whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"New Orleans Bulletin\" of Aug. 24, 1838, extracts the following\r\nfrom the Louisville Journal.\r\n\r\n\"News has just reached us, that Thomas P. Moore, attacked the Senior\r\nEditor of this paper in the yard of the Harrodsburg Springs. Mr. Moore\r\nadvanced upon Mr. Prentice with a drawn pistol and fired at him; Mr.\r\nPrentice then fired, neither shot taking effect. Mr. Prentice drew a\r\nsecond pistol, when Mr. Moore quailed and said he had no other arms;\r\nwhereupon Mr. Prentice from superabundant magnanimity spared the\r\nmiscreant's life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Floridian\" of June 10, 1837. MURDER. Mr. Gillespie, a\r\nrespectable citizen aged 50, was murdered a few days since by a Mr.\r\nArnett, near Mumfordsville, Ky., which latter shot his victim twice\r\nwith a rifle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Augusta (Ga.) Sentinel,\" May 11, 1838, has the following account\r\nof murders in Kentucky:\r\n\r\n\"At Mill's Point, Kentucky, Dr. Thomas Rivers was shot one day last\r\nweek, from out of a window, by Lawyer Ferguson, both citizens of that\r\nplace, and both parties are represented to have stood high in the\r\nestimation of the community in which they lived. The difficulty we\r\nunderstand to have grown out of a law suit at issue between them.\"\r\n\r\nJust as our paper was going to press, we learn that the brother of Dr.\r\nRivers, who had been sent for, had arrived, and immediately shot\r\nLawyer Ferguson. He at first shot him with a shot gun, upon his\r\nretreat, which did not prove fatal; he then approached him immediately\r\nwith a pistol, and killed him on the spot.\"\r\n\r\nThe Right Rev. B.B. Smith, Bishop of the Episcopal diocese of\r\nKentucky, published about two years since an article in the Lexington\r\n(Ky.) Intelligencer, entitled \"Thoughts on the frequency of homicides\r\nin the state of Kentucky.\" We conclude this head with a brief extract\r\nfrom the testimony of the Bishop, contained in that article.\r\n\r\n\"The writer has never conversed with a traveled and enlightened\r\nEuropean or eastern man, who has not expressed the most undisguised\r\nhorror at the frequency of homicide and murder within our bounds, and\r\nat the _ease with which the homicide escapes from punishment_.\r\n\r\n\"As to the frequency of these shocking occurrences, the writer has\r\nsome opportunity of being correctly impressed, by means of a yearly\r\ntour through many counties of the State. He has also been particular\r\nin making inquiries of our most distinguished legal and political\r\ncharacters, and from some has derived conjectural estimates which were\r\ntruly alarming. A few have been of the opinion, that on an average one\r\nmurder a year may be charged to the account of every county in the\r\nstate, making the frightful aggregate of 850 human lives sacrificed to\r\nrevenge, or the victims of momentary passion, in the course of every\r\nten years.\r\n\r\n\"Others have placed the estimate much lower, and have thought that\r\nthirty for the whole state, every year, would be found much nearer the\r\ntruth. An attempt has been made lately to obtain data more\r\nsatisfactory than conjecture, and circulars have been addressed to the\r\nclerks of most of the counties, in order to arrive at as correct an\r\nestimate as possible of the actual number of homicides during the\r\nthree years last past. It will be seen, however, that statistics thus\r\nobtained, even from every county in the state, would necessarily be\r\nimperfect, inasmuch as the records of the courts _by no means show all\r\nthe cases_, which occur, some escaping without _any_ of the forms of a\r\nlegal examination, and there being _many affrays_ which end only in\r\nwounds, or where the parties are separated.\r\n\r\n\"From these returns, it appears that in 27 counties there have been,\r\nwithin the last three years, of homicides of every grade, 35, but only\r\n8 convictions in the same period, leaving 27 cases which have passed\r\nwholly unpunished. During the same period there have been from\r\neighty-five counties, only eleven commitments to the state prison,\r\nnine for manslaughter, and two for shooting with intent to kill, _and\r\nnot an instance of capital punishment in the person of any white\r\noffender_. Thus an approximation is made to a general average, which\r\nprobably would not vary much from one in each county every three\r\nyears, or about 280 in ten years.\r\n\r\n\"It is believed that such a register of crime amongst a people\r\nprofessing the protestant religion and speaking the English language,\r\nis not to be found, with regard to any three-quarters of a million of\r\npeople, since the downfall of the feudal system. Compared with the\r\nrecords of crime in Scotland, or the eastern states, the results are\r\nABSOLUTELY SHOCKING! _It is believed there are more homicides, on an\r\naverage of two years, in any of our more populous counties, than in\r\nthe whole of several of our states, of equal or nearly equal white\r\npopulation with Kentucky._\r\n\r\n\"The victims of these affrays are not always, by any means, the most\r\nworthless of our population.\r\n\r\n\"It too often happens that the enlightened citizen, the devoted\r\nlawyer, the affectionate husband, and precious father, are thus\r\ninstantaneously taken from their useful stations on earth, and\r\nhurried, all unprepared, to their final account!\r\n\r\n\"The question, is again asked, what could have brought about, and can\r\nperpetuate, this shocking state of things?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the recklessness of life in Kentucky, and the\r\nterrible paralysis of public sentiment, the bishop states the\r\nfollowing fact.\r\n\r\n\"A case of shocking homicide is remembered, where the guilty person\r\nwas acquitted by a sort of acclamation, and the next day was seen in\r\npublic, with two ladies hanging on his arm!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the frightful frequency of deadly affrays in Kentucky,\r\nas is certified by the above testimony of Bishop Smith, there are\r\nfewer, in proportion to the white population, than in any of the\r\nstates which have passed under review, unless Tennessee may be an\r\nexception. The present white population of Kentucky is perhaps seventy\r\nthousand more than that of Maine, and yet more public fatal affrays\r\nhave taken place in the former, within the last six months, than in\r\nthe latter during its entire existence as a state.\r\n\r\nThe seven slave states which we have already passed under review, are\r\njust one half of the slave states and territories, included in the\r\nAmerican Union. Before proceeding to consider the condition of society\r\nin the other slave states, we pause a moment to review the ground\r\nalready traversed.\r\n\r\nThe present entire white population of the states already considered,\r\nis about two and a quarter millions; just about equal to the present\r\nwhite population of the state of New York. If the amount of crime\r\nresulting in loss of life, which is perpetrated by the white\r\npopulation of those states upon the _whites alone_, be contrasted with\r\nthe amount perpetrated in the state of New York, by _all_ classes,\r\nupon _all_, we believe it will be found, that more of such crimes have\r\nbeen committed in these states within the last 18 months, than have\r\noccurred in the state of New York for half a century. But perhaps we\r\nshall be told that in these seven states, there are scores of cities\r\nand large towns, and that a majority of all these deadly affrays, &c.,\r\ntake place in _them_; to this we reply, that there are _three times as\r\nmany_ cities and large towns in the state of New York, as in all those\r\nstates together, and that nearly all the capital crimes perpetrated in\r\nthe state take place in these cities and large villages. In the state\r\nof New York, there are more than _half a million_ of persons who live\r\nin cities and villages of more than two thousand inhabitants, whereas\r\nin Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and\r\nMissouri, there are on the largest computation not more than _one\r\nhundred thousand_ persons, residing in cities and villages of more\r\nthan two thousand inhabitants, and the white population of these\r\nplaces (which alone is included in the estimate of crime, and that too\r\n_inflicted upon whites only_,) is probably not more than _sixty-five\r\nthousand_.\r\n\r\nBut it will doubtless be pleaded in mitigation, that the cities and\r\nlarge villages in those states are _new_; that they have not had\r\nsufficient time thoroughly to organize their police, so as to make it\r\nan effectual terror to evil doers; and further, that the rapid growth\r\nof those places has so overloaded the authorities with all sorts of\r\nresponsibilities, that due attention to the preservation of the public\r\npeace has been nearly impossible; and besides, they have had no\r\nofficial experience to draw upon, as in the older cities, the offices\r\nbeing generally filled by young men, as a necessary consequence of the\r\nnewness of the country, &c. To this we reply, that New Orleans is more\r\nthan a century old, and for half that period has been the centre of a\r\ngreat trade; that St. Louis, Natchez, Mobile, Nashville, Louisville\r\nand Lexington, are all half a century old, and each had arrived at\r\nyears of discretion, while yet the sites of Buffalo, Rochester,\r\nLockport, Canandaigua, Geneva, Auburn, Ithaca, Oswego, Syracuse, and\r\nother large towns in Western New-York, _were a wilderness_. Further,\r\nas _a number_ of these places are larger than _either_ of the former,\r\ntheir growth must have been more _rapid_, and, consequently, they must\r\nhave encountered still greater obstacles in the organization of an\r\nefficient police than those south western cities, with this exception,\r\nTHEY WERE NOT SETTLED BY SLAVEHOLDERS.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of assigning the _newness_ of the country, the\r\nunrestrained habits of pioneer settlers, the recklessness of life\r\nengendered by wars with the Indians, &c., as reasons sufficient to\r\naccount for the frightful amount of crime in the states under review,\r\nis manifest from the fact, that Vermont is of the same age with\r\nKentucky; Ohio, ten years younger than Kentucky, and six years younger\r\nthan Tennessee; Indiana, five years younger than Louisiana; Illinois,\r\none year younger than Mississippi; Maine, of the same age with\r\nMissouri, and two years younger than Alabama; and Michigan of the same\r\nage with Arkansas. Now, let any one contrast the state of society in\r\nMaine, Vermont, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan with that of\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Missouri, Louisiana, Arkansas, and\r\nMississippi, and candidly ponder the result. It is impossible\r\nsatisfactorily to account for the immense disparity in crime, on any\r\nother supposition than that the latter states were settled and are\r\ninhabited almost exclusively by those who carried with them the\r\nviolence, impatience of legal restraint, love of domination, fiery\r\npassions, idleness, and contempt of laborious industry, which are\r\nengendered by habits of despotic sway, acquired by residence in\r\ncommunities where such manners, habits and passions, mould society\r\ninto their own image.[43] The practical workings of this cause are\r\npowerfully illustrated in those parts of the slave states where slaves\r\nabound, when contrasted with those where very few are held. Who does\r\nnot know that there are fewer deadly affrays in proportion to the\r\nwhite population--that law has more sway and that human life is less\r\ninsecure in East Tennessee, where there are very few slaves, than in\r\nWest Tennessee, where there are large numbers. This is true also of\r\nnorthern and western Virginia, where few slaves are held, when\r\ncontrasted with eastern Virginia; where they abound; the same remark\r\napplies to those parts of Kentucky and Missouri, where large numbers\r\nof slaves are held, when contrasted with others where there are\r\ncomparatively few.\r\n\r\nWe see the same cause operating to a considerable extent in those\r\nparts of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, settled mainly by slaveholders\r\nand others, who were natives of slave states, in contrast with other\r\nparts of these states settled almost exclusively by persons from free\r\nstates; that affrays and breaches of the peace are far more frequent\r\nin the former than in the latter, is well known to all.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the remaining slave states. Those that have not yet\r\nbeen considered, are Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North and South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, and the territory of Florida. As Delaware has\r\nhardly two thousand five hundred slaves, arbitrary power over human\r\nbeings is exercised by so few persons, that the turbulence infused\r\nthereby into the public mind is but an inconsiderable element, quite\r\ninsufficient to inflame the passions, much less to cast the character\r\nof the mass of the people; consequently, the state of society there,\r\nand the general security of life is but little less than in New Jersey\r\nand Pennsylvania, upon which states it borders on the north and east.\r\nThe same causes operate in a considerable measure, though to a much\r\nless extent to Maryland and in Northern and Western Virginia. But in\r\nlower Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, the\r\ngeneral state of society as it respects the successful triumph of\r\npassion over law, and the consequent and universal insecurity of life\r\nis, in the main, very similar to that of the states already\r\nconsidered. In some portions of each of these states, human life has\r\nprobably as little real protection as in Arkansas, Mississippi and\r\nLouisiana; but generally throughout the former states and sections,\r\nthe laws are not so absolutely powerless as in the latter three.\r\nDeadly affrays, duels, murders, lynchings, &c., are, in proportion to\r\nthe white population, as frequent and as rarely punished in lower\r\nVirginia as in Kentucky and Missouri; in North Carolina and South\r\nCarolina as in Tennessee; and in Georgia and Florida as in Alabama.\r\n\r\nTo insert the criminal statistics of the remaining slave states in\r\ndetail, as those of the states already considered have been presented,\r\nwould, we find, fill more space than can well be spared. Instead of\r\nthis, we propose to exhibit the state of society in all the\r\nslaveholding region bordering on the Atlantic, by the testimony of the\r\nslaveholders themselves, corroborated by a few plain facts. Leaving\r\nout of view Florida, where law is the _most_ powerless, and Maryland\r\nwhere probably it is the _least_ so, we propose to select as a fair\r\nillustration of the actual state of society in the Atlantic\r\nslaveholding regions, North Carolina whose border is but 250 miles\r\nfrom the free states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and Georgia which\r\nconstitutes its south western boundary.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with GEORGIA. This state was settled more than a century\r\nago by a colony under General Oglethorpe. The colony was memorable for\r\nits high toned morality. One of its first regulations was an absolute\r\nprohibition of slavery in every form: but another generation arose,\r\nthe prohibition was abolished, a multitude of slaves were imported,\r\nthe exercise of unlimited power over them lashed up passion to the\r\nspurning of all control, and now the dreadful state of society that\r\nexists in Georgia, is revealed by the following testimony out of her\r\nown mouth.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Darien (Georgia) Telegraph, in his paper of November\r\n6, 1838, published the following.\r\n\r\n\"_Murderous Attack_.--Between the hours of three and four o'clock, on\r\nSaturday last, the editor of this paper was attacked by FOURTEEN armed\r\nruffians, and knocked down by repeated blows of bludgeons. All his\r\nassailants were armed with pistols, dirks, and large clubs. Many of\r\nthem are known to us; but _there is neither law nor justice to be had\r\nin Darien! We are doomed to death_ by the employers of the assassins\r\nwho attacked us on Saturday, and no less than our blood will satisfy\r\nthem. The cause alleged for this unmanly, base, cowardly outrage, is\r\nsome expressions which occurred in an election squib, printed at this\r\noffice, and extensively circulated through the county, _before the\r\nelection_. The names of those who surrounded us, when the attack was\r\nmade, are, A. Lefils, jr. (son to the representative), Madison Thomas,\r\nFrancis Harrison, Thomas Hopkins, Alexander Blue, George Wing, James\r\nEilands, W.I. Perkins, A.J. Raymur: the others we cannot at present\r\nrecollect. The two first, LEFILS and THOMAS struck us at the same\r\ntime. Pistols were levelled at us in all directions. We can produce\r\nthe most respectable testimony of the truth of this statement.\"\r\n\r\nThe same number of the \"Darien Telegraph,\" from which the preceding is\r\ntaken, contains a correspondence between six individuals, settling the\r\npreliminaries of duels. The correspondence fills, with the exception\r\nof a dozen lines, _five columns_ of the paper. The parties were Col.\r\nW. Whig Hazzard, commander of one of the Georgia regiments in the\r\nrecent Seminole campaign, Dr. T.F. Hazzard, a physician of St.\r\nSimons, and Thomas Hazzard, Esq. a county magistrate, on the one side,\r\nand Messrs. J.A. Willey, A.W. Willey, and H.B. Gould, Esqs. of\r\nDarien, on the other. In their published correspondence the parties\r\ncall each other \"liar,\" \"mean rascal,\" \"puppy,\" \"villain,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, Thomas Hazzard, who accepts the challenge of J.A.\r\nWilley, says, in one of his letters, \"Being a magistrate, under a\r\nsolemn oath to do all in my power to keep the peace,\" &c., and yet\r\nthis personification of Georgia justice superscribes his letter as\r\nfollows: \"To the Liar, Puppy, Fool, and Poltroon, Mr. John A. Willey\"\r\nThe magistrate closes his letter thus:\r\n\r\n\"Here I am; call upon me for personal satisfaction (in _propria\r\nforma_); and in the Farm Field, on St. Simon's Island, (_Deo\r\njuvante_,) I will give you a full front of my body, and do all in my\r\npower to satisfy your thirst for blood! And more, I will wager you\r\n$100, to be planked on the scratch! that J.A. Willey will neither\r\nkill or defeat T.F.

Whig Hazzard is one of the most prominent citizens in the\r\nsouthern part of Georgia, and previously signalized himself, as we\r\nlearn from one of the letters in the correspondence, by \"three\r\ndeliberate rounds in a duel.\"\r\n\r\nThe Macon (Georgia) Telegraph of October 9, 1838, contains the\r\nfollowing notice of two affrays in that place, in each of which an\r\nindividual was killed, one on Tuesday and the other on Saturday of the\r\nsame week. In publishing the case, the Macon editor remarks:\r\n\r\n\"We are compelled to remark on the inefficiency of our laws in\r\nbringing to the bar of public justice, persons committing capital\r\noffences. Under the present mode, a man has nothing more to do than to\r\nleave the state, or step over to Texas, or some other place not\r\nfarther off, and he need entertain no fear of being apprehended. So\r\nlong as such a state of things is permitted to exist, just so long\r\nwill every man who has an enemy (and there are but few who have not)\r\n_be in constant danger of being shot down in the streets_.\"\r\n\r\nTo these remarks of the Macon editor, who is in the centre of the\r\nstate, near the capital, the editor of the Darien Telegraph, two\r\nhundred miles distant, responds as follows, in his paper of October\r\n30. 1838.\r\n\r\n\"The remarks of our contemporary are not without cause. They apply,\r\nwith peculiar force, to this community. _Murderers and rioters will\r\nnever stand in need of a sanctuary as long as Darien is what it is_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a coincidence which carries a comment with it, that in less than\r\na week after this Darien editor made these remarks, he was attacked in\r\nthe street by \"_fourteen_ gentlemen\" armed with bludgeons, knives,\r\ndirks, pistols, &c., and would doubtless have been butchered on the\r\nspot if he had not been rescued.\r\n\r\nWe give the following statement at length as the chief perpetrator of\r\nthe outrages, Col. W.N. Bishop, was at the time a high functionary of\r\nthe State of Georgia, and, as we learn from the Macon Messenger, still\r\nholds two public offices in the State, one of them from the direct\r\nappointment of the governor.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Georgia Messenger\" of August 25, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"During the administration of WILSON LUMPKIN, WILLIAM N. BISHOP\r\nreceived from his Excellency the appointment of Indian Agent, in the\r\nplace of William Springer. During that year (1834,) the said governor\r\ngave the command of a company of men, 40 in number, to the said W.N.\r\nBishop, to be selected by him, and armed with the muskets of the\r\nState. This band was organized for the special purpose of keeping the\r\nCherokees in subjection, and although it is a notorious fact that the\r\nCherokees in the neighborhood of Spring Place were peaceable and by no\r\nmeans refractory, the said band were kept there, and seldom made any\r\nexcursion whatever out of the county of Murray. It is also _a\r\nnotorious fact_, that the said band, from the day of their\r\norganization, never permitted a citizen of Murray county opposed to\r\nthe dominant party of Georgia, to exercise the right of suffrage at\r\nany election whatever. From that period to the last of January\r\nelection, the said band appeared at the polls with the arms of the\r\nState, rejecting every vote that \"was not of the true stripe,\" as they\r\ncalled it. That they frequently seized and dragged to the polls honest\r\ncitizens, and compelled them to vote contrary to their will.\r\n\r\n\"Such acts of arbitrary despotism were tolerated by the\r\nadministration. Appeals from the citizens of Murray county brought\r\nthem no relief--and incensed at such outrages, they determined on the\r\nfirst Monday in January last, to turn out and elect such Judges of the\r\nInferior Court and county officers, as would be above the control of\r\nBishop, that he might thereby be prevented from packing such a jury as\r\nhe chose to try him for his brutal and unconstitutional outrages on\r\ntheir rights. Accordingly on Sunday evening previous to the election,\r\nabout twenty citizens who lived a distance from the county site, came\r\nin unarmed and unprepared for battle, intending to remain in town,\r\nvote in the morning and return home. They were met by Bishop and his\r\nState band, and asked by the former 'whether they were for peace or\r\nwar.' They unanimously responded, \"we are for peace:' At that moment\r\nBishop ordered a fire, and instantly _every musket of his band was\r\ndischarged on those citizens_, 5 of whom were wounded, and others\r\nescaped with bullet holes in their clothes. Not satisfied with the\r\noutrage, _they dragged an aged man from his wagon and beat him nearly\r\nto death_.\r\n\r\n\"In this way the voters were driven from Spring Place, and before day\r\nlight the next morning, the polls were opened by order of Bishop, and\r\nsoon after sun rise they were closed; Bishop having ascertained that\r\nthe band and Schley men had all voted. A runner was then dispatched to\r\nMilledgeville, and received from Governor Schley commissions for those\r\nself-made officers of Bishop's, two of whom have since runaway, and\r\nthe rest have been called on by the citizens of the county to resign,\r\nbeing each members of Bishop's band, and doubtless runaways from other\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"After these outrages, Bishop apprehending an appeal to the judiciary\r\non the part of the injured citizens of Murray county, had a jury drawn\r\nto suit him and appointed one of his band Clerk of the Superior Court.\r\nFor these acts, the Governor and officers of the Central Bank rewarded\r\nhim with an office in the Bank of the State, since which his own jury\r\nfound _eleven true bills_ against him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Milledgeville Federal Union of May 2, 1837, we find the\r\nfollowing presentment of the Grand Jury of Union County, Georgia,\r\nwhich as it shows some relics of a moral sense, still lingering in the\r\nstate we insert.\r\n\r\nPresentment of the Grand Jury of Union Co., March term, 1837.\r\n\r\n\"We would notice, as a subject of painful interest, the appointment of\r\nWm. N. Bishop to the high and responsible office of Teller, of the\r\nCentral Bank of the State of Georgia--an institution of such magnitude\r\nas to merit and demand the most unslumbering vigilance of the freemen\r\nof this State; as a portion of whom, we feel bound to express our\r\n_indignant reprehension_ of the promotion of such a character to one\r\nof its most responsible posts--and do exceedingly regret the blindness\r\nor _depravity_ of those who can sanction such a measure.\r\n\r\n\"We request that our presentment be published in the Miners' Recorder\r\nand Federal Union.\r\n\r\nJOHN MARTIN, Foreman\"\r\n\r\nOn motion of Henry L. Sims, Solicitor General, \"Ordered by the court,\r\nthat the presentments of the Grand Jury, be published according to\r\ntheir request.\" THOMAS HENRY, Clerk.\r\n\r\nThe same paper, four weeks after publishing the preceding facts,\r\ncontained the following: we give it in detail as the wretch who\r\nenacted the tragedy was another public functionary of the state of\r\nGeorgia and acting in an official capacity.\r\n\r\n\"MURDER.--One of the most brutal and inhuman murders it has ever\r\nfallen to our lot to notice, was lately committed in Cherokee county,\r\nby Julius Bates, the son of the principal keeper of the Penitentiary,\r\nupon an Indian.\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances as detailed to us by the most respectable men of\r\nboth parties, are these. At the last Superior Court of Cass county,\r\nthe unfortunate Indian was sentenced to the Penitentiary. Bates, as\r\n_one of the Penitentiary guard_, was sent with another to carry him\r\nand others, from other counties to Milledgeville. He started from\r\nCassville with the Indian ironed and bare footed; and walked him\r\nwithin a quarter of a mile of Canton, the C.H. in Cherokee, a distance\r\nof twenty-eight to thirty miles, over a very rough road in little more\r\nthan half the day. On arriving at a small creek near town, the Indian\r\n[who had walked until the _soles of his feet were off and those of his\r\nheel turned back_,] made signs to get water, Bates refused to let him,\r\nand ordered him to go on: the Indian stopped and finally set down,\r\nwhereupon Bates dismounted and gathering a pine knot, commenced and\r\ncontinued beating him and jirking him by a chain around his neck,\r\nuntil the citizens of the village were drawn there by the severity of\r\nthe blows. The unfortunate creature was taken up to town and died in a\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\n\"An inquest was held, and the jury found a verdict of murder by Bates.\r\nA warrant was issued, but Bates had departed that morning in charge of\r\nother prisoners taken from Canton, and the worthy officers of the\r\ncounty desisted from his pursuit, 'because they apprehended he had\r\npassed the limits of the county.' We understand that the warrant was\r\nimmediately sent to the Governor to have him arrested. Will it be\r\ndone? We shall see.\"\r\n\r\nHaving devoted so much space to a revelation of the state of society\r\namong the slaveholders of Georgia, we will tax the reader's patience\r\nwith only a single illustration of the public sentiment--the degree of\r\nactual legal protection enjoyed in the state of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina was settled about two centuries ago; its present white\r\npopulation is about five hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nPassing by the murders, affrays, &c. with which the North Carolina\r\npapers abound, we insert the following as an illustration of the\r\npublic sentiment of North Carolina among 'gentlemen of property and\r\nstanding.'\r\n\r\nThe 'North Carolina Literary and Commercial Journal,' of January 20,\r\n1838, published at Elizabeth City, devotes a column and a half to a\r\ndescription of the lynching, tarring, feathering, ducking, riding on a\r\nrail, pumping, &c., of a Mr. Charles Fife, a merchant of that city,\r\nfor the crime of 'trading with negroes.' The editor informs us that\r\nthis exploit of vandalism was performed very deliberately, at mid-day,\r\nand _by a number of the citizens_, 'THE MOST RESPECTABLE IN THE CITY,'\r\n&c. We proceed to give the reader an abridgement of the editor's\r\nstatement in his own words.--\r\n\r\n\"Such being the case, a number of the citizens, THE MOST RESPECTABLE\r\nIN THIS CITY, collected, about ten days since, and after putting the\r\nfellow on a rail, carried him through town with a duck and chicken\r\ntied to him. He was taken down to the water and his head tarred and\r\nfeathered; and when they returned he was put under a pump, where for a\r\nfew minutes he underwent a little cooling. He was then told that he\r\nmust leave town by the next Saturday--if he did not he would be\r\nvisited again, and treated more in accordance with the principles of\r\nthe laws of Judge Lynch.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday last, he was again visited, and as Fife had several of\r\nhis friends to assist him, some little scuffle ensued, when several\r\nwere knocked down, but nothing serious occurred. Fife was again\r\nmounted on a rail and brought into town, but as he promised if they\r\nwould not trouble him he would leave town in a few days, he was set at\r\nliberty. Several of our magistrates _took no notice of the affair_,\r\nand rather seemed to tacitly acquiesce in the proceedings. The whole\r\nsubject every one supposed was ended, as Fife was to leave in a few\r\ndays, when WHAT WAS OUR ASTONISHMENT to hear that Mr. Charles R.\r\nKinney had visited Fife, advised him not to leave, and actually took\r\nupon himself to examine witnesses, and came before the public as the\r\ndefender of Fife. The consequence was, that all the rioters were\r\nsummoned by the Sheriff to appear in the Court House and give bail for\r\ntheir appearance at our next court. On Monday last the court opened at\r\n12 o'clock, Judge Bailey presiding. Such an excitement we never\r\nwitnessed before in our town. A great many witnesses were examined,\r\nwhich proved the character of Fife beyond a doubt. At one time rather\r\nserious consequences were apprehended--high words were spoken, and\r\nluckily a blow which was aimed at Mr. Kinney, was parried off, and we\r\nare happy to say the court adjourned after ample securities being\r\ngiven. The next day Fife was taken to jail for trading with negroes,\r\nbut has since been released on paying $100. The interference of Mr.\r\nKinney was wholly unnecessary; it was an assumption on his part which\r\nproperly belonged to our magistrates. Fife had agreed to go away, and\r\nthe matter would have been amicably settled but for him. We have no\r\nunfriendly feelings towards Mr. Kinney: no personal animosities to\r\ngratify: we have always considered him as one of our best lawyers. But\r\nwhen he comes forth as the supporter of such a fellow as Fife, under\r\nthe plea that the laws have been violated--when he arraigns the acts\r\nof thirty of the inhabitants of this place, it is high time for him to\r\nreflect seriously on the consequences. The Penitentiary system is the\r\nresult of the refinement of the eighteenth century. As man advances in\r\nthe sciences, in the arts, in the intercourse of social and civilized\r\nlife, in the same proportion does crime and vice keep an equal pace,\r\nand always makes demands on the wisdom of legislators. Now, what is\r\nthe Lynch law but the Penitentiary system carried out to its full\r\nextent, with a little more steam power? or more properly, it is simply\r\nthus: _There are some scoundrels in society on whom the laws take no\r\neffect; the most expeditious and short way is to let a majority decide\r\nand give them_ JUSTICE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the reader notice, 1st, that this outrage was perpetrated with\r\ngreat deliberation, and after it was over, the victim was commanded to\r\nleave town by the next week: when that cooling interval had passed,\r\nthe outrage was again deliberately repeated. 2d. It was perpetrated by\r\n\"thirty persons,' \"_the most respectable in the city_.\" 3d. That at\r\nthe second lynching of Fife, several of his neighbors who had gathered\r\nto defend him, (seeing that all the legal officers in the city had\r\nrefused to do it, thus violating their oaths of office,) _were knocked\r\ndown_, to which the editor adds, with the business air of a\r\nprofessional butcher, \"nothing _serious_ occurred!\" 4th. That not a\r\nsingle magistrate in the city took the least notice either of the\r\nbarbarities inflicted upon Fife, or of the assaults upon his friends,\r\nknocking them down, &c., but, as the editor informs us, all \"seemed to\r\nacquiesce in the proceedings.\" 5th. That this conduct of the\r\nmagistrates was well pleasing to the great mass of the citizens, is\r\nplain, from the remark of the editor that \"every one supposed that the\r\nwhole subject was ended,\" and from his wondering exclamation, \"WHAT\r\nWAS OUR ASTONISHMENT to hear that Mr. C.R. Kinney had actually took\r\nupon him to examine witnesses,\" &c., and also from the editor's\r\ndeclaration, \"Such an excitement we never before witnessed in our\r\ntown.\" Excitement at what? Not because the laws had been most\r\nimpiously trampled down at noon-day by a conspiracy of thirty persons,\r\n\"the most respectable in the city;\" not because a citizen had been\r\ntwice seized and publicly tortured for hours, without trial, and in\r\nutter defiance of all authority; nay, verily! this was all\r\ncomplacently acquiesced in; but because in this slaveholding Sodom\r\nthere was found a solitary Lot who dared to uplift his voice for _law_\r\nand the _right of trial by jury_; this crime stirred up such an uproar\r\nin that city of \"most respectable\" lynchers as was \"_never witnessed\r\nbefore_,\" and the noble lawyer who thus put every thing at stake in\r\ninvoking the majesty of law, would, it seems, have been knocked down,\r\neven in the presence of the Court, if the blow had not been \"parried.\"\r\n6th. Mark the murderous threat of the editor--when he arraigns the\r\n_acts_,\" (no matter how murderous) \"of thirty citizens of this place,\r\nit is high time for him to reflect seriously _on the consequences_.\"\r\n7th. The open advocacy of \"Lynch law\" by a set argument, boldly\r\nsetting it above all codes, with which the editor closes his article,\r\nreveals a public sentiment in the community which shows, that in North\r\nCarolina, though society may still rally under the flag of\r\ncivilization, and insist on wrapping itself in its folds, barbarism is\r\nnone the less so in a stolen livery, and savages are savages still,\r\nthough tricked out with the gauze and tinsel of the stars and stripes.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated, in conclusion, that the North Carolina \"Literary and\r\nCommercial Journal,\" from which the article is taken, is a large\r\nsix-columned paper, edited by F.S. Proctor, Esq., a graduate of a\r\nUniversity, and of considerable literary note in the South.\r\n\r\nHaving drawn out this topic to so great a length, we waive all\r\ncomments, and only say to the reader, in conclusion, _ponder these\r\nthings_, and lay it to heart, that slaveholding \"is justified _of her\r\nchildren_.\" Verily, they have their reward! \"With what measure ye mete\r\nwithal it shall be measured to you again.\" Those who combine to\r\ntrample on others, will trample on _each other_. The habit of\r\ntrampling upon _one_, begets a state of mind that will trample upon\r\n_all_. Accustomed to wreak their vengeance on their slaves, indulgence\r\nof passion becomes with slaveholders a second law of nature, and, when\r\nexcited even by their equals, their hot blood brooks neither restraint\r\nnor delay; _gratification_ is the _first_ thought--prudence generally\r\ncomes too late, and the slaves see their masters fall a prey to each\r\nother, the victims of those very passions which have been engendered\r\nand infuriated by the practice of arbitrary rule over _them_. Surely\r\nit need not be added, that those who thus tread down their equals,\r\nmust trample as in a wine-press their defenceless vassals. If, when in\r\npassion, they seize those who are _on their own level_, and dash them\r\nunder their feet, with what a crushing vengeance will they leap upon\r\nthose who are _always_ under their feet?\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 39: A few years since Mr. Bourne published a work entitled,\r\n\"Picture of slavery in the United States.\"  In which he describes a\r\nvariety of horrid atrocities perpetrated upon slaves; such as brutal\r\nscourging and lacerations with the application of pepper, mustard,\r\nsalt, vinegar, &c., to the bleeding gashes; also maimings,\r\ncat-haulings, burnings, and other tortures similar to hundreds\r\ndescribed on the preceeding pages. These descriptions of Mr. Bourne\r\nwere, at that time, thought by multitudes _incredible_, and probably,\r\neven by some abolitionists, who had never given much reflection to the\r\nsubject. We are happy to furnish the reader with the following\r\ntestimony of a Virginia slaveholder to the _accuracy_ of Mr. Bourne's\r\ndelineations. Especially as this slaveholder is a native of one of the\r\ncounties (Culpepper) near to which the atrocities described by Mr. B.\r\nwere committed.\r\n\r\nTestimony of Mr. WILLIAM HANSBOROUGH, of Culpepper, County, Virginia,\r\nthe \"owner\" of sixty slaves, to Mr. Bourne's \"Picture or Slavery\" as a\r\n_true_ delineation.\r\n\r\nLindley Coates, of Lancaster Co., Pa., a well known member of the\r\nSociety of Friends, and a member of the late Pennsylvania Convention\r\nfor revising, the Constitution of the State, in a letter now before\r\nus, describing a recent interview between him and Mr. Hansborough, of\r\nseveral days continuance, says,--\"I handed him Bourne's Picture of\r\nslavery to read: _after reading it_, he said, that all of the\r\nsufferings of slaves therein related, were _true delineations, and\r\nthat he had seen all those modes of torture himself_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 40: The following is Mr. Stevenson's disclaimer: It was\r\npublished in the 'London Mail,' Oct 30, 1838.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Evening Mail:_\r\n\r\nSir--I did not see until my return from Scotland the note addressed by\r\nMr. O'Connell, to the editor of the Chronicle, purporting to give an\r\nexplanation of the correspondence which has passed between us, and\r\nwhich I deemed it proper to make public. I do not intend to be drawn\r\ninto any discussion of the subject of domestic slavery as it exists in\r\nthe United States, nor to give any explanation of the motives or\r\ncircumstances under which I have acted.\r\n\r\nDisposed to regard Mr. O'Connell as a man of honor. I was induced to\r\ntake the course I did; whether justifiable or not, the world will now\r\ndecide. The tone and report of his last note (in which he disavows\r\nresponsibility for any thing he may say) precludes any further notice\r\nfrom me, than to say that the charge which he has thought proper again\r\nto repeat, of my being a breeder of slaves for sale and traffick, is\r\nwholly destitute of truth; and that I am warranted in believing it has\r\nbeen made by him without the slightest authority. SUCH, TOO, I VENTURE\r\nTO SAY, IS THE CASE IN RELATION TO HIS CHARGE OF SLAVE-BREEDING IN\r\nVIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nI make this declaration, not because I admit Mr. O'Connell's right to\r\ncall for it, but to prevent my silence from being misinterpreted.\r\n\r\nA.

There are several\r\nkinds of knives in use--a narrow blade, and about twelve inches long,\r\nis called an 'Arkansas tooth-pick.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 43: Bishop Smith of Kentucky, in his testimony respecting\r\nhomicides, which is quoted on a preceding pages, thus speaks of the\r\ninfluence of slave-holding, as an exciting cause.\r\n\r\n\"Are not some of the indirect influences of a system, the existence of\r\nwhich amongst us can never be sufficiently deplored, discoverable in\r\nthese affrays? Are not our young men more heady, violent and imperious\r\nin consequence of their early habits of command? And are not our\r\ntaverns and other public places of resort, much more crowded with an\r\ninflammable material, than if young men were brought up in the staid\r\nand frugal habits of those who are constrained to earn their bread by\r\nthe sweat of their brow? * * * Is not intemperance more social, more\r\ninflammatory, more pugnacious where a fancied superiority of\r\ngentlemanly character is felt in consequence of exemption from severe\r\nmanual labor? Is there ever stabbing where there is not idleness and\r\nstrong drink?\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop also gives the following as another exciting cause; it is\r\nhowever only the product of the preceding.\r\n\r\n\"Has not a public sentiment which we hear characterized as singularly\r\nhigh-minded and honorable, and sensitively alive to every affront,\r\nwhether real or imaginary, but which strangers denominate rough and\r\nferocious, much to do in provoking these assaults, and then in\r\napplauding instead of punishing the offender.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop says of the young men of Kentucky, that they \"grow up\r\nproud, impetuous, and reckless of all responsibility;\" and adds, that\r\nthe practice of carrying deadly weapons is with them \"NEARLY\r\nUNIVERSAL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the use of the Index, some of the more common topics are\r\narranged under one general title.

PRESIDENT--I rise to present for the consideration of the Senate,\r\nnumerous petitions signed by, not only citizens of my own State, but\r\ncitizens of several other States, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan,\r\nIllinois, and Indiana. These petitioners, amounting in number to\r\nseveral thousand, have thought proper to make me their organ, in\r\ncommunicating to Congress their opinions and wishes on subjects which,\r\nto them, appear of the highest importance. These petitions, sir, are\r\non the subject of slavery, the slave trade as carried on within and\r\nfrom this District, the slave trade between the different States of\r\nthis Confederacy, between this country and Texas, and against the\r\nadmission of that country into the Union, and also against that of any\r\nother State, whose constitution and laws recognise or permit slavery.\r\nI take this opportunity to present all these petitions together,\r\nhaving detained some of them for a considerable time in my hands, in\r\norder that as small a portion of the attention of the Senate might be\r\ntaken up on their account as would be consistent with a strict regard\r\nto the rights of the petitioners. And I now present them under the\r\nmost peculiar circumstances that have ever probably transpired in this\r\nor any other country. I present them on the heel of the petitions\r\nwhich have been presented by the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Clay]\r\nsigned by the inhabitants of this District, praying that Congress\r\nwould not receive petitions on the subject of slavery in the District,\r\nfrom any body of men or citizens, but themselves. This is something\r\nnew; it is one of the devices of the slave power, and most\r\nextraordinary in itself. These petitions I am bound in duty to\r\npresent--a duty which I cheerfully perform, for I consider it not only\r\na duty but an honor. The respectable names which these petitions bear,\r\nand being against a practice which I as deeply deprecate and deplore\r\nas they can possibly do, yet I well know the fate of these petitions;\r\nand I also know the time, place, and disadvantage under which I\r\npresent them. In availing myself of this opportunity to explain my own\r\nviews on this agitating topic, and to explain and justify the\r\ncharacter and proceedings of these petitioners, it must be obvious to\r\nall that I am surrounded with no ordinary discouragements. The strong\r\nprejudice which is evinced by the petitioners of the District, the\r\nunwillingness of the Senate to hear, the power which is arrayed\r\nagainst me on this occasion, as well as in opposition to those whose\r\nrights I am anxious to maintain; opposed by the very lions of debate\r\nin this body, who are cheered on by an applauding gallery and\r\nsurrounding interests, is enough to produce dismay in one far more\r\nable and eloquent than the _lone_ and humble individual who now\r\naddresses you.\r\n\r\nWhat, sir, can there be to induce me to appear on this public arena,\r\nopposed by such powerful odds? Nothing, sir, nothing but a strong\r\nsense of duty, and a deep conviction that the cause I advocate is\r\njust; that the petitioners whom I represent are honest, upright,\r\nintelligent and respectable citizens; men who love their country, who\r\nare anxious to promote its best interests, and who are actuated by the\r\npurest patriotism, as well as the deepest philanthropy and\r\nbenevolence. In representing such men, and in such a cause, though by\r\nthe most feeble means, one would suppose that, on the floor of the\r\nSenate of the United States, order, and a decent respect to the\r\nopinions of others, would prevail. From the causes which I have\r\nmentioned, I can hardly hope for this. I expect to proceed through\r\nscenes which ill become this hall; but nothing shall deter me from a\r\nfull and faithful discharge of my duty on this important occasion.\r\nPermit me, sir, to remind gentlemen that I have been now six years a\r\nmember of this body. I have seldom, perhaps too seldom, in the opinion\r\nof many of my constituents, pressed myself upon the notice of the\r\nSenate, and taken up their time in useless and windy debate. I\r\nquestion very much if I have occupied the time of the Senate during\r\nthe six years as some gentlemen have during six weeks, or even six\r\ndays. I hope, therefore, that I shall not be thought obtrusive, or\r\ncharged with taking up time with abolition petitions. I hope, Mr.\r\nPresident, to hear no more about agitating this slave question here.\r\nWho has began the agitation now? The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Clay.]\r\nWho has responded to that agitation, and congratulated the Senate and\r\nthe country on its results? The Senator from South Carolina, Mr.\r\n[Calhoun.] And pray, sir, under what circumstances is this agitation\r\nbegun? Let it be remembered, let us collect the facts from the records\r\non your table, that when I, as a member of this body, but a few days\r\nsince offered a resolution as the foundation of proceedings on these\r\npetitions, gentlemen, as if operated on by an electric shock, sprung\r\nfrom their seats and objected to its introduction. And when you, sir,\r\ndecided that it was the right of every member to introduce such motion\r\nor resolution as he pleased, being responsible to his constituents and\r\nthis body for the abuse of this right, gentlemen seemed to wonder that\r\nthe Senate had no power to prevent the action of one of its members in\r\ncases like this, and the poor privilege of having the resolution\r\nprinted, by order of the Senate, was denied.\r\n\r\nLet the Senator from South Carolina before me remember that, at the\r\nlast session, when he offered resolutions on the subject of slavery,\r\nthey were not only received without objection, but printed, voted on,\r\nand decided; and let the Senator from Kentucky reflect, that the\r\npetition which he offered against our right, was also received and\r\nordered to be printed without a single dissenting voice; and I call on\r\nthe Senate and the country to remember, that the resolutions which I\r\nhave offered on the same subject have not only been refused the\r\nprinting, but have been laid on the table without being debated, or\r\nreferred. Posterity, which shall read the proceedings of this time,\r\nmay well wonder what power could induce the Senate of the United\r\nStates to proceed in such a strange and contradictory manner. Permit\r\nme to tell the country now what this power behind the throne, greater\r\nthan the throne itself, is. It is the power of SLAVERY. It is a power,\r\naccording to the calculation of the Senator from Kentucky, which owns\r\ntwelve hundred millions of dollars in human beings as property; and if\r\nmoney is power, this power is not to be conceived or calculated; a\r\npower which claims human property more than double the amount which\r\nthe whole money of the world could purchase. What can stand before\r\nthis power? Truth, everlasting truth, will yet overthrow it. This\r\npower is aiming to govern the country, its constitutions and laws; but\r\nit is not certain of success, tremendous as it is, without foreign or\r\nother aid. Let it be borne in mind that the Bank power, some years\r\nsince, during what has been called the panic session, had influence\r\nsufficient in this body, and upon this floor, to prevent the reception\r\nof petitions against the action of the Senate on their resolutions of\r\ncensure against the President. The country took instant alarm, and the\r\npolitical complexion of this body was changed as soon as possible. The\r\nsame power, though double in means and in strength, is now doing the\r\nsame thing. This is the array of power that even now is attempting\r\nsuch an unwarrantable course in this country; and the people are also\r\nnow moving against the slave, as they formerly did against the Bank\r\npower. It, too, begins to tremble for its safety. What is to be done?\r\nWhy, petitions are received and ordered to be printed, against the\r\nright of petitions which are not received, and the whole power of\r\ndebate is thrown into the scale with the slaveholding power. But all\r\nwill not do; these two powers must now be united: an amalgamation of\r\nthe black power of the South with the white power of the North must\r\ntake place, as either, separately, cannot succeed in the destruction\r\nof the liberty of speech and the press, and the right of petition. Let\r\nme tell gentlemen, that both united will never succeed; as I said on a\r\nformer day, God forbid that they should ever rule this country! I have\r\nseen this billing and cooing between these different interests for\r\nsome time past; I informed my private friends of the political party\r\nwith which I have heretofore acted, during the first week of this\r\nsession, that these powers were forming a union to overthrow the\r\npresent administration; and I warned them of the folly and mischief\r\nthey were doing in their abuse of those who were opposed to slavery.\r\nAll doubts are now terminated. The display made by the Senator from\r\nKentucky, [Mr. Clay,] and his denunciations of these petitioners as\r\nabolitionists, and the hearty response and cordial embrace which his\r\nefforts met from the Senator from South Carolina, [Mr. Calhoun,]\r\nclearly shows that new moves have taken place on the political\r\nchessboard, and new coalitions are formed, new compromises and new\r\nbargains, settling and disposing of the rights of the country for the\r\nadvantage of political aspirants.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Calhoun] seemed, at the\r\nconclusion of the argument made by the Senator from Kentucky, to be\r\nfilled not only with delight but with ecstasy. He told us, that about\r\ntwelve months since HE had offered a resolution which turned the tide\r\nin favor of the great principle of State rights, and says he is highly\r\npleased with the course taken by the Kentucky Senator. All is now safe\r\nby the acts of that Senator. The South is now consolidated as one man;\r\nit was a great epoch in our history, but we have now passed it; it is\r\nthe beginning of a moral revolution; slavery, so far from being a\r\npolitical evil, is a great blessing; both races have been improved by\r\nit; and that abolition is now DEAD, and will soon be forgotten. So far\r\nthe Senator from South Carolina, as I understand him. But, sir, is\r\nthis really the case? Is the South united as one man, and is the\r\nSenator from Kentucky the great centre of attraction? What a lesson to\r\nthe friends of the present Administration, who have been throwing\r\nthemselves into the arms of the southern slave-power for support! The\r\nblack enchantment I hope is now at an end--the dream dissolved, and we\r\nawake into open day. No longer is there any uncertainty or any doubt\r\non this subject. But is the great epoch passed? is it not rather just\r\nbeginning? Is abolitionism DEAD--or is it just awaking into life? Is\r\nthe right of petition strangled and forgotten--or is it increasing in\r\nstrength and force? These are serious questions for the gentleman's\r\nconsideration, that may damp the ardor of his joy, if examined with an\r\nimpartial mind, and looked at with an unprejudiced eye. Sir, when\r\nthese paeans were sung over the death of abolitionists, and, of\r\ncourse, their right to liberty of speech and the press, at least in\r\nfancy's eye, we might have seen them lying in heaps upon heaps, like\r\nthe enemies of the strong man in days of old. But let me bring back\r\nthe gentleman's mind from this delightful scene of abolition death, to\r\nsober realities and solemn facts. I have now lying before me the names\r\nof thousands of living witnesses, that slavery has not entirely\r\nconquered liberty; that abolitionists (for so are all these\r\npetitioners called) are not _all dead_. These are my first proofs to\r\nshow the gentleman his ideas are all fancy. I have also, sir, since\r\nthe commencement of this debate, received a newspaper, as if sent by\r\nProvidence to suit the occasion, and by whom I know not. It is the\r\nCincinnati Republican of the 2d instant, which contains an extract\r\nfrom the Louisville Advertiser, a paper printed in Kentucky, in\r\nLouisville, our sister city; and though about one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles below us, it is but a few hours distant. That paper is the\r\nleading Administration journal, too, as I am informed, in Kentucky.\r\nHear what it says on the death of abolition:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ABOLITION--CINCINNATI--THE LOUISVILLE ADVERTISER.\r\n\r\n\"We copy the following notice of an article which we lately published,\r\nupon the subject of abolition movements in this quarter, from the\r\nLouisville Advertiser:--\r\n\r\n\"'ABOLITION.--The reader is referred to an interesting article which we\r\nhave copied from the Cincinnati Republican--a paper which lately\r\nsupported the principles of Democracy; a paper which has _turned_, but\r\nnot quite far enough to act with the Adamses and Slades in Congress,\r\nor the Whig abolitionists of Ohio. It does not, however, give a\r\ncorrect view of the strength of the abolitionists in Cincinnati. There\r\nthey are in the ascendant. They control the city elections, regulate\r\nwhat may be termed the morals of the city, give tone to public\r\nopinion, and \"rule the roast,\" by virtue of their superior piety and\r\nintelligence. The Republican tells us, that they are not laboring Loco\r\nFocos--but \"drones\" and \"consumers\"--the \"rich and well-born,\" of\r\ncourse; men who have leisure and means, and a disposition to employ\r\nthe latter, to equalize whites and blacks in the slaveholding States.\r\nEven now, the absconding slave is perfectly safe in Cincinnati. We\r\ndoubt whether an instance can be adduced of the recovery of a runaway\r\nin that place in the last four years. When negroes reach \"the Queen\r\ncity\" they are protected by its intelligence, its piety, and its\r\nwealth. They receive the aid of the _elite_ of the Buckeyes; and we\r\nhave a strong faction in Kentucky, struggling zealously to make her\r\none of the dependencies of Cincinnati! Let our mutual sons go on. The\r\nday of mutual retribution is at hand--much nearer than is now\r\nimagined. The Republican, which still looks with a friendly eye to the\r\nslaveholding States, warns us of the danger which exists, although its\r\nnew-born zeal for Whiggery prompts it to insist, indirectly, on the\r\nright of petitioning Congress to abolish slavery. There are about two\r\nhundred and fifty abolition societies in Ohio at the present time,\r\nand, from the circular issued at head quarters, Cincinnati, it appears\r\nthat agents are to be sent through every county to distribute books\r\nand pamphlets designed to inflame the public mind, and then organize\r\nadditional societies--or, rather, form new clans, to aid in the war\r\nwhich has been commenced on the slaveholding States.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not, sir, underwrite for the truth of this statement as an entire\r\nwhole; much of it I repel as an unjust charge on my fellow-citizens of\r\nCincinnati; but, as it comes from a slaveholding State--from the State\r\nof the Senator who has so eloquently anathematized abolitionists that\r\nit is almost a pity they could not die under such sweet sounds--and as\r\nthe South Carolina Senator pronounces them dead, I produce this from a\r\nslaveholding State, for the special benefit and consolation of the two\r\nSenators. It comes from a source to which, I am sure, both gentlemen\r\nought to give credit. But suppose, sir, that abolitionism is dead, is\r\nliberty dead also and slavery triumphant? Is liberty of speech, of the\r\npress, and the right of petition also dead? True, it has been\r\nstrangled here; but gentlemen will find themselves in great error if\r\nthey suppose it also strangled in the country; and the very attempt,\r\nin legislative bodies, to sustain a local and individual interest, to\r\nthe destruction of our rights, proves that those rights are not dead,\r\nbut a living principle, which slavery cannot extinguish; and be my lot\r\nwhat it may, I shall, to the utmost of my abilities, under all\r\ncircumstances, and at all times, contend for that freedom which is the\r\ncommon gift of the Creator to all men, and against the power of these\r\ntwo great interests--the slave power of the South, and banking power\r\nof the North--which are now uniting to rule this country. The cotton\r\nbale and the bank note have formed an alliance; the credit system with\r\nslave labor. These two congenial spirits have at last met and embraced\r\neach other, both looking to the same object--to live upon the\r\nunrequited labor of others--and have now erected for themselves a\r\ncommon platform, as was intimated during the last session, on which\r\nthey can meet, and bid defiance, as they hope, to free principles and\r\nfree labor.\r\n\r\nWith these introductory remarks, permit me, sir, to say here, and let\r\nno one pretend to misunderstand or misrepresent me, that I charge\r\ngentlemen, when they use the word abolitionists, they mean petitioners\r\nhere such as I now present--men who love liberty, and are opposed to\r\nslavery--that in behalf of these citizens I speak; and, by whatever\r\nname they may be called, it is those who are opposed to slavery whose\r\ncause I advocate. I make no war upon the rights of others. I do no act\r\nbut what is moral, constitutional, and legal, against the peculiar\r\ninstitutions of any State; but acts only in defence of my own rights,\r\nof my fellow citizens, and, above all, of my State, I shall not cease\r\nwhile the current of life shall continue to flow.\r\n\r\nI shall, Mr. President, in the further consideration of this subject,\r\nendeavor to prove, first, the right of the people to petition; second,\r\nwhy slavery is wrong, and why I am opposed to it; third, the power of\r\nslavery in this country, and its dangers; next, answer the question,\r\nso often asked, what have the free States to do with slavery? Then\r\nmake some remarks by way of answer to the arguments of the Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky, [Mr. Clay.]\r\n\r\nMr. President, the duty I am requested to perform is one of the\r\nhighest which a Representative can be called on to discharge. It is to\r\nmake known to the legislative body the will and the wishes of his\r\nconstituents and fellow-citizens; and, in the present case, I feel\r\nhonored by the confidence reposed in me, and proceed to discharge the\r\nduty. The petitioners have not trusted to my fallible judgment alone,\r\nbut have declared, in written documents, the most solemn expression of\r\ntheir will. It is true these petitions have not been sent here by the\r\nwhole people of the United States, but from a portion of them only;\r\nyet such is the justice of their claim, and the sure foundation upon\r\nwhich it rests, that no portion of the American people, until a day or\r\ntwo past, have thought it either safe or expedient to present counter\r\npetitions; and even now, when counter petitions have been presented,\r\nthey dare not justify slavery, and the selling of men and women in\r\nthis District, but content themselves with objecting to others\r\nenjoying the rights they practise, and praying Congress not to receive\r\nor hear petitions from the people of the States--a new device of slave\r\npower this, never before thought of or practiced in any country. I\r\nwould have been gratified if the inventors of this system, which\r\ndenies to others what they practise themselves, had, in their\r\npetition, attempted to justify slavery and the slave trade in the\r\nDistrict, if they believe the practice just, that their names might\r\nhave gone down to posterity. No, sir; very few yet have the moral\r\ncourage to record their names to such an avowal; and even some of\r\nthese petitioners are so squeamish on this subject, as to say that\r\nthey might, from conscientious principles, be prevented from holding\r\nslaves. Not so, sir, with the petitioners which I have the honor to\r\nrepresent; they are anxious that their sentiments and their names\r\nshould be made matter of record; they have no qualms of conscience on\r\nthis subject; they have deep convictions and a firm belief that\r\nslavery is an existing evil, incompatible with the principles of\r\npolitical liberty, at war with our system of government, and extending\r\na baleful and blasting influence over our country, withering and\r\nblighting its fairest prospects and brightest hopes. Who has said that\r\nthese petitions are unjust in principle, and on that ground ought not\r\nto be granted? Who has said that slavery is not an evil? Who has said\r\nit does not tarnish the fair fame of our country? Who has said it does\r\nnot bring dissipation and feebleness to one race, and poverty and\r\nwretchedness to another, in its train? Who has said, it is not unjust\r\nto the slave, and injurious to the happiness and best interest of the\r\nmaster? Who has said it does not break the bonds of human affection,\r\nby separating the wife from the husband, and children from their\r\nparents? In fine, who has said it is not a blot upon our country's\r\nhonor, and a deep and foul stain upon her institutions? Few, very few,\r\nperhaps none but him who lives upon its labor, regardless of its\r\nmisery; and even many whose local situations are within its\r\njurisdiction, acknowledge its injustice, and deprecate its\r\ncontinuance; while millions of freemen deplore its existence, and look\r\nforward with strong hope to its final termination. SLAVERY! a word,\r\nlike a secret idol, thought too obnoxious or sacred to be pronounced\r\nhere but by those who worship at its shrine--and should one who is not\r\nsuch worshipper happen to pronounce the word, the most disastrous\r\nconsequences are immediately predicted, the Union is to be dissolved,\r\nand the South to take care of itself.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose, Mr. President, that I feel as if engaged in a\r\nforbidden or improvident act. No such thing. I am contending with a\r\nlocal and \"_peculiar_\" interest, an interest which has already banded\r\ntogether with a force sufficient to seize upon every avenue by which a\r\npetition can enter this chamber, and exclude all without its haven. I\r\nam not now contending for the rights of the negro, rights which his\r\nCreator gave him and which his fellow-man has usurped or taken away.\r\nNo, sir! I am contending for the rights of the white person in the\r\nfree States, and am endeavoring to prevent them from being trodden\r\ndown and destroyed by that power which claims the black person as\r\n_property_. I am endeavoring to sound the alarm to my fellow-citizens\r\nthat this power, tremendous as it is, is endeavoring to unite itself\r\nwith the monied power of the country, in order to extend its dominion\r\nand perpetuate its existence. I am endeavoring to drive from the back\r\nof the _negro slave_ the politician who has seated himself there to\r\nride into office for the purpose of carrying out the object of this\r\nunholy combination. The chains of slavery are sufficiently strong,\r\nwithout being riveted anew by tinkering politicians of the free\r\nStates. I feel myself compelled into this contest, in defence of the\r\ninstitutions of my own State, the persons and firesides of her\r\ncitizens, from the insatiable grasp of the slaveholding power as being\r\nused and felt in the free States. To say that I am opposed to slavery\r\nin the abstract, are but cold and unmeaning words, if, however capable\r\nof any meaning whatever, they may fairly be construed into a love for\r\nits existence; and such I sincerely believe to be the feeling of many\r\nin the free States who use the phrase. I, sir, am not only opposed to\r\nslavery in the abstract, but also in its whole volume, in its theory\r\nas well as practice. This principle is deeply implanted within me; it\r\nhas \"grown with my growth and strengthened with my strength.\" In my\r\ninfant years I learned to hate slavery. Your fathers taught me it was\r\nwrong in their Declaration of Independence: the doctrines which they\r\npromulgated to the world, and upon the truth of which they staked the\r\nissue of the contest that made us a nation. They proclaimed \"that all\r\nmen are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\ncertain inalienable rights; that amongst these are life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness.\" These truths are solemnly declared by them.\r\nI believed then, and believe now, they are self-evident. Who can\r\nacknowledge this, and not be opposed to slavery? It is, then, because\r\nI love the principles which brought your government into existence,\r\nand which have become the corner stone of the building supporting you,\r\nsir, in that chair, and giving to myself and other Senators seats in\r\nthis body--it is because I love all this, that I hate slavery. Is it\r\nbecause I contend for the right of petition, and am opposed to\r\nslavery, that I have been denounced by many as an abolitionist? Yes;\r\nVirginia newspapers have so denounced me, and called upon the\r\nLegislature of my State to dismiss me from public confidence. Who\r\ntaught me to hate slavery, and every other oppression? _Jefferson_,\r\nthe great and the good Jefferson! Yes, _Virginia Senators_, it was\r\nyour own Jefferson, Virginia's favorite son, a man who did more for\r\nthe natural liberty of man, and the civil liberty of his country, than\r\nany man that ever lived in our country; it was him who taught me to\r\nhate slavery; it was in his school I was brought up. That Mr.\r\nJefferson was as much opposed to slavery as any man that ever lived in\r\nour country, there can be no doubt; his life and his writings\r\nabundantly prove the fact. I hold in my hand a copy, as he penned it,\r\nof the original draft of the Declaration of Independence, a part of\r\nwhich was stricken out, as he says, in compliance with the wishes of\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia. I will read it. Speaking of the wrongs\r\ndone us by the British Government, in introducing slaves among us, he\r\nsays: \"He (the British King) has waged cruel war against human nature\r\nitself, violating its most sacred right of life and liberty in the\r\npersons of a distant people, who never offended him, captivating and\r\ncarrying them into SLAVERY in another hemisphere, or to incur\r\nmiserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical\r\nwarfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the\r\nChristian King of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market\r\nwhere MEN should be BOUGHT and SOLD, he has prostituted his\r\nprerogative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or\r\nrestrain execrable commerce, and that this assemblage of horrors might\r\nwant no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very\r\npeople to rise in arms against us, and purchase that liberty of which\r\nhe has deprived them by murdering the people on whom he has also\r\nobtruded them, thus paying off former crimes committed against the\r\nliberties of one people with crimes which he urges them to commit\r\nagainst the lives of another.\" Thus far this great statesman and\r\nphilanthropist. Had his contemporaries been ruled by his opinions, the\r\ncountry had now been at rest on this exciting topic. What\r\nabolitionist, sir, has used stronger language against slavery than Mr.\r\nJefferson has done? \"Cruel war against human nature,\" \"violating its\r\nmost sacred rights,\" \"piratical warfare,\" \"opprobrium of infidel\r\npowers,\" \"a market where men should be bought and sold,\" \"execrable\r\ncommerce,\" \"assemblage of horrors,\" \"crimes committed against the\r\nliberty of the people,\" are the brands which Mr. Jefferson has burned\r\ninto the forehead of slavery and the slave trade. When, sir, have I,\r\nor any other person opposed to slavery, spoken in stronger and more\r\nopprobrious terms of slavery, than this? You have caused the bust of\r\nthis great man to be placed in the centre of your Capitol; in that\r\nconspicuous part where every visitor must see it, with its hand\r\nresting on the Declaration of Independence, engraved upon marble. Why\r\nhave you done this? Is it not mockery? Or is it to remind us\r\ncontinually of the wickedness and danger of slavery? I never pass that\r\nstatue without new and increased veneration for the man it represents,\r\nand increased repugnance and sorrow that he did not succeed in driving\r\nslavery entirely from the country. Sir, if I am an abolitionist,\r\nJefferson made me so; and I only regret that the disciple should be so\r\nfar behind the master, both in doctrine and practice. But, sir, other\r\nreasons and other causes have combined to fix and establish my\r\nprinciples in this matter, never, I trust, to be shaken. A free State\r\nwas the place of my birth; a free Territory the theatre of my juvenile\r\nactions. Ohio is my country, endeared to me by every fond\r\nrecollection. She gave me political existence, and taught me in her\r\npolitical school; and I should be worse than an unnatural son did I\r\nforget or disobey her precepts. In her Constitution it is declared,\r\n\"That all men are born equally free and independent,\" and \"that there\r\nshall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the State,\r\notherwise than for the punishment of crimes.\" Shall I stand up for\r\nslavery in any case, condemned as it is by such high authority as\r\nthis? No, never! But this is not all, Indiana, our younger Western\r\nsister, endeared to us by every social and political tie, a State\r\nformed in the same country as Ohio, from whose territory slavery was\r\nforever excluded by the ordinance of July, 1787--she too, has declared\r\nher abhorrence of slavery in more strong and empathic terms than we\r\nhave done. In her constitution, after prohibiting slavery, or\r\ninvoluntary servitude, being introduced into the State, she declares,\r\n\"But as to the holding any part of the human creation in slavery, or\r\ninvoluntary servitude, can originate only in _tyranny_ and\r\n_usurpation_, no alteration of her constitution should ever take\r\nplace, so as to introduce slavery or involuntary servitude into the\r\nState, otherwise than for the punishment of crimes whereof the party\r\nhad been duly convicted.\" Illinois and Michigan also formed their\r\nconstitutions on the same principles. After such a cloud of witnesses\r\nagainst slavery, and whose testimony is so clear and explicit, as a\r\ncitizen of Ohio, I should be recreant to every principle of honor and\r\nof justice, to be found the apologist or advocate of slavery in any\r\nState, or in any country whatever. No, I cannot be so inconsistent as\r\nto say I am opposed to slavery in the _abstract_, in its separation\r\nfrom a human being, and still lend my aid to build it up, and make it\r\nperpetual in its operation and effects upon _man_ in this or any other\r\ncountry. I also, in early life, saw a slave kneel before his master,\r\nand hold up his hands with as much apparent submission, humility, and\r\nadoration, as a man would have done before his Maker, while his master\r\nwith out-stretched rod stood over him. This, I thought, is slavery;\r\none man subjected to the will and power of another, and the laws\r\naffording him no protection, and he has to beg pardon of man, because\r\nhe has offended man, (not the laws,) as if his master were a superior\r\nand all powerful being. Yes, this is slavery, boasted American\r\nslavery, without which, it is contended even here, that the union of\r\nthese States would be dissolved in a day, yes, even in an hour!\r\nHumiliating thought, that we are bound together as States by the\r\nchains of slavery! It cannot be--the blood and the tears of slavery\r\nform no part of the cement of our Union--and it is hoped that by\r\nfalling on its bands they may never corrode and eat them asunder. We\r\nwho are opposed to and deplore the existence of slavery in our\r\ncountry, are frequently asked, both in public and private, what have\r\nyou to do with slavery? It does not exist in your State; it does not\r\ndisturb you! Ah, sir, would to God it were so--that we had nothing to\r\ndo with slavery, nothing to fear from its power, or its action within\r\nour own borders, that its name and its miseries were unknown to us.\r\nBut this is not our lot; we live upon its borders, and in hearing of\r\nits cries; yet we are unwilling to acknowledge, that if we enter its\r\nterritories and violate its laws, that we should be punished at its\r\npleasure. We do not complain of this, though it might well be\r\nconsidered just ground of complaint. It is our firesides, our rights,\r\nour privileges, the safety of our friends, as well as the sovereignty\r\nand independence of our State, that we are now called upon to protect\r\nand defend. The slave interest has at this moment the whole power of\r\nthe country in its hands. It claims the President as a Northern man\r\nwith Southern feelings, thus making the Chief Magistrate the head of\r\nan interest, or a party, and not of the country and the people at\r\nlarge. It has the cabinet of the President, three members of which are\r\nfrom the slave States, and one who wrote a book in favor of Southern\r\nslavery, but which fell dead from the press, a book which I have seen,\r\nin my own family, thrown musty upon the shelf. Here then is a decided\r\nmajority in favor of the slave interest. It has five out of nine\r\njudges of the Supreme Court; here, also, is a majority from the slave\r\nStates. It has, with the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of\r\nthe House of Representatives, and the Clerks of both Houses, the army\r\nand the navy; and the bureaus, have, I am told, about the same\r\nproportion. One would suppose that, with all this power operating in\r\nthis Government, it would be content to _permit_--yes I will use the\r\nword _permit_--it would be content to permit us, who live in the free\r\nStates, to enjoy our firesides and our homes in quietness; but this is\r\nnot the case. The slaveholders and slave laws claim that as property,\r\nwhich the free States know only as persons, a reasoning property,\r\nwhich, of its own will and mere motion, is frequently found in our\r\nStates; and upon which THING we sometimes bestow food and raiment, if\r\nit appear hungry and perishing, believing it to be a human being; this\r\nperhaps is owing to our want of vision to discover the process by\r\nwhich a man is converted into a THING. For this act of ours, which is\r\nnot prohibited by our laws, but prompted by every feeling, Christian\r\nand humane, the slaveholding power enters our territory, tramples\r\nunder foot the sovereignty of our State, violates the sanctity of\r\nprivate residence, seizes our citizens, and disregarding the authority\r\nof our laws, transports them into its own jurisdiction, casts them\r\ninto prison, confines them in fetters, and loads them with chains, for\r\npretended offences against their own laws, found by willing grand\r\njuries upon the oath (to use the language of the late Governor of\r\nOhio) of a perjured villain. Is this fancy, or is it fact, sober\r\nreality, solemn fact? Need I say all this, and much more, as now\r\nmatter of history in the case of the Rev. John B. Mahan, of Brown\r\ncounty, Ohio? Yes, it is so; but this is but the beginning--a case of\r\nequal outrage has lately occurred, if newspapers are to be relied on,\r\nin the seizure of a citizen of Ohio, without even the forms of law,\r\nand who was carried into Virginia and shamefully punished by tar and\r\nfeathers, and other disgraceful means, and rode upon a rail, according\r\nto the order of Judge Lynch, and this, only because in Ohio he was an\r\nabolitionist. Would I could stop here--but I cannot. This slave\r\ninterest or power seizes upon persons of color in our States, carries\r\nthem into States where men are property, and makes merchandize of\r\nthem, sometimes under sanction of law, but more properly by its abuse,\r\nand sometimes by mere personal force, thus disturbing our quiet and\r\nharassing our citizens. A case of this kind has lately occurred, where\r\na colored boy was seduced from Ohio into Indiana, taken from thence\r\ninto Alabama and sold as a slave; and to the honor of the slave\r\nStates, and gentlemen who administer the laws there, be it said, that\r\nmany who have thus been taken and sold by the connivance, if not\r\ndownright corruption, of citizens in the free States, have been\r\nliberated and adjudged free in the States where they have been sold,\r\nas was the case of the boy mentioned, who was sold in Alabama.\r\n\r\nSlave power is seeking to establish itself in every State, in defiance\r\nof the constitution and laws of the States within which it is\r\nprohibited. In order to secure its power beyond the reach of the\r\nStates, it claims its parentage from the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. It demands of us total silence as to its proceedings, denies\r\nto our citizens the liberty of speech and the press, and punishes them\r\nby mobs and violence for the exercise of these rights. It has sent its\r\nagents into the free States for the purpose of influencing their\r\nLegislatures to pass laws for the security of its power within such\r\nState, and for the enacting new offences and new punishments for their\r\nown citizens, so as to give additional security to its interest. It\r\ndemands to be heard in its own person in the hall of our Legislature,\r\nand mingle in debate there. Sir, in every stage of these oppressions\r\nand abuses, permit me to say, in the language of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence--and no language could be more appropriate--we have\r\npetitioned for redress in the most humble terms, and our repeated\r\npetitions have been answered by repeated injury. A power, whose\r\ncharacter is marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit\r\nto rule over a free people. In our sufferings and our wrongs we have\r\nbesought our fellow-citizens to aid us in the preservation of our\r\nconstitutional rights, but, influenced by the love of gain or\r\narbitrary power, they have sometimes disregarded all the sacred rights\r\nof man, and answered in violence, burnings, and murder. After all\r\nthese transactions, which are now of public notoriety and matter of\r\nrecord, shall we of the free States tauntingly be asked what we have\r\nto do with slavery? We should rejoice, indeed, if the evils of slavery\r\nwere removed far from us, that it could be said with truth, that we\r\nhave nothing to do with slavery. Our citizens have not entered its\r\nterritories for the purpose of obstructing its laws, nor do we wish to\r\ndo so, nor would we justify any individual in such act; yet we have\r\nbeen branded and stigmatized by its friends and advocates, both in the\r\nfree and slave States, as incendiaries, fanatics, disorganizers,\r\nenemies to our country, and as wishing to dissolve the Union. We have\r\nborne all this without complaint or resistance, and only ask to be\r\nsecure in our persons, by our own firesides, and in the free exercise\r\nof our thoughts and opinions in speaking, writing, printing and\r\npublishing on the subject of slavery, that which appears to us to be\r\njust and right; because we all know the power of truth, and that it\r\nwill ultimately prevail, in despite of all opposition. But in the\r\nexercise of all these rights, we acknowledge subjection to the laws of\r\nthe State in which we are, and our liability for their abuse. We wish\r\npeace with all men; and that the most amicable relations and free\r\nintercourse may exist between the citizens of our State and our\r\nneighboring slaveholding States; we will not enter their States,\r\neither in our proper persons, or by commissioners, legislative\r\nresolutions, or otherwise, to interfere with their slave policy or\r\nslave laws; and we shall expect from them and their citizens a like\r\nreturn, that they do not enter our territories for the purpose of\r\nviolating our laws in the punishment of our people for the exercise of\r\ntheir undoubted rights--the liberty of speech and of the press on the\r\nsubject of slavery. We ask that no man shall be seized and transported\r\nbeyond our State, in violation of our own laws, and that we shall not\r\nbe carried into and imprisoned in another State for acts done in our\r\nown. We contend that the slaveholding power is properly chargeable\r\nwith all the riots and disorders which take place on account of\r\nslavery. We can live in peace with all our sister States; if that\r\npower will be controlled by law, each can exercise and enjoy the full\r\nbenefits secured by their own laws; and this is all we ask. If we hold\r\nup slavery to the view of an impartial public as it is, and if such\r\nview creates astonishment and indignation, surely we are not to be\r\ncharged as libellers. A State institution ought to be considered the\r\npride, not the shame of the State; and if we falsify such\r\ninstitutions, the disgrace is ours, not theirs. If slavery, however,\r\nis a blemish, a blot, an eating cancer in the body politic, it is not\r\nour fault if, by holding it up, others should see in the mirror of\r\ntruth its deformity, and shrink back from the view. We have not, and\r\nwe intend not, to use any weapons against slavery, but the moral power\r\nof truth and the force of public opinion. If we enter the slave\r\nStates, and tamper with the slave contrary to law, punish us, we\r\ndeserve it; and if a slaveholder is found in a free State, and is\r\nguilty of a breach of the law there, he also ought to be punished.\r\nThese petitioners, as far as I understand them, disclaim all right to\r\nenter a slave State for the purpose of intercourse with the slave. It\r\nis the master whom they wish to address; and they ask and ought to\r\nreceive protection from the laws, as they are willing to be judged by\r\nthe laws. We invite into the arena of public discussion in our State\r\nthe slaveholder; we are willing to hear his reasons and facts in favor\r\nof slavery, or against abolitionists: we do not fear his errors while\r\nwe are ourselves free to combat them. The angry feelings which in some\r\ndegree exist between the citizens of the free and slaveholding States,\r\non account of slavery, are, in many cases, properly chargeable to\r\nthose who defend and support slavery. Attempts are almost daily making\r\nto force the execution of slave laws in the free States; at least,\r\ntheir power and principles: and no term is too reproachful to be\r\napplied to those who resist such acts, and contend for the rights\r\nsecured to every man under their own laws. We are often reminded that\r\nwe ought to take color as evidence of property in a human being. We do\r\nnot believe in such evidence, nor do we believe that a man can justly\r\nbe made property by human laws. We acknowledge, however, that a _man_,\r\nnot a _thing_ may be held to service or labor under the laws of a\r\nState, and, if he escape into another State, he ought to be delivered\r\nup on claim of the party to whom such labor or service may be due;\r\nthat this delivery ought to be in pursuance of the laws of the State\r\nwhere such person is found, and not by virtue of any act of Congress.\r\n\r\nThis brings me, Mr. President, to the consideration of the petition\r\npresented by the Senator from Kentucky, and to an examination of the\r\nviews he has presented to the Senate on this highly important subject.\r\nSir, I feel, I sensibly feel my inadequacy in entering into a\r\ncontroversy with that old and veteran Senator; but nothing high or low\r\nshall prevent me from an honest discharge of my duty here. If\r\nimperfectly done, it may be ascribed to the want of ability, not\r\nintention. If the power of my mind, and the strength of my body, were\r\nequal to the task, I would arouse every man, yes, every woman and\r\nchild in the country, to the danger which besets them, if such\r\ndoctrines and views as are presented by the Senator should ever be\r\ncarried into effect. His denunciations are against abolitionists, and\r\nunder that term are classed all those who petition Congress on the\r\nsubject of slavery. Such I understand to be his argument, and as such\r\nI shall treat it. I, in the first place, put in a broad denial to all\r\nhis general facts, charging this portion of my fellow citizens with\r\nimproper motives or dangerous designs. That their acts are lawful he\r\ndoes not pretend to deny. I called for proof to sustain his charges.\r\nNone such has been offered, and none such exists, or can be found. I\r\nrepel them as calumnies double-distilled in the alembic of slavery. I\r\ndeny them, also, in the particulars and inferences; and let us see\r\nupon what ground they rest, or by what process of reasoning they are\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nThe very first view of these petitioners against our right of petition\r\nstrikes the mind that more is intended than at first meets the eye.\r\nWhy was the committee on the District overlooked in this case, and the\r\nSenator from Kentucky made the organ of communication? Is it\r\nunderstood that anti-abolitionism is a passport to popular favor, and\r\nthat the action of this District shall present for that favor to the\r\npublic a gentleman upon this hobby? Is this petition presented as a\r\nsubject of fair legislation? Was it solicited by members of Congress,\r\nfrom citizens here, for political effect? Let the country judge. The\r\npetitioners state that no persons but themselves are authorized to\r\ninterfere with slavery in the District; that Congress are their own\r\nLegislature; and the question of slavery in the District is only\r\nbetween them and their constituted legislators; and they protest\r\nagainst all interference of others. But, sir, as if ashamed of this\r\nopen position in favor of slavery, they, in a very coy manner, say\r\nthat some of them are not slaveholders, and might be forbidden by\r\nconscience to hold slaves. There is more dictation, more political\r\nheresy, more dangerous doctrine contained in this petition, than I\r\nhave ever before seen couched together in so many words. We! Congress\r\ntheir OWN Legislature in all that concerns this District! Let those\r\nwho may put on the city livery, and legislate for them and not for his\r\nconstituents, do so; for myself, I came here with a different view,\r\nand for different purposes. I came a free man, to represent the people\r\nof Ohio; and I intend to leave this as such representative, without\r\nwearing any other livery. Why talk about executive usurpation and\r\ninfluence over the members of Congress? I have always viewed this\r\nDistrict influence as far more dangerous than that of any other power.\r\nIt has been able to extort, yes, extort from Congress, millions to pay\r\nDistrict debts, make District improvements, and in support of the\r\ncivil and criminal jurisprudence of the District. Pray, sir, what\r\nright has Congress to pay the corporate debts of the cities in the\r\nDistrict more than the Debts of the corporate cities in your State and\r\nmine? None, sir. Yet this has been done to a vast amount; and the next\r\nstep is, that we, who pay all this, shall not be permitted to petition\r\nCongress on the subject of their institutions, for, if we can be\r\nprevented in one case, we can in all possible cases. Mark, sir, how\r\nplain a tale will silence these petitioners. If slavery in the\r\nDistrict concerns only the inhabitants and Congress, so does all\r\nmunicipal regulations. Should they extend to granting lottery,\r\ngaming-houses, tippling-houses, and other places calculated to promote\r\nand encourage vice--should a representative in Congress be instructed\r\nby his constituents to use his influence, and vote against such\r\nestablishments, and the people of the District should instruct him to\r\nvote for them, which should he obey? To state the question is to\r\nanswer it; otherwise the boasted right of instruction by the\r\nconstituent body is \"mere sound,\" signifying nothing. Sir, the\r\ninhabitants of this district are subject to state legislation and\r\nstate policy; they cannot complain of this, for their condition is\r\nvoluntary; and as this city is the focus of power, of influence, and\r\nconsidered also as that of fashion, if not of folly, and as the\r\nstreams which flow from here irradiate the whole country, it is right,\r\nit is proper, that it should be subject to state policy and state\r\npower, and not used as a leaven to ferment and corrupt the whole body\r\npolitic.\r\n\r\nThe honorable Senator has said the petition, though from a city, is\r\nthe fair expression of the opinion of the District. As such I treated\r\nit, am willing to acknowledge the respectability of the petitioners\r\nand their rights, and I claim for the people of my own state equal\r\nrespectability and equal rights that the people of the District are\r\nentitled to: any peculiar rights and advantages I cannot admit.\r\n\r\nI agree with the Senator, that the proceedings on abolition petitions,\r\nheretofore, have not been the most wise and prudent course. They ought\r\nto have been referred and acted on. Such was my object, a day or two\r\nsince, when I laid on your table a resolution to refer them to a\r\ncommittee for inquiry. You did not suffer it, sir, to be printed. The\r\ncountry and posterity will judge between the people whom I represent\r\nand those who caused to be printed the petition from the city. It\r\ncannot be possible that justice can have been done in both cases. The\r\nexclusive legislation of Congress over the District is as much the act\r\nof the constituent body, as the general legislation of Congress over\r\nthe States, and to the operation of this act have the people within\r\nthe District submitted themselves. I cannot, however, join the Senator\r\nthat the majority, in refusing to receive and refer petitions, did not\r\nintend to destroy or impair the right in this particular. They\r\ncertainly have done so.\r\n\r\nThe Senator admits the abolitionists are now formidable; that\r\nsomething must be done to produce harmony. Yes, sir, do justice, and\r\nharmony will be restored. Act impartially, that justice may be done:\r\nhear petitions on both sides, if they are offered, and give righteous\r\njudgments, and your people will be satisfied. You cannot compromise\r\nthem out of their rights, nor lull them to sleep with fallacies in the\r\nshape of reports. You cannot conquer them by rebuke, nor deceive them\r\nby sophistry. Remember you cannot now turn public opinion, nor can you\r\noverthrow it. You must, and you will, abandon the high ground you have\r\ntaken, and receive petitions. The reason of the case, the argument and\r\nthe judgment of the people, are all against you. One in this cause can\r\n\"chase a thousand,\" and the voice of justice will be heard whenever\r\nyou agitate the subject. In Indiana, the right to petition has been\r\nmost nobly advocated in a protest, by a member, against some puny\r\nresolutions of the Legislature of that State to whitewash slavery.\r\nPermit me to read a paragraph, worthy an American freeman:\r\n\r\n\"But who would have thought until lately, that any would have doubted\r\nthe right to petition in a respectful manner to Congress? Who would\r\nhave believed, that Congress had any authority to refuse to consider\r\nthe petitions of the people? Such a step would overthrow the autocrat\r\nof Russia, or cost the Grand Seignior of Constantinople his head. Can\r\nit be possible, therefore, that it has been reserved for a republican\r\nGovernment, in a land boasting of its free institutions, to set the\r\nfirst precedent of this kind? Our city councils, our courts of\r\njustice, every department of Government are approached by petition,\r\nhowever unanswerable, or absurd, so that its terms are respectful.\r\nNone go away unread, or unheard. The life of every individual is a\r\nperfect illustration of the subject of petitioning. Petition is the\r\nlanguage of want, of pain, of sorrow, of man in all his sad variety of\r\nwoes, imploring relief, at the hand of some power superior to himself.\r\nPetitioning is the foundation of all government, and of all\r\nadministrations of law. Yet it has been reserved for our Congress,\r\nseconded indirectly by the vote of this Legislature, to question this\r\nright, hitherto supposed to be so old, so heaven-deeded, so undoubted,\r\nthat our fathers did not think it necessary to place a guaranty of it\r\nin the first draft of the Federal Constitution. Yet this sacred right\r\nhas been, at one blow, driven, destroyed, and trodden under the feet\r\nof slavery. The old bulwarks of our Federal and State Constitutions\r\nseem utterly to have been forgotten, which declare, 'that the freedom\r\nof speech and the press shall not be abridged, nor the right of the\r\npeople peaceably to assemble and _petition_ for the redress of their\r\ngrievances.'\"\r\n\r\nThese, sir, are the sentiments which make abolitionists formidable,\r\nand set at nought all your councils for their overthrow. The honorable\r\nSenator not only admits that abolitionists are formidable, but that\r\nthey consist of three classes. The friends of humanity and justice, or\r\nthose actuated by those principles, compose one class. These form a\r\nvery numerous class, and the acknowledgment of the Senator proves the\r\nimmutable principles upon which opposition to slavery rests. Men are\r\nopposed to it from principles of humanity and justice--men are\r\nabolitionists, he admits, on that account. We thank the Senator for\r\nteaching us that word, we intend to improve it. The next class of\r\nabolitionists, the Senator says, are so, apparently, for the purpose\r\nof advocating the right of petition. What are we to understand from\r\nthis? That the right of petition needs advocacy. Who has denied this\r\nright, or who has attempted to abridge it? The slaveholding power,\r\nthat power which avoids open discussion, and the free exercise of\r\nopinion; it is that power alone which renders the advocacy of the\r\nright of petition necessary, having seized upon all the powers of the\r\nGovernment. It is fast uniting together those opposed to its iron\r\nrule, no matter to what political party they have heretofore belonged;\r\nthey are uniting with the first class, and act from principles of\r\nhumanity and justice; and if the mists and shades of slavery were not\r\nthe atmosphere in which gentlemen were enveloped, they would see\r\nconstant and increasing numbers of our most worthy and intelligent\r\ncitizens attaching themselves to the two classes mentioned, and\r\nrallying under the banners of abolitionism. They are compelled to go\r\nthere, if the gentleman will have it so, in order to defend and\r\nperpetuate the liberties of the country. The hopes of the oppressed\r\nspring up afresh from this discussion of the gentleman. The third\r\nclass, the Senator says, are those who, to accomplish their ends, act\r\nwithout regard to consequences. To them, all the rights of property,\r\nof the States, of the Union, the Senator says, are nothing. He says\r\nthey aim at other objects than those they profess--emancipation in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. No, says the Senator, their object is _universal\r\nemancipation_, not only in the District, but in the Territories and in\r\nthe States. Their object is to set free three millions of negro\r\nslaves. Who made the Senator, in his place here, the censor of his\r\nfellow citizens? Who authorized him to charge them with other objects\r\nthan those they profess?  How long is it since the Senator himself, on\r\nthis floor, denounced slavery as an evil? What other inducements or\r\nobject had he then in view? Suppose universal emancipation to be the\r\nobject of these petitioners; is it not a noble and praiseworthy\r\nobject; worthy of the Christian, the philanthropist, the statesman,\r\nand the citizen? But the Senator says, they (the petitioners) aim to\r\nexcite one portion of the country against another. I deny, sir, this\r\ncharge, and call for the proof; it is gratuitous, uncalled for, and\r\nunjust towards my fellow citizens. This is the language of a stricken\r\nconscience, seeking for the palliation of its own acts by charging\r\nguilt upon others. It is the language of those who, failing in\r\nargument, endeavor to cast suspicion upon the character of their\r\nopponents, in order to draw public attention from themselves. It is\r\nthe language of disguise and concealment, and not that of fair and\r\nhonorable investigation, the object of which is truth. I again put in\r\na broad denial to this charge, that any portion of these petitioners,\r\nwhom I represent, seek to excite one portion of the country against\r\nanother; and without proof I cannot admit that the assertion of the\r\nhonorable Senator establishes the fact. It is but opinion, and naked\r\nassertion only. The Senator complains that the means and views of the\r\nabolitionists are not confined to securing the right of petition only;\r\nno, they resort to other means, he affirms, to the BALLOT BOX; and if\r\nthat fail, says the Senator, their next appeal will be to the bayonet.\r\nSir, no man, who is an American in feeling and in heart, but ought to\r\nrepel this charge instantly, and without any reservation whatever,\r\nthat if they fail at the ballot box they will resort to the bayonet.\r\nIf such a fratricidal course should ever be thought of in our country,\r\nit will not be by those who seek redress of wrongs, by exercising the\r\nright of petition, but by those only who deny that right to others,\r\nand seek to usurp the whole power of the Government. If the ballot box\r\nfail them, the bayonet may be their resort, as mobs and violence now\r\nare. Does the Senator believe that any portion of the honest yeomanry\r\nof the country entertain such thoughts? I hope he does not. If\r\nthoughts of this kind exist, they are to be found in the hearts of\r\naspirants to office, and their adherents, and none others. Who, sir,\r\nis making this question a political affair? Not the petitioners. It\r\nwas the slaveholding power which first made this move. I have noticed\r\nfor some time past that many of the public prints in this city, as\r\nwell as elsewhere, have been filled with essays against abolitionists\r\nfor exercising the rights of freemen.\r\n\r\nBoth political parties, however, have courted them in private and\r\ndenounced them in public, and both have equally deceived them. And who\r\nshall dare say that an abolitionist has no right to carry his\r\nprinciples to the _ballot box? Who fears the ballot box?_ The honest\r\nin heart, the lover of our country and its institutions? No, sir! It\r\nis feared by the tyrant; he who usurps power, and seizes upon the\r\nliberty of others; he, for one, fears the ballot box. Where is the\r\nslave to party in this country who is so lost to his own dignity, or\r\nso corrupted by interest or power, that he does not, or will not,\r\ncarry his principles and his judgment into the ballot box? Such an one\r\nought to have the mark of Cain in his forehead, and sent to labor\r\namong the negro slaves of the South. The honorable Senator seems\r\nanxious to take under his care the ballot box, as he has the slave\r\nsystem of the country, and direct who shall or who shall not use it\r\nfor the redress of what they deem a political grievance. Suppose the\r\npower of the Executive chair should take under its care the right of\r\nvoting, and who should proscribe any portion of our citizens who\r\nshould carry with them to the polls of election their own opinions,\r\ncreeds, and doctrines. This would at once be a deathblow to our\r\nliberties, and the remedy could only be found in revolution. There can\r\nbe no excuse or pretext for revolution while the ballot box is free.\r\nOur Government is not one of force, but of principle; its foundation\r\nrests on public opinion, and its hope is in the morality of the\r\nnation. The moral power of that of the ballot box is sufficient to\r\ncorrect all abuses. Let me, then, proclaim here, from this high arena,\r\nto the citizens not only of my own State, but to the country, to all\r\nsects and parties who are entitled to the right of suffrage, To THE\r\nBALLOT BOX! carry with you honestly your own sentiments respecting the\r\nwelfare of your country, and make them operate as effectually as you\r\ncan, through that medium, upon its policy and for its prosperity. Fear\r\nnot the frowns of power. It trembles while it denounces you. The\r\nSenator complains that the abolitionists have associated with the\r\npolitics of the country. So far as I am capable of judging, this\r\ncharge is not well founded; many politicians of the country have used\r\nabolitionists as stepping stones to mount into power; and, when there,\r\nhave turned about and traduced them. He admits that political parties\r\nare willing to unite with them any class of men, in order to carry\r\ntheir purposes. Are abolitionists, then, to blame if they pursue the\r\nsame course? It seems the Senator is willing that his party should\r\nmake use of even abolitionists; but he is not willing that\r\nabolitionists should use the same party for their purpose. This seems\r\nnot to be in accordance with that equality of rights about which we\r\nheard so much at the last session. Abolitionists have nothing to fear.\r\nIf public opinion should be for them, politicians will be around and\r\namongst them as the locusts of Egypt. The Senator seems to admit that,\r\nif the abolitionists are joined to either party, there is\r\ndanger--danger of what? That humanity and justice will prevail? that\r\nthe right of petition will be secured to ALL EQUALLY? and that the\r\nlong lost and trodden African race will be restored to their natural\r\nrights? Would the Senator regret to see this accomplished by argument,\r\npersuasion, and the force of an enlightened public opinion? I hope\r\nnot; and these petitioners ask the use of no other weapons in this\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nThese ultra-abolitionists, says the Senator, invoke the power of this\r\ngovernment to their aid. And pray, sir, what power should they invoke?\r\nHave they not the same right to approach this government as other men?\r\nIs the Senator or this body authorized to deny them any privileges\r\nsecured to other citizens? If so, let him show me the charter of his\r\npower and I will be silent. Until he can do this, I shall uphold,\r\njustify, and sustain them, as I do other citizens. The exercise of\r\npower by Congress in behalf of the slaves within this District, the\r\nSenator seems to think, no one without the District has the least\r\nclaim to ask for. It is because I reside without the District, and am\r\ncalled within it by the Constitution, that I object to the existence\r\nof slavery here. I deny the gentleman's position, then, on this point.\r\nOn this then, we are equal. The Senator, however, is at war with\r\nhimself. He contends the object of the cession by the States of\r\nVirginia and Maryland, was to establish a seat of Government _only_,\r\nand to give Congress whatever power was necessary to render the\r\nDistrict a valuable and comfortable situation for that purpose, and\r\nthat Congress have full power to do whatever is necessary for this\r\nDistrict; and if to abolish slavery be necessary, to attain the\r\nobject, Congress have power to abolish slavery in the District. I am\r\nsure I quote the gentleman substantially; and I thank him for this\r\nprecious confession in his argument; it is what I believe, and I know\r\nit is all I feel disposed to ask. If we can, then, prove that this\r\nDistrict is not as comfortable and convenient a place for the\r\ndeliberations of Congress, and the comfort of our citizens who may\r\nvisit it, while slavery exists here, as it would be without slavery,\r\nthen slavery ought to be abolished; and I trust we shall have the\r\ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky to aid us in this great national\r\nreformation. I take the Senator at his word. I agree with him that\r\nthis ought to be such a place as he has described; but I deny that it\r\nis so. And upon what facts do I rest my denial? We are a Christian\r\nnation, a moral and religious people. I speak for the free States, at\r\nleast for my own State; and what a contrast do the very streets of\r\nyour capital daily present to the Christianity and morality of the\r\nnation? A race of slaves, or at least colored persons, of every hue\r\nfrom the jet black African, in regular gradation, up to the almost\r\npure Anglo-Saxon color. During the short time official duty has called\r\nme here, I have seen the really red haired, the freckled, and the\r\nalmost white negro; and I have been astonished at the numbers of the\r\nmixed race, when compared with those of full color, and I have deeply\r\ndeplored this stain upon our national morals; and the words of Dr.\r\nChanning have, thousands of times, been impressed on my mind, that \"a\r\nslave country reeks with licentiousness.\"  How comes this amalgamation\r\nof the races? It comes from slavery. It is a disagreeable annoyance to\r\npersons who come from the free States, especially to their Christian\r\nand moral feelings. It is a great hindrance to the proper discharge of\r\ntheir duties while here. Remove slavery from this District, and this\r\nevil will disappear. We argue this circumstance alone as sufficient\r\ncause to produce that effect. But slavery presents within the District\r\nother and still more appalling scenes--scenes well calculated to\r\nawaken the deepest emotions of the human heart. The slave-trade exists\r\nhere in all its HORRORS, and unwhipt of all its crimes. In view of the\r\nvery chair which you now occupy, Mr. President, if the massy walls of\r\nthis building, did not prevent it, you could see the prison, the\r\n_pen_, the HELL, where human beings, when purchased for sale, are kept\r\nuntil a cargo can be procured for transportation to a Southern or\r\nforeign market, for I have little doubt slaves are carried to Texas\r\nfor sale, though I do not know the fact.\r\n\r\nSir, since Congress have been in session, a mournful group of these\r\nunhappy beings, some thirty or forty, were marched, as if in derision\r\nof members of Congress, in view of your Capitol, chained and manacled\r\ntogether, in open day-light, yes, in the very face of heaven itself,\r\nto be shipped at Baltimore for a foreign market. I did not witness\r\nthis cruel transaction, but speak from what I have heard and believe.\r\nIs this District, then, a fit place for our deliberations, whose\r\nfeelings are outraged with impunity with transactions like this?\r\nSuppose, sir, that mournful and degrading spectacle was at this moment\r\nexhibited under the windows of our chamber, do you think the Senate\r\ncould deliberate, could continue with that composure and attention\r\nwhich I see around me? No, sir; all your powers could not preserve\r\norder for a moment. The feelings of humanity would overcome those of\r\nregard for the peculiar institutions of the States; and though we\r\nwould be politically and legally bound not to interfere, we are not\r\nmorally bound to withhold our sympathy and our execration in\r\nwitnessing such inhuman traffic. This traffic alone, in this District,\r\nrenders it an uncomfortable and unfit place for your seat of\r\nGovernment. Sir, it is but one or two years since I saw standing at\r\nthe railroad depot, as I passed from my boarding house to this\r\nchamber, some large wagons and teams, as if waiting for freight; the\r\ncars had not then arrived. I was inquired of, when I returned to my\r\nlodgings, by my landlady, if I knew the object of those wagons which I\r\nsaw in the morning. I replied, I did not; I suppose they came and were\r\nwaiting for loading. \"Yes, for slaves,\" said she; \"and one of those\r\nwagons was filled with little boys and little girls, who had been\r\nbought up through the country, and were to be taken to a southern\r\nmarket. Ah, sir!\" continued she, \"it made my very heart ache to see\r\nthem.\" The very recital unnerved and unfitted me for thought or\r\nreflection on any other subject for some time. It is scenes like this,\r\nof which ladies of my country and my state complained in their\r\npetitions, some time since, as rendering this District unpleasant,\r\nshould they visit the capital of the nation as wives, sisters,\r\ndaughters, or friends of members of Congress. Yet, sir, these\r\nrespectable females were treated here with contemptuous sneers; they\r\nwere compared, on this floor, to the fish-women of Paris, who dipped\r\ntheir fingers in the blood of revolutionary France. Sir, if the\r\ntransaction in slaves here, which I have mentioned, could make such an\r\nimpression on the heart of a lady, a resident of the District, one who\r\nhad been used to slaves, and was probably an owner, what would be the\r\nfeelings of ladies from free states on beholding a like transaction? I\r\nwill leave every gentleman and every lady to answer for themselves. I\r\nam unable to describe it. Shall the capital of your country longer\r\nexhibit scenes so revolting to humanity, that the ladies of your\r\ncountry cannot visit it without disgust? No; wipe off the foul stain,\r\nand let it become a suitable and comfortable place for the seat of\r\nGovernment. The Senator, as if conscious that his argument on this\r\npoint had proved too much, and of course had proven the converse of\r\nwhat he wished to establish, concluded this part by saying, that if\r\nslavery is abolished, the act ought to be confined to the city alone.\r\nWe thank him for this small sprinkling of correct opinion upon this\r\narid waste of public feeling. Liberty may yet vegetate and grow even\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe Senator insists that the States of Virginia and Maryland would\r\nnever have ceded this District if they had have thought slavery would\r\never have been abolished in it. This is an old story twice told. It\r\nwas never, however, thought of, until the slave power imagined it, for\r\nits own security. Let the States ask a retrocession of the District,\r\nand I am sure the free States will rejoice to make the grant.\r\n\r\nThe Senator condemns the abolitionists for desiring that slavery\r\nshould not exist in the Territories, even in Florida. He insists that,\r\nby the treaty, the inhabitants of that country have the right to\r\nremove their EFFECTS when they please; and that, by this condition,\r\nthey have the right to retain their slaves as effects, independently\r\nof the power of Congress. I am no diplomatist, sir, but I venture to\r\ndeny the conclusion of the Senator's argument. In all our intercourse\r\nwith foreign nations, in all our treaties in which the words \"goods,\r\neffects,\" &c. are used, slaves have never been considered as included.\r\nIn all cases in which slaves are the subject matter of controversy,\r\nthey are specially named by the word \"slaves; and, if I remember\r\nrightly, it has been decided in Congress, that slaves are not property\r\nfor which a compensation shall be made when taken for public use, (or\r\nrather, slaves cannot be considered as taken for public use,) or as\r\nproperty by the enemy, when they are in the service of the United\r\nStates. If I am correct, as I believe I am, in the positions I have\r\nassumed, the gentleman can say nothing, by this part of his argument,\r\nagainst abolitionists, for asking that slavery shall not exist in\r\nFlorida.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman contends that the power to remove slaves from one State\r\nto another, for sale, is found in that part of the Constitution which\r\ngives Congress the power to regulate commerce within the States, &c.\r\nThis argument is _non sequiter_, unless the honorable Senator can\r\nfirst prove that slaves are proper articles for commerce. We say that\r\nCongress have power over slaves only as persons. The United States can\r\nprotect persons, _but cannot make them property_, and they have full\r\npower in regulating commerce, and can, in such regulations, prohibit\r\nfrom its operations every thing but property; property made so by the\r\nlaws of nature, and not by any municipal regulations. The dominion of\r\nman over things, as property, was settled by his Creator when man was\r\nfirst placed upon the earth. He was to subdue the earth, and have\r\ndominion over the fish of the sea, the fowls of the air, and over\r\nevery living thing that moveth upon the earth; every herb bearing\r\nseed, and the fruit of a tree yielding seed, was given for his use.\r\nThis is the foundation of all right in property of every description.\r\nIt is for the use of man the grant is made, and of course man cannot\r\nbe included in the grant. Every municipal regulation, then, of any\r\nState, or any of its peculiar institutions, which makes man property,\r\nis a violation of this great law of nature, and is founded in\r\nusurpation and tyranny, and is accomplished by force, fraud, or an\r\nabuse of power. It is a violation of the principles of truth and\r\njustice, in subjecting the weaker to the stronger man. In a Christian\r\nnation such property can form no just ground for commercial\r\nregulations, but ought to be strictly prohibited. I therefore believe\r\nit is the duty of Congress, by virtue of this power, to regulate\r\ncommerce, to prohibit, at once, slaves being used as articles of\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman says, the Constitution left the subject of slavery\r\nentirely to the States. To this position I assent; and, as the States\r\ncannot regulate their own commerce, but the same being the right of\r\nCongress, that body cannot make slaves an article of commerce, because\r\nslavery is left entirely to the States in which it exists; and slaves\r\nwithin those States, according to the gentleman, are excluded from the\r\npower of Congress. Can Congress, in regulating commerce among the\r\nseveral States, authorize the transportation of articles from one\r\nState, and their sale in another, which they have not power so to\r\nauthorize in any State? I cannot believe in such doctrine; and I now\r\nsolemnly protest against the power of Congress to authorize the\r\ntransportation to, and the sale in, Ohio, of any negro slave whatever,\r\nor for any possible purpose under the sun. Who is there in Ohio, or\r\nelsewhere, that will dare deny this position? If Ohio contains such a\r\nrecreant to her constitution and policy, I hope he may have the\r\nboldness to stand forth and avow it. If the States in which slavery\r\nexists love it as a household god, let them keep it there, and not\r\ncall upon us in the free States to offer incense to their idol. We do\r\nnot seek to touch it with unhallowed hands, but with pure hands,\r\nupraised in the cause of truth and suffering humanity.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman admits that, at the formation of our Government, it was\r\nfeared that slavery might eventually divide or distract our country;\r\nand, as the BALLOT BOX seems continually to haunt his imagination, he\r\nsays there is real danger of dissolution of the Union if\r\nabolitionists, as is evident they do, will carry their principles into\r\nthe BALLOT BOX. If not disunion in fact, at least in feeling, in the\r\ncountry, which is always the precursor to the clash of arms. And the\r\ngentleman further says we are taught by holy writ, \"that the race is\r\nnot to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.\" The moral of the\r\ngentleman's argument is, that truth and righteousness will prevail,\r\nthough opposed by power and influence; that abolitionists, though few\r\nin number, are greatly to be feared; one, as I have said, may chase a\r\nthousand, and two put ten thousand to flight; and, as their weapons of\r\nwarfare are not \"carnal, but mighty to the pulling down of strong\r\nholds,\" even slavery itself; and as the ballot box is the great moral\r\nlever in political action, the gentleman would exclude abolitionists\r\nentirely from its use, and for opinion's sake, deny them this high\r\nprivilege of every American citizen. Permit me, sir, to remind the\r\ngentleman of another text of holy writ. \"The wicked flee when no man\r\npursueth, but the righteous are bold as a lion.\" The Senator says that\r\nthose who have slaves, are sometimes supposed to be under too much\r\nalarm. Does this prove the application of the text I have just quoted:\r\n\"Conscience sometimes makes cowards of us all.\" The Senator appeals to\r\nabolitionists, and beseeches them to cease their efforts on the\r\nsubject of slavery, if they wish, says he, \"to exercise their\r\nbenevolence.\" What! Abolitionists benevolent! He hopes they will\r\nselect some object not so terrible. Oh, sir, he is willing they should\r\npay tithes of \"mint and rue,\" but the weighter matters of the law,\r\njudgment and mercy, he would have them entirely overlook. I ought to\r\nthank the Senator for introducing holy writ into this debate, and\r\ninform him his arguments are not the sentiments of Him, who, when on\r\nearth, went about doing good.\r\n\r\nThe Senator further entreats the clergy to desist from their efforts\r\nin behalf of abolitionism. Who authorized the Senator, as a\r\npolitician, to use his influence to point out to the clergy what they\r\nshould preach, or for what they should pray? Would the Senator dare\r\nexert his power here to bind the consciences of men? By what rule of\r\nethics, then, does he undertake to use his influence, from this high\r\nplace of power, in order to gain the same object, I am at a loss to\r\ndetermine. Sir, this movement of the Senator is far more censurable\r\nand dangerous, as an attempt to unite Church and State, than were the\r\npetitions against Sunday mails, the report in opposition to which\r\ngained for you, Mr. President, so much applause in the country. I,\r\nsir, also appeal to the clergy to maintain their rights of conscience;\r\nand if they believe slavery to be a sin, we ought to honor and respect\r\nthem for their open denunciation of it, rather than call on them to\r\ndesist, for between their conscience and their God, we have no power\r\nto interfere; we do not wish to make them political agents for any\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBut the Senator is not content to entreat the clergy alone to desist;\r\nhe calls on his countrywomen to warn them, also, to cease their\r\nefforts, and reminds them that the ink shed from the pen held in their\r\nfair fingers when writing their names to abolition petitions, may be\r\nthe cause of shedding much human blood! Sir, the language towards this\r\nclass of petitioners is very much changed of late; they formerly were\r\npronounced idlers, fanatics, old women and school misses, unworthy of\r\nrespect from intelligent and respectable men. I warned gentlemen then\r\nthat they would change their language; the blows they aimed fell\r\nharmless at the feet of those against whom they were intended to\r\ninjure. In this movement of my countrywomen I thought was plainly to\r\nbe discovered the operations of Providence, and a sure sign of the\r\nfinal triumph of _universal emancipation_. All history, both sacred\r\nand profane, both ancient and modern, bears testimony to the efficacy\r\nof female influence and power in the cause of human liberty. From the\r\ntime of the preservation, by the hands of women, of the great Jewish\r\nlaw-giver, in his infantile hours, and who was preserved for the\r\npurpose of freeing his countrymen from Egyptian bondage, has woman\r\nbeen made a powerful agent in breaking to pieces the rod of the\r\noppressor. With a pure and uncontaminated mind, her actions spring\r\nfrom the deepest recesses of the human heart. Denounce her as you\r\nwill, you cannot deter her from her duty. Pain, sickness, want,\r\npoverty and even death itself form no obstacles in her onward march.\r\nEven the tender Virgin would dress, as a martyr for the stake, as for\r\nher bridal hour, rather than make sacrifice of her purity and duty.\r\nThe eloquence of the Senate, and clash of arms, are alike powerful\r\nwhen brought in opposition to the influence of pure and virtuous\r\nwoman. The liberty of the slave seems now to be committed to her\r\ncharge, and who can doubt her final triumph? I do not.--You cannot\r\nfight against her and hope for success; and well does the Senator know\r\nthis; hence this appeal to her feelings to terrify her from that which\r\nshe believes to be her duty. It is a vain attempt.\r\n\r\nThe Senator says that it was the principles of the Constitution which\r\ncarried us through the Revolution. Surely it was; and to use the\r\nlanguage of another Senator from a slave State, on a former occasion,\r\nthese are the very principles on which the abolitionists plant\r\nthemselves. It was the principle that all men are born FREE AND EQUAL,\r\nthat nerved the arm of our fathers in their contest for independence.\r\nIt was for the natural and inherent rights of _man_ they contended. It\r\nis a libel upon the Constitution to say that its object was not\r\nliberty, but slavery, for millions of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe Senator, well fearing that all his eloquence and his arguments\r\nthus far are but chaff, when weighed in the balance against truth and\r\njustice, seems to find consolation in the idea, and says that which\r\nopposes the ulterior object of abolitionists, is that the general\r\ngovernment has no power to act on the subject of slavery, and that the\r\nConstitution or the Union would not last an hour if the power claimed\r\nwas exercised by Congress. It is slavery, then, and not liberty, that\r\nmakes us one people. To dissolve slavery, is to dissolve the Union.\r\nWhy require of us to support the Constitution by oath, if the\r\nConstitution itself is subject to the power of slavery, and not the\r\nmoral power of the country? Change the form of the oath which you\r\nadminister to Senators on taking seats here, swear them to support\r\nslavery, and according to the logic of the gentleman, the Constitution\r\nand the Union will both be safe. We hear almost daily threats of\r\ndissolving the Union, and from whence do they come? From citizens of\r\nthe free States? No! From the slave States only. Why wish to dissolve\r\nit? The reason is plain, that a new government may be formed, by which\r\nwe, as a nation, may be made a slaveholding people. No impartial\r\nobserver of passing events, can, in my humble judgment, doubt the\r\ntruth of this. The Senator thinks the abolitionists in error, if they\r\nwish the slaveholder to free his slave. He asks, why denounce him? I\r\ncannot admit the truth of the question; but I might well ask the\r\ngentleman, and the slaveholders generally, \"why are you angry at me,\r\nbecause I tell you the truth?\" It is the light of truth which the\r\nslaveholder cannot endure; a plain unvarnished tale of what slavery\r\nis, he considers a libel upon himself. The fact is, the slaveholder\r\nfeels the leprosy of slavery upon him. He is anxious to hide the\r\nodious disease from the public eye, and the ballot box and the right\r\nof petition, when used against him, he feels as sharp reproof; and\r\nbeing unwilling to renounce his errors, he tries to escape from their\r\nconsequences, by making the world believe that HE is the persecuted,\r\nand not the persecutor. Slaveholders have said here, during this very\r\nsession, \"the fact is, slavery will not bear examination.\" It is the\r\nSenator who denounces abolitionists for the exercise of their most\r\nunquestionable rights, while abolitionists condemn that only which the\r\nSenator himself will acknowledge to be wrong at all times and under\r\nall circumstances. Because he admits that if it was an original\r\nquestion whether slaves should be introduced among us, but few\r\ncitizens would be found to agree to it, and none more opposed to it\r\nthan himself. The argument is, that the evil of slavery is incurable;\r\nthat the attempt to eradicate it would commence a struggle which would\r\nexterminate one race or the other. What a lamentable picture of our\r\ngovernment, so often pronounced the best upon earth! The seeds of\r\ndisease, which were interwoven into its first existence, have now\r\nbecome so incorporated into its frame, that they cannot be extracted\r\nwithout dissolving the whole fabric; that we must endure the evil\r\nwithout hope and without complaint. Our very natures must be changed\r\nbefore we can be brought tamely to submit to this doctrine. The evil\r\nwill be remedied: and to use the language of Jefferson again, \"this\r\npeople will yet be free.\" The Senator finds consolation, however in\r\nthe midst of this existing evil, in color and caste. The black race\r\n(says he) is the strong ground of slavery in our country. Yes, it is\r\n_color_, not right and justice, that is to continue forever slavery in\r\nour country. It is prejudice against color, which is the strong ground\r\nof the slaveholder's hope. Is that prejudice founded in nature, or is\r\nit the effect of base and sordid interest? Let the mixed race which we\r\nsee here, from black to almost perfect white, springing from white\r\nfathers, answer the question. Slavery has no just foundation in color:\r\nit rests exclusively upon usurpation, tyranny, oppressive fraud, and\r\nforce. These were its parents in every age and country of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Senator says, the next or greatest difficulty to emancipation is,\r\nthe amount of property it would take from the owners. All ideas of\r\nright and wrong are confounded in these words: emancipate property,\r\nemancipate a horse, or an ox, would not only be unmeaning, but a\r\nludicrous expression. To emancipate is to set free from slavery. To\r\nemancipate, is to set free a man, not property. The Senator estimates\r\nthe number of slaves--_men_ now held in bondage--at three millions in\r\nthe United States. Is this statement made here by the same voice which\r\nwas heard in this Capitol in favor of the liberties of Greece, and for\r\nthe emancipation of our South American brethren from political\r\nthralldom? It is; and has all its fervor in favor of liberty been\r\nexhausted upon foreign countries, so as not to leave a single whisper\r\nin favor of three millions of men in our own country, now groaning\r\nunder the most galling oppression the world ever saw? No, sir. Sordid\r\ninterest rules the hour. Men are made property, and paper is made\r\nmoney, and the Senator, no doubt, sees in these two peculiar\r\ninstitutions a power which, if united, will be able to accomplish all\r\nhis wishes. He informs us that some have computed the slaves to be\r\nworth the average amount of five hundred dollars each. He will\r\nestimate within bounds at four hundred dollars each. Making the amount\r\ntwelve hundred millions of dollars' worth of slave property. I heard\r\nthis statement, Mr. President, with emotions of the deepest feeling.\r\nBy what rule of political or commercial arithmetic does the Senator\r\ncalculate the amount of property in human beings? Can it be fancy or\r\nfact, that I hear such calculation, that the people of the United\r\nStates own twelve hundred millions' (double the amount of all the\r\nspecie in the world) worth of property in human flesh! And this\r\nproperty is owned, the gentleman informs us, by all classes of\r\nsociety, forming part of all our contracts within our own country and\r\nin Europe. I should have been glad, sir, to have been spared the\r\nhearing of a declaration of this kind, especially from the high source\r\nand the place from which it emanated. But the assertion has gone forth\r\nthat we have twelve hundred millions of slave property at the South;\r\nand can any man so close his understanding here as not plainly to\r\nperceive that the power of this vast amount of property at the South\r\nis now uniting itself to the banking power of the North, in order to\r\ngovern the destinies of this country. Six hundred millions of banking\r\ncapital is to be brought into this coalition, and the slave power and\r\nthe bank power are thus to unite in order to break down the present\r\nadministration. There can be no mistake, as I believe, in this matter.\r\nThe aristocracy of the North, who, by the power of a corrupt banking\r\nsystem, and the aristocracy of the South, by the power of the slave\r\nsystem, both fattening upon the labor of others, are now about to\r\nunite in order to make the reign of each perpetual. Is there an\r\nindependent American to be found, who will become the recreant slave\r\nto such an unholy combination? Is this another compromise to barter\r\nthe liberties of the country for personal aggrandisement? \"Resistance\r\nto tyrants is obedience to God.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator further insists, \"that what the law makes property is\r\nproperty.\" This is the predicate of the gentleman; he has neither\r\nfacts nor reason to prove it; yet upon this alone does he rest the\r\nwhole case that negroes are property. I deny the predicate and the\r\nargument. Suppose the Legislature of the Senator's own State should\r\npass a law declaring his wife, his children, his friends, indeed, any\r\nwhite citizen of Kentucky, _property_, and should they be sold and\r\ntransferred as such, would the gentleman fold his arms and say, \"Yes,\r\nthey are property, for the law has made them such?\" No, sir; he would\r\ndenounce such law with more vehemence than he now denounces\r\nabolitionists, and would deny the authority of human legislation to\r\naccomplish an object so clearly beyond its power.\r\n\r\nHuman laws, I contend, cannot make human beings property, if human\r\nforce can do it. If it is competent for our legislatures to make a\r\nblack man _property_, it is competent for them to make a white man the\r\nsame; and the same objection exists to the power of the people in an\r\norganic law for their own government; they cannot make property of\r\neach other; and, in the language of the Constitution of Indiana, such\r\nan act \"can only originate in usurpation and tyranny.\" Dreadful,\r\nindeed, would be the condition of this country, if these principles\r\nshould not only be carried into the ballot box, but into the\r\npresidential chair. The idea that abolitionists ought to pay for the\r\nslaves if they are set free, and that they ought to think of this, is\r\naddressed to their fears, and not to their judgment. There is no\r\nprinciple of morality or justice that should require them or our\r\ncitizens generally to do so. To free a slave is to take from\r\nusurpation that which it has made property and given to another, and\r\nbestow it upon the rightful owner. It is not taking property from its\r\ntrue owner for public use. Men can do with their own as they please,\r\nto vary their peace if they wish, but cannot be compelled to do so.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman repeats the assertion that has been repeated a thousand\r\nand one times: that abolitionists are retarding the emancipation of\r\nthe slave, and have thrown it back fifty or a hundred years; that they\r\nhave increased the rigors of slavery, and caused the master to treat\r\nhis slave with more severity. Slavery, then, is to cease at some\r\nperiod; and because the abolitionists have said to the slaveholder,\r\n\"Now is the accepted time,\" and because he thinks this an improper\r\ninterference, and not having the abolitionists in his power, he\r\ninflicts his vengeance on his unoffending slave! The moral of this\r\nstory is, the slaveholder will exercise more cruelty because he is\r\ndesired to show mercy. I do not envy the senator the full benefit of\r\nhis argument. It is no doubt a true picture of the feelings and\r\nprinciples which slavery engenders in the breast of the master. It is\r\nin perfect keeping with the threat we almost daily hear; that if\r\npetitioners do not cease their efforts in the exercise of their\r\nconstitutional rights, others will dissolve the Union. These, however,\r\nought to be esteemed idle assertions and idle threats.\r\n\r\nThe Senator tells us that the consequences arising from the freedom of\r\nslaves, would be to reduce the wages of the white laborer. He has\r\nfurnished us with neither data nor fact upon which this opinion can\r\nrest. He, however, would draw a line, on one side of which he would\r\nplace the slave labor, and on the other side free white labor; and\r\nlooking over the whole, as a general system, both would appear on a\r\nperfect equality. I have observed, for some years past, that the\r\nsouthern slaveholder has insisted that his laborers are, in point of\r\nintegrity, morality, usefulness, and comfort, equal to the laboring\r\npopulation of the North. Thus endeavoring to raise the slave in public\r\nestimation, to an equality with the free white laborer of the North;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the northern aristocrat has, in the same\r\nmanner, viz.: by comparison, endeavored to reduce his laborers to the\r\nmoral and political condition of the slaves of the South. It is for\r\nthe free white American citizens to determine whether they will permit\r\nsuch degrading comparisons longer to exist. Already has this spirit\r\nbroken forth in denunciation of the right of universal suffrage. Will\r\nfree white laboring citizens take warning before it is too late?\r\n\r\nThe last, the great, the crying sin of abolitionists, in the eyes of\r\nthe Senator, is that they are opposed to colonization, and in favor of\r\namalgamation. It is not necessary now to enter into any of the\r\nbenefits and advantages of colonization; the Senator has pronounced it\r\nthe noblest scheme ever devised by man; he says it is powerful but\r\nharmless. I have no knowledge of any resulting benefits from the\r\nscheme to either race. I have not a doubt as to the real object\r\nintended by its founders; it did not arise from principles of humanity\r\nand benevolence towards the colored race, but a desire to remove the\r\nfree of that race beyond the United States, in order to perpetuate and\r\nmake slavery more secure.\r\n\r\nThe Senator further makes the broad charge, that abolitionists wish to\r\n_enforce_ the unnatural system of amalgamation. We deny the fact, and\r\ncall on the Senator for proof. The citizens of the free States, the\r\npetitioners against slavery, the abolitionists of the free States in\r\nfavor of amalgamation! No, sir! If you want evidence of the fact, and\r\nreasoning in support of amalgamation, you must look into the slave\r\nStates; it is there it spreads and flourishes from slave mothers, and\r\npresents all possible colors and complexions, from the jet black\r\nAfrican to the scarcely to be distinguished white person. Does any one\r\nneed proof of this fact? let him take but a few turns through the\r\nstreets of your capital, and observe those whom he shall meet, and he\r\nwill be perfectly satisfied. Amalgamation, indeed! The charge is made\r\nwith a very bad grace on the present occasion. No, sir; it is not the\r\nnegro _woman_, it is the _slave_ and the contaminating influence of\r\nslavery that is the mother of amalgamation. Does the gentleman want\r\nfacts on this subject? let him look at the colored race in the free\r\nStates; it is a rare occurrence there. A colony of blacks, some three\r\nor four hundred, were settled, some fifteen or twenty years since, in\r\nthe county of Brown, a few miles distant from my former residence in\r\nOhio, and I was told by a person living near them, a country merchant\r\nwith whom they dealt, when conversing with him on this very subject,\r\nhe informed me he knew of but one instance of a mulatto child being\r\nborn amongst them for the last fifteen years; and I venture the\r\nassertion, had this same colony been settled in a slave State, the\r\ncases of a like kind would have been far more numerous. I repeat\r\nagain, in the words of Dr. Channing, it is a slave country that reeks\r\nwith licentiousness of this kind, and for proof I refer to the\r\nopinions of Judge Harper, of North Carolina, in his defence of\r\nsouthern slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Senator, as if fearing that he had made his charge too broad, and\r\nmight fail in proof to sustain it, seems to stop short, and make the\r\ninquiry, where is the process of amalgamation to begin? He had heard\r\nof no instance of the kind against abolitionists; they (the\r\nabolitionists) would begin it with the laboring class; and if I\r\nunderstand the Senator correctly, that abolitionism, by throwing\r\ntogether the white and the black laborers, would naturally produce\r\nthis result. Sir, I regret, I deplore, that such a charge should be\r\nmade against the laboring class--that class which tills the ground;\r\nand, in obedience to the decree of their Maker, eat their bread in\r\nthe sweat of their face--that class, as Mr. Jefferson says, if God has\r\na chosen people on earth, they are those who thus labor. This charge\r\nis calculated for effect, to induce the laboring class to believe,\r\nthat if emancipation takes place, they will be, in the free States,\r\nreduced to the same condition as the colored laborer. The reverse of\r\nthat is the truth of the case. It is the slaveholder NOW, he who looks\r\nupon labor as only fit for a servile race, it is him and his kindred\r\nspirits who live upon the labor of others, endeavoring to reduce the\r\nwhite laborer to the condition of the slave. They do not yet claim him\r\nas property, but they would exclude him from all participation in the\r\npublic affairs of the country. It is further said, that if the negroes\r\nwere free, the black would rival the white laborer in the free States.\r\nI cannot believe it, while so many facts exist to prove the contrary.\r\nNegroes, like the white race, but with stronger feelings, are attached\r\nto the place of their birth, and the home of their youth; and the\r\nclimate of the South is congenial to their natures, more than that of\r\nthe North. If emancipation should take place at the South--and the\r\nnegro be freed from the fear of being made merchandize, they would\r\nremove from the free States of the North and West, immediately return\r\nto that country, because it is the home of their friends and fathers.\r\nAlready in Ohio, as far as my knowledge extends, has free white labor,\r\n(emigrants,) from foreign countries, engrossed almost entirely all\r\nsituations in which male or female labor is found. But, sir, this plea\r\nof necessity and convenience is the plea of tyrants. Has not the free\r\nblack person the same right to the use of his hands as the white\r\nperson: the same right to contract and labor for what price he\r\npleases? Would the gentleman extend the power of the government to the\r\nregulation of the productive industry of the country? This was his\r\nformer theory, but put down effectually by the public voice. Taking\r\nadvantage of the prejudice against labor, the attempt is now being\r\nmade to begin this same system, by first operating on the poor black\r\nlaborer. For shame! let us cease from attempts of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe Senator informs us that the question was asked fifty years ago\r\nthat is now asked, Can the negro be continued forever in bondage? Yes;\r\nand it will continue to be asked, in still louder and louder tones.\r\nBut, says the Senator, we are yet a prosperous and happy nation. Pray,\r\nsir, in what part of your country do you find this prosperity and\r\nhappiness? In the slave States? No! no! There all is weakness gloom,\r\nand despair; while, in the free States, all is light, business, and\r\nactivity. What has created the astonishing difference between the\r\ngentleman's State and mine--between Kentucky and Ohio? Slavery, the\r\nwithering curse of slavery, is upon Kentucky, while Ohio is free.\r\nKentucky, the garden of the West, almost the land of promise,\r\npossessing all the natural advantages, and more than is possessed by\r\nOhio, is vastly behind in population and wealth. Sir, I can see from\r\nthe windows of my upper chamber, in the city of Cincinnati, lands in\r\nKentucky, which, I am told, can be purchased from ten to fifty dollars\r\nper acre; while lands of the same quality, under the same\r\nimprovements, and the same distance from me in Ohio, would probably\r\nsell from one to five hundred dollars per acre. I was told by a\r\nfriend, a few days before I left home, who had formerly resided in the\r\ncounty of Bourbon, Kentucky--a most excellent county of lands\r\nadjoining, I believe, the county in which the Senator resides--that\r\nthe white population of that county was more than four hundred less\r\nthan it was five years since. Will the Senator contend, after a\r\nknowledge of these facts, that slavery in this country has been the\r\ncause of our prosperity and happiness? No, he cannot. It is because\r\nslavery has been excluded and driven from a large proportion of our\r\ncountry, that we are a prosperous and happy people. But its late\r\nattempts to force its influence and power into the free States, and\r\ndeprive our citizens of their unquestionable rights, has been the\r\nmoving cause of all the riots, burnings, and murders that have taken\r\nplace on account of abolitionism; and it has, in some degree, even in\r\nthe free States, caused mourning, lamentation, and woe. Remove\r\nslavery, and the country, the whole country, will recover its natural\r\nvigor, and our peace and future prosperity will be placed on a more\r\nextensive, safe, and sure foundation. It is a waste of time to answer\r\nthe allegations that the emancipation of the negro race would induce\r\nthem to make war on the white race. Every fact in the history of\r\nemancipation proves the reverse; and he that will not believe those\r\nfacts, has darkened his own understanding, that the light of reason\r\ncan make no impression: he appeals to interest, not to truth, for\r\ninformation on this subject. We do not fear his errors, while we are\r\nleft free to combat them. The Senator implores us to cease all\r\ncommotion on this subject. Are we to surrender all our rights and\r\nprivileges, all the official stations of the country, into the hands\r\nof the slaveholding power, without a single struggle? Are we to cease\r\nall exertions for our own safety, and submit in quiet to the rule of\r\nthis power? Is the calm of despotism to reign over this land, and the\r\nvoice of freemen to be no more heard! This sacrifice is required of\r\nus, in order to sustain slavery. _Freemen_, will you make it? Will you\r\nshut your ears and your sympathies, and withhold from the poor,\r\nfamished slave, a morsel of bread? Can you thus act, and expect the\r\nblessings of heaven upon your country? I beseech you to consider for\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have been compelled to enter into this discussion\r\nfrom the course pursued by the Senate on the resolutions I submitted a\r\nfew days since. The cry of abolitionist has been raised against me. If\r\nthose resolutions are abolitionism, then I am an abolitionist from the\r\nsole of my feet to the crown of my head. If to maintain the rights of\r\nthe States, the security of the citizen from violence and outrage; if\r\nto preserve the supremacy of the laws; if insisting on the right of\r\npetition, a medium through which _every person_ subject to the laws\r\nhas an undoubted right to approach the constitutional authorities of\r\nthe country, be the doctrines of abolitionists, it finds a response in\r\nevery beating pulse in my veins. Neither power, nor favor, nor want,\r\nnor misery, shall deter me from its support while the vital current\r\ncontinues to flow.\r\n\r\nCondemned at home for my opposition to slavery, alone and singlehanded\r\nhere, well may I feel tremor and emotion in bearding this lion of\r\nslavery in his very _den_ and upon his own ground. I should shrink,\r\nsir, at once, from this fearful and unequal contest, was I not\r\nthoroughly convinced that I am sustained by the power of truth and the\r\nbest interests of the country.\r\n\r\nI listened to the Senator of Kentucky with undivided attention. I was\r\ndisappointed, sadly disappointed. I had heard of the Senator's tact in\r\nmaking compromises and agreements on this floor, and though opposed in\r\nprinciple to all such proceedings, yet I hoped to hear something upon\r\nwhich we could hang a hope that peace would be restored to the borders\r\nof our own States, and all future aggression upon our citizens from\r\nthe free States be prevented. Now, sir, he offers us nothing but\r\nunconditional submission to political death; and not political alone,\r\nbut absolute _death_. We have counted the cost in this matter, and are\r\ndetermined to live or die free. Let the slaveholder hug his system to\r\nhis bosom in his own State, we will not go there to disturb him; but,\r\nsir, within our own borders we claim to enjoy the same privileges.\r\nEven, sir, here in this District, this ten miles square of common\r\nproperty and common right, the slave power has the assurance to come\r\ninto this very Hall, and request that we--yes, Mr. President, that my\r\nconstituents--be denied the right of petition on the subject of\r\nslavery in this District. This most extraordinary petition against the\r\nright of others to petition on the same subject of theirs, is\r\ngraciously received and ordered to be printed; paeans sung to it by the\r\nslave power, while the petitions I offer, from as honorable, free,\r\nhigh-minded and patriotic American citizens as any in this District,\r\nare spit upon, and turned out of doors as an _unclean thing_! Genius\r\nof liberty! how long will you sleep under this iron power of\r\noppression? Not content with ruling over their own slaves, they claim\r\nthe power to instruct Congress on the question of receiving petitions;\r\nand yet we are tauntingly and sneeringly told that we have nothing to\r\ndo with the existence of slavery in the country, a suggestion as\r\nabsurd as it is ridiculous. We are called upon to make laws in favor\r\nof slavery in the District, but it is denied that we can make laws\r\nagainst it; and at last the right of petition on the subject, by the\r\npeople of the free States, is complained of as an improper\r\ninterference. I leave it to the Senator to reconcile all these\r\ndifficulties, absurdities, claims and requests of the people of this\r\nDistrict, to the country at large; and I venture the opinion that he\r\nwill find as much difficulty in producing the belief that he is\r\ncorrect now, that he has found in obtaining the same belief that he\r\nwas before correct in his views and political course on the subject of\r\nbanks, internal improvements, protective tariffs, &c., and the\r\nregulation, by acts of Congress, of the productive industry of the\r\ncountry, together with all the compromises and coalitions he has\r\nentered into for the attainment of those objects. I rejoice, however,\r\nthat the Senator has made the display he has on this occasion. It is a\r\npowerful shake to awaken the sleeping energies of liberty, and his\r\nvoice, like a trumpet, will call from their slumbers millions of\r\nfreemen to defend their rights; and the overthrow of his theory now,\r\nis as sure and certain, by the force of public opinion, as was the\r\noverthrow of all his former schemes, by the same mighty power.\r\n\r\nI feel, Mr. President, as if I had wearied your patience, while I am\r\nsure my own bodily powers admonish me to close; but I cannot do so\r\nwithout again reminding my constituents of the greetings that have\r\ntaken place on the consummation and ratification of the treaty,\r\noffensive and defensive, between the slaveholding and bank powers, in\r\norder to carry on a war against the liberties of our country, and to\r\nput down the present administration. Yes, there is no voice heard from\r\nNew England now. Boston and Faneuil Hall are silent as death. The free\r\nday-laborer is, in prospect, reduced to the political, if not moral\r\ncondition of the slave; an ideal line is to divide them in their\r\nlabor; yes, the same principle is to govern on both sides. Even the\r\nfarmer, too, will soon be brought into the same fold. It will be again\r\nsaid, with regard to the government of the country, \"The farmer with\r\nhis huge paws upon the statute book, what can he do?\" I have\r\nendeavored to warn my fellow-citizens of the present and approaching\r\ndanger, but the dark cloud of slavery is before their eyes, and\r\nprevents many of them from seeing the condition of things as they are.\r\nThat cloud, like the cloud of summer, will soon pass away, and its\r\nthunders cease to be heard. Slavery will come to an end, and the\r\nsunshine of prosperity warm, invigorate and bless our whole country.\r\n\r\nI do not know, Mr. President, that my voice will ever again be heard\r\non this floor. I now willingly, yes, gladly, return to my\r\nconstituents, to the people of my own State. I have spent my life\r\namongst them, and the greater portion of it in their service, and they\r\nhave bestowed upon me their confidence in numerous instances. I feel\r\nperfectly conscious that, in the discharge of every trust which they\r\nhave committed to me, I have, to the best of my abilities, acted\r\nsolely with a view to the general good, not suffering myself to be\r\ninfluenced by any particular or private interest whatever; and I now\r\nchallenge those who think I have done otherwise, to lay their finger\r\nupon any public act of mine, and prove to the country its injustice or\r\nanti-republican tendency. That I have often erred in the selection of\r\nmeans to accomplish important ends I have no doubt, but my belief in\r\nthe truth of the doctrines of the Declaration of Independence, the\r\npolitical creed of President Jefferson, remains unshaken and\r\nunsubdued. My greatest regret is that I have not been more zealous,\r\nand done more for the cause of individual and political liberty than I\r\nhave done. I hope, on returning to my home and my friends, to join\r\nthem again in rekindling the beacon-fires of liberty upon every hill\r\nin our State, until their broad glare shall enlighten every valley,\r\nand the song of triumph will soon be heard, for the hearts of our\r\npeople are in the hands of a just and holy being, (who can not look\r\nupon oppression but with abhorrence.) and he can turn them\r\nwhithersoever he will, as the rivers of water are turned. Though our\r\nnational sins are many and grievous, yet repentance, like that of\r\nancient Nineveh, may divert from us that impending danger which seems\r\nto hang over our heads as by a single hair. That all may be safe, I\r\nconclude that THE NEGRO WILL YET BE SET FREE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nANTI-SLAVERY EXAMINER.\r\n\r\nNo. 11.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRO-SLAVERY COMPACT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS\r\n\r\nFROM\r\n\r\nTHE MADISON PAPERS, &c.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNEW YORK:\r\n\r\nAMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n142 NASSAU STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction.\r\nDebates in the Congress of the Confederation\r\nDebates in the Federal Convention\r\nList of Members of the Federal Convention\r\nSpeech of Luther Martin\r\n\r\n  DEBATES IN STATE CONVENTIONS\r\nMassachusetts\r\nNew York\r\nPennsylvania\r\nVirginia\r\nNorth Carolina\r\nSouth Carolina\r\nExtracts from the Federalist\r\nDebates in First Congress\r\nAddress of the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society\r\nLetter from Francis Jackson to Gov.

Adams's Address, November, 1844\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that the \"Madison papers\" contain a Report, from the\r\npen of James Madison, of the Debates in the Old Congress of the\r\nConfederation and in the Convention which formed the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. We have extracted from them, in these pages, all\r\nthe Debates on those clauses of the Constitution which relate to\r\nslavery. To these we have added all that is found, on the same topic,\r\nin the Debates of the several State Conventions which ratified the\r\nConstitution: together with so much of the Speech of Luther Martin\r\nbefore the Legislature of Maryland, and of the Federalist, as relate\r\nto our subject; with some extracts, also, from the Debates of the\r\nfirst Federal Congress on Slavery. These are all printed without\r\nalteration, except that, in some instances, we have inserted in\r\nbrackets, after the name of a speaker, the name of the State from\r\nwhich he came. The notes and italics are those of the original, but\r\nthe editor has added one note on page 30th, which is marked as his,\r\nand we have taken the liberty of printing in capitals one sentiment of\r\nRufus King's, and two of James Madison's--a distinction which the\r\nimportance of the statements seemed to demand--otherwise we have\r\nreprinted exactly from the originals.\r\n\r\nThese extracts develope most clearly all the details of that\r\n\"compromise,\" which was made between freedom and slavery, in 1787;\r\ngranting to the slaveholder distinct privileges and protection for his\r\nslave property, in return for certain commercial concessions on his\r\npart toward the North. They prove also that the Nation at large were\r\nfully aware of this bargain at the time, and entered into it willingly\r\nand with open eyes.\r\n\r\nWe have added the late \"Address of the American Anti-Slavery Society,\"\r\nand the letter of Francis Jackson to Governor Briggs, resigning his\r\ncommission of Justice of the Peace--as bold and honorable protests\r\nagainst the guilt and infamy of this National bargain, and as proving\r\nmost clearly the duty of each individual to trample it under his feet.\r\n\r\nThe clauses of the Constitution to which we refer as of a pro-slavery\r\ncharacter are the following:--\r\n\r\nArt. 1, Sect. 2. Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned\r\namong the several States, which may be included within this Union,\r\naccording to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by\r\nadding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to\r\nservice for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, _three\r\nfifths of all other persons_.\r\n\r\nArt. 1, Sect. 8. Congress shall have power . . . to suppress\r\ninsurrections.\r\n\r\nArt. 1, Sect. 9. The migration or importation of such persons as any\r\nof the States now existing, shall think proper to admit, shall not be\r\nprohibited by the Congress, prior to the year one thousand eight\r\nhundred and eight: but a tax or duty may be imposed on such\r\nimportation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\r\n\r\nArt. 4. Sec. 2. No person, held to service or labor in one State,\r\nunder the laws thereof, escaping, into another, shall, in consequence\r\nof any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or\r\nlabor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\r\nservice or labor may be due.\r\n\r\nArt. 4, Sect. 4. The United States shall guarantee to every State in\r\nthis Union a republican form of government; and shall protect each of\r\nthem against invasion; and, on application of the legislature, or of\r\nthe executive, (when the legislature cannot be convened) _against\r\ndomestic violence_.\r\n\r\nThe first of these clauses, relating to representation, confers on a\r\nslaveholding community additional political power for every slave held\r\namong them, and thus tempts them to continue to uphold the system: the\r\nsecond and the last, relating to insurrection and domestic violence,\r\nperfectly innocent in themselves--yet being made with the fact\r\ndirectly in view that slavery exists among us, do deliberately pledge\r\nthe whole national force against the unhappy slave if he imitate our\r\nfathers and resist oppression--thus making us partners in the guilt of\r\nsustaining slavery: the third, relating to the slave trade, disgraces\r\nthe nation by a pledge not to abolish that traffic till after twenty\r\nyears, _without obliging Congress to do so even then_, and thus the\r\nslave trade may be legalized to-morrow if Congress choose: the fourth\r\nis a promise on the part of the whole Nation to return fugitive slaves\r\nto their masters, a deed which God's law expressly condemns and which\r\nevery noble feeling of our nature repudiates with loathing and\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nThese are the articles of the \"Compromise,\" so much talked of, between\r\nthe North and South.\r\n\r\nWe do not produce the extracts which make up these pages to show what\r\nis the meaning of the clauses above cited. For no man or party, of any\r\nauthority in such matters, has ever pretended to doubt to what subject\r\nthey all relate. If indeed they were ambiguous in their terms, a\r\nresort to the history of those times would set the matter at rest for\r\never. A few persons, to be sure, of late years, to serve the purposes\r\nof a party, have tried to prove that the Constitution makes no\r\ncompromise with slavery. Notwithstanding the clear light of\r\nhistory;--the unanimous decision of all the courts in the land,\r\nboth State and Federal;--the action of Congress and the State\r\nLegislature;--the constant practice of the Executive in all its\r\nbranches;--and the deliberate acquiescence of the whole people for\r\nhalf a century, still they contend that the Nation does not know its\r\nown meaning, and that the Constitution does not tolerate slavery!\r\nEvery candid mind however must acknowledge that the language of the\r\nConstitution is clear and explicit.\r\n\r\nIts terms are so broad, it is said, that they include many others\r\nbeside slaves, and hence it is wisely (!) inferred that they cannot\r\ninclude the slaves themselves! Many persons beside slaves in this\r\ncountry doubtless are \"held to service and labor under the laws of the\r\nStates,\" but that does not at all show that slaves are not \"held to\r\nservice;\" many persons beside the slaves may take part \"in\r\ninsurrections,\" but that does not prove that when the slaves rise, the\r\nNational government is not bound to put them down by force. Such a\r\nthing has been heard of before as one description including a great\r\nvariety of persons,--and this is the case in the present instance.\r\n\r\nBut granting that the terms of the Constitution are ambiguous--that\r\nthey are susceptible of two meanings, if the unanimous, concurrent,\r\nunbroken practice of every department of the Government, judicial,\r\nlegislative, and executive, and the acquiescence of the whole people\r\nfor fifty years do not prove which is the true construction, then how\r\nand where can such a question ever be settled? If the people and the\r\nCourts of the land do not know what they themselves mean, who has\r\nauthority to settle their meaning for them?\r\n\r\nIf then the people and the Courts of a country are to be allowed to\r\ndetermine what their own laws mean, it follows that at this time and\r\nfor the last half century, the Constitution of the United States, has\r\nbeen, and still is, a pro-slavery instrument, and that any one who\r\nswears to support it, swears to do pro-slavery acts, and violates his\r\nduty both as a man and an abolitionist. What the Constitution may\r\nbecome a century hence, we know not; we speak of it _as it is_, and\r\nrepudiate it _as it is_.\r\n\r\nBut the purpose, for which we have thrown these pages before the\r\ncommunity, is this. Some men, finding the nation unanimously deciding\r\nthat the Constitution tolerates slavery, have tried to prove that this\r\nfalse construction, as they think it, has been foisted in upon the\r\ninstrument by the corrupting influence of slavery itself, tainting all\r\nit touches. They assert that the known anti-slavery spirit of\r\nrevolutionary times never _could_ have consented to so infamous a\r\nbargain as the Constitution is represented to be, and has in its\r\npresent hands become. Now these pages prove the melancholy fact that\r\nwillingly, with deliberate purpose, our fathers bartered honesty for\r\ngain and became partners with tyrants that they might share in the\r\nprofits of their tyranny.\r\n\r\nAnd in view of this fact, will it not require a very strong argument\r\nto make any candid man believe, that the bargain which the fathers\r\ntell us they meant to incorporate into the Constitution, and which the\r\nsons have always thought they found there incorporated, does not exist\r\nthere after all? Forty of the shrewdest men and lawyers in the land\r\nassemble to make a bargain, among other things, about slaves,--after\r\nmonths of anxious deliberation they put it into writing and sign their\r\nnames to the instrument,--fifty years roll away, twenty millions at\r\nleast of their children pass over the stage of life,--courts sit and\r\npass judgment,--parties arise and struggle fiercely; still all concur\r\nin finding in the Instrument just that meaning which the fathers tell\r\nus they intended to express:--must not he be a desperate man, who,\r\nafter all this, sets out to prove that the fathers were bunglers and\r\nthe sons fools, and that slavery is not referred to at all?\r\n\r\nBesides, the advocates of this new theory of the Anti-slavery\r\ncharacter of the Constitution, quote some portions of the Madison\r\nPapers in support of their views,--and this makes it proper that the\r\ncommunity should hear all that these Debates have to say on the\r\nsubject. The further we explore them, the clearer becomes the fact\r\nthat the Constitution was meant to be, what it has always been\r\nesteemed, a compromise between slavery and freedom.\r\n\r\nIf then the Constitution be, what these Debates show that our fathers\r\nintended to make it, and what, too, their descendants, this nation,\r\nsay they did make it and agree to uphold,--then we affirm that it is a\r\n\"covenant with death and an agreement with hell,\" and ought to be\r\nimmediately annulled.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the contrary, our fathers failed in their purpose, and the\r\nConstitution is all pure and untouched by slavery,--then, Union itself\r\nis impossible, without guilt. For it is undeniable that the fifty\r\nyears passed under this (anti-slavery) Constitution, shew us the\r\nslaves trebling in numbers;--slaveholders monopolizing the offices and\r\ndictating the policy of the Government;--prostituting the strength and\r\ninfluence of the Nation to the support of slavery here and\r\nelsewhere;--trampling on the rights of the free States and making the\r\ncourts of the country their tools. To continue this disastrous\r\nalliance longer is madness. The trial of fifty years with the best of\r\nmen and the best of Constitutions, on this supposition, only proves\r\nthat it is impossible for free and slave States to unite on any terms,\r\nwithout all becoming partners in the guilt and responsible for the\r\nsin of slavery. We dare not prolong the experiment, and with double\r\nearnestness we repeat our demand upon every honest man to join in the\r\noutcry of the American Anti-Slavery Society,\r\n\r\nNO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nA PRO-SLAVERY COMPACT.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_Extracts from Debates in the Congress of Confederation, preserved by\r\nThomas Jefferson, 1776_.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the twelfth of July, 1776, the committee appointed to draw\r\nthe articles of Confederation reported them, and on the twenty-second,\r\nthe House resolved themselves into a committee to take them into\r\nconsideration. On the thirtieth and thirty-first of that month, and\r\nthe first of the ensuing, those articles were debated which determined\r\nthe proportion or quota of money which each State should furnish to\r\nthe common treasury, and the manner of voting in Congress. The first\r\nof these articles was expressed in the original draught in these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\"Article 11. All charges of war and all other expenses that shall be\r\nincurred for the common defence, or general welfare, and allowed by\r\nthe United States assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common\r\ntreasury, which shall be supplied by the several colonies in\r\nproportion to the number of inhabitants of every age, sex and quality,\r\nexcept Indians not paying taxes, in each colony, a true account of\r\nwhich, distinguishing the white inhabitants, shall be triennially\r\ntaken and transmitted to the assembly of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chase (of Maryland) moved, that the quotas should be paid, not by\r\nthe number of inhabitants of every condition but by that of the \"white\r\ninhabitants.\" He admitted that taxation should be always in proportion\r\nto property; that this was in theory the true rule, but that from a\r\nvariety of difficulties it was a rule which could never be adopted in\r\npractice. The value of the property in every State could never be\r\nestimated justly and equally. Some other measure for the wealth of the\r\nState must therefore be devised, some standard referred to which would\r\nbe more simple. He considered the number of inhabitants as a tolerably\r\ngood criterion of property, and that this might always be obtained. He\r\ntherefore thought it the best mode we could adopt, with one exception\r\nonly. He observed that negroes are property, and as such cannot be\r\ndistinguished from the lands or personalities held in those States\r\nwhere there are few slaves. That the surplus of profit which a\r\nNorthern farmer is able to lay by, he invests in cattle, horses, &c.;\r\nwhereas, a Southern farmer lays out that same surplus in slaves. There\r\nis no more reason therefore for taxing the Southern States on the\r\nfarmer's head and on his slave's head, than the Northern ones on their\r\nfarmer's heads and the heads of their cattle. That the method proposed\r\nwould therefore tax the Southern States according to their numbers and\r\ntheir wealth conjunctly, while the Northern would be taxed on numbers\r\nonly: that negroes in fact should not be considered as members of the\r\nState, more than cattle, and that they have no more interest in it.\r\n\r\nMr. John Adams (of Massachusetts) observed, that the numbers of people\r\nwere taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the State, and\r\nnot as subjects of taxation. That as to this matter, it was of no\r\nconsequence by what name you called your people, whether by that of\r\nfreemen or of slaves. That in some countries the laboring poor were\r\ncalled freemen, in others they were called slaves: but that the\r\ndifference as to the state was imaginary only. What matters it whether\r\na landlord employing ten laborers on his farm gives them annually as\r\nmuch money as will buy them the necessaries of life, or gives them\r\nthose necessaries at short hand? The ten laborers add as much wealth,\r\nannually to the State, increase its exports as much, in the one case\r\nas the other. Certainly five hundred freemen produce no more profits,\r\nno greater surplus for the payment of taxes, than five hundred slaves.\r\nTherefore the State in which are the laborers called freemen, should\r\nbe taxed no more than that in which are those called slaves. Suppose,\r\nby any extraordinary operation of nature or of law, one half the\r\nlaborers of a State could in the course of one night be transformed\r\ninto slaves,--would the State be made the poorer, or the less able to\r\npay taxes? That the condition of the laboring poor in most\r\ncountries,--that of the fishermen, particularly, of the Northern\r\nStates,--is as abject as that of slaves. It is the number of laborers\r\nwhich produces the surplus for taxation; and numbers, therefore,\r\nindiscriminately, are the fair index of wealth. That it is the use of\r\nthe word \"property\" here, and its application to some of the people of\r\nthe State, which produces the fallacy. How does the Southern farmer\r\nprocure slaves? Either by importation or by purchase from his\r\nneighbor. If he imports a slave, he adds one to the number of laborers\r\nin his country, and proportionably to its profits and abilities to pay\r\ntaxes; if he buys from his neighbor, it is only a transfer of a\r\nlaborer from one firm to another, which does not change the annual\r\nproduce of the State, and therefore should not change its tax; that if\r\na Northern farmer works ten laborers on his farm, he can, it is true,\r\ninvest the surplus of ten men's labor in cattle; but so may the\r\nSouthern farmer working ten slaves. That a State of one hundred\r\nthousand freemen can maintain no more cattle than one of one hundred\r\nthousand slaves; therefore they have no more of that kind of property.\r\nThat a slave may, indeed, from the custom of speech, be more properly\r\ncalled the wealth of his master, than the free laborer might be called\r\nthe wealth of his employer: but as to the State, both were equally its\r\nwealth, and should therefore equally add to the quota of its tax.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison (of Virginia) proposed, as a compromise, that two slaves\r\nshould be counted as one freeman. He affirmed that slaves did not do\r\nas much work as freemen, and doubted if two affected more than one.\r\nThat this was proved by the price of labor, the hire of a laborer in\r\nthe Southern colonies being from £9 to £12, while in the Northern it\r\nwas generally £24.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson (of Pennsylvania) said, that if this amendment should take\r\nplace, the Southern colonies would have all the benefit of slaves,\r\nwhilst the Northern ones would bear the burthen. That slaves increase\r\nthe profits of a State, which the Southern States mean to take to\r\nthemselves; that they also increase the burthen of defence, which\r\nwould of course fall so much the heavier on the Northern; that slaves\r\noccupy the places of freemen and eat their food. Dismiss your slaves,\r\nand freemen will take their places. It is our duty to lay every\r\ndiscouragement on the importation of slaves; but this amendment would\r\ngive thee _jus trium liberorum_ to him who would import slaves. That\r\nother kinds of property were pretty equally distributed through all\r\nthe colonies: there were as many cattle, horses, and sheep, in the\r\nNorth as the South, and South as the North; but not so as to slaves:\r\nthat experience has shown that those colonies have been always able to\r\npay most, which have the most inhabitants, whether they be black or\r\nwhite; and the practice of the Southern colonies has always been to\r\nmake every farmer pay poll taxes upon all his laborers, whether they\r\nbe black or white. He acknowledged indeed that freemen worked the\r\nmost; but they consume the most also. They do not produce a greater\r\nsurplus for taxation. The slave is neither fed nor clothed so\r\nexpensively as a freeman. Again, white women are exempted from labor\r\ngenerally, which negro women are not. In this then the Southern States\r\nhave an advantage as the article now stands. It has sometimes been\r\nsaid that slavery was necessary, because the commodities they raise\r\nwould be too dear for market if cultivated by freemen; but now it is\r\nsaid that the labor of the slave is the dearest.\r\n\r\nMr. Payne (of Massachusetts) urged the original resolution of Congress,\r\nto proportion the quotas of the States to the number of souls.\r\n\r\nMr. Witherspoon (of New-Jersey) was of opinion, that the value of\r\nlands and houses was the best estimate of the wealth of a nation, and\r\nthat it was practicable to obtain such a valuation. This is the true\r\nbarometer of wealth. The one now proposed is imperfect in itself, and\r\nunequal between the States. It has been objected that negroes eat the\r\nfood of freemen, and therefore should be taxed. Horses also eat the\r\nfood of freemen; therefore they also should be taxed. It has been said\r\ntoo, that in carrying slaves into the estimate of the taxes the State\r\nis to pay, we do no more than those States themselves do, who always\r\ntake slaves into the estimate of the taxes the individual is to pay.\r\nBut the cases are not parallel. In the Southern Colonies, slaves\r\npervade the whole colony; but they do not pervade the whole continent.\r\nThat as to the original resolution of Congress, it was temporary only,\r\nand related to the moneys heretofore emitted: whereas we are now\r\nentering into a new compact, and therefore stand on original ground.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1st. The question being put, the amendment proposed was\r\nrejected by the votes of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island,\r\nConnecticut, New-York, New-Jersey and Pennsylvania, against those of\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North, and South Carolina. Georgia was\r\ndivided. _Vol. I. pp_. 27-8-9, 30-1-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extracts from Madison's Report of Debates in the Congress of the\r\nConfederation._\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, Feb. 11, 1783.\r\n\r\nMr. Wolcott declares his opinion that the Confederation ought to be\r\namended by substituting numbers of inhabitants as the rule; admits the\r\ndifference between freemen and blacks; and suggests a compromise, by\r\nincluding in the numeration such blacks only as were within sixteen\r\nand sixty years of age. _p_. 331.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, March 27, 1783.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh and twelfth paragraphs:\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson (of Pennsylvania) was strenuous in their favor; said he was\r\nin Congress when the Articles of Confederation directing a valuation\r\nof land were agreed to; that it was the effect of the impossibility of\r\ncompromising the different ideas of the Eastern and Southern States,\r\nas to the value of slaves compared with the whites, the alternative in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark (of New Jersey) was in favor of them. He said that he was\r\nalso in Congress when this article was decided; that the Southern\r\nStates would have agreed to numbers in preference to the value of\r\nland, if half their slaves only should be included; but that the\r\nEastern States would not concur in that proposition.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed, on all sides, that, instead of fixing the proportion by\r\nages, as the, report proposed, it would be best to fix the proportion\r\nin absolute numbers. With this view, and that the blank might be\r\nfilled up, the clause was recommitted. _p._ 421-2.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, March 28, 1783.\r\n\r\nThe committee last mentioned, reported that two blacks be rated as one\r\nfreeman.\r\n\r\nMr. Wolcott (of Connecticut) was for rating them as four to three. Mr.\r\nCarroll as four to one. Mr. Williamson (of North Carolina) said he was\r\nprincipled against slavery; and that he thought slaves an incumbrance\r\nto society, instead of increasing its ability to pay taxes. Mr.\r\nHigginson (of Massachusetts) as four to three. Mr. Rutledge (of South\r\nCarolina) said, for the sake of the object, he would agree to rate\r\nslaves as two to one, but he sincerely thought three to one would he a\r\njuster proportion. Mr. Holton as four to three.--Mr. Osgood said he\r\ndid not go beyond four to three. On a question for rating them as\r\nthree to two, the votes were. New Hampshire, aye; Massachusetts, no;\r\nRhode Island, divided; Connecticut, aye; New Jersey, aye;\r\nPennsylvania, aye; Delaware, aye; Maryland, no; Virginia, no; North\r\nCarolina, no; South Carolina, no. The paragraph was then proposed, by\r\ngeneral consent, some wishing for further time to deliberate on it;\r\nbut it appearing to be the general opinion that no compromise would be\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\nAfter some further discussions on the Report, in which the necessity\r\nof some simple and practicable rule of apportionment came fully into\r\nview, Mr. Madison (of Virginia) said that, in order to give a proof of\r\nthe sincerity of his professions of liberality, he would propose that\r\nslaves should be rated as five to three. Mr. Rutledge (of South\r\nCarolina) seconded the motion. Mr. Wilson (of Pennsylvania) said he\r\nwould sacrifice his opinion on this compromise.\r\n\r\nMr. Lee was against changing the rule, but gave it as his opinion that\r\ntwo slaves were not equal to one freeman.\r\n\r\nOn the question for five to three, it passed in the affirmative; New\r\nHampshire, aye; Massachusetts, divided; Rhode Island, no;\r\nConnecticut, no; New Jersey, aye; Pennsylvania, aye; Maryland, aye;\r\nVirginia, aye; North Carolina, aye: South Carolina, aye.\r\n\r\nA motion was then made by Mr. Bland, seconded by Mr. Lee, to strike\r\nout the clause so amended, and, on the question \"Shall it stand,\" it\r\npassed in the negative; New Hampshire, aye; Massachusetts, no; Rhode\r\nIsland, no; Connecticut, no; New Jersey, aye; Pennsylvania, aye;\r\nDelaware, no; Maryland, aye; Virginia, aye; North Carolina, aye; South\r\nCarolina, no; so the clause was struck out.\r\n\r\nThe arguments used by those who were for rating slaves high were, that\r\nthe expense of feeding and clothing them was as far below that\r\nincident to freemen as their industry and ingenuity were below those\r\nof freemen; and that the warm climate within which the States having\r\nslaves lay, compared with the rigorous climate and inferior fertility\r\nof the others, ought to have greater weight in the case; and that the\r\nexports of the former States were greater than of the latter. On the\r\nother side, it was said, that slaves were not put to labor as young as\r\nthe children of laboring families; that, having no interest in their\r\nlabor, they did as little as possible and omitted every exertion of\r\nthought requisite to facilitate and expedite it: that if the exports\r\nof the States having slaves exceeded those of the others, their\r\nimports were in proportion, slaves being employed wholly in\r\nagriculture, not in manufacturers; and that, in fact, the balance of\r\ntrade formerly was much more against the Southern States than the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nOn the main question, New Hampshire, aye; Massachusetts, no; Rhode\r\nIsland, no; Connecticut, no; New York (Mr. Lloyd, aye); New Jersey,\r\naye; Delaware, no; Maryland, aye; Virginia, aye; North Carolina, aye;\r\nSouth Carolina, no. _pp._ 423-4-5.\r\n\r\nTuesday, April 1, 1783.\r\n\r\nCongress resumed the Report on Revenue, &c. Mr. Hamilton, who had been\r\nabsent when the last question was taken for substituting numbers in\r\nplace of the value of land, moved to reconsider that vote. He was\r\nseconded by Mr. Osgood. Those who voted differently from their former\r\nvotes were influenced by the conviction of the necessity of the\r\nchange, and despair on both sides of a more favorable rate of the\r\nslaves. The rate of three-fifths was agreed to without opposition.\r\n_p_. 430.\r\n\r\nMonday, May 26.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions on the Journal, instructing the ministers in Europe to\r\nremonstrate against the carrying off the negroes--also those for\r\nfurloughing the troops--passed _unanimously_. _p_. 456.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_Extract from \"Debates in the Federal Convention\" of 1787, for the\r\nformation of the Constitution of the United States_.\r\n\r\nMonday, June 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nIt was then moved by Mr. Rutledge, seconded by Mr. Butler, to add to\r\nthe words, \"equitable ratio of representation,\" at the end of the\r\nmotion just agreed to, the words, \"according to the quotas of\r\ncontribution.\" On motion of Mr. Wilson, seconded by Mr. Pinckney, this\r\nwas postponed, in order to add, after the words, \"equitable rates of\r\nrepresentation,\" the words following: \"In proportion to the whole\r\nnumber of white and other free citizens and inhabitants of every age,\r\nsex and condition, including those bound to servitude for a term of\r\nyears, and three fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the\r\nforegoing description, except Indians not paying taxes, in each\r\nState\"--this being the rule in the act of Congress, agreed to by\r\neleven States, for apportioning quotas of revenue on the States, and\r\nrequiring a census only every five, seven, or ten years.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerry (of Massachusetts) thought property not the rule of\r\nrepresentation. Why, then, should the blacks, who were property in the\r\nSouth, be in the rule of representation more than, the cattle and\r\nhorses of the North?\r\n\r\nOn the question,--Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, aye--9;\r\nNew jersey, Delaware, no--2. _Vol. II. pp._ 842-3.\r\n\r\nSaturday, June 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nHe (Mr. Madison) admitted that every peculiar interest, whether in any\r\nclass of citizens, or any description of states, ought to be secured\r\nas far as possible. Wherever there is danger of attack, there ought to\r\nbe given a constitutional power of defence. But he contended that the\r\nStates were divided into different interests, not by their difference\r\nof size, but by other circumstances; the most material of which\r\nresulted partly from climate, but principally from the effects of\r\ntheir having or not having slaves. These two causes concurred in\r\nforming the great division of interests in the United States. It did\r\nnot lie between the large and small States. IT LAY BETWEEN THE\r\nNORTHERN AND SOUTHERN; and if any defensive power were necessary, it\r\nought to be mutually given to these two interests. He was so strongly\r\nimpressed with this important truth, that he had been casting about in\r\nhis mind for some expedient that would answer the purpose. The one\r\nwhich had occurred was, that instead of proportioning the votes of the\r\nStates in both branches to their respective numbers of inhabitants,\r\ncomputing the slaves in the ratio of five to three, they should he\r\nrepresented in one branch according to the number of free inhabitants\r\nonly; and in the other, according to the whole number, counting the\r\nslaves us free. By this arrangement the Southern scale would have the\r\nadvantage in one House, and the Northern in the other. He had been\r\nrestrained from proposing this expedient by two considerations; one\r\nwas his unwillingness to urge any diversity of interests on an\r\noccasion where it is but too apt to arise of itself; the other was,\r\nthe inequality of powers that must be vested in the two branches, and\r\nwhich would destroy the equilibrium of interests. _pp._ 1006-7.\r\n\r\nMonday, July 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Patterson considered the proposed estimate for the future\r\naccording to the combined rules of numbers and wealth, as too vague.\r\nFor this reason New Jersey was against it. He could regard negro\r\nslaves in no light but as property. They are no free agents, have no\r\npersonal liberty, no faculty of acquiring property, but on the\r\ncontrary are themselves property, and like other property, entirely at\r\nthe will of the master. Has a man in Virginia a number of votes in\r\nproportion to the number of his slaves? And if negroes are not\r\nrepresented in the States to which they belong, why should they be\r\nrepresented in the General Government. What is the true principle of\r\nrepresentation? It is an experiment by which an assembly of certain\r\nindividuals, chosen, by the people, is substituted in place of the\r\ninconvenient meeting of the people themselves. If such a meeting of\r\nthe people was actually to take place, would the slaves vote? They\r\nwould not. Why then should they be represented? He was also against\r\nsuch an indirect encouragement of the slave trade; observing that\r\nCongress, in their act relating to the change of the eighth article of\r\nConfederation, had been assigned to use the term \"slaves,\" and had\r\nsubstituted a description.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison reminded Mr. Patterson that his doctrine of\r\nrepresentation, which was in its principle the genuine one, must for\r\never silence the pretensions of the small States to an equality of\r\nvotes with the large ones. They ought to vote in the same proportion\r\nin which their citizens would do if the people of all the States were\r\ncollectively met. He suggested, as a proper ground of compromise, that\r\nin the first branch the States should be represented according to\r\ntheir number of free inhabitants; and in the second, which has for one\r\nof its primary objects, the guardianship of property, according to the\r\nwhole number, including slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler urged warmly the justice and necessity of regarding wealth\r\nin the apportionment of representation.\r\n\r\nMr. King had always expected, that, as the Southern States are the\r\nrichest, they would not league themselves with the Northern, unless\r\nsome respect was paid to their superior wealth. If the latter expect\r\nthose preferential distinctions in commerce, and other advantages\r\nwhich they will derive from the connexion, they must not expect to\r\nreceive them without allowing some advantages in return. Eleven out of\r\nthirteen of the States had agreed to consider slaves in the\r\napportionment of taxation; and taxation and representation ought to go\r\ntogether. _pp_. 1054-5-6.\r\n\r\nTuesday, July 10; 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. King remarked that the four Eastern States, having 800,000 souls,\r\nhave one-third fewer representatives than the four Southern States,\r\nhaving not more than 700,000 souls, rating the blacks as five for\r\nthree. The Eastern people will advert to these circumstances, and be\r\ndissatisfied. He believed them to be very desirous of uniting with\r\ntheir Southern brethren, but did not think it prudent to rely so far\r\non that disposition, as to subject them to any gross inequality. He\r\nwas fully convinced that THE QUESTION CONCERNING A DIFFERENCE OF\r\nINTERESTS DID NOT LIE WHERE IT HAD HITHERTO BEEN DISCUSSED, BETWEEN\r\nTHE GREAT AND SMALL STATES: BUT BETWEEN THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN. _p_.\r\n1057.\r\n\r\nWednesday, July 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler and General Pinckney insisted that blacks be included in\r\nrule of representation _equally_ with the whites; and for that purpose\r\nmoved that the words \"three-fifths\" be struck out.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerry thought that three fifths of them was, to say the least, the\r\nfull proportion that could be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. Gorham. This ratio was fixed by Congress as a rule of taxation.\r\nThen, it was urged, by the delegates representing the States having\r\nslaves, that the blacks were still more inferior to freemen. At\r\npresent, when the ratio of representation is to be established, we are\r\nassured that they are equal to freemen. The arguments on the former\r\noccasion had convinced them that three fifths was pretty near the just\r\nproportion, he should vote according to the same opinion now.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler insisted that the labor of a slave in South Carolina was as\r\nproductive and valuable as that of a freeman in Massachusetts; that as\r\nwealth was the greatest means of defence and utility to the nation,\r\nthey were equally valuable to it with freemen; and that consequently\r\nan equal representation ought to be allowed for them in a government\r\nwhich was instituted principally, for the protection of property, and\r\nwas itself to be supported by property.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason could not agree to the motion, notwithstanding it was\r\nfavorable to Virginia, because he thought it unjust. It was certain\r\nthat the slaves were valuable, as they raised the value of land,\r\nincreased the exports and imports, and of course the revenue, would\r\nsupply the means of feeding and supporting an army, and might in cases\r\nof emergency become themselves soldiers. As in these important\r\nrespects they were useful to the community at large, they ought not to\r\nbe excluded from the estimate of representation. He could not,\r\nhowever, regard them as equal to freemen, and could not vote for them\r\nas such. He added, as worthy of remark, that the Southern States have\r\nthis peculiar species of property, over and above the other species of\r\nproperty common to all the States.\r\n\r\nMr. Williamson reminded Mr. Gorham, that if the Southern States\r\ncontended for the inferiority of blacks to whites, when taxation was\r\nin view, the Eastern States, on the same occasion, contended for their\r\nequality. He did not, however, either then or now, concur in either\r\nextreme, but approved of the ratio of three-fifths.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Butler's motion, for considering blacks as equal to whites in\r\nthe apportionment of representation,--Delaware, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, aye--3; Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, no--7. New York not on the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris said he had several objections to the\r\nproposition of Mr. Williamson. In the first place it fettered the\r\nLegislature too much. In the second place, it would exclude some\r\nStates altogether who would not have a sufficient number to entitle\r\nthem to a single representation. In the third place, it will not\r\nconsist with the resolution passed on Saturday last, authorizing the\r\nLegislature to adjust the representation, from time to time on the\r\nprinciples of population and wealth; nor with the principles of\r\nequity. If slaves were to be considered as inhabitants, not as wealth,\r\nthen the said resolution would not be pursued; if as wealth, then why\r\nis no other wealth but slaves included? These objections may perhaps\r\nbe removed by amendments.... Another objection with him, against\r\nadmitting the blacks into the census, was, that the people of\r\nPennsylvania would revolt at the idea of being put on a footing with\r\nslaves. They would reject any plan that was to have such an effect.\r\npp. 1067-8-9 & 1072.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, JULY 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nThe next clause as to three-fifths of the negroes being considered:\r\n\r\nMr. King, being much opposed to fixing numbers as the rule of\r\nrepresentation, was particularly so on account of the blacks. He\r\nthought the admission of them along with whites at all, would excite\r\ngreat discontents among the States having no slaves. He had never\r\nsaid, as to any particular point, that he would in no event acquiesce\r\nin and support it; but he would say that if in any case such a\r\ndeclaration was to be made by him, it would be in this.\r\n\r\nHe remarked that in the temporary allotment of representatives made by\r\nthe Committee, the Southern States had received more than the number\r\nof their white and three-fifths of their black inhabitants entitled\r\nthem to.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman. South Carolina had not more beyond her proportion than\r\nNew York and New Hampshire; nor either of them more than was necessary\r\nin order to avoid fractions, or reducing them below their proportion.\r\nGeorgia had more; but the rapid growth of that State seemed to justify\r\nit. In general the allotment might not be just, but considering all\r\ncircumstances he was satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Gorham was aware that there might be some weight in what had\r\nfallen from his colleague, as to the umbrage which might be taken by\r\nthe people of the Eastern States. But he recollected that when the\r\nproposition of Congress for changing the eighth Article of the\r\nConfederation was before the Legislature of Massachusetts, the only\r\ndifficulty then was, to satisfy them that the negroes ought not to\r\nhave been counted equally with the whites, instead of being counted in\r\nthe ratio of three-fifths only.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: They were then to have been a rule of taxation only.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson did not well see, on what principle the admission of blacks\r\nin the proportion of three fifths could be explained. Are they\r\nadmitted as citizens--then why are they not admitted on an equality\r\nwith white citizens? Are they admitted as property--then why is not\r\nother property admitted into the computation? These were difficulties,\r\nhowever, which he thought must be overruled by the necessity of\r\ncompromise. He had some apprehensions also, from the tendency of the\r\nblending of the blacks with the whites, to give disgust to the people\r\nof Pennsylvania, as had been intimated by his colleague (Mr.\r\nGouverneur Morris.)\r\n\r\nMr. Gouvemeur Morris was compelled to declare himself reduced to the\r\ndilemma of doing injustice to the Southern States, or to human nature;\r\nand he must therefore do it to the former. For he could never agree to\r\ngive such encouragement to the slave trade, as would be given by\r\nallowing them a representation for their negroes; and he did not\r\nbelieve those States would ever confederate on terms that would\r\ndeprive them of that trade.\r\n\r\nOn the question for agreeing to include three-fifths of the\r\nblacks,--Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina. Georgia, aye--4;\r\nMassachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,[2] South\r\nCarolina, no--6. pp. 1076-7-8.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Carroll said, in explanation of the vote of Maryland,\r\nthat he wished the _phraseology_ to be altered as to obviate, if\r\npossible, the danger which had been expressed of giving umbrage to the\r\nEastern and Middle States.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, July 12, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler contended that representation should be according to the\r\nfull number of inhabitants, including all the blacks.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pinckney was alarmed at what was said yesterday, [by\r\nGouverneur Morris,] concerning the negroes. He was now again alarmed\r\nat what had been thrown out concerning the taxing of exports. South\r\nCarolina has in one year exported to the amount of 600,000£. sterling,\r\nall which was the fruit of the labor of her blacks. Will she be\r\nrepresented in proportion to this amount? She will not. Neither ought\r\nshe then be subject to a tax on it. He hoped a clause would be\r\ninserted in the system, restraining the Legislature from taxing\r\nexports.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris having so varied his motion by inserting the\r\nword \"direct,\" it passed, _nem. con._, as follows: \"provided always\r\nthat direct taxation ought to be proportioned to representation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davie said it was high time now to speak out. He saw that it was\r\nmeant by some gentlemen to deprive the Southern States of any share of\r\nrepresentation for their blacks. He was sure that North Carolina would\r\nnever confederate on any terms that did not rate them at least as\r\nthree-fifths. If the Eastern States meant, therefore, to exclude them\r\naltogether, the business was at an end.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson thought that wealth and population were the true,\r\nequitable rules of representation; but he conceived that these two\r\nprinciples resolved themselves into one, population being the best\r\nmeasure of wealth. He concluded, therefore, that the number of people\r\nought to be established as the rule, and that all descriptions,\r\nincluding blacks _equally_ with the whites, ought to fall within the\r\ncomputation. As various opinions had been expressed on the subject, he\r\nwould move that a committee might be appointed to take them into\r\nconsideration, and report them.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris. It had been said that it is high time to speak\r\nout. As one member, he would candidly do so. He came here to form a\r\ncompact for the good of America. He was ready to do so with all the\r\nStates. He hoped, and believed, that all would enter into such\r\ncompact. If they would not, he was ready to join with any States that\r\nwould. But as the compact was to be voluntary, it is in vain for the\r\nEastern States to insist on what the Southern States will never agree\r\nto. It is equally vain for the latter to require, what the other\r\nStates can never admit; and he verily believed the people of\r\nPennsylvania will never agree to a representation of negroes. What can\r\nbe desired by these States more then has been already proposed--that\r\nthe legislature shall from time to time regulate representation\r\naccording to population and wealth?\r\n\r\nGeneral Pinckney desired that the rule of wealth should be\r\nascertained, and not left to the pleasure of the legislature; and that\r\nproperty in slaves should not be exposed to danger, under a government\r\ninstituted for the protection of property.\r\n\r\nThe first clause in the Report of the first Grand Committee was\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellsworth, in order to carry into effect the principle\r\nestablished, moved to add to the last clause adopted by the House, the\r\nwords following, \"and that the rule of contribution for direct\r\ntaxation, for the support of the government of the United States,\r\nshall be the number of white inhabitants, and three-fifths of every\r\nother description in the several States, until some other use rule\r\nthat shall more accurately ascertain the wealth of the several States,\r\ncan be devised and adopted by the Legislature.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Butler seconded the motion, in order that it might be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph was not satisfied with the motion. The danger will be\r\nrevived, that the ingenuity of the Legislature may evade or pervert\r\nthe rule, so as to perpetuate the power where it shall be lodged in\r\nthe first instance. He proposed, in lieu of Mr. Ellsworth's motion,\r\n\"that in order to ascertain the alterations in representation that may\r\nbe required, from time to time, by changes in the relative\r\ncircumstances of the States, a census shall be taken within two years\r\nfrom the first meeting of the General Legislature of the United\r\nStates, and once within the term of every ---- years afterwards, of\r\nall the inhabitants, in the manner and according to the ratio\r\nrecommended by Congress in their Resolution of the eighteenth day of\r\nApril, 1783, (rating the blacks at three-fifths of their number;) and\r\nthat the Legislature of the United States shall arrange the\r\nrepresentation accordingly.\" He urged strenuously that express\r\nsecurity ought to be provided for including slaves in the ratio of\r\nrepresentation. He lamented that such a species of property existed.\r\nBut as it did exist, the holders of it would require this security. It\r\nwas perceived that the design was entertained by some of excluding\r\nslaves altogether; the Legislature therefore ought not to be left at\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellsworth withdraws his motion, and seconds that of Mr. Randolph.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson observed, that less umbrage would perhaps be taken against\r\nan admission of the slaves into the rule of representation, if it\r\nshould be so expressed as to make them indirectly only an ingredient\r\nin the rule, by saying that they should enter into the rule of\r\ntaxation; and as representation was to be according to taxation, the\r\nend would be equally attained.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney moved to amend Mr. Randolph's motion, so as to make\r\n\"blacks equal to the whites in the ratio of representation.\" This, he\r\nurged, was nothing more than justice. The blacks are the laborers, the\r\npeasants, of the Southern States. They are as productive of pecuniary\r\nresources as those of the northern states. They add equally to the\r\nwealth, and, considering money as the sinew of war, to the strength,\r\nof the nation. It will also be politic with regard to the Northern\r\nStates, as taxation is to keep pace with representation.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Pinckney's (of S. Carolina) motion, for rating blacks as equal\r\nto whites, instead of as three-fifths,--South Carolina, Georgia, aye\r\n--2; Massachusetts, Connecticut (Doctor Johnson, aye), New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania (three against two), Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, no--8.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph's (of Virginia) proposition, as varied by Mr. Wilson (of\r\nPennsylvania) being read for taking the question on the whole,--\r\n\r\nMr. Gerry (of Massachusetts) urged that the principle of it could not\r\nbe carried into execution, as the States were not to be taxed as\r\nStates. With regard to taxes on imposts, he conceived they would be\r\nmore productive when there were no slaves, than where there were; the\r\nconsumption being greater.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellsworth (of Connecticut.)  In the case of a poll-tax there would\r\nbe no difficulty. But there would probably be none. The sum allotted\r\nto a State may be levied without difficulty, according to the plan\r\nused by the State in raising its own supplies.\r\n\r\nOn the question on the whole proposition, as proportioning\r\nrepresentation to direct taxation, and both to the white and\r\nthree-fifths of the black inhabitants, and requiring a census within\r\nsix years, and within every ten years afterwards,--Connecticut,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, aye--6;\r\nNew-Jersey, Delaware, no--2; Massachusetts, South Carolina, divided.\r\n_pp._ 1079 to 1087.\r\n\r\nFriday, July 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nOn the motion of Mr. Randolph (of Virginia), the vote of Monday last,\r\nauthorizing the Legislature to adjust, from time to time, the\r\nrepresentation upon the principles of _wealth_ and numbers of\r\ninhabitants, was reconsidered by common consent, in order to strike\r\nout _wealth_ and adjust the resolution to that requiring periodical\r\nrevisions according to the number of whites and three-fifths of the\r\nblacks.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris (of Pennsylvania) opposed the alteration, as\r\nleaving still an incoherence. If negroes were to be viewed as\r\ninhabitants, and the revision was to proceed on the principle of\r\nnumbers of inhabitants, they ought to be added in their entire number,\r\nand not in the proportion of three-fifths. If as property, the word\r\nwealth was right; and striking it out would produce the very\r\ninconsistency which it was meant to get rid of. The train of\r\nbusiness, and the late turn which it had taken, had led him, he said,\r\ninto deep meditation on it, and he would candidly state the result. A\r\ndistinction has been set up, and urged, between the Northern and\r\nSouthern States. He had hitherto considered this doctrine as\r\nheretical. He still thought the distinction groundless. He sees,\r\nhowever, that it is persisted in; and the Southern gentlemen will not\r\nbe satisfied unless they see the way open to their gaining a majority\r\nin the public councils. The consequence of such a transfer of power\r\nfrom the maritime to the interior and landed interest, will, he\r\nforesees, be such an oppression to commerce, that he shall be obliged\r\nto vote for the vicious principle of equality in the second branch, in\r\norder to provide some defence for the Northern States against it. But\r\nto come more to the point, either this distinction is fictitious or\r\nreal; if fictitious, let it be dismissed, and let us proceed with due\r\nconfidence. If it be real, instead of attempting to blend\r\nincompatible things, let us at once take a friendly leave of each\r\nother. There can be no end of demands for security, if every\r\nparticular interest is to be entitled to it. The Eastern States may\r\nclaim it for their fishery, and for other objects, as the Southern\r\nStates claim it for their peculiar objects. In this struggle between\r\nthe two ends of the Union, what part ought the Middle States, in point\r\nof policy, to take?  To join their Eastern brethren, according to his\r\nideas. If the Southern States get the power into their hands, and be\r\njoined, as they will be, with the interior country, they will\r\ninevitably bring on a war with Spain for the Mississippi. This\r\nlanguage is already held. The interior country, leaving no property\r\nnor interest exposed to the sea, will be little affected by such a\r\nwar. He wished to know what security the Northern and Middle States\r\nwill have against this danger. It has been said that North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Georgia only, will in a little time have a\r\nmajority of the people of America. They must in that case include the\r\ngreat interior country, and every thing was to be apprehended from\r\ntheir getting the power into their hands.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler (of South Carolina). The security the Southern States want\r\nis, that their negroes may not be taken from them, which some\r\ngentlemen within or without doors have a very good mind to do. It was\r\nnot supposed that North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, would\r\nhave more people than all the other States, but many more relatively\r\nto the other States, than they now have. The people and strength of\r\nAmerica are evidently bearing southwardly, and southwestwardly.\r\n\r\nOn the question to strike out _wealth_, and to make the change as\r\nmoved by Mr. Randoph (of Virginia), it passed in the affirmative,--\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, aye--9; Delaware,\r\ndivided. _pp_. 1090-1-2-3-4.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, July 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison (of Virginia). it seemed now pretty well understood, that\r\nthe real difference of interests lay, not between the large and small,\r\nbut between the Northern and Southern States. THE INSTITUTION OF\r\nSLAVERY, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES, FORMED THE LINE OF DISCRIMINATION. _p_.\r\n1104.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, July 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pinckney reminded the Convention, that if the Committee should\r\nfail to insert some security to the Southern States against an\r\nemancipation of slaves, and taxes on exports, he should be bound by\r\nduty to his State to vote against their report. _p_. 1187.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, July 24, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris hoped the Committee would strike out the whole\r\nof the clause proportioning direct taxation to representation. He had\r\nonly meant it as a bridge[3] to assist us over a certain gulf; having\r\npassed the gulf, the bridge may be removed. He thought the principle\r\nlaid down with so much strictness liable to strong objections. _p_.\r\n1197.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The object was to lessen the eagerness, on one side, for,\r\nand the opposition, on the other, to the share of representation\r\nclaimed by the Southern States on account of the negroes.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, August 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. King wished to know what influence the vote just passed was meant\r\nto have on the succeeding part of the Report, concerning the admission\r\nof slaves into the rule of representation. He could not reconcile his\r\nmind to the Article, if it was to prevent objections to the latter\r\npart. The admission of slaves was a most grating circumstance to his\r\nmind, and he believed would be so to a great part of the people of\r\nAmerica. He had not made a strenuous opposition to it heretofore,\r\nbecause he had hope that this concession would have produced a\r\nreadiness, which had not been manifested, to strengthen the General\r\nGovernment, and to mark a full confidence in it. The Report under\r\nconsideration had, by the tenor of it, put an end to all those hopes.\r\nIn two great points the hands of the Legislature were absolutely tied.\r\nThe importation of slaves could not be prohibited. Exports could not\r\nbe taxed. Is this reasonable? What are the great objects of the\r\ngeneral system? First, defence against foreign invasion; secondly,\r\nagainst internal sedition. Shall all the States, then, be bound to\r\ndefend each, and shall each be at liberty to introduce a weakness\r\nwhich will render defence more difficult? Shall one part of the United\r\nStates be bound to defend another part, and that other part be at\r\nliberty, not only to increase its own danger, but to withhold the\r\ncompensation for the burden? If slaves are to be imported, shall not\r\nthe exports produced by their labor supply a revenue the better to\r\nenable the General Government to defend their masters? There was so\r\nmuch inequality and unreasonableness in all this, that the people of\r\nthe Northern States could never be reconciled to it. No candid man\r\ncould undertake to justify it to them. He had hoped that some\r\naccommodation would have taken place on this subject; that at least a\r\ntime would have been limited for the importation of slaves. He never\r\ncould agree to let them be imported without limitation, and then be\r\nrepresented in the National Legislature. Indeed, he could so little\r\npersuade himself of the rectitude of such a practice, that he was not\r\nsure he could assent to it under any circumstances. At all events,\r\neither slaves should not be represented, or exports should be taxable.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman regarded the slave trade as iniquitous; but the point of\r\nrepresentation having been settled after much difficulty and\r\ndeliberation, he did not think himself bound to make opposition;\r\nespecially as the present Article, as amended, did not preclude any\r\narrangement whatever on that point, in another place of the report.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris moved to insert \"free\" before the word\r\n\"inhabitants.\" Much, he said, would depend on this point. He never\r\nwould concur in upholding domestic slavery. It was a nefarious\r\ninstitution. It was the curse of Heaven on the States where it\r\nprevailed. Compare the free regions of the Middle States, where a rich\r\nand noble cultivation marks the prosperity and happiness of the\r\npeople, with the misery and poverty which overspread the barren wastes\r\nof Virginia, Maryland, and the other States having slaves. Travel\r\nthrough the whole continent, and you behold the prospect continually\r\nvarying with the appearance and disappearance of slavery. The moment\r\nyou leave the Eastern States, and enter New-York, the effects of the\r\ninstitution become visible. Passing through the Jerseys and entering\r\nPennsylvania, every criterion of superior improvement witnesses the\r\nchange. Proceed southwardly, and every step you take, through the\r\ngreat regions of slaves, presents a desert increasing with the\r\nincreasing proportion of these wretched beings. Upon what principle is\r\nit that the slaves shall be computed in the representation? Are they\r\nmen? Then make them citizens, and let them vote. Are they property?\r\nWhy, then is no other property included? The houses in this city\r\n(Philadelphia) are worth more than all the wretched slaves who cover\r\nthe rice swamps of South Carolina. The admission of slaves into the\r\nrepresentation, when fairly explained, comes to this, that the\r\ninhabitant of Georgia and South Carolina, who goes to the coast of\r\nAfrica, and, in defiance of the most sacred laws of humanity, tears\r\naway his fellow-creatures from their dearest connections, and damns\r\nthem to the most cruel bondage, shall have more votes in a government\r\ninstituted for protection of the rights of mankind, than the citizen\r\nof Pennsylvania or New-Jersey, who views with a laudable horror so\r\nnefarious a practice. He would add, that domestic slavery is the most\r\nprominent feature in the aristocratic countenance of the proposed\r\nConstitution. The vassalage of the poor has ever been the favorite\r\noffspring of aristocracy. And what is the proposed compensation to the\r\nNorthern States, for a sacrifice of every principle of right, of every\r\nimpulse of humanity? They are to bind themselves to march their\r\nmilitia for the defence of the Southern States, for their defence\r\nagainst those very slaves of whom they complain. They must supply\r\nvessels and seamen, in case of foreign attack. The Legislature will\r\nhave indefinite power to tax them by excises, and duties on imports;\r\nboth of which will fall heavier on them than on the Southern\r\ninhabitants; for the bohea tea used by a Northern freeman will pay\r\nmore tax than the whole consumption of the miserable slave, which\r\nconsists of nothing more than his physical subsistence and the rag\r\nthat covers his nakedness. On the other side, the Southern States are\r\nnot to be restrained from importing fresh supplies of wretched\r\nAfricans, at once to increase the danger of attack, and the difficulty\r\nof defence; nay, they are to be encouraged to it, by an assurance of\r\nhaving their votes in the National Government increased in proportion;\r\nand are, at the same time, to have their exports and their slaves\r\nexempt from all contributions for the public service. Let it not be\r\nsaid, that direct taxation is to be proportioned to representation.\r\nIt is idle to suppose that the General Government can stretch its hand\r\ndirectly into the pockets of the people, scattered over so vast a\r\ncountry. They can only do it through the medium of exports, imports\r\nand excises. For what, then, are all the sacrifices to be made? He\r\nwould sooner submit himself to a tax for paying for all the negroes in\r\nthe United States, than saddle posterity with such a Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Dayton seconded the motion. He did it, he said, that his\r\nsentiments on the subject might appear, whatever might be the fate of\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman did not regard the admission of the negroes into the ratio\r\nof representation, as liable to such insuperable objections. It was\r\nthe freemen of the Southern States who were, in fact, to be\r\nrepresented according to the taxes paid by them, and the negroes are\r\nonly included in the estimate of the taxes. This was his idea of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney considered the fisheries, and the western frontier, as\r\nmore burthensome to the United States than the slaves. He thought this\r\ncould be demonstrated, if the occasion were a proper one.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson thought the motion premature. An agreement to the clause\r\nwould be no bar to the object of it.\r\n\r\nOn the question, on the motion to insert \"free\" before \"inhabitants,\"\r\nNew-Jersey, aye--1; New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, no--10. pp. 1261-2-3-4-5-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, August 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. L. Martin proposed to vary Article 7, Section 4, so as to allow a\r\nprohibition or tax on the importation of slaves. In the first place,\r\nas five slaves are to be counted as three freemen, in the\r\napportionment of Representatives, such a clause would leave an\r\nencouragement to this traffic. In the second place, slaves weakened\r\none part of the Union, which the other parts were bound to protect;\r\nthe privilege of importing them was therefore unreasonable. And in the\r\nthird place, it was inconsistent with the principles of the\r\nRevolution, and dishonorable to the American character, to have such a\r\nfeature in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Rutledge did not see how the importation of slaves could be\r\nencouraged by this section. He was not apprehensive of insurrections,\r\nand would readily exempt the other states from the obligation to\r\nprotect the Southern against them. Religion and humanity had nothing\r\nto do with this question. Interest alone is the governing principle\r\nwith nations. The true question at present is, whether the Southern\r\nStates shall or shall not be parties to the Union. If the Northern\r\nStates consult their interest, they will not oppose the increase of\r\nslaves, which will increase the commodities of which they will become\r\nthe carriers.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellsworth was for leaving the clause as it stands. Let every State\r\nimport what it pleases. The morality or wisdom of slavery are\r\nconsiderations belonging to the States themselves. What enriches a\r\npart enriches the whole, and the States are the best judges of their\r\nparticular interest. The Old Confederation had not meddled with this\r\npoint; and he did not see any greater necessity for bringing it within\r\nthe policy of the new one.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney. South Carolina can never receive the plan if it\r\nprohibits the slave trade. In every proposed extension of the powers\r\nof Congress, that State has expressly and watchfully excepted that of\r\nmeddling with the importation of negroes. If the States be all left at\r\nliberty on this subject, South Carolina may perhaps, by degrees, do of\r\nherself what is wished, as Virginia and Maryland already have done.\r\nAdjourned. _pp_. 1388-9.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, August 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 7, Section 4, was resumed.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman was for leaving the clause as it stands. He disapproved of\r\nthe slave trade; yet as the States were now possessed of the right to\r\nimport slaves, as the public good did not require it to be taken from\r\nthem, and as it was expedient to have as few objections as possible to\r\nthe proposed scheme of government, he thought it best to leave the\r\nmatter as we find it. He observed that the abolition of slavery seemed\r\nto be going on in the United States, and that the good sense of the\r\nseveral States would probably by degrees complete it. He urged on the\r\nConvention the necessity of despatching its business.\r\n\r\nCol. Mason. This infernal traffic originated in the avarice of British\r\nmerchants. The British Government constantly checked the attempts of\r\nVirginia to put a stop to it. The present question concerns not the\r\nimporting States alone, but the whole Union. The evil of having slaves\r\nwas experienced during the late war. Had slaves been treated as they\r\nmight have been by the enemy, they would have proved dangerous\r\ninstruments in their hands. But their folly dealt by the slaves as it\r\ndid by the tories. He mentioned the dangerous insurrections of the\r\nslaves in Greece and Sicily; and the instructions given by Cromwell to\r\nthe commissioners sent to Virginia, to arm the servants and slaves, in\r\ncase other means of obtaining its submission should fail. Maryland and\r\nVirginia he said had already prohibited the importation of slaves\r\nexpressly. North Carolina had done the same in substance. All this\r\nwould be in vain, if South Carolina and Georgia be at liberty to\r\nimport. The Western people are already calling out for slaves for\r\ntheir new lands; and will fill that country with slaves, if they can\r\nbe got through South Carolina and Georgia. Slavery discourages arts\r\nand manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed by slaves.\r\nThey prevent the emigration of whites, who really enrich and\r\nstrengthen a country. They produce the most pernicious effect on\r\nmanners. Every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant. They bring the\r\njudgment of Heaven on a country. As nations cannot be rewarded or\r\npunished in the next world, they must be in this. By an inevitable\r\nchain of causes and effects, Providence punishes national sins by\r\nnational calamities. He lamented that some of our Eastern brethren\r\nhad, from a lust of gain, embarked in the nefarious traffic. As to the\r\nStates being in possession of the right to import, this was the case\r\nwith many other rights, now to be properly given up. He held it\r\nessential in every point of view, that the General Government should\r\nhave power to prevent the increase of slavery.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellsworth, as he had never owned a slave, could not judge of the\r\neffects of slavery on character. He said, however, that if it was to\r\nbe considered in a moral light, we ought to go further and free those\r\nalready in the country. As slaves also multiply so fast in Virginia\r\nand Maryland that it is cheaper to raise than import them, whilst in\r\nthe sickly rice swamps foreign supplies are necessary, if we go no\r\nfurther than is urged, we shall be unjust towards South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia. Let us not intermeddle. As population increases, poor\r\nlaborers will be so plenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery, in\r\ntime, will not be a speck in our country. Provision is already made in\r\nConnecticut for abolishing it. And the abolition has already taken\r\nplace in Massachusetts. As to the danger of insurrections from foreign\r\ninfluence, that will become a motive to kind treatment of the slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney. If slavery be wrong, it is justified by the example of\r\nall the world. He cited the case of Greece, Rome and other ancient\r\nStates; the sanction given by France, England, Holland and other\r\nmodern States. In all ages, one half of mankind have been slaves. If\r\nthe Southern States were let alone, they will probably of themselves\r\nstop importations. He would himself, as a citizen of South Carolina,\r\nvote for it. An attempt to take away the right, as proposed, will\r\nproduce serious objections to the Constitution, which he wished to see\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nGen. Pinckney declared it to be his firm opinion that if himself and\r\nall his colleagues were to sign the Constitution and use their\r\npersonal influence, it would be of no avail towards obtaining the\r\nassent of their constituents. South Carolina and Georgia cannot do\r\nwithout slaves. As to Virginia, she will gain by stopping the\r\nimportations. Her slaves will rise in value, and she has more than she\r\nwants. It would be unequal, to require South Carolina and Georgia, to\r\nconfederate on such unequal terms. He said the Royal assent, before\r\nthe Revolution, had never been refused to South Carolina, as to\r\nVirginia. He contended that the importation of slaves would be for the\r\ninterest of the whole Union. The more slaves, the more produce to\r\nemploy the carrying trade; the more consumption also; and the more of\r\nthis, the more revenue for the common treasury. He admitted it to be\r\nreasonable that slaves should be dutied like other imports; but should\r\nconsider a rejection of the clause as an exclusion of South Carolina\r\nfrom the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin had conceived national objects alone to be before the\r\nConvention; not such as, like the present, were of a local nature.\r\nGeorgia was decided on this point. That State has always hitherto\r\nsupposed a General Government to be the pursuit of the central States,\r\nwho wished to have a vortex for every thing; that her distance would\r\npreclude her, from equal advantage; and that she could not prudently\r\npurchase it by yielding national powers. From this it might be\r\nunderstood, in what light she would view an attempt to abridge one of\r\nher favorite prerogatives. If left to herself, she may probably put a\r\nstop to the evil. As one ground for this conjecture, he took notice of\r\nthe sect of ----; which he said was a respectable class of people,\r\nwho carried their ethics beyond the mere _equality of men_, extending\r\ntheir humanity to the claims of the whole animal creation.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson observed that if South Carolina and Georgia were themselves\r\ndisposed to get rid of the importation of slaves in a short time, as\r\nhad been suggested, they would never refuse to unite because the\r\nimportation might be prohibited. As the section now stands, all\r\narticles imported are to be taxed. Slaves alone are exempt. This is in\r\nfact a bounty on that article.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerry thought we had nothing to do with the conduct of the States\r\nas to slaves, but ought to be careful not to give any sanction to it.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickinson considered it as inadmissible, on every principle of\r\nhonor and safety, that the importation of slaves should be authorized\r\nto the States by the Constitution. The true question was, whether the\r\nnational happiness would be promoted or impeded by the importation;\r\nand this question ought to be left to the National Government, not to\r\nthe States particularly interested. If England and France permit\r\nslavery, slaves are, at the same time, excluded from both those\r\nkingdoms. Greece and Rome were made unhappy by their slaves. He could\r\nnot believe that the Southern States would refuse to confederate on\r\nthe account apprehended; especially as the power was not likely to be\r\nimmediately exercised by the General Government.\r\n\r\nMr. Williamson stated the law of North Carolina on the subject, to\r\nwit, that it did not directly prohibit the importation of slaves. It\r\nimposed a duty of £5 on each slave imported from Africa; £10 on each\r\nfrom elsewhere; and £50 on each from a State licensing manumission. He\r\nthought the Southern States could not be members of the Union, if the\r\nclause should be rejected; and that it was wrong to force any thing\r\ndown not absolutely necessary, and which any State must disagree to.\r\n\r\nMr. King thought the subject should be considered in a political light\r\nonly. If two states will not agree to the Constitution, as stated on\r\none side, he could affirm with equal belief, on the other, that great\r\nand equal opposition would be experienced from the other States. He\r\nremarked on the exemption of slaves from duty, whilst every other\r\nimport was subjected to it, as an inequality that could not fail to\r\nstrike the commercial sagacity of the Northern and Middle States.\r\n\r\nMr. Langdon was strenuous for giving the power to the General\r\nGovernment. He could not, with a good conscience, have it with the\r\nStates, who could then go on with the traffic, without being\r\nrestrained by the opinions here given, that they will themselves cease\r\nto import slaves.\r\n\r\nGen. Pinckney thought himself bound to declare candidly, that he did\r\nnot think South Carolina would stop her importations of slaves, in any\r\nshort time; but only stop them occasionally as she now does. He moved\r\nto commit the clause, that slaves might be made liable to an equal tax\r\nwith other imports; which he thought right, and which would remove one\r\ndifficulty that had been started.\r\n\r\nMr. Rutledge. If the Convention thinks that North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia, will ever agree to the plan, unless their right\r\nto import slaves be untouched, the expectation is vain. The people of\r\nthose States will never be such fools, as to give up so important an\r\ninterest. He was strenuous against striking out the section, and\r\nseconded the motion of Gen. Pinckney for a commitment.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris wished the whole subject to be committed\r\nincluding the clauses relating to taxes on exports and to a navigation\r\nact. These things may form a bargain among the Northern and Southern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler declared that he never would agree to the power of taxing\r\nexports.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman said it was better to let the Southern States import\r\nslaves, than to part with them, if they made that a _sine qua non_. He\r\nwas opposed to a tax on slaves imported, as making the matter worse,\r\nbecause it implied they were _property_. He acknowledged that if the\r\npower of prohibiting the importation should be given to the General\r\nGovernment, that it would be exercised. He thought it would be its\r\nduty to exercise the power.\r\n\r\nMr. Read was for the commitment, provided the clause concerning taxes\r\non experts should also be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman observed that that clause had been agreed to, and\r\ntherefore could not be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph was for committing, in order that some middle ground\r\nmight, if possible, be found. He could never agree to the clause as it\r\nstands. He would sooner risk the Constitution. He dwelt on the dilemma\r\nto which the Convention was exposed. By agreeing to the clause, it\r\nwould revolt the Quakers, the Methodists, and many others in the\r\nStates having no slaves. On the other hand, two States might be lost\r\nto the Union. Let us then, he said, try the chance of a commitment.\r\n\r\nOn the question for committing the remaining part of Sections 4 and 5,\r\nof Article 7,--Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, aye--7; New Hampshire,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, no--3; Massachusetts absent. p. 1390-97.\r\nFriday, August 24, 1787.\r\n\r\n_In Convention_,--Governor Livingston, from the committee of eleven,\r\nto whom were referred the two remaining clauses of the fourth section,\r\nand the fifth and sixth sections, of the seventh Article, delivered in\r\nthe following Report:\r\n\r\n\"Strike out so much of the fourth section as was referred to the\r\nCommittee, and insert, 'The migration or importation of such persons\r\nas the several States, now existing, shall think proper to admit,\r\nshall not be prohibited by the Legislature prior to the year 1800; but\r\na tax or duty may be imposed on such migration or importation, at a\r\nrate not exceeding the average of the duties laid on imports.'\r\n\r\n\"The fifth Section to remain as in the Report.\r\n\r\n\"The sixth Section[4] to be stricken out.\" p. 1415.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This sixth Section was, \"No Navigation act shall be passed\r\nwithout the assent of two-thirds of the members present in each\r\nHouse.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday, August 25, 1787.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Committee of eleven (see Friday, the twenty-fourth)\r\nbeing taken up,--\r\n\r\nGen. Pinckney moved to strike out the words, \"the year eighteen\r\nhundred,\" as the year limiting the importation of slaves; and to\r\ninsert the words, \"the year eighteen hundred and eight.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gorham seconded the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison. Twenty years will produce all the mischief that can be\r\napprehended from the liberty to import slaves. So long a term will be\r\nmore dishonorable to the American character, than to say nothing about\r\nit in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the motion, which passed in the affirmative,--New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, aye--7; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, no--4.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris was for making the clause read at once, \"the\r\nimportation of slaves in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,\r\nshall not be prohibited, &c.\" This he said, would be most fair, and\r\nwould avoid the ambiguity by which, under the power with regard to\r\nnaturalization, the liberty reserved to the States might be defeated.\r\nHe wished it to be known, also, that this part of the Constitution was\r\na compliance with those States. If the change of language, however,\r\nshould be objected to, by the members from those States, he should not\r\nurge it.\r\n\r\nCol. Mason was not against using the term \"slaves,\" but against naming\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, lest it should give\r\noffence to the people of those States.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman liked a description better than the terms proposed, which\r\nhad been declined by the old Congress, and were not pleasing to some\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nM. Clymer concurred with Mr. Sherman.\r\n\r\nMr. Williamson said, that both in opinion and practice he was against\r\nslavery; but thought it more in favor of humanity, from a view of all\r\ncircumstances, to let in South Carolina and Georgia on those terms,\r\nthan to exclude them from the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris withdrew his motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickinson wished the clause to be confined to the States which had\r\nnot themselves prohibited the importation of slaves; and for that\r\npurpose moved to amend the clause, so as to read: \"The importation of\r\nslaves into such of the States as shall permit the same, shall not be\r\nprohibited by the Legislature of the United States, until the year\r\n1808;\" which was disagreed to, _nem. con._[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: In the printed Journals, Connecticut, Virginia, and\r\nGeorgia, voted in the affirmative.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first part of the Report was then agreed to, amended as follows:\r\n\"The migration or importation of such persons as the several States\r\nnow existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by\r\nthe Legislature prior to the year 1808,\"--\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, aye--7; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nVirginia, no--4.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin, in order to restrain and more explicitly define, \"the\r\naverage duty,\" moved to strike out of the second part the words,\r\n\"average of the duties and on imports,\" and insert \"common impost on\r\narticles not enumerated;\" which was agreed to, _nem. con._\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman was against this second part, as acknowledging men to be\r\nproperty, by taxing them as such under the character of slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. King and Mr. Langdon considered this as the price of the first\r\npart.\r\n\r\nGen. Pinckney admitted that it was so.\r\n\r\nCol. Mason. Not to tax, will be equivalent to a bounty on, the\r\nimportation of slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Gorham thought that Mr. Sherman should consider the duty, not as\r\nimplying that slaves are property, but as a discouragement to the\r\nimportation of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris remarked, that, as the clause now stands, it\r\nimplies that the Legislature may tax freemen imported.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman, in answer to Mr. Gorham, observed, that the smallness of\r\nthe duty showed revenue to be the object, not the discouragement of\r\nthe importation.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea\r\nthat there could be property in men. The reason of duties did not\r\nhold, as slaves are not, like merchandise, consumed, &c.\r\n\r\nCol. Mason, in answer to Mr. Gouverneur Morris. The provision as it\r\nstands, was necessary for the case of convicts; in order to prevent\r\nthe introduction of them.\r\n\r\nIt was finally agreed, _nem. con_., to make the clause read: \"but a\r\ntax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten\r\ndollars for each person;\" and then the second part, as amended, was\r\nagreed to. _pp_. 1427 to 30.\r\n\r\nTuesday, August 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 14, was then taken up.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pinckney was not satisfied with it. He seemed to wish some\r\nprovision should be included in favor of property in slaves.\r\n\r\nOn the question on Article 14,--\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, aye--9; South Carolina,\r\nno--1; Georgia, divided.\r\n\r\nArticle 15, being then taken up, the words, \"high misdemeanor,\" were\r\nstruck out, and the words, \"other crime,\" inserted, in order to\r\ncomprehend all proper cases; it being doubtful whether \"high\r\nmisdemeanor\" had not a technical meaning too limited.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler and Mr. Pinckney moved to require \"fugitive slaves and\r\nservants to be delivered up like criminals.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson. This would oblige the Executive of the State to do it, at\r\nthe public expense.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman saw no more propriety in the public seizing and\r\nsurrendering a slave or servant, than a horse.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler withdrew his proposition, in order that some particular\r\nprovision might be made, apart from this article.\r\n\r\nArticle 15, as amended, was then agreed to, _nem. con_. _pp_. 1447-8.\r\n\r\nWednesday, August 29, 1787.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pinckney said it was the true interest of the Southern States\r\nto have no regulation of commerce; but considering the loss brought on\r\nthe commerce of the Eastern States by the Revolution, their liberal\r\nconduct towards the views[6] of South Carolina, and the interest the\r\nweak Southern States had in being united with the strong Eastern\r\nStates, he thought it proper that no fetters should be imposed on the\r\npower of making commercial regulations, and that his constituents,\r\nthough prejudiced against the Eastern States, would be reconciled to\r\nthis liberality. He had, himself, he said, prejudices against the\r\nEastern States before he came here, but would acknowledge that he had\r\nfound them as liberal and candid as any men whatever. _p_. 1451.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: He meant the permission to import slaves. An understanding\r\non the two subjects of _navigation_ and _slavery_, had taken place\r\nbetween those parts of the Union, which explains the vote on the\r\nmotion depending, as well as the language of General Pinckney and\r\nothers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Butler moved to insert after Article 15, \"If any person bound to\r\nservice or labor in any of the United States, shall escape into\r\nanother State, he or she shall not be discharged from such service or\r\nlabor, in consequence of any regulations subsisting in the State to\r\nwhich they escape, but shall be delivered up to the person justly\r\nclaiming their service or labor,\"--which was agreed to, _nem. con_.\r\n_p_. 1456.\r\n\r\nMonday, September 10, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Rutledge said he never could agree to give a power by which the\r\narticles relating to slaves might be altered by the States not\r\ninterested in that property, and prejudiced against it. In order to\r\nobviate this objection, these words were added to the proposition:\r\n\"provided that no amendments, which may be made prior to the year 1808\r\nshall in any manner affect the fourth and fifth sections of the\r\nseventh Article.\" _p_. 1536.\r\n\r\nThursday, September 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 1, Section 2. On motion of Mr. Randolph, the word \"servitude\"\r\nwas struck out, and \"service\" unanimously[7] inserted, the former\r\nbeing thought to express the condition of slaves, and the latter the\r\nobligations of free persons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See page 372 of the printed journal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Dickinson and Mr. Wilson moved to strike out, \"and direct taxes,\"\r\nfrom Article 1, Section 2, as improperly placed in a clause relating\r\nmerely to the Constitution of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris. The insertion here was in consequence of what\r\nhad passed on this point; in order to exclude the appearance of\r\ncounting the negroes in the _representation_. The including of them\r\nmay now be referred to the object of direct taxes, and incidentally\r\nonly to that representation.\r\n\r\nOn the motion to strike out, \"and direct taxes,\" from this place,--New\r\nJersey, Delaware, Maryland, aye--3; New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, no--8. _pp_. 1569-70.\r\n\r\nSaturday, September 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 4, Section 2, (the third paragraph,) the term \"legally\" was\r\nstruck out; and the words, \"under the laws thereof,\" inserted after\r\nthe word \"State,\" in compliance with the wish of some who thought the\r\nterm _legal_ equivocal, and favoring the idea that slavery was legal\r\nin a moral view. _p_. 1589.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerry stated the objections which determined him to withhold his\r\nname from the Constitution: 1--2--3--4--5--6, that three fifths of\r\nthe blacks are to be represented, as if they were freemen. _p_. 1595.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nLIST OF MEMBERS\r\n\r\nOF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION WHO FORMED THE CONSTITUTION OF\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n   From                                                 Attended.\r\nNew Hampshire,    1 John Langdon,                       July 23, 1787.\r\n                    _John Pickering,_\r\n                  2 Nicholas Gilman,                       \" 23.\r\n                    _Benjamin West_.\r\nMassachusetts,      _Francis Dana_,\r\n                    Elbridge Gerry,                      May 29.\r\n                  3 Nath'l Gorham,                        \"  25.\r\n                  4 Rufus King,                           \"  25.\r\n                    Caleb Strong,                         \"  28.\r\nRhode Island,       (No appointment.)\r\nConnecticut,      5 W.S.

As the system was reported by the committee of detail, the\r\nprovision was general, that such importation should not be prohibited,\r\nwithout confining it to any particular period. This was rejected by\r\neight States--Georgia, South Carolina, and, I think, North Carolina,\r\nvoting for it.\r\n\r\nWe were then told by the delegates of the two first of those states,\r\nthat their states would never agree to a system, which put it in the\r\npower of the general government to prevent the importation of slaves,\r\nand that they, as delegates from those states, must withhold their\r\nassent from such a system.\r\n\r\nA committee of one member from each State was chosen by ballot, to\r\ntake this part of the system under their consideration, and to\r\nendeavor to agree upon some report, which should reconcile those\r\nStates. To this committee also was referred the following proposition,\r\nwhich had been reported by the committee of detail, to wit: \"No\r\nnavigation act shall be passed without the assent of two-thirds of the\r\nmembers present in each house;\" a proposition which the staple and\r\ncommercial States were solicitous to retain, lest their commerce\r\nshould be placed too much under the power of the Eastern States; but\r\nwhich these last States were as anxious to reject. This committee, of\r\nwhich also I had the honor to be a member, met and took under their\r\nconsideration the subjects committed to them. I found the _eastern_\r\nStates, notwithstanding their _aversion to slavery_, were very willing\r\nto indulge the southern States, at least with a temporary liberty to\r\nprosecute the _slave trade_, provided the southern states would in\r\ntheir turn gratify them, by laying no restriction on navigation acts;\r\nand after a very little time, the committee, by a great majority,\r\nagreed on a report, by which the general government was to be\r\nprohibited from preventing the importation of slaves for a limited\r\ntime, and the restricted clause relative to navigation acts was to be\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\nThis report was adopted by a majority of the Convention, but not\r\nwithout considerable opposition.\r\n\r\nIt was said, we had just assumed a place among independent nations in\r\nconsequence of our opposition to the attempts of Great Britain to\r\n_enslave us_; that this opposition was grounded upon the preservation\r\nof those, rights to which God and nature had entitled us, not in\r\n_particular_, but in _common_ with all the rest of mankind; that we\r\nhad appealed to the Supreme Being for his assistance, as the God of\r\nfreedom, who could not but approve our efforts to preserve the\r\n_rights_ which he had thus imparted to his creatures; that now, when\r\nwe had scarcely risen from our knees, from supplicating his mercy and\r\nprotection in forming our government over a free people, a government\r\nformed pretendedly on the principles of liberty, and for its\r\npreservation,--in that government to have a provision not only\r\nputting it out of its power to restrain and prevent the slave trade,\r\neven encouraging that most infamous traffic, by giving the States the\r\npower and influence in the Union in proportion as they cruelly and\r\nwantonly sported with the rights of their fellow-creatures, ought to\r\nbe considered as a solemn mockery of, and an insult to, that God whose\r\nprotection we had then implored, and could not fail to hold us up in\r\ndetestation, and render us contemptible to every true friend of\r\nliberty in the world. It was said, it ought to be considered that\r\nnational crimes can only be, and frequently are, punished in this\r\nworld by national punishments; and that the continuance of the slave\r\ntrade, and thus giving it a national sanction, and encouragement,\r\nought to be considered as justly exposing us to the displeasure and\r\nvengeance of him who is equally Lord of all, and who views with equal\r\neye the poor African slave and his American master!\r\n\r\nIt was urged that by this system, we were giving the general\r\ngovernment full and absolute power to regulate commerce, under which\r\ngeneral power it would have a right to restrain, or totally prohibit,\r\nthe slave trade: it must, therefore, appear to the world absurd and\r\ndisgraceful to the last degree, that we should except from the\r\nexercise of that power, the only branch of commerce which is\r\nunjustifiable in its nature, and contrary to the rights of mankind.\r\nThat, on the contrary, we ought rather to prohibit expressly in our\r\nConstitution, the further importation of slaves, and to authorize the\r\ngeneral government, from time to time, to make such regulations as\r\nshould be thought most advantageous for the gradual abolition of\r\nslavery, and the emancipation of the slaves which are already in the\r\nStates. That slavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism\r\nand has a tendency to destroy those principles on which it is\r\nsupported, as it lessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind, and\r\nhabituates us to tyranny and oppression. It was further urged, that,\r\nby this system of government, every State is to be protected both from\r\nforeign invasion and from domestic insurrections; from this\r\nconsideration, it was of the utmost importance it should have a power\r\nto restrain the importation of slaves, since, in proportion as the\r\nnumber of slaves are increased in any State, in the same proportion\r\nthe State is weakened and exposed to foreign invasion or domestic\r\ninsurrection, and by so much less will it be able to protect itself\r\nagainst either, and therefore will by so the much want aid from, and\r\nbe a burden to, the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was further said, that, as in this system we were giving the\r\ngeneral government a power, under the idea of national character, or\r\nnational interest, to regulate even our weights and measures, and have\r\nprohibited all possibility of emitting paper money, and passing\r\ninsolvent laws, &c., it must appear still more extraordinary, that we\r\nshould prohibit the government from interfering with the slave trade,\r\nthan which nothing could so materially affect both our national honor\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nThese reasons influenced me, both on the committee and in convention,\r\nmost decidedly to oppose and vote against the clause, as it now makes\r\npart of the system.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, sir, not only that the general government is\r\nprohibited from interfering in the slave-trade before the year\r\neighteen hundred and eight, but that there is no provision in the\r\nConstitution that it shall afterwards be prohibited, nor any security\r\nthat such prohibition will ever take place; and I think there is great\r\nreason to believe, that, if the importation of slaves is permitted\r\nuntil the year eighteen hundred and eight, it will not be prohibited\r\nafterwards. At this time, we do not generally hold this commerce in so\r\ngreat abhorrence as we have done. When our liberties were at stake, we\r\nwarmly felt for the common rights of men. The danger being thought to\r\nbe past, which threatened ourselves, we are daily growing more\r\ninsensible to those rights. In those States which have restrained or\r\nprohibited the importation of slaves, it is only done by legislative\r\nacts, which may be repealed. When those States find that they must, in\r\ntheir national character and connexion, suffer in the disgrace, and\r\nshare in the inconveniences attendant upon that detestable and\r\niniquitous traffic, they may be desirous also to share in the benefits\r\narising from it; and the odium attending it will be greatly effaced by\r\nthe sanction which is given to it in the general government.\r\n\r\nBy the next paragraph, the general government is to have a power of\r\nsuspending the _habeas corpus act_, in cases of _rebellion_ or\r\n_invasion_.\r\n\r\nAs the State governments have a power of suspending the habeas corpus\r\nact in those cases, it was said, there could be no reason for giving\r\nsuch a power to the general government; since, whenever the State\r\nwhich is invaded, or in which an insurrection takes place, finds its\r\nsafety requires it, it will make use of that power. And it was urged,\r\nthat if we gave this power to the general government, it would be an\r\nengine of oppression in its hands; since whenever a State should\r\noppose its views, however arbitrary and unconstitutional, and refuse\r\nsubmission to them, the general government may declare it to be an act\r\nof rebellion, and, suspending the habeas corpus act, may seize upon\r\nthe persons of those advocates of freedom, who have had virtue and\r\nresolution enough to excite the opposition, and may imprison them\r\nduring its pleasure in the remotest part of the Union; so that a\r\ncitizen of Georgia might be _bastiled_ in the furthest part of New\r\nHampshire; or a citizen of New Hampshire in the furthest extreme of\r\nthe South, cut off from their family, their friends, and their every\r\nconnexion. These considerations induced me, sir, to give my negative\r\nalso to this clause.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM DEBATES IN THE SEVERAL STATE CONVENTIONS ON THE ADOPTION\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES' CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe third paragraph of the 2d section being read,\r\n\r\nMr. King rose to explain it. There has, says he, been much\r\nmisconception of this section. It is a principle of this Constitution,\r\nthat representation and taxation should go hand in hand. This\r\nparagraph states, that the numbers of free persons shall be\r\ndetermined, by adding to the whole number of free persons, including\r\nthose bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not\r\ntaxed, three-fifths of all other persons. These persons are the\r\nslaves. By this rule is representation and taxation to be apportioned.\r\nAnd it was adopted, because it was the language of all America.\r\n\r\nMr. Widgery asked, if a boy of six years of age was to be considered\r\nas a free person?\r\n\r\nMr. King in answer said, all persons born free were to be considered\r\nas freemen; and to make the idea of _taxation by numbers_ more\r\nintelligible, said that five negro children of South Carolina, are to\r\npay as much tax as the three Governors of New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, and Connecticut.\r\n\r\nMr. Gorham thought the proposed section much in favor of Massachusetts;\r\nand if it operated against any state, it was Pennsylvania, because\r\nthey have more white persons _bound_ than any other.\r\n\r\nJudge Dana, in reply to the remark of some gentlemen, that the\r\nsouthern States were favored in this mode of apportionment, by having\r\nfive of their negroes set against three persons in the eastern, the\r\nhonorable judge observed, that the negroes of the southern States work\r\nno longer than when the eye of the driver is on them. Can, asked he,\r\nthat land flourish like this, which is cultivated by the hands of\r\nfreemen? Are not _three_ of these independent freemen of more real\r\nadvantage to a State, than _five_ of those poor slaves?\r\n\r\nMr. Nasson remarked on the statement of the honorable Mr. King, by\r\nsaying that the honorable gentleman should have gone further, and\r\nshown us the other side of the question. It is a good rule that works\r\nboth ways--and the gentlemen should also have told us, that three of\r\nour infants in the cradle, are to be rated as high as five of the\r\nworking negroes of Virginia. Mr. N. adverted to a statement of Mr.\r\nKing, who had said, that five negro children of South Carolina were\r\nequally rateable as three governors of New England, and wished, he\r\nsaid, the honorable gentleman had considered this question upon the\r\nother side--as it would then appear that this State will pay as great\r\na tax for three children in the cradle, as any of the southern States\r\nwill for five hearty working negro men. He hoped, he said, while we\r\nwere making a new government, we should make it better than the old\r\none: for if we had made a bad bargain before, as had been hinted, it\r\nwas a reason why we should make a better one now.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawes said, he was sorry to hear so many objections raised against\r\nthe paragraph under consideration. He thought them wholly unfounded;\r\nthat the black inhabitants of the southern States must be considered\r\neither as slaves, and as so much property, or in the character of so\r\nmany freemen; if the former, why should they not be wholly\r\nrepresented? Our _own_ State laws and Constitution would lead us to\r\nconsider those blacks as _freemen_, and so indeed would our own ideas\r\nof natural justice: if, then, they are freemen, they might form an\r\nequal basis for representation as though they were all white\r\ninhabitants. In either view, therefore, he could not see that the\r\nnorthern States would suffer, but directly to the contrary. He\r\nthought, however, that gentlemen would do well to connect the passage\r\nin dispute with another article in the Constitution, that permits\r\nCongress, in the year 1808, wholly to prohibit the importation of\r\nslaves, and in the mean time to impose a duty of ten dollars a head on\r\nsuch blacks as should be imported before that period. Besides, by the\r\nnew Constitution, every particular State is left to its own option\r\ntotally to prohibit the introduction of slaves into its own\r\nterritories. What could the convention do more?  The members of the\r\nsouthern States, like ourselves, have _their_ prejudices. It would\r\nnot do to abolish slavery, by an act of Congress, in a moment, and so\r\ndestroy what our southern brethren consider as property. But we may\r\nsay, that although slavery is not smitten by an apoplexy, yet it has\r\nreceived a mortal wound and will die of a consumption.\r\n\r\nMr. Neal (from Kittery,) went over the ground of objection to this\r\nsection on the idea that the slave trade was allowed to be continued\r\nfor 20 years. His profession, he said, obliged him to bear witness\r\nagainst any thing that should favor the making merchandise of the\r\nbodies of men, and unless his objection was removed, he could not put\r\nhis hand to the Constitution. Other gentlemen said, in addition to\r\nthis idea, that there was not even a proposition that the negroes ever\r\nshall be free, and Gen. Thompson exclaimed:\r\n\r\nMr. President, shall it be said, that after we have established our\r\nown independence and freedom, we make slaves of others?  Oh!\r\nWashington, what a name has he had!  How he has immortalized himself!\r\nbut he holds those in slavery who have a good right to be free as he\r\nhas--he is still for self; and, in my opinion, his character has sunk\r\n50 per cent.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, gentlemen said, that the step taken in this\r\narticle, towards the abolition of slavery, was one of the beauties of\r\nthe Constitution. They observed, that in the confederation there was\r\nno provision whatever for its ever being abolished; but this\r\nConstitution provides, that Congress may, after 20 years, totally\r\nannihilate the slave trade; and that, as all the States, except two,\r\nhave passed laws to this effect, it might reasonably be expected, that\r\nit would then be done. In the interim, all the States were at liberty\r\nto prohibit it.\r\n\r\nSaturday, January 26.--[The debate on the 9th section still continued\r\ndesultory--and consisted of similar objections, and answers thereto,\r\nas had before been used. Both sides deprecated the slave trade in the\r\nmost pointed terms; on one side it was pathetically lamented, by Mr.\r\nNason, Major Lusk, Mr. Neal, and others, that this Constitution\r\nprovided for the continuation of the slave trade for 20 years. On the\r\nother, the honorable Judge Dana, Mr. Adams and others, rejoiced that a\r\ndoor was now to be opened for the annihilation of this odious,\r\nabhorrent practice, in a certain time.]\r\n\r\nGen. Heath. Mr. President,--By my indisposition and absence, I have\r\nlost several important opportunities: I have lost the opportunity of\r\nexpressing my sentiments with a candid freedom, on some of the\r\nparagraphs of the system, which have lain heavy on my mind. I have\r\nlost the opportunity of expressing my warm approbation on some of the\r\nparagraphs. I have lost the opportunity of hearing those judicious,\r\nenlightening and convincing arguments, which have been advanced during\r\nthe investigation of the system. This is my misfortune, and I must\r\nbear it. The paragraph respecting the migration or importation of such\r\npersons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit,\r\n&c., is one of those considered during my absence, and I have heard\r\nnothing on the subject, save what has been mentioned this morning; but\r\nI think the gentlemen who have spoken, have carried the matter rather\r\ntoo far on both sides. I apprehend that it is not in our power to do\r\nany thing for or against those who are in slavery in the southern\r\nStates. No gentleman within these walls detests every idea of slavery\r\nmore than I do: it is generally detested by the people of this\r\nCommonwealth; and I ardently hope that the time will soon come, when\r\nour brethren in the southern States will view it as we do, and put a\r\nstop to it; but to this we have no right to compel them. Two questions\r\nnaturally arise: if we ratify the Constitution, shall we do any thing\r\nby our act to hold the blacks in slavery--or shall we become the\r\npartakers of other men's sins? I think neither of them. Each State is\r\nsovereign and independent to a certain degree, and they have a right,\r\nand will regulate their own internal affairs, as to themselves appears\r\nproper; and shall we refuse to eat, or to drink, or to be united, with\r\nthose who do not think, or act, just as we do? surely not. We are not\r\nin this case partakers of other men's sins, for in nothing do we\r\nvoluntarily encourage the slavery of our fellow-men; a restriction is\r\nlaid on the Federal Government, which could not be avoided, and a\r\nunion take place. The federal Convention went as far as they could;\r\nthe migration or importation, &c., is confined to the States, now\r\n_existing only_, new States cannot claim it. Congress, by their\r\nordinance for erecting new States, some time since, declared that the\r\nnew States shall be republican, and that there shall be no slavery in\r\nthem. But whether those in slavery in the southern States will be\r\nemancipated after the year 1808, I do not pretend to determine: I\r\nrather doubt it.\r\n\r\nMr. Neal rose and said, that as the Constitution at large, was now\r\nunder consideration, he would just remark, that the article which\r\nrespected the Africans, was the one which laid on his mind--and,\r\nunless his objections to that were removed, it must, how much soever\r\nhe liked the other parts of the Constitution, be a sufficient reason\r\nfor him to give his negative to it.\r\n\r\nMajor Lusk concurred in the idea already thrown out in the debate,\r\nthat although the insertion of the amendments in the Constitution was\r\ndevoutly wished, yet he did not see any reason to suppose they ever\r\nwould be adopted. Turning from the subject of amendments, the Major\r\nentered largely into the consideration of the 9th section, and in the\r\nmost pathetic and feeling manner, described the miseries of the poor\r\nnatives of Africa, who are kidnapped and sold for slaves. With the\r\nbrightest colors he painted their happiness and ease on their native\r\nshores, and contrasted them with their wretched, miserable and unhappy\r\ncondition, in a state of slavery.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. Buckus. Much, sir, has been said about the importation of\r\nslaves into this country. I believe that, according to my capacity, no\r\nman abhors that wicked practice more than I do, and would gladly make\r\nuse of all lawful means towards the abolishing of slavery in all parts\r\nof the land. But let us consider where we are, and what we are doing.\r\nIn the articles of confederation, no provision was made to hinder the\r\nimportation of slaves into any of these States: but a door is now\r\nopened hereafter to do it; and each State is at liberty now to abolish\r\nslavery as soon as they please. And let us remember our former\r\nconnexion with Great Britain, from whom many in our land think we\r\nought not to have revolted. How did they carry on the slave trade! I\r\nknow that the Bishop of Gloucester, in an annual sermon in London, in\r\nFebruary, 1766, endeavored to justify their tyrannical claims of power\r\nover us, by casting the reproach of the slave trade upon the\r\nAmericans. But at the close of the war, the Bishop of Chester, in an\r\nannual sermon, in February, 1783, ingenuously owned, that their nation\r\nis the most deeply involved in the guilt of that trade, of any nation\r\nin the world; and also, that they have treated their slaves in the\r\nWest Indies worse than the French or Spaniards have done theirs. Thus\r\nslavery grows more and more odious through the world; and, as an\r\nhonorable gentleman said some days ago, \"Though we cannot say that\r\nslavery is struck with an apoplexy, yet we may hope it will die with a\r\nconsumption.\" And a main source, sir, of that iniquity, hath been an\r\nabuse of the covenant of circumcision, which gave the seed of Abraham\r\nto destroy the inhabitants of Canaan, and to take their houses,\r\nvineyards, and all their estates, as their own; and also to buy and\r\nhold others as servants. And as Christian privileges are greater than\r\nthose of the Hebrews were, many have imagined that they had a right to\r\nseize upon the lands of the heathen, and to destroy or enslave them as\r\nfar as they could extend their power. And from thence the mystery of\r\niniquity, carried many into the practice of making merchandise of\r\nslaves and souls of men. But all ought to remember, that when God\r\npromised the land of Canaan to Abraham and his seed, he let him know\r\nthat they were not to take possession of that land, until the iniquity\r\nof the Amorites was full; and then they did it under the immediate\r\ndirection of Heaven; and they were as real executors of the judgment\r\nof God upon those heathens, as any person ever was an executor of a\r\ncriminal justly condemned. And in doing it they were not allowed to\r\ninvade the lands of the Edomites, who sprang from Esau, who was not\r\nonly of the seed of Abraham, but was born at the same birth with\r\nIsrael; and yet they were not of that church. Neither were Israel\r\nallowed to invade the lands of the Moabites, or of the children of\r\nAmmon, who were of the seed of Lot. And no officer in Israel had any\r\nlegislative power, but such as were immediately inspired. Even David,\r\nthe man after God's own heart, had no legislative power, but only as\r\nhe was inspired from above: and he is expressly called a _prophet_ in\r\nthe New Testament. And we are to remember that Abraham and his seed,\r\nfor four hundred years, had no warrant to admit any strangers into\r\nthat church, but by buying of him as a servant, with money. And it was\r\na great privilege to be bought, and adopted into a religious family\r\nfor seven years, and then to have their freedom. And that covenant was\r\nexpressly repealed in various parts of the New Testament; and\r\nparticularly in the first epistle to the Corinthians, wherein it is\r\nsaid--Ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body,\r\nand in your spirit, which are God's. And again--Circumcision is\r\nnothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping of the\r\ncommandments of God. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the\r\nservants of men. Thus the gospel sets all men upon a level, very\r\ncontrary to the declaration of an honorable gentleman in this house,\r\n\"that the Bible was contrived for the advantage of a particular order\r\nof men.\"\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith. He would now proceed to state his objections to the clause\r\njust read, (section 2, of article 1, clause 3.) His objections were\r\ncomprised under three heads: 1st, the rule of apportionment is unjust;\r\n2d, there is no precise number fixed on, below which the house shall\r\nnot be reduced; 3d, it is inadequate. In the first place, the rule of\r\napportionment of the representatives is to be according to the whole\r\nnumber of the white inhabitants, with three-fifths of all others; that\r\nis, in plain English, each State is to send representatives in\r\nproportion to the number of freemen, and three-fifths of the slaves it\r\ncontains. He could not see any rule by which slaves were to be\r\nincluded in the ratio of representation;--the principle of a\r\nrepresentation being that every free agent should be concerned in\r\ngoverning himself, it was absurd to give that power to a man who could\r\nnot exercise it--slaves have no will of their own: the very operation\r\nof it was to give certain privileges to those people, who were so\r\nwicked as to keep slaves. He knew it would be admitted, that this rule\r\nof apportionment was founded on unjust principles, but that it was the\r\nresult of accommodation; which, he supposed, we should be under the\r\nnecessity of admitting, if we meant to be in union with the southern\r\nStates, though utterly repugnant to his feelings.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton. In order that the committee may understand clearly the\r\nprinciples on which the General Convention acted, I think it necessary\r\nto explain some preliminary circumstances.\r\n\r\nSir, the natural situation of this country seems to divide its\r\ninterests into different classes. There are navigating and\r\nnon-navigating States--the Northern are properly the navigating\r\nStates: the Southern appear to possess neither the means; nor the\r\nspirit of navigation. This difference of situation naturally produces\r\na dissimilarity of interest and views respecting foreign commerce. It\r\nwas the interest of the Northern States that there should be no\r\nrestraints on their navigation, and that they should leave full power,\r\nby a majority in Congress, to make commercial regulations in favor of\r\ntheir own, and in restraint of the navigation of foreigners. The\r\nSouthern States wished to impose a restraint on the Northern, by\r\nrequiring that two-thirds in Congress should be requisite to pass an\r\nact in regulation of commerce: they were apprehensive that the\r\nrestraints of a navigation law would discourage foreigners, and by\r\nobliging them to employ the shipping of the Northern States would\r\nprobably enhance their freight. This being the case, they insisted\r\nstrenuously on having this provision engrafted in the constitution;\r\nand the Northern States were as anxious in opposing it. On the other\r\nhand, the small States seeing themselves embraced by the confederation\r\nupon equal terms, wished to retain the advantages which they already\r\npossessed: the large States, on the contrary, thought it improper that\r\nRhode Island and Delaware should enjoy an equal suffrage with\r\nthemselves: from these sources a delicate and difficult contest arose.\r\nIt became necessary, therefore, to compromise; or the Convention must\r\nhave dissolved without effecting any thing. Would it have been wise\r\nand prudent in that body, in this critical situation, to have deserted\r\ntheir country? No. Every man who hears me--every wise man in the\r\nUnited States, would have condemned them. The Convention were obliged\r\nto appoint a committee for accommodation. In this committee the\r\narrangement was formed as it now stands; and their report was\r\naccepted. It was a delicate point; and it was necessary that all\r\nparties should be indulged. Gentlemen will see, that if there had not\r\nbeen a unanimity, nothing could have been done: for the Convention had\r\nno power to establish, but only to recommend a government. Any other\r\nsystem would have been impracticable. Let a Convention be called\r\nto-morrow--let them meet twenty times; nay, twenty thousand times;\r\nthey will have the same difficulties to encounter; the same clashing\r\ninterests to reconcile.\r\n\r\nBut dismissing these reflections, let us consider how far the\r\narrangement is in itself entitled to the approbation of this body. We\r\nwill examine it upon its own merits.\r\n\r\nThe first thing objected to, is that clause which allows a\r\nrepresentation for three-fifths of the negroes. Much has been said of\r\nthe impropriety of representing men, who have no will of their own.\r\nWhether this be reasoning or declamation, I will not presume to say.\r\nIt is the unfortunate situation of the southern states, to have a\r\ngreat part of their population, as well as property, in blacks. The\r\nregulations complained of was one result of the spirit of\r\naccommodation, which governed the convention; and without this\r\nindulgence, no union could possibly have been formed. But, sir,\r\nconsidering some peculiar advantages which we derived from them, it is\r\nentirely just that they should be gratified. The southern states\r\npossess certain staples, tobacco, rice, indigo, &c., which must be\r\ncapital objects in treaties of commerce with foreign nations; and the\r\nadvantage which they necessarily procure in these treaties will be\r\nfelt throughout all the states. But the justice of this plan will\r\nappear in another view. The best writers on government have held that\r\nrepresentation should be compounded of persons and property. This rule\r\nhas been adopted, as far as it could be, in the Constitution of\r\nNew-York. It will, however, by no means, be admitted, that the slaves\r\nare considered altogether as property. They are men, though degraded\r\nto the condition of slavery. They are persons known to the municipal\r\nlaws of the states which they inhabit as well as to the laws of\r\nnature. But representation and taxation go together--and one uniform\r\nrule ought to apply to both. Would it be just to compute these slaves\r\nin the assessment of taxes, and discard them from the estimate in the\r\napportionment of representatives? Would it be just to impose a\r\nsingular burthen, without conferring some adequate advantage?\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance ought to be considered. The rule we have been\r\nspeaking of is a general rule, and applies to all the states. Now, you\r\nhave a great number of people in your state, which are not represented\r\nat all; and have no voice in your government; these will be included\r\nin the enumeration--not two-fifths--nor three-fifths, but the whole.\r\nThis proves that the advantages of the plan are not confined to the\r\nsouthern states, but extend to other parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. M. Smith. I shall make no reply to the arguments offered by the\r\nhon. gentleman to justify the rule of apportionment fixed by this\r\nclause: for though I am confident they might be easily refuted, yet I\r\nam persuaded we must yield this point, in accommodation to the\r\nsouthern states. The amendment therefore proposes no alteration to\r\nthe clause in this respect.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison. Among the objections, that, which has been made to the\r\nmode of apportionment of representatives, has been relinquished. I\r\nthink this concession does honor to the gentleman who had stated the\r\nobjection. He has candidly acknowledged, that this apportionment was\r\nthe result of accommodation; without which no union could have been\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson. Much fault has been found with the mode of expression,\r\nused in the first clause of the ninth section of the first article. I\r\nbelieve I can assign a reason, why that mode of expression was used,\r\nand why the term slave was not admitted in this constitution--and as\r\nto the manner of laying taxes, this is not the first time that the\r\nsubject has come into the view of the United States, and of the\r\nlegislatures of the several states. The gentleman, (Mr. Findley) will\r\nrecollect, that in the present congress, the quota of the federal\r\ndebt, and general expenses, was to be in proportion to the value of\r\nland, and other enumerated property, within the states. After trying\r\nthis for a number of years, it was found on all hands, to be a mode\r\nthat could not be carried into execution. Congress were satisfied of\r\nthis, and in the year 1783 recommended, in conformity with the powers\r\nthey possessed under the articles of confederation, that the quota\r\nshould be according to the number of free people, including those\r\nbound to servitude, and excluding Indians not taxed. These were the\r\nexpressions used in 1783, and the fate of this recommendation was\r\nsimilar to all their other resolutions. It was not carried into\r\neffect, but it was adopted by no fewer than eleven, out of thirteen\r\nstates; and it cannot but be matter of surprise, to hear gentlemen,\r\nwho agreed to this very mode of expression at that time, come forward\r\nand state it as an objection on the present occasion. It was natural,\r\nsir, for the late convention, to adopt the mode after it had been\r\nagreed to by eleven states, and to use the expression, which they\r\nfound had been received as unexceptional before. With respect to the\r\nclause, restricting congress from prohibiting the migration or\r\nimportation of such persons, as any of the states now existing, shall\r\nthink proper to admit, prior to the year 1808. The honorable gentleman\r\nsays, that this cause is not only dark, but intended to grant to\r\ncongress, for that time, the power to admit the importation of slaves.\r\nNo such thing was intended; but I will tell you what was done, and it\r\ngives me high pleasure, that so much was done. Under the present\r\nconfederation, the states may admit the importation of slaves as long\r\nas they please; but by this article, after the year 1808 the congress\r\nwill have power to prohibit such importation, notwithstanding the\r\ndisposition of any state to the contrary. I consider this as laying\r\nthe foundation for banishing slavery out of this country; and though\r\nthe period is more distant than I could wish, yet it will produce the\r\nsame kind, gradual change, which was pursued in Pennsylvania. It is\r\nwith much satisfaction I view this power in the general government,\r\nwhereby they may lay an interdiction on this reproachful trade; but an\r\nimmediate advantage is also obtained, for a tax or duty may be imposed\r\non such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person; and\r\nthis, sir, operates as a partial prohibition; it was all that could be\r\nobtained, I am sorry it was no more; but from this I think there is\r\nreason to hope, that yet a few years, and it will be prohibited\r\naltogether; and in the mean time, the new states which are to be\r\nformed, will be under the control of congress in this particular; and\r\nslaves will never be introduced amongst them. The gentleman says, that\r\nit is unfortunate in another point of view; it means to prohibit the\r\nintroduction of white people from Europe, as this tax may deter them\r\nfrom coming amongst us; a little impartiality and attention will\r\ndiscover the care that the convention took in selecting their\r\nlanguage. The words are the _migration_ or IMPORTATION of such\r\npersons, &c., shall not be prohibited by congress prior to the year\r\n1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation; it is\r\nobservable here, that the term migration is dropped, when a tax or\r\nduty is mentioned, so that congress have power to impose the tax only\r\non those imported.\r\n\r\nI recollect, on a former day, the honorable gentleman from\r\nWestmoreland (Mr. Findley) and the honorable gentleman from Cumberland\r\n(Mr. Whitehill,) took exception against the first clause of the 9th\r\nsection, art. 1, arguing very unfairly, that because congress might\r\nimpose a tax or duty of ten dollars on the importation of slaves,\r\nwithin any of the United States, congress might therefore permit\r\nslaves to be imported within this state, contrary to its laws. I\r\nconfess I little thought that this part of the system would be\r\nexcepted to.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that it could be extended no further; but so far as it\r\noperates, it presents us with the pleasing prospect, that the rights\r\nof mankind will be acknowledged and established throughout the union.\r\n\r\nIf there was no other lovely feature in the constitution but this one,\r\nit would diffuse a beauty over its whole countenance. Yet the lapse of\r\na few years! and congress will have power to exterminate slavery from\r\nwithin our borders.\r\n\r\nHow would such a delightful prospect expand the breast of a benevolent\r\nand philanthropic European? Would he cavil at an expression? catch at\r\na phrase? No, sir, that is only reserved for the gentleman on the\r\nother side of your chair to do.\r\n\r\nMr. McKean. The arguments against the constitution are, I think,\r\nchiefly these: ...\r\n\r\nThat migration or importation of such persons, as any of the states\r\nshall admit, shall not be prohibited prior to 1808, nor a tax or duty\r\nimposed on such importation exceeding ten dollars for each person.\r\n\r\nProvision is made that congress shall have power to prohibit the\r\nimportation of slaves after the year 1808, but the gentlemen in\r\nopposition, accuse this system of a crime, because it has not\r\nprohibited them at once. I suspect those gentlemen are not well\r\nacquainted with the business of the diplomatic body, or they would\r\nknow that an agreement might be made, that did not perfectly accord\r\nwith the will and pleasure of any one person. Instead of finding fault\r\nwith what has been gained, I am happy to see a disposition in the\r\nUnited States to do so much.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nGov Randolph said, we are told in strong language, of dangers to which\r\nwe will be exposed unless we adopt this Constitution. Among the rest,\r\ndomestic safety is said to be in danger. This government does not\r\nattend to our domestic safety. It authorizes the importation of slaves\r\nfor twenty-odd years, and thus continues upon us that nefarious trade.\r\nInstead of securing and protecting us, the continuation of this\r\ndetestable trade adds daily to our weakness. Though this evil is\r\nincreasing, there is no clause in the Constitution that will prevent\r\nthe northern and eastern States from meddling with our whole property\r\nof that kind. There is a clause to prohibit the importation of slaves\r\nafter twenty years, but there is no provision made for securing to the\r\nsouthern States those they now possess. It is far from being a\r\ndesirable property. But it will involve us in great difficulties and\r\ninfelicity to be now deprived of them. There ought to be a clause in\r\nthe Constitution to secure us that property, which we have acquired\r\nunder our former laws, and the loss of which would bring ruin on a\r\ngreat many people.\r\n\r\nMr. Lee. The honorable gentleman abominates it, because it does not\r\nprohibit the importation of slaves, and because it does not secure the\r\ncontinuance of the existing slavery! Is it not obviously inconsistent\r\nto criminate it for two contradictory reasons? I submit it to the\r\nconsideration of the gentleman, whether, if it be reprehensible in the\r\none case, it can be censurable in the other? Mr. Lee then concluded by\r\nearnestly recommending to the committee to proceed regularly.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry. It says, that \"no state shall engage in war, unless\r\nactually invaded.\" If you give this clause a fair construction, what\r\nis the true meaning of it? What does this relate to? Not domestic\r\ninsurrections, but war. If the country be invaded, a state may go to\r\nwar; but cannot suppress insurrections. If there should happen an\r\ninsurrection of slaves, the country cannot be said to be\r\ninvaded.--They cannot therefore suppress it, without the interposition\r\nof congress.\r\n\r\nMr. George Nicholas said, another worthy member says, there is no\r\npower in the States to quell an insurrection of slaves. Have they it\r\nnow? If they have, does the Constitution take it away? If it does, it\r\nmust be in one of the three clauses which have been mentioned by the\r\nworthy member. The first clause gives the general government power to\r\ncall them out when necessary. Does this take it away from the States?\r\nNo. But it gives an additional security: for, besides the power in the\r\nState governments to use their own militia, it will be the duty of the\r\ngeneral government to aid them with the strength of the Union when\r\ncalled for. No part of the Constitution can show that this power is\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nMr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, this is a fatal section, which has\r\ncreated more dangers than any other. The first clause allows the\r\nimportation of slaves for twenty years. Under the royal government,\r\nthis evil was looked upon as a great oppression, and many attempts\r\nwere made to prevent it; but the interest of the African merchants\r\nprevented its prohibition. No sooner did the revolution take place,\r\nthan it was thought of. It was one of the great causes of our\r\nseparation from Great Britain. Its exclusion has been a principal\r\nobject of this State, and most of the States in the Union. The\r\naugmentation of slaves weakens the States; and such a trade is\r\ndiabolical in itself, and disgraceful to mankind. Yet, by this\r\nConstitution, it is continued for twenty years. As much as I value an\r\nunion of all the States, I would not admit the Southern States into\r\nthe Union, unless they agreed to the discontinuance of this\r\ndisgraceful trade, because it would bring weakness and not strength to\r\nthe Union. And though this infamous traffic be continued, we have no\r\nsecurity for the property of that kind which we have already. There is\r\nno clause in this Constitution to secure it; for they may lay such tax\r\nas will amount to manumission. And should the government be amended,\r\nstill this detestable kind of commerce cannot be discontinued till\r\nafter the expiration of twenty years. For the fifth article, which\r\nprovides for amendments, expressly excepts this clause. I have ever\r\nlooked upon this as a most disgraceful thing to America. I cannot\r\nexpress my detestation of it. Yet they have not secured us the\r\nproperty of the slaves we have already. So that, \"they have done what\r\nthey ought not to have done, and have left undone what they ought to\r\nhave done.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Madison. Mr. Chairman, I should conceive this clause to be\r\nimpolitic, if it were one of those things which could be excluded\r\nwithout encountering greater evils. The Southern States would not have\r\nentered into the Union of America, without the temporary permission of\r\nthat trade. And if they were excluded from the Union, the consequences\r\nmight be dreadful to them and to us. We are not in a worse situation\r\nthan before. That traffic is prohibited by our laws, and we may\r\ncontinue the prohibition. The Union in general is not in a worse\r\nsituation. Under the articles of confederation, it might be continued\r\nforever: but by this clause an end may be put to it after twenty\r\nyears. There is, therefore, an amelioration of our circumstances. A\r\ntax may be laid in the mean time; but it is limited, otherwise\r\nCongress might lay such a tax as would amount to a prohibition. From\r\nthe mode of representation and taxation, Congress cannot lay such a\r\ntax on slaves as will amount to manumission. Another clause secures us\r\nthat property which we now possess. At present, if any slave elopes to\r\nany of those States where slaves are free, he becomes emancipated by\r\ntheir laws. For the laws of the States are uncharitable to one another\r\nin this respect. But in this Constitution, \"no person held to service,\r\nor labor, in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another,\r\nshall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged\r\nfrom such service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the\r\nparty to whom such service or labor may be due.\"  This clause was\r\nexpressly inserted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim them. This is\r\na better security than any that now exists. No power is given to the\r\ngeneral government to interpose with respect to the property in slaves\r\nnow held by the States. The taxation of this State being equal only to\r\nits representation, such a tax cannot be laid as he supposes. They\r\ncannot prevent the importation of slaves for twenty years; but after\r\nthat period, they can. The gentlemen from South Carolina and Georgia\r\nargued in this manner: \"We have now liberty to import this species of\r\nproperty, and much of the property now possessed, has been purchased,\r\nor otherwise acquired, in contemplation of improving it by the\r\nassistance of imported slaves. What would be the consequence of\r\nhindering us from it? The slaves of Virginia would rise in value, and\r\nwe would be obliged to go to your markets.\" I need not expatiate on\r\nthis subject. Great as the evil is, a dismemberment of the Union would\r\nbe worse. If those States should disunite from the other States, for\r\nnot including them in the temporary continuance of this traffic, they\r\nmight solicit and obtain aid from foreign powers.\r\n\r\nMr. Tyler warmly enlarged on the impolicy, iniquity, and\r\ndisgracefulness of this wicked traffic. He thought the reasons urged\r\nby gentlemen in defence of it were inconclusive, and ill founded. It\r\nwas one cause of the complaints against British tyranny, that this\r\ntrade was permitted. The Revolution had put a period to it; but now it\r\nwas to be revived. He thought nothing could justify it. This temporary\r\nrestriction on Congress militated, in his opinion, against the\r\narguments of gentlemen on the other side, that what was not given up,\r\nwas retained by the States; for that if this restriction had not been\r\ninserted, Congress could have prohibited the African trade. The power\r\nof prohibiting it was not expressly delegated to them; yet they would\r\nhave had it by implication, if this restraint had not been provided.\r\nThis seemed to him to demonstrate most clearly the necessity of\r\nrestraining them by a bill of rights, from infringing our unalienable\r\nrights. It was immaterial whether the bill of rights was by itself, or\r\nincluded in the Constitution. But he contended for it one way or the\r\nother. It would be justified by our own example, and that of England.\r\nHis earnest desire was, that it should be handed down to posterity,\r\nthat he had opposed this wicked clause.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison. As to the restriction in the clause under consideration,\r\nit was a restraint on the exercise of a power expressly delegated to\r\ncongress, namely, that of regulating commerce with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry insisted, that the insertion of these restrictions on\r\nCongress, was a plain demonstration that Congress could exercise\r\npowers by implication. The gentleman had admitted that Congress could\r\nhave interdicted the African trade, were it not for this restriction.\r\nIf so, the power not having been expressly delegated, must be obtained\r\nby implication. He demanded where, then, was their doctrine of\r\nreserved rights? He wished for negative clauses to prevent them from\r\nassuming any powers but those expressly given. He asked why it was\r\nmoited to secure us that property in slaves, which we held now? He\r\nfeared its omission was done with design. They might lay such heavy\r\ntaxes on slaves, as would amount to emancipation; and then the\r\nSouthern States would be the only sufferers. His opinion was confirmed\r\nby the mode of levying money. Congress, he observed, had power to lay\r\nand collect taxes, imposts, and excises. Imposts (or duties) and\r\nexcises, were to be uniform. But this uniformity did not extend to\r\ntaxes. This might compel the Southern States to liberate their\r\nnegroes. He wished this property therefore to be guarded. He\r\nconsidered the clause which had been adduced by the gentleman as a\r\nsecurity for this property, as no security at all. It was no more than\r\nthis--that a runaway negro could be taken up in Maryland or New-York.\r\nThis could not prevent Congress from interfering with that property by\r\nlaying a grievous and enormous tax on it, so as to compel owners to\r\nemancipate their slaves rather than pay the tax. He apprehended it\r\nwould be productive of much stock-jobbing, and that they would play\r\ninto one another's hands in such a manner as that this property would\r\nbe lost to the country.\r\n\r\nMr. George Nicholas wondered that gentlemen who were against slavery,\r\nwould be opposed to this clause; as after that period the slave trade\r\nwould be done away. He asked, if gentlemen did not see the\r\ninconsistency of their arguments? They object, says he, to the\r\nConstitution, because the slave trade is laid open for twenty-odd\r\nyears; and yet tell you, that by some latent operation of it, the\r\nslaves who are so now, will be manumitted. At the same moment, it is\r\nopposed for being promotive and destructive of slavery. He contended\r\nthat it was advantageous to Virginia, that it should be in the power\r\nof Congress to prevent the importation of slaves after twenty years,\r\nas it would then put a period to the evil complained of.\r\n\r\nAs the Southern States would not confederate without this clause, he\r\nasked, if gentlemen would rather dissolve the confederacy than to\r\nsuffer this temporary inconvenience, admitting it to be such? Virginia\r\nmight continue the prohibition of such importation during the\r\nintermediate period, and would be benefitted by it, as a tax of ten\r\ndollars on each slave might be laid, of which she would receive a\r\nshare. He endeavored to obviate the objection of gentlemen, that the\r\nrestriction on Congress was a proof that they would have power not\r\ngiven them, by remarking, that they would only have had a general\r\nsuperintendency of trade, if the restriction had not been inserted.\r\nBut the Southern States insisted on this exception to that general\r\nsuperintendency for twenty years. It could not therefore have been a\r\npower by implication, as the restriction was an exception from a\r\ndelegated power. The taxes could not, as had been suggested, be laid\r\nso high on negroes as to amount to emancipation; because taxation and\r\nrepresentation were fixed according to the census established in the\r\nConstitution. The exception of taxes, from the uniformity annexed to\r\nduties and excises, could not have the operation contended for by the\r\ngentleman; because other clauses had clearly and positively fixed the\r\ncensus. Had taxes been uniform, it would have been universally\r\nobjected to, for no one object could be selected without involving\r\ngreat inconveniences and oppressions. But, says Mr. Nicholas, is it\r\nfrom the general government we are to fear emancipation? Gentlemen\r\nwill recollect what I said in another house, and what other gentlemen\r\nhave said that advocated emancipation. Give me leave to say, that that\r\nclause is a great security for our slave tax. I can tell the\r\ncommittee, that the people of our country are reduced to beggary by\r\nthe taxes on negroes. Had this Constitution been adopted, it would not\r\nhave been the case. The taxes were laid on all our negroes. By this\r\nsystem two-fifths are exempted. He then added, that he imagined\r\ngentlemen would not support here what they had opposed in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry replied, that though the proportion of each was to be fixed\r\nby the census, and three-fifths of the slaves only were included in\r\nthe enumeration, yet the proportion of Virginia being once fixed,\r\nmight be laid on blacks and blacks only. For the mode of raising the\r\nproportion of each State being to be directed by Congress, they might\r\nmake slaves the sole object to raise it. Personalities he wished to\r\ntake leave of: they had nothing to do with the question, which was\r\nsolely whether that paper was wrong or not.\r\n\r\nMr. Nicholas replied, that negroes must he considered as persons, or\r\nproperty. If as property, the proportion of taxes to be laid on them\r\nwas fixed in the Constitution. If he apprehended a poll tax on\r\nnegroes, the Constitution had prevented it. For, by the census, where\r\na white man paid ten shillings, a negro paid but six shillings. For\r\nthe exemption of two-fifths of them reduced it to that proportion.\r\n\r\nThe second, third, and fourth clauses, were then read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,\r\nunless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may\r\nrequire it.\r\n\r\nNo bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.\r\n\r\nNo capitation or other direct tax shall be paid, unless in proportion\r\nto the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. George Mason said, that gentlemen might think themselves secured\r\nby the restriction in the fourth clause, capitation or other direct\r\ntax should he laid but in proportion to the census before directed to\r\nbe taken. But that when maturely considered it would be found to be no\r\nsecurity whatsoever. It was nothing but a direct assertion, or mere\r\nconfirmation of the clause which fixed the ratio of taxes and\r\nrepresentation. It only meant that the quantum to be raised of each\r\nState should be in proportion to their numbers in the manner therein\r\ndirected. But the general government was not precluded from laying the\r\nproportion of any particular State on any one species of property they\r\nmight think proper. For instance, if five hundred thousand dollars\r\nwere to be raised, they might lay the whole of the proportion of\r\nSouthern States on the blacks, or any one species of property: so that\r\nby laying taxes too heavily on slaves, they might totally annihilate\r\nthat kind of property. No real security could arise from the clause\r\nwhich provides, that persons held to labor in one State, escaping into\r\nanother, shall be delivered up. This only meant, that runaway slaves\r\nshould not be protected in other States. As to the exclusion of _ex\r\npost facto_ laws, it could not be said to create any security in this\r\ncase. For laying a tax on slaves would not be _ex post facto_.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison replied, that even the Southern States, who were most\r\naffected, were perfectly satisfied with this provision, and dreaded no\r\ndanger to the property they now hold. It appeared to him, that the\r\ngeneral government would not intermeddle with that property for twenty\r\nyears, but to lay a tax on every slave imported, not exceeding ten\r\ndollars; and that after the expiration of that period they might\r\nprohibit the traffic altogether. The census in the constitution was\r\nintended to introduce equality in the burdens to be laid on the\r\ncommunity. No gentleman objected to laying duties, imposts, and\r\nexcises, uniformly. But uniformity of taxes would be subversive to the\r\nprinciples of equality: for that it was not possible to select any\r\narticle which would be easy for one State, but what would be heavy for\r\nanother. That the proportion of each State being ascertained, it would\r\nbe raised by the general government in the most convenient manner for\r\nthe people, and not by the selection of any one particular object.\r\nThat there must be some decree of confidence put in agents, or else we\r\nmust reject a state of civil society altogether. Another great\r\nsecurity to this property, which he mentioned, was, that five States\r\nwere greatly interested in that species of property, and there were\r\nother States which had some slaves, and had made no attempt, or taken\r\nany step to take them from the people. There were a few slaves in New\r\nYork, New Jersey and Connecticut: these States could, probably, oppose\r\nany attempts to annihilate this species of property. He concluded, by\r\nobserving, that he would be glad to leave the decision of this to the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe second section was then read as follows:\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNo person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws\r\nthereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but\r\nshall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or\r\nlabor may be due.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. George Mason.--Mr. Chairman, on some former part of the\r\ninvestigation of this subject, gentlemen were pleased to make some\r\nobservations on the security of property coming within this section.\r\nIt was then said, and I now say, that there is no security, nor have\r\ngentlemen convinced me of this.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry. Among ten thousand implied powers which they may assume,\r\nthey may, if we be engaged in war, liberate every one of your slaves\r\nif they please. And this must and will be done by men, a majority of\r\nwhom have not a common interest with you. They will, therefore, have\r\nno feeling for your interests. It has been repeatedly said here, that\r\nthe great object of a national government, was national defence. That\r\npower which is said to be intended for security and safety, may be\r\nrendered detestable and oppressive. If you give power to the general\r\ngovernment to provide for the general defence, the means must be\r\ncommensurate to the end. All the means in the possession of the people\r\nmust be given to the government which is entrusted with the public\r\ndefence. In this State there are 236,000 blacks, and there are many in\r\nseveral other States. But there are few or none in the Northern\r\nStates, and yet if the Northern States shall be of opinion, that our\r\nnumbers are numberless, they may call forth every national resource.\r\nMay Congress not say, that every black man must fight? Did we not see\r\na little of this last war? We were not so hard pushed, as to make\r\nemancipation general. But acts of assembly passed, that every slave\r\nwho would go to the army should be free. Another thing will contribute\r\nto bring this event about--slavery is detested--we feel its fatal\r\neffects--we deplore it with all the pity of humanity. Let all these\r\nconsiderations, at some future period, press with full force on the\r\nminds of Congress. Let that urbanity, which I trust will distinguish\r\nAmerica, and the necessity of national defence, let all these things\r\noperate on their minds, they will search that paper, and see if they\r\nhave power of manumission. And have they not, sir? Have they not power\r\nto provide for the general defence and welfare? May they not think\r\nthat these call for the abolition of slavery? May not they pronounce\r\nall slaves free, and will they not be warranted by that power?  There\r\nis no ambiguous implication or logical deduction. The paper speaks to\r\nthe point. They have the power in clear, unequivocal terms; and will\r\nclearly and certainly exercise it. As much as I deplore slavery, I\r\nsee that prudence forbids its abolition. I deny that the general\r\ngovernment ought to set them free, because a decided majority of the\r\nStates have not the ties of sympathy and fellow-feeling for those\r\nwhose interest would be affected by their emancipation. The majority\r\nof Congress is to the North, and the slaves are to the South. In this\r\nsituation, I see a great deal of the property of the people of\r\nVirginia in jeopardy, and their peace and tranquillity gone away. I\r\nrepeat it again, that it would rejoice my very soul, that every one of\r\nmy fellow-beings was emancipated. As we ought with gratitude to\r\nadmire that decree of Heaven, which has numbered us among the free, we\r\nought to lament and deplore the necessity of holding our fellow-men in\r\nbondage. But is it practicable by any human means, to liberate them,\r\nwithout producing the most dreadful and ruinous consequences? We ought\r\nto possess them in the manner we have inherited them from our\r\nancestors, as their manumission is incompatible with the felicity of\r\nthe country. But we ought to soften, as much as possible, the rigor of\r\ntheir unhappy fate. I know that in a variety of particular instances,\r\nthe legislature, listening to complaints, have admitted their\r\nemancipation. Let me not dwell on this subject. I will only add, that\r\nthis, as well as every other property of the people of Virginia, is in\r\njeopardy, and put in the hands of those who have no similarity of\r\nsituation with us. This is a local matter, and I can see no propriety\r\nin subjecting it to Congress.\r\n\r\nHave we not a right to say, _hear our propositions_? Why, sir, your\r\nslaves have a right to make their humble requests.--Those who are in\r\nthe meanest occupations of human life, have a right to complain.\r\n\r\nGov. Randolph said, that honorable gentleman, and some others, have\r\ninsisted that the abolition of slavery will result from it, and at the\r\nsame time have complained, that it encourages its continuation. The\r\ninconsistency proves in some degree, the futility of their arguments.\r\nBut if it be not conclusive, to satisfy the committee that there is no\r\ndanger of enfranchisement taking place, I beg leave to refer them to\r\nthe paper itself. I hope that there is none here, who, considering the\r\nsubject in the calm light of philosophy, will advance an objection\r\ndishonorable to Virginia; that at the moment they are securing the\r\nrights of their citizens, an objection is started that there is a\r\nspark of hope, that those unfortunate men now held in bondage, may, by\r\nthe operation of the general government, be made _free_. But if any\r\ngentleman be terrified by this apprehension, let him read the system.\r\nI ask, and I will ask again and again, till I be answered (not by\r\ndeclamation) where is the part that has a tendency to the abolition of\r\nslavery? Is it the clause which says, that \"the migration or\r\nimportation of such persons as any of the States now existing, shall\r\nthink proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to\r\nthe year 1808?\" This is an exception from the power of regulating\r\ncommerce, and the restriction is only to continue till 1808. Then\r\nCongress can, by the exercise of that power, prevent future\r\nimportations; but does it affect the existing state of slavery? Were\r\nit right here to mention what passed in convention on the occasion, I\r\nmight tell you that the Southern States, even South Carolina herself,\r\nconceived this property to be secure by these words. I believe,\r\nwhatever we may think here, that there was not a member of the\r\nVirginia delegation who had the smallest suspicion of the abolition of\r\nslavery. Go to their meaning. Point out the clause where this\r\nformidable power of emancipation is inserted. But another clause of\r\nthe Constitution proves the absurdity of the supposition. The words of\r\nthe clause are, \"No person held to service or labor in our State,\r\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence\r\nof any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or\r\nlabor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\r\nservice or labor may be due.\"  Every one knows that slaves are held to\r\nservice and labor. And when authority is given to owners of slaves to\r\nvindicate their property, can it be supposed they can be deprived of\r\nit? If a citizen of this State, in consequence of this clause, can\r\ntake his runaway slave in Maryland, can it be seriously thought, that\r\nafter taking him and bringing him home, he could be made free?\r\n\r\nI observed that the honorable gentleman's proposition comes in a truly\r\nquestionable shape, and is still more extraordinary and unaccountable\r\nfor another consideration; that although we went article by article\r\nthrough the Constitution, and although we did not expect a general\r\nreview of the subject, (as a most comprehensive view had been taken of\r\nit before it was regularly debated,) yet we are carried back to the\r\nclause giving that dreadful power, for the general welfare. Pardon me\r\nif I remind you of the true state of that business. I appeal to the\r\ncandor of the honorable gentleman, and if he thinks it an improper\r\nappeal, I ask the gentlemen here, whether there be a general\r\nindefinite power of providing for the general welfare? The power is,\r\n\"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the\r\ndebts and provide for the common defence and general welfare.\" So that\r\nthey can only raise money by these means, in order to provide for the\r\ngeneral welfare. No man who reads it can say it is general as the\r\nhonorable gentleman represents it. You must violate every rule of\r\nconstruction and common sense, if you sever it from the power of\r\nraising money and annex it to any thing else, in order to make it that\r\nformidable power which it is represented to be.\r\n\r\nMr. George Mason. Mr. Chairman, with respect to commerce and\r\nnavigation, he has given it as his opinion, that their regulation, as\r\nit now stands, was a _sine qua non_ of the Union, and that without it,\r\nthe States in convention would never concur. I differ from him. It\r\nnever was, nor in my opinion ever will be, a _sine qua non_ of the\r\nUnion. I will give you, to the best of my recollection, the history of\r\nthat affair. This business was discussed at Philadelphia for four\r\nmonths, during which time the subject of commerce and navigation was\r\noften under consideration; and I assert, that eight States out of\r\ntwelve, for more than three months, voted for requiring two-thirds of\r\nthe members present in each house to pass commercial and navigation\r\nlaws. True it is, that afterwards it was carried by a majority, as it\r\nstands. If I am right, there was a great majority for requiring\r\ntwo-thirds of the States in this business, till a compromise took\r\nplace between the Northern and Southern States; the Northern States\r\nagreeing to the temporary importation of slaves, and the Southern\r\nStates conceding, in return, that navigation and commercial laws\r\nshould be on the footing on which they now stand. If I am mistaken,\r\nlet me be put right. These are my reasons for saying that this was\r\nnot a _sine qua non_ of their concurrence. The Newfoundland fisheries\r\nwill require that kind of security which we are now in want of. The\r\nEastern States therefore agreed at length, that treaties should\r\nrequire the consent of two-thirds of the members present in the\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison said--\r\n\r\nI was struck with surprise when I heard him express himself alarmed\r\nwith respect to the emancipation of slaves. Let me ask, if they should\r\neven attempt it, if it will not be an usurpation of power? There is no\r\npower to warrant it, in that paper. If there be, I know it not. But\r\nwhy should it be done? Says the honorable gentleman, for the general\r\nwelfare--it will infuse strength into our system. Can any member of\r\nthis committee suppose, that it will increase our strength? Can any\r\none believe, that the American councils will come into a measure which\r\nwill strip them of their property, discourage and alienate the\r\naffections of five-thirteenths of the Union? Why was nothing of this\r\nsort aimed at before? I believe such an idea never entered into an\r\nAmerican breast, nor do I believe it ever will, unless it will enter\r\ninto the heads of those gentlemen who substitute unsupported\r\nsuspicious for reasons.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry. He asked me where was the power of emancipating slaves? I\r\nsay it will be implied, unless implication be prohibited. He admits\r\nthat the power of granting passports will be in the new congress\r\nwithout the insertion of this restriction--yet he can show me nothing\r\nlike such a power granted in that constitution. Notwithstanding he\r\nadmits their right to this power by implication, he says that I am\r\nunfair and uncandid in my deduction, that they can emancipate our\r\nslaves, though the word emancipation is not mentioned in it. They can\r\nexercise power by implication in one instance, as well as in another.\r\nThus, by the gentleman's own argument, they can exercise the power\r\nthough it not be delegated.\r\n\r\nMr. Z. Johnson. They tell us that they see a progressive danger of\r\nbringing about emancipation. The principle has begun since the\r\nrevolution. Let us do what we will, it will come round. Slavery has\r\nbeen the foundation of that impiety and dissipation, which have been\r\nso much disseminated among our countrymen. If it were totally\r\nabolished, it would do much good.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe first three clauses of the second section read.\r\n\r\nMr. Goudy. Mr. Chairman, this clause of taxation will give an\r\nadvantage to some States over others. It will be oppressive to the\r\nSouthern States. Taxes are equal to our representation. To augment\r\nour taxes and increase our burthens, our negroes are to be\r\nrepresented. If a State has fifty thousand negroes, she is to send one\r\nrepresentative for them. I wish not to be represented with negroes,\r\nespecially if it increases my burthens.\r\n\r\nMr. Davie. Mr. Chairman, I will endeavor to obviate what the\r\ngentleman last up has said. I wonder to see gentlemen so precipitate\r\nand hasty on the subject of such awful importance. It ought to be\r\nconsidered, that _some_ of _us_ are slow of apprehension, not having\r\nthose quick conceptions, and luminous understandings, of which other\r\ngentlemen may be possessed. The gentleman \"does not wish to be\r\nrepresented with negroes.\" This, sir, is an unhappy species of\r\npopulation, but we cannot at present alter their situation. The\r\nEastern States had great jealousies on this subject. They insisted\r\nthat their cows and horses were equally entitled to representation;\r\nthat the one was property as well as the other. It became our duty on\r\nthe other hand, to acquire as much weight as possible in the\r\nlegislation of the Union; and as the Northern States were more\r\npopulous in whites, this only could be done by insisting that a\r\ncertain proportion of our slaves should make a part of the computed\r\npopulation. It was attempted to form a rule of representation from a\r\ncompound ratio of wealth and population; but, on consideration, it was\r\nfound impracticable to determine the comparative value of lands, and\r\nother property, in so extensive a territory, with any degree of\r\naccuracy; and population alone was adopted as the only practicable\r\nrule or criterion of representation. It was urged by the deputies of\r\nthe Eastern States, that a representation of two-fifths would be of\r\nlittle utility, and that their entire representation would be unequal\r\nand burthensome. That in a time of war, slaves rendered a country more\r\nvulnerable, while its defence devolved upon its _free_ inhabitants. On\r\nthe other hand, we insisted, that in time of peace they contributed by\r\ntheir labor to the general wealth as well as other members of the\r\ncommunity. That as rational beings they had a right of representation,\r\nand in some instances might be highly useful in war. On these\r\nprinciples, the Eastern States gave the matter up, and consented to\r\nthe regulation as it has been read. I hope these reasons will appear\r\nsatisfactory. It is the same rule or principle which was proposed some\r\nyears ago by Congress, and assented to by twelve of the States. It may\r\nwound the delicacy of the gentleman from Guilford, [Mr. Goudy,] but I\r\nhope he will endeavor to accommodate his feelings to the interests and\r\ncircumstances of his country.\r\n\r\nMr. James Galloway said, that he did not object to the representation\r\nof negroes, so much as he did to the fewness of the number of\r\nrepresentatives. He was surprised how we came to have but five,\r\nincluding those intended to represent negroes. That in his humble\r\nopinion North Carolina was entitled to that number independent of the\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\nFirst clause of the 9th section read.\r\n\r\nMr. J. M'Dowall wished to hear the reasons of this restriction.\r\n\r\nMr. Spaight answered that there was a contest between the Northern and\r\nSouthern States--that the Southern States, whose principal support\r\ndepended on the labor of slaves, would not consent to the desire of\r\nthe Northern States to exclude the importation of slaves absolutely.\r\nThat South Carolina and Georgia insisted on this clause, as they were\r\nnow in want of hands to cultivate their lands: That in the course of\r\ntwenty years they would be fully supplied: That the trade would be\r\nabolished then, and that in the mean time some tax or duty might be\r\nlaid on.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Dowall replied, that the explanation was just such as he\r\nexpected, and by no means satisfactory to him and that he looked upon\r\nit as a very objectionable part of the system.\r\n\r\nMr. Iredell. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express sentiments similar to\r\nthose of the gentleman from Craven. For my part, were it practicable\r\nto put an end to the importation of slaves immediately, it would give\r\nme the greatest pleasure, for it certainly is a trade utterly\r\ninconsistent with the rights of humanity, and under which great\r\ncruelties have been exercised. When the entire abolition of slavery\r\ntakes place, it will be an event which must be pleasing to every\r\ngenerous mind, and every friend of human nature; but we often wish for\r\nthings which are not attainable. It was the wish of a great majority\r\nof the Convention to put an end to the trade immediately, but the\r\nStates of South Carolina and Georgia would not agree to it. Consider\r\nthen what would be the difference between our present situation in\r\nthis respect, if we do not agree to the Constitution, and what it will\r\nbe if we do agree to it. If we do not agree to it, do we remedy the\r\nevil? No, sir, we do not; for if the constitution be not adopted, it\r\nwill be in the power of every State to continue it forever. They may\r\nor may not abolish it at their discretion. But if we adopt the\r\nconstitution, the trade must cease after twenty years, if congress\r\ndeclare so, whether particular States please so or not: surely, then,\r\nwe gain by it. This was the utmost that could be obtained. I heartily\r\nwish more could have been done. But as it is, this government is nobly\r\ndistinguished above others by that very provision. Where is there\r\nanother country in which such a restriction prevails? We, therefore,\r\nsir, set an example of humanity by providing for the abolition of this\r\ninhuman traffic, though at a distant period. I hope, therefore, that\r\nthis part of the constitution will not be condemned because it has not\r\nstipulated for what it was impracticable to obtain.\r\n\r\nMr. Spaight further explained the clause. That the limitation of this\r\ntrade to the term of twenty years, was a compromise between the\r\nEastern States and the Southern States. South Carolina and Georgia\r\nwished to extend the term. The Eastern States insisted on the entire\r\nabolition of the trade. That the State of North Carolina had not\r\nthought proper to pass any law prohibiting the importation of slaves,\r\nand therefore its delegation in the convention did not think\r\nthemselves authorized to contend for an immediate prohibition of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Iredell added to what he had said before, that the States of\r\nGeorgia and South Carolina had lost a great many slaves during the\r\nwar, and that they wished to supply the loss.\r\n\r\nMr. Galloway. Mr. Chairman, the explanation given to this clause does\r\nnot satisfy my mind. I wish to see this abominable trade put an end to.\r\nBut in case it be thought proper to continue this abominable traffic\r\nfor twenty years, yet I do not wish to see the tax on the importation\r\nextended to all persons whatsoever. Our situation is different from\r\nthe people to the North. We want citizens; they do not. Instead of\r\nlaying a tax, we ought to give a bounty, to encourage foreigners to\r\ncome among us. With respect to the abolition of slavery, it requires\r\nthe utmost consideration. The property of the Southern States consists\r\nprincipally of slaves. If they mean to do away slavery altogether,\r\nthis property will be destroyed. I apprehend it means to bring forward\r\nmanumission. If we must manumit our slaves, what country shall we send\r\nthem to? It is impossible for us to be happy if, after manumission,\r\nthey are to stay among us.\r\n\r\nMr. Iredell. Mr. Chairman, the worthy gentleman, I believe, has\r\nmisunderstood this clause, which runs in the following words: \"The\r\nmigration or importation of such persons as any of the States now\r\nexisting, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the\r\nCongress prior to the year 1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed on\r\n_such importation_, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\"\r\n\r\nNow, sir, observe that the Eastern States, who long ago have abolished\r\nslavery, did not approve of the expression _slaves_; they therefore\r\nused another that answered the same purpose. The committee will\r\nobserve the distinction between the two words migration and\r\nimportation. The first part of the clause will extend to persons who\r\ncome into the country as free people, or are brought as slaves, but\r\nthe last part extends to slaves only. The word _migration_ refers to\r\nfree persons; but the word _importation_ refers to slaves, because\r\nfree people cannot be said to be imported. The tax, therefore, is only\r\nto be laid on slaves who are imported, and not on free persons who\r\nmigrate. I further beg leave to say, that this gentleman is mistaken\r\nin another thing. He seems to say that this extends to the abolition\r\nof slavery. Is there anything in this constitution which says that\r\nCongress shall have it in their power to abolish the slavery of those\r\nslaves who are now in the country? Is it not the plain meaning of it,\r\nthat after twenty years they may prevent the future importation of\r\nslaves? It does not extend to those now in the country. There is\r\nanother circumstance to be observed. There is no authority vested in\r\ncongress to restrain the States in the interval of twenty years, from\r\ndoing what they please. If they wish to inhibit such importation, they\r\nmay do so. Our next assembly may put an entire end to the importation\r\nof slaves.\r\n\r\nArticle fourth. The first section and two first clauses of the second\r\nsection read without observation.\r\n\r\nThe last clause read--\r\n\r\nMr. Iredell begged leave to explain the reason of this clause. In some\r\nof the Northern States, they have emancipated all their slaves. If any\r\nof our slaves, said he, go there and remain there a certain time, they\r\ncould, by the present laws, be entitled to their freedom, so that\r\ntheir masters could not get them again. This would be extremely\r\nprejudicial to the inhabitants of the Southern States, and to prevent\r\nit, this clause is inserted in the constitution. Though the word slave\r\nbe not mentioned, this is the meaning of it. The Northern delegates,\r\nowing to their particular scruples on the subject of slavery, did not\r\nchoose the word _slave_ to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the fourth article read without any observation.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt is however to be observed, (said Mr. Iredell,) that the first and\r\nfourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article, are\r\nprotected from any alteration till the year 1808; and in order that no\r\nconsolidation should take place, it is provided, that no State shall,\r\nby any amendment or alteration, be ever deprived of an equal suffrage\r\nin the Senate without its own consent. The two first prohibitions are\r\nwith respect to the census, according to which direct taxes are\r\nimposed, and with respect to the importation of slaves. As to the\r\nfirst, it must be observed, that there is a material difference\r\nbetween the Northern and Southern States. The Northern States have\r\nbeen much longer settled, and are much fuller of people than the\r\nSouthern, but have not land in equal proportion, nor scarcely any\r\nslaves. The subject of this article was regulated with great\r\ndifficulty, and by a spirit of concession which it would not be\r\nprudent to disturb for a good many years. In twenty years there will\r\nprobably be a great alteration, and then the subject may be considered\r\nwith less difficulty and greater coolness. In the mean time, the\r\ncompromise was upon the best footing that could be obtained. A\r\ncompromise likewise took place with regard to the importation of\r\nslaves. It is probable that all the members reprobated this inhuman\r\ntraffic, but those of South Carolina and Georgia would not consent to\r\nan immediate prohibition of it; one reason of which was, that during\r\nthe last war they lost a vast number of negroes, which loss they wish\r\nto supply. In the mean time, it is left to the States to admit or\r\nprohibit the importation, and Congress may impose a limited duty upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nHon. Rawlins Lowndes. In the first place, what cause was there for\r\njealousy of our importing negroes?  Why confine us to twenty years, or\r\nrather why limit us at all?  For his part he thought this trade could\r\nbe justified on the principles of religion, humanity, and justice; for\r\ncertainly to translate a set of human beings from a bad country to a\r\nbetter, was fulfilling every part of these principles. But they don't\r\nlike our slaves, because they have none themselves; and therefore want\r\nto exclude us from this great advantage; why should the Southern\r\nStates allow of this, without the consent of nine States?\r\n\r\nJudge Pendleton observed, that only three States, Georgia, South\r\nCarolina, and North Carolina, allowed the importation of negroes.\r\nVirginia had a clause in her constitution for this purpose, and\r\nMaryland, he believed, even before the war, prohibited them.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowndes continued--that we had a law prohibiting the importation\r\nof negroes for three years, a law he greatly approved of; but there\r\nwas no reason offered, why the Southern States might not find it\r\nnecessary to alter their conduct, and open their ports. Without\r\nnegroes this State would degenerate into one of the most contemptible\r\nin the Union: and cited an expression that fell from Gen. Pinckney on\r\na former debate, that whilst there remained one acre of swamp land in\r\nSouth Carolina he should raise his voice against restricting the\r\nimportation of negroes. Even in granting the importation for twenty\r\nyears, care had been taken to make us pay for this indulgence, each\r\nnegro being liable, on importation, to pay a duty not exceeding ten\r\ndollars, and, in addition this, were liable to a capitation tax.\r\nNegroes were our wealth, our only natural resource; yet behold how our\r\nkind friends in the North were determined soon to tie up our hands,\r\nand drain us of what we had. The Eastern States drew their means of\r\nsubsistence, in a great treasure, from their shipping; and on that\r\nhead, they had been particularly careful not to allow of any burdens:\r\nthey were not to pay tonnage, or duties; no, not even the form of\r\nclearing out: all ports were free and open to them! Why, then, call\r\nthis a reciprocal bargain, which took all from one party, to bestow it\r\non the other?\r\n\r\nMajor Butler observed that they were to pay a five per cent impost.\r\nThis, Mr. Lowndes proved, must fall upon the consumer. They are to be\r\nthe carriers: and we, being the consumers, therefore all expenses\r\nwould fall upon us.\r\n\r\nHon. E. Rutledge. The gentleman had complained of the inequality of\r\nthe taxes between the Northern and Southern States--that ten dollars a\r\nhead was imposed on the importation of negroes, and that those negroes\r\nwere afterwards taxed. To this it was answered, that the ten dollars\r\nper head was an equivalent to the five per cent on imported articles;\r\nand as to their being afterwards taxed, the advantage is on our side;\r\nor, at least, not against us.\r\n\r\nIn the Northern State, the labor is performed by white people; in the\r\nSouthern by black. All the free people (and there are few others) in\r\nthe Northern States, are to be taxed by the new constitution whereas,\r\nonly the free people, and two-fifths of the slaves in the Southern\r\nStates are to be rated in the apportioning of taxes.\r\n\r\nBut the principal objection is, that no duties are laid on\r\nshipping--that in fact the carrying trade was to be vested in a great\r\nmeasure in the Americans; that the ship-building business was\r\nprincipally carried on in the Northern States. When this subject is\r\nduly considered, the Southern States, should be the last to object to\r\nit. Mr. Rutledge then went into a consideration of the subject; after\r\nwhich the House adjourned.\r\n\r\nGen. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. We were at a loss for some time for\r\na rule to ascertain the proportionate wealth of the States, at last we\r\nthought that the productive labor of the inhabitants was the best rule\r\nfor ascertaining their wealth; in conformity to this rule, joined to a\r\nspirit of concession, we determined that representatives should be\r\napportioned among the several States, by adding to the whole number of\r\nfree persons three-fifths of the slaves. We thus obtained a\r\nrepresentation for our property, and I confess I did not expect that\r\nwe had conceded too much to the Eastern States, when they allowed us a\r\nrepresentation for a species of property which they have not among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe honorable gentleman alleges, that the Southern States are weak, I\r\nsincerely agree with him--we are so weak that by ourselves we could\r\nnot form an union strong enough for the purpose of effectually\r\nprotecting each other. Without union with the other States, South\r\nCarolina must soon fall. Is there any one among us so much a Quixotte\r\nas to suppose that this State could long maintain her independence if\r\nshe stood alone, or was only connected with the Southern States? I\r\nscarcely believe there is. Let an invading power send a naval force\r\ninto the Chesapeake to keep Virginia in alarm, and attack South\r\nCarolina with such a naval and military force as Sir Henry Clinton\r\nbrought here in 1780, and though they might not soon conquer us, they\r\nwould certainly do us an infinite deal of mischief; and if they\r\nconsiderably increased their numbers, we should probably fall. As,\r\nfrom the nature of our climate, and the fewness of our inhabitants, we\r\nare undoubtedly weak, should we not endeavor to form a close union\r\nwith the Eastern States, who are strong?\r\n\r\nFor who have been the greatest sufferers in the Union, by our\r\nobtaining, our independence? I answer, the Eastern States; they have\r\nlost every thing but their country, and their freedom. It is notorious\r\nthat some ports to the Eastward, which used to fit out one hundred and\r\nfifty sail of vessels, do not now fit out thirty; that their trade of\r\nship-building, which used to be very considerable, is now annihilated;\r\nthat their fisheries are trifling, and their mariners in want of\r\nbread; surely we are called upon by every tie of justice, friendships,\r\nand humanity, to relieve their distresses; and as by their exertions\r\nthey have assisted us in establishing our freedom, we should let them,\r\nin some measure, partake of our prosperity. The General then said he\r\nwould make a few observations on the objections which the gentleman\r\nhad thrown out on the restrictions that might be laid on the African\r\ntrade after the year 1808. On this point your delegates had to contend\r\nwith the religious and political prejudices of the Eastern and Middle\r\nStates, and with the interested and inconsistent opinion of Virginia,\r\nwho was warmly opposed to our importing more slaves. I am of the same\r\nopinion now as I was two years ago, when I used the expressions that\r\nthe gentleman has quoted, that while there remained one acre of swamp\r\nland uncleared of South Carolina, I would raise my voice against\r\nrestricting the importation of negroes. I am as thoroughly convinced\r\nas that gentleman is, that the nature of our climate, and the flat\r\nswampy situation of our country, obliges us to cultivate our land with\r\nnegroes, and that without them South Carolina would soon be a desert\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nYou have so frequently heard my sentiments on this subject that I need\r\nnot now repeat them. It was alleged, by some of the members who\r\nopposed an unlimited importation, that slaves increased the weakness\r\nof any State who admitted them; that they were a dangerous species of\r\nproperty, which an invading enemy could easily turn against ourselves\r\nand the neighboring States, and that as we were allowed a\r\nrepresentation for them in the House of Representatives, our influence\r\nin government would be increased in proportion as we were less able to\r\ndefend ourselves. \"Show some period,\" said the members from the\r\nEastern States, \"when it may be in our power to put a stop, if we\r\nplease, to the importation of this weakness, and we will endeavor, for\r\nyour convenience, to restrain the religious and political prejudices\r\nof our people on this subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe Middle States and Virginia made us no such proposition; they were\r\nfor an immediate and total prohibition. We endeavored to obviate the\r\nobjections that were made, in the best manner we could, and assigned\r\nreasons for our insisting on the importation, which there is no\r\noccasion to repeat, as they must occur to every gentleman in the\r\nHouse: a committee of the States was appointed in order to accommodate\r\nthis matter, and after a great deal of difficulty, it was settled on\r\nthe footing recited in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBy this settlement we have secured an unlimited importation of negroes\r\nfor twenty years; nor is it declared that the importation shall be\r\nthen stopped; it may be continued--we have a security that the general\r\ngovernment can never emancipate them, for no such authority is\r\ngranted, and it is admitted on all hands, that the general government\r\nhas no powers but what are expressly granted by the constitution; and\r\nthat all rights not expressed were reserved by the several States. We\r\nhave obtained a right to recover our slaves, in whatever part of\r\nAmerica they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before. In\r\nshort, considering all circumstances, we have made the best terms, for\r\nthe security of this species of property, it was in our power to make.\r\nWe would have made better if we could, but on the whole I do not think\r\nthem bad.\r\n\r\nHon. Robert Barnwell. Mr. Barnwell continued to say, I now come to the\r\nlast point for consideration, I mean the clause relative to the\r\nnegroes; and here I am particularly pleased with the Constitution; it\r\nhas not left this matter of so much importance to us open to immediate\r\ninvestigation; no, it has declared that the United States shall not,\r\nat any rate, consider this matter for twenty-one years, and yet\r\ngentlemen are displeased with it.\r\n\r\nCongress has guaranteed this right for that space of time, and at its\r\nexpiration may continue it as long as they please. This question then\r\narises, what will their interest lead them to do? The Eastern States,\r\nas the honorable gentleman says, will become the carriers of America,\r\nit will, therefore certainly be their interest to encourage\r\nexportation to as great an extent as possible; and if the quantum of\r\nour products will be diminished by the prohibition of negroes, I\r\nappeal to the belief of every man, whether he thinks those very\r\ncarriers will themselves dam up the resources from whence their profit\r\nis derived? To think so is so contradictory to the general conduct of\r\nmankind, that I am of opinion, that without we ourselves put a stop to\r\nthem, the traffic for negroes will continue forever.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST, No. 42.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES MADISON\r\n\r\nIt were doubtless to be wished, that the power of prohibiting the\r\nimportation of slaves, had not been postponed until the year 1808, or\r\nrather that it had been suffered to have immediate operation. But it\r\nis not difficult to account either for this restriction on the general\r\ngovernment, or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of\r\nhumanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate for ever within\r\nthese States, a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the\r\nbarbarism of modern policy; that within that period, it will receive a\r\nconsiderable discouragement from the Federal government, and may be\r\ntotally abolished, by a concurrence of the few States which continue\r\nthe unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given\r\nby so great a majority of the Union. Happy would it be for the\r\nunfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before them, of being\r\nredeemed from the oppressions of their European brethern! Attempts\r\nhave been made to pervert this clause into an objection against the\r\nConstitution, by representing it on one side, as a criminal toleration\r\nof an illicit practice; and on another, as calculated to prevent\r\nvoluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America. I mention\r\nthese misconstructions, not with a view to give them an answer, for\r\nthey deserve none; but as specimens of the manner and spirit, in which\r\nsome have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST, No. 54.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nAll this is admitted, it will perhaps be said: but does it follow from\r\nan admission of numbers for the measure of representation, or of\r\nslaves combined with free citizens as a ratio of taxation, that slaves\r\nought to be included in the numerical rule of representation?\r\n\r\nSlaves are considered as property, not as persons. They ought\r\ntherefore, to be comprehended in estimates of taxation, which are\r\nfounded on property, and to be excluded from representation, which is\r\nregulated by a census of persons. This is the objection as I\r\nunderstand it, stated in its full force. I shall be equally candid in\r\nstating the reasoning which may be offered on the opposite side. We\r\nsubscribe to the doctrine, might one of our Southern brethern observe,\r\nthat representation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation\r\nmore immediately to property; and we join in the application of this\r\ndistinction to the case of our slaves.\r\n\r\nBut we must deny the fact, that slaves are considered merely as\r\nproperty, and in no respect whatever as persons. The true state of the\r\ncase is, that they partake of both these qualities, being considered\r\nby our laws, in some respects as persons, and in other respects as\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIn being compelled to labor, not for himself, but for a master; in\r\nbeing vendible by one master to another master; and in being subject\r\nat all times to be restrained in his liberty: and chastised in his\r\nbody by the capricious will of another; the slave may appear to be\r\ndegraded from the human rank, and classed with those irrational\r\nanimals which fall under the legal denomination of property. In being\r\nprotected, on the other hand, in his life, and in his limbs, against\r\nthe violence of all others, even the master of his labor and his\r\nliberty; and in being punishable himself for all violence committed\r\nagainst others; the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as\r\na member of the society, not as a part of the irrational creation; as\r\na moral person, not as a mere article of property. The Federal\r\nconstitution, therefore, decides with great propriety on the case of\r\nour slaves, when it views them in the mixed character of persons and\r\nproperty. This is in fact their true character. It is the character\r\nbestowed on them by the laws under which they live, and it will not be\r\ndenied, that these are the proper criterion; because it is only under\r\nthe pretext, that the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects\r\nof property, that a place is disputed them in the computation of\r\nnumbers; and it is admitted, that if the laws were to restore the\r\nrights which have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be\r\nrefused an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThis question may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all\r\nsides, that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation, as they\r\nare the only proper scale of representation. Would the convention have\r\nbeen impartial or consistent, if they had rejected the slaves from the\r\nlist of inhabitants, when the shares of representation were to be\r\ncalculated; and inserted them on the lists when the tariff of\r\ncontributions was to be adjusted?\r\n\r\nCould it be reasonably expected, that the Southern States would concur\r\nin a system, which considered their slaves in some degree as men, when\r\nburdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider them in the same\r\nlight, when advantages were to be conferred?\r\n\r\nMight not some surprise also be expressed, that those who reproach the\r\nSouthern States with the, barbarous policy of considering as property\r\na part of their human brethern, should themselves contend, that the\r\ngovernment to which all the States are to be parties, ought to\r\nconsider this unfortunate race more completely in the unnatural light\r\nof property, than the very laws of which they complain?\r\n\r\nIt may be replied, perhaps, that slaves are not included in the\r\nestimate of representatives in any of the States possessing them. They\r\nneither vote themselves, nor increase the votes of their masters. Upon\r\nwhat principle, then, ought they to be taken into the Federal estimate\r\nof representation? In rejecting them altogether, the constitution\r\nwould, in this respect, have followed the very laws which have been\r\nappealed to as the proper guide.\r\n\r\nThis objection is repelled by a single observation. It is a\r\nfundamental principle of the proposed constitution, that as the\r\naggregate number of representatives allotted to the several States is\r\nto be determined by a Federal rule, founded on the aggregate number of\r\ninhabitants; so, the right of choosing this allotted number in each\r\nState, is to be exercised by such part of the inhabitants, as the\r\nState itself may designate. The qualifications of which the right of\r\nsuffrage depends, are not perhaps the same in any two States. In some\r\nof the States the difference is very material. In every State, a\r\ncertain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by the\r\nconstitution of the State, who will be included in the census by which\r\nthe Federal constitution apportions the representatives. In this point\r\nof view, the Southern States might retort the complaint, by insisting,\r\nthat the principle laid down by the convention required that no regard\r\nshould be had to the policy of particular States towards their own\r\ninhabitants; and consequently, that the slaves, as inhabitants, should\r\nhave been admitted into the census according to their full number, in\r\nlike manner with other inhabitants, who, by the policy of other\r\nStates, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A rigorous\r\nadherence, however, to this principle is waived by those who would be\r\ngainers by it. All that they ask, is that equal moderation be shown on\r\nthe other side. Let the case of the slaves be considered, as it is in\r\ntruth, a peculiar one. Let the compromising expedient of the\r\nconstitution be annually adopted, which regards them as inhabitants,\r\nbut as debased by servitude below the equal level of free inhabitants,\r\nwhich regards the _slave_ as divested of two-fifths of the _man_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEBATES IN FIRST CONGRESS,\r\n\r\nMAY 13, 1789.\r\n\r\nMr. Parker (of Va.) moved to insert a clause in the bill, imposing a\r\nduty on the importation of slaves of ten dollars each person. He was\r\nsorry that the constitution prevented Congress from prohibiting the\r\nimportation altogether; he thought it a defect in that instrument that\r\nit allowed of such actions, it was contrary to the revolution\r\nprinciples, and ought not to be permitted; but as he could not do all\r\nthe good he desired, he was willing to do what lay in his power. He\r\nhoped such a duty as he moved for would prevent, in some degree, this\r\nirrational and inhuman traffic; if so, he should feel happy from the\r\nsuccess of his motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith (of South Carolina,) hoped that such an important and\r\nserious proposition as this would not be hastily adopted; it was a\r\nvery late moment for the introduction of new subjects. He expected the\r\ncommittee had got through the business, and would rise without\r\ndiscussing any thing further; at least, if gentlemen were determined\r\non considering the present motion, he hoped they would delay for a few\r\ndays, in order to give time for an examination of the subject. It was\r\ncertainly a matter big with the most serious consequences to the State\r\nhe represented; he did not think any one thing that had been discussed\r\nwas so important to them, and the welfare of the Union, as the\r\nquestion now brought forward, but he was not prepared to enter on any\r\nargument, and therefore requested the motion might either be withdrawn\r\nor laid on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman (of Ct.) approved of the object of the motion, but he did\r\nnot think this bill was proper to embrace the subject. He could not\r\nreconcile himself to the insertion of human beings as an article of\r\nduty, among goods, wares and merchandise. He hoped it would be\r\nwithdrawn for the present, and taken up hereafter as an independent\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson, (of Geo.) observing the quarter from which this motion\r\ncame, said it did not surprise him, though it might have that effect\r\non others. He recollected that Virginia was an old settled State, and\r\nhad her complement of slaves, so she was careless of recruiting her\r\nnumbers by this means; the natural increase of her imported blacks\r\nwere sufficient for their purpose; but he thought gentlemen ought to\r\nlet their neighbors get supplied before they imposed such a burthen\r\nupon the importation. He knew this business was viewed in an odious\r\nlight to the Eastward, because the people were capable of doing their\r\nown work, and had no occasion for slaves; but gentlemen will have some\r\nfeeling for others; they will not try to throw all the weight upon\r\nothers, who have assisted in lightening their burdens; they do not\r\nwish to charge us for every comfort and enjoyment of life, and at the\r\nsame time take away the means of procuring them; they do not wish to\r\nbreak us down at once.\r\n\r\nHe was convinced, from the inaptitude of the motion, and the want of\r\ntime to consider it, that the candor of the gentleman would induce him\r\nto withdraw it for the present; and if ever it came forward again, he\r\nhoped it would comprehend the white slaves as well as black, who were\r\nimported from all the goals of Europe; wretches, convicted of the most\r\nflagrant crimes, were brought in and sold without any duty whatever.\r\nHe thought that they ought to be taxed equal to the Africans, and had\r\nno doubt but the constitutionality and propriety of such a measure was\r\nequally apparent as the one proposed.\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker (of S.C.) thought it unfair to bring in such an important\r\nsubject at the time when debate was almost precluded. The committee\r\nhad gone through the impost bill, and the whole Union were impatiently\r\nexpecting the result of their deliberations, the public must be\r\ndisappointed and much revenue lost, or this question cannot undergo\r\nthat full discussion which it deserves.\r\n\r\nWe have no right, said he, to consider whether the importation of\r\nslaves is proper or not; the Constitution gives us no power on that\r\npoint, it is left to the States to judge of that matter as they see\r\nfit. But if it was a business the gentleman was determined to\r\ndiscourage, he ought to have brought his motion forward sooner, and\r\neven then not have introduced it without previous notice. He hoped the\r\ncommittee would reject the motion, if it was not withdrawn; he was not\r\nspeaking so much for the State he represented, as for Georgia, because\r\nthe State of South Carolina had a prohibitory law, which could be\r\nrenewed when its limitation expired.\r\n\r\nMr. Parker (of Va.,) had ventured to introduce the subject after full\r\ndeliberation, and did not like to withdraw it. Although the gentleman\r\nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Sherman) had said, that they ought not to be\r\nenumerated with goods, wares, and merchandise, he believed they were\r\nlooked upon by the African traders in this light, he knew it was\r\ndegrading the human species to annex that character to them; but he\r\nwould rather do this than continue the actual evil of importing slaves\r\na moment longer. He hoped Congress would do all that lay in their\r\npower to restore to human nature its inherent privileges, and if\r\npossible wipe off the stigma which America laboured under. The\r\ninconsistency in our principles, with which we are justly charged,\r\nshould be done away; that we may shew by our actions the pure\r\nbeneficence of the doctrine we held out to the world in our\r\ndeclaration of independence.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman (of Ct.,) thought the principles of the motion and the\r\nprinciples of the bill were inconsistent; the principle of the bill\r\nwas to raise revenue, the principle of the motion to correct a moral\r\nevil. Now, considering it as an object of revenue, it would be unjust,\r\nbecause two or three States would bear the whole burthen, while he\r\nbelieved they bore their full proportion of all the rest. He was\r\nagainst receiving the motion into this bill, though he had no\r\nobjection to taking it up by itself, on the principles of humanity and\r\npolicy; and therefore would vote against it if it was not withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMr. Ames (of Mass.,) joined the gentleman last up. No one could\r\nsuppose him favorable to slavery, he detested it from his soul, but he\r\nhad some doubts whether imposing a duty on the importation, would not\r\nhave the appearance of countenancing the practice; it was certainly a\r\nsubject of some delicacy, and no one appeared to be prepared for the\r\ndiscussion, he therefore hoped the motion would be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMr. Livermore. Was not against the principle of the motion, but in the\r\npresent case he conceived it improper. If negroes were goods, wares,\r\nor merchandise, they came within the title of the bill; if they were\r\nnot, the bill would be inconsistent: but if they are goods, wares or\r\nmerchandise, the 5 per cent ad valorum, will embrace the importation;\r\nand the duty of 5 per cent is nearly equal to 10 dollars per head, so\r\nthere is no occasion to add it even on the score of revenue.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson (of Ga.,) said it was the fashion of the day, to favor the\r\nliberty of slaves; he would not go into a discussion of the subject,\r\nbut he believed it was capable of demonstration that they were better\r\noff in their present situation, than they would be if they were\r\nmanumitted; what are they to do if they are discharged? Work for a\r\nliving? Experience has shewn us they will not. Examine what is become\r\nof those in Maryland, many of them have been set free in that State;\r\ndid they turn themselves to industry and useful pursuits? No, they\r\nturn out common pickpockets, petty larceny villains; and is this\r\nmercy, forsooth, to turn them into a way in which they must lose their\r\nlives,--for where they are thrown upon the world, void of property and\r\nconnections, they cannot get their living but by pilfering. What is to\r\nbe done for compensation? Will Virginia set all her negroes free? Will\r\nthey give up the money they cost them, and to whom? When this practice\r\ncomes to be tried there, the sound of liberty will lose those charms\r\nwhich make it grateful to the ravished ear.\r\n\r\nBut our slaves are not in a worse situation than they were on the\r\ncoast of Africa; it is not uncommon there for the parents to sell\r\ntheir children in peace; and in war the whole are taken and made\r\nslaves together. In these cases it is only a change of one slavery for\r\nanother; and are they not better here, where they have a master bound\r\nby the ties of interest and law to provide for their support and\r\ncomfort in old age, or infirmity, in which, if they were free, they\r\nwould sink under the pressure of woe for want of assistance.\r\n\r\nHe would say nothing of the partiality of such a tax, it was admitted\r\nby the avowed friends of the measure; Georgia in particular would be\r\noppressed. On this account it would be the most odious tax Congress\r\ncould impose.\r\n\r\nMr. Schureman (of N.J.) hoped the gentleman would withdraw his motion,\r\nbecause the present was not the time or place for introducing the\r\nbusiness; he thought it had better be brought forward in the House, as\r\na distinct proposition. If the gentleman persisted in having the\r\nquestion determined, he would move the previous question if he was\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, (of Va.) I cannot concur with gentlemen who think the\r\npresent an improper time or place to enter into a discussion of the\r\nproposed motion; if it is taken up in a separate view, we shall do the\r\nsame thing at a greater expense of time. But the gentlemen say that it\r\nis improper to connect the two objects, because they do not come\r\nwithin the title of the bill. But this objection may be obviated by\r\naccommodating the title to the contents; there may be some\r\ninconsistency in combining the ideas which gentlemen have expressed,\r\nthat is, considering the human race as a species of property; but the\r\nevil does not arise from adopting the clause now proposed, it is from\r\nthe importation to which it relates. Our object in enumerating persons\r\non paper with merchandise, is to prevent the practice of actually\r\ntreating them as such, by having them, in future, forming part of the\r\ncargoes of goods, wares, and merchandise to be imported into the\r\nUnited States. The motion is calculated to avoid the very evil\r\nintimated by the gentleman. It has been said that this tax will be\r\npartial and oppressive; but suppose a fair view is taken of this\r\nsubject, I think we may form a different conclusion. But if it be\r\npartial or oppressive, are there not many instances in which we have\r\nlaid taxes of this nature? Yet are they not thought to be justified by\r\nnational policy? If any article is warranted on this account, how much\r\nmore are we authorized to proceed on this occasion? The dictates of\r\nhumanity, the principles of the people, the national safety and\r\nhappiness, and prudent policy requires it of us; the constitution has\r\nparticularly called our attention to it--and of all the articles\r\ncontained in the bill before us, this is one of the last I should be\r\nwilling to make a concession upon so far as I was at liberty to go,\r\naccording to the terms of the constitution or principles of justice--I\r\nwould not have it understood that my zeal would carry me to disobey\r\nthe inviolable commands of either.\r\n\r\nI understood it had been intimated, that the motion was inconsistent\r\nor unconstitutional. I believe, sir, my worthy colleague has formed\r\nthe words with a particular reference to the constitution; any how, so\r\nfar as the duty is expressed, it perfectly accords with that\r\ninstrument; if there are any inconsistencies in it, they may be\r\nrectified; I believe the intention is well understood, but I am far\r\nfrom supposing the diction improper. If the description of the persons\r\ndoes not accord with the ideas of the gentleman from Georgia, (Mr.\r\nJackson,) and his idea is a proper one for the committee to adopt, I\r\nsee no difficulty in changing the phraseology.\r\n\r\nI conceive the constitution, in this particular, was formed in order\r\nthat the government, whilst it was restrained from laying a total\r\nprohibition, might be able to give some testimony of the sense of\r\nAmerica, with respect to the African trade. We have liberty to impose\r\na tax or duty upon the importation of such persons as any of the\r\nStates now existing shall think proper to admit; and this liberty was\r\ngranted, I presume, upon two considerations--the first was, that until\r\nthe time arrived when they might abolish the importation of slaves,\r\nthey might have an opportunity of evidencing their sentiments, on the\r\npolicy and humanity of such a trade; the other was that they might be\r\ntaxed in due proportion with other articles imported; for if the\r\npossessor will consider them as property, of course they are of value\r\nand ought to be paid for. If gentlemen are apprehensive of oppression\r\nfrom the weight of the tax, let them make an estimate of its\r\nproportion, and they will find that it very little exceeds five per\r\ncent, ad valorem, so that they will gain very little by having them\r\nthrown into that mass of articles, whilst by selecting them in the\r\nmanner proposed, we shall fulfil the prevailing expectation of our\r\nfellow citizens, and perform our duty in executing the purposes of the\r\nconstitution. It is to be hoped that by expressing a national\r\ndisapprobation of this trade, we may destroy it, and save ourselves\r\nfrom reproaches, and our posterity the imbecility ever attendant on a\r\ncountry filled with slaves.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to say any thing harsh, to the hearing of gentlemen who\r\nentertain different sentiments from me, or different sentiments from\r\nthose I represent; but if there is any one point in which it is\r\nclearly the policy of this nation, so far as we constitutionally can,\r\nto vary the practice obtaining under some of the State governments, it\r\nis this; but it is certain a majority of the States are opposed to\r\nthis practice, therefore, upon principle, we ought to discountenance\r\nit as far as is in our power.\r\n\r\nIf I was not afraid of being told that the representatives of the\r\nseveral States, are the best able to judge of what is proper and\r\nconducive to their particular prosperity, I should venture to say that\r\nit is as much the interest of Georgia and South Carolina, as of any in\r\nthe Union. Every addition they receive to their number of slaves,\r\ntends to weaken them and renders them less capable of self defence. In\r\ncase of hostilities with foreign nations, they will be the means of\r\ninviting attack instead of repelling invasion. It is a necessary duty\r\nof the general government to protect every part of the empire against\r\ndanger, as well internal as external; every thing therefore which\r\ntends to increase this danger, though it may be a local affair, yet if\r\nit involves national expense or safety, becomes of concern to every\r\npart of the Union, and is a proper subject for the consideration of\r\nthose charged with the general administration of the government. I\r\nhope, in making these observations, I shall not be understood to mean\r\nthat a proper attention ought not to be paid to the local opinions and\r\ncircumstances of any part of the United States, or that the particular\r\nrepresentatives are not best able to judge of the sense of their\r\nimmediate constituents.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the proposal measure by the agreement there is between\r\nit, and the existing State laws, it will show us that it is patronized\r\nby a very respectable part of the Union. I am informed that South\r\nCarolina has prohibited the importation of slaves for several years\r\nyet to come; we have the satisfaction then of reflecting that we do\r\nnothing more than their own laws do at this moment. This is not the\r\ncase with one State. I am sorry that her situation is such as to seem\r\nto require a population of this nature, but it is impossible in the\r\nnature of things, to consult the national good without doing what we\r\ndo not wish to do, to some particular part. Perhaps gentlemen contend\r\nagainst the introduction of the clause, on too slight grounds. If it\r\ndoes not conform with the title of the bill, alter the latter; if it\r\ndoes not conform to the precise terms of the constitution, amend it.\r\nBut if it will tend to delay the whole bill, that perhaps will be the\r\nbest reason for making it the object of a separate one. If this is the\r\nsense of the committee I shall submit.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerry (of Mass.) thought all duties ought to be laid as equal as\r\npossible. He had endeavored to enforce this principle yesterday, but\r\nwithout the success he wished for, he was bound by the principles of\r\njustice therefore to vote for the proposition; but if the committee\r\nwere desirous of considering the subject fully by itself, he had no\r\nobjection, but he thought when gentlemen laid down a principle, they\r\nought to support it generally.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke (of S.C.) said, gentlemen were contending for nothing; that\r\nthe value of a slave averaged about £80, and the duty on that sum at\r\nfive per cent, would be ten dollars, as congress could go no farther\r\nthan that sum, he conceived it made not difference whether they were\r\nenumerated or left in the common mass.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, (of Va.) If we contend for nothing, the gentlemen who are\r\nopposed to us do not contend for a great deal; but the question is,\r\nwhether the five percent ad valorem, on all articles imported, will\r\nhave any operation at all upon the introduction of slaves, unless we\r\nmake a particular enumeration on this account; the collector may\r\nmistake, for he would not presume to apply the term goods, wares, and\r\nmerchandise to any person whatsoever. But if that general definition\r\nof goods, wares, and merchandise are supposed to include African\r\nSlaves, why may we not particularly enumerate them, and lay the duty\r\npointed out by the Constitution, which, as gentlemen tell us, is no\r\nmore than five per cent upon their value; this will not increase the\r\nburden upon any, but it will be that manifestation of our sense,\r\nexpected by our constituents, and demanded by justice and humanity.\r\n\r\nMr. Bland (of Va.) had no doubt of the propriety or good policy of\r\nthis measure. He had made up his mind upon it, he wished slaves had\r\nnever been introduced into America; but if it was impossible at this\r\ntime to cure the evil, he was very willing to join in any measures\r\nthat would prevent its extending farther. He had some doubts whether\r\nthe prohibitory laws of the States were not in part repealed. Those\r\nwho had endeavored to discountenance this trade, by laying a duty on\r\nthe importation, were prevented by the Constitution from continuing\r\nsuch regulation, which declares, that no State shall lay any impost or\r\nduties on imports. If this was the case, and he suspected pretty\r\nstrongly that it was, the necessity of adopting the proposition of his\r\ncolleague was not apparent.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman (of Ct.) said, the Constitution does not consider these\r\npersons as a species of property; it speaks of them as persons, and\r\nsays, that a tax or duty may be imposed on the importation of them\r\ninto any State which shall permit the same, but they have no power to\r\nprohibit such importation for twenty years. But Congress have power to\r\ndeclare upon what terms persons coming into the United States shall be\r\nentitled to citizenship; the rule of naturalization must however be\r\nuniform. He was convinced there were others ought to be regulated in\r\nthis particular, the importation of whom was of an evil tendency, he\r\nmeant convicts particularly. He thought that some regulation\r\nrespecting them was also proper; but it being a different subject, it\r\nought to be taken up in a different manner.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison (of Va.) was led to believe, from the observation that had\r\nfell from the gentlemen, that it would be best to make this the\r\nsubject of a distinct bill: he therefore wished his colleague would\r\nwithdraw his motion, and move in the house for leave to bring in a\r\nbill on the same principles.\r\n\r\nMr. Parker (of Va.) consented to withdraw his motion, under a\r\nconviction that the house was fully satisfied of its propriety. He\r\nknew very well that these persons were neither goods, nor wares, but\r\nthey were treated as articles of merchandise. Although he wished to\r\nget rid of this part of his property, yet he should not consent to\r\ndeprive other people of theirs by any act of his without their\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nThe committee rose, reported progress, and the house adjourned.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 11th, 1790.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrance (of New York,) presented an address from the society of\r\nFriends, in the City of New York; in which they set forth their desire\r\nof co-operating with their Southern brethren.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartley (of Penn.) then moved to refer the address of the annual\r\nassembly of Friends, held at Philadelphia, to a committee; he thought\r\nit a mark of respect due so numerous and respectable a part of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nMr. White (of Va.) seconded the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith, (of S.C.) However respectable the petitioners may be, I\r\nhope gentlemen will consider that others equally respectable are\r\nopposed to the object which is aimed at, and are entitled to an\r\nopportunity of being heard before the question is determined. I\r\nflatter myself gentlemen will not press the point of commitment\r\nto-day, it being contrary to our usual mode of procedure.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzsimons, (of Penn.) If we were now about to determine the final\r\nquestion, the observation of the gentleman from South Carolina would\r\napply; but, sir, the present question does not touch upon the merits\r\nof the case; it is merely to refer the memorial to a committee, to\r\nconsider what is proper to be done; gentlemen, therefore, who do not\r\nmean to oppose the commitment to-morrow, may as well agree to it\r\nto-day, because it will tend to save the time of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson (of Geo.) wished to know why the second reading was to be\r\ncontended for to-day, when it was diverting the attention of the\r\nmembers from the great object that was before the committee of the\r\nwhole? Is it because the feelings of the Friends will be hurt, to have\r\ntheir affair conducted in the usual course of business? Gentlemen who\r\nadvocate the second reading to-day, should respect the feelings of the\r\nmembers who represent that part of the Union which is principally to\r\nbe affected by the measure. I believe, sir, that the latter class\r\nconsists of as useful and as good citizens as the petitioners, men\r\nequally friends to the revolution, and equally susceptible of the\r\nrefined sensations of humanity and benevolence. Why then should such\r\nparticular attention be paid to them, for bringing forward a business\r\nof questionable policy? If Congress are disposed to interfere in the\r\nimportation of slaves, they can take the subject up without advisers,\r\nbecause the Constitution expressly mentions all the power they can\r\nexercise on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman (of Conn.) suggested the idea of referring it to a\r\ncommittee, to consist of a member from each State, because several\r\nStates had already made some regulations on this subject. The sooner\r\nthe subject was taken up he thought it would be the better.\r\n\r\nMr. Parker, (of Va.) I hope, Mr. Speaker, the petition of these\r\nrespectable people, will be attended to with all the readiness the\r\nimportance of its object demands: and I cannot help expressing the\r\npleasure I feel in finding so considerable a part of the community\r\nattending to matters of such momentous concern to the future\r\nprosperity and happiness of the people of America. I think it my duty,\r\nas a citizen of the Union, to espouse their cause; and it is incumbent\r\nupon every member of this house to sift the subject well, and\r\nascertain what can be done to restrain a practice so nefarious. The\r\nConstitution has authorized as to levy a tax upon the importation of\r\nsuch persons as the States shall authorize to be admitted. I would\r\nwillingly go to that extent; and if any thing further can be devised\r\nto discountenance the trade, consistent with the terms of the\r\nConstitution, I shall cheerfully give it my assent and support.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, (of Va.) The gentleman from Pennsylvania, (Mr.\r\nFitzsimons) has put this question on its proper ground. If gentlemen\r\ndo not mean to oppose the commitment to-morrow, they may as well\r\nacquiesce in it to-day; and I apprehend gentlemen need not be alarmed\r\nat any measure it is likely Congress should take; because they will\r\nrecollect, that the Constitution secures to the individual States the\r\nright of admitting, if they think proper, the importation of slaves\r\ninto their own territory, for eighteen years yet unexpired; subject,\r\nhowever, to a tax, if Congress are disposed to impose it, of not more\r\nthan ten dollars on each person.\r\n\r\nThe petition, if I mistake not, speaks of artifices used by\r\nself-interested persons to carry on this trade; and the petition from\r\nNew York states a case, that may require the consideration of\r\nCongress. If anything is within the Federal authority to restrain such\r\nviolation of the rights of nations, and of mankind, as is supposed to\r\nbe practised in some parts of the United States it will certainly tend\r\nto the interest and honor of the community to attempt a remedy, and is\r\na proper subject for our discussion. It may be, that foreigners take\r\nthe advantage of the liberty afforded them by the American trade, to\r\nemploy our shipping in the slave trade between Africa and the West\r\nIndies, when they are restrained from employing their own by\r\nrestrictive laws of their nation. If this is the case, is there any\r\nperson of humanity that would not wish to prevent them? Another\r\nconsideration why we should commit the petition is, that we may give\r\nno ground of alarm by a serious opposition, as if we were about to\r\ntake measures that were unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone (of Md.) feared that if Congress took any measures,\r\nindicative of an intention to interfere with the kind of property\r\nalluded to, it would sink it in value very considerably, and might be\r\ninjurious to a great number of the citizens, particularly in the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\nHe thought the subject was of general concern, and that the\r\npetitioners had no more right to interfere with it than any other\r\nmembers of the community. It was an unfortunate circumstance, that it\r\nwas the property of sects to imagine they understood the rights of\r\nhuman nature letter than all the world beside; and that they would, in\r\nconsequence, be meddling with concerns in which they had nothing to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nAs the petition relates to a subject of a general nature, it ought to\r\nlie on the table, as information; he would never consent to refer\r\npetitions, unless the petitioners were exclusively interested. Suppose\r\nthere was a petition to come before us from a society, praying us to\r\nbe honest in our transactions, or that we should administer the\r\nConstitution according to its intention--what would you do with a\r\npetition of this kind? Certainly it would remain on your table. He\r\nwould, nevertheless, not have it supposed, that the people had not a\r\nright to advise and give their opinion upon public measures; but he\r\nwould not be influenced by that advice or opinion, to take up a\r\nsubject sooner than the convenience of other business would admit.\r\nUnless he changed his sentiments, he would oppose the commitment.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke (of S.C.) thought gentlemen were paying attention to what\r\ndid not deserve it. The men in the gallery had come here to meddle in\r\na business with which they have nothing to do; they were volunteering\r\nit in the cause of others, who neither expected nor desired it. He had\r\na respect for the body of Quakers, but, nevertheless, he did not\r\nbelieve they had more virtue, or religion, than other people, nor\r\nperhaps so much, if they were examined to the bottom, notwithstanding\r\ntheir outward pretences. If their petition is to be noticed, Congress\r\nought to wait till counter applications were made, and then they might\r\nhave the subject more fairly before them. The rights of the Southern\r\nStates ought not to be threatened, and their property endangered, to\r\nplease people who were to be unaffected by the consequences.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartley (of Penn.) thought the memorialists did not deserve to be\r\naspersed for their conduct, if influenced by motives of benignity,\r\nthey solicited the Legislature of the Union to repel, as far as in\r\ntheir power, the increase of a licentious traffic. Nor do they merit\r\ncensure, because their behavior has the appearance of more morality\r\nthan other people's. But it is not for Congress to refuse to hear the\r\napplications of their fellow-citizens, while those applications\r\ncontain nothing unconstitutional or offensive. What is the object of\r\nthe address before us? It is intended to bring before this House a\r\nsubject of great importance to the cause of humanity; there are\r\ncertain facts to be enquired into, and the memorialists are ready to\r\ngive all the information in their power; they are waiting, at a great\r\ndistance from their homes, and wish to return; if, then, it will be\r\nproper to commit the petition to-morrow, it will be equally proper\r\nto-day, for it is conformable to our practice, beside, it will tend to\r\ntheir conveniency.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrance, (of N.Y.) The Gentleman from South Carolina says, the\r\npetitioners are of a society not known in the laws or Constitution.\r\nSir, in all our acts, as well as in the Constitution, we have noticed\r\nthis Society; or why is it that we admit them to affirm, in cases\r\nwhere others are called upon to swear? If we pay this attention to\r\nthem, in one instance, what good reason is there for condemning them\r\nin another? I think the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Stone,) carries\r\nhis apprehensions too far, when he fears that negro-property will fall\r\nin value, by the suppression of the slave-trade: not that I suppose it\r\nimmediately in the power of Congress to abolish a traffic which is a\r\ndisgrace to human nature; but it appears to me, that, if the\r\nimportation was crushed, the value of a slave would be increased\r\ninstead of diminished; however, considerations of this kind have\r\nnothing to do with the present question; gentlemen may acquiesce in\r\nthe commitment of the memorial, without pledging themselves to support\r\nits object.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson, (of Ga.) I differ much in opinion with the gentleman last\r\nup. I apprehend if, through the interference of the general\r\ngovernment, the slave-trade was abolished, it would evince to the\r\npeople a disposition toward a total emancipation, and they would hold\r\ntheir property in jeopardy. Any extraordinary attention of Congress to\r\nthis petition may have, in some degree, a similar effect. I would beg\r\nto ask those, then, who are so desirous of freeing the negroes, if\r\nthey have funds sufficient to pay for them? If they have, they may\r\ncome forward on that business with some propriety; but, if they have\r\nnot, they should keep themselves quiet, and not interfere with a\r\nbusiness in which they are not interested. They may as well come\r\nforward, and solicit Congress to interdict the West-India trade,\r\nbecause it is injurious to the morals of mankind; from thence we\r\nimport rum, which has a debasing influence upon the consumer. But,\r\nsir, is the whole morality of the United States confined to the\r\nQuakers? Are they the only people whose feelings are to be consulted\r\non this occasion? Is it to them we owe our present happiness? Was it\r\nthey who formed the Constitution? Did they, by their arms, or\r\ncontributions, establish our independence? I believe they were\r\ngenerally opposed to that measure. Why, then, on their application,\r\nshall we injure men, who, at the risk of their lives and fortunes,\r\nsecured to the community their liberty and property? If Congress pay\r\nany uncommon degree of attention to their petition, it will furnish\r\njust ground of alarm to the Southern States. But, why do these men set\r\nthemselves up, in such a particular manner, against slavery? Do they\r\nunderstand the rights of mankind, and the disposition of Providence\r\nbetter than others? If they were to consult that Book which claims our\r\nregard, they will find that slavery is not only allowed, but\r\ncommended. Their Saviour, who possessed more benevolence and\r\ncommiseration than they pretend to, has allowed of it. And if they\r\nfully examine the subject, they will find that slavery has been no\r\nnovel doctrine since the days of Cain. But be these things as they\r\nmay, I hope the house will order the petition to lie on the table, in\r\norder to prevent alarming our Southern brethren.\r\n\r\nMr. Sedgwick, (of Mass.) If it was a serious question, whether the\r\nMemorial should be committed or not, I would not urge it at this time;\r\nbut that cannot be a question for a moment, if we consider our\r\nrelative situation with the people. A number of men,--who are\r\ncertainly very respectable, and of whom, as a society, it may be said\r\nwith truth, that they conform their moral conduct to their religious\r\ntenets, as much as any people in the whole community,--come forward\r\nand tell you, that you may effect two objects by the exercise of a\r\nConstitutional authority which will give great satisfaction; on the\r\none hand you may acquire revenue, and on the other, restrain a\r\npractice productive of great evil. Now, setting aside the religious\r\nmotives which influenced their application, have they not a right, as\r\ncitizens, to give their opinion of public measures? For my part I do\r\nnot apprehend that any State, or any considerable number of\r\nindividuals in any State, will be seriously alarmed at the commitment\r\nof the petition, from a fear that Congress intend to exercise an\r\nunconstitutional authority, in order to violate their rights; I\r\nbelieve there is not a wish of the kind entertained by any member of\r\nthis body. How can gentlemen hesitate then to pay that respect to a\r\nmemorial which it is entitled to, according to the ordinary mode of\r\nprocedure in business? Why shall we defer doing that till to-morrow,\r\nwhich we can do to-day? for the result, I apprehend, will be the same\r\nin either case.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith, (of S.C.) The question, I apprehend, is, whether we will\r\ntake the petition up for a second reading, and not whether it shall be\r\ncommitted? Now, I oppose this, because it is contrary to our usual\r\npractice, and does not allow gentlemen time to consider of the merits\r\nof the prayer; perhaps some gentlemen may think it improper to commit\r\nit to so large a committee as has been mentioned; a variety of causes\r\nmay be supposed to show that such a hasty decision is improper;\r\nperhaps the prayer of it is improper. If I understood it right, on its\r\nfirst reading, though, to be sure, I did not comprehend perfectly all\r\nthat the petition contained, it prays that we should take measures for\r\nthe abolition of the slave trade; this is desiring an unconstitutional\r\nact, because the constitution secures that trade to the States,\r\nindependent of congressional restrictions, for the term of twenty-one\r\nyears. If, therefore, it prays for a violation of constitutional\r\nrights, it ought to be rejected, as an attempt upon the virtue and\r\npatriotism of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Boudinot, (of N.J.) It has been said that the Quakers have no\r\nright to interfere in this business; I am surprised to hear this\r\ndoctrine advanced, after it has been so lately contended, and settled,\r\nthat the people have a right to assemble and petition for redress of\r\ngrievances; it is not because the petition comes from the society of\r\nQuakers that I am in favor of the commitment, but because it comes\r\nfrom citizens of the United States, who are as equally concerned in\r\nthe welfare and happiness of their country as others. There certainly\r\nis no foundation for the apprehensions which seem to prevail in\r\ngentlemen's minds. If the petitioners were so uninformed as to suppose\r\nthat congress could be guilty of a violation of the constitution, yet,\r\nI trust we know our duty better than to be led astray by an\r\napplication from any man, or set of men whatever. I do not consider\r\nthe merits of the main question to be before us; it will be time\r\nenough to give our opinions upon that, when the committee have\r\nreported. If it is in our power, by recommendation, or any other way,\r\nto put a stop to the slave-trade in America, I do not doubt of its\r\npolicy; but how far the constitution will authorize us to attempt to\r\ndepress it, will be a question well worthy of our consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman (of Conn.) observed, that the petitioners from New York,\r\nstated that they had applied to the legislature of that State, to\r\nprohibit certain practices which they conceived to be improper, and\r\nwhich tended to injure the well-being of the community; that the\r\nlegislature had considered the application, but had applied no remedy,\r\nbecause they supposed that power was exclusively vested in the general\r\ngovernment, under the constitution of the United States; it would,\r\ntherefore, be proper to commit that petition, in order to ascertain\r\nwhat were the powers of the general government, in the case doubted by\r\nthe legislature of New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerry (of Mass.) thought gentlemen were out of order in entering\r\nupon the merits of the main question at this time, when they were\r\nconsidering the expediency of committing the petition; he should,\r\ntherefore, now follow them further in that track than barely to\r\nobserve, that it was the right of the citizens to apply for redress,\r\nin every case they conceived themselves aggrieved in; and it was the\r\nduty of congress to afford redress as far as in their power. That\r\ntheir Southern brethren had been betrayed into the slave-trade by the\r\nfirst settlers, was to be lamented; they were not to be reflected on\r\nfor not viewing this subject in a different light, the prejudice of\r\neducation is eradicated with difficulty; but he thought nothing would\r\nexcuse the general government for not exerting itself to prevent, as\r\nfar as they constitutionally could, the evils resulting from such\r\nenormities as were alluded to by the petitioners; and the same\r\nconsiderations induced him highly to commend the part the society of\r\nFriends had taken; it was the cause of humanity they had interested\r\nthemselves in, and he wished, with them, to see measures pursued by\r\nevery nation, to wipe off the indelible stain which the slave-trade\r\nhad brought upon all who were concerned in it.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison (of Va.) thought the question before the committee was no\r\notherwise important than as gentlemen made it so by their serious\r\nopposition. Did they permit the commitment of the Memorial, as a\r\nmatter of course, no notice would be taken of it out of doors; it\r\ncould never be blown up into a decision of the question respecting the\r\ndiscouragement of the African slave-trade, nor alarm the owners with\r\nan apprehension that the general government were about to abolish\r\nslavery in all the States; such things are not contemplated by any\r\ngentleman; but, to appearance, they decide the question more against\r\nthemselves than would be the case if it was determined on its real\r\nmerits, because gentlemen may be disposed to vote for the commitment\r\nof a petition, without any intention of supporting the prayer of it.\r\n\r\nMr. White (of Va.) would not have seconded the motion, if he had\r\nthought it would have brought on a lengthy debate. He conceived that a\r\nbusiness of this kind ought to be decided without much discussion; it\r\nhad constantly been the practice of the house, and he did not suppose\r\nthere was any reason for a deviation.\r\n\r\nMr. Page (of Va.) said, if the memorial had been presented by any\r\nindividual, instead of the respectable body it was, he should have\r\nvoted in favor of a commitment, because it was the duty of the\r\nlegislature to attend to subjects brought before them by their\r\nconstituents; if, upon inquiry, it was discovered to be improper to\r\ncomply with the prayer of the petitioners, he would say so, and they\r\nwould be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone (of Md.) thought the business ought to be left to take its\r\nusual course; by the rules of the house, it was expressly declared,\r\nthat petitions, memorials, and other papers, addressed to the house,\r\nshould not be debated or decided on the day they were first read.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin (of Ga.) felt at a loss to account why precipitation was\r\nused on this occasion, contrary to the customary usage of the house;\r\nhe had not heard a single reason advanced in favor of it. To be sure\r\nit was said the petitioners are a respectable body of men--he did not\r\ndeny it--but, certainly, gentlemen did not suppose they were paying\r\nrespect to them, or to the house, when they urged such a hasty\r\nprocedure; anyhow it was contrary to his idea of respect, and the idea\r\nthe house had always expressed, when they had important subjects under\r\nconsideration; and, therefore, he should be against the motion. He was\r\nafraid that there was really a little volunteering in this business,\r\nas it had been termed by the gentleman from Georgia.\r\n\r\nMr. Huntington (of Conn.) considered the petitioners as much\r\ndisinterested as any person in the United States; he was persuaded\r\nthey had an aversion to slavery; yet they were not singular in this,\r\nothers had the same; and he hoped when congress took up the subject,\r\nthey would go as far as possible to prohibit the evil complained of.\r\nBut he thought that would better be done by considering it in the\r\nlight of revenue. When the committee of the whole, on the finance\r\nbusiness, came to the ways and means, it might properly be taken into\r\nconsideration, without giving any ground for alarm.\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker, (of S.C.) I have no doubt on my mind respecting what ought\r\nto be done on this occasion; so far from committing the memorial, we\r\nought to dismiss it without further notice. What is the purport of the\r\nmemorial? It is plainly this; to reprobate a particular kind of\r\ncommerce, in a moral view, and to request the interposition of\r\ncongress to effect its abrogation. But congress have no authority,\r\nunder the constitution, to do more than lay a duty of ten dollars upon\r\neach person imported; and this is a political consideration, not\r\narising from either religion or morality, and is the only principle\r\nupon which we can proceed to take it up. But what effect do these men\r\nsuppose will arise from their exertions? Will a duty of ten dollars\r\ndiminish the importation? Will the treatment be better than usual? I\r\napprehend it will not, nay, it may be worse. Because an interference\r\nwith the subject may excite a great degree of restlessness in the\r\nminds of those it is intended to serve, and that may be a cause for\r\nthe masters to use more rigor towards them, than they would otherwise\r\nexert; so that these men seem to overshoot their object. But if they\r\nwill endeavor to procure the abolition of the slave-trade, let them\r\nprefer their petitions to the State legislatures, who alone have the\r\npower of forbidding the importation; I believe their applications\r\nthere would be improper; but if they are any where proper, it is\r\nthere. I look upon the address then to be ill-judged, however good the\r\nintention of the framers.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith (of S.C.) claimed it as a right, that the petition should\r\nlay over till to-morrow.\r\n\r\nMr. Boudinor (of N.J.) said it was not unusual to commit petitions on\r\nthe day they were presented; and the rules of the house admitted the\r\npractice, by the qualification which followed the positive order, that\r\npetitions should not be decided on the day they were first read,\r\n\"unless where the house shall direct otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith (of S.C.) declared his intention of calling the yeas and\r\nnays, if gentlemen persisted in pressing the question.\r\n\r\nMr. Clymer (of Penn.) hoped the motion would be withdrawn for the\r\npresent, and the business taken up in course to-morrow; because,\r\nthough he respected the memorialists, he also respected order and the\r\nsituation of the members.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzsimons (of Penn.) did not recollect whether he moved or\r\nseconded the motion, but if he had, he should not withdraw it on\r\naccount of the threat of calling the yeas and nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin (of Ga.) hoped the business would be conducted with temper\r\nand moderation, and that gentlemen would concede and pass the subject\r\nover a day at least.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith (of S.C.) had no idea of holding out a threat to any\r\ngentleman. If the declaration of an intention to call the yeas and\r\nnays was viewed by gentlemen in that light, he would withdraw that\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nMr. White (of Va.) hereupon withdrew his motion. And the address was\r\nordered to lie on the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 12th, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe following memorial was presented and read:\r\n\r\n\"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: The\r\nMemorial of the Pennsylvania Society for promoting the abolition of\r\nslavery, the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage, and\r\nthe improvement of the condition of the African race, respectfully\r\nshoweth: That from a regard for the happiness of mankind, an\r\nassociation was formed several years since in this State, by a number\r\nof her citizens, of various religious denominations, for promoting the\r\nabolition of slavery, and for the relief of those unlawfully held in\r\nbondage. A just and acute conception of the true principles of\r\nliberty, as it spread through the land, produced accessions to their\r\nnumbers, many friends to their cause, and a legislative co-operation\r\nwith their views, which, by the blessing of Divine Providence, have\r\nbeen successfully directed to the relieving from bondage a large\r\nnumber of their fellow creatures of the African race. They have also\r\nthe satisfaction to observe, that, in consequence of that spirit of\r\nphilanthropy and genuine liberty which is generally diffusing its\r\nbeneficial influence, similar institutions are forming at home and\r\nabroad. That mankind are all formed by the same Almighty Being, alike\r\nobjects of his care, and equally designed for the enjoyment of\r\nhappiness, the Christian religion teaches us to believe, and the\r\npolitical creed of Americans fully coincides with the position. Your\r\nmemorialists, particularly engaged in attending to the distresses\r\narising from slavery, believe it their indispensable duty to present\r\nthis subject to your notice. They have observed with real\r\nsatisfaction, that many important and salutary powers are vested in\r\nyou for 'promoting the welfare and securing the blessings of liberty\r\nto the people of the United States;' and as they conceive, that these\r\nblessings ought rightfully to be administered, without distinction of\r\ncolor, to all descriptions of people, so they indulge themselves in\r\nthe pleasing expectation, that nothing which can be done for the\r\nrelief of the unhappy objects of their care, will be either omitted or\r\ndelayed. From a persuasion that equal liberty was originally the\r\nportion, and is still the birth-right of all men, and influenced by\r\nthe strong ties of humanity and the principles of their institution,\r\nyour memorialists conceived themselves bound to use all justifiable\r\nendeavors to loosen the bands of slavery, and promote a general\r\nenjoyment of the blessings of freedom. Under these impressions, they\r\nearnestly entreat your serious attention to the subject of slavery;\r\nthat you will be pleased to countenance the restoration of liberty to\r\nthose unhappy men, who alone, in this land of freedom, are degraded\r\ninto perpetual bondage, and who, amidst the general joy of surrounding\r\nfreemen, are groaning in servile subjection; that you will devise\r\nmeans for removing this inconsistency from the character of the\r\nAmerican people; that you will promote mercy and justice towards this\r\ndistressed race, and that you will step to the very verge of the power\r\nvested in you, for discouraging every species of traffic in the\r\npersons of our fellow-men.\r\n\r\n\"BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, _President_.\r\n\r\n\"PHILADELPHIA, _February_ 3, 1790.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hartley (of Penn.) then called up the memorial presented\r\nyesterday, from the annual meeting of Friends at Philadelphia, for a\r\nsecond reading; whereupon the same was read a second time, and moved\r\nto be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker (of S.C.) was sorry the petition had a second reading as he\r\nconceived it contained an unconstitutional request, and from that\r\nconsideration he wished it thrown aside. He feared the commitment of\r\nit would be a very alarming circumstance to the Southern States; for\r\nif the object was to engage Congress in an unconstitutional measure,\r\nit would be considered as an interference with their rights, the\r\npeople would become very uneasy under the government, and lament that\r\nthey ever put additional powers into their hands. He was surprised to\r\nsee another memorial on the same subject and that signed by a man who\r\nought to have known the constitution better. He thought it a\r\nmischievous attempt, as it respected the persons in whose favor it was\r\nintended. It would buoy them up with hopes, without a foundation, and\r\nas they could not reason on the subject, as more enlightened men\r\nwould, they might be led to do what they would be punished for, and\r\nthe owners of them, in their own defence, would be compelled to\r\nexercise over them a severity they were not accustomed to. Do these\r\nmen expect a general emancipation of slaves by law? This would never\r\nbe submitted to by the Southern States without a civil war. Do they\r\nmean to purchase their freedom? He believed their money would fall\r\nshort of the price. But how is it they are more concerned in this\r\nbusiness than others? Are they the only persons who possess religion\r\nand morality? If the people are not so exemplary, certainly they will\r\nadmit the clergy are; why then do we not find them uniting in a body,\r\npraying us to adopt measures for the promotion of religion and piety,\r\nor any moral object? They know it would be an improper interference;\r\nand to say the best of this memorial, it is an act of imprudence,\r\nwhich he hoped would receive no countenance from the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Seney (of Md.) denied that there was anything unconstitutional in\r\nthe memorial, at least, if there was, it had escaped his attention,\r\nand he should be obliged to the gentleman to point it out. Its only\r\nobject was, that congress should exercise their constitutional\r\nauthority, to abate the horrors of slavery, as far as they could:\r\nIndeed, he considered that all altercation on the subject of\r\ncommitment was at an end, as the house had impliedly determined\r\nyesterday that it should be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke (of S.C.) saw the disposition of the house, and he feared it\r\nwould be refered to a committee, maugre all their opposition; but he\r\nmust insist that it prayed for an unconstitutional measure. Did it not\r\ndesire congress to interfere and abolish the slave-trade, while the\r\nconstitution expressly stipulated that congress should exercise no\r\nsuch power? He was certain the commitment would sound in alarm, and\r\nblow the trumpet of sedition in the Southern States. He was sorry to\r\nsee the petitioners paid more attention to than the constitution;\r\nhowever, he would do his duty, and oppose the business totally; and if\r\nit was referred to a committee, as mentioned yesterday, consisting of\r\na member from each State, and he was appointed, he would decline\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott, (of Penn.) I can't entertain a doubt but the memorial duty\r\nparticularly assigned to us by that instrument, and I hope we may be\r\ninclined to take it into consideration. We can, at present, lay our\r\nhands upon a small duty of ten dollars. I would take this, and if it\r\nis all we can do, we must be content. But I am sorry that the framers\r\nof the constitution did not go farther and enable us to interdict it\r\nfor good and all; for I look upon the slave-trade to be one of the\r\nmost abominable things on earth; and if there was neither God nor\r\ndevil, I should oppose it upon the principles of humanity and the law\r\nof nature. I cannot, for my part, conceive how any person can be said\r\nto acquire a property in another; is it by virtue of conquest? What\r\nare the rights of conquest? Some have dared to advance this monstrous\r\nprinciple, that the conqueror is absolute master of his conquest; that\r\nhe may dispose of it as his property, and treat it as he pleases; but\r\nenough of those who reduce men to the state of transferable goods, or\r\nuse them like beasts of burden; who deliver them up as the property or\r\npatrimony of another man. Let us argue on principles countenanced by\r\nreason and becoming humanity; the petitioners view the subject in a\r\nreligious light, but I do not stand in need of religious motives to\r\ninduce me to reprobate the traffic in human flesh; other\r\nconsiderations weigh with me to support the commitment of the\r\nmemorial, and to support every constitutional measure likely to bring\r\nabout its total abolition. Perhaps, in our legislative capacity, we\r\ncan go no further than to impose a duty of ten dollars, but I do not\r\nknow how far I might go, if I was one of the judges of the United\r\nStates, and those people were to come before me and claim their\r\nemancipation; but I am sure I would go as far as I could.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson (of Ga.) differed with the gentleman last up, and supposed\r\nthe master had a qualified property in his slave; he said the contrary\r\ndoctrine would go to the destruction of every species of personal\r\nservice. The gentleman said he did not stand in need of religion to\r\ninduce him to reprobate slavery, but if he is guided by that evidence,\r\nwhich the Christian system is founded upon, he will find that religion\r\nis not against it; he will see, from Genesis to Revelation, the\r\ncurrent setting strong that way. There never was a government on the\r\nface of the earth, but what permitted slavery. The purest sons of\r\nfreedom in the Grecian republics, the citizens of Athens and\r\nLacedaemon all held slaves. On this principle the nations of Europe\r\nare associated; it is the basis of the feudal system. But suppose all\r\nthis to have been wrong, let me ask the gentleman, if it is policy to\r\nbring forward a business at this moment, likely to light up a flame of\r\ncivil discord, for the people of the Southern States will resist one\r\ntyranny as soon as another; the other parts of the continent may bear\r\nthem down by force of arms, but they will never suffer themselves to\r\nbe divested of their property without a struggle. The gentleman says,\r\nif he was a federal judge, he does not know to what length he would go\r\nin emancipating these people; but, I believe his judgment would be of\r\nshort duration in Georgia; perhaps even the existence of such a judge\r\nmight be in danger.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman (of Conn.) could see no difficulty in committing the\r\nmemorial; because it was probable the committee would understand their\r\nbusiness, and perhaps they might bring in such a report as would be\r\nsatisfactory to gentlemen on both sides of the House.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin (of Ga.) was sorry the subject had ever been brought\r\nbefore Congress, because it was a delicate nature, as it respected\r\nsome of the States. Gentlemen who had been present at the formation of\r\nthis Constitution, could not avoid the recollection of the pain and\r\ndifficulty which the subject caused in that body; the members from the\r\nSouthern States were so tender upon this point, that they had well\r\nnigh broken up without coming to any determination; however, from the\r\nextreme desire of preserving the Union, and obtaining an efficient\r\ngovernment, they were induced mutually, to concede, and the\r\nConstitution jealously guarded what they agreed to. If gentlemen look\r\nover the footsteps of that body, they will find the greatest degree of\r\ncaution used to imprint them, so as not to be easily eradicated; but\r\nthe moment we go to jostle on that ground, said he, I fear we shall\r\nfeel it tremble under our feet. Congress have no power to interfere\r\nwith the importation of slaves, beyond what is given in the 9th\r\nsection of the first article of the Constitution; every thing else is\r\ninterdicted to them in the strongest terms. If we examine the\r\nConstitution, we shall find the expressions, relative to this subject,\r\ncautiously expressed, and more punctiliously guarded than any other\r\npart. \"The migration or importation of such persons, shall not be\r\nprohibited by Congress.\" But lest this should not have secured the\r\nobject sufficiently, it is declared in the same section, \"That no\r\ncapitation or direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the\r\ncensus;\" this was intended to prevent Congress from laying any special\r\ntax upon negro slaves, as they might, in this way, so burthen the\r\npossessors of them, as to induce a general emancipation. If we go on\r\nto the 5th article, we shall find the 1st and 5th clauses of the 9th\r\nsection of the 1st article restrained from being altered before the\r\nyear 1808.\r\n\r\nGentlemen have said, that this petition does not pray for an abolition\r\nof the slave-trade; I think, sir, it prays for nothing else, and\r\ntherefore we have no more to do with it, than if it prayed us to\r\nestablish an order of nobility, or a national religion.\r\n\r\nMr. Sylvester of (N.Y.) said that he had always been in the habit of\r\nrespecting the society called Quakers; he respected them for their\r\nexertions in the cause of humanity, but he thought the present was not\r\na time to enter into a consideration of the subject, especially as he\r\nconceived it to be a business in the province of the State\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrance of (of N.Y.) observed that the subject would undoubtedly\r\ncome under the consideration of the House; and he thought, that as it\r\nwas now before them, that the present time was as proper as any; he\r\nwas therefore for committing the memorial; and when the prayer of it\r\nhad been properly examined, they could see how far congress may\r\nconstitutionally interfere; as they knew the limits of their power on\r\nthis, as well as on every other occasion, there was no just\r\napprehension to be entertained that they would go beyond them.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith (of S.C.) insisted that it was not in the power of the House\r\nto grant the prayer of the petition, which went to the total\r\nabolishment of the slave trade, and it was therefore unnecessary to\r\ncommit it. He observed, that in the Southern States, difficulties had\r\narisen on adopting the Constitution, inasmuch as it was apprehended,\r\nthat Congress might take measures under it for abolishing the\r\nslave-trade.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the petitioners, when they applied to this house, did not\r\nthink their object unconstitutional, but now they are told that it is,\r\nthey will be satisfied with the answer, and press it no further. If\r\ntheir object had been for Congress to lay a duty of ten dollars per\r\nhead on the importation of slaves, they would have said so, but that\r\ndoes not appear to have been the case; the commitment of the petition,\r\non that ground, cannot be contended; if they will not be content with\r\nthat, shall it be committed to investigate facts? The petition speaks\r\nof none; for what purpose then shall it be committed? If gentlemen can\r\nassign no good reason for the measure, they will not support it, when\r\nthey are told that it will create great jealousies and alarm in the\r\nSouthern States; for I can assure them, that there is no point on\r\nwhich they are more jealous and suspicious, than on a business with\r\nwhich they think the government has nothing to do.\r\n\r\nWhen we entered into this Confederacy, we did it from political, not\r\nfrom moral motives, and I do not think my constituents want to learn\r\nmorals from the petitioners; I do not believe they want improvement in\r\ntheir moral system; if they do, they can get it at home.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Georgia, has justly stated the jealousy of the\r\nSouthern States. On entering into this government, they apprehended\r\nthat the other States, not knowing the necessity the citizens of the\r\nSouthern States were under to hold this species of property, would,\r\nfrom motives of humanity and benevolence, be led to vote for a general\r\nemancipation; and had they not seen that the Constitution provided\r\nagainst the effect of such a disposition, I may be bold to say, they\r\nnever would have adopted it. And notwithstanding all the calmness with\r\nwhich some gentlemen have viewed the subject, they will find, that the\r\ndiscussion alone will create great alarm. We have been told, that if\r\nthe discussion will create alarm, we ought to have avoided it, by\r\nsaying nothing; but it was not for that purpose that we were sent\r\nhere, we look upon this measure as an attack upon the palladium of the\r\nproperty of our country; it is therefore our duty to oppose it by\r\nevery means in our power. Gentlemen should consider that when we\r\nentered into a political connexion with the other States, that this\r\nproperty was there; it was acquired under a former government,\r\nconformably to the laws and Constitution; therefore anything that will\r\ntend to deprive them of that property, must be an _ex post facto_ law,\r\nand as such is forbid by our political compact.\r\n\r\nI said the States would never have entered into the confederation,\r\nunless their property had been guaranteed to them, for such is the\r\nstate of agriculture in that country, that without slaves it must be\r\ndepopulated. Why will these people then make use of arguments to\r\ninduce the slave to turn his hand against his master? We labor under\r\ndifficulties enough from the ravages of the late war. A gentleman can\r\nhardly come from that country, with a servant or two, either to this\r\nplace or Philadelphia, but what there are persons trying to seduce his\r\nservants to leave him; and, when they have done this, the poor\r\nwretches are obliged to rob their master in order to obtain a\r\nsubsistence; all those, therefore, who are concerned in this\r\nseduction, are accessaries to the robbery.\r\n\r\nThe reproaches which they cast upon the owners of negro property, is\r\ncharging them with the want of humanity; I believe the proprietors are\r\npersons of as much humanity as any part of the continent and are as\r\nconspicuous for their good morals as their neighbors. It was said\r\nyesterday, that the Quakers were a society known to the laws, and the\r\nConstitution, but they are no more so than other religious societies;\r\nthey stand exactly in the same situation; their memorial, therefore,\r\nrelates to a matter in which they are no more interested than any\r\nother sect, and can only be considered as a piece of advice; it is\r\ncustomary to refer a piece of advice to a committee, but if it is\r\nsupposed to pray for what they think a moral purpose, is that\r\nsufficient to induce us to commit it? What may appear a moral virtue\r\nin their eyes, may not be so in reality. I have heard of a sect of\r\nShaking Quakers, who, I presume, suppose their tenets of a moral\r\ntendency; I am informed one of them forbids to intermarry, yet in\r\nconsequence of their shakings and concussions, you may see them with a\r\nnumerous offspring about them. Now, if these people were to petition\r\nCongress to pass a law prohibiting matrimony, I ask, would gentlemen\r\nagree to refer such a petition? I think if they would reject one of\r\nthat nature, as improper, they ought also to reject this.\r\n\r\nMr. Page (of Va.) was in favor of the commitment; he hoped that the\r\ndesigns of the respectable memorialists would not be stopped at the\r\nthreshold, in order to preclude a fair discussion of the prayer of the\r\nmemorial. He observed that gentlemen had founded their arguments upon\r\na misrepresentation; for the object of the memorial was not declared\r\nto be the total abolition of the slave trade: but that Congress would\r\nconsider, whether it be not in reality within their power to exercise\r\njustice and mercy, which, if adhered to, they cannot doubt must\r\nproduce the abolition of the slave trade. If then the prayer contained\r\nnothing unconstitutional, he trusted the meritorious effort would not\r\nbe frustrated. With respect to the alarm that was apprehended, he\r\nconjectured there was none; but there might be just cause, if the\r\nmemorial was not taken into consideration. He placed himself in the\r\ncase of a slave, and said, that, on hearing that Congress had refused\r\nto listen to the decent suggestions of a respectable part of the\r\ncommunity, he should infer, that the general government (from which\r\nwas expected great good would result to every class of citizens) had\r\nshut their ears against the voice of humanity, and he should despair\r\nof any alleviation of the miseries he and his posterity had in\r\nprospect; if any thing could induce him to rebel, it must be a stroke\r\nlike this, impressing on his mind all the horrors of despair. But if\r\nhe was told, that application was made in his behalf, and that\r\nCongress were willing to hear what could be urged in favor of\r\ndiscouraging the practice of importing his fellow-wretches, he would\r\ntrust in their justice and humanity, and wait the decision patiently.\r\nHe presumed that these unfortunate people would reason in the same\r\nway; and he, therefore, conceived the most likely way to prevent\r\ndanger, was to commit the petition. He lived in a State which had the\r\nmisfortune of having in her bosom a great number of slaves, he held\r\nmany of them himself, and was as much interested in the business, he\r\nbelieved, as any gentleman in South Carolina or Georgia, yet, if he\r\nwas determined to hold them in eternal bondage, he should feel no\r\nuneasiness or alarm on account of the present measure, because he\r\nshould rely upon the virtue of Congress, that they would not exercise\r\nany unconstitutional authority.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison (of Va.) The debate has taken a serious turn, and it will\r\nbe owing to this alone if an alarm is created; for had the memorial\r\nbeen treated in the usual way, it would have been considered as a\r\nmatter of course, and a report might have been made, so as to have\r\ngiven general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIf there was the slightest tendency by the commitment to break in upon\r\nthe constitution, he would object to it; but he did not see upon what\r\nground such an event was to be apprehended. The petition prayed, in\r\ngeneral terms, for the interference of congress, so far as they were\r\nconstitutionally authorized; but even if its prayer was, in some\r\ndegree, unconstitutional, it might be committed, as was the case on\r\nMr. Churchman's petition, one part of which was supposed to apply for\r\nan unconstitutional interference by the general government.\r\n\r\nHe admitted that congress was restricted by the constitution from\r\ntaking measures to abolish the slave-trade; yet there were a variety\r\nof ways by which they could countenance the abolition, and they might\r\nmake some regulations respecting the introduction of them into the new\r\nStates, to be formed out of the Western Territory, different from what\r\nthey could in the old settled States. He thought the object well\r\nworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerry (of Mass.) thought the interference of congress fully\r\ncompatible with the constitution, and could not help lamenting the\r\nmiseries to which the tribes of Africa were exposed by this inhuman\r\ncommerce; and said that he never contemplated the subject, without\r\nreflecting what his own feelings would be, in case himself, his\r\nchildren, or friends, were placed in the same deplorable\r\ncircumstances. He then adverted to the flagrant acts of cruelty which\r\nare committed in carrying on that traffic; and asked whether it can be\r\nsupposed, that congress has no power to prevent such transactions? He\r\nthen referred to the constitution, and pointed out the restrictions\r\nlaid on the general government respecting the importation of slaves.\r\nIt was not, he presumed, in the contemplation of any gentleman in this\r\nhouse to violate that part of the constitution; but that we have a\r\nright to regulate this business, is as clear as that we have any\r\nrights whatever; nor has the contrary been shown by any person who has\r\nspoken on the occasion. Congress can, agreeable to the constitution,\r\nlay a duty of ten dollars on imported slaves; they may do this\r\nimmediately. He made a calculation of the value of the slaves in the\r\nSouthern States, and supposed they might be worth ten millions of\r\ndollars; congress have a right, if they see proper, to make a proposal\r\nto the Southern States to purchase the whole of them, and their\r\nresources in the Western Territory may furnish them with means. He did\r\nnot intend to suggest a measure of this kind, he only instanced these\r\nparticulars, to show that congress certainly have a right to\r\nintermeddle in the business. He thought that no objection had been\r\noffered, of any force, to prevent the commitment of the memorial.\r\n\r\nMr. Boudinot (of N.J.) had carefully examined the petition, and found\r\nnothing like what was complained of by gentlemen, contained in it; he,\r\ntherefore, hoped they would withdraw their opposition, and suffer it\r\nto be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith (of S.C.) said, that as the petitioners had particularly\r\nprayed congress to take measures for the annihilation of the slave\r\ntrade, and that was admitted on all hands to be beyond their power,\r\nand as the petitioners would not be gratified by a tax of ten dollars\r\nper head, which was all that was within their power, there was, of\r\nconsequence, no occasion for committing it.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone (of Md.) thought this memorial a thing of course; for there\r\nnever was a society, of any considerable extent, which did not\r\ninterfere with the concerns of other people, and this kind of\r\ninterference, whenever it has happened, has never failed to deluge the\r\ncountry in blood: on this principle he was opposed to the commitment.\r\n\r\nThe question on the commitment being about to be put, the yeas and\r\nnays were called for, and are as follows:--\r\n\r\nYeas.--Messrs. Ames, Benson, Boudinot, Brown, Cadwallader, Clymer,\r\nFitzsimons, Floyd, Foster, Gale, Gerry, Gilman, Goodhue, Griffin,\r\nGrout, Hartley, Hathorne, Heister, Huntington, Lawrence, Lee, Leonard,\r\nLivermore, Madison, Moore, Muhlenberg, Pale, Parker, Partridge,\r\nRenssellaer, Schureman, Scott, Sedgwick, Seney, Sherman, Sinnickson,\r\nSmith of Maryland, Sturges, Thatcher, Trumbull, Wadsworth, White, and\r\nWynkoop--43.\r\n\r\nNoes--Messrs. Baldwin, Bland, Bourke, Coles, Huger, Jackson, Mathews,\r\nSylvester, Smith of S.C., Stone, and Tucker--11.\r\n\r\nWhereupon it was determined in the affirmative; and on motion, the\r\npetition of the Society of Friends, at New York, and the memorial from\r\nthe Pennsylvania Society, for the abolition of slavery, were also\r\nreferred to a committee.--LLOYD'S DEBATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Debate on Committee's Report, March_, 1790.\r\n\r\nELIOT'S DEBATES.\r\n\r\nMr. Tucker moved to modify the first paragraph by striking out all the\r\nwords after the word opinion, and to insert the following: that the\r\nseveral memorials proposed to the consideration of this house, a\r\nsubject on which its interference would be unconstitutional, and even\r\nits deliberations highly injurious to some of the States in the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson rose and observed, that he had been silent on the subject\r\nof the reports coming before the committee, because he wished the\r\nprinciples of the resolutions to be examined fairly, and to be decided\r\non their true grounds. He was against the propositions generally, and\r\nwould examine the policy, the justice and the use of them, and he\r\nhoped, if he could make them appear in the same light to others as\r\nthey did to him by fair argument, that the gentlemen in opposition\r\nwere not so determined in their opinions as not to give up their\r\npresent sentiments.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the policy of the measure, the situation of the slaves\r\nhere, their situation in their native States, and the disposal of them\r\nin case of emancipation, should be considered. That slavery was an\r\nevil habit, he did not mean to controvert; but that habit was already\r\nestablished, and there were peculiar situations in countries which\r\nrendered that habit necessary. Such situations the States of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia were in--large tracts of the most fertile lands\r\non the continent remained uncultivated for the want of population. It\r\nwas frequently advanced on the floor of Congress, how unhealthy those\r\nclimates were, and how impossible it was for northern constitutions to\r\nexist there. What, he asked, is to be done with this uncultivated\r\nterritory? Is it to remain a waste? Is the rice trade to be banished\r\nfrom our coasts? Are congress willing to deprive themselves of the\r\nrevenue arising from that trade, and which is daily increasing, and to\r\nthrow this great advantage into the hands of other countries?\r\n\r\nLet us examine the use or the benefit of the resolutions contained in\r\nthe report. I call upon gentlemen to give me one single instance in\r\nwhich they can be of service. They are of no use to congress. The\r\npowers of that body are already defined, and those powers cannot be\r\namended, confirmed or diminished by ten thousand resolutions. Is not\r\nthat the guide and rule of this legislature. A multiplicity of laws is\r\nreprobated in any society, and tend but to confound and perplex. How\r\nstrange would a law appear which was to confirm a law; and how much\r\nmore strange must it appear for this body to pass resolutions to\r\nconfirm the constitution under which they sit! This is the case with\r\nothers of the resolutions.\r\n\r\nA gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Stone) very properly observed, that the\r\nUnion had received the different States with all their ill habits\r\nabout them. This was one of these habits established long before the\r\nconstitution, and could not now be remedied. He begged congress to\r\nreflect on the number on the continent who were opposed to this\r\nconstitution, and on the number which yet remained in the Southern\r\nStates. The violation of this compact they would seize on with\r\navidity; they would make a handle of it to cover their designs against\r\nthe government, and many good federalists, who would be injured by the\r\nmeasure, would be induced to join them: his heart was truly federal,\r\nand it had always been so, and he wished those designs frustrated. He\r\nbegged congress to beware before they went too far: he called on them\r\nto attend to the interest of two whole States, as well as to the\r\nmemorials of a society of quakers, who came forward to blow the\r\ntrumpet of sedition, and to destroy that constitution which they had\r\nnot in the least contributed by personal service or supply to\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\nHe seconded Mr. Tucker's motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith (of S.C.) said, the gentleman from Massachusetts, (Mr.\r\nGerry,) had declared that it was the opinion of the select committee,\r\nof which he was a member, that the memorial of the Pennsylvania\r\nsociety, required congress to violate the constitution. It was not\r\nless astonishing to see Dr. Franklin taking the lead in a business\r\nwhich looks so much like a persecution of the Southern inhabitants,\r\nwhen he recollected the parable he had written some time ago, with a\r\nview of showing the immorality of one set of men persecuting others\r\nfor a difference of opinion. The parable was to this effect: an old\r\ntraveller, hungry and weary, applied to the patriarch Abraham for a\r\nnight's lodging. In conversation, Abraham discovered that the stranger\r\ndiffered with him on religious points, and turned him out of doors. In\r\nthe night God appeared unto Abraham, and said, where is the stranger?\r\nAbraham answered, I found that he did not worship the true God, and so\r\nI turned him out of doors. The Almighty thus rebuked the patriarch:\r\nhave I borne with him three-score and ten years, and couldst thou not\r\nbear with him one night? Has the Almighty, said Mr. Smith, borne with\r\nus for more than three-score years and ten: He has even made our\r\ncountry opulent, and shed the blessings of affluence and prosperity on\r\nour land, notwithstanding all its slaves, and must we now be ruined\r\non account of the tender consciences of a few scrupulous individuals\r\nwho differ from us on this point?\r\n\r\nMr. Boudinot agreed with the general doctrines of Mr. S., but could\r\nnot agree that the clause in the constitution relating to the want of\r\npower in congress to prohibit the importation of such persons as any\r\nof the States, _now existing_, shall think proper to admit, prior to\r\nthe year 1808, and authorizing a tax or duty on such importation not\r\nexceeding ten dollars for each person, did not extend to negro slaves.\r\nCandor required that he should acknowledge that this was the express\r\ndesign of the constitution, and therefore congress could not interfere\r\nin prohibiting the importation or promoting the emancipation of them,\r\nprior to that period. Mr. Boudinot observed, that he was well informed\r\nthat the tax or duty of ten dollars was provided, instead of the five\r\nper cent. ad valorem, and was so expressly understood by all parties\r\nin the convention; that therefore it was the interest and duty of\r\ncongress to impose this tax, or it would not be doing justice to the\r\nStates, or equalizing the duties throughout the Union. If this was\r\nnot done, merchants might bring their whole capitals into this branch\r\nof trade, and save paying any duties whatever. Mr. Boudinot observed,\r\nthat the gentleman had overlooked the prophecy of St. Peter, where he\r\nforetells that among other damnable heresies, \"Through covetousness\r\nshall they with feigned words make merchandize of you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--This petition, with others of a similar object, was committed\r\nto a select committee; that committee made a report; the report was\r\nreferred to a committee of the whole house, and discussed on four\r\nsuccessive days; it was then reported to the House with amendments,\r\nand by the House ordered to be inscribed in its Journals, and then\r\nlaid on the table.\r\n\r\nThat report, as amended in committee, is in the following words: The\r\ncommittee to whom were referred sundry memorials from the people\r\ncalled Quakers, and also a memorial from the Pennsylvania Society for\r\npromoting the abolition of slavery, submit the following report, (as\r\namended in committee of the whole.)\r\n\r\n\"First: That the migration or importation of such persons as any of\r\nthe States now existing shall think proper to admit, cannot be\r\nprohibited by Congress prior to the year 1808.\"\r\n\r\n\"Secondly: That Congress have no power to interfere in the\r\nemancipation of slaves, or in the treatment of them, within any of the\r\nStates; it remaining with the several States alone to provide any\r\nregulations therein which humanity and true policy may require.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly: That Congress have authority to restrain the citizens of the\r\nUnited States from carrying on the African Slave trade, for the\r\npurpose of supplying foreigners with slaves, and of providing by\r\nproper regulations for the humane treatment, during their passage, of\r\nslaves imported by the said citizens into the states admitting such\r\nimportations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly: That Congress have also authority to prohibit foreigners\r\nfrom fitting out vessels in any part of the United States for\r\ntransporting persons from Africa to any foreign port.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY\r\nSOCIETY TO THE Friends of Freedom and Emancipation in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAt the Tenth Anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, held in\r\nthe city of New York, May 7th, 1844,--after grave deliberation, and a\r\nlong and earnest discussion,--it was decided, by a vote of nearly\r\nthree to one of the members present, that fidelity to the cause of\r\nhuman freedom, hatred of oppression, sympathy for those who are held\r\nin chains and slavery in this republic, and allegiance to God, require\r\nthat the existing national compact should be instantly dissolved; that\r\nsecession from the government is a religious and political duty; that\r\nthe motto inscribed on the banner of Freedom should be, NO UNION WITH\r\nSLAVEHOLDERS; that it is impracticable for tyrants and the enemies of\r\ntyranny to coalesce and legislate together for the preservation of\r\nhuman rights, or the promotion of the interests of Liberty; and that\r\nrevolutionary ground should be occupied by all those who abhor the\r\nthought of doing evil that good may come, and who do not mean to\r\ncompromise the principles of Justice and humanity.\r\n\r\nA decision involving such momentous consequences, so well calculated\r\nto startle the public mind, so hostile to the established order of\r\nthings, demands of us, as the official representatives of the\r\nAmerican Society, a statement of the reasons which led to it. This is\r\ndue not only to the Society, but also to the country and the world.\r\n\r\nIt is declared by the American people to be a self-evident truth,\r\n\"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed BY THEIR\r\nCREATOR with certain inalienable rights; that among these are _life,_\r\nLIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.\" It is further maintained by\r\nthem, that \"all governments derive their just powers from the consent\r\nof the governed;\" that \"whenever any form of government becomes\r\ndestructive of human rights, it is the right of the people to alter or\r\nto abolish it, and institute a new government, laying its foundation\r\non such principles, and organizing its powers in such form as to them\r\nshall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\" These\r\ndoctrines the patriots of 1776 sealed with their blood. They would\r\nnot brook even the menace of oppression. They held that there should\r\nbe no delay in resisting at whatever cost or peril, the first\r\nencroachments of power on their liberties. Appealing to the great\r\nRuler of the universe for the rectitude of their course, they pledged\r\nto each other \"their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor,\" to\r\nconquer or perish in their struggle to be free.\r\n\r\nFor the example which they set to all people subjected to a despotic\r\nsway, and the sacrifices which they made, their descendants cherish\r\ntheir memories with gratitude, reverence their virtues, honor their\r\ndeeds, and glory in their triumphs.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, therefore, for us to prove that a state of\r\nslavery is incompatible with the dictates of reason and humanity; or\r\nthat it is lawful to throw off a government which is at war with the\r\nsacred rights of mankind.\r\n\r\nWe regard this as indeed a solemn crisis, which requires of every man\r\nsobriety of thought, prophetic forecast, independent judgment,\r\ninvincible determination, and a sound heart. A revolutionary step is\r\none that should not be taken hastily, nor followed under the influence\r\nof impulsive imitation. To know what spirit they are of--whether they\r\nhave counted the cost of the warfare--what are the principles they\r\nadvocate--and how they are to achieve their object--is the first duty\r\nof revolutionists.\r\n\r\nBut, while circumspection and prudence are excellent qualities in\r\nevery great emergency, they become the allies of tyranny whenever they\r\nrestrain prompt, bold and decisive action against it.\r\n\r\nWe charge upon the present national compact, that it was formed at the\r\nexpense of human liberty, by a profligate surrender of principle, and\r\nto this hour is cemented with human blood.\r\n\r\nWe charge upon the American Constitution, that it contains provisions,\r\nand enjoins duties, which make it unlawful for freemen to take the\r\noath of allegiance to it, because they are expressly designed to favor\r\na slaveholding oligarchy, and consequently, to make one portion of the\r\npeople a prey to another.\r\n\r\nWe charge upon the existing national government, that it is an\r\ninsupportable despotism, wielded by a power which is superior to all\r\nlegal and constitutional restraints--equally indisposed and unable to\r\nprotect the lives or liberties of the people--the prop and safeguard\r\nof American slavery.\r\n\r\nThese charges we proceed briefly to establish:\r\n\r\nI. It is admitted by all men of intelligence,--or if it be denied in\r\nany quarter, the records of our national history settle the question\r\nbeyond doubt,--that the American Union was effected by a guilty\r\ncompromise between the free and slaveholding States; in other words,\r\nby immolating the colored population on the altar of slavery, by\r\ndepriving the North of equal rights and privileges, and by\r\nincorporating the slave system into the government. In the expressive\r\nand pertinent language of scripture, it was \"a covenant with death,\r\nand an agreement with hell\"--null and void before God, from the first\r\nhour of its inception--the framers of which were recreant to duty, and\r\nthe supporters of which are equally guilty.\r\n\r\nIt was pleaded at the time of the adoption, it is pleaded now, that,\r\nwithout such a compromise there could have been no union; that,\r\nwithout union, the colonies would have become an easy prey to the\r\nmother country; and, hence, that it was an act of necessity,\r\ndeplorable indeed when viewed alone, but absolutely indispensable to\r\nthe safety of the republic.\r\n\r\nTo this see reply: The plea is as profligate as the act was\r\ntyrannical. It is the jesuitical doctrine, that the end sanctifies the\r\nmeans. It is a confession of sin, but the denial of any guilt in its\r\nperpetration. It is at war with the government of God, and subversive\r\nof the foundations of morality. It is to make lies our refuge, and\r\nunder falsehood to hide ourselves, so that we may escape the\r\noverflowing scourge. \"Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, Judgment\r\nwill I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail\r\nshall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the\r\nhiding place.\" Moreover, \"because ye trust in oppression and\r\nperverseness, and stay thereon; therefore this iniquity shall be to\r\nyou as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose\r\nbreaking cometh suddenly at an instant. And he shall break it as the\r\nbreaking of the potter's vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not\r\nspare.\"\r\n\r\nThis plea is sufficiently broad to cover all the oppression and\r\nvillany that the sun has witnessed in his circuit, since God said,\r\n\"Let there be light.\" It assumes that to be practicable, which is\r\nimpossible, namely, that there can be freedom with slavery, union with\r\ninjustice, and safety with bloodguiltiness. A union of virtue with\r\npollution is the triumph of licentiousness. A partnership between\r\nright and wrong, is wholly wrong. A compromise of the principles of\r\nJustice, is the deification of crime.\r\n\r\nBetter that the American Union had never been formed, than that it\r\nshould have been obtained at such a frightful cost! If they were\r\nguilty who fashioned it, but who could not foresee all its frightful\r\nconsequences, how much more guilty are they, who, in full view of all\r\nthat has resulted from it, clamor for its perpetuity! If it was sinful\r\nat the commencement, to adopt it on the ground of escaping a greater\r\nevil, is it not equally sinful to swear to support it for the same\r\nreason, or until, in process of time, it be purged from its\r\ncorruption?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the compromise alluded to, instead of effecting a union,\r\nrendered it impracticable; unless by the term union are to understand\r\nthe absolute reign of the slaveholding power over the whole country,\r\nto the prostration of Northern rights. In the just use of words, the\r\nAmerican Union is and always has been a sham--an imposture. It is an\r\ninstrument of oppression unsurpassed in the criminal history of the\r\nworld. How then can it be innocently sustained? It is not certain, it\r\nis not even probable, that if it had not been adopted, the mother\r\ncountry would have reconquered the colonies. The spirit that would\r\nhave chosen danger in preference to crime,--to perish with justice\r\nrather than live with dishonor,--to dare and suffer whatever might\r\nbetide, rather than sacrifice the rights of one human being,--could\r\nnever have been subjugated by any mortal power. Surely it is paying a\r\npoor tribute to the valor and devotion of our revolutionary fathers in\r\nthe cause of liberty, to say that, if they had sternly refused to\r\nsacrifice their principles, they would have fallen an easy prey to the\r\ndespotic power of England.\r\n\r\nII. The American Constitution is the exponent of the national compact.\r\nWe affirm that it is an instrument which no man can innocently bind\r\nhimself to support, because its anti-republican and anti-christian\r\nrequirements are explicit and peremptory; at least, so explicit that,\r\nin regard to all the clauses pertaining to slavery, they have been\r\nuniformly understood and enforced in the same way, by all the courts\r\nand by all the people; and so peremptory, that no individual\r\ninterpretation or authority can set them aside with impunity. It is\r\nnot a ball of clay, to be moulded into any shape that party\r\ncontrivance or caprice may choose it to assume. It is not a form of\r\nwords, to be interpreted in any manner, or to any extent, or for the\r\naccomplishment of any purpose, that individuals in office under it may\r\ndetermine. _It means precisely what those who framed and adopted it\r\nmeant_--NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS, _as a matter of bargain and\r\ncompromise_. Even if it can be construed to mean something else,\r\nwithout violence to its language, such construction is not to be\r\ntolerated _against the wishes of either party_. No just or honest use\r\nof it can be made, in opposition to the plain intention of its\r\nframers, _except to declare the contract at an end, and to refuse to\r\nserve under it_.\r\n\r\nTo the argument, that the words \"slaves\" and \"slavery\" are not to be\r\nfound in the Constitution, and therefore that it was never intended to\r\ngive any protection or countenance to the slave system, it is\r\nsufficient to reply, that though no such words are contained in that\r\ninstrument, other words were used, intelligently and specifically, TO\r\nMEET THE NECESSITIES OF SLAVERY; and that these were adopted _in good\r\nfaith, to be observed until a constitutional change could be\r\neffected_. On this point, as to the design of certain provisions, no\r\nintelligent man can honestly entertain a doubt. If it be objected,\r\nthat though these provisions were meant to cover slavery, yet, as they\r\ncan fairly be interpreted to mean something exactly the reverse, it is\r\nallowable to give to them such an interpretation, _especially as the\r\ncause of freedom will thereby be promoted_--we reply, that this is to\r\nadvocate fraud and violence toward one of the contracting parties,\r\n_whose co-operation was secured only by an express agreement and\r\nunderstanding between them both, in regard to the clauses alluded to_;\r\nand that such a construction, if enforced by pains and penalties,\r\nwould unquestionably lead to a civil war, in which the aggrieved party\r\nwould justly claim to have been betrayed, and robbed of their\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\nAgain, if it be said, that those clauses, being immoral, are null and\r\nvoid--we reply, it is true they are not to be observed; but it is also\r\ntrue that they are portions of an instrument, the support of which, AS\r\nA WHOLE, is required by oath or affirmation; and, therefore, _because\r\nthey are immoral_, and BECAUSE OF THIS OBLIGATION TO ENFORCE\r\nIMMORALITY, no one can innocently swear to support the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAgain, if it be objected, that the Constitution was formed by the\r\npeople of the United States, in order to establish justice, to promote\r\nthe general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves\r\nand their posterity; and therefore, it is to be so construed as to\r\nharmonize with these objects; we reply, again, that its language is\r\n_not to be interpreted in a sense which neither of the contracting\r\nparties understood_, and which would frustrate every design of their\r\nalliance--to wit, _union at the expense of the colored population of\r\nthe country_. Moreover, nothing is more certain than that the preamble\r\nalluded to never included, in the minds of those who framed it, _those\r\nwho were then pining in bondage_--for, in that case, a general\r\nemancipation of the slaves would have instantly been proclaimed\r\nthroughout the United States. The words, \"secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to ourselves and our posterity,\" assuredly meant only the\r\nwhite population. \"To promote the general welfare,\" referred to their\r\nown welfare exclusively. \"To establish justice,\" was understood to be\r\nfor their sole benefit as slaveholders, and the guilty abettors of\r\nslavery. This is demonstrated by other parts of the same instrument,\r\nand by their own practice under it.\r\n\r\nWe would not detract aught from what is justly their due; but it is as\r\nreprehensible to give them credit for _what they did not possess_, as\r\nit is to rob them of what is theirs. It is absurd, it is false, it is\r\nan insult to the common sense of mankind, to pretend that the\r\nConstitution was intended to embrace the entire population of the\r\ncountry under its sheltering wings; or that the parties to it were\r\nactuated by a sense of justice and the spirit of impartial liberty; or\r\nthat it needs no alteration, but only a new interpretation, to make it\r\nharmonize with the object aimed at by its adoption. As truly might it\r\nbe argued, that because it is asserted in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, that all men are created equal and endowed with an\r\ninalienable right to liberty, therefore none of its signers were\r\nslaveholders, and since its adoption, slavery has been banished from\r\nthe American soil! The truth is, our fathers were intent on securing\r\nliberty _to themselves_, without being very scrupulous as to the means\r\nthey used to accomplish their purpose. They were not actuated by the\r\nspirit of universal philanthropy; and though in _words_ they\r\nrecognized occasionally the brotherhood of the human race, _in\r\npractice_ they continually denied it. They did not blush to enslave a\r\nportion of their fellow-men, and to buy and sell them as cattle in the\r\nmarket, while they were fighting against the oppression of the mother\r\ncountry, and boasting of their regard for the rights of man. Why,\r\nthen, concede to them virtues which they did not posses? _Why cling to\r\nthe falsehood, that they were no respecters of person in the formation\r\nof the government_?\r\n\r\nAlas! that they had no more fear of God, no more regard for man, in\r\ntheir hearts! \"The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah [The\r\nNorth and South] is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood,\r\nand the city full of perverseness; for they say, the Lord hath\r\nforsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.\"\r\n\r\nWe proceed to a critical examination of the American Constitution, in\r\nits relations to slavery.\r\n\r\nIn ARTICLE I, Section 9, it is declared--\"The migration or importation\r\nof such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper\r\nto admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress, prior to the year\r\none thousand eight hundred and eight; but a tax or duty may be imposed\r\non such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\"\r\n\r\nIn this Section, it will be perceived, the phraseology is so guarded\r\nas not to imply, _ex necessitate_, any criminal intent or inhuman\r\narrangement; and yet no one has ever had the hardihood or folly to\r\ndeny, that it was clearly understood by the contracting parties, to\r\nmean that there should be no interference with the African slave\r\ntrade, on the part of the general government, until the year 1808. For\r\ntwenty years after the adoption of the Constitution, the citizens of\r\nthe United States were to be encouraged and protected in the\r\nprosecution of that infernal traffic--in sacking and burning the\r\nhamlets of Africa--in slaughtering multitudes of the inoffensive\r\nnatives on the soil, kidnapping and enslaving a still greater\r\nproportion, crowding them to suffocation in the holds of the slave\r\nships, populating the Atlantic with their dead bodies, and subjecting\r\nthe wretched survivors to all the horrors of unmitigated bondage! This\r\nawful covenant was strictly fulfilled; and though, since its\r\ntermination, Congress has declared the foreign slave traffic to be\r\npiracy, yet all Christendom knows that the American flag, instead of\r\nbeing the terror of the African slavers, has given them the most ample\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the 9th Section was agreed to, by the national\r\nconvention that formed the constitution, is thus frankly avowed by the\r\nHon. Luther Martin,[8] who was a prominent member of that body:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Speech before the Legislature of Maryland in 1787.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Eastern States, notwithstanding their aversion of slavery, (!)\r\nwere _very willing to indulge the Southern States_ at least with a\r\ntemporary liberty to prosecute the slave trade, provided the Southern\r\nStates would, in their turn, _gratify_ them by laying no restriction\r\non navigation acts; and, after a very little time, the committee, by a\r\ngreat majority, agreed on a report, _by which the general government\r\nwas to be prohibited from preventing the importation of slaves_ for a\r\nlimited time; and the restrictive clause relative to navigation acts\r\nwas to be omitted.\"\r\n\r\nBehold the iniquity of this agreement! how sordid were the motives\r\nwhich led to it! what a profligate disregard of justice and humanity,\r\non the part of those who had solemnly declared the inalienable right\r\nof all men to be free and equal, to be a self-evident truth!\r\n\r\nIt is due to the national convention to say, that this section was not\r\nadopted \"without considerable opposition.\" Alluding to it, Mr. Martin\r\nobserves--\r\n\r\n\"It was said we had just assumed a place among the independent nations\r\nin consequence of our opposition to the attempts of Great Britain to\r\n_enslave us_; that this opposition was grounded upon the preservation\r\nof those rights to which God and nature has entitled us, not in\r\n_particular_, but in _common with all the rest of mankind_; that we\r\nhad appealed to the Supreme Being for his assistance, as the God of\r\nfreedom, who could not but approve our efforts to preserve the rights\r\nwhich he had thus imparted to his creatures; that now, when we had\r\nscarcely risen from our knees, from supplicating his mercy and\r\nprotection in forming our government over a free people, a government\r\nformed pretendedly on the principles of liberty, and for its\r\npreservation,--in that government to have a provision, not only of\r\nputting out of its power to restrain and prevent the slave trade, even\r\nencouraging that most infamous traffic, by giving the States the power\r\nand influence in the Union in proportion as they cruelly and wantonly\r\nsported with the rights of their fellow-creatures, ought to be\r\nconsidered as a solemn mockery of, and insult to, that God whose\r\nprotection we had thus implored, and could not fail to hold us up in\r\ndetestation, and render us contemptible to every true friend of\r\nliberty in the world. It was said that national crimes can only be,\r\nand frequently are, punished in this world by _national punishments_,\r\nand that the continuance of the slave trade, and thus giving it a\r\nnational character, sanction, and encouragement, ought to be\r\nconsidered as justly exposing us to the displeasure and vengeance of\r\nhim who is equally the Lord of all, and who views with equal eye the\r\npoor _African slave_ and his _American master!_ [9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: How terribly and justly as the guilty nation been\r\nscourged, since these words were spoken, on account of slavery and the\r\nslave trade!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was urged that, by this system, we were giving the general\r\ngovernment full and absolute power to regulate commerce, under which\r\ngeneral power it would have a right to restrain, or totally prohibit,\r\nthe slave trade: it must, therefore, appear to the world absurd and\r\ndisgraceful to the last degree that we should except from the exercise\r\nof that power the only branch of commerce which is unjustifiable in\r\nits nature, and contrary to the rights of mankind. That, on the\r\ncontrary, we ought to prohibit expressly, in our Constitution, the\r\nfurther importation of slaves, and to authorize the general\r\ngovernment, from time to time, to make such regulations as should be\r\nthought most advantageous for the gradual abolition of slavery, and\r\nthe emancipation of the slaves already in the States. That slavery is\r\ninconsistent with the genius of republicanism, and has a tendency to\r\ndestroy those principles on which it is supported, as it lessens the\r\nsense of the equal rights of mankind, and habituates to tyranny and\r\noppression. It was further urged that, by this system of government,\r\nevery State is to be protected both from foreign invasion and from\r\ndomestic insurrections; and, from this consideration, it was of the\r\nutmost importance it should have the power to restrain the importation\r\nof slaves, since in proportion as the number of slaves increased in\r\nany State, in the same proportion is the State weakened and exposed to\r\nforeign invasion and domestic insurrection; and by so much less will\r\nit be able to protect itself against either, and therefore by so much,\r\nwant aid and be a burden to, the Union.\r\n\r\n\"It was further said, that, in this system, as we were giving the\r\ngeneral government power, under the idea of national character, or\r\nnational interest, to regulate even our weights and measures, and have\r\nprohibited all possibility of emitting paper money, and passing\r\ninsolvent laws, &c., it must appear still more extraordinary that we\r\nprohibited the government from interfering with the slave trade, than\r\nwhich nothing could more effect our national honor and interest.\r\n\r\n\"These reasons influenced me, both in the committee and in the\r\nconvention, most decidedly to oppose and vote against the clause, as\r\nit now makes part of the system.\" [10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Secret Proceedings, p. 61.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy had it been for this nation, had these solemn considerations\r\nbeen heeded by the framers of the Constitution! But for the sake of\r\nsecuring some local advantages, they choose to do evil that good may\r\ncome, and to make the end sanctify the means. They were willing to\r\nenslave others, that they might secure their own freedom. They did\r\nthis deed deliberately, with their eyes open, with all the facts and\r\nconsequences arising therefrom before them, in violation of all their\r\nheaven-attested declarations, and in atheistical distrust of the\r\noverruling power of God. \"The Eastern States were very willing to\r\n_indulge_ the Southern States\" in the unrestricted prosecution of\r\ntheir piratical traffic, provided in return they could be _gratified_\r\nby no restriction on being laid on navigation acts!!--Had there been\r\nno other provision of the Constitution justly liable to objection,\r\nthis one alone rendered the support of that instrument incompatible\r\nwith the duties which men owe to their Creator, and to each other. It\r\nwas the poisonous infusion in the cup, which, though constituting but\r\na very slight portion of its contents, perilled the life of every one\r\nwho partook of it.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked to what purpose are these animadversions, since the\r\nclause alluded to has long since expired by its own limitation--we\r\nanswer, that, if at any time the foreign slave trade could be\r\n_constitutionally_ prosecuted, it may yet be renewed, under the\r\nConstitution, at the pleasure of Congress, whose prohibitory statute\r\nis liable to be reversed at any moment, in the frenzy of Southern\r\nopposition to emancipation. It is ignorantly supposed that the bargain\r\nwas, that the traffic _should cease_ in 1808; but the only thing\r\nsecured by it was, the _right_ of Congress (not any obligation) to\r\nprohibit it at that period. If, therefore, Congress had not chosen to\r\nexercise that right, _the traffic might have been prolonged\r\nindefinitely, under the Constitution_. The right to destroy any\r\nparticular branch of commerce, implies the right to re-establish it.\r\nTrue, there is no probability that the African slave trade will ever\r\nagain be legalized by the national government; but no credit is due\r\nthe framers of the Constitution on this ground; for, while they threw\r\naround it all the sanction and protection of the national character\r\nand power for twenty years, _they set no bounds to its continuance by\r\nany positive constitutional prohibition_.\r\n\r\nAgain, the adoption of such a clause, and the faithful execution of\r\nit, prove what was meant by the words of the preamble--\"to form a more\r\nperfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,\r\nprovide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and\r\nsecure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity\"--namely, that the parties to the Constitution regarded\r\nonly their own rights and interests, and never intended that its\r\nlanguage should be so interpreted as to interfere with slavery, or to\r\nmake it unlawful for one portion of the people to enslave another,\r\n_without an express alteration in the instrument, in the manner\r\ntherein set forth_. While, therefore, the Constitution remains as it\r\nwas originally adopted, they who swear to support it are bound to\r\ncomply with all its provisions, as a matter of allegiance. For it\r\navails nothing to say, that some of those provisions are at war with\r\nthe law of God and the rights of man, and therefore are not\r\nobligatory. Whatever may be their character, they are\r\n_constitutionally_, obligatory; and whoever feels that he cannot\r\nexecute them, or swear to execute them, without committing sin,\r\nhas no other choice left than to withdraw from the government, or to\r\nviolate his conscience by taking on his lips an impious promise. The\r\nobject of the Constitution is not to define _what is the law of God_,\r\nbut WHAT IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE--which will is not to be frustrated\r\nby an ingenious moral interpretation, by those whom they have elected\r\nto serve them.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1, Sect. 2, provides--\"Representatives and direct taxes shall\r\nbe apportioned among the several States, which may be included within\r\nthis Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be\r\ndetermined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including\r\nthose bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not\r\ntaxed, _three-fifths of all other persons_.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as in the clause we have already examined, veiled beneath a form\r\nof words as deceitful as it is unmeaning in a truly democratic\r\ngovernment, is a provision for the safety, perpetuity and augmentation\r\nof the slaveholding power--a provision scarcely less atrocious than\r\nthat which related to the African slave trade, and almost as\r\nafflictive in its operation--a provision still in force, with no\r\npossibility of its alteration, so long as a majority of the slave\r\nStates choose to maintain their slave system--a provision which, at\r\nthe present time, enables the South to have twenty-five additional\r\nrepresentatives in Congress on the score of _property_, while the\r\nNorth is not allowed to have one--a provision which concedes to the\r\noppressed three-fifths of the political power which is granted to all\r\nothers, and then puts this power into the hands of their oppressors,\r\nto be wielded by them for the more perfect security of their tyrannous\r\nauthority, and the complete subjugation of the non-slaveholding\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nReferring to this atrocious bargain, ALEXANDER HAMILTON remarked in\r\nthe New York Convention--\r\n\r\n\"The first thing objected to, is that clause which allows a\r\nrepresentation for three-fifths of the negroes. Much has been said of\r\nthe impropriety of representing men who have no will of their own:\r\nwhether this is _reasoning_, or _declamation_, (!!) I will not presume\r\nto say. It is the _unfortunate_ situation of the Southern States to\r\nhave a great part of their population, as well as _property_, in\r\nblacks. The regulation complained of was one result of _the spirit of\r\naccommodation_ which governed the Convention: and without this\r\n_indulgence_, NO UNION COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN FORMED. But, sir,\r\nconsidering some _peculiar advantages_ which we derive from them, it\r\nis entirely JUST that they should be _gratified_.--The Southern States\r\npossess certain staples, tobacco, rice, indigo, &c.--which must be\r\n_capital_ objects in treaties of commerce with foreign nations; and\r\nthe advantage which they necessarily procure in these treaties will be\r\nfelt throughout the United states.\"\r\n\r\nIf such was the patriotism, such the love of liberty, such the\r\nmorality of ALEXANDER HAMILTON, what can be said of the character of\r\nthose who were far less conspicuous than himself in securing American\r\nindependence, and in framing the American Constitution?\r\n\r\nListen, now, to the questions of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, respecting the\r\nconstitutional clause now under consideration:--\r\n\r\n\"'In outward show, it is a representation of persons in bondage; in\r\nfact, it is a representation of their masters,--the oppressor\r\nrepresenting the oppressed.'--'Is it in the compass of human\r\nimagination to devise a more perfect exemplification of the art of\r\ncommitting the lamb to the tender custody of the wolf?'--'The\r\nrepresentative is thus constituted, not the friend, agent and trustee\r\nof the person whom he represents, but the most inveterate of his\r\nfoes.'--'It was _one_ of the curses from that Pandora's box, adjusted\r\nat the time, as usual, by a _compromise_, the whole advantage of which\r\ninured to the benefit of the South, and to aggravate the burdens of\r\nthe North.'--'If there be a parallel to it in human history, it can\r\nonly be that of the Roman Emperors, who, from the days when Julius\r\nCaesar substituted a military despotism in the place of a republic,\r\namong the offices which they always concentrated upon themselves, was\r\nthat of tribune of the people. A Roman Emperor tribune of the people,\r\nis an exact parallel to that feature in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates which makes the master the representative of his slave.'--'The\r\nConstitution of the United States expressly prescribes that no title\r\nof nobility shall be granted by the United States. The spirit of this\r\ninterdict is not a rooted antipathy to the grant of mere powerless\r\nempty _titles_, but to titles of _nobility_; to the institution of\r\nprivileged orders of men. But what order of men under the most\r\nabsolute of monarchies, or the most aristocratic of republics, was\r\never invested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that of the\r\nseparate and exclusive representation of less than half a million\r\nowners of slaves, in the Hall of this House, in the Chair of the\r\nSenate, and in the Presidential mansion?'--'This investment of power\r\nin the owners of one species of property concentrated in the highest\r\nauthorities of the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\r\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged order of men\r\nin the community, more adverse to the rights of all, and more\r\npernicious to the interests of the whole, than any order of nobility\r\never known. To call government thus constituted a democracy, is to\r\ninsult the understanding of mankind. To call it an aristocracy, is to\r\ndo injustice to that form of government. Aristocracy is the government\r\nof _the best_. Its standard qualification for accession to power _is\r\nmerit_, ascertained by popular election recurring at short intervals\r\nof time. If even that government is prone to degenerate into tyranny,\r\nwhat must be the character of that form of polity in which the\r\nstandard qualification for access to power is wealth in the possession\r\nof slaves? It is doubly tainted with the infection of riches and of\r\nslavery. _There is no name in the language of national jurisprudence\r\nthat can define it_--no model in the records of ancient history, or in\r\nthe political theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\r\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States by an\r\nequivocation--a representation of property under the name of persons.\r\nLittle did the members of the Convention from the free States foresee\r\nwhat a sacrifice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this\r\nconcession.'--'The House of Representatives of the United States\r\nconsists of 223 members--all, by _the letter_ of the Constitution,\r\nrepresentatives only of _persons_, as 135 of them really are; but the\r\nother 88, equally representing the _persons_ of their constituents, by\r\nwhom they are elected, also represent, under the name of _other\r\npersons_, upwards of two and a half millions of _slaves_, held as the\r\n_property_ of less than half a million of the white constituents, and\r\nvalued at twelve hundred millions of dollars. Each of these 88 members\r\nrepresents in fact the whole of that mass of associated wealth, and\r\nthe persons and exclusive interests of its owners; all thus knit\r\ntogether, like the members of a moneyed corporation, with a capital\r\nnot of thirty-five or forty or fifty, but of twelve hundred millions\r\nof dollars, exhibiting the most extraordinary exemplification of the\r\nanti-republican tendencies of associated wealth that the world ever\r\nsaw.'--'Here is one class of men, consisting of not more than one\r\nfortieth part of the whole people, not more than one-thirtieth part of\r\nthe free population, exclusively devoted to their personal interests\r\nidentified with their own as slaveholders of the same associated\r\nwealth, and wielding by their votes, upon every question of government\r\nor of public policy, two-fifths of the whole power of the House. In\r\nthe Senate of the Union, the proportion of the slaveholding power is\r\nyet greater. By the influence of slavery, in the States where the\r\ninstitution is tolerated, over their elections, no other than a\r\nslaveholder can rise to the distinction of obtaining a seat in the\r\nSenate; and thus, of the 52 members of the federal Senate, 26 are\r\nowners of slaves, and as effectively representatives of that interest\r\nas the 88 members elected by them to the House.'--'By this process it\r\nis that all political power in the States is absorbed and engrossed by\r\nthe owners of _slaves_, and the overruling policy of the States is\r\nshaped to strengthen and consolidate their domination. The\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial authorities are all in their\r\nhands--the preservation, propagation, and perpetuation of the black\r\ncode of slavery--every law of the legislature becomes a link in the\r\nchain of the slave; every executive act a rivet to his hapless fate;\r\nevery judicial decision a perversion of the human intellect to the\r\njustification of _wrong._'--'Its reciprocal operation upon the\r\ngovernment of the nation is, to establish an artificial majority in\r\nthe slave representation over that of the free people, in the American\r\nCongress, and thereby to make the PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION, AND\r\nPERPETUATION OF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRIT OF THE NATIONAL\r\nGOVERNMENT.'--'The result is seen in the fact that, at this day, the\r\nPresident of the United States, the President of the Senate, the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, and five out of nine of the\r\nJudges of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the United States, are not\r\nonly citizens of slaveholding States, but individual slaveholders\r\nthemselves. So are, and constantly have been, with scarcely an\r\nexception, all the members of both Houses of Congress from the\r\nslaveholding States; and so are, in immensely disproportionate\r\nnumbers, the commanding officers of the army and navy; the officers of\r\nthe customs; the registers and receivers of the land offices, and the\r\npost-masters throughout the slaveholding States.--The Biennial\r\nRegister indicates the birth-place of all the officers employed in the\r\ngovernment of the Union. If it were required to designate the owners\r\nof this species of property among them, it would be little more than a\r\ncatalogue of slaveholders.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is confessed by Mr. Adams, alluding to the national convention that\r\nframed the Constitution, that \"the delegation from the free States, in\r\ntheir extreme anxiety to conciliate the ascendency of the Southern\r\nslaveholder, did listen to _a compromise between right and\r\nwrong--between freedom and slavery_; of the ultimate fruits of which\r\nthey had no conception, but which already even now is urging the Union\r\nto its inevitable ruin and dissolution, by a civil, servile, foreign,\r\nand Indian war, all combined in one; a war, the essential issue of\r\nwhich will be between freedom and slavery, and in which the unhallowed\r\nstandard of slavery will be the desecrated banner of the North\r\nAmerican Union--that banner, first unfurled to the breeze, inscribed\r\nwith the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence.\"\r\n\r\nHence to swear to support the Constitution of the United States, _as\r\nit is_, is to make \"a compromise between right and wrong,\" and to wage\r\nwar against human liberty. It is to recognize and honor as republican\r\nlegislators, _incorrigible men-stealers_, MERCILESS TYRANTS, BLOOD\r\nTHIRSTY ASSASSINS, who legislate with deadly weapons about their\r\npersons, such as pistols, daggers, and bowie-knives, with which they\r\nthreaten to murder any Northern senator or representative who shall\r\ndare to stain their _honor_, or interfere with their _rights_! They\r\nconstitute a banditti more fierce and cruel than any whose atrocities\r\nare recorded on the pages of history or romance. To mix with them on\r\nterms of social or religious fellowship, is to indicate a low state of\r\nvirtue; but to think of administering a free government by their\r\nco-operation, is nothing short of insanity.\r\n\r\nArticle IV., Section 2, declares,--\"no person held to service or labor\r\non one State, _under the laws thereof_, escaping into another, shall,\r\nin consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from\r\nsuch service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party\r\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a third clause, which, like the other two, makes no mention of\r\nslavery or slaves, in express terms; and yet, like them, was\r\nintelligently framed and mutually understood by the parties to the\r\nratification, and intended both to protect the slave system and to\r\nrestore runaway slaves. It alone makes slavery a national institution,\r\na national crime, and all the people who are not enslaved, the\r\nbody-guard over those whose liberties have been cloven down. This\r\nagreement, too, has been fulfilled to the letter by the North.\r\n\r\nUnder the Mosaic dispensation it was imperatively commanded,--\"Thou\r\nshalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from\r\nhis master unto thee: he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in\r\nthat place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh\r\nhim best: thou shalt not oppress him.\" The warning which the prophet\r\nIsaiah gave to oppressing Moab was of a similar kind: \"Take counsel,\r\nexecute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the\r\nnoon-day; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. Let mine\r\noutcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face\r\nof the spoiler.\" The prophet Obadiah brings the following charge\r\nagainst treacherous Edom, which is precisely applicable to this guilty\r\nnation:--\"For thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall come\r\nover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. In the day that thou\r\nstoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away\r\ncaptive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast\r\nlots upon Jerusalem, _even thou wast as one of them_. But thou\r\nshouldst not have looked on the day of thy brother, in the day that he\r\nbecame a stranger; neither shouldst thou have rejoiced over the\r\nchildren of Judah, in the day of their destruction; neither shouldst\r\nthou have spoken proudly in the day of distress; neither shouldst thou\r\nhave _stood in the cross-way, to cut off those of his that did\r\nescape_; neither shouldst thou have _delivered up those of his that\r\ndid remain_, in the day of distress.\"\r\n\r\nHow exactly descriptive of this boasted republic is the impeachment of\r\nEdom by the same prophet! \"The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee,\r\nthou whose habitation is high; that saith in thy heart, Who shall\r\nbring me down to the ground? Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle,\r\nand though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee\r\ndown, saith the Lord.\" The emblem of American pride and power is the\r\n_eagle_, and on her banner she has mingled _stars_ with its _stripes_.\r\nHer vanity, her treachery, her oppression, her self-exaltation, and\r\nher defiance of the Almighty, far surpass the madness and wickedness\r\nof Edom. What shall be her punishment? Truly, it may be affirmed of\r\nthe American people, (who live not under the Levitical but Christian\r\ncode, and whose guilt, therefore, is the more awful, and their\r\ncondemnation the greater,) in the language of another prophet--\"They\r\nall lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.\r\nThat they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh,\r\nand the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his\r\nmischievous desire: _so they wrap it up_.\" Likewise of the colored\r\ninhabitants of this land it may be said,--\"This is a people robbed and\r\nspoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in\r\nprison-houses; they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil,\r\nand none saith, Restore.\"\r\n\r\nBy this stipulation, the Northern States are made the hunting ground\r\nof slave-catchers, who may pursue their victims with bloodhounds, and\r\ncapture them with impunity wherever they can lay their robber hands\r\nupon them. At least twelve or fifteen thousand runaway slaves are now\r\nin Canada, exiled from their native land, because they could not find,\r\nthroughout its vast extent, a single road on which they could dwell in\r\nsafety, in _consequence of this provision of the Constitution_? How is\r\nit possible, then, for the advocates of liberty to support a\r\ngovernment which gives over to destruction one-sixth part of the whole\r\npopulation?\r\n\r\nIt is denied by some at the present day, that the clause which has\r\nbeen cited, was intended to apply to runaway slaves. This indicates\r\neither ignorance, or folly or something worse. JAMES MADISON, as one\r\nof the framers of the Constitution, is of some authority on this\r\npoint. Alluding to that instrument, in the Virginia convention, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Another clause _secures us that property which we now possess_. At\r\npresent, if any slave elopes to those States where slaves are free,\r\n_he becomes emancipated by their laws_; for the laws of the States are\r\n_uncharitable_ (!) to one another in this respect; but in this\r\nconstitution, 'No person held to service or labor in one State, under\r\nthe laws thereof, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation\r\ntherein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be\r\ndelivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may\r\nbe due.' THIS CLAUSE WAS EXPRESSLY INSERTED TO ENABLE THE OWNERS OF\r\nSLAVES TO RECLAIM THEM. _This is a better security than any that now\r\nexists_. No power is given to the general government to interfere with\r\nrespect to the property in slaves now held by the States.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same convention, alluding to the same clause, GOV. RANDOLPH\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Every one knows that slaves are held to service or labor. And, when\r\nauthority is given to owners of slaves _to vindicate their property_,\r\ncan it be supposed they can be deprived of it? If a citizen of this\r\nState, in consequence of this clause, can take his runaway slave in\r\nMaryland, can it be seriously thought that, after taking him and\r\nbringing him home, he could be made free?\"\r\n\r\nIt is objected, that slaves are held as property, and therefore, as\r\nthe clause refers to persons, it cannot mean slaves. But this is\r\ncriticism against fact. Slaves are recognized not merely as property,\r\nbut also as persons--as having a mixed character--as combining the\r\nhuman with the brutal. This is paradoxical, we admit; but slavery is a\r\nparadox--the American Constitution is a paradox--the American Union is\r\na paradox--the American Government is a paradox; and if any one of\r\nthese is to be repudiated on that ground, they all are. That it is the\r\nduty of the friends of freedom to deny the binding authority of them\r\nall, and to secede from them all, we distinctly affirm. After the\r\nindependence of this country had been achieved, the voice of God\r\nexhorted the people, saying, \"Execute true judgment, and show mercy\r\nand compassion, every man to his brother: and oppress not the widow,\r\nnor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you\r\nimagine evil against his brother in your heart. But they refused to\r\nhearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that\r\nthey should not hear; yea, they made their hearts as an adamant\r\nstone.\" \"Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord. Shall not\r\nmy soul be avenged on such a notion as this?\"\r\n\r\nWhatever doubt may have rested on any honest mind, respecting the\r\nmeaning of the clause in relation to persons held to service or labor,\r\nmust have been removed by the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, in the case of Prigg versus The State of\r\nPennsylvania. By that decision, any Southern slave-catcher is\r\nempowered to seize and convey to the South, without hindrance or\r\nmolestation on the part of the State, and without any legal process\r\nduly obtained and served, any person or persons, irrespective of caste\r\nor complexion, whom he may choose to claim as runaway slaves; and if,\r\nwhen thus surprised and attacked, or on their arrival South, they\r\ncannot prove by legal witnesses, that they are freemen, their doom is\r\nsealed! Hence the free colored population of the North are specially\r\nliable to become the victims of this terrible power, and all the other\r\ninhabitants are at the mercy of prowling kidnappers, because there are\r\nmultitudes of white as well as black slaves on Southern plantations,\r\nand slavery is no longer fastidious with regard to the color of its\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nAs soon as that appalling decision of the Supreme Court was\r\nenunciated, in the name of the Constitution, the people of the North\r\nshould have risen _en masse_, if for no other cause, and declared the\r\nUnion at an end; and they would have done so, if they had not lost\r\ntheir manhood, and their reverence for justice and liberty.\r\n\r\nIn the 4th Sect. of Art. IV., the United States guarantee to protect\r\nevery State in the Union \"against _domestic violence_.\" By the 8th\r\nSection of Article I., congress is empowered \"to provide for calling\r\nforth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, _suppress\r\ninsurrections_, and repel invasions.\" These provisions, however\r\nstrictly they may apply to cases of disturbance among the white\r\npopulation, were adopted with special reference to the slave\r\npopulation, for the purpose of keeping them in their chains by the\r\ncombined military force of the country; and were these repealed, and\r\nthe South left to manage her slaves as best she could, a servile\r\ninsurrection would ere long be the consequence, as general as it would\r\nunquestionably be successful. Says Mr. Madison, respecting these\r\nclauses:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On application of the legislature or executive, as the case may be,\r\nthe militia of the other States are to be called to suppress domestic\r\ninsurrections. Does this bar the States from calling forth their own\r\nmilitia? No; but it gives them a _supplementary_ security to suppress\r\ninsurrections and domestic violence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer to Patrick Henry's objection, as urged against the\r\nconstitution in the Virginia convention, that there was no power left\r\nto the _States_ to quell an insurrection of slaves, as it was wholly\r\nvested in congress, George Nicholas asked:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have they it now?  If they have, does the constitution take it away?\r\nIf it does, it must be in one of those clauses which have been\r\nmentioned by the worthy member. The first part gives the general\r\ngovernment power to call them out when necessary. Does this take it\r\naway from the States? No! but _it gives an additional security;_ for,\r\nbeside the power in the State government to use their own militia, it\r\nwill be _the duty of the general government_ to aid them WITH THE\r\nSTRENGTH OF THE UNION, when called for.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis solemn guaranty of security to the slave system, caps the climax\r\nof national barbarity, and stains with human blood the garments of all\r\nthe people. In consequence of it, that system has multiplied its\r\nvictims from five hundred thousand to nearly three millions--a vast\r\namount of territory has been purchased, in order to give it extension\r\nand perpetuity--several new slave States have been admitted into the\r\nUnion--the slave trade has been made one of the great branches of\r\nAmerican commerce--the slave population, though over-worked, starved,\r\nlacerated, branded, maimed, and subjected to every form of deprivation\r\nand every species of torture, have been overawed and crushed,--or,\r\nwhenever they have attempted to gain their liberty by revolt, they\r\nhave been shot down and quelled by the strong arm of the national\r\ngovernment; as, for example, in the case of Nat Turner's insurrection\r\nin Virginia, when the naval and military forces of the government were\r\ncalled into active service. Cuban bloodhounds have been purchased with\r\nthe money of the people, and imported and used to hunt slave fugitives\r\namong the everglades of Florida. A merciless warfare has been waged\r\nfor the extermination or expulsion of the Florida Indians, because\r\nthey gave succor to those poor hunted fugitives--a warfare which has\r\ncost the nation several thousand lives, and forty millions of dollars.\r\nBut the catalogue of enormities is too long to be recapitulated in the\r\npresent address.\r\n\r\nWe have thus demonstrated that the compact between the North and the\r\nSouth embraces every variety of wrong and outrage,--is at war with God\r\nand man, cannot be innocently supported, and deserves to be\r\nimmediately annulled. In behalf of the Society which we represent, we\r\ncall upon all our fellow-citizens, who believe it is right to obey God\r\nrather than man, to declare themselves peaceful revolutionists, and to\r\nunite with us under the stainless banner of Liberty, having for its\r\nmotto--\"EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL--NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleaded that the Constitution provides for its own amendment;\r\nand we ought to use the elective franchise to effect this object.\r\nTrue, there is such a proviso; but, until the amendment be made, that\r\ninstrument is binding as it stands. Is it not to violate every moral\r\ninstinct, and to sacrifice principle to expediency, to argue that we\r\nmay swear to steal, oppress and murder by wholesale, because it may be\r\nnecessary to do so only for the time being, and because there is some\r\nremote probability that the instrument which requires that we should\r\nbe robbers, oppressors and murderers, may at some future day be\r\namended in these particulars? Let us not palter with our consciences\r\nin this manner--let us not deny that the compact was conceived in sin\r\nand brought forth in iniquity--let us not be so dishonest, even to\r\npromote a good object, as to interpret the Constitution in a manner\r\nutterly at variance with the intentions and arrangements of the\r\ncontracting parties; but, confessing the guilt of the nation,\r\nacknowledging the dreadful specifications in the bond, washing our\r\nhands in the waters of repentance from all further participation in\r\nthis criminal alliance, and resolving that we will sustain none other\r\nthan a free and righteous government, let us glory in the name of\r\nrevolutionists, unfurl the banner of disunion, and consecrate our\r\ntalents and means to the overthrow of all that is tyrannical in the\r\nland,--to the establishment of all that is free, just, true and\r\nholy,--to the triumph of universal love and peace.\r\n\r\nIf, in utter disregard of the historical facts which have been cited,\r\nit is still asserted, that the Constitution needs no amendment to make\r\nit a free instrument, adapted to all the exigencies of a free people,\r\nand was never intended to give any strength or countenance to the\r\nslave system--the indignant spirit of insulted Liberty replies:--\"What\r\nthough the assertion be true? Of what avail is a mere piece of\r\nparchment? In itself, though it be written all over with words of\r\ntruth and freedom--though its provisions be as impartial and just as\r\nwords can express, or the imagination paint--though it be as pure as\r\nthe gospel, and breathe only the spirit of Heaven--it is powerless; it\r\nhas no executive vitality; it is a lifeless corpse, even though\r\nbeautiful in death. I am famishing for lack of bread! How is my\r\nappetite relieved by holding up to my gaze a painted loaf? I am\r\nmanacled, wounded, bleeding, dying! What consolation is it to know,\r\nthat they who are seeking to destroy my life, profess in words to be\r\nmy friends?\" If the liberties of the people have been betrayed--if\r\njudgement is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off, and\r\ntruth has fallen in the streets, and equality cannot enter--if the\r\nprinces of the land are roaring lions, the judges evening wolves, the\r\npeople light and treacherous persons, the priests covered with\r\npollution--if we are living under a frightened despotism, which scoffs\r\nat all constitutional restrains, and wields the resources of the\r\nnation to promote its own bloody purposes--tell us not that the forms\r\nof freedom are still left to us! \"Would such tameness and submission\r\nhave freighted the May-Flower for Plymouth Rock? Would it have\r\nresisted the Stamp Act, the Tea Tax, or any of those entering wedges\r\nof tyranny with which the British government sought to rive the\r\nliberties of America? The wheel of the Revolution would have rusted on\r\nits axle, if a spirit so weak had been the only power to give it\r\nmotion. Did our fathers say, when their rights and liberties were\r\ninfringed--\"_Why, what is done cannot be undone_. That is the first\r\nthought.\" No it was the last thing they thought of: or, rather it\r\nnever entered their minds at all. They sprang to the conclusion at\r\nonce--\"_What is done_ SHALL _be undone_. That is our FIRST and ONLY\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Is water running in our veins? Do we remember still\r\n    Old Plymouth Rock, and Lexington, and famous Bunker Hill?\r\n    The debt we owe our fathers' graves? and to the yet unborn,\r\n    Whose heritage ourselves must make a thing of pride or scorn?\r\n\r\n    Gray Plymouth Rock hath yet a tongue, and Concord is not dumb;\r\n    And voices from our fathers' graves and from the future come:\r\n    They call on us to stand our ground--they charge us still to be\r\n    Not only free from chains ourselves, but foremost to make free!\"\r\n\r\nIt is of little consequence who is on the throne, if there be behind\r\nit a power mightier than the throne. It matters not what is the theory\r\nof the government, if the practice of the government be unjust and\r\ntyrannical. We rise in rebellion against a despotism incomparably more\r\ndreadful than that which induced the colonists to take up arms against\r\nthe mother country; not on account of a three-penny tax on tea, but\r\nbecause fetters of living iron are fastened on the limbs of millions\r\nof our countrymen, and our own sacred rights are trampled in the dust.\r\nAs citizens of the State, we appeal to the State in vain for\r\nprotection and redress. As citizen of the United States, we are\r\ntreated as outlaws in one half of the country, and the national\r\ngovernment consents to our destruction. We are denied the right of\r\nlocomotion, freedom of speech, the right of petition, the liberty of\r\nthe press, the right peaceably to assemble together to protest against\r\noppression and plead for liberty--at least in thirteen States of the\r\nUnion. If we venture, as avowed and unflinching abolitionists, to\r\ntravel South of Mason and Dixon's line, we do so at the peril of our\r\nlives. If we would escape torture and death, on visiting any of the\r\nslave States, we must stifle our conscientious convictions, hear no\r\ntestimony against cruelty and tyranny, suppress the struggling\r\nemotions of humanity, divest ourselves of all letters and papers of an\r\nantislavery character, and do homage to the slaveholding power--or run\r\nthe risk of a cruel martyrdom! These are appalling and undeniable\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThree millions of the American people are crushed under the American\r\nUnion! They are held as slaves--trafficked as merchandise--registered\r\nas goods and chattels! The government gives them no protection--the\r\ngovernment is their enemy--the government keeps them in chains! There\r\nthey lie bleeding--we are prostrate by their side--in their sorrows\r\nand sufferings we participate--their stripes are inflicted on our\r\nbodies, their shackles are fastened to our limbs, their cause is ours!\r\nThe Union which grinds them to the dust rests upon us, and with them\r\nwe will struggle to overthrow it! The Constitution, which subjects\r\nthem to hopeless bondage, is one that we cannot swear to support! Our\r\nmotto is, \"NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS,\" either religious or political.\r\nThey are the fiercest enemies of mankind, and the bitterest foes of\r\nGod! We separate from them not in anger, not in malice, not for a\r\nselfish purpose, not to do them an injury, not to cease warning,\r\nexhorting, reproving them for their crimes, not to leave the perishing\r\nbondman to his fate--O no! But to clear our skirts of innocent\r\nblood--to give the oppressor no countenance--to signify our abhorrence\r\nof injustice and cruelty--to testify against an ungodly compact--to\r\ncease striking hands with thieves and consenting with adulterers--to\r\nmake no compromise with tyranny--to walk worthily of our high\r\nprofession--to increase our moral power over the nation--to obey God\r\nand vindicate the gospel of His Son--to hasten the downfall of slavery\r\nin America, and throughout the world!\r\n\r\nWe are not acting under a blind impulse. We have carefully counted the\r\ncost of this warfare, and are prepared to meet its consequences. It\r\nwill subject us to reproach, persecution, infamy--it will prove a\r\nfiery ordeal to all who shall pass through it--it may cost us our\r\nlives. We shall be ridiculed as fools, scorned as visionaries, branded\r\nas disorganizers, reviled as madmen, threatened and perhaps punished\r\nas traitors. But we shall bide our time. Whether safety or peril,\r\nwhether victory or defeat, whether life or death be ours, believing\r\nthat our feet are planted on an eternal foundation, that our position\r\nis sublime and glorious, that our faith in God is rational and\r\nsteadfast, that we have exceeding great and precious promises on which\r\nto rely, THAT WE ARE IN THE RIGHT, we shall not falter nor be\r\ndismayed, \"though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be\r\ncarried into the midst of the sea,\"--though our ranks be thinned to\r\nthe number of \"three hundred men.\" Freemen! are you ready for the\r\nconflict? Come what may, will you sever the chain that binds you to a\r\nslaveholding government, and declare your independence? Up, then, with\r\nthe banner of revolution! Not to shed blood--not to injure the person\r\nor estate of any oppressor--not by force and arms to resist any\r\nlaw--not to countenance a servile insurrection--not to wield any\r\ncarnal weapons! No--ours must be a bloodless strife, excepting _our_\r\nblood be shed--for we aim, as did Christ our leader, not to destroy\r\nmen's lives, but to save them--to overcome evil with good--to conquer\r\nthrough suffering for righteousness' sake--to set the captive free by\r\nthe potency of truth!\r\n\r\nSecede, then, from the government. Submit to its exactions, but pay it\r\nno allegiance, and give it no voluntary aid. Fill no offices under it.\r\nSend no senators or representatives to the national or State\r\nlegislature; for what you cannot conscientiously perform yourself, you\r\ncannot ask another to perform as your agent. Circulate a declaration\r\nof DISUNION FROM SLAVEHOLDERS, throughout the country. Hold mass\r\nmeetings--assemble in conventions--nail your banners to the mast!\r\n\r\nDo you ask what can be done, if you abandon the ballot-box? What did\r\nthe crucified Nazarene do without the elective franchise? What did the\r\napostles do? What did the glorious army of martyrs and confessors do?\r\nWhat did Luther and his intrepid associates do? What can women and\r\nchildren do? What has Father Mathew done for teetotalism? What has\r\nDaniel O'Connell done for Irish repeal? \"Stand, having your loins girt\r\nabout with truth, and having on the breast-plate of righteousness,\" and\r\narrayed in the whole armor of God!\r\n\r\nThe form of government that shall succeed the present government of\r\nthe United States, let time determine. It would be a waste of time to\r\nargue that question, until the people are regenerated and turned from\r\ntheir iniquity. Ours is no anarchical movement, but one of order and\r\nobedience. In ceasing from oppression, we establish liberty. What is\r\nnow fragmentary, shall in due time be crystallized, and shine like a\r\ngem set in the heavens, for a light to all coming ages.\r\n\r\nFinally--we believe that the effect of this movement will be,--First,\r\nto create discussion and agitation throughout the North; and these\r\nwill lead to a general perception of its grandeur and importance.\r\n\r\nSecondly, to convulse the slumbering South like an earthquake, and\r\nconvince her that her only alternative is, to abolish slavery, or be\r\nabandoned by that power on which she now relies for safety.\r\n\r\nThirdly, to attack the slave power in its most vulnerable point, and\r\nto carry the battle to the gate.\r\n\r\nFourthly, to exalt the moral sense, increase the moral power, and\r\ninvigorate the moral constitution of all who heartily espouse it.\r\n\r\nWe reverently believe that, in withdrawing from the American Union, we\r\nhave the God of justice with us. We know that we have our enslaved\r\ncountrymen with us. We are confident that all free hearts will be with\r\nus. We are certain that tyrants and their abettors will be against us.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of the Executive committee of the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety,\r\n\r\nWM. LLOYD GARRISON, _President_.\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS, MARIA WESTON CHAPMAN   }  _Secretaries_.\r\n_Boston, May 20, 1844_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM FRANCIS JACKSON.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, 4th July, 1844.\r\n\r\n_To His Excellency George N. Briggs_:\r\n\r\nSIR--Many years since, I received from the executive of the\r\nCommonwealth a commission as Justice of the Peace. I have held the\r\noffice that it conferred upon me till the present time, and have found\r\nit a convenience to myself, and others. It might continue to be so,\r\ncould I consent longer to hold it. But paramount considerations\r\nforbid, and I herewith transmit to you my commission respectfully\r\nasking you to accept my resignation.\r\n\r\nWhile I deem it a duty to myself to take this step, I feel called on\r\nto state the reasons that influence me.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the duties of the office in question, I complied with\r\nthe requirements of the law, by taking an oath \"_to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States_.\" I regret that I ever took that\r\noath. Had I then as maturely considered its full import, and the\r\nobligations under which it is understood, and meant to lay those who\r\ntake it, as I have done since, I certainly never would have taken it,\r\nseeing, as I now do, that the Constitution of the United States\r\ncontains provisions calculated and intended to foster, cherish, uphold\r\nand perpetuate _slavery_. It pledges the country to guard and protect\r\nthe slave system so long as the slaveholding States choose to retain\r\nit. It regards the slave code as lawful in the States which enact it.\r\nStill more, \"it has done that, which, until its adoption, was never\r\nbefore done for African slavery. It took it out of its former category\r\nof municipal law and local life, adopted it as a national institution,\r\nspread around it the broad and sufficient shield of national law, and\r\nthus gave to slavery a national existence.\" Consequently, the oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States is a solemn promise to\r\ndo that which is morally wrong; that which is a violation of the\r\nnatural rights of man, and a sin in the sight of God.\r\n\r\nI am not, in this matter, constituting myself a judge of others. I do\r\nnot say that no honest man can take such an oath, and abide by it. I\r\nonly say, that _I_ would not now deliberately take it; and that,\r\nhaving inconsiderately taken it, I can no longer suffer it to lie upon\r\nmy soul. I take back the oath, and ask you, sir, to take back the\r\ncommission, which was the occasion of my taking it.\r\n\r\nI am aware that my course in this matter is liable to be regarded as\r\nsingular, if not censurable; and I must, therefore, be allowed to make\r\na more specific statement of those _provisions of the Constitution_\r\nwhich support the enormous wrong, the heinous sin of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe very first Article of the Constitution takes slavery at once under\r\nits legislative protection, as a basis of representation in the\r\npopular branch of the National Legislature. It regards slaves under\r\nthe description \"of all other _persons_\"--as of only three-fifths of\r\nthe value of free persons; thus to appearance undervaluing them in\r\ncomparison with freemen. But its dark and involved phraseology seems\r\nintended to blind us to the consideration, that those underrated\r\nslaves are merely a _basis_, not the _source_ of representation; that\r\nby the laws of all the States where they live, they are regarded not\r\nas _persons_, but as _things_; that they are not the _constituency_ of\r\nthe representative, but his property; and that the necessary effect of\r\nthis provision of the Constitution is, to take legislative power out\r\nof the hands of _men_ as such, and give it to the mere possessors of\r\ngoods and chattels. Fixing upon thirty thousand persons, as the\r\nsmallest number that shall send one member into the House of\r\nRepresentatives, it protects slavery by distributing legislative power\r\nin a free and in a slave State thus: To a congressional district in\r\nSouth Carolina, containing fifty thousand slaves, claimed as the\r\nproperty of five hundred whites, who hold, on an average, one hundred\r\napiece, it gives one Representative in Congress; to a district in\r\nMassachusetts containing a population of thirty thousand five hundred,\r\none Representative is assigned. But inasmuch as a slave is never\r\npermitted to vote, the fifty thousand persons in a district in\r\nCarolina form no part of \"the constituency;\" _that_ is found only in\r\nthe five hundred free persons. Five hundred freemen of Carolina could\r\nsend one Representative to Congress, while it would take thirty\r\nthousand five hundred freemen of Massachusetts, to do the same thing;\r\nthat is, one slaveholder in Carolina is clothed by the Constitution\r\nwith the same political power and influence in the Representatives\r\nHall at Washington, as sixty Massachusetts men like you and me, who\r\n\"eat their bread in the sweat of their own brows.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1830, and the _ratio_ of representation\r\nbased upon that, slave property added twenty-five members to the House\r\nof Representatives. And as it has been estimated, (as an approximation\r\nto the truth,) that the two and a half million slaves in the United\r\nStates are held as property by about two hundred and fifty thousand\r\npersons--giving an average of ten slaves to each slaveholder, those\r\ntwenty-five Representatives, each chosen, at most, by only ten\r\nthousand voters, and probably by less than three-fourths of that\r\nnumber, were the representatives, not only of the two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand persons who chose them; but of _property_ which, five\r\nyears ago, when slaves were lower in market, than at present, were\r\nestimated, by the man who is now the most prominent candidate for the\r\nPresidency, at twelve hundred millions of dollars--a sum, which, by\r\nthe natural increase of five years, and the enhanced value resulting\r\nfrom a more prosperous state of the planting interest, cannot now be\r\nless than fifteen hundred millions of dollars. All this vast amount of\r\nproperty, as it is \"peculiar,\" is also identical in its character. In\r\nCongress, as we have seen, it is animated by one spirit, moves in one\r\nmass, and is wielded with one aim; and when we consider that tyranny\r\nis always timid, and despotism distrustful, we see that this vast\r\nmoney power would be false to itself, did it not direct all its eyes\r\nand hands, and put forth all its ingenuity and energy, to one\r\nend--self-protection and self-perpetuation. And this it has ever done.\r\nIn all the vibrations of the political scale, whether in relation to a\r\nBank or Sub-Treasury, Free Trade or a Tariff, this immense power has\r\nmoved, and will continue to move, in one mass, for its own protection.\r\n\r\nWhile the weight of the slave influence is thus felt in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, \"in the Senate of the Union,\" says John Quincy Adams,\r\n\"the proportion of slaveholding power is still greater. By the\r\ninfluence of slavery in the States where the institution is tolerated,\r\nover their elections, no other than a slaveholder can rise to the\r\ndistinction of obtaining a seat in the Senate; and thus, of the\r\nfifty-two members of the federal Senate, twenty-six are owners of\r\nslaves, and are as effectually representatives of that interest, as\r\nthe eighty-eight members elected by them to the House.\"\r\n\r\nThe dominant power which the Constitution gives to the slave interest,\r\nas thus seen and exercised in the _Legislative Halls_ of our nation,\r\nis equally obvious and obtrusive in every other department of the\r\nNational government.\r\n\r\nIn the _Electoral college_, the same cause produces the same\r\neffect--the same power is wielded for the same purpose, as in the\r\nHalls of Congress. Even the preliminary nominating conventions, before\r\nthey dare name a candidate for the highest office in the gift of the\r\npeople, must ask of the Genius of slavery, to what votary she will\r\nshow herself propitious. This very year, we see both the great\r\npolitical parties doing homage to the slave power, by nominating each\r\na slaveholder for the chair of State. The candidate of one party\r\ndeclares, \"I should have opposed, and would continue to oppose, any\r\nscheme whatever of emancipation, either gradual or immediate;\" and\r\nadds, \"It is not true, and I rejoice that it is not true, that either\r\nof the two great parties of this country has any design or aim at\r\nabolition. I should deeply lament it, if it were true.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Henry Clay's speech in the United States Senate in 1839,\r\nand confirmed at Raleigh, N.C. 1844.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other party nominates a man who says, \"I have no hesitation in\r\ndeclaring that I am in favor of the immediate re-annexation of Texas\r\nto the territory and government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThus both the political parties, and the candidates of both, vie with\r\neach other, in offering allegiance to the slave power, as a condition\r\nprecedent to any hope of success in the struggle for the executive\r\nchair; a seat that, for more than three-fourths of the existence of\r\nour constitutional government, has been occupied by a slaveholder.\r\n\r\nThe same stern despotism overshadows even the sanctuaries of justice.\r\nOf the nine Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, five\r\nare slaveholders and of course, must be faithless to their own\r\ninterest, as well as recreant to the power that gives them place, or\r\nmust, so far as _they_ are concerned, give both to law and\r\nconstitution such a construction as shall justify the language of John\r\nQuincy Adams, when he says--\"The legislative, executive, and judicial\r\nauthorities, are all in their hands--for the preservation,\r\npropagation, and perpetuation of the black code of slavery. Every law\r\nof the legislature becomes a link in the chain of the slave; every\r\nexecutive act a rivet to his hapless fate; every judicial decision a\r\nperversion of the human intellect to the justification of wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThus by merely adverting but briefly to the theory and the practical\r\neffect of this clause of the Constitution, that I have sworn to\r\nsupport, it is seen that it throws the political power of the nation\r\ninto the hands of the slaveholders; a body of men, which, however it\r\nmay be regarded by the Constitution as \"persons,\" is in fact and\r\npractical effect, a vast moneyed corporation, bound together by an\r\nindissoluble unity of interest, by a common sense of a common danger;\r\ncounselling at all times for its common protection; wielding the whole\r\npower, and controlling the destiny of the nation.\r\n\r\nIf we look into the legislative halls, slavery is seen in the chair of\r\nthe presiding officer of each, and controlling the action of both.\r\nSlavery occupies, by prescriptive right, the Presidential chair. The\r\nparamount voice that comes from the temple of national justice, issues\r\nfrom the lips of slavery. The army is in the hands of slavery, and at\r\nher bidding, must encamp in the everglades of Florida, or march from\r\nthe Missouri to the borders of Mexico, to look after her interests in\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThe navy, even that part that is cruising off the coast of Africa, to\r\nsuppress the foreign slave trade, is in the hands of slavery.\r\n\r\nFreemen of the North, who have even dared to lift up their voice\r\nagainst slavery, cannot travel through the slave States, but at the\r\nperil of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of freemen are forbidden, on the floor on\r\nCongress, to remonstrate against the encroachments of slavery, or to\r\npray that she would let her poor victims go.\r\n\r\nI renounce my allegiance to a Constitution that enthrones such a\r\npower, wielded for the purpose of depriving me of my rights, of\r\nrobbing my countrymen of their liberties, and of securing its own\r\nprotection, support and perpetuation.\r\n\r\nPassing by that clause of the Constitution, which restricted Congress\r\nfor twenty years, from passing any law against the African slave\r\ntrade, and which gave authority to raise a revenue on the stolen sons\r\nof Africa, I come to that part of the fourth article, which guarantees\r\nprotection against \"_domestic violence_,\" and which pledges to the\r\nSouth the military force of the country, to protect the masters\r\nagainst their insurgent slaves: binds us, and our children, to shoot\r\ndown our fellow-countrymen, who may rise, in emulation of our\r\nrevolutionary fathers, to vindicate their inalienable \"right to life,\r\n_liberty_ and the pursuit of happiness,\"--this clause of the\r\nConstitution, I say distinctly, I never will support.\r\n\r\nThat part of the Constitution which provides for the surrender of\r\nfugitive slaves, I never have supported and never will. I will join in\r\nno slave-hunt. My door shall stand open, as it has long stood, for the\r\npanting and trembling victim of the slave-hunter. When I shut it\r\nagainst him, may God shut the door of her mercy against me! Under this\r\nclause of the Constitution, and designed to carry it into effect,\r\nslavery has demanded that laws should be passed, and of such a\r\ncharacter, as have left the free citizen of the North without\r\nprotection for his own liberty. The question, whether a man seized in\r\na free State as a slave, _is_ a slave or not, the law of Congress does\r\nnot allow a jury to determine: but refers it to the decision of a\r\nJudge of a United State' Court, or even of the humblest State\r\nmagistrate, it may be, upon the testimony or affidavit of the party\r\nmost deeply interested to support the claim. By virtue of this law,\r\nfreemen have been seized and dragged into perpetual slavery--and\r\nshould I be seized by a slave-hunter in any part of the country where\r\nI am not personally known, neither the Constitution nor laws of the\r\nUnited States would shield me from the same destiny.\r\n\r\nThese, sir, are the specific parts of the Constitution of the united\r\nStates, which in my opinion are essentially vicious, hostile at once\r\nto the liberty and to the morals of the nation. And these are the\r\nprincipal reasons of my refusal any longer to acknowledge my\r\nallegiance to it, and of my determination to revoke my oath to support\r\nit. I cannot, in order to keep the law of man, break the law of God,\r\nor solemnly call him to witness my promise that I will break it.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Constitution provides for its own amendment, and\r\nthat by this process, all the guarantees of Slavery may be expunged.\r\nBut it will be time enough to swear to support it when this is done.\r\nIt cannot be right to do so, until these amendments are made.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that the framers of the Constitution did studiously\r\nkeep the words \"Slave\" and \"Slavery\" from its face. But to do our\r\nconstitutional fathers justice, while they forebore--from very\r\nshame--to give the word \"Slavery\" a place in the Constitution, they\r\ndid not forbear--again to do them justice--to give place in it to the\r\n_thing_. They were careful to wrap up the idea, and the substance of\r\nSlavery, in the clause for the surrender of the fugitive, though they\r\nsacrificed justice in doing so.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that this clause touching \"persons held to\r\nservice or labor,\" not only operates practically, under the judicial\r\nconstruction, for the protection of the slave interest; but that it\r\nwas _intended_ so to operate by the framers of the Constitution. The\r\nhighest judicial authorities--Chief Justice Shaw, of the Supreme Court\r\nof Massachusetts, in the Latimer case, and Mr. Justice Story, in the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, in the case of _Prigg vs. The\r\nState of Pennsylvania_,--tell us, I know not on what evidence, that\r\nwithout this \"compromise,\" this security for Southern slaveholders,\r\n\"the Union could not have been formed.\" And there is still higher\r\nevidence, not only that the framers of the Constitution meant by this\r\nclause to protect slavery, but that they did this, knowing that\r\nslavery was wrong. Mr. Madison[12] informs us that the clause in\r\nquestion, as it came out of the hands of Dr. Johnson, the chairman of\r\nthe \"committee on style,\" read thus: \"No person legally held to\r\nservice, or labor, in one State, escaping into another, shall,\" &c.,\r\nand the word \"legally\" was struck out, and the words \"under the laws\r\nthereof\" inserted after the word \"State,\" in compliance with the wish\r\nof some, who thought the term _legal_ equivocal, and favoring the idea\r\nthat slavery was legal \"_in a moral view_.\" A conclusive proof that,\r\nalthough future generations might apply that clause to other kinds of\r\n\"service or labor,\" when slavery should have died out, or been killed\r\noff by the young spirit of liberty, which was _then_ awake and at work\r\nin the land; still, slavery was what they were wrapping up in\r\n\"equivocal\" words: and wrapping it up for its protection and safe\r\nkeeping: a conclusive proof that the framers of the Constitution were\r\nmore careful to protect themselves in the judgement of coming\r\ngenerations, from the charge of ignorance, than of sin; a conclusive\r\nproof that they knew that slavery was not \"legal in a moral view,\"\r\nthat it was a violation of the moral law of God; and yet knowing and\r\nconfessing its immorality, they dared to make this stipulation for its\r\nsupport and defence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Madison Papers, p. 1589.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis language may sound harsh to the ears of those who think it a part\r\nof their duty, as citizens, to maintain that whatever the patriots of\r\nthe revolution did, was right; and who hold that we are bound to _do_\r\nall the iniquity that they covenanted for us that we _should_ do. But\r\nthe claims of truth and right are paramount to all other claims.\r\n\r\nWith all our veneration for our constitutional fathers, we must\r\nadmit,--for they have left on record their own confession of\r\nit,--that in this part of their work they _intended_ to hold the\r\nshield of their protection over a wrong, knowing that it was a wrong.\r\nThey made a \"compromise\" which they had no right to make--a compromise\r\nof moral principle for the sake of what they probably regarded as\r\n\"political expediency.\" I am sure they did not know--no man could\r\nknow, or can now measure, the extent, or the consequences of the wrong\r\nthat they were doing. In the strong language of John Quincy Adams,[13]\r\nin relation to the article fixing the basis of representation, \"Little\r\ndid the members of the Convention, from the free States, imagine or\r\nforesee what a sacrifice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this\r\nconcession.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See his Report on the Massachusetts Resolutions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI verily believe that, giving all due consideration to the benefits\r\nconferred upon this nation by the Constitution, its national unity,\r\nits swelling masses of wealth, its power, and the external prosperity\r\nof its multiplying millions; yet the _moral_ injury that has been\r\ndone, by the countenance shown to slavery by holding over that\r\ntremendous sin the shield of the Constitution, and thus breaking down\r\nin the eyes of the nation the barrier between right and wrong; by so\r\ntenderly cherishing slavery as, in less than the life of man, to\r\nmultiply her children from half a million to nearly three millions; by\r\nexacting oaths from those who occupy prominent stations in society,\r\nthat they will violate at once the rights of man and the law of God;\r\nby substituting itself as a rule of right, in place of the moral laws\r\nof the universe;--thus in effect, dethroning the Almighty in the\r\nhearts of this people and setting up another sovereign in his\r\nstead--more than outweighs it all. A melancholy and monitory lesson\r\nthis, to all time-serving and temporising statesmen! A striking\r\nillustration of the _impolicy_ of sacrificing _right_ to any\r\nconsiderations of expediency! Yet, what better than the evil effects\r\nthat we have seen, could the authors of the Constitution have\r\nreasonably expected, from the sacrifice of right, in the concessions\r\nthey made to slavery? Was it reasonable in them to expect that after\r\nthey had introduced a vicious element into the very Constitution of\r\nthe body politic which they were calling into life, it would not exert\r\nits vicious energies? Was it reasonable in them to expect that, after\r\nslavery had been corrupting the public morals for a whole generation,\r\ntheir children would have too much virtue to _use_ for the defence of\r\nslavery, a power which they themselves had not too much virtue to\r\n_give_? It is dangerous for the sovereign power of a State to license\r\nimmorality; to hold the shield of its protection over any thing that\r\nis not \"legal in a moral view.\" Bring into your house a benumbed\r\nviper, and lay it down upon your warm hearth, and soon it will not ask\r\nyou into which room it may crawl. Let Slavery once lean upon the\r\nsupporting arm, and bask in the fostering smile of the State, and you\r\nwill soon see, as we now see, both her minions and her victims\r\nmultiply apace till the politics, the morals, the liberties, even the\r\nreligion of the nation, are brought completely under her control.\r\n\r\nTo me, it appears that the virus of slavery, introduced into the\r\nConstitution of our body politic, by a few slight punctures, has now\r\nso pervaded and poisoned the whole system of our National Government,\r\nthat literally there is no health in it. The only remedy that I can\r\nsee for the disease, is to be found in the _dissolution of the\r\npatient_.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, both in theory and practice, is\r\nso utterly broken down by the influence and effects of slavery, so\r\nimbecile for the highest good of the nation, and so powerful for evil,\r\nthat I can give no voluntary assistance in holding it up any longer.\r\n\r\nHenceforth it is dead to me, and I to it. I withdraw all profession of\r\nallegiance to it, and all my voluntary efforts to sustain it. The\r\nburdens that it lays upon me, while it is held up by others, I shall\r\nendeavor to bear patiently, yet acting with reference to a higher law,\r\nand distinctly declaring, that while I retain my own liberty, I will\r\nbe a part to no compact, which helps to rob any other man of his.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your friend,\r\n\r\nFRANCIS JACKSON.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFROM\r\n\r\nMR. WEBSTER'S SPEECH\r\n\r\nAT NIBLO'S GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\"We have slavery, already, amongst us. The Constitution found it among\r\nus; it recognized it and gave it SOLEMN GUARANTIES. To the full extent\r\nof these guaranties we are all bound, in honor, in justice, and by the\r\nConstitution. All the stipulations, contained in the Constitution, _in\r\nfavor of the slaveholding States_ which are already in the Union,\r\nought to be fulfilled, and so far as depends on me, shall be\r\nfulfilled, in the fulness of their spirit, and to the exactness of\r\ntheir letter.\"!!!\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM\r\n\r\nJOHN Q. ADAMS'S ADDRESS\r\n\r\nAT NORTH BRIDGEWATER, NOV. 6, 1844.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of the Constitution of the United States, were the\r\nrestoration of credit and reputation, to the country--the revival of\r\ncommerce, navigation, and ship-building--the acquisition of the means\r\nof discharging the debts of the Revolution, and the protection and\r\nencouragement of the infant and drooping manufactures of the country.\r\nAll this, however, as is now well ascertained, was insufficient to\r\npropitiate the rulers of the Southern States to the adoption of the\r\nConstitution. What they specially wanted was _protection_.--Protection\r\nfrom the powerful and savage tribes of Indians within their\r\nborders, and who were harrassing them with the most terrible of\r\nwars--and protection from their own negroes--protection from their\r\ninsurrections--protection from their escape--protection even to the\r\ntrade by which they were brought into the country--protection, shall I\r\nnot blush to say, protection to the very bondage by which they were\r\nheld. Yes! it cannot be denied--the slaveholding lords of the South\r\nprescribed, as a condition of their assent to the Constitution, three\r\nspecial provisions to secure the perpetuity of their dominion over\r\ntheir slaves. The first was the immunity for twenty years of\r\npreserving the African slave-trade; the second was the stipulation to\r\nsurrender fugitive slaves--an engagement positively prohibited by the\r\nlaws of God, delivered from Sinai; and thirdly, the exaction fatal to\r\nthe principles of popular representation, of a representation for\r\nslaves--for articles of merchandise, under the name of persons.\r\n\r\nThe reluctance with which the freemen of the North submitted to the\r\ndictation of these conditions, is attested by the awkward and\r\nambiguous language in which they are expressed. The word slave is\r\nmost cautiously and fastidiously excluded from the whole instrument. A\r\nstranger, who should come from a foreign land, and read the\r\nConstitution of the United States, would not believe that slavery or a\r\nslave existed within the borders of our country. There is not word in\r\nthe Constitution _apparently_ bearing up on the condition of slavery,\r\nnor is there a provision but would be susceptible of practical\r\nexecution if there were not a slave in the land.\r\n\r\nThe delegates from South Carolina and Georgia distinctly avowed that,\r\nwithout this guarantee of protection to their property in slaves, they\r\nwould not yield their assent to the Constitution; and the freemen of\r\nthe North, reduced to the alternative of departing from the vital\r\nprinciple of their liberty, or of forfeiting the Union itself, averted\r\ntheir faces, and with trembling hand subscribed the bond.\r\n\r\nTwenty years passed away--the slave markets of the South were\r\nsaturated with the blood of African bondage, and from midnight of the\r\n31st December, 1807, not a slave from Africa was suffered ever more to\r\nbe introduced upon our soil. But the internal traffic was still\r\nlawful, and the _breeding_ States soon reconciled themselves to a\r\nprohibition which gave them the monopoly of the interdicted trade, and\r\nthey joined the full chorus of reprobation, to punish with death the\r\nslave-trader from Africa, while they cherished and shielded and\r\nenjoyed the precious profits of the American slave-trade exclusively\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this unhappy result of their concession had not altogether\r\nescaped the foresight of the freemen of the North; but their intense\r\nanxiety for the preservation of the whole Union, and the habit already\r\nformed of yielding to the somewhat peremptory and overbearing tone\r\nwhich the relation of master and slave welds into the nature of the\r\nlord, prevailed with them to overlook this consideration, the internal\r\nslave-trade having scarcely existed while that with Africa had been\r\nallowed. But of one consequence which has followed from the slave\r\nrepresentation, pervading the whole organic structure of the\r\nConstitution, they certainly were not prescient; for if they had been,\r\nnever--no, never would they have consented to it.\r\n\r\nThe representation, ostensibly of slaves, under the name of persons,\r\nwas in its operation an exclusive grant of power to one class of\r\nproprietors, owners of one species of property, to the detriment of\r\nall the rest of the community. This species of property was odious in\r\nits nature, held in direct violation of the natural and inalienable\r\nrights of man, and of the vital principles of Christianity; it was all\r\naccumulated in one geographical section of the country, and was all\r\nheld by wealthy men, comparatively small in numbers, not amounting to\r\na tenth part of the free white population of the States in which it\r\nwas concentrated.\r\n\r\nIn some of the ancient, and in some modern republics, extraordinary\r\npolitical power and privileges have been invested in the owners of\r\nhorses; but then these privileges and these powers have been granted\r\nfor the equivalent of extraordinary duties and services to the\r\ncommunity, required of the favored class. The Roman knights\r\nconstituted the cavalry of their armies, and the bushels of rings\r\ngathered by Hannibal from their dead bodies, after the battle of\r\nCannae, amply prove that the special powers conferred upon them were\r\nno gratuitous grants. But in the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthe political power invested in the owners of slaves is entirely\r\ngratuitous. No extraordinary service is required of them; they are, on\r\nthe contrary, themselves grievous burdens upon the community, always\r\nthreatened with the danger of insurrections, to be smothered in the\r\nblood of both parties, master and slave, and always depressing the\r\ncondition of the poor free laborer, by competition with the labor of\r\nthe slave. The property in horses was the gift of God to man, at the\r\ncreation of the world; the property in slaves is property acquired and\r\nheld by crimes, differing in no moral aspect from the pillage of a\r\nfreebooter, and to which no lapse of time can give a prescriptive\r\nright. You are told that this is no concern of yours, and that the\r\nquestion of freedom and slavery is exclusively reserved to the\r\nconsideration of the separate States. But if it be so, as to the mere\r\nquestion of right between master and slave, it is of tremendous\r\nconcern to you that this little cluster of slave-owners should\r\npossess, besides their own share in the representative hall of the\r\nnation, the exclusive privilege of appointing two-fifths of the whole\r\nnumber of the representatives of the people. This is now your\r\ncondition, under that delusive ambiguity of language and of principle,\r\nwhich begins by declaring the representation in the popular branch of\r\nthe legislature a representation of persons, and then provides that\r\none class of persons shall have neither part nor lot in the choice of\r\ntheir representative; but their elective franchise shall he\r\ntransferred to their masters, and the oppressors shall represent the\r\noppressed. The same perversion of the representative principle\r\npollutes the composition of the colleges of electors of President and\r\nVice President of the United States, and every department of the\r\ngovernment of the Union is thus tainted at its source by the gangrene\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens,--with a body of men thus composed, for legislators\r\nand executors of the laws, what will, what must be, what has been your\r\nlegislation? The numbers of freemen constituting your nation are much\r\ngreater than those of the slaveholding States, bond and free. You have\r\nat least three-fifths of the whole population of the Union. Your\r\ninfluence on the legislation and the administration of the government\r\nought to be in the proportion of three to two.--But how stands the\r\nfact? Besides the legitimate portion of influence exercised by the\r\nslaveholding States by the measure of their numbers, here is an\r\nintrusive influence in every department, by a representation nominally\r\nof persons, but really of property, ostensibly of slaves, but\r\neffectively of their masters, overbalancing your superiority of\r\nnumbers, adding two-fifths of supplementary power to the two-fifths\r\nfairly secured to them by the compact, CONTROLLING AND OVERRULING THE\r\nWHOLE ACTION OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AT HOME AND ABROAD, and warping it to\r\nthe sordid private interest and oppressive policy of 300,000 owners of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the adoption of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, the institution of domestic slavery has been becoming more and\r\nmore the abhorrence of the civilized world. But in proportion as it\r\nhas been growing odious to all the rest of mankind, it has been\r\nsinking deeper and deeper into the affections of the holders of\r\nslaves themselves. The cultivation of cotton and of sugar, unknown in\r\nthe Union at the establishment of the Constitution, has added largely\r\nto the pecuniary value of the slave. And the suppression of the\r\nAfrican slave-trade as piracy upon pain of death, by securing the\r\nbenefit of a monopoly to the virtuous slaveholders of the ancient\r\ndominion, has turned her heroic tyrannicides into a community of\r\nslave-breeders for sale, and converted the land of George Washington,\r\nPatrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, and Thomas Jefferson, into a great\r\nbarracoon--a cattle-show of human beings, an emporium, of which the\r\nstaple articles of merchandise are the flesh and blood, the bones and\r\nsinews of immortal man.\r\n\r\nOf the increasing abomination of slavery in the unbought hearts of men\r\nat the time when the Constitution of the United States was formed,\r\nwhat clearer proof could be desired, than that the very same year in\r\nwhich that charter of the land was issued, the Congress of the\r\nConfederation, with not a tithe of the powers given by the people to\r\nthe Congress of the new compact, actually abolished slavery for ever\r\nthroughout the whole Northwestern territory, without a remonstrance or\r\na murmur. But in the articles of confederation, there was no guaranty\r\nfor the property of the slaveholder--no double representation of him\r\nin the Federal councils--no power of taxation--no stipulation for the\r\nrecovery of fugitive slaves. But when the powers of _government_ came\r\nto be delegated to the Union, the--that is, South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia--refused their subscription to the parchment, till it should\r\nbe saturated with the infection of slavery, which no fumigation could\r\npurify, no quarantine could extinguish. The freemen of the North gave\r\nway, and the deadly venom of slavery was infused into the Constitution\r\nof freedom. Its first consequence has been to invert the first\r\nprinciple of Democracy, that the will of the majority of numbers shall\r\nrule the land. By means of the double representation, the minority\r\ncommand the whole, and a KNOT OF SLAVEHOLDERS GIVE THE LAW AND\r\nPRESCRIBE THE POLICY OF THE COUNTRY. To acquire this superiority of a\r\nlarge majority of freemen, a persevering system of engrossing nearly\r\nall the seats of power and place, is constantly for a long series of\r\nyears pursued, and you have seen, in a period of fifty-six years, the\r\nChief-magistracy of the Union held, during forty-four of them, by the\r\nowners of slaves. The Executive departments, the Army and Navy, the\r\nSupreme Judicial Court and diplomatic missions abroad, all present the\r\nsame spectacle;--an immense majority of power in the hands of a very\r\nsmall minority of the people--millions made for a fraction of a few\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFrom that day (1830,) SLAVERY, SLAVEHOLDING, SLAVE-BREEDING AND\r\nSLAVE-TRADING, HAVE FORMED THE WHOLE FOUNDATION OF THE POLICY OF THE\r\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT, and of the slaveholding States, at home and\r\nabroad; and at the very time when a new census has exhibited a large\r\nincrease upon the superior numbers of the free States, it has\r\npresented the portentous evidence of increased influence and\r\nascendancy of the slaveholding power.\r\n\r\nOf the prevalence of that power, you have had continual and conclusive\r\nevidence in the suppression for the space of ten years of the right of\r\npetition, guarantied, if there could be a guarantee against slavery,\r\nby the first article amendatory of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTI-SLAVERY EXAMINER.--NO.

We have extracted from them, in these pages, all\r\nthe Debates on those clauses of the Constitution which relate to\r\nslavery. To these we have added all that is found, on the same topic,\r\nin the Debates of the several State Conventions which ratified the\r\nConstitution: together with so much of the Speech of Luther Martin\r\nbefore the Legislature of Maryland, and of the Federalist, as relate\r\nto our subject; with some extracts, also, from the Debates of the\r\nfirst Federal Congress on Slavery. These are all printed without\r\nalteration, except that, in some instances, we have inserted in\r\nbrackets, after the name of a speaker, the name of the State from\r\nwhich he came. The notes and italics are those of the original, but\r\nthe editor has added two notes on page 38, which are marked as his,\r\nand we have taken the liberty of printing in capitals one sentiment of\r\nRufus King's, and two of James Madison's--a distinction which the\r\nimportance of the statements seemed to demand--otherwise we have\r\nreprinted exactly from the originals.\r\n\r\nThese extracts develop most clearly all the details of that\r\n\"compromise,\" which was made between freedom and slavery, in 1787;\r\ngranting to the slaveholder distinct privileges and protection for his\r\nslave property, in return for certain commercial concessions on his\r\npart toward the North. They prove also that the Nation at large were\r\nfully aware of this bargain at the time, and entered into it willingly\r\nand with open eyes.\r\n\r\nWe have added the late \"Address of the American Anti-Slavery Society,\"\r\nand the Letter of FRANCIS JACKSON to Governor BRIGGS, resigning his\r\ncommission of Justice of the Peace--as bold and honorable protests\r\nagainst the guilt and infamy of this National bargain, and as proving\r\nmost clearly the duty of each individual to trample it under his feet.\r\nThe clauses of the Constitution to which we refer as of a pro-slavery\r\ncharacter are the following :--\r\n\r\nART. 1, SECT. 2.--Representatives and direct taxes shall be\r\napportioned among the several States, which may be included within\r\nthis Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be\r\ndetermined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including\r\nthose bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not\r\ntaxed, _three-fifths of all other persons_.\r\n\r\nART. 1, SECT. 8.--Congress shall have power . . . to suppress\r\ninsurrections.\r\n\r\nART. 1, SECT. 9.--The migration or importation of such persons as any\r\nof the States now existing, shall think proper to admit, shall not be\r\nprohibited by the Congress, prior to the year one thousand eight\r\nhundred and eight: but a tax or duty may be imposed on such\r\nimportation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\r\n\r\nART. 4, SECT. 2.--No person, held to service or labor in one State,\r\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence\r\nof any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or\r\nlabor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\r\nservice or labor may be due.\r\n\r\nART. 4, SECT. 4.--The United States shall guarantee to every State in\r\nthis Union a republican form of government; and shall protect each of\r\nthem against invasion; and, on application of the legislature, or of\r\nthe executive, (when the legislature cannot be convened) _against\r\ndomestic violence_.\r\n\r\nThe first of these clauses, relating to representation, confers on a\r\nslaveholding community additional political power for every slave held\r\namong them, and thus tempts them to continue to uphold the system: the\r\nsecond and the last, relating to insurrection and domestic violence,\r\nperfectly innocent in themselves--yet being made with the fact\r\ndirectly in view that slavery exists among us, do deliberately pledge\r\nthe whole national force against the unhappy slave if he imitate our\r\nfathers and resist oppression--thus making us partners in the guilt of\r\nsustaining slavery: the third, relating to the slave-trade, disgraces\r\nthe nation by a pledge not to abolish that traffic till after twenty\r\nyears, _without obliging Congress to do so even then_, and thus the\r\nslave-trade may be legalized to-morrow if Congress choose: the fourth\r\nis a promise on the part of the whole Nation to return fugitive slaves\r\nto their masters, a deed which God's law expressly condemns and which\r\nevery noble feeling of our nature repudiates with loathing and\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nThese are the articles of the \"Compromise,\" so much talked of, between\r\nthe North and South.\r\n\r\nWe do not produce the extracts which make up these pages to show what\r\nis the meaning of the clauses above cited. For no man or party, of any\r\nauthority in such matters, has ever pretended to doubt to what subject\r\nthey all relate. If indeed they were ambiguous in their terms, a\r\nresort to the history of those times would set the matter at rest\r\nforever. A few persons, to be sure, of late years, to serve the\r\npurposes of a party, have tried to prove that the Constitution makes\r\nno compromise with slavery. Notwithstanding the clear light of\r\nhistory;--the unanimous decision of all the courts in the land, both\r\nState and Federal;--the action of Congress and the State\r\nLegislature;--the constant practice of the Executive in all its\r\nbranches;--and the deliberate acquiescence of the whole people for\r\nhalf a century, still they contend that the Nation does not know its\r\nown meaning, and that the Constitution does not tolerate slavery!\r\nEvery candid mind, however, must acknowledge that the language of the\r\nConstitution is clear and explicit.\r\n\r\nIts terms are so broad, it is said, that they include many others\r\nbeside slaves, and hence it is wisely (!) inferred that they cannot\r\ninclude the slaves themselves! Many persons besides slaves in this\r\ncountry doubtless are \"held to service and labor under the laws of the\r\nStates,\" but that does not at all show that slaves are not \"held to\r\nservice;\" many persons beside the slaves may take part \"in\r\ninsurrections,\" but that does not prove that when the slaves rise, the\r\nNational Government is not bound to put them down by force. Such a\r\nthing has been heard of before as one description including a great\r\nvariety of persons,--and this is the case in the present instance.\r\n\r\nBut granting that the terms of the Constitution are ambiguous--that\r\nthey are susceptible of two meanings, if the unanimous, concurrent,\r\nunbroken practice of every department of the Government, judicial,\r\nlegislative, and executive, and the acquiescence of the whole people\r\nfor fifty years do not prove which is the true construction, then how\r\nand where can such a question ever be settled? If the people and the\r\nCourts of the land do not know what they themselves mean, who has\r\nauthority to settle their meaning for them?\r\n\r\nIf then the people and the Courts of a country are to be allowed to\r\ndetermine what their own laws mean, it follows that at this time and\r\nfor the last half century, the Constitution of the United States has\r\nbeen, and still is, a pro-slavery instrument, and that any one who\r\nswears to support it, swears to do pro-slavery acts, and violates his\r\nduty both as a man and an abolitionist. What the Constitution may\r\nbecome a century hence, we know not; we speak of it _as it is_, and\r\nrepudiate it _as it is_.\r\n\r\nBut the purpose, for which we have thrown these pages before the\r\ncommunity, is this. Some men, finding the nation unanimously deciding\r\nthat the Constitution tolerates slavery, have tried to prove that this\r\nfalse construction, as they think it, has been foisted into the\r\ninstrument by the corrupting influence of slavery itself, tainting all\r\nit touches. They assert that the known anti-slavery spirit of\r\nrevolutionary times never _could_ have consented to so infamous a\r\nbargain as the Constitution is represented to be, and has in its\r\npresent hands become. Now these pages prove the melancholy fact, that\r\nwillingly, with deliberate purpose, our fathers bartered honesty for\r\ngain, and became partners with tyrants, that they might share in the\r\nprofits of their tyranny.\r\n\r\nAnd in view of this fact, will it not require a very strong argument\r\nto make any candid man believe, that the bargain which the fathers\r\ntell us they meant to incorporate into the Constitution, and which the\r\nsons have always thought they found there incorporated, does not exist\r\nthere, after all? Forty of the shrewdest men and lawyers in the land\r\nassemble to make a bargain, among other things, about slaves,--after\r\nmonths of anxious deliberation they put it into writing and sign their\r\nnames to the instrument,--fifty years roll away, twenty millions, at\r\nleast, of their children pass over the stage of life,--courts sit and\r\npass judgment,--parties arise and struggle fiercely; still all concur\r\nin finding in the instrument just that meaning which the fathers tell\r\nus they intended to express:--must not he be a desperate man, who,\r\nafter all this, sets out to prove that the fathers were bunglers and\r\nthe sons fools, and that slavery is not referred to at all?\r\n\r\nBesides, the advocates of this new theory of the Anti-slavery\r\ncharacter of the Constitution, quote some portions of the Madison\r\nPapers in support of their views,--and this makes it proper that the\r\ncommunity should hear _all_ that these Debates have to say on the\r\nsubject. The further we explore them, the clearer becomes the fact,\r\nthat the Constitution was meant to be, what it has always been\r\nesteemed, a compromise between slavery and freedom.\r\n\r\nIf then the Constitution be, what these Debates show that our fathers\r\nintended to make it, and what, too, their descendants, this nation,\r\nsay they did make it and agree to uphold,--then we affirm that it is a\r\n\"covenant with death and an agreement with hell,\" and ought to be\r\nimmediately annulled. No abolitionist can consistently take office\r\nunder it, or swear to support it.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the contrary, our fathers failed in their purpose, and the\r\nConstitution is all pure and untouched by slavery,--then, Union itself\r\nis impossible, without guilt. For it is undeniable that the fifty\r\nyears passed under this (anti-slavery) Constitution, show us the\r\nslaves trebling in numbers;--slaveholders monopolizing the offices and\r\ndictating the policy of the Government;--prostituting the strength and\r\ninfluence of the Nation to the support of slavery here and\r\nelsewhere;--trampling on the rights of the free States, and making the\r\ncourts of the country their tools. To continue this disastrous\r\nalliance longer is madness. The trial of fifty years with the best of\r\nmen and the best of Constitutions, on this supposition, only proves\r\nthat it is impossible for free and slave States to unite on any terms,\r\nwithout all becoming partners in the guilt and responsible for the sin\r\nof slavery. We dare not prolong the experiment, and with double\r\nearnestness we repeat our demand upon every honest man to join in the\r\noutcry of the American Anti-Slavery Society,--\r\n\r\nNO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nA PRO-SLAVERY COMPACT.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_Extracts from Debates in the Congress of Confederation, preserved by\r\nThomas Jefferson, 1776._\r\n\r\nCongress proceeded the same day to consider the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, * * *\r\n\r\nThe clause too reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was\r\nstruck out, in compliance to South Carolina and Georgia, who had never\r\nattempted to restrain the importation of Slaves, and who on the\r\ncontrary still wished to continue it. Our Northern brethren also, I\r\nbelieve, felt a little tender under those censures; for though their\r\npeople have very few slaves themselves, yet they had been pretty\r\nconsiderable carriers of them to others.--p. 18.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the twelfth of July, 1776, the committee appointed to draw\r\nthe articles of Confederation reported them, and on the twenty-second,\r\nthe House resolved themselves into a committee to take them into\r\nconsideration. On the thirtieth and thirty-first of that month, and\r\nthe first of the ensuing, those articles were debated which determined\r\nthe proportion or quota of money which each State should furnish to\r\nthe common treasury, and the manner of voting in Congress. The first\r\nof these articles was expressed in the original draught in these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\"Article 11. All charges of war and all other expenses that shall be\r\nincurred for the common defence, or general welfare, and allowed by\r\nthe United States assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common\r\ntreasury, which shall be supplied by the several Colonies in\r\nproportion to the number of inhabitants of every age, sex and duality,\r\nexcept Indians not paying taxes, in each Colony, a true account of\r\nwhich, distinguishing the white inhabitants, shall be triennially\r\ntaken and transmitted to the Assembly of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE (of Maryland) moved, that the quotas should be paid, not by\r\nthe number of inhabitants of every condition but by that of the \"white\r\ninhabitants.\" He admitted that taxation should be always in proportion\r\nto property; that this was in theory the true rule, but that from a\r\nvariety of difficulties it was a rule which could never be adopted in\r\npractice. The value of the property in every State could never be\r\nestimated justly and equally. Some other measure for the wealth of the\r\nState must therefore be devised, some standard referred to which\r\nwould be more simple. He considered the number of inhabitants as a\r\ntolerably good criterion of property, and that this might always be\r\nobtained. He therefore thought it the best mode we could adopt, with\r\none exception only. He observed that negroes are property, and as such\r\ncannot be distinguished from the lands or personalities held in those\r\nStates where there are few slaves. That the surplus of profit which a\r\nNorthern farmer is able to lay by, he invests in cattle, horses, &c.;\r\nwhereas, a Southern farmer lays out that same surplus in slaves. There\r\nis no more reason therefore for taxing the Southern States on the\r\nfarmer's head and on his slave's head, than the Northern ones on their\r\nfarmers' heads and the heads of their cattle. That the method proposed\r\nwould therefore tax the Southern States according to their numbers and\r\ntheir wealth conjunctly, while the Northern would be taxed on numbers\r\nonly: that negroes in fact should not be considered as members of the\r\nState, more than cattle, and that they have no more interest in it.\r\n\r\nMr. John Adams (of Massachusetts) observed, that the numbers of people\r\nwere taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the State and\r\nnot as subjects of taxation. That as to this matter it was of no\r\nconsequence by what name you called your people, whether by that of\r\nfreemen or of slaves. That in some countries the laboring poor were\r\ncalled freemen, in others they were called slaves: but that the\r\ndifference as to the state was imaginary only. What matters it whether\r\na landlord employing ten laborers on his farm gives them annually as\r\nmuch money as will buy them the necessaries of life, or gives them\r\nthose necessaries at short hand? The ten laborers add as much wealth\r\nannually to the State, increase its exports as much, in the one case\r\nas the other. Certainly five hundred freemen produce no more profits,\r\nno greater surplus for the payment of taxes, than five hundred slaves.\r\nTherefore the State in which are the laborers called freemen, should\r\nbe taxed no more than that in which are those called slaves. Suppose,\r\nby any extraordinary operation of nature or of law, one half the\r\nlaborers of a State could in the course of one night be transformed\r\ninto slaves,--would the State be made the poorer, or the less able to\r\npay taxes? That the condition of the laboring poor in most\r\ncountries,--that of the fishermen, particularly, of the Northern\r\nStates,--is as abject as that of slaves. It is the number of laborers\r\nwhich produces the surplus for taxation; and numbers, therefore,\r\nindiscriminately, are the fair index of wealth. That it is the use of\r\nthe word \"property\" here, and its application to some of the people of\r\nthe State, which produces the fallacy. How does the Southern farmer\r\nprocure slaves? Either by importation or by purchase from his\r\nneighbor. If he imports a slave, he adds one to the number of laborers\r\nin his country, and proportionably to its profits and abilities to pay\r\ntaxes; if he buys from his neighbor, it is only a transfer of a\r\nlaborer from one farm to another, which does not change the annual\r\nproduce of the State, and therefore should not change its tax; that if\r\na Northern farmer works ten laborers on his farm, he can, it is true,\r\ninvest the surplus of ten men's labor in cattle; but so may the\r\nSouthern farmer working ten slaves. That a State of one hundred\r\nthousand freemen can maintain no more cattle than one of one hundred\r\nthousand slaves; therefore they have no more of that kind of property.\r\nThat a slave may, indeed, from the custom of speech, be more properly\r\ncalled the wealth of his master, than the free laborer might be called\r\nthe wealth of his employer: but as to the State, both were equally its\r\nwealth, and should therefore equally add to the quota of its tax.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRISON (of Virginia) proposed, as a compromise, that two slaves\r\nshould be counted as one freeman. He affirmed that slaves did not do\r\nas much work as freemen, and doubted if two effected more than one.\r\nThat this was proved by the price of labor, the hire of a laborer in\r\nthe Southern colonies being from £8 to £12, while in the Northern it\r\nwas generally £24.\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON (of Pennsylvania) said, that if this amendment should take\r\nplace, the Southern colonies would have all the benefit of slaves,\r\nwhilst the Northern ones would bear the burthen. That slaves increase\r\nthe profits of a State, which the Southern States mean to take to\r\nthemselves; that they also increase the burthen of defence, which\r\nwould of course fall so much the heavier on the Northern; that slaves\r\noccupy the places of freemen and eat their food. Dismiss your slaves,\r\nand freemen will take their places. It is our duty to lay every\r\ndiscouragement on the importation of slaves; but this amendment would\r\ngive the _jus trium liberorum_ to him who would import slaves. That\r\nother kinds of property were pretty equally distributed through all\r\nthe Colonies: there were as many cattle, horses, and sheep, in the\r\nNorth as the South, and South as the North; but not so as to slaves:\r\nthat experience has shown that those colonies have been always able to\r\npay most, which have the most inhabitants, whether they be black or\r\nwhite; and the practice of the Southern colonies has always been to\r\nmake every farmer pay poll taxes upon all his laborers, whether they\r\nbe black or white. He acknowledged indeed that freemen worked the\r\nmost; but they consume the most also. They do not produce a greater\r\nsurplus for taxation. The slave is neither fed nor clothed so\r\nexpensively as a freeman. Again, white women are exempted from labor\r\ngenerally, which negro women are not. In this then the Southern States\r\nhave an advantage as the article now stands. It has sometimes been\r\nsaid that slavery was necessary, because the commodities they raise\r\nwould be too dear for market if cultivated by freemen; but now it is\r\nsaid that the labor of the slave is the dearest.\r\n\r\nMr. PAYNE (of Massachusetts) urged the original resolution of\r\nCongress, to proportion the quotas of the States to the number of\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nDr. WITHERSPOON (of New-Jersey) was of opinion, that the value of\r\nlands and houses was the best estimate of the wealth of a nation, and\r\nthat it was practicable to obtain such a valuation. This is the true\r\nbarometer of wealth. The one now proposed is imperfect in itself, and\r\nunequal between the States. It has been objected that negroes eat the\r\nfood of freemen, and therefore should be taxed: horses also eat the\r\nfood of freemen; therefore they also should be taxed. It has been said\r\ntoo, that in carrying slaves into the estimate of the taxes the State\r\nis to pay, we do no more than those States themselves do, who always\r\ntake slaves into the estimate of the taxes the individual is to pay.\r\nBut the cases are not parallel. In the Southern Colonies, slaves\r\npervade the whole Colony; but they do not pervade the whole continent.\r\nThat as to the original resolution of Congress, it was temporary only,\r\nand related to the moneys heretofore emitted: whereas we are now\r\nentering into a new compact, and therefore stand on original ground.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1st. The question being put, the amendment proposed was\r\nrejected by the votes of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island,\r\nConnecticut, New-York, New-Jersey and Pennsylvania, against those of\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North; and South Carolina. Georgia was\r\ndivided.--_pp_. 27-8-9, 30-1-2.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_Extracts from Madison's Report of Debates in the Congress of the\r\nConfederation._\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, January 14, 1783.\r\n\r\nIf the valuation of land had not been prescribed by the Federal\r\nArticles, the Committee would certainly have preferred some other rule\r\nof appointment, particularly that of numbers, under certain\r\nqualifications as to slaves.--_p_. 260\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, Feb. 11, 1783.\r\n\r\nMr. WOLCOTT declares his opinion that the Confederation ought to be\r\namended by substituting numbers of inhabitants as the rule; admits the\r\ndifference between freemen and blacks; and suggests a compromise, by\r\nincluding in the numeration such blacks only as were within sixteen\r\nand sixty years of age.--_p_. 331\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, March 27, 1783.\r\n\r\n(The eleventh and twelfth paragraphs:)\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON (of Pennsylvania) was strenuous in their favor; said he was\r\nin Congress when the Articles of Confederation directing a valuation\r\nof land were agreed to; that it was the effect of the impossibility of\r\ncompromising the different ideas of the Eastern and Southern States,\r\nas to the value of slaves compared with the whites, the alternative in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMr. CLARK (of New-Jersey) was in favor of them. He said that he was\r\nalso in Congress when this article was decided; that the Southern\r\nStates would have agreed to numbers in preference to the value of land\r\nif half their slaves only should be included; but that the Eastern\r\nStates would not concur in that proposition.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed, on all sides, that, instead of fixing the proportion by\r\nages, as the report proposed, it would be best to fix the proportion\r\nin absolute numbers. With this view, and that the blank might be\r\nfilled up, the clause was recommitted. _p_. 421-2.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, March 28, 1783.\r\n\r\nThe committee last mentioned, reported that two blacks be rated as one\r\nfreeman.\r\n\r\nMr. WOLCOTT (of Connecticut) was for rating them as four to three. Mr.\r\nCARROLL as four to one. Mr. WILLIAMSON (of North Carolina) said he\r\nwas principled against slavery; and that he thought slaves an\r\nincumbrance to society, instead of increasing its ability to pay\r\ntaxes. Mr. HIGGINSON (of Massachusetts) as four to three. Mr. RUTLEDGE\r\n(of South Carolina) said, for the sake of the object, he would agree\r\nto rate slaves as two to one, but he sincerely thought three to one\r\nwould be a juster proportion. Mr. HOLTON as four to three.--Mr. OSGOOD\r\nsaid he did not go beyond four to three. On a question for rating them\r\nas three to two, the votes were, New Hampshire, aye; Massachusetts,\r\nno; Rhode Island; divided; Connecticut, aye; New Jersey, aye;\r\nPennsylvania, aye; Delaware, aye; Maryland, no; Virginia, no; North\r\nCarolina, no; South Carolina, no. The paragraph was then postponed, by\r\ngeneral consent, some wishing for further time to deliberate on it;\r\nbut it appearing to be the general opinion that no compromise would be\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\nAfter some further discussions on the Report, in which the necessity\r\nof some simple and practicable rule of apportionment came fully into\r\nview, Mr. MADISON (of Virginia) said that, in order to give a proof of\r\nthe sincerity of his professions of liberality, he would propose that\r\nslaves should be rated as five to three. Mr. RUTLEDGE (of South\r\nCarolina) seconded the motion. Mr. WILSON (of Pennsylvania) said he\r\nwould sacrifice his opinion on this compromise.\r\n\r\nMr. LEE was against changing the rule, but gave it as his opinion that\r\ntwo slaves were not equal to one freeman.\r\n\r\nOn the question for five to three, it passed in the affirmative; New\r\nHampshire, aye; Massachusetts, divided; Rhode Island, no; Connecticut,\r\nno; New Jersey, aye; Pennsylvania, aye; Maryland, aye; Virginia, aye;\r\nNorth Carolina, aye; South Carolina, aye.\r\n\r\nA motion was then made by Mr. BLAND, seconded by Mr. LEE, to strike\r\nout the clause so amended, and, on the question \"Shall it stand,\" it\r\npassed in the negative; New Hampshire, aye; Massachusetts, no; Rhode\r\nIsland, no; Connecticut, no; New Jersey, aye; Pennsylvania, aye;\r\nDelaware, no; Maryland, aye; Virginia, aye; North Carolina, aye; South\r\nCarolina, no; so the clause was struck out.\r\n\r\nThe arguments used by those who were for rating slaves high were, that\r\nthe expense of feeding and clothing them was as far below that\r\nincident to freemen as their industry and ingenuity were below those\r\nof freemen; and that the warm climate within which the States having\r\nslaves lay, compared with the rigorous climate and inferior fertility\r\nof the others, ought to have great weight in the case; and that the\r\nexports of the former States were greater than of the latter. On the\r\nother side, it was said, that slaves were not put to labor as young as\r\nthe children of laboring families; that, having no interest in their\r\nlabor, they did as little as possible, and omitted every exertion of\r\nthought requisite to facilitate and expedite it; that if the exports\r\nof the States having slaves exceeded those of the others, their\r\nimports were in proportion, slaves employed wholly in agriculture, not\r\nin manufactures; and that, in fact, the balance of trade formerly was\r\nmuch more against the Southern States than the others.\r\n\r\nOn the main question, New Hampshire, aye; Massachusetts, no; Rhode\r\nIsland, no; Connecticut, no; New York (Mr. FLOYD, aye;) New Jersey,\r\naye; Delaware, no; Maryland, aye; Virginia, aye; North Carolina, aye;\r\nSouth Carolina, no.--_pp. 423-4-5_.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, April l, 1783.\r\n\r\nCongress resumed the Report on Revenue, &c. Mr. HAMILTON, who\r\nhad been absent when the last question was taken for substituting\r\nnumbers in place of the value of land, moved to reconsider that vote.\r\nHe was seconded by Mr. OSGOOD. Those who voted differently from\r\ntheir former votes were influenced by the conviction of the necessity\r\nof the change, and despair on both sides of a more favorable rate\r\nof the slaves. The rate of three-fifths was agreed to without\r\nopposition.--_p. 430_.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MAY 26, 1783.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions on the Journal instructing the ministers in Europe to\r\nremonstrate against the carrying off the negroes--also those for\r\nfurloughing the troops--passed _unanimously.--p. 456._\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_Letter from Mr. Madison to Edmund Randolph_.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, April 8, 1783.\r\n\r\nA change of the valuation of lands for the number of inhabitants,\r\ndeducting two-fifths of the slaves, has received a tacit sanction,\r\nand, unless hereafter expunged, will go forth in the general\r\nrecommendation, as material to future harmony and justice among the\r\nmembers of the Confederacy. The deduction of two-fifths was a\r\ncompromise between the wide opinions and demands of the Southern and\r\nother States.--_p. 523_.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n_Extract from \"Debates in the Federal Convention\" of 1787, for the\r\nformation of the Constitution of the United States_.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, May 29, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. CHARLES PINCKNEY laid before the House the draft of a Federal\r\nGovernment. * * * \"The proportion of direct taxation shall be\r\nregulated by the whole number of inhabitants of every\r\ndescription\"--_pp_. 735, 741.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, May 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nThe following Resolution, being the second of those proposed by Mr.\r\nRANDOLPH, was taken up, viz.\r\n\r\n\"_That the rights of suffrage in the National Legislature ought to be\r\nproportioned to the quotas of contribution, or to the number of free\r\ninhabitants, as the one or the other rule may seem best in different\r\ncases_.\"\r\n\r\nColonel HAMILTON moved to alter the resolution so as to read, \"that\r\nthe rights of suffrage in the National Legislature ought to be\r\nproportioned to the number of free inhabitants.\" Mr. SPAIGHT seconded\r\nthe motion.--_p_. 750.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, June 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. We have seen the mere distinction of color made, in the\r\nmost enlightened period of time, a ground of the most oppressive\r\ndominion ever exercised by man over man.--_p_. 806.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY, June 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN proposed, that the proportion of suffrage in the first\r\nbranch should be according to the respective numbers of free\r\ninhabitants;\r\n\r\nMr. RUTLEDGE proposed, that the proportion of suffrage in the first\r\nbranch should be according to the quotas of contribution.\r\n\r\nMr. KING and Mr. WILSON, in order to bring the question to a point,\r\nmoved, \"that the right of suffrage in the first branch of the National\r\nLegislature ought not to be according to the rule established in the\r\nArticles of Confederation, but according to some equitable ratio of\r\nrepresentation.\"--_p_. 836.\r\n\r\nIt was then moved by Mr. RUTLEDGE, seconded by Mr. BUTLER, to add to\r\nthe words, \"equitable ratio of representation,\" at the end of the\r\nmotion just agreed to, the words \"according to the quotas of\r\ncontribution.\" On motion of Mr. WILSON, seconded by Mr. PINCKNEY, this\r\nwas postponed; in order to add, after the words, \"equitable ratio of\r\nrepresentation,\" the words following: \"In proportion to the whole\r\nnumber of white and other free citizens and inhabitants of every age,\r\nsex and condition, including those bound to servitude for a term of\r\nyears, and three-fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the\r\nforegoing description, except Indians not paying taxes, in each\r\nState\"--this being the rule in the act of Congress, agreed to by\r\neleven States, for apportioning quotas of revenue on the States, and\r\nrequiring a census only every five, seven, or ten years.\r\n\r\nMr. GERRY (of Massachusetts) thought property not the rule of\r\nrepresentation. Why, then, should the blacks, who were property in the\r\nSouth, be in the rule of representation more than the cattle and\r\nhorses of the North?\r\n\r\nOn the question,--Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, aye--9;\r\nNew Jersey, Delaware, no--2.--_pp_. 842-3.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, June 19, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. Where slavery exists, the republican theory becomes still\r\nmore fallacious.--_p_. 899.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, June 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison,--admitted that every peculiar interest, whether in any\r\nclass of citizens, or any description of states, ought to be secured\r\nas far as possible. Wherever there is danger of attack, there ought to\r\nbe given a constitutional power of defence. But he contended that the\r\nStates were divided into different interests, not by their difference\r\nof size, but by other circumstances; the most material of which\r\nresulted partly from climate, but principally from the effects of\r\ntheir having or not having slaves. These two causes concurred in\r\nforming the great division of interests in the United States. It did\r\nnot lie between the large and small States. IT LAY BETWEEN THE\r\nNORTHERN AND SOUTHERN; and if any defensive power were necessary, it\r\nought to be mutually given to these two interests. He was so strongly\r\nimpressed with this important truth, that he had been casting about in\r\nhis mind for some expedient that would answer the purpose. The one\r\nwhich had occurred was, that, instead of proportioning the votes of\r\nthe States in both branches, to the irrespective numbers of\r\ninhabitants, computing the slaves in the ratio of five to three, they\r\nshould be represented in one branch according to the number of free\r\ninhabitants only; and in the other according to the whole number,\r\ncounting slaves as free. By this arrangement the Southern scale would\r\nhave the advantage in one House, and the Northern in the other. He had\r\nbeen restrained from proposing this expedient by two considerations;\r\none was his unwillingness to urge any diversity of interests on an\r\noccasion where it is but too apt to arise of itself; the other was the\r\ninequality of powers that must be vested in the two branches, and\r\nwhich would destroy the equilibrium of interests.--_pp_. 1006-7\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. PINCKNEY. There is a real distinction between the Northern and\r\nSouthern interests. North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, in\r\ntheir rice and indigo, had a peculiar interest which might be\r\nsacrificed.--_p_. 1016.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, July 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. PINCKNEY--thought the blacks ought to stand on an equality with\r\nthe whites; but would agree to the ratio settled by Congress.--_p._\r\n1039.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY, July 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. PATTERSON considered the proposed estimate for the future\r\naccording to the combined rules of numbers and wealth, as too vague.\r\nFor this reason New Jersey was against it. He could regard negro\r\nslaves in no light but as property. They are no free agents, have no\r\npersonal liberty, no faculty of acquiring property, but on the\r\ncontrary are themselves property, and like other property entirely at\r\nthe will of the master. Has a man in Virginia a number of votes in\r\nproportion to the number of his slaves? And if negroes are not\r\nrepresented in the States to which they belong, why should they be\r\nrepresented in the General Government. What is the true principle of\r\nrepresentation? It is an expedient by which an assembly of certain\r\nindividuals, chosen by the people, is substituted in place of the\r\ninconvenient meeting of the people themselves. If such a meeting of\r\nthe people was actually to take place, would the slaves vote? They\r\nwould not. Why then should they be represented? He was also against\r\nsuch an indirect encouragement of the slave trade; observing that\r\nCongress, in their act relating to the change of the eighth article of\r\nConfederation, had been ashamed to use the term \"slaves,\" and had\r\nsubstituted a description.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON reminded Mr. PATTERSON that his doctrine of\r\nrepresentation, which was in its principle the genuine one, must for\r\never silence the pretensions of the small States to an equality of\r\nvotes with the large ones. They ought to vote in the same proportion\r\nin which their citizens would do, if the people of all the States were\r\ncollectively met. He suggested, as a proper ground of compromise, that\r\nin the first branch the States should be represented according to\r\ntheir number of free inhabitants; and in the second, which had for one\r\nof its primary objects the guardianship of property, according to the\r\nwhole number, including slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER urged warmly the justice and necessity of regarding wealth\r\nin the apportionment of representation.\r\n\r\nMr. KING had always expected, that, as the Southern States are the\r\nrichest, they would not league themselves with the Northern, unless\r\nsome respect were paid to their superior wealth. If the latter expect\r\nthose preferential distinctions in commerce, and other advantages\r\nwhich they will derive from the connexion, they must not expect to\r\nreceive them without allowing some advantages in return. Eleven out of\r\nthirteen of the States had agreed to consider slaves in the\r\napportionment of taxation; and taxation and representation ought to go\r\ntogether.--_pp_. 1054-5-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, July 10, 1787.\r\n\r\n_In Convention_,--Mr. KING reported, from the Committee yesterday\r\nappointed, \"that the States at the first meeting of the General\r\nLegislature, should be represented by sixty-five members, in the\r\nfollowing proportions, to wit:--New Hampshire, by 3; Massachusetts, 8;\r\nRhode Island, 1; Connecticut, 5; New York, 6; New Jersey, 4;\r\nPennsylvania, 8; Delaware, 1; Maryland, 6; Virginia, 10; North\r\nCarolina, 5; South Carolina, 5; Georgia, 3.\"\r\n\r\nMr. KING remarked that the four Eastern States, having 800,000 souls,\r\nhave one-third fewer representatives than the four Southern States,\r\nhaving not more than 700,000 souls, rating the blacks as five for\r\nthree. The Eastern people will advert to these circumstances, and be\r\ndissatisfied. He believed them to be very desirous of uniting with\r\ntheir Southern brethren, but did not think it prudent to rely so far\r\non that disposition, as to subject them to any gross inequality. He\r\nwas fully convinced that THE QUESTION CONCERNING A DIFFERENCE OF\r\nINTERESTS DID NOT LIE WHERE IT HAD HITHERTO BEEN DISCUSSED, BETWEEN\r\nTHE GREAT AND SMALL STATES; BUT BETWEEN THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN. For\r\nthis reason be had been ready to yield something, in the proportion of\r\nrepresentatives, for the security of the Southern. No principle would\r\njustify the giving them a majority. They were brought as near an\r\nequality as was possible. He was not averse to giving them a still\r\ngreater security, but did not see how it could be done.\r\n\r\nGeneral PINCKNEY. The Report before it was committed was more favorable\r\nto the Southern States than as it now stands. If they are to form so\r\nconsiderable a minority, and the regulation of trade is to be given to\r\nthe General Government, they will be nothing more than overseers for\r\nthe Northern States. He did not expect the Southern States to be\r\nraised to a majority of representatives; but wished them to have\r\nsomething like an equality.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAMSON. The Southern interest must be extremely endangered by\r\nthe present arrangement. The Northern States are to have a majority in\r\nthe first instance, and the means of perpetuating it.\r\n\r\nGeneral PINCKNEY urged the reduction; dwelt on the superior wealth of\r\nthe Southern States, and insisted on its having its due weight in the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS regretted the turn of the debate. The States, he\r\nfound, had many representatives on the floor. Few, he feared, were to\r\nbe deemed the representatives of America. He thought the Southern\r\nStates have, by the Report, more than their share of Representation.\r\nProperty ought to have its weight, but not all the weight. If the\r\nSouthern States are to supply money, the Northern States are to spill\r\ntheir blood. Besides, the probable revenue to be expected from the\r\nSouthern States has been greatly overrated.--_pp_. 1056-7-8-9.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, July 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAMSON moved that Mr. RANDOLPH's propositions be postponed, in\r\norder to consider the following, \"that in order to ascertain the\r\nalterations that may happen in the population and wealth of the\r\nseveral States, a census shall be taken of the free white inhabitants,\r\nand three-fifths of those of other descriptions on the first year\r\nafter this government shall have been adopted, and every ---- year\r\nthereafter; and that the representation be regulated accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER and General PINCKNEY insisted that blacks be included in the\r\nrule of representation _equally_ with the whites; and for that purpose\r\nmoved that the words \"three-fifths\" be struck out.\r\n\r\nMr. GERRY thought that three-fifths of them was, to say the least, the\r\nfull proportion that could be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. GORHAM. This ratio was fixed by Congress as a rule of taxation.\r\nThen, it was urged, by the Delegates representing the States having\r\nslaves, that the blacks were still more inferior to freemen. At\r\npresent, when the ratio of representation is to be established, we are\r\nassured that they are equal to freemen. The arguments on the former\r\noccasion had convinced him, that three-fifths was pretty near the just\r\nproportion, and he should vote according to the same opinion now.\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER insisted that the labor of a slave in South Carolina was as\r\nproductive and valuable, as that of a freeman in Massachusetts; that\r\nas wealth was the great means of defence and utility to the nation,\r\nthey were equally valuable to it with freemen; and that consequently\r\nan equal representation ought to be allowed for them in a government\r\nwhich was instituted principally, for the protection of property, and\r\nwas itself to be supported by property.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON could not agree to the motion, notwithstanding it was\r\nfavorable to Virginia, because he thought it unjust. It was certain\r\nthat the slaves were valuable, as they raised the value of land,\r\nincreased the exports and imports, and of course the revenue, would\r\nsupply the means of feeding and supporting an army, and might in cases\r\nof emergency become themselves soldiers. As in these important\r\nrespects they were useful to the community at large, they ought not to\r\nbe excluded from the estimate of representation. He could not,\r\nhowever, regard them as equal to freemen, and could not vote for them\r\nas such. He added, as worthy of remark, that the Southern States have\r\nthis peculiar species of property, over and above the other species of\r\nproperty common to all the States.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAMSON reminded Mr. GORHAM that if the Southern States\r\ncontended for the inferiority of blacks to whites when taxation was in\r\nview, the Eastern States, on the same occasion, contended for their\r\nequality. He did not, however, either then or now, concur in either\r\nextreme, but approved of the ratio of three-fifths.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. BUTLER'S motion, for considering blacks as equal to whites in\r\nthe apportionment of representation,--Delaware, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, aye--3; Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, no--7; New York, not on the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS said he had several objections to the\r\nproposition of Mr. WILLIAMSON. In the first place, it fettered the\r\nLegislature too much. In the second place, it would exclude some\r\nStates altogether who would not have a sufficient number to entitle\r\nthem to a single representation. In the third place, it will not\r\nconsist with the resolution passed on Saturday last, authorizing the\r\nLegislature to adjust the representation from time to time on the\r\nprinciples of population and wealth; nor with the principles of\r\nequity. If slaves were to be considered as inhabitants, not as wealth,\r\nthen the said Resolution would not be pursued; if as wealth, then why\r\nis no other wealth but slaves included? These objections may perhaps\r\nbe removed by amendments.\r\n\r\nMr. KING thought there was great force in the objections of Mr.\r\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS. He would, however, accede to the proposition for\r\nthe sake of doing something.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. Another objection with him, against admitting\r\nthe blacks into the census, was, that the people of Pennsylvania would\r\nrevolt at the idea of being put on a footing with slaves. They would\r\nreject any plan that was to have such an effect.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. Future contributions, it seemed to be understood on all\r\nhands, would be principally levied on imports and exports.--pp.\r\n1066-7-8-9; 1070-2-3.\r\n\r\nOn the question on the first clause of Mr. WILLIAMSON's motion, as to\r\ntaking a census of the _free_ inhabitants, it passed in the\r\naffirmative,--Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, aye--6; Delaware, Maryland, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, no--4.\r\n\r\nThe next clause as to three-fifths of the negroes being considered,\r\n\r\nMr. KING, being much opposed to fixing numbers as the rule of\r\nrepresentation, was particularly so on account of the blacks. He\r\nthought the admission of them along with whites at all, would excite\r\ngreat discontents among the States having no slaves. He had never\r\nsaid, as to any particular point, that he would in no event acquiesce\r\nin and support it; but he would say that if in any case such a\r\ndeclaration was to be made by him, it would be in this.\r\n\r\nHe remarked that in the temporary allotment of representatives made by\r\nthe Committee, the Southern States had received more than the number\r\nof their white and three-fifths of their black inhabitants entitled\r\nthem to.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN. South Carolina had not more beyond her proportion than\r\nNew York and New Hampshire; nor either of them more than was necessary\r\nin order to avoid fractions, or reducing them below their proportion.\r\nGeorgia had more; but the rapid growth of that State seemed to justify\r\nit. In general the allotment might not be just, but considering all\r\ncircumstances he was satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nMr. GORHAM was aware that there might be some weight in what had\r\nfallen from his colleague, as to the umbrage which might be taken by\r\nthe people of the Eastern States. But he recollected that when the\r\nproposition of Congress for changing the eighth Article of the\r\nConfederation was before the Legislature of Massachusetts, the only\r\ndifficulty then was, to satisfy them that the negroes ought not to\r\nhave been counted equally with the whites, instead of being counted in\r\nthe ratio of three-fifths only.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: They were then to have been a rule of taxation only.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON did not well see, on what principle the admission of blacks\r\nin the proportion of three-fifths could be explained. Are they\r\nadmitted as citizens--then why are they not admitted on an equality\r\nwith white citizens? Are they admitted as property--then why is not\r\nother property admitted into the computation? These were difficulties,\r\nhowever, which he thought must be overruled by the necessity of\r\ncompromise. He had some apprehensions also, from the tendency of the\r\nblending of the blacks with the whites, to give disgust to the people\r\nof Pennsylvania, as had been intimated by his colleague (Mr.\r\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS.)\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS was compelled to declare himself reduced to the\r\ndilemma of doing injustice to the Southern States, or to human nature;\r\nand he must therefore do it to the former. For he could never agree to\r\ngive such encouragement to the slave trade, as would be given by\r\nallowing them a representation for their negroes; and he did not\r\nbelieve those States would ever confederate on terms that would\r\ndeprive them of that trade.\r\n\r\nOn the question for agreeing to include three-fifths of the\r\nblacks,--Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, aye--4;\r\nMassachusetts, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,[2] South\r\nCarolina, no--6.--_pp_.1076-7-8.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Carroll said, in explanation of the vote of Maryland,\r\nthat he wished the _phraseology_ to be so altered as to obviate, if\r\npossible, the danger which had been expressed of giving umbrage to the\r\nEastern and Middle States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, July 12, 1787.\r\n\r\n_In Convention_,--Mr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS moved a proviso, \"that\r\ntaxation shall be in proportion to representation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER contended again, that representation should be according to\r\nthe full number of inhabitants, including all the blacks; admitting\r\nthe justice of Mr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS'S motion.\r\n\r\nGeneral PINCKNEY was alarmed at what was said yesterday, [by\r\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS] concerning the negroes. He was now again alarmed at\r\nwhat had been thrown out concerning the taxing of exports. South\r\nCarolina has in one year exported to the amount of 600,000£. sterling,\r\nall which was the fruit of the labor of her blacks. Will she be\r\nrepresented in proportion to this amount? She will not. Neither ought\r\nshe then to be subject to a tax on it. He hoped a clause would be\r\ninserted in the system, restraining the Legislature from taxing\r\nexports.\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON approved the principle, but could not see how it could be\r\ncarried into execution; unless restrained to direct taxation.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS having so varied his motion by inserting the\r\nword \"direct,\" it passed, _nem. con_., as follows: \"provided always\r\nthat direct taxation ought to be proportioned to representation\"\r\n\r\nMr. DAVIE said it was high time now to speak out. He saw that it was\r\nmeant by some gentlemen to deprive the Southern States of any share of\r\nrepresentation for their blacks. He was sure that North Carolina would\r\nnever confederate on any terms that did not rate them at least as\r\nthree-fifths. If the Eastern States meant, therefore, to exclude them\r\naltogether, the business was at an end.\r\n\r\nDr. JOHNSON thought that wealth and population were the true,\r\nequitable rules of representation; but he conceived that these two\r\nprinciples resolved themselves into one, population being the best\r\nmeasure of wealth. He concluded, therefore, that the number of people\r\nought to be established as the rule, and that all descriptions,\r\nincluding blacks _equally_ with the whites, ought to fall within the\r\ncomputation. As various opinions had been expressed on the subject, he\r\nwould move that a committee might be appointed to take them into\r\nconsideration, and report them.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVENEUR MORRIS. It had been said that it is high time to speak\r\nout. As one member, he would candidly do so. He came here to form a\r\ncompact for the good of America. He was ready to do so with all the\r\nStates. He hoped, and believed, that all would enter into such\r\ncompact. If they would not, he was ready to join with any states that\r\nwould. But as the compact was to be voluntary, it is in vain for the\r\nEastern States to insist on what the Southern States will never agree\r\nto. It is equally vain for the latter to require, what the other\r\nStates can never admit; and he verily believed the people of\r\nPennsylvania will never agree to a representation of negroes. What can\r\nbe desired by these States more than has been already proposed--that\r\nthe legislature shall from time to time regulate representation\r\naccording to population and wealth?\r\n\r\nGeneral PINCKNEY desired that the rule of wealth should be\r\nascertained, and not left to the pleasure of the legislature, and that\r\nproperty in slaves should not be exposed to danger, under a government\r\ninstituted for the protection of property.\r\n\r\nThe first clause in the Report of the first Grand Committee was\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nMr. ELLSWORTH, in order to carry into effect the principle\r\nestablished, moved to add to the last clause adopted by the house the\r\nwords following, \"and that the rule of contribution by direct\r\ntaxation, for the support of the Government of the United States,\r\nshall be the number of white inhabitants, and three-fifths of every\r\nother description in the several States, until some other rule that\r\nshall more accurately ascertain the wealth of the several States, can\r\nbe devised and adopted by the Legislature.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER seconded the motion, in order that it might be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH was not satisfied with the motion. The danger will be\r\nrevived, that the ingenuity of the Legislature may evade or pervert\r\nthe rule, so as to perpetuate the power where it shall be lodged in\r\nthe first instance. He proposed, in lieu of Mr. ELLSWORTH'S motion\r\n\"that in order to ascertain the alterations in representation that\r\nstay be required, from time to time, by changes in the relative\r\ncircumstances of the States, a census shall be taken within two years\r\nfrom the first meeting of the General Legislature of the United\r\nStates, and once within the term of every ---- years afterwards, of\r\nall the inhabitants, in the manner and according to the ratio\r\nrecommended by Congress in their Resolution of the eighteenth day of\r\nApril, 1783, (rating the blacks at three-fifths of their number); and\r\nthat the Legislature of the United States shall arrange the\r\nrepresentation accordingly.\" He urged strenuously that express\r\nsecurity ought to be presided for including slaves in the ratio of\r\nrepresentation. He lamented that such a species of property existed.\r\nBut as it did exist, the holders of it would require this security.\r\nIt was perceived that the design was entertained by some of excluding\r\nslaves altogether; the Legislature therefore ought not to be left at\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nMr. ELLSWORTH withdraws his motion, and seconds that of Mr. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON observed, that less umbrage would perhaps be taken against\r\nan admission of the slaves into the rule of representation, if it\r\nshould be so expressed as to make them indirectly only an ingredient\r\nin the rule, by saying that they should enter into the rule of\r\ntaxation; and as representation was to be according to taxation, the\r\nend would be equally attained.\r\n\r\nMr. PINCKNEY moved to amend Mr. RANDOLPH'S motion, so as to make\r\n\"blacks equal to the whites in the ratio of representation.\" This,\r\nhe urged was nothing more than justice. The blacks are the laborers,\r\nthe peasants, of the Southern States. They are as productive of\r\npecuniary resources as those of the Northern States. They add equally\r\nto the wealth, and, considering money as the sinew of war, to the\r\nstrength, of the nation. It will also be politic with regard to the\r\nNorthern States, as taxation is to keep pace with representation.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. PINCKNEY'S (of S. Carolina) motion, for rating blacks as equal\r\nto whites, instead of as three-fifths,--South Carolina, Georgia,\r\naye--2; Massachusetts, Connecticut (Doctor JOHNSON, aye), New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania (three against two), Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, no--8.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH'S (of Virginia) proposition, as varied by Mr. WILSON (of\r\nPennsylvania) being read for taking the question on the whole,--\r\n\r\nMr. GERRY (of Massachusetts) urged that the principle of it could not\r\nbe carried into execution, as the States were not to be taxed as\r\nStates. With regard to taxes on imposts, he conceived they would be\r\nmore productive where there were no slaves, than where there were; the\r\nconsumption being greater.\r\n\r\nMr. ELLSWORTH (of Connecticut). In the case of a poll-tax there would\r\nbe no difficulty. But there would probably be none. The sum allotted\r\nto a State may be levied without difficulty, according to the plan\r\nused by the State in raising its own supplies.\r\n\r\nOn the question on the whole proposition, as proportioning\r\nrepresentation to direct taxation, and both to the white and\r\nthree-fifths of the black inhabitants, and requiring a census within\r\nsix years, and within every ten years afterwards,--Connecticut,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, aye--6; New\r\nJersey, Delaware, no--2; Massachusetts, South Carolina,\r\ndivided.--pp. 1079 to 1087.\r\n\r\nFriday, July 13, 1787. Mr. MADISON said, that having always conceived\r\nthat the difference of interest in the United States lay not between\r\nthe large and small, but the Northern and Southern States.-p. 1088.\r\n\r\nOn the motion of Mr. RANDOLPH (of Virginia) the vote of Monday last,\r\nauthorizing the Legislature to adjust, from time to time, the\r\nrepresentation upon the principles of _wealth_ and numbers of\r\ninhabitants, was reconsidered by common consent, in order to strike\r\nout _wealth_ and adjust the resolution to that requiring periodical\r\nrevisions according to the number of whites and three-fifths of the\r\nblacks.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS (of Pennsylvania) opposed the alteration, as\r\nleaving still an incoherence. If negroes were to be viewed as\r\ninhabitants, and the revision was to proceed on the principle of\r\nnumbers of inhabitants, they ought to be added in their entire number,\r\nand not in the proportion of three-fifths. If as property, the word\r\nwealth was right; and striking it out would produce the very\r\ninconsistency which it was meant to get rid of. The train of business,\r\nand the late turn which it had taken, had led him, he said, into deep\r\nmeditation on it, and he would candidly state the result. A\r\ndistinction had been set up, and urged, between the Northern and\r\nSouthern States. He had hitherto considered this doctrine as\r\nheretical. He still thought the distinction groundless. He sees,\r\nhowever, that it is persisted in; and the Southern gentlemen will not\r\nbe satisfied unless they see the way open to their gaining a majority\r\nin the public councils. The consequence of such a transfer of power\r\nfrom the maritime to the interior and landed interest, will, he\r\nforesees, be such an oppression to commerce, that he shall be obliged\r\nto vote for the vicious principle of equality in the second branch, in\r\norder to provide some defence for the Northern States against it. But\r\nto come more to the point, either this distinction is fictitious or\r\nreal; if fictitious, let it be dismissed, and let us proceed with due\r\nconfidence. If it be real, instead of attempting to blend incompatible\r\nthings, let us at once take a friendly leave of each other. There can\r\nbe no end of demands for security, if every particular interest is to\r\nbe entitled to it. The Eastern States may claim it for their fishery,\r\nand for other objects, as the Southern States claim it for their\r\npeculiar objects. In this struggle between the two ends of the Union,\r\nwhat part ought the Middle States, in point of policy, to take? To\r\njoin their Eastern brethren, according to his ideas. If the Southern\r\nStates get the power into their hands, and be joined, as they will be,\r\nwith the interior country, they will inevitably bring on a war with\r\nSpain for the Mississippi. This language is already held. The interior\r\ncountry, having no property nor interest exposed on the sea, will be\r\nlittle affected by such a war. He wished to know what security the\r\nNorthern and Middle States will have against this danger. It has been\r\nsaid that North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia only, will in a\r\nlittle time have a majority of the people of America. They must in\r\nthat case include the great interior country, and every thing was to\r\nbe apprehended from their getting the power into their hands.\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER (of South Carolina). The security the Southern States want\r\nis, that their negroes may not be taken from them, which some\r\ngentlemen within or without doors have a very good mind to do. It was\r\nnot supposed that North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, would\r\nhave more people than all the other States, but many more relatively\r\nto the other States, than they now have. The people and strength of\r\nAmerica are evidently bearing southwardly, and southwestwardly.\r\n\r\nOn the question to strike out _wealth_, and to make the change\r\nas moved by Mr. RANDOLPH (of Virginia) it passed in the\r\naffirmative,--Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, aye--9;\r\nDelaware, divided.--_pp_. 1090-1-2-3-4.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, July 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. It seemed now to be pretty well understood, that the real\r\ndifference of interests lay, not between the large and small, but\r\nbetween the Northern and Southern, States. THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY,\r\nAND IT'S CONSEQUENCES, FORMED THE LINE OF DISCRIMINATION.--_p_. 1104.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, July 17, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAMSON. The largest State will be sure to succeed. This will\r\nnot be Virginia, however. Her slaves will have no suffrage.--_p_.\r\n1123.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, July 19, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the\r\nNorthern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no\r\ninfluence in the election, on the score of the negroes.--p. 1148.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY, July 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nGeneral PINCKNEY reminded the Convention, that if the Committee should\r\nfail to insert some security to the Southern States against an\r\nemancipation of slaves, and taxes on exports, he should be bound by\r\nduty to his State to vote against their report.--_p_. 1187.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, July 24, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAMSON. As the Executive is to have a kind of veto on the\r\nlaws, and there is an essential difference of interests between the\r\nNorthern and Southern States, particularly in the carrying trade, the\r\npower will be dangerous, if the Executive is to be taken from part of\r\nthe Union, to the part from which he is not taken.--_p_. 1189.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS hoped the Committee would strike out the whole\r\nof the clause proportioning direct taxation to representation. He had\r\nonly meant it as a bridge[3] to assist us over a certain gulf; having\r\npassed the gulf, the bridge may be removed. He thought the principle\r\nlaid down with so much strictness liable to strong objections.--_p_.\r\n1197.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The object was to lessen the eagerness, on one side, for,\r\nand the opposition, on the other, to the share of representation\r\nclaimed by the Southern States on account of the negroes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, July 25, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. Refer the appointment of the National Executive to the\r\nState Legislatures, and * * *\r\n\r\nThe remaining mode was an election by the people, or rather by the\r\nqualified part of them at large. * * *\r\n\r\nThe second difficulty arose from the disproportion of qualified voters\r\nin the Northern and Southern States, and the disadvantages which this\r\nmode would throw on the latter. The answer to this objection was--in\r\nthe first place, that this disproportion would be continually\r\ndecreasing under the influence of the republican laws introduced in\r\nthe Southern States, and the more rapid increase of their population;\r\nin the second place, that local considerations must give way to the\r\ngeneral interest. As an individual from the Southern States, he was\r\nwilling to make the sacrifice.--pp. 1200-1.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, July 26, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur Morris. Revenue will be drawn, it is foreseen, as much\r\nas possible from trade.--p. 1217.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, August 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Rutledge delivered in the Report of the Committee of Detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.\r\n\r\nSECT. 3. The proportions of direct taxation shall be regulated by the\r\nwhole number of white and other free citizens and inhabitants of every\r\nage, sex and condition, including those bound to servitude for a term\r\nof years, and three-fifths of all other persons not comprehended in\r\nthe foregoing description, (except Indians not paying taxes); which\r\nnumber shall, within six years after the first meeting of the\r\nLegislature, and within the term of every ten years afterwards, be\r\ntaken in such a manner as the said Legislature shall direct.\r\n\r\nSECT. 4. No tax or duty shall be laid by the Legislature on articles\r\nexported from any State; nor on the migration or importation of such\r\npersons as the several States shall think proper to admit; nor shall\r\nsuch migration or importation be prohibited.\r\n\r\nSECT. 5. No capitation tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the\r\ncensus herein before directed to be taken.\r\n\r\nSECT. 6. No navigation act shall be passed without the assent of\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present in each house.--pp. 1226-33-34.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, August 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. King wished to know what influence the vote just passed was meant\r\nto have on the succeeding part of the Report, concerning the admission\r\nof slaves into the rule of representation. He could not reconcile his\r\nmind to the Article, if it was to prevent objections to the latter\r\npart. The admission of slaves was a most grating circumstance to his\r\nmind, and he believed would be so to a great part of the people of\r\nAmerica. He had not made a strenuous opposition to it heretofore,\r\nbecause he had hoped that this concession would have produced a\r\nreadiness, which had not been manifested, to strengthen the General\r\nGovernment, and to mark a full confidence in it. The Report under\r\nconsideration had, by the tenor of it, put an end to all those hopes.\r\nIn two great points the hands of the Legislature were absolutely tied.\r\nThe importation of slaves could not be prohibited. Exports could not\r\nbe taxed. Is this reasonable? What are the great objects of the\r\ngeneral system? First, defence against foreign invasion; secondly,\r\nagainst internal sedition. Shall all the States, then, be bound to\r\ndefend each, and shall each be at liberty to introduce a weakness\r\nwhich will render defence more difficult? Shall one part of the United\r\nStates be bound to defend another part, and that other part be at\r\nliberty, not only to increase its own danger, but to withhold the\r\ncompensation for the burden? If slaves are to be imported, shall not\r\nthe exports produced by their labor supply a revenue the better to\r\nenable the General Government to defend their masters? There was so\r\nmuch inequality and unreasonableness in all this, that the people of\r\nthe Northern States could never be reconciled to it. No candid man\r\ncould undertake to justify it to them. He had hoped that some\r\naccommodation would have taken place on this subject; that at least a\r\ntime would have been limited for the importation of slaves. He never\r\ncould agree to let them be imported without limitation, and then be\r\nrepresented in the National Legislature. Indeed, he could so little\r\npersuade himself of the rectitude of such a practice, that he was not\r\nsure be could assent to it under any circumstances. At all events,\r\neither slaves should not be represented, or exports should be taxable.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN regarded the slave trade as iniquitous; but the point of\r\nrepresentation having been settled after much difficulty and\r\ndeliberation, he did not think himself bound to make opposition;\r\nespecially as the present Article, as amended, did not preclude any\r\narrangement whatever on that point, in another place of the report.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS moved to insert \"free\" before the word\r\n\"inhabitants.\" Much, he said, would depend on this point. He never\r\nwould concur in upholding domestic slavery. It was a nefarious\r\ninstitution. It was the curse of Heaven on the States where it\r\nprevailed. Compare the free regions of the Middle States, where a rich\r\nand noble cultivation marks the prosperity and happiness of the\r\npeople, with the misery and poverty which overspread the barren wastes\r\nof Virginia, Maryland, and the other States having slaves. Travel\r\nthrough the whole continent, and you behold the prospect continually\r\nvarying with the appearance and disappearance of slavery. The moment\r\nyou leave the Eastern States, and enter New York, the effects of the\r\ninstitution become visible. Passing through the Jerseys and entering\r\nPennsylvania, every criterion of superior improvement witnesses the\r\nchange. Proceed southwardly, and every step you take, through the\r\ngreat regions of slaves, presents a desert increasing with the\r\nincreasing proportion of these wretched beings. Upon what principle is\r\nit that the slaves shall be computed in the representation? Are they\r\nmen? Then make them citizens, and let them vote. Are they property?\r\nWhy, then, is no other property included? The houses in this city\r\n(Philadelphia) are worth more than all the wretched slaves who cover\r\nthe rice swamps of South Carolina. The admission of slaves into the\r\nrepresentation, when fairly explained, comes to this, that the\r\ninhabitant of Georgia and South Carolina who goes to the coast of\r\nAfrica, and, in defiance of the most sacred laws of humanity, tears\r\naway his fellow creatures from their dearest connections, and damns\r\nthem to the most cruel bondage, shall have more votes in a government\r\ninstituted for protection of the rights of mankind, than the citizen\r\nof Pennsylvania or New Jersey, who views with a laudable horror so\r\nnefarious a practice. He would add, that domestic slavery is the most\r\nprominent feature in the aristocratic countenance of the proposed\r\nConstitution. The vassalage of the poor has ever been the favorite\r\noffspring of aristocracy. And what is the proposed compensation to the\r\nNorthern States, for a sacrifice of every principle of right, of every\r\nimpulse of humanity? They are to bind themselves to march their\r\nmilitia for the defence of the Southern States, for their defence\r\nagainst those very slaves of whom they complain. They must supply\r\nvessels and seamen, in case of foreign attack. The Legislature will\r\nhave indefinite power to tax them by excises, and duties on imports;\r\nboth of which will fall heavier on them than on the Southern\r\ninhabitants; for the bohea tea used by a Northern freeman will pay\r\nmore tax than the whole consumption of the miserable slave, which\r\nconsists of nothing more than his physical subsistence and the rag\r\nthat covers his nakedness. On the other side, the Southern States are\r\nnot to be restrained from importing fresh supplies of wretched\r\nAfricans, at once to increase the danger of attack, and the difficulty\r\nof defence; nay, they are to be encouraged to it, by an assurance of\r\nhaving their votes in the National Government increased in proportion;\r\nand are, at the same time, to have their exports and their slaves\r\nexempt from all contributions for the public service. Let it not be\r\nsaid, that direct taxation is to be proportioned to representation. It\r\nis idle to suppose that the General Government can stretch its hand\r\ndirectly into the pockets of the people, scattered over so vast a\r\ncountry. They can only do it through the medium of exports, imports\r\nand excises. For what, then, are all the sacrifices to be made? He\r\nwould sooner submit himself to a tax for paying for all the negroes in\r\nthe United States, than saddle posterity with such a Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. DAYTON seconded the motion. He did it, he said, that his\r\nsentiments on the subject might appear, whatever might be the fate of\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN did not regard the admission of the negroes into the ratio\r\nof representation, as liable to such insuperable objections. It was\r\nthe freemen of the Southern States who were, in fact, to be\r\nrepresented according to the taxes paid by them, and the negroes are\r\nonly included in the estimate of the taxes. This was his idea of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nMr. PINCKNEY considered the fisheries, and the western frontier, as\r\nmore burdensome to the United States than the slaves. He thought this\r\ncould be demonstrated, if the occasion were a proper one.\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON thought the motion premature. An agreement to the clause\r\nwould be no bar to the object of it.\r\n\r\nOn the question, on the motion to insert \"free\" before \"inhabitants,\"\r\nNew-Jersey, aye--1; New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, Georgia, no--10.--pp. 1261-2-3-4-5-6.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, August 16, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON urged the necessity of connecting with the powers of levying\r\ntaxes, duties, &c., the prohibition in Article 6, Sect. 4, \"that no\r\ntax should be laid on exports.\"\r\n\r\nHe hoped the Northern States did not mean to deny the Southern this\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nMR. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS considered such a proviso as inadmissible\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nMR. MADISON. Fourthly, the Southern States, being most in danger and\r\nmost needing naval protection, could the less complain, if the burthen\r\nshould be somewhat heaviest on them. And finally, we are not providing\r\nfor the present moment only; and time will equalize the situation of\r\nthe States in this matter. He was, for these reasons, against the\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nMR. MERCER. It had been said the Southern States had most need of\r\nnaval protection. The reverse was the case. Were it not for promoting\r\nthe carrying trade of the Northern States, the Southern States could\r\nlet the trade go into foreign bottoms, where it would not need our\r\nprotection.--pp. 1339-40-41-42.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, August 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticles 7, Section 3, was then resumed.\r\n\r\nMR. DICKINSON moved to postpone this, in order to reconsider Article\r\n4, Section 4, and to _limit_ the number of Representatives to be\r\nallowed to the large States. Unless this were done, the small States\r\nwould be reduced to entire insignificance, and encouragement given to\r\nthe importation of slaves.\r\n\r\nMR. SHERMAN would agree to such a reconsideration; but did not see the\r\nnecessity of postponing the section before the House. MR. DICKINSON\r\nwithdrew his motion.\r\n\r\nArticle 7, Section 3, was then agreed to,--ten ayes; Delaware alone,\r\nno.--p. 1379.\r\n\r\nArticle 7, Section 4, was then taken up.\r\n\r\nMR. LANGDON. By this section the States are left at liberty to tax\r\nexports. This could not be admitted. It seems to be feared that the\r\nNorthern States will oppress the trade of the Southern. This may be\r\nguarded against, by requiring the concurrence of two-thirds, or\r\nthree-fourths of the Legislature, in such cases.--p. 1382-3.\r\n\r\nMR. MADISON. As to the fear of disproportionate burthens on the more\r\nexporting States, it might be remarked that it was agreed, on all\r\nhands, that the revenue would principally be drawn from trade.--p.\r\n1385.\r\n\r\nCOL. MASON--A majority, when interested, will oppress the minority.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the States in this point of view, the eight Northern\r\nStates have an interest different from the five Southern States; and\r\nhave, in one branch of the Legislature, thirty-six votes, against\r\ntwenty-nine, and in the other in the proportion of eight against five.\r\nThe Southern States had therefore ground for their suspicions. The\r\ncase of exports was not the same with that of imports.--pp. 1386-7.\r\n\r\nMR. L. MARTIN proposed to vary Article 7, Section 4, so as to allow a\r\nprohibition or tax on the importation of slaves. In the first place,\r\nas five slaves are to be counted as three freemen, in the\r\napportionment of Representatives, such a clause would leave an\r\nencouragement to this traffic. In the second place, slaves weakened\r\none part of the Union, which the other parts were bound to protect;\r\nthe privilege of importing them was therefore unreasonable. And in the\r\nthird place, it was inconsistent with the principles of the\r\nRevolution, and dishonorable to the American character, to have such a\r\nfeature in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. RUTLEDGE did not see how the importation of slaves could be\r\nencouraged by this section. He was not apprehensive of insurrections,\r\nand would readily exempt the other States from the obligation to\r\nprotect the Southern against them. Religion and humanity had nothing\r\nto do with this question. Interest alone is the governing principle\r\nwith nations. The true question at present is, whether the Southern\r\nStates shall or shall not be parties to the Union. If the Northern\r\nStates consult their interest, they will not oppose the increase of\r\nslaves, which will increase the commodities of which they will become\r\nthe carriers.\r\n\r\nMr. ELLSWORTH was for leaving the clause as it stands. Let every State\r\nimport what it pleases. The morality or wisdom of slavery are\r\nconsiderations belonging to the States themselves. What enriches a\r\npart enriches the whole, and the States are the best judges of their\r\nparticular interest. The Old Confederation had not meddled with this\r\npoint; and he did not see any greater necessity for bringing it within\r\nthe policy of the new one.\r\n\r\nMr. PINCKNEY. South Carolina can never receive the plan if it\r\nprohibits the slave trade. In every proposed extension of the powers\r\nof Congress, that State has expressly and watchfully excepted that of\r\nmeddling with the importation of negroes. If the States be all left at\r\nliberty on this subject, South Carolina may perhaps, by degrees, do of\r\nherself what is wished, as Virginia and Maryland already have done.\r\nAdjourned.--_pp_. 1388-9.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, August 22, 1787.\r\n\r\n_In Convention_,--Article 7, Section 4, was resumed.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN was for leaving the clause as it stands. He disapproved of\r\nthe slave trade; yet as the States were now possessed of the right to\r\nimport slaves, as the public good did not require it to be taken from\r\nthem, and as it was expedient to have as few objections as possible to\r\nthe proposed scheme of government, he thought it best to leave the\r\nmatter as we find it. He observed that the abolition of slavery seemed\r\nto be going on in the United States, and that the good sense of the\r\nseveral States would probably by degrees complete it. He urged on the\r\nConvention the necessity of despatching its business.\r\n\r\nCol. MASON. This infernal traffic originated in the avarice of British\r\nmerchants. The British Government constantly checked the attempts of\r\nVirginia to put a stop to it. The present question concerns not the\r\nimporting States alone, but the whole Union. The evil of having slaves\r\nwas experienced during the late war. Had slaves been treated as they\r\nmight have been by the enemy, they would have proved dangerous\r\ninstruments in their hands. But their folly dealt by the slaves as it\r\ndid by the tories. He mentioned the dangerous insurrections of the\r\nslaves in Greece and Sicily; and the instructions given by Cromwell to\r\nthe commissioners sent to Virginia, to arm the servants and slaves, in\r\ncase other means of obtaining its submission should fail. Maryland and\r\nVirginia he said had already prohibited the importation of slaves\r\nexpressly. North Carolina had done the same in substance. All this\r\nwould be in vain, if South Carolina and Georgia be at liberty to\r\nimport. The Western people are already calling out for slaves for\r\ntheir new lands; and will fill that country with slaves, if they can\r\nbe got through South Carolina and Georgia. Slavery discourages arts\r\nand manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed by slaves.\r\nThey prevent the emigration of whites, who really enrich and\r\nstrengthen a country. They produce the most pernicious effect on\r\nmanners. Every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant. They bring the\r\njudgment of Heaven on a country. As nations cannot be rewarded or\r\npunished in the next world, they must be in this. By an inevitable\r\nchain of causes and effects, Providence punishes national sins by\r\nnational calamities. He lamented that some of our Eastern brethren\r\nhad, from a lust of gain, embarked in this nefarious traffic. As to\r\nthe States being in possession of the right to import, this was the\r\ncase with many other rights, now to be properly given up. He held it\r\nessential in every point of view, that the General Government should\r\nhave power to prevent the increase of slavery.\r\n\r\nMr. ELLSWORTH, as he had never owned a slave, could not judge of the\r\neffects of slavery on character. He said, however, that if it was to\r\nbe considered in a moral light, we ought to go further and free those\r\nalready in the country. As slaves also multiply so fast in Virginia\r\nand Maryland that it is cheaper to raise than import them, whilst in\r\nthe sickly rice swamps foreign supplies are necessary, if we go no\r\nfurther than is urged, we shall be unjust towards South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia. Let us not intermeddle. As population increases, poor\r\nlaborers will be so plenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery, in\r\ntime, will not be a speck in our country. Provision is already made in\r\nConnecticut for abolishing it. And the abolition has already taken\r\nplace in Massachusetts. As to the danger of insurrections from foreign\r\ninfluence, that will become a motive to kind treatment of the slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. PINCKNEY. If slavery be wrong, it is justified by the example of\r\nall the world. He cited the case of Greece, Rome and other ancient\r\nStates; the sanction given by France, England, Holland and other\r\nmodern States. In all ages one half of mankind have been slaves. If\r\nthe Southern States were let alone, they will probably of themselves\r\nstop importations. He would himself, as a citizen of South Carolina,\r\nvote for it. An attempt to take away the right, as proposed, will\r\nproduce serious objections to the Constitution, which he wished to see\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nGen. PINCKNEY declared it to be his firm opinion that if himself and\r\nall his colleagues were to sign the Constitution and use their\r\npersonal influence, it would be of no avail towards obtaining the\r\nassent of their constituents. South Carolina and Georgia cannot do\r\nwithout slaves. As to Virginia, she will gain by stopping the\r\nimportations. Her slaves will rise in value, and she has more than she\r\nwants. It would be unequal, to require South Carolina and Georgia, to\r\nconfederate on such unequal terms. He said the Royal assent, before\r\nthe Revolution, had never been refused to South Carolina, as to\r\nVirginia. He contended that the importation of slaves would be for the\r\ninterest of the whole Union. The more slaves, the more produce to\r\nemploy the carrying trade; the more consumption also; and the more of\r\nthis, the more revenue for the common treasury. He admitted it to be\r\nreasonable that slaves should be dutied like other imports; but should\r\nconsider a rejection of the clause as an exclusion of South Carolina\r\nfrom the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN had conceived national objects alone to be before the\r\nConvention; not such as, like the present, were of a local nature.\r\nGeorgia was decided on this point. That State has always hitherto\r\nsupposed a General Government to be the pursuit of the central States,\r\nwho wished to have a vortex for everything; that her distance would\r\npreclude her, from equal advantage; and that she could not prudently\r\npurchase it by yielding national powers. From this it might be\r\nunderstood, in what light she would view an attempt to abridge one of\r\nher favorite prerogatives. If left to herself, she may probably put a\r\nstop to the evil. As one ground for this conjecture, he took notice of\r\nthe sect of ----; which he said was a respectable class of people, who\r\ncarried their ethics beyond the mere _equality of men_, extending\r\ntheir humanity to the claims of the whole animal creation.\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON observed that if South Carolina and Georgia were themselves\r\ndisposed to get rid of the importation of slaves in a short time, as\r\nhad been suggested, they would never refuse to unite because the\r\nimportation might be prohibited. As the section now stands, all\r\narticles imported are to be taxed. Slaves alone are exempt. This is in\r\nfact a bounty on that article.\r\n\r\nMr. GERRY thought we had nothing to do with the conduct of the States\r\nas to slaves, but ought to be careful not to give any sanction to it.\r\n\r\nMr. DICKINSON considered it as inadmissible, on every principle of\r\nhonor and safety, that the importation of slaves should be authorized\r\nto the States by the Constitution. The true question was, whether the\r\nnational happiness would be promoted or impeded by the importation;\r\nand this question ought to be left to the National Government, not to\r\nthe States particularly interested. If England and France permit\r\nslavery, slaves are, at the same time, excluded from both those\r\nkingdoms. Greece and Rome were made unhappy by their slaves. He could\r\nnot believe that the Southern States would refuse to confederate on\r\nthe account apprehended; especially as the power was not likely to be\r\nimmediately exercised by the General Government.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAMSON stated the law of North Carolina on the subject, to\r\nwit, that it did not directly prohibit the importation of slaves. It\r\nimposed a duty of £5 on each slave imported from Africa; £10 on each\r\nfrom elsewhere; and £50 on each from a State licensing manumission. He\r\nthought the Southern States could not be members of the Union, if the\r\nclause should be rejected; and that it was wrong to force any thing\r\ndown not absolutely necessary, and which any State must disagree to.\r\n\r\nMr. KING thought the subject should be considered in a political light\r\nonly. If two States will not agree to the Constitution, as stated on\r\none side, he could affirm with equal belief, on the other, that great\r\nand equal opposition would be experienced from the other States. He\r\nremarked on the exemption of slaves from duty, whilst every other\r\nimport was subjected to it, as an inequality that could not fail to\r\nstrike the commercial sagacity of the Northern and Middle States.\r\n\r\nMr. LANGDON was strenuous for giving the power to the General\r\nGovernment. He could not, with a good conscience, leave it with the\r\nStates, who could then go on with the traffic, without being\r\nrestrained by the opinions here given, that they will themselves cease\r\nto import slaves.\r\n\r\nGen. PINCKNEY thought himself bound to declare candidly, that he did\r\nnot think South Carolina would stop her importations of slaves, in any\r\nshort time; but only stop them occasionally as she now does. He moved\r\nto commit the clause, that slaves might be made liable to an equal tax\r\nwith other imports; which he thought right, and which would remove one\r\ndifficulty that had been started.\r\n\r\nMr. RUTLEDGE. If the Convention thinks that North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia, will ever agree to the plan, unless their right\r\nto import slaves be untouched, the expectation is vain. The people of\r\nthose States will never be such fools, as to give up so important an\r\ninterest. He was strenuous against striking out the section, and\r\nseconded the motion of Gen. PINCKNEY for a commitment.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS wished the whole subject to be committed,\r\nincluding the clauses relating to taxes on exports and to a navigation\r\nact. These things may form a bargain among the Northern and Southern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMR. BUTLER declared that he never would agree to the power of taxing\r\nexports.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN said it was better to let the Southern States import\r\nslaves, than to part with them, if they made that a _sine qua non_. He\r\nwas opposed to a tax on slaves imported, as making the matter worse,\r\nbecause it implied they were _property_. He acknowledged that if the\r\npower of prohibiting the importation should be given to the General\r\nGovernment, that it would be exercised. He thought it would be its\r\nduty to exercise the power.\r\n\r\nMr. READ was for the commitment, provided the clause concerning taxes\r\non exports should also be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN observed that that clause had been agreed to, and\r\ntherefore could not be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph was for committing, in order that some middle ground\r\nmight, if possible, be found. He could never agree to the clause as it\r\nstands. He would sooner risk the Constitution. He dwelt on the dilemma\r\nto which the Convention was exposed. By agreeing to the clause, it\r\nwould revolt the Quakers, the Methodists, and many others in the\r\nStates having no slaves. On the other hand, two States might be lost\r\nto the Union. Let us then, he said, try the chance of a commitment.\r\n\r\nOn the question for committing the remaining part of Sections 4 and 5,\r\nof Article 7,--Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, aye--7; New Hampshire,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, no--3; Massachusetts absent.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney and Mr. Langdon moved to commit Section 6, as to a\r\nnavigation act by two-thirds of each House.\r\n\r\nMr. Gorham did not see the propriety of it. Is it meant to require a\r\ngreater proportion of votes? He desired it to be remembered, that the\r\nEastern States had no motive to union but a commercial one. They were\r\nable to protect themselves. They were not afraid of external danger,\r\nand did not need the aid of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson wished for a commitment, in order to reduce the proportion\r\nof votes required.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellsworth was for taking the plan as it is. This widening of\r\nopinions had a threatening aspect. If we do not agree on this middle\r\nand moderate ground, he was afraid we should lose two States, with\r\nsuch others as may be disposed to stand aloof; should fly into a\r\nvariety of shapes and directions, and most probably into several\r\nconfederations,--and not without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nOn the question for committing Section 6, as to a navigation act, to a\r\nmember from each State,--New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,\r\naye--9; Connecticut, New Jersey, no--2.\r\n\r\nThe Committee appointed were Messrs. Langdon, King, Johnson,\r\nLivingston, Clymer, Dickinson, L. Martin, Madison, Williamson, C.C.\r\nPinckney, and Baldwin.\r\n\r\nTo this Committee were referred also the two clauses above mentioned\r\nof the fourth and fifth Sections of Article 7.--pp. 1390 to 1397.\r\n\r\nFriday, August 24, 1787\r\n\r\n_In Convention_,--Governor Livingston, from the committee of eleven,\r\nto whom were referred the two remaining clauses of the fourth section,\r\nand the fifth and sixth sections, of the seventh Article, delivered in\r\nthe following Report:\r\n\r\n\"Strike out so much of the fourth section as was referred to the\r\nCommittee, and insert, 'The migration or importation of such persons\r\nas the several States, now existing, shall think proper to admit,\r\nshall not be prohibited by the Legislature prior to the year 1800; but\r\na tax or duty may be imposed on such migration or importation, at a\r\nrate not exceeding the average of the duties laid on imports.\r\n\r\n\"The fifth Section to remain as in the Report.\r\nThe sixth Section to be stricken out.\"--p. 1415.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, August 25, 1787.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Committee of eleven (see Friday, the twenty-fourth),\r\nbeing taken up,--\r\n\r\nGen. PINCKNEY moved to strike out the words, \"the year eighteen\r\nhundred,\" as the year limiting the importation of slaves; and to\r\ninsert the words, \"the year eighteen hundred and eight.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GORHAM seconded the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. Twenty years will produce all the mischief that can be\r\napprehended from the liberty to import slaves. So long a term will be\r\nmore dishonorable to the American character, than to say nothing about\r\nit in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the motion, which passed in the affirmative,--New-Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, aye--7; New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, no--4.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS was for making the clause read at once, \"the\r\nimportation of slaves in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,\r\nshall not be prohibited, &c.\" This he said, would be most fair, and\r\nwould avoid the ambiguity by which, under the power with regard to\r\nnaturalization, the liberty reserved to the States might be defeated.\r\nHe wished it to be known, also, that this part of the Constitution was\r\na compliance with those States. If the change of language, however,\r\nshould be objected to, by the members from those States, he should not\r\nurge it.\r\n\r\nCol. MASON was not against using the term \"slaves,\" but against naming\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, lest it should give\r\noffence to the people of those States.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN liked a description better than the terms proposed, which\r\nhad been declined by the old Congress, and were not pleasing to some\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMr. CLYMER concurred with Mr. SHERMAN.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAMSON said, that both in opinion and practice he was against\r\nslavery; but thought it more in favor of humanity, from a view of all\r\ncircumstances, to let in South Carolina and Georgia on those terms,\r\nthan to exclude them from the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS withdrew his motion.\r\n\r\nMr. DICKINSON wished the clause to be confined to the States which had\r\nnot themselves prohibited the importation of slaves; and for that\r\npurpose moved to amend the clause, so as to read: \"The importation of\r\nslaves into such of the States as shall permit the same, shall not be\r\nprohibited by the Legislature of the United States, until the year\r\n1808;\" which was disagreed to, _nem. con_.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In the printed Journals, Connecticut, Virginia, and\r\nGeorgia, voted in the affirmative.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first part of the Report was then agreed to, amended as follows:\r\n\"The migration or importation of such persons as the several States\r\nnow existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by\r\nthe Legislature prior to the year 1808,\"--\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, aye--7; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nVirginia, no--4.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN, in order to restrain and more explicitly define, \"the\r\naverage duty,\" moved to strike out of the second part the words,\r\n\"average of the duties laid on imports,\" and insert \"common impost on\r\narticles not enumerated;\" which was agreed to, _nem. con_.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN was against this second part, as acknowledging men to be\r\nproperty, by taxing them as such under the character of slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. KING and Mr. LANGDON considered this as the price of the first\r\npart. Gen. PINCKNEY admitted that it was so. Col. MASON. Not to tax,\r\nwill be equivalent to a bounty on, the importation of slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. GORHAM thought that Mr. SHERMAN should consider the duty, not as\r\nimplying that slaves are property, but as a discouragement to the\r\nimportation of them.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS remarked, that, as the clause now stands, it\r\nimplies that the Legislature may tax freemen imported.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN, in answer to Mr. GORHAM, observed, that the smallness of\r\nthe duty showed revenue to be the object, not the discouragement of\r\nthe importation.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea\r\nthat there could be property in men. The reason of duties did not\r\nhold, as slaves are not, like merchandize consumed, &c.\r\n\r\nCol. MASON, in answer to Mr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. The provision, as it\r\nstands, was necessary for the case of convicts, in order to prevent\r\nthe introduction of them.\r\n\r\nIt was finally agreed, _nem. con_., to make the clause read: \"but a\r\ntax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten\r\ndollars for each person;\" and then the second part, as amended, was\r\nagreed to.--_pp_. 1427 to 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, August 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 14, was then taken up.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Article 14 was,--The citizens of each State shall be\r\nentitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several\r\nStates.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral PINCKNEY was not satisfied with it. He seemed to wish some\r\nprovision should be included in favor of property in slaves.\r\n\r\nOn the question on Article 14,--New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, aye--9; South Carolina, no--1; Georgia, divided.\r\n\r\nArticle 15,[6] being then taken up, the words, \"high misdemeanor,\"\r\nwere struck out, and the words, \"other crime,\" inserted, in order to\r\ncomprehend all proper cases; it being doubtful whether \"high\r\nmisdemeanor\" had not a technical meaning too limited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Article 15 was,--Any person charged with treason, felony\r\nor high misdemeanor in any State, who shall flee from justice, and\r\nshall be found in any other State, shall, on demand of the Executive\r\npower of the State from which he fled, be delivered up and removed to\r\nthe State having jurisdiction of the offence.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER and Mr. PINCKNEY moved to require \"fugitive slaves and\r\nservants to be delivered up like criminals.\"\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON. This would oblige the Executive of the State to do it, at\r\nthe public expense.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN saw no more propriety in the public seizing and\r\nsurrendering a slave or servant, than a horse.\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER withdrew his proposition, in order that some particular\r\nprovision might be made, apart from this article.\r\n\r\nArticle 15, as amended, was then agreed to, _nem. con_.--_pp_. 1447-8.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, AUGUST 29, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 7, Section 6, by the Committee of Eleven reported to be struck\r\nout (see the twenty-fourth inst.) being now taken up,--\r\n\r\nMr. PINCKNEY moved to postpone the Report, in favor of the following\r\nproposition: \"That no act of the Legislature for the purpose of\r\nregulating the Commerce of the United States with foreign powers,\r\namong the several States, shall be passed without the assent of\r\ntwo-thirds of the members of each House.\" He remarked that there were\r\nfive distinct commercial interests.\r\n\r\nThe power of regulating commerce was a pure concession on the part of\r\nthe Southern States. They did not need the protection of the Northern\r\nStates at present.--_p_. 1450.\r\n\r\nGeneral PINCKNEY said it was the true interest of the Southern States\r\nto have no regulation of commerce; but considering the loss brought on\r\nthe commerce of the Eastern States by the Revolution, their liberal\r\nconduct towards the views[7] of South Carolina, and the interest the\r\nweak Southern States had in being united with the strong Eastern\r\nStates, he thought it proper that no fetters should be imposed on the\r\npower of making commercial regulations, and that his constituents,\r\nthough prejudiced against the Eastern States, would be reconciled to\r\nthis liberality. He had, himself, he said, prejudices against the\r\nEastern States before he came here, but would acknowledge that he had\r\nfound them as liberal and candid as any men whatever.--_p_. 1451.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: He meant the permission to import slaves. An understanding\r\non the two subjects of _navigation_ and _slavery_, had taken place\r\nbetween those parts of the Union, which explains the vote of the\r\nmotion depending, as well as the language of General Pinckney and\r\nothers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. PINCKNEY replied, that his enumeration meant the five minute\r\ninterests. It still left the two great divisions of Northern and\r\nSouthern interests.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS opposed the object of the motion as highly\r\ninjurious.--A navy was essential to security, particularly of the\r\nSouthern States;--\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAMSON. As to the weakness of the Southern States, he was not\r\nalarmed on that account. The sickliness of their climate for invaders\r\nwould prevent their being made an object. He acknowledged that he did\r\nnot think the motion requiring two-thirds necessary in itself; because\r\nif a majority of the Northern States should push their regulations too\r\nfar, the Southern States would build ships for themselves; but he knew\r\nthe Southern people were apprehensive on this subject, and would be\r\npleased with the precaution.\r\n\r\nMr. SPAIGHT was against the motion. The Southern States could at any\r\ntime save themselves from oppression, by building ships for their own\r\nuse.--_p_. 1452.\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER differed from those who considered the rejection of the\r\nmotion as no concession on the part of the Southern States. He\r\nconsidered the interests of these and of the Eastern States to be as\r\ndifferent as the interests of Russia and Turkey. Being,\r\nnotwithstanding, desirous of conciliating the affections of the\r\nEastern States, he should vote against requiring two-thirds instead of\r\na majority.--_p_. 1453.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. He added, that the Southern States would derive an\r\nessential advantage, in the general security afforded by the increase\r\nof our maritime strength. He stated the vulnerable situation of them\r\nall, and of Virginia in particular.\r\n\r\nMr. RUTLEDGE was against the motion of his colleague. At the worst, a\r\nnavigation act could bear hard a little while only on the Southern\r\nStates. As we are laying the foundation for a great empire, we ought\r\nto take a permanent view of the subject, and not look at the present\r\nmoment only.\r\n\r\nMr. GORMAN. The Eastern States were not led to strengthen the Union by\r\nfear for their own safety.\r\n\r\nHe deprecated the consequences of disunion; but if it should take\r\nplace, it was the Southern part of the Continent that had most reason\r\nto dread them.\r\n\r\nOn the question to postpone, in order to take up Mr. PINCKNEY's\r\nmotion,--\r\n\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, aye--4; New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, South\r\nCarolina, no--7. The Report of the Committee for striking out Section\r\n6, requiring two-thirds of each House to pass a navigation act, was\r\nthen agreed to, _nem. con_.\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER moved to insert after Article 15, \"If any person bound to\r\nservice or labor in any of the United States, shall escape into\r\nanother State, he or she shall not be discharged from such service or\r\nlabor, in consequence of any regulations subsisting in the State to\r\nwhich they escape, but shall be delivered up to the person justly\r\nclaiming their service or labor,\"--which was agreed to, _nem.\r\ncon_.--_p_. 1454-5-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, August 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 18, being taken up,\r\n\r\nOn a question for striking out \"domestic violence,\" and inserting\r\n\"insurrections,\" it passed in the negative,--New Jersey, Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, aye--5; New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,\r\nno--6.--_pp_. 1466-7.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, September 10, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. RUTLEDGE said he never could agree to give a power by which the\r\narticles relating to slaves might be altered by the States not\r\ninterested in that property, and prejudiced against it. In order to\r\nobviate this objection, these words were added to the proposition:\r\n\"provided that no amendments, which may be made prior to the year 1808\r\nshall in any manner affect the fourth and fifth sections of the\r\nseventh Article:\"--_p_. 1536.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, September 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 1, Section 2. On motion of Mr. RANDOLPH, the word \"servitude\"\r\nwas struck out, and \"service\" unanimously[8] inserted, the former\r\nbeing thought to express the condition of slaves, and the latter the\r\nobligations of free persons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8:  See page 372 of the printed journal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. DICKENSON and Mr. WILSON moved to strike out, \"and direct taxes,\"\r\nfrom Article 1, Section 2, as improperly placed in a clause relating\r\nmerely to the Constitution of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. The insertion here was in consequence of what\r\nhad passed on this point; in order to exclude the appearance of\r\ncounting the negroes in the _representation_. The including of them\r\nmay now be referred to the object of direct taxes, and incidentally\r\nonly to that of representation.\r\n\r\nOn the motion to strike out, \"and direct taxes,\" from this place,--\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, aye--3; New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, no--8.--_pp_. 1569-70.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, September 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nArticle 4, Section 2, (the third paragraph,) the term \"legally\" was\r\nstruck out; and the words, \"under the laws thereof,\" inserted after\r\nthe word \"State,\" in compliance with the wish of some who thought the\r\nterm _legal_ equivocal, and favoring the idea that slavery was legal\r\nin a moral view.--p. 1589.\r\n\r\nMr. GERRY stated the objections which determined him to withhold his\r\nname from the Constitution: 1-2-3-4-5-6, that three-fifths of the\r\nblacks are to be represented, as if they were freemen.--p. 1595.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIST OF MEMBERS\r\nOF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION WHO FORMED THE CONSTITUTION OF\r\n                    THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From_                                 _Attended._\r\nNew Hampshire,     1 John Langdon,           July 23, 1787.\r\n                    _John Pickering_,\r\n                   2 Nicholas Gilman,         \"   23.\r\n                    _Benjamin West_,\r\nMassachusetts,      _Francis Dana_,\r\n                     Elbridge Gerry,          May 29.\r\n                   3 Nath'l Gorham,            \"  28.\r\n                   4 Rufus King,               \"  25.\r\n                     Caleb Strong,            May 28.\r\nRhode Island,       (No appointment.)\r\nConnecticut,       5 W.S.

As the system was reported by the committee of detail, the\r\nprovision was general, that such importation should not be prohibited,\r\nwithout confining it to any particular period. This was rejected by\r\neight States--Georgia, South Carolina, and, I think, North Carolina,\r\nvoting for it.\r\n\r\nWe were then told by the delegates of the two first of those States,\r\nthat their States would never agree to a system, which put it in the\r\npower of the general government to prevent the importation of slaves,\r\nand that they, as delegates from those States, must withhold their\r\nassent from such a system.\r\n\r\nA committee of one member from each State was chosen by ballot, to\r\ntake this part of the system under their consideration, and to\r\nendeavor to agree upon some report, which should reconcile those\r\nStates. To this committee also was referred the following proposition,\r\nwhich had been reported by the committee of detail, to wit: \"No\r\nnavigation act shall be passed without the assent of two-thirds of the\r\nmembers present in each house;\" a proposition which the staple and\r\ncommercial States were solicitous to retain, lest their commerce\r\nshould be placed too much under the power of the Eastern States; but\r\nwhich these last States were as anxious to reject. This committee, of\r\nwhich also I had the honor to be a member, met and took under their\r\nconsideration the subjects committed to them. I found the _Eastern_\r\nStates, notwithstanding their _aversion to slavery_, were very willing\r\nto indulge the Southern States, at least with a temporary liberty to\r\nprosecute the _slave trade_, provided the Southern States would in\r\ntheir turn gratify them, by laying no restriction on navigation acts;\r\nand after a very little time, the committee, by a great majority,\r\nagreed on a report, by which the general government was to be\r\nprohibited from preventing the importation of slaves for a limited\r\ntime, and the restricted clause relative to navigation acts was to be\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\nThis report was adopted by a majority of the Convention, but not\r\nwithout considerable opposition.\r\n\r\nIt was said, we had just assumed a place among independent nations in\r\nconsequence of our opposition to the attempts of Great Britain to\r\n_enslave us_; that this opposition was grounded upon the preservation\r\nof those rights to which God and nature had entitled us, not in\r\n_particular_, but in _common_ with all the rest of mankind; that we\r\nhad appealed to the Supreme Being for his assistance, as the God of\r\nfreedom, who could not but approve our efforts to preserve the\r\n_rights_ which he had thus imparted to his creatures; that now, when\r\nwe had scarcely risen from our knees, from supplicating his mercy and\r\nprotection in forming our government over a free people, a government\r\nformed pretendedly on the principles of liberty, and for its\r\npreservation,--in that government to have a provision not only putting\r\nit out of its power to restrain and prevent the slave trade, even\r\nencouraging that most infamous traffic, by giving the States the power\r\nand influence in the Union in proportion as they cruelly and wantonly\r\nsported with the rights of their fellow-creatures, ought to be\r\nconsidered as a solemn mockery of, and an insult to, that God whose\r\nprotection we had then implored, and could not fail to hold us up in\r\ndetestation, and render us contemptible to every true friend of\r\nliberty in the world. It was said, it ought be considered that\r\nnational crimes can only be, and frequently are, punished in this\r\nworld by national punishments; and that the continuance of the slave\r\ntrade, and thus giving it a national sanction, and encouragement,\r\nought to be considered as justly exposing us to the displeasure and\r\nvengeance of him who is equally Lord of all, and who views with equal\r\neye the poor African slave and his American master!\r\n\r\nIt was urged that by this system, we were giving the general\r\ngovernment full and absolute power to regulate commerce, under which\r\ngeneral power it would have a right to restrain, or totally prohibit,\r\nthe slave trade: it must, therefore, appear to the world absurd and\r\ndisgraceful to the last degree, that we should except from the\r\nexercise of that power, the only branch of commerce which is\r\nunjustifiable in its nature, and contrary to the rights of mankind.\r\nThat, on the contrary, we ought rather to prohibit expressly in our\r\nConstitution, the further importation of slaves, and to authorize the\r\ngeneral government, from time to time, to make such regulations as\r\nshould be thought most advantageous for the gradual abolition of\r\nslavery, and the emancipation of the slaves which are already in the\r\nStates. That slavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism,\r\nand has a tendency to destroy those principles on which it is\r\nsupported, as it lessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind, and\r\nhabituates us to tyranny and oppression. It was further urged, that,\r\nby this system of government, every State is to be protected both from\r\nforeign invasion and from domestic insurrections; from this\r\nconsideration, it was of the utmost importance it should have a power\r\nto restrain the importation of slaves, since, in proportion as the\r\nnumber of slaves are increased in any State, in the same proportion\r\nthe State is weakened and exposed to foreign invasion or domestic\r\ninsurrection, and by so much less will it be able to protect itself\r\nagainst either, and therefore will by so much the more want aid from,\r\nand be a burden to, the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was further said, that, as in this system we were giving the\r\ngeneral government a power, under the idea of national character, or\r\nnational interest, to regulate even our weights and measures, and have\r\nprohibited all possibility of emitting paper money, and passing\r\ninsolvent laws, &c., it must appear still more extraordinary, that we\r\nshould prohibit the government from interfering with both slave trade,\r\nthan which nothing could so materially affect both our national honor\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nThese reasons influenced me, both on the committee and in convention,\r\nmost decidedly to oppose and vote against the clause, as it now makes\r\npart of the system.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, sir, not only that the general government is\r\nprohibited from interfering in the slave trade before the year\r\neighteen hundred and eight, but that there is no provision in the\r\nConstitution that it shall afterwards be prohibited, nor any security\r\nthat such prohibition will ever take place; and I think there is great\r\nreason to believe, that, if the importation of slaves is permitted\r\nuntil the year eighteen hundred and eight, it will not be prohibited\r\nafterwards. At this time, we do not generally hold this commerce in so\r\ngreat abhorrence as we have done. When our liberties were at stake, we\r\nwarmly felt for the common rights of men. The danger being thought to\r\nbe past, which threatened ourselves, we are daily growing more\r\ninsensible to those rights. In those States which have restrained or\r\nprohibited the importation of slaves, it is only done by legislative\r\nacts, which may be repealed. When those States find that they must, in\r\ntheir national character and connexion, suffer in the disgrace, and\r\nshare in the inconveniences attendant upon that detestable and\r\niniquitous traffic, they may be desirous also to share in the benefits\r\narising from it; and the odium attending it will be greatly effaced by\r\nthe sanction which is given to it in the general government.\r\n\r\nBy the next paragraph, the general government is to have a power of\r\nsuspending the _habeas corpus act_, in cases of _rebellion_ or\r\n_invasion_.\r\n\r\nAs the State governments have a power of suspending the habeas corpus\r\nact in those cases, it was said, there could be no reason for giving\r\nsuch a power to the general government; since, whenever the State\r\nwhich is invaded, or in which an insurrection takes place, finds its\r\nsafety requires it, it will make use of that power. And it was urged,\r\nthat if we gave this power to the general government, it would be an\r\nengine of oppression in its hands; since whenever a State should\r\noppose its views, however arbitrary and unconstitutional, and refuse\r\nsubmission to them, the general government may declare it to be an act\r\nof rebellion, and, suspending the habeas corpus act, may seize upon\r\nthe persons of those advocates of freedom, who have had virtue and\r\nresolution enough to excite the opposition, and may imprison them\r\nduring its pleasure in the remotest part of the Union; so that a\r\ncitizen of Georgia might be _bastiled_ in the furthest part of New\r\nHampshire; or a citizen of New Hampshire in the furthest extreme of\r\nthe South, cut off from their family, their friends, and their every\r\nconnexion. These considerations induced me, sir, to give my negative\r\nalso to this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM DEBATES IN THE SEVERAL STATE CONVENTIONS ON THE ADOPTION\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES' CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe third paragraph of the 2d section being read,\r\n\r\nMr. KING rose to explain it. There has, says he, been much\r\nmisconception of this section. It is a principle of this Constitution,\r\nthat representation and taxation should go hand in hand. This\r\nparagraph states, that the number of free persons shall be determined,\r\nby adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound\r\nto service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed,\r\nthree-fifths of all other persons. These persons are the slaves. By\r\nthis rule is representation and taxation to be apportioned. And it was\r\nadopted, because it was the language of all America.\r\n\r\nMr. WIDGERY asked, if a boy of six years of age was to be considered\r\nas a free person?\r\n\r\nMr. KING in answer said, all persons born free were to be considered\r\nas freemen; and to make the idea of _taxation by numbers_ more\r\nintelligible, said that five negro children of South Carolina, are to\r\npay as much tax as the three Governors of New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, and Connecticut.\r\n\r\nMr. GORHAM thought the proposed section much in favor of\r\nMassachusetts; and if it operated against any State, it was\r\nPennsylvania, because they have more white persons _bound_ than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nJudge DANA, in reply to the remark of some gentlemen, that the\r\nsouthern States were favored in this mode of apportionment, by having\r\nfive of their negroes set against three persons in the eastern, the\r\nhonorable judge observed, that the negroes of the southern States work\r\nno longer than when the eye of the driver is on them. Can, asked he,\r\nthat land flourish like this, which is cultivated by the hands of\r\nfreemen? Are not _three_ of these independent freemen of more real\r\nadvantage to a State, than _five_ of those poor slaves?\r\n\r\nMr. NASSON remarked on the statement of the honorable Mr. KING, by\r\nsaying that the honorable gentleman should have gone further, and\r\nshown us the other side of the question. It is a good rule that works\r\nboth ways--and the gentleman should also have told us, that three of\r\nour infants in the cradle, are to be rated as high as five of the\r\nworking negroes of Virginia. Mr. N. adverted to a statement of Mr.\r\nKING, who had said, that five negro children of South Carolina were\r\nequally rateable as three governors of New England, and wished, he\r\nsaid, the honorable gentleman had considered this question upon the\r\nother side--as it would then appear that this State will pay as great\r\na tax for three children in the cradle, as any of the southern States\r\nwill for five hearty working negro men. He hoped, he said, while we\r\nwere making a new government, we should make it better than the old\r\none: for if we had made a bad bargain before, as had been hinted, it\r\nwas a reason why we should make a better one now.\r\n\r\nMr. DAWES said, he was sorry to hear so many objections raised against\r\nthe paragraph under consideration. He though them wholly unfounded;\r\nthat the black inhabitants of the southern States must be considered\r\neither as slaves, and as so much property, or in the character of so\r\nmany freemen; if the former, why should they not be wholly\r\nrepresented? Our _own_ State laws and Constitution would lead us to\r\nconsider those blacks as _freemen_, and so indeed would our own ideas\r\nof natural justice: if, then, they are freemen, they might form an\r\nequal basis for representation as though they were all white\r\ninhabitants. In either view, therefore, he could not see that the\r\nnorthern States would suffer, but directly to the contrary. He\r\nthought, however, that gentlemen would do well to connect the passage\r\nin dispute with another article in the Constitution, that permits\r\nCongress, in the year 1808, wholly to prohibit the importation of\r\nslaves, and in the mean time to impose a duty of ten dollars a head on\r\nsuch blacks as should be imported before that period. Besides, by the\r\nnew Constitution, every particular State is left to its own option\r\ntotally to prohibit the introduction of slaves into its own\r\nterritories. What could the convention do more? The members of the\r\nsouthern States, like ourselves, have _their_ prejudices. It would not\r\ndo to abolish slavery, by an act of Congress, in a moment, and so\r\ndestroy what our southern brethren consider as property. But we may\r\nsay, that although slavery is not smitten by an apoplexy, yet it has\r\nreceived a mortal wound and will die of a consumption.\r\n\r\nMr. NEAL (from Kittery,) went over the ground of objection to this\r\nsection on the idea that the slave trade was allowed to be continued\r\nfor 20 years. His profession, he said, obliged him to bear witness\r\nagainst any thing that should favor the making merchandise of the\r\nbodies of men, and unless his objection was removed, he could not put\r\nhis hand to the Constitution. Other gentlemen said, in addition to\r\nthis idea, that there was not even a proposition that the negroes ever\r\nshall be free, and Gen. THOMPSON exclaimed:\r\n\r\nMr. President, shall it be said, that after we have established our\r\nown independence and freedom, we make slaves of others? Oh!\r\nWashington, what a name has he had! How he has immortalized himself!\r\nbut he holds those in slavery who have a good right to be free as he\r\nhas--he is still for self; and, in my opinion, his character has sunk\r\n50 per cent.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, gentlemen said, that the step taken in this article\r\ntowards the abolition of slavery, was one of the beauties of the\r\nConstitution. They observed, that in the confederation there was no\r\nprovision whatever for its ever being abolished; but this Constitution\r\nprovides, that Congress may, after 20 years, totally annihilate the\r\nslave trade; and that, as all the States, except two, have passed laws\r\nto this effect, it might reasonably be expected, that it would then be\r\ndone. In the interim, all the States were at liberty to prohibit it.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, January 26.--[The debate on the 9th section still continued\r\ndesultory--and consisted of similar objections, and answers thereto,\r\nas had before been used. Both sides deprecated the slave trade in the\r\nmost pointed terms; on one side it was pathetically lamented, by Mr.\r\nNASON, Major LUSK, Mr. NEAL, and others, that this Constitution\r\nprovided for the continuation of the slave trade for 20 years. On the\r\nother, the honorable Judge DANA, Mr. ADAMS and others, rejoiced that a\r\ndoor was now to be opened for the annihilation of this odious,\r\nabhorrent practice, in a certain time.]\r\n\r\nGen. HEATH. Mr. President,--By my indisposition and absence, I have\r\nlost several important opportunities: I have lost the opportunity\r\nof expressing my sentiments with a candid freedom, on some of the\r\nparagraphs of the system, which have lain heavy on my mind. I have\r\nlost the opportunity of expressing my warm approbation on some of the\r\nparagraphs. I have lost the opportunity of hearing those judicious,\r\nenlightening and convincing arguments, which have been advanced during\r\nthe investigation of the system. This is my misfortune, and I must\r\nbear it. The paragraph respecting the migration or importation of such\r\npersons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit,\r\n&c., is one of those considered during my absence, and I have heard\r\nnothing on the subject, save what has been mentioned this morning; but\r\nI think the gentlemen who have spoken, have carried the matter rather\r\ntoo far on both sides. I apprehend that it is not in our power to do\r\nany thing for or against those who are in slavery in the southern\r\nStates. No gentleman within these walls detests every idea of slavery\r\nmore than I do: it is generally detested by the people of this\r\nCommonwealth; and I ardently hope that the time will soon come, when\r\nour brethren in the southern States will view it as we do, and put a\r\nstop to it; but to this we have no right to compel them. Two questions\r\nnaturally arise: if we ratify the Constitution, shall we do any thing\r\nby our act to hold the blacks in slavery--or shall we become the\r\npartakers of other men's sins? I think neither of them. Each State is\r\nsovereign and independent to a certain degree, and they have a right,\r\nand will regulate their own internal affairs, as to themselves appears\r\nproper; and shall we refuse to eat, or to drink, or to be united, with\r\nthose who do not think, or act, just as we do? surely not. We are not\r\nin this case partakers of other men's sins, for in nothing do we\r\nvoluntarily encourage the slavery of our fellow-men; a restriction is\r\nlaid on the Federal Government, which could not be avoided, and a\r\nunion take place. The Federal Convention went as far as they could;\r\nthe migration or importation, &c., is confined to the States, now\r\n_existing only_, new States cannot claim it. Congress, by their\r\nordinance for erecting new States, some time since, declared that the\r\nnew States shall be republican, and that there shall be no slavery in\r\nthem. But whether those in slavery in the southern States will be\r\nemancipated after the year 1808, I do not pretend to determine: I\r\nrather doubt it.\r\n\r\nMr. NEAL rose and said, that as the Constitution at large, was now\r\nunder consideration, he would just remark, that the article which\r\nrespected the Africans, was the one which laid on his mind--and,\r\nunless his objections to that were removed, it must, how much soever\r\nhe liked the other parts of the Constitution, be a sufficient reason\r\nfor him to give his negative to it.\r\n\r\nMajor LUSK concurred in the idea already thrown out in the debate,\r\nthat although the insertion of the amendments in the Constitution was\r\ndevoutly wished, yet he did not see any reason to suppose they ever\r\nwould be adopted. Turning from the subject of amendments, the Major\r\nentered largely into the consideration of the 9th section, and in the\r\nmost pathetic and feeling manner, described the miseries of the poor\r\nnatives of Africa, who are kidnapped and sold for slaves. With the\r\nbrightest colors he painted their happiness and ease on their native\r\nshores, and contrasted them with their wretched, miserable and unhappy\r\ncondition, in a state of slavery.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. BACKUS. Much, sir, hath been said about the importation of\r\nslaves into this country. I believe that, according to my capacity, no\r\nman abhors that wicked practice more than I do, and would gladly make\r\nuse of all lawful means towards the abolishing of slavery in all parts\r\nof the land. But let us consider where we are, and what we are doing.\r\nIn the articles of confederation, no provision was made to hinder the\r\nimportation of slaves into any of these States: but a door is now\r\nopened hereafter to do it; and each State is at liberty now to abolish\r\nslavery as soon as they please. And let us remember our former\r\nconnexion with Great Britain, from whom many in our land think we\r\nought not to have revolted. How did they carry on the slave trade! I\r\nknow that the Bishop of Gloucester, in an annual sermon in London, in\r\nFebruary, 1766, endeavored to justify their tyrannical claims of power\r\nover us, by casting the reproach of the slave trade upon the\r\nAmericans. But at the close of the war, the Bishop of Chester, in an\r\nannual sermon, in February, 1783, ingenuously owned, that their nation\r\nis the most deeply involved in the guilt of that trade, of any nation\r\nin the world; and also, that they have treated their slaves in the\r\nWest Indies worse than the French or Spaniards have done theirs. Thus\r\nslavery grows more and more odious through the world; and, as an\r\nhonorable gentleman said some days ago, \"Though we cannot say that\r\nslavery is struck with an apoplexy, yet we may hope it will die with a\r\nconsumption.\" And a main source, sir, of that iniquity, hath been an\r\nabuse of the covenant of circumcision, which gave the seed of Abraham\r\nto destroy the inhabitants of Canaan, and to take their houses,\r\nvineyards, and all their estates, as their own; and also to buy and\r\nhold others as servants. And as Christian privileges are greater than\r\nthose of the Hebrews were, many have imagined that they had a right to\r\nseize upon the lands of the heathen, and to destroy or enslave them as\r\nfar as they could extend their power. And from thence the mystery of\r\niniquity, carried many into the practice of making merchandise of\r\nslaves and souls of men. But all ought to remember, that when God\r\npromised the land of Canaan to Abraham and his seed, he let him know\r\nthat they were not to take possession of that land, until the iniquity\r\nof the Amorites was full; and then they did it under the immediate\r\ndirection of Heaven; and they were as real executors of the judgment\r\nof God upon those heathens, as any person ever was an executor of a\r\ncriminal justly condemned. And in doing it they were not allowed to\r\ninvade the lands of the Edomites, who sprang from Esau, who was not\r\nonly of the seed of Abraham, but was born at the same birth with\r\nIsrael; and yet they were not of that church. Neither were Israel\r\nallowed to invade the lands of the Moabites, or of the children of\r\nAmmon, who were of the seed of Lot. And no officer in Israel had any\r\nlegislative power, but such as were immediately inspired. Even David,\r\nthe man after God's own heart, had no legislative power, but only as\r\nhe was inspired from above: and he is expressly called a _prophet_ in\r\nthe New Testament And we are to remember that Abraham and his seed,\r\nfor four hundred years, had no warrant to admit any strangers into\r\nthat church, but by buying of him as a servant, with money. And it was\r\na great privilege to be bought, and adopted into a religious family\r\nfor seven years, and then to have their freedom. And that covenant was\r\nexpressly repealed in various parts of the New Testament; and\r\nparticularly in the first epistle to the Corinthians, wherein it is\r\nsaid--Ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body,\r\nand in your spirit, which are God's. And again--Circumcision is\r\nnothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping of the\r\ncommandments of God. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the\r\nservants of men. Thus the gospel sets all men upon a level, very\r\ncontrary to the declaration of an honorable gentleman in this house,\r\n\"that the Bible was contrived for the advantage of a particular order\r\nof men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nMr. M. SMITH. He would now proceed to state his objections to the\r\nclause just read, (section 2, of article 1, clause 3). His objections\r\nwere comprised under three heads: 1st, the rule of apportionment is\r\nunjust; 2d, there is no precise number fixed on, below which the house\r\nshall not be reduced; 3d, it is inadequate. In the first place, the\r\nrule of apportionment of the representatives is to be according to the\r\nwhole number of the white inhabitants, with three-fifths of all\r\nothers; that is, in plain English, each State is to send\r\nrepresentatives in proportion to the number of freemen, and\r\nthree-fifths of the slaves it contains. He could not see any rule by\r\nwhich slaves were to be included in the ratio of representation;--the\r\nprinciple of a representation being that every free agent should be\r\nconcerned in governing himself, it was absurd to give that power to a\r\nman who could not exercise it--slaves have no will of their own: the\r\nvery operation of it was to give certain privileges to those people\r\nwho were so wicked as to keep slaves. He knew it would be admitted,\r\nthat this rule of apportionment was founded on unjust principles, but\r\nthat it was the result of accommodation; which, he supposed, we should\r\nbe under the necessity of admitting, if we meant to be in union with\r\nthe southern States, though utterly repugnant to his feelings.\r\n\r\nMr. HAMILTON. In order that the committee may understand clearly the\r\nprinciples on which the General Convention acted, I think it necessary\r\nto explain some preliminary circumstances.\r\n\r\nSir, the natural situation of this country seems to divide its\r\ninterests into different classes. There are navigating and\r\nnon-navigating States--the Northern are properly the navigating\r\nStates: the Southern appear to possess neither the means nor the\r\nspirit of navigation. This difference of situation naturally produces\r\na dissimilarity of interest and views respecting foreign commerce. It\r\nwas the interest of the Northern States that there should be no\r\nrestraints on the navigation, and that they should have full power, by\r\na majority on Congress, to make commercial regulations. The Southern\r\nStates wished to impose a restraint on the Northern, by requiring that\r\ntwo-thirds in Congress should be requisite to pass an act in\r\nregulation of commerce: they were apprehensive that the restraints of\r\na navigation law would discourage foreigners, and by obliging them to\r\nemploy the shipping of the Northern States would probably enhance\r\ntheir freight. This being the case, they insisted strenuously on\r\nhaving this provision engrafted in the Constitution; and the Northern\r\nStates were as anxious in opposing it. On the other hand, the small\r\nStates seeing themselves embraced by the confederation upon equal\r\nterms, wished to retain the advantages which they already possessed:\r\nthe large States, on the contrary, thought it improper that Rhode\r\nIsland and Delaware should enjoy an equal suffrage with themselves:\r\nfrom these sources a delicate and difficult contest arose. It became\r\nnecessary, therefore, to compromise; or the Convention must have\r\ndissolved without effecting any thing. Would it have been wise and\r\nprudent in that body, in this critical situation, to have deserted\r\ntheir country? No. Every man who hears me--every wise man in the\r\nUnited States, would have condemned them. The Convention were obliged\r\nto appoint a committee for accommodation. In this committee the\r\narrangement was formed as it now stands; and their report was\r\naccepted. It was a delicate point; and it was necessary that all\r\nparties should be indulged. Gentlemen will see, that if there had not\r\nbeen a unanimity, nothing could have been done: for the Convention had\r\nno power to establish, but only to recommend a government. Any other\r\nsystem would have been impracticable. Let a Convention be called\r\nto-morrow--let them meet twenty times; nay, twenty thousand times;\r\nthey will have the same difficulties to encounter; the same clashing\r\ninterests to reconcile.\r\n\r\nBut dismissing these reflections, let us consider how far the\r\narrangement is in itself entitled to the approbation of this body. We\r\nwill examine it upon its own merits.\r\n\r\nThe first thing objected to, is that clause which allows a\r\nrepresentation for three-fifths of the negroes. Much has been said of\r\nthe impropriety of representing men, who have no will of their own.\r\nWhether this be reasoning or declamation, I will not presume to say.\r\nIt is the unfortunate situation of the southern States, to have a\r\ngreat part of their population, as well as property, in blacks. The\r\nregulations complained of was one result of the spirit of\r\naccommodation, which governed the Convention; and without this\r\nindulgence, no union could possibly have been formed. But, sir,\r\nconsidering some peculiar advantages which we derived from them, it is\r\nentirely just that they should be gratified. The southern States\r\npossess certain staples, tobacco, rice, indigo, &c., which must be\r\ncapital objects in treaties of commerce with foreign nations; and the\r\nadvantage which they necessarily procure in these treaties will be\r\nfelt throughout all the States. But the justice of this plan will\r\nappear in another view. The best writers on government have held that\r\nrepresentation should be compounded of persons and property. This rule\r\nhas been adopted, as far as it could be, in the Constitution of New\r\nYork. It will, however, by no means, be admitted, that the slaves are\r\nconsidered altogether as property. They are men, though degraded to\r\nthe condition of slavery. They are persons known to the municipal laws\r\nof the States which they inhabit as well as to the laws of nature. But\r\nrepresentation and taxation go together--and one uniform rule ought to\r\napply to both. Would it be just to compute these slaves in the\r\nassessment of taxes, and discard them from the estimate in the\r\napportionment of representatives? Would it be just to impose a\r\nsingular burthen, without conferring some adequate advantage?\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance ought to be considered. The rule we have been\r\nspeaking of is a general rule, and applies to all the States. Now, you\r\nhave a great number of people in your State, which are not represented\r\nat all; and have no voice in your government: these will be included\r\nin the enumeration--not two-fifths--nor three-fifths, but the whole.\r\nThis proves that the advantages of the plan are not confined to the\r\nsouthern States, but extend to other parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. M. SMITH. I shall make no reply to the arguments offered by the\r\nhonorable gentleman to justify the rule of apportionment fixed by this\r\nclause: for though I am confident they might be easily refuted, yet I\r\nam persuaded we must yield this point, in accommodation to the\r\nsouthern States. The amendment therefore proposes no alteration to the\r\nclause in this respect.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRISON. Among the objections, that, which has been made to the\r\nmode of apportionment of representatives, has been relinquished. I\r\nthink this concession does honor to the gentleman who had stated the\r\nobjection. He has candidly acknowledged, that this apportionment was\r\nthe result of accommodation; without which no union could have been\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON. Much fault has been found with the mode of expression,\r\nused in the first clause of the ninth section of the first article. I\r\nbelieve I can assign a reason, why that mode of expression was used,\r\nand why the term slave was not admitted in this Constitution--and as\r\nto the manner of laying taxes, this is not the first time that the\r\nsubject has come into the view of the United States, and of the\r\nLegislatures of the several States. The gentleman, (Mr. FINDLEY) will\r\nrecollect, that in the present Congress, the quota of the federal\r\ndebt, and general expenses, was to be in proportion to the value of\r\nland, and other enumerated property, within the States. After trying\r\nthis for a number of years, it was found on all hands, to be a mode\r\nthat could not be carried into execution. Congress were satisfied of\r\nthis, and in the year 1783 recommended, in conformity with the powers\r\nthey possessed under the articles of confederation, that the quota\r\nshould be according to the number of free people, including those\r\nbound to servitude, and excluding Indians not taxed. These were the\r\nexpressions used in 1783, and the fate of this recommendation was\r\nsimilar to all their other resolutions. It was not carried into\r\neffect, but it was adopted by no fewer than eleven, out of thirteen\r\nStates; and it cannot but be matter of surprise, to hear gentlemen,\r\nwho agreed to this very mode of expression at that time, come forward\r\nand state it as an objection on the present occasion. It was natural,\r\nsir, for the late convention, to adopt the mode after it had been\r\nagreed to by eleven States, and to use the expression, which they\r\nfound had been received as unexceptionable before. With respect to the\r\nclause, restricting Congress from prohibiting the migration or\r\nimportation of such persons, as any of the States now existing, shall\r\nthink proper to admit, prior to the year 1808. The honorable gentleman\r\nsays, that this clause is not only dark, but intended to grant to\r\nCongress, for that time, the power to admit the importation of slaves.\r\nNo such thing was intended; but I will tell you what was done, and it\r\ngives me high pleasure, that so much was done. Under the present\r\nConfederation, the States may admit the importation of slaves as long\r\nas they please; but by this article, after the year 1808 the Congress\r\nwill have power to prohibit such importation, notwithstanding the\r\ndisposition of any State to the contrary. I consider this as laying\r\nthe foundation for banishing slavery out of this country; and though\r\nthe period is more distant than I could wish, yet it will produce the\r\nsame kind, gradual change, which was pursued in Pennsylvania. It is\r\nwith much satisfaction I view this power in the general government,\r\nwhereby they may lay an interdiction on this reproachful trade; but an\r\nimmediate advantage is also obtained, for a tax or duty may be imposed\r\non such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person; and\r\nthis, sir, operates as a partial prohibition; it was all that could be\r\nobtained, I am sorry it was no more; but from this I think there is\r\nreason to hope, that yet a few years, and it will be prohibited\r\naltogether; and in the mean time, the new States which are to be\r\nformed, will be under the control of Congress in this particular; and\r\nslaves will never be introduced amongst them. The gentleman says, that\r\nit is unfortunate in another point of view; it means to prohibit the\r\nintroduction of white people from Europe, as this tax may deter them\r\nfrom coming amongst us; a little impartiality and attention will\r\ndiscover the care that the Convention took in selecting their\r\nlanguage. The words are the _migration_ or IMPORTATION of such\r\npersons, &c., shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year\r\n1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation; it is\r\nobservable here, that the term migration is dropped, when a tax or\r\nduty is mentioned, so that Congress have power to impose the tax only\r\non those imported.\r\n\r\nI recollect, on a former day, the honorable gentlemen from\r\nWestmoreland (Mr. FINDLEY,) and the honorable gentleman from\r\nCumberland (Mr. WHITEHILL,) took exception against the first clause of\r\nthe 9th section, art. 1, arguing very unfairly, that because Congress\r\nmight impose a tax or duty of ten dollars on the importation of\r\nslaves, within any of the United States, Congress might therefore\r\npermit slaves to be imported within this State, contrary to its laws.\r\nI confess I little thought that this part of the system would be\r\nexcepted to.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that it could be extended no further; but so far as it\r\noperates, it presents us with the pleasing prospect, that the rights\r\nof mankind will be acknowledged and established throughout the union.\r\n\r\nIf there was no other lovely feature in the Constitution but this one,\r\nit would diffuse a beauty over its whole countenance. Yet the lapse of\r\na few years! and Congress will have power to exterminate slavery from\r\nwithin our borders.\r\n\r\nHow would such a delightful prospect expand the breast of a benevolent\r\nand philanthropic European? Would he cavil at an expression? catch at\r\na phrase? No, sir, that is only reserved for the gentleman on the\r\nother side of your chair to do.\r\n\r\nMr. McKEAN. The arguments against the Constitution are, I think,\r\nchiefly these:....\r\n\r\nThat migration or importation of such persons, as any of the States\r\nshall admit, shall not be prohibited prior to 1808, nor a tax or duty\r\nimposed on such importation exceeding ten dollars for each person.\r\n\r\nProvision is made that Congress shall have power to prohibit the\r\nimportation of slaves after the year 1808, but the gentlemen in\r\nopposition, accuse this system of a crime, because it has not\r\nprohibited them at once. I suspect those gentlemen are not well\r\nacquainted with the business of the diplomatic body, or they would\r\nknow that an agreement might be made, that did not perfectly accord\r\nwith the will and pleasure of any one person. Instead of finding fault\r\nwith what has been gained, I am happy to see a disposition in the\r\nUnited States to do so much.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nGOV. RANDOLPH. This is one point of weakness I wish for the honor of\r\nmy countrymen that it was the only one. There is another circumstance\r\nwhich renders us more vulnerable. Are we not weakened by the\r\npopulation of those whom we hold in slavery?  The day may come when\r\nthey may make impression upon us. Gentlemen who have been long\r\naccustomed to the contemplation of the subject, think there is a cause\r\nof alarm in this case: the number of those people, compared to that of\r\nthe whites, is in an immense proportion: their number amounts to\r\n236,000--that of the whites, only to 352,000. * * * * I beseech them\r\nto consider, whether Virginia and North Carolina, both oppressed with\r\ndebts and slaves, can defend themselves externally, or make their\r\npeople happy internally.\r\n\r\nGEORGE MASON. We are told in strong language, of dangers to which we\r\nwill be exposed unless we adopt this Constitution. Among the rest,\r\ndomestic safety is said to be in danger. This government does not\r\nattend to our domestic safety. It authorizes the importation of slaves\r\nfor twenty-odd years, and thus continues upon us that nefarious trade.\r\nInstead of securing and protecting us, the continuation of this\r\ndetestable trade adds daily to our weakness. Though this evil is\r\nincreasing, there is no clause in the Constitution that will prevent\r\nthe Northern and Eastern States from meddling with our whole property\r\nof that kind. There is a clause to prohibit the importation of slaves\r\nafter twenty years, but there is no provision made for securing to the\r\nSouthern States those they now possess. It is far from being a\r\ndesirable property. But it will involve us in great difficulties and\r\ninfelicity to be now deprived of them. There ought to be a clause in\r\nthe Constitution to secure us that property, which we have acquired\r\nunder our former laws, and the loss of which would bring ruin on a\r\ngreat many people.\r\n\r\nMR. LEE. The honorable gentleman abominates it, because it does not\r\nprohibit the importation of slaves, and because it does not secure the\r\ncontinuance of the existing slavery! Is it not obviously inconsistent\r\nto criminate it for two contradictory reasons? I submit it to the\r\nconsideration of the gentleman, whether, if it be reprehensible in the\r\none case, it can be censurable in the other? MR. LEE then concluded by\r\nearnestly recommending to the committee to proceed regularly.\r\n\r\nMR. HENRY. It says that \"no state shall engage in war, unless actually\r\ninvaded.\" If you give this clause a fair construction, what is the\r\ntrue meaning of it? What does this relate to? Not domestic\r\ninsurrections, but war. If the country be invaded, a State may go to\r\nwar; but cannot suppress insurrections. If there should happen an\r\ninsurrection of slaves, the country cannot be said to be\r\ninvaded.--They cannot therefore suppress it, without the interposition\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nMR. GEORGE NICHOLAS. Another worthy member says, there is no power in\r\nthe States to quell an insurrection of slaves. Have they it now? If\r\nthey have, does the Constitution take it away? If it does, it must be\r\nin one of the three clauses which have been mentioned by the worthy\r\nmember. The first clause gives the general government power to call\r\nthem out when necessary. Does this take it away from the States? No.\r\nBut it gives an additional security: for, besides the power in the\r\nState governments to use their own militia, it will be the duty of the\r\ngeneral government to aid them with the strength of the Union when\r\ncalled for. No part of this Constitution can show that this power is\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE MASON. Mr. Chairman, this is a fatal section, which has\r\ncreated more dangers than any other. The first clause allows the\r\nimportation of slaves for twenty years. Under the royal government,\r\nthis evil was looked upon as a great oppression, and many attempts\r\nwere made to prevent it; but the interest of the African merchants\r\nprevented its prohibition. No sooner did the revolution take place,\r\nthan it was thought of. It was one of the great causes of our\r\nseparation from Great Britain. Its exclusion has been a principal\r\nobject of this State, and most of the States in the Union. The\r\naugmentation of slaves weakens the States; and such a trade is\r\ndiabolical in itself, and disgraceful to mankind. Yet, by this\r\nConstitution, it is continued for twenty years. As much as I value an\r\nunion of all the States, I would not admit the Southern States into\r\nthe Union, unless they agreed to the discontinuance of this\r\ndisgraceful trade, because it would bring weakness and not strength to\r\nthe Union. And though this infamous traffic be continued, we have no\r\nsecurity for the property of that kind which we have already. There is\r\nno clause in this Constitution to secure it; for they may lay such tax\r\nas will amount to manumission. And should the government be amended,\r\nstill this detestable kind of commerce cannot be discontinued till\r\nafter the expiration of twenty years. For the fifth article, which\r\nprovides for amendments, expressly excepts this clause. I have ever\r\nlooked upon this as a most disgraceful thing to America. I cannot\r\nexpress my detestation of it. Yet they have not secured us the\r\nproperty of the slaves we have already. So that, \"they have done what\r\nthey ought not to have done, and have left undone what they ought to\r\nhave done\"\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. Mr. Chairman, I should conceive this clause to be\r\nimpolitic, if it were one of those things which could be excluded\r\nwithout encountering greater evils. The Southern States would not have\r\nentered into the union of America, without the temporary permission of\r\nthat trade. And if they were excluded from the union, the consequences\r\nmight be dreadful to them and to us. We are not in a worse situation\r\nthan before. That traffic is prohibited by our laws, and we may\r\ncontinue the prohibition. The union in general is not in a worse\r\nsituation. Under the articles of confederation, it might be continued\r\nforever: but by this clause an end may be put to it after twenty\r\nyears. There is, therefore, an amelioration of our circumstances. A\r\ntax may be laid in the mean time; but it is limited, otherwise\r\nCongress might lay such a tax as would amount to a prohibition. From\r\nthe mode of representation and taxation, Congress cannot lay such a\r\ntax on slaves as will amount to manumission. Another clause secures us\r\nthat property which we now possess. At present, if any slave elopes to\r\nany of those States where slaves are free, he becomes emancipated by\r\ntheir laws. For the laws of the States are uncharitable to one another\r\nin this respect. But in this Constitution, \"no person held to service,\r\nor labor, in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another,\r\nshall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged\r\nfrom such service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the\r\nparty to whom such service or labor may be due.\" This clause was\r\nexpressly inserted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim them. This is\r\na better security than any that now exist. No power is given to the\r\ngeneral government to interpose with respect to the property in slaves\r\nnow held by the States. The taxation of this State being equal only to\r\nits representation, such a tax cannot be laid as he supposes. They\r\ncannot prevent the importation of slaves for twenty years: but after\r\nthat period, they can. The gentlemen from South Carolina and Georgia\r\nargued in this manner: \"We have now liberty to import this species of\r\nproperty, and much of the property now possessed, has been purchased,\r\nor otherwise acquired, in contemplation of improving it by the\r\nassistance of imported slaves. What would be the consequence of\r\nhindering us from it? The slaves of Virginia would rise in value, and\r\nwe would be obliged to go to your markets.\" I need not expatiate on\r\nthis subject. Great as the evil is, a dismemberment of the union would\r\nbe worse. If those States should disunite from the other States, for\r\nnot including them in the temporary continuance of this traffic, they\r\nmight solicit and obtain aid from foreign powers.\r\n\r\nMr. TYLER warmly enlarged on the impolicy, iniquity, and\r\ndisgracefulness of this wicked traffic. He thought the reasons urged\r\nby gentlemen in defence of it were inconclusive, and ill founded. It\r\nwas one cause of the complaints against British tyranny, that this\r\ntrade was permitted. The Revolution had put a period to it; but now it\r\nwas to be revived. He thought nothing could justify it. This temporary\r\nrestriction on Congress militated, in his opinion, against the\r\narguments of gentlemen on the other side, that what was not given up,\r\nwas retained by the States; for that if this restriction had not been\r\ninserted, Congress could have prohibited the African trade. The power\r\nof prohibiting it was not expressly delegated to them; yet they would\r\nhave had it by implication, if this restraint had not been provided.\r\nThis seemed to him to demonstrate most clearly the necessity of\r\nrestraining them by a bill of rights, from infringing our unalienable\r\nrights. It was immaterial whether the bill of rights was by itself, or\r\nincluded in the Constitution. But he contended for it one way or the\r\nother. It would be justified by our own example, and that of England.\r\nHis earnest desire was, that it should be handed down to posterity,\r\nthat he had opposed this wicked clause.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON. As to the restriction in the clause under consideration,\r\nit was a restraint on the exercise of a power expressly delegated to\r\nCongress, namely, that of regulating commerce with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY insisted, that the insertion of these restrictions on\r\nCongress, was a plain demonstration that Congress could exercise\r\npowers by implication. The gentleman had admitted that Congress could\r\nhave interdicted the African trade, were it not for this restriction.\r\nIf so, the power not having been expressly delegated, must be obtained\r\nby implication. He demanded where, then, was their doctrine of\r\nreserved rights? He wished for negative clauses to prevent them from\r\nassuming any powers but those expressly given. He asked why it was\r\nmoited to secure us that property in slaves, which we held now? He\r\nfeared its omission was done with design. They might lay such heavy\r\ntaxes on slaves, as would amount to emancipation; and then the\r\nSouthern States would be the only sufferers. His opinion was confirmed\r\nby the mode of levying money. Congress, he observed, had power to lay\r\nand collect taxes, imposts, and excises. Imposts (or duties) and\r\nexcises, were to be uniform. But this uniformity did not extend to\r\ntaxes. This might compel the Southern States to liberate their\r\nnegroes. He wished this property therefore to be guarded. He\r\nconsidered the clause which had been adduced by the gentleman as a\r\nsecurity for this property, as no security at all. It was no more than\r\nthis--that a runaway negro could be taken up in Maryland or New York.\r\nThis could not prevent Congress from interfering with that property by\r\nlaying a grievous and enormous tax on it, so as to compel owners to\r\nemancipate their slaves rather than pay the tax. He apprehended it\r\nwould be productive of much stockjobbing, and that they would play\r\ninto one another's hands in such a manner as that this property would\r\nbe lost to the country.\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE NICHOLAS wondered that gentlemen who were against slavery\r\nwould be opposed to this clause; as after that period the slave trade\r\nwould be done away. He asked if gentlemen did not see the\r\ninconsistency of their arguments? They object, says he, to the\r\nConstitution, because the slave trade is laid open for twenty-odd\r\nyears; and yet tell you, that by some latent operation of it, the\r\nslaves who are now, will be manumitted. At that same moment, it is\r\nopposed for being promotive and destructive of slavery. He contended\r\nthat it was advantageous to Virginia, that it should be in the power\r\nof Congress to prevent the importation of slaves after twenty years,\r\nas it would then put a period to the evil complained of.\r\n\r\nAs the Southern States would not confederate without this clause, he\r\nasked, if gentlemen would rather dissolve the confederacy than to\r\nsuffer this temporary inconvenience, admitting to it to be such?\r\nVirginia might continue the prohibition of such importation during the\r\nintermediate period, and would be benefitted by it, as a tax of ten\r\ndollars on each slave might be laid, of which she would receive a\r\nshare. He endeavored to obviate the objection of gentlemen, that the\r\nrestriction on Congress was a proof that they would have power not\r\ngiven them, by remarking, that they would only have had a general\r\nsuperintendency of trade, if the restriction had not been inserted.\r\nBut the Southern States insisted on this exception to that general\r\nsuperintendency for twenty years. It could not therefore have been a\r\npower by implication, as the restriction was an exception from a\r\ndelegated power. The taxes could not, as had been suggested, be laid\r\nso high on negroes as to amount to emancipation; because taxation and\r\nrepresentation were fixed according to the census established in the\r\nConstitution. The exception of taxes, from the uniformity annexed to\r\nduties and excises, could not have the operation contended for by the\r\ngentleman; because other clauses had clearly and positively fixed the\r\ncensus. Had taxes been uniform, it would have been universally\r\nobjected to, for no one object could be selected without involving\r\ngreat inconveniences and oppressions. But, says Mr. Nicholas, is it\r\nfrom the general government we are to fear emancipation? Gentlemen\r\nwill recollect what I said in another house, and what other gentlemen\r\nhave said that advocated emancipation. Give me leave to say, that that\r\nclause is a great security for our slave tax. I can tell the\r\ncommittee, that the people of our country are reduced to beggary by\r\nthe taxes on negroes. Had this Constitution been adopted, it would not\r\nhave been the case. The taxes were laid on all our negroes. By this\r\nsystem two-fifths are exempted. He then added, that he had imagined\r\ngentlemen would not support here what they had opposed in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY replied, that though the proportion of each was to be fixed\r\nby the census, and three-fifths of the slaves only were included in\r\nthe enumeration, yet the proportion of Virginia being once fixed,\r\nmight be laid on blacks and blacks only. For the mode of raising the\r\nproportion of each State being to be directed by Congress, they might\r\nmake slaves the sole object to raise it. Personalities he wished to\r\ntake leave of; they had nothing to do with the question, which was\r\nsolely whether that paper was wrong or not.\r\n\r\nMr. NICHOLAS replied, that negroes must be considered as persons, or\r\nproperty. If as property, the proportion of taxes to be laid on them\r\nwas fixed in the Constitution. If he apprehended a poll tax on\r\nnegroes, the Constitution had prevented it. For, by the census, where\r\na white man paid ten shillings, a negro paid but six shillings. For\r\nthe exemption of two-fifths of them reduced it to that proportion.\r\n\r\nThe second, third, and fourth clauses, were then read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,\r\nunless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may\r\nrequire it.\r\n\r\nNo bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.\r\n\r\nNo capitation or other direct tax shall be paid, unless in proportion\r\nto the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE MASON said, that gentlemen might think themselves secured\r\nby the restriction in the fourth clause, that no capitation or other\r\ndirect tax should be laid but in proportion to the census before\r\ndirected to be taken. But that when maturely considered it would be\r\nfound to be no security whatsoever. It was nothing but a direct\r\nassertion, or mere confirmation of the clause which fixed the ratio of\r\ntaxes and representation. It only meant that the quantum to be raised\r\nof each State should be in proportion to their numbers in the manner\r\ntherein directed. But the general government was not precluded from\r\nlaying the proportion of any particular State on any one species of\r\nproperty they might think proper. For instance, if five hundred\r\nthousand dollars were to be raised, they might lay the whole of the\r\nproportion of the Southern States on the blacks, or any one species of\r\nproperty: so that by laying taxes too heavily on slaves, they might\r\ntotally annihilate that kind of property. No real security could arise\r\nfrom the clause which provides, that persons held to labor in one\r\nState, escaping into another, shall be delivered up. This only meant,\r\nthat runaway slaves should not be protected in other States. As to the\r\nexclusion of _ex post facto_ laws, it could not be said to create any\r\nsecurity in this case. For laying a tax on slaves would not be _ex\r\npost facto_.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON replied, that even the Southern States, who were most\r\naffected, were perfectly satisfied with this provision, and dreaded no\r\ndanger to the property they now hold. It appeared to him, that the\r\ngeneral government would not intermeddle with that property for twenty\r\nyears, but to lay a tax on every slave imported, not exceeding ten\r\ndollars; and that after the expiration of that period they might\r\nprohibit the traffic altogether. The census in the Constitution was\r\nintended to introduce equality in the burdens to be laid on the\r\ncommunity. No gentleman objected to laying duties, imposts, and\r\nexcises, uniformly. But uniformity of taxes would be subversive to the\r\nprinciples of equality: for that it was not possible to select any\r\narticle which would be easy for one State, but what would be heavy for\r\nanother. That the proportion of each State being ascertained, it would\r\nbe raised by the general government in the most convenient manner for\r\nthe people, and not by the selection of any one particular object.\r\nThat there must be some degree of confidence put in agents, or else we\r\nmust reject a state of civil society altogether. Another great\r\nsecurity to this property, which he mentioned, was, that five States\r\nwere greatly interested in that species of property, and there were\r\nother States which had some slaves, and had made no attempt, or taken\r\nany step to take them from the people. There were a few slaves in New\r\nYork, New Jersey and Connecticut: these States would, probably, oppose\r\nany attempts to annihilate this species of property. He concluded, by\r\nobserving, that he would be glad to leave the decision of this to the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe second section was then read as follows:     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNo person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws\r\nthereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein be discharged from such service.\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE MASON.--Mr. Chairman, on some former part of the\r\ninvestigation of this subject, gentlemen were pleased to make some\r\nobservations on the security of property coming within this section.\r\nIt was then said, and I now say, that there is no security, nor have\r\ngentlemen convinced me of this.\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY. Among ten thousand implied powers which they may assume,\r\nthey may, if we be engaged in war, liberate every one of your slaves\r\nif they please. And this must and will be done by men, a majority of\r\nwhom have not a common interest with you. They will, therefore, have\r\nno feeling for your interests. It has been repeatedly said here, that\r\nthe great object of a national government, was national defence. That\r\npower which is said to be intended for security and safety, may be\r\nrendered detestable and oppressive. If you give power to the general\r\ngovernment to provide for the general defence, the means must be\r\ncommensurate to the end. All the means in the possession of the people\r\nmust be given to the government which is entrusted with the public\r\ndefence. In this State there are 236,000 blacks, and there are many in\r\nseveral other States. But there are few or none in the Northern\r\nStates, and yet if the Northern States shall be of opinion, that our\r\nnumbers are numberless, they may call forth every national resource.\r\nMay Congress not say, that every black man must fight? Did we not see\r\na little of this last war? We were not so hard pushed, as to make\r\nemancipation general. But acts of assembly passed, that every slave\r\nwho would go to the army should be free. Another thing will contribute\r\nto bring this event about--slavery is detested--we feel its fatal\r\neffects--we deplore it with all the pity of humanity. Let all these\r\nconsiderations, at some future period, press with full force on the\r\nminds of Congress. Let that urbanity, which I trust will distinguish\r\nAmerica, and the necessity of national defence, let all these things\r\noperate on their minds, they will search that paper, and see if they\r\nhave power of manumission. And have they not, sir? Have they not power\r\nto provide for the general defence and welfare? May they not think\r\nthat these call for the abolition of slavery? May not they pronounce\r\nall slaves free, and will they not be warranted by that power? There\r\nis no ambiguous implication or logical deduction. The paper speaks to\r\nthe point. They have the power in clear, unequivocal terms; and will\r\nclearly and certainly exercise it. As much as I deplore slavery, I see\r\nthat prudence forbids its abolition. I deny that the general\r\ngovernment ought to set them free, because a decided majority of the\r\nStates have not the ties of sympathy and fellow-feeling for those\r\nwhose interest would be affected by their emancipation. The majority\r\nof Congress is to the North, and the slaves are to the South. In this\r\nsituation, I see a great deal of the property of the people of\r\nVirginia in jeopardy, and their peace and tranquillity gone away. I\r\nrepeat it again, that it would rejoice my very soul, that every one of\r\nmy fellow-beings was emancipated. As we ought with gratitude to admire\r\nto admire that decree of Heaven, which has numbered us among the free,\r\nwe ought to lament and deplore the necessity of holding our fellow-men\r\nin bondage. But is it practicable by any human means, to liberate\r\nthem, without producing the most dreadful and ruinous consequences? We\r\nought to possess them in the manner we have inherited them from our\r\nancestors, as their manumission is incompatible with the felicity of\r\nthe country. But we ought to soften, as much as possible, the rigor of\r\ntheir unhappy fate. I know that in a variety of particular instances,\r\nthe legislature, listening to complaints, have admitted their\r\nemancipation. Let me not dwell on this subject. I will only add, that\r\nthis, as well as every other property of the people of Virginia, is in\r\njeopardy, and put in the hands of those who have no similarity of\r\nsituation with us. This is a local matter, and I can see no propriety\r\nin subjecting it to Congress.\r\n\r\nHave we not a right to say, _hear our propositions_? Why, sir, your\r\nslaves have a right to make their humble requests.--Those who are in\r\nthe meanest occupations of human life, have a right to complain.\r\n\r\nGov. RANDOLPH. That honorable gentleman, and some others, have\r\ninsisted that the abolition of slavery will result from it, and at the\r\nsame time have complained, that it encourages its continuation. The\r\ninconsistency proves in some degree, the futility of their arguments.\r\nBut if it be not conclusive, to satisfy the committee that there is no\r\ndanger of enfranchisement taking place, I beg leave to refer them to\r\nthe paper itself. I hope that there is none here, who, considering the\r\nsubject in the calm light of philosophy, will advance an objection\r\ndishonorable to Virginia; that at the moment they are securing the\r\nrights of their citizens, an objection is started that there is a\r\nspark of hope, that those unfortunate men now held in bondage, may, by\r\nthe operation of the general government be made _free_. But if any\r\ngentleman be terrified by this apprehension, let him read the system.\r\nI ask, and I will ask again and again, till I be answered (not by\r\ndeclamation) where is the part that has a tendency to the abolition of\r\nslavery? Is it the clause which says, that \"the migration or\r\nimportation of such persons as any of the States now existing, shall\r\nthink proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to\r\nthe year 1808?\" This is an exception from the power of regulating\r\ncommerce, and the restriction is only to continue till 1808. Then\r\nCongress can, by the exercise of that power, prevent future\r\nimportations; but does it affect the existing state of slavery? Were\r\nit right here to mention what passed in Convention on the occasion, I\r\nmight tell you that the Southern States, even South Carolina herself;\r\nconceived this property to be secure by these words. I believe,\r\nwhatever we may think here, that there was not a member of the\r\nVirginia delegation who had the smallest suspicion of the abolition of\r\nslavery. Go to their meaning. Point out the clause where this\r\nformidable power of emancipation is inserted. But another clause of\r\nthe Constitution proves the absurdity of the supposition. The words of\r\nthe clause are, \"No person held to service or labor in one State,\r\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence\r\nof any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or\r\nlabor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\r\nservice or labor may be due.\" Every one knows that slaves are held to\r\nservice and labor. And when authority is given to owners of slaves to\r\nvindicate their property, can it be supposed they can be deprived of\r\nit? If a citizen of this State, in consequence of this clause, can\r\ntake his runaway slave in Maryland, can it be seriously thought, that\r\nafter taking him and bringing him home, he could be made free?\r\n\r\nI observed that the honorable gentleman's proposition comes in a truly\r\nquestionable shape, and is still more extraordinary and unaccountable\r\nfor another consideration; that although we went article by article\r\nthrough the Constitution, and although we did not expect a general\r\nreview of the subject, (as a most comprehensive view had been taken of\r\nit before it was regularly debated,) yet we are carried back to the\r\nclause giving that dreadful power, for the general welfare. Pardon me\r\nif I remind you of the true state of that business. I appeal to the\r\ncandor of the honorable gentleman, and if he thinks it an improper\r\nappeal, I ask the gentlemen here, whether there be a general\r\nindefinite power of providing for the general welfare? The power is,\r\n\"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the\r\ndebts and provide for the common defence and general welfare.\" So that\r\nthey can only raise money by these means, in order to provide for the\r\ngeneral welfare. No man who reads it can say it is general as the\r\nhonorable gentleman represents it. You must violate every rule of\r\nconstruction and common sense, if you sever it from the power of\r\nraising money and annex it to any thing else, in order to make it that\r\nformidable power which it is represented to be.\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE MASON. Mr. Chairman, with respect to commerce and\r\nnavigation, he has given it as his opinion, that their regulation, as\r\nit now stands, was a _sine qua non_ of the Union, and that without it,\r\nthe States in Convention would never concur. I differ from him. It\r\nnever was, nor in my opinion ever will be, a _sine qua non_ of the\r\nUnion. I will give you, to the best of my recollection, the history of\r\nthat affair. This business was discussed at Philadelphia for four\r\nmonths, during which time the subject of commerce and navigation was\r\noften under consideration; and I assert, that eight States out of\r\ntwelve, for more than three months, voted for requiring two-thirds of\r\nthe members present in each house to pass commercial and navigation\r\nlaws. True it is, that afterwards it was carried by a majority, as it\r\nstands. If I am right, there was a great majority for requiring\r\ntwo-thirds of the States in this business, till a compromise took\r\nplace between the Northern and Southern States; the Northern States\r\nagreeing to the temporary importation of slaves, and the Southern\r\nStates conceding, in return, that navigation and commercial laws\r\nshould be on the footing on which they now stand. If I am mistaken,\r\nlet me be put right. These are my reasons for saying that this was not\r\na _sine qua non_ of their concurrence. The Newfoundland fisheries will\r\nrequire that kind of security which we are now in want of. The Eastern\r\nStates therefore agreed at length, that treaties should require the\r\nconsent of two-thirds of the members present in the senate.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison. I was struck with surprise when I heard him express\r\nhimself alarmed with respect to the emancipation of slaves. Let me\r\nask, if they should even attempt it, if it will not be an usurpation\r\nof power? There is no power to warrant it, in that paper. If there be,\r\nI know it not. But why should it be done? Says the honorable\r\ngentleman, for the general welfare--it will infuse strength into our\r\nsystem. Can any member of this committee suppose, that it will\r\nincrease our strength? Can any one believe, that the American councils\r\nwill come into a measure which will strip them of their property,\r\ndiscourage and alienate the affections of five-thirteenths of the\r\nUnion? Why was nothing of this sort aimed at before? I believe such an\r\nidea never entered into an American breast, nor do I believe it ever\r\nwill, unless it will enter into the heads of those gentlemen who\r\nsubstitute unsupported suspicions for reasons.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry. He asked me where was the power of emancipating slaves? I\r\nsay it will be implied, unless implication be prohibited. He admits\r\nthat the power of granting passports will be in the new Congress\r\nwithout the insertion of this restriction--yet he can shew me nothing\r\nlike such a power granted in that Constitution. Notwithstanding he\r\nadmits their right to this power by implication, he says that I am\r\nunfair and uncandid in my deduction, that they can emancipate our\r\nslaves, though the word emancipation be not mentioned in it. They can\r\nexercise power by implication in one instance, as well as in another.\r\nThus, by the gentleman's own argument, they can exercise the power\r\nthough it be not delegated.\r\n\r\nMr. Z. Johnson. They tell us that they see a progressive danger of\r\nbringing about emancipation. The principle has begun since the\r\nrevolution. Let us do what we will, it will come round. Slavery has\r\nbeen the foundation of that impiety and dissipation, which have been\r\nso much disseminated among our countrymen. If it were totally\r\nabolished, it would do much good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe first three clauses of the second section read.\r\n\r\nMr. GOUDY. Mr. Chairman, this clause of taxation will give an\r\nadvantage to some States, over the others. It will be oppressive to\r\nthe Southern States. Taxes are equal to our representation. To augment\r\nour taxes and increase our burthens, our negroes are to be\r\nrepresented. If a State has fifty thousand negroes, she is to send one\r\nrepresentative for them. I wish not to be represented with negroes,\r\nespecially if it increases my burthens.\r\n\r\nMr. Davie. Mr. Chairman, I will endeavor to obviate what the gentleman\r\nlast up has said. I wonder to see gentlemen so precipitate and hasty\r\non a subject of such awful importance. It ought to be considered, that\r\n_some_ of _us_ are slow of apprehension, not having those quick\r\nconceptions, and luminous understandings, of which other gentlemen may\r\nbe possessed. The gentleman \"does not wish to be represented with\r\nnegroes.\" This, sir, is an unhappy species of population, but cannot\r\nat present alter their situation. The Eastern States had great\r\njealousies on this subject. They insisted that their cows and horses\r\nwere equally entitled to representation; that the one was property as\r\nwell as the other. It became our duty on the other hand, to acquire as\r\nmuch weight as possible in the legislation of the Union; and as the\r\nNorthern States were more populous in whites, this only could be done\r\nby insisting that a certain proportion of our slaves should make a\r\npart of the computed population. It was attempted to form a rule of\r\nrepresentation from a compound ratio of wealth and population; but, on\r\nconsideration, it was found impracticable to determine the comparative\r\nvalue of lands, and other property, in so extensive a territory, with\r\nany degree of accuracy; and population alone was adopted as the only\r\npracticable rule or criterion of representation. It was urged by the\r\ndeputies of the Eastern States, that a representation of two-fifths\r\nwould of little utility, and that their entire representation would be\r\nunequal and burthensome. That in a time of war, slaves rendered a\r\ncountry more vulnerable, while its defence devolved upon its _free_\r\ninhabitants. On the other hand, we insisted, that in time of peace\r\nthey contributed by their labor to the general wealth as well as other\r\nmembers of the community. That as rational beings they had a right of\r\nrepresentation, and in some instances might be highly useful in war.\r\nOn these principles, the Eastern States gave the matter up, and\r\nconsented to the regulation as it has been read. I hope these reasons\r\nwill appear satisfactory. It is the same rule or principle which was\r\nproposed some years ago by Congress, and assented to by twelve of the\r\nStates. It may wound the delicacy of the gentleman from Guilford, (Mr.\r\nGOUDY,) but I hope he will endeavor to accommodate his feelings to the\r\ninterests and circumstances of his country.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES GALLOWAY said, that he did not object to the representation\r\nof negroes, so much as he did to the fewness of the number of\r\nrepresentatives. He was surprised how we came to have but five,\r\nincluding those intended to represent negroes. That in his humble\r\nopinion North Carolina was entitled to that number independent of the\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\nFirst clause of the 9th section read.\r\n\r\nMr. J. M'DOWALL wished to hear the reasons of this restriction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPAIGHT answered that there was a contest between the Northern and\r\nSouthern States--that the Southern States, whose principal support\r\ndepended on the labor of slaves, would not consent to the desire of\r\nthe Northern States to exclude the importation of slaves absolutely.\r\nThat South Carolina and Georgia insisted on this clause, as they were\r\nnow in want of hands to cultivate their lands: That in the course of\r\ntwenty years they would be fully supplied: That the trade would be\r\nabolished then, and that in the mean time some tax or duty might be\r\nlaid on.\r\n\r\nMr. M'DOWALL replied, that the explanation was just such as he\r\nexpected, and by no means satisfactory to him, and that he looked upon\r\nit as a very objectionable part of the system.\r\n\r\nMr. IREDELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express sentiments similar to\r\nthose of the gentleman from Craven. For my part, were it practicable\r\nto put an end to the importation of slaves immediately, it would give\r\nme the greatest pleasure, for it certainly is a trade utterly\r\ninconsistent with the rights of humanity, and under which great\r\ncruelties have been exercised. When the entire abolition of slavery\r\ntakes place, it will be an event which must be pleasing to every\r\ngenerous mind, and every friend of human nature; but we often wish for\r\nthings which are not attainable. It was the wish of a great majority\r\nof the Convention to put an end to the trade immediately, but the\r\nStates of South Carolina and Georgia would not agree to it. Consider\r\nthen what would be the difference between our present situation in\r\nthis respect, if we do not agree to the Constitution, and what it will\r\nbe if we do agree to it. If we do not agree to it, do we remedy the\r\nevil? No, sir, we do not; for if the Constitution be not adopted, it\r\nwill be in the power of every State to continue it forever. They may\r\nor may not abolish it at their discretion. But if we adopt the\r\nConstitution, the trade must cease after twenty years, if Congress\r\ndeclare so, whether particular States please so or not: surely, then,\r\nwe gain by it. This was the utmost that could be obtained. I heartily\r\nwish more could have been done. But as it is, this government is nobly\r\ndistinguished above others by that very provision. Where is there\r\nanother country in which such a restriction prevails? We, therefore,\r\nsir, set an example of humanity by providing for the abolition of this\r\ninhuman traffic, though at a distant period. I hope, therefore, that\r\nthis part of the Constitution will not be condemned, because it has\r\nnot stipulated for what it was impracticable to obtain.\r\n\r\nMr. SPAIGHT further explained the clause. That the limitation of this\r\ntrade to the term of twenty years, was a compromise between the\r\nEastern States and the Southern States. South Carolina and Georgia\r\nwished to extend the term. The Eastern States insisted on the entire\r\nabolition of the trade. That the State of North Carolina had not\r\nthought proper to pass any law prohibiting the importation of slaves,\r\nand therefore its delegation in the convention did not think\r\nthemselves authorized to contend for an immediate prohibition of it.\r\n\r\nMr. IREDELL added to what he had said before, that the States of\r\nGeorgia and South Carolina had lost a great many slaves during the\r\nwar, and that they wished to supply the loss.\r\n\r\nMr. GALLOWAY. Mr. Chairman, the explanation given to this clause does\r\nnot satisfy my mind. I wish to see this abominable trade put an end\r\nto. But in case it be thought proper to continue this abominable\r\ntraffic for twenty years, yet I do not wish to see the tax on the\r\nimportation extended to all persons whatsoever. Our situation is\r\ndifferent from the people to the North. We want citizens; they do not.\r\nInstead of laying a tax, we ought to a give a bounty, to encourage\r\nforeigners to come among us. With respect to the abolition of slavery,\r\nit requires the utmost consideration. The property of the Southern\r\nStates consists principally of slaves. If they mean to do away slavery\r\naltogether, this property will be destroyed. I apprehend it means to\r\nbring forward manumission. If we must manumit our slaves, what country\r\nshall we send them to? It is impossible for us to be happy if, after\r\nmanumission, they are to stay among us.\r\n\r\nMr. IREDELL. Mr. Chairman, the worthy gentleman, I believe, has\r\nmisunderstood this clause, which runs in the following words: \"The\r\nmigration or importation of such persons as any of the States now\r\nexisting, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the\r\nCongress prior to the year 1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed on\r\n_such importation_, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\"\r\n\r\nNow, sir, observe that the Eastern States, who long ago have abolished\r\nslavery, did not approve of the expression _slaves_; they therefore\r\nused another that answered the same purpose. The committee will\r\nobserve the distinction between the two words migration and\r\nimportation. The first part of the clause will extend to persons who\r\ncome into the country as free people, or are brought as slaves, but\r\nthe last part extends to slaves only. The word _migration_ refers to\r\nfree persons; but the word _importation_ refers to slaves, because\r\nfree people cannot be said to be imported. The tax, therefore, is only\r\nto be laid on slaves who are imported, and not on free persons who\r\nmigrate. I further beg leave to say, that the gentleman is mistaken in\r\nanother thing. He seems to say that this extends to the abolition of\r\nslavery. Is there anything in this constitution which says that\r\nCongress shall have it in their power to abolish the slavery of those\r\nslaves who are now in the country? Is it not the plain meaning of it,\r\nthat after twenty years they may prevent the future importation of\r\nslaves? It does not extend to those now in the country. There is\r\nanother circumstance to be observed. There is no authority vested in\r\ncongress to restrain the States in the interval of twenty years, from\r\ndoing what they please. If they wish to inhibit such importation, they\r\nmay do so. Our next assembly may put an entire end to the importation\r\nof slaves.\r\n\r\nArticle fourth. The first section and two first clauses of the second\r\nsection read without observation.\r\n\r\nThe last clause read--\r\n\r\nMr. IREDELL begged leave to explain the reason of this clause. In some\r\nof the Northern States, they have emancipated all their slaves. If any\r\nof our slaves, said he, go there and remain there a certain time, they\r\nwould, by the present laws, be entitled to their freedom, so that\r\ntheir masters could not get them again. This would be extremely\r\nprejudicial to the inhabitants of the Southern States, and to prevent\r\nit, this clause is inserted in the Constitution. Though the word\r\n_slave_ be not mentioned, this is the meaning of it. The Northern\r\ndelegates, owing to their particular scruples on the subject of\r\nslavery, did not choose the word _slave_ to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the forth article read without observation.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. IREDELL. It is however to be observed, that the first and forth\r\nclauses in the ninth section of the first article, are protected from\r\nany alteration until the year 1808; and in order that no consolidation\r\nshould take place, it is provided, that no State shall, by any\r\namendment or alteration, be ever deprived of an equal suffrage in the\r\nSenate without its own consent. The two first prohibitions are with\r\nrespect to the census, according to which direct taxes are imposed,\r\nand with respect to the importation of slaves. As to the first, it\r\nmust be observed, that there is a material difference between the\r\nNorthern and Southern States. The Northern States have been much\r\nlonger settled, and are much fuller of people than the Southern, but\r\nhave not land in equal proportion, nor scarcely any slaves. The\r\nsubject of this article was regulated with great difficulty, and by a\r\nspirit of concession which it would not be prudent to disturb for a\r\ngood many years. In twenty years there will probably be a great\r\nalteration, and then the subject may be re-considered with less\r\ndifficulty and greater coolness. In the mean time, the compromise was\r\nupon the best footing that could be obtained. A compromise likewise\r\ntook place in regard to the importation of slaves. It is probable that\r\nall the members reprobated this inhuman traffic, but those of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia would not consent to an immediate prohibition of\r\nit; one reason of which was, that during the last war they lost a vast\r\nnumber of negroes, which loss they wish to supply. In the mean time,\r\nit is left to the States to admit or prohibit the importation, and\r\nCongress may impose a limited duty upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nHon. RAWLINS LOWNDES. In the first place, what cause was there for\r\njealously of our importing negroes? Why confine us to twenty years, or\r\nrather why limit us at all? For his part he thought this trade could\r\nbe justified on the principles of religion, humanity, and justice; for\r\ncertainly to translate a set of human beings from a bad country to a\r\nbetter, was fulfilling every part of these principles. But they don't\r\nlike our slaves, because they have none themselves; and therefore want\r\nto exclude us from this great advantage; why should the Southern\r\nStates allow of this, without the consent of nine States?\r\n\r\nJudge PENDLETON observed, that only three States, Georgia, South\r\nCarolina, and North Carolina, allowed the importation of negroes.\r\nVirginia had a clause in her Constitution for this purpose, and\r\nMaryland, he believed, even before the war, prohibited them.\r\n\r\nMr. LOWNDES continued--that we had a law prohibiting the importation\r\nof negroes for three years, a law he greatly approved of; but there\r\nwas no reason offered, why the Southern States might not find it\r\nnecessary to alter their conduct, and open their ports. Without\r\nnegroes this State would degenerate into one of the most contemptible\r\nin the Union; and cited an expression that fell from Gen. PINCKNEY on\r\na former debate, that whilst there remained one acre of swamp land in\r\nSouth Carolina he should raise his voice against restricting the\r\nimportation of negroes. Even in granting the importation for twenty\r\nyears, care had been taken to make us pay for this indulgence, each\r\nnegro being liable, on importation, to pay a duty not exceeding ten\r\ndollars, and, in addition to this, were liable to a capitation tax.\r\nNegroes were our wealth, our only natural resource; yet behold how our\r\nkind friends in the North were determined soon to tie up our hands,\r\nand drain us of what we had. The Eastern States drew their means of\r\nsubsistence, in a great measure, from their shipping; and on that\r\nhead, they had been particularly careful not to allow of any burdens;\r\nthey were not to pay tonnage, or duties; no, not even the form of\r\nclearing out: all ports were free and open to them! Why, then, call\r\nthis a reciprocal bargain, which took all from one party, to bestow it\r\non the other?\r\n\r\nMajor BUTLER observed that they were to pay a five per cent impost.\r\nThis, Mr. LOWNDES proved, must fall upon the consumer. They are to be\r\nthe carriers; and we, being the consumers, therefore all expenses\r\nwould fall upon us.\r\n\r\nHon. E. RUTLEDGE. The gentleman had complained of the inequality of\r\nthe taxes between the Northern and Southern States--that ten dollars a\r\nhead was imposed on the importation of negroes, and that those negroes\r\nwere afterwards taxed. To this it was answered, that the ten dollars\r\nper head was an equivalent to the five per cent on imported articles;\r\nand as to their being afterwards taxed, the advantage is on our side;\r\nor, at least, not against us.\r\n\r\nIn the Northern States, the labor is performed by white people; in the\r\nSouthern by black. All the free people (and there are few others) in\r\nthe Northern States, are to be taxed by the new Constitution, whereas,\r\nonly the free people, and two-fifths of the slaves in the Southern\r\nStates are to be rated in the apportioning of taxes. But the principle\r\n objection is, that no duties are laid on shipping--that in fact the\r\ncarrying trade was to be vested in a great measure in the Americans;\r\nthat the shipbuilding business was principally carried on in the\r\nNorthern States. When this subject is duly considered, the Southern\r\nStates, should be the last to object to it. Mr. RUTLEDGE then went\r\ninto a consideration of the subject; after which the house adjourned.\r\n\r\nGen. CHARLES COTESWORTH PINCKNEY. We were at a loss for some time for\r\na role to ascertain the proportionate wealth of the States, at last we\r\nthought that the productive labor of the inhabitants was the best rule\r\nfor ascertaining their wealth; in conformity to this rule, joined to\r\na spirit of concession, we determined that representatives should be\r\napportioned among the several States, by adding to the whole number of\r\nfree persons three-fifths of the slaves. We thus obtained a\r\nrepresentation for our property, and I confess I did not expect that\r\nwe had conceded too much to the Eastern States, when they allowed us a\r\nrepresentation for a species of property which they have not among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe honorable gentleman alleges, that the Southern States are weak, I\r\nsincerely agree with him--we are so weak that by ourselves we could\r\nnot form an union strong enough for the purpose of effectually\r\nprotecting each other. Without union with the other States, South\r\nCarolina must soon fall. Is there any one among us so much a Quixotte\r\nas to suppose that this State could long maintain her independence if\r\nshe stood alone, or was only connected with the Southern States? I\r\nscarcely believe there is. Let an invading power send a naval force\r\ninto the Chesapeake to keep Virginia in alarm, and attack South\r\nCarolina with such a naval and military force as Sir Henry Clinton\r\nbrought here in 1780, and though they might not soon conquer us, they\r\nwould certainly do us an infinite deal of mischief; and if they\r\nconsiderably increased their numbers, we should probably fall. As,\r\nfrom the nature of our climate, and the fewness of our inhabitants, we\r\nare undoubtedly weak, should we not endeavor to form a close union\r\nwith the Eastern States, who are strong?\r\n\r\nFor who have been the greatest sufferers in the Union, by our\r\nobtaining our independence? I answer, the Eastern States; they have\r\nlost every thing but their country, and their freedom. It is notorious\r\nthat some ports to the Eastward, which used to fit out one hundred and\r\nfifty sail of vessels, do not now fit out thirty; that their trade of\r\nship-building, which used to be very considerable, is now annihilated;\r\nthat their fisheries are trifling, and their mariners in want of\r\nbread; surely we are called upon by every tie of justice, friendship,\r\nand humanity, to relieve their distresses; and as by their exertions\r\nthey have assisted us in establishing our freedom, we should let them,\r\nin some measure, partake of our prosperity. The General then said he\r\nwould make a few observations on the objections which the gentleman\r\nhad thrown out on the restrictions that might be laid on the African\r\ntrade after the year 1808. On this point your delegates had to contend\r\nwith the religious and political prejudices of the Eastern and Middle\r\nStates, and with the interested and inconsistent opinion of Virginia,\r\nwho was warmly opposed to our importing more slaves. I am of the same\r\nopinion now as I was two years ago, when I used the expressions that\r\nthe gentleman has quoted, that while there remained one acre of swamp\r\nland uncleared of South Carolina, I would raise my voice against\r\nrestricting the importation of negroes. I am as thoroughly convinced\r\nas that gentleman is, that the nature of our climate, and the flat,\r\nswampy situation of our country, obliges us to cultivate our land with\r\nnegroes, and that without them South Carolina would soon be a desert\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nYou have so frequently heard my sentiments on this subject that I need\r\nnot now repeat them. It was alleged, by some of the members who\r\nopposed an unlimited importation, that slaves increased the weakness\r\nof any State who admitted them; that they were a dangerous species of\r\nproperty, which an invading enemy could easily turn against ourselves\r\nand the neighboring States, and that as we were allowed a\r\nrepresentation for them in the House of Representatives, our influence\r\nin government would be increased in proportion as we were less able to\r\ndefend ourselves. \"Show some period,\" said the members from the\r\nEastern States, \"when it may be in our power to put a stop, if we\r\nplease, to the importation of this weakness, and we will endeavor, for\r\nyour convenience, to restrain the religious and political prejudices\r\nof our people on this subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe Middle States and Virginia made us no such proposition; they were\r\nfor an immediate and total prohibition. We endeavored to obviate the\r\nobjections that were made, in the best manner we could, and assigned\r\nreasons for our insisting on the importation, which there is no\r\noccasion to repeat, as they must occur to every gentleman in the\r\nhouse: a committee of the States was appointed in order to accommodate\r\nthis matter, and after a great deal of difficulty, it was settled on\r\nthe footing recited in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBy this settlement we have secured an unlimited importation of negroes\r\nfor twenty years; nor is it declared that the importation shall be\r\nthen stopped; it may be continued--we have a security that the general\r\ngovernment can never emancipate them, for no such authority is\r\ngranted, and it is admitted on all hands, that the general government\r\nhas no powers but what are expressly granted by the Constitution; and\r\nthat all rights not expressed were reserved by the several States. We\r\nhave obtained a right to recover our slaves, in whatever part of\r\nAmerica they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before. In\r\nshort, considering all circumstances, we have made the best terms, for\r\nthe security of this species of property, it was in our power to make.\r\nWe would have made better if we could, but on the whole I do not think\r\nthem bad.\r\n\r\nHon. ROBERT BARNWELL. Mr. BARNWELL continued to say, I now come to the\r\nlast point for consideration, I mean the clause relative to the\r\nnegroes; and here I am particularly pleased with the Constitution; it\r\nhas not left this matter of so much importance to us open to immediate\r\ninvestigation; no, it has declared that the United States shall not,\r\nat any rate, consider this matter for twenty-one years, and yet\r\ngentlemen are displeased with it.\r\n\r\nCongress has guaranteed this right for that space of time, and at its\r\nexpiration may continue it as long as they please. This question then\r\narises, what will their interest lead them to do? The Eastern States,\r\nas the honorable gentleman says, will become the carriers of America,\r\nit will, therefore, certainly be their interest to encourage\r\nexportation to as great an extent as possible; and if the quantum of\r\nour products will be diminished by the prohibition of negroes, I\r\nappeal to the belief of every man, whether he thinks those very\r\ncarriers will themselves dam up the resources from whence their profit\r\nis derived? To think so is so contradictory to the general conduct of\r\nmankind, that I am of opinion, that without we ourselves put a stop to\r\nthem, the traffic for negroes will continue forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST, No. 42\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nIt were doubtless to be wished, that the power of prohibiting the\r\nimportation of slaves, had not been postponed until the year 1808, or\r\nrather that it had been suffered to have immediate operation. But it\r\nis not difficult to account either for this restriction on the general\r\ngovernment, or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of\r\nhumanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate for ever within\r\nthese States, a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the\r\nbarbarism of modern policy; that within that period, it will receive a\r\nconsiderable discouragement from the Federal government, and may be\r\ntotally abolished, by a concurrence of the few States which continue\r\nthe unnatural traffic in the prohibitory example which has been given\r\nby so great a majority of the Union. Happy would it be for the\r\nunfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before them, of being\r\nredeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren! Attempts\r\nhave been made to pervert this clause into an objection against the\r\nConstitution, by representing it on one side, as a criminal toleration\r\nof an illicit practice; and on another, as calculated to prevent\r\nvoluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America. I mention\r\nthese misconstructions, not with a view to give them an answer, for\r\nthey deserve none; but as specimens of the manner and spirit, in which\r\nsome have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST, No. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nAll this is admitted, it will perhaps be said: but does it follow from\r\nan admission of numbers for the measure of representation, or of\r\nslaves combined with free citizens as a ratio of taxation, that slaves\r\nought to be included in the numerical rule of representation?\r\n\r\nSlaves are considered as property, not as persons. They ought\r\ntherefore, to be comprehended in estimates of taxation, which are\r\nfounded on property, and to be excluded from representation, which is\r\nregulated by a census of persons. This is the objection as I\r\nunderstand it; stated in its full force. I shall be equally candid in\r\nstating the reasoning which may be offered on the opposite side. We\r\nsubscribe to the doctrine, might one of our Southern brethren observe,\r\nthat representation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation\r\nmore immediately to property; and we join in the application of this\r\ndistinction to the case of our slaves.\r\n\r\nBut we must deny the fact, that slaves are considered merely as\r\nproperty, and in no respect whatever as persons. The true state of the\r\ncase is, that they partake of both these qualities, being considered\r\nby our laws, in some respects as persons, and in other respects as\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIn being compelled to labor, not for himself; but for a master; in\r\nbeing vendible by one master to another master; and in being subject\r\nat all times to be restrained in his liberty and chastised in his body\r\nby the capricious will of another; the slave may appear to be degraded\r\nfrom the human rank, and classed with those irrational animals which\r\nfall under the legal denomination of property. In being protected, on\r\nthe other hand, in his life, and in his limbs, against the violence of\r\nall others, even the master of his labor and his liberty; and in being\r\npunishable himself for all violence committed against others; the\r\nslave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a member of the\r\nsociety, not as a part of the irrational creation; as a moral person,\r\nnot as a mere article of property. The Federal Constitution,\r\ntherefore, decides with great propriety on the case of our slaves,\r\nwhen it views them in the mixed character of persons and property.\r\nThis is in fact their true character. It is the character bestowed on\r\nthem by the laws under which they live, and it will not be denied,\r\nthat these are the proper criterion; because it is only under the\r\npretext, that the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of\r\nproperty, that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers;\r\nand it is admitted, that if the laws were to restore the rights which\r\nhave been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an equal\r\nshare of representation with the other inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThis question may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all\r\nsides, that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation, as they\r\nare the only proper scale of representation. Would the convention have\r\nbeen impartial or consistent, if they had rejected the slaves from the\r\nlist of inhabitants, when the shares of representation were to be\r\ncalculated; and inserted them on the lists when the tariff of\r\ncontributions was to be adjusted?\r\n\r\nCould it be reasonably expected, that the Southern States would concur\r\nin a system, which considered their slaves in some degree as men, when\r\nburdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider them in the same\r\nlight, when advantages were to be conferred?\r\n\r\nMight not some surprise also be expressed, that those who reproach the\r\nSouthern States with the barbarous policy of considering as property a\r\npart of their human brethren, should themselves contend, that the\r\ngovernment to which all the States are to be parties, ought to\r\nconsider this unfortunate race more completely in the unnatural light\r\nof property, than the very laws of which they complain?\r\n\r\nIt may be replied, perhaps, that slaves are not included in the\r\nestimate of representatives in any of the States possessing them. They\r\nneither vote themselves, nor increase the votes of their masters. Upon\r\nwhat principle, then, ought they to be taken into the Federal estimate\r\nof representation? In rejecting them altogether, the Constitution\r\nwould, in this respect, have followed the very laws which have been\r\nappealed to the proper guide.\r\n\r\nThis objection is repelled by a single observation. It is a\r\nfundamental principle of the proposed Constitution, that as the\r\naggregate number of representatives allotted to the several States is\r\nto be determined by a Federal rule, founded on the aggregate number of\r\ninhabitants; so, the right of choosing this allotted number in each\r\nState, is to be exercised by such part of the inhabitants, as the\r\nState itself may designate. The qualifications on which the right of\r\nsuffrage depends, are not perhaps the same in any two States. In some\r\nof the States the difference is very material. In every State, a\r\ncertain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by the\r\nConstitution of the State, who will be included in the census by which\r\nthe Federal Constitution apportions the representatives. In this point\r\nof view, the Southern States might retort the complaint, by insisting,\r\nthat the principle laid down by the convention required that no regard\r\nshould be had to the policy of particular States towards their own\r\ninhabitants; and consequently, that the slaves, as inhabitants, should\r\nhave been admitted into the census according to their full number, in\r\nlike manner with other inhabitants, who, by the policy of other\r\nStates, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A rigorous\r\nadherence, however, to this principle is waived by those who would be\r\ngainers by it. All that they ask, is that equal moderation be shown on\r\nthe other side. Let the case of the slaves be considered, as it is in\r\ntruth, a peculiar one. Let the compromising expedient of the\r\nConstitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as inhabitants,\r\nbut as debased by servitude below the equal level of free inhabitants,\r\nwhich regards the _slave_ as divested of two-fifths of the _man_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEBATES IN FIRST CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLLOYD'S DEBATES.\r\n\r\nMay 13, 1789.\r\n\r\nMr. PARKER (of Va.) moved to insert a clause in the bill, imposing a\r\nduty on the importation of slaves of ten dollars each person. He was\r\nsorry that the Constitution prevented Congress from prohibiting the\r\nimportation altogether; he thought it a defect in that instrument that\r\nit allowed of such actions, it was contrary to the revolution\r\nprinciples, and ought not to be permitted; but as he could not do all\r\nthe good he desired, he was willing to do what lay in his power. He\r\nhoped such a duty as he moved for would prevent, in some degree, this\r\nirrational and inhuman traffic; if so, he should feel happy from the\r\nsuccess of his motion.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH (of South Carolina,) hoped that such an important and\r\nserious proposition as this would not be hastily adopted; it was a\r\nvery late moment for the introduction of new subjects. He expected the\r\ncommittee had got through the business, and would rise without\r\ndiscussing any thing further; at least, if gentlemen were determined\r\non considering the present motion, he hoped they would delay for a few\r\ndays, in order to give time for an examination of the subject. It was\r\ncertainly a matter big with the most serious consequences to the State\r\nhe represented; be did not think any one thing that had been discussed\r\nwas so important to them, and the welfare of the Union, as the\r\nquestion now brought forward, but he was not prepared to enter on any\r\nargument, and therefore requested the motion might either be withdrawn\r\nor laid on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN (of Ct.) approved of the object of the motion, but he did\r\nnot think this bill was proper to embrace the subject. He could not\r\nreconcile himself to the insertion of human beings as an article of\r\nduty, among goods, wares and merchandise. He hoped it would be\r\nwithdrawn for the present, and taken up hereafter as an independent\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON, (of Geo.) observing the quarter from which this motion\r\ncame, said it did not surprise him, though it might have that effect\r\non others. He recollected that Virginia was an old settled State, and\r\nhad her complement of slaves, so she was careless of recruiting her\r\nnumbers by this means; the natural increase of her imported blacks\r\nwere sufficient for their purpose; but he thought gentlemen ought to\r\nlet their neighbors get supplied before they imposed such a burden\r\nupon the importation. He knew this business was viewed in an odious\r\nlight to the Eastward, because the people were capable of doing their\r\nown work, and had no occasion for slaves; but gentlemen will have some\r\nfeeling for others; they will not try to throw all the weight upon\r\nothers, who have assisted in lightening their burdens; they do not\r\nwish to charge us for every comfort and enjoyment of life, and at the\r\nsame time take away the means of procuring them; they do not wish to\r\nbreak us down at once.\r\n\r\nHe was convinced, from the inaptitude of the motion, and the want of\r\ntime to consider it, that the candor of the gentleman would induce him\r\nto withdraw it for the present; and if ever it came forward again, he\r\nhoped it would comprehend the white slaves as well as black, who were\r\nimported from all the goals of Europe; wretches, convicted of the most\r\nflagrant crimes, were brought in and sold without any duty whatever.\r\nHe thought that they ought to be taxed equal to the Africans, and had\r\nno doubt but the constitutionality and propriety of such a measure was\r\nequally apparent as the one proposed.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCKER (of S.C.) thought it unfair to bring in such an important\r\nsubject at a time when debate was almost precluded. The committee had\r\ngone through the impost bill, and the whole Union were impatiently\r\nexpecting the result of their deliberations, the public must be\r\ndisappointed and much revenue lost, or this question cannot undergo\r\nthat full discussion which it deserves.\r\n\r\nWe have no right, said he, to consider whether the importation of\r\nslaves is proper or not; the Constitution gives us no power on that\r\npoint, it is left to the States to judge of that matter as they see\r\nfit. But if it was a business the gentleman was determined to\r\ndiscourage, he ought to have brought his motion forward sooner, and\r\neven then not have introduced it without previous notice. He hoped the\r\ncommittee would reject the motion, if it was not withdrawn; he was not\r\nspeaking so much for the State he represented, as for Georgia, because\r\nthe State of South Carolina had a prohibitory law, which could be\r\nrenewed when its limitation expired.\r\n\r\nMr. PARKER (of Va.,) had ventured to introduce the subject after full\r\ndeliberation, and did not like to withdraw it. Although the gentleman\r\nfrom Connecticut (Mr. SHERMAN) had said, that they ought not to be\r\nenumerated with goods, wares, and merchandise, he believed they were\r\nlooked upon by the African traders in this light; he knew it was\r\ndegrading the human species to annex that character to them; but he\r\nwould rather do this than continue the actual evil of importing slaves\r\na moment longer. He hoped Congress would do all that lay in their\r\npower to restore to human nature its inherent privileges, and if\r\npossible wipe off the stigma which America labored under. The\r\ninconsistency in our principles, with which we are justly charged,\r\nshould be done away; that we may shew by our actions the pure\r\nbeneficence of the doctrine we held out to the world in our\r\ndeclaration of independence.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN (of Ct.,) thought the principles of the motion and the\r\nprinciples of the bill were inconsistent; the principle of the bill\r\nwas to raise revenue, the principle of the motion to correct a moral\r\nevil. Now, considering it as an object of revenue, it would be unjust,\r\nbecause two or three States would bear the whole burden, while he\r\nbelieved they bore their full proportion of all the rest. He was\r\nagainst receiving the motion into this bill, though he had no\r\nobjection to taking it up by itself, on the principles of humanity and\r\npolicy; and therefore would vote against it if it was not withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMr. AMES (of Mass.,) joined the gentleman last up. No one could\r\nsuppose him favorable to slavery, he detested it from his soul, but he\r\nhad some doubts whether imposing a duty on the importation, would not\r\nhave the appearance of countenancing the practice; it was certainly a\r\nsubject of some delicacy, and no one appeared to be prepared for the\r\ndiscussion, he therefore hoped the motion would be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMr. LIVERMORE. Was not against the principle of the motion, but in the\r\npresent case he conceived it improper. If negroes were goods, wares,\r\nor merchandise, they came within the title of the bill; if they were\r\nnot, the bill would be inconsistent; but if they are goods, wares or\r\nmerchandise, the 5 per cent ad valorem, will embrace the importation;\r\nand the duty of 5 per cent is nearly equal to 10 dollars per head, so\r\nthere is no occasion to add it even on the score of revenue.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON (of Ga.,) said it was the fashion of the day, to favor the\r\nliberty of slaves; he would not go into a discussion of the subject,\r\nbut he believed it was capable of demonstration that they were better\r\noff in their present situation, than they would be if they were\r\nmanumitted; what are they to do if they are discharged? Work for a\r\nliving? Experience has shewn us they will not. Examine what is become\r\nof those in Maryland, many of them have been set free in that State;\r\ndid they turn themselves to industry and useful pursuits? No, they\r\nturn out common pickpockets, petty larceny villains; and is this\r\nmercy, forsooth, to turn them into a way in which they must lose their\r\nlives,--for where they are thrown upon the world, void of property and\r\nconnections, they cannot get their living but by pilfering. What is to\r\nbe done for compensation? Will Virginia set all her negroes free? Will\r\nthey give up the money they cost them, and to whom? When this practice\r\ncomes to be tried there, the sound of liberty will lose those charms\r\nwhich make it grateful to the ravished ear.\r\n\r\nBut our slaves are not in a worse situation than they were on the\r\ncoast of Africa; it is not uncommon there for the parents to sell\r\ntheir children in peace; and in war the whole are taken and made\r\nslaves together. In these cases it is only a change of one slavery for\r\nanother; and are they not better here, where they have a master bound\r\nby the ties of interest and law to provide for their support and\r\ncomfort in old age, or infirmity, in which, if they were free, they\r\nwould sink under the pressure of woe for want of assistance.\r\n\r\nHe would say nothing of the partiality of such a tax, it was admitted\r\nby the avowed friends of the measure; Georgia in particular would be\r\noppressed. On this account it would be the most odious tax Congress\r\ncould impose.\r\n\r\nMr. SCHUREMAN (of N.J.) hoped the gentleman would withdraw his\r\nmotion, because the present was not the time or place for introducing\r\nthe business; he thought it had better be brought forward in the\r\nHouse, as a distinct proposition. If the gentleman persisted in having\r\nthe question determined, he would move the previous question if he was\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON, (of Va.) I cannot concur with gentlemen who think the\r\npresent an improper time or place to enter into a discussion of the\r\nproposed motion; if it is taken up in a separate view, we shall do the\r\nsame thing at a greater expense of time. But the gentlemen say that it\r\nis improper to connect the two objects, because they do not come\r\nwithin the title of the bill. But this objection may be obviated by\r\naccommodating the title to the contents; there may be some\r\ninconsistency in combining the ideas which gentlemen have expressed,\r\nthat is, considering the human race as a species of property; but the\r\nevil does not arise from adopting the clause now proposed, it is from\r\nthe importation to which it relates. Our object in enumerating persons\r\non paper with merchandise, is to prevent the practice of actually\r\ntreating them as such, by having them, in future, forming part of the\r\ncargoes of goods, wares, and merchandise to be imported into the\r\nUnited States. The motion is calculated to avoid the very evil\r\nintimated by the gentleman. It has been said that this tax will be\r\npartial and oppressive: but suppose a fair view is taken of this\r\nsubject, I think we may form a different conclusion. But if it be\r\npartial or oppressive, are there not many instances in which we have\r\nlaid taxes of this nature? Yet are they not thought to be justified by\r\nnational policy? If any article is warranted on this account, how much\r\nmore are we authorized to proceed on this occasion? The dictates of\r\nhumanity, the principles of the people, the national safety and\r\nhappiness, and prudent policy requires it of us; the constitution has\r\nparticularly called our attention to it--and of all the articles\r\ncontained in the bill before us, this is one of the last I should be\r\nwilling to make a concession upon so far as I was at liberty to go,\r\naccording to the terms of the constitution or principles of justice--I\r\nwould not have it understood that my zeal would carry me to disobey\r\nthe inviolable commands of either.\r\n\r\nI understood it had been intimated, that the motion was inconsistent\r\nor unconstitutional. I believe, sir, my worthy colleague has formed\r\nthe words with a particular reference to the Constitution; any how, so\r\nfar as the duty is expressed, it perfectly accords with that\r\ninstrument; if there are any inconsistencies in it, they may be\r\nrectified; I believe the intention is well understood, but I am far\r\nfrom supposing the diction improper. If the description of the persons\r\ndoes not accord with the ideas of the gentleman from Georgia, (Mr.\r\nJACKSON,) and his idea is a proper one for the committee to adopt, I\r\nsee no difficulty in changing the phraseology.\r\n\r\nI conceive the Constitution, in this particular, was formed in order\r\nthat the government, whilst it was restrained from laying a total\r\nprohibition, might be able to give some testimony of the sense of\r\nAmerica, with respect to the African trade. We have liberty to impose\r\na tax or duty upon the importation of such persons as any of the\r\nStates now existing shall think proper to admit; and this liberty was\r\ngranted, I presume, upon two considerations--the first was, that until\r\nthe time arrived when they might abolish the importation of slaves,\r\nthey might have an opportunity of evidencing their sentiments, on the\r\npolicy and humanity of such a trade; the other was that they might be\r\ntaxed in due proportion with other articles imported; for if the\r\npossessor will consider them as property, of course they are of value\r\nand ought to be paid for. If gentlemen are apprehensive of oppression\r\nfrom the weight of the tax, let them make an estimate of its\r\nproportion, and they will find that it very little exceeds five per\r\ncent ad valorem, so that they will gain very little by having them\r\nthrown into that mass of articles, whilst by selecting them in the\r\nmanner proposed, we shall fulfil the prevailing expectation of our\r\nfellow citizens, and perform our duty in executing the purposes of the\r\nConstitution. It is to be hoped that by expressing a national\r\ndisapprobation of this trade, we may destroy it, and save ourselves\r\nfrom reproaches, and our posterity the imbecility ever attendant on a\r\ncountry filled with slaves.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to say anything harsh, to the hearing of gentlemen who\r\nentertain different sentiments from me, or different sentiments from\r\nthose I represent; but if there is any one point in which it is\r\nclearly the policy of this nation, so far as we constitutionally can,\r\nto vary the practice of obtaining under some of the State governments,\r\nit is this; but it is certain a majority of the States are opposed to\r\nthis practice, therefore, upon principle, we ought to discountenance\r\nit as far as is in our power.\r\n\r\nIf I was not afraid of being told that the representatives of the\r\nseveral States, are the best able to judge of what is proper and\r\nconducive to their particular prosperity, I should venture to say that\r\nit is as much the interest of Georgia and South Carolina, as of any in\r\nthe Union. Every addition they receive to their number of slaves,\r\ntends to weaken them and renders them less capable of self defence. In\r\ncase of hostilities with foreign nations, they will be the means of\r\ninviting attack instead of repelling invasion. It is a necessary duty\r\nof the general government to protect every part of the empire against\r\ndanger, as well internal as external; every thing therefore which\r\ntends to increase this danger, though it may be a local affair, yet if\r\nit involves national expense or safety, becomes of concern to every\r\npart of the Union, and is a proper subject for the consideration of\r\nthose charged with the general administration of the government. I\r\nhope, in making these observations, I shall not be understood to mean\r\nthat a proper attention ought not to be paid to the local opinions and\r\ncircumstances of any part of the United States, or that the particular\r\nrepresentatives are not best able to judge of the sense of their\r\nimmediate constituents.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the proposed measure by the agreement there is between\r\nit, and the existing State laws, it will show us that it is patronized\r\nby a very respectable part of the Union. I am informed that South\r\nCarolina has prohibited the importation of slaves for several years\r\nyet to come; we have the satisfaction then of reflecting that we do\r\nnothing more than their own laws do at this moment. This is not the\r\ncase with one State. I am sorry that her situation is such as to seem\r\nto require a population of this nature, but it is impossible in the\r\nnature of things, to consult the national good without doing what we\r\ndo not wish to do, to some particular part. Perhaps gentlemen contend\r\nagainst the introduction of the clause, on too slight grounds. If it\r\ndoes not conform with the title of the bill, alter the latter; if it\r\ndoes not conform to the precise terms of the Constitution, amend it.\r\nBut if it will tend to delay the whole bill, that perhaps will be the\r\nbest reason for making it the object of a separate one. If this is the\r\nsense of the committee I shall submit.\r\n\r\nMr. GERRY (of Mass.) thought all duties ought to be laid as equal as\r\npossible. He had endeavored to enforce this principle yesterday, but\r\nwithout the success he wished for, he was bound by the principles of\r\njustice therefore to vote for the proposition; but if the committee\r\nwere desirous of considering the subject fully by itself, he had no\r\nobjection, but he thought when gentlemen laid down a principle, they\r\nought to support it generally.\r\n\r\nMr. BURKE (of S.C.) said, gentlemen were contending for nothing; that\r\nthe value of a slave, averaged about £80, and the duty on that sum at\r\nfive per cent, would be ten dollars, as congress could go no farther\r\nthan that sum, he conceived it made no difference whether they were\r\nenumerated or left in the common mass.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON, (of Va.) If we contend for nothing, the gentlemen who are\r\nopposed to us do not contend for a great deal; but the question is,\r\nwhether the five per cent ad valorem, on all articles imported, will\r\nhave any operation at all upon the introduction of slaves, unless we\r\nmake a particular enumeration on this account; the collector may\r\nmistake, for he would not presume to apply the term goods, wares, and\r\nmerchandise to any person whatsoever. But if that general definition\r\nof goods, wares and merchandise are supposed to include African\r\nSlaves, why may we not particularly enumerate them, and lay the duty\r\npointed out by the Constitution, which, as gentlemen tell us, is no\r\nmore than five per cent upon their value; this will not increase the\r\nburden upon any, but it will be that manifestation of our sense,\r\nexpected by our constituents, and demanded by justice and humanity.\r\n\r\nMr. BLAND (of Va.) had no doubt of the propriety or good policy of\r\nthis measure. He had made up his mind upon it, he wished had never\r\nbeen introduced into America; but if it was impossible at this time to\r\ncure the evil, he was very willing to join in any measures that would\r\nprevent its extending farther. He had some doubts whether the\r\nprohibitory laws of the States were not in part repealed. Those who\r\nhad endeavored to discountenance this trade, by laying a duty on the\r\nimportation, were prevented by the Constitution from continuing such\r\nregulation, which declares, that no State shall lay any impost or\r\nduties on imports. If this was the case, and he suspected pretty\r\nstrongly that it was, the necessity of adopting the proposition of his\r\ncolleague was now apparent.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN (of Ct.) said, the Constitution does not consider these\r\npersons as a species of property; it speaks of them as persons, and\r\nsays, that a tax or duty may be imposed on the importation of them\r\ninto any State which shall permit the same, but they have no power to\r\nprohibit such importation for twenty years. But Congress have power to\r\ndeclare upon what terms persons coming into the United States shall be\r\nentitled to citizenship; the rule of naturalization must however be\r\nuniform. He was convinced there were others ought to be regulated in\r\nthis particular, the importation of whom was of an evil tendency, he\r\nmeant convicts particularly. He thought that some regulation\r\nrespecting them was also proper; but it being a different subject, it\r\nought to be taken up in a different manner.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON (of Va.) was led to believe, from the observation that had\r\nfell from the gentlemen, that it would be best to make this the\r\nsubject of a distinct bill: he therefore wished his colleague would\r\nwithdraw his motion, and move in the house for leave to bring in a\r\nbill on the same principles.\r\n\r\nMr. PARKER (of Va.) consented to withdraw his motion, under a\r\nconviction that the house was fully satisfied of its propriety. He\r\nknew very well that these persons were neither goods, nor wares, but\r\nthey were treated as articles of merchandise. Although he wished to\r\nget rid of this part of his property, yet he should not consent to\r\ndeprive other people of theirs by any act of his without their\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nThe committee rose, reported progress, and the house adjourned.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 11th, 1790.\r\n\r\nMr. LAWRANCE (of New York,) presented an address from the society of\r\nFriends, in the City of New York; in which they set forth their desire\r\nof co-operating with their Southern brethren.\r\n\r\nMr. HARTLEY (of Penn.) then moved to refer the address of the annual\r\nassembly of Friends, held at Philadelphia, to a committee; he thought\r\nit a mark of respect due so numerous and respectable a part of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE (of Va.) seconded the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH, (of S.C.) However respectable the petitioners may be, I\r\nhope gentlemen will consider that others equally respectable are\r\nopposed to the object which is aimed at, and are entitled to an\r\nopportunity of being heard before the question is determined. I\r\nflatter myself gentlemen will not press the point of commitment\r\nto-day, it being contrary to our usual mode of procedure.\r\n\r\nMr. FITZSIMONS (of Penn.) If we were now about to determine the final\r\nquestion, the observation of the gentleman from South Carolina would\r\napply; but, sir, the present question does not touch upon the merits\r\nof the case; it is merely to refer the memorial to a committee, to\r\nconsider what is proper to be done; gentlemen, therefore, who do not\r\nmean to oppose the commitment to-morrow, may as well agree to it\r\nto-day, because it will tend to save the time of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON (of Geo.) wished to know why the second reading was to be\r\ncontended for to-day, when it was diverting the attention of the\r\nmembers from the great object that was before the committee of the\r\nwhole? Is it because the feelings of the Friends will be hurt, to have\r\ntheir affair conducted in the usual course of business? Gentlemen who\r\nadvocate the second reading to-day, should respect the feelings of the\r\nmembers who represent that part of the Union which is principally to\r\nbe affected by the measure. I believe, sir, that the latter class\r\nconsists of as useful and as good citizens as the petitioners, men\r\nequally friends to the revolution, and equally susceptible of the\r\nrefined sensations of humanity and benevolence. Why then should such\r\nparticular attention be paid to them, for bringing forward a business\r\nof questionable policy? If Congress are disposed to interfere in the\r\nimportation of slaves, they can take the subject up without advisers,\r\nbecause the Constitution expressly mentions all the power they can\r\nexercise on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN (of Conn.) suggested the idea of referring it to a\r\ncommittee, to consist of a member from each State, because several\r\nStates had already made some regulations on this subject. The sooner\r\nthe subject was taken up he thought it would be the better.\r\n\r\nMr. PARKER, (of Va.) I hope, Mr. Speaker, the petition of these\r\nrespectable people, will be attended to with all the readiness the\r\nimportance of its object demands; and I cannot help expressing the\r\npleasure I feel in finding so considerable a part of the community\r\nattending to matters of such momentous concern to the future\r\nprosperity and happiness of the people of America. I think it my duty,\r\nas a citizen of the Union, to espouse their cause; and it is incumbent\r\nupon every member of this house to sift the subject well, and\r\nascertain what can be done to restrain a practice so nefarious. The\r\nConstitution has authorized us to levy a tax upon the importation of\r\nsuch persons as the States shall authorize to be admitted. I would\r\nwillingly go to that extent; and if any thing further can be devised\r\nto discountenance the trade, consistent with the terms of the\r\nConstitution, I shall cheerfully give it my assent and support.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON, (of Va.) The gentleman from Pennsylvania, (Mr.\r\nFITZSIMONS) has put this question on its proper ground. If gentlemen\r\ndo not mean to oppose the commitment to-morrow, they may as well\r\nacquiesce in it to-day; and I apprehend gentlemen need not be alarmed\r\nat any measure it is likely Congress should take; because they will\r\nrecollect, that the Constitution secures to the individual States the\r\nright of admitting, if they think proper, the importation of slaves\r\ninto their own territory, for eighteen years yet unexpired; subject,\r\nhowever, to a tax, if Congress are disposed to impose it, of not more\r\nthan ten dollars on each person.\r\n\r\nThe petition, if I mistake not, speaks of artifices used by\r\nself-interested persons to carry on this trade; and the petition from\r\nNew York states a case that may require the consideration of Congress.\r\nIf anything is within the Federal authority to restrain such violation\r\nof the rights of nations, and of mankind, as is supposed to be\r\npractised in some parts of the United States, it will certainly tend\r\nto the interest and honor of the community to attempt a remedy, and is\r\na proper subject for our discussion. It may be, that foreigners take\r\nadvantage of the liberty afforded them by the American trade, to\r\nemploy our slipping in the slave trade between Africa and the West\r\nIndies, when they are restrained from employing their own by\r\nrestrictive laws of their nation. If this is the case, is there any\r\nperson of humanity that would not wish to prevent them? Another\r\nconsideration why we should commit the petition is, that we may give\r\nno ground of alarm by a serious opposition, as if we were about to\r\ntake measures that were unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nMr. STONE (of Md.) feared that if Congress took any measures,\r\nindicative of an intention to interfere with the kind of property\r\nalluded to, it would sink it in value very considerably, and might be\r\ninjurious to a great number of the citizens, particularly in the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\nHe thought the subject was of general concern, and that the\r\npetitioners had no more right to interfere will it than any other\r\nmembers of the community. It was an unfortunate circumstance, that it\r\nwas the property of sects to imagine they understood the rights of\r\nhuman nature better than all the world beside; and that they would, in\r\nconsequence, be meddling with concerns in which they had nothing to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nAs the petition relates to a subject of a general nature, it ought to\r\nlie on the table, as information; he would never consent to refer\r\npetitions, unless the petitioners were exclusively interested. Suppose\r\nthere was a petition to come before us from a society, praying us to\r\nbe honest in our transactions, or that we should administer the\r\nConstitution according to its intention--what would you do with a\r\npetition of this kind? Certainly it would remain on your table. He\r\nwould, nevertheless, not have it supposed, that the people had not a\r\nright to advise and give their opinion upon public measures; but he\r\nwould not be influenced by that advice or opinion, to take up a\r\nsubject sooner than the convenience of other business would admit.\r\nUnless he changed his sentiments, he would oppose the commitment.\r\n\r\nMr. BURKE (of S.C.) thought gentlemen were paying attention to what\r\ndid not deserve it. The men in the gallery had come here to meddle in\r\na business with which they had nothing to do; they were volunteering\r\nit in the cause of others, who neither expected nor desired it. He had\r\na respect for the body of Quakers, but, nevertheless, he did not\r\nbelieve they had more virtue, or religion, than other people, nor\r\nperhaps so much, if they were examined to the bottom, notwithstanding\r\ntheir outward pretences. If their petition is to be noticed, Congress\r\nought to wait till counter applications were made, and then they might\r\nhave the subject more fairly before them. The rights of the Southern\r\nStates ought not to be threatened, and their property endangered, to\r\nplease people who were to be unaffected by the consequences.\r\n\r\nMr. HARTLEY (of Penn.) thought the memorialists did not deserve to be\r\naspersed for their conduct, if influenced by motives of benignity,\r\nthey solicited the Legislature of the Union to repel, as far as in\r\ntheir power, the increase of a licentious traffic. Nor do they merit\r\ncensure, because their behavior has the appearance of more morality\r\nthan other people's. But it is not for Congress to refuse to hear the\r\napplications of their fellow citizens, while those applications\r\ncontain nothing unconstitutional or offensive. What is the object of\r\nthe address before us? It is intended to bring before this House a\r\nsubject of great importance to the cause of humanity; there are\r\ncertain facts to be enquired into, and the memorialists are ready to\r\ngive all the information in their power; they are waiting, at a great\r\ndistance from their homes, and wish to return; if, then, it will be\r\nproper to commit the petition to-morrow, it will be equally proper\r\nto-day, for it is conformable to our practice, beside, it will tend to\r\ntheir conveniency.\r\n\r\nMr. LAWRANCE (of N.Y.) The gentleman from South Carolina says, the\r\npetitioners are of a society not known in the laws or Constitution.\r\nSir, in all our acts, as well as in the Constitution, we have noticed\r\nthis Society; or why is it that we admit them to affirm, in cases\r\nwhere others are called upon to swear? If we pay this attention to\r\nthem, in one instance, what good reason is there for contemning them\r\nin another? I think the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. STONE,) carries\r\nhis apprehensions too far, when he fears that negro-property will fall\r\nin value, by the suppression of the slave-trade; not that I suppose it\r\nimmediately in the power of Congress to abolish a traffic which is a\r\ndisgrace to human nature; but it appears to me, that, if the\r\nimportation was crushed, the value of a slave would be increased\r\ninstead of diminished; however, considerations of this kind have\r\nnothing to do with the present question; gentlemen may acquiesce in\r\nthe commitment of the memorial, without pledging themselves to support\r\nits object.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON, (of Ga.) I differ much in opinion with the gentleman last\r\nup. I apprehend if, through the interference of the general\r\ngovernment, the slave trade was abolished, it would evince to the\r\npeople a disposition toward a total emancipation, and they would hold\r\ntheir property in jeopardy. Any extraordinary attention of Congress to\r\nthis petition may have, in some degree, a similar effect. I would beg\r\nto ask those, then, who are so desirous of freeing the negroes, if\r\nthey have funds sufficient to pay for them? If they have, they may\r\ncome forward on that business with some propriety; but, if they have\r\nnot, they should keep themselves quiet, and not interfere with a\r\nbusiness in which they are not interested. They may as well come\r\nforward, and solicit Congress to interdict the West India trade,\r\nbecause it is injurious to the morals of mankind; from thence we\r\nimport rum, which has a debasing influence upon the consumer. But,\r\nsir, is the whole morality of the United States confined to the\r\nQuakers? Are they the only people whose feelings are to be consulted\r\non this occasion? Is it to them we owe our present happiness? Was it\r\nthey who formed the Constitution? Did they, by their arms, or\r\ncontributions, establish our independence? I believe they were\r\ngenerally opposed to that measure. Why, then, on their application,\r\nshall we injure men, who, at the risk of their lives and fortunes,\r\nsecured to the community their liberty and property? If Congress pay\r\nany uncommon degree of attention to their petition, it will furnish\r\njust ground of alarm to the Southern States. But, why do these men set\r\nthemselves up, in such a particular manner, against slavery? Do they\r\nunderstand the rights of mankind, and the disposition of Providence\r\nbetter than others? If they were to consult that Book which claims our\r\nregard, they will find that slavery is not only allowed, but\r\ncommended. Their Saviour, who possessed more benevolence and\r\ncommiseration than they pretend to, has allowed of it. And if they\r\nfully examine the subject, they will find that slavery has been no\r\nnovel doctrine since the days of Cain. But be these things as they\r\nmay, I hope the House will order the petition to lie on the table, in\r\norder to prevent alarming our Southern brethren.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDGWICK, (of Mass.) If it was a serious question, whether the\r\nMemorial should be committed or not, I would not urge it at this time;\r\nbut that cannot be a question for a moment, if we consider our\r\nrelative situation with the people. A number of men,--who are\r\ncertainly very respectable, and of whom, as a society, it may be said\r\nwith truth, that they conform their moral conduct to their religious\r\ntenets, as much as any people in the whole community,--come forward\r\nand tell you, that you may effect two objects by the exercise of a\r\nConstitutional authority which will give great satisfaction; on the\r\none hand you may acquire revenue, and on the other, restrain a\r\npractice productive of great evil. Now, setting aside the religious\r\nmotives which influenced their application, have they not a right, as\r\ncitizens, to give their opinion of public measures? For my part I do\r\nnot apprehend that any State, or any considerable number of\r\nindividuals in any State, will be seriously alarmed at the commitment\r\nof the petition, from a fear that Congress intend to exercise an\r\nunconstitutional authority, in order to violate their rights; I\r\nbelieve there is not a wish of the kind entertained by any member of\r\nthis body. How can gentlemen hesitate then to pay that respect to a\r\nmemorial which it is entitled to, according to the ordinary mode of\r\nprocedure in business? Why shall we defer doing that till to-morrow,\r\nwhich we can do to-day? for the result, I apprehend, will be the same\r\nin either case.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith, (of S.C.) The question, I apprehend, is, whether we will\r\ntake the petition up for a second reading, and not whether it shall be\r\ncommitted? Now, I oppose this, because it is contrary to our usual\r\npractice, and does not allow gentlemen time to consider of the merits\r\nof the prayer; perhaps some gentlemen may think it improper to commit\r\nit to so large a committee as has been mentioned; a variety of causes\r\nmay be supposed to show that such a hasty decision is improper;\r\nperhaps the prayer of it is improper. If I understood it right, on its\r\nfirst reading, though, to be sure, I did not comprehend perfectly all\r\nthat the petition contained, it prays that we should take measures for\r\nthe abolition of the slave trade; this is desiring an unconstitutional\r\nact, because the constitution secures that trade to the States,\r\nindependent of congressional restrictions, for the term of twenty-one\r\nyears. If, therefore, it prays for a violation of constitutional\r\nrights, it ought to be rejected, as an attempt upon the virtue and\r\npatriotism of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. BOUDINOT, (of N.J.) It has been said that the Quakers have no\r\nright to interfere in this business; I am surprised to hear this\r\ndoctrine advanced, after it has been so lately contended, and settled,\r\nthat the people have a right to assemble and petition for redress of\r\ngrievances; it is not because the petition comes from the society of\r\nQuakers that I am in favor of the commitment, but because it comes\r\nfrom citizens of the United States, who are as equally concerned in\r\nthe welfare and happiness of their country as others. There certainly\r\nis no foundation for the apprehensions which seem to prevail in\r\ngentlemen's minds. If the petitioners were so uninformed: as to\r\nsuppose that Congress could be guilty of a violation of the\r\nConstitution, yet, I trust we know our duty better than to be led\r\nastray by an application from any man, or set of men whatever. I do\r\nnot consider the merits of the main question to be before us; it will\r\nbe time enough to give our opinions upon that, when the committee have\r\nreported. If it is in our power, by recommendation, or any other way,\r\nto put a stop to the slave trade in America, I do not doubt of its\r\npolicy; but how far the Constitution will authorize us to attempt to\r\ndepress it, will be a question well worthy of our consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN (of Conn.) observed, that the petitioners from New York,\r\nstated that they had applied to the legislature of that State, to\r\nprohibit certain practices which they conceived to be improper, and\r\nwhich tended to injure the well-being of the community; that the\r\nlegislature had considered the application, but had applied no remedy,\r\nbecause they supposed that power was exclusively vested in the general\r\ngovernment, under the Constitution of the United States; it would,\r\ntherefore, be proper to commit that petition, in order to ascertain\r\nwhat were the powers of the general government, in the case doubted by\r\nthe legislature of New York.\r\n\r\nMr. GERRY (of Mass.) thought gentlemen were out of order in entering\r\nupon the merits of the main question at this time, when they were\r\nconsidering the expediency of committing the petition; he should,\r\ntherefore, not follow them further in that track than barely to\r\nobserve, that it was the right of the citizens to apply for redress,\r\nin every case they conceived themselves aggrieved in; and it was the\r\nduty of Congress to afford redress as far as is in their power. That\r\ntheir Southern brethren had been betrayed into the slave trade by the\r\nfirst settlers, was to be lamented; they were not to be reflected on\r\nfor not viewing this subject in a different light, the prejudice of\r\neducation is eradicated with difficulty; but he thought nothing would\r\nexcuse the general government for not exerting itself to prevent, as\r\nfar as they constitutionally could, the evils resulting from such\r\nenormities as were alluded to by the petitioners; and the same\r\nconsiderations induced him highly to commend the part the society of\r\nFriends had taken; it was the cause of humanity they had interested\r\nthemselves in, and he wished, with them, to see measures pursued by\r\nevery nation, to wipe off the indelible stain which the slave trade\r\nhad brought upon all who were concerned in it.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON (of Va.) thought the question before the committee was no\r\notherwise important than as gentlemen made it so by their serious\r\nopposition. Did they permit the commitment of the Memorial, as a\r\nmatter of course, no notice would be taken of it out of doors; it\r\ncould never be blown up into a decision of the question respecting the\r\ndiscouragement of the African slave trade, nor alarm the owners with\r\nan apprehension that the general government were about to abolish\r\nslavery in all the States; such things are not contemplated by any\r\ngentleman; but, to appearance, they decide the question more against\r\nthemselves than would be the case if it was determined on its real\r\nmerits, because gentlemen may be disposed to vote for the commitment\r\nof a petition, without any intention of supporting the prayer of it.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE (of Va.) would not have seconded the motion, if he had\r\nthought it would have brought on a lengthy debate. He conceived that a\r\nbusiness of this kind ought to be decided without much discussion; it\r\nhad constantly been the practice of the house, and he did not suppose\r\nthere was any reason for a deviation.\r\n\r\nMr. PAGE (of Va.) said, if the memorial had been presented by any\r\nindividual, instead of the respectable body it was, he should have\r\nvoted in favor of a commitment, because it was the duty of the\r\nlegislature to attend to subjects brought before them by their\r\nconstituents; if, upon inquiry, it was discovered to be improper to\r\ncomply with the prayer of the petitioners, he would say so, and they\r\nwould be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMr. STONE (of Md.) thought the business ought to be left to take its\r\nusual course; by the rules of the house, it was expressly declared,\r\nthat petitions, memorials, and other papers, addressed to the house,\r\nshould not be debated or decided on the day they were first read.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN (of Ga.) felt at a loss to account why precipitation was\r\nused on this occasion, contrary to the customary usage of the house;\r\nhe had not heard a single reason advanced in favor of it. To be sure\r\nit was said the petitioners are a respectable body of men--he did not\r\ndeny it--but, certainly, gentlemen did not suppose they were paying\r\nrespect to them, or to the house, when they urged such a hasty\r\nprocedure; anyhow it was contrary to his idea of respect, and the idea\r\nthe house had always expressed, when they had important subjects under\r\nconsideration; and, therefore, he should be against the motion. He was\r\nafraid that there was really a little volunteering in this business,\r\nas it had been termed by the gentleman from Georgia.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTINGTON (of Conn.) considered the petitioners as much\r\ndisinterested as any person in the United States; he was persuaded\r\nthey had an aversion to slavery; yet they were not singular in this,\r\nothers had the same; and he hoped when Congress took up the subject,\r\nthey would go as far as possible to prohibit the evil complained of.\r\nBut he thought that would better be done by considering it in the\r\nlight of revenue. When the committee of the whole, on the finance\r\nbusiness, came to the ways and means, it might properly be taken into\r\nconsideration, without giving any ground for alarm.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCKER, (of S.C.) I have no doubt on my mind respecting what ought\r\nto be done on this occasion; so far from committing the memorial, we\r\nought to dismiss it without further notice. What is the purport of the\r\nmemorial? It is plainly this; to reprobate a particular kind of\r\ncommerce, in a moral view, and to request the interposition of\r\nCongress to effect its abrogation. But Congress have no authority,\r\nunder the constitution, to do more than lay a duty of ten dollars upon\r\neach person imported; and this is a political consideration, not\r\narising from either religion or morality, and is the only principle\r\nupon which we can proceed to take it up. But what effect do these men\r\nsuppose will arise from their exertions? Will a duty of ten dollars\r\ndiminish the importation? Will the treatment be better than usual? I\r\napprehend it will not, nay, it may be worse. Because an interference\r\nwith the subject may excite a great degree of restlessness in the\r\nminds of those it is intended to serve, and that may be a cause for\r\nthe masters to use more rigor towards them, than they would otherwise\r\nexert; so that these men seem to overshoot their object. But if they\r\nwill endeavor to procure the abolition of the slave trade, let them\r\nprefer their petitions to the State legislatures, who alone have the\r\npower of forbidding the importation; I believe their applications\r\nthere would be improper; but if they are any where proper, it is\r\nthere. I look upon the address then to be ill-judged, however good the\r\nintention of the framers.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH (of S.C.) claimed it as a right, that the petition should\r\nlay over till to-morrow.\r\n\r\nMr. BOUDINOT (of N.J.) said it was not unusual to commit petitions on\r\nthe day they were presented; and the rules of the house admitted the\r\npractice, by the qualification which followed the positive order, that\r\npetitions should not be decided on the day they were first read,\r\n\"unless where the house shall direct otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH (of S.C.) declared his intention of calling the yeas and\r\nnays, if gentlemen persisted in pressing the question.\r\n\r\nMr. CLYMER (of Penn.) hoped the motion would be withdrawn for the\r\npresent, and the business taken up in course to-morrow; because,\r\nthough he respected the memorialists, he also respected order and the\r\nsituation of the members.\r\n\r\nMr. FITZSIMONS (of Penn.) did not recollect whether he moved or\r\nseconded the motion, but if he had, he should not withdraw it on\r\naccount of the threat of calling the yeas and nays.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN (of Ga.) hoped the business would be conducted with temper\r\nand moderation, and that gentlemen would concede and pass the subject\r\nover for a day at least.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH (of S.C.) had no idea of holding out a threat to any\r\ngentleman. If the declaration of an intention to call the yeas and\r\nnays was viewed by gentlemen in that light, he would withdraw that\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE (of Va.) hereupon withdrew his motion. And the address was\r\nordered to lie on the table.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 12th, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe following memorial was presented and read:\r\n\r\n\"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: The\r\nmemorial of the Pennsylvania Society for promoting the abolition of\r\nslavery, the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage, and\r\nthe improvement of the condition of the African race, respectfully\r\nshoweth: That from a regard for the happiness of mankind, an\r\nassociation was formed several years since in this State, by a number\r\nof her citizens, of various religious denominations, for promoting the\r\nabolition of slavery, and for the relief of those unlawfully held in\r\nbondage. A just and acute conception of the true principles of\r\nliberty, as it spread through the land, produced accessions to their\r\nnumbers, many friends to their cause, and a legislative cooperation\r\nwith their views, which, by the blessing of Divine Providence, have\r\nbeen successfully directed to the relieving from bondage a large\r\nnumber of their fellow creatures of the African race. They have also\r\nthe satisfaction to observe, that, in consequence of that spirit of\r\nphilanthropy and genuine liberty which is generally diffusing its\r\nbeneficial influence, similar institutions are forming at home and\r\nabroad. That mankind are all formed by the same Almighty Being, alike\r\nobjects of his care, and equally designed for the enjoyment of\r\nhappiness, the Christian religion teaches us to believe, and the\r\npolitical creed of Americans fully coincides with the position. Your\r\nmemorialists, particularly engaged in attending to the distresses\r\narising from slavery, believe it their indispensable duty to present\r\nthis subject to your notice. They have observed with real\r\nsatisfaction, that many important and salutary powers are vested in\r\nyou for 'promoting the welfare and securing the blessings of liberty\r\nto the people of the United States;' and as they conceive, that these\r\nblessings ought rightfully to be administered without distinction of\r\ncolor, to all descriptions of people, so they indulge themselves in\r\nthe pleasing expectation, that nothing which can be done for the\r\nrelief of the unhappy objects of their care, will be either omitted or\r\ndelayed. From a persuasion that equal liberty was originally the\r\nportion, and is still the birth-right of all men, and influenced by\r\nthe strong ties of humanity and the principles of their institution,\r\nyour memorialists conceived themselves bound to use all justifiable\r\nendeavors to loosen the bands of slavery, and promote a general\r\nenjoyment of the blessings of freedom. Under these impressions, they\r\nearnestly entreat your serious attention to the subject of slavery;\r\nthat you will be pleased to countenance the restoration of liberty to\r\nthose unhappy men, who alone, in this land of freedom, are degraded\r\ninto perpetual bondage, and who, amidst the general joy of surrounding\r\nfreemen, are groaning in servile subjection; that you will devise\r\nmeans for removing this inconsistency from the character of the\r\nAmerican people; that you will promote mercy and justice towards this\r\ndistressed race, and that you will step to the very verge of the power\r\nvested in you, for discouraging every species of traffic in the\r\npersons of our fellow-men.\r\n\r\n\"BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, _President._\r\n\r\n\"PHILADELPHIA, _February 3, 1790.\"_\r\n\r\nMr. HARTLEY (of Penn.) then called up the memorial presented\r\nyesterday, from the annual meeting of Friends at Philadelphia, for a\r\nsecond reading; whereupon the same was read a second time, and moved\r\nto be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCKER (of S.C.) was sorry the petition had a second reading, as\r\nhe conceived it contained an unconstitutional request, and from that\r\nconsideration he wished it thrown aside. He feared the commitment of\r\nit would be a very alarming circumstance to the Southern States; for\r\nif the object was to engage Congress in an unconstitutional measure,\r\nit would be considered as an interference with their rights, the\r\npeople would become very uneasy under the government, and lament that\r\nthey ever put additional powers into their hands. He was surprised to\r\nsee another memorial on the same subject, and that signed by a man who\r\nought to have known the constitution better. He thought it a\r\nmischievous attempt, as it respected the persons in whose favor it was\r\nintended. It would buoy them up with hopes, without a foundation, and\r\nas they could not reason on the subject, as more enlightened men\r\nwould, they might be led to do what they would be punished for, and\r\nthe owners of them, in their own defence, would be compelled to\r\nexercise over them a severity they were not accustomed to. Do these\r\nmen expect a general emancipation of slaves by law? This would never\r\nbe submitted to by the Southern States without a civil war. Do they\r\nmean to purchase their freedom? He believed their money would fall\r\nshort of the price. But how is it they are more concerned in this\r\nbusiness than others? Are they the only persons who possess religion\r\nand morality? If the people are not so exemplary, certainly they will\r\nadmit the clergy are; why then do we not find them uniting in a body,\r\npraying us to adopt measures for the promotion of religion and piety,\r\nor any moral object? They know it would be an improper interference;\r\nand to say the best of this memorial, it is an act of imprudence,\r\nwhich he hoped would receive no countenance from the house.\r\n\r\nMr. SENEY (of Md.) denied that there was anything unconstitutional in\r\nthe memorial, at least, if there was, it had escaped his attention,\r\nand he should be obliged to the gentleman to point it out. Its only\r\nobject was, that congress should exercise their constitutional\r\nauthority, to abate the horrors of slavery, as far as they could:\r\nIndeed, he considered that all altercation on the subject of\r\ncommitment was at an end, as the house had impliedly determined\r\nyesterday that it should be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. BURKE (of S.C.) saw the disposition of the house, and he feared\r\nit would be referred to a committee, maugre all their opposition; but\r\nhe must insist that it prayed for an unconstitutional measure. Did it\r\nnot desire congress to interfere and abolish the slave trade, while\r\nthe constitution expressly stipulated that congress should exercise no\r\nsuch power? He was certain the commitment would sound an alarm, and\r\nblow the trumpet of sedition in the Southern States. He was sorry to\r\nsee the petitioners paid more attention to than the constitution;\r\nhowever, he would do his duty, and oppose the business totally; and if\r\nit was referred to a committee, as mentioned yesterday, consisting of\r\na member from each State, and he was appointed, he would decline\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nMr. SCOTT, (of Penn.) I can't entertain a doubt but the memorial is\r\nstrictly agreeable to the constitution: it respects a part of the duty\r\nparticularly assigned to us by that instrument, and I hope we may, be\r\ninclined to take it into consideration. We can, at present, lay our\r\nhands upon a small duty of ten dollars. I would take this, and if it\r\nis all we can do, we must be content. But I am sorry that the framers\r\nof the constitution did not go farther and enable us to interdict it\r\nfor good and all; for I look upon the slave-trade to be one of the\r\nmost abominable things on earth; and if there was neither God nor\r\ndevil, I should oppose it upon the principles of humanity and the law\r\nof nature. I cannot, for my part, conceive how any person can be said\r\nto acquire a property in another; is it by virtue of conquest? What\r\nare the rights of conquest? Some have dared to advance this monstrous\r\nprinciple, that the conqueror is absolute master of his conquest; that\r\nhe may dispose of it as his property, and treat it as he pleases; but\r\nenough of those who reduce men to the state of transferable goods, or\r\nuse them like beasts of burden; who deliver them up as the property or\r\npatrimony of another man. Let us argue on principles countenanced by\r\nreason and becoming humanity; the petitioners view the subject in a\r\nreligious light, but I do not stand in need of religious motives to\r\ninduce me to reprobate the traffic in human flesh; other\r\nconsiderations weigh with me to support the commitment of the\r\nmemorial, and to support every constitutional measure likely to bring\r\nabout its total abolition. Perhaps, in our legislative capacity, we\r\ncan go no further than to impose a duty of ten dollars, but I do not\r\nknow how far I might go, if I was one of the judges of the United\r\nStates, and those people were to come before me and claim their\r\nemancipation; but I am sure I would go as far as I could.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON (of Ga.) differed with the gentleman last up, and supposed\r\nthe master had a qualified property in his slave; he said the contrary\r\ndoctrine would go to the destruction of every species of personal\r\nservice. The gentleman said he did not stand in need of religion to\r\ninduce him to reprobate slavery, but if he is guided by that evidence,\r\nwhich the Christian system is founded upon, he will find that religion\r\nis not against it; he will see, from Genesis to Revelation, the\r\ncurrent setting strong that way. There never was a government on the\r\nface of the earth, but what permitted slavery. The purest sons of\r\nfreedom in the Grecian republics, the citizens of Athens and\r\nLacedaemon all held slaves. On this principle the nations of Europe\r\nare associated; it is the basis of the feudal system. But suppose all\r\nthis to have been wrong, let me ask the gentleman, if it is policy to\r\nbring forward a business at this moment, likely to light up a flame of\r\ncivil discord, for the people of the Southern States will resist one\r\ntyranny as soon as another; the other parts of the continent may bear\r\nthem down by force of arms, but they will never suffer themselves to\r\nbe divested of their property without a struggle. The gentleman says,\r\nif he was a federal judge, he does not know to what length he would go\r\nin emancipating these people; but, I believe his judgment would be of\r\nshort duration in Georgia; perhaps even the existence of such a judge\r\nmight be in danger.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN (of Conn.) could see no difficulty in committing the\r\nmemorial; because it was probable the committee would understand their\r\nbusiness, and perhaps they might bring in such a report as would be\r\nsatisfactory to gentlemen on both sides of the House.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN (of Ga.) was sorry the subject had ever been brought\r\nbefore Congress, because it was of a delicate nature, as it respected\r\nsome of the States. Gentlemen who had been present at the formation of\r\nthis Constitution, could not avoid the recollection of the pain and\r\ndifficulty which the subject caused in that body; the members from the\r\nSouthern States were so tender upon this point, that they had well\r\nnigh broken up without coming to any determination; however, from the\r\nextreme desire of preserving the Union, and obtaining an efficient\r\ngovernment, they were induced mutually, to concede, and the\r\nConstitution jealously guarded what they agreed to. If gentlemen look\r\nover the footsteps of that body, they will find the greatest degree\r\nof caution used to imprint them, so as not to be easily eradicated;\r\nbut the moment we go to jostle on that ground, said he, I fear we\r\nshall feel it tremble under our feet. Congress have no power to\r\ninterfere with the importation of slaves, beyond what is given in the\r\n9th section of the first article of the Constitution; every thing else\r\nis interdicted to them in the strongest terms. If we examine the\r\nConstitution, we shall find the expressions, relative to this subject,\r\ncautiously expressed, and more punctiliously guarded than any other\r\npart. \"The migration or importation of such persons, shall not be\r\nprohibited by Congress.\" But lest this should not have secured the\r\nobject sufficiently, it is declared in the same section, \"That no\r\ncapitation or direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the\r\ncensus;\" this was intended to prevent Congress from laying any special\r\ntax upon negro slaves, as they might, in this way, so burthen the\r\npossessors of them, as to induce a general emancipation. If we go on\r\nto the 5th article, we shall find the 1st and 5th clauses of the 9th\r\nsection of the 1st article restrained from being altered before the\r\nyear 1808.\r\n\r\nGentlemen have said, that this petition does not pray for an abolition\r\nof the slave-trade; I think, sir, it prays for nothing else, and\r\ntherefore we have no more to do with it, than if it prayed us to\r\nestablish an order of nobility, or a national religion.\r\n\r\nMr. SYLVESTER (of N.Y.) said that he had always been in the habit of\r\nrespecting the society called Quakers; he respected them for their\r\nexertions in the cause of humanity, but he thought the present was not\r\na time to enter into a consideration of the subject, especially as he\r\nconceived it to be a business in the province of the State\r\nlegislatures.\r\n\r\nMr. LAWRANCE (of N.Y.) observed that the subject would undoubtedly\r\ncome under the consideration of the house; and he thought, that as it\r\nwas now before them, that the present time was as proper as any; he\r\nwas therefore for committing the memorial; and when the prayer of it\r\nhad been properly examined, they could see how far Congress may\r\nconstitutionally interfere; as they knew the limits of their power on\r\nthis, as well as on every other occasion, there was no just\r\napprehension to be entertained that they would go beyond them. Mr.\r\nSmith (of S.C.) insisted that it was not in the power of the House to\r\nbrunt the prayer of the petition, which event to the total abolishment\r\nof the slave-trade, and it was therefore unnecessary to commit it. He\r\nobserved, that in the Southern States, difficulties had arisen on\r\nadopting the Constitution, inasmuch as it was apprehended, that\r\nCongress might take measures under it for abolishing the slave-trade.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the petitioners, when they applied to this House, did not\r\nthink their object unconstitutional, but now they are told that if is,\r\nthey will be satisfied with the answer, and press it no further. If\r\ntheir object had been for Congress to lay a duty of ten dollars per\r\nhead on the importation of slaves, they would have said so, but that\r\ndoes not appear to have been the case; the commitment of the petition,\r\non that ground, cannot be contended; if they will not be content with\r\nthat, shall it be committed to investigate facts? The petition speaks\r\nof none; for what purpose then shall it be committed? If gentlemen can\r\nassign no good reason for the measure, they will not support it, when\r\nthey are told that it will create great jealousies and alarm in the\r\nSouthern States; for I can assure them, that there is no point on\r\nwhich they are more jealous and suspicious, than on a business with\r\nwhich they think the government has nothing to do.\r\n\r\nWhen we entered into this Confederacy, we did it from political, not\r\nfrom moral motives, and I do not think my constituents want to learn\r\nmorals from the petitioners; I do not believe they want improvement in\r\ntheir moral system; if they do, they can get it at home.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Georgia, has justly stated the jealousy of the\r\nSouthern States. On entering into this government, they apprehended\r\nthat the other States, not knowing the necessity the citizens of the\r\nSouthern States were under to hold this species of property, would,\r\nfrom motives of humanity and benevolence, be led to vote for a general\r\nemancipation; and had they not seen that the Constitution provided\r\nagainst the effect of such a disposition, I may be bold to say, they\r\nnever would have adopted it. And notwithstanding all the calumny's\r\nwith which some gentlemen have viewed the subject, they will find,\r\nthat the discussion alone will create great alarm. We have been told,\r\nthat if the discussion will create alarm, we ought to have avoided it,\r\nby saying nothing; but it was not for that purpose that we were sent\r\nhere; we look upon this measure as an attack upon the palladium of the\r\nproperty of our country; it is therefore our duty to oppose it by\r\nevery means in our power. Gentlemen should consider that when we\r\nentered into a political connexion with the other States, that this\r\nproperty was there; it was acquired under a former government,\r\nconformably to the laws and Constitution; therefore anything that will\r\ntend to deprive them of that property, must be an ex post facto law,\r\nand as such is forbid by our political compact.\r\n\r\nI said the States would never have entered into the confederation,\r\nunless their property had been guaranteed to them, for such is the\r\nstate of agriculture in that county, that without slaves it must be\r\ndepopulated. Why will these people then make use of arguments to\r\ninduce the slave to turn his hand against his master? We labor under\r\ndifficulties enough from the ravages of the late war. A gentleman can\r\nhardly come from that country, with a servant or two, either to this\r\nplace or Philadelphia, but what there are persons trying to seduce his\r\nservants to leave him; and, when they have done this, the poor\r\nwretches are obliged to rob their master in order to obtain a\r\nsubsistence; all those, therefore, who are concerned in this\r\nseduction, are accessaries to the robbery.\r\n\r\nThe reproaches which they cast upon the owners of negro property, is\r\ncharging them with the want of humanity; I believe the proprietors are\r\npersons of as much humanity as any part of the continent and are as\r\nconspicuous for their good morals as their neighbors. It was said\r\nyesterday, that the Quakers were a society known to the laws, and the\r\nConstitution, but they are no more so than other religious societies;\r\nthey stood exactly in the same situation; their memorial, therefore,\r\nrelates to a matter in which they are no more interested than any\r\nother sect, and can only be considered as a piece of advice; it is\r\ncustomary to refer a piece of advice to a committee, but if it is\r\nsupposed to pray for what they think a moral purpose, is that\r\nsufficient to induce us to commit it? What may appear a moral virtue\r\nin their eyes, may not be so in reality. I have heard of a sect of\r\nShaking Quakers, who, I presume, suppose their tenets of a moral\r\ntendency; I am informed one of them forbids to intermarry, yet in\r\nconsequence of their shakings and concussions, you may see them with a\r\nnumerous offspring about them. Now, if these people were to petition\r\nCongress to pass a law prohibiting matrimony, I ask, would gentlemen\r\nagree to refer such a petition? I think if they would reject one of\r\nthat nature, as improper, they ought also to reject this.\r\n\r\nMr. PAGE (of Va.) was in favor of the commitment; he hoped that the\r\ndesigns of the respectable memorialists would not be stopped at the\r\nthreshold, in order to preclude a fair discussion of the prayer of the\r\nmemorial. He observed that gentlemen had founded their arguments upon\r\na misrepresentation; for the object of the memorial was not declared\r\nto be the total abolition, of the slave trade; but that Congress would\r\nconsider, whether it be not in reality within their power to exercise\r\njustice and mercy, which, if adhered to, they cannot doubt must\r\nproduce the abolition of the slave trade. If then the prayer contained\r\nnothing unconstitutional, he trusted the meritorious effort would not\r\nbe frustrated. With respect to the alarm that was apprehended, he\r\nconjectured there was none; but there might be just cause, if the\r\nmemorial was not taken into consideration. He placed himself in the\r\ncase of a slave, and said, that on hearing that Congress had refused\r\nto listen to the decent suggestions of a respectable part of the\r\ncommunity, he should infer, that the general government (from which\r\nwas expected great good would result to every class of citizens) had\r\nshut their ears against the voice of humanity, and he should despair\r\nof any alleviation of the miseries he and his posterity had in\r\nprospect; if anything could induce him to rebel, it must be a stroke\r\nlike this, impressing on his mind all the horrors of despair. But if\r\nhe was told, that application was made in his behalf and that Congress\r\nwere willing to hear what could be urged in favor of discouraging the\r\npractice of importing his fellow-wretches, he would trust in their\r\njustice and humanity, and wait the decision patiently. He presumed\r\nthat these unfortunate people would reason in the same way; and he,\r\ntherefore, conceived the most likely way to prevent danger, was to\r\ncommit the petition. He lived in a State which had the misfortune of\r\nhaving in her bosom a great number of slaves, he held many of them\r\nhimself, and was as much interested in the business, he believed, as\r\nany gentleman in South Carolina or Georgia, yet, if he was determined\r\nto hold them in eternal bondage, he should feel no uneasiness or alarm\r\non account of the present measure, because he should rely upon the\r\nvirtue of Congress, that they would not exercise any unconstitutional\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON (of Va.) The debate has taken a serious turn, and it will\r\nbe owing to this alone if an alarm is created; for had the memorial\r\nbeen treated in the usual way, it would have been considered as a\r\nmatter of course, and a report might have been made, so as to have\r\ngiven general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIf there was the slightest tendency by the commitment to break in upon\r\nthe Constitution, he would object to it; but he did not see upon what\r\nground such an event was to be apprehended. The petition prayed, in\r\ngeneral terms, for the interference of Congress, so far as they were\r\nconstitutionally authorized; but even if its prayer was, in some\r\ndegree, unconstitutional, it might be committed, as was the case on\r\nMr. Churchman's petition, one part of which was supposed to apply for\r\nan unconstitutional interference by the general government.\r\n\r\nHe admitted that Congress was restricted by the Constitution from\r\ntaking measures to abolish the slave trade; yet there were a variety\r\nof ways by which they could countenance the abolition, and they might\r\nmake some regulations respecting the introduction of them into the new\r\nStates, to be formed out of the Western Territory, different from what\r\nthey could in the old settled States. He thought the object well\r\nworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. GERRY (of Mass.) thought the interference of Congress fully\r\ncompatible with the Constitution, and could not help lamenting the\r\nmiseries to which the natives of Africa were exposed by this inhuman\r\ncommerce; and said that he never contemplated the subject, without\r\nreflecting what his own feelings would be, in case himself, his\r\nchildren, or friends, were placed in the same deplorable\r\ncircumstances. He then adverted to the flagrant acts of cruelty which\r\nare committed in carrying on that traffic; and asked whether it can be\r\nsupposed, that Congress has no power to prevent such transactions? He\r\nthen referred to the Constitution, and pointed out the restrictions\r\nlaid on the general government respecting the importation of slaves.\r\nIt was not, he presumed, in the contemplation of any gentleman in this\r\nhouse to violate that part of the Constitution; but that we have a\r\nright to regulate this business, is as clear as that we have any\r\nrights whatever; nor has the contrary been shown by any person who has\r\nspoken on the occasion. Congress can, agreeable to the Constitution,\r\nlay a duty of ten dollars on imported slaves; they may do this\r\nimmediately. He made a calculation of the value of the slaves in the\r\nSouthern States, and supposed they might be worth ten millions of\r\ndollars; Congress have a right, if they see proper, to make a proposal\r\nto the Southern States to purchase the whole of them, and their\r\nresources in the Western Territory may furnish them with means. He did\r\nnot intend to suggest a measure of this kind, he only instanced these\r\nparticulars, to show that Congress certainly have a right to\r\nintermeddle in the business. He thought that no objection had been\r\noffered, of any force, to prevent the commitment of the memorial.\r\n\r\nMr. BOUDINOT (of N.J.) had carefully examined the petition, and found\r\nnothing like what was complained of by gentlemen, contained in it; he,\r\ntherefore, hoped they would withdraw their opposition, and suffer it\r\nto be committed.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH (of S.C.) said, that as the petitioners had particularly\r\nprayed Congress to take measures for the annihilation of the slave\r\ntrade, and that was admitted on all hands to be beyond their power,\r\nand as the petitioners would not be gratified by a tax of ten dollars\r\nper head, which was all that was within their power, there was, of\r\nconsequence, no occasion for committing it.\r\n\r\nMr. STONE (of Md.) thought this memorial a thing of course; for there\r\nnever was a society, of any considerable extent, which did not\r\ninterfere with the concerns of other people, and this kind of\r\ninterference, whenever it has happened, has never failed to deluge the\r\ncountry in blood: on this principle he was opposed to the commitment.\r\n\r\nThe question on the commitment being about to be put, the yeas and\r\nnays were called for, and are as follows:--\r\n\r\nYeas.--Messrs. Ames, Benson, Boudinot, Brown, Cadwallader, Clymer,\r\nFitzsimons, Floyd, Foster, Gale, Gerry, Gilman, Goodhue, Griffin,\r\nGrout, Hartley, Hathorne, Heister, Huntington, Lawrance, Lee, Leonard,\r\nLivermore, Madison, Moore, Muhlenberg, Page, Parker, Partridge,\r\nRenssellaer, Schureman, Scott, Sedgwick, Seney, Sherman, Sinnickson,\r\nSmith of Maryland, Sturges, Thatcher, Trumbull, Wadsworth, White, and\r\nWynkoop--93.\r\n\r\nNoes.--Messrs. Baldwin, Bland, Bourke, Coles, Huger, Jackson, Mathews,\r\nSylvester, Smith of S.C., Stone, and Tucker--11.\r\n\r\nWhereupon it was determined in the affirmative; and on motion, the\r\npetition of the Society of Friends, at New York, and the memorial from\r\nthe Pennsylvania Society, for the abolition of slavery, were also\r\nreferred to a committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Debate on Committee's Report, March 1790._\r\n\r\nELIOT'S DEBATES.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCKER moved to modify the first paragraph by striking out all the\r\nwords after the word opinion, and to insert the following: that the\r\nseveral memorials proposed to the consideration of this house, a\r\nsubject on which its interference would be unconstitutional, and even\r\nits deliberations highly injurious to some of the States in the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON rose and observed, that he had been silent on the subject\r\nof the reports coming before the committee, because he wished the\r\nprinciples of the resolutions to be examined fairly, and to be decided\r\non their true grounds. He was against the propositions generally, and\r\nwould examine the policy, the justice and the use of them, and he\r\nhoped, if he could make them appear in the same light to others as\r\nthey did to him by fair argument, that the gentlemen in opposition\r\nwere not so determined in their opinions as not to give up their\r\npresent sentiments.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the policy of the measure, the situation of the slaves\r\nhere, their situation in their native States, and the disposal of them\r\nin case of emancipation, should be considered. That slavery was an\r\nevil habit, he did not mean to controvert; but that habit was already\r\nestablished, and there were peculiar situations in countries which\r\nrendered that habit necessary. Such situations the States of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia were in--large tracts of the most fertile lands\r\non the continent remained uncultivated for the want of population. It\r\nwas frequently advanced on the floor of Congress, how unhealthy those\r\nclimates were, and how impossible it was for northern constitutions to\r\nexist there. What, he asked, is to be done with this uncultivated\r\nterritory? Is it to remain a waste? Is the rice trade to be banished\r\nfrom our coasts? Are Congress willing to deprive themselves of the\r\nrevenue arising from that trade, and which is daily increasing, and to\r\nthrow this great advantage into the hands of other countries?\r\n\r\nLet us examine the use or the benefit of the resolutions contained in\r\nthe report. I call upon gentlemen to give me one single instance in\r\nwhich they can be of service. They are of no use to Congress. The\r\npowers of that body are already defined, and those powers cannot be\r\namended, confirmed or diminished by ten thousand resolutions. Is not\r\nthe first proposition of the report fully contained in the\r\nConstitution? Is not that the guide and rule of this legislature. A\r\nmultiplicity of laws is reprobated in any society, and tend but to\r\nconfound and perplex. How strange would a law appear which was to\r\nconfirm a law; and how much more strange must it appear for this body\r\nto pass resolutions to confirm the Constitution under which they sit!\r\nThis is the case with others of the resolutions.\r\n\r\nA gentleman from Maryland (Mr. STONE,) very properly observed, that\r\nthe Union had received the different States with all their ill habits\r\nabout them. This was one of these habits established long before the\r\nConstitution, and could not now be remedied. He begged Congress to\r\nreflect on the number on the continent who were opposed to this\r\nConstitution, and on the number which yet remained in the Southern\r\nStates. The violation of this compact they would seize on with\r\navidity; they would make a handle of it to cover their designs against\r\nthe government, and many good federalists, who would be injured by the\r\nmeasure, would be induced to join them: his heart was truly federal,\r\nand it always had been so, and he wished those designs frustrated. He\r\nbegged Congress to beware before they went too far: he called on them\r\nto attend to the interests of two whole States, as well as to the\r\nmemorials of a society of Quakers, who came forward to blow the\r\ntrumpet of sedition, and to destroy that Constitution which they had\r\nnot in the least contributed by personal service or supply to\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\nHe seconded Mr. TUCKER'S motion.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH (of S.C.) said, the gentlemen from Massachusetts, (Mr.\r\nGERRY,) had declared that it was the opinion of the select committee,\r\nof which he was a member, that the memorial of the Pennsylvania\r\nsociety, required Congress to violate the Constitution. It was not\r\nless astonishing to see Dr. FRANKLIN taking the lead in a business\r\nwhich looks so much like a persecution of the Southern inhabitants,\r\nwhen he recollected the parable he had written some time ago, with a\r\nview of showing the impropriety of one set of men persecuting others\r\nfor a difference of opinion. The parable was to this effect: an old\r\ntraveller, hungry and weary, applied to the patriarch Abraham for a\r\nnight's lodging. In conversation, Abraham discovered that the stranger\r\ndiffered with him on religious points, and turned him out of doors. In\r\nthe night God appeared unto Abraham, and said, where is the stranger?\r\nAbraham answered, I found that he did not worship the true God, and so\r\nI turned him out of doors. The Almighty thus rebuked the patriarch:\r\nHave I borne with him three-score and ten years, and couldst thou not\r\nbear with him one night? Has the Almighty, said Mr. SMITH, borne with\r\nus for more than three-score years and ten: he has even made our\r\ncountry opulent, and shed the blessings of affluence and prosperity on\r\nour land, notwithstanding all its slaves, and must we now be ruined on\r\naccount of the tender consciences of a few scrupulous individuals who\r\ndiffer from us on this point?\r\n\r\nMr. BOUDINOT agreed with the general doctrines of Mr. S., but could\r\nnot agree that the clause in the Constitution relating to the want of\r\npower in Congress to prohibit the importation of such persons as any\r\nof the States, _now existing_, shall think proper to admit, prior to\r\nthe year 1808, and authorizing a tax or duty on such importation not\r\nexceeding ten dollars for each person, did not extend to negro slaves.\r\nCandor required that he should acknowledge that this was the express\r\ndesign of the Constitution, and therefore Congress could not interfere\r\nin prohibiting the importation or promoting the emancipation of them,\r\nprior to that period. Mr. BOUDINOT observed, that he was well informed\r\nthat the tax or duty of ten dollars was provided, instead of the five\r\nper cent ad valorem, and was so expressly understood by all parties in\r\nthe Convention; that therefore it was the interest and duty of\r\nCongress to impose this tax, or it would not be doing justice to the\r\nStates, or equalizing the duties throughout the Union. If this was not\r\ndone, merchants might bring their whole capitals into this branch of\r\ntrade, and save paying any duties whatever. Mr. BOUDINOT observed,\r\nthat the gentleman had overlooked the prophecy of St. Peter, where he\r\nforetells that among other damnable heresies, \"Through covetousness\r\nshall they with feigned words make merchandize of you.\"\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--This petition, with others of a similar object, was committed\r\nto a select committee; that committee made a report; the report was\r\nreferred to a committee of the whole House, and discussed on four\r\nsuccessive days; it was then reported to the House with amendments,\r\nand by the House ordered to be inscribed in its Journals, and then\r\nlaid on the table.\r\n\r\nThat report, as amended in committee, is in the following words:\r\n\r\nThe committee to whom were referred sundry memorials from the people\r\ncalled Quakers, and also a memorial from the Pennsylvania Society for\r\npromoting the abolition of slavery, submit the following report, (as\r\namended in committee of the whole.)\r\n\r\n\"First: That the migration or importation of such persons as any of\r\nthe States now existing shall think proper to admit, cannot be\r\nprohibited by Congress prior to the year 1808.\"\r\n\r\n\"Secondly: That Congress have no power to interfere in the\r\nemancipation of slaves, or in the treatment of them, within any of the\r\nStates; it remaining with the several States alone to provide any\r\nregulations therein which humanity and true policy may require.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly: That Congress have authority to restrain the citizens of the\r\nUnited States from carrying on the African Slave trade, for the\r\npurpose of supplying foreigners with slaves, and of providing by\r\nproper regulations for the humane treatment, during their passage, of\r\nslaves imported by the said citizens into the States admitting such\r\nimportations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly: That Congress have also authority to prohibit foreigners\r\nfrom fitting out vessels in any part of the United States for\r\ntransporting persons from Africa to any foreign port.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nFriends of Freedom and Emancipation in the U. States.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Tenth Anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, held in\r\nthe city of New-York, May 7th, 1844,--after grave deliberation, and a\r\nlong and earnest discussion,--it was decided, by a vote of nearly\r\nthree to one of the members present, that fidelity to the cause of\r\nhuman freedom, hatred of oppression, sympathy for those who are held\r\nin chains and slavery in this republic, and allegiance to God, require\r\nthat the existing national compact should be instantly dissolved; that\r\nsecession from the government is a religious and political duty; that\r\nthe motto inscribed on the banner of Freedom should be, NO UNION WITH\r\nSLAVEHOLDERS; that it is impracticable for tyrants and the enemies of\r\ntyranny to coalesce and legislate together for the preservation of\r\nhuman rights, or the promotion of the interests of Liberty; and that\r\nrevolutionary ground should be occupied by all those who abhor the\r\nthought of doing evil that good may come, and who do not mean to\r\ncompromise the principles of Justice and Humanity.\r\n\r\nA decision involving such momentous consequences, so well calculated\r\nto startle the public mind, so hostile to the established order of\r\nthings, demands of us, as the official representatives of the American\r\nSociety, a statement of the reasons which led to it. This is due not\r\nonly to the Society, but also to the country and the world.\r\n\r\nIt is declared by the American people to be a self-evident truth,\r\n\"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed BY THEIR\r\nCREATOR with certain inalienable rights; that among these are _life_,\r\nLIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.\" It is further maintained by\r\nthem, that \"all governments derive their just powers from the consent\r\nof the governed;\" that \"whenever any form of government becomes\r\ndestructive of human rights, it is the right of the people to alter or\r\nto abolish it, and institute a new government, laying its foundation\r\non such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them\r\nshall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\" These\r\ndoctrines the patriots of 1776 sealed with their blood. They would not\r\nbrook even the menace of oppression. They held that there should be no\r\ndelay in resisting, at whatever cost or peril, the first encroachments\r\nof power on their liberties. Appealing to the great Ruler of the\r\nuniverse for the rectitude of their course, they pledged to each other\r\n\"their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor,\" to conquer or\r\nperish in their struggle to be free.\r\n\r\nFor the example which they set to all people subjected to a despotic\r\nsway, and the sacrifices which they made, their descendants cherish\r\ntheir memories with gratitude, reverence their virtues, honor their\r\ndeeds, and glory in their triumphs.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, therefore, for us to prove that a state of\r\nslavery is incompatible with the dictates of reason and humanity; or\r\nthat it is lawful to throw off a government which is at war with the\r\nsacred rights of mankind.\r\n\r\nWe regard this as indeed a solemn crisis, which requires of every man\r\nsobriety of thought, prophetic forecast, independent judgment,\r\ninvincible determination, and a sound heart. A revolutionary step is\r\none that should not be taken hastily, nor followed under the influence\r\nof impulsive imitation. To know what spirit they are of--whether they\r\nhave counted the cost of the warfare--what are the principles they\r\nadvocate--and how they are to achieve their object--is the first duty\r\nof revolutionists.\r\n\r\nBut, while circumspection and prudence are excellent qualities in\r\nevery great emergency, they become the allies of tyranny whenever they\r\nrestrain prompt, bold and decisive action against it.\r\n\r\nWe charge upon the present national compact, that it was formed at the\r\nexpense of human liberty, by a profligate surrender of principle, and\r\nto this hour is cemented with human blood.\r\n\r\nWe charge upon the American Constitution, that it contains provisions,\r\nand enjoins duties, which make it unlawful for freemen to take the\r\noath of allegiance to it, because they are expressly designed to favor\r\na slaveholding oligarchy, and, consequently, to make one portion of\r\nthe people a prey to another.\r\n\r\nWe charge upon the existing national government, that it is an\r\ninsupportable despotism, wielded by a power which is superior to all\r\nlegal and constitutional restraints--equally indisposed and unable to\r\nprotect the lives or liberties of the people--the prop and safeguard\r\nof American slavery.\r\n\r\nThese charges we proceed briefly to establish:\r\n\r\n1. It is admitted by all men of intelligence,--or if it be denied in\r\nany quarter, the records of our national history settle the question\r\nbeyond doubt,--that the American Union was effected by a guilty\r\ncompromise between the free and slaveholding States; in other words,\r\nby immolating the colored population on the altar of slavery, by\r\ndepriving the North of equal rights and privileges, and by\r\nincorporating the slave system into the government. In the expressive\r\nand pertinent language of scripture, it was \"a covenant with death,\r\nand an agreement with hell\"--null and void before God, from the first\r\nhour of its inception--the framers of which were recreant to duty, and\r\nthe supporters of which are equally guilty.\r\n\r\nIt was pleaded at the time of the adoption, it is pleaded now, that,\r\nwithout such a compromise there could have been no union; that,\r\nwithout union, the colonies would have become an easy prey to the\r\nmother country; and, hence, that it was an act of necessity,\r\ndeplorable indeed when viewed alone, but absolutely indispensable to\r\nthe safety of the republic.\r\n\r\nTo this we reply: The plea is as profligate as the act was tyrannical.\r\nIt is the jesuitical doctrine, that the end sanctifies the means. It\r\nis a confession of sin, but the denial of any guilt in its\r\nperpetration. It is at war with the government of God, and subversive\r\nof the foundations of morality. It is to make lies our refuge, and\r\nunder falsehood to hide ourselves, so that we may escape the\r\noverflowing scourge. \"Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, Judgment\r\nwill I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail\r\nshall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the\r\nhiding place.\" Moreover, \"because ye trust in oppression and\r\nperverseness, and stay thereon; therefore this iniquity shall be to\r\nyou as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose\r\nbreaking cometh suddenly at an instant. And he shall break it as the\r\nbreaking of the potter's vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not\r\nspare.\"\r\n\r\nThis plea is sufficiently broad to cover all the oppression and\r\nvillainy that the sun has witnessed in his circuit, since God said,\r\n\"Let there be light.\" It assumes that to be practicable, which is\r\nimpossible, namely, that there can be freedom with slavery, union with\r\ninjustice, and safety with bloodguiltiness. A union of virtue with\r\npollution is the triumph of licentiousness. A partnership between\r\nright and wrong, is wholly wrong. A compromise of the principles of\r\nJustice, is the deification of crime.\r\n\r\nBetter that the American Union had never been formed, than that it\r\nshould have been obtained at such a frightful cost! If they were\r\nguilty who fashioned it, but who could not foresee all its frightful\r\nconsequences, how much more guilty are they, who, in full view of all\r\nthat has resulted from it, clamor for its perpetuity! If it was sinful\r\nat the commencement, to adopt it on the ground of escaping a greater\r\nevil, is it not equally sinful to swear to support it for the same\r\nreason, or until, in process of time, it be purged from its\r\ncorruption?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the compromise alluded to, instead of effecting a union,\r\nrendered it impracticable; unless by the term union we are to\r\nunderstand the absolute reign of the slaveholding power over the whole\r\ncountry, to the prostration of Northern rights. In the just use of\r\nwords, the American Union is and always has been a sham--an imposture.\r\nIt is an instrument of oppression unsurpassed in the criminal history\r\nof the world. How then can it be innocently sustained? It is not\r\ncertain, it is not even probable, that if it had not been adopted, the\r\nmother country would have reconquered the colonies. The spirit that\r\nwould have chosen danger in preference to crime,--to perish with\r\njustice rather than live with dishonor,--to dare and suffer whatever\r\nmight betide, rather than sacrifice the rights of one human\r\nbeing,--could never have been subjugated by any mortal power. Surely\r\nit is paying a poor tribute to the valor and devotion of our\r\nrevolutionary fathers in the cause of liberty, to say that, if they\r\nhad sternly refused to sacrifice their principles, they would have\r\nfallen an easy prey to the despotic power of England.\r\n\r\nII. The American Constitution is the exponent of the national compact.\r\nWe affirm that it is an instrument which no man can innocently bind\r\nhimself to support, because its anti-republican and anti-Christian\r\nrequirements are explicit and peremptory; at least, so explicit that,\r\nin regard to all the clauses pertaining to slavery, they have been\r\nuniformly understood and enforced in the same way, by all the courts\r\nand by all the people; and so peremptory, that no individual\r\ninterpretation or authority can set them aside with impunity. It is\r\nnot a ball of clay, to be moulded into any shape that party\r\ncontrivance or caprice may choose it to assume. It is not a form of\r\nwords, to be interpreted in any manner, or to any extent, or for the\r\naccomplishment of any purpose, that individuals in office under it may\r\ndetermine. _It means precisely what those who framed and adopted it\r\nmeant_--NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS, _as a matter of bargain and\r\ncompromise_. Even if it can be construed to mean something else,\r\nwithout violence to its language, such construction is not to be\r\ntolerated _against the wishes of either party_. No just or honest use\r\nof it can be made, in opposition to the plain intention of its\r\nframers, _except to declare the contract at an end, and to refuse to\r\nserve under it_.\r\n\r\nTo the argument, that the words \"slaves\" and \"slavery\" are not to be\r\nfound in the Constitution, and therefore that it was never intended to\r\ngive any protection or countenance to the slave system, it is\r\nsufficient to reply, that though no such words are contained in that\r\ninstrument, other words were used intelligently and specifically, TO\r\nMEET THE NECESSITIES OF SLAVERY; and that these were adopted _in good\r\nfaith, to be observed until a constitutional change could be\r\neffected_. On this point, as to the design of certain provisions, no\r\nintelligent man can honestly entertain a doubt. If it be objected,\r\nthat though these provisions were meant to cover slavery, yet, as they\r\ncan fairly be interpreted to mean something exactly the reverse, it is\r\nallowable to give to them such an interpretation, _especially as the\r\ncause of freedom will thereby be promoted_--we reply, that this is to\r\nadvocate fraud and violence toward one of the contracting parties,\r\n_whose co-operation was secured only by an express agreement and\r\nunderstanding between them both, in regard to the clauses alluded to_;\r\nand that such a construction, if enforced by pains and penalties,\r\nwould unquestionably lead to a civil war, in which the aggrieved party\r\nwould justly claim to have been betrayed, and robbed of their\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\nAgain, if it be said, that those clauses, being immoral, are null and\r\nvoid--we reply, it is true they are not to be observed; but it is also\r\ntrue that they are portions of an instrument, the support of which, AS\r\nA WHOLE, is required by oath or affirmation; and, therefore, _because\r\nthey are immoral_, and BECAUSE OF THIS OBLIGATION TO ENFORCE\r\nIMMORALITY, no one can innocently swear to support the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAgain, if it be objected, that the Constitution was formed by the\r\npeople of the United States, in order to establish justice, to promote\r\nthe general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves\r\nand their posterity; and therefore, it is to be so construed as to\r\nharmonize with these objects; we reply, again, that its language is\r\n_not to be interpreted in a sense which neither of the contracting\r\nparties understood_, and which would frustrate every design of their\r\nalliance--to wit, _union at the expense of the colored population of\r\nthe country_. Moreover, nothing is more certain than that the preamble\r\nalluded to never included, in the minds of those who framed it, _those\r\nwho were then pining in bondage_--for, in that case, a general\r\nemancipation of the slaves would have instantly been proclaimed\r\nthroughout the United States. The words, \"secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to ourselves and our posterity,\" assuredly meant only the\r\nwhite population. \"To promote the general welfare,\" referred to their\r\nown welfare exclusively. \"To establish justice,\" was understood to be\r\nfor their sole benefit as slaveholders, and the guilty abettors of\r\nslavery. This is demonstrated by other parts of the same instrument,\r\nand by their own practice under it.\r\n\r\nWe would not detract aught from what is justly their due; but it is as\r\nreprehensible to give them credit for _what they did not possess_, as\r\nit is to rob them of what is theirs. It is absurd, it is false, it is\r\nan insult to the common sense of mankind, to pretend that the\r\nConstitution was intended to embrace the entire population of the\r\ncountry under its sheltering wings; or that the parties to it were\r\nactuated by a sense of justice and the spirit of impartial liberty; or\r\nthat it needs no alteration, but only a new interpretation, to make it\r\nharmonize with the object aimed at by its adoption. As truly might it\r\nbe argued, that because it is asserted in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, that all men are created equal, and endowed with an\r\ninalienable right to liberty, therefore none of its signers were\r\nslaveholders, and since its adoption, slavery has been banished from\r\nthe American soil! The truth is, our fathers were intent on securing\r\nliberty to _themselves_, without being very scrupulous as to the means\r\nthey used to accomplish their purpose. They were not actuated by the\r\nspirit of universal philanthropy; and though in words they recognized\r\noccasionally the brotherhood of the human race, _in practice_ they\r\ncontinually denied it. They did not blush to enslave a portion of\r\ntheir fellow-men, and to buy and sell them as cattle in the market,\r\nwhile they were fighting against the oppression of the mother country,\r\nand boasting of their regard for the rights of man. Why, then, concede\r\nto them virtues which they did not possess? _Why cling to the\r\nfalsehood, that they were no respecters of persons in the formation of\r\nthe government_?\r\n\r\nAlas! that they had no more fear of God, no more regard for man, in\r\ntheir hearts!  \"The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah [the\r\nNorth and South] is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood,\r\nand the city full of perverseness; for they say, the Lord hath\r\nforsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.\"\r\n\r\nWe proceed to a critical examination of the American Constitution, in\r\nits relations to slavery.\r\n\r\nIn ARTICLE 1, Section 9, it is declared--\"The migration or importation\r\nof such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper\r\nto admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress, prior to the year\r\none thousand eight hundred and eight; but a tax or duty may be imposed\r\non such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.\"\r\n\r\nIn this Section, it will be perceived, the phraseology is so guarded\r\nas not to imply, _ex necessitate_, any criminal intent or inhuman\r\narrangement; and yet no one has ever had the hardihood or folly to\r\ndeny, that it was clearly understood by the contracting parties, to\r\nmean that there should be no interference with the African slave\r\ntrade, on the part of the general government, until the year 1808.\r\nFor twenty years after the adoption of the Constitution, the citizens\r\nof the United States were to be encouraged and protected in the\r\nprosecution of that infernal traffic--in sacking and burning the\r\nhamlets of Africa--in slaughtering multitudes of the inoffensive\r\nnatives on the soil, kidnapping and enslaving a still greater\r\nproportion, crowding them to suffocation in the holds of the slave\r\nships, populating the Atlantic with their dead bodies, and subjecting\r\nthe wretched survivors to all the horrors of unmitigated bondage!\r\nThis awful covenant was strictly fulfilled; and though, since its\r\ntermination, Congress has declared the foreign slave traffic to be\r\npiracy, yet all Christendom knows that the American flag, instead of\r\nbeing the terror of the African slavers, has given them the most ample\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the 9th Section was agreed to, by the national\r\nconvention that formed the Constitution, is thus frankly avowed by the\r\nHon. LUTHER MARTIN[9] who was a prominent member of that body:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Speech before the Legislature of Maryland in 1787.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Eastern States, notwithstanding their aversion to slavery, (!)\r\nwere _very willing to indulge the Southern States_ at least with a\r\ntemporary liberty to prosecute the slave trade, provided the Southern\r\nStates would, in their turn, _gratify_ them by laying no restriction\r\non navigation acts; and, after a very little time, the committee, by a\r\ngreat majority, agreed on a report, _by which the general government\r\nwas to be prohibited from preventing the importation of slaves_ for a\r\nlimited time; and the restrictive clause relative to navigation acts\r\nwas to be omitted.\"\r\n\r\nBehold the iniquity of this agreement! how sordid were the motives\r\nwhich led to it! what a profligate disregard of justice and humanity,\r\non the part of those who had solemnly declared the inalienable right\r\nof all men to be free and equal, to be a self-evident truth!\r\n\r\nIt is due to the national convention to say, that this Section was not\r\nadopted \"without considerable opposition.\"  Alluding to it, Mr. MARTIN\r\nobserves--\r\n\r\n\"It was said that we had just assumed a place among independent\r\nnations in consequence of our opposition to the attempts of Great\r\nBritain to _enslave us_: that this opposition was grounded upon the\r\npreservation of those rights to which God and nature has entitled us,\r\nnot in _particular_, but in _common with all the rest of mankind_;\r\nthat we had appealed to the Supreme Being for his assistance, as the\r\nGod of freedom, who could not but approve our efforts to preserve the\r\nrights which he had thus imparted to his creatures; that now, when we\r\nscarcely had risen from our knees, from supplicating his aid and\r\nprotection in forming our government over a free people, a government\r\nformed pretendedly on the principles of liberty, and for its\r\npreservation,--in that government to have a provision, not only\r\nputting it out of its power to restrain and prevent the slave trade,\r\neven encouraging that most infamous traffic, by giving the States\r\npower and influence in the Union in proportion as they cruelly and\r\nwantonly sport with the rights of their fellow-creatures, ought to be\r\nconsidered as a solemn mockery of, and insult to, that God whose\r\nprotection we had then implored, and could not fail to hold us up in\r\ndetestation, and render us contemptible to every true friend of\r\nliberty in the world. It was said it ought to be considered that\r\nnational crimes can only be and frequently are, punished in this world\r\nby _national punishments_, and that the continuance of the slave\r\ntrade, and thus giving it a national sanction, and encouragement,\r\nought to be considered as justly exposing us to the displeasure and\r\nvengeance of Him who is equally Lord of all, and who views with equal\r\neye the poor _African slave_ and his _American master_![10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: How terribly and justly has this guilty nation been\r\nscourged, since these words were spoken, on account of slavery and the\r\nslave trade!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was urged that, by this system, we were giving the general\r\ngovernment full and absolute power to regulate commerce, under which\r\ngeneral power it would have a right to restrain, or totally prohibit,\r\nthe slave trade: it must, therefore, appear to the world absurd and\r\ndisgraceful to the last degree that we should except from the exercise\r\nof that power the only branch of commerce which is unjustifiable in\r\nits nature, and contrary to the rights of mankind. That, on the\r\ncontrary, we ought rather to prohibit expressly, in our Constitution,\r\nthe further importation of slaves, and to authorize the general\r\ngovernment, from time to time, to make such regulations as should be\r\nthought most advantageous for the gradual abolition of slavery, and\r\nthe emancipation of the slaves which are already in the States. That\r\nslavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism, and has a\r\ntendency to destroy those principles on which it is supported, as it\r\nlessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind, and habituates us to\r\ntyranny and oppression. It was further urged that, by this system of\r\ngovernment, every State is to be protected both from foreign invasion\r\nand from domestic insurrections; that, from this consideration, it was\r\nof the utmost importance it should have a power to restrain the\r\nimportation of slaves, since in proportion as the number of slaves\r\nwere increased in any State, in the same proportion the State is\r\nweakened and exposed to foreign invasion or domestic insurrection; and\r\nby so much less will it be able to protect itself against either, and\r\ntherefore will by so much the more, want aid from, and be a burden to,\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n\"It was further said, that, as in this system, we were giving the\r\ngeneral government a power, under the idea of national character, or\r\nnational interest, to regulate even our weights and measures, and have\r\nprohibited all possibility of emitting paper money, and passing\r\ninsolvent laws, &c., it must appear still more extraordinary that we\r\nshould prohibit the government from interfering with the slave trade,\r\nthan which nothing could so materially affect both our national honor\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\n\"These reasons influenced me, both on the committee and in convention,\r\nmost decidedly to oppose and vote against the clause, as it now makes\r\na part of the system.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Secret Proceedings, p. 64.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy had it been for this nation, had these solemn considerations\r\nbeen heeded by the framers of the Constitution! But for the sake of\r\nsecuring some local advantages, they chose to do evil that good might\r\ncome, and to make the end sanctify the means. They were willing to\r\nenslave others, that they might secure their own freedom. They did\r\nthis deed deliberately, with their eyes open, with all the facts and\r\nconsequences arising therefrom before them, in violation of all their\r\nheaven-attested declarations, and in atheistical distrust of the\r\noverruling power of God. \"The Eastern States were very willing to\r\n_indulge_ the Southern States\" in the unrestricted prosecution of\r\ntheir piratical traffic, provided in return they could be _gratified_\r\nby no restriction being laid on navigation acts!!--Had there been no\r\nother provision of the Constitution justly liable to objection, this\r\none alone rendered the support of that instrument incompatible with\r\nthe duties which men owe to their Creator, and to each other. It was\r\nthe poisonous infusion in the cup, which, though constituting but a\r\nvery slight portion of its contents, perilled the life of every one\r\nwho partook of it.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked to what purpose are these animadversions, since the\r\nclause alluded to has long since expired by its own limitation--we\r\nanswer, that, if at any time the foreign slave trade could be\r\n_constitutionally_ prosecuted, it may yet be renewed, under the\r\nConstitution, at the pleasure of Congress, whose prohibitory statute\r\nis liable to be reversed at any moment, in the frenzy of Southern\r\nopposition to emancipation. It is ignorantly supposed that the bargain\r\nwas, that the traffic _should cease_ in 1808; but the only thing\r\nsecured by it was, the _right_ of Congress (not any obligation) to\r\nprohibit it at that period. If, therefore, Congress had not chosen to\r\nexercise that right, _the traffic might have been prolonged\r\nindefinitely under the Constitution._ The right to destroy any\r\nparticular branch of commerce, implies the right to re-establish it.\r\nTrue, there is no probability that the African slave trade will ever\r\nagain be legalized by the national government; but no credit is due\r\nthe framers of the Constitution on this ground; for, while they threw\r\naround it all the sanction and protection of the national character\r\nand power for twenty years, _they set no bounds to its continuance by\r\nany positive constitutional prohibition._\r\n\r\nAgain, the adoption of such a clause, and the faithful execution\r\nof it, prove what was meant by the words of the preamble--\"to form\r\na more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,\r\nprovide for the common defence, promote the general welfare,\r\nand secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity\"--namely, that the parties to the Constitution regarded only\r\ntheir own rights and interests, and never intended that its language\r\nshould be so interpreted as to interfere with slavery, or to make it\r\nunlawful for one portion of the people to enslave another, _without an\r\nexpress alteration in that instrument, in the manner therein set\r\nforth._ While, therefore, the Constitution remains as it was\r\noriginally adopted, they who swear to support it are bound to comply\r\nwith all its provisions, as a matter of allegiance. For it avails\r\nnothing to say, that some of those provisions are at war with the law\r\nof God and the rights of man, and therefore are not obligatory.\r\nWhatever may be their character, they are _constitutionally_\r\nobligatory; and whoever feels that he cannot execute them, or swear to\r\nexecute them, without committing sin, has no other choice left than to\r\nwithdraw from the government, or to violate his conscience by taking\r\non his lips an impious promise. The object of the Constitution is not\r\nto define _what is the law of God_, but WHAT IS THE WILL OF THE\r\nPEOPLE--which will is not to be frustrated by an ingenious moral\r\ninterpretation, by those whom they have elected to serve them.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1, Sect. 2, provides--\"Representatives and direct taxes shall\r\nbe apportioned among the several States, which may be included within\r\nthis Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be\r\ndetermined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including\r\nthose bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not\r\ntaxed, _three-fifths of all other persons_.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as in the clause we have already examined, veiled beneath a form\r\nof words as deceitful as it is unmeaning in a truly democratic\r\ngovernment, is a provision for the safety, perpetuity and augmentation\r\nof the slaveholding power--a provision scarcely less atrocious than\r\nthat which related to the African slave trade, and almost as\r\nafflictive in its operation--a provision still in force, with no\r\npossibility of its alteration, so long as a majority of the slave\r\nStates choose to maintain their slave system--a provision which, at\r\nthe present time, enables the South to have twenty-five additional\r\nrepresentatives in Congress on the score of property, while the North\r\nis not allowed to have one--a provision which concedes to the\r\noppressed three-fifths of the political power which is granted to all\r\nothers, and then puts this power into the hands of their oppressors,\r\nto be wielded by them for the more perfect security of their tyrannous\r\nauthority, and the complete subjugation of the non-slaveholding\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nReferring to this atrocious bargain, ALEXANDER HAMILTON remarked in\r\nthe New York Convention--\r\n\r\n\"The first thing objected to, is that clause which allows a\r\nrepresentation for three-fifths of the negroes. Much has been said of\r\nthe impropriety of representing men who have no will of their own:\r\nwhether this be _reasoning_ or _declamation_, (!!) I will not presume\r\nto say. It is the _unfortunate_ situation of the Southern States to\r\nhave a great part of their population as well as _property_, in\r\nblacks. The regulation complained of was one result of _the spirit of\r\naccommodation_ which governed the Convention; and without this\r\n_indulgence_, NO UNION COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN FORMED. But, sir,\r\nconsidering some _peculiar advantages_ which we derive from them, it\r\nis entirely JUST that they should be _gratified_.--The Southern States\r\npossess certain staples, tobacco, rice, indigo, &c.--which must be\r\n_capital_ objects in treaties of commerce with foreign nations; and\r\nthe advantage which they necessarily procure in these treaties will be\r\nfelt throughout all the States.\"\r\n\r\nIf such was the patriotism, such the love of liberty, such the\r\nmorality of ALEXANDER HAMILTON, what can be said of the character of\r\nthose who were far less conspicuous than himself in securing American\r\nindependence, and in framing the American Constitution?\r\n\r\nListen, now, to the opinions of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, respecting the\r\nconstitutional clause now under consideration:--\r\n\r\n\"'In outward show, it is a representation of persons in bondage; in\r\nfact, it is a representation of their masters,--the oppressor\r\nrepresenting the oppressed.'--'Is it in the compass of human\r\nimagination to devise a more perfect exemplification of the art of\r\ncommitting the lamb to the tender custody of the wolf?'--'The\r\nrepresentative is thus constituted, not the friend, agent and trustee\r\nof the person whom he represents, but the most inveterate of his\r\nfoes.'--'It was _one_ of the curses from that Pandora's box, adjusted\r\nat the time, as usual, by a _compromise_, the whole advantage of which\r\ninured to the benefit of the South, and to aggravate the burthens of\r\nthe North.'--'If there be a parallel to it in human history, it can\r\nonly be that of the Roman Emperors, who, from the days when Julius\r\nCaesar substituted a military despotism in the place of a republic,\r\namong the offices which they always concentrated upon themselves, was\r\nthat of tribune of the people. A Roman Emperor tribune of the people,\r\nis an exact parallel to that feature in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates which makes the master the representative of his slave.'--'The\r\nConstitution of the United States expressly prescribes that no title\r\nof nobility shall be granted by the United States. The spirit of this\r\ninterdict is not a rooted antipathy to the grant of mere powerless\r\nempty _titles_, but to titles of _nobility_; to the institution of\r\nprivileged orders of men. But what order of men under the most\r\nabsolute of monarchies, or the most aristocratic of republics, was\r\never invested with such an odious and unjust privilege as that of the\r\nseparate and exclusive representation of less than half a million\r\nowners of slaves, in the Hall of this House, in the chair of the\r\nSenate, and in the Presidential mansion?'--'This investment of power\r\nin the owners of one species of property concentrated in the highest\r\nauthorities of the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of the\r\ntwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privileged order of men\r\nin the community, more adverse to the rights of all, and more\r\npernicious to the interests of the whole, than any order of nobility\r\never known. To call government thus constituted a Democracy, is to\r\ninsult the understanding of mankind. To call it an Aristocracy, is to\r\ndo injustice to that form of government. Aristocracy is the government\r\nof the _best_. Its standard qualification for accession to power is\r\n_merit_, ascertained by popular election, recurring at short intervals\r\nof time. If even that government is prone to degenerate into tyranny,\r\nwhat must be the character of that form of polity in which the\r\nstandard qualification for access to power is wealth in the possession\r\nof slaves? It is doubly tainted with the infection of riches and of\r\nslavery. _There is no name in the language of national jurisprudence\r\nthat can define it_--no model in the records of ancient history, or in\r\nthe political theories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. It\r\nwas introduced into the Constitution of the United States by an\r\nequivocation--a representation of property under the name of persons.\r\nLittle did the members of the Convention from the free States imagine\r\nor foresee what a sacrifice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of\r\nthis concession.'--'The House of Representatives of the U. States\r\nconsists of 223 members--all, by the _letter_ of the Constitution,\r\nrepresentatives only of _persons_, as 135 of them really are; but the\r\nother 88, equally representing the _persons_ of their constituents, by\r\nwhom they are elected, also represent, under the name of _other\r\npersons_, upwards of two and a half millions of _slaves_, held as the\r\n_property_ of less than half a million of the white constituents, and\r\nvalued at twelve hundred millions of dollars. Each of these 88 members\r\nrepresents in fact the whole of that mass of associated wealth, and\r\nthe persons and exclusive interests of its owners; all thus knit\r\ntogether, like the members of a moneyed corporation, with a capital\r\nnot of thirty-five or forty or fifty, but of twelve hundred millions\r\nof dollars, exhibiting the most extraordinary exemplification of the\r\nanti-republican tendencies of associated wealth that the world ever\r\nsaw.'--'Here is one class of men, consisting of not more than\r\none-fortieth part of the whole people, not more than one-thirtieth\r\npart of the free population, exclusively devoted to their personal\r\ninterests identified with their own as slaveholders of the same\r\nassociated wealth, and wielding by their votes, upon every question of\r\ngovernment or of public policy, two-fifths of the whole power of the\r\nHouse. In the Senate of the Union, the proportion of the slaveholding\r\npower is yet greater. By the influence of slavery, in the States where\r\nthe institution is tolerated, over their elections, no other than a\r\nslaveholder can rise to the distinction of obtaining a seat in the\r\nSenate; and thus, of the 52 members of the Federal Senate, 26 are\r\nowners of slaves, and as effectively representatives of that interest\r\nas the 88 member elected by them to the House.'--'By this process it\r\nis that all political power in the States is absorbed and engrossed by\r\nthe owners of _slaves_, and the overruling policy of the States is\r\nshaped to strengthen and consolidate their domination. The\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial authorities are all in their\r\nhands--the preservation, propagation, and perpetuation of the black\r\ncode of slavery--every law of the legislature becomes a link in the\r\nchain of the slave; every executive act a rivet to his hapless fate;\r\nevery judicial decision a perversion of the human intellect to the\r\njustification of _wrong_.'--'Its reciprocal operation upon the\r\ngovernment of the nation is, to establish an artificial majority in\r\nthe slave representation over that of the free people, in the American\r\nCongress, and thereby to make the PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION, AND\r\nPERPETUATION OF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRIT OF THE NATIONAL\r\nGOVERNMENT.'--'The result is seen in the fact that, at this day, the\r\nPresident of the United States, the President of the Senate, the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, and five out of nine of the\r\nJudges of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the United States, are not\r\nonly citizens of slaveholding States, but individual slaveholders\r\nthemselves. So are, and constantly have been, with scarcely an\r\nexception, all the members of both Houses of Congress from the\r\nslaveholding States; and so are, in immensely disproportionate\r\nnumbers, the commanding officers of the army and navy; the officers of\r\nthe customs; the registers and receivers of the land offices, and the\r\npost-masters throughout the slaveholding States.--The Biennial\r\nRegister indicates the birth-place of all the officers employed in the\r\ngovernment of the Union. If it were required to designate the owners\r\nof this species of property among them, it would be little more than a\r\ncatalogue of slaveholders.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is confessed by Mr. ADAMS, alluding to the national convention\r\nthat framed the Constitution, that \"the delegation from the free\r\nStates, in their extreme anxiety to conciliate the ascendancy of the\r\nSouthern slaveholder, did listen to a _compromise between right and\r\nwrong--between freedom and slavery_; of the ultimate fruits of which\r\nthey had no conception, but which already even now is urging the Union\r\nto its inevitable ruin and dissolution, by a civil, servile, foreign\r\nand Indian war, all combined in one; a war, the essential issue of\r\nwhich will be between freedom and slavery, and in which the unhallowed\r\nstandard of slavery will be the desecrated banner of the North\r\nAmerican Union--that banner, first unfurled to the breeze, inscribed\r\nwith the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence.\"\r\n\r\nHence, to swear to support the Constitution of the United States, _as\r\nit is_, is to make \"a compromise between right and wrong,\" and to wage\r\nwar against human liberty. It is to recognize and honor as republican\r\nlegislators _incorrigible men-stealers_, MERCILESS TYRANTS, BLOOD\r\nTHIRSTY ASSASSINS, who legislate with deadly weapons about their\r\npersons, such as pistols, daggers, and bowie-knives, with which they\r\nthreaten to murder any Northern senator or representative who shall\r\ndare to stain their _honor_, or interfere with their rights! They\r\nconstitute a banditti more fierce and cruel than any whose atrocities\r\nare recorded on the pages of history or romance. To mix with them on\r\nterms of social or religious fellowship, is to indicate a low state of\r\nvirtue; but to think of administering a free government by their\r\nco-operation, is nothing short of insanity.\r\n\r\nArticle 4, Section 2, declares,--\"No person held to service or labor\r\nin one State, _under the laws thereof_, escaping into another, shall,\r\nin consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from\r\nsuch service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party\r\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a third clause, which, like the other two, makes no mention of\r\nslavery or slaves, in express terms; and yet, like them, was\r\nintelligently framed and mutually understood by the parties to the\r\nratification, and intended both to protect the slave system and to\r\nrestore runaway slaves. It alone makes slavery a national institution,\r\na national crime, and all the people who are not enslaved, the\r\nbody-guard over those whose liberties have been cloven down. This\r\nagreement, too, has been fulfilled to the letter by the North.\r\n\r\nUnder the Mosaic dispensation it was imperatively commanded,--\"Thou\r\nshalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from\r\nhis master unto thee: he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in\r\nthat place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh\r\nhim best: thou shalt not oppress him.\" The warning which the prophet\r\nIsaiah gave to oppressing Moab was of a similar kind: \"Take counsel,\r\nexecute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the\r\nnoon-day; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. Let mine\r\noutcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face\r\nof the spoiler.\" The prophet Obadiah brings the following charge\r\nagainst treacherous Edom, which is precisely applicable to this guilty\r\nnation:--\"For thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall come\r\nover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. In the day that thou\r\nstoodst on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away\r\ncaptive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast\r\nlots upon Jerusalem, _even thou wast as one of them_. But thou\r\nshouldst not have looked on the day of thy brother, in the day that he\r\nbecame a stranger; neither shouldst thou have rejoiced over the\r\nchildren of Judah, in the day of their destruction; neither shouldst\r\nthou have spoken proudly in the day of distress; neither shouldst thou\r\nhave _stood in the cross-way, to cut off those of his that did\r\nescape_; neither shouldst thou have _delivered up those of his that\r\ndid remain_, in the day of distress.\"\r\n\r\nHow exactly descriptive of this boasted republic is the impeachment of\r\nEdom by the same prophet! \"The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee,\r\nthou whose habitation is high; that saith in thy heart, Who shall\r\nbring me down to the ground? Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle,\r\nand though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee\r\ndown, saith the Lord.\" The emblem of American pride and power is the\r\n_eagle_, and on her banner she has mingled _stars_ with its _stripes_.\r\nHer vanity, her treachery, her oppression, her self-exaltation, and\r\nher defiance of the Almighty, far surpass the madness and wickedness\r\nof Edom. What shall be her punishment? Truly, it may be affirmed of\r\nthe American people, (who live not under the Levitical but Christian\r\ncode, and whose guilt, therefore, is the more awful, and their\r\ncondemnation the greater,) in the language of another prophet--\"They\r\nall lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.\r\nThat they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh,\r\nand the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his\r\nmischievous desire: _so they wrap it up_.\" Likewise of the colored\r\ninhabitants of this land it may be said,--\"This is a people robbed and\r\nspoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in\r\nprison-houses; they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil,\r\nand none saith, Restore.\"\r\n\r\nBy this stipulation, the Northern States are made the hunting ground\r\nof slave-catchers, who may pursue their victims with blood-hounds, and\r\ncapture them with impunity wherever they can lay their robber hands\r\nupon them. At least twelve or fifteen thousand runaway slaves are now\r\nin Canada, exiled from their native land, because they could not find,\r\nthroughout its vast extent, a single road on which they could dwell in\r\nsafety, _in consequence of this provision of the Constitution_? How is\r\nit possible, then, for the advocates of liberty to support a\r\ngovernment which gives over to destruction one-sixth part of the whole\r\npopulation?\r\n\r\nIt is denied by some at the present day, that the clause which has\r\nbeen cited, was intended to apply to runaway slaves. This indicates,\r\neither ignorance, or folly, or something worse. JAMES MADISON, as one\r\nof the framers of the Constitution, is of some authority on this\r\npoint. Alluding to that instrument, in the Virginia convention, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Another clause _secures us that property which we now possess_. At\r\npresent, if any slave elopes to any of those States where slaves are\r\nfree, _he becomes emancipated by their laws_; for the laws of the\r\nStates are _uncharitable_ (!) to one another in this respect; but in\r\nthis constitution, 'No person held to service or labor in one State,\r\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence\r\nof any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or\r\nlabor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\r\nservice or labor may be due.' THIS CLAUSE WAS EXPRESSLY INSERTED TO\r\nENABLE OWNERS OF SLAVES TO RECLAIM THEM. _This is a better security\r\nthan any that now exists_. No power is given to the general government\r\nto interpose with respect to the property in slaves now held by the\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same convention, alluding to the same clause, Gov. RANDOLPH\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Every one knows that slaves are held to service or labor. And, when\r\nauthority is given to owners of slaves to _vindicate their property_,\r\ncan it be supposed they can be deprived of it? If a citizen of this\r\nState, in consequence of this clause, can take his runaway slave in\r\nMaryland, can it be seriously thought that, after taking him and\r\nbringing him home, he could be made free?\"\r\n\r\nIt is objected, that slaves are held as property, and therefore, as\r\nthe clause refers to persons, it cannot mean slaves. But this is\r\ncriticism against fact. Slaves are recognized not merely as property,\r\nbut also as persons--as having a mixed character--as combining the\r\nhuman with the brutal. This is paradoxical, we admit; but slavery is a\r\nparadox--the American Constitution is a paradox--the American Union is\r\na paradox--the American Government is a paradox; and if any one of\r\nthese is to be repudiated on that ground, they all are. That it is the\r\nduty of the friends of freedom to deny the binding authority of them\r\nall, and to secede from them all, we distinctly affirm. After the\r\nindependence of this country had been achieved, the voice of God\r\nexhorted the people, saying, \"Execute true judgment, and show mercy\r\nand compassion, every man to his brother: and oppress not the widow,\r\nnor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you\r\nimagine evil against his brother in your heart. But they refused to\r\nhearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that\r\nthey should not hear; yea, they made their hearts as an adamant\r\nstone.\" \"Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord. Shall not\r\nmy soul be avenged on such a nation as this?\"\r\n\r\nWhatever doubt may have rested on any honest mind, respecting the\r\nmeaning of the clause in relation to persons held to service or labor,\r\nmust have been removed by the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, in the case of Prigg versus the State of\r\nPennsylvania. By that decision, any Southern slave-catcher is\r\nempowered to seize and convey to the South, without hindrance or\r\nmolestation on the part of the State, and without any legal process\r\nduly obtained and served, any person or persons, irrespective of caste\r\nor complexion, whom he may choose to claim as runaway slaves; and if,\r\nwhen thus surprised and attacked, or on their arrival South, they\r\ncannot prove by legal witnesses, that they are freemen, their doom is\r\nsealed! Hence the free colored population of the North are specially\r\nliable to become the victims of this terrible power, and all the other\r\ninhabitants are at the mercy of prowling kidnappers, because there are\r\nmultitudes of white as well as black slaves on Southern plantations,\r\nand slavery is no longer fastidious with regard to the color of its\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nAs soon as that appalling decision of the Supreme Court was\r\nenunciated, in the name of the Constitution, the people of the North\r\nshould have risen _en masse_, if for no other cause, and declared the\r\nUnion at an end; and they would have done so, if they had not lost\r\ntheir manhood, and their reverence for justice and liberty.\r\n\r\nIn the 4th Sect. of Art. IV., the United States guarantee to protect\r\nevery State in the Union \"against _domestic violence_.\" By the 8th\r\nSection of Article I., Congress is empowered \"to provide for calling\r\nforth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, _suppress\r\ninsurrections_, and repel invasions.\" These provisions, however\r\nstrictly they may apply to cases of disturbance among the white\r\npopulation, were adopted with special reference to the slave\r\npopulation, for the purpose of keeping them in their chains by the\r\ncombined military force of the country; and were these repealed, and\r\nthe South left to manage her slaves as best she could, a servile\r\ninsurrection would ere long be the consequence, as general as it would\r\nunquestionably be successful. Says Mr. Madison, respecting these\r\nclauses:--\r\n\r\n\"On application of the legislature or executive, as the case may be,\r\nthe militia of the other States are to be called to suppress domestic\r\ninsurrections. Does this bar the States from calling forth their own\r\nmilitia? No; but it gives them a _supplementary_ security to suppress\r\ninsurrections and domestic violence.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to Patrick Henry's objection, as urged against the\r\nConstitution in the Virginia convention, that there was no power left\r\nto the _States_ to quell an insurrection of slaves, as it was wholly\r\nvested in Congress, George Nicholas asked:--\r\n\r\n\"Have they it now? If they have, does the constitution take it away?\r\nIf it does, it must be in one of the three clauses which have been\r\nmentioned by the worthy member. The first clause gives the general\r\ngovernment power to call them out when necessary. Does this take it\r\naway from the States? No! but it _gives an additional security_; for,\r\nbeside the power in the State governments to use their own militia, it\r\nwill be _the duty of the general government_ to aid them WITH THE\r\nSTRENGTH OF THE UNION, when called for.\"\r\n\r\nThis solemn guaranty of security to the slave system, caps the climax\r\nof national barbarity, and stains with human blood the garments of all\r\nthe people. In consequence of it, that system has multiplied its\r\nvictims from seven hundred thousand to nearly three millions--a vast\r\namount of territory has been purchased, in order to give it extension\r\nand perpetuity--several new slave States have been admitted into the\r\nUnion--the slave trade has been made one of the great branches of\r\nAmerican commerce--the slave population, though over-worked, starved,\r\nlacerated, branded, maimed, and subjected to every form of deprivation\r\nand every species of torture, have been overawed and crushed,--or,\r\nwhenever they have attempted to gain their liberty by revolt, they\r\nhave been shot down and quelled by the strong arm of the national\r\ngovernment; as, for example, in the case of Nat Turner's insurrection\r\nin Virginia, when the naval and military forces of the government were\r\ncalled into active service. Cuban bloodhounds have been purchased with\r\nthe money of the people, and imported and used to hunt slave fugitives\r\namong the everglades of Florida. A merciless warfare has been waged\r\nfor the extermination or expulsion of the Florida Indians, because\r\nthey gave succor to these poor hunted fugitives--a warfare which has\r\ncost the nation several thousand lives, and forty millions of dollars.\r\nBut the catalogue of enormities is too long to be recapitulated in the\r\npresent address.\r\n\r\nWe have thus demonstrated that the compact between the North and the\r\nSouth embraces every variety of wrong and outrage,--is at war with God\r\nand man, cannot be innocently supported, and deserves to be\r\nimmediately annulled. In behalf of the Society which we represent, we\r\ncall upon all our fellow-citizens, who believe it is right to obey God\r\nrather than man, to declare themselves peaceful revolutionists, and to\r\nunite with us under the stainless banner of Liberty, having for its\r\nmotto--\"EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL--NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleaded that the Constitution provides for its own amendment;\r\nand we ought to use the elective franchise to effect this object.\r\nTrue, there is such a proviso; but, until the amendment be made, that\r\ninstrument is binding as it stands. Is it not to violate every moral\r\ninstinct, and to sacrifice principle to expediency, to argue that we\r\nmay swear to steal, oppress and murder by wholesale, because it may be\r\nnecessary to do so only for the time being, and because there is some\r\nremote probability that the instrument which requires that we should\r\nbe robbers, oppressors and murderers, may at some future day be\r\namended in these particulars? Let us not palter with our consciences\r\nin this manner--let us not deny that the compact was conceived in sin\r\nand brought forth in iniquity--let us not be so dishonest, even to\r\npromote a good object, as to interpret the Constitution in a manner\r\nutterly at variance with the intentions and arrangements of the\r\ncontracting parties; but, confessing the guilt of the nation,\r\nacknowledging the dreadful specifications in the bond, washing our\r\nhands in the waters of repentance from all further participation in\r\nthis criminal alliance, and resolving that we will sustain none other\r\nthan a free and righteous government, let us glory in the name of\r\nrevolutionists, unfurl the banner of disunion, and consecrate our\r\ntalents and means to the overthrow of all that is tyrannical in the\r\nland,--to the establishment of all that is free, just, true and\r\nholy,--to the triumph of universal love and peace. If, in utter\r\ndisregard of the historical facts which have been cited, it is still\r\nasserted, that the Constitution needs no amendment to make it a free\r\ninstrument, adapted to all the exigencies of a free people, and was\r\nnever intended to give any strength or countenance to the slave\r\nsystem--the indignant spirit of insulted Liberty replies;--\"What\r\nthough the assertion be true? Of what avail is a mere piece of\r\nparchment? In itself, though it be written all over with words of\r\ntruth and freedom--Though its provisions be as impartial and just as\r\nwords can express, or the imagination paint--though it be as pure as\r\nthe Gospel, and breathe only the spirit of Heaven--it is powerless; it\r\nhas no executive vitality: it is a lifeless corpse, even though\r\nbeautiful in death. I am famishing for lack of bread! How is my\r\nappetite relieved by holding up to my gaze a painted loaf? I am\r\nmanacled, wounded, bleeding, dying! What consolation is it to know,\r\nthat they who are seeking to destroy my life, profess in words to be\r\nmy friends?\" If the liberties of the people have been betrayed--if\r\njudgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off, and\r\ntruth has fallen in the streets, and equity cannot enter--if the\r\nprinces of the land are roaring lions, the judges evening wolves, the\r\npeople light and treacherous persons, the priests covered with\r\npollution--if we are living under a frightful despotism, which scoffs\r\nat all constitutional restraints, and wields the resources of the\r\nnation to promote its own bloody purposes--tell us not that the forms\r\nof freedom are still left to us! \"Would such tameness and submission\r\nhave freighted the May-Flower for Plymouth Rock? Would it have\r\nresisted the Stamp Act, the Tea Tax, or any of those entering wedges\r\nof tyranny with which the British government sought to rive the\r\nliberties of America? The wheel of the Revolution would have rusted on\r\nits axle, if a spirit so weak had been the only power to give it\r\nmotion. Did our fathers say, when their rights and liberties were\r\ninfringed--\"_Why, what is done cannot be undone_. That is the first\r\nthought.\" No, it was the last thing they thought of: or, rather, it\r\nnever entered their minds at all. They sprang to the conclusion at\r\nonce--\"_What is done_ SHALL _be undone_. That is our FIRST and ONLY\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Is water running in our veins? Do we remember still Old Plymouth\r\n  Rock, and Lexington, and famous Bunker Hill? The debt we owe our\r\n  fathers' graves? and to the yet unborn, Whose heritage ourselves must\r\n  make a thing of pride or scorn?\r\n\r\n  Gray Plymouth Rock hath yet a tongue, and Concord is not dumb; And\r\n  voices from our fathers' graves and from the future come: They call on\r\n  us to stand our ground--they charge us still to be Not only free from\r\n  chains ourselves, but foremost to make free!\"\r\n\r\nIt is of little consequence who is on the throne, if there be behind\r\nit a power mightier than the throne. It matters not what is the theory\r\nof the government, if the practice of the government be unjust and\r\ntyrannical. We rise in rebellion against a despotism incomparably more\r\ndreadful than that which induced the colonists to take up arms against\r\nthe mother country; not on account of a three-penny tax on tea, but\r\nbecause fetters of living iron are fastened on the limbs of millions\r\nof our countrymen, and our most sacred rights are trampled in the\r\ndust. As citizens of the State, we appeal to the State in vain for\r\nprotection and redress. As citizens of the United States, we are\r\ntreated as outlaws in one half of the country, and the national\r\ngovernment consents to our destruction. We are denied the right of\r\nlocomotion, freedom of speech, the right of petition, the liberty of\r\nthe press, the right peaceably to assemble together to protest against\r\noppression and plead for liberty--at least in thirteen States of the\r\nUnion. If we venture, as avowed and unflinching abolitionists, to\r\ntravel South of Mason and Dixon's line, we do so at the peril of our\r\nlives. If we would escape torture and death, on visiting any of the\r\nslave States, we must stifle our conscientious convictions, bear no\r\ntestimony against cruelty and tyranny, suppress the struggling\r\nemotions of humanity, divest ourselves of all letters and papers\r\nof an anti-slavery character, and do homage to the slaveholding\r\npower--or run the risk of a cruel martyrdom! These are appalling\r\nand undeniable facts. Three millions of the American people are\r\ncrushed under the American Union! They are held as slaves--trafficked\r\nas merchandise--registered as goods and chattels! The government gives\r\nthem no protection--the government is their enemy--the government\r\nkeeps them in chains! There they lie bleeding--we are prostrate by\r\ntheir side--in their sorrows and sufferings we participate--their\r\nstripes are inflicted on our bodies, their shackles are fastened on\r\nour limbs, their cause is ours! The Union which grinds them to the\r\ndust rests upon us, and with them we will struggle to overthrow it!\r\nThe Constitution, which subjects them to hopeless bondage, is one that\r\nwe cannot swear to support! Our motto is, \"NO UNION WITH\r\nSLAVEHOLDERS,\" either religious or political. They are the fiercest\r\nenemies of mankind, and the bitterest foes of God! We separate from\r\nthem not in anger, not in malice, not for a selfish purpose, not to do\r\nthem an injury, not to cease warning, exhorting, reproving them for\r\ntheir crimes, not to leave the perishing bondman to his fate--O no!\r\nBut to clear our skirts of innocent blood--to give the oppressor no\r\ncountenance--to signify our abhorrence of injustice and cruelty--to\r\ntestify against an ungodly compact--to cease striking hands with\r\nthieves and consenting with adulterers--to make no compromise with\r\ntyranny--to walk worthily of our high profession--to increase our\r\nmoral power over the nation--to obey God and vindicate the Gospel of\r\nhis Son--to hasten the downfall of slavery in America, and throughout\r\nthe world!\r\n\r\nWe are not acting under a blind impulse. We have carefully counted the\r\ncost of this warfare, and are prepared to meet its consequences. It\r\nwill subject us to reproach, persecution, infamy--it will prove a\r\nfiery ordeal to all who shall pass through it--it may cost us our\r\nlives. We shall be ridiculed as fools, scorned as visionaries, branded\r\nas disorganizers, reviled as madmen, threatened and perhaps punished\r\nas traitors. But we shall bide our time. Whether safety or peril,\r\nwhether victory or defeat, whether life or death be ours, believing\r\nthat our feet are planted on an eternal foundation, that our position\r\nis sublime and glorious, that our faith in God is rational and\r\nsteadfast, that we have exceeding great and precious promises on which\r\nto rely, THAT WE ARE IN THE RIGHT, we shall not falter nor be\r\ndismayed, \"though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be\r\ncarried into the midst of the sea,\"--though our ranks be thinned to\r\nthe number of \"three hundred men.\" Freemen! are you ready for the\r\nconflict? Come what may, will you sever the chain that binds you to a\r\nslaveholding government, and declare your independence? Up, then, with\r\nthe banner of revolution! Not to shed blood--not to injure the person\r\nor estate of any oppressor--not by force and arms to resist any\r\nlaw--not to countenance a servile insurrection--not to wield any\r\ncarnal weapons! No--ours must be a bloodless strife, excepting _our_\r\nblood be shed--for we aim, as did Christ our leader, not to destroy\r\nmen's lives, but to save them--to overcome evil with good--to conquer\r\nthrough suffering for righteousness' sake--to set the captive free by\r\nthe potency of truth!\r\n\r\nSecede, then, from the government. Submit to its exactions, but pay\r\nit no allegiance, and give it no voluntary aid. Fill no offices under\r\nit. Send no senators or representatives to the National or State\r\nlegislature; for what you cannot conscientiously perform yourself, you\r\ncannot ask another to perform as your agent. Circulate a declaration\r\nof DISUNION FROM SLAVEHOLDERS, throughout the country. Hold mass\r\nmeetings--assemble in conventions--nail your banners to the mast!\r\n\r\nDo you ask what can be done, if you abandon the ballot box? What did\r\nthe crucified Nazarene do without the elective franchise? What did\r\nthe apostles do? What did the glorious army of martyrs and confessors\r\ndo? What did Luther and his intrepid associates do? What can women\r\nand children do? What has Father Matthew done for teetotalism? What\r\nhas Daniel O'Connell done for Irish repeal? \"Stand, having your loins\r\ngirt about with truth, and having on the breast-plate of\r\nrighteousness,\" and arrayed in the whole armor of God!\r\n\r\nThe form of government that shall succeed the present government of\r\nthe United States, let time determine. It would he a waste of time to\r\nargue that question, until the people are regenerated and turned from\r\ntheir iniquity. Ours is no anarchical movement, but one of order and\r\nobedience. In ceasing from oppression, we establish liberty. What is\r\nnow fragmentary, shall in due time be crystallized, and shine like a\r\ngem set in the heavens, for a light to all coming ages.\r\n\r\nFinally--we believe that the effect of this movement will be,--First,\r\nto create discussion and agitation throughout the North; and these\r\nwill lead to a general perception of its grandeur and importance.\r\n\r\nSecondly, to convulse the slumbering South like an earthquake, and\r\nconvince her that her only alternative is, to abolish slavery, or be\r\nabandoned by that power on which she now relies for safety.\r\n\r\nThirdly, to attack the slave power in its most vulnerable point, and\r\nto carry the battle to the gate.\r\n\r\nFourthly, to exalt the moral sense, increase the moral power, and\r\ninvigorate the moral constitution of all who heartily espouse it.\r\n\r\nWe reverently believe that, in withdrawing from the American Union, we\r\nhave the God of justice with us. We know that we have our enslaved\r\ncountrymen with us. We are confident that all free hearts will be\r\nwith us. We are certain that tyrants and their abettors will be\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety,\r\n\r\nWM. LLOYD GARRISON, _President_.\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS,     }_Secretaries_.\r\nMARIA WESTON CHAPMAN, }\r\n\r\nBoston, May 20, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM FRANCIS JACKSON.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, 4th July, 1844.\r\n\r\n_To His Excellency George N. Briggs:_\r\n\r\nSIR--Many years since, I received from the Executive of the\r\nCommonwealth a commission as Justice of the Peace. I have held the\r\noffice that it conferred upon me till the present time, and have found\r\nit a convenience to myself, and others. It might continue to be so,\r\ncould I consent longer to hold it. But paramount considerations\r\nforbid, and I herewith transmit to you my commission, respectfully\r\nasking you to accept my resignation.\r\n\r\nWhile I deem it a duty to myself to take this step, I feel called on\r\nto state the reasons that influence me.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the duties of the office in question, I complied with\r\nthe requirements of the law, by taking an oath \"_to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States_.\" I regret that I ever took that\r\noath. Had I then as maturely considered its full import, and the\r\nobligations under which it is understood, and meant to lay those who\r\ntake it, as I have done since, I certainly never would have taken it,\r\nseeing, as I now do, that the Constitution of the United States\r\ncontains provisions calculated and intended to foster, cherish, uphold\r\nand perpetuate _slavery_. It pledges the country to guard and protect\r\nthe slave system so long as the slaveholding States choose to retain\r\nit. It regards the slave code as lawful in the States which enact it.\r\nStill more, \"it has done that, which, until its adoption, was never\r\nbefore done for African slavery. It took it out of its former category\r\nof municipal law and local life; adopted it as a national institution,\r\nspread around it the broad and sufficient shield of national law, and\r\nthus gave to slavery a national existence.\" Consequently, the oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States is a solemn promise to\r\ndo that which is morally wrong; that which is a violation of the\r\nnatural rights of man, and a sin in the sight of God.\r\n\r\nI am not in this matter, constituting myself a judge of others. I do\r\nnot say that no honest man can take such an oath, and abide by it. I\r\nonly say, that _I_ would not now deliberately take it; and that,\r\nhaving inconsiderately taken it; I can no longer suffer it to lie upon\r\nmy soul. I take back the oath, and ask you, sir, to receive back the\r\ncommission, which was the occasion of my taking it.\r\n\r\nI am aware that my course in this matter is liable to be regarded as\r\nsingular, if not censurable; and I must, therefore, be allowed to make\r\na more specific statement of those _provisions of the Constitution_\r\nwhich support the enormous wrong, the heinous sin of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe very first Article of the Constitution takes slavery at once under\r\nits legislative protection, as a basis of representation in the\r\npopular branch of the National Legislature. It regards slaves under\r\nthe description \"of all other _persons_\"--as of only three-fifths of\r\nthe value of free persons; thus to appearance undervaluing them in\r\ncomparison with freemen. But its dark and involved phraseology seems\r\nintended to blind us to the consideration, that those underrated\r\nslaves are merely a _basis_, not the _source_ of representation; that\r\nby the laws of all the States where they live, they are regarded not\r\nas _persons_, but as _things_; that they are not the _constituency_ of\r\nthe representative, but his property; and that the necessary effect of\r\nthis provision of the Constitution is, to take legislative power out\r\nof the hands of _men_, as such, and give it to the mere possessors of\r\ngoods and chattels. Fixing upon thirty thousand persons, as the\r\nsmallest number that shall send one member into the House of\r\nRepresentatives, it protects slavery by distributing legislative power\r\nin a free and in a slave State thus: To a congressional district in\r\nSouth Carolina, containing fifty thousand slaves, claimed as the\r\nproperty of five hundred whites, who hold, on an average, one hundred\r\napiece, it gives one Representative in Congress; to a district in\r\nMassachusetts containing a population of thirty thousand five hundred,\r\none Representative is assigned. But inasmuch as a slave is never\r\npermitted to vote, the fifty thousand persons in a district in\r\nCarolina form no part of \"the constituency;\" _that_ is found only in\r\nthe five hundred free persons. Five hundred freemen of Carolina could\r\nsend one Representative to Congress, while it would take thirty\r\nthousand five hundred freemen of Massachusetts, to do the same thing:\r\nthat is, one slaveholder in Carolina is clothed by the Constitution\r\nwith the same political power and influence in the Representatives\r\nHall at Washington, as sixty Massachusetts men like you and me, who\r\n\"eat their bread in the sweat of their own brows.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1830, and the _ratio_ of representation\r\nbased upon that, slave property added twenty-five members to the House\r\nof Representatives. And as it has been estimated, (as an\r\napproximation to the truth,) that the two and a half million slaves in\r\nthe United States are held as property by about two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand persons--giving an average of ten slaves to each slaveholder,\r\nthose twenty-five Representatives, each chosen, at most by only ten\r\nthousand voters, and probably by less than three-fourths of that\r\nnumber, were the representatives not only of the two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand persons who chose them, but of property which, five years\r\nago, when slaves were lower in market, than at present, were\r\nestimated, by the man who is now the most prominent candidate for the\r\nPresidency, at twelve hundred millions of dollars--a sum, which, by\r\nthe natural increase of five years, and the enhanced value resulting\r\nfrom a more prosperous state of the planting interest, cannot now be\r\nless than fifteen hundred millions of dollars. All this vast amount of\r\nproperty, as it is \"peculiar,\" is also identical in its character. In\r\nCongress, as we have seen, it is animated by one spirit, moves in one\r\nmass, and is wielded with one aim; and when we consider that tyranny\r\nis always timid, and despotism distrustful, we see that this vast\r\nmoney power would be false to itself, did it not direct all its eyes\r\nand hands, and put forth all its ingenuity and energy, to one\r\nend--self-protection and self-perpetuation. And this it has ever done.\r\nIn all the vibrations of the political scale, whether in relation to a\r\nBank or Sub-Treasury, Free Trade or a Tariff, this immense power has\r\nmoved, and will continue to move, in one mass, for its own protection.\r\n\r\nWhile the weight of the slave influence is thus felt in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, \"in the Senate of the Union,\" says JOHN QUINCY ADAMS,\r\n\"the proportion of slaveholding power is still greater. By the\r\ninfluence of slavery in the States where the institution is tolerated,\r\nover their elections, no other than a slaveholder can rise to the\r\ndistinction of obtaining a seat in the Senate; and thus, of the\r\nfifty-two members of the federal Senate, twenty-six are owners of\r\nslaves, and are as effectually representatives of that interest, as\r\nthe eighty-eight members elected by them to the House\"\r\n\r\nThe dominant power which the Constitution gives to the slave interest,\r\nas thus seen and exercised in the _Legislative Halls_ of our nation,\r\nis equally obvious and obtrusive in every other department of the\r\nNational government.\r\n\r\nIn the _Electoral colleges_, the same cause produces the same\r\neffect--the same power is wielded for the same purpose, as in the\r\nHalls of Congress. Even the preliminary nominating conventions, before\r\nthey dare name a candidate for the highest office in the gift of the\r\npeople, must ask of the Genius of slavery, to what votary she will\r\nshow herself propitious. This very year, we see both the great\r\npolitical parties doing homage to the slave power, by nominating each\r\na slaveholder for the chair of State. The candidate of one party\r\ndeclares, \"I should have opposed, and would continue to oppose, any\r\nscheme whatever of emancipation, either gradual or immediate;\" and\r\nadds, \"It is not true, and I rejoice that it is not true, that either\r\nof the two great parties of this country has any design or aim at\r\nabolition. I should deeply lament it, if it were true.\"[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Henry Clay's speech in the United States Senate in 1839,\r\nand confirmed at Raleigh, N.C. 1844.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other party nominates a man who says, \"I have no hesitation in\r\ndeclaring that I am in favor of the immediate re-annexation of Texas\r\nto the territory and government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThus both the political parties, and the candidates of both, vie with\r\neach other, in offering allegiance to the slave power, as a condition\r\nprecedent to any hope of success in the struggle for the executive\r\nchair; a seat that, for more than three-fourths of the existence of\r\nour constitutional government, has been occupied by a slaveholder.\r\n\r\nThe same stern despotism overshadows even the sanctuaries of\r\n_justice_. Of the nine Justices of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, five are slaveholders, and of course, must be faithless to\r\ntheir own interest, as well as recreant to the power that gives them\r\nplace, or must, so far as _they_ are concerned, give both to law and\r\nconstitution such a construction as shall justify the language of John\r\nQuincy Adams, when he says--\"The legislative, executive, and judicial\r\nauthorities, are all in their hands--for the preservation,\r\npropagation, and perpetuation of the black code of slavery. Every law\r\nof the legislature becomes a link in the chain of the slave; every\r\nexecutive act a rivet to his hapless fate; every judicial decision a\r\nperversion of the human intellect to the justification of wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThus by merely adverting but briefly to the theory and the practical\r\neffect of this clause of the Constitution, that I have sworn to\r\nsupport, it is seen that it throws the political power of the nation\r\ninto the hands of the slaveholders; a body of men, which, however it\r\nmay be regarded by the Constitution as \"persons,\" is in fact and\r\npractical effect, a vast moneyed corporation, bound together by an\r\nindissoluble unity of interest, by a common sense of a common danger;\r\ncounselling at all times for its common protection; wielding the whole\r\npower, and controlling the destiny of the nation.\r\n\r\nIf we look into the legislative halls, slavery is seen in the chair of\r\nthe presiding officer of each; and controlling the action of both.\r\nSlavery occupies, by prescriptive right, the Presidential chair. The\r\nparamount voice that comes from the temple of national justice, issues\r\nfrom the lips of slavery. The army is in the hands of slavery, and at\r\nher bidding, must encamp in the everglades of Florida, or march from\r\nthe Missouri to the borders of Mexico, to look after her interests in\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThe navy, even that part that is cruising off the coast of Africa, to\r\nsuppress the foreign slave trade, is in the hands of slavery.\r\n\r\nFreemen of the North, who have even dared to lift up their voice\r\nagainst slavery, cannot travel through the slave States, but at the\r\nperil of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of freemen are forbidden, on the floor of\r\nCongress, to remonstrate against the encroachments of slavery, or to\r\npray that she would let her poor victims go.\r\n\r\nI renounce my allegiance to a Constitution that enthrones such a\r\npower, wielded for the purpose of depriving me of my rights, of\r\nrobbing my countrymen of their liberties, and of securing its own\r\nprotection, support and perpetuation.\r\n\r\nPassing by that clause of the Constitution, which restricted Congress\r\nfor twenty years, from passing any law against the African slave\r\ntrade, and which gave authority to raise a revenue on the stolen sons\r\nof Africa, I come to that part of the fourth article, which guarantees\r\nprotection against \"_domestic violence_,\" which pledges to the South\r\nthe military force of the country, to protect the masters against\r\ntheir insurgent slaves, and binds us, and our children, to shoot down\r\nour fellow-countrymen, who may rise, in emulation of our revolutionary\r\nfathers, to vindicate their inalienable \"right to life, _liberty_, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness,\"--this clause of the Constitution, I say\r\ndistinctly, I never will support.\r\n\r\nThat part of the Constitution which provides for the surrender of\r\nfugitive slaves, I never have supported and never will. I will join in\r\nno slave-hunt. My door shall stand open, as it has long stood, for the\r\npanting and trembling victim of the slave-hunter. When I shut it\r\nagainst him, may God shut the door of his mercy against me! Under this\r\nclause of the Constitution, and designed to carry it into effect,\r\nslavery has demanded that laws should be passed, and of such a\r\ncharacter, as have left the free citizen of the North without\r\nprotection for his own liberty. The question, whether a man seized in\r\na free State as a slave, _is_ a slave or not, the law of Congress does\r\nnot allow a jury to determine: but refers it to the decision of a\r\nJudge of a United States' Court, or even of the humblest State\r\nmagistrate, it may be, upon the testimony or affidavit of the party\r\nmost deeply interested to support the claim. By virtue of this law,\r\nfreemen have been seized and dragged into perpetual slavery--and\r\nshould I be seized by a slave-hunter in any part of the country where\r\nI am not personally known, neither the Constitution nor laws of the\r\nUnited States would shield me from the same destiny.\r\n\r\nThese, sir, are the specific parts of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, which in my opinion are essentially vicious, hostile at once\r\nto the liberty and to the morals of the nation. And these are the\r\nprincipal reasons of my refusal any longer to acknowledge my\r\nallegiance to it, and of my determination to revoke my oath to support\r\nit. I cannot, in order to keep the law of man, break the law of God,\r\nor solemnly call him to witness my promise that I will break it.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Constitution provides for its own amendment, and\r\nthat by this process, all the guarantees of Slavery may be expunged.\r\nBut it will be time enough to swear to support it when this is done.\r\nIt cannot be right to do so, until these amendments are made.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that the framers of the Constitution did studiously\r\nkeep the words \"Slave\" and \"Slavery\" from its face. But to do our\r\nconstitutional fathers justice, while they forebore--from very\r\nshame--to give the word \"Slavery\" a place in the Constitution, they\r\ndid not forbear--again to do them justice--to give place in it to the\r\n_thing_. They were careful to wrap up the idea, and the substance of\r\nSlavery, in the clause for the surrender of the fugitive, though they\r\nsacrificed justice in doing so.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that this clause touching \"persons held to\r\nservice or labor,\" not only operates practically, under the Judicial\r\nconstruction, for the protection of the slave interest; but that it\r\nwas _intended_ so to operate by the farmers of the Constitution. The\r\nhighest Judicial authorities--Chief Justice SHAW, of the Supreme Court\r\nof Massachusetts, in the LATIMER case, and Mr. Justice STORY, in the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, in the case of _Prigg_ vs. _The\r\nState of Pennsylvania_,--tell us, I know not on what evidence, that\r\nwithout this \"compromise,\" this security for Southern slaveholders,\r\n\"the Union could not have been formed.\" And there is still higher\r\nevidence, not only that the framers of the Constitution meant by this\r\nclause to protect slavery, but that they did this, knowing that\r\nslavery was wrong. Mr. MADISON[13] informs us that the clause in\r\nquestion, as it came of the hands of Dr. JOHNSON, the chairman of the\r\n\"committee on style,\" read thus: \"No person legally held to service,\r\nor labor, in one State, escaping into another, shall,\" &c. and that\r\nthe word \"legally\" was struck out, and the words \"under the laws\r\nthereof\" inserted after the word \"State,\" in compliance with the wish\r\nof some, who thought the term _legal_ equivocal, and favoring the idea\r\nthat slavery was legal \"_in a moral view_.\" A conclusive proof that,\r\nalthough future generations might apply that clause to other kinds of\r\n\"service or labor,\" when slavery should have died out, or been killed\r\noff by the young spirit of liberty, which was _then_ awake and at work\r\nin the land; still, slavery was what they were wrapping up in\r\n\"equivocal\" words; and wrapping it up for its protection and safe\r\nkeeping: a conclusive proof that the framers of the Constitution were\r\nmore careful to protect themselves in the judgment of coming\r\ngenerations, from the charge of ignorance, than of sin; a conclusive\r\nproof that they knew that slavery was _not_ \"legal in a moral view,\"\r\nthat it was a violation of the moral law of God; and yet knowing and\r\nconfessing its immorality, they dared to make this stipulation for its\r\nsupport and defence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Madison Papers, p. 1589.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis language may sound harsh to the ears of those who think it a part\r\nof their duty, as citizens, to maintain that whatever the patriots of\r\nthe Revolution did, was right; and who hold that we are bound to _do_\r\nall the iniquity that they covenanted for us that we _should_ do. But\r\nthe claims of truth and right are paramount to all other claims.\r\n\r\nWith all our veneration for our constitutional fathers, we must\r\nadmit,--for they have left on record their own confession of it,--that\r\nin this part of their work they _intended_ to hold the shield of their\r\nprotection over a wrong, knowing that it was a wrong. They made a\r\n\"compromise\" which they had no right to make--a compromise of moral\r\nprinciple for the sake of what they probably regarded as \"political\r\nexpediency.\" I am sure they did not know--no man could know, or can\r\nnow measure, the extent, or the consequences of the wrong that they\r\nwere doing. In the strong language of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS,[14] in\r\nrelation to the article fixing the basis of representation, \"Little\r\ndid the members of the Convention, from the free States, imagine or\r\nforesee what a sacrifice to Moloch was hidden under the mask of this\r\nconcession.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See his Report on the Massachusetts Resolutions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI verily believe that, giving all due consideration to the benefits\r\nconferred upon this nation by the Constitution, its national unity,\r\nits swelling masses of wealth, its power, and the external prosperity\r\nof its multiplying millions; yet the moral injury that has been done,\r\nby the countenance shown to slavery; by holding over that tremendous\r\nsin the shield of the Constitution, and thus breaking down in the eyes\r\nof the nation the barrier between right and wrong; by so tenderly\r\ncherishing slavery as, in less than the life of a man, to multiply her\r\nchildren from half a million to nearly three millions; by enacting\r\noaths from those who occupy prominent stations in society, that they\r\nwill violate at once the rights of man and the law of God; by\r\nsubstituting itself as a rule of right, in place of the moral laws of\r\nthe universe;--thus in effect, dethroning the Almighty in the hearts\r\nof this people and setting up another sovereign in his stead--more\r\nthan outweighs it all. A melancholy and monitory lesson this, to all\r\ntime-serving and temporizing statesmen! A striking illustration of the\r\n_impolicy_ of sacrificing _right_ to any considerations of expediency!\r\nYet, what better than the evil effects that we have seen, could the\r\nauthors of the Constitution have reasonably expected, from the\r\nsacrifice of right, in the concessions they made to slavery? Was it\r\nreasonable in them to expect that, after they had introduced a vicious\r\nelement into the very Constitution of the body politic which they were\r\ncalling into life, it would not exert its vicious energies? Was it\r\nreasonable in them to expect that, after slavery had been corrupting\r\nthe public morals for a whole generation, their children would have\r\ntoo much virtue to _use_ for the defence of slavery, a power which\r\nthey themselves had not too much virtue to _give_? It is dangerous for\r\nthe sovereign power of a State to license immorality; to hold the\r\nshield of its protection over anything that is not \"legal in a moral\r\nview.\" Bring into your house a benumbed viper, and lay it down upon\r\nyour warm hearth, and soon it will not ask you into which room it may\r\ncrawl. Let Slavery once lean upon the supporting arm, and bask in the\r\nfostering smile of the State, and you will soon see, as we now see,\r\nboth her minions and her victims multiply apace, till the politics,\r\nthe morals, the liberties, even the religion of the nation, are\r\nbrought completely under her control.\r\n\r\nTo me, it appears that the virus of slavery, introduced into the\r\nConstitution of our body politic, by a few slight punctures, has now\r\nso pervaded and poisoned the whole system of our National Government,\r\nthat literally there is no health in it. The only remedy that I can\r\nsee for the disease, is to be found in the _dissolution of the\r\npatient_.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, both in theory and practice, is\r\nso utterly broken down by the influence and effects of slavery, so\r\nimbecile for the highest good of the nation, and so powerful for evil,\r\nthat I can give no voluntary assistance in holding it up any longer.\r\n\r\nHenceforth it is dead to me, and I to it. I withdraw all profession of\r\nallegiance to it, and all my voluntary efforts to sustain it. The\r\nburdens that it lays upon me, while it is held up by others, I shall\r\nendeavor to bear patiently, yet acting with reference to a higher law,\r\nand distinctly declaring, that while I retain my own liberty, I will\r\nbe a party to no compact, which helps to rob any other man of his.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your friend,\r\n\r\nFRANCIS JACKSON\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM\r\n\r\nMR. WEBSTER'S SPEECH\r\n\r\nAT NIBLO'S GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\"We have slavery, already, amongst us. The Constitution found it among\r\nus; it recognized it and gave it SOLEMN GUARANTIES. To the full extent\r\nof these guaranties we are all bound, in honor, in justice, and by the\r\nConstitution. All the stipulations, contained in the Constitution, _in\r\nfavor of the slaveholding States_ which are already in the Union,\r\nought to be fulfilled, and so far as depends on me, shall be\r\nfulfilled, in the fulness of their spirit, and to the exactness of\r\ntheir letter.\" !!!\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM\r\n\r\nJOHN Q. ADAMS'S ADDRESS\r\n\r\nAT NORTH BRIDGEWATER, NOVEMBER 6, 1844.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of the Constitution of the United States, were the\r\nrestoration of credit and reputation, to the country--the revival of\r\ncommerce, navigation, and ship-building--the acquisition of the means\r\nof discharging the debts of the Revolution, and the protection and\r\nencouragement of the infant and drooping manufactures of the country.\r\nAll this, however, as is now well ascertained, was insufficient to\r\npropitiate the rulers of the Southern States to the adoption of the\r\nConstitution. What they specially wanted was _protection_.--Protection\r\nfrom the powerful and savage tribes of Indians within their borders,\r\nand who were harassing them with the most terrible of wars--and\r\nprotection from their own negroes--protection from their\r\ninsurrections--protection from their escape--protection even to the\r\ntrade by which they were brought into the country--protection, shall I\r\nnot blush to say, protection to the very bondage by which they were\r\nheld. Yes! it cannot be denied--the slaveholding lords of the South\r\nprescribed, as a condition of their assent to the Constitution, three\r\nspecial provisions to secure the perpetuity of their dominion over\r\ntheir slaves. The first was the immunity for twenty years of\r\npreserving the African slave-trade; the second was the stipulation to\r\nsurrender fugitive slaves--an engagement positively prohibited by the\r\nlaws of God, delivered from Sinai; and thirdly, the exaction fatal to\r\nthe principles of popular representation, of a representation for\r\nslaves--for articles of merchandise, under the name of persons.\r\n\r\nThe reluctance with which the freemen of the North submitted to the\r\ndictation of these conditions, is attested by the awkward and\r\nambiguous language in which they are expressed. The word slave is most\r\ncautiously and fastidiously excluded from the whole instrument. A\r\nstranger, who should come from a foreign land, and read the\r\nConstitution of the United States, would not believe that slavery or a\r\nslave existed within the borders of our country. There is not a word\r\nin the Constitution _apparently_ bearing upon the condition of\r\nslavery, nor is there a provision but would be susceptible of\r\npractical execution, if there were not a slave in the land.\r\n\r\nThe delegates from South Carolina and Georgia distinctly avowed that,\r\nwithout this guarantee of protection to their property in slaves, they\r\nwould not yield their assent to the Constitution; and the freemen of\r\nthe North, reduced to the alternative of departing from the vital\r\nprinciple of their liberty, or of forfeiting the Union itself, averted\r\ntheir faces, and with trembling hand subscribed the bond.\r\n\r\nTwenty years passed away--the slave markets of the South were\r\nsaturated with the blood of African bondage, and from midnight of the\r\n31st of December, 1807, not a slave from Africa was suffered ever more\r\nto be introduced upon our soil. But the internal traffic was still\r\nlawful, and the _breeding_ States soon reconciled themselves to a\r\nprohibition which gave them the monopoly of the interdicted trade, and\r\nthey joined the full chorus of reprobation, to punish with death the\r\nslave-trader from Africa, while they cherished and shielded and\r\nenjoyed the precious profits of the American slave-trade exclusively\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this unhappy result of their concession had not altogether\r\nescaped the foresight of the freemen of the North; but their intense\r\nanxiety for the preservation of the whole Union, and the habit already\r\nformed of yielding to the somewhat peremptory and overbearing tone\r\nwhich the relation of master and slave welds into the nature of the\r\nlord, prevailed with them to overlook this consideration, the internal\r\nslave-trade having scarcely existed, while that with Africa had been\r\nallowed. But of one consequence which has followed from the slave\r\nrepresentation, pervading the whole organic structure of the\r\nConstitution, they certainly were not prescient; for if they had been,\r\nnever--no, never would they have consented to it.\r\n\r\nThe representation, ostensibly of slaves, under the name of persons,\r\nwas in its operation an exclusive grant of power to one class of\r\nproprietors, owners of one species of property, to the detriment of\r\nall the rest of the community. This species of property was odious in\r\nits nature, held in direct violation of the natural and inalienable\r\nrights of man, and of the vital principles of Christianity; it was all\r\naccumulated in one geographical section of the country, and was all\r\nheld by wealthy men, comparatively small in numbers, not amounting to\r\na tenth part of the free white population of the States in which it\r\nwas concentrated.\r\n\r\nIn some of the ancient, and in some modern republics, extraordinary\r\npolitical power and privileges have been invested in the owners of\r\nhorses but then these privileges and these powers have been granted\r\nfor the equivalent of extraordinary duties and services to the\r\ncommunity, required of the favored class. The Roman knights\r\nconstituted the cavalry of their armies, and the bushels of rings\r\ngathered by Hannibal from their dead bodies, after the battle of\r\nCannae, amply prove that the special powers conferred upon them were\r\nno gratuitous grants. But in the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthe political power invested in the owners of slaves is entirely\r\ngratuitous. No extraordinary service is required of them; they are, on\r\nthe contrary, themselves grievous burdens upon the community, always\r\nthreatened with the danger of insurrections, to be smothered in the\r\nblood of both parties, master and slave, and always depressing the\r\ncondition of the poor free laborer, by competition with the labor of\r\nthe slave. The property in horses was the gift of God to man, at the\r\ncreation of the world; the property in slaves is property acquired and\r\nheld by crimes, differing in no moral aspect from the pillage of a\r\nfreebooter, and to which no lapse of time can give a prescriptive\r\nright. You are told that this is no concern of yours, and that the\r\nquestion of freedom and slavery is exclusively reserved to the\r\nconsideration of the separate States. But if it be so, as to the mere\r\nquestion of right between master and slave, it is of tremendous\r\nconcern to you that this little cluster of slave-owners should\r\npossess, besides their own share in the representative hall of the\r\nnation, the exclusive privilege of appointing two-fifths of the whole\r\nnumber of the representatives of the people. This is now your\r\ncondition, under that delusive ambiguity of language and of principle,\r\nwhich begins by declaring the representation in the popular branch of\r\nthe legislature a representation of persons, and then provides that\r\none class of persons shall have neither part nor lot in the choice of\r\ntheir representatives; but their elective franchise shall be\r\ntransferred to their masters, and the oppressors shall represent the\r\noppressed. The same perversion of the representative principle\r\npollutes the composition of the colleges of electors of President and\r\nVice President of the United States, and every department of the\r\ngovernment of the Union is thus tainted at its source by the gangrene\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens,--with a body of men thus composed, for legislators\r\nand executors of the laws, what will, what must be, what has been your\r\nlegislation? The numbers of freemen constituting your nation are much\r\ngreater than those of the slaveholding States, bond and free. You have\r\nat least three-fifths of the whole population of the Union. Your\r\ninfluence on the legislation and the administration of the government\r\nought to be in the proportion of three to two--But how stands the\r\nfact? Besides the legitimate portion of influence exercised by the\r\nslaveholding States by the measure of their numbers, here is an\r\nintrusive influence in every department, by a representation nominally\r\nof persons, but really of property, ostensibly of slaves, but\r\neffectively of their masters, overbalancing your superiority of\r\nnumbers, adding two-fifths of supplementary power to the two-fifths\r\nfairly secured to them by the compact, CONTROLLING AND OVERRULING THE\r\nWHOLE ACTION OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AT HOME AND ABROAD, and warping it to\r\nthe sordid private interest and oppressive policy of 300,000 owners of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the adoption of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, the institution of domestic slavery has been becoming more and\r\nmore the abhorrence of the civilized world. But in proportion as it\r\nhas been growing odious to all the rest of mankind, it has been\r\nsinking deeper and deeper into the affections of the holders of slaves\r\nthemselves. The cultivation of cotton and of sugar, unknown in the\r\nUnion at the establishment of the Constitution, has added largely to\r\nthe pecuniary value of the slave. Aud the suppression of the African\r\nslave-trade as piracy upon pain of death, by securing the benefit of a\r\nmonopoly to the virtuous slaveholders of the ancient dominion, has\r\nturned her heroic tyrannicides into a community of slave-breeders for\r\nsale, and converted the land of GEORGE WASHINGTON, PATRICK HENRY,\r\nRICHARD HENRY LEE, and THOMAS JEFFERSON, into a great barracoon--a\r\ncattle-show of human beings, an emporium, of which the staple articles\r\nof merchandise are the flesh and blood, the bones and sinews of\r\nimmortal man.\r\n\r\nOf the increasing abomination of slavery in the unbought hearts of men\r\nat the time when the Constitution of the United States was formed,\r\nwhat clearer proof could be desired, than that the very same year in\r\nwhich that charter of the land was issued, the Congress of the\r\nConfederation, with not a tithe of the powers given by the people to\r\nthe Congress of the new compact, actually abolished slavery for ever\r\nthroughout the whole Northwestern territory, without a remonstrance or\r\na murmur. But in the articles of confederation, there was no guaranty\r\nfor the property of the slaveholder--no double representation of him\r\nin the Federal councils--no power of taxation--no stipulation for the\r\nrecovery of fugitive slaves. But when the powers of _government_ came\r\nto be delegated to the Union, the South--that is, South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia--refused their subscription to the parchment, till it should\r\nbe saturated with the infection of slavery, which no fumigation could\r\npurify, no quarantine could extinguish. The freemen of the North gave\r\nway, and the deadly venom of slavery was infused into the Constitution\r\nof freedom. Its first consequence has been to invert the first\r\nprinciple of Democracy, that the will of the majority of numbers shall\r\nrule the land. By means of the double representation, the minority\r\ncommand the whole, and a KNOT OF SLAVEHOLDERS GIVE THE LAW AND\r\nPRESCRIBE THE POLICY OF THE COUNTRY. To acquire this superiority of a\r\nlarge majority of freemen, a persevering system of engrossing nearly\r\nall the seats of power and place, is constantly for a long series of\r\nyears pursued, and you have seen, in a period of fifty-six years, the\r\nChief-magistracy of the Union held, during forty-four of them, by the\r\nowners of slaves. The Executive department, the Army and Navy, the\r\nSupreme Judicial Court and diplomatic missions abroad, all present the\r\nsame spectacle;--an immense majority of power in the hands of a very\r\nsmall minority of the people--millions made for a fraction of a few\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFrom that day (1830,) SLAVERY, SLAVEHOLDING, SLAVE-BREEDING AND\r\nSLAVE-TRADING, HAVE FORMED THE WHOLE FOUNDATION OF THE POLICY OF THE\r\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT, and of the slaveholding States, at home and\r\nabroad; and at the very time when a new census has exhibited a large\r\nincrease upon the superior numbers of the free States, it has\r\npresented the portentous evidence of increased influence and\r\nascendancy of the slave-holding power.\r\n\r\nOf the prevalence of that power, you have had continual and conclusive\r\nevidence in the suppression for the space of ten years of the right of\r\npetition, guarantied, if there could be a guarantee against slavery,\r\nby the first article amendatory of the Constitution.",
