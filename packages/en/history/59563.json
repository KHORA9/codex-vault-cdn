R. HAMERSLY & CO.\r\n  1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1880, by\r\n  THOMAS WILHELM, U.S.A.,\r\n  In the office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO\r\n  BREVET MAJOR-GENERAL AUGUST V. KAUTZ,\r\n  COLONEL EIGHTH REGIMENT OF INFANTRY, U.S.A.,\r\n\r\n  BY WHOSE SUGGESTIONS, ENCOURAGEMENT, AND AID THE WORK WAS UNDERTAKEN,\r\n  PERSEVERED IN, AND COMPLETED,\r\n\r\n  THIS COMPILATION\r\n  IS, WITH RESPECT AND GRATITUDE, DEDICATED\r\n  BY HIS OBEDIENT SERVANT,\r\n  THE COMPILER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with no small degree of relief that the compiler of this work now\r\nturns from a self-imposed task, involving some years of the closest\r\napplication, to write a brief preface, not as a necessity, but in\r\njustice to the work and the numerous friends who have taken the warmest\r\ninterest in its progress and final completion.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable that in the vast amount of patient and persistent labor\r\nin a work of this kind, extending to 1386 pages, and containing 17,257\r\ndistinct articles, there should be a few errors, oversights, and\r\ninconsistencies, notwithstanding all the vigilance to the contrary.\r\n\r\nCondensation has been accomplished where it was possible to do so, and\r\nrepetition avoided to a great extent by reference, where further\r\ninformation was contained in other articles of this book.\r\n\r\nThe contributions to the Regimental Library, which afforded the\r\nopportunity for this compilation, of standard foreign works, were of\r\ninfinite value, and many thanks are tendered for them.\r\n\r\nTo G. & C. MERRIAM, Publishers, for the use of Webster’s Unabridged\r\nDictionary; J. B. LIPPINCOTT & CO., Publishers, Philadelphia; D. VAN\r\nNOSTRAND, Publisher, New York; Maj. WILLIAM A. MARYE, Ordnance\r\nDepartment, U.S.A.; Maj. W. S. WORTH, Eighth Infantry, U.S.A.; Maj. D.\r\nT. WELLS, Eighth Infantry, U.S.A.; Lieut. F. A. WHITNEY, Adjutant Eighth\r\nInfantry, U.S.A.; Lieut. C. A. L. TOTTEN, Fourth Artillery, U.S.A.;\r\nLieut. C. M. BAILY, Quartermaster Eighth Infantry, U.S.A.; and Lieut. G.\r\nP. SCRIVEN, Third Artillery, U.S.A., the compiler is indebted for\r\ncourteous assistance in the preparation of this volume.\r\n\r\n  OCTOBER, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn submitting this volume to the public it is deemed proper to say that\r\nthe design of the work is to bring together into one series, and in as\r\ncompact a form as possible for ready reference, such information as the\r\nstudent of the science and art of war, persons interested in the local\r\nor reserve forces, libraries, as well as the editors of the daily press,\r\nshould possess. In short, it is believed that the work will be useful to\r\nindividuals of all ranks and conditions.\r\n\r\nThe compiler has labored under some disadvantages in obtaining the\r\nnecessary information for this volume, and much is due to the\r\nencouragement and assistance received from accomplished and eminent\r\nofficers, through which he was enabled to undertake the revision of the\r\nfirst issue of this work with greater assurance; and among the officers\r\nreferred to, Lieut. WILLIAM R. QUINAN, of the Fourth Artillery, U.S.A.,\r\ndeserves especially to be mentioned. It may not be out of place here to\r\nstate that the compiler takes no credit to himself beyond the labor\r\ncontributed in the several years of research, and bringing forward to\r\ndate the matter requiring it, with such changes as the advance of time\r\nand improvements demand.\r\n\r\nAs it was thought best to make this work purely military, all naval\r\nreferences which appeared in the first edition have been eliminated.\r\n\r\n  MAY, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CONSULTED IN THE COMPILATION OF THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH AND AMERICAN WORKS.\r\n\r\n  A HANDY DICTIONARY OF MILITARY TERMS--Knollys.\r\n\r\n  AIDE MEMOIRE TO THE MILITARY SCIENCES--Originally edited by a\r\n  Committee of the Royal Engineers in England (Revised and Enlarged).\r\n\r\n  ANALYTICAL DIGEST OF THE MILITARY LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES--Scott.\r\n\r\n  A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF EVIDENCE--Greenleaf.\r\n\r\n  BEETON’S DICTIONARY OF UNIVERSAL BIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n  BEETON’S DICTIONARY OF UNIVERSAL GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n  CHAMBERS’S ENCYCLOPÆDIA.\r\n\r\n  CUSTOMS OF SERVICE FOR NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE\r\n  ARMY--Kautz.\r\n\r\n  CUSTOMS OF SERVICE FOR OFFICERS OF THE ARMY--Kautz.\r\n\r\n  CLASSICAL DICTIONARY--Smith.\r\n\r\n  DIGEST OF OPINIONS OF THE JUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL--Winthrop.\r\n\r\n  DICTIONARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY--Gardner.\r\n\r\n  DICTIONARY OF GREEK AND ROMAN ANTIQUITIES--Smith.\r\n\r\n  DICTIONARY OF GREEK AND ROMAN BIOGRAPHY AND MYTHOLOGY--Smith.\r\n\r\n  DICTIONARY OF GREEK AND ROMAN GEOGRAPHY--Smith.\r\n\r\n  DICTIONARY OF ARTS, MANUFACTURES, AND MINES--Ure.\r\n\r\n  DICTIONARY OF EVERY DAYS DIFFICULTIES--Shilton.\r\n\r\n  DICTIONARY OF SCIENCE, LITERATURE, AND ART--Brande.\r\n\r\n  ELEMENTS OF THE ART AND SCIENCE OF WAR--Wheeler.\r\n\r\n  ELEMENTS OF MILITARY ARTS AND SCIENCES--Halleck.\r\n\r\n  ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA.\r\n\r\n  FRENCH AND ENGLISH PRONOUNCING DICTIONARY--Spiers and Surenne.\r\n\r\n  FIELD EXERCISE (English), 1870.\r\n\r\n  FIELD-BOOK OF THE REVOLUTION--Lossing.\r\n\r\n  HAND-BOOK OF ARTILLERY--Roberts.\r\n\r\n  HAYDN’S DICTIONARY OF DATES--Payne.\r\n\r\n  HAYDN’S DICTIONARY OF SCIENCE--Payne.\r\n\r\n  HAYDN’S DICTIONARY OF THE BIBLE--Payne.\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES--Bancroft.\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE WAR IN THE PENINSULA AND IN THE SOUTH OF\r\n  FRANCE--Napier.\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF ENGLAND--Knight.\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF THE REBELLION--Tenney.\r\n\r\n  INFANTRY, CAVALRY, AND ARTILLERY TACTICS, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n  INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIELD ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n  JOMINI’S ART OF WAR--Translated from the French by Captains Mendell\r\n  and Craighill, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n  JOMINI’S TREATISE ON GRAND MILITARY OPERATIONS, OR A CRITICAL AND\r\n  MILITARY HISTORY OF THE WARS OF FREDERICK THE GREAT--Translated by\r\n  Colonel S.

Should any one from ignorance not perceive the\r\nimmense advantages that arise from a good discipline, it will be\r\nsufficient to observe the alterations that have happened in Europe since\r\nthe year 1700.--_Saxe._\r\n\r\nIf the first duty of a state is its own security, the second is the\r\nsecurity of neighboring states whose existence is necessary for its own\r\npreservation.--_Jomini’s “Life of Napoleon.”_\r\n\r\nA good general, a well-organized system, good instruction, and severe\r\ndiscipline, aided by effective establishments, will always make good\r\ntroops, independently of the cause for which they fight. At the same\r\ntime, a love of country, a spirit of enthusiasm, a sense of national\r\nhonor, will operate upon young soldiers with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe officer who obeys, whatever may be the nature or extent of his\r\ncommand, will always stand excused executing implicitly the orders which\r\nhave been given to him.\r\n\r\nEvery means should be taken to attach the soldier to his colors. This is\r\nbest accomplished by showing consideration and respect to the old\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nThe first qualification of a soldier is fortitude under fatigue and\r\nprivation. Courage is only the second; hardship, poverty, and want are\r\nthe best schools for a soldier.\r\n\r\nTroops, whether halted, or encamped, or on the march, should be always\r\nin favorable position, possessing the essentials required for a field of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nSome men are so physically and morally constituted as to see everything\r\nthrough a highly-colored medium. They raise up a picture in the mind on\r\nevery slight occasion, and give to every trivial occurrence a dramatic\r\ninterest. But whatever knowledge, or talent, or courage, or other\r\ngood qualities such men may possess, nature has not formed them\r\nfor the command of armies or the direction of great military\r\noperations.--_Napoleon’s “Maxims of War.”_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY DICTIONARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aachen.= See AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.\r\n\r\n=Aar.= A river in Switzerland, flows into the Rhine opposite and near\r\nWaldshut, in Aargau. Prince Charles, while crossing the river, August\r\n17, 1799, was repulsed by the French generals Ney and Heudelet.\r\n\r\n=Aarau.= A city in Switzerland. Peace was here declared, July 18, 1712,\r\nending the war between the cantons Zurich and Berne on one side, and\r\nLuzerne, Uri, Schuyz, Unterwalden, and Zug on the other.\r\n\r\n=Abad= (_Abadides_). A line of Moorish kings who reigned in Seville from\r\n1026 to 1090.\r\n\r\n=Abaisse.= In heraldry, when the fesse or any other armorial figure is\r\ndepressed, or situated below the centre of the shield, it is said to be\r\n_abaisse_ (“lowered”).\r\n\r\n=Abandon.= In a military sense, used in the relinquishment of a military\r\npost, district, or station, or the breaking up of a military\r\nestablishment. To abandon any fort, post, guard, arms, ammunition, or\r\ncolors without good cause is punishable.\r\n\r\n=Abase, To.= An old word signifying to lower a flag. _Abaisser_ is in\r\nuse in the French marine, and both may be derived from the still older\r\n_abeigh_, to cast down, to humble.\r\n\r\n=Abatement.= In heraldry, is a mark placed over a portion of the\r\npaternal coat of arms, indicating some base or ungentlemanly act on the\r\npart of the bearer.\r\n\r\n=Abatis=, or =Abattis=. A means of defense formed by cutting off the\r\nsmaller branches of trees felled in the direction from which the enemy\r\nmay be expected. The ends of the larger branches are sharpened and the\r\nbutts of the limbs or trees fastened by crochet picket, or by imbedding\r\nin the earth, so that they cannot be easily removed. Abatis is generally\r\nused in parts of a ditch or intrenchment to delay the enemy under fire.\r\n\r\n=Abblast.= See ARBALEST.\r\n\r\n=Abblaster.= See ARBALIST.\r\n\r\n=Abdivtes.= A piratical people descended from the Saracens, who lived\r\nsouth of Mount Ida (Psilorati), in the island of Crete (Candia), where\r\nthey established themselves in 825.\r\n\r\n=Abduction= (_Fr._). Diminution; diminishing the front of a line or\r\ncolumn by breaking off a division, subdivision, or files, in order to\r\navoid some obstacle.\r\n\r\n=Abencerrages.= A Moorish tribe which occupied the kingdom of Granada.\r\nGranada was disturbed by incessant quarrels between this tribe and the\r\nZegris from 1480 to 1492.

The guard consisted of 40 mounted\r\nand 160 dismounted men.\r\n\r\n=Abo.= A Russian city and seaport, on the Aurajoki near its entrance\r\ninto the Gulf of Bothnia. It formerly belonged to Sweden, but was taken\r\nwith the whole of Finland by the Russians in the war begun by Sweden in\r\n1741. By a treaty of peace concluded hero in 1743 the conquered\r\npossessions were restored to Sweden. They were ceded to Russia in 1809.\r\n\r\n=Abolla.= A warm kind of military garment, lined or doubled, worn by\r\nboth Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\n=Abou-girgeh.= A city of Upper Egypt where the French defeated the\r\nEgyptians in 1799.\r\n\r\n=Aboukir= (anc. _Canopus_). A village of Egypt on a promontory at the\r\nwestern extremity of the bay of the same name, 15 miles northeast of\r\nAlexandria. In the bay Nelson defeated the French fleet, August 1, 1798.\r\nThis engagement, which resulted in a loss to the French of 11\r\nline-of-battle ships, is known as the “battle of the Nile.” In 1801 a\r\nBritish expedition under Sir Ralph Abercromby landed at Aboukir, and\r\ncaptured the place after an obstinate and sanguinary conflict with the\r\nFrench (March 8). Here also a Turkish army of 15,000 men was defeated by\r\n5000 French under Bonaparte, July 25, 1799.\r\n\r\n=Aboumand.= Village of Upper Egypt, near the river Nile, where the\r\nFrench fought the Arabs in 1799.\r\n\r\n=About.= A technical word to express the movement by which a body of\r\ntroops or artillery carriages change front.\r\n\r\n=Abraham, Heights of.= Near Quebec, Lower Canada. In the memorable\r\nengagement which took place here September 13, 1759, the French under\r\nGen. Montcalm were defeated by the English under Gen. Wolfe, who was\r\nkilled in the moment of victory.\r\n\r\n=Abri= (_Fr._). Shelter, cover, concealment; arm-sheds in a camp secure\r\nfrom rain, dust, etc.; place of security from the effect of shot,\r\nshells, or attack.\r\n\r\n=Absence, Leave of.= The permission which officers of the army obtain to\r\nabsent themselves from duty. In the U. S. service an officer is entitled\r\nto 30 days’ leave in each year on full pay. This time he may permit to\r\naccumulate for a period not exceeding 4 years. An officer, however, may\r\nenjoy 5 months’ continuous leave on full pay, provided the fifth month\r\nof such leave is wholly distinct from the four-year period within and\r\nfor which the 4 months’ absence with full pay was enjoyed. An officer on\r\nleave over this time is entitled to half-pay only.\r\n\r\n=Absent.= A term used in military returns in accounting for the\r\ndeficiency of any given number of officers or soldiers, and is usually\r\ndistinguished under two heads, viz.: _Absent with leave_, such as\r\nofficers with permission, or enlisted men on furlough. _Absent without\r\nleave_; men who desert are sometimes reported _absent without leave_, to\r\nbring their crimes under cognizance of regimental, garrison, or\r\nfield-officers’ courts; thus, under mitigating circumstances, trial by\r\ngeneral court-martial is avoided. Absence without leave entails\r\nforfeiture of pay during such absence, unless it is excused as\r\nunavoidable. An officer absent without leave for three months may be\r\ndropped from the rolls of the army by the President, and is not eligible\r\nto reappointment.\r\n\r\n=Absolute Force of Gunpowder.= Is measured by the pressure it exerts on\r\nits environment when it exactly fills the space in which it is fired.\r\nVarious attempts have been made to determine this force experimentally\r\nwith widely different results. Robins estimated the pressure on the\r\nsquare inch at 1000 atmospheres, Hutton at 1800, and Count Rumford as\r\nhigh as 100,000 atmospheres. While Rodman, by experiments upon strong\r\ncast-iron shells, verified the accuracy of Rumford’s _formulas_, he\r\nfound that his estimate of the force was greatly in error. According to\r\nRodman the pressure is approximately 14,000 atmospheres. Dr. Woodbridge,\r\nanother American philosopher and inventor, has shown that, fired in\r\nsmall quantities, the force of gunpowder does not exceed 6200\r\natmospheres. This agrees closely with the conclusion arrived at by the\r\nEnglish “Committee on Explosives,” 1875, who found that even in large\r\nguns the force did not exceed 42 tons.\r\n\r\n=Absorokas.= A tribe of North American Indians. See CROWS.\r\n\r\n=Absterdam Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Abydus.= An ancient city of Mysia on the Hellespont nearly opposite\r\nSestus on the European shore. Near this town Xerxes placed the bridge of\r\nboats by which his troops were conveyed across the channel to the town\r\nof Sestus, 480 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Abyssinia.= A country of Eastern Africa, forming an elevated table-land\r\nand containing many fertile valleys. Theodore II., the king of this\r\ncountry, having maltreated and imprisoned some English subjects, an\r\nexpedition under Lord Napier was sent against him from Bombay in 1867.\r\nOn April 14, 1868, the mountain fortress of Magdala was stormed and\r\ntaken with but little trouble, and Theodore was found dead on the hill,\r\nhaving killed himself. The country is at present governed by Emperor\r\nJohn of Ethiopia, who was crowned in 1872.\r\n\r\n=Academies, Military.= See MILITARY ACADEMIES.\r\n\r\n=Accelerator.= A cannon in which several charges are successively fired\r\nto give an increasing velocity to the projectile while moving in the\r\nbore. See MULTI-CHARGE GUN.\r\n\r\n=Accessible.= Easy of access or approach. A place or fort is said to be\r\naccessible when it can be approached with a hostile force by land or\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n=Accintus.= A word in ancient times signifying the complete\r\naccoutrements of a soldier.\r\n\r\n=Accolade.= The ceremonious act of conferring knighthood in ancient\r\ntimes.

Specifically, the\r\nequipments of a soldier, except arms and clothing.\r\n\r\n=Accused.= In a military sense, the designation of one who is arraigned\r\nbefore a military court.\r\n\r\n=Acerræ= (now _Acera_). A city in the kingdom of Naples, taken and\r\nburned by Hannibal in 216 B.C. In 90 B.C. the Romans defeated under its\r\nwalls the allied rebels commanded by Papius.\r\n\r\n=Acerræ.= A city of the Gauls, taken by Marcellus in 222 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Achæan League.= A confederacy which existed from very early times among\r\nthe twelve states of the province of Achaia, in the north of the\r\nPeloponnesus. It was broken up after the death of Alexander the Great,\r\nbut was set on foot again by some of the original cities, 280 B.C., the\r\nepoch of its rise into great historical importance; for from this time\r\nit gained strength, and finally spread over the whole Peloponnesus,\r\nthough not without much opposition, principally on the part of\r\nLacedæmon. It was finally dissolved by the Romans, on the event of the\r\ncapture of Corinth by Mummius, 147 B.C.

After his victory at\r\nBull Run, August 30, Lee invaded Maryland, and was immediately followed\r\nby McClellan. On September 16, Lee was joined by Jackson. The battle on\r\nwhich was staked “the invasion of Maryland,” in the view of the Federal\r\ngovernment, but in reality the sovereignty of the Union, was near at\r\nhand.

Gen. Mansfield was killed and Gen. Hooker wounded at\r\nthis crisis, and obliged to withdraw from the field. Gen. Sumner’s corps\r\nsoon reached this portion of the field and became hotly engaged. This\r\ncorps suffered greatly at this period of the contest, Gens. Sedgwick and\r\nCrawford being wounded, and portions of the line were compelled to fall\r\nback. The enemy, however, were checked by the Federal artillery.\r\nSumner’s corps was soon reinforced, and the lost ground was recovered.\r\nThe contest in the mean time on the right was most obstinate, and the\r\nlosses in this part of the field were very heavy. Gen. Burnside’s corps,\r\non the left, was ordered early in the day to carry the bridge across the\r\nAntietam and to attack the enemy’s right. The approaches to the bridge\r\nbeing in the nature of a defile, and being swept by batteries of the\r\nenemy, the opposite bank of the Antietam was only reached after a severe\r\nstruggle. It was afternoon before the heights were in his possession.\r\nThe enemy were driven back, and a portion of their line in disorder. By\r\nthe most desperate efforts, however, the enemy rallied their retreating\r\nregiments, strengthened their lines with all their available fresh\r\ntroops, and opened batteries on the hills.\r\n\r\nGen. Burnside could not maintain his advantage, and was obliged to\r\nwithdraw from the extreme position which he had gained to one slightly\r\nin rear. He, however, held his bank of the river completely, and\r\nmaintained much ground beyond it which he had taken from the enemy.\r\nDuring the advance on the left Gen. Rodman was wounded.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding substantial and decided successes of the day, the\r\nFederal forces had suffered so severely during the conflict, having lost\r\n11,426 killed and wounded, and among them many general and superior\r\nofficers, that it was deemed prudent by Gen. McClellan to reorganize and\r\ngive rest and refreshment to the troops before renewing the attack. The\r\n18th was accordingly devoted to those objects. On the night of the 18th,\r\nhowever, Gen. Lee withdrew his forces hastily across the Potomac,\r\nabandoning further contest with the Union forces, and yielding all hopes\r\nof further remaining on Maryland soil. The Confederate army is supposed\r\nto have lost nearly 30,000 men during its brief campaign in Maryland.\r\nThe Federal forces captured 39 colors, 13 guns, more than 15,000\r\nsmall-arms, and more than 6000 prisoners.--_Extracts from D.

But the\r\nCongress may, by law, vest the appointment of such inferior officers as\r\nthey think proper in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in\r\nthe heads of departments.” If due regard, however, be paid to the words\r\n“_whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for_,” the\r\npretension set up in favor of executive power will receive no support\r\nfrom the terms of the Constitution. The powers granted to Congress to\r\n_raise_ and support armies, and to make all _rules_ for the _government_\r\nand _regulation_ of the land and naval forces, are necessarily so\r\ncomprehensive in character, as to embrace all means which Congress,\r\naccording to circumstances, may deem proper and necessary in order to\r\nraise armies, or govern them when raised. Rules of appointment to\r\noffice, rules of promotion,--another form of appointment,--and all rules\r\nwhatever in relation to the land and naval forces, save the appointment\r\nof the commander-in-chief of those united forces, who is designated by\r\nthe Constitution, are hence within the competency of Congress.\r\n\r\n=Appointment.= Office, rank, or employment.\r\n\r\n=Appointment.= The equipment, ordnance, furniture, and necessaries of an\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n=Appointments, Military.= The accoutrements of an officer.\r\n\r\n=Appointon= (_Fr._).

The terms truce (see TRUCE) and armistice are\r\nsometimes used in the same sense.\r\n\r\n=Armless.= Without arms or armor.\r\n\r\n=Armlet.= The name of a piece of armor for the arm, to protect it from\r\nthe jar of the bow-string.\r\n\r\n=Armor.= Defensive arms for the body; any clothing or covering worn to\r\nprotect one’s person in battle. In English statutes, armor is used for\r\nthe whole apparatus of war, including offensive as well as defensive\r\narms. The _statutes of armor_ directed what arms every man should\r\nprovide. Armor has also been extensively used in England in plating\r\nimportant fortifications as those of Portsmouth, and also in Germany for\r\nthe forts along the frontier.\r\n\r\n=Armor-bearer.= One who carries the armor of another; an armiger; an\r\nesquire.\r\n\r\n=Armorer.= The person who makes, cleans, or repairs arms.\r\n\r\n=Armorial.= Belonging to armor, or to the arms or escutcheon of a\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n=Armor Plates.= From experiments of the effects of shot and shell on\r\narmor plates in England, the following results have been obtained: Where\r\nit is required to perforate the plate, the projectile should be of hard\r\nmaterial, such as steel, or chilled iron, and the form best suited for\r\nthis purpose is the pointed ogeeval. The resistance of wrought-iron\r\nplates to perforation by steel projectiles varies as the squares of\r\ntheir thickness. Hitting a plate at an angle diminishes the effect as\r\nregards the power of perforation in the proportion of the sine of the\r\nangle of incidence to unity. The resistance of wrought-iron plates to\r\nperforation by steel shot is practically not much, if at all, increased\r\nby backing simply of wood, within the usual limits of thickness; it is,\r\nhowever, much increased by a rigid backing either of iron combined with\r\nwood, or of granite, iron, brick, etc.\r\n\r\nTill quite recently armor plates have been made of wrought iron only, as\r\nnumerous experiments in England had served to show that notwithstanding\r\nthe enormous resistance of steel to penetration it was unfit for armor\r\nplating,--the damage from the impact of shot not being localized as in\r\nwrought iron. The Italians were led, however, by the experiments with\r\nthe 100-ton gun on targets of both metals at Spezzia, 1876, to adopt\r\nsteel for their new ships, the “Duilio” and “Dandolo.” Since that time\r\nan armor compounded of steel and wrought iron has been introduced in\r\nEngland which bids fair to supersede all others. It is made by casting a\r\nheavy facing of steel upon wrought-iron plates. A section of this\r\ncompound armor exhibits a gradual change of structure from the hard\r\nsteel face to the soft iron backing. Its resistance to penetration is\r\nequal to steel, while in toughness and endurance under the blows of\r\nshot it resembles wrought iron.\r\n\r\nTo glance at some of the heaviest armor plating afloat, the English\r\n“Inflexible” carries a maximum thickness of 24 inches of iron, the\r\nItalian frigates mentioned above 21.5 of steel, the French “Admiral\r\nDuperré” 21.6 of iron, the Russian “Peter the Great” 14 inches of iron.\r\nIn regard to the power of some of the most noted of modern guns, the\r\n12-inch calibres used now by all leading nations will penetrate, at 1000\r\nyards, 16 to 18 inches of iron. The 38-ton English gun of this calibre\r\nhas penetrated (at shorter range) 22 inches of iron and 6 inches of teak\r\nbacking. The 80-ton Woolwich gun will penetrate 23 inches of iron at\r\n1000 yards. The largest Krupp, 72 tons, will penetrate 26 inches, and\r\nthe 100-ton Armstrong 30 inches at the same distance. None of the guns\r\nmentioned would penetrate at a single shot the steel armor of the\r\nItalian ships, but any of them would destroy it in a number of rounds.\r\n\r\n=Armory.= A manufactory, or place of deposit for arms. See ARSENAL.\r\n\r\n=Armory, National.= The U. S. government establishment for the\r\nmanufacture of small-arms at Springfield, Mass.\r\n\r\n=Arm-rack.= A frame or fitting for the stowage of arms (usually\r\nvertical) out of harm’s way, but in readiness for immediate use. In the\r\nconveyance of troops by sea arm-racks form a part of the proper\r\naccommodation. Arm-racks are also used in soldiers’ barrack-rooms.\r\n\r\n=Arms.= In a general sense, comprehend weapons both of an offensive and\r\ndefensive character, but in the usual restricted sense they only embrace\r\nthe former, and in modern warfare include the gun and bayonet, the\r\nrifle, the pistol, the carbine, the sword, the lance, cannon, etc., all\r\nof which are noticed under their respective heads. For punishment\r\ninflicted upon soldiers who sell or otherwise dispose of their arms, see\r\nAPPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 17.\r\n\r\n=Arms.= This term is used in heraldry to designate the devices borne on\r\nshields, and includes all the accompaniments, such as the crest, helmet,\r\nsupporters, etc.\r\n\r\n=Arms, Bells of.= Are tents, used in the English service, mostly of a\r\nconical shape, for containing the small-arms for each company in a\r\nregiment of infantry. The tent is frequently painted with the color of\r\nthe facings of the regimental uniforms.\r\n\r\n=Arms, Stand of.= A complete set for one soldier, as a rifle and\r\nbayonet, cartridge-box and belt, frequently the rifle and bayonet alone.\r\n\r\n=Armstrong Gun.= The Armstrong gun as a breech-loading field-piece first\r\nattracted attention in England about 1850. About 1858 it was adopted by\r\nthe British government. This gun was made of wrought iron, and consisted\r\nof a single coiled tube reinforced at the breech with two thin tubes,\r\nthe outer one being a coiled tube, the inner being formed by bending a\r\nplate and welding the edges. The coiled tubes were formed by bending\r\nsquare bars of iron around a mandrel and welding the coils together.\r\nTubes made in this way offer great resistance to tangential strains. The\r\nintermediate tube was designed to take up the longitudinal strain near\r\nthe breech, and for this reason was made differently. The breech was\r\nclosed with a vent-piece, slipped by the band into a slot cut in the\r\npiece near the breech, and held in its place by a breech-screw, which\r\nsupported it from behind. This screw was made in the form of a tube, so\r\nthat its hollow formed a part of the bore prolonged, when the vent-piece\r\nwas drawn. Through the hollow screw the charge was passed into the\r\nchamber. The vent was formed in the breech-piece. This gun was a 3-inch\r\n12-pounder, firing a lead-coated projectile. It was followed by the\r\n40-pounder, 110-pounder, and other calibres. Muzzle-loaders were also\r\nmade. The breech-loading apparatus did not prove entirely successful in\r\nlarge guns, and was accordingly discarded except for small calibres. The\r\nmethod of construction was changed for larger guns, and a plan adopted\r\nwhich has been adhered to ever since, and is that now used. The barrel\r\nor part surrounding the bore is made of steel tempered in oil; that\r\nportion at and in rear of the trunnions is enveloped by several layers\r\nof wrought-iron tubes, the number of layers depending upon the size of\r\nthe gun. These tubes, instead of being joined at their ends by welding,\r\nare hooked on to each other by a system of shoulders and recesses. There\r\nare also projections fitting into corresponding recesses, which serve to\r\nprevent the tubes from slipping within each other. The tube which\r\nimmediately surrounds the barrel opposite to the seat of the charge is\r\ncalled the breech-piece. It is made with its fibres and welds running\r\nlongitudinally, so as to resist the recoil of the barrel against the\r\nhead of the breech-plug, which is screwed into the breech-piece. The\r\nshunt system of rifling was first applied to muzzle-loading Armstrong\r\nguns, which have fewer grooves than the breech-loaders. The method of\r\nmanufacturing originally proposed by Sir William Armstrong has been\r\ngreatly modified by Mr. Fraser, of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. (See\r\nORDNANCE, ARMSTRONG CANNON). For some years large numbers of Armstrong\r\nguns were made at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, under the supervision of\r\nthe inventor. His works are now located at Elswick, Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\r\nand are known us the Elswick Ordnance Works. To distinguish the system\r\nof gun-construction from the “Woolwich,” which it closely resembles, it\r\nis frequently called the “Elswick” system. The largest, as well as the\r\nmost powerful guns ever made, are the 100-ton guns manufactured at\r\nElswick for the Italian navy. See CANNON AND ORDNANCE, MODERN HISTORY\r\nOF.\r\n\r\n=Armstrong Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Army.= A large and organized body of soldiers, consisting of infantry,\r\ncavalry, and artillery, completely armed, and provided with the\r\nnecessary stores, etc., the whole being composed of companies,\r\nbattalions, regiments, brigades, divisions, and corps, under proper\r\nofficers, and the entire force being under the direction of one general,\r\nwho is called the general-in-chief, and sometimes the _generalissimo_.\r\nArmies are distinguished by different appellations; as, a _covering\r\narmy_, a _blockading army_, an _army of obstruction_, an _army of\r\nreserve_, a _flying army_, etc. An army is said to _cover_ a place when\r\nit is encamped or in cantonments for the protection of the different\r\npasses which lead to a principal object of defense. An army is said to\r\n_blockade_ a place when, being well provided with heavy ordnance and\r\nother warlike means, it is employed to invest a town for the direct and\r\nimmediate purpose of reducing it by assault or famine. An _army of\r\nobstruction_ is so called because by its advanced positions and\r\ndesultory movements it is constantly employed in watching the enemy. _A\r\nflying army_ means a strong body of horse and foot, which is always in\r\nmotion, both to cover its own garrisons and keep the enemy in continual\r\nalarm. For method of providing for armies, see APPROPRIATIONS.\r\n\r\n=Army Corps.= See CORPS D’ARMÉE.\r\n\r\n=Army Regulations.= This is the name of a work published by the War\r\nDepartment embodying all the acts of Congress, and the rules laid down\r\nby the President for the management of the army, both in peace and war.\r\nSee REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n=Arnaouts=, or =Arnouts, Corps des=.

(See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 65.) Private soldiers are usually\r\nplaced under guard; by the custom of the service non-commissioned\r\nofficers may be simply placed in arrest in quarters.\r\n\r\n=Arrest= (_Old Fr._, now _arret_). A French phrase, similar in its\r\nimport to the Latin word _retinaculum_; it consisted of a small piece of\r\nsteel or iron, which was formerly used in the construction of fire-arms,\r\nto prevent the piece from going off. A familiar phrase among military\r\nmen in France is, _Ce pistolet est en arret_, “this pistol is in arrest\r\nor is stopped.”\r\n\r\n=Arreste of the Glacis.= Is the junction of the talus which is formed at\r\nall the angles.\r\n\r\n=Arretium.= A city of the Gauls, now in the department of the Yonne,\r\nFrance, where the Gauls defeated the Romans in a bloody battle in 284\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\n=Arrow.= In fortification, a work placed at the salient angles of the\r\nglacis, communicating with the covert way.\r\n\r\n=Arrow.= A missile weapon of defense, straight, slender, pointed, and\r\nbarbed, to be shot with a bow.\r\n\r\n=Arrow-head.= The head of an arrow.\r\n\r\n=Arrow-wood.= A species of _Viburnum_, from the long straight stems of\r\nwhich the Indians dwelling between the Mississippi and the Pacific make\r\ntheir arrows.\r\n\r\n=Arrowy.= Consisting of arrows.\r\n\r\n=Arroyo del Molinos.= A small town in Estremadura, Spain, near the river\r\nGuadiana, where Lord Hill, on the 28th of October, 1811, surprised and\r\ndefeated the French under Gen.

Brun, one colonel, two\r\nlieutenant-colonels, a commissaire de guerre, and no less than 30\r\ncaptains and inferior officers. It was altogether a most brilliant\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n=Arsenal.= A public establishment for the storage or for the manufacture\r\nand storage of arms and all military equipments, whether for land or\r\nnaval service. In the United States there are 17 arsenals and 1 armory\r\n(Springfield, Mass.), situated at different points throughout the whole\r\ncountry convenient for the distribution of _materiel_, as follows:\r\nAlleghany arsenal, at Pittsburg, Pa.; at Augusta, Ga.; Benicia, Cal.;\r\nFort Monroe, Va.; Fort Union, N.

Ascalon surrendered, and\r\nRichard marched to Jerusalem, 1192.\r\n\r\n=Art, Military.= Military art may be divided into two principal\r\nbranches. The first branch relates to the order and arrangement which\r\nmust be observed in the management of an army, when it is to engage an\r\nenemy, to march, or to be encamped. This branch is called _tactics_. The\r\nsame appellation belongs to the other branch of military art, which also\r\nincludes the composition and application of warlike machines. See\r\nLOGISTICS, STRATEGY, STRATAGEM, TACTICS, and WAR.\r\n\r\n=Arta=, or =Narda=. A town in Albania. The Greek insurgents against the\r\nPorte were defeated here, July 16, 1822.\r\n\r\n=Artaxata.= The ancient capital of Armenia; burned by the Roman general\r\nCarbulo, about 59.\r\n\r\n=Artemisium.= A promontory in Eubœa, near which indecisive conflicts\r\ntook place between the Greek and Persian fleets for three days, 480 B.C.\r\nThe former retired on hearing of the battle of Thermopylæ.\r\n\r\n=Articles of War.= Are known rules and regulations, fixed by law, for\r\nthe better government of an army. The articles of war of the United\r\nStates consists of 128 articles. (See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR.) All\r\nthat relates to the army not comprehended therein is published in\r\ngeneral orders or in established regulations, issued from time to time\r\nfrom the War Department, copies of which are furnished and read to the\r\ntroops. In England they may be altered and enlarged at the pleasure of\r\nthe sovereign, but must be annually confirmed by Parliament under the\r\nMutiny Act.\r\n\r\n=Artifice.= Among the French, is understood as comprehending everything\r\nwhich enters the composition of fire-works, as the sulphur, saltpetre,\r\ncharcoal, etc. See PYROTECHNICS.\r\n\r\n=Artificer.= One who makes fire works, or works in the artillery\r\nlaboratory, and prepares the shells, fuzes, grenades, etc. It is also\r\napplied to military mechanics, such as carpenters, blacksmiths, masons,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Artificial Line of Sight.= Is the right line from the eye to the object\r\nto be hit, passing through the front and rear sights. See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Artillery.= In a general sense, signifies all sorts of great guns or\r\ncannon, mortars, howitzers, petards, and the like, together with all the\r\napparatus and stores thereto belonging, which are not only taken into\r\nthe field, but likewise to sieges, and made use of both to attack and\r\ndefend fortified places; also the officers and men of that branch of the\r\narmy to which the care and management of such machines have been\r\nconfided. (See ORDNANCE.) Artillery, in a particular sense, signifies\r\nthe science of artillery or gunnery, which art includes a knowledge of\r\nsurveying, leveling, geometry, trigonometry, conic sections, laws of\r\nmotion, mechanics, fortifications, and projectiles. See BATTERY, FIELD\r\nBATTERY, FIELD ARTILLERY, SIEGE ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n=Artillery Company, Honorable.= A band of infantry, rifles, and\r\nartillery, forming part of the militia, or city guards of London,\r\nEngland. It was instituted in 1585; having ceased, was revived in 1610.\r\nIn the civil war, 1641-48, the company took the side of the Parliament,\r\nand greatly contributed towards its success. The company numbered 1200\r\nin 1803, and 800 in 1861. Since 1842 the officers have been appointed by\r\nthe queen. On the decease of the Duke of Sussex, in 1843, the prince\r\nconsort became colonel and captain-general. He died December 14, 1861,\r\nand the Prince of Wales was appointed his successor, August 24, 1863.\r\n\r\n=Artilleryman.= A man who manages, or assists in managing, large guns in\r\nfiring.\r\n\r\n=Artillery-park.= The camp of one or more field batteries; the inclosure\r\nwhere, during a siege, the general camp of foot artillery, and depots of\r\nguns, _materiel_, etc., are collected.\r\n\r\n=Artillery, Royal Regiment of.= Is the collective name for the whole of\r\nthe artillery belonging to the British army. There was no regular\r\nregiment or corps of artillery soldiers in the British army till the\r\ntime of Queen Anne, when the present royal regiment was formed. Since\r\nthat period, from some anomaly which is not easily explained, all the\r\nadditions have been made to the same regiment, instead of forming new\r\nregiments, to be combined into a division or corps. The regiment is now\r\nalmost an entire army in itself, and to increase the anomaly, it\r\ncomprises horse as well as foot. Formerly the foot was divided into\r\nbattalions and companies, and the horse into troops, but these terms\r\nhave been abolished, in favor of brigade and battery, which apply both\r\nto horse and foot artillery. The regiment now consists of 33,500 men,\r\nthus distributed:\r\n\r\n   6 brigades, horse artillery,  30 batteries.\r\n   8    „      field artillery,  62    „\r\n  14    „      garrison art.,   103    „\r\n   3    „      mixed artillery,  19    „\r\n                                ---\r\n                                214\r\n\r\n   1    „      coast artillery not in batteries.\r\n   1    „      depot artillery      „    „\r\n\r\nOf the above, the field, garrison, and mixed are foot artillery. This\r\nforce represents from 1200 to 1300 guns fully equipped for action. Of\r\nthe foot artillery, the garrison batteries are readily converted to\r\nfield batteries by the addition of a few drivers.\r\n\r\n=Artillery Schools.= Are special schools for instruction and training in\r\nartillery, which are organized through all civilized countries. In the\r\nUnited States, an artillery school was established at Fort Monroe, Va.,\r\n1867. Its object is to train both officers and enlisted men in the\r\nconstruction and service of all kinds of artillery and artillery\r\nmaterial, and in gunnery and mathematics as applied in the artillery\r\nservice. For artillery schools in other countries, see MILITARY\r\nACADEMIES.\r\n\r\n=Artillery, Systems of.= See SYSTEMS OF ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n=Artillery-train.= A number of pieces of ordnance mounted on carriages,\r\nwith all their furniture, fit for marching.\r\n\r\n=Arx.= In the ancient military art, a fort, castle, etc., for the\r\ndefense of a place.\r\n\r\n=Arzegages= (_Fr._). Batons or canes with iron at both ends. They were\r\ncarried by the Estradiots, or Albanian cavaliers, who served in France\r\nunder Charles VIII. and Louis XII.\r\n\r\n=Asapes.= An inferior class of Turkish soldiers employed in sieges to\r\nwork in intrenchments and perform other pioneer duty.\r\n\r\n=Asaraouas.= A tribe in Algeria against whom the French undertook an\r\nexpedition in 1837.\r\n\r\n=Ascalon= (Syria).

The city was captured by the Lacedæmonians in 404 B.C., and was\r\nconquered by Sulla, the Roman general, 86 B.C., after which it dwindled\r\ninto insignificance as a maritime city. Its prosperity continued,\r\nhowever, under the Roman sway, and it continued to be famous as the\r\ncentre of philosophy, literature, and art, many famous buildings having\r\nbeen erected there by foreign rulers after the decline of its power.\r\nDuring the Middle Ages it sunk into insignificance.

In cases of\r\nsurprise, when immediate action is required, this method cannot, of\r\ncourse, be practicable.\r\n\r\n=Attention.= A cautionary command addressed to troops preparatory to a\r\nparticular exercise or manœuvre. _Gare-a-vous_ has the same\r\nsignification in the French service.\r\n\r\n=Attestation.= In the English service, is a certificate which is granted\r\nby a justice of the peace within four days after the enlistment of a\r\nrecruit.

This territory, which was\r\ncomprised in Noricum and part of Pannonia, was annexed to the Roman\r\nempire in 33, was overrun by Huns, Avars, etc., in the 5th and 6th\r\ncenturies, and taken from them by Charlemagne, who united it to Germany\r\nas the “eastern kingdom,” 791-96. In 1156 the country was made a\r\nhereditary duchy by the emperor Frederick I., and in 1453 was raised to\r\nan archduchy. Rodolph, count of Hapsburg, elected emperor of Germany in\r\n1273, acquired Austria in 1278, and from 1493 to 1804 his descendants\r\nwere emperors of Germany. On August 11, 1804, Francis II. became\r\nhereditary emperor of Austria.

In the following year,\r\nhowever, both the insurgents and their Sardinian ally were repeatedly\r\ndefeated by the Austrian forces under Marshal Radetzky, and Lombardy was\r\nagain brought under the Austrian sway, but was ceded to Sardinia in\r\n1859.

There is also an apparatus which\r\nrecords the point at which the pendulums pass each other, when they fall\r\nby the breaking of the currents which excite the magnets, two targets\r\nbeing placed so as to support the wires in a position to be cut by the\r\nprojectile. The velocity of the electric currents being considered\r\ninstantaneous, and the loss of the power of the magnets simultaneous\r\nwith the rupture of the currents, it follows that each pendulum begins\r\nto move at the instant that the projectile cuts the wire, and that the\r\ninterval of time corresponds to the difference of the arcs described by\r\nthe pendulums up to the time of meeting.\r\n\r\n=Ballistic Pendulum.= A machine consisting of a massive block of wood\r\nsuspended by a bar.

Bascule is the arrangement of the\r\ncounterpoise in bascule bridges.\r\n\r\n=Base.= In fortifications, is the exterior side of the polygon, or that\r\nimaginary line which connects the salient angle of two adjacent\r\nbastions.\r\n\r\n=Base.= In heraldry, denotes the lower part of the shield.\r\n\r\n=Base-line.= In gunnery, is a line traced around the gun in rear of the\r\nvent; also the measured line used to obtain ranges by triangulation.\r\n\r\n=Base of Operations.= That secure line of frontier or fortresses, or\r\nstrong country occupied by troops, or of sea occupied by fleets, from\r\nwhich forward movements are made, supplies furnished, and upon which a\r\nretreat may be made, if necessary.\r\n\r\n=Base of the Breech.= In gunnery, is the rear surface of the breech of a\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n=Basel, Treaty of.= This place gives its name to two important treaties\r\nof peace, concluded here on April 5 and July 22, 1795, between the\r\nrepresentatives of the French Republic, Prussia, and Spain, by which\r\nPrussia withdrew from the coalition against France, took under her\r\nprotection all the states of Northern Germany which should like herself\r\nrelinquish the war in which the German empire was engaged, and also give\r\nup to the victorious republic her possessions beyond the Rhine; whilst\r\nSpain gave up her portion of St. Domingo, and prepared the way for that\r\nalliance with France which was afterwards productive of consequences so\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n=Base-ring.= In gunnery, is a projecting band of metal adjoining the\r\nbase of the breech, and connected with the body of the gun by a concave\r\nmoulding.\r\n\r\n=Bashaw.= See PASHA.\r\n\r\n=Bashi-Bazouks.= Are irregular troops in the pay of the sultan. Very few\r\nof them are Europeans; they are mostly Asiatics, from some of the\r\npashalics in Asiatic Turkey; they are wild, turbulent men, ready to\r\nenter the sultan’s service under some leader whom they can understand,\r\nand still more ready to plunder whenever an opportunity offers. During\r\nthe Russo-Turkish war of 1854, etc., they had many encounters with the\r\nenemy in that kind of irregular warfare which the Russians intrust to\r\nCossack horsemen; but the peaceful villagers had almost as much distrust\r\nof the Bashi-Bazouks as of the Russians. They were also partially\r\nemployed by the British during the Crimean war.\r\n\r\n=Bashkirs.= A race supposed to be descended from the Nogay Tartars, who\r\ninhabit the Russian provinces of Ufa and Yekaterinboorg, in the\r\ngovernments of Orenburg and Perm respectively.

Here the army of Otto II., in an\r\nambuscade, was nearly cut to pieces by the Greeks and Saracens, July 13,\r\n982; the emperor barely escaped.\r\n\r\n=Basilisk.= An ancient piece of ordnance, which was 10 feet long and\r\nweighed 7200 pounds; so called from its supposed resemblance to the\r\nserpent of that name, or from its size.\r\n\r\n=Basillard.= An old term for a poniard.\r\n\r\n=Basket-hilt.= The hilt of a sword, so made as to contain and guard the\r\nwhole hand.\r\n\r\n=Basket-hilted.= Having a hilt of basket-work.\r\n\r\n=Baskets.= See GABION.\r\n\r\n=Baslard.= A short sword or dagger, worn in the 15th century.\r\n\r\n=Basnet.= See BASCINET.\r\n\r\n=Basque Provinces= (Northwest Spain, Biscay, Guipuzcoa, and Alva). The\r\nBasques, considered to be descendants of the ancient Iberi, were termed\r\nVascones by the Romans, whom they successfully resisted. They were\r\nsubdued with great difficulty by the Goths about 580, and were united to\r\nCastile in the 13th and 14th centuries.\r\n\r\n=Basque Roads= (Western France). Four French ships of the line, riding\r\nat anchor here, were attacked by Lords Gambier and Cochrane (the latter\r\ncommanding the fire-ships), and all, with a great number of merchant and\r\nother vessels, were destroyed, April 11-12, 1809. Cochrane accused\r\nGambier of neglecting to support him, and thereby allowing the French to\r\nescape. At a court-martial Lord Gambier was acquitted.\r\n\r\n=Bassée, La.= A town in the department of the North, France, formerly\r\nfortified. It sustained several sieges. Louis XIV. captured it from the\r\nSpaniards and caused it to be dismantled.\r\n\r\n=Basseterre Roads=, St. Christopher’s, West Indies. Here the French\r\nadmiral, the Comte de Grasse, was repulsed with loss in three desperate\r\nattacks on the British fleet, commanded by Sir Thomas Graves, January\r\n25-26, 1782.\r\n\r\n=Basson= (Northern Italy). Here the Austrians under Wurmser were\r\ndefeated by the French under Massena, September 8, 1796.\r\n\r\n=Bassorah=, =Basrah=, or =Bussorah= (Asia Minor). A Turkish city,\r\nfounded by the Caliph Omar about 635. It has been several times taken\r\nand retaken by the Persians and Turks.\r\n\r\n=Bass Rock.= An isle in the Frith of Forth, Southern Scotland; granted\r\nto the Landers in 1316; purchased for a state prison, 1671; taken by the\r\nJacobites, 1690; surrendered, 1694; granted to the Dalrymples, 1706.\r\n\r\n=Bastard=, or =Batarde= (_Fr._). An ancient piece of ordnance of about 8\r\npounds calibre, 9¹⁄₂ feet long, and weighing 1950 pounds. It was\r\ninvented by Jean Maurique de Lard, master-general of ordnance under\r\nCharles V. of France in 1535. He also had several bastards cast of a\r\nlarger calibre. This term was also applied to guns of an unusual make or\r\nproportion, whether longer or shorter.\r\n\r\n=Bastarnæ=, or =Basternæ=. A warlike German people who migrated to the\r\ncountry near the mouth of the Danube. They are first mentioned in the\r\nwars of Philip and Perseus against the Romans, and at a later period\r\nthey frequently devastated Thrace, and were engaged in wars with the\r\nRoman governors of the province of Macedonia. In 30 B.C. they were\r\ndefeated by Marcus Crassus, and driven across the Danube, and we find\r\nthem, at a later period, partly settled between the Tyras (now\r\n_Dniester_) and Borysthenes (now _Dnieper_), and partly at the mouth of\r\nthe Danube, under the name of _Peucini_, from their inhabiting the\r\nisland of Peuce, at the mouth of the river.\r\n\r\n=Bastia.= A fortified seaport town, and formerly capital of Corsica, on\r\nits northeast coast, and 67 miles from Ajaccio; besieged without success\r\nby the Piedmontese in 1748; captured by the English, 1794.\r\n\r\n=Bastide= (_Fr._). In ancient times, a bastion, block-house, fortress,\r\nor outer fortifications.\r\n\r\n=Bastile.= Originally, a temporary wooden tower used in warfare; hence,\r\nany tower or fortification.\r\n\r\n=Bastile=, or =Bastille= (Paris). A castle built by Charles V., king of\r\nFrance, in 1369, for the defense of Paris against the English; completed\r\nin 1383, and afterwards used as a state prison. Henry IV. and his\r\nveteran army assailed it in vain in the siege of Paris during the war,\r\n1587-94. On July 14-15, 1789, it was pulled down by the populace, the\r\ngovernor and other officers seized, conducted to the Place de Grève,\r\ntheir hands and heads were cut off, and the heads carried on pikes\r\nthrough the streets.\r\n\r\n=Bastinado.= A punishment among the Turkish soldiers, which is performed\r\nby beating them with a cane or flat of a sword on the soles of their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n=Bastion.= A work consisting of two faces and two flanks, all the angles\r\nbeing salient. Two bastions are connected by means of a curtain, which\r\nis screened by the angle made by the prolongation of the corresponding\r\nfaces of two bastions, and flanked by the line of defense. Bastions\r\ncontain, sheltered by their parapets, marksmen, artillery, platform, and\r\nguards. They are protected by galleries of mines, and by demi-lunes and\r\nlunettes outside the ditch, and by palisades, if the ditch is inundated.\r\nThe _faces_ of the bastion are the parts exposed to being enfiladed by\r\nricochet batteries, and also to being battered in breach.\r\n\r\nBASTION, COMPOSED, is where two sides of the interior polygon are very\r\nunequal, which makes the gorges also unequal.\r\n\r\nBASTION, CUT, is that which, instead of a point, has a re-entering\r\nangle.\r\n\r\nBASTION, DEFORMED, is when the irregularity of the lines and angles puts\r\nthe bastion out of shape; as, when it wants a demi-gorge, one side of\r\nthe interior polygon being too short.\r\n\r\nBASTION, DEMI, is that which has only one face and one flank, cut off by\r\nthe capital,--like the extremities of horn- and crown-works.\r\n\r\nBASTION, DOUBLE, is that which is raised on the plane of another\r\nbastion.\r\n\r\nBASTION, FLAT, is a bastion built in the middle of the curtain, when it\r\nis too long to be defended by the bastions at its extremes.\r\n\r\nBASTIONS, HOLLOW, are those surrounded only with a rampart and parapet,\r\nhaving the space within unoccupied where the ground is so low that no\r\nretrenchment can be made in the centre in the event of the rampart being\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nBASTION, REGULAR, is that which has true proportion of faces, flanks,\r\nand gorges.\r\n\r\nBASTIONS, SOLID, are those which have the void space within them filled\r\nentirely, and raised of an equal height with the rampart.\r\n\r\n=Bastioned Fort.= A fort having bastions.\r\n\r\n=Baston.= A staff or cudgel formerly used in tournaments. In heraldry, a\r\nstaff or cudgel generally borne as a mark of bastardy, and properly\r\ncontaining one-eighth in breadth of the bend-sinister.\r\n\r\n=Bat de Mulet= (_Fr._). A pack-saddle used on service when mules are\r\nemployed to carry stores. Aparejos in the United States service are used\r\nfor a similar purpose. See PACK-SADDLES.\r\n\r\n=Batage= (_Fr._). The time employed in reducing gunpowder to its proper\r\nconsistency. The French usually consumed 24 hours in pounding the\r\nmaterials to make good gunpowder. Supposing the mortar to contain 16\r\npounds of composition, it would require the application of the pestle\r\n3500 times each hour. The labor required in this process is less in\r\nsummer than in winter, because the water is softer.\r\n\r\n=Bataillon de la Salade= (_Fr._). A name formerly given in France to old\r\ncorps which wore a peculiar kind of helmet called salade. See SALADE.\r\n\r\n=Batardeau= (_Fr._). A wall built across a ditch or fortification, with\r\na sluice-gate by which the height of the water in the ditch on both\r\nsides may be regulated. To prevent this wall being used as a passage\r\nacross the ditch, it is built up to an angle at the top, and armed with\r\niron spikes; and to render the attempt to cross still more difficult, a\r\ntower of masonry is built on it.\r\n\r\n=Batavia and Batavian Republic.= See HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n=Bateau= (_Fr._). A light boat.\r\n\r\n=Bateau-bridge.= Is a floating bridge supported by bateaux or light\r\nboats. See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Bateau d’Avant-garde= (_Fr._). A small light boat attached to the\r\nadvance-guard of an army. It is 33 feet in length by 5 feet 6 inches in\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\n=Bate Isle.= An island of Hindostan, belonging to the province of\r\nGuzerat, situated at the southwestern extremity of the Gulf of Cutch.\r\nIt was formerly a rendezvous for pirates, who were the dread of all\r\ntraders on the western coast of India. In 1803 a naval force, consisting\r\nof a British frigate and two Bombay cruisers, succeeded in destroying\r\nseveral of the pirate boats and vessels; but an attack upon the castle,\r\nthough conducted under the fire of the ships, was repulsed with some\r\nloss. In 1807 a treaty was entered into with the chiefs of the island,\r\nwhereby they consented to relinquish their piratical practices.\r\n\r\n=Bath, Knights of the.= See ORDER OF KNIGHTS OF THE BATH.\r\n\r\n=Bat-horse.= A baggage horse which bears the bat or pack.\r\n\r\n=Bat-man.= A servant in charge of the bat-horses. The term is now\r\napplied in the English service to a soldier who acts as servant to an\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n=Baton.= A truncheon borne by generals in the French army, and\r\nafterwards by the marshals of other nations. Henry III. of France before\r\nhe ascended the throne was made generalissimo of the army of his brother\r\nCharles IX., and received the baton as the mark of the high command,\r\n1569.\r\n\r\n=Baton.= A staff used by drum-majors of foot regiments.\r\n\r\n=Baton Rouge.= A city of Louisiana. It was captured by the Federals\r\nAugust 5, 1862, after a fierce conflict.\r\n\r\n=Batourin.= A town of Russia, 63 miles east of Tcheringov, on the Seim.\r\nIt was the residing place of the hetman of the Ukraine Cossacks from\r\n1699 to 1708; captured and sacked by the Russians in 1708.\r\n\r\n=Batta.= An allowance made to military officers in the service of the\r\nEast India Company in addition to their pay. See HALF-BATTA.\r\n\r\n=Battalia.= The order of battle; disposition or arrangement of troops,\r\nbrigades, regiments, battalions, etc., as for action. Formerly the term\r\napplied to the main body of an army in array, as distinguished from the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n=Battailant.= Equipped for battle; warlike; a combatant. This word is\r\nnow obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Battalion.= A body of troops, so called from being originally a body of\r\nmen arranged for battle; consisting in European armies of about 800 or\r\n1000 men; in the U. S. service, an aggregation of from two to twelve\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n=Battard.= An early cannon of small size.\r\n\r\n=Batten.= The sloping of a wall which brings the perpendicular from the\r\ntop inside the base.\r\n\r\n=Batter.= A cannonade of heavy ordnance, from the first or second\r\nparallel of intrenchment, against any fortress or works. To batter _in\r\nbreach_ implies a heavy cannonade of many pieces directed to one part of\r\nthe revetment from the third parallel.\r\n\r\n=Batterie en Rouage= (_Fr._). Is an enfilading battery, when directed\r\nagainst another battery.\r\n\r\n=Battering.= In military affairs, implies the firing with heavy\r\nartillery on some fortification or strong post possessed by an enemy, in\r\norder to demolish the works.\r\n\r\n=Battering Charge.= The charge of powder used in battering. The heaviest\r\ncharge used in a gun.\r\n\r\n=Battering-pieces.= Are large pieces of ordnance, used in battering a\r\nfortified town or post.\r\n\r\n=Battering-ram.= In antiquity, a military engine used to batter and beat\r\ndown the walls of places besieged. There were two different kinds of\r\nbattering-rams, one rude and plain, the other compound. The former seems\r\nto have been no more than a great beam, which the soldiers bore on their\r\narms and shoulders, and with one end of it, by main force, assailed the\r\nwalls. The compound ram was a large beam with a head of iron, which was\r\nsometimes made to resemble the head of a ram. It was suspended by ropes\r\nto a beam supported by posts, and balanced so as to swing backwards and\r\nforwards, and was impelled by men against the wall. These rams were\r\nsometimes 120 feet in length.\r\n\r\n=Battering-train.= A train of artillery used solely for besieging a\r\nstrong place, inclusive of mortars and howitzers. See SIEGE-TRAIN.\r\n\r\n=Battery.= A battery consists of two or more pieces of artillery in the\r\nfield. The term battery also implies the implacement of ordnance\r\ndestined to act offensively or defensively. It also refers to the\r\ncompany charged with a certain number of pieces of ordnance. The\r\nordnance constitutes the battery; men serve it; horses drag it, and\r\nepaulments may shelter it.\r\n\r\nAMBULANT BATTERY, heavy guns mounted on traveling carriages, and moved\r\nas occasion may require, either to positions on the coast or in besieged\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nBARBETTE BATTERIES are those without embrasures, in which the guns are\r\nraised to fire over the parapet.\r\n\r\nBATTERY D’ENFILADE is one that sweeps the whole length of a line, or the\r\nface or flank of any work.\r\n\r\nBATTERY DE REVERSE is one which plays upon the rear of the troops\r\nappointed to defend a place.\r\n\r\nBATTERY EN ECHARPE is that which plays obliquely.\r\n\r\nBREACHING BATTERY. See BREACH.\r\n\r\nCOVERED, or MASKED BATTERY is when the cannon and gunners are covered by\r\na bank or breastwork, commonly made of brushwood, fagots, and earth.\r\n\r\nCROSS-BATTERIES are two batteries which play athwart each other upon the\r\nsame object, forming there an angle, and battering with more effect,\r\nbecause what one battery shakes the other beats down.\r\n\r\nFACINE and GABION BATTERIES are batteries constructed of those machines\r\nwhere sods are scarce, and the earth very loose and sandy.\r\n\r\nFLOATING BATTERIES are such as are erected either on rafts or on the\r\nhulls of ships.\r\n\r\nGUN-BATTERY is a defense constructed of earth faced with green sods or\r\nfascines, sometimes of gabions filled with earth. It consists of a\r\nbreastwork, epaulment, or parapet; the open spaces through which the\r\nmuzzles of the cannon are pointed are called _embrasures_, and the solid\r\nmasses between the embrasures, _merlons_; the _genouilleres_ are those\r\nparts of the parapet which cover the carriage of the gun. The platforms\r\nare plank floors made to prevent the cannon from sinking into the\r\nground; they are made with a slope to check the recoil of the guns, and\r\nto render it more easy to bring them forward again when loaded.\r\n\r\nHALF-SUNKEN BATTERY. This term is applied to a battery in which the\r\nearth to form the parapet is derived partly from a ditch in front and\r\npartly from the excavation of the terre-plein. See ARTILLERY, also\r\nCAVALIER.\r\n\r\nMORTAR-BATTERIES differ from gun-batteries in this, that the parapets\r\nhave no embrasures, and the platforms have no slope, but are exactly\r\nhorizontal; the shells being fired quite over the parapet, commonly at\r\nan elevation of 45°.\r\n\r\nOPEN BATTERY is a number of cannon, commonly field-pieces, ranged in a\r\nrow abreast on some natural elevation of ground, or on an artificial\r\nbank raised for that purpose.\r\n\r\nRAISED BATTERY, one whose terre-plein is elevated considerably above the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nREDAN BATTERIES are such as flank each other at the salient and\r\nre-entrant angles of a fortification.\r\n\r\nRICOCHET BATTERY, so called by its inventor Vauban, was first used at\r\nthe siege of Aeth in 1697. It is a method of discharging cannon with a\r\nvery small charge of powder, and with just elevation enough to fire over\r\nthe parapet. When properly managed its effects are most destructive; for\r\nthe shot, rolling along the opposite rampart, dismounts the cannon and\r\ndisperses or destroys the troops. Ricochet practice is not confined to\r\ncannon alone; small mortars and howitzers may be effectually employed\r\nfor the same purpose.\r\n\r\nSUNKEN BATTERY, where the sole of the embrasures is on a level with the\r\nground, and the platforms are consequently sunk below it.\r\n\r\n=Battery-boxes= are square chests or boxes, filled with earth or dung;\r\nused in making batteries, where gabions and earth are not to be had.\r\nThey must not be too large, but of a size that is governable.\r\n\r\n=Battery-wagon.= It consists, besides the limber, of a long-bodied cart\r\nwith a round top, which is connected with the limber in the same way as\r\nall other field-carriages. The lid opens on hinges placed at the side;\r\nand in the rear is fixed a movable forage-rack for carrying along\r\nforage. One of these wagons accompanies each field battery, for the\r\npurpose of transporting carriage-maker’s and saddler’s tools, spare\r\nparts of carriages, harness, and equipments, and rough materials for\r\nreplacing different parts. Both it and the forge are made of equal\r\nmobility with the other field-carriages, in order to accompany them\r\nwherever they may be required to go. See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Battery, Electric.= The apparatus used to generate a current of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n=Battery=, or =Traveling Forge=. See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Battery Gun.= A gun capable of firing continuously a great number of\r\nshots in a short time. Applied to guns mounted upon tripods, stands,\r\nswivels, or carriages. A _magazine cannon_ in contradistinction to a\r\nmagazine small-arm. Also called _machine gun_ and _mitrailleur_. Guns of\r\nthis kind existed as early as the 14th century. From the arrangement of\r\nthe barrels they were called _killing organs_. They have always been\r\nused in various forms, but were comparatively inefficient till recent\r\ntimes, when the introduction of the metallic cartridge gave the subject\r\na new importance.\r\n\r\n_Puckle’s revolver_, 1718, was ingeniously mounted upon a tripod with\r\ngood elevating and traversing arrangements. It had one barrel and a\r\nmovable rotating breech containing nine charges. These were fired in\r\nsuccession, and a new breech, ready charged, was slipped on. Two kinds\r\nof bullets were used,--round bullets against Christians and square ones\r\nfor Turks.\r\n\r\n_Winans’s steam gun_, invented about 1861 by the celebrated American\r\ninventor and engineer Thomas Winans, of Baltimore, was a battery gun of\r\nlarge calibre. The shot fell from a hopper into a breech-chamber, and\r\nwere projected through the barrel by the sudden admission behind it of\r\nsteam under enormous pressure.\r\n\r\nThe _infernal machine_ with which Fieschi killed Marshal Mortier and a\r\nlarge number of others in his attempt to assassinate Louis Philippe, in\r\n1835, was a crude form of battery gun, consisting of a row of\r\ngun-barrels fired by a train of powder. Many battery guns are of this\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe _Requa battery_--American--used in the civil war, 1861-65, consisted\r\nof a row of 24 barrels on a wheel-carriage, so arranged as to give\r\neither parallel or divergent fire. It was breech-loading, the cartridges\r\nbeing forced into the barrels by a transverse bar worked by levers. It\r\nwas capable of seven volleys a minute.\r\n\r\nOne of the forms of _mitrailleur_ used in the Franco-Prussian war was\r\nvery much the same. The loading-bar was rotating, and had two sets of\r\nchambers. One set was fired while the other was being loaded.\r\n\r\nThe _Abbertini gun_ used in Europe has 10 barrels arranged as in the\r\nRequa battery. It is worked by a crank. The cartridges are conveyed by\r\nmechanical devices from a box magazine to the rear of the barrels.\r\n\r\nThe form in which a _cluster of barrels_ is used was probably first\r\nintroduced in France, and was made by inserting 25 gun-barrels into the\r\nbore of a brass field-piece, into the breech of which a slot was cut,\r\nthe open rear ends of the barrels being flush with the front wall of the\r\nslot. A cylinder-case containing cartridges being placed in the slot, a\r\nset of plungers pushed the cartridges into the barrels. The case was\r\nthen replaced by a firing-block containing a lock and pin for each\r\ncartridge.\r\n\r\nThis was improved by mounting the barrels (37) without the casing and\r\nreplacing the cartridge-case by a steel block in which the cartridges\r\nwere fired without being pushed into the barrels.\r\n\r\nThe first successful gun in which the _cluster of barrels_ was made to\r\nrevolve was the Gatling. (See GATLING GUN.) In this both the barrels and\r\nthe locks revolve. The Gatling gun in its various forms is used by all\r\nthe leading nations of Europe. It is used in a variety of ways for field\r\nservice, mountain service, flank defense of fortifications, in the\r\nmain-tops of ships, etc. It has been mounted upon the backs of camels,\r\non tripods, swivels, and field-carriages. In Europe its principal rival\r\nis the _Nordenfelt_, in which the barrels are stationary and the breech\r\nmechanism works horizontally. It is probably superior to the Gatling in\r\nthe amount of metal thrown in a given time. In mechanism and accuracy it\r\nis inferior. Its principal claim to superiority is that it fires either\r\nvolleys or single shots. The recoil, which is always great in\r\nvolley-guns, requires a very heavy stand, making it clumsy and unwieldy\r\ncompared to the Gatling. Accidents have also happened in its use from\r\ndefective mechanism. Among other American battery or machine guns are\r\nthe _Lowell_ and _Gardner_, both of which have won enviable reputations.\r\nA late form of the Gardner consists of two barrels fixed in a brass\r\ncasing, giving it the external appearance of an ordinary field-piece. It\r\nhas less rapidity of fire (its maximum being about 357 shots a minute)\r\nthan some other guns, but it is simple, strong, and efficient.\r\n\r\nThe _Taylor gun_ was something like the Nordenfelt in principle, having\r\na fixed cluster of barrels and a sliding breech mechanism, firing\r\nvolleys or single shots at discretion. A later form of Taylor gun has\r\nthe barrels in a horizontal row. The improvement consists in rapidity of\r\nloading. The cartridges are carried in the ordinary paper or wooden\r\ncases, exposing the heads. The gun has a number of upright pieces at the\r\nbreech with grooves between them. By drawing the cartridge-case downward\r\nover these uprights the cartridges are caught in the grooves by their\r\nflanged heads. They fall by gravity, and are conducted by suitable\r\ndevices in grooved channels to the barrels. This gun, it is believed,\r\nfires more shots a minute than any other, but its mechanism is not so\r\nperfect as several of its rivals.\r\n\r\nThe _Hotchkiss revolving cannon_ has the largest calibre of the modern\r\nmachine guns. It differs from the Gatling in having but one lock for all\r\nthe barrels. It is worked by a crank like the Gatling, but the mechanism\r\nis such that during a part of the revolution of the crank the barrels\r\nare stationary. It is during this time that one cartridge is fired and\r\nanother case extracted. The rapidity of fire is much less than the\r\nGatling and most others, but in perfection of mechanism, accuracy, and\r\nother qualities, it is unsurpassed. A peculiar form of brake is fitted\r\nto the wheels of the field-gun to prevent the recoil from moving the\r\ncarriage. For the larger sizes both shells and canister are used. The\r\nmetallic cartridge-case is of brass. This gun is the invention of B. B.\r\nHotchkiss, an American, now residing in Paris. His guns are made at the\r\nHotchkiss Works, near that city, and have been adopted for flank defense\r\nof fortifications and for naval use by several of the continental\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n=Battle.= An action or engagement between the forces of two armies. A\r\nbattle is either general or partial; general, where the whole or the\r\ngreater part of each army is brought into action; and partial, where\r\nonly brigades, divisions, or _corps d’armée_ are engaged. But, however\r\nthe numbers may vary, the great principles to be applied in delivering\r\nbattle are in almost every case the same. Palamedes of Argos is said to\r\nhave been the first who ranged an army in order of battle, placed\r\nsentinels round a camp, and excited the soldier’s vigilance by giving\r\nhim a watch-word.\r\n\r\nBATTLES may be arranged into three general classes, _defensive_,\r\n_offensive_, and _mixed_ battles. In a purely _defensive_ battle, an\r\narmy chooses a position in which to await the enemy, and there to give\r\nbattle with no other end in view than to hold this position and repulse\r\nthe enemy. In a purely _offensive_ battle, an army seeks the enemy and\r\nattacks him wherever he is to be found. A _mixed_ battle, is a\r\ncombination of these two. The most common case of this last class is\r\nthat in which a position is selected beforehand, where the army awaits\r\nthe attack of the enemy, and, at a suitable moment, moves from it, and\r\nattacks the assaulting columns. This case is sometimes known as a\r\n_defensive-offensive_ battle. Details of particular battles and\r\nengagements are given under their respective headings in this work.\r\n\r\n=Battle-Abbey.= In Sussex, England; founded by William I. 1067, on the\r\nplain where the battle of Hastings was fought, October 14, 1066. It was\r\ndedicated to St. Martin, and given to Benedictine monks, who were to\r\npray for the souls of the slain. The original name of the plain was\r\nHetheland. After the battle of Hastings, a list was taken of William’s\r\nchiefs, amounting to 629, and called the _Battle-Roll_; and among these\r\nchiefs the lands and distinctions of the followers of the defeated\r\nHarold were distributed.\r\n\r\n=Battle-array.= Array or order of battle; the disposition of forces\r\npreparatory to a battle.\r\n\r\n=Battle-axe.= A weapon much used by the early northern nations, Celtic\r\nand Scandinavian, requiring great strength in its use. Some were held\r\nwith one hand, some with two; the former kind could be wielded equally\r\nby horse and foot, but the latter was for foot soldiers only. The\r\nbattle-axe has a longer handle, and a broader, stronger, and sharper\r\nblade than the common axe. During the Middle Ages and somewhat earlier,\r\nit was much used in sorties, and to prevent the escalading of a besieged\r\nfortress. The _pole-axe_ differed but little from the battle-axe. The\r\n_black-bill_ and _brown-bill_ were a sort of halbert, having a cutting\r\npart like a woodman’s bill, with a spike projecting from the back, and\r\nanother from the head. The _glaive_ was a kind of pole-axe or bill used\r\nby the Welsh.\r\n\r\n=Battle-cries.= See WAR-CRIES.\r\n\r\n=Battle-ground.= A village of Tippecanoe Co., Ind., where the battle of\r\nTippecanoe was fought, November 7, 1811, between Gen. Harrison and the\r\nIndians under the chief Tecumseh and his brother the “Prophet.”\r\n\r\n=Battlements.= The indentations in the top of old castles, or fortified\r\nwalls, in the form of embrasures, for the greater convenience of firing\r\nor looking through.\r\n\r\n=Battle of the Giants.= See MARIGNANO.\r\n\r\n=Battle of the Herrings.= A name given by historians to an engagement\r\nwhich took place February 12, 1429, in which Sir John Fastolfe, an\r\nEnglish general at the head of 1500 men, gained a victory over 6000\r\nFrenchmen near Orleans, and brought a convoy of stores in safety to the\r\nEnglish camp before that place. The stores comprised a large quantity of\r\nherrings.\r\n\r\n=Battle of the Nations.= See LEIPSIC.\r\n\r\n=Battle of the Spurs.= A name given to the battle of Courtrai (which\r\nsee); also to that of Guinegate. See GUINEGATE.\r\n\r\n=Battle of the Standard.= A name given to a battle between the English\r\nand Scotch at Northallerton (which see).\r\n\r\n=Battle of the Thirty.= A name given in English and French history to a\r\ncelebrated engagement which took place at a spot known as Midway Oak,\r\nhalf-way between the castles of Josselin and Ploermel, in France, March\r\n27, 1351. The French general Beaumanoir, commanding at the former place,\r\nbeing enraged at the English general Bemborough, occupying the latter\r\nposition, challenged him to fight. Upon this it was agreed that 30\r\nknights of each party should meet and decide the contest. At the first\r\nonset the English were successful, but Bemborough having been killed,\r\nthe French renewed the struggle with redoubled courage, and finally won\r\nthe victory.\r\n\r\n=Battle-range.= The range corresponding to the maximum “dangerous\r\nspace” for the trajectory of any fire-arm. This range is somewhat\r\ngreater for such fire-arm employed against mounted troops than against\r\nfoot troops. For instance, it is 262 yards for the Springfield rifle\r\n(calibre .45) when used against foot troops, and represents the extreme\r\nrange for which the rear sight may be set so as to cover such foot\r\ntroops continuously between that point and the firer. There is also a\r\n“dangerous space” of 75 yards behind that point for the foot soldier;\r\nhence the maximum “dangerous space” is 337 yards, and is a continuous\r\none. For the same arm and against cavalry, the “battle-range” is 291\r\nyards, corresponding to a maximum continuous “dangerous space,” front\r\nand rear, of (291 + 95 =) 386 yards. For the carbine (cal. .45) against\r\ninfantry, this range is 204 yards, and the maximum “dangerous space” is\r\n300 yards. Upon the latest model sights (1879) for these two fire-arms,\r\nthe letter “_B_” is placed opposite the “battle-range” elevation, and\r\nindicates the most suitable one for firing at an enemy’s line of battle;\r\nwith this elevation and the aim taken at the foot, the enemy will be hit\r\nwherever he may be within a range of about 400 yards. The most effective\r\nfire, and one covering the greatest zone of continuous “dangerous\r\nspace,” can be secured by causing troops to lie down, to fire at the\r\nfeet of the opposing line, and to use the “battle” elevation. The zone\r\nthen swept will be round about 500 yards for troops armed with the\r\nservice rifle. See DANGEROUS SPACE.\r\n\r\n=Battle, The Fearless.= An engagement between the Lacedæmonians under\r\nArchidamus III. and the Arcadians.\r\n\r\n=Battre= (_Fr._). To direct one or more pieces of ordnance in such a\r\nmanner that any given object may be destroyed or broken into by the\r\ncontinued discharge of cannon-ball, or other warlike material; it\r\nlikewise means to silence an enemy’s fire.\r\n\r\n=Battre de Front= (_Fr._). To throw cannon-balls in a perpendicular or\r\nalmost perpendicular direction against any body or place which becomes\r\nan object of attack. This mode of attack is less effectual than any\r\nother unless _battering in breach_.\r\n\r\n=Baulois.= A piece of punk stuff, used by miners for firing the\r\nsaucision, or train.\r\n\r\n=Bavaria.= A kingdom in South Germany; conquered from the Celtic Gauls\r\nby the Franks, between 630 and 660. The country was afterwards governed\r\nby dukes subject to the French monarchs. Tasillon II. was deposed by\r\nCharlemagne, who established margraves in 788. Henry the Lion, duke of\r\nSaxony, Bavaria, and Brunswick, was dispossessed in 1180 by the emperor\r\nFrederick Barbarossa (who had previously been his friend and\r\nbenefactor.) Bavaria supported Austria in the contest with Prussia in\r\nJune, 1866, and took part in the war; made peace with Prussia August 22.\r\nTook part with Prussia against the French in the Franco-Prussian war,\r\n1870.\r\n\r\n=Bavier.= The beaver of a helmet.\r\n\r\n=Bavin.= The old word for fascine.\r\n\r\n=Bayberry Tallow.= A product of the wax myrtle, used as lubricant for\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\n=Bayeux.= A city in the department of Calvados, France, 17 miles\r\nwest-northwest of Caen; captured and sacked by Henry I. of England in\r\n1106; by Philip of Navarre in 1356; the English took possession of it,\r\n1450; the Protestants in 1561; Lamoricière for the League in 1589, and\r\nthe Duke of Montpensier in 1590.\r\n\r\n=Baylen.= A town in Southern Spain, where on July 20, 1808, the French,\r\ncommanded by Gens. Dupont and Wedel, were defeated by the Spaniards\r\nunder Reding, Coupigny, and other generals, whose force amounted to\r\n25,000.\r\n\r\n=Bayonet.= A triangular dagger, made with a hollow handle and a\r\nshoulder, to fix on the muzzle of a rifle, so that its presence does not\r\nimpede either the charging or firing of the piece. It is said to have\r\nbeen invented at Bayonne, in France, about 1647, 1670, or 1690. It was\r\nused at Killiecrankie in 1689, and at Marsaglia by the French in 1693,\r\n“with great success against the enemy, unprepared for the encounter with\r\nso formidable a novelty.” Bayonets are sometimes made in other shapes.\r\nSee SWORD-BAYONET and TROWEL-BAYONET.\r\n\r\n=Bayonet Exercise.= A drill in fencing with the bayonet fixed on the\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n=Bayonet Scabbard.= A leather or metallic case for carrying the bayonet\r\nsuspended from the belt.\r\n\r\n=Bayonne.= An ancient city in Southern France, at the confluence of the\r\nAdour and Nive; held by the British from 1295 till it was taken by\r\nCharles VII. The queens of Spain and France met here in 1565 the cruel\r\nDuke of Alva, it is supposed to arrange the massacre of St. Bartholomew.\r\nCharles IV. of Spain abdicated here in favor of his “friend and ally,”\r\nthe emperor Napoleon, May 4, 1808. In the neighborhood of Bayonne was\r\nmuch desperate fighting between the French and English armies, December\r\n10, 11, and 13, 1813; invested by the British January 14, 1814; on April\r\n14, the French made a sally and attacked the English with success, but\r\nwere at length driven back. The loss of the British was considerable,\r\nand Lieut.-Gen. Sir John Hope was wounded and taken prisoner.\r\n\r\n=Bayou.= A long and narrow place; a branch of a trench in fortification;\r\na hose or leathern pipe; the outlet of a lake; a channel for water.\r\n\r\n=Baza.= A city in Andalusia, Spain; it was taken by the Spaniards under\r\nFerdinand V. from the Moors in December, 1489, after a siege of nearly\r\nseven months; in 1810 the Spaniards under Gens. Blake and Freire were\r\ndefeated by the French under Marshal Soult.\r\n\r\n=Bazar.= The sutler establishment which accompanies a native regiment in\r\nthe India service wherever it goes.\r\n\r\n=Bazeilles.= A village in the Ardennes, Northeast France. During the\r\ndreadful battle of Sedan, September 1, 1870, Bazeilles was burnt by the\r\nBavarians, and outrages committed. Of nearly 2000 inhabitants scarcely\r\n50 remained alive, and these indignantly denied having given\r\nprovocation. The cause of provocation appears to have been that an old\r\nwoman whose husband and sons had been killed had fired upon and killed\r\ntwo Bavarians.\r\n\r\n=Bazoche-des-Hautes.= Near Orleans, Central France. Here a part of the\r\narmy of the Loire, under Gen. d’Aurelle de Paladines, was defeated after\r\na severe action by the Germans under the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg,\r\nDecember 2, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Beach-master.= Formerly a superior officer, appointed to superintend\r\nthe disembarkation of an attacking force, who holds plenary powers, and\r\ngenerally leads the storming-party. His acts when in the heat of action\r\nare unquestioned.\r\n\r\n=Beachy Head.= A promontory, Southeast Sussex, England, near which the\r\nBritish and Dutch fleets, commanded by the earl of Torrington, were\r\ndefeated by a superior French force under Admiral Tourville, June 30,\r\n1690; the allies suffered very severely. The Dutch lost 2 admirals, 500\r\nmen, and several ships,--sunk to prevent them from falling into the\r\nhands of the enemy; the English lost 2 ships and 400 men. The admirals\r\non both sides were blamed,--the English for not fighting, the French for\r\nnot pursuing the victory.\r\n\r\n=Beacon.= A signal-fire to notify the approach of an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Bear.= In a military sense, a piece of ordnance is said to _bear_, or\r\n_come_ to _bear_, or is _brought_ to _bear_, when pointed directly\r\nagainst the object; that is, pointed to hit the object.\r\n\r\n=Bear, Order of.= Was a military order in Switzerland, instituted by the\r\nemperor Frederick II. in 1213, by way of acknowledgment for the service\r\nthe Swiss had done him, and in favor of the abbey of St. Gall.

If one of the combatants did not appear in the field at the\r\ntime appointed, the other was to make so many flourishes with his\r\nweapon, by which he was entitled to all the advantages of a conqueror.\r\n\r\n=Beaucéant=, or =Beaucent= (_Fr._). Standard of the Knights Templar; it\r\nwas white on one side and black on the other.\r\n\r\n=Beaugency.= An ancient town of France, in the department of Loiret, and\r\nsituated on the right bank of the Loire. It was at one time surrounded\r\nby walls, flanked with towers and bastions, and defended by a strong\r\ncastle, now ruined. In the history of the wars of France Beaugency\r\noccupies a conspicuous place; it was successively in the hands of the\r\nHuns, Saxons, Normans, and English, but the town sustained most damage\r\nduring the religious wars of the 16th century.\r\n\r\n=Beaumont.= A town in the department of the Somme, France; here the\r\nFrench routed the allies, June 16, 1815.\r\n\r\n=Beaumont.= A village near Sedan, department of Ardennes, Northeast\r\nFrance. Near here a part of the army of Marshal MacMahon, under De\r\nFailly, which, after vainly endeavoring to reach Metz, was retreating\r\nbefore the Germans under the crown prince of Prussia, was surprised,\r\ndefeated, and driven across the Meuse at Mouzon, August 30, 1870. The\r\nFrench loss included about 7000 prisoners, many guns, and much camp\r\nequipage. The victory was chiefly gained by the Bavarians.\r\n\r\n=Beaune-la-Rolande.= A village in the Loiret, France. Here the French\r\narmy of the Loire under Gen. d’Aurelle de Paladines was defeated by the\r\nGermans under Prince Frederick Charles, in an attempt to march in the\r\ndirection of Fontainebleau, to relieve Paris, November 28, 1870. The\r\nFrench loss was reported by the Germans to be 1000 dead and 4000\r\nwounded, with more than 1700 prisoners. Their own loss was also heavy.\r\n\r\n=Beauvais= (Northern France). The ancient _Bellovaci_, formerly capital\r\nof Picardy. When besieged by Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, with\r\n80,000 men, the women under Jeanne Fourquet or Lainé, also called de la\r\nHachette, from her using that weapon, particularly distinguished\r\nthemselves, and the duke raised the siege, July 10, 1472. In memory of\r\nthis, the women of Beauvais walk first in the procession on the\r\nanniversary of their deliverance.\r\n\r\n=Bebra.= A sort of javelin, used by the ancient Germans; it was an\r\nimitation of the _pilum_ of the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Bec de Corbin= (_Fr._).

They are said to be descendants of Ishmael.\r\n\r\n=Beds.= Are receptacles for ordnance of large calibre,--_mortar-beds_\r\nserve the same purpose as gun-carriages. They are made of solid timber,\r\nconsisting generally of two pieces fastened together with strong iron\r\nbolts and bars. Their sizes depend on the kind of mortar they carry. The\r\nbeds for the smaller mortars are made of one solid block only. The\r\nreason that a bed is used for a mortar instead of a wheel-carriage is on\r\naccount of the high elevation at which a mortar is usually fired, when\r\nthe recoil, instead of forcing the piece backwards, tends to force it\r\ndownwards, and this tendency becomes so great at the higher angles that\r\nno wheel-carriage could long sustain the shock.\r\n\r\n=Beeren, Gross.= A village of Prussia, 11 miles east-southeast of\r\nPotsdam, well known as the scene of a great victory gained by the\r\nPrussians over the French on August 22-23, 1813.\r\n\r\n=Beetles.= In a military sense, are large wooden hammers for driving\r\ndown palisades, and for other uses.\r\n\r\n=Beetlestock.= The stock or handle of a beetle.\r\n\r\n=Befort=, or =Belfort=.

A Turkish title, rather vague in its import, and\r\ncommonly given to superior military officers, ship-captains, and\r\ndistinguished foreigners. More strictly, it applies to the governor of a\r\nsmall district, who bears a horse-tail as a sign of his rank. Beglerbeg,\r\nor more correctly Beilerbegi (“lord of lords”), is the title given to\r\nthe governor of a province who bears three horse-tails as his badge of\r\nhonor, and has authority over several begs, agas, etc.\r\n\r\n=Begkos=, or =Beikos=. A large village of Anatolia, on the Bosphorus, 8\r\nmiles north-northeast of Scutari, said to be the locality of the contest\r\nbetween Pollux and Amycus, in which the latter was killed.

This name was given during\r\nthe Middle Ages, to a combat on horseback, lance in hand; also a tilting\r\nof cavaliers, which took place at public amusements.\r\n\r\n=Beilan.= A town and mountain-pass of Syria at its northern extremity,\r\non the east side of the Gulf of Iskanderoon. Here the Egyptian troops\r\ntotally defeated the Turks in 1882.\r\n\r\n=Belbeys=, or =Belbeis=. A town of Lower Egypt, on the eastern arm of\r\nthe Nile, 28 miles north-northeast of Cairo; it is inclosed by earthen\r\nramparts, and is a station on the route from Egypt to Syria. During the\r\nexpedition of the French into Egypt, Gen. Bonaparte had the ancient\r\nfortifications repaired.\r\n\r\n=Beleaguer.= To invest a town or fortress, so as to preclude escape; to\r\nbesiege; to blockade.\r\n\r\n=Belem.= A town of Portugal, on the right bank of the Tagus, near\r\nLisbon. It is historically interesting as the place from whence Vasco de\r\nGama set sail on his voyage of oriental discovery; it was taken in\r\nNovember, 1807, by the French, the royal family of Portugal embarking\r\nfrom its quay for Brazil as they entered; in 1833, it was occupied by\r\nDon Pedro’s troops.\r\n\r\n=Belemnon.= A dart used by the ancient Grecians.\r\n\r\n=Belfry=, or =Beffroi=. Among military writers of the Middle Ages, a\r\nmovable tower, often several stories high, erected by besiegers for\r\npurposes of attack and defense.\r\n\r\n=Belgian-fuze.= See BORMANN-FUZE.\r\n\r\n=Belgium.= Late the southern portion of the kingdom of the Netherlands,\r\nand anciently the territory of the Belgæ, who were finally conquered by\r\nJulius Cæsar, 51 B.C.; a revolution commenced at Brussels, August 25,\r\n1830; Antwerp taken (except the citadel), December 23, 1830. The king of\r\nthe Netherlands commenced war August 3, 1831, but France sent 50,000\r\ntroops to assist Belgium, which effected an armistice. Antwerp was taken\r\nby the French, December 23, 1832, and the French army returned to France\r\nimmediately after. For previous history, see FLANDERS.\r\n\r\n=Belgrade.= An ancient city in Servia, on the right bank of the Danube.\r\nIt was taken from the Greek emperor by Solomon, king of Hungary, in\r\n1086; gallantly defended by John Huniades, against the Turks under\r\nMahomet II., July to September, 1456, when the latter was defeated with\r\nthe loss of 40,000 men; it was taken by Sultan Solyman, 1521, and\r\nretaken by the Imperialists in 1688, from whom it was again taken by the\r\nTurks, 1690; besieged in May, 1717, by Prince Eugene. On August 5, of\r\nthat year, the Turkish army, 200,000 strong, approached to relieve it,\r\nand a sanguinary battle was fought at Peterwardein, in which the Turks\r\nlost 20,000 men; after this battle Belgrade surrendered. In 1739 it was\r\nceded to the Turks, after its fine fortifications had been demolished;\r\nretaken in 1789, and restored at the peace of Reichenbach in 1790. The\r\nServian insurgents had possession of it in 1806; in 1815, it was placed\r\nunder Prince Milosch, subject to Turkey; the fortifications were\r\nrestored in 1820; the fortress was surrendered by the Turks to the\r\nServians about August, 1867.\r\n\r\n=Belier= (_Fr._).

Here the French under Philip III. were defeated by\r\nPeter III. of Aragon, in 1285; captured by the Spaniards in 1674, and\r\nagain by the French under Marshal Schomberg, in 1675; blockaded and\r\ntaken by the Spaniards under Ricardos, but was retaken by the French in\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\n=Belleisle.= An isle on the southeast of Brittany, France, erected into\r\na duchy for Marshal Belleisle in 1742, in reward of his military and\r\ndiplomatic services, by Louis XV. Belleisle was taken by the British\r\nforces under Commodore Keppel and Gen. Hodgson, after a desperate\r\nresistance, June 7, 1761; restored to France in 1763.\r\n\r\n=Belley=, =Bellica=, =Bellicum=, or =Bellicium=. A town in the\r\ndepartment of Ain, France, 39 miles east from Lyons, formerly fortified.\r\nBelley served as a place of arms to Cæsar against the Allobroges; burned\r\nby Alaric in 390; it was in the possession of the dukes of Savoy; it was\r\nceded to France in 1601.\r\n\r\n=Belligerent.= In a state of warfare.

The Prussians, under Colonel Count von\r\nWartensleben, attempted to surprise it in 1793, but failed.\r\n\r\n=Bithynia.= An ancient division of Asia Minor, separated from Europe by\r\nthe Propontus (Sea of Marmora) and the Thracian Bosphorus (Strait of\r\nConstantinople). It contained the famous Greek cities or colonies of\r\nChalcedon, Heraclea, etc., and at later periods, Nicomedia, Nicæa, and\r\nPrusa. The inhabitants were supposed to be of Thracian origin. The\r\ncountry is said to have been subdued by Crœsus of Lydia (560 B.C.), and\r\nfive years later fell under the Persian dominion. About 440 or 430 B.C.\r\nit became an independent kingdom, under a dynasty of native princes, who\r\nmade Nicomedia their capital. It afterwards fell into the hands of the\r\nRomans, and was governed as a province. In 1298, Osman the Turk broke\r\ninto the country, and in 1328 Prusa, or Brusa, then its chief town,\r\nbecame the capital of the kingdom of the Osmanli.\r\n\r\n=Bitonto.= A town of Naples where Mortemar and the Spaniards defeated\r\nthe Germans, on May 26, 1734, and eventually gained the kingdom of the\r\nTwo Sicilies for Don Carlos.\r\n\r\n=Biturritæ= (now _Bedarrides_). In the department of Vaucluse, France.\r\nIt was a city of the Allobroges, who were totally defeated in its\r\nenvirons by Domitius Ahenobarbus in 122 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Bivouac.= A night-watch in open air. Troops bivouac when they make the\r\nbest of it for the night, encamping in the open air. The term was also\r\napplied to a night-guard of the whole army, when apprehensive of\r\nsurprise. The word comes from the German bei, “near,” and wache,\r\n“watch.” In recent times it is common for soldiers on the march to use\r\nthe _tente d’abri_, or shelter-tent.\r\n\r\n=Bizerta=, or =Benzerta=. The most northern town of Africa, and a\r\nfortified seaport of Tunis. It is defended by two castles, which,\r\nhowever, are commanded by adjacent heights. Though its port now only\r\nadmits small vessels, it was formerly one of the best in the\r\nMediterranean. This city was noted for the piracy of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n=Black.= In blazonry, sable denotes constancy, wisdom, and prudence.\r\n\r\n=Black-book.= An ancient book of English admiralty law, compiled in the\r\nreign of Edward III. It has always been deemed of the highest authority\r\nin matters concerning the admiralty in England.\r\n\r\n=Blackfeet.= A once powerful and ferocious tribe of American Indians of\r\nAlgonkin stock, who infest the country between the Yellowstone and\r\nMissouri Rivers, and are also found in British America. See INDIANS AND\r\nTHEIR AGENCIES.\r\n\r\n=Blackheath= (Kent, near London). Here Wat Tyler and his followers\r\nassembled, June 12, 1381, and here also Jack Cade and his 20,000 Kentish\r\nmen encamped, June 1, 1450. Here the Cornish rebels were defeated and\r\nFlannock’s insurrection quelled, June 22, 1497. The cavern on the ascent\r\nto Blackheath, the retreat of Cade and the haunt of banditti in the time\r\nof Cromwell, was rediscovered in 1780.\r\n\r\n=Black Hole.= The appellation familiarly given in England to the dungeon\r\nor dark cell of a prison. The name is associated with a horrible\r\ncatastrophe in the history of British India, namely, the cruel\r\nconfinement of a party of English in an apartment called the “Black Hole\r\nof Calcutta,” on the night of June 19, 1756. The garrison of a fort at\r\nCalcutta having been captured by the nabob Surajah Dowlah, he caused the\r\nwhole of the prisoners taken, 146 in number, to be confined in an\r\napartment 20 feet square, having only two small windows, which were\r\nobstructed by a veranda. After a night of excruciating agony from heat,\r\nthirst, and want of air, there remained in the morning but 23\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\n=Black Rod, Usher of the.= An officer of the English House of Lords,\r\nwhose emblem of authority is the wand or rod, with a gold lion on top.\r\nHe belongs to the order of the Garter, and keeps the door when the\r\nchapter of that order is in session. His principal duty is to summon the\r\nCommons to the House of Lords when royal assent is given to bills, etc.,\r\nand to take into custody any peer guilty of breach of privilege.\r\n\r\n=Black Sea=, or =Euxine=. _Pontus Euxinus_ of the ancients; a large\r\ninternal sea between the southwest provinces of Russia and Asia Minor,\r\nconnected with the Sea of Azof by the Straits of Yenikalé and with the\r\nSea of Marmora by the Bosphorus. This sea was much frequented by the\r\nGreeks and Italians till it was closed to all nations by the Turks after\r\nthe fall of Constantinople, in 1453. The Russians obtained admission by\r\nthe treaty of Kainavdji, July 10, 1774. In 1779 it was partially opened\r\nto British and other traders, since which time the Russians gradually\r\nobtained the preponderance. It was entered by the British and French\r\nfleets, January 3, 1854. A dreadful storm in this sea raged from\r\nNovember 13 to 16, 1854, and caused great loss of life and shipping, and\r\nvaluable stores for the allied armies. By the treaty of 1856 the Black\r\nSea was opened to the commerce of all nations, the Russians and Turks\r\nnot being allowed to keep ships of war on it. In 1871 the Russians were\r\nagain permitted to have men-of-war on this sea.\r\n\r\n=Black Watch.= Armed companies of the loyal clans (Campbells, Munros,\r\netc.) employed to watch the Highlands from about 1725 to 1739, when they\r\nwere formed into the celebrated 42d Regiment, which was formerly\r\nenrolled “The Royal Highland Black Watch.” Their removal probably\r\nfacilitated the outbreak of 1745. They wore dark tartans, and hence\r\ntheir name.\r\n\r\n=Blackwater, Battle of.= In Ireland, August 14, 1598, when the Irish\r\nchief O’Neal defeated the English under Sir Henry Bagnall. Pope Clement\r\nVIII. sent O’Neal a consecrated plume, and granted to his followers the\r\nsame indulgences as to Crusaders.\r\n\r\n=Bladensburg.= A village of Prince George Co., Md., memorable for the\r\nbattle which was fought here August 24, 1814, between the British and\r\nAmericans, and which resulted in the capture of Washington.\r\n\r\n=Blair-Athol.= A village in Perthshire, Scotland; it was occupied by the\r\nMarquis of Montrose in 1644; stormed by a party under the command of one\r\nof Cromwell’s officers in 1653; and gallantly defended by Sir Andrew\r\nAgnew, in 1746, when besieged by a portion of the Highland army, until\r\nhe was relieved by the Hessians under the Earl of Crawford. The pass of\r\nKillekrankie, about two miles from Blair Castle, is famous for the\r\nbattle which was there fought in 1689, between the Highlanders under\r\nViscount Dundee, and King William’s troops under Gen. Mackay.\r\n\r\n=Blaise.= A military order instituted by the kings of Armenia, in honor\r\nof St. Blaise the Martyr, anciently bishop of Sebasta, and the patron\r\nsaint of Armenia. Justinian calls them Knights of St. Blaise and St.\r\nMary, and places them not only in Armenia, but in Palestine. They made a\r\nvow to defend the Church of Rome, and followed the rule of St. Basil.\r\nThis institution appears to have commenced about the same time with the\r\nKnights Templar and Hospitallers.\r\n\r\n=Blakely Gun.= See ORDNANCE, BUILT-UP GUNS.\r\n\r\n=Blakely Projectiles.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Blamont.= A small town of France, department of Doubs. This small place\r\nwas protected by an ancient fortress, which was ruined by the allies in\r\n1814.\r\n\r\n=Blanch-Lyon.= A title of one of the English pursuivants-at-arms. See\r\nPURSUIVANT.\r\n\r\n=Blank.= The point of a target at which aim is taken, marked with a\r\nwhite spot; hence, the object to which anything is directed.\r\n\r\n=Blank Cartridge.= See CARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n=Blanket-boats.= A practical and highly useful plan for crossing streams\r\nis by means of boats constructed of a single rubber blanket, capable of\r\ncarrying a soldier, knapsack, arms, and accoutrements, with only 4\r\ninches of displacement. The size of some of the ordinary blankets is 6\r\nfeet long and 4 feet 9 inches wide; but 7 feet by 5 feet would be\r\npreferable. If the height of the boat be made 1 foot, the length will be\r\n4 feet, and the width 2 feet 9 inches, so as to be completely covered by\r\nthe blanket. The frame may be made of round sticks, 1 inch and 1¹⁄₂ inch\r\nin diameter, in the following manner:\r\n\r\nFor the bottom the two end-sticks are 2 feet 9 inches long, and the\r\nside-pieces 3 feet 9 inches long. They are connected by boring a\r\n¹⁄₂-inch hole through the end-pieces, and into the ends of the\r\nside-pieces, into which pins are driven. The top is formed in the same\r\nmanner, and both top and bottom of 1¹⁄₂-inch sticks. The side-pieces of\r\nthe bottom, and the top and bottom frames are connected by 1-inch round\r\nsticks inserted in ¹⁄₂-inch holes, in the same manner as the upright\r\npieces are fastened in a chair. To keep the frame from falling apart,\r\nloops of cord are passed from top to bottom, and from side to side, and\r\ntwisted with a stick. The rubber blanket is then spread upon the ground,\r\nthe frame placed upon it, the sides and eyes turned up and lashed to the\r\ntop rail by twine passed through the eyelets. Loops of cord are passed\r\nover these projecting ends, and twisted with a stick, which binds the\r\nparts together. One of these boats having a horizontal area of 11 square\r\nfeet, would require 687 pounds to sink it 1 foot, and the average weight\r\nof a man would displace less than 4 inches.\r\n\r\nIn using these blanket-boats it will be convenient to lash several\r\ntogether, side by side, upon which soldiers can be transported. The\r\nfloat can be paddled or a rope may be stretched across, supported by\r\nfloats, and the men can pull themselves across. If used for cavalry,\r\nsome of the men can hold the bridles of the horses, while the others can\r\npull, paddle, or pole across the stream, the saddles being placed in the\r\nboats. The frames are abandoned, or used for fuel, when the army has\r\ncrossed over.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these boats lashed together, and covered with poles, would\r\nform a raft on which wagons could be carried over; but for artillery,\r\nrafts of wagon-bodies, or something possessing greater powers of\r\nflotation, should be employed. The bill of materials for the frame of a\r\nblanket-boat is: 4 end-pieces, 1¹⁄₂ inches round or square, 2 feet 9\r\ninches long; 4 side-pieces, 1¹⁄₂ inches round or square, 3 feet 9 inches\r\nlong; 30 uprights, 1 inch round or square, 1 foot long; 10 pieces across\r\nbottom, 1 inch round or square, 2 feet 9 inches long; 8 double pins,\r\n¹⁄₂-inch in diameter, 3 inches long; 4 pieces of cord or strong twine,\r\neach 9 feet long; 6 pieces of cord or strong twine, each 3 feet long; 1\r\nindia-rubber blanket, 6 feet long, 4 feet 9 inches wide, with eyelet\r\nholes around all sides, not more than 6 inches apart, and 30 feet of\r\ntwine to lash the blanket to the frame.\r\n\r\n=Blanketeers.= A number of operators who, on March 30, 1817, met in St.\r\nPeter’s Field, near Manchester, England, many of them having blankets,\r\nrugs, or great-coats rolled up and fastened to their backs. This was\r\ntermed the “blanket meeting.” They proceeded to march towards London,\r\nbut were dispersed by the magistracy. It is stated that their object was\r\nto commence a general insurrection. Eventually the ringleaders had an\r\ninterview with the cabinet ministers, and a better understanding between\r\nthe working-classes and the government ensued.\r\n\r\n=Blasting.= The displacement of earth or rock by the use of an\r\nexplosive. One of the most important parts of the art of mining in its\r\nvarious branches of _tunneling_, _shaft-boring_, _well-digging_,\r\nsubmarine _mining_, etc. The explosive is ordinarily placed in a bore\r\nhole, but in submarine mining this is sometimes dispensed with when a\r\nhigh explosive like nitro-glycerine is used.\r\n\r\n=Blasting Powder.= An explosive in the form of powder used for blasting.\r\nThe most powerful blasting powders in common use are made by adding\r\ncertain substances to nitro-glycerine, which, by absorbing it, reduce it\r\nto the form of powder, and thus render it comparatively safe against the\r\nshocks and jars of use. (See GIANT POWDER, DYNAMITE.) The term blasting\r\npowder is also specially applied to a powder analogous to gunpowder, but\r\nwhich contains sodium nitrate in place of potassium nitrate, or\r\nsaltpetre.\r\n\r\n=Blaubeuren.= A town of Würtemberg, on the Blau; here the French\r\ndefeated the Austrians in 1800; the fortress was razed in 1806.\r\n\r\n=Blayle= (anc. _Blavia_). A fortified seaport of France, in the\r\ndepartment of Gironde, 20 miles north-northwest of Bordeaux. The Duchess\r\nde Berry was imprisoned in the citadel in 1833. This city was captured\r\nby the French, from the English, in 1339; the Protestants took\r\npossession of it in 1568, and the English tried in vain to take it in\r\n1814.\r\n\r\n=Blazonry= (from the German _Blasen_, “to blow”). The art of describing\r\nin technical language the objects or charges borne in a coat of arms,\r\nand the manner of arranging them on a shield. The term originated from\r\nthe custom of blowing a trumpet to announce the arrival of a knight, or\r\nhis entrance into the lists at a joust or tournament. The blast was\r\nanswered by the heralds, who described aloud and explained the arms\r\nborne by the knight.\r\n\r\n=Blechstreifen=, or =Blechschienen= (_Ger._) (_Les laisches_, Fr.). Thin\r\nmetal plates which the ancient Gauls placed upon the buff coats of\r\ninfantry; they were placed between the buff and the lining.\r\n\r\n=Bleneau.= A village of France, in the department of the Yonne, about 29\r\nmiles west-southwest of Auxerre, celebrated as the place where Turenne\r\ngained a victory over the Prince of Condé in 1652.\r\n\r\n=Blenheim= (Ger. _Blindheim_). A village of Bavaria, 23 miles\r\nnorth-northwest of Augsburg, memorable in connection with Marlborough’s\r\ngreat victory over the French and Bavarians, August 13, 1704. The\r\nbattle, though known in English history by the name of “Blenheim,” did\r\nnot occur here, but at the neighboring village of Hochstädt, by which\r\nname it is known to the French and Germans. The French and Bavarian army\r\nconsisted of 56,000 men, commanded by Tallard, Marsin, and the Elector\r\nof Bavaria, and opposed to it was the allied army 52,000 strong,\r\ncommanded by the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene. The loss of the\r\nFrench and Bavarians was estimated at from 30,000 to 40,000. Near here,\r\nalso, in 1800, the French defeated the Austrians.\r\n\r\n=Bleus, Les= (_i.e._ “The Blues”). A name given to the soldiers of the\r\nRepublic, by the Royalists, during the wars of La Vendée, on account of\r\ntheir uniform.\r\n\r\n=Blidah.= A considerable town of Algeria, on the border of the Metidjah\r\nPlain; taken by the French in 1830, and permanently occupied by them\r\nsince 1838.\r\n\r\n=Blieskastel.= A small town of Rhenish Bavaria; near here, on November\r\n19, 1793, 7000 Prussians and Saxons under Gen. Kalkreuth fought the\r\nFrench, about 20,000 strong, under Gen. Hoche, neither side gaining the\r\nvictory. The Prussians held their ground without any great loss until\r\ndark, when, deeming their position untenable, they evacuated it during\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n=Blindage.= A temporary bomb-proof or splinter-proof roofing,\r\nconstructed of timber and the like, to give cover to magazines,\r\nbatteries, hospitals, etc. See BLINDS.\r\n\r\n=Blinds.= In military affairs, are wooden frames, composed of four\r\npieces, either flat or round, two of which are 6 feet long, and the\r\nothers 3 or 4 feet, which serve as spars to fasten the two first\r\ntogether: the longest are pointed at both ends, and the two others are\r\nfastened towards the extremities of the former, at about 10 or 12\r\ninches. Their use is to fix them either upright, or in a vertical\r\nposition against the sides of the trenches or sap, to sustain the earth.\r\nTheir points at the bottom serve to fix them in the earth, and those at\r\nthe top to hold the fascines that are placed upon them; so that the sap\r\nor trench is formed into a kind of covered gallery, to secure the troops\r\nfrom stones and grenades.\r\n\r\n=Blind-shell.= A shell, the bursting charge of which is exploded by the\r\nheat of impact. Used in modern ordnance against armor.\r\n\r\n=Blistered Steel.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR.\r\n\r\n=Block.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Blockade.= In military art, is an operation for capturing an enemy’s\r\ntown or fortress without a bombardment or regular siege. The attacking\r\nparty throws up works on the neighboring heights and roads, and part of\r\nthe besieging force remains under cover in villages, or in a temporary\r\ncamp, ready to repel any sortie attempted by the besieged. The whole\r\npurpose in view is to prevent the besieged from receiving supplies of\r\nany kind, in order that, when food or ammunition is exhausted, they may\r\nbe compelled to surrender. Fortresses situated on steep and rocky\r\neminences, difficult to conquer by bombardment or assault, may often be\r\nreduced by blockade, because the roads or paths for the reception of\r\nsupplies are few, and can be guarded by a small number of troops.\r\n\r\n=Blockade.= In international law, is the means in time of war of\r\nrendering intercourse with an enemy’s port unlawful on the part of\r\nneutrals; and it is carried into effect by an armed force (ships of\r\nwar), which blocks up and bars export or import to or from the place\r\nblockaded. To be valid, a blockade must be accompanied by actual\r\ninvestment of the place, and it may be more or less rigorous, either for\r\nthe purpose of watching the operations of the enemy, or to cut off all\r\nexcess of neutral vessels to that interdicted place. To be binding on\r\nneutrals, it ought to be shown that they have knowledge, or may be\r\npresumed to know of the blockade, for which reason a formal notification\r\nof the fact is usually made by the blockading power. The breach of\r\nblockade, which may be effected by coming out of a blockaded port, or\r\ngoing in, subjects the property so employed to confiscation. On the\r\nproclamation of peace, or from any political or belligerent cause, the\r\ncontinuance of the investment may cease to be necessary, and the\r\nblockade is then said to be _raised_. The blockading force then\r\nretires, and the port is open as before to all other nations. In the\r\npresent century recourse has been had to this means of cutting off\r\nsupplies from the enemy on several occasions. The Elbe was blockaded by\r\nGreat Britain, 1803; the Baltic, by Denmark, 1848-49 and 1864; the Gulf\r\nof Finland by the allies, 1854; and the ports of the Southern States by\r\nPresident Lincoln, April 19, 1861.\r\n\r\n=Blockader.= One who blockades.\r\n\r\n=Block Battery.= In gunnery, a wooden battery for two or more small\r\npieces, mounted on wheels, and movable from place to place; very ready\r\nto fire _en barbette_, in the galleries and casements, etc., where room\r\nis wanted.\r\n\r\n=Block-house.= An edifice or structure of heavy timber or logs for\r\nmilitary defense, having its sides loop-holed for musketry, and often an\r\nupper story projecting over the lower, or placed upon it diagonally,\r\nwith projecting corners, to facilitate a firing downward, and in all\r\ndirections; the sides and ends are sometimes much like a stockade, and\r\nthe top covered with earth; there may also be a ditch around it.\r\nFormerly much used in Germany and America, and used extensively in the\r\nUnited States as a defense against Indians, and during the civil war,\r\n1861-65, for the protection of important places on railroads, such as\r\nbridges, etc. If exposed to the fire of artillery, block-houses should\r\nbe formed of double rows of logs 3 feet apart, with well-rammed earth\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n=Bloodhound.= A name given to certain species of the dog, distinguished\r\nfor their keenness of scent, and the persistency with which they follow\r\nthe track of game. They have been frequently employed during wars to\r\ntrack partisans, and even in the American civil war, 1861-65, were\r\nemployed by the Confederates to track Union prisoners who escaped from\r\ntheir prisons. In time of peace they are sometimes employed to hunt\r\nfelons, fugitive slaves, etc. When they are thus employed they acquire a\r\npeculiarly bloodthirsty and ferocious character.\r\n\r\n=Bloreheath.= In Staffordshire, England; here on September 23, 1459, the\r\nEarl of Salisbury and the Yorkists defeated the Lancastrians, whose\r\nleader, Lord Audley, was slain with many Cheshire gentlemen. A cross\r\ncommemorates this conflict.\r\n\r\n=Bludgeon.= A short stick, with one end loaded, or thicker and heavier\r\nthan the other, used as an offensive weapon.\r\n\r\n=Blue-light.= A composition, burning with a blue flame, used as a night\r\nsignal in ships, or for military purposes. See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Blunderbuss.= A short gun or fire-arm, with a large bore, capable of\r\nholding a number of balls, and intended to do execution without exact\r\naim.\r\n\r\n=Blyde=, =Bly=, or =Blude= (_Ger._). A kind of a war machine which was\r\nused in ancient times to throw stones; some authors compare it to the\r\ncatapult. In the year 1585, at the siege of the castle of Rucklingen,\r\nAlbert, duke of Saxony and Lüneburg, was killed by a stone thrown by a\r\nblyde.\r\n\r\n=Board of Officers.= A number of officers assembled by military\r\nauthority for the transaction of business.\r\n\r\n=Board of Ordnance.= A government department, which formerly had the\r\nmanagement of all affairs relating to the artillery and engineering\r\ncorps of the British army. This board was abolished after the Crimean\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n=Board, Pointing.= In gunnery, this is a piece of wood 1 foot long, 2 or\r\n3 inches wide, and 1 inch thick, having a notch cut in the middle of one\r\nside to fit on the stake, and graduated into equal divisions from its\r\nmiddle. When not in use the pointing cord may be wound on it. This board\r\nis used for directing mortars.\r\n\r\n=Boards of Examination.= In the army, are instituted to determine upon\r\nappointments in regiments, and for appointments and promotion in the\r\nmedical staff, engineer corps, and ordnance department. They are\r\ncomposed of army officers.\r\n\r\n=Boards of Survey.= In the army, are convened for the purpose of fixing\r\nthe responsibility for public property lost, damaged, or destroyed, of\r\nascertaining what articles of public property may have been lost or\r\nabstracted whenever a soldier deserts, and of taking an inventory of the\r\npublic property in charge of a deceased officer.\r\n\r\n=Boats, Blanket-.= See BLANKET-BOATS.\r\n\r\n=Bobruisk.= A fortified town of Russia, in the government of Minsk. It\r\nis situated on the right bank of the Beresina, and is a station for the\r\nsteam-packets navigating the Dnieper and Beresina. It was besieged\r\nineffectually by the French in 1812.\r\n\r\n=Boccacci.= The Italians have a peculiar kind of fire-arm which they\r\ncall by this name; it is enlarged towards the muzzle in the shape of a\r\ntrumpet. This gun is principally used by the Calabrians.\r\n\r\n=Bocchetta.= A celebrated pass of the Apennines, the key of the route\r\nfrom Novi to Genoa. Redoubts were constructed here by the Imperialists\r\nin 1746 for the defense of the pass. The French traversed this pass when\r\nthey entered Italy in 1796.\r\n\r\n=Bodegraven.= A fortified town of Holland. On November 28, 1672, it was\r\ncaptured by the Duke of Luxemburg, who tarnished his victory by\r\nauthorizing the town to be pillaged.\r\n\r\n=Bodkin.= A dirk or dagger; a word still in use, though Johnson says it\r\nis the oldest acceptation of it.\r\n\r\n=Body.= In the nomenclature of modern ordnance, is the part of the piece\r\nin rear of the trunnions.\r\n\r\n=Body.= In the art of war, is a number of forces, horse or foot, united\r\nand marching under one commander. _Main_ body of _an army_, sometimes\r\nmeans the troops encamped in the centre between the two wings, and\r\ngenerally consists of infantry. The main body on a march, signifies the\r\nwhole of the army exclusive of the van- and rear-guards.\r\n\r\n=Body of the Place.= The _enceinte_ of a fortress, or main line of\r\nbastions and curtains, as distinguished from outworks.\r\n\r\n=Body-guard.= A guard to protect or defend the person; a life-guard.\r\n\r\n=Bœotia.= One of the political divisions of ancient Greece, lying\r\nbetween Attica and Megaris on the south, and Locris and Phocis on the\r\nnorth, and bounded on the other side by the Eubœan Sea and the\r\nCorinthian Gulf. The tribes of greatest importance who appear as rulers\r\nof Bœotia in the heroic age were the Minyæ and the Cadmeans, or\r\nCadmeones,--the former dwelling at Orchomenus, and the latter at Thebes.\r\nAbout 60 years after the Trojan war the Bœotians, an Æolian people who\r\nhad hitherto dwelt in Thessaly, having been expelled from that country,\r\ntook possession of the land then called Cadmeis, to which they gave\r\ntheir own name of Bœotia. At the commencement of the historic period all\r\nthe ancient tribes had disappeared, and all the cities were inhabited by\r\nBœotians, the most important forming a political confederacy under the\r\npresidency of Thebes. After the battle of Chæronea (338 B.C.) and the\r\ndestruction of Thebes by Alexander three years after, Bœotia rapidly\r\ndeclined, and so low had it sunk in the time of the Romans, that of all\r\nits great cities there remained only two, which had dwindled into\r\ninsignificant towns; of the other great cities nothing remained but\r\ntheir ruins and their names.

About the middle of the 6th century a numerous army of\r\nCzechs entered the country and subdued it. In 1310 the crown came to the\r\nhouse of Luxemburg, when Charles IV. united Bohemia with the German\r\nempire. After many vicissitudes it fell to the house of Austria in the\r\nperson of the Archduke Ferdinand, brother of Charles V., and\r\nbrother-in-law of Louis II., king of Hungary and Bohemia, who was killed\r\nin battle with the Turks near Mohacs, in 1526. In 1619 the Bohemians\r\nrevolted against the house of Austria, and offered the crown to\r\nFrederick V., elector palatine, but Frederick was defeated at the battle\r\nof White Mountain in November, 1620, and the country has ever since\r\nremained under the sway of the emperors of Austria.\r\n\r\n=Bohmisch-Brod.= A small town of Bohemia.

Passing out of their\r\nhands, it was retaken by them in 305 B.C., and once more reverting to\r\nits original owners, was a third time captured by the Romans in 298 B.C.\r\nDuring the second Punic war it formed the headquarters of the Roman army\r\non more than one occasion. In the great Social war the confederates made\r\nit their capital. It was surprised by Sulla, and retaken by the Marsic\r\ngeneral, Pompædius Silo. Cæsar established a military colony, and it\r\nafterwards throve under the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n=Bojeleschti.= A village of Wallachia, where, in 1828, the Russians\r\nunder Gen. von Geismar defeated the Turks, although the latter were\r\nsuperior in force.

The\r\nBritish envoys, Col. Stoddart and Capt. Conolly, were murdered at\r\nBokhara, the capital, by the khan in 1843. In the war with Russia,\r\nbeginning in 1866, the emir’s army was defeated several times in May and\r\nsubsequent months during that year. Peace was made July 11, 1867.

In some foreign armies, the bombardiers form a separate\r\ncorps. In the British service a bombardier is a non-commissioned grade\r\nin the artillery below that of corporal.\r\n\r\n=Bombardment.= Is an attack upon a fortress or fortified town by means\r\nof shells, red-hot shot, carcasses, rockets, etc., to burn and destroy\r\nthe buildings, and kill the inhabitants, and by this means compel its\r\nsurrender. A bombardment requires little engineering skill; whereas a\r\nregular siege requires the aid of engineers to direct the attack against\r\nfortifications, guns, and soldiery, leaving the inhabitants and\r\nbuildings untouched. It is generally regarded by military engineers as a\r\ncruel operation, and in modern times is mostly adopted as an adjunct to\r\na siege. The stores required for a vigorous bombardment are immense.\r\nThus, in 1759, Rodney threw 20,000 shells and carcasses into Havre; in\r\n1792, the Duke of Saxe Teschen threw 36,000 shot and shell into Lille in\r\n140 hours; in 1795, Pichegru threw 8000 shells into Mannheim in 16\r\nhours; and in 1807, the English threw 11,000 shot and shell into\r\nCopenhagen in three days.

Scott for three days before its\r\nsurrender, March 27, 1847. During the civil war recourse was had several\r\ntimes to this method of reducing fortified places. Among the most noted\r\nwere the bombardment by Admiral Farragut for six days, April 18, 1862,\r\nof Forts Jackson and St. Philip (after which they surrendered); the\r\nbombardment of Fort Pulaski, Ga., by Gen. Gillmore, in April, 1862; the\r\nfirst bombardment of Fort Sumter in August, 1863, which effectually\r\ndisabled the fort for immediate defense of Charleston harbor, although\r\nthe works remained in the possession of the Confederates; and the second\r\nbombardment, which took place in October following, leaving the place in\r\nruins. During the Franco-German war Strasburg was bombarded by the\r\nPrussians on August 18, 1870, and after an immense number of shells were\r\nthrown into it with ruinous effect the city surrendered on September 27.\r\nDuring the siege of Paris it was estimated that for two weeks in\r\nJanuary, 1871, about 500 shells a day were thrown into the city, to the\r\ngreat destruction of life and property.\r\n\r\n=Bomb-chest.= A chest filled with bombs, or only with gunpowder, placed\r\nunder ground, to cause destruction by its explosion.\r\n\r\n=Bomb-proof.= A term applied to military structures of such immense\r\nthickness and strength that bombs cannot penetrate them.\r\n\r\n=Bomb-shell.= A hollow globe of iron, filled with powder, and thrown\r\nfrom a mortar; a bomb.\r\n\r\n=Bone=, =Bona=, or =Bonah=.

When\r\nthrown from the hand with a quick rotary motion, it describes very\r\nremarkable curves, according to the shape of the instrument and the\r\nmanner of throwing it, often moving nearly horizontally a long distance,\r\nthen curving upward to a considerable height, and finally taking a\r\nretrograde direction, so as to fall near the place from which it was\r\nthrown, or even very far in the rear of it.\r\n\r\n=Booneville.= A river-port, capital of Cooper Co., Mo., situated on the\r\nright bank of the Missouri River, 48 miles northwest of Jefferson City.\r\nDuring the civil war a Confederate force of about 2500 raw troops was\r\nhere attacked by the Federals under Gen.

It came into the\r\npossession of the Duke of Gascoyne in 911; in 1653 the city rebelled,\r\nbut was taken by the royal troops; Bordeaux was entered by the\r\nvictorious British army after the battle of Orthes, fought February 27,\r\n1814.\r\n\r\n=Bordure=, or =Border=. In heraldry, coats of arms are frequently\r\nsurrounded with a bordure, the object of which is to show that the\r\nbearer is a cadet of the house whose arms he carries. Its character\r\noften has reference to the profession of the bearer; thus a _bordure\r\nembattled_ is granted to a soldier, and a _bordure ermine_ to a lawyer.\r\n\r\n=Bore.= Of a piece of ordnance includes all the part bored out, viz.,\r\nthe cylinder, the chamber (if there is one), and the conical or\r\nspherical surface connecting them.\r\n\r\n=Borghetto.= A town of Italy, on the Mincio, 15 miles southwest of\r\nVerona; it has a castle and a vast fortified causeway.

The\r\nfuze-case is made of metal (a composition of lead and tin), and consists\r\nof a short cylinder, having at one end a horseshoe-shaped indentation,\r\n_one_ end only of which communicates with the magazine of the fuze\r\nplaced in the centre by a channel filled with _rifle_ powder. This\r\nhorseshoe indentation extends nearly to the other end of the cylinder, a\r\nthin layer of the metal only intervening. This is graduated on the\r\noutside into equal parts representing seconds and quarter-seconds. In\r\nthe bottom of this channel a smooth layer of the composition is placed,\r\nwith a piece of wick or yarn underneath it. On this is placed a piece of\r\nmetal, the cross-section of which is wedge-shaped, and this, by\r\nmachinery, is pressed down upon the composition, sealing it\r\nhermetically. The cylindrical opening is filled with musket powder and\r\ncovered with a sheet of tin, which is soldered, closing the magazine\r\nfrom the external air. Before using the fuze several holes are punched\r\nthrough this sheet of tin, to allow the flame to enter the shell. On the\r\nside of the fuze the thread of a screw is cut which fits into one cut on\r\nthe inside of the fuze-hole, and the fuze is screwed into the shell with\r\na wrench. The thin layer of metal over the composition is cut through\r\nwith a gouge or chisel, or even a penknife, at the interval marked with\r\nthe number of seconds which we wish the fuze to burn. To prevent the\r\nmetal of this fuze, which is soft, from being driven into the shell by\r\nthe explosive force of the charge, a circular piece of iron, with a hole\r\nthrough its centre, and the thread of a screw on the outside, is screwed\r\ninto the fuze-hole before the fuze is inserted. The most important\r\nadvantage of this fuze is, that the shells can be loaded, all ready for\r\nuse, and remain so any length of time, perfectly safe from explosion, as\r\nthe fuze can be screwed into its place, and the composition never\r\nexposed to external fire until the metal is cut through.\r\n\r\n=Borneo.= An island in the Indian Ocean, the largest in the world except\r\nAustralia; discovered by the Portuguese about 1520; the pirates of this\r\nisland were several times chastised by the British government;\r\nincorporated with the British empire, December 2, 1846.\r\n\r\n=Bornhoevede.= A village of Holstein, where a battle was fought on July\r\n22, 1227, between Woldemar II., king of Denmark, and Adolphus IV. of\r\nHolstein; the Danes were totally defeated.\r\n\r\n=Borodino.= A Russian village on the Moskwa, near which a sanguinary\r\nbattle was fought, September 7, 1812, between the French under Napoleon,\r\nand the Russians under Kootoosof, 240,000 men being engaged.

Boston seaport was shut by the\r\nEnglish Parliament, until restitution should be made to the East India\r\nCompany for the tea lost, March 25, 1774. The town was besieged by the\r\nBritish next year, and 400 houses were destroyed. A battle between the\r\nroyalist and independent troops, in which the latter were defeated, took\r\nplace June 17, 1775; the city was evacuated by the king’s troops, April,\r\n1776. The inhabitants were very zealous against slavery in 1861.\r\n\r\n=Boston Massacre.= A name popularly given to a disturbance which\r\noccurred in the streets of Boston on the evening of March 5, 1770, when\r\na sergeant’s guard belonging to the British garrison fired upon a crowd\r\nof people who were surrounding them and pelting them with snowballs, and\r\nkilled 3 men besides wounding several others.

Sir Sidney\r\nSmith unsuccessfully attempted to burn the flotilla with fire-machines\r\ncalled catamarans, October 2, 1804. Congreve rockets were used in\r\nanother attack, and they set the town on fire, October 8, 1806. The army\r\nwas removed on the breaking out of the war with Austria in 1805. Louis\r\nNapoleon, afterwards emperor, made a descent here with about 50\r\nfollowers, August 6, 1840, without success.\r\n\r\n=Bounty.= A premium offered or given to induce men to enlist into the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\n=Bourbon, Isle of= (in the Indian Ocean). Discovered by the Portuguese\r\nabout 1545. The French here formed a colony in 1653 (according to\r\nothers, 1642, 1646, 1649). In 1810, after a gallant resistance, it fell\r\ninto the hands of the British, who retained it till the general peace,\r\n1814. In 1815, before the downfall of Napoleon, it was once more\r\nbesieged by the English, and along with the Mauritius again fell into\r\ntheir hands. After the general pacification of Europe, Bourbon was\r\nrestored to France, in whose possession it now is; but the adjoining\r\nisland has since been retained by its English conquerors.\r\n\r\n=Bourdonnante= (_Fr._).

The French having seized Portugal in 1807,\r\nthe royal family and nobles embarked for Brazil, and landed March 7,\r\n1808. Brazil declared war against Uruguay in February, 1865; entered\r\ninto a treaty with Uruguay and the Argentine Republic against Paraguay,\r\ngoverned by Lopez, in May, 1865, and war was waged with varying results\r\nup to 1870.\r\n\r\n=Breach.= Rupture made in a fortification to facilitate the assault. The\r\noperation by which the opening is produced is called _breaching_, and\r\nthe guns used for this purpose are _breaching batteries_. _To repair a\r\nbreach_, is to stop or fill up the gap with gabions, fascines, etc., and\r\nprevent the assault. _To fortify a breach_, is to render it inaccessible\r\nby means of chevaux-de-frise, crow’s feet, etc. _To make a lodgment in\r\nthe breach._ After the besieged are driven away, the besiegers secure\r\nthemselves against any future attack in the breach. _To clear the\r\nbreach_, that is, to remove the ruins, that it may be better defended.\r\n\r\n=Breach of Arrest.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 65.\r\n\r\n=Bread and Water.= A diet used as a military punishment.\r\n\r\n=Break Ground.= Is to commence the siege of a place by opening trenches,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Breast-height.= In fortification, the interior slope of a parapet.\r\n\r\n=Breastplate.= A plate worn upon the breast as a part of defensive\r\narmor.\r\n\r\n=Breastwork.= In fortification, a defensive work breast-high, hastily\r\nthrown up, of earth or other material.\r\n\r\n=Brechin.= A place in Scotland; sustained a siege against the army of\r\nEdward III., 1333.

The _base of the breech_ is its\r\nrear surface.\r\n\r\n=Breech-block.= The block of metal which closes the bore in\r\nbreech-loading arms.\r\n\r\n=Breech-loader.= A fire-arm that receives its load at the breech.\r\n\r\n=Breech-loading.= Receiving the charge at the breech instead of the\r\nmuzzle. A feature of modern small-arms. The principle, however, is very\r\nold, as some of the earliest guns were breech-loaders. A gun of the time\r\nof Henry VIII. still extant is substantially the same as the modern\r\n_Snider_. Puckle’s revolver of 1718 was mounted on a tripod, and was\r\nvery much like the _Gatling gun_ in its general features. The first\r\nAmerican patent was to Thornton & Hall, of Massachusetts, 1811. These\r\nguns were extensively issued to U. S. troops. There is a specimen in the\r\nWest Point Museum. Prior to 1861 the best known breech-loading\r\nsmall-arms were _Sharps’_, _Burnside’s_, _Maynard’s_, _Merrill’s_, and\r\n_Spencer’s_. See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\nIn modern times the _breech-loading_ principle for _heavy ordnance_ has\r\ngained and lost favor at different epochs. On the continent of Europe it\r\nis generally accepted. Italy, however, has committed itself in the\r\nlargest calibers to the enormous 100-ton muzzle-loaders of Sir William\r\nArmstrong. The same inventor introduced his breech-loading field-piece\r\nin England about 1850. His principle was approved and adopted for\r\nvarious calibers about 1858, but partial failures in his system led to\r\nan investigation by a committee of the House of Commons, 1862-63, and\r\nafter a tedious discussion, the breech-loading principle was officially\r\ndiscarded (1866), though many of the guns were retained in the service.\r\nThe successful application of hydraulic machinery in handling and\r\nloading heavy guns (1876) confirmed the government in its choice of\r\nmuzzle-loaders. The difficulty of muzzle-loading in a turret and the\r\nimpossibility of employing the great length of bore necessary to obtain\r\nthe best results was, up to this time, the strong argument in favor of\r\n_breech-loaders_. Loading by hydraulic machinery from beneath the deck\r\nthrough a trap-door outside the turret obviated these objections to\r\nmuzzle-loaders, and gave the gunners ample protection by closing the\r\nport, thus placing these guns for the time being on a par with\r\nbreech-loaders. The bursting of the 38-ton gun on the “Thunderer”\r\n(1878), however, which has been generally attributed to double loading,\r\nhas shaken confidence in hydraulic ramming, and now there is a strong\r\ncurrent in favor of a return to breech-loaders. The splendid performance\r\nof _Krupp_ guns on the practice-ground at Meppen, 1879, and the\r\nnumerous misfortunes which have recently befallen the Woolwich and\r\nElswick systems, have doubtless had their weight in this change of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n=Breech Mechanism.= The mechanism used for opening and closing the\r\nbreech of a fire-arm and securing it against the escape of the gas. In\r\n_small-arms_ this is readily accomplished. The use of the metallic\r\ncartridge-case renders any special gas-check unnecessary, as the case\r\nitself by being expanded against the walls of the chamber serves the\r\npurpose. The various mechanisms used in _small-arms_ have been\r\nclassified as follows: 1st, _Fixed chamber_; 2d, _Movable chamber_. The\r\nsecond class is now obsolete. The _fixed chamber_ class is subdivided\r\ninto--1st, _Barrel moves_; 2d, _Breech-block moves_. The first class\r\ncomprises many of the _shot-guns_ in use, the second, the best known of\r\n_military arms_. Under this latter class are the following subdivisions:\r\n1st, _Sliding block_; 2d, _Sliding and rotating_; 3d, Rotating about an\r\naxis. We find excellent guns under each of these classes which are\r\nfurther subdivided as to the direction of the motions. The _Sharps’_ may\r\nbe taken as typical of the first of these classes, the _Hotchkiss\r\nmagazine_ gun of the second, and the _Springfield_ of the third.\r\n\r\nA similar classification may be made for _breech-loading_ devices in\r\n_heavy ordnance_, but the problem here is not so simple. The pressure is\r\nmuch greater, the masses of metal much larger, and the cartridge must be\r\nused without a case to check the gas. Breech-loaders were impossible\r\nuntil the problem of checking the gas had been solved. The inventor of\r\nthe first successful gas-check was an American, L. W. Broadwell, now\r\nresiding abroad. The term _Broadwell ring_ has been applied to all\r\nsimilar devices. This is a steel ring which fits in a recess reamed out\r\nin the rear of the chamber and abutting upon the breech-block. The\r\ninside of the ring is so shaped as to be pressed by the gas outwards and\r\nbackwards, thus closing both the space outside of the ring and between\r\nit and the block. Broadwell is also the inventor of a breech mechanism\r\nwhich, with a few modifications, is that used by Krupp for all of his\r\nguns. The breech-block slides horizontally through a rectangular slot in\r\nrear of the chamber. In the _Armstrong_ breech-loader, the block called\r\nthe vent-piece is taken out and put in through a rectangular orifice on\r\nthe top of the gun. It is locked in place by a hollow breech-screw. The\r\nFrench use a breech-screw with the threads cut away in longitudinal\r\nrows. The female-screw being similarly arranged, a very small rotation\r\nenables it to be entirely withdrawn. Among American devices are\r\n_Thompson’s_, a breech-block which rolls to the side and opens or closes\r\nthe bore. _Sutcliffe’s_, a cylindrical block, with its axis parallel to\r\nthe one hanging on a pin projecting from the front periphery of the\r\nhollow screw. The block is raised and locked by turning the screw, and\r\nfalls into a recess below when the screw is half turned back. _Mann’s_,\r\nin which the gun rotates upwards about the trunnions something like a\r\nshot-gun, and many others.\r\n\r\n=Breech-pin.= A strong plug firmly screwed in at the breech of a musket\r\nor other fire-arm.\r\n\r\n=Breech-sight.= In gunnery, an instrument having a graduated scale of\r\ntangents by means of which any elevation may be given to a piece.\r\nCorrectly speaking, the breech-sight gives the angle made by the line of\r\naim or sight with the axis of the piece. The base of the breech-sight is\r\na plate of brass curved to fit the base-ring or line, the scale and\r\nslides are similar to those of the pendulum hausse except that a hole is\r\nmade in the plate, instead of a notch to sight through. Breech-sights\r\nare graduated for no _disparts_, a _front-sight_ equal in height to the\r\ndispart being screwed into the top of the muzzle; in the Rodman guns,\r\ninto the seat provided for the purpose between the trunnions.\r\nBreech-sights are also frequently held in sockets, and when the\r\nfront-sight is placed on the trunnion, the socket is on the side of the\r\nbreech. The _pendulum hausse_ (see HAUSSE) is a breech-sight used for\r\nfield-guns to correct the error arising from difference of level in the\r\nwheels of the carriage. The _Quinan breech-sight_ (invented by Lieut. W.\r\nR. Quinan, 4th U. S. Artillery) is an improvement on the pendulum\r\nhausse. It is fixed in a socket on the right side of the breech. The\r\nscale has a spirit-level, by means of which it is made vertical. The\r\nfront sight is a short tube with cross-hairs fixed in it. The advantages\r\nclaimed over the hausse are increased steadiness and accuracy.\r\n\r\n=Bregenz=, or =Bregentz=. A town of Tyrol, Austria; it was occupied by\r\nthe French in 1799.\r\n\r\n=Breisach, Old.= A very old town of the grand duchy of Baden; taken by\r\nAriovistus when he invaded Gaul. Being regarded as the key to the west\r\nof Germany, it was a prominent scene of action during the Thirty Years’\r\nWar, at the conclusion of which it was ceded to the French. During the\r\nnext century it frequently changed masters, now belonging to France and\r\nnow to Austria; its fortifications were destroyed by the French in 1744,\r\nand during the war of the Revolution, in 1793, part of the town was\r\nburned by them. In 1806 the French handed it over to the house of Baden.\r\n\r\n=Breitenfeld.= A village and manor of Saxony, about 5 miles north of\r\nLeipsic. It is historically remarkable for three battles, fought on a\r\nplain in its neighborhood. The first of these, between the Swedes and\r\nthe Imperialists, which was fought September 7, 1631, was of the highest\r\nimportance to Europe, as it secured the permanency of Protestantism and\r\nthe freedom of Germany. Tilly’s pride had reached its highest point\r\nafter the fall of Magdeburg, which took place on May 20, 1631; and in\r\nthe early part of September of the same year he advanced against the\r\nSaxons with an army of about 40,000 men for the purpose of forcing the\r\nelector, John George I., into an alliance with the emperor. Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, king of Sweden, joined by the Saxons, advanced towards\r\nLeipsic, where Tilly lay, the latter advancing into the plain of\r\nBreitenfeld. The Imperial forces were completely defeated, and their\r\nthree most distinguished generals, Tilly, Pappenheim, and Fürstenberg,\r\nwounded. The second battle which Breitenfeld witnessed again, resulted\r\nin the triumph of Swedish valor: it took place on October 23, 1642,\r\nbetween the Swedes, headed by Torstenson, one of the pupils of Gustavus,\r\nwho had invested Leipsic, and the Archduke Leopold, with Gen.\r\nPiccolomini, who were advancing from Dresden to its relief. The Swedes\r\ngained a complete victory over the Imperialists, who fled into Bohemia,\r\nleaving behind them 46 cannon, 121 flags, 69 standards, and the whole of\r\ntheir baggage. The third battle of which Breitenfeld was the scene was\r\nfought on October 16-18, 1813. See LEIPSIC.\r\n\r\n=Bremen= (Northern Germany). Said to have been founded in 788; in 1648\r\nit was erected into a duchy and held by Sweden till 1712; it was taken\r\npossession of by Denmark in 1731, by whom it was ceded to Hanover; it\r\nwas taken by the French in 1757, who were expelled by the Hanoverians in\r\n1758; annexed by Napoleon to the French empire in 1810; its independence\r\nrestored in 1813; its old franchises in 1815 It became a member of the\r\nNorth German Confederation in 1866.\r\n\r\n=Brenneville= (Northwest France).

On the banks of this\r\nriver the French twice defeated the Austrians in 1796.\r\n\r\n=Brentford.= A county town of Middlesex, England. Here Edmund Ironside\r\ndefeated the Danes, May, 1016. It was taken by Charles I., after a sharp\r\nfight, November 12, 1642.\r\n\r\n=Brescelia=, or =Bregelia= (anc. _Brixellum_). A town on the right bank\r\nof the Po, in North Italy. Here the emperor Otho put himself to death in\r\n69. On May 20, 1427, an army under Duke Philip Maria Visconti, of Milan,\r\nwas here defeated by an army sent against him by the republic of Venice,\r\nunder Francis Carmagnola.\r\n\r\n=Brescia.= A town in Northern Italy (the ancient _Brixia_), became\r\nimportant under the Lombards, and suffered by the wars of the Italian\r\nrepublics, being attached to Venice. It was taken by the French under\r\nGaston de Foix in 1512, when it is said 40,000 of the inhabitants were\r\nmassacred. It surrendered to the Austrian general Haynau, March 30,\r\n1849, on severe terms; annexed to Sardinia in 1859.\r\n\r\n=Breslau.= Capital of the province of Silesia, Prussia; it was burnt by\r\nthe Mongols in 1241, and conquered by Frederick II. of Prussia in\r\nJanuary, 1741. A fierce battle took place here between the Austrians and\r\nPrussians, the latter under Prince Bevern, who was defeated November\r\n22,1757. Breslau was taken, but was regained, December 21, the same\r\nyear; besieged by the French, and surrendered to them January, 1807, and\r\nagain in 1813.\r\n\r\n=Bressuire.= A small town of France, department of Deux-Sèvres; it was\r\nfortified during the Middle Ages, and was captured from the English by\r\nthe celebrated Du Guesclin in 1373; it was nearly destroyed during the\r\nwars of La Vendée.\r\n\r\n=Brest.= A seaport in Northwestern France; besieged by Julius Cæsar, 54\r\nB.C.; possessed by the English in 1378; given up to the Duke of Brittany\r\nin 1390. Lord Berkeley and a British fleet and army were repulsed here\r\nwith dreadful loss in 1694. The magazine burnt to the value of some\r\nmillions of pounds sterling, 1744; marine hospital, with 50\r\ngalley-slaves, burnt, in 1766; the magazine again destroyed by fire,\r\nJuly 10, 1784. England maintained a large blockading squadron off the\r\nharbor from 1793 to 1815, but with little injury to France. It is now a\r\nchief naval station of France, and from the fortifications and other\r\nvast works of late construction it is considered impregnable.\r\n\r\n=Bretigny, Peace of.= Concluded with France, May 8, 1360, by which\r\nEngland retained Gascony and Guienne, and acquired other provinces;\r\nrenounced her pretensions to Maine, Anjou, Touraine, and Normandy; was\r\nto receive 3,000,000 crowns, and to release King John, long a prisoner.\r\nThe treaty not being carried out, the king remained and died in London.\r\n\r\n=Breuci.= A powerful people of Pannonia, near the confluence of the\r\nSavus and the Danube, took an active part in the insurrection of the\r\nPannonians and Dalmatians against the Romans, 6 A.D.\r\n\r\n=Brevet.= An honorary rank conferred upon an officer, for meritorious\r\nservices, above the rank he holds in his own corps. In the U. S. army\r\nrank by brevet is conferred, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, for “gallant actions or meritorious services.” A brevet rank\r\ngives no right of command in the particular corps to which the officer\r\nbrevetted belongs, and can be exercised only by special assignment of\r\nthe President. Officers while so serving under assignment are said to\r\nhave _local rank_ (which see).\r\n\r\n=Brevet.= To confer rank or title upon by brevet.\r\n\r\n=Brevetcy.= The rank or condition of a brevet.\r\n\r\n=Bricole.= An improved kind of traces used by the French in drawing and\r\nmanœuvring artillery; analogous to the old drag-rope, but having the\r\naddition of a leather strap or girdle with a buckle, to which the drag\r\nis affixed, and an iron ring and hook at the end to drag by.\r\n\r\n=Bridge.= A structure usually of wood, stone, brick, or iron, erected\r\nover a river or other water-course, or over a ravine, railroad, etc., to\r\nmake a continuous roadway from one bank to the other.\r\n\r\n=Bridge.= In gunnery, two pieces of timber which go between the two\r\ntransoms of a gun-carriage. Not used in the U. S. service.\r\n\r\n=Bridge, Flying.= See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Bridge, Trail.= See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Bridge, Train.= See EQUIPAGE.\r\n\r\n=Bridge, Trestle.= See TRESTLE BRIDGE.\r\n\r\n=Bridges.= When a river is more than 4 feet in depth, or when its bottom\r\nis of mud or quicksand, recourse must be had either to ferrying by means\r\nof boats, rafts, etc., or to military bridges. The latter are always to\r\nbe preferred when circumstances will permit their establishment.\r\n\r\nMilitary bridges are composed of a roadway and its supports; the first\r\nconsists of beams or balks reaching across the adjacent supports, and\r\ncovered with plank called chess.\r\n\r\nThe supports, from which the bridge takes its name, may be either fixed,\r\nas trestles, gabions, carriages, piles, or floating, as pontons, boats\r\nof commerce, rafts, etc.\r\n\r\nPonton bridges are preferable to all others when a passage by main force\r\nor surprise is to be undertaken. They may be constructed on any stream\r\nof sufficient depth; they may be replaced by rafts when the velocity of\r\nthe stream does not exceed 6 feet per second. In swifter currents the\r\nlatter are unmanageable, drag their anchors, and are liable to\r\ndestruction from floating bodies.\r\n\r\nTrestle bridges may be constructed in rivers whose depth does not exceed\r\n9 feet, and whose velocity is not more than 6 feet. They may be employed\r\nwith advantage in rivers of moderate depth and gentle current, with\r\nhard, even bottoms. When the bed of the river is uneven the adjustment\r\nof the trestles to the bottom is very tedious, and if the current is\r\nrapid, almost impossible. When the bed is of mud or fine sand, the\r\nsettlement of the legs is liable to be irregular.\r\n\r\nGabion bridges are used over marshes and shallow streams. They consist\r\nof gabions constructed in the ordinary way, and of a height necessary to\r\ngive a level road; these are placed in rows perpendicular to the axis of\r\nthe bridge, are filled with stones, or gravel, and are capped with a\r\npiece of timber on which the balks rest.\r\n\r\nPile bridges are superior in point of stability to all other military\r\nbridges, but requiring much labor and time in their construction; they\r\nare usually restricted to securing the communications in rear of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n=Bridge-head.= A fortification covering the extremity of a bridge\r\nnearest the enemy. The French term for the same is _tête du pont_.\r\n\r\n=Bridle.= An instrument with which a horse is governed and restrained,\r\nconsisting of a head-stall, a bit and reins, with other appendages,\r\naccording to its particular form and uses.\r\n\r\n=Bridle.= In gunnery, the piece in the interior of a gun-lock, which\r\ncovers and holds in place the tumbler and sear, being itself held by the\r\nscrews on which they turn.\r\n\r\n=Bridle, Arm Protect.= The term for a guard used by the cavalry, which\r\nconsists in having the sword-hilt above the helmet, the blade crossing\r\nthe back of the head, with the point of the left shoulder, and the\r\nbridle-arm; its edge directed to the left and turned a little upwards,\r\nin order to bring the mounting in a proper direction to protect the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n=Bridoon.= The snaffle rein of a military bridle, which acts\r\nindependently of the bit, at the pleasure of the rider.\r\n\r\n=Brieg.= A town of Silesia, Prussia, about 27 miles from Breslau; it was\r\ntaken by Frederick II., April 4, 1741; dismantled by the French in 1807.\r\n\r\n=Briel=, =Brielle=, or =The Brill=. A fortified seaport town on the\r\nnorth side of the island of Voorne, Holland. It was the nucleus of the\r\nDutch republic, having been taken from the Spaniards by William de la\r\nMarck in 1572. This event was the first act of open hostility to Philip\r\nII., and paved the way to the complete liberation of the country from a\r\nforeign yoke. Briel was the first town of Holland which, without\r\nextraneous aid, expelled the French in 1813. The celebrated admirals De\r\nWitt and Van Tromp were natives of this place.\r\n\r\n=Brienne=, or =Brienne le Château=. A town of France, department of the\r\nAube.

Gen. Taylor, on the way from Victoria to\r\nMonterey, having learned that Santa Anna was threatening him with an\r\noverwhelming force, decided to withdraw his troops from their camp at\r\nAgua Nueva to a position more favorable for withstanding a superior\r\nforce, which had been selected a little south of the small village of\r\nBuena Vista, at a point where the road passed through a mountain gorge\r\ncalled Angostura. Accordingly, on the afternoon of February 21, the camp\r\nat Agua Nueva was broken up, and Santa Anna, believing the American\r\nforces were retreating, eagerly pursued them until he was drawn into\r\ntheir chosen position. After a useless summons to surrender, on the\r\nafternoon of the 22d the Mexicans opened the attack on the American\r\nleft, but they made no impression, while they suffered severe loss.\r\nDuring the night the Mexicans occupied a position on the heights to the\r\neast of the American lines with the intention of forcing their left\r\nflank, and it was here that the fighting commenced on the 23d, and\r\ncontinued during the day with varying success, finally resulting in the\r\nrepulse of the enemy. Meanwhile a force of Mexican cavalry had been\r\ndetached to attack the American camp at Buena Vista, but was gallantly\r\nrepulsed. The final attack was made against the American centre--where\r\nGen. Taylor commanded in person--by Santa Anna himself, with his entire\r\nreserve, but he was met with such a deadly fire from the American\r\nbatteries that he was obliged to draw off his much-diminished forces,\r\nand during the night he fell back to Agua Nueva. The American loss in\r\nkilled and wounded was about 700; the Mexicans lost about 2000.\r\n\r\n=Buenos Ayres.= A province of the Argentine Republic, with a capital of\r\nthe same name.

The first bullets used were round, and were designated by\r\nthe number weighing one pound. The sizes employed were very large. Until\r\nquite recently the round ball still held its place with rifles and\r\nsmooth-bores. Various devices were used for making it take the grooves\r\nof the rifle,--a guard-patch being among the best. (See SMALL-ARMS.) It\r\nwas with this that the early settlers of America won their reputation as\r\nmarksmen. Robins, in 1742, showed the superiority of the conical form,\r\nbut it was not till about 1840 that round balls were generally\r\ndiscarded. The conical bullet was often used in grooves with an\r\nincreasing twist, and gave wonderfully accurate results at short range.\r\nFor long ranges, long bullets are necessary, and these require uniform\r\ntwists, which are now generally used in military arms. Various forms of\r\nthe elongated bullets were used. Most of these bullets had an expansive\r\nbase, either hollow or plugged with wood; the design being to force the\r\nsoft lead outward, so as to cause it to fit the grooves of the rifle,\r\nand thus give the bullet a rotation around its long axis during the\r\nmotion forward. (See SMALL-ARMS.) This rotation, as is well known,\r\nincreases the range and precision. Bullets were formerly cast, but now\r\nthey are more frequently stamped in steel dies, and, as in\r\nbreech-loading arms, the bullet takes the grooves by compression; the\r\nexploding base is omitted. The form of bullet now used in military arms\r\nis the cylindrical conoidal. The tendency recently has been to reduce\r\nthe caliber. (See PROJECTILES.) Copper bullets are used by the\r\nCircassians. Bullets of stone were used in 1514; iron ones are mentioned\r\nin the _Fœdera_, 1550, and leaden ones were made before the close of the\r\n16th century.\r\n\r\n=Bullets, Explosive.= Oblong bullets carrying a percussion-cap on the\r\nfront end and sometimes containing a small charge of powder in a cavity,\r\nused to blow up caissons and magazines. There is a strong sentiment\r\nagainst the use of these bullets in firing at troops.\r\n\r\n=Bullets, Express-.= An explosive bullet of great killing power, used in\r\nhunting large game. It is of large caliber but quite light, being much\r\nshorter than the ordinary rifle-bullet. A cylindrical cavity bored in at\r\nthe point carries a small metallic cartridge-case filled with powder. It\r\nis fired with a large charge of powder, which, owing to its lack of\r\nweight, gives it a high initial velocity and a very flat trajectory up\r\nto about 200 yards, obviating the necessity for an elevating sight. _The\r\nWinchester Express-bullet_ (a good type of those made in America) has a\r\ncaliber of .50, weighs 300 grains, and is fired with 95 grains of\r\npowder, giving an initial velocity of 1640 feet. It is made of pure\r\nlead, the softness of which increases its deadliness. The shock from\r\nthis bullet will bring down the largest game. See EXPRESS-RIFLE.\r\n\r\n=Bullets, Grooved.= Bullets having grooves, or cannelures. These grooves\r\nwere originally used to increase the relative resistance of the air on\r\nthe _rear_ of the bullet, thus assisting the rotation in keeping the\r\npoint to the front. In muzzle-loading arms they also increased the\r\n_setting up_ of the bullet to take the grooves. They are now used to\r\nhold the lubricant, and to facilitate the swaging action of the grooves\r\nand lands in breech-loading guns. For the other form of modern bullets,\r\nsee BULLETS, PATCHED.\r\n\r\n=Bullets, Patched.= One of the forms of modern rifle-bullets. The bullet\r\nhas wrapped around its cylindrical portion a layer of thin paper called\r\nthe _patch_. The bullet is perfectly smooth. The other form has grooves,\r\nor cannelures. (See BULLETS, GROOVED.) The lubricant for the patched\r\nbullet is a greased wad or disk of wax, placed between powder and\r\nbullet. The _grooved bullet_, carrying its own lubricant, is best\r\nadapted to shallow lands and grooves. The _patched bullet_ to sharp\r\nlands. The grooved bullet would seem to be the best for military\r\nservice, as the cartridge-case can be tightly crimped upon it, making\r\nthe case waterproof. For very long range the best shooting has been done\r\nwith patched bullets.\r\n\r\n=Bullets, Percussion-.= See BULLETS, EXPLOSIVE.\r\n\r\n=Bullock.= See PACK AND DRAUGHT ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n=Bull Run Battles.= See MANASSAS.\r\n\r\n=Bull’s-eye.= In gunnery and archery, is the centre of a target.\r\n\r\n=Bulwark.= In fortification, a rampart or bastion; an outwork for\r\ndefense; that which secures against an enemy; a shelter or means of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n=Bunker Hill.= A hill in Charlestown, now part of Boston, Mass., which\r\ngave its name to the first important battle of the American Revolution.\r\nThe Americans learning that Gen. Gage, who was in command of the British\r\nforces in Boston, intended to fortify Bunker Hill, determined to\r\nforestall his design, and for this purpose a detachment of 1000 men\r\nunder Col. Prescott was ordered on the night of June 16, 1775, to throw\r\nup a breastwork on the hill. After a consultation, however, it was\r\ndecided to fortify instead another eminence which was nearer to Boston,\r\nknown as Breed’s Hill. During the night they worked with such activity\r\nthat by daybreak a strong redoubt was nearly completed. Upon its\r\ndiscovery by the British on the morning of the 17th, they opened fire on\r\nit from the ships in the harbor, and Gen. Gage sent about 3000 men under\r\nHowe and Pigot to attack it. They landed under cover of the fire from\r\nthe guns, and setting fire to Charlestown, advanced to the attack. The\r\nAmericans awaited their approach in silence until the whites of their\r\neyes could be seen, then poured a deadly fire into their ranks, causing\r\nthem to retreat in disorder. They were rallied by Howe, and again\r\nadvanced over the same ground with a like result as on the first attack.\r\nClinton now arrived with reinforcements, and an attack was made on three\r\nsides of the redoubt at once. The ammunition of the Americans being now\r\nexhausted they met their assailants with clubbed muskets, but the\r\nsuperiority of the British in numbers being so great, Col. Prescott\r\nordered a retreat. This was effected across Charlestown Neck, where they\r\nwere exposed to a galling fire from the ships in the harbor. During the\r\nretreat Gen. Warren was killed, and the Bunker Hill monument erected to\r\ncommemorate this engagement now stands near the spot where he fell. The\r\nBritish loss was over 1000 killed and wounded; the Americans lost less\r\nthan half that number.\r\n\r\n=Bureaux.= See Military Departments throughout this work under\r\nappropriate headings.\r\n\r\n=Buren.= A town of Switzerland, canton of Berne.

In 413 they established a kingdom, comprising the present\r\nBurgundy, large parts of Switzerland, with Alsace, Savoy, Provence,\r\netc., Gondicaire, their leader, the first king. It was conquered by the\r\nFranks, 534. Annexed to France, 1477.\r\n\r\n=Burhampoor.= A town of Hindostan, in the province of Bengal.

It is screwed in. The object of bushing a piece\r\nis to prevent deterioration of the vent, or provide a new one, when this\r\nhas already occurred. In bronze pieces pure copper is always used in\r\nbushing, as it is not so liable to run from heat as gun-metal. Only\r\nrifled and bronze pieces are bushed.\r\n\r\n=Bushwhackers.= This term was used during the civil war to designate a\r\nclass of men who claimed to be non-combatants in the presence of a\r\nsuperior force, and who, to outward appearance, pursued their peaceful\r\navocations, but who did not hesitate, when an opportunity offered, to\r\nslay stragglers, and pick off soldiers from ambush.

He is the next in rank below a major, and in the U. S. army\r\nis responsible for the camp and garrison equipage, the arms, ammunition,\r\nand clothing of his company.\r\n\r\nThere is no position in the army that will give as much satisfaction in\r\nreturn for an honest, capable, and conscientious discharge of his duty\r\nas that of captain or commanding officer of a company. There is a reward\r\nin having done his full duty to his company, that no disappointment of\r\ndistinction, no failure can deprive him of; his seniors may overlook him\r\nin giving credits, unfortunate circumstances may defeat his fondest\r\nhopes, and the crown of laurel may never rest upon his brow, but the\r\nreward that follows upon the faithful discharge of his duty to his\r\ncompany he cannot be deprived of by any disaster, neglect, or injustice.\r\n\r\nHe receives it whenever he looks upon his little command, and sees the\r\nharmony, comfort, and discipline that prevail; he feels it when he comes\r\nto part with his men in the due course of promotion, or as they\r\nindividually take their discharge after a faithful service; he remembers\r\nit when, in after-years, no matter if rank and honors have in the mean\r\ntime fallen upon him, he meets an old soldier who, with respect and\r\naffection, still calls him his captain.\r\n\r\nHe is a small sovereign, powerful and great within his little domain,\r\nbut no imbecile monarch ever suffered more from intrigues, factions, and\r\nencroachments than an incapable company commander; no tyrant king must\r\ncontend more with rebellions, insurrections, and defections than an\r\narbitrary and unjust captain, and no wise and beneficent ruler ever\r\nderived more heartfelt homage, more faithful services, or more patriotic\r\ndevotion than a just, competent, and faithful commander receives from\r\nhis company. They will love him truly, they will obey him faithfully,\r\nand whilst there is life they will stand by him in the hour of battle.\r\n\r\nThe command of a company divides itself into two kinds of duty,\r\nrequiring very different capacity, viz., _Government_ and\r\n_Administration_. The former requires force of character, judgment, and\r\ndiscretion, and has often been well performed without much capacity for\r\nthe latter. Administration requires a certain amount of knowledge\r\nabsolutely indispensable to a discharge of a duty.\r\n\r\n_Government._--Under this head may be included instruction in tactics\r\nand discipline, the preservation of order and subordination, and the\r\ncultivation of a military spirit and pride in the profession among the\r\nmen. It involves the appointing and reduction of non-commissioned\r\nofficers, and the subject of rewards and punishments.\r\n\r\n_Administration._--Providing the clothing and subsistence, and keeping\r\nthe accounts of soldiers in order, that they may be paid, and attending\r\nto the transportation of the men and their supplies, belong under this\r\nhead. They involve the keeping of the records of the company, and the\r\npay and clothing accounts of the men; the drawing and distributing of\r\nsupplies, and the care and accountability of public and company\r\nproperty. The efficient administration of the affairs of a company\r\ngreatly facilitates the discipline and government of the company, makes\r\nthe men content and cheerful in the performance of their duties, and\r\nattaches them to their commander.\r\n\r\n=Captaincy.= The rank, post, or commission of a captain.\r\n\r\n=Captaincy-general.= The office, power, territory, or jurisdiction of a\r\ncaptain-general.\r\n\r\n=Captain-General.= This was the proper appellation of a\r\ncommander-in-chief till Marlborough’s time, if not later. The rank is\r\nsometimes still given on extraordinary occasions. It was born by the\r\nMarquis of Wellesley during his government in India, and is applied to\r\nthe governor-general of the Canadas. In the United States, the governor\r\nof a State is captain-general of the militia. _Captain-lieutenant_, an\r\nofficer, who with the rank of a captain, and pay of lieutenant,\r\ncommands a company or troop.\r\n\r\n=Captainry.= The power, or command, over a certain district;\r\nchieftainship; captainship.\r\n\r\n=Captainship.= The condition, rank, post, or authority of a captain or\r\nchief commander. Also skill in military affairs; as, to show good\r\ncaptainship.\r\n\r\n=Captive.= A prisoner taken by force or stratagem in war, by an enemy;\r\nmade prisoner, especially in war; kept in bondage or confinement.\r\n\r\n=Captivity.= The state of being a prisoner, or of being in the power of\r\nthe enemy, by force or the fate of war.\r\n\r\n=Captor.= One who takes, as a prisoner or a prize.\r\n\r\n=Capture.= The act of taking or seizing by force; seizure; arrest; as,\r\nthe capture of an enemy. The thing taken; a prize; prey taken by force,\r\nsurprise, or stratagem.\r\n\r\n=Captured Property.= As civilization has advanced during the last\r\ncenturies, so has likewise steadily advanced, especially in war on land,\r\nthe distinction between the private individual belonging to a hostile\r\ncountry and the hostile country itself, with its men in arms. The\r\nprinciple has been more and more acknowledged that the unarmed citizen\r\nis to be spared in person, property, and honor, as much as the\r\nexigencies of war will admit. A victorious army appropriates all public\r\nmoney, seizes all public movable property until further direction by its\r\ngovernment, and sequesters for its own benefit or that of its government\r\nall the revenues of real property belonging to the hostile government or\r\nnation. The title to such real property remains in abeyance during\r\nmilitary occupation, and until the conquest is made complete. As a\r\ngeneral rule, the property belonging to churches, to hospitals, or other\r\nestablishments of an exclusively charitable nature, to establishments of\r\neducation, or foundations for the promotion of knowledge, whether public\r\nschools, universities, academies of learning, or observatories, museums\r\nof the fine arts, or of a scientific character,--such property is not to\r\nbe considered public property; but it may be taxed or used when the\r\npublic service may require it. Classical works of art, libraries,\r\nscientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical\r\ntelescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable\r\ninjury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged\r\nor bombarded. And if they can be removed without injury, the ruler of\r\nthe conquering state or nation may order them to be seized and removed\r\nfor the benefit of the said nation. The ultimate ownership is to be\r\nsettled by the ensuing treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThe United States acknowledge and protect, in hostile countries occupied\r\nby them, religion and morality; strictly private property; the persons\r\nof the inhabitants, especially those of women; and the sacredness of\r\ndomestic relations. Offenses to the contrary are rigorously punished.\r\nThis does not interfere with the right of the victorious invader to tax\r\nthe people or their property, to levy forced loans, to billet soldiers,\r\nor to appropriate property, especially houses, land, boats or ships, and\r\nchurches for temporary and military uses. Private property can be seized\r\nonly by way of military necessity, except the owner forfeits his right\r\nto it by committing a crime or offense against the victorious power. All\r\ncaptures and booty belong, according to the modern law of war, primarily\r\nto the government of the captor. See STORES, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Capua.= A town of Naples, in the province of Terra di Lavoro; took the\r\npart of Hannibal when his army wintered here after the battle of Cannæ,\r\n216 B.C., and, it is said, became enervated through luxury.

During the Middle Ages, Capua was\r\nsuccessively subjugated by the Greeks, Saracens, Normans, and Germans.\r\nIt was restored to Naples in 1424, and was taken, November 2, 1860, by\r\nGaribaldi.\r\n\r\n=Capuchons= (_Fr._).

No record of the early history\r\nof Carthage has been preserved. First alliance of Carthaginians and\r\nRomans, 509 B.C.; the Carthaginians in Sicily were defeated at Himera by\r\nGelo, 480 B.C.; they took Agrigentum, 406 B.C., and were defeated by\r\nAgathocles, 310 B.C. The first Punic war began (which lasted\r\ntwenty-three years) in 264 B.C., and ended in 241 B.C. Hamilcar Barcas\r\nwas sent into Spain, and took with him his son, the famous Hannibal, 237\r\nB.C.

Near here,\r\non July 5, 1861, an engagement took place between some of Gen. Lyon’s\r\ntroops under Col. Sigel, and a superior force of Confederates under Gen.\r\nRains and Col Parsons. The Union loss was 13 killed and 21 wounded.\r\n\r\n=Carthoun.= The ancient cannon royal, carrying a 66-pound ball, with a\r\npoint-blank range of 185 paces, and an extreme one of about 2000.

The case\r\nis a cylindrical bag of flannel, wildbore, or serge, in which the charge\r\nis placed. The mouth is closed by tying with twine, forming the _choke_,\r\nwhich is always turned towards the muzzle when the gun is charged. For\r\nchambered pieces the mouth of the cartridge-bag is closed with a\r\n_cartridge-block_ to give it a proper form. For some services the\r\ncartridge is attached to the projectile, in others it is carried\r\nseparately. See ORDNANCE, AMMUNITION FOR.\r\n\r\nFor _small-arms_, is the complete charge when the powder and lead are in\r\nthe same case; if separate, it applies only to the powder and its case.\r\nA case containing powder only is called a _blank cartridge_.\r\nCartridge-cases for military small-arms were formerly made of paper. In\r\nloading the gun the case was torn and the powder and ball put in\r\nseparately. By using an inflammable paper the cartridge was afterwards\r\nused entire, especially in pistols and breech-loaders. Paper cases made\r\nvery strong and reinforced by metallic heads are still much used in\r\nbreech-loading shot-guns. Linen or cloth cases were also used at one\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of breech-loaders into the military service has led to\r\nthe universal adoption of _metallic cartridges_. The cases are cylinders\r\nof copper or brass, closed at the breech end, and holding both powder\r\nand bullet, the latter being retained in the case by a slight crimp. A\r\nsmall quantity of fulminate in the base inflames the powder upon being\r\nstruck by the firing-pin. England is behind all other nations in the use\r\nof the _Boxer cartridge_, the case of which is made by a _wrapping_ of\r\nthin sheet-brass. In the manufacture of metallic cartridges the United\r\nStates leads the world. Millions were supplied the Turks in their late\r\nwar with Russia by the Winchester Arms Company, of New Haven, Conn.\r\nMetallic cartridge are _reloading_ and _single fire_. _Reloading_\r\ncartridges have an external primer, which can be renewed for successive\r\nloadings. The _single fire_ have the fulminate inside the base, and\r\ncannot readily be reloaded. The copper cartridges for the U. S. service\r\nrifle, made at Frankford Arsenal, Pa., are of this latter class.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge-bag.= See CARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge-bags.= See ORDNANCE, AMMUNITION FOR, AMMUNITION FOR FIELD\r\nSERVICE.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge-belt.= A belt for carrying small-arm cartridges.

It\r\ncontains a larger charge than the ordinary cylindrical cartridge for the\r\nsame caliber. The cartridge used in the Martini-Henry is of this shape.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge-box.= A leathern case, with cells for cartridges, which are\r\nprotected by a flap of leather. This box is suspended by a leathern\r\nstrap, which passes over the left shoulder and under the right arm of\r\nthe wearer, or is suspended from the waist-belt, as in the U. S.\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge, Buck-and-ball.= A cartridge containing a round musket-ball\r\nand 3 buckshot, formerly much used in smooth-bore muskets.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge, Buckshot.= Containing a charge of buckshot.

M. Wright, U. S. Ordnance Corps, in which two or more bullets or\r\npieces of lead are substituted for the ordinary bullet, with the idea of\r\ndoing more execution at short ranges.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge-paper.= A stout paper formerly used in making military\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge, Reloading.= See CARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n=Cartridge, Rim-fire.= A metallic cartridge in which the fulminate is\r\nplaced in the rim surrounding the head. This rim being struck at any\r\npoint, explodes the powder. Formerly much used in pistols and magazine\r\nguns.

The parts to be\r\nhardened, such as the _hammer_, _tumbler_, etc., were inclosed in an\r\nairtight iron box, filled with charcoal, bones, particles of horn, or\r\nother carbonizing substance. The box and its contents were then\r\nsubmitted to prolonged heat. The process is that of incomplete\r\ncementation (which see).\r\n\r\n=Casemate.= Was originally a loop-holed gallery excavated in a bastion,\r\nfrom which the garrison could fire on an enemy who had obtained\r\npossession of the ditch without risk of loss to themselves. The term was\r\nafterwards applied to a bomb-proof vault in a fortress, which is\r\ndesigned for the protection of the garrison, without direct reference to\r\nthe annoyance of the enemy. A casemated battery consists of such a vault\r\nor vaults, with openings for the guns.\r\n\r\n=Casemate Carriage.= A gun-carriage used in casemates. See ORDNANCE,\r\nCARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Casemate Gun.= A gun mounted in a casemate.\r\n\r\n=Casemates Nouvelles= (_Fr._).

The projectile has thinner walls\r\nthan the ordinary shell. To fill it a tube is inserted in the fuze-hole,\r\nthe balls are introduced, and melted sulphur or rosin is poured in to\r\nfill up the interstices and keep the balls in position. When this has\r\nsolidified the tube is withdrawn, leaving a vacant space for a small\r\nbursting charge. This description answers for the two kinds used,--the\r\nspherical case for the 12-pounder smooth-bore and the oblong case for\r\nrifle guns. Case-shot should be burst in the air a short distance in\r\nfront of the troops fired upon. Time-fuzes are, therefore, used with\r\nboth; the Bormann-fuze for the former, and the paper fuze for the\r\nlatter. In Europe this ammunition is called _shrapnel_, from the\r\ninventor. There the term case-shot is applied to what is called in the\r\nUnited States _canister_,--that is, a thin case filled with bullets,\r\nused for short range without fuzes, the case being disrupted in the gun.\r\n\r\n=Cashier.= To dismiss from the service with ignominy.

Celeres\r\nwere properly distinguished from other troops, by being lightly armed\r\nand acting always on foot.\r\n\r\n=Cells.= Places of solitary confinement in which soldiers are placed, as\r\npunishment for serious crimes.\r\n\r\n=Celtiberi=, or =Celtiberians=. An ancient and warlike people of Spain,\r\nwho are renowned in history for their long and obstinate resistance to\r\nthe Romans. In the second Punic war, after giving important aid to the\r\nCarthaginians, they were induced by the generosity of Scipio to accept\r\nthe alliance of Rome. They revolted against Rome in 181 B.C., but were\r\nappeased by Gracchus in 179. War was renewed in 153, and continued with\r\nvarying success until after the capture of Numantia, 134 B.C. In spite\r\nof this great blow the Celtiberi again renewed the war under Sertorius,\r\nand it was only after his fall that they began to adopt the Roman\r\nlanguage, dress, and manners.\r\n\r\n=Cement.= Hydraulic cements are much used in building permanent\r\nfortifications. The cement used by the Romans in their great sea-walls,\r\naqueducts, etc., which are still standing as monuments of their civil\r\nengineering, was _pozzuolana_, a volcanic earth from near _Baiæ_, Italy.\r\nIt is still an article of export from Italy. The most noted modern\r\ncement is Portland, made artificially in England by burning a mixture of\r\nthe chalk and clay from the valley of the Medway.\r\n\r\n=Cementation.= In metallurgy, is the process of converting metals by\r\nabsorption under great heat. Specially applied to the conversion of iron\r\ninto steel by causing it to absorb carbon. The iron bars are imbedded in\r\ncharcoal and exposed to prolonged heat in a closed furnace. The\r\nqualities of the resulting steel vary with the degree and duration of\r\nthe heating. The bars, when removed, are called _blistered steel_ from\r\ntheir appearance. See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR, BLISTERED STEEL.\r\n\r\n=Cenotaph.= The empty tomb of a hero, or monument erected in honor of a\r\nperson, without the body of the deceased being interred in or near it.\r\n\r\n=Centesimation.= In ancient military history, a mild kind of military\r\npunishment, in cases of desertion, mutiny, and the like, when only every\r\none hundredth man was executed.\r\n\r\n=Central America.= Includes the republics of Guatemala, San Salvador,\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica (which see). They declared their\r\nindependence September 21, 1821, and separated from the Mexican\r\nConfederation July 21, 1823. The states made a treaty of union between\r\nthemselves March 21, 1847. There has been among them since much anarchy\r\nand bloodshed.\r\n\r\n=Centre.= A point equally distant from the extremities of a line,\r\nfigure, or body; the middle point or place of anything.\r\n\r\n=Centre of an Army.= The body of troops occupying the place in the line\r\nbetween the wings. See TARGET.\r\n\r\n=Centre of Gravity.= The point of a body about which all its parts are\r\nbalanced. This is a matter of great importance in cannon, both for\r\nmechanical manœuvres and for ordinary handling. In all large guns in the\r\nUnited States, and in many in Europe, the axis of the trunnions passes\r\nthrough the centre of gravity of the gun. Such guns have no\r\npreponderance, and need no support in firing except the trunnions. This\r\ninnovation was introduced by the genius of Rodman, and brought many\r\nadvantages in the handling of heavy guns. In projectiles, the _centre of\r\ngravity_, or _inertia_, is also a thing of moment. Spherical projectiles\r\nin which this point does not coincide with the _centre of figure_ are\r\nsaid to be eccentric, and are subject to certain deviations (see\r\nPROJECTILES); _deviation_ of the relative position of these points\r\ninfluences the flight also of rifle projectiles.\r\n\r\n=Centre of the Bastion.= In fortification, is the intersection made by\r\nthe two demi-gorges.\r\n\r\n=Centrifugal Gun.= A form of machine gun in which balls are thrown from\r\na chambered disk rotating with great speed.\r\n\r\n=Centrobaric Method.= The method ordinarily used to determine by\r\ncalculation the centre of gravity of a projected gun. The principle used\r\nis that the volume generated by any surface in revolving about a fixed\r\naxis is measured by the product of the surface into the path described\r\nby its centre of gravity. The moments of the weights of the several\r\nparts are referred to an axis usually taken tangent to the knob of the\r\ncascabel. The sum of these moments, divided by the weight of the piece,\r\ngives the distance of the centre of gravity from the assumed axis. In\r\nhomogeneous guns, the volumes of the several parts can be used instead\r\nof the weights.\r\n\r\n=Centurion.= A military officer among the ancient Romans, who commanded\r\na (_centum_) hundred men.\r\n\r\n=Century.= In an ancient military sense, meant a hundred soldiers, who\r\nwere employed in working the battering-ram.\r\n\r\n=Cephalonia.= One of the Ionian Islands; was taken from the Ætolians by\r\nthe Romans 189 B.C., and given to the Athenians by Hadrian in 135. It\r\nwas conquered by the Normans in 1146, afterwards passed into the\r\npossession of the Venetians, and was taken by the English in 1819.\r\n\r\n=Cephisus.= A river in Attica, near which Walter de Brienne, duke of\r\nAthens, was defeated and slain by the Catalans in 1311.\r\n\r\n=Cercelée=, or =Recercelée=. In heraldry, is a cross circling or curling\r\nat the ends, like a ram’s horn.\r\n\r\n=Cercle= (_Grand-cercle_), Fr. A form observed under the old government\r\nof France, by which it was directed that every evening at a specific\r\nhour the sergeants and corporals of brigade should assemble to receive\r\norders, the former standing in front of the latter. Subsequent to the\r\ngrand cercle, a smaller one was made in each regiment, when general or\r\nregimental orders were again repeated to the sergeants of each regiment,\r\nand from them communicated to the officers of the several companies.\r\n\r\n=Ceremonies, Stated Military.= Exercises, such as parades, reviews,\r\ninspections, escorts of the color, escorts of honor, funeral honors,\r\nguard-mounting, etc.\r\n\r\n=Cerignola.= A town of South Italy, in the province of Capitanata. Here,\r\nin 1503, the French were defeated by the Spaniards, and the Duke of\r\nNemours, who commanded the former, was slain.\r\n\r\n=Cerro Gordo.= A celebrated mountain-pass in Mexico, about 60 miles\r\nnorthwest of Vera Cruz. Here an army of about 12,000 Mexicans under\r\nSanta Anna was totally defeated by about 8000 U. S. troops under Gen.\r\nScott, April 18, 1847. The Mexicans lost about 1000 killed and wounded,\r\nbesides 3000 prisoners; the American loss was 431 killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n=Certificate of Disability.= See DISABILITY.\r\n\r\n=Certificate of Merit.= See MERIT, CERTIFICATE OF.\r\n\r\n=Cessation of Arms.= An armistice or truce, agreed to by the commanders\r\nof armies, to give them time for a capitulation, or for other purposes.\r\n\r\n=Ceuta.= A fortified seaport of Morocco, opposite Gibraltar. The castle\r\nstands on the highest point of the ancient _Abyla_, one of the pillars\r\nof Hercules, terminating a peninsula. This was a Mauritanian town under\r\nthe Romans, and in 1415 was taken from the Moors by the Portuguese. In\r\n1580 it passed into the possession of the Spanish, in whose hands it\r\nafterwards remained.\r\n\r\n=Ceylon= (anc. _Taprobane_). An island in the Indian Ocean. It was\r\ninvaded by the Portuguese Almeyda, 1505, but it was known to the Romans\r\nin the time of Claudius, 41. The Dutch landed in Ceylon in 1602; they\r\ncaptured the capital, Colombo, in 1503. Intercourse with the British\r\nbegan in 1713. A large portion of the country was taken by them in 1782,\r\nbut was restored in 1783. The Dutch settlements were seized by the\r\nBritish, 1795. Ceylon was ceded to the British by the peace of Amiens in\r\n1802. The British troops were treacherously massacred or imprisoned by\r\nthe Adigar of Candy, at Colombo, June 26, 1803. The complete sovereignty\r\nof the island was assumed by England in 1815.\r\n\r\n=Chæronea= (_Bœotia_). Here Greece was ruined by Philip, 32,000\r\nMacedonians defeating 30,000 Thebans, Athenians, etc., August 6 or 7,\r\n338 B.C. Here Archelaus, lieutenant of Mithridates, was defeated by\r\nSylla, and 110,000 Cappadocians were slain, 86 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Chain.= A chain made of a kind of wire, divided into links of an equal\r\nlength, is made use of by military engineers for setting out works on\r\nthe ground, because cord lines are apt to shrink and give way.\r\n\r\n=Chain-ball.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Chain-mail.= A kind of armor made of interlaced rings, both flexible\r\nand strong; much used in the 12th and 13th centuries.\r\n\r\n=Chain-shot.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Chair.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, NOMENCLATURE OF ARTILLERY\r\nCARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Chalcedon.= In Asia Minor, opposite Byzantium, colonized by Magarians\r\nabout 684 B.C. It was taken by Darius, 505 B.C.; by the Romans, 74;\r\nplundered by the Goths, 259 A.D.; taken by Chosroes the Persian, 609; by\r\nOrchan the Turk in 1338.\r\n\r\n=Chalcis.= An ancient Greek city, of great antiquity, the capital of the\r\nisland of Eubœa. It rose to great eminence, but finally became a\r\ntributary of Athens, from whose sway it revolted several times, being as\r\noften, however, subdued, and held until the downfall of the Athenian\r\nempire at the close of the Peloponnesian war. In later times it was\r\nsuccessively occupied by the Macedonians, Antiochus, Mithridates, and\r\nthe Romans. It joined the Achæans in the last war against the Romans,\r\nand the town was in consequence destroyed by Mummius. The modern city of\r\nEgripo, or Negropont, built on its site, for a time in possession of the\r\nVenetians, was taken by the Turks in 1470.\r\n\r\n=Chalgrove.= In Oxfordshire, England. At a skirmish here with Prince\r\nRupert, June 18, 1643, John Hampden, of the Parliament party, was\r\nmortally wounded. A column was erected to his memory, June 18, 1843.\r\n\r\n=Challenge.= The act of a sentinel in questioning or demanding the\r\ncountersign from those who appear at his post.\r\n\r\n=Challenge.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 26, 27, and 28.\r\n\r\n=Challenge of Members of Courts-martial.= When a member shall be\r\nchallenged by a prisoner, he must state his cause of challenge, of which\r\nthe court shall, after due deliberation, determine the relevancy or\r\nvalidity, and decide accordingly; and no challenge to more than one\r\nmember at a time shall be received by the court.\r\n\r\n=Châlons-sur-Marne.= A town of France, in the department of Marne. Here\r\nthe emperor Aurelian defeated Tetricus, the last of the pretenders to\r\nthe throne termed the Thirty Tyrants, 274; and here in 451 Aetius\r\ndefeated Attila the Hun, compelling him to retire into Pannonia.\r\n\r\n=Chamade.= A signal made for parley by beat of drum.\r\n\r\n=Chamber.= Of a mine, that place where the powder is deposited.\r\n\r\n=Chamber.= In howitzers, and mortars of the old model, was the smallest\r\npart of the bore, and contained the charge of powder. In the howitzers\r\nthe chamber was cylindrical, and was united with the large cylinder of\r\nthe bore by a conical surface; the angles of intersection of the conical\r\nsurface with the cylinders of the bore and chamber were rounded (in\r\nprofile) by arcs of circles. In the 8-inch howitzer, the chamber was\r\nunited with the cylinder of the bore by spherical surface, in order that\r\nthe shell might, when necessary, be inserted without a sabot. The\r\nchamber is omitted in _all_ cannon of the late models, the cylinder of\r\nthe bore terminating at the bottom in a semi-ellipsoid. The old chambers\r\nwere subcaliber. The first use of a chamber _larger_ than the bore\r\noccurred, it is believed, in a gun invented by an American named Ferris.\r\nThe gun had a great range. One of the most important improvements in\r\nrecent ordnance consists in the use of this chamber. The English, who\r\ndeserve the credit of first appreciating it, now use it in all their\r\nlargest guns. See ORDNANCE, HISTORY OF.\r\n\r\n=Chambersburg.= The capital of Franklin Co., Pa. This place was the\r\nscene of several exciting incidents during the civil war. It was\r\noccupied by a party of Confederate cavalry under Gen. Stuart in 1862, by\r\na part of Gen. Ewell’s forces in June, 1863, and next month almost\r\ntotally destroyed by fire by a party of Confederate cavalry under Gen.\r\nMcCausland.\r\n\r\n=Chamfron=, or =Chamfrain=. The frontlet of a barbed or armed horse,\r\nusually having a spike between the eyes.\r\n\r\n=Champ de Mars.= An open square in front of the Military School, Paris,\r\nwhich was used for the great meetings of the French people, reviews,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Champigny.= A town of France, department of the Seine, 8 miles\r\neast-southeast of Paris. On November 30, 1870, a force of 120,000 French\r\nunder Gens. Trochu and Ducrot, who made a sortie from Paris, were met\r\nnear here by the Germans, and some severe fighting ensued, with great\r\nloss on both sides, the French holding the taken possessions until the\r\ncontest was renewed, December 2, when the French were compelled to\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n=Champion Hills.= In Hinds Co., Miss., west of Jackson. Here the\r\nConfederate forces under Gen. Pemberton were defeated by the Union\r\ntroops under Gen. Grant, May 16, 1863.\r\n\r\n=Champlain, Lake.= An extensive body of water forming part of the\r\nboundary between the States of Vermont and New York, and extending\r\nnorthward a few miles beyond the Canada line. It was the scene of\r\nengagements between the Americans and British during the war of\r\nindependence. On its waters also, in 1814, Commodore Macdonough gained a\r\nvictory over the British fleet.\r\n\r\n=Chancellorsville.= A small village of Spottsylvania Co., Va., near the\r\nRappahannock River, about 65 miles north by west from Richmond. This\r\nplace was the scene of several sanguinary conflicts between the Federal\r\narmy of the Potomac under Gen. Hooker and the Confederates under Gen.\r\nLee. On April 28, 1863, the Federal army crossed the Rappahannock; on\r\nMay 2, Gen. “Stonewall” Jackson furiously attacked and routed the right\r\nwing, but was mortally wounded by his own party firing on him by\r\nmistake. Gen. Stuart took his command, and after a severe conflict on\r\nMay 3 and 4, with great loss to both parties, the Federals were\r\ncompelled to recross the Rappahannock. The struggle was compared to that\r\nat Hougoumont during the battle of Waterloo.\r\n\r\n=Chandelier.= In military engineering, a wooden frame, which was filled\r\nwith fascines, to form a traverse in sapping.\r\n\r\n=Chanderee=, or =Chandhaire=. A town of India in the province of Malwa.\r\nIts fortress, formerly deemed impregnable, consists of a strong rampart\r\nof sandstone flanked by circular towers, and is situated on a high hill.\r\nDuring the native wars, being a place of importance, it was frequently\r\nbesieged.\r\n\r\n=Chandernagore.= The principal settlement of the French in Bengal, which\r\nis encompassed by the British district of Hooghly. In 1757 this\r\nsettlement was taken by the British, but restored in 1763. In 1793 it\r\nwas again taken by the British, but restored to the French a second time\r\nin 1816.\r\n\r\n=Chandore.= A fortified town of British India, 130 miles northwest from\r\nBombay. In 1804 and 1818 this place capitulated to the British.\r\n\r\n=Chantier= (_Fr._). A square piece of wood, which is used for the\r\npurpose of raising anything. It serves to place barrels of gunpowder in\r\na proper manner, and frequently to try pieces of ordnance instead of\r\nframes.\r\n\r\n=Chantilly.= A post-village of Fairfax Co., Va. Here, on September 1,\r\n1862, the Confederate troops of Gen. Lee attacked a part of Gen. Pope’s\r\narmy, under Gens. Reno, Stevens, and Kearney, and a severe conflict\r\nensued, lasting into the night, and resulting in the death of Gens.\r\nStevens and Kearney.\r\n\r\n=Chape.= The metallic part put on the end of a scabbard, to prevent the\r\npoint of the sword or bayonet from piercing through it.\r\n\r\n=Chapeau.= In a military sense, a hat, cap, or other head-covering.\r\n\r\n=Chapeau Bras.= A military hat which can be flattened and put under the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n=Chaperon.= A hood or cape worn by Knights of the Garter.\r\n\r\n=Chaplain.= A clergyman with a military commission, giving him the\r\nspiritual charge of soldiers. There are 30 post and 4 regimental\r\nchaplains in the U. S. army.\r\n\r\n=Chaplain-General.= In the British service, the officer at the head of\r\nthe chaplain’s department.\r\n\r\n=Chaplet.= In heraldry, is always composed of four roses, the other\r\nparts being leaves.\r\n\r\n=Chappe= (_Fr._). A barrel containing another barrel, which holds\r\ngunpowder. It likewise means a composition of earth, horse-dung, and\r\nwad, that covers the mouth of a cannon or mortar.\r\n\r\n=Chapultepec.= A strong fortress of Mexico, situated about 2 miles\r\nsouthwest of the metropolis. It consists of an eminence rising to the\r\nheight of about 150 feet, with a strong castle on top. During the\r\nMexican war it was deemed necessary by Gen. Scott, for strategic\r\nreasons, to capture this last outward defense of the capital prior to\r\nthe attack on the city itself. This was gallantly effected on September\r\n13, 1847, and next day the city was entered by the American forces, thus\r\nvirtually ending the war. Preparations for the assault were commenced on\r\nthe night of September 11, and before the evening of the 12th, owing to\r\nthe skillful arrangement of Gen. Scott’s artillery, the exterior\r\ndefenses began to give way. Next day was determined on for the attack.\r\nThe American forces were so placed that the assault could be made\r\nsimultaneously from different sides at a preconcerted signal, which\r\nwould be the temporary cessation of the cannonade from their batteries.\r\nIt was given, and the attacking forces advanced, Gen. Quitman’s division\r\nfrom the south, and Gen. Pillow from the wooded slope on the west, Gen.\r\nSmith’s brigade supporting Quitman, Pillow supported by the division of\r\nGen. Worth, and the batteries throwing shells into the fort over the\r\nheads of their friends. Under a heavy fire of musketry the attacking\r\nforces advance, and step by step they gain every disputed point,\r\nscaling-ladders are brought into requisition, an entrance effected, and\r\nthe defeated Mexicans, dislodged and retreating, are pursued to the very\r\ngates of their capital. The American loss during the three days was 833\r\nkilled and wounded.\r\n\r\n=Charcoal.= One of the ingredients of gunpowder. It is made by\r\ndistilling small sticks of wood in closed retorts. Willow, alder,\r\npoplar, and dogwood are some of the woods used. In distilling the heat\r\nshould be kept below redness. Charcoal should be light in weight, and\r\nhave a velvety fracture. It inflames at about 460° Fahr. Its\r\ncomposition and properties vary with the nature of the wood and mode of\r\ndistillation employed.\r\n\r\nCharcoal obtained from light wood is the best for gunpowder, as it is\r\nmore combustible and easy to pulverize, and contains less earthy\r\nmatters. Willow and poplar are used for this purpose in the United\r\nStates and black elder in Europe. The wood must be sound and should not\r\nbe more than 3 or 4 years old, and about 1 inch in diameter; branches\r\nlarger than this should be split up. It is cut in the spring when the\r\nsap runs freely, and is immediately stripped of its bark. The smaller\r\nbranches are used for fine sporting powder.\r\n\r\nThe operation of charring may be performed in pits, but the method now\r\nalmost universally used in making charcoal for gunpowder is that of\r\n_distillation_. For this purpose the wood is placed in an iron vessel,\r\ngenerally of a cylindrical form, to which a cover is luted; an opening\r\nwith a pipe is made to conduct off the gaseous products, and the wood is\r\nthus exposed to the heat of a furnace. The progress of distillation is\r\njudged of by the color of the flame and smoke, and sometimes by\r\n_test-sticks_, which are introduced through tubes prepared for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n_Properties._--The charcoal thus obtained should retain a certain degree\r\nof elasticity, and should have a brown color, the wood not being\r\nentirely decomposed. As it readily absorbs one-twentieth of its weight\r\nof moisture, which diminishes its inflammability, it should be made only\r\nin proportion as it is required for use. Wood generally contains 52 per\r\ncent. of carbon, but distillation furnishes not more than 30 to 40 per\r\ncent. of charcoal.\r\n\r\nAs it is desirable to have charcoal for gunpowder very combustible, it\r\nmust be prepared at a low temperature, and must be light.\r\n\r\n_Accidents._--When recently prepared charcoal is pulverized and laid in\r\nheaps, it is liable to absorb oxygen with such rapidity as to cause\r\nspontaneous combustion. This has been the cause of serious accidents at\r\npowder-mills, and hence it is important not to pulverize charcoal until\r\nit has been exposed to the air for several days. When charcoal has not\r\nabsorbed moisture, and is mixed with oxidizing substances, it may be\r\ninflamed by violent shocks or by friction. This is the principal cause\r\nof the accidents which occur in the preparation of explosive mixtures\r\nwhich contain charcoal. See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Chard.= A town of England, in Somersetshire. Here the royalists were\r\ndefeated in the civil wars between Charles I. and the Parliament.\r\n\r\n=Charenton.= A town of France, in the department of the Seine. It stands\r\non the Marne, over which there is a bridge, which was frequently the\r\nscene of bloody conflicts between the citizens and the soldiers during\r\nthe French revolutions. It now forms a portion of the fortifications of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n=Charge.= The act of rushing on the enemy with a view to come to close\r\nfighting. It is also sometimes applied to the temporary command of a\r\ndetachment, troop, company, or battery. A charge likewise means the\r\nstatement of the crime for which an officer or soldier is brought before\r\na court-martial.\r\n\r\n=Charge.= The quantity of powder with which a piece of artillery is\r\nloaded. The charge corresponding to the maximum velocity in the\r\nprojectile is called the _maximum charge_. The longer the gun the\r\ngreater the maximum charge. In the early days of artillery, when powder\r\nwas used in the form of _dust_, a very large charge was necessary. After\r\nthe introduction of grained powder it was reduced gradually to about\r\none-fourth the weight of the shot. At the time of the recent departures\r\nin ordnance, the charge for smooth-bore guns was from one-fifth to\r\none-eighth the weight of the projectile; for howitzers, from one-eighth\r\nto one-twentieth; for mortars the charge varied with the range, the\r\nlargest being about one-ninth. For rifle guns the disproportion was\r\ngreater than for smooth-bores, the average being about one-tenth. In\r\nsmall-arms, the charge for the old smooth-bore musket was about\r\none-third the weight of the ball. When the rifle was introduced, this\r\nproportion was retained till the oblong bullet began to be used, when\r\nthe charge was relatively much diminished, till it fell to about\r\none-tenth. The tendency lately has been to increase it. In some of the\r\nbest-known rifles of the present day the charge is about one-fifth,--a\r\nmajority use more than one-sixth. The same tendency is still more\r\nobservable in heavy ordnance. The largest _Krupp_, _Woolwich_, and\r\n_Armstrong_ guns use a charge greater than _one-fourth_ the weight of\r\nthe projectile.\r\n\r\n=Charge.= The position of a weapon fitted for attack; as, to bring a\r\nweapon to the charge.\r\n\r\n=Charge.= In heraldry, the figures represented on a shield are called\r\ncharges, and a shield with figures upon it is said to be charged. The\r\ncharges in a shield ought to be few in number, and strongly marked, both\r\nas regards their character and the mode of their representation. The\r\nfamily shield belonging to the head of the house almost always is\r\nsimpler,--_i.e._, has fewer charges than the shields of collaterals, or\r\neven of junior members.\r\n\r\n=Charger= (Fr. _cheval de bataille_). A horse kept by an officer for\r\nmilitary purposes.\r\n\r\n=Chariot.= In antiquity, a war car or vehicle.\r\n\r\n=Charleroi.= A strongly fortified town of Belgium, in Hainaut. This\r\nplace was fortified by Vauban. Several great battles have been fought\r\nnear this town, especially in 1690 and 1794. Charleroi was besieged by\r\nthe Prince of Orange, 1672 and 1677; but he was soon obliged to retire.\r\nNear here, at Ligny, Napoleon attacked the Prussian line, making it fall\r\nback upon Wavres, June 16, 1815.\r\n\r\n=Charleston.= A port of entry and the chief city of South Carolina,\r\nfounded in 1672. On Sullivan’s Island, about 7 miles below,\r\ncommunicating with the harbor, a garrison of about 400 Americans under\r\nCol. Moultrie sustained an assault from 9 British ships of war, and\r\ngallantly repulsed them, on June 28, 1776. The city was afterwards\r\nbesieged, and after a gallant resistance of nearly six weeks surrendered\r\nto the British, May 12, 1780, being held by them till 1782. In the civil\r\nwar (1861-65) it was here the first gun was fired, which resulted in the\r\nreduction of the famous Fort Sumter. In the latter part of the war it\r\nwas bombarded and besieged by the Federal troops. Its evacuation by the\r\nConfederates and its occupation by the Federals followed, February 18,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n=Chase.= In gunnery, is the conical part of the gun in front of the\r\nreinforce.\r\n\r\n=Chase-ring.= In gunnery, is a band at the front end of the chase.\r\n\r\n=Chassepot.= A species of rifle. See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Chasseurs.= A French word signifying “hunters,” applied in various\r\nforms to light troops in the French service, organized at different\r\ntimes, either as infantry or cavalry, as _chasseurs à pied_, _de\r\nMontague_, _de Vincennes_, for infantry, and _chasseurs à cheval_,\r\n_d’Afrique_, _Algeriens_, etc., for cavalry. They have organizations in\r\nother armies also corresponding to these, such as the _jägers_ in the\r\nAustrian army, and the _cacciatore dei Alpi_ of the Garibaldian troops\r\nin the Italian war of 1859-60.\r\n\r\n=Chassis.= A traversing frame or movable railway, along which the\r\ncarriage of a heavy gun in barbette, or casemate, moves backward and\r\nforward in action.

It served to protect\r\nthe besiegers in their approach to the walls. This invention was formed\r\nby the soldiers placing their shields over their heads, in a sloping\r\nposition, similar to the tiles of a house. The first rank stood erect,\r\nthe second stooped a little, the third still more, and the last rank\r\nknelt.

Henry IV.\r\nplaced it under the charge of the marshals and colonels of France, and\r\nby means of it many of those who had served their country faithfully\r\nwere enabled to spend the latter portion of their lives in peace and\r\nabove want. The order formed the germ of that noble hospital, the\r\n_Invalides_, which was founded by Louis XIV., and which served as a\r\nmodel for the English hospitals of Greenwich and Chelsea. On the\r\nfounding of the hospital the order was superseded.\r\n\r\n=Christiansand.= A fortified seaport of Norway, and capital of a\r\ngovernment of the same name. This place was founded in 1641 by Christian\r\nIV., and was taken by the British in 1807.\r\n\r\n=Christ, Order of.= When the Templars were expelled from France, and\r\ntheir property confiscated by Philippe le Bel, they were received into\r\nPortugal, and their order revived there in 1317 under this title. Noble\r\ndescent and three years’ military service against the infidel were\r\nrequired for admission.\r\n\r\n=Chrome Steel.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR.\r\n\r\n=Chronograph.= See CHRONOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n=Chronoscope.= An instrument for measuring minute intervals of time. The\r\nterm is specially applied by military men to instruments for obtaining\r\ninitial velocities. The _gun-pendulum_ and _ballistic-pendulum_ were\r\nformerly used for this purpose, but are now nearly obsolete. All modern\r\nchronoscopes use electricity as a transmitting agent. The general method\r\nof applying it is to have the current-bearing wires pass through two\r\ntargets placed in the path of the projectile. These wires are cut by the\r\nprojectile, and the interval between the successive ruptures is recorded\r\nby a delicate time-keeper. Knowing the distance between the targets, the\r\nvelocity is obtained by dividing this space, expressed in feet, by the\r\nnumber of seconds in the interval. Chronoscopes differ in the kind of\r\ntime-keeper employed. One of the largest classes of chronoscopes use the\r\npendulum.\r\n\r\nThe _electro-ballistic machine_ of Col. Benton (U. S. Ordnance\r\nDepartment) may be taken as a type of this class. It consists of two\r\npendulums having equal times of vibration suspended from the same\r\nhorizontal axis. When the pendulums are deflected, one to the right the\r\nother to the left, through angles of 90°, pieces of soft iron attached\r\nto them come in contact with electro-magnets, which serve to hold them\r\nup. Each of these magnets is excited by a current passing through one of\r\nthe targets. When the targets are ruptured the pendulums fall, and in\r\npassing each other record the point of meeting by operating a delicate\r\nbent lever attached to one of them, which leaves a dot of ink on the arc\r\nin front of which the pendulums vibrate. The _interval of time_ between\r\nthe rupture of the two targets is obtained from a table of arcs and\r\ncorresponding times. Col. Benton has also invented an instrument called\r\n_velocimeter_, in which he uses threads instead of electro-magnets to\r\nhold up the pendulums. The threads pass through the targets, and when\r\nthey are cut the pendulums fall as before. This method has found\r\nconsiderable favor where great accuracy is not required.\r\n\r\n_Schultz’s chronoscope_ uses as a time-keeper a tuning-fork, which, in\r\nits vibrations, traces a waved line upon a revolving cylinder. The\r\nrupture of each of the targets is recorded by an electric spark\r\ndeposited on the cylinder near the waved line. The number of waves\r\nbetween the spark spots gives the _interval of time_ when the _period of\r\nvibration_ or _tarage_ of the fork is known. The vibration of the fork\r\nis sustained by electro-magnets, which alternately attract and release\r\nthe branches, an interrupter being placed in the circuit. When the\r\ncurrent passing through the targets is broken an induced current is\r\ngenerated, which deposits the spark on the cylinder in leaping a short\r\nbreak in the circuit. When the first target is broken, by an ingenious\r\ncontrivance the current is made through the second target before the\r\nshot reaches it. The _tarage_ of the fork is obtained by placing a\r\nsecond’s pendulum in the target current, which ruptures the current in\r\neach vibration, and produces a series of spark spots on the cylinder.\r\nThe number of waves between successive spots gives the number of\r\nvibrations to the second.\r\n\r\n_Boulanger’s chronograph_ is the simplest of all chronoscopes. It uses a\r\nrod held up vertically by a magnet, which is excited by a current\r\nthrough the first target. The current through the second target, when\r\nbroken, releases a spring knife-blade, which, moving sideways, marks the\r\nrod in its fall. The _interval of time_ is obtained from the distance\r\nthrough which the rod has fallen, as shown by the position of the mark.\r\nThe end of the scale is marked when both currents are simultaneously\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n=Chrystler’s=, or =Chrysler’s Field, Battle of=. The name of an\r\nengagement which took place at Chrystler’s farm, on the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver, November 11, 1813, between the American forces under Gen. Boyd\r\nand the British troops under Lieut.-Col. Morrison, in which neither\r\nparty gained a victory, but the advantage was with the British.\r\n\r\n=Chunar, Treaty of.= Concluded between the nabob of Oude and Governor\r\nHastings, by which the nabob was relieved of his debts to the East\r\nIndia Company, on condition of his seizing the property of the begums,\r\nhis mother and grandmother, and delivering it up to the English,\r\nSeptember 19, 1781.\r\n\r\n=Churubusco.= A village or hamlet of Mexico, on the Rio de Churubusco,\r\nabout 6 miles south of the city of Mexico.

The entire\r\nMexican army was dispersed, their ancient capital captured, and an\r\nhonorable peace ensued.\r\n\r\n=Chusan.= One of a group of islands off the east coast of China. This\r\nisland, called the “key of China,” was taken by the British in 1840 and\r\n1841, and held by them until the terms of their treaty with China were\r\nfulfilled by the latter power.\r\n\r\n=Cimbres.= A chain of mountains in Mexico. On April 28, 1862, the\r\nadvance-guard of the French, commanded by Gen. Count de Lorencez,\r\nencountered and defeated in a defile of this chain a Mexican force 6000\r\nstrong under Gen.

The 62d Article of War provides that “If upon marches,\r\nguards, or in quarters, different corps of the army shall happen to\r\njoin, or to do duty together, the officer highest in rank of the _line_\r\nof the army, marine corps, or militia, by commission there, on duty, or\r\nin quarters, shall command the whole and give orders for what is needful\r\nto the service, unless otherwise specially directed by the President of\r\nthe United States, according to the nature of the case.” The\r\ninterpretation of this act has long been a subject of controversy. The\r\ndifficulty arises from the vague and uncertain meaning of the words\r\n“line of the army,” which neither in the English service nor in our own\r\nhave a well-defined and invariable meaning. By some they are understood\r\nto designate the regular army as distinguished from the militia; by\r\nothers as meant to discriminate between officers by ordinary commissions\r\nand those by brevet; and finally, by others, to designate an officer not\r\nbelonging to the staff.\r\n\r\nThe President states that “He has maturely considered the question, and\r\nfinds himself compelled to differ from some for whose opinions he\r\nentertains a very high respect. His opinion is, that although these\r\nwords may sometimes be used in a different sense (to be determined by\r\nthe context and subject-matter), in the 62d Article of War they are used\r\nto designate those officers of the army who do not belong to the staff,\r\nin contradistinction to those who do, and that the article intended, in\r\nthe case contemplated by it, to confer the command exclusively on the\r\nformer.” In the discussion which took place in 1828 relating to ordinary\r\nrank and rank by brevet, the then Secretary of War (Gen. Porter) says,\r\n“Rank in the line of the army or lineal rank, as understood by the\r\nPresident, is applicable to the existing organization of that portion\r\nonly of the army which is intended for field operations or the exertion\r\nof physical force against an enemy. It is commonly used in\r\ncontradistinction to the staff,” etc. He then goes on to show that in\r\nthe 62d Article it has another meaning,--House Document 58, 20th\r\nCongress, 2d session, page 13. In the same discussion, Mr. Drayton, as\r\nchairman of the Committee on Military Affairs of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, expresses the same opinion. He says, “Rank in the\r\n_line_ of the army is conceived to be rank in a military body specially\r\norganized for the exertion of physical force, or in other words, for\r\ncombating an enemy; and an officer in such a body has a direct and\r\nparamount command over the troops which compose it. The expressions\r\n‘rank in the line of the army,’ ‘rank in the line,’ ‘lineal rank,’ _are\r\ngenerally used in contradistinction to staff appointments_.” He adds,\r\n“and to rank which confers upon officers only an occasional right to\r\ncommand, including brevet officers,” etc. Thus we see that these\r\ngentlemen admit that these words, in their proper and usual\r\nsignification, are employed to distinguish the combatant from the staff\r\nor non-combatant portions of the army.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the policy of the law, we can discover no reasons of\r\nexpediency which compel us to depart from the plain and ordinary import\r\nof the terms; on the contrary, we may suppose strong reasons why it may\r\nhave been deemed proper, in the case referred to by the article, to\r\nexclude officers of the staff from command. In the first place, the\r\ncommand of troops might frequently interfere with their appropriate\r\nduties, and thereby occasion serious embarrassment to the service. In\r\nthe next place, the officers of some of the staff corps are not\r\nqualified by their habits of education for the command of troops, and\r\nalthough others are so qualified, it arises from the fact that (by laws\r\npassed long subsequently to the article in question) the officers of the\r\ncorps to which they belong are required to be appointed from the “line\r\nof the army.” Lastly, officers of the staff corps seldom have troops of\r\ntheir own corps serving under their command, and if the words “officers\r\nof the line” are understood to apply to them, the effect would often be\r\nto give them command over the officers and men of all the other corps\r\nwhen not a man of their own was present, an anomaly always to be\r\navoided, where it is possible to do so. Whatever doubts may be\r\nentertained on this subject in regard to the officers of other staff\r\ncorps, none can exist in regard to those of the Medical Department and\r\nthe Pay Department. The law of 1847 expressly excludes them from\r\ncommand. Now the officers of these corps are not a distinct and\r\nindependent body, but are a part of the army, and as they cannot\r\ncommand, it follows that when on duty they must be commanded.\r\n\r\n=Commandant.= An officer who has the command of a garrison, fort,\r\ncastle, regiment, company, etc.; called also commander.\r\n\r\n=Commander-in-Chief.= The title given to the officer who has supreme\r\ncommand of the land or naval forces of a nation. The President is _ex\r\nofficio_ commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.\r\n\r\n=Commands.= In the military service there are two kinds, the\r\n_preparatory command_, such as _forward_, which indicates the movement\r\nthat is to be executed, and the _command of execution_, such as MARCH,\r\nor HALT, or in the manual of arms, the part of the command which causes\r\nthe execution. The tone of command is animated, distinct, and of a\r\nloudness proportioned to the number of men under instruction.\r\n\r\nEach _preparatory command_ is pronounced in an ascending tone of voice,\r\nbut always in such a manner that the _command of execution_ may be more\r\nenergetic and elevated.\r\n\r\nThe _command of execution_ is pronounced in a tone firm and brief. The\r\ntrumpet ought to be used for giving commands whenever it can be done to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n=Commilitones.= This word had with the Romans the same significance as\r\nthe English words _comrade soldiers_.\r\n\r\n=Commissariat.= A name given to the organized system whereby armies are\r\nprovided with food and daily necessaries. In the old Roman armies the\r\nduty of supplying troops was performed by the _quæstors_, who filled the\r\nplace of the commissary officers of our own times. In the U. S. service\r\nthis department is under charge of an officer of the rank of\r\nbrigadier-general, called the commissary-general of subsistence.\r\n\r\n=Commissary.= In general means any one to whom the power or authority of\r\nanother is committed; used in military affairs in relation to officers\r\nwho have charge of the subsistence of troops, musters, etc.\r\n\r\n=Commissary of Muster.= See MUSTER.\r\n\r\n=Commissary Sergeants.= In the U. S. service, are sergeants who are\r\nselected from the line of the army, by the Secretary of War; they must\r\nbe steady and reliable men, and their duties are to assist the\r\ncommissary officer in receiving, storing, preserving, issuing, selling,\r\nand accounting for the subsistence supplies at their posts, according to\r\nthe regulations for the subsistence departments.\r\n\r\n=Commission.= A writing, generally in the form of a warrant or\r\nletters-patent, authorizing the performance of duties, or exercise of\r\npowers belonging to another. Instruments bearing this title are issued\r\nby the Executive to officers in the army or navy, who, on confirmation\r\nof their appointment, are known as _commissioned_ officers. The practice\r\nof buying and selling all commissions under the rank of colonel, which\r\nformerly prevailed in the British army, was abolished in 1871.\r\n\r\n=Commissioned.= One having a commission; furnished with a commission;\r\nempowered or authorized to act; as, a commissioned officer.\r\n\r\n=Common Time.= In marching, the length of the direct step in common time\r\nis 28 inches, and the cadence is at the rate of 90 steps per minute.\r\n\r\n=Communication, Line of.= A fantastical name applied by Belidor to mines\r\nwith immense charges, which he proposed to use for the destruction of\r\ncountermines, and which were used successfully in the attack of\r\nSchweidnitz, under Frederick II.\r\n\r\n=Commutation.= Is the conversion of allowances, such as fuel, forage,\r\nand quarters, into their money value.\r\n\r\n=Comorn.= A royal free town of Hungary, 48 miles from Buda. Its citadel\r\nis considered one of the strongest in Europe. Its works and\r\nintrenchments extend about 7 miles along the banks of the rivers (Waag\r\nand Danube), and it requires for its defense at least 15,000 men and 400\r\npieces of artillery. It has the reputation of being impregnable, and\r\njustified it in the Hungarian war, for the Austrians besieged it from\r\nOctober, 1848, to September, 1849, and only became masters of it at last\r\nin virtue of a capitulation.\r\n\r\n=Compagnies de Discipline= (_Fr._). “Companies of discipline.” These\r\ncompanies were created by Napoleon I. in 1802; the basis of their actual\r\norganization was laid by a royal order, dated April 1, 1818. This order\r\nfixes the number of companies at 10, 6 of fusileers and 4 of pioneers,\r\nthe former to be composed of soldiers of the army who were guilty of\r\nindiscipline, and the latter to be formed of men of the former who were\r\ndeemed incorrigible. The number of companies is now reduced to 7, who\r\nare stationed in Algeria. There are also 4 companies similarly organized\r\nwhich are stationed in the French colonies.\r\n\r\n=Compagnies d’Ordonnance= (_Fr._). The name of a corps of cavalry, which\r\nwas organized in France by Charles VII. in 1439; it numbered 16\r\ncompanies, and the entire strength was 9600 men. This was the first\r\nregular cavalry organized in France.\r\n\r\n=Company= (Fr. _compagnie_). In military organization, is a body of men\r\ncommanded by a captain, and forming an aliquot part of a regiment or\r\nbattalion. In the British service a full company consists of about 100\r\nmen, and a regiment of infantry generally comprises 10 or 12 companies,\r\nor if there is more than 1 battalion, each has this number of companies.\r\nThe captain of each company is assisted by 2 subalterns. In the U. S.\r\narmy each regiment of infantry is divided into 10 companies, and each\r\ncompany has a captain and 2 lieutenants. The artillery and cavalry\r\nregiments are divided into 12 companies each, and the former has a\r\ncaptain and 4 lieutenants to each company. See ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n=Company Column.= The successive improvements that have been made in\r\nfire-arms during the last hundred years have been followed by a gradual\r\ndiminution of the depth of tactical formations, until to-day the “open\r\norder,” or the formation as skirmishers, is the only one adopted under\r\nthe fire of the enemy. In the most recent development of the “open\r\norder” the company, composed of 250 men, is recognized as the “fighting\r\nunit,” while the battalion, composed of 4 companies, is regarded as the\r\n“tactical unit,”--that is, the smallest body of men that can be safely\r\nemployed independently.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of breech-loaders has not changed the principles of\r\nstrategy and grand tactics, nor has it diminished the number of lines in\r\nwhich armies are drawn up to give and receive battle. It has simply\r\ndemonstrated the impossibility of attacking positions in battalion\r\ncolumns, and, as a consequence, has necessitated a division of the\r\ntroops into smaller fractions, which, under fire, can be moved with the\r\ngreatest rapidity and least exposure, thereby insuring the least loss of\r\nlife. Hence the formation of troops in “company column” in the German\r\nand other European armies.\r\n\r\nIn the German army, the company is formed in three ranks; the tallest\r\nmen are in the front rank; the most adroit and best shots are selected\r\nfor the third rank, because the special duties of this rank require\r\nthese qualities; the distance between ranks is 2 feet. The company is\r\ndivided into divisions (or platoons). If the divisions consist of 20 or\r\nmore files, they are divided into subdivisions (or half platoons); the\r\nsubdivisions are again divided into sections of not less than 4, nor\r\nmore than 6 files. If the company be of full strength, it will have a\r\nfront of 72 files; each division will contain 36 files; each subdivision\r\n18 files; and each section 6 files. The battalion consists of 4\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nThe “company column” is formed in the following manner: The battalion\r\nbeing in line, at the command to “form company column,” the third rank\r\nof each even division of the right wing faces about, marches 12 paces to\r\nthe rear, halts, and faces to the front; the first and second ranks of\r\nthe uneven divisions face to the left, and place themselves 6 paces in\r\nrear of the first and second ranks of the even divisions; the third rank\r\nof the uneven subdivisions faces to the left, and, filing in front of\r\nthe third rank of the even division, forms with it a third division in\r\ndouble rank. The movement is executed in the uncadenced step. The column\r\nwhen formed consists practically of 3 platoons in double rank. In the\r\nleft wing the movement is similarly executed; the even subdivisions\r\nploying in rear of the uneven subdivisions. The third division of each\r\ncolumn is called the “shooting division.”\r\n\r\nIn the French army the company is formed in 2 ranks, and is normally\r\ndivided into 4 sections, the first two of which constitute the first\r\nplatoon, the last two the second platoon. The “company column” is always\r\nformed on the second section from the right, which stands fast; the\r\ndistance between sections is 6 paces.\r\n\r\nThe “company column” in Italy, Austria, and Russia, as in France, varies\r\nvery slightly from the German.\r\n\r\nWith a battalion of 8 or 10 companies, subdivisions may be dispensed\r\nwith, and, so long as this organization is retained in England and\r\nAmerica, the “company column” will not therefore become a necessity.\r\nShould the regimental system of 3 battalions, of 4 companies each, be\r\nadopted, all of the advantages claimed for the “company column”\r\ncan be secured by adopting the double column of fours for each\r\ncompany.--_Armies of Asia and Europe_, UPTON.\r\n\r\n=Compass, Prismatic.= A pocket instrument for measuring horizontal\r\nangles by means of the magnetic meridian. It is much employed in the\r\nmilitary service for sketching the general features of a country, and in\r\nreconnoissances. It consists of a small glass-covered box containing a\r\nmagnetized needle attached to a graduated card. A sight-vane with a fine\r\nwire stretched longitudinally in the slot is hinged to one side of the\r\nbox. On the opposite side is a prism. To use it the sight-vane is turned\r\nup to the perpendicular. The eye is applied to the prism, and the wire\r\ndirected on the object. The division in the card coinciding with the\r\nreflection of the wire gives the angle with the meridian.\r\n\r\n=Compassionate Allowances.= In the British service, are grants of\r\nallowances which are made to the legitimate children of deceased\r\nofficers of the land forces in all cases in which the widow of the\r\nofficer would be entitled to be placed on the pension-list, provided it\r\nbe shown that they are deserving objects of the sovereign’s bounty, and\r\nare in distressed circumstances.\r\n\r\n=Compiègne.= A town of France, department of Oise. It was besieged by\r\nthe English in 1430, who failed to capture it owing to the brave defense\r\nmade by its governor, Flavia. Joan of Arc, who came to the assistance of\r\nthis town, was taken prisoner by the English besiegers. The emperor\r\nNapoleon III. and the king of Prussia met here on October 6, 1861.\r\n\r\n=Complement of the Curtain.= That part in the interior side of a\r\nfortification which makes the demi-gorge.\r\n\r\n=Complement of the Line of Defense.= The remainder of the line of\r\ndefense after the angle of the flank is taken away.\r\n\r\n=Compliment.= The military mark of respect shown by a body of troops to\r\nofficial personages, to an officer, or to another body of troops.\r\n\r\n=Compositions, Pyrotechnic.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Compound Armor.= See ARMOR PLATES.\r\n\r\n=Compression Strain.= See ORDNANCE, STRAINS UPON.\r\n\r\n=Compulsion=, or =Inevitable Necessity=. Is a constraint upon the will\r\nwhereby an officer is urged to that which his judgment disapproves, and\r\nwhich, it is to be presumed, his will (if left to itself) would reject.\r\nAs punishments are, therefore, only inflicted for the abuse of that free\r\nwill which God has given to man, it is highly just and equitable that an\r\nofficer should be excused for those acts which are done through\r\nunavoidable force and compulsion.\r\n\r\n=Comrade.= A soldier who acts as the friend of another soldier,\r\nrendering him friendly services, etc. Each soldier generally has one\r\nspecial friend who is recognized as his comrade. The term comrade is\r\nalso extended so as to include all the members of a particular corps,\r\nbranch of the service, or the army generally.\r\n\r\n=Concarneau.= A maritime town of France, department of Finistère; it was\r\ntaken by Du Guesclin in 1373, and by the Leaguers in 1576. The town is\r\ndefended by a fort and surrounded by ancient walls.\r\n\r\n=Concave Order of Battle.= See ORDER OF BATTLE, CONCAVE.\r\n\r\n=Concepcion.= A port of Chili, capital of a province of the same name.\r\nIn 1554, 1555, and 1603, it was taken and burnt by the Araucanians. A\r\nportion of it was again devastated by the Araucanians in 1823.\r\n\r\n=Concord.= A town of Middlesex Co., Mass., 11 miles from Boston. Here,\r\non April 19, 1775, one of the first conflicts took place between the\r\nAmericans and the British troops. A monument is erected at this place to\r\ncommemorate the event.\r\n\r\n=Concrete.= A coarse building mortar, containing broken stone, gravel,\r\netc., used much in fortifications.\r\n\r\n=Condé.= A town of France, in the department of the North. It is\r\nstrongly fortified and has a military arsenal. In 1793 this town was\r\ntaken by the Austrians.\r\n\r\n=Condemned Property.= In the military service, property must be\r\ncondemned by an inspector before it can rightfully be destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Condottieri.= A name given in the 14th century to the leaders of\r\ncertain bands of military adventurers in Italy, who, for booty, offered\r\ntheir services to any party in any contest, and often practiced warfare\r\non their own account purely for the sake of plunder. The _Compagnies\r\nGrandes_ in France at about the same period were somewhat similar to the\r\ncondottieri, and were so powerful at one time that in 1361 they routed\r\nthe king’s forces at Brignais, and slew Jacques de Bourbon, constable of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n=Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and a Gentleman.= See UNGENTLEMANLIKE OR\r\nUNOFFICERLIKE, and APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 60 and 61.\r\n\r\n=Confederate Projectiles.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Confederate States of America=, or =Southern Confederacy=. The efforts\r\nof the Southern States for the extension of slavery, and the zeal of the\r\nNorthern States for its abolition, with the consequent political\r\ndissensions, led to the great secession of 1860-61. On November 4, 1860,\r\nAbraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate, was elected President of the\r\nUnited States. Hitherto, a President in the interest of the South had\r\nbeen elected. On December 20, South Carolina seceded from the Union; and\r\nAlabama, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia\r\n(except West Virginia), Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina seceded\r\nearly in 1861. Jefferson Davis was inaugurated President of the Southern\r\nConfederacy at Montgomery, Ala., February 18, 1861. For important events\r\nof the civil war which ensued, see the different States of America\r\nthroughout this work, and the names of battles, etc., which were fought\r\nduring this war. On the 20th day of August, 1866, the President (Andrew\r\nJohnson) proclaimed the insurrection at an end, and that peace, order,\r\ntranquillity, and civil authority existed throughout the whole of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n=Confederation of the Rhine.= The league of the German states, formed by\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte, July 12, 1806, when he abolished the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire, and the emperor of Germany became emperor of Austria. In\r\nDecember it consisted of France, Bavaria, Würtemberg, Saxony, and\r\nWestphalia; 7 grand duchies, 6 duchies, and 20 principalities. The\r\nprinces collectively engaged to raise 258,000 troops to serve in case of\r\nwar, and established a diet at Frankfort. This league terminated with\r\nthe career of Bonaparte in 1814. It was replaced by the _Germanic\r\nConfederation_, and it, in its turn, was replaced by the _North German\r\nConfederation_.\r\n\r\n=Confiscation.= The appropriation to the public use of private property.\r\nA right which is conferred under certain circumstances by the laws of\r\nwar. See CONTRABAND OF WAR.\r\n\r\n=Conflans= (near Paris), =Treaty of=. Between Louis XI. of France and\r\nthe Dukes of Bourbon, Brittany, and Burgundy, October 5, 1465. By its\r\nprovisions Normandy was ceded to the Duke of Berry, and an end was put\r\nto the “War of the Public Good.” It was confirmed by the treaty of\r\nPeronne, 1468.\r\n\r\n=Congreve Rocket.= See ROCKET.\r\n\r\n=Coni=, or =Cuneo=. The capital of a province of the same name in\r\nPiedmont. It was once a fortified place, and had to undergo several\r\nsieges. After being taken and retaken, the victory of Marengo gave it\r\ninto the hands of the French, who demolished the fortifications and\r\nturned them into promenades.\r\n\r\n=Connecticut.= One of the original States of the American Confederation,\r\nand the most southwestern of the New England States. The country was\r\nearly explored by the Dutch, but the first permanent settlements were\r\nmade by English emigrants in 1634. In 1637 the settlers were much\r\nannoyed by Indians, who were shortly afterwards subdued, however, in\r\nengagements at Mystic and Fairfield, and never after gave any serious\r\ntrouble. The State took an active part in the cause of American\r\nindependence, and also in the late war for the Union, and throughout\r\nboth these eventful contests she sustained eminent distinction as well\r\nfor the wisdom of her statesmen as for the bravery and patriotism of her\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n=Conquer.= To gain or acquire by force; to take possession of by violent\r\nmeans; to gain dominion over; to subdue; to reduce, etc. To gain the\r\nvictory; to overcome.\r\n\r\n=Conqueror.= One who conquers; one who subdues and brings into\r\nsubjection or possession by force or by influence.\r\n\r\n=Conquest.= The act of conquering or acquiring by force; the act of\r\novercoming or subduing opposition by force; subjugation; victory.\r\n\r\n=Conquisitores.= So were called the recruiting officers of the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Consarbruck.= A village of Rhenish Prussia where the French were\r\ndefeated by the Duc de Lorraine, August 11, 1675.\r\n\r\n=Conscription.= A system of enrolling men for military service, which is\r\nin vogue in France and some other foreign countries. Voluntary\r\nenlistments being so very few, the compulsory system of keeping up the\r\narmies is deemed indispensable. An account is kept of all the youths who\r\nreach the age of 20 in one year, and out of these the number required\r\nfor the army is drawn by lot.\r\n\r\n=Consigne= (_Fr._). Parole or countersign.\r\n\r\n=Constable.= The title in the Middle Ages of the highest military\r\nofficer in France under the king. The term comes from the low Latin\r\nphrase _comes stabuli_, count of the stables.\r\n\r\n=Constable of the Tower.= In England, is a general officer who has the\r\nchief superintendence of the Tower, and is lord-lieutenant of the Tower\r\nHamlets. He holds his appointment by letters-patent from the sovereign,\r\nand is not removable at pleasure.\r\n\r\n=Constantine=, or =Constantina=. A fortified city of Algeria, capital of\r\na province of its own name. It stands on the site of the ancient Cirta,\r\ncelebrated as the bulwark of Numidia. It is built upon a high rock,\r\nformed into a species of peninsula by the Rummel. It was besieged by the\r\nFrench in 1836, but held out till October, 1837, when it was taken by\r\nassault.\r\n\r\n=Constantinople.= A celebrated city of Turkey in Europe, the capital of\r\nthe Ottoman empire. It was formerly called _Byzantium_, but having been\r\nrebuilt by the emperor Constantine in 328, it received his name. No\r\ncity in the world has been subjected to as many numerous and celebrated\r\nsieges, yet it was only taken twice,--by the Crusaders in 1204 (held by\r\nthem till 1261), and by the Turks under Mohammed II., May 29, 1453,--an\r\nevent which completed the extinction of the Roman empire in the East.\r\n\r\n=Contest.= In a military sense, to struggle to defend; as, the troops\r\ncontested every inch of ground. Earnest struggle for superiority,\r\ndefense, or the like; strife in arms.\r\n\r\n=Continental.= A term adopted by the Americans in the Revolutionary war\r\nin contradistinction to British.\r\n\r\n=Contingent.= This term is applied to the quota of troops furnished to\r\nthe common army by each member of a confederation of states; the\r\nproportion of troops or money furnished by each party to an alliance.\r\n\r\n=Contingent.= In the British service, the sum paid monthly to each\r\ncaptain of a troop, company, or battery, to defray the expense of\r\nstationery, the care of arms, and other minor demands. A contingent\r\naccount is also the account, sent in by a staff-officer, of money\r\nexpended for miscellaneous purposes.\r\n\r\n=Contours.= Are the lines in which a site or ground surface is cut by\r\nhorizontal planes, usually taken at equidistances.\r\n\r\n=Contraband of War.= Are such articles as a belligerent has by the law\r\nof nations the right of preventing a neutral from furnishing to his\r\nenemy. Articles contraband of war are, in general, arms and munitions of\r\nwar and those out of which munitions of war are made. Contraband\r\narticles are subject to confiscation; but very arbitrary interpretations\r\nhave been affixed to the term by powerful states, when able to enforce\r\nthem by arms. Thus, provisions are held contraband of war when it is the\r\nobject to reduce the enemy by famine. But with respect to these and\r\nother articles not in their nature contraband, it seems to be the\r\npractice that the belligerent should purchase them from the neutral for\r\na reasonable equivalent, instead of confiscating.\r\n\r\n=Contramure.= In fortification, is a wall built before another\r\npartition-wall to strengthen it, so that it may receive no damage from\r\nthe adjacent buildings.\r\n\r\n=Contravallation.= In fortification, is an intrenchment formed in the\r\nsame manner as the line of circumvallation, to defend the besiegers\r\nagainst the enterprises of the garrison. An army forming a siege lies\r\nbetween the line of circumvallation and contravallation. The trench of\r\nthis line is towards the town, at the foot of the parapet, and is never\r\nmade but when the garrison is numerous enough to harass and interrupt\r\nthe besiegers by sallies. This line is constructed in the rear of the\r\ncamp, and by the same rule as the line of circumvallation, with this\r\ndifference, that, as it is only intended to resist a body of troops much\r\ninferior to a force which might attack the circumvallation, its parapet\r\nis not made so thick, nor the ditch so wide and deep.\r\n\r\n=Contre-forts= (_Fr._). Brick-work which is added to the revetment of a\r\nrampart on the side of the terre-plein, and which is equal to its\r\nheight. Contre forts are used to support the body of earth with which\r\nthe rampart is formed. They are likewise used in the revetments of\r\ncounterscarps, in gorges and demi-gorges, etc. Contre-forts likewise\r\nform a part of the construction of powder-magazines, which are\r\nbomb-proof.\r\n\r\n=Contreras.= A celebrated battle-field of Mexico, about 14 miles south\r\nof the capital.

Cut as many as is thought requisite. Divide them\r\ninto three classes,--_ground-poles_, _cross-poles_, and _stringers_. The\r\nground-poles should be the largest and heaviest. The cross-poles are\r\ncomparatively short lengths, and lie across the ground-poles with their\r\nends projecting some distance beyond. They are laid closely together,\r\nand then secured and bound down by the stringers which lie on them. A\r\ntree-nail driven in here and there serves to keep all in place by\r\nnipping the cross-poles tightly. The ends of the ground-poles and\r\nstringers may be either scarfed and tree-nailed, or laid side by side\r\nand tied with withers or strips of suitable bark. This road is quickly\r\nmade and found very useful in transporting the supplies of an army over\r\na wet, marshy country.\r\n\r\n=Core.= When cannon are cast hollow, after the plan of Rodman, a core is\r\nused to make the bore.

It was\r\nfirst occupied by the Phæcians, and then by the Liburnians; but the\r\naccounts of it are somewhat mythical until its settlement by the\r\nCorinthians about 734 B.C., and through its commerce it soon after\r\nacquired a considerable importance. It soon quarreled with the\r\nmother-country, and after many vicissitudes of fortune passed under the\r\ndominion of the Romans about 229 B.C. The town is defended by two\r\nfortresses, and garrisoned by British troops since 1864, though\r\nbelonging to the kingdom of Greece.\r\n\r\n=Corinth.= An ancient and celebrated city of Greece, the capital of a\r\ndepartment of the same name, situated on the Isthmus of Corinth.

It was evacuated by the Confederates under Beauregard,\r\nMay 29, 1862, and next day occupied by the Federal forces under Gen.\r\nHalleck. The Confederates, under Gens. Van Dorn, Price, and others,\r\nattempted to take this place, but they were thoroughly defeated after\r\nseveral desperate struggles by Gen. Rosecrans, October 3-5, 1862. The\r\nConfederate loss in prisoners alone was nearly 3000.\r\n\r\n=Corinthian War.= Began 395 B.C.; received this name because it was\r\ncarried on mostly in the neighborhood of Corinth; waged by a confederacy\r\nof the Athenians, Thebans, Corinthians, and Argives against the\r\nLacedæmonians.

A troop\r\nof horse was so called.\r\n\r\n=Cornette-blanche= (_Fr._). An ornament which in ancient times served to\r\ndistinguish French officers who were high in command. It was worn by\r\nthem on the top of their helmets. It likewise meant a royal standard,\r\nand was substituted in the room of the royal pennon.

The same rule governs\r\nin verbal applications: for example, a lieutenant seeking an indulgence\r\nmust apply through his captain, the captain through the adjutant, and so\r\non. All correspondence relating to or involving the _personnel_ of the\r\narmy when forwarded to the Secretary of War for his orders, must be\r\nforwarded through the adjutant-general for the consideration of the\r\ngeneral of the army.\r\n\r\n=Corridor.= The covered way lying round the whole compass of the\r\nfortifications of a place.\r\n\r\n=Corselet.= A little cuirass, or piece of armor to cover the front of\r\nthe body, worn formerly by pikemen.\r\n\r\n=Corsica.= An island in the Mediterranean, held by the French.

Staunton, against a native\r\nforce numbering at least 3000 infantry and about 20,000 cavalry, the\r\nstruggle terminating in the repulse of the assailants after terrible\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\n=Cossacks= (Russ., _Kasacks_). A military organization of irregulars in\r\nthe Russian service.

Under the present construction of law, members of\r\ncourts-martial become judges and jurors. In ancient feudal times the\r\nlords had arbitrary power over vassals who held their lands by tenure of\r\nmilitary service, and punished them as they saw fit, and courts of\r\nchivalry took cognizance of offenses committed by the nobles. With the\r\ndecline of feudalism the system of military despotism became obnoxious\r\nto the English people, and although the necessity for a standing army\r\nwas admitted in time of peace, it could only exist with the consent of\r\nParliament. The first military act passed after the accession of William\r\nto the throne of England is believed to have laid the foundation of the\r\npresent system of courts-martial, which has also been adopted to a\r\ncertain extent in the American service. Parliament having been notified\r\nthat a body of English and Scotch troops who were ordered to Holland had\r\nmutinied, that body passed, on April 3, 1689, an act for punishing\r\nmutiny, desertion, etc., which has been renewed annually by Parliament\r\nto the present day. It authorized the king to grant commissions to\r\ncertain officers to hold courts-martial for the trial of crimes\r\ncommitted by officers and soldiers. Similar acts were at different times\r\npassed in relation to offenses committed in the navy. A court-martial is\r\na court of limited and special jurisdiction called into existence by\r\nforce of express statute for a special purpose, and to perform a\r\nparticular duty; and when the object of its creation is accomplished it\r\nceases to exist. The law presumes nothing in its favor. He who seeks to\r\nenforce its sentences, or to justify its conduct under them, must set\r\nforth affirmatively and clearly all the facts which are necessary to\r\nshow that it was legally constituted, and that the subject was within\r\nits jurisdiction. And if in its proceedings or sentence it transcends\r\nthe limits of its jurisdiction, the members of the court and its officer\r\nwho executes its sentence are trespassers, and as such are answerable to\r\nthe party injured in damages in the courts of common law. Courts are\r\nclassed into general, garrison, summary, regimental, and\r\nfield-officers’, according as the authority convening, the nature of the\r\noffenses to be inquired into, the punishment to be awarded, or other\r\ncircumstances may determine. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 72 to 114;\r\nalso TRIAL.\r\n\r\n=Court of Honor.= Is a military court authorized by the regulations of\r\nthe Prussian service, convened for the purpose of sustaining the honor\r\nof the service and of individuals, and of punishing officers who may be\r\nfound guilty of conduct deviating even in the least from the principles\r\nwhich actuate military men as men of honor. The court of honor of a\r\nregiment consists of all commissioned officers in it, except the\r\nprosecutor, the defendant, near relations, officers appearing as\r\nwitnesses in the case, officers on leave, detached service, under\r\narrest, or awaiting trial before any court; and has for its regular\r\nbusiness management a council of honor, consisting of the senior\r\ncaptain, senior first lieutenant, and senior second lieutenant. The\r\ncourt has jurisdiction over all acts or omissions (not provided for by\r\nany fixed laws) which are unofficerlike or ungentlemanly in their\r\nnature, particularly such as contracting debts, improper choice of\r\nsociety, excessive use of intoxicating liquors, gambling, quarrels,\r\ncarelessness or neglect of duty, and scandal. With the exception of\r\ngeneral officers, all officers of the standing army, the reserve, the\r\nlandwehr, and those of the retired list are subject to the laws of the\r\ncourt of honor. The court to investigate the conduct of a field-officer\r\nis made up of the field-officers of the division to which the officer\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\n=Court of Inquiry.= In the military service of the United States, is a\r\nlegally constituted court which may be ordered by the President or by\r\nany commanding officer to examine into the nature of any transaction of,\r\nor accusation or imputation against, any officer or soldier upon a\r\ndemand by the officer or soldier whose conduct is to be inquired into.\r\nIt may consist of one, two, or three officers, and a judge-advocate or\r\nother suitable person as recorder, all of whom are sworn. It has the\r\nsame powers as a court-martial to summon witnesses and to examine them\r\non oath. Courts of inquiry cannot award punishment, but must report to\r\nthe officer by whose order they were assembled. (See APPENDIX, ARTICLES\r\nOF WAR, 115 to 121; also INQUIRY, BOARD OF.) In the British service\r\ncourts of inquiry are not regulated by any statute or standing\r\nregulation, but depend on the will of the sovereign, or of the superior\r\nofficer convoking the court, both as to the officers who may compose it,\r\nand as to every particular of its constitution. It is not a judicial\r\nbody, but is rather a council, having no power to compel the attendance\r\nof witnesses not of the army or navy, nor to administer oaths.\r\n\r\n=Courtrai.= A fortified town of Belgium, on the river Lys. Here Robert,\r\ncount of Artois, who had defeated the Flemings in 1297, was defeated and\r\nslain by them, July 11, 1302.

An ancient piece of ordnance, apparently a\r\nshort one.\r\n\r\n=Curtatone.= Near Mantua, Northern Italy. Here the Austrians under\r\nRadetzky crossed the Minco, and defeated the Italians after a severe\r\nconflict, May 29, 1848.\r\n\r\n=Customs of the Service.= Sometimes called common law of the army.\r\nSignifies generally a right or law not written, but established by long\r\nusage. To render a custom valid it has been said that the following\r\nqualities are requisite: 1, habitual or long established practice; 2,\r\ncontinuance without interruption; 3, without dispute; 4, it must be\r\nreasonable; 5, certain; 6, compulsory; 7, customs must be consistent\r\nwith each other. It may be said that the common law of the army derives\r\nits force from the tacit consent of those in the service. Gen. Kautz\r\nstates that officers of the army have certain duties to perform that are\r\ngoverned by certain laws, rules, and regulations, which are interpreted\r\nand executed in a certain way, called “Customs of the Service.” A\r\nknowledge of these rules of the service, and their application,\r\nconstitutes the military profession, and is the true art of war. To this\r\nextent it is an exact science, and may be acquired by application and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n=Custozza.= Near Verona, Northern Italy. Here the Italians were\r\ndefeated by Marshal Radetzky, July 23, 1848; and here they were again\r\ndefeated June 24, 1866, after a series of desperate attacks on the\r\nAustrian army. The Italians were commanded by their king, Victor\r\nEmmanuel, and the Austrians by the Archduke Albrecht.\r\n\r\n=Cut Off, To.= To intercept, to hinder from union or return. In a\r\nmilitary sense this phrase is variously applicable, and extremely\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nTO CUT OFF AN ENEMY’S RETREAT is to manœuvre in such a manner as to\r\nprevent an opposing army or body of men from retiring, when closely\r\npressed, either to their intrenchments or into a fortified town from\r\nwhich they had marched or sallied.\r\n\r\n=Cut up, To.= To destroy promiscuously. When the cavalry are sent in\r\npursuit of a flying enemy, the latter are generally cut up.\r\n\r\n=Cuttack= (anc. _Catac_). A province in the East Indies, ceded to the\r\nEast India Company in 1803.

It was divided among several petty kings\r\ntill the time of Cyrus of Persia, who subdued them. It was taken by the\r\nGreeks in 477 B.C., and ranked among the proconsular provinces in the\r\nreign of Augustus. It was conquered by the Saracens, 648 A.D., but\r\nrecovered by the Greeks in 957. It was reduced by Richard I. of England\r\nin 1191, and given by him to Guy de Lusignan, who became king in 1192,\r\nand whose descendants governed it until 1489, when it was sold to the\r\nVenetians. It was taken by the Turks in August, 1571, and held by them\r\nuntil June, 1878, when it was awarded to England by the “Peace Congress\r\nof Berlin.”\r\n\r\n=Czaslau.= A town of Bohemia, 45 miles east-southeast of Prague. Here\r\nFrederick the Great gained a victory over the Austrians, May 17, 1742.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dacia.= The land of the Daci or Getæ. It comprised the various\r\ncountries now known as Eastern Hungary, Transylvania, Wallachia, and\r\nMoldavia. The Getæ came originally from Thrace, and were divided into\r\nvarious tribes, and seem to have been the most valiant of the Thracian\r\nbarbarians. Curio, the first Roman general who ever penetrated as far\r\nnorth as the Danube, did not venture to assail them. Julius Cæsar,\r\nhowever, is said to have intended their subjugation. In 10 B.C.,\r\nAugustus sent an army up the valley of the Maros. From this time a\r\ncontinual war was waged by the Dacians against the Romans, who actually\r\ncompelled the latter, in the reign of Domitian, to pay a tribute. In 101\r\nA.D. the Emperor Trajan crossed the Theiss, and marched into\r\nTransylvania, where he fought a great battle near Thorda. The Daci, who\r\nwere commanded by their famous chief Decebalus, were defeated. A second\r\nexpedition of the emperor’s (104 A.D.) resulted in the destruction of\r\ntheir capital, the death of Decebalus, and the loss of their freedom. In\r\n270 and 275 A.D. the Romans abandoned the country to the Goths, and the\r\ncolonists were transferred to Mœsia. After a series of vicissitudes,\r\nDacia fell into the possession of the Magyars in the 9th century.\r\n\r\n=Dacota.= See DAKOTA.\r\n\r\n=Dadur.= A town of Beloochistan, 5 miles to the east of the Bolan Pass.\r\nIt is said to be one of the hottest places in the world, and is\r\ncelebrated as the place where, in November, 1840, the British troops\r\nrouted a Kelat force.\r\n\r\n=Dag.= A thick, clumsy pistol, used in the 15th and 16th centuries.\r\n\r\n=Dagen.= A peculiar kind of poniard.\r\n\r\n=Dagger.= A weapon resembling a sword, but considerably smaller, being\r\nused for stabbing at close quarters.

Dagger, a short thick poniard which was formerly used\r\nwhen individuals engaged in single combat.\r\n\r\n=Dahlgren Gun.= So named from Admiral Dahlgren, its inventor. An\r\nimproved form of ordnance used for howitzers, heavy artillery, and\r\nespecially in naval gunnery. It having been demonstrated that in\r\nordinary cast guns the weight of the metal forward is greater than is\r\nneeded, and that by far the greatest strain in firing is at the breech,\r\nDahlgren greatly increased the relative size and weight of the breech,\r\nwith the best results. These guns are chiefly used by the U. S. forces.\r\nSee ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Dahme.= A town of Prussia, on the river of the same name. It is\r\ndefended by a strong citadel, and inclosed by walls. Here, in 1713, the\r\nFrench were defeated by the Prussians.\r\n\r\n=Dahomey.= An independent state of Guinea, Western Africa, extending\r\nalong the coast from Fort Badagry on the east, to the river Volta, which\r\nseparates it from Ashantee on the west. The Dahomans, who came into\r\npossession of this tract of country about the beginning of the 18th\r\ncentury, are for the most part tall, well formed, and intelligent, and,\r\nfor an African race, singularly honest and far advanced in agriculture.\r\nWith the exception of a few Mohammedans, whose religious belief is in no\r\nway interfered with, they are all pagans, and practice fetish-worship.\r\nThe king is the most absolute of despots, having entire control over the\r\nlives and property of his subjects. Wholesale murder is one of the chief\r\nfeatures in religious and state ceremonies, and the most valued\r\nornaments of the royal residence are human skulls. As many as 2000 human\r\nvictims are sometimes sacrificed at one “grand custom.” Of the regular\r\narmy of 12,000, about one-half are Amazons (devoted to celibacy), who\r\nare described as much more effective soldiers than their male companions\r\nin arms; but at the same time as blood-thirsty and ferocious as\r\ntigresses.\r\n\r\n=Dahra.= In Algeria; on June 18, 1845, above 500 Kabyles at war with the\r\nFrench, were suffocated in a cave by smoke, the fire having been kindled\r\nby order of Gen.

The massacre was condemned by\r\nSoult, the minister of war, but justified by Marshal Bugeaud.\r\n\r\n=Dakota.= A Territory in the north central part of the United States. It\r\nwas organized under a territorial form of government March 2, 1861, but\r\nvery extensive alterations have since been made in its boundaries. The\r\nTerritory has been greatly disturbed by marauding bands of Sioux\r\nIndians, or Dakotas, who were in 1862 and 1863 especially daring and\r\naggressive, and though they have frequently been defeated by U. S.\r\ntroops, notably under Gens. Sully and Sibley in 1863, they are still\r\nvery troublesome, necessitating the frequent intervention of troops for\r\nthe protection of the settlers.\r\n\r\n=Dakota Indians.= A numerous and powerful tribe or collection of tribes\r\nof Indians of common stock, often called Sioux, who formerly roamed over\r\nthe territory between the Missouri and Mississippi, but have moved\r\nfarther west since 1851, and are settled on agencies in Dakota, Montana,\r\nNebraska, etc. A great proportion of them still preserve their nomadic\r\nhabits and are still frequently troublesome. See INDIANS AND THEIR\r\nAGENCIES.\r\n\r\n=Dalecarlians.= Natives of Dalecarlia, Sweden, who revolted against\r\nChristian of Denmark, 1521, and placed Gustavus Vasa on the throne of\r\nSweden.\r\n\r\n=Dalmatia.= A narrow strip of territory extending along the Adriatic\r\nSea; bounded north by Istria and Croatia, and east by Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. In ancient times Dalmatia was a considerable kingdom, and,\r\nafter many unsuccessful attempts, was first subjugated by the Romans in\r\nthe time of Augustus. After the fall of the Western empire, Dalmatia,\r\nwhich had formed the most southern part of the province of Illyricum,\r\nwas captured by the Goths, from whom it was taken by the Avari (490),\r\nwho in their turn yielded it to the Slavonians about 620. It continued\r\nunder the rule of the Slavonians until the beginning of the 11th\r\ncentury, when King Ladislaus of Hungary incorporated a part of it with\r\nCroatia, while the other part, with the title of duchy, placed itself\r\nunder the protection of the Venetian republic. The Turks afterwards made\r\nthemselves masters of a small portion, and by the peace of Campo-Formio\r\n(1797), the Venetian part, with Venice itself, became subject to\r\nAustrian rule, and when Austria, in 1805, had ceded this part to\r\nNapoleon, it was annexed to the kingdom of Italy; afterwards (1810) to\r\nIllyria. Since 1814, excepting the Turkish portion, it has been reunited\r\nwith Austria.\r\n\r\n=Damages, Barrack.= In the British service, is the term applied to the\r\ninjuries done to barracks, barrack furniture, etc., by soldiers, when\r\nthe actual perpetrator cannot be discovered.

Damages to arms, clothing, etc. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR,\r\n17.\r\n\r\n=Damascus.= A city of Syria, in Asiatic Turkey. During the time of the\r\nHebrew monarchy, it was the capital of Syria, but afterwards passed\r\nsuccessively under the rule of the Assyrians, Persians, Macedonians,\r\nRomans, and Saracens; and finally, in 1516, it was captured by the Turks\r\n(under Sultan Selim I.), in whose hands it has remained ever since.\r\nDamascus was at one time celebrated for the manufacture of sword-blades\r\nof the finest temper and most exquisite workmanship, but the process by\r\nwhich such unequaled specimens of art were perfected appears no longer\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\n=Damaskin.= A certain kind of sabre; so called from the manufacture of\r\nDamascus.\r\n\r\n=Dame= (_Fr._).

Natives of Denmark; during their attacks upon\r\nBritain and Ireland they made a descent on France, where, in 895, under\r\nRollo, they received presents under the walls of Paris. They returned\r\nand ravaged the French territories as far as Ostend in 896. They\r\nattacked Italy in 903. Neustria was granted by the king of France to\r\nRollo and his Normans (Northmen), hence Normandy, in 911. The Danes\r\ninvaded England, Scotland, and Ireland with varying successes from 783\r\nto 1084.\r\n\r\n=Dangerous Space.= That zone, partly before and partly beyond the object\r\nfired at (the sights having been correctly elevated), which is _covered_\r\nby the trajectory; the object may be displaced to the front or rear of\r\nits correct range-point, a distance equal, in the aggregate, to the\r\ndepth of this zone, and still be struck by the projectile. “Dangerous\r\nspace” is calculated under the assumption that the gun when fired is 56\r\ninches from the ground, that it is aimed at a point 34 inches from the\r\nground, and that the stature of a man is 68 inches; and that the head of\r\na man on horseback is 8 feet above the ground. The “dangerous space”\r\nwill, of course, be increased by the firer lying down and aiming at his\r\nadversary’s feet. A part of the “dangerous space” is near the muzzle of\r\nthe gun in the rising branch of the trajectory; the rest of it is in the\r\nfalling branch; these two parts being continuous up to and including the\r\n“battle-range” (which see). The “dangerous space” varies with the weapon\r\nused and the object fired at; and for the same arm diminishes as the\r\nrange increases beyond “battle-range”; up to this point it increases\r\nwith the range. A perfect understanding of this subject is essential to\r\neffective infantry fire upon the field of battle. Valuable tables will\r\nbe found upon it in Laidley’s “Rifle Firing.”\r\n\r\n=Dannebrog.= The ancient battle-standard of Denmark, bearing the figures\r\nof a cross and crown. It was fabled to have fallen from heaven at the\r\nbattle of Volmar, in Esthonia (1219), during a crusade against the\r\nheathens. It was twice taken in battle and twice recaptured. In 1500 a\r\nmere fragment remained.\r\n\r\n=Dannebrog, Order of the.= Is the second of the Danish orders of\r\nknighthood.

In the 10th century it was known as the\r\ncapital of Pomerali; it passed with that province, in 1295, under the\r\nauthority of Poland; but in 1308, Ladislaus IV. ceded the whole to the\r\nTeutonic knights, who held it till 1454. In that year it was again\r\nseized by the Poles; and in 1575, having refused to acknowledge Stephen\r\nBathory, it had to sustain a siege by that monarch, and was taken in\r\n1577. From 1360 to 1641 it was one of the principal towns in the\r\nHanseatic League. When this league was dissolved, Dantzic joined Lubeck,\r\nHamburg, and Bremen; and these four cities, down to a very late period,\r\nretained their name of Hanse Towns. In 1734 it was forced to surrender\r\nto the Russians and Saxons, who were then besieging Stanislaus of\r\nPoland. In 1793 it was occupied by the Prussians. It was taken by the\r\nFrench in May, 1807, after a long siege, by Marshal Lefevre, who thence\r\nacquired his title of duke of Dantzic. After Bonaparte’s disastrous\r\ncampaign in Russia, it was blockaded and obliged to surrender, after a\r\nlong and able defense by Gen. Rapp. At the peace of Paris, in 1814, it\r\nreverted to Prussia.\r\n\r\n=Dardanelles=, or =Hellespont= (anc. _Hellespontus_).

As it is the key to Constantinople, there are on both shores\r\nof this narrow channel numerous forts and batteries, there being 8 on\r\nthe European and 7 on the Asiatic side. It was here the invading armies\r\nof Xerxes crossed on a bridge of boats to enter Europe. The passage of\r\nthe strait was achieved by the British under Sir John Duckworth,\r\nFebruary 9, 1807; but he repassed with great loss, March 2, two castles\r\noccupying the sites of the ancient Sestos and Abydos, hurling down\r\nstones of many tons weight upon the British. The allied English and\r\nFrench passed the Dardanelles at the sultan’s request, October, 1853.\r\n\r\n=Dart.= A pointed, missile weapon, intended to be thrown by the hand; a\r\nshort lance; a javelin; hence, any missile weapon.\r\n\r\n=Dartmouth.= A seaport town of England, in Devonshire; it was burnt by\r\nthe French in the reigns of Richard I. and Henry IV.

In the war of the Parliament, Dartmouth was taken,\r\nafter a siege of four weeks, by Prince Maurice, who garrisoned the place\r\nfor the king (1643); but it was retaken by Gen. Fairfax by storm in\r\n1646.\r\n\r\n=Dauphin= (_Dolphin_), _Fr._ An ornamental handle on brass guns over the\r\ntrunnions, so called from its resemblance to that fish.\r\n\r\n=Dauphiné.= An old province of Southeast France, successively held by\r\nthe Allobroges, Burgundians, and Lombards; was, about 723-24, delivered\r\nfrom the invading Saracens by Charles Martel.

It consisted in selecting by lot one-tenth\r\nof the whole body of troops who misbehaved, and putting them to death.\r\nThere have been a few instances of this species of punishment in modern\r\ntimes. In 1642 the Archduke Leopold employed it against a regiment of\r\ncavalry; Marshal Créqui also had recourse to it against the mutinous\r\ngarrison of Trèves, and before the battle of Waterloo Blücher is said to\r\nhave punished in this manner a body of mutinous troops.\r\n\r\n=Decisions.= In courts-martial, the majority of votes decides all\r\nquestions as to the admission or rejection of evidence, and on other\r\npoints involving law or custom.

In 1701\r\nit was separated from Pennsylvania, though subject to the same governor\r\ndown to the period of the Revolution, to the success of which it\r\ncontributed its full share, and for the maintenance of the results of\r\nwhich it has ever been a zealous advocate.\r\n\r\n=Delaware Indians.= A tribe of aborigines, called by themselves\r\n_Lenni-Lenape_, who formerly lived on the Delaware River, but are now\r\nsettled in Indian Territory, on the Wichita Agency, with the Caddos. See\r\nINDIANS AND THEIR AGENCIES.\r\n\r\n=Delf.= A heraldic charge representing a square sod or turf, the term\r\nbeing probably derived from the word _delve_, to dig. A _delf tenné_ is\r\nthe appropriate abatement for him who revokes his challenge, or\r\notherwise goes from his word.\r\n\r\n=Delhi.= A celebrated city of Northern India, situated on an offset of\r\nthe river Jumna.

The\r\ncastle was gallantly held by Col. William Salisbury for the king during\r\nthe civil wars of the revolution, but finally surrendered to the\r\nParliamentary forces under Gen. Mytton.\r\n\r\n=Dendermonde.= A town of Belgium, in the province of East Flanders. It\r\nis fortified, and has a citadel dating from 1584, and possessing the\r\nmeans of laying the surrounding country under water in case of an\r\nattack. Louis XIV. besieged it in vain in 1667, but Marlborough, aided\r\nby a long drought, succeeded in taking it in 1706.\r\n\r\n=Denmark.= A kingdom of Northern Europe, which, with Sweden and Norway,\r\nwas originally called Scandinavia. In ancient times it was occupied by a\r\nfierce and warlike people, whose principal occupation was piracy. In 832\r\nthe Danes landed in England, and there established two kingdoms, and two\r\ncenturies afterwards the conquest of England was completed by Canute,\r\nking of Denmark. In the 15th century Christian I. connected Norway,\r\nSleswick, and Holstein with the crown of Denmark, but in consequence of\r\nsiding with Napoleon, Denmark was obliged to cede Norway to Sweden in\r\n1814. In 1848 Sleswick and Holstein revolted, the duchies being aided by\r\nPrussia and other powers of the Germanic Confederation, who, however,\r\nconcluded a peace on their own account, July 2, 1850. The duchies\r\ncontinued the war, were defeated at Idstet, July 25, 1850, and peace was\r\nrestored by the intervention of the powers in January, 1851. Hostilities\r\nagain commenced in 1863, and were terminated by the peace of Vienna in\r\n1864, Denmark renouncing all claim on Sleswick-Holstein.\r\n\r\n=Dennewitz.= A small village in the province of Brandenburg, Prussia.\r\nHere was fought, on the 6th of September, 1813, a battle between 70,000\r\nFrench, Saxons, and Poles, commanded by Marshal Ney, and 45,000\r\nPrussians, under Gen. Tauentzien. Both armies more than once drove each\r\nother from their positions, but the Prussians finally prevailed, and Ney\r\ngave orders to retreat. At this moment Bernadotte, crown-prince of\r\nSweden, appeared at the head of a large army, and turned the retreat of\r\nthe French army into a complete rout.\r\n\r\n=Denonciateur= (_Fr._). In a general sense, may not improperly be called\r\na military informer. So rigid indeed were the regulations (even in the\r\nmost corrupt state of the French government) against every species of\r\nmisapplication and embezzlement, that if a private dragoon gave\r\ninformation to the commissary of musters of a troop horse that had\r\npassed muster, having been used in the private service of an officer, he\r\nwas not only entitled to his discharge, but received, moreover, 100\r\nlivres in cash, and became master of the horse and equipage, with which\r\nhe retired unmolested. The officer was summarily dealt with.\r\n\r\n=Densimeter.= An apparatus for obtaining the specific gravity of\r\ngunpowder by immersing it in mercury. It consists of an open vessel\r\ncontaining mercury, a frame supporting a glass globe communicating by a\r\ntube with the mercury in the open vessel, and joined at top to a\r\ngraduated glass tube, which communicates by a flexible tube with an\r\nordinary air-pump. Stop-cocks are inserted in the tubes above and below\r\nthe glass globe, and a diaphragm of chamois-skin is placed over the\r\nbottom orifice and one of wire cloth over the top orifice of the globe.\r\nThe arrangement allows the globe to be filled with mercury to any mark\r\non the graduated tube, or with gunpowder and mercury. The globe can be\r\ntaken off and weighed in both cases. The specific gravity is obtained\r\nfrom the relation between the weights in the two cases.\r\n\r\n=Density.= The density or specific gravity of gunpowder is one of its\r\nmost important properties. In the form of dust, the velocity of\r\ncombustion increases rapidly with the density up to about 1.60, when it\r\ndecreases. In grained powder the velocity of combustion decreases as the\r\ndensity increases. For English or American powder this velocity is about\r\nfour-tenths of an inch per second. For French and most of the\r\ncontinental powders, which are less dense than the English, it is about\r\nforty-eight-hundredths of an inch. The excellent preservative qualities\r\nof English and American powders are largely due to their high\r\ndensities,--the standard being about 1.75. A certain degree of density\r\nis absolutely essential to grain powder to prevent the inflamed gases\r\nfrom penetrating the pores of the powder and flashing off the whole mass\r\nto the destruction of the gun. In the manufacture of powder the density\r\ndepends, first, upon the amount of trituration to which the ingredients\r\nare subjected in the incorporating mill; second, upon the pressure\r\nemployed to form the cake; and, third, upon the degree of moisture it\r\ncontains when subjected to these operations, particularly the last. The\r\npressure-gauge is not a reliable measure of the _density_ given to a\r\npowder, though a good indication of the _hardness_, with which density\r\nmust not be confounded. Dry powder meal offers a great resistance to\r\ncompression, but becomes very hard,--the work being consumed in\r\nconsolidating the surface particles. To obtain uniform density a certain\r\namount of moisture is necessary to assist the particles in their\r\nmovement. As much as 6 per cent. of moisture is used in making prismatic\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n=Department Commander.= See GEOGRAPHICAL DEPARTMENT, COMMANDER OF.\r\n\r\n=Department, Military.= A military subdivision of a country. The whole\r\nterritory of the United States is divided into military departments,\r\neach under a general officer.

No interest is payable, however, upon any deposit of less\r\nthan $50, or upon any sum, whatever its amount, which has been on\r\ndeposit for a less period than six months prior to date of discharge.\r\nDeposits are forfeited by desertion.\r\n\r\n=Depot.= Any place at which military stores are deposited for the use of\r\nan army. It also signifies a fort or other suitable place appropriated\r\nfor the reception of recruits, or detached parties belonging to\r\ndifferent regiments. In fortification, the term is likewise used to\r\ndenote a particular place at the trail of the trenches out of the reach\r\nof the cannon of a besieged place. It is here that besiegers generally\r\nassemble when ordered to attack the outworks, or support the troops in\r\nthe trenches when there is reason to imagine the besieged intend making\r\na sally.\r\n\r\n=Depredate.= To take plunder or prey; to commit waste; as, the troops\r\ndepredated on the country; also, in an active sense, to plunder or\r\npillage; to spoil; to lay waste.\r\n\r\n=Depressed Gun.= Any piece of ordnance having its mouth depressed below\r\nthe horizontal line.\r\n\r\n=Depression.= The pointing of any piece of ordnance so that its shot may\r\nbe projected short of the point-blank.\r\n\r\n=Depth.= A technical word, peculiarly applicable to bodies of men drawn\r\nup in line or column.

Garibaldi,\r\nin command of the Italian volunteers, defeated an Austrian force near\r\nthis place in 1859.\r\n\r\n=Desert.= To quit a service without permission; to run away; as, to\r\ndesert from the army; to forsake in violation of duty; as, to desert\r\none’s colors.\r\n\r\n=Deserter.= A soldier who absconds, during the period for which he is\r\nenlisted, from the service of the army or navy. In England this crime\r\nwas by certain old statutes made punishable with death, but now the\r\npunishment is left to the discretion of a court-martial. In the United\r\nStates, deserters in the time of war may be sentenced to death, but in\r\ntime of peace the penalty for this offense is lighter.\r\n\r\n=Desertion.= The act of absence from duty without intention to return.\r\nSee APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 47.\r\n\r\n=Despatch=, or =Dispatch=. An official military letter sent by the\r\ncommander of an army in the field to the authorities at home.

See DISPATCHES.\r\n\r\n=Detach.= To separate for a special object or use; as, to send out a\r\nbody of men on some particular service, separate from that of the main\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n=Detached Bastion.= In fortification, is that basis which is separated\r\nfrom the enceinte by a ditch.\r\n\r\n=Detached Works.= In fortification, are such outworks as are detached,\r\nor at a distance from the body of the place; such as half-moons,\r\nravelins, bastions, etc.\r\n\r\n=Detachment.= In military affairs, an uncertain number of men drawn out\r\nfrom several regiments or camps equally, to march or be employed as the\r\ngeneral may think proper, whether on an attack, at a siege, or in\r\nparties to scour the country. A detachment of 2000 or 3000 men is a\r\ncommand for a general officer, 800 for a colonel, 500 for\r\nlieutenant-colonel, 200 or 300 for a major, 80 or 100 for a captain, 40\r\nfor a lieutenant, 12 for a sergeant, and 6 for a corporal.\r\n\r\n=Detachment, Gun.= The men required for the service of a piece of\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\n=Detachment, Manœuvring.= The men required for mechanical manœuvres of a\r\nsiege or sea-coast gun.\r\n\r\n=Detail for Duty.= Is a roster, or table, for the regular performance of\r\nduty either in camp or garrison.

Ordinary explosion proceeds by inflammation,\r\nbeing nothing more than a rapid combustion. Detonation is propagated by\r\nvibration. A detonating agent is a substance used to produce the\r\n_initial vibration_, or “impulse of explosion.” The exploder, or cap,\r\nused for this purpose is usually primed with fulminate of mercury, a\r\nsubstance having a wide range in bringing about detonation in the high\r\nexplosives.\r\n\r\n=Dettingen.= A village of Bavaria, on the Maine.

Some old pieces of artillery were\r\nanciently so called. The Dragon was a 40-pounder; the Dragon Volant a\r\n32-pounder. But neither the name nor the size of the caliber of either\r\npiece is now in use.\r\n\r\n=Dragonner= (_Fr._). According to the French acceptation of the term, is\r\nto attack any person in a rude and violent manner; to take anything by\r\nforce; to adopt prompt and vigorous means; and to bring those people to\r\nreason by hard blows, who could not be persuaded by fair words.\r\n\r\n=Dragoon.= From the old fable that the dragon spouts fire, the head of\r\nthe monster was worked upon the muzzle of a peculiar kind of short\r\nmuskets which were first carried by the horsemen raised by Marshal\r\nBrissac in 1600. This circumstance led to their being called dragoons;\r\nand from the general adoption of the same weapon, though without the\r\nemblem in question, the term gradually extended itself till it became\r\nalmost synonymous with horse-soldier. Dragoons were at one time a kind\r\nof mounted infantry, drilled to perform the services both of horse and\r\nfoot. At present, dragoon is simply one among many designations for\r\ncavalry, not very precise in its application. This term is not now used\r\nin the U. S. service.\r\n\r\n=Dragoon, To.= Is to persecute by abandoning a place to the rage of the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n=Dragoon Guards.= In the British service, seven regiments of heavy\r\ncavalry bear this title.\r\n\r\n=Drag-rope.= This is a 4-inch hemp rope, 28 feet long, with a thimble\r\nworked into each end, one of the thimbles carrying a hook.

To _draw out_ is to call the\r\nsoldiers forth in array for action. To _draw up_ is to form in battle\r\narray. To _draw out a party_ is to assemble any particular number of\r\narmed men for military duty. The French say, _faire un detachement_.\r\n\r\n=Drayton-in-Hales=, or =Market Drayton=. A town of England, in\r\nShropshire. Here the partisans of the house of York defeated the\r\nLancastrians in 1459.\r\n\r\n=Dresden.= The capital of the kingdom of Saxony, and one of the best\r\nbuilt towns of Europe. Taken by Frederick of Prussia in 1756; by the\r\nAustrians in 1759; bombarded in vain by Frederick, July, 1760. On August\r\n26-27, 1813, the allies were defeated in a terrible battle by the French\r\nunder the walls of this city; and about a mile from it is a granite\r\nblock, surmounted by a helmet, marking the spot where Moreau fell in the\r\nconflict, while conversing with the emperor Alexander.\r\n\r\n=Dress.= A word of command for alignment of troops; also of the\r\nalignment itself.\r\n\r\n=Dressers.= See GUIDES.\r\n\r\n=Dress, Full.= Dress uniform.

From the 14th to the 17th\r\ncentury, Drogheda was the chief military station in Ulster. In 1641 the\r\ntown was besieged by O’Neal and the northern Irish forces, but was\r\ngallantly defended by Sir Henry Tichbourne, and after a long blockade\r\nrelieved by the Marquis of Ormond, who also relieved it a second time\r\nwhen invested by the Parliamentary army under Col. Jones. In 1649,\r\nCromwell was twice repulsed in besieging this town; but in the third\r\nattempt he was successful, when most of the garrison were slaughtered.\r\nThis place surrendered to William III. the day after the battle of the\r\nBoyne, which was fought in 1690 at Oldbridge, 4 miles west of Drogheda.\r\n\r\n=Drum.= A musical instrument of percussion, formed by stretching a piece\r\nof parchment over each end of a cylinder formed of thin wood, or over\r\nthe top of a caldron-shaped vessel of brass; the latter is hence called\r\na kettle-drum. The large drums which are beaten at each end are called\r\n_double drums_, or _bass drums_, and are used chiefly in military bands.\r\nKettle-drums are always used in pairs; one of which is tuned to the\r\nkey-note, the other to the fifth of the key. The drum is principally\r\nused for military purposes, especially for inspiring the soldiers under\r\nthe fatigue of march or in battle. It is supposed to be an Eastern\r\ninvention, and to have been brought into Europe by the Arabians, or\r\nperhaps the Moors. In the French army the drum is now, to some extent,\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\n=Drum.= To execute on a drum, as a tune;--with _out_, to expel with beat\r\nof drum; as, to drum out a deserter, etc.; with _up_, to assemble by\r\nbeat of drum; to gather; to collect; as, to drum up recruits, etc.\r\n\r\n=Drumclog.= In Western Scotland; here the Covenanters defeated Graham of\r\nClaverhouse, June 1, 1679.

He also directs the\r\nmovements of the regimental band, while on parade.\r\n\r\n=Drummer.= The soldier who plays a drum. The majority of drummers are\r\nboys, generally the sons of soldiers. In former times it was the part of\r\na drummer’s duty to flog men sentenced to corporal punishment.\r\n\r\n=Drumming Out.= The ceremony of ignominiously discharging a soldier from\r\nthe service. The culprit is marched out of the garrison at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, the drummers or musicians playing the “Rogue’s March.”\r\n\r\n=Drum-stick.= A stick with which a drum is beaten, or shaped for the\r\npurpose of beating a drum.\r\n\r\n=Drunk on Duty.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 38.\r\n\r\n=Druses.= A warlike people dwelling among the mountains of Lebanon,\r\nderive their origin from a fanatical Mohammedan sect which arose in\r\nEgypt about 996, and fled to Palestine to avoid persecution. They now\r\nretain hardly any of the religion of their ancestors. In 1860, in\r\nconsequence of disputes, the Druses attacked their neighbors, the\r\nMaronites, whom they massacred, it was said, without regard to age or\r\nsex. This led to a general massacre of Christians soon after. But the\r\nTurkish troops, with French auxiliaries, interfering on behalf of the\r\nChristians, invaded Lebanon in August and September, when the Druses\r\nsurrendered, giving up their chiefs, January, 1861.\r\n\r\n=Dry Camp, To Make a.= Troops on the march are said _to make a dry camp_\r\nwhen they are compelled by exhaustion, or other causes, to camp at a\r\nplace where there is no water. For such camps water is usually\r\ntransported with the troops.\r\n\r\n=Dualin.= See EXPLOSIVES.\r\n\r\n=Dubicza=, or =Dubitza=. A town and fort of European Turkey, in Bosnia,\r\non the Unna. The Austrians took this town in 1738.\r\n\r\n=Dublin.= The capital city of Ireland, on the Liffey, close to its\r\nentrance into Dublin Bay. It is alleged that this city has been in\r\nexistence since the time of Ptolemy. In the earlier part of the 9th\r\ncentury, Dublin was taken by the Danes, who infested it for several\r\ncenturies thereafter. In 1169 it was taken by storm by the English under\r\nStrongbow. From about this period the history of Dublin is that of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n=Ducenarius.= An officer in the Roman armies who commanded two\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n=Dudgeon.= A small dagger (rare).\r\n\r\n=Duel.= Was the old form of a combat between two persons, at a time and\r\nplace indicated in the challenge, cartel, or defiance borne by one party\r\nto the other. A duel generally takes place in the presence of witnesses,\r\ncalled seconds, who regulate the mode of fighting, place the weapons in\r\nthe hands of the combatants, and enforce compliance with the rules\r\nwhich they have laid down. In the United States the practice of fighting\r\nduels, being declared illegal by statutes, is very seldom resorted to.\r\n\r\n=Dueling.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 26, 27.\r\n\r\n=Duffadar.= A rank in the East Indian Native Cavalry, corresponding with\r\nthat of sergeant.\r\n\r\n=Duffadar, Kot.= A non-commissioned officer in the East Indian Native\r\nCavalry, corresponding with a troop sergeant-major.\r\n\r\n=Duffadar Major.= A rank in the East Indian Native Cavalry,\r\ncorresponding with that of regimental sergeant-major.\r\n\r\n=Duke.= From the Latin _dux_, a “leader,” a title that first came into\r\nuse when Constantine separated the civil and military commands in the\r\nprovinces. This title was successively borrowed by the Goths and Franks,\r\nand since the time of the Black Prince, who was created first duke in\r\nEngland (Duke of Cornwall) in 1335, it has been a title of the nobility,\r\nranking next below the blood royal.\r\n\r\n=Dukigi-Bachi.= Second officer in the Turkish artillery, who commands\r\nthe Topelas, or gunners and founders.\r\n\r\n=Duledge.= A peg of wood which joins the ends of the felloes, forming\r\nthe circle of the wheel of a gun-carriage; and the joint is strengthened\r\non the outside of the wheel by a strong plate of iron, called the\r\n_duledge plate_.\r\n\r\n=Dumdum.= The name of a town and of a valley in India, well known in the\r\nmilitary history of the country; it is 8 miles to the northeast of\r\nCalcutta, having extensive accommodations for troops, and a\r\ncannon-foundry.

In this town\r\nJohn Comyn, the competitor for the Scottish throne, was stabbed by\r\nRobert Bruce in 1305.\r\n\r\n=Dünaburg.= A strongly fortified town of Western Russia, on the Düna. It\r\nis of great military importance, owing to the strength of its\r\nfortifications. It was founded by the Knights of the Sword in 1277.\r\n\r\n=Dunbar.= A seaport town of Scotland, in Haddingtonshire, at the mouth\r\nof the Frith of Forth. On the high rocks at the entrance to the new\r\nharbor are a few fragments of the ruins of an old castle, which was once\r\nvery strong, and an important security against English invasions. Edward\r\nI. took it, and Edward II. fled thither after the battle of Bannockburn;\r\nit was demolished in 1333, and rebuilt in 1336; it was successfully\r\ndefended in a siege of six weeks against the Earl of Salisbury by Black\r\nAgnes, countess of Dunbar, in 1338; it sheltered Queen Mary and\r\nBothwell in 1567; and in the same year it was destroyed by the regent\r\nMurray. In 1650, Cromwell, at the “Race of Dunbar,” defeated the\r\nScottish army under Leslie.\r\n\r\n=Dunblane=, or =Dumblane=. A town and parish of Scotland, in Perthshire,\r\non the Allan.

Here the English army, commanded by Col. Jones,\r\nsignally defeated the Irish, of whom 6000 are said to have been slain,\r\nAugust 8, 1647.\r\n\r\n=Dungeon= (originally _Donjon_, which see). A prison; a dark and\r\nsubterraneous cell or place of confinement.\r\n\r\n=Dunkirk.= A fortified seaport town in the extreme northern part of\r\nFrance, in the department of the North. In 1558 the English, who had for\r\nsome time held possession of the town, were expelled from it by the\r\nFrench, who, in the ensuing year, surrendered it to the Spaniards. In\r\nthe middle of the 17th century it once more passed into the hands of the\r\nFrench, who, after a few years’ occupation of it, again restored it to\r\nSpain. In 1658 it was retaken by the French and made over to the\r\nEnglish. It was sold to the French king by Charles II. in 1662. In 1793\r\nit was attacked by the English under the Duke of York, who, however, was\r\ncompelled to retire from before its walls with severe loss.\r\n\r\n=Dunnottar.= A parish of Scotland, in Kincardineshire. It contains the\r\ncastle of Dunnottar, now in ruins. In the time of the civil wars, this\r\nwas the fortress in which the Scottish regalia were deposited. After\r\nbeing besieged by Cromwell’s forces for six months, it capitulated; but,\r\nbefore this, the regalia were secretly conveyed from it.\r\n\r\n=Dunsinane.= In Perthshire, Scotland. On the hill was fought the battle\r\nbetween Macbeth, the thane of Glammis, and Siward, earl of\r\nNorthumberland, July 27, 1054.

It is\r\nfortified, and is a place of considerable antiquity. Durazzo was founded\r\nabout 627 B.C. by a conjoined band of Corcyræans and Corinthians under\r\none Phaleus, a Heracleidan. It became a great and populous city, but was\r\nmuch harassed by the internal strifes of party, which ultimately led to\r\nthe Peloponnesian war. Under the Romans it was called _Dyrrachium_\r\n(whence its modern name). Here Pompey was for some time beleaguered by\r\nCæsar. In the 5th century it was besieged by Theodoric, the Ostro-Goth;\r\nin the 10th and 11th centuries by the Bulgarians; and in 1081 it was\r\ncaptured, after a severe battle, by the Norman, Robert Guiseard of\r\nApulia.\r\n\r\n=Düren.= A town of Prussia, on the Roer. This was a Roman town, and is\r\nmentioned by Tacitus by the name of _Marcodurum_. Charlemagne held two\r\ndiets here in 775 and 779, when on his way to attack the Saxons. It was\r\ntaken by assault and burned by Charles V., after an obstinate\r\nresistance, in 1543. In 1794 it fell into the hands of the French, but\r\nwas ceded to Prussia in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Dürkeim.= A town of Rhenish Bavaria, 20 miles north from Landau. The\r\nsummit of a height near this town is crowned by a rampart of loose\r\nstones 6 to 10 feet high, 60 to 70 feet wide at the base, and inclosing\r\na space of about two square miles called the _Heidenmauer_ (“heathens’\r\nwall”), which the Romans are said to have built to keep the barbarians\r\nin check, and where Attila is said to have passed a winter, after having\r\nwrested the fortress from the Romans, when passing on his way to Rome.\r\n\r\n=Durrenstein.= A town of Austria, on the Danube. In the neighborhood, on\r\na rock, are the ruins of the castle in which Richard Cœur de Lion was\r\nimprisoned in 1192. In 1805 the Russian and Austrian armies were\r\ndefeated here by the French.\r\n\r\n=Duties.= This word is used in military parlance to express the men\r\nparaded for any particular duty, such as guards, etc.\r\n\r\n=Duty.= There is no word oftener used in military parlance than this. In\r\nthe technical sense it refers to the various services necessary for the\r\nmaintenance, discipline, and regulation of armies,--as _signal duty_,\r\n_staff duty_, _the duties of a sentinel_, etc. To be _on duty_ is to be\r\nin the active exercise of military functions; to be _off duty_ is to\r\nhave these functions temporarily suspended; to be _put on duty_ is to be\r\nassigned to duty by order of a superior. Military duties are variously\r\nclassed as _duties of detail_, which are recurring and governed by a\r\nroster, such as guard, fatigue, etc.; _special duties_ which are\r\ndetermined by appointment, selection, or order; _extra duty_, continuous\r\nspecial duty of enlisted men, entitling them to pay; _daily duty_, short\r\nterms of special service for enlisted men. In a higher and broader sense\r\n_duty_ is that which is due one’s country. It covers all the soldier’s\r\nobligations, and forms his simplest and sublimest rule of action.\r\n\r\n=Dyer Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Dynamite=, called in the United States “giant powder,” is formed by\r\nmixing nitro-glycerine with certain porous substances, and especially\r\nwith certain varieties of silica or alumina, these substances absorbing\r\nthe nitro-glycerine. It was invented in 1867 by the Swedish engineer\r\nNobel, who proposed to prevent the frequent and unexpected explosions of\r\nnitro-glycerine, at the same time without sacrificing any of its power.\r\nThis he effected by the use of certain silicious earths as a base for\r\nthe absorption of the nitro-glycerine, the experiment resulting in the\r\nnew compound which he called dynamite, its transportation and handling\r\nbeing no more dangerous than that of ordinary gunpowder. It is not\r\nliable to spontaneous explosion like pure nitro-glycerine, nor can it\r\nbe exploded by moderate concussion; when unconfined, if set fire to, it\r\nwill burn without explosion; it may be safely kept at any moderate\r\ntemperature; is inexplosive when frozen, and acts effectively under\r\nwater. Its effects are proportional to the quantity of nitro-glycerine\r\nheld in absorption; but under circumstances where a sustained bursting\r\npressure is required, not being as instantaneous in its action as\r\nnitro-glycerine, its effects are more powerful than those of an equal\r\nweight of the pure material. The best absorbent of nitro-glycerine for\r\nthe formation of dynamite is a silicious earth found at Oberlohe,\r\nHanover. During the siege of Paris, a scientific committee of\r\ninvestigation, engaged in experimenting on different substances as a\r\nsubstitute for this earth, selected as the best silica, alumina, and\r\nboghead cinders. Any of these, they declared, when combined with\r\nnitro-glycerine, formed a substance which possessed all the remarkable\r\nqualities attributed to the dynamite of Nobel. During the siege of Paris\r\ndynamite was used successfully by the French engineers to free a\r\nflotilla of gunboats caught in the ice on the Seine, below Charenton, by\r\nsimply placing a quantity of it on the surface of the ice. The explosion\r\ndislodged the ice for a great distance, and the masses thus loosened,\r\nbeing directed into the current by the aid of a small steamer, floated\r\ndown the stream, and left the river open. There are various other\r\ncompounds of nitro-glycerine, such as dualin, glyoxiline, etc., all\r\ndiffering in the matter used as a base, they being generally some\r\nexplosive substances; but none of them appears to have come into such\r\ngeneral use or to be as reliable as dynamite. Many preparations of\r\nchlorate and picrate of potassium have also been used from time to time\r\nas explosive agents; but their great sensibility to friction or\r\npercussion renders them extremely dangerous; they are, therefore, not\r\nliable to come into general use. A preparation of potassium chlorate and\r\nsulphur, not liable to explode by concussion, but very sensitive to\r\nfriction, is used with great effect as a charge for explosive bullets.\r\n\r\n=Dynamometer.= An instrument for measuring the force of recoil in a\r\nsmall-arm, consisting usually of a spiral spring so arranged as to be\r\ncompressed by the butt of the gun in firing. An index shows the number\r\nof pounds required to produce a similar compression. The instruments now\r\nused by the U. S. Ordnance Department are graduated to show the effect\r\nof the recoil in _foot-pounds_ or _units of work_. This sensible change\r\nwas made at the suggestion of Lieut. Henry Metcalfe of that department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eagle.= In heraldry, is used as an emblem of magnanimity and fortitude.\r\nIn the Roman armies the eagle was used as a military standard, and even\r\nprevious to that time the Persians under Cyrus the Younger used the same\r\nmilitary emblem. In modern times, France, Russia, Prussia, Austria, and\r\nthe United States have adopted the eagle as a national military symbol.\r\nThe Austrian eagle is represented as double-headed.\r\n\r\n=Eagle, Black.= A Prussian order of knighthood, founded in 1701; united\r\nwith the order of the Red Eagle, or order of Sincerity, instituted by\r\nthe margraves of Bayreuth.\r\n\r\n=Earl Marshal.= Of England, is one of the officers of state; is the head\r\nof the college of arms, which has jurisdiction in descents and\r\npedigrees; determines all rival claims to arms; and he grants\r\narmorial-bearings, through the medium of the kings-of-arms, to parties\r\nnot possessed of hereditary arms.\r\n\r\n=Early Cannon.= See ORDNANCE, HISTORY OF.\r\n\r\n=Earth-bag.= See BAGS.\r\n\r\n=Earth-house=, or =Eird-house=. The name generally given throughout\r\nIreland and Scotland to the underground buildings (which in some places\r\nare called also “Picts’ houses”) which served to hide a few\r\npeople and their goods in time of war. The earth-house is a single\r\nirregularly-shaped chamber, from 4 to 10 feet in width, from 20 to 60\r\nfeet in length, and from 4 to 7 feet in height, built of unhewn and\r\nuncemented stones roofed by unhewn flags, and entered from near the top\r\nby a rude doorway, so low and narrow that only one man can slide down\r\nthrough it at a time. Implements of various kinds have been found in\r\nthem,--such as bronze swords, gold rings, etc.\r\n\r\n=Earthworks.= In fortification, is a general name for all military\r\nconstructions, whether for attack or defense, in which the material\r\nemployed is chiefly earth.\r\n\r\n=East Indian Army.= In 1861 the British Secretary of State for India\r\nbrought forward a measure for reorganizing the Indian army, which has\r\nbeen passed into a law. The British portion of the Indian army is to\r\nform part of the queen’s army generally, with certain honorary\r\ndistinctions, and is to take its turn at home and in the colonies like\r\nthe rest; but the expenses are to be paid out of Indian, not Imperial\r\nrevenues. The native portion is to be wholly in India; in its\r\nreconstruction many improvements are made to lessen the chances of\r\nfuture revolt.\r\n\r\n=Ebersberg=, or =Ebelsberg=. A town of Upper Austria, on the Traun, 8\r\nmiles northwest from Ens, remarkable for being the scene of the defeat\r\nof the Austrians by the French in 1809.\r\n\r\n=Eboulement= (_Fr._). The crumbling or falling of the walls of a\r\nfortification.\r\n\r\n=Ebro.= A river in Spain, the scene of a signal defeat of the Spaniards\r\nby the French under Lannes, near Tudela, November 23, 1808; and also of\r\nseveral important movements of the allied British and Spanish armies\r\nduring the Peninsular war (1809-13).\r\n\r\n=Eccentric.= A device applied to the truck wheels of top carriages and\r\nbeds of mortars in sea-coast artillery to give either rolling or sliding\r\nfriction at will. The wheels turn on axle-arms which project\r\neccentrically from the ends of an axle passing through both cheeks; when\r\nthe axle is turned the axle-arms carry the wheels up or down; when at\r\nthe lowest point the weight of the carriage is borne by the wheels, and\r\nthe system moves on rolling friction; the wheels are then said to be _in\r\ngear_; when _out of gear_, or at their highest points, the wheels do not\r\ntouch the rails or platform plates, but the cheeks rest on them, and the\r\ncarriage moves upon sliding friction. A similar device is attached to\r\nthe chassis near the pintle to enable it to be readily traversed when\r\n_in gear_, and give it stability when _out of gear_.\r\n\r\n=Eccentric Projectiles.= A spherical projectile in which the centre of\r\ninertia does not coincide with the centre of figure. Such projectiles\r\nare subject to great deviations, which can be predicted as to direction\r\nby knowing the position of the centre of inertia of the shot in the bore\r\nof the gun. (See PROJECTILES, DEVIATION OF.) The side of the ball upon\r\nwhich the centre of inertia lies can be found by floating it in a bath\r\nof mercury, and marking the highest point where it comes to a state of\r\nrest; the centre of inertia lies nearest the opposite side; its exact\r\nposition is determined by a kind of balance called the _eccentrometer_;\r\nthe ball is placed in the balance with the marked point nearest the\r\nfulcrum; the distance of the centre of inertia or gravity from the\r\nfulcrum is obtained by dividing the product of the counterbalancing\r\nweight and its distance from the fulcrum by the weight of the\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\n=Echarge, Feu=, or =Feu d’Echarge=. Is employed to signify that a column\r\nof troops is struck at a very oblique angle.\r\n\r\n=Echaugette.= In military history, signifies a watch-tower, or kind of\r\nsentry-box.\r\n\r\n=Echelon.= A military term applied to a certain arrangement of troops\r\nwhen several divisions are drawn up in parallel lines, each to the right\r\nor the left of the one preceding it, like “steps,” or the rounds of a\r\nladder, so that no two are on the same alignment. Each division by\r\nmarching directly forward can form a line with that which is in advance\r\nof it. There are two sorts of echelon, _direct_ and _oblique_, the\r\nformer of which is used in an attack or retreat.\r\n\r\n=Eckmühl=, or =Eggmühl=. A small village of Bavaria, on the Great Laber.\r\nThis place is celebrated for the important victory gained by the French\r\nover the Austrians on April 22, 1809, and which obtained for Davoust the\r\ntitle of Prince of Eckmühl.\r\n\r\n=Eclaireurs= (_Fr._). A corps of grenadiers raised by Bonaparte in\r\nFrance, who from their celerity of movements were compared to lightning.\r\n\r\n=Eclopes= (_Fr._). A military term to express those soldiers who, though\r\ninvalids, are well enough to follow the army. Among these may be classed\r\ndragoons or horsemen whose horses become lame and cannot keep up with\r\nthe troop or squadron. They always march in the rear of a column.\r\n\r\n=Ecole Polytechnique.= A celebrated military school in Paris,\r\nestablished in 1794, chiefly for the artillery service. The examinations\r\nfor the schools are public to all France. It not only furnishes officers\r\nof artillery, but also civil and military engineers of every\r\ndescription. The pupils of this school defended Paris in 1814 and 1830.\r\n\r\n=Economy.= In a military sense, implies the minutiæ or interior\r\nregulations of a regiment, troop, or company. Hence regimental economy.\r\n\r\n=Ecorcheurs= (_Flayers_). A name given to bands of armed adventurers who\r\ndesolated France and Belgium during the 15th century, beginning about\r\n1435, and they at one time numbered 100,000. They are said to have\r\nstripped their victims to their shirts, and flayed the cattle. They were\r\nfavored by the English invasion and the civil wars.\r\n\r\n=Ecoutes.= Small galleries made at equal distances in front of the\r\nglacis of the fortifications of a place. They serve to annoy the enemy’s\r\nminers, and to interrupt them in their work.\r\n\r\n=Ecreter= (_Fr._). To batter or fire at the top of a wall, redoubt,\r\nepaulement, etc., so as to dislodge or drive away the men that may be\r\nstationed behind it, in order to render the approach more easy. _Ecreter\r\nles pointes des palissades_ is to blunt the sharp ends of the palisades.\r\nThis ought always to be done before you attack the covert way, which is\r\ngenerally fenced by them.\r\n\r\n=Ecu= (_Fr._). A large shield which was used by the ancients, and\r\ncarried on their left arm, to ward off the blows of sword or sabre. This\r\ninstrument of defense was originally invented by the Samnites. The Moors\r\nhad _ecus_, or shields, sufficiently large to cover the whole of their\r\nbodies. The _clipei_ of the Romans only differed from the _ecu_ in\r\nshape; the former being entirely round, and the latter oval.\r\n\r\n=Ecuador=, or =Equator=. A South American republic, founded in 1831,\r\nwhen the Colombian republic was divided into three; the other two being\r\nVenezuela and New Granada. Gen. Franco was here defeated in battle by\r\nGen. Flores, August, 1860. Several insurrections have taken place in\r\nEcuador since 1860.\r\n\r\n=Edessa=, or =Callinhoe=. An ancient city of Mesopotamia. In 1144 the\r\nEdessenes were defeated by the Saracen chief Nur-ed-deen, and all who\r\nwere not massacred were sold as slaves. After many vicissitudes, it fell\r\nsuccessively into the hands of the sultans of Egypt, the Byzantines, the\r\nMongols, Turkomans, and Persians; the city was finally conquered by the\r\nTurks, and has ever since formed a portion of the Turkish dominion. Its\r\nmodern name is Oorfa.\r\n\r\n=Edge.= The thin or cutting part of a sword or sabre.\r\n\r\n=Edgehill.= An elevated ridge in Warwickshire, England, 7 miles\r\nnortheast from Banbury. Here was fought, on Sunday, October 23, 1642,\r\nthe first great battle of the civil war, between the royalist forces\r\nunder Charles I. and the Parliamentarians under the Earl of Essex.\r\nPrince Rupert, who led the right wing, charged with his cavalry the left\r\nwing of the Parliamentarians, broke it, and pursued it madly to Keinton.\r\nEssex with his force defeated the right wing of the royalists.\r\n\r\n=Edinburgh.= The metropolis of Scotland, situated about 1¹⁄₂ miles from\r\nthe Firth of Forth. It was taken by the Anglo-Saxons in 482; retaken by\r\nthe Picts in 695; city fortified and castle rebuilt, 1074; besieged by\r\nDonald Bane, 1093. The city was taken by the English in 1296;\r\nsurrendered to Edward III. in 1356. It was burnt by Richard II., 1385,\r\nand by Henry IV., 1401. A British force landed from a fleet of 200\r\nships, in 1544, and burned Edinburgh. The castle surrendered to Cromwell\r\nin 1650. The young Pretender occupied Holyrood September 17, 1745, and\r\nthe battle of Preston Pans took place September 21, 1745.\r\n\r\n=Effective.= Fit for service; as, an army of 30,000 effective (fighting)\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n=Efficient.= A thoroughly trained and capable soldier. It is also a term\r\nused in connection with the volunteers. A volunteer is said to be\r\nefficient when he has performed the appointed number of drills and fired\r\nthe regular number of rounds at the target, in the course of the year.\r\n\r\n=Egham.= A village in the northwest of Surrey, 18 miles west of London.\r\nIn the vicinity is Runnymede, a meadow on the Thames, where King John\r\nconferred with his barons before signing the Magna Charta in 1215.\r\n\r\n=Egypt.= A country in Northeast Africa. On the division of the Roman\r\nempire (395 A.D.) Egypt became a part of the dominions of Arcadius,\r\nruler of the Eastern empire. But, owing to religious feuds of the\r\nJacobites and Melchites, it became a province of Persia (616) for twelve\r\nyears. In 640 the governor, Makaukas, endeavored to make himself\r\nindependent, and invited the arms of the Arabs, and Amrou easily\r\nconquered Egypt. Although Alexandria was retaken by Constantine III.,\r\nthe Arabs drove him out and maintained their conquest, and Egypt\r\nremained an appendage of the caliphate. It afterwards passed into the\r\ndynasty of the Turks, and was administered by pashas. Constant\r\nrebellions of the Mamelukes, and the violence of contending factions,\r\ndistracted the country for more than two centuries. The most remarkable\r\nevent of this period was the French invasion by Bonaparte in 1798,\r\nwhich, by the conquest of Alexandria and the battle of the Pyramids\r\nagainst the Mamelukes, led to the entire subjection of the country, from\r\nwhich the French were finally expelled by the Turks and British in 1801,\r\nand the country restored to the Ottoman Porte. The rise of Mohammed Ali\r\nin 1806 imparted a galvanic prosperity to Egypt by the destruction of\r\nthe Mamelukes, the formation of a regular army, and the introduction of\r\nEuropean civilization. He considerably extended its boundaries, even\r\ninto Asia; but in 1840 he was dispossessed of his Asiatic conquests. The\r\ntreaty of London, however, in 1841, confirmed the viceroyalty of Egypt\r\nas a fief of the Ottoman empire to him and his descendants.\r\n\r\n=Ehrenbreitstein.= A town and fortress of Rhenish Prussia, situated on\r\nthe right bank of the Rhine, directly opposite Coblentz, with which it\r\nis connected by a bridge of boats. The fortress of Ehrenbreitstein\r\noccupies the summit of a precipitous rock 490 feet high, and has been\r\ncalled the Gibraltar of the Rhine, on account of its great natural\r\nstrength and its superior works. It is capable of accommodating a\r\ngarrison of 14,000 men, and provisions for 8000 men for ten years can be\r\nstowed in its vast magazines. Ehrenbreitstein was besieged in vain by\r\nthe French in 1688, but fell into their hands in 1799, after a siege of\r\nfourteen months. Two years after, the French, on leaving, at the peace\r\nof Lunéville, blew up the works. It was assigned, however, to Prussia by\r\nthe Congress of Vienna in 1814, and under that country was restored and\r\nthoroughly fortified. It is now one of the strongest forts in Europe.\r\n\r\n=Eighty-ton Gun.= A large Woolwich gun designed as an armament for the\r\n“Inflexible.” Its construction was authorized in March, 1874, and the\r\ngun was ready for proof in October, 1875. When first made it weighed 81\r\ntons, having a caliber of 14¹⁄₂ inches. It was bored during the progress\r\nof the experiments to 16 inches, and was given an enlarged chamber. The\r\nexperiments were conducted by the celebrated “Committee on Explosion.”\r\nSee ORDNANCE, RECENT HISTORY OF.\r\n\r\n=Eilau-Preussisch.= A town of Prussia, government of Königsberg. It is\r\nchiefly celebrated for the victory gained there by the French over the\r\nunited Prussian and Russian armies, February 8, 1807.\r\n\r\n=Einsiedeln.= A small town of Switzerland, in the canton of Schwytz. It\r\ncontains a fine abbey, which was rifled by the French in 1798.\r\n\r\n=Ejector.= The device used in breech-loading small-arms to throw out the\r\nmetallic cartridge-case after it is fired.\r\n\r\n=Ejector Spring.= The spring which operates an ejector.\r\n\r\n=El Arish.= A village of Lower Egypt on the Mediterranean, on the route\r\nfrom Egypt to Syria. It is but little more than a fort and a few houses,\r\nand was taken by the French in 1799; and here the French general Kleber\r\nsigned, in 1800, a convention with Sir Sydney Smith, engaging to leave\r\nEgypt with his troops.\r\n\r\n=Elath=, or =Eloth=. A seaport situated at the head of that gulf of the\r\nRed Sea, to which it gave its name. It was a fortified port in the time\r\nof Solomon; revolted against Joram; was retaken by Azariah; and was\r\neventually conquered by Rezui, and held by the Syrians till it became a\r\nRoman frontier town. Under the Mohammedan rule it rose for a while to\r\nsome importance, but has now sunk into insignificance.\r\n\r\n=Elba.= An island belonging to the kingdom of Italy, in the\r\nMediterranean Sea, between Corsica and the coast of Tuscany, from the\r\nlatter of which it is separated by a channel 5 miles in breadth. Elba\r\nhas been rendered famous in history from having been Napoleon’s place of\r\nexile from May, 1814, till February, 1815.\r\n\r\n=El Boden.= A mountain-range, near Ciudad Rodrigo, in Spain, where the\r\nBritish troops distinguished themselves against an overwhelming French\r\nforce in 1811.\r\n\r\n=Elbow-gauntlet.= An ancient piece of armor, a gauntlet of plate\r\nreaching to the elbow, adopted from the Asiatics in the 16th century.\r\n\r\n=Elbow-piece.= An ancient piece of armor, a metal plate used to cover\r\nthe junction of the rere-brace and rant-brace, by which the upper and\r\nlower half of the arm were covered.\r\n\r\n=Elchingen.= A village of Bavaria, on the Danube, 7 miles northeast from\r\nUlm. Here the Austrians were defeated by the French in 1805. For this\r\nvictory Marshal Ney received the title of Duke of Elchingen.\r\n\r\n=Electric light.= An intense light produced by passing an electric\r\ncurrent between points of carbon forming electrodes of the circuit.\r\nThere are many forms of the apparatus. It will be extensively used in\r\nfuture wars for lighting harbor channels, approaches to forts, etc.\r\n\r\n=Elements.= In a military sense, signify the first principles of\r\ntactics, fortification, and gunnery.\r\n\r\n=Elephant.= See PACK AND DRAUGHT ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n=Elevate, To.= Is to raise the muzzle of the cannon or rifle so that the\r\nlatter shall be directed at a point above that which it is intended\r\nshall be struck.\r\n\r\n=Elevating Arc.= In gunnery, is an arc attached to the base of the\r\nbreech parallel to the ratchets and graduated into degrees and parts of\r\na degree. A pointer attached to the _fulcrum_ points to the zero of the\r\nscale when the axis of the piece is horizontal. Elevations and\r\ndepressions are indicated by the scale. Besides the graduations on the\r\narc, the ranges (in yards) and charges for shot and shell are given.\r\n\r\n=Elevating Bar.= An iron bar used in elevating guns or mortars having\r\nratchets at the breech.\r\n\r\n=Elevating Screw.= The screw by means of which the breech of a cannon is\r\nraised, the result being to depress the muzzle.\r\n\r\n=Elevating Sight.= See SIGHT, ELEVATING.\r\n\r\n=Elevation.= In gunnery, is one of the elements of pointing, being the\r\nmovement of the axis of a piece in a vertical plane as distinguished\r\nfrom _direction_ or its movement horizontally. The elevation is usually\r\npositive,--that is, the gun is pointed above the horizontal. When it is\r\npointed below, it is said to be depressed. The word is also used to\r\nexpress degree, or as a synonym for _angle of elevation_. The sights or\r\nelevating apparatus of guns are graduated on the theory that the object\r\nis in the horizontal plane of the piece, or that the line of sight is\r\nhorizontal, which is not always the case in practice. When the elevation\r\nis determined by sights the angle of elevation is the angle between the\r\nline of sight and the axis of the piece, when these lines are in the\r\nsame vertical plane,--or the angle between the line of sight and a plane\r\ncontaining the axis of the piece and a horizontal line intersecting it\r\nat right angles, when they are not. The graduations of tangent scales\r\nand fixed breech-sights give this angle in degrees. The graduation of\r\nthe pendulum hausse gives the angle correctly only when the line of\r\nsight is horizontal. When the elevation is given by elevating arcs or\r\ngunner’s quadrant, the angle of elevation becomes the angle of fire, or\r\nthe angle which the axis of the piece makes with the horizontal.\r\nElevation is necessary to overcome the effect of gravity on the\r\nprojectile. The degree of elevation increases with the range. _In vacuo_\r\nthe elevation corresponding to the maximum range is 45°. In the air the\r\nangle of maximum range diminishes with the velocity and increases with\r\ndiameter and density of the ball. It is greater in mortars than in\r\nhowitzers, and greater in howitzers than in guns. In mortars it\r\napproximates to 42°; in guns it is about 37°.\r\n\r\n=Ellisburgh.= A village of Jefferson Co., N. Y. In 1814 an engagement\r\ntook place here between the Americans and British, in which the latter\r\nwere defeated.\r\n\r\n=Elmina.= A fortified town and seaport of West Africa, founded by the\r\nPortuguese in 1481; was the first European settlement planted on the\r\ncoast of Guinea. It was taken by the Dutch in 1637, and was ceded by\r\nthem to Portugal. It was burned by the British troops in 1873.\r\n\r\n=Elsass= (Fr. _Alsace_). One of the old German provinces, having the\r\nRhine on the east and the Vosges Mountains on the west. It was ceded to\r\nFrance in 1648; but after the Franco-German war was annexed by Prussia,\r\nunder treaty of May 10, 1871.\r\n\r\n=Elswick Compressor.= An arrangement for compressing friction plates\r\nused in the English navy to take up the recoil of gun-carriages upon\r\ntheir slides. The 7 friction plates arranged longitudinally under the\r\ncarriage and attached to its lower part, have alternating between them 6\r\nlong flat bars attached at their ends to the slide by bolts passing\r\nthrough them, but allowing them a side motion. The plates and bars are\r\ntightly clamped by short rocking levers, the lower ends of which act on\r\nthe outside plates. The levers are worked by collars on a threaded\r\nshaft, which catch their upper ends. The shaft is called the compressor\r\nshaft, and has a handle or crank on the outside of each cheek or\r\nbracket,--one is called the _adjusting lever_, the other the _compressor\r\nlever_. The first is used to give an initial compression to suit the\r\ncharge, the other is operated by the recoil being forced down by a\r\ntripper on the slide. Two forms of the compressor are used,--one for the\r\n_single plate_, the other for the _double-plate carriage_. In the\r\ndouble-plate carriage the adjusting lever can be set to any degree of\r\ncompression without causing any motion in the compressor shaft or lever.\r\n\r\n=Elswick Gun.= Armstrong gun (which see).\r\n\r\n=Elvas.= A strong frontier town of Portugal, in the province of\r\nAlemtejo, situated on a rocky hill, 10 miles northwest from Badajos. It\r\nis one of the most important strongholds in Europe. The arsenal and\r\nbomb-proof barracks are capable of containing 6000 or 7000 men. In 1808\r\nit was taken and held for five months by the French.\r\n\r\n=Emaum Ghaur.= In Scinde, was a strong fortress in the Thur or Great\r\nSandy Desert, separating that province from the rajpoot state of\r\nJessulmere. It was captured by Sir Charles Napier in January, 1843.\r\n\r\n=Embark.= To put or cause to go on board a vessel or boat; as, to embark\r\ntroops. To go on board of a ship, boat, or vessel; as, the troops\r\nembarked for Egypt.\r\n\r\n=Embarkation.= The act of putting or going on board of a vessel.\r\n\r\n=Embaterion.= A war-song of the Spartans, accompanied by flutes, which\r\nthey sung marching in time, and rushing on the enemy. The origin of the\r\nembaterion is lost in antiquity.\r\n\r\n=Embattle.= To arrange in order of battle; to draw up in array, as\r\ntroops for battle; also, to prepare or arm for battle.\r\n\r\n=Embattle.= To furnish with battlements. “_Embattled_” house.\r\n\r\n=Embattlement.= An indented parapet; battlement.\r\n\r\n=Embezzlement.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 60.\r\n\r\n=Emblazonry.= See BLAZONRY.\r\n\r\n=Emblee= (_Fr._).

A piece of iron, which grasps the trunnions of a\r\npiece of ordnance, when it is raised upon the boring machine, to widen\r\nits caliber.\r\n\r\n=Embrasure.= In fortification, is an opening in the parapet, or a hole\r\nin the mask wall of a casemate through which the guns are pointed. The\r\n_sole_ or bottom of the embrasure is from 2¹⁄₂ to 4 feet (according to\r\nthe size of the gun) above the platform upon which the gun stands.\r\nParapet embrasures are smallest at the interior opening, which is called\r\nthe mouth, and is from 1¹⁄₂ to 2 feet wide. The widening of the\r\nembrasure is what is called the _splay_. The sole slopes downward about\r\none in six. Its exterior line, or its intersection with the exterior\r\nslope, is usually made half the length of the sole. The line which\r\nbisects the sole is called the _directrix_. The sides are called cheeks.\r\nThe masses of earth between embrasures are called _merlons_. When the\r\ndirectrix makes an angle with the direction of the parapet, the\r\nembrasure is _oblique_. The embrasures of casemates have in horizontal\r\nsection a shape something like an hour-glass. The nearest part is called\r\nthe throat. This is sometimes closed with iron shutters.\r\n\r\n=Embrocher.= A vulgar term used among French soldiers to signify the act\r\nof running a man through the body; literally to _spit him_.\r\n\r\n=Emery.= A powder made by grinding a mineral,--corundum,--used by\r\nsoldiers for cleaning their arms.\r\n\r\n=Eminence.= A high or rising ground, which overlooks and commands the\r\nlow places about it. Such places, within cannon-shot of any fortified\r\nplace, are a great disadvantage, if the besiegers become masters of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n=Emir=, or =Emeer=. An Arabic word, equivalent to “ruler,” is a title\r\ngiven to all independent chieftains, and also to all the actual or\r\nsupposed descendants of Mohammed through his daughter Fatima. In former\r\ntimes, the title of Emir was borne by the leaders in the religious wars\r\nof the Mohammedans, and by several ruling families.\r\n\r\n=Emissary.= A person sent by any power that is at war with another, for\r\nthe purpose of creating disaffection among the people of the latter.\r\n\r\n=Emousser= (_Fr._). To blunt, to dull. In a military sense, it signifies\r\nto take off the four corners of a battalion, which has formed a square,\r\nand to give it, by those means, an octagon figure; from the different\r\nobtuse angles of which it may fire in all directions.\r\n\r\n=Emperor= (_Imperator_). Among the ancient Romans, signified the\r\ngeneral of an army, who, for some extraordinary success, had been\r\ncomplimented with this appellation. Subsequently it came to denominate\r\nan absolute monarch or supreme commander of an empire. In Europe, the\r\nfirst who bore the title was Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n=Empilement= (_Fr._). From _empiler_, to pile up. The act of disposing\r\nshot and shell in the most secure and convenient manner. This generally\r\noccurs in arsenals and citadels.\r\n\r\n=Emprise.= A hazardous attempt upon the enemy.\r\n\r\n=Encamp.= To form and occupy a camp; to halt on a march, spread tents,\r\nand remain for a night or for a longer time; as, an army or company.\r\n\r\n=Encampment.= The pitching of a camp.

There are _intrenched_ camps, where an army is\r\nintended to be kept some time, protected against the enemy; _flying_\r\ncamps, for brief occupation; camps of _position_, bearing relation to\r\nthe strategy of the commander; and camps of _instruction_, to habituate\r\nthe troops to the duties and fatigues of war.\r\n\r\n=Enceinte.= In fortification, denotes generally the whole area of a\r\nfortified place. Properly, however, it means a cincture or girdle, and\r\nin this sense the _enceinte_ signifies the principal wall or rampart\r\nencircling the place, comprising the curtain and bastions, and having\r\nthe main ditch immediately outside it.\r\n\r\n=Encircle.= To pass around, as in a circle; to go or come round; as, the\r\narmy encircled the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Encombrer= (_Fr._). In fortification, to fill up any hollow place, such\r\nas a stagnant lake, etc., with rubbish.\r\n\r\n=Encompass.= To describe a circle about; to go around; to encircle; to\r\ninclose; to environ; as, an army encompasses a city; a ship’s voyage\r\nencompasses the world.\r\n\r\n=Encounter.= A meeting with hostile purpose; hence, a combat; a battle.\r\n\r\n=Encounter.= To come against face to face; to engage in conflict with;\r\nto oppose; as, two armies encounter each other.\r\n\r\n=Encounters.= In military affairs, are combats or fights between two\r\npersons only.

It was first extensively introduced in 1853,\r\nand was used during the Crimean war. It had three grooves, with a twist\r\nof about one turn in 6 feet. Before the adoption of the Martini-Henry,\r\nlarge numbers of those guns were utilized by converting them into\r\nbreech-loaders on the Snider principle. The Enfield rifles, though very\r\nserviceable weapons, much better than the Belgian and Austrian arms\r\nimported to the United States during the civil war, were in almost every\r\nrespect inferior to the old Springfield (U. S.) rifle-musket, nearly of\r\nthe same caliber (.58), the Enfield being .577.

Some raise a weight, and others throw a\r\nshot, to certain heights and distances. As a test of gunpowder the\r\neprouvette is comparatively worthless, and it has been generally\r\nsuperseded by instruments for measuring the initial velocity obtained by\r\nfiring the powder in the particular gun for which it is intended. A\r\nshort mortar is, however, still used, to a certain extent, for testing\r\nthe power of modern blasting powders, such as the mixtures of\r\nnitro-glycerine. A very small charge and a heavy shot of chilled iron\r\nwhich enters two or three inches only into the mortar are used. The\r\nsquare roots of the ranges (other things being equal) give the relative\r\npowers of the different powders, nearly.\r\n\r\n=Equalize.= To render the distribution of any number of men equal as to\r\nthe component parts.

In the United States there is a strong tendency\r\ntowards discarding the knapsack; a roll made of the blanket, piece of\r\nshelter-tent, or overcoat, being frequently used instead. A clothing-bag\r\nis also sometimes used to take its place. The best manner of arranging\r\nand slinging the various articles carried, for the comfort and health of\r\nthe soldier, is still an open question. In future wars it is probable\r\nthat an intrenching tool will be added to the soldier’s equipment. The\r\nequipments for a cavalry soldier in the United States are very much the\r\nsame as for infantry.\r\n\r\n=Equipments, Signal.= The _flags_, _staffs_, _flying torches_, _fort\r\ntorches_, _flame shades_, _haversacks_, _telescopes_, etc., used in\r\nsignaling.

It was\r\nrecovered by the French, November 26, same year. It was again captured\r\nby the British in 1801 and 1810, and restored to the Dutch in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Eutaw Springs.= A small affluent of the Santee River, in South\r\nCarolina. On its banks was fought, September 8, 1781, the battle of\r\nthis name. Gen. Greene, determining to dispossess the British of their\r\nremaining posts, with about 2000 men attacked their forces under Col.\r\nStuart. The British were routed and fled; but finding in their flight\r\nsome objects affording shelter, rallied and repulsed their assailants,\r\nand Gen.

Hence they were likewise called _emereti_ and\r\n_beneficiarii_.\r\n\r\n=Evocation.= A religious ceremony which was observed among the Romans at\r\nthe commencement of a siege, wherein they solemnly called upon the gods\r\nand goddesses of the place to forsake it and come over to them. When any\r\nplace surrendered they always took it for granted that their prayer had\r\nbeen heard.\r\n\r\n=Evolutions.= Are the movements of troops in order to change position.\r\nThe object may be to maintain or sustain a post, to occupy a new post,\r\nto improve an attack, or to improve a defense. All such movements as\r\nmarching, countermarching, changing front, forming line, facing,\r\nwheeling, making column or line, defiling, deploying, etc., come under\r\nthe general heading of evolutions.\r\n\r\n=Evreux= (anc. _Mediolanum_). A city of France, capital of the\r\ndepartment of Eure. It has sustained several sieges, and was burned by\r\nHenry I. of England in 1119.\r\n\r\n=Examination, Boards of.= See BOARDS OF EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n=Exarchs.= Were appointed by the Byzantine emperors of the East, to\r\ngovern Central Italy after its conquest by Belisarius and Narses, 548.\r\nThey ruled from 568 to 752, when Eutychus, the last, was overcome by\r\nAstolphus the Lombard.\r\n\r\n=Exauctoratio.= In the Roman military discipline, differed from the\r\n_missio_, which was a full discharge, and took place after soldiers had\r\nserved in the army twenty years; whereas the exauctoratio was only a\r\npartial discharge; they lost their pay, indeed, but still kept under\r\ntheir colors or vexilla, though not under the aquila or eagle, which was\r\nthe standard of the legion; whence instead of _legionarii_, they were\r\ncalled _subsignani_, and were retained till they had either served their\r\nfull time, or had lands assigned them. The exauctoratio took place after\r\nthey had served seventeen years.\r\n\r\n=Excavation.= The art of cutting or otherwise making hollows in the\r\nearth; also the cavity formed.\r\n\r\n=Exchange.= The act of two officers changing regiments, battalions, or\r\nbatteries. The mutual giving up of an equal number of prisoners by\r\nhostile states or armies. In this sort of exchange an officer, according\r\nto his rank, is reckoned as equal to a certain number of men or of\r\nofficers of a lower grade than his own.\r\n\r\n=Excubiæ.= In ancient warfare, the watches and guards kept in the day by\r\nthe Roman soldiers. They differed from the _vigiliæ_, which were kept in\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n=Execution, Military.= Is the pillaging or plundering of a country by\r\nthe enemy’s army. Military execution also means every kind of punishment\r\ninflicted in the army by the sentence of a court-martial; which is of\r\nvarious kinds, including putting a soldier to death by shooting him,\r\nwhich is the ordinary punishment of deserters to the enemy, mutineers,\r\netc. This form of death is considered less disgraceful than hanging by\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\n=Exempt.= Not subject, not liable to. Men of certain age are exempt from\r\nserving in the militia. An aide-de-camp and brigade-major are exempt\r\nfrom all regimental duties while serving in those capacities. Officers\r\non courts-martial are sometimes exempt from all other duties until the\r\ncourt is dissolved.\r\n\r\n=Exercise.= The practice of all those motions and actions, together with\r\nthe whole management of arms, which are essential to the perfection of a\r\nsoldier, and the rendering him fit for service.\r\n\r\n=Exercise, Artillery.= Is the method of teaching the regiments of\r\nartillery the use and practice of all the various machines of war\r\nbelonging to that particular arm of the service.\r\n\r\n=Exon.= In England, an officer of the Yeomen of the Royal Guard; an\r\nexempt.\r\n\r\n=Exostre= (_Fr._).

There is usually one in each bastion.\r\n\r\n=Experiments.= The trials or applications of any kind of military\r\nmachines in order to ascertain their practical qualities and uses.\r\n\r\n=Expiration of Service.= The termination of a soldier’s contract of\r\nenlistment.\r\n\r\n=Explode.= To burst with a loud report; to detonate, as gunpowder, or a\r\nshell filled with powder or the like material.\r\n\r\n=Explosion.= The sudden enlargement of the volume of a body by its\r\nconversion into gas or vapor. (See EXPLOSIVES.) The explosion of powder\r\nmay be divided into three distinct parts, viz.: ignition, inflammation,\r\nand combustion, all of which see under their proper headings.\r\n\r\n=Explosives.= Substances the elements of which under certain conditions\r\nsuddenly undergo a chemical rearrangement into gases, giving rise to\r\ngreat pressures on surrounding bodies. Modern writers recognize two\r\ndifferent kinds of explosions,--_explosions of the 1st order_, or\r\n_detonations_, and _explosions of the 2d order_, or _rapid combustions_.\r\nDetonating explosions are practically instantaneous. The explosion is\r\nsupposed to be propagated by a vibration throughout the mass. Ordinary\r\nexplosions are propagated by inflammation. _Gunpowder_, which may be\r\ntaken as a type of explosives of the 2d order, burns at a certain rate,\r\ndepending upon the density. When a charge is fired the inflammation\r\nspreads from the point of ignition to all parts of the charge,--each\r\ngrain is successively enveloped and burned from surface to centre. The\r\n_velocity of inflammation_ is the greater in proportion to the degree of\r\nconfinement from the increased tension of the gases. The _velocity of\r\ncombustion_ is the rate at which the solid grains are burned. It is\r\nmeasured by the distance passed over by the burning surface (the line\r\nbeing taken perpendicular to the surface) in the unit of time. Time thus\r\nenters into the explosion of gunpowder and gives it its peculiar value\r\nas a ballistic agent.\r\n\r\nIn the _detonating explosives_, the case is very different. These bodies\r\nmay be supposed to be made up of molecules containing so many atoms of\r\ncarbon, oxygen, nitrogen, etc., so placed as to be held in a state of\r\nequilibrium by their mutual attractions and repulsions, but this\r\nequilibrium is unstable; that is to say, each atom has only a very small\r\narc of vibration in which the molecule is stable. If by any cause an\r\natom is forced beyond this limit the equilibrium of the whole mass is\r\ndestroyed, and the elements instantly rearrange themselves under the\r\ninfluence of the chemical affinities which obtain under the particular\r\nconditions of the explosion. This kind of explosion is brought about in\r\nvarious ways,--by percussion, concussion, heat, etc.,--some bodies being\r\nsusceptible to one mode of firing more than another. The theory which\r\noffers the best explanation of the various phenomena is that the\r\nmolecular balance is peculiarly susceptible to overturn by certain\r\nvibrations. The vibrations given out by the explosion of the fulminates\r\nseem to have the widest range in bringing about the detonation of\r\ndifferent substances. For this reason the fulminate of mercury is the\r\nuniversal _detonating agent_. Its own susceptibility to explosion by\r\nheat, percussion, and the electric spark especially fits it for this\r\nwork. Wet gun-cotton requires in addition to the fulminate a “primer” of\r\ndry gun-cotton.\r\n\r\n=Explosives, Composition of.= _Ordinary explosives_ of which gunpowder\r\nis the type are _mechanical mixtures_ of two essential ingredients,--one\r\na combustible, the other an oxidizing agent. The combustible is usually\r\ncarbon,--sometimes associated with hydrogen. It may be sulphur or any\r\nsubstance having a great affinity for oxygen. Organic substances\r\ncontaining carbon and hydrogen are frequently used. In the chemical\r\nreaction the carbon is oxidized to carbonic acid and the hydrogen to\r\nwater with the evolution of great heat.\r\n\r\nThe oxidizing substances ordinarily used are the nitrates and chlorates.\r\nMixtures containing nitrates are the most stable, since the nitrate is\r\ncomparatively slow to give up its oxygen. The chlorate mixtures are\r\nsensitive to friction and percussion, and explode with great quickness.\r\nMany of them are unsafe to handle. A new mode of preparing chlorate\r\nmixtures has been suggested which avoids this danger. A _combustible\r\nliquid_ is used, being absorbed in cakes or lumps of potassium or other\r\nchlorate.\r\n\r\n_Detonating explosives_ are _chemical compounds_. Among them are\r\n_chloride_ and _iodide of nitrogen_. Both are dangerous, violent\r\nexplosives of which no practical use has been made.\r\n\r\nThe _fulminates_ are salts of fulminic acid. The _fulminate of mercury_\r\nis the one in common use. See FULMINATES.\r\n\r\nThe _nitro-substitution_ compounds form a large class, comprising the\r\nmost important of the higher explosives. They are all formed by the\r\naction of nitric acid on organic substances containing oxygen, carbon,\r\nand hydrogen. This action is to replace hydrogen (H) in the organic\r\nsubstance by hyponitric acid (NO₂) (in the acid), equivalent for\r\nequivalent. Sulphuric acid is generally mixed with the nitric, though it\r\nplays no direct part in the reaction, being used to absorb the water\r\nformed and prevent the dilution of the nitric acid.\r\n\r\n_Nitro-glycerine_, the most powerful explosive in common use, is formed\r\nby the action of the acids on glycerine. See NITRO-GLYCERINE.\r\n\r\n_Nitro-starch_ and _nitro-mannite_ are analogous substances, formed by\r\nthe action of the acids on starch and sugar.\r\n\r\n_Gun-cotton_ is produced by the action of the acids on cotton-wool--a\r\nform of cellulose. See GUN-COTTON.\r\n\r\nThere are varieties of all these compounds produced, by the\r\nsubstitution of different numbers of equivalents of hyponitric acid, but\r\nthe names are specially given to the most highly nitrated forms.\r\n\r\n_Picric acid_, the salts of which form the well-known _picrates_, is\r\nmade by the action of the acids on carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nTo heighten the effect of the lower forms of nitro-substitution\r\ncompounds they are usually mixed with an oxidizing agent, such as\r\n_nitrate_ or _chlorate_, which supplies the deficient oxygen. This is\r\nexemplified in Schultz’s wood powder (which see), and Reeve’s gun felt.\r\n\r\nThe picrates are similarly treated. Ammonium picrate mixed with nitre\r\nforms Abel’s _picric_ powder (Burgess’s powder). This has been used as a\r\nbursting charge for shells.\r\n\r\nMixtures of two high explosives have also been used, as in glyoxiline,\r\ninvented by Prof. Abel, which is gun-cotton saturated with\r\nnitro-glycerine.\r\n\r\nExplosive effect depends upon three elements,--1st, the volume of the\r\ngases produced taken at a standard temperature; 2d, the heat evolved in\r\nthe chemical reaction; 3d, the time consumed in the development of the\r\ngases. Explosive effect is directly proportional to the first two of\r\nthese elements, and inversely proportional to the third. According to\r\nBertholet, nitro-glycerine gives out twice as much heat and three and a\r\nhalf times as much gas as an equal weight of gunpowder, but this gives\r\nno idea of their relative explosive effects, as the element of time in\r\nthe detonating explosives is so short that it cannot be calculated. So\r\nnearly is this element absent that we may consider these explosions as\r\nalmost perfect Impulsive Forces. To secure _ballistic effect_ requires\r\nthe gradual application of force. When motion is imparted to a body the\r\ninertia developed is inversely proportional to the time consumed in\r\nimparting it. This resistance to motion becomes enormously great when\r\nthe detonating explosives are used. For this reason their ballistic\r\neffect is small. The force which should give the projectile motion is\r\nexpended in producing molecular changes in both projectile and gun. The\r\nsame quality, however, fits them especially for blasting and torpedoes,\r\nwhere shattering effect is desirable.\r\n\r\n=Express Rifle.= A modern sporting rifle of great killing power, used in\r\nhunting large or dangerous animals. They were first introduced in\r\nEngland, and have become celebrated in the hands of African travelers\r\nand explorers. The principle consists in using large charges of powder\r\nand a light bullet, which gives a very high initial velocity and a\r\ntrajectory practically a right line for 150 or 200 yards, hence the term\r\n“Express.” To increase the killing power of the bullet it is made of\r\npure lead and has a hollow point. Upon striking game the bullet spreads\r\noutwardly, giving a fearful death-wound. Moreover, for specially ugly\r\ngame a small explosive cartridge can be dropped into the cavity in the\r\npoint, making it an explosive bullet. (See BULLETS, EXPRESS.) In England\r\na caliber as large as .57 is used for some Express rifles. In the United\r\nStates a caliber of .45 or .50 is considered sufficient.\r\n\r\n=Expugn.= To conquer; to take by assault.\r\n\r\n=Expugnable.= Capable of being expugned, forced or conquered.\r\n\r\n=Expugnation.= The act of taking by assault; conquest.\r\n\r\n=Expugner.= One who expugns or conquers.\r\n\r\n=Extend.= A term peculiarly applicable to light infantry movements, when\r\nthe files are frequently loosened, and the front of the line extended\r\nfor the purpose of skirmishing. When the divisions of a column are made\r\nto occupy a greater space of ground, they are said to extend their\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n=Exterior Crest.= The crest of the exterior slope of a parapet.\r\n\r\n=Exterior Form of Cannon.= See ORDNANCE, EXTERIOR FORM.\r\n\r\n=Exterior Side.= In fortification, is the side of the polygon, upon\r\nwhich a front of fortification is formed.\r\n\r\n=Exterior Slope.= In fortification, is the slope given to the outside of\r\na parapet.

These were carefully separated from the other forces borrowed\r\nfrom the confederate states, in order to prevent any treacherous\r\ncoalition between them. From among the extraordinarii a more choice body\r\nof men were drawn, under the name of _ablecti_. See ABLECTI.\r\n\r\n=Eylau=, or =Eilau=. Usually called Prussian Eylau, a town in the\r\ngovernment of Königsberg, celebrated for the battle fought here between\r\nNapoleon and the allies--Russians and Prussians--under Bennigsen,\r\nFebruary 8, 1807. The French force amounted to about 80,000, and the\r\nallies numbered 58,000, but were superior in artillery. The French\r\nclaimed the victory, chiefly because the allied forces, unable to\r\nrecruit their strength, were ordered to retreat from the field on the\r\nnight of the battle, and to retire upon Königsberg. The loss of the\r\nallies is estimated at about 20,000, while that of the French must have\r\nbeen considerably greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Face.= A term of varied application. In fortification, it is an\r\nappellation given to several parts of a fortress, as the _face of the\r\nbastion_, which is the two sides, reaching from the flanks to the\r\nsalient angles. The _prolonged or extended face_ is that part of the\r\nline of defense which is terminated by the curtain and the angle of the\r\nshoulder. Strictly taken, it is the line of defense _rayant_, diminished\r\nby the face of the bastion.\r\n\r\n=Face.= In tactics, is the turning of a soldier on his heels as a “right\r\nface”; also the word of command for the movement. _To face_ is to turn\r\non the heels.\r\n\r\n=Face of a Piece.= In gunnery, is the terminating plane perpendicular to\r\nthe axis of the bore.\r\n\r\n=Face of a Place.= In fortification, is the front comprehended between\r\nthe flanked angles of two neighboring bastions, composed of a curtain,\r\ntwo flanks, and two faces; and is sometimes called the _tenaille of the\r\nplace_.\r\n\r\n=Faces of a Square.= The sides of a battalion when formed in square.\r\n\r\n=Fachon.= An Anglo-Norman term for a sword or falchion.\r\n\r\n=Facing.= A covering, a plating.\r\n\r\n=Facings.= The movements of soldiers by turning on their heels to the\r\nright, left, right-about, left-about, etc. _To put one through one’s\r\nfacings_, is to examine into his elementary knowledge, to test his\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\n=Facings.= Are also the cuffs and collars of a military coat, and are\r\ngenerally of a different color from that of the coat.\r\n\r\n=Faction.= In ancient history, one of the troops or bodies of combatants\r\nin the games of the circus, especially of the horse-races.\r\n\r\n=Faction.= A term applied in an ill sense to any party in a state that\r\noffers uncompromising opposition to the measures of the government, or\r\nthat endeavors to excite public discontent upon unreasonable grounds.\r\n\r\n=Faction= (_Fr._). The duty done by a private soldier when he patrols,\r\ngoes the round, etc., but most especially when he does duty as a\r\nsentinel. The French usually say, _entrer en faction_, to come upon\r\nduty; _etre en faction_, to be upon duty; _sortir de faction_, to come\r\noff duty.\r\n\r\n=Factionnaire= (_Fr._). _Soldat factionnaire_, a soldier that does every\r\nspecies of detail duty. The term _factionnaire_ was likewise applicable\r\nto the duty done by officers in the old French service.\r\n\r\n=Faenza= (anc. _Faventia_). A town in Central Italy, 19 miles southwest\r\nof Ravenna. Faventia is noted in history as the place where Carbo and\r\nNorbanus were defeated with great loss by Metillus, the general of\r\nSulla, in 82 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Fæsulæ.= See FIESOLE.\r\n\r\n=Fag-end.= Is the end of any rope.

Here a severe battle\r\ntook place between the Federals under Gen. McClellan and the Confederate\r\narmy under Gen. Johnston, May 31-June 1, 1862, in which the latter were\r\ndefeated, although the former obtained no decisive results from their\r\nsuccess. The Union loss was estimated at 5500; the Confederate was\r\nsomewhat greater.\r\n\r\n=Fakir.= A word derived from the Arabic _fakhar_, and designating a\r\nmember of an order of mendicants or penitents, chiefly in India and the\r\nneighboring countries.

In 1712 the war was renewed, and\r\nterminated by the peace of Constantinople, April 16, 1712.\r\n\r\n=Falerii.= A city of ancient Etruria, which was situated west of the\r\nTiber. The inhabitants, who were called Falisci, joined with those of\r\nVeii in assisting the Fidenates against the Romans, and were among the\r\nmost dangerous enemies of Rome. In 241 B.C. the city was destroyed, and\r\na Roman colony was settled in the time of the triumvirs.\r\n\r\n=Falkirk.= A town of Scotland, in Stirlingshire. Sir William Wallace was\r\ndefeated in a battle near Falkirk by Edward I., and here, also, the\r\nroyal army was defeated by the adherents of the house of Stuart in 1746.\r\n\r\n=Falkoping.= A town of Sweden, near which, in 1338, Margaret, queen of\r\nDenmark, defeated Albert, king of Sweden, and took him prisoner.\r\n\r\n=Fall.= The surrender or capture of a place after it has been besieged.\r\n\r\n=Fall.= The rope rove through blocks, used with gins and shears for\r\nraising weights, and with the crab for moving them.\r\n\r\n=Fall.= The descent of a body by the attraction of the earth.\r\n\r\n=Fall Foul, To.= To attack; to make an assault.\r\n\r\n=Fall In.= A word of command for men to form in ranks, as in parade,\r\nline, or division, etc.\r\n\r\n=Falling Bodies, Laws of.= When a body falls freely _in vacuo_ it is\r\nactuated by a force which may be taken as constant, consequently its\r\nvelocity will be uniformly accelerated. The constant increment to the\r\nvelocity in one second is called the _acceleration_, and is a measure\r\nof the force. (See FORCE OF GRAVITY.) The velocity acquired at the end\r\nof a certain time will be found by multiplying the force of gravity by\r\nthe number of seconds. The laws of falling bodies are given by the\r\nfollowing equations:\r\n\r\n  _v_ = _gt_\r\n\r\n  _v_ = √(2_gh_)\r\n\r\n        _v_²\r\n  _h_ = -----\r\n        2_g_\r\n\r\nIn which _v_ is the velocity acquired, _h_ the height fallen through,\r\n_g_ the force of gravity, and _t_ the time in seconds. These laws are\r\napproximately true for dense or heavy bodies falling for a few seconds\r\nin the atmosphere. For longer periods, _v_ is less than that due to _h_\r\nunder the above laws.

After the expulsion of the Tarquins Fidenæ\r\nentered into a league with the Sabines and Latins to effect their\r\nrestoration, but the attempt proved abortive, and, deserted by their\r\nallies, the Fidenates were compelled to surrender to the Roman arms. The\r\ncity afterwards continued its struggles against Rome, but without\r\nsuccess, and, though there is no record of its destruction, it had\r\ndwindled into an insignificant village before the close of the Roman\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n=Fidentia= (now _Bargo S.

A body falling in _vacuo_ is uniformly\r\naccelerated, its velocity being continually increased. In the atmosphere\r\nthe case is different. Since the resistance of the air increases with\r\nsome power of the velocity greater than the square, it follows that at\r\nsome point in the descent the retardation becomes equal to the\r\nacceleration, and the body will move with uniform velocity. This is\r\ncalled “final velocity,” and is one of the most important elements in\r\nthe theory of projectiles. Every projectile has its own “final\r\nvelocity.” Other things being equal, that projectile is best which has\r\nthe greatest “final velocity.” The “final velocity” of a given\r\nprojectile will depend upon its weight on the one hand, and the extent\r\nof surface and the way it is presented to the air on the other. The\r\nextent and form of the surface directly opposed to the action of the air\r\nwill largely determine the resistance. The best form, as determined by\r\nthe experiments of Borda, is the _ogival_. The resistance, other things\r\nbeing the same, may be taken as proportional to the area of greatest\r\ncross-section. The weight in spherical projectiles is proportional to\r\nthe cube of this dimension. It follows from these general principles\r\nthat large projectiles are better than small, dense better than light,\r\nsolid better than hollow, in regard to their final velocities; moreover,\r\nthat oblong projectiles are better than spherical, ogival-headed oblong\r\nbetter than flat-headed, and long rifle projectiles better than short,\r\nin the same regard.\r\n\r\n=Finding.= Before a court-martial deliberates upon the judgment, the\r\njudge-advocate reads over the whole proceedings of the court; he then\r\ncollects the votes of each member, beginning with the youngest. The best\r\nmode of doing so is by slips of paper. The Articles of War require a\r\nmajority in all cases, and in cases of sentence of death two-thirds. It\r\nis not necessary to find a _general_ verdict of guilt or acquittal upon\r\nthe whole of every charge. The court may find the prisoner guilty of\r\npart of a charge, and acquit him of the remainder, and render sentence\r\naccording to their finding. This is a _special_ verdict.\r\n\r\n=Finland.= A Russian grand duchy; in the middle of the 12th century was\r\nconquered by the Swedes, who introduced Christianity. It was several\r\ntimes conquered by the Russians (1714, 1742, and 1808), and restored\r\n(1721 and 1743); but in 1809 they retained it by treaty.\r\n\r\n=Fire.= In the art of war, a word of command to soldiers of all\r\ndenominations to discharge their fire-arms, cannon, etc. It likewise\r\nexpresses a general discharge against an enemy. To be “under fire” means\r\nto be exposed to the attack of an enemy by cannonade or fusilade. The\r\nfire in artillery may be either direct, ricochet, rolling, plunging,\r\nhorizontal, or vertical, according to the nature of the projectile and\r\nthe angle of elevation. A fire is said to be _direct_, when the\r\nprojectile hits the object without striking any intermediate one;\r\n_ricochet_, when the projectile strikes the ground or water under a\r\nsmall angle of fall, penetrates obliquely to a certain distance, and is\r\nthen reflected at an angle greater than the angle of fall. This action\r\nmay recur frequently, depending, as it does, on the nature of the\r\nsurface struck, the initial velocity, shape, size, and density of the\r\nprojectile, and on the angle of fall. It is employed in siege-works to\r\nattain the face of a work in flank, or in reverse; and in the field, or\r\non water, when the object is large, and the distance is not accurately\r\nknown. The character of ricochet fire is determined by the angle of\r\nfall. It is _flattened_ when this angle does not exceed 4°, and\r\n_curvated_ when the angle is between 6° and 15°. Against troops the\r\nangle of fall should not exceed 3°. A particular kind of ricochet fire\r\ncalled _rolling_ is produced by placing the axis of the piece parallel,\r\nor nearly so, with the ground. It was formerly much used when the\r\nconditions were favorable in the field service, where it was very\r\neffective, as the projectile never passes at a greater distance above\r\nthe ground than the muzzle of the piece. The projectile was solid round\r\nshot; rifled projectiles are unsuited to this kind of fire. When the\r\nobject is situated below the piece, the fire is said to be _plunging_.\r\nThis kind of fire is particularly effective against the decks of\r\nvessels. Under low angles of elevation the fire of guns and howitzers is\r\nsaid to be _horizontal_. The fire of mortars under high angles of\r\nelevation is called _vertical_.\r\n\r\n=Fire-alarm.= An alarm given of a fire or conflagration. In military\r\nbarracks or camp, it is sounded on drum or bugle, or the discharge of\r\nfire-arms by the guard.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Angle of.= See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Fire-arms.= Every description of arms charged with powder and ball. See\r\nspecial headings.\r\n\r\n=Fire-arrow.= A small iron dart, furnished with a match impregnated with\r\npowder and sulphur, used to fire the sails of ships.\r\n\r\n=Fire-ball.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Fire-bavin.= A bundle of brushwood used in fire-ships.\r\n\r\n=Fire-bucket.= A bucket to convey water for extinguishing fires. To each\r\nset of quarters in a garrison there are allotted a certain number of\r\nfire-buckets.\r\n\r\n=Fire-cross.= An ancient token in Scotland for the nation to take up\r\narms.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Curved=, or =Curvated=. See FIRE.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Direct.= See FIRE.\r\n\r\n=Fire-eater.= One notoriously fond of being in action.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Effects of.= See PROJECTILES, EFFECTS OF.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Enfilade.= Fire in the direction of the length of a parapet or a\r\nline of troops.\r\n\r\n=Fire-engine.= A hydraulic or forcing pump for throwing water to\r\nextinguish fires.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Greek.= See GREEK FIRE.\r\n\r\n=Fire-hoops.= A combustible invented by the Knights of Malta to throw\r\namong their besiegers, and afterwards used in boarding Turkish galleys.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Line of.= See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Firelocks.= Were fire-arms formerly used by foot-soldiers; they were so\r\ncalled from their producing fire of themselves, by the action of the\r\nflint and steel. They were first made use of in 1690, but it is not\r\nascertained when they were first invented. About the middle of the last\r\ncentury a firelock was called, by military writers, _asnapbaan_, which\r\nbeing a low Dutch word, seems to indicate its being a Dutch invention.\r\n\r\n=Fire-master.= In the artillery, was a commissioned officer who gave the\r\ndirections and proportions of all ingredients for each composition\r\nrequired in fireworks, whether for the service of war, or for rejoicings\r\nand recreation.\r\n\r\n=Fire-master’s-mate.= In the artillery, a commissioned officer whose\r\nduty was to aid and assist the chief fire-master; and he was required to\r\nbe skilled in every kind of laboratory works.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Oblique.= That which strikes a parapet or a body of troops in a\r\nslanting direction.\r\n\r\n=Fire-pan.= A pan for holding or conveying fire; especially, the\r\nreceptacle for the priming in a gun.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Plane of.= See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Plunging.= See FIRE.\r\n\r\n=Fire-pot.= A small earthen pot, into which is put a charged grenade,\r\nand over that, powder enough to cover the grenade; the whole covered\r\nwith a piece of parchment, and two pieces of quick-match across lighted;\r\nit breaks and fires the powder, as also the powder in the grenade, which\r\nhas no fuze, that its operations may be quicker; it burns all that is\r\nnear it. These are no longer used.\r\n\r\n=Fire Rasant.= Is produced by firing the artillery and small-arms in a\r\nline parallel with those parts of the works you are defending.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Reverse.= Is that which strikes the rear of a parapet or body of\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Ricochet.= See FIRE.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Slant.= Is when the shot strikes the interior slope of the\r\nparapet, forming with it a horizontal angle, not greater than 30°.\r\n\r\n=Fire Stone.= A composition placed in a shell with the bursting charge,\r\nto set fire to ships, buildings, etc. It is made by stirring nitre,\r\nsulphur, antimony, and rosin in a mixture of melted tallow and\r\nturpentine. It is cast in molds made of rocket-paper. A priming of fuze\r\ncomposition is driven in a hole to insure its ignition.\r\n\r\n=Fire-swab.= The bunch of rope-yarns sometimes secured to the tampion,\r\nsaturated with water to cool the gun in action, and to swab up any\r\ngrains of powder.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Tables of.= In artillery, are tabulated statements for each\r\npiece, showing the range and time of flight for each elevation, charge\r\nof powder, and kind of projectile. Their purpose is to assist the\r\nartillerist in attaining his object without waste of time and\r\nammunition, and also to regulate his aim when the effect of shot cannot\r\nbe seen on account of the dust and smoke of the battle-field. The first\r\nfew shots generally produce a great effect on the enemy, and it is very\r\nimportant that they should be directed with some knowledge of their\r\nresults, which, in the field, can only be attained by experience, or\r\nfrom the data afforded by a table of fire. Tables of fire for different\r\nkinds of cannon may be found in the Ordnance and Artillery Manuals.\r\n\r\n=Fire, Vertical.= See FIRE.\r\n\r\n=Fire-workers.= In the British service, were formerly subordinate to the\r\nfire-master and his mate; had afterwards the rank of youngest\r\nlieutenants in the regiment of artillery, but now that rank is\r\nabolished, and they are all second lieutenants. They were supposed to be\r\nwell skilled in every kind of laboratory-work, which knowledge is an\r\nessential qualification in every officer of that branch of the service.\r\n\r\n=Fireworks.= Are various combustible preparations used in war. See\r\nPYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Firing.= The act of discharging fire-arms.\r\n\r\n=First Sergeant.= The ranking non-commissioned officer in a company. He\r\nhas immediate charge of all enlisted men of the company and company\r\nproperty; has command of it during formations, and calls the roll. He\r\nalso makes all details, keeps the roster, etc. See ORDERLY SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n=Fishguard.= A seaport town of South Wales, county of Pembroke. About\r\n2¹⁄₂ miles south of this town a French force of 1400 men, under Gen.\r\nTate, landed on February 22, 1797, and next day surrendered to a few\r\nmilitia and volunteers not half their number.\r\n\r\n=Fishtail Wind.= A term in target practice with small-arms for a rear\r\nwind which is variable in direction.\r\n\r\n=Fish Torpedoes.= See TORPEDOES.\r\n\r\n=Fissure.= A narrow chasm where a small breach has been made, as in a\r\nfort, citadel, etc.\r\n\r\n=Five Forks.= A name given to a locality in Dinwiddie Co., Va., the\r\njunction of the White Oak and Ford’s road with the one leading to\r\nDinwiddie Court-house. An important battle was fought here April 1,\r\n1865. The possession of this radiating centre was one of great strategic\r\nimportance, inasmuch as by Ford’s road the Southside Railroad could be\r\nreached, and, indeed, the whole country which the intrenched Confederate\r\nlines were intended to cover. The attempt to gain possession of this\r\nposition had been made (March 30-31) by Gen. Sheridan, with momentary\r\nsuccess (March 31), during the absence of most of the Confederate force,\r\nengaged in fighting Warren on the White Oak road, but which now being\r\nrecalled, regained possession, driving Sheridan back towards Dinwiddie\r\nCourt-house. On the morning of April 1 Sheridan renewed the attempt, and\r\nafter a day of very severe fighting compelled the surrender of nearly\r\nall the Confederate force, pursuing such as escaped till after dark.\r\nOver 5000 prisoners were captured with 5 guns. The Union loss was not\r\nabove 1900 all told. The effect of this decisive battle was to\r\ndetermine Lee to abandon Petersburg, which he did undercover of night\r\n(April 2), but not before his entire outer line of works had been\r\ncarried during the day. One week later Lee surrendered his army at\r\nAppomattox Court-house.\r\n\r\n=Fix Bayonets.= A word of command in the manual exercise, whereby the\r\nbayonets are fixed on the rifles.\r\n\r\n=Fixed Ammunition.= Consists of a projectile and its cartridge which are\r\nattached to the same block of wood called a _sabot_. See ORDNANCE,\r\nAMMUNITION FOR.\r\n\r\n=Flag, Black.= A flag of a black color, displayed as a sign that no\r\nmercy will be shown to the vanquished, or that no quarter will be given.\r\n\r\n=Flag, Garrison.= In the U. S. army the garrison flag is the national\r\nflag, and is 36 feet fly and 20 feet hoist. It is furnished only to very\r\nimportant posts, or those having large garrisons, and is hoisted only on\r\ngala days and great occasions.\r\n\r\n=Flag of the Prophet= (_Sanjak-Sheriff_). Is the sacred banner of the\r\nMohammedans. It was originally of a white color, and was composed of the\r\nturban of the Koreish, captured by Mohammed. A black flag was, however,\r\nsoon substituted in its place, consisting of the curtain that hung\r\nbefore the door of Ayeshah, one of the prophet’s wives. This flag is\r\nregarded by the Mohammedans as their most sacred relic; it was brought\r\ninto Europe by Amurath III. It was covered with forty wrappings of silk,\r\ndeposited in a costly casket, and preserved in a chapel in the interior\r\nof the seraglio, where it is guarded by several emirs, with constant\r\nprayers. The banner unfolded at the commencement of a war, and likewise\r\ncarefully preserved, is not the same, although it is believed by the\r\npeople to be so.\r\n\r\n=Flag of Truce.= A white flag carried by an officer sent to communicate\r\nwith the enemy. The flag signifies his errand, but the enemy are not\r\nbound to receive him, though it would be a violation of the rules of war\r\nto injure the messenger, unless he persisted in his endeavor to\r\ncommunicate after due warning given. The term is often extended to the\r\nparty which accompanies the flag, which consists generally of an\r\nofficer, a trumpeter or bugler, who sounds to attract attention, and\r\nsometimes of an additional soldier who carries the flag.\r\n\r\n=Flag, Post.= In the U. S. army, is the national flag, and is 20 feet\r\nfly and 10 feet hoist; it is furnished to all posts garrisoned by\r\ntroops, and is hoisted only in pleasant weather.\r\n\r\n=Flag, Red.= Is frequently used by revolutionists as an emblem of\r\ndefiance. It is used in the U. S. service as a danger-signal at target\r\npractice, and on a man-of-war as a signal that the ship is receiving or\r\ndischarging her powder.\r\n\r\n=Flags.= See COLORS, STANDARDS, etc.\r\n\r\n=Flags.= The national flag of the United States consists of 13\r\nhorizontal stripes, alternately red and white; the union to consist of\r\n20 stars, white, in a blue field; one star to be added to the union on\r\nthe admission of every new State; the addition to be made on the 4th day\r\nof July succeeding such admission. There are flags which are symbols of\r\nindividual authority. Among such are royal standards, flag-officers’\r\nflags, etc. An admiral’s flag is usually the flag of the country which\r\nsuch admiral serves, with the exception of the union. The flag of the\r\nadmiral, vice-admiral, and rear-admirals of the United States is\r\nrectangular and consists of 13 alternate red and white stripes. The\r\nadmiral hoists this at the main; the vice-admiral at the fore; the\r\nrear-admiral at the mizzen. Should there be two rear-admirals present,\r\nthe junior hoists a flag at the mizzen similar to the one described,\r\nwith the addition of two stars in the upper left-hand corner. The\r\ncommodore’s flag differs from that of the admiral’s in form alone, it\r\nbeing a swallow-tail instead of a rectangular. Should the President go\r\nafloat, the American flag is carried in the bows of his barge or hoisted\r\nat the main of the vessel on board of which he may be. In foreign\r\ncountries the royal standard is worn at ceremonies in honor of the\r\nsovereign or at which the sovereign may be present. The highest flag in\r\nthe British navy is the anchor and cable, the next is the union, and the\r\nlowest the blue. Flags are said to be at half-mast when they are hoisted\r\nbut half the height at which they are ordinarily worn, and in this\r\nposition designate mourning. _To strike or lower the flag_, to pull it\r\ndown upon the cap, in token of respect, submission, or, in an\r\nengagement, of surrender. _Dipping the flag_ is a salute to a fort or\r\npassing vessel by lowering it slightly and hoisting it again.\r\n\r\n=Flag-staff.= The staff on which a flag is fixed.\r\n\r\n=Flag, Storm.= In the U. S. army, is the national flag, and is 8 feet\r\nfly and 4 feet 2 inches hoist; it is furnished to all occupied military\r\nposts and national cemeteries, and will be hoisted in stormy or windy\r\nweather. It is also to be used as a recruiting flag.\r\n\r\n=Flam.= A peculiar tap upon a drum. This word was formerly made use of\r\nin the British service, signifying a particular tap or beat upon the\r\ndrum, according to which each battalion went through its firings or\r\nevolutions.\r\n\r\n=Flambeau.= A kind of torch made of thick wicks, covered with wax, and\r\nused in the streets at night, at illuminations and in processions.\r\n\r\n=Flanchière= (_Fr._). A part of horse armor which covered the flanks and\r\ncroup as far as the houghs.\r\n\r\n=Flanconade.= In fencing, a thrust in the side.\r\n\r\n=Flanders.= The principal part of the ancient Belgium, which was\r\nconquered by Julius Cæsar, 51 B.C. It became part of the kingdom of\r\nFrance in 843, and was governed by counts subject to the king, from 862\r\ntill 1369. Flanders was subjected successively to Burgundy (1384),\r\nAustria (1477), and Spain (1555). In 1580 it declared its independence,\r\nbut afterwards returned to its allegiance to the house of Austria. In\r\n1792 the French invaded imperial Flanders, and occupied it till 1814. In\r\n1814 a portion of Flanders was given to the king of the Netherlands.\r\nSince the revolution of 1831, it has belonged to Belgium.\r\n\r\n=Flank.= A word of very extensive application in military matters. It\r\nliterally means sides or ends of any fortification, or encampment, or\r\nbody of troops. Thus a writer has described flanks as “certain\r\nproportions of offensive or defensive forces extended to the right and\r\nleft of a main body.” In fortification the term means any part of the\r\nwork defending another by a fire along the outside of its parapet.\r\n\r\n=Flank Casemate Carriage.= Is a gun-carriage which is especially adapted\r\nto the mounting of the 24-pound iron howitzer in the flanks of\r\ncasemate-batteries, for defending the ditch.\r\n\r\n=Flank Company.= A certain number of men drawn up on the right or left\r\nof a battalion. Thus when there are grenadiers they compose the right,\r\nand the light infantry the left flank company. Grenadiers and light\r\ninfantry are generally called flank companies, whether attached or not\r\nto their battalions; rifle corps are always flankers.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Concave.= Is that which is made in the arc of a semicircle\r\nbending outwards.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Covered.= The platform of the casemate, which lies hid in the\r\nbastion. These retired flanks were a great defense to the opposite\r\nbastion and passage of the ditch; because the besiegers could not see\r\nnor easily dismount their guns.\r\n\r\n=Flank Defense Carriage.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, SEA-COAST\r\nCARRIAGES.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Directing.= In drill, that by which companies march,--_i.e._,\r\nthat at which is placed the guide, who directs and regulates the march.\r\n\r\n=Flank En Potence.= Is any part of the right or left wing formed at a\r\nprojecting angle with the line. See POTENCE.\r\n\r\n=Flank Files.= Are the two first men on the right and the two last men\r\non the left of a battalion, company, etc. When a battalion is drawn up\r\nthree deep, its flank files consist of three men, or, as the French call\r\nit, file and demi-file. When four deep, the flank files are termed\r\ndouble files; so that a column formed from any of these alignments will\r\nhave all its relative flank files, be the depth of formation what it\r\nmay.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Inner.= That which is nearest the point on which a line rests,\r\nor which is farthest from the enemy. In drill, it is that nearest the\r\npoint from which the line is dressed.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Leading.= When the line breaks into column in order to attack an\r\nenemy, it is the flank which must always preserve the line of _appui_ in\r\nall movements in front. The first battalion, or company of every column\r\nwhich conducts, is called the head or leading flank of that column.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Oblique.= Or second flank, in fortification; that part of the\r\ncurtain from whence the face of the opposite bastion may be discovered,\r\nand is the distance between the lines _rasant_ and _fichant_, which are\r\nrejected by some engineers, as being liable to be ruined at the\r\nbeginning of a siege, especially when made of sandy earth. This second\r\nflank defends very obliquely the opposite face, and is to be used only\r\nin a place attacked by an army without artillery.\r\n\r\n=Flank of a Bastion.= In fortification, that part which joins the face\r\nto the curtain, comprehended between the angle of the curtain and that\r\nof the shoulder, and is the principal defense of a place. Its use is to\r\ndefend the curtain, the flank, and the face of the opposite bastion, as\r\nwell as the passage of the ditch; and to batter the salient angles of\r\nthe counterscarp and glacis, from whence the besiegers generally ruin\r\nthe flanks with their artillery.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Outward.= Of a line or battalion, the extreme file on the right\r\nor left of a division, subdivision, or section, according to the given\r\nfront, when the battalion is at close or open column, and which is the\r\nfarthest wheeling point from line into column, or from column into line.\r\nIt is likewise called the _reverse_ flank.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Prolonged.= In fortification, is the extending of the flank from\r\nthe angle of the epaule to the exterior side, when the angle of the\r\nflank is a right one.\r\n\r\n=Flank, Second.= See FLANK, OBLIQUE.\r\n\r\n=Flank, To.= In fortification, is to erect a battery which may play upon\r\nan enemy’s works on the right or left without being exposed to his line\r\nof fire. In evolutions, to take such a position in action as either to\r\nassist your own troops, or to annoy those of your enemy by attacking\r\neither of his flanks, without exposing yourself to all of his fire. To\r\n_outflank_, a manœuvre by which an army, battalion, troop, or company\r\noutstretches another, and gets upon both or either of his flanks. In an\r\nextensive acceptation of the term, when applied to locality, it means to\r\npossess any range or opposite parts, or territory, whence you might\r\ninvade your neighbors.\r\n\r\n=Flanker.= A fortification jutting out so as to command the side or\r\nflank of an enemy marching to the assault or attack. Riflemen and all\r\nlight troops are also called flankers, from the fact of their acting on\r\nthe flanks.\r\n\r\n=Flanker, To= (Fr. _flanquer_). In fortification, to fortify the walls\r\nof a city with bulwarks or countermines.\r\n\r\n=Flanking.= Is the same in fortification as defending.\r\n\r\n=Flanking Angle.= In fortification, that composed of the two lines of\r\ndefense, and pointing toward the curtain. See TENAILLE.\r\n\r\n=Flanking Party.= Any body of men detached from the main army to act\r\nupon the flanks of an enemy. See FLANKER.\r\n\r\n=Flanks of a Frontier.= Are certain salient points in a national\r\nboundary, strong by nature and art, and ordinarily projecting somewhat\r\nbeyond the general line. The effect of these flanks is to protect the\r\nwhole frontier against an enemy, as he dare not penetrate between, with\r\nthe risk of their garrisons, reinforced from their own territories,\r\nattacking his rear, and cutting off communication between him and his\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n=Flash.= The flame which issues from any fire-arm or piece of ordnance\r\non its being fired.\r\n\r\n=Flash in the Pan.= An explosion of gunpowder without any communication\r\nbeyond the vent. When a piece is loaded, and, upon the trigger being\r\ndrawn, nothing but the priming takes fire, that piece is said to flash\r\nin the pan.\r\n\r\n=Flask, Powder-.= A measure formerly made of horn, used to carry powder\r\nin, with the measure of the charge of the piece on the top of it.\r\n\r\n=Flathead Indians.= A tribe of aborigines, so called from the practice\r\nwhich prevailed among them of binding some solid substance on the\r\nforeheads of their children so as to cause a depression of the skull.\r\nThey are located on an agency in Montana. See INDIANS AND THEIR\r\nAGENCIES.\r\n\r\n=Flaw.= A crack or small opening in a gun or its carriage is so called.\r\n\r\n=Fleau d’Armes= (_Fr._). An ancient offensive weapon; the part used for\r\nstriking was armed with sharp iron spikes.\r\n\r\n=Flèche.= Literally an arrow; but applied in fortification to a work\r\nresembling a redan, except that it is raised upon the terre-plein\r\nwithout a ditch. It is in short a field-work, having faces and small\r\nflanks hastily run up to shelter a small number of men, and form an\r\noutwork to some more powerful fortification.\r\n\r\n=Fleece, Order of the Golden.= One of the most eminent orders of\r\nknighthood in Europe, was founded in 1430 by Philip III., duke of\r\nBurgundy. By its foundation his successors were declared hereditary\r\ngrand-masters; and thus the title passed to the imperial house of\r\nAustria with the Burgundian inheritance, and thence to the Spanish line\r\nof the same house after the death of the emperor Charles V. When the\r\nSpanish Netherlands, however, became Austrian, and the Bourbons became\r\nmonarchs of Spain, the grand-mastership was claimed by the archdukes of\r\nAustria. Hence at present the Spanish and Austrian sovereigns alike\r\nconfer the order, and at both courts it gives the highest rank.\r\n\r\n=Fletch, To.= To feather an arrow.\r\n\r\n=Fletcher.= The man who made or repaired the military bows was so\r\ncalled. Also called _bowyer_.\r\n\r\n=Fleur-de-lis= (_Fr._). This celebrated emblem is derived from the white\r\nlily of the garden, or from the flag or iris. The Franks of old had a\r\ncustom at the proclamation of their king, to elevate him upon a shield\r\nor target, and place in his hand a reed or flag in blossom, instead of\r\na sceptre; and from that time the kings of the first and second race in\r\nFrance are represented with sceptres in their hands like the flag with\r\nits flowers, these flowers subsequently becoming the armorial bearings\r\nof France. In later times their arms were azure, three fleur-de-lis\r\n_or_. Many English and Scotch families bear the fleur-de-lis in some\r\nportion of their arms, and generally with some reference to France.\r\n\r\n=Fleurus.= A small town in Belgium, in the province of Hainault. It has\r\nbeen the scene of several conflicts, the last and most important being\r\nthe battle fought June 26, 1794, between the army of the French republic\r\nunder Jourdan and the allies under the Prince of Saxe-Coburg. The allied\r\nforces were compelled for a time to evacuate Flanders.\r\n\r\n=Flight.= Is used figuratively for the swift retreat of an army or any\r\nparty from a victorious enemy. It is likewise applicable to missile\r\nweapons or shot; as, a flight of arrows, a flight of bombs, etc.\r\n\r\n=Flight, Time of.= In gunnery, the flight of a shot or shell is the time\r\nduring which it is passing through the air from the piece to the first\r\ngraze.\r\n\r\n=Flight, To Put to.= To force your enemy to quit the field.\r\n\r\n=Flint.= In the flint-lock musket, the stone which was fixed to the cock\r\nor gun-lock by which the sparks were elicited that discharged the piece.\r\n\r\n=Flint-lock.= A musket lock with a flint fixed in the hammer for\r\nstriking on the cap of the pan; also the musket itself.\r\n\r\n=Flint Weapons.= Believed to have been used by the primitive\r\ninhabitants, have from time to time, in more or less number, been turned\r\nup with the plow and the spade, and dug out from ancient graves,\r\nfortifications, and dwelling-places. They do not differ in any material\r\nrespect from the flint weapons still in use among uncivilized tribes in\r\nAsia, Africa, America, etc. The weapons of most frequent occurrence are\r\narrow-heads, spear-points, dagger-blades, and axe-heads, or celts.\r\n\r\n=Flo.= An arrow was formerly so called.\r\n\r\n=Floating Batteries.= These are used in defending harbors, or in attacks\r\non marine fortresses. The most remarkable instance of their employment\r\nwas by the French and Spaniards against Gibraltar, in the memorable\r\nsiege which lasted from July, 1779, to February, 1783.

In 1585 the Prince of Orange pledged it to Queen Elizabeth as\r\nsecurity for a loan which she made to the people of the Netherlands in\r\ntheir struggle against Philip II. of Spain. The English held it till\r\n1616. At the commencement of the 19th century it came into the\r\npossession of the French, and in 1809 was bombarded by the British\r\ncomposing the Walcheren expedition, under Lord Chatham, when it suffered\r\nseverely.

Now obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Fontainebleau.= A town and parish of France, in the department of the\r\nSeine and Marne, 37 miles southeast from Paris. There is a celebrated\r\nroyal palace here encompassed by parks and gardens, mentioned in\r\nhistory, ever since the 13th century, as the residence of the monarchs\r\nof France. This place was entered by the Austrians, February 17, 1814.\r\nHere Napoleon resigned his dignity, April 4, and bade farewell to his\r\narmy, April 20, 1814.\r\n\r\n=Fontenoy.= A village in Belgium, in the province of Hainaut, 5 miles\r\nsouthwest of Tournay. Here was fought the most famous contest in the War\r\nof the Austrian Succession, on May 11, 1745, between the French under\r\nMarshal Saxe and the allies (English, Dutch, and Austrians) under the\r\nDuke of Cumberland. After a hard-fought battle the allies were forced to\r\nretreat. The loss on both sides was stated at about 7000 men.\r\n\r\n=Food.= Food has two functions, building up the body, and supplying it\r\nwith force. Substances used as food may be divided into elements which\r\nare oxidizable and those conducive to chemical changes. Milk contains\r\nall the necessary elements in the best form. The nourishing elements of\r\nfoods are usually classed under the heads of albuminates, fats,\r\ncarbo-hydrates, and salts. In regard to the part played by the\r\ncondiments used in flavoring and seasoning, and such things as tea,\r\ncoffee, chocolate, alcohol, etc., little is positively known beyond the\r\nfact that some of them are useful in exciting the salivary and\r\nalimentary secretions. The amount of food necessary to health and vigor\r\nvaries with the kind and amount of occupation, the character of the\r\nclimate, and specifically with the individual.

 --------------------------------+------+-------+-----+-------+------\r\n\r\n=Foot.= The foot-soldiers; the infantry, usually designated as the foot,\r\nin distinction from the cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Foot.= To gain or lose ground foot by foot, is to do it regularly and\r\nresolutely; defending everything to the utmost extremity, or forcing it\r\nby dint of art or labor.\r\n\r\n=Foot Artillery.= Artillery troops serving on foot. Heavy artillery.\r\n\r\n=Foot-band.= A band of infantry.\r\n\r\n=Foot-bank.= See BANQUETTE.\r\n\r\n=Foot-boards.= The transverse boards on the front of a limber, on which\r\nthe cannoneers rest their feet when mounted.\r\n\r\n=Foot-fight.= A conflict by persons on foot; in opposition to a fight on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\n=Foot Guards.= Guards of infantry. The flower of the British infantry,\r\nand the garrison ordinarily of the metropolis, comprise 3 regiments, the\r\nGrenadier, Coldstream, and Scots Fusilier Guards, in all 7 battalions,\r\nand 6307 officers and men of all ranks.\r\n\r\n=Footing.= To be on the same footing with another, is to be under the\r\nsame circumstances in point of service; to have the same number of men,\r\nand the same pay, etc.\r\n\r\n=Footman.= A soldier who marches and fights on foot.\r\n\r\n=Foot-pound.= In mechanics, is the unit of work. It is simply a\r\ncontraction for “one pound raised through a height of one foot.” See\r\nWORK.\r\n\r\n=Foot-soldier.= A soldier that serves on foot.\r\n\r\n=Foot-ton.= In England the power of modern ordnance is estimated by the\r\nenergy of the shot in foot-tons, divided by the number of inches in the\r\nshot’s circumference. The formula for calculating it is\r\n\r\n         _WV_²\r\n  _E_ = -------\r\n        2π_r.g_\r\n\r\nin which _W_ is the weight of the shot in tons (English), _V_ is the\r\nvelocity, 2π_r_, the circumference of the shot in inches, and _g_ the\r\nforce of gravity;\r\n\r\n  _WV_²\r\n  -----\r\n   _g_\r\n\r\nis the living force of the shot, and is equal to twice the quantity of\r\nwork it is capable of doing. This divided by the circumference gives a\r\nvery fair estimate of its power in penetrating armor, as the resistance\r\nto penetration increases with the size of the projectile. This unit is\r\nalso used to estimate the resisting power of armor-plating against shots\r\nof various sizes.\r\n\r\n=Forage.= The hay, corn, fodder, and oats required for the subsistence\r\nof the animals in the army. The allowance of forage in the U. S. army is\r\nfixed by regulations at 14 pounds of hay and 12 of grain to each horse,\r\nand 14 pounds of hay and 9 of grain to each mule in the public service.\r\nGenerals, field-officers, staff-officers, and cavalry officers receive\r\nforage for a certain number of private horses while actually kept in\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Forage.= To collect supplies both for man and beast, from an enemy by\r\nforce, from friends by impressment, but giving to friends receipts, to\r\nbe paid ultimately.\r\n\r\n=Forage Cap.= A small low cap worn by soldiers when not in full dress.\r\n\r\n=Forage-master.= See WAGON-MASTER.\r\n\r\n=Foragers.= A detachment of soldiers who forage or collect stores for an\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n=Foraging.= Is properly the collection of forage or other supplies\r\nsystematically in towns or villages, or going with an escort to cut\r\nnourishment for horses in fields. Such operations frequently lead to\r\nengagements with the enemy. Foraging parties are furnished with\r\nreaping-hooks and cords. The men promptly dismount, make bundles with\r\nwhich they load their horses, and are prepared for anything that may\r\nfollow. The word foraging is sometimes inaccurately used for marauding.\r\n\r\n=Forbach.= A small town of France, in the department of the Moselle, now\r\na part of German Lorraine. It was occupied by the Prussians, January 10,\r\n1814. During the Franco-Prussian war it was taken by the German generals\r\nVon Goeben and Von Steinmetz, after a fierce contest, in which the\r\nFrench were defeated and compelled to retreat, August 6, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Forcat.= A rest for a musket in ancient times.\r\n\r\n=Force.= In its military application, signifies an army of all\r\nbranches,--artillery, cavalry, and infantry. It is sometimes used in the\r\nplural number, but with the same signification; as, “commander of the\r\nforces;” and occasionally we find the word used in another sense, thus,\r\n“He is in great force.” To force, in broadsword exercise, is to break an\r\nadversary’s sword-guard, and either wound him or expose him to a wound.\r\n\r\n=Force.= To obtain or win by strength; to take by violence or struggle;\r\nspecifically, to capture by assault; to storm, as a fortress. Also to\r\nimpel, drive, wrest, extort, get, etc., by main strength or violence;\r\nwith a following adverb, as _along_, _away_, _from_, _into_, _through_,\r\n_out_, etc.\r\n\r\n=Force.= To provide with forces; to reinforce; to strengthen by\r\nsoldiers; to garrison.\r\n\r\n=Force of Gravity.= The force by virtue of which all terrestrial bodies\r\nfall to the earth when unsupported. As a terrestrial force it may be\r\nconsidered constant for the same place, but as it is practically the\r\nresultant of the earth’s attraction and the centrifugal force arising\r\nfrom its rotation, and as the earth is neither homogeneous nor a perfect\r\nsphere, it will vary slightly with the latitude, being greatest at the\r\npoles and least on the equator, and it will also vary in an\r\ninsignificant degree from place to place in the same latitude. Gravity\r\nis distinguished in dynamics as the only constant force with which we\r\nhave to do. It differs also from all others in this, that its measure is\r\nindependent of mass. Other forces are measured by the product of the\r\nmass moved into the velocity imparted in the unit of time; but as\r\ngravity impresses the same velocity upon all masses, great or small,\r\nmass is properly omitted in its measure. The velocity impressed by it\r\nduring each second of its action, or the _acceleration_, is about\r\n32.1808 feet in latitude 45°, about 32.0977 at the equator, and 32.2629\r\nat the poles. This number in gunnery is indicated by the algebraic\r\nsymbol _g_. Its exact value at any place is best determined by the\r\nlength of the simple second’s pendulum at that place. The value for _g_\r\nfor bodies falling in the air is very nearly true for dense substances\r\npresenting small surfaces, when the fall is limited by a few seconds.\r\nFor the ordinary time of flight of projectiles it can be used without\r\nmaterial error.\r\n\r\n=Force, To.= To force an enemy to give battle, is to render the\r\nsituation of an enemy so hazardous, that whether he attempts to quit his\r\nposition, or endeavors to keep it, his capture or destruction must be\r\nequally inevitable. In either of such desperate cases, a bold and\r\ndetermined general will not wait to be attacked, but resolutely advance\r\nand give battle, especially if circumstances should combine to deprive\r\nhim of the means of honorable capitulation. To _force_ a passage, is to\r\noblige your enemy to retire from his fastnesses, and to open a way into\r\nthe country which he had occupied. This may be done either by _coup de\r\nmain_, or renewal of assaults. In either case, the advancing body should\r\nbe well supported and its flanks be secured with the most jealous\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n=Forced.= Exerted to the utmost; urged; hence, strained, urged to\r\nexcessive or unnatural action; as, a forced march.\r\n\r\n=Forces, Effective.= All the efficient parts of an army that may be\r\nbrought into action are called effective, and generally consist of\r\nartillery, cavalry, and infantry, with their necessary appendages, such\r\nas hospital staff, wagon-train, etc. Effective forces of a country; all\r\nthe disposable strength, vigor, and activity of any armed proportion of\r\nnative or territorial population.

Here Edward, brother of\r\nRobert Bruce, after invading Ireland in 1315, was defeated by Sir John\r\nBermingham in 1318. Bruce was killed by Roger de Maupis, a burgess of\r\nDundalk.\r\n\r\n=Fouiller= (_Fr._). To search. In a military sense, it signifies to\r\ndetach small bodies of infantry round the flanks of a column that is\r\nmarching through a wood, for the purpose of discovering an ambuscade,\r\nand of giving timely notice that it may be avoided. The same precaution\r\nis necessary when a body of men advance towards or enter a village.\r\n\r\n=Fouling.= The action of gunpowder in dirtying the bore of a gun. Cannon\r\nfor this and other reasons are sponged after each round.\r\n\r\n=Foundation.= In military architecture, is that part of a building which\r\nis underground, or the mass of stone, brick, etc., which supports a\r\nbuilding, or upon which the walls of a superstructure are raised; or it\r\nis the coffer or bed dug below the level of the ground to raise a\r\nbuilding upon.\r\n\r\n=Founder.= A person who casts cannon, etc.\r\n\r\n=Foundery.= In military matters, the art of casting all kinds of\r\nordnance, such as cannon, mortars, etc.\r\n\r\n=Foundry.= A place for casting all kinds of ordnance; a foundery.\r\n\r\n=Four.= A place of confinement in Paris to which vagabonds and persons\r\nwho could not give any satisfactory account of themselves were\r\ncommitted; and when once shut up had their names registered, and were\r\nenlisted for the old French government.

In the decline of their power it was\r\nconquered by the Franks, a people of Germany, then inhabiting Franconia,\r\nwhere they became known about 240. These invaders gave the name to the\r\nkingdom (_Franken-ric_, Frank’s Kingdom); but the Gauls, being by far\r\nthe more numerous, are the real ancestors of the modern French. For\r\ndetails of important events in France, see separate articles.\r\n\r\n=Franches= (_Fr._). _Les compagnies franches_, free companies, were\r\nbodies of men detached and separated from the rest of the army, having\r\neach a chief, or commandant. They consisted chiefly of dragoons,\r\nhussars, etc., and their peculiar duty was to make irruptions into an\r\nenemy’s country. They may not improperly be called land-pirates, as\r\ntheir chief occupation was to harass and plunder the enemy and his\r\nadherents, in whatever manner they could, without paying any regard to\r\nmilitary forms. The persons who composed these corps were termed\r\npartisans. They always accompanied the main army in time of war, and\r\nwere distributed among the different garrison towns in France during\r\npeace. They were common to every power in Europe; the Pandours and\r\nHulans were of this description. They were the worst afflictions of war;\r\nand generally as fatal to their friends as to their enemies.\r\n\r\n=Francisque= (_Fr._). A battle-axe; an ancient weapon formed like an\r\naxe, used principally by the Franks.\r\n\r\n=Franco-Prussian War.= The origin of this dreadful series of sanguinary\r\nconflicts is ascribed to the jealousy of the emperor of the French of\r\nthe greatly increased power of Prussia, in consequence of the\r\nsuccessful issue of the war with Denmark in 1864, and more especially\r\nof that with Austria in 1866. By these events the German Confederation\r\nwas annulled, and the North German Confederation established under the\r\nsupremacy of the king of Prussia, whose territories were also enlarged\r\nby the annexation of Hanover, Hesse-Casel, Nassau, Frankfort, and other\r\nprovinces. This great augmentation of the power of Prussia was mainly\r\ndue to the policy of Count Bismarck-Schönhausen, prime minister. In\r\nMarch, 1857, a dispute arose through the emperor’s proposals for the\r\npurchase of Luxemburg of the king of Holland, which was strongly opposed\r\nby Prussia, but the affair was eventually settled, by a conference of\r\nthe representatives of the great powers declaring Luxemburg neutral.\r\nBoth governments, however, had prepared for the impending struggle, and\r\nthe crisis came when Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen\r\nconsented to become a candidate for the throne of Spain, about July 3,\r\n1870. This was violently denounced by the French government, and\r\neventually, after some negotiation and the intervention of Great\r\nBritain, the prince, with the consent of his sovereign, declined the\r\nproffered crown. This submission did not satisfy the French government\r\nand nation, and the demand for a guarantee against the repetition of\r\nsuch an acceptance irritated the Prussian government, and led to the\r\ntermination of the negotiations. War was declared by the emperor July\r\n15, 1870, and actually commenced about July 23. It did not end until\r\nJanuary 27, 1871, and France was overrun by the victorious Prussians and\r\ntheir auxiliaries. On May 10, 1871, a definitive treaty of peace was\r\nconcluded at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and on account of the rapid payment\r\nof the war expenses the last German soldier left French soil in July,\r\n1873.

On the 13th commenced a series of most desperate\r\nyet unsuccessful attacks on the Confederate works, defended by Gens.\r\nLee, Jackson, Longstreet, and others. Gen. Hooker crossed the river with\r\nreserves, and joined in the conflict in vain. The Federal army recrossed\r\nthe Rappahannock December 15 and 16. This battle was one of the severest\r\nof the war. Fredericksburg was the scene of several bloody battles\r\nduring the civil war.\r\n\r\n=Frederickshald.= A town of Norway, at the influx of the Tistedals-elf\r\ninto the Idefiord, 55 miles southeast from Christiania.

Thomas was elected doge in 1415; being\r\nattacked by Alfonso of Aragon and the Duke of Milan, he made a brave\r\nresistance, and was forced to retire from Genoa in 1421. Pietro was\r\nelected in 1450, and for eight years maintained his power against\r\nAlfonso of Aragon and the Adorni; he was killed in an attempt to expel\r\nthe French from Genoa in 1459. There were several other doges of this\r\nfamily in Genoa.\r\n\r\n=Fréjus.= A town of France, in the department of the Var, 45 miles\r\nnortheast from Toulon.

See RECOIL\r\nand ELSWICK COMPRESSOR.\r\n\r\n=Friction Primer.= In gunnery, consists of a short tube of metal\r\ninserted into a hole near the top of a larger tube, and soldered in that\r\nposition. The short tube is lined with a composition made by mixing\r\ntogether one part of chlorate of potassa and two of sulphuret of\r\nantimony, formed into a paste with gum-water. A serrated wire passes\r\nthrough the short tube and hole opposite to it in the side of the long\r\none, the open end of the short tube being compressed with nippers, and\r\nthe wire at the end of the serrated part doubled under to prevent\r\ndisplacement. The other end of the wire is doubled and twisted by\r\nmachinery. The long tube is filled with rifle-powder, its upper end\r\nbeing covered with shellac-varnish blackened with lamp-black, and its\r\nlower end closed with shoemaker’s wax and dipped into varnish. One great\r\nadvantage of the friction tube is that it gives an enemy at night no\r\nclue to the position of a piece as does the lighted port-fire or\r\nslow-match.\r\n\r\n=Friedland.= A town of East Prussia, in the circle of Königsberg, on the\r\nAlle.

This machine has been used since the invention of\r\ncannon. The fronde or sling was used by the Romans on three different\r\noccasions, viz.: when they sent their light-armed men, called _velites_,\r\nforward to skirmish before a general engagement; when they wished to\r\ndrive the enemy from under the walls of a town which they were preparing\r\nto storm, and finally to harass and wound the men in the enemy’s works.\r\nThis weapon, in fact, together with the bow and arrow, may be numbered\r\namong the primitive arms of mankind.\r\n\r\n=Fronde, Civil Wars of the.= These occurred in France in the minority of\r\nLouis XIV. (1648-53), during the government of the queen, Anne of\r\nAustria, and Cardinal Mazarin, between the followers of the court and\r\nthe nobility, and the Parliament and the citizens.

The _front of a work_ or fortification is the\r\nside it presents to the enemy. The _front of an army_, except in\r\nretreating, is the side towards the enemy. A column is said to be _right\r\nin front_ when it is formed by facing or wheeling to the right.\r\n\r\n=Front, Bastioned.= A curtain connecting two half bastions.\r\n\r\n=Front of Operations.= See STRATEGY.\r\n\r\n=Frontal.= A front piece; something worn on the forehead or face; or the\r\nmetal face-guard of a soldier.\r\n\r\n=Fronted.= Formed with a front; as, fronted brigades.\r\n\r\n=Frontier.= That part of a country which fronts or faces another\r\ncountry; the marches; the border, confines, or extreme part of a\r\ncountry, bordering on another country; hence, a fortified or guarded\r\nposition.

They were also, under the Roman empire, officers who acted as\r\nspies in the provinces, and reported to the emperor whatever seemed\r\nworthy of note. They appear to have derived this appellation from their\r\ngathering news in the same way that the Frumentarii or purveyors\r\ncollected corn.\r\n\r\n=Fuel.= The matter or aliment of fire; anything capable of ignition.\r\nThere is a certain allowance of fuel made by government to regiments and\r\ncompanies. Officers in the U. S. army, at the present time, buy their\r\nfuel; in other countries it is furnished.\r\n\r\n=Fuente-la-Higuera.= A city of Spain, in the province of Valencia.

It is used for percussion-caps,\r\nprimers, fuzes, etc. From its peculiar power to produce detonations it\r\nis the detonating agent for modern blasting powders, containing\r\nnitro-glycerine, also, for gun-cotton. _Detonating caps_, or\r\n_exploders_, are copper caps containing from 3 to 25 grains of the\r\nfulminate. In ordinary blasting, where the tube fuze is used, the cap is\r\nplaced on the end of the fuze and crimped around it. The cap is then\r\nburied a short distance in the blasting charge, or cartridge. See\r\nEXPLOSIVES.\r\n\r\n=Fumigation.= To correct and purify an infectious or confined\r\natmosphere, such as is often found in transports, fumigations are\r\nnecessary. The materials recommended for the purpose are brimstone with\r\nsaw-dust; or nitre with vitriolic acid; or common salt with the same\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n=Fund.= There are several kinds of funds in the U. S. service, viz.:\r\npost fund, which is constituted by the troops baking their own bread and\r\nthereby saving 33¹⁄₃ per cent., the difference between bread and flour;\r\nthe post trader also pays an assessment of 10 cents a month for every\r\nofficer and soldier in the garrison, which is carried to the credit of\r\nthe fund. This fund is used to defray expenses of the post bakery,\r\ngarden, school, library and reading-room, chapel, printing-press, etc.\r\nFifty per cent. of the post fund, after deducting expenses of the\r\nbakery, is set aside and transferred to the regimental treasurer; this\r\nconstitutes a regimental fund, which is appropriated exclusively for the\r\nmaintenance of a band, and, when a regiment does not have access to a\r\npost library, for the purchase of books and papers. The savings arising\r\nfrom an economical use of rations of the company (excepting the savings\r\nof flour) constitute the company fund, which is kept in the hands of the\r\ncompany commander, and disbursed by him _exclusively for the benefit of\r\nthe enlisted men of the company_, as follows: For enlisted men’s mess,\r\nfor garden seeds and utensils, for purchase of books, papers, etc., when\r\nthe company does not have access to a post library or reading-room, and\r\nfor such exercise and amusements as may be, in the judgment of the\r\ncommanding officer, for the benefit or comfort of the enlisted men of\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\n=Funeral Honors.= If an officer dies when on duty with his regiment, or\r\nengaged on staff employ, he is buried with military honors. His hat,\r\nepaulettes, and sword are placed upon the coffin, soldiers support it,\r\nand officers bear the pall; the troops march at a slow and solemn pace,\r\nwith arms reversed; the drums are muffled; the band plays the dead\r\nmarch; and after the body has been lowered into the grave, a party of\r\ninfantry, cavalry, or artillery, fire three volleys over it, and then\r\nretire. The strength of the funeral party, as it is called, depends upon\r\nthe rank of the deceased. Artillery officers are sometimes honored by\r\ndischarges of cannon. When a cavalry officer is buried his horse follows\r\nthe _cortege_. When the funeral of an officer entitled, when living, to\r\na salute, takes place at or near a military post, minute-guns are fired\r\nwhile the remains are being borne to the place of interment; but the\r\nnumber of such guns is not to exceed that which the officer was entitled\r\nto as a salute when living. After the remains are deposited in the\r\ngrave, a salute corresponding to the rank of the deceased officer will\r\nbe fired,--three salvos of artillery, or three volleys of musketry.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a flag-officer of the navy, whether of the United States\r\nor of a foreign country, dying afloat, and the remains are brought\r\nashore, minute-guns are fired from the ship while the body is being\r\nconveyed to the shore. If it be in the vicinity of a military post, the\r\nflag of the latter is displayed at half-staff, and minute-guns are fired\r\nfrom the post while the procession is moving from the landing-place.\r\nThese minute-guns are not to exceed in number that which the officer was\r\nentitled to, as a salute, when living. During the funeral of a civil\r\nfunctionary entitled, when living, to a salute, the flag is displayed at\r\nhalf-staff, and minute-guns fired as before; but neither salutes nor\r\nsalvos are fired after the remains are deposited in the grave. On the\r\ndeath of an officer at a military post, the flag is displayed at\r\nhalf-staff, and kept so, between the hours of reveille and retreat,\r\nuntil the last salvo or volley is fired over the grave, or if the\r\nremains are not interred at the post, until they are removed therefrom.\r\nFuneral honors are likewise accorded to enlisted men. During the funeral\r\nof an enlisted man, the flag is displayed at half-staff, and is hoisted\r\nto the top after the final volley or gun is fired. All military posts in\r\nsight, or within 6 miles of each other, display their flags at\r\nhalf-staff upon the occasion of either one doing so. The same rule is\r\nobserved toward a vessel-of-war.\r\n\r\nOn all occasions where the flag is displayed at half-staff, it is\r\n_lowered_ to that position from the top of the staff. It is afterwards\r\n_hoisted_ to the top _before_ being finally lowered.\r\n\r\n=Furl, To.= In regard to military colors, is opposed to their exposure;\r\nand is used to express the act of folding them so as to be cased.\r\n\r\n=Furlough.= The term is usually applied to the absence with leave of\r\nnon-commissioned officers and other enlisted men, and may be granted at\r\nthe discretion of the commanding officer.\r\n\r\n=Furlough.= To furnish with a furlough; to grant leave of absence.\r\n\r\n=Furnace.= In mining, signifies a hollow or excavation which is made in\r\nthe earth and is charged with gunpowder, for the purpose of blowing up a\r\nrock, wall, or any part of a fortification.\r\n\r\n=Furnish.= To provide; to equip; as, to furnish one with arms for\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\n=Furniture.= In a military sense, applies to certain articles which are\r\nallowed in barracks, to which are added household utensils, etc. Horse\r\nfurniture, are ornaments and embellishments which are adopted by\r\nmilitary men when they are mounted for service or parade, consisting\r\nchiefly of housings, saddle-cloth, etc.\r\n\r\n=Furruckabad.= A fortified town, and capital of a district of the same\r\nname, in the province of Agra, Hindustan, about a mile from the Ganges.\r\nLord Lake defeated Holkar at this place in 1804.\r\n\r\n=Fürth.= A town of Franconia, situated at the confluence of the Rezat\r\nand Pegnitz, 4 miles northwest from Nuremberg. In 1632 a battle was\r\nfought here between Gustavus Adolphus and Wallenstein, in which the\r\nlatter had the advantage.\r\n\r\n=Fuse.= See FUZE.\r\n\r\n=Fusil.= A light musket; a steel which strikes fire out of a flint; a\r\ntinder-box; the piece of steel which covers the pan of a fire-arm.\r\n\r\n=Fusil à Chevalets.= A species of fusils upon rests, which was\r\nrecommended by Marshal Vauban, to be used at the commencement of a\r\nsiege, about 50 or 100 toises in front of the glacis, at the entrances\r\nof narrow passages, etc.\r\n\r\n=Fusiliers.= In the British service, were formerly soldiers armed with a\r\nlighter fusil or musket than the rest of the army; but at present all\r\nregiments of foot carry the same rifle. Fusilier is therefore simply a\r\nhistorical title borne by a few regiments. The royal regiment of Scotch\r\nFusiliers was raised in 1678; the royal regiment of Welsh Fusiliers was\r\nraised in 1685, and another royal regiment of Welsh Fusiliers was raised\r\nin 1688-89. It is always presumed that these corps like the guards\r\npossess an _esprit de corps_, which is peculiar to themselves. The\r\nFusilier regiments never had any ensigns, their junior officers ranked\r\nas second lieutenants, taking precedence of all ensigns, and the 7th or\r\nRoyal Fusiliers have no second lieutenants, so that their junior\r\nofficers rank with the rest of the army according to the date of their\r\nseveral commissions, as lieutenants. Fusilier regiments wear a bear-skin\r\nhead-dress. Among the French when pikes were in use, each regiment had\r\nonly 4 fusiliers, exclusive of 10 grenadiers, who carried the fusil or\r\nmusket. Among the French there was a distinct regiment of fusiliers\r\nunder the immediate command of the master of the ordnance.\r\n\r\n=Fusillade.= A simultaneous discharge of fire-arms in a military\r\nexercise; as, a grand fusillade. To shoot down by a simultaneous\r\ndischarge of fire-arms. “Fusillade them all.”\r\n\r\n=Fusils à l’Eppe= (_Fr._). Fusils with long bayonets, shaped like a\r\ncut-and-thrust sword. These weapons were recommended as extremely useful\r\nin the rear rank of a battalion, or in detached bodies that are\r\nstationed for the defense of baggage, etc.\r\n\r\n=Fusils, Mousquets= (_Fr._). A sort of fusil which was invented by\r\nMarshal Vauban, and which was so contrived that in case the flint did\r\nnot strike fire, the powder might be inflamed by means of a small match\r\nwhich was fixed to the breech.\r\n\r\n=Fustuarium.= In Roman antiquity, a method of inflicting capital\r\npunishment upon any soldier guilty of theft, desertion, or similar\r\ncrimes. When the accused had been found guilty he was made to stand in\r\nfront of the legion to which he belonged. One of the tribunes then\r\ntouched him lightly with a stick, and all the soldiers immediately\r\nrushed upon the criminal and beat him to death with clubs (fustes). If\r\nhe escaped--as he was allowed to do if he could, but which was rarely if\r\never possible--he was forbidden ever to return to his native country,\r\nand his nearest relatives were not allowed to receive him into their\r\nhouses. This method of capital punishment continued to be enforced even\r\nunder the empire.\r\n\r\n=Futtehghur.= A town of Hindostan, British district of Furruckabad, on\r\nthe western bank of the Ganges. In the vicinity is the British military\r\ncantonment. Holkar, the Mahratta chief, appeared before the place in\r\n1804, and was preparing for the assault of the fort, when the arrival of\r\nthe British army under Lord Lake drove him into precipitate flight.\r\n\r\n=Fuyard= (_Fr._). A runaway; a coward. _Un corps fuyard_, a regiment\r\nthat has been in the habit of running away.\r\n\r\n=Fuze.= In gunnery, is a contrivance for igniting the bursting charge in\r\na hollow projectile at any point of its flight. The simplest\r\nclassification of fuzes is the _time fuze_, the _percussion fuze_, and\r\nthe _concussion fuze_, which are usually defined as follows:\r\n\r\nFUZE, CONCUSSION. Is a fuze that is operated by the shock of discharge,\r\nor the shock of impact, excluding direct percussion effects. It is\r\nespecially applicable to hollow spherical projectiles. The usual\r\ndifference between the concussion and percussion fuze is, that the\r\nformer explodes no matter what point of the projectile strikes, whereas\r\nthe latter requires the projectile to strike at or near the front end;\r\nbut these are exceptions to the rule.\r\n\r\nFUZE, PERCUSSION. As shown below, is a fuze that receives no flame from\r\nthe charge in the gun, but at the moment of impact a flame is generated\r\nby means of fulminates, which produces the explosion of the charge in\r\nthe shell. Most varieties of this fuze consist essentially of a brass or\r\npewter _fuze-plug_, or case which contains an iron or steel _plunger_\r\nterminating in a nipple which carries a common percussion-cap; the\r\n_plunger_ is held in its place at the lower end of the fuze-plug by a\r\ncollar-screw, wire, or other device; when the projectile strikes the\r\nplunger breaks loose, and by its inertia is driven forward with such\r\nforce as to explode the cap and ignite the charge. This form of fuze is\r\nused for rifle-shells.\r\n\r\nFUZE, TIME. This fuze is composed of a case of paper, wood, or metal,\r\ninclosing a column of burning composition ignited by the charge in the\r\ngun; it burns for a certain time, at the end of which the flame is\r\ncommunicated to the bursting charge of the projectile. This fuze is used\r\nfor both shells and case-shot.\r\n\r\n=Fuze, Blasting.= A fuze used to fire charges in mines and quarries. It\r\nconsists usually of a flexible tube filled with a slow-burning\r\ncomposition. The tube is made of various materials, and is usually\r\nwaterproof. In Beckford’s fuze the composition is encased in flax, which\r\nis covered with gutta-percha, and wound with varnished tape. This fuze\r\nis used extensively in England.\r\n\r\n=Fuze-Composition.= See LABORATORY STORES.\r\n\r\n=Fuze, Electric.= A fuze ignited by the passage of an electric current.\r\nIt is used for firing torpedoes, for the simultaneous discharge of guns\r\nand charges in mining. The principle used is the heating of the wire by\r\nthe current at a point of resistance. The point of resistance is called\r\nthe _bridge_. Being surrounded by a priming of powder or other\r\nexplosive, its sudden heating causes ignition in the fuze. The _bridge_\r\nis made in various ways,--by connecting the current wires by a fine\r\nplatinum wire; by passing the current through a chemical mixture\r\nrendered conducting by containing a salt of copper; also by filing the\r\nmain wire nearly in two, and rubbing the cut with a lead-pencil.\r\n\r\n=Fuze-implements.= Are the fuze-cutter, fuze-setter, fuze-mallet,\r\nfuze-saw, etc. See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Fuze, Safety.= A name given to a blasting fuze filled with\r\nquick-burning composition, but sufficiently long to be ignited at a safe\r\ndistance from the charge.\r\n\r\n=Fuze, Tape.= So called from its shape. May be quick or slow burning.\r\n\r\n=Fuzes, Combination.= Are fuzes combining the principles of the simple\r\nfuzes. The term is specially applied to _time-percussion_ fuzes, which\r\nare so arranged as to burst either at the end of a certain time or upon\r\nstriking the object. No very exact classification of fuzes has ever been\r\nmade. If we consider all the operations necessary to the action of the\r\nfuze, only certain time fuzes can be considered simple. Concussion fuzes\r\nusually depend for their action upon some operation which takes place\r\nbetween the discharge and the time of impact, which bestows a character\r\nof sensitiveness which would, if existing at the time of loading, make\r\nthem too dangerous to handle. Percussion fuzes, also, must have a\r\nsimilar supplementary operation, but this usually takes place at the\r\ntime of discharge, or upon impact. It is by this means that the\r\nsafety-pin, screw, or wire holding the plunger is removed or broken. For\r\nthese reasons these fuzes are ordinarily _time-concussion_ and\r\n_concussion-percussion_, respectively. A fuze, however, usually takes\r\nits name from the immediate cause of the explosion. If this is due to\r\nthe explosion of a fulminate by a direct blow, it is a percussion fuze.\r\nIf the shock acts in a different way, it is called concussion. If the\r\nexplosion takes place at the end of a given time, we have a time fuze.\r\nThere are also fuzes which may be called _centrifugal-percussion_,\r\n_concussion-chemical_, _concussion-friction_, etc., examples of which\r\nwill be given. It is readily seen that it is difficult to make a\r\nclassification which will cover all the ingenious devices which have\r\nbeen invented.\r\n\r\nThe simplest time fuze is one which is ignited by the flame of\r\ndischarge. In the U. S. field and siege service the paper fuze is used\r\nfor rifle projectiles, both shells and case-shot, and in the field\r\nservice the Bormann for spherical. For larger spherical projectiles, the\r\npaper case is inclosed in a hollow plug of wood, as in mortar-shells,\r\nand in a brass plug in the sea-coast service. In the latter the outer\r\nend of the plug is closed with a brass cap having a crooked chaume, to\r\nprevent the burning composition from being extinguished in striking\r\nwater. In the U. S. service percussion fuzes are used only for\r\nrifle-shells. The fuze ordinarily employed is, strictly speaking, a\r\n_concussion-percussion_, since the safety wire must be ruptured by the\r\nshock of impact before the cap can be exploded.\r\n\r\nThe time fuze already described can be used in smooth-bore guns and in\r\nmuzzle-loading rifles; but in breech-loading guns or guns without\r\nwindage, the fuze composition cannot be ignited directly by the flame of\r\ndischarge,--one of the strongest arguments in favor of muzzle-loaders.\r\nThe time fuze for breech-loading guns is ignited by an interior\r\ncontrivance, usually a plunger and cap; it is, consequently, a\r\n_percussion-time_ fuze. Such is the nature of the _Armstrong time fuze_\r\nand the time fuzes used in Germany and Russia. Time fuzes are absolutely\r\nnecessary to the successful use of case-shot or shrapnel, which must be\r\nburst in the air. The latest invention in time fuzes is the substitution\r\nof clock-work for the column of burning composition as a time-keeper,--a\r\nYankee idea which has not yet received any official recognition, or been\r\nsubjected to public test.\r\n\r\nThe Boxer fuze, used extensively in England, is a time fuze consisting\r\nof a column of composition driven in a wooden plug, which is closed at\r\nthe lower end. In some forms of the fuze small longitudinal channels\r\nfilled with rifle-powder communicate with the bursting charge. The\r\ntime-scale is a row of holes in the side of the plug, one of which is\r\nbored through to the composition in setting the fuze. The flame\r\ncommunicates with the charge either through the side hole directly, or\r\nby the side channels downwards through the end of the plug. Two kinds of\r\nfuzes are used,--the _simple time fuze_ for muzzle-loaders, and the\r\n_percussion-time_ for breech-loaders.\r\n\r\nThe Splingard fuze, invented by Captain Splingard, of the Belgian\r\nservice, is a good example of a _time-concussion_ fuze. It consists of\r\na column of pure composition surrounding a hollow spindle of plaster of\r\nParis. The composition is ignited by the flame of discharge, and burns\r\naway, leaving the spindle unsupported. When the projectile strikes, the\r\npart of the spindle above the unburned composition breaks off, and the\r\nflame fires the bursting charge through the hole in the stump. If the\r\nspindle fails to break, the charge is fired when the entire column has\r\nbeen consumed. This fuze is specially applicable to spherical\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\nThe concussion fuze formerly used in Prussia was a\r\n_time-concussion-chemical_ fuze. The burning of a column of composition\r\nleft a glass tube containing sulphuric acid to be broken, by a lead\r\nball, by the shock of impact. The acid coming in contact with a mixture\r\nof chlorate potash, sulphur, and white sugar, produced a flame which\r\nfired the bursting charge.\r\n\r\nThe _Beebe concussion fuze_ for spherical projectiles, invented by\r\nCaptain Beebe, U. S. Ordnance Corps, was a _concussion-friction_ fuze. A\r\ncontrivance equivalent to a friction-primer buried in the\r\nbursting-charge, and offering great resistance to motion in the powder,\r\nwas fired by the sudden movement of an attached weight upon impact. The\r\nshock of discharge also played a part in detaching the fuze from the\r\nfuze-plug.\r\n\r\nThe _German percussion fuze_, now commonly used in Krupp guns, may be\r\ncalled _centrifugal-percussion_. The safety-pin passes through a hole\r\nfrom the outside of the shell. This pin is thrown out by the rotation of\r\nthe shot, leaving but slight resistances to the motion of the plunger.\r\n\r\nIn the English _cap-percussion fuze_ the corresponding safety-pin is\r\npulled out by a tape by hand just before loading.\r\n\r\nThe _Pettman general service fuze_, used in England, is a _percussion_\r\nfuze of unusual form, equally applicable to spherical or oblong\r\nprojectiles. It consists, essentially, of a hollow screw-plug containing\r\na ball covered with detonating composition, which is freed from its\r\nbearings by the shock of discharge, and explodes the shell upon impact\r\nby striking the walls surrounding it. The detonating ball sometimes\r\nfails in breech-loading guns, the motion of the projectiles being too\r\nsteady to shake it out of its seat. For this reason a _plain_ ball, as\r\nit is called, is placed in the upper part of the fuze, and held between\r\ntwo disks. These separate upon discharge, and the ball is thrown\r\noutwards by the rotation opposite an annular groove in the lower plug or\r\ndisk filled with fulminate, which is exploded upon impact, the lower\r\nplug being driven against the ball by its inertia. This fuze is,\r\nproperly, a _concussion-percussion_ fuze.\r\n\r\n=Fyroz=, or =Feroze= (written also _Ferose_, _Firoz_, _Firouz_,\r\n_Feyrouz_, and _Firuz_). A Persian word signifying “victorious,” and\r\nforming the name of several ruling kings in Persia and Hindostan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gabion.= A kind of basket made of osier twigs, of a cylindrical form,\r\nhaving different dimensions, according to the purpose for which it is\r\nused. Filled with earth, these gabions serve in sieges to carry on the\r\napproaches under cover, when the assailants come near the fortification.\r\nBatteries are often made of gabions, which likewise serve for revetments\r\nin constructing parapets of loose earth.\r\n\r\n=Gabionage.= Gabions when used for fortification.\r\n\r\n=Gabionnade.= A work hastily thrown up; especially, one formed chiefly\r\nof gabions. A _parapet en gabionnade_ is a parapet constructed of\r\ngabions.\r\n\r\n=Gabions, Corrugated Iron.= Are gabions made of corrugated iron. For\r\nthis purpose, the corrugated sheet should be 6 feet long, 33 inches\r\nwide, and of iron weighing three-quarters of a pound to the square foot.\r\n\r\nThe corrugations running transversely, the sheet is easily bent into a\r\ncylindrical form, in which it is retained by two clamps, the holes for\r\nwhich are punched near the corners of the sheet. The chief advantage\r\nclaimed for the corrugated over the hoop gabion is, the readiness with\r\nwhich it can be put together in the field. It is also rather more\r\nportable, and stakes are dispensed with; but it is inferior to the hoop\r\ngabion in stiffness.\r\n\r\n=Gad.= The point of a spear, or an arrowhead; a steel spike on the\r\nknuckle of a gauntlet.\r\n\r\n=Gadaru= (_Fr._). A very broad Turkish sabre.\r\n\r\n=Gadling.= A spike or sharp-pointed boss on the knuckle of a gauntlet; a\r\ngad.\r\n\r\n=Gaeta.= A strongly fortified maritime town of the Neapolitan province\r\nof Terra di Lavoro, 40 miles northwest from Naples. It is one of the\r\nstrongest places in the kingdom, and its harbor is the same as it was in\r\nthe time of the Romans. In 1799 and in 1806 it was taken by the French,\r\nand in 1849 Pope Pius IX. sought an asylum here. When Garibaldi took\r\npossession of Naples for Victor Emmanuel in September, 1860, Francis\r\nII., the last Bourbon king of Naples, took refuge in Gaeta, and remained\r\nuntil the town was taken by Gen. Cialdini, in February, 1861, after a\r\nsiege of several weeks’ duration.\r\n\r\n=Gætulia.= An ancient country of Africa, situated south of Mauritania\r\nand Numidia, and embracing the western part of the desert of Sahara. Its\r\ninhabitants belonged to the great aboriginal Berber family of North and\r\nNorthwestern Africa. They were a savage and warlike race, and their\r\nfirst collision with the Romans was during the Jugurthine war, when they\r\nserved as light horse in the army of the Numidian king. Cornelius Cossus\r\nLentulus led a force against them, and for his success obtained a\r\ntriumph and the surname of _Gætulicus_. The ancient Gætulians are\r\nbelieved to be represented in modern times by the Tuaricks.\r\n\r\n=Gaffles.= The steel lever with which the ancients bent their\r\ncross-bows.\r\n\r\n=Gage.= A challenge to combat; that is, a gauntlet, glove, cap, or the\r\nlike, cast on the ground by the challenger, and taken up by the acceptor\r\nof the challenge.\r\n\r\n=Gages= (_Fr._). Wages. Among the French this term signified the fruits\r\nor compensations which were derived by individuals from appointments\r\ngiven by the crown, whether of a military, civil, or judicial nature, or\r\nfor service done at sea or by land.\r\n\r\n=Gain.= To conquer; to get the better; as, we gained the day, etc. To\r\n_gain ground_, implies to take up the ground which a retiring enemy\r\nvacates.\r\n\r\n=Gaine de Flamme= (_Fr._). A sort of linen sheath or cover, into which\r\nthe staff of a flag or pendant is put.\r\n\r\n=Gaine de Pavillon= (_Fr._). A cloth or linen band, which is sewed\r\nacross the flag, and through which the different ribbons are interlaced.\r\n\r\n=Gaines’s Mill.= In Hanover Co., Va., about 20 miles northeast of\r\nRichmond. Here, on June 27, 1862, was fought one of the “seven days’\r\ncontests” between the Confederate forces under Gen. Lee and the Federals\r\nunder Gen. McClellan, in which the latter were victorious.\r\n\r\n=Gain-pain.= Bread-gainer; a term applied in the Middle Ages to the\r\nsword of a hired soldier.\r\n\r\n=Gaiters.= A sort of cover for the leg, usually made of cloth, and are\r\neither long, as reaching to the knee, or short, as only reaching just\r\nabove the ankle; the latter are termed half-gaiters, and are worn by\r\ninfantry soldiers in Europe.\r\n\r\n=Galatia.= An ancient province of Asia Minor; in the 3d century B.C.,\r\nthe Gauls under Brennus invaded Greece, crossed the Hellespont, and\r\nconquered Troas, 278; were checked by Attalus in a battle about 239; and\r\nthen settled in what was called afterwards Gallogræcia and Galatia. The\r\ncountry was ravaged by Cn. Manlius, 189 B.C., and was finally annexed to\r\nthe Roman empire, 25 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Galatone.= A very ancient town in the south of Italy, in the province\r\nof Otranto, about 9 miles northeast of Gallipoli. In the struggle\r\nbetween Joanna, queen of Naples, and Alfonso, Galatone having declared\r\nfor the former, was besieged by Alfonso, and its ramparts destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Galea.= Among the Romans, a light casque, head-piece, or morion, coming\r\ndown to the shoulders, and commonly of brass; though Camillus, according\r\nto Plutarch, ordered those of his army to be of iron, as being the\r\nstronger metal.\r\n\r\n=Galeated.= Covered, as with a helmet.\r\n\r\n=Galet= (_Fr._). A round stone thrown from a sling or bow.\r\n\r\n=Galicia.= A province of Northwest Spain, was conquered by D. Junius\r\nBrutus, 136 B.C., and by the Vandals, 419, and was subdued by successive\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\n=Galicia.= A kingdom or province of the Austrian empire, which formerly\r\nconstituted a part of Poland. East Galicia was acquired by the emperor\r\nof Germany at the partition in 1772; and West Galicia at that of 1795.\r\nThe latter was ceded to the grand duchy of Warsaw in 1809; but recovered\r\nby Austria in 1815.\r\n\r\n=Gall.= To injure; to harass; to annoy; as, the troops were galled by\r\nthe shot of an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Gallant.= Noble in bearing or spirit; brave; high-spirited; courageous;\r\nheroic; magnanimous; as, a gallant youth; a gallant officer.\r\n\r\n=Gallantly.= In a gallant manner, spirit or bearing; nobly; bravely; as,\r\nto fight gallantly; to defend a place gallantly.\r\n\r\n=Gallantry.= Bravery; courageousness; heroism; intrepidity; as, the\r\ntroops attacked the fort with great gallantry.\r\n\r\n=Gallas.= A warlike race occupying the south and east of Abyssinia. They\r\nfirst appear in history in the 16th century, when they extended their\r\nconquests from the interior of Africa, laying waste by constant\r\nincursions the countries of Eastern Africa to the mountains of\r\nAbyssinia. Politically they do not form a single nation, but are divided\r\ninto numerous tribes, forming separate kingdoms and states, which are\r\nfrequently at war with each other.\r\n\r\n=Gallery.= An underground passage, whether cut in the soil or built in\r\nmasonry; it forms the communication between the inner and exterior works\r\nof a fortified place. When prepared for defense, it is a defensive\r\ngallery. In military mines, galleries are the underground passages\r\nleading to and connecting the mine chambers. _Scarp and counterscarp\r\ngalleries_ are covered passages built in the scarp and counterscarp to\r\ngive a flanking fire in the ditch.\r\n\r\n=Gallery Descent of a Ditch.= Is the term applied when the besiegers\r\ncross the ditch by an underground passage.\r\n\r\n=Gallet= (_Fr._). See JALET.\r\n\r\n=Galling Fire.= A sustained discharge of cannon or small-arms, which by\r\nits execution greatly annoys the enemy.\r\n\r\n=Gallipoli.= An important town and seaport of Turkey in Europe, in the\r\nprovince of Rumili, is situated on the peninsula of the same name at the\r\nnortheast extremity of the Dardanelles, and about 130 miles\r\nwest-southwest of Constantinople. It was once fortified, but its only\r\ndefense now is a sorry square castle with an old tower. In 1357 the town\r\nwas taken by the Turks, and formed the earliest Turkish possessions in\r\nEurope. In 1854 the allied armies of England and France occupied it.\r\n\r\n=Gallipoli.= An important commercial seaport of Italy, in the Neapolitan\r\nprovince of Terra di Otranto. It has a good harbor, and in time of war\r\nis an important position, being strongly protected by fortifications and\r\na castle. In 450 the town was sacked by the Vandals; in 1284 it was\r\ndestroyed and almost depopulated by Charles of Anjou; and during\r\nsubsequent centuries suffered severely from the Venetians, French,\r\nSpaniards, and Turks. In 1809 it repulsed an attack from the English\r\nflotilla.\r\n\r\n=Gallop.= A mode of running by a quadruped, particularly by a horse, by\r\nlifting alternately the fore feet and the hind feet together, in\r\nsuccessive leaps or bounds. A word of command in the cavalry service.\r\n\r\n=Galloper.= A carriage on which very small guns are conveyed, having\r\nshafts on which the gun may be conveyed without a limber. This carriage\r\nis no longer used.\r\n\r\n=Gallowglass.= In ancient times, a heavy-armed foot-soldier of Ireland\r\nand the Western Isles.\r\n\r\n=Galway.= A seaport town of Ireland, and capital of Galway County.

Mention is\r\nmade of the _gardes de la porte_ in the oldest archives or records\r\nbelonging to the king’s household, in which service they were employed,\r\nwithout being responsible to any particular treasurer as other companies\r\nwere.

The\r\nfirst took an oath of fidelity to the king in person, and received the\r\nbâton from his hands. The duty he did was purely discretionary, and\r\ndepended on his own will. The lieutenants served by detachment, and took\r\ntheir tour of duty every quarter. Their specific service consisted in\r\nguarding the principal gate belonging to the king’s apartments.

It was instituted by Edward III. of\r\nEngland, and dates from about the year 1350, though some writers say\r\n1344. Its origin is variously related. In Rastel’s “Chronicles” it is\r\nstated that this order was devised by Richard I. at the siege of Acre,\r\nwhen he is said to have caused 26 knights to wear thongs of blue leather\r\nabout their legs. But the common account is, that the Countess of\r\nSalisbury happened at a ball to drop her garter, and that the king took\r\nit up and presented it to her, at the same time exclaiming, _Honi soit\r\nqui mal y pense_,--“Evil be to him who evil thinks,” in reference to the\r\nsmiles which he observed the action had excited among some of the\r\nbystanders; adding “that shortly they should see that garter advanced to\r\nso high an honor and renown, as to account themselves happy to wear it.”\r\nIt is founded in honor of the Holy Trinity, the Virgin Mary, St. Edward\r\nthe Confessor, and St. George; but the last, who had become the tutelary\r\nsaint of England, was considered its special patron; and for this reason\r\nit has always borne the title of “The Order of St. George,” as well as\r\nof “The Garter,” and those who wore it were called “Knights of St.\r\nGeorge.” The number of knights companions was originally 26, including\r\nthe sovereign, who is chief of the order; but in 1786 a statute was\r\npassed to the effect that this number should be irrespective of princes\r\nof the royal family, and illustrious foreigners on whom the honor might\r\nbe conferred. The well-known emblem of the order is a dark-blue ribbon\r\nedged with gold, bearing the motto _Honi soit qui mal y pense_ in golden\r\nletters, with a buckle and pendant of gold richly chased, and is worn on\r\nthe left leg below the knee. The mantle is of blue velvet, and on the\r\nleft breast a star is embroidered. The hood and surcoat are of crimson\r\nvelvet, and lined with white taffeta. The hat is of black velvet, with a\r\nplume of white ostrich feathers, in the centre of which there is a tuft\r\nof black herons’ feathers, all fastened to the hat by a band of\r\ndiamonds. The collar is of gold, and consists of 26 pieces, each in the\r\nform of a garter. The “George” is the figure of St. George on horseback\r\nencountering the dragon; it is worn to the collar, and there is a lesser\r\n“George” pendent to a broad, dark-blue ribbon over the left shoulder.\r\n\r\n=Garter King-of-Arms.= Is the principal king-of-arms in England. Though\r\nheld by the same person, they are distinct offices. The first was\r\ninstituted for the service of the order of the Garter (which see), not\r\non its first foundation, but afterwards by Henry V. as sovereign, with\r\nthe advice and consent of the knights-companions. The peculiar duty of\r\nGarter king-of-arms is to attend upon the knights at their solemnities,\r\nto intimate their election to those who are chosen by the order, to call\r\nthem to be installed at Windsor, to cause their arms to be hung up over\r\ntheir stalls, and to marshal their funeral processions, and those of\r\nroyal personages, and of members of higher nobility. In the capacity of\r\nprincipal king-of-arms, he grants and confirms arms, under the authority\r\nof the earl marshal, to whom he is not subject as Garter king-of-arms.\r\nAll new grants or patents of arms in England are first signed and sealed\r\nby him, and then by the king (of arms) of the province to which the\r\napplicant belongs.\r\n\r\n=Gas-check.= The device used in breech-loading cannon to prevent the gas\r\nfrom escaping at the breech.

They now passed under the sovereignty of the dukes of\r\nAquitania, who for a time were independent of the crown, but were\r\nafterwards conquered by King Pepin, and later by Charlemagne.\r\nSubsequently it became incorporated with Aquitania, and for a time\r\nbecame part of the English possessions, but was afterwards reconquered\r\nby the French.\r\n\r\n=Gastein=, =Badgastein=, or =Wilbad-Gastein=.

Commissary of stores; a sort of chief\r\ncommissary or superintendent-general of stores, whose functions were to\r\nprovide ammunition, bread, and biscuit, for the army.\r\n\r\n=Generalissimo.= The chief officer in command of an army. This word is\r\nused in most foreign languages. It was first used to designate the\r\nabsolute authority of Cardinal Richelieu, when he went to command the\r\nFrench army in Italy.\r\n\r\n=General, Lieutenant-.= The second rank among general officers, and next\r\nbelow that of general. The normal command of a lieutenant-general is\r\nthat of a division, but he is sometimes intrusted with the command of an\r\nentire army.\r\n\r\n=General, Major-.= The rank next below that of lieutenant-general, and\r\nabove brigadier-general. He usually commands a division; a general of\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n=General Officers.= Are all officers whose authority extends beyond the\r\nimmediate command of a regiment, and who have either separate districts\r\nor departments at home, or commands on foreign service. A brigade is the\r\nsmallest body of men constituting the command of a general officer. In\r\nan army of very large proportions, the normal sequence of command would\r\nbe the following: The general commanding-in-chief, generalissimo,\r\ncaptain-general, or field-marshal would command the whole force; the\r\ngenerals would have separate _corps d’armée_; the lieutenant-generals,\r\nwings of those _corps d’armée_; the major-generals, divisions in the\r\nwings; and brigadier-generals, brigades in the divisions. In practice,\r\nhowever, an army is rarely large enough to allow of this exact scheme of\r\nmilitary hierarchy being carried out; and general officers are also\r\nfrequently assigned to high commands without regard to seniority. In the\r\nU. S. service there are one general, one lieutenant-general (whose\r\noffices expire with the present incumbents), three major-generals, and\r\nsix brigadier-generals. The President is _ex officio_ commander-in-chief\r\nof the army. In the English service the sovereign is captain-general,\r\nand under the sovereign is the commander-in-chief, who takes rank as\r\nfield-marshal. In the staff corps the word general is also used, as\r\nsurgeon-, quartermaster-, adjutant-general, etc., to denote that the\r\nholder of the office has charge of his special department, and does not\r\nnecessarily imply that he is a general officer. The chiefs of staff\r\ndepartments, however, in the U. S. service are usually of the rank of\r\nbrigadier-general. In the German armies, and among the sovereigns of the\r\nNorth, there are certain generals of cavalry, and others of infantry,\r\nwho take rank of all lieutenant-generals. In these armies it is usual\r\nfor generals, lieutenant-generals, and major-generals to take their\r\nroutine of duty, and rise progressively in the infantry or cavalry corps\r\nto which they were originally appointed, until they arrived at a chief\r\ncommand: whereas in France and other countries a major-general might be\r\nemployed to take charge of either infantry or cavalry, without any\r\nregard being paid to the particular line of service in which he was\r\nbred.\r\n\r\n=General Orders.= See ORDERS.\r\n\r\n=General’s Guard.= See GARDE.\r\n\r\n=Generalship.= The office of general; the exercise of the functions of a\r\ngeneral; the skill and conduct of a general officer; military skill in a\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\n=Geneva.= A walled town of Switzerland, and the capital of a small\r\ncanton, at the western extremity of the lake of the same name. In 1784\r\nand 1794 revolutions took place in the city and state of Geneva; in 1798\r\nit was taken by the French, and, till 1813, it was the capital of the\r\ndepartment Leman, in the French empire, under Napoleon I. In 1814 it\r\njoined the Helvetic Confederation.\r\n\r\n=Geneva, Convention of.= In October, 1863, an international convention\r\nwas held at Geneva, Switzerland, comprising 14 governments, including\r\nGreat Britain, France, Austria, Russia, Prussia and Italy, who were\r\nrepresented by delegates, and propositions were drawn up forming the\r\n“Red Cross Society,” for the succor of the wounded in time of warfare.\r\nIt gave aid to the sick and wounded during the Franco-German war, and\r\nits flag is recognized by all powers as neutral.\r\n\r\n=Genius.= In a military sense, natural talent or disposition to every\r\nkind of warlike employment, more than any other; or, the aptitude a man\r\nhas received from nature to perform well and easily that which others\r\ncan do but indifferently and with a great deal of pains.\r\n\r\n=Genoa.= A fortified maritime city in Northwestern Italy, once a\r\ncelebrated republic, now the capital of a province of Northwestern\r\nItaly. From the 11th to the 18th century Genoa was the capital of a\r\nflourishing republic; it was bombarded by the French in 1684, and\r\nsubmitted to the Austrians in 1746; but, in consequence of a citizen\r\nhaving been abused by an Austrian officer, the inhabitants rose and\r\nmassacred most of the soldiery, and drove away the remainder. The\r\nrepublic in 1798 assumed the French form of government, with the title\r\nof Ligurian republic, and in 1805 it was annexed to the French empire.\r\nIn 1815 it was ceded to the king of Sardinia, and in 1859 the French\r\ntroops landed here on their route to oppose the Austrian army, which had\r\ninvaded Sardinia.\r\n\r\n=Genouillère.= That part of the parapet of a battery which remains above\r\nthe platform and under the gun, after the opening of the embrasure has\r\nbeen made. The name is derived from the French _genou_, the knee. The\r\nheight of the genouillère is regulated by that of the gun-carriage,\r\ngenerally from 2 to 3 feet.\r\n\r\n=Gens.= In Roman antiquity, a clan, embracing several families, whose\r\nbond of alliance was a common name and certain religious rites\r\nperformed in common. Persons of the same gens were called _gentiles_,\r\nwhile those of the same family were designated _agnati_.\r\n\r\n=Gens= (_Fr._). A word in much desultory use among the French,\r\nsignifying, in the general acceptation of it, people, servants,\r\nsoldiers, etc. This word is likewise used to distinguish bodies of men\r\nthat are in opposition to each other.\r\n\r\n=Gens d’Armes.= See GENDARMES.\r\n\r\n=Gentilhommes de la Garde= (_Fr._). Gentlemen of the guard. Commonly\r\ncalled _Au bec de corbin_, or the battle-axe, from the weapon which they\r\ncarried. This company went through many alterations during the monarchy\r\nof France. During the last years of that government it consisted of 200\r\nguards, under the command of a captain, a lieutenant, and an ensign. The\r\ncaptain had the power of giving away the subaltern commissions, and had,\r\nmoreover, the entire management of the rest; every vacancy being in his\r\ngift. They marched in file, each holding his battle-axe, before the king\r\non days of public ceremony. When the company was first raised, its\r\nparticular duty was to attend the king’s person, and to be constantly\r\nnear him on the day of battle.\r\n\r\n=Gentlemen-at-arms= (formerly called the _Gentlemen-Pensioners_). The\r\nbody-guard of the British sovereign, and, with the exception of the\r\nyeomen of the guard, the oldest corps in the British service. It was\r\ninstituted in 1509 by Henry VIII., and now consists of 1 captain, 1\r\nlieutenant, 1 standard-bearer, 1 clerk of the cheque, and 40 gentlemen,\r\nwho must all be retired military officers of service and distinction.\r\nThe attendance of gentlemen-at-arms is now rarely required, except on\r\nthe occasion of coronations and important state ceremonies.\r\n\r\n=Geographical Department, Commander of.= Is assimilated to the commander\r\nof a separate army, with the same powers and duties in similar cases\r\nover all the troops within the limits of the department. In all\r\ncountries he derives his authority to command from the highest power of\r\nthe government. In the United States he is assigned by order of the\r\nPresident, who alone can relieve him, and who also fixes the limits or\r\nboundaries of the department. His duties are mainly derived from customs\r\nof service. The only duties defined by statute relate to general\r\ncourts-martial, which he can convene, and his action is final on all\r\ncases tried by such courts, except in the case of a general officer, or\r\nwhere the sentence of the court extends to the loss of life or the\r\ndismissal of a commissioned officer. In time of war he is authorized by\r\nexisting laws to execute the death penalty in cases of persons convicted\r\nas spies, mutineers, deserters, or murderers, and in cases of guerrilla\r\nmarauders convicted in time of war of robbery, burglary, arson, rape,\r\nassault with intent to commit rape, or violation of the laws of war. See\r\nDEPARTMENT, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Geographical Division, Military.= In the United States a geographical\r\nmilitary division consists of a number of geographical military\r\ndepartments, usually under the command of a general officer.\r\n\r\n=Geometry.= That branch of mathematics which investigates the relations,\r\nproperties and measurements of solids, surfaces, lines, and angles; the\r\nscience which treats of the properties and relations of magnitudes. Its\r\nusefulness extends to almost every art and science. It is by the\r\nassistance of geometry that engineers conduct all their works, take the\r\nsituation and plans of towers, the distances of places, and the measure\r\nof such things as are only accessible to the sight. It is not only an\r\nintroduction to fortification, but highly necessary to mechanics. On\r\ngeometry, likewise, depends the theory of gunnery, mining, mechanics,\r\nhydraulics, pneumatics, etc.\r\n\r\n=George, Lake.= A beautiful sheet of water in the State of New York. Its\r\nlength is 36 miles; its breadth from 1 to 3 miles. Lake George was the\r\nscene of important military operations during the French and Indian war\r\nof 1755-59. Here stood Fort George, Fort William Henry, and other works.\r\n\r\n=George, St.= Patron of England and Russia, is reputed to have been born\r\nin Palestine in the 3d century. According to the legend, he became a\r\nprince in Cappadocia, and was distinguished for his exploit of rescuing\r\na king’s daughter from a dragon. He was a Christian, and suffered\r\nmartyrdom at Nicomedia, April 23, 303, for having torn down the edict of\r\nDiocletian against Christians, the emperor himself being then in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n=George, St., Banner of.= Is white with red cross. According to Sir N.\r\nH. Nicolas, the cross of St. George was worn as a badge over the armor\r\nof every English soldier “in the 14th and subsequent centuries, even if\r\nthe custom did not prevail at a much earlier period,” to indicate that\r\nhe was in the service of the crown. On the invasion of Scotland by\r\nRichard II. in 1386, it was ordained that every man of the English party\r\nshould wear a sign of the arms of St. George both before and behind. A\r\nsimilar ordinance was adopted by Henry V. for the government of his army\r\nin France. The cross of St. George forms a part of the British standard.\r\n\r\n=George, St., Knights of.= See GARTER, ORDER OF THE.\r\n\r\n=George, The.= The badge of the order of the Garter exhibiting the\r\nfigure of St. George on horseback piercing the falling dragon, which\r\nlies on a mount. See GARTER.\r\n\r\n=Georges Conspiracy.= Took place in France; Gens. Moreau and Pichegru,\r\nand Georges Cadoudal, who was commonly known by the name of Georges, and\r\nothers were arrested at Paris, charged with a conspiracy against the\r\nlife of Bonaparte, and for the restoration of Louis XVIII., February,\r\n1804. Pichegru was found strangled in prison, April 6, and 12 of the\r\nconspirators, including Georges, were executed, and others imprisoned,\r\nJune 22. Moreau was exiled and went to America; in 1813 he was killed\r\nbefore Dresden.\r\n\r\n=Georgia.= Called by the Russians Grusia, a considerable country of\r\nAsia, situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian, to the north of\r\nArmenia, and forming a government of Russia. The Georgians are skilled\r\nin the bow, and are thought to be the best soldiers in Asia. Georgia was\r\nformerly one kingdom, the inhabitants of which were Christians; but, in\r\n1639, when it was conquered by the Persians, the country was divided\r\nbetween two native princes, by themselves called kings, but by the\r\nSophia styled governors. Each of these had a guard of Mohammedan horse\r\nin their pay. In 1802 it was annexed to Russia.\r\n\r\n=Georgia.= One of the original States of the United States, bounded on\r\nthe north by Tennessee and North Carolina, on the east by South Carolina\r\nand the Atlantic Ocean, south by Florida, and west by Florida and\r\nAlabama. It was named in honor of King George II., who granted a charter\r\nfor establishing a colony there in 1732; but a permanent settlement was\r\nnot made till the following year, when Oglethorpe established himself at\r\nwhat is now Savannah. The colony soon became involved in several\r\ncontests with the Spaniards of Florida, who claimed the territory. In\r\n1739 Oglethorpe invaded Florida, but without much success. In 1742 the\r\nSpaniards retaliated by invading Georgia; but they also effected\r\nnothing. The next noteworthy event in the history of the colony was a\r\nwar with the Cherokees in 1761, which was terminated by their suing for\r\npeace, after their country had been laid waste. They were afterwards\r\npeaceable, and were removed to the Indian Territory in 1838. In the war\r\nof the Revolution Georgia warmly sided with the colonies, and, in\r\nconsequence, suffered severely at the hands of the British, who overran\r\nthe country, and captured Savannah, December 29, 1778. In the following\r\nyear (October, 1779) the Americans and French attempted to retake it,\r\nbut were repulsed with severe loss. In the civil war (1861-65), Georgia\r\ntook an active part against the Union, and suffered severely in\r\nconsequence. Atlanta was captured September 2, 1864, after which Gen.\r\nSherman marched with his army through the State to the sea over an area\r\nextending from 20 to 60 miles in width, destroying railroad\r\ncommunication, etc., and ending with the capture of Savannah, December\r\n20, 1864. This magnificent military movement effectually humbled the\r\nState, and in 1866 the President issued a proclamation declaring it no\r\nlonger in a state of insurrection.\r\n\r\n=Gerasa=, or =Jerash=. An ancient city of Syria, whose site is now\r\nmarked by very extensive and magnificent ruins, situated about 35 miles\r\neast of the Jordan, at the eastern extremity of the land of Bashan, and\r\non the borders of the great desert of Hauran. But little of its early\r\nhistory is known. In the time of the Antonines it had arrived at the\r\nheight of its splendor and prosperity. It was taken by Alexander Jannæus\r\nin 85 B.C.; the Jews burned it at the commencement of their last war\r\nwith the Romans; it was taken and plundered by Annius, the general of\r\nVespasian, and in 1122 its castle was destroyed by Baldwin II. of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n=Gerbe.= An ornamental firework. See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Gerberoi.= In Normandy, north of France. Here William the Conqueror was\r\nwounded in battle by his son Robert, who had joined the French king,\r\nPhilip I., 1078.\r\n\r\n=Gerit= (_Fr._). A Turkish dart 2¹⁄₂ feet long.\r\n\r\n=Germany= (Lat. _Germania_). The name given to a large portion of\r\nCentral Europe, composed of a number of independent states united\r\ntogether, and forming the German empire. In the time of Julius Cæsar the\r\nGermans were the most formidable and warlike of all the European\r\nbarbarians. They long withstood the attempts of the Romans to subdue\r\nthem; and, although that people conquered some parts of the country,\r\nthey were expelled before the close of the 3d century. In the 5th\r\ncentury the Huns and other tribes prevailed over the greater portion of\r\nGermany. In the latter part of the 8th century Charlemagne subdued the\r\nSaxons and other tribes, and was crowned emperor at Rome, December 25,\r\n800. At the extinction of his family the empire became elective, 911,\r\nand was generally obtained by a member of the house of Hapsburg from\r\n1437 to 1806, when the emperor Francis Joseph II. formally renounced the\r\ntitle of emperor of Germany, having assumed that of emperor of Austria\r\ntwo years previously. The Confederation of the Rhine was formed July 12,\r\n1806; the Germanic Confederation, June 8, 1815; and the North German\r\nConfederation, August 18, 1866. In consequence of the success of the\r\nPrussian arms in the war with France (1870-71) the new empire of Germany\r\nwas founded, and the king of Prussia declared emperor, January 18, 1871.\r\n\r\n=Germinal Insurrection.= That of the faubourgs of Paris, suppressed on\r\n12th Germinal, year III. (April 1, 1795).\r\n\r\n=Gerona.= A strong town of Spain, in Catalonia, at the confluence of the\r\nOña and Ter, the latter of which flows through the town. It is built in\r\nthe form of a triangle, at the foot of a steep mountain, and is\r\nsurrounded by walls flanked with fortifications, and covered by a fort\r\nerected on a hill to the north of the town. It was besieged 28 times,\r\nand taken 5 times. In June, 1808, it successfully resisted the French,\r\nbut after suffering much famine surrendered December 12, 1809.\r\n\r\n=Gesate=, or =Gessate= (_Fr._). Formerly a Gallic mercenary soldier, who\r\nvolunteered his services beyond his native country. These adventurers,\r\nor knights-errant, were called _gesates_, either on account of the gese,\r\nor large dart, which they carried, or, as Polybius imagines, on account\r\nof the subsistence they received, which was called by that name.\r\n\r\n=Geserne.= The Anglo-Norman term for battle-axe.\r\n\r\n=Geses and Materes.= Were weapons adopted by the Allobroges (a body of\r\nancient Gauls so called), independently of the broad cut-and-thrust\r\nsword which the Swiss still wear. These instruments were only one cubit\r\nlong; half the blade was nearly square; but it terminated in a round\r\npoint that was exceedingly sharp. Not only the Romans, but the Greeks\r\nreceived it into their armies. The former retained the full appellation\r\nand called it _gese_, but the latter corrupted it into _ysse_. This is\r\nthe only weapon with which those soldiers were armed that escorted\r\nmalefactors, who were condemned to death, to the place of execution. The\r\nterm _gese_ was also applied to a sort of a javelin.\r\n\r\n=Gestic.= Pertaining to deeds or feats of arms; legendary.\r\n\r\n=Gettysburg.= Capital of Adams Co., Pa., situated near the southern\r\nborder of the State, 8 miles from “Mason and Dixon’s line.” Here three\r\ndays’ severe fighting took place on July 1-3, 1863, between the invading\r\nConfederate army under Gens. Lee, Longstreet, and Ewell, and the\r\nFederals under Gen. George G. Meade.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 1, Maj-Gen. Reynolds, in command of the 1st\r\nCorps, advanced on the Emmittsburg road from Marsh Creek to Gettysburg,\r\narriving about 10 o’clock A.M., and marched directly through the town,\r\nand soon after encountered a body of the enemy, which were driven back\r\nby Gen. Buford’s cavalry, which allowed the 1st Corps to form up in\r\norder of battle on a ridge northwest of the town, which sloped to the\r\nwest into a little open valley. Beyond this valley was a ridge of higher\r\nland thickly wooded. Across this valley the line of Gen. Reynolds\r\nadvanced somewhat hastily, almost before it was well formed, and soon\r\nencountered a heavy force of the enemy’s infantry, and was compelled to\r\nfall back, which it did in good order, and by a movement of its left\r\ncentre against the enemy while falling back secured a large number of\r\nprisoners. The Confederate line being broken soon after, Gen. Reynolds\r\nagain prepared to go forward. His line advanced as before, and drove the\r\nenemy from the valley and over the ridge at the farthest side, with a\r\nsevere loss by the heavy fire of the foe. While reconnoitring on this\r\nridge Gen. Reynolds was killed by a shot from the enemy. The 11th Corps\r\nnow arrived and Gen. Howard took command of the whole field, Gen. Schurz\r\ncommanding the 11th Corps. At about half-past 2 P.M. the enemy again\r\nadvanced in force against the 1st Corps, which slowly fell back to its\r\noriginal position northwest of the town. The Confederate force advanced\r\nacross the open space in line of battle, whilst their batteries shelled\r\nthe position of the 1st Corps to cover the advance, but it met a fire so\r\nsharp and well served that it caused it to reel and fall back; the line\r\nwas again formed and reinforced and once more advanced, but with no\r\nbetter success. By this time the line was increased by three more of the\r\nenemy’s divisions, and another charge was made by the whole force of the\r\nenemy. Their superior numbers enabled them to threaten both flanks of\r\nthe Federal force, and notwithstanding a brave resistance the 1st Corps\r\nwas compelled to fall back to the town. By this movement the 11th Corps\r\nwas uncovered, and a heavy advance completely on its right flank\r\ncompelled it to retire. The enemy advanced and took possession of the\r\ntown, while the two corps of the Union troops fell back and occupied the\r\nwest slope of the hill south of the town, held by Gen. Steinwehr. At\r\ndusk the 3d and 12th Corps arrived and next morning the 5th, making in\r\nall six corps, which were placed in position by Gen. Meade, the line\r\nstretching in a semicircle, having its convex centre toward Gettysburg,\r\nwith the extreme toward the south and west. The heights on which they\r\nwere posted sloped gently down from their front. The key of Gen. Meade’s\r\nposition was Cemetery Hill, a little distance south of the town, and on\r\nthe northern slope of which the town itself is situated. The enemy\r\nhaving been largely reinforced during the night were prepared to give\r\nbattle on the morning of the 2d, having formed line on a ridge which ran\r\nnearly parallel to the extreme of that on which the Federal forces were\r\nformed, and separated from them by a valley varying in width from 1 to 2\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nOn the ridge occupied by Gen. Meade 100 guns were in position facing the\r\nenemy, with reserve artillery in the rear about equidistant from the\r\nflanks. The enemy had nearly 150 guns in position. During the forenoon\r\nof the 2d no movement of importance took place, but about noon Gen. Lee\r\nordered a general attack on the Federal centre and left. His movement\r\nbeing discovered by the Union commanders they were prepared, and the 3d\r\nCorps, commanded by Gen. Sickles, was advanced more to the left and\r\nfront in order to be in a more commanding position to repel the\r\nConfederate attack. He had hardly got into position when the enemy\r\nattacked. Having bravely resisted their furious onslaught for about two\r\nhours, and not receiving the expected reinforcements, the 3d Corps was\r\ncompelled to fall back to its previous position, when a most desperate\r\nassault was made upon it by Longstreet’s troops; but this part of the\r\nline being promptly strengthened it repulsed all the efforts of\r\nLongstreet, with great loss, however, on both sides. With the advance of\r\nLongstreet a part of the enemy advanced on the centre of the Union line,\r\nand meeting with stubborn resistance the battle grew fearful. The enemy\r\npressed forward unrestrained. Gens. Sickles, Hancock, and Gibbon were\r\nwounded. The 1st and 2d Corps wavered and the enemy pressed up to the\r\nvery guns of the batteries, which were exposed to capture; but the 6th\r\nCorps, although wearied with marching, hurried up with shouts to the\r\nsupport, and the enemy staggered and drifted slowly back, and being\r\npushed on their left flank by a strong force of the Federals, they\r\nretired. At this time a desperate dash was made by the Confederates on\r\nthe extreme right, which had been weakened to support the centre and\r\nleft. For a short time the attack was furious, but the Federals being\r\nspeedily supported the enemy were kept in check, and finally retired\r\nabout 9 o’clock P.M., having lost the day in every quarter.\r\n\r\nThe battle commenced again on the morning of the 3d by an artillery fire\r\nfrom the Confederate lines, and an aggressive movement of the right of\r\nthe Federal forces under Gen. Slocum to drive Gen. Ewell farther back.\r\nThis attack met with a prompt response from the latter, but Gen. Slocum\r\nhaving been reinforced by part of the 3d and 5th Corps, the struggle was\r\nevenly contested for some time, when additional reinforcements having\r\narrived, the tide of battle was turned in favor of the Union troops,\r\ncausing the enemy to retire, and at 11 o’clock A.M. a general quiet\r\nprevailed. The movements of the morning against Gen. Meade thus far had\r\nbeen made to cover up the designs of the Confederates. The battle of the\r\nprevious day had demonstrated that the issue of the struggle turned on\r\nthe occupation of Cemetery Hill, the key of Gen. Meade’s position. To\r\nget possession of this spot was therefore the object of the enemy.\r\nTherefore Lee massed about 115 guns so as to subject the artillery on\r\nCemetery Hill to more than a half circle of cross-fires. At about 1\r\no’clock P.M. the signal-gun was fired and the cannonading commenced. The\r\nfire of the enemy was concentrated on the position held by the 2d and\r\n11th Corps. It drew a most terrific response from the Federal batteries,\r\nand as has been described by a spectator in the Confederate army, the\r\nalmost simultaneous discharge of over 200 guns “made the air hideous\r\nwith most discordant noise. The very earth shook, and the hills and\r\nrocks seemed to reel like a drunken man. For one hour and a half this\r\nmost terrific fire was continued, during which time the shrieking of\r\nshell, the crash of fallen timbers, the fragments of rocks flying\r\nthrough the air, shattered from the cliffs by solid shot, the heavy\r\nmuttering from the valley between the opposing armies, the splash of\r\nbursting shrapnel, and the fierce neighing of wounded artillery horses,\r\nmade a picture terribly grand and sublime.” At the termination of the\r\nfiring, the left of the Union line was assaulted twice, which were\r\nhandsomely repulsed with severe loss to the Confederates. And thus ended\r\nthe memorable battle of Gettysburg. The forenoon of the 4th was devoted\r\nto the burial of the dead, and in the afternoon the Confederate forces\r\ncommenced to retreat, leaving the Federal forces in possession of the\r\nhard-fought field, which covered the Union troops with the highest\r\nhonor and glory, but at a terrible sacrifice. During the three days the\r\nConfederate losses were 18,000 killed and wounded, and 13,000 missing, a\r\nlarge part of the latter prisoners; making a total of 31,000. The Union\r\nlosses were 16,500 killed and wounded, and 6600 missing, chiefly\r\nprisoners captured on the first and second days, making a total loss of\r\nnot less than 23,000--_Extracts from D. Appleton’s “History of the\r\nRebellion,” by Tenney, “Lippincott’s Gazetteer,” and “Haydn’s Dates_.”\r\n\r\n=Ghaut=, or =Ghât=. A term in India signifying a pass through a range of\r\nhills; also a flight of stairs descending to the rivers for the\r\naccommodation of bathers, and as landing-places for boats.\r\n\r\n=Ghent= (Fr. _Gand_). An ancient fortified city of Belgium, capital of\r\nEast Flanders, situated at the confluence of the Lys and Scheldt. It\r\ncommenced to acquire importance in the 12th century, when its\r\nfortifications were completed.

The city was united to the kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands after the peace of Paris (1814), and is now a rich and\r\npopulous city of Belgium. In this city on December 24, 1814, the terms\r\nof the treaty were agreed on, between the United States and British\r\nenvoys, which put an end to the war of 1812-15.\r\n\r\n=Gheriah.= A town of British India, in the presidency of Bombay.

The “rock” was first fortified in the modern style in\r\nthe reign of Charles V. It was surprised by the English under Sir George\r\nBooke in 1704, soon after the commencement of the War of the Spanish\r\nSuccession, and it has been a British dependency ever since. It has been\r\nrepeatedly besieged, and always without success,--first in 1720, next in\r\n1727, and lastly in 1779, when it stood a siege of upwards of three\r\nyears and a half, the French and Spaniards using their utmost endeavors\r\nto capture it; but every effort was bravely repulsed by the governor,\r\nGen. Elliott.\r\n\r\n=Gibraltar of America.= See QUEBEC.\r\n\r\n=Gib-staff.= In England, a staff to gauge water, or to push a boat.\r\n\r\n=Gin.= In military mechanics, is a machine for raising great weights: it\r\nis composed of three long legs, one of them being longer than the rest,\r\nand called the _pry-pole_. The other two are kept at a proper distance\r\nby means of two iron bars fixed on one of the legs by a staple passing\r\nthrough a hole at one end; the other end has a hook which enters into a\r\nstaple fixed into the other leg so as to be taken off or put on at\r\npleasure. At about 3 feet from the bottom is a windlass, upon which the\r\ncable is wound; and the three legs are joined together at the top by an\r\niron bolt, about which they move; to this bolt is also fixed an iron\r\nclevis to which is hooked the blocks and fall. When the gin stands\r\nupright with legs at a proper distance, one end of the cable is\r\nfastened to a gun, mortar, or other weight; and the other passes through\r\nthe pulleys and about the roller, which is turned round by means of\r\nhand-spikes passing through the holes in the end of the roller; whilst a\r\nman holds the cable tight, the gun is raised to the height required, so\r\nthat the carriage may be put under it. The modern gin has a windlass\r\nwith pawl and ratchet attachments.

The Acilii\r\nGlabriones were plebeian, and first appear on the consular annals in 191\r\nB.C., from which time the name frequently occurs to a late period of the\r\nempire. M. Acilius Glabrio, the most distinguished of the family, became\r\nconsul in 191 B.C. In that year Rome declared war against Antiochus the\r\nGreat, king of Syria. Glabrio was sent against him, and with the aid of\r\nhis ally, Philip II., king of Macedonia, he speedily reduced to\r\nobedience the whole district between the Cambunian mountain-chain and\r\nMount Œta. Antiochus, alarmed at Glabrio’s progress, intrenched himself\r\nstrongly at Thermopylæ; but, although his Ætolian allies occupied the\r\npasses of Mount Œta, the Romans broke through his outposts, and cut to\r\npieces or dispersed his army. Glabrio was engaged in the siege of\r\nAmphissa, when his successor, L. Cornelius Scipio, arrived from Rome and\r\nrelieved him from command.

They are said to\r\nhave been first exhibited by the Etruscans, and to have had their origin\r\nfrom the custom of killing slaves and captives at the funeral pyres of\r\nthe deceased. The first exhibition of gladiators at Rome occurred in 264\r\nB.C. They were at first confined to public funerals, but afterwards\r\nfought at the funerals of most persons of consequence. Combats of\r\ngladiators were also exhibited at entertainments. They consisted either\r\nof captives, slaves, and condemned malefactors, or of free-born\r\ncitizens who fought voluntarily. But it was in the amphitheatre that\r\nthe combats of gladiators most frequently took place. Notice of the\r\nexhibition being given beforehand, thousands flocked to witness the\r\nspectacle. When a gladiator was vanquished by his antagonist, his fate\r\ndepended upon the people, who by a sign indicated whether they wished\r\nhim to be put to death or saved. Shows of gladiators were abolished by\r\nConstantine, but appear, notwithstanding, to have been generally\r\nexhibited till the time of Honorius, by whom they were finally\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\n=Gladsmuir.= A parish in Scotland, in the county of Haddington, in which\r\nthe battle of Gladsmuir, or Prestonpans, was fought.\r\n\r\n=Glaire.= A broadsword or a falchion fixed on a pike.\r\n\r\n=Glais, Militaire= (_Fr._).

The larger this gorge is,\r\nthe better is the defense; for when the ruined bastion is about to fall\r\nby siege into the hands of the enemy, the defenders can construct\r\ndefensive works or dig small ditches in the gorge of the abandoned\r\nbastion. Such resistance sometimes drives the besiegers to the necessity\r\nof battering in breach the curtain.\r\n\r\n=Gorge of Mountains.= Is the passage, more or less compressed, between\r\ntwo mountains, which is used as a passage-way into valleys. Gorges are\r\nimportant military points. If they lead to an intrenched camp, it is\r\nnecessary to fortify them, and there post grand guards; these positions\r\nare the principal theatres for affairs of posts.\r\n\r\n=Gorged.= In heraldry, when an animal is represented with a crown round\r\nits neck, it is said to be gorged.\r\n\r\n=Gorgerin= (_Fr._). In ancient times, that part of the armor which\r\ncovered the neck of a man. Hence our word _gorget_.\r\n\r\n=Gorget= (Ital. _gorgietta_, from _gorga_, a throat). That part of\r\nancient armor which defended the neck. Also a crescent-shaped ornament\r\nformerly worn by military officers on the breast.\r\n\r\n=Gorgons.= In military antiquity, a warlike female nation of Lybia, in\r\nAfrica, who had frequent quarrels with another nation of the same sex,\r\ncalled _Amazons_.\r\n\r\n=Gothard, St.= The pass of St. Gothard is one of the best and most\r\nfrequented routes across the Alps. On the northern slope is the\r\ncelebrated Devil’s Bridge across the Ruess. The French and Russians had\r\nseveral combats here in 1799.\r\n\r\n=Gothland.= An island in the Baltic Sea. It was conquered by the\r\nTeutonic knights, 1397-98; given up to the Danes, 1524; to Sweden, 1645;\r\nconquered by the Danes, 1677, and restored to Sweden, 1679.\r\n\r\n=Goths.= A warlike nation that inhabited the country between the\r\nCaspian, Pontus, Euxine, and Baltic Seas. They entered Mœsia, took\r\nPhilippopolis, massacring thousands of its inhabitants; defeated and\r\nkilled the emperor Decius, 251; but were defeated by Claudius, 320,000\r\nbeing slain. Aurelian ceded Dacia to them in 272; but they long troubled\r\nthe empire. After the destruction of the Roman empire by the Heruli, the\r\n_Ostrogoths_, under Theodoric, became masters of the greater part of\r\nItaly, where they retained their dominion till 553, when they were\r\nfinally conquered by Narses, Justinian’s general. The _Visigoths_\r\nsettled in Spain, and founded a kingdom, which continued until the\r\ncountry was subdued by the Saracens.\r\n\r\n=Gotthard, St.= Near the river Raab, Hungary. Here the Turks under the\r\ngrand vizier Kupriuli were totally defeated by the Imperialists and\r\ntheir allies, commanded by Montecuculli, August 1, 1664. Peace followed\r\nthis great victory.\r\n\r\n=Goudrons= (_Fr._). Small fascines, or fagots, which are well steeped in\r\nwax, pitch, and glue, and then are lighted for the purpose of setting\r\nfire to beams, planks, traverses, galleries, pontons, etc. They are\r\nlikewise used in various shapes and ways, to convey light into the\r\nditches, or upon the ramparts.\r\n\r\n=Goujat= (_Fr._). A soldier’s boy. It likewise signifies an ignorant,\r\ngood-for-nothing fellow.\r\n\r\n=Gourdin= (_Fr._). A flat stick, two fingers in breadth, which was used\r\nby the French to punish galley-slaves.\r\n\r\n=Government.= The Constitution of the United States provides that\r\nCongress shall make rules for the government and regulation of armies.\r\nBy government is understood not only the body of fundamental laws of a\r\nstate, but also the body of persons charged with the management of the\r\nexecutive power of a country; direction, power or authority which rules\r\na community; administration; rule; management. Government of the\r\nmilitary is that branch of the code which embraces the creation and\r\nregulation of the military hierarchy, or the gradual distribution of\r\ninferior authority. The power of making rules of government is that of\r\n_supreme command_, and from this living principle proceed the\r\nlocalization of troops, their organization and distribution; rules for\r\nrewards and punishments; and generally, all rules of government and\r\n_regulation_ whatsoever, which the legislature may judge necessary to\r\nmaintain an efficient and well-disciplined army. All authority over the\r\nland forces of the United States must, therefore, be derived from\r\nCongress. For, although the President is the commander-in-chief, yet his\r\nfunctions, as such, must be regulated by Congress, under the 17th clause\r\nof Sec. 8 of the Constitution, as well as under the general authority of\r\nCongress to make rules for the government and regulation of the land\r\nforces. The President cannot be divested of power which Congress may\r\nassign to any inferior military commander, because the authority of the\r\ngreater includes that of the less. But all the authority over the land\r\nand naval forces, save the _appointment_ of the commander-in-chief,\r\nrests with Congress, and no authority can be exercised not delegated by\r\nCongress, except such as may be fairly deduced from powers given for the\r\neffective discharge of the duties annexed to his office.\r\n\r\n=Government’s Island.= See ROCK ISLAND.\r\n\r\n=Governor.= An officer placed by royal commission in the military\r\ncommand of a fortress, not only over the garrison but over the\r\ninhabitants. In time of war it is an office of great responsibility, and\r\nat all times requires considerable experience and military information.\r\nAlso, in the United States, one who is invested with supreme authority\r\nin a State.\r\n\r\n=Governor’s Island.= An island in New York harbor, about a mile and a\r\nhalf south of the City Hall. It belongs to the United States, and is\r\nstrongly fortified by Fort Columbus, Castle Williams, and a battery\r\ncommanding the entrance to Buttermilk Channel, the channel which\r\nseparates the island from Brooklyn. The ordnance department has a depot\r\nhere. It is now the headquarters of the military division of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\n=Gowrie Conspiracy.= One of the most singular events in the history of\r\nScotland took place in August, 1600. John Ruthven, earl of Gowrie, and\r\nothers entered into a conspiracy to possess themselves of the king’s\r\n(James VI.) person, to convey him to England and to administer the\r\ngovernment in the interest of the Presbyterian leaders at home. They\r\nsucceeded in enticing the king to the Gowrie House at Perth, and after\r\nthey had held him as a prisoner were almost successful in dismissing his\r\nattendants without exciting suspicion; but the king crying out for\r\nassistance his voice was instantly recognized; his attendants hastened\r\nto the rescue, and quickly dispatched the earl and his brother\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\n=Grade.= Synonymous with rank; peculiarly applicable to the different\r\nranks among officers, beginning from an ensign to the commander-in-chief\r\nof an army.\r\n\r\n=Gradivus.= A surname of Mars (which see).\r\n\r\n=Grain.= See FORAGE.\r\n\r\n=Grainoir=, or =Grénoir= (_Fr._). A term used in the French artillery to\r\nsignify a sort of sieve, in which there are small round holes for moist\r\npowder to be passed through, in order to make the grains perfectly\r\nround.\r\n\r\n=Gran.= A town of Hungary, on the right bank of the Danube, 25 miles\r\nnorthwest of Pesth. It is one of the oldest towns of Hungary, was\r\nformerly fortified, and has undergone assaults and sieges almost without\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n=Granada.= A city of Southern Spain, founded by the Moors in the 8th\r\ncentury. It formed at first part of the kingdom of Cordova. In 1236,\r\nMohammed-al-Hamar made it the capital of his new kingdom of Granada,\r\nwhich was subjugated by the “great captain,” Gonsalvo de Cordova, in\r\n1492. Granada was taken by Marshal Soult in 1810, and held till 1812.\r\n\r\n=Granada, New.= The name formerly given to the republic now known as the\r\nUnited States of Colombia (which see).\r\n\r\n=Grand.= This word is frequently used, both in French and English, to\r\nindicate superiority of position, force, or display; as _grand master_,\r\n_grand army_, _grand march_, _grand parade_, etc.\r\n\r\n=Grand Division.= A battalion or regiment being told off by two\r\ncompanies to each division, is said to be told off in grand divisions;\r\nhence, grand-division firing is when the battalion fires by two\r\ncompanies at the same time, and is commanded by one officer only.\r\n\r\n=Grand Guard.= The main guard of an army; the guard covering the army or\r\ncamp from an attack by the enemy; other guards are called _interior\r\nguards_.\r\n\r\n=Grand Master.= The title of the head of the military orders, the\r\nHospitallers, the Templars, and the Teutonic knights.\r\n\r\n=Grand Master of Cross-bows.= The _personnel_ of the French artillery\r\nwas for a long time prior to 1420 retained, together with the engineers,\r\nunder the general direction of an officer who was titled “grand master\r\nof cross-bows.” In 1420 the master-general of artillery was made\r\nindependent of this officer.\r\n\r\n=Grand Rounds.= See ROUNDS.\r\n\r\n=Grand Tactics.= See TACTICS.\r\n\r\n=Granicus.= A river in Northwestern Asia Minor, near which, on May 22,\r\n334 B.C., Alexander the Great signally defeated the Persians. The\r\nMacedonian troops (30,000 foot and 5000 horse) crossed the Granicus in\r\nthe face of the Persian army (600,000 foot and 20,000 horse). Sardis\r\ncapitulated, Miletus and Halicarnassus were taken by storm, and other\r\ngreat towns submitted to the conqueror.\r\n\r\n=Granson=, or =Grandson=. A town of Switzerland, canton of Valid, on the\r\nsouthwest shore of the Lake of Neufchâtel, 20 miles north of Lausanne.\r\nNear it the Burgundians under Charles the Rash were defeated by the\r\nSwiss with great loss, March 8, 1476.\r\n\r\n=Granville.= A fortified seaport of France, in the department of La\r\nManche, on a rocky peninsula 12 miles northwest from Avranches. In 1695\r\nthis place was burned by the English, and in 1793 it was besieged by the\r\nVendeans.\r\n\r\n=Grape-shot.= A certain number of iron balls, usually nine, put together\r\nby means of two cast-iron plates, two rings, and one pin and nut. Each\r\nplate has on the inside three beds for the shot, of a depth equal to\r\nhalf the thickness of the plate and of the form of a spherical segment,\r\nthe curvature of which is the same as that of the shot. An iron pin\r\nriveted to the bottom iron plate passes through the centre and also\r\nthrough the top plate, where the whole is secured by a nut and screw. In\r\nthe United States the use of these shot for field-pieces has been\r\ndiscontinued, canister answering the purpose. (See CANISTER-SHOT.) In\r\nthe old pattern, the balls were placed in tiers around an iron pin\r\nattached to an iron tampion at the bottom, put into a canvas bag, and\r\nthen quilted around with a strong cord.\r\n\r\n=Grapple.= To seize; to contend in close fight; to attach one’s self as\r\nif by a grapple, as in wrestling; hence to _grapple with_, to enter into\r\ncontest with, resolutely and courageously.\r\n\r\n=Grappling.= A laying fast hold of; also, that by which anything is\r\nseized and held.\r\n\r\n=Grasp.= The handle of a sword, and of an oar. Also, the small part of\r\nthe stock of a musket.\r\n\r\n=Grass-cutters.= Followers of cavalry regiments in India, whose duty it\r\nis to go forth and collect green forage for the horses.\r\n\r\n=Grassin= (_Fr._). An ancient name for militia composed of light troops.\r\n\r\n=Gratification.= In a general acceptation of the term, this word meant,\r\namong the French, certain rewards which generals gave to the troops,\r\nafter a severe engagement, in testimony of their valor and good conduct.\r\nThese rewards were distributed according to rank. This custom was\r\nprevalent in the most ancient times. By gratification was likewise meant\r\nthe accumulation of a certain sum, which was deposited for the specific\r\npurpose of burying a deceased soldier. This term also meant a certain\r\nallowance in money allotted to prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n=Gratuity.= An allowance to officers of the British service in the\r\nIndian army, varying with their rank. This and other allowances, such as\r\nbatta, tentage, etc., had been granted for the purpose of augmenting an\r\nofficer’s emoluments in India, without giving him a claim to a higher\r\nrate of net paper when on furlough in England. Gratuities are allowed to\r\nofficers in the French service at the beginning of a campaign.\r\n\r\n=Gravelines.= A small fortified town and seaport of France, in the\r\ndepartment of Nord, 12 miles southwest of Dunkirk. Here Count d’Egmont\r\nobtained a victory over the French army commanded by Marshal de Thermes\r\nin 1558. Ten years later, it was taken by Louis XIV., who had it\r\nfortified by Vauban.\r\n\r\n=Gravelotte, Battle of.= Also called the battle of Rézonville, the\r\nbloodiest battle of the Franco-German war, took place August 18, 1870.\r\nIt was gained by the German armies, commanded by the king in person,\r\nafter twelve hours’ hard fighting. The most desperate struggle took\r\nplace on the slopes over Gravelotte, which the Germans gained by\r\nnightfall, after repeated charges, the fortune of the day being long in\r\nsuspense. But the right of the French had been outflanked, they fell\r\nback fighting to the last, and retired under cover of Metz. The French\r\nare said to have lost 19,000, including officers and men, besides a\r\nlarge number of prisoners; and the Germans, 25,000.\r\n\r\n=Graveurs= (_Fr._). Persons employed and paid by the founders of cannon\r\nfor repairing damaged pieces of artillery. Some individual, however, was\r\ndistinguished by the name of _graveur de l’artillerie_ (engraver to the\r\nartillery), and was permitted by the grand master of the ordnance to\r\nexhibit over his shop door the arms of the royal artillery.\r\n\r\n=Gravimetric Density of Gunpowder.= Is the weight of a measured\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n=Gravity.= Is the tendency of all bodies towards the centre of the\r\nearth. The force of gravity is in the inverse proportion to the square\r\nof the body’s distance from the centre of the earth. The specific\r\ngravity of a body is the ratio of the weight of a body to that of an\r\nequal volume of some other body assumed as a standard, usually pure\r\ndistilled water at a certain temperature for solids and liquids, and air\r\nfor gases.\r\n\r\n=Graze.= The point at which a shot strikes and rebounds from earth or\r\nwater. _Grazing-fire_, that which sweeps close to the surface it\r\ndefends.\r\n\r\n=Great Britain.= See BRITAIN, GREAT.\r\n\r\n=Great-coat.= A soldier’s overcoat is so called.\r\n\r\n=Great Fortification.= One of the divisions of the first systems of\r\nVauban. It consists in a fortification whose exterior side is from 185\r\nto 260 toises, or from 370 to 520 yards, and is seldom adopted but\r\ntowards a river or a marsh.\r\n\r\n=Great Radius.= In fortification, the whole oblique radius.\r\n\r\n=Greaves.= Were a kind of armor for the legs, worn both by the Greek and\r\nRoman soldiers; the latter having adopted them from the former. They\r\nwere made of brass, copper, tin, or other metals. The sides were closed\r\nabout the ankles with buttons of gold, silver, etc. This kind of\r\ndefensive armor was at first peculiar to the Grecians. The Etruscans had\r\nthem, apparently of rough hides, fastened behind by a single ligature\r\nnear the middle of the calf; these subsequently gave way to buskins.\r\nServius Tullius introduced the Etruscan greaves among the Romans; but\r\nfrom the time of the republic the word _ochrea_ applied to the laced-up\r\nboots, which succeeded them.\r\n\r\n=Greece=, or =Hellas, Kingdom of=. The ancient Græcia, a maritime\r\ncountry in the southeast of Europe. In the early ages the Greeks were\r\ngoverned by monarchs; but the monarchical power gradually decreased, and\r\nthe love of liberty led to the establishment of the republican form of\r\ngovernment. No part of Greece, except Macedonia, remained in the hands\r\nof an absolute sovereign. The expedition of the Argonauts first, and, in\r\nthe succeeding age, the wars of Thebes and Troy, gave opportunity to\r\ntheir warriors, who afterwards ranked as heroes and demigods, to display\r\ntheir valor in the field of battle. The spirit of Greece, however, was\r\ncrushed by the Romans; and in 1718 she became a Turkish province. In\r\n1821 the ancient spirit seemed to have revived in the modern Greeks, and\r\nthey determined to be free. The struggle was severe and protracted; but,\r\nby the interference of the great European powers, the Turks were forced\r\nto acknowledge Greece an independent state in 1829.\r\n\r\n=Greek Fire.= A combustible composition (now unknown, but thought to\r\nhave been principally naphtha), thrown from engines said to have been\r\ninvented by Callinicus, an ingenious engineer of Heliopolis, in Syria,\r\nin the 7th century, in order to destroy the Saracens’ ships, which was\r\neffected by the general of the fleet of Constantine, Pogonatus, and\r\n30,000 men were killed. A so-called “Greek fire,” probably a solution of\r\nphosphorus in bisulphide of carbon, was employed at the siege of\r\nCharleston, U. S., in September, 1863. Greek fire, as now understood, is\r\nsimply a solid, highly combustible composition, consisting of sulphur\r\nand phosphorus dissolved in the bisulphide of carbon, to which\r\noccasionally some mineral oil is added, with the view of increasing its\r\nincendiary powers. When the liquid is thrown on any surface exposed to\r\nthe air the solvent evaporates, leaving a film of the phosphorus or\r\nsulphide of phosphorus, which then inflames spontaneously. The proper\r\nmode of extinguishing such a fire is to throw damp sand, ashes, sawdust,\r\nor lime, wet sacking or carpeting; in short, any material which will\r\nexclude the air from the fire. No attempt should be made to remove the\r\ncovering for some time after the flame has been extinguished. The place\r\nshould afterwards be thoroughly washed by a powerful jet of water forced\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n=Greener’s Bullet.= One of the first attempts to make a bullet take the\r\ngrooves by the expanding action of the powder was by Mr. Greener, an\r\nEnglish gunsmith, in 1836. He used a conical pewter wedge, which was\r\ndriven into a cavity in the base of the bullet by the powder and forced\r\nthe outer walls of the bullet into the grooves.\r\n\r\n=Grenada.= An island in the West Indies belonging to the Windward group.\r\nIt was discovered by Columbus in the year 1498. It was originally\r\nsettled by the French, but was taken by the British in 1762, to whom it\r\nwas confirmed by the peace of Paris in 1763.\r\n\r\n=Grenade.= In gunnery, is a shell thrown from the hand, or in barrels\r\nfrom mortars of large caliber, and ignited as other shells by means of a\r\nfuze. There are hand-grenades and rampart-grenades; old 6-pounder\r\nspherical-case may be used for the former, and shells of any caliber for\r\nthe latter. Grenades are useful in the defense of works, the smaller,\r\nthrown by hand into the head of a sap, trenches, covered way, or upon\r\nthe besiegers mounting a breach; the larger kinds are rolled over the\r\nparapet in a trough. Hand-grenades are intended to be used against the\r\nenemy when he has reached such parts of the defenses (the bottom of the\r\nditch for example) as are not covered by the guns, or the muskets of the\r\ninfantry posted on the banquettes. After the enemy has passed the abatis\r\nand jumped into the ditch, hand-grenades will be used; and then if he\r\nmounts the parapet, he must be met there with the bayonet. _Ketchum’s\r\nhand-grenade_ is a small oblong percussion shell which explodes on\r\nstriking the object.\r\n\r\n=Grenadier.= Originally a soldier who was employed in throwing\r\nhand-grenades, but in some modern armies a member of the first company\r\nof every battalion of foot, in which the tallest and finest men of the\r\nregiment are placed.\r\n\r\n=Grenadier Guards.= The first regiment of foot guards in the British\r\nHousehold Brigade of Guards, and generally considered the finest corps\r\nin the army. It comprises 2697 officers and men, divided into three\r\nbattalions. The officers of this fashionable corps are usually from the\r\nfamilies of the nobility, or more distinguished landed gentry. The 1st\r\nFoot Guards, under which name the regiment was originally known, was\r\nfirst raised in 1660. The Grenadier Guards distinguished themselves in\r\nthe Peninsula, at Waterloo, and in the Crimea.\r\n\r\n=Grenadiers Auxiliaries= (_Fr._). Auxiliary grenadiers. During a siege,\r\nand when a place was closely invested, a certain number of grenadiers\r\nwere chosen out of the battalions belonging to the trenches, for the\r\npurpose of making head against the besieged, whenever they might risk a\r\nsally, or assault the works. It was the peculiar duty of these men to\r\nstand forward on every occasion, to set fire to the gabions attached to\r\nthe batteries, and to crush every attempt which might be made by the\r\ngarrison to annoy the men that were posted in the trenches, etc.\r\n\r\n=Grenadiers, Horse.= Called by the French _grenadiers volans_, or flying\r\ngrenadiers, are such as are mounted on horseback, but fight both on foot\r\nand on horseback. They were first established in France by Louis XIV. in\r\n1676, and formed in squadrons.\r\n\r\n=Grenado.= The ancient term for a live shell.\r\n\r\n=Grenoble.= A fortified town of France, in the department of the Isère.\r\nThe town is surrounded with fortifications, and the heights which\r\ncommand the town are also fortified. This was the first place which\r\nopenly received Napoleon I. on his escape from Elba, in 1815.\r\n\r\n=Gribeauval’s System of Artillery.= About 1765 various improvements were\r\nintroduced into European artillery by Gen. Gribeauval. He separated\r\n_field_ from _siege_ artillery, lightened and shortened field-guns and\r\ndiminished the charges. He adopted elevating screws and tangent scales,\r\nstrengthened the carriages, and introduced neater uniformity in the\r\ndimensions, enabling spare parts to be carried for repairs.\r\n\r\n=Grices.= In heraldry, are young wild boars.\r\n\r\n=Griffe= (_Fr._). Means literally a claw; but in a military sense, as\r\naccepted by the French, it signifies an iron instrument which is made\r\nlike a hook, and is used by miners to pick out the small stones that are\r\nincorporated with cement, etc.\r\n\r\n=Griffin.= A fabulous animal, usually represented in heraldry with the\r\nbody and hind legs of a lion, and the beak, wings, and claws of an\r\neagle.\r\n\r\n=Griffin Gun.= A name sometimes given to the 3-inch rifle used in the\r\nU. S. field service from its inventor, Mr. Griffin, of the Phœnixville\r\nIron-Works, Pa., where the gun was made.\r\n\r\n=Grip.= The handle of a sword.\r\n\r\n=Grisons.= The largest of all the cantons of Switzerland. The country\r\nwas anciently inhabited by the Rhætii; it was conquered by the Roman\r\nemperor Constantius in the 4th century, and his camp (_Curia_, _Chur_,\r\nor _Coire_, the name of the present capital) was planted on the Rhine.\r\nIn the 10th century the country of the Grisons was added to the German\r\nempire, and remained till 1268 subject to the Swabian dukes. With the\r\ndecay of the imperial authority it came to be oppressed by a numerous\r\nnobility, the ruins of whose castles still crown the heights. Against\r\nthem the people began, in the end of the 14th century, to form leagues\r\nin the different valleys. In 1472, these separate unions entered into a\r\ngeneral confederation, which then formed an alliance with the Swiss\r\ncantons, but it was not till 1803 that it was admitted into the Swiss\r\nConfederation as the fifteenth canton. Grisons was overrun by the French\r\nin 1798 and 1799.\r\n\r\n=Grochow.= Near Prague, a suburb of Warsaw. Here took place a desperate\r\nconflict between the Poles and Russians, February 19-20, 1831, the\r\nformer remaining masters of the field of battle. The Russians shortly\r\nafter retreated, having been foiled in their attempt to take Warsaw.\r\nThey are said to have lost 7000 men, and the Poles 2000.\r\n\r\n=Grognard= (_Fr._). Grumbler; an old soldier of the French empire was so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n=Groma= (_Fr._). A Roman measuring-rod, 20 feet long, used for setting\r\noff distances in a camp.\r\n\r\n=Grommet.= Consists of a ring of rope-yarn, with two pieces of strong\r\ntwine tied across at right angles to each other. Grommets are used as\r\nwads for cannon. The size of the ring is the full diameter of the bore\r\nof the piece, in order that it may fit tight, and stop the windage. They\r\nincrease the accuracy of fire, and are to be preferred when the object\r\nof the wad is merely to retain the projectile in its place, as in firing\r\nat a depression. They stop the windage best when placed behind the\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\n=Groom.= One of several officers of the English royal household, chiefly\r\nin the lord chamberlain’s department; as the groom of the chamber; groom\r\nof the stole, or robes.\r\n\r\n=Groom-porter.= An officer in the household of the king of England, who\r\nsucceeded the master of revels, and gave directions as to sports.\r\n\r\n=Grooved Ball.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Grooved Bullet.= See BULLET.\r\n\r\n=Grooves.= Spiral grooves or “rifles” cut into the surface of the bore\r\nof fire-arms, have the effect of communicating a rotary motion to a\r\nprojectile around an axis coincident with its flight. This motion\r\nincreases the range of the projectile, and also corrects one of the\r\ncauses of deviation by distributing it uniformly around the line of\r\nflight. There are two kinds of twist used,--uniform and increasing.\r\nIncreasing twists are supposed to give greater accuracy, and are well\r\nadapted to expanding projectiles which have but short bearing in the\r\ngrooves. They are also used for stud projectiles. The uniform twist is\r\ngenerally applicable and has many advantages. In small-arms at the\r\npresent time the bullet used has such a long bearing in the grooves that\r\nan increasing twist is not desirable. The ordinary twist is\r\nright-handed, giving a _drift_ to the right. The _gras_, the official\r\narm of France, has a left-handed twist. In regard to number and form of\r\ngrooves authorities differ. The polygroove (or many small grooves)\r\nsystem has given very accurate results, especially in breech-loading\r\ncannon. It is in great favor on the continent of Europe. The French\r\nsystem, also used in a modified form in Woolwich and Elswick guns,\r\nconsists of a few deep grooves in which the studs of the projectile\r\nmove. The objection to this system is the weakening of the gun and the\r\ngreat strain when fired. For expanding projectiles, experiment shows\r\nthat broad and shallow grooves with a moderate twist give range,\r\nendurance, accuracy of fire, and facility in loading and cleaning the\r\nbores. The proper twist to be given to the grooves depends on the\r\nlength, diameter, and initial velocity of the projectile used; the most\r\nsuitable twist is best determined by experiment. Other things being\r\nequal, the longer the projectile the more rapid the rotation necessary\r\nto steady it; the greater the diameter the less rapid the rotation. As\r\nthe initial velocity is increased, the rotation must be increased. The\r\nfarther forward the centre of inertia of the projectile, the less the\r\ntendency to tumble. The tendency in modern small-arms is to shorten the\r\ntwist on account of large charges and long bullets. Grooved bullets are\r\nbest suited to broad shallow grooves; patched bullets to a greater\r\nnumber of sharp-edged grooves.\r\n\r\n=Gros= (_Fr._). A body of soldiers; a detachment. The French frequently\r\nsay, _Un gros de cavalerie_, a body of cavalry; _un gros d’infanterie_,\r\na body of infantry.\r\n\r\n=Gros Ventres Indians.= A tribe of aborigines living in Dakota and\r\nMontana. They received their name Gros Ventres, “Big Bellies,” from the\r\nCanadian _voyageurs_ of the Hudson Bay Company. They are peaceably\r\ndisposed, and are mostly located at Fort Berthold agency, Dakota, and at\r\nFort Peck, Montana. See INDIANS AND THEIR AGENCIES.\r\n\r\n=Groton.= A village of New London Co., Conn., on the east side of Thames\r\nRiver, opposite New London. It is famous as being the scene of the\r\nmassacre perpetrated by British troops under Arnold. Old Fort Griswold,\r\ncommanded by the brave Ledyard, who was barbarously slain with his own\r\nsword after he had surrendered, is still standing on Groton Heights; and\r\na granite obelisk has been erected to commemorate the patriotism of\r\nthose who perished.\r\n\r\n=Ground.= In a military sense, the field or place of action. _To take\r\nground_; a battalion or company is said to take ground when it extends\r\nin any given direction. This term is likewise used in dueling; as, they\r\n_took their ground_ at eight or ten paces from each other.\r\n\r\n=Ground Arms.= An old word of command, on which the soldiers laid down\r\ntheir arms upon the ground.\r\n\r\n=Ground-work.= See FOUNDATION.\r\n\r\n=Grynia=, or =Grynium=. A very ancient fortified city on the coast of\r\nthe Sinus Elaiticus, in the south of Mysia. Parmenio, the general of\r\nAlexander, destroyed the city and sold the inhabitants as slaves, after\r\nwhich the place seems to have decayed.\r\n\r\n=Guadaloupe.= An island in the West Indies, and one of the largest and\r\nmost valuable of the Leeward group. This island was first discovered by\r\nColumbus. It was taken possession of by the French in 1635, who drove\r\nthe natives into the mountains. In 1759 it was taken by a British\r\nsquadron, and was restored to France at the peace of 1763. It was again\r\ntaken by the British in 1794; but was retaken by the French in 1795. In\r\n1810 the British once more took possession of it, and in 1814 restored\r\nit to the French, to whom it now belongs.\r\n\r\n=Guad-el-ras.= In Northwestern Africa. Here the Spaniards signally\r\ndefeated the Moors, March 23, 1860, after a severe conflict, in which\r\nGen. Prim manifested great bravery, for which he was ennobled.\r\n\r\n=Guanches.= The original inhabitants of the Canary Islands, who were\r\nsupposed to have come from the adjoining coast of Africa. In the 15th\r\ncentury many of these people fell in opposing the Spanish invasion; many\r\nwere sold by the conquerors as slaves, and many conformed to the Roman\r\nCatholic faith, and intermarried with the Spaniards; so that all trace\r\nof them as a distinct race is lost. They were celebrated for their tall\r\nstature, and were styled by Humboldt the Patagonians of the Old World.\r\n\r\n=Guarantee Association, The British.= An association which, for a small\r\npercentage, undertakes to vouch for the prudence and fidelity of such\r\npublic officers (military) as paymasters, ordnance store-keepers,\r\ncommissaries, staff-officers of pensions, barrack-masters, etc. The\r\ngovernment accepts the guarantee of this particular office in preference\r\nto that offered by private individuals.\r\n\r\n=Guard.= A body of men whose duty it is to secure an army or place from\r\nbeing surprised by an enemy. In garrison the guards are relieved every\r\nday. _On guard_ is being engaged on guard duty.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Advanced.= See ADVANCED GUARD.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Baggage.= A guard who has the care of the baggage on a march.\r\n\r\n=Guard-chamber.= A guard-room.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Counter-.= See COUNTER-GUARDS.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Detail.= The men from a company, regiment, or other organization\r\ndetailed for guard duty.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Dismounting.= The act of coming off guard.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Forage.= A detachment sent out to secure foragers.

This guard consists both of horse and foot,\r\nwho must remain on their posts till the foragers are all come off the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Grand.= The main guard of a camp or army. See GRAND GUARD.\r\n\r\n=Guard-house.= A building occupied by the guard. The prisoners being\r\nkept in the building, it is frequently used as a synonym for prison-room\r\nor lock-up. _To take one to the guard-house_, is to confine him.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Magazine-.= See GARDES-MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Main.= Is that from which all other guards are detached, and\r\nconstitutes the chief guard of a garrison.\r\n\r\n=Guard Mess.= Is the table which is kept for the officers of the Life\r\nand Foot Guards in St. James’ Palace. The sum of £4000 per annum is\r\nallowed for the mess.\r\n\r\n=Guard Mounting.= The act of going on guard. The military ceremony of\r\nmarching on guard.\r\n\r\n=Guard of Honor.= A guard drawn up to receive eminent personages, as a\r\nmark of respect, or to accompany them.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Picket.= An outpost guard for the purpose of preventing a\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Police.= The interior guard of a camp or army in charge of arms,\r\nproperty, tents, etc. Also a guard in charge of prisoners engaged in\r\npolicing a camp or garrison.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Provost-.= See PROVOST-GUARD.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Quarter.= The guard which is posted in front of a camp.\r\n\r\n=Guard, Rear-.= The guard posted in rear of a camp.

It contains a statement\r\nof duties performed, of hours at which the guard was visited by the\r\nofficer of the day or field-officer, a list of government property and\r\nits condition, and also of the prisoners handed over to the guard, with\r\nthe charge against each, together with the name of the officer by whom\r\nthe prisoner was confined.\r\n\r\n=Guard Tent.= Tent occupied by the guard.\r\n\r\n=Guardable.= Capable of being guarded or protected.\r\n\r\n=Guardiagrele.= An old town of Southern Italy, in the province of\r\nChieti. Belisarius surrounded it with a turreted wall as a defense\r\nagainst the Goths. It was often besieged during the Middle Ages, and in\r\n1799 was mercilessly sacked and burned by the French.\r\n\r\n=Guards.= In the British service constitute in time of peace the\r\ngarrison of London, and the guard of the sovereign at Windsor. The\r\nGuards compose what is called the Household Brigade, and include in\r\ncavalry the 1st and 2d Life Guards, and the Royal Horse Guards; and in\r\ninfantry the Grenadier Guards, the Coldstream Guards, and the Scots\r\nFusilier Guards. The officers of the regiments of Foot Guards hold\r\nhigher army rank than that they bear regimentally,--that is, ensigns\r\nrank with lieutenants of other regiments, lieutenants with captains, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n=Guards, Imperial.= The name of a body of select troops organized by the\r\nFrench emperor, Napoleon I., which greatly distinguished themselves at\r\nAusterlitz.\r\n\r\n=Guards’ Institute.= An establishment in London; it consists of\r\nreading-, lecture-rooms, etc., for all officers and soldiers in the\r\nmetropolis. It was inaugurated by the Duke of Cambridge, July 11, 1867.\r\n\r\n=Guards, The Horse Grenadier.= Formerly a body of horse guards in the\r\nBritish service; the first troop was raised in 1693, and the second in\r\n1702. This corps was reduced in 1783, the officers retiring on full pay.\r\n\r\n=Guastadours= (_Fr._). Turkish pioneers. Armenians and Greeks are\r\ngenerally employed in the Turkish armies to do the fatigue-work that is\r\nnecessary for the formation of a camp, or for conducting a siege.\r\n\r\n=Guastalla.= A city in Northern Italy, near which the imperial army,\r\ncommanded by the king of Sardinia, was defeated by the French, September\r\n19, 1734. The ancient district of that name, long held by the dukes of\r\nMantua, was seized by the emperor of Germany, 1746, and ceded to Parma,\r\n1748. After having been comprised in the Italian republic, 1796, and\r\nsubjected to other changes, it was annexed to Parma, 1815, and to\r\nModena, 1847.\r\n\r\n=Guatemala.= A republic in Central America, declared independent March\r\n21, 1847. A war between Guatemala and San Salvador broke out in January,\r\n1863, and on June 16 the troops of the latter were totally defeated.\r\n\r\n=Guatuso Indians.= A tribe of aborigines living on the Rio Frio, in\r\nCentral America. They are said to be a brave and warlike race.\r\n\r\n=Gubbio= (anc. _Iguvium_). A city of Central Italy, 27 miles south of\r\nUrbino, on the southern declivity of the Apennines. It bore a\r\nconspicuous part in the beginning of the civil war between Cæsar and\r\nPompey, when it was occupied by the prætor Minucius Thermus with five\r\ncohorts; but on the approach of Curio with three cohorts, Thermus, who\r\nwas apprehensive of a revolt of the citizens, abandoned the town without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n=Gudda.= An Indian term for a fool; also a small fort erected upon a\r\nhill or eminence.\r\n\r\n=Guelphs and Ghibellines.= Names given to the papal and imperial\r\nfactions who destroyed the peace of Italy from the 12th to the end of\r\nthe 15th century (the invasion of Charles VIII. of France in 1495). The\r\norigin of the names is ascribed to the contest for the imperial crown\r\nbetween Conrad of Hohenstaufen, duke of Swabia, lord of Wiblingen (hence\r\n_Ghibelin_), and Henry, nephew of Wolf, or Guelf, duke of Bavaria, in\r\n1138. The former was successful; but the popes and several Italian\r\ncities took the side of his rival. _Hie Guelf_ and _Hie Ghibelin_ are\r\nsaid to have been used as war-cries in 1140, at the battle before\r\nWeinsberg, in Würtemberg, when Guelf of Bavaria was defeated by the\r\nemperor Conrad IV., who came to help the rival duke, Leopold. The\r\nGhibellines were almost totally expelled from Italy in 1267, when\r\nConrad, the last of the Hohenstaufens, was beheaded by Charles of Anjou.\r\nGuelph is the name of the present royal family of England.\r\n\r\n=Guelphs, Order of.= An order of knighthood for Hanover, instituted by\r\nGeorge IV., when regent, on August 12, 1815. It is both a military and\r\ncivil order, unlimited in number, and consisted originally of three\r\nclasses,--Knights Grand Cross, Commanders, and Knights; but in 1841\r\nanother class of simple members was added to the order.\r\n\r\n=Guerite= (_Fr._). A sentry-box, small turret. In fortified towns there\r\nare several small turrets of this denomination, which are sometimes made\r\nof wood, and sometimes built with stones. They are generally fixed to\r\nthe acute points of bastions, and sentinels are posted within them for\r\nthe purpose of watching the ditch, and of preventing any surprise in\r\nthat quarter.\r\n\r\n=Guerre= (_Fr._). War; warfare; art of war; dissension; strife. _En\r\nguerre_, at war; in action; ready for action; a piece of ordnance\r\nunlimbered, trunnions shifted, and everything made ready for firing.\r\n\r\n=Guerrillas= (Sp. _guérra_, “war”). The name given to armed bands, who\r\non occasion of foreign invasion or civil wars, carry on an irregular\r\nwarfare on their own account. The name was first applied in Spain to\r\nirregular soldiery. From 1808 to 1814 they were regularly organized\r\nagainst the French, and being favored by the character of the country\r\nwhich they fought in, were successful on many occasions. In our late\r\ncivil war many bands were organized in the Border States, and were a\r\ngreat annoyance to both armies. If guerrillas are taken captive in open\r\nwarfare, they should be treated according to the usual customs of war,\r\nunless they are known to have been guilty of acts not tolerated in\r\ncivilized warfare. In the Franco-German war, however, we find that the\r\nGermans refused to recognize as soldiers, or extend the privileges of\r\nwar, to the _francs-tireurs_, a body of French volunteer sharpshooters,\r\nwho, to a great extent, adopted this system of guerrilla warfare.\r\n\r\n=Guerrillero= (_Sp._). An irregular soldier; a member of a guerrilla\r\nband or party; a partisan.\r\n\r\n=Guet= (_Fr._). This term was particularly attached to those persons\r\nbelonging to the French body-guard, who did duty during the night. It\r\nalso signified rounds, or those duties of a soldier, or patroling party,\r\nwhich are prescribed for the security of a town, etc., and to prevent\r\nsurprises. It is also used in a military sense in conjunction with other\r\nwords; as _guet à pied_, foot patrol; _guet à cheval_, horse patrol,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Gueux= (_Fr._). “Beggars.” A name applied by the Count of Barlaimont in\r\n1566 to the confederated nobles and others of the Low Countries who\r\nopposed the tyrannies of Philip II. The malcontents at once adopted the\r\ntitle, and calling themselves _gueux_, for many years opposed the\r\nSpanish king by sea and land with varying success.\r\n\r\n=Guichet= (_Fr._). A small door or outlet, which is made in the gates of\r\nfortified towns. It is generally 4 feet high, and 2 broad, so that a man\r\nmust stoop to get through. In garrison towns the guichet was left open\r\nfor the space of one-quarter of an hour after the retreat, in order to\r\ngive the inhabitants time to enter.\r\n\r\n=Guides.= Generally the country people in the neighborhood where an army\r\nencamps. They give intelligence concerning the country, and the roads by\r\nwhich the enemy may approach. In time of war, particularly in the seat\r\nof it, the guides invariably accompany headquarters. Of late years it\r\nhas been customary to form them into regular corps with proper officers\r\nat their head.\r\n\r\n=Guides.= The name given to the non-commissioned officers, or other\r\nenlisted men, who take positions to mark the pivots, marches,\r\nformations, and alignments in modern discipline; the French call them\r\n_jaloneurs_, from _jalon_, a post.\r\n\r\n=Guides, Corps des= (_Fr._). The corps of guides. This body was\r\noriginally formed in France in 1756, and consisted of 1 captain, 1\r\nfirst lieutenant, 2 second lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1\r\nanspessade, and 20 privates, called _fusiliers-guides_. Another corps of\r\nguides was also formed in 1796. This corps now forms part of the\r\nimperial guard.\r\n\r\n=Guidon.= A small flag or streamer, as that carried by cavalry, which is\r\nbroad at one end, nearly pointed at the other, and usually of silk; or\r\nthat used to direct the movements of infantry, or to make signals at\r\nsea. In the U. S. service, each company of cavalry has a guidon.\r\n\r\n=Guidon.= One who carries a flag. Also, one of a community of guides\r\nestablished at Rome by Charlemagne to accompany pilgrims to the Holy\r\nLand.\r\n\r\n=Guienne=, or =Guyenne=. An old province in the southwest of France,\r\nlying to the north of Gascony. It was part of the dominions of Henry II.\r\nPhilip of France seized it in 1293, which led to war. It was alternately\r\nheld by England and France till 1453, when John Talbot, earl of\r\nShrewsbury, in vain attempted to take it from the latter.\r\n\r\n=Guilford Court-house= was situated about 5 miles northwest of\r\nGreensboro’, N. C. Here an engagement took place between the British\r\ntroops under Cornwallis, and the American forces, chiefly composed of\r\ninexperienced militia, under Gen. Greene, on March 15, 1781. The fight\r\nresulted in a partial victory for the royal troops, owing principally to\r\nthe disorganization and flight of the North Carolina militia. Gen.\r\nGreene, not wishing to risk the annihilation of his army, retreated to\r\nSpeedwell’s iron-works, 10 miles distant. Cornwallis, however, did not\r\nattempt to pursue him, but fell back himself to Cross Creek\r\n(Fayetteville).\r\n\r\n=Guillotine.= The instrument of decapitation introduced during the\r\nFrench revolution by the Convention, and named after its supposed\r\ninventor, J. I. Guillotin. It is composed of two upright posts, grooved\r\non the inside, and connected on the top by a cross-beam. In these\r\ngrooves a sharp iron blade, placed obliquely, descends by its own weight\r\non the neck of the victim, who is bound to a board laid below. The\r\ninvention of machines of this kind is ascribed to the Persians. In\r\nItaly, from the 13th century, it was the privilege of the nobles to be\r\nput to death by a machine of this kind, which was called _mannaia_.\r\nMachines of similar kind were used in Scotland and Holland for the\r\npurpose of decapitation.\r\n\r\n=Guinegate, Battle of.= Or more familiarly, the “Battle of the Spurs,”\r\nwas fought at Guinegate, not far from Tournai, in the province of\r\nHainault, August 16, 1513, between the English under Henry VIII.,\r\nassisted by a considerable body of troops headed by the emperor\r\nMaximilian, and the French under the Duc de Longueville. The latter were\r\ndefeated. The battle received its familiar designation from the\r\ncircumstance of the French knights having made better use of their\r\n_spurs_ than of their _swords_.\r\n\r\n=Guisarme=, or =Gisarme= (_Fr._). An offensive weapon formerly used in\r\nFrance; it was a two-edged axe mounted upon a long handle, and sometimes\r\ncalled _voulque_. There were three kinds; the _glaive gisarme_ had a\r\nsabre-blade with a spike, the _bill gisarme_ a blade like a\r\nhedging-bill, and the _hand gisarme_ was a kind of bill with a serrated\r\nback.\r\n\r\n=Guisarmiers= (_Fr._). Were French foot-soldiers (_piétons_) of the free\r\narchers, armed with the guisarme.\r\n\r\n=Gujerat=, or =Guzerat=. A walled town of the Punjab, on the right side\r\nof the Chenab, about 8 miles from the stream. It is a place of some\r\nmilitary importance, being on the great route between Attock and Lahore.\r\nHere on February 21, 1849, a Sikh army of 60,000 men was utterly\r\ndefeated by a British force decidedly inferior in point of numbers.\r\n\r\n=Gules.= The term by which the color red is known in heraldry. In\r\nengraving it is marked by perpendicular lines traced from the top of the\r\nshield to the bottom. It is supposed to indicate valor, magnanimity, and\r\nthe like, and is regarded as the most honorable heraldic color.\r\n\r\n=Gun.= In its most general sense, a gun is a machine, having the general\r\nshape of a hollow cylinder closed at one end, and used for the purpose\r\nof projecting heavy bodies to great distances by means of gunpowder.\r\nTechnically, it is a heavy cannon, distinguished by its great weight,\r\nlength, and absence of a chamber. It is used for throwing projectiles\r\nwith large charges of powder to long distances, with great accuracy and\r\npenetration. Guns came into use in the 14th century, and were first\r\nfired from supports, and in reality were artillery. Shortly after, they\r\ntook the form of a clumsy hand-gun, called an arquebuse, which was\r\nportable, but discharged from a forked rest. The next modification,\r\nwhich came into use about the end of the 14th century, was called the\r\nmatchlock. The piece was discharged by a lighted match brought down on\r\nthe powder-pan by the action of a trigger. This was superseded in 1517\r\nby the wheel-lock, the fire being produced by the action of a toothed\r\nwheel upon flint or iron pyrites. Almost contemporary with this was the\r\nsnaphance gun, in which sparks were generated by the concussion of flint\r\non the ribbed top of the powder-pan. About the middle of the 17th\r\ncentury the flint-lock began to be employed. This was a combination of\r\nthe two latter weapons, but much superior to either. It continued\r\nuniversally in use until the early part of the present century, when the\r\npercussion-lock was invented, which by 1840 (the time of its adoption by\r\nthe British government), had completely superseded it. As the lock\r\nimproved, and the rapidity of firing increased, the weight of the piece\r\ndiminished; the old tripod first used as a rest gave way to one stake,\r\nand finally, in the 18th century, was abandoned altogether. The weapon\r\nwas then the smooth-bore musket, which continued in use with various\r\nmodifications until the middle of the 19th century, when it was\r\npartially superseded by the rifle. (See SMALL-ARMS.) In their earlier\r\nstages cannon went by various names, as bombards, culverins, petronels,\r\nand later on were reduced to the three denominations, technically, of\r\nguns, howitzers, and mortars. For the two latter, see HOWITZER and\r\nMORTAR. Guns are subdivided in the U. S. service according to their use,\r\ninto field, siege, and sea-coast guns. The field-guns consist of two\r\nrifle pieces; the 3-inch rifle, adopted in 1861, and the 3¹⁄₂-inch\r\nrifle, adopted in 1870 (see ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF), and the Napoleon\r\ngun, a 12-pounder smooth-bore, adopted in 1857. (See NAPOLEON GUN.) The\r\nonly siege gun adopted by the United States is a 4¹⁄₂-inch rifle. The\r\n30-pounder Parrott, so extensively employed in our service for siege\r\npurposes, is not a regulation gun. The sea-coast guns consist of 13-,\r\n15-, and 20-inch smooth-bores, and 10- and 12-inch rifles. An 8-inch\r\nrifle has been constructed by converting the 10-inch smooth-bore\r\naccording to the Palliser or Parsons method. The 13-inch smooth-bore and\r\nthe 10- and 12-inch rifles are regarded as experimental guns. The guns\r\nprincipally in use for the land and sea forces of the United States are\r\nthose known as the Columbiad, or Rodman, Dahlgren, Gatling, Hotchkiss,\r\nNapoleon, Parrott. (For particular descriptions, see appropriate\r\nheadings.) In the British service they are the Armstrong, Palliser,\r\nWoolwich, or Fraser, and the Lancaster, Mackay, and Whitworth; the three\r\nlatter being now very little used. (See appropriate headings.) The only\r\nbreech-loader in general use in Europe is the Krupp, which is largely\r\nemployed for all purposes by Germany and Russia. See KRUPP GUN.\r\n\r\n=Gun, Curricle.= Is a small piece of ordnance, mounted upon a carriage\r\nof two wheels, and drawn by two horses. The artilleryman is seated on a\r\nbox, and the whole can be moved forward into action with astonishing\r\nrapidity. The tumbrils belonging to curricle guns carry 60 rounds of\r\nball cartridges. This gun is no longer in general use.\r\n\r\n=Gun Factories, Royal.= Are government establishments in England, at\r\nWoolwich, and Elswick, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, for the construction of\r\ngreat guns for the use of the British army and navy.\r\n\r\n=Gun-barrel.= The barrel or tube of a gun. Gun-barrels were formerly\r\nmade on the coiled principle, and this method is still largely followed\r\nin thin barrels like those of shot-guns. The superior kinds of shot-gun\r\nbarrels are known as _stub_, _stub-twist_, _wire-twist_, _laminated_,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_Stub-iron_ is made from horseshoe nails cleaned by tumbling and mixed\r\nwith a small proportion of steel scrap. It is then puddled and put\r\nthrough various processes, which end in the production of a flat bar\r\ncalled a _skelp_.\r\n\r\n_Twist_ is the term applied to _coiled barrels_. The iron or steel is\r\nmade into a ribbon, which is wound spirally around a mandrel and welded.\r\n\r\n_Stub-twist_ is stub-iron coiled.\r\n\r\n_Wire-twist_ is made by welding iron and steel bars together, or two\r\nqualities of iron, and drawing the compound bar into a ribbon, which is\r\ncoiled as before described. The term is specially applied to coiled\r\nbarrels made from small ribbons.\r\n\r\n_Damascus iron_ is made by twisting compound bars of steel and iron,\r\nwelding several of the twisted bars together and forming a ribbon from\r\nthe mass.\r\n\r\n_Laminated_ is the term applied to barrels made from compound bars.\r\n\r\nIn twist-barrels, the ribbon is several yards long, about half an inch\r\nwide, and thicker at the breech than at the muzzle end. It is heated to\r\nredness, wound on the mandrel, then removed and heated to the\r\nwelding-point slipped over a rod with a shoulder at the lower end. The\r\nrod is then dropped vertically several times on a block of metal, which\r\nwelds the spiral edges together. This is called _jumping_. The welding\r\nis completed by hammering.\r\n\r\nRifle-barrels and the cheaper kinds of shot-gun barrels are made\r\ndirectly from the _skelp_, which is passed between rollers, which first\r\nbend the plate longitudinally and afterwards convert it into a tube. The\r\ntube is then heated to a welding heat, a mandrel is pushed into it, and\r\nit is passed through the welding rolls, which weld the edges and at the\r\nsame time taper and lengthen the tube. The boring and turning are done\r\nin lathes.\r\n\r\n=Gun-carriage.= See CARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Gun-carriage, Barbette.= See BARBETTE CARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Gun-carriage, Field.= See FIELD-CARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Gun-carriage, Flank Casemate.= See FLANK CASEMATE CARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Gun-carriage, Mountain.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Gun-carriage, Prairie.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Gun-carriage, Sea-coast.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Gun-carriage, Siege.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Gun-cotton=, or =Pyroxyle=. Gun-cotton was discovered by Schönbein in\r\n1846, and was first made by treating ordinary cotton with a mixture of\r\nnitric and sulphuric acids. The product resembles ordinary cotton in\r\nappearance, but in color is slightly tinged with yellow, and is very\r\nmuch heavier. It explodes with great violence, but is unfit for most\r\nmilitary purposes on account of its liability to spontaneous explosion,\r\nits corroding residue, and the irregular character of its explosion.\r\nBaron von Lenk, of the Austrian service, however, succeeded to some\r\nextent in regulating the suddenness of the explosion by twisting it into\r\nropes, and weaving it into cloth, but it never came much into favor for\r\nmilitary purposes. As first made, the length of time necessary for its\r\nmanufacture was about two or three months, but Mr. Abel, of the British\r\nwar office, has by a series of experiments materially decreased the time\r\nnecessary for its manufacture, and greatly increased the safety and\r\ncertainty of the product. At Favesham the manufacture of a peculiar kind\r\nof gun-cotton, known as _tonite_, is conducted on a large scale. The\r\nprocess consists in intimately mixing the ordinary gun-cotton with about\r\nan equal weight of nitrate of baryta. This compound is then compressed\r\ninto candle-shaped cartridges, formed with a recess at one end for the\r\nreception of a fulminate of mercury detonator. It contrasts favorably\r\nwith soft, plastic dynamite from the fact of its being easily fastened\r\nto the safety-fuze. Among its advantages, said to be due to the use of\r\nthe nitrate, are that it contains a great amount of oxygen in a very\r\nsmall volume, and that it is very ready under the detonator, while its\r\ngreat density makes it slow to the influence of ordinary combustion. It\r\nis 30 per cent. stronger than ordinary gun-cotton, and takes up but\r\ntwo-thirds of its space, or the same space as dynamite. The cartridges\r\nare generally made water-proof. The projectile force of gun-cotton, when\r\nused with moderate charges, is equal to about twice its weight of the\r\nbest gunpowder. Its explosive force is in a high degree greater than\r\nthat of gunpowder, and in this respect its nature assimilates much more\r\nto the fulminates than to gunpowder. It evolves little or no smoke, as\r\nthe principal residue of its combustion is water and nitrous acid.\r\nRecently, by the mixture of nitre and cane-sugar its quickness in action\r\nhas been reduced so as to make it available for use in small-arms. The\r\nnitrous acid, however, will soon corrode the barrel if the piece is not\r\ncarefully wiped after firing. Other explosive substances analogous to\r\ngun-cotton may be prepared from many organic bodies of the cellulose\r\nkind, by immersing them in the same bath as for gun-cotton; among these\r\nmay be mentioned paper, tow, sawdust, calico, and wood fibre.\r\n\r\n=Gundermuk.= A village of Afghanistan, 28 miles west from Jellalabad.\r\nHere the remnant of the British force, consisting of 100 soldiers and\r\n300 camp-followers, were massacred in 1842, while retreating from Cabul\r\n(Cabool), only one man escaping.\r\n\r\n=Gun-fire.= The hour at which the morning or evening gun is fired.\r\n\r\n=Gun-lift.= The gun-lift recently devised by Col. Laidley, of the U. S.\r\nOrdnance Corps, is a most complete and rapid means for moving and\r\ndismounting heavy guns. In it the hydraulic jack is placed upon a stand\r\nover the gun, whereby the building-up of the crib-work of blocks, which\r\nserves as a base for the jack to stand on, is dispensed with, and the\r\nposition of the jack has not to be changed during the operation of\r\nraising or lowering a gun. The ordinary carpenter’s horse or trestle is\r\ntaken as the basis of the _hoisting_ apparatus. The cap of the trestle,\r\nhaving to sustain the weight of the gun suspended at a distance of more\r\nthan 2 feet from the points of support, is a large, strong, and heavy\r\npiece of timber, and the legs of the trestle have to be strongly braced.\r\nThe bolster, a strong piece of oak on top of the cap of the trestle, has\r\ntwo mortices cut in it, one for a hoisting-bar _to pass through_, and\r\nthe other for the fulcrum-post to _rest in_. The fulcrum-post has a\r\nrecess cut on the top to receive the end of a lever and keep it in\r\nplace. The lever has a mortice through which the hoisting-bar, already\r\nmentioned, passes; the latter is perforated with a series of holes\r\nthrough which a pin passes, by which the end of the lever, under which\r\nthe hydraulic jack works, can be fastened to the hoisting-bar. The\r\nhoisting-bar has a hook on its lower end to which the weight to be\r\nraised is fastened by means of a sling.\r\n\r\n=Gun-metal.= An alloy of nine parts of copper and one part of tin, used\r\nfor brass cannon, etc. (See BRONZE). The name is also given to certain\r\nstrong mixtures of cast iron.\r\n\r\n=Gunner.= A soldier employed to manage and discharge great guns; an\r\nartilleryman. In the U. S. service there is with each piece a gunner,\r\nwho gives all the executive commands in action. He is answerable that\r\nthe men at the piece perform their duties correctly.\r\n\r\n=Gunner’s Calipers.= Are made of sheet-brass, with steel points. The\r\ngraduations show diameters of guns, shot, etc.\r\n\r\n=Gunner’s Elevating Arc.= See ELEVATING ARC.\r\n\r\n=Gunner’s Level=, or =Gunner’s Perpendicular=. Is an instrument made of\r\nsheet-brass; the lower part is cut in the form of a crescent, the points\r\nof which are made of steel; a small spirit-level is fastened to one side\r\nof the plate, parallel to the line joining the points of the crescent,\r\nand a slider is fastened to the same side of the plate, perpendicular to\r\nthe axis of the piece. This instrument is used to mark the points of\r\nsight on pieces. By means of the bubble the feet or points of the\r\ncrescent are placed on a horizontal line on the base-ring or base-line,\r\nthe slider pushed down until the point rests on the base-ring or line,\r\nand its position marked with chalk.\r\n\r\n=Gunner’s Pincers.= Are made of iron with steel jaws, which have on the\r\nend of one a claw for drawing nails, etc.\r\n\r\n=Gunner’s Plummet.= A simple line and bob for pointing mortars.\r\n\r\n=Gunner’s Quadrant.= Is a graduated quarter of a circle of sheet-brass\r\nof 6 inches radius, attached to a brass rule 22 inches long. It has an\r\narm carrying a spirit-level at its middle and a vernier at its movable\r\nend. To get a required elevation, the vernier is fixed at the indicated\r\ndegree, the brass rule is then inserted in the bore parallel to the axis\r\nof the piece; the gun is then elevated or depressed until the level is\r\nhorizontal. There is also a graduated quadrant of wood, of 6 inches\r\nradius, attached to a rule 23.5 inches long. It has a plumb-line and\r\nbob, which are carried, when not in use, in a hole in the end of the\r\nrule, covered by a brass plate.\r\n\r\n=Gunnery.= The art of using fire-arms; but the term is commonly\r\nunderstood as being restricted to the use or application to the purposes\r\nof war of the larger pieces of ordnance, as cannon, mortars, and\r\nhowitzers. In its practical branch gunnery includes a just knowledge of\r\nthe construction of the several pieces of artillery, and of the\r\nstrength, tenacity, and resisting power of the materials of which they\r\nare formed; of the method of mounting them upon strong, efficient,\r\nwell-proportioned, and conveniently constructed carriages; of the\r\nproportions due to the strength of the powder and projectiles they\r\nshould carry; of the force and effect, and also of the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder; and, generally, of all such mechanical arrangements and\r\nappliances as may facilitate the movements and working of the guns,\r\netc., when prepared for action. But gunnery takes a yet far more\r\nextensive range; for it may be said to be based upon nearly every branch\r\nof the mathematical and physical sciences, and may be itself considered\r\nas a science requiring the most intricate combinations of human\r\nknowledge and mechanical ingenuity fully to comprehend and perfect. It\r\nparticularly requires an acquaintance with all experiments which may\r\nhave been made to ascertain the impetus of projection, the momentum of\r\nbodies in motion, and the range and time of flight of projectiles with\r\ngiven charges of gunpowder,--with the effect of the resistance of the\r\natmosphere upon projectiles propelled with different velocities, and the\r\nlaws of gravitation as affecting falling bodies; and with the various\r\ncauses, mechanical and otherwise, of the usual deflection of projectiles\r\nin their course, when fired from a gun. See PROJECTILES and VELOCITY.\r\n\r\n=Gunning.= The act of hunting or shooting game with a gun.\r\n\r\n=Gun-pendulum.= A contrivance for obtaining initial velocities of\r\nprojectiles. The gun is suspended from a frame-work with its axis\r\nhorizontal. The velocity of the shot is deduced from the arc described\r\nin the recoil. The apparatus is now nearly obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Gun-platform.= See PLATFORM.\r\n\r\n=Gunpowder.= A well-known explosive mixture, whose principal employment\r\nis in the discharge, for war or sport, of projectiles from fire-arms,\r\nand for mining purposes. The ingredients in gunpowder are saltpetre,\r\ncharcoal, and sulphur. Slightly different proportions are employed in\r\ndifferent countries. In the United States the proportions are 75 to 76\r\nsaltpetre, 14 to 15 charcoal, and 10 sulphur. Charcoal is the\r\ncombustible ingredient; saltpetre furnishes the oxygen necessary to\r\nsupport a rapid combustion and to change the whole mass into gas, and\r\nsulphur adds consistency to the mixture and intensity to the flame,\r\nbesides rendering the powder less liable to absorb moisture; increases\r\nthe volume of gas by preventing the formation of a solid potassium\r\ncarbonate, and by increasing the temperature.\r\n\r\nIn the _manufacture_ of ordinary powder, the operations usually employed\r\nare _pulverizing_ the ingredients, _incorporation_, _compression_,\r\n_granulation_, _glazing_, _drying_, and _dusting_.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients are _pulverized_ by placing each separately in barrels\r\nwhich contain bronze or zinc balls, and which are revolved rapidly for\r\nseveral hours.\r\n\r\n_Incorporation_ or thorough mixing is effected partially by the use of a\r\nrolling barrel, and completed in the _rolling-mill_. This consists of\r\ntwo cast-iron cylinders rolling round a horizontal axis in a circular\r\ntrough with a cast-iron bottom. The cylinders are very heavy, and give a\r\ngrinding motion, which is very effective in bringing about a thorough\r\nmixture of the three ingredients. A wooden scraper follows the rollers\r\nand keeps the composition in the middle of the trough. The charge in the\r\ntrough is moistened with 2 or 3 per cent. of water before the rollers\r\nare started. A little water is added from time to time as required. This\r\nis the most important operation in the manufacture of powder. The time\r\nrequired is about one hour for each 50 pounds of composition. When\r\nfinished the composition is called _mill-cake_.\r\n\r\n_Compressing._--This is next taken to the press-house, slightly\r\nmoistened and arranged between brass plates, and then subjected to\r\nhydraulic pressure of about 70 tons (English tons) per square foot. Each\r\nlayer is thus reduced to a hard cake.\r\n\r\n_Granulation._--The cake is broken up into grains by means of toothed\r\nrollers revolving in opposite directions, the cake being passed between\r\nthem. The different-sized grains are separated by sieves between the\r\ndifferent sets of rollers.\r\n\r\n_Glazing_ is effected by moistening the grains and revolving them in a\r\nrolling barrel.\r\n\r\n_Drying_ is done on sheets in a room heated to 140°-160°.\r\n\r\n_Dusting._--The dust is removed by revolving the powder in rolling\r\nbarrels covered with coarse canvas. The dust is caught by an outside\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThere are five kinds of grain powder used in the U. S. service,\r\ndistinguished as _mammoth_, _cannon_, _mortar_, _musket_, and _rifle_\r\npowder, all made in the same manner, of the same proportion of\r\nmaterials, and differing only in the size of the grain. Mammoth is\r\nemployed for the heaviest sea-coast guns; cannon for smaller sea-coast\r\nguns; mortar for mortars and field- and siege-pieces; musket for\r\nrifle-muskets; and rifle for pistols. In addition to the above we have\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n_Meal powder_, a fine dust containing the ingredients of ordinary\r\ngunpowder, but in which the relative proportions of these ingredients\r\nvary, according to the rate of burning desired, and the object for which\r\nthe powder is to be used. Used principally in pyrotechny, and in mortar\r\nfire to communicate the flame from the charge to the shell. Also\r\n“_German_” or “_American_” “_White Gunpowder_,” more powerful than\r\nordinary gunpowder, but more expensive; acts upon iron, and is very\r\nlittle used in gunnery.\r\n\r\n_Pebble powder_, an irregular large-grain powder, very similar to\r\nAmerican “Mammoth,” which preceded it, was made in England, 1865, by\r\nbreaking ordinary _press-cake_ with copper hammers.\r\n\r\n_Fossano powder_, made in Italy, 1871, granulated by hand, is a\r\nslow-burning powder, used in large guns, notably in the 100-ton guns,\r\none of which was recently burst, 1880, by a charge of 552 pounds of this\r\npowder. Lately the grains of this powder have been given a regular form.\r\n\r\nAmong _regular grain_ powders made _without molding_ are _cubical_, an\r\nEnglish powder, extensively used in all their large guns, the largest\r\nbeing 2 inches on the edge. This is made by passing the cake between\r\nfluted rollers, which cut it into strips, and then these strips endways\r\nbetween a second set of rollers.\r\n\r\n_Schaghticoke_, made at Hart’s Falls, N. Y., is a _cubical_ powder made\r\nvery much like the English,--the lines of fracture are, however, simply\r\nscratched on the cake (both sides), which is afterwards broken in the\r\nordinary way.\r\n\r\n_Molded Powder._--The ingredients are the same as those of ordinary\r\ngunpowder, but each grain is separately molded.\r\n\r\nGen. Rodman was the first to propose the manufacture of these powders in\r\nhis _perforated cake_, 1860; the object being to cause the powder to\r\nburn on an increasing surface, thus lessening the strain on the gun in\r\nthe first moments of combustion. His powder after a few experiments was\r\nallowed to fall into disuse in the United States, but the invention was\r\ncarried to Europe and developed with a smaller grain into _prismatic\r\npowder_, used in Europe, and especially in Germany and Russia, and\r\nparticularly adapted to breech-loading cannon; the grain is a hexagonal\r\nprism in form and contains six cylindrical orifices passing entirely\r\nthrough it parallel to the axis, and symmetrically arranged with respect\r\nto it. The cartridge is so made that the cylindrical orifices pass\r\nthrough the entire length.\r\n\r\n_Hexagonal Powder._--This is the powder principally used in the United\r\nStates; the grains have the shape which would be given by joining the\r\nlarger bases of two frustrums of equal six-sided pyramids, and vary in\r\nsize according to the piece in which the powder is to be used. This\r\npowder is believed in the United States to give the best results, and\r\ncan be adapted to cannon of any caliber.\r\n\r\n_History of Gunpowder._--The origin of gunpowder as an explosive, and\r\nits application to the projection of missiles of war, are lost in the\r\nmists of obscurity. Its use in Europe can be traced only to the middle\r\nor early part of the 14th century. It is believed by many that certain\r\nexperiments by Schwartz, a German monk, led to its introduction in war,\r\nbut the better theory seems to be that the knowledge was obtained from\r\nthe Saracens. It is probable that the invention arose in Central Asia in\r\nthe regions where saltpetre occurs as an effervescence of the soil. The\r\nChinese appropriated the discovery at a very early period, and fireworks\r\nwere common in that country when Europe was roamed by the primitive\r\nsavage. When Ghengis Khan invaded China, B.C. 1219, fire-arms of a\r\nprimitive form appear to have been used. Passages in old writers seem\r\nalso to show that when Alexander invaded India, 327 B.C., he encountered\r\ntribes that used similar weapons. The people of India doubtless obtained\r\ntheir knowledge from China. Wars and migrations of tribes gradually\r\ndisseminated a knowledge of gunpowder over Asia and Northern Africa. The\r\nuse of gunpowder is mentioned in Arabic writings in the 13th century.\r\nThe Moors used it in Spain in 1312. In 1331 the king of Granada employed\r\nit in sieges. It is said to have been used by the English in the battles\r\nof Crécy, 1316. The Venetians employed it in 1380 against the Genoese.\r\nFrom that time to the present fire-arms have gradually supplanted other\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after its introduction gunpowder was used in the form of\r\ndust or “meal powder.” Granulation was attempted to get rid of the\r\ndifficulties in handling the dust, but the grained form proved too\r\nstrong for the arms used, and “meal powder” continued in general use\r\ntill improvements in the weapons about the close of the 16th century\r\nadmitted of the other form. The granulation was at first very crude.\r\nThis was remedied in time by the introduction of machinery or\r\n_corning-mills_ in the manufacture. Though different-sized grains were\r\nat first used in large and small guns the principles involved were not\r\nstudied, and afterwards one uniform size--large musket powder--was\r\nemployed in all fire-arms. This step backwards may have been caused by\r\nthe impurity of the ingredients and bad manufacture, which made the\r\nlarge grains too weak. In the early part of the present century a\r\nclassification of grains was revived under the two general names of\r\n_musket_ and _cannon powder_. The invention of the _mercury densimeter_\r\nrendered practicable an accurate determination of the specific gravity\r\nof powder and its relation to quickness of burning, but the importance\r\nof size and form of grain was first appreciated by Gen. Rodman, who, in\r\n1859, began experiments which led at once to the introduction of\r\n_mammoth powder_ for large guns, and later to the invention of\r\n_perforated cake_. The introduction of the powerful ordnance now\r\nexisting in Europe has been rendered possible by improvements in this\r\ndirection based upon the principles first formulated by Rodman. The\r\nlatest idea on the subject is “compensating powder” (proposed by Lieut.\r\nC. A. L. Totten, of the 4th U. S. Artillery), a spherical grain of\r\ngunpowder inclosing a smaller sphere of gun-cotton. This powder remains\r\nto be made and experimented with, but it opens a field of research which\r\nmust lead to valuable results.\r\n\r\n=Gunpowder, Absolute Force of.= See ABSOLUTE FORCE OF GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Gunpowder Pile-driver.= A pile-driver operated by the explosive force\r\nof gunpowder. The hammer is arranged as usual to slide in vertical\r\nguides. It has a piston on its lower end, which enters a cylindrical\r\nhole in the pile-cap. In this hole the cartridge is placed, and is\r\nexploded through the compression of the air by the piston of the hammer,\r\nwhen the latter falls. The explosion drives down the pile and raises the\r\nhammer at the same blow. The powder ordinarily used is a mixture of\r\nchlorate of potash and bituminous coal.\r\n\r\n=Gunpowder Plot.= A conspiracy entered into by a few Roman Catholics to\r\ndestroy the king, lords, and commons on the meeting of Parliament on\r\nNovember 5, 1605. On the evening of the 4th, the famous Guy Fawkes, who\r\nwas to be the leader and agent of the conspirators, was detected under\r\nthe vaults of the House of Lords preparing the train for being fired the\r\nnext day; and on the morning of the 5th, a little after midnight, he was\r\narrested, examined, and tortured. He confessed his own guilt, but would\r\nnot discover his associates. However, all of them were either killed on\r\nbeing captured, or died on the scaffold, except one. The memory of this\r\nplot has survived in England, and the name of Guy Fawkes is detested.\r\n\r\n=Gunpowder-mill.= See MILL, GUNPOWDER-.\r\n\r\n=Gunreach.= The reach or distance to which a gun will shoot; gunshot.\r\n\r\n=Güns.= A town of Hungary, situated on the river of the same name, about\r\n57 miles south-southeast of Vienna.

This is used by military engineers.\r\n\r\n=Gunter’s Scales.= A wooden rule 2 feet long, on one side of which are\r\nmarked scales of equal parts, of chords, sines, tangents, rhombs, etc.,\r\nand on the other side, of logarithms of these various parts, by means of\r\nwhich many problems in surveying and navigation may be solved\r\nmechanically, by the aid of the dividers alone. This instrument is used\r\nby military engineers.\r\n\r\n=Gurges=, or =Gorges=. A charge in heraldry meant to represent a\r\nwhirlpool. It takes up the whole field, and when borne proper is azure\r\nand argent.\r\n\r\n=Gurries.= Mud forts made in India are so called.

Gurwal was\r\nsubdued by the Nepaulese about the year 1803, when Purdumin Shah, the\r\nrajah, at the head of 12,000 men, was defeated and slain at Gurudwara.\r\nThe country was conquered by the British in 1814, and partly restored to\r\nthe rajah’s son.\r\n\r\n=Gusset.= Was at first a piece of chain, and afterwards of plate-armor,\r\nintended as a protection to the vulnerable point where the defenses of\r\nthe arm and breast left a gap. In heraldry it is one of the abatements,\r\nor marks of disgrace for unknightly conduct. It is represented by a\r\nstraight line extending diagonally from the dexter or sinister chief\r\npoint one-third across the shield, and then descending perpendicularly\r\nto the base.\r\n\r\n=Guy.= A rope used to swing any weight, or to keep steady any heavy\r\nbody, and prevent it from swinging, while being hoisted or lowered.\r\n\r\n=Guzerat.= A state in India, founded by Mahmoud the Gaznevide, about\r\n1020; was conquered by Akbar in 1572; and became subject to the\r\nMahrattas, 1732 or 1752. At the battle of Guzerat, February 21, 1849,\r\nLord Gough totally defeated the Sikhs, and captured the city of Guzerat.\r\n\r\n=Gwalior.= Capital of the state of the same name, in Central India. Its\r\nnucleus is a completely isolated rock of about 300 feet in height,\r\nperpendicular, either naturally or artificially, on all sides; and as it\r\nmeasures 1¹⁄₂ miles by 800 yards, it can accommodate a garrison of\r\n15,000 men. It is thus virtually impregnable against any native force.\r\nThe spot is understood to have been occupied as a stronghold for more\r\nthan a thousand years.\r\n\r\n=Gyongyos.= A town of Hungary, 43 miles northeast from Pesth. The\r\nAustrians were defeated here by the Hungarians in 1849.\r\n\r\n=Gytheum=, or =Gythium= (now _Palæopolis_, near _Marathonisi_). An\r\nancient town on the east coast of Laconia, founded by the Achæans, near\r\nthe head of the Laconian Bay, southwest of the mouth of the river\r\nEurotas. It served as the harbor of Sparta, and was important in a\r\nmilitary point of view. In the Persian war, the Lacedæmonian fleet was\r\nstationed at Gytheum, and here the Athenians under Tolmides burned the\r\nLacedæmonian arsenal, 455 B.C. After the battle of Leuctra (370) it was\r\ntaken by Epaminondas. In 195 it was taken by Flamininus, and made\r\nindependent of Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, whereupon it joined the Achæan\r\nleague.\r\n\r\n=Gyves.= Fetters; old word for handcuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Haarlem=, or =Haerlem=. A city of the Netherlands, in the province of\r\nNorthern Holland, on the Spaarne. It is an ancient town, and was once\r\nthe residence of the counts of Holland; was taken by the Duke of Alva in\r\nJuly, 1573, after a siege of seven months. He violated the capitulation\r\nby butchering half the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n=Habeas Corpus.= A writ of habeas corpus is an order in writing, signed\r\nby the judge who grants the same, sealed with the seal of the court of\r\nwhich he is a judge, and issued in the name of a sovereign power where\r\nit is granted, by such a court or a judge thereof having lawful\r\nauthority to issue the same, directed to any one having a person in his\r\ncustody or under his restraint, commanding him to produce such person at\r\na certain time and place, and to state the reason why he is held in\r\ncustody or under restraint.\r\n\r\n=Habergeon.= A short coat of mail, consisting of a jacket without\r\nsleeves. In early times the habergeon was composed of chain-mail; but in\r\nthe 14th century a habergeon of plate-armor was worn over the hauberk.\r\n\r\n=Habiliments of War.= In ancient statutes signify armor, harness,\r\nutensils, etc., without which it is supposed there can be no ability to\r\nmaintain a war.\r\n\r\n=Habsburg=, or =Hapsburg, House of=. An ancient sovereign family of\r\nAustria, which derives its name from the castle of Habsburg, in\r\nSwitzerland. The first member of the family who acquired great celebrity\r\nwas Rudolph of Habsburg, born in 1218, and elected emperor in 1273. He\r\nobtained Austria and other provinces by conquest, and founded the\r\ndynasty which now reigns over the Austrian empire, and which, since\r\n1736, has been styled the house of Habsburg-Lorraine.\r\n\r\n=Hachée= (_Fr._).

The edges, both at top and bottom, were fenced with iron, to\r\nenable them to meet the broadsword and sabre, and to prevent them from\r\nrotting when planted on the ground. The convex part was further covered\r\nover with iron plates, to resist the impression of hard blows, and to\r\nwithstand the violent concussion of stones, etc. The _hastati_ commonly\r\nformed the first line in the order of battle; the _principes_ were\r\nplaced in the second line; whilst the oldest and best legionaries,\r\nclassed under the name of _triarii_, constituted a reserve or third\r\nline.\r\n\r\n=Hastings.= A town of England, in the county of Surrey, 33 miles\r\nnortheast from Brighton, and one of the Cinque Ports.

At\r\nthe lower end of the scale is a brass bulb filled with lead. The\r\n_slider_ which marks the divisions on the scale is of thin brass, and is\r\nclamped at any desired division on the scale by means of a screw. The\r\nscale passes through a slit in a piece of steel, with which it is\r\nconnected by a screw, forming a pivot on which the scale can vibrate\r\nlaterally. This piece of steel terminates in pivots, by means of which\r\nthe pendulum is supported on the _seat_ attached to the gun, and is at\r\nliberty to vibrate in the direction of the axis of the piece. The _seat_\r\nis of metal, and is fastened to the base of the breech by screws, so\r\nthat the centres of the steel pivots of vibration shall be at a distance\r\nfrom the axis of the piece equal to the radius of the base-ring.\r\n\r\n=Hausse-col= (_Fr._).

This\r\nchannel is strongly fortified; the city is also surrounded with\r\ndefensive works, all furnished with heavy artillery. Havana has been\r\nfrequently attacked; it was captured in 1536 by a French pirate, and\r\npartially destroyed; it was subsequently taken, at different times, by\r\nthe English, by the French, and by the buccaneers. In 1762 the British\r\ntook possession of it, but restored it in 1763.\r\n\r\n=Havelock.= A light cloth covering for the head and neck, used by\r\nsoldiers as a protection from sunstroke.

It was discovered by\r\nChristopher Columbus in 1495. Until 1665 Spain kept possession of the\r\nisland; but in that year the French obtained a footing, and retained\r\ntheir position for upwards of a century and a quarter. In 1800 the\r\nindependence of Hayti was proclaimed by the negro population, and the\r\nFrench finally quitted the island in 1803. Since that time various\r\nrevolutions have occurred, and a kind of military elective government\r\nhas prevailed under different leaders. In 1849 the former French portion\r\nof the island was proclaimed an empire under its president, Solouque,\r\nwho took the title of Faustin I. The sable emperor was, however, deposed\r\nin 1858, and a republic was again proclaimed.\r\n\r\n=Hazaree.= An Indian term signifying the commander of gun-men.

From that time they were held by various native\r\nchieftains in vassalage to the Scottish monarch, until they came under\r\nthe sway of one powerful chief, who assumed the title of “Lord of the\r\nIsles” in 1346, and effected entire independence of Scotland. In 1748\r\nall hereditary jurisdictions were abolished, and for the first time,\r\nunder a just and powerful government, the peace of the islands was\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n=Hebron.= A place in Palestine, about 20 miles a little west of south\r\nfrom Jerusalem, and one of the oldest existing cities in the world. The\r\nMaccabees recovered it from the Edomites, who had taken it after the\r\nCaptivity. It was burned by an officer of Vespasian just before the\r\ndestruction of Jerusalem. It was taken by the Arabs in 637, and by the\r\nCrusaders about 1100; and ever since 1187 has been in the hands of its\r\npresent masters, the Mohammedans.\r\n\r\n=Hedge.= To surround for defense; to fortify; to guard; to protect; to\r\nhem.

Near this\r\nplace a naval battle was fought between the English and the Dutch in\r\n1653, in which Van Tromp was killed. It was taken by the English under\r\nSir Ralph Abercrombie in 1799; was afterwards retaken by Brewe, and\r\nsubsequently rendered a first-class fortress by Napoleon I. It is\r\nconnected with Amsterdam by the famous Helder Canal.\r\n\r\n=Helena, Saint.= An island in the Atlantic Ocean, which presents to the\r\nsea, throughout its whole circuit, an immense wall of perpendicular\r\nrock, from 600 to 1200 feet high. This island was discovered by the\r\nPortuguese in 1502, and belonged to the Dutch from 1610 to 1650, when it\r\nfell into the hands of the British. It is chiefly famous for having been\r\nthe place in which Napoleon I. was confined by the allied powers after\r\nhis final overthrow at the battle of Waterloo. Here he lived at\r\nLongwood, from November, 1815, till his death in 1821. His remains also\r\nlay here till 1840, when, by the permission of the English government,\r\nthey were conveyed to France.\r\n\r\n=Helepolis.= In the ancient art of war, a machine for battering down the\r\nwalls of a place besieged.

ILUNUM). A royal town of Spain, in the province of\r\nMurcia. This town was sacked by the French under Montbrun, and was the\r\npoint where Joseph and Soult united with Suchet after Marmont’s rout at\r\nSalamanca.\r\n\r\n=Helmet.= A piece of defensive armor or covering for the head. Among the\r\nearly nations of antiquity the helmet forms a prominent feature in all\r\nmilitary costume, and is often of very great utility in distinguishing\r\nthe age or country of the wearer. The Egyptian kings had them of brass,\r\nwhile the soldiers wore linen ones thickly padded. The crests of the\r\nroyal Egyptian helmet were the heads of the lion, bull, or dragon. The\r\nMilyans had helmets of skins; those of a fox formed the early Thracian\r\nhelmet; and this ancient fashion of the heroic ages appears in the\r\n_galerus_ of the Roman light troops. The Phrygian bonnet was a\r\nskull-cap, with a bent peak projecting in front, like the bust of a\r\nbird, with an arched neck and head. It is certainly the most ancient\r\nform of helmet. Strabo says the ancient Persians, and probably their\r\noriental neighbors, wore modern turbans; in war, a cap cut in the form\r\nof a cylinder or tower. This Asiatic fashion extended itself widely. The\r\nhelmet of the Grecian soldier was usually made of brass, and sometimes\r\nof the skins of beasts, with the hair still on; and to render them more\r\nterrible, the teeth were often placed in a grinning manner. The crest\r\nwas made of horse-hair or feathers, and was curiously ornamented. In the\r\nearly period of the Greeks, helmets had been composed of the skins of\r\nquadrupeds, of which none were more common than the dog. After the time\r\nof Alexander the Great, common soldiers had only small crests;\r\nchieftains, plumes or two crests. The helmet of the Romans was a\r\nhead-piece of brass or iron, which left the face uncovered, and\r\ndescended behind as far as the shoulders. Upon the top was the crest, in\r\nadorning which the soldiers took great pride. The usual ornament was\r\nhorse-hair or feathers of divers colors; but the helmets of the officers\r\nwere sometimes very splendid, and adorned with gold and silver. Helmets\r\noccur with cheek-pieces and movable visors. Singular helmets, with\r\naigrettes, plumes, wings, horns, double crests, double-cheek pieces\r\n(some of which are seen on the Hamilton vases), and others, with\r\nfantastical additions and overloaded crests, are either barbarian, or\r\nsubsequent to the removal of the seat of empire to Constantinople. The\r\nGauls wore helmets of brass, with monstrous appendages for ostentation,\r\nas the shapes of birds, beasts, etc. In the Middle Ages the knights of\r\nEurope were distinguished by helmets adorned with the figure of a crown,\r\nor of some animal. The king wore a helmet of gold, or gilt; his\r\nattendants of silver; the nobility of steel; and the lower orders of\r\niron. In European armies helmets are worn by the horse-guards and heavy\r\ncavalry. In the United States, helmets made of felt and adorned with\r\nhorse-hair plumes are worn by light artillery and cavalry troops.\r\n\r\n=Helmet-shaped.= Shaped like a helmet; galeate.\r\n\r\n=Helmless.= Destitute of a helmet; without a helm.\r\n\r\n=Helos.= In ancient geography, the name of several towns, so called from\r\ntheir position among or near _fens_. The most important town of this\r\nname was in Laconia, at the mouth of the Eurotas, in a plain close to\r\nthe sea. In the Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus Helos was taken, and\r\nits inhabitants carried off to Sparta and reduced to slavery. Their name\r\nis said to have been applied by their masters generally to all the\r\nbondsmen or helots that fell into their power.\r\n\r\n=Helots.= The lowest class of the population of ancient Sparta, which\r\nwas formed of serfs or slaves. They are supposed to have formed the\r\noriginal population of the country, and to have been reduced to bondage\r\nby their Dorian conquerors. In war, they served as light troops, each\r\nfree-born Spartan who bore heavy armor being accompanied to battle by a\r\nnumber of them, sometimes as many as seven. In order to keep their\r\nnumbers within bounds the Spartans organized secret companies, who went\r\nabroad over the country armed with daggers, and both by night and day\r\nassassinated the unfortunate Helots, selecting as their special victims\r\nthe strongest and most vigorous of the oppressed race.\r\n\r\n=Helsingfors.= A fortified town, and seaport in Finland, on a peninsula\r\nin the Gulf of Finland. It has a good harbor, and is defended by the\r\nalmost impregnable citadel and fortifications of Sweaborg, which stand\r\non a number of rocky islands at the entrance of the harbor. This town\r\nwas burnt in 1741, during the war between Sweden and Russia. In 1855,\r\nSweaborg was bombarded for two days by the allied English and French\r\nfleet, when some damage was done to the interior defenses of the place.\r\n\r\n=Helvetian Republic.= Switzerland having been conquered by the French in\r\n1797, a republic was established in 1798 with this title.\r\n\r\n=Helvetii.= A Celtic people inhabiting, according to Cæsar, the region\r\nbetween the mountains of Jura on the west, the Rhone on the south, and\r\nthe Rhine on the east and north, the region corresponding pretty closely\r\nwith modern Switzerland. The great and fatal event in their history is\r\ntheir attempted irruption into and conquest of Southern Gaul, in which\r\nthey were repulsed by Cæsar with frightful slaughter in 58 B.C., and\r\ncompelled to return to their own country, where they became subjects to\r\nthe Romans. In the commotions which followed the death of Nero, the\r\nHelvetians met with another terrible catastrophe. Remaining faithful to\r\nGalba, they were fallen upon by Cacina, a general of Vitellius, who gave\r\nthem up to the rapacity of his legions, and from this time they scarcely\r\nappear in history as a distinct people.\r\n\r\n=Helvoetsluys.= A fortified town of Holland, on the south shore of the\r\nisland of Voorn, 17 miles southwest from Rotterdam. At this place the\r\nPrince of Orange, afterwards William III., embarked for England in 1688.\r\nIt was taken by the French in 1798, and evacuated by them in 1813.\r\n\r\n=Hem In.= To surround an enemy, whether on land or sea.\r\n\r\n=Hemerodromi.= In Grecian antiquity, were, as the name imports, runners\r\nor couriers, who could keep running all day. In a country like Greece,\r\nwhere the roads were few and bad, the hemerodromi were indispensable for\r\nthe rapid diffusion of important news. Every Greek state made a point of\r\ntraining a number of these men who could travel great distances in an\r\nincredibly short space of time, and at every dangerous crisis they were\r\nstationed on commanding points to observe and report at headquarters\r\nwhat it was necessary for the authorities to know. In the service of the\r\nPersian kings, these men were called _angoroi_, and the service\r\n_angereion_. Among the Romans these couriers were known as _cursores_;\r\nthey traveled sometimes on foot, sometimes on horseback. It is a\r\nwell-known fact that running footmen attended the Duke of Marlborough\r\nin his wars in the Low Countries and in Germany. In the Byzantine\r\nempire they were employed as sentinels at the gates of towns. When the\r\ngates were opened they were obliged to patrol round the outskirts of the\r\ntown during the whole day. Frequently, indeed, they advanced\r\nconsiderably into the country, in order to discover whether any hostile\r\nbody of men was approaching in order to surprise the garrison.\r\n\r\n=Henery Isle.= A small island lying due south from Bombay. In 1790 it\r\nbelonged to Ragojee Angria, and was a principal rendezvous of pirate\r\nvessels, though within sight of Bombay. Near it is another small island\r\nnamed Kenery, which is also fortified, and of considerable strength. It\r\nwas taken possession of and fortified by Sevajee in 1679. In 1790 it\r\nbelonged to the Peshwa, and was also the haunt of pirates.\r\n\r\n=Heneti.= An ancient people in Paphlagonia, dwelling on the river\r\nParthenius; fought on the side of Priam against the Greeks, but had\r\ndisappeared before the historical times. They were regarded by many\r\nancient writers as the ancestors of the Veneti in Italy.\r\n\r\n=Hengestdown.= In Cornwall, England. Here Egbert is said to have\r\ndefeated the Danes and West Britons in 835.\r\n\r\n=Hennebon.= A town of France, in the department of Morbihan, on the\r\nBlavet. It was formerly a very strong place, and was successfully\r\ndefended by the Countess of Montfort, when it was besieged by Charles de\r\nBlois, in 1342.\r\n\r\n=Henry Rifle.= See MAGAZINE GUNS.\r\n\r\n=Hephestion=, or =Hephæstion=. A Macedonian courtier and commander, the\r\nson of Amyntor of Pella; became a favorite of Alexander the Great, whom\r\nhe followed in the invasion of Persia and India.

A New Zealand fort, or space surrounded with\r\nstout palisades.\r\n\r\n=Heptarchy.= A government of seven; said to have been established by the\r\nAnglo-Saxons in England before the reign of Egbert (800-836 A.D.). Under\r\nEgbert, Wessex rose to be supreme, and virtually swallowed up the\r\nothers. The common idea is that these seven kingdoms were\r\ncontemporaneous; but all that can be safely asserted is, that England in\r\nthis time was peopled by various tribes, whose leading occupation was\r\nwar; and that sometimes one was conquered, sometimes another. At no time\r\nwas there a counterpoise of power among seven of them, so that they\r\ncould be said to have a separate, much less an independent existence.\r\nStill, seven names do survive, so as to use the term Heptarchy.\r\n\r\n=Heraclea.= In ancient geography, a large and important city of Magna\r\nGræcia. It was situated in Lucania, between the small streams Siris and\r\nAciris, a little way inland from the shore of the Tarentine Gulf. It\r\nseems to have been colonized about 432 B.C. In the wars with Pyrrhus it\r\nsided with Tarentum against Rome; but it afterwards abandoned its parent\r\nstate and became an ally of the Roman people. It suffered severely\r\nduring the Social war, but still retained a considerable measure of\r\nimportance and prosperity. It afterwards fell into decay.\r\n\r\n=Heraclea.= Surnamed Minoa; in ancient geography, a Greek city of\r\nSicily, at the mouth of the Halycus (now the _Platani_), 20 miles\r\nnorthwest from Agrigentum. The surname seems to have been originally the\r\nname of the town, which is first mentioned in history as a colony of\r\nSelinus. About the end of the 6th century it was recolonized by the\r\nSpartans, and had attained to great prosperity and power, when it was\r\ndestroyed by the jealousy of the Carthaginians. After remaining in their\r\npower for about 200 years it fell into the hands of Agathocles, and then\r\nof Pyrrhus. It was next recovered by the Carthaginians, who retained it\r\nto the end of the first Punic war, when the whole of Sicily was made\r\nover to the Romans. In the second Punic war it reverted to the\r\nCarthaginian sway, but was finally attached to the Roman empire by\r\nMarcellus, shortly after the fall of Syracuse. After the servile war,\r\nHeraclea was repeopled by the Romans, and continued to flourish till the\r\ntime of Cicero. It afterwards sunk into decay, and at this day its very\r\nruins can hardly be traced.\r\n\r\n=Heracleidæ.= This term means, in its widest sense, all the descendants\r\nof Heracles (Hercules), of whatever time, and in whatever district of\r\nGreece; but is specially applied to those adventurers who, founding\r\ntheir claims on their supposed descent from the great hero (to whom Zeus\r\nhad promised a portion of the land), joined the Dorians in the conquest\r\nof the Peloponnesus. There were five different expeditions, the last and\r\ngreatest occurring eighty years after the Trojan war. The story of the\r\nreturn of the Heracleidæ touches on the historical period, and though\r\nthere is much of fable and tradition, yet there seems to be also a large\r\nsubstratum of truth in the records of the Greek historians.\r\n\r\n=Heracleum.= A place near Gindarus, in the Syrian province of\r\nCyrrhestice, where Ventidius, the legate of M. Antony, gained his great\r\nvictory over the Parthians under Pacorus in 38 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Herald.= An officer in the European courts, whose duty consists in the\r\nregulation of armorial bearings, the marshaling of processions, and the\r\nsuperintendence of pubic ceremonies. In the Middle Ages heralds were\r\nhighly honored, and enjoyed important privileges; their functions also\r\nincluded the bearing of messages between royal personages, and\r\nregistering all chivalric exercises; the computation of the slain after\r\nbattle; and the recording of the valiant acts of the falling or\r\nsurviving combatants. The office of herald is probably as old as the\r\norigin of coat-armor. In England the principal heraldic officers are\r\ndesignated kings-of-arms, or kings-at-arms, and the novitiates or\r\nlearners are styled pursuivants. There are in England three\r\nkings-at-arms, named by their offices Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy;\r\nsix heralds,--Somerset, Chester, Windsor, Richmond, Lancaster, and York;\r\nand four pursuivants, called Rouge Dragon, Portcullis, Blue Mantle, and\r\nRouge Croix. In Scotland the principal heraldic officer is the Lyon\r\nking-at-arms; and there are six heralds,--Snowdoun, Albany, Ross,\r\nRothesay, Marchmont, and Ilay; and five pursuivants,--Unicorn, Carrick,\r\nKintyre, Ormond, and Bute. Ireland has one king-at-arms, Ulster; two\r\nheralds, Cork and Dublin; and two pursuivants, of whom the senior bears\r\nthe title of Athlone, and the other is called the pursuivant of St.\r\nPatrick.\r\n\r\n=Heraldry.= The science of armorial bearings. The practice of wearing\r\ndevices on the shields of knights was originated in the middle of the\r\n12th century, and ever since families bear on their shield the arms of\r\ntheir progenitors, which at first had been adopted either arbitrarily or\r\nsuggested by some striking episode in the life of the bearer.\r\n\r\n=Herald’s College=, or =College of Arms=. A collegiate body, founded by\r\nRichard III. in 1483, consisting of the heraldic officers of England,\r\nwho were assigned a habitation in the parish of Allhallows-the-Less, in\r\nLondon. Various charters confirmed the privileges of the College of\r\nArms, and it was re-incorporated by Philip and Mary in 1554. The\r\npresidency of the college is vested in the earl marshal, an office\r\nhereditary in the family of Howard, duke of Norfolk. He nominates the\r\nthree kings-of-arms, six heralds, and four pursuivants, who are the\r\nmembers of the collegiate chapter. The members of the college have\r\nsalaries, but derive their principal income from fees charged for\r\nassistance in tracing pedigrees and titles, and for the granting and\r\nregistration of arms. In Scotland the corresponding functions belong to\r\nthe Lyon court. See LYON KING-AT-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Herat.= A city of Afghanistan, the capital of an independent state,\r\nsituated in a plain near the Hury River, 360 miles west from Cabul. This\r\nplace has often been ravaged by various conquerors, who have claimed and\r\nwon the empire of Asia. In 1220 it was taken by Genghis Khan, and in\r\n1398 by Tamerlane. It was subsequently united to Persia; but the Afghans\r\ntook possession of it in 1715. Nadir Shah retook it in 1737, and Ahmed\r\nKhan, an Afghan, and one of Nadir’s generals, added it to Afghanistan,\r\nafter the assassination of Nadir Shah, in 1747. Mohammed Shah marched\r\nagainst Herat in 1836, and, after a long siege, the Persians were forced\r\nto withdraw. In 1855 the Persians again made an attempt to get\r\npossession of Herat; but, after a short war with England, desisted.\r\n\r\n=Hercotectonique= (_Fr._). A term in fortification signifying that\r\nbranch of military architecture which specifically points out the best\r\nmeans of defense and the surest method of providing stores. This word is\r\nderived from the Greek.\r\n\r\n=Herculean.= Very great, difficult, or dangerous; such as it would\r\nrequire the strength or courage of Hercules to encounter or accomplish.\r\n\r\n=Hercules, Pillars of.= The name given by the ancients to the two rocks\r\nforming the entrance to the Mediterranean at the Strait of Gibraltar.\r\nTheir erection was ascribed by the Greeks to Hercules, on the occasion\r\nof his journey to the kingdom of Geryon.\r\n\r\n=Herefare.= An old term from the Saxon, signifying the same as warfare.\r\n\r\n=Hereford.= The chief town of Herefordshire, England, on the Wye. During\r\nthe Saxon era, the Welsh inflicted considerable damage on this city; it\r\nalso suffered greatly in the wars of the barons, and under the\r\nPlantagenets. During the civil war it held loyally to the cause of the\r\nking, and was one of the last places that yielded to the Parliament.\r\n\r\n=Heregeld.= A term derived from the Saxon, signifying a tax which was\r\nformerly levied for maintaining an army.\r\n\r\n=Herera.= In Aragon. Here Don Carlos of Spain, in his struggle for his\r\nhereditary right to the throne, at the head of 12,000 men, encountered\r\nand defeated (August 24, 1837) Gen.

The\r\nmost noteworthy (called _Santa Hermandad_, or Holy Brotherhood) was\r\nestablished in the middle of the 13th century in Aragon, and in Castile\r\nabout thirty years later; while in 1295, 35 cities of Castile and Leon\r\nformed a joint confederacy, and entered into a compact, by which they\r\npledged themselves to take summary vengeance on every noble who had\r\neither robbed or injured a member of their association, and refused to\r\nmake just atonement for the wrong; or upon any one who should attempt,\r\neven by the order of the king, to levy an unjust tax. Isabella of\r\nCastile, seeing the beneficial effects which an extension of the\r\ninstitution was capable of producing, obtained the sanction of the\r\nCortes for its thorough reorganization and extension over the whole\r\nkingdom in 1496. In 1498, the objects of the Hermandad having been\r\nobtained, and public order established on a firm basis, the brotherhood\r\nwas disorganized and reduced to an ordinary police, such as it has\r\nexisted, with various modifications of form, to the present century.\r\n\r\n=Herminia Gens.= A very ancient patrician house at Rome, which appears\r\nin the first Etruscan war with the republic, 506 B.C.; vanishes from\r\nhistory in 448.\r\n\r\n=Hermunduri.= One of the most powerful nations of Germany; belonged to\r\nthe Suevic race. They were for a long time the allies of the Romans; but\r\nalong with the other German tribes they assisted the Marcomanni in the\r\ngreat war against the Romans in the reign of M. Aurelius. After this\r\ntime they are rarely mentioned as a separate people, but are included\r\nunder the general name of Suevi.\r\n\r\n=Hernici.= A people in Latium; belonged to the Sabine race. They\r\ninhabited the mountains of the Apennines between the Lake Fucinus and\r\nthe river Trerus. They were a brave and warlike people, and long offered\r\na formidable resistance to the Romans.

It was joined to Thuringia till about 1263, when\r\nHenry I. became landgrave of Hesse. The most remarkable of his\r\nsuccessors was Philip, who signed the Augsburg Confession in 1530, and\r\nthe League of Smalcald in 1531. At his death Hesse was divided in\r\nHesse-Cassel and Hesse-Darmstadt, and in 1803 the former became an\r\nelectorate, and the latter a grand duchy. Hesse-Cassel was incorporated\r\nwith Prussia in 1866, and Hesse-Darmstadt became a part of the North\r\nGerman Confederation in 1867, and as such it took part in the\r\nFranco-Prussian war in 1870.\r\n\r\n=Hessians.= Troops belonging to Hesse-Cassel, Prussia.

This authority of the superior\r\nshould be greater or less according to rank and position, and be\r\nproportioned to his responsibilities. Orders should be executed without\r\nhesitation; but responsibilities should be confined to him who gives\r\norders in virtue of the superior authority with which he is invested; to\r\nhim who takes the initiative in an order; to him who does not execute an\r\norder that he has received; and to him who usurps a command, or\r\ncontinues illegally to exercise its functions. The military hierarchy is\r\ndetermined and consecrated within its sphere of action by grades of rank\r\ncreated by military laws, by other laws regulating the exercise of rank,\r\nby military insignia, by military honors, and by the military oath.\r\n\r\n=High Treason.= Treason against the state, being the highest civil\r\noffense.

They seem to have been subdued in the early part of the 3d century\r\nB.C. They appear as an independent people in the second Punic year.\r\nRevolting from their old conquerors, they joined the Carthaginian\r\ninvaders, and, though they were unable to recapture their stronghold of\r\nBeneventum, they remained faithful to Hannibal till the defeat at the\r\nMetaurus restored the empire of Italy to his opponents. In the year of\r\nthat event the Hirpini made their peace with their old masters by\r\nbetraying into their hands the garrisons of their allies. From this time\r\ntill the outbreak of the Social war, the Hirpini seem to have continued\r\nsteadfast in their allegiance. On that occasion, however, they set the\r\nexample of revolt to the allies, and might have become formidable\r\nenemies, had not the rapid successes of Sulla induced them to repair\r\ntheir error by complete submission. After the close of the war the\r\nHirpini do not appear in history as an independent people.\r\n\r\n=Hispalis.= See SEVILLE.\r\n\r\n=Histiæa.= An ancient city of Eubœa.

In 1848 this duchy, with\r\nSchleswig, attempted to gain its independence; but, after some severe\r\nfighting, it was reduced to obedience in 1850. In 1863 the struggle was\r\nrenewed; and, under the pretext of separating this duchy, together with\r\nthat of Schleswig, from Denmark, and of annexing it to the Germanic\r\nConfederation, an allied Austrian and Prussian army invaded the country\r\nand drove out the Danes, after a short but desperate struggle. It was\r\nannexed to Prussia after the Prussian-Austrian war (1866), and now forms\r\na part of the North German Confederation.\r\n\r\n=Holsters.= Leathern cases for pistols, affixed to the pommel of the\r\nsaddle. They are frequently covered with wool or fur, to prevent injury\r\nto the rider in the event of his being thrown forward upon them. They\r\nare also worn on a belt.\r\n\r\n=Holstered.= Bearing holsters; as, a holstered steed.\r\n\r\n=Holy Alliance.= A league formed after the fall of Napoleon by the\r\nsovereigns of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, nominally to regulate the\r\nrelations of the states of Christendom by the principles of Christian\r\ncharity, but really to preserve the power and influence of the existing\r\ndynasties. Most of the other European rulers acceded to it, and the\r\ntreaty was made public February 2, 1816. A special article of the treaty\r\nexcluded forever the members of the Bonaparte family from any European\r\nthrone. But after the secession of England and France the alliance\r\nbecame practically obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Holy Ghost, Order of the.= A Roman Catholic order consisting of\r\nhospital knights, which was founded in the 12th century, and ceased to\r\nexist as a knightly order in 1700.\r\n\r\n=Holy Island=, or =Lindisfarne=. An island off the coast of\r\nNorthumberland, 8 miles southeast from Berwick-on-Tweed, and is\r\nconnected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus or neck of sand. On the\r\nsouth of the island lies the town, and near it are the ruins of an old\r\nabbey which the Danes destroyed in 900.\r\n\r\n=Holy League.= A name applied to several combinations of sovereigns or\r\nprinces of Europe for warlike or defensive purposes. The first was\r\norganized in 1510 by the pope, Venice and Spain against Louis XII. of\r\nFrance. But the most important of all was _the holy league_, so called\r\nby way of eminence, which was organized at Perrone in 1576, and lasted\r\ntill 1593, to prevent the accession of Henry IV. of France to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n=Holy Sepulchre, Knights of the.= An order of knighthood instituted\r\nprobably by Pope Alexander VI., for the guardianship of the Holy\r\nSepulchre, and the relief and protection of pilgrims. The pope was\r\noriginally the grand master, but he subsequently ceded his rights to the\r\nGuardian Father of the Holy Sepulchre. The knights must, by the rules of\r\nthe order, be all of noble descent; they were bound to hear mass daily,\r\nto fight, to live, and to die for the Christian faith, etc. In return\r\nfor these duties, the knights had the most unusual and extraordinary\r\nprivileges conferred on them; they were exempt from taxation, could\r\nmarry, and yet possess church property, legitimize bastards, cut down\r\nand bury the bodies of criminals who had been hanged. On the recapture\r\nof Jerusalem by the Turks, the knights retired to Italy, and settled at\r\nPerugia. After a temporary union with the Hospitallers, the order was\r\nreconstructed in 1814 both in France and in Poland, and is still in\r\nexistence within a very small circle of knights elected by the Guardian\r\nFather from the most respectable pilgrims who come to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n=Holy Wars.= See CRUSADE.\r\n\r\n=Homelden.= In Northumberland, England, where the Scots, headed by the\r\nEarl of Douglas, were defeated by the Percies (among them Hotspur),\r\nSeptember 14, 1402.\r\n\r\n=Home-service.= Consists in military operations and arrangements for the\r\nimmediate defense of our own country, should it be threatened by\r\ninvasion, or by domestic broils or insurrections.\r\n\r\n=Homme d’Armes= (_Fr._). A military phrase among the French, signifying\r\na gentleman or cavalier who belonged to one of the old companies, was\r\narmed _cap-a-pie_, and always fought on horseback. In ancient times,\r\nevery man of this description was accompanied by two horsemen\r\nindependent of his servants. One of the mounted attendants was armed\r\nwith a cross-bow, and the other with a common bow or battle-axe; so that\r\n100 _hommes d’armes_ composed a body of 300 horse. It was a species of\r\ncavalry which existed from the reign of Louis XI. until the reign of\r\nHenry II.\r\n\r\n=Honduras.= A republican state of the confederation of Central America;\r\nbeing bounded north by the Caribbean Sea and Bay of Honduras, southeast\r\nby the Mosquito Territory and Nicaragua, south by San Salvador and the\r\nBay of Conchagua, on the Pacific, and west by Guatemala.\r\n\r\n=Honeycomb.= A defect in guns resembling the cells of wax in which the\r\nbee stores her honey. These flaws in the metal arise either from\r\ncareless or imperfect casting, or from long disuse of a gun and exposure\r\nto damp. A honeycombed gun is liable to burst in firing.\r\n\r\n=Hong-Kong.= An island off the coast of China; was taken by Capt.\r\nElliott, August 23, 1839, and ceded to Great Britain, January 20, 1841.\r\n\r\n=Honi Soit Qui Mal y Pense= (_Fr._). See GARTER, ORDER OF THE.\r\n\r\n=Honor.= In a general acceptation may be properly called a consciousness\r\nof worth and virtue in the individual, and a lively desire to preserve\r\nthe reputation of virtue. As a term, it is variously used in military\r\nlife. As a quality of the mind, it cannot be too much encouraged or too\r\nmuch cultivated among military men of all ranks and descriptions. The\r\npossession of it is a guarantee for good conduct, a bond of fidelity,\r\nand a certain barrier against military corruption. Men are excited to\r\ndeeds of valor and enterprise by a sense of honor, who would otherwise\r\nremain inactive, or only perform the mere drudgery of service. This term\r\nmay likewise be considered as esteem, reputation, the glory which is\r\nattached by mankind to talents and virtues.\r\n\r\n=Honor, Affair of.= A transaction connected with a duel, or a challenge\r\nto fight a duel; a duel itself.\r\n\r\n=Honor, Court of.= Is a species of board of inquiry, which has not only\r\nthe power of ascertaining the degree of guilt which may be attached to\r\nmisconduct, but of pronouncing an opinion which may or may not entail\r\nignominy upon the guilty persons. See COURT OF HONOR.\r\n\r\n=Honor, Debt of.= An obligation which among honorable men, especially\r\nofficers, is more binding than those engagements or contracts that are\r\nguaranteed by law. The reason is manifest.\r\n\r\n=Honor, Point of.= A nice discrimination in matters affecting one’s\r\nhonor. A delicacy of feeling, which is generally acquired by education,\r\nand strengthened by intercourse with men of strict integrity and good\r\nconduct. It is likewise very frequently the offspring of peculiar\r\nhabits, received notions, and established etiquettes; also, a minute\r\ndistinction; a punctilio.\r\n\r\n=Honor, Signatures upon.= Are instruments, such as declarations of\r\nofficers on vouchers for allowances, pay, etc., that are guaranteed by\r\nthe names of individuals, without oath.\r\n\r\n=Honor, Word of.= A promise or engagement that is made or entered into\r\nby word of mouth, the breach of which entails disgrace upon the\r\nviolator. _To die upon the bed of honor_, is a term particularly applied\r\nto military men, who die in battle fighting in their country’s cause.\r\n\r\n=Honors of War.= A compliment granted on capitulation to a garrison\r\nwhich has made a gallant defense. The exact nature of the honors\r\naccorded have varied in different ages and on different occasions.\r\nOrdinarily they are as follows: The garrison marches out through the gap\r\nin the breach, if there is one, with arms and personal baggage. The\r\ndrums beat, the colors fly, officers carry their swords drawn, and the\r\nmen their bayonets fixed. A certain number of guns--ordinarily\r\ntwo--accompany the force, and formerly the gunners carried lighted\r\nmatches. On reaching the glacis the garrison--unless it is one of the\r\nstipulations that it is to join the main army--forms up and grounds\r\narms, only the officers retaining their swords, and is marched off under\r\nescort.\r\n\r\n=Honvéd.= The name given in Hungary under the earlier kings to the\r\nnational champions. With the disappearance of these, the word too\r\ndisappeared; but in the summer of 1848 it was revived, and applied first\r\nto those Hungarian volunteers dispatched to the south against the\r\nServians, and subsequently, when the war with Austria really commenced,\r\nto the whole patriotic army. Still, in common parlance, the term honvéd\r\nis used only with reference to the Hungarian infantry.\r\n\r\n=Hood= (Sp. _tapadera_). A leather cover for the stirrup of a saddle.\r\n\r\n=Hooghly.= A town of Bengal, and the capital of a district of the same\r\nname, situated on the west hank of the Hooghly River, 27 miles north\r\nfrom Calcutta. This place is supposed to have been founded by the\r\nPortuguese about 1538, and after their expulsion in 1632 by the Mogul\r\ntroops, it became the imperial port of the Mogul empire. In 1757 it was\r\ntaken by the British; it was retaken shortly after by Surajah Dowlah,\r\nbut ultimately fell, after a few months, into the hands of the British\r\nunder Lord Clive.\r\n\r\n=Hooks.= Pieces of bent iron fixed to the transom plates of a\r\nfield-carriage are so called. They serve to fix the bricoles or ropes\r\nfor drawing it occasionally backwards or forwards.\r\n\r\n=Hookum.= An Indian word, signifying order or command.\r\n\r\n=Hookummaumeh.= In India, signifies a letter of instructions, or the\r\npaper that contains orders.\r\n\r\n=Hoplital= (Fr. _hoplites_). Foot-soldiers among the Greeks, who bore\r\nheavy armor, and engaged with broad shields and long spears. These took\r\nprecedence of all other foot-soldiers.\r\n\r\n=Horde.= A wandering troop or gang; especially a clan or tribe of a\r\nnomadic people possessing no fixed habitations, but migrating from place\r\nto place for the sake of pasturage, plunder, or the like cause.\r\n\r\n=Hordearium.= The money which the Romans gave their cavalry for the\r\nsustenance of their horses.\r\n\r\n=Horion= (_Fr._). A term which formerly signified a helmet, and which in\r\nthe vulgar acceptation of it now, among the French, means a blow upon\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n=Horizon= (Gr. _orizo_, I bound or terminate). In astronomy and\r\ngeography, is the plane of the great circle of the sphere, dividing the\r\nvisible from the invisible hemisphere. The horizon is either _sensible_\r\nor _rational_. The sensible horizon is a plane which is a tangent to the\r\nearth’s surface at the place of the spectator, extended on all sides\r\ntill it is bounded by the sky; the rational horizon is a plane parallel\r\nto the former, but passing through the centre of the earth. Both the\r\nsensible and rational horizon are relative terms, and change with every\r\nchange of the spectator’s position on the surface of the earth; in all\r\ncases they are perpendicular to the direction of gravity.\r\n\r\n=Horizontal Fire.= The fire of guns and howitzers under low angles of\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n=Horizontal Plane.= That which is parallel to the horizon; a plane\r\ntangent to the surface of the earth, at the place.\r\n\r\n=Horizontal Range.= In gunnery, is the distance to which a piece of\r\nordnance will project a ball on a horizontal plane. Supposing no\r\nresistance from the atmosphere, the greatest range would be when the\r\npiece is elevated at an angle of 45°; and in all other positions the\r\nhorizontal range would be as the sine of twice the angle of elevation.\r\nIn a resisting medium the maximum horizontal range requires the\r\nelevation to be less than 45°. It is found by experience that, with the\r\nordinary velocity, a cannon-shot ranges the farthest when the elevation\r\nof the piece is about 30°.\r\n\r\n=Hornwork.= A kind of work in advance of a fortification, akin to a\r\ncrown-work, but consisting of only one curtain and two half-bastions.\r\n\r\n=Hors de Combat.= A French military phrase, signifying that an\r\nindividual or body of men are so completely beaten as not to be able to\r\nmaintain the field of battle. _Mettre hors de combat_, to drive your\r\nopponent before you; to press him so closely that he cannot make a stand\r\nagainst you; to put him out of the lists of contests. To be wounded or\r\nincapable of individual effort, is also being _hors de combat_.\r\n\r\n=Horse.= A military term for a body of cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Horse Artillery.= Is that portion of the artillery which usually serves\r\nwith cavalry, and in which the cannoneers are mounted on horseback, to\r\nenable them to conform with the rapid movements of that arm of the\r\nservice. Possessing, from their lighter construction and mounted\r\ndetachments, much greater locomotive powers than other field-batteries,\r\nthey are especially adapted for following the rapid evolutions of\r\ncavalry, for sudden attacks upon particular points, and for supporting\r\nthe advance, or covering the retreat of an army.\r\n\r\n=Horse, Associated.= A body of cavalry so called in the days of\r\nCromwell. At the famous battle of Naseby (June 14, 1645), which decided\r\nthe fate of Charles I., the Associated Horse were posted in the rear of\r\nthe right wing of the Republican army, and formed a part of the reserve.\r\nCromwell commanded the cavalry on the right of the whole, and the\r\nAssociated Horse were under his immediate orders.\r\n\r\n=Horse, Cavalry and Artillery.= Horses generally make in a minute, at\r\nordinary pace, 120 steps, and they cover 110 yards; at a trot, 180\r\nsteps, covering 220 yards; and at a gallop, 100 steps or strides,\r\ncovering 352 yards; from which it would appear that the length of the\r\nstride at the ordinary pace is about 0.917 yard, and that the velocity\r\ncorresponds to about 1.74 yards per second; and at a trot the stride is\r\nabout 1.28 yards and the speed about 3.68 yards per second; and at a\r\ngallop the stride is about 3.52 yards, with a speed of about 5.87 yards\r\nper second. A good horse carrying a weight of 225 pounds, can travel,\r\nwithout over-exertion, 25 miles in a day of from seven to eight hours;\r\nhis speed in this case would be between 1.75 and 1.53 yards per second.\r\nThe weight of an average-sized horse is about from 900 to 1350 pounds.\r\nThe age of the horse is determined by the appearance of the teeth, which\r\nvary according to the number of years the animal has attained, and may\r\nbe easily understood by a slight attention to the subject; the number,\r\nquality, and size of the teeth indicating the respective ages. The lower\r\nfront teeth or nippers are those by which the age of a colt is usually\r\ndetermined. At two years old these teeth will be complete; that is to\r\nsay, the colt will have a full set, six in number, of milch-teeth.\r\nBetween two and three years old the two centre teeth are displaced, and\r\ntwo permanent teeth succeed them, easily distinguished from colt’s teeth\r\nby being broader, larger, and having a dark cavity in the centre of the\r\nupper surface. At three years old the colt will have in the lower jaw\r\ntwo permanent and four colt’s teeth; between the third and fourth year\r\nthe next pair of incisor teeth will be shed, and permanent teeth succeed\r\nthem. At four years old there will be four permanent teeth in the\r\ncentre, and two colt’s teeth at each corner of the lower jaw. Between\r\nthe fourth and fifth year the last remaining colt’s nipper, or corner\r\ntooth, will be cast; and, if a horse or gelding, the tushes, four in\r\nnumber, will show themselves, two in the upper and two in the lower jaw.\r\nAt five years old the horse will have a full or complete set of\r\npermanent teeth in the upper and lower jaws; for the same change that\r\ntakes place in the lower is developed in the upper jaw also. The colt at\r\nthis age takes the name of horse, and is supposed to be equal to all the\r\nlaborious duties expected from him. Although we can no longer judge of\r\nhis age by the shifting or shedding of his teeth, we can form a\r\ntolerably correct conclusion from other appearances of them. At six\r\nyears old the dark oval-shaped mark in the centre of the two front\r\nnippers, usually called by horsemen “the bean,” will be nearly or quite\r\nworn away; the tushes higher and stronger, and the cavities of the\r\ninterior part of the tooth more filled; the two corner nippers level\r\nwith the others, and equally developed. At seven years old the marks in\r\nthe second pair of nippers are filled up, and the tushes become more\r\nround externally and internally. At eight years old the marks in the\r\ncorner nippers are worn out, and the tushes more round and blunt. From\r\nthis age the animal is said to be, in horse phraseology, “past\r\nknowledge”; and although a tolerably correct opinion may be formed for\r\nmany years to come by the appearance of the upper jaw and other\r\nprognostics, still they cannot be implicitly relied on. It often occurs\r\nat a much earlier period that the best judges of age are deceived by the\r\nuntimely structural alteration of the teeth, produced by mechanical or\r\npathological causes, such as crib-biting, biting the rack or manger,\r\neating hard food, etc. Horses used for cavalry in the United States are\r\nselected with regard to climate, the American horse east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and what is known as the Mexican or _bronco_, west of the\r\nRocky Mountains; the power of endurance of the latter being much more\r\nthan that of the former, they are better adapted to the rugged, arid\r\ncountry that an American cavalry soldier has to travel over on the\r\nwestern frontier. For artillery large, strong American horses are used.\r\nA horse occupies a space in the ranks of a front of 40 inches, a depth\r\nof 10 feet; in a stall, from 3¹⁄₂ to 4¹⁄₂ feet front; at picket 3 feet\r\nby 9. Cavalry horses usually charge at the rate of 24 miles per hour, or\r\none mile in 2¹⁄₂ minutes. See PACK AND DRAUGHT HORSES.\r\n\r\n=Horse Guards.= The name was applied to a large public office in\r\nWhitehall, London, appropriated to the departments under the\r\ngeneral-commanding-in-chief, and guarded by a squadron of Horse Guards.\r\nIn 1871 the headquarters were removed to Pall Mall.\r\n\r\n=Horse Guards, Royal= (Oxford Blues). Is the third heavy cavalry\r\nregiment of the Household Brigade (English). The regiment was raised in\r\n1661 from the remnants of the disbanded army of the late Commonwealth.\r\nIt took part in Marlborough’s campaigns; served under the Duke of\r\nWellington in the Peninsula and at Waterloo, and has always been\r\nconsidered one of the finest heavy cavalry corps in the world.\r\n\r\n=Horseman.= A mounted soldier.\r\n\r\n=Horsemanship.= The act or art of riding, and of training and managing\r\nhorses; manege.\r\n\r\n=Horse-power.= A measure for the quantity of work of which an engine or\r\nmotor is capable in a given time. It is 33,000 foot-pounds in one\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n=Horse-shoe.= In fortification, is a small round or oval work, with a\r\nparapet; generally made in a ditch, or marsh.\r\n\r\n=Horse-tail.= A Turkish standard. Commanders are distinguished by the\r\nnumber of horse-tails carried before them, or planted in front of their\r\ntents. Thus, the sultan has seven, the grand vizier five, and the pashas\r\nthree, two, or one.\r\n\r\n=Hospital.= A place appointed for the sick and wounded men, provided\r\nwith physicians, surgeons, nurses, servants, medicines, beds, etc.\r\n\r\n=Hospital, Field.= Is the staff and apparatus for the surgical treatment\r\nof the wounded in the field, and the locality assigned for the resort of\r\nthe latter to obtain it. In the United States there is a hospital at\r\nevery military post, under the superintendence of the army medical\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n=Hospital, Regimental.= In Great Britain, each regiment has a hospital\r\nfor the reception of the sick belonging to it. This hospital is under\r\nthe immediate care of the regimental surgeon, who is subordinate to the\r\ngeneral medical board.\r\n\r\n=Hospital Steward.= In the U. S. service, is a non-commissioned officer\r\nof the general staff, whose duty consists in making up prescriptions,\r\nadministering medicines, and in a general supervision of the sick, under\r\nthe instructions of an army medical officer.\r\n\r\n=Hospital Tent.= A large tent used for hospital purposes. See TENT.\r\n\r\n=Hospitallers.= A celebrated brotherhood founded at various times and in\r\ndifferent countries for the care of the sick in hospitals. The vow to\r\ndevote themselves to this work of mercy is, in all these brotherhoods,\r\nsuperadded to the ordinary vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience,\r\nwhich are common to all the religious orders in the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. One of the earliest recorded instances of a hospital served by\r\nsuch a brotherhood is that of Constance, in the 13th century. See SAINT\r\nJOHN OF JERUSALEM and TEUTONIC KNIGHTS.\r\n\r\n=Hospodar.= A title borne by the governors of Wallachia and Moldavia,\r\nunder the Turks. Although nominated by the porte, they possessed\r\nabsolute power within their own dominions. By the treaty of Adrianople\r\nin 1829, the principalities were placed under Russian protection, and\r\nfrom that time till the treaty of Paris in 1856, the hospodars were\r\nvirtually the nominees of Russia.\r\n\r\n=Host.= An army; any large body of men assembled together in arms.\r\n\r\n=Hostages.= Are persons given in pledge for the performance of\r\nconditions. When a town capitulates, victors and vanquished usually give\r\ninto the custody, one of the other, several officers, as pledges that\r\neach party will duly carry out the terms stipulated. When the terms are\r\nfulfilled, the hostages are exchanged; but if the terms be evaded, the\r\nopposite side holds the right to put to death, or otherwise punish, the\r\nhostages in its possession; of late years the practice is going out of\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n=Hostile.= Belonging to an enemy; appropriate to an enemy; showing\r\nill-will and malevolence, or a desire to thwart and injure; occupied by\r\nan enemy or a hostile people; inimical; unfriendly; as, a hostile force,\r\nhostile country, etc.\r\n\r\n=Hostilities.= A rupture between the natives of different countries. The\r\nfirst hostile act that is committed by either party is considered the\r\ncommencement of hostilities. Between nations, the first act of hostility\r\npresupposes a declaration of war.\r\n\r\n=Hosting.= An encounter; a battle. A muster or review. This term is now\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n=Hot Shot.= Shot made red-hot for the purpose of setting fire to\r\nbuildings, shipping, etc. The charges for hot shot are from one-fourth\r\nto one-sixth the weight of the shot. With small velocities, the shot\r\nsplits and splinters the wood, so as to render it favorable for burning.\r\nWith great velocity the ball sinks into the wood, is deprived of air by\r\nthe closing of the hole, and chars instead of burning the surrounding\r\nwood. It should not penetrate deeper than 10 or 12 inches. Red-hot\r\nballs do not set fire to the wood until some time after their\r\npenetration. They retain sufficient heat to ignite wood after having\r\nmade several ricochets upon water. The wads for hot shot should be made\r\nof clay or hay, the latter to be well soaked in water, and before being\r\nused, the water pressed out of it. With proper precautions in loading,\r\nthe ball may be permitted to cool in the gun without igniting the\r\ncharge. The piece, however, should be fired with as little delay as\r\npossible, as the vapor would diminish the strength of the powder. They\r\nare heated by means of furnaces erected for the purpose, which hold\r\nsixty or more shot. The shot being placed, and the furnace cold, it\r\nrequires one hour and fifteen minutes to heat them to a red heat; but\r\nafter the furnace is once heated, a 24-pounder shot is brought to a red\r\nheat in twenty-five minutes. Red-hot shot is not in general use.\r\n\r\n=Hotchkiss Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Hotchkiss Revolving Cannon.= Consists of five barrels grouped around a\r\ncommon axis; they are revolved in front of a solid breech-block, which\r\nhas in one part an opening to introduce the cartridges, and another\r\nopening through which to extract the empty shells. The cartridges are\r\nfired after being revolved and while motionless in front of the solid\r\nportion of the breech. In exterior aspect it resembles the Gatling gun,\r\nbut is entirely different in its interior mechanism. See MACHINE GUNS.\r\n\r\n=Hotchkiss Rifle.= See MAGAZINE GUNS.\r\n\r\n=Hôtel des Invalides= (_Fr._). A spacious building which was erected by\r\nLouis XIV. in Paris, upon the river Seine, as a public monument of his\r\ncharity and munificence. All disabled, infirm, and wounded officers and\r\nsoldiers were received, lodged, and subsisted during the remainder of\r\ntheir lives within its walls.\r\n\r\n=Hotte= (_Fr._). A sort of hand-basket, which is often made use of in\r\nthe construction of batteries and other works, and serves to carry earth\r\nfrom one place to another. Hence the word _hod_, a well-known machine\r\nfor carrying bricks.\r\n\r\n=Hougines= (_Fr._). Parts of ancient armor covering the thighs, legs,\r\nand arms.\r\n\r\n=Hounds.= Are pieces of wood used in the construction of limbers for\r\ngun-carriages to connect the splinter-bar with the axle.\r\n\r\n=Hours of Sitting= (Courts-martial). See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 94.\r\n\r\n=Household Troops.= See GUARDS.\r\n\r\n=Housing.= Cover or cloth over or under a horse’s saddle used for\r\ncleanliness, or as an ornamental or military appendage; a saddle-cloth;\r\na horse-cloth.\r\n\r\n=Howitzer= (derived by Grimm and Littré from the Bohemian _haufnice_,\r\n“catapult”). A short, light cannon, having a chamber intended to throw\r\nlarge projectiles with comparatively small charges. A howitzer is of\r\nlarger caliber than a gun of like weight; is mounted in a similar\r\nmanner, and is used for shorter ranges. It is said to have been first\r\nintroduced by the Dutch in the early part of the 17th century, and soon\r\nafterward came into almost general use. The Russians in 1777 introduced\r\nthe _licorne_, an improved howitzer. Howitzers project larger shells\r\nthan guns with which they are associated; are well adapted for ricochet\r\nfire, the destruction of field-works, breaking down palisades, and\r\nsetting fire to buildings; and the projectiles used are shells,\r\nspherical-case, canister, grape, and carcasses. Howitzers, except for\r\nsiege and mountain service, are no longer manufactured in the United\r\nStates, as our present guns are equally suitable for shell-firing in\r\nfield or garrison service. The ones now in use in the U. S. service are\r\n8-inch and 24-pounder mountain howitzers. The former is used for siege\r\npurposes, and for the defense of ditches in fortifications. The\r\n24-pounder flank defense howitzer, now out of use, was formerly employed\r\nfor this purpose. The 8-inch howitzer has, strictly speaking, no\r\nchamber; the bore is, however, terminated by a semi-ellipsoid, the axis\r\nbeing 6 inches in length. This piece weighs 2600 pounds, and the shell\r\n(not filled) 45 pounds. The mountain howitzer (12-pounder) is a small,\r\nlight, bronze piece about 3 feet long, weighing 220 pounds, capable of\r\nbeing easily removed from its carriage, and transported upon the back of\r\na mule. The shell weighs, when strapped and charged, 9.35 pounds, and\r\nthe maximum range of the piece is about 1000 yards. There are two\r\ndistinct kinds of carriage used with it, one similar to the carriage of\r\nthe ordinary field-piece, but smaller and lighter, the other having four\r\nwheels and called the prairie carriage. This piece has been extensively\r\nemployed in our numerous Indian wars upon the plains and mountains of\r\nthe West, and has done good service.\r\n\r\n=Hualpais=, or =Hualapais Indians=. A tribe of aborigines who are\r\nlocated on the Colorado River near the Mojaves.\r\n\r\n=Hub.= The hilt of a weapon; as, to drive a dagger into a body up to the\r\nhub.\r\n\r\n=Hubbardton.= A village of Rutland Co., Vt., about 46 miles\r\nsouth-southwest of Montpelier. Here an American force of three regiments\r\nof Warner, Francis, and Hale, numbering about 1300, were defeated by the\r\nBritish under Col. Fraser, July 7, 1777.\r\n\r\n=Hubert, St., Order of.= The highest Bavarian order of knighthood,\r\nfounded in 1444.\r\n\r\n=Hubertsberg.= A village of Saxony, 24 miles east from Leipsic. The\r\ntreaty of peace, by which the Seven Years’ War was ended, was signed in\r\nthe royal castle of this place in 1763.\r\n\r\n=Hue and Cry.= In Great Britain, an official gazette, which serves to\r\nadvertise deserters from her majesty’s service.\r\n\r\n=Huguenots.= A term (derived by some from the German _Eidgenossen_,\r\n“confederates,” by others from Hugues, a Genevese Calvinist) applied to\r\nthe Reformed party in France, followers of Calvin. They took up arms\r\nagainst their persecutors in 1561. After a delusive edict of toleration,\r\na great number were massacred at Vassy, March 1, 1562, when the civil\r\nwars began, which lasted with some intermission till the edict of Nantes\r\nin 1598 (revoked in 1685). The massacre of St. Bartholomew’s day, August\r\n24, 1572, occurred during a truce.\r\n\r\n=Huissier d’Armes= (_Fr._). Tipstaff; an officer formerly so called in\r\nFrance, who was attached to the royal household. They were at first\r\ndistinguished by the name of _sergens d’armes_, or sergeants-at-arms.\r\nSome were directed to bear the mace before the king during the day, and\r\nobtained on that account the appellation of _huissiers d’armes_; in\r\nlater times they were called the _huissiers_, or tipstaffs of the king’s\r\nchamber. Others kept watch in the king’s bed-chamber during the night,\r\nand were sworn to expose their lives for the safety of his person,\r\nwhence they obtained the name of _archers de la garde_, which term was\r\nchanged to _gardes du corps_, or body-guards.\r\n\r\n=Hulan.= See UHLAN.\r\n\r\n=Hull=, or =Kingston-upon-Hull=. A seaport town of England, in\r\nYorkshire, situated on the great inlet of the Humber, at the point where\r\nit is entered by the river Hull. It is a very ancient town; during the\r\ncivil war it declared for the Parliament, and sustained two severe\r\nsieges by the royalists.\r\n\r\n=Humaitá.= A strong post on the river Paraguay, defended by a battery of\r\n300 cannon, and believed to be impregnable by Lopez, the president of\r\nParaguay; was forced by the Brazilian ironclads February 17, 1868. On\r\nthe 19th, Caxias, the Brazilian general, stormed a work to the north of\r\nHumaitá, and captured many stores.\r\n\r\n=Hungary.= A portion of the Austrian empire. It was a part of the\r\nancient Pannonia and Dacia; was subjected to the Romans about 106, and\r\nretained by them till the 3d century, when it was seized by the Goths,\r\nwho were expelled about 376 by the Huns, under Attila. After his death\r\nin 453, the Gepidæ, and in 500 the Lombards held the country. It was\r\nacquired by the Avars about 568, and retained by them till their\r\ndestruction by Charlemagne in 799. About 890 the country was settled by\r\na Scythian tribe, named Vingours, or Ungri (whence the German name\r\n_Ungarn_), and the Magyars of Finnish origin. The progress of the\r\nMagyars westward was checked by their defeat by the emperor Henry the\r\nFowler, 934. After various changes of rulers it came permanently under\r\nthe dominion of Austria in 1526. A revolution took place in Hungary in\r\n1848 under the leadership of Kossuth.\r\n\r\n=Huns.= The name of a considerable nation of antiquity, which from time\r\nto time made incursions on the Roman dominions, and which eventually,\r\nunder Attila, the most renowned of its leaders, brought in the 5th\r\ncentury the Eastern and Western empires to the verge of destruction.\r\nThey were originally of Asiatic origin, and probably akin to the\r\nScythians and Turks. In the latter part of the 4th century they settled\r\nalong the Danube, in the territory abandoned by the Goths, and\r\nsubsequently they pressed onward towards further conquests. In the 5th\r\ncentury they had acquired considerable power, but after Attila’s death\r\nit was broken. Many of them afterwards took service with the Romans;\r\nothers joined the invaders from the north and east that were attacking\r\nthe moribund Roman empire.\r\n\r\n=Hunters, Death-.= Followers of an army, who, after an engagement, look\r\nfor dead bodies in order to strip them.\r\n\r\n=Hurdices.= Ramparts, scaffolds, fortifications, etc.\r\n\r\n=Hurdles.= In fortification, twigs of willow or osiers, interwoven close\r\ntogether, and sustained by long stakes. They are made in the figure of a\r\nparallelogram, in length 5 or 6 feet, in breadth 3 or 3¹⁄₂. The closer\r\nthey are wattled together the better. They serve to revet, or render\r\nbatteries firm, or to consolidate the passage over muddy ditches; or to\r\ncover traverses and lodgments for the defense of the workmen against the\r\nfireworks. Hurdles are constructed in nearly the same manner as gabions,\r\nexcepting that the pickets are placed in a straight line instead of a\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n=Hurkaru.= A messenger; one who brings intelligence; a scout.\r\n\r\n=Hurl.= To send whirling or whizzing through the air; to throw with\r\nviolence; to drive with great force; as, to hurl a lance, etc.\r\n\r\n=Huron Indians= (also called _Wyandots_). A tribe of aborigines now\r\nalmost extinct, who were settled in Canada and in a part of the United\r\nStates. They fought against the United States in the war of 1812-15.\r\n\r\n=Hurst.= A charge in heraldry representing a small group of trees,\r\ngenerally borne upon a mount in base.\r\n\r\n=Hurter=, or =Heurtoir=. A square beam placed at the foot of a parapet\r\nwhere there is an embrasure to prevent the wheels of the gun, when the\r\nlatter is run up, from injuring the interior slope. A short fascine or\r\nmilitary fagot is sometimes substituted for a beam. A hurter is placed\r\non the front part of a siege platform, under the wheels. The motion of\r\ngun-carriages is checked, front and rear, by pieces of wood or iron\r\nbolted to the top rails called _hurters_ and _counter-hurters_.\r\n\r\n=Hussar.= A name given to the national cavalry of Hungary and Croatia.\r\nThey were first raised in 1458, and received their name either from the\r\nmethod in which they were called out, or from the Tartar _uswar_, which\r\nsignifies cavalry. In the armies of modern Europe hussars are light\r\nhorse, and differ from light dragoons only in some peculiarities of\r\ndress and equipments.\r\n\r\n=Hussites.= Is the name of the followers of Huss. Immediately after his\r\nmartyrdom they arose in Bohemia, and took a frightful revenge on the\r\npriests, monks, and prelates of the Roman Catholic Church. Wenceslaus\r\nsucceeded, however, in appeasing the storm by granting them religious\r\nfreedom. But when the king died in 1419, and the pope issued an order\r\nfor the conversion of the Hussites by force, a civil war began. They\r\nassembled under the leadership of John Ziska, on Mount Tabor, captured\r\nPrague, pillaged and burnt the monasteries, and defeated at Deutchbrod\r\nin 1422, and in several other minor encounters, the troops of Sigismund,\r\nthe German emperor and heir of Wenceslaus. Ziska died in 1424, but his\r\nsuccessor, Procopius, a former monk, was still more successful. He\r\ndefeated Sigismund at Miess and Tachau, and carried the war into\r\nAustria, Bavaria, Franconia, and Saxony. Meanwhile, the Hussites had\r\nseparated into two parties, the Taborites and Calixtines. In the\r\nbeginning they acted in perfect concert with each other. But in 1433 the\r\nCouncil of Basle succeeded in coming to an agreement with the Calixtines\r\nand in drawing them out of the contest; the result of which was that the\r\nTaborites were totally defeated at Bomishbrod in 1434. Toleration was\r\ngranted, and Sigismund entered Prague, August 23, 1436. The Hussites\r\nopposed his successor, Albert of Austria, and called Casimir of Poland\r\nto the throne, but were defeated in 1438. A portion of the Hussites\r\nexisted in the time of Luther, and were called “Bohemian Brethren.”\r\n\r\n=Hut.= Is a wooden structure, more or less rough in details, for the\r\nhousing of troops. It is substituted very often for the tent, when the\r\nsojourn in a camp or cantonment is likely to be of consideration, as,\r\nfor instance, through a winter,--a hut, however rude, which is wind- and\r\nwater-tight, being as superior in comfort to a tent as the latter is to\r\nthe open air. Huts may be made of almost any size, and are sometimes for\r\none officer; at others for as many as 100 men. The quarters occupied by\r\nU. S. troops on the American frontiers are very frequently huts made by\r\nthe troops.\r\n\r\n=Huy.= A town of Belgium, 18 miles southwest from Liege. This town has\r\nwithstood several sieges. Its fortifications were dismantled in 1718,\r\nbut in 1815 its castle was rebuilt.\r\n\r\n=Hyccara= (now _Muro di Carini_). A town of Sicani, on the north coast\r\nof Sicily, west of Panormus. It was taken by the Athenians and\r\nplundered, and its inhabitants sold as slaves, 415 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Hydaspes.= A river in India, where Alexander the Great defeated Porus,\r\nafter a severely contested engagement, in 327 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Hyder.= The Arabic term for lion. This title is frequently given to men\r\nof rank in India.\r\n\r\n=Hydraulic Jack.= A powerful portable apparatus for moving heavy weights\r\nthrough short distances, by an application of the principles of the\r\nhydrostatic press. There are two forms, the _lifting_- and\r\n_pulling_-jack. Those used in the American military service are of 80\r\ntons capacity.\r\n\r\n=Hydraulic Loading Apparatus.= The apparatus used in manœuvring heavy\r\nturret-guns in the English navy, invented by Mr. George Rendel (a member\r\nof Sir William Armstrong’s firm), and first tested in the working of a\r\n38-ton gun on the “Thunderer.” It was determined to similarly equip the\r\n“Inflexible,” with her 80-ton armament. The apparatus was thoroughly\r\ntested, in working the 100-ton guns delivered to the Italian government,\r\nin experiments at Spezzia, 1876. The working of the gun, including all\r\nthe operations of loading and sponging, is effected by means of\r\nhydraulic pumps, which are all operated by one small steam-engine. The\r\ngun is placed with its trunnions resting on two heavy blocks of metal,\r\nwhich, being retained by guides, slide on large beams or girders built\r\nin the floor of the turret. In front and rear of the blocks are pistons,\r\nworking in cylinders in the direction of the floor-beams. These pistons,\r\nunder the influence of water-pressure, move the gun in and out of\r\nbattery. The breech is raised and lowered by similar means. When the gun\r\nand trunnion-blocks rush back under the impulse of the recoil from\r\nfiring, the water in the rear cylinders is forced out through\r\nescape-valves, which are held down by springs under a tension of 50\r\natmospheres. The recoil is thus checked in the space of 3 or 4 feet. If\r\na larger charge is used the tension of the springs can be increased. The\r\nsprings only come into play in resisting the desperate force of recoil.\r\nThe water pumped into the cylinders (a valve at the rear opening\r\noutwards being raised) is sufficient to run the gun forward without\r\ndisplacing the recoil-valves, the working-pressure required being less\r\nthan 50 atmospheres.\r\n\r\nWhen the gun is to be loaded, it is run forward and the muzzle depressed\r\ntill it is in front of an armored hood, which shields an iron door in\r\nthe main deck. The door slides back, a sponge appears on the end of a\r\nstaff, which enters the bore and lengthens itself like a telescope till\r\nthe bottom is reached, when, in obedience to the touch of a valve, a\r\nflood of water is ejected from the sponge to extinguish fire and wash\r\nthe bore. The shot and cartridge next appear, lifted from below on a\r\nsmall truck, which is run out on a trap-door. The cartridge is lifted\r\nin front of the muzzle, the sponge--now converted into a rammer--pushes\r\nit a short distance into the gun, is then withdrawn, and when the shot\r\nrises pushes both to the bottom of the bore. The sponge is then\r\nwithdrawn below deck and the trap closes. Each of these movements is\r\neffected entirely by water-pressure, the course of the water and the\r\ncorresponding operation being determined by manipulating the proper\r\nvalve. The power is supplied by a small steam-engine specially designed\r\nfor the purpose. When no manœuvre is to be performed, the engine\r\noccupies itself in pumping water from the tank against the\r\nrecoil-valves. When the pressure rises above 50 atmospheres these valves\r\nallow a small quantity to escape, which runs back into the tank. The\r\nengine barely moves in this work. When any manœuvre is to be performed,\r\nsuch as running the gun forward, a handle is touched, the\r\ncylinder-valves open a passage to the water, and, the enormous\r\nresistance being removed, the engine rattles with energy, and the gun\r\nmoves forward as by magic. The valve being closed by the operator, the\r\nengine returns to its sisyphean labor of pumping water against the\r\nloaded valves till some new outlet gives it a specific task.\r\n\r\nEvery part of this apparatus, notwithstanding its provisional mounting,\r\nworked perfectly in the experiments at Spezzia.\r\n\r\nThe only defect in the principle was developed by the bursting of one,\r\nthe 38-ton gun of the “Thunderer” (January 2, 1879), which was worked by\r\nthis apparatus. The disaster has been generally attributed to the\r\npresence in the gun of a double charge of both shot and powder. This\r\ncould hardly have occurred in hand-loading. Steps have been taken to\r\nremedy the apparatus in this regard.\r\n\r\n=Hygrometer.= An instrument for measuring the degree of moisture of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n=Hygrometer, Daniell’s.= A form of hygrometer consisting of a bent glass\r\ntube terminating in two bulbs, the one covered with muslin, the other of\r\nblack glass, and containing ether and a thermometer. Ether being poured\r\non the muslin, the black ball, cooled by the evaporation of the ether\r\nwithin, is soon covered with dew, at which moment the receding of the\r\ninclosed thermometer, compared with that of another in the air, gives\r\nthe dew point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Iapydes.= A warlike and barbarous people in the north of Illyricum,\r\nbetween the rivers Arsia and Tedanius; were a mixed race, partly\r\nIllyrian and partly Celtic, who tattooed their bodies. They were subdued\r\nby Augustus. Their country was called Iaiydia.\r\n\r\n=Iazyges.= A powerful Sarmatian people, who originally dwelt on the\r\ncoast of the Pontus Euxinus and the Palus Mæotis; but in the reign of\r\nClaudius settled near the Quadi in Dacia, in the country bounded by the\r\nDanube, the Theiss, and the Sarmatian Mountains. The Iazyges were in\r\nclose alliance with the Quadi, along with whom they frequently attacked\r\nthe Roman dominions, especially Mœsia and Pannonia. In the 5th century\r\nthey were conquered by the Goths.\r\n\r\n=Ice.= In high latitudes, during the winter, rivers are frequently\r\ncovered with ice of sufficient thickness to sustain the heaviest loads.\r\nThis means of communication should be used with great circumspection. A\r\nchange of temperature may not only suddenly destroy this natural bridge,\r\nbut render the river impassable by any method for a considerable time in\r\nconsequence of the floating ice.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of ice should be, to allow the passage of infantry in\r\nsingle file on a line of planks, and 2 yards apart, 2 inches; cavalry or\r\nlight guns, with intervals, 4 inches; 12-pounder field-pieces,\r\nunlimbered and on sleds, 5 inches; 12-pounder field-pieces, limbered and\r\ndrawn by horses, with intervals between pieces, 6 to 7 inches. Ice when\r\n10 to 12 inches thick bears the heaviest loads. Two tracks of planks\r\nlaid on the ice for the carriage-wheels to run on, may be employed when\r\nthere is any doubt as to its strength, or the wagon may be transformed\r\ninto a sort of sled by fastening two planks under the wheels.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the ice may be increased, when the temperature is low\r\nenough, by throwing water on it.\r\n\r\nWhen the river is frozen on each side, but open in the middle in\r\nconsequence of the velocity of the current, a boom stretched across the\r\nopen space will often check the velocity sufficiently to cause the water\r\nto freeze.\r\n\r\n=Iceni.= A British tribe which inhabited chiefly Suffolk and Norfolk. In\r\n61, headed by Boadicea, their queen, they marched southwards and\r\ndestroyed Verulam, London, and other places, with great slaughter of the\r\nRomans, but were defeated by Suetonius near London, and their queen\r\nslain.\r\n\r\n=Ich Dien.= _I serve_; the motto under the plume of ostrich feathers\r\nfound in the helmet of the king of Bohemia after he was slain at the\r\nbattle of Crécy, at which he served as a volunteer in the French army,\r\nAugust 26, 1346. Edward the Black Prince, in veneration of his father,\r\nEdward III., who commanded that day, though the prince won the battle,\r\nadopted this motto, which has since been borne with the feathers by the\r\nheirs to the crown of England; but not as prince of Wales, which many\r\nhave erroneously maintained.\r\n\r\n=Ichnæ=, or =Ischnæ=. A Greek city in the north of Mesopotamia, founded\r\nby the Macedonians; was the scene of the first battle between Crassus\r\nand the Parthians, in which the former gained the victory. According to\r\nAppian, the Parthians soon after defeated the Romans near the same spot.\r\n\r\n=Ichnography.= The plan or representation of the length and breadth of a\r\nfortification, the distinct parts of which are marked out either on the\r\nground itself, or on paper. A plan upon the correct principles of\r\nichnography represents a work as it would appear if it were leveled to\r\nits foundations, and shows only the expanse of ground on which it had\r\nbeen erected. The science does not represent either the elevation or the\r\ndifferent parts belonging to a fortification. This properly comes under\r\nthe title “profile,” which does not, however, include length.\r\n\r\n=Iconium= (now _Konieh_). A town of Asia Minor, situated on the shores\r\nof the Lake Trogitis, about 120 miles inland from the Mediterranean. In\r\nancient times it was famous as the capital of Lycaonia, and from 1087 to\r\n1229 it was the seat of a Seljuk sultanate. In December, 1832, a battle\r\nwas fought here, in which Ibrahim Pasha completely defeated the Turkish\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n=Idaho.= A Territory of the United States, bounded on the north by the\r\nBritish possessions, on the east by Montana and Dakota, and on the south\r\nby Nevada and Utah. It was organized in 1863, and has frequently been\r\nthe scene of Indian troubles.\r\n\r\n=Idsted.= A village of Selswick. A battle was fought here in 1850,\r\nbetween the Danes and Schleswig-Holsteiners, in which the latter were\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n=Ignition= (Lat. _ignis_, “fire”). The act of setting fire to, or of\r\ntaking fire; as opposed to combustion or burning, which is a consequence\r\nof ignition. By ignition of gunpowder is understood the setting on fire\r\nof a particular point of the charge.\r\n\r\n=Ilerda= (now _Lerida_). A town of the Ilergetes, in Hispania\r\nTarraconensis, situated on a height above the river Sicoris (now\r\n_Segre_). It was afterwards a Roman colony, but in the time of Ausonius\r\nhad ceased to be a place of importance. It was here that Africanus and\r\nPetreius, the legates of Pompey, were defeated by Cæsar, 49 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Illinois.= One of the Central States of the United States, in the\r\nvalley of the Upper Mississippi, and one of the most fertile in the\r\nUnion, having scarcely any soil which is uncultivable. It was originally\r\nsettled by the French, but fell into the hands of the English in 1763,\r\nbecoming the property of the United States at the Revolution. It was\r\norganized as a State December 3, 1818, and during the civil war was a\r\nstaunch supporter of the Union.\r\n\r\n=Illinois Indians.= A confederacy of Indian tribes, mostly of Algonkin\r\nstock, who formerly inhabited the State now known by their name. Very\r\nfew relics of these tribes now exist.\r\n\r\n=Illustrious.= Conferring lustre or honor; brilliant; renowned; as,\r\nillustrious deeds or titles.\r\n\r\n=Illyricum=, or =Illyria=. Is the Roman name of a country whose limits\r\nin ancient times varied considerably. It was inhabited by a savage\r\ntribe, who were much addicted to piracy and robbery. In 359 B.C. Philip\r\nof Macedon conquered the eastern portion of the country, now Albania,\r\nand it was incorporated with Macedonia. The Illyrians were brought into\r\na collision with the Romans on account of their piracy, which led to\r\ntheir subjugation about two centuries before the Christian era. They\r\nmade numerous efforts to shake off the Roman yoke, but were always\r\ndefeated, and the country became a most important province of the Roman\r\nempire, comprising the territory represented in modern times by Croatia,\r\nDalmatia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, nearly all Bosnia, and a part of\r\nAlbania. On the division of the Roman empire, it shared in the\r\nvicissitudes that followed that act. A decree of Napoleon, on October\r\n14, 1809, gave the name of Illyrian provinces to Carniola, Dalmatia, and\r\nother countries from the Adriatic Sea to the Save, then belonging to the\r\nFrench empire. At his fall these provinces were united as a kingdom to\r\nthe Austrian empire, and some alterations were made in its boundaries,\r\nespecially by the restoration to Hungary of what had formerly belonged\r\nto it, and the annexation of the whole of Carinthia.\r\n\r\n=Ilmenau.= A town of Saxe-Weimar, on the Ilm, 18 miles west from Weimar.\r\nA battle was fought by the united forces of the Russians and Saxons\r\nagainst the Swedes near this town in 1706.\r\n\r\n=Imbannered.= Furnished with banners.\r\n\r\n=Imbellic.= Not warlike or martial. This term is now obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Imbody.= See EMBODY.\r\n\r\n=Imbrued=, or =Embrued=. An expression used in heraldry to signify\r\nbloody, or dropping with blood. Weapons thus blazoned are drawn with\r\ndrops of blood falling from them.\r\n\r\n=Imeritia.= Formerly an independent Transcaucasian territory, now part\r\nof the government of Kutais. Its history as an independent dominion\r\ncommenced from about the beginning of the 15th century, and was long\r\nmarked by internal dissensions. In 1745, Solomon I. was proclaimed, but\r\nhis nobles revolting shortly after, and aided by the Turks, dethroned\r\nhim. Solomon applied for help to Russia, and in 1769, Count Todtlen, at\r\nthe head of a Russian force, entered Emeritia, restored the king, and\r\ndrove back the Turks. The civil dissensions of this province, however,\r\ncontinued, and at last, in 1810, after having long acknowledged\r\nallegiance to Russia, it was formally incorporated in, and proclaimed a\r\nprovince of that empire.\r\n\r\n=Immailed.= Wearing mail or armor; clad in armor. This term is now\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n=Immartial.= Not martial; not warlike. This term is now obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Immortals.= In antiquity, the name of a body of 10,000 troops,\r\nconstituting the guard of the king of Persia; so called because they\r\nwere always of the same number; for as soon as any of them died, the\r\nvacancy was immediately filled up. They were distinguished from all the\r\nother troops by the richness of their armor, and still more by their\r\nbravery. The same term was applied to the life-guards of the Roman\r\nemperors.\r\n\r\n=Imola.= A fortified town of Ravenna, a province of Italy, on a small\r\nisland in the river Santerno; it is defended by a strong castle. This\r\ntown was founded by the Lombards on the ruins of Forum Cornelii,\r\ndestroyed by Justinian, and was afterwards successively held by\r\ndifferent chiefs who ruled in Central Italy. Julius II. annexed it to\r\nthe States of the Church, but it was delivered from the papal yoke when\r\nRavenna declared for annexation to Sardinia in 1859.\r\n\r\n=Impact.= In gunnery, the single instantaneous blow or stroke of a body\r\nin motion against another either in motion or at rest.\r\n\r\n=Impale.= In heraldry, to arrange two coats of arms side by side in one\r\nshield divided per pale. It is usual thus to exhibit the conjoined coats\r\nof husband and wife, the husband’s arms occupying the dexter, or right\r\nside, and the wife’s the sinister, or left side, of the escutcheon.\r\n\r\n=Impedimenta.= The accompaniments to an army received from the Romans\r\nthe name of impedimenta. They consist in transportation of munitions,\r\nequipments, provisions, hospital supplies, tents, engineering tools,\r\nbridge equipage, and boats, baggage, cooking utensils, etc., necessary\r\nfor the use of an army moving against an enemy. This requires the use of\r\nlarge numbers of wagons and of draught animals, or shipping, and\r\nnecessarily impedes the movement of an army. See BAGGAGE.\r\n\r\n=Impenetrable.= Incapable of being penetrated or pierced, not admitting\r\nthe passage of other bodies, not to be entered; as, an impenetrable\r\nshield.\r\n\r\n=Imperator.= An old Roman title signifying commander, which was applied\r\nto the rulers of provinces, consuls, pro-consuls, etc., or to anybody\r\nwho had an _imperium_ assigned him.

The implements for loading cannon are,\r\n(1) The _rammer-head_, a short cylindrical piece of beech or other tough\r\nwood, fixed to the end of a long stick of ash, called a _staff_,\r\nemployed to push the charge to its place in the bore or chamber of a\r\ncannon. (2) The _sponge_, a _woolen_ brush attached to the end of a\r\nstaff, for the purpose of cleaning the interior of cannon and\r\nextinguishing any burning fragments of the cartridge that may remain\r\nafter firing. In the field and mountain services, the rammer-head and\r\nsponge are attached to the opposite ends of the same shaft; in the siege\r\nand sea-coast services, they are attached to separate staves, except for\r\nhowitzers, in which they are combined. (3) The _ladle_, a copper scoop\r\nattached to the end of a staff for the purpose of withdrawing the\r\nprojectile of a loaded piece.

(11) The _fuze-setter_, a brass drift for driving a wooden fuze\r\ninto a shell. (12) The _fuze-mallet_, made of hard wood, and used in\r\nconnection with the setter. (13) The _fuze-saw_, a 10-inch tenon saw for\r\ncutting wooden or paper fuzes to the required length. (14) The\r\n_fuze-gimlet_, sometimes employed in place of the saw to open a\r\ncommunication with the fuze composition. (15) The _fuze-auger_, an\r\ninstrument for regulating the time of burning of a fuze by removing a\r\ncertain portion of the composition from the exterior. For this purpose\r\nit has a movable graduated scale, which regulates the depth to which the\r\nauger should penetrate. (16) The _fuze-rasp_, a coarse file employed in\r\nfitting a fuze-plug to a shell. (17) The _fuze-plug reamer_, used to\r\nenlarge the cavity of a fuze-plug after it has been driven into a\r\nprojectile, to enable it to receive a paper fuze. (18) The _shell-plug\r\nscrew_, a wood screw with a handle, used to extract a plug from a\r\nfuze-hole. (19) The _fuze-extractor_, worked by a screw, and is a more\r\npowerful instrument than the preceding; it is used for extracting wooden\r\nfuzes from loaded shells. (20) The _fuze-wrench_, made in the form of a\r\ncross or T-shaped, to unscrew percussion fuzes. (21) The\r\n_mortar-scraper_, a slender piece of iron with a spoon at one end and a\r\nscraper at the other, for cleaning the chamber of a mortar. (22) The\r\n_gunner’s sleeves_, made of flannel or serge; they are drawn over the\r\ncoat-sleeves of the gunner to prevent them from being soiled while\r\nloading a mortar. (23) The _funnel_, made of copper, and used in pouring\r\nthe bursting charge into a shell. (24) The _powder-measures_, made of\r\ncopper, of cylindrical form, and of various sizes, for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the charges of shells and cannon by measurement. (25) The\r\n_lanyard_, a cord, one end of which has a small iron hook, and the other\r\na wooden handle. It is used to explode the friction-tubes with which\r\ncannon for the land service are now fired. (26) The _gunner’s gimlet_\r\nand _vent-punch_, used in boring out the vent when it becomes foul. (27)\r\n_Gunner’s pincers_ (which see). (28) The _shell-hooks_, an instrument\r\nmade to fasten into the ears of a shell, for the purpose of lifting it\r\nto the muzzle of the piece. (29) The _tow-hook_, in field service, used\r\nin unpacking ammunition and taking projectiles from the chest. The\r\nimplements for pointing are: the _gunner’s level_, _gunner’s quadrant_,\r\nthe _breech-sight_, the _pendulum-hausse_, and _elevating arc_. (See\r\nappropriate headings.) The _tangent-scale_, a brass plate, the lower\r\nedge of which is cut to the curve of the base-ring of the piece, and the\r\nupper formed into offsets which correspond to differences of elevation\r\nof a quarter of a degree. It is used in pointing by placing the curved\r\nedge on the base-ring, with the radius of the offset corresponding with\r\nthe highest point of the ring, and sighting over the centre of the\r\noffset, and the highest point of the swell of the muzzle. The principal\r\nmanœuvring implements are: the _trail handspike_, the _manœuvring\r\nhandspike_, the _shod handspike_, the _truck handspike_, the _roller\r\nhandspike_ (see HANDSPIKE); the _prolonge_, a stout rope used to connect\r\nthe lunette of the carriage and pintle-hook of the limber to move the\r\npiece short distances without limber; the _sponge-bucket_, made of\r\nsheet-iron, for washing the bore of the piece; the _tar-bucket_, also\r\nmade of sheet-iron, for carrying grease for the wheels; the _watering\r\nbucket_, made of sole-leather, for watering the horses; the\r\n_water-buckets_, made of wood and bound with iron hoops. These are of\r\ntwo kinds,--one for the traveling-forge, and the other for the service\r\nof garrison batteries. The _drag-rope_, used when necessary to employ a\r\nnumber of men in hauling loads, or extricating a carriage from a\r\ndifficult part of the road. It has a hook at one end, a loop at the\r\nother, and six wooden handles placed about 4 feet apart. The _men’s\r\nharness_, similar to the drag-rope, except that the rope is stouter, and\r\nthe handles are replaced by leather loops which pass over the shoulders\r\nof the men, to enable them to exert their strength to advantage. The\r\n_bill-hook_, or hand-bill, used for cutting twigs. The _screw-jack_, a\r\nlifting-machine composed of a screw worked by a _movable nut_ supported\r\non a _cast-iron stand_. It is used in greasing carriage-wheels.\r\nArtillery machines comprise the _gin_ (see GIN), the _sling-cart_ (see\r\nHAND-SLING-CART), the _casemate truck_, the _hand-cart_ (see HAND-CART),\r\nthe _lifting-jack_, and the _lever-jack_. The casemate truck is composed\r\nof a stout frame of wood mounted on three barbette traverse-wheels, and\r\nis employed to move cannon and carriages through posterns and along\r\ncasemate galleries. The lifting-jack is a small but powerful screw,\r\nworked by a geared nut. It is useful when the space for manœuvring is\r\nsmall, and the number of men limited. If the weight to be raised is\r\nsufficiently high, the lifting power is applied at the top; if it be\r\nlow, it is applied at the foot. The lever-jack is another but less\r\npowerful apparatus for lifting. It consists of a _lever_ of wood resting\r\non a _bolt_, which passes through holes in two _uprights_. The height of\r\nthe bolt is varied by passing it through different holes in the uprights\r\n(eight in number), and the power of the lever is regulated by a notched\r\npiece of cast iron screwed to the under side of the lever.\r\n\r\n=Implements, Re-loading.= See RE-LOADING IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Impregnable.= Not to be stormed, or taken by assault; incapable of\r\nbeing reduced by force; able successfully to resist attack; as, an\r\nimpregnable fortress.\r\n\r\n=Impregnably.= In an impregnable manner; in a manner to defy force; as,\r\na place impregnably fortified.\r\n\r\n=Impress.= To compel any person to serve.\r\n\r\n=Impression.= The effect of an attack upon any place or body of\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n=Imprisonment.= Officers may be sentenced to imprisonment by a general\r\ncourt-martial in any case where the court may have discretionary\r\nauthority.

When a court awards\r\nsolitary imprisonment as a punishment, it is necessary that the words\r\n“solitary confinement” should be expressed in the sentence. The legal\r\nimprisonment in the United States is confinement, solitary confinement,\r\nand confinement on bread and water; confinement on bread and water shall\r\nnot extend over fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the\r\nperiods of such confinement not less than such periods, and not\r\nexceeding eighty-four days in any one year.\r\n\r\n=Impulse.= The act of impelling, or driving onward with sudden force;\r\nimpulsion; the action of a force so as to produce motion suddenly, or\r\nwithout appreciable loss of time.

The tangent of the angle, which may be taken as a\r\nmeasure of the inclination, is equal to the circumference of the bore\r\ndivided by the length of bore corresponding to one revolution of the\r\nspiral. See TWIST.\r\n\r\n=Incline.= To gain ground to the flank, as well as to the front.\r\nInclining is of great use in the marching of the line in front, to\r\ncorrect any irregularities that may happen. It is equivalent to the\r\nquarter facing and to the oblique marching of the infantry.

An extensive region of Southern Asia,\r\ncelebrated during many ages for its riches and natural productions. The\r\nHindoo histories ascribe the origin of the people to a period ages\r\nbefore the ordinary chronologies. A race of kings is mentioned as\r\nreigning 2300 B.C. Several ancient nations, particularly the Tyrians and\r\nEgyptians, carried on commerce with India. It was partially conquered by\r\nDarius Hystaspes, who formed an Indian satrapy, 512 B.C., and by\r\nAlexander, 327 B.C. The authentic history of Hindostan commences with\r\nthe conquests of Mahmoud Ghuzni, 1004.

This building consists of several\r\ncontinued terraces, which are of the same height as the main rampart,\r\nand communicate with it; the inward walls of these terraces form the\r\nsides of an intricate passage, about 20 feet broad, which leads by\r\nvarious short turnings, at right angles, through the whole pile to the\r\nprincipal gate that stands in the main rampart. This is the general\r\noutline of the old Indian fortifications.\r\n\r\n=Indian Military Force.= The East Indian military service, like the\r\ncivil service, has been undergoing a thorough reorganization, consequent\r\non the great mutiny, and the transfer of the government of the country\r\nfrom the East India Company to the crown. In 1857, at the outbreak of\r\nthe mutiny, the Indian army consisted of about 277,000 men, of whom\r\n45,000 were Europeans and 232,000 natives. During the mutiny the native\r\narmy of Bengal was almost entirely broken up. Fifteen regiments of\r\nregular native infantry, the local infantry, the Gurka and irregular\r\nline regiments, eight regiments of irregular cavalry, and the sappers\r\nand miners, were all that remained at the close of 1860 of the old\r\nnative army of Bengal. The Indian army in 1867 numbered 183,148 men;\r\n61,498 being Europeans, and 121,650 Indian forces. The police, civil and\r\nmilitary, forms an important force, and is to a great extent taking the\r\nplace of the regular army. In Bengal, for instance, the military police\r\nincludes ten battalions of infantry each 700 strong; three squadrons of\r\ncavalry, and some local levies; in all about 10,000 men, of various\r\nraces, with 40 European officers.

It was settled in the early part of the 18th\r\ncentury by the French; was subsequently ceded to the English, and after\r\nthe Revolution passed into the possession of the United States. The\r\nearly settlers were for a long time troubled by the incursions of the\r\nIndians; but after their signal defeat by Gen. Harrison at Tippecanoe,\r\nNovember 7, 1811, they were soon afterwards subdued, and became\r\npeaceable. Indiana was admitted as a State in 1816, and during the civil\r\nwar contributed its full quota of troops to the support of the Union.\r\n\r\n=Indians.= The name by which the various tribes of aborigines scattered\r\nover the extensive continent of America are distinguished. They are\r\ndivided into numerous tribes and nations, all in a state more or less\r\nsavage, and having all the peculiar characteristics of that kind of\r\nlife. They generally decline as the civilized population advances into\r\nthe country; though reservations of land have always been set apart by\r\nthe U. S. government for the support of tribes within its territory.\r\n(See INDIANS AND THEIR AGENCIES.) A short description of the most\r\nimportant tribes will be found under appropriate headings in this work.\r\n\r\n=Indians and their Agencies.= The following are the distribution and\r\npopulation of the Indians in the United States, taken from the Report of\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1876:\r\n\r\nARIZONA, _Colorado River Agency_: Mojaves, 820; Chemehuevis, 320;\r\nHualapais (not on reservation), 620; Coahuilas (not on reservation),\r\n150; Cocopas (not on reservation), 180. _Moquis Pueblo Agency_: Moquis\r\nPueblos, 1700. _Pima and Maricopa Agency_: Papagos, about 5000; Pimas,\r\n4100; Maricopas, 400. _San Carlos Agency_: Pinal and Aribaipa Apaches,\r\n1051; Chiricahua Apaches, 297; Mojave Apaches, 618; Yuma Apaches, 352;\r\nTonto Apaches, 629; Coyotero Apaches, 1612.

This tribe is at present the\r\nsouthern and eastern limit of the Innuit, or Esquimo races, although at\r\none time they undoubtedly extended to the mouth of the Stickeen River.\r\n\r\n_Aleuts._ On the advent of the Russians, about 150 years ago, the twenty\r\nAleut races numbered about 10,000 people; they had marked peculiarities\r\nand well-defined tribal divisions. The cruelty, oppression, and\r\npersecution of the Russians rapidly decreased their numbers; their\r\nnatural and tribal distinctions were lost and forgotten; they were\r\nentirely cowed and subdued; they embraced Greek Christianity, and were\r\ntransported by their conquerors all along the coast.\r\n\r\n_Khagántagákuhn._ Number 350, and inhabit western end of Aliaska\r\npeninsula and Shumagin Islands.\r\n\r\n_Unaláshkuhns._ Number 750; inhabit Unalask, Unmak, and Priboloff\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n_Atkanhun._ Number 470, and inhabit the Western Islands.\r\n\r\n_Tinneh._ Interior Indian tribes belonging to the same family; occupy\r\neither flank of the Rocky Mountains, from the mouth of Mackenzie’s River\r\nsouthward as far as Mexico.

This is one of the two tribes that have forced their way\r\nthrough the Ararians and conduct their annual trading independent of the\r\nmiddlemen of the coast.\r\n\r\n_Tchaninkutchin._ Number about 1000, and inhabit north shore of Kenai\r\npeninsula and basin of Suchinto River. This is the second instance of\r\ninterior Indians proper who have forced their way through the Ararians.\r\nLess is known of them than any other coast tribes; they are intelligent\r\nand warlike, and subsist on mountain-sheep, with the skins of which they\r\nclothe themselves.\r\n\r\n_Nehannees._ A name given to a number of tribes who inhabit the\r\nhead-waters of the Yukon, Mackenzie, and Stickeen Rivers. By the late\r\nGeorge Gibbs, they are of a low grade and little is known of their\r\npeculiarities or numbers. They consist of the _Abbatotena_, who inhabit\r\nthe basin of the Pelly and MacMillan Rivers, and are called by the\r\nHudson Bay people “Gens du Bois.” The _Mauvais Mondi_, inhabiting basin\r\nof Francis Lake. _Architotena_, called Sicannees by the Hudson Bay\r\npeople, inhabit the head-waters of the Deas and Laird’s Rivers. The\r\n_Dahotena_, inhabiting the head-waters of the Stickeen, and the\r\n_Iahko-tena_, in the basin of the Lewis River.\r\n\r\n_Chilkahtena._ Inhabit head-waters of rivers that rise near the\r\nhead-waters of the Chilkuht that flow north into the Yukon. They are\r\nbold and warlike; number about 500; are middlemen traders between the\r\nChilkhut Ihlinkets, who do not allow them to descend the Chilkhut, and\r\ninterior tribes.\r\n\r\n_Jnahnkutchin._ Number about 800, and live in basin of Jenanah River,\r\nthe principal tributary of the Yukon, are nomadic, live on deer, and\r\ntrap fox and sable for trade; are regarded by their neighbors, whom they\r\nvisit annually for trading purposes, with fear and terror.\r\n\r\n_Kutchkutchin._ Number about 400, and inhabit about 350 miles of the\r\nYukon valley.\r\n\r\n_Natsitkutchin._ The “Gens de Rats” of the Hudson Bay people; occupy\r\nthe north side of the Porcupine; number not known.\r\n\r\n_Inkuthkutchin._ 250 in number; inhabit south bank of Porcupine.\r\n\r\n_Hankutchin._ Number not known; occupy 300 miles of Yukon valley that is\r\ndensely wooded.\r\n\r\n_Intchuon Kutchin._ Very numerous, “the Gens de Foix” of the Hudson Bay\r\npeople; occupy the basin of the White, the Lewis, and the Stewart River;\r\nthey are of nomadic habits, amiable and remarkably honest. They trade\r\nwith the Atna River Indians.\r\n\r\n_Ihlinkets._ A stock of Indians inhabiting the islands of the Alexander\r\nArchipelago from lat. 60° N. to the head or north end of Vancouver\r\nIsland. They are essentially maritime and commercial; they travel\r\nentirely by canoes, in which they make voyages hundreds of miles in\r\nlength. They live in fixed villages, always built upon the shores of\r\nbays or rivers in the most substantial manner of heavy timber, often\r\nshowing great mechanical skill, and frequently arranged with regard for\r\ncapacity for defense. They own slaves, cremate their dead, and are\r\nindustrious and frugal as well as cruel, warlike, and aggressive in\r\ntheir nature.\r\n\r\n_Yakutats._ Numbering about 350; inhabit the coast from Mount St. Elias\r\nto Mount Crilton, their principal village being at Port Mulgrove,\r\nBehring’s Bay. They cure salmon to live upon, hunt the seal and\r\nsea-otter for trade. They eat the blubber and flesh of the whale, and\r\noften voyage as far south as Fort Simpson, in lat. 54° N.\r\n\r\n_Chilkahtknan._ Number about 1500 in the village of Chilkaht and\r\nIselkort Rivers and head of Lyn Channel; they are fierce and warlike,\r\noften at war with the southern Indians; make annual trading voyages,\r\ncarrying peltries obtained from interior Indians as far south as\r\nVictoria, Vancouver Island, receiving in exchange blankets, powder,\r\nball, hardware, and molasses and sugar.\r\n\r\n_Sitkakneen._ Number about 1200 or 1500, and inhabit the shore of Cross\r\nSound, Checkayoff, Kruyoff, and Buranoff Islands. Their principal\r\nvillage is Sitka, Buranoff Island. They are called Kolases by Russians,\r\nwhom it took many years to subdue to a sufficient extent to make a\r\nfoothold in their country. They frequently fought the intruders, and as\r\nlate as 1855 perpetrated a bloody massacre, killing a whole congregation\r\nwho were worshiping in a church. Before the advent of the Russians they\r\nwere often at war with their neighbors, and before being subject to an\r\nepidemic of smallpox and a massacre by the Stickeens were much more\r\nnumerous. The Russians employ large numbers of them at ship-building.\r\nThey are industrious and have much mechanical skill in working both wood\r\nand metals. Large numbers of them have been baptized into the Greek\r\nChurch, but Christianity never made much impression upon them.\r\n\r\n_Kootznonknan._ Numbering about 300; inhabit Admiralty Island, their\r\nprincipal village being at Hood’s Bay. They resemble the Sitkas, with\r\nwhom they intermarry. They were the first to distill a kind of liquor\r\nfrom molasses or sugar and potatoes or beans, which is now a universal\r\ncustom in Alaska, and is demoralizing the native population to a great\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n_Jahkuknan._ Numbering about 250 in the basin of the Jashku River and\r\nshore of Stephen’s Pass; resemble the Sitkas.\r\n\r\n_Kakenan._ Number about 200; inhabit Kow and several other islands in\r\nStephen’s Pass; warlike and treacherous.

They also manufacture and\r\nsupply yellow-cedar canoes of immense size to northern Indians.\r\n\r\n=Indications, Military.= See MILITARY INDICATIONS.\r\n\r\n=Indicator.= An invention of Gen. Wingate, of the New York Militia, for\r\ninstructing men in aiming the musket. A steel rod passing through a\r\nbrass tompon in the muzzle is projected forwards by the firing-pin. The\r\nrod carries a sharp point in the line of the sights, which punctures a\r\nminiature target a foot or so in front of the muzzle.\r\n\r\n=Indisciplinable.= Not disciplinable; incapable of being disciplined, or\r\nsubjected to discipline; undisciplinable.\r\n\r\n=Indiscipline.= Want of discipline or instruction.\r\n\r\n=Indore.= The capital of the principality of the same name in India, on\r\nthe left bank of the Kuthi. This place, mean and insignificant enough in\r\nitself, acquired considerable notoriety in connection with the grand\r\nrevolt of 1857. Though Holkar, the rajah, remained faithful to the\r\nBritish government, yet his troops mutinied on July 1, holding their\r\nprince as a prisoner in his palace, and butchering many Europeans, men,\r\nwomen, and children, in cold blood.\r\n\r\n=Inefficient.= Incapable of, or indisposed to, effective action;\r\neffecting nothing; as, an inefficient force.\r\n\r\n=Inergetic.= Having no energy; as, an inergetic officer.\r\n\r\n=Inescutcheon.= In heraldry, a small escutcheon borne within a shield.\r\n\r\n=Inexperienced.= Not having experience; unskilled; as, an inexperienced\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n=Inexpugnable.= Incapable of being subdued by force; impregnable.\r\n\r\n=Infamous Behavior.= In the British service a term peculiarly applicable\r\nto military life when it is affected by dishonorable conduct; on\r\nconviction of which, an officer is ordered to be cashiered. Infamy may\r\nbe attached to an officer or soldier in a variety of ways; and some\r\ncountries are more tenacious than others on this head. Among European\r\nnations it has always been deemed infamous and disgraceful to abandon\r\nthe field of action or to desert the colors. In Germany a mark of infamy\r\nwas attached to the character of every man who was found guilty of\r\nmisbehavior before the enemy. Among the Romans it was considered as\r\ninfamous and disgraceful to be taken prisoner, and a Roman soldier was\r\nimpressed with the idea that he must either conquer or die on the field.\r\nThere are various occasions in which the conduct of an officer may\r\nrender him unworthy of the situation he fills, such as cheating at play,\r\ntaking unfair advantages of youth, imposing upon the credulity or\r\nconfidence of a tradesman, habitual drunkenness, flagrant breaches of\r\nhospitality, etc.\r\n\r\n=Infantry= (Lat. _infans_, “child,” or “servant,” applied to servants\r\nwho went on foot, and _infanterie_, to foot-soldiers generally). Is that\r\nportion of a military establishment using small-arms and equipped for\r\nmarching and fighting on foot, in contradistinction to artillery and\r\ncavalry. It is the oldest of the “three arms” into which armies are\r\nconventionally divided; was the favorite of the Greeks, the Gauls, the\r\nGermans, and the Franks, and was that mainly with which Rome conquered\r\nthe world. Under Grecian and Roman civilization it attained pre-eminence\r\nas the _arm of battle_, but fell into contempt and comparative desuetude\r\nearly in the Middle Ages, and did not emerge from that obscurity till\r\nthe decline of the feudal system. It was first revived by the Swiss,\r\nwho, armed with the pike, withstood the most famous chivalry of Europe.\r\nAfterwards the Spanish infantry, armed with the musket, and led by Alva\r\nand the Duke of Parma, Cortez and Pizarro, became the terror of two\r\ncontinents. The other states of Europe were not slow in learning the\r\nlesson. Infantry steadily increased in power and importance from the\r\nfirst years of the 14th century, and is now recognized as constituting\r\nthe principal strength of military organizations. This importance\r\nresults from the fact that it can be used everywhere, “in mountains or\r\non plains, in woody or open countries, in cities or in fields, on rivers\r\nor at sea, in the redoubt or in the attack on the breach.” It is the\r\nself-sustaining arm in the field of battle, and is, moreover, less\r\nexpensive, man for man, than its auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n=Infantry Exercise.= The use of the rifle, and manœuvres for regiments\r\nof infantry, according to the regulations issued by the War Department.\r\n\r\n=Infantry, Heavy-armed.= Among the ancients were such as wore a complete\r\nsuit of armor, and engaged with broad shields and long spears. They were\r\nthe flower and strength of the Grecian armies, and had the highest rank\r\nof military honor.\r\n\r\n=Infantry, Light.= Came into use after the year 1656. They had no camp\r\nequipage to carry, and their arms and accoutrements were much lighter\r\nthan the common infantry, or battalion men; they were used as\r\nskirmishers, etc.\r\n\r\n=Infantry, Light-armed.= Among the ancients, were designed for\r\nskirmishes, and for fighting at a distance. Their weapons were arrows,\r\ndarts, or slings.\r\n\r\n=Infantry Tactics.= See TACTICS.\r\n\r\n=Inferior.= In a military sense means simply junior in rank, having a\r\nlower rank.\r\n\r\n=Infest.= To trouble greatly; to disturb; to annoy; to harass; as, the\r\nsea is infested with pirates; parties of the enemy infest the coast.\r\n\r\n=Infile.= To arrange in a file or rank; to place in order. This term is\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n=Inflammation.= When grains of powder are united to form a charge, and\r\nfire is communicated to one of them, the heated and expansive gases\r\nevolved insinuate themselves into the interstices of the charge, envelop\r\nthe grains, and ignite them, one after the other. This propagation of\r\nignition is called _inflammation_, and its velocity the _velocity of\r\ninflammation_. It is much greater than that of combustion, and it should\r\nnot be confounded with it. The _velocity of inflammation_ of powder\r\ncompressed by pounding is about .64 inch, while that of mealed powder in\r\nthe same condition is only .45 inch. Inflammation, in the study of\r\ngunpowder, is the spread of the flame from one grain to another--as\r\nopposed to ignition; the setting on fire of a certain point of the\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n=Informant.= In case a civil person is the complainant, he becomes the\r\nprincipal witness before a court-martial, and after giving his evidence\r\nmay remain in court, in order that the judge-advocate may refer to him.\r\n\r\n=Informers.= In the British service, were soldiers who gave information\r\nof false musters, or of pay illegally detained; and were, for said\r\nservices, entitled to their discharge.\r\n\r\n=Ingauni.= A Ligurian tribe who formerly inhabited the sea-coast and\r\nadjoining mountains at the foot of the Maritime Alps, on the west side\r\nof the Gulf of Genoa. They are mentioned as being engaged in hostilities\r\nwith a neighboring tribe, the Epanterii, on the occasion of the landing\r\nof Mago, the brother of Hannibal, B.C. 205. They were several times\r\nengaged in wars with the Romans, but were finally defeated by the\r\npro-consul, Æmilius Paullus, in a decisive engagement (losing 15,000\r\nkilled and 2500 prisoners), which resulted in their ultimate submission\r\nto the Roman sway.\r\n\r\n=Inglorious.= Shameful; disgraceful; ignominious; as, he charged his\r\ntroops with inglorious flight.\r\n\r\n=Inimical.= Hostile.\r\n\r\n=Initial Velocity.= In England the term _muzzle velocity_ is frequently\r\nused. In gunnery, the initial velocity of a projectile is the velocity\r\nat the muzzle of the piece, and is determined by the use of the\r\nballistic pendulum, the gun pendulum, the electro-ballistic machines,\r\nthe Schultz chronoscope, or the Le Boulengé chronograph; the two last\r\nbeing now generally used in the U. S. service. The various plans in use\r\ndiffer only in the manner of recording and keeping the time of flight.\r\nThe initial velocity of a shot may be ascertained by firing the gun, the\r\naxis being horizontal, at a target and measuring the _distance_ of the\r\npoint struck below the point where the axis of the gun produced would\r\npierce the target. _This_ is the vertical distance fallen through by the\r\nball in the time of passage from the muzzle to the target, and the time\r\nin which it falls through this distance is given by the formula\r\n\r\n         (2_s_)\r\n  _t_ = √(----)\r\n         ( _g_)\r\n\r\nin which _t_ represents the time, _s_ the vertical space fallen through,\r\nand _g_ the force of gravity. The distance to the target divided by this\r\n_time_ gives the initial velocity approximately. Practically, this\r\nmethod is only applicable to large breech-loading cannon, which have\r\nneither windage nor vibration in the barrel to affect the angle of\r\ndeparture of the projectile. Smooth-bores or muzzle-loading rifles are\r\nsubject to the first cause of error; the first-named guns in a great\r\ndegree, and small-arms to vibrations not yet fully investigated, which\r\ncause a sensible difference between the axis of the piece as pointed and\r\nthe line of fire. The causes that affect initial velocity are the weight\r\nof the charge, the size and position of the vent, the windage, the\r\nlength of the bore, the form of the chamber, the diameter and density of\r\nthe projectile, the windage of the cartridge; the form, size, density,\r\nand dryness of the grains of powder; and the barometric, thermometric,\r\nand hygrometric states of the atmosphere. See VELOCITY.\r\n\r\n=Injuries to Cannon.= Brass cannon are little subject to external injury\r\ncaused by service, except from the bending of the trunnions sometimes,\r\nafter long service or heavy charges. Internal injuries are caused by the\r\naction of the elastic fluids developed in the combustion of the powder,\r\nor by the action of the shot in passing out of the bore. These effects\r\ngenerally increase with the caliber of the piece. The principal injury\r\nof the first kind is the cutting away of the metal of the upper surface\r\nof the bore over the seat of the shot. The injuries of the second kind\r\nare, the _lodgment of the shot_,--a compression of the metal on the\r\nlower side of the bore, at the seat of the shot, which is caused by the\r\npressure of the gas in escaping over the top of the shot. There is a\r\ncorresponding _burr_ in front of the lodgment, and the motion therefore\r\ngiven to the shot causes it to strike alternately on the top and bottom\r\nof the bore, producing other _enlargements_, generally _three_ in\r\nnumber, the first on the upper side a little in advance of the\r\ntrunnions, the second on the lower side about the astragal, the third in\r\nthe upper part of the muzzle. It is chiefly from this cause that brass\r\nguns become unserviceable. _Scratches_, caused by the fragments of a\r\nbroken shot, or the roughness of an imperfect one. A piece is said to be\r\n_honeycombed_ when the surface of the bore is full of small holes and\r\ncavities. This is due to the melting and volatilization of a portion of\r\ntin in the alloy, tin being much more fusible than copper. Iron cannon\r\nare subject to the above defects in a less degree than brass, except the\r\ncorrosion of the metal, by which the vent is rendered unserviceable from\r\nenlargement. The one cause of injury to iron cannon is the rusting of\r\nthe metal, producing a roughness and enlargement of the bore and an\r\nincrease of any cavities or honeycombs which may exist in the metal.\r\n\r\nIron cannon, however, are subject to a peculiar erosion by the gases,\r\nwhich Prof. Horsford explains by supposing that under the enormous\r\ntension and heat the sulphur in the gases unites with the iron,\r\nproducing a friable sulphide of iron, which is successively formed and\r\nswept off by the gases. Wrought-iron guns are peculiarly subject to this\r\nerosion, cast-iron and steel less so. The amount of erosion is dependent\r\nupon the velocity with which the gases pass over the surface of the\r\nbore. In rifled wrought-iron guns having windage this action is fully\r\nillustrated, and the gun is soon disabled. The strong preference in many\r\ncountries for steel as a bore lining is thus explained. By the use of\r\nexpanding projectiles this action is largely prevented, the sabot acting\r\nas a gas-check. This system of projectiles is rapidly gaining favor for\r\nthis and other reasons.\r\n\r\n=Inkerman.= A small Tartar village in the Crimea, situated near the\r\neastern extremity of the harbor of Sebastopol. It was once a celebrated\r\ncity, and has numerous caverns cut in the rock, supposed to be the work\r\nof the monks in the Middle Ages. Near this place, November 5, 1854, was\r\nfought a battle between the allied English and French forces on the one\r\nside, and the Russians on the other, the former amounting to 25,000 or\r\n30,000, the latter about 60,000. The Russians began the attack at dawn\r\nof day upon the intrenched lines of the English; but after a fierce and\r\nsanguinary contest of many hours, inflicting great loss on both sides,\r\nthe Russians were finally driven from the field.\r\n\r\n=Inlist.= See ENLISTMENT.\r\n\r\n=Inlying Picket.= A body of infantry or cavalry in campaign, detailed to\r\nmarch, if called upon, and held ready for that purpose in camp or\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n=Inner.= One of the circular rings on the Creedmoor target; a shot\r\nstriking in this space counts three.\r\n\r\n=Inniskilliners=, or =Enniskilliners=. In the British service, the\r\nofficers and soldiers of the 6th Dragoons and the 27th Foot are so\r\ncalled, from the two regiments having been originally raised at\r\nEnniskillen (or Inniskillen), a town of Ulster, where the inhabitants\r\ndistinguished themselves in favor of King William against James II.\r\n\r\n=Innuit.= A name given by some ethnologists to the Indian races\r\ninhabiting the northwestern coast of North America. They differ in many\r\nrespects from the Indians of the interior and farther south. The Aleuts\r\nand Esquimos are not included in the term.\r\n\r\n=Inofficial.= Not official; not proceeding from the proper officer; not\r\nclothed with the usual forms of authority, or not done in an official\r\ncharacter; not required by or appropriate to the duties of any office;\r\nas, inofficial intelligence.\r\n\r\n=Inquiry, Board of.= A term used in contradistinction to a\r\ncourt-martial, to signify the meeting of a certain number of officers\r\n(who are not sworn) for the purpose of ascertaining facts that may\r\nafterwards become a matter of investigation on oath. There are also\r\ncourts of inquiry; such courts in the armies of Europe, it would seem,\r\nderived their origin from the prerogative of the sovereign, and became\r\npart of the military judicature by custom and not by express law. From\r\nthis fact it has been considered that the exercise of this authority,\r\ninstead of being regarded as an assumption of power, is a favor to the\r\naccused, and it is thus stated by Capt. Simmons in his work on\r\ncourts-martial. For the army of the United States, courts of inquiry\r\nhave been specially authorized by legal enactment. (See APPENDIX,\r\nARTICLES OF WAR, 115 to 121.) The origin and purposes of such courts\r\nwould naturally lead to the conclusion that they are of the essence of\r\nhigh command; and therefore the right to convoke them, under all the\r\nlegal restrictions, is properly confined to the President of the United\r\nStates, a general commanding an army, or a colonel commanding a\r\ndepartment; and in the cases of enlisted men, the commanding officer of\r\nthe regiment. See COURT OF INQUIRY.\r\n\r\n=Inroad.= The entrance of an enemy into a country with purposes of\r\nhostility; a sudden or desultory incursion or invasion; attack;\r\nencroachment.\r\n\r\n=Inroll.= See ENROLL.\r\n\r\n=Insconced.= In the military art, when any part of an army has fortified\r\nitself with a sconce, or small work, in order to defend some pass, etc.,\r\nit is said to be insconced. See ENSCONCE.\r\n\r\n=Inscribe.= To mark with letters, characters, or words, as, to inscribe\r\nthe name of the battle on their colors.\r\n\r\n=Insecure.= Not effectually guarded or protected; unsafe; exposed to\r\ndanger or loss.\r\n\r\n=Inspect.= To view and examine officially; as, troops, arms, etc.\r\n\r\n=Inspection.= A strict examination; a close survey. It is of various\r\nkinds, and embraces general, regimental, and troop or company duties. A\r\ngeneral inspection is made from time to time by inspectors-general\r\ndesignated by the commanding generals of military divisions or\r\ndepartments. Every regiment on this occasion is minutely looked into,\r\nand a faithful account is delivered by each commanding officer of the\r\nactual state of his regiment. The interior economy of the corps is not\r\nonly investigated, but the discipline of the men is likewise examined.\r\n\r\n=Inspection of Cannon, Instruments for.= These are used to verify the\r\ndimensions of cannon, and to detect the presence and measure the size of\r\ncavities in the metal. The _star-gauge_ is an instrument for measuring\r\nthe diameter of the bore at any point. The _cylinder-staff_ is used to\r\nmeasure the length of the bore. It is supported by a rest of a T-form at\r\nthe muzzle, and the extremity inserted in the gun is armed with a\r\n_measuring-point_ and a _guide-plate_. The _cylinder-gauge_ is a\r\ncylinder of cast iron, turned to the exact or true diameter of the bore.\r\nWhen used it is attached to the end of the cylinder-staff. The\r\n_searcher_ consists of four flat springs turned up at the end, and\r\nattached to a socket which is screwed on to the end of the\r\ncylinder-staff. It is used to feel for cavities in the surface of the\r\nbore. The _trunnion-gauge_ verifies the diameters of the trunnions and\r\nrimbases. The _trunnion-square_ is used to verify the position of the\r\ntrunnions with regard to the bore. The _trunnion-rule_ measures the\r\ndistance of the trunnions from the rear of the base-ring. _Calipers_,\r\nfor measuring exterior diameters. A _standard-rule_, for verifying other\r\ninstruments. The _vent-gauges_ are two pointed pieces of steel wire,\r\n0.005 inch greater and less than the true diameter of the vent, to\r\nverify its size. The _vent-searcher_ is a hooked wire, used to detect\r\ncavities in the vent. A _rammer-head_, shaped to the form of the bottom\r\nof the bore, and furnished with a staff, is used to ascertain the\r\ninterior position of the vent. A _wooden rule_, to measure exterior\r\nlengths. A _mirror_, a _wax taper_, _beeswax_; _rammer_, _sponge_, and\r\n_priming-wire_. _Figure_ and _letter-stamps_, to affix the required\r\nmarks. The objects of inspecting cannon are to verify their dimensions,\r\nparticularly those which affect the accuracy of the fire, and the\r\nrelation of the piece to its carriage, and to detect any defects of\r\nmetal and workmanship that would be likely to impair their strength and\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\n=Inspection of Projectiles.= The principal points to be observed in\r\ninspecting shot and shells are, to see that they are of proper size in\r\nall their parts; that they are made of suitable metal; and that they\r\nhave no defects, concealed or otherwise, which will endanger their use\r\nor impair the accuracy of their fire.\r\n\r\n_Inspection of Shot._--The instruments are one _large_ and one _small_\r\ngauge, and one _cylinder-gauge_; the cylinder-gauge has the same\r\ndiameter as the large gauge; it is made of cast iron, and is 5 calibers\r\nlong. There are also, one _hammer_ with a conical point, six _steel\r\npunches_, and one _searcher_ made of wire. The shot should be inspected\r\nbefore they become rusty; after being well cleaned each shot is placed\r\non a table and examined by the eye, to see that its surface is smooth\r\nand that the metal is sound and free from seams, flaws, and blisters. If\r\ncavities or small holes appear on the surface, strike the point of the\r\nhammer or punch into them, and ascertain their depth with the searcher;\r\nif the depth of the cavity exceeds 0.2 inch, the shot is rejected; and\r\nalso if it appears that an attempt has been made to conceal such defects\r\nby filling them up with nails, cement, etc. The shot must pass in every\r\ndirection through the large gauge, and not at all through the small one;\r\nthe founder should endeavor to bring the shot up as near as possible to\r\nthe _large gauge_, or to the true diameter. After having been thus\r\nexamined the shot are passed through the _cylinder-gauge_, which is\r\nplaced in an inclined position, and turned from time to time to prevent\r\nits being worn into furrows; _shot_ which _slide_ or _stick_ in the\r\ncylinder are rejected. Shot are proved by dropping them from a height of\r\n20 feet on a block of iron, or rolling them down an inclined plane of\r\nthat height against another shot at the bottom of the plane. The average\r\nweight of the shot is deduced from that of three parcels of 20 to 50\r\neach, taken indiscriminately from the pile; some of those which appear\r\nto be the smallest should also be weighed, and they are rejected if they\r\nfall short of the weight expressed by their caliber more than\r\n_one-thirty-second_ part. They almost invariably exceed that weight.\r\n\r\n_Inspection of Grape- and Canister-shot._--The dimensions are verified\r\nby means of a large and small gauge attached to the same handle. The\r\nsurface of the shot should be smooth and free from seams.\r\n\r\n_Inspection of Hollow Projectiles._--The inspecting instruments are a\r\n_large_ and _small gauge_ for each caliber, and a _cylinder-gauge_ for\r\nshells of 8 inches and under. _Calipers_ for measuring the thickness of\r\nshells at the sides. _Calipers_ to measure the thickness at the bottom.\r\n_Gauges_ to verify the dimensions of the fuze-hole and the thickness of\r\nthe metal at the fuze-hole. A _pair of hand-bellows_; a _wooden plug_ to\r\nfit the fuze-hole, and bored through to fit the nozzle of the bellows. A\r\n_hammer_, a _searcher_, a _cold chisel_, _steel punches_.\r\n\r\n_Inspection._--The surface of the shell and its exterior dimensions are\r\nexamined as in the case of shot. The shell is next struck with the\r\nhammer, to judge by the sound whether it is free from cracks; the\r\nposition and dimensions of the ears are verified; the thickness of the\r\nmetal is then measured at several points on the great circle\r\nperpendicular to the axis of the fuze-hole. The diameter of the\r\nfuze-hole, which should be accurately reamed, is then verified, and the\r\nsoundness of the metal about the inside of the hole is ascertained by\r\ninserting the finger. The shell is now placed on a trivet, in a tub\r\ncontaining water deep enough to cover it nearly to the fuze-hole; the\r\nbellows and plug are inserted into the fuze-hole, and the air forced\r\ninto the shell; if there be any holes in the shell, the air will rise in\r\nbubbles through the water. This test gives another indication of the\r\nsoundness of the metal, as the parts containing cavities will dry more\r\nslowly than other parts. The mean weight of shells is ascertained in the\r\nsame manner as that of shot. Shot and shells rejected in the inspection\r\nare marked with an X made with a cold chisel,--on shot near the gate,\r\nand on shells near the fuze-hole.\r\n\r\n=Inspector-General.= A staff-officer of an army, whose duties are those\r\nof inspection, and embrace everything relative to organization,\r\nrecruiting, discharge, administration, accountability for money and\r\nproperty, instruction, police, and discipline. In the French army, a\r\ncertain number of general officers are annually designated to make\r\ninspections.\r\n\r\n=Inspector-General of the Cavalry.= In the British service, a general\r\nofficer whose particular duty is to inspect all cavalry regiments, to\r\nreport the state of the horses, and to receive specific accounts from\r\nthe different corps of their actual state. He communicates directly and\r\nconfidentially with the commander-in-chief. Inspector-general of the\r\nrecruiting service is an officer of rank, through whom the\r\nfield-officers of districts, and colonels of regiments (when they\r\npersonally manage the recruiting service of their own corps), transmit\r\ntheir several returns to the adjutant-general’s office.\r\n\r\n=Inspector-General’s Department.= In the United States, the law provides\r\nfor one inspector-general, with the rank of brigadier-general; two\r\ninspectors-general, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel; and two with\r\nthe rank of major. Also, that the Secretary of War may, in addition,\r\ndetail officers of the line, not to exceed four, to act as\r\ninspectors-general.\r\n\r\n=Installation.= The act of investing any one with a military order.\r\n\r\n=Instruction.= The education or training of soldiers in military duties.\r\nIn the U. S. service the colonel has general charge of the instruction\r\nof his regiment.\r\n\r\n=Instructions.= Military directions or orders.\r\n\r\n=Instruments, Military Musical.= The instruments which are peculiar to\r\nthe cavalry of most nations are the trumpet and bugle. In France,\r\ndragoon regiments in general formerly adopted the drum in common with\r\nthe infantry; they now use the trumpet for garrison, and the bugle for\r\nfield service. A certain number of fifers are likewise allowed in foot\r\nregiments. In the U. S. army, the drum, fife, and bugle are used by\r\nfoot, and the trumpet by mounted troops. There is allowed a band of\r\nmusicians to each regiment, which usually serve at regimental\r\nheadquarters, and is partly maintained by the regimental fund. (See\r\nFUND.) There is also a band employed at the West Point Military Academy,\r\nwhich is maintained by the government. In the U. S. navy there is a band\r\nallowed to each commander-in-chief of a fleet, which is also maintained\r\nby the general government.\r\n\r\n=Instruments, Warlike Musical.= The Turks made use of wind and clashing\r\ninstruments of different shapes and sizes; all, except one wind\r\ninstrument, are better calculated for pomp and ceremony, than adapted to\r\nmilitary service. The clashing instruments, which the French call\r\n_instrumens à choc_, consist of two sorts of drums, and an instrument\r\nwhich is made of two plates of metal. Their wind instruments consist of\r\na winding or crooked trumpet, and of a wooden fife. The big drum which\r\nthey call _daul_, stands 3 feet high. It is carried by a mounted\r\ndrummer, who makes use of a thick stick, with which he strikes the upper\r\npart, and a small one, with which he plays upon the lower part; these he\r\napplies alternately, with much dexterity of hand and great gravity of\r\ncountenance. This is the only instrument which the Turks use in military\r\nexercises or manœuvres, and is constantly beaten when the enemy is near,\r\nand round all the outposts, in order to keep the sentinels on the alert.\r\nOn these occasions the drummer exclaims with a loud voice, _Jagda\r\nAllah!_ that is, “God is good!”\r\n\r\n=Insubjection.= Want of subjection; state of disobedience to government.\r\n\r\n=Insubmission.= Want of submission; disobedience.\r\n\r\n=Insubordinate.= Not submissive; not submitting to authority.\r\n\r\n=Insubordination.= The quality of being insubordinate; want of\r\nsubordination; disorder; disobedience to lawful authority; a serious\r\nmilitary offense.\r\n\r\n=Insubres.= A Gallic people, who crossed the Alps, and settled in Gallia\r\nTranspadana, in the north of Italy. Next to the Boii, they were the most\r\npowerful and warlike of the Gallic tribes in Cisalpine Gaul. They were\r\nconquered by the Romans shortly before the commencement of the second\r\nPunic war.\r\n\r\n=Insufficiency.= The quality of being insufficient; want of sufficiency;\r\ndeficiency; inadequateness; as, the insufficiency of provisions for a\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\n=Insult, To.= In a military sense, is to attack boldly and in open day,\r\nwithout going through the slow operations of trenches, working by mines\r\nand saps, or having recourse to those usual forms of war, by advancing\r\ngradually towards the object in view. An enemy is said to insult a coast\r\nwhen he suddenly appears upon it, and debarks troops with an immediate\r\npurpose to attack.\r\n\r\n=Insurgents.= Soldiers or people generally in a state of insurrection.\r\nThe term, however, admits of one exception. Hungarian insurgents\r\n(_Insurgenten die Ungarischen_) mean the Hungarian militia, called out\r\nor summoned by general proclamation, as under the old feudal system.\r\n\r\n=Insurrection.= A rising against civil or political authority; the open\r\nand active opposition of a number of persons to the execution of law in\r\na city or state; a rebellion; a revolt.\r\n\r\n=Intenable.= Incapable of being held; untenable; not defensible; as, an\r\nintenable fortress.\r\n\r\n=Intendant=, or =Intendant Militaire=. An officer in the French army\r\ncharged with the organization and direction of all the civil services\r\nattending a force in the field. The officers acting under his orders are\r\nthose in charge of all the finance services, the provisions, stores,\r\nhospitals, artillery train, and transport departments, besides the\r\ninterpreters, guides, and such like temporary services. The\r\n_intendant-en-chef_ of an army is the representative of the minister of\r\nwar; and, short of superseding the general’s orders, can exercise, in\r\ncase of need, all the functions of that high officer of state. The\r\nintendance is divided into intendants, ranking with general officers,\r\nsub-intendants with colonels, and assistant-intendants with majors;\r\nbesides these there are cadets, who receive no pay, and constitute a\r\nprobationary grade.\r\n\r\n=Intercept.= To interrupt communication with, or progress towards; to\r\ncut off; as, to intercept the march of an army.\r\n\r\n=Intercombat.= A combat between.\r\n\r\n=Interior.= A word of varied application; as, the _interior flanking\r\nangle_ is formed by the curtain and line of defense. _Interior radius_\r\nis that part of an _oblique radius_ extending from the centre of the\r\npolygon to the centre of the bastion. _Interior side_ is the line of the\r\ncurtain produced to the two oblique radii of the front, or a line drawn\r\nfrom the centre of one bastion to that of the next.\r\n\r\n=Interior Form of Cannon.= The interior of cannon may be divided into\r\nthree distinct parts: 1st, the _vent_, or channel which communicates\r\nfire to the charge; 2d, the _seat of the charge_, or chamber, if its\r\ndiameter be different from the rest of the bore; 3d, the _cylinder_, or\r\nthat portion of the bore passed over by the projectile. See also GROOVES\r\nFOR RIFLE CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Interior Guards.= Are police guards, guards of property, etc., who are\r\nliable to come in contact with the enemy.\r\n\r\n=Interior Slope.= Is the inclination towards the inner part of a work\r\nwhich is given to the earth forming the rampart or parapet. _Interior\r\ncrest_ is the crest of the interior slope.\r\n\r\n=Interval.= In military dispositions and manœuvres, any given distance\r\nor space. In tactics the term is used to signify taken parallel to the\r\nfront, as opposed to distance or space perpendicularly to the front.\r\n_Interval between two battalions_ is the space which separates them when\r\nthey are drawn up for action or when they are encamped. This space is\r\ngenerally wide enough to admit the march of another regiment; that is to\r\nsay, it is equal to the extent of its front when in line. _Interval\r\nbetween the line and the camp_ comprehends the space which lies between\r\nthe camp and the line of intrenchments. It is generally from 180 to 200\r\ntoises in breadth; so that the different sections of troops which are\r\nnecessary for the security of the camp, may have room to move in, while\r\nsufficient ground is left in rear for troops to pass and repass as\r\noccasion may require. The same observation holds good with respect to\r\ncontrevallation.\r\n\r\n=Intrench.= Is to make secure against the attack of an enemy by digging\r\na ditch or trench, etc. _To intrench upon_, to invade, to make\r\nencroachments upon the property or territories of another.\r\n\r\n=Intrenched Camp.= A large space capable of containing an entire army,\r\nsurrounded by works of fortification. Frequently an intrenched camp\r\njoins a fortress, in which case it is protected by permanent works of\r\nconsiderable strength--detached forts, for instance.\r\n\r\n=Intrenching Tool.= An implement used for intrenching. In view of the\r\ndeadly fire of modern small-arms it is a matter of great importance that\r\nthe soldier should be able to get cover. For this reason it has been\r\nproposed to make an intrenching tool a part of the soldier’s equipment.\r\nIn the United States army a combination bayonet and intrenching tool is\r\nused. See TROWEL BAYONET.\r\n\r\n=Intrenchment.= Is generally a ditch or trench with a parapet. The earth\r\nremoved to form the ditch is used to construct the parapet. Fascines,\r\nwith earth thrown over them, gabions, hogsheads, or bags filled with\r\nearth, are often employed to revet or strengthen the work when the earth\r\nis loose or sandy. _Intrenchments of armies_ are the whole works or\r\nobstacles by which an army or large body of troops cover themselves for\r\ntheir defense.\r\n\r\n=Intrepidity.= An unqualified contempt of death; an indifference to\r\nfortune as far as it regards personal safety; a fearlessness of heart,\r\nand a daring enterprise of mind.\r\n\r\n=Inundation.= The act of letting water into a country so that it shall\r\nbe overflowed, to prevent the approach of an enemy. It is among the most\r\nconsiderable of the various methods which have been devised for\r\nimpeding the approach to a field-work, or indeed, any fortification.\r\n\r\n=Invade, To.= To make a forcible or clandestine entry into the territory\r\nof another state; to pass the regular line of frontier of any country,\r\nin order to take possession of the interior.\r\n\r\n=Invalid.= A soldier who has been wounded, or has suffered in his\r\nhealth, and in consequence of his good conduct has been recommended to a\r\ncertain provision for life. Chelsea Hospital is the place allotted for\r\nthe reception of such objects of public gratitude and benevolence in\r\nEngland; the Soldiers’ Home, in Washington, D.

In 795, 802, 806, 825, and 986 the island was ravaged by\r\nNorsemen, by whom its monks were martyred in the three latter dates.\r\n\r\n=Ionia.= In Asia Minor. About 1040 B.C., the Iones, a Pelasgic race,\r\nemigrated from Greece, and settled here and on the adjoining islands.\r\nThey were conquered by the great Cyrus about 548 B.C.; revolted in 504,\r\nbut were again subdued. After the victories of Cimon, Ionia became\r\nindependent and remained so till 387, when it was once more subjected to\r\nPersia. It formed part of the dominions of Alexander and his successors;\r\nwas annexed to the Roman empire, and conquered by the Turks.\r\n\r\n=Ionian Islands.= A group of islands running round the west coast of\r\nEpirus, and west and south of Greece. After the division of the Roman\r\nempire these islands were included in the eastern half, and so continued\r\ntill 1081, when the Duke of Calabria took possession of them. From this\r\ntime they underwent a continual change of masters till the commencement\r\nof the 15th century, when they by degrees came into possession of the\r\nVenetians, who in 1797 ceded them to France. They were seized by Russia\r\nand Turkey in 1800, by France in 1807, by Great Britain in 1809, and\r\nNovember 15, 1815, they were formed into a republic under the\r\nprotectorate of the latter power. In May, 1864, they were formally\r\nannexed to Greece.\r\n\r\n=Ionie Indians.= A tribe of aborigines allied to the Caddos, who resided\r\nin Texas, and were generally peaceable and friendly.\r\n\r\n=Iowa.= One of the Central States of the United States, lying between\r\nthe Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. It originally formed a portion of\r\nthe Louisiana Territory; and permanent settlements commenced to be\r\nformed in it about 1833; organized as a Territory in 1838, and admitted\r\nas a State in 1846. During the civil war it contributed its full quota\r\nof troops to the cause of the Union.\r\n\r\n=Iowa Indians.= A tribe of aborigines of Dakota stock, who inhabited the\r\nState which now bears their name. They were closely allied to the Sacs\r\nand Foxes.\r\n\r\n=Ipsara=, or =Psara=. A small island in the Grecian Archipelago, west of\r\nScio; belongs to Turkey. It was taken by the Turks in 1824.\r\n\r\n=Ipsus.= A town of Phrygia, in Asia Minor.

This town was destroyed by the Danes about 1000.\r\n\r\n=Ireland.= Anciently named _Ierne_ and _Hibernia_, is said to have been\r\nfirst colonized by Phœnicians. Some assert that Partholani landed in\r\nIreland about 2048 B.C.; that the descent of the Damnonii was made about\r\n1403 B.C.; and that this was followed by the descent of Herber and\r\nHeremon, Milesian princes, from Galicia, Spain, who conquered Ireland,\r\nand gave to the throne 171 kings. The Danes and Normans invaded Ireland\r\nin 795; but were totally defeated by Brian Boriomhe at Clontarf, April\r\n23, 1014. In 1172, King Henry II. of England invaded Ireland with a\r\nformidable armament, and received homage from several of the minor\r\nnative chiefs, and from the chief Norman adventurers, granting to the\r\nlatter charters authorizing them, as his subjects, to take possession of\r\nthe entire island in his name; which they partially succeeded in\r\naccomplishing. Subsequently the authority of the English crown became\r\nlimited to a few towns on the coast, and the district termed “the Pale,”\r\ncomprising a small circuit about Dublin and Drogheda. Henry II. received\r\nthe title of “king of Ireland” in 1541, by an act passed by the\r\nAnglo-Irish Parliament in Dublin; and about the same period, some of the\r\nnative princes were induced to acknowledge him as their sovereign, and\r\nto accept peerages. The attempts of the English government to introduce\r\nthe reformed faith stirred up dissensions in Ireland. Among the first to\r\nrevolt was the Earl of Desmond, after whose death, in 1583, his vast\r\nestates in Munster were parceled out to English settlers. Soon after the\r\nchief clans of Ulster took up arms; and in opposing them, the forces of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, commanded by officers of high military reputation,\r\nencountered many reverses, the most serious of which was that in 1598 at\r\nthe battle of the Yellow Ford, where the English army was routed and its\r\ngeneral slain. Philip III. of Spain, at the solicitation of the Irish\r\nchief, dispatched a body of troops to their assistance in 1601, which\r\nlanded in the extreme south, instead of in the north, as had been\r\nexpected, were unable to effect anything, and were constrained, to\r\nsurrender. Although Elizabeth was supported by numbers of native Irish,\r\nthe northern chiefs, O’Neill and O’Donnell, held out till the queen’s\r\ngovernment came to terms with them in 1603, recognizing them as earls of\r\nTyrone and Tirconnell. In 1608 these noblemen having apprehensions for\r\ntheir personal safety quitted Ireland, and retired to the continent.\r\nTheir withdrawal enabled James I. to carry out that project of parceling\r\nout the north of Ireland to Protestant Scotch and English settlers. The\r\nIrish took advantage of the contentions in England to rise in\r\ninsurrection (1641) and massacre the Protestants. It is believed that\r\nnearly 40,000 fell victims to their fury. The country continued in a\r\nstate of anarchy till 1649. when Cromwell overran it. At the revolution\r\nthe native Irish generally took the part of James II., the English and\r\nScotch “colonists” that of William and Mary; and the war was kept up for\r\nfour years (1688-1692). The Irish again rebelled in 1798, and were not\r\nsuppressed until 1800. Ireland was incorporated with England and\r\nScotland in 1801. Several insurrections have taken place since the\r\nlatter date but were quickly suppressed. For important military events\r\nin Ireland, see separate articles.\r\n\r\n=Irish Brigade.= A body of men who followed the fortunes of James II.,\r\nand were formed into regiments under the monarchy of France.\r\n\r\n=Iron Cross.= A Prussian order of knighthood, instituted on March 10,\r\n1813, by Frederick William III., and conferred for distinguished\r\nservices in the war which was then being carried on. The decoration is\r\nan iron cross with silver mounting. The grand cross, a cross of double\r\nthe size, was presented exclusively for the gaining of a decisive\r\nbattle, or the capture or brave defense of a fortress. It was revived by\r\nWilliam I. in the Franco-Prussian war, and awarded by him to his son for\r\nhis victory at Weissembourg, August 4, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Iron Crown.= The crown of the ancient Lombard kings; is a broad band of\r\ngold set with jewels, within which is a thin plate or fillet of iron,\r\nand is declared by tradition to have been hammered from one of the nails\r\nof the true cross. It has been used at the coronation of 34 different\r\nmonarchs, including Charlemagne, Henry VII. of Germany, Charles V., and\r\nNapoleon. After the peace of Vienna in 1866, the crown was presented by\r\nthe emperor of Austria to Victor Emmanuel, king of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Iron Ores.= _Character of Pig-iron._--Ores suitable for “gun-metal”\r\nshould be reduced in the smelting-furnace, with charcoal and the warm\r\nblast, varying from 125° to 300° Fahr., depending upon the ore used.\r\nIron thus made, or pig-iron, should be soft, yielding easily to the file\r\nand chisel; the appearance of the fracture should be uniform, with a\r\nbrilliant aspect, dark gray color, and medium-sized crystals. _Character\r\nof Gun-metal._--When remelted and cast into cannon, it should approach\r\nthat degree of hardness which resists the file and chisel, but not so\r\nhard as to be bored and turned with much difficulty.

Also pulverulent and\r\nearthy. Color, dark steel-gray or iron-black, and often when\r\ncrystallized having a highly splendid lustre; streak-powder cherry-red\r\nor reddish-brown. The metallic varieties pass into an earthy ore of a\r\nred color, having none of the external characters of the crystals, but\r\nperfectly corresponding to them when they are pulverized, the powder\r\nthey yield being of a deep red color, and earthy or without lustre.\r\nSometimes slightly attracted by the magnet. _Limonite._--_Brown Iron\r\nOre._--Usually massive, and often with a smooth botryoidal or\r\nstalactitic surface, having a compact fibrous structure within. Also\r\nearthy. Color, dark brown to ochre-yellow; streak, yellowish-brown to\r\ndull yellow.

See FORTIFICATION, IRREGULAR.\r\n\r\n=Irregular Cavalry.= A term now almost obsolete. It applied a few years\r\nago to regiments of horsemen raised under certain conditions in the East\r\nIndies. These conditions were that each man should provide his own\r\nhorse, arms, accoutrements, and clothing, receiving in return a monthly\r\nsum, which also included his pay. To these regiments only three English\r\nofficers were appointed, the other officers being natives. These\r\nregiments are still paid in the same way, but they are clothed, armed,\r\nand equipped in a uniform manner; the number of British officers is\r\nincreased, and they are no longer styled irregular cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Irregularity.= A violation of the customs of service,--a delinquency\r\nwhich is subject to censure but not serious enough to be brought before\r\na court-martial.\r\n\r\n=Irun.= A town of Spain, near the left bank of the Bidassoa.

The\r\nRomans surrounded Isauria with a chain of fortresses, but the Isaurians\r\nbroke through them and remained as untamable as before. Under the\r\nempire, army after army was sent against Isauria, which stood to Rome,\r\nand afterwards to Constantinople, very much in the relation that\r\nCircassia now does to Russia. In the 8th century their national vanity\r\nwas gratified by a countryman of their own being appointed to the\r\nthrone. From this date they gradually ceased to be formidable.\r\n\r\n=Ischia.= An island in the Gulf of Naples, 6 miles from the coast, and\r\n17 miles west from Naples. In 1807, Ischia was taken by a British and\r\nSicilian force.\r\n\r\n=Isernia.= A place in Southern Italy, on the west slope of the\r\nApennines, where the Sardinian general Cialdini defeated the\r\nNeapolitans, October 17, 1860.\r\n\r\n=Isle of France.= See MAURITIUS.\r\n\r\n=Ismail=, or =Ismailov=.

It remained in the possession of Russia until 1856, when it was\r\nrestored to Turkey by the removal of the Russian frontier.\r\n\r\n=Isolé= (_Fr._). This word is used among the French, to express any body\r\nor thing which is detached from another. It is variously applied in\r\nfortification. Thus a pavilion or a barrack which is not joined to any\r\nother wall or building is called isolé, because it stands alone, and a\r\nperson may walk entirely round it. A parapet is also said to be isolé\r\nwhen there is an interval of 4 or 5 feet existing between the rampart\r\nand its wall; which interval serves as a path for the rounds.\r\n\r\n=Ispahan.= A famous city of Persia, capital of the province of\r\nIrak-Ajemi, situated on the Zendarud.

Here too was fought (194 A.D.), the bloody battle between Septimus\r\nSeverus and Pescennius Niger, by virtue of which the former became sole\r\nmaster of the Roman empire. The exact site of Issus has not yet been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n=Istalif.= A town of Afghanistan, province of Cabul (Cabool). It was\r\ntaken and partly destroyed by the British in 1842.\r\n\r\n=Italy.= A peninsula in the south of Europe. The invading Pelasgians\r\nfrom Greece, and the aborigines (Umbrians, Oscans, and Etruscans),\r\ncombined, formed the renowned Latin race still possessing the southern\r\npart of Europe. The history of Italy is soon absorbed into that of Rome,\r\nfounded 753 B.C. Previous to the 15th century it was desolated by\r\nintestine wars and the interference of the German emperors; since then,\r\nSpain, France, and Germany have struggled for the possession of the\r\ncountry, which has been divided among them several times. Spain\r\npredominated in Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries; but was\r\ncompelled to yield to the house of Austria at the beginning of the 18th\r\ncentury. The victories of Bonaparte in 1797-98 changed the government of\r\nItaly; but the Austrian rule was re-established at the peace of 1814. In\r\n1848 the Milanese and Venetians revolted and joined Piedmont, but were\r\nsubdued by Radetzky. The hostile feeling between Austria and Piedmont\r\ngradually increased till war broke out in April, 1859, in which the\r\nAustrians were defeated, and the kingdom of Italy was re-established in\r\n1861. Another war with Austria was declared in June, 1866, but peace was\r\nsigned in October, same year, and Venetia was ceded to Italy. For other\r\ndetails, see ROME and the various Italian cities throughout this volume.\r\n\r\n=Ithome.= A mountain fortress of Messenia, memorable for the defense\r\nthere made for many years against the Spartans in the first Messenian\r\nwar.

The Swiss fought for ten hours, slew three times their number\r\nof the enemy, but were themselves cut off to 10 men. This battle is\r\nknown as the “Swiss Thermopylæ.”\r\n\r\n=Jacobins.= One of those clubs which played so conspicuous a part in the\r\nfirst French revolution. In 1792 they took the name of “The Society of\r\nthe Friends of Liberty and Equality.” Immediately after the fall of the\r\nking, the Jacobins began that struggle against the Girondists which\r\nended in the destruction of the latter. After the fall of Robespierre\r\nduring the Convention they rapidly lost influence, and were at last\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\n=Jacobites.= This name was given to those who, at the English revolution\r\nin 1688, adhered to the cause of the dethroned James II.

The immediate occasion of it\r\nwas the enormities perpetrated by Charles the Bad, king of Navarre, and\r\nhis adherents; but it was really caused by long-continued oppression on\r\nthe part of the nobles. Suddenly rising against their lords, the\r\npeasants laid hundreds of castles in ruins, murdered the nobles, and\r\nviolated their wives and daughters, practicing every enormity, and\r\nacting, as they said, on the principle of doing as had been done to\r\nthem. For some weeks they were successful; but the magnitude of the\r\ndanger induced the nobles to make common cause against them, and on June\r\n9 the peasants were defeated with great slaughter near Meaux by Captal\r\nde Buch and Count of Foix. This put an end to the insurrection.\r\n\r\n=Jade= (_Fr._). A very hard stone, of an olive color, from which the\r\nhandles of swords and sabres are manufactured in Poland and Turkey.\r\n\r\n=Jaen.= Formerly an independent Moorish kingdom; is now a province of\r\nSpain.

A town of Asiatic Turkey, in the province\r\nof Syria, on the Mediterranean. This place attained its greatest\r\nprosperity in the times of the Crusaders, when it became the principal\r\nlanding-place of the warriors of Christendom. In 1799 it was stormed by\r\nthe French under Bonaparte, and here was perpetrated his shameful\r\nmassacre of Turkish prisoners. In 1832, Mohammed Ali made himself master\r\nof it; but the Turks, with the assistance of the British and Austrians,\r\ntook it from him again in 1840.\r\n\r\n=Jaffna=, or =Jaffnapatam=.

In 1655 it was taken by the English, when 3000 British\r\nsoldiers who had served in the Parliamentary army settled there. In\r\n1866 a revolt of a large portion of the negro population took place,\r\nwhich was promptly suppressed.\r\n\r\n=Jamb.= To squeeze tight.\r\n\r\n=Jambeaux=, or =Jambes= (_Fr._).

Its object\r\nwas to put a stop to the incursions of the Moors; these knights obliging\r\nthemselves by a vow to secure the roads. The highest dignity in that\r\norder is that of grand master, which has been united to the crown of\r\nSpain. The knights were obliged to give proof of their descent from\r\nfamilies that had been noble for four generations on both sides; they\r\nwere also required to make it appear that their ancestors were neither\r\nJews, Saracens, nor heretics, nor had ever been called into question by\r\nthe Inquisition.\r\n\r\n=James Island.= One of the sea islands of Charleston Co., S. C., having\r\nCharleston harbor and Ashley River on the north.

The first English settlement in the United States\r\nwas made at this place in 1608, but nothing now remains but a few ruins.\r\nThe forces of Wayne and Lord Cornwallis had an engagement near here in\r\n1781.\r\n\r\n=Jangar.= A kind of ponton constructed of two boats with a platform laid\r\nacross them, which is used by the natives in the East Indies to convey\r\nhorses, cattle, etc., across rivers.\r\n\r\n=Janissar-Agasi.= Commander-in-chief of the Janissaries.\r\n\r\n=Janissaries= (Turk, _ieni tcheri_, “new soldiers”). An order of\r\ninfantry in the Turkish army: originally prisoners trained to arms; were\r\nfirst organized by Orcan, about 1330, and remodeled by his son Amurath\r\nI., 1360; their numbers being increased by following sultans. In later\r\ndays they degenerated from their strict discipline, and several times\r\ndeposed the sultan. During an insurrection, June 14-15, 1826, when\r\nnearly 3000 of them were killed, the Ottoman army was reorganized, and a\r\nfirman was issued on June 17 abolishing the Janissaries.\r\n\r\n=Januarius, Order of St.= An order of knighthood founded by King Charles\r\nof Sicily (afterwards Charles III. of Spain) on July 6, 1738. It was\r\nabolished after the French invasion of 1806, and re-introduced in 1814.\r\nThe badge is a gold octagonal white and red enameled cross, with gold\r\nlilies in the upper and side angles. The obverse represents St.\r\nJanuarius in episcopal robes with an open book. The round middle of the\r\nreverse shows a golden open book, and two phials partly filled with\r\nblood. The knights are either _Cavalieri di Giustizia_, who must count\r\nfour noble generations, or _Cavalieri di Grazia_.\r\n\r\n=Japan.= An Asiatic empire, composed of Japan, or Niphon, and 3850\r\nisles, with nearly 40,000,000 inhabitants. For military events in Japan,\r\nsee separate articles in this book.\r\n\r\n=Jargeau.= A town of France, in the department Loiret, 10 miles from\r\nOrleans. This place was taken, after a short siege, by the Earl of\r\nSalisbury, in 1428.\r\n\r\n=Jarnac.= A town of France, situated on the Charente.

In 1822 it was burned by the Janissaries, from\r\nwhich disaster it has never recovered.\r\n\r\n=Jauts=, or =Jats=. A people of Hindostan, who have at different times\r\nmade some figure in its annals. The first historical mention of them\r\noccurs in the beginning of the 11th century, on the invasion of India by\r\nMahmoud the Gaznevide, when they were completely defeated and driven\r\ninto the mountainous districts of the interior of India. We find them\r\nafterwards, under the growing imbecility of Aurungzebe’s successors,\r\ncontinually extending their conquests. They suffered a reverse, however,\r\nat the hands of Ahmed Shah, the sovereign of Cabul, who invaded Northern\r\nIndia, and overran a great portion of their territory. The Jaut chief\r\nafterwards became an ally of Ahmed Shah, having treacherously betrayed\r\nhis former allies, the Mahrattas, at the battle of Paniput, January 14,\r\n1761. When the British power became predominant, the rajah of the Jauts,\r\nRungeet Sing, sought security by concluding a treaty by which he agreed\r\nto assist England against all enemies, and by this means he retained the\r\ngovernment of his territories. In 1808, however, on the defeat of Holkar\r\nby the British, he received into Bhurtpore the discomfited army. The\r\ncity was besieged, and cost the British an immense number of lives; but\r\nat length, despairing of effectual resistance, the rajah agreed to\r\ncompel Holkar to quit the place. For this breach of the terms of the\r\ntreaty he was compelled by the English to pay a heavy fine. Disputes\r\nabout the succession to the throne afterwards led to the interference\r\nof the British, and the hitherto impregnable fortress of Bhurtpore was\r\ntaken by Lord Combermere, January 18, 1826, after a desperate resistance\r\non the part of the Jauts.\r\n\r\n=Java.= A large island in the Eastern Archipelago; is said to have been\r\nreached by the Portuguese in 1511, and by the Dutch in 1595. The latter,\r\nwho now possess it, built Batavia, the capital, about 1619. The\r\natrocious massacre of 20,000 of the unarmed natives by the Dutch,\r\nsparing neither women nor children, to possess their effects, took place\r\nin 1740. The island capitulated to the British, September 18, 1811; but\r\nit was restored to Holland in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Javelin= (Lat. _pilum_). A short and light spear used for darting\r\nagainst an enemy. In the ancient Roman legions, the first and second\r\nlines were armed with them, and in those days they were considered\r\nexcellent offensive weapons.\r\n\r\n=Je Maintiendrai= (“I will maintain”). The motto of the house of Nassau.\r\nWhen William III. came to the throne of England, he continued this, but\r\nadded “the liberties of England and the Protestant religion,” at the\r\nsame time ordering that the old motto of the royal arms, “_Dieu et mon\r\ndroit_” should be retained on the great seal, 1689.\r\n\r\n=Jean de Pied de Port, St.= A town of France, in the department of the\r\nLower Pyrenees, on the Nive. Near this place is the pass of Roncevaux,\r\nor Roncesvalles, where, in 778, the army of Charlemagne was defeated,\r\nand Rolland, the distinguished Paladin, mortally wounded.\r\n\r\n=Jelalabad.= A town of Afghanistan; capital of a province of the same\r\nname, 75 miles southeast from Cabul (Cabool). It is memorable for the\r\nsuccessful resistance made there in 1841-42 by Sir Robert Sale, with a\r\nhandful of British troops against a large besieging force of Afghans.\r\nIts fortifications were destroyed by the British in 1842, when they\r\nevacuated the country.\r\n\r\n=Jeloudar.= An East Indian term, signifying to belong to the train or\r\nequipage.\r\n\r\n=Jemadar.= A native lieutenant in an Indian native infantry or cavalry\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n=Jemappes.= A village and commune of Belgium, in the province of\r\nHainault, 2 miles west from Mons. In 1792, the French under Dumouriez\r\ngained a great victory over the Austrians near this place.\r\n\r\n=Jemaulabad.= A town and fortress in the south of India, province of\r\nCanara, which was originally called Narasingha Augady. The first, which\r\nwas built by Tippoo, stands on the summit of an immense rock, which may\r\nbe deemed impregnable, as it is wholly inaccessible except by one narrow\r\nway. After the fall of Seringapatam, it sustained a siege of six weeks\r\nfrom the British, when being bombarded, it was taken, and the commander\r\nhaving poisoned himself, his principal officers were hanged. It was\r\nafterwards surprised and taken by a band of insurgents or plunderers,\r\nwhen it was reduced, after a blockade of three months, and all that did\r\nnot escape were summarily executed.\r\n\r\n=Jena.= A town of Germany, in the grand duchy Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,\r\nsituated in a romantic valley at the confluence of the Leutra with the\r\nSaale. In this vicinity was fought the great battle of Jena, October 14,\r\n1806, between the French and Prussian armies, in which the latter was\r\ntotally defeated.\r\n\r\n=Jenizer-effendi.= An appointment among the Turks, which in some degree\r\nresembles that of provost-marshal in European armies. The only functions\r\nwhich this officer is permitted to exercise are those of judge to the\r\ncompany. He sits on particular days for the purpose of hearing the\r\ncomplaints of the soldiers, and of settling their differences. If a case\r\nof peculiar difficulty should occur, he reports the case to the _Aga_,\r\nwhose opinion and determination are final.\r\n\r\n=Jericho.= Once one of the most flourishing cities of Palestine,\r\nsituated a few miles northeast of Jerusalem. The Israelites captured and\r\ndestroyed it on their first entry into Canaan. In the time of Herod it\r\nwas rebuilt, but was destroyed in the reign of Vespasian, and again\r\nrebuilt under Hadrian. During the Crusades, it was repeatedly captured,\r\nand at last destroyed. At the present day its place is occupied by a\r\nmiserable village called Richa.\r\n\r\n=Jersey.= One of the Channel Islands, and the largest and most southerly\r\nof the group, situated about 15 miles west from the coast of France, and\r\nbelonging to Great Britain. Various attempts have been made by the\r\nFrench to possess themselves of this island, but without success. The\r\nmost remarkable was in 1781, when they were repulsed by the local\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\n=Jerusalem.= A celebrated city of Syria, the capital of the ancient\r\nJudæa and the modern Palestine. This city was called Salem in 1913 B.C.;\r\nits king was slain by Joshua, 1451 B.C. It was taken by David, 1048\r\nB.C., who dwelt in the fort, calling it the City of David. Jerusalem was\r\ntaken by the Persians in 614; retaken by the emperor Heraclius, 628; by\r\nthe Saracens, 637; and by the Crusaders, when 70,000 infidels were put\r\nto the sword; taken by Saladin, 1187; by the Turks, who drove away the\r\nSaracens, 1217 and 1239. It was held by the French under Bonaparte,\r\nFebruary, 1799.\r\n\r\n=Jet= (_Fr._). A term signifying the motion of any body that is urged\r\nforward by main force; it likewise means the space which is gone over by\r\nany propelled body; and sometimes the instrument from which anything is\r\nthrown or shot; as, the cross-bow, etc. _Jet des bombes_ is a phrase\r\nadopted instead of _tir_, which formerly expressed the course that a\r\nshell took when it was thrown out of a mortar by the power of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n=Jets.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Jiddah=, or =Jeddah=. A trading town of the Hedjaz, Arabia, about 60\r\nmiles west from Mecca. On June 15, 1858, the inhabitants rose against\r\nthe Christians resident among them, and massacred a considerable number\r\nof them. In August of the same year the town was bombarded by the\r\nBritish, and satisfaction rendered.\r\n\r\n=Jingal=, or =Jingall=. A small, portable piece of ordnance, to be fired\r\nfrom the ground or on a wall, resting on a long, slender butt-end, and\r\ntwo legs. This piece was used in India. See GINGALS.\r\n\r\n=Joar.= An East Indian term, signifying a general massacre of the women\r\nand children, which is sometimes performed by the Hindoos, when they\r\nfind they cannot prevent the enemy from taking the town. When this\r\ndreadful and unnatural ceremony is to take place, a spot is selected\r\nwhich is filled with wood, straw, oil, etc. The victims are inclosed and\r\nthe whole is set on fire.\r\n\r\n=John (St.) of Jerusalem, Knights of.= See SAINT JOHN OF JERUSALEM, THE\r\nORDER OF THE KNIGHTS HOSPITALLERS OF.\r\n\r\n=Join.= A technical word used in the British service, signifying to\r\neffect the junction of one military body with another. In a more limited\r\nsense, it means the accession of an individual, voluntary or otherwise,\r\nto a corps or army. If an officer, on being ordered to join, omits to do\r\nso willfully, he is liable to be tried by a general court-martial, or to\r\nbe peremptorily suspended for being absent without leave.\r\n\r\n=Jooday Perraput.= An East Indian term, signifying a slave taken in war.\r\n\r\n=Jour= (_Fr._).

A public record or general orderly book, kept in the\r\nFrench service, and in which every transaction that occurred during a\r\nsiege is entered by the governor of the town, for the inspection of a\r\nsuperior authority. The general officer who carried on the siege of a\r\nplace likewise kept a document of the same kind, and minuted down\r\neverything that happened under his command. So that the journal which\r\nwas kept in this manner was a circumstantial detail of what occurred,\r\nday after day, during the attack and defense of a town.\r\n\r\n=Journals of Defense.= In the American service during war, the commander\r\nof a place, and the chiefs of engineers and of artillery, shall keep\r\njournals of defense, in which shall be entered, in order of date,\r\nwithout blank or interlineation, the orders given or received, the\r\nmanner in which they are executed, their results, and every event and\r\ncircumstance of importance in the progress of the defense. These\r\njournals shall be sent after the siege to the Department of War.\r\n\r\n=Journals of March.= Commanding officers of troops marching through a\r\ncountry little known will keep journals of their marches according to a\r\nform laid down in Army Regulations. At the end of the march a copy of\r\nthe journal will be retained at the station where the troops arrive, and\r\nthe original will be forwarded to the headquarters of the department or\r\n_corps d’armée_. Thence, after a copy has been taken, it will be\r\ntransmitted, through the headquarters of the army, to the\r\nadjutant-general, for the information of the War Department. The object\r\nof the journal is to furnish data for maps, and information which may\r\nserve for future operations. Every point of practical importance should\r\ntherefore be noted.\r\n\r\n=Journée= (_Fr._). A term used among the French to express any\r\nparticular engagement or battle; as, _la journée de Marengo_, the battle\r\nof Marengo. We frequently adopt the word in the same sense; thus, a\r\nhard-fought _day_ signifies a hard-fought _battle_.\r\n\r\n=Joust=, or =Just=. An exercise of arms and horsemanship, performed in\r\nthe Middle Ages by knights and nobles. In the joust, the combatants\r\nengaged one another singly, each against his antagonist. The weapon most\r\nin use in the joust was the lance, but sometimes the battle-axe and\r\nsword were employed. To direct the lance anywhere but at the body of the\r\nantagonist was reckoned foul play. In the joust of peace, or _joute de\r\nplaisance_, a foot encounter preceded the mounted combat.\r\n\r\n=Joute= (_Fr._). A close fight between two individuals. It likewise\r\nmeans an engagement at sea.\r\n\r\n=Joves= (_Fr._). The two sides in the epaulement of a battery which form\r\nthe embrasure are so called.\r\n\r\n=Joyeuse= (_Fr._).

He\r\nis appointed by the officer authorized to assemble a general\r\ncourt-martial, and must be relieved by the same authority. His duties\r\nare various and important (see De Hart’s “Military Law,” Benét on\r\n“Courts-Martial,” and Scott’s “Analytical Digest of Military Law,” on\r\nduties, etc., of judge-advocate); he must be present at the court for\r\nwhich he is appointed, not only to record all its proceedings, but also\r\nin order to impart validity to its jurisdiction. He advises the court on\r\npoints of law, of custom, and of form, and invites their attention to\r\nany deviation therefrom. If any question of law arises out of the\r\nproceedings, and he is called upon for his opinion, he is bound to give\r\nit. It is his duty to take care that the accused does not suffer from a\r\nwant of knowledge of the law, or from a deficiency of experience or\r\nability to solicit from witnesses, or develop by the testimony on the\r\ntrial, a full statement of the facts of the case as hearing on the\r\ndefense. If the court, or a member thereof, should deviate from the\r\nletter of the law, or assume a power at variance with it, the\r\njudge-advocate is bound to point out the error, which should become a\r\npart of the record. It is now admitted that the custom of appointing\r\npersons from civil life to officiate as judge-advocate is clearly\r\nobjectionable. It creates a ministerial officer without legal\r\nresponsibilities, and necessarily commits to his hands high interests of\r\nthe government, and to some extent the rights and reputation of\r\nindividuals, to be treated and observed without any stronger guaranty of\r\nfidelity than his own sense or impression of moral obligation. In the\r\nimportant duties of the judge-advocate as recorder, adviser, and\r\nprosecutor, the utmost deference to the dignity of the court should be\r\napparent; a delicate courtesy and modest demeanor should be\r\ncharacteristic of his address, while his argument may be replete with\r\nall the vigor and energy which knowledge imparts and which truth\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n=Judge-Advocate-General.= Of the British forces is stationed in London,\r\nand is regarded as a civil officer, and is paid from the civil\r\ndepartment. The office is generally held by an experienced barrister, to\r\nwhom all proceedings of courts-martial are referred for remarks as to\r\nlegality and regularity. In the United States he is a staff-officer with\r\nthe rank of brigadier-general, who receives, revises, and causes to be\r\nrecorded the proceedings of all courts-martial, courts of inquiry, and\r\nmilitary commissions, and has charge of the records of the bureau of\r\nmilitary justice.\r\n\r\n=Judge-Advocates, Corps of.= In the United States, consists of four\r\ngeneral staff-officers with the rank of major, who are usually assigned\r\nto duty at the headquarters of geographical divisions and departments,\r\nand may be detailed as judge-advocates of military courts.\r\n\r\n=Judge-Martial=, or =Advocate-General=. In former years was the supreme\r\njudge in martial law, as to the jurisdiction and powers of military\r\ncourts in the British system.\r\n\r\n=Junior.= One having a lower rank. When the grade is the same, the one\r\nhaving the more recent commission or warrant.\r\n\r\n=Junk-wads.= Are used for proving cannon. _Wad-molds_ for each\r\ncaliber--consisting of two cast-iron cylinders of different diameters\r\nset in oak, or of two strong pieces, strapped with iron, and joined by a\r\nhinge--are employed in their manufacture. The junk, after having been\r\npicked, is compressed by being beaten in the smaller mold with a _maul_\r\nand _cylindrical drift_--the latter nearly of the size of the\r\nmold--until it assumes the requisite dimensions; it is then taken out by\r\nraising the upper part of the mold, and closely wrapped with rope-yarn\r\npassed over it in the direction of the axis of the cylinder, and\r\nfastened by a few turns around the middle of the wad. It is then placed\r\nin the large mold, and again beaten with the maul and drift until its\r\ndiameter is increased to that of the mold; when it is taken out and its\r\ndiameter verified by a wooden gauge corresponding to the large\r\nshot-gauge of the caliber.\r\n\r\n=Jupon=, or =Just-au-Corps=. A surcoat. The name jupon is chiefly\r\napplied to the short tight form of that military garment in use in the\r\n14th century. It was a sleeveless jacket or overcoat, composed of\r\nseveral thicknesses of material sewed through, and faced with silk or\r\nvelvet, upon which were embroidered the arms of the wearer. It fitted\r\nclosely to the body, and, descending below the hips, terminated in an\r\nenriched border of various patterns.\r\n\r\n=Jurisdiction.= Legal authority; extent of power. All sutlers and\r\nretainers to the camp, and all persons whatsoever serving with the\r\narmies of the United States in the field, though not enlisted soldiers,\r\nare to be subject to orders, according to the rules and discipline of\r\nwar. To decide exactly where the boundary-line runs between civil and\r\nmilitary jurisdiction as to the civilians attached to an army is\r\ndifficult; but it is quite evident that they are within military\r\njurisdiction, as provided for in the Articles of War, when their\r\ntreachery, defection, or insubordination might endanger or embarrass the\r\narmy to which they belong in its operations against what is known in\r\nmilitary phrase as “an enemy.” Probably the fact that troops are found\r\nin a region of country chiefly inhabited by Indians, and remote from the\r\nexercise of civil authority, may enter into the description of “an army\r\nin the field.” Persons who attach themselves to an army going upon an\r\nexpedition against hostile Indians may be understood as agreeing that\r\nthey will submit themselves for the time being to military control. All\r\nofficers, conductors, gunners, matrosses, drivers, or other persons\r\nwhatsoever receiving pay or hire in the service of the artillery or\r\ncorps of engineers of the United States, shall be subject to be tried by\r\ncourts-martial. The officers and soldiers of any troops, whether militia\r\nor others, being mustered and in pay of the United States, shall, at all\r\ntimes and in all places, when joined, or acting in conjunction with the\r\nregular forces of the United States, be governed by the Rules and\r\nArticles of War, and shall be subject to be tried by courts-martial in\r\nlike manner with the officers and soldiers in the regular forces; save\r\nonly that such courts-martial shall be composed entirely of militia\r\nofficers. No officer, non-commissioned officer, soldier, or follower of\r\nthe army shall be tried the second time for the same offense. No person\r\nshall be liable to be tried and punished by a general court-martial for\r\nany offense which shall appear to have been committed more than two\r\nyears before the issuing of the order for such trial, unless the person\r\nby reason of having absented himself, or some other manifest impediment,\r\nshall not have been amenable to justice within that period. No garrison\r\nor regimental court-martial shall have the power to try capital cases,\r\nor commissioned officers; neither shall they inflict a fine exceeding\r\none month’s pay, nor imprison, nor put to hard labor any\r\nnon-commissioned officer or soldier, for a longer time than one month.\r\n\r\n=Just.= See JOUST.\r\n\r\n=Justice, Military.= That species of justice which prevails in the army,\r\nand which is administered by military tribunals in accordance with the\r\nArticles of War. In Prussia justice is frequently obtained through what\r\nis known as the court of honor.

See DENNEWITZ.\r\n\r\n=Jutland.= The only considerable peninsula of Europe that points\r\ndirectly north, forms a portion of the kingdom of Denmark, and comprises\r\nthe province of North Jutland. South Jutland was taken by the allies in\r\n1813, and restored in 1814. In historical times, the Jutes took part in\r\nthe expedition of the Saxons to England. As allies of the Saxons, they\r\nwaged war with Charlemagne, and under the name of Normans (Northmen),\r\nfrequently desolated the coasts of Germany and France.\r\n\r\n=Juzail.= A heavy rifle used by the Afghans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nK.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kabbade= (_Fr._). Military clothing of the modern Greeks; Roman\r\n_sagum_.\r\n\r\n=Kabyles.= An aboriginal African people, inhabiting the mountains of the\r\nAtlas. They are an independent race, who mainly exist by plundering the\r\npeople of the plains. They are divided into numerous tribes, each of\r\nwhich has its distinctive name, with the prefix _Beni_ before it.

The English war with the\r\nnatives of the country began in 1798, and continued with intermissions\r\nuntil March, 1853. The Kaffirs, headed by Mokanna, a prophet, attacked\r\nGrahamstown, but were repulsed with much slaughter in 1819; again\r\ndefeated in 1828, 1831, and 1834.

When a regiment\r\nmarches by files, it is almost impossible for the rear to keep up. On\r\nthis account, divisions, sub-divisions, and even sections, are best\r\ncalculated to preserve a regular depth and continuity of march. Keep up\r\nlikewise signifies to attend to the interior management and discipline\r\nof a corps, so as to prevent the least deviation from established rules\r\nand regulations. Thus commanding officers are said to keep up good order\r\nand discipline, who, whether present or absent, provide against the\r\nleast insubordination, etc. To _keep up a heavy fire_, is to play heavy\r\nordnance against a fortified place, or body of men, by a calm and\r\nwell-directed succession of shot. The term is equally applicable to a\r\nsteady fire of musketry.\r\n\r\n=Kehl.= A town of Germany, on the Rhine, opposite Strasburg.

An old abbey, now in ruins, is\r\nthe chief object of interest in Kelso. It was founded by David I. in\r\n1128, and was destroyed in 1560, after having sustained great injury at\r\nthe hands of the English in 1522 and 1545. Kelso is often mentioned in\r\nthe histories of the border wars.\r\n\r\n=Kemmendine.= A post of the Burmese empire, near Rangoon, memorable for\r\nthe various contests between the British forces and the natives in 1824.\r\n\r\n=Kenaians.= A numerous tribe of Indians residing in Alaska. They derive\r\ntheir name from the peninsula of Kenai, and are peaceable and\r\nself-supporting.\r\n\r\n=Kenilworth.= A small town of Warwickshire, England. The only interest\r\nof the place centres in its ruined castle, which stands on a rocky and\r\ncommanding eminence; it was founded by Geoffrey de Clinton, lord\r\nchamberlain to Henry I. It was granted by Henry III. to Simon do\r\nMontfort, earl of Leicester, and became the chief rallying-point of the\r\ninsurgents who sided with that noble. After his death it held out for\r\nsix months against the royal forces. The castle of Kenilworth was\r\ndismantled by Oliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\n=Kent.= A maritime county of England, forming the southeastern angle of\r\nthe kingdom, and approaching nearer to the continent than any other part\r\nof the kingdom.

Kent was the\r\nfirst kingdom of the Heptarchy established by the Saxons in Britain.\r\n\r\n=Kentucky.= One of the Central States of the Mississippi Valley, and the\r\nsecond admitted into the confederacy after the Revolution. It was\r\nformerly included in the territory of Virginia, to which it belonged\r\ntill 1792. Its name, signifying “the dark and bloody ground,” is\r\nsuggestive of its early history, it being the scene of many bloody\r\nconflicts between the settlers and Indians, and also the grand\r\nbattle-ground of the Indians themselves. The most important battle\r\nbetween the Indians and whites took place near Blue Lick Springs, August\r\n19, 1782, the latter numbering 182, and the former about three times\r\nthat number. After a desperate engagement the Kentuckians were totally\r\nrouted, with a loss of 60 killed and wounded. The celebrated Col. Boone\r\nbore a part and lost a son in this engagement. In the war of 1812\r\nKentucky was largely and effectively represented, as also in the Mexican\r\nwar. In the civil war the State at first declared a strict neutrality;\r\nbut as this condition could not be maintained, after stormy and exciting\r\ndiscussions in its councils, it declared for the Union in November,\r\n1861. As the population was almost equally divided in its sympathy,\r\nKentuckians were to be found fighting in the ranks of both contending\r\narmies. The State was the theatre of several hotly contested actions\r\nduring the civil war, and suffered considerably during that trying\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n=Kerana.= A long trumpet, similar in shape and size to the\r\nspeaking-trumpet. The Persians use it whenever they wish to make any\r\nextraordinary noise, and they frequently blow it with hautboys,\r\nkettle-drums, and other instruments, at retreat or sunset, and two hours\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\n=Kerman=, or =Sirjan=. The capital of a province of the same name in\r\nPersia, situated about 360 miles southeast from Ispahan.

It has never recovered from the\r\neffects of this great disaster.\r\n\r\n=Kern= (Ir. _cearn_). A soldier. The Irish infantry were formerly\r\ndistinguished by this appellation. The men in those days were armed with\r\na sword and a dart or javelin, which was tied to a small cord, so that\r\nafter they had thrown it at the enemy they could instantly recover it,\r\nand use it in any way they thought proper. The javelin was called\r\n_skene_, which is also the Irish for a _knife_.\r\n\r\n=Kertch= (anc. _Panticapœum_). A town of Russia, in the government of\r\nTaurida, on the coast of the Crimea. It was colonized in 500 B.C. by the\r\nMilesians, and about 50 B.C. it became part of the Roman empire; and in\r\n375 A.D. it fell into the hands of the Huns. In 1280 it was occupied by\r\nthe Genoese, who were driven out by the Turks in 1473. It was seized by\r\nthe Russians in 1771, and formally ceded to them in 1774.

This instrument, which\r\ngives forth a sharp, ringing sound, is used in Europe by regiments of\r\ncavalry and horse-artillery in lieu of the ordinary cylindrical drum,\r\nwhich would, from its shape, be inconvenient on horseback. Kettle-drums\r\nare not used in the U. S. military service.\r\n\r\n=Kettle-drum Cart.= A four-wheel carriage drawn by four horses, which\r\nwas used exclusively by the British artillery as a pageant. The ordnance\r\nflag was painted on the fore part, and the drummer, with two\r\nkettle-drums, was seated, as in a chair of state, on the back part. This\r\ncart, which is finely engraved and richly gilt, has not been in the\r\nfield since 1743, when the king was present. It is at present kept in\r\nthe Tower of London.\r\n\r\n=Kettle-drummer.= One who plays on a kettle-drum.\r\n\r\n=Kettle-hat.= A cap of iron worn by knights in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n=Key.= In artillery carriages, is a bolt used to secure cap squares and\r\nfor analogous purposes.\r\n\r\n=Key of a Position or Country.= A point the possession of which gives\r\nthe control of that position or country.\r\n\r\n=Key-chain.= A chain attached to the key to prevent it from being lost.\r\n\r\n=Key-plates.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, THE CAISSON.\r\n\r\n=Keyserlicks=, or =Imperialists=.

A _khanate_\r\nis a principality. _Khagan_ means “khan of khans,” but has seldom been\r\napplied.

It was taken by Vladimir, grand duke of Russia, in\r\n988. The city was destroyed by the Lithuanians; and the Turks found it\r\ndeserted when they took possession of the Crimea in 1475.\r\n\r\n=Khiva= (anc. _Chorasmia_), =Khaurezm=, =Kharasm=, or =Urgunge=. A\r\nkhanate of Turkestan, in Central Asia. In ancient times it was nominally\r\nsubject to the Selucidæ; subsequently it formed part of the kingdoms of\r\nBactria, Parthia, Persia, and the Caliphate, and became an independent\r\nmonarchy in 1092 under a Seljuk dynasty. The Khivans, or as they were\r\nthen called, the Khaurezmians, after conquering the whole of Persia and\r\nAfghanistan, were obliged to succumb to the Moguls, under Genghis Khan,\r\nin 1221. In 1370 it came into the hands of Timur. Timur’s descendants\r\nwere subdued in 1511 by Shahy Beg, chief of the Uzbeks, a Turkish tribe,\r\nand his successors still rule over Khiva. In 1717, Peter the Great\r\nattempted to conquer it, but his army was totally defeated; the attempt\r\nwas renewed in 1839 by the czar Nicholas, with the same result; the\r\ngreater part of the Russian army perished in the desert. From 1873 to\r\n1875, however, it was continually invaded by the armies of Russia, who\r\nin the latter year occupied a portion of the principality, which is now\r\nruled by the Russian government under the name of the Trans-Caspian\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n=Khodadaud Sircar= (_Ind._).

It is 30 miles in\r\nlength, being here and there merely a narrow ravine between almost\r\nperpendicular rocks of at least 600 feet in height. It may be said to\r\nhave been the key of the adjacent regions in either direction from the\r\ndays of Alexander the Great to the Afghan wars of 1839-42.

In 1811 and 1812, however, they again renewed\r\nhostilities, and attacked Fort Harrison in the latter year. Being\r\nrepulsed, they surprised and murdered 20 persons at the mouth of White\r\nRiver. For this and similar atrocities they were punished by the burning\r\nof some of their villages. After a desultory warfare, treaties of peace\r\nwere again concluded with them, and after the treaty of 1819 they sold\r\ntheir lands and moved beyond the Mississippi River. A few settled down\r\nto agriculture, and their descendants now exhibit considerable\r\nindications of civilization; but the greater number roamed over the\r\ncountry committing depredations. Some of them are now settled on the\r\nKansas agency, Kansas, and others on the Sac and Fox agency, in Indian\r\nTerritory.

The invaders were joined by the Irish\r\ninsurgents, and the battles of Castlebar and Colooney followed; and the\r\nFrench were defeated at Ballinamuck, September 8 of the same year.\r\n\r\n=Killaloe.= A town of Ireland, in the county Clare, 12 miles northeast\r\nof Limerick. This town was long the royal seat of the O’Briens; and at\r\nKincora, about a mile to the north, are pointed out some remains of the\r\nresidence. At Killaloe, in 1691, Gen. Sarsfield intercepted the\r\nartillery of William III. on its way to Limerick.\r\n\r\n=Killese.= The groove in a cross-bow.\r\n\r\n=Killiecrankie.= A famous pass through the Grampian Mountains, in\r\nPerthshire, Scotland, 15 miles northwest of Dunkeld. At the northwest\r\nextremity of this pass a battle was fought in 1689, between the\r\nrevolutionary army under Gen. Mackay, and the royalists under J. C.\r\nGraham of Claverhouse, viscount Dundee, in which the former was\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n=Kilmainham Hospital.= An asylum in Dublin, Ireland, for aged and\r\ndisabled soldiers. It was founded by Arthur, earl of Granard,\r\nmarshal-general of the army in Ireland, 1675. The appointments to this\r\nplace are in the gift of the commander-in-chief of the army, who selects\r\nthem from the old half-pay officers. The expense of the institution to\r\nthe country is £8000 per annum.\r\n\r\n=Kilmallock.= A town of Ireland, in the county Limerick. It was\r\ninvested by the Irish forces in 1598, but the siege was raised by the\r\nDuke of Ormond. There was much fighting done here in 1641 and 1642.\r\nKilmallock police barrack was attacked by 200 armed Fenians on March 5,\r\n1867; the barrack was defended for three hours by 14 police constables,\r\nwho finally drove off the Fenians, with loss, by a sally.\r\n\r\n=Kilsyth.= A village of Scotland, in Stirlingshire, 13 miles southwest\r\nfrom Stirling.

On October 18, the\r\nRussians blew up Oczakoff, a fort opposite.\r\n\r\n=Kindle.= In a military sense, to kindle is to excite to arms; to excite\r\nmilitary ardor.\r\n\r\n=Kineton.= A town of England, in Warwickshire, 11 miles southeast from\r\nWarwick, in the vicinity of which the famous battle of Edgehill was\r\nfought between the royalist and Parliamentary armies in 1642.\r\n\r\n=Kinghorn.= A small burgh of Scotland, in the county of Fife, situated\r\non the Frith of Forth. In early Scottish history it was a place of\r\nimportance. Here Macbeth is said to have routed the Northmen.\r\n\r\n=King-of-Arms=, or =King-at-Arms=. The principal herald of England was\r\nat first designated king of the heralds, a title exchanged for\r\nking-of-arms about the reign of Henry IV. There are four kings-of-arms\r\nin England, named respectively Garter, Clarencieux, Norrov, and Bath;\r\nbut the first three only are members of the College of Arms. Scotland\r\nhas a heraldic officer called Lyon king-of-arms, or Lord Lyon\r\nking-at-arms. Ireland has one king-of-arms, named Ulster. See HERALD.\r\n\r\n=King’s Mountain.= A range of mountains in North and South Carolina,\r\nabout 16 miles from north to south, with several spurs spreading\r\nlaterally. About a mile and a half south of the North Carolina line, in\r\nthis range, on October 7, 1780, the British forces about 1100 strong,\r\nunder Lieut.-Col. Ferguson, were surprised and attacked by the American\r\nmilitia under Cols. Cleaveland, Shelby, and Campbell, and, after an\r\nobstinate and bloody contest, their leader being among the slain, the\r\nBritish were made prisoners.\r\n\r\n=Kingsland.= A parish of England, in Herefordshire, 4 miles west from\r\nLeominster. The battle of Mortimer’s Cross, which fixed Edward IV. on\r\nthe throne, was fought here in 1461.\r\n\r\n=Kingston.= A city in Ulster Co., N. Y., 90 miles north of New York\r\nCity. It was burnt by a British force under Sir Henry Clinton, October\r\n7, 1777; it was afterwards rebuilt and incorporated as a village in\r\n1805.\r\n\r\n=Kingston.= A village and township of Luzerne Co., Pa. In this township\r\nthe massacre of Wyoming took place, on July 3, 1778. See WYOMING VALLEY.\r\n\r\n=Kingston-upon-Thames.= A town in Surrey, England, on the Thames, 10\r\nmiles southwest of London. The first armed force of the Parliamentary\r\narmy assembled in this town, and here the last attempt in favor of\r\nCharles I. was made.\r\n\r\n=Kinsale.= A town of Ireland, in the county of Cork. This place was\r\ntaken by the Spaniards in 1601, and in 1608 King James II. landed here.\r\n\r\n=Kioge.= A seaport of Denmark, near Copenhagen, where the Danes in 1807\r\nwere signally defeated by the British.\r\n\r\n=Kiowas.= A warlike and powerful tribe of Indians, who formerly roamed\r\nover Kansas, Colorado, and Northern Texas, robbing and murdering\r\nsettlers. They are now located, to the number of about 2000, with the\r\nComanches, on a reservation in Indian Territory. In 1870, in violation\r\nof the terms of their treaty, they made a raid into Texas, where they\r\nkilled several people. For this two of their principal chiefs, Satantá\r\nand Big Tree, were sentenced to be hung; but their sentence was commuted\r\nto imprisonment for life, and they were subsequently pardoned. Of late\r\nyears they have been peaceable.\r\n\r\n=Kiptchak=, or =Kipchak=. A term which, in the Middle Ages, designated\r\nthat vast territory stretching north of the Caspian Sea, from the Don to\r\nTurkestan, and occupied by the Kumans and Polovises. This tract formed\r\none of the four empires into which the huge dominion of Genghis Khan was\r\ndivided, and was the portion of his eldest son Jûjy, under whose son and\r\nsuccessor, Batû Khan, it became the terror of Western Europe, and held\r\nRussia in iron subjection from 1236 till 1362. Batû also conquered\r\nBulgaria, and invaded Hungary, Austria, and Eastern Germany, but made no\r\npermanent conquests in this direction. This extensive empire was\r\ndismembered towards the end of the 15th century, and gave rise to the\r\nkhanates of Kazan, Astrakhan, and Crim-Tartary. The Mongols of Kiptchak\r\nwere also known as the Golden Horde.\r\n\r\n=Kirkee.= A village of Hindostan, near Poona, in the Deccan, memorable\r\nfor a battle fought there in 1817 between the Anglo-Indian forces and\r\nthe Mahrattas, who, although greatly superior in number, were compelled\r\nto retreat with severe loss.\r\n\r\n=Kisselbaches.= Soldiers are so called in India.\r\n\r\n=Kissingen.= A town of Bavaria, on the Saale, 30 miles north-northeast\r\nof Würzburg.

A town of Austria, the capital of the\r\nduchy of Carinthia, on the Glan. In 1809 the French entered this place,\r\nand destroyed the fortifications which surrounded it.\r\n\r\n=Klamaths=, or =Clamets=. A tribe of Northern California Indians, who\r\nlived in Southern Oregon and Northern California, near Klamath Lake, and\r\non Klamath and Rogue Rivers. They are generally peaceable, and number\r\nabout 700. They are now located on a reservation, and have an agency in\r\nSouthern Oregon known by their name.\r\n\r\n=Klicket.= A small gate in a palisade for the purpose of sallying forth.\r\n\r\n=Kliketats=, or =Kliktats=. A tribe of Indians who resided in Washington\r\nTerritory, in the country between the Cascade Range and the Columbia\r\nRiver, north of the Dalles. They were reduced to complete subjection in\r\n1855, and are now located with kindred tribes to the number of about\r\n4000, on the Yakima reservation, Washington Territory.\r\n\r\n=Klinket.= A term used in fortification, signifying a small postern or\r\ngate in a palisade.\r\n\r\n=Knapsack.= A bag of canvas or skin, containing a soldier’s necessaries,\r\nand worn suspended by straps between his shoulders. Those used in the\r\nBritish army are ordinarily of black painted canvas, but a new sort of\r\nknapsack, called the valise equipment, has been issued to some\r\nregiments. Some other nations, as the Swiss, make them of thick\r\ngoat-skin, dressed with the hair on.\r\n\r\n=Knight.= From the Saxon _cniht_, a servant or attendant, was originally\r\na man-at-arms bound to the performance of certain duties, among others\r\nto attend his sovereign or feudal superior on horseback in time of war.\r\nThe institution of knighthood, as conferred by investiture, and with\r\ncertain oaths and ceremonies, arose gradually throughout Europe as an\r\nadjunct of the feudal system. The character of the knight was at once\r\nmilitary and religious; the defense of the Holy Sepulchre and the\r\nprotection of pilgrims being the objects to which, in early times of the\r\ninstitution, he especially devoted himself The system of knight-service\r\nintroduced into England by William the Conqueror empowered the king, or\r\neven a superior lord who was a subject, to compel every holder of a\r\ncertain extent of land, called a knight’s fee, to become a member of the\r\nknightly order; his investiture being accounted proof that he possessed\r\nthe requisite knightly arms, and was sufficiently trained in their use.\r\nAfter the long war between France and England, it became the practice\r\nfor the sovereign to receive money compensations from subjects who were\r\nunwilling to receive knighthood, a system out of which grew a series of\r\ngrievances, leading eventually to the total abolition of knight-service\r\nin the reign of Charles II. Since the abolition of knight-service,\r\nknighthood has been conferred, without any regard to property, as a mark\r\nof the sovereign’s esteem, or a reward for services of any kind, civil\r\nor military. The ceremonies practiced in conferring knighthood have\r\nvaried at different periods. In general, some religious ceremonies were\r\nperformed, the sword and spurs were bound on the candidate; after which\r\na blow was dealt him on the cheek or shoulder, as the last affront which\r\nhe was to receive unrequited. He then took an oath to protect the\r\ndistressed, maintain right against might, and never by word or deed to\r\nstain his character as a knight and a Christian. A knight might be\r\ndegraded for the infringement of any part of his oath, in which case his\r\nspurs were chopped off with a hatchet, his sword was broken, his\r\nescutcheon reversed, and some religious observances were added, during\r\nwhich each piece of armor was taken off in succession, and cast from the\r\nrecreant knight. For the different orders of knighthood, see separate\r\narticles, under their appropriate headings, in this work.\r\n\r\n=Knight, To.= To dub or create a knight, which in modern times is done\r\nby the sovereign, who gives the person kneeling a blow with a sword, and\r\nsays, “Rise, Sir ----.”\r\n\r\n=Knight Baronet=, or =Baronet=. A dignity or degree of honor next below\r\na baron and above a knight, having precedency of all orders of knights\r\nexcept those of the garter, and being the only knighthood that is\r\nhereditary. The order was founded by James I. in 1611, and is given by\r\npatent. The word, however, in the sense of _lesser_ baron, was in use\r\nlong before the time of James I.\r\n\r\n=Knightage.= The body of knights taken collectively.\r\n\r\n=Knight-bachelor.= One of the lowest order of knights, who were expected\r\nto remain unmarried until they had gained some renown by their\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\n=Knight-banneret.= A knight who carried a banner, who possessed fiefs to\r\na greater amount than the knight-bachelor, and who was obliged to serve\r\nin war with a greater number of attendants. He was created by the\r\nsovereign in person on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n=Knight-errant.= A wandering knight; a knight who traveled in search of\r\nadventures, for the purpose of exhibiting military skill, prowess, and\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\n=Knight-errantry.= The practice of wandering in quest of adventures; the\r\nmanners of wandering knights; a quixotic or romantic adventure or\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n=Knight-erratic.= Pertaining to knight-errantry.\r\n\r\n=Knighthood.= Originally a military distinction, came, in the 16th\r\ncentury, to be occasionally conferred on civilians, as a reward for\r\nvaluable services rendered to the crown or community. The first civil\r\nknight in England was Sir William Walworth, lord mayor of London, who\r\nwon that distinction by slaying the rebel Wat Tyler in presence of the\r\nking. In recent times, it has been bestowed at least as often on\r\nscholars, lawyers, artists, or citizens, as on soldiers, and in many\r\ncases for no weightier service than carrying a congratulatory address to\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n=Knighthood.= The character, dignity, or condition of a knight.\r\n\r\n=Knightliness.= Duties of a knight.\r\n\r\n=Knightly.= Pertaining to a knight; becoming a knight; as, a knightly\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\n=Knights, Military.= An institution of military knights at Windsor,\r\nEngland, formerly called “Poor Knights,” which owes its origin to Edward\r\nIII., and is a provision for a limited number of old officers. These\r\nofficers consist of a governor and 12 knights on the upper foundation,\r\nand 5 on the lower, together 18, and are composed of officers selected\r\nfrom every grade, from a colonel to a subaltern, chiefly veterans, or on\r\nhalf-pay. They are allowed three rooms each in Windsor Palace, and 2\r\nshillings per diem for their sustenance, besides other small allowances.\r\n\r\n=Knights of St. George.= See GARTER, ORDER OF THE.\r\n\r\n=Knights Templar.= See TEMPLAR, KNIGHTS.\r\n\r\n=Knight-service.= A tenure of lands held by knights on condition of\r\nperforming military service. It was abolished in the time of Charles II.\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n=Knob of a Cascabel.= See CASCABEL.\r\n\r\n=Knot.= A twist or loop in a rope or cord, so made that the motion of\r\none piece of the line over the other shall be stopped. The knot owes its\r\npower of passive resistance to the friction of the rope. The three\r\nelementary knots, which every one should know, are the _timber-hitch_,\r\nthe _bow-line_, and the _clove-hitch_.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of the _timber-hitch_ are, that, so long as the strain upon\r\nit is kept up, it will never give; when the strain is taken off, it is\r\ncast loose immediately.\r\n\r\nThe _bow-line_ makes a knot difficult to undo; with it the ends of two\r\nstrings are tied together, or a loop made at the end of a single piece\r\nof string. For slip nooses, use the bowline to make the draw-loop.\r\n\r\nThe _clove-hitch_ binds with excessive force, and by it, and it alone,\r\ncan a weight be hung to a smooth pole, as to a tent-pole. A kind of\r\ndouble clove-hitch is generally used, but the simple one suffices, and\r\nis more easily recollected.\r\n\r\nThere are other knots very useful in the artillery service and\r\nindispensable aboard ship, viz.: _single knot_, _weaver’s knot_,\r\n_figure-eight knot_, _artificer’s knot_, _mooring knots_, _hitches_,\r\n_capstan_, or _prolonge knot_, _square knot_, _loops_, _becker knot_,\r\nand _anchor knot_.\r\n\r\n=Knot, Shoulder-=. See SHOULDER-KNOT.\r\n\r\n=Knout.= A scourge composed of many thongs of skin, plaited, and\r\ninterwoven with wire, which was till lately the favorite instrument of\r\npunishment in Russia for all classes and degrees of criminals. The\r\noffender was tied to two stakes, stripped, and received on the back the\r\nspecified number of lashes; 100 or 120 were equivalent to sentence of\r\ndeath, but in many cases the victim died under the operation long before\r\nthis number was completed. This punishment is at present only inflicted\r\nupon ordinary criminals, such as incendiaries or assassins. It is no\r\nlonger in use in the army, except when a soldier is dismissed for ill\r\nconduct, in which case 3 to 10 lashes are given, in order to disgrace\r\nthe soldier, rather than punish him.\r\n\r\n=Kolin.= A town of Bohemia, on the left bank of the Elbe. Here the\r\nAustrians under Daun defeated the Prussians under Frederick the Great,\r\nJune 18, 1757.\r\n\r\n=Koloshes.= The Russian name for the Indians of the coast of Alaska.\r\n\r\n=Komorn.= See COMORN.\r\n\r\n=Koniagas=, or =Kadiaks=. The names by which the various tribes of\r\naborigines living along the coast of Alaska for over 1500 miles, are\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n=Konieh= (anc. _Iconium_). A town of Asiatic Turkey, the capital of the\r\nprovince of Karamania, Asia Minor. Here the Turkish army was defeated by\r\nthe pasha of Egypt, after a long, sanguinary fight, December 21, 1832.\r\nSee ICONIUM.\r\n\r\n=Königgrätz.= A town and fortress of Bohemia, on the left bank of the\r\nElbe. On July 2, 1866, the Austrians under Gen. Benedek were signally\r\ndefeated with a loss of 40,000 men by the Prussians under King William,\r\nat Sadowa, near Königgrätz.\r\n\r\n=Königsberg.= A fortified city of Prussia, and former capital of the\r\nkingdom, is situated on both banks of the Pregel, and on an island in\r\nthat river, 4 miles from its entrance into the Frisch Haff. It was\r\nfounded in 1255, and in 1365 became a member of the Hanseatic League; in\r\n1626, it was surrounded with walls; and in 1657, received a strong\r\nadditional defense in the citadel of Friedrichsburg. It suffered much\r\nduring the Seven Years’ War by the occupation of the Russians from 1758\r\nto 1764; and also from the French, who entered it in 1807, after the\r\nbattle of Friedland.\r\n\r\n=Königstein.= A town of Germany, in Saxony, 17 miles southeast of\r\nDresden, on the left bank of the Elbe. It has a fortress, situated on a\r\nrock nearly 450 feet high, which is one of the few in Europe that never\r\nyet were taken. The royal treasures have usually been deposited here\r\nduring war.\r\n\r\n=Koom=, or =Kum=. A town of Persia, in the province of Irak-Ajemee. It\r\nwas destroyed by the Afghans in 1722.\r\n\r\n=Kootenais=, =Kontenays=, =Cottonois=, =Coutanies=, or =Flatbows=. A\r\ntribe of Indians who formerly resided wholly in British Columbia, but\r\nsome of them are now located in Washington, Idaho, and Montana\r\nTerritories. They are generally peaceable and self-supporting, and have\r\nmade some progress in civilization. About 400 of them reside at the\r\nFlathead Agency, Montana.\r\n\r\n=Koreish.= An Arab tribe which had the charge of the Caaba, or sacred\r\nstone of Mecca, and strenuously opposed the pretensions of Mohammed. It\r\nwas defeated by him and his adherents, 623-30.\r\n\r\n=Kossacks.= See COSSACKS.\r\n\r\n=Kossova.= A town of European Turkey, 8 miles northeast from Pristina. A\r\nbattle was fought near this place in 1389 between the Turks and Serbs.\r\nThe latter were defeated, and the king slain.\r\n\r\n=Koszegh=, or =Guns=. See GUNS.\r\n\r\n=Kotah.= The chief town of a protected state of the same name; is\r\nsituated in Rajpootana, India, on the right bank of the Chumbul. In\r\n1857, notwithstanding the fidelity of the rajah to the British\r\ngovernment, Kotah fell under the power of the mutineers, remaining in\r\ntheir possession until March 30, 1858, when it was stormed by Gen.\r\nRoberts.\r\n\r\n=Kot-duffadar.= See DUFFADAR, KOT.\r\n\r\n=Koul.= A soldier belonging to a noble corps in Persia.\r\n\r\n=Kouler-Agasi.= A distinguished military character in Persia, who has\r\nthe command of a body of men called _Kouls_. He is usually governor of a\r\nconsiderable province.\r\n\r\n=Kouls.= The third corps of the king of Persia’s household troops. The\r\nKouls are men of note and rank; no person can arrive at any considerable\r\npost or situation in Persia who has not served among the Kouls.\r\n\r\n=Kovno.= Capital of the government of the same name in European Russia,\r\nnear the confluence of the Vilia and the Niemen, was founded in the 10th\r\ncentury, and was the scene of many bloody conflicts between the Teutonic\r\nknights and Poles during the 14th and 15th centuries.\r\n\r\n=Kraal= (probably from the language of the Hottentots). In South Africa,\r\na village; a collection of huts; sometimes a single hut. This term is\r\napplied to the villages and military camps of the Zulus.\r\n\r\n=Krasnoe.= A Russian village, 30 miles southwest of Smolensk, near which\r\nthe French, in the retreat of 1812, lost, during three successive days,\r\n25,000 men, several thousand prisoners, and 25 pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\n=Kreuznach.= A town of Rhenish Prussia, on the Nahe, 40 miles\r\nsouth-southeast of Coblentz. This place was stormed by Gustavus Adolphus\r\nin 1632.\r\n\r\n=Kris=, or =Crease=. A dagger or poniard, the universal weapon of the\r\ninhabitants of the Malayan Archipelago. It is made of many different\r\nforms, short or long, straight or crooked. The hilt and scabbard are\r\noften much ornamented. Men of all ranks wear this weapon; and those of\r\nhigh rank, when in full dress, sometimes carry three or four. In Java\r\nwomen sometimes wear it.\r\n\r\n=Krupp Gun.= The metal used in these celebrated guns is cast steel, a\r\ncomposition of puddled steel and wrought iron. The wrought iron is\r\nobtained from the best hematite ores of Europe, the puddled steel from\r\nthe spathic ore of Siegen, in the immediate vicinity of the works. The\r\nproportions of each metal, the details of their preparation, as well as\r\ncertain ingredients guessed at but not known, remain a secret with the\r\nmanufacturers. Manganese in small quantity is supposed to be present and\r\nto exercise an important influence. The result is a metal equal in\r\nelasticity and tensile strength to the best English steel, the excellent\r\nquality of which is largely due to “oil tempering,” a process entirely\r\nomitted in the Krupp gun. The ingots forming the different parts of the\r\ngun are cast in cylindrical iron molds, an operation requiring the\r\ngreatest care to prevent the imprisonment of air or other gases in the\r\ncasting,--a defect which the tenacious character of the metal renders\r\nfatal. Subsequent hammering only increases the trouble by involving a\r\nlarger area. As soon as the ingot is hard enough to permit handling it\r\nis removed from the mold and cooled slowly in ashes. It is next brought\r\nto a working heat in a furnace, placed under a steam-hammer weighing\r\nfrom 1 to 50 tons, according to the size of the ingot, and drawn out to\r\nthe required length and thickness, when it is again buried in ashes and\r\ngradually annealed to remove the tensions induced by hammering. From the\r\nrough ingot thus prepared the tube forming the barrel is made directly\r\nby boring, turning, and rifling. The ingots intended for hoops, trunnion\r\nbands, etc., are cut up into short lengths, which are formed into rings\r\nwithout weld by being split through the centre within a certain distance\r\nof the ends, after which the slit is gradually widened to a circle by\r\nswaging. The parts when finished are carefully annealed.\r\n\r\nThe Krupp gun consists of a central tube or barrel, comprising the\r\ngreater mass of the gun, and a series of encircling hoops. The tube has\r\na thickness of about eight-tenths of the caliber from a point over the\r\nfront of the charge to the termination of the rings or hoops, whence it\r\nis conical, tapering to a thickness of about half the caliber at the\r\nmuzzle. From the seat of the charge breech-wards the tube thickens\r\nrapidly by a series of steps to a cylinder about 1¹⁄₅ calibers thick.\r\nThe hoops overlie the tube from the cylinder in rear to the base of the\r\ncone in front, covering about half the total length of the tube. The\r\nhoops are put on in layers, the number of layers being determined by the\r\nsize of the gun. The 6-inch gun has one, the 8- and 9-inch two, and the\r\nhigher calibers have three layers of hoops. The hoops are shrunk on at\r\nblack heat, the different layers being held in place by small key-rings.\r\n\r\nThe rifling for Krupp guns is polygrooved, the twist uniform, the\r\ngrooves being gradually narrowed towards the muzzle for the suppression\r\nof windage. The chamber in which the shot and charge rest is a little\r\nlarger than the bore, though they coincide at the bottom. This makes the\r\npassage of the projectile into the bore direct and prevents the abrasion\r\nwhich would occur if tilted upwards in leaving its seat. Moreover, the\r\nshot is “centred”--that is, has its axis in the axis of the bore--from\r\nits entry into the gun.\r\n\r\nThe breech-mechanism is essentially that of Broadwell. The breech is\r\nclosed on the “sliding block” principle. Through the cylindrical part of\r\nthe _barrel_ in rear of the rings, from one side to the other, a slot is\r\ncut in which the breech-block slides horizontally, alternately exposing\r\nand closing the rear of the chamber. The block is run in and out by an\r\nattached screw, which works partly in the upper wall of the slot. The\r\nmotion of the block is governed by guides in the upper and lower walls\r\nof the slot slightly inclined from the perpendicular to the axis of the\r\npiece. The rear of the slot is so cut that the block is wedged firmly\r\nagainst it when it is home. The block is locked in this position by a\r\nlarge screw, which catches in certain threads cut on the rear wall of\r\nthe slot. The block is furnished with an “indurator plate,” a disk of\r\nhardened steel, which is set in its face to receive the direct action of\r\nthe powder gases. The vent is in the axis of the gun through the block.\r\nThe gas-check used is the _Broadwell ring_ (which see). The powder for\r\nall the large guns is the _prismatic_. (See GUNPOWDER.) Both steel and\r\ncast-iron projectiles are used. The steel projectiles for armor piercing\r\nhave their points water-tempered. Rotation being communicated by\r\ncompression, the projectiles belong to the soft-jacketed class. The\r\nprojectile is turned smooth in a lathe, pickled in dilute acid, and then\r\nput in sal-ammoniac to remove oil. It is next galvanized by immersion in\r\nmolten zinc, then immersed in lead, and afterwards a heavy lead jacket\r\nis cast on it, which is turned down, leaving several prominent rings to\r\nfacilitate compression into the grooves. In late years Herr Krupp has\r\nadopted for his large guns the American system of projectiles, having\r\nsoft metal expanding sabots attached to the base, with a centring ring\r\nin front.\r\n\r\nKrupp guns range in size from small field-pieces to a gun weighing 72\r\ntons. The field pieces manufactured number several thousand. They form\r\nthe official equipment of the German army, and contributed much to\r\nGerman success in the Franco-Prussian war. The large guns, comprising\r\n6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, and 12-inch guns, have been made in large\r\nnumbers, and have found a ready sale in Germany, Russia, and Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe largest guns are a 14-inch gun weighing 56 tons, and a 15³⁄₄-inch\r\nweighing 72 tons. (See CANNON.) Herr Krupp is also a large manufacturer\r\nof gun-carriages of all kinds. His partiality for steel has led him to\r\nuse it almost exclusively in his constructions. He has inherited\r\nlikewise the aversion of the great Borsig for _welding_; and a\r\nnoticeable feature of his guns is an absence of any _weld_. The “coil”\r\nprinciple, so well adapted to develop tangential strength, is also\r\nomitted, the character of the metal being relied upon to resist strains\r\n“across the grain.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most novel piece of ordnance of modern times is Krupp’s\r\n_non-recoiling shield gun_. This gun is made with an enlargement around\r\nthe muzzle in the shape of a large ball, which is held in a socket\r\nformed in a heavy armored shield protecting the gun in front, the\r\narrangement giving a veritable ball-and-socket joint, about which the\r\ngun is elevated and traversed. On shipboard or in a fortification the\r\nshield would form a part of the armor or scarp wall. A narrow slit above\r\nthe ball is used in pointing by the gunner, who for this purpose sits\r\nastride of the gun. The problem solved by this unique arrangement is the\r\nentire suppression of recoil, the strain being absorbed by the massive\r\nshield. In the late experiments at Mappen, 1879, the triumphs of Krupp\r\nguns culminated in the performances of this novel piece of ordnance. Its\r\naction was satisfactory in every respect, and so slight was the shock\r\ncommunicated to the gun that the gunner did not deem it necessary to\r\ndismount, but kept his seat astride of it during the firing.\r\n\r\n=Krupp’s Steel Works.= On account of the wide-spread reputation which\r\nthe steel produced in the great works of Krupp at Essen, in Rhenish\r\nPrussia, has obtained, it is necessary that these works should receive a\r\nbrief notice. They were founded by Friedrich Krupp in 1810, and were\r\ncontinued by his sons after his death in 1826. For the last fifty years\r\nthey have been increasing annually from one-sixth to one-third in size,\r\nuntil now they cover about 500 acres, and give employment to about\r\n20,000 persons, including those engaged in building, and in the mines\r\nand smelting-houses. For large metallurgical works Essen is favorably\r\nsituated, being in the centre of a coal-bearing area, where coal of the\r\nbest quality can be procured cheaply, and near mines of manganiferous\r\niron ore, which has been found excellently adapted for the manufacture\r\nof steel; but it is believed that the admirable organization of every\r\npart of his manufactory has conduced as much as anything to the great\r\nsuccess of Krupp. The articles manufactured consist principally of\r\nrails, tires, crank-axles, shafts, mining pump-rods, gun-carriages and\r\nguns, the proportion of ordnance being about two-fifths of the whole.\r\nGuns have been made at Essen for the Prussians, Austrians, Belgians,\r\nDutch, Italians, Turks, Japanese, and also for the English, although not\r\ndirectly ordered by the government. Since 1872 a field-gun invented by\r\nKrupp has been adopted by the Prussian government, and supplied to the\r\nwhole army. The establishment possesses 286 steam-engines from 2 to 1000\r\nhorse-power, 1100 furnaces of various kinds, 71 steam-hammers, 264\r\nsmith’s forges, 275 coke-ovens, and 1056 planing, cutting, and boring\r\nmachines. It burns over 1000 tons of coal daily, and has over 11,000\r\ngas-burners, consuming in twenty-four hours 400,000 cubic feet of gas.\r\nIt has, besides, a complete telegraph system, 800 cars, 15 locomotives,\r\n33 miles of railway, over 3000 dwelling-houses, hospitals, chemical\r\nlaboratory, a photographic and lithographic establishment, over 400\r\nmines, 11 blast-furnaces and several smelting-houses which produce\r\nannually about 20,000 tons of pig-iron. These works have already\r\nproduced over 18,000 heavy guns.\r\n\r\n=Kshatriya.= The second or military caste in the social system of the\r\nBrahmanical Hindus.\r\n\r\n=Ku-Klux-Klan.= A secret organization of ex-Confederate soldiers, who,\r\nfor several years after the close of the civil war, by their murders and\r\nother crimes disturbed the tranquillity of the Southern States. Their\r\nvictims were chiefly freedmen, and persons suspected of favoring the\r\npolicy of the government. Stringent measures were taken against them by\r\nCongress in 1871, and they soon after ceased their disturbances.\r\n\r\n=Kul.= The Turkish word for slave to the Prince. The grand vizier, the\r\nbachas, the beiglerbeys, and all persons who receive pay or subsistence\r\nfrom situations dependent upon the crown, are so called. This title is\r\nin high estimation among the Turkish military, as it authorizes all who\r\nare invested with it to insult, strike, and otherwise ill use the common\r\npeople, without being responsible for the most flagrant breach of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n=Kulm.= A small village of Bohemia, 16 miles north-northwest of\r\nLeitmeritz, was the scene of two bloody conflicts between the French and\r\nallied Russian-Austrian armies on August 29-30, 1813. The French,\r\nnumbering 30,000 men, were commanded by Gen. Vandamme; the Russians,\r\nduring the first day’s conflict, were 17,000, and were commanded by Gen.\r\nOstermann-Tolstoi. During the night, the latter were heavily reinforced,\r\nand on the second day Barclay de Tolly assumed the command with 60,000\r\ntroops. The result was the complete wreck of the French army, which lost\r\nin these two days little short of 20,000 men, while the allies did not\r\nlose half of that number.\r\n\r\n=Kunnersdorf.= See CUNNERSDORF.\r\n\r\n=Kunobitza.= In the Balkan, where John Hunniades, the Hungarian,\r\ndefeated the Turks, December 24, 1443.\r\n\r\n=Kupele.= Straits so called in India, through which the Ganges\r\ndisembogues itself into Hindustan. They are distant from Delhi about 30\r\nleagues. It was at these straits that the East Indians made some show of\r\nresistance when the famous Tamerlane (Timur) invaded India. The field of\r\nthis victory is the most distant point of that emperor’s conquest in\r\nIndia, and on the globe.\r\n\r\n=Kurrol= (_Ind._). The advanced-guard of a main army.\r\n\r\n=Kurtchi.= A militia is so called in Persia. It consists of one body of\r\ncavalry, which is composed of the first nobility of the kingdom, and of\r\nthe lineal descendants of the Turkish conquerors, who placed Ismael\r\nSophi on the throne. They wear a red turban of twelve folds, which is\r\nmade of particular stuff. This turban was originally given them by\r\nIsmael, in consideration of their attachment to the religion and family\r\nof Ali. In consequence of their wearing this turban, the Persians are\r\nalways called by the Turks _kitilbaschi_, or red-heads. The Kurtchi form\r\na body of nearly 18,000 men.\r\n\r\n=Kurtchi-baschi.= The chief or commanding officer of the Kurtchi. This\r\nwas formerly the most distinguished situation in the kingdom, and the\r\nauthority annexed to it was equal to what the constable of France\r\noriginally possessed. At present his power does not extend beyond the\r\nKurtchis.\r\n\r\n=Kush-bash= (_Ind._). Persons who enjoy lands rent free, upon condition\r\nof serving the government in a military capacity when called upon.\r\n\r\n=Kustrin=, or =Custrin=. A fortified town of Prussia, in the province of\r\nBrandenburg, at the union of the Wartha with the Oder, 48 miles east\r\nfrom Berlin. In 1758 it was bombarded by the Russians, and in 1806 taken\r\nby the French. It has a large powder-magazine.\r\n\r\n=Kutchin.= A family of Alaska Indians, which is divided into a number of\r\npetty tribes, who occupy the valley of the Yukon River.\r\n\r\n=Kyanizing.= A process for preserving timber from decay,--so named from\r\nthe inventor Kyan. The process consists in saturating the wood with a\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\n=Kythul.= A town of India, and the capital of a district of the same\r\nname. The district fell into the possession of the British in 1843, from\r\nthe failure of heirs to the last rajah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Labarum.= A military standard of the Roman empire. It consisted of a\r\nlong lance crossed at right angles near the top by a staff, from which\r\nhung a small flag or streamer of purple cloth inwrought with gold and\r\nprecious stones, and bearing the effigy of the emperor. Constantine the\r\nGreat, when he embraced Christianity, substituted for that device a\r\ncrown, a cross, and the initial letters of the name of Christ, and made\r\nit the imperial standard.\r\n\r\n=Labeates.= A warlike people in Dalmatia, whose chief town was Scodra,\r\nand in whose territory was the Labeatis Palus (now Lake of Scutari),\r\nthrough which the river Barbana (now Bogana) runs.\r\n\r\n=Label=, =Lambel=, or =File=. In heraldry, is the mark of cadency which\r\ndistinguishes the eldest son in his father’s lifetime. It consists of a\r\nhorizontal stripe or fillet, with three points depending from it. When\r\nthe mark of cadency itself is designated a _file_, its points are called\r\n_labels_.\r\n\r\n=Labicum=, =Labici=, =Lavicum=, =Lavici= (now _Colonna_). An ancient\r\ntown in Latium, on one of the hills of the Alban Mountain, 15 miles\r\nsoutheast from Rome. It was an ally of the Æqui; taken and colonized by\r\nthe Romans, 418 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory.= A department which is intrusted with the manufacture of\r\ncombustible and other substances for military purposes, such as blank\r\nand ball cartridges for small-arms, cartridges for every description of\r\nordnance, rockets, and all stores of similar character. This department\r\nis likewise intrusted with the conservation, packing, restoring, and\r\nsupply of all gunpowder to the several military and naval departments,\r\nand in the British service is under the management of officers of the\r\nroyal artillery especially appointed to that duty; in the U. S. service\r\nit is under the officers of the ordnance department. In the latter\r\nservice officers of artillery, as well as non-commissioned officers and\r\nprivates, are instructed at the artillery school, Fort Monroe, Va., in\r\nlaboratory duties, and carefully taught the manipulation and manufacture\r\nof laboratory stores. At the West Point Military Academy, the cadets are\r\nthoroughly instructed in the above duties, as are also the naval cadets\r\nat the Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md. In the British service officers of\r\nartillery, as well as non-commissioned officers and gunners, are\r\ninstructed in laboratory duties. Officers and non-commissioned officers\r\nof artillery in Germany, France, and Austria are required to possess a\r\nknowledge of the manufacture and care of laboratory stores.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory, Royal.= An extensive military manufacturing department in\r\nWoolwich Arsenal, England. Although it has existed for many years, it\r\nwas only in 1855 that the present very large establishment was\r\norganized. Here are foundries for the casting of shot, shell, grape,\r\netc.; apparatus for the manufacture of percussion-caps, which are\r\nformed--hundreds at a time--out of the copper sheet; presses where\r\nrifle-bullets are squeezed into shape; fuzes in all stages of\r\nmanufacture; and a thousand other instances of combined ingenuity and\r\npower. The British government grants permission to inspect the factory.\r\nThere are also laboratories--though on a comparatively small scale--at\r\nPortsmouth and Davenport, England.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Stores.= The following are among the laboratory stores used\r\nin service:\r\n\r\nThe _time-fuze_, the _percussion-fuze_, and the _concussion-fuze_ (which\r\nsee).\r\n\r\nThe _wooden fuze_ consists of a conical plug of wood of the proper size\r\nfor the fuze-hole of the shell with which it is to be fired. The axis of\r\nthis plug is bored out cylindrically from the large, down to within a\r\nshort distance of the small end, which is left solid. At the large end a\r\ncup is hollowed out, and the outside of the plug is divided into inches\r\nand parts, generally tenths, commencing at the bottom of the cup. The\r\ncylindrical space is filled with composition, pounded hard, and as\r\nregularly as possible, and the cup filled with meal powder moistened\r\nwith whisky or alcohol. The rate of burning is determined by experiment,\r\nand marked on a waterproof cap, which is tied over the cup. Knowing the\r\ntime any shell is to occupy in its flight, the fuze is cut off with a\r\nsaw at the proper division, and firmly set in the fuze-hole with a\r\nfuze-set and mallet. The disadvantage of this fuze is its irregularity,\r\nit being very difficult to pound the composition so that equal lengths\r\nwill burn equal times. The shell may either burst too soon, and a great\r\npart of its effect lost, or it may burst after burying itself in the\r\nground, or it may burst after passing the proper point. This\r\nirregularity of burning is common to all fuzes where the composition is\r\ndriven in successive layers in a column which burns in the same\r\ndirection. This fuze is used with mortar shells. The composition of\r\nmortar-fuzes is, nitre 2 parts, sulphur 1 part, and meal powder 3 parts;\r\nthe quantities of meal powder vary in fuzes for mortars of different\r\ncalibers. Generally these fuzes are cut before being inserted in the\r\nshell; but they are sometimes bored through at the proper positions\r\ninstead of being sawed. They are also cut obliquely, when the fuze is so\r\nlong as to render it likely that it will reach the bottom of the shell;\r\nfor by cutting it perpendicular to the axis, the whole base of the wood\r\nmight be driven in contact with the bottom of the shell, and prevent the\r\nlighted composition from setting fire to the bursting charge.\r\n\r\nThe _paper time-fuze_ consists of a cylindrical column of burning\r\ncomposition packed in a paper case, gradually increasing in thickness\r\nfrom its lower to its upper or outer extremity; to insure ignition, it\r\nis primed with rifle-powder at the larger end. It is inserted at the\r\ntime of loading the piece into a brass or wooden plug previously driven\r\ninto the fuze-hole of the shell. The composition has the same\r\ningredients as gunpowder, the proportions being varied to suit the\r\nrequired rate of combustion; pure _meal_ powder gives the quickest\r\ncomposition; by adding certain proportions of sulphur and nitre, the\r\ncomposition burns more slowly. The rate of burning also depends upon the\r\ndensity of the composition and the purity and thorough mixture of the\r\ningredients. These fuzes vary in length, burning from 4 to 40 seconds;\r\nthey are graduated in seconds on the outside of the case, and can be cut\r\nto a length corresponding to any intermediate time of flight.\r\n\r\n_Belgian_, or _Bormann-fuze_. See BORMANN-FUZE.\r\n\r\nThe _Wright-fuze_, a modification of the Bormann-fuze, extends the time\r\nof burning to 12 or 14 seconds.\r\n\r\n_United States sea-coast fuze._ The paper case fits in a fuze-plug of\r\nbronze instead of wood. It fits the fuze-hole of the shell in the same\r\nway as the wooden plug, and is retained by the force of friction. A\r\nsafety-cap and primer combined have been adopted to prevent ricochets,\r\nespecially over water, from extinguishing the fuze. A recess in the top,\r\nfilled with priming composition, is covered until the fuze is required\r\nfor use, with a disk of lead or paper fitting accurately the opening.\r\nThe fire is conveyed to the fuze composition through a crooked passage\r\nwhich is filled with priming, and prevents water from entering in\r\nsufficient quantity to extinguish the fuze. For security a small leaden\r\nplug is placed in the inner end of the fuze-plug, where it remains until\r\nit is driven out by the shock of the explosion. When the shell is placed\r\nin the piece, nothing more is necessary than to remove the disk which\r\ncovers the recess in the top. _Paper-fuzes_ are inserted at the moment\r\nof loading the gun, and into wooden or brass _fuze-plugs_ previously\r\ndriven into the shell.\r\n\r\n_Port-fire_ consists of a small paper case, filled with a highly\r\ninflammable but slow-burning composition, the flame of which is very\r\nintense and penetrating, and cannot be extinguished by water, it is\r\nprincipally used as an incendiary material in loading shells, and for\r\ncommunicating fire to the priming of guns when proving them.\r\n\r\n_Port-fire composition_ consists of nitre, sulphur, and meal powder, in\r\ndifferent proportions. One kind is composed of nitre, 65 parts; sulphur,\r\n22.5 parts; and meal-powder, 12.5 parts. A port-fire case, 18 inches in\r\nlength, filled with this composition, burns 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Priming-tubes_ are small pipes having a cup on one end, and filled with\r\na composition for firing cannon. The tube in general use in the U. S.\r\nservice is the _friction-primer_ (which see).\r\n\r\n_Slow-match_ is a slow-burning match prepared from hemp or flax slightly\r\ntwisted, soaked in strong lye, or in water holding in solution sugar of\r\nlead. Cotton rope well twisted forms a good match without any\r\npreparation. Slow-match prepared from hemp or flax burns 4 to 5 inches\r\nto the hour; it is used principally for the purpose of retaining fire in\r\nthe shape of a hard-pointed coal, to be used in firing cannon,\r\nfireworks, etc. It was formerly used in field-batteries for lighting the\r\nport-fires with which the pieces were discharged; but both are now\r\nentirely superseded by the friction-primer.\r\n\r\n_Quick-match_ is a match made of threads of cotton, or cotton-wick,\r\nsteeped in gummed brandy or whisky, then soaked in a paste of meal\r\npowder and gummed spirits, and afterwards strewed over with meal powder;\r\none yard of it burns in the open air 13 seconds. The quick-match is used\r\nto fire mortars, and sometimes in proving pieces. It is extensively used\r\nin priming all kinds of fireworks, such as fire and light balls,\r\ncarcasses, rockets, priming-tubes, etc., and in conveying fire very\r\nrapidly from one portion of a piece of firework to another. When used\r\nfor discharging cannon, the quick-match is set fire to by a slow-match,\r\nport-fire, or any other convenient material. When used to prime\r\ncarcasses, etc., it is set on fire by the flame from the piece.\r\n\r\nThe _Valenciennes_ composition is a compound of 50 parts of nitre, 28 of\r\nsulphur, 18 of antimony, and 6 of rosin; it is used as an incendiary\r\ncomposition, in charging shells for the purpose of increasing their\r\ndestructive property, by setting fire to buildings, shipping, etc. For\r\nmanufacture of ammunition for small-arms, see “U. S. Ordnance\r\nMemorandum,” No. 21, 1878.\r\n\r\n=Laborer= (_Fr._). In a military sense, expresses any direct and\r\nconcentrated effort which is made to destroy a fortification. It\r\nlikewise applies to the working of a bomb or shell, which excavates,\r\nplows up, and scatters the earth about wherever it bursts. _Laborer un\r\nrampart_, signifies to bring several pieces of ordnance discharged from\r\ntwo oblique directions to bear upon one centre. Shells are generally\r\nused on these occasions, and the chief design is to second the\r\noperations of the miner in some particular part from which the explosion\r\nis to take place.\r\n\r\n=Labuan Pulo.= An island of the Malay Archipelago, lying off the\r\nnorthwest coast of Borneo. The British took possession of this island in\r\n1846, and it was formally ceded to the British crown by the sultan of\r\nBorneo in 1848.\r\n\r\n=Lacandones.= A tribe of Indians in Central America, who for more than\r\nthree centuries maintained a hostile attitude to the Spaniards. They are\r\nnominally subject to Guatemala, but are in reality quite independent.\r\n\r\n=Lacay=, or =Laquet= (_Fr._). An old French militia was formerly so\r\ncalled. The name is found among the public documents which were kept by\r\nthe treasurers belonging to the dukes of Brittany in the 15th century.\r\n\r\n=Lacerne= (_Fr._). The short woolen military cloak of the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Lacheté= (_Fr._). An opprobrious term which is frequently used among\r\nthe French, and is applied in all instances of cowardice, want of\r\nspirit, or dishonorable conduct. _La trahison est une lacheté_; treason\r\nis infamous in its nature.\r\n\r\n=Lachish.= A city of Southern Palestine. It was taken after a two days’\r\nsiege by Joshua, and, in later times, is repeatedly mentioned as a place\r\nstrongly fortified. After a siege, conducted by Sennacherib in person,\r\nit was taken and plundered, with the customary massacre of its\r\ninhabitants. It was taken by Nebuchadnezzar at the downfall of the\r\nkingdom of Judæa, and was reoccupied by the Jews after the Return.\r\n\r\n=Lacker.= A composition made use of for preserving iron cannon,\r\ncarriages, shot, etc. The following are the proportional parts of\r\ncompositions made use of for preserving iron cannon: (1) Pulverized\r\nblack lead, 12; red lead, 12; litharge, 5; lampblack, 5; linseed oil,\r\n66. This composition is to be boiled gently about twenty minutes, during\r\nwhich time it must be constantly stirred. (2) Ground umber, 3.75;\r\npulverized gum shellac, 3.75; ivory-black, 3.75; litharge, 3.75; linseed\r\noil, 78; spirits of turpentine, 7.25. The oil must be first boiled half\r\nan hour; the mixture is then boiled twenty-four hours, poured off from\r\nthe sediment, and put in jugs, corked. (3) Coal-tar (of good quality), 2\r\ngallons, and spirits of turpentine, 1 pint. In applying lacker, the\r\nsurface of the iron must be first cleaned with a scraper and a wire\r\nbrush, if necessary, and the lacker applied hot, in two thin coats, with\r\na paint-brush. It is better to do it in summer. Old lacker should be\r\nremoved with a scraper, or by scouring, and not by heating the guns or\r\nballs, by which the metal is injured. About 5 gallons of lacker are\r\nrequired for 100 field-guns and 1000 shot; about one quart for a\r\nsea-coast gun. Before the lacker is applied every particle of rust is\r\nremoved from the gun, and the vent cleaned out.\r\n\r\n=Lacs d’Amour.= In heraldry, a cord of running knots used as an external\r\ndecoration to surround the arms of widows and unmarried women; the\r\n_cordélier_, which differs but slightly from it, being used similarly\r\nwith the shields of married women.\r\n\r\n=Lacunette= (_Fr._). A term in fortification. A small fosse or ditch was\r\nformerly so called. The word _cunette_ (which see) has since been\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n=Ladder Bridge.= Used for crossing streams, etc. It is formed by running\r\na cart or gun-limber into the stream and securing it there, with the\r\nshafts in a vertical position, by ropes from both sides of the river;\r\none end of a ladder from each bank resting upon it, and covering the\r\nsteps or rungs with planks.\r\n\r\n=Ladders, Scaling= (Fr. _eschelles de siege_). Are used in scaling when\r\na place is to be taken by surprise. They are made several ways;\r\nsometimes of flat staves, so as to move about their pins and shut like a\r\nparallel ruler, for conveniently carrying them. The French make them of\r\nseveral pieces, so as to be joined together, and to be capable of any\r\nnecessary length. Sometimes they are made of single ropes, knotted at\r\nproper distances, with iron hooks at each end, one to fasten them upon\r\nthe wall above, and the other in the ground; and sometimes they are made\r\nof two ropes, with staves between them to keep the ropes at a proper\r\ndistance, and to tread upon. When they are used in the action of scaling\r\nwalls, they ought to be rather too long than too short, and to be given\r\nin charge only to the stoutest of the detachment. The soldiers should\r\ncarry these ladders with the left arm passed through the second step,\r\ntaking care to hold them upright close to their sides, and very short\r\nbelow, to prevent any accident in leaping into the ditch.\r\n\r\n=Ladle.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Lady of Mercy, Our.= A Spanish order of knighthood, founded in 1218 by\r\nJames I. of Aragon, in fulfillment of a vow made to the Virgin during\r\nhis captivity in France. The object for which the order was instituted\r\nwas the redemption of Christian captives from among the Moors, each\r\nknight at his inauguration vowing that if necessary for their ransom he\r\nwould remain himself a captive in their stead. Within the first six\r\nyears of the existence of the order no fewer than 400 captives are said\r\nto have been ransomed by its means. On the expulsion of the Moors from\r\nSpain, the labors of the knights were transferred to Africa. The order\r\nwas extended to ladies in 1261. Their badge is a shield party per fess\r\ngules and or, in chief a cross pattée argent, in base four pellets gules\r\nfor Aragon, the shield crowned with a ducal coronet.\r\n\r\n=Lady of Montesa, Our.= An order of knighthood, founded in 1317 by King\r\nJames II. of Aragon, who, on the abrogation of the order of Templars,\r\nurged Pope Clement V. to allow him to employ all their estates within\r\nhis territory in founding a new knightly order for the protection of the\r\nChristians against the Moors. His request was acceded to by the\r\nfollowing pope, John XXII., who granted him for this purpose all the\r\nestates of the Templars and of the knights of St. John situated in\r\nValencia. The order is now conferred merely as a mark of royal favor.\r\nThe badge is a red cross edged with gold, the costume a long white\r\nwoolen mantle, decorated with a cross on the left breast, and tied with\r\nvery long white cords.\r\n\r\n=Lagos.= A city and seaport of Portugal, in the province of Algarve,\r\nabout 23 miles east-northeast from the extremity of Cape St. Vincent. In\r\nthe Bay of Lagos, Admiral Boscawen obtained a signal victory over the\r\nFrench Toulon fleet, August 18, 1759.\r\n\r\n=Lagos.= In the Bight of Benin, Africa; this place was assaulted and\r\ntaken by the boats of a British squadron, under Commodore Bruce,\r\nDecember 26-27, 1851. In 1862 the place was ceded to the British\r\ngovernment, and created a settlement.\r\n\r\n=Lahore.= The capital of the Punjab, in British India, standing on the\r\nRavee, 270 miles northwest from Delhi. It was taken by Baber about 1520,\r\nand was long the capital of the Mongol empire. It fell into the power of\r\nthe Sikhs in 1798; was occupied by Sir Hugh Gough, February 22, 1846,\r\nwho in March concluded a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n=Laibach=, or =Laybach=. A town of Austria, capital of the duchy of\r\nCarniola, 44 miles northeast from Trieste. This place was taken in 1799\r\nby Bernadotte, and in 1809 by Macdonald. It is well known from the\r\ncongress which was held in it in 1821, the object of which was the\r\nextinction of constitutional government, as established in Naples after\r\nthe insurrection in 1820.\r\n\r\n=Laidley’s Practice Musket.= This gun is made out of an old smooth-bore\r\nmusket, reamed out for a length of 11 inches, for the reception of a\r\ncoil ribbon spring, on one end of which a closely-fitting piston is\r\nplaced, having a stem of about 5 inches attached to its centre; a hole\r\nis bored through the breech-screw and a cut made on its under side to\r\nreceive a spring; a circular disk with a flaring hole through its centre\r\nis secured in the barrel just in front of the end of the breech-screw; a\r\nshort lever crosses the end of the barrel just in front of this disk,\r\nand is held in position by the spring already referred to; the hole in\r\nthe cone is enlarged and receives a small spindle with a collar at its\r\nmiddle, which prevents it from coming out. About 12 inches from the\r\nbreech a horizontal cut is made through the top of the barrel, leaving\r\nan opening of 2 inches in length; a cylindrical plug having a hole\r\nthrough its axis is inserted in the barrel at this place, and a handle\r\nscrewed in. An inner barrel, having a bore of .22 inch and a length of\r\n17 inches, its upper end counter-bored, is inserted in the barrel and\r\nsecured by a screw; the length of the block is such as to close the\r\nspace between the chambered recess and the end of the inner barrel. A\r\nhole is bored through the side of the stock to communicate with the hole\r\nthrough the breech-screw. A dart is fired from this musket, which when\r\nfired into the target is extracted with a claw-tool. The men in firing\r\nstand at a distance of 15 paces from the target; and two men use the\r\ngun, firing alternately. This is a very useful musket to practice the\r\nsoldier in rifle-firing. The soldier can also be practiced at long\r\nranges with this gun in the following manner: Place a target at 500 or\r\n600 yards distant, or as far off as convenient, so that it can be seen\r\nthrough the open window; place a target (16 inches square, with a\r\nbull’s-eye of .75 inch) 15 paces from the firing-stand, at such a height\r\nthat the distant target may be seen 4 or 5 inches below the middle of\r\nits lower edge; mark on the floor the position for the feet of the man\r\nwhen firing, raise the longer leaf of the sight, aim at the distant\r\nbull’s-eye, and fire; the shots will strike the near target if correctly\r\nplaced, and the accuracy of aim will be shown by the score thus made.\r\nThe height of the target may have to be adjusted after the first few\r\nshots.\r\n\r\n=Laird.= A leader or captain.\r\n\r\n=Laisches= (_Fr._). Were thin metal plates which the ancient Gauls\r\nplaced upon the buff-coats of infantry, between the buff and the lining.\r\n\r\n=Lake Champlain.= See CHAMPLAIN, LAKE.\r\n\r\n=Lake Ontario.= See ONTARIO, LAKE.\r\n\r\n=Lake Regillus.= In Italy, where tradition states the Romans defeated\r\nthe Latin auxiliaries of the expelled Tarquins about 499 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Lama.= See PACK AND DRAUGHT ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n=Lambrequin.= Leathern strap or flap hanging from a cuirass, often\r\nhighly ornamented. Also ribbon of different colors for fastening a\r\nhelmet, twisted round its crest, the knot forming an ornament.\r\n\r\n=Lamia= (now _Zeitun_, or _Zetuni_). A town in Phthiotis, in Thessaly,\r\nsituated on the small river Achelous. It has given its name to the war\r\nwhich was carried on by the confederate Greeks against Antipater, after\r\nthe death of Alexander, 323 B.C. The confederates under the command of\r\nLeosthenes, the Athenian, defeated Antipater, who took refuge in Lamia,\r\nwhere he was besieged for some months. Leosthenes was killed during the\r\nsiege; and the confederates were obliged to raise it in the following\r\nyear (322), in consequence of the approach of Leomatus. The confederates\r\nunder the command of Antiphilus defeated Leomatus, who was slain in the\r\naction. Soon afterwards Antipater was joined by Craterus; and thus\r\nstrengthened, he gained a decisive victory over the confederates at the\r\nbattle of Cranon (322), which put an end to the Lamian war.\r\n\r\n=Lamian War.= See LAMIA.\r\n\r\n=Lampion de Parapet= (_Fr._). A lamp generally used on a parapet or\r\nelsewhere in a besieged place. It was a small iron vessel filled with\r\npitch and tar, which was lighted by the troops as occasion required.\r\n\r\n=Lancaster.= The chief town of Lancashire, England, situated on the\r\nriver Lune. It is supposed to have been the _Ad Alaunam_ of the Romans.\r\nIt was granted by William I. or II. to Roger de Poitou, who erected a\r\ncastle upon its hill. It was taken by the Jacobites, November, 1715, and\r\nNovember, 1745.\r\n\r\n=Lancaster Gun.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Lancaster Herald.= One of the six heralds of England, ranking second in\r\nseniority. His office is said to have been instituted by Edward III.,\r\nwhen he created his son, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. Henry IV.\r\nraised Lancaster to the dignity of king-at-arms. Edward IV., after\r\nreducing him back to the status of a herald, abolished his office, which\r\nwas revived by Henry VII.\r\n\r\n=Lancaster Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Lancastrians.= See ROSES, WARS OF THE.\r\n\r\n=Lance.= A weapon of war, consisting of a long shaft or handle, and\r\nmetal point, now usually adorned with a small flag, and generally used\r\nby horsemen to transfix an enemy, but formerly used sometimes as a\r\njavelin. This offensive weapon was much used by the French in former\r\ntimes, particularly by that class of military gentlemen called\r\nchevaliers, and by the gendarmes. Before the reign of Philip de Valois,\r\nthe chevaliers and gendarmes fought on foot, armed with lances only,\r\nboth in battles and at sieges. On these occasions they shortened their\r\nlances, which were then said to be _retaillees_, or cut again.\r\n\r\n=Lance= (_Fr._). Means likewise an iron rod which is fixed across the\r\nearthen mold of a shell, and which keeps it suspended in the air when it\r\nis cast. As soon as the shell is formed, this rod must be broken, and\r\ncarefully taken out with instruments made for that purpose. Shells ought\r\nto be scrupulously examined with respect to this article, as they could\r\nnot be charged were the lance or any part of it to remain within. This\r\nis also the name of an instrument which conveys the charge of a piece of\r\nordnance and forces it home to the bore.\r\n\r\n=Lance.= A soldier armed with a spear; a lancer.\r\n\r\n=Lance.= To pierce with a lance, or any similar weapon; to throw in the\r\nmanner of a lance. See LANCH.\r\n\r\n=Lance a Feu= (_Fr._). A squib. A species of artificial firework which\r\nis made in the shape of a fuze, and is used for various purposes. The\r\ncomposition of the _lance a feu_ consists of 3 parts of the best refined\r\nsaltpetre, 2 parts of flour of sulphur, and 2 of antimony; the whole\r\nbeing pounded and mixed together. The chief use of the _lance a feu_ is\r\nto throw occasional light across the platform, whilst artificial\r\nfireworks are preparing. They likewise serve to set fire to fuzes, as\r\nthey can be taken hold of without danger.\r\n\r\n=Lance a Feu Puant= (_Fr._). Stink-fire lances prepared in the same\r\nmanner that stink-pots are, and particularly useful to miners. When a\r\nsapper or miner has so far penetrated towards the enemy as to hear the\r\nvoices of persons in any places contiguous to his own excavation, he\r\nfirst of all bores a hole with his probe, then fires off several pistols\r\nthrough the aperture, and lastly forces in a _lance a feu puant_, taking\r\ncare to close up the hole on his side to prevent the smoke from\r\nreturning towards himself. The exhalation and stinking hot vapor which\r\nissue from the lance, and remain confined on the side of the enemy,\r\ninfest the air so much, that it is impossible to approach the quarter\r\nfor three or four days. Sometimes, indeed, they have had so\r\ninstantaneous an effect, that in order to save their lives, miners, who\r\nwould persevere, have been dragged out by the legs in an apparent state\r\nof suffocation.\r\n\r\n=Lance de Feu= (_Fr._). A species of squib, which is used by the\r\ngarrison of a besieged town against a scaling party.\r\n\r\n=Lance, Free.= See FREE LANCE.\r\n\r\n=Lance Socket.= A leather socket which supports the butt of the lance\r\nwhen carried on horseback; called also lance bucket.\r\n\r\n=Lance-Corporal.= An assistant to a corporal; a private performing the\r\nduties of a corporal; a lance-pesade.

See LANSQUENET.\r\n\r\n=Lance-pesade.= See ANSPESSADE.\r\n\r\n=Lance-rest.= A projection like a bracket, on the right side of a\r\nbreastplate in armor, to aid in bearing a lance.\r\n\r\n=Lancers.= A description of cavalry soldiers in different armies of\r\nEurope, who are armed with lances. The type and perfection of lancers\r\nare the Russian Cossacks, whose long lances enable them to combat with\r\nenemies at a distance from which they themselves take little harm. The\r\nlancers were brought into European notice by Napoleon, who greatly\r\nrelied upon some Polish regiments. After the peace of 1815, the arm was\r\nadopted in the English service, but it is thought by many that the\r\nBritish lancer has a weapon too short to enable him to charge an\r\ninfantry square with any chance of success.\r\n\r\n=Lances Levées= (_Fr._). Uplifted lances, indicating that the enemy was\r\nbeaten, and that the chevaliers or gendarmes should close the day by\r\ngiving a final blow to the disordered ranks.\r\n\r\n=Lanch.= To throw, as a lance; to dart; to let fly. To pierce with a\r\nlance, or as with a lance; to wound.

This place was held\r\nalternately by the French and Austrians from 1680 to 1815, when it was\r\nassigned to the Germanic Confederation, under the protection of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n=Landen.= See NEERWINDEN.\r\n\r\n=Land-force.= A military force, army, or body of troops serving on land,\r\nas distinguished from a naval force.\r\n\r\n=Landgrave.= A German nobleman of a rank corresponding to an English\r\nearl.\r\n\r\n=Landgravine.= The wife of a landgrave.\r\n\r\n=Landing.= In fortification, is the portion of the floor of the gallery\r\nbetween the frames that bound the entrance to a return. The landing is\r\nin all cases horizontal.\r\n\r\n=Landing of Troops.= See DISEMBARKATION.\r\n\r\n=Landshut.= A town of Prussian Silesia. In June, 1760, the Austrians\r\ngained a decisive victory over the Prussians in this place.\r\n\r\n=Landsturm.= A local militia of Prussia, formed of men above forty\r\nyears of age, which never leaves its own district, and is only called\r\nout in case of actual invasion.\r\n\r\n=Landwehr.= The militia of a country. Austria has a landwehr--_bei den\r\nOestreichern_; and Prussia--_bei den Preussen_. The former are a sort of\r\na reserve to each regiment of the line; they are under the same colonel,\r\nand are drilled once a year with the line regiment. The Prussian\r\nlandwehr is more completely national. Every Prussian subject commences\r\nmilitary service in the standing army, a force composed of the youth of\r\nthe nation from twenty to twenty-five years old. After two or three\r\nyears of service, the soldier proceeds to his home, but is liable to be\r\ncalled upon to join his regiment. During this period he is called a\r\n_reservist_. At the expiration of five years from the date of\r\nenlistment, the men are transferred into the first class or levy of the\r\nlandwehr, remaining in it until their thirty-second year. In time of war\r\nthey are liable to be called upon to serve with the regiment of the line\r\nof a corresponding number,--in fact, they form the reserve of that\r\nregiment whence reinforcements are drawn. From their thirty-second to\r\ntheir thirty-ninth year the men belong to the second levy, and are only\r\ncalled out occasionally in time of peace, but in war they garrison\r\nfortresses.\r\n\r\n=Lane.= The term applied to a body of soldiers in two ranks standing\r\nface to face, forming, in fact, a street, passage, or lane. The French\r\ncall this formation _haie_, or hedge. It is used when troops form a\r\nguard of honor for persons of rank to pass through.\r\n\r\n=Langensalza.= A town of Prussian Saxony, on the Salza, 20 miles\r\nnorthwest of Erfurt. The French and Saxons were here defeated by the\r\nPrussians in 1750; in 1761 the Prussians and English defeated the German\r\nimperial army; in 1813 the Prussians were defeated by the Bavarians; and\r\nin 1866, a bloody contest took place between the Prussians and\r\nHanoverians, resulting in the capture of the Hanoverian army as\r\nprisoners of war.\r\n\r\n=Langrel=, or =Langrage=. A villainous kind of shot, consisting of\r\nvarious fragments of iron bound together, so as to fit the bore of the\r\ncannon from which it is to be discharged. It is seldom used but by\r\nprivateers.\r\n\r\n=Languedoc= (anc. _Narbonensis Prima_). An old province of the south of\r\nFrance, bounded east by the river Rhone, and south by the Mediterranean.\r\nAs a Roman province it enjoyed the freedom of Italy. It formed part of\r\nGallia Narbonensis, but, in the Middle Ages, was known as _Septimania_,\r\nfrom the seven cathedral churches which it contained. From the hands of\r\nthe Romans it passed into the possession of the Goths; and being wrested\r\nfrom them, it was occupied by the Saracens till 725, when they were\r\nexpelled by Charles Martel. It afterwards came under the sway of Philip\r\nthe Bold, and became a part of the French Kingdom in 1361.\r\n\r\n=Languet=. A small slip of metal on the hilt of a sword, which overhangs\r\nthe scabbard; the ear of a sword.\r\n\r\n=Lansdown.= In Somersetshire, England. The Parliamentary army under Sir\r\nWilliam Waller was defeated here July 5, 1643.\r\n\r\n=Lansquenet.= A German foot-soldier; originally one of the serfs who\r\nfollowed the camp in the service of the common soldiers; afterward one\r\nof the independent troops who hired themselves to those willing to pay\r\nhighest for their services.\r\n\r\n=Lanterne= (_Fr._). Sometimes called _cuiller_, or ladle, serves to\r\nconvey gunpowder into a piece of ordnance. It is made of copper, and\r\nresembles a round spoon or ladle, which is fixed to a long pole.\r\n\r\n=Lanuvium= (now _Civita Lavinia_). An old and important city of Latium,\r\non the Appian Way, 20 miles south of Rome. Tradition describes it as a\r\ncolony from Alba; but it first rose to importance in the 5th century\r\nB.C., when it took part against Rome as one of the thirty cities of the\r\nLatin League. Its name again appears in the long wars between Rome and\r\nthe Æqui and Volsci, siding with the former; it changed sides in 383\r\nB.C., but was leniently treated by its old ally at the end of the war.\r\nIn the great Latin war, 340 B.C., it again took part against Rome, and\r\nin the general settlement at the close of hostilities, it obtained the\r\nRoman _civitas_.\r\n\r\n=Lanyards.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Laodicea ad Mare= (now _Ladikiyeh_). A city on the coast of Syria,\r\nabout 50 miles south from Antioch; was built by Seleucus I. on the site\r\nof an earlier city, called Ramitha. It was severely punished by Cassius\r\nfor its adherence to Dolabella, and again suffered in the Parthian\r\ninvasion of Syria. It was taken and destroyed by the Arabs in 1188.\r\n\r\n=Laon.= A town of France, in the department of the Aisne, 75 miles\r\nnortheast from Paris. It was besieged by the barbarians in 407; taken\r\nand sacked by Gelimer in 682; unsuccessfully besieged by the Normans in\r\n882; taken by Eudes, count of Paris, in 892, by Charles the Simple in\r\n895, and by Robert of France, who held it till 923. It was taken by the\r\nDuke of Burgundy in 1411; by the royal troops in 1414; surrendered in\r\n1419 by Philip the Good to the English, who were dispossessed in 1429.\r\nIt was unsuccessfully besieged by the Calvinists in 1567, and was taken\r\nby Henry IV. in 1594. On March 10, 1814, an indecisive battle was fought\r\nhere between the French troops under Napoleon, and the Prussians under\r\nBlücher.\r\n\r\n=Lapelle=, or =Lapel=. The facings of uniform coats were formerly so\r\ntermed. Until the introduction of epaulettes in 1812, the white lapelle\r\nwas synonymous with a lieutenant’s commission in the British service.\r\n\r\n=Lapithæ.= A wild race, inhabiting, in ancient times, the mountains of\r\nThessaly. They derived their name from a mythical ancestor, _Lapithes_,\r\na son of Apollo, and the brother of Centauros, the equally mythical\r\nancestor of the Centaurs. A bloody war is said to have been waged\r\nbetween the kindred races in prehistoric times, which ended in the\r\ndefeat of the Centaurs, but the Lapithæ were in their turn defeated by\r\nHercules.\r\n\r\n=Laplander.= An inhabitant of Lapland, a country of Northern Europe.\r\n\r\n=Lapse.= To fall in, or belong to. This expression was formerly used in\r\nthe British army to signify the reversion of any military property.\r\nThus, upon the sale or purchase of one commission at the regulated\r\ndifference, another (where there are two) is said to lapse to\r\ngovernment. Commissions lapse, or fall into the patronage of government,\r\nwhen vacancies happen by death, by officers being superseded, or where\r\nofficers apply to sell who have only purchased a part of their\r\ncommissions, and have not served long enough to be entitled to sell the\r\nwhole; in which case they are only permitted to sell what they actually\r\npurchased, and the remainder is in the gift of the government.\r\n\r\n=Lap-weld.= A weld in which the welding edges are made thin, lapped one\r\nover the other and welded.\r\n\r\n=Laranda= (now _Larenda_, or _Caraman_). A considerable town in the\r\nsouth of Lycaonia. It was taken by storm by Perdiccas, but afterwards\r\nrestored. It was used by the Isaurian robbers as one of their\r\nstrongholds.\r\n\r\n=Largs.= A seaport of Scotland, in Ayrshire, 23 miles southwest from\r\nGlasgow. Here, in 1263, Alexander III. of Scotland gained a victory over\r\nHaco, king of Norway.\r\n\r\n=Lariat.= The lasso, a long cord or thong of leather with a noose, used\r\nin catching wild horses and other animals. The term is now applied to a\r\nrope 1¹⁄₄ inches in circumference and 30 feet long, made of Italian\r\nhemp, which is used in the U. S. cavalry service to picket horses while\r\ngrazing.\r\n\r\n=La Roda.= A town of Spain, in the province of Murcia, 22 miles\r\nnorthwest from Albacete. This place is famous for the defense it made\r\nagainst the Carlists in 1840.\r\n\r\n=La Rothière= (France), =Battle of=. Took place between the French,\r\ncommanded by Napoleon, and the Prussian and Russian armies, which were\r\ndefeated with great loss after a desperate engagement, February 1, 1814.\r\nThis was one of Napoleon’s last victories.\r\n\r\n=Lascar.= In the East Indies, signifies properly a camp-follower, but is\r\ngenerally applied to native sailors on board of British ships. The\r\nLascars make good seamen, but being of an excessively irritable and\r\nrevengeful nature, are generally kept in the minority in a ship’s crew.\r\n\r\n=Lash.= To tie or bind with a rope or cord; to secure or fasten by a\r\nstring.\r\n\r\n=Lashes.= Formerly a general court-martial could sentence a soldier to\r\nreceive a certain number of lashes.

It was afterwards, with some change of boundary,\r\nmade over to Prussia, and by Prussia transferred to Denmark in 1815,\r\nwith reservation of rights. In 1870 it was re-annexed to Prussia.\r\n\r\n=Laufach.= In Bavaria, Southwestern Germany; it was taken by the\r\nPrussians, under Wrangel, July, 1860, after a sharp action, in which the\r\nHessians were defeated.\r\n\r\n=Launch.= To throw as a spear or dart; to send forth.

The French royalists of La Vendée took arms\r\nin March, 1793, and were successful in a number of hard-fought battles\r\nwith the republicans, between July 12, 1793, and January 1, 1794, when\r\nthey experienced a severe reverse. Their leader Henri, comte de\r\nLarochejaquelein, was killed March 4, 1794. A short peace was made at La\r\nJaunay, February 17, 1795. The war was terminated by Gen. Hoche in 1796.\r\nA treaty of peace was signed at Luçon, January 17, 1800.\r\n\r\n=Lavure= (_Fr._). The grains, dust, or detached pieces of metal which\r\nfall in casting cannon.\r\n\r\n=Law, Martial.= See MARTIAL LAW.\r\n\r\n=Law, Military.= A branch of the general municipal law, consisting of\r\nrules ordained for the government of the military forces of a state or\r\ngovernment, and those voluntarily serving with them, equally in peace\r\nand war, and administered by tribunals of special and limited\r\njurisdiction. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR.\r\n\r\n=Law of Arms.= Certain acknowledged rules, regulations, and precepts,\r\nwhich relate to war; and are observed by all civilized nations. The laws\r\nof arms also show how to proclaim war, to attack the enemy, and to\r\npunish offenders in the camp, etc.\r\n\r\n=Law of Nations.= Such general rules as regard the embassies, reception\r\nand entertainment of strangers, intercourse of merchants, exchange of\r\nprisoners, suspension of arms, etc.\r\n\r\n=Laws, Execution of.= On all occasions when the troops are employed in\r\nrestoring or maintaining public order among their fellow-citizens, the\r\nuse of arms, and particularly fire-arms, is obviously attended with loss\r\nof life or limb to private individuals; and for these consequences, a\r\nmilitary man may be called to stand at the bar of a criminal court. A\r\nprivate soldier also may occasionally be detached on special duty, with\r\nthe necessity of exercising discretion as to the use of his arms; and in\r\nsuch cases he is responsible, like an officer, for the right use or\r\nexercise of such discretion.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the public journals of London recorded the meritorious\r\nbehavior of a private sentry, upon the occasion of a riotous mob\r\nassembled at the entrance of Downing-Street with the intention of\r\nattacking the government offices in that quarter of the town. This man\r\nstanding alone presented his musket, and threatened to fire upon the\r\ncrowd, if the slightest attempt were made to approach the particular\r\noffice for the defense of which he was placed on duty, and succeeded by\r\nthe terror thus created, though at a great risk of consequences to\r\nhimself, in keeping the rioters at bay until a larger force arrived to\r\nassist him. The soldier’s conduct was publicly much approved. It was\r\nalso clearly legal according to Macadam’s case (a soldier tried before\r\nthe courts of Scotland in 1735); and if after the announcement of his\r\nintentions the mob had pressed forward to execute their purpose, he\r\nwould have been held justified at law in firing at the rioters upon his\r\nown responsibility. The Duke of Wellington, as Constable of the Tower,\r\ntestified his marked approbation of this man’s conduct, by promoting him\r\nat once to a wardership at that fortress.\r\n\r\nThe right of officers or soldiers to interfere in quelling a _felonious\r\nriot_, whether with or without superior military orders, or the\r\ndirection of a civil magistrate, is quite clear, and beyond the\r\npossibility of mistake. This subject, however, was formerly little\r\nunderstood; and military men failed in their public duty through excess\r\nof caution.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the existence of a clear right and duty on the part\r\nof military men voluntarily to aid in the suppression of a riot, it\r\nwould be the height of imprudence to intrude with military force, except\r\nupon the requisition of the proper authority, unless in those cases\r\nwhere the civil power is obviously overcome, or on the point of being\r\novercome, by the rioters.\r\n\r\nWhen the civil officer may not deem it safe to wait for the orders of\r\ngovernment, he should address his requisition for troops, not to any\r\nsubordinate military officer, but to the highest authority, to whom he\r\nshould communicate his object in making it, and all the information he\r\nmay possess regarding the strength and designs of those by whom the\r\npublic peace is menaced or disturbed. His duty is confined to these\r\npoints. _He has no authority in directing military operations._ The\r\nofficer commanding the troops has alone authority to determine the\r\nnumber and nature of those to be employed; the time and manner of making\r\nthe attack, and every other operation for the reduction of the enemy.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances can U. S. troops be called into service at the\r\n“polls.”\r\n\r\nIn the United States, regular troops can be ordered only to serve\r\nagainst rioters, or other lawless bands of citizens, under the orders of\r\nthe President to co-operate with the civil authorities.\r\n\r\nIt should ever be the aim of military men to attain the desired end by\r\nthe exercise of passive interposition.\r\n\r\n=Laws of War.= The recognized rules for the conduct of civilized\r\nwarfare. These rules relate to the treatment of prisoners,\r\nnon-combatants, spies, traitors, etc.; the disposition of private\r\nproperty, the rights of capture, occupation and conquest, the\r\nestablishment of blockades, the rights and obligations of neutrals, etc.\r\n\r\n=Lay.= To quit; to surrender the use of; as, lay down one’s arms. _To\r\nlay for_, is to attempt something by ambuscade.\r\n\r\n=Lay.= To point or aim; as, to lay a gun.

Three-sided tray or box without a cover, used to\r\ncarry powder from one mortar to another in powder-mills.\r\n\r\n=Lazarus.= A military order instituted at Jerusalem by the Christians of\r\nthe West, when they were masters of the Holy Land. They received\r\npilgrims under their care, and guarded them on the roads from the\r\ninsults of the Mohammedans. This order was instituted in the year 1119,\r\nand was confirmed by a bull of Pope Alexander IV. in 1255, who gave it\r\nthe rule of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n=Lazzaro, St.= In Northern Italy, where the king of Sardinia and the\r\nImperialists defeated the French and Spaniards after a long and severe\r\nconflict, June 4, 1746.\r\n\r\n=Lead.= To conduct as a chief or commander; as, let the troops follow\r\nwhere their general leads.\r\n\r\n=Lead Balls.= Are now generally made by compression, by means of\r\nmachinery, either at arsenals or at private establishments.\r\n\r\n=Lead Out.= A command in the mounted service to cause the horses to be\r\ntaken from the stable or picket line preparatory to mounting or\r\nharnessing.\r\n\r\n=Leader.= A chief, a commander; a captain.

On the day that\r\nKing Arthur won a great victory over the Saxons, Dewi is said to have\r\nordered the soldiers to place a leek in their caps.\r\n\r\n=Leesburg.= See BALL’S BLUFF.\r\n\r\n=Legatus.= Among the Romans, an ambassador, or lieutenant-general.\r\nLegati were of three kinds: (1) Those sent by foreign nations on an\r\nembassy to Rome. (2) Those sent from Rome on an embassy to foreign\r\ncountries or the provinces. (3) Those who served under Roman generals\r\nduring war, or under the pro-consuls and prætors in the provinces. The\r\nlatter kind was generally a person of high military skill, and was\r\nappointed by the consul, prætor, or dictator, under whom he was intended\r\nto serve. His nomination, however, was not legal until sanctioned by the\r\nsenate. His duty was to aid his superior officer, by advising him in all\r\ngreat emergencies, by acting as his substitute, both in civil and\r\nmilitary affairs, and by assuming his insignia as well as authority\r\nduring his absence. In the last case, he was called _legatus pro\r\nprætore_. The number of legati under one superior differed in proportion\r\nto the importance of the war or the extent of the province.\r\n\r\n=Leghorn= (It. _Livarno_). A large maritime town in Central Italy, in\r\nthe province of Leghorn. It was entered by the French army July 27,\r\n1796; evacuated by the French in 1799, and retaken in 1800. It was\r\nunsuccessfully attacked by the British and Italian forces in December,\r\n1813. The Austrians took the city from the insurgents May 12 and 13,\r\n1849, and quelled a slight insurrection, July, 1857.\r\n\r\n=Legion= (Lat. _legio_). A corps of soldiers in the Roman armies, first\r\nformed by Romulus, about 750 B.C., when it consisted of 3000 foot and\r\n300 horse. When Hannibal was in Italy, 216 B.C., the legion consisted of\r\n5200 soldiers; and under Marius, in 88 B.C., it was 6200 foot besides\r\n700 horse. There were 10, and sometimes as many as 18 legions kept at\r\nRome. Augustus had a standing army of 45 legions, together with 25,000\r\nhorse and 37,000 light-armed troops, about 5 B.C.; and the peace\r\nestablishment of Adrian was 30 of these formidable brigades. A legion\r\nwas divided into 10 cohorts, and every cohort into 6 centuries, with a\r\nvexillum, or standard, guarded by 10 men. The peace of Britain was\r\nprotected by 3 legions. The French army was divided into legions\r\nsubsequent to the reign of Francis I. See THUNDERING LEGIONS.\r\n\r\n=Legion of Honor, Order of the.= An order of merit instituted under the\r\nFrench republic in May, 1802, by the first consul, Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\nThe order originally comprised three classes,--grand officers,\r\ncommanders, and legionaries. The class of grand officers was, on the\r\ncoronation of Napoleon I., divided into Knights of the Grand Eagle and\r\ngrand officers. On the restoration of the Bourbons the Legion was\r\nremodeled so as to consist of four classes,--viz., grand officers, grand\r\ncrosses, commanders, and knights, but the order lost much of its\r\noriginal character. The order confers its distinction for civil and\r\nmilitary valor, but especially for the latter. The college of the Legion\r\nis in possession of considerable means, which have been augmented by the\r\naddition of property belonging to Louis Philippe. Out of this fund\r\npensions are paid to certain members of the order who have been wounded\r\nor who have undergone the amputation of a limb in service. These\r\npensions have sometimes amounted to as large a sum as 6,000,000 of\r\nfrancs annually.\r\n\r\n=Legionary.= Relating to or consisting of a legion or of legions; as, a\r\nlegionary force.\r\n\r\n=Legionary.= One of a legion.\r\n\r\n=Legnago.= A fortress on the Adige, Northern Italy, one of the\r\nquadrilateral.

During the civil war it was taken by Charles I.,\r\nMay 31, and by Fairfax, June 17, 1645.\r\n\r\n=Leinster.= A province of Ireland, occupying the southeast part of that\r\nisland. It was a kingdom in 1167. The abduction of Devorgilla, wife of\r\nO’Rourke, a lord of Connaught, by Dermot, king of Leinster, in 1152, is\r\nasserted to have led to the landing of the English, and the subsequent\r\nconquest. The province of Leinster gave the title of duke to Schomberg’s\r\nson in 1690. The title became extinct in 1719, and was conferred on the\r\nfamily of Fitzgerald in 1766.\r\n\r\n=Leipsic.= A city of the kingdom of Saxony, situated about 65 miles\r\nwest-northwest of Dresden, near the Prussian border, in a large and\r\nfertile plain. The Elster, the Pleisze, and the Parthe flow through or\r\npast the city, and unite about 3 miles below it. The city sprung up at\r\nthe junction of the Pleisze and the Parthe, and is first mentioned as a\r\ntown in 1015. It gradually increased in prosperity and importance. The\r\nfamous _Leipsic Conference_ between Luther, Eck, and Carlstadt, in 1519,\r\ngreatly tended to the promotion of the Reformation. It suffered greatly\r\nin the Thirty Years’ War, in which it was five times besieged and taken,\r\nand again in the Seven Years’ War; and although the commercial changes\r\nconnected with the French revolution at first affected it very\r\nfavorably, yet it suffered not a little amidst the terrible struggle of\r\nthe years 1812 and 1813, when it was alternately in possession of the\r\nFrench and of the allies. The immediate neighborhood of Leipsic has\r\nbeen the scene of two battles of great importance in the history of\r\nGermany and of Europe,--the battle of Leipsic, or of Breitenfeld (see\r\nBREITENFELD), on September 7, 1631, and the great battle called the\r\n_Battle of the Nations_, which continued for three days, October 16-18,\r\n1813. The latter was one of the most bloody and decisive of those which\r\neffected the deliverance of Europe from French domination. The troops\r\nunder Napoleon in this battle amounted to about 180,000 men, and those\r\nof the allies, commanded by Prince Schwarzenberg, Marshal Blücher, and\r\nBernadotte, crown-prince of Sweden, to almost 300,000. About 2000 pieces\r\nof artillery were brought to the field. The loss of the French was\r\nreckoned at about 38,000 killed and wounded, and 30,000 prisoners; that\r\nof the allies to about 48,000. The victory of the allies was complete;\r\nthe French being compelled to evacuate Leipsic, and to retreat.\r\n\r\n=Leith.= A town of Scotland, 2 miles northeast from Edinburgh, of which\r\nit is the seaport. It was burned in 1541 by an English fleet, and in\r\n1549 it was occupied by French troops, who came to the assistance of\r\nMary of Guise.\r\n\r\n=Leleges.= An ancient race which inhabited Greece before the Hellenes,\r\nand are mentioned along with the Pelasgians as the most ancient\r\ninhabitants. They were a warlike and migratory race, and piracy was\r\ntheir chief occupation. The Leleges must be regarded as a branch of the\r\ngreat Indo-Germanic race, who became incorporated with the Hellenes, and\r\nthus ceased to exist as an independent people.\r\n\r\n=Length of Cannon.= Is the distance from the rear of the base-ring to\r\nthe face of the piece, and the _extreme length_ is from the rear of the\r\ncascabel to the face.\r\n\r\n=Lengthen.= To extend in length; to make longer; to elongate; as, to\r\nlengthen a line of troops. _To lengthen the step_, to take more than the\r\nprescribed pace.\r\n\r\n=Lenni-Lenape.= See DELAWARES.\r\n\r\n=Lens.= A parish and town of France, in the department Pas-de-Calais, 9\r\nmiles from Arras.

A city of Sicily, situated between Syracuse\r\nand Catania. In 427 B.C., the Lentinians applied to the Athenians for\r\nsupport against Syracuse; they were sent twenty ships, under the command\r\nof Laches and Charœades. In 215 B.C., they raised their standard of open\r\nwar against Rome; but Marcellus hastened to attack the city, and made\r\nhimself master of it without difficulty. Under the Roman government it\r\nwas restored to the position of an independent town.\r\n\r\n=Leon.= A province of Spain, subdivided into the smaller provinces of\r\nSalamanca, Zumor, and Leon. The kingdom of Leon was erected in 746, by\r\nAlfonso the Catholic, out of the provinces he had wrested from the\r\nSaracens and the older kingdom of Asturias, and in 1230 it was\r\npermanently united to Castile. During the Peninsular war it suffered\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\n=Lepanto= (anc. _Naupactus_). Called by the Greek peasants Epakto, a\r\nseaport town of Greece, 12 miles northeast from Patras. The name\r\nNaupactus is said to have originated with the Heraclidæ, who are\r\nreported to have there built the fleet with which they invaded the\r\nPeloponnesus. After the Persian war it fell into the possession of the\r\nAthenians, who settled it with the expatriated Messenians. The Athenians\r\nmade it their chief military station in Western Greece during the\r\nPeloponnesian war. At its close Lepanto was taken by the Locrians, and\r\nafterwards passed in succession through the hands of the Etolians,\r\nMacedonians, Achæans, and Romans. In 1475 it was invested by the Turks,\r\nwho, after the loss of 30,000 men in four months, were forced to raise\r\nthe siege. Within the Gulf of Lepanto, in 1571, was fought the great\r\nnaval engagement between the Ottomans and the Christian powers of the\r\nMediterranean, under Don John of Austria, in which the former lost about\r\n200 galleys and 20,000 men.\r\n\r\n=Lerida.= A town of Spain, in Catalonia, on the Segre, 80 miles\r\nnorthwest from Barcelona.

At the head of 40,000 men Muncer\r\ncommanded the sovereign princes of Germany and the magistrates of cities\r\nto resign their authority; and on his march his followers ravaged the\r\ncountry. The landgrave of Hesse at last defeated him; 7000 of the\r\nenthusiasts fell in battle, and the rest fled; their leader was taken\r\nand beheaded at Mulhausen in 1525.

When a country is in danger of instant invasion, a _levée en\r\nmasse_ is sometimes made,--_i.e._, every man capable of bearing arms is\r\nrequired to contribute in person towards the common defense. On less\r\nurgent occasions, the levy may be restricted to a class, as to men\r\nbetween eighteen and forty years of age. At other times, a levy of so\r\nmany thousand men of a certain age is decreed, and the districts\r\nconcerned draw them by lot from among their eligible male population. In\r\narmies sustained by volunteering, the levy, which is a remnant of\r\nbarbarous times, is unnecessary; but the system was frequently resorted\r\nto in France before the enactment of the conscription laws. In 1862-64\r\nthere were great levies in the United States of America; and in any\r\ncountry where great danger is apparent, and volunteers are not\r\nsufficiently numerous, recourse must at all times be had to a levy of\r\nthe people. This term is also applied to the assessment of taxes, tolls,\r\nor contributions.\r\n\r\n=Levy.= To raise or collect troops or funds by a levy.

At last the\r\nPrince of Orange came to their rescue. The dykes were opened, and the\r\nwaters, which drowned a great number of the besiegers, carried a fleet\r\nof 200 boats loaded with provisions to the city.

Several of these lieutenants, who had military employment\r\nunder the board of ordnance, received the rank of lieutenant-general in\r\nthe army from the king, and could rise to the most exalted stations in\r\ncommon with other officers.\r\n\r\n=Lieutenant-Colonel.= His rank corresponds with that of commanders in\r\nthe navy. See COLONEL, LIEUTENANT-.\r\n\r\n=Lieutenant-General.= His rank is equivalent to that of a vice-admiral.\r\nSee GENERAL, LIEUTENANT-.\r\n\r\n=Life-guard.= A guard of the life or person; a guard that attends the\r\nperson of a prince, or other high officer or dignitary; a body-guard.\r\nSee GUARDS.\r\n\r\n=Light Battery.= A mounted battery of field-guns.\r\n\r\n=Light Bobs.= In the British service, a familiar term used for the light\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\n=Light Horse.= All mounted soldiers that are lightly armed and accoutred\r\nfor active and desultory service, may be considered under this term.\r\nThus light dragoons, hussars, mounted riflemen, etc., are strictly\r\nspeaking light horse.\r\n\r\n=Light Infantry.= A body of armed men selected and trained for rapid\r\nevolutions; often employed to cover and assist other troops. See\r\nINFANTRY, LIGHT.\r\n\r\n=Light Infantry Company.= In the British service, a company of active,\r\nstrong men, carefully selected from the rest of the regiment. It always\r\noccupies its place on the left of the battalion until called for. When\r\nthe call sounds, the light company orders arms and unfixes bayonets\r\nwithout word of command, and remains in readiness to move.\r\n\r\n=Light Marching Order.= A soldier paraded with arms, ammunition,\r\ncanteen, and haversack, is said to be in light marching order.\r\n\r\n=Light Troops.= By this term is generally meant all troops which are\r\nlightly accoutred for detached service.\r\n\r\n=Light, Velocity of.= It has been proven by astronomers that light\r\ntravels through space with the prodigious, though finite, velocity of\r\n192,500, or nearly 200,000 miles in a second of time, and consequently\r\nwould pass round the earth in the eighth part of a second. It is also\r\nproved, by the phenomena of aberration, that the light of the sun,\r\nplanets, and all the fixed stars, travels with the same velocity.\r\n\r\n=Light-armed.= Not heavily armed, or armed with _light_ weapons; as,\r\nlight troops; a troop of light horse. See INFANTRY, LIGHT-ARMED.\r\n\r\n=Light-ball.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Light-barrel.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Ligny.= A village in Belgium, in the province of Namur, about 10 miles\r\nnortheast of Charleroi, famous on account of the battle fought here by\r\nthe French under Napoleon, and the Prussians under Blücher, June 16,\r\n1815, in which the latter was defeated.\r\n\r\n=Liguria.= In ancient geography, a region of Northern Italy, the land of\r\nthe Ligurians It is first mentioned by the early Greek authors as\r\nextending as far westward as the mouths of the Rhone, while according to\r\nPolybius, its eastern boundary was Pisæ, and its northern the country of\r\nthe Arretines. The Ligurians, so often praised by ancient authors for\r\ntheir hardihood and bravery, are generally understood to be those on the\r\nsouth side of the Apennines exclusively. In the time of Strabo these\r\neked out the scanty produce of their stony and sterile soil by hunting\r\nand feeding flocks, and thus fostered that vigor of frame and ferocity\r\nof disposition which long rendered them the indomitable foes and\r\nplunderers of the Romans. They were renowned as slingers and light\r\ninfantry in the armies of the Carthaginians, and afterwards in those of\r\nthe Romans. They were conquered by the Romans in 125 B.C. Liguria formed\r\nthe first point of the Roman province of Gaul; in 1797, in consequence\r\nof the conquests of Bonaparte, it was formed into the republic of\r\nLiguria.\r\n\r\n=Limber.= To attach to the limbers; as, to limber the gun; to limber up.\r\n\r\n=Limber-chest.= The ammunition-chest placed on the limber of\r\nfield-pieces.\r\n\r\n=Limbers.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Limenarque= (_Fr._).

It has always been deemed a place of\r\nimportance. It was taken by the English in 1174; in 1651 it was taken by\r\nIreton, the son-in-law of Cromwell; in 1690 it was unsuccessfully\r\nbesieged by King William III. in person; in 1691 it surrendered to Gen.\r\nGinkel, afterwards earl of Athlone. Before the Conquest it was the seat\r\nof the kings of Thomond.\r\n\r\n=Limitary.= A guard or superintendent, placed at the confines or\r\nboundaries of any kingdom or state.\r\n\r\n=Limitation of Time of Prosecution.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 103.\r\n\r\n=Limites Romani.= The name of a continuous series of fortifications,\r\nconsisting of castles, walls, earthen ramparts, and the like, which the\r\nRomans erected along the Rhine and the Danube, to protect their\r\npossessions from the attacks of the Germans.\r\n\r\n=Limits.= In a military sense, is that which bounds or confines; as, the\r\nlimits of a sentinel’s post; the limits of a garrison.

A hook attached to the head of the pin\r\nand embracing the axle-arm prevents the pin from being jolted out.\r\n\r\n=Linch-pin Washer.= A ring against which the linch pin rubs.\r\n\r\n=Lincoln= (anc. _Lindum Colonia_). A city of England, the capital of\r\nLincolnshire, on the Witham. It was at the period of the Conquest rich\r\nand populous. It was taken several times by Saxons and Danes. Without\r\nNewport-gate, upon Lincoln plain, was fought the battle between the\r\npartisans of the empress Maud, commanded by the Earl of Gloucester, and\r\nthe army of Stephen, in which the king was defeated and taken prisoner,\r\nFebruary 2, 1141. Lincoln was the scene of important operations during\r\nthe civil wars in the reign of King John; and here the party of the\r\nDauphin was completely overthrown by the Earl of Pembroke during the\r\nminority of Henry III. During the great civil war the royalists obtained\r\npossession of the city, but it was stormed by the Parliamentary army\r\nunder the Earl of Manchester, May 5, 1644.\r\n\r\n=Linden-tree.= The wood used in artificial fireworks, etc.\r\n\r\n=Lindisfarne.= See HOLY ISLAND.\r\n\r\n=Line.= Various opinions have been given as to what portion of the\r\nmilitary establishment should constitute the _line_ of the army, and in\r\nthe absence of legislation, which should settle the question, it will\r\ncontinue to be a subject of controversy, and some difficulty has arisen\r\nfrom the vague and uncertain meaning of the words “line of the army,”\r\nwhich neither in the English service nor in the United States have a\r\nwell-defined meaning. The opinion that the words are intended to\r\ndistinguish the regular army from the militia, or discriminate between\r\nofficers by brevet and those by ordinary commissions, as understood by\r\nsome, would seem to be erroneous. Though the words “line of the army”\r\nmay sometimes be used in a different sense, the opinion prevails that in\r\nthe 122d Article of War they are used to designate those officers of the\r\narmy who do not belong to the staff, in contradistinction to those who\r\ndo. It is now generally conceded that the law contemplates that the\r\nfighting portion of the army; as cavalry, artillery, infantry, and\r\nengineers, or that part of the service organized or subdivided into\r\nunits for command, as well as the commanders thereof, constitutes the\r\n“line of the army.” The four arms of the service above mentioned form\r\nthe principal part of a mobilized army, and as they are always formed\r\ninto a line of battle to resist the attack of an enemy, or to make an\r\nattack, they are generally known as the “line of the army,” or “troops\r\nof the line,” to distinguish them from other bodies of men who form\r\nparts of an army.\r\n\r\n=Line.= In the British service, the regular infantry of an army, as\r\ndistinguished from militia, volunteer corps, artillery, cavalry, etc.\r\n\r\n=Line.= In tactics, a body of men in either one or two ranks; generally\r\na body of troops drawn up with an extended front. _To line_, is to place\r\ntroops in line (see ALIGN); thus, _to line_ hedges or walls, is to place\r\ntroops behind them. _To form the line_, in land tactics, is to arrange\r\nthe troops in order of battle, or battle array. _To break the line_, to\r\nchange the direction from that of a straight line, in order to obtain a\r\ncross-fire, and for other purposes. _To line a street or road_, is to\r\ndraw up any number of men on each side of the street or road, and to\r\nface them inwards. This is frequently practiced on days of ceremony,\r\nwhen some distinguished person is received with military honors on his\r\nway through places where troops are stationed. This is the usage also in\r\nfunerals, when the corps under arms form a line facing inwards.\r\n\r\n=Line.= In fencing, an imaginary line opposite to the fencer, wherein\r\nthe shoulders, right arm, and the sword should always be found, and\r\nwherein are also to be placed the two feet at the distance of 18 inches\r\napart. In which sense a man is said to be in his _line_, or to go out of\r\nhis line, etc.\r\n\r\n=Line.= A cord or rope; as, a picket line, side lines (which see).\r\n\r\n=Line, Horizontal.= A line parallel to the plane of the horizon; as, any\r\nline in the level surface of a plane.\r\n\r\n=Line, Inclined.= Is a line which is oblique to the plane of the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n=Line, Magistral.= See MAGISTRAL LINE.\r\n\r\n=Line, Oblique.= A straight line which is neither parallel nor\r\nperpendicular to another line; also a line of troops posted or marching\r\nobliquely.\r\n\r\n=Line of Battle.= The position of troops drawn up in their usual order\r\nwithout any determined manœuvre.\r\n\r\n=Line of Counter-approach.= A sort of trench which the besieged make,\r\nand push forward from the glacis, for the purpose of counteracting the\r\nenemy’s works.\r\n\r\n=Line of Defense.= See DEFENSE, LINE OF.\r\n\r\n=Line of Demarcation.= A line which is drawn by consent, to ascertain\r\nthe limits of lands or territories belonging to different powers.\r\n\r\n=Line of Direction.= In gunnery, was a line formerly marked upon guns,\r\nby a short point upon the muzzle, and a cavity on the base-ring, to\r\ndirect the eye in pointing the gun.\r\n\r\n=Line of Duty.= An officer or soldier disabled while performing properly\r\nauthorized duty is said to be injured in line of duty, and as such is\r\nentitled to the allowances fixed by law.\r\n\r\n=Line of Fire.= In gunnery, the axis of the gun produced.\r\n\r\n=Line of Fire.= In fortification, this term admits of two distinct\r\nacceptations: first, when it is found necessary to give an idea of the\r\nmanner in which a rampart or an intrenchment covers any space of ground\r\nby the discharge of ordnance or musketry, lines must be drawn to express\r\nthe distances traversed by the shot, etc. These lines are called lines\r\nof fire, being representations of the actual ranges; second, all that\r\nextent of a rampart or intrenchment from which the projectiles of\r\nordnance or musketry are discharged, is understood to be the line of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n=Line of Least Resistance.= The shortest distance from the centre of the\r\ncharge of a mine to the open air.\r\n\r\n=Line of March.= Arrangement for marching. Course or direction taken by\r\nan army.\r\n\r\n=Line of Metal.= Or natural line of sight, is a line drawn from the\r\nhighest point of the base-ring or base-line to the highest point of the\r\nswell of the muzzle, or to the top of the sight, if there be one. The\r\nline of sight nearest to the axis of the piece is the _natural_ line of\r\nsight, the others are _artificial_ lines of sight. See ARTIFICIAL LINE\r\nOF SIGHT.\r\n\r\n=Line of Sight.= See LINE OF METAL and POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Line of the Bastion, Capital.= Is a line which bisects the salient\r\nangle of a bastion. See CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n=Line, Retiring.= A line of troops in orderly retreat.\r\n\r\n=Line, Tangent.= A straight line, which meets a curve at one point and\r\ntouches without cutting it.\r\n\r\n=Line, Vertical.= A line which is perpendicular to the horizon. Of this\r\ndescription are all lines that express height or depth.\r\n\r\n=Lineal, or Linear.= Pertaining to length; pertaining to the line of an\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n=Lineal Rank.= Is the rank of a line-officer in his arm of the service.\r\n\r\n=Linear Promotion.= Is promotion of line-officers according to seniority\r\nin the arm of service, as opposed to promotion in the regiment.\r\n\r\n=Line-firings.= This term is used when troops fire by line.\r\n\r\n=Lines.= A series of field-works, either continuous or at intervals. The\r\nformer are connected by means of curtains or straight walls. The rule in\r\nconstructing the other is, that the works shall be within cannon- or\r\nmusket-shot range of each other, according to their armament.\r\n\r\n=Lines, Close and Open.= Formerly when troops were drawn up in order of\r\nbattle with intervals between the battalions and squadrons, the lines\r\nwere said to be close and open.\r\n\r\n=Lines, Continued.= A continued line of field-works constructed for the\r\ndefense of a position.\r\n\r\n=Lines Cremaillere.= Are composed of alternate short and long faces at\r\nright angles to each other.\r\n\r\n=Lines, Full or Close.= Are lines of men drawn up without leaving\r\nintervals between them.\r\n\r\n=Lines, Inside.= Are a kind of ditches towards the place, to prevent\r\nsallies, etc.\r\n\r\n=Lines of Bastion.= As the name indicates, are formed of a succession of\r\nbastion-shaped parapets, each consisting of two faces and two flanks,\r\nconnected by a curtain.\r\n\r\n=Lines of Circumvallation.= The defensive works by which a besieging\r\narmy covers its rear and flanks against a relieving force.\r\n\r\n=Lines of Communication.= Are trenches that unite one work to another,\r\nso that men may pass between them without being exposed to the enemy’s\r\nfire; hence, the whole intrenchment round any place is sometimes called\r\na line of communication, because it leads to all the works.\r\n\r\n=Lines of Communication.= This term is applied to all the practicable\r\nroutes and roads connecting the different parts of an army occupying the\r\ntheatre of war. Therefore, as the army moves from its base, the lines of\r\noperations become lines of communication, and since these “lines of\r\noperations” are generally the longest and most important lines of\r\ncommunication, it is to them that the simple term “communications”\r\ngenerally refers. All the routes used by the trains employed in\r\nprovisioning an army, form a part of the communications. The most\r\nimportant, safest, and most convenient of these routes, all other things\r\nbeing equal, will be the central one, or the one leading from the centre\r\nof the army back to its base. This particular route is sometimes\r\ndesignated as the “line of supplies.”--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Lines of Contravallation.= See CONTRAVALLATION.\r\n\r\n=Lines of Operations.= The roads or routes by which an army moves from\r\nits base towards its objective-point have been designated by the term\r\n“lines of operations.” Lines of operations are classified from their\r\nnumber into _single_, _double_, or _multiple_ lines; from their\r\npositions with respect to the lines of operations of the enemy into\r\n_interior_ or _exterior_ lines; and from their position with respect to\r\neach other into _convergent_ or _divergent_ lines. Other classifications\r\nare sometimes used descriptive of the nature or other quality of the\r\nline.\r\n\r\n_Single Line of Operations._--An army moving in a given direction with\r\nall its parts united, or with those parts so situated that they can be\r\nreadily joined when required, is said to use a “single line of\r\noperations.” Sometimes this line is called a _simple_ line. A single\r\nline of operations does not mean a _single road_, but embraces all the\r\nroads or routes taken by the fractions of the army for the purpose of\r\nreaching a common point of concentration; the condition being imposed\r\nthat these roads shall not be so far apart, or have intervening such\r\nobstacles, that the different parts of an army will be prevented from\r\nuniting at any given time which may be appointed.\r\n\r\n_Double and Multiple Lines of Operations._--When there are obstacles\r\nintervening between the roads or routes passed over by an army, or the\r\nroads are so far apart as to prevent the parts of the army from being\r\nreadily united, the army is then said to employ “double” or “multiple”\r\nlines of operations.\r\n\r\n_Interior Lines of Operations._--If these lines are within those\r\nemployed by the enemy, they are known as “interior” lines.\r\n\r\n_Exterior Lines of Operations._--If these lines are outside of the lines\r\nemployed by the enemy, they are called “exterior” lines.\r\n\r\n_Convergent Lines of Operations._--If these lines of operations start\r\nfrom points some distance apart, approach each other, and meet at some\r\npoint in advance, they are called “convergent.” Sometimes the term\r\n“concentric” is employed to designate them.\r\n\r\n_Divergent Lines of Operations._--These lines are the reverse of\r\nconvergent lines, as they continue to separate, or the distance between\r\nthem to widen, as the army advances. The term “eccentric” is also\r\napplied to them.\r\n\r\n_Accidental Lines of Operations._--Lines of operations are sometimes\r\nemployed different from those proposed in the original plan of campaign.\r\nTo these lines the term “accidental” is applied. It does not follow that\r\ntheir adoption is a matter of accident, as might be inferred from their\r\nname. They are frequently the result of a change in the original plan,\r\nwhich probable change was foreseen and provided for.\r\n\r\n_Temporary Lines of Operations._--Sometimes an army in making a movement\r\nemploys a line which deviates from that adopted in the general plan of\r\ncampaign. As soon as the movement is completed the original lines are\r\nresumed. Such line adopted for such movement is termed a “temporary\r\nline.” The term “manœuvre line” is also applied to it.--_Prof. J. B.\r\nWheeler._\r\n\r\n=Lines of Retreat.= The roads passed over as the army advances are\r\nordinarily the roads taken when the army retires or is driven back. In\r\nthe latter case they are known as “lines of retreat,” and are “single,”\r\n“double,” “diverging,” etc., according to their number and\r\nposition.--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Lines of Tenailles.= Consist of parapets, forming a series of salient\r\nand re-entering angles.\r\n\r\n=Lines of Torres Vedras.= See TORRES VEDRAS.\r\n\r\n=Lines Outside.= Are a kind of ditches towards the field, to hinder\r\nrelief, etc.\r\n\r\n=Lines, Strategical.= The lines followed by an army in making a\r\nstrategical movement are called “strategical lines.” Temporary lines of\r\noperations, or manœuvre lines, therefore, are strategical lines. Lines\r\nof operations are important strategical lines. And in general, lines\r\nconnecting two or more strategical points, which lines can be used by an\r\narmy, and which allow of easy communication between these points, are\r\n“strategical lines.” A base of operations is therefore a strategical\r\nline.--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Lines with Intervals.= One or more rows of field-works with large\r\nintervals between them, through which the offensive may be assumed.\r\n\r\n=Linesmen.= In the British service, infantrymen of the regular army are\r\nso called.\r\n\r\n=Lingerer.= One who pretends to be indisposed, in order to avoid his\r\ntour of duty,--a skulker. Hence the term malingerer, or a soldier who\r\navoids duty in a disreputable manner.\r\n\r\n=Linlithgow-bridge.= Near Edinburgh, Scotland, near which the forces of\r\nthe Earl of Angus, who held James V. in their power, defeated the forces\r\nof the Earl of Lennox, who, after receiving promise of quarter, was\r\nkilled by Sir James Hamilton, 1526.\r\n\r\n=Linstock.= A short staff of wood, about 3 feet long, having at one end\r\na piece of iron divided into two branches, each of which has a notch to\r\nhold a lighted match, and a screw to fasten it there, the other end\r\nbeing shod with iron to stick into the ground.\r\n\r\n=Linstock Socket.= A socket attached to the piece in which the linstock\r\nwas formerly carried.\r\n\r\n=Lipan Indians.= A warlike tribe of aborigines residing in Texas and\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n=Lippe=, or =Lippe Detmold=. A small principality of Northwest Germany,\r\nthe chief part of which is comprised between Prussian Westphalia,\r\nHanover, and the principality Pyrmont. The surface is hilly, partly\r\ncovered by the Teutoburger Wald, where Arminius exterminated the legions\r\nof Varus.\r\n\r\n=Lis= (_Fr._). A warlike machine was formerly so called. It consisted of\r\na piece of wood or a stake, about the size of the human body, which was\r\nmade smaller at the top than at the bottom, and resembled a lily not yet\r\nblown. Several of these were tied together with ozier or willow twigs,\r\nand were used for the security of a camp. They were not unlike the\r\npalisades of the present day.\r\n\r\n=Lisaine.= A small river in France, rising in the Vosges Mountains, and\r\nflowing west of the fortress of Belfort. On January 15, 16, and 17,\r\n1871, a terrible contest raged here between the French army under\r\nBourbaki and the Germans under Von Werder, the French being finally\r\ncompelled to retreat. The German loss was about 2000; the French about\r\n6000.\r\n\r\n=Lisbon.= The capital of Portugal, situated on the north bank of the\r\nTagus, near its mouth in the Atlantic. In 1807 it was occupied by the\r\nFrench, and was afterwards the scene of important operations between\r\nthe British and French armies, until the latter were finally driven from\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n=Lisburn.= A town of Ireland, in the county of Antrim, on the Lagan, 8\r\nmiles southwest from Belfast. It was founded in 1627, and in 1641 was\r\nlaid in ashes by the Irish insurgents. It was again burnt in 1707.\r\n\r\n=Lisieux.= A town of France, in the department Calvados, situated near\r\nthe confluence of the Orbec and the Tanque. The Normans pillaged it in\r\nthe 8th century, and retained it for a considerable time. It has since\r\nbeen frequently besieged and captured, and was last taken by Henri\r\nQuatre in 1588.\r\n\r\n=Lisle=, or =Lille=. A city of France, formerly the capital of French\r\nFlanders, and now of the department of the North. It was founded in 1009\r\nby Baudouin IV., count of Flanders. It fell into the power of Philip the\r\nFair, after a siege of three months in 1297, and was taken again by Guy,\r\ncount of Flanders, in 1302. The Protestants attempted in vain to\r\nsurprise it in 1581, and the French besieged it without success in 1645.\r\nWrested from the Spaniards by Louis XIV. in 1667, and retaken by the\r\nallies in 1708, after a long and obstinate siege, it was ceded to France\r\nby the treaty of Utrecht. The Austrians bombarded it from September 29\r\ntill October 6, 1792, but the garrison, admirably supported by the\r\nbravery of the inhabitants, compelled them to raise the siege.\r\n\r\n=Lissa.= A town of Prussian Poland, near the borders of Silesia. This\r\nplace was laid in ruins by the Russian army in the campaign of 1707.\r\n\r\n=Lissa.= A mountainous island of Austria, in the Gulf of Venice, near\r\nthe coast of Dalmatia, held by the British from 1810 to 1815. Near here\r\nthe Italian fleet, commanded by Persano, was defeated with severe loss\r\nby the Austrian fleet, commanded by Tegethoff, July 20, 1866.\r\n\r\n=List.= A roll or catalogue; as, the army-list, the pay list, etc.\r\n\r\n=List.= A line inclosing or forming the extremity of a piece of ground,\r\nor field of combat; hence, in the plural (lists), the ground or field\r\ninclosed for a race or combat. _To enter the lists_, to accept a\r\nchallenge, or engage in a contest.\r\n\r\n=List.= To engage in the public service by enrolling one’s name, as\r\nsoldiers; to inclose for combat; as, to list a field.\r\n\r\n=Litana Silva= (now _Silva di Luge_). A large forest on the Apennines,\r\nin Cisalpine Gaul, southeast of Mutina, in which the Romans were\r\ndefeated by the Gauls, 216 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Litter= (Lat. _lectica_, from _lectus_, “bed”). According to Rees’s\r\nCyclopædia, a kind of vehicle borne upon shafts, anciently esteemed the\r\nmost easy and genteel way of carriage. It was much in use among the\r\nRomans, among whom it was borne by slaves kept for that purpose, as it\r\nstill continues to be in the East, where it is called a _palanquin_. The\r\ninvention of litters, according to Cicero, was owing to the kings of\r\nBithynia. In the time of Tiberius they had become very frequent at\r\nRome, as appears from Seneca. Horse-litters were much used in Europe\r\nprior to the introduction of coaches. In the military service the litter\r\nis a species of hurdle bed, on which the wounded are sometimes carried\r\nfrom the field of battle. What is known as the hand-litter or stretcher\r\nis used to carry men from where they fall in battle to field hospitals.\r\nThe hand-litter or stretcher is generally constructed with canvas about\r\n6¹⁄₂ feet long by 3 feet wide, the sides securely fastened to two\r\nhard-wood poles about 8 feet in length; the two cross-pieces should be\r\nconstructed so that the litter can be rolled up. Small outlying bodies\r\nof troops, especially detachments of cavalry, are not always provided\r\nwith them; for these the hand-litter, made with guns and blankets, has\r\nbeen extemporized; for this purpose the edges of the blanket are rolled\r\nover the guns, and tied firmly with twine, and two stout sticks are also\r\ntied across at the head and foot, serving as handles for the bearers.\r\nThis being laid on the ground, the wounded man is placed upon it, with\r\nhis knapsack under his head. The Indian litter is made by taking two\r\nstout saplings, and attaching to them three cross-pieces, about 2¹⁄₂ or\r\n3 feet apart, by cords and notches; the sick or wounded man being placed\r\non his blanket, this frame-work is placed over him, and the blanket\r\nknotted to it. By three bent twigs and an additional blanket, a kind of\r\ntop can be made to this in case of a storm. Several kinds of horse or\r\nmule litters for frontier service have been invented, but none seem so\r\nwell adapted for all purposes as the one invented by Surgeon J. C.\r\nBaily, U.S.A. Ambulance litters are so constructed as to be drawn from\r\nthe ambulance and taken to the wounded man, who is by it conveyed to the\r\nvehicle. It is then slid into place on rollers, and steadied by loops\r\nand guys.\r\n\r\n=Little Fortification.= The first division of the first system of\r\nVauban, and is so called when the exterior side of a fortification does\r\nnot exceed 350 yards. It is used in the construction of citadels, small\r\nforts, horn- and crown-works.\r\n\r\n=Living Force.= _Vis viva._ That force of a body in motion which\r\ndetermines the work of which it is capable. Living force is measured by\r\nthe product of the mass into the square of the velocity.\r\n\r\n=Livonia.= A Russian province on the Baltic Sea, first visited by some\r\nBremen merchants about 1158. It has belonged successively to Denmark,\r\nSweden, Poland, and Russia. It was finally ceded to Peter the Great in\r\n1721.\r\n\r\n=Liziere.= The berme of a parapet. See BERME.\r\n\r\n=Llandeweyer.= In Caermarthenshire, Wales. Here Llewellyn, prince of\r\nWales, having descended into the plains, was surprised, defeated, and\r\nslain by the lords-marchers, December 11, 1282. This disaster led to the\r\nsubjugation of Wales in 1283.\r\n\r\n=Llerena.= An ancient town of Spain, in the province of Estremadura, 59\r\nmiles north from Seville. Near this place, the English under Combermere\r\ndefeated the French under Drouet in 1812.\r\n\r\n=Load.= The charge of a fire-arm; as, a load of powder.\r\n\r\n=Load.= To place a charge in; to charge, as a gun, with powder, or with\r\npowder and shot, or ball.\r\n\r\n=Load.= A word of command given when men are to charge their guns or\r\nrifles.\r\n\r\n=Loading.= The process of loading field-shells is as follows: They are\r\nset up on their sabots, the charges measured out in the proper\r\npowder-measure, and poured in through a copper funnel. The fuze-plugs\r\nare then driven in with a mallet, allowing the tops to project about 0.1\r\ninch, care being taken not to split them. The holes in the plugs are\r\nthen carefully reamed out, and stopped with tow wads, which are pressed\r\nin firmly with a round stick.\r\n\r\n_Process of loading spherical case-shot_: The shot having been cleaned,\r\nthe balls are put in. A stick with a less diameter than the fuze-hole,\r\nand having a groove on each side of it, is inserted and pushed to the\r\nbottom of the cavity by working the balls aside. The shot is then placed\r\nin a sand-bath or oven, and brought to a proper temperature to receive\r\nthe sulphur, which, in a melted state, is poured in to fill up the\r\ninterstices between the balls; the shot is allowed to cool and the\r\nsulphur to harden, when the stick is withdrawn, and the sulphur adhering\r\nto the sides of the eye and the surface of the shot is removed. If a\r\nfuze-plug and paper fuze are to be used, the charge is poured in, and\r\nthe plug inserted exactly as in case of a shell; but, if the\r\nBormann-fuze is to be used, the charge is inserted, and the stopper and\r\nfuze screwed into their places, care being taken before placing the fuze\r\nin position to puncture the covering of the magazine, so that the fire\r\ncan communicate with the charge. Spherical-case are now usually loaded\r\nby putting in the bullets and pouring melted sulphur or rosin in until\r\nthe case is full. After the sulphur has cooled, the space for the powder\r\nis bored out by a cutter, which removes both the sulphur and portions of\r\nthe bullets from the space. This is a quicker method, and gives a more\r\ncompact projectile. Case-shot for rifle guns are filled in a similar\r\nmanner. The object of the sulphur or rosin is to solidify the mass of\r\nbullets, and preventing them from striking by their inertia against the\r\nsides of the case, and cracking it, when the piece is fired. Coal-dust\r\nis sometimes used instead of sulphur or rosin. Round, leaden balls,\r\nseventeen to the pound, are used.\r\n\r\n_Process of filling mortar-shells_: Having been inspected to see that\r\nthey are clean, dry, and in good order, place them on a block made for\r\nthe purpose, or on rings of rope, or in indentations in the floor of\r\nthe magazine, or on the ground with the fuze-holes up. The charge\r\nmeasured out in a powder-measure is poured in through a funnel, and any\r\nincendiary composition, such as pieces of port-fire, rock-fire, etc., is\r\ninserted. In the mean time the fuze is cut to the proper length\r\naccording to the range, by resting it in a groove made in the block, or\r\ninserting it in a hole made in a block or in a post, and sawing it\r\nacross with the fuze-saw; or the fuze may be bored through with a gimlet\r\nperpendicularly to the axis at the proper point. The fuze is then tried\r\nin the fuze-hole, and should enter three-fourths of its length. If it\r\ndoes not, it may be reduced by rasping. The head of it is covered with\r\ntow to prevent the breaking of the composition, the fuze-setter placed\r\non, and the fuze driven with the mallet until the head projects not more\r\nthan 0.2 inch to 0.4 inch above the surface of the shell. These shells\r\nare generally filled and the fuzes driven in the battery magazines, as\r\nthey are required. Shells for heavy guns are loaded in the same way as\r\nmortar-shells; but as paper fuzes inserted in wooden or bronze\r\nfuze-plugs are used instead of wooden fuzes, the plug only is driven\r\ninto its place, and stopped with tow after the bursting charge has been\r\npoured through it into the shell.\r\n\r\n=Loading-bar.= A bar used to carry shot. It is passed through the ring\r\nof the shell-hooks; also called _carrying-bar_.\r\n\r\n=Loading-tongs.= A pair of tongs used with siege howitzers to set the\r\nshell home.\r\n\r\n=Loano.= A town of Italy, in the province of Genoa, situated on the Gulf\r\nof Genoa. Here the Austrians and Sardinians were defeated by the French,\r\nunder Masséna, November 23, 1795.\r\n\r\n=Lobau.= An island of Lower Austria, in the Danube, 5 miles\r\neast-southeast of Vienna. Here the French, in 1809, remained intrenched\r\nfor six weeks, between the battles of Gross-Aspern and Wagram.\r\n\r\n=Lobbes.= A town of Belgium, 10 miles southwest from Charleroi, on the\r\nSambre. This was the scene of an engagement between the Austrian and\r\nFrench troops in 1794.\r\n\r\n=Local Rank=, or =Temporary Rank=. An officer who receives increased\r\nrank, for a limited period or during the performance of some specific\r\nduty, is said to have local rank. Also sometimes applied to the rank\r\nheld by an officer who is assigned to duty by his brevet rank to a\r\nlocality fixed by geographical limits, such as a military department or\r\ndistrict. See BREVET RANK.\r\n\r\n=Lochaber-axe.= A formidable weapon of war, consisting of a pole bearing\r\nan axe at its upper end, formerly used by the Scotch Highlanders.\r\n\r\n=Lochage.= In Greek antiquity, an officer who commanded a cohort.\r\n\r\n=Lochleven Castle.= In Scotland, built on an isle in Loch Leven, it is\r\nsaid by the Picts. It was besieged by the English in 1301 and in 1334.\r\nThe Earl of Northumberland was confined in it, 1569. It was the place of\r\nQueen Mary’s imprisonment in 1667.\r\n\r\n=Lock.= That part of a fire-arm by which fire is produced for the\r\ndischarge of a piece. The first form of the apparatus was the\r\n_match-lock_, which consisted of a lever holding a lighted match, which\r\nby a simple mechanism was brought in contact with the priming. This was\r\nsuperseded by the _wheel-lock_, invented in Nuremburg, or Italy,\r\naccording to different authorities, which made its appearance early in\r\nthe 16th century. This consisted of a wheel wound up against a spring\r\nand released by a trigger. In its revolution it evolved sparks by\r\nfriction against an alloy of iron and antimony, which fell upon and\r\nignited the priming. This was replaced about 1680 by the _flint-lock_,\r\nconsisting of a hammer, or cock, holding a flint, which in its descent\r\nstruck a steel plate. This device gave way in its turn, about 1840, to\r\nthe _percussion-lock_, which, in one or another of its many forms,\r\npromises to endure indefinitely. The terms _matchlock_, _flintlock_,\r\n_firelock_, etc., have also been used to designate the weapon itself.\r\n\r\n=Lock.= In fencing, to seize, as the sword-arm of an antagonist, by\r\nturning the left arm around it, in order to disarm him.\r\n\r\n=Lock-chain Bridles.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF, THE CAISSON.\r\n\r\n=Lock-chain Hooks.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF, THE CAISSON.\r\n\r\n=Lock-chains.= Are chains used to lock the wheels of field- and\r\nsiege-carriages, or to prevent them from turning. For siege-carriages\r\nthe chain has a shoe at the end, which goes under the wheel and lifts it\r\nfrom the ground. In field-carriages the chain is passed around one of\r\nthe felloes and secured to itself by a key. In both carriages the chain\r\nis secured to the stock by an assembling-bolt.\r\n\r\n=Lock-chains.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF, THE CAISSON.\r\n\r\n=Locket.= The chape of a sword-scabbard.\r\n\r\n=Locking-plates.= Are thin, flat pieces of iron on the sides of a\r\nfield-carriage, where the wheels touch it in turning, to prevent the\r\nwearing of the wood in those places. These plates are commonly called\r\nwheel-guard plates.\r\n\r\n=Lock-plate.= The plate in a small-arm which covers the lock and to\r\nwhich the mechanism is attached.\r\n\r\n=Lockspit.= In field fortification, a small cut or trench made with a\r\nspade, about a foot wide, to mark out the first lines of a work.\r\n\r\n=Lock-step.= A mode of marching by a body of men going one after another\r\nas closely as possible, in which the leg of each moves at the same time\r\nwith and closely follows the corresponding leg of the person directly\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n=Locri=, or =Locri Epizephyrii= (now _Motta di Burzano_). A town of the\r\nGreek Locrians in Italy, on the southeast coast of the Bruttian\r\npeninsula. An important event in its history is the battle at the river\r\nSagras, in which 10,000 Locrians and a few Rhegian auxiliaries defeated,\r\nwith great carnage, an army of 130,000 Crotoniats. They were allies of\r\nthe Romans against Pyrrhus; but after the battle of Cannæ, 210 B.C.,\r\nrevolted to the Carthaginians, and did not resume the yoke of Rome until\r\n205 B.C. From this period Locri seems to have gradually declined in\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n=Lodge Arms.= An old word of command, which was used on guards and\r\npickets for the men to place their arms in front of the guard-house or\r\nquarter-guard.\r\n\r\n=Lodge, Indian.= See WIGWAM.\r\n\r\n=Lodge-pole.= Is a pole used by Indians in the construction of their\r\nteepes. It is generally of mountain pine or ash, about 30 feet long; 2\r\nto 2¹⁄₂ inches at the butt, and 1¹⁄₂ inches at the other extremity.\r\nLodge-poles are also used by the Indians to construct their _travaux_,\r\nto convey their wounded, camp equipments, etc. See TRAVOIS.\r\n\r\n=Lodging Allowance.= In the British army, a money allowance given under\r\ncertain circumstances to officers and men for whom there is no\r\naccommodation in barracks to provide lodgings for themselves. Married\r\nsergeants and private soldiers, who are married “with permission,” are\r\nentitled to lodging-money at various rates up to 8 shillings a week,\r\nwhen separate rooms in barracks cannot be spared for the accommodation\r\nof each couple.\r\n\r\n=Lodgment.= Is a work made by the besiegers in some part of a\r\nfortification, after the besieged have been driven out, for the purpose\r\nof maintaining it, and to be covered from the enemy’s fire. It also\r\nmeans a footing obtained inside of an enemy’s works.\r\n\r\n=Lodgment.= See INJURIES TO CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Lodi.= A town of Italy, in the province of Lombardy, stands on the\r\nright bank of the Adda, 19 miles south of Milan. Lodi is celebrated for\r\nthe victory of the French under Bonaparte over the Austrians, on May 10,\r\n1796, when the long and narrow bridge was carried by the French column,\r\nnotwithstanding a tremendous fire from the Austrian batteries.\r\n\r\n=Logement= (_Fr._). Means generally any place occupied by military men,\r\nfor the time being, whether they are quartered upon the inhabitants of a\r\ntown, or are distributed in barracks. When applied to soldiers that have\r\ntaken the field, it is comprehended under the several heads of huts,\r\ntents, etc.\r\n\r\n=Logistics.= Is properly that branch of the military art embracing all\r\ndetails for moving and supplying armies. It includes the operations of\r\nthe ordnance, quartermaster’s, subsistence, medical, and pay\r\ndepartments. It also embraces the preparation and regulation of\r\nmagazines for opening a campaign, and all orders of march and other\r\norders from the general-in-chief relative to moving and supplying\r\narmies. Some writers have, however, extended its signification to\r\nembrace strategy.\r\n\r\n=Logrono.= A town of Spain, the capital of a province of the same name,\r\nin Old Castile, situated on the Ebro. In 1808 and 1823 it was occupied\r\nby the French, being of importance as a military post.\r\n\r\n=Loigny.= A village in France, department of Loiret, about 9 miles from\r\nOrleans. During the Franco-German war, the army of the Loire under Gen.\r\nChanzy was defeated near here by the Germans under the Grand Duke of\r\nMecklenburg, December 2, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Lombard.= A form or size of cannon formerly in use.\r\n\r\n=Lombards= or =Longobards=. A German people of the Suevic family, not\r\nvery numerous, but of distinguished valor, who played an important part\r\nin the early history of Europe. About the 4th century they seem to have\r\nbegun to leave their original seats (on the Lower Elbe, where the Romans\r\nseem to have come first in contact with them about the beginning of the\r\nChristian era), and to have fought their way southward and eastward,\r\ntill they came into close contact with the eastern Roman empire on the\r\nDanube, adopted an Arian form of Christianity, and after having been\r\nsome time tributary to the Heruli, raised themselves upon the ruins of\r\ntheir power, and of that of the Gepidæ, shortly after the middle of the\r\n6th century, to the position of masters of Pannonia, and became one of\r\nthe most wealthy and powerful nations in that part of the world. Under\r\ntheir king Alboin they invaded and conquered the north and centre of\r\nItaly (568-569), and founded the kingdom of Lombardy. The nobles ravaged\r\nthe greater part of Italy subsequent to 573, but in 584 they appointed\r\nAutharis their king, who greatly extended the empire, and formed a\r\npowerful kingdom. In the autumn of 773, Charlemagne invaded Italy; and\r\nin May of the following year Pavia was conquered and the Lombard\r\nkingdom, after an existence of 206 years, was overthrown. In 776, an\r\ninsurrection of some of the Lombard nobles brought Charlemagne again\r\ninto Italy, and their dukedoms were broken down into counties, and the\r\nLombard system, as far as possible, supplanted by that of the Franks. In\r\n803, a treaty between Charlemagne, the Western, and Nicephorus the\r\nEastern emperor, confirmed the right of the former to the Lombard\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n=Lombardy.= The name given to that part of Upper Italy which formed the\r\nnucleus of the kingdom of the Lombards (which see). It consisted of the\r\nwhole of Italy north of the peninsula, with the exceptions of Savoy and\r\nVenice, and after the fall of the Lombard kingdom, in 774, was\r\nincorporated in the Carlovingian empire. In 843 it was created a\r\nseparate kingdom, but was not entirely severed from the Frankish\r\nmonarchy till 888. From this time it was ruled by its own kings till\r\n961, when it was annexed to the German empire. Out of the wrecks of the\r\nold independent kingdom now arose a number of independent duchies, as\r\nFriuli, Mantua, Susa, Piedmont, etc., and soon afterwards the republics\r\nof Venice, Genoa, Milan, and Pavia, etc. The Lombard cities declared\r\nthemselves independent towards the commencement of the 12th century, and\r\nin 1167 were joined by their less powerful neighbors in the “first\r\nLombard league,” for the maintenance of their liberties against Frederic\r\nBarbarossa, whom they severely defeated in 1176. In 1225 they were\r\ncompelled to form the “second Lombard league” against Frederick II., and\r\nwith similar success. After this, petty tyrants rose in most of the\r\ncities, and foreign influence quickly followed. The Guelph and\r\nGhibelline factions greatly distracted Lombardy; and from the 15th\r\ncentury to the present time it has been contended for by the German and\r\nFrench sovereigns. The house of Austria obtained it in 1748, and held it\r\ntill 1797, when it was conquered by the French, who incorporated it into\r\nthe Cisalpine republic, and in 1805 into the kingdom of Italy. On the\r\nbreaking up of the French empire in 1815, the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom\r\nwas established by the allied sovereigns and given to Austria, who had\r\nlost her Flemish possessions. In 1859 this union was dissolved by the\r\nItalian war; and also by the treaty of Villa Franca, ceded to the king\r\nof Sardinia.\r\n\r\n=Lomond, Loch.= The largest and most celebrated of the Scottish lakes,\r\nseparating the counties of Dumbarton and Stirling. In 1263 the Norsemen,\r\nunder Angus, king of Man, after having ravaged the shores of the\r\nadjoining Loch Long, drew their boats over the neck of land which\r\nseparates the two waters at Tarbet, massacred the inhabitants, and set\r\nfire to the numerous villages they found on the shores of the lake.\r\nAfter this expedition, the loch came into the hands of some of the chief\r\nHighland clans, who long carried on their feuds here.\r\n\r\n=Lomza.= A district town in the government of Augustovo, in Poland, on\r\nthe left of the Narev, a tributary of the Vistula. It played a prominent\r\npart in the history of Poland, but has never recovered from its\r\nsufferings during the Swedish wars.\r\n\r\n=Lonato.= A town of Northern Italy, province of Brescia; it is\r\nsurrounded by walls, and further defended by a citadel. It suffered\r\ngreatly during the Middle Ages by pestilence. Here Bonaparte gained a\r\nvictory over the Austrians in 1796.\r\n\r\n=London.= The capital and chief city of the British empire, stands on\r\nboth banks of the Thames, about 60 miles from the sea. It appears first\r\nin history under the reign of Claudius, and it was fortified under\r\nConstantine the Great. Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, reduced London to\r\nashes, and put 70,000 Romans and strangers to the sword in 61; it was\r\nrebuilt and walled in by the Romans in 306; pillaged by the Danes in\r\n839. In 1875 its population was 3,445,160.\r\n\r\n=London, New.= A city of New London Co., Conn., situated 42 miles\r\nsoutheast from Hartford, on the Thames. This place was burned by the\r\nBritish in 1781.\r\n\r\n=Londonderry.= The capital of a county of the same name in Ireland, on\r\nthe Foyle. This town is of great antiquity, and has often suffered from\r\nthe effects of war. It was besieged by James II., from December, 1688,\r\ntill August, 1689, when the siege was raised.\r\n\r\n=Long Island.= An island about 115 miles long, which is separated from\r\nNew York by the East River, a strait about half a mile wide. Its capital\r\nis Brooklyn (which see), where was fought in 1776 the first pitched\r\nbattle of the Revolutionary war, the result being the defeat of the\r\nAmericans. The island suffered considerably at the hands of the English\r\nduring this war. During the civil war (1861-65) Long Island took an\r\nactive part in aid of the cause of the Union.\r\n\r\n=Long Roll.= See ROLL, LONG.\r\n\r\n=Long-bow.= A bow of the height of the archer, formerly used in England\r\nfor war and sport.\r\n\r\n=Long-jawed.= The state of a rope when its strands are straightened by\r\nbeing much strained and untwisted, and from its pliability will coil\r\nboth ways.\r\n\r\n=Longitudinal Strain.= The strain on a cannon or fire-arm which tends to\r\npart it with a ring fracture. See ORDNANCE, STRAINS UPON.\r\n\r\n=Longwy.= A strongly fortified town of France, in the department of the\r\nMoselle, 33 miles northwest from Metz. This is called the “iron gate of\r\nFrance,” and was in 1792 taken by the Prussians, and again by the allies\r\nin 1815.\r\n\r\n=Looking-glass Signaling.= A method of signaling invented and\r\nextensively used by the North American Indians, both on the Plains and\r\nin the regions west of the Rocky Mountains. The reflection of the sun is\r\nflashed from a small piece of a mirror held in the hand. Indians have\r\nbeen known to communicate over a distance of several miles by this\r\nmeans. It is also extensively used in their drills,--the chief often\r\ndirecting the movements of his warriors with the greatest ease and\r\ncertainty from a distant point overlooking the field. This method of\r\nsignaling, modified by the resources of science, has been lately\r\nintroduced into the English service, and used both in India and Southern\r\nAfrica. A concave mirror is used, and an artificial light replaces the\r\nsun when he is absent. The method has been called heliography.\r\n\r\n=Loop-holed Galleries.= Are vaulted passages or casemates, usually\r\nplaced behind the counterscarp revetment, and behind the gorges of\r\ndetached works, having holes pierced through the walls, to enable the\r\ndefenders to bring a musketry fire from unseen positions upon the\r\nassailants in the ditch. Loop-holes, however, are not confined to\r\ngalleries. In modern fortifications, the revetments, both scarp and\r\ncounterscarp, are very generally pierced for musketry fire.\r\n\r\n=Loop-holes.= Apertures in a wall or stockade, through which a fire of\r\nmusketry may be directed on the exterior ground.\r\n\r\n=Loose.= Not close or compact. “With horse and chariots ranked in loose\r\narray.”\r\n\r\n=Loosen, To.= To open ranks or files from close order. To loosen is, in\r\nfact, to lose that firm continuity of line or perpendicular adherence,\r\nwhich constitutes the true basis of military operations. The lock-step\r\nwas introduced for the purpose of counteracting the mischievous effects\r\nof loose marching, but it produced a greater inconvenience, and has\r\ntherefore been laid aside; the equal pace and marked time correct both.\r\n\r\n=Loot.= An East Indian term for plunder or pillage.\r\n\r\n=Looties=, or =Lootees=. An East Indian term for a body of irregular\r\nhorsemen, who plunder and lay waste the country, and harass the enemy in\r\ntheir march.\r\n\r\n=Lootywallow.= An East Indian term of the same import as _looties_.\r\n\r\n=Lorarii.= Among the Romans, officers whose business it was, with whips\r\nand scourges, to compel the gladiators to engage. The lorarii also\r\npunished slaves who disobeyed their masters.\r\n\r\n=Lorca.= A town of Spain, in the province of Murcia, on the Cornera.\r\nThis town is remarkable in history as having been the key of Murcia\r\nduring the Moorish wars; being situated on the frontiers of Granada, it\r\nwas often taken and retaken. It suffered greatly from military violence\r\nduring the French occupation in 1810.\r\n\r\n=Lord-Lieutenant.= In Great Britain the lord-lieutenant of a county is a\r\npermanent provincial governor appointed by the sovereign by patent under\r\nthe great seal. He is the permanent local representative of the crown,\r\nwho, on the occasion of an invasion or rebellion, has power to raise the\r\nmilitia, form regiments, troops, and companies, and give commissions to\r\nofficers. He is also the head of the magistracy, the militia, and the\r\nyeomanry; he nominates officers of militia and volunteers, and is the\r\nchief executive authority.\r\n\r\n=Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.= The viceroy or deputy of the sovereign, to\r\nwhom the government of Ireland is committed. The office has existed from\r\na remote period, the appointment having been made under different\r\ndesignations. The lord-lieutenant is appointed under the great seal of\r\nthe United Kingdom, and bears the sword of state as the symbol of his\r\nviceregal office. He has the control of the police, and may issue orders\r\nto the general commanding the troops for the support of the civil\r\nauthority, the protection of the public, the defense of the kingdom, and\r\nthe suppression of insurrection. He also has the power to confer\r\nknighthood.\r\n\r\n=Loreto=, or =Loretto=. A fortified city of Italy, in the province of\r\nMacerate, situated 14 miles southeast from Ancona. This place was taken\r\nby the French in 1797.\r\n\r\n=Lorica.= A cuirass, or coat of mail worn by the Roman soldiers, was\r\nmade of various materials. The ordinary kind consisted of a skin, or a\r\npiece of strong linen covered with small plates of iron, which resembled\r\nboth in their shape and in their manner of overlapping each other the\r\nscales of a serpent or fish. Sometimes cuirasses or hauberks, composed\r\nentirely of iron rings linked together, were worn by the Roman\r\n_hastati_. A less flexible but more impervious defense was the cuirass\r\nmade of hard leather or of metal, and consisting of two parts (the one\r\ncovering the breast and abdomen, and the other the back), united by\r\nhinges and leathern thongs.\r\n\r\n=Lorraine= (Ger. _Lothringen_). A former extensive province of France,\r\nincluded in the departments of Vosges, Meurthe, Moselle, and Meuse.\r\nUnder the Romans it formed part of the Belgic division of Gaul, and was\r\nafterwards united to the empire of Charlemagne. It subsequently became a\r\nduchy, and passed into possession of the dukes of the house of Austria.\r\nIn 1836 it was ceded to Stanislas, ex-king of Poland, and after his\r\ndeath passed to the crown of France, from which it was wrested by the\r\nGermans at the close of the Franco-German war, May 10, 1871.\r\n\r\n=Los Angeles.= A city, the capital of a county of the same name, in\r\nSouthern California, about 350 miles southeast of San Francisco. It was\r\ncaptured from the Mexicans by the combined forces of Gen.

The principle of settling all such claims by special\r\nlegislation cannot but bear hardly on a number of individuals, and also\r\nprobably in the end imposes greater burdens upon the treasury.\r\n\r\n=Loudon.= A parish of Ayrshire, Scotland, 4 miles east from Kilmarnock.\r\nIn the neighborhood, at Loudon Hall, Bruce, with his forces, encountered\r\nthe troops of the Earl of Pembroke in 1307.\r\n\r\n=Loudon-hill.= See DRUMCLOG.\r\n\r\n=Louis=, or =Knights of St. Louis=.

The king was always grand master.\r\n\r\n=Louisburg.= A famous fortress built by the French soon after the peace\r\nof Utrecht (1713) upon the eastern coast of Cape Breton Island. Since\r\nthe existence of so strong a place threatened the colonial and English\r\nfisheries, it was determined in 1745 by the Legislature of Massachusetts\r\nBay (France and Great Britain being then at war) to strike a blow at the\r\ntown. Accordingly, a force of colonists consisting of 3250 Massachusetts\r\nmilitia, aided by 516 men from Connecticut and 304 from New Hampshire,\r\nset sail in 100 vessels, and landed near the town, April 30, 1745. An\r\nactive but irregular siege (though the men were without tents and the\r\nproper means of conducting such operations) was terminated June 17,\r\n1745, by the capitulation of the French under Duchambon. But the peace\r\nof Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) gave back all Cape Breton to France. The town\r\nwas invested in 1758 by Gen. Amherst with 14,000 British troops, 20 line\r\nships, 18 frigates and other vessels. After a tremendous bombardment,\r\nwhich quite destroyed the town, and breached the walls badly, the\r\ngarrison and French fleet surrendered July 26, 1758. The English\r\noverthrew the fortifications at an expense of $50,000. The first cost\r\nwas one hundred times that sum.\r\n\r\n=Louisiana.= One of the Southern or Gulf States of the United States,\r\nlying between Arkansas and Mississippi on the north and east, the Gulf\r\nof Mexico on the south, and Texas on the west. The country was visited\r\nby La Salle, and the mouth of the Mississippi discovered in 1691, and\r\nthough Iberville attempted to found a colony in 1699, his efforts were\r\nnot successful. The country was transferred to Spain by France in 1762;\r\nrestored to France in 1800; and purchased by the United States in 1803.\r\nThat part of the Territory now known as the State of that name was\r\nadmitted into the Union in 1812, and was within three years afterwards\r\nthe scene of the great battle of New Orleans, fought January 8, 1815,\r\nbetween the British troops under Gen. Pakenham, and the Americans under\r\nGen. Jackson, in which the former were defeated with great loss. The\r\nState seceded, and was the theatre of many important events during the\r\ncivil war (1861-65).\r\n\r\n=Loup des Anciens= (_Fr._).

It was sacked both by Edward III. and Henry V. of England.\r\n\r\n=Lover’s War.= In French history, a name given to a civil war in the\r\nyear 1580, during the reign of Henry IV. It was so called because it\r\narose from the jealousies and rivalries of the leaders, who were invited\r\nto meet at the palace of the queen-mother.\r\n\r\n=Loyalist.= A person who adheres to his sovereign, or to the constituted\r\nauthority; especially one who maintains his allegiance to his prince or\r\ngovernment, and defends his cause in times of revolt.\r\n\r\n=Lozenge.= In heraldry, a charge generally enumerated among the\r\nsub-ordinaries, in the shape of a rhombus placed with the acute angles\r\nat top and bottom. The horizontal diameter must be at least equal to the\r\nsides, otherwise it is not a lozenge, but a _fusil_. The term _lozengy_\r\nis applied to a field divided by diagonal lines crossing one another at\r\nregular intervals, so as to form a diamond pattern, the compartments\r\nbeing of alternate tinctures.\r\n\r\n=Lubeck.= One of the three cities of the German empire, situated on the\r\nriver Trave, about 14 miles from the Baltic. Lubeck has existed since\r\nthe 11th century, and received important privileges from the German\r\nemperors in the 12th century, which were confirmed by the Danes, into\r\nwhose power it fell in 1201. It was declared a free city of the empire\r\nin 1226, and thereafter maintained its independence against the Danes,\r\nand joined the other towns in the great Hanseatic League (which see).\r\nWith the decline of the Hanseatic League, it lost its historic\r\nimportance, but continued to flourish as an independent city, till it\r\nwas taken and plundered by the French, November 6, 1806. In 1810 it was\r\nincorporated with the French empire, and in 1813 the Russians compelled\r\nthe French to deliver it to its rightful owners; but the French again\r\noccupied it, until it was liberated by Sweden. In 1871 it was annexed to\r\nthe German empire.\r\n\r\n=Lubny=, or =Lubnu=. A town of European Russia, government of Poltava,\r\nor Pultowa, on the Sulla.

Sometimes called Nuceria, a town in Apulia, on\r\nthe borders of Samnium. In the war between Rome and Samnium, it was\r\ntaken by the Samnites, 321 B.C., and next by the Romans, 319; but having\r\nrevolted to the Samnites in 314, all the inhabitants were massacred by\r\nthe Romans, and their place supplied by Roman colonists.\r\n\r\n=Lucknow= (Hind. _Laksmanavate_). A city of British India, capital of\r\nOude, situated on the right bank of the Goomty, 610 miles from Calcutta.\r\nIn 1857, during the Indian mutiny, this place was besieged by the\r\nrebels, but was bravely defended by the troops under Sir Henry Lawrence,\r\nand afterwards by Gens. Outram and Havelock. The long-suffering troops\r\nand English residents were finally relieved by Sir Colin Campbell, who\r\nthen effected one of the most masterly retreats on record in the annals\r\nof Indian warfare. The British regained possession of it in 1858.\r\n\r\n=Lucon.= A town of France, in the department of Vendée, situated on the\r\nedge of a marshy plain. The Republicans sustained a defeat under the\r\nwalls of Lucon in 1703, and the insurgent Vendeans besieged the place\r\nsome months afterwards, but without success.\r\n\r\n=Ludlow.= A municipal and Parliamentary borough of England, in the\r\ncounty of Salop, at the confluence of the Corve and Teme. The castle,\r\nnow a magnificent ruin, was at one time one of the most important\r\nstrongholds against the Welsh.\r\n\r\n=Lugo.= A town of Italy, in the province of Ravenna.

In this contest the American\r\ntroops, numbering about 4500, commanded by Gen. Brown, succeeded, after\r\na display of desperate valor and perseverance, in repulsing about\r\nmidnight a body of 7000 British, and capturing one of their generals,\r\nRiall, and 7 pieces of cannon. The losses on both sides were nearly\r\nequal (about 850 killed, wounded, and missing). During the night the\r\nAmericans fell back to Chippewa, being unable to convey their trophies\r\nwith them for want of means of transportation, and in the morning when\r\nthey advanced to Bridgewater Mills they found the enemy again occupying\r\nthe battle-ground, in possession of their captured cannon, and having\r\nbeen reinforced too strong to be again dislodged. The Americans thus\r\nlost all the substantial fruits of the victory.\r\n\r\n=Lunge= (a corruption of _allonge_). A pass or thrust with a sword; a\r\nshove with a boarding-pike.\r\n\r\n=Lunette.= A field-work consisting of two faces forming a salient angle,\r\nor one projecting towards the enemy, and two flanks parallel, or nearly\r\nso, to the capital or imaginary line bisecting the salient angle.

Sacrifices or ceremonies by which the\r\nancients purified their cities, fields, armies, or people, defiled by\r\nany crime or impurity. There were several ways of performing lustration,\r\nviz., by fire, by sulphur, by water, and by air. The Roman people\r\nunderwent a lustration in the Campus Martius, after the census, which\r\nwas taken every five years (_lustrum_), had been completed. In the\r\narmies, some chosen soldiers, crowned with laurel, led the victims--a\r\ncow, a sheep, and a bull--thrice round the army ranged in battle-array\r\nin the field of Mars, to which deity the victims were subsequently\r\nsacrificed, after many imprecations had been invoked upon the enemies of\r\nthe Romans. The Gothic kings abolished these ceremonies when they became\r\nmasters of Rome.\r\n\r\n=Lutter.= A town of Germany, 23 miles southwest from Brunswick, in the\r\nHartz district. Christian IV., king of Denmark, was defeated near this\r\ntown by Tilly in 1626.\r\n\r\n=Lutzen.= A small town of Prussia, province of Saxony, famous for two\r\ngreat battles fought in its vicinity. The first took place on November\r\n16, 1632, between the Swedish army under Gustavus Adolphus and the\r\nImperialists under Wallenstein; Gustavus Adolphus was killed, but the\r\nvictory was gained by the Swedes. The second great battle was fought on\r\nMay 2, 1813, somewhat farther to the south, at the village of\r\nGroszgörschen. It was the first great conflict of the united Russian and\r\nPrussian armies with the army of Napoleon in that decisive campaign. The\r\nallies gained at first great successes; but the French were left in\r\npossession of the field at the close of the day.\r\n\r\n=Luxemburg.= The capital of the grand duchy of Luxemburg, situated on\r\nthe Else, or Alzette. The Spaniards, Austrians, French, and Dutch, who\r\nsuccessively held possession of the town, so increased and strengthened\r\nits fortifications that in the beginning of the 19th century it was\r\nconsidered to be, with the exception of Gibraltar, the strongest\r\nfortress in Europe.

The Scottish king-at-arms has, unlike his brother-kings of\r\nEngland, from an early period exercised jurisdiction independently of\r\nthe constable and marshal, holding office directly from the sovereign by\r\ncommission under the Great Seal. In early times he was occasionally\r\ndesignated the _Lord_ Lyon; but the now prevalent custom of so calling\r\nhim seems to have arisen from the circumstance that, since 1796, the\r\noffice has been held by a peer. According to Nesbet, the Lyon has\r\nprecedence of all knights and gentlemen not being officers of state, or\r\nsenators of the College of Justice. Since the Union, he has ranked next\r\nto Garter; Clarencieux and Norroy follow; then Ulster; but it has\r\nsometimes been maintained that within Ireland, Ulster has place next\r\nafter Lyon. The Lyon is king-at-arms to the order of the Thistle.\r\n\r\n=Lyons=, or =Lyon= (anc. _Lugdunum_). A city of France, capital of the\r\ndepartment of the Rhône, situated at the confluence of the Rhône and\r\nSaône.

It was plundered and\r\nagain burnt by the soldiers of Septimius Severus, after the defeat of\r\nAlbinus near it in 197 A.D. In 1793, the city having refused to submit\r\nto the Convention, sustained a memorable siege from August 8 to October\r\n9, on which date it was taken, and suffered severely at the hands of the\r\nrepublicans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=McAllister, Fort.= A formidable casemated earthwork, with bombproofs,\r\nmounting 9 guns, on Genesis Point, about 6 miles above the mouth of\r\nGreat Ogeechee River, Georgia, which was erected by the Confederates\r\nduring the civil war. On January 27, 1863, it was attacked by the\r\nironclad “Montauk,” under the command of Capt. John L. Worden, three\r\ngunboats, and a mortar-schooner; but after a bombardment of many hours’\r\nduration, they failed to reduce it. Another attack was made with like\r\nresults on February 1, the “Montauk” again participating in it. A third\r\nattack was made on March 3, and after a bombardment of eight hours by a\r\nfleet of ironclad monitors and mortar-schooners, under the command of\r\nCapt. Drayton, they again failed to reduce it. After the naval attacks\r\nthe fort received additions in armament and garrison, and in 1864\r\ncomprised three half-bastions and two curtains, mounted 21 guns, several\r\nof which were 8-inch and 10-inch pieces, and was garrisoned by 250 men.\r\nOn December 13, 1864, it was taken by assault by a division of Gen.\r\nSherman’s army under Gen. Hazen, and its entire garrison and stores\r\ncaptured. Communication by water being thus opened, the capture of\r\nSavannah followed on December 21.\r\n\r\n=Macadamized.= A term applied to roads covered with broken stone,--from\r\nMcAdam, a Scotch engineer, who first introduced this method of\r\nroad-making.\r\n\r\n=Macana.= The war-club of the South American Indians.\r\n\r\n=Macassar=, or =Mankasser=. The chief settlement of the Dutch in the\r\nisland of Celebes, and is defended by Fort Rotterdam. In 1810 it\r\nsurrendered to the British, but was restored to the Dutch in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Maccabees.= A family of patriotic Jews, who commenced their career\r\nduring the persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes, 167 B.C., when\r\nMattathias, a priest, resisted the tyranny of the governor. His son,\r\nJudas Maccabæus, defeated the Syrians in three battles, 166 and 165\r\nB.C., but fell in an ambush, 161 B.C. His brother Jonathan made a league\r\nwith the Romans and Lacedæmonians, and after an able administration was\r\ntreacherously killed at Ptolemais by Tryphon, 143 B.C. His brother and\r\nsuccessor, Simon, was also murdered. The history of the Maccabees is\r\ncontained in five books bearing that name.\r\n\r\n=Mace.= A strong, short, wooden staff, with a spiked metal ball for a\r\nhead. It was a favorite weapon with knights, with the cavalry\r\nimmediately succeeding them, and at all times with fighting priests,\r\nwhom a canon of the church forbade to wield the sword. No armor could\r\nresist the force of a well-delivered blow from the mace. The mace is now\r\nborne before magistrates as an ensign of authority.\r\n\r\n=Macedonia.= Anciently the name of a country lying north of Thessaly,\r\nwhich was originally of small extent. The history of Macedonia is\r\ninvolved in much obscurity till about 490 B.C., when the Persians\r\nsubdued it, so that the Macedonian king, Alexander I., was compelled to\r\ntake part with Xerxes in his invasion of Greece. It again regained its\r\nindependence upon the retreat of the Persians after the battle of Platæa\r\nin 479 B.C. After a period of civil wars Philip II. ascended the throne\r\nin 359 B.C., and his son Alexander III., surnamed Alexander the Great,\r\nbrought half the then known world under his empire; but after his death\r\nthe Macedonian empire was broken up, and, at the end of a period of\r\ntwenty-two years of incessant wars, formed into four principal kingdoms\r\nunder his greatest generals. Macedonia itself fell to the lot of\r\nAntipater, after whose death ensued another period of civil wars and\r\ncontests for the throne. The Macedonians were defeated by the Romans in\r\nthe great battle of Cynocephalæ, 197 B.C., and their country became\r\nsubject to the Roman power. After the time of Constantine the country\r\nwas ravaged by Slavic tribes, and by the 7th century the old semi-Greek\r\nMacedonians were extinct, and in the latter ages of the Byzantine empire\r\ntheir place was supplied by colonies from Asia, many of them of Turkish\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\n=Macedonian Pike=, or =Sarissa=.

The apertures are for the purpose of allowing projectiles to\r\nbe hurled at an enemy when he approaches near the wall, as in scaling,\r\nundermining, etc. Such defenses are very common in castellated\r\narchitecture, especially over gateways, towers, etc.\r\n\r\n=Machicoulis.= The same as machicolation.\r\n\r\n=Machine Guns.= See BATTERY GUNS.\r\n\r\n=Machine, Infernal.= This term has been applied to various deadly\r\ncontrivances, for instance, to the battery gun with which the attempt to\r\nassassinate Louis Philippe was made, as well as to the devices used on\r\nsimilar historical occasions; also to the fire-ship used by the English\r\nat St. Malo. This was a three-decker charged with powder on the first\r\ndeck; shells, carcasses, etc., on the second; and with barrels filled\r\nwith combustibles on the third; the gun-deck was covered with old guns\r\noverloaded.

It is now considered one of the\r\nstrongest fortresses in India.\r\n\r\n=Madrid.= The capital of Spain, in New Castile, on the left bank of the\r\nriver Manzanares. It is mentioned in history as _Majerit_, a Moorish\r\ncastle. Madrid was sacked by the Moors in 1109; retaken and fortified by\r\nHenry III. about 1400; taken by Lord Galway in 1706; and by the French\r\nin March, 1808. The citizens of Madrid attempted to expel the French,\r\nand were defeated with much slaughter, May 2, 1808; the French were\r\ncompelled to retire, but the place was retaken by them December 2, 1808,\r\nand retained until Wellington and his army entered it, August 12, 1812.\r\n\r\n=Madriers.= Are long planks of broad wood, used for supporting the earth\r\nin mining, carrying on a sap, making coffers, caponiers, galleries, and\r\nfor various other purposes at a siege; also to cover the mouth of\r\npetards after they are loaded, and are fixed with the petards to the\r\ngates or other places designed to be forced open. When the planks are\r\nnot strong enough they are doubled with plates of iron.\r\n\r\n=Madura.= An island of the Malay Archipelago, situated off the northeast\r\ncoast of the island of Java, from which it is separated by a narrow\r\nchannel. The Dutch invaded this island about the year 1747, and made\r\nslaves of a great number of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n=Maestricht.= A town of Holland, and capital of the province of Limburg,\r\non the Maas, 110 miles southeast from Amsterdam. This town was taken by\r\nthe French in 1794; and from 1795 till 1814 it was the capital of the\r\nFrench department of the Lower Meuse.\r\n\r\n=Magazine.= A word derived from the Arabic, _makhzan_, “store-house,”\r\nmeans any place where stores are kept; but as a military expression, it\r\nalways means a store-house for powder, although arms may at times be\r\nkept in it. In military structures the magazines must be bomb-proof, and\r\ntherefore necessitate very thick walls; they must be quite free from\r\ndamp, and should admit sufficient daylight to render the use of lanterns\r\nwithin generally unnecessary. The entrance is protected by shot-proof\r\ntraverses, lest an opening should be forced by ricochet shots.\r\n\r\n=Magazine Guns.= Are breech-loading small-arms having a magazine\r\ncapable of holding several cartridges which may be fired in quick\r\nsuccession,--the empty shell being ejected and another cartridge\r\nconveyed into the breech from the magazine by working the mechanism of\r\nthe piece. Among American magazine guns, the _Spencer_ was one of the\r\nfirst that proved successful, and was extensively used during the war of\r\nthe Rebellion, 1861-65. The magazine was a tube in the stock. The\r\n_Spencer_ is no longer made. The _Henry_ was a contemporary, and used a\r\ntube under the barrel,--this gun as now improved is known as the\r\n_Winchester_, and is sold in every part of the globe. The _Ward-Burton_\r\nand _Hotchkiss_ have tubes, the first under the barrel, the second in\r\nthe stock like the _Spencer_; they are both _bolt_ guns _as to_ breech\r\nmechanism. The _Lee_ uses as a magazine a kind of pocket between the\r\nstock and barrel. This is readily detached. A gun carrying a\r\ngreat number of cartridges is the _Evans_, which has a spiral\r\ncartridge-carrier in the stock. Other guns, the _Meigs_ and _Cullen_,\r\nhave been made carrying a still greater number, as many as forty or\r\nfifty, but these systems have not met with any considerable success. See\r\nSMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Magdala.= A strong mountain fortress in Abyssinia, which King Theodore\r\nheld against the expedition sent out in 1867 by the British government\r\nfor the rescue of their subjects.

See\r\nABYSSINIA.\r\n\r\n=Magdeburg.= A fortified city of Prussia, in the province of Saxony, on\r\nthe Elbe. It was founded by Otto the Great in the 10th century, and is\r\nconsidered one of the strongest fortresses in Germany. It suffered\r\ngreatly during the Thirty Years’ War, when it was sacked, and its\r\ninhabitants massacred, under the direction of Tilly. In 1806 it was\r\ntaken by the French, and annexed by them to the kingdom of Westphalia;\r\nbut finally restored to Prussia in consequence of the downfall of\r\nNapoleon in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Magdolum= (in the Old Testament _Migdol_).

A\r\ngreat battle was fought here in June, 1859, between the French and\r\nAustrians, in which the latter were defeated. The French were commanded\r\nby Gen. MacMahon, who received the title of Duke of Magenta.\r\n\r\n=Magetobria= (now _Moigte de Broie_, on the Saône). A town on the\r\nwestern frontiers of the Sequani, near which the Gauls were defeated by\r\nthe Germans shortly before Cæsar’s arrival in Gaul.\r\n\r\n=Magistral Line.= The tracing or guiding line in fortification,--the\r\nfirst laid down on the work or on paper,--and from which the position of\r\nall the other works is determined. In field fortification the crest\r\nline of the parapet is the _magistral_; in permanent fortification the\r\n_cordon_ or coping of the escarp wall is the guide.\r\n\r\n=Magna Charta.= The great charter, so called, obtained by the English\r\nbarons from King John in 1215, at Runny Meade. This name is also given\r\nto the charter which was granted to the people of England in the ninth\r\nyear of Henry III., and confirmed by Edward I.\r\n\r\n=Magnate.= A person of rank or dignity; a grandee or nobleman; one of\r\ninfluence or distinction in any sphere.\r\n\r\n=Magnesia= (now _Manissa_). A town of Lydia, usually mentioned with the\r\naddition of _ad Sypilum_ (“at or near Sypilus”) to distinguish it from\r\nMagnesia on the Mæander, in Ionia, situated on the northwestern slope of\r\nMount Sypilus. It is chiefly celebrated in history for the victory\r\ngained under its walls in 190 B.C. by the two Scipios over Antiochus the\r\nGreat, whereby that monarch was forever driven from Western Asia. The\r\ntown after the victory of the Scipios surrendered to the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Magnetic.= Pertaining to the magnet; possessing the properties of the\r\nmagnet, or corresponding properties; as, a magnetic needle. _Magnetic\r\nneedle_, a slender bar of steel magnetized and suspended at its centre\r\non a sharp-pointed pivot, so that it may take freely the direction of\r\nthe magnetic meridian.

This place was the key\r\nof the position of the Mahratta army on December 29, 1843, when the\r\nbattle took place between them and the British army under Sir Hugh\r\nGough. The Mahrattas were totally defeated.\r\n\r\n=Mahe.= A seaport in Hindostan, India; is a French settlement on the\r\ncoast of Malabar, and was taken possession of by them in 1722; retaken\r\nby the British in 1761; restored at the peace of Paris in 1763, but was\r\nagain taken in 1793. It was restored to the French in 1815.\r\n\r\n=Mahrattas.= A people of Hindoo (Hindu) race, inhabiting Central India,\r\nsouth of the Ganges, from Gwalior to Goa, and supposed by many to be the\r\ndescendants of a Persian or North Indian people. They are first\r\nmentioned in history about the middle of the 17th century. Under the\r\nleadership of Sevaji, a freebooter or adventurer, they overran and\r\nsubdued a large portion of the emperor of Delhi’s territory. They\r\nsubsequently were divided into tribes under powerful leaders, and\r\nendeavored to overcome the Mogul; but they sustained a frightful defeat\r\nin January, 1761, at the hands of Ahmed Shah Abdalli, the ruler of\r\nAfghanistan, on the field of Paniput, where they lost 50,000 men, and\r\nall their chiefs except Holkar. They still, however, continued to be the\r\nhired mercenaries of the Delhi emperor, till the growing influence of\r\nthe British compelled them to look to their own safety. After many long\r\nand bloody contests with the British and their allies, in which\r\nsometimes the whole, but more frequently a portion of the Mahrattas\r\njoined, they were one by one, with the exception of Scindiah, reduced to\r\na state of dependence. This last-mentioned chief having raised a\r\npowerful army, officered by Frenchmen and disciplined after the European\r\nmethod, continued the contest for a number of years, till his power was\r\nfinally broken in 1843. The Mahratta chiefs still possess extensive\r\ndominions under British protection.\r\n\r\n=Maida.= A town of Naples, in Calabria Ulta, 9 miles south from\r\nNicastra.

In 1648 this town was stormed by the Parliamentary\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n=Mail= (Fr. _maille_, It. _maglia_; from the Lat. _macula_, a “spot,\r\nhole, or mesh of a net”). Signifies a metal net-work, and is ordinarily\r\napplied to such net-work when used as body defensive armor. Well-made\r\nmail formed an admirable defense against all weapons except fire-arms,\r\nand its pliability and comparative lightness gave it favor over the more\r\ncumbrous plate-armor.\r\n\r\n=Mail.= To put a coat of mail or armor upon; to arm defensively.\r\n\r\n=Maillet= (_Fr._). A mallet. The French formerly made use of this\r\ninstrument as an offensive weapon in their engagements. In 1351 the\r\nmallet was used at the famous battle “des Trente” (of thirty), which\r\nderived its name from the number of combatants that fought on each side.\r\nThis extraordinary combat holds a distinguished place in the history of\r\nBrittany, and was entered into by the partisans of Charles of Blois and\r\nthe king of France on one side, and by the Count Montfort and the king\r\nof England on the other. Under the reign of Charles VI. a Parisian mob\r\nforced the arsenal, and took out a large quantity of mallets, with which\r\nthey armed themselves for the purpose of murdering the custom-house\r\nofficers. The persons who assembled on this occasion were afterwards\r\ncalled _Maillotins_. In the days of Louis XII. the English archers\r\ncarried mallets as offensive weapons.\r\n\r\n=Maillotin= (_Fr._). An old French term which signified an ancient\r\nweapon that was used to attack men who wore helmets and cuirasses. A\r\nfaction in France was also distinguished by this appellation.

The first settlement was made in it at Phippsburg, in\r\n1607, but was subsequently abandoned. Settlements from New Hampshire\r\ngradually extended themselves into it, and it was afterwards annexed to\r\nMassachusetts, as far as the Kennebec River. In the latter part of the\r\n17th century it suffered much from the incursions of the savages and the\r\nFrench, many of the towns being laid waste and the inhabitants\r\nslaughtered. This state of affairs was terminated by the treaty of\r\nUtrecht in 1712. During the Revolutionary war Portland was bombarded by\r\nthe British in 1775, and much property destroyed. Maine was admitted\r\ninto the Union as a State in 1820. Its northern boundary formed a\r\nsubject of controversy with Great Britain, which threatened a war, but\r\nwas settled by compromise in 1842. During the civil war, Maine was one\r\nof the most active of the Northern States in the cause of the Union.\r\n\r\n=Mainotes.= The inhabitants of the mountainous district of Maina, a\r\npeninsula between the bays of the Kolokythia and Koron, forming part of\r\nthe province of Laconia, in Greece. They number about 60,000, and are a\r\nwild and brave race, but addicted to robbery. While the Turks held\r\npossession of Greece, the Mainotes were almost completely independent,\r\nand when not engaged in a common struggle against the Turks their chiefs\r\nwere at war with each other. The Mainotes, under their principal chief\r\nor bey, took a prominent part in the war for the liberation of Greece;\r\nbut subsequently their independence was destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Maintain.= When any body of men defend a place or post against the\r\nattacks of an adverse party, they are said to maintain it.\r\n\r\n=Maintenance, Cap of.= Sometimes called Cap of Dignity, a cap of crimson\r\nvelvet lined with ermine, with two points turned to the back, originally\r\nonly worn by dukes, but afterwards assigned to various families of\r\ndistinction. According to Sir John Fearne, “the wearing of the cap had a\r\nbeginning from the duke or general of an army, who, having gotten\r\nvictory, caused the chiefest of the subdued enemies whom he led to\r\nfollow him in his triumph, bearing his hat or cap after him, in token of\r\nsubjection and captivity.” Most of the reigning dukes of Germany, and\r\nvarious families belonging to the peerage both of England and Scotland,\r\nbear their crests on a cap of maintenance.\r\n\r\n=Maison-du-Roi= (_Fr._). The king’s household.

On the downfall of Tippoo Sahib,\r\nthis country was annexed to the British dominions.\r\n\r\n=Malabar Guns.= Heavy pieces of ordnance, which were made in the Malabar\r\ncountry, and were formed by means of iron bars joined together with\r\nhoops. They were very long, and extremely unwieldy.\r\n\r\n=Malacca.= A British settlement situated on the west coast of the Malay\r\nPeninsula, about 100 miles northwest from the settlement of Singapore.\r\nThis district was annexed to the Portuguese dominions about 1511, taken\r\nby the Dutch in 1640, and given by the Dutch to the English in 1825.\r\n\r\n=Malacca.= The capital of the above country, is situated on the coast,\r\nupon the strait which bears its name. In 1507 this town was visited by\r\nthe Portuguese, and afterwards stormed by them. It was subsequently\r\ntaken by the Dutch, who retained possession of it till 1795, when it was\r\noccupied by a British force.\r\n\r\n=Malaga.= A city of Spain, in Granada, on the coast of the\r\nMediterranean, 66 miles northeast from Gibraltar. It fell into the hands\r\nof the Moors in 714, and was not wrested from them until 1487, when it\r\nwas taken by Ferdinand the Catholic.

The\r\nallied French and English attacked it on June 17-18, 1855, and after a\r\nconflict of forty-eight hours were repulsed with severe loss. On\r\nSeptember 8, the French again attacked the Malakoff; at 8 o’clock the\r\nfirst mine was sprung, and at noon the French flag floated over the\r\nconquered redoubt. In the Malakoff and Redan were found 3000 pieces of\r\ncannon of every caliber, and 120,000 pounds of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n=Malandrins=, or =Tard-venus= (_Fr._).

Malatesta II. and Galeotto Malatesta, sons of Pandolfo I., began\r\nto reign over Rimini in 1355. They had a great military reputation, and\r\nnext to the Visconti were perhaps the most powerful princes of Italy.\r\nThe former died in 1364, and Galeotto in 1385, leaving two sons, Carlo\r\nand Pandolfo III. These two became able generals, and commanded the army\r\nof Visconti, duke of Milan, from 1393 to 1408. Carlo, who was lord of\r\nRimini, died without issue in 1429.

It is strongly fortified around the capital,\r\nValetta, which was built by the Knights of St. John. Malta was colonized\r\nby the Carthaginians about 500 B.C., and as early as the first Punic war\r\nit was plundered by the Romans, but did not come finally into their\r\npossession until 242 B.C. During the 5th century it fell successively\r\nunder the sway of the Vandals and Goths. The Romans, however, regained\r\nit under Belisarius in 533 A.D., and kept possession of it till it was\r\nconquered by the Arabs in 870. In 1090, Count Roger of Sicily drove out\r\nthe Arabs, and established a popular council for the government of the\r\nisland. Charles of Anjou, after overrunning Sicily, made himself master\r\nof it; but after a time, the houses of Aragon and Castile successively\r\nheld the island. Subsequently, the emperor Charles V. took possession of\r\nMalta, and in 1530 granted it to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem,\r\nfrom whom the Turks had recently captured their great stronghold at\r\nRhodes. The knights raised by degrees the stupendous fortifications,\r\nand, moreover, spent their large income in beautifying the island in\r\nevery way. Meanwhile they rendered incessant services to Christendom in\r\nthe chastisement of the ferocious Barbary pirates. To revenge these\r\nacts, the Turks brought immense forces against Malta in 1557, and again\r\nin 1565. The siege in the latter year was carried on by the sultan\r\nSolyman himself, with the flower of the Ottoman army; but the grand\r\nmaster, La Valette, opposed a heroic resistance, and he was forced to\r\nre-embark, with the loss of more than 25,000 of his best troops. The\r\ndefenders lost 260 knights and 7000 Maltese soldiers; and their\r\ngallantry was the theme of admiration throughout the world. After this\r\nsiege the knights built Valetta. In 1571, they, with the Maltese,\r\nbehaved most courageously at the battle of Lepanto, where the Turks lost\r\n30,000 men. Though waging perpetual war with the Turks, the knights\r\ncontinued in possession of Malta until 1798, when it surrendered to\r\nNapoleon, and received a French garrison. In 1800 it was blockaded by a\r\nBritish squadron, and was forced to surrender to the English, in whose\r\npossession it has remained as a dependency.\r\n\r\n=Malta, Knights of.= See ST. JOHN OF JERUSALEM, KNIGHTS OF.\r\n\r\n=Maltese Cross.= A cross of eight points, of the form worn as a\r\ndecoration by the Hospitallers and other orders of knighthood.\r\n\r\n=Malvern Hill.= Near the James River, in Virginia. Here, on the night of\r\nJune 30, 1862, all the divisions of the Army of the Potomac, under Gen.\r\nMcClellan, were united in a strong position, after five days of\r\nincessant marching and fighting. About 4 A.M. on July 1 the Confederate\r\nforces advanced to storm this position, but were mowed down by a\r\ndestructive fire of grape from the land batteries, and were obliged to\r\nseek shelter in the woods. The gunboats, also, which were within range,\r\nopened a destructive fire of shells on the enemy. The attack was a\r\ncomplete failure, the loss of the Confederates being considerable, while\r\nthat of the Federals was insignificant. After this repulse, the\r\nConfederates retired to Richmond, and McClellan pursued his way to the\r\nJames, arriving at Harrison’s Landing on July 3.\r\n\r\n=Mameliere= (_Fr._). Armor for the breast, from which depended two\r\nchains, one attached to the pommel, and the other to the scabbard of the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n=Mamelukes= (Arabic, _mamluk_, a “slave”). The name given to the slaves\r\nof the beys, brought from the Caucasus, and who formed their armed\r\nforces. When Genghis Khan desolated a great part of Asia in the 13th\r\ncentury, and carried away a multitude of the inhabitants for slaves, the\r\nsultan of Egypt bought 12,000 of them, partly Mingrelians and Tartars,\r\nbut mostly Turks, and formed them into a body of troops. But they soon\r\nfound their own power so great that, in 1254, they made one of their own\r\nnumber sultan of Egypt, founding the dynasty of the Baharites, which\r\ngave place to another Mameluke dynasty in 1382. The Caucasian element\r\npredominated in the first dynasty, the Tartar element in the second.\r\nSelim I., who overthrew the Mameluke kingdom in 1517, was compelled to\r\npermit the continuance of the 24 Mameluke beys as governors of the\r\nprovinces; but in the middle of the 18th century they regained such a\r\npreponderance of power in Egypt that the pasha named by the Porte was\r\nreduced to a nominal ruler. The number of them scattered throughout all\r\nEgypt was between 10,000 and 12,000 men. Their number was kept up\r\nchiefly by slaves brought from the Caucasus, from among whom the beys\r\nand other officers of state were exclusively chosen. Their last\r\nbrilliant achievements were on the occasion of the French invasion of\r\nEgypt, and during the time immediately following the retirement of the\r\nFrench. At this time Murad Bey stood at their head. But in 1811 they\r\nwere foully massacred by Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\n=Mamertini.= Sons of Mamers, or Mars, were Campanian soldiers of\r\nAgathocles. They seized Messina, in Sicily, in 281 B.C., and when\r\nclosely besieged by the Carthaginians and Hiero of Syracuse in 264, they\r\nimplored the help of the Romans, which led to the first Punic war.\r\n\r\n=Mammoth Powder.= See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Man.= To supply with men; to furnish with a sufficient force or\r\ncomplement of men, as for management, service, defense, or the like.\r\nAlso, to supply with strength for action; to prepare for efficiency; to\r\nfortify.\r\n\r\n=Man, Isle of.= An island of Great Britain, in the Irish Sea, nearly\r\nequidistant from the coasts of England, Scotland, and Ireland. It was\r\nsubdued by the king of Northumberland, 621; by Magnus of Norway, 1092;\r\nceded to the Scots, 1266, and taken from them in 1314 by Montacute,\r\nafterwards earl of Salisbury; it subsequently fell to the Earl of Derby.\r\nThe brave Countess of Derby held this island against the troops of the\r\nParliament in 1651, after her husband had been beheaded at Bolton,\r\nEngland, in the same year for his devotion to the royal cause.\r\n\r\n=Manassas.= A town in Prince William Co., Va., which was an important\r\nmilitary position during the civil war, and where the Alexandria and\r\nManassas Gap Railways meet, near a creek called Bull Run; it was held by\r\nthe Confederates in 1861, when they were attacked by the Federal general\r\nIrvin McDowell. He began his march from Washington on July 16, and\r\ngained some advantage on the 18th at Centreville. On the 21st was fought\r\nthe _first_ battle of Bull Run. The Federals, who began the fight, had\r\nthe advantage till about 3 o’clock P.M., when the Confederate general\r\nJohnston brought up reinforcements, which at first the Federals took for\r\ntheir own troops. After a brief resistance, the latter were seized with\r\nsudden panic, and in spite of the utmost efforts of their officers, fled\r\nin disgraceful rout, abandoning a large quantity of arms, ammunition,\r\nand baggage. The Confederate generals, Johnston and Beauregard, did not\r\nthink it prudent to pursue the fugitives, who did not halt till they\r\nreached Washington. The Federal army is said to have had 481 killed,\r\n1011 wounded, and 1216 missing. The loss of the Confederates was stated\r\nto be about 1500. In March, 1862, when the Army of the Potomac under\r\nGen. McClellan marched into Virginia, they found that the Confederates\r\nhad quietly retreated from the camp at Manassas. On August 30, 1862,\r\nthis place was the site of another great battle between the Northern and\r\nSouthern armies. In August, Gen. “Stonewall” Jackson, after compelling\r\nthe Federal general Pope to retreat, defeated him at Cedar Mountain on\r\nthe 9th, turned his flank on the 22d, and arriving at Manassas repulsed\r\nhis attacks on the 29th. On the 30th, Gen. R. E. Lee (who had defeated\r\nGen. McClellan and the invading Northern army before Richmond, June 26\r\nto July 1) joined Jackson with his army, and Pope received\r\nreinforcements from Washington. A desperate conflict ensued, which ended\r\nin the Confederates gaining a decisive victory, compelling the Federals\r\nto a hasty retreat to Centreville, where they were once more routed,\r\nSeptember 1. The remains of their army took refuge behind the lines of\r\nWashington on September 2. Pope was at once superseded, and McClellan\r\nresumed the command to march against the Confederates, who had crossed\r\nthe Potomac and entered Maryland.\r\n\r\n=Manch=, or =Maunch=. A charge frequently used in heraldry to represent\r\na sleeve with long pendent ends, of the form worn by ladies in the reign\r\nof Henry I.\r\n\r\n=Manchester.= A city of England, in Lancashire, on the Irwell. In the\r\ntime of the Druids, it was one of their principal stations. It was one\r\nof the seats of the Brigantes, who had a castle or stronghold called\r\n_Mancenion_; and was, about 79, selected by the Romans as a station, and\r\ncalled _Mancunium_. Called by the Saxons _Manceastre_. Taken from the\r\nBritons, 488; captured by Edwin of Northumbria, 620; taken by the Danes,\r\n877; retaken, 923.\r\n\r\n=Mandans.= A tribe of Indians of the Dakota family, who are located with\r\nthe Arickarees and Gros Ventres on a reservation near Fort Berthold,\r\nDakota. They were hostile to the Sioux, and more friendly to the whites\r\nthan the neighboring tribes. They number about 250.\r\n\r\n=Mandarin.= A general term applied to Chinese officers of every grade by\r\nforeigners. It is derived from the Portuguese _mandar_, “to command”;\r\nthe Chinese equivalent is _kwan_. There are nine ranks, each\r\ndistinguished by a different-colored ball or button placed on the apex\r\nof the cap, by a peculiar emblazonry on the breast, and a different\r\nclasp of the girdle. The military mandarins are selected by the emperor\r\nof China to superintend and command the militia of the country.\r\n\r\n=Mandilion.= A soldier’s loose coat; an outer garment without sleeves.\r\n\r\n=Mandrel.= In forging, is a rod used to preserve the interior form of\r\nhollow-work. Also, the spindle upon which an article is placed in\r\nshaping it in a lathe.\r\n\r\n=Manduria= (now _Casal Nova_). A town in Calabria, on the road from\r\nTarentum to Hydruntum, and near a small lake. Here Archidamus III., king\r\nof Sparta, was defeated and slain in battle by the Messapians and\r\nLucanians, 338 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Manège.= The art of horsemanship or of training horses. Also, a school\r\nfor teaching horsemanship, and for training horses; a riding-school.\r\n\r\n=Mangalore.= A seaport town and fortress of Hindostan, on the eastern\r\nshore of the Indian Ocean, in the province of Canara. The Portuguese had\r\na factory here, which was destroyed by the Arabians. In 1793 the town\r\nwas taken by Hyder Ali, then the Mysore general; in 1768 it was captured\r\nby a detachment from Bombay; but was shortly afterwards retaken by\r\nHyder. In 1783 Mangalore again surrendered to a force from Bombay; and\r\nafter the destruction of Gen. Matthews’s army, sustained a long siege\r\nfrom Tippoo Sahib, and was gallantly defended by Col. Campbell. Upon the\r\nconclusion of peace in 1784, it was restored, and the fortifications\r\nwere dismantled. In 1799, on the overthrow of Tippoo, it was finally\r\ntaken possession of by the British.\r\n\r\n=Mangan= (_Fr._). This word is sometimes written _mangon_, a warlike\r\nmachine formerly used. The term itself was generally adopted to signify\r\nany species of warlike machine. But it more particularly meant the\r\nlargest and most powerful machine that could be used for warlike\r\npurposes; whether it was practiced to throw enormous stones against\r\nbesieged places, or to cast javelins, etc. It was likewise called\r\n_ballista_, from the Greek, _tormentum_, from the Latin, _torquendo_,\r\nand sometimes _petraria_, because stones weighing upwards of 360 pounds\r\nwere thrown from it. This machine answered the double purpose of\r\ndefending or attacking fortified places, and it was sometimes used at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n=Mangonel= (Fr. _mangonel_, _mangoneau_). A very strong and powerful\r\ncross-bow, from 15 to 20 feet long, for throwing arrows, darts, or\r\nstones. The _trebuchet_, _ribaudequin_, etc., were only a variety of the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n=Manheim=, or =Mannheim=. A town of Germany, in the grand duchy of\r\nBaden, at the confluence of the Neckar and the Rhine. It surrendered to\r\nthe French, under command of Pichegru, September 20, 1795. On October\r\n31, the Austrians under Wurmser defeated the French near the city.\r\nSeveral battles were fought with various success in the neighborhood\r\nduring the late wars.\r\n\r\n=Manifesto=, or =Manifest=. A public declaration, usually of a prince or\r\nsovereign, showing his intentions, or proclaiming his opinions and\r\nmotives in reference to some act done or contemplated by him; as, a\r\nmanifesto declaring the purpose of a prince to begin war, and explaining\r\nhis motives.\r\n\r\n=Maniglions.= The two handles on the back of a piece of ordnance.\r\n\r\n=Manilla=, or =Manila=. A town of the island of Luzon, and the capital\r\nof the Spanish settlements in the Philippine Islands. It was taken by\r\nthe English in 1757; and again in October, 1762, by storm.\r\n\r\n=Manipularis= (Fr. _manipulaire_). The chief officer in a part of the\r\nRoman infantry called _manipulus_, was so called. This officer was\r\nlikewise ordinary (Fr. _ordinaire_).\r\n\r\n=Manipulus.= So called from its standard or flag, which was made of\r\ncloth, and hung suspended on a staff with a hand. The manipulus was\r\ndistinguished in this manner from the chief standard of each legion,\r\nwhich was an eagle of massive metal.\r\n\r\n=Manipulus= (Fr. _manipule_). A small body of infantry originally, so\r\ncalled among the Romans during the reign of Romulus. Their ensign was a\r\nhand on the end of a staff. The manipulus consisted of 100 men, and in\r\nthe days of the consuls and first Cæsars, of 200. Three manipuli\r\nconstituted a Roman cohort. Each manipulus was commanded by two officers\r\ncalled _centurions_, one of whom acted as lieutenant to the other. Every\r\nmanipulus made two centuries, or _ordines_. This, however, cannot be\r\nsaid to have been the uniform establishment or formation of the\r\nmanipulus; for according to Varro and Vegetius, it was the smallest body\r\nof men employed in the Roman armies, and composed the tenth part of a\r\ncentury. Spartian says, “it consisted of only ten soldiers.” Some\r\nauthorities assert that it takes its name from _manipulus_, “a handful\r\nof straw,” the latter having been fixed to a long pole to serve as a\r\nrallying signal, before the eagles were adopted. This circumstance has\r\ngiven rise to the modern expression, a handful of men, _une poignée de\r\ngens_. Vegetius, on the other hand, says it comes from _manus_, which\r\nsignified a small body or handful of men collected together, and\r\nfollowing the same standard; and Modestus as well as Varro state it to\r\nhave been so called because, when they went into action, they took each\r\nother by the hand, or fought all together. A French writer conceives\r\nthat the manipulus may be considered as one of those parts of a modern\r\nbattalion which are distributed in different rooms, etc., and which is\r\ncalled _une chambree_, or a company that messes together.\r\n\r\n=Manly.= Having qualities becoming a man; firm; brave; undaunted; noble,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Mannite, Nitro-.= A high explosive resembling nitro-glycerine in its\r\nproperties, and made in an analogous manner by the action of nitric and\r\nsulphuric acids upon mannite, a form of sugar.\r\n\r\n=Manœuvre=, or =Maneuver=. Management; dexterous movement; specifically,\r\nan evolution, movement, or change of position among military or naval\r\nbodies. To perform a movement in military or naval tactics; to make an\r\nevolution. Also, to change the positions of, as troops or ships.\r\n\r\n=Manœuvring-wheels.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, SEA-COAST CARRIAGES.\r\n\r\n=Manresa.= A town of Spain, in Catalonia, 30 miles northwest from\r\nBarcelona. It suffered much in the war of independence; and in March,\r\n1811, it was almost completely burnt to the ground by Marshal Macdonald.\r\n\r\n=Mans, Le.= A city of France, formerly capital of the province of Maine,\r\nnow of the department of Sarthe. The final struggle between the Vendean\r\ntroops and the French republicans took place here in 1793, in which the\r\nlatter were victorious; and in 1871, another battle took place between\r\nthe Germans and French, in which the former were victorious.\r\n\r\n=Mansoura=, or =Mansourah=. A town of Lower Egypt, 34 miles southwest\r\nfrom Dalmietta. Here Louis IX. was defeated by the Saracens and taken\r\nprisoner, April 5, 1250. Some French troops which occupied the garrison\r\nwere massacred here in 1798.\r\n\r\n=Manteau= (_Fr._). This word, which literally signifies a cloak, is\r\nfrequently used among the French to express the covering that hussars or\r\nlight infantry troops carry for the double purpose of shielding their\r\nbodies from the inclemencies of the weather in outposts, etc., and for\r\nspreading over their heads, by means of poles, when they occasionally\r\nhalt, and take a position.\r\n\r\n=Mantelet= (_Fr._). A large osier buckler which was used in ancient\r\ntimes; it was held upright, under cover of which archers shot their\r\narrows. Also a circular frame upon wheels covered with osier or\r\nhorse-hair, used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n=Mantes.= A town of France, in the department of Seine-et-Oise, 30 miles\r\nwest-northwest of Paris. It was taken and reduced to ashes by William\r\nthe Conqueror in 1087.\r\n\r\n=Mantillis.= A kind of shield, anciently fixed upon the tops of ships as\r\na cover for archers.\r\n\r\n=Mantinea=, or =Mantinœa=. Anciently a city of the Morea, 9 miles north\r\nfrom Tripolitza. It is now the modern Greek village of Palespoli. It was\r\nfamous as being the scene of several battles, of which the most\r\nimportant was that fought between the Spartans and the Thebans under\r\nEpaminondas (362 B.C.), in which the former were defeated.\r\n\r\n=Mantle.= A long flowing robe, worn in the Middle Ages over the armor,\r\nand fastened by a fibula in front, or at the right shoulder. The mantle\r\nis an important part of the official insignia of the various orders of\r\nknighthood.\r\n\r\n=Mantlet.= A sort of temporary fortification intended to protect the men\r\nworking guns in embrasures, casemates, or port-holes from the bullets of\r\nsharpshooters. The mantlet is usually made to be hoisted up while the\r\ngunner takes aim, and then lowered to cover the whole opening except a\r\ncircular aperture for the muzzle of the cannon. With every increase in\r\nthe range and precision of small-arms, mantlets become more essential\r\nfor the safety of gunners. Mantlets are made of thick fir, of solid oak\r\nplanks, or of iron plates, the last being preferable, as the lightest.\r\nAt Sebastopol, the Russians effectively blocked their embrasures by\r\nthick mantlets of plaited rope suspended freely. A mantlet of planks or\r\niron plates, about 5 feet high, and occasionally mounted on small\r\nwheels, is also used to protect sappers working at the end of a sap,\r\nalthough a rolling gabion is preferred for this purpose by many\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\n=Mantling=, or =Lambrequin=. A heraldic ornament depicted as hanging\r\ndown from the helmet, and behind the escutcheon. It is considered to\r\nrepresent either the cointise (an ornamental scarf which passed round\r\nthe body and over the shoulder) or the military mantle or robe of\r\nestate. When intended for the cointise, it is cut into irregular strips\r\nand curls of the most capricious forms, whose contortions are supposed\r\nto indicate that it has been torn into that ragged condition in the\r\nfield of battle. When the mantling is treated as a robe of estate, the\r\nbearings of the shield are sometimes embroidered on it. A mantling\r\nadjusted so as to form a background for the shield and its accessories\r\nconstitutes an _Achievement of Arms_. In British heraldry, the mantling\r\nof the sovereign is of gold lined with ermine; that of peers, of crimson\r\nvelvet lined with ermine. Knights and gentlemen have generally crimson\r\nvelvet lined with white satin; but sometimes the livery colors are\r\nadopted instead, as is generally the practice in continental heraldry.\r\n\r\n=Mantonet= (_Fr._). A small piece of wood or iron, which is notched, for\r\nthe purpose of hanging anything upon it. The pegs in soldiers’ rooms are\r\nsometimes so called.\r\n\r\n=Mantua.= A fortified city of Northern Italy, 22 miles southwest from\r\nVerona. Mantua is both by nature and art one of the strongest places in\r\nEurope. It can boast of an antiquity almost equal to that of Rome, and\r\nexperienced all the vicissitudes of the Middle Ages, and, like other\r\nItalian cities, emerged from them into liberty and independence. It\r\nsurrendered to the French, February 2, 1797, after a siege of eight\r\nmonths; was retaken by the Austrian and Russian army, July 30, 1799,\r\nafter a short siege. In 1800, after the battle of Marengo, the French\r\nagain obtained possession of it. It was included in the kingdom of Italy\r\ntill 1814, when it was restored to the Austrians, who surrendered it to\r\nthe Italians, October 11, 1866, after the peace.\r\n\r\n=Manual.= Book of reference; as, ordnance manual, etc.\r\n\r\n=Manual.= A prescribed exercise by means of which soldiers are taught to\r\nhandle and use their weapons. The _manual of arms_ is the exercise with\r\nthe musket; the _manual of the piece_, the exercise with the field-gun.\r\nThere are also _manuals for the sabre, pistol_, etc.\r\n\r\n=Manuballiste= (_Fr._). A cross-bow. There were two kinds in the reign\r\nof Henry VII., viz., the _latch_ which was used for quarrels, and the\r\n_prodd_ for bullets.\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Ordnance.= See ORDNANCE, MANUFACTURE OF.\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Powder.= See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Manx.= Pertaining to the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n=Maoris.= A New Zealand word signifying _native_, is the name given to\r\nthemselves by the inhabitants of New Zealand, and that by which they are\r\nnow usually designated. In 1861 war broke out between them and the\r\nBritish, terminating in favor of the latter in 1862; but in 1863 the\r\nMaoris recommenced hostilities, and a formidable conspiracy was formed\r\nto expel the British troops. In 1868 they massacred many settlers and\r\noffered a desperate resistance, and were not subdued until the following\r\nyear. They numbered at that time about 40,000. They are now\r\ncomparatively peaceable.\r\n\r\n=Map.= In a military and geographical sense, is a plane figure,\r\nrepresenting the surface of the earth, or a part thereof, according to\r\nthe law of the particular kind of projection used; distinguishing the\r\nsituation of cities, mountains, rivers, roads, etc.\r\n\r\n=Marathon.= A village on the east shore of Attica, 20 miles northeast\r\nfrom Athens. Here on September 28 and 29, 490 B.C., the Greeks, only\r\n10,000 strong, defeated the Persian army amounting to 200,000, who had\r\n6400 killed. The Greek loss was 192 Athenians killed, besides some\r\nPlatæans and slaves. The Greeks were commanded by Miltiades, Aristides,\r\nand Themistocles. Among the slain was Hippias, the instigator of the\r\nwar. The Persian army was forced to retreat to Asia.\r\n\r\n=Marathus.= An important city on the coast of Phœnicia, opposite to\r\nAradus. It was destroyed by the people of Aradus in the time of the\r\nSyrian king, Alexander Balas, a little before 150 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Maraud.= To rove in quest of plunder; to make an excursion for booty;\r\nto plunder.\r\n\r\n=Marauder.= A rover in quest of booty or plunder; a plunderer.\r\n\r\n=Marauding.= Is irregular plunder or violence offered to the inhabitants\r\nof a country by the individuals of an army. In all armies where\r\ndiscipline is maintained, marauding is, at least professedly, punished\r\nby death; the provost-marshal having power to inflict that penalty\r\nsummarily on all offenders taken in the act. Marauding is also applied\r\nto plundering at sea; as, the Barbary corsairs are systematic\r\nmarauders.\r\n\r\n=Marburg.= A town of Germany, in Hesse-Cassel, situated on the Lahn. It\r\nsuffered much during the Seven Years’ War, 1753-60.\r\n\r\n=March.= The movement of a body of men from one place to another. In\r\nmarching it cannot be too strongly inculcated that every just movement\r\nand manœuvre depends upon the correct equality of march established and\r\npracticed by all the troops of the same army, and that when this is not\r\nattended to confusion must follow on the junction of several battalions.\r\nAlso, the distance marched over; as, a march of 20 miles.\r\n\r\n=March.= To cause to move in military array; to push forward, as troops;\r\nto cause to advance in a steady, regular, or stately manner.\r\n\r\n=March.= The military signal for soldiers to move; a piece of music,\r\ndesigned or fitted to accompany and guide the movement of troops; or a\r\npiece of music composed after the measure of a march. Also, the command\r\nfor soldiers to move.\r\n\r\n=March.= The length of a day’s march for troops of any arm depends, to a\r\ngreat extent, upon the condition of the roads, the supply of water,\r\nforage, etc.; also upon the advantages to be gained over an enemy.\r\n\r\nInfantry marches at the rate in common time of 90 steps = 70 yards in\r\none minute, or 2 miles 680 yards in an hour; in quick time, 110 steps =\r\n86 yards in one minute, or 2 miles 1613 yards in an hour; in double\r\ntime, 165 steps = 151¹⁄₄ yards in one minute, or 5 miles 275 yards in an\r\nhour. Under ordinary circumstances infantry should march from 15 to 20\r\nmiles a day, halting about ten minutes every hour.\r\n\r\nCavalry should march about 20 miles a day, and be kept at a walk,\r\nhalting several times during the day, when the men should dismount and\r\npermit the horses to refresh themselves by giving them a few mouthfuls\r\nof grass and water. On a forced march the horses should not be halted,\r\nbut they should be relieved fifteen minutes every hour by dismounting\r\nthe men and requiring them to march. For selection of cavalry horses,\r\nrate of speed at a trot, gallop, etc., see HORSE.\r\n\r\nThe march of artillery should be governed by the movements of the arms\r\nof the service to which it is assigned for duty. The care of men and\r\nhorses is a combination of what has been laid down for cavalry and\r\ninfantry. For the rates of march of, and loads carried by, artillery\r\nhorses, see PACK AND DRAUGHT HORSES.\r\n\r\n=Marchands= (_Fr._). Slop-sellers, petty sutlers. Men of this\r\ndescription always flock round and follow an army on its march. As they\r\ngenerally deal in articles which are required by the officers and\r\nsoldiers, it is the business of every general to see them properly\r\ntreated, to insure their safety, and to permit them, under certain\r\nregulations, to have access to the camp.\r\n\r\n=Marcher.= One who marches. In ancient times the lord or officer who\r\ndefended the marches or borders of a territory.\r\n\r\n=Marches.= A frontier, a border. In English history, the boundary\r\nbetween England and Wales, also between England and Scotland.\r\n\r\n=Marches, Combined.= When the movements of the divisions or corps are\r\nmade independent of each other, but having the same object in common,\r\nthey are known as combined marches. They are arranged with the intention\r\nof having the several columns arrive at a given position but coming from\r\ndifferent directions.--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Marches, Flank.= Are marches made parallel or obliquely to the enemy’s\r\nposition. They are used when it is desired to turn the enemy’s position\r\nor attack him on the flank.--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Marches, Manœuvre.= Marches are sometimes made by which an army gains a\r\nposition, the possession of which compels the enemy to leave the\r\nposition he is occupying. If these marches are under the observation of\r\nthe enemy, they are termed “manœuvres”; but if made out of his sight,\r\nthey are called _manœuvre marches_.--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Marches of Concentration.= The marches which are made by several bodies\r\nof troops, starting from points separated from each other, for the\r\npurpose of bringing these troops together at some stated place, are\r\ntermed _marches of concentration_. Forced marches are much used in\r\nconcentrating troops, especially before a battle. Many examples are\r\ngiven in military history.\r\n\r\nFriant’s division of Davoust’s corps marched over 80 miles in\r\nforty-eight hours in 1805, to join Napoleon in the battle of Austerlitz.\r\nCraufurd’s brigade marched, so Napier says, 62 miles in twenty-six\r\nhours, to join Wellington at Talavera, in 1809. Napoleon marched an army\r\nto the relief of Dresden, in 1813, by forced marches of over 30 miles a\r\nday for three consecutive days. The marches of the different corps of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac on the 30th of June and the 1st of July, 1863,\r\nby means of which the army was concentrated at Gettysburg, are good\r\nexamples of _marches of concentration_. The 6th Corps under Gen.\r\nSedgwick made on this occasion a march over 30 miles.--_Prof. J. B.\r\nWheeler._\r\n\r\n=Marches, Route.= Route marches are used by troops both during war and\r\nin peace. They are used in peace to conduct a body of troops from one\r\nstation or post to another. They are used in war for the purpose of\r\nassembling the fractions of an army on its base of operations; of\r\nconducting troops through a district or country where there is no enemy,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of _route marches_, according to the manner in\r\nwhich they are made, viz.: _ordinary_, _forced_, and _marches by rail_.\r\n\r\n_Ordinary route marches_ are those made along ordinary roads and where\r\nthe length of the march in any one day is not greater than 20 miles.\r\nTwenty miles is a long march, especially if the body of troops is\r\nlarge, and this distance is taken as the limit for an ordinary march. If\r\nthe distance marched in any one day is greater than 20 miles, the march\r\nis _forced_.\r\n\r\n_Forced marches_ are extremely exhausting upon the troops and should not\r\nexceed 30 miles per day, although greater distances have been overcome\r\nby good troops. The number of forced marches made in succession must be\r\nfew, only two or three, even for the best of troops. They are used but\r\nrarely in time of peace, and then only under pressing circumstances.\r\nThey are much used in war, when a rapid concentration of troops is to be\r\nmade; when a strategical combination is to be effected, etc.\r\n\r\n_Route marches by rail_ are employed both in peace and war. This kind of\r\nmarch includes all those in which the troops do not actually march, but\r\nare transported bodily to their destination. Railroads have become in\r\nrecent years the great factor in rapid and cheap means of moving troops,\r\nand the term “rail” is therefore applied to this method of conducting\r\ntroops from one place to another.\r\n\r\nThis method is of especial service when the time given to the troops to\r\nreach their destination is short, and the distance is great. It is\r\nespecially used in the case of assembling armies and forwarding the\r\nreserves and recruits to the theatre of war. The late war in the United\r\nStates, the war in 1859 in Italy, the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, etc.,\r\nall furnish examples.--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Marches, Strategical.= Marches which made in the theatre of war, near\r\nan enemy whose position is not exactly known, having in general for\r\ntheir object the completion of some strategical combination, are\r\ndesignated _strategical marches_. They are used to conduct an army to a\r\nposition from which an attack can be made on the enemy, or to a position\r\nin which the army can remain and receive an attack; in other words, to a\r\nposition immediately in the presence of the enemy.\r\n\r\n_Strategical marches_ are either _ordinary_ or _forced_ marches, and are\r\nused principally to mass troops at some stated point on the theatre of\r\noperations before the enemy can make arrangements to prevent it or can\r\nprepare counter-movements to weaken or nullify the effect of the\r\nmovement. Secrecy, celerity, and good order are therefore indispensable\r\nrequisites for success in marches of this kind.--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Marches, Tactical.= Marches made in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nenemy, and so near that they may be observed by him, are called\r\n_tactical marches_. Since these marches are made very near the enemy,\r\ngreater precautions are required to guard against an attack than are\r\nnecessary in _strategical marches_.\r\n\r\n_Tactical marches_ differ from _route_ and _strategical_ marches in one\r\nmaterial particular, and that is in the number and sizes of the\r\nwagon-trains accompanying the troops on the march. Both in _route_ and\r\n_strategical_ marches the troops are cumbered with long and unwieldy\r\nwagon-trains carrying the baggage and supplies of the army, whereas in a\r\n_tactical_ march there are none, or the trains are reduced to a minimum.\r\nSince the enemy may attack the moving columns at any minute, everything\r\nis sacrificed to the important one of being ready to fight at a minute’s\r\nnotice, and the army carries with it only supplies enough for two or\r\nthree days, and little or no baggage. Everything not essential for\r\nfeeding the troops and not necessary for fighting is therefore left\r\nbehind the army while it is making a _tactical march_.--_Prof. J. B.\r\nWheeler._\r\n\r\n=Marchfeld.= In Austria, where Ottocar II. of Bohemia was defeated and\r\nslain by his rival, the emperor Rodolph of Hapsburg, August 26, 1278.\r\n\r\n=Marching.= One of the first necessities to distinguish a body of\r\ndisciplined troops from a mere crowd of men is a regular cadenced step,\r\ntaken by every individual at the same time, and with the same foot. When\r\ntroops are to march a long distance the _route_ step is employed, the\r\nmen keeping the same distance and their places in the ranks as when\r\nmarching on drills, parades, reviews, musters, etc., where the cadenced\r\nstep in common, quick, or double time is employed. In the U. S. service\r\nthe length of the step in common and quick time is 28 inches, and the\r\ncadence is at the rate of 90 steps per minute for common time and 110\r\nfor quick time; in double time the length of the step is 33 inches and\r\nthe cadence at the rate of 165 steps per minute, but it may be increased\r\nto 180. In the feudal ages, when infantry fell into disrepute, cadenced\r\nmarching was unattended to, and seems only to have been thoroughly\r\nrevived by Marshal Saxe.\r\n\r\n=Marching Money.= The additional pay which officers and soldiers receive\r\nfor the purpose of covering the expense necessarily incurred when\r\nmarching from one place to another.\r\n\r\n=Marching Order.= In the British service a soldier is said to be in\r\nmarching order when he is fully equipped with arms, ammunition, and a\r\nportion of his kit, which weighs from 30 to 35 pounds. In _service\r\nmarching_ order, by the addition of provisions and some campaigning\r\nnecessaries, he carries nearly 50 pounds. But _heavy marching order_,\r\nwhich was yet heavier, is now happily abolished. See HEAVY MARCHING\r\nORDER, and LIGHT MARCHING ORDER.\r\n\r\n=Marching Orders.= The orders issued preparatory to troops marching; and\r\nin the British service signifies six days’ journey at least.\r\n\r\n=Marching Regiments.= A term given in England to those who had not any\r\npermanent quarters, but were liable to be sent not only from one end of\r\nGreat Britain to another, but to the most distant of her possessions\r\nabroad. Although the word _marching_ is insensibly confounded with those\r\nof _line_ and _regulars_, it was originally meant to convey something\r\nmore than a mere liability to be ordered upon any service; for by\r\nmarching the regular troops from one town to another, the inhabitants,\r\nwho from time immemorial have been jealous of a standing army, lost\r\ntheir antipathy to real soldiers, by the occasional absence of regular\r\ntroops. At present the English guards, infantry, etc., may be considered\r\nmore or less as marching regiments. The marines and volunteers have\r\nstationary quarters.\r\n\r\n=Marcomanni.= A powerful confederacy of ancient Germans, who were\r\nresident, as their name imports, on the borders. They are first\r\nmentioned in history by Cæsar, and seem at that time to have dwelt upon\r\nthe banks of the Rhine. From Tacitus and several others we learn that\r\nthey soon afterwards moved westward, under their king Maroboduus, drove\r\nthe Boii out of Bohemia, and settled in that country. After organizing a\r\ngovernment, Maroboduus formed a league with the neighboring tribes, for\r\nthe purpose of defending Germany against the Romans. He was thus enabled\r\nto muster 70,000 disciplined soldiers, and to conclude an honorable\r\ntreaty with the emperor Tiberius in 6 A.D. In 17 he was defeated by the\r\nCherusci, and in two years afterwards he was expelled from his throne by\r\nthe Goth Catualda, and forced to seek refuge in Italy. The same fate\r\nsoon afterwards befell his dethroner and successor, and the Marcomanni\r\nonce more came under the sway of native kings. After this they gradually\r\nextended their dominions, until they had reached the Danube, and had\r\nprovoked the jealousy of the Romans in the time of Domitian. Then began\r\nhostilities between the Romans and the Marcomanni, which led to the\r\nprotracted struggle of the Marcomannic war, during the reign of Marcus\r\nAurelius, but was finally quelled by the peace of Commodus, in 180.\r\nFavored, however, by the feeble rule of Commodus, they continued their\r\npredatory inroads into the Roman provinces of Noricum and Rhætia, and\r\nventured sometimes as far as the defiles of the Alps. In 270, in the\r\nreign of Aurelian, they pushed forward into Italy, and penetrated even\r\nto Ancona, spreading consternation around them. After this period they\r\ndisappear gradually, and are mentioned for the last time among the\r\nhordes of Attila.\r\n\r\n=Marcouf, St.= Two small islands of France, in the department Manche,\r\nand which protect the roadstead off Cape La Hogue. They were taken by\r\nthe British in 1795, but restored to France at the peace of Amiens.\r\n\r\n=Maréchal= (_Fr._). Major-general.\r\n\r\n=Maréchal de Bataille= (_Fr._). A military rank which once existed in\r\nFrance, but was suppressed before the revolution, or rather confined to\r\nthe body-guards. An officer belonging to that corps received it as an\r\nhonorary title. Its original functions, etc., with respect to general\r\nservice, sunk in the appointments of _maréchal de camp_ and\r\nmajor-general. It was first created by Louis XIII. _Maréchal-général\r\ndes logis de la cavalerie_, this appointment took place under Charles\r\nIX. in 1594. He had the chief direction of everything which related to\r\nthe French cavalry. _Maréchal des logis pour les vivres_, a person\r\nbelonging to the quartermaster-general’s department was so called in the\r\nold French service.\r\n\r\n=Maréchal de Camp= (_Fr._). A military rank which existed during the\r\nFrench monarchy. The person invested with it was a general officer, and\r\nranked next to a lieutenant-general. It was his duty to see the army\r\nproperly disposed of in camp or quarters, to be present at all the\r\nmovements that were made; to be the first to mount his charger, and the\r\nlast to quit him. He commanded the left in all attacks. The appointment\r\nunder this distinction was first created by Henry IV. in 1598.\r\n\r\n=Maréchal-Général des Camps et Armées du Roi= (_Fr._). A post of high\r\ndignity and trust, which during the French monarchy was annexed to the\r\nrank of _maréchal de France_. Military writers differ with respect to\r\nthe privileges, etc., which belonged to this appointment; it is,\r\nhowever, generally acknowledged that the general officer who held it was\r\nintrusted with the whole management of a siege, being subordinate only\r\nto the constable, or to any other _maréchal de France_, who was his\r\nsenior in appointment.\r\n\r\n=Maréchal-Général des Logis de l’Armée= (_Fr._). This appointment,\r\nwhich existed during the old French government, and has since been\r\nreplaced by the _chef de l’état-major_, corresponds with that of\r\nquartermaster-general in the British service.\r\n\r\n=Maréchaussées de France= (_Fr._). A species of military police which\r\nformerly existed in France. During the French monarchy there were 31\r\ncompanies of _maréchaussées à cheval_, or mounted policemen. These\r\ncompanies first formed for the purpose of preserving public\r\ntranquillity, and were distributed in the different provinces of the\r\nkingdom. This useful body of men was first formed under Philip I. in\r\n1060; they were afterwards suppressed, and again re-established in 1720,\r\nas constituting a part of the gendarmerie of France. There were other\r\ncompanies of _maréchaussées_, who were particularly distinguished from\r\nthe 31 above mentioned; such, for instance, as that of the constables,\r\ncalled the gendarmerie.\r\n\r\n=Marengo.= A village of Italy, in Piedmont, near the Bormida, 2 miles\r\nsoutheast from Alessandria. Here the French army, commanded by\r\nBonaparte, attacked the Austrians, June 14, 1800; his army was\r\nretreating, when the arrival of Gen. Dessaix turned the fortunes of the\r\nday. The slaughter on both sides was dreadful. By this victory Bonaparte\r\ngained 12 strong fortresses, and became master of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Margarita.= An island in the Caribbean Sea lies off the coast of\r\nVenezuela, of which republic it forms a province. This island was first\r\nvisited by Columbus in 1498, and has in more recent times (1816) been\r\nthe scene of a bloody warfare between the revolutionists and the Spanish\r\ntroops under Gen. Murillo, in which the latter were defeated.\r\n\r\n=Margrave.= A German nobleman corresponding in rank to the English\r\nmarquis. _Margravine_ is the wife of a margrave.\r\n\r\n=Margum=, or =Margus=. A fortified place in Mœsia Superior, west of\r\nViminacium, situated on the river Margus (now _Morava_), at its\r\nconfluence with the Danube. Here Diocletian gained a decisive victory\r\nover Carinus.\r\n\r\n=Maricopa Indians.= A tribe of aborigines, numbering about 400, who are\r\nlocated with the Pimas on a reservation on the Gila River, Arizona,\r\nabout 180 miles above its mouth. They are peaceable, and follow\r\nagricultural pursuits.\r\n\r\n=Marienbourg.= A fortified town of Belgium, situated in the province of\r\nNamur. This place was occupied by the French from 1659 till 1815.\r\n\r\n=Marignano= (now _Malegnano_). A village of Northern Italy, near Milan.\r\nThree battles have been fought near here: (1) Francis I. of France\r\ndefeated the Duke of Milan and the Swiss, September 13-14, 1515; above\r\n20,000 men were slain; this conflict has been called the “battle of the\r\ngiants.” (2) Near here was fought the battle of Pavia. (See PAVIA.) (3)\r\nAfter the battle of Magenta, June 4, 1859, the Austrians intrenched\r\nthemselves at Malegnano. Marshal Baraguay d’Hilliers with 16,000 men was\r\nsent to dislodge them, which he did, on June 8, with a loss of about 850\r\nkilled and wounded. The Austrians suffered severely.\r\n\r\n=Marine.= A soldier serving on ship-board; a sea-soldier; one of a body\r\nof troops trained to do duty on vessels of war.\r\n\r\n=Marine Fortification.= This kind of fortification differs from land\r\nfortification in that the approaches of the enemy which are to be\r\nresisted take place on the level of the sea, so that he can come near\r\nwithout having to overcome the dangerous slope of the glacis. The combat\r\nis simply one between two powerful batteries, and the question to be\r\ndecided is, whether the ship or the fort will first be placed _hors de\r\ncombat_; the ship having ordinarily the largest number of guns, while\r\nthe fort has more solid battlements, and its fewer guns of great caliber\r\ncan be fired with a steadiness unattainable on so shifting a base as the\r\nocean. Under these circumstances, the less relief a sea-fortress has the\r\nbetter, the less likely is it to be hit from shipping. Its walls are\r\nusually built perpendicular, or nearly so. The magazines and quarters\r\nfor the men are bomb-proof, as also are the casemates, from which the\r\nguns are usually fired, although sometimes, as in the martello tower,\r\nthe gun is worked on top of the structure. Sea fortifications may be of\r\nvarious importance, the simplest being the battery consisting of a mere\r\nparapet formed in a cliff or on a hill, and mounted with guns to command\r\nthe sea; these are generally built in such concealed situations, that\r\nit is hoped the hostile ship will not perceive them until they actually\r\nopen fire. These are numerous all around the British coast. Next greater\r\nin importance is the martello tower (which see). More powerful still are\r\nthe breach-forts, such as those which on either shore defend the\r\nentrance to Portsmouth harbor, England. These are constructed of the\r\nmost solid masonry, and armed with guns of the heaviest caliber,\r\nsweeping the very surface of the sea so as to strike an approaching ship\r\nbetween wind and water. The guns are usually in bomb-proof casemates,\r\nand the fort is often defended on the land side, if the coast be level;\r\nif, however, higher ground be behind, this would be useless, and then\r\nthe sea-front alone is defensible. Most terrible of all sea-forts,\r\nhowever, are the completely isolated forts with perpendicular faces and\r\ntwo and three tiers of heavy guns. Such are the tremendous batteries\r\nwhich render Cronstadt almost unapproachable, and by which Spithead and\r\nPlymouth Sound, England, are now being fortified. These forts are\r\ngenerally large, with all the requisites for a garrison to maintain\r\nitself; against them wooden ships stand no chance, and in the American\r\ncivil war, Fort Sumter, at Charleston, has shown itself no mean\r\nantagonist for ironsides. In the new forts, as Spithead, etc., iron is\r\nto be employed as the facing, in plates of such vast thickness and\r\nweight that it is supposed no ship can ever possess any comparable\r\npower; and as they are to be armed with guns the smallest of which will\r\nprobably be 300-pounders, it is expected that they will be able to\r\ndestroy any fleet that could be sent against them. At the present day,\r\nthe value of sea fortifications is disputed, as iron-plated vessels may\r\npass them with impunity, unless the artillery in the fort be so heavy as\r\nto destroy the armor of the ships. In the long run, however, it is\r\napparent that the fort can command the greater power; for its armor may\r\nbe of any thickness, while that of the ship must be limited by her\r\nfloating powers, and on the other hand, the limit to the size of\r\nartillery must be sooner reached in a ship than in a solid and\r\nstationary fortress.\r\n\r\n=Marines, Corps of.= In the U. S. service is a body of troops who serve\r\nat the different naval stations, and on board ships of war. The men are\r\ndrilled in all respects as infantry, and therefore, when on shore, are\r\nordinary land forces. On board ship, their ordinary functions are as\r\nsharpshooters in time of action, and at other times to furnish sentries\r\nfor guarding the stores, gangways, etc.; and they are useful as\r\nexercising a good control over the less rigidly disciplined sailors.\r\nThey are also instructed as guns’ crews, and when not on guard, are\r\nsubject to the orders of the naval officers in the same manner as the\r\nseamen. The corps was first established in the United States in 1775,\r\nand was permanently organized by act of Congress in 1798. By this act,\r\nmarines were made liable to do duty at the call of the President in any\r\nof the forts or posts of the United States, and were placed on the\r\nfooting of infantry soldiers, as far as regards pay and allowances. When\r\ndetached for duty with the army, marines are subject to the Articles of\r\nWar; at all other times they are subject to the laws and regulations for\r\nthe government of the navy. The corps numbers about 2000 men commanded\r\nby a colonel. The corps has undergone many changes in respect of\r\nnumbers, equipment, drill, and methods of recruiting since its\r\norganization, and was never in a better state of discipline and\r\nefficiency than now. No man is enlisted who is unable to read and write,\r\nunder 5 feet 6 inches high, or over thirty-five years of age. It is\r\norganized into battalions for duty on shore, and into “guards,” or\r\ncompanies, for service afloat, each having its proper complement of\r\nofficers, non-commissioned officers, musicians, and privates, and is\r\nconsidered an indispensable auxiliary to the navy. Civilians between\r\ntwenty and twenty-five years of age are eligible at present to\r\nappointment as lieutenants in line of promotion, and are stationed at\r\nthe head-quarters of the corps in Washington for their preliminary\r\ninstruction. In the British service, besides the infantry, there is a\r\ndivision of marine artillery. In rank, marine officers correspond with\r\narmy officers of the same grade, according to seniority; they are\r\nusually appointed from civil life.\r\n\r\n=Maritime.= Bordering on, or situated near, the ocean; connected with\r\nthe sea by site, interest, or power.\r\n\r\n=Mark.= That toward which a missile is directed; a thing aimed at; what\r\none seeks to hit or reach.\r\n\r\n=Mark, St., Knights of.= An order of knighthood which formerly existed\r\nin the republic of Venice, under the protection of St. Mark the\r\nEvangelist.\r\n\r\n=Mark Time.= To mark time is to move each leg alternately in quick or\r\nordinary time, without gaining ground. This is frequently practiced when\r\na front file or column has opened too much, in order to afford the rear\r\nan opportunity of getting up; and sometimes to let the head of a column\r\ndisengage itself, or a body of troops file by, etc.\r\n\r\n=Marker.= The soldier who forms the pivot of a wheeling column, or marks\r\nthe direction of an alignment. Also, the one who records the number of\r\nhits and misses made by soldiers at target practice.\r\n\r\n=Marks, Inspection.= Are certain marks cut on cannon to show the number\r\nof the gun, the name of the founder, name of inspector, weight of the\r\npiece, etc. Condemned shot are also marked. See INSPECTION OF\r\nPROJECTILES.\r\n\r\n=Marksman.= One who is skillful to hit a mark; one who shoots well.\r\n\r\n=Marksmanship.= The skill of a marksman.\r\n\r\n=Marlins.= Are tarred white skeins or long wreaths or lines of untwisted\r\nhemp, dipped in pitch or tar, with which cables and other ropes are\r\nwrapped round, to prevent their fretting and rubbing in the blocks or\r\npulleys through which they pass. The same serves in artillery upon ropes\r\nused for rigging gins, usually put up in small parcels called skeins.\r\n\r\n=Maron= (_Fr._). A piece of brass or copper, about the size of a crown,\r\non which the hours for going the rounds were marked in the old French\r\nservice. Several of these were put into a small bag, and deposited in\r\nthe hands of the major of the regiment, out of which they were regularly\r\ndrawn by the sergeants of companies, for the officers belonging to them.\r\nThe hours and half hours were engraved on each maron. These pieces were\r\nnumbered one, two, etc., to correspond with the several periods of the\r\nnight; so that the officer, for instance, who was to go to the 10\r\no’clock rounds, had as many marons marked ten as there were posts or\r\nguard-houses which he was directed to visit. Thus on reaching the first,\r\nafter having given the _mot_, or watch-word, to the corporal, he\r\ndelivers into his hands the maron marked one. These marons being pierced\r\nin the middle are successively strung by the different corporals upon a\r\npiece of wire, from which they slide into a box called _boite aux\r\nrondes_, or box belonging to the rounds. This box is carried next\r\nmorning to the major, who keeps the key; and who on opening it can\r\neasily ascertain whether the rounds have been regularly gone by counting\r\nthe different marons, and seeing them successively strung.\r\n\r\n=Maroons.= A name given to runaway negroes in Jamaica. When the island\r\nwas conquered from the Spaniards a number of their negroes fled to the\r\nhills and became very troublesome to the colonists. A war of eight\r\nyears’ duration ensued, when the Maroons capitulated on being permitted\r\nto retain their free settlements, about 1730. In 1795 they again took\r\narms, but they were speedily suppressed.\r\n\r\n=Marquee=, or =Markee=. An outer fly, or roof-cloth of a tent; also, a\r\nlarge field-tent.\r\n\r\n=Marquis=, or =Marquess=. The degree of nobility which in the peerage of\r\nEngland ranks next to a duke. Marquises were originally commanders on\r\nthe borders or frontiers of countries, or on the sea-coast, which they\r\nwere bound to protect. In England, the title of marquis was used in this\r\nsense as early as the reign of Henry III., when there were marquises or\r\nlords-marchers of the borders of Scotland and Wales; and the foreign\r\nequivalent of _markgraf_ was common on the continent.\r\n\r\n=Marrons.= In pyrotechny, are small paper shells filled with grained\r\npowder and primed with short pieces of quick-match. They form part of\r\nthe _decorations_ of signal-rockets.\r\n\r\n=Marrucini.= A brave and warlike people in Italy of the Sabellian race,\r\noccupying a narrow slip of country along the right bank of the river\r\nAtermus. Along with the Marsi, Peligni, and other Sabellian tribes, they\r\nfought against Rome; and, together with them, they submitted to the\r\nRomans, 304 B.C., and concluded a peace with the republic.\r\n\r\n=Marsacii.= A people in Gallia Belgica, on one of the islands formed by\r\nthe Rhine, which first became known to the Romans through the war with\r\nCivilis.\r\n\r\n=Marsaglia.= Near Turin, in Italy. A battle took place here on September\r\n24, 1693, in which Catinat defeated Prince Eugène and the Duke of Savoy.\r\nThis battle and place are memorable for being the first at which\r\nbayonets were used at the ends of muskets, and to this the French owed\r\nthe victory.\r\n\r\n=Marsala= (Arab. _Marsa Alla_, “the port of God”). A maritime town of\r\nSicily, in the province of Trapani, about 19 miles south-southwest of\r\nthe port of Trapani. Marsala has recently acquired historic interest as\r\nthe point where Garibaldi, eluding the vigilance of the Neapolitan\r\nfleet, landed with his heroic _thousand_, and began the romantic\r\ncampaign which terminated the kingdom of the two Sicilies so\r\nignominiously.\r\n\r\n=Marseillaise.= The name by which the grand song of the first French\r\nrevolution is known. The circumstances which led to its composition are\r\nas follows. In the beginning of 1792, when a column of volunteers was\r\nabout to leave Strasburg, the mayor of the city, who gave a banquet on\r\nthe occasion, asked an officer of artillery, named Rouget de Lisle, to\r\ncompose a song in their honor. His request was complied with, and the\r\nresult was the Marseillaise,--both verse and music being the work of one\r\nnight. De Lisle entitled the piece “_Chant de Guerre de l’Armée du\r\nRhin_.” Next day it was sung with that rapturous enthusiasm that only\r\nFrenchmen can exhibit, and instead of 600 volunteers, 1000 marched out\r\nof Strasburg. Soon from the whole army of the North resounded the\r\nthrilling and fiery words, _Aux armes! Aux armes!_ Nevertheless, the\r\nsong was still unknown in Paris, and was first introduced there by\r\nBarbaroux, when he summoned the youth of Marseilles to the capital in\r\nJuly, 1792. It was received with transports by the Parisians,\r\nwho--ignorant of its real authorship--named it “_Hymne des\r\nMarseillais_,” which name it has borne ever since.\r\n\r\n=Marseilles= (anc. _Massilia_). A city in the south of France, the\r\ncapital of the department of the Mouths-of-the-Rhone, situated on the\r\nMediterranean Sea. It was founded by the Phocæans about 600 B.C.; was an\r\nally of Rome, 218 B.C.; taken by Julius Cæsar after a long siege, 49\r\nB.C.; by Euric the Visigoth, 470; sacked by the Saracens, 839; united to\r\nthe crown of France, 1482. Marseilles opposed the revolutionary\r\ngovernment, and was reduced August 23, 1793.\r\n\r\n=Marshal= (Fr. _maréchal_). A term which originally meant a groom or\r\nmanager of the horse, though eventually the king’s marshal became one of\r\nthe principal officers of state in England. The royal farrier rose in\r\ndignity with the increasing importance of the _chevalerie_, till he\r\nbecame conjointly with the constable the judge in the _Curiæ Martiales_,\r\nor courts of chivalry. When the king headed his army in feudal times,\r\nthe assembled troops were inspected by the constable and marshal, who\r\nfixed the spot for the encampment of each noble, and examined the\r\nnumber, arms, and condition of his retainers. With these duties was\r\nnaturally combined the regulation of all matters connected with armorial\r\nbearing standards, and ensigns. The constable’s functions were virtually\r\nabolished in the time of Henry VIII., and the marshal became thenceforth\r\nthe sole judge in questions of honor and arms. (See EARL MARSHAL.) In\r\nFrance, the highest military officer is called a marshal, a dignity\r\nwhich originated early in the 13th century. There was at first only one\r\n_maréchal de France_, and there were but two till the time of James I.\r\nTheir number afterwards became unlimited. Originally, the marshal was\r\nthe esquire of the king, and commanded the vanguard in war; in later\r\ntimes, the command became supreme, and the rank of the highest military\r\nimportance. See FIELD-MARSHAL.\r\n\r\n=Marshal.= To dispose in order; to arrange in a suitable manner; as, to\r\nmarshal troops or an army.\r\n\r\n=Marshal of Scotland, Earl.= An officer who had command of the cavalry\r\nunder the constable. This office was held by the family of Keith, but\r\nforfeited by rebellion in 1715.\r\n\r\n=Marshal, Provost-.= See PROVOST-MARSHAL.\r\n\r\n=Marshaler= (written also _marshaller_). One who marshals.\r\n\r\n=Marshaling of Arms.= In heraldry, is the combining of different coats\r\nof arms in one escutcheon, for the purpose of indicating family alliance\r\nor office.\r\n\r\n=Marsi.= A brave people of Southern Italy, who, after several contests,\r\nyielded to the Romans about 301 B.C. During the civil wars they and\r\ntheir allies rebelled, having demanded and been refused the rights of\r\nRoman citizenship, 91 B.C. After many successes and reverses, they sued\r\nfor and obtained peace and the rights they required, 87 B.C. The Marsi\r\nbeing _Socii_ of the Romans, this was called the Social war.\r\n\r\n=Marsilly Carriage.= A naval gun-carriage having but one set of trucks,\r\none of the transoms resting directly on the deck. It is used in the\r\nU. S. navy for mounting the 9-inch Dahlgren in broadside.\r\n\r\n=Marston Moor.= Near the city of York, England. The Scots and\r\nParliamentary army were besieging York, when Prince Rupert, joined by\r\nthe Marquis of Newcastle, determined to raise the siege. Both sides drew\r\nup on Marston Moor, July 2, 1644, and the contest was long undecided.\r\nRupert, commanding the right wing of the royalists, was opposed by\r\nOliver Cromwell, at the head of troops disciplined by himself. Cromwell\r\nwas victorious; he drove his opponents off the field, followed the\r\nvanquished, returned to a second engagement and a second victory. The\r\nprince’s artillery was taken and the royalists never recovered the blow.\r\n\r\n=Marta=, or =Martha Santa=. A town of New Granada, South America,\r\ncapital of a province of the same name in the department of Magdalena.\r\nIt was repeatedly sacked by pirates during the 16th and 17th centuries;\r\nand in 1672 was completely pillaged by a French and an English vessel.\r\nIt suffered much from the attacks of the Indians during the\r\nrevolutionary war, and does not appear to have regained its former\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n=Marteau d’Armes= (_Fr._). An offensive weapon, so called from its\r\nresemblance to a hammer.\r\n\r\n=Martel-de-fer.= A hammer and pick conjoined, used by horse-soldiers in\r\nthe Middle Ages to break and destroy armor.\r\n\r\n=Martello Towers.= Are round towers for coast defense, about 40 feet\r\nhigh, built most solidly, and situated on the beach. They occur in\r\nseveral places round the coast of Great Britain; but principally\r\nopposite to the French coast, along the southern shore of Kent and\r\nSussex, where, for many miles, they are within easy range of each other.\r\nThey were mostly erected during the French war, as a defense against\r\ninvasion. Each had walls of 5¹⁄₂ feet thickness and was supposed to be\r\nbomb-proof. The base formed the magazine; above were two rooms for the\r\ngarrison, and over the upper of these the flat roof, with a 4¹⁄₂ feet\r\nbrick parapet all round. On this roof a heavy swivel-gun was to be\r\nplaced to command shipping, while howitzers on each side were to form a\r\nflanking defense in connection with the neighboring towers. Although the\r\ncost of these little forts was very great, they are generally considered\r\nto have been a failure. The name is said to be taken from Italian towers\r\nbuilt near the sea, during the period when piracy was common in the\r\nMediterranean, for the purpose of keeping watch and giving warning if a\r\npirate-ship was seen approaching. This warning was given by striking on\r\na bell with a hammer (Ital. _martello_), and hence these towers were\r\ncalled _tarri da martello_.\r\n\r\n=Martial.= Pertaining to war; suited to war; military, as, martial\r\nmusic; a martial appearance; given to war; warlike; brave, as, a martial\r\nnation or people; belonging to war, or to an army and navy; opposed to\r\ncivil; as, martial law; a court-martial.\r\n\r\n=Martial Law.= An arbitrary law, proceeding directly from the military\r\npower, and having no immediate constitutional or legislative sanction.\r\nWhen it is imposed upon any specified district, all the inhabitants, and\r\nall their actions, are brought within its dominion. It is founded on\r\nparamount necessity, extends to matters of civil as well as of criminal\r\njurisdiction, and is proclaimed only in times of war, insurrection,\r\nrebellion, or other great emergency. It is so far distinct from military\r\nlaw, which affects only the troops and forces. Martial law may, in fact,\r\nbe termed a subjection to the Articles of War. In a hostile country it\r\nconsists in the suspension, by the occupying military authority, of the\r\ncivil and criminal law, and of the domestic administration and\r\ngovernment in the occupied place or territory, and in the substitution\r\nof military rule and force for the same, as well as in the dictation of\r\ngeneral laws, as far as military necessity requires this suspension,\r\nsubstitution, or dictation, and is simply military authority exercised\r\nin accordance with the laws and usages of war. Military oppression is\r\nnot martial law, it is the abuse of the power which that law confers. As\r\nmartial law is executed by military force, it is incumbent upon those\r\nwho administer it to be strictly guided by the principles of justice,\r\nhonor, and humanity,--virtues adorning a soldier even more than other\r\nmen, for the very reason that he possesses the power or his arms against\r\nthe unarmed. Martial law affects chiefly the police and collection of\r\npublic revenue and taxes, whether imposed by the expelled government or\r\nby the invader, and refers mainly to the support and efficiency of the\r\narmy, its safety, and the safety of its operations.\r\n\r\n=Martialize.= To render warlike; as, to martialize a people.\r\n\r\n=Martinet= (so called from an officer of that name in the French army\r\nunder Louis XIV.). A strict disciplinarian; one who lays stress on the\r\nrigid adherence to the details of discipline, or to forms and fixed\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n=Martinetism.= Rigid adherence to discipline.\r\n\r\n=Martini-Henry Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Martinique.= An island in the West Indies, the most northern and one of\r\nthe largest of the Windward group. It was taken from the French by the\r\nBritish in February, 1762; restored to France at the peace of the\r\nfollowing year; again taken March 16, 1794; restored at the peace of\r\nAmiens in 1802; and was again captured February 23, 1809. It reverted to\r\nits French masters in 1815.\r\n\r\n=Martin’s Shell.= A hollow spherical projectile lined with loam and\r\nfilled with molten iron,--used for incendiary purposes.\r\n\r\n=Martlet.= In heraldry, a bird resembling a swallow, with long wings,\r\nvery short beak and thighs, and no visible legs, borne on the shield as\r\na mark of cadency by the fourth son.\r\n\r\n=Maryland.= One of the thirteen original States of the United States,\r\nand one of the Central Atlantic States. Maryland was first settled in\r\n1631, by a party from Virginia, and in 1632 by a colony of Roman\r\nCatholic gentry from England, under a grant to the second Lord\r\nBaltimore, when it received its present name in honor of the English\r\nqueen, Henrietta Maria. From 1642 to 1645 the Virginian and English\r\ncolonies were at perpetual warfare, and the governor of the English\r\ncolony, Philip Calvert, was obliged to leave, but in 1646 he returned,\r\nthe rebellion having ended. Maryland took a prominent part in the two\r\nFrench wars, the Revolution, and the war of 1812-14, when it was twice\r\ninvaded by the British, who were gallantly repulsed from North Point,\r\nnear Baltimore, September 13, 1814, although they had gained a temporary\r\ntriumph a few weeks before at Bladensburg. In the war of 1861-66, its\r\nsympathies were with the South, and the first blood of the war was shed\r\nin Baltimore, several Massachusetts volunteers having been killed on\r\ntheir way to Washington. The State was the scene of several battles\r\nduring the civil war, and suffered greatly from the contending armies.\r\nMaryland was organized as a State in 1776.\r\n\r\n=Masada.= A fortress on the shore of the Dead Sea, built by Jonathan\r\nMaccabæus, and afterwards greatly strengthened by Herod, as a place of\r\nrefuge for himself. It fell into the hands of the Romans after the\r\ncapture of Jerusalem, the garrison having devoted themselves to\r\nself-destruction.\r\n\r\n=Mascara.= A town of Algeria, 48 miles southeast from Oran. The town was\r\ntaken and nearly destroyed by the French in 1835, and occupied a second\r\ntime by Gen. Bugeaud in 1841, since which time a garrison of French\r\ntroops has been constantly maintained there.\r\n\r\n=Mascat=, or =Muscat=. A large seaport of Arabia, standing on a\r\npeninsula on the northeast coast of the province of Oman. In 1507 it was\r\ntaken by Albuquerque. For nearly 150 years after, it continued in the\r\npossession of the Portuguese. About the year 1648, however, it was\r\nretaken by the natives, who have ever since retained it.\r\n\r\n=Mascled Armor.= A kind of armor sometimes worn by the Norman soldiers,\r\ncomposed of small lozenge-shaped plates of metal fastened on a leathern\r\nor quilted under-coat.\r\n\r\n=Mascoutins.= A tribe of Indians of Algonkin stock, who formerly\r\ninhabited the region of the Upper Lakes. They afterwards moved to the\r\nWisconsin River, and subsequently settled on the Ohio. In 1765 they\r\nfought against Col. Croghan on the Wabash River, and attacked Col.\r\nClarke in 1777. Their name is now lost among the numerous petty tribes\r\nthat reside in Kansas.\r\n\r\n=Mask.= A military expression used in several senses. A _masked battery_\r\nis one so constructed with grassy glacis, etc., as to be hidden from the\r\nview of the enemy, until, to his surprise, it suddenly opens fire upon\r\nhim,--on his flank, perhaps. The fire of a battery is masked when some\r\nother work, or body of friendly troops, intervenes in the line of fire,\r\nand precludes the use of the guns. A fortress or an army is masked when\r\na superior force of the enemy holds it in check, while some hostile\r\nevolution is being carried out.\r\n\r\n=Mask.= A wire cage to protect the face in fencing.\r\n\r\n=Mask Wall.= In permanent fortification, is the scarp wall of casemates.\r\n\r\n=Mason and Dixon’s Line.= The line which divides Pennsylvania from\r\nMaryland, running on the parallel of 39° 43′ 26″. The boundary between\r\nthe colonial possessions of the lords Baltimore and of the Penn family\r\nhad been a subject of almost continual dispute from the first settlement\r\nof the country. At length, in 1760, the contending parties having agreed\r\nupon a compromise, appointed commissioners to settle definitively the\r\nlimits between the two territories. Surveyors were employed by both\r\nsides, but their progress appeared rather slow; the proprietors who\r\nresided in England decided to send Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, two\r\ndistinguished mathematicians and astronomers, to complete the work. They\r\narrived in Philadelphia in November, 1763, and by the autumn of 1767 had\r\ncarefully surveyed and marked a line of nearly 250 miles, extending for\r\nthe most part through a dense forest and passing over a number of\r\nmountain ridges. This line, dividing as it does the free State of\r\nPennsylvania from Maryland, which was formerly a slave State, has been\r\noften referred to, in popular language, as the boundary between freedom\r\nand slavery in the United States.\r\n\r\n=Mass.= In _statics_, is the amount of matter contained in a body. In\r\n_dynamics_, is that measure of the matter in a body which determines its\r\nrelation to force. The accepted measure is the weight divided by the\r\nforce of gravity. See FORCE OF GRAVITY.\r\n\r\n=Mass.= A word signifying the concentration of troops; the formation of\r\ntroops in column at less than half distance. To _mass troops_, is to\r\nconcentrate them by this arrangement on a certain point. A column _is\r\nclosed in mass_ when the sub-divisions have less than half distance.\r\n\r\n=Massachusetts.= One of the thirteen original States of the American\r\nUnion, and oldest of the New England States. It was discovered by the\r\nCabots in 1497. In 1614 it was visited by Capt. John Smith. In 1620 the\r\n“Mayflower” sailed from Southampton with 102 Puritan settlers, and\r\nlanded at Plymouth December 22. One half of them died from cold and\r\nhardship the first year. In 1637, the colony suffered from Indian\r\nmassacres; and in King Philip’s war (1675) 12 towns and 600 houses were\r\nburned. The war of the Revolution of 1776 began in Massachusetts with\r\nthe battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill. It adopted the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, 1788.\r\n\r\n=Massachusetts Indians.= A general name given to all the tribes of\r\naborigines inhabiting the country in which the colonies of Plymouth and\r\nMassachusetts Bay were founded. The five principal tribes were the\r\nNausets, Pokanokets, or Wampanoags, Massachusetts, Pennacooks, and\r\nNipmucks. They were nearly all exterminated in King Philip’s war (1675).\r\nAt present about 1500 Indians reside in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n=Massacre.= The killing of human beings by indiscriminate slaughter,\r\nmurder of numbers with cruelty or atrocity, or contrary to the usages of\r\ncivilized people; cold-blooded destruction of life; butchery; carnage.\r\nThe following are among the most remarkable:\r\n\r\n_Before Christ._--Of all the Carthaginians in Sicily, 397; 2000 Tyrians\r\ncrucified and 8000 put to the sword for not surrendering Tyre to\r\nAlexander, 331; 2000 Capuans, friends of Hannibal, by Gracchus, 211;\r\ndreadful slaughter of the Teutones and Ambrones near Aix, by Marius, the\r\nRoman general, 200,000 being left dead on the spot, 102; the Romans\r\nthroughout Asia, women and children not excepted, massacred in one day,\r\nby order of Mithridates, king of Pontus, 88; great number of Roman\r\nsenators massacred by Cinna, Marius, and Sertorius, 87; again, under\r\nSylla and Catiline, his minister of vengeance, 82; at Perusia,\r\nOctavianus Cæsar ordered 300 Roman senators and other persons of\r\ndistinction to be sacrificed to the manes of Julius Cæsar, 40.\r\n\r\n_After Christ._--At the destruction of Jerusalem 1,100,000 Jews are said\r\nto have been put to the sword, 70; the Jews, headed by one Andræ, put to\r\ndeath many Greeks and Romans in and near Cyrene, 115; Cassius, a Roman\r\ngeneral under the emperor M.

Out of these stoppages a\r\nsettled and regular _masse_, or stock-purse, was made up, and at the end\r\nof every month it was paid into the hands of the major or officer\r\nintrusted with the interior management of the corps, and was then\r\nappropriated to defray the expense of clothing the different regiments,\r\nand lodged in the hands of the directors or inspector-general of\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\n=Masse d’Armes= (_Fr._).

It is\r\nusually divided into _pure_, which considers magnitude or quantity\r\nabstractly, without relation to matter; and _mixed_, which treats of\r\nmagnitude as subsisting in material bodies, and is consequently\r\ninterwoven with physical considerations; and to this branch may be\r\nreferred astronomy, geography, hydrography, hydrostatics, mechanics,\r\nfortification, gunnery, mining, and engineering. The knowledge of\r\nmilitary mathematics is applicable to all the operations of war, where\r\neverything consists in proportion, measure, and motion, bringing into\r\nplay the several important sciences already enumerated, a certain\r\nproficiency in most of which is absolutely requisite to the formation of\r\na good and skillful officer.\r\n\r\n=Matras= (_Fr._).

In 429 the Vandal king\r\nGenseric, at the invitation of Count Boniface, crossed the Straits of\r\nGades, and Mauritania, with other African provinces, fell into the hands\r\nof the barbarian conquerors. Belisarius destroyed the kingdom of the\r\nVandals, and Mauritania again became a Roman province under an Eastern\r\nexarch. In 698, when the Arabs made the final conquest of Africa, the\r\nMoors adopted the religion, name, and origin of their conquerors, and\r\nsunk back into their more congenial state of Mohammedan savages.\r\n\r\n=Mauritius=, or =The Isle of France=. An island in the Indian Ocean,\r\nlying about 500 miles east from Madagascar, and forming a colony of\r\nGreat Britain.

Lee, and\r\nthe Federal troops, under Gen. McClellan, in which the former were\r\ncompelled to retreat with great loss. The fight was mainly sustained on\r\nthe Federal side by the brigades of Gens. Reynolds and Seymour, and\r\nlasted about seven hours, during the greater part of which time the\r\nFederal artillery kept up a destructive fire on the enemy as they\r\nessayed to charge the lines, each successive attempt only ending in\r\nrenewed disaster. Their loss was said to be about 3000, while that of\r\nthe Federals did not exceed 300.\r\n\r\n=Mechlin=, or =Malines=. A town of Belgium, in the province of Antwerp,\r\nsituated on the Dyle.

Medals belong to two\r\nperiods, ancient and modern, separated by a wide interval. To the former\r\nbelong those pieces issued in ancient Rome, known as _medallions_, and\r\nmade of gold, silver, or copper. They are generally supposed to have\r\nbeen struck on occasions similar to those on which medals are coined in\r\nmodern times, on the accession of an emperor, on the achievement of an\r\nimportant victory, or as specimens of workmanship. Modern medals date\r\nfrom the 14th century, but few were struck prior to the 15th. In more\r\nrecent times, it has become customary to confer medals as marks of\r\ndistinction for eminent worth or noble conduct, but more particularly\r\nfor naval or military services. Such medals of honor are seldom of\r\ngreat intrinsic value, their worth depending on the associations\r\nconnected with them. During the Revolutionary war Congress conferred\r\nthese marks of honor on several military and naval heroes, who\r\ndistinguished themselves by their valor or achievements during that\r\neventful period. In the U. S. service, at present, bronze medals of\r\nhonor are conferred on enlisted men in the army, navy, and marine corps\r\nfor gallantry in action, or extraordinary heroism in the line of their\r\nduties. In the English military service, similar medals are granted.\r\nThey are generally of silver, and have ribbons attached, with clasps or\r\nsmall bars, each of which bears the name of a particular engagement.\r\nGood-service medals of silver are also distributed among meritorious\r\nsoldiers, sailors, and marines.\r\n\r\n=Medals of Honor.= See MEDALS.\r\n\r\n=Medeah=, or =Medeyah=. A fortified town of Algeria, 40 miles southwest\r\nfrom Algiers. This town was taken by the French in 1820.\r\n\r\n=Media.= In ancient times, the name of the northwestern part of Iran,\r\nwhich was bounded by the Caspian Sea on the north, Persia on the south,\r\nParthia on the east, and Assyria on the west. The Medians were in\r\nlanguage, religion, and manners very nearly allied to the Persians.\r\nAfter they had shaken off the yoke of the Assyrians, their tribes united\r\nabout 708 B.C., chose Dejoces for their chief, and made Ecbatana their\r\ncapital. His son Phraortes, or Arphaxad, subdued the Persians. Cyaxares,\r\nthe son of Phraortes, in alliance with Nabopolassar, king of Babylon,\r\noverthrew the Assyrian empire about 604 B.C., spread the terror of his\r\narms as far as Egypt and the farthest bounds of Asia Minor, and\r\nvanquished the brigand hordes of Scythia, who had carried their ravages\r\nas far as Syria. He was succeeded by his son Astyage, who was deposed\r\n(560 B.C.) by his own grandson Cyrus, king of Persia; and from this time\r\nthe two nations are spoken of as one people. After the death of\r\nAlexander the Great (324 B.C.), the northwest portion of Media became a\r\nseparate kingdom, and existed till the time of Augustus; the other\r\nportion, under the name of _Great Media_, forming a part of the Syrian\r\nmonarchy. Media was on several occasions separated from Persia. In 152\r\nB.C., Mithridates I. took Great Media from the Syrians, and annexed it\r\nto the Parthian empire, and about 36 B.C., it had a king of its own,\r\nnamed Artavasdes, against whom Mark Antony made war. Under the Sassanian\r\ndynasty, the whole of Media was united to Persia. It became, during the\r\n14th and 15th centuries, the stronghold of the Turkoman tribes. In early\r\ntimes the Medes were a warlike race, and were distinguished for their\r\nskill with the bow. They were also celebrated for their horsemanship,\r\nand it was from them that the Persians adopted this and other favorite\r\nexercises and acquirements. In subsequent times, they appear to have\r\nbecome effeminated by luxury.\r\n\r\n=Mediator.= Any state or power which interferes to adjust a quarrel\r\nbetween any two or more powers, is called a mediator.\r\n\r\n=Medical Department.= This department of an army, next to the\r\ncommissariat, is the most important of all the non-combatant sections.\r\nThe surgical treatment of the wounded in actual fighting, and still more\r\nthe combat with disease engendered by crowding, unhealthy stations, and\r\nthe reckless habits of the soldiery, necessitate a large medical staff;\r\nfor, on an average of the whole army, it is found that the rate of\r\nsickness is at least quadruple that for the civil population. In the\r\nBritish army every battalion, when at home or in the temperate zone, has\r\na surgeon and an assistant-surgeon; when in India or the tropics,\r\nanother assistant-surgeon is added. The medical department is governed\r\nby a director-general, who is a member of the War Office, and has charge\r\nof the surgical, medical, and sanitary arrangements of the army. In the\r\nUnited States every military post has at least one medical officer and\r\nsometimes two, as the nature of the climate or the strength of the\r\ncommand demands, all of whom are under the command of a surgeon-general,\r\nwho ranks as brigadier-general, and is permanently established at\r\nWashington, D. C. He has full control over everything that pertains to\r\nthe medical department of the army. Officers of the medical department\r\nare assistant-surgeons, with the rank of first lieutenants of cavalry\r\nthe first five years of their service thereafter, till promoted to the\r\ngrade of surgeon, when they receive the rank, pay, and emoluments of\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n=Medical Director.= In the U. S. service, an officer who is placed on\r\nduty at the headquarters of a military geographical division or\r\ndepartment, and who, under the supervision of the surgeon-general, has\r\ncontrol of the medical department within the limits of the command in\r\nwhich he is serving.\r\n\r\n=Medical School.= At Netley, England, an institution is established for\r\nthe technical education of medical officers for the British and Indian\r\nmilitary service. Candidates are examined competitively in the ordinary\r\nsubjects of professional knowledge; and, passing satisfactorily through\r\nthat ordeal, are then required to attend for six months at the Military\r\nMedical School. As the school is attached to the Royal Victoria\r\nHospital, which is the great invalid depot for the whole army, the\r\nstudents have ample opportunity of seeing theory exemplified in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n=Medical Staff.= This branch of the British army is under the control of\r\nan experienced officer, stationed at headquarters, under the\r\ndenomination of “director-general.” Immediately under his command are a\r\nnumber of inspectors-general, deputy inspectors-general, and a corps of\r\nstaff-surgeons. The locality of all the officers subordinate to the\r\ndirector-general is determined by the force to which they may be\r\nattached. All the regimental surgeons and assistant-surgeons make their\r\nreports to and consult the staff-officer who is placed in their\r\ndistrict. The director-general is paid from the civil department of the\r\ngovernment. A deputy inspector-general of hospitals must have served\r\nfive years at home, or three years abroad in this rank, before he shall\r\nbe eligible to the highest rank of inspector-general.\r\n\r\nThe _medical board_ consists of three or four medical officers, who may\r\nbe convened by an order through the Secretary of War, for the inspection\r\nof wounded officers, in order to secure them a provision for life,\r\naccording to the regulations regarding pensions, etc.\r\n\r\n=Medicine-chest.= Is composed of all sorts of medicines necessary for a\r\ncampaign, together with such chirurgical instruments as are useful,\r\nfitted up in chests and portable.

In this city Mohammed was\r\nprotected when he fled from Mecca, September 13, 622, others say July\r\n15, 622. (See HEGIRA.) Medina was taken by the Wahabees in 1804; retaken\r\nby the pasha of Egypt in 1818.\r\n\r\n=Medina de Rio Seco.= A town of Spain, 25 miles northwest of Valladolid,\r\non the Seguillo, an affluent of the Douro. Here Bessières defeated the\r\nSpaniards, July 15, 1808.\r\n\r\n=Medjidie.= A Turkish order, instituted in 1852, and conferred after the\r\nCrimean campaign, to a considerable extent, on British officers. It has\r\nfive classes; and the decoration, which differs in size for the\r\ndifferent classes, is a silver sun of seven triple rays, with the device\r\nof the crescent and star alternating with the rays. On a circle of red\r\nenamel, in the centre of the decoration, is the legend in Turkish, whose\r\nsignification is “zeal, honor, and loyalty,” and the date 1268, the\r\nMohammedan year corresponding to 1852; the sultan’s name is inscribed on\r\na gold field within this circle. The first three classes suspend the\r\nbadge round the neck from a red ribbon having green borders, and the\r\nfourth and fifth classes wear it attached to a similar ribbon on the\r\nleft breast. A star, in design closely resembling the badge, is worn on\r\nthe left breast by the first class, and on the right breast by the\r\nsecond class.\r\n\r\n=Meeanee=, or =Miyani=. A village in Sinde, Hindostan, on the Indus, 6\r\nmiles north of Hyderabad, is celebrated as the scene of a great battle\r\nbetween Sir Charles Napier and the ameers of Sinde, February 17, 1843.\r\nSir Charles’s force, composed partly of Europeans, and partly of\r\nnatives, amounted to only 2800 men; that of his foes to 22,000, yet the\r\nlatter were totally routed, losing in killed and wounded 5000, while Sir\r\nCharles’s loss was only 256. The result of this victory was the conquest\r\nand annexation of Sinde.\r\n\r\n=Meer Bukshy.= In the East Indies, a chief paymaster.\r\n\r\n=Meer Tozuk.= In the East Indies, a marshal whose business is to\r\npreserve order in a procession or line of march, and to report\r\nabsentees.\r\n\r\n=Meerut=, =Merut=, or =Mirut=.

The most recent, but the most\r\nimportant of the cities of Arcadia, was founded on the advice of\r\nEpaminondas, after the battle of Leuctra, 371 B.C., and was formed out\r\nof the inhabitants of 38 villages. It was situated near the frontiers of\r\nMessenia, on the river Helisson. It was for a time subject to the\r\nMacedonians, but soon after the death of Alexander the Great, it was\r\ngoverned by a series of native tyrants, the last of whom united the city\r\nto the Achæan League, 234 B.C. It became, in consequence, opposed to\r\nSparta, and was taken by Cleomenes, who destroyed a great part of the\r\ncity, 222. After the battle of Sellasia in the following year it was\r\nrestored by Philopœmen.\r\n\r\n=Megara.= An ancient city of Greece, capital of the territory Megaris,\r\nwas situated 8 stadia (1 mile) from the sea, opposite the island of\r\nSalamis, about 26 miles from Athens and 31 miles from Corinth. In\r\n461-445 B.C. the Athenians had possession of the country, but it\r\nsubsequently became annexed to Attica, and Megaris formed one of the\r\nfour ancient divisions of Attica. It was next conquered by the Dorians,\r\nand was for a time subject to Corinth; but it finally asserted its\r\nindependence, and rapidly became a wealthy and powerful city. The\r\ngovernment was originally an aristocracy, as in most of the Doric\r\ncities; but Theagenes, one of the common people, put himself at the head\r\nof the popular party, and obtained the supreme power about 620 B.C.\r\nTheagenes was afterward expelled, and a democratical form of government\r\nestablished. After the Persian wars, Megara was for some time at war\r\nwith Corinth, and was thus led to form an alliance with Athens, and to\r\nreceive an Athenian garrison in the city, 461; but they were expelled in\r\n441. The city was taken and its walls destroyed by Demetrius\r\nPoliorcetes; it was again taken by the Romans under Q.

Their business is to assist in marking\r\nout the lines of an encampment, etc.; to carry the camp colors to the\r\nfield on days of exercise, and fix them occasionally for the purpose of\r\nenabling the troops to take up correct points in marching, etc. So that\r\nin this respect they frequently, indeed almost always, act as guides, or\r\nwhat the French call _jalonneurs_. They are likewise employed in the\r\ntrenches, and in all fatigue duties.\r\n\r\n=Menace.= A hostile threat. Menacing words used in the presence of a\r\ncourt-martial are punishable in accordance with Article of War 86.

Their\r\nhorrid practice of sacrificing their captives, and the opposition he met\r\nwith so incensed the Roman general, that he gave the Britons no quarter,\r\nthrowing all that escaped from that battle into fires which they had\r\nprepared for the destruction of himself and his army in 61.\r\n\r\n=Menapii.= A powerful people in the north of Gallia Belgica, who\r\noriginally dwelt on both banks of the Rhine, but were afterwards driven\r\nout of their possessions on the right bank by the Usipetes and\r\nTenchteri, and inhabited only the left bank near its mouth, and west of\r\nthe Mosa.\r\n\r\n=Mendavia.= A town of Spain, province of Navarre, 37 miles southwest\r\nfrom Pamplona.

Here Garibaldi and his\r\nvolunteers, numbering between 3000 and 4000, after having intrenched his\r\npositions at Monterotondo and Mentana on their march towards Tivoli, on\r\nNovember 3, 1867, were totally defeated by the papal and French troops,\r\nunder Gens. Kanzler and Polhès, after a severe conflict, in which Gen.\r\nFailly said “the Chassepot rifles did wonders.” There were about 5000\r\nmen on each side, but the Garibaldians were very badly armed. The loss\r\nof the papal and French troops was about 200 killed and wounded; that\r\nof Garibaldi about 800. Garibaldi crossed the Italian frontier, and was\r\narrested at Correse, and eventually sent to Caprera.\r\n\r\n=Mentonniere= (_Fr._). Chin-piece; chin-strap; chin-piece of a helmet is\r\nso called.\r\n\r\n=Mentz= (Ger. _Mainz_, Fr. _Mayence_, anc. _Moguntiacum_).

Next year it\r\nwas taken by the Austrians. By the peace of Lunéville, concluded in\r\n1801, it was formally ceded to France, and in 1815 it was assigned to\r\nHesse-Darmstadt. The town is strongly fortified, and is one of the\r\nstrongest places in Europe, serving as a defense for Germany on the side\r\nof France. On the other side of the Rhine stands the suburb of Castel,\r\nwhich is also fortified.\r\n\r\n=Mequinenza.= A town and port of Spain, on the Ebro, in the province of\r\nHuesca, Aragon, 64 miles southeast from Huesca. It is defended by a\r\nfortress, which was taken by the French in 1810.\r\n\r\n=Mercara.= A town and fortress in the south of India. It was built by\r\nHyder Ali in 1773, after he had conquered the country. Tippoo Sahib gave\r\nit up to the rajah of Coorg in 1792.

Girard, after a\r\nsevere engagement, October 28, 1811. The British took Merida from the\r\nFrench in 1812, Gen. Hill leading the combined forces of English and\r\nSpanish troops.\r\n\r\n=Merionethshire.= The most southern county of North Wales, situated at\r\nthe middle of the Welsh coast. Here Owen Gwynedd defeated Henry II., and\r\nbrave Glyndwr rose in arms at the call of friendship and patriotism to\r\nresist the usurper of the throne of gentle Henry, and the enslaver of\r\nhis loved Wales. Tradition and records tell of bloody deeds done here in\r\nthose and later days by freebooters, daring and cruel.\r\n\r\n=Merit.= To earn by active service, or by any valuable performance; to\r\nhave a right to claim as reward; to deserve.

Also, the projection on the top\r\nof a crenellated wall.\r\n\r\n=Merovingians.= The first Frankish dynasty in Gaul. The name is derived\r\nfrom Merwig, or Merovæus, who ruled about the middle of the 5th century,\r\nhaving united a few tribes under his sway. His grandson, Clovis, or\r\nClodwig, greatly extended his dominions, and on his death divided his\r\nkingdom among his four sons, one of whom, Chlotar, or Chlotaire I.,\r\nreunited them under his own sway in 558. On his death, in 561, the\r\nkingdom was again divided into four parts,--Aquitaine, Burgundy,\r\nNeustria, and Austrasia. His grandson, Clotaire II., again united them\r\nin 613; but after his death, in 628, two kingdoms, Neustria and\r\nAustrasia, were formed, in both of which the Merovingian kings retained\r\na merely nominal power, the real power having passed into the hands of\r\nthe mayors of the palace. The dynasty of the Merovingians terminated\r\nwith the deposition of Childeric IV., in 752, and gave place to that of\r\nthe Carlovingians.\r\n\r\n=Merseburg.= A town of Prussian Saxony, capital of a circle of the same\r\nname, on the Saale. It was near this town that the emperor Henry the\r\nFowler gained his famous victory over the Hungarians in 934. Rudolf of\r\nSwabia was here defeated and slain by Henry IV. in 1080.\r\n\r\n=Mesolonghi.= See MISSOLONGHI.\r\n\r\n=Mess.= The law is silent with regard to messes in the army. Executive\r\nregulations have been made on the subject, but without law it is\r\nimpossible to put messes on a proper footing. In England, an allowance\r\nis granted by the sovereign in aid of the expense of officers’ messes;\r\nand every officer on appointment to a corps subscribes one month’s pay\r\nto the mess-fund. All the officers of the corps mess together. (See\r\nGUARD MESS.) In France, the several grades mess separately; lieutenants\r\nand sub-lieutenants forming two tables, captains another, and\r\nfield-officers of different grades generally eating separately also.\r\nGenerals and colonels of the French service receive an allowance for\r\ntable expenses, not sufficient to keep open house, but enough to enable\r\nthem to entertain guests. In the British navy there are generally three\r\nmesses, namely, the ward-room mess, the gun-room mess, and the\r\nengineers’ mess; in the U. S. navy there are two: the ward-room and\r\nsteerage messes. Enlisted soldiers and seamen, in the army and navy\r\nrespectively, mess together in tables comprising a certain number,\r\naccording to squads or rating; but this has no reference to the\r\ntechnical meaning of messing as applied to officers, and is merely for\r\nthe purpose of economy of fuel and labor in the cooking of their\r\nrations.\r\n\r\n=Message.= Word sent; more especially a dispatch signaled or\r\ntelegraphed.\r\n\r\n=Messenia.= A district in the southwest of the Peloponnesus. At an early\r\nperiod after the Doric conquest, it rose to power and opulence. It is\r\nchiefly noted for its two wars with Sparta, known as the Messenian Wars,\r\nthe first of which lasted from 743 to 724 B.C., and the second from 685\r\nto 668 B.C. In both instances the Athenians were defeated, and in\r\nconsequence, a great part of them emigrated to Sicily, where they took\r\npossession of Zancle, which then received the name of Messana, the\r\npresent Messina (which see).\r\n\r\n=Messina.= A city in the northeast of the island of Sicily, situated on\r\na strait called the Faro di Messina, which separates Italy from\r\nCalabria. It is 9 miles northwest from Reggio, in Calabria. The town is\r\nentirely surrounded with walls and protected by detached forts and a\r\ncitadel, which stands on the neck of the curved promontory that forms\r\nthe harbor. It was seized by the Mamertini about 281 B.C. It belonged\r\nfor many ages to the Roman empire; was taken by the Saracens about 829.\r\nRoger the Norman took it from them by surprise about 1072. It revolted\r\nagainst Charles of Anjou, and was succored by Peter of Aragon, 1282;\r\nrevolted in favor of Louis XIV of France, 1676; the Spaniards punished\r\nit severely, 1678; headquarters of British forces in Sicily prior to\r\n1814; an insurrection took place here which was subdued September 7,\r\n1848. Garibaldi entered Messina after his victory at Malazzo, July\r\n20-21, 1860; the citadel surrendered to Cialdini, March 13, 1861.\r\n\r\n=Mestre de Camp Général= (_Fr._). The next officer in rank, in the old\r\nFrench cavalry service, to the colonel-general. This appointment was\r\ncreated under Henry II. in 1552. _Mestre de camp général des dragoons_,\r\nan appointment which first took place under Louis XIV. in 1684.\r\n\r\n=Metal.= Broken stone, etc., used as a road cover.\r\n\r\n=Metal.= In heraldry, the metals in use are gold and silver, known as\r\n_or_ and _argent_. The field of the escutcheon and the charges which it\r\nbears may be of metal as well as of color. It is a rule of blazon that\r\nmetal should not be placed on metal, or color on color.\r\n\r\n=Metals for Cannon.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR.\r\n\r\n=Metapontum=, or =Metapontium=. A city of Magna Græcia; was situated on\r\nthe Tarentine Gulf, 14 miles from Heraclea, and 24 from Tarentum. The\r\nMetapontines assisted the Athenians in their Sicilian expedition (415\r\nB.C.); they embraced the side of Pyrrhus in his war with the Romans, and\r\nafter its conclusion fell under the Roman yoke. When Hannibal invaded\r\nItaly, the Metapontines after the battle of Cannæ were well disposed to\r\nhim; but, on account of a garrison of Romans, were unable openly to\r\ndesert to him till 212 B.C., when the city was occupied by a\r\nCarthaginian garrison. When Hannibal was compelled to leave Italy he\r\nremoved, along with his own troops, the inhabitants of Metapontum; and\r\nfrom that time the city disappears from history.\r\n\r\n=Metaurus= (now _Metauro_). A river in Central Italy, where Hasdrubal,\r\nbrother of Hannibal, was defeated and slain, 207 B.C., when marching\r\nwith abundant reinforcements for the latter. The Romans were led by\r\nLivius and Claudius Nero, the consuls. The latter commanded the head of\r\nHasdrubal to be thrown into his brother’s camp. This victory saved Rome.\r\n\r\n=Meter=, or =Metre=. The French standard of linear measure, intended to\r\nbe the ten-millionth part of the earth’s quadrant, from the equator to\r\nthe pole. It is equal to 39.370 British, or 39.369 American inches.\r\n\r\n=Methone= (_Modon_). An ancient city of Messenia; was situated on the\r\nsouthwest coast. At the close of the second Messenian war it was given\r\nby the victorious Lacedæmonians to the exiled Nauplians, but was\r\nrestored to its rightful owners by Epaminondas. An unsuccessful attack\r\nwas made upon Methone by the Athenians in 413 B.C. It was made a free\r\ncity by the emperor Trajan.\r\n\r\n=Métier= (_Fr._). Literally means any calling or business. In a military\r\nsense, it is peculiarly applicable to those nations which keep up large\r\nstanding armies, and make war their principal object and pursuit.\r\nChevalier Folard gives the following definition relative to the question\r\nwhich is often discussed on the subject of war, namely, whether war be a\r\ntrade or a science. The English call it a profession. Folard, however,\r\ndistinguishes it in this manner: _La guerre est une métier pour les\r\nignorons, et une science pour les habiles gens_, “war in the\r\napprehension, and under the management of ignorant persons is certainly\r\na mere trade or business, but among able men it becomes an important\r\nbranch of science.”\r\n\r\n=Metric System.= The French system of measures, founded upon the metre.\r\nThe system is decimal, and includes measures of length, area, volume,\r\nand weight.\r\n\r\n=Metulum.= The chief town of the Iapydes in Illyricum; was near the\r\nfrontier of Liburnia, and was situated on two peaks of a steep mountain.\r\nAugustus nearly lost his life in reducing this place, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich fought against him with desperate courage.\r\n\r\n=Metz= (anc. _Divodurum_). A city and fortress of Alsace-Lorraine,\r\nsituated on the Moselle. It was the Roman _Divodurum_, or _Meti_,\r\ncapital of the Mediomatrici, a powerful Gaulish tribe (whose name it\r\ntook at a later date), and of the kingdom of Austrasia, or Metz, in the\r\n6th century; but in 985, Otho II. made it a free imperial city, and\r\nthereafter it was used by the German emperors as a barrier against\r\nFrance. It was besieged by Charles VII. in 1444, and could only preserve\r\nits freedom by the payment of 100,000 crowns. At length Henry II.\r\nobtained possession of it in 1552; and although it was besieged by\r\nCharles V. with an army of 100,000 men, his efforts were completely\r\nbaffled by the skill and energy of the Duke of Guise, and by the courage\r\nand constancy of the townsmen; so that the French continued in\r\npossession of the town till it, along with Toul and Verdun, was formally\r\nsecured to them by the peace of Westphalia in 1648. During the\r\nFranco-German war (1870-71) the emperor Napoleon III. arrived at Metz,\r\nand assumed the chief command, July 28, 1870. After the disastrous\r\ndefeats at Wörth and Forbach, August 6, the whole French army, except\r\nthe corps of MacMahon, De Failly, and Douay, was concentrated here,\r\nAugust 10, 11, and by delay was hemmed in by the Germans. Marshal\r\nBazaine assumed the chief command on August 8, and on August 14 he was\r\nattacked at Courcelles, a little east of Metz. On August 16, Bazaine\r\nadvanced from the fortress, but was attacked by the second army, under\r\ncommand of Prince Frederick Charles, at Vionville, and was compelled to\r\nretreat to Metz. But on August 17, Bazaine massed his troops for a\r\ndecisive conflict, and on August 18 he gave battle at Gravelotte (which\r\nsee), but was compelled to retreat again, and was shut up in the city.\r\nPrince Frederick Charles now surrounded the city, and then began one of\r\nthe greatest sieges of history. After many brilliant sallies Bazaine was\r\ncompelled to surrender, October 27, on account of starvation and\r\nsickness, with an army including 3 marshals, 66 generals, 173,000 men,\r\nincluding the imperial guard, 400 pieces of artillery, 100\r\nmitrailleuses, and 53 eagles and standards; and on October 29 the\r\nGermans entered Metz. All the army that surrendered was compelled to go\r\nto Germany as prisoners of war. In May, 1871, Metz was ceded to the\r\nGerman empire by the peace of Frankfort, and its fortifications greatly\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\n=Meurtrières= (_Fr._), Small loop-holes, sufficiently large to admit the\r\nbarrel of a rifle or musket, through which soldiers may fire, under\r\ncover, against an enemy. They likewise mean the cavities that are made\r\nin the walls of a fortified town or place.\r\n\r\n=Mexico.= A federal republic of North America, next to the United\r\nStates. It was conquered by the Spaniards under Cortez in 1521, and\r\nremained as a Spanish dependency for 300 years; and after a long\r\nstruggle with the mother-country, which commenced in 1810, it shook off\r\nthe Spanish yoke in 1821, and declared its independence. In 1824 the\r\ncountry was declared a federal republic, with a constitution similar to\r\nthat of the United States, and its independence was acknowledged by\r\nSpain in 1836. About this time Texas, which was then the most\r\nnortheastern of the Mexican states, withdrew from the federal league and\r\nbecame an independent republic. The Mexican general, Santa Anna, was\r\nsent to reduce them to subjection, but he was defeated and taken\r\nprisoner by the Texans. In 1845, Texas was annexed to the United States\r\nand admitted into the Union as a State. This led to a war between Mexico\r\nand the United States, by which the former lost all her northern\r\nprovinces, consisting of Utah, California, and New Mexico, which were\r\nceded to the United States in 1848. From this time the history of Mexico\r\nconsists, for the most part, of a long series of insurrections,\r\nrevolutions, and political changes, which followed each other in rapid\r\nsuccession. Santa Anna, who had been driven into exile shortly after his\r\ndisgrace in Texas, was recalled and made dictator in 1853. He was\r\nsucceeded in power by Gens. Carera, Alveraz, Comonfort, and Zulagoa.\r\nWhen the last named was made dictator in 1858, Benito Juarez, the Indian\r\nstatesman, was declared constitutional president by the liberal party; a\r\ncivil war ensued, anarchy and confusion reigned supreme in the country;\r\nbut Juarez, taking advantage of the dissensions between Zulagoa and\r\nMiramon, the leaders of two opposite sections of the party that was\r\nhostile to his government, at last gained the ascendency, and entered\r\nthe capital as president of the Mexican republic in January, 1861. In\r\nthe same year, in consequence of the enormities practiced by Juarez and\r\nhis partisans, and the outrages committed on European merchants resident\r\nin the country, the governments of England, France, and Spain formed a\r\ntriple alliance, and sent an expedition to Mexico to demand satisfaction\r\nfor the injuries inflicted on the subjects of their respective\r\ncountries, and to endeavor to bring about a more settled state of\r\naffairs. Vera Cruz was occupied by the allied forces, and this event was\r\nfollowed soon after by the convention of Soledad, signed in February,\r\n1862, in which the government of Juarez engaged to comply with the\r\nrequisitions of the allies. But the French government disapproved of the\r\nconvention, and although the forces of England and Spain were withdrawn\r\nin compliance with its terms, Napoleon III. determined to advance on the\r\ncapital, with the view of effecting the overthrow of Juarez and placing\r\nthe government of the country on a settled basis. The French troops\r\nwere, however, delayed for some months before Puebla, which capitulated\r\non May 18, 1863, and entered Mexico on the 8th of the following month,\r\namid the acclamations of the people, who had become weary of the\r\nintestine strife that had so long convulsed the land, and which had been\r\nproduced by the jealousy and rivalry of the party leaders who had\r\naspired to the direction of the government. This event was followed by\r\nthe proclamation of the empire and the nomination of Maximilian, the\r\nbrother of the present emperor of Austria, as the first emperor of\r\nMexico under the new régime. The republican leaders were violently\r\nopposed to this measure, and Maximilian by his severity towards them\r\nalienated the affections of many of his original supporters. At length,\r\non the withdrawal of the French troops at the demand of the United\r\nStates, the republicans advanced into Central Mexico. Maximilian with a\r\nMexican force vainly attempted to oppose them, and was captured and shot\r\nat Queretaro, June 19, 1867.\r\n\r\n=Mézières.= An ancient and well-built town of France, the capital of the\r\ndepartment of Ardennes, situated on a peninsula formed by the Meuse. In\r\n1520, the Chevalier Bayard successfully defended this place against\r\n40,000 Spaniards under the Count of Nassau, and in 1815 it held out for\r\ntwo months against the Prussians, but was at length obliged to\r\ncapitulate.\r\n\r\n=Miami Indians.= A tribe of aborigines, of Algonkin stock, who formerly\r\nresided in Ohio and Indiana. In the war of 1812, they fought against the\r\nUnited States as allies of the British. In 1846 the majority of the\r\ntribe removed to Kansas, on a reservation in which State a remnant still\r\nresides.\r\n\r\n=Michigan.= One of the Northern Central States of the United States. It\r\nwas colonized by the French, near Detroit, in the latter half of the\r\n17th century, but, like other French colonies in America, did not\r\nprogress rapidly. At the peace of 1763, it came, with the other French\r\npossessions in North America, under the dominion of Great Britain, and\r\nso remained till the breaking out of the American Revolution, when it\r\npassed to the United States. On the expulsion of the French, the\r\ncelebrated Indian chief Pontiac seized the occasion to rid the country\r\nof the hated whites by a general uprising, and simultaneous attacks on\r\nall the forts of the English on the lakes. Mackinaw was taken by\r\nstratagem, and the garrison mercilessly butchered. Detroit was besieged\r\nfor some months by Pontiac, with 600 Indians; but it held out till the\r\nIndian allies, becoming weary of the siege, retired and left Pontiac no\r\nchoice but to make peace. The British surrendered Detroit to the United\r\nStates in 1796. In 1805, Michigan, which up to that period had been a\r\npart of the Northwest Territory, was formed into a separate government.\r\nIn 1812, it became the scene of some stirring events in the war with\r\nGreat Britain. Lying contiguous to Canada, it was invaded in the very\r\ncommencement of that struggle, and its capital (Detroit) surrendered\r\nAugust 15, 1812, by Gen. Hull, under circumstances which led to his\r\ndisplacement from his command. Previous to this Fort Mackinaw had been\r\ntaken by the enemy. In January, 1813, a cruel massacre by the savages of\r\na party of American prisoners took place at Frenchtown, but soon after,\r\nGen. Harrison drove the enemy out of the Territory of Michigan, and\r\nremoved the seat of war into Canada. Michigan became an independent\r\nmember of the American Confederacy in 1837.

They occupied the greater part of\r\nthe country between the north side of the Arabian Gulf and Arabia Felix\r\nas far as the Plains of Moab. The Midianites were very troublesome\r\nneighbors to the Israelites till Gideon’s victory over them (about 1249\r\nB.C.), after which they gradually disappeared.\r\n\r\n=Mignon= (_Fr._). Picked soldier, now called _élite_.\r\n\r\n=Milan= (_Mediolanum_, capital of the ancient Liguria). A city of Italy,\r\nthe capital of the province of Lombardy, 78 miles northeast from Turin;\r\nis reputed to have been built by the Gauls about 408 B.C. It was\r\nconquered by the Roman consul Marcellus, 222 B.C. It was the seat of\r\ngovernment of the Western empire in 286; plundered by Attila in 452;\r\ntaken by the emperor Frederick I., 1158; it rebelled and was taken by\r\nFrederick and its fortifications destroyed in 1162; but was rebuilt and\r\nfortified in 1169. The Milanese were defeated by the emperor Frederick\r\nII. in 1237; and the city was conquered by Louis XII. of France in 1499.\r\nThe French were expelled by the Spaniards in 1525, and the city annexed\r\nto the crown of Spain in 1540; ceded to Austria, 1714. It was conquered\r\nby the French and Spaniards in 1743; reverted to Austria upon Sicily and\r\nNaples being ceded to Spain in 1748; seized by the French, June 30,\r\n1796, retaken by the Austrians, 1799; regained by the French, May 31,\r\n1800. The Milanese revolted against the Austrians, March 18, 1848, but\r\nsubmitted August 5, 1848. Another insurrection was attempted in 1853,\r\nbut with disastrous results. On June 8, 1859, by the peace of Villa\r\nFranca, Lombardy was annexed to Piedmont, and Victor Emmanuel became\r\nsovereign of Milan.\r\n\r\n=Milazzo= (anc. _Mylæ_). A fortified seaport on the north coast of\r\nSicily, 18 miles west of Messina. It was founded about 700 B.C., and has\r\nbeen the scene of many battles. It was taken by Laches in 427 B.C. It\r\nwas off Mylæ that the Romans, under their consul Duilius, gained their\r\nfirst naval victory over the Carthaginians, and took 50 of their ships,\r\n260 B.C. Here also Agrippa defeated the fleet of Sextus Pompeius, 36\r\nB.C. On July 20, 1860, Garibaldi with 2500 men defeated 7000\r\nNeapolitans, at Milazzo, and compelled the garrison to evacuate the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\n=Mileage.= An allowance for traveling, as so much by the mile;\r\nespecially in the United States, an allowance made to military officers\r\nto defray the expenses of their journeys on duty when not traveling with\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n=Milesian.= A native or inhabitant of Ireland, descended according to\r\nthe legendary history of the country from King Milesius of Spain, whose\r\ntwo sons conquered the island 1300 B.C., and established a new order of\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\n=Milesian.= Pertaining to Ireland, from the tradition that King Milesius\r\nof Spain once conquered the country.\r\n\r\n=Miletus.= A flourishing Greek city of Ionia, in Asia Minor, was\r\nsituated on the north side of the peninsula of Mt. Grion, at the\r\nentrance of the Gulf of Latmus, nearly opposite the mouth of the\r\nMeander. At the time of the Ionian emigration to Asia Minor it existed\r\nas a town, but when the Ionians arrived in Asia, Neleus and a company of\r\nhis followers seized Miletus, put to death all the male inhabitants, who\r\nwere Carians or Leleges, and took the women for their wives. Miletus\r\nbecame for a time a prosperous city under the rule of Lydia and Persia,\r\nbut in 500 B.C. it revolted against Persia, and after repeated defeats\r\nin the field, the city was besieged by land and by sea, and finally\r\ntaken by storm in 494 B.C. The city was plundered and its inhabitants\r\nmassacred, and the survivors were transplanted to a place called Ampe,\r\nnear the mouth of the Tigris. The town itself was given up to the\r\nCarians. Towards the end of the Peloponnesian war, Miletus threw off the\r\nyoke imposed upon her by Athens, and in a battle fought under the very\r\nwalls of the city, the Milesians defeated their opponents; the Athenian\r\nadmiral, Phrynichus, abandoned the enterprise. In 334 B.C., Alexander\r\nthe Great took the city by assault, and destroyed a part of it, but it\r\ncontinued to flourish, until it was destroyed by the Turks and other\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\n=Milford Haven.= A town of Wales, in Pembrokeshire, 6 miles northwest\r\nfrom Pembroke. Here the Earl of Richmond, afterwards Henry VII., landed\r\non his way to encounter Richard III., whom he defeated at Bosworth,\r\n1485.\r\n\r\n=Milice.= An old term for militia.\r\n\r\n=Militancy.= Warfare. This term is obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Militant.= Engaged in warfare; fighting; combating; serving as a\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n=Militantly.= In a militant manner. This term is rarely used.\r\n\r\n=Militar.= Military. This term is obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Militarily.= In a military or soldierly manner.\r\n\r\n=Militarist.= One devoted to military pursuits.\r\n\r\n=Military.= Pertaining to soldiers, to arms, or to war; having to do\r\nwith the affairs of war; as, a military parade or appearance; military\r\ndiscipline. Engaged in the service of soldiers or arms; as, a military\r\nman.

Performed or made by soldiers;\r\nas, a military election.\r\n\r\n=Military.= The whole body of soldiers; soldiery; militia; the army.\r\n\r\n=Military Academies.= The great improvements made in the art of war in\r\nmodern times, in weapons, drill, discipline, etc., has made warfare more\r\nof a science and less of a trial of brute force than formerly, and hence\r\nthe necessity for a body of trained officers capable of moving,\r\ndirecting, and bringing into effective operation all the appliances of\r\nwar with which modern armies are furnished. As this special training\r\ncannot be obtained at ordinary educational establishments, special\r\nschools for the purpose have been established in all civilized\r\ncountries. A few of them are here noted.\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN.--The _Royal Military Academy_, an establishment at\r\nWoolwich, through which must pass all candidates for the artillery and\r\nengineers. It was instituted in 1741, but the present structure was not\r\nerected until 1805. It usually contains about 200 cadets. The age of\r\nadmission is sixteen, and the vacancies are open to public competition.\r\nThe parents or guardians have to make annual payments for the support\r\nof the cadets as long as they remain at the academy, the amount being\r\ngreater for the son of a civilian than of a military or naval officer.\r\nWhen the term of instruction--which comprises the subjects of a thorough\r\ngeneral education, the higher mathematics, fortification, gunnery, and\r\nmilitary duty--is completed, the cadets compete for vacancies in the\r\nengineers and artillery, those who pass the best examination being\r\nallowed a choice of either branch of the service. All who obtain\r\ncommissions in the engineers proceed to Chatham for further instruction\r\nin their professional duties; the artillery cadets at once join the\r\nartillery as lieutenants.\r\n\r\n_Royal Military College, Sandhurst_, is an institution for the training\r\nof candidates for commissions in the cavalry and infantry. The course is\r\nlimited to one year immediately before entering the army, and the\r\nsubjects of instruction confined to the higher mathematics, modern\r\nlanguages, and military science. Entrance is on the nomination of the\r\ncommander-in-chief; and the payment by the cadets’ parents or guardians\r\nvaries according to their circumstances and rank. No payment is made for\r\nwhat are called “Queen’s Cadets,” who must be orphans. Commissions in\r\nthe cavalry and infantry are given to the cadets in the order of merit\r\nat the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe _Staff College_ was founded in 1858, about 2 miles from Sandhurst,\r\nfor the purpose of giving higher instruction to 30 officers aspiring to\r\nappointments on the staff. To be entitled to compete for entrance, an\r\nofficer must have been three years in active service, must have passed\r\nthe qualifying examination for a captaincy, and must have the\r\nrecommendation of his commanding officer. A very strict examination\r\ndecides which among the competitors shall be admitted to the college,\r\none only being eligible from any battalion. The course lasts two years.\r\nAt the end of each year there is an examination; that of the second\r\nfixing the order of the candidates’ choice for staff employment. After\r\npassing the Staff College the officer is attached for duty, for a short\r\nperiod, to each of the arms with which he may not have already served.\r\nHe then becomes eligible for appointment to the staff, as opportunity\r\nmay occur. There are also the Royal School of Military Engineers at\r\nChatham, for the instruction of engineer officers, the Royal Military\r\nSchool at Dublin, and professional schools for officers and enlisted\r\nmen, as the School of Musketry at Hythe, and the School of Gunnery at\r\nShoeburyness.\r\n\r\nFRANCE.--The celebrated _Polytechnic School_ at Paris was established by\r\nthe National Convention, September 28, 1794. By a decree of July 16,\r\n1804, Napoleon placed it under a military régime. No attempt being made\r\nto impart a general education, candidates are required to have a\r\nthorough general knowledge before they are admitted. The preliminary\r\nexamination of candidates for admission comprises mathematics, physics,\r\nchemistry, history, German, etc.; in fact, the candidate to be\r\nsuccessful should have the degree of Bachelor of Science. Admission is\r\nopen to competition; a board of examiners passes through the country\r\nonce every year, and examines all who present themselves, possessing the\r\nrequisite qualifications of age, etc. A list is made out from the\r\nproceedings of the board, and the number of candidates highest in order\r\nof merit for whom there are vacancies admitted. The age of admission is\r\nfrom sixteen to twenty years, or if the candidate is in the army, to\r\ntwenty-five. This school prepares students for various branches of the\r\npublic service, for the staff, engineers, artillery, for the corps of\r\nhydrographical engineers, engineers of roads and bridges and of mines,\r\nthe department of powder and saltpetre, etc. The number of cadets is\r\nusually about 350, and the course of instruction two years. After the\r\nfinal examination the first 30 or 40 candidates usually select civil\r\nemployment under the government, those next in merit choose the\r\nartillery and engineers, and are sent to the School of Application, to\r\npass through a technical course. The remaining students either fail to\r\nqualify, and leave the school, or receive commissions in the line,\r\nsubordinate situations in the government service, civil or colonial, or\r\nthey retire into civil life altogether.\r\n\r\nThe _Special Military School_ at St. Cyr, near Versailles, was\r\nestablished for the instruction of candidates for commissions in cavalry\r\nand infantry. The age of admission is the same as for the Polytechnic\r\nSchool, and pupils are entitled to partial or entire state aid if they\r\nneed it, as are also those of the Polytechnic. The course of instruction\r\nis two years, at the end of which time the more promising students pass\r\nto the Staff School, and thence, after a thorough course, to the\r\n_état-major_ of the army; the remaining students pass as subalterns into\r\nthe cavalry and infantry, selecting the arm of the service in which they\r\ndesire to serve according to the order of merit in which they graduate.\r\nThere are also the School of Application for Engineers and Artillery,\r\nthe School of Application for the Staff, the Cavalry School at Saumur,\r\nfor one year’s instruction to officers of that arm, and the School of\r\nMusketry at Vincennes.\r\n\r\nPRUSSIA.--The Prussian system of military education differs from that of\r\nFrance, in that competition is but sparingly resorted to, the object\r\nbeing to give a good general and professional education to all the\r\nofficers, rather than a specially excellent training to a select few.\r\nFor this purpose there are established seven cadet schools, one senior,\r\nat Berlin, and six junior, situated at Bensburg, Culm, Oranienstein,\r\nPloen, Potsdam, and Wahlstatt. The age of admission to the junior\r\nschools is from ten to eleven years, and the usual course of instruction\r\nis for four years, and two or three at the senior school, followed by\r\nthe finishing term of nine months at a division school, when graduates\r\nare eligible to commissions. Some, however, are sent to the army to earn\r\ntheir commissions as other candidates. Others pass an additional year at\r\nthe senior cadet school, in which case the term at the division school\r\nis dispensed with. After completing their course at the junior schools,\r\nstudents pass to the senior school without examination. They may also be\r\nadmitted to the senior school without passing through the junior grade,\r\nprovided they come up to the required standard of qualification.\r\nAspirants for commissions must enter the ranks, and within six months\r\npass a good examination in general and liberal knowledge if they are not\r\ngraduates of a cadet school. Those who are graduates are not examined.\r\nAfter some further service the candidate goes for nine months to one of\r\nthe division schools, which are eight in number, situated at Anclam,\r\nCassel, Engers, Erfurt, Hanover, Metz, Neisse, and Potsdam. Here he\r\ncompletes his professional education, and if he passes the final\r\nexamination, is eligible for the next vacancy in the line, but cannot be\r\ncommissioned unless the officers of the corps are willing to accept him\r\nas a comrade. Candidates for commissions in the artillery and engineer\r\ncorps, after graduating from the cadet school or passing an examination\r\nfrom the army, must pass nine months at the Artillery and Engineer\r\nSchool, after which they receive a provisional appointment as\r\nsub-lieutenants. Upon graduating, after two more terms of nine months\r\neach, they are commissioned as lieutenants. But the culmination of\r\nPrussian military education is the Staff School, or War Academy, which\r\npresents the highest prizes in the profession, and competition for which\r\nis open to all officers of the army who have had three years’ service,\r\nand can produce testimonials of good conduct, ability, etc., from their\r\nsuperiors. Admission is by competitive examination, usually about 40 of\r\nthe applicants being selected. The course of study lasts three years.\r\nDuring three months of each year the officers are sent to do military\r\nduty with arms of service or corps not their own. Of the 40 who pass\r\nthrough the Staff School each year, 8 or 10 only are sent to the\r\ntopographical department of the staff. There they serve two or three\r\nyears, at the expiration of which time two are selected from the number,\r\nand appointed captains on the staff. The remainder return to their\r\nregiments or corps, sometimes receiving appointments in the division\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.--The Austrian military system of training is very elaborate,\r\nand commences at an early age,--boys intended for military service\r\nbeginning their professional almost contemporaneously with their general\r\neducation. There are schools of various orders for training\r\nnon-commissioned officers and for officers, and senior departments for\r\nimparting more extended instruction to both classes. Candidates for\r\nappointment as non-commissioned officers pass by competition through\r\nthe lower houses, where they remain till eleven years old, the upper\r\nhouses, which detain them till fifteen, and the school companies,\r\nwhence, after actual apprenticeship to service, a few pupils pass to the\r\nacademies as aspirants for commissions, and the others are drafted into\r\nthe service as non-commissioned officers. For the education of officers\r\nthere are four cadet houses, each containing 200 pupils. The boys are\r\npledged to the service by their parents at the age of eleven, after\r\nwhich the state takes charge of them. At fifteen they pass according to\r\nqualification to the academy for the line, the engineer or artillery\r\nacademy, and four years later receive their commissions in the arms of\r\nthe service for which they have graduated. The young officer’s chance of\r\nentering the Staff School--and therefore the staff--depends upon his\r\nplace at the final academic examination.\r\n\r\nThe _Staff School_ consists of 30 pupils selected by competitive\r\nexamination from all arms of the service, 15 entering each year. The\r\ncourse of instruction is two years. To be qualified for admission a\r\ncandidate must have served two years with his regiment, and be over\r\ntwenty-one and under twenty-six years of age. The students receive\r\nappointments in the staff corps according to the order of merit,\r\nimmediately after the final examination, if there are vacancies; if\r\nthere are none, they return to their regiments until vacancies occur. If\r\nthe successful candidate is a second lieutenant, he is promoted to the\r\nrank of first lieutenant; if a first lieutenant, he is promoted captain\r\nafter three years’ service.\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.--Has 22 military colleges for the guards and line, containing\r\nover 7000 cadets, a school of ensigns for the guards, an artillery and\r\nan engineer school, averaging over 8000 military students. There is also\r\nan imperial staff school, into which 20 or 25 officers enter each year\r\nafter examination. The term of instruction is for two years. Upon\r\ngraduation, the most distinguished scholar is at once promoted to the\r\nrank of captain on the staff, and all the graduates are, from time to\r\ntime, as vacancies occur, attached to the staff, but not immediately\r\npromoted in it.\r\n\r\nItaly, Spain, and other powers have also their military academies, but\r\nthose already given may be considered a fair type of all. It need only\r\nbe stated that the educational status of the Italian officers is\r\nconsidered very high.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.--The Military Academy at West Point is the only\r\ngovernment institution in the United States for the military training of\r\ncadets and their preparation for the duties of officers. The necessity\r\nfor such an institution was recognized at an early date in the history\r\nof the country. A committee of Congress which had visited the\r\nContinental army at New York recommended the establishment of a\r\nmilitary academy in their report, October 3, 1776. The subject was\r\nsubsequently brought to the notice of Congress on several occasions, but\r\nwithout result until 1794, when provision was made for the establishment\r\nof 4 battalions of engineers and artillerists, 8 cadets to be attached\r\nto each battalion. The number was increased to 56 in 1798, and provision\r\nmade for procuring books and apparatus for their instruction. By the act\r\nof March 16, 1802, determining the military peace establishment, the\r\nartillerists and engineers were made two distinct corps; 40 cadets were\r\nattached to one regiment of artillery, and 10 to the corps of engineers,\r\nsaid corps to be stationed at West Point, and to constitute a military\r\nacademy. The act also provided that the senior engineer officer present\r\nshould be superintendent of the academy, and authorized the Secretary of\r\nWar to procure the necessary books, apparatus, etc., for the\r\ninstitution. Another act, dated February 28, 1803, authorized the\r\nPresident to appoint teachers of French and drawing. At the expiration\r\nof five years, however, further legislation was deemed necessary, and on\r\nApril 12, 1808, a bill was passed which added 156 members to the corps\r\nof cadets. By the act of April 19, 1812, it was declared that the\r\nMilitary Academy should consist of the corps of engineers, the teachers\r\nof French and drawing already provided for, a professor of natural\r\nphilosophy, a professor of mathematics, and a professor of engineering,\r\nwith an assistant for each professor. Provision was also made for a\r\nchaplain, who was to officiate as professor of geography, physics, and\r\nhistory. The number of cadets was limited to 260; the requirements for\r\nadmission, terms of study and service, and rate of pay and emoluments\r\nwere also prescribed. But the commencement of its great success as an\r\neducational institution, and the reputation which the academy possesses\r\nfor its elevating and disciplinary government, dates from July, 1817,\r\nwhen Brevet Maj. Sylvanus Thayer, of the engineer corps, assumed command\r\nas superintendent. He was an early graduate of the academy, had served\r\nwith distinction in the war of 1812, and having studied in the military\r\nschools of France, had acquired matured views for the government of such\r\nan institution. He organized and perfected a system of management, which\r\nhe carried into successful operation for sixteen years, and which, with\r\nbut little modification, is followed to-day. In 1818 the department of\r\ngeography, history, and ethics was organized, and the chaplain appointed\r\nprofessor; the clerical and secular duties thus combined have ever since\r\nremained inseparable. A professorship of chemistry, mineralogy, and\r\ngeology was created by act of July 5, 1838, and an assistant authorized,\r\n“to be taken from the officers of the line, or cadets.” In May, 1846,\r\nthe teachers of French and drawing were styled professors, and the\r\nappointment of assistants was authorized. In 1857 a professorship of\r\nthe Spanish language was established. By act of Congress approved June\r\n23, 1879, whenever a vacancy occurs in the office of professor of the\r\nFrench or Spanish language, both these offices shall cease, and the\r\nremaining one of the two professors shall be professor of modern\r\nlanguages. A professorship of law has also been established, which is\r\nheld by an officer of the bureau of military justice. The academic staff\r\nconsist of the superintendent; the commandant of cadets, who is\r\ninstructor of artillery, cavalry, and infantry tactics, and is charged\r\nwith the discipline of the cadets, having usually 8 officers detailed\r\nfrom the line of the army as assistants; and of the professors of civil\r\nand military engineering and science of war, of natural and experimental\r\nphilosophy, of mathematics, of history, geography, and ethics\r\n(chaplain), of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology, of drawing, of\r\nFrench, of Spanish, and of law, all of whom have one or more\r\ncommissioned officers as assistants. There are also detailed on duty\r\nseveral officers of the engineer and ordnance corps as instructors in\r\npractical military engineering, military signals and telegraphing, and\r\nin ordnance and gunnery. A sword-master is also employed. The military\r\nstaff consists of an adjutant; a treasurer, quartermaster and\r\ncommissary, of the battalion of cadets; a quartermaster, surgeon, and\r\nassistant surgeon. In 1843 the custom which had prevailed of appointing\r\none cadet from each Congressional district received the sanction of law,\r\nand thus the number was limited to the number of Representatives. But as\r\nthe District of Columbia and the army and navy were not represented, the\r\nPresident was empowered to appoint 1 cadet from the former and 10 cadets\r\n“at large,” the latter to be selected annually from the army or navy, or\r\nany other quarter at his option, without regard to Congressional\r\ndistricts. The age for admission is from seventeen to twenty-two years,\r\nexcept when the candidate has served one year in the war of the\r\nRebellion, in which case he may be admitted up to twenty-four, and the\r\ncourse of instruction is fixed at four years. Candidates must be able to\r\nread and write well, have a good knowledge of grammar, of geography, and\r\nhistory, particularly of the United States, and of arithmetic, including\r\nvulgar and decimal fractions. Examinations are held annually on January\r\n1 and June 1. All newly-appointed cadets must report for examination by\r\nJune 25, and none are examined after September 1, unless detained by\r\nsickness or other unavoidable cause, when they may be examined with the\r\nfourth class on January 1, and if found competent may proceed with that\r\nclass. Each cadet on admission takes the oath of allegiance and binds\r\nhimself to serve the United States for eight years, unless sooner\r\ndischarged. For purposes of instruction, the cadets are divided into\r\nfour classes, the fourth being the junior class, and for matters of\r\ndiscipline the permanent organization is that of a battalion of infantry\r\ncomposed of four companies. During their academic course cadets receive\r\n$500 a year and one ration a day. Upon graduating, the cadets highest in\r\nmerit are usually commissioned as second lieutenants and appointed to\r\nthe engineer corps, those next in order of merit to the artillery, and\r\nthe remainder to the cavalry and infantry. Those for whom no vacancies\r\nexist at graduation are attached to regiments or corps as additional\r\nsecond lieutenants, and promoted second lieutenants as soon as a vacancy\r\noccurs in the arm to which they are attached. By act of Congress\r\napproved June 23, 1879, each member of the graduating classes of 1879-80\r\nmay elect, with the assent of the Secretary of War, to receive the sum\r\nof $750 and mileage to the place of his residence in lieu of an\r\nappointment in the army, except in the event of war, until two years\r\nafter his graduation. There is also an artillery school at Fort Monroe,\r\nVa., for the training of officers and enlisted men. The school is\r\nentirely conducted by commissioned officers, and the course of\r\ninstruction is one year.\r\n\r\n=Military Asylum.= See SOLDIER’S HOME.\r\n\r\n=Military Asylum, Royal.= See ASYLUM, ROYAL MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Military College.= See MILITARY ACADEMIES (SANDHURST).\r\n\r\n=Military Column.= See COLUMN, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Military Discipline.= Next to the forming of troops, military\r\ndiscipline is the first object that presents itself to our notice: it is\r\nthe soul of all armies; and unless it be established among them with\r\ngreat prudence, and supported with unshaken resolution, soldiers become\r\na contemptible rabble, and are more dangerous to the very state that\r\nmaintains them than even its declared enemies. See DISCIPLINE.\r\n\r\n=Military Execution.= The ravaging or destroying of a country or town\r\nthat refuses to pay the contribution inflicted upon them. Also, the\r\npunishment inflicted by the sentence of a court-martial.\r\n\r\n=Military First Principles.= Is the bodily training for a soldier, to\r\nmake him hardy, robust, and capable of preserving health amidst fatigue,\r\nbad weather, and change of climate; to march at such possible pace, for\r\nsuch length of time, and with such burden, as without training he would\r\nnot be able to do.\r\n\r\n=Military Frontier, The.= A crown-land of the Austrian empire, bounded\r\non the north by Croatia, Slavonia, and the Wojwodschaft, on the east by\r\nTransylvania and Wallachia, on the south by Turkey and Dalmatia, and on\r\nthe west by the Adriatic, comprising an area of 12,800 square miles. The\r\nmilitary frontier owes its origin as a crown-land to the necessity of\r\nhaving a permanent body of defenders on the borders during former wars,\r\nand especially during wars with the Turks. In the 15th century the\r\nAustrians had gained from the Turks certain tracts of territory on the\r\nbanks of the Save and Danube. These tracts they colonized, making it,\r\nhowever, a condition that the colonists must render military service\r\nagainst the Turks. The Warasdin frontier originated in the same manner\r\nunder Ferdinand I. In the 17th century the Petrinier frontier, which at\r\na later period received the name of the Banat frontier, was erected. The\r\nmilitary stations along the frontier serve a threefold purpose,--the\r\ndefense of the country, the prevention of smuggling, and the prevention\r\nof the spread of contagious disease into the territories of the Austrian\r\nempire. The inhabitants of this crown-land enjoy peculiar privileges.\r\nTheir immigrant ancestors received only the temporary use of lands\r\nconsigned to them; but in 1850 a law was passed making over the land to\r\nthe occupiers as their own property. This right of property does not\r\nbelong, however, to individuals, but to the family in a united sense.\r\nThe oldest member of a family is intrusted with the management of the\r\nland; his partner ranks equal with him, and they each receive a double\r\nshare of the profits. All who are able to bear arms are sworn to the\r\nservice from their twentieth year. The soldier of the frontier, who is\r\nclothed as well as armed and supplied with ammunition by government,\r\nfinds it his duty not only to watch and protect the frontier, but to\r\npreserve peace and order in the interior, and to go on foreign service\r\nwhen required. Only the smaller portion of the forces of the military\r\nfrontier is retained in readiness for active service, while the\r\nremainder pursue their ordinary employments. To facilitate the\r\naccomplishment of the purposes aimed at by the military frontier, the\r\n_cordon_, a series of guard-houses along the whole frontier, affording\r\naccommodation to from 4 to 8 men, as well as larger ones, accommodating\r\n12 men and a junior officer, has been instituted. Within this line are\r\nthe officers’ posts. Without announcing himself at the posts, no one is\r\nallowed to pass the boundary; and after permission is given the\r\npassenger must remain a longer or shorter time at the quarantine\r\nestablishment, in order that all introduction of disease may be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\n=Military Indications.= Officers should study attentively the customs of\r\ntheir enemy, their hours for dining, commencing their marches, etc., and\r\nthe many indications of intended movements which an enemy may\r\nunwittingly afford. The collection of boats, heavy guns,\r\nscaling-ladders, gabions, etc., at particular places, are indications\r\nthat must always precede the passage of rivers, sieges, etc. If large\r\nmagazines of stores or provisions are collected anywhere, it is clear\r\nthat no retreat is contemplated; if, on the other hand, the parks of\r\nheavy, or spare guns, ammunition, engineer stores, etc., are being sent\r\nto the rear, a retreat is imminent, or being prepared for. The dust\r\nraised by columns is a fair guide in some countries as to the numbers\r\nand composition of the force marching. That raised by cavalry forms a\r\nhigh, light cloud, by infantry, a lower and dense one, by parks and\r\nbaggage, one more dense still. With a good glass you can sometimes learn\r\nfrom the manner in which troops move, and from their dress, whether they\r\nare regulars or militia, or if they belong to any special corps. The\r\nmanner and bearing of people in a hostile country is usually a fair\r\nindication of the public spirit and feeling; if they are gloomy and\r\nanxious, it is an indication of want of confidence in their cause, and\r\nthat their troops are distant; whilst if they are excited and insolent,\r\nit shows that they rely upon assistance near at hand, and anticipate\r\nsuccess from the number and efficiency of their army. In following a\r\nretreating army much can be learned from its trail; if the _débris_ of\r\narms, accoutrements, etc., lie about, there is a want of transport, and\r\nit is a sign of demoralization, according to the extent to which it is\r\nthe case; a large number of graves indicates the existence of disease in\r\nthe enemy’s army. The places where they halted for the night should be\r\ncarefully examined; and all indications carefully noted. Did they\r\nbivouac or pitch tents; was their camp laid out with regularity; were\r\ntheir cooking-places neatly made. Is their track strewn with dead or\r\ndying transport animals; have they plundered the inhabitants or burnt\r\ntheir crops or houses; have they effectually or only partially destroyed\r\nthe bridges, etc. The most insignificant circumstance affords sometimes\r\nwhole pages of information to officers who, having studied the manners\r\nand customs of an enemy, know how to interpret them aright. Officers\r\ncommanding small detached parties sent out on reconnoitring duties may\r\nmany times avoid falling into the hands of strong patrols or detachments\r\nby learning their proximity from their track if crossed anywhere; the\r\nnumber and composition of such detachments may easily be estimated from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n=Military Knights.= See KNIGHTS, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Military Law.= See LAW, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Military Mines.= See MINES, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Military Necessity.= As understood by modern civilized nations,\r\nconsists in the necessity of those measures which are indispensable for\r\nsecuring the ends of war, and which are lawful according to the modern\r\nlaw and usages of war. Military necessity admits of all direct\r\ndestruction of life or limb of _armed_ enemies, and of other persons\r\nwhose destruction is incidentally _unavoidable_ in the armed contests of\r\nwar; it allows of the capturing of every armed enemy, and every enemy of\r\nimportance to the hostile government, or of peculiar danger to the\r\ncaptor; it allows of all destruction of property, and obstruction of the\r\nways and channels of traffic, travel, or communication, and of all\r\nwithholding of sustenance or means of life from the enemy; of the\r\nappropriation of whatever an enemy’s country affords necessary for the\r\nsubsistence and safety of the army, and of such deception as does not\r\ninvolve the breaking of good faith, either positively pledged, regarding\r\nagreements entered into during the war, or supposed by the modern law of\r\nwar to exist. Men who take up arms against one another in public war do\r\nnot cease on this account to be moral beings, responsible to one\r\nanother, and to God. Military necessity does not admit of cruelty, that\r\nis, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering, or for\r\nrevenge, or of maiming or wounding, except in fight, or of torture to\r\nextort confessions. It does not admit of the use of poison in any way,\r\nor of the wanton devastation of a district. It admits of deception, but\r\ndisclaims acts of perfidy; and in general, military necessity does not\r\ninclude any act of hostility which makes the return to peace\r\nunnecessarily difficult.\r\n\r\n=Military Orders.= Religious associations which arose from the mixture\r\nof the religious enthusiasm and the chivalrous love of arms which almost\r\nequally formed the characteristic of mediæval society. The first origin\r\nof such associations may be traced to the necessities of the Christian\r\nresidents of the Holy Land, in which the monks, whose first duty had\r\nbeen to serve the pilgrims in the hospital at Jerusalem, were compelled\r\nby the necessity of self-defense to assume the character of soldiers as\r\nwell as of monks. (See SAINT JOHN OF JERUSALEM.) The order of the\r\nTemplars (see TEMPLAR, KNIGHTS) was of singular origin. Those of\r\nAlcantara and Calatrava (which see), in Spain, had for their immediate\r\nobject the defense of their country against the Moors. These orders as\r\nwell as that of Avis in Portugal, which was instituted with a similar\r\nview, followed the Cistercian rule, and all three differed from the\r\nTemplars and the Knights of St. John in being permitted by their\r\ninstitute to marry once. The same privilege was enjoyed in the Savoyard\r\norder of Knights of St. Maurice, and the Flemish order of St. Hubert. On\r\nthe contrary, the Teutonic Knights, who had their origin in the Crusades\r\n(see GRAND MASTER), were bound by an absolute vow of chastity. With the\r\nvarying conditions of society, these religious associations have at\r\nvarious times been abolished or fallen into disuse; but most of them\r\nstill subsist in the form of orders of knighthood, and in some of them,\r\nattempts have recently been made to revive, with certain modifications,\r\nthe monastic character which they originally possessed.\r\n\r\n=Military Positions.= See POSITIONS, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Military Punishment.= See PUNISHMENT, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Military Regulations.= The rules and regulations by which the\r\ndiscipline, formations, field-exercise, and movements of the whole army\r\nare directed, to be observed in one uniform system. See ARMY\r\nREGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n=Military Science.= See LOGISTICS, STRATAGEM, STRATEGY, TACTICS, and\r\nWAR.\r\n\r\n=Military Secretary.= An officer on the personal staff of generals in\r\nhigh command. His duties are to conduct the correspondence of his chief,\r\nand to transact a great amount of confidential business, which would\r\ndangerously occupy the time of the general himself. In the British\r\nservice the military secretary to the commander-in-chief is usually a\r\ngeneral officer. To a commander-in-chief in the field, he is for most\r\npart below that rank, while to a general commanding a division only, an\r\nassistant military secretary is allowed. His staff pay is of course\r\nadditional to the officer’s regimental or unattached pay.\r\n\r\n=Military Service.= In the feudal ages, a tenure of lands by knight’s\r\nservice, according to which the tenant was bound to perform service in\r\nwar unto the king, or the mesne lord, of whom he held by that tenure. As\r\nthe king gave to the great nobles, his immediate tenants, large\r\npossessions forever, to hold of him for this or that service or rent, so\r\nthey in time parceled out to such others as they liked, the same lands\r\nfor rents and services as they thought good. And these services were\r\ndivided into two sorts, chivalry and socage; the first whereof was\r\nmartial and military, whereby the tenant was obliged to perform some\r\nnoble or military office unto his lord. This was of two kinds: either\r\nregal, that is, held only by the king, or common, when held of a common\r\nperson. That which was held only of the king was called _servitium_, or\r\n_serjeantia_, and was again divided into grand and petit serjeantry. The\r\ngrand serjeantry was where one held lands of the king by service, which\r\nhe ought to do in his own person; as, to bear the king’s banner or\r\nspear, to lead his horse, or to find a man-at-arms to fight, etc. Petit\r\nserjeantry was when a man held lands of the king, to yield him annually\r\nsome small thing towards his wars, as a sword, dagger, bow, etc.\r\nChivalry that might be holden of a common person was termed _scutagium_,\r\nor _escuage_; that is, service of the shield, which was either uncertain\r\nor certain. _Escuage uncertain_ was likewise twofold: first, where the\r\ntenant was bound to follow his lord, by going in person to the king’s\r\nwars, or sending a sufficient man in his place, there to be maintained\r\nat his cost so long as was agreed upon between the lord and his first\r\ntenant at the granting of the fee. The days of such service seem to have\r\nbeen rated by the quantity of land so holden; as, if it extended to a\r\nwhole knight’s fee, then the knight was to follow his lord forty days;\r\nif but a half a knight’s fee, then twenty days; and if a fourth part,\r\nthen ten days, etc. The other kind of this escuage was called\r\n_castle-ward_, where the tenant was obliged by himself or some other, to\r\ndefend a castle as often as it should come to his turn.\r\n\r\n=Military Stores.= See STORES, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Military Tenure.= Tenure of land, on condition of performing military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Military Train.= A highly important corps of the army of Great Britain,\r\nof which the function is to transport the provisions, ammunition, and\r\nall other material, together with the wounded in time of battle. It was\r\nformed after the Crimean war, on the dissolution of the Land-Transport\r\nCorps. In the year 1863 it comprised 6 battalions, in all 1840 officers\r\nand men. The corps ranks after the Royal Engineers, and is classed as\r\nMounted Infantry, the officers receiving infantry rates, and the men\r\ncavalry rates of pay. The men are armed with carbine and sword, but\r\nrather for defensive than aggressive purposes. Attached to each\r\nbattalion are 166 horses, with proportionate wagons and ambulances. It\r\nis proper to observe that the Military Train constitutes the nucleus of\r\na transport service for a large army, and that in time of war it would\r\nbe expanded by the addition of thousands of horses or mules, and the\r\nincorporation of many hundred drivers, etc. The advantage of possessing\r\neven a few men ready trained and capable of directing the movements of\r\nothers was amply demonstrated by the failures of the Crimea in 1854-56;\r\nso that Parliament votes ungrudgingly the expense of this corps,\r\nalthough in time of peace it is comparatively without employment. It is\r\nnow termed the Army Service Corps.\r\n\r\n=Military Ways.= The large Roman roads which Agrippa caused to be made\r\nthrough the empire in the reign of Augustus for the marching of troops\r\nand conveying of carriages. They were paved from the gates of Rome to\r\nthe utmost limits of the empire. The British have constructed a military\r\nroad throughout India, with wells and other accommodations at certain\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\n=Militia.= From the Latin _miles_, a “soldier,” a term which was\r\nformerly synonymous with “military,” or the whole fighting force of a\r\ncountry, but in modern times has come to signify the domestic force for\r\nthe defense of a nation, as distinguished from the regular army, which\r\ncan be employed at home or abroad in either aggressive or defensive\r\noperations. Every nation has a reserve, under its law military, upon\r\nwhich its defense would fall on the discomfiture of the regular army;\r\nbut the system differs in each country. France has her _Gardes\r\nNationaux_, Prussia the _Landwehr_ and _Landsturm_, and similar\r\norganizations exist in other European states. It also comprehends the\r\nvolunteer organizations of Great Britain and the United States. The laws\r\nof the United States require the enrollment into the militia of all\r\nable-bodied males between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years,\r\nwith certain exceptions specified in general and State laws. The militia\r\nof each State is required to be arranged into companies, battalions,\r\nregiments, brigades, and divisions, as the Legislature of the State may\r\ndirect, and it shall be subject to military duty and shall serve a\r\ndefinite time. These organizations are to be officered by the respective\r\nStates, the grades and number of officers being named in the laws\r\nrequiring enrollment. The Constitution of the United States has given\r\nthe power to Congress to provide for “calling forth the militia to\r\nexecute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel\r\ninvasions.” Congress by legislation has given the President the\r\nauthority to call forth the militia under certain exigencies, as has\r\nbeen frequently done. When called into actual service of the United\r\nStates, the militia receive pay from the government, and are subject to\r\nthe Rules and Articles of War. The militia is therefore a part and\r\nparcel of the army of the United States, although in common use the term\r\nis limited to mean the regular army alone. The organized militia of the\r\nUnited States numbers 125,906 men, the number of men available for\r\nmilitary duty unorganized, is 6,598,105.\r\n\r\n=Militia-man.= One who belongs to the militia.\r\n\r\n=Mill, Gunpowder-.= Is a machine used for mixing or incorporating the\r\ningredients of which gunpowder is composed. The operation was formerly\r\neffected as follows: The ingredients being duly proportioned and put\r\ninto the mortars of the mills, which are hollow pieces of wood, each\r\ncapable of holding 20 pounds of paste, are incorporated by means of the\r\npestle and spindle. There are 24 mortars in each mill, where are made\r\neach day 480 pounds of gunpowder, care being taken to sprinkle the\r\ningredients in the mortars with water from time to time, lest they\r\nshould take fire. The pestle is a piece of wood 10 feet high, and 4¹⁄₂\r\ninches broad, armed at the bottom with a round piece of metal. It weighs\r\nabout 60 pounds. For more modern methods of incorporation, see\r\nGUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Mill Springs.= A village of Wayne Co., Ky., about 100 miles south of\r\nFrankfort. Near here a Federal force under Gen. Geo. H. Thomas defeated\r\na Confederate army under Gen. G. B. Crittenden, January 19, 1862. In\r\nthis engagement the Confederate general F. K. Zollicoffer was killed.\r\n\r\n=Mill-cake.= The incorporated materials for gunpowder, in the form of a\r\ndense mass or cake, ready to be subjected to the process of granulation.\r\n\r\n=Milliken’s Bend.= A village of Madison Parish, La., on the right bank\r\nof the Mississippi River, about 25 miles above Vicksburg. On June 6,\r\n1863, the Confederates under Gen. McCullough made an attack on this\r\nplace, which was defended by a body of colored troops and part of an\r\nIowa regiment, and were repulsed after a severe engagement.\r\n\r\n=Mim Bashy.= In the East Indies, a commander of 1000 horse.\r\n\r\n=Minas, Sabbatha.= A fort in Babylonia, built in the time of the later\r\nRoman empire on the site of Seleucia, which the Romans had destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Mincio.= A river of Lombardy, Italy. Here the Austrians were repulsed\r\nby the French under Brune, December 25-27, 1800, and by Eugene\r\nBeauharnais, February 8, 1814, near Valeggio.\r\n\r\n=Minden.= A strongly fortified town of Prussia, in Westphalia, situated\r\non the Weser, 35 miles southwest from Hanover. In its neighborhood the\r\nbattle of Minden was fought, on August 1, 1759, between the English,\r\nHessians, and Hanoverians (under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick), and the\r\nFrench were beaten and driven to the ramparts of Minden. Lord George\r\nSackville (afterwards Lord Germaine), who commanded the British and\r\nHanoverian horse, for some disobedience of orders was tried by a\r\ncourt-martial on his return to England, found guilty, and dismissed\r\nApril 22, 1760. He was afterwards restored to favor, and became\r\nsecretary of state, 1776.\r\n\r\n=Mines, Military.= Constitute one of the most important departments in\r\nmilitary engineering, and a very formidable accessory both in the attack\r\nand defense of fortresses. A military mine consists of a gallery of\r\ngreater or less length, run from some point of safety under an opposing\r\nwork, or under an area over which an attacking force must pass, and\r\nterminating in a chamber, which, being stored with gunpowder, can be\r\nexploded at the critical moment. Mines are of use to the besiegers in\r\nthe overthrow of ramparts and formation of a breach; the _countermines_\r\nof the besieged in undermining the glacis over which the assaulting\r\ncolumn must charge, and blowing them into the air, or in destroying\r\nbatteries erected for breaching, are equally serviceable. But far above\r\nthe actual mischief wrought by the mine--often very great--is its moral\r\ninfluence on the troops, and especially on the assailants. Mines are\r\neither vertical,--when they are called _shafts_,--horizontal, or\r\ninclined, in either of which cases they are “galleries,” the word\r\n“ascending” or “descending” being added, if there be inclination. The\r\ndimensions range from the “great gallery,” 6 feet 6 inches by 7 feet, to\r\nthe “small branch,”--the last diminutive of the gallery,--which has but\r\n2 feet 6 inches height, with a breadth of 2 feet. The most frequent work\r\nis the “common gallery,” 4 feet 6 inches by 3 feet, which is considered\r\nthe easiest for the miner.\r\n\r\n=Minié Ball.= A ball or bullet of peculiar construction. It is cast\r\nhollow for nearly two-thirds of its length, and into the opening of the\r\ninternal cylinder there is introduced a small concave piece of iron,\r\nwhich the powder at the moment of firing forces into the slug, spreading\r\nit open, and causing it to fit perfectly to the barrel. Hence a great\r\nincrease in the precision of aim and the extent of range.\r\n\r\n=Minié Rifle.= A species of fire-arm, invented by Capt. Minié, from whom\r\nit receives its name. It is certain in aim, and fatal in its results at\r\n800 yards.\r\n\r\n=Mining.= In military affairs, is the art of blowing up any part of a\r\nfortification, building, etc., by gunpowder. The art of mining requires\r\na perfect knowledge both of fortifications and geometry; and by these\r\nprevious helps, the engineer may be qualified to ascertain correctly the\r\nnature of all manner of heights, depths, breadths, and thicknesses; to\r\njudge perfectly of slopes and perpendiculars, whether they be such as\r\nare parallel to the horizon, or such as are visual; together with the\r\ntrue levels of all kinds of earth. To which must be added, a consummate\r\nskill in the quality of rocks, earths, masonry, and sands; the whole\r\naccompanied with a thorough knowledge of the strength of all sorts of\r\ngunpowder.\r\n\r\n=Minion.= An ancient form of ordnance of small size, the caliber of\r\nwhich was about 3 inches.\r\n\r\n=Minister.= Is one who acts not by any inherent authority of his own,\r\nbut under another. Thus, in England all ministers act under a supreme\r\nauthority, which is vested in the sovereign, lords, and commons, to whom\r\nthey are responsible. In military matters, there is not only a war\r\nminister, but a secretary at war, who likewise acts conjointly with the\r\nsecretary of state. All dispatches and papers of consequence relating to\r\nthe army must first pass through the secretary of state, and the war\r\nminister, before they are laid before Parliament, or otherwise acted\r\nupon by the secretary at war. The common arrangements of corps,\r\ndirections with respect to marching, are transmitted to the secretary at\r\nwar, and to the quartermaster-general’s office, without previously\r\npassing through the secretary of state, or war minister. See SECRETARY\r\nOF WAR.\r\n\r\n=Minnesota.= One of the Northwestern States of the American Union. The\r\ncountry was visited by white traders as early as 1654, but very few\r\nsettlements were made in it until about 1845. The eastern part of the\r\nState formed a portion of the French possessions which were ceded to the\r\nBritish in 1763, and by them to the United States in 1783. The remaining\r\npart belonged to the Louisiana Territory, which was purchased from the\r\nFrench in 1803. The country was traversed by an exploring expedition\r\nunder Gen. Pike in 1805. A territorial government was organized in 1849,\r\nand in 1853 Minnesota was admitted into the Union as a State. The State\r\nsuffered severely in 1862 from an inroad of the Sioux, who destroyed\r\nwhole settlements. They were soon afterwards, however, summarily\r\npunished, and removed from the State altogether.\r\n\r\n=Minnetarees.= A tribe of Indians, formerly a branch of the Crows, but\r\nnow affiliated to the Mandans, who reside on the Upper Missouri. They\r\nhave always been friendly to the whites, and hostile to the Sioux, at\r\nwhose hands they have suffered severely. They number about 400.\r\n\r\n=Minor.= Under age. Minors will not be enlisted in the army of the\r\nUnited States without the consent of their parents or guardians. If any\r\nhave enlisted and it becomes known, the Secretary of War, on demand, is\r\nrequired to grant the discharges from the army of minors who have\r\nenlisted without the consent of their parents or guardians.\r\n\r\n=Minorca.= One of the Balearic Islands (which see) in the Mediterranean.\r\nIt was captured by Lieut.-Gen. Stanhope and Sir John Leake in 1708, and\r\nwas ceded to the British by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713; taken by the\r\nSpanish and French in July, 1756, and Admiral Byng fell a victim to\r\npublic indignation for not relieving it. It was restored to the British\r\nat the peace in 1793; besieged by the Spaniards, and taken February 5,\r\n1782; captured by the British under Gen. Stuart, without the loss of a\r\nman, November 15, 1798; but was given up at the peace of Amiens in 1802.\r\n\r\n=Minturnæ= (_Minturnensis_; now _Trajetto_). An important town in\r\nLatium, on the frontiers of Campania; was situated on the Appia Via, and\r\non both banks of the Liris, and near the mouth of this river. It was an\r\nancient town of the Ausones, or Aurunci, but surrendered to the Romans\r\nof its own accord, 296 B.C. In its neighborhood Marius was taken\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n=Minute.= A hasty sketch taken of anything in writing. Hence minutes of\r\na general or regimental court-martial.\r\n\r\n=Minute-gun.= A gun discharged every minute, as a signal of distress or\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\n=Minute-man.= A man enlisted for service wherever required, and ready to\r\nmarch at a moment’s notice;--a term used in the American Revolution.\r\n\r\n=Minutes of Councils in the Military Department.= The notification of\r\norders and regulations, which are directed to be observed by the British\r\narmy in India, are so called. These minutes receive the sanction of the\r\ngovernor-general in council, and are the result of previous\r\ncommunications from the court of directors in Europe. The answer to the\r\nFrench word, _resultat_, which was prefixed to all orders and\r\nregulations that were occasionally issued by the military boards, or\r\n_conseils de guerre_, for the government of the army. The term,\r\n_jugement d’un conseil de guerre_, corresponded with our minutes of a\r\ngeneral or garrison court-martial, and expressed not only the minutes,\r\nbut the sentence of the court.\r\n\r\n=Miquelets= (_Fr._). Bandits, who have infested the Pyrenean Mountains;\r\narmed mountaineers of the Pyrenees; the name is now borne by the\r\ncaptain-general’s guard; in 1808, Napoleon organized a corps of\r\n_miquelets Français_, who rendered good services.\r\n\r\n=Miqueletti.= A small body of mountain fusiliers, who formerly belonged\r\nto the Neapolitan army.\r\n\r\n=Mire= (_Fr._). In the French artillery, a piece of wood about 4 inches\r\nthick, 1 foot high, and 2¹⁄₂ feet long, which is used in pointing\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\n=Mireur= (_Fr._). An instrument employed in coast batteries for\r\nascertaining whether the enemy’s ships are within the range of the guns,\r\nand thus to prevent the gunners from expending their shot unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n=Mirmillones.= A class of Roman gladiators; said to have been so called\r\nfrom their having the image of a fish on their helmets. Their arms were\r\nlike those of the Gauls; hence we find that they were also called Galli.\r\nThey were usually matched with the retiarii or Thracians.\r\n\r\n=Mirror.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON; also LOOKING-GLASS SIGNALING.\r\n\r\n=Misbehavior before the Enemy.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 42.\r\n\r\n=Miscellaneous.= An item or charge in the estimates of the British army,\r\nso distinguished as _miscellaneous services_; the same as our contingent\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\n=Misconduct at Divine Service.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 52.\r\n\r\n=Misconduct in Time of War.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 55, 56, 57,\r\nand 58.\r\n\r\n=Misericorde= (_Fr._). A short dagger, which the cavalry formerly used,\r\nfor the purpose of dispatching an enemy who would not ask quarter or\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n=Misnomer.= The mistaking of the true name of a person; the using of one\r\nname for another. If a prisoner plead a misnomer before a court-martial,\r\nthe court may ask the prisoner what is his real name, and call upon him\r\nto plead to the amended charge.--_Hough._\r\n\r\n=Miss.= To fail to hit; to fly wide; as, the bullet missed its mark.\r\n\r\n=Missile.= Capable of being thrown; adapted for hurling, or to be\r\nprojected from the hand, or from any instrument or engine; as, to wing\r\nthe missile dart.\r\n\r\n=Missile.= A weapon thrown or intended to be thrown, for doing\r\nexecution; as, a lance, an arrow, or a bullet.\r\n\r\n=Missing.= Wanting; not present when called or looked for; lost; as, 100\r\nsoldiers are wounded and missing.\r\n\r\n=Mississagas.= A tribe of Indians of Algonkin stock, who formerly\r\nresided on the north shore of Lake Huron, but are now found to the\r\nnumber of 700 in Ontario. They were one of the Confederate tribes of the\r\n“Seven Nations,” fought as allies of the French against the English\r\n(1743-48), sided with the English in the seven years’ war against the\r\nFrench and in the war against Pontiac, and aided the Canadian forces\r\nagainst the United States in the war of 1812.\r\n\r\n=Mississippi.= One of the Southwestern States of the American\r\nConfederacy. It was first visited by Europeans about the year 1540, when\r\nDe Soto, with 1000 followers, crossed the State on an exploring\r\nexpedition from Florida, and remained in it for nearly a year. This\r\nparty having suffered severely by attacks from the aborigines, no other\r\nattempt was made to establish a permanent colony till 1682, when La\r\nSalle descended the Mississippi and visited this region. He returned in\r\ntwo years with a party which he intended to settle in Mississippi, but\r\nmeeting with misfortunes, the colony never reached its destination. The\r\nnext attempt at settlement was made by Iberville, but with no successful\r\nresult. The settlement at Fort Rosalie (now Natchez) in 1716, by some\r\nFrenchmen under Bienville, was generally considered the first permanent\r\ncolony. A general massacre of the white inhabitants by the savages took\r\nplace in 1728, but, as in every other contest between the Indians and\r\nthe whites, victory ultimately rested with the latter. Other conflicts\r\nin 1736, 1739, and 1752, though carried on for a time with varying\r\nsuccess, had the same result. At the peace of Paris, in 1763,\r\nMississippi became a part of the English territory. Soon after a portion\r\nof the French, so inhumanly driven by the English from Nova Scotia,\r\nsettled in Mississippi; and in 1768 commenced an emigration from the\r\nEastern colonies by way of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. In 1798 the\r\nUnited States having attained the rights of the British government in\r\nthis region, erected it into a Territory, and in 1817 it was admitted\r\ninto the Union as an independent State. Mississippi was one of the first\r\nof the Southern States to secede from the Union, and it suffered\r\nseverely during the civil war. It was the scene of several engagements,\r\nraids, etc., the most important being the battles of Iuka, Corinth,\r\nsiege and capture of Vicksburg, and raids to Meridian.\r\n\r\n=Missive.= Intended to be thrown, hurled, or ejected; missile. “The\r\nmissive weapons fly.”\r\n\r\n=Missolonghi=, or =Mesolonghi=. A town of Greece, in the government of\r\nÆtolia, is separated from the sea by a large lake. It is noted for the\r\nmemorable siege it sustained in 1825-26. In the beginning of 1825 it was\r\ngarrisoned by 5000 Greeks, who were commanded by Nóthi Bozzaris; and on\r\nApril 25 of the same year a Turkish force of 20,000 under Reshid Pasha\r\nappeared before Missolonghi, which was poorly fortified. On May 11, the\r\nfirst bombardment began, and for the space of two months afterwards the\r\ntown was exposed to numerous bombardments and assaults; but the\r\ndefenders were not less active in answering the enemy’s fire, and making\r\nsallies from their defenses, by which means they succeeded in repelling\r\ntheir assailants, and inflicting on them considerable loss. During this\r\ntime they were supplied with ammunition and provisions by the fleet\r\nwhich was stationed at the entrance of the lake; but on July 10, a\r\nsuperior Turkish fleet, after compelling the ships of Greece to retire,\r\nsucceeded in landing a strong reinforcement to the besiegers. The\r\nassaults on the town were then renewed with increased fury, and the\r\ncannonade of the Turks carried destruction to its frail ramparts and\r\ndeath among the ranks of its brave defenders. Yet the garrison, though\r\nreduced to the number of 4000, continued to maintain their ground until,\r\nin the month of August, the Greek fleet appeared in the offing, and by\r\ndefeating the Turkish squadron relieved Missolonghi for a time from the\r\nblockade. But the sultan was resolved at all hazards to reduce this\r\nstronghold of liberty; and in the end of November the Greek ships were\r\nagain driven off, and the blockade renewed by the combined Turkish,\r\nEgyptian, and Barbary fleets. In the beginning of 1826 the besieging\r\narmy was reinforced by the arrival of 14,000 troops under Ibrahim Pasha,\r\nwho took command of all the besieging forces. On January 25, a\r\nbombardment was commenced, which lasted for three days, and reduced the\r\ntown to ruins, but could not shake the resolute courage of the Greeks.\r\nThe repeated assaults of the enemy were still repulsed with great loss.\r\nAt last, reduced to the utmost extremities by famine, and seeing on all\r\nsides nothing but the ships and tents of the enemy, yet never\r\nentertaining any thought of surrender, the Greeks determined to force\r\ntheir way through the opposing ranks. Although by treachery the enemy\r\nwas made aware of their design, and thus prepared to meet them, they\r\nwere not able to prevent nearly 2000 of the besieged from making their\r\nway to the mountains. Many prisoners fell into the hands of the Turks,\r\nand the remainder, who were unable from their wounds or weariness to\r\naccompany their fellows, continued to defend themselves among the ruins\r\nuntil the explosion of a powder-magazine, destroying alike friends and\r\nfoes, put an end to the bloody conflict. Such was the siege of\r\nMissolonghi, which attracted, during its continuance, the eyes of all\r\nEurope, and in which the Greeks showed themselves the worthy sons of the\r\nheroes of Marathon and Thermopylæ.\r\n\r\n=Missouri.= One of the Central States of the Mississippi Valley, and the\r\nfirst organized wholly west of the Mississippi River. The French were\r\nthe earliest settlers in the country, having built a fort there in 1719.\r\nBy the treaty of 1763 it was ceded to Spain, with all the territory west\r\nof the Mississippi. Spain being at war with England during the American\r\nRevolution, her colonies were harassed by the English and their Indians\r\nallies. In 1780, a body of British and Indians attacked and besieged St.\r\nLouis, killing 60 of its defenders. The siege was raised by Col. Clark,\r\nan American, who came to the relief of the place with 500 men. In 1800\r\nSpain restored the territory to France, and it passed to the United\r\nStates by purchase in 1803. After the admission of Louisiana as a State\r\nin 1812, the remaining portion of the territory received the name of\r\nMissouri, from which was separated the State of that name in 1821.\r\nThough the State officially declared itself in favor of the Union in\r\n1861, many of its prominent citizens sided with the Confederates. It\r\nwas the scene of several engagements during the civil war.\r\n\r\n=Missouria Indians.= A tribe of Dakota stock, who reside at the Otoe\r\nagency, Nebraska. They number about 200, and are progressing favorably\r\nin the arts of civilization.\r\n\r\n=Mithridatic War.= The name of the celebrated contest carried on for a\r\nlong series of years by the Romans against Mithridates VI., king of\r\nPontus. It was caused by the massacre of about 100,000 Romans by\r\nMithridates, 88 B.C., and remarkable for its duration, its many\r\nsanguinary battles, and the cruelties of its commanders. Mithridates\r\nhaving taken the consul Aquilius, made him ride on an ass through a\r\ngreat part of Asia, crying out as he rode, “I am Aquilius, consul of the\r\nRomans.” He is said to have killed him by causing melted gold to be\r\npoured down his throat, in derision of his avarice, 85 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Mitigate.= To diminish the severity of; as, to mitigate punishment; to\r\nreduce in amount of severity, as a penalty. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF\r\nWAR, 112.\r\n\r\n=Mitraille= (_Fr._). Small pieces of old iron, such as heads of nails,\r\netc., with which pieces of ordnance are sometimes loaded.\r\n\r\n=Mitrailleur.= A gun in which several barrels are combined in order to\r\nproduce a greater effect by the rapid succession of a number of shots.\r\nMitrailleures existed as early as the 14th century. They were called\r\n_killing-organs_ at that time. The Scaligers at the end of the 14th\r\ncentury, the Protestant princes of Germany in the Smalkaldian war, and\r\nAustria in the war against Turkey, used this kind of gun. But the\r\nancient mitrailleur differs from the modern both in dimensions and in\r\nthe positions of the barrels. A peculiar kind of mitrailleur was the\r\n_espingol_, each barrel being loaded with several shots, which, by a\r\nslowly-burning charge, were discharged one after the other. The\r\n_espingol_ was used not only in the Middle Ages, but also recently,--by\r\nthe Danes in 1848-50, and 1863-64. At the storming of Düppel the\r\nPrussians took about thirty such guns. In modern times the term has been\r\nspecifically applied to certain battery guns employed by the French in\r\nthe Franco-Prussian war. (See BATTERY GUN.) In the U. S. Light Artillery\r\nTactics the term mitrailleur is applied to the Gatling gun.\r\n\r\n=Mitylene=, or =Midulu= (anc. _Lesbos_). An island of the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, belonging to Turkey, and lying off the west coast of Asia\r\nMinor. Mitylene suffered much in the Greek war of independence, in the\r\ncourse of which it lost nearly the half of its inhabitants. (See\r\nMYTILENE.)\r\n\r\n=Moabites.= A tribe descended from Moab, the son of Lot, and\r\nconsequently related to the Hebrews; they inhabited the mountainous\r\ncountry east of the lower part of the Jordan and of the Dead Sea. In the\r\ntime of the Judges, the Jews were for eighteen years under the yoke of\r\nthe Moabites, who were afterwards made tributary by David, but about\r\n900 B.C. shook off their allegiance to the Jewish kings, and after the\r\nAssyrians invaded the land of Judah, took part with the Chaldeans\r\nagainst the Jews.\r\n\r\n=Moat.= The ditch round the ramparts of a fortress may be either\r\nwet--_i.e._, full of water--or dry. In the latter, which is the commoner\r\ncase, the depth should not be less than 12 feet, nor the width under 24.\r\nThe more perpendicular the walls, so much the greater will be the\r\nobstruction to the enemy. In regular works the walls are usually reveted\r\nwith masonry, that at the foot of the rampart being the scarp or escarp,\r\nand that below the covered way the counterscarp. See DITCH.\r\n\r\n=Mobile.= A city and capital of Mobile Co., Ala., situated on the west\r\nbank of the Mobile River, immediately above its entrance into the bay of\r\nthe same name. It was founded by Bienville in 1711, passed into the\r\nhands of the English in 1763, was taken by the Spanish general Galvez in\r\n1780, and was confirmed to Spain by the treaty of 1783. Mobile was\r\nblockaded by the Federal fleet in May, 1861. In 1864 the Confederates\r\nconstructed several ironclads and gunboats, and threatened to raise the\r\nblockade. On August 5, Admiral Farragut with his fleet passed Forts\r\nMorgan and Gaines, the Confederate fortifications guarding the entrance\r\nto Mobile Bay, captured the ram “Tennessee” and the gunboat “Selma,” and\r\neffectually crippled the “Gaines.” With the co-operation of the land\r\nforces, the forts were soon captured, and the city was effectually cut\r\noff from external commerce. Mobile was evacuated by the Confederates,\r\nand surrendered to Gen. Canby and Rear-Admiral Thatcher, April 12, 1865,\r\nabout 1000 prisoners, 150 guns, and a large quantity of ammunition and\r\nsupplies falling into the hands of the Federals.\r\n\r\n=Mobilization.= The calling into active service troops not previously on\r\nthe war establishment.\r\n\r\n=Mobilize.= To call into active service;--applied to troops which,\r\nthough enrolled, were not previously on the war establishment.\r\n\r\n=Moccasin= (Algonkin, _makisin_). A shoe or cover for the foot, made of\r\ndeer-skin or soft leather, without a sole, and ornamented on the upper\r\nside; the customary shoe worn by the American Indians.\r\n\r\n=Möckern.= A town of Prussian Saxony, 13 miles east of Madgeburg, on the\r\nEhle. Here the French army under Eugène Beauharnais was defeated by the\r\nPrussians under York, April, 1813, and here Blücher defeated the French,\r\nOctober 16, 1813.\r\n\r\n=Modena= (anc. _Mutina_). A fortified city of Northern Italy, 24 miles\r\nwest-northwest of Bologna, capital of the former duchy of the same name.\r\nIn ancient times Mutina was an important town of Gallia Cispadana,\r\nsituated on the Via Æmilia; it fell into the hands of the Romans in 218\r\nB.C., who established a colony here thirty-five years later; in 117 B.C.\r\nthe settlers were disturbed by an incursion of the Ligurians, who for a\r\nshort time held possession of the town, but were ultimately expelled by\r\nConsul Claudius; it was held by M. Brutus against the victorious Pompey;\r\nsustained a siege of about four months against the troops of Mark\r\nAntony; besieged and taken by Constantine in 312; was laid waste by\r\nAttila in 452. The modern town is surrounded with walls, and defended by\r\nbastions and a citadel; was governed by the house of Este from 1288 till\r\n1796, when the last male of that house, the reigning duke, Hercules\r\nIII., was expelled by the French. By the treaty of Campo Formio the\r\nModenese possessions were incorporated with the Cisalpine republic,\r\n1797, and with the kingdom of Italy, 1805. The Archduke Francis of Este,\r\nson of the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, and of Mary, the heiress of\r\nthe last duke, was restored in 1814. Modena was annexed to Sardinia\r\nMarch 18, 1860.\r\n\r\n=Modocs.= A treacherous tribe of Indians of the Klamath nation. In 1872\r\nthey left the Klamath reservation under the leadership of their chief,\r\nCaptain Jack, and refused to return. Military aid was invoked to compel\r\nthem, and the troops were fired upon by the Indians, who retreated to\r\nthe almost inaccessible fastnesses of the lava-beds. Here they held out\r\nuntil June 5, 1873, by which time nearly all were killed or captured.\r\nCaptain Jack and some of the principal men of his tribe were tried by\r\nmilitary commission for the murder of Gen. Canby and Mr. Thomas, Indian\r\npeace commissioner, who were treacherously slain in April while\r\nattending a conference with the Indians outside the camp. Captain Jack\r\nand three others were hanged October 3, 1873, and the remainder of the\r\ntribe deported to Indian Territory.\r\n\r\n=Mœsia.= A Roman province in Europe. It was invaded by the Romans, when\r\nC. Scribonius Curio gained a victory over the Mœsians (75 B.C.), but not\r\nuntil the reign of Augustus was it finally subdued, 29 B.C. A line of\r\nfortresses was then planted for its defense along the southern bank of\r\nthe Danube. The principal of these were afterwards known as Singidunum\r\n(Belgrade), Viminacium, and Axiopolis. It was successfully invaded by\r\nthe Goths, numbers of whom eventually settled here. In the 7th century\r\ninvading hordes of Bulgarians and Sclavonians founded the kingdoms of\r\nBulgaria and Servia, which now comprise the territory of ancient Mœsia.\r\n\r\n=Mogador=, =Mogodor=, or =Suerrah=. A seaport town of Morocco, on the\r\nAtlantic, 132 miles southwest from Morocco. Mogador is walled and\r\nfortified; but its defenses, which are the work of Genoese engineers,\r\nare of no great strength; its harbor, although much exposed, is\r\nconsidered the best on the coast. Mogador was bombarded in 1844 by a\r\nFrench fleet under the Prince de Joinville, on which occasion it\r\nsuffered severely.\r\n\r\n=Mognions= (_Fr._). A sort of armor for the shoulders.\r\n\r\n=Mograbian.= A soldier of a branch of the Turkish infantry composed of\r\nthe peasants of the northern part of Africa, who sought to better their\r\ncondition by entering foreign service.\r\n\r\n=Mogul Empire, The.= An empire which at one time extended over the\r\ngreater part of Northern India. It was founded by Sultan Baber, a\r\ndescendant of Timur (or Tamerlane), in 1526, and lasted until 1749, when\r\nthe Mogul army was totally defeated by the Rohillas, and the empire was\r\nbroken up into a number of petty sovereignties. In 1857, Mohammed\r\nBahadur, the last king of Delhi and head of the Mogul empire, joined in\r\nthe Indian mutiny, and was transported to Rangoon (1858), where he soon\r\nafter died.\r\n\r\n=Mohacs.= A town of Southern Hungary, on the western arm of the Danube.\r\nIt owes its historical importance to the great battle fought here,\r\nAugust 29, 1526, between Louis II. of Hungary, with 25,000 Hungarians,\r\nand the sultan Solyman, at the head of about 200,000 Turks. The battle\r\nresulted in the disastrous defeat of the Hungarians, who lost their\r\nking, seven bishops, many nobles and dignitaries, and upwards of 22,000\r\nmen. A second battle was fought here on August 12, 1687, when the Turks\r\nin their turn were defeated by an Austro-Hungarian army under Charles of\r\nLorraine.\r\n\r\n=Mohammerah.= A Persian town near the Euphrates; captured, after two\r\nhours’ cannonading, by Sir James Outram, during the Persian war, March\r\n26, 1857.\r\n\r\n=Mohawks=, or =Maquas=. A warlike tribe of Indians who formerly\r\ninhabited the valley in the State of New York which bears their name.\r\nThey were allied with the Onondagas, Oneidas, Senecas, Cayugas, and\r\nTuscaroras, the confederation constituting what was known as the “Five\r\nNations.” They were allies of the English in their wars with the French,\r\nand in the Revolutionary war. After the peace of 1783 they removed to\r\nUpper Canada, and settled on Grand River upon lands procured for them by\r\ntheir chief, Brant.\r\n\r\n=Mohegans=, or =Mohicans=. A tribe of Indians of Algonkin stock, who\r\nformerly inhabited a considerable part of New England, and a part of New\r\nYork. The town of Norwich, Conn., called Mohegan by the Indians, is\r\nsituated about the centre of their ancient country. When the English\r\nfirst settled at Hartford, Uncas, the chief of the tribe, formed a\r\ntreaty of amity with them, which appears to have been generally\r\nobserved. The Mohegans were long the sworn foes of the Narragansetts.\r\nThe latter, under their chief, Miantonomoh, invaded the Mohegan country\r\nin 1643, but were defeated by Uncas, who captured Miantonomoh and put\r\nhim to death in September of that year. In 1645, the Narragansetts,\r\nunder Passacus, the brother of Miantonomoh, burning to avenge the death\r\nof that chief, again invaded the Mohegan territory. On this occasion\r\nthey were more successful. They laid waste the country in all\r\ndirections, and compelled Uncas and his warriors to take refuge in his\r\nstrong fortress at Shantock, which they would probably have become\r\nmasters of but for the timely assistance of the English, who furnished a\r\nsupply of provisions to the besieged. The invasion was again repeated,\r\nand with almost fatal effect to Uncas. The English again saved him,\r\nhowever, and after nearly twenty years of strife the hatchet was at\r\nlength buried between these tribes.\r\n\r\n=Mohilow.= A town in Russia, where the Russian army under Prince\r\nBagration was signally defeated by the French under Marshal Davoust,\r\nprince of Eckmühl, July 23, 1812.\r\n\r\n=Mohrungen.= A town of East Prussia, 62 miles south-southwest of\r\nKönigsberg. The French defeated the Russians here in 1807.\r\n\r\n=Moienne= (_Fr._). A piece of ordnance, which is now called a 4-pounder,\r\nand which is 10 feet long, was formerly so called.\r\n\r\n=Moineau.= A small, flat bastion, raised in front of an intended\r\nfortification, to defend it against attacks from small-arms.\r\n\r\n=Mojave Indians.= A tribe of aborigines, of Apache stock, residing in\r\nArizona. They number about 2100, of whom about one-third are located on\r\na reservation on the Colorado River, and about an equal number (known as\r\nMojave Apaches) at the San Carlos agency, Arizona.\r\n\r\n=Moldavia.= A province in the northeastern part of Turkey in Europe. The\r\nprinces of Moldavia were formerly called _voyvodes_, or military\r\nleaders, a name which was afterwards changed by the Turks to that of\r\n_hospodars_, which is still retained. In the 13th century Moldavia was\r\nfrequently disturbed by civil war, occasioned by rival claimants for the\r\ncrown, and these dissensions rose to such a height that the country was\r\ndivided into two parts, one of which acknowledged the sovereignty of\r\nPoland, and the other that of Hungary. A union was, however, soon after\r\neffected, and Moldavia became subject to Hungary, paying at the same\r\ntime a tribute to the Poles. In 1536 Moldavia came under the protection\r\nof the sultan; for a considerable time after this period, it was the\r\nscene of constant wars between the Poles and Turks, until the claims of\r\nthe former to the sovereignty of the state were finally abandoned in\r\n1621, and peace concluded between Turkey and Poland; in 1738, during the\r\nwar of Austria and Russia against Turkey, Moldavia was invaded by a\r\nRussian force, and occupied for two years, but was evacuated after the\r\npeace of Belgrade; in 1769 it was again occupied by the Russians, and\r\nbecame for a short time subject to the czar, but was restored to Turkey\r\nin 1774; in 1789 this unfortunate principality was again the scene of\r\ncontest between Russia and Turkey, until the peace of Jassy in 1792,\r\nwhen the Russian frontier was fixed by the Dneister; in the war of\r\n1807-12, Moldavia again fell into the hands of the Russians, who, by the\r\ntreaty of Bucharest, acquired possession of Bessarabia, and thus\r\nextended their frontier to the Pruth. At the commencement of the Greek\r\nwar in 1820 an insurrection broke out in the Danubian principalities,\r\nbut it was suppressed by the Turks; in 1828 another war between Turkey\r\nand Russia broke out, and Moldavia was occupied by the Russians without\r\nopposition until peace was established by the treaty of Adrianople in\r\n1829. A conspiracy was formed in 1840, to unite the principalities of\r\nMoldavia and Wallachia into one state, but without success. In 1848 the\r\ninfluence of revolutionary sentiments was felt in Moldavia; the people\r\nof Jassy demanded a new constitution, and, although the hospodar\r\nsuccessfully resisted this movement, he laid down his authority in the\r\nsame year. In 1853 a Russian army took possession of Moldavia and\r\nWallachia; after attempting in vain to cross the Danube in Wallachia,\r\nthe Russians, in the spring of 1854, crossed that river at Galatz, and\r\nseized the fortresses in the Dobrudscha; they then proceeded to lay\r\nsiege to Silistria, but this town was so vigorously defended that they\r\nwere obliged to raise the siege, and the British and French troops\r\nhaving arrived at Varna, the Russian army evacuated the principalities\r\nin the autumn of 1854; the hospodars then returned to their respective\r\ngovernments, and the principalities were occupied by an Austrian army.\r\nAt a conference at Paris, August 19, 1858, it was decided that the\r\nprincipalities should thenceforth be called the United Principalities of\r\nMoldavia and Wallachia, and should have in common a central commission\r\nand court of appeal, but be governed by different hospodars, to be\r\nelected by the people, and confirmed by the Porte.\r\n\r\n=Molded Powder.= See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Mole.= A mound or massive work formed of large stones laid in the sea,\r\nextended either in a right line or an arc of a circle before a port,\r\nwhich it serves to defend from the violence of the waves, thus\r\nprotecting ships in harbor; also, sometimes the harbor itself.\r\n\r\n=Molino del Rey.= A range of massive stone buildings, about 500 yards\r\nlong, forming the western side of an inclosure which surrounds the rock\r\nand castle, groves and fields of Chapultepec, 2 miles southwest of the\r\ncity of Mexico. These buildings were occupied by the troops of Santa\r\nAnna in September, 1847, to intercept the march of the American army\r\nunder command of Gen. Scott upon the city of Mexico. They were attacked\r\non the morning of the 8th by Gen. Worth’s division, and, after a severe\r\ncontest, the buildings were captured, with a loss to the Americans of\r\n787 killed and wounded (including 59 officers), out of 3447, the whole\r\nnumber engaged. The Mexican forces numbered about 10,000 men.\r\n\r\n=Mollwitz.= A village of Prussian Silesia; to the east of it lies the\r\ncelebrated battle-field where Frederick II. of Prussia gained his first\r\nvictory over the Austrians, April 10, 1741.\r\n\r\n=Moluccas=, or =Spice Islands=. A numerous group of islands in the\r\nAsiatic Archipelago, situated between Celebes on the west, and New\r\nGuinea on the east, and stretching from lat. 2° N. to lat. 9° S. They\r\nwere discovered by the Portuguese about 1510; became dependencies of\r\nHolland, 1795; during the French war of 1796, however, they were taken\r\nby the British, who held possession of them till 1800, when they were\r\nreturned to Holland. The islands were again occupied by the British in\r\n1810, but were finally restored to the Dutch in 1814, by the treaty of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n=Molycrium.= A town in the most southerly part of Ætolia; it was founded\r\nby the Corinthians, but was afterwards taken possession of by the\r\nÆtolians.\r\n\r\n=Mombas.= A seaport town of Africa, on a small island, in a bay on the\r\ncoast of Zanzibar. It was first visited by the Portuguese under Vasco de\r\nGama in 1498. In 1505, Francisco de Almeida, the Portuguese viceroy of\r\nIndia, took and burnt the town; in 1529 the Portuguese returned and\r\nrepeated their work of destruction, and retained the city from that date\r\nto 1720, when Mombas fell into the hands of the imam of Muscat, but he\r\nwas soon dispossessed by a rebellion of the inhabitants. It was under\r\nBritish protection from 1824 to 1826, and is now governed by an Arab\r\nsheikh.\r\n\r\n=Momentum.= Is that force possessed by a body in motion; and is measured\r\nby the product of the mass of the body into its velocity.\r\n\r\n=Mona= (now _Anglesey_). An island off the coast of the Ordovices, in\r\nBritain; it was invaded by Suetonius Paulinus, 61, and was conquered by\r\nAgricola, 78.\r\n\r\n=Moncontour.= A town near Poitiers, in France. Here Admiral Coligny and\r\nthe French Protestants were defeated by the Duke of Anjou, October 3,\r\n1569.\r\n\r\n=Mondovi.= A town of Northern Italy, near the river Ellero, about 47\r\nmiles south from Turin. The town is defended by walls and a small\r\ncitadel, and contains a great number of religious houses. The French,\r\nunder Napoleon I., defeated the Sardinian troops, under Colli, near this\r\ntown in 1796, and in 1799 the town was sacked by the French under Soult.\r\n\r\n=Monghir.= A town of Hindostan, East Indies, situated on the southern\r\nbank of the Ganges. It was an object of contention between the kings of\r\nBehar and Bengal in the early part of the 16th century; taken by the\r\nBritish in 1763.\r\n\r\n=Mongolia.= A vast district in Asia. Its present boundaries east and\r\nnorth are Manchuria and Siberia, respectively, and on the south and\r\nwest Thibet and Turkestan; but these boundaries have varied greatly at\r\ndifferent periods of history. The whole of what is now usually\r\nrecognized as Mongolia is considered to belong to the Chinese empire.\r\nSee TARTARY.\r\n\r\n=Mongols.= See TARTARY.\r\n\r\n=Monmouth, Battle of.= Was fought June 28, 1778, between the\r\nRevolutionary forces under Gen. Washington and the British under Sir\r\nHenry Clinton. Gen. Washington, whose army of about 12,000 men was\r\nencamped at Valley Forge, being informed of the intention of the enemy\r\nto evacuate Philadelphia and proceed to New York, placed his forces in a\r\ncondition to march immediately in pursuit. Accordingly, when\r\nintelligence of the evacuation reached him, he broke up his encampment,\r\nand detaching a small force under Gen. Arnold to take possession of\r\nPhiladelphia, marched rapidly with his whole army toward the Delaware.\r\nOn the morning of June 28 the advance of the Colonial army, under Gen.\r\nLee, became engaged with the enemy’s rear on the plain near Monmouth\r\nCourt-house, in New Jersey; but the English line being soon reinforced,\r\nthe Americans were compelled to give way, upon which Lee ordered a\r\nretreat. Gen. Washington, who was riding ahead of the main body of his\r\narmy, met the retreating force, and peremptorily ordered Lee to reform\r\nhis troops and hold his position. This he for a time partially effected,\r\nbut was being again driven back, when the main body of the army arrived\r\nto his assistance. The battle now became general, and under the\r\ninspiring influence of their commander-in-chief the Americans fought\r\nwith such desperate resolution that the British were at length obliged\r\nto give way. Washington made preparations to follow up his advantage,\r\nbut owing to the broken character of the ground, and twilight coming on\r\nbefore a proper disposition of his troops could be made, the attack was\r\npostponed until next morning. When morning dawned, however, it was found\r\nthat Sir Henry Clinton with his whole force had retreated during the\r\ndarkness of the night toward Sandy Hook, and Washington, on account of\r\nthe heat of the weather and the fatigue of his men, did not pursue them.\r\nThis was one of the most severely contested battles of the war. The\r\nAmerican loss was 227 killed and wounded, the English was a little\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n=Monomachy= (Fr. _monomachie_). A single combat, or the fighting of two,\r\nhand to hand.

The term is sometimes used\r\nto designate similar winds in other parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n=Mont St. Jean.= A village of Belgium; it is near the scene of the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, called by the French the battle of Mont St. Jean.\r\n\r\n=Montana Territory.= A Territory of the United States, which is bounded\r\non the north by the British possessions, east by Dakota, south by\r\nWyoming and Idaho, and west by Idaho. This Territory has been overrun by\r\nhostile Indians, who, under the management of the military, are being\r\nrapidly subjugated. It was formed into a separate Territory in May,\r\n1864, before which time it formed part of Idaho.\r\n\r\n=Montauban.= A town of France, capital of the department of\r\nTarn-et-Garonne, 342 miles south by west from Paris. At the Reformation\r\nthe people embraced the Protestant cause; and the town was ineffectually\r\nbesieged by the adverse party in 1580. It afterwards, in 1621, resisted\r\nfor three months the assaults of Louis XIII., and did not yield till\r\nafter the fall of Rochelle in 1629. The fortifications were soon after\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n=Montbéliard=, or =Montbélliard=. A town of France, in the department of\r\nDoubs, 48 miles northeast from Besançon. It was in former times a place\r\nof some strength, and the capital of a county that originally formed\r\npart of the kingdom of Burgundy, but was transferred to the Würtemberg\r\nfamily in 1395. Although twice taken by the French in the 17th century,\r\nit was not finally ceded to them till 1796.\r\n\r\n=Monte Aperto, Battle of.= See SIENA.\r\n\r\n=Monte-Baldo.= A mountain of Lombardy; the Austrians were defeated in\r\nits vicinity by the French in 1797.\r\n\r\n=Montebello Casteggio.= A village of Northern Italy, in the province of\r\nVoghera; here the Austrians were defeated by a French army under Gen.\r\nLannes, after a desperate conflict, June 9, 1800; in the last Italian\r\nwar the Austrians were again defeated here by the united armies of the\r\nFrench and Piedmontese in May, 1859.\r\n\r\n=Montemaggiore Belsito.= A town of the island of Sicily, 31 miles\r\nsoutheast of Palermo.

The Montenegrins are Slavs of the Servian race, knit together\r\nin clans and families, and have many fights among themselves, which are\r\nperpetuated by the hereditary obligation of avenging blood. Montenegro\r\nbelonged in the Middle Ages to the great Servian kingdom, but after the\r\ndismemberment of the latter, and its conquest by the Turks at the battle\r\nof Kossovo (1389), the Montenegrins, under their prince, who was of the\r\nroyal blood of Servia, maintained their independence, though compelled\r\nto relinquish the level tracts of land, and confine themselves to the\r\nmountains, in 1485. The Turks continued to assert their claims to\r\nMontenegro, but they were only defeated in their plans, and in 1710 the\r\nMontenegrins sought and obtained the protection of Russia, the czar\r\nagreeing to grant an annual subsidy on condition of their harassing the\r\nTurks by inroads. In 1860 the Montenegrins excited an insurrection\r\nagainst the Turkish rule in Herzegovina, which was soon suppressed, and\r\nin return they themselves were so hard pressed by the Turks that they\r\nwere glad to agree to a treaty (September 8, 1862) by which the\r\nsovereignty of the Porte over Montenegro was recognized.\r\n\r\n=Montenotte.= A small village of Northern Italy; here the Austrians were\r\ndefeated by the French under Bonaparte, April 12, 1796.\r\n\r\n=Monter= (_Fr._).

Gen. Taylor with an army of about\r\n6000 men, the first division under Gen. Worth, appeared before this\r\nplace, September 21, 1846. It was defended by a force of about 10,000\r\nMexicans under Gen. Ampudia. In approaching the city the first obstacles\r\nto be overcome were two batteries, which were in a commanding position.\r\nThese were soon taken and their guns turned on a third battery erected\r\nin a large stone building, called the Bishop’s Palace. This was stormed\r\non the morning of the 22d, and a vigorous sortie of the garrison having\r\nbeen repulsed, the Americans entered the city with the flying Mexicans.\r\nDuring the day a feigned attack on the defenses in front was soon\r\nconverted into a real one, and after a severe contest the Americans\r\nentered the city, though with great sacrifice of life; for every street\r\nwas barricaded, and guns were pointed from almost every wall. On the\r\nmorning of the 23d, the defenses on the opposite side were assaulted and\r\ncarried by the division of Gen. Worth, and the garrison soon after\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\n=Monterey.= A port of entry and capital of the county of the same name\r\nin California, about 95 miles south-southeast of San Francisco. It was\r\nonce a populous and thriving city, but has greatly declined since the\r\nrise of San Francisco. Being led to suppose that war existed between the\r\nUnited States and Mexico, Commodore Sloat took this place July 7, 1846,\r\nand raised the American flag without opposition.\r\n\r\n=Montero.= A military cap and hood formerly worn in camp.\r\n\r\n=Monterotondo.= A town of Central Italy, situated about 26 miles\r\nsouth-southwest of Rieti.

Montevideo was given up to Uruguay in 1828.\r\n\r\n=Montgomery.= The capital of the State of Alabama. A convention of\r\ndelegates from the Southern States met here February 4, 1861, to\r\norganize a provisional government for the seceded States, which were\r\nthereafter to be known as the Confederate States of America, and\r\nMontgomery was chosen as the seat of government. Richmond being\r\nafterwards made the capital of the Confederacy, the seat of government\r\nwas transferred thither on May 20 in the same year.\r\n\r\n=Montiel= (Spain), =Battle of=. Took place on March 14, 1369, between\r\nPeter the Cruel, king of Castile, and his brother, Henry of Transtamare,\r\naided by the French warrior, Bertrand du Guesclin.

See HALF-MOON.\r\n\r\n=Moors.= Formerly the natives of Mauritania (which see), but afterwards\r\nthe name given to the Numidians and others, and now applied to the\r\nnatives of Morocco and the neighborhood. They assisted Genseric and the\r\nVandals in the invasion of Africa, 429, and frequently rebelled against\r\nthe Roman emperors. They resisted for a time the progress of the Arab\r\nMohammedans, but were overcome in 707, and in 1019 by them introduced\r\ninto Spain, where their arms were long victorious. In 1063 they were\r\ndefeated in Sicily by Robert Guiscard. The Moorish kingdom of Granada\r\nwas set up in 1237, and lasted till 1492, when it fell before Ferdinand\r\nV. of Castile. The expulsion of the Moors from Spain was decreed by\r\nCharles V., but not fully carried into effect till 1609, when the\r\nbigotry of Philip III. inflicted this great injury on his country. About\r\n1518 the Moors established the piratical states of Algiers and Tunis.

Each pueblo is\r\nbuilt around a rectangular court, and is surrounded by a wall 15 feet\r\nhigh, the top of which forms a landing, upon which the doors of the\r\nhouses open. The exterior walls, which are of stone, have no openings,\r\nand would have to be scaled or battered down before access could be\r\ngained to the interior. The successive stories are set back, one behind\r\nthe other. The lower rooms are reached through trap-doors from the\r\nfirst landing; the latter is reached by means of detached ladders. The\r\nhouses are three rooms deep, and open from the interior court; the\r\narrangement is as strong and compact as could be well devised; but as\r\nthe court is common, and the landings are separated by no partitions, it\r\ninvolves a certain community of residence.\r\n\r\n=Morat.= An old town of Switzerland, situated on a lake of the same\r\nname, in the canton of Friburg. Charles the Bold of Burgundy was\r\ndefeated before Morat by the Swiss in 1476.\r\n\r\n=Moravia.= An Austrian province, occupied by the Slavonians about 458,\r\nand conquered by the Avars and Bohemians who submitted to Charlemagne.\r\nAbout 1000 it was subdued by Boleslas, king of Poland, but recovered by\r\nUlric of Bohemia in 1030. After various changes, Moravia and Bohemia\r\nwere amalgamated into the Austrian dominions in 1526. Moravia was\r\ninvaded by the Prussians in 1866.\r\n\r\n=Morea.= The name borne by the ancient Peloponnesus since the Middle\r\nAges, if not from as early a period as the 4th century; it forms the\r\nmost southern part of Greece. Morea was overrun by the Goths and\r\nVandals, and became a prey in the second half of the 8th century to\r\nbands of Slavic invaders, who found it wasted by war and pestilence.\r\nGradually, however, these barbarians were subdued and Grecianized by the\r\nByzantine emperors. In 1207 Morea was conquered by French knights; part\r\nof the country was reconquered in 1261 by the Byzantine emperor Michael\r\nVIII. Palæologus; but in 1460 the greater part of the Morea fell into\r\nthe hands of the Turks, who retained possession of it down to the period\r\nof the Greek revolution, except from 1687 to 1715, when it was held by\r\nthe Venetians.\r\n\r\n=Morella.= A strongly-fortified town of Spain, province of\r\nCastellon-de-la-Plana. It was taken by Philip V. in 1707, surprised in\r\n1838 by Cabrera, and retaken, after a brave defense, by Espartero in\r\n1840.

In 1051 it\r\nwas subdued for the Fatimite caliphs, by the Almaravides, who eventually\r\nextended their dominion into Spain. They were succeeded by the Almohades\r\n(1121), the Merinites (1270), and in 1516 by the Scherifs, pretended\r\ndescendants of Mohammed, the now reigning dynasty.

It was blown up by\r\nthe French in 1812.\r\n\r\n=Morris Island.= A low sand island, about 5 miles long, on the south\r\nside of Charleston harbor, S. C. A Confederate battery erected on its\r\nnorthern extremity aided in the capture of Fort Sumter, April 12-13,\r\n1861, after which Fort Wagner and other batteries were erected for the\r\ndefense of Charleston. An expedition against the city having been\r\ncontemplated, the military occupation of the island by the Federals, and\r\nthe erection of land-batteries for the reduction of Fort Sumter were\r\ndeemed necessary. As the latter was a task requiring engineering skill,\r\nthe duty was assigned to Gen. Q. A. Gillmore, who took command of the\r\ndepartment. He took possession of the south end of the island on July\r\n10, 1863, and on the 11th and 18th made two attempts to capture Fort\r\nWagner near the north end by assault, his object being to get within\r\nmore effective breaching distance of Fort Sumter. His efforts, however,\r\nwere unsuccessful, and it was accordingly determined to reduce Fort\r\nWagner by a regular siege. Gen. Gillmore commenced by the erection of\r\nparallels, which he pushed forward with such diligence in spite of all\r\ndifficulties, that by August 13 his works were within about 400 yards of\r\nWagner. On the morning of the 17th, having completed his batteries,\r\nwhich numbered about 60 pieces, and obtained the range, his guns opened\r\nfire on Sumter. The fleet, consisting of the frigate “Ironsides” and the\r\nmonitors, aided by some wooden gunboats, made an attack at the same time\r\nupon Fort Wagner and Fort Gregg, another Confederate work, both of\r\nwhich were nearly silenced. On August 26, having completed a parallel\r\nand sap which extended very close to Fort Wagner, Gen. Gillmore\r\ndetermined to possess a ridge of sand which interposed, and was\r\nnecessary to the success of his operations. It was constantly occupied\r\nby a strong body of the enemy’s pickets and at night by a force\r\nprotected by rifle-pits. A bombardment of the position was made just\r\nbefore dark, after which it was carried by the 24th Massachusetts, and\r\none company of North Carolina troops captured. After a terrific\r\nbombardment of forty-two hours, September 5-6, it was determined to\r\ncarry the place by storm on the next day, but during the night the enemy\r\nevacuated the fort, and Gen. Gillmore became master of the whole island.\r\n\r\n=Morris-pike.= An ancient Moorish pike.\r\n\r\n=Mortar.= Short cannon for throwing shells, usually fired at angles from\r\n45° to 60° elevation, called “vertical fire,” in contradistinction to\r\nthe fire of long cannon, usually made at low angles. Mortars--so called\r\nfrom their similarity of form to the mortar for pulverizing, which has\r\nretained its familiar shape from the earliest ages--are believed to have\r\nbeen the first guns used, and, though changed from age to age frequently\r\nin form of chamber, size, and projectile, all ages have found them too\r\nuseful in their special way to suppress or essentially alter them. The\r\n“Coehorn” mortar--so called from the famous Dutch engineer, Gen.\r\nCoehorn, who first proposed them in 1674--is to-day in use, of the same\r\npattern and for the like service then suggested. Monster mortars have\r\nbeen constructed from time to time, in the hope of producing immense\r\ndestruction in bombardments with single shells containing a large\r\nquantity of powder. The most recent of these, the monster mortar made by\r\nMallet for the British government, weighing 114,000 pounds, with a bore\r\nof 36 inches and a shell of 2912 pounds, failed to be of any service.\r\nPerhaps the most unique mortars ever made were to be found in the island\r\nof Malta in the last century. The solid rock had been hollowed out into\r\nimmense mortars, some of them 6 feet wide at the mouth. These tremendous\r\n_fougasses_ (the proper term for them) were to be filled with stones,\r\nshells, and missiles of various kinds, to descend in a crushing shower\r\nupon an enemy attempting a landing. For different kinds of mortars now\r\nin use, see ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n=Mortara.= A walled town of Italy, situated on the right bank of the\r\nArbogna, 14 miles south-southeast of Novara.

It\r\nwas entered by Napoleon I. and the French, September 14, 1812; the\r\ngovernor, Rostopchin, ordered it to be set on fire (11,840 houses burnt,\r\nbesides palaces and churches), September 15, 1812. It was evacuated by\r\nthe French in October, 1812.\r\n\r\n=Moskirch= (Baden).

It has been fortified from the earliest\r\nperiod of its history; in 1692 its defensive works were repaired and\r\nstrengthened by Coehorn; was taken in the following year by Louis XIV.\r\nand Vauban, the latter of whom added considerable to its original\r\nstrength; in 1695 it sustained a long siege against William III. of\r\nEngland, and was taken; seized by the French in the beginning of the\r\n18th century, but ceded to Austria in 1713. In 1781 the emperor Joseph\r\nexpelled the Dutch garrison. In 1792 it was occupied by the French, but\r\nretaken by the Austrians in 1793. In 1794 it was again occupied by the\r\nFrench, who kept it till the Netherlands were given up by the French\r\ngovernment in 1814; and after having been gallantly defended by its\r\nFrench conquerors in 1815, against the Prussians under Pirch, it was\r\nfinally restored to the Netherlands after the battle of Waterloo, and at\r\nonce put into thorough repair. The works were demolished again in 1866\r\nwith the exception of the citadel.\r\n\r\n=Nana.= In the East Indies, the title which is given to a chief of the\r\nMahrattas. It more properly signifies the acting head of the government,\r\nand general of the forces.\r\n\r\n=Nancy.= A city of France, the capital of the department of the Meurthe,\r\nsituated on the Meurthe, 30 miles south from Metz; it was the capital of\r\nLorraine and the residence of the dukes of that country in the 13th\r\ncentury. After taking Nancy, November 29, 1475, and losing it, October\r\n5, 1476, Charles the Bold of Burgundy was defeated and slain beneath its\r\nwalls by René II., duke of Lorraine, and the Swiss, January 5, 1477.\r\nNancy on the retreat of MacMahon’s army, and expecting the German army,\r\nsurrendered to four Uhlans, August 12, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Nankin=, =Nanking=, =Kianning-Foo=, or =Kiangning-Fu=. The ancient\r\ncapital of China, now the chief town of the province of Kiangsu, is\r\nsituated about 3 miles from the south bank of the river Yang-tse-Kiang,\r\nabout 100 miles from its mouth. On August 4, 1842, the British ships\r\narrived at Nankin, and were kept before this place till the final treaty\r\nof August 29, between China and Great Britain, was signed and ratified.\r\nThe rebel Tae-pings (Taipings) took it on March 19-20, 1853. It was\r\nrecaptured by the imperialists, July 19, 1864.\r\n\r\n=Nantes= (anc. _Condivicnum_, afterwards _Namnetes_, or _Nannetes_). An\r\nimportant commercial town of France, capital of the department of\r\nLoire-Inférieure, on the right bank of the Loire, about 30 miles from\r\nits mouth, 208 miles southwest of Paris. The history of Nantes reaches\r\nback to the time of the Romans, in whose hands it seems to have remained\r\nuntil the beginning of the 5th century, when they were driven from the\r\ntown. In 445 it valiantly withstood a siege of sixty days by the Huns.\r\nIt was captured by the Normans in 853 and 859, and held in possession by\r\nthem for nearly a century, after which the town suffered many\r\nsieges,--in 1343 by the English; in 1380 by the Earl of Buckingham, when\r\nit was relieved by Oliver of Clisson; and again in 1491 by Charles VIII.\r\nIt suffered much from the Vendéan civil war of 1793. In June of that\r\nyear the Vendéan army, 50,000 strong, under Cathelineau, laid siege to\r\nthe city, then defended by Gens. Beysser and Canclaux, but were repulsed\r\nwith great loss,--their general being among the slain. Here took place\r\nthe wholesale drowning (termed _Noyades_) of the royalists in the Loire,\r\nby command of the brutal Carrier, one of the leaders of the republicans,\r\nNovember, 1793. It was from Nantes that Prince Charles Edward embarked\r\nfor Scotland in 1745.\r\n\r\n=Nantes, Edict of.= The name given to the famous decree published in\r\nthat city by Henry IV. of France, April 13, 1598, which secured to the\r\nProtestant portion of his subjects freedom of religion.\r\n\r\n=Naples.= A province of Italy, occupying the southern part of the\r\nItalian peninsula, formerly the continental division of the old kingdom\r\nof the Two Sicilies. It began with a Greek colony named Parthenope\r\n(about 1000 B.C.), which was afterwards divided into Palæpolis (the\r\n_old_) and Neapolis (the _new_ city), from which latter the present name\r\nis derived. The colony was conquered by the Romans in the Samnite war,\r\n326 B.C. Naples, after resisting the power of the Lombards, Franks, and\r\nGermans, was subjugated by the Normans, under Roger Guiscard, king of\r\nSicily, in 1131. Naples was conquered by Theodoric the Goth in 493;\r\nretaken by Belisarius in 536; taken again by Totila in 543; retaken by\r\nNarses in 542; conquered, and the kingdom of the Two Sicilies founded by\r\nRoger Guiscard II. in 1131. Here occurred the massacre called the\r\nSicilian Vespers (which see), March 30, 1282. The territory was invaded\r\nby Louis, king of Hungary, in 1349; seized by Alphonso V. of Aragon in\r\n1435; conquered by Charles VIII. of France in 1494; and by Louis XII. of\r\nFrance and Ferdinand of Spain, who divided it in 1501. The French were\r\nexpelled from Naples in 1504; insurrection of Masaniello, occasioned by\r\nthe extortions of the Spanish viceroys, July, 1647; Masaniello slain by\r\nhis own followers a few days later; another insurrection suppressed by\r\nDon John of Austria, October, 1647. Naples was conquered by Prince\r\nEugène of Savoy for the emperor in 1706; the king flies on the approach\r\nof the French republicans, who establish the Parthenopean republic,\r\nJanuary 14, 1799; Nelson appears; Naples retaken June, 1799; the\r\nNeapolitans occupy Rome, September 30, 1799. Ferdinand is compelled to\r\nfly to Sicily, January 23, 1806; the French enter Naples, and Joseph\r\nBonaparte made king, February, 1806; Joachim Murat made king, July 15,\r\n1808; Joachim declares war against Austria, March 15, 1815; defeated at\r\nTolentino, May 3, 1815; successful insurrection of the Carbonari under\r\nGen. Pépé, July 13, 1820; the Austrians invade the kingdom; Gen. Pépé\r\ndefeated, March 7, 1821; insurrection of the Carbonari suppressed,\r\nAugust, 1828; great fighting in Naples; the liberals and the national\r\nguard almost annihilated by the royal troops, aided by the _lazzaroni_,\r\nMay 15, 1848; a martial anarchy prevails, 1849; Italian refugees, under\r\nCount Pisacane, land in Calabria, are defeated, and their leader killed,\r\nJune 27-July 2, 1857; insubordination among the Swiss troops at Naples,\r\nmany shot, July 7, 1859; Garibaldi lands in Sicily, May 11, 1860, and\r\ndefeats the Neapolitan army at Calatafimi, May 15, 1860; state of siege\r\nproclaimed at Naples, June 28, 1860; Garibaldi defeats Neapolitans at\r\nMelazzo, July 20; enters Messina, July 21, and the Neapolitans agree to\r\nevacuate Sicily, July 30, 1860; the army proclaim Count de Trani king,\r\nJuly 10, 1860; Garibaldi lands at Melito, August 18, 1860; takes Reggio,\r\nAugust 21, 1860; he enters Naples without troops, September 7, 1860;\r\nGaribaldi gives up the Neapolitan fleet to the Sardinian admiral\r\nPersano, September 11, 1860; repulses the Neapolitans at Cajazzo,\r\nSeptember 19, 1860, and defeats them at the Volturno, October 1, 1860;\r\nthe king of Sardinia enters the kingdom of Naples, and takes command of\r\nhis army, which combines with Garibaldi’s, October 11, 1860; Cialdini\r\ndefeats the Neapolitans at Isernia, October 17, and at Venafro, October\r\n18, 1860; Garibaldi meets Victor Emmanuel, and salutes him as king of\r\nItaly, October 26, 1860.\r\n\r\n=Naples= (Lat. _Neapolis_, It. _Napoli_). A city of Italy, the capital\r\nof the province of Naples, situated on the Bay of Naples, near the foot\r\nof Mount Vesuvius. In 1799 it was taken by the French, who evacuated it\r\nshortly after, but again occupied it in 1806. In 1848 it was plundered\r\nby the _lazzaroni_, of whom 1500 lost their lives. The history of this\r\ncity is nearly identical with that of the province of the same name\r\n(which see).\r\n\r\n=Napoleon Gun.= In 1856 it was proposed to increase the power of the\r\nlight, and diminish the weight of the heavy field artillery, by the\r\nintroduction of a single piece of medium weight and caliber; such is the\r\nnew field or Napoleon gun. It has no chamber, and should therefore be\r\nclassed as a gun. Its exterior is characterized by the entire absence of\r\nmolding and ornament, and in this respect may be at once distinguished\r\nfrom the old field-cannon. The first reinforce is cylindrical, and it\r\nhas no second reinforce, as the exterior tapers uniformly with the chase\r\nfrom the extremity of the first reinforce. The size of the trunnions and\r\nthe distance between the rimbases are the same as in the 24-pounder\r\nhowitzer, in order that pieces may be transported on the same kind of\r\ncarriage. The diameter of the bore is that of a 12-pounder, the length\r\nof bore is 16 calibers. The weight is 100 times the projectile, or 1200\r\npounds. The charge of powder is the same as for the heavy 12-pounders\r\n(pattern of 1840), or 2¹⁄₂ pounds for solid and case-shot, and 2 pounds\r\nfor canister-shot. It has, therefore, nearly as great range and accuracy\r\nas the heaviest gun of the old system, and, at the same time, the recoil\r\nand strain on the carriage are not too severe. The new gun and carriage\r\nweigh about 500 pounds more than the 6-pounder and carriage, still it\r\nhas been found to possess sufficient mobility for the general purposes\r\nof light artillery. It is proposed to retain the 12-pounder howitzer in\r\nservice, to be employed in cases where great celerity of movement is\r\nindispensable. The effect of this change is to simplify the _matériel_\r\nof field artillery, and to increase its ability to cope with the\r\nrifle-musket, principally by the use of larger and more powerful\r\nspherical case-shot. The principal objection to an increased caliber for\r\nlight field-guns is the increased weight of the ammunition, and\r\nconsequent reduction of the number of rounds that can be carried in the\r\nammunition-chests.\r\n\r\n=Narbonne.= A city of France, in the department of the Aude, 32 miles\r\neast of Carcassonne. The modern town of Narbonne occupies the site of\r\nthe ancient _Narbo Martius_, a Roman colony founded in 118 B.C. After\r\nthe first colonization of Narbo, many of the soldiers of Cæsar’s Tenth\r\nLegion were settled here, from whom the town derived the name of\r\n_Decumanorum Colonia_. It was taken by the Visigoths in 462, by the\r\nBurgundians in 508, by the Franks in 531, by the Saracens in 719, and by\r\nthe Moors in 779. Charles Martel defeated the Moors under its walls, but\r\nthe town held out until it was taken by Pepin in 759. In 859 it fell to\r\nthe arms of the Northmen.\r\n\r\n=Narisci.= A small but brave people in the south of Germany, of the\r\nSuevic race, dwelt west of the Marcomanni and east of the Hermunduri.\r\nTheir country extended from the Sudeti Montes on the north to the Danube\r\non the south.\r\n\r\n=Narni= (anc. _Narnia_). A town of Central Italy, on the Nera, or Nar,\r\nabout 45 miles northeast of Rome. During the second Punic war an army\r\nwas posted here to oppose the threatened advance of Hasdrubal upon Rome.\r\nThe town bore an important part in the civil war between Vitellius and\r\nVespasian. It was occupied by the generals of the former to check the\r\nadvance of Vespasian’s army, but the increasing disaffection towards\r\nVitellius caused the troops at Narnia to lay down their arms without\r\nresistance. Its natural strength and commanding position rendered it\r\nalso of great importance during the Gothic wars of Belisarius and\r\nNarses. The town was sacked by the Venetians and its garrison put to the\r\nsword in the 16th century, since which time it has been a place of\r\nlittle importance.\r\n\r\n=Narragansetts.= A tribe of Algonkin Indians who formerly inhabited a\r\ntract of country nearly corresponding to the present State of Rhode\r\nIsland. They were generally friendly to the early white settlers, and\r\nwere sworn enemies of the Mohegans (which see). In 1637, when the\r\nPequots were attempting to induce them to join in a general war upon the\r\nwhites, they were dissuaded from doing so by Roger Williams, who had\r\ngreat influence with their chief, Canonicus. In King Philip’s war (1675)\r\nthey were suspected of playing false to the settlers, and of sheltering\r\nthe enemy that wasted their settlements. It was accordingly resolved to\r\ntreat them as enemies, and 1000 colonists marched against their chief\r\nfort, which was situated on a swamp island near what is now the village\r\nof Kingston, R. I. The fort was taken by storm and burned, all the\r\nwinter supplies of the Indians and many of the aged and helpless, it is\r\nsaid, perishing in the flames. Hunger and distress followed; but the\r\nNarragansetts still maintained the contest under their chief, Canonchet,\r\nuntil he was taken prisoner and put to death. They subsequently merged\r\ninto the dominant race, and only a few of the tribe now exist.\r\n\r\n=Narva.= A town of Russia in Europe, in the government of St.\r\nPetersburg, on the Narova, 8 miles from its mouth, and 90 miles\r\nsouthwest from St. Petersburg. Near this town on November 30, 1700,\r\nCharles XII. at the head of 8000 Swedes, defeated Peter the Great with\r\nabout 80,000 Russians. It was taken by Peter in 1804.\r\n\r\n=Nasamones.= A powerful but savage Libyan people, who dwelt originally\r\non the shores of the Great Syrtis, but were driven inland by the Greek\r\nsettlers of Cyrenaica, and afterward by the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Naseby.= A parish and village of England, in the county of Northampton,\r\n12 miles north of the town of that name. The battle of Naseby, between\r\nCharles I. and the Parliamentary army under Fairfax and Cromwell, took\r\nplace here, June 14, 1645. It resulted in the total defeat of the\r\nroyalists, the king being compelled to flee, after losing his cannon and\r\nbaggage, and nearly 5000 of his army as prisoners.\r\n\r\n=Nashville.= A city and capital of the State of Tennessee, situated on\r\nthe left bank of the Cumberland River, about 200 miles from its mouth.\r\nDuring the civil war, after the fall of Fort Donelson, it was occupied\r\nby the Union forces, February 24, 1862. Within a few miles of the city\r\nwas fought the memorable battle which bears its name, between the\r\nConfederate forces under Gen. Hood and the Union troops under Gen.\r\nGeorge H. Thomas, December 15-16, 1864. The battle commenced by a feint\r\non Hood’s right and a real attack on his left, which resulted in driving\r\nit a distance of 8 miles, and the capture of over 1000 prisoners, 20\r\nwagons, and 16 pieces of artillery. During the ensuing night, Gen. Hood\r\ncontracted his lines, and next day the battle was renewed with vigor,\r\ntowards the afternoon becoming close and obstinate. Near dusk the\r\nConfederates gave way, and a total rout soon followed. Some 4000\r\nprisoners were captured, over 50 pieces of artillery, and an immense\r\nnumber of small-arms. On the 17th the pursuit of the enemy was continued\r\nand many more prisoners captured. Hood escaped with a mere wreck of his\r\narmy, and was soon after relieved of command.\r\n\r\n=Nasir-Jung= (_Ind._). Victorious, or triumphant in war.\r\n\r\n=Nassau, House of.= A noble family of German origin, which produced many\r\ngreat men, and derived its title from Nassau, on the Rhine. In the 16th\r\ncentury the family acquired the principality of Orange, in the southeast\r\nof France; after which the counts of Nassau took the title of Prince of\r\nOrange.\r\n\r\n=Natchez=, or =Natches=. A tribe of Indians who formerly occupied four\r\nor five villages situated east of the Mississippi in a tract of country\r\nwhich embraced the site of the city of that name. They were generally\r\nfriendly to the early French settlers; but in 1729, being enraged by the\r\nbrutal avarice of Chopart, the commander of the garrison, who demanded\r\nas a plantation the very site of their principal village, they concerted\r\na general massacre of the French, which they effected November 28,\r\nkilling about 200 and holding the women and children captives. The\r\nFrench took a bloody and terrible revenge. Under the leadership of Le\r\nSueur, a Frenchman, 700 Choctaws broke upon the slumbers of the Natchez\r\non the night of January 28, 1730, liberated the captives, and with a\r\nloss of but two of their number, brought off 60 scalps and 18 prisoners.\r\nOn February 8 following the French under Loubois completed the ruin of\r\nthe tribe. Some fled to the neighboring tribes and some crossed the\r\nMississippi to the vicinity of the Natchitoches. They were pursued and\r\ntheir places of refuge taken. Of the scattered remnants some remained\r\nwith the Chickasaws, others settled with the Muskogees, and about 400\r\nwere shipped to San Domingo and sold as slaves. Thus perished the\r\nNatchez as an independent tribe.\r\n\r\n=Natchitoches.= A tribe of Indians allied to the Caddos, who formerly\r\nlived on Red River, La. They were dispossessed of their territory by the\r\nfugitive Natchez in 1731, and settled permanently with the Caddos, with\r\nwhich tribe a few still exist.\r\n\r\n=National Armory.= See ARMORY, NATIONAL.\r\n\r\n=National Cemeteries.= In the United States, are the burial-places for\r\nsoldiers. They are called national because they belong to and are cared\r\nfor by the general government.\r\n\r\n=National Flag.= See FLAG.\r\n\r\n=National Guards.= The militia organizations of several States of the\r\nUnited States and of some foreign countries are so called. In the United\r\nStates they are authorized by State laws, and may be called into the\r\nservice of the general government. After the destruction of the Bastile,\r\na similar organization, called the _garde nationale_, was formed in\r\nParis from the bourgeois class in 1789, under Lafayette as\r\ncolonel-general. Napoleon subsequently defeated and dispersed it, but it\r\nwas again organized by him in 1814. The national guard was adopted as an\r\ninstitution under the Restoration, and the Comte d’Artois appointed\r\ncolonel-general. By decree of 1852 the government reserved the right of\r\norganizing or suppressing the national guard in _communes_, and also of\r\nnominating all the officers, who up to this time had been elected. The\r\nFrench national guard fought in the war of 1870-71, and also\r\nparticipated in the Communist struggles.\r\n\r\n=National Military Homes.= See SOLDIERS’ HOMES.\r\n\r\n=National Salute.= In the United States, a salute of one gun for each\r\nState in the Union.\r\n\r\n=National Troops.= Are those raised under the authority of Congress, in\r\ncontradistinction to the militia, which may be called State troops,\r\nbeing organized by the several States.\r\n\r\n=Native Cavalry.= A body of natives in the East Indian army, formed into\r\nlight dragoons.\r\n\r\n=Native Infantry.= A body of native troops in the East Indian army.\r\n\r\n=Natural Angle of Sight.= The angle which the natural line of sight\r\nmakes with the axis of the piece.\r\n\r\n=Natural Fortification.= See FORTIFICATION.\r\n\r\n=Natural Line of Sight.= See LINE OF METAL.\r\n\r\n=Natural Steel.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR, STEEL.\r\n\r\n=Naumburg.= A town of Prussia, province of Saxony, 18 miles\r\nsouth-southwest from Merseburg. It was besieged in 1482 by the Hussites\r\nunder Procopius; but they were induced to raise the siege by the\r\nentreaties of the children of the town. Naumburg was a place of\r\nimportance in the Thirty Years’ War, as well as in the campaigns of 1806\r\nand 1813.\r\n\r\n=Nauplia.= A small fortified town and seaport in the Morea, Greece. At\r\nan early period it was the port and arsenal of Argos; occupied by the\r\nVenetians in the 13th century; taken by the Turks in 1540, and again in\r\n1715. The Turks lost it on the outbreak of the Greek insurrection.\r\n\r\n=Navajo Indians.= A numerous and warlike tribe of the Shoshone family,\r\nwho are located to the number of about 12,000 on a large reservation in\r\nNew Mexico. They were for a long time at war with the whites, but have\r\nat length been thoroughly subdued, and are gradually adopting\r\nsemi-civilized habits. They are famous for the manufacture of a peculiar\r\nblanket of excellent quality which bears their name.\r\n\r\n=Naval Camp.= In military antiquities, a fortification, consisting of a\r\nditch and parapet on the land side, or a wall built in the form of a\r\nsemicircle, and extended from one point of the sea to the other. This\r\nwas beautified with gates, and sometimes defended with towers, through\r\nwhich they issued forth to attack their enemies. Towards the sea, or\r\nwithin it, they fixed great piles of wood, like those in their\r\nartificial harbors; before these the vessels of burden were placed in\r\nsuch order, that they might serve instead of a wall, and give protection\r\nto those without; in this manner Nicias is reported by Thucydides to\r\nhave encamped himself. When their fortifications were thought strong\r\nenough to defend them from the assaults of enemies, the ancients\r\nfrequently dragged their ships on shore. Around these ships the soldiers\r\ndisposed their tents, as appears everywhere in Homer. But this seems\r\nonly to have been practiced in winter, when their enemy’s fleet was laid\r\nup, and could not assault them; or in long sieges, and when they lay in\r\nno danger from their enemies by sea, as in the Trojan war, where the\r\ndefenders of Troy never once attempted to encounter the Grecians in a\r\nsea-fight.\r\n\r\n=Naval Crown.= In heraldry, a rim of gold, round which are placed\r\nalternately prows of galleys and square-sails. A naval crown supporting\r\nthe crest in place of the wreath, occurs in various grants of arms in\r\nthe early part of the present century to naval heroes. The crest of the\r\nEarl of St. Vincent, bestowed on him after his victory over the Spanish\r\nfleet in 1797, is issuing out of a naval crown or, enwrapped by a wreath\r\nof laurel vert, a demi-pegasus argent maned and hoofed of the first,\r\nand winged azure, charged in the wing with a fleur-de-lis or.\r\n\r\n=Navarre.= A province, and formerly a kingdom, of Spain, is bounded on\r\nthe north by France, on the south and east by Aragon, and on the west by\r\nthe Biscays. It was occupied in ancient times by the Vascones, who were\r\nsubdued by the Goths in the 5th century: After having become gradually\r\namalgamated with their conquerors, the people continued to enjoy a\r\nspecies of turbulent independence under military leaders until the 8th\r\ncentury, when they were almost annihilated by the hordes of Arabs who\r\nwere rapidly spreading their dominion to all parts of the peninsula.\r\nNavarre was conquered from the Saracens by Charlemagne, 778. In 1076,\r\nSancho Ramorez of Aragon seized Navarre. During the war of independence\r\nand the civil war, the province produced bands of formidable\r\nguerrilleros.\r\n\r\n=Nave.= In gun-carriages, that part of a wheel in which the arms of the\r\naxle-tree move, and in which the spokes are driven and supported.\r\n\r\n=Nave-boxes.= Are boxes which are placed in the naves; they were\r\nformerly made of brass, but experience has shown that those of cast iron\r\ncause less friction, and are much cheaper. There are two, one at each\r\nend, to diminish the friction of the axle-tree against the nave.\r\n\r\n=Nave-hoops.= Are flat iron rings to bind the nave; there are generally\r\nthree on each nave.\r\n\r\n=Navel.= A lug with a hole through it on the under side of a carronade,\r\nused to connect it with its carriage.\r\n\r\n=Naxos=, or =Naxia=. An island in the Ægean Sea, and the largest of the\r\nCyclades; is situated nearly half-way between the coasts of Greece and\r\nAsia Minor. It was conquered by Pisistratus, who established Lydamis as\r\ntyrant of the island about 540 B.C. The Persians in 501 attempted, at\r\nthe suggestion of Aristagoras, to subdue Naxos, but failed; Aristagoras,\r\nfearing punishment, induced the Ionian cities to revolt from Persia. In\r\n490 the Persians, under Datis and Artaphernes, conquered Naxos, and\r\nreduced the inhabitants to slavery. The Naxians recovered their\r\nindependence after the battle of Salamis (480). They were the first of\r\nthe allied states whom the Athenians reduced to subjection, 471. After\r\nthe capture of Constantinople by the Latins in 1204, the Ægean Sea fell\r\nto the lot of the Venetians; and Marco Sanudo in 1207 took possession of\r\nNuxos, and founded there a powerful state under the title of duchy of\r\nthe Ægean Sea. His dynasty ruled over the greater part of the Cyclades\r\nfor 360 years, and was at length overthrown by the Turks in 1566. Naxos\r\nnow belongs to the kingdom of Greece.\r\n\r\n=Naxos.= A Greek city on the eastern coast of Sicily, south of Mount\r\nTaurus; was founded 735 B.C. by the Chalcidians of Eubœa, and was the\r\nfirst Greek colony established in the island. It carried on a\r\nsuccessful war against Messina, and was subsequently an ally of the\r\nAthenians against Syracuse. In 403 the town was taken by Dionysius of\r\nSyracuse, and destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Nebraska.= One of the Central States of the United States, lying west\r\nof the Missouri River. Nebraska formed a part of the great grant of the\r\nMississippi Valley to Crozart in 1712, and was part of the territory\r\nincluded in Law’s celebrated Mississippi scheme. It came into possession\r\nof the United States in 1803, as a portion of the Louisiana purchase. In\r\n1804, Lewis and Clarke explored the interior and western parts of the\r\nState. In 1854 it was erected into a Territory, and in 1867 admitted as\r\na State.\r\n\r\n=Necessaries.= The articles issued to the British soldier, such as\r\nboots, shirts, stockings, razor, etc., which are requisite for his\r\ncomfort and cleanliness, are technically termed regimental necessaries.\r\nNon-commissioned officers are not allowed to sell regimental necessaries\r\nto the soldiers. Every article is directed by the regulations to be\r\nmarked with the owner’s name, the letter of his company, and the number\r\nof his regiment; and the sale or injury of them renders him liable to be\r\ntried by court-martial and punished.\r\n\r\n=Neck.= The elbow or part connecting the blade and socket of a bayonet.\r\n\r\n=Neck Line.= An old term in fortification signifying the gorge.\r\n\r\n=Neck of a Cascabel.= The part joining the knob to the base of the\r\nbreech.\r\n\r\n=Neck of a Gun.= The small part of the piece in front of the chase.\r\n\r\n=Needle.= A slender bar of steel, usually pointed, and resting on a\r\nvertical pivot, in a mariner’s, or other compass, so as to turn freely\r\ntowards the magnetic poles of the earth by virtue of the magnetic\r\npolarity with which it has been artificially endued; called also the\r\n_magnetic needle_.\r\n\r\n=Needle-Gun= (Ger. _Zundnadelgewehr_). Is a breech-loading gun, so\r\nconstructed that by pulling the trigger a stout needle or wire is thrust\r\nthrough the base of the cartridge, parallel with its axis, into the\r\ndetonating charge behind the ball, causing explosion and the ignition of\r\nthe cartridge. This gun was the regulation arm of the German infantry\r\nuntil it was replaced by the Mauser, a gun somewhat similar. The gun was\r\ninvented by Nicolaus Dreyse, of Sömmerda, Prussia, where it is\r\nmanufactured. It was first used by the Prussians in 1848, and again in\r\nthe Italian war of 1866, when it proved a fearful instrument of\r\ndestruction, and to it may be ascribed in a great measure the success of\r\nits employers.\r\n\r\n=Neemuch.= In Hindostan, a town with a British cantonment, in the\r\nterritory of Gwalior, or possessions of Scindia. The native troops\r\nstationed at this place participated in the general mutiny of the Bengal\r\narmy. The rising took place on the night of June 3, 1857, when a\r\ngeneral massacre of the Europeans took place. The work of slaughter was\r\ncommenced by the artillery, and all the native troops joined heartily in\r\nit. A native officer opened the gate of the fort and gave entrance to\r\nthe rebels. Having committed the most frightful enormities, and outraged\r\nevery law of humanity, a large body of the miscreants marched in the\r\ndirection of Agra.\r\n\r\n=Neerwinden.= A village of Belgium, in the province of Liège. William\r\nIII. of England was defeated by the Duke of Luxemburg between this place\r\nand Landen in 1693; the French were also defeated here in 1793 by the\r\nAustrians.\r\n\r\n=Neeshungpat= (_Ind._). A violent assault without bloodshed.\r\n\r\n=Negapatam.= A considerable seaport in the south of India, and province\r\nof Tanjore. In 1660 it was taken from the Portuguese by the Dutch. It\r\nwas a very flourishing city in 1781, when it was besieged and taken by\r\nthe British with about 4000 troops, and finally ceded to them at the\r\npeace of 1783.\r\n\r\n=Negative.= This term is sometimes used to express the result of\r\nmeasures or enterprises which, though not entirely successful, are not\r\nproductive of serious or mischievous consequences. Hence the British\r\nexpeditions to Spain and Walcheren may be considered as having had\r\nnegative success.\r\n\r\n=Negative Penalty.= Deprived of command; a bar to indulgence; a\r\nreprimand; etc.\r\n\r\n=Neglect of Duty.= Is total omission or disregard of any prescribed\r\nservice, or unsoldier-like execution, which is punishable at the\r\ndiscretion of a court-martial. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 62.\r\n\r\n=Negrais.= An island, harbor, and cape of the Eastern Peninsula,\r\nsituated on the southwest extremity of the kingdom of Pegu. In 1687 a\r\nsettlement was founded here by the British; it was soon after abandoned;\r\nagain occupied by the British in 1751; it was attacked by the Burmese in\r\n1759, and nearly all the inhabitants were put to death.\r\n\r\n=Negropont.= See CHALCIS.\r\n\r\n=Nelli-Cotah.= A fort situated about 40 miles to the south of\r\nTinnevelly, East Indies. This fort has been rendered memorable by the\r\nmanner in which it was carried by the English in 1755, and the barbarity\r\nwith which the garrison was treated which had not killed a man and had\r\ncalled for quarter, and yet men, women, and children, to the number of\r\nabout 400, were massacred.\r\n\r\n=Nepaul=, or =Nipal=. An extensive country of Hindostan. It is said to\r\nhave been completely subdued in 1323 by Hurr Singh, one of the princes\r\nof Oude, who was driven out of his own possessions by the Patans.\r\nRunjeet Mull was the last of the Surya Bansi race that reigned in\r\nNepaul. He formed an alliance with Purthi Nirain, which ended in the\r\nloss of his dominions, of which he was stripped by his ally in 1768. It\r\nwas in his reign that Capt. Kinloch with a British force endeavored to\r\npenetrate into Nepaul, but from the sickness of the troops, and the\r\ndifficulty of the country, the enterprise was abandoned. In 1790 the\r\nNepaul government became involved in a war with the emperor of China,\r\nwho sent against them an army of 70,000 men, and defeated the Nepaulese\r\nin repeated battles. A peace was at last concluded, though on terms\r\nignominious to the Nepaulese, who were compelled to become tributaries\r\nto the Chinese. In the year 1814 the British commenced a war against the\r\nNepaulese, and, after a long and arduous struggle, during which the\r\nBritish suffered a number of reverses, the Nepaulese were compelled to\r\nsue for peace.\r\n\r\n=Nervii.= A nation of Gallia Belgica, whose territory was situated north\r\nof the Ambiani. On receiving intelligence that Cæsar was advancing into\r\ntheir country, the inhabitants sent away their old men, women, and\r\nchildren to a place of refuge among the marshes by the sea-shore, and\r\nposted themselves in ambush on the banks of the Sabis (_Sambre_). The\r\ninvaders had approached to the place of concealment, and, unsuspicious\r\nof any danger, were engaged in forming a camp, when they suddenly found\r\nthemselves attacked by 60,000 fierce barbarians. The Romans would have\r\nbeen immediately routed, had not the invincible genius of Cæsar been\r\nthere to sway and turn the tide of battle. After a hard-fought contest,\r\nthe Nervian forces were almost annihilated; but the Nervii were not yet\r\nsubdued. In 54 B.C. they assisted the Eburones in the unsuccessful\r\nattack upon the camp of Quintus Cicero; and it was not until the\r\nfollowing year that they finally submitted to the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Neshaumburdar= (_Ind._). An ensign.\r\n\r\n=Netherlands, Kingdom of the.= A country in the northwest of Europe. The\r\nname of the Netherlands was, for several centuries, applied to the\r\ncountries which now form the kingdoms of Belgium and the Netherlands and\r\npart of the north of France. The greater portion of this territory was\r\nheld by the Spaniards until Marlborough, the general in command of the\r\nallied forces, gained the memorable victory of Ramilies in 1706. After\r\nthis, Brussels, the capital, and great part of these provinces\r\nacknowledged Charles VI., afterwards emperor of Germany, for their\r\nsovereign. They were held by the German house until the war of 1741,\r\nwhen the French made an entire conquest of them, except part of the\r\nprovince of Luxemburg. They were restored, however, by the peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, in the year 1748. In 1794 Holland was overrun by the\r\ntroops of the French republic, and annexed to the French empire in 1810,\r\nafter having been formed into the Batavian republic, and subsequently\r\ninto a kingdom under Louis Bonaparte. In 1814 the royal family of\r\nHolland was restored, and two years after Holland and Belgium were once\r\nmore reunited under the common title of the Netherlands; but in 1830\r\nBelgium became a distinct kingdom. See BELGIUM, HOLLAND, and FLANDERS.\r\n\r\n=Netley, Royal Victoria Hospital at.= Is a superb building on the shore\r\nof Southampton Water, Hants, England, for the reception of invalids from\r\nthe army on foreign service, and from among the troops serving in the\r\nadjoining military districts. In times of peace, it is only necessary to\r\nuse a portion of the vast structure; but in the event of a European war,\r\nin which the British army should take part, the exigencies of the\r\nservice would probably tax its accommodation to the utmost. There is\r\nprovision for 1000 patients, with power to increase the number. The\r\nestablishment has a complete medical staff. Netley is also the\r\nheadquarters of the female nurses of the army, who are under the control\r\nof a lady stationed here as superintendent-general. Complete\r\narrangements have been made for the landing of wounded men in front of\r\nthe hospital, and for conveying them thither with the least disturbance.\r\nSee MEDICAL SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n=Nettoyer les Magazins= (_Fr._). In artillery, signifies to remove the\r\ndifferent pieces of ordnance, for the purpose of having them carefully\r\nexamined, etc., and to have the stores and ammunition so arranged as not\r\nto receive damage.\r\n\r\n=Nettoyer les Tranchées= (_Fr._). To scour or clear the trenches. This\r\nis effected by means of a vigorous sally which the garrison of a\r\nbesieged place make upon the besiegers; when they beat in the guard,\r\ndrive off the workmen, level the parapet, break up and choke the line of\r\ncircumvallation, and spike or nail the cannon.\r\n\r\n=Neusatz.= A town of Hungary, on the Danube, opposite Peterwardein. On\r\nJune 11, 1849, it was taken from the Hungarian insurgents by the\r\nimperial troops, and was almost wholly destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Neutral.= Not engaged on either side; not taking part with either of\r\ncontending parties; neuter.\r\n\r\n=Neutral.= A person or nation that takes no part in a contest between\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n=Neutral Powers.= By the treaty of Paris, signed by the representatives\r\nof Great Britain, France, Austria, Russia, Prussia, Turkey, and\r\nSardinia, on April 16, 1856, it was determined that privateering should\r\nbe abolished; that neutrals might carry an enemy’s goods not contraband\r\nof war; that neutral goods not contraband were free even under an\r\nenemy’s flag; and that blockades to be binding must be effective. The\r\nPresident of the United States acceded to these provisions in 1861.\r\n\r\n=Neutrality.= In international law, the state of a nation which takes no\r\npart between two or more other nations at war with each other.\r\nNeutrality consists in the observance of a strict and honest\r\nimpartiality, so as not to afford advantage in the war to either party;\r\nand particularly in so far restraining its trade to the accustomed\r\ncourse, which is held in time of peace, as not to render assistance to\r\none of the belligerents in escaping the effects of the other’s\r\nhostilities. Even a loan of money to one of the belligerent parties is\r\nconsidered a violation of neutrality. A fraudulent neutrality is\r\nconsidered as no neutrality.\r\n\r\n=Neutrality, Armed.= See ARMED.\r\n\r\n=Nevada.= One of the Pacific States of the United States. Nevada is a\r\npart of the territory ceded to the United States by Mexico in 1848. It\r\nwas at first a part of California Territory; it was subsequently\r\nattached to Utah; in March, 1861, was organized as a Territory; and on\r\nOctober 31, 1864, was admitted as a State.\r\n\r\n=Nevers.= A town of France, the capital of the department of Nièvre,\r\nsituated on the right bank of the Loire, 153 miles south-southeast from\r\nParis. The town is ancient, and is mentioned by Cæsar under the name of\r\nNoviodunum. Here that general, in 52 B.C., fixed his headquarters, and\r\nhere he left his hostages, supplies, baggage, and military-chest. After\r\nhis defeat at Gergovia, the people of Noviodunum rose against the\r\nRomans, massacred all of them who were in the town, and plundered the\r\nstores.\r\n\r\n=Neville’s Cross= (or Durham), =Battle of=. Fought between the Scots\r\nunder King David Bruce, and the English under Philippa, consort of\r\nEdward III., and Lord Percy, October 12 or 17, 1346. More than 15,000 of\r\nthe Scots were slain, and their king taken prisoner.\r\n\r\n=Nevis=, or =Nievis=. One of the West India Islands, belonging to Great\r\nBritain, and separated from the south extremity of St. Christopher by a\r\nchannel about 2 miles in width. It was taken by the French February 14,\r\n1782; restored to the English in 1783.\r\n\r\n=Newark.= A town of England, in Nottinghamshire, on the Newark River, 16\r\nmiles northeast from Nottingham. Here, in the midst of troubles, died\r\nKing John, October 9, 1216; here the royal army under Prince Rupert\r\nrepulsed the army of the Parliament, besieging the town, March 21, 1644;\r\nand here, May 5, 1646, Charles I., after his defeat at Naseby, put\r\nhimself into the hands of the Scotch army, who afterwards gave him up to\r\nhis enemies.\r\n\r\n=Newbury.= A town of England, in Berkshire, on the Kennet, 15 miles\r\nsouthwest from Reading. Near here were fought two desperate battles: (1)\r\nOn September 20, 1643, between the army of Charles I. and that of the\r\nParliament under Essex; it terminated somewhat favorably for the king.\r\n(2) A second battle of dubious result was fought between the royalists\r\nand the Parliamentarians, October 27, 1644.\r\n\r\n=New Caledonia.= An island of the South Pacific Ocean, discovered by\r\nCook on September 4, 1774; seized by the French September 20, 1853. The\r\nFrench government in December, 1864, redressed the outrages committed on\r\nBritish missionaries at a station established here in 1854.\r\n\r\n=Newcastle-upon-Tyne.= A river-port and the chief town of the county of\r\nNorthumberland, England, 14 miles north from Durham. The Romans had a\r\nstationary camp here, called _Pons Ælii_, one of the chain of forts by\r\nwhich the Wall of Hadrian was fortified. Newcastle surrendered to the\r\nScotch in 1646, who here gave up Charles I. to the Parliament in 1646.\r\nThe town occupied by Gen. Wade in 1745.\r\n\r\n=New England.= The name given by Capt. John Smith, in 1614, to the\r\nterritory granted by James I. to the Plymouth Company for colonization,\r\nwhich now comprises the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. For history of New\r\nEngland, see these States under appropriate headings.\r\n\r\n=Newfoundland.= A large island of British North America, at the mouth of\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence. Newfoundland is supposed to have been\r\ndiscovered by the Norwegians, or Northmen, about the year 1000; it was\r\nrediscovered by John Cabot on June 24, 1497; a settlement was\r\nsubsequently formed here by some Portuguese adventurers, who were in\r\ntheir turn expelled by Sir Francis Drake in the reign of Elizabeth.\r\nAfter this period numerous English colonies were established from time\r\nto time along the east coast, and several French along the south coast,\r\nin the Bay of Placentia. The French often tried to conquer the island,\r\nand during the French and English wars it was the scene of many bloody\r\nevents. In 1713, Newfoundland and its dependencies were declared, by the\r\ntreaty of Utrecht, to belong wholly to Great Britain; the French\r\nreserving a right to fish on certain parts of the coast. In 1728 the\r\nisland was made a province of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n=New Grenada= (now _United States of Colombia_). A republic in the\r\nnorthwest of South America, discovered by Ojeda in 1499, and settled by\r\nthe Spaniards in 1536. It formed a part of the new republic of Bogota,\r\nestablished in 1811, and combined with Caracas, formed the republic of\r\nColombia, December 17, 1819. (See COLOMBIA, UNITED STATES OF.) A\r\nstruggle took place between the conservative partisans of the old\r\ngovernment and the liberals, January, 1861, and Gen. Mosquera (liberal)\r\ndeposed Ospina and seized the government, July 18, 1861. Mosquera\r\ninvited Venezuela and Ecuador to join the confederation, August, 1863;\r\nEcuador declined, which resulted in a war, which commenced November 20,\r\n1863. The troops of Ecuador were defeated, December 6; peace ensued, and\r\nEcuador remained independent, December 30, 1863; Mosquera declared\r\nhimself dictator, by a _coup d’état_, March 11, 1866; he was deposed by\r\nSantos Acosta, May 23, 1867; Gen. Ponce was made provisional president,\r\nJuly, 1868, and was succeeded by Correoso, August 29, who defeated his\r\nopponents, November 12, 1868.\r\n\r\n=New Hampshire.= One of the Eastern States, and one of the original\r\nthirteen of the American Confederacy. New Hampshire was first visited in\r\n1614, and was settled near Portsmouth in 1623. It was several times\r\nconnected with Massachusetts up to 1679, when it became a royal\r\nprovince, but renewed its connections with Massachusetts in 1689, and\r\nwas for a short time attached to New York; finally, in 1741, it became\r\nan entirely separate province, and so remained till the Revolution. New\r\nHampshire was much harassed by the Indians, and in 1689 a party of them\r\nsacked Dover, killed many of the whites, and burnt the town. No\r\nimportant action took place on the soil of this State, either in the war\r\nof the Revolution or that of 1812. The State contributed greatly to the\r\ncause of the Union in the late civil war.\r\n\r\n=New Jersey.= One of the Middle Atlantic States, and one of the original\r\nthirteen of the American Confederacy. Settlements were made at Bergen,\r\nin New Jersey, soon after their arrival in New York, by the Dutch,\r\nbetween the years 1614 and 1624. The whole of the region lying between\r\nthe Delaware and the Hudson was claimed by them, although the Swedes had\r\nmade some settlements in the western part of the same country. These\r\nclaims, however, were disregarded by the British; and in 1664, Charles\r\nII. granted to the Duke of York the whole of this country, and in the\r\nsame year the duke sold it to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, in\r\nhonor of the latter of whom, a native of Jersey, it received the name\r\nwhich it still bears. The Dutch again got possession of it in 1673, but\r\nresigned it on the conclusion of peace in the following year. New Jersey\r\nescaped the inroads of the savage tribes which desolated and afflicted\r\nmost of the older colonies; but in the war of the Revolution it suffered\r\ngreatly, and was the scene of many important battles, such as Trenton,\r\nPrinceton, Millstone, Red Bank, and Monmouth. In the late civil war, New\r\nJersey contributed greatly to the cause of the Union, and her regiments\r\nwere distinguished on many important battle-fields.\r\n\r\n=New Matter= (in military courts). Should either party, in the course of\r\ntheir examination of witnesses, or by bringing forward new ones for that\r\npurpose, introduce new matter, the opposite one has the right of calling\r\nother witnesses to rebut such new matter. A prosecutor, however, cannot\r\nbe allowed to bring forward evidence to rebut what has been elicited by\r\nhis own cross-examination, but must be confined to new matter introduced\r\nby the accused, and supported by the examination-in-chief of the\r\naccused. The court should be very circumspect to see and prevent new\r\nmatter from being introduced, either in the prosecution or defense. But\r\nthe accused may urge in his defense mitigating circumstances, or examine\r\nwitnesses as to character or service, and produce testimonials of such\r\nfacts, without its being considered new matter; and if any point of law\r\nbe raised, or any matter requiring explanation, the judge-advocate may\r\nexplain; no other reply is admitted.\r\n\r\n=New Mexico.= A Territory of the United States, bounded on the north by\r\nColorado, east by Texas, south by Texas and Mexico, and west by Arizona.\r\nThe country was explored by the Spaniards in 1537, and was taken\r\npossession of by the viceroy of Mexico in the name of the king of Spain\r\ntowards the latter part of that century. About 1680, the natives, who\r\nwere an industrious people of Aztec race, provoked by the oppression of\r\ntheir rulers, rose against them and succeeded in driving them from the\r\ncountry. The Spaniards, however, soon regained their foothold, which\r\nthey succeeded in maintaining until 1822, when Mexico and its\r\ndependencies threw off the yoke of Spain. In 1846, Gen. Kearney captured\r\nSanta Fé, the capital of New Mexico, and soon after became master of the\r\nwhole Territory, which was ceded to the United States in 1848, and in\r\n1850 organized as a Territory. In 1854 another portion of Mexican\r\nterritory gained by purchase was added to it, and subsequently the\r\nTerritory of Arizona was set off from it, and another portion added to\r\nColorado. During the civil war New Mexico was the theatre of some\r\ndesperate and hard-fought battles. On February 21, 1862, a Confederate\r\nforce of Texans about 2500 strong, under Gen. Sibley, defeated the Union\r\nforces under Col. Canby at Valverde, about 10 miles from Fort Craig, and\r\ncaptured their guns. The loss of his battery compelled Col. Canby to\r\nfall back to Fort Craig, but the enemy was so crippled that he did not\r\nattempt to follow, but proceeded to Albuquerque and Santa Fé, both of\r\nwhich towns were evacuated by the Union troops. Soon afterwards a force\r\nof 400 Texans going north to reinforce Gen. Sibley were captured by Col.\r\nCanby. On March 26, 1862, an engagement took place at Apache Pass, in\r\nwhich 100 Texans were captured, between 300 and 400 killed, and 50\r\nwagons burned. Another engagement took place on the 28th, at Pigeon’s\r\nRanche, 25 miles north of Santa Fé, in which the Confederates lost more\r\nprisoners. About the middle of April, Col. Canby concentrating his\r\nforces attacked the Texans at Parillo, on the Rio Grande, and after a\r\nshort action defeated them with great slaughter, and compelled them to\r\nfly to the mountains. From this point until they reached Fort Bliss,\r\nTexas, their retreat was a succession of disasters. They left in New\r\nMexico more than one-half of their original number as killed, wounded,\r\nor prisoners, and every place which they abandoned in their retreat was\r\nimmediately occupied by Union troops.\r\n\r\n=New Model.= In the United States, all cannon made since 1861 are on the\r\nnew model. This is characterized by the absence of all ornament on the\r\nexterior,--the outline is made up of gentle curves as far us\r\npossible,--on the inside the bottom of the bore is a semi-ellipsoid.\r\n\r\n=New Orleans.= Capital of the State of Louisiana, and commercial\r\nmetropolis of the Gulf States. It was founded in 1718 by Bienville, the\r\ngovernor of the province of Louisiana under the French, who caused it to\r\nbe laid out, and levees built, under the direction of the engineer De la\r\nTour. On January 8, 1815, was fought the battle of New Orleans, a few\r\nmiles below the city, between Gen. Andrew Jackson at the head of the\r\nAmerican forces, and the British under Gen. Pakenham, ending in the\r\ndefeat of the latter with a loss in killed and wounded of nearly 3000\r\nmen. The American loss was but 13. In the late civil war, New Orleans\r\nheld out until 1862, when it surrendered to the Union forces. Gen.\r\nButler was placed in command, but on December 16, 1862, was relieved by\r\nGen. Banks.\r\n\r\n=New Ross.= A town in Wexford Co., Southeast Ireland, where Gen.\r\nJohnston totally defeated the insurgent Irish under Beauchamp D. Bagenal\r\nHarvey, June 4, 1798.\r\n\r\n=Newry.= A town in Down Co., Ireland, which was reduced to a ruinous\r\ncondition in the rebellion of 1641; it was surprised by Sir Con.\r\nMagenis, but was retaken by Lord Conway. After the restoration the town\r\nwas rebuilt. It was burnt by the Duke of Berwick when flying from\r\nSchomberg and the English army, and only the castle and a few houses\r\nescaped, 1689.\r\n\r\n=Newtown-Butler.= A town in Fermanagh Co., Ireland, where, on July 30,\r\n1689, the Enniskilleners under Gustavus Hamilton thoroughly defeated the\r\nadherents of James II. commanded by Gen. Maccarty, whom they captured\r\nwith his artillery, arms, and baggage.\r\n\r\n=New Trial.= The privilege of a new trial does not seem to be denied.\r\nThe provisions therefore are borrowed from common law, and are not held,\r\nin either civil or military tribunals, to preclude the accused from\r\nhaving a second trial on his own motion. Officers who sat on the first\r\ntrial should not be detailed for the new trial; they have formed and\r\nexpressed opinions. New, or second trial, can only be authorized where\r\nthe sentence adjudged upon the first trial has been disapproved. After a\r\nsentence has been duly approved and has taken effect, the granting of a\r\nnew trial is beyond the power of a military commander, or the President.\r\n\r\n=New York.= One of the Middle States of the United States, and one of\r\nthe thirteen of the original confederation. The earliest explorations of\r\nNew York by Europeans were in 1609, by Hendrik Hudson, who took\r\npossession of the country on the river which bears his name for the\r\nDutch, and by Champlain, a Frenchman, who explored Lake Champlain from\r\nCanada. The English, however, claimed the right of prior discovery,\r\nwhich led to frequent conflicts. The first white settlements were made\r\nin the State in 1713, and the early settlers suffered greatly from\r\nIndian depredations. In 1690, Schenectady was taken and burned by the\r\nsavages, and many of the inhabitants massacred. The massacre of the\r\ngarrison at Fort William Henry by the Indians in 1757 will long be\r\nremembered in the annals of New York. The State took an active part in\r\nthe war of independence, and was the theatre of many important military\r\nevents. The defeat of Washington at Long Island and at White Plains in\r\nthe autumn of 1776, the surrender of Burgoyne in October, 1777, and the\r\ntaking of Stony Point by Wayne in July, 1779, are the most important\r\nactions that took place here during the Revolutionary contest. The\r\nsanguinary naval battle of Lake Champlain in the war of 1812, in which\r\nMcDonough defeated the British after a hard-fought action, and several\r\nother minor engagements, took place within the limits of New York in the\r\nlast struggle with Great Britain. During the civil war New York took an\r\nactive and prominent part in aiding the government in the suppression of\r\nthe rebellion; her quotas of troops were promptly filled, $40,000,000\r\nbeing paid in bounties to her volunteers.\r\n\r\n=New York.= The chief commercial city of the United States, and the most\r\npopulous, is situated at the southern extremity of Manhattan Island, at\r\nthe junction of the Hudson River and the extension of Long Island Sound,\r\nknown as the East River, about 18 miles from the Atlantic. It was\r\nfounded in 1613 by Dutch traders, who built two trading forts and four\r\nhouses on Manhattan Island, and called the settlement New Amsterdam. It\r\nwas taken by the English in 1664, and its name changed to New York in\r\nhonor of the Duke of York, brother of Charles II. Nine years later it\r\nwas recaptured by the Dutch, and its name changed to New Orange in honor\r\nof the prince of that title; but in February, 1674, the English obtained\r\npossession of it by treaty, and restored the name which they had\r\nformerly given it. During the Revolutionary war New York was occupied by\r\nthe English troops after the battle of Long Island, and was evacuated by\r\nthem November 25, 1783. In the civil war the city was among the first in\r\nmanifesting its loyal disposition, and furnished over 116,000 men in\r\nsupport of the Union cause.\r\n\r\n=New Zealand.= A group of islands lying in the South Pacific Ocean,\r\ndiscovered by Tasman in 1642. The right of Great Britain to New Zealand\r\nwas recognized in 1814. An insurrection of the natives (Maoris) took\r\nplace in March, 1860; several indecisive actions took place between the\r\nnatives and the militia, March 14-28, 1860; war broke out at Taranaki,\r\nand the British were repulsed with loss on June 30; Gen. Pratt defeated\r\nthe Maoris at Mahoetahi, and destroyed their fortified places November\r\n6. The Maoris were defeated December 29, 1860, January 23, February 24,\r\nMarch 16-18, 1861; the natives surrendered March 19, 1861. The Maoris\r\nagain resorted to war in May, 1863; Gen. Cameron defeated them at\r\nRangariri November 20; and forced the Maori king to capitulate December\r\n9, 1863. The British were repulsed at Galepa (the gate pah) with loss of\r\nofficers and men, April 29, 1864. The Maoris were again severely\r\ndefeated January 25 and February 25, 1864. The Maoris continued in a\r\nstate of insurrection, but were finally overcome in 1865.\r\n\r\n=Nez Percés Indians= (“pierced noses”). A tribe of aborigines of the\r\nSahaptin family, who were located on a reservation in Northern Idaho. In\r\n1877 they broke into open hostilities against the whites, and after a\r\nsanguinary struggle under their chief Joseph they were at length\r\ncaptured by Gen. Miles and transported to Indian Territory. Some few\r\nescaped to the British possessions, where they still remain.\r\n\r\n=Niagara.= Chief town of Lincoln County, in the Canadian province of\r\nOntario, on Lake Ontario. It was burnt down in December, 1813, by the\r\nAmerican general McClure on his retreat; it was afterwards rebuilt.\r\n\r\n=Niagara, Battle of.= See LUNDY’S LANE.\r\n\r\n=Nicæa= (anc. _Nicæensis_, _Nicensis_). Formerly one of the most\r\ncelebrated cities of Asia, stood on the eastern side of Lake Ascania\r\n(now _Iznik_), in Bithynia. At the battle of Nice, 194, the emperor\r\nSeverus defeated his rival, Niger, who was again defeated at Issus, and\r\nsoon after taken prisoner and put to death. Under the later emperors of\r\nthe East, Nicæa long served as a bulwark of Constantinople against the\r\nArabs and Turks; it was taken by the Seljuks in 1078, and became the\r\ncapital of the sultan Soliman; it was retaken by the first Crusaders in\r\n1097. After the taking of Constantinople by the Venetians and the\r\nFranks, and the foundation of the Latin empire there in 1204, the Greek\r\nemperor, Theodorus Lascaris, made Nicæa the capital of a separate\r\nkingdom, in which his followers maintained themselves with various\r\nsuccess against the Latins of Constantinople on the one side, and the\r\nSeljuks of Iconium on the other, and in 1261 regained Constantinople. At\r\nlength, in 1330, Nicæa was finally taken by Orchan, the son of the\r\nfounder of the Ottoman empire, Othman.\r\n\r\n=Nicæa.= A fortress of the Epicnemidian Locrians on the sea, near the\r\npass of Thermopylæ, which it commanded. From its important position it\r\nis often mentioned in the wars of Greece with Macedonia and with the\r\nRomans. In the former its betrayal to Philip by the Thracian dynast\r\nPhalæcus led to the termination of the Sacred war, 346 B.C.; and after\r\nvarious changes it is found at the time of the wars with Rome in the\r\nhands of the Ætolians.\r\n\r\n=Nicaragua, Republic of.= Formerly a State in the Central American\r\nConfederation, from which it withdrew in 1852. The inhabitants of the\r\ncountry are Indians and _mestizoes_, with a scattering of a few whites\r\nand negroes. It has been the scene of many revolutions for the last\r\nthirty-five years.\r\n\r\n=Nice= (It. _Nizza_, anc. _Nicæa_). Chief town since 1860 of the\r\ndepartment of the Maritime Alps, France, on both sides of the river\r\nPaglione, 100 miles south-southwest from Turin. It was the seat of a\r\ncolony from Massilia, now Marseilles, and formed part of the Roman\r\nempire. It first became important as a stronghold of the Christian\r\nreligion, which was preached there by Nazarius at an early period. In\r\nthe Middle Ages it was subject to Genoa, and suffered from the frequent\r\nwars, being taken and retaken by the Imperialists and French. It was\r\ntaken by the Austrians under Melas, 1800; seized and annexed to France,\r\n1792; restored to Sardinia in 1814; again annexed to France in virtue of\r\nthe treaty of March 24, 1860. The French troops entered April 1, and\r\ndefinite possession was taken June 14 following. Garibaldi protested\r\nvehemently against this annexation. The town of Nice is remarkable as\r\nthe birthplace of Masséna, one of the most famous of Napoleon’s\r\ngenerals.\r\n\r\n=Nicomedia= (now ruins at _Izmid_, or _Iznikmid_). A celebrated city in\r\nAsia Minor, capital of Bithynia, built by King Nicomedes I., 264 B.C.,\r\nat the northeast corner of the Sinus Astacenus (now _Gulf of Izmid_).\r\nLike its neighbor and rival Nicæa, it occupied an important place in the\r\nwars against the Turks; it is memorable in history as the scene of\r\nHannibal’s death. It surrendered to the Seljukian Turks, 1078, and to\r\nOrchan and the Ottoman Turks in 1338.\r\n\r\n=Nicopolis=, or =Nikopoli=. A town of Turkey in Europe, in Bulgaria,\r\nsituated on the Danube. The Hungarians under Sigismund were defeated\r\nhere in 1396 by the Turks.\r\n\r\n=Nicosia=, or =Lefkosia=. The capital of Cyprus, stands near the centre\r\nof the island, on the right bank of the Pedia. In 1570 it was stormed by\r\nthe Turks, who on that occasion put to the sword about 20,000 of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n=Niemen=, or =Memel=. A large river of Lithuania, which rises a few\r\nmiles south of Minsk. Napoleon I. and Alexander of Russia held an\r\ninterview on the waters of this river in 1807.\r\n\r\n=Nieuport.= A fortified town of Belgium, in the province of West\r\nFlanders, 11 miles southwest from Ostend. This place has often been\r\nbesieged and taken and retaken by the French and English.\r\n\r\n=Nigher= (_Ind._). Any fortified city measuring at least 8 coss, or 8\r\nEnglish miles, in length and breadth.\r\n\r\n=Night-firing.= When a fixed object is to be fired at by night, the\r\npiece should be directed during the day, and two narrow and well-dressed\r\nstrips of wood (to prevent injury to the strips from the recoil, they\r\nshould be nailed at such a distance from the carriage that the space can\r\nbe filled up with a strip that can be removed before firing) laid on the\r\ninside of the wheels, and two others outside of the trail of a siege\r\ncarriage, and nailed or screwed to the platform. In case of a barbette\r\ncarriage, the traverse wheels should be chocked in the proper position.\r\nTo preserve the elevation, measure the height of the elevating-screw\r\nabove its box, or take the measure between a point on the gun and\r\nanother on the stock; cut a stick to this length and adjust the gun on\r\nit at each fire. _Direction_ of fire may be secured at night with\r\nmortars by nailing or screwing two boards to the platform outside of the\r\ncheeks, and the _elevation_ by drawing a line across one of the\r\ntrunnions, or by inserting a wedge-shaped block of the proper\r\ninclination below the mortar and the front transom or step. Night-firing\r\nwith guns should be limited to a small number of rounds, as it consumes\r\nammunition to little advantage.\r\n\r\n=Night-signaling.= An important branch of signaling. It may be effected\r\nin various ways. In ordinary service two torches are used,--one on the\r\nground and the other attached to a staff, which is used precisely as the\r\nflag for day signals. Lanterns held in the hands can also be used. For\r\nlong distances and when stations cannot be seen on account of\r\nintervening obstacles, such as woods, signal-rockets, candle-bombs, and\r\nother pyrotechnic devices are used.\r\n\r\n=Nihilists.= The name given to a political party in Russia. Beyond the\r\nextinction of imperialism it is difficult to give their creed.\r\n\r\n=Nijni-Novgorod=, or =Nijnei-Novgorod= (Lower Novgorod). A fortified\r\ntown and the capital of the government of the same name in Russia. It is\r\nan ancient town, and was founded in 1221 by Prince Yury Vsevolodovitch\r\nas a stronghold against the invasions of the Bulgarians and the Mordva.\r\nIt was devastated on several occasions by the Tartars; and in 1612,\r\nduring the civil dissensions in Russia, when it was on the point of\r\nfalling a prey to Poland, Minin, the famous butcher of Nijni-Novgorod,\r\ncollected an armed force here, which, under Prince Pojarsky, drove the\r\ninvaders from the capital.\r\n\r\n=Nikolsburg=, or =Mikulov=. A town of Austria, in the south of Moravia,\r\n27 miles south of Brunn. Here were signed, July 26, 1866, the\r\npreliminaries of a peace between Austria and Prussia.\r\n\r\n=Nile, The.= A river of Northeastern Africa, and one of the most\r\npowerful, most interesting, and most celebrated rivers on our globe.\r\nNear Rosetta, at the mouth of the Nile, a naval battle took place,\r\nAugust 1, 1798, between the Toulon and British fleets, the latter\r\ncommanded by Lord (then Sir Horatio) Nelson. Nine of the French\r\nline-of-battle ships were taken, two were burnt, and two escaped. The\r\nFrench ship L’Orient with Admiral Brueys and 1000 men on board, blew up,\r\nand only 70 or 80 escaped. This engagement is also called the battle of\r\nAboukir.\r\n\r\n=Nimeguen=, or =Nymwegen=. The _Noviomagum_ of the Romans, called by\r\nTacitus _Batavorum oppidum_, and in the Middle Ages _Numaga_, is the\r\nprincipal city of the district of the same name, or the Betuwe, in\r\nHolland, province of Guelderland. Nimeguen is celebrated for the great\r\npeace congress of the European powers which was held here, and, August\r\n10, 1678, concluded a treaty between Spain and France on September 17,\r\nbetween France and the United Netherlands, and between the German empire\r\nand France, and the same empire and Sweden, February 5, 1679. The French\r\nwere successful against the British under the Duke of York before\r\nNimeguen, October 28, 1794; but were defeated by them November 8.\r\n\r\n=Nimes=, or =Nismes= (anc. _Nemausus_). A city of France, and the chief\r\ntown of the department of the Gard, 30 miles northeast from Montpellier.\r\nPreviously to the Roman invasion, it (supposed to have been founded by a\r\ncolony from Massilia) was the chief city of the Volcæ Arecomici. It\r\nsurrendered to the rule of the Visigoths between 465 and 535, and\r\nafterwards to that of the Franks; subsequently, it became a possession\r\nof Aragon; but was finally restored to France in 1259 by the treaty of\r\nCorbeil. In 1791 and 1815, bloody religious and political reactions took\r\nplace here. The treaty termed the Pacification of Nimes (July 14, 1629)\r\ngave religious toleration for a time to the Huguenots.\r\n\r\n=Nimrûd=, or =Nimroud=. The Arab name of the great mound on the east\r\nbank of the Tigris, near Mosul, supposed to represent the Assyrian city\r\nof Calah, which was destroyed at the final conquest of Assyria by the\r\nMedes and Babylonians.\r\n\r\n=Nineveh.= The greatest city in Assyria and for some time the capital of\r\nthe country, was situated on the eastern bank of the Tigris at its\r\njunction with the stream of the Khosr. The walls of Nineveh are\r\ndescribed as about 55 miles in circumference, 100 feet high, and thick\r\nenough to allow three chariots to pass each other on them; with 1500\r\ntowers, 200 feet in height. The city is said to have been entirely\r\ndestroyed by fire, when it was taken by the Medes and Babylonians, about\r\n606 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Ninians, St.= A town and parish of Scotland, in Stirlingshire, about a\r\nmile south from Stirling. Several battles have been fought in this\r\nparish. The first was between the Scottish followers of Wallace and the\r\nEnglish, who were defeated, the second was the famous battle of\r\nBannockburn, and the third was that in which James III. of Scotland was\r\ndefeated and slain by his rebellious nobles.\r\n\r\n=Nipple.= Any small projection in which there is an orifice for\r\ndischarging a fluid, or for other purposes, as the nipple of a\r\npercussion-lock, or that part on which the cap is put to be fired.\r\n\r\n=Niquibs= (_Ind._). Men whose military functions among the Sepoys\r\ncorrespond with those of corporals in other services.\r\n\r\n=Nisbet=, or =Nesbit= (Northumberland, Eng.). Here a battle was fought\r\nbetween the English and Scotch armies, the latter greatly\r\ndisproportioned in strength to the former. Several thousands of the\r\nScots were slain upon the field and in the pursuit, May 7, 1402.\r\n\r\n=Nishapoor=, or =Nishapur=. A town of Persia, province of Khorassan. The\r\ntown is said to be very ancient, and to have existed in the time of\r\nAlexander the Great, by whom it was destroyed. In 1269 it was sacked by\r\nthe Tartars, again by Ihengiz-khan, and in 1749 by Nadir Shah, from\r\nwhich last calamity it has never recovered.\r\n\r\n=Nisibis.= The capital of ancient Mygdonia, the northeastern part of\r\nMesopotamia. It was a place of great importance as a military post, was\r\ntwice taken by the Romans (under Lucullus and Trajan), and again given\r\nup by them to the Armenians; but being a third time taken by Lucius\r\nVerus in 165, it remained the chief bulwark of the Roman empire against\r\nthe Persians, till it was surrendered to them by Jovian after the death\r\nof Julian in 363.\r\n\r\n=Nissa=, or =Nish=. A well-fortified town of Turkey in Europe, in the\r\nprovince of Servia, about 120 miles southeast from Belgrade. It commands\r\nthe communication between the provinces of Servia, Bulgaria, and\r\nRoumelia. It was taken by Amurath II. in 1389, and again by the\r\nAustrians in 1737.\r\n\r\n=Nithing.= A coward or poltroon.\r\n\r\n=Nitre.= Potassium nitrate or saltpetre, the most important ingredient\r\nof gunpowder. It is obtained principally from the East Indies. It has\r\nbeen the policy of the American government to keep large quantities in\r\nstore. See SALTPETRE.\r\n\r\n=Nitro-cellulose.= See GUN-COTTON.\r\n\r\n=Nitro-glycerine.= Is a light, yellow, oily liquid, inodorous, with a\r\nsweet, pungent, aromatic taste. It received its name from Sobrero, a\r\nchemist, who in 1847 discovered that glycerine when treated with nitric\r\nacid was converted into a highly-explosive substance. This liquid\r\nappears to have been almost forgotten by chemists until in 1864 Nobel, a\r\nSwedish engineer, succeeded in applying it to a very important branch of\r\nhis art, namely, blasting. It is now prepared by introducing glycerine\r\ninto a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, the whole being kept at a\r\ntemperature below freezing-point. When uncongealed this preparation\r\nexplodes by concussion, and is therefore unfit for transportation, and\r\nvery dangerous to handle while in that state. The chief advantage for\r\nmining purposes which nitro-glycerine possesses is, that it requires a\r\nmuch smaller hole or chamber than gunpowder does, the strength of the\r\nlatter being scarcely one-tenth of the former. Hence the miner’s work,\r\nwhich, according to the hardness of the rock, represents from five to\r\ntwenty times the price of the gunpowder used, is so short that the cost\r\nof blasting is often reduced 50 per cent. The process is very easy: if\r\nthe chamber of a mine presents fissures it must first be lined with\r\nclay, to make it water-tight; this done, the nitro-glycerine is poured\r\nin, and water after it, which, being the lighter liquid, remains at the\r\ntop. A slow-match, with a well-charged percussion-cap at one end, is\r\nthen introduced into the nitro-glycerine. The mine may then be sprung by\r\nlighting the match, there being no need of tamping. Submarine mines may\r\nbe sprung by electricity. In this manner the obstructions of Hell Gate,\r\nN. Y., were removed by Gen. Newton, one of the greatest engineering\r\nfeats of the time. On account of its liability to spontaneous explosion,\r\nthe great danger in handling it, and its liability to decomposition,\r\nnitro-glycerine is now almost entirely superseded for ordinary mining\r\npurposes by dynamite.\r\n\r\n=Nitroleum.= Nitro-glycerine; a name given it by Shaffner, an American\r\npatentee of high explosives.\r\n\r\n=Nitro-mannite.= See MANNITE, NITRO-.\r\n\r\n=Nive.= A river in the southwest of France, the scene of an important\r\nbattle, December, 1813. After Wellington had forced Marshal Sault to\r\nfall back on Bayonne from the Pyrenees, the former determined to cross\r\nthe Nive in order to place the right of his own army upon the Adour,\r\nwith the double purpose of establishing a communication with the\r\ninterior of France, and cutting off the enemy’s means of obtaining\r\nsupplies. The brunt of this enterprise fell upon the right division of\r\nWellington’s army under Lord Hill, a good deal of work, however, being\r\ndone by the left division under Sir John Hope. Hill’s success was\r\ncomplete, and after five days’ fighting (December 9-13), the passage of\r\nthe Nive had been effected, with the loss on the part of the British of\r\n650 killed and 3459 wounded.\r\n\r\n=Nivelle.= A small river which rises in Spain, and, after a short\r\ncourse, falls into the Bay of Biscay at St. Jean-de-Luz, in the French\r\ndepartment of the Lower Pyrenees, near which the Duke of Wellington\r\ncrossed the river in 1812, after carrying the French posts.\r\n\r\n=Nizam’s Dominions=, or =Hyderabad=. An extensive territory in the\r\ninterior of Southern India, lying to the northwest of the Presidency of\r\nMadras. In 1687 the territory now known as the Nizam’s Dominions, became\r\na province of the Mogul empire; but in 1719 the governor or viceroy of\r\nthe Deccan, Azoph Jah, made himself independent, and took the title of\r\n_Nizam-ool-Moolk_ (Regulator of the State). After his death, in 1748,\r\ntwo claimants appeared for the throne,--his son Nazir Jung, and his\r\ngrandson Mirzapha Jung. The cause of the former was espoused by the East\r\nIndia Company, and that of the latter by a party of French adventurers\r\nunder Gen. Dupleix. Then followed a period of strife and anarchy. In\r\n1761, Nizam Ali obtained the supreme power, and after some vacillation\r\nsigned a treaty of alliance with the English in 1768. He aided them in\r\nthe war with Tippoo Sahib, sultan of Mysore, and at the termination of\r\nthat war, in 1799, a new treaty was formed, by which, in return for\r\ncertain territorial concessions, the East India company bound itself to\r\nmaintain a subsidiary force of 8000 men for the defense of the Nizam’s\r\ndominions. The Nizam or ruler, _Afzul-ul-Dowlah_, remained faithful to\r\nthe British during the mutiny of 1857-58.\r\n\r\n=Nizza-Montferrato.= A town of northern Italy, province of Alessandria,\r\non the Belbo. It was a strongly-fortified place during the Middle Ages,\r\nwas besieged unsuccessfully for forty days by Charles of Anjou, and\r\nafterwards suffered severely from the Spanish and French armies.\r\n\r\n=Noblesse Militaire= (_Fr._). Military nobility. Although most of the\r\norders may be considered as appendages which confer a species of\r\nmilitary nobility, especially that of the British “Garter,” which was\r\ninstituted by King Edward III. on January 19, 1344, yet the British\r\ncannot be strictly said to have among them that species of military\r\nnobility or distinction that was peculiarly known in France under the\r\nimmediate title of _noblesse militaire_. In order to reward military\r\nmerit, an edict was issued by the French court at Fontainebleau, in\r\nNovember, 1750, and enregistered on the 25th of the same month by the\r\nParliament of Paris, whereby a _noblesse militaire_, or military\r\nnobility, was created; the acquisition of which depended wholly upon\r\nmartial character, but did not require any letters patent for the\r\npurpose of ennobling the individual. By the first article of this\r\nperpetual and irrevocable edict, as it was then stated, it was decreed\r\nthat no person serving in the capacity and quality of officer in any of\r\nthe king’s troops, should be liable to the land- or poll-tax, so long as\r\nhe continued in that situation. (2) That by virtue of this edict, and\r\nfrom the date thereof, all general officers, not being otherwise\r\nennobled, but being actually and bona fide in the service, should be\r\nconsidered as noble, and remain so, together with their children, born\r\nor to be born in lawful wedlock. (3) That in future the rank of general\r\nofficer should of itself be sufficient to confer the full right of\r\nnobility upon all those who should arrive at that degree of military\r\npromotion; and that their heirs and successors, as well as their\r\nchildren, actually born and lawfully begotten, should be entitled to the\r\nsame distinction; and that all general officers should enjoy all the\r\nrights and privileges of nobility from the date of their commissions. In\r\nArticles IV., V., VI., and VII., it was specifically provided upon what\r\nconditions those officers, who were not noble, and were inferior in rank\r\nto that of maréchal-de-camp, but who had been chevaliers or knights of\r\nthe royal and military order of St. Louis, and who should retire from\r\nthe service after having been in the army during thirty years without\r\nintermission, were to be exempted from the payment of the land- and\r\npoll-tax, and how the same privileges were to be transferred to their\r\nsons, provided they were in the service. By Article VIII. it was\r\nenacted, that those officers who had risen to the rank of captain, and\r\nwere chevaliers or knights of the order of St. Louis, but who were\r\ndisabled by wounds, or diseases contracted in the service, should not be\r\nobliged to fill up the period of thirty years as prescribed by the\r\nrecited articles. By Article IX. it was provided that when any officer,\r\nnot under the rank of captain, died in the actual exercise of the\r\nfunctions or bearing the commission of captain, the services he had\r\nalready rendered should be of use to his sons, lawfully begotten, who\r\nwere either in the service or were intended for it. It was specified in\r\nArticles X. and XI. that every officer born in wedlock, whose father and\r\ngrandfather had been exempted from the land- or poll-tax, should be\r\nnoble in his own right, provided he got created a chevalier or knight of\r\nSt. Louis, had served the prescribed period, or was entitled to the\r\nexemption mentioned in Article VIII.; that if he should die in the\r\nservice, he would be considered as having acquired the rank of nobility,\r\nand that the title so obtained should descend, as a matter of right, to\r\nthe children, lawfully begotten, of such officers as had acquired it. It\r\nfurther specified, that even those who should have been born previous to\r\ntheir fathers being ennobled, were entitled to the same privilege.\r\nArticle XII. pointed out the method by which proofs of military nobility\r\nwere to be exhibited in conformity to the then existing edict. Articles\r\nXIII. and XIV. provided for those officers, who were actually in the\r\nservice at the promulgation of the edict, in proportion as the\r\nprescribed periods were filled up. This provision related wholly to the\r\npersonal services of officers; as no proof was acknowledged relative to\r\nservices done by their fathers or grandfathers, who might have retired\r\nfrom the army, or have died prior to the publication of the edict. The\r\nXVth or last Article was a sort of register, in which were preserved the\r\ndifferent titles that enabled individuals to lay claim to military\r\nnobility. The whole of this edict may be seen, page 206, in the 3d\r\nvolume “Des Elemens Militaires.” The French emperor Bonaparte instituted\r\nan order of nobility called the “Legion of Honor,” the political\r\ninfluence of which appears to be greater than any order ever\r\nestablished, even than that of the Jesuits. He also adopted the ancient\r\nmilitary title of duke, which was conferred only on men who had merited\r\nrenown by their military greatness. The title of count was also\r\nestablished, and all the members of the Legion of Honor held a rank\r\ncorresponding with the knights of feudal institution. Private soldiers\r\nand tradesmen, for acts of public virtue, have been created members of\r\nthe Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\n=Noblesse Oblige.= A French phrase,--rank has its obligations.\r\n\r\n=Nocera dei Pagani= (anc. _Nuceria Alfaterna_). A town of Southern\r\nItaly, province and 8 miles northwest of Salerno. During the second\r\nSamnite war (315 B.C.) the Nucerians, who were on friendly terms with\r\nthe Romans, were induced to abandon their alliance and make common cause\r\nwith the Samnites, for which they were punished in 308 by the Roman\r\nconsul Fabius, who invaded their territory, laid siege to their city,\r\nand compelled them to unqualified submission. In the second Punic war\r\nthe city was besieged by Hannibal, and after a vigorous resistance was\r\ncompelled by famine to surrender; it was given up to plunder and totally\r\ndestroyed, while the surviving inhabitants took refuge in the other\r\ncities of Campania. It again became a flourishing town, and its\r\nterritory was ravaged in the Social war, 90 B.C. The decisive battle\r\nbetween Narses and Teïas, which put an end to the Gothic monarchy in\r\nItaly (533 A.D.), was fought in its neighborhood. Its modern appellation\r\nis derived from the circumstance that in the 13th century a body of\r\nSaracens were established there by the emperor Frederick II.\r\n\r\n=Nogent-le-Rotrou.= A parish and town of France, in the department of\r\nthe Eure and Loire, 33 miles southwest from Chartres. Taken by the\r\nEnglish in 1428.\r\n\r\n=Nola.= A city of Italy, province of Terra di Lavoro, 14 miles\r\neast-northeast of Naples. The ancient Nola was founded by the Ausonians,\r\nbut afterwards fell into the hands of the Tyrrheni (Etruscans). In 327\r\nB.C. it was sufficiently powerful to send 2000 soldiers to the\r\nassistance of Neapolis. In 313 the town was taken by the Romans. It\r\nremained faithful to the Romans even after the battle of Cannæ, when the\r\nother Campanian towns revolted to Hannibal; and in consequence retained\r\nits own constitution as an ally of the Romans. In the Social war it fell\r\ninto the hands of the confederates, and when taken by Sulla it was burnt\r\nto the ground by the Samnite garrison.\r\n\r\n=Nolan’s Range-finder.= See RANGE-FINDER.\r\n\r\n=Nolle Prosequi= (_Practice_). An entry made on the record of\r\ncourts-martial, by which the prosecutor or plaintiff declares that he\r\nwill proceed no further. The effect of a _nolle prosequi_, when\r\nobtained, is to put the defendant without day, but it does not operate\r\nas an acquittal; for he may be afterwards re-indicted, and even upon the\r\nsame indictment fresh process may be awarded.\r\n\r\n=Nomenclature.= Technical designation. For nomenclature of ordnance, see\r\nappropriate headings in this work.\r\n\r\n=Nominal.= By name, hence _nominal call_, which corresponds with the\r\nFrench _appel nominatif_; and, in a military sense, with our roll-call.\r\n\r\n=Non-combatant.= Any person connected with an army, or within the lines\r\nof an army, who does not make it his business to fight, as any one of\r\nthe medical officers and their assistants, chaplains, and others, also\r\nany of the citizens of a place occupied by an army; also, any one\r\nholding a similar position with respect to the navy.\r\n\r\n=Non-commissioned Officers= (Fr. _sous-officers_, Ger.\r\n_unter-offizieren_). Are the subordinate officers of the general staff,\r\nregiments, and companies who are appointed, not by commission, but by\r\nthe secretary of war or commanding officers of regiments; and they are\r\nusually selected on account of good conduct or superior abilities.\r\n\r\n=Non-effective.= Signifies men not fit or available for duty, in\r\ncontradistinction to effective (which see).\r\n\r\n=Noose.= A running knot, which binds the closer the more it is drawn.\r\n\r\n=Nootkas=, or =Ahts=. The generic name of the Indians residing on\r\nVancouver Island and the shore of the mainland along the sound of the\r\nsame name. They are subdivided into many tribes and number about 14,000,\r\nsome of whom are partially civilized.\r\n\r\n=Nora.= A mountain fortress of Cappadocia, on the borders of Lycaonia,\r\non the northern side of the Taurus, noted for the siege sustained in it\r\nby Eumenes against Antigonus for a whole winter.\r\n\r\n=Norba=, or =Norbanus= (now _Norma_). A strongly fortified town in\r\nLatium, on the slope of the Volscian Mountains, and near the sources of\r\nthe Nymphæus, originally belonged to the Latin and subsequently to the\r\nVolscian league. The Romans founded a colony at Norba in 492 B.C. It\r\nespoused the cause of Marius in the civil war, and was destroyed by fire\r\nby its own inhabitants when it was taken by one of Sulla’s generals.\r\n\r\n=Nordlingen.= A walled town of Bavaria, in the circle of Swabia, 48\r\nmiles southwest from Nuremberg. Here the Swedes under Count Horn were\r\ndefeated by the Austrians, August 27, 1634; and the Austrians and allies\r\nby Turenne in 1645.\r\n\r\n=Noreia= (now _Neumarkt_, in Styria, Austria). The ancient capital of\r\nthe Taurisci, or Norici, in Noricum. It was situated in the centre of\r\nNoricum, a little south of the river Murius, and on the road from\r\nVirunum to Ovilaba. It is celebrated as the place where Carbo was\r\ndefeated by the Cimbri, 113 B.C. It was besieged by the Boii in the time\r\nof Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n=Norfolk.= A city and capital of Norfolk Co., Va., on the Elizabeth\r\nRiver, an arm of Chesapeake Bay, about 18 miles from Fortress Monroe,\r\nhas a fine harbor, safe, commodious, and of sufficient depth to admit\r\nthe largest vessels. It is the largest naval station in the United\r\nStates. Its navy-yard was destroyed on April 21, 1861, by the Federals,\r\nto prevent the ships of war and naval stores that were there from being\r\nappropriated and used by the seceding States.\r\n\r\n=Noricum.= A Roman province south of the Danube, was bounded on the\r\nnorth by the Danube, on the west by Rhætia and Vindelicia, on the east\r\nby Pannonia, and on the south by Pannonia and Italy. Its inhabitants,\r\nthe most important of which were the Taurisci, also called Norici, were\r\nconquered by the Romans toward the end of the reign of Augustus, after\r\nthe subjugation of Rhætia by Tiberius and Drusus, and their country was\r\nformed into a Roman colony.\r\n\r\n=Normandy= (Fr. _Normandie_). Formerly a province in the north of\r\nFrance, bordering on the English Channel; now divided into the\r\ndepartments of Seine-Inférieure, Eure, Orne, Calvados, and Manche. In\r\nthe time of the Romans, the country bore the name of _Gallia Lugdunensis\r\nII._ Under the Frankish monarchs it formed a part of Neustria. From the\r\nbeginning of the 9th century it was continually devastated by the\r\nScandinavians, termed Northmen, or Normans, from whose irruptions\r\nCharles the Simple of France purchased immunity by ceding the duchy to\r\ntheir leader, Rollo, 905. Rollo, the first duke, and several of his\r\nsuccessors held it as a fief of the crown of France, until William, the\r\nseventh duke, acquired England in 1066; it was reunited to France in\r\n1204; was reconquered by Henry V. 1418, and held by England partially\r\ntill 1450.\r\n\r\n=Normans= (the Northmen). Toward the end of the 8th century Western\r\nEurope began to be scourged by the inroads of Scandinavian pirates,\r\nknown to the inhabitants of the British Isles as “East-men” and\r\n“Danes,”--to those of the continent as “North-men.” These Northmen were\r\nof Germanic stock, a vigorous, seafaring race, not yet Christianized,\r\npeopling the coasts of the Baltic and of the two peninsulas which form\r\nthe Norway and Sweden and the Denmark of to-day. Need and the national\r\nthirst for adventure and for strife drove forth from the thickening\r\npopulation, down upon the sunnier, richer, weaker South, swarms of\r\nvikings,--_i.e._ warriors,--who scourged the coasts of England, Germany,\r\nand France, pressed with their small, sharp, open vessels up the\r\nnarrowest streams, burned, slew, and plundered, and sailed away laden\r\nwith booty and with slaves. About the middle of the 9th century these\r\nraids began to assume an altogether new character and importance. The\r\nconsolidation of the three great Scandinavian kingdoms broke the power\r\nof the petty kinglets and independent nobles, and drove many a jarl\r\nforth with his followers to seek a freer life in some new home. Northmen\r\nthrew themselves in larger bands upon England, which the Wessex kings\r\nhad not yet fairly centralized; upon the Frankish kingdoms, fast falling\r\nasunder under the later Karlings; harried the country, besieged and\r\nsacked the cities, wintered at the mouths of the rivers, and by the end\r\nof the century had wrested from Alfred half his kingdom, and begun to\r\nplant colonies on the coasts of France. Northmen ravaged Spain and the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean, fell upon Western Italy, penetrated Greece\r\nand Asia Minor, and there met others of their countrymen, who had\r\npressed down through Russia. For in the Russia of that day, under the\r\nname of Verangians, Northmen had become the ruling class, a military\r\naristocracy; while those who made their way still farther south had\r\nformed the famous Verangian body-guard of the Byzantine emperors, which\r\nmaintained its existence and its distinctive character for five\r\ncenturies. During the latter half of the 9th century, also,\r\nScandinavians, sailing westward, found and settled Iceland. With the\r\nestablishment, early in the 10th century, of settlements upon the\r\ncontinent, with the occupation Scandinavian energy now found at home in\r\nwars between the three new kingdoms, and with the gradual triumph of\r\nChristianity in the North, Europe gained, at last, comparative rest.\r\nEngland’s period of misery and humiliation under Ethelred the Unready\r\n(979-1016), ended by the establishment of a Danish dynasty (1017-42),\r\nmarks the last great outburst of the pent-up heathenism.\r\n\r\n=Northallerton.= A town of Yorkshire, England, 31 miles northwest from\r\nYork. Near here was fought the “battle of the Standard,” where the\r\nEnglish under the Earls of Albemarle and Ferrers totally defeated the\r\nScotch armies, August 22, 1138. The archbishop of York brought forth a\r\nconsecrated standard on a carriage at the moment when they were hotly\r\npressed by the invaders, headed by King David.\r\n\r\n=Northampton.= The chief town of Northamptonshire, situated on the Nen,\r\nor Nene, 60 miles northwest from London. It was held by the Danes at the\r\nbeginning of the 10th century, and was burnt by them in 1010. Its castle\r\nwas besieged by the barons in 1215, during the civil wars of King John.\r\nOn July 10, 1460, a conflict took place between the Duke of York and\r\nHenry VI. of England, in which the king was defeated, and made prisoner\r\n(the second time) after a sanguinary fight which took place in the\r\nmeadows below the town. It was seized and fortified by the Parliamentary\r\nforces in 1642. On March 30, 1645, Cromwell marched from it with 1500\r\nhorse and two regiments of foot to Rugby. After the restoration, October\r\n17, 1661, the walls of Northampton were demolished, it having taken the\r\nside of the Parliament.\r\n\r\n=North Carolina.= One of the Southern Atlantic States, and one of the\r\noriginal thirteen of the American Confederacy. Attempts were made under\r\nthe auspices of Sir Walter Raleigh to settle North Carolina as early as\r\nbetween 1585 and 1589, but in one year after no trace of the colony\r\ncould be found. The first permanent settlement was made on the banks of\r\nthe Roanoke and Chowan, by some emigrants from Virginia, in 1653. John\r\nCulpepper rebelled against the arbitrary government of Miller in 1678,\r\nand held the government for two years. In 1693, North and South Carolina\r\nwere separated. In 1711 the Tuscaroras, Corees, and other savages\r\nattacked and massacred 112 settlers, principally of the Roanoke and\r\nChowan settlements; but the following year the united forces of the two\r\nCarolinas completely routed them, killing 300 savages. In 1729 the\r\nproprietors sold their rights to the crown. A party of malcontents, in\r\n1771, rose against the royal governor, but after two hours’ contest,\r\nfled with considerable loss. A severe conflict with the Northwest\r\nIndians occurred in 1774, on the Kanawha River, which resulted in the\r\nabandonment of the ground by the savages. North Carolina took an early\r\nand active part in the events of the Revolution, and within her borders\r\ntook place sanguinary conflicts at Guilford Court-house, Brier Creek\r\nSprings, Fishing Creek, and other places. The Mecklenburg Declaration of\r\nIndependence was made May 20, 1775: so North Carolina has the honor to\r\nhave first proposed a separation from Great Britain. In the second war\r\nwith Great Britain she also played a prominent part, although she had no\r\nserious losses on her territory. During the late civil war North\r\nCarolina suffered greatly, and was the scene of many important\r\nengagements, among which were the capture of Forts Hatteras and Clark in\r\n1861, Roanoke Island and Newbern in February, 1862, and Fort Fisher in\r\nJanuary, 1865. In March, 1865, the battles of Averysboro’ and\r\nBentonville were fought by the armies of Gen. Sherman and J. E.\r\nJohnston, which ended in the final surrender of the latter, at Durham\r\nStation, April 26, 1865.\r\n\r\n=Norwich.= A city of England, and the capital of the county of Norfolk,\r\non the river Wensum, 108 miles from London. In 1549 the city was the\r\nscene of an insurrection resembling that of the Jacquerie in France and\r\nthe Peasant’s war in Germany. The poor objected to the inclosure of\r\ncertain commons and waste lands in the neighborhood of Attleborough and\r\nWymondham; fences were thrown down; Robert, _alias_ Knight, a tanner, a\r\nbold and resolute man, headed the rebels, aided by his brother William,\r\na butcher. Their numbers increased, and, marching towards Norwich, they\r\nencamped on Mousehold Heath, took possession of the mansion of the Earl\r\nof Surrey, and thence proceeded to lay siege to the city. Having\r\naugmented their number to 16,000, and strongly fortified their camp,\r\nthey summoned the city to surrender. For months they maintained\r\nhostilities, and the country round was pillaged and laid waste, until at\r\nlength they gained an entrance to the city. A strong force was sent down\r\nfor the defense of the city, under the Marquis of Northampton, who was\r\ndefeated on St. Martin’s Palace plain; the rebels plundered and set fire\r\nto the city in many parts. The Earl of Warwick, assisted by his son\r\nRobert Dudley, earl of Leicester, was then sent to the relief of the\r\ncitizens. The city was stormed by the king’s troops, and the rebels\r\nforced to retreat after a two days’ sharp conflict, during which upwards\r\nof 3000 were killed, and the insurgents subdued. About 300 of the\r\nringleaders, including the two Ketts, were executed.\r\n\r\n=Nose-bag.= A bag of stout canvas with a leather bottom, and straps by\r\nwhich it can be hung over a horse’s head. It is used for feeding grain\r\nto horses out of stables.\r\n\r\n=Note.= A brief writing intended to assist the memory. Members of\r\ncourts-martial sometimes take notes. They are frequently necessary to\r\nenable a member to bring the whole body of evidence into a connected\r\nview, where the case is complex.\r\n\r\n=Noted.= Well known by reputation or report; celebrated; as, a noted\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\n=Nottingham.= A large town of England, the capital of the county of the\r\nsame name, 13 miles northeast from Derby. The castle here was defended\r\nby the Danes against King Alfred, and his brother Ethelred, who retook\r\nit, 868. William the Conqueror erected a castle, and constructed\r\nfortifications so strong as to render the place impregnable against any\r\nof the methods of attack which were then known. The castle of\r\nNottingham, defended by the royalists, was besieged by the Parliamentary\r\nforces under the command of Col. Hutchinson, to whom, after a brave\r\ndefense, it at length surrendered.\r\n\r\n=Nottoways.= A tribe of Indians who formerly resided in Virginia on the\r\nriver of the same name. As a distinct race they have ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n=Novara.= A city of Northern Italy, defended by a castle, 53 miles west\r\nfrom Turin. In 1849 the Sardinians were disastrously defeated here by\r\nthe Austrians; and in 1859 a French corps occupied the town.\r\n\r\n=Nova Scotia.= A province of British North America, connected with New\r\nBrunswick by a narrow isthmus lying between Chignecto and Varte Bays.\r\nThis country was discovered by Cabot in 1497; it was subsequently\r\nsettled by the French; and came into the possession of the English in\r\n1758.\r\n\r\n=Novi.= A town of Northern Italy, situated at the foot of the Apennines,\r\n13 miles southeast from Alessandria. It is noted for a sanguinary battle\r\nfought here in August, 1799, between the French under Joubert and the\r\nallied Austro-Russian forces under Suwarrow. The former were defeated,\r\nand among 10,000 of the French slain were Joubert and several other\r\ndistinguished officers.\r\n\r\n=Noyan= (_Fr._). In English _mandril_; it also means the whole of the\r\nvacant space or bore of a cannon, under which are comprehended the\r\ndiameter of the mouth, the vacant cylinder, the breech, and the vent.\r\nWith respect to bombs, grenades, and hollow balls, that which is called\r\n_noyan_ consists of a globular piece of earth, upon which the cover of\r\nbombs, grenades, and hollow balls is cast. The metal is poured in\r\nbetween this cover and the noyan, after which the noyan, or core, is\r\nbroken, and the earth taken out.\r\n\r\n=Nubia.= A large country of Africa, the ancient _Æthiopia supra\r\nÆgyptum_, said to have been the site of the kingdom of Meroë, received\r\nits name from a tribe named Nubes or Nubates. It is now subject to the\r\nviceroy of Egypt, having been conquered by Ibrahim Pasha in 1822.\r\n\r\n=Nuddea.= A town of British India, in the district of Burdwan, 80 miles\r\nnorth of Calcutta. It was taken and entirely destroyed in 1204.\r\n\r\n=Nuggar.= A term in the East Indies for a fort.\r\n\r\n=Nuits.= A small fortified town near Dijon, in Burgundy, Northeast\r\nFrance. It was frequently captured and ravaged, especially in 1569,\r\n1576, and 1636. It was taken by the Badenese under Von Werder, December\r\n18, 1870, after five hours’ conflict, in which above 1000 French are\r\nsaid to have been killed and wounded, and 700 prisoners taken. The\r\nGerman loss was also heavy. A depot of arms and ammunition was gained by\r\nthe victors.\r\n\r\n=Numantia.= The chief town of the Celtiberian people, called Arevaci, in\r\nancient Spain, was situated on the Douro, in Old Castile, and is\r\ncelebrated for the long war of twenty years which it maintained against\r\nthe Romans. See NUMANTINE WAR.\r\n\r\n=Numantine War.= The war between the Romans and the Celtiberians (Celts\r\nwho possessed the country near the Iber, now _Ebro_) began 143 B.C., on\r\naccount of the latter having given refuge to their allies, the\r\nSigidians, who had been defeated by the Romans. Numantia, an unprotected\r\ncity, withstood a long siege, in which the army of Scipio Africanus,\r\n60,000 men, was opposed by no more than 4000 men able to bear arms. The\r\nNumantines fed upon horse-flesh, and on their own dead, and at last drew\r\nlots to kill one another. At length, those whom plague and famine had\r\nspared destroyed themselves, so that no one remained to adorn the\r\ntriumph of the conqueror, 133 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Numéros= (_Fr._). Round pieces of brass or other metal, which were\r\nnumbered and used in the old French service in the detail of guards.\r\n\r\n=Numidia.= An ancient country of North Africa, the seat of the war of\r\nthe Romans with Jugurtha, which began 111 B.C., and ended with his\r\nsubjugation and captivity, 106. The last king, Juba, joined Cato, and\r\nwas killed at the battle of Thapsus, 46 B.C., when Numidia became a\r\nRoman province.\r\n\r\n=Nuncio.= An ambassador from the pope.\r\n\r\n=Nuremberg= (Ger. _Nürnberg_). A town of Bavaria, in the circle of\r\nMiddle Franconia, stands on the Pegnitz, an affluent of the Regnitz. In\r\n1219 it became a free city, independent of any European power, and as\r\nsuch it continued till it was given over by Napoleon in 1806 to the king\r\nof Bavaria. At the Reformation the inhabitants embraced the Protestant\r\ncause; and in the Thirty Years’ War they were on the side of the Swedes,\r\nand suffered much in 1632, during the blockade which Gustavus Adolphus\r\nendured from the imperial forces under Wallenstein. The city was\r\noccupied by the Prussians in 1866, and its fortifications demolished.\r\n\r\n=Nurse.= A person whose whole business is to attend the sick in\r\nhospital. In the U. S. service, nurses are detailed in post hospitals\r\nfrom the companies who are serving at the post, and are exempt from\r\nother duty, but have to attend the parades for weekly inspections and\r\nthe musters of their companies, unless especially excused by the\r\ncommanding officer. Ordinarily one nurse is allowed to every ten persons\r\nsick in hospital. In the British service there are sergeants, orderly\r\nmen, and nurses (generally women) in hospitals of regiments of the\r\nline.\r\n\r\n=Nuthall’s Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Nyköping.= A seaport of Sweden, pleasantly situated on the Baltic,\r\nabout 60 miles southwest of Stockholm. In 1317 the castle of Nyköping\r\nwas seized and sacked by the people, who demolished its keep and\r\ndonjons. In 1719 the town was taken and dismantled by the Russians.\r\n\r\n=Nystadt.= A town of Finland, on the eastern coast of the Gulf of\r\nBothnia, 50 miles south of Biorneborg. Here, in 1721, a treaty was\r\nagreed to between Russia and Sweden, by virtue of which all the\r\nconquests of Peter the Great along the coasts of the Gulf of Finland\r\nwere annexed to Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oakum.= A tangled mass of tarred hempen fibres, is made from old rope\r\nby untwisting the strands and rubbing the fibres free from each other.\r\nIts principal use is in calking the seams between planks, the space\r\nround rivets, bolts, etc., for the purpose of preventing water from\r\npenetrating.\r\n\r\n=Oaths, Military.= The taking of the oath of fidelity to government and\r\nobedience to superior officers, was, among ancient armies, a very solemn\r\naffair. A whole corps took the oath together, and sometimes an entire\r\narmy. The tribunes of every legion chose out one whom they thought the\r\nfittest person, and gave him a solemn oath at large, the substance of\r\nwhich was, that he should oblige himself to obey the commanders in all\r\nthings to the utmost of his power, be ready to attend whenever they\r\nordered his appearance, and never to leave the army but by their\r\nconsent. After he had ended, the whole legion, passing one by one, every\r\nman, in short, swore to the same effect, crying, as he went by, _Idem in\r\nme_, “the same by me.” In modern times when so many other checks are\r\nused in maintaining discipline, the oath has become little more than a\r\nform. A recruit enlisting in the army or navy, or a volunteer enrolling\r\nhimself, swears to be faithful to the government, and obedient to all or\r\nany of his superior officers. The members of a court-martial take an\r\noath to try the cases brought before them justly, according to the\r\nevidence, to keep secret the finding and sentence of the court, until\r\nthey shall be published by the proper authority, and to keep secret the\r\nvotes or opinions given by the members individually. The judge-advocate\r\nswears that he will not reveal the individual opinions or votes of the\r\nmembers nor the sentence of the court to any but the proper authority.\r\nThere is also an oath for the members and an oath for the recorder of a\r\ncourt of inquiry. The only other military oath is the common oath of a\r\nwitness before a court-martial, to tell the truth, the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR.\r\n\r\n=Obedience= (Fr. _obéissance_). Submission to the orders of a superior.\r\nThe first principle which ought to be inculcated and impressed upon the\r\nmind of every officer and soldier is obedience to all lawful commands.\r\nIt is the mainspring, the soul and essence of military duty. It is\r\nevident that if all officers and soldiers are to judge when an order is\r\nlawful and when not, the captious and mutinous would never be at loss\r\nfor a plea to justify their insubordination. It is, therefore, an\r\nestablished principle, that unless an order is so manifestly against law\r\nthat the question does not admit of dispute, the order must first be\r\nobeyed by the inferior, and he must subsequently seek such redress\r\nagainst his superior as the laws allow. If the inferior disputes the\r\nlegality before obedience, error of judgment is never admitted in\r\nmitigation of the offense. The redress now afforded by the laws to\r\ninferiors is not, however, sufficient; for doubtful questions of the\r\nconstruction of statutes, instead of being referred to the Federal\r\ncourts of law for their true exposition, have received variable\r\nexpositions from the executive, and left the army in an unfortunate\r\nstate of uncertainty as to the true meaning of certain laws; and this\r\nuncertainty has been most unfavorable to discipline. Again, while the\r\npunishment of death is meted to officers and soldiers for disobedience\r\nof _lawful_ commands, the law does not _protect_ officers and soldiers\r\nfor obeying _unlawful_ commands. Instances have occurred in the United\r\nStates, where officers and soldiers have been subjected to vexatious\r\nprosecutions, simply for obeying orders according to their oath of\r\noffice. Would it not be just if the law, instead of requiring officers\r\nand soldiers thus nicely to steer between Scylla and Charybdis, should\r\nhold the superior who gives an illegal order alone responsible for its\r\nexecution?\r\n\r\n=Obedience to Orders.= An unequivocal performance of the several duties\r\nwhich are directed to be discharged by military men. All officers and\r\nsoldiers are to pay obedience to the lawful orders of their superior\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n=Obey, To.= In a military sense, is without question or hesitation to\r\nconform zealously to all orders and instructions which are legally\r\nissued. It sometimes happens that individuals are called upon (by\r\nmistake, or from the exigency of the service) out of what is called the\r\nregular roster. In either case they must cheerfully obey, and after they\r\nhave performed their duty they may remonstrate.\r\n\r\n=Obidos.= A town of Portugal, in the province of Estremadura, situated\r\non the Amaya, 45 miles northwest from Lisbon. An engagement took place\r\nhere between the French and English in 1808.\r\n\r\n=Object.= A word in military movements and evolutions, synonymous with\r\n_point_. Thus, in marching forward in line, etc., the guide of a squad,\r\ncompany, or battalion, must take two objects at least to fix his line of\r\nmarch by which the whole body is regulated. As he advances he selects\r\nsuccession objects or points to prolong the line.\r\n\r\n=Object.= The mark aimed at in the fire of small-arms or artillery.\r\n\r\n=Objective-points.= The point to be reached or gained by an army in\r\nexecuting a movement, has been termed the “objective-point.” There are\r\ntwo classes of objectives, viz., _natural_ and _accidental_. The term\r\n_geographical_ is frequently used to designate the first of these.\r\n\r\nA _natural objective_ may be an important position, strong naturally, or\r\nmade so by fortifications, the possession of which gives control over a\r\ntract of country, and furnishes good points of support or good lines of\r\ndefense for other military operations. Or, it may be a great business\r\ncentre, or a capital of a country, the possession of which has the\r\neffect of discouraging the enemy and making him willing to sue for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n_Accidental objectives_ are dependent upon the military operations which\r\nhave for their object the destruction or disintegration of the enemy’s\r\nforces. These objectives are sometimes called “_objective-points of\r\nmanœuvre_.” The position of the enemy determines their location. Thus,\r\nif the enemy’s forces are greatly scattered, or his front much extended,\r\nthe central point of his position would be a good objective-point, since\r\nthe possession of it would divide the enemy’s forces, and allow his\r\ndetachments to be attacked separately. Or, if the enemy has his forces\r\nwell supported, a good objective would be on that flank, the possession\r\nof which would allow his communications with his base to be threatened.\r\nIt is well to remark that the term “point” used in this connection is\r\nnot to be considered merely in its geometrical sense, but is used to\r\napply to the object which the army desires to attain, whether it be a\r\nposition, a place, a line, or even a section of country.--_Prof. J.

In 1788 they ceded their lands to the State and moved to\r\nOntario, Canada, where about 400 of them now reside.\r\n\r\n=Onset.= A rushing or setting upon; a violent attack; assault; a\r\nstorming; especially the assault of an army or body of troops upon an\r\nenemy or a fort.\r\n\r\n=Onsetting.= A rushing upon or assaulting.\r\n\r\n=Onslaught.= Attack; onset; aggression; assault. “By storm and onslaught\r\nto proceed.”\r\n\r\n=Onward.= Toward the point before or in front; forward; as, to move\r\nonward.\r\n\r\n=Oodeypoor=, or =Mewar=. A Rajpoot state in India. It became tributary\r\nto the British government by the treaty of 1818. A corps of Bheels was\r\nraised in 1841 at the joint expense of the British and Oodeypoor\r\ngovernments, in order to reduce to subjection the Bheel districts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n=Oojein=, or =Oojain=. A city of India, in the territory of Gwalior, 152\r\nmiles southwest from Goonah. It fell into the power of the Mohammedans\r\nin 1310. At this time it was the capital of Malwa; and along with this\r\ncountry it afterwards came under the power of the Patans, but was\r\nrecovered by Akbar in 1561. In the middle of the 18th century it was\r\nconquered by the Mahrattas.\r\n\r\n=Opatas=, or =Yakis=. An Indian people who reside in the state of\r\nSonora, Mexico. They number about 25,000, and are generally peaceable\r\nand industrious.\r\n\r\n=Open.= In military movements and dispositions, this term is frequently\r\nused in contradistinction to _close_; as, open column, open distance,\r\nopen order, etc. It also constitutes part of a word of command; as, rear\r\nrank take open order. By _open distance in column_ is meant that the\r\nintervals are always equal in depth to the extent in front of the\r\ndifferent component parts of the column.\r\n\r\n=Open Flank.= In fortification, is that part of the flank which is\r\ncovered by the orillon.\r\n\r\n=Opening of Trenches.= Is the first breaking of ground by the besiegers,\r\nin order to carry on their approaches towards the place.\r\n\r\n=Operations, Lines of.= See LINES OF OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n=Operations, Military.= Consist in the resolute application of\r\npreconcerted measures in secrecy, dispatch, regular movements,\r\noccasional encampments, and desultory combats or pitched battles.\r\n\r\n=Opinion.= In military proceedings that regard the interior government\r\nof an army, this word signifies decision, determination, judgment formed\r\nupon matters that have been laid before a court-martial or court of\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n=Opinion.= Officers on courts-martial give their opinion by seniority,\r\nbeginning with the youngest in rank.\r\n\r\n=Oporto.= A city of Portugal, in the province of Entre-Douro-e-Minho,\r\nabout 2 miles from the mouth of the Douro, and 175 miles north from\r\nLisbon. It was attacked by the Moors under Abderrahman in 820. In 1092\r\ncertain knights of Gascony, commanded by Don Alfonso Fredrico, captured\r\nit from the Moors. It was famous for the strength of its fortifications\r\nduring the Middle Ages, its walls being 3000 paces in circumference, 30\r\nfeet in height, and flanked with towers. From the 17th to the present\r\ncentury, Oporto has been the scene of an unusual number of popular\r\ninsurrections. In 1808 it was taken by the French. The French, under\r\nMarshal Soult, were surprised here by Lord Wellington, and defeated in\r\nan action fought May 11, 1809. It was besieged in 1832 and 1833 by Dom\r\nMiguel, and successfully defended by Dom Pedro with 7500 men. In this\r\nsiege, the city suffered severely, and more than 16,000 of the\r\ninhabitants were killed. It has since been the scene of civil war. The\r\ninsurgents entered Oporto January 7, 1847; a Spanish force entered\r\nOporto, and the Junto capitulated, June 26, 1847.\r\n\r\n=Oppenheim.= A town of the grand duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, on the left\r\nbank of the Rhine, 10 miles southeast of Mayence. It occupies the site\r\nof the Roman castle of _Bauconia_, and was made a royal palatinate under\r\nthe Carlovingians. It afterwards became one of the most important free\r\ntowns of the empire. It was taken in 1218 by Adalbert, archbishop of\r\nMayence, in 1620 by the Spaniards, in 1631 by the Swedes under Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, and in 1634 by the Imperialists, suffering much upon all these\r\noccasions. In 1689 the French under Melac almost entirely destroyed it.\r\n\r\n=Opponent.= One who oppones, or opposes; an adversary; an antagonist; a\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\n=Oppose.= To act as an adversary against another; to resist, etc. It\r\nlikewise signifies to place as an obstacle.\r\n\r\n=Oppugn.= To fight against, whether in attack, resistance, or simple\r\nopposition; to attack; to oppose; to resist.\r\n\r\n=Oppugnant.= Tending to awaken hostility; hostile; opposing.\r\n\r\n=Or.= In heraldry the metal gold, represented in heraldic engravings by\r\nan unlimited number of dots.\r\n\r\n=Oran.= A seaport town of Algeria, about 220 miles west-southwest of\r\nAlgiers; it is defended by strongly armed forts. The town of Oran was\r\nbuilt by the Moors. It was taken by the Spaniards in 1509, by the Turks\r\nin 1708, and again by the Spaniards in 1732. It was taken by the French\r\nin 1831, and has since remained in their hands.\r\n\r\n=Orb.= In tactics, is the disposing of a number of soldiers in circular\r\nform of defense. The orb has been thought of consequence enough to\r\nemploy the attention of the famous Marshal de Puysegur, in his “Art of\r\nWar,” who prefers this position to throw a body of infantry in an open\r\ncountry to resist cavalry, or even a superior force of infantry; because\r\nit is regular, and equally strong, and gives an enemy no reason to\r\nexpect better success by attacking one place than another. Cæsar drew up\r\nhis whole army in this form when he fought against Labienus. The whole\r\narmy of the Gauls was formed into an orb, under the command of Sabinus\r\nand Cotta, when fighting against the Romans. The orb was generally\r\nformed six deep.\r\n\r\n=Orchomenus.= A city of Bœotia, and the capital of the powerful tribe of\r\nthe Minyæ, was situated near the western shore of Lake Copaic, on a hill\r\nwhich overlooked the windings of the Cephissus. Its original inhabitants\r\nare said to have been Thessalian emigrants, and its name was derived\r\nfrom Orchomenus, one of the kings of the Minyans. Homer compares its\r\ntreasures to those of Egyptian Thebes, and tells us that it sent 30\r\nships to the Trojan war. Some time after this event it became a member\r\nof the Bœotian confederacy. During the Persian war, like the other towns\r\nof Bœotia, it abandoned the national cause. Its government was\r\nthoroughly aristocratic, and after the Peloponnesian war, when Thebes\r\nbecame a democracy, Orchomenus took part with Sparta, and shared in its\r\nfirst triumph over Thebes; but the victory of Epaminondas at Leuctra\r\n(371 B.C.) placed it at the mercy of the Thebans, who soon after\r\ndestroyed it by fire, and sold its inhabitants as slaves. It was again\r\nrebuilt during the Phocian war, but was a second time destroyed in the\r\nreign of Philip of Macedon, who, however, once more rebuilt it; but it\r\nnever again became prominent in history. The site is now occupied by the\r\nmodern village of Skripú.\r\n\r\n=Orchomenus.= An ancient city of Arcadia, stood in a plain surrounded by\r\nhills, which separated its territory from that of Mantinea on the south\r\nand those of Pheneus and Stymphalus on the north. Its founder is said to\r\nhave been Orchumenus, the son of Lycaon, and several of its kings are\r\nsaid to have spread their rule over all Arcadia. During the\r\nPeloponnesian war, when its acropolis had fallen into ruins, and its\r\nlast king, Pisistratus, had been murdered by an oligarchical faction,\r\nOrchomenus began to decline. About 367 B.C. three of its tributary towns\r\nwere depopulated to furnish inhabitants to the newly-founded city of\r\nMegalopolis; in 313 B.C. it was taken by the Macedonian general\r\nCassander; and ever afterwards it continued to be bandied about between\r\ndifferent belligerent powers. At the time of Pausanias it was still\r\ninhabited, and at the present day its ruins are seen near the village of\r\nKalpáki.\r\n\r\n=Order.= This term, considered in its relation to the army, embraces\r\ndivers subjects. It gives an idea of harmony in the accomplishment of\r\nduties; a classification of corps or men; injunctions emanating from\r\nauthority; measures which regulate service, and many tactical details.\r\nIn tactics, the natural order is when troops coming upon ordinary ground\r\nare ranged in line of battle by the prescribed tactical means, and when\r\nthey are formed in column, right in front. The _oblique order_ is\r\ncontradistinguished from the parallel, and in general means every\r\ntactical combination, the aim of which is to produce an effect upon two\r\npoints of an enemy’s line by bringing a superior force to bear down on\r\nthese two points. Such combinations constitute the _oblique order_,\r\nwhatever manœuvres may be used to accomplish the object. The _parallel\r\norder_ operates, on the contrary, against the whole front of an enemy.\r\nTurenne and Condé fought habitually in parallel order, although they\r\nsometimes made a skillful use of oblique attacks. Guibert well says that\r\na contiguous and regular parallel order can be of no use in war.\r\n\r\n=Order Arms.= A word of command directing that the musket be brought\r\ndown to the right side of the soldier, the butt resting on the ground.\r\n\r\n=Order, Beating.= In the British service, is an authority given to an\r\nindividual empowering him to raise men by beat of drum for any\r\nparticular regiment, or for general service. It consists of a warrant\r\nwhich is signed by the secretary at war, or issued in his name by the\r\nadjutant-general.\r\n\r\n=Order Book.= Every company in the service has such a book, in which\r\norders are written for the information of officers and men. Order books\r\nare also kept at all military headquarters.\r\n\r\n=Order, Close.= In tactics, comprehends space of about one-half pace\r\nbetween ranks.\r\n\r\n=Order, Entire.= When applied to rank, means a straight line composed of\r\nhalf-files.\r\n\r\n=Order, Extended.= Is preparatory to rank entire, and is frequently\r\npracticed in light infantry manœuvres. It comprehends the opening of\r\nfiles of a battalion or company standing two deep, so as to have just\r\nspace enough for one man between each two. The battalion or company,\r\nafter it has obtained all its relative distances and been halted, is\r\nfronted, and each rear rank man springs into the vacancy when the word\r\nof command is given.\r\n\r\n=Order of Alcantara.= A Spanish military order. It was established by\r\nFerdinand II., king of Leon and Castile, in 1170. The knights wore a\r\ngreen cross upon their garments. See ALCANTARA.\r\n\r\n=Order of Amaranth.= An order of military knighthood, instituted in\r\nSweden by Queen Christina in 1645, at the close of an annual feast\r\ncelebrated in that country, and called _wirtschaft_. Their device was\r\nthe cipher of _amarante_, composed of two A’s, the one erect, the other\r\ninverted, and interwoven together; the whole inclosed by a laurel crown,\r\nwith the motto, _Dolce nella memoria_.\r\n\r\n=Order of Argonauts of St. Nicholas.= Was the name of a military order\r\ninstituted by Charles III., king of Naples, in 1382, for the advancement\r\nof navigation, or, as some authors say, merely for preserving amity\r\namong the nobles. They wore a collar of shells inclosed in a silver\r\ncrescent, from which hung a ship with the device, _Non credo tempori_.\r\n\r\n=Order of Battle.= The arrangement or disposition of the different\r\ncomponent parts of an army in one or more lines, according to the nature\r\nof the ground, for the purpose of engaging an enemy by giving or\r\nreceiving an attack, or in order to be reviewed, etc.\r\n\r\n=Order of Battle, Concave.= If the attack is made simultaneously on both\r\nwings, and the centre is refused, it is plain that the attacking army\r\nwill assume a line of battle which will be concave towards the enemy’s\r\nline.\r\n\r\n=Order of Battle, Convex.= If the attack is made in the centre of the\r\nenemy’s line, refusing both wings, the general direction of the line of\r\nbattle of the attacking army will be convex towards the enemy’s line,\r\nand the term “_convex order of battle_” is applied to it. Other orders\r\nof battle are named by military writers. Their names will generally\r\ndescribe the direction of the hostile lines of battle and the particular\r\nformation adopted by the attacking army.\r\n\r\n=Order of Battle, Oblique.= An arrangement of an army for battle with\r\none wing advanced beyond the other, or a movement which brings the line\r\nin contact with an enemy’s flank; in general, any combination which\r\nbrings a preponderating force upon any point of the enemy’s line. See\r\nORDER.\r\n\r\n=Order of Calatrava.= See CALATRAVA, ORDER OF.\r\n\r\n=Order of Knights of St. Stephen.= Instituted in 1561, by Cosmo, duke of\r\nFlorence. They wear a red cross with a border of gold.\r\n\r\n=Order of Knights of the Band.= Instituted by Alphonso, king of Spain,\r\nin 1268. Their name proceeded from the knights wearing a red scarf, or\r\nlace of silk, the breadth of 3 inches, which hung on their left\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n=Order of Knights of the Bath.= A military order in Great Britain,\r\nderiving its name from the ceremony of bathing, which was performed at\r\nthe initiation of the knights. The earliest authentic instance of this\r\nceremony was at the coronation of Henry IV. (1399). The last occasion on\r\nwhich this ceremony was used was the coronation of Charles II., in 1660,\r\nafter which the order fell into oblivion until it was revived by George\r\nI., in 1725. It is now the second in rank among the orders of England,\r\nthe order of the Garter being the highest. The order of the Bath\r\ncomprises three classes: first class, Knights Grand Cross (K.G.C.), the\r\nnumber of whom is limited to 50 military men and 25 civilians, besides\r\nthe royal family; second class, Knights Commanders (K.C.B.), = 102\r\nmilitary and 50 civil; these and the first have the title of Sir; third\r\nclass, Companions (C.B.), = 525 military and 200 civil.\r\n\r\n=Order of Knights of the Redemption.= Instituted in the kingdom of\r\nAragon by King James, who conquered the island of Majorca, in 1212.\r\nTheir garments are white, with a black cross thereon.\r\n\r\n=Order of Knights Templar.= See TEMPLAR, KNIGHTS.\r\n\r\n=Order of Maria Theresa.= This order was instituted in June, 1757, by\r\nthe empress queen of Hungary. In 1765 an intermediate class, styled\r\nknights commanders, was added to the two classes that originally\r\ncomposed the order.\r\n\r\n=Order of Merit.= Instituted by Frederick III., king of Prussia, as a\r\nreward to those officers whose behavior deserved some marks of\r\ndistinction. The ensign of this order is a golden star of eight rays,\r\nenameled with blue, which is worn appendant to a black ribbon edged with\r\nsilver. The motto is _Pour le merite_.\r\n\r\n=Order of Mount Carmel.= Instituted by Henry IV. in 1608.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. Alexander Newski.= Or the Red Ribbon, which was instituted\r\nby Peter I., emperor of Russia; but the czarina Catherine I. conferred\r\nit in 1725.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. Hubert.= See HUBERT, ST., ORDER OF.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. James.= See JAMES OF THE SWORD, ST.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. Lazarus.= See LAZARUS.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. Louis.= See LOUIS.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. Mark.= See MARK, ST., KNIGHTS OF.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. Michael.= Instituted in 1469 by Louis XII. in honor of the\r\nimportant services done to France by that archangel at the siege of\r\nOrleans, where he is supposed to have appeared at the head of the French\r\ntroops, disputing the passage of a bridge, and to have repulsed the\r\nattack of the English, whose affairs ever after declined in that\r\nkingdom. The order is a rich collar, with the image of that saint\r\npendent thereto; with the inscription, _Immensi tremor oceani_.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. Michael and St. George.= This order of knighthood, founded\r\nfor the Ionian Isles and Malta, April 27, 1818, was reorganized in\r\nMarch, 1869, in order to admit servants of the crown of England\r\nconnected with the colonies.\r\n\r\n=Order of St. Patrick.= See PATRICK, ST., ORDER OF.\r\n\r\n=Order of Teutonic Knights.= Established towards the close of the 12th\r\ncentury, and thus called, as chiefly consisting of Germans, anciently\r\ncalled Teutons.\r\n\r\n=Order of the Annunciation.= See ANNUNCIADA.\r\n\r\n=Order of the Bear.= See BEAR, ORDER OF.\r\n\r\n=Order of the Black Eagle.= See EAGLE, BLACK.\r\n\r\n=Order of the Crescent.= See CRESCENT.\r\n\r\n=Order of the Golden Fleece.= See GOLDEN FLEECE, ORDER OF THE.\r\n\r\n=Order of the Golden Stole.= A Venetian military order, so called from a\r\ngolden stole, which those knights wore over their shoulder, reaching to\r\nthe knee both before and behind, a palm and a half broad.

The orders of commanders of armies, divisions,\r\nbrigades, regiments, are denominated orders of such army, division,\r\netc., and are either general or special. They are numbered, general and\r\nspecial in separate series, each beginning with the year. In Great\r\nBritain and other European countries, and in the United States, orders\r\ngenerally take the designation of the headquarters from which they are\r\nissued.\r\n\r\n=Orders, General.= Are orders that are issued to announce the hours for\r\nroll-calls and duties; the number and kind of orderlies, and the time\r\nwhen they shall be relieved; police regulations, and the prohibitions\r\nrequired by circumstances and localities; returns to be made and their\r\nforms; laws and regulations for the army; promotions and appointments;\r\neulogies or censures to corps or individuals, and generally, whatever\r\nmay be important to make known to the whole command.\r\n\r\n=Orders, Military.= Companies of knights, instituted by kings and\r\nprinces either for defense of the faith, or to confer marks of honor on\r\ntheir military subjects.

The soldiers’ mess is so called among the French.\r\n\r\n=Ordinary of Arms.= In heraldry, an index or dictionary of armorial\r\ncoats, arranged, not according to names, like an armory, but according\r\nto the leading charges in the respective shields, so as to enable any\r\none conversant with heraldic language, on seeing a shield of arms, to\r\ntell to whom it belonged.\r\n\r\n=Ordinary Time.= In the U. S. army is quick time, which is 110 steps, or\r\n86 yards in one minute, or 2 miles 1613 yards in an hour.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance.= A general name for all kinds of weapons employed in war, and\r\nthe appliances necessary for their use. Under the general term ordnance\r\nand ordnance stores are included all guns, howitzers, mortars, rockets,\r\nand projectiles of every description, the explosives used in warfare,\r\nall gun-carriages, limbers, caissons, mortar-beds, battery-wagons, and\r\ntraveling-forges with their equipments, and all other apparatus and\r\nmachines required for the service and manœuvres of artillery at sieges\r\nor in the field; together with the materials for their construction,\r\npreservation, and repair. Also all small-arms, side-arms, and\r\naccoutrements for artillery, cavalry, and infantry, all ammunition for\r\ncannon and small-arms; and all stores of expenditures for the service of\r\nthe various arms, materials for the construction and repair of ordnance\r\nbuildings, utensils and stores for laboratories, including standing\r\nweights, gauges, and measures, and all other tools and utensils required\r\nfor the performance of ordnance duty. Harness and horse equipments are\r\nalso furnished by the ordnance department. This general application of\r\nthe word is not the purport of the present article; it is its special\r\nsignification as used by the artillery with which we have to do.\r\nTechnically speaking, ordnance is a term applied to all heavy fire-arms\r\nwhich are discharged from carriages.\r\n\r\n_History._--Although the battering-rams and the engines for projecting\r\nmissiles employed by the ancients and during the Middle Ages are\r\nregarded as artillery, yet the military weapons in use before the\r\ninvention of fire-arms cannot fairly come under this designation. At\r\nwhat exact date cannon were first used is not known, but guns called\r\n“Crakys of War” were employed by Edward III. against the Scots in 1327,\r\nby the French at the siege of Puy Guillaume in 1338, and by Edward III.\r\nat Crécy, and at Calais in 1346. The first cannon, or _bombards_, were\r\nclumsy, wider at the mouth than at the chamber, and made of iron bars\r\nhooped together with iron rings. Ancient cannon were also made of wood\r\nwound with rope or wire, and in some instances were even occasionally\r\nconstructed of leather. The balls fired from these bombards were first\r\nmade of stone, which was afterwards superseded by iron. In the 15th\r\ncentury various kinds were known by the names of cannon, bombards,\r\nculverins, serpentines, etc. Bombards of great length and power were\r\nemployed by Louis XI. during his Flemish campaign in 1477, some with\r\nstone balls and some with iron. About this time cannon began to be made\r\nof cast iron instead of hooped bars; and bronze or brass as material\r\nbegan to be used as well as iron, and projectiles were also made of cast\r\niron instead of stone. The introduction of cast-iron projectiles led to\r\nthe invention of _culverins_, which corresponded very nearly in\r\nconstruction and appearance to the guns of the present day; these were\r\nin some instances made of enormous lengths from the erroneous idea that\r\nthe range increased with the length of the piece. A remarkable gun of\r\nthis description still exists at Dover, England, familiarly known as\r\n“Queen Anne’s pocket-piece;” while it carries a ball weighing only 18\r\npounds, it is more than 28 feet in length. From the earliest days of\r\nartillery there existed short-chambered pieces, which projected stone\r\nballs under great angles of elevation; and in 1478 hollow projectiles\r\nfilled with powder began to be employed; but it is probable that the\r\naccidents which accompanied their use caused them to be abandoned for\r\nthe time. In 1634, however, this difficulty was overcome, and these\r\npieces were introduced into the French service, forming the class of\r\ncannon now known as mortars. Early attempts were also made to throw\r\nhollow projectiles from culverins and other long guns, but great\r\ndifficulties were experienced in loading them, and the accidents to\r\nwhich they were liable caused them to be abandoned. Subsequently,\r\nhowever, the Dutch artillerists reduced their length so that the\r\nprojectile could be inserted in its place by hand, and thus improved\r\nthese cannon rapidly came into use under the name of howitzers, from the\r\nGerman _Haubitz_. A short cannon of large caliber for naval service was\r\ninvented by Mr. Gascoigne in 1799, and called a _carronade_, after the\r\nCarron Iron-Works, Scotland, where it was first made. It was not for\r\nmany years after hollow projectiles had been used that it was\r\naccidentally discovered that the firing of the gun-charge could be\r\nrelied upon to light the fuze. Prior to this a long fuze lighted from\r\nthe outside had been used. The difficulties and danger incurred in\r\nloading long guns with hollow projectiles delayed their application to\r\nshell-firing, and it was not until 1812 that they were used for firing\r\nboth solid shot and shell at low angles. In this year a gun of this\r\nclass, which was invented by Col. Bomford, Chief of Ordnance, U.S.A.,\r\nwas adopted by the United States, and a number of these guns were used\r\nin the war with England, 1812-15. About 1814 this invention of Col.\r\nBomford’s was improved upon by himself, and the gun thus improved was\r\ncalled a _columbiad_. The columbiad gave way about 1859 to the gun\r\ninvented by Gen. Rodman. (See RODMAN GUN.) The dimensions of the\r\ncolumbiads were first taken to Europe by a young French officer, and\r\nthus fell into the hands of Gen. Paixhans, who introduced them, with\r\ncertain modifications, into the French service about 1822. They were by\r\nthis means first made known to the rest of Europe by the name of\r\n_Paixhan gun_, and small calibers were afterwards used in the U. S.\r\nservice under that name. Cannon up to this time were constructed on the\r\nsmooth-bore principle; the rifle principle, although employed by the\r\nRussians in 1615, by the Prussians in 1661, and by the Germans in 1696,\r\nhad not been brought into general use on account of its imperfectness.\r\nFrom 1696 to 1833 many attempts were made to rifle cannon with more or\r\nless success; but although the firing of smooth-bore guns was as\r\naberrant as that of smooth-bore muskets, and from greater range even\r\nmore so, yet, since the gunners were safe from musketry fire at 200\r\nyards, and the cannon could be directed against masses of men with\r\ntolerable certainty up to three times that distance, there was no\r\nspecial inducement to improve their powers. But the introduction of\r\nrifled small-arms changed the relative advantages; for a rifled\r\nsmall-arm might pick off the gunners of a smooth-bore cannon before\r\ntheir weapon could come into effective play. The Crimean war set\r\ninventors vigorously to work, and many admirable guns have resulted from\r\ntheir attempts, the great difficulty of the day being to decide which is\r\nmost effective. Rifled guns have nearly superseded smooth-bored cannon,\r\nexcept in the United States, which still gives the preference to the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance, Modern, History of.= Heavy modern ordnance dates properly\r\nfrom the casting of the great Rodman smooth-bores in the United States.\r\nTo the impetus thus given may be ascribed the origin of the powerful\r\nguns of the present day. In Rodman’s study of gunpowder and the\r\nimprovements introduced by him lay the germ of all subsequent progress\r\nin ordnance. His most important invention, _perforated cake powder_, was\r\ntransplanted bodily to the continent of Europe, where, under the name of\r\n_prismatic powder_, it has been used ever since. So perfect is the\r\ntheory of this powder that invention and science toiling over the\r\nsubject for twenty years has produced nothing better. Since the first\r\nhalf of the decade--1860-70--the United States has fallen behind the\r\nnations of Europe in the power of her armament. Having been committed by\r\nher two great inventors, Rodman and Dahlgren, to cast-iron smooth-bores,\r\nwhich were fabricated in great numbers, her attitude has been that of\r\nMicawber,--waiting for something to turn up. England occupies the other\r\nextreme,--of all the powers she has ventured the greatest sums upon the\r\ntheories of her gun-makers. Her private manufacturers have received such\r\nencouragement at home or abroad that they are now able to supply the\r\nwhole world. Their only great rival on the continent is Krupp, who finds\r\nhis market principally in Germany, Russia, and Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe early adoption of the rifle principle by all European powers placed\r\nthem at once on a plane of advancement. The vexed questions of breech-\r\nand muzzle-loading and of gun construction have been decided by each\r\nnation in the manner most satisfactory to itself. Opinions differ\r\nwidely, and it is probable that many changes may be made in these\r\nmatters. Still, they all possess powerful guns which have certain\r\nfeatures in common, essential to heavy ordnance in the present stage of\r\nits development. Large-grained powder, the first of these requisites,\r\nis universally used (for varieties, see GUNPOWDER). Great length of\r\nbore, to utilize the whole force of the powder, is another\r\ncharacteristic. Great power is secured by immense charges of powder and\r\nweight of shot. A caliber of at least 12 inches, giving an oblong shot\r\nof about 700 pounds, seems to be regarded as a _sine qua non_ for all\r\narmaments. (See CANNON, ORDNANCE, GREAT BRITAIN, RUSSIA, FRANCE, etc.)\r\nEngland has taken the lead in all these improvements, and though it\r\nwould appear from recent events that her choice of gun systems is\r\nunfortunate, there is no question that all great advances since Rodman’s\r\nday have been based upon her expensive experiments. The work of the\r\ncelebrated “Committee on Explosives,” 1875, of which Col. Younghusband\r\nand Capt. Noble (now a member of Sir Wm. Armstrong’s firm) were members,\r\ndid more to this end than any other investigation since Rodman’s\r\nexperiments in gunpowder. Acting upon the obvious idea that the peril to\r\nthe life of the gun is relieved by air-space, the committee recommended\r\nthe enlargement of the bore at the seat of the charge, or the use of a\r\nchamber larger than the bore. This simple expedient led at once to an\r\nimmense increase in the power of guns while the pressure endangering\r\nthem was kept at a point lower than before. Every good thing can be\r\npushed too far. The immense charges made possible by the English chamber\r\nhave been continually added to by the Italians in their 100-ton\r\nArmstrong monsters and the vital air-space reduced till a charge of 552\r\npounds of powder has recently (1880) burst one of these magnificent\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n_Nomenclature of Ordnance._--For component parts of cannon and their\r\ndescription, see CASCABEL, BASE OF THE BREECH, BASE-LINE, BASE-RING,\r\nBREECH, CHASE, ASTRAGAL AND FILLETS, NECK, SWELL OF THE MUZZLE, FACE,\r\nTRUNNIONS, RIMBASES, BORE, and REINFORCE. For recent modifications in\r\nthe external form of cannon, see ORDNANCE, STRAINS UPON.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES.--_Smooth-bored._--The official system for the land\r\nservice comprises the following smooth-bored cannon: The Napoleon gun\r\nfor field service (see NAPOLEON GUN) and the mountain howitzer for\r\nmountain and prairie service. (See HOWITZER.) For siege purposes, the\r\n8-inch howitzer, 8- and 10-inch and 24-pounder Coehorn mortars,--and for\r\nsea-coast defense, 13-, 15-, and 20-inch (Rodman) and 10-, 13- and\r\n15-inch mortars. No 15-inch mortars have been yet cast. The 24-pounder\r\nflank defense howitzer, as well as the 8- and 10-inch smooth-bored\r\nRodman and the 10-inch sea-coast mortar, no longer belong to the system,\r\nand are no more to be cast. The 13-inch smooth-bore is an experimental\r\ngun, not more than two or three of which have been cast. The\r\nsmooth-bored gun principally used in the naval service is the Dahlgren.\r\n(See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.) The carronade is now little employed.\r\n\r\n_Rifled Cannon._--The rifled cannon adopted for the land service of the\r\nUnited States at the present time (1880) are, for the field service a 3-\r\nand 3¹⁄₂-inch rifle, having the exterior shape of Rodman guns, but made\r\nof wrought iron,--the former adopted in 1861; the 3¹⁄₂-inch gun has\r\nnever been made--the model was adopted in 1870,--and three mitrailleurs,\r\nviz., 1-inch and ¹⁄₂-inch (Gatling), adopted in 1868, and a .45-inch\r\nGatling, adopted in 1874, intended to replace the ¹⁄₂-inch, and to use\r\nthe service cartridge of the rifle musket. In the siege service there is\r\nbut one rifle gun properly belonging to the system of the United States,\r\nviz., 4¹⁄₂-inch, of casting, having the Rodman shape, but cast solid.\r\nThe 30-pounder (4.2-inch) Parrott so extensively used is not a\r\nregulation gun. (See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.) The weight of the\r\n4¹⁄₂-inch is 3570 pounds. It has an extreme length of 133 inches. The\r\ntwist is uniform, and the weight of the solid projectile 32¹⁄₂ pounds,\r\nand of the charge 3¹⁄₄ pounds. The piece is loaded at the muzzle. The\r\nrifled sea-coast guns belonging to the system are a 10- and 12-inch,\r\nmade of cast iron, and weighing 40,681 and 52,000 pounds respectively.\r\nThe extreme length of the 10-inch is 180, and of the 12-inch 192 inches;\r\nthe weight of the solid shot, 292 and 620 pounds respectively; the twist\r\nin each is uniform, and both are muzzle-loaders. Such is the official\r\nsystem of the United States. All the large guns are cast iron and are\r\nnow useless as an armament to cope with modern armed ironclads. We have,\r\nhowever, a number of experimental guns, the models of which must be our\r\nimmediate reliance in case of foreign war. In making these experimental\r\nrifles it has been held in view to utilize as far as possible the\r\ncast-iron ordnance now on hand. They are all made of cast-iron cases\r\nfitted with internal tubes of wrought iron (steel has also been used)\r\nafter the plans of Parsons and Palliser. (See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION\r\nOF.) The 12¹⁄₄-inch rifle, muzzle-loader, is an original construction,\r\nthe case required being larger than the 15-inch smooth-bored. The weight\r\nof gun is 40 tons; charge, 110 pounds _hexagonal powder_; shot, 700\r\npounds. The others are converted guns,--the 10-inch rifle,\r\nmuzzle-loader, converted from 13-inch smooth-bore by inserting\r\nwrought-iron tube; two patterns of 8-inch rifle, breech- and\r\nmuzzle-loaders, converted from 10-inch smooth-bores by muzzle and breech\r\ninsertion of tubes. Quite a number of the muzzle-loaders have been made\r\nand mounted. A similar gun has been made for the naval service by\r\nconverting the 11-inch Dahlgren. Parrott 100-pounders have also been\r\nconverted into 6.4-inch breech-loaders for the navy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Parrott gun does not belong to the system adopted by the\r\nUnited States, it has been much employed for both siege and sea-coast\r\npurposes, almost to the exclusion of other rifled cannon. They are also\r\nvery generally used in the naval service. There are eight of these guns\r\nemployed in the service of the United States, viz.: a 300-pounder\r\n(10-inch), 200-pounder (8-inch), and 100-pounder (6.4-inch), in use by\r\nboth land and naval forces; a 60-pounder (5.3-inch) and 30-pounder\r\n(4.2-inch), used exclusively by the navy, and a 30-pounder (4.2-inch),\r\n20-pounder (3.67-inch), and 10-pounder (3-inch), employed exclusively by\r\nthe land forces. The Parrott cannon are all muzzle-loading and made of\r\ncast iron, reinforced with a wrought-iron jacket. See ORDNANCE,\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN.--The cannon employed in the British service are all\r\nrifled, and nearly all muzzle-loaders.\r\n\r\n_Royal Arsenal, Woolwich._--The guns belonging to the British system,\r\nand made at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, are: for land service, an\r\n11-inch gun, wrought iron, muzzle-loading, weighing 25 tons; two 7-inch,\r\nweighing 7 tons, and differing slightly in length and details of\r\nconstruction; a 16-pounder (3.6-inch), weighing 12 cwt.; and a 9-pounder\r\n(3-inch), weighing 8 cwt. These guns are all made of wrought iron. There\r\nare also an 8-inch howitzer weighing 46 cwt., also of wrought iron, and\r\ntwo converted guns, viz., a 64-pounder (6.29-inch) converted from\r\n32-pounder, and an 80-pounder converted from 68-pounder smooth-bore.\r\nBoth of these guns are of cast iron, with wrought-iron tubes, and were\r\nconverted according to the Palliser method. For the Woolwich 38-ton gun,\r\nsee ARMSTRONG CANNON. For sea service exclusively, there are made at the\r\nWoolwich Arsenal a 12-inch, weighing 35 tons; two 8-inch, weighing 9\r\ntons respectively, of the same length, one having no preponderance, and\r\ndiffering in other details of their construction; two 7-inch, weighing\r\n6.5 tons respectively, differing slightly in length and details; a\r\n7-inch, weighing 4.5 tons; and 9-pounder (3-inch), weighing 6 cwt. These\r\nguns are all made of wrought iron, and are muzzle-loading. For both land\r\nand sea service, there are made at the Royal Arsenal a 12-inch, weighing\r\n25 tons; a 10-inch, weighing 18 tons; two 9-inch, one of which has no\r\npreponderance, the other a preponderance of 5 cwt.; three 64-pounders\r\n(6.3-inch), each weighing 64 cwt., but differing in length and\r\nconstruction. These guns are all made of wrought iron; for both services\r\nis used a 64-pounder (6.29 inch), converted from 8-inch smooth-bored\r\naccording to the Palliser method. There are besides two bronze guns, one\r\ncalled the “boat gun,” a 7-pounder (3-inch) weighing 200 pounds; the\r\nother a 9-pounder (3-inch), used in the Indian service, and weighing 8\r\ncwt.; also a 7-pounder (3-inch) mountain gun of steel, and weighing 150\r\npounds; these are all muzzle-loaders. The 9-, 10-, 11-, and 12-inch\r\ncalibers have all steel tubes; one 7-ton and one 6.5-ton gun have tubes\r\nof wrought iron.\r\n\r\n_Armstrong Cannon._--The guns used in the British service made by Sir\r\nWilliam Armstrong are--for the land service--a 12-inch weighing 38 tons\r\n(some of these guns are bored to 12¹⁄₂ inches), an 11-inch weighing 25\r\ntons, a 7-inch weighing 7 tons, a 40-pounder (4.75-inch) weighing 35\r\ncwt., a 25-pounder (4-inch), and a 16-pounder (3.6 inch) weighing 18 and\r\n12 cwt. respectively, a 9-pounder (3-inch) weighing 6 cwt., a 10-inch\r\nweighing 6 tons, having no preponderance. These guns are all of wrought\r\niron and muzzle-loading. There are also used in the land service, and of\r\nthe same make, a 7-pounder (3-inch) muzzle-loading steel gun weighing\r\n150 pounds, an 8-inch muzzle-loading howitzer made of wrought iron and\r\nweighing 46 cwt., a 64-pounder (6.29-inch) converted from 32-pounder,\r\nand an 80-pounder (6.29-inch) converted by Palliser method from\r\n68-pounder muzzle-loading, made of cast iron with wrought-iron tubes.\r\nThe other guns manufactured by Sir William Armstrong, and used in the\r\nland service, are all breech-loading, viz.: a 7-inch (screw) weighing 72\r\ncwt., a 20-pounder (3.75-inch screw) weighing 16 cwt., a 64-pounder\r\n(6.4-inch wedge) weighing 64 cwt., and a Gatling gun (0.45) weighing 3\r\ncwt. 84 pounds. The guns used in the sea service of this make are a\r\n12-inch weighing 35 tons, an 8-inch weighing 9 tons, two 7-inch weighing\r\n6 tons 10 cwt. and 90 cwt. respectively, and a 9-pounder (3-inch)\r\nweighing 6 cwt. These are all muzzle-loading, and made of wrought iron.\r\nThere is another muzzle loading gun used for sea service, viz., a\r\n64-pounder (6.29-inch) converted from 8-inch, and weighing 71 cwt.; this\r\ngun is of cast iron with a wrought iron tube. The breech-loaders used\r\nfor sea service are two 20-pounders (3.75-inch screw) weighing 15 and 13\r\ncwt. respectively, 40-pounder (4.75-inch) wedge weighing 32 cwt., and a\r\nGatling gun (0.65-inch) weighing 7 cwt. 35 pounds; these guns are all of\r\nwrought iron. For land and sea service are constructed a 12-inch\r\nweighing 25 tons, a 10- and 9-inch weighing 18 and 12 tons respectively,\r\na 64-pounder (6.3-inch) weighing 64 cwt., a 9-pounder (3-inch) weighing\r\n8 cwt., a 7-pounder (3-inch) weighing 200 pounds, and made of steel; the\r\nothers are of wrought iron, and all are muzzle-loading. The\r\nbreech-loading guns of this manufacture used in both land and sea\r\nservice are a 7-inch (screw) weighing 82 cwt., two 40-pounders\r\n(4.75-inch) screw weighing 35 and 32 cwt., respectively, a 12-pounder\r\n(3-inch), 9-pounder (3-inch), and 6-pounder (2.5-inch) screw weighing 8,\r\n6, and 3 cwt. respectively. They are all made of wrought iron. See\r\nARMSTRONG GUN.\r\n\r\nGERMANY.--In Germany the Krupp gun is almost entirely employed; they are\r\nall breech-loading and constructed of steel. (For particular\r\nconstruction, see ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.) Those used in the German\r\nland service are a 28-centimetre howitzer weighing 9.82 tons, caliber\r\nin inches 11.023, a long 21-centimetre weighing 9.84 tons, caliber 8.241\r\ninches, a short 21-centimetre weighing 8.84, caliber 8.241 inches, a\r\nshort 15-centimetre weighing 2.9 tons, caliber 5.869 inches, a 12-, 9-,\r\n8-, and 6-centimetre, whose calibers are 4.735, 3.602, 3.090, and 2.362\r\ninches, and whose weights are 1.37 tons, and 935, 649, and 235 pounds\r\nrespectively. In the sea service are used a 30¹⁄₂-centimetre weighing\r\n35.3 tons, caliber 12.007 inches, a short 26-centimetre weighing 17.67\r\ntons, caliber 10.236 inches, a long 24-centimetre weighing 14.38 tons,\r\ncaliber 9.267 inches, and a short 24-centimetre. For both land and sea\r\nservice are employed a long 17-centimetre weighing 5.5 tons, caliber\r\n6.771 inches, a short 17-centimetre, a long 15-centimetre weighing 3.03\r\ntons, caliber 5.869 inches, and a long 15-centimetre weighing 3.09 tons.\r\n\r\nFRANCE.--The guns adopted in the French service are both breech- and\r\nmuzzle-loading, and are, for the land service, a siege-gun, 24-pounder\r\nrifled breech-loading, weighing 40.55 tons, caliber 6.01 inches, for\r\nfortress guns a 24- and 12-pounder rifled muzzle-loading, weighing 5953\r\nand 3307 pounds, and having calibers of 6.01 and 4.77 inches\r\nrespectively. For siege-guns a 24- and 12-pounder rifled weighing 4409\r\nand 1940 pounds, whose respective calibers are 6.01 and 4.77 inches and\r\nmuzzle-loading. For field artillery a 12-, 8-, and 4-pounder rifled,\r\nweighing respectively 1367, 1234.6, and 727.55 pounds, and whose\r\ncalibers are 4.77, 4.17, and 3.40 inches respectively, all\r\nmuzzle-loading. There is also a 4-pounder rifled muzzle-loading mountain\r\npiece weighing 220.5 pounds, whose caliber is 3.40 inches. In the\r\nsea-coast service there are a 30-pounder (muzzle-loader) not hooped,\r\nweighing 61 cwt., caliber 6.48 inches, a 30-pounder (muzzle-loader or\r\nbreech-loader) hooped, weighing 70.86 cwt., caliber 5.46 inches, a\r\nhowitzer 22-centimetre rifled and hooped, caliber 8.66 inches. In the\r\nFrench sea-service are a 32-centimetre weighing 34.5 tons, caliber\r\n12.599 inches, and a 27-centimetre weighing 21.7 tons, caliber 10.803\r\ninches. Both of these guns are breech-loading. For both land and sea\r\nservice are used a 24-centimetre weighing 13.8 tons, caliber 9.499\r\ninches, a 19-centimetre weighing 7.9 tons, caliber 7.638 inches, a\r\n16-centimetre weighing 98.42 cwt., caliber 6.484 inches, a 14-centimetre\r\nweighing 52.26 cwt., caliber 5.456 inches. The guns used for sea service\r\nonly, or for both land and sea service, are all made of cast iron, tubed\r\nwith steel nearly to the trunnions, and strengthened near the breech by\r\nsteel rings heated and shrunk on. The fortress guns, most of the siege,\r\nand all the field-guns are made of bronze. The large breech-loaders use\r\nthe solid breech-screw _fermeture_. The term “pounder” as applied to\r\ncertain guns has no reference to the weight of the oblong projectile\r\nused, but to the weight of the corresponding spherical solid shot.\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.--In the Russian service the Krupp gun is rapidly taking the\r\nplace of all others; there are, however, still used for sea service, a\r\n12-inch and 6-inch breech-loader weighing 40 tons and 3.92 tons\r\nrespectively; also a 12.2-pounder boat-gun weighing 792 pounds, and for\r\nboth land and sea service an 8-inch breech-loader weighing 8.754 tons,\r\nand an 8-inch breech-loading mortar, weighing 3.21 tons. These guns are\r\nall made of steel.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance, Ammunition for.= For convenience in loading and safety in\r\ntransportation, cannon ammunition is prepared in a peculiar manner and\r\nwith great care. The ammunition so prepared is classified into field and\r\nmountain, siege and sea-coast ammunition.\r\n\r\n_Ammunition for Field Service_ is composed of solid shot, shells,\r\nspherical case-shot, and canister-shot (see headings). In mountain\r\nservice solid shot are omitted. A stand of ammunition is composed of the\r\nprojectile, sabot, straps, cartridge-bag, cylinder, and cap. The\r\nprojectile is secured by two tin straps, fastened at the ends with tacks\r\ndriven into the sabot. The straps cross each other at right angles; for\r\nsolid shot, one strap passing through a slit in the other; for hollow\r\nprojectiles, both straps are fastened to a tin ring which surrounds the\r\nfuze-hole. A round of canister for the field service consists of a tin\r\ncylinder filled with cast-iron shot, which slips over the end of the\r\nsabot, to which it is secured with small nails. The materials of which\r\ncartridge-bags are made are flannel, wildbore, or serge; the fabric\r\nshould be soft and closely woven, to prevent the powder sifting out.\r\nFabrics of cotton and flax are not used, because the powder sifts\r\nthrough them, and they are more apt to leave fire in the gun than woolen\r\nstuffs. A cartridge-bag for the field service is made of two pieces,--a\r\nrectangular piece for the sides, and a circular piece for the bottom.\r\nThe charge is determined by measurement. The cylinder and cap are made\r\nof stout paper. The cylinder is used to give stiffness to the cartridge\r\nat the junction of the sabot and bag; the cap covers the exposed portion\r\nof the bag, is drawn off before loading, and placed over the projectile,\r\nor thrown away. The cartridge-bag is attached to the projectile by tying\r\nit around the grooves of the sabot with twine.\r\n\r\n_Fixed Ammunition._--Ammunition thus prepared is called fixed\r\nammunition. It is used in the field and mountain service for smooth-bore\r\nguns and howitzers. For rifled guns the bag and projectile are carried\r\nseparately. The term _strapped ammunition_ is applied when the\r\nprojectile is attached to a sabot without grooves; and to give a proper\r\nform to the cartridge-bag, the mouth is closed with a cartridge-block,\r\nwhich resembles a sabot; hence the name strapped ammunition. This kind\r\nof cartridge is nearly obsolete.\r\n\r\n_Packing, etc._--As soon as ammunition is finished it should be gauged,\r\nto see that it is of the proper caliber; it is afterwards packed in\r\nboxes containing 10 rounds each.\r\n\r\n_Siege and Sea-coast Ammunition._--On account of the great weight of\r\nsiege and sea-coast ammunition, the cartridge-bag and projectile are\r\ncarried separately. The cartridge-bags for large charges of powder are\r\nmade of two pieces of woolen stuff, or of a paper tube with a woolen\r\ncloth bottom. The former are preferred for rapid firing. For sea-coast\r\nhowitzers the bag should fill the chamber; if the piece be fired with a\r\nreduced charge, a cartridge-block should be inserted into the bag to\r\ngive it proper size. For mortars the bag is only used to carry the\r\npowder, and when the piece is loaded, the powder is poured into the\r\nchamber; bags of any suitable size will answer for this service. For\r\nhot-shot cartridges bags are made double, by putting one bag within\r\nanother. Care should be taken to see that the bags are free from holes.\r\nFor ricochet firing, or other occasions when very small charges are\r\nrequired, a cartridge-bag of inferior caliber may be used. In the siege\r\nand sea-coast services, solid shot are transported and loaded loosely,\r\nbut hollow projectiles are strapped to sabots, to prevent the fuze from\r\ncoming in contact with the powder of the charge. The sabots are made\r\nfrom thick plank, and the straps are fastened as in the field service.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance, Carriages for.= The carriages for cannon may be classified\r\nfrom their use into field, mountain, prairie, and sea-coast carriages,\r\nand mortar-beds. (See particular headings.) They may be further divided\r\ninto those required for the immediate service and transportation of\r\ncannon, as gun-carriages and mortar-beds, and those employed for the\r\ntransportation of ammunition, implements and materials for repairs, as\r\ncaissons, mortar-wagons, forges, and battery-wagons. The field-,\r\nmountain-, prairie-, and siege-carriages being required for the\r\ntransportation of their pieces are similar in their construction; those\r\nfor sea-coast purposes differ materially from the others.\r\n\r\n_Nomenclature of Artillery Carriage._--The principal parts of the\r\nfield-carriage and of all artillery carriages, other than the sea-coast,\r\nare: stock, of squared wood in two pieces, which serves to connect the\r\ngun-carriage with the limber, and to direct the piece; it includes the\r\nhead, to which the sponge-bucket ring is attached; groove, trail, or\r\ncurved part of the stock, which rest on the ground when the piece is\r\nunlimbered; rounding of the trail, trail-plate, a piece of iron fastened\r\nto the end of the trail and terminated by a very strong ring, called the\r\nlunette, which receives the pintle-hook by which the limber is attached;\r\npointing-rings, large and small, which receive the hand-spike;\r\ntrail-handles, on each side of the stock for the purpose of raising it;\r\nprolonge-hooks, on which the prolonge is coiled; wheel-guard plates,\r\nlock-chain, used to keep the wheel from turning; it is on the side of\r\nthe carriage, and has an eye-plate and bolt; sponge and rammer stop,\r\nsponge-chain and hasp, ear-plate for sponge-chain and hasp; ear-plate to\r\nsupport worm; key-chain and key; elevating-screw; the latter has a\r\nhandle with four prongs; elevating-screw box, elevating-screw bed,\r\nrondelles, which connect cheeks and stock; cheeks, two pieces of wood\r\nbetween which the gun rests; washer-hooks for handspike, washer-hook for\r\nlock-chain, under-strap, right sponge-hook, sponge and worm-hook,\r\nhandspike-rings, trunnion-plates, into the beds or depressions of which\r\nthe trunnions fit; cap-squares, cap-square chain, key-chain and key.\r\nAxle, including axle-body, of wood; axle-tree, of iron, axle-arm, the\r\nrounded extremities of the axle-tree on which the wheels revolve;\r\nlinch-pin, linch-pin washer and hook. Wheels; each includes nave,\r\nnave-bands, nave-box, spokes, felloes, tire. In the new model for field\r\nservice, cannoneers’ seats are on the axle between the cheeks and\r\nwheels; each consists of an iron chair supported on a rectangular bar\r\ninserted in a vertical iron socket, and resting on a strong steel\r\nspring; the socket is supported by two brass braces fastened to the axle\r\nby axle-straps; to an iron cross-piece at the top of the socket are\r\nattached two iron braces, which help to support the iron foot-rest\r\nattached to the brass braces. The chair has arms and faces to the trail.\r\nThis refers to the carriage proper, considered only in relation to the\r\nfire of the piece, or as a two-wheeled carriage. To suit it to the easy\r\nand rapid transportation of its load it must be converted into a\r\nfour-wheeled carriage, which is done by attaching it to another\r\ntwo-wheeled carriage called a limber.\r\n\r\nThe _limber_ consists of a similar axle-body, axle, and two wheels, and\r\non these rests a frame-work, to receive the tongue. On top of the whole\r\nis an ammunition-box, the top of which forms a seat for three\r\ncannoneers. In rear of the axle-tree is a pintle-hook to receive the\r\nlunette of the trail. Connected with the frame-work in front is a fixed\r\nsplinter-bar with four hooks, to which are attached the traces of the\r\nwheel horses. At the extremity of the tongue are placed two pole-chains,\r\nby which the tongue or pole is held up, and a pole-yoke with two movable\r\nbranches, to prevent, as much as possible, the pole from oscillating and\r\nstriking the horses. The principal parts of a field-limber are: pole,\r\nincluding pole-pad; pole-straps, by which the pole is guided when the\r\nteam is hitched; pole-strap iron, pole-yoke, muff and collar, pole-yoke\r\nbranches, to which are attached sliding-rings; splinter-bar, to which\r\nthe horses are hitched by four trace-hooks; end-bands, middle-bands,\r\npole-prop, including socket, ferrule, and chain; hounds, pieces of wood\r\nupon which the chests rest, connecting the axle-body with the\r\nsplinter-bar; forks, pieces of wood between the hounds, forming an\r\nopening in which the pole is placed; fork-strap, foot-boards,\r\nfoot-board brackets, chest, chest-handles, cover, of wood; cover-plate,\r\nof copper; turnbuckle, hasp, back-stay, front-stay, stay-pins, stay-pin\r\nkeys, under strap, pintle-hook, on rear part of axle-tree, which\r\nattaches the limber to the carriage; pintle-hook key, axle, wheels. The\r\nfield-carriages employed in the U. S. service are three, one for the\r\n3-inch rifle carriage (which, with slight modifications, is adapted to\r\nthe 1-inch mitrailleur), one for the 12-pounder, and one for the\r\n¹⁄₂-inch and .45-inch mitrailleur. The corresponding parts of these\r\ncarriages differ only in their dimensions. All limbers are similar.\r\n\r\n_Mountain-Carriage._--The mountain-carriage differs in construction from\r\nthe field-carriage inasmuch as the stocks and cheeks are formed of the\r\nsame piece by hollowing out the head of the stock, the wheels are\r\nsmaller and the axle-tree is made of wood, the arms being protected from\r\nwear by skeans. It is arranged for draught by attaching a pair of shafts\r\nto the trail. The pack-saddle and its harness are constructed to carry\r\nseverally the howitzer and shafts, the carriage, or two\r\nammunition-chests; or it enables an animal to draw the carriage with the\r\nhowitzer mounted upon it.\r\n\r\n_Prairie-Carriage._--The prairie-carriage is designed to carry the\r\nmountain howitzer, and is similar to the mountain-carriage in form; but\r\nbeing exclusively for draught, the axle-tree is of iron, and the wheels\r\nare made higher and the distance between them greater than in the\r\nmountain-carriage. It has a limber and is drawn by two horses abreast,\r\nas in field-carriages. The ammunition is packed in mountain\r\nammunition-chests, two of which are carried on the limber.\r\n\r\n_Siege-Carriages._--There are three different kinds of siege-carriages\r\nused in the U. S. service, one for the 4¹⁄₂-inch rifle, another on which\r\nthe 30-pounder Parrott is mounted, and a third for the 8-inch howitzer,\r\nbeing the old 12-pounder, 18-pounder, and 24-pounder siege-carriages\r\nmodified; these are all constructed in the same manner, and differ only\r\nin their dimensions. Siege-carriages are similar to the field-carriage\r\nin construction (see FIELD-CARRIAGE), the principal difference being in\r\nthe manner in which they are joined to the limbers. Projecting upwards\r\nfrom the limber and in rear of the axle-tree is placed a pintle, which\r\nenters a hole made in the trail from the under side, and a lashing chain\r\nand hook keep the two parts together when once in position; the weight\r\nof the stock bearing on the rear of the limber relieves the horses of\r\nthe weight of the pole, which is long and heavy. On the upper surface of\r\nthe cheeks near the rear ends are placed two projecting bolts, which\r\nwith the curve of the cheeks form resting-places for the trunnions, when\r\nthe piece is in position for transportation. They are called traveling\r\ntrunnion-beds. When the piece is in this position the breech rests upon\r\nthe bolster, which is a curved block of wood bolted to the upper side of\r\nthe stock.\r\n\r\n_Sea-Coast Carriages_ are divided into barbette front-pintle and\r\nbarbette centre-pintle carriages, casemate, and flank-defense carriages;\r\ndepending upon the part of the work in which they are mounted. The\r\ncasemate-carriage differs from the barbette in being much lower.\r\nSea-coast carriages are now chiefly made of wrought iron. All are\r\ncomposed of two principal parts, viz.: the gun-carriage and chassis. The\r\ngun-carriage is composed of two cheeks, held together by two plates of\r\nboiler-iron, called the front and rear transoms respectively. Each cheek\r\nis formed of two pieces of boiler-iron cut to a triangular shape,\r\nseparated at the edges by interposing the vertical portion or web of a\r\nT-shaped bar. The horizontal branches project over each side to form a\r\ndouble rim, which gives stiffness to the cheeks. Flat bars of iron are\r\nalso placed between the plates at suitable intervals to stiffen the\r\ncheeks in the direction in which the weight and recoil of the piece bear\r\nupon them. All these parts are held together by screw-bolts. The motion\r\nto and from battery is regulated in the 8- and 10-inch carriages by a\r\npair of eccentric truck-wheels, called manœuvring-wheels, which work on\r\nan axle-tree placed underneath and a little in front of the centre of\r\nthe trunnions. When it becomes necessary to check the recoil of the\r\ngun-carriage, the wheels are thrown out of gear by means of a handspike\r\ninserted in the socket attached to the end of the axle-tree, and the\r\ncarriage moved on sliding friction. When the gun is to be moved into\r\nbattery, the wheels are thrown into gear in a similar manner, and the\r\nfront of the carriage moves on rolling friction. The manœuvring-wheels\r\nmentioned above are fixed on the projecting ends of the axle-tree, the\r\naxis of the wheel being eccentric with the axis of the axle-tree. These\r\neccentrics are so arranged that when the centres of the wheels are at\r\ntheir lowest points, the surfaces of the wheels bear on the rails of the\r\nchassis, and raise the gun-carriage from it; and when the centres are at\r\ntheir highest points, the surfaces of the wheels do not touch the rails,\r\nand the gun-carriage is in contact with them. In case there is no socket\r\nconnected with the end of the axle-tree, the wheel is thrown into or out\r\nof gear, that is, made to bear on the rail of the chassis, or relieved\r\nfrom it, by turning the axle-tree with a wrench placed on the hexagonal\r\nend. In the 15-inch carriage there are two pairs of manœuvring-wheels,\r\none pair being placed in front as above described, and the other pair\r\nnear the rear end of the carriage. In all sea-coast carriages except the\r\nflank casemate the elevation and depression are given by a lever, the\r\npoint of which works in a ratchet cut in the breech of the piece. The\r\nfulcrum (ratchet-post) is made of cast iron and rests on the rear\r\ntransom of the gun-carriage. It has several notches for adjusting the\r\nposition of the elevating bar. The chassis is a movable railway on which\r\nthe gun-carriage moves to and from battery. It is composed of two\r\nwrought-iron rails inclined 3° to the horizon, and united by transoms as\r\nin the gun-carriage. In addition to the transoms, there are several\r\ndiagonal braces to give stiffness to the chassis. For the 10-inch and\r\nsmaller carriages, the chassis-rails are single beams of rolled iron, 15\r\ninches deep; for all calibers above, the rails are made of long\r\nrectangular pieces of boiler-plate and T-iron, in a manner similar to\r\nthat of the cheeks of the gun-carriage. In order to move the carriage\r\nhorizontally in the operation of aiming the piece, the chassis is\r\nsupported on traverse wheels, which roll on circular plates of iron,\r\nfastened to a bed of solid masonry, called the traverse circles. The\r\nmotion of the gun-carriage is checked front and rear, by pieces of iron\r\nbolted to the top of the rails, called hurters and counter-hurters; and\r\nit is prevented from slipping off sideways by friction rollers and\r\nguides, which are bolted to the cheeks and transoms. In a late\r\nmodification of the 15-inch carriage, the front eccentric axle is\r\nreplaced by an ordinary one, dispensing with axle-pawls and\r\nfriction-bands, the handspike pawls are made double instead of single,\r\nwith a spring to keep them out of the ratchets, the front set of\r\ntransoms and diagonal braces are removed from the chassis, and pneumatic\r\nor hydraulic buffers to check the recoil are put in with thick braces.\r\nWhen the rear manœuvring-wheels are out of gear, the top carriage\r\ntouches the rails of the chassis and moves on sliding friction, and when\r\nthey are in gear the front wheels are also made to touch the rails and\r\nthe top carriage moves on rolling friction. To prevent the rear\r\nmanœuvring-wheels from working out of gear while the gun is being run\r\nfrom battery, or jumping in gear when the gun is fired, pawls are\r\nprovided for locking the rear axle. When no pawls are provided for\r\nlocking the eccentric axle, it is often necessary for one cannoneer to\r\nremain embarred in the axle-socket to prevent the axle from flying out\r\nof gear. The 15-inch carriage allows an elevation of about 32° and a\r\ndepression of about 6°, unless when fitted with pneumatic buffers, when\r\nno more than 25° elevation can be given. With the hydraulic buffer which\r\npasses along the centre of the chassis and is little used in the U. S.\r\nservice the elevation is still further diminished. The 10-inch rifle and\r\n13-inch smooth-bore are used with the 13-inch carriage, and the 12-inch\r\nrifle and 15-inch smooth-bore on the 15-inch carriage; the 20-inch gun\r\nhas a separate carriage. The flank-casemate carriage is adapted to the\r\nmounting of the 24-pounder iron howitzer in the flanks of casemate\r\nbatteries. Several modifications have been introduced into the carriages\r\nfor the experimental rifled guns. For the largest calibers the\r\nchassis-rails are deeper in rear than in front. The pintle, set in a\r\nheavy flanged block of cast iron, is in front of the chassis, to which\r\nit is attached by a strap or heavy plate of iron. The top carriage is\r\nmanœuvred by chain-gearing worked by a capstan near the rear of the\r\nchassis. The elevation is given by a wheel with projecting spokes on the\r\nside of the top carriage, which is geared to work a toothed arc attached\r\nto the breech of the gun, the reading being given by a pointer on a\r\ndial-plate above the wheel. Rubber buffers are placed at the rear\r\ntransom of the chassis to assist the cylinders to take up the recoil.\r\nFriction-plates attached by india-rubber ends to the rear transom take\r\nthe place of cylinders in certain smaller carriages. In some cases the\r\ntraverse-wheels are made to relieve the pintle of part of the strain by\r\ngrooving them to run on heavy traverse-rails and inclining them towards\r\nthe pintle.\r\n\r\n_Mortar-Beds._--Mortars are fired from a bed; in the U. S. service there\r\nare three kinds of mortar-beds in use in the siege service; the 8-inch,\r\n10-inch, and the Coehorn; the first two differ only in dimensions. They\r\nare made of wrought iron and put together after the manner of the\r\nsea-coast gun-carriage. The different parts are the cheeks, which, like\r\nthose of the gun-carriage, are triangular in shape, and two transoms\r\nconnecting the cheeks together. At the end of each cheek are\r\nprojections, called front and rear notches, underneath which the\r\ncannoneers embar with their handspikes to move the bed on the platform;\r\nthere are also two front and two rear manœuvring-bolts for the same\r\npurpose. The elevation and depression are given as in the gun-carriage\r\nby embarring with the iron elevating bar through the fulcrum into the\r\nratchets on the breech of the mortar. The Coehorn-bed is made of a block\r\nof oak wood, in one piece, or two pieces joined together with bolts. A\r\nrecess for the trunnions and part of the breech is made in the top of\r\nthe bed, and the trunnions are kept in their places by plates of iron\r\nbolted down over them. Two iron handles are bolted to the bed on each\r\nside, by which four men can carry the bed with the mortar in its place,\r\nthe entire weight being only 296 pounds. Sea-coast mortar-beds are\r\nsimilar to those for siege purposes, but they have eccentric\r\ntruck-wheels for manœuvring the mortar-bed on the platform and the\r\nmanœuvring-bolts are omitted. The 13-inch sea-coast mortar is now\r\nmounted upon a centre pintle-carriage. The usual bed, now become the top\r\ncarriage, is placed upon a chassis resting on a platform. The top\r\ncarriage has a crane attached to the left cheek, and to the inside of\r\nthe right cheek is attached a pawl worked from the front, for locking\r\nthe eccentric axle in and out of gear, and the carriage is strengthened\r\nby an additional rear transom about 5 inches wide, the pipe being\r\nomitted. The chassis has the usual appliance for throwing this class of\r\ncarriages into gear, and in addition an eccentric axle placed at right\r\nangles to and supported by a double front transom, and carrying a\r\ntraverse wheel, by means of which motion is communicated to the\r\nchassis. The chassis is otherwise transomed and braced in accordance\r\nwith the system. Heretofore nearly all sea-coast carriages were made of\r\nwood, but in consequence of the great difficulty of preserving this\r\nmaterial from decay, especially when exposed to the dampness of\r\ncasemates, they have nearly all been replaced by wrought iron. The\r\ncarriages principally employed for the transportation of ammunition,\r\nimplements, and materials for repairs, are caissons, mortar-wagons,\r\nforges, and battery-wagons.\r\n\r\n_The Caisson._--Caissons are used for conveying ammunition for a\r\nfield-battery; all are similar in form. It is a four-wheeled carriage,\r\nconsisting of two parts, one of which is a limber similar to that of the\r\ngun-carriage, and connected in a similar way by a wooden stock and\r\nlunette. On the axle-body of the rear part and parallel to the stock are\r\nplaced three rails, upon which are fastened two ammunition-chests, one\r\nbehind the other, and similar to the one on the limber; so that the\r\ncaisson has three ammunition-chests, which will seat 9 cannoneers. The\r\ninterior compartments of the ammunition-chests vary according to the\r\nnature of the ammunition with which they are loaded. In rear of the last\r\nchest is placed a spare-wheel axle of iron, with a chain and toggle at\r\nthe end of it. On the rear end of the middle rail is placed a carriage\r\nhook similar to a pintle-hook, to which the lunette of a gun-carriage\r\nwhose limber has become disabled may be attached, and the gun carried\r\noff the field. The caisson has the same turning capacity and mobility as\r\nthe gun-carriage, so that it can follow the piece in all its manœuvres,\r\nif necessary. It also carries a spare-wheel, spare-pole, etc. The\r\nprincipal parts of the caisson are: stock, or middle-rail; it has an\r\niron lunette on its front end; side-rails, front foot-board, rear\r\nfoot-board, middle-chest, rear-chest, spare-wheel axle; it has a body,\r\ntwo ribs, and a chain and toggle to secure the wheel; there are also two\r\nstays for the axle; lock-chains, fastened to lock-chain bridles under\r\nthe front ends of the side-rails, and held up by lock-chain hooks\r\nfastened to the outside of the side-rails; spare-pole, spare-pole key,\r\nkey-plate, chain, and pin; the key-plate is fastened to the under side\r\nof the lunette; the key is attached to the left side of the stock by a\r\nchain and eye-pin; carriage-hook, for attaching a carriage that has lost\r\nits limber; wheel-guard plates, spare-pole ring, held by the axle-strap;\r\nring-bolt for spare hand-spike, key-plate and key, on the right side of\r\nthe middle-rail; key-plate, chain, and key for the shovel-handle, on the\r\ninside of the right side-rail; middle assembling-bar, of iron; it has\r\ntwo ears in the middle to serve as stay-plates for the middle-chests,\r\nand a slot for the axe on the right of the middle-rail; rear\r\nassembling-bar; it supports the spare-wheel axle, and has a slot for the\r\npickaxe on the left of the middle-rail. Axle, the axle-body, being\r\nnotched to receive the middle-rail and tenoned to fit into the notches\r\nin the side-rails; staples for tool-handles; they are driven into the\r\ntop of the axle-body in front of the iron axle-tree, one for the\r\nshovel-handle near the right side-rail, the other for the handle of the\r\npickaxe on the left of the middle-rail. Wheels of all artillery\r\ncarriages are similarly constructed; they differ, however, in the size\r\nand strength of certain parts, depending on the size of the carriage to\r\nwhich they are attached. The principal parts are: the nave, the\r\nnave-bands, the nave-box, the spokes, the felloes, and the tire. The\r\nnave constitutes the central portion of the wheel, and distributes the\r\npressure of the axle-arm to the spokes. It is generally made of a single\r\npiece of wood, and strengthened by four iron bands called the\r\nnave-bands. It is also pierced with a conical hole for the axle-arm; and\r\nto diminish wear and friction, it is lined with a box of brass or cast\r\niron, called the nave-box. The spokes serve to transmit the pressure of\r\nthe load to the rim of the wheel. In all artillery carriages there are\r\nseven felloes and fourteen spokes. The felloes are the wooden segments\r\nwhich form the rim, and are joined together at their ends by wooden\r\npins, or dowels. The tire is a strong band of iron, shrunk tightly\r\naround the felloes, to hold them together, and protect the rim from\r\nwearing away by contact with the ground.\r\n\r\n_Mortar-wagons_ are designed for the transportation of siege-mortars and\r\ntheir beds, or of guns or large shot, and shells. A limber similar to\r\nthe one for siege-gun carriages is used with it. The body consists of a\r\nplatform of rails and transoms resting on an axle-tree. The stock is\r\nformed by prolonging the two middle-rails. The side-rails projecting to\r\nthe rear form supports for the pivots of a windlass-roller. This roller\r\nis used to load guns and mortars on the wagon by drawing them up the\r\nstock. A muzzle-bolster on the stock near the limber, and a\r\nbreech-hurter near the hind part of the wagon, are provided and used\r\nwhen long pieces are transported on it. Mortars are usually carried\r\nmounted on their beds.\r\n\r\nThe _traveling-forge_ is a complete blacksmith’s establishment, which\r\naccompanies a battery for the purpose of making repairs and shoeing\r\nhorses. It consists of a body, upon which is constructed the\r\nbellows-house, etc., and the limber, which supports the stock in\r\ntransportation. The body is composed of two rails, a stock, and an\r\naxle-tree. The bellows-house is divided into the bellows-room and\r\niron-room. Attached to the back of the house is the coal-box, and in\r\nfront of it is the fireplace. From the upper and front part of the\r\nbellows an air-pipe proceeds in a downward direction to the air-box,\r\nwhich is placed behind the fireplace. The vise is permanently attached\r\nto the stock, and the anvil, when in use, is supported on a stone or log\r\nof wood, and when transported is carried on the hearth of the\r\nfireplace. The remaining tools are carried in the limber-chest. When in\r\nworking order the point of the stock is supported by a prop.\r\nNomenclature of the traveling-forge body: Lunette, prop, vise, stock,\r\nwheel-guard plates, stock-stirrup, fireplace, back of fireplace,\r\nair-back, wind-pipe, bellows, ribs, hinges, hook, fulcrum, hook and\r\nstaple, roof of bellows-house, bows, studs, girders, end-boards,\r\nbottom-boards, side-rail, lock-chain hook, coal-box, lid or roof,\r\nhandles, hinges, turnbuckle, and hasp. A new pattern of field-forge has\r\nbeen proposed by Col. Laidley, U. S. Ordnance Corps.\r\n\r\nThe _battery-wagon_ is employed to transport the tools and materials for\r\nrepairs. Among the tools are those for carriage-makers, saddlers,\r\narmorers, and laboratorians’ use, scythes and sickles for cutting\r\nforage, and spare implements for the service of the piece. The body of\r\nthe battery-wagon is a large, rectangular box, covered with a roof of\r\npainted canvas; and to the back part is attached a rack for carrying\r\nforage. The bottom of the body is formed of one middle- and two\r\nside-rails, resting on a stock and axle-tree, as in the traveling-forge.\r\nThe tools and materials of the battery-wagon are carefully packed in the\r\nmanner prescribed by the Ordnance Manual, in order that no difficulty\r\nmay be experienced in finding a particular article when wanted. The\r\nsmaller articles are carried in boxes properly lettered and numbered.\r\nThe traveling-forge and battery-wagon are not confined to the service of\r\nfield-batteries, but are used with siege and sea-coast carriages as\r\noccasion may require. Nomenclature of the battery-wagon body: Lunette,\r\nstock, wheel-guard plate, lock-chain, lock-chain bridle, lock-chain\r\nhook, studs, side-rails, upper rails, hinges, bows, cover-boards,\r\ncover-strap and turnbuckle, hasp, side-boards, stays, bottom-rails,\r\nbottom-boards, cross-bars, forage-rack, including chains, sides, and\r\nbars.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance, Construction of.= The present condition of gun construction\r\nis mainly experimental. Iron in one form or another is the only material\r\nused for heavy artillery, but the particular form in which it is to be\r\nused, whether as cast, wrought, or steel, or whether in bars, coils, or\r\ningots, or in combination,--as, for instance, steel or wrought iron\r\ninterior and cast iron or wire-wrapped or hooped exterior,--is still\r\nundecided, and it is left for experiments which are still in progress,\r\nor to be made hereafter, to decide which is best. In the United States,\r\ncast iron is used for smooth-bore guns, and also for rifle guns, but as\r\nits use for the latter has not proved satisfactory, experiments are now\r\nbeing made with wrought iron lined and with wire-wrapped and other\r\nbuilt-up guns, with fair prospect of success. In England, modern gun\r\nconstruction at one period inclined to the use of a steel or wrought\r\niron interior tube, strengthened by an exterior casting of iron, which\r\nis the system of Palliser and Parsons. But the preference for the\r\ninventions of Sir William Armstrong, improved by those of Fraser, have\r\nresulted in the exclusive use, in that country at present, of the system\r\nof these two inventors. This method of gun construction is, in brief, a\r\nsteel core (or body of the gun) strengthened by three or more exterior\r\ntubes of coiled wrought iron. This system is at present popularly known\r\nas the “Woolwich,” but sometimes called the “Elswick,” from the place\r\nwhere Sir William Armstrong’s works are now located. In Germany and\r\nRussia, and some other European nations, the Krupp system of heavy\r\nforgings of steel ingots is preferred. This last is by far the most\r\nexpensive, and does not always produce the most durable guns. The\r\nquestion of breech- or muzzle-loading is still an undecided one. (See\r\nBREECH-LOADING and BREECH-MECHANISM.) The Germans prefer the first\r\nnamed, as do the French, Austrians, and Russians, for large calibers and\r\nfor most small guns, while the English, after several years’ trial of\r\nthe first, have of late abandoned its use and returned to the\r\nmuzzle-loader, though the question has again been recently agitated. In\r\nthe United States, experiments still going on have not yet demonstrated\r\nwhich principle is the best suited to the gun construction used in\r\nAmerica. The advantages of loading at the breech with heavy guns are\r\nnumerous and great; but the serious mechanical difficulties (see\r\nBREECH-MECHANISM) of perfecting the movable breech attachment have\r\nmilitated against its adoption, especially in a country committed like\r\nthe United States to the use of cast iron. During the half-decade\r\n(1855-60), and the succeeding decade (1860-70), enormous strides were\r\nmade in gun construction and in that of carriages and projectiles, and\r\nthe manufacture of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n_Cast Metal Guns._--The principles which govern the construction of\r\nhomogeneous cast metal guns as established by long practice will be\r\nconsidered under the following heads:\r\n\r\n_Exterior Form._--The exterior of cannon is generally divided into five\r\nprincipal parts, viz.: the breech, the first reinforce, the second\r\nreinforce, the chase, and the swell of the muzzle.\r\n\r\nThe _breech_ (see BREECH) is the thickness of metal in the prolongation\r\nof the axis of the bore, and should be at least equal to one and a\r\nquarter times the diameter of the bore; a less thickness has been found\r\ninsufficient for heavy iron guns.\r\n\r\nThe _first reinforce_ (see REINFORCE) extends from the base-ring to the\r\nseat of the ball, and is the thickest part of the piece, for the reason\r\nthat the pressure of the powder is found to be greatest before the\r\nprojectile is moved far from its place. In shape this reinforce was\r\nformerly made slightly conical, under the impression that the pressure\r\nwas greater at the vent than at the seat of the projectile; but it is\r\nnow made cylindrical throughout. The thickness of bronze cannon at the\r\nseat of the charge is less than for iron guns.\r\n\r\nThe _second reinforce_ (see REINFORCE) connects the first reinforce with\r\nthe chase. It is made considerably thicker than is necessary to resist\r\nthe action of the powder, in order to serve as a proper point of support\r\nfor the trunnions, and to compensate for certain defects of metal liable\r\nto occur in the vicinity of the trunnions of all cast cannon, arising\r\nfrom the crystalline arrangement and unequal cooling of the different\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n_The Chase_ (see CHASE).--From the extremity of the second reinforce\r\ncannon taper more or less rapidly to the vicinity of the muzzle; this\r\npart called the chase constitutes the largest portion of the piece in\r\nfront of the trunnions. The thickness of metal in the chase should be\r\nsufficient to resist the striking of the ball against the side of the\r\nbore. This injury being greater in bronze and soft iron guns, their\r\ntaper is less than in cast-iron cannon. In the construction of bronze\r\nguns, the thickness of metal at the neck or thinnest part is about\r\nfive-elevenths of that at the first reinforce. All projections on the\r\nsurface of cannon not absolutely necessary for the service of the piece\r\nare omitted in cannon of _late models_. This omission simplifies their\r\nconstruction, renders them easier to clean, and obviates certain\r\ninjurious strains that would otherwise arise from unequal cooling in\r\nfabrication.\r\n\r\n_Swell of the Muzzle._--The enlargement called swell of the muzzle was\r\ngenerally regarded as necessary, inasmuch as the metal situated\r\nimmediately at the muzzle is supported only in rear, and it was thought\r\nnecessary to increase its thickness in order to enable it to resist the\r\naction of the projectile at this point. At present, however, the\r\ntendency is to reduce the size of the swell of the muzzle and to omit it\r\nentirely on all sea-coast cannon.\r\n\r\n_Interior Form of Cannon._--The interior of a cannon may be divided into\r\nthree distinct parts, viz.: the vent, or channel which communicates with\r\nthe charge; the seat of the charge or chamber, if its diameter be\r\ndifferent from the rest of the bore, and the cylinder, or that portion\r\nof the bore passed over by the projectile (see appropriate headings).\r\n\r\nThe _vent_ (see VENT) is perpendicular to the axis of the piece, and the\r\ninterior orifice is at a distance from the bottom of the chamber equal\r\nto a quarter of its diameter, or at the junction of the sides of the\r\nchamber with the curve of the bottom. Experiment has shown this position\r\nto be the most favorable to the full development of the force of the\r\ncharge, and to be least injurious to the piece. The size of the vent\r\nshould be as small as possible, in order to diminish the escape of the\r\ngas and the erosion of the metal which results from it. In the U. S.\r\nservice all vents are 0.2 inch in diameter. Experiment has, however,\r\nshown that the actual loss of force by the escape of the gas through the\r\nvent, as compared to that of the entire charge, is inconsiderable, and\r\nin practice may be neglected. In the U. S. service some pieces are made\r\nwith two unbushed vents which are situated in two vertical planes on\r\nopposite sides of and parallel to the axis of the bore, and at a\r\ndistance from it of one-half the radius of the bore. The left vent is\r\nbored entirely through, the other stops one inch short of the surface of\r\nthe bore. When the open vent is too much enlarged by wear for further\r\nuse, it is closed with melted zinc, and the other is bored out. Each\r\nvent is calculated to endure at least five hundred service rounds. In\r\nEnglish guns of old model, the vent is placed four-tenths of the length\r\nof the cartridge from the bottom of the bore. In most breech-loaders, as\r\nwell as many large modern muzzle-loaders, the vent is in the axis of the\r\npiece through the breech.\r\n\r\n_Seat of the Charge._--The form of the seat of the charge, or that part\r\nof the bore of a fire-arm which contains the powder, will have an effect\r\non the force of the charge and the strength of the piece to resist it.\r\nThe considerations most likely to affect the force of the powder are the\r\nform of the surface and its extent compared with the inclosed volume. To\r\nobtain the full force of the charge it is necessary that the\r\ninflammation be nearly completed before the gas begins to escape through\r\nthe windage, and the projectile is sensibly moved from its place, and as\r\nthe tension depends much upon the heat evolved by the combustion, the\r\nabsorbing surface should be a minimum compared with the volume. In\r\ncannon where the charge of powder is large, the form of the seat of the\r\ncharge is simply that of the bore prolonged; this arrangement, when\r\ncompared with the chamber, makes the absorbing surface of the metal a\r\nminimum and reduces the length of the charge, so that its inflammation\r\nwill be as complete as possible before the gas escapes and the\r\nprojectile is moved. To give additional strength to the breech, and to\r\nprevent the angle formed by the plane of the bottom and sides of the\r\nbore from becoming a receptacle for dirt and burning fragments of the\r\ncartridge-bag, it is rounded with the arc of a circle, whose radius is\r\none-fourth the diameter of the bore at this point. Instead of being a\r\nplane bottom it is sometimes made hemispherical, tangent to the surface\r\nof the bore. In all United States cannon of the most recent model, the\r\nbottom of the bore is a semi-ellipsoid; this is thought to fulfill the\r\ncondition of strength more fully than the hemisphere. With light pieces,\r\nin which it is necessary to use small charges of powder, if the charge\r\nwere made into a cartridge of a form to fit the bore its length would be\r\nless than its diameter, and being ignited at the top, a considerable\r\nportion of the gas generated in the first instance of inflammation would\r\npass through the windage, and a part of the force of the charge would be\r\nlost. To obviate this defect, to give the cartridge a more manageable\r\nform in loading, and to make the surface a minimum as regards the\r\nvolume, the diameter of this part of the bore is reduced so as to form a\r\nchamber. The shape of the chambers of fire-arms is either cylindrical,\r\nconical, or spherical; the effect of these different forms of chambers\r\non the velocity of the projectile will be modified by the size of the\r\ncharge and the length of the bore. Up to a charge of powder equal to\r\none-seventh of the weight of the projectile, and a length of bore equal\r\nto 9 or 10 calibers, experience shows that the presence of a chamber is\r\nadvantageous, but beyond these it possesses no advantages to compensate\r\nfor its inconvenience. For very small charges of powder and short\r\nlengths of bore, the cylindrical chamber gives better results than the\r\nconical chamber. For the same capacity, the conical chamber gives a\r\nshorter cartridge, and is therefore better suited to the rapid\r\ninflammation of a large charge of powder than the cylindrical chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Gomer chamber belongs to this class. (See GOMER CHAMBER.) The\r\nspherical chamber was formerly used particularly in mortars, but owing\r\nto the inconveniences which attend its construction and use, and its\r\nliability to deterioration, it is now entirely abandoned. In all the\r\nregulation guns of the U. S. land service, the bottom of the bore is a\r\nsemi-ellipsoid. The adoption of this form simplifies the whole subject\r\nof chambers, and it is found to give increased ranges for small charges.\r\nNo very careful experiments have been made to determine in a general way\r\nthe effect of chambers on the strength of cannon; but late experience\r\nindicates that cylindrical chambers in heavy iron guns have an injurious\r\neffect on their endurance, and they have consequently been abandoned in\r\nthese pieces.\r\n\r\n_The Bore_ (see BORE).--The length of the bore has an important effect\r\non the velocity of the projectile, and it was formerly supposed that the\r\nlongest pieces gave the greatest ranges; this belief was in a great\r\nmeasure due to the slow rate of burning of mealed powder, which was\r\noriginally used in cannon, but was entertained even after gunpowder\r\nreceived its granular form. When a gun is discharged, the accelerating\r\nforce is due to the expansive effort of the inflamed powder, which\r\nreaches its maximum when the grains of the charge are completely\r\nconverted into vapor and gas. This event depends on the size of the\r\ncharge, and the size and velocity of combustion of the grains. With the\r\nsame accelerating force, the point at which a projectile reaches its\r\nmaximum velocity depends on its density, or the time necessary to\r\novercome its inertia. The retarding forces are:\r\n\r\n(1) The friction of the projectile against the sides of the bore; this\r\nis the same for all velocities, but different for different metals.\r\n\r\n(2) The shocks of the projectile striking against the sides of the bore;\r\nthese will vary with the angle of incidence, which depends on the\r\nwindage and the extent of the injury due to the lodgment and balloting\r\nof the projectile.\r\n\r\n(3) The resistance offered by the column of air in front of the\r\nprojectile; this force will increase in a certain ratio to the velocity\r\nof the projectile and length of the bore. As the accelerating force of\r\nthe charge increases up to a certain point, after which it rapidly\r\ndiminishes as the space in rear of the projectile increases; and as the\r\nretarding forces are constantly opposed to its motion, it follows that\r\nthere is a point where these forces are equal, and the projectile moves\r\nwith its greatest velocity; it also follows that after the projectile\r\npasses this point its velocity decreases, until it is finally brought to\r\na state of rest, which would be the case in a gun of great length.\r\nElaborate experiments have been made in this country and abroad to\r\ndetermine accurately the influence which the length of the piece\r\nexercises on the velocity of its projectile. The experiments made by\r\nMaj. Mordecai of the U. S. Ordnance Department with a 12-pounder gun,\r\nshow that the velocity increases with the length of the bore up to 25\r\ncalibers; but that the entire gain beyond 16 calibers, or an addition of\r\nmore than one-half to the length of the gun, gives an increase of only\r\none-eighteenth to the effect of a charge of four pounds. It follows from\r\nthe foregoing that the length of bore which corresponds to a maximum\r\nvelocity depends upon the projectile, charge of powder, and material of\r\nwhich the piece is made, and taking the caliber as a unit of measure, it\r\nis found that this length is greater for small-arms which fire leaden\r\nprojectiles than for guns which fire solid iron shot, and greater for\r\nguns than for howitzers and mortars, which fire hollow projectiles. For\r\nthe same charge of powder it may be said that the initial velocity of a\r\nprojectile varies nearly with the fourth root of the length of the bore,\r\nprovided the variation in length be small.\r\n\r\n_Manufacture of Cannon._--Cannon for the U. S. service are made by\r\nprivate founders. The material and product of the casting are under the\r\nsupervision of an ordnance officer, who receives the pieces only after\r\nthey have satisfied all the conditions imposed by the regulations of the\r\nservice. There are several foundries for making cast-iron cannon.\r\nWrought-iron field cannon are principally made at the Phœnixville\r\nIron-Works, Pa. There are also several private establishments where\r\nspecial cannon are made. The several operations of manufacturing cannon\r\nare, molding, casting, cooling, and finishing.\r\n\r\n_Molding_, in general terms, is the process by which the cavity of the\r\nform of the gun is obtained by imbedding a wooden model in sand, and\r\nthen withdrawing it. The wooden model is technically called the pattern,\r\nand the sand is confined in a box, which is divided into two or more\r\nparts for convenience in withdrawing the pattern. The pattern of the\r\npiece to be cast, somewhat enlarged in its different dimensions, is\r\ncomposed of several pieces of hard wood, well seasoned, or, for greater\r\ndurability, of cast iron. The first piece of the model comprises the\r\nbody of the piece from the base-ring to the chase-ring; the swell of the\r\nmuzzle, and the sprue, or dead-head, are formed of the second piece; the\r\nbreech, of the third; and the trunnions, of the fourth and fifth pieces.\r\nThe sprue, usually called the “head,” is an additional length given to\r\nthe piece, for the purpose of receiving the scoria of the melted metal\r\nas it rises to the surface, and furnishing the extra metal needed to\r\nfeed the shrinkage. Its weight also increases the density of the lower\r\nportion of the piece. The breech is slightly lengthened in the direction\r\nof the knob of the cascabel, to form a square projection by which the\r\npiece can be held when being turned and bored. The best material for the\r\nmold is dry, hard, angular, and refractory sand, which must be moistened\r\nwith water in which strong clay has been stirred, to make it\r\nsufficiently adhesive; when not sufficiently refractory, the sand is\r\nvitrified by the high temperature of the melted metal, and\r\nprotuberances--not easily removed--are formed on the casting. When not\r\nsufficiently coarse and angular, the materials cannot be so united as to\r\npreserve the form of the molds. The mold is formed in a case of cast\r\niron, and termed the “box,” or the “flask,” consisting of several\r\npieces, each of which has flanges perforated with holes for screw-bolts\r\nand nuts, to unite the parts firmly. To form the mold, the pattern for\r\nthe sprue and muzzle, previously coated with pulverized charcoal or\r\ncoke, moistened with clay-water to prevent adhesion, is placed\r\nvertically on the ground, muzzle part up, and carefully surrounded by\r\nthe corresponding parts of the jacket. When properly adjusted, the sand,\r\nprepared as above, is rammed around it. The model for the body of the\r\npiece is then placed on the top of this, and the corresponding parts of\r\nthe jacket correctly secured, and filled in succession with the molding\r\ncomposition. The patterns for the trunnions and rimbases are bolted to\r\nthe model of the piece, and when the sand is rammed firmly around these,\r\nthe bolts are withdrawn, this part of the mold completed, and the\r\nend-plates screwed on. After completing the mold for the body of the\r\npiece, the model for the cascabel is properly adjusted and the mold\r\ncompleted. Care is taken to cover each portion of the model with the\r\ncoke-wash mentioned above, and to sprinkle dry sand upon the top of the\r\nmold in each piece of the jacket, to prevent adhesion, so that the\r\nportions of the mold may be separated. In the body of the sand, a\r\nchannel for the introduction of the metal is formed in the same manner\r\nas the mold cavity. It enters at the bottom of the mold, to prevent the\r\nbottom from being injured by the falling metal, and in an oblique\r\ndirection, to give a circular motion to the metal as it rises in the\r\nmold, and thereby prevent the scoria from adhering to the sides. When\r\nthe mold is completed, the parts of the flask are carefully taken apart,\r\nand the pieces of the model withdrawn from the mold contained in them.\r\nIf any portions of the mold be injured in withdrawing the model, they\r\nare repaired, and the interior of the mold is covered with coke-wash;\r\nafter which the several parts are placed in an oven to be gradually and\r\nperfectly dried. When this is accomplished, the parts are carried to a\r\npit, where they are united and secured in a vertical position, with the\r\nbreech below. Any portion of the sand broken off during the movements\r\nand adjustments should be replaced, and the whole of the interior\r\ncovered with coke-wash. The object of coke-wash is to prevent the sand\r\nfrom adhering to the melted metal, which, when prepared, is made to flow\r\nin at the entrance of the side-channel. As the metal rises in the mold,\r\na workman agitates it with a long pine stick, to cause the scoria and\r\nother impurities to rise to the surface, and brings them toward the\r\ncentre of the mold, to prevent their entering the cavities for the\r\ntrunnions.\r\n\r\n_Cooling._--After the mold is placed properly in the pit, it is usual to\r\nsurround the box with sand, at least as high as the trunnions of the\r\ngun. This is done to prevent rapid cooling. With guns as heavy as\r\n24-pounders, this sand is not removed for three days, and as the gun is\r\nheavier the time is prolonged, and is from seven to eight days for the\r\n10-inch columbiad. At the proper time the sand is removed, and the gun,\r\nstill imbedded in the box and sand of the mold proper, is hoisted out,\r\nthe box taken off, and when nearly cold, the gun cleaned of the sand.\r\n\r\n_Boring and Turning._--A cannon is bored by giving it a rotary motion\r\naround its axis, and causing a rod armed with a cutter to press against\r\nthe metal in the proper direction. The piece, supported in a rack, is\r\ncarefully adjusted, with its axis horizontal, and made to revolve on\r\nthis axis by machinery attached to the square knob on the cascabel.\r\nAfter adjustment, the sprue-head is first to be cut off. This is\r\neffected by placing a cutter opposite the point at which the section is\r\nto be made, and pressing it against the metal whilst the piece is\r\nturning. The head being cut off, and the cutter removed, the boring is\r\ncommenced by placing the boring-rod, armed with the first cutter, called\r\nthe piercer, in the prolongation of the axis of the piece, and pressing\r\nit against the metal. The piercer is used till it penetrates to the\r\nbottom of the chamber, after which a second cutter, or reamer, is\r\nattached to the boring-rod, and with this the boring is made complete\r\nto the round part of the chamber. The reamer is then removed and its\r\nplace supplied by the chamber-cutter, which gives the necessary form and\r\nfinish to that part of the bore. In hollow-cast cannon the piercer is\r\ndispensed with. Whilst the boring is taking place the workman contrives\r\nto finish the turning of all the exterior of the piece except the\r\nportion between the trunnions, which is afterwards planed off in another\r\nmachine. These operations having been completed, the piece is placed in\r\nthe trunnion-machine, and the trunnions are turned down to the proper\r\nsize. Care is taken to make the trunnions of the same diameter, and\r\nperfectly cylindrical. Their axes should be in the same right line,\r\nperpendicular to the axis of the piece and intersecting it.\r\n\r\n_Boring the Vent._--Whilst in the trunnion-lathe, the axis of the piece\r\nis inclined to the horizon at the angle the vent is to make with it. A\r\ndrill is placed vertically over the point where the vent is to be bored,\r\nand pressed against the metal whilst a rotary motion is given to it by\r\nhand or machinery. The time required to finish a cannon, ready for\r\ninspection, depends upon its size, or from three to four weeks for a\r\n24-pounder gun, and six weeks for an 11-inch gun.\r\n\r\n_Cast Metal Guns, Modern Improvements in._--The first great step in this\r\ndirection was taken by Gen. Rodman of the U. S. Ordnance Corps. It was\r\nhis investigation into the crystallization of cast iron which led to the\r\nabolition of sharp angles or projections in the form of cannon. His\r\nreputation, however, rests mainly upon the principle of _hollow\r\ncasting_. The general form of the old casting is that of a _solid_\r\nfrustrum of a cone; it is therefore cooled from the exterior, which\r\ncauses the thin outer layer to contract first, and forces the hotter and\r\nmore yielding metal within towards the opening of the mold. Following\r\nthis the adjacent layer cools and tends to contract, but the exterior\r\nlayer to which it coheres has become partially rigid and does not fully\r\nyield to the contraction of the inner layer. The result is, the cohesion\r\nof the particles of the inner layer is diminished by a force of\r\nextension, and that of the outer layer increased by a force of\r\ncompression. As the cooling continues this operation is repeated, until\r\nthe whole mass is brought to a uniform temperature, and the straining\r\nforce is increased to an extent which depends on the size and form of\r\nthe mass, the rapidity with which it is cooled, and the contractibility\r\nof the particular metal used. The foregoing considerations led Rodman to\r\ncast the gun hollow and to cool it from the interior, to reverse the\r\nstrains by external cooling, and make them contribute to the endurance\r\nrather than to the injury of the piece. The method employed is to carry\r\noff the internal heat by passing a stream of water through a hollow\r\ncore, inserted in the centre of the mold cavity before casting, and to\r\nsurround the flask with a mass of burning coals, to prevent too rapid\r\nradiation from the exterior. Results show that cast-iron cannon made by\r\nthis plan are not only stronger, but are less liable to enlargement of\r\nthe bore from continued firing. All large American guns of cast iron,\r\nincluding the cases for the experimental rifles, are now cast on the\r\nRodman plan. The plan has also been adopted by most of the nations of\r\nEurope that use cast-iron guns,--France, Sweden, Italy, etc.\r\n\r\nFor improvements in _bronze_, see the methods of Dean and Uchatius,\r\nORDNANCE, METALS FOR.\r\n\r\nThe following are among the best known of cast metal homogeneous guns:\r\n\r\n_Columbiad._--The columbiads are a species of sea-coast cannon\r\ncontaining certain qualities of the gun, howitzer, and mortar; they are\r\nlong, chambered pieces capable of projecting solid shot and shells with\r\nheavy charges of powder, at high angles of elevation. The columbiad was\r\ninvented by Col. Bomford, late of the U. S. service; the model was\r\nafterwards changed by lengthening the bore and increasing the weight of\r\nmetal. (See ORDNANCE, HISTORY OF.) It was afterwards discovered that\r\nthese pieces did not possess the requisite strength, and they were\r\ndegraded to the rank of shell guns, and their places supplied by pieces\r\nof improved model. The change consisted in giving greater thickness of\r\nmetal in the prolongation of the axis of the bore, which was done by\r\ndiminishing the length of the bore itself; in substituting a\r\nhemispherical bottom to the bore, and removing the cylindrical chamber;\r\nin removing the swell of the muzzle and base-ring, and in rounding off\r\nthe corner of the breech. In 1860 the model prepared by Capt. Rodman was\r\nadopted for all sea-coast cannon, and is essentially the same as the one\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\n_Paixhan Gun._--See ORDNANCE, HISTORY OF.\r\n\r\n_Dahlgren Gun._--The guns constructed after the plan of Admiral Dahlgren\r\nof the U. S. navy, are used principally in the U. S. sea service. Those\r\nof large caliber are made of cast iron, solid, and cooled from the\r\nexterior. To produce uniformity in the cooling, the piece is cast nearly\r\ncylindrical, and then turned down to the required shape. The thickness\r\nof the metal around the seat of the charge is a little more than the\r\ndiameter of the bore, as is true of nearly all the cast-iron guns. The\r\nchase, however, tapers more readily than in other cast-iron guns; they\r\nare smooth-bored, and the chamber is of the Gomer form. The principal\r\nguns of this system are of 9- and 11-inch caliber. A piece of 10-inch\r\ncaliber has, however, been introduced into the navy for firing solid\r\nshot. The 15- and 20-inch naval guns are shaped exteriorly after the\r\nDahlgren pattern, but are cast hollow, and have the elliptical chamber\r\nof the Rodman system.\r\n\r\n_Napoleon Gun._--A bronze field-piece in the U. S. service. See NAPOLEON\r\nGUN.\r\n\r\n_Rodman Gun._--The principal difficulty formerly experienced in\r\nmanufacturing very large cast-iron cannon was the injurious strain\r\nproduced by cooling the casting from the exterior. Gen. Rodman of the\r\nU. S. Ordnance Department developed a theory of the strains produced by\r\ncooling a casting like that of a cannon (see ORDNANCE, STRAINS UPON),\r\nand as a remedy for them proposed that cannon should be cast with a\r\nhollow core and cooled by a stream of water or air passing through it.\r\nThis new mode of casting was afterwards adopted by the War Department.\r\nBy this system of casting, guns of greatly-increased size and endurance\r\nare fabricated. The largest guns employed in the U. S. service (20-inch)\r\nare made on the Rodman plan, as well as the 15-inch, 13-, 10-, 8-inch,\r\netc. The external form of Rodman guns is striking, as they are much\r\nlarger at the seat of the charge than elsewhere. Their outline is made\r\nup of curved lines. This form has been almost universally adopted for\r\nU. S. guns. The Dahlgren, which preceded it, has nearly the same shape.\r\n\r\nThe great power demanded at the present day in heavy ordnance, however,\r\ncannot be attained by the use of cast iron alone. The difficulties of\r\nconstructing homogeneous guns of the stronger metals--wrought iron and\r\nsteel--have given birth in modern times to\r\n\r\n_Built-up Guns._--The term “built-up” is applied to those cannon in\r\nwhich the principal parts are formed separately, and then united\r\ntogether in a peculiar manner. One object of this mode of manufacture is\r\nto correct the defects of one material by introducing another of\r\nopposite qualities, as for instance, trials have been made to increase\r\nthe hardness, and therefore endurance, of bronze cannon by casting them\r\naround a core of steel which formed the surface of the bore. Built-up\r\ncannon are not necessarily composed of more than one kind of metal. Some\r\nof the most noted are made of steel or wrought iron alone. In this case\r\nthe defects which we have seen accompany the working of large masses of\r\nwrought iron (crystalline structure, cracks, false welds) are obviated\r\nby first forming them in small masses, as rings, tubes, etc., of good\r\nquality, and then uniting them separately. The mode of uniting a built\r\ngun may be by welding the parts, by shrinking, or forcing one over the\r\nother, or by screwing them together.\r\n\r\nIn the _construction of built-up guns_, makers have aimed at the ideal\r\ngun which has its strength proportioned to the strain it is called upon\r\nto bear in all its parts. All parts of the sides of a cannon are not\r\nstrained equally, and are therefore not brought to the breaking-point at\r\nthe same time. Any arrangement of the parts by which the explosive\r\nstrain is distributed equally over the entire thickness of the piece,\r\nnecessarily brings a greater amount of resistance into play to prevent\r\nrupture. There are two general plans for accomplishing this, viz.:\r\nFirst, by producing a strain of compression on the metal nearest the\r\nsurface of the bore. This is termed an “initial strain,” and is brought\r\nabout by shrinking heated bands or tubes around the part to be\r\ncompressed, or by slipping a tube into the bore, which has been slightly\r\nenlarged by heat. In either case it is apparent that the extent of the\r\nstrain depends on the relative size of the fitting surfaces, and the\r\namount of heat used to produce expansion. Sometimes the parts are forced\r\ntogether by hydraulic pressure after they have been carefully bored and\r\nturned to the proper size. The second plan is based on “varying\r\nelasticity,” and is accomplished by placing that metal which stretches\r\nmost within its elastic limit around the surface of the bore, so that by\r\nits enlargement the explosive strain is transmitted to the outer parts.\r\nBy the selection of suitable materials and their proper management, both\r\nof these plans may be combined in the same gun, and thereby give it\r\nincreased strength. See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\nThe best-known cannon of the _built-up_ class are:\r\n\r\n_Ames Gun._--The rifled guns made by Mr. Horatio Ames, of Falls Village,\r\nConn., are made of wrought iron on the built-up principle. The wrought\r\niron is in the form of rings, made by bending a bar around a mandrel and\r\nwelding the ends. After turning them in a lathe, two or more of these\r\nrings are fitted one within another to form a disk. These disks are\r\nwelded in succession to a concave breech-piece. Some of these guns have\r\nshown remarkable endurance. They are weakest against longitudinal\r\nstrains.\r\n\r\n_Armstrong Gun._--Is so much like the _Woolwich_, which it preceded,\r\nthat a separate description is unnecessary. See WOOLWICH GUN.\r\n\r\n_Blakely Gun._--The most approved pattern of the gun invented by Capt.\r\nBlakely combines in its construction the principles of “initial tension”\r\nand “varying elasticity,” the object of which is to bring the strength\r\nof all the metal of the piece into simultaneous play to resist\r\nexplosion. It is made of several tubes or barrels, the inner one of\r\nwhich is of low steel, having considerable but not quite enough\r\nelasticity. The next tube is made of high steel with less elasticity,\r\nand is shrunk on the barrel with just sufficient tension to compensate\r\nfor the insufficient difference of elasticity between the two tubes. The\r\nouter cast jacket, to which the trunnions are attached, is the least\r\nelastic of all, and is put on with only the shrinkage by warming it over\r\na fire. The steel tubes are cast hollow and hammered over steel mandrels\r\nunder steam-hammers; by this process they are elongated, and at the same\r\ntime the tenacity of the metal is increased, all the steel parts are\r\nannealed. Other combinations of iron and steel are used, except wrought\r\niron, which is regarded as objectionable on account of its tendency to\r\nstretch permanently. Blakely guns were rifled with one-sided grooves,\r\nand are fired with expanding projectiles. This gun is no longer made\r\nunder that name. As now made it is called the\r\n\r\n_Vavasseur Gun_, and is manufactured by Messrs. J. Vavasseur & Co. of\r\nthe London Ordnance-Works. It is made entirely of the best Sheffield\r\ncast steel, except the trunnions, which are wrought iron, and consists\r\nof an interior tube and outer tube and a number of hoops. The inner tube\r\nis forged from a solid ingot. It is rough bored and turned and then oil\r\ntempered. The outer tube and rings are cast hollow and hammered over\r\nsteel mandrels. They are heated and shrunk on. Theoretically, it is\r\ndifficult to pick a flaw in the construction of this gun. The rifling\r\nused is anomalous. It consists of three _ribs_ instead of grooves\r\nprojecting into the bore. The projectile has corresponding grooves.\r\nThese guns have found quite a market in the South American republics.\r\n\r\n_Brooke Gun._--This gun was made after the plan of Capt. Brooke for the\r\nConfederate service; it resembles Parrott’s in shape and construction,\r\nexcept that the reinforcing band is made up of iron rings not welded\r\ntogether. The rifling is similar to that used in the Blakely guns.\r\n\r\n_Fraser Gun._--See WOOLWICH GUN.\r\n\r\n_Gatling Gun._--See GATLING GUN.\r\n\r\n_Krupp Gun._--See KRUPP GUN.\r\n\r\n_Lancaster Gun._--This gun is now little used; it was made of wrought\r\niron. The bore was cut in a spiral form with an elliptical\r\ncross-section, and the projectile shaped to fit it, by which means a\r\nrotary motion was imparted.\r\n\r\n_Palliser Gun._--Maj. Palliser of the British service is the inventor of\r\na system which has been successfully applied in England to utilize\r\nsmooth-bore cast-iron guns by converting them into rifles. By his plan\r\nthe gun is first bored to a cylinder or finely tapering cone, then lined\r\nwith a tube of coiled wrought iron, the breech end of which is shrunk\r\non; the exterior of the barrel has a uniform diameter throughout. The\r\ntube is double at this part to obtain the benefit of the tension and to\r\nenable any fracture of the inner layer to be made known without bursting\r\nthe gun. The bottom of the barrel is closed by a wrought-iron cup\r\nscrewed in. The tube is inserted into the gun from the muzzle without\r\nthe application of heat. A small amount of play is allowed between the\r\nbarrel and the cast-iron body; this disappears, or is much reduced by a\r\n“setting up charge,” which expands the barrel against the cast iron. The\r\nend of the barrel is made to bear accurately against the cast-iron\r\nbreech. A collar screwed into the muzzle secures the tube in position,\r\nand prevents it from being thrust forward by the compression of the\r\nmetal by repeated firing. In front of the trunnions a pin is screwed in\r\nthrough the cast iron, to resist the tendency of the tube to be turned\r\nby the bearing of the projectile in the grooves. On the exterior of that\r\nportion of the inner tube that is covered by the second tube is cut a\r\nspiral gas channel; this communicates with a tell-tale hole drilled\r\nthrough the cast-iron breech, by which gas can escape and announce the\r\nfracture of the inner tube. The venting and rifling are similar to those\r\nemployed in the Woolwich guns. In the larger guns Maj. Palliser proposes\r\nto use two or more concentric tubes, in some the exterior one to be of\r\nsteel. This system is being applied in the United States with the most\r\npromising results in the conversion of 10-inch Rodman guns into 8-inch\r\nrifles. The rifles thus obtained, though giving to a projectile a less\r\nmuzzle velocity than does the 10-inch smooth-bore, has, on account of\r\nthe increased weight of shot, greater penetrating power at all ranges,\r\nbeing doubled at some and trebled at others. Its accuracy is three times\r\ngreater, and the capacity of its shell twice that of the original gun.\r\n\r\n_Parsons Gun._--The system upon which Mr. Parsons makes his guns is\r\nsimilar to that of Maj. Palliser. (See PALLISER GUN.) It depends upon\r\nthe principle of varying elasticities, and is based upon the fact that\r\nwrought iron may be stretched three times as much as cast iron, and will\r\noffer three and a half to six times the resistance within the limit of\r\nits elasticity. These well-known gun constructions, known as _converting\r\nsystems_, both consist in lining a cast-iron case with a wrought-iron or\r\nsteel tube. In the Palliser or English method the tube is inserted from\r\nthe muzzle. In the Parsons or American method, through the breech. In\r\nboth nearly the whole of the longitudinal strain is transferred to the\r\ncast-iron case. Both systems were first perfected in England. Col.\r\nCrispin (U. S. Ordnance Corps) deserves the credit of introducing them\r\ninto the U. S. service in constructing the new _experimental rifles_.\r\nThe Parsons system is better adapted to constructing breech-loaders.\r\n\r\n_Parrott Gun._--The Parrott rifled gun is a cast-iron piece of about the\r\nusual dimensions, strengthened by shrinking a coiled band or barrel of\r\nwrought iron over that portion of the reinforce which surrounds the\r\ncharge. The body of the larger Parrott guns are cast hollow, and cooled\r\nfrom the interior on the Rodman plan. The barrel is formed by bending a\r\nrectangular bar of wrought iron spirally around a mandrel, and then\r\nwelding the mass together by hammering it in a strong cast-iron\r\ncylinder, or tube. In bending the bar, the outer side being more\r\nelongated than the inner one, is diminished in thickness, giving the\r\ncross-section of the bar a wedge shape, which possesses the advantage of\r\nallowing the cinders to escape through the opening, thereby securing a\r\nmore perfect weld. The barrel is shrunk on by the aid of heat, and for\r\nthis purpose the reinforce of the gun is carefully turned to a\r\ncylindrical shape, and about one-sixteenth of an inch to the foot larger\r\nthan the interior diameter of the barrel in a cold state. To prevent the\r\ncast iron from expanding when the barrel is slipped on to its place, a\r\nstream of cold water is allowed to run through the bore. At the same\r\ntime, and while the band hangs loosely upon it, the body of the gun is\r\nrotated around its axis to render the cooling uniform over the whole\r\nsurface of the barrel. The proof of the Parrott guns consists in firing\r\neach piece 10 rounds with service charges.\r\n\r\n_Rodman Gun._--The principal difficulty formerly experienced in\r\nmanufacturing very large cast-iron cannon was the injurious strain\r\nproduced by cooling the casting from the exterior. Gen. Rodman of the\r\nU. S. Ordnance Department developed a theory of the strains produced by\r\ncooling a casting like that of a cannon (see ORDNANCE, STRAINS UPON),\r\nand as a remedy for them proposed that cannon should be cast on a hollow\r\ncore and cooled by a stream of water or air passing through it. This new\r\nmode of casting was afterwards adopted by the War Department. By this\r\nsystem of casting, guns of greatly increased size and endurance are\r\nfabricated. The largest guns employed in the U. S. service (20-inch) are\r\nmade on the Rodman plan, as well as many of the guns employed in the\r\nfield service.\r\n\r\n_Whitworth Gun._--These guns are made of a species of low steel; the\r\nsmaller are forged solid, the larger are built up with coils or hoops;\r\nthe hoops are forced on by hydraulic pressure, and for this purpose are\r\nmade with a slight taper and with the design to secure initial tension.\r\nThe ends of the hoops are joined by screw-threads. The hoops are first\r\ncast hollow, and then hammered out over a steel mandrel. Before\r\nreceiving their final finish they are subject to an annealing for some\r\nthree or four weeks, which makes the metal very ductile, but at the same\r\ntime slightly impairs its tenacity. The system differs from Krupp’s in\r\nthe smaller masses used and the greater number of hoops. The process for\r\nmaking the hoops is better calculated to develop their tensile strength.\r\nThe breech-pin is made with offsets in such a way as to screw into the\r\nend of the barrel and the next two surrounding hoops. The cross-section\r\nof the bore of the Whitworth gun is a hexagon with rounded corners. The\r\ntwist is very rapid and the projectiles are made very long.\r\n\r\n_Woodbridge Gun_ (invented by Dr. Woodbridge, of Little Falls, New\r\nYork).--The system of construction consists essentially of a thin steel\r\nbarrel over which wire is wound, barrel and wire being subsequently\r\nconsolidated into one mass by a brazing solder melted and poured into\r\nthe interstices. The following brief description is extracted from one\r\nof the inventor’s letters to the chief of ordnance: “Square wire is\r\nwound upon a steel core somewhat longer than the intended bore of the\r\ngun, a sufficient number of wires being wound at once side by side to\r\nproduce the required obliquity of the turns. The successive layers have\r\nopposite twists. When the mass has reached the required dimensions, it\r\nis inclosed in an air-tight case to protect it from oxidation, and is\r\nheated therein to a temperature somewhat above that required for the\r\nfusion of the soldering metal. The soldering metal having been melted is\r\nrun in, filling all the interstices of the mass. When cooled the gun is\r\nbored and finished as usual.” The invention dates back to about 1850. A\r\nsmall gun made in this way was tested by Maj. Laidley (U. S. Ordnance\r\nCorps) in 1865. It endured 1327 rounds with excessive charges, when the\r\nattempt to burst it was abandoned on account of the breaking off of the\r\ntrunnions. The only large gun ever made--a 10-inch gun--was fabricated\r\nat Frankford Arsenal. It was not entirely finished till April, 1876,\r\nsoon after which it was displayed at the Centennial Exhibition in\r\nPhiladelphia. Certain defects in its manufacture prevent it from fairly\r\nrepresenting the Woodbridge system.\r\n\r\n_Woolwich Gun._--The Woolwich or Fraser gun is in its construction a\r\nmodification of the Armstrong plan, which latter had been previously\r\nused in Great Britain; the principal difference is in substituting for a\r\nnumber of single coils and a forged breech-piece a few long double and\r\ntriple coils, and in using a cheaper quality of wrought iron. The number\r\nof pieces employed in the construction depends upon the size of the gun;\r\nan 8-inch rifled gun is composed of the inner tube (barrel) of steel,\r\nthe muzzle-coil (trousers), the breech-coil (jacket), and the\r\ncascabel-screw. The barrel is made from a solid forged cylinder of cast\r\nsteel, drawn by heating and hammering; it is turned, bored, and\r\nchambered; then heated to a uniform temperature in a vertical furnace\r\nand plunged into a covered tank of rape-oil, where it cools and soaks.\r\nThe muzzle-coil is constructed of two single coils welded together\r\nendways. Each coil is formed by heating a long bar and wrapping it about\r\na mandrel; this is next heated in a reverberatory furnace and welded\r\nunder a steam-hammer. Before being united the two cylinders are turned\r\nand bored. The breech-coil is composed of a triple coil, a\r\ntrunnion-ring, and a double coil welded together. The double coil is\r\nformed by placing a single coil, when cold, on a mandrel and winding\r\nover it, but in the reverse directions to break joints, a second bar; if\r\nover this a third bar is immediately wound in the same direction as the\r\nfirst, a triple coil will result. These coils are welded by being heated\r\nand hammered on the end and on the sides. The trunnion-ring is made by\r\nwelding slabs of iron together on the flat end of a bar, and gradually\r\nforming a ring by driving through the centre wedges and mandrels\r\nincreasing in size; the trunnions, one of which comes from the bar, are\r\nat the same time hammered into shape. The coils and the ring having been\r\nturned and bored, the latter is placed on a shoulder of the triple coil,\r\nthe double coil is dropped through the trunnion-ring on the triple coil,\r\nand the joints welded in this position. The cascabel is forged of good\r\nscrap-iron; the different parts having been formed are accurately turned\r\nand bored with a slight taper. The muzzle-coil tube being heated is\r\ndropped over the barrel, which is stood in a pit, a stream of cold water\r\ncirculating through the bore. The half-formed gun is then placed on its\r\nmuzzle, water forced through the bore, and the breech-coil heated and\r\nslipped into position. The cascabel is screwed into the breech-coil\r\nabutting against the barrel, great care being taken that the contact is\r\nperfect. A tell-tale hole is cut along the thread on the cascabel to\r\ngive warning by the escape of gas should the barrel break in firing. The\r\nvent is bored through hardened copper; it enters near the centre of the\r\nservice cartridge. This gives greater velocity, but also greater\r\npressure. The large guns have from seven to ten grooves. The twist is\r\nuniformly increasing; the shape of the grooves is circular, with curved\r\nedges.\r\n\r\n_Sutcliffe Gun._--This invention, by E. A. Sutcliffe of New York City,\r\nrelates to a breech-mechanism for cannon. See BREECH MECHANISM.\r\n\r\n_Griffin Gun._--Name sometimes given to the 3-inch rifled field-piece in\r\nthe U. S. service. It is made of wrought iron. The method of fabrication\r\nis to wrap boiler-plate around a mandrel and to weld it.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance, Metals for.= The only metals ordinarily used for cannon are\r\ncast and wrought iron, steel, and an alloy of copper and tin, or a\r\ncombination of these metals. Cannon metals should be able to resist the\r\ncorroding action of the atmosphere, the heat and the products of\r\ncombustion of the powder; should be susceptible of being easily bored\r\nand turned, and should not be too costly. The qualities necessary in\r\ncannon metals are strength to resist the explosion of the charge, weight\r\nto overcome severe recoil, and hardness to endure the bounding of the\r\nprojectile along the bore. The shape of the bore would otherwise be\r\nrapidly altered by the action of the projectile. This quality is\r\nparticularly necessary in rifled cannon. The term strength as applied to\r\ncannon metal is not confined to tensile strength alone, but embraces\r\nalso elasticity, ductility, and crystalline structure, which affect its\r\npower to resist the enormous and oft-repeated force of gunpowder. (See\r\nORDNANCE, STRAINS UPON.) Each discharge of a cannon, however small,\r\nimpairs its strength, and repeated a sufficient number of times, will\r\nburst it; this arises from the fact that the feeblest strains produce a\r\npermanent elongation or compression of iron; this is technically known\r\nas the permanent set, and the same is probably true of all other metals.\r\nThe property of ductility is of importance in enabling a metal to resist\r\nrupture after it has passed its elastic limit. The size and arrangement\r\nof the crystals of a metal have an important influence in its strength\r\nto resist a particular force. A metal will be strongest when its\r\ncrystals are small, and the principal faces parallel to the straining\r\nforce, if it be one of extension, and perpendicular to it, if it be one\r\nof compression. The size of the crystals of a particular metal depends\r\non the rate of cooling; the most rapid cooling giving the smallest\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\n_Cast iron_ is very generally employed, notably in the United States, in\r\nthe fabrication of heavy cannon for siege and sea-coast purposes. It\r\npossesses the very important qualities of tenacity, hardness, and\r\ncheapness, and with proper care is not seriously affected by rust. Its\r\nprincipal defect is an almost entire want of elasticity, in consequence\r\nof which its tenacity is destroyed after a certain number of\r\napplications of the straining force. But little is known of the causes\r\nwhich affect the quality of the cast iron used for cannon metal. The\r\namount of carbon, the state of its combination, together with the ore,\r\nfuel, and fluxes, and the process of manufacture, all materially affect\r\nthe quality of the iron. All that is known is, that certain ores treated\r\nin a certain way make cast iron suitable for cannon, and the fitness of\r\na particular kind of cast iron for artillery purposes can only be\r\ndetermined by submitting it to the tests of the service. After this is\r\nknown, a knowledge of certain physical properties, such as tenacity,\r\nhardness, density, and color, form and size of crystals presented in a\r\nfreshly fractured surface, will be useful in keeping the metal up to the\r\nrequired standard. The pig-iron from which cannon are made should be\r\nsoft, yielding easily to the file and chisel; the appearance of the\r\nfracture should be uniform, with a brilliant aspect, dark gray color,\r\nand medium-sized crystals. When remelted and cast into cannon, it should\r\nhave about sufficient hardness to resist the file and chisel, but not to\r\nbe so hard as to be bored and turned with much difficulty; its color\r\nshould be a bright gray, crystals small, structure uniform, close, and\r\ncompact. The density of gun metal should be about 7.25, and its tenacity\r\nabout 30,000. There are several varieties of cast iron differing from\r\neach other by almost insensible shades. The principal divisions are,\r\nhowever, gray and white. Gray iron is softer and less brittle than the\r\nwhite, is slightly malleable and flexible, and does not resist the file.\r\nIt has a brilliant fracture of a gray or bluish-gray color. This iron\r\nmelts at a lower temperature than white iron and becomes more fluid,\r\ncontracts less and contains fewer cavities; it fills the mold well, the\r\nedges of a casting are short, and the surface smooth, convex, and\r\ncovered with carburet of iron. Gray iron is the only kind suitable for\r\nmaking castings which require great strength, such as cannon. White iron\r\nis very brittle, resists the file and chisel, and is susceptible of high\r\npolish, the surface of a casting is concave, the fracture presents a\r\nsilvery appearance. Its qualities are the reverse of those of gray iron;\r\nit is therefore unsuitable for ordnance purposes. Mottled iron is a\r\nmixture of white and gray; it has a spotted appearance, and flows well.\r\nThe casting has a plane surface with edges slightly rounded. It is\r\nsuitable for making shot and shells. Besides these general divisions,\r\nthere are several other varieties of iron whose qualities depend upon\r\nthe proportion of carbon, and the state in which it is found in the\r\nmetal. The color and texture of cast iron depend greatly on the size of\r\nthe casting and the rapidity of cooling. See ORDNANCE, STRAINS UPON.\r\n\r\n_Wrought iron_ was among the earliest metals employed in the\r\nconstruction of cannon, but in consequence of the defects which almost\r\ninvariably accompany the forging of large masses, it was superseded by\r\nbronze and cast iron to a great extent. Wrought iron is softer than cast\r\niron, and, being pure iron, is more liable to be corroded by the action\r\nof the atmosphere and products of combustion of the powder; it possesses\r\nalso considerable ductility. The tensile strength of wrought iron, which\r\nunder the most favorable circumstances is double that of the best cast\r\niron, depends on the character of the crystalline structure, and the\r\nmanner of applying the tensile force, or in other words, wrought iron\r\noffers the greatest resistance to a force of extension when the\r\nstructure is fibrous, and the force acts in the direction of the fibres.\r\nThe practical difficulties of rapidly cooling large masses so as to form\r\nsmall crystals, and compressing them by hammering, rolling, or otherwise\r\nto develop and give a particular direction to the fibre, have not thus\r\nfar been wholly surmounted. On the contrary, large masses are generally\r\nfound to contain such internal defects as false welds, cracks, and a\r\nspongy and irregularly crystalline structure, arising from the more\r\nrapid cooling of the exterior surface.\r\n\r\n_Steel_ is a compound of iron and carbon, in which the proportion of the\r\nlatter seldom exceeds 1.7 per cent. It may be distinguished from iron by\r\nits fine grain, its susceptibility of hardening by immersing it when hot\r\nin cold water, and with certainty by the action of diluted nitric acid,\r\nwhich leaves a black spot on steel, and on iron a spot which is lighter\r\ncolored in proportion as the iron contains less carbon. For the\r\nconstruction of cannon, steel may be divided into high and low steel,\r\nthe difference being that the former contains more carbon than the\r\nlatter. High steel is very hard and has great ultimate tenacity. It has\r\nbut little extensibility within or without the elastic limit, and is\r\ntherefore too brittle for use in cannon, unless used in such large\r\nmasses that the elastic limit will not be exceeded by the explosive\r\nforce of the powder. It melts at a lower temperature than wrought iron\r\nand is difficult to weld, as its welding temperature is but little less\r\nthan that at which it melts. Low steel is often known as “mild steel,”\r\n“soft steel,” “homogeneous metal,” and “homogeneous iron,” and is made\r\nby fusing wrought iron with carbon in a crucible; after which it is\r\ncast into an ingot and worked under a hammer. As it contains less carbon\r\nthan high steel, it has greater specific gravity. It can be welded\r\nwithout difficulty, although overheating injures it. It more nearly\r\nresembles wrought iron in all its properties, although it has much\r\ngreater hardness and ultimate tenacity, and a lower range of ductility\r\ndepending on its proportion of carbon. It has less extensibility within\r\nthe elastic limit than high steel, but greater beyond it, or in other\r\nwords, greater ductility. Its great advantage over wrought iron for\r\ngeneral purposes is that it can be melted at a practicable heat, and run\r\ninto large masses possessing soundness and tenacity. Its advantages for\r\ncannon are greater elasticity, tenacity, and hardness. Its tenacity when\r\nsuitable for cannon is three times as much as cast gun iron, and\r\none-half more than the best wrought iron. The principal varieties of\r\nsteel are:\r\n\r\n_Natural Steel._--This is made principally in Germany, and is used for\r\nmaking files and other tools. It is obtained by reducing the rich and\r\npure kinds of iron ore with charcoal, and re-fusing the cast iron so as\r\nto bring it to a malleable state. The India steel, or Wootz, is a\r\nnatural steel containing a small proportion of other metals.\r\n\r\n_Blistered Steel._--This is prepared by exposing alternate layers of\r\nbar-iron and charcoal in a close furnace for several days. When taken\r\nout the bars are brittle in quality and crystalline in appearance. The\r\npurpose for which the steel is to be used determines the degree of\r\ncarbonization. The best qualities of iron (Russian and Swedish) are used\r\nfor the finest kind of steel.\r\n\r\n_Tilted Steel._--This is blistered steel moderately heated and subjected\r\nto the action of a tilt-hammer, by which means its density and tenacity\r\nare increased.\r\n\r\n_Shear Steel._--A blistered or natural steel refined by piling thin bars\r\ninto fagots, and then rolling or hammering them into bars, after they\r\nhave been brought to a welding heat in a reverberatory furnace. The\r\nquality is improved by a repetition of this process, and the steel is\r\nknown accordingly by the names, half shear, single shear, double shear,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_Cast Steel._--This is made by breaking blistered steel into small\r\npieces, and melting it in close crucibles from which it is poured into\r\niron molds. The ingot is then reduced to a bar by hammering or rolling\r\nwith great care. Cast steel is the finest kind of steel, and is best\r\nadapted for most purposes; it is known by a very fine, even, and close\r\ngrain, and a silvery homogeneous fracture. The most remarkable specimen\r\nof cast steel for tenacity which is on record was manufactured at\r\nPittsburgh, Pa. It was tested at the Washington Navy-Yard, and found to\r\nsustain 242,000 pounds to the square inch. The strength of cast steel\r\nusually runs from 70 to 140,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n_Bessemer Steel._--This steel is produced by forcing air into melted\r\niron, by means of which the carbon and silicon of the crude cast iron is\r\noxidized. The essential difference between this process and the ordinary\r\npuddling is mechanical, and consists in the intense and violent stirring\r\nof the Bessemerized iron, to which alone is due the production and\r\nmaintenance of a temperature, without any other fuel than the carbon and\r\nsilicon contained, that keeps the metal fluid so that it can be cast\r\ninto homogeneous malleable ingots. When decarburation has been carried\r\nfar enough, the current of air is stopped, and a small quantity of white\r\npig-iron containing a large amount of manganese is dropped into the\r\nliquid metal. No very large cannon have yet been made wholly of Bessemer\r\nsteel, but several small ones have, which have shown great endurance.\r\nExperiments at the Woolwich Arsenal have shown that the tenacity of this\r\nsteel is more than doubled by hammering.\r\n\r\n_Siemens-Martin._--In this process the ingredients of cast steel are\r\nmelted together on the open hearth of a reverberatory furnace of special\r\nconstruction, and a certain proportion of manganese necessary to make a\r\nsound and practically malleable steel added. This steel is, however,\r\nlittle used in gun construction.\r\n\r\n_Semi-Steel._--If in the process of puddling or decarbonizing cast iron\r\nthe process be stopped at a particular time, determined by indications\r\ngiven by the metal to an experienced eye, an iron is obtained of greater\r\nhardness and strength than ordinary iron, to which the name of\r\nsemi-steel, or puddled steel, has been given. The principal difficulty\r\nin its manufacture is that of obtaining uniformity in the product,\r\nhomogeneity and solidity throughout the entire mass. It is much improved\r\nby reheating and hammering under a heavy hammer; but it has not been\r\nfound a reliable material for even cannon of small caliber. The\r\ncelebrated guns made by Mr. Krupp of Germany are of cast steel, made\r\nfrom puddled steel, and of peculiar character, combining great tensile\r\nstrength with the property of stretching to a great extent without\r\nbreaking. Sir Joseph Whitworth improves the qualities of steel for his\r\nmore recent guns by casting it under hydraulic pressure.\r\n\r\n_Chrome Steel._--An alloy of iron and chromium, which is not steel in\r\nthe ordinary sense, but which possesses many of its characteristics. The\r\ntensile strength and resistance to crushing is much higher than ordinary\r\ncast steel. This material has been largely used in bridge-building, but\r\nhas not yet been applied to cannon-making.\r\n\r\n_Bronze_ for cannon (commonly called brass) consists of 90 parts of\r\ncopper and 10 of tin, allowing a variation of one part of tin more or\r\nless; by increasing the proportion of tin, bronze becomes harder, but\r\nmore brittle and fusible; by diminishing it it becomes too soft for\r\ncannon, and at the same time loses a part of its elasticity. Bronze is\r\nmore fusible than copper, much less so than tin. It is harder, less\r\nsusceptible of oxidation, and much less ductile than either of its\r\nconstituents. Its fracture is of a yellowish color, with little lustre,\r\na coarse grain, irregular, and often exhibiting spots of tin which are\r\nof a whitish color. The density and tenacity of bronze when cast into\r\nthe form of cannon, are found to depend upon the pressure and mode of\r\ncooling. In consequence of the difference of fusibility of tin and\r\ncopper, the perfection of the alloy depends much on the nature of the\r\nfurnace and the treatment of the melted metal. By these means alone the\r\ntenacity of bronze has been carried up to 60,000 pounds. Bronze is but\r\nslightly corroded by the action of the gases evolved from gunpowder, or\r\nby atmospheric causes; but its tin is liable to be melted away at the\r\nsharp corners by the great heat generated in rapid firing. It is soft,\r\nand therefore liable to serious injury by the bounding of the projectile\r\nin the bore. This injury is augmented as the force of the rebound is\r\nincreased by the elasticity of the metal. It was established by\r\nexperiments of Maj. Wade of the U. S. Ordnance Corps more than twenty\r\nyears ago that the tensile strength of bronze is related to its density.\r\nIt has been discovered since that this density can be produced by\r\nartificial compression. Two men claim the honors of the invention--Gen.\r\nUchatius of the Austrian army, and S. B. Dean, an American inventor. The\r\nmethods are essentially the same. After the gun is cast, steel mandrels\r\nslightly conical in shape are driven through the bore by hydraulic\r\npressure,--each being succeeded by one slightly larger,--thus enlarging\r\nthe bore and compressing the metal surrounding it. It is claimed that\r\nthe bronze is thus rendered harder and stronger, and the defects above\r\ncited in a large measure obviated. The term “steel bronze” or “bronze\r\nsteel” has been applied to the metal so treated. Many guns have been\r\nmade of it for the Austrian service,--the largest of which is a 6-inch\r\nbreech-loader throwing a projectile of 85 pounds. This gun has proved\r\nitself slightly superior in power to the same sized Krupp gun of steel.\r\n\r\n_Aluminium Bronze._--An alloy of 90 parts of copper and 10 of aluminium.\r\nIt is harder than ordinary bronze; much stronger, being 100,000 pounds\r\nto the square inch; it does not tarnish readily. Its properties would\r\nseem to especially fit it for a gun metal. _Phosphor bronze_ is an alloy\r\nwith very similar properties.\r\n\r\n_Combined Metals._--Numerous trials have been made to improve the\r\nstrength of cannon by combining two or more metals in such a way that\r\nthe good qualities of one will counteract the defects of the others. But\r\nthe only metals used to any extent are those described above. Steel is\r\nconstantly gaining in favor as a cannon metal. It is now almost\r\nexclusively employed throughout Europe, and wherever the Krupp gun is\r\nused. The great perfection arrived at by Krupp and others in the\r\nmanufacture of steel seems to place that metal above all others for gun\r\nconstruction, whilst the difficulty of handling large masses has been\r\novercome by the enormous power of the machinery used. Steel is also\r\nsparingly employed both in the United States and England for converting\r\nsmooth-bore guns into rifles according to the Palliser method, but\r\nexperiments in the United States have shown that it is inferior to\r\nwrought iron for this purpose. See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\nWrought and cast iron are much used in this way for cannon in both the\r\nUnited States and in England. In the former, all the larger cannon\r\nbelonging to the official system (both siege and sea-coast) are made of\r\nthe cast metal, whereas the Parrott gun and the new rifled pieces are a\r\ncombination of both. (See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.) The metal chiefly\r\nemployed in England is wrought iron, in combination with steel; the\r\nlargest guns made at the Woolwich Arsenal are of this nature. Bronze,\r\nexcept as modified by the Austrians, has now nearly entirely gone out of\r\nuse as a cannon metal. In France and the United States, field-pieces,\r\nmortars, and howitzers are still made of this material.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance, Strains Upon.= The exterior form of cannon is determined by\r\nthe variable thickness of the metal which surrounds the bore at\r\ndifferent points of its length. In general terms, the thickness is\r\ngreatest at the seat of the charge, and least at or near the muzzle.\r\nThis arrangement is made on account of the variable action of the powder\r\nand projectile along the bore, and the necessity of disposing the metal\r\nin the safest and most economical manner. The pressure at different\r\npoints may be approximately determined by calculation, or, more\r\naccurately, by experiment. In the latter method, the plan generally\r\nemployed consists in boring a series of small holes through the side of\r\na gun at right angles to its axis at known distances apart. A steel ball\r\nis projected from each hole in succession into a target, or ballistic\r\npendulum, by the force of the charge acting through it, and the pressure\r\nat the various points is deduced from the velocities communicated to\r\nthese balls. This method was adopted by Col. Bomford. Instead of the\r\nprojectile a steel punch may be employed, which is pressed by the force\r\nof the charge into a piece of soft copper. (See PRESSURE-GAUGE.) The\r\nweight necessary to make an equal indentation in the same piece is then\r\nascertained by a testing machine. The strains to which all fire-arms are\r\nsubjected may be classified as follows: (1) The tangential strain which\r\ntends to split the piece open longitudinally, and is similar in its\r\naction to the force which bursts the hoops of a barrel. (2) The\r\nlongitudinal strain which acts to pull the piece apart in the direction\r\nof its length. Its action is greatest at or near the bottom of the\r\nbore, and least at the muzzle, where it is nothing; these two strains\r\nincrease the volume of the metal to which they are applied. (3) A strain\r\nof compression which acts from the axis outward to crush the truncated\r\nwedges of which a unit of length of the piece may be supposed to\r\nconsist; this strain compresses the metal and enlarges the bore. (4) A\r\ntransverse strain which acts to break transversely by bending outward\r\nthe staves of which the piece may be supposed to consist. This strain\r\ncompresses the metal on the inner and extends it on the outer surface.\r\nIt is known that rupture will take place due to the tangential strain\r\nalone, when three times the pressure upon a unit of surface of the bore\r\nis greater than twice the tensile strength. Due to the longitudinal\r\nstrain alone, rupture will take place in the direction of the length,\r\nwhen the pressure is greater than twice the tensile strength; and if the\r\ntransverse strain alone is considered, rupture will take place when\r\ntwice the pressure is greater than three times the tensile strength. It\r\ntherefore appears that the tendency to rupture is greater from the\r\naction of the tangential force than from any other, and for lengths\r\nabove two, or perhaps three calibers, the tangential resistance may be\r\nsaid to act alone, as the aid derived from the transverse resistance\r\nwill be but trifling for greater lengths of bore; but for lengths of\r\nbore less than two calibers, this resistance will be aided by both the\r\ntransverse and the longitudinal resistance. Every piece should therefore\r\nhave sufficient thickness of breech to prevent splitting through the\r\nlatter; after this point has been attained, any additional thickness of\r\nbreech adds nothing to the strength of the piece. It therefore appears\r\nthat a fire-arm is strongest at or near the bottom of the bore, and that\r\nits strength is diminished rapidly as the length of the bore increases\r\nto a certain point (probably not more than three calibers from the\r\nbottom); after which, for equal thickness of metal, its strength becomes\r\nsensibly uniform. The metals of which cannon are made being crystalline\r\nin structure, the size and arrangement of the crystals have an important\r\ninfluence on its strength to resist a particular force; and a metal will\r\nhave the greatest strength with reference to a particular force when its\r\ncrystals are small, and the principal faces are parallel to the\r\nstraining force, if it be one of extension, and perpendicular to it, if\r\nit be one of compression. The position of the principal crystalline\r\nfaces of a cooling solid is found to be perpendicular to the cooling\r\nsurface; the result of this arrangement of crystals is to create planes\r\nof weakness where the different systems of crystals intersect. The\r\neffect of this law upon cannons, it has been discovered, is to render\r\nradial specimens more tenacious than those cut tangentially from the\r\nsame gun. The manner and rapidity of cooling have also a great effect\r\nupon the ability of cannon to resist strains, and as all solid bodies\r\ncontract their size in the operation of cooling, it follows that if the\r\ndifferent parts of a cannon cool unequally, it will change its form,\r\nprovided it be not restrained by the presence of a superior force. If it\r\nbe so restrained, the contractile force will diminish the adhesion of\r\nthe parts by an amount which depends on the rate of cooling of the\r\ndifferent parts, and the contractibility of the metal. This is an\r\nimportant consideration in estimating the strength and endurance of\r\ncannon, particularly those made of cast iron. All such cannon cooled\r\nfrom the exterior (see ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF) are affected by two\r\nstraining forces; the outer portion of the metal being compressed, and\r\nthe interior extended, in proportion to their distances from the neutral\r\naxis or line composed of particles which are neither extended nor\r\ncompressed by the cooling process. The effect of this unequal\r\ncontraction may be so great as to crack the interior metal of cast iron\r\neven before it has been subjected to the force of gunpowder. The strain\r\nproduced by the explosion of gunpowder is not distributed equally over\r\nthe thickness of metal, but it varies inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance from the centre; it therefore follows that the sides of a\r\ncannon are not rent asunder as by a simple tensile force, but they are\r\ntorn apart like a piece of cloth, commencing at the surface of the bore.\r\nHence it is that the effect of ordinary cooling is to diminish the\r\nstrength and hardness of the metal of cannon at or near a point where\r\nthe greatest strength and hardness are required, _i.e._, at the surface\r\nof the bore. The strains produced by unequal cooling increase with the\r\ndiameter of the casting and the irregularity of its form. This explains\r\nthe great difficulty found in making large cast-iron cannon\r\nproportionally as strong as small ones, and also how projections like\r\nbands, moldings, etc., injure the strength of cannon. It also explains\r\nwhy cannon made of “light” cast iron, or cast iron made more tenacious\r\nby partial decarbonization, are not so strong as cannon made of weaker\r\niron; for it is well known that such iron contracts more than the latter\r\nin cooling, and therefore produces a greater strain of extension on the\r\nsurface of the bore. Capt. Rodman of the U. S. Ordnance Department has\r\nproposed a plan for cooling cannon from the interior (see ORDNANCE,\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF), thereby reversing the strains produced by external\r\ncooling, and making them contribute to the endurance rather than to the\r\ninjury of the piece. It is likely, however, that the strains produced by\r\nunequal cooling are modified by time, which probably allows the\r\nparticles to accommodate themselves to a certain extent to their\r\nconstrained position. In confirmation of this, great endurance has been\r\nfrequently found in _old_ solid cast guns, as in the old 42-pounders\r\ntested about the beginning of the war, 1861-65.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance Department.= In the United States, was first established May\r\n14, 1812, and was not provided for in the reduction of the army in 1815,\r\nbut continued in the service. In 1821 the department was merged into the\r\nartillery, attaching to each regiment of artillery 1 supernumerary\r\ncaptain, and giving to each company 4 subaltern officers. The corps of\r\nordnance was re-established April 5, 1832. The department consists of 1\r\nbrigadier-general, 3 colonels, 4 lieutenant-colonels, 10 majors, 20\r\ncaptains, 16 first lieutenants, and 350 enlisted men. It is the duty of\r\nthe senior officer of the ordnance department to direct the inspection\r\nand proving of all pieces of ordnance, shot, shells, small-arms, and\r\nequipments procured for the use of the armies of the United States; and\r\nto direct the construction of all cannon and carriages, and every\r\nimplement and apparatus for ordnance, and all ammunition-wagons,\r\ntraveling-forges, and artificers’ wagons; the inspection and proving of\r\npowder, and the preparation of all kinds of ammunition and ordnance\r\nstores. It is also the duty of the senior officer of the ordnance\r\ndepartment to furnish estimates, and, under the direction of the\r\nSecretary of War, to make contracts and purchases for procuring the\r\nnecessary supplies of arms, ordnance, and ordnance stores, etc. In the\r\nBritish service, the ordnance department was a distinct branch of the\r\nwar department, originally for the supply of all warlike stores used in\r\nthe naval or military service. The first master of ordnance was created\r\nin the time of Henry VIII., and the Tower of London was probably the\r\ndepot of arms and military stores; Robert, earl of Essex, is said to\r\nhave been the first master-general, in 1596. It does not appear that the\r\nordnance department of the British service became especially military\r\nuntil the early part of the 18th century, after the organization of the\r\nRoyal Artillery, in 1743, under the Duke of Montague as master-general.\r\nFrom this time the ordnance department was administered by a\r\nmaster-general and board, the latter being composed of a\r\nlieutenant-general of ordnance, surveyor-general, clerk of the ordnance,\r\nprincipal store-keeper, clerk of the deliveries, and treasurer. About\r\n1763 the department became a construction board, with charge of all\r\nforts and fortresses, and directed the construction of all the\r\nfortifications and military store-houses, and barracks for the ordnance\r\ncorps. The board was finally abolished as a separate department, the\r\nduties carried on by the commander-in-chief, and the various civil\r\nbranches by separate offices under the secretary of state for war.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance Office.= Before the invention of guns, this office was\r\nsupplied by officers under the following names: the bowyer, the\r\ncross-bowyer, the galeater, or purveyor of helmets, the armorer, and the\r\nkeeper of the tents. Henry VIII. placed under the management of a\r\nmaster-general, a lieutenant, surveyor, etc. The master-general was\r\nchosen from among the first generals in the service of the sovereign.\r\nThe appointment was formerly for life; but since the restoration, was\r\nheld _durante bene placito_, and not unfrequently by a cabinet minister.\r\nThe letters patent for this office were revoked May 25, 1855, and its\r\nduties vested in the minister of war. The last master-general was Lord\r\nFitzroy Somerset, afterwards Lord Raglan.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance Sergeants.= In the U. S. service, are staff sergeants who are\r\nselected from the sergeants of the line of the army. Their duties\r\nconsist in receiving and preserving the ordnance, arms, ammunition, and\r\nother ordnance stores at posts, under the direction of the commanding\r\nofficer of the same. They must not be confounded with sergeants of\r\nordnance, who are sergeants in the ordnance detachments at arsenals,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance Store-keeper.= In the British service, is a civil officer in\r\nthe artillery who has charge of all the stores, for which he is\r\naccountable to the office of ordnance.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance Store-keeper.= In the U. S. army, an officer of the ordnance\r\ndepartment who holds the rank of captain. The grade has been abolished\r\nby act of Congress, and the duties appertaining to the office will be\r\nperformed by other officers of the ordnance department.\r\n\r\n=Ordnance Stores.= See ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n=Oregon.= One of the Pacific States of the American Confederacy. Oregon\r\nwas the name formerly given to the whole territory north of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and was first claimed by the Spanish government, and next by\r\nthe government of the United States, as far as lat. 54° 40′ N. This\r\nlatter claim was resisted by the British government, which asserted a\r\nright to the entire territory, and in 1818 a treaty was made, and\r\nrenewed in 1827, giving joint occupation to the disputed territory. In\r\n1846 a treaty was concluded, by which the boundary was settled on the\r\n49th parallel. Previous to this latter treaty (1839) emigration from the\r\nUnited States, for the purpose of settlement, commenced, and it\r\ncontinued steadily until the opening of the gold mines in California,\r\nwhich attracted a great many emigrants. In 1849 it formed a Territorial\r\ngovernment, and in 1859 it was admitted into the Union as a State. This\r\nState has been troubled greatly by Indians, and has been the scene of\r\nseveral wars in earlier days, notably, in 1853, on Rogue River; in 1855,\r\nwhen a general outbreak took place, of which the following is a brief\r\nsummary: In 1855 a war broke out between the whites and the Indians of\r\nWashington Territory. The head and front of the outbreak on the part of\r\nthe Indians was Kam-ai-a-kin. He took this stand from a fixed principle:\r\nthat of resisting all encroachments on the part of the whites. He had\r\nseen the fate of the Indian race in the Willamette Valley, and he\r\ndetermined to anticipate such a result with regard to his own people,\r\nand, if possible, to prevent it. When Gov. Stevens made his arbitrary\r\ntreaties with him, and left him no discretion but to sell his land; and\r\nwhen the miners began to traverse his country, he concluded that the\r\nhour had arrived to fight, and he called to his aid as many of the\r\nadjoining tribes as he could persuade into it. The manner in which the\r\ntreaties on Puget Sound were conducted created great dissatisfaction\r\namong the Indians, and they were quite ready to join Kam-ai-a-kin. The\r\nwar commenced by the killing of miners, who were picked off in the\r\nYakama country as they were going to Fort Colville, scarcely a month\r\nafter the council which was held at Walla Walla. The killing of the\r\nagent Bolen set the war in a blaze. The small detachment of troops sent\r\nto chastise them was driven back. This success on the part of the\r\nKlickatats encouraged the Sound Indians, who also took up arms, and in\r\nthe absence of troops, fell upon and killed the inhabitants of White\r\nRiver; but the wholesale slaughter of women and children by a party\r\nunder the command of Major Lupton on October 8, 1855, drove the Indians\r\nto desperation and caused them to commence the war in earnest;\r\nhostilities continued until the summer of 1856. Also, in later years,\r\nthe Modoc war (1872), the Nez Pérces (1877), and the Bannock war (1878).\r\n\r\n=Oreillere= (_Fr._). Oreillet, ear-piece of an ancient helmet, shaped\r\nlike an oyster-shell, for protecting the ear and cheek.\r\n\r\n=Oreillon= (_Fr._). Ear of a sword, languet, or small slip of metal on\r\nthe hilt, which, when the sword is sheathed, extends along the scabbard.\r\n\r\n=Organization.= The act of assigning and putting troops into such\r\nuniform state of discipline as may fit them to co-operate on any\r\nservice. _Organization_ may be said to be begun by grouping those\r\ncombatants who have the same mode of action. These groups are known as\r\n“arms of service.” An arm of service may be defined to be “a union of\r\ncombatants having the same mode of action.” There are four of these arms\r\nin modern armies, viz.: _Infantry_, _Cavalry_, _Artillery_, and\r\n_Engineers_. These four arms form the principal part of a mobilized\r\narmy, and as they or their representatives are always formed into a line\r\nof battle to resist the attack of an enemy, or to make an attack, they\r\nare generally known as the “line of the army” or “troops of the line,”\r\nto distinguish them from other bodies of men who form parts of an army.\r\nThese _arms_ are subdivided into fractions for the purpose of\r\ninstruction and of supply. The unit for instruction and the unit for\r\nsupply may be the same or different. The unit of supply, as a general\r\nrule, is constant, and is also usually the unit of instruction in\r\ndiscipline. The unit of instruction in tactics will depend upon\r\ncircumstances, and upon the kind of movements the commander desires to\r\nmake. The common unit for the four arms, for supplying the men’s wants\r\nand for instruction in discipline, is the “company.” This unit receives,\r\nat other times, other names, depending upon circumstances. For instance,\r\na _battery_ of artillery is the same as company; the term _squadron_ of\r\ncavalry frequently means a company, etc.\r\n\r\n_A company_ consists of a given number of men commanded by a\r\ncommissioned officer who has the rank of captain. Two, sometimes three,\r\nand even more commissioned officers of a grade below that of captain are\r\nappointed to assist the captain in the discharge of his duties. These\r\nofficers have the grade of lieutenant. Their number and the number of\r\nmen forming a company are fixed by law. A certain number are selected\r\nfrom the men and appointed non-commissioned officers, with the rank of\r\nsergeant or of corporal. These non-commissioned officers are used to\r\ninstruct the men in their military duties and in discipline. The whole\r\ncompany should be divided into _squads_ of equal numbers, and each squad\r\nplaced under the charge of a non-commissioned officer, who should be\r\nheld responsible for the cleanliness of the men of his squad, not only\r\nas to their persons, clothing, and arms, but as to their tents or\r\nquarters. The _company_, with its size based on the theory that it must\r\nnot be larger than one man on foot can thoroughly command in person, is\r\nthe unit of organization. Two or three or more companies form a\r\n_battalion_. Four, and at the outside, five companies placed in line\r\nform, in these times, so extended a line that a single person in\r\nimmediate and personal command of them will find difficulty in making\r\nhimself heard and understood throughout the entire line. For this reason\r\nthe battalion should not, as a rule, contain more than four companies.\r\n\r\n_The battalion_ is the _tactical_ unit, both for instruction in tactics\r\nand in the execution of its movements. The battalion is sometimes made a\r\nunit of administration, and forms a complete organization under the\r\ncommand of a commissioned officer of the grade of major or\r\nlieutenant-colonel. The more usual rule is to increase the number of\r\ncompanies so as to have enough to form at least two battalions, and with\r\nthese companies to form the organization known as a _regiment_.\r\n\r\n_The regiment_ is always an _administrative_ unit, and is commanded by a\r\ncommissioned officer who has the grade of _colonel_. The colonel is\r\ncharged with the proper administration of the supplies for the regiment,\r\nand with preserving good order and promoting discipline. He takes every\r\nopportunity to instruct both the officers and men in the principles and\r\ndetails of all movements that ought in any case to be made by a\r\nbattalion. Upon the organization of a regiment, the company officers are\r\nassigned to companies, and each company is designated by a letter of the\r\nalphabet. Upon the recommendation of the captains, the colonel appoints\r\nthe non-commissioned officers of the companies. He appoints an adjutant\r\nfrom the lieutenants of the regiment, and a non-commissioned staff from\r\nthe enlisted men, to assist him in his duties. He selects from the\r\nlieutenants a quartermaster, whose appointment is confirmed by the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe elements of organization for the other three arms of service are\r\npractically the same, being that of a company or similar body of men\r\nunder the command of a captain, and these units grouped together into a\r\nbattalion or regimental organization for administrative purposes. This\r\nsubdivision into companies and into regiments is most essential for\r\ninstruction in discipline.\r\n\r\n_Discipline_ is an indispensable condition for the existence of a good\r\narmy. It imparts _cohesion_ and _flexibility_ to the armed mass. Without\r\ndiscipline an army is only an armed mob over which a commander would\r\nhave no control, and upon which he could not rely in the execution of\r\nhis plans. When the army is to be mobilized the regiments are brought\r\ntogether and organized into _brigades_ and _divisions_. Two or more\r\nregiments form a brigade; two or more brigades form a division. A\r\ngeneral officer of the grade of _brigadier-general_ is assigned to the\r\ncommand of a brigade, and one of the grade of _major-general_ to the\r\ncommand of a division. These divisions and brigades may be composed\r\nentirely of one arm, or they may be composed of troops belonging to all\r\nfour of the arms.\r\n\r\n_The division_ is the unit of organization and administration of a\r\nmobilized army, and is also the _tactical_ unit of the general in\r\ncommand. When the army is very large, three or four divisions are joined\r\ntogether and form an _army corps_. The officer commanding an army corps\r\nshould be of a higher grade than he who commands a division. This grade\r\nin the U. S. army would be that of _lieutenant-general_.\r\n\r\n_An army corps_ is most generally composed of all arms of service, and\r\nis, to all intents and purposes, an army complete in itself. Two or more\r\narmy corps or armies would be under the command of the _general_, or of\r\na “general-in-chief.” There has arisen an organization forming an\r\nessential part of every army, known as the _general staff_, and divided\r\ninto corps and departments to which are assigned special duties. In some\r\ncases, the term “general staff” is limited to include only those\r\nofficers who are used by the general to communicate his orders, and to\r\ninform him of the general and particular conditions of the troops; and\r\nthe term “staff department” or “supply department” is used to include\r\nthose officers whose duties are confined to distinct branches of service\r\nhaving for their object the supply of troops. If the army is one of very\r\ngreat size, the general ordinarily attaches to his headquarters a\r\nrepresentative of the three arms of artillery, cavalry, and engineers,\r\ngiving them the position of staff-officers with the name of “chief of\r\nartillery,” “chief of cavalry,” etc. They are required to keep the\r\ngeneral informed of the state of supplies, and whatever concerns their\r\nparticular arm, in a similar manner to that required by the other\r\nofficers of the staff. The general also appoints from the subordinate\r\nofficers belonging to his command a certain number of _aides-de-camp_.\r\nThese officers are _ex officio_ adjutants-general, and receive orders\r\nfrom the general himself. They are confidential officers, who are\r\nsupposed to be used only in delicate and difficult duties, where they\r\nmay in a degree represent the general. Hence, they are intrusted to\r\ndeliver verbal orders which cannot be intrusted with propriety to\r\nenlisted men or to the ordinary means of communication.\r\n\r\n_Proportion of Arms of Service._--The mass of a modern army is composed\r\nof infantry. The amount of cavalry will depend upon the topographical\r\nfeatures of the country, being in some cases as much as one-fourth of\r\nthe infantry, and in others as little as one-tenth. The amount of light\r\nartillery depends upon the character of the country. There should be at\r\nleast two guns to every thousand men. The quantity of heavy artillery,\r\nor number of siege-batteries, which enter the composition of an army,\r\nwill depend to a great extent upon the plan of campaign and the probable\r\nuse for which they may be intended. The circumstances of the case in\r\neach campaign will therefore decide as to the proportion to be employed.\r\nThe number of engineer troops will depend both on the nature of the\r\ncountry and on the probable amount of work which will be required from\r\nthis class of troops. Each division should contain at least one company\r\nof engineer troops. It is usual, if there be none, to detail one or more\r\ncompanies of infantry to act as engineer soldiers; they are designated\r\nas “pioneers.” These engineer troops, or troops acting in that capacity,\r\nmarching in the advance, make the roads practicable for the command by\r\nrepairing them, removing obstructions, etc. At the crossing of streams,\r\nwhere bridges are to be made, or where existing bridges are to be\r\nrepaired to an extent requiring more knowledge of bridge construction\r\nthan that usually possessed by the pioneer, another detachment of troops\r\nbelonging to the engineer arm is brought forward to do the work. These\r\ntroops are known as _pontoniers_, and have special charge of bridge\r\nconstruction for the army. They may be divided into two parts: one to\r\nhave charge of construction of temporary bridges, especially of floating\r\nand trestle bridges, and construction of ferries; the other to have\r\ncharge of repairs of bridges which have been broken or injured by the\r\nenemy, and where quick repair is of importance to an army’s movements.\r\nThese troops charged with bridge construction usually form a part of the\r\nreserve, and are only attached to a division under peculiar\r\ncircumstances. There should be also in the reserve several companies of\r\nsappers and miners; their number, like the heavy artillery, being\r\ndependent upon the nature of the campaign.\r\n\r\n_The army_, as a machine, is now ready to be used by the general. The\r\nnext step is to keep it in a condition so that it can be used; in other\r\nwords, to _preserve_ the fighting condition of the army. The discipline\r\nand drill have been cared for, and with the organization just sketched\r\nout, the general can move the whole mass as a unit in accordance with\r\nhis will. The army can be kept ready for use only by supplying all the\r\nactual and necessary wants of the soldier, and by keeping him in comfort\r\nand good health. To do this there must be ammunition, clothing, food,\r\nshelter, medicines, surgical attendance, hospital comforts, etc.,\r\nprovided for his use. Also a good system of recruiting must be adopted,\r\nby means of which the natural losses due to sickness and death may be\r\nmade good.\r\n\r\n_The transportation_ of the munitions, equipments, provisions, hospital\r\nsupplies, tents, engineering tools, bridge equipage and boats, baggage,\r\ncooking utensils, etc., necessary for the use of an army moving against\r\nan enemy, requires the use of large numbers of wagons and a great number\r\nof draught animals, which of course should not exceed the absolute\r\nnecessity of the service. These accompaniments to the army received from\r\nthe Romans the name of _impedimenta_, for the reason that they hindered\r\nthe movement of the army. These supply departments form important parts\r\nof the composition of a modern army, and the method of executing the\r\nduties assigned them constitutes an important branch of the “science and\r\nart of war.”--_Prof. J. B. Wheeler._\r\n\r\n=Organize.= To arrange or constitute in parts, each having a special\r\nfunction, act, office, or relation; as, to organize an army, etc.\r\n\r\n=Orgue= (Fr. _un orgue_). A term used to express that arrangement or\r\ndisposition of a certain quantity of musket-barrels in a row, which, by\r\nmeans of a priming train of gunpowder, may be subjected to one general\r\nexplosion. This machine has been found extremely serviceable in the\r\ndefense of a low flank, a tenaille, or to prevent an enemy from crossing\r\nthe ditch of a fortified place.\r\n\r\n=Orgues.= Are beams of wood hanging perpendicularly over the entrance of\r\na fortified town, which were formerly used as a portcullis, to be\r\ndropped in case of any emergency. They are not now used.\r\n\r\n=Orient.= The east or eastern part of the horizon. In surveying, _to\r\norient_ a plan signifies to make its situation or bearing with respect\r\nto the four cardinal points.\r\n\r\n=Oriflamme=, or =Auriflamme=. A banner which originally belonged to the\r\nabbey of St. Denis, and was borne by the counts of Vexin, patrons of\r\nthat church, but which, after the country of Vexin fell into the hands\r\nof the French crown, became the principal banner of the kingdom. It was\r\ncharged with a saltire wavy or, with rays issuing from the centre\r\ncrossways. In later times the oriflamme became the insignia of the\r\nFrench infantry. The name seems also to have been given to other flags;\r\nthe oriflamme borne at Agincourt was an oblong red flag split into five\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n=Orihuela.= A town of Spain, in Valencia, on the Segura, 31 miles\r\nsouthwest from Alicante. It was a place of some importance in the\r\nMoorish invasion, and was held in 713 successfully by Theodoric against\r\nAbd-el-Aziz after the battle of the Guadalete. It was conquered in 1265\r\nby Don Jaime of Aragon for his father-in-law, Don Alonso, king of\r\nCastile. The city was sacked in 1520 in the civil war at that time\r\nraging, and again in the War of the Succession, 1706. It was held for\r\nsome time in 1837 by the Carlist general Forcadell.\r\n\r\n=Orillon.= This may be described as a projection at the shoulder of a\r\nbastion beyond the ordinary flank of a curved portion of rampart and\r\nparapet, the curve being convex to the ditch. The orillon, introduced\r\nduring the 17th century, was generally used in conjunction with a\r\nretired flank, made ordinarily with a curve concave to the ditch. Both\r\norillon and retired flank are now obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Orissa.= An extensive province of Hindostan, in the Deccan. A race of\r\nHindoo princes governed the country till 1592, when they were conquered\r\nby the viceroy of Akbar. The French, who had taken possession of a part\r\nof the country long known as the Northern Circars, attempted to drive\r\nthe English (who had formed commercial settlements on the coast) out of\r\nIndia. The result of the contest for supremacy in India between the\r\nFrench and English is well known. The Mahrattas, who had seized a\r\nportion of Orissa in 1740, were forced to surrender it to the English in\r\n1803. The soldiers of the East India Company were marched into Orissa at\r\nthe commencement of the present century, and an engagement was\r\nsubsequently entered into between the Company and the native chiefs and\r\nprinces, by which the former bound themselves to perform certain\r\nservices for the country (as maintaining the river-banks in good\r\nrepair), while the latter engaged to pay a yearly tribute.\r\n\r\n=Orizaba.= A town of Mexico, in the department of Vera Cruz, 60 miles\r\nsouthwest from Vera Cruz. It was occupied by Gen. Prim, in command of\r\nthe Spanish troops that formed part of the expedition sent by England,\r\nFrance, and Spain to Mexico in March, 1862. A conference was held here\r\nshortly after the occupation of the town between the plenipotentiaries\r\nof the three powers, when the English and Spanish commissioners\r\ndetermined to withdraw their contingents from Mexico, in accordance with\r\nthe terms of the treaty of Soledad, while the French on the other hand\r\nresolved to push on to the capital, to establish a settled government in\r\nthe country in lieu of that of Juarez.\r\n\r\n=Orkney Islands= (anc. _Orcades_). A cluster of islands in the North\r\nSea, separated from the north coast of Scotland by the Pentland Firth.\r\nFrom an early period the Norsemen resorted to these islands as a\r\nconvenient spot from which to make a descent on the Scotch and English\r\ncoasts. In 876 Harald Haarfager conquered both them and the Hebrides;\r\nthey were conquered by Magnus III. of Norway in 1499, and were ceded to\r\nJames III. in 1469.\r\n\r\n=Orle.= In heraldry, one of the charges known under the charge of\r\nsub-ordinaries, said to be the diminutive of a bordure, but differing\r\nfrom it in being detached from the sides of the shield. Or an orle gules\r\nwas the coat borne by John Baliol. An orle of heraldic charges of any\r\nkind denotes a certain number (generally eight) of these charges placed\r\nin orle, as in the coat of the old Scottish family of Gladstanes of that\r\nIlk; argent, a savage’s head couped, distilling drops of blood proper,\r\nthereon a bonnet composed of bay and holly leaves all proper, within an\r\norle of eight martlets sable.\r\n\r\n=Orléans.= An important town of France, capital of the department of\r\nLoiret, 75 miles south-southwest from Paris by railway. Orléans,\r\noriginally called _Genabum_, afterwards _Aureliani_ (probably from the\r\nemperor Aurelian), was besieged by Attila in 451, but relieved by the\r\nRomans, who here defeated Attila. It afterwards passed into the hands of\r\nthe Franks, was taken by the Northmen in 855, and again in 865. In 1428\r\nit was besieged by the English under the Duke of Bedford, but was\r\ndelivered from the besiegers by the inspiriting exertions of Joan of\r\nArc, who on this account is also named the Maid of Orléans. In the civil\r\nwars of the 16th century it was besieged in 1563 by the Duke of Guise,\r\nwho was assassinated before the walls. During the Franco-Prussian war,\r\n1870-71, Orléans was occupied by the Germans, September 27, and\r\nevacuated November 10, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Ormskirk.= A town of England, county of Lancaster, 12 miles north by\r\neast from Liverpool. Near this place, in 1644, the royalists were\r\ndefeated by the Parliamentary troops with great slaughter.\r\n\r\n=Ormus=, or =Ormuz=. A small island in the strait of the same name, at\r\nthe entrance of the Persian Gulf, and within 10 miles of the Persian\r\ncoast. It is about 12 miles in circumference, and belongs to the sultan\r\nof Muscat. It was occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century. The\r\ntown was demolished in 1622 by Shah Abbas, assisted by the English, and\r\nits trade was removed to Gombroon.\r\n\r\n=Ornamental Fireworks.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Ornaments, Military.= Are those parts of the dress of a soldier which\r\nare more for appearance or distinction than for absolute use, as plates\r\nfor belts, trimmings, etc.\r\n\r\n=Orneæ.= An ancient town in Argolis, near the frontiers of the territory\r\nof Philius, and 120 stadia from Argus.

A town of France, in the department of the Lower\r\nPyrenees, situated on the Gave de Pau, 25 miles northwest from Pau. It\r\nsuffered much during the civil wars in France after the Revolution. Near\r\nthis town the British and Spanish armies commanded by Wellington\r\ndefeated the French under Soult, February 27, 1814.\r\n\r\n=Ortona.= An ancient city of Latium, situated on the confines of the\r\nÆquian territory. It is twice mentioned during the wars of the Romans\r\nwith the latter people: first in 481 B.C., when it was besieged and\r\ntaken by the Æquians; and again in 457 B.C., when the Æquians by a\r\nsudden attack took Corbio, and after putting to the sword the Roman\r\ngarrison there, made themselves masters of Ortona also; but the consul\r\nHoratius engaged and defeated them at Mount Algidus, and after driving\r\nthem from that position, recovered possession both of Corbio and Ortona.\r\nNo mention of it is found in later times, and it probably ceased to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n=Orvieto.= Called in the time of the Longobards _Urbs Vetus_, of which\r\nits present name is a corruption, a city of Italy, province of Perugia;\r\nis of Etruscan origin, but of its early history nothing is known. It has\r\nbeen a place of residence and retreat in turbulent times of upwards of\r\nthirty popes.\r\n\r\n=Osage Indians.= A tribe of aborigines of Dakota stock who are located,\r\nto the number of about 2500, on a reservation in Indian Territory. They\r\nare divided into eight bands,--the Beavers, Big Chiefs, Big Hills, Black\r\nDogs, Clammores, Half-Breeds, Little Osages, and White Hairs, and have\r\nmade but little progress in civilization.\r\n\r\n=Oschatz.= A town of Saxony, circle of Leipsic, 31 miles east-southeast\r\nfrom Leipsic. It was here that the treaty of peace was concluded between\r\nFrederick the Great and the empress Maria Theresa which put an end to\r\nthe Seven Years’ War, in 1763.\r\n\r\n=Osci=, or =Opici=. One of the most ancient tribes of Italy; they\r\ninhabited the centre of the peninsula, from which they had driven out\r\nthe Siculi. Their principal settlement was in Campania, but we also find\r\nthem in parts of Latium and Samnium. They were subdued by the Sabines\r\nand Tyrrhenians, and disappeared from history at a comparatively early\r\nperiod. They were called in their own language _Uskus_.\r\n\r\n=Osnabruck=, or =Osnaburg=. A town in Hanover, 71 miles from Hanover.\r\nHere was concluded the peace of Westphalia in 1648.\r\n\r\n=Ossun.= A town of France, in the department of the Upper Pyrenees, 7\r\nmiles southwest from Tarbes. A great battle was fought with the\r\nSaracens, in the 8th century, in its neighborhood.\r\n\r\n=Ostend.= A fortified seaport town of Belgium, province of West\r\nFlanders, situated on the coast of the North Sea, 67 miles northwest\r\nfrom Brussels. During the war of the Dutch against Spain, Ostend\r\nsustained a memorable siege for more than three years (1601-4). So\r\ntremendous was the bombardment that the noise of the Spanish artillery\r\nis said to have been occasionally heard at London. At last, after a loss\r\nof 50,000 men on the part of the garrison, and 80,000 on that of the\r\nSpaniards, the town surrendered on honorable terms, and the Spanish\r\ngeneral Spinola was put in possession of Ostend, now reduced to heaps of\r\nruin. On the death of Charles II. of Spain, the French seized Ostend;\r\nbut in 1706, after the battle of Ramilies, it was retaken by the allies.\r\nIt was again taken by the French in 1745, but restored in 1748. In 1756\r\nthe French garrisoned this town for the empress queen Maria Theresa. In\r\n1792 the French once more took Ostend, which they evacuated in 1793, but\r\nregained in 1794. The English destroyed the works of the Bruges Canal;\r\nbut the wind shifting before they could re-embark, they surrendered to\r\nthe French, May 19, 1798.\r\n\r\n=Ostrolenka.= A town of Poland, on the Narew. Near here the French\r\nrepulsed the Russians under Essen, February 16, 1807, and an indecisive\r\nand bloody engagement took place between the Poles under Skrzynecki and\r\nthe Russians under Diebitsch, May 26, 1831.\r\n\r\n=Ostrovno.= A village of Russia, in the government of Mohilev, 90 miles\r\nnorthwest from Mohilev. The Russians were defeated here in 1812 by the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n=Oswego, Fort.= See FORT ONTARIO.\r\n\r\n=Oswestry.= A town of England, in Shropshire, 15 miles northwest from\r\nShrewsbury. Oswestry is said to derive its name (originally\r\n_Oswaldstree_) from Oswald, the king of Northumbria, who was slain here\r\nin the early part of the 7th century, in a battle fought with the\r\nferocious Penda, king of Mercia.\r\n\r\n=Otaheite=, or =Tahiti=. The largest of a cluster of islands in the\r\nSouth Pacific Ocean, that were frequently visited by Capt. Cook, and\r\nnamed by him the Society Islands. In 1799, King Pomare ceded the\r\ndistrict of Matavai to some English missionaries. Queen Pomare was\r\ncompelled to put herself under the protection of France, September 7,\r\n1843. She retracted, and Otaheite and the neighboring islands were taken\r\npossession of by Admiral Dupetit-Thuars in the name of the French king,\r\nNovember, 1843. The French imprisoned Mr. Prichard, the English consul,\r\nMarch 5, 1844, but the act was censured in France.\r\n\r\n=Otchakow.= A small town and seaport of South Russia, in the government\r\nof Kherson, 40 miles east-northeast from Odessa. During the Russian wars\r\nwith Turkey in the 18th century, Otchakow was alternately the property\r\nof each, until it was taken by Potemkin in 1788, and definitively\r\nannexed to the Russian dominions.\r\n\r\n=Otoes.= A tribe of Indians of Dakota stock who reside with the\r\nMissourias on a reservation in Nebraska. They are generally peaceful and\r\nindustrious, and number with their kindred tribe about 450.\r\n\r\n=Otomis=, or =Othomis=. An ancient tribe of Indians who are said to have\r\ninhabited the Valley of Mexico before the Aztecs. They are now scattered\r\nthrough different parts of the country, and having lost all tribal\r\ndistinctions are become amalgamated with other Mexican races.\r\n\r\n=Otricoli.= A town of Italy, 37 miles north of Rome. The Neapolitans\r\nwere defeated by the French in its neighborhood in 1798.\r\n\r\n=Ottawas.= A tribe of Algonkin Indians, who formerly resided on the\r\nshores of Lake Erie. They subsequently moved to Kansas, and in 1870\r\nsettled in Indian Territory, where they now prosper. They are well\r\nadvanced in civilization. A number of this tribe settled in Canada,\r\nwhere their descendants may yet be found; some are also settled on Lake\r\nMichigan with the Chippewas.\r\n\r\n=Otterburn= (or Chevy Chase), =Battle of=. Was fought in August, 1388; a\r\nfight which Froissart declares to have been the bravest and most\r\nchivalrous which was fought in his day. According to the ballad (named\r\nChevy Chase) Percy vowed that he would enter Scotland and take his\r\npleasure for three days in the woods of his rival, and slay the deer\r\ntherein at will. Douglas, when he heard the vaunt, exclaimed, “Tell him\r\nhe will find one day more than enough.” Accordingly, at the time of the\r\nhay harvest, Percy, with stag-hounds and archers, passed into the\r\ndomains of his foe, and slew a “hundred fallow deer and harts of grice.”\r\nWhen the English had hastily cooked their game and were about to retire,\r\nEarl Douglas, clad in armor and heading his Scottish spears, came on the\r\nscene. Haughty challenge and defiance passed between the potentates, and\r\nthe battle joined. In the centre of the fray the two leaders met. “Yield\r\nthee, Percy!” cried Douglas. “I will yield to no Scot that was ever born\r\nof a woman!” cried Percy. During this colloquy, an English arrow struck\r\nDouglas to the heart. “Fight on, my merry men!” cried he, as he died.\r\nPercy, with all the chivalrous feeling of his race, took the dead man by\r\nthe hand, and vowed that he would have given all his lands to save him,\r\nfor a braver knight never fell by such a chance. Sir Hugh Montgomery\r\nhaving seen the fall of Douglas, clapped spurs to his horse, dashed on\r\nPercy, and struck his spear through his body, a long cloth-yard and\r\nmore. Although the leaders on both sides had fallen, the battle, which\r\nhad begun at break of day, continued till the ringing of the\r\ncurfew-bell. Scotsmen and Englishmen claim the victory. When the battle\r\nended, representatives of every noble family on either side of the\r\nborder lay on the bloody greensward.\r\n\r\n=Oude=, or =Oudh=. A province of British India, separated on the north\r\nfrom Nepaul by the lower ranges of the Himalaya, whence it gradually\r\nslopes to the Ganges, which forms its boundary on the south and\r\nsouthwest. The people of this province are of a decidedly warlike\r\ndisposition; they mainly supply the famous (or infamous) Sepoys of the\r\nBengal army. Oude is believed by Sanscrit scholars to be the ancient\r\nKosala, the oldest seat of civilization in India. The country was\r\nconquered by a Mohammedan army in 1195, and made a province of the Mogul\r\nempire. In 1753 the vizier of Oude, Saffdar Jung, rebelled against his\r\nimperial master, Ahmed Shah, and forced the latter to make the\r\ngovernorship hereditary in his family. When the mutiny of 1857 broke\r\nout, Oude became one of the great centres of rebellion. The country was\r\nsubdued by the British.\r\n\r\n=Oudenarde= (Fr. _Audenarde_). A town of Belgium, in East Flanders, 14\r\nmiles southwest from Ghent. The town was taken by the French, aided by\r\nan English force, in 1658; it was again besieged in 1674 by the\r\nstadtholder William (III. of England) of Orange; and in 1706 it was\r\ntaken by Marlborough. An attempt made by the French to retake it brought\r\non the famous battle of Oudenarde, one of Marlborough’s most celebrated\r\nvictories, which was gained on July 11, 1708, with the aid of Prince\r\nEugène, over a French army under the Duke of Burgundy and Marshal\r\nVillars. After this battle the French king made offers of peace, which\r\nwere not accepted.\r\n\r\n=Oulart= (Southeast Ireland). Here 5000 Irish insurgents attacked the\r\nking’s troops in small number, May 27, 1798. The North Cork militia,\r\nafter great feats of bravery, were cut to pieces, 5 men only escaping.\r\n\r\n=Ourique.= A town of Portugal, province of Alemtijo, 30 miles southwest\r\nof Beja. Hero Alfonso, count or duke of Portugal, is said to have\r\nencountered and signally defeated five Saracen kings and a prodigious\r\narmy of Moors, July 25, 1139, and to have been hailed king on the spot.\r\nLisbon, the capital, was taken, and he soon after was here crowned as\r\nthe first king, the Moorish dominion being overthrown.\r\n\r\n=Outbar.= To shut out by fortification.\r\n\r\n=Outbrave.= To excel in bravery or boldness; to defy.\r\n\r\n=Outfit.= In the British service, is the necessaries, uniform, etc.,\r\nwhich an officer provides when he is gazetted to a regiment, or as\r\nproceeding to India.

Is the succession of lines that show the figure\r\nof the works, and indicate the direction in which the defensive masses\r\nare laid out, in order to obtain a proper defense.\r\n\r\n=Outlyers.= In the British service, formerly this term applied to men\r\nwho were permitted to work, on condition that the whole of their pay was\r\nleft in the hands of their captain for the time they were so employed.\r\nThis sum the officer appropriated to his own use, to enable him to\r\nincrease his pay and to keep a handsome table when he mounted guard. It\r\nwas also a common practice to place on the muster-rolls the names of\r\nofficers’ children, and instances have occurred of girls receiving men’s\r\npay as outlyers.\r\n\r\n=Outlying.= Lying or being at a distance from the main body; as,\r\noutlying pickets. Also, being on the exterior or frontier.\r\n\r\n=Outmanœuvre.= To surpass in manœuvring.\r\n\r\n=Outmarch.= To march faster than; to march so as to leave behind; as,\r\nthe horse outmarched the foot.\r\n\r\n=Outnumber.= To exceed in number; as, the French were outnumbered.\r\n\r\n=Outpart.= At a distance from the main body.\r\n\r\n=Out-pensioner.= A pensioner attached to a hospital, as Greenwich or\r\nChelsea, England, who has liberty to live where he pleases.\r\n\r\n=Outpost.= A post or station without the limits of a camp, or at a\r\ndistance from the main body of an army. The troops placed at such a\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n=Outposts.= The term, _outposts_, is used at the present time to\r\ndesignate the particular detachments of troops and the method of\r\narranging them, by means of which an army when in bivouac, in camp, or\r\nin cantonment, is protected _from surprise_ by an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Outrank.= To take the precedence of, or be superior to, in rank; to\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n=Out-sentry.= A sentry who guards the entrance or approach to a place;\r\nan outguard.\r\n\r\n=Outside.= In fencing, that part which is to the right of the line of\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\n=Outside Guard.= A guard used with the broadsword and sabre, to defend\r\nthe outside of the position.\r\n\r\n=Outwall.= The exterior wall of a building or fortress.\r\n\r\n=Outward Face.= A word of command for troops to face to the right and\r\nleft from their centre.\r\n\r\n=Outwing, To.= To extend the flanks of an army or line in action, so as\r\nto gain an advantageous position against the right or left wing of an\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n=Outworks.= In fortification, are minor defenses constructed beyond the\r\nmain body of a work, for the purpose of keeping the enemy at a distance,\r\nor commanding certain salient points which it is undesirable that he\r\nshould occupy. Such works are ravelins, lunettes, hornworks,\r\ncrown-works, demi-lunes, tenailles, etc. They occur in certain necessary\r\norder, as a ravelin before the curtain and tenaille, a hornwork before a\r\nravelin, and so on.\r\n\r\n=Ovation.= See TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\n=Ovens.= Are always provided in garrisons, so that the troops may bake\r\ntheir own bread. A large saving of flour is thus made, which is the most\r\nconsiderable element of the post fund. A brick oven large enough to bake\r\n500 rations can be constructed in less than twenty-four hours. The\r\ncylindrical form is greatly to be preferred, as it is more easily made\r\nand requires less material than the ordinary forms. The want of brick\r\nfor the arch and fireplace of ovens may be supplied in the field by two\r\ngabions of semicircular or semi-elliptical form. They are placed one\r\nabove the other on the flat side, and form a cradle. The interior and\r\nexterior is plastered with clay, which must penetrate the interstices of\r\nthe basket-work. The front and back parts are shut in the same manner,\r\nor with sods. The cradle is then covered with earth to retain the heat;\r\nand in order that the superincumbent weight may not cause it to give\r\nway, withes are attached to the top of the basket-work, passed\r\nvertically through the embankment, and then fastened to the longitudinal\r\nbeam of a wooden horse straddled against the exterior curve. Ovens may\r\nalso be made of wood or earth. To construct rapidly an earthen oven, dig\r\na slope with a step, and on its prolongation dig the length of the oven\r\nin a trench separated from the step by a mass of earth, to be pierced\r\nlater as the mouth of the oven. Then dig laterally portions of an\r\nelliptical arch so as to make the arch a given breadth. This work\r\nfinished, pierce the mouth, and cover the trench with from three to five\r\nsods as arch stones, leaving a chimney-place at the bottom. Ovens for\r\nfrom 100 to 250 rations may be thus made. In some European armies they\r\nhave very convenient portable ovens.\r\n\r\n=Over.= Above in place, position, or authority; as, he was placed in\r\ncommand over Lord Monkton.\r\n\r\n=Overcharge.= An excessive charge, as of a gun.\r\n\r\n=Overcharge.= To fill with too much powder and ball, as a gun.\r\n\r\n=Overcharged Mine.= A mine whose crater is wider at top than it is deep.\r\n\r\n=Overlap.= Is to overspread any preceding object. In marching by echelon\r\nfor the purpose of forming upon any given point, but particularly in\r\nwheeling from column into line, troops may lose their relative distances\r\nby not taking ground enough; when this occurs, the rear division,\r\ncompany, or section, unavoidably crowds upon its preceding one, and is\r\nthen said to overlap.\r\n\r\n=Overmarch.= To fatigue or wear out by too much marching.\r\n\r\n=Overmatch.= To be too powerful for; to conquer; to subdue; to suppress\r\nby superior force. Also, one superior in power; one able to overcome.\r\n\r\n=Overpower.= To vanquish by force; to subdue; to defeat.\r\n\r\n=Overrun.= In a military sense, to ravage, to lay waste. A country which\r\nis harassed by incursions is said to be overrun.\r\n\r\n=Overseer.= An officer in the ordnance department, who superintends the\r\nartificers in the construction of works, etc. He is also called a\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\n=Overshoot.= To shoot beyond the mark.\r\n\r\n=Overslaugh.= To hinder or stop; as, by an overslaugh or unexpected\r\nimpediment; as, to overslaugh a military officer, that is, to hinder or\r\nstop his promotion or employment by the appointment of another to his\r\nrank or duties.\r\n\r\n=Overthrow.= Total defeat; discomfiture; rout.\r\n\r\n=Overturn.= To overthrow; to conquer.\r\n\r\n=Oviedo.= A town of Spain, capital of the province of the same name, 55\r\nmiles north-northwest of Leon. This city was twice plundered of its\r\necclesiastical and other treasures during the war of independence, first\r\nby Soult, and subsequently by Bonnet.\r\n\r\n=Own, King’s= or =Queen’s=. A term which has been attached to some\r\nBritish regiments since the revolution in 1688. Thus the 4th Foot, which\r\nlanded with William III., was called the 4th King’s Own.\r\n\r\n=Owyhee=, or =Hawaii=. An island in the North Pacific Ocean, the most\r\neastern, and by far the largest of the Sandwich Islands. It was on this\r\nisland that the celebrated Capt. Cook fell a sacrifice to a\r\nmisunderstanding, or sudden impulse of revenge on the part of the\r\nnatives, on Sunday, February 14, 1779.\r\n\r\n=Ox.= See BULLOCK.\r\n\r\n=Oxford.= An ancient and famous city in England, the chief town of the\r\ncounty of Oxford, 55 miles west-northwest from London. The townsmen\r\nclosed their gates against William the Conqueror, who stormed the town\r\nin 1067, and gave it to one of his followers, Robert d’Oyley, who built\r\na castle here to overawe the disaffected Saxons. The paction that\r\nterminated the strife between Stephen and Henry II. was drawn up at\r\nOxford. During the great civil war of the 17th century, it was for a\r\nwhile the headquarters of the royalist forces, and was conspicuous for\r\nits adherence to the cause of Charles I.\r\n\r\n=Oxford Blues.= See HORSE GUARDS, ROYAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pace= (Lat. _passus_). In its modern acceptation, is the distance, when\r\nthe legs are extended in walking, between the heel of one foot and that\r\nof the other. Among disciplined men the pace becomes one of constant\r\nlength, and as such is of the utmost value in determining military\r\nmovements, the relative distances of corps and men being fixed by the\r\nnumber of paces marched, and so on. The pace varies in different\r\ncountries; in the United States it is 28 inches direct step, and 33\r\ndouble step; in Great Britain 30 inches direct step, and 33 double step.\r\nWith the Romans the pace had a different signification; the single\r\nextension of the legs was not with them a pace (_passus_), but a step\r\n(_gradus_); their pace being the interval between the mark of a heel and\r\nthe next mark of the same heel, or a double step. This pace was\r\nequivalent to 4.84 English feet.\r\n\r\n=Pack and Draught Animals.= All animals which are used as beasts of\r\nburden and of draught, and all artillery horses are considered under\r\nthis head. Taking the usual effect of a man’s daily labor as unity, a\r\nhorse can carry a load on a horizontal plane 4.8 to 6.1 times, and a\r\nmule, 7.6 times greater than a man. Taking a man with a wheel-barrow as\r\nunity, a horse in a four-wheel wagon can draw 17.5, and in a cart, 24.3,\r\nand a mule in a cart, 23.3 times greater burden. On account of the\r\npeculiar build of a mule he is a superior pack-animal to the horse.\r\nThere are from 91 to 130 draught horses required for a field-battery;\r\nfor siege-train about 1900 (see SIEGE-TRAIN); and 8 for a siege-gun. The\r\nload allotted to a light artillery horse is 700 pounds; to a heavy field\r\nartillery horse, 800 pounds; and to a siege artillery horse, 1000\r\npounds, including weight of carriages. It is less than that drawn by a\r\nhorse of commerce, in consequence of bad roads, bad forage, rapid\r\nmovements, and forced marches. A team of four horses can draw, with\r\nuseful effect, including the weight of carriage, 2400 pounds; six\r\nhorses, 3000 pounds; eight horses, 3600 pounds; and twelve horses, 4800\r\npounds. It is usual to estimate the weight of a carriage exceeding 1200\r\npounds as part of the load. A pack-horse can carry 250 to 300 pounds 20\r\nmiles a day; and a draught horse, 1600 pounds 23 miles a day, weight of\r\ncarriage included. Usually a horse can draw seven times as much as he\r\ncan carry. An ordinary march is about 15 miles at 2¹⁄₂ miles per hour\r\nfor six hours; this must depend upon the condition of the horses, state\r\nof the roads, and various other circumstances. Horses starting fresh,\r\nand resting after their work, may, on tolerable roads, perform 2 miles\r\nin half an hour; 4 miles in one and a half hours; 8 in four, and 16 in\r\nten hours. The daily allowance of water for a horse is four gallons. For\r\nthe daily ration of forage supplied to animals in the U. S. service, see\r\nFORAGE. An army requires to be accompanied by several thousand\r\npack-animals, sometimes horses, but preferably mules; and in Asia,\r\ncommonly camels, or even elephants. In battle, the immediate reserves of\r\nsmall-arm ammunition are borne in the rear of divisions by pack-animals;\r\nthe heavy reserves being in wagons between the army and its base of\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n_Buffalo._--An animal of the ox tribe, very important and useful to man.\r\nIt is a native of the East Indies, where it has long been domesticated,\r\nand from which it was carried to Egypt and the south of Europe. It was\r\nintroduced into Italy about the close of the 6th century A.D., is now\r\nvery generally used as a beast of draught and of burden in that country,\r\nas it is also in India; it is also used in the latter country by the\r\nmilitary as a beast of burden.\r\n\r\n_Bullock._--This beast is admirable for slow draught, especially over\r\nrough roads, or through forests, or other places where there are no\r\nroads at all. Bullocks stand fire better than any other animals, and\r\nused to be employed in India for draught in field-batteries. They must\r\nnot be hurried; their ordinary pace is from 2 to 2¹⁄₂ miles an hour. If\r\nused over hard roads, they require shoeing. They want but little care,\r\nand thrive well on poor food. They attain their prime at six years, age\r\nto be known by annular swelling on horns, allowing three years for first\r\nring, and one for each of the others. They are used in many parts of\r\nIndia as pack-animals, when they carry a load of 200 pounds.\r\n\r\n_Camels._--These animals are used in East India from three to sixteen\r\nyears of age; about 7 feet high (to top of hump), about 8 feet long from\r\nnose to tail; pace about 2 miles an hour, kept up steadily for the\r\nlongest marches; load for work on service about 400 to 450 pounds. They\r\nthrive well upon leaves of trees, and can go without water longer than\r\nany other animal. During temporary halts the laden camel can kneel down\r\nand rest. They are admirably adapted for carrying long articles, such as\r\nscaling-ladders, pontons, etc. The camel is at home in the desert and\r\nworks well in the plains of India; it is unsuited for hilly countries.\r\nAfter rain in clay soil, and over rocks and stony places, they split up\r\nand are consequently useless there. They are good for fording rivers\r\nthat are deep but not rapid, and where the bottom of the river is\r\nshifting sand, the passage of a number of camels over it renders it hard\r\nand firm. The average weight of the camel is about 1170 pounds.\r\n\r\n_Elephant._--A gigantic animal of the order _Proboscidea_, is the\r\nlargest and heaviest of existing quadrupeds, and is celebrated for\r\nsagacity and docility. The ancient Carthaginians and other nations\r\nemployed elephants in war, not only as beasts of burden but as\r\ncombatants. These animals formed part of the army which Hannibal led\r\nacross the Alps, and they are said to have decided the victory at the\r\nbattle of Trebia. For a long period the elephant was as important an arm\r\nof war as the artillery of modern nations. Seleucus is said to have had\r\nmore than 100 elephants at the battle of Ipsus. The elephant is the king\r\nof beasts of burden, becoming fit for work at twenty years of age, and\r\nlasting well to fifty and even sixty years of age. The load for steady\r\nwork varies from 1680 to 2240 pounds exclusive of the pad; pace from 3\r\nto 3¹⁄₂ miles an hour; when laden can keep up well with infantry in\r\ntheir daily marches; full grown his height is from 10 feet to 11 feet;\r\nis most tractable in disposition, is invaluable during marches in\r\ncountries flooded by rain for extricating carts, guns, and wagons that\r\nhave stuck in the mud. They are now used in India for the draught of\r\nguns in siege-trains; before such guns are taken under fire it is\r\nnecessary to have the elephants taken out and replaced by bullocks, as\r\nthe former cannot be made to stand fire. The average weight of an\r\nelephant in India is about 6600 pounds. They are often used in hilly\r\ncountries to carry mountain guns on their back.\r\n\r\n_Lama_, or _Llama_.--Is a most useful South American quadruped of the\r\nfamily _Camelidæ_. It was in general use as a beast of burden on the\r\nPeruvian Andes at the time of the Spanish conquest, and was the only\r\nbeast of burden used by the natives of America before the horse and ass\r\nwere introduced by Europeans. From the peculiar formation of its feet it\r\ncan walk securely on slopes too rough and steep for any other animal.\r\nThe burden carried by the lama should not exceed 125 pounds, and its\r\nrate of traveling is about 12 to 15 miles per day.\r\n\r\n_Mule._--This is an excellent draught animal and almost rivals the horse\r\nfor general military purposes. Their common load, including weight of\r\npack-saddle, is from 200 to 250 pounds; height varies from 13 to 16\r\nhands. They will eat almost anything, and require less careful\r\nmanagement than the horse; the mule from the male ass and the mare is\r\nthe best; their voices take after the sire. The real value of the mule\r\nis felt most strongly in mountainous countries.\r\n\r\n=Packer.= A man whose duty it is to place and adjust the loads of\r\npack-animals and to take charge of them upon the march. As packing\r\nrequires long training and experience, packers are usually hired when\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n=Packing.= Is the act of making up and adjusting the load of a\r\npack-animal. It may be considered one of the arts.\r\n\r\n=Pack-mule.= Mule used for carrying a pack.\r\n\r\n=Pack-saddles= (Sp. _aparejos_). Are variously fitted, according to the\r\nobjects to be carried; some for provisions or ammunition; others for\r\ncarrying wounded men, tents, and, in mountain warfare, even small\r\ncannon. The one in general use in the U. S. army (called _aparejo_) is 4\r\nfeet 9 inches long by 2 feet wide.\r\n\r\nTo “set up” an aparejo.--Prepare straight, smooth sticks, from ¹⁄₂ to 1\r\ninch in diameter (wild-rose stems are the best, but any tough elastic\r\nwood will answer), and the coarsest grass that can be obtained. The\r\ngrass should be cut green, free from flower-stalks, and dried slowly in\r\nthe shade. Place the aparejo upside-down; take four sticks 1 inch in\r\ndiameter, cut them to fit tightly, two in the width and two in the\r\nlength; place one in each end, and one in each side of the compartment.\r\nThen place sticks ¹⁄₂ to ³⁄₄ of an inch in diameter, cut to fit tightly,\r\nlengthwise of the compartment at intervals of 2 inches. Shake the grass\r\nthoroughly, and place layer after layer on the sticks without displacing\r\nthem, until the compartment is as full as it can be stuffed with the\r\nhand. Great care is necessary to insure an equal distribution of the\r\ngrass in the compartment. The corners are stuffed as hard as possible, a\r\nsharp stick being used for the purpose. When the aparejo is stuffed, it\r\nshould be put on the mule for which it is intended, and the crupper\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nAn _aparejo cincha_ is canvas, 72 inches long and 20 wide, folded so as\r\nto bring the edges in the centre of the cincha. A semicircle of strong\r\nleather pierced with two holes is stitched on one end, and two loops of\r\nstrong leather on the other.\r\n\r\nThe _latigo strap_ is strong bridle leather, 72 inches long, 1¹⁄₂ inches\r\nwide at one end and tapering to ¹⁄₂ inch at the other. The wide end has\r\nholes punched in it. The aparejo cincha and latigo strap are used to\r\ntighten the aparejo.\r\n\r\nUnder the aparejo is placed a saddle-blanket, and a corona, or upper\r\nsaddle-blanket; the latter is made by stitching two or three folds of\r\nold blanket or other woolen cloth together. It is the same size as the\r\nsaddle-blanket and used over it.\r\n\r\nThe _hammer-cloth_ is made of matting or canvas, of a size to exactly\r\ncover the aparejo. Two pieces of hard wood 20 inches long, 2 inches\r\nwide, 1¹⁄₂ inches thick, flat on one side, round on the other, and\r\nbeveled to an edge at the ends, are placed 6 inches from the ends of the\r\ncloth. They have leather caps stitched over their ends. The hammer-cloth\r\nis used over the aparejo and under the aparejo cincha.\r\n\r\nThe _sling-rope_ is of half-inch rope, 16 feet long.\r\n\r\nThe _lash-rope_ is of one and a fourth inch hemp rope, 32 to 36 feet\r\nlong; one end spliced to the cincha ring, the other end served.\r\n\r\nThe _cincha_ is strong canvas, 33 inches long by 11 inches wide; two\r\nrectangular pieces of strong leather 8 inches long by 5¹⁄₂ inches wide\r\nare stitched on one end, one on either side; in one of these pieces of\r\nleather there is a slit through which a hard-wood hook is passed and\r\nfirmly fastened with a leather thong. There is a ring 3 inches in\r\ndiameter securely stitched in the other end of the cincha.\r\n\r\nThere is also a pack-cover made of canvas, 5 feet square; and a blind\r\nmade of leather, with strings and loop of the same material. The aparejo\r\nwhen securely placed on the pack-animal is a very serviceable\r\npack-saddle, and cannot readily be displaced.\r\n\r\n=Pack-train.= A number of loaded pack-animals with their drivers.\r\nPack-trains are employed in mountainous countries or regions impassable\r\nfor vehicles to carry supplies for armies. The mule is more generally\r\nserviceable in this work than the horse.\r\n\r\n=Padua= (anc. _Patavium_, It. _Padova_). A town of Italy, capital of the\r\nprovince of the same name. It is surrounded by walls and ditches, and is\r\nfortified by bastions. Patavium was founded by the Trojan chief Antenor,\r\nand according to Strabo, it could send an army of 120,000 men into the\r\nfield. The Patavians were constantly at war with, and successfully\r\nwithstood, the Cisalpine Gauls; and in 301 B.C. they also defeated\r\nCleonymus the Lacedæmonian, who had unexpectedly landed at the mouth of\r\nthe _Medoacus_ (the modern Brenta), and attacked them. Patavium fell\r\neventually under the power of Rome, though it seems to have retained a\r\nsemblance of independence. In 452 its prosperity came suddenly to an\r\nend, when it was taken and destroyed by Attila; and in 601 it was again\r\ntaken and burnt to the ground by Agilulf, king of the Longobards. It\r\nrose, however, from its ashes, and in the 10th century it had already\r\nbecome, as it has continued, one of the most important cities of Upper\r\nItaly. In 1164 Padua formed, with Verona, Vicenza, and Treviso, a league\r\nfor the protection of their liberties against Frederick I. (Barbarossa);\r\nin 1167 it joined the great Lombard League; and by the peace of\r\nConstance in 1183 had at length its liberties acknowledged. In 1239,\r\nEccelino da Romano made himself master of it, and after having practiced\r\nunheard-of cruelties, in 1256 he was driven out and defeated by a\r\ncrusade formed against him by most of the towns in Upper Italy. After a\r\nperiod of stormy independence, Padua in 1337 fell under the sway of the\r\nhouse of Carrara, who held it till the year 1405, when it was taken by\r\nthe republic of Venice, with which, in 1797, it passed into the hands of\r\nAustria, by the treaty of Campo Formio. In 1866 it was ceded to\r\nNapoleon III., and by him transferred to the kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Pæones.= A powerful Thracian people, who in early times were spread\r\nover a great part of Macedonia and Thrace. Their country was called\r\nPæonia. The Pæonian tribes on the lower course of the Strymon were\r\nsubdued by the Persians, 513 B.C.; but the tribes in the north of the\r\ncountry maintained their independence. They frequently invaded and\r\nplundered the territories of the Macedonian monarchs; but they were\r\neventually subdued by Philip, the father of Alexander the Great. After\r\nthe conquest of Macedonia by the Romans, 168, the part of Pæonia east of\r\nthe Axius formed the second, and the part of Pæonia west of the Axius\r\nformed the third of the four districts into which Macedonia was divided\r\nby the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Pæstum= (anc. _Posidonia_, It. _Pesto_). Anciently a Greek city of\r\nLucania, in the present Neapolitan province of Principato Citeriore, on\r\nthe _Sinus Pæstanus_, now the Gulf of Salerno. It was founded by the\r\nTrœzenians and the Sybarites some time between 650 and 610 B.C. It was\r\nsubdued by the Samnites of Lucania, who named it Pæstum, and slowly\r\ndeclined in prosperity after it fell into the hands of the Romans, who\r\nestablished a colony here about 273 B.C. In 210 B.C. it furnished ships\r\nto the squadron with which D. Quintus repaired to the siege of Tarentum;\r\nand in the following year it was among the eighteen colonies which still\r\nprofessed readiness to furnish supplies to the Roman armies. In the 10th\r\ncentury it was burnt by the Saracens, and the site is now occupied by\r\nthe modern village of Pesto.\r\n\r\n=Pageant.= In ancient military history, a triumphal car, chariot, or\r\narch, variously adorned with colors, flags, etc., carried about in\r\npublic shows, processions, etc. Also gorgeous show or spectacle.\r\n\r\n=Pagræ= (now _Pagras_, _Bagras_, _Bargas_). A city of Syria, on the\r\neastern side of Mount Amanus, at the foot of the pass called by Ptolemy\r\nthe Syrian Gates, on the road from Antioch to Alexandria, the scene of\r\nthe battle between Alexander Balas and Demetrius Nicator, 145 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Pah.= The name of the stockaded intrenchments of the New Zealanders.\r\n\r\n=Pah-Ute Indians.= A tribe of aborigines of Shoshone stock, who, to the\r\nnumber of 2000, reside on two reservations in Nevada. (See INDIANS AND\r\nTHEIR AGENCIES.) They are a peaceable race, but are low down in the\r\nscale of civilization.\r\n\r\n=Pailler= (_Fr._). An ancient body of French militia. The soldiers\r\nbelonging to it were probably so called either from the circumstance of\r\ntheir wearing straw in their helmets, in order to know one another in\r\naction, or because they were accustomed to set fire to the habitations\r\nof their enemies with bundles of straw, which they always carried with\r\nthem for that purpose.\r\n\r\n=Paladin= (_Fr._). A name given to those ancient knights who were\r\neither what the French call _comtes du palais_, “counts of the palace,”\r\nor princes lineally descended from Charlemagne and other old kings.\r\n\r\n=Paladin.= A term originally derived from the counts Palatine, or of the\r\npalace, who were the highest dignitaries in the Byzantine court, and\r\nthence used generally for a lord or chieftain, and by the Italian\r\nromantic poets for a knight-errant.\r\n\r\n=Palæsta= (now _Palasa_). A town of Epirus, on the coast of Chaonia, and\r\na little south of the Acroceraunian Mountains. Here Cæsar landed his\r\nforces when he crossed over to Greece to carry on the war against\r\nPompey.\r\n\r\n=Palæstra.= In Grecian antiquity, a public building where the youth\r\nexercised themselves in the military art, wrestling, running, etc.\r\n\r\n=Palais Royal.= A heterogeneous mass of buildings on the eastern side of\r\nthe Rue Richelieu, in Paris, composed of a palace, theatres, public\r\ngardens, shops, cafés, etc. The old palace was built between 1624 and\r\n1636 on the site of the Hôtel Rambouillet by Cardinal Richelieu, who, at\r\nhis death, bequeathed it to Louis XIII. It was taken possession of by\r\nthe republican government, and used for the sittings of the tribunes\r\nduring the Reign of Terror. The palace was sacked by the mob during the\r\nrevolution of 1848.\r\n\r\n=Palanka.= A species of permanent intrenched camp attached to Turkish\r\nfrontier fortresses, in which the ramparts are revetted with large\r\nbeams, rising 7 or 8 feet above the earthwork, so as to form a strong\r\npalisade above.\r\n\r\n=Palanquin= (Hind. _palki_). A vehicle commonly used in Hindostan,\r\nChina, Japan, and other Asiatic countries by travelers. The palanquin in\r\nuse in Hindostan is a wooden box, about 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4\r\nfeet high, with wooden shutters, which can be opened or shut at\r\npleasure, and constructed like Venetian blinds for the purpose of\r\nadmitting fresh air, while, at the same time, they exclude the scorching\r\nrays of the sun and the heavy showers of rain so common in that country.\r\nAt each end of the palanquin, on the outside, two iron rings are fixed,\r\nand the _hammals_, or palanquin-bearers, of whom there are four, two at\r\neach end, support the palanquin by a pole passing through these rings.\r\nTraveling in this mode is continued both by day and night, and the\r\npalanquin is accompanied by a train of attendants, who carry the\r\ntraveler’s clothes and whatever articles he may not immediately need.\r\nSimilar modes of traveling have been at various times in use in Western\r\nEurope, but only for short distances. The Roman _lectica_ (“litter”),\r\nthe French _chaise à porteurs_, and the English sedan-chair were the\r\nforms of vehicles most in use, and the two latter were in general use in\r\ntowns till they were superseded by coaches, etc. The Roman litter was\r\none of the criteria of its owner’s wealth, the rich man generally\r\nexhibiting the prosperous condition of his affairs by the multitude of\r\nthe bearers and other attendants accompanying him.\r\n\r\n=Palatinate, The= (Ger. _Pfalz_). A name applied to two German states,\r\nwhich were united previously to the year 1620. They were distinguished\r\nas the Upper and Lower Palatinate. The Upper now forms apart of the\r\nkingdom of Bavaria, and the Lower a part of Rhenish Prussia, situated on\r\nboth sides of the Rhine, between Worms and Carlsruhe. By the peace of\r\nLunéville (1801), the Duke Maximilian of Zweibrücken was compelled to\r\ncede a portion of the Rhenish Palatinate to France, a part to Baden, a\r\npart to Hesse-Darmstadt, and a part to Nassau. Treaties of Paris of 1814\r\nand 1815 re-assigned the Palatinate lands beyond the Rhine to Germany,\r\nBavaria receiving the largest share, and the remainder being divided\r\nbetween Hesse-Darmstadt and Prussia.\r\n\r\n=Palatine.= A town of Montgomery Co., N. Y., on the north side of the\r\nMohawk River. Near here, at Stone Arabia, an engagement took place\r\nOctober 18, 1780, between the Tories under Johnson and the Continental\r\nmilitia under Col. John Brown, in which the latter were defeated and\r\ntheir leader slain.\r\n\r\n=Pale.= In heraldry, one of the figures known as ordinaries, consisting\r\nof a horizontal band in the middle of the shield, of which it is said to\r\noccupy one-third. Several charges of any kind are said to be “in pale”\r\nwhen they stand over each other horizontally, as do the three lions of\r\nEngland. A shield divided through the middle by a horizontal line is\r\nsaid to be “parted per pale.” The pallet is the diminutive of the pale,\r\nand is most generally not borne singly. Three pallets gules were the\r\narms of Raymond, count of Provence. When the field is divided into an\r\neven number of parts by perpendicular lines, it is called “paly of” so\r\nmany pieces. When divided by lines perpendicular and bendways crossing,\r\nit is called “paly bendy.” An endorse is a further diminutive of the\r\npallet, and a pale placed between two endorses is said to be endorsed.\r\n\r\n=Pale.= In Irish history, means that portion of the kingdom over which\r\nthe English rule and English law were acknowledged. There is so much\r\nvagueness in the meaning of the term, that a few words of explanation\r\nappear necessary. The vagueness arises from the great fluctuations which\r\nthe English authority underwent in Ireland at various periods, and from\r\nthe consequent fluctuation of the actual territorial limits of the Pale.\r\nThe designation dates from the reign of John, who distributed the\r\nportion of Ireland then nominally subject to England into twelve\r\ncounties palatine, Dublin, Meath, Kildare, Louth, Carlow, Kilkenny,\r\nWexford, Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, and Limerick. To this entire\r\ndistrict, in a general way, was afterwards given the designation of the\r\nPale. But as it may be said that the term is commonly applied by the\r\nwriters of each age to the actual English territory of the period, and\r\nas this varied much, care must be taken to allude to the age of which\r\nthe name Pale is used. Thus at the close of the reign of Edward III.,\r\nthe English law extended only to the four counties of Dublin, Carlow,\r\nMeath, and Louth. In the reign of Henry VI., the limits were still\r\nfurther restricted. In a general way, however, the Pale may be\r\nconsidered as comprising the counties of Dublin, Meath, Carlow,\r\nKilkenny, and Louth. This, although not quite exact, will be sufficient\r\nfor most purposes.\r\n\r\n=Paleagas.= See POLYGARS.\r\n\r\n=Palembang.= A Dutch province in the island of Sumatra, comprehending\r\nthe former kingdom of that name. In 1811 the Dutch had merely a\r\ncommercial factory at Palembang, when the sultan began hostilities\r\nagainst them; and in order to insure their entire destruction, under\r\npretense of conveying them safely to Batavia, sunk during the night the\r\nships in which they had embarked by means of holes previously made. The\r\nDutch regained Palembang in 1816. The Dutch factory was cannonaded by\r\nthe sultan’s forces in 1818, and the country remained in rebellion until\r\n1821, when it was entirely conquered by the Dutch. The sultan still\r\nretains his title, but the supreme power is exercised by a Dutch regent,\r\nwho resides at Palembang, the capital.\r\n\r\n=Palermo= (anc. _Panormus_). A fortified city of Sicily, situated on the\r\nnorth side of the island. Palermo is of Phœnician origin, and is first\r\nbrought into notice in 480 B.C., when the Carthaginians under Hamilcar\r\nmade it their headquarters against Himera. How it came into their hands\r\nwe have no means of knowing; but it continued for a long time to be\r\ntheir principal naval station, and the capital of their possessions in\r\nSicily. With the exception of a short time, about 276 B.C., when it was\r\ntaken by the Greeks, it continued to be the headquarters of the\r\nCarthaginians, until it was taken by the Romans during the first Punic\r\nwar (254 B.C.). When Sicily was conquered by the Goths, Palermo, along\r\nwith the rest of the island, fell into their hands; but it was recovered\r\nby Belisarius, and the Byzantine empire retained possession of it till\r\n855 A.D., when it was taken by the Saracens, and made the capital of\r\ntheir Sicilian possessions. The Vandals and afterwards the Arabs made it\r\nthe capital of the island, and after the Norman conquest it continued to\r\nbe the seat of the king of Sicily. It still remained the royal residence\r\nunder the Aragonese kings; but the court was removed (1269) after Sicily\r\nbecame united to the kingdom of Naples. In 1860 the inhabitants flocked\r\nto the standard of Garibaldi, and in the same year the city was annexed\r\nto the new kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Palestine=, or =Holy Land=. A country of Asia, lying along the east\r\ncoast of the Mediterranean Sea, and occupying the southwestern part of\r\nSyria, which is included within the limits of the Turkish empire. It now\r\nforms the modern pashalic of Beirut or Beyrout, and part of the pashalic\r\nof Damascus. This is the country in which the principal events recorded\r\nin Scripture took place. When it was conquered by the Israelites, Joshua\r\ndivided this and a portion of the country to the east of the Jordan\r\namong the twelve tribes. It was conquered, however, by the kings of\r\nAssyria, who carried captive, first Israel and then Judah, into the\r\neastern provinces of their empire. After the conquest of Babylon by\r\nCyrus, the Jews were allowed to return to their country, to rebuild\r\ntheir temple, and re-establish their ecclesiastical constitution. Judæa\r\nthus continued a province of Persia until Asia was invaded by Alexander\r\nthe Great, to whom it submitted without resistance. The Jews were again\r\nexposed to oppression from some of the Ptolemies, who attempted to\r\nenforce the adoption of the idolatrous worship of the Greeks on the\r\nJewish people. The Jews, however, under the guidance of the Maccabees,\r\noffered a most determined resistance to the Egyptian monarch who sought\r\nto deprive them of the exercise of their own religion, and Judæa once\r\nmore became an independent country. It subsequently fell under the\r\ndominion of Rome, which established the Herods as tributary kings. It\r\nwas at this crisis that Judæa became the theatre of those great events\r\nwhich form the foundation of the Christian faith. The Jews, however,\r\nhaving repeatedly rebelled against the authority of the Romans, Titus\r\nentered Judæa with a large force in 70, and after a long siege, during\r\nwhich the Jews endured terrible hardships and privations, he took\r\nJerusalem, and razed it to the ground. The temple which had been twice\r\nrebuilt, after having been burnt by Nebuchadnezzar and plundered by\r\nAntiochus, was again destroyed. More than 1,100,000 Jews perished in the\r\nsiege and destruction of the city, and about sixty-five years after the\r\nJewish people were banished from Judæa by a decree of the emperor\r\nHadrian. The country continued to form a part of the Roman empire until\r\nit was divided into the Eastern and Western empires, when Palestine\r\nbecame a province of the former. Although it was frequently invaded by\r\nthe Parthians, Persians, and Saracens, it was held by the emperors of\r\nConstantinople until it was wrested from them by the last-named people\r\nin 638. It then fell under the sway of the Mohammedans, in whose power\r\nthe land remained until 1099, when the Holy Land was recovered by the\r\nCrusaders, and erected into a Latin kingdom under Godfrey de Bouillon.\r\nThis kingdom lasted till 1187, when it was conquered by Saladin, on the\r\ndecline of whose kingdom it passed through various hands, till, in 1517,\r\nit was finally swallowed up in the Turkish empire.\r\n\r\n=Palestrina= (anc. _Præneste_). An episcopal city of the present kingdom\r\nof Italy, built upon the site of one of the most ancient as well as\r\npowerful cities of Latium. We first hear of Præneste as member of the\r\nLatin League; but in 499 B.C. it quitted the confederacy and joined the\r\ncause of the Romans. In 380 B.C. the Prænestines, having rejoined their\r\nancient allies, waged war against Rome; but were completely routed on\r\nthe Allia by T. Quintus Cincinnatus, and beaten back to their own gates.\r\nThey took a prominent part in the famous Latin war, 340 B.C. Having\r\ngiven shelter to the younger Marius in the year 82 B.C., this city was\r\nbesieged by the forces of Sulla, and on its being taken, all the\r\ninhabitants were put to the sword. A military colony was then\r\nestablished in their place, and soon the city began to flourish anew.\r\nThe town became the stronghold of the family of Colonna in the Middle\r\nAges; but was given to the Barberini family by Urban VIII.\r\n\r\n=Palestro.= A village of Piedmont, 12 miles southwest from Novara. It is\r\nfamous as the scene of a battle between the Sardinians and Austrians in\r\nMay, 1859. On May 30 the Piedmontese drove the Austrians from this\r\nvillage, and on May 31 defended it with great bravery against an\r\nAustrian attack. The Piedmontese in the battle of May 31 were assisted\r\nby 3000 French Zouaves, and on that occasion the Austrians lost 2100 men\r\nkilled and wounded, 950 prisoners, and 6 pieces of cannon. On July 1 the\r\nallies entered Novara.\r\n\r\n=Palgaut.= A city of India, in the south of Hindostan, captured by the\r\nBritish in 1790.\r\n\r\n=Palisade.= To surround, inclose, or fortify with stakes or posts.\r\n\r\n=Palisades.= Are strong palings 6 or 7 inches broad on each side, having\r\nabout one foot of their summits sharpened in a pyramidal form. They are\r\nfrequently placed at the foot of slopes as an obstacle to the enemy. A\r\nlarge beam or lintel, sunk about 2 or 3 feet, is often used to unite\r\nthem more firmly. Their tops should be a foot above the crest of the\r\nparapet behind which they stand, and in field fortifications they form a\r\nvery good obstruction, if protected from artillery. An expeditious mode\r\nof planting them is to sink a small ditch, about 2 feet 6 inches deep\r\nand the same breadth, and to nail the ends of the palisades to a piece\r\nof timber, or the trunk of a tree laid on the bottom of it, and then\r\nfill in the earth, and ram it well. The palisades should be 9 or 10 feet\r\nlong, so that when finished, the ends shall be at least 7 feet above the\r\nground. They may be made out of the stems of young trees of 6 or 8\r\ninches diameter; but stout rails, gates with the ends knocked off,\r\nplanks split in half, cart-shafts, ladders, and a variety of such things\r\nwill come into play, where more regular palisades are not to be had. If\r\nthe materials are weak, a cross-piece must be nailed to them near the\r\ntop, to prevent their being broken down, and they must not be placed so\r\nclose together as to cover an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Palliser Gun.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Palmyra.= The name given by the Greeks to an ancient city of Upper\r\nSyria. It occupied a fertile oasis, 140 miles east-northeast from\r\nDamascus. Palmyra was, in the time of Solomon, a bulwark of the Hebrew\r\nkingdom against the wandering hordes of Bedouins. After the fall of\r\nSeleucia, it became a great commercial centre, and greatly increased\r\nboth in wealth and magnificence after the time of Trajan, who subjected\r\nthe whole country to the Roman empire. In the 3d century, Odonathus, a\r\nSyrian, founded here an empire, which, after his murder, rose to great\r\nprosperity under his wife, Zenobia, and included both Syria and\r\nMesopotamia; but this was not of long duration, for the Roman emperor\r\nAurelian conquered it in the year 275, and the city was soon after\r\nalmost entirely destroyed in revenge for the slaughter of a Roman\r\ngarrison. It never recovered from this blow, although Justinian\r\nfortified it anew. The Saracens destroyed it in 774, and in 1400 it was\r\nplundered by Tamerlane. A village called Tedmor, inhabited by a few Arab\r\nfamilies, now occupies its site.\r\n\r\n=Palo Alto.= A noted battle-field, situated near the southern extremity\r\nof Texas, between Point Isabel and Matamoras, about 9 miles northeast of\r\nthe latter. Here, on May 8, 1846, the Americans, numbering 2111, under\r\nGen. Taylor, defeated 6000 Mexicans, commanded by Gen. Arista. The loss\r\nof the former was 32 killed (among whom was the brave Maj. Ringgold),\r\nand 47 wounded; that of the latter, 252 killed.\r\n\r\n=Paludamentum.= Was a garment worn by the Romans, and differing little,\r\nif at all, from the chlamys. It was worn by the officers and principal\r\nmen in time of war, who were therefore called _paludati_, and this\r\ndistinguished them from the common soldiers, who, because they wore the\r\n_sagum_, were called the _sagati_. The _paludamentum_, which was\r\ngenerally white or red, came down to the knees, or lower, was open in\r\nfront, hung loosely over the shoulders, and was fastened across the\r\nchest by a clasp.\r\n\r\n=Paly.= In heraldry, divided into four or more equal parts by\r\nperpendicular lines, and of two different tinctures disposed\r\nalternately.\r\n\r\n=Pamphylia.= An ancient district on the south coast of Asia Minor, with\r\nCilicia on the east and Lycia on the west. It was originally bounded on\r\nthe inland or northern side by Mount Taurus, but was afterwards\r\nenlarged, so as to reach the confines of Phrygia. The inhabitants--a\r\nmixed race of aborigines, Cilicians and Greek colonists--spoke a\r\nlanguage the basis of which was probably Greek, but which was disfigured\r\nand corrupted by the infusion of barbaric elements. Along with Phrygia\r\nand Lycia, it fell to the share of Antigonus on the partition of the\r\nMacedonian empire. It afterwards passed successively into the hands of\r\nthe Græco-Syrian princes, the kings of Pergamus, and the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Pamplona=, or =Pampeluna=. A fortified town of Spain, the capital of\r\nthe province of Navarre, on the Arga, 39 miles southeast from St.\r\nSebastian. Pamplona was called by the ancients _Pompeiopolis_, from the\r\ncircumstance of its having been rebuilt by the sons of Pompey in 68 B.C.\r\nIt was taken by Euric the Goth in 466, by the Franks under Childebert in\r\n542, and again under Charlemagne in 778, who dismantled it. It was\r\nsubsequently for a time in possession of the Moors, who corrupted the\r\nname Pompeiopolis into Bambilonah, whence the modern Pamplona. In the\r\n11th century the three districts of the town were separately fortified.\r\nThe continual intestine contests of these three fortresses caused Carlos\r\nIII., in the beginning of the 15th century, to destroy the interior\r\nwalls and strengthen the common bulwarks; he also erected a citadel, in\r\nthe defense of which, against André de Foix, in 1521, St. Ignacio was\r\nwounded. It was taken by a stratagem by the French under D’Armagnac, and\r\nremained in their power until recaptured after a blockade by Wellington\r\nin 1813. In the civil war that followed the death of Ferdinand VII.,\r\nPamplona was the strong place of the liberals. The citadel was seized\r\nand held for a short time by O’Donnell in September, 1841.\r\n\r\n=Pan.= That part of the lock of a musket, pistol, etc., which holds the\r\npriming powder, the necessity of which is superseded by the use of\r\npercussion-caps.\r\n\r\n=Pan.= The distance which is comprised between the angle of the epaul\r\nand the flanked angle in a fortification.\r\n\r\n=Pan.= A name well known among the shepherds of antiquity, and\r\nfrequently used by modern writers in their rural fictions. In military\r\nhistory it signifies a man who was lieutenant-general to Bacchus and his\r\nIndian expedition. He is recorded to have been the first author of a\r\ngeneral shout, which the Grecians practiced in the beginning of their\r\nonsets in battle.\r\n\r\n=Pan Coupé.= The short length of parapet by which the salient angle of a\r\nwork is sometimes cut off.\r\n\r\n=Panache= (_Fr._). A plume worn upon the crest of an ancient helmet;\r\nmilitary plume or feather.\r\n\r\n=Pancarte= (_Fr._). An ancient exercise or tournament, which was\r\nperformed in the Roman amphitheatre, when strong athletic men were\r\nopposed to all sorts of enraged animals.\r\n\r\n=Pandoor.= See PANDOUR.\r\n\r\n=Pandosia= (now _Castel Franco_). A town in Bruttium (which see) near\r\nthe frontiers of Lucania. Lævinus, the Roman consul, was defeated at\r\nPandosia by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, 280 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Pandour= (from _Pandur_, a mountainous district of Hungary). The name\r\nhas been applied to that portion of the light-armed infantry in the\r\nAustrian service which is raised in the Slavonian districts on the\r\nTurkish frontier. The Pandours originally fought under the orders of\r\ntheir own proper chief, who was called Harun-Basha, and rendered\r\nessential service to the Austrians during the Spanish War of Succession,\r\nand afterwards in the Seven Years’ War. They originally fought after the\r\nfashion of the “free lances,” and were a terror to the enemy, whom they\r\nannoyed incessantly. Their appearance was exceedingly picturesque, being\r\nsomewhat oriental in character, and their arms consisted of a musket,\r\npistol, a Hungarian sabre, and two Turkish poniards. Their habits of\r\nbrigandage and cruelty rendered them, however, as much a terror to the\r\npeople they defended as to the enemy. Since 1750 they have been\r\ngradually put under a stricter discipline, and are now incorporated with\r\nthe Austrian frontier regiments.\r\n\r\n=Panic.= A sudden fright; especially, a sudden fright without real\r\ncause, or terror inspired by a trifling cause, or misapprehension of\r\ndanger; as, the troops were seized with a panic; they fled in a panic.\r\nThese terrors are attributed to Pan, as some say, because when Osiris\r\nwas bound by Typho, Pan and the satyrs appearing, cast him into a\r\nfright; or because he frightened all the giants that waged war against\r\nJupiter; or, as others say, that when Pan was Bacchus’s\r\nlieutenant-general in his Indian expedition, being encompassed in a\r\nvalley by an army of enemies far superior to them in number, he advised\r\nthe god to order his men to give a general shout, which so surprised the\r\nenemy that they immediately fled from their camp. And hence it came to\r\npass that all sudden fears impressed upon men’s spirits without any just\r\nreason were, by the Greeks and Romans, called _panic_ terrors.\r\n\r\n=Panic-stricken.= Struck with a panic or sudden fear; as, the troops\r\nwere panic-stricken.\r\n\r\n=Paniput=, or =Paneeput=. A town of British India, capital of a district\r\nof the same name in the territorial division of Delhi, Northwest\r\nProvinces, 78 miles north of Delhi, and 965 miles northwest of Calcutta.\r\nThe neighborhood of Paniput, lying in the great military highway between\r\nEastern India and Afghanistan, has been at various times the field of\r\ngreat battles. The _first_ great battle of Paniput was fought in 1526,\r\nand gained by Mirza Baber, the ex-ruler of Ferghana, at the head of\r\n12,000 Mongols, over Ibrahim, the emperor of Delhi, whose unwarlike\r\narray numbered 100,000 men, with 1000 elephants. This victory seated\r\nBaber on the throne of Hindostan as the first of the “Great Mogul”\r\ndynasty. The _second_ great battle was fought in 1556 by the Mongols\r\nunder Akbar, grandson of Baber, and third of the Mogul emperors, against\r\nHemu, an Indian prince, who had usurped the throne of Delhi. Hemu’s army\r\nwas defeated with great slaughter, and himself slain. The _third_\r\nbattle was fought on January 14, 1761, between Ahmed Abdalli, ruler of\r\nAfghanistan, and the till then invincible Mahrattas. The Jats, who had\r\nbeen forced to join the Mahrattas, deserted to the Afghans at a time\r\nwhen victory seemed to be declaring for the former; and this act of\r\ntreachery, together with the loss of their leaders, threw the Mahrattas\r\ninto confusion, and in spite of their most resolute valor they suffered\r\na total defeat. They left 50,000 slain on the field of battle, including\r\nall their leaders except Holkar, and 30,000 men were killed in the\r\npursuit, which was continued for four days. It was at Kurnaul, a town a\r\nlittle to the north of Paniput, that Nadir Shah of Persia, in 1739, won\r\nthe celebrated battle over the Mogul emperor, which placed Northwestern\r\nIndia at his feet.\r\n\r\n=Pannels.= Are the carriages upon which mortars and their beds are\r\nconveyed upon a march.\r\n\r\n=Pannier.= A shield of basket-work formerly used by archers, who set\r\nthem up in their front. Also a basket, usually slung in pairs over the\r\nback of a beast of burden to carry a load. The term is also applied to\r\nleather bags to be used in the same way, and especially to cases for\r\ncarrying medicines.\r\n\r\n=Pannonia.= A province of the ancient Roman empire, bounded on the north\r\nand east by the Danube, on the west by the mountains of Noricum, and on\r\nthe south reaching a little way across the Save; and thus including part\r\nof modern Hungary, Slavonia, parts of Bosnia, of Croatia, and of\r\nCarniola, Styria, and Lower Austria. The Pannonians (Pannonii) were a\r\nbrave, warlike people. They maintained their independence of Rome till\r\nAugustus, after his conquest of the Illyrians (35 B.C.), turned his arms\r\nagainst them; they were shortly afterwards subdued by his general\r\nVibius. In 7, the Pannonians joined the Dalmatians and the other\r\nIllyrian tribes in their revolt from Rome, and were with difficulty\r\nconquered by Tiberius, after a desperate struggle, which lasted three\r\nyears (7-9). The dangerous mutiny (14) of the Roman troops which were\r\ngarrisoned in Pannonia was with difficulty quelled by Drusus. Fifteen\r\nlegions had to be assembled against the Pannonians, who mustered 200,000\r\nwarriors. Great numbers of the Pannonian youth were drafted into the\r\nRoman legions, and proved, when disciplined, among the bravest and most\r\neffective soldiers in the imperial army. Pannonia was subsequently\r\ndivided into Upper and Lower Pannonia. Upper Pannonia was the scene of\r\nthe Marcomannic war in the 2d century. In the 5th century it was\r\ntransferred from the Western to the Eastern empire, and afterwards given\r\nup to the Huns. After Attila’s death, in 453, the Ostrogoths obtained\r\npossession of it. The Longobards under Alboin made themselves masters of\r\nit in 527, and relinquished it to the Avari upon commencing their\r\nexpedition to Italy. The Magyars, or Hungarians, took it in the end of\r\nthe 9th century.\r\n\r\n=Panonceau= (_Fr._). An ancient name for an ensign or banner.\r\n\r\n=Panoply.= Complete armor, or harness.\r\n\r\n=Papagos.= A tribe of Indians closely allied to the Pimas, who reside on\r\na reservation on the Santa Cruz River, in Arizona. They were converted\r\nto Christianity by Spanish missionaries at an early date, and are a\r\npeaceable and industrious race.\r\n\r\n=Papal States=, or =States of the Church=. A territory, or rather group\r\nof states in Central Italy, formerly united into one sovereignty, with\r\nthe pope for its head. The Papal States were bounded on the north by the\r\nPo, on the south by Naples, on the east by the Gulf of Venice and\r\nNaples, and on the west by Modena, Tuscany, and the Tyrrhenian Sea.\r\nDetached portions, as Benevento and Pontecorvo, lay within the\r\nNeapolitan territory. About 720, Gregory III. having quarreled with the\r\nemperor Leo the Isaurian, declared the independence of Rome. In 726,\r\nPepin le Bref compelled the Lombard king to hand over Ravenna, Rimini,\r\nPesaro, Fano, Cesena, Urbino, Forli, Comacchio, and fifteen other towns\r\nto the pope, who now assumed the state of a temporal sovereign. Pepin’s\r\nexample was followed by his son Charlemagne. In the 11th century the\r\nNormans greatly aided to increase the papal temporal authority, and in\r\n1053 the duchy of Benevento was annexed. In 1278 the emperor Rodolf I.\r\nconfirmed the popes in the acquisitions thus obtained, defined the\r\nboundaries of the Papal States, and absolved their inhabitants from\r\ntheir oath of allegiance to the empire. Sixtus IV. in the end of the\r\n15th century annexed the Romagna to his dominions. By the victory of the\r\nFrench at Marignan (1515), the very existence of the papal power was\r\nthreatened. In 1598 the possessions of the house of Este, viz.: Ferrara,\r\nComacchio, and a part of the Romagna, were seized by Pope Clement VIII.;\r\nand the Papal States received their final additions in Urbino (1623),\r\nRonciglione, and the duchy of Castro (1650). The Romagna was seized by\r\nNapoleon in 1797, and incorporated in the Cisalpine Republic; and in the\r\nfollowing year Rome was taken by the French, and the Papal States\r\nerected into the _Roman Republic_. Pius VII., in 1800, obtained\r\npossession of his states, but they were almost immediately retaken by\r\nthe French. In 1814, the pope returned to his dominions, and was\r\nformally reinstated by the treaty of Vienna. In 1830, the people of\r\nAncona and Bologna rose in rebellion; they were put down by the aid of\r\nan Austrian army. The Bolognese again rebelled; and this revolt supplied\r\nAustria with a pretext for occupying the northern Legations, and the\r\nFrench at the same time garrisoned Ancona. Occasional risings took place\r\nfrom time to time up to 1846. In 1848, the people rose, and Pius IX.\r\nfled to Gaeta, whilst Rome was proclaimed a republic. He was restored\r\nand his subjects reduced to submission by the arms of France, Austria,\r\nNaples, and Spain. The Austrians held the Legations in subjection to the\r\npope’s authority till 1859; the French occupied Rome in his behalf till\r\n1870. In July, 1859, the four northern Legations (the Romagna) taking\r\nadvantage of the withdrawal of the Austrian troops, threw off the papal\r\nauthority, and proclaimed their annexation to Sardinia, which was\r\nformally acknowledged by Victor Emmanuel in March, 1860. The pope now\r\nraised a large body of troops, appointing Lamoricière, an eminent French\r\ngeneral, to command them, for the purpose of resisting any further\r\nencroachments on his dominions; but the news of Garibaldi’s success in\r\nSicily and Naples produced revolt in the Legation of Urbino and in the\r\nMarches, the people proclaiming Victor Emmanuel. The Sardinians\r\naccordingly marched into the Papal States, defeated Lamoricière, who\r\nretired into Ancona, where he was compelled to surrender with his whole\r\narmy. The revolted provinces of Umbria, Urbino, and the Marches, and\r\npart of Frosinone were annexed to Sardinia. In September, 1870, the\r\nremaining states were occupied by the Italian troops, and the pope was\r\nremoved from temporal power. On October 2, 1870, the people pronounced\r\ntheir annexation to the kingdom of Italy, with which the territory of\r\nthe States of the Church was incorporated by decree of October 9, and\r\nGen. Marmora appointed governor of the new provinces.\r\n\r\n=Papegai= (_Fr._). A popinjay; a bird made of wood or pasteboard, stuck\r\nupon a lance, and used as a mark when practicing with the bow,\r\ncross-bow, musket, etc.\r\n\r\n=Paper Shell.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Paper Time-fuze.= See LABORATORY STORES.\r\n\r\n=Paphlagonia.= Was a country of Asia Minor, separated from Pontus on the\r\neast by the river Halys (_Kizil Ermak_), and from Bithynia on the west\r\nby the river Parthenius (_Bartan-Su_), and bounded on the north by the\r\nEuxine, and on the south by Galatia. Its limits, however, were somewhat\r\ndifferent at different times. The Paphlagonians are supposed to have\r\nbeen of Syrian, or at least of Semitic origin, and were a wild and\r\nwarlike people. Crœsus made Paphlagonia a part of the kingdom of Lydia,\r\nand Cyrus united it to Persia; it subsequently became part of the empire\r\nof Alexander the Great, and afterwards of the kingdom of Pontus, was\r\nincluded in the Roman province of Galatia, and in the 4th century of the\r\nChristian era was made a separate province by Constantine.\r\n\r\n=Papilio= (_Fr._). A square Roman tent for eight men.\r\n\r\n=Parachute Light Ball.= A thin shell, the upper half of which is blown\r\noff by the charge at a certain height. The lower half filled with\r\ncomposition, which is kindled by the explosion, is kept floating in the\r\nair by means of a small parachute, which is set free when the upper\r\nhalf of the shell flies off.\r\n\r\n=Parade.= Signifies in its original sense a prepared ground, and was\r\napplied to the court-yard of a castle, or to any inclosed and level\r\nplain. From the practice of reviewing troops at such a spot, the review\r\nitself has acquired the name of parade.\r\n\r\n=Parade.= To assemble troops in a uniform manner for the purpose of\r\nregular muster, exercise, and inspection. The parades are general,\r\nregimental, or private (troop, battery, or company), according to the\r\nstrength of the force assembled.\r\n\r\n=Parade.= In camp, is that spot of ground in the front of each\r\nencampment, between the camp colors, on the right and left wings.\r\n\r\n=Parade, Dress.= A parade which takes place in the U. S. army at the\r\ntroop or retreat on each evening, when the soldiers appear in full\r\nuniform and under arms.\r\n\r\n=Parade, Evening.= The hour generally fixed for the evening parade is at\r\nsunset. When troops are encamped, the signal for evening parade is given\r\nfrom the park of artillery, by the discharge of a piece of ordnance\r\ncalled the evening gun.\r\n\r\n=Parade Guard Mounting.= The parading of the soldiers who are to go on\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n=Parade, Morning.= In every garrison town, fortified place, and camp, as\r\nwell as in every town through which soldiers pass, or occasionally halt,\r\na certain hour in the morning is fixed for the assembling of the\r\ndifferent corps, troops, or companies, in regular order.\r\n\r\n=Parade Officer.= An officer who attends to the minutiæ of regimental\r\nduty, but who is not remarkable for military science.\r\n\r\n=Parade Rest.= A position of rest for soldiers, in which, however, they\r\nare required to be silent and motionless, used specially at parade;\r\nalso, the command for the position.\r\n\r\n=Parade, Troop.= Morning parade (which see).\r\n\r\n=Parade-ground.= The piece of ground on which soldiers are paraded.\r\n\r\n=Parados.= An elevation of earth which is effected behind fortified\r\nplaces, to secure them from any sudden attack that may be made in\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\n=Parætonium=, or =Ammonia=. Formerly an important city on the northeast\r\ncoast of Africa. It was a strong fortress; restored by Justinian, and\r\ncontinued a place of some consequence till its complete destruction by\r\nMehemet Ali in 1820.\r\n\r\n=Paraguay.= A republic in South America, discovered by Sebastian Cabot\r\nin 1526; conquered by Alvarez Nuñez in 1535, and civilized by the\r\nJesuits, who in 1608 commenced their missions there, and established an\r\nexclusive government, which they held until their expulsion in 1768.\r\nParaguay rose against the Spanish yoke in 1811, and achieved its\r\nindependence. Paraguay was recognized as an independent state by the\r\nArgentine Confederation in 1852, and by Great Britain in 1853. On\r\nNovember 11, 1864, hostilities between Paraguay and Brazil began, when a\r\nBrazilian steamer was captured as an intruder on Paraguayan waters; in\r\nthe same year Brazil was invaded by the Paraguayans, and on April 14,\r\n1865, Lopez (president of the republic) invaded the territories of the\r\nArgentine Republic, which immediately made alliance with Brazil. In\r\nSeptember, 1865, the army of Lopez was defeated. The war continued\r\nalmost without intermission until 1870, when Lopez was killed. Since\r\nthat time Paraguay, though nominally independent, has been almost\r\ncompletely under control of Brazil.\r\n\r\n=Parallels.= Are trenches cut in the ground before a fortress, roughly\r\nparallel to its defenses, for the purpose of giving cover to the\r\nbesiegers from the guns of the place. The parallels are usually three,\r\nwith zigzag trenches leading from one to another. The old rule used to\r\nbe to dig the first at 600 yards’ distance; but the improvements in\r\nartillery have rendered a greater distance necessary, and at Sebastopol\r\nthe allies made their first trench 2000 yards from the walls. The third\r\ntrench is very near to the besieged works, and from it saps and zigzag\r\napproaches are directed to the covert way. See SIEGE.\r\n\r\n=Paramount.= The highest in rank or order; the chief.\r\n\r\n=Parapets= (Ital. _parapetto_, “breastguard”). In fortifications, are\r\nbreastworks, walls, or bulwarks of earth, brick, wood, iron, stone, or\r\nother material. The battlement around a flat roof, or the railing of a\r\nbridge is also called a parapet. The parapets of field-works are always\r\nmade of earth, which is also largely used in permanent fortifications.\r\nEarth has great advantages for this purpose, being readily obtained,\r\neasily handled, and affords good cover on account of the absence of\r\nsplinters and flying fragments when struck by a shot. The presence of\r\nrock or large gravel in the earth is objectionable for this reason. Of\r\nthe different earths, sand, hard clay, tufa, etc., resist penetration\r\nbetter than rich soils. The profile of the parapet is determined by its\r\nlocation and purpose. The earth to form it is taken from the ditch,\r\nwhich is sometimes in front and sometimes in rear. In inclosed works, or\r\nworks built at leisure, the ditch is always on the outside, leaving the\r\nnatural surface for the parade. Works built hastily, or under fire, have\r\nthe ditch on the inside. In this way cover is more rapidly obtained.\r\nThis form of parapet is used in all the trenches in siege operations and\r\nthe temporary lines thrown up on the field of battle. The _command of a\r\nparapet_ is the height of the interior crest above the site. For\r\nisolated works the command should be at least 8 feet, as the chances of\r\na successful resistance increase with the command. The profile of a\r\nparapet is a section taken at right angles to its length. In infantry\r\nparapets the _banquette_ is the bank of earth in rear of the parapet,\r\non which the troops stand to deliver their fire. This is usually about 4\r\nfeet wide, and about 4 feet 3 inches below the interior crest. The\r\nheight of the banquette depends upon the command of the parapet. The\r\n_interior slope_ of the parapet, against which the soldier leans in\r\nfiring, has a slope of 3 on 1. To support the earth at this inclination\r\na revetment of sand-bags, fascines, gabions, sod, pisa, or plank, is\r\nused. The _superior slope_ of the parapet is usually 1 on 6. It should\r\nbe steep enough to give a fire just above the farther edge of the ditch,\r\nbut not so steep as to weaken the parapet. The _exterior slope_ is 1 on\r\n1, or the natural slope of the earth. If it is made steeper than this it\r\nwill be beaten down by the projectiles of the enemy; if less steep, it\r\nwill offer a less obstacle to open assault. The _berme_, or space\r\nbetween the foot of the exterior slope and the edge of the ditch, is\r\nobjectionable, in offering a breathing-place to the enemy in the\r\nassault, but it is usually necessary to prevent the weight of the\r\nparapet from crushing in the scarp. The dimensions of the ditch are\r\nregulated by the amount of earth necessary to form the parapet. The\r\nscarp and counterscarp are made as steep as the stiffness of the soil\r\nwill allow. As a general rule, the depth of the ditch should not be less\r\nthan 6 feet, and its width should not be less than 12. The greatest\r\nwidth is regulated by the superior scope of the parapet, the line of\r\nwhich produced should not pass below the crest of the counterscarp. In\r\nexcavating near a salient it will be found that more earth is furnished\r\nthan in re-enterings. On this account the width of the ditch is usually\r\nmade variable, being less at the salients than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of a parapet is the horizontal distance between the\r\ninterior and exterior crests. This thickness should be one-half greater\r\nthan the penetration of the projectiles it is designed to resist. As the\r\nrifled guns now in use have much greater penetration than the\r\nsmooth-bores of former times, a proportionate increase in the dimensions\r\nof parapets has become necessary. The parapets of semi-permanent\r\nfield-works are usually calculated to resist the fire of siege-guns;\r\nthose of permanent works to resist the most powerful ordnance in use.\r\nThe trenches so much used in modern times to cover operations of armies\r\nin the field are shallow ditches, with the earth thrown outwards.\r\n\r\n=Parasang.= A Persian military measure, sometimes assumed as a league,\r\nbut equal to about 4 English miles.\r\n\r\n=Parbuckle.= To hoist or lower by means of a parbuckle.\r\n\r\n=Parbuckles.= Are 4-inch ropes, 12 feet long, with a hook at one end and\r\na loop at the other. To parbuckle a gun, is to roll it in either\r\ndirection from the spot in which it rests. To do this, place the gun on\r\nskids, and if it is to be moved up or down a slope, two 4¹⁄₂-inch ropes\r\nare made fast to some place on the upper part of the slope, the ends\r\nare carried under the chase and breech of the gun respectively, round it\r\nand up the slope. If the running ends of these ropes are hauled upon,\r\nthe gun ascends; if eased off, it descends. If the ground is horizontal,\r\nhandspikes only are necessary to move the gun.\r\n\r\n=Parcourir= (_Fr._). In a military sense, to run over the ground during\r\nan action. This word is particularly applicable to those movements which\r\nare made by general officers, officers commanding brigades, etc., for\r\nthe purpose of encouraging their soldiers in the heat of an engagement.\r\n\r\n=Pardon and Mitigation of Sentences.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR,\r\n112.\r\n\r\n=Parga.= A town of European Turkey, eyalet of Yanina, stands on a rocky\r\npeninsula on the shore of the Mediterranean, and is defended by a\r\ncitadel which is nearly impregnable. It has played a part of some\r\nimportance in history since the beginning of the 15th century. It\r\nmaintained its independence, under the protection of Venice, from this\r\nperiod till the fall of the Venetian power in 1797, when it was for a\r\nshort time garrisoned by the French. Ali Pasha, the governor of Yanina,\r\nobtained command of it in 1800, and in 1814 besieged it, on account of\r\nthe inhabitants refusing to submit to his rule; and as the French would\r\nnot defend them, the inhabitants applied for aid to the British, who\r\ntook possession of the citadel. Parga was finally given up to Turkey by\r\nthe treaty of 1819; but the inhabitants, not wishing to come under the\r\nOttoman sway, migrated to the Ionian Islands, and the town was then\r\noccupied by the Turks.\r\n\r\n=Paris= (anc. _Lutetia Parisiorum_). The metropolis of France, and after\r\nLondon, the most populous city in Christendom, is situated on both sides\r\nof the Seine, and is surrounded by walls and a strong line of\r\nfortifications. When Cæsar conquered Gaul, he rebuilt Lutetia, which had\r\nbeen nearly destroyed through the obstinacy of the Celtic tribe who here\r\nhad their stronghold, and it rose to be a place of considerable\r\nimportance during the 500 years of Roman dominion. In the beginning of\r\nthe 5th century it suffered much from the northern hordes, and\r\nultimately fell into the hands of the Franks, headed by Clovis, who,\r\nhaving embraced Christianity, made it his residence in 508. In 845 the\r\ncity was ravaged by the Normans, and in 845 and 920 suffered from\r\nfamine; in 885 it was gallantly defended by the Count Eudes and the\r\nBishop Goslin against the Danes; in 1231 it was rebuilt; and in 1411-18\r\nsuffered by the factions of the Armagnacs and Burgundians; taken by the\r\nEnglish in 1420, and retaken by the French in 1436; on August 24, 1572,\r\nthe massacre of St. Bartholomew occurred; in 1589-90 Henry IV. vainly\r\nbesieged it, and he entered it in March, 1594; surrendered to the allies\r\non March 30, 1814. Paris was the scene of many revolutions from July,\r\n1830, to February 22, 1848. The following are the great treaties of\r\nParis: Between England, France, Spain, and Portugal, cession of Canada\r\nto Great Britain by France, and Florida by Spain, on February 10, 1763;\r\nbetween France and Sardinia; the latter ceding Savoy, May 15, 1796;\r\nFrance and Sweden, whereby Swedish Pomerania and the island of Rugen\r\nwere given up to the Swedes, who agreed to adopt the French prohibitory\r\nsystem against Great Britain, January 6, 1810; on April 11, 1814, Paris\r\ncapitulated, and Napoleon renounced the sovereignty of France; the\r\nconvention of Paris, between France and the allied powers, the\r\nboundaries of France to be the same as on the first day of January,\r\n1792; peace of Paris ratified by France and all the allies on May 14,\r\n1814; convention of St. Cloud, between Marshal Davoust, Wellington, and\r\nBlücher, for the surrender of Paris, July 3, 1815, and the allies\r\nentered it on July 6; treaty of Paris, between Great Britain, Austria,\r\nRussia, and Prussia, styling Napoleon the prisoner of those powers, and\r\nconfiding his safeguard to England on August 2, 1815; establishing the\r\nboundaries of France, and stipulating for the occupation of certain\r\nfortresses by foreign troops for three years, on November 20, same year,\r\nand the treaty of Paris, confirming the treaties of Chaumont and Vienna,\r\nsame day; treaty between Russia and Turkey, England, France, and\r\nSardinia, March 30, 1856; another between England and Persia, March 4,\r\n1857; the treaty between the European powers, Prussia, and Switzerland,\r\nrespecting Neufchâtel, May 26, 1857; and the convention between France\r\nand Italy for withdrawal of French troops from Rome, September 15, 1864.\r\nIn the late war with Prussia the armies of France having been defeated\r\nby the Germans, on August 7, 1870, Paris was declared in a state of\r\nsiege. On September 4, a republic was proclaimed and a “provisional\r\ngovernment of national defense” instituted under the presidency of Gen.\r\nTrochu. On September 20, Paris was invested by the Germans, and\r\ncommunication was kept up with the outer world by means of pigeons and\r\nballoon mails. On October 30, riot reigned in Paris, and the members of\r\nthe provisional government were arrested and held prisoners for several\r\nhours. On November 28, 300,000 troops supported by 700 field-pieces,\r\ndivided into three corps, were concentrated at points around the city\r\nunder Gen. Trochu as commander-in-chief. Early in January the\r\nbombardment was begun, and continued most of the month without serious\r\ninjury. The city, nearly reduced to starvation and threatened with\r\nintestine commotion, surrendered on January 28, with 1900 pieces of\r\nartillery, 180,000 prisoners, a forced contribution of 200,000,000\r\nfrancs having been levied by the enemy. The National Assembly having\r\nratified the preliminaries of peace on February 28, the German troops,\r\nwho, to the number of 30,000, had occupied a quarter of Paris, quietly\r\nwithdrew. The terms of peace proving distasteful to the populace, Paris\r\nwas soon plunged into political chaos, and sanguinary conflicts followed\r\nbetween the government of the Commune, or Red Republicans, and the\r\nVersailles government under the presidency of Thiers.\r\n\r\n=Park.= The space occupied by the animals, wagons, pontons, and\r\nmaterials of all kinds, whether of powder, ordnance stores, hospital\r\nstores, provisions, etc., of an army when brought together; as, a park\r\nof wagons; a park of artillery; a park of provisions; engineer park, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n=Park.= To bring together in a park, or compact body; as, to park the\r\nartillery, etc.\r\n\r\n=Parley.= An oral conference with an enemy. It takes place under a flag\r\nof truce, and usually at some spot--for the time neutral--between the\r\ntwo armies. _To beat a parley_, is to give a signal for such a\r\nconference by beat of drum or sound of trumpet.\r\n\r\n=Parma.= A kind of round buckler used by the velites in the Roman army.\r\nIt was 3 feet in diameter, made of wood and covered with leather. Its\r\nform was round, and its substance strong; but Servius on the Æneid, and\r\neven Virgil, say that it was a light piece of armor in comparison with\r\nthe clypeus, though larger than the pelta.\r\n\r\n=Parma.= A city of Italy, situated on a river of the same name, about 72\r\nmiles southeast of Milan. It is supposed to be of Etruscan origin, but\r\nis first mentioned as a Roman colony, having become of considerable\r\nimportance in the time of the republic. It took a prominent part against\r\nAntony in 43 B.C., and was in consequence taken by that general and\r\nplundered by his troops. Under Augustus it received a fresh colony, and\r\nit again rose to be one of the principal towns of this populous and\r\nflourishing part of Italy. In 377 a colony of Goths was settled in the\r\nterritory of Parma by order of Gratian; Attila devastated and plundered\r\nit; and it was taken by Narses in his wars against the Goths and their\r\nallies. In 1247, Frederick II. besieged it without success. It\r\nsubsequently became a prey to feudal lords, and afterwards fell into the\r\nhands of the popes. Parma is now part of the province of Æmilia, in the\r\nkingdom of Italy, to which it was annexed March 18, 1860.\r\n\r\n=Parma, Battles of.= An indecisive engagement took place at Parma, June\r\n29, 1734, between the confederated armies of England, France, and Spain\r\nand the Austrians; and on June 19, 1799, the French under Macdonald were\r\nrouted by the Russians under Suwarrow, with a loss of 4 generals and\r\n10,000 men.\r\n\r\n=Paroi= (_Fr._). A stout wooden frame having long, sharp-pointed stakes\r\ndriven into it horizontally; it is placed upon the parapet to oppose\r\nscaling parties.\r\n\r\n=Parole.= A watch-word differing from the countersign (which see) in\r\nthat it is only communicated to officers of guards, while the\r\ncountersign is given to all the members. The parole is usually the name\r\nof a person, generally a distinguished officer, while the countersign is\r\nthe name of a place, as of a battle-field. It is also the declaration\r\nmade on honor by an officer, in a case in which there is no more than\r\nhis sense of honor to restrain him from breaking his word. Thus, a\r\nprisoner of war may be released from actual prison on his parole that he\r\nwill not go beyond certain designated limits; or he may even be allowed\r\nto return to his own country on his parole not to fight again during the\r\nexisting war against his captors. To break _parole_ is accounted\r\ninfamous in all civilized nations, and an officer who has so far\r\nforgotten his position as a gentleman ceases to have any claim to the\r\ntreatment of an honorable man, nor can he expect quarter should he again\r\nfall into the hands of the enemy he has deceived.\r\n\r\n=Paros.= One of the larger islands of the Grecian archipelago, situated\r\nwest of Naxos. In ancient times, it is said to have been colonized by\r\nCretans, and was very wealthy and powerful. It submitted to the\r\nPersians; and after the battle of Marathon was assailed ineffectually by\r\nMiltiades, who received here the wound of which he soon after died.\r\nAfter the death of Xerxes, Paros came under the supremacy of Athens, and\r\nshared the fate of the other Cyclades.\r\n\r\n=Parrain= (_Fr._). In military orders, the person who introduces or\r\npresents a newly-elected knight. The term is also used to signify the\r\ncomrade who is selected by a soldier who is condemned to be shot to bind\r\nthe handkerchief over his eyes.\r\n\r\n=Parrott Gun.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Parrott Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Parry.= To ward off; to stop or to put or turn off; to prevent; as, to\r\nparry a thrust, a blow, or the like, or anything that means or threatens\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n=Parry.= A defensive movement in sword and bayonet exercises; also a\r\ncommand; as, _tierce parry_, _quarte parry_, etc.\r\n\r\n=Parrying.= The action of warding off the push or blow aimed at one by\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n=Parsees=, or =Guebres=. The followers of Zerdusht, dwelt in Persia till\r\n638, when, at the battle of Kadseah, their army was decimated by the\r\nArabs, and the monarchy annihilated at the battle of Náhárand in 641.\r\nMany submitted to the conquerors (and their descendants are termed\r\nGuebres), but others fled to India, and their descendants still reside\r\nat Bombay (where they are termed Parsees), where they numbered 114,698\r\nin 1849.\r\n\r\n=Parsons Gun.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Parsonstown= (anc. _Birr_). A considerable inland town on the river\r\nBrosna, in King’s Co., Ireland, 69 miles west-southwest from Dublin.\r\nBirr was the scene of many important events, both in the Irish and in\r\nthe post-invasion period. The castle, which was anciently the seat of\r\nthe O’Carrols, was granted by Henry II. to Philip de Worcester; but it\r\nfrequently changed masters, and even alternated between English and\r\nIrish hands. Through the entire period of the civil wars it was\r\nconstantly disputed, until after 1690, when the Parsons family was\r\nfinally established in possession of the castle and adjoining lands.\r\nParsonstown is a large military station.\r\n\r\n=Partheniæ.= A word derived from the Greek, signifying children born of\r\nunmarried women. The name was applied to a particular class of citizens\r\nin Sparta after the Messenian war, whose origin was ascribed to the\r\nfollowing circumstances: The Spartans having been at war with the\r\nMessenians for twenty years, and having by that means very much\r\ndepopulated their country, and apprehending that if the war continued it\r\nmight eventually strip Sparta of all its male inhabitants, they sent\r\nsome of their young men from the army into the city, with license to be\r\nfamiliar with as many unmarried women as they would; and the children\r\nbegotten by them in this manner were called _partheniæ_, on account of\r\nthe uncertainty as to who were their fathers. At the end of the war,\r\nthis brood were deemed bastards, and were denied the bearing of any\r\noffice in the government, etc. This unjust exclusion enraged them so\r\nmuch that they conspired with the slaves to destroy all the nobility;\r\nbut, on the discovery of their plot, they were driven out of the city;\r\nafter which, being headed by Phalantus, a bold and enterprising son of\r\nchance, they traveled into Magna Grecia in Italy, and built Tarentum.\r\n\r\n=Parthenopean Republic.= Was the name given to the state into which the\r\nkingdom of Naples was transformed by the French republicans, January 23,\r\n1799, and which only lasted till the following June, when the invading\r\narmy was forced to retreat.\r\n\r\n=Parthia.= Anciently a country of Western Asia, lying at the southeast\r\nend of the Caspian Sea, from which it was separated by a narrow strip,\r\nknown as Hyrcania, now forms the northern portion of Khorassan, and is\r\nan almost wholly mountainous region. The original inhabitants are\r\nbelieved to have been of Scythian race, as shown by their language as\r\nwell as by their manners, and to belong to the great Indo-Germanic\r\nfamily. The Parthians, during the time of the Roman republic, were\r\ndistinguished by primitive simplicity of life and extreme bravery,\r\nthough, at the same time, much given to bacchanalian and voluptuous\r\npleasures. They neglected agriculture and commerce, devoting their whole\r\ntime to predatory expeditions and warfare. They fought on horseback, and\r\nafter a peculiar fashion. Being armed solely with bows and arrows, they\r\nwere rendered defenseless after the first discharge, and, to gain time\r\nfor adjusting a second arrow to the bow, turned their horses, and\r\nretired, as if in full flight; but an enemy incautiously pursuing was\r\nimmediately assailed by a second flight of arrows; a second pretended\r\nflight followed, and the conflict was thus carried on till the Parthians\r\ngained the victory, or exhausted their quivers. They generally\r\ndischarged their arrows backwards, holding the bow behind the shoulder;\r\na mode of attack more dangerous to a pursuing enemy than to one in order\r\nof battle. The Parthians first appeared in history as subject to the\r\ngreat Persian empire. After the death of Alexander the Great, Parthia\r\nformed part of the Syrian kingdom, but revolted under Antiochus II., and\r\nconstituted itself into an independent kingdom under the _Arsacidæ_, 250\r\nB.C., a race of kings who exercised the most completely despotic\r\nauthority ever known. The Parthian dominion rapidly became a most\r\npowerful and flourishing empire. In spite of repeated attacks on the\r\npart of the Romans, the Parthians maintained their independence; and\r\nthough Trajan, in 115-116, seized certain portions of the country, the\r\nRomans were soon compelled to abandon them. In 214, during the reign of\r\nArtabanus IV., the last of the Arsacidæ, a revolt headed by Ardshir, son\r\nof Babegan, broke out in Persia, and the Parthian monarch, beaten in\r\nthree engagements, lost his throne and life, while the victor\r\nsubstituted the Persian dynasty of the Sassanidæ for that of the\r\nArsacidæ. Some scions of the Parthian royal family continued for several\r\ncenturies to rule over the mountainous district of Armenia, under the\r\nprotection of the Romans, and made frequent descents upon Assyria and\r\nBabylonia.\r\n\r\n=Partiality.= An unequal state of judgment or leaning in favor of one of\r\ntwo parties. Every member of a court-martial is sworn to do justice,\r\nwithout partiality, favor, or affection. A previous opinion expressed by\r\na member, before the court is sworn, is deemed a good and sufficient\r\ncause of challenge by either the prisoner or prosecutor, and the\r\nindividual cannot sit on the trial and judgment of the case.\r\n\r\n=Partisan.= The name given to small corps detached from the main body of\r\nan army, and acting independently against the enemy. In partisan warfare\r\nmuch liberty is allowed to partisans. Continually annoying the flanks\r\nand rear of columns, they intercept convoys, cut off communications,\r\nattack detachments, and endeavor to spread terror everywhere. This kind\r\nof warfare is advantageously pursued only in mountainous or\r\nthickly-wooded districts. In an open country, cavalry very readily\r\ndestroys partisans. The Spanish race make active partisans. The party is\r\ncalled _guerrilla_, the partisan a _guerrillero_.\r\n\r\n=Partisan.= A term formerly applied to a pike or halbert.\r\n\r\n=Partition Lines.= In heraldry, lines dividing the shield in directions\r\ncorresponding to the ordinaries. According to the direction of the\r\npartition lines, a shield is said to be party or parted per fess, per\r\npale, per bend, per chevron, per saltire; a shield divided by lines in\r\nthe direction of a cross is said to be quartered; and a shield parted at\r\nonce per cross and per saltire is said to be gironné of eight. The\r\npartition lines are not always plain; they may be engrailed, invected,\r\nembattled, wavy, nebuly, indented, dancetté, or raguly.\r\n\r\n=Partridges.= In artillery, were very large bombards, formerly in use at\r\nsieges and in defensive works.\r\n\r\n=Parts, Bridges By.= See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Party.= A small detachment of men, horse or foot, sent upon any kind of\r\nduty; as, into an enemy’s country, to pillage, to take prisoners, and\r\noblige the country to come under contribution.\r\n\r\n=Party.= In heraldry, parted or divided;--used with reference to any\r\ndivision of a field or charge.\r\n\r\n=Party, Firing.= Are those who are selected to fire over the grave of\r\nany one interred with military honors.\r\n\r\n=Party, Recruiting.= Is a certain number of men, under an officer or\r\nnon-commissioned officer, detached from their respective regiments for\r\nthe purpose of enlisting men.\r\n\r\n=Party, Working.= See WORKING PARTY.\r\n\r\n=Pas de Sours= (_Fr._). Steps leading from the bottom to the top of a\r\nditch in permanent fortification.\r\n\r\n=Pasha=, or =Bashaw= (from the Persian _padishah_, “powerful ruler”). A\r\ntitle applied in the Ottoman empire to governors of provinces, or\r\nmilitary and naval commanders of high rank. The distinctive badge of a\r\npasha is a horse-tail, waving from the end of a staff crowned with a\r\ngilt ball; in war, this badge is always carried before him when he goes\r\nabroad, and is at other times planted in front of his tent. There are\r\nthree grades of pashas, which are distinguished by the number of\r\nhorse-tails on their standards; those of the highest rank are pashas of\r\nthree tails, and include, in general, the highest functionaries, civil\r\nand military. All pashas of this class have the title of vizier. The\r\npashas of two tails are the governors of provinces, who are generally\r\ncalled by the simple title “pasha.” The pashas of one tail, the lowest\r\nrank of pashas, are provincial governors. See HORSE-TAIL.\r\n\r\n=Pass.= A straight, difficult, and narrow passage, which, well defended,\r\nshuts up the entrance to a country.\r\n\r\n=Pass.= A certificate of leave of absence given to a soldier for a short\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n=Pass of Arms.= In ancient chivalry, a bridge, road, etc., which the\r\nknights undertook to defend, and which was not to be passed without\r\nfighting the person who kept it. He who was disposed to dispute the pass\r\ntouched one of the armories of the other knight who held the pass, that\r\nwere hung on pales, columns, etc., erected for the purpose; and this was\r\na challenge which the other was obliged to accept. The vanquished gave\r\nthe conqueror such prize as was agreed on.\r\n\r\n=Pass, To.= Is to march in review by open order of columns, for the\r\npurpose of saluting.\r\n\r\n=Passable.= Capable of being passed, traveled, traversed, or the like;\r\nas, the roads are not passable for troops.\r\n\r\n=Passade=, or =Passado=. In fencing, a push or thrust; also, a sudden\r\nmovement to the front.\r\n\r\n=Passage.= A pass or encounter; as, a passage at arms.\r\n\r\n=Passage of Ditches.= In siege operations the passage of a dry ditch\r\nconsists in the _descent_ (which is by a blindage, if the ditch is not\r\ntoo deep, or a blindage and gallery for deep ditches) and a full sap,\r\nwhich leads from the outlet of the _descent_ to the bottom of the\r\nbreach. The passage of a wet ditch is more difficult, and specially\r\nperilous if the besieged can produce sudden freshets by flood-gates or\r\nother contrivance. The method usually followed is to build a dike or\r\nbridge of fascines and hurdles across the ditch. The abutment for this\r\nbridge is formed by excavating a grand gallery behind the counterscarp\r\nand throwing the earth taken from it into the ditch through the outlet\r\nof the _descent_. The dike is carried forward from this abutment by\r\nsappers, who work on a raft carrying a musket-proof mask on the side of\r\nthe enemy. A gabionade parapet on the exposed side of the dike serves to\r\nprotect the men in bringing forward the fascines, hurdles, etc., to\r\nextend the dike.\r\n\r\n=Passage of Rivers.= The passage is effected by surprise or by main\r\nforce, and detachments are thrown by one means or the other upon the\r\nenemy’s bank of the river before proceeding to the construction of\r\nbridges. The passage by force ought always to be favored by diversions\r\nupon other points. Infantry cross bridges without keeping step. Cavalry\r\ndismount in crossing, leading their horses.

The\r\ntown is chiefly noteworthy for the treaty which was signed here by\r\nPrince Eugène and the grand viziers, July 21, 1718. By this treaty,\r\nwhich put an end to the war undertaken by the Turks against Venice in\r\n1714 for the conquest of the Morea, a truce of twenty-five years was\r\nestablished, and the Banat of Temesvars, the western portion of\r\nWallachia and Servia, the town and territory of Belgrade, and a part of\r\nBosnia, were secured to the house of Austria.\r\n\r\n=Passau.= A picturesque, fortified, frontier town of Bavaria, at the\r\nconfluence of the Inn and the Ilz with the Danube, 90 miles\r\neast-northeast from Munich. Fort Oberhaus, on the left bank of the\r\nDanube, stands on steep wooded cliffs, at an elevation of upwards of 400\r\nfeet, and commands the passage of both the Inn and Danube, besides which\r\nthe town is further defended by the castle of Niederhause, and by ten\r\ndetached forts. The treaty whereby religious freedom was established,\r\nwas ratified here between the emperor Charles V. and the Protestant\r\nprinces of Germany, July 31, 1552.\r\n\r\n=Pass-box.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Passegardes.= In ancient armor, were ridges on the shoulder-pieces to\r\nturn the blow of a lance.\r\n\r\n=Passe-Mur.= An ancient 16-pounder gun, 18 feet long, weighing 4200\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n=Passes-Balles= (_Fr._). Boards or machines made of iron or brass, used\r\nin disparting cannon, and fitted to every species of caliber.\r\n\r\n=Passion Cross.= A cross of the form on which our Saviour suffered, with\r\na long stem and a short traverse near the top. It is of occasional\r\noccurrence as a heraldic charge, though less frequent than many other\r\nvarieties of cross. A passion cross, when elevated on three steps or\r\ndegrees (which have been said by heralds to represent the virtues of\r\nFaith, Hope, and Charity), is called a Cross Calvary.\r\n\r\n=Passive Operations.= Are operations the object of which is solely to\r\nrepel an attack of the enemy and thus prevent his advance.\r\n\r\n=Pass-parole.= An order passed from front to rear of an army by word of\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n=Passport.= A document given by the competent officer of a state, which\r\npermits the person therein named to pass or travel from place to place\r\nby land or water.

An ancient town of the Veneti in\r\nthe north of Italy, on the Medoacus Minor, and on the road from Mutina\r\nto Altinum. In 302 B.C. it was powerful enough to drive back the Spartan\r\nking Cleomenes with great loss when he attempted to plunder the\r\nsurrounding country. It was plundered by Attila; and in consequence of a\r\nrevolt of its citizens, it was subsequently destroyed by Agilolf, king\r\nof the Longobards, and razed to the ground.\r\n\r\n=Patay.= A town of France, department of Loiret, 14 miles northwest of\r\nOrleans, where John of Arc, the Maid of Orleans, was present, when the\r\nEarl of Richemont signally defeated the English, June 18, 1429. Talbot\r\nwas taken prisoner, and the valiant Fastolfe was forced to fly. In\r\nconsequence, Charles VII. of France entered Rheims in triumph, and was\r\ncrowned July 17, following year, Joan of Arc assisting in the ceremony\r\nin full armor, and holding the sword of state.\r\n\r\n=Patched-up Peace, The.= In French history, the name given to a treaty\r\nof peace between the Duke of Orleans and John of Burgundy, in 1409.\r\n\r\n=Paté= (_Fr._). In fortification, a sort of horseshoe, that is, a\r\nplatform or terre-plein, irregularly built, yet generally constructed in\r\nan oval form. It is surrounded by a parapet, without anything to flank\r\nit, and having no other defense than what is front or fore right.\r\n_Patés_ are usually erected in marshy grounds to cover the gate of a\r\nfortified town or place. Also an iron or earthen pot filled with powder\r\nand grenades for throwing against besiegers; some were used at Lille in\r\n1708.\r\n\r\n=Patereros.= Were small pieces of ordnance, now obsolete, worked on\r\nswivels; most commonly used on board of ships, where they were mounted\r\non the gunwale, and discharged showers of old nails, etc., into hostile\r\nboats. The French called them Pierriers, from loading them with stones.\r\n\r\n=Patience.= The power or faculty of suffering; endurance; the power of\r\nexpecting long, without rage or discontent; the power of supporting\r\nfaults or injuries, without revenge; long suffering. In military life,\r\npatience is an essential requisite. Without patience half the toils of\r\nwar would be insupportable; with patience there are scarcely any\r\nhardships but what coolness, courage, and ability may overcome. It is\r\none of the greatest virtues, indeed, in an officer or soldier patiently\r\nto support, not only the rigor of discipline, but the keen and vexatious\r\ncircumstances of disappointment.\r\n\r\n=Patna=, or =Pattana=. A town of British India, capital of a district of\r\nthe same name, in the presidency of Bengal, on the right bank of the\r\nGanges, 10 miles east of Dinapore, and 377 miles northwest of Calcutta.\r\nFactories were established here at an early period by the British. In\r\n1763 disputes began to arise between Meer Cossim, the nawaub of Bengal\r\nand Behar, and the servants of the East India Company, about the transit\r\ndues levied on native traders, from which the English claimed exemption.\r\nThe nawaub for some time refused to accede to these demands; but finally\r\nhe abolished all the imposts, both on British and native goods, a step\r\nwhich was not desired by the Company, and which must have greatly\r\ndiminished his revenues. In revenge for this injury, he proceeded in\r\nvarious ways to annoy the British; and at length went so far as to seize\r\nsome of their boats on the Ganges. On this Mr. Ellis, the chief of the\r\nfactory at Patna, made an attack on the city and took possession of it,\r\nalthough Meer Cossim soon afterwards recovered it, and forced the\r\nBritish to take refuge in the factory. For four months hostilities\r\ncontinued between the two parties, in the course of which the nawaub was\r\nseveral times defeated, until he became so exasperated at the loss of\r\nthe city of Monghyr, that he ordered the murder in cold blood of 200\r\nprisoners. On November 6, in the same year, Patna was taken by the\r\nBritish; and in May, 1764, Meer Cossim’s troops were totally defeated\r\nunder the walls. Since that time the place has remained undisturbed in\r\nthe hands of the British.\r\n\r\n=Patomemeter.= An instrument for measuring the force of currents.\r\n\r\n=Patonce, Cross.= In heraldry (Lat. _patens_, “expanding”), a cross with\r\nits terminations expanding like early vegetation or an opening blossom.\r\n\r\n=Patoo-patoo.= A formidable weapon with sharp edges, used by the\r\nPolynesian Islanders and New Zealanders as a sort of battle-axe to\r\ncleave the skulls of their enemies.\r\n\r\n=Patræ= (now _Patras_). One of the twelve cities of Achaia, was situated\r\nwest of Rhium, near the opening of the Corinthian Gulf. The town was\r\nchiefly of importance as the place from which the Peloponnesians\r\ndirected their attacks against the opposite coast of Ætolia. Patræ was\r\none of the four towns which took the leading part in founding the second\r\nAchæan League. Patræ assisted the Ætolians against the Gauls in 279 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Patriarchal Cross.= A cross which, like the patriarchal crosier, has\r\nits upright part crossed by two horizontal bars, the upper shorter than\r\nthe lower. A cross patriarchal fimbriated or was a badge of the Knights\r\nTemplar.\r\n\r\n=Patrick, St., Order of.= A national order of knighthood for Ireland,\r\nestablished by George III. on February 5, 1783, and enlarged in 1833. As\r\noriginally constituted, it consisted of the sovereign, the grand master\r\n(who was always the lord-lieutenant of Ireland for the time being), and\r\n15 knights. By the statutes of 1833 the number of knights was increased\r\nto 22. The collar of the order (of gold) is composed of roses\r\nalternating with harps, tied together with a knot of gold, the roses\r\nbeing enameled alternately white within red, and red within white, and\r\nin the centre is an imperial crown surmounting a harp of gold, from\r\nwhich the badge is suspended. The _badge_ or _jewel_ is of gold, and\r\noval; surrounding it is a wreath of shamrock proper on a gold field;\r\nwithin this is a band of sky-blue enamel charged with the motto of the\r\norder, _Quis Separabit_ MDCCLXXXIII. in gold letters; and within this\r\nhand a saltire gules (the cross of St. Patrick) surmounted by a shamrock\r\nor trefoil slipped vert, having on each of its leaves an imperial crown\r\nor. The field of the cross is either argent or pierced, and left open. A\r\nsky-blue _ribbon_, worn over the right shoulder, sustains the badge when\r\nthe collar is not worn. The _star_, worn on the left side, differs from\r\nthe badge only in being circular in place of oval, and in substituting\r\nfor the exterior wreath of shamrocks eight rays of silver, four rays of\r\nwhich are larger than the other four. The _mantle_ is of rich sky-blue\r\ntabinet, lined with white silk, and fastened by a cordon of blue silk\r\nand gold with tassels. On the right shoulder is the _hood_, of the same\r\nmaterials as the _mantle_. The order is indicated by the initials K.P.\r\n\r\n=Patriot.= A sincere and unbiased friend to his country; an advocate for\r\ngeneral civilization, uniting in his conduct through life, moral\r\nrectitude with political integrity. Such a character is seldom found in\r\nany country; but the specious appearance of it is to be seen everywhere,\r\nmost especially in Europe. It is difficult to say how far the term can\r\nbe used in a military sense, although it is not uncommon to read of a\r\ncitizen soldier, and a _patriot_ soldier. Individually considered the\r\nterm may be just, but it is hardly to be understood collectively.\r\n\r\n=Patrol.= To go the rounds in a camp or garrison; to march about and\r\nobserve what passes as a guard. To pass round as a sentinel; as, to\r\npatrol the city.\r\n\r\n=Patrolling.= Performing the duties of a patrol.\r\n\r\n=Patrols.= A patrol is a detachment which is employed to obtain\r\ninformation respecting the enemy’s movements and position, and relating\r\nto the nature of the country over which the army has to move, and to\r\nkeep open the communications between the different portions of a\r\ncommand. Patrols are generally composed entirely of cavalry, although\r\nthey are sometimes composed of infantry and cavalry; and in very much\r\nbroken and obstructed ground, it might be necessary that they contain\r\nonly infantry.\r\n\r\n=Patte= (_Fr._). A term used in mining; when a well or excavation is\r\nmade in loose or crumbling earth, and it becomes necessary to frame it\r\nin, the rafters must be laid horizontally to support the boards in\r\nproportion as the workmen gain depth. The ends of the rafters that are\r\nfirst laid run 10 or 12 inches beyond the border of the well, for the\r\npurpose of sustaining the platform. These supports are called\r\n_oreilles_; consequently, that every frame may be supported the second\r\nis attached or made firm to the first by means of the ends of boards\r\nwhich are nailed together. In this manner the third is joined to the\r\nsecond, and the fourth to the third. These ends are called _pattes_, or\r\nhandles.\r\n\r\n=Pattée, Cross=, or =Cross Formeé= (Lat. _patulus_, “spreading”). In\r\nheraldry, a cross with its arms expanding towards the ends, and flat at\r\ntheir outer edges.\r\n\r\n=Patte d’Oie= (_Fr._). A term used in mining to describe three small\r\nbranches which are run out at the extremity of a gallery. They are so\r\ncalled from their resemblance to the foot of a goose.\r\n\r\n=Pattern Regiment.= A phrase of distinction which is applied to a corps\r\nof officers and soldiers who are remarkable for their observance of good\r\norder and discipline.\r\n\r\n=Paulus Hook.= A point on the Jersey shore which ran into the Hudson\r\nRiver near where the Pavonia ferries now are. The first settlement was\r\nmade here in 1633. A British fort erected at this point was taken on the\r\nmorning of August 19, 1779, by the Americans under Maj. Harry Lee, who\r\nmade a descent on it by way of the Point of Rocks, and captured 179\r\nprisoners, a number of guns, and a quantity of stores.\r\n\r\n=Pavade.= Formerly a short dagger was so called in Scotland.\r\n\r\n=Pavecheur=, or =Pavesier=. An ancient militia who carried the\r\n(_pavois_) shield.\r\n\r\n=Pavia= (anc. _Ticinum_). A city of Northern Italy, capital of the\r\nprovince of the same name, on the left bank of the Ticino, 20 miles\r\nsouth of Milan, and 3 miles above the confluence of the Ticino and the\r\nPo. Pavia was founded by the Ligurii; it was sacked by Brennus and by\r\nHannibal; burned by the Huns; conquered by the Romans, and became a\r\nplace of considerable importance at the end of the Roman empire. Then it\r\ncame into the possession of the Goths and Lombards, and the kings of the\r\nlatter made it the capital of the kingdom of Italy. It became\r\nindependent in the 12th century, then, weakened by civil wars, it was\r\nconquered by Matthew Visconti in 1345. Since that period, its history is\r\nmerged in that of the conquerors of Lombardy. Here, in 1525, the French\r\nwere defeated by the Imperialists, and their king taken prisoner; but in\r\n1527, and again in the following year it was taken and laid waste by the\r\nFrench. It was stormed and pillaged by Napoleon in 1796, and came into\r\nthe possession of Austria by the peace of 1814. Since 1859 it has been\r\nincluded within the reorganized kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Pavilion.= A tent raised on posts; a flag, colors, ensign, or banner;\r\nin heraldry, a covering in form of a tent, investing the armories of\r\nkings.\r\n\r\n=Pavilion, To.= To furnish or cover with tents; to shelter with a tent.\r\n\r\n=Pavise= (written also _Pavais_, _Pavese_, and _Pavesse_).

Their numbers have been greatly\r\nreduced, owing to their wars with the Sioux, with whom they maintained a\r\nhereditary warfare. They now number about 2000 souls, and are divided in\r\nfour bands.\r\n\r\n=Pay.= Is the stipend or salary allowed for each individual serving in\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\n=Pay Bills.= In the British service, accounts regularly tendered by\r\ncaptains of troops or companies of the money required by them for the\r\neffectives of such troop or company.\r\n\r\n=Pay, Colonial.= In the British service is a certain allowance which is\r\nmade to troops serving in the colonies.\r\n\r\n=Pay Department.= Is that department of a government which takes charge\r\nof all matters relating to the pay of the army.

Under the direction of\r\nthe Secretary of War, the paymaster-general assigns paymasters to\r\ndistricts; he receives from the treasurer all the moneys which are\r\nintrusted to him for the purpose of paying the pay, the arrears of pay,\r\netc., appertaining to the army. He is also charged with all necessary\r\ninstructions to his subordinates in reference to the supply and\r\ndistribution of funds for the payment of the army, and all other things\r\nappertaining to the financial duties of his department and the\r\naccountability of its officers. In these and all other matters having\r\nrelation specially to the internal administration of the pay department,\r\nthe correspondence and orders is direct between the paymaster-general\r\nand his subordinates, and between the department and district chiefs and\r\ntheir subordinates.\r\n\r\n=Paymasters.= Are officers appointed in the army for the purpose of\r\nkeeping its pay accounts, and the disbursing of moneys in payment of\r\ntroops. In the U. S. service it is the duty of paymasters to pay all the\r\nregular and other troops; and to insure punctuality and responsibility,\r\ncorrect reports shall be made to the paymaster-general once in two\r\nmonths, showing the disposition of the funds previously transmitted,\r\nwith accurate estimates for the next payment of such regiment, garrison,\r\nor department, as may be assigned to each. In the British service a\r\npaymaster is attached to each regiment.\r\n\r\n=Paymaster-Sergeant.= In the English army, a non-commissioned officer\r\nwho assists the paymaster.\r\n\r\n=Pay-roll.= A roll or list of persons entitled to payment, with the sums\r\nwhich are to be paid on them.

When the\r\npaymaster’s rolls have been computed and returned to the company for\r\nexamination and signature, the calculations thereon will be transcribed\r\non the triplicate muster- and pay-roll, under the direction of or by the\r\ncompany commander, who is responsible for the correct performance of\r\nthis duty.\r\n\r\n=Pay-Sergeant.= In the British service, a sergeant who, on the\r\nresponsibility of the captain of a troop, battery, or company, keeps the\r\nmen’s accounts. He is generally, but not invariably, the color-sergeant\r\nin the infantry, or the troop or battery sergeant-major in the cavalry\r\nor artillery.\r\n\r\n=Pea Ridge.= A range of hills in Benton Co., Ark., which gives its name\r\nto the battle fought here March 6-8, 1862, between the Union forces\r\nunder Gen. Curtis and the Confederates under Van Dorn, in which the\r\nlatter were defeated with loss of over 2500 killed, wounded, and\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\n=Peabody-Martini Rifle.= A breech-loading rifle invented by an\r\nAmerican--Peabody--and improved by a Swiss. It is called _Martini-Henry_\r\nin England, in which country it is the official arm. More than half a\r\nmillion of these rifles were manufactured for the Turkish government\r\nduring the late Russo-Turkish war by the Providence Tool Company of\r\nRhode Island. The gun has a great reputation on account of its long\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n=Peace.= Freedom from war, exemption from, or cessation of, hostilities.\r\nThis condition of affairs is effected and maintained by treaties between\r\nindependent powers.\r\n\r\n=Peace Establishment.= The reduced number of effective men in the army\r\nduring a period of peace.\r\n\r\n=Peal.= A long sound, or a succession of long sounds, as of cannon, etc.\r\n\r\n=Pean= (Old Fr. _pannes_, “furs”). One of the furs borne in heraldry,\r\ndiffering from ermine only in the tinctures,--the ground being sable and\r\nthe spots of gold.\r\n\r\n=Pea-rifle.= A rifle of small bore carrying a ball of the size of a pea.\r\n\r\n=Peasants’ War.= In German history, the name given to that great\r\ninsurrection of the peasantry which broke out in the beginning of the\r\nyear 1525. The oppression of the peasants had gradually increased in\r\nseverity, as the nobility became more extravagant and the clergy more\r\nsensual and degenerate. The example of Switzerland encouraged the hope\r\nof success, and from 1476 to 1517 there were risings here and there\r\namong the peasants of the south of Germany. A peasant rebellion, called\r\nfrom its cognizance, the _Bundschuh_ (laced shoe), took place in the\r\nRhine countries in 1502, and another called the “League of Poor Conrad,”\r\nin Würtemberg, in 1514, both of which were put down without any\r\nabatement of the grievances which occasioned them. The Reformation, by\r\nthe mental awakening which it produced, and the diffusion of sentiments\r\nfavorable to freedom, must be reckoned among the causes of the great\r\ninsurrection itself. The Anabaptists, and in particular Münzer,\r\nencouraged and excited them, and a peasant insurrection took place in\r\nthe Hegau in 1522. Another known as the “Latin War” arose in 1523 in\r\nSalzburg, against an unpopular archbishop, but these were quickly\r\nsuppressed. On January 1, 1525, the peasantry of the abbacy of Kempten,\r\nalong with the towns-people, suddenly assailed and plundered the\r\nconvent; this event proved the signal for a general rising of the\r\npeasantry on all sides throughout the south of Germany. They organized\r\nthemselves into bands of from 9000 to 30,000, and destroyed convents and\r\ncastles, murdered, pillaged, and were guilty of the greatest excesses,\r\nwhich must indeed be regarded as partly in revenge for the cruelties\r\npracticed against them. In May and June, 1525, they sustained a number\r\nof severe defeats from the regular forces under Truchsess von Waldburg,\r\nin which large bodies of them were destroyed. The landgraf Philip of\r\nHesse was also successful against them in the north of Germany. The\r\npeasants after they had been subjugated were everywhere treated with\r\nterrible cruelty; a great body of them were massacred; multitudes were\r\nhanged in the streets, and many were put to death with the greatest\r\ntortures. It is supposed that more than 150,000 persons lost their lives\r\nin this war. The lot of the defeated insurgents became harder than ever.\r\n\r\n=Pebble Powder.= See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Pecq, Le.= A village of France, on the right bank of the Seine, about\r\nhalf a mile east from St. Germain en Laye. The allied forces crossed the\r\nSeine at this spot in 1815.\r\n\r\n=Pectoral= (Fr. _pectorale_). A breastplate. Among the Romans the poorer\r\nsoldiers, who were rated under 1000 drachmas, instead of the _lorica_,\r\nor brigantine (a leathern coat of mail) wore a pectoral, or breastplate\r\nof thin brass, about twelve fingers square. Some modern troops, such as\r\nthe cuirassiers, etc., wear pectorals for the direct purposes of defense\r\nand bodily protection; but in general small ornamental plates with\r\nclasps have been substituted.\r\n\r\n=Peculation.= A term used in a military sense for embezzling public\r\nmoneys, stores, arms, or ammunition. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 60.\r\n\r\n=Pedro.= An early gun of large caliber for throwing stone balls.\r\n\r\n=Peel.= To strip; to plunder; to pillage; as, to peel a province or\r\nconquered people.\r\n\r\n=Peel.= A small tower or fort.\r\n\r\n=Peel-house.= A small fortified place.\r\n\r\n=Peel-towers.= The name given to the towers erected on the Scottish\r\nborders for defense. They are square, with turrets at the angles, and\r\nthe door is sometimes at a height from the ground. The lower story is\r\nusually vaulted, and forms a stable for horses, cattle, etc.\r\n\r\n=Peep o’ Day Boys.= Were insurgents in Ireland, who visited the houses\r\nof their antagonists at break of day, in search of arms. They first\r\nappeared July 4, 1784, and for a long period were the terror of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n=Pegu.= A British province of Eastern India, is bounded on the north by\r\nthe Burmese empire, east by the Tenasserim provinces, south by the Gulf\r\nof Martaban, and west by the Bay of Bengal and the province of Arracan.\r\nIt was discovered by the Portuguese in 1520. The early history of Pegu\r\nconsists of little more than a narrative of barbarous and cruel contests\r\nbetween that country and the kingdom of Ava, in which the latter was\r\nfinally successful, and reduced Pegu to a province of that kingdom, or,\r\nas it is generally called, the Burman empire. Pegu, the capital, was\r\ntaken by Maj. Cotton, with 300 men, in June, 1852, without loss; and\r\nafterwards abandoned. It was again occupied by the Burmese and strongly\r\nfortified, with a garrison of 4000 men. It was recaptured by Gen. Godwin\r\nwith 1200 men and 2 guns, in two hours, with the loss of 6 killed and 32\r\nwounded. The province was annexed to the British possessions, by\r\nproclamation, December 20, 1852, and has since prospered. In February,\r\n1862, it was united with Arracan and Tenasserim as British Burmah.\r\n\r\n=Pei-ho.= A river of China, which rising on the confines of Tartary,\r\ntraverses the northern part of the province of Chih-le or Pe-chih-le,\r\nand falls into the Gulf of Pe-chih-le, in about 38° 30′ N. lat. The\r\nattack on the escort of the British and French ambassadors whilst\r\nascending the Pei-ho to Pekin (June, 1859), led to the war with China of\r\n1860, in which year the Taku forts on this river were taken by the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\n=Peishwa.= The title of the military governor of the Mahrattas, whose\r\noffice became hereditary in the family of Balajee Biswanath, its first\r\npossessor, who fixed his residence at Poonah.\r\n\r\n=Peking=, or =Pekin=. The capital of the Chinese empire, situated\r\nbetween the Pei-ho and Hoen-ho, 100 miles northwest from the mouth of\r\nthe Pei-ho River. About 5 miles north from the city the famous\r\nYuen-ming-yuen palaces are situated, which were sacked and destroyed by\r\nthe allies in October, 1860; these were 30 in number. Here had been\r\nheaped up for centuries all the movable riches and presents of the\r\nemperors of China. At the approach of the allies Hien-fung fled in\r\nhaste; and when Lord Elgin learned that it was in those grounds that the\r\nBritish and French prisoners, captured by treachery, had been tortured,\r\nhe gave the order to sack and destroy this favorite residence of the\r\nemperor’s, as it could not fail to be a blow to his pride as well as his\r\nfeelings; and it became a solemn act of retribution. Peking has thus\r\nbeen rendered memorable by this march of the British and French forces\r\n(1860) to the walls of the city, on which the British and French flags\r\nwere raised. The provisions of the treaty of Tien-tsin (1858) were\r\nsubsequently ratified and supplemented by the convention of Peking,\r\nwhich was signed in the English and French languages at Peking, October\r\n24, 1860.\r\n\r\n=Pelican.= An ancient name for a 6-pounder culverin, 9 feet long and\r\nweighing 2400 pounds.\r\n\r\n=Pelican.= In heraldry, the pelican is drawn with her wings endorsed,\r\nand wounding her breast with her beak. When represented in her nest\r\nfeeding her young with her blood, she is called a pelican in _her\r\npiety_.\r\n\r\n=Peligni.= A brave and warlike people of Sabine origin, in Central\r\nItaly, bounded southeast by the Marsi, north by the Marrucini, south by\r\nSamium and the Frentani, and east by the Frentani likewise. They offered\r\na brave resistance to the Romans, but concluded a peace with the\r\nrepublic along with their neighbors the Marsi, Marrucini, and Frentani,\r\nin 304 B.C. They took an active part in the Social war (90, 89). They\r\nwere subdued by Pompeius Strabo, after which time they are rarely\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n=Pelinna=, or more commonly =Pelinnæum= (now _Gardhiki_). A town of\r\nThessaly, in Hestiæotis, on the left bank of the Peneus, was taken by\r\nthe Romans in their war with Antiochus.\r\n\r\n=Pellene.= A city in Achaia, bordering on Sicyonia, the most easterly of\r\nthe twelve Achæan cities, was situated on a hill 60 stadia from the sea,\r\nand was strongly fortified. Its port-town was Aristonautæ. In the\r\nPeloponnesian war Pellene sided with Sparta. In the later wars of Greece\r\nbetween the Achæan and Ætolian leagues, the town was several times taken\r\nby the contending parties.\r\n\r\n=Pellet.= An old word for shot or bullet.\r\n\r\n=Pellet=, or =Ogress=. In English heraldry, a roundle sable.\r\n\r\n=Pell-mell.= In utter confusion; with disorderly mixture; with confused\r\nviolence; as, the battle was a confused heap, the ground unequal, men,\r\nhorses, chariots, crowded pell-mell.\r\n\r\n=Peloponnesian War.= One of the most celebrated and important of the\r\nwars carried on between the different states of Greece; the particulars\r\nof which are related in the writings of Xenophon and Thucydides. It\r\nexisted for twenty-seven years, during which time the Athenians and the\r\ninhabitants of the Peloponnesus, the most southern peninsula of Greece,\r\nwere the principal belligerents. After the Athenians had sustained\r\nimmense losses, it was at best agreed that to establish the peace the\r\nfortifications of the Athenian harbors should be demolished, and all\r\ntheir ships, except twelve, be surrendered to the enemy. They were to\r\nresign every pretension to their dominions abroad; to follow the\r\nSpartans in war, and in time of peace to frame their constitutions\r\naccording to the will and prescription of their Peloponnesian\r\nconquerors. Their walls and fortifications were instantly leveled to the\r\nground; and the conquerors observed that in the demolition of Athens,\r\nsucceeding ages would fix the era of Grecian freedom. This memorable\r\nevent happened about 404 years before the Christian era; and thirty\r\n“tyrants” were appointed by Lysander over the government of the city.\r\n\r\n=Pelta.= A small light shield, sometimes attributed to the Amazons, but\r\nused by numerous nations of antiquity, such as the inhabitants of\r\nThrace, Spain, and Mauritania, before its general introduction among the\r\nGreeks. It consisted mainly of a frame of wood or wicker-work covered\r\nwith skin or leather, without the metallic rim, and of a great variety\r\nof shapes. It was sometimes round, as in the special case of the\r\n_cetra_, sometimes elliptical, sometimes variously situated round the\r\nrim, sometimes even quadrangular, but most commonly crescent-shaped or\r\nlunated, as alluded to in the “_Amazonidum lunatis agmina peltis_” of\r\nVirgil. Soldiers bearing the _pelta_ were called _peltastæ_.\r\n\r\n=Pelusium.= The Greek name of an ancient Egyptian city situated on the\r\nnortheastern angle of the Delta, and important as the key of Egypt on\r\nthe Asiatic side. Pelusium is called _Sin_ in the Old Testament. It\r\nfirst figures in semi-authentic history as the scene of Sennacherib’s\r\ndefeat, when (according to the Egyptian tradition, as reported by\r\nHerodotus) the camp of the Assyrians was invaded at night by a host of\r\nfield-mice, who gnawed their bow-strings and shield-straps, so that in\r\nthe morning, when the Egyptians fell upon them, they were defenseless.\r\nIn 525 B.C., Cambyses overthrew, near Pelusium, the forces of\r\nPharaoh-Psammetichus. It surrendered to Alexander in 333 B.C. The city\r\nwas also taken by the Persians in 309 B.C.; and in 173 B.C., it was the\r\nscene of the defeat of Ptolemy Philometor by Antiochus Epiphanes. Mark\r\nAntony captured it 55 B.C., and it opened its gates to Octavian after\r\nhis victory at Actium, 31 B.C. It was taken after a protracted\r\nresistance by Amrou, the Saracen, in 618.\r\n\r\n=Pembroke.= A seaport town of South Wales, on a navigable creek of\r\nMilford Haven, 210 miles west of London. In 1648 its castle was\r\nbeleaguered by Cromwell, and taken after a siege of six weeks.\r\n\r\n=Penalba=, or =Penalva=. A village of Spain, province of Huesca, 18\r\nmiles northwest of Mequinenza. During the War of the Succession the\r\ntroops of Philip V. were here defeated in a bloody battle by the army of\r\nthe Archduke Charles, August 15, 1710.\r\n\r\n=Penalty.= In a military sense, signifies forfeiture for\r\nnon-performance, likewise punishment for embezzlement, etc.\r\n\r\n=Pencel.= A small flag or streamer which was formerly carried at the top\r\nof a lance;--called also _pennoncel_.\r\n\r\n=Pend d’Oreilles=, or =Kalispels= (_Calispels_). A tribe of partially\r\ncivilized Indians, divided into several bands aggregating about 2000,\r\nwho reside in Washington, Idaho, and Montana Territories. A few of this\r\ntribe are also to be found in British Columbia.\r\n\r\n=Pendant.= In heraldry, a part hanging from the label, resembling the\r\ndrops in the Doric frieze.\r\n\r\n=Pendulum, Ballistic.= See BALLISTIC PENDULUM.\r\n\r\n=Pendulum Hausse.= See HAUSSE, PENDULUM.\r\n\r\n=Penetrating.= Having the power of entering or piercing another body.\r\n\r\n=Penetration of Spherical Projectiles.= Their penetration when of the\r\nsame size, with different velocities or charges, is nearly as the\r\nsquares of the velocities; when of different sizes the penetration will\r\nbe proportionate to their diameters multiplied by the density, and\r\ninversely as the tenacity of the medium. The depth of penetration of a\r\nprojectile fired from field-pieces at the distance of 500 or 600 yards,\r\nis from 4¹⁄₂ to 6 feet in parapets recently constructed, and will\r\ntraverse walls of ordinary construction; but a 12-pounder is necessary\r\nto make a breach in walls of good masonry and of 4 feet in thickness,\r\nand in this case the position of the battery must be favorable, and the\r\noperation a slow one. The depth of penetration of projectiles fired from\r\nthe 4¹⁄₂-inch siege-gun, is about the same as that of projectiles fired\r\nfrom the 30-pounder Parrott gun, namely, 12 feet. Sand, sandy earth\r\nmixed with gravel, small stones, chalk, and tufa, resist shot better\r\nthan the productive earths. Shells may be considered as round shot of a\r\nlower specific gravity, and their penetrations are therefore\r\nproportionally less. A bank of earth, to afford a secure cover from\r\nheavy guns, will require a thickness from 18 to 24 feet. In guns below\r\n18-pounders, if the number of the feet in thickness of the bank be made\r\nequal to the number of pounds in the weight of the shot by which it is\r\nto be assailed, the requisite protection will be obtained. Earth\r\npossesses advantages over every other material. It is easily obtained,\r\nregains its position after displacement, and the injury done to an\r\nearthen battery by day can be readily repaired at night. Where masonry\r\nis liable to be breached, it should be covered with earth. Wrought-iron\r\nplates 4¹⁄₂ inches in thickness will withstand the effects of 32-pound\r\nshots, and of all inferior calibers at short ranges, as 400 yards.\r\nPlates of this thickness, however, are soon destroyed by 68-pound shots,\r\nand afford little protection from the elongated shots of the new rifled\r\nordnance. To resist successfully the fall of heavy shells, buildings\r\nmust be covered with arches of good masonry, not less than 3 feet thick,\r\nhaving bearings not greater than 25 feet, and these must be again\r\nprotected by a covering of several feet of earth. Iron plates half an\r\ninch thick, oak planks 4 inches thick, or a 9-inch brick wall, are\r\nproof against musketry or canister at a range of 100 yards. Iron plates\r\n1 inch thick, oak from 8 to 10 inches thick, a good wall a foot thick or\r\na firm bank of earth 4 feet thick, will afford secure cover from\r\ngrape-shot, from any but the largest guns at short ranges. The common\r\nmusket will drive its bullet about a foot and a half into well-rammed\r\nearth, or it will penetrate from 6 to 10 half-inch elm boards placed at\r\nintervals of an inch. The penetration of the rifled musket is about\r\ntwice that of the common musket. A rope matting or mantlet 3¹⁄₂ inches\r\nthick is found to resist small-arm projectiles at all distances; it may\r\ntherefore be employed as a screen against riflemen.\r\n\r\n=Peninsular War.= A war which had for its theatre the kingdoms of Spain\r\nand Portugal, and in which England, Spain, and Portugal fought against\r\nFrance. It lasted from March, 1808, until May, 1814, when the former\r\npowers were completely victorious.\r\n\r\n=Pennetière=, or =Panetière= (_Fr._). A pocket or small bag in which\r\nslingers carried stones and leaden balls.\r\n\r\n=Pennon= (_Fr._). Formerly a copper wing of a long, light arrow\r\n(_vireton_), substituted for a feather.\r\n\r\n=Pennon.= In former times was something like a banner, but with the\r\naddition of a triangular point, charged with arms, and borne before\r\nknights-bachelors.\r\n\r\n=Pennsylvania.= One of the Middle States of the Atlantic slope, the\r\nsecond in population in the Union, and one of the thirteen of the\r\noriginal confederacy. The earliest settlements were made in 1627 by a\r\ncolony of Swedes and Finns, who established themselves on the Delaware\r\nRiver, going as far northward as the locality of Philadelphia. In 1665 a\r\nDutch expedition from New Amsterdam took formal possession of the\r\ncountry. The Dutch in their turn were superseded by the English after\r\nthe capture of New York in 1664; and in 1681 the territory was granted\r\nby Charles II. to William Penn, who with his co-religionists of the\r\nSociety of Friends established a Christian government “founded on peace,\r\nreason, and right.” Having purchased the lands of the Indians, and\r\nconciliated them by kindness and good will, he secured their friendship\r\nduring seventy years. Previous to the French and Indian war in 1755, the\r\ncontests waged between the French and English colonists had not reached\r\nPennsylvania; but in that year occurred the disastrous defeat of\r\nBraddock, near Pittsburgh, in which Washington, then a young man,\r\ndistinguished himself. Pennsylvania took an active part in the\r\nRevolutionary contest, and on her soil occurred the battles of\r\nBrandywine and Germantown, September and October, 1777, the massacres of\r\nWyoming and Paoli, and the suffering winter encampment at Valley Forge\r\nin 1777-78. The most prosperous of the colonies, and in a central\r\nposition, it became the seat of the congress held by the colonies both\r\nbefore and after the decision of the struggle. Independence was\r\nproclaimed here, and it remained the seat of the general government\r\nuntil 1800. No State in the confederacy has been more loyal to the\r\nConstitution. During the war of 1812 she promptly furnished her quota of\r\ntroops, and during the civil war she sent nearly 400,000 men into the\r\nfield. During this trying period her territory was three times invaded:\r\nin 1862, when Chambersburg (which see) was captured, and in 1864, when\r\nit was burned; and in 1863, when it was invaded by Lee, and the battle\r\nof Gettysburg fought on its soil.\r\n\r\n=Penobscots.= A tribe of Indians, of Algonkin stock (numbering about\r\n500), who reside on an island in the Penobscot River, about 8 miles\r\nnorth of Bangor, Me. They were allies of the colonists in the war of the\r\nRevolution, and received for their services a large tract of land, the\r\ngreater part of which has been from time to time disposed of.\r\n\r\n=Penon de Velez.= A fortified town, built on a high and steep rock,\r\nlying off the north coast of Morocco, 75 miles southeast from Ceuta. It\r\nbelongs to Spain, and was founded by Pedro of Navarre in 1508. It was\r\ntaken by the Moors in 1522; but recovered by the Spaniards in 1664.\r\n\r\n=Penrith.= A town of England, county of Cumberland, 282 miles\r\nnorth-northwest of London. On a knoll to the west of the town stand the\r\nruins of a castle, which was built by the Nevilles during the wars of\r\nthe Roses, and dismantled in the civil war by the Parliamentary party.\r\nThe town is a place of considerable antiquity, and it formerly played a\r\nconspicuous part in the border warfare. It was taken by the Scots\r\nseveral times in the 14th century, and in 1715 and 1745 was occupied by\r\nthe insurgents.\r\n\r\n=Pensacola.= City and capital of Escambia Co., Fla., situated on the\r\nwest shore of Pensacola Bay, about 10 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, has\r\nan excellent harbor, and is one of the safest in the Gulf. Pensacola was\r\nsettled by the Spaniards, occupied by the British in 1814, and acquired\r\nby the United States in 1821. It contains a navy-yard, and is defended\r\nby Forts Pickens and McRae. During the civil war, 1861-65, it was the\r\nscene of several military and naval operations. The navy-yard was\r\nsurrendered to the Confederates in 1861, but was recovered by the Union\r\nforces in the following year.\r\n\r\n=Pension.= Specifically, a stated allowance to a person in consideration\r\nof past services; payment made to one retired from service, for age,\r\ndisability, or other cause; especially a yearly stipend paid by\r\ngovernment to retired officers, disabled soldiers, the families of\r\nsoldiers killed, etc.\r\n\r\n=Pensioner.= In the British army, is a soldier maintained in Chelsea\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n=Pensioner, Out-.= In the British army, is a soldier receiving a\r\npension, but not maintained in Chelsea Hospital. Those who are capable\r\nof bearing arms are available for military service when required.\r\n\r\n=Pensioners, Gentlemen.= See GENTLEMEN-AT-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Penstock.= A machine composed of timber, which, by means of a movable\r\nboard, enables the defenders of a fortress to allow such a rush of water\r\nfrom the batardeaux as to inundate and destroy the works which the enemy\r\nmay have constructed in the ditch.\r\n\r\n=Pentagon.= In fortification, a figure bounded by five sides, which form\r\nso many angles, capable of being fortified with an equal number of\r\nbastions. It also denotes a fort with five bastions.\r\n\r\n=Pentathlon.= The five exercises performed in the Grecian games, namely,\r\nleaping, running, quoiting, darting, and wrestling.\r\n\r\n=Penthouse.= A shed hanging forward in a sloping direction from the main\r\nwall of a place.\r\n\r\n=Pentland Hills.= A range of hills in Scotland, commencing about 4 miles\r\nwest from Edinburgh. Here the Scotch Presbyterians, since called\r\nCameronians, who had risen against the government, on account of the\r\nestablishment of Episcopacy, were defeated by the royal troops, November\r\n28, 1666.\r\n\r\n=Pentri.= One of the most important of the tribes in Samnium; were\r\nconquered by the Romans along with the other Samnites, and were the only\r\none of the Samnite tribes who remained faithful to the Romans when the\r\nrest of the nation revolted to Hannibal in the second Punic war.\r\n\r\n=Peons.= East Indian municipal foot-soldiers. These men are chiefly\r\nemployed to assist in collecting the revenues, and carry a pike or\r\nstaff. Most persons in India keep servants, who wear a belt with their\r\nmaster’s name on it. These are called _peadahs_.\r\n\r\n=Peoria Indians.= A tribe of aborigines who formerly resided in\r\nIllinois, but are now settled on the Quapaw agency, in Indian Territory,\r\nin confederation with the Kaskaskias and other tribes. They are but few\r\nin number, the northern tribes having nearly exterminated them in 1769,\r\nin revenge for the murder of Pontiac.\r\n\r\n=Pequots=, or =Pequods=. A tribe of Indians of Algonkin stock, closely\r\nallied to the Mohegans, who resided in Eastern Connecticut. The tribe\r\nwas nearly exterminated by the colonists in the Pequot war (1637).\r\n\r\n=Perclose=, or =Demi-Garter=. In heraldry, the lower half of a garter\r\nwith the buckle.\r\n\r\n=Percussion.= Is the impression which a body makes in falling or\r\nstriking against another, or the shock of two moving bodies. It is\r\neither direct or oblique.\r\n\r\n=Percussion, Centre of.= That point wherein the shock of the percutient\r\nbodies is the greatest.\r\n\r\n=Percussion, Direct.= Is where the impulse is given in the direction of\r\na right line perpendicular to the point of contact.\r\n\r\n=Percussion, Oblique.= Is where the impulse is given in the direction of\r\na line oblique to the point of contact.\r\n\r\n=Percussion-bullet.= A bullet made by placing a small quantity of\r\npercussion powder in a copper envelope in the point of an ordinary\r\nrifled-musket bullet.\r\n\r\n=Percussion-caps.= See CAPS, PERCUSSION-.\r\n\r\n=Percussion-fuze.= See FUZE.\r\n\r\n=Percussion-lock.= A lock of a gun in which gunpowder is exploded by\r\nfire obtained from the percussion of fulminating powder.\r\n\r\n=Percussion-match.= A match which ignites by percussion.\r\n\r\n=Percussion-powder.= Powder composed of such materials as to ignite by\r\nslight percussion; fulminating powder.\r\n\r\n=Percutient.= That which strikes or has power to strike.\r\n\r\n=Perdu.= A word adopted from the French, signifying to lie flat and\r\nclosely in wait. It likewise means employed on desperate purposes;\r\naccustomed to desperate enterprises.\r\n\r\n=Pered= (Hungary). Here the Hungarians under Görgey were defeated by\r\nWohlgemuth and the Russians, June 21, 1849.\r\n\r\n=Perekop.= An isthmus 5 miles broad, connecting the Crimea with the\r\nmainland. It was called by the Tartars Orkapou, “gate of the Isthmus,”\r\nwhich the Russians changed to its present name, which signifies a barren\r\nditch. The Tartar fortress of the same name, which was situated on this\r\nisthmus, was taken and destroyed by the Russian marshal Münich in 1736,\r\nby assault, although it was defended by 1000 Janissaries and 100,000\r\nTartars. It was again strongly fortified by the khan, but was again\r\ntaken by the Russians in 1771, who have since retained it.\r\n\r\n=Peremptory.= Whatever is absolute and final, not to be altered,\r\nrenewed, or restrained. _Peremptory execution_, what takes place\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n=Perfidious.= Treacherous; false to trust; guilty of violated faith;\r\nhence a perfidious foe. War, however melancholy in its effects, and\r\nfrequently unjustifiable in its cause and progress, is nevertheless,\r\namong civilized nations, so far governed by certain principles of honor\r\nas to render the observance of established laws and customs an object of\r\ngeneral acquiescence. When two or more countries are engaged in a\r\nhostile contest, whatever belligerent party grossly deviates from those\r\nrules is deservedly stamped with infamy, and justly called a\r\n_perfidious_ foe.\r\n\r\n=Perfidy.= Want of faith; treachery.\r\n\r\n=Perforated Cake Powder.= See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Périgueux.= A town of France, capital of the department of Dordogne,\r\n296 miles south-southwest from Paris. Périgueux occupies the site of the\r\nancient Vesunna, which was at the time of the Roman invasion the capital\r\nof the Petrocorii. Under the empire, it was a place of no small\r\nimportance, as it stood at the junction of five roads, and was strongly\r\nfortified. It was ceded, along with Aquitaine, to the English by Louis\r\nIX. After having been recovered by the French, the town was again lost;\r\nbut it was finally taken from the English by Charles V. During the civil\r\nwars of the Reformation, it was a stronghold of the Protestants till the\r\nyear 1581; and it was not till 1653 that it came into the power of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n=Peril.= Instant or impending danger; risk; hazard; jeopardy; exposure\r\nto injury, loss, or destruction.\r\n\r\n=Peril.= To expose to danger; to hazard; to risk, etc.\r\n\r\n=Perim.= A small island belonging to Great Britain, situated in the\r\nstrait of Bab-el-Mandeb, at the entrance to the Red Sea, about 1 mile\r\ndistant from the Arabian, and about 13 miles from the African coast. On\r\nits southwest side is an excellent harbor, capable of accommodating 40\r\nmen-of-war. Fortifications have been erected on the island, and the guns\r\ncommand the strait on both sides. It was first occupied by the English\r\nin 1799, and held by them as a check upon the designs of the French, who\r\nwere then in Egypt. It was abandoned in 1801, but was reoccupied by\r\nGreat Britain in February, 1857, with a view to the protection of her\r\nIndian possessions, which were thought to be exposed to some chance of\r\ndanger from the opening of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\n=Perjury.= False swearing; the act or crime of willfully making a false\r\noath, when lawfully administered; or the crime committed when a lawful\r\noath is administered, in some judicial proceeding, to a person who\r\nswears willfully, absolutely, and falsely in a matter material to the\r\nissue. For punishment of persons convicted of perjury, see APPENDIX,\r\nARTICLES OF WAR, 60 and 62.\r\n\r\n=Perkernucka.= Petty officers are so called in India.\r\n\r\n=Perm.= A government of Russia, situated partly in Russia in Europe and\r\npartly in Russia in Asia. It was invaded and ruined by the Mongols in\r\nthe 13th century.\r\n\r\n=Permanent Fortification.= See FORTIFICATION.\r\n\r\n=Permanent Rank.= A rank in the military service which does not cease\r\nwith any particular service, or locality of circumstances; in opposition\r\nto local or temporary rank.\r\n\r\n=Péronne.= A town of France, in the department of Somme, 30 miles east\r\nof Amiens. Louis XI. of France, having placed himself in the power of\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy, was forced to sign the treaty of Péronne,\r\nconfirming those of Arras and Conflans, with several humiliating\r\nstipulations, October 14, 1468. Louis XI. had promised Champagne and\r\nBrié as appanages to his brother Charles, duke of Berry, not intending\r\nto keep his word, apprehending that those provinces, being so near\r\nBurgundy, would prove a fresh source of broils and disputes. Péronne was\r\na place of much importance in the Middle Ages, and bore the name of _La\r\nPucelle_ (“The Maiden City”), as it was never captured till Wellington\r\ntook it eight days after the battle of Waterloo.\r\n\r\n=Perpendicular Direction.= In the march of a line, is the direction at\r\nright angles to the line which each man should take in a direct movement\r\nto the front. Without the strictest attention is paid to this essential\r\nprinciple in all movements, the greatest irregularity, and ultimately\r\nthe greatest confusion, must ensue. Perpendicular and parallel movements\r\nconstitute, indeed, the whole system of good marching. When several\r\ncolumns, divisions, or companies advance, the lines and directions of\r\nmarching must be strictly perpendicular and parallel to each other,\r\notherwise the distance will be lost, and the ultimate object of forming\r\na correct line must be defeated.\r\n\r\n=Perpendicular Fortification.= Owes its origin to the Marquis de\r\nMontalembert, a distinguished French general, who published his works\r\nupon the subject in 1776. Vauban had, it was admitted, rendered the art\r\nof attack superior to that of defense. Montalembert strove to reverse\r\nthis relation, and in his endeavors, rejected entirely the bastion\r\nsystem of the older engineers. Instead of the occasional bastions, with\r\nintervening curtains, with which they surrounded their _enceinte_, he\r\nbroke the whole polygon into salient and re-entering angles, the latter\r\nbeing generally at right angles. Before the connected redans thus formed\r\nwere counterguards of low elevation and ravelins, to which the\r\napproaches were through casemated _caponnieres_. In the salient angle of\r\neach redan he built a brick tower, 40 feet in diameter, twelve-sided,\r\nand four stories high. The second and third tiers were built for heavy\r\nguns, and the upper loop-holed for musketry. In the centre of the tower\r\nwas a circular _reduit_, intended as a last refuge for the garrison.\r\nMontalembert maintained that from these towers every possible approach\r\ncould be commanded, which to a great extent is true; but it must be also\r\nremembered that the greater space a gun commands, by so much the more is\r\nit raised above the plain, and rendered visible. These towers would have\r\nlittle chance against the rifled ordnance of the present day.\r\nMontalembert’s system was violently attacked by the French engineers,\r\nbut Carnot subsequently adopted it, with some modifications, and it\r\nenters largely into the modern German defensive works. The system has\r\nnever, however, found favor with British engineers.\r\n\r\n=Perpendicular, Gunner’s.= See GUNNER’S LEVEL.\r\n\r\n=Perpignan.= A town of France, in the department of the Eastern\r\nPyrenees, situated on the Tet, 35 miles from Narbonne. It commands the\r\npassage by the Eastern Pyrenees from Spain into France, and is defended\r\non the south by a citadel and by ramparts flanked with bastions, and\r\nprotected by raised works. Perpignan now ranks as one of the first\r\nstrongholds in France. In 1474 the town was taken by Louis XI. of\r\nFrance, but having been restored to Spain, it was again taken by Louis\r\nXIII. in 1642, and, along with the province of Roussillon, finally ceded\r\nto France by the treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. In 1793 a battle was\r\nfought in its neighborhood between the Spaniards and the French, in\r\nwhich the former were defeated.\r\n\r\n=Perrhæbi.= A powerful and warlike Pelasgis people, who, according to\r\nStrabo, migrated from Eubœa to the mainland, and settled in the\r\ndistricts of Hestiætos and Pelasgiotis in Thessaly. The Perrhæbi were\r\nmembers of the Amphictyonic League. At an early period they were subdued\r\nby the Lapithæ; at the time of the Peloponnesian war they were subject\r\nto the Thessalians, and subsequently to Philip of Macedon; but at the\r\ntime of the Roman wars in Greece they appear independent of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n=Perrières.= A kind of short mortars formerly much used for throwing\r\nstone shot.\r\n\r\n=Persepolis.= An ancient city, the capital of Persia at the time of the\r\ninvasion of Alexander the Great, and the seat of the chief palaces of\r\nthe Persian kings. The city is said to have been burned by Alexander,\r\nand is not subsequently mentioned in history except in the second book\r\nof the Maccabees, where it is stated that Antiochus Epiphanes made a\r\nfruitless effort to plunder its temples. In the later times of the\r\nMohammedan rule, the fortress of _Istakhr_ seems to have occupied the\r\nplace of Persepolis.\r\n\r\n=Persia= (Per. _Iran_). A country of Asia, which may be considered as\r\nthe most opulent and powerful of any that lie to the west of India; it\r\nis bounded on the west by Turkey in Asia, north by Caucasus, the Caspian\r\nSea, and Asiatic Russia, east by Afghanistan and Beloochistan, and south\r\nby the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. The Persians, as a nation, first\r\nrose into notice on the ruins of the great empires founded on the\r\nEuphrates. Babylon was taken by Cyrus in 638 B.C., and soon after he\r\nextended it more widely than any that had been previously established in\r\nthe world. It comprised, on one side, the west of India, and on the\r\nother, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt; and the valor, indeed, with which\r\nthe Greeks defended their small territory, alone prevented him from\r\nannexing a considerable part of Europe to his domains. After a feeble\r\nstruggle, it succumbed to the brave and disciplined armies of Alexander,\r\nwho won the entire empire of Darius Codomanus for his own by force of\r\narms, in 331. After his death, his immense possessions were divided\r\namong his generals; but Greeks and Greek sovereigns continued during\r\nseveral centuries to reign over Western Asia. About 2 B.C. Artaxerxes\r\nfounded the monarchy of the Parthians; and in 3 A.D. the dynasty of the\r\nSassanidæ arose, who restored the name, with the religion and laws, of\r\nancient Persia. They were overthrown by the Mohammedan invaders, who\r\nsuffered in their turn from the successive invasions of the country by\r\nthe descendants of Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, and the Turks, who entirely\r\nchanged the aspect of Western Asia. At length, in 1501, a native dynasty\r\nagain arose, under Ismael Shah, who placed himself on the throne. After\r\nthe reign of Abbas the Great, who died in 1628, the princes of the Safi\r\ndynasty became enervated by luxury and dissipation, and Persia, in the\r\nbeginning of the last century, was overrun by the Afghans, who carried\r\nfire and sword throughout the whole country, and reduced its proudest\r\ncapitals to ashes. The atrocities of the Afghans were avenged, and the\r\nindependence of Persia vindicated, by Nadir Shah; but though the\r\nvictories of this daring chief threw a lustre on his country, it was\r\nalmost torn to pieces after his death by civil war, till the fortune of\r\narms gave a decided superiority to Kerim Khan. His death gave rise to\r\nanother disputed succession, with civil wars as furious as before. At\r\nlength Aga-Mohammed, a eunuch, raised himself in 1795 by crimes and\r\ndaring to the sovereignty, and not only held it during his lifetime, but\r\ntransmitted it to his nephew, who assumed the title of Feth Ali Shah,\r\nand subdued the rebellious tribes in Khorassan, but was dragged into a\r\nwar with Russia, in which he lost the power of Derbend and several\r\ndistricts on the Kur. In 1848, Nasr-ed-Din, the great-grandson of Feth\r\nAli, succeeded to the throne, and in consequence of the capture of Herat\r\nby the Persians in 1856, war was declared against them by Great Britain.\r\nBushire was occupied, and the Persian troops were twice defeated by Gen.\r\nOutram at Kooshab and Mohammerah in the following year. These victories\r\nwere followed by the conclusion of a treaty of peace, April, 1857, and\r\nthe evacuation of Herat by the Persians in the month of July.\r\n\r\n=Personnel= (_Fr._). All the officers and men, military and civil,\r\ncomposing an army, or any part of one, as opposed to _matériel_.\r\n\r\n=Personnel of a Battery.= All officers and men necessary for the\r\nmanœuvre, management, and care of a battery.\r\n\r\n=Perspective.= Is the art of drawing the resemblance of objects on a\r\nplane surface, as the objects themselves appear to the eye, etc.\r\n\r\n=Perth.= The principal town of Perthshire, and formerly the metropolis\r\nof Scotland, situated on the Tay, which is crossed here by a fine stone\r\nbridge, 33 miles from Edinburgh. It is one of the most ancient towns of\r\nScotland. It is a generally received opinion that Perth was built and\r\nfortified by Agricola, who erected a citadel to maintain his conquests,\r\nand check the wild spirit of the savage natives. In 1298, after the\r\nbattle of Falkirk, Edward I. fortified Perth and rebuilt the walls in\r\nthe strongest manner. The worthy burgesses of this town seem to have\r\nbeen men of mettle in those days, and on various occasions sallying\r\nforth from behind their walls, set fire to the castles of their haughty\r\nneighbors, when the latter had forbidden their vassals to carry\r\nprovisions to the city. In the year 1311, Robert Bruce laid siege to the\r\ntown, but was obliged to withdraw his troops, after various unsuccessful\r\nattempts to take it; but subsequently, choosing a dark night, he led a\r\nselected band of determined men against it, scaled the walls, and\r\ncarried the town sword in hand, the king himself being the second man\r\nwho entered the place. About the beginning of the 14th century, the\r\nfamous combat between the Clan Chattan and the Clan Quhele, or Clan Kay,\r\ntook place on the North Inch, and was decided in favor of the former,\r\npartly by the bravery of a citizen or burgess called Harry Wind, whom\r\nthe chief of the Clan Chattan had engaged on the spot to supply the\r\nplace of one of his men who had failed to appear. In 1544, the regent,\r\nat the instigation of Cardinal Bethune, turned Lord Ruthven, provost of\r\nthe town, out of his office, and conferred it upon Chartres of Kinfauns.\r\nThe citizens, however, resisted the attempt, and repulsed, in a smart\r\nskirmish, the cardinal’s nominee, who came to enter upon his duties at\r\nthe head of an armed force. In 1559, after a riotous insurrection,\r\nduring which the Catholic churches were demolished, the queen determined\r\nto inflict the severest vengeance on the Reformers. Both parties took\r\nthe field; negotiations ensued; Perth was thrown open to the queen, and\r\noccupied by a French garrison. Relief from the insolence and exactions\r\nof the garrison was only obtained after a regular siege by the\r\nReformers. On June 26, Lord Ruthven attacked the town on the west, and\r\nProvost Halyburton of Dundee fired into it from the bridge, and speedily\r\nobliged the garrison to capitulate. Subsequently, Argyle, and Stewart,\r\nprior of St. Andrews, marched out of Perth with 300 citizens, resolved\r\nto prosecute the Reformation, or perish in the attempt. The people\r\njoined them everywhere as they proceeded, and before they reached\r\nStirling their numbers had increased to 5000. The gates of Stirling and\r\nevery other town in their way were thrown open to receive them. They,\r\nwithout violence, took possession of Edinburgh, cast the images out of\r\nits churches, and placed in them ministers of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n=Peru.= A republic of South America, formed out of the former Spanish\r\nviceroyalty of the same name. The first information received of the\r\ncountry by the Spaniards was obtained from a young cacique in the\r\nneighborhood of the Isthmus of Darien about the year 1511. In 1513,\r\nVasco Nuñez de Balboa crossed the mountains which separated the two\r\noceans, and took possession of the Pacific in the name of the king of\r\nCastile. He extended his discoveries many leagues southward, but appears\r\nnot to have reached the territory of Peru. In 1525, Francisco Pizarro, a\r\nsoldier of mean birth but of daring spirit, who had accompanied Balboa\r\nin the previous expedition, embarking at Panama with about 100 men,\r\nlanded in Peru, and spent three years in exploring the country. Having\r\nreturned to Spain with presents of gold and jewels for the king, he was\r\nsent out with orders to effect the conquest of the newly-discovered\r\ncountry. Recrossing the ocean with 180 men and 27 horses, he again set\r\nsail from Panama, and receiving some further reinforcements at Puerto\r\nViejo and Puna, now considered himself in a fit position to enter upon\r\nthe proper scene of his labors. He accordingly crossed over to Tumbez,\r\nand there learned that the country had for some time been distracted by\r\na civil war between Huascar and Atahuallpa, two sons of the late inca.\r\nPizarro saw at once the importance to him and his cause of this state of\r\nthe country. After some time spent in reconnoitring, he fixed upon a\r\nfertile spot in the rich valley of Tangarala as a site for a settlement.\r\nHere he established a town which he called San Miguel. On September 24,\r\n1532, leaving 50 men as a guard for this new settlement, he started out\r\nwith 167 men, 67 of whom were cavalry, to meet the inca Atahuallpa, who\r\nnow victorious over his brother was encamped with his army about ten or\r\ntwelve days’ journey off. His force was everywhere received with\r\nkindness; an envoy from the inca was sent with presents to meet and\r\ninvite him to an interview at Caxamarca. The Spaniards arrived here\r\nNovember 15, 1532, and treacherously prepared to use the unsuspecting\r\nkindness of the Peruvians as the means of their destruction. When at the\r\nappointed time the inca accompanied by his nobles and retinue was\r\nproceeding to the place of interview, he and his followers were assailed\r\nby the Spaniards who were concealed in the neighboring buildings,\r\nthousands of the unsuspecting and unarmed natives were slain, and\r\nAtahuallpa himself taken prisoner. An immense ransom was offered for\r\nhim; it was accepted by Pizarro, who, however, basely refused to give up\r\nhis prisoner, but after a mockery of a trial put him to death. For many\r\nyears the country was in a state of war and anarchy, resulting finally\r\nin Pizarro becoming master of Peru in 1546, and it became a viceroyalty\r\nof Spain. In its subsequent history there is matter of little interest\r\ntill the war of independence, which was proclaimed in 1821 by Gen. San\r\nMartin, and successfully terminated by Bolivar, who, after a succession\r\nof engagements, the most notable of which was that of Ayacucho (which\r\nsee), finally drove the Spaniards from Callao, their last stronghold,\r\nJuly 29, 1826. The country has since on several occasions been the scene\r\nof those insurrections to which the states of Spanish America have been\r\nsubject. In 1879 war was proclaimed between Peru and Chili, which has\r\nrecently terminated in a complete victory for the latter.\r\n\r\n=Perugia= (anc. _Perusia_). A city of Central Italy, 10 miles east of\r\nthe lake of the same name, and 85 north of Rome. It formed in ancient\r\ntimes one of the twelve Etrurian republics. In conjunction with other\r\ncities of Etruria, it long resisted the power of the Romans, but was\r\nfinally ruined by the latter, having been defeated in two engagements,\r\n309 and 295 B.C., and becoming subject to Rome in 294. It is memorable\r\nin the civil wars as the refuge of L. Antonius, the brother of the\r\ntriumvir, when unable to oppose the progress of Octavianus. It was held\r\nby the latter for some months and was compelled to surrender through\r\nfamine, and burned to the ground in 40 B.C. It was afterwards rebuilt by\r\nAugustus, and was captured by the Goths under Totila at the fall of the\r\nWestern empire. It was afterwards united to the Papal States, and in\r\n1860 became part of the kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Perugia, Lake of.= See TRASIMENUS LACUS.\r\n\r\n=Perusia.= See PERUGIA.\r\n\r\n=Pescara.= A town of Italy, province of Chieti. It was formerly strongly\r\nfortified, and has stood many sieges.\r\n\r\n=Peschiera.= A frontier town and fortress of Italy, in Lombardy, at the\r\nsouth extremity of the Lake of Garda, 20 miles north-northwest from\r\nMantua. Peschiera commands the right bank of the river Mincio. During\r\nthe French republican war, it was a simple pentagon. Its fortifications,\r\nhowever, have been greatly strengthened by the Austrians. It is defended\r\nby walls and by forts, lunettes, fosses, and a covered way; and the\r\npurpose which it is mainly intended to serve, besides that of forming an\r\nintrenched camp capable of accommodating a considerable number of\r\ntroops, is to harass an army attempting to cross the Mincio by Goito or\r\nValeggio. It has been taken frequently by siege, by the French in 1796;\r\nby the Austrians and Russians, 1799; by the French again, 1801; given up\r\nby them, 1814; taken by the Sardinian troops under Charles Albert, May\r\n30, 1848; retaken by Radetzky, 1849. It was invested by the Sardinians\r\nin June, 1859, after the battle of Solferino. The conclusion of the\r\ntreaty of Villafranca, however (July 11, 1859), relieved Peschiera from\r\na siege, and it was included in the kingdom of Italy by treaty of\r\nVienna, 1866.\r\n\r\n=Peshawur.= A city of British India, capital of the province of Peshawur\r\n(or Peshawer), about 18 miles east of the eastern extremity of the\r\nKhyber Pass. It was founded by the Mogul emperor Akbar. Runjeet Singh\r\ntook it after his victory over the Afghans at Noushera, and destroyed\r\nmany of its finest buildings.\r\n\r\n=Pesth.= A city of Hungary, situated on the Danube, opposite to Buda,\r\nwith which it is connected by a bridge of boats three-quarters of a mile\r\nin length. It was repeatedly taken and besieged in the wars of Hungary,\r\nparticularly in the long contests with the Turks. The great\r\ninsurrection broke out here September 28, 1848. Buda-Pesth was taken by\r\nthe Imperialists, January 5, 1849. The Hungarians afterwards defeated\r\nthe Austrians, who were obliged to evacuate it April 18, 1849; but the\r\nlatter, under Gen. Hentzi, occupied Buda, and a severe contest began\r\nbetween the two parties. On May 4, Görgei, with an army of 40,000\r\nHungarians, occupied the heights above Buda, and began to bombard that\r\ntown; while the Austrians in their turn directed their artillery against\r\nthe lower city of Pesth. On May 16, the Hungarians made an unsuccessful\r\nattack on Buda, but on the 20th the place was taken by assault, after an\r\nobstinate and bloody struggle.\r\n\r\n=Pestle.= An instrument used in the fabrication of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n=Petards.= Are instruments used for blowing open gates, demolishing\r\npalisades, etc. They consist of a half-cone of thick iron, filled with\r\npowder and ball; they are usually fastened to a plank, and the latter is\r\nprovided with hooks to allow of its being attached securely to a gate,\r\netc. The petard has been almost universally superseded by the use of\r\npowder-bags.\r\n\r\n=Petardeer=, or =Petardier=. One who manages petards.\r\n\r\n=Petelia=, or =Petilia= (now _Strongoli_). An ancient Greek town on the\r\neastern coast of Bruttium; founded, according to tradition, by\r\nPhiloctetes. It was situated north of Croton, to whose territory it\r\noriginally belonged, but it was afterward conquered by the Lucanians. It\r\nremained faithful to the Romans when the other cities of Bruttium\r\nrevolted to Hannibal, and it was not till after a long and desperate\r\nresistance that it was taken by one of Hannibal’s generals.\r\n\r\n=Peterero=, or =Pedrero=. A short piece of chambered ordnance was\r\nformerly so called.\r\n\r\n=Petersburg.= A city of Dinwiddie Co., Va., on the south bank of the\r\nAppomattox River, about 25 miles from Richmond. The city is one of\r\nhistoric interest. It was twice occupied by the British forces as\r\nheadquarters during the Revolutionary war; but it is principally noted\r\nas the scene of several sanguinary encounters during the civil war, and\r\nfor the obstinate and bloody defense which it made. On June 15-16, 1864,\r\ntwo formidable assaults were made on it by the Army of the Potomac under\r\nGen. Grant, but they were repulsed with heavy loss. It was then\r\ndetermined to invest the city, which was done a few days later. On July\r\n30, another attempt was made to take it by storm, but without success.\r\nThe siege was prolonged with many indecisive operations until April 3,\r\n1865, after a week’s bombardment it was evacuated by Gen. Lee, who\r\nsurrendered six days later.\r\n\r\n=Petersburg, St.= The capital and most populous city of the Russian\r\nempire, at the mouth of the Neva in the Gulf of Finland, 16 miles east\r\nof Cronstadt, and 400 miles northwest of Moscow. It was founded by Peter\r\nthe Great, May 27, 1703. The peace of St. Petersburg, between Russia\r\nand Prussia, the former restoring all her conquests to the latter, was\r\nsigned May 5, 1762. Treaty of St. Petersburg for the partition of\r\nPoland, August 5, 1772. Treaty of St. Petersburg, led to a coalition\r\nagainst France, September 8, 1805. Treaty of Alliance, signed at St.\r\nPetersburg, between Bernadotte, prince royal of Sweden, and the emperor\r\nAlexander; the former agreeing to join in the campaign against France,\r\nin return for which Sweden was to receive Norway, March 24, 1812.\r\n\r\n=Peterwalden= (Germany), Convention of. Between Great Britain and\r\nRussia, by which a firm and decisive alliance between these powers was\r\nmade against France and the course of action against Napoleon Bonaparte\r\nwas planned, signed July 8, 1813. This alliance led to the overthrow of\r\nBonaparte in the next year.\r\n\r\n=Peterwardein=, or =Varadin=. The capital town of Slavonia, Austria, and\r\nthe strongest fortress on the Danube, is situated on a scarped rock, on\r\nthe right bank of the Danube, opposite Neusatz, with which town it is\r\nconnected by a bridge of boats, defended by a strong _tête-de-pont_, 44\r\nmiles northwest of Belgrade. It is the residence of the general\r\ncommandant of the Slavonian military frontier, and of several\r\nsubordinate military authorities. It derives its present name from Peter\r\nthe Hermit, who here marshaled the soldiers of the first Crusade.\r\nPeterwardein was taken by the Turks, July, 1526. In 1688, the\r\nfortifications were blown up by the Imperialists, and the town was soon\r\nafter burned to the ground by the Turks; but at the peace of\r\nPassarowitz, on July 21, 1718, it remained in the possession of the\r\nemperor. It was here that, on August 5, 1716, the Austrians, under\r\nPrince Eugène, obtained a great victory over the Turks under Grand Vizer\r\nAli; the latter then lost their last footing in Central Europe.\r\n\r\n=Petra.= The _Sela_ of the Old Testament, the chief town of Arabia\r\nPetræa, once the capital of the Idumeans, and subsequently of the\r\nNabatæi. It was subdued by A. Cornelius Palma, a lieutenant of Trajan’s,\r\nand remained under the dominion of the Romans a considerable time, and\r\nits destruction is supposed at length to have been wrought by the\r\nMohammedans.\r\n\r\n=Petra.= An ancient town of Colchis, in the land of the Lazi, founded by\r\nJoannes Tzibus, a general of Justinian, to keep these people in\r\nsubjection. It was situated on a rock near the coast, and was very\r\nstrongly fortified. It was taken by Chosroes in 541 A.D., and its\r\nsubsequent siege by the Romans is described by Gibbon as one of the most\r\nremarkable actions of the age. The first siege was relieved; but it was\r\nagain attacked by the Romans, and was at length taken by assault, after\r\na long protracted resistance, in 551 A.D. It was then destroyed by the\r\nRomans, and from that time disappears from history.\r\n\r\n=Petra.= An ancient and strong fortress in Sogdiana, held by Arimazes\r\nwhen Alexander attacked it.\r\n\r\n=Petronel= (Fr. _petrinal_, or _poitronal_). A piece between a carbine\r\nand a pistol (with a wheel-lock), which was used by the French during\r\nthe reign of Francis I.; it was held against the breast when fired. To\r\nprevent any injury from its recoil, the soldier who used it was provided\r\nwith a pad.\r\n\r\n=Petropaulovski.= A fortified town on the east coast of Kamtschatka, was\r\nattacked by an English and French squadron August 30, 1854. They\r\ndestroyed the batteries, and a party of 700 sailors and marines landed\r\nto assault the place, but fell into an ambuscade, and many were killed.\r\nAfter this the Russians greatly strengthened their defenses, but on May\r\n30, 1855, the allied squadron in the Pacific arriving here found the\r\nplace deserted. The fortifications were destroyed, but the town was\r\nspared.\r\n\r\n=Pettah.= In Southern India, a term applied to the _enceinte_ of a town,\r\nas distinguished from the fortress by which it is protected.\r\n\r\n=Pettman Fuze.= See FUZE.\r\n\r\n=Pfaffendorf and Liegnitz.= See LIEGNITZ.\r\n\r\n=Pfedersheim.= A town of Germany, in Hesse-Darmstadt, 4 miles northwest\r\nfrom Worms. A battle was fought here, in 1555, which brought the\r\n“Peasants’ war” to a termination.\r\n\r\n=Phalanx.= The ancient Greek formation for heavy infantry, which won for\r\nitself a reputation of invincibility. It may be described as a line of\r\nparallel columns, rendered by its depth and solidity capable of\r\npenetrating any line of troops. The oldest phalanx was the Lacedæmonian,\r\nor Spartan, in which the soldiers stood 8 deep, but this was reduced to\r\n4 men by Miltiades, in order to increase his front at the battle of\r\nMarathon, 480 B.C. The Macedonian phalanx, as the latest form that\r\norganization assumed, and as the shape in which the phalanx encountered\r\nthe military skill of the West, is deserving of description. The line\r\nwas 16 deep: a grand-phalanx comprising 16,384 men, composed of four\r\nphalanxes or divisions, each under a general officer, called a\r\n_phalangarch_; his command was divided into two brigades, or\r\n_merarchies_, each of these comprising two regiments, or _chiliarches_,\r\nof four battalions, or _syntagmata_, each, and each syntagma of 16 men\r\neach way, making a perfect square. The Roman legion was far superior to\r\nthe phalanx.\r\n\r\n=Phalsbourg.= A strong town of Alsace, department of La Meurthe,\r\nNortheast France. It was ceded to France in 1661, and its fortress\r\nerected by Vauban, 1679. It checked the progress of the victorious\r\nallies both in 1814 and 1815, and withstood the Germans from August 16\r\nto December 12, 1870, when it capitulated unconditionally.\r\n\r\n=Pharax.= One of the council of ten appointed by the Spartans in 418\r\nB.C. to control Agis. At the battle of Mantinea in that year, he\r\nrestrained the Lacedæmonians from pressing too much on the defeated\r\nenemy, and so running the risk of driving them to despair. In 396 B.C.\r\nhe laid siege with 120 ships to Caunus, where Conon was stationed, but\r\nwas compelled to withdraw by the approach of a large force.\r\n\r\n=Pharsalus= (now _Fersala_, or _Pharsalia_). Anciently a town of\r\nThessaly, to the south of Larissa, on the river Enipeus, a branch of the\r\nPeneus (now the Salambria), and historically notable mainly for the\r\ngreat battle fought here between Cæsar and Pompey, August 9, 48 B.C.\r\nPompey had about 45,000 legionaries, 7000 cavalry, and a great number of\r\nlight-armed auxiliaries. Cæsar had 22,000 legionaries and 1000 German\r\nand Gallic cavalry. The battle-cry of Cæsar’s army was “_Venus victrix_”\r\nthat of Pompey’s “_Hercules invictus_.” Cæsar’s right wing began the\r\nbattle by an attack on the left wing of Pompey, which was speedily\r\nrouted. Pompey fled into the camp, and his army broke up; Cæsar’s troop\r\nstormed his camp about mid-day, and he himself, awaking as from\r\nstupefaction, fled to Larissa, whither Cæsar followed him next day.\r\nCæsar lost about 1200 men. On Pompey’s side about 6000 legionaries fell\r\nin battle, and more than 24,000 who had fled, were taken, whom Cæsar\r\npardoned and distributed among his troops.\r\n\r\n=Pheon.= In heraldry, the barbed iron head of a dart; used also as a\r\nroyal mark, to denote crown property, and termed the _broad_, or _broad\r\narrow_.\r\n\r\n=Philadelphia.= A city and metropolis of Pennsylvania, situated between\r\nthe Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers. The city was settled and planned by\r\nWilliam Penn in 1682, and its name (City of Brotherly Love) given\r\nthrough the Society of Friends, of whom he was the great leader in\r\nAmerica. It had a prominent position in the Revolution, and was in\r\npossession of the British troops after the disastrous battles of\r\nBrandywine and Germantown, until 1778. Being the second city of the\r\nUnited States in wealth and importance, it has been ever forward in\r\npromoting her interests.\r\n\r\n=Philibeg.= See FILLIBEG.\r\n\r\n=Philiphaugh.= Near Selkirk, Southern Scotland, where the Marquis of\r\nMontrose and the royalists were defeated by David Leslie and the Scotch\r\nCovenanters, September 13, 1645.\r\n\r\n=Philippi.= A city of Macedonia. It was named after Philip II. of\r\nMacedon, who conquered it from Thrace. Here Antony and Octavianus, in\r\ntwo battles, defeated the republican forces of Cassius and Brutus, who\r\nboth committed suicide, October, 42 B.C.; this ended the republican\r\ngovernment of Rome.\r\n\r\n=Phocæa.= The most northern of the cities of Ionia, was situated about\r\n25 miles northwest from Smyrna. It was founded by a colony of Phocians,\r\nled by two Athenians, Philogenes and Damon. Its citizens are said to\r\nhave been the first among the Greeks who extended their commercial\r\nvoyages to great distances; and its inhabitants abandoned their city\r\nrather than submit to the Persians, 544 B.C. They settled in Italy, and\r\nfounded Velia. Massilia in France, and Alalia in Corsica, were colonies\r\nof the Phocæans.\r\n\r\n=Phocis.= A province of Greece Proper, or Hellas, bounded on the north\r\nby the Ozolian Lokri, on the north by Doris, on the east by the Opuntian\r\nLokri, and on the south by the Gulf of Corinth. During the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, the Phocians were close allies of the Athenians. In 357 B.C. they\r\nseized Delphi, and commenced the second Sacred war.

The natives were the most eminent navigators and\r\ntraders of antiquity; their cities or allied states being Tyre, Sidon,\r\nBerytus, Tripolis, Byblos, and Ptolemais, or Acre. From the 19th to the\r\n13th century B.C., they established colonies on the shores or isles of\r\nthe Mediterranean, Carthage, Hippo, Utica, Gades, Panormus, and are said\r\nto have visited the British Isles. Phœnicia was conquered by Cyrus, 537\r\nB.C.; by Alexander, 332; by the Romans, 47; and after partaking of the\r\nfortunes of Palestine, was added to the Ottoman empire, 1516.\r\n\r\n=Phous-dan.= An East Indian term for a commander of a large body of\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n=Phrygia.= A country of Asia Minor.

The kingdom of\r\nPhrygia was conquered by Crœsus, and formed part of the Persian,\r\nMacedonian, and Syro-Grecian empires; but, under the last, the\r\nnorthwestern part was conquered by the Gauls; and a part west of this\r\nwas subjected by the kings of Bithynia; this last portion was the object\r\nof a contest between the kings of Bithynia and Pergamus. The whole of\r\nPhrygia was assigned by the Romans to the kingdom of Pergamus, after the\r\noverthrow of Antiochus the Great in 190 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Piacenza= (anc. _Placentia_).

It is of an oblong form, surrounded by\r\nancient walls and ditches, and defended by a citadel, which was\r\ngarrisoned by the Austrians till 1859. Piacenza is first mentioned in\r\n219 B.C., when a Roman colony was settled there. In 200 B.C. it was\r\nplundered and burned by the Gauls, but rapidly recovered its prosperity,\r\nand was long an important military station. It was the western terminus\r\nof the great Æmilian road, which began at Ariminum on the Adriatic. In\r\nlater history, it plays an important part as one of the independent\r\nLombard cities.\r\n\r\n=Pianosa.= An island in the Mediterranean, about 10 miles\r\nsouth-southwest of Elba.

A town in the south of\r\nCampania, at the head of the Sinus Pæstanus, and between Salernum and\r\nthe frontiers of Lucania, the inhabitants of which were compelled by the\r\nRomans, in consequence of their revolt to Hannibal, to abandon their\r\ntown and live in the neighboring villages. Between the town and the\r\nfrontiers of Lucania, there was an ancient temple of the Argive Juno,\r\nsaid to have been founded by Jason, the Argonaut. The name of Picentia\r\nwas not confined to the inhabitants of Picentia, but was given to the\r\ninhabitants of the whole coast of the Sinus Pæstanus, from the\r\npromontory of Minerva to the river Silarus. They were a portion of the\r\nSabine Picentes, who were transplanted by the Romans to this part of\r\nCampania after the conquest of Picenum, 268 B.C., at which time they\r\nfounded the town of Picentia.\r\n\r\n=Picentines= (_Picentes_). A Sabine tribe, subdued by the Romans, and\r\ntheir capital, Asculum, taken, 268 B.C.

The Picentes, its\r\ninhabitants, remained long in undisturbed tranquillity, while the\r\nneighboring tribes were vainly struggling against the all-usurping\r\nambition of Rome. That power condescended in 299 B.C. to enter into an\r\nalliance with them. Even when they were at length obliged, in 268 B.C.,\r\nto bow before the resistless destinies of the Romans, they suffered\r\nlittle injury. It was not until the outbreak of the Social war, in 90\r\nB.C., that the Picentes appear to have experienced the toils and\r\ncalamities of a great struggle. Then they assumed an active and zealous\r\npart in the general revolt against Rome. Their capital city, Asculum,\r\ngave the signal of insurrection, by assassinating the Roman proconsul.\r\nTheir armies kept the Roman general Cn. Pompeius Strabo for a long time\r\nat bay. Nor when the tide of battle began to turn against them did their\r\ncourage waver. They continued to fight until 89 B.C., and were put down\r\nby sheer force.\r\n\r\n=Pichegru’s Conspiracy.= See GEORGES CONSPIRACY.\r\n\r\n=Pickeer.= To pillage; to pirate.

The ancient inhabitants of the northeast provinces of\r\nScotland. The Pictish territory extended along the whole sea-coast from\r\nthe Firth of Forth to the Pentland Firth. It was bounded on the west by\r\nthe country of the Scots, which extended along the western coast from\r\nthe Firth of Clyde to the modern Ross-shire; but the precise line\r\nbetween the two nations cannot be ascertained. The country of the Picts\r\nwas bounded on the south by the Firth of Forth and the province of\r\nLothian, then possessed by the English; while the country of the Scots\r\nhad for its southern boundaries the Firth of Clyde and the kingdom of\r\nCumbria, held by the independent Britons. In the middle of the 7th\r\ncentury, a portion of the southern province of the Pictish territories\r\nwas subdued by Oswy, king of Northumbria. Egfrid, Oswy’s son and\r\nsuccessor, seems to have contemplated the subjugation of the whole\r\nPictish kingdom. He advanced northwards with his army; Brude, son of\r\nBili, king of the Picts, retreating before him. The English sovereign\r\npassed the Tay, and the Picts made a stand at Nechtansmere, supposed to\r\nbe Dunnichen, in Anchus; the English were utterly defeated, and their\r\nking slain, May 20, 685. The most active of all the Pictish sovereigns\r\nwas Hungus, son of Urgust, who succeeded, in 730, and reigned for thirty\r\nyears. He was in constant wars with the Scots, the Britons, and the\r\nEnglish, in which he was generally victorious. After his death the\r\nkingdom began to decline. Between 838 and 842, the Scots under Kenneth\r\nII. totally subdued the Picts, and seized all their kingdom. Their\r\nincursions in England led to the Saxon invasion.\r\n\r\n=Picts’ Wall.= One of the barriers erected by the Romans across the\r\nnorthern part of England to restrain the incursions of the Picts (which\r\nsee).\r\n\r\n=Piece.= A general name for any kind of ordnance or musket.\r\n\r\n=Piece.= In heraldry, an ordinary or charge; as, the fesse, the bend,\r\nthe pale, the bar, the cross, the saltire, the chevron, are called\r\nhonorable _pieces_.\r\n\r\n=Piece, Battering-.= See BATTERING-PIECES.\r\n\r\n=Piece, Field-.= See FIELD-PIECE.\r\n\r\n=Piedmont.= An Italian principality, which now forms the northwest part\r\nof the kingdom of Italy. In 1796 it was seized by the French, and\r\nparceled out into six departments, five being incorporated with France,\r\nand one with the kingdom of Italy, but after the fall of Napoleon, the\r\nhouse of Savoy recovered possession of it. Since 1860 the name Piedmont,\r\nas a provincial designation, has been disused; and in the new division\r\nof Italy into provinces, the boundaries of Piedmont as a distinct\r\ncountry have been disregarded.\r\n\r\n=Piegans.= A tribe of Blackfeet Indians, numbering about 2000, who\r\nreside in Montana, and were frequently at war with the Shoshones, Flat\r\nHeads, and Gros Ventres. Like the majority of nomadic tribes, they at\r\nvarious times make raids on the settlers, and as a natural result\r\nrequire the correctionary discipline of the military forces. In 1870\r\nthey were severely punished by Col. Baker, and, owing to disease and\r\npestilence, they will probably soon cease to exist.\r\n\r\n=Pierced.= In heraldry, a term used to indicate that a charge is\r\nperforated so as to show the field beneath it.

The Macedonians carried pikes 24 feet long;\r\nthose of modern warfare averaged 12 or 14 feet. They were of stout wood,\r\nand tipped with a flat iron spear-head, which sometimes had cutting\r\nedges. As a defense against cavalry, the pike, from its length and\r\nrigidity, was of great value; but though it long survived the\r\nintroduction of gunpowder, that event was really fatal to it. For\r\nsuccess with the pike, especially in offensive war, a depth of several\r\nmen was essential, and this depth rendered the fire of artillery\r\npeculiarly fatal. The pike is now superseded by the bayonet on the end\r\nof the musket.\r\n\r\n=Pikestaff.= The wooden pole or handle of a pike.\r\n\r\n=Pile.= A beam of wood driven into the ground to form a solid foundation\r\nfor building. Also a heap, as a pile of balls.

Prepare the\r\nground for the base of the pile by raising it above the surrounding\r\nground so as to throw off the water; level it, ram it well, and cover it\r\nwith a layer of screened sand. Make the bottom of the pile with a tier\r\nof unserviceable balls buried about two-thirds of their diameter in the\r\nsand; this base may be made permanent; clean the base well and form the\r\npile, putting the fuze-holes of shells downwards, in the _intervals_,\r\nand not resting on the shells below. Each pile is marked with the number\r\nof serviceable balls it contains. The base may be made of bricks,\r\nconcrete, stone, or with borders and braces of iron. Grape- and\r\ncanister-shot should be oiled or lackered, put in piles, or in strong\r\nboxes, on the ground-floor, or in dry cellars; each parcel marked with\r\nits kind, caliber, and number.\r\n\r\n=Pile.= In heraldry, one of the lesser ordinaries, having the form of a\r\nwedge, usually placed pale-wise, with the broadest end uppermost,\r\nresembling a pile used in laying the foundations of buildings in watery\r\nplaces, whence it has its name.\r\n\r\n=Pile.= The head of an arrow was formerly so called.\r\n\r\n=Pile Arms, To.= To place three guns together in such a manner that they\r\nmay stand upright steadily.

Pillnitz acquires a historic interest from the meeting of\r\nprinces held in the castle in August, 1791, when the Declaration of\r\nPillnitz was framed, according to which Austria and Prussia agreed to\r\ndeclare the circumstances of the king of France (then a prisoner in the\r\nTuileries, after his ineffective flight to Varennes) to be a matter of\r\ncommon interest to the sovereigns of Europe, and to express the hope\r\nthat common cause would be made for his restoration. The convention of\r\nPillnitz took place between the emperor Leopold and the king of Prussia,\r\nJuly 20, 1791. On August 27, 1791, the treaty of Pillnitz, or as some\r\nstyle it, the Partition Treaty, was finally agreed upon at Pavia by the\r\ncourts in concert. It was to the effect “that the emperor should retake\r\nall that Louis XIV. had conquered in the Austrian Netherlands, and\r\nuniting these provinces to the Netherlands, give them to his serene\r\nhighness the elector palatine, to be added to the palatinate; Bavaria to\r\nbe added to Austrian possessions,” etc.\r\n\r\n=Pillow, Fort.= See FORT PILLOW.\r\n\r\n=Pilon= (_Fr._).

The name is properly that of persons who\r\ntravel with grain and merchandise; but war affording so many\r\nopportunities and creating so many necessities, the merchants, as it is\r\nall over the world, become plunderers and the worst of enemies.\r\n\r\n=Pinerolo=, or =Pignerol=. A town of Northern Italy, province of Turin.\r\nIt is surrounded by a wall of no great strength, and though originally a\r\npart of Piedmont, was in possession of France from 1631 till the peace\r\nof Utrecht in 1713.

One of the oldest and most beautiful cities of\r\nItaly, and, till lately, the capital of the now extinct grand duchy of\r\nTuscany, on the banks of the river Arno. Pisæ was one of the twelve\r\ncities of Etruria; it is frequently mentioned in the Ligurian wars as\r\nthe headquarters of the Roman legions. Early in the 11th century, Pisa\r\nhad risen to the rank of a powerful republic. Its troops took part in\r\nall the great events of the Holy Land; and its fleet in turn gave aid to\r\nthe pope in Southern Italy, to the emperor in Northern France, chastised\r\nthe Moors, and exacted its own terms from the Eastern emperors. In their\r\nwars with the Saracens of Sardinia, the Pisans had conquered Sardinia,\r\nCorsica, and the Balearic Islands, and for a time maintained their\r\nground against their hereditary enemies, the Genoese; but having sided\r\nwith the Ghibellines in the long wars which desolated the empire, Pisa\r\nsuffered severely at the hands of the victorious Guelphic party. Indeed,\r\nthe rivalry of the Guelphic cities of Florence, Lucca, and Siena nearly\r\nbrought Pisa to the brink of ruin at the close of the 13th century; and\r\nafter struggling for more than a hundred years against external foes and\r\nthe internal dissensions between the democratic mob and the Ghibelline\r\nnobles, without losing their character for indomitable valor, the Pisans\r\nfinally threw themselves under the protection of Galeazzo Visconti of\r\nMilan. It became subject to Florence after a long siege, 1405-6. In\r\n1494, Pisa became independent under the protection of Charles VIII. of\r\nFrance. When the French left Italy, the old struggle was renewed; and\r\nafter offering a desperate resistance, the Pisans, in 1509, were\r\ncompelled by hunger to surrender the city to the Florentine army\r\nbesieging the walls.\r\n\r\n=Pisidia.= A district of Asia Minor, originally included within\r\nPamphylia, or Phrygia, was constituted a separate province in the\r\ndivision of the Roman empire under Constantine the Great. It was bounded\r\nnorth and west by Phrygia and Lycia, and south by Pamphylia, and east by\r\nCilicia and Isauria. The inhabitants were a lawless and freebooting\r\npeople, spurning the advance of civilization, and daring any invader to\r\nfollow them into their rugged fastnesses. Rome conquered them only to\r\nfind that their spirit of independence was not broken. They would not\r\nbrook the establishment of a single garrison or colony. It was only\r\ntheir towns that paid tribute. They carried their invincible\r\ndispositions down to modern times; and under the appellation of\r\n_Karamanians_ they still continue to be wild, rapacious, and suspicious\r\nof strangers.\r\n\r\n=Pistol.= Is the smallest description of fire-arm, and is intended to be\r\nused with one hand only.

They are carried in holsters at the\r\nsaddle-bow, in the belt, or in the pocket. Every cavalry soldier should\r\nhave pistols, for a fire-arm is often of great service for personal\r\ndefense, and almost indispensable in giving an alarm or signal. Of late\r\nyears pistols have been made with revolving cylinder breeches, in which\r\nare formed several chambers for receiving cartridges, and bringing them\r\nin succession into a line with the barrel ready for firing.

An English expedition against this fort under Gen. Braddock\r\nwas defeated by the French and Indians, July 9, 1755. In 1758 another\r\nEnglish expedition marched against this post, which was then regarded by\r\nthe youthful Washington as the key of the West. An advanced detachment\r\nunder Capt. Grant having encamped on what is still called Grant’s Hill,\r\nwas attacked and defeated by a party of French and Indians from Fort\r\nDuquesne. But on the approach of Gen. Forbes, with a force of 6200 men,\r\nthe disheartened garrison set fire to the fort and descended the Ohio\r\nRiver. The victorious troops, on entering, November 25, by general\r\nacclamation called the place Pittsburgh, in honor of William Pitt, then\r\nprime minister of England. The town of Pittsburgh was incorporated as a\r\nborough in 1804, and chartered as a city in 1816.\r\n\r\n=Pivot.= That officer or soldier upon whom the company wheels.\r\n\r\nThe _pivot flank_ in a column is that which when wheeled up preserves\r\nthe proper front of divisions of the line in their natural order. The\r\nopposite flank of the column is called the reverse flank.\r\n\r\n=Pivot-gun.= A cannon which turns on a pivot in any direction.\r\n\r\n=Pivot-man.= The same as pivot (which see).\r\n\r\n=Pizzo.= A city of Italy, in the Neapolitan province of Calabria Ultra\r\nII., situated on the Gulf of Santa Euphemia, 6 miles northeast from\r\nMonteleone. It was at Pizzo that Murat, the ex-king of Naples, landed\r\nwith a few followers, October 8, 1815, with the view of recovering his\r\nkingdom, He was immediately taken prisoner and shot in the castle of\r\nPizzo on the 13th. In 1860 it was taken by Garibaldi.\r\n\r\n=Placage= (_Fr._). In fortification, a kind of revetment, which is made\r\nof thick plastic earth laid along the talus of such parapets as have no\r\nmason-work, and which is covered with turf.\r\n\r\n=Place.= In fortification, signifies, in general terms, a fortified\r\ntown, a fortress; hence we say it is a strong place.\r\n\r\n=Place Basse= (_Fr._). In fortification, the lower flanks according to\r\ncertain systems are so called.\r\n\r\n=Placed, To be.= This expression is frequently used in military matters,\r\nto signify the appointment or reduction of officers. Hence, _to be\r\nplaced_ upon full or half-pay. It is more generally applicable to the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n=Placentia.= See PIACENZA.\r\n\r\n=Places of Arms.= This term has various significations, although it\r\nuniformly means places which are calculated for the rendezvous of men in\r\narms, etc. When an army takes the field, every stronghold or fortress\r\nwhich supports its operations by affording a safe retreat to its depots,\r\nheavy artillery, magazines, hospitals, etc., is called a _place of\r\narms_. In offensive operations, those lines are called _places of arms_,\r\nor parallels, which unite the different means of attack, secure the\r\nregular approaches, etc., and contain bodies of troops who either do\r\nduty in the trenches, protect the workmen, or are destined to make an\r\nimpression upon the enemy’s outworks. There are _demi-places of arms_\r\nbetween the _places of arms_. These are more or less numerous in\r\nproportion to the resistance made by the besieged. See RE-ENTERING\r\nPLACES OF ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Plain.= A field of battle.\r\n\r\n=Plan.= A scheme devised; a method of action or procedure expressed or\r\ndescribed in language; a project. A plan of campaign (says Napoleon)\r\nshould anticipate all that an enemy may do, and combine within itself\r\nthe means necessary to baffle it. Plans of campaign are modified by\r\ncircumstances, the genius of the chief, the nature of the troops, and\r\ntopography. There are good and bad plans of campaign, but sometimes the\r\ngood fail from misfortune or mismanagement, while the bad succeed by\r\ncaprices of fortune.\r\n\r\n=Plan of a Work.= A plan shows the tracing; also the horizontal lengths\r\nand breadths of the works; the thickness of the ramparts and parapets;\r\nthe width of the ditches, etc. It exhibits the extent, division, and\r\ndistribution of the works; but the depth of the ditches and the height\r\nof the works are not represented in a plan.\r\n\r\n=Plane of Comparison.= In the plan of a fortress, and of the surrounding\r\ncountry, are expressed the distances of the principal points from a\r\nhorizontal plane, imagined to pass through the highest or lowest points\r\nof ground, in the survey. This imaginary plane is called a _plane of\r\ncomparison_.\r\n\r\n=Plane of Defilade.= Is a plane supposed to pass through the summit or\r\ncrest of a work, and parallel to the plane of site.\r\n\r\n=Plane of Fire.= See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Plane of Sight.= See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Plane of Site.= The general level of the ground or ground line, upon\r\nwhich the works are constructed, is called the _plane of site_, whether\r\nthat plane be horizontal or oblique to the horizon.\r\n\r\n=Plane Table.= A surveying instrument, consisting of a table or board\r\nand arrangements for leveling and traversing it. It is much used in\r\nmilitary surveys and in gunnery in getting the ranges of projectiles by\r\nthe method of intersections.\r\n\r\n=Plant, To.= In a military sense, to place; to fix; as, to plant a\r\nstandard. It likewise signifies to arrange different pieces of ordnance\r\nfor the purpose of doing execution against an enemy or his works; hence,\r\nto plant a battery. Some authors apply this word to the act of directing\r\na cannon properly.\r\n\r\n=Plantagenet.= The surname of a dynasty of English kings who ruled from\r\n1154 to 1485. Henry II. was the founder, and Richard III., who was\r\nkilled at Bosworth, the last of the line. They were generally warlike\r\nand ambitious rulers, being engaged in contests at home (see ROSES, WARS\r\nOF THE) and in France. The name belonged to the house of Anjou, and is\r\nsaid to have been derived from the circumstance of the first count of\r\nthis house having caused himself to be scourged with branches of broom\r\n(_planta genista_) as a penance for some crime. The name passed to the\r\nEnglish line of kings through the extinction of the old Norman dynasty\r\nin the male line in the person of Henry II., and the marriage of\r\nMatilda, his daughter, to Geoffrey, count of Anjou, their son succeeding\r\nto the throne.\r\n\r\n=Plassey.= A village of British India, in the district of Nuddea,\r\npresidency of Bengal, on the left bank of the Hooghly, 96 miles north of\r\nCalcutta. It is memorable as the scene of the victory that laid the\r\nfoundation of the British-Indian empire. On June 23, 1757, Clive, with a\r\nforce of 900 Europeans and 2100 Sepoys, crossed the river to attack\r\n68,000 men under Sooraj-oo-Dowlah, soubahdar of Bengal. After much\r\ncannonading on both sides, Meer Jaffier, who was in the interest of the\r\nBritish, advised the soubahdar to retreat. Clive immediately advanced,\r\nrouted the army, and took the camp of the soubahdar, who was dethroned\r\nto make way for the traitor Meer Jaffier.\r\n\r\n=Plastron= (_Fr._). Stuffed pad or cushion, formerly worn at the\r\nshoulder to sustain the recoil of heavy muskets and other fire-arms,\r\nstill used by fencers upon the right side; also a breastplate or half\r\ncuirass. In the old French service, the gens d’armes, the heavy cavalry,\r\nthe light horse, etc., were obliged to wear them on all occasions, at\r\nreviews, etc.\r\n\r\n=Platæa= (more commonly _Platææ_). An ancient city of Bœotia, on the\r\nnorthern slope of Mount Cithæron, on the frontiers of Attica. At an\r\nearly period, the Platæans deserted the Bœotian confederacy, and placed\r\nthemselves under the protection of Athens; and when the Persians invaded\r\nAttica in 490 B.C., they sent 1000 men to the assistance of the\r\nAthenians, and had the honor of fighting on their side at the battle of\r\nMarathon. Ten years afterwards (480 B.C.) their city was destroyed by\r\nthe Persian army under Xerxes at the instigation of the Thebans. It was\r\nthe site of the battle between Mardonius, commander of the army of\r\nXerxes of Persia, and Pausanias, commanding the Lacedæmonians and\r\nAthenians, 479 B.C.; the same day as the battle of Mycale. Of 300,000\r\nPersians, scarce 3000 escaped with their lives. The Grecian army, about\r\n110,000, lost but few men. The Greeks obtained immense plunder, and were\r\nhenceforth delivered from the fear of Persian invasions. In the third\r\nyear of the Peloponnesian war (429), the Thebans persuaded the Spartans\r\nto attack Platæa, and after a siege of two years at length succeeded in\r\nobtaining possession of the place (427). Platæa was then razed to the\r\nground, but was again rebuilt after the peace of Antalcidas (387 B.C.).\r\nIt was destroyed the third time by its inveterate enemies, the Thebans,\r\nin 374 B.C. It was rebuilt by Philip II. of Macedon, after his victory\r\nat Chæronea, 338 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Plate.= Metallic armor composed of broad pieces, and thus distinguished\r\nfrom mail.\r\n\r\n=Plate.= To arm with plate or metal for defense. “Why plated in\r\nhabiliments of war?”\r\n\r\n=Plate-armor.= Armor of strong metal plates for protecting\r\nfortifications and the like; also mail consisting entirely of metallic\r\nplates, formerly worn to protect the person.\r\n\r\n=Platform.= Is a strong flooring upon which a piece of ordnance, mounted\r\non its carriage, is manœuvred when in battery. Its object is to\r\nfacilitate the service of heavy guns and mortars, and to insure accuracy\r\nof fire. Fixed platforms are used for casemate and barbette batteries in\r\nfortifications, and are constructed with the works; siege-platforms for\r\nguns and howitzers; and siege-platforms for mortars; the other kinds are\r\nthe rail-platform, the ricochet-platform, and the platforms for\r\nsea-coast mortars. Platforms should possess strength and portability,\r\nand the pieces composing them should be constructed of the same\r\ndimensions, viz.: 9 feet long, 5 inches wide, and 3¹⁄₂ inches thick. The\r\nweight of each piece in a platform is about 50 pounds; and in a\r\nsiege-platform for guns and howitzers, there are 49 pieces, 1 being used\r\nas a _hurter_ on the front part of the platform to prevent the carriage\r\nfrom running too far forward, and 12 for sleepers. The weight of this\r\nplatform complete is 2601¹⁄₂ pounds. This platform is laid with an\r\nelevation to the rear, of 1¹⁄₂ inches to the yard, or 4¹⁄₂ inches in the\r\nwhole length. This elevation is given to diminish the recoil of the\r\npiece and to permit the water to run off. The length of this platform\r\nis 15 feet by 9 feet. The platform for a siege-mortar is composed of\r\nonly 6 sleepers and 21 deck-planks. It is laid level, and the front and\r\nrear deck-planks are connected by eye-bolts to every sleeper. This\r\nplatform is about 9 feet deep by 9 feet wide, and weighs 1220 pounds.\r\nThe rail-platform for siege-mortars consists of 3 sleepers and 2 rails\r\nfor the cheeks of the mortar-bed to slide on, instead of the deck-plank,\r\nand is very strong, and easily constructed and laid. For method of\r\nlaying platforms for siege-gun or howitzer, and for mortars, see\r\n“Hand-book of Artillery,” by Roberts, pages 143-47.\r\n\r\n=Platform Wagon.= A sort of wagon used for transporting heavy ordnance.\r\n\r\n=Platoon.= Probably from the French _peloton_, a “ball of thread,” a\r\n“knot,” was a term formerly used in the English service to designate a\r\nbody of men who fired together. In U. S. tactics, it is now a recognized\r\nsubdivision of a company, being one-half.\r\n\r\n=Plattsburg.= A township and capital of Clinton Co., N. Y., situated on\r\nboth banks of the Saranac River, at its entrance into Lake Champlain. In\r\nthe bay was fought the naval battle of Champlain, in which the British\r\nflotilla, under Commodore Downie, was defeated by the American commodore\r\nMcDonough, September 11, 1814; while the land forces amounting to 14,000\r\nmen, under Sir George Prevost, were defeated by Gen. Macomb.\r\n\r\n=Play.= Is occasionally applied to a military action; as, the guns\r\nplayed upon the enemy.\r\n\r\n=Plea.= That which is alleged by a party in support of his cause; in a\r\nstricter sense, an allegation of fact in a cause, as distinguished from\r\na demurrer; in a still more limited sense, and in modern practice, the\r\ndefendant’s answer to the plaintiff’s declaration and demand. That which\r\nthe plaintiff alleges in his declaration is answered and repelled or\r\njustified by the defendant’s _plea_.\r\n\r\n=Plevna.= A town of Bulgaria, which became important in a military sense\r\nthrough the battles which took place around it during the Russo-Turkish\r\nwar. The first battle took place July 15-16, 1877, resulting in the\r\ncapture of Nikopolis. The second took place July 30, with considerable\r\nloss to both sides, but without any decisive results. The third took\r\nplace September 11.\r\n\r\n=Plombée= (_Fr._). An ancient war-club, whose head was loaded with lead.\r\n\r\n=Plongée.= In artillery and fortification, means a slope toward the\r\nfront. Thus, in speaking of the course of a shell through the air, its\r\nplongée is from the point of greatest altitude to the point at which it\r\nstrikes the earth. So, in fortification, the plongée is the top of the\r\nparapet, sloping gently toward the front. This depression varies from\r\none-fourth to one-sixth of the thickness of the parapet.\r\n\r\n=Ploy.= To form a column from a line of battle on some designated\r\nsubdivision.\r\n\r\n=Ployments.= A general term for all tactical movements by which a column\r\nis formed from line upon a designated subdivision.\r\n\r\n=Pluck.= Spirit; perseverance under opposition or discouragement;\r\nindomitableness; courage.\r\n\r\n=Plume.= A large and handsome feather worn as an ornament on a helmet,\r\non a military hat, and the like.\r\n\r\n=Plummet.= In gunnery, is a simple line and bob for pointing mortars. A\r\nplummet is also used for regulating the march of infantry. It is made by\r\nmeans of a musket-ball, suspended by a silk string, upon which the\r\nrequired lengths are marked; the length is measured from the point of\r\nsuspension to the centre of the ball. The different lengths of these\r\nplummets are as follows: for common time, 90 steps in a minute, 17.37\r\ninches; quick time, 110 steps in a minute, 11.6 inches; double time, 165\r\nsteps in a minute, 5.17 inches.\r\n\r\n=Plunder.= To take the goods of another by force; to take from by\r\nrobbery; to spoil; to strip; to rob; as, to plunder a place. Also to\r\ntake by pillage or open force; as, the enemy plundered all the goods\r\nthey found.\r\n\r\n=Plunder.= That which is taken from an enemy; pillage; spoil.\r\n\r\n=Plunging Fire.= See FIRE, PLUNGING.\r\n\r\n=Pluteus.= A kind of wicker helmet covered with raw ox-hide, worn by the\r\nancient Greeks when engaged in sapping walls. Others were made of\r\nhurdles, covered in the same way, running upon three wheels, and\r\naffording cover to 7 or 8 miners.\r\n\r\n=Plymouth.= A seaport town in England, county of Devon, on the east side\r\nof a peninsula, between the rivers Plym and Tamar, at the head of\r\nPlymouth Sound, 37 miles southwest of Exeter. Prior to the time of the\r\nNorman conquest it was called _South Town_, or _Sutton_; under the Saxon\r\ndynasty it was called _Tamerweorth_. The growing prosperity of the town\r\nexcited the jealousy of France; and in 1339 a force from thence landed,\r\nand attempted to burn it. They succeeded in burning a portion, but were\r\nultimately repulsed, with the loss of 500 men, by Hugh Courtenay, earl\r\nof Devon, aided by a number of “knights and men of the countrie.” A\r\nsimilar attempt was made in 1377, but with no great result; and after\r\neach, the fortifications were extended and strengthened. In 1335 the\r\nBlack Prince embarked from Plymouth for France, and on his return to\r\nEngland he landed here with his prisoner, King John of France, who had\r\nbeen captured at the famous battle of Poitiers. During the civil war\r\nbetween Charles I. and the Parliament, Plymouth was held by the troops\r\nof the latter party, who, though besieged, and almost reduced by famine,\r\nresisted for three years every effort of the royalists. After the\r\nrestoration the citadel was erected, and in the reign of William III.\r\nthe dock-yard and the naval arsenal were established toward the west,\r\nupon the eastern shore of Hamoaze.\r\n\r\n=Plymouth.= A town of Washington Co., N. C., on the south bank of\r\nRoanoke River about 8 miles from its mouth, where it empties into\r\nAlbemarle Sound. During the civil war it was held for some time by the\r\nUnion troops as a key to the river, and was strongly fortified. On April\r\n17, 1864, a Confederate force under Gen. Hoke attacked this place, and\r\nafter four days’ severe fighting, being five times repulsed with great\r\nslaughter, succeeded in capturing it, by the powerful assistance of an\r\nironclad ram and a floating sharpshooter battery.\r\n\r\n=Pocket Ledger.= In the British service, is a small book in the\r\npossession of each soldier, containing the result of the monthly\r\nsettlement of pay, the state of his savings-bank account, the date of\r\nhis enlistment, his services, wounds, decorations, date of birth, next\r\nof kin, a summary of the regulations which affect him, and many other\r\nuseful particulars.\r\n\r\n=Podoll= (Bohemia). The site of a severe conflict between the Austrians\r\nand a part of the army of Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia, June 26,\r\n1866, in which the latter had the advantage.\r\n\r\n=Point.= In heraldry, a triangular figure issuing from the dexter and\r\nsinister base of the shield. It is common in French and German heraldry,\r\nand occurs in the shield of Hanover, which was a part of the royal arms\r\nof Great Britain from the accession of George I. till that of the\r\npresent sovereign. A shield charged with a point is in heraldic drawing\r\nhardly distinguishable from one parted per chevron.\r\n\r\n=Point d’Appui.= Any particular given point or body, upon which troops\r\nare formed, or by which they are marched, in line or column. _Points\r\nd’appui_ also signify the different advantageous posts, such as castles,\r\nfortified villages, etc., which the general of an army takes possession\r\nof in order to secure his natural position.\r\n\r\n=Point of Alignment.= The point which troops form upon and dress by.\r\n\r\n=Point of Formation.= A point taken, upon which troops are formed in\r\nmilitary order.\r\n\r\n_Perpendicular points_, the points upon which troops march in a\r\nstraight-forward direction.\r\n\r\n_Relative points_, the points by which the parallelism of a march is\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n=Point of Honor.= See HONOR, POINT OF.\r\n\r\n=Point of War.= A loud and impressive beat of the drum, the perfect\r\nexecution of which requires great skill and activity. The point of war\r\nis beat when a battalion charges.\r\n\r\n=Point-blank.= The second point at which the line of sight intersects\r\nthe trajectory of a projectile. See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Point-blank.= Directed in a line toward the object aimed at; aimed\r\ndirectly toward the mark.\r\n\r\n=Point-blank Range.= Is the distance from the muzzle of the piece to\r\nthat point in a projectile’s trajectory where it cuts the prolongation\r\nof the natural line of sight, a second time, the natural line of sight\r\nbeing horizontal. The British define point-blank range as, “the distance\r\nfrom the muzzle to the first graze when the axis of the piece is\r\nparallel to the horizontal plane upon which the carriage stands.” This\r\ndefinition is being adopted in the U. S. service.--See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Point-blank Shot.= The shot of a gun pointed directly toward the object\r\nto be hit.\r\n\r\n=Pointing.= To point or aim a fire-arm is, to give it such direction and\r\nelevation that the projectile shall strike the object.\r\n\r\n_Definitions._--The _axis of the piece_ is the centre line of the bore.\r\n\r\nThe _line of fire_ is the axis of the piece prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe _plane of fire_ is a vertical plane through the line of fire.\r\n\r\nThe _line of sight_ is the right line from the eye to the object to be\r\nhit, passing through the front and rear sights.\r\n\r\nThe _plane of sight_ is a vertical plane through the line of sight.\r\n\r\nThe _angle of sight_, or the _elevation_, is the vertical angle included\r\nbetween the line of sight and the plane containing the axis of the piece\r\nand a horizontal line at right angles to it.\r\n\r\nThe _natural line of sight_ is the line of sight nearest to the axis of\r\nthe piece. In guns without rear sights it is the right line through the\r\nhighest point of the base-ring and swell of the muzzle or top of the\r\nfront sight when there is one. It is sometimes called the _line of\r\nmetal_, as in mortars. For convenience and accuracy the _natural line of\r\nsight_ is usually parallel to the axis of the piece. When special\r\nbreech-sights are used, it passes through the zero of the scale, which\r\nin the _pendulum hausse_ and other vibrating scales coincides with the\r\naxis of vibration. All other lines of sight are called _artificial lines\r\nof sight_.\r\n\r\n_Point-blank_, in small-arms, is the second point in which the natural\r\nline of sight (when horizontal) cuts the trajectory. In artillery, it is\r\nthe point where the projectile first strikes the horizontal plane on\r\nwhich the gun stands, the axis of the piece being horizontal.\r\n\r\n_Pointing Guns and Howitzers._--In pointing old model guns and howitzers\r\nunder ordinary angles of elevation, the piece is first directed toward\r\nthe object, and then elevated to suit the distance. The accuracy of the\r\naim depends: (1) On the fact that the object is situated in the plane of\r\nsight; (2) That the projectile moves in the plane of fire, and that the\r\nplanes of sight and fire coincide, or are parallel and near to each\r\nother; and (3) On the accuracy of the elevation. The first of these\r\nconditions depends on the eye of the gunner, and the accuracy and\r\ndelicacy of the sights; the errors under this head are of but little\r\npractical importance. When the trunnions of the piece are horizontal,\r\nand the sights are properly placed on the surface of the piece, the\r\nplanes of sight and fire will coincide; but when the axis of the\r\ntrunnions is inclined, and the natural line of sight is oblique to the\r\naxis of the bore, the planes are neither parallel nor coincident, but\r\nwill intersect at a short distance from the muzzle, and the aim will be\r\nincorrect. If the natural line of sight be made parallel to the line of\r\nfire, by making the height of the front sight equal to the dispart of\r\nthe piece, the planes of sight and fire will be parallel. Field-guns of\r\nthe present day have special breech-sights or pendulum-sights. The zero\r\nof the scale and top of front sight are in a line parallel to the axis\r\nof the piece, and in pendulum-sights this zero coincides with the pivot\r\nat which the scale vibrates. Siege and sea-coast cannon are generally\r\nfired from fixed platforms, which renders the axis of the trunnions\r\nhorizontal; they are, therefore, not furnished with pendulum-sights, but\r\nusually with breech-sights set in sockets at the breech. In the absence\r\nof a breech-sight the piece can be pointed with a natural line of sight\r\nso as to strike objects not situated at point-blank distance. Owing to\r\nthe shape and size of the reinforce of sea-coast cannon, the natural\r\nline of sight is formed by affixing a front sight to the muzzle, or to a\r\nprojection cast on the piece between the trunnions. Although the latter\r\narrangement does not give quite so long a distance between the sights as\r\nis desirable, it permits the use of a shorter breech-sight, and the\r\nfront sight does not interfere with the roof of the embrasure, when the\r\npiece is fired under high elevation.\r\n\r\n_Errors in Pointing._--When the platform or ground upon which the gun\r\nstands is not level there is an error in pointing (except when\r\ncompensating sights such as the _pendulum hausse_ are used), which\r\nvaries in direction with the circumstances of the pointing and in amount\r\nwith the elevation of the piece.\r\n\r\nIf the _natural line of sight_ is pointed upon the object and the\r\nelevation then given by a gunner’s quadrant or other device, the shot\r\nwill go to the side of the lower wheel. If the gun be depressed, it will\r\ngo to the side of the upper wheel.\r\n\r\nIf the _tangent scale_ or old pattern _breech-sight_ is used with the\r\nordinary fixed muzzle-sight, and it be placed on a chalk-mark just\r\ndetermined, the shot will fall on the side of the upper wheel. If the\r\nscale is placed on the permanent mark, the contrary will hold.\r\n\r\nIf a _socket or fixed breech-sight_ is used, the shot will fall on the\r\nlower or upper side according as the gun is elevated or depressed.\r\n\r\n_Pointing Mortars._--In pointing mortars, the piece is first given the\r\nelevation, and then the direction necessary to attain the object.\r\nMortars are generally fired from behind epaulements, which screen the\r\nobject from the eye of the gunner. The elevation is first given by a\r\ngunner’s quadrant, and the direction is given by moving the mortar-bed\r\nwith a handspike, so as to bring the line of metal into the plane of\r\nsight, which passes through the object and the centre of the platform.\r\nThe plane of sight may be determined in several ways; the method\r\nprescribed is to plant two stakes, one on the crest of the epaulement,\r\nand the other a little in advance of the first, so that the two shall be\r\nin a line with the object, and the gunner standing in the middle of the\r\nrear edge of the platform; a cord is attached to the second stake and\r\nheld so as to touch the first stake; a third stake is driven in a line\r\nwith the cord, in rear of the platform, and a plummet is attached to\r\nthis cord so as to fall a little in rear of the mortar. The cord and\r\nplummet determine the required plane of sight into which the line of\r\nmetal of the mortar must be brought. With the 13-inch mortar mounted\r\nupon centre-pintle chassis, the plane of sight must be so determined as\r\nto pass through the pintle to obtain perfect accuracy. One of the best\r\nmethods of pointing mortars so mounted, is to place on the crest of the\r\nparapet in line with the axis of the platform a goniometer, the alidade\r\nof which can be directed upon the object,--the angle is read from the\r\nvertical plane containing the axis of the platform. The traverse circle\r\nis similarly graduated from the axis of the platform. A pointer attached\r\nto the chassis enables the gunner to lay the mortar very nearly in the\r\nvertical plane passing through the object,--the error being the\r\nperpendicular distance from the pintle to the plane of sight. This is\r\nthe method of Lieut. A. B. Dyer, 4th U. S. Artillery. Gen. Abbot of the\r\nU. S. Engineer Corps used a similar principle during the late war,\r\n1861-65. The usual angle of fire of mortars is 45°, which corresponds\r\nnearly with the maximum range. The advantages of the angle of greatest\r\nrange are: (1) Economy of powder; (2) Diminished recoil, and strain on\r\nthe piece, bed, and platform; (3) More uniform ranges. When the distance\r\nis not great, and the object is to penetrate the roofs of magazines,\r\nbuildings, etc., the force of fall may be increased by firing under an\r\nangle of 60°. The ranges obtained under an angle of 60° are about\r\n_one-tenth_ less than those obtained with an angle of 45°. If the object\r\nbe to produce effect by the bursting of the projectile, the penetration\r\nshould be diminished by firing under an angle of 30°. When the object is\r\nnot on a level with the piece, the angle of greatest range is considered\r\nin practice to be 45° increased or diminished by one-half the angle of\r\nelevation or depression of the object. The angle of fire being fixed at\r\n45° for objects on the same level with the piece, the range is varied by\r\nvarying the charge of powder. Stone-mortars are pointed in the same\r\nmanner as common mortars; the angle of fire for stones is from 60° to\r\n72°, in order that they may have great force in falling; the angle for\r\ngrenades is about 33°, in order that their bursting effect may not be\r\ndestroyed by their penetration into the earth.\r\n\r\n_Night-firing._--Cannon are pointed at night by means of certain marks,\r\nor measurements, on the carriage and platform, which are accurately\r\ndetermined during the day.\r\n\r\n_Pointing Small-arms._--The rear-sights of small-arms are graduated with\r\nelevation marks for certain distances, generally every hundred yards; in\r\naiming with these as with all other arms, it is first necessary to know\r\nthe distance of the object. This being known and the slider being placed\r\nopposite the mark corresponding to this distance, the bottom of the\r\nrear-sight notch, and the top of the front-sight, are brought into a\r\nline joining the object and the eye of the marksman. The term\r\n_coarse-sight_ is used when a considerable portion of the front-sight is\r\nseen above the bottom of the rear-sight notch; and the term\r\n_fine-sight_, when but a small portion of it is seen. The graduation\r\nmarks being determined for a fine-sight, the effect of a coarse-sight is\r\nto increase the true range of the projectile.\r\n\r\n_Graduation of Rear-sights._--If the form of the trajectory be known,\r\nthe rear-sight of a fire-arm can be graduated by calculation; the more\r\naccurate and reliable method, however, is by trial.\r\n\r\n_Distance of Objects._--Various instruments have been devised to\r\ndetermine the distance of objects, based on the measurement of the\r\nvisual angles subtended by a foot or cavalry soldier, of mean height, at\r\ndifferent distances, and upon other principles. (See RANGE-FINDER.) The\r\nrange being known, the proper elevation (or charge of powder in mortars)\r\nand length of fuze is given by tables of fire obtained from calculation\r\nor experiment. The ranges for guns of position are determined by\r\nthorough surveys of the surrounding country or harbor channels, by which\r\nthe distances of all prominent points in the route of an approaching\r\nenemy are fixed beforehand. The ranges in field artillery are usually\r\nobtained by trial shots at the enemy. For small-arm and field-gun\r\nfiring, the importance of at once getting the range cannot be\r\novervalued; hence the importance of _estimating distances_ without\r\ninstrumental aid. The soldier is guided by his experience of aerial\r\nperspective, by the apparent size of known objects, and numerous other\r\naids too delicate for enunciation. The art can be acquired to a high\r\ndegree of perfection by _practice_, which now forms a very important\r\npart of the soldier’s training.\r\n\r\n=Pointing-board.= See BOARD, POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Pointing-cord.= Cord used in pointing mortars (which see). See\r\nPOINTING-STAKES.\r\n\r\n=Pointing-rings.= See ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n=Pointing-stakes.= Are used in pointing mortars, and by them one of the\r\nfixed points is established upon the crest of the parapet or at the foot\r\nof the interior slope, and another in rear of the piece. Then by a cord\r\ncalled the _pointing-cord_, stretched between these two points, with\r\nthe plummet suspended from it, a vertical plane is determined with which\r\nthe line of metal is made to coincide. Mortars are also pointed by means\r\nof _pointing-wires_.\r\n\r\n=Pointing-wires.= Are wires which are used in directing mortars. The two\r\nfixed points required in directing a mortar are determined by planting\r\ntwo wires upon the epaulement, one upon its crest, and the other about a\r\nyard in advance of it, both as nearly as possible in the vertical plane\r\npassing through the centre of the platform and the object. The points\r\nbeing thus established, the direction is thus given to the mortar, by\r\ncausing a plummet held in rear of it to cover the wires and the line of\r\nmetal. This method is defective both in accuracy of aim and the\r\nliability of the wires being deranged by the shots of the enemy or by\r\nother causes.\r\n\r\n=Points of Passing.= The ground on which one or more bodies of armed men\r\nmarch by a reviewing general.\r\n\r\n=Points of the Escutcheon.= In heraldry, in order to facilitate the\r\ndescription of a coat of arms, it is the practice to suppose the shield\r\nto be divided into nine points, which are known by the following names:\r\nThe dexter chief point, the middle chief, the sinister chief, the\r\ncollar, or honor point, the fess point, the nombril, or navel point, the\r\ndexter base point, the middle base point, and the sinister base point.\r\nThe dexter and sinister sides of the shield are so called, not in\r\nrelation to the eye of the spectator, but from the right and left sides\r\nof the supposed bearer of the shield.\r\n\r\n=Poitiers=, or =Poictiers=. A town of France, capital of the department\r\nof Vienne, on the Clain, 58 miles south-southwest of Tours. In the\r\nvicinity of Poitiers, Alaric II., the Visigoth, was defeated and slain\r\nby Clovis in 507. Somewhere between Poitiers and Tours a great battle\r\ntook place on October 10, 732, between the Franks under Charles Martel\r\nand the Saracens under Abder-Rahman. The Saracens were routed with\r\nenormous slaughter,--357,000 of them (according to one old chronicler,\r\nand supposed to be exaggerated) being left dead on the field. Near here\r\nwas fought the battle between Edward the Black Prince and John, king of\r\nFrance, September 19, 1356, in which Edward, with some 12,000 or 14,000\r\nEnglishmen and Gascons, defeated 60,000 of the troops of King John, and\r\ntook the monarch himself and one of his sons prisoners. See TOURS.\r\n\r\n=Poitou.= A former province of Western France, now mainly comprised in\r\nthe departments of Deux Sèvres, Vendée, and Vienne. It became an English\r\npossession in 1152. In 1204, Philip Augustus regained it by conquest\r\nfrom England, and in 1295 it was formally ceded to France. It again\r\nreverted to England in 1360 by the peace of Bretigny, but was retaken by\r\nCharles V., and incorporated with the French crown.\r\n\r\n=Poitrel= (_Fr._). Armor for the breast of a horse.\r\n\r\n=Pokanokets.= See MASSACHUSETTS INDIANS.\r\n\r\n=Poland.= Called by the natives _Polska_, “a plain,” a former kingdom of\r\nEurope,--renowned, in mediæval history, as the sole champion of\r\nChristendom against the Turks, and more recently, and at present, an\r\nobject of general and profound sympathy throughout Western Europe, from\r\nits unprecedented misfortunes. The natives belong to the great Slavonic\r\nfamily. The word Pole is not older than the 10th century. Poland first\r\ntook rank as one of the political powers of Europe, when Micislas I.\r\n(962-992) occupied the throne and became a convert to Christianity.\r\nBoleslas I. (992-1025) surnamed “the Great,” reunited the separate\r\nportions of the kingdom (which had been divided by Micislas among his\r\nsons) and extended it beyond the Oder, the Carpathians, and the\r\nDniester, and sustained a successful war with the emperor Henry II. of\r\nGermany, conquering Cracovia, Moravia, Lusatia, and Misnia. He also took\r\npart in the dissensions among the petty Russian princes. Boleslas was\r\nrecognized as “king” by the German emperors. After a period of anarchy\r\nhe was succeeded by his son, Casimir (1040-1058), whose reign, and that\r\nof his warlike son, Boleslas II. (1058-1081), though brilliant, were of\r\nlittle real profit to the country. Boleslas III. (1102-1139), an\r\nenergetic monarch, annexed Pomerania, defeated the pagan Prussians, and\r\ndefended Silesia against the German emperors. A division of the kingdom\r\namong his sons was productive of much internal dissensions, under cover\r\nof which Silesia was severed from Poland; ultimately, Casimir II.\r\n(1177-1194) reunited the severed portions, with the exception of\r\nSilesia. His death was the signal for a contest among the various\r\nclaimants for the throne, which was speedily followed, as usual, by a\r\ndivision of the country, and during this disturbance Pomerania\r\nemancipated itself from Polish rule. About the same time the Teutonic\r\nKnights were summoned by the Duke of Masovia to aid him against the\r\npagan Prussians, but they soon became as formidable enemies to Poland as\r\nthe Prussians; and conquered a great part of Podlachia and Lithuania.\r\nThe Mongols swept over the country in 1241, reducing it to the verge of\r\nruin, and defeating the Poles in a great battle near Wahlstatt. From\r\nthis time Poland began to decline; various districts were ceded to the\r\nmarkgrafs of Brandenburg, while many districts began to be colonized by\r\nGermans. Ladislaus (1305-1333), surnamed _Lokietek_, “the Short,” again\r\nrestored unity to the country. In conjunction with Gedymin, grand duke\r\nof Lithuania, a vigorous war was carried on against the Teutonic\r\nKnights, on returning from which the aged monarch (he was now seventy\r\nyears old) experienced a triumphant reception from his subjects, who\r\nhailed him as the “father of his country.” His son, Casimir III. the\r\nGreat (1333-1370), greatly increased the power and prosperity of Poland.\r\nIn the latter part of his reign he was compelled to defend sundry new\r\nacquisitions against the Tartars, Lithuanians, and Wallachians, which he\r\ndid successfully. With Casimir, the Piast dynasty became extinct.\r\nJagello (Ladislaus IV.), grand duke of Lithuania, the son-in-law of\r\nLouis the Great, king of Hungary, founded the dynasty of the Jagellons\r\n(1386-1572), and for the first time united Lithuania and Poland. Casimir\r\nIV. (1444-1492) recovered West Prussia from the Teutonic Knights. The\r\nWallachian invaders carried off 100,000 Poles, and sold them to the\r\nTurks as slaves, 1498. Sigismund I. (1506-1548) surnamed “the Great,”\r\nraised the country to the utmost pitch of prosperity; he was forced into\r\na war with Russia, in which he lost Smolensk. Sigismund II., Augustus,\r\nwas a successor worthy of him; Lithuania was finally joined indissolubly\r\nto Poland. Livonia was conquered from the Knights Sword-bearers. (See\r\nSWORD-BEARERS, KNIGHTS.) Stephen Battory (1575-1586), voivode of\r\nTransylvania, the second elective monarch, a man of energy and talent,\r\ncarried on war successfully against the Russians, pursued them into the\r\nvery heart of their own country, and compelled the czar to sue for\r\npeace; he also subdued the semi-independent Cossacks of the Ukraine. His\r\nsuccessor, Sigismund III. (1586-1632), who was succeeded by his sons,\r\nLadislaus VI. (1632-1648) and John Casimir (1648-1672), was of the Vasa\r\nfamily, and was the crown prince of Sweden. These three monarchs were\r\nmost unworthy successors of Poland’s ablest king. They were always\r\nquarreling with their neighbors, declaring war with Russia, Sweden, or\r\nTurkey, in the most imprudent and reckless manner, and often without\r\nvalid pretext. But the Polish armies, though as little fostered and\r\ncared for as the other portion of the nation, were everywhere\r\nvictorious; the Swedish and Muscovite armies were successively\r\nannihilated; Moscow was taken, and the Russians reduced to such an\r\nabject condition that they offered to make Sigismund’s son, Ladislaus,\r\ntheir czar. Sweden made a similar offer to another son of the Polish\r\nmonarch; but the latter’s absurd behavior lost for Poland this rich\r\nresult of her great victories; and the foolish policy of the whole three\r\nnot only rendered fruitless all the lavish expenditure of Polish blood\r\nand treasure, but lost the country many of her richest provinces, and\r\nleft her without a single ally. During the reign of this dynasty\r\nWallachia and Moldavia were snatched by the Turks from under the Polish\r\nprotectorate; Livonia with Riga was conquered (1605-1621), along with a\r\npart of Prussia (1629) by Sweden; and Brandenburg established itself in\r\ncomplete independence. The Cossacks rose in rebellion to a man, put\r\nthemselves under the protection of Russia, and ever afterwards proved\r\nthemselves the most inveterate enemies of the Poles. In the reign of\r\nJohn Casimir, Poland was attacked simultaneously by Russia, Sweden,\r\nBrandenburg, the Transylvanians and the Cossacks; the country was\r\nentirely overrun; Warsaw, Wilna, and Lemburg taken; but Czarniecki,\r\nafter defeating Poland’s enemies in detail, ignominiously expelled them\r\nfrom the country. But in subsequent treaties Ducal or East Prussia was\r\ngiven up to Brandenburg; almost all Livonia to Sweden, and Smolensk,\r\nSeveria, or Tchernigov, and the Ukraine beyond the Dnieper were given to\r\nRussia. During the reign of Michael Wisniowiecki (1668-1674) a war with\r\nTurkey, concluded by an ignominious peace, was the chief event. But the\r\nsenate rejected the shameful treaty, the Polish army was reinforced, the\r\nPolish monarch resigned the command to John Sobieski, and the Turks were\r\nrouted with great slaughter at Choczim (1673). After the reign of\r\nSobieski, Augustus II. of Saxony entered Poland at the head of a Saxon\r\narmy, and succeeded in obtaining the throne. His war with the Turks\r\nrestored to Poland part of the Ukraine and the fortress of Kaminiec; but\r\nthat with Charles XII. brought nothing but misfortune. Augustus returned\r\nafter the battle of Poltava; his rival retired without a contest; a\r\nclose alliance was formed with Russia, and the Russian troops which had\r\ncampaigned in Poland against the Swedes were, along with his Saxon army,\r\nretained. The Poles demanded their extradition, but in vain; and the\r\nRussian cabinet interfered (1717) between the king and his subjects,\r\ncompelling both parties to sign a treaty of peace. This was the\r\ncommencement of Poland’s dependence on Russia and her consequent\r\ndecline. By the instigation of Peter the Great, the Polish army was\r\nreduced from 80,000 to 18,000. For the massacre of Protestants at Thorn\r\nsee MASSACRE. Civil war so weakened the kingdom that it fell an easy\r\nprey to Russia, Austria, and Prussia, in 1772, when the first partition\r\nwas effected. Catherine II. of Russia, on various pretexts, advanced her\r\narmy into Poland (1792), and the fruitless resistance to the united\r\nPrussians and Russians, headed by Joseph Antony Poniatowski and\r\nKosciusko, was followed by a second partition (1793) between Russia and\r\nPrussia, which the diet were forced to sanction at the point of the\r\nbayonet. A general rising took place (1794); the Prussians were\r\ncompelled to retreat to their own country; the Russians were several\r\ntimes routed; but an Austrian army advanced, compelling the Poles to\r\nretreat; and fresh hordes of the Russians arriving, Kosciusko at the\r\nhead of the last patriot army, was defeated; and the sack of Praga,\r\nfollowed by the capture of Warsaw, finally annihilated the Polish\r\nmonarchy. The third and last partition (1795) distributed the remainder\r\nof the country between Russia, Prussia, and Austria. King Stanislaus\r\nresigned the crown, and died broken-hearted at St. Petersburg in 1798.\r\nNapoleon I. established the duchy of Warsaw (1807), chiefly out of the\r\nPrussian share of Poland, with the elector of Saxony at its head. The\r\ndivision of Poland was re-arranged by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. On\r\nNovember 30, 1830, Constantine (brother of the czar and military\r\ngovernor) and his Russians were driven out of Warsaw, and a general\r\ninsurrection of the people, headed by the aristocracy, took place; and\r\nmilitary leaders, as Radzivil, Dembinski, Bem, etc., were soon found.\r\nFrom January, 1831, till September 8 of the same year, a series of\r\nbloody conflicts were fought, in which the Prussians and Austrians, with\r\npitiable subservience, aided the czar. At first, the Poles were\r\nsuccessful; but the taking of the capital by Paskievitch soon ended the\r\nwar, which was followed, as a matter of course, by imprisonment,\r\nbanishment, confiscation, and enforced service in the Russian army. From\r\nthis time, the independence of Poland was suppressed, and in 1832 it was\r\ndeclared to be an integral part of the Russian empire, and the most\r\nsevere and arbitrary measures taken to Russianize the people. The\r\noutbreaks of 1833 and 1846 were punished by the gallows. Simultaneous\r\ndisturbances (1846) in the Prussian and Austrian portions of Poland were\r\nsummarily suppressed; their leaders in Prussia were imprisoned, and only\r\nsaved from death by the revolution of March, 1848, at Berlin; and those\r\nin Austria were butchered by the peasantry, who preferred the Austrian\r\nto a national government. On November 6, 1846, the republic of Cracow\r\nwas incorporated with Austria. In 1861 another insurrection broke out,\r\nand Poland was declared (in October) in a state of siege; the country\r\ncontinued in a state of commotion without any very decided outbreak; and\r\non January 13, 1863, Lithuania and Volhynia were also put in a state of\r\nsiege. In February, 1863, Mieroslavski raised the standard of\r\ninsurrection in the northwest, on the Posen frontier, and many districts\r\nof Augustovo, Radom, Lublin, Volhynia, and Lithuania, were speedily in\r\ninsurrection. It was a mere guerrilla war, and no great or decisive\r\nconflicts took place, but the whole populations of villages were put to\r\nthe sword by the Russians; while murders and assassinations marked the\r\nreign of terror of the National Committee. At last, with the officious\r\nassistance of Prussia, and the secret sympathy and support of Austria,\r\nthe czar’s troops succeeded in trampling out (1864) the last embers of\r\ninsurrection. In 1868 the government of Poland was absolutely\r\nincorporated with that of Russia.\r\n\r\n=Polans.= Knee-pieces in armor.\r\n\r\n=Pole.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, NOMENCLATURE OF ARTILLERY CARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Poleaxe.= An axe fixed to a pole or handle; or rather, a sort of\r\nhatchet with a handle about 15 inches in length, and often a point or\r\nclaw bending downward, or projecting from the back of its head.

Pondicherry was first settled by the French in 1674, they\r\nhaving purchased the town two years before from the rajah of Bejapoor.\r\nThe Dutch took the town in 1693; but by the treaty of Ryswick it was\r\nrestored to the French in 1697. In 1748 it was besieged by the English\r\nunder Admiral Boscawen, who, two months later, was compelled to raise\r\nthe siege. In 1758, Count de Lally became governor-general, and attacked\r\nthe English settlement of Fort St. David, which surrendered, and was\r\ntotally destroyed. In 1761 it was taken by the English, under Col.\r\nCoote. By the peace of Paris, Pondicherry was restored to the French in\r\n1763 with reduced territory. It was again taken by the English under Sir\r\nHector Monro in 1778, and restored in 1783. In 1793 the English again\r\nrepossessed themselves of Pondicherry, but the treaty of Amiens in 1802\r\nagain restored it, but only till the following year. From this time it\r\nwas held by the English till, by the treaties of 1814 and 1815, it was\r\nfor the last time restored to France, reduced to the narrow limits\r\nassigned by the treaty of 1783.\r\n\r\n=Poniard.= A pointed instrument for stabbing; borne in the hand, or at\r\nthe girdle, or in the pocket; a small dagger.\r\n\r\n=Poniard.= To pierce with a poniard; to stab.\r\n\r\n=Pont à Noyelles.= At this place near Amiens, France, took place a\r\nfierce indecisive conflict lasting from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. between the\r\nGermans under Manteuffel and the French Army of the North under\r\nFaidherbe, December 23, 1870.

A soldier having the charge of\r\nconstructing bridges.\r\n\r\n=Pontons.= A kind of portable boats specially adapted for the formation\r\nof floating bridges required by armies. They are constructed in various\r\nways, of wood, metal, or prepared canvas, stretched over frames made for\r\nthe purpose (the latter it is said are much in favor), and have the\r\nnecessary gear placed with them for transport. The ponton used in the\r\nU. S. army is constructed as follows:\r\n\r\nThe _ponton frame_ is composed of two side frames, of twelve narrow and\r\nof two wide transoms. The former are strengthened at the ends by iron\r\nstraps, which are countersunk and perfectly smooth; all the edges of the\r\nframe and transoms are well rounded to prevent chafing the canvas. The\r\nwide transoms are of 10-inch by 1¹⁄₂-inch plank, provided with tenons to\r\nfit the mortises in the frame. The narrow transoms are of 4-inch by\r\n2¹⁄₂-inch scantling. The articles of each of the above classes are made\r\nexactly alike, so that they may be interchanged. Two of the narrow\r\ntransoms are provided with an iron mooring becket.\r\n\r\nThe frame when assembled is held together by a rope passed through the\r\nrings in the ends of the side frame, and tightened with a rack-stick.\r\n\r\nThe _ponton cover_ is of 0000 cotton duck, double-seamed, with the\r\nborder double for 1¹⁄₂ inches in width. The clew-line eyelets are of\r\nmetal. The lashings are of 1-inch rope 18 feet in length, and looped at\r\none end, and the cable used is of 3-inch Manilla rope, 30 fathoms long.\r\n\r\n_Bridge Equipage._--The United States bridge equipage is composed of\r\nreserve and of advance-guard trains. The former are intended to\r\naccompany large bodies of troops in the field, and are provided with the\r\nmaterial necessary for the construction of bridges of sufficient\r\ncapacity to pass large armies with their heaviest trains over rivers of\r\nany size and rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe advance-guard equipage is intended for the use of light troops, such\r\nas advance-guards, cavalry expeditions, etc. It is organized, both as\r\nregards material and carriages, with a view to rapidity of movement. At\r\nthe same time, it is capable of furnishing a bridge which will fulfill\r\nall the requirements of troops engaged on such service.\r\n\r\n_Organization._--The reserve equipage is divided into trains, each of\r\nwhich is composed of four ponton divisions and one supply division. Each\r\ndivision is accompanied by tool-wagon and traveling-forge.\r\n\r\nEach _ponton division_ is complete in itself, containing all the\r\nmaterial necessary for constructing a bridge of eleven bays, or 225 feet\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nEach of these divisions is subdivided into four sections, two of which\r\nare ponton and two abutment sections; the former contain three\r\nponton-wagons and one chess-wagon; the latter, one ponton-, one chess-,\r\nand one trestle-wagon each.\r\n\r\nThe ponton section contains the material for three bays, and should\r\nnever be subdivided. The division may be increased or diminished at\r\npleasure, by the changing the number of its ponton sections.\r\n\r\nThe carriages are loaded as follows: Each ponton-wagon contains 1\r\nponton, 7 long balks, 1 anchor, 1 cable, 5 oars, 2 boat-hooks, 20\r\nlashings, 6 rack-sticks, 1 scoop-shovel, 2 small scoops, 1 axe, 1\r\nhatchet, 1 bucket, and 20 pounds of spun yarn.\r\n\r\nEach trestle-wagon (identical with ponton-wagon) contains 7 long balks,\r\n7 trestle balks, 1 trestle complete, 2 abutment sills, 2 coils of 3-inch\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nEach chess-wagon contains 60 chess.\r\n\r\nThe forge is identical with forge A furnished by the ordnance\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nEach tool-wagon contains 50 axes, 20 shovels, 20 spades, 15 picks, 25\r\nhatchets, 4 broad-axes, 4 adzes, 4 cross-cut saws, 12 augers (assorted),\r\n2 crow-bars, 2 calking-irons, 12 tin lanterns, 2 monkey-wrenches, 1\r\nsledge, 1 steel square, 1 grindstone, 1 spirit-level, 1 coil telegraph\r\nwire, 1 coil 3-inch rope, 1 coil 1-inch rope, 1 coil spun yarn, 50\r\npounds iron (assorted), 25 pounds paint, 6 paint-brushes, 1 dozen chalk\r\nlines, 1 pound red chalk, 4 pounds white chalk, 6 sail-needles, 1 palm,\r\n6 balls twine, 50 pounds 6-inch spikes, 100 pounds 6-, 8-, 10- and\r\n20-penny nails, 2 sets blocks and falls, 2 gross each of 1-, 2- and\r\n5-inch screws, 1 roll canvas, 20 pounds calking cotton. Also 4 boxes of\r\ncarpenters’ and saddlers’ tools nearly identical with those furnished by\r\nthe ordnance department for battery-wagon C. If desirable, extra stores\r\nto the amount of 500 pounds may be added to the load.\r\n\r\nThe _supply division_ is provided with articles necessary to replace\r\nmaterial lost or worn out, such as balk, chess, spare parts of\r\ncarriages, a few complete carriages, etc.\r\n\r\nThe carriages of this division consist of ponton-, chess-, and\r\ntool-wagons, and of forges. Their number and proportion will be\r\ndetermined by the nature of the country in which the army is operating,\r\nand by the proximity of the main depot.\r\n\r\nThe ponton-wagon contains 17 long and 7 trestle balks. The chess-wagon,\r\n60 chess. Tool-wagon No. 1 carries the same load as that attached to a\r\nponton division. Tool-wagon No. 2 contains 80 rack-collars; of 6-, 8-,\r\n10-, and 20-penny nails, 2 kegs each; of 4- and 6-inch spikes, 2 kegs\r\neach; of 1-, 2-, and 5-inch screws, 4 gross each; of 1- and 3-inch rope,\r\n2 coils each.\r\n\r\nThe loads may be increased to the extent that circumstances will permit,\r\nby adding spare parts of carriages.\r\n\r\nThe forges are of the patterns A and B issued by the ordnance\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n_Advance-guard Equipage._--The trains of this equipage are composed of 4\r\nponton divisions, each of which consists of 8 ponton-, 2 chess-, and 2\r\ntrestle-wagons.\r\n\r\nThe load of the _ponton-wagon_ consists of 7 balks, 16 chess, 2 side\r\nframes, 1 cable, 1 anchor, and a ponton-chest containing 1 ponton cover,\r\n14 transoms, 5 paddles, 2 scoops, 2 mallets, 20 lashings, 2 boat-hooks,\r\n1 scoop-shovel, and 8 rack-sticks.\r\n\r\nThe _chess-wagon_ contains 50 chess and 2 spare ponton covers.\r\n\r\nThe trestle-wagon carries 14 balks, 1 trestle complete, 1 abutment sill,\r\nand 1 coil of 3-inch rope and 1 of 1-inch rope.\r\n\r\nThe forge is forge A of the ordnance department.\r\n\r\nWhen necessary, this load may be reduced by transferring a part of the\r\ntools and coal to a forage-wagon.\r\n\r\nThe ponton-wagon carries all the material necessary for constructing a\r\ncomplete bay. The division may, therefore, be increased or diminished by\r\none or more ponton-wagons without disorganizing it. When a forced march\r\nis to be made, and it is desirable to lighten the loads, the chess may\r\nbe removed from the ponton-wagons, the rope from the trestle-wagons, and\r\nthe load of the chess-wagons may be reduced to 40 chess. The number of\r\nthe latter wagons in this case must be increased to five.\r\n\r\nThe tool-wagon is loaded with the necessary tools, materials, etc.,\r\nsuitable to the advance-guard equipage.\r\n\r\nThere are four methods of constructing a ponton-bridge: by successive\r\npontons; by parts; by rafts; and by conversion.\r\n\r\n_By Successive Pontons._--The location of the bridge having been\r\nselected, the ponton-wagons are brought as near the river-bank as\r\npracticable, with the rear of the carriage toward the stream. The\r\npontons are unlashed and slid from the wagon-bed into the water; cables\r\nare attached to the anchors; one of the former is coiled in the bow of\r\neach ponton with its anchor on the top, the flukes projecting over the\r\ngunwale.\r\n\r\nThose pontons which cast up-stream anchors are moored above the approach\r\nto the bridge, and the others below.\r\n\r\nA trench about 1 foot in width and depth is excavated to receive the\r\nabutment sill; this should be laid horizontally, and exactly\r\nperpendicular to the axis of the bridge; it is secured by four pickets,\r\ntwo driven in front and two in rear, about 8 inches from each end. A\r\nponton is brought up opposite to the abutment, and close to the shore.\r\nThe ponton is then pushed off and adjusted in its place by means of\r\nshore-lines, which are made fast to mooring-posts.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first set of balks is laid, a chess is placed on edge in\r\nthe trench above mentioned, and in contact with the ends of the balks.\r\nIts upper edge should be 1¹⁄₂ inches above the balks. Earth is rammed\r\nbehind it, crowding it firmly against the balks. The chess is then laid\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe ponton which has cast the first up-stream anchor, having dropped\r\ndown to the head of the bridge, is entered by the pontoniers. Five balks\r\nare then brought up and delivered to the lashers in the second ponton,\r\nwhich is pushed off; the shore ends of the balks are delivered to the\r\nlashers in the first ponton, who place them on the down-stream side, and\r\nin contact with those of the first set, their cleats against the outside\r\nof the interior gunwale. They lash the balks firmly together and to the\r\nlashing-hooks at both gunwales, and then step into the third ponton.\r\n\r\nWhen a bay is covered with chess, the side-rails are laid. They are\r\nplaced directly over the outside balks, to which they are lashed at\r\nthree points,--at the middle and immediately over the axis of each\r\nponton, at which point the two side-rails and balks of two bays lap and\r\nare all lashed together.\r\n\r\nIn constructing a ponton-bridge there are two points that require\r\nparticular attention: the anchorage, and the lashing; the men who are\r\nintrusted with their execution should be selected from the most\r\nintelligent and experienced pontoniers in the command.\r\n\r\n_The Anchorage._--The distance of the anchor from the bridge should be\r\nat least ten times the depth of the stream; with a less distance the\r\nbows of the ponton would sink too deeply in the water.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the cable when made fast to the bridge must coincide\r\nwith that of the current,--_i.e._, a ponton in the bridge must have the\r\nsame position which it would assume if riding freely at anchor. It will\r\nbe remembered that the cable is not finally made fast to the ponton\r\nwhich casts its anchor, but to the one following it in the bridge; and\r\ndue allowance must be made for this in selecting the place for casting\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nThe number of anchors required will depend somewhat on the strength of\r\nthe current. It is generally sufficient to cast an anchor up-stream for\r\nevery alternate ponton, and half that number down-stream; but where the\r\ncurrent is very rapid it may be necessary to anchor every up-stream\r\nboat, especially near the middle of the bridge. The number of anchors\r\ncannot be much diminished, however moderate the current, as the\r\nanchorage has a very marked effect in checking the horizontal\r\noscillation to which bridges are subject when troops are marching over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_The Lashings._--With respect to the lashings, the corresponding balks\r\nof adjacent bays lap each other by 6 feet, and are lashed together and\r\nto the gunwales at two points about 5 feet apart. Thus a strong splice\r\nis formed, making five continuous beams running the entire length of the\r\nbridge. The stability of the bridge is further increased by the manner\r\nof placing and securing the side-rails.\r\n\r\n_By Parts._--The abutment bay is formed as in the previous method. The\r\nparts are constructed at suitable points along the shore above the\r\nbridge, and for each is required the material for three bays. They are\r\nconstructed as follows:\r\n\r\nA ponton is moored bow and stern close to the shore, and five chess are\r\ntemporarily laid from the bank to its interior gunwale, for the\r\nconvenience of the pontoniers during the construction of the part.\r\n\r\nThe other two pontons are brought up in succession, and two bays are\r\nconstructed in the ordinary manner, except that six chess are omitted\r\nfrom the roadway at both ends. Twenty-six chess and seven balks are\r\nloaded on the parts thus formed, which is then pushed off and conducted\r\nto the line of up-stream anchors, where it casts its anchor and drops\r\ndown to its place in the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe first part is connected with the abutment bay by the pontoniers on\r\nshore, who construct one length of bridge flooring in the usual manner,\r\nto join the abutment ponton with the first ponton of the part.\r\n\r\nThe other parts are united as they come in position, by bays formed from\r\nthe balks and chess with which they are loaded.\r\n\r\nThe down-stream anchors are cast by separate pontons provided for the\r\npurpose; and it may sometimes be necessary to cast the up-stream anchors\r\nin the same way, as the parts are not easily managed in a rapid current.\r\n\r\nWhen the current is moderate, the parts may be constructed below as well\r\nas above the bridge.\r\n\r\n_By Rafts._--The abutment bay is laid in the same manner as in the last\r\nmethod, and the rafts differ from the parts only in having the roadway\r\ncompleted,--that is, the six chess at each end are not omitted. The\r\nrafts are not loaded with extra balks and chess, but are provided with\r\ntwo false balks, 6 feet 9 inches by 5 feet 5 inches, and with four\r\nrack-collars and wedges.\r\n\r\nThe rafts cast their up-stream anchors, and drop down to their places in\r\nthe bridge. The outer pontons of the adjacent rafts are in contact, and\r\nare lashed together bow and stern by their mooring-posts. False balks\r\nare laid over the side-rails of the two rafts at their junction; and two\r\nrack-collars embrace each false balk, and the side-rails and balks under\r\nthem. These collars are placed on each side, and 2 feet from, the\r\njunction of the side-rails. The wedges are driven between the false\r\nbalks and the tops of the collars.\r\n\r\n_By Conversion._--The position of the bridge having been determined, and\r\nthe width of the stream accurately measured, a suitable place at some\r\ndistance above the position of the abutment is selected for the\r\nconstruction of the bridge. This place may be at a considerable distance\r\nfrom that which the bridge is to occupy; it is frequently on some\r\ntributary of the stream to be bridged, out of sight of the enemy’s\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThe bridge is constructed parallel to the shore; side-rails are lashed\r\non all except the extreme bays. The balks, chess, etc., for the\r\nabutment bay on the enemy’s side, are embarked on the next to the last\r\nbay of the bridge; a ponton is lashed to the last ponton in the bridge;\r\nthis contains, in addition to the articles necessary for constructing\r\nthe abutment, two strong pickets. The up-stream anchors are deposited in\r\nthe bows of the boats on the wheeling flank, 10 or 15 yards of their\r\ncables coiled, the remainder stretched along the bridge. Two strong\r\nspring-lines are extended and lashed, the one over the bows, the other\r\nover the sterns of all the pontons; these lines should be considerably\r\nlonger than the bridge, and the ends coiled on the platform. The bridge\r\nis then allowed to float down to within 15 yards of the first abutment.\r\n\r\nThe material for the first abutment and bay is brought down in a ponton.\r\nTwo strong pickets are planted to receive the spring-lines and two to\r\nreceive the shore-lines, which are coiled on the platform between the\r\nfirst and second pontons.\r\n\r\nThe wheeling flank is pushed off, and men are stationed in the bow and\r\nstern of each ponton with oars and boat-hooks to increase or retard the\r\nprogress of their ponton, as may be necessary. A detachment is stationed\r\nat the first abutment to manœuvre the spring-lines; another to prevent\r\nthe pivot flank from touching shore; a turn of the shore-line is also\r\ntaken around the mooring-post of the ponton, and this line is eased off,\r\nas the case may require. The anchors are cast as the pontons in which\r\nthey are carried come in their proper places, and their cables are\r\nshifted to the pontons to which they are to be attached. The progress of\r\nthe bridge is checked when it arrives opposite the abutments, which\r\nshould be constructed during the conversion of the bridge, if the force\r\nbe strong enough.\r\n\r\nThe down-stream anchors are cast by the spare pontons, as in the bridge\r\nby successive pontons.\r\n\r\n_Flying Bridge._--This term is applied to any floating support anchored\r\nto a fixed point (usually in the stream), and driven from shore to shore\r\nby the oblique action of the current on its sides.\r\n\r\nAlthough these bridges do not afford a continuous communication, yet\r\nthey possess some decided advantages, viz.:\r\n\r\nThey are readily established, even over the most rapid streams.\r\n\r\nThey require but little material for their construction.\r\n\r\nThey may be worked by very few men.\r\n\r\nThey permit the passage of troops of all arms, and of the heaviest\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to and exit from them is easy.\r\n\r\nThey do not interrupt navigation; and they are not liable to be injured\r\nby floating bodies which, either by accident or design, are carried\r\ndown-stream by the current.\r\n\r\nThe current should not be less than one yard per second.\r\n\r\n_To Construct the Raft._--The raft is formed of six pontons. Two\r\npontons are lashed stern to stern, and to these a third, breaking\r\njoints. A second set similar to the above are placed at a distance from\r\nthe first of 26 feet from set to set. The two sets are connected by six\r\nbalks over which four courses are lashed. Then fifteen balks in a manner\r\nsuitable for receiving chess. The extreme chess are nailed down, and the\r\nouter courses secured by side-rails. The length of the cable should be\r\nat least one and a half times the width of the river. One, two, or three\r\nanchors are used, depending on the strength of the current. The cable is\r\nsupported by pontons. The boat nearest the anchor is the largest; the\r\ndistance between the boats should be such that the cable shall not touch\r\nthe water between the first boat and the raft; each boat is fitted with\r\na staging, composed of two short balks, and a supporting block, on which\r\nthe cable rests and to which it is lashed. The cable is also connected\r\nwith the bow of the boat by a line of such length that the boat is\r\nallowed to turn just enough to keep parallel with the raft. After the\r\nraft is attached to the cable it is passed from shore to shore once or\r\ntwice, using a stern veering-line if necessary, until the anchors are\r\nfirmly imbedded and the cable is stretched; the two abutments are then\r\nconstructed; these do not differ from the first bay of the ordinary\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nThe proper angle for the axis of the boat to make with the current is\r\nabout 55°. This angle is gradually increased on nearing the shore, until\r\nthe way of the raft is diminished sufficiently to prevent it from\r\nstriking the abutment with a shock.\r\n\r\n_Trail Bridges._--When the river is not more than 150 yards wide, a\r\nsheer-line may be used in place of the anchor and cable; the sheer-line\r\nmust be taut enough to keep above water.\r\n\r\nIf the banks are not high enough, the sheer-line should be elevated at\r\neach shore by passing it over a frame formed by three poles, arranged\r\nlike an artillery gin. Upon this line a pulley is fixed, so that it can\r\nrun freely from shore to shore; through the eye of the pulley-block a\r\nline is passed, one end of which is attached to the bow of the first,\r\nand the other to the bow of the second, boat forming the raft. The raft\r\nis manœuvred in the same manner as the flying bridge; or one end of a\r\nline may be made fast to the running-block on the sheer-line, while the\r\nother passes through a snatch-block near the stern of the raft on the\r\nup-stream side; by hauling in or letting out this line the proper\r\ndirection is given to the raft.\r\n\r\n_Rope-ferries._--The rope-ferry is used when the velocity of the current\r\nis not sufficient to propel the raft. It consists of a raft or flat,\r\nprovided with a standard near each end on the up-stream side. These\r\nstandards are forked on top to receive the sheer-line, which is\r\nstretched across the stream in the same manner as for the trail bridge.\r\nThe raft is propelled across the stream by men on its deck hauling on\r\nthe sheer-line.\r\n\r\n_Prairie Raft._--It frequently occurs in the Western country that\r\nexpeditions, unaccompanied by regular ponton-trains, are compelled to\r\ncross streams so situated that it is impossible to obtain timber or\r\nother material suitable for the construction of rafts or bridges. Under\r\nthese circumstances, a raft may be constructed of two canvas pontons, by\r\nmeans of which loaded wagons may readily be ferried over the stream. All\r\nthe material required for such a raft is easily carried in one\r\nponton-wagon. The construction is as follows: The wagon to be floated is\r\nbacked into the stream until the rear wheels stand in about one foot of\r\nwater. A canvas ponton is placed on each side of the wagon, parallel to\r\nand one foot from it. A balk is placed against the tail-board of the\r\nwagon, and resting upon the gunwales of the pontons. A second balk is\r\nsimilarly placed against the front-board of the wagon. On each side of\r\nthe wagon a strong rope is made fast to the front balk, passed under the\r\naxle-trees round the rear balk, and thence back to the starting-point,\r\nwhere it is made fast. The raft and wagon are pushed into the stream,\r\nand, as soon as the latter is clear of the bottom, the balks are lashed\r\nto the gunwales of the pontons. A line is attached to the wagon-pole,\r\nand coiled in the bow of one of the pontons. This raft may be conveyed\r\nacross the stream either by rowing, or in the manner of a trail bridge.\r\nOn approaching the opposite shore, it should be turned with the\r\nwagon-pole toward the bank. As soon as the wagon grounds, the balks are\r\nremoved and the wagon is drawn on shore by means of the rope attached to\r\nits pole. A single hinged canvas ponton, which is readily packed in an\r\nordinary quartermaster wagon, will suffice for the crossing, if the\r\nwagons are unloaded and taken apart.\r\n\r\n_Box Pontons._--In localities where plank and boards can be conveniently\r\nprocured, pontons may be constructed very expeditiously, by placing ten\r\npartitions of 2-inch plank, each 5 feet long, and 2¹⁄₂ inches high, in\r\nparallel positions, on the top and sides of which boards are nailed: the\r\nbox thus formed to be covered with pitched canvas, as described in the\r\nmode of constructing crib pontons.\r\n\r\n_Wagon-body Pontons._--Ordinary wagon-bodies, covered with pitched\r\ncanvas or india-rubber blankets, may be used either as boats or pontons.\r\nThe small capacity of the wagon-body requires such pontons to be placed\r\nmore closely to compensate for it.\r\n\r\n=Ponton-train.= See PONTONS, BRIDGE EQUIPAGE.\r\n\r\n=Pontus.= An ancient kingdom in the northeast of Asia Minor, which\r\nderived its name from its being on the _Pontus Euxinus_ (Black Sea),\r\nextending from the river Colchis in the east to the river Halys in the\r\nwest. In early times, its various parts were designated after the tribes\r\nwhich inhabited them. The most important of those tribes are,--the\r\nLeucosyri, Tibareni, Chalybes, Mosynœci, Heptacometæ, Drilæ, Bechires,\r\nByzeres, Colchi, Macrones, Mares, Taochi, and Phasiani. From the middle\r\nof the 7th century B.C., many of those tribes inhabiting the coast rose\r\nto great power and opulence, spreading Greek culture and civilization\r\naround them; while many of those of the interior were extremely savage\r\nand wild. According to tradition, it was conquered by Ninus, founder of\r\nthe Assyrian empire; and it was certainly under the Persian dominion\r\nafter the time of Cyrus the Great. In the reign of Artaxerxes II.,\r\nAriobarzanes conquered several of the Pontian tribes, and laid the\r\nfoundation of an independent kingdom. Mithridates II. succeeded him 337\r\nB.C., who by availing himself of the disputes of the successors of\r\nAlexander, considerably enlarged his dominions. Under Mithridates VI.,\r\nfrom 120 to 63 B.C., the kingdom of Pontus rose to its highest dignity.\r\nIn his war with the Romans his kingdom was dismembered by Pompey in 65\r\nB.C., who annexed the western part of the nation, and gave the remainder\r\nto the native chiefs. In 63 A.D. Pontus was made a Roman province, and\r\nin the changes which transpired under Constantine the province was\r\ndivided into two parts.\r\n\r\n=Pontvalent.= A kind of light bridge, used in sieges, for surprising a\r\npost or outwork which has but a narrow moat; a flying bridge.\r\n\r\n=Poor Knights of Windsor.= See KNIGHTS, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Port Royal.= In Beaufort Co., S. C., noted as one of the earliest\r\nsettlements made by the Spaniards within the present limits of the\r\nUnited States, and for important events during the war of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n=Portable Forge.= A light and compact blacksmith’s forge, with bellows,\r\netc., that may be moved from place to place; used frequently in the\r\nquartermaster’s department.\r\n\r\n=Portate.= In heraldry, borne not erect, but athwart an escutcheon; as,\r\na portate cross.\r\n\r\n=Portcullis.= Is an assemblage of several large pieces of wood, joined\r\nacross one another like a harrow, and each pointed with iron at the\r\nbottom. They are sometimes suspended over the gateway of old fortified\r\ntowns and castles, ready to be let down in the case of surprise, when\r\nthe gates cannot be shut.\r\n\r\n=Portcullis.= In heraldry, the portcullis is represented with rings at\r\nits uppermost angles, from which chains depend on either side. It was a\r\nbadge of the Beaufort family, and borne in virtue of their Beaufort\r\ndescent by their Tudor sovereigns. Portcullis is the title of one of the\r\npursuviants belonging to the English College of Arms, whose office was\r\ninstituted by Henry VII.\r\n\r\n=Port-fire.= See LABORATORY STORES.\r\n\r\n=Portfolio.= A portable case for keeping loose papers in. Hence, also,\r\nthe office and functions of a minister of state or member of the\r\ncabinet; as, to receive the portfolio of war.\r\n\r\n=Portglave.= An ancient name for a sword-bearer.\r\n\r\n=Portland Isle.= An island off the coast of Dorset, England, which was\r\nfortified before 1142.\r\n\r\n=Porto= (or =Puerto=) =Bello=. A seaport town of South America, on the\r\nnorth coast of the Isthmus of Darien.\r\n\r\n=Porto Novo.= A seaport of British India, in the Presidency of Madras,\r\nat the mouth of the Vellaur. It suffered severely in the wars of the\r\nBritish government against Mysore, and fell into a state of decay. At\r\nPorto Novo, Hyder Ali, with an immensely superior army, was totally\r\ndefeated by the British under Sir Eyre Coote in 1791.\r\n\r\n=Porto Rico.= A Spanish possession, one of the group of West India\r\nIslands called the Great Antilles. Porto Rico was invaded in 1509 by\r\nSpaniards from Hayti, and the natives were soon exterminated by them.\r\nTowards the end of the 17th century the island was captured by the\r\nBritish, but was abandoned by them soon afterwards. In 1820 a revolution\r\ntook place in Porto Rico, which was finally put down in 1823.\r\n\r\n=Portugal= (anc. _Lusitania_). A kingdom in the southwest of Europe,\r\nforming the western part of the Spanish peninsula. After nine years’\r\nstruggle, under Viriathes, a brave and able leader, the Lusitanians\r\nsubmitted to the Roman arms about 137 B.C. In the 5th century the Suevi,\r\nVandals, and Visigoths became possessors of the country. In the\r\nbeginning of the 8th century Portugal shared the fate of Spain, and was\r\noverrun by the Moors. After a long struggle, during which many battles\r\nwere fought, and many illustrious deeds achieved, the Portuguese\r\nmonarchy was formally established by the Cortes at Lamego in 1143, with\r\nAlfonso I. (of the Burgundian house) as king. The immediate successors\r\nof Alfonso I. were engaged in many severe struggles with the clergy, who\r\nwere always ready to combine against the sovereign; but on the whole,\r\nthe dignity of the kingdom was well maintained by the representatives of\r\nthis family, who are, moreover, distinguished as the promoters and\r\nupholders of the maritime glory of Portugal. Alfonso, surnamed “the\r\nBrave,” ascended the throne in 1325, and his reign was almost wholly\r\noccupied in wars with the Castilians and the Moslems. With his grandson,\r\nFerdinand I., the legitimate branch of the Burgundian house became\r\nextinct in 1383. During the reign of John II., the Azores, Madeira, Cape\r\nde Verde, and other islands were seized. The discovery of Brazil and the\r\nsettlements made there and on the western coast of India increased the\r\nmaritime power and fame of Portugal, which were further extended under\r\nJohn III., who ascended the throne in 1521, and during whose reign the\r\nInquisition was introduced. At this period Portugal ranked as one of the\r\nmost powerful monarchies in Europe. Sebastian (grandson of John III.),\r\nurged by the Jesuits, entered upon a fatal expedition to Africa against\r\nthe infidels. The defeat of the Portuguese, and the capture and death of\r\ntheir young king at the battle of Alcazar in 1578, and the extinction of\r\nthe old Burgundian line in 1580, plunged the country into difficulties\r\nand misfortunes of every kind. Philip II. of Spain succeeded in securing\r\nto himself the crown of Portugal, and annexing the Portuguese kingdom to\r\nthe Spanish monarchy. This event proved disastrous in the extreme to\r\nPortugal, involving it in all the ruinous wars of Spain in the Low\r\nCountries and in Germany, the greater part of the expenses of which it\r\nbore; while the Dutch, in retaliation for Spanish aggression at home,\r\nattacked the Portuguese settlements in Brazil, and almost completely\r\ndeprived them of their possessions in the Indian Archipelago. In 1640,\r\nafter a forced union of 160 years, Portugal was freed, by a bold and\r\nsuccessful conspiracy of the nobles, from all connection with Spain, and\r\nthe Duke de Braganza placed on the throne, under the title of John IV.\r\nThe war with Spain, which was the natural result of this act, terminated\r\nin 1668, when by the treaty of Lisbon, the independence of Portugal was\r\nformally recognized by the Spanish government. For the next hundred\r\nyears, Portugal vegetated in a state of inglorious apathy. It was\r\ninvaded by the French in 1807,--a measure which gave rise to the\r\nPeninsular war. The victory of Vimeira, gained by the combined English\r\nand Portuguese army in 1808, freed the land from its French assailants.\r\nA revolution broke out in Lisbon in 1820. In 1832, Dom Pedro raised a\r\nfleet and made a landing at Oporto. Admiral Napier in the mean while\r\noperated on the coast of Algarve successfully in favor of the young\r\nqueen Doña Maria de Gloria, whose cause, by these victories and the\r\nsupport of an alliance with the great powers, finally proved victorious.\r\nDoña Maria made her entry into Lisbon in 1833; and in the following year\r\nDom Miguel (who had disputed the throne) signed the convention of Evora,\r\nby which he renounced all pretensions to the throne. During the reign of\r\nDoña Maria insurrections and counter-insurrections were of frequent\r\noccurrence, the troops were not to be depended on in moments of\r\nemergency; guerrilla bands scoured the country at will, and openly\r\ndefied the queen’s authority. An armed intervention of the great powers\r\nin 1847 produced a partial abatement of the national disorders; but the\r\nqueen’s partiality for her unpopular ministers, Count Thomar and his\r\nbrother Cabral, led to the insurrection which, without bloodshed, made\r\nthe national idol, the Marquis de Saldanha, _de facto_ military dictator\r\nof Portugal. The eldest son of the queen ascended the throne in 1853, as\r\nPedro V., under the regency of the king-consort his father. The latter\r\nused his power discreetly, and the financial disorders were partially\r\nadjusted, and since that period the general condition of the nation is\r\nmore promising.\r\n\r\n=Positions, Military.= The sites occupied by armies, either for the\r\npurpose of covering and defending certain tracts of country, or\r\npreparatory to the commencement of offensive operations against an\r\nenemy. A position is considered as advantageously chosen when it is on\r\nelevated ground; when it is not commanded by eminences within the range\r\nof artillery; and when, from the existence of natural obstacles, as\r\nrivers or marshes, on the wings, it is incapable of being turned,--that\r\nis, the enemy cannot, without making an extensive movement, get to the\r\nrear of the army by which the position is occupied. In the event of such\r\npoints of support being wanting, the position, whether it be a plain or\r\nan eminence, should have its flanks protected by villages, or by\r\nredoubts raised for the purpose. A village, or even a single building,\r\non the ground occupied by the army, may become the key of the position;\r\nand as, not unfrequently, on the preservation of this point depends the\r\nfield of battle, such point should be well supported by troops and\r\nartillery. The highest point of ground, particularly if near the lines\r\nof operation, may also constitute the key, and is usually strengthened\r\nby one or more redoubts. Artillery should always be placed where it can\r\nact with the most effect; and when the ground occupied by an army\r\npresents alternately salient and retired points along the front of the\r\nline, the batteries should be placed at such points. Infantry may occupy\r\nany kind of ground, but should, if possible, always form a close line.\r\nIt is usually placed between the batteries; and if exposed to a distant\r\ncannonade, the troops may be drawn up in a trench, the earth from which\r\nwill serve to cover them without preventing them from marching out in\r\nline to meet the enemy. Cavalry must be posted on a level plain, over\r\nwhich it may advance with regularity when a charge is to be made; if\r\ncompelled to act on broken ground, it is formed in small detachments\r\nbehind the infantry, through whose intervals it may pass at proper\r\nopportunities. The power of readily appreciating the character of ground\r\nfor military purposes is what is called by foreign writers the military\r\n_coup d’œil_; and this can only be acquired by a profound knowledge of\r\nmilitary tactics of war, joined to much experience in the practice of\r\nexecuting military surveys, and of contemplating the appearance of\r\nground from all possible points of view.\r\n\r\n=Posse Comitatus.= A sheriff or marshal, for the purpose of keeping the\r\npeace and pursuing felons, may command all the people of his county\r\nabove fifteen years old to attend him, which is called the _posse\r\ncomitatus_, or “power of the county.”--_Blackstone._\r\n\r\n=Possession.= To take possession, is the act of occupying any post,\r\ncamp, fortress, etc., which might facilitate the operations of an army,\r\nor which previously belonged to the enemy.\r\n\r\n=Post.= Any sort of ground, fortified or not, where a body of men can be\r\nin a condition of resisting the enemy.\r\n\r\n_Advance post_, a spot of ground seized by a party to secure their\r\nfront, and the post behind them.\r\n\r\n_Post_ is also the walk or position of a sentinel.\r\n\r\n=Post.= In the British service, a bugle-sound. The first post is the\r\nbugling which precedes the tattoo; the last post that which follows it.\r\nAlso, the piece of ground to which a sentinel’s walk is limited; any\r\nplace or office assigned to a soldier or body of soldiers on duty.\r\n\r\n=Post, Abandoning a.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 42.\r\n\r\n=Post, Advantageous.= Every situation is so called which an enemy\r\noccupies in such a manner that not only mere force of arms, but great\r\nmilitary skill, and many stratagems, are required to dislodge him.\r\n\r\n=Post of Honor.= The advanced guard is a post of honor; the right of the\r\ntwo lines is the post of honor, and is generally given to the eldest\r\ncorps; the left is the next post, and given to the next eldest, and so\r\non. But the laws of military discipline forbid an inconvenient\r\naccordance with this practice, as the circumstances of the case may\r\nrequire a very different arrangement, which it would be wanton to\r\noppose.\r\n\r\n=Post, Sleeping Upon.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 39.\r\n\r\n=Post, To.= In a military sense, means to station; as, to post a\r\nsentinel. _To be posted_, in military tactics signifies to be formed\r\nready for action. Thus, when troops are brought up in column, and\r\nordered to deploy, it frequently happens that some part of the line is\r\nrefused, in order to flank an enemy, or to cover a weak position; the\r\npart that is aligned is said to be posted. To be posted also means, in a\r\nfamiliar sense, to be publicly announced as an infamous or degraded\r\ncharacter. Hence, to post a man as a coward is to stick his name up in a\r\nconspicuous place, and to accuse him of want of spirit, etc.\r\n\r\n=Postern=, or =Sally-port=. Is a passage usually vaulted, and\r\nconstructed under the rampart, to afford a communication from the\r\ninterior into the ditch. The passages from the covered way into the\r\ncountry are likewise called sally-ports, as they afford free egress and\r\ningress to troops engaged in making a sally or sortie.\r\n\r\n=Post-traders.= Traders are allowed in the American army at the rate of\r\none to each military camp or post, who have the exclusive privilege to\r\ntrade upon the military reserve to which they are appointed, and no\r\nother person will be allowed to trade or sell goods by sample or\r\notherwise, within the limits of the reserve, except producers of fresh\r\nfruit and vegetables, by permission of the post commander. Post-traders\r\nare selected for the appointment by a council of administration,\r\nconsisting of the three senior officers, next to the commanding officer,\r\non duty at the post, and upon the recommendation of these officers,\r\napproved by the post commander, are appointed by the Secretary of War.\r\nThe trader is authorized to keep on hand for sales to the troops,\r\narticles of wholesome food, such clothing as soldiers may be permitted\r\nto purchase, tobacco, blacking, etc., the prices to be regulated by the\r\ncouncil of administration. At remote military posts in the United\r\nStates, traders are authorized to keep on hand the necessary supplies\r\nfor sales to miners, settlers, and emigrants. See CANTEEN, and SUTLER.\r\n\r\n=Pot.= The paper cylinder forming the head of a signal-rocket and\r\ncontaining the decorations. To diminish the resistance of the air the\r\npot is surmounted by a paper cone.\r\n\r\n=Pot, Stink-.= See STINK-POT.\r\n\r\n=Potence= (_Fr._). Troops are ranged _en potence_ by breaking a straight\r\nline, and throwing a certain proportion of it, either forward or\r\nbackward, from the right or left, according to circumstances, for the\r\npurpose of securing that line. An army may be posted _en potence_ by\r\nmeans of a village, a river, or a wood.\r\n\r\n=Potent Counter-potent.= In heraldry, one of the heraldic furs, in which\r\nthe field is filled with crutch-shaped figures alternately of metal and\r\ncolor, those of opposite tinctures being placed base against base, and\r\npoint against point. The metal and colors are understood to be argent\r\nand azure, unless they be specifically blazoned otherwise. Potent\r\ncounter-potent is sometimes blazoned Vairycuppy.\r\n\r\n=Potent, Cross.= In heraldry, a cross crutch-shaped at each extremity.\r\nIt is also called a Jerusalem cross, from its occurrence in the insignia\r\nof the Christian kingdom of Jerusalem, which are, argent a cross potent\r\nbetween four crosslets or. This coat is remarkable as being a departure\r\nfrom the usual heraldic rule which prohibits the placing of metal upon\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n=Potentee.= A heraldic line of division which takes the form of the\r\noutline of a succession of crutch-shaped figures.\r\n\r\n=Potgun.= Formerly a short, wide cannon, formed like a pot.\r\n\r\n=Potidæa.= A town in Macedonia, on the narrow isthmus of the peninsula\r\nPallene, was a strongly fortified place, and one of considerable\r\nimportance. It was a colony of the Corinthians, and was founded before\r\nthe Persian wars. It afterwards became tributary to Athens, and its\r\nrevolt from the latter city in 432 B.C. was one of the immediate causes\r\nof the Peloponnesian war. It was taken by the Athenians in 429, after a\r\nsiege of more than two years, its inhabitants expelled, and their place\r\nsupplied by Athenian colonists. In 356 it was taken by Philip of\r\nMacedon, who destroyed the city, and sold the inhabitants into slavery.\r\nCassander, however, built a new city on the same site, to which he gave\r\nthe name of _Cassandria_, and which he peopled with the remains of the\r\nold population, and the inhabitants of the surrounding towns. It was\r\ntaken and plundered by the Huns, but was restored by Justinian.\r\n\r\n=Potomac.= A river of the United States, formed by two branches, which\r\nrise in the Alleghany Mountains, and unite 20 miles southeast of\r\nCumberland, Md., from which point the river flows in a generally\r\nsoutheasterly course, 400 miles, and falls into Chesapeake Bay, where it\r\nis 6 to 8 miles broad, 75 miles from the ocean. Line-of-battle ships\r\nascend to Washington, 120 miles from its mouth. The Potomac forms the\r\ngreater part of the boundary between Virginia and Maryland. During the\r\ncivil war, both Federal and Confederate armies crossed several times the\r\nfords of the Upper Potomac, and severe actions were fought upon its\r\nbanks. The largest army of the Union was named after it.\r\n\r\n=Pottawatomies.= A tribe of Indians of Algonkin stock, who formerly\r\noccupied a great part of Michigan, where a few still remain. They fought\r\nagainst the settlers in the Pontiac war, and against the Americans in\r\nthe war of the Revolution; and were allies of the British in the war of\r\n1812, soon after which they removed to Kansas, where they now reside in\r\na partial state of civilization, only about 500 of what is known as the\r\nPrairie band being located on a reservation.\r\n\r\n=Pouch.= A case of strong leather, lined with tin divisions, for the\r\npurpose of carrying a soldier’s ammunition. It is covered by a flap to\r\npreserve the cartridges from wet. The leather cases containing primers,\r\nlanyard, etc., in field and heavy artillery, and those containing a\r\ngunner’s level, vent-punch, gimlet, etc., in heavy artillery, are also\r\ncalled pouches.\r\n\r\n=Pounder.= The term used in describing the force of a cannon employed in\r\nfiring solid shot; as, a 9-pounder field-gun, a 300-pounder Armstrong,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Powder.= See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Powder-cart.= A two-wheeled carriage covered with an angular roof of\r\nboards. To prevent the powder from getting damp, a tarred canvas is put\r\nover the roof; and on each side are lockers to hold shot, in proportion\r\nto the quantity of powder.\r\n\r\n=Powdered=, or =Semée=. In heraldry, strewn with an indefinite number of\r\nsmall charges.\r\n\r\n=Powder-magazine.= See MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n=Powder-measure.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Powder-mill.= See MILL, GUNPOWDER-.\r\n\r\n=Power.= In military affairs as well as in all others, is knowledge--of\r\nhuman passions--of arms--of distance--of the skill and numbers of an\r\nenemy. To be in the _power_ of an enemy, is to have taken up,\r\ninjudiciously, such a position as to expose you to a defeat whenever the\r\nenemy may think proper to attack you.\r\n\r\n=Powerful.= Full of power; capable of producing great effects of any\r\nkind; as, a powerful army or navy.\r\n\r\n=Powldron.= In heraldry, that part of armor which covers the shoulders.\r\n\r\n=Powwow.= A priest or conjurer among the North American Indians. Also\r\nconjurations performed for the cure of diseases and other purposes,\r\nattended with great noise and confusion, and often with dancing.\r\n\r\n=Poynado.= A poniard was formerly so called.\r\n\r\n=Pozzuoli.= A city of Southern Italy, at the east of the Bay of Naples.\r\nIt is first mentioned in history during the second Punic war, when it\r\nwas surrounded by strong walls. In 214 B.C. it repulsed Hannibal, and\r\nsubsequently became a place of importance. It was destroyed by Alaric,\r\nGenseric, and Totila. It was afterwards rebuilt by the Byzantine Greeks,\r\nbut being exposed to new devastations, to earthquakes, and volcanic\r\neruptions, it sank into decay.\r\n\r\n=Practicable.= A word frequently used in military matters to express the\r\npossible accomplishment of any object. Hence, a practicable breach.\r\n\r\n=Practice, To.= In a military sense, to go through the manual and\r\nplatoon exercises, or through the various manœuvres, etc., for the\r\npurpose of becoming thoroughly master of military movements. Practice is\r\nlikewise used to signify the act of effecting or executing any military\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n=Præliares.= Among the Romans, fighting days, on which they thought it\r\nlawful to engage in acts of hostility; for during the time of some\r\nparticular feasts, they reckoned it a piece of impiety to raise, march,\r\nor exercise men for war, or to encounter the enemy, unless first\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\n=Prætorians.= Was, during the Roman republic, a select cohort that\r\nattended the prætor or commander of an army. They frequently decided the\r\nfate of battles. After the overthrow of the republic, Augustus formed\r\nthem into nine cohorts, and fixed their station in the capital as\r\nbody-guards. They became, in short, under the emperors, what “the\r\nguards” are to the monarchies of Europe. They, in addition to their\r\nmilitary duties, frequently had the charge of state prisoners, and often\r\nacted the part of executioners. They were all picked men, chosen for the\r\nmost part from Italy. Their power increased greatly under the empire\r\nuntil they frequently determined the fate of an emperor. Diocletian\r\nreduced their number, and Constantine disbanded them.\r\n\r\n=Prætorium.= See PRETORIUM.\r\n\r\n=Praga.= A town of Poland, on the Vistula, opposite to Warsaw, with\r\nwhich it communicates by a bridge of boats. In 1794 the Polish\r\ninsurgents took refuge here, and it was stormed by Suwarrow, and given\r\nup to pillage and massacre, when about 20,000 were slain. In 1830 the\r\nGrand Duke Constantine of Russia was forced to retreat from this town\r\nwith his troops, at the beginning of the Polish revolution in that year,\r\nwhich unfortunately proved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n=Prague.= A city of Austria, the capital of Bohemia, situated on the\r\nMoldau. Prague was conquered and almost destroyed by the Hussites in\r\n1424; but after the subsequent defeat and submission of the Hussites,\r\nthe city was rebuilt. In the Thirty Years’ War it suffered severely, and\r\nin 1620 the battle was fought at the White Mountain, near the city, in\r\nwhich Frederick V. (the “Winter King”), son-in-law of James I. of\r\nEngland, was completely defeated, and compelled to renounce his assumed\r\ncrown, and to give up the town into the power of the emperor of Austria.\r\nSwedes and Imperialists successively gained possession of it during the\r\nwar; and a century later, during the Seven Years’ War, it again fell\r\ninto the hands of different victors, being compelled, in 1744, to\r\ncapitulate to Frederick the Great of Prussia; but he was obliged to\r\nabandon it the same year. In 1757 the king of Prussia again besieged it,\r\nbut his efforts to reduce it proved ineffectual. In 1848 it was\r\nbombarded, the inhabitants having risen against the Austrian government,\r\nwhen great cruelties were perpetrated by the Austrian troops. A treaty\r\nof peace between Austria and Prussia was signed at Prague, August 23,\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n=Praguerie, War of= (so named from Prague, then celebrated for its civil\r\ndisorders). Was the name given to the revolt of the dauphin, afterwards\r\nLouis XI., against his father, Charles VII., aided by Alexander, the\r\nbastard, of Bourbon, and other nobles. It was soon quelled; Louis was\r\nexiled, and Alexander put to death by drowning, July, 1440.\r\n\r\n=Prairie Raft.= See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Prairie-carriage.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Prance.= To spring or bound, as a horse in high mettle. To walk or\r\nstrut about in a showy manner, or with warlike parade.\r\n\r\n=Precedence.= Priority in rank or precedence in military life, is\r\nregulated by the date of an officer’s commission, or the standing in the\r\ncorps to which he may belong.\r\n\r\n=Precedent.= Any act which can be interpreted into an example for future\r\ntimes, is called a precedent. Persons in high office are extremely\r\nscrupulous with respect to precedents, especially in military matters.\r\n\r\n=Precision.= Exact limitation, scrupulous observance of certain given\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n=Predal=, or =Predatory War=. A war carried on by plunder and rapine.\r\n\r\n=Prefect= (Lat. _præfectus_). A Roman officer who was over, or who\r\nsuperintended, a particular command, charge, department, and the like.\r\nOf this class there were several, as the prefect of a camp, of a fleet,\r\nof the city guards, etc.\r\n\r\n=Prefect Pretorian.= In Roman antiquity, was the commander of the\r\npretorian guards.\r\n\r\n=Preferment.= The state of being advanced to a higher post.\r\n\r\n=Prejudice.= An opinion or decision of mind formed without due\r\nexamination; prejudgment; a bias or leaning toward one side or the other\r\nof a question from other considerations than those belonging to it; an\r\nunreasonable predilection or prepossession for or against anything;\r\nespecially, an opinion or leaning adverse to anything formed without\r\nproper grounds, or before suitable knowledge.\r\n\r\n=Prejudicial to Military Discipline, Conduct.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF\r\nWAR, 62.\r\n\r\n=Prenzlow.= A town of Prussia, in the province of Brandenburg, 71 miles\r\nnorth-northeast from Berlin. Here, in October, 1806, a body of\r\nPrussians, 10,000 strong, under the Prince of Hohenlohe, surrendered,\r\nafter the defeat of Jena, to the French under Murat.\r\n\r\n=Prepare for Action.= A word of command used in the artillery.\r\n\r\n=Preponderance.= In gunnery, is the excess of weight of the part in rear\r\nof the trunnions over that in front; it is measured by the lifting force\r\nin pounds, which must be applied at the rear of the base-ring, at the\r\nbase-line, or at the bottom of the ratchet, to balance the piece when\r\nsuspended freely on the axis of the trunnions. Preponderance was given\r\nto prevent the sudden dipping of the muzzle, in firing, and violent\r\nconcussion on the carriage at the breech. Most of the heavy pieces of\r\nthe late models have no preponderance, the axis of the trunnions\r\nintersecting the axis of the piece, at the centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n=Presburg.= A town of Hungary, situated on the Danube, 36 miles east\r\nfrom Vienna. This town was once the capital of Hungary, and the emperors\r\nof Austria are still crowned here as kings of Hungary. It is noted for\r\nthe treaty concluded there between France and Austria in 1805, when the\r\nTyrol was given to Bavaria, and Venice to the French.\r\n\r\n=Prescott= (Upper Canada). On November 17, 1838, the Canadian rebels\r\nwere attacked by the British under Maj. Young, and (on the 18th) by\r\nLieut.-Col. Dundas, who dispersed the insurgents, several of whom were\r\nkilled, and many taken prisoners, the remainder surrendering. The troops\r\nalso suffered considerably.\r\n\r\n=Presence of Mind.= Ready conceptions of expedient, producing\r\npromptitude of action under difficult and alarming circumstances. A\r\nquality indispensable in a general.\r\n\r\n=Present.= In the British service, means to level; to aim; to bring the\r\nmusket to a horizontal position, the butt resting against the right\r\nshoulder for the purpose of discharging its contents at a given object.\r\n\r\n=Present.= To offer openly; to exhibit; to give in ceremony; as, to\r\npresent the colors.\r\n\r\n=Present Arms, To.= In tactics is to bring the musket to a certain\r\nprescribed position, for the purpose of paying a military compliment.\r\n\r\n=Preservation of Cannon and Ammunition.= See LACKER.\r\n\r\n=President.= The President of the United States is commander-in-chief of\r\nthe army, navy, and militia, called into service. His functions as such\r\nare assigned by Congress, but embrace of course whatever authority may\r\nbe assigned to any military commander, on the principle that the\r\nauthority of the greater includes that of the less. For the command,\r\ngovernment, and regulation of the army, however, Congress has created a\r\nmilitary hierarchy or range of subordination in the army with rights and\r\nduties regulated by Congress, and the commander-in-chief cannot make use\r\nof any other agents in exercising his command; and all orders issued by\r\nhim must be according to the rules and articles made by Congress for the\r\ngovernment of the army. In his capacity of chief magistrate of the\r\nUnion, Congress has also invested the President with many administrative\r\nfunctions relating to military affairs; and for the performance of the\r\nlatter duties the secretary of the department of war has been made his\r\nminister, upon matters connected with _matériel_, accounts, returns, the\r\nsupport of troops, and the raising of troops.\r\n\r\n=President.= The president of a court-martial is the senior member. He\r\npreserves order in court; administers the oath taken by the\r\njudge-advocate, and the proceedings of the court are authenticated by\r\nhis signature and that of the judge-advocate.\r\n\r\n=Presidio= (_Sp._). A place of defense; a garrison or guard-house.\r\n\r\n=Pressure-gauge.= Called also _pressure-plug_. An apparatus invented by\r\nGen. Rodman for measuring the pressure exerted by the gases of exploded\r\npowder. It consists essentially of a steel plunger, on the head of which\r\nthe pressure is exerted. The other end of the plunger is widened out\r\ninto two cutting edges which meet at an obtuse angle. This point rests\r\non a disk of copper, into which the cutter is driven by the pressure.\r\nThe pressure is deduced from the length of the cut. Two forms of the\r\ninstrument are used,--one is placed in a hole bored through the side of\r\nthe gun. The other is complete in itself and is placed at the bottom of\r\nthe cartridge-bag. Lieut. Metcalfe’s (U. S. Ordnance Corps) modification\r\nof the pressure-gauge has a cutter with a helicoidal edge. To measure\r\nthe cut he uses a circular scale with a hole in the centre (in which the\r\ninducted copper is placed), and a radial arm to show the extent of the\r\nspiral cut. The English modification of Rodman’s instrument is called\r\nthe _crusher-gauge_,--a short cylinder of copper is substituted for the\r\ndisk,--the reduction in its length gives a measure of the pressure. The\r\ncrusher-gauge is frequently attached to the base of the shot. A similar\r\nmodification is used to test the power of the high explosives, such as\r\ndynamite, dualin, etc. A lead cylinder is crushed in this case. A very\r\nsmall charge is used. The reaction is obtained by placing a heavy\r\ncylindrical shot over the charge, which rests directly in a cavity on\r\nthe top of the plunger.\r\n\r\n=Preston.= A town of England, in Lancashire, on the north bank of the\r\nRibble. This town was partially destroyed by Bruce in 1322; and after\r\ndeclaring for the king, it was taken by the forces of the Parliament\r\nunder Gen. Fairfax. Here also ended the ill-fated Jacobite rising of\r\n1715, when, after a brave resistance, the insurgents were compelled to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\n=Prestonpans.= A village of Haddingtonshire, 8 miles east of Edinburgh.\r\nIn the vicinity, on September 21, 1745, was fought the famous battle of\r\nPrestonpans, between the royal troops under Sir John Cope and the\r\nJacobites under Prince Charles, in which the latter, with a loss of only\r\nabout 10 officers and 120 men in killed and wounded, routed the royal\r\nforces with great slaughter, and captured their cannon, baggage, and\r\nmilitary chest.\r\n\r\n=Pretence, Escutcheon of=, or =Escutcheon Surtout=. In heraldry, a small\r\nshield placed in the centre of the field of another shield. The husband\r\nof an heiress may bear the arms of his wife in an escutcheon of\r\npretence, instead of impaling them. Feudal arms are also sometimes\r\nplaced on an escutcheon of pretence, particularly in the insignia of\r\nelective sovereigns, who have been in use of bearing their own proper\r\narms in surtout over those of the dominions to which they are entitled.\r\n\r\n=Pretorian.= Appertaining to pretor; also the general’s guard among the\r\nancient Romans.\r\n\r\n=Pretorium.= The hall or court where the pretor lived and administered\r\njustice. It also denoted the tent of the Roman general, in which\r\ncouncils of war were held. The place where the pretorian guards were\r\nquartered or lodged, was likewise called pretorium.\r\n\r\n=Prevesa.= A fortified town of European Turkey, in Albania, on the north\r\nshore of the Gulf of Arta, 58 miles south-southwest of Yanina. Prevesa\r\nbelonged to the Venetians from 1684 until the fall of that republic in\r\n1797. It was then held by the French for a time, but was afterwards\r\ntaken by the Turks.\r\n\r\n=Prey.= Anything, as goods, etc., taken by force from an enemy in war;\r\nspoil; booty; plunder.\r\n\r\n=Pricker.= A light horseman was formerly so called.\r\n\r\n=Pricker.= A priming-wire (which see).\r\n\r\n=Pride.= In heraldry, a peacock or other bird, when the tail is spread\r\nout in a circular form, and the wings drooped, is said to be “in his\r\npride.”\r\n\r\n=Priest-cap.= In fortification, a work so named from its shape; called\r\nalso _swallow-tail_. See REDAN.\r\n\r\n=Prime.= To charge with the powder, percussion-cap, or other device for\r\ncommunicating fire to the charge, as a fire-arm.\r\n\r\n=Primer.= A wafer, cap, tube, or other device for communicating fire to\r\nthe charge of powder in a cannon. The cap or tube usually contains a\r\nfriction- or percussion-powder. The _friction-primer_ is generally used\r\nin the land service. (See FRICTION-PRIMER.) For service on shipboard, a\r\nquill filled with rifle-powder, having on the top a capsule of fulminate\r\nof mercury, is generally employed. The capsule is exploded by a blow\r\nfrom the lock-hammer. The _tape-primer_, used sometimes in blasting, is\r\nformed of long, flexible strips of paper or fabric containing fulminate\r\nor other quick-burning substance. The _electric primer_ is used to fire\r\nsimultaneous discharges, both in ordnance and blasting. In firing wet\r\ngun-cotton, the small charge of dry gun-cotton used in conjunction with\r\nthe _detonating exploder_ is called a _primer_. In _small-arms_ the term\r\nis specially applied, at the present time, to the percussion-caps used\r\nin reloading metallic cartridge-cases. The cap is set in a recess in the\r\nhead of the shell. When the firing-pin strikes the outside end of the\r\ncap, the fulminate is exploded by being driven against a perforated cone\r\ncalled the _anvil_. This _anvil_ is usually a part of the shell. In the\r\n_Winchester primer_, recently invented, the anvil is a part of the\r\nprimer itself, being inserted upon the fulminate. A shoulder in the\r\nrecess holds the anvil when the cap is struck.\r\n\r\n=Priming.= The powder, percussion-cap, or other device used to\r\ncommunicate fire to the charge in a fire-arm.\r\n\r\n=Priming-tubes.= See LABORATORY STORES.\r\n\r\n=Priming-wire.= A pointed wire, used to penetrate the vent of a piece,\r\nfor examining the powder of the charge, or for piercing the cartridge.\r\n\r\n=Primipilarii=, =Primopilarii=, or =Primipilares=. Among the Romans,\r\nwere such as had formerly borne the office of primipulus of a legion.\r\nThe banner was intrusted to his care. Among other privileges which the\r\nprimipilarii enjoyed, they became heirs to what little property was left\r\nby the soldiers who died in the campaign.\r\n\r\n=Primipilus.= The centurion belonging to the first cohort of a legion.\r\nHe had charge of the Roman eagle.\r\n\r\n=Princeton.= A town of Mercer Co., N. J., about 40 miles northeast of\r\nPhiladelphia. This place was the scene of an important engagement during\r\nthe Revolutionary struggle, although the numbers engaged were\r\ncomparatively small. On hearing of the English reverse at Trenton (which\r\nsee), Gen. Howe immediately ordered Cornwallis, who was in New York, to\r\nproceed with his forces to Princeton. Leaving a part of his troops at\r\nthis place, he proceeded towards Trenton with the intention of giving\r\nbattle to the Americans, and arrived with his vanguard on January 1,\r\n1777. Washington, learning that only three regiments were left at\r\nPrinceton, by a circuitous night march arrived there by daybreak of\r\nJanuary 3, surprised and completely routed the enemy with a loss of 200\r\nkilled and wounded, and as many prisoners. The American loss did not\r\nexceed 30. This event greatly aroused the drooping spirits of the\r\ncolonists, who had been previously disheartened by a series of reverses.\r\n\r\n=Principes.= In the Roman armies, were the infantry, who formed the\r\nsecond line in the order of battle. They were armed like the _hastati_,\r\nwith this difference, that the former had half-pikes instead of whole\r\nones.\r\n\r\n=Principles, Military.= The basis or ground-work upon which every\r\nmilitary movement is made, and by which every operation is conducted.\r\n\r\n=Prismatic Compass.= A surveying instrument, much used on account of its\r\nconvenient size and form in military sketching, and for filling up the\r\ndetails of a map where great accuracy is not required.\r\n\r\n=Prismatic Powder.= See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Prisoners.= Are persons under arrest or in custody, whether in prison\r\nor not. Whenever any officer is charged with a crime, he is to be\r\narrested and deprived of his sword by the commanding officer; and\r\nsoldiers charged with crimes are to be confined until tried by a\r\ncourt-martial, or released by proper authority. (See APPENDIX, ARTICLES\r\nOF WAR, 65 and 66.) When brought into court, a prisoner should\r\nbe without irons, or any manner of shackles or bands, unless\r\nthere is danger of an escape, and then he may be secured with\r\nirons.--_Blackstone._\r\n\r\n=Prisoners of War.= Are soldiers captured during an engagement, siege,\r\nor continuance of hostilities, who are deprived of their liberty until\r\nregularly exchanged.\r\n\r\n=Prisons, Military.= Are buildings constructed for the retention of\r\nprisoners of war, or for the safe-keeping and punishment of offenders\r\nagainst military law. Sometimes during war forts and other strong\r\nbuildings are utilized for these purposes. The following were noted\r\nprisons during the civil war, 1861-65, for the retention of Federal\r\nprisoners of war:\r\n\r\n_Andersonville_ (which see).\r\n\r\n_Belle Isle._--An island in the James River near the city of Richmond,\r\nVa. The unfortunate prisoners taken were placed on this island without\r\nshelter of any kind to protect them from the scorching rays of the sun\r\nduring the day or the chilly cold mists of the night, until death or\r\nexchange released them from their sufferings.\r\n\r\n_Castle Thunder._--A fort in Charleston harbor, S. C., which was used\r\nfor the same purpose.\r\n\r\n_Libby._--An old tobacco warehouse in Richmond, Va., which was\r\ntemporarily converted into a military prison; and for cruelty and\r\ntorture to the Union prisoners this place was second only to\r\nAndersonville.\r\n\r\n_Salisbury._--A town in North Carolina, which had another depot for\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nThere were also prisons established for the retention of Confederate\r\nprisoners at Camp Douglas, Chicago, Camp Chase, Ohio, Elmira, N. Y.,\r\nPoint Lookout, Md., and Rock Island, Ill.\r\n\r\nAt _Fort Leavenworth_, Kansas, a permanent military prison was\r\nestablished in accordance with an act of Congress passed March 3, 1873,\r\nin which soldiers of the U. S. army are confined for serious offenses\r\nagainst military law.\r\n\r\nAt _Dartmoor_, a desolate region in England, a prison was constructed in\r\n1809 for the confinement of French prisoners of war which deserves a\r\npassing notice, inasmuch as Americans were confined there during the war\r\nof 1812. It comprised 30 acres, inclosed with double walls, with seven\r\ndistinct prison-houses with inclosures. In 1812 there were 6000 American\r\nprisoners of war within its walls who were treated with much cruelty,\r\nand, in consequence of the appearance of mutinous intentions of some of\r\nthe prisoners on account of the tardiness of the English officials in\r\nreleasing them after the treaty of peace was ratified, they were fired\r\nupon by the English soldiers, which resulted in the killing of 5 and\r\nwounding of 33 prisoners. This act was regarded in America as a wanton\r\nmassacre.\r\n\r\n=Privas.= A town of France, capital of the department of Ardèche, 26\r\nmiles southwest from Valence. In the civil wars of the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies in France, Privas, which was then a strongly-fortified town,\r\nplayed a conspicuous part, being always favorable to the Protestant\r\nparty. In 1629 it was bravely defended by a small garrison under St.\r\nAndré de Montbrun against Louis XIII., but after a siege of two months\r\nhad to be abandoned. Montbrun being soon afterwards taken was hanged,\r\nand the fortifications of Privas were leveled to the ground.\r\n\r\n=Private.= The title applied in the British army to a common soldier of\r\nthe cavalry and infantry; the corresponding rank in the artillery being\r\ngunner or driver, and in the engineers, the sapper. A private in the\r\ncavalry is sometimes called a trooper. In the U. S. army all the\r\nsoldiers who are below the grade of non-commissioned officers are called\r\nprivates.\r\n\r\n=Privy-coat.= A light coat or defense of mail, concealed under the\r\nordinary dress.\r\n\r\n=Prize.= That which is taken from another; a thing seized by force,\r\nstratagem, or superior power. Hence, specifically, anything captured by\r\na belligerent using the right of war.\r\n\r\n=Prize.= The application of a lever to move any weighty body, as a cask,\r\ncannon, or the like.\r\n\r\n=Prize Agent.= In the British service, a person appointed for the\r\ndistribution of such shares of money as may become due to officers and\r\nsoldiers after battle, siege, or capture.\r\n\r\n=Prize-bolt.= A manœuvring-bolt of a mortar-bed.\r\n\r\n=Prize-money.= The proportion which is paid to the troops who are\r\npresent at the capture or surrender of a place, etc., which yields\r\nbooty.\r\n\r\n=Prizing.= The same as _prize_, which see.\r\n\r\n=Proclamation.= The act of publishing abroad; conspicuous announcements;\r\nofficial or general notice; publication; that which is put forth by way\r\nof public notice; an official public announcement or declaration; a\r\npublished ordinance; as, the proclamation of a king. A proclamation may\r\nbe issued to declare the intention of the head of a government to\r\nexercise some prerogative or enforce some law which has for a long time\r\nbeen dormant or suspended. In time of war, the head of the government by\r\na proclamation may lay an embargo on shipping, and order the ports to be\r\nshut. But the most usual class of proclamations are admonitory notices\r\nfor the prevention of offenses, consisting of formal declarations of\r\nexisting laws and penalties, and of the intention to enforce them.\r\nProclamations are only binding when they do not contradict existing\r\nlaws, or tend to establish new ones, but only enforce the execution of\r\nthose which are already in being, in such manner as the head of the\r\ngovernment judges necessary.\r\n\r\n=Proconsul.= In Roman antiquity, an officer who discharged the duties of\r\na consul without being himself consul; a governor of a province, or a\r\nmilitary commander under a governor. He was usually one who had\r\npreviously been consul, and his power was nearly equal to that of a\r\nregular consul.\r\n\r\n=Prodd.= A cross-bow, used for throwing bullets in ancient times.\r\n\r\n=Profile.= A section of a parapet or other work in fortification.\r\n\r\n=Projectile.= A body projected or impelled forward by force, especially\r\nthrough the air. In a limited military sense the term is applied to a\r\nbody intended to be projected from a cannon by the force of gunpowder,\r\nor other explosive agent, to reach, strike, pass through, or destroy a\r\ndistant object. The materials of which projectiles are usually composed\r\nare lead, wrought or cast iron, each possessing advantages according to\r\nthe circumstances under which they are fired. But the material which\r\ncombines in a greater degree than any other the essential qualities of\r\nhardness, strength, density, and cheapness, is cast iron, which is\r\nexclusively used in the U. S. service for large projectiles. Compound\r\nprojectiles are sometimes made, so as to combine the good and correct\r\nthe bad qualities of different metals. To obviate the serious results\r\nthat may arise from the wedging of the flanges of a cast-iron projectile\r\nin the grooves of a rifle-cannon, it is frequently covered with a\r\ncoating of lead or other soft metal. Cast and wrought iron have also\r\nbeen combined with success, and also cast iron and soft metal in such a\r\nmanner as to attain the strength of one metal and the softness and\r\nexpansibility of the other. Other metals, such as brass, are also used\r\nin projectiles of special construction. Projectiles are generally\r\nclassified, according to their form, into spherical, or smooth-bore, and\r\noblong, or rifle projectiles.\r\n\r\n_Spherical Projectiles_ are fired mainly from smooth-bore guns. They are\r\nsolid shot, shells, spherical case or shrapnel, grape, canister,\r\ncarcasses, grenades, light- and fire-balls. The advantages which they\r\npossess over the oblong are their uniformity of resistance to the air,\r\npresenting the least extent of surface for a given weight, the\r\ncoincidence of their centres of form and inertia; they are less liable\r\nto wedge in the bore, as they touch the surface at only one point; and\r\nthey are best adapted for rolling and ricochet fire on account of the\r\nregularity of their rebounds. Solid shot are usually made of cast iron,\r\nand are designated by the diameter of the bore of the piece in which\r\nthey are to be used, or by their weight. Shells are cast with a core of\r\nsand (greater or less according to the thickness required), which is\r\nafterwards removed. The mortar-shell has the thinnest walls, and\r\ncontains the greatest bursting charge for the same caliber; the\r\ngun-shell is thicker, and the battering-shell is nearly as strong as the\r\nsolid shot. Shells are usually designated by the weight of the solid\r\nshot of the same diameter.\r\n\r\n_Oblong Projectiles_ are fired principally from rifled pieces, and have\r\nbeen adopted on account of the increase of range and accuracy which can\r\nbe obtained with them. For this purpose it is necessary that the\r\nprojectile should move through the air in the direction of its length.\r\nThough experience would seem to show that the only sure method of\r\neffecting this is to give it a rapid rotary motion round its axis by the\r\ngrooves of the rifle, numerous trials have been and are now being made\r\nto produce the same effect with smooth-bored guns. One of the simplest\r\nplans for this purpose is to place the centre of gravity or inertia in\r\nadvance of the centre of figure. Another is to make the projectile very\r\nlong, with its rear portion of wood, and its point of lead or iron,\r\nsomewhat after the manner of an arrow; but these plans do not seem to be\r\nof much practical utility. The system by which the desired result is\r\nobtained with the greatest certainty is the rifle system.\r\n\r\n_Rifle System._--Spiral grooves are cut into the bore of the piece, or\r\nit is ribbed with spiral bands, and the projectile is so formed or\r\nprepared as to follow them as it passes along the bore of the piece. The\r\nprincipal question which now occupies the attention of those engaged in\r\nimproving this species of cannon is to obtain the safest and surest\r\nmeans of effecting this object. Various plans have been tried to obtain\r\nthe proposed object; nearly all may be ranged under the following heads:\r\n\r\n1. _The Flanged System._--This comprises all projectiles which have\r\ncertain flanges or projections to fit into the grooves of the gun in\r\nloading. These are usually deep and few in number, rounded at their\r\nbottom edges so as to cause the flanges or studs to pass up the\r\ninclined side when rotation is imparted. This is the system at present\r\nadopted in England. Though this plan affords a certain means of\r\ncommunicating the rifle motion, it has not always been found a safe one,\r\nprobably from the wedging of the flanges in the grooves. Besides, the\r\ndirt from the burning of the powder collects in the grooves; and as it\r\nis difficult to clean them by the usual means, the projectile is liable\r\nto meet with obstruction in loading. To obviate these difficulties, the\r\nflanges are sometimes made of softer metal than the body of the\r\nprojectile. Guns for flanged or studded projectiles usually have from 3\r\nto 9 grooves, 0.15 to 0.25 inch deep.\r\n\r\n2. _The Compressive System._--By this system the projectile is forced by\r\nthe action of the powder through the bore of a piece whose diameter\r\nwithout the grooves is less than the diameter of the projectile. Such\r\nare the projectiles for the breech-loading Krupp and Broadwell guns.\r\nThese usually consist of cast iron or steel, and are covered with a\r\ncoating of lead or other soft metal having horizontal ribs or\r\ncorrugations, which is secured by a chemical solder, or cast into\r\nundercuts in the body of the shot. As the projectile is forced through\r\nthe bore, an impression of the rifling is cut out of the ribs, the lead\r\nthus displaced finding room in the grooves between. This system has been\r\nfound to work satisfactorily in breech-loading guns. The rifling should\r\nbe shallow and consist of numerous grooves, slightly narrowing towards\r\nthe muzzle. Large guns usually have from 20 to 76, from .05 to .08 inch\r\ndeep. Experiments are now being made, with prospects of success, to\r\nsubstitute bands of soft copper encircling the projectile for the lead\r\ncoating.\r\n\r\n3. _The Expansive System._--This system has been so exclusively used in\r\nthe United States that it has frequently been called the American\r\nsystem. It embraces all projectiles which are loaded without regard to\r\nthe rifling, but which are fitted with an expanding portion of some\r\nsofter metal, as pewter, copper, wrought iron, or _papier-maché_, which\r\nis forced into the grooves by the discharge. This system requires for\r\nits rifling fewer grooves than the compressive, but a somewhat greater\r\nnumber than the flanged system. Among the projectiles of this class used\r\nduring the civil war were the Blakely, Dyer, Hotchkiss, James, Parrott,\r\nReed, Schenkle, and Stafford. The principal objections to an expanding\r\nor compound projectile are its want of strength to resist a charge of\r\npowder proportionately as large as that employed for a simple\r\nprojectile, and the danger of its breaking and wedging in the bore of\r\nthe piece. Of late years, however, marked improvements have been made,\r\nand projectiles of this class can now be safely fired with double their\r\nformer charges. The large projectiles of this description now used in\r\nthe United States consist of the usual cast-iron body having a sabot,\r\nor ring of brass or copper either cast or screwed to its base. This ring\r\nis divided into an upper and lower flange or lip by an annular groove.\r\nWhen the gun is fired, the gases enter this groove, forcing the lower\r\nflange down upon the projectile and the upper or outer into the rifling\r\nof the gun, where it is kept during its passage through the bore.\r\n\r\n_Armstrong Projectile._--But one kind of projectile is used in the\r\nArmstrong breech-loading guns for the field service, and this is so\r\nconstructed as to act as a shot, shell, or case-shot at pleasure. It\r\nconsists of a very thin cast-iron shell, inclosing 42 segment-shaped\r\npieces of cast iron built up so as to form a cylindrical cavity in the\r\ncentre, which contains the bursting charge and the concussion-fuze. The\r\nexterior of the shell is thinly coated with lead, which is applied by\r\nplacing the shell in a mold and pouring it in a melted state. The lead\r\nis also allowed to percolate among the segments, so as to fill up the\r\ninterstices, the central cavity being kept open by the insertion of a\r\nsteel core. In this state the projectile is so compact that it may be\r\nfired without injury, while its resistance to a bursting charge is so\r\nsmall that less than one ounce of powder is required to burst it. When\r\nthe projectile is to be tired as a shot, it requires no preparation; but\r\nthe expediency of using it otherwise than as a shell is doubted. To make\r\nit available as a shell, the bursting tube, the concussion- and\r\ntime-fuzes, are all to be inserted; the bursting tube entering first and\r\nthe time-fuze being screwed in at the apex. If the time-fuze be\r\ncorrectly adjusted, the shell will burst when it reaches within a few\r\nyards of the object; or failing in this, it will burst by the\r\nconcussion-fuze when it strikes the object, or grazes the ground near\r\nit. If it be required to act as a canister-shot upon an enemy close to\r\nthe gun, the regulation of the time-fuze must be turned to the zero of\r\nthe scale, and then the shell will burst on leaving the gun. The\r\nArmstrong projectiles for the muzzle-loading guns have rows of brass or\r\ncopper studs projecting from their sides to tit into the grooves of the\r\ngun, which are constructed on the _shunt_ principle. The projectile is\r\nmade of wrought iron, or low steel, with very thick sides. There is no\r\nfuze, the explosion resulting from the heat generated by the impact, and\r\nthe crushing in of the thin cap which closes the mouth of the\r\npowder-chamber. The sides and bottom of the shell being thick enough to\r\nresist crushing by the impact, and also to resist the explosive force of\r\nthe bursting charge, its effect will, after penetration, be expended on\r\nthe backing of the armor, or the decks which the armor is intended to\r\nscreen. Such projectiles are called “blind shells.”\r\n\r\n_Blakely Projectile._--Capt. Blakely’s projectile has an expanding cap\r\nattached to its base by means of a single tap-bolt in the centre. It is\r\nprevented from turning by radial grooves cast on the surface of the\r\nbottom of the projectile, into which the cup is pressed by the charge.\r\nThe angle between the curved sides of the cup and the bottom of the\r\nprojectile is filled with a lubricating material. On the forward part of\r\nthe body are soft metal studs, more numerous than the grooves of the\r\nbore of the piece, that some of them may always form a bearing surface\r\nfor the projectile against the lands. The driving sides of the grooves\r\nare deeper than the others.\r\n\r\n_Dyer Projectile._--The Dyer projectile is composed of a cast-iron body,\r\nand a soft metal expanding cup, attached to its base. The adhesion of\r\nthe cup is effected by tinning the bottom of the projectile, and then\r\ncasting the cup on to it. The cup is composed of an alloy of lead, tin,\r\nand copper, in certain proportions. This projectile, as improved by Mr.\r\nTaylor at the Washington Arsenal, gives good results for even as large a\r\ncaliber as 12 inches.\r\n\r\n_French Projectile._--The projectile used in the French field service is\r\nmade of cast iron, and has 12 zinc studs on its sides, arranged in\r\npairs, so as to fit the 6 grooves of the gun. For the larger cannon\r\nprojectiles, but 3 studs are used, and these are cast on the projectile,\r\nnearly opposite to its centre of gravity; the bearing sides of the studs\r\nare faced with white metal to diminish friction against the grooves of\r\nthe bore. The shape of the grooves is such as to centre the projectile.\r\nThe latter projectile is used with increasing, the former with grooves\r\nof uniform twist. Russian, Austrian, and Spanish artillery projectiles\r\nbelong to the studded, or button class, but differ from each other in\r\nthe details of their construction.\r\n\r\n_Hotchkiss Projectile._--The Hotchkiss projectile is composed of three\r\nparts: the body, the expanding ring of lead, and the cast-iron cup. The\r\naction of the charge is to crowd the cup against the soft metal ring,\r\nthereby expanding it into the rifling of the gun. The time-fuze\r\nprojectile has deep longitudinal grooves cut on its sides to allow the\r\nflame to pass over and ignite the fuze. The last rifle projectile\r\nsubmitted by Mr. Hotchkiss has an expanding cup of brass attached to its\r\nbase in a peculiar manner. The cup is divided into four parts by thin\r\nprojections on the base of the projectile. This arrangement is intended\r\nto facilitate the expansion of the cup and to allow the flame to pass\r\nover to ignite the fuze.\r\n\r\n_James Projectile._--The expanding part of the James projectile consists\r\nof a hollow formed in the base of the projectile, and eight radial\r\nopenings, which extend from this hollow to the surface for the passage\r\nof the flame of the charge, which presses against and expands into the\r\ngrooves of the bore, an envelope or patch, composed of paper, canvas,\r\nand lead. In a later pattern of this projectile, the internal cavity and\r\nradial openings are omitted, and the outside is furrowed with\r\nlongitudinal grooves which increase in depth towards the base of the\r\nprojectile, forming inclined planes, up which the outer covering of lead\r\nand canvas is moved by the force of the charge and expanded into the\r\nrifling of the piece.\r\n\r\nThe first projectile used in Parrott guns was invented by Dr. Reed of\r\nAlabama, in 1856 or 1857, and was made at Parrott’s foundry. It\r\nconsisted of a soft wrought-iron cup, slightly swedged to fit the\r\ngrooves, upon which was cast the body of the shot.\r\n\r\n_Palliser Projectile._--This is the most formidable armor-piercing\r\nprojectile in use. It owes its efficiency to the material used,--chilled\r\ncast iron. In the later forms the head only is chilled, the body being\r\ncast in sand. Both shot and shell are cast with a core. The shell is\r\n“blind.” The curve of the ogival head is struck with a radius of one and\r\none-half times the diameter of the projectile.\r\n\r\n_Parrott Projectile._--Capt. Parrott’s projectile, as now made, is\r\ncomposed of a cast-iron body with a brass ring cast into a rabbet formed\r\naround its base. The flame presses against the bottom of the ring and\r\nunderneath it so as to expand it into the grooves of the gun. To prevent\r\nthe ring from turning in the rabbet, the latter is recessed at several\r\npoints of its circumference. _Parrott’s incendiary shell_ has two\r\ncompartments formed by a partition at right angles to its length. The\r\nlower and larger space is filled with a burning composition, the upper\r\none is filled with a bursting charge of powder, which is fired by a\r\ntime- or concussion-fuze. The burning composition is introduced through\r\na hole in the bottom of the shell, which is stopped up with a\r\nscrew-plug.\r\n\r\n_Sawyer Projectile._--The Sawyer projectile has upon its sides six\r\nrectangular flanges or ribs to fit into corresponding grooves of the\r\nbore. To soften the contact with the surface of the bore, the entire\r\nsurface of the projectile is covered with a coating of lead and\r\nbrass-foil. The soft metal at the corner of the base is made thicker\r\nthan at the sides to admit of being expanded into the grooves, and\r\nthereby closing the windage. In the latest pattern of Sawyer\r\nprojectiles, the flanges are omitted, and the projectiles are made to\r\ntake the grooves by the expansion of the soft metal at the base, which\r\nis peculiarly shaped for this purpose.\r\n\r\n_Schenkle Projectile._--Schenkle’s projectile is composed of a cast-iron\r\nbody, the posterior portion of which is a cone. The expanding portion is\r\na _papier-maché_ sabot or ring, which is expanded into the rifling of\r\nthe bore by being forced on to the cone by the action of the charge. On\r\nissuing from the bore the wad is blown to pieces, leaving the projectile\r\nunencumbered in its flight. A great difficulty has been found in\r\npractice in always getting a proper quality of material for the sabot,\r\nand in consequence, these projectiles have not been found to be\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\n_Scott Projectile._--The shell devised by Commander Scott of the British\r\nnavy, for firing molten iron, has three ribs cast upon it, which fit\r\ngrooves so constructed as to centre it in the bore of the gun when\r\nfired. The interior of this shell is lined with loam to prevent the heat\r\nof the charge from penetrating through to the bursting charge. It is\r\nsupposed to be broken and its contents diffused on striking the object.\r\n\r\n_Whitworth Projectile._--The cross-section of the bore of the Whitworth\r\ngun is a hexagon with the corners slightly rounded. The projectile is\r\nfirst formed so that its cross-section is a circle, and its sides taper\r\ntowards both ends. The middle portion is then carefully planed off to\r\nfit the bore of the gun. The Whitworth blind shell for firing against\r\narmor-plates, is made of tempered steel, and each end is closed with a\r\nscrew. To prevent the heat of impact from acting too soon on the\r\nbursting charge, it is surrounded by one or more thicknesses of flannel.\r\nA 7-inch shell of this kind has been found to have sufficient strength\r\nand stiffness to penetrate 5 inches of wrought iron before bursting.\r\n\r\n_Confederate Projectiles._--The rifle projectiles used by the\r\nConfederates in the late war belonged, with a few exceptions, to the\r\nexpanding class. Besides the above there are three kinds of projectiles\r\nmuch used in the U. S. service, viz.:\r\n\r\n_Absterdam Projectile._--The best form is cast in a single piece, and\r\nhas an expanding ring of brass which projects three-eighths of an inch\r\nbeyond the base of the projectile.\r\n\r\n_Eureka Projectile._--Consists of a cast-iron body in one piece, with a\r\nbrass sabot; the sabot is an annular disk intended to move on the\r\nfrustum of a cone with an expanding cup in rear to take the grooves.\r\n\r\n_Ordnance Projectile._--Consists of a cast-iron body, with a sabot\r\ncomposed of an alloy of lead and tin, which is cast on the base of the\r\nprojectile, and is held in position by undercuts and dovetails, the\r\naction of the charge being to force the sabot on the cast-iron body and\r\nto make it take the grooves.\r\n\r\nProjectiles of special construction were formerly much used for\r\nparticular purposes, as:\r\n\r\n_Bar-shot_, which consisted of two hemispheres or spheres connected by a\r\nbar of iron either rigidly or in such a manner as to traverse its\r\nlength; these were useful in cutting the masts and rigging of ships.\r\n\r\n_Chain-shot._--This differed from bar-shot only in the mode of\r\nconnection, which was a chain instead of a bar.\r\n\r\n_Chain-ball._--To arrest the motion of rotation of an oblong projectile\r\nthrown under high angles, and with a moderate velocity, it has been\r\nproposed to attach a light body to its posterior portion by means of a\r\ncord, or chain, which will offer a resistance to the flight of the\r\nprojectile, and cause it to move with its point foremost.\r\n\r\n_Nail-ball._--A round projectile, having a projecting pin to prevent it\r\nfrom turning in the bore of the piece.\r\n\r\n_Grooved Ball._--An oblong projectile, having spiral grooves cut along\r\nits base, by means of which the action of the charge produces rotation\r\nabout the longer axis of the projectile. Sometimes these grooves are cut\r\nin the forward part of the projectile for the action of the air. Neither\r\nof these plans has succeeded in practice.\r\n\r\n_Bullets._--A bullet is a leaden projectile discharged from a musket,\r\nfowling-piece, pistol, or similar weapon.\r\n\r\n_Spherical Bullets._--When smooth-bore muskets alone were used the\r\nbullets were chiefly spherical in form and made by casting; at present,\r\nhowever, spherical bullets are manufactured by a compressing machine\r\ninvented by Mr. George Napier. They are denominated by the number\r\ncontained in a pound. In consequence of the great improvements that have\r\nbeen made of late in small-arms, the spherical bullet is now very little\r\nemployed for military purposes, its use being chiefly confined to\r\ncase-shot.\r\n\r\n_Oblong Bullets._--Are denominated by their diameter and weight. About\r\n1600, when rifles began to be used as a military weapon, spherical\r\nbullets were fired; in the early part of the 18th century, however, it\r\nwas found that good results could be obtained by the use of oblong\r\nprojectiles of elliptical form. The great difficulty, however, of\r\nloading the rifle, which was ordinarily accomplished by the blows of a\r\nmallet on a stout iron ramrod, prevented it from being generally used in\r\nregular warfare. The foregoing plan was afterwards improved by making\r\nthe projectile a little smaller than the bore, and wrapping it with a\r\npatch of cloth greased to diminish the friction in loading. The\r\nimprovements which have been made in the last thirty years have entirely\r\novercome this difficulty, and rifles are now almost universally\r\nemployed, although until 1855 the mass of the American infantry was\r\narmed with smooth-bored muskets. The first person to overcome the\r\ndifficulty of loading rifles was M. Delavigne, an officer of the French\r\ninfantry. His plan, proposed in 1827, was to make the projectile small\r\nenough to enter the bore easily and to attach it to a sabot, which, when\r\nin position, rested upon the shoulder of a cylindrical chamber formed at\r\nthe bottom of the bore to contain the powder. In this position the\r\nprojectile was struck two or three times with the ramrod, which expanded\r\nthe lead into the grooves of the barrel. The method of Delavigne was\r\nafterwards improved by Thouvenin and Minié, both officers of the French\r\nservice. The projectiles suggested by them were elongated in form and\r\nthe metal of the projectile was forced into the grooves of the rifling\r\nby means of a plug or cup driven into the base of the projectile, which\r\nwas cast hollow for that purpose. The cup used in the Minié bullet wits\r\nmade of sheet-iron. Mr. Greener of England appears to have been the\r\nfirst person to utilize this expanding or dilating action. Various other\r\nbullets have been invented, of greater or less usefulness, as the\r\nWhitworth, Pritchett or Enfield, and those used in the French, Austrian,\r\nand Swiss services. In the British service, the Enfield bullet is\r\nemployed; this has a perfectly smooth exterior, and a conical boxwood\r\nplug inserted into a cavity at the base; they are made by machinery\r\nwhich draws in a coil of leaden rod, unwinds it, cuts it to the required\r\nlength, stamps out the bullets with steel dies, drops them into boxes,\r\nand conveys them away.\r\n\r\n_United States Bullets._--The bullets used in the U. S. service are of\r\ntwo kinds, one for the rifle and carbine ball-cartridge weighing 405\r\ngrains, the other for the revolver cartridge weighing 230 grains. The\r\nmetal used is an alloy of 16 parts of lead and 1 part of tin. The bullet\r\nin shape is a cylinder surmounted by a conical frustum terminating in a\r\nspherical segment. It has three rectangular cannelures which contain the\r\nlubricant. This latter is protected by the case which covers more than\r\nhalf the length of the bullet. A dished cavity is made in the base of\r\nthe bullet to bring it to the proper weight.\r\n\r\n=Projectiles, Theory of.= Is the investigation of the path, or\r\n_trajectory_ as it is called, of a body which is projected into space. A\r\nbody thus projected is acted upon by two forces, the _force of\r\nprojection_, which, if acting alone, would carry the body onwards\r\nforever in the same direction and at the same rate; and the _force of\r\ngravity_, which tends to draw the body downwards towards the earth. The\r\nforce of projection acts only at the commencement of the body’s motion;\r\nthe force of gravity, on the contrary, continues to act effectively\r\nduring the whole time of the body’s motion, drawing it farther and\r\nfarther from its original direction, and causing it to describe a curved\r\npath, which, if the body moved in a vacuum, would be accurately a\r\nparabola.\r\n\r\n_Trajectory in Vacuo._--This general theory is not the object of the\r\npresent discussion, but simply the theory of projectiles as far as it\r\nrelates to fire-arms. The path that the centre of gravity of a\r\nprojectile would describe in _vacuo_ would be a parabola, and the\r\ngreatest range given by an angle of fire of 45°. Under the same angles\r\nof fire the range would be proportional to the squares of the\r\nvelocities, the velocity least at the summit of the trajectory, and the\r\nvelocities at the two points in which the trajectory cuts the horizontal\r\nplane equal. The time of flight would be given for an angle of 45° by\r\nthe formula:\r\n\r\n  _T_ = ¹⁄₄√_X_\r\n\r\nIn which _T_ represents the time of flight, and _X_ the range expressed\r\nin feet. These results are found to answer in practice for projectiles\r\nwhich experience slight resistance from the air, or for heavy\r\nprojectiles moving with low velocities, as is usually the case with\r\nthose of mortars and howitzers, for which, within certain limits, the\r\nabove results are sufficiently accurate in practice.\r\n\r\n_Trajectory in Air._--A body moving in air experiences a resistance\r\nwhich diminishes the velocity with which it is animated. Thus it has\r\nbeen shown that certain cannon-balls do not range one-eighth as far in\r\nthe air, as they would if they did not meet with this resistance to\r\ntheir motion, and small-arm projectiles which have but little mass are\r\nstill more affected by it. This resistance is expressed by the formula:\r\n\r\n                 (    _v_)\r\n  _P_ = _A_{p}R_²(1 + ---)_v_²;\r\n                 (    _r_)\r\n\r\nin which _P_ represents the resistance in the terms of the unit of\r\nweight, _v_ the velocity, and _pR_² the area of a cross-section of the\r\nprojectile, _A_ the resistance in pounds on a square foot of the\r\ncross-section of a projectile moving with a velocity of one foot, _r_ is\r\na linear quantity depending on the velocity of the projectile. For all\r\nservice spherical projectiles _A_ is .000514, and for all service\r\nvelocities _r_ is 1.427 feet; the value of _A_ for the rifle-musket\r\nbullet is .000358; hence, the resistance of the air is about one-third\r\nless on the ogival than on the spherical form of projectile. _A_ being a\r\nfunction of the density of air, its value depends on the temperature,\r\npressure, and hygrometric condition. It has been demonstrated that the\r\nfinal velocity of a projectile falling in the air is directly\r\nproportional to the product of its diameter and density, and inversely\r\nproportional to the density of the air; the retarding effect of the air\r\nis less on the larger and denser projectiles, and for the same caliber\r\nan oblong projectile will be less retarded by the air than one of\r\nspherical form and consequently with an equal, perhaps less, initial\r\nvelocity, its range will be greater. It has also been shown that great\r\nadvantage in point of range is obtained by using large projectiles\r\ninstead of small ones, solid projectiles instead of hollow ones, leaden\r\nprojectiles instead of iron ones, and oblong projectiles instead of\r\nround ones. The ogival form, or the form of the present rifle-musket\r\nbullet, experiences less resistance in passing through the air than any\r\nother known. In consequence of the variable nature of the resistance of\r\nthe air, it has been found impossible to find an accurate expression for\r\nthe trajectory. Capt. Didion, of Metz, has, however, found an\r\napproximate solution; he states that all cases of the movement of a\r\nprojectile may be divided into three classes: 1st. When the angle of\r\nprojection is slight or does not exceed 3°, as in the ordinary fire of\r\nguns, howitzers, and small-arms,--for slight variations of the angle of\r\nprojection above or below the horizontal, the form of the trajectory may\r\nbe considered constant, and when the object is but slightly raised above\r\nor depressed below the horizontal plane, it may be considered as in\r\nthis plane. 2d. When angles of projection do not exceed 10° or 15°, as\r\nin the ricochet fire of guns, howitzers, and mortars. 3d. When the angle\r\nof projection exceeds 15°, as is the case in mortar fire. For each of\r\nthese cases he has deduced formulæ, by means of which the range, time of\r\nflight, etc., can be determined. As a projectile rises in the ascending\r\nbranch of its trajectory, its velocity is diminished by the retarding\r\neffect of the air, and the force of gravity, in consequence of the\r\nresistance of the air alone, the velocity continues to diminish to a\r\npoint a little beyond the summit of the trajectory, where it is a\r\nminimum, and from this point it increases, as it descends, under the\r\ninfluence of the force of gravity, until it becomes uniform, which event\r\ndepends on the diameter and weight of the projectile, and the density of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nThe inclination of the trajectory decreases from the origin to the\r\nsummit, where it is nothing, it increases in the descending branch from\r\nthe summit to its termination, and if the ground did not interpose an\r\nobstacle, it would become vertical at an infinite distance. An element\r\nof the trajectory in the descending branch has a greater inclination\r\nthan the corresponding element of the ascending branch. Strictly\r\nspeaking, therefore, the trajectory of a projectile in air is not a\r\nparabola, but is an exponential curve with two asymptotes, the first the\r\naxis of the piece, which is tangent to the trajectory when the initial\r\nvelocity is infinite, the second a vertical line toward which the\r\ntrajectory approaches, as the horizontal component of the velocity\r\ndiminishes and the effect of the force of gravity increases. The\r\ncurvature of the trajectory increases in the ascending branch to a point\r\na little beyond the summit. The point of greatest curvature is situated\r\nnearer the summit than the point of minimum velocity. In the fire of\r\nmortar-shells, under great angles of projection, the trajectory may be\r\nconsidered as an arc, in which the angle of fall is slightly greater\r\nthan the angle of projection. In the formulæ deduced by Didion, in\r\nconsequence of considering the inclination of the trajectory as\r\nconstant, the resistance of the air is slightly underestimated in the\r\nmore inclined portions of the trajectory or at the beginning and end,\r\nand slightly overestimated in the less inclined portions or about the\r\nsummit. It follows that the calculated trajectory will at first rise\r\nabove the true one, then pass below it and again pass above it; the\r\ncalculated ranges are therefore slightly in excess of the true ones.\r\n\r\n_Trajectory of Oblong Projectiles._--From the law of inertia, a rifle\r\nprojectile moves through the air with its axis of rotation parallel to\r\nthe axis of the bore. Hence it follows that an oblong projectile, fired\r\nunder a low angle of projection, presents a greater surface toward the\r\nearth, and less parallel to it, than a round projectile of the same\r\nweight, consequently the vertical component of the resistance of the air\r\nis greater, and the horizontal component less, in the first case than in\r\nthe second. The effect of this will be to give an oblong projectile a\r\nflatter trajectory and longer range than a round one.\r\n\r\n_Deviation of Projectiles._--The path described by the centre of inertia\r\nof a projectile, moving under the influences of gravity and the\r\ntangential resistance of the air, is called the _normal trajectory_. In\r\npractice, various causes are constantly at work to deflect a projectile\r\nfrom its normal path. All deviating causes may be divided into two\r\nclasses,--those which act while the projectile is in the bore of the\r\npiece, and those which act after the projectile has left it. The first\r\nclass includes all the causes which affect the initial velocity, and\r\ngive rotation to the projectile; the second includes the action of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n_Causes which affect Initial Velocity._--The principal causes which\r\naffect initial velocity are variations in the weights of the powder and\r\nprojectile, the manner of loading, the temperature of the piece, and the\r\nballoting of the projectile along the bore. _Rotation._ The principal\r\ncause of the deviation of a projectile is its rotation combined with the\r\nresistance of the air. _By balloting._ If the projectile be spherical\r\nand homogeneous, rotation is produced by the bounding or balloting of\r\nthe ball in the bore, arising from the windage. In this case the axis of\r\nrotation is horizontal, and passes through the centre of the ball; the\r\ndirection of rotation depends on the side of the projectile which\r\nstrikes the surface of the bore last. The velocity of rotation from this\r\ncause depends on the windage, or depth of the indentations in the bore,\r\nthe charge being the same. _By eccentricity._ If, from the structure of\r\nthe ball, or from some defect of manufacture, the centre of gravity does\r\nnot coincide with the centre of figure, rotation generally takes place\r\naround the centre of gravity. This arises from the fact that the\r\nresultant of the charge acts at the centre of figure, while inertia, or\r\nresistance to motion, acts at the centre of gravity. For the same charge\r\nthe velocity of rotation passes through the centre of gravity, and is\r\nperpendicular to a plane containing the resultant of the charge and the\r\ncentres of figure and gravity. For the same charge, the velocity of\r\nrotation is proportional to the lever arm, or the perpendicular, let\r\nfall from the centre of gravity to the resultant of the charge. Knowing\r\nthe position of the centre of gravity of the ball in the bore, it is\r\neasy to foretell the direction and velocity of rotation. In general\r\nterms the front surface of the projectile moves toward the side of the\r\nbore on which the centre of gravity is situated, and the velocity of\r\nrotation is greatest when the line joining the centres of gravity and\r\nfigure is perpendicular to the axis of the bore.\r\n\r\n_The Effect of Rotation._--The effect of rotation in producing deviation\r\nmay be discussed under three heads: 1st. When the projectile is\r\nspherical and concentric; 2d. When it is spherical and eccentric; and,\r\n3d. When it is oblong. If a projectile be spherical and concentric,\r\nrotation takes place from contact with the surface of the bore around a\r\nhorizontal axis, and the effect will be to shorten or lengthen the\r\nrange, as the motion of the front surface is downward or upward. If the\r\nprojectile be eccentric, the motion of the front surface is generally\r\ntoward the side on which the centre of gravity is situated, and the\r\ndeviation takes place in this direction. The extent of the deviation for\r\nthe same charge depends on the position of the centre of gravity; the\r\nhorizontal deviation being the greatest when the centres of gravity and\r\nfigure are in a horizontal plane, and the line which joins them is at\r\nright angles to the axis of the piece; the vertical deviation will be\r\nthe greatest when these centres are in a vertical plane, and the line\r\nwhich joins them is at right angles to the axis of the piece. If the\r\naxis of rotation coincide with the tangent to the trajectory throughout\r\nthe flight, all points of the surface have the same velocity in the\r\ndirection of the motion of translation, and there will be no deviation.\r\nThis explains why it is that a rifle projectile moves through the air\r\nmore accurately than a projectile from a smooth-bored gun. In accurate\r\nfiring, therefore, it is important to know the true position of the\r\ncentre of gravity. In ricochet firing over smooth water, the number of\r\ngrazes may be increased or diminished by placing, in loading, the centre\r\nof gravity above or below the centre of figure.\r\n\r\n_Deviation of Oblong Projectiles._--The cause of the deviation of an\r\noblong rifle projectile is quite different from one of spherical form.\r\nAn oblong projectile moving in the air is acted upon by two rotary\r\nforces, viz.: one which gives it its normal rotary motion around its\r\naxis of progression, and another the resistance of the air, which, in\r\nconsequence of the deflection of the axis of progression from the\r\ntangent to the trajectory by the action of gravity, does not pass\r\nthrough the centre of inertia, but above or below it; depending on the\r\nshape of the projectile. From a law of mechanics, a body thus\r\ncircumstanced will not yield fully to either of the forces that thus act\r\nupon it, but its apex will move off with a slow uniform motion to the\r\nright or left of the vertical plane, depending on the relative direction\r\nof the two rotary forces. If the action of these forces be continued\r\nsufficiently long, it will be seen that the axis of the projectile\r\nbefore referred to describes a cone around a line passing through the\r\ncentre of inertia and parallel to the direction of the resistance of the\r\nair. Owing to the short duration of the flight of an ordinary\r\nprojectile, it is only necessary to consider the first part of this\r\nconical motion. If the projectile rotates in the direction of the hands\r\nof a watch to the eye of the marksman, and the resultant of the\r\nresistance of the air pass above the centre of inertia, as it does in\r\nthe service bullet with a conoidal point, then the point of the\r\nprojectile will move to the right, which brings the left side of the\r\nprojectile obliquely in contact with the current of the air. The effect\r\nof this position with reference to the air will be to generate a\r\ncomponent force that will urge the projectile to the right of the plane\r\nof fire. This peculiar deviation was called by the French officers that\r\nfirst observed it, “_derivation_,” or “_drift_.”\r\n\r\n_Summary of Deviating Causes._--The following summary may be considered\r\nas embracing nearly all the causes of deviation of cannon and small-arm\r\nprojectiles: 1st. _From the construction of the piece._ These causes\r\nare, wrong position of the sight; bore not of the true size; windage,\r\netc. 2d. _From the charge of powder._ Improper weight; form of grain and\r\nvariable quality of the powder, etc. 3d. _From the projectile._ Not of\r\nthe exact size, shape, or weight; disfiguration in loading, or on\r\nleaving the bore; eccentricity. 4th. _From the atmosphere_, _etc._ The\r\neffect of wind; variations in the temperature, moisture, and density of\r\nthe air; position of the sun as regards the effect on the aim;\r\ndifference of level between the object and the piece; and rotation of\r\nthe earth. It is found that a projectile will deviate to the right of\r\nthe object in the northern hemisphere whatever may be the direction of\r\nthe line of fire, and at a distance from it, depending on the latitude\r\nof the place, and on the time of flight and the range of the projectile.\r\n\r\n=Projectiles, Effects of.= The effects of projectiles, and particularly\r\nthat of penetration, depend on the nature of the projectile, its initial\r\nvelocity, and the distance of the object. The effects of the various\r\nkinds of projectiles upon iron and steel plates are not yet thoroughly\r\nunderstood, and experiments are still being made, particularly in\r\nEngland, to determine the best combinations of wrought and cast iron,\r\nand steel, to resist the penetration of the enormous projectiles of the\r\npresent day. Their effects upon wood, earth, etc., are, however, better\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n_Effect on Wood._--The effect of a projectile fired against wood varies\r\nwith the nature of the wood and the direction of the penetration. If the\r\nprojectile strikes perpendicular to the fibres, and the fibres be tough\r\nand elastic, as in the case of oak, a portion of them are crushed, and\r\nothers are bent under the pressure of the projectile, but regain their\r\nform as soon as it has passed by them. In consequence of the softness of\r\nwhite pine, nearly all the fibres struck are broken, and the orifice is\r\nnearly the size of the projectile; for the same reason the effects of\r\nthe projectile do not extend much beyond the orifice; pine is therefore\r\nto be preferred to oak for structures that are not intended to resist\r\ncannon projectiles, as block-houses, etc.\r\n\r\n_Effect on Earth._--Earth possesses advantages over all other materials\r\nas a covering against projectiles; it is cheap and easily obtained, it\r\noffers considerable resistance to penetration, and to a certain extent\r\nregains its position after displacement. It is found by experience that\r\na projectile has very little effect on an earthen parapet unless it\r\npasses completely through it. Wherever masonry is liable to be breached,\r\nit should be masked by earthworks with natural slopes. Gen. Gillmore\r\nstates that the powers of resistance of pure, compact, quartz sand to\r\nthe penetration of projectiles very much exceed that of ordinary earth,\r\nor mixture of several earths. The size of the openings formed by the\r\npassage of a projectile into the earth is about one-third larger than\r\nthe projectile, increasing, however, towards the outer orifice. Rifle\r\nprojectiles especially are easily deflected from their course in earth,\r\nhence their penetration is variable. Unless a shell be very large in\r\nproportion to the mass of earth penetrated, its explosion will produce\r\nbut little displacement,--generally, a small opening is formed around an\r\nexploded shell by the action of the gas in pressing back the earth.\r\nTime-fuzes, being liable to be extinguished by the pressure of the\r\nearth, are inferior to percussion-fuzes, which produce explosion when\r\nthe projectile has made about three-fourths of its proper penetration.\r\nThe penetration in earth of oblong, compared to round projectiles, when\r\nfired with service charges, and at a distance of about 400 yards, is at\r\nleast _one-fourth greater_. This difference, however, is less at short\r\nand greater at long distances. The penetrations of similar projectiles\r\ninto a given substance, are proportional to the squares of the\r\nvelocities of impact and to the diameters and densities of the\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\n_Penetration in Water._--The penetration of a rifle projectile in water\r\ndepends much on the direction of its axis with respect to penetration;\r\nfor instance, penetration rapidly diminishes at long distances, as the\r\naxis of the projectile strikes the surface of the water under a\r\ndiminished angle.\r\n\r\n_Effect on Masonry._--The effect of a projectile against masonry is to\r\nform a truncated conical hole, terminated by another of a cylindrical\r\nform. The material in front of and around the projectile is broken and\r\nshattered, and the end of the cylindrical hole even reduced to powder.\r\nThe exterior opening varies from four to five times the diameter of the\r\nprojectile, and the depth varies with the size and density of the\r\nprojectile, and its velocity. When a projectile strikes against a\r\nsurface of oak, as the side of a ship, it will not stick if the angle of\r\nincidence be less than 15°, and if it do not penetrate to a depth nearly\r\nequal to its diameter. Solid cast-iron shot break against granite, but\r\nnot against freestone or brick. Shells are broken into small fragments\r\nagainst each of these materials.\r\n\r\n_Breaching._--Formerly stone projectiles were much used for breaching,\r\nbut from the want of sufficient hardness in these projectiles, the\r\nbesiegers were forced to commence battering at the top of the wall where\r\nthe least resistance was offered, and gradually to lower the shot until\r\nthe breach reached the wrecks already formed at the base of the wall.\r\nIron projectiles superseded stone, and then more rapid modes of\r\neffecting a practicable breach were suggested. The easiest manner of\r\nmaking the cut is to direct the shots upon the same line, and form a\r\nseries of holes a little greater than a diameter apart, and then to fire\r\na second series of shots, directed at the intervals between the first,\r\nand so on, until an opening is made completely through the wall. If the\r\nportion of the wall between the vertical cuts should not be overthrown\r\nby the pressure of the earth behind, it must be detached by a few\r\nvolleys of solid shot, fired at its centre.\r\n\r\n_Breaching with Rifle-cannon._--The foregoing has reference particularly\r\nto breaching masonry with smooth-bored guns. The same principle is\r\napplicable to rifled guns, the only difference being that, from their\r\nsuperior penetration and accuracy, the latter are effective at much\r\nlonger distances. The most destructive projectile against masonry is the\r\nelongated percussion shell.\r\n\r\n_Effect of Bullets._--From experiments made in Denmark, the following\r\nrelations were found between the penetration of a bullet in pine and its\r\neffects on the body of a living horse, viz.: 1st. When the force of the\r\nbullet is sufficient to penetrate 0.31 inch into pine, it is only\r\nsufficient to produce a slight contusion of the skin. 2d. When the force\r\nof penetration is equal to 0.63 inch, the wound begins to be dangerous,\r\nbut does not disable. 3d. When the force of penetration is equal to 1.2\r\ninch, the wound is very dangerous. A plate of wrought iron\r\nthree-sixteenths of an inch thick, is sufficient to resist a\r\nrifle-musket bullet at distances varying from 20 to 200 yards. Iron of\r\nthickness, however, will not resist bullets of the present day. That a\r\nrope mantlet may give full protection against rifle-musket bullets, it\r\nshould be composed of five layers (three vertical and two horizontal) of\r\n4¹⁄₂-inch rope.\r\n\r\n=Projection.= In mathematics, the action of giving a projectile its\r\nmotion. It is also used to signify a scheme, plan, or delineation.\r\n\r\n=Proking-spit.= A large Spanish rapier.\r\n\r\n=Prolongation.= An extension of leave of absence, or a continuation of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Prolongation of the Line.= Is effected by parallel movements at the\r\nright or left of any given number of men on a front division.\r\n\r\n=Prolonge.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Prolonge-hooks.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, NOMENCLATURE OF ARTILLERY\r\nCARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Promotion.= This word signifies, in military matters, the elevation of\r\nan individual to some appointment of greater rank and trust to the one\r\nhe holds.\r\n\r\n=Promulgation.= The act of promulgating; publication; open declaration;\r\nas, the promulgation of the sentence of a court-martial.\r\n\r\n=Proof.= A term applied to the testing of powder, and also of ordnance,\r\nwhich are always fired with a regulated charge of powder and shot, to\r\ntest their strength and soundness.\r\n\r\n=Proof.= Conclusive evidence.\r\n\r\n=Proof.= Capable of withstanding; as, bomb-proof, shot-proof.\r\n\r\n=Propel.= To drive forward; to urge or press onward by force; to move or\r\ncause to move; balls are _propelled_ by the force of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n=Proper.= A term which serves to mark out a thing more especially and\r\nformally. Thus, the _proper form of a battalion_ is the usual continuity\r\nof line given to the formation of a battalion, and which remains\r\nunaltered by the wheelings of its divisions; or if altered, is restored\r\nby the same operation. _Proper right_, is the right of a battalion,\r\ncompany, or subdivision, when it is drawn up according to its natural\r\nformation. _Proper pivot flank_, in column, is that which, when wheeled\r\nup to, preserves the division of the line in the natural order, and to\r\ntheir proper front. The other may be called the _reverse_ flank.\r\n\r\n=Proper.= In heraldry, a charge borne of its natural color, is said to\r\nbe _proper_. An object whose color varies at different times and in\r\ndifferent examples, as a rose which may be white or red cannot be borne\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n=Prosecute.= To carry on; to continue; as, to prosecute the war. Also,\r\nto accuse of some crime or breach of law, or to pursue for punishment\r\nbefore a legal tribunal; to proceed against judicially.\r\n\r\n=Prosecutor.= In courts-martial the judge-advocate is usually the\r\nprosecutor; but if an officer prefers a charge, he sometimes appears to\r\nsustain the prosecution. No person can appear as prosecutor not subject\r\nto the articles of war, except the judge-advocate.--_Hough._\r\n\r\n=Proveditor.= One employed to procure supplies for an army; a purveyor.\r\n\r\n=Proving-ground.= Ground used for testing powder or ordnance.\r\n\r\n=Provision.= Properly to victual; to furnish with provisions.\r\n\r\n=Provost.= The temporary prison in which the military police confine\r\nprisoners till they are disposed of.\r\n\r\n=Provost Cells.= Also called regimental or garrison cells, in the\r\nBritish service are those certified cells under a provost or acting\r\nprovost-sergeant, in which court-martial prisoners may be imprisoned up\r\nto forty-two days.\r\n\r\n=Provost-Marshal.= In the army, is an officer appointed to superintend\r\nthe preservation of order, and to be, as it were, the head of the police\r\nof any particular camp, town, or district. He has cognizance of all\r\ncamp-followers, as well as members of the army. His power is summary,\r\nand he can punish an offender, taken _flagrante delicto_, on the spot,\r\naccording to the articles of war.\r\n\r\n=Provost-Sergeant.= Is a sergeant who is charged with the military\r\npolice of a corps. He is generally given one or two non-commissioned\r\nofficers as assistants. In the British service he also is charged with\r\nthe custody of all prisoners in the cells.\r\n\r\n=Prowess.= Valor; bravery in the field; military gallantry.\r\n\r\n=Prowlers.= Are persons who steal within the lines of a hostile army for\r\nthe purpose of robbing, killing; or destroying bridges, roads, mails, or\r\nother means of communication. Such persons are not entitled to the\r\nprivileges usually accorded to prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n=Prussia.= A kingdom of the new German empire. The people of Prussia\r\nfirst appear in history in the 10th century, under the name of Borussi;\r\nfrom these the country derives its name. Some historians, however,\r\nderive the name from _Po_, signifying near, and _Russia_. The Prussians\r\nwere subjected by Boleslaus of Poland in 1018; they made a successful\r\nstand against Boleslaus IV. of Poland in 1161, and for a time maintained\r\na rude and savage kind of independence. The Teutonic Knights were\r\nengaged in war for half a century with the people,--winning lands and\r\nsouls by hard fighting,--until at length, in 1283, they found themselves\r\nundisputed masters of the country, having almost exterminated the pagan\r\npopulation. During this period the knights founded many cities and\r\nrepeopled the country with German colonists. In 1454 the municipal and\r\nnoble classes, with the co-operation of Poland, rose in open rebellion\r\nagainst the knights, who were forced to cede West Prussia and Ermland to\r\nPoland. Albert (or Albrecht) of Brandenburg was acknowledged duke of\r\nEast Prussia in 1525; his son-in-law, John Sigismund, created elector of\r\nBrandenburg and duke of Prussia in 1608. The reign of John Sigismund’s\r\nsuccessor, Georg-Wilhelm (1619-1640), was distracted by the miseries of\r\nthe Thirty Years’ War, and the country was alternately the prey of\r\nSwedish and imperial armies. The electorate was raised by the genius of\r\nFrederick William, the great elector, to the rank of a great European\r\npower. His successor, Frederick III. (1688-1713), was proclaimed king of\r\nPrussia by the title of Frederick I. in 1701. During the reign of\r\nFrederick William IV., Prussia co-operated powerfully in putting down\r\nthe insurrections in Poland and Baden. In the war of the\r\nSchleswig-Holstein duchies, the Prussians acted in concert with the\r\ndisaffected against their sovereign, the king of Denmark, occupying the\r\nducal provinces in the name and on behalf of the diet. A treaty of peace\r\nwas concluded between Prussia and Denmark, on July 2, 1850. In 1863 the\r\nallied Prussian and Austrian armies entered the duchies of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein and defeated the Danes; the duchies were separated\r\nfrom Denmark. Warm disputes with Austria respecting Schleswig-Holstein\r\narose in the beginning of 1866. The vote of the majority of the diet of\r\nthe Germanic Confederation supported Austria; Prussia announced her\r\nwithdrawal from the confederation, and its dissolution; the diet\r\ndeclared itself indissoluble, and continued its functions, June 14,\r\n1866. War was declared by Prussia, June 18, 1866, which ended in the\r\ntotal defeat of Austria and her allies. A treaty of peace between\r\nAustria and Prussia was signed at Prague on August 23, 1866. By its\r\narticles Austria consented to the breaking up of the Germanic\r\nConfederation, and to Prussia’s annexing Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, Nassau,\r\nand Frankfort-on-the-Main, and gave up Holstein and her political\r\ninfluence in North Germany. For further history, see FRANCO-PRUSSIAN\r\nWAR.\r\n\r\n=Pruth.= A river of Europe, which rises in the Carpathian Mountains. It\r\nforms a portion of the boundary-line between Russia and Turkey, and by\r\ncrossing it, in 1853, the Russians gave rise to the war with Turkey and\r\nthe subsequent Crimean war.\r\n\r\n=Psiloi.= Among the Greeks, were light-armed men who fought with arrows\r\nand darts, or stones and slings, but were unfit for close fight. They\r\nwere in honor and dignity inferior to the heavy-armed soldiers.\r\n\r\n=Publish.= To make known. In a garrison orders are published by being\r\nread at parade. Orders are also published by circulating written copies.\r\n\r\n=Puebla=, or =La Puebla de los Angeles=. Capital of the department of\r\nPuebla, in Mexico, 80 miles southeast from the city of Mexico. It was\r\ntaken by the French on May 17, 1863, after a siege of several weeks’\r\nduration, the Mexican general Ortega, with 18,000 men, surrendering to\r\nGen. Forey. This event threw open the road to Mexico, and was the\r\nimmediate precursor of the overthrow of the government of Juarez.\r\n\r\n=Pueblo Indians= (Sp. _pueblo_, “village”). An interesting class of\r\nsemi-civilized Indians in New Mexico and Arizona, so called from their\r\nremarkable residences, a description of some of which may be found under\r\nMOQUIS INDIANS. They are divided into several tribes speaking different\r\nlanguages. Their internal administration is patriarchal, each pueblo or\r\nvillage being ruled by its governor and council of three elders.\r\n\r\n=Pulk.= A tribe; a particular body of men. This word is chiefly used in\r\nRussia; as, a pulk of Cossacks.\r\n\r\n=Pultowa.= See POLTAVA.\r\n\r\n=Pultusk.= A town of Poland in the government of Plock, situated on the\r\nNarew, 35 miles north-northeast from Warsaw. Here on December 26, 1806,\r\nwas fought one of the battles of the campaign of Eylau, between the\r\nRussians and the French. The field was most obstinately contested, but\r\nthe victory, which, however, was claimed by both armies, inclined in\r\nfavor of the French.\r\n\r\n=Pummel.= The hilt of a sword, the end of a gun, etc.\r\n\r\n=Puncto.= The point in fencing.\r\n\r\n=Punic Wars.= The name of three celebrated contests, in which the Romans\r\nand Carthaginians were engaged from the year 264 to 146 B.C., and which\r\nfinally terminated with the destruction of Carthage. It was in the\r\nsecond war, which began in 218, that the Carthaginian commander Hannibal\r\nrendered himself so distinguished by his victories over the Romans. The\r\nillustrious Scipio was eventually the conqueror of Hannibal and the\r\nvictor of Carthage. _Punic faith_ is a reproachful term in frequent use,\r\nderived from _Punici_, or Carthaginians, because they were considered by\r\nthe Romans a perfidious race.\r\n\r\n=Punishment, Military.= In a military sense, is the execution of a\r\nsentence pronounced by a court-martial upon any delinquent. The Romans\r\npunished crimes committed by the soldiery with the utmost rigor. On the\r\noccurrence of a mutiny, every tenth, twentieth, or hundredth man was\r\nsometimes chosen by lot, but generally only the ringleaders were\r\nselected for punishment. Deserters and seditious persons were\r\nfrequently, after being scourged, sold for slaves; and occasionally the\r\noffender was made to lose his right hand, or was bled nearly to death.\r\nAmong the nations of Western Europe, the punishments for military\r\noffenses were, till lately, no less severe than they were among the\r\nRomans. Besides the infliction of a certain number of lashes with cords,\r\nsoldiers convicted of theft, marauding, or any other breach of\r\ndiscipline which was not punishable with death, were sentenced to run\r\nthe gantlope. (See GANTLOPE.) In Russia the knout was extensively used.\r\n(See KNOUT.) It is often necessary to punish to maintain discipline, and\r\nthe rules and articles of war provide ample means of punishment, but not\r\nsufficient rewards and guards against errors of judgment. In the French\r\narmy degrading punishments are illegal, but soldiers may be confined to\r\nquarters or deprived of the liberty of leaving the garrison; confined in\r\nthe guard-room, in prison, or in dungeon; required to walk or to perform\r\nhard labor; and officers may be subjected to simple or rigorous arrests.\r\nEvery officer who inflicts a punishment, must account for it to his\r\nsuperior, who approves or disapproves, confirms, augments, or diminishes\r\nit. If an inferior is confined to the guard-room, he cannot be liberated\r\nexcept upon application to a superior. Any officer who has been\r\nsubjected to punishment, must, when relieved, make a visit to him who\r\nordered it. The French code has, in a word, been careful to provide for\r\nboth the security of its citizens and the strength of authority. The\r\npunishments established by law or custom for U. S. soldiers by sentence\r\nof court-martial, are embodied in the Articles of War. (See APPENDIX,\r\nARTICLES OF WAR.) It is regarded as inhuman to punish by solitary\r\nconfinement, or confinement on bread and water exceeding fourteen days\r\nat a time, or for more than eighty-four days in a year, at intervals of\r\nfourteen days.\r\n\r\n=Punitz.= A town of Prussia in the province of Posen. A battle was\r\nfought here in 1706, between the Saxons and the Swedes, in which the\r\nlatter were victorious.\r\n\r\n=Punjab=, or =Five Rivers=. An extensive river of Hindostan, situated\r\nchiefly in the province of Lahore, but including Moultan, and comprising\r\nthe country traversed by the “five great waters,” or rivers, of which\r\nthe Indus is the most westerly, and the Sutlej the most easterly. This\r\nregion was traversed by Alexander the Great in 327 B.C.; and again by\r\nTamerlane in 1398. The wars with the Sikhs began here on March 29, 1849,\r\nwhen the Punjab was annexed to the British possessions in India.\r\n\r\n=Punkah.= A swinging fan used in the hot districts of India.\r\n\r\n=Purchasing.= Any person purchasing from any soldier his arms, uniform,\r\nclothing, or any part thereof, may be punished by any civil court having\r\ncognizance of the same, by fine in any sum not exceeding $300, or by\r\nimprisonment not exceeding one year.--_Act of March 16, 1802._\r\n\r\n=Purpure.= In heraldry, the color purple, expressed in engravings by\r\nlines in bend sinister. It is of unfrequent occurrence in British\r\nheraldry.\r\n\r\n=Pursuit.= The act of following or going after; a following with haste,\r\neither for sport or hostility; as, the pursuit of an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Pursuivant.= The third and lowest order of heraldic officers. The\r\noffice was instituted as a novitiate, or state of probation, through\r\nwhich the offices of herald and king-at-arms were ordinarily to be\r\nattained, though it has been held that a herald or king-at-arms may be\r\nmade _per saltum_. For the present titles of the several British\r\npursuivants, see HERALD. In ancient times any great nobleman might\r\ninstitute his own pursuivant with his own hands and by his single\r\nauthority. The dukes of Norfolk had a pursuivant called _Blanch-lyon_,\r\nfrom the white lion in their arms; the pursuivant of the dukes of\r\nNorthumberland was styled _Espérance_ from the Percy motto, and Richard\r\nNevil, earl of Salisbury, had a pursuivant called _Egle vert_.\r\n\r\n=Purveyor.= A person employed to make purchases, or to provide food,\r\nmedicines, and necessaries for the sick.\r\n\r\n=Push.= To press against with force; to drive or impel by pressure; as,\r\nto push back an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Push.= An assault or attack; a forcible onset; a vigorous effort.\r\n\r\n=Put to the Sword, To.= To kill with the sword; to slay.\r\n\r\n=Puteoli= (the modern _Puzzuoli_). A celebrated seaport town of\r\nCampania, was situated on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Baiæ. A\r\ncolony from the neighboring Greek city of Cumæ founded it in 521 B.C.,\r\nunder the name of Dicæarchia. In the second Punic war the Romans\r\nfortified it, and changed its name into that of Puteoli. It was\r\ndestroyed by Alaric in 410, by Genseric in 455, and also by Totila in\r\n545, but was on each occasion speedily rebuilt. In the 9th century the\r\nLombard dukes of Benevento reduced it.\r\n\r\n=Putteeala.= A town of British India, capital of a dependent native\r\nstate of the same name, in Sirhind, on the Kosilla, 1023 miles northwest\r\nof Calcutta. It was taken possession of by the British in 1809, but the\r\nrajah retains the sovereignty, on condition of furnishing a certain\r\nnumber of troops in case of war to the British government.\r\n\r\n=Puzzuoli=, or =Pozzuoli=. See PUTEOLI.\r\n\r\n=Pydna= (now _Kitron_). A town of Macedonia, in the district Pieria, was\r\nsituated at a small distance west of the Thermaic Gulf, on which it had\r\na harbor. It was originally a Greek colony, but was subdued by the\r\nMacedonian kings, from whom, however, it frequently revolted. Toward the\r\nend of the Peloponnesian war it was taken after a long siege by\r\nArchelaus. It again revolted from the Macedonians, and was subdued by\r\nPhilip, who enlarged and fortified the place. It was here that Olympias\r\nsustained a long siege against Cassander, 317-16 B.C. It is especially\r\nmemorable on account of the victory gained under its walls by Æmilius\r\nPaulus over Perseus, the last king of Macedonia, 168 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Pylos=, or =Pilus=. In the southwest of Messenia, was situated at the\r\nfoot of Mount Ægaleos on a promontory at the northern entrance of the\r\nbasin, now called the Bay of Navarino, the largest and safest harbor of\r\nGreece. In the second Messenian war the inhabitants of Pylos offered a\r\nlong and brave resistance to the Spartans; but after the capture of Ira,\r\nthey were obliged to quit their native country with the rest of the\r\nMessenians. It again became memorable in the Peloponnesian war, when the\r\nAthenians under Demosthenes built a fort on the promontory Coryphasium,\r\na little south of the ancient city, and just within the northern\r\nentrance of the harbor (425 B.C.). The attempts of the Spartans to\r\ndislodge the Athenians proved unavailing; and the capture by Cleon of\r\nthe Spartans, who had landed in the island of Sphacteria, was one of the\r\nmost important events in the whole war.\r\n\r\n=Pyramids, Battle of the.= So called from having taken place close to\r\nthe large pyramids in the plain of Mummies, at Waardam, within a few\r\nmiles of Grand Cairo. A previous engagement had been fought on July 15,\r\n1799, between the Mamelukes under Murad Bey and the French army,\r\ncommanded by Bonaparte in person. On July 21, 1799, the second battle,\r\ncalled the “battle of the Pyramids,” was fought, when Bonaparte defeated\r\nthe Mamelukes under Murad Bey and thus subdued Lower Egypt.\r\n\r\n=Pyrenees, Battle of the.= The Pyrenees are a chain of mountains which\r\nseparate Spain from France, and are nearly 75 miles broad. Towards the\r\nclose of the Peninsular war, in 1813, these mountains were the scene of\r\nmany severe conflicts between the British troops under the Duke of\r\nWellington and the French forces under Marshal Soult. After the defeat\r\nof Joseph Bonaparte at Vittoria, Soult took the command of the French\r\narmies as _lieutenant de l’empereur_; and after addressing the beaten\r\nsoldiery in language that proved fatally unprophetic, he hastened to\r\nrelieve the beleaguered fortresses, and the result was “the battles of\r\nthe Pyrenees.” Pampeluna, Roncesvalles, Maya, Orthez, etc., were the\r\nseats of the principal struggles. For nine days the armies had been in\r\neach other’s presence; and in severe operations and desperate fighting\r\nthese days were unexampled. The allied casualties exceeded 7000\r\nmen,--and those of the French might be safely set down at 15,000.\r\n\r\n=Pyrgi.= Movable towers, used by the Greeks in scaling the walls of\r\nbesieged towns. They were driven forward upon wheels, and were divided\r\ninto different stories, capable of carrying a great number of soldiers\r\nand military engines.\r\n\r\n=Pyroboli.= Fireballs, used both by the Greeks and Romans. They seem to\r\nhave been the very same as the malleoli.\r\n\r\n=Pyrometer.= An instrument for determining the pressure of fired\r\ngunpowder by the registered compression of oil,--invented by Dr. W. E.\r\nWoodbridge, and used by him and Maj. Mordecai (U. S. Ordnance\r\nDepartment) in experiments at Washington Arsenal, 1854-55. It consists\r\nof a small hollow steel cylinder filled with oil and a piston which is\r\npressed inwards upon the oil by the powder gases. The piston has a small\r\nstem projecting inwards, which is guided by a tube in the bottom of the\r\ncylinder. A steel point presses against the stem and scratches a line\r\nupon it, when the piston is moved. The pyrometer is received by a hollow\r\nscrew-plug placed in the side of the gun at the point where the pressure\r\nis to be taken. This instrument is probably the most accurate and\r\ndelicate one ever invented for the purpose. In the experiments it\r\nrecorded certain vibrations in the column of gases, which have been\r\ngenerally neglected by theorists on the subject, but which are of great\r\nimportance to the life of the gun. It seems unfortunate that an\r\ninstrument which promised so much should have been allowed to fall into\r\ndisuse, if not almost oblivion.\r\n\r\n=Pyrotechny.= Is the art of preparing ammunition and fireworks for\r\nmilitary and ornamental purposes. (See AMMUNITION.) Military fireworks\r\ncomprise preparations for the service of _cannon ammunition_, and for\r\n_signal_, _light_, _incendiary_, and _defensive_ and _offensive_\r\npurposes. The term composition is applied to all mechanical mixtures\r\nwhich, by combustion, produce the effects sought to be attained in\r\npyrotechny. The preparations for the service of ammunition are\r\n_slow-match_, _quick-match_, _port-fires_, _friction-tubes_, and\r\n_fuzes_.\r\n\r\n_Slow-match_ is used to preserve fire. It may be made of hemp or cotton\r\nrope; if made of hemp, the rope is saturated with acetate of lead, or\r\nthe lye of wood-ashes; if made of cotton, it is only necessary that the\r\nstrands be well twisted. Slow-match burns from 4 to 5 inches in an hour.\r\n\r\n_Quick-match_ is made of cotton-yarn (candle-wick) saturated with a\r\ncomposition of mealed powder and gummed spirits; after saturation, the\r\nyarn is wound on a reel, sprinkled (dredged) with mealed powder and left\r\nto dry. It is used to communicate fire, and burns at the rate of one\r\nyard in thirteen seconds. The rate of burning may be much increased by\r\ninclosing it in a thin paper tube called a _leader_.\r\n\r\n_Port-fire_ is a paper case containing a composition, the flame of which\r\nis capable of quickly igniting primers, quick-match, etc. A port-fire is\r\nabout 22 inches long, and burns with an intense flame for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n_Friction-tube_ is at present the principal preparation for firing\r\ncannon; it has the advantage of portability and certainty of fire. It is\r\ncomposed of two brass tubes soldered at right angles. The upper, or\r\nshort tube contains a charge of friction-powder, and the _roughed_\r\nextremity of a wire loop, the long tube is filled with rifle-powder, and\r\nis inserted in the vent of the piece. When the extremity of the loop is\r\nviolently pulled by means of a lanyard, through its hole in the long\r\ntube, sufficient heat is generated to ignite the friction-powder which\r\nsurrounds it, and this communicates with the grained powder in the long\r\ntube. The charge of grained powder has sufficient force to pass through\r\nthe longest vent, and penetrate several thicknesses of cartridge-cloth.\r\n\r\n_Fuzes._--See FUZE.\r\n\r\n_Fireworks for Signals._--The preparations for signals are _rockets_ and\r\n_blue-lights_.\r\n\r\n_Signal-Rockets._--The principal parts of a signal-rocket are the\r\n_case_, the _composition_, the _pot_, the _decorations_, and the\r\n_stick_. The _case_ is made by rolling stout paper around a former. The\r\nvent is formed by choking one end of the case.\r\n\r\n_Composition._--A variety of compositions are employed for\r\nsignal-rockets; a mixture of nitre 12 parts, sulphur 2 parts, charcoal 2\r\nparts, is frequently used. The _pot_ is formed of a paper cylinder,\r\nslipped over and pasted to the top of the case; it is surmounted with a\r\npaper cone, filled with tow. The object of the pot is to contain the\r\ndecorations which are scattered through the air by the explosion which\r\ntakes place when the rocket reaches the summit of its trajectory; the\r\nexplosion is produced by a small charge of mealed powder. The\r\n_decorations_ of rockets are _stars_, _serpents_, _marrons_, _gold\r\nrain_, _rain of fire_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Stars._--The compositions for stars are, for _white_: nitre 7 parts,\r\nsulphur 3 parts, mealed powder 2 parts; for _red_: chlorate of potassa\r\n7 parts, sulphur 4 parts, lampblack 1 part, nitrate of strontia 12\r\nparts; _blue_: chlorate of potassa 3 parts, sulphur 1 part, ammoniacal\r\nsulphate of copper 1 part; _yellow_: chlorate of potassa 4 parts,\r\nsulphur 2 parts, sulphate of strontia 1 part, bicarbonate of soda 1\r\npart.\r\n\r\n_Serpents._--The case of a serpent is similar to that of a rocket; the\r\ncomposition is driven in, and the top is closed with moist plaster of\r\nParis. The composition is nitre 3 parts, sulphur 3 parts, mealed powder\r\n16 parts, charcoal ¹⁄₂ part.\r\n\r\n_Marrons._--Marrons are small paper shells, or cubes, filled with\r\ngrained powder, and primed with a short piece of quick-match.\r\n\r\n_Stick._--The stick is a tapering piece of pine, about nine times the\r\nlength of the case.\r\n\r\n_Blue Light._--A very brilliant bluish light may be made of the\r\nfollowing ingredients, viz.: nitre 14 parts, sulphur 3.7 parts, realgar\r\n1 part, mealed powder 1 part; the brilliancy depends on the purity and\r\nthorough incorporation of the ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Incendiary Fireworks._--Incendiary preparations are _fire-stone_,\r\n_carcasses_, _incendiary-match_, and _hot shot_.\r\n\r\n_Fire-stone_ is a composition that burns slowly, but intensely; it is\r\nplaced in a shell, along with the bursting charge, for the purpose of\r\nsetting fire to ships, buildings, etc. It is composed of nitre 10 parts,\r\nsulphur 4 parts, antimony 1 part, rosin 3 parts.\r\n\r\n_Carcass._--A common shell may be loaded as a carcass by placing the\r\nbursting charge at the bottom of the cavity, and covering it with\r\ncarcass composition, driven in until the shell is nearly full, and then\r\ninserting four or five strands of quick-match. This projectile, after\r\nburning as a carcass, explodes as a shell. See CARCASS.\r\n\r\n_Incendiary-match._--Is made by boiling slow-match in a saturated\r\nsolution of nitre, drying it, cutting it into pieces, and plunging it\r\ninto melted fire-stone. It is principally used in loaded shells.\r\n\r\n_Hot Shot._--See HOT SHOT.\r\n\r\n_Fireworks for Light._--The preparations for producing light are\r\n_fire-balls_, _light-balls_, _tarred-links_, _pitched-fascines_, and\r\n_torches_.\r\n\r\n_Fire-ball._--A fire-ball is an oval-shaped canvas sack filled with\r\ncombustible composition. It is intended to be thrown from a mortar to\r\nlight up the works of an enemy, and is loaded with a shell to prevent it\r\nfrom being approached and extinguished. The composition for a fire-ball\r\nconsists of nitre 8 parts, sulphur 2 parts, antimony 1 part. The bottom\r\nof the sack is protected from the force of the charge by an iron cup\r\ncalled a culob, and the whole is covered and strengthened with a\r\nnet-work of spun-yarn or wire, and then overlaid with a composition of\r\npitch, rosin, etc.\r\n\r\n_Light-ball._--These are made in the same manner as fire-balls, the\r\nshell being omitted.\r\n\r\n_Tarred-links._--Tarred links are used for lighting up a rampart,\r\ndefile, etc., or for incendiary purposes. They consist of coils of soft\r\nrope placed on top of each other, and loosely tied together; they are\r\nimmersed in a composition of 20 parts of pitch, and one of tallow; when\r\ndry, they are plunged into a composition of equal parts of pitch and\r\nrosin, and rolled in tow or sawdust.\r\n\r\n_Pitched-fascines._--Fagots of vine twigs or other very combustible\r\nwood, about 20 inches long and 4 inches in diameter, tied in three\r\nplaces with iron wire. They may be treated in the same manner and used\r\nfor the same purposes as tarred-links.\r\n\r\n_Torches._--A torch is a ball of rope impregnated with an inflammable\r\ncomposition, and is fastened to the end of a stick, which is carried in\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n_Offensive and Defensive Fireworks._--The principal preparations of this\r\nclass, employed in modern warfare, are _bags of powder_ and\r\n_light-barrels_.\r\n\r\n_Bags of Powder._--Bags or cases of powder may be used to blow down\r\ngates, stockades, or form breaches in thin walls. The petard was\r\nformerly employed for these purposes, but it is now generally thrown\r\naside. The effect of the explosion may be much increased by making three\r\nsides of the bag of leather, and the fourth of canvas, which should rest\r\nagainst the object.\r\n\r\n_Light-barrel._--A light barrel is a common powder barrel pierced with\r\nnumerous holes, and filled with shavings that have been soaked in a\r\ncomposition of pitch and rosin; it serves to light up a breach, or the\r\nbottom of a ditch.\r\n\r\n_Fireworks._--Ornamental fireworks are divided into fixed pieces,\r\nmovable pieces, decorative pieces, and preparations for communicating\r\nfire from one part of a piece to another. The different effects are\r\nproduced by modifying the proportions of the ingredients of the burning\r\ncomposition, so as to quicken or retard combustion, or by introducing\r\nsubstances that give color and brilliancy to the flame. The fixed pieces\r\nare _lances_, _petards_, _gerbes_, _flames_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Lances._--These are small paper tubes filled with a composition which\r\nemits a brilliant light in burning. See LANCE A FEU.\r\n\r\n_Petard._--Petards are small paper cartridges filled with powder.\r\n\r\n_Gerbe._--Gerbes are strong paper tubes or cases filled with a burning\r\ncomposition. The ends are tamped with moist plaster of Paris or clay.\r\nThe movable pieces are _sky-rockets_, _tourbillions_, _Saxons_, _jets_,\r\n_Roman candles_, _paper shells_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Sky-rocket._--Sky-rockets are the same as the signal-rockets before\r\ndescribed, except that the composition is arranged to give out a more\r\nbrilliant train of fire. Composition: 122 parts mealed powder, 80 parts\r\nnitre, 40 parts sulphur, and 40 parts cast-iron filings.\r\n\r\n_Tourbillion._--The tourbillion is a case filled with sky-rocket\r\ncomposition, and which moves with an upward spiral motion.\r\n\r\n_Saxon._--The Saxon is similar to the tourbillion; it has the appearance\r\nof a revolving sun.\r\n\r\n_Jets._--Jets are rocket-cases filled with a burning composition; they\r\nare attached to the circumference of a wheel, or the end of a movable\r\narm, to set it in motion.\r\n\r\n_Roman candles._--A Roman candle is a strong paper tube containing\r\nstars, which are successively thrown out by a small charge of powder\r\nplaced under each star. A slow-burning composition is placed over each\r\nstar to prevent its taking fire at once.\r\n\r\n_Paper Shell._--This piece is a paper shell filled with decorative\r\npieces, and fired from a common mortar. It contains a small bursting\r\ncharge of powder, and has a fuze regulated to ignite it when the shell\r\nreaches the summit of its trajectory.\r\n\r\n_Decorative Pieces._--Decorative pieces are _stars_, _serpents_,\r\n_marrons_, etc., described under the head of ROCKETS.\r\n\r\n_Preparations for communicating fire_ from one piece to another are\r\n_quick-match_, _leaders, ort-fires_, and _mortar-fuzes_. The leader is\r\na thin paper tube containing a strand of quick-match. See QUICK-MATCH,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Pyroxyline=, or =Pyroxyle=. Gun-cotton (which see).\r\n\r\n=Pyrrhic Dance.= The most famous of all the war-dances of antiquity; is\r\nsaid to have received its name from Pyrrhus, or Neoptolemus, the son of\r\nAchilles, and was a Doric invention. According to Plato, it aimed to\r\nrepresent the nimble motions of a warrior either avoiding missiles and\r\nblows, or assaulting the enemy; and in the Doric states it was as much a\r\npiece of military training as an amusement. Elsewhere in Greece, it was\r\npurely a mimetic dance, in which the parts were sometimes represented by\r\nwomen. It formed part of the public entertainments at the Panathenaic\r\nfestivals. Julius Cæsar introduced it at Rome, where it became a great\r\nfavorite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quadi.= A powerful and warlike German tribe, belonging to the Suevic\r\nrace, whose territories were situated between the Danube, the Bohemian\r\nmountains, and the river Marus. They make their first appearance in\r\nhistory in the 1st century as formidable foes of the Romans. Their\r\nbodies were covered with mail, consisting of plates of horn; their\r\nweapons were long spears; and each man had three swift horses for his\r\nuse in battle. Thus equipped, they commenced the practice of making\r\nrapid and sweeping raids into Pannonia, Mœsia, and other neighboring\r\nprovinces. Sometimes they routed the imperial forces which tried to\r\ncheck their inroads. At all times they returned home with their\r\npredatory spirit unbroken. No reverses in fact, however frequent, could\r\ndaunt those wild border troopers of the Danube. The emperors Marcus\r\nAurelius, Probus, Carus, and Valentinian I., defeated them without\r\nsubduing or crushing them. The last glimpse that we get of them in\r\nhistory shows them in company with other barbaric hordes, in 407,\r\noverrunning Gaul, and reveling in boundless havoc and slaughter.\r\n\r\n=Quadrant.= An instrument for measuring altitudes, variously constructed\r\nand mounted for different specific uses in astronomy, surveying,\r\ngunnery, etc., consisting commonly of a graduated arc of 90°, with an\r\nindex or vernier, and either plain or telescopic sights, together with a\r\nplumb-line or spirit-level for fixing the vertical or horizontal\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n=Quadrant, Gunner’s.= See GUNNER’S QUADRANT.\r\n\r\n=Quadrat.= Or to quadrat a gun, is to see it duly placed on its\r\ncarriage, and that the wheels be of an equal height.\r\n\r\n=Quadriga.= In antiquity, a car or chariot, drawn by four horses\r\nharnessed abreast. This chariot was used in battle and in triumphal\r\nprocessions.\r\n\r\n=Quadrilateral.= In military language, an expression designating a\r\ncombination of four fortresses, not necessarily connected together, but\r\nmutually supporting each other; and from the fact that if one be\r\nattacked, the garrisons of the others, unless carefully observed, will\r\nharass the besiegers, rendering it necessary that a very large army\r\nshould be employed to turn the combined position. As a remarkable\r\ninstance, and a very powerful one, may be cited the celebrated\r\nquadrilateral in Venetia, comprising the four strong posts of Mantua,\r\nVerona, Peschiera, and Legnago. These form a sort of outwork to the\r\nbastion which the southern mountains of the Tyrol constitute, and divide\r\nthe north plain of the Po into two sections by a most powerful barrier.\r\nNapoleon III., in 1859, even after the victories of Magenta and\r\nSolferino, hesitated to attack this quadrilateral.\r\n\r\n=Quadrille= (_Fr._). Small parties of horse richly caparisoned, etc., in\r\ntournaments and at public festivals. The quadrilles were distinguished\r\nfrom one another by the shape or color of the coats which the riders\r\nwore.\r\n\r\n=Quadruple Alliance.= Between Great Britain, France, and the emperor of\r\nGermany (signed at London, July 22, 1718); it obtained its name on the\r\naccession of the states of Holland, February 8, 1719. It guaranteed the\r\nsuccession of the reigning families of Great Britain and France, settled\r\nthe partition of the Spanish monarchy, and led to war.\r\n\r\n=Quadruple Treaty.= Concluded in London, April 22, 1834, by the\r\nrepresentatives of Great Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, which\r\nguaranteed the possession of her throne to Isabella II., the young queen\r\nof Spain.\r\n\r\n=Quaker-guns= (Fr. _passe-volans_). Were wooden pieces of ordnance which\r\nwere made to resemble real artillery. They subsequently were used in\r\nother countries, and placed in the embrasures of forts, in order to\r\ndeceive an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Quarrel=, or =Quarry=.

The expression\r\nseems to be derived from the use of the word “quarter” to designate the\r\nlodging of the particular warrior; to _give quarter_ to a prisoner being\r\nto send him to his captor’s quarter for liberation, ransom, or slavery.\r\nThe refusal of quarter is a terrible aggravation of the horrors of war,\r\nand is only at all justifiable towards an enemy who has been guilty of\r\natrocious cruelty himself, or of some flagrant breach of faith.\r\n\r\n=Quarter Arms, To.= In heraldry, to place the arms of other families in\r\nthe compartments of a shield, which is divided into four quarters, the\r\nfamily arms being placed in the first quarter. When more than three\r\nother arms are to be quartered with the family arms, it is usual to\r\ndivide the shield into a suitable number of compartments; and still the\r\narms are said to be _quartered_.\r\n\r\n=Quarter Guard.= The guard which is stationed in front of the centre of\r\nthe camp of each corps, at about 80 paces from it.\r\n\r\n=Quarter of Assembly.= The place where the troops meet to march from in\r\na body, and is the same as the place of rendezvous.\r\n\r\n=Quarter Upon, To.= Is to oblige persons to receive soldiers, etc., into\r\ntheir dwelling-houses, and to provide for them. In the United States no\r\nsoldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house without the\r\nconsent of the owner; nor in time of war, but in a manner to be\r\nprescribed by law.\r\n\r\n=Quarter-block.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Quartering.= In heraldry, the division of a shield containing many\r\ncoats.

He vacates his staff position when promoted to\r\nthe rank of captain, or at the discretion of the colonel. In the British\r\nservice the regimental quartermaster rises, with scarcely any exception,\r\nfrom the ranks. He has no further promotion to look forward to; but\r\nafter thirty years’ service in all--including ten as an officer--he may\r\nretire with the honorary rank of captain.\r\n\r\n=Quartermaster-General.= A staff-officer in the U. S. army, who has the\r\nrank of brigadier-general, and is at the head of the quartermaster’s\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n=Quartermaster’s Department.= This department provides the quarters and\r\ntransportation of the army, except that, when practicable, wagons and\r\ntheir equipment are provided by the ordnance department; storage and\r\ntransportation for all army supplies; army clothing; camp and garrison\r\nequipage; cavalry and artillery horses; fuel, forage, straw, and\r\nstationery. The incidental expenses of the army (also paid through the\r\nquartermaster’s department) include per diem to extra-duty men; of the\r\npursuit and apprehension of deserters; of the burials of officers and\r\nsoldiers; of hired escorts; of expresses, interpreters, spies, and\r\nguides; medicines for horses; and of supplying posts with water; and,\r\ngenerally, the proper and authorized expenses for the movements and\r\noperations of an army not expressly assigned to any other department.\r\nThe present organization of the quartermaster’s department consists of 1\r\nquartermaster-general, with the rank of brigadier-general; 3 assistant\r\nquartermaster-generals, with the rank of colonels; 8 deputy\r\nquartermaster-generals, with the rank of lieutenant-colonels; 14\r\nquartermasters, with the rank of majors; and 30 assistant\r\nquartermasters, with the rank of captains.\r\n\r\n=Quartermaster-Sergeant.= A non-commissioned officer who assists the\r\nquartermaster. He ranks among the regimental non-commissioned staff, and\r\nis appointed by the colonel of a regiment upon the recommendation of the\r\nquartermaster.\r\n\r\n=Quarters.= In military affairs, are, generally, the positions assigned\r\nto persons or bodies of men. In a more special sense, the quarters in\r\nthe army are the places of lodging assigned to officers or men when not\r\nactually on duty.\r\n\r\n=Quarters.= The encampment on one of the principal passages round a\r\nplace besieged, to prevent relief and intercept convoys.\r\n\r\n=Quarters, Choice of.= In the U. S. service, when officers arrive in a\r\ngarrison they shall have choice of quarters according to rank; but the\r\ncommanding officer may direct the officers to be stationed near their\r\ntroops. The commanding officer of a post cannot be displaced by his\r\nsenior who does not command, though assigned to the same post. An\r\nofficer who has made his choice of quarters cannot again displace a\r\njunior, unless himself displaced by a senior.\r\n\r\n=Quarters, Intrenched.= A place fortified with a ditch and parapet to\r\nsecure a body of troops.\r\n\r\n=Quarters of Refreshment.= The place where the troops that have been\r\nmuch harassed are put to recover themselves, during some part of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n=Quarters, Out of.= Beyond the prescribed limits.

These sights are used for giving elevations up to three\r\ndegrees; but especially for pointing a piece at a less elevation than\r\nthe natural angle of sight. Quarter-sights are not used in the U. S.\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Quarter-staff.= Formerly a favorite weapon with the English for\r\nhand-to-hand encounters; was a stout pole of heavy wood, about 6¹⁄₂ feet\r\nlong, shod with iron on both ends. It was grasped in the middle by one\r\nhand, and the attack was made by giving it a rapid circular motion,\r\nwhich brought the loaded ends on the adversary at unexpected points.\r\n\r\n=Quasi Officers.= See SURGEONS, ACTING-ASSISTANT.\r\n\r\n=Quatre Bras.= See WATERLOO.\r\n\r\n=Quatrefoil.= A heraldic bearing meant to represent a flower with four\r\nleaves.

The site of Quebec, originally\r\noccupied by an Indian village named Stadacona, was discovered by Jacques\r\nCartier in 1535; but the city was founded by Champlain in 1608. It was\r\ntaken from the French by the English in 1626, restored in 1632, and\r\nfortified in 1690. It remained in the possession of the French till\r\n1759, when in consequence of the victory of Wolfe, it was surrendered to\r\nthe British, and finally confirmed to them by the treaty of Paris in\r\n1763. Quebec was attacked by the American republicans in 1775, but the\r\nsiege was raised in the following year. Since then its capture has not\r\nbeen attempted.\r\n\r\n=Queen Anne’s Pocket-piece.= An ancient 18-pounder cannon at Dover,\r\nEngland.

The long pieces must be at least 20 feet long, and their\r\ndistance apart be a little less than the head diameter of the casks. The\r\nunder edges are beveled so as to give them a good bearing on the casks.\r\n\r\nIn default of square timber, poles may be used in the construction of\r\nthe frame. The string-pieces and transoms may be spiked or lashed at\r\ntheir points of junction.\r\n\r\nThe four exterior casks in the raft should be lashed to the frame,\r\notherwise they may be carried off by the current when the raft lurches.\r\nFor other kinds of rafts, see PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Raft, Prairie.= See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Rafts, Timber.= Employ the largest and longest timber, giving at least\r\n35 feet length to the raft. Shorter than this it will not have\r\nsufficient stability, but will be subject to dangerous oscillations,\r\nespecially in a rapid stream. Squaring the timber will be worse than\r\nuseless. Any irregularities, such as branches and knots, should be\r\ntrimmed off. The raft must be built in the water. Select a place where\r\nthere is little current, and where the bank slopes gently to the water.\r\n\r\nThe timber is then arranged in the position it is to have in the\r\nraft,--the butts alternately up and down the stream,--the upstream ends\r\nforming a right angle, salient up-stream.\r\n\r\nSuppose the case of a raft to be composed of 20 logs, 47 feet long, and\r\naveraging 12 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe first log is brought alongside the shore, and the end of a plank or\r\nsmall trunk of a tree is spiked to it, about 3 feet from each end; it is\r\npushed off a little, and a second log is brought up, under the transoms\r\nand in close contact with the first.\r\n\r\nThe second log is spiked like the first, and so on for each of the\r\nremaining logs; care being taken to alternate the butts, placing the\r\nwhistle ends up-stream with the bevel underneath, and to spike the\r\ntransoms perpendicular to the logs. When the current of the river in\r\nwhich the raft is to be used is very gentle, the up-stream ends may be\r\non a line parallel to the transom; but if rapid, they should form a\r\nright-angle salient upstream, the vertex being in the middle log.\r\n\r\nWhen the bank is too steep to admit of this construction, the trees may\r\nbe floated into their proper positions, lashed together, and the\r\ntransoms spiked on; if the logs are nearly of the same size, the centre\r\nof gravity will be near the centre of the raft.\r\n\r\nTwo additional transoms are spiked at equal distances from the centre of\r\ngravity of the raft, and at a distance apart equal to the width of the\r\nroadway or platform.\r\n\r\nThe transoms should be about 8 inches wide by 6 inches thick, and should\r\nhave a bearing on all the logs forming the raft. When a platform is to\r\nbe constructed on the raft, intermediate transoms are laid, and at a\r\ndistance apart depending on the strength of the planking. The size of\r\nthe platform must be regulated by the buoyant power of the raft. A\r\nsingle course of logs will not have sufficient power to sustain troops\r\nenough to cover its whole surface. When the raft is to be used in a\r\nbridge the two intermediate transoms are separated by a distance a\r\nlittle less than the length of the chess, and placed at equal distances\r\nfrom a point somewhat astern of the centre of gravity of the raft, in\r\norder to correct the downward action of the cable on the bow.\r\n\r\nFor use in a bridge, a raft should be able to sustain at least 15,000\r\npounds. The same expedients are employed for the anchorage of rafts as\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nRafts are sometimes constructed for flying-bridges in the form of a\r\nlozenge, the acute angles being about 55°,--so that when two of the\r\nsides are parallel to the action of the current, the up-stream side,\r\nwhich in this form is the only one acted on by the current, is in the\r\nmost favorable position.\r\n\r\n=Raguled=, or =Ragguld=. In heraldry, jagged or notched in an irregular\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n=Raguled, Cross.= One made of two trunks of trees without their\r\nbranches, of which only the stumps appear.\r\n\r\n=Raguly.= In heraldry, a term applied to an ordinary whose bounding\r\nlines are furnished with serrated projections.\r\n\r\n=Ragusa.= A town of Austria, formerly the capital of an independent\r\nrepublic which now forms part of the kingdom of Dalmatia, on a peninsula\r\non the east side of the Adriatic, and built in terraces on the side of\r\nMount Sergio, the upper streets communicating with the lower by a flight\r\nof steps. It is strongly fortified with citadels, forts, and walls. It\r\nwas taken by the Venetians in 1171, but became an independent republic,\r\n1358; was taken by the French in 1806, and given up to Austria in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Rahmanieh.= A town of Lower Egypt, situated at the junction of the Nile\r\nwith the canal of Alexandria, 25 miles southeast from Rosetta. The\r\nFrench, during their occupation of Egypt, made it a fortified station.\r\nIt was taken from them by the British in 1801.\r\n\r\n=Raid.= A hostile or predatory incursion, especially an inroad or\r\nincursion of mounted men; a sudden and rapid invasion by a cavalry\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n=Raillon= (_Fr._). A quarrel; a short arrow.\r\n\r\n=Rail-platform.= See PLATFORM.\r\n\r\n=Rails.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, SEA-COAST CARRIAGES.\r\n\r\n=Rain=, or =Rhain=. A town of Bavaria, 22 miles north from Augsburg,\r\nwhere the Austrian general Tilly received his mortal wound in 1632.\r\n\r\n=Raise.= Armies are _raised_ in two ways: either by voluntary\r\nengagements, or by lot or conscription. The Greek and Roman levies were\r\nthe result of a rigid system of conscription. The Visigoths practiced a\r\ngeneral conscription; poverty, old age, and sickness, were the only\r\nreasons admitted for exemption. “Subsequently” (says Hallam), “the\r\nfeudal military tenures had superseded that earlier system of public\r\ndefense, which called upon every man, and especially upon every\r\nland-holder, to protect his country. The relations of a vassal came in\r\nplace of those of a subject and a citizen. This was the revolution of\r\nthe 9th century. In the 12th and 13th another innovation rather more\r\ngradually prevailed, and marks the third period in the military history\r\nof Europe. Mercenary troops were substituted for the feudal militia.\r\nThese military adventurers played a more remarkable part in Italy than\r\nin France, though not a little troublesome to the latter country.” A\r\nnecessary effect of the formation of mercenaries was the centralization\r\nof authority. Money became the sinews of war. The invention of fire-arms\r\ncaused it to be acknowledged that skill was no less essential for\r\nwarlike operations than strength and valor. Towards the end of the\r\nMiddle Ages, the power of princes was calculated by the number and\r\nquality of paid troops they could support. France first set the example\r\nof keeping troops in peace. Charles VII., foreseeing the danger of\r\ninvasion, authorized the assemblage of armed mercenaries called\r\n_compagnies d’ordonnance_. Louis XI. dismissed these troops but enrolled\r\nnew ones, composed of French, Swiss, and Scotch. Under Charles VIII.,\r\nGermans were admitted in the French army, and the highest and most\r\nillustrious nobles of France regarded it as an honor to serve in the\r\n_gens d’armes_. Moral qualifications not being exacted for admission to\r\nthe ranks, the restraints of a barbarous discipline became necessary,\r\nand this discipline divided widely the soldier from the people. The\r\nFrench revolution overturned this system. “Now” (says Decker) “mercenary\r\ntroops have completely disappeared from continental Europe. England only\r\nnow raises armies by the system of _recruiters_. The last wars of Europe\r\nhave been wars of the people, and have been fought by nationalities.\r\nAfter peace armies remain national, for their elements are taken from\r\nthe people by legal liberations. The institution of conscription is\r\nevidently the most important of modern times. Among other advantages, it\r\nhas bridged the otherwise impassable gulf between the citizen and\r\nsoldier, who, children of the same family, are now united in defense of\r\ntheir country. Permanent armies have ceased to be the personal guard of\r\nkings, but their sympathies are always with the people, and their just\r\ntitle is that of skillful warriors maintained as a nucleus for the\r\ninstruction of their countrymen in the highest school of art.”\r\n\r\n=Raise a Blockade, To.= To remove or break up a blockade, either by\r\nwithdrawing the ships or forces employed in enforcing it, or by driving\r\nthem away or dispersing them.\r\n\r\n=Raise a Purchase, To.= To dispose instruments or machines in such a\r\nmanner as to exert any mechanical force required.\r\n\r\n=Raise a Siege, To.= To relinquish an attempt to take a place by\r\nbesieging it, or to cause the attempt to be relinquished.\r\n\r\n=Rajah=, or =Raja=. A hereditary prince among the Hindus belonging to\r\nthe warrior caste, or the Kshattriya. In later times it became a title\r\ngiven by the British government to Hindus of rank, and is now not\r\nuncommonly assumed by the zemindars, or land-holders; the title of\r\nMaharajah, or “great Rajah,” being in these days generally reserved to\r\nthe more or less independent native princes.\r\n\r\n=Rajpoots=, or =Rajputs=. Is the name of various tribes in India which\r\nare of Aryan origin, and either descended from the old royal races of\r\nthe Hindus, or from their Kshattriya, or warrior caste. They attained a\r\nhigh degree of power and renown just before the Mohammedan conquests in\r\nthe 12th century. In 1193 and 1194 the Rajpoot chiefs sustained more\r\nthan one defeat at the hands of the Mohammedans, and were deprived of\r\nall their possessions except the regions they now occupy. They came\r\nunder the protection of the English, from about the beginning of this\r\ncentury, when the Rajpoots proved unable to defend their country against\r\nthe Mahrattas.\r\n\r\n=Rake.= To enfilade; to fire in a direction with the length of; as, to\r\nrake the enemy’s ranks.\r\n\r\n=Rally.= To bring back to order troops that may have been dispersed, or\r\nhave retreated in a panic.\r\n\r\n=Rally.= To come into orderly arrangement; to renew order, as troops\r\nscattered or put to flight; to assemble; to unite.\r\n\r\n=Ram.= To push home the charge of a gun; also, the corresponding word of\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n=Ram, Battering-.= See BATTERING-RAM.\r\n\r\n=Ram Home, To.= To drive home the ammunition in a gun.\r\n\r\n=Ramillies.= A village of Brabant, Belgium, 28 miles southeast of\r\nBrussels, is memorable as the place near which one of the most important\r\nbattles of the War of the Spanish Succession was fought, May 23, 1706.\r\nIn this conflict the French forces were under the command of Marshal de\r\nVilleroy and the elector of Bavaria, while the Duke of Marlborough led\r\nthe troops of the allies. Villeroy, after a battle of three hours and a\r\nhalf, was defeated, with the loss of all his cannon, the whole of his\r\nbaggage, and 13,000 men in killed and wounded. The great result of this\r\nvictory was that the French were compelled to give up the whole of the\r\nSpanish Netherlands. About 4000 of the allies were slain in the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n=Rammer.= See IMPLEMENTS, and INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Rammer-head.= See IMPLEMENTS, and INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Ramnuggur.= A walled town of the Punjab, on the Chenaub, 62 miles\r\nnorthwest of Lahore. Here the Sikh army was defeated by the British,\r\nOctober, 1848.\r\n\r\n=Ramp.= An oblique or sloping interior road to mount the terre-plein of\r\nthe rampart.\r\n\r\n=Rampant= (_Fr._, literally, “raging”). In heraldry, an epithet applied\r\nto a lion or other beast of prey when placed erect on the two hind-legs,\r\nwith only one of the fore-legs elevated, the head being seen in profile.\r\nWhen the face is turned toward the spectator, the attitude is called\r\n_rampant gardant_, and when the head is turned backwards, _rampant\r\nregardant_. A lion _counter-rampant_ is one rampant towards the\r\nsinister, instead of towards the dexter, the usual attitude. Two lions\r\nrampant contrariwise in saltire, are sometimes also said to be\r\n_counter-rampant_.\r\n\r\n=Rampart.= To fortify with ramparts.\r\n\r\n=Rampart-grenades.= Grenades used to defend a rampart. Shells of large\r\nsize may be used, being rolled down the parapet. See GRENADE.\r\n\r\n=Rampart-gun.= A large gun fitted for rampart use, and not used for\r\nfield purposes.\r\n\r\n=Ramparts.= In fortification, are broad embankments or masses of earth\r\nwhich surround fortified places. A rampart forms the _enceinte_, or body\r\nof the place, and on its exterior edge the parapet is placed, while\r\ntowards the place it is terminated by the interior slope of the rampart,\r\non which _ramps_ are made for the easy ascent of the troops and\r\nmaterial. See BULWARK.\r\n\r\n=Rampier.= The same as rampart.\r\n\r\n=Rampire.= The same as rampart,--seldom used except in poetry.\r\n\r\n=Ramps.= Are inclined planes of earth serving as a means of\r\ncommunication between two levels. A ramp for a field-gun is 8 feet wide,\r\nand for short distances it has a slope of one-fourth to one-sixth. When\r\nthe distance is long the slope is increased to as much as one-twelfth.\r\n\r\n=Ramrod.= The rod of iron formerly used in loading a piece to drive home\r\na charge; but now used to clean the rifle.\r\n\r\n=Ram’s Horns.= In fortification, a kind of low works made in the ditch\r\nof a circular arc, which serves instead of tenailles.\r\n\r\n=Rancheros= (from the Spanish _rancho_, “comradeship”). Is the name\r\ngiven in Mexico to a mixed breed of Spanish and Indian blood, who\r\ninhabit the country, and may almost be said to live in the saddle from\r\ntheir youth; are splendid riders and hunters, and form the bravest part\r\nof the Mexican army,--its irregular cavalry. The importance of their\r\nservices was seen in the wars between Mexico and the United States. The\r\nrancheros are lank in frame, with brown, weather-stained faces and\r\nmuscular limbs, hardy, temperate, and always ready for the boldest\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n=Rancon= (_Fr._). The name of an old weapon, consisting of a long stake\r\nwith a sharp iron point at one end, and two blades or wings bent\r\nbackwards, and extremely keen.\r\n\r\n=Random.= Distance to which a missile is thrown or projected; range;\r\nreach; as, the farthest random of a missile weapon.\r\n\r\n=Random Shot.= A shot not directed or aimed towards any particular\r\nobject, or when the piece is elevated at an angle of 45° upon a level\r\nplane.\r\n\r\n=Range.= In artillery, is the horizontal distance from the muzzle of the\r\npiece to the first graze of the projectile. The extreme range is the\r\ndistance from the muzzle to where the projectile finally rests. The\r\nrange of a projectile may be extended without increasing the charge of\r\npowder, in the modes, viz.: 1st, by raising the piece to a higher level;\r\n2d, by giving its axis greater elevation; 3d, by _eccentric_\r\nprojectiles. Experiments have shown that if the centre of gravity be\r\nplaced directly above the centre of figure, the range is greatly\r\nincreased. The range increases with the angle of fire up to a certain\r\nlimit, beyond which it diminishes. The greatest range in _vacuo_ is at\r\nan angle of 45°. A mortar is usually fired at an angle of 45°, and the\r\ncharge is varied according to the range required. Mortars are sometimes\r\nfired at an angle of 60°, when the battery is situated very near the\r\nobject assailed, and it is desired that the shells may fall upon the\r\nmagazines of the besieged. It is evident that the higher projectiles are\r\nthrown, the greater the velocity they acquire in falling; besides, they\r\nstrike the object more directly and with increased violence.\r\nStone-mortars were sometimes fired at an angle of 75°, that, in falling\r\nfrom a great height, the stone might have the maximum force of\r\npercussion. Grenades should be thrown from mortars at an angle of 33°;\r\notherwise they will be buried in the earth, and their fragments will not\r\nbe sufficiently destructive. For tables of ranges, see Roberts’s\r\n“Hand-book of Artillery.”\r\n\r\n=Range, Point-blank.= See POINT-BLANK RANGE.\r\n\r\n=Range-finder.= An instrument for determining ranges. There are several\r\ndifferent principles which may be used. The distance may be measured,\r\n1st, by the visual angle subtended by objects of known height; 2d, by\r\nthe velocity of sound; 3d, the instrument may furnish a base-line in\r\nitself and solve a triangle in which the base and two adjacent angles\r\nare given. The term is also applied to instruments used to solve a\r\ntriangle, the base of which is obtained by outside means. Range-finders\r\nconstructed on the visual angle principle have been known for many\r\nyears. _Boulanger’s_ instrument uses the 2d principle. It consists of a\r\nglass tube closed at both ends filled with a liquid in which a small\r\numbrella-shaped piece of metal is submerged. The tube is held vertically\r\nin the hand, the metal slowly sinks to the bottom. When the flash of the\r\nenemy’s gun is seen, the tube is inverted and the metal moves towards\r\nthe other end. When the sound is heard, the tube is brought to the\r\nhorizontal. The distance through which the piece of metal has moved\r\ngives the range by means of a scale on the side of the tube. _Berdan’s\r\nrange-finder_ is an expensive instrument using the 3d principle. It is\r\nmounted on a wagon, and intended to accompany either foot-troops or\r\nartillery. It has found great favor in Germany. _Nolan’s range-finder_\r\nconsists of an instrument for automatically solving triangles. A similar\r\nthing was devised about 1870 by two American officers, Maj. Morgan of\r\nthe 4th Artillery, and Capt. Lorain of the 3d Artillery. The most\r\ningenious, complete range-finder has been proposed by Lieut. Gordon of\r\nthe 4th Artillery. He uses two fixed angles and a variable base-line\r\nsupplied by the instrument itself. The principal parts of Nolan’s\r\nrange-finder are: Two instruments for measuring angles, one tape-line,\r\nand one reckoning cylinder. Each of the two instruments consist of two\r\ntelescopes, which lie crosswise one above the other under an angle of\r\nabout 90°; the smaller of the two has a long arm, with a vernier at one\r\nend; to the other a sector is fastened, which is divided up into\r\ndegrees. By means of a screw, an angle of about 20° can be described by\r\nthe upper or smaller telescope. The reckoning cylinder consists of a\r\nsolid body and two rotating rings. The lower ring and the lower edge of\r\nthe body are divided into 100 equal parts. On the upper ring are the\r\nlogarithms of the figures, and on the upper edge of the body are the\r\nlogarithms of the signs, from 6″ up to 2° 15′.\r\n\r\nTo find the range, the instruments on their tripods are arranged at the\r\nend of the assumed base-line, which is perpendicular to the range; or\r\nthe instruments may be attached to the right and left guns of a battery.\r\nThe long telescopes are turned toward the object whose distance is to be\r\nfound; the smaller ones upon each other, and the cross-threads of each\r\nmade to cover the cross-lines on the leather disk through which each\r\nsmall telescope points. The coincidence obtained by directing the longer\r\ntelescope on the object, the two angles at the base are determined; the\r\nbase-line being measured, one side and two angles of the triangle are\r\nobtained. With this data recourse is then had to the reckoning cylinder.\r\nThe arrow marked “band” is set on the figure that corresponds with the\r\ndistance between the instruments or base-line,--say 34 yards; then set\r\nthe arrow on the lower ring on the figure corresponding with the angle\r\nfound through the instrument,--say 18°; then find the figure for the\r\nnumber of degrees of the other angle,--say 42° on the lower ring. Just\r\nabove that is the figure 60 on the other division of the lower ring;\r\ncoinciding with this on the lower edge of the upper ring is the\r\ndistance, 1320 yards. The bases used are from 30 to 40 yards for a range\r\nof 2000 yards and over.\r\n\r\n_Watkins’s range-finder_ and _Gautier’s telemeter_ are instruments which\r\nrequire a measured base-line. See TELEMETER.\r\n\r\n=Ranger.= One of a body of mounted troops, who were formerly armed with\r\nshort muskets, and who ranged over the country around, and often fought\r\non foot.\r\n\r\n=Ranging.= The disposal of troops in proper order for an engagement,\r\nmanœuvres, or march, etc.\r\n\r\n=Rank.= Range of subordination, degree of authority. The relative\r\nsituations which officers hold with respect to each other, or to\r\nmilitary things in general. Questions as to the positive or relative\r\nrank of officers may often be of the greatest importance at law, in\r\nconsequence of the rule, that every person who justifies his own acts on\r\nthe ground of obedience to superior authority must establish, by clear\r\nevidence, the sufficiency of the authority on which he so relies. There\r\nmay also be many occasions on which the propriety of an officer’s\r\nassumption of command, or his exercise of particular functions, or his\r\nright to share with a particular class of officers in prize-money,\r\nbounties, grants, and other allowances, may depend on the correctness of\r\nthe view taken by himself or others of his rights to a specific rank or\r\ncommand; and an error in this respect may expose him to personal loss\r\nand damage in suits before the civil tribunals. The regulation of\r\nmilitary rank is vested absolutely in Congress, which confers or varies\r\nit at pleasure. The will of Congress in this respect is signified by the\r\ncreation of different grades of rank; by making rules of appointment and\r\npromotion; by other rules of government and regulation; or is by fair\r\ndeduction to be inferred from the nature of the functions assigned to\r\neach officer; for every man who is intrusted with an employment is\r\npresumed to be invested with all the powers necessary for the effective\r\ndischarge of the duties annexed to his office. Rank and grade are\r\nsynonymous, and in their military acceptation indicate rights, powers,\r\nand duties, determined by laws, creating the different degrees of rank,\r\nand specifying fixed forms for passing from grade to grade and when rank\r\nin one body shall give command in another body; and also when rank in\r\nthe army at large shall not be exercised. Rank is a right of which an\r\nofficer cannot be deprived, except through forms prescribed by law. When\r\nan officer is on duty, the rank itself indicates his relative position\r\nto other officers of the body in which it is created. It is not,\r\nhowever, a perpetual right to exercise command, because the President\r\nmay, under the 62d article of war, at any time relieve an officer from\r\nduty; or an officer may be so relieved by arrest duly made according to\r\nlaw; or by inability to perform duty from sickness, or by being placed\r\nby competent authority on some other duty. But whenever an officer is on\r\nduty his rank indicates his command.\r\n\r\n=Rank.= A line of soldiers; a row of troops reckoned from side to side,\r\nor in breadth;--opposed to _file_. _The ranks_, the order of common\r\nsoldiers; as, to reduce a non-commissioned officer to the ranks. _To\r\nfill the ranks_, to supply the whole number, or a competent number. _To\r\ntake rank of_, to enjoy precedence over, or to have the right of taking\r\na higher place than.\r\n\r\n=Rank and File.= The body of soldiers constituting the mass of the army,\r\nand including corporals and privates. In a more extended sense, it\r\nincludes sergeants also, excepting the non-commissioned staff.\r\n\r\n=Rank, Brevet.= See BREVET.\r\n\r\n=Rank, Double.= A rank composed of front and rear files.\r\n\r\n=Rank, Honorary.= That which merely gives a title and precedence,\r\nwithout any command being attached to that rank.\r\n\r\n=Rank, Insignia of.= Are badges or distinguishing marks of office of\r\nhonor. In the army of the United States the rank of officers is\r\ndetermined by the insignia on the epaulettes and shoulder-straps, and is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“For the general commanding the army, two gold-embroidered stars of five\r\nrays, one on each side equidistant between the centre and the outer edge\r\nof the strap, and a gold-embroidered shield in the centre. For the\r\nlieutenant-general, three silver-embroidered stars of five rays, one\r\nstar on the centre of the strap, and one on each side equidistant\r\nbetween the centre and outer edge of the strap; the centre star to be\r\nthe largest. For the major-generals, two silver-embroidered stars, the\r\ncentre of each star to be one inch from the outer edge of the gold\r\nembroidery on the outer ends of the straps, both stars of the same size.\r\nFor a brigadier-general, the same as for a major-general, except that\r\nthere will be but one star instead of two. For a colonel, the same as\r\nfor a major-general, omitting the stars and introducing a\r\nsilver-embroidered eagle; cloth of the strap as follows: for the general\r\nstaff and staff corps--dark blue; artillery--scarlet; infantry--light or\r\nsky-blue; cavalry--yellow. For a lieutenant-colonel, the same as for a\r\ncolonel, according to corps, omitting the eagle, and introducing a\r\nsilver-embroidered leaf at each end. For a major, the same as for a\r\ncolonel, according to corps, omitting the eagle, and introducing a\r\ngold-embroidered leaf at each end. For a captain, the same as for a\r\ncolonel, according to corps, omitting the eagle, and introducing at each\r\nend two gold-embroidered bars. For a first lieutenant, the same as for a\r\ncolonel, according to corps, omitting the eagle, and introducing at each\r\nend one gold-embroidered bar. For a second lieutenant, the same as for a\r\ncolonel, according to corps, omitting the eagle. For a brevet second\r\nlieutenant, the same as for a second lieutenant.”\r\n\r\n=Rank, Local.= See LOCAL RANK.\r\n\r\n=Rank, Relative.= See RELATIVE RANK.\r\n\r\n=Rank, Single.= A rank of single files.\r\n\r\n=Rank, Substantive.= Is genuine rank, with all the command and\r\nauthority, as well as precedence, attaching to the title. For instance,\r\na regimental major possesses the substantive rank of major, while a\r\ncaptain and brevet major is only a substantive captain. It may be\r\nbriefly described as being the reverse of brevet rank.\r\n\r\n=Ranker.= One who ranks, or disposes in ranks; and one who arranges.\r\n\r\n=Ransack.= To plunder; to pillage completely; to ravage; as, to ransack\r\na city.\r\n\r\n=Ransom of Prisoners.= A prisoner of war, being a public enemy, is the\r\nprisoner of the government, and not of the captor. No ransom can be paid\r\nby a prisoner of war to his individual captor, or to any officer in\r\ncommand. The government alone releases captives, according to rules\r\nprescribed by itself.\r\n\r\n=Rapier.= Is said to have had distinct meanings at different times, and\r\nin ancient fencing to have been a long cutting broadsword; but for the\r\nlast century, at least, the rapier has been a light, highly-tempered,\r\nedgeless, thrusting weapon, finely pointed and about 3 feet in length.\r\nAt present, it is worn only on occasions of court ceremonial, and\r\nanswers no other purpose than to incommode the wearer. In war a rapier\r\ncould never have been of any service.\r\n\r\n=Rapine.= The act of plundering; the seizing and carrying away of things\r\nby force; spoliation; pillage; plunder. Violence; force; also, to\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\n=Rappahannock.= A river of Virginia, formed by the union of the North\r\nFork and the Rapidan, 40 miles above Fredericksburg. On the Rappahannock\r\nand the Rapidan occurred some of the most sanguinary battles of the war\r\nof Secession, at Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and the Wilderness.\r\n\r\n=Rapparee.= A wild Irish plunderer, so called from his being generally\r\narmed with a _rapary_, or half-pike. The term was in common use in the\r\n17th century.\r\n\r\n=Rappel.= The beat of the drum to call soldiers to arms.\r\n\r\n=Rarefaction.= The extension of the parts of a gas, by which it is made\r\nto take up more room than it did before.\r\n\r\n=Rasaldar.= In the East Indies, the name applied to the commander of\r\n_rasallah_, which is 10,000 armed horsemen.\r\n\r\n=Rasante.= A French term, applied to a style of fortification in which\r\nthe command of the works over each other, and over the country, is kept\r\nvery low, in order that the shot may more effectually sweep or graze the\r\nground before them.\r\n\r\n=Ras-el-Kyma.= A fortress in the Persian Gulf, and formerly the\r\nprincipal stronghold of the Joasmee pirates.

An important city of Central Italy, 43 miles\r\neast-southeast from Bologna, 4¹⁄₂ miles from the Adriatic. Augustus made\r\nit a first-class seaport and naval station. It was taken by Odoacer,\r\nthen by Theodoric, and by Totila; was subdued by the Lombards in 752,\r\nand their king, Astolphus, in 754, surrendered it to Pepin, king of\r\nFrance. In 1275, Guido da Polenta conquered it. Ravenna was afterwards\r\ntaken by the Venetians, who kept it till 1509. Under the walls of\r\nRavenna a battle was fought between the French under Gaston de Foix\r\n(duke of Nemours and nephew of Louis XII.) and the Spanish and Papal\r\narmies. The confederate army was cut to pieces. De Foix perished in the\r\nmoment of his victory, and his death closed the good fortune of the\r\nFrench in Italy. Ravenna became a part of the kingdom of Italy in 1860.\r\n\r\n=Ravine.= In field fortification, a deep hollow, usually formed by a\r\ngreat flood, or long-continued running of water; frequently turned to\r\nadvantage in the field.\r\n\r\n=Raw.= Unseasoned, unripe in skill, wanting knowledge in tactics.\r\n\r\n=Raw Troops.= Are inexperienced soldiers, or men who have been little\r\naccustomed to the use of arms.\r\n\r\n=Razant.= See RASANTE.\r\n\r\n=Razed.= Works or fortifications are said to be razed when they are\r\ntotally demolished.\r\n\r\n=Razzia.= A plundering and destructive incursion.\r\n\r\n=Readiness.= A state of alertness or preparation; thus, to hold a corps\r\nin readiness, is to have it prepared in consequence of some previous\r\norder to march at a moment’s notice.\r\n\r\n=Reading.= A town of England, in Berkshire, on the Kennet, 36 miles west\r\nby south from London.

In 1006 they again made their appearance,\r\nand burned the town. In the civil war of the 17th century Reading was at\r\ndifferent times in the possession of both parties, and suffered much\r\nduring the contest.\r\n\r\n=Ready.= In tactics, a word of command in firing, being a contraction of\r\n_make ready_.\r\n\r\n=Reamer.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF, BORING.\r\n\r\n=Rear.= In general acceptation, anything situated or placed behind\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n=Rear.= The direction opposite the enemy.

A chafing-dish, or pan used for various purposes,\r\nparticularly during a siege. Rechauds are filled with burning materials\r\nand hung in different parts of the walls, so as to throw light into the\r\nditches, and to prevent surprises.\r\n\r\n=Rechute= (_Fr._). Literally means a second fall; but in fortification\r\nit signifies a greater elevation of the rampart in those parts where it\r\nis likely to be commanded.\r\n\r\n=Recoil.= In gunnery, is the retrograde motion impressed upon cannon by\r\nthe discharge. The gas produced by the ignition of the charge in the\r\nbore, expanding with equal force in every direction, finds only two ways\r\nof escape (the muzzle and the vent); the pressure upon these points will\r\ntherefore cease while it will be proportionally increased upon the parts\r\ndirectly opposite, that is, the bottom of the bore and that portion\r\ndirectly opposite the vent, producing in the first case the recoil, and\r\nin the other, indirectly, the dipping of the muzzle. The distance of the\r\nrecoil depends entirely upon the nature and inclination of the ground\r\nupon which the carriage stands, the situation of the trunnions, angle of\r\nelevation, comparative weight of the gun and carriage, and upon the\r\nstrength of the charge. The recoil has no appreciable effect upon the\r\nflight of a projectile, the latter being expelled from the gun before it\r\nhas recoiled a fraction of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe recoil of heavy guns fired with large charges is a serious\r\nconsideration in gunnery. The recoil must be checked in a comparatively\r\nshort space, and yet checked too suddenly the shock destroys the\r\ncarriage as well as platform. Various methods have been tried. The\r\ntruck-wheels upon which the top carriage runs in and out of battery are\r\nprovided with eccentrics, which are thrown out of gear to produce\r\nsliding friction,--but this alone is not sufficient in most cases.\r\nCounter-mortars are sometimes clamped on the chassis-rail against the\r\ncarriage, but this is objectionable, as it tends to destroy the chassis.\r\nFriction-plates, with clamping attachments to the carriage between them,\r\nand extending full length of the chassis, have also been tried, but the\r\nbuckling of the plates soon ruined them. This plan has been recently\r\nrevived, and the buckling prevented by interposing india-rubber between\r\nthe rear ends of the plates and the transom of the chassis. For the most\r\napproved methods, see AIR-CYLINDERS and HYDRAULIC LOADING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n=Recommend.= To commend to the favorable notice of another.\r\nNon-commissioned officers of companies are appointed by the colonel upon\r\nthe recommendation of company commanders. Recommendation of members of a\r\ncourt-martial in favor of the person being tried, is introduced after\r\nthe finding and sentence are closed and authenticated. The\r\nrecommendation should distinctly set forth the reasons which prompt\r\nit.--_Hough._\r\n\r\n=Reconnoissance.= The reconnoitring or examination of any tract of\r\ncountry preparatory to the march of an army, in order either to take up\r\nquarters for the season, or commence operations against an opposing\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe _military reconnoissance_ of a country is generally performed under\r\nthe protection of an armed force. It is considered as one of the most\r\nessential operations connected with the tactics of the field, and serves\r\nas the basis of every movement or combination which it may be proposed\r\nto make. Those who are charged with this duty should be habituated to\r\nthe performance of topographical surveys; in the first place, by the\r\nmost accurate methods, and with the best instruments; and, secondly, by\r\nsuch methods as admit of being practiced rapidly, on foot or on\r\nhorseback. In these cases a compass held in the hand must be used for\r\nobserving the angles, and the distances must be obtained by pacing, or\r\nbe merely estimated by the eye. The nature of the roads should be\r\ndescribed with indications denoting that they are passable for\r\nartillery, for cavalry, or merely for infantry; and if defective,\r\nestimates should be made of the materials and time requisite for\r\nrepairing them. In contemplating rivers and marshes as means of\r\nretarding an advance of the enemy, it should be ascertained and reported\r\nwhether by being dry in summer, or frozen in winter, they may not at\r\ntimes cease to be obstacles. It should be also stated how, on a retreat,\r\nthe roads may be blocked up, the fords rendered impassable, or the\r\nbridges destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Reconnoitre.= To make oneself acquainted by personal inspection, as far\r\nas may be practicable, with the enemy’s position and movements; also, to\r\nsurvey, and draw in a rapid manner, ground of importance to operations\r\nof war, not represented in existing maps, with sufficient accuracy or\r\nminuteness; and likewise to particularize the banks of rivers, canals,\r\nstreams, mountains, passes, positions, villages, forts, and redoubts.\r\n\r\n=Record.= To preserve by committing to writing; to make official note\r\nof; as, to record the proceedings of a court.\r\n\r\n=Record.= An authentic copy; a statement of the proceedings of a court\r\nor board; a written history; an official account or register.\r\n\r\n=Recorder.= One who keeps a record; specifically, the officer who\r\nregisters the proceedings of a board or minor court.\r\n\r\n=Recover.= In tactics, a word of command in firing whereby the piece is\r\nbrought from the position of aim to that of ready.\r\n\r\n=Recreant.= Crying for mercy, as a combatant in the trial of battle;\r\nyielding; cowardly. Also, one who yields in combat, and cries craven;\r\none who begs for mercy; a mean-spirited, cowardly wretch.\r\n\r\n=Recruit.= To supply with new men, as an army; to fill up or make up by\r\nenlistment. Also, a person enlisted to make up deficiency in an army; a\r\nnewly-enlisted soldier.\r\n\r\n=Recruiting.= The act of obtaining men for service. The people of the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain resemble each other in their jealousy of\r\nlarge standing armies and their abhorrence of a system of universal\r\nservice, as well as in their warlike spirit and self-sacrificing\r\npatriotism. The organization of the English army, based upon voluntary\r\nenlistment, has been pronounced by foreign officers of thorough\r\neducation and acute observation as unworthy of scientific study,--that\r\nis, for home application, although the United States have borrowed a\r\ngreat deal from it,--in the writer’s opinion, to their detriment. In\r\nGreat Britain the whole recruiting has been placed under the immediate\r\ndirection of the adjutant-general since 1802. For this purpose, the\r\ncountry has been divided into recruiting districts, at the head of which\r\nis placed an inspecting field-officer with the duty of superintending\r\nall recruiting parties in his district, and of approving the recruits\r\nbrought. Staff-officers and sergeants of the Pensioner Force are also\r\noccasionally intrusted with the obtaining of recruits. The United States\r\nrecruiting service is conducted by the adjutant-general, under the\r\ndirection of the Secretary of War. Recruiting officers consist generally\r\nof captains and lieutenants of the line, who must not permit any man to\r\nbe deceived or inveigled into the service by false representations. If\r\nthe recruit is a minor, his parents or guardians must, if possible, be\r\ninformed of the minor’s wish to enlist, and their written consent\r\nobtained therefor. Any male person above the age of eighteen, and under\r\nthirty-five years, being effective, able-bodied, sober, free from\r\ndisease, of good character and habits, with a competent knowledge of the\r\nEnglish language, may be enlisted. No man having a wife or child can be\r\nenlisted in time of peace without special authority from the\r\nadjutant-general’s office. The Prussian system is based upon the theory\r\nthat military service is not a trade or craft, to be followed by a\r\nportion of the population, but a duty owed by every male citizen to his\r\ncountry. For further particulars of this system, see LANDWEHR. The\r\nPrussian system has been adopted by all other states of the German\r\nempire, and also by most of the other European nations.\r\n\r\n=Recruiting Flag.= See FLAG, STORM.\r\n\r\n=Recruitment.= The act or business of recruiting or raising new supplies\r\nof men for an army.\r\n\r\n=Recursant.= In heraldry, moving or coursing backward;--said of an eagle\r\ndisplayed with the back towards the spectator’s face.\r\n\r\n=Red Hand.= In heraldry, a sinister hand erect, open, and couped, or the\r\nwrist gules, being the arms of the province of Ulster, was granted to\r\nthe baronets of England and of Ireland as their distinguishing badge, on\r\nthe institution of that order in 1611, and is borne by the baronets of\r\nGreat Britain and of the United Kingdom. It is assumed into the armorial\r\ncoat, and may be borne upon a canton, or on an escutcheon, which may be\r\nplaced either in the middle chief or in the fess point, so as least to\r\ninterfere with the charges composing the family arms.\r\n\r\n=Red River Settlement.= Is in British North America, between Lakes\r\nSuperior and Winnepeg. While the proposed transfer to the crown\r\n(1869-70) of the rights of the Hudson’s Bay Company was pending, it was\r\nthe scene of much contention and violence. The hasty action of the\r\nCanadian authorities incensed the French-speaking population, who, led\r\nby Louis Riel, organized a force, imprisoned their opponents (English\r\nand Scotch), seized on Fort Garry, established a provisional government,\r\nrobbed the strong-box, and dictated terms to the governor of the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company, who was obliged to submit to them. In July, 1870,\r\na military force suddenly appeared in the province, and Riel fearing\r\ncapture, escaped, and thus closed the insurrection.\r\n\r\n=Red Tape.= The tape used in public offices for tying up documents,\r\netc.; hence, official formality.\r\n\r\n=Redan.= Is the simplest work in field fortification. It consists of two\r\nparapets whose faces join in forming a salient angle toward the enemy,\r\nlike a letter V, in which the apex is to the front. Regarded by itself,\r\nthe redan is a work of very little strength, since there is no flanking\r\nfire to protect its faces, and nothing to prevent an enemy from forcing\r\nan entrance at the gorge; but redans are useful in many positions, and\r\nthe rapidity with which they may be constructed renders them favorites\r\nwith engineers and generals. A row of redans along an exposed front of\r\nan army adds much to its strength, the troops behind protecting the\r\ngorge, and the redans flanking each other. It forms an excellent defense\r\nfor a bridgehead, the gorge being covered by the river. Redans figured\r\nlargely in Wellington’s works for defending Lisbon in 1810. The redan of\r\nSebastopol in 1855 was the principal point of the English attack, and\r\nthe scene of two bloody repulses by the Russians in June and September.\r\n\r\n=Redcoat.= A soldier who wears a red coat; an English soldier.\r\n\r\n=Red-hot Shot.= Are cannon-balls heated to redness, and fired from\r\ncannon at shipping, magazines, wooden buildings, etc., to combine\r\ndestruction by fire with battering by concussion. In modern warfare,\r\nshells containing molten iron are intended to be used in lieu of red-hot\r\nshot; but they have not yet been tested in actual practice, although a\r\nsimilar device was attempted unsuccessfully in 1863 by the U. S. forces\r\nwhen besieging Charleston.\r\n\r\n=Redinha.= A village of Portugal, province of Estremadura, the scene of\r\nan affair between the British under Lord Wellington, and the French\r\nretreating army under Marshal Masséna, in 1811.\r\n\r\n=Redoubt.= Is a small fort of varying shape, constructed for a temporary\r\npurpose, and usually without flanking defenses. The term is vague in its\r\nacceptation, being applied equally to detached posts and to a strong\r\nposition within another fortress. Redoubts are made square, pentagonal,\r\nand even circular. Each redoubt has parapet, ditch, scarps, banquette,\r\netc., as in regular fortification; but it is commonly rather roughly\r\nconstructed, haste and unprofessional labor precluding mathematical\r\naccuracy. The entrance may be by a cutting through the parapet, the\r\ncutting being covered within by a traverse, or, preferably, by an\r\nexcavated gallery leading into the ditch, and thence by a ramp through\r\nthe counterscarp. For the sake of flanking the ditch, and preventing an\r\nassaulting party from forming in it, caponnières of timber, loop-holed,\r\nare sometimes formed; or, if the soil be stiff or chalky, a gallery may\r\nbe cut behind the counterscarp, and loop-holed towards the ditch. In\r\nsome modern redoubts, the line of each side is broken to afford flanking\r\ndefense. Redoubts have the weak feature of not defending their own\r\nditches, and of being approached at their salient angles with\r\ncomparative impunity. They are therefore not adapted to a protracted\r\ndefense, but as temporary field-works, or in war of posts, they are\r\noften of incalculable importance. Troops whose stability in open field\r\nis doubtful are especially strengthened by redoubts in their line.\r\nRedoubts are particularly useful in fortifying the tops of hills, or\r\ncommanding passes, or where the object is to occupy a hostile territory,\r\nor to feel the way gradually through a wooded country.\r\n\r\n=Redoubtable.= Formidable; to be dreaded; terrible to foes; as, a\r\nredoubtable hero; hence, valiant; often in contempt or burlesque.\r\n\r\n=Redout Kalé=, or =Redoot Kalé=. A flourishing, fortified seaport of\r\nRussia, in Trans-Caucasia, stands on the eastern shore of the Black Sea,\r\nabout 15 miles north of Poti. During the Crimean war, the Russian\r\ngarrison at Redout Kalé, finding the fort invested by Sir Edmund Lyons,\r\nwith several men-of-war, set fire to the town, May 19, 1854.\r\n\r\n=Redressing Wrongs.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 29, 30.\r\n\r\n=Reduce a Place.= Is to oblige the commander to surrender it to the\r\nbesiegers, by capitulation. _To reduce the square_, is to restore or\r\nbring back a battalion or battalions, which have been formed in a hollow\r\nor oblong square, to their natural situation in line or column. _To\r\nreduce to the ranks_, is to degrade, as to reduce a non-commissioned\r\nofficer, for misconduct, to the station of a private soldier.\r\n\r\n=Reduce, To.= To degrade to a lower rank.\r\n\r\n=Reduced.= In a military sense, is to be taken off the establishment,\r\nand to cease to receive pay as soldiers. When a regiment is reduced, the\r\nofficers are generally put upon half-pay. Sometimes the corps are\r\nreduced, and the officers remain upon full pay. This happens at the\r\nclose of a war, when the standing army of the country is confined to a\r\ncertain number of battalions. Hence is derived the expression, _in_ and\r\n_out_ of the _break_. _In the break_, is the liability of being reduced.\r\n_Out of the break_, is the certainty of being kept upon the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n=Reduit.= In fortification, is a central or retired work within any\r\nother work, intended to afford the garrison a last retreat, whence they\r\nmay capitulate. It is commonly of masonry, loop-holed, and often\r\ncircular. Many engineers doubt the use of reduits altogether, as\r\nblocking up the working space, being themselves inconvenient for the\r\nmen, and incapable of protracted defense, while they frequently mask the\r\nfire of other works more to the rear.\r\n\r\n=Re-embark.= To embark or go aboard of a ship again.\r\n\r\n=Re-embattle.= To array again for battle; to arrange again in the order\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\n=Re-engage.= To engage again; to enlist a second time.\r\n\r\n=Re-enlist.= To enlist again. In the U. S. army any non-commissioned\r\nofficer, musician, or private soldier, who re-enlists within one month\r\nafter the date of discharge from first enlistment, receives $2 per month\r\nin addition to the monthly pay he was receiving prior to discharge; and\r\nalso $1 per month additional after each subsequent re-enlistment so long\r\nas he shall remain continuously in the army.\r\n\r\n=Re-enlistment.= A renewed enlistment.\r\n\r\n=Re-entering Angle.= See ANGLE.\r\n\r\n=Re-entering Place of Arms.= In fortification, is an enlargement of the\r\ncovered way of the fortress, between a bastion and a ravelin; its rear\r\ncoinciding with the counterscarp of the ditch, and its front consisting\r\nusually of two faces of the glacis, which are disposed at angles of\r\nabout 100° with the glacis before the neighboring bastion and ravelin.\r\nIt serves as a place for assembling troops previously to making sorties;\r\nand the fire from its faces serves to defend the approaches to the\r\nsalient parts in front of the collateral works.\r\n\r\n=Rees.= A town of Rhenish Prussia, 12 miles southeast from Cleves. This\r\ntown was taken by the Dutch in 1614, and by the French in 1678.\r\n\r\n=Reflection, Angle of.= Whether the instance be a ray of light or a\r\ncannon-ball, the angle of reflection will always be found equal to the\r\nangle of incidence.\r\n\r\n=Re-form, To.= In a military sense is, after some manœuvre or evolution,\r\nto bring a line to its natural order by aligning it on some given point.\r\nAlso, to restore order among broken troops.\r\n\r\n=Reformado.= An officer was formerly so called, who for some disgrace\r\nwas deprived of his command, but retained his rank, and perhaps his pay.\r\n\r\n=Reformed Officer.= In the British army, one whose troop or company\r\nbeing broken up, is continued on full or half-pay. He preserves the\r\nright of seniority, and continues in the way of preferment by brevet.\r\n\r\n=Re-fortification.= A fortifying anew, or a second time.\r\n\r\n=Re-fortify.= To fortify anew.\r\n\r\n=Refusal to Receive Prisoners.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 67.\r\n\r\n=Refuse, To.= In a military sense, is to refuse a wing, to throw it\r\nback, or to keep it out of that regular alignment which is formed when\r\ntroops are upon the point of engaging an enemy. _To refuse any part of\r\nthe line in battle_, as the centre or a wing, to keep that part retired,\r\nwhile the remainder is advanced to fight.\r\n\r\n=Regardant.= A term used in heraldry, with reference to an animal whose\r\nhead is turned backwards. See PASSANT and RAMPANT.\r\n\r\n=Regensburg.= See RATISBON.\r\n\r\n=Reggio= (anc. _Rhegium_, which see). A city in Southern Italy which was\r\ntaken by Garibaldi, August, 1860.\r\n\r\n=Regillus Lacus.= A lake in Latium, memorable for the victory gained on\r\nits banks by the Romans over the Latins, 498 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Regiment.= In all modern armies, is a colonel’s command, and the\r\nlargest permanent association of soldiers. Regiments may be combined\r\ninto brigades, brigades into divisions, and divisions into corps and\r\narmies; but these combinations are but temporary, while in the regiment\r\nthe same officers serve continually, and in command of the same body of\r\nmen. The strength of a regiment may vary greatly even in the same army,\r\nas each may comprise any number of battalions. French and Austrian\r\nregiments have ordinarily four to six battalions. Among British infantry\r\nthe smallest regiments are those numbered from the 26th upwards (except\r\nthe 60th), which, unless serving in India, have 1000 men each, composing\r\none battalion. Regiments in India have 1200 to a battalion. The largest\r\nregiment is the Royal Artillery, comprising 34,713 officers and men. The\r\nstrength of a regiment, however, is changed from time to time; usually\r\nby the addition or withdrawal of private soldiers. In the U. S. service\r\nthe strength of cavalry regiments is about 1200 men each, artillery\r\nabout 600, and infantry about 500 each. The regimental system could only\r\nexist where standing armies were maintained. Accordingly the Macedonian\r\nsyntagmata and the Roman cohorts were evidently regiments in a strict\r\nsense. During the Middle Ages, feudal organization precluded the system,\r\nand its first appearance was in France. Francis I. formed legions of\r\n6000 men each, which were divided into independent companies, the latter\r\nbeing, in fact, battalions, and each legion a regiment. The word\r\nregiment began to be applied to bodies of British troops in Elizabeth’s\r\nreign; regiments are spoken of at the time of the Armada, 1588, and as\r\ncomposing the force in Ireland, 1598. From that time forward the army\r\nand militia of Britain have been organized in regiments.\r\n\r\n=Regimental.= Anything belonging to a regiment.\r\n\r\n=Regimental Colors.= See COLORS.\r\n\r\n=Regimental Court-martial.= Is a legal tribunal convened for the\r\npunishment of offenders in the army. It is composed of three members and\r\na judge-advocate. See COURT-MARTIAL, JUDGE-ADVOCATE, and TRIAL.\r\n\r\n=Regimental Courts-martial.= See COURT-MARTIAL.\r\n\r\n=Regimental Inspection.= See INSPECTION.\r\n\r\n=Regimental Necessaries.= See NECESSARIES.\r\n\r\n=Regimental Orders.= See ORDERS, REGIMENTAL.\r\n\r\n=Regimental Schools.= In Great Britain, are educational establishments\r\nmaintained by the state in every regiment, for the instruction of\r\nsoldiers and soldiers’ children. There is a schoolmaster for the\r\nsoldiers and elder boys, and a trained schoolmistress--usually the\r\nschoolmaster’s wife--to teach the girls and infants of both sexes.\r\nAttendance at the schools is compulsory for the soldiers and optional\r\nfor the children. Religious instruction takes place on Monday mornings,\r\nwhen children can be kept from school if their parents object to the\r\ninstruction imparted. The girls’ school comprises an “industrial”\r\nsection for needle-work, etc.\r\n\r\nIn France, _écoles primaires_ or _regimentaires_, “primary or regimental\r\nschools,” were founded in 1818, in which the soldiers were taught\r\nwriting, reading, and arithmetic.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, there are established garrison schools (_Garnisons Schulen_)\r\nfor the instruction of soldiers’ children; and battalion schools\r\n(_Bataillons Schulen_), in which non-commissioned officers and privates\r\nare instructed in writing, reading, orthography, and arithmetic; also in\r\nmaking out reports and other official papers.\r\n\r\n=Regimentals.= The uniform worn by the troops of a regiment.\r\n\r\n=Register.= A list or roll; as, the army register; which is a list of\r\nthe officers, with rank and date of commission, etc.\r\n\r\n=Regulars.= Are those troops whose conditions of enrollment are not\r\nlimited to time or place, in contradistinction to militia or volunteer\r\ncorps; troops permanently in service.\r\n\r\n=Regulation Sword.= A sword of the kind or quality prescribed by the\r\nofficial regulations. Also regulation cap, uniform, etc.\r\n\r\n=Regulations.= Under the Constitution of the United States, rules for\r\nthe government and regulation of the army must be made by Congress.\r\nRegulation implies regularity; it signifies fixed forms; a certain\r\norder; method; precise determination of functions, rights, and duties.\r\n(See MILITARY REGULATIONS.) A “regulation” of an executive department is\r\na rule by the head of such department for its action, under a statute\r\nconferring such power, and has the force of law; a mere order of the\r\nPresident, or of the Secretary of the department, is not a regulation.\r\nThe power of the Executive to establish rules and regulations for the\r\ngovernment of the army is undoubted. The power to establish implies\r\nnecessarily the power to modify or repeal, or to create anew. The\r\nSecretary of War is the regular constitutional organ of the President\r\nfor the administration of the military establishment of the nation; and\r\nrules and orders publicly promulgated through him must be received as\r\nthe act of the Executive, and as such be binding upon all within the\r\nsphere of his legal and constitutional authority. Such regulations\r\ncannot be questioned or defied, because they may be thought unwise or\r\nmistaken. But as it sometimes occurs that rights of rank, command, and\r\npay, concerning which Congress has legislated, are subjects of dispute,\r\nand variable expositions of laws regulating those essentials of good\r\ngovernment have been by different Executives, with an increasing\r\ntendency to invalidate rank created by Congress; there should be a law\r\npassed by Congress to enable cases to be brought before the Federal\r\ncivil courts, in order that the true exposition of military statutes and\r\nauthorities in dispute may be determined. With such a remedy, laws,\r\nhowever defective they may be, would at least be known, and rights,\r\npowers, and duties, established by law would be well determined.\r\n\r\n=Regulators.= The popular name of a party in North Carolina, which arose\r\nin 1768, and had for its object the forcible redress of public\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\n=Reigate.= A town of England, in the county of Surrey. Its castle was\r\ndestroyed in 1648. Its church contains the tomb of Lord Howard, who\r\ncommanded the English fleet against the Armada.\r\n\r\n=Reign of Terror.= A term applied to a period of anarchy, bloodshed, and\r\nconfiscation, in the history of the French revolution, during which the\r\ncountry was under the sway of the actual terror inspired by the\r\nferocious measures of its governors, who had established it avowedly as\r\nthe principle of their authority. It commenced after the fall of the\r\nGirondists, May 31, 1793, and extended to the overthrow of Robespierre\r\nand his accomplices, July 27, 1794. Thousands of persons were put to\r\ndeath during this short time.\r\n\r\n=Reims.= See RHEIMS.\r\n\r\n=Rein.= A crack or vein in a musket-barrel.\r\n\r\n=Reinforce.= In gunnery, is the thickest part of the body of the gun, in\r\nfront of the base-ring or base-line; if there be more than one\r\nreinforce, that which is next the base-ring or base-line is called the\r\n_first reinforce_; the other the _second reinforce_. See ORDNANCE,\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF, MOLDING.\r\n\r\n=Reinforce.= To strengthen with new force, assistance, or support;\r\nespecially, to strengthen, as an army or a fort, with additional troops,\r\nor a navy with additional ships.\r\n\r\n=Reinforce Band.= Is at the junction of the first and second reinforces.\r\n\r\n=Reinforcement.= The act of reinforcing. That which reinforces;\r\nadditional force; especially additional troops or force to augment the\r\nstrength of an army, or ships to strengthen a navy.\r\n\r\n=Reitres= (_Fr._). A body of armed horsemen, who came out of Germany and\r\nentered the French service during the reign of Henry III. They were\r\nincorporated with the carabineers.\r\n\r\n=Rejoin.= To join again; to return; as, the officer rejoined his\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n=Rejoinder.= In military law, the defendant’s answer to the plaintiff’s\r\nreplication. The weight of authority is against permitting a rejoinder\r\non the part of the prisoner, unless evidence has been adduced in the\r\nreply of the prosecutor. But such evidence should not be permitted in\r\nreply, and there should be no rejoinder.--_Hough’s “Military Law\r\nAuthorities.”_\r\n\r\n=Relais= (_Fr._). A term used in fortification to signify a space,\r\ncontaining some feet in breadth, which is between the foot of the\r\nrampart and the scarp of the fosse. It serves as a convenient receptacle\r\nfor the earth that occasionally crumbles off.\r\n\r\n=Relative Rank.= Signifies the comparative rank, as regards precedence,\r\netc. The following is the relative rank of officers in the army and navy\r\nof the United States:\r\n\r\n         Army.               Navy.\r\n  General               Admiral.\r\n  Lieutenant-general    Vice-admiral.\r\n  Major-general         Rear-admiral.\r\n  Brigadier-general     Commodore.\r\n  Colonel               Captain.\r\n  Lieutenant-colonel    Commander.\r\n  Major                 Lieut.-commander.\r\n  Captain               Lieutenant.\r\n  First lieutenant      Master.\r\n  Second lieutenant     Ensign.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the marine corps are of rank corresponding to that of\r\nthose of the same titles in the army.\r\n\r\n=Release of Prisoners.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 69.\r\n\r\n=Relief.= A fresh detachment of troops, ordered to replace those already\r\nupon duty. Also, the body of men proceeding to take the places of, or\r\n_relieve_, the existing sentinels. Guards are usually divided into three\r\n_reliefs_. See GUARD, RUNNING.\r\n\r\n=Relief.= In fortification, is the height to which works are raised\r\nabove the bottom of the ditch. If the works are high and commanding,\r\nthey are said to have a bold _relief_; but if the reverse, they are said\r\nto have a low _relief_. The _relief_ should provide the requisite\r\nelevations for the musketry and artillery, to insure a good defense.\r\n\r\n=Relieve, To.= Is to take a man or a body of men off any kind of duty;\r\nas, to relieve a sentinel; to relieve the guard, etc.; also to succor,\r\nto deliver; as, to relieve a besieged town.\r\n\r\n=Reliever.= An iron ring fixed to a handle, by means of a socket, so as\r\nto be at right angles to it. It serves to disengage the searcher of a\r\ngun, when one of its points is retained in a hole, and cannot be\r\nextracted otherwise.\r\n\r\n=Relieving the Enemy.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 45.\r\n\r\n=Reload.= To load anew, as a gun, etc.\r\n\r\n=Reloading Implements.= Are implements used in reloading\r\ncartridge-shells,--to perform the various operations of measuring the\r\npowder, setting home the bullet or charge, removing exploded primer,\r\nrecapping, etc.\r\n\r\n=Remaining Velocity.= In gunnery, is the velocity of the projectile at\r\nany point of the flight.\r\n\r\n=Remand.= To send back; as when a soldier who has been discharged from\r\nprison or the guard-house, for the purpose of being examined or tried,\r\nis sent back to await the final decision of his case.\r\n\r\n=Remarks.= Army returns, regimental returns, guard reports, etc., have a\r\ncolumn allotted for observations relative to extraordinary occurrences,\r\nand these are headed “remarks.” The word is also applied with reference\r\nto a reviewing officer’s observations on the verdict of a court-martial.\r\n\r\n=Remblai.= Is the quantity of earth in the mass of rampart, parapet, and\r\nbanquette.\r\n\r\n=Remedy.= The rules and articles for the government of the army are\r\ndefective in not providing sufficient remedies for wrongs. The army of\r\nthe United States is governed by law. The law should therefore provide a\r\nsufficient remedy for cases in which the rights of officers are wrested\r\nfrom them by illegal regulations, purporting to interpret the true\r\nmeaning of acts of Congress. In cases arising in the land and naval\r\nforces of the United States, where the true construction of any act of\r\nCongress is in dispute, legislation is wanted to enable an officer who\r\nthinks himself wronged by an illegal executive decision, to bring the\r\nmatter before the Federal civil courts to determine the true exposition\r\nof the statute or authority in dispute.\r\n\r\n=Remi=, or =Rhemi=. One of the most powerful people in Gallia Belgica.\r\nThey formed an alliance with Cæsar when the rest of the Belgæ made war\r\nagainst him, 57 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Remington Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Remit.= To lessen; as, to remit a part of a soldier’s sentence.\r\n\r\n=Remonstrate.= To make a representation of a case or cases wherein one\r\nor more may consider themselves to be aggrieved. Military men may\r\nremonstrate through their superior officers; but where the duty of the\r\nservice is concerned, that duty must be first performed with\r\ncheerfulness and fidelity.\r\n\r\n=Remount.= A supply of good and serviceable horses for the cavalry. _To\r\nremount the cavalry_, is to furnish them with horses in the room of\r\nthose which have been either killed, disabled, or cast.\r\n\r\n=Renchen.= A town of Baden, on the Rench, 8 miles northeast from\r\nOffenburg. The French defeated the Austrians here in 1796, and entered\r\nSuabia.\r\n\r\n=Rendezvous.= A place appointed for a meeting; especially, the appointed\r\nplace for troops, or for the ships of a fleet, to assemble; sometimes a\r\nplace for enlistment. Also, to assemble or meet at a particular place,\r\nas troops, ships, etc.\r\n\r\n=Rendsburg.= A fortified town of Holstein, on an island in the Eyder, at\r\nthe commencement of the Kiel Canal. It was taken by the Imperialists in\r\n1627; by the Swedes in 1643; and by the Prussians and confederate troops\r\nin 1848. It was reoccupied by the Danes in 1852, and taken by the\r\nPrussians after a serious conflict, July 21, 1864.\r\n\r\n=Renegade.= One who deserts from a military or naval post; a deserter.\r\n\r\n=Rennes= (anc. _Condate_). A town of France, capital of the department\r\nof Ille-et-Vilaine, 60 miles north of Nantes. After the fall of the\r\nRoman empire it fell into the hands of the Franks. In 1357, Rennes was\r\nunsuccessfully besieged by the Duke of Lancaster; and at the time of the\r\nrevolution was the scene of some conflicts, being always firmly attached\r\nto the popular cause.\r\n\r\n=Reorganize.= To organize anew; to reduce again to an organized\r\ncondition; to cause to assume wonted or regular functions; as, to\r\nreorganize an army.\r\n\r\n=Repair of Arms.= The keeping in constant good order the different\r\nfire-arms belonging to a troop or company, such as rifles, etc. In the\r\nBritish army, a half-yearly allowance is made to captains of troops and\r\ncompanies for this purpose. In the U. S. service the cost of repairs of\r\ndamage done to arms, equipments, etc., through negligence of an officer\r\nor soldier, is deducted from the pay of said officer or soldier.\r\n\r\n=Repeater.= A fire-arm that may be discharged many times in quick\r\nsuccession; especially, a form of fire-arm so constructed that the\r\ncharges are successively introduced, by an action of the lock, from a\r\nchamber containing them, into the breech, and fired or are discharged\r\nfrom a revolving chamber at the breech. See REVOLVER and MAGAZINE GUN.\r\n\r\n=Repel.= To drive back; to force to return; to check the advance of; to\r\nrepulse; as, to repel an enemy or an assailant.\r\n\r\n=Reply.= It is the duty of a court to prevent new matter from being\r\nintroduced into the prosecution or defense, but a prisoner may urge in\r\nhis defense mitigating circumstances, or examine witnesses as to\r\ncharacter or services, and produce testimonials of such facts, without\r\nits being considered new matter. If any point of law be raised, or any\r\nmatter requiring explanation, the judge-advocate may explain. No other\r\nreply to be admitted.--_Hough._\r\n\r\n=Report.= Sound; loud noise, as that made by the discharge of a rifle or\r\na cannon.\r\n\r\n=Report.= A specific statement of any particular occurrences. Officers\r\nmaking written reports are required to sign them, specifying the\r\nregiment to which they belong, and their rank.\r\n\r\n=Reporting Prisoners.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 68.\r\n\r\n=Repose, In= (Fr. _en repos_). This term, which is manifestly taken from\r\nthe French, applies to troops that are allowed to be stationary for any\r\ngiven period during an active campaign, either through sickness or from\r\nsome other cause. Thus, the 5th regiment being in repose, the 24th was\r\nordered to the front.\r\n\r\n=Repository.= A place, or repertory, in which anything is preserved.\r\nThus, the British repository at Woolwich contains models of every sort\r\nof warlike stores, weapons, and fortifications; whether invented by\r\nofficers of the army or civilians, as well of other nations as of\r\nBritain, receipts being given to preserve the title to the inventor.\r\n\r\n=Repress.= To press back or down effectually; to crush down or out; to\r\nquell; to subdue; as, to repress rebellion.\r\n\r\n=Reprimand.= A reproof for some error or misconduct. A reprimand is\r\nsometimes publicly conveyed to officers, either in orders or at the head\r\nof a regiment, by direction of the President or a general officer in\r\ncommand. Non-commissioned officers and privates are sometimes\r\nreprimanded. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 52.\r\n\r\n=Reprisal.= Is the retaking, from an enemy, goods which he has seized,\r\nor the capture from him of other goods, as an equivalent for the damage\r\nhe has wrought.\r\n\r\n=Reproachful or Provoking Speeches.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 25.\r\n\r\n=Repulse.= To repel; to beat or drive back. The condition of being\r\nrepelled or driven back. Also, the act of repelling or driving back.\r\n\r\n=Requisitions.= Are forms prescribed for the demand of certain\r\nallowances, as forage, rations, etc. It also signifies the act of\r\nexacting either men or things for the public service. Requisitions are,\r\nhowever, an uncertain and unequal means of supply and only enable an\r\narmy to live from hand to mouth, and although practicable in offensive\r\nwars, are only justifiable in rapid movements, where time does not admit\r\nthe employment of more certain means of supply. The system is less\r\nodious than pillage. Bonaparte skillfully adopted another method, in\r\nharmony with the spirit of wars of invasion, and also more reliable as a\r\nmeans of support. He substituted himself in place of the supreme\r\nauthorities of the invaded country, and exacted _pecuniary\r\ncontributions_, paying, or promising to pay, for all provisions and\r\nother supplies needed for his army. This system was well executed by\r\nMarshal Suchet in Spain, and a similar system was also matured and\r\npublished in orders by Gen. Scott while in Mexico. A treaty of peace,\r\nhowever, soon after was made, which put an end to military operations,\r\nand the system was therefore only partially executed. But with a\r\nsufficient army in a fertile country, the experience of the world has\r\nshown that if the inhabitants are protected from injuries, they will\r\nvery generally sell to the best paymasters. It is therefore the interest\r\nof an invading army not to interfere with the ordinary avocations of\r\ncitizens, and such is the modern usage.\r\n\r\n=Rereward.= The part of an army that marches in the rear, as the guard;\r\nthe rear-guard.\r\n\r\n=Resaca de la Palma.= A ravine which crosses the Matamoras road about 3\r\nmiles north of that place; the position taken by the Mexican general\r\nArista to resist the further advance of Gen. Taylor’s army. Although the\r\nlatter was outnumbered three to one, the Mexicans were routed after a\r\nshort conflict (May 9, 1846) and driven across the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n=Rescue.= The retaking by a party captured of a prize made by the enemy.\r\n\r\n=Reservation, Military.= Land set aside from the public domain by the\r\nPresident of the United States for military purposes.\r\n\r\n=Reserve.= In army affairs, is a body of troops held somewhere in the\r\nrear, generally out of fire, and kept fresh, in order that they may\r\ninterfere with decisive force at any point where yielding troops require\r\nsupport, or an advantage gained needs powerful following up. The reserve\r\nof ammunition is a magazine of warlike stores, situated between an army\r\nand its base of operations, sufficiently retired from the front to be\r\nsafe from sudden raids of the enemy, and at the same time advanced\r\nenough to allow of the supply actually in the field being speedily\r\nreplenished.\r\n\r\n=Reserve, Army.= In Great Britain, is divided into first and second\r\nclass reserves. The first class consists of men who are serving or have\r\nserved in the regular army, and whose past service has not exceeded\r\ntheir first term of enlistment. These men are liable to be called out\r\nfor training for a period not longer than twelve days in a year, and to\r\nbe permanently embodied for general service in case of imminent national\r\ndanger or great emergency. The second class consists of out-pensioners\r\nof Chelsea Hospital, and persons enrolled in the force under the\r\nprovisions of the 6th, 7th, 9th, and 10th Victoria. The members of this\r\nforce may be called out for training as if they were in the first class,\r\nbut can only be permanently embodied in case of national danger or great\r\nemergency, for service in the United Kingdom. For army reserve in\r\nPrussia, see LANDWEHR.\r\n\r\n=Reserve Equipage.= See PONTONS, BRIDGE EQUIPAGE.\r\n\r\n=Ressaldar.= In the East Indies, is a native officer in a native cavalry\r\nregiment. He commands the right troop of a squadron, and on parade leads\r\nthe squadron.\r\n\r\n=Ressaldar Major.= In the East Indies, is the native commandant of a\r\nnative cavalry regiment.\r\n\r\n=Rest.= In tactics, a word of command whereby the men are brought to a\r\nposition of rest; as, parade rest, in place rest.\r\n\r\n=Rest on Arms.= A word of command which is used at military funerals.\r\n\r\n=Retained Pay.= In the U. S. army, is pay that is retained from the\r\nsoldier until the expiration of his term of service.\r\n\r\n=Retainers.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 63.\r\n\r\n=Retaliation.= This should never be resorted to as a measure of mere\r\nrevenge, but only as a means of protective retribution, and, moreover,\r\ncautiously and unavoidably; that is to say, retaliation is only to be\r\nresorted to after careful inquiry into the real occurrence and the\r\ncharacter of the misdeeds that may demand retribution.\r\n\r\n=Retiarius.= A kind of gladiator who fought in the amphitheatre during\r\nthe time of the Romans. He was dressed in a short coat, having a\r\n_fuscina_, or trident, in his left hand, and a net, from which he\r\nderived his name, in his right. With this he endeavored to entangle his\r\nadversary, that he might then with his trident easily dispatch him. On\r\nhis head he wore only a hat tied under his chin with a broad ribbon.\r\n\r\n=Retinue.= Applied strictly to the admiral’s suite or followers, though\r\nit means an accompanying train in general; whether military, naval, or\r\ncivil.\r\n\r\n=Retirade.= In fortification, a retrenchment, which is generally made\r\nwith two faces, forming a re-entrant angle, and is thrown up in the body\r\nof a work, for the purpose of receiving troops, who may dispute the\r\nground inch by inch.\r\n\r\n=Retire.= Signifies to fall back a short distance. Also, a bugle-sound\r\nintimating to skirmishers that they are to fall back. This bugle-sound\r\nin the U. S. service is termed “to the rear.”\r\n\r\n=Retired Flank.= In fortification, a flank having an arc of a circle\r\nwith its convexity turned toward the place.\r\n\r\n=Retired Full Pay.= See FULL PAY, RETIRED.\r\n\r\n=Retired List.= Is a list of officers retired from the army or navy. In\r\nevery service, to maintain a reasonably low age among the persons\r\nactively employed, it is essential that some scale should be fixed for\r\nretirement of old and worn-out officers. In the British army, medical\r\nofficers are allowed to retire after twenty-five years full-pay service;\r\nother officers after thirty years on full pay, or twenty-five years on\r\nhalf-pay. In the navy, officers are placed on the retired list at sixty\r\nyears of age, with the rank they then hold. In most cases, in both\r\nservices, the retiring officer is allowed a step of honorary rank; but\r\nthis higher rank carries neither present nor prospective advantage.\r\nOfficers of the U. S. army may be retired on their own application after\r\nthirty years’ service. If an officer has been borne on the army register\r\nfor forty-five years, or if he has attained the age of sixty-two years,\r\nhe may be retired at the discretion of the President. Officers retired\r\nfrom active service receive 75 per cent. of the pay of the rank upon\r\nwhich they were retired. Retired officers of the army may be assigned to\r\nduty as professors of colleges and at the Soldier’s Home, and shall not\r\nbe assignable to any other duty. Any officer may be retired on account\r\nof disability contracted in the line of duty. When an officer has served\r\nforty years as a commissioned officer he shall, if he makes application\r\ntherefor, be placed on the retired list. Officers retired shall be\r\nwithdrawn from command and promotion. Officers may be wholly retired for\r\ndisability not incident to the service and dropped from the rolls of the\r\narmy with one year’s pay. Officers of the marine corps shall be retired\r\nin the same manner and with the same relative conditions as are provided\r\nfor officers of the army.\r\n\r\n=Retreat.= The retrograde movement of any army or body of men who retire\r\nfrom the enemy. It signifies a more prolonged and systematic movement to\r\nthe rear than retire. _Full retreat_ is when an army retires with all\r\nexpedition before a conquering enemy. The retreat is also a beat of the\r\ninfantry drums, or sounding of the bugles or trumpets, which takes place\r\nevery day at sunset, and at which troops fall in and the roll is called;\r\nthe details for duty the following day, and orders, are published. _To\r\nretreat_ is to make a retrograde movement. An army or body of men are\r\nsaid to retreat when they turn their backs upon the enemy, or are\r\nretiring from the ground they occupied; hence, every march in\r\nwithdrawing from an enemy is called a retreat.\r\n\r\n=Retreat of the Ten Thousand Greeks.= The 10,000 Greeks who had joined\r\nthe army of the Younger Cyrus in his revolt against his brother,\r\nArtaxerxes Mnemon, were victors, but Cyrus was defeated and slain at\r\nCunaxa, 401 B.C. Artaxerxes having enticed the Greek leaders into his\r\npower and killed them, Xenophon was called to the command of his\r\ncountrymen. Under continual alarms from sudden attacks, he led them\r\nacross rapid rivers, through vast deserts, over the tops of mountains,\r\ntill he reached the sea. The Greeks returned home after a march of 1155\r\nparasangs, or leagues (3465 miles), which was performed in 215 days,\r\nafter an absence of fifteen months.\r\n\r\n=Retrench.= To furnish with a retrenchment; as, to retrench bastions.\r\n\r\n=Retrenchment.= In fortification, is a defensive work, comprising at\r\nleast ditch and parapet, within some other work of a fortress, and\r\nintended as a place of retreat for the defenders, whence they may\r\nprolong the defense, or capitulate after the faces of the work itself\r\nhave fallen into the enemy’s hands. The retrenchment bears a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the _reduit_, except that it is almost\r\nalways of earth. Retrenchments are made in ravelins, and the re-entering\r\n_place d’armes_ at the time of constructing the works. A retrenchment\r\nis thrown across the gorge of a redan or bastion, or from shoulder to\r\nshoulder, when it is apprehended that the salient angle will fall into\r\nthe possession of the besiegers; these retrenchments are usually made\r\nwhen wanted. Such a retrenchment across the interior of the Redan at\r\nSebastopol caused the sanguinary repulse of the British on September 8,\r\n1855.\r\n\r\n=Return.= An official account, report, or statement, rendered to the\r\ncommander or other superior; as, the return of men fit for duty; the\r\nreturn of the number of the sick; the return of provisions, etc. For\r\npunishment of officers making false returns, see APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF\r\nWAR, 8.\r\n\r\n=Returns of a Mine.= Are the turnings and windings of the gallery\r\nleading to the mine.\r\n\r\n=Returns of a Trench.= Are the various turnings and windings which form\r\nthe lines of the trench, and are, as near as they can be, made parallel\r\nto the place attacked, to avoid being enfiladed.\r\n\r\n=Reveille.= The beat of the drum about break of day, to give notice that\r\nit is time for the soldiers to rise, and for the sentinels to forbear\r\nchallenging.\r\n\r\n=Reveil-matin= (_Fr._). A double cannon; an ancient 96-pounder.\r\n\r\n=Revel=, or =Reval=. A strongly fortified seaport town of Russia,\r\ngovernment of Esthonia, on a small bay on the south side of the Gulf of\r\nFinland, 200 miles west-southwest from St. Petersburg. It was long held\r\nby the Teutonic Knights; was made over to Sweden in 1562; bombarded by\r\nthe Danish and Lübeck fleets in 1569; besieged by Peter the Great, and\r\nannexed to the Russian empire in 1710. In 1713 a naval harbor, in\r\naddition to the commercial harbor, was founded.\r\n\r\n=Reverse.= A change for the worse, or partial defeat.\r\n\r\n=Reverse Fire.= See FIRE, REVERSE.\r\n\r\n=Reverse Flank.= See FLANK, OUTWARD.\r\n\r\n=Reversed.= Upside down; as, arms reversed. Arms are said to be reversed\r\nwhen the butts of the pieces are slung, or held upwards.\r\n\r\n=Reversed.= In heraldry, a term applied to a charge turned upside down.\r\n\r\n=Revet.= In fortification, to face with masonry, wood, or material, as\r\nan embankment.\r\n\r\n=Revetment.= In permanent fortification, is a retaining wall of masonry\r\nbuilt for the purpose of holding back the earth of which works are\r\ncomposed. The most ordinary position of revetments is for the escarp and\r\ncounterscarp of the ditch. The most important of these two is the\r\nescarp, which has to hold back the great mass of earth represented by\r\nthe rampart, parapet, banquette, etc. It is usually of solid brick-work\r\nor stone, 5 feet thick at the top, and sloping outwards as it descends\r\n(on the ditch side only) to the extent of 1 in 6. Prior to Vauban’s\r\ntime, the escarp revetment was commonly raised to the top of the\r\nparapet; but as in this case the artillery of a besieger played on the\r\ntop of the wall, and ruined it soon after the siege commenced, that\r\nengineer adopted the principle--thenceforth followed--of raising it no\r\nhigher than the crest of the glacis, or about 7 feet above the natural\r\nground, leaving the parapet above of sloped earth only. When the main\r\nditch is 24 feet deep, the scarp revetment will be about 30 feet high.\r\nAdditional strength is imparted to the revetment wall by massive\r\nbuttresses at every 15 feet, called _counter-forts_, and these again are\r\nsometimes connected and strengthened by masonry arches outside the\r\nrevetment. The revetment forms a terrible barrier to an assaulting\r\nparty. In field-works temporary revetments may be made of timber, turf,\r\nhurdles, or any other materials on hand.\r\n\r\n=Review.= An examination or inspection of troops under arms, by a\r\ngeneral or commander, for the purpose of ascertaining the state of their\r\ndiscipline, equipments, etc.\r\n\r\n=Revision.= A re-examination for correction. Where an officer, who\r\norders a court-martial, does not approve their proceedings, he may, by\r\nthe custom of war, return them to the court for revision, and no\r\nadditional evidence can be taken on such revision.--_Hough._\r\n\r\n=Revocable.= That may be recalled. Nominations for appointments in the\r\narmy are made by the President of the United States, subject to the\r\nconcurrence of the Senate, who, if they disagree, revoke the\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\n=Revolt.= To renounce allegiance or subjection; to rise against the\r\ngovernment in declared rebellion.\r\n\r\n=Revolution.= In politics, any extensive change in the constitution of a\r\ncountry suddenly brought about. The most important events in history\r\nknown under this name are: The destruction of the Assyrian empire, and\r\nthe foundation of that of the Medes and Persians by Cyrus the Great, 536\r\nB.C.; the foundation of the Macedonian empire on the destruction of the\r\nPersian, by the defeat of Darius Codomanus, by Alexander the Great, 331\r\nB.C.; the establishment of the Roman empire on the ruins of the republic\r\nby Julius Cæsar, 47 B.C.; the establishment of the empire of the Western\r\nFranks under Charlemagne, 800; the revolution in Portugal, by which the\r\nPortuguese threw off the Spanish yoke and placed John, duke of Braganza,\r\non the throne, 1640; the English revolution of the 17th century, which\r\nbegan in the early part of the reign of Charles I., with the struggle\r\nbetween that king and his Parliament. In 1642, the struggle became a\r\ncivil war, in which the Parliament obtained the ascendency, and brought\r\nCharles to the block in 1649. A republic followed, under the\r\nprotectorate of Oliver Cromwell, which was succeeded in 1660 by the\r\nrestoration of monarchy in the person of Charles II.; but the arbitrary\r\nrule of James II. brought the king and people again into antagonism, and\r\nJames having fled the country, William III. was called to the throne\r\nunder such conditions and safeguards as secured the balance of the\r\nconstitution. The revolutions in Russia, 1730 and 1762. The French\r\nrevolution was a violent reaction against that absolutism which had come\r\nin the course of time to supplant the old feudal institutions of the\r\ncountry. It began with an outbreak of insurrectionary movements at Paris\r\nin July, 1789, including the destruction of the Bastile. On January 21,\r\n1793, King Louis XVI. was beheaded. A disastrous reign of terror\r\nfollowed (see REIGN OF TERROR), which was brought to an end in 1794. The\r\nrevolution in Sweden, 1772 and 1809; in Holland, 1795, and\r\ncounter-revolution in 1813; in Poland, 1704, 1795, and 1830. The\r\nAmerican Revolution of 1775, by which the United States threw off their\r\ndependence on Great Britain. The French revolution of 1830, which drove\r\nCharles X. into exile, and raised Louis Philippe, duke of Orleans, to\r\nthe throne by the will of the people; as also the revolution of 1848,\r\nwhen France rose against Louis Philippe and adopted for a time a\r\nrepublican form of government; which was followed by the revolution of\r\n1851. The revolutions in the Netherlands, and in Brunswick, 1830; in\r\nBrazil, 1831; in Hungary, 1848; in Rome, 1798 and 1848; in Italy,\r\n1859-60, when the various minor sovereigns were driven into exile, and\r\nthe whole of the peninsula, with the exception of the Roman and Venetian\r\nterritory, became subject to the constitutional sway of Victor Emmanuel;\r\nin the United States, 1860-65; in the Danubian principalities, 1869; and\r\nthe Papal States, suppressed, October, 1867.\r\n\r\n=Revolutionary.= Tending or pertaining to a revolution in government;\r\nas, a revolutionary war.\r\n\r\n=Revolutionary Tribunal.= The name specially given to the infamous court\r\nof judgment--the most extreme republican will scarcely affirm that it\r\nwas a court of justice--instituted by the French Convention in March,\r\n1793, on a motion made by Danton, who considered that such a court had\r\nbecome necessary, inasmuch as the recent disasters that had befallen the\r\nnational armies on the frontiers had led to dangerous conspiracies\r\nagainst the revolutionary government. Its members were chosen from the\r\nvarious departments, and their appointment was ratified by the\r\nConvention. Their function was to sit in judgment on all persons accused\r\nof crimes against the state, and from their sentence, delivered with\r\nappalling promptitude, there was no appeal. During the “Reign of Terror”\r\n(which see), when Fouquier-Tinville was “public accuser,” it acquired a\r\nhorrible notoriety, abolishing soon almost all forms of justice, neither\r\nhearing witnesses on behalf of the accused, nor allowing him an\r\nopportunity of defense, but blindly executing the orders of the\r\n“Committee of Public Safety,” which was merely a tool in the hands of\r\nRobespierre. In the provinces, similar tribunals, under the name of\r\n“Revolutionary Committees,” were established, the commissaries-general\r\nof which, as, for instance, Carrier, shot or drowned _suspects_ in\r\ncrowds.\r\n\r\n=Revolvers.= See SMALL-ARMS, REVOLVER.\r\n\r\n=Revolving Light.= A light or lamp in a light-house so arranged as to\r\nappear and disappear at fixed intervals, either by being turned about an\r\naxis so as to show light only at intervals, or by having its light\r\noccasionally intercepted by a revolving screen.\r\n\r\n=Reward.= A recompense given for the performance of a meritorious or\r\ngallant act; as, the soldiers were rewarded with medals for their\r\ngallantry. In the U. S. service a reward of $30 is paid for the\r\napprehension of a deserter.\r\n\r\n=Rezonville.= See GRAVELOTTE.\r\n\r\n=Rhagæ= (ruins at _Rai_, southeast of _Tehran_). The greatest city of\r\nMedia, lay in the extreme north of Great Media, at the southern foot of\r\nthe mountains (Caspius Mons) which border the southern shores of the\r\nCaspian Sea. It was destroyed in the Parthian wars, but rebuilt by\r\nArsaces; it was finally destroyed by the Tartars in the 12th century.\r\n\r\n=Rhegium= (now _Reggio_). A celebrated Greek town on the coast of\r\nBruttium, on the south of Italy, was situated on the straits which\r\nseparate Italy and Sicily. Rhegium was founded about the beginning of\r\nthe first Messenian war, 743 B.C., by Æolian Chalcidians from Eubœa, and\r\nby Doric Messenians, who had quitted their native country on the\r\ncommencement of hostilities between Sparta and Messenia. Even before the\r\nPersian war Rhegium was sufficiently powerful to send 3000 of its\r\ncitizens to the assistance of the Tarentines. Dionysius carried on war\r\nagainst the city for a long time, and after two or three unsuccessful\r\nattempts he at length took the place, which he treated with the greatest\r\nseverity. The Rhegians having applied to Rome for assistance when\r\nPyrrhus was in the south of Italy, the Romans placed in the town a\r\ngarrison of 4000 soldiers, who had been levied among the Latin colonies\r\nin Campania. These troops seized the town in 279, killed or expelled the\r\nmale inhabitants, and took possession of their wives and children. When\r\nPyrrhus was driven out of Italy, the Romans took signal vengeance upon\r\nthese Campanians, and restored the surviving Rhegians to their city.\r\n\r\n=Rheims=, or =Reims=. A town of France, in the department of Marne, 82\r\nmiles east-northeast from Paris. The town was taken by the Russians in\r\n1814, but before they had been in possession many hours Napoleon came\r\ndown upon them, and gained here one of his last successes before victory\r\ndeserted his standards. Gen. MacMahon was at Rheims with his army,\r\nincluding the remains of the corps of Failly and Canrobert, and marched\r\nfrom here in hopes of joining Bazaine; the crown-prince of Prussia\r\nstarted in pursuit, August 23, 1870. It was occupied by the Germans and\r\nthe king, September 5, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Rhin, Bas= and =Haut= (Lower and Upper Rhine). Recently departments of\r\nFrance, which formed the former French province of Alsace. See ELSASS.\r\n\r\n=Rhine= (anc. _Rhenus_, Ger. _Rhein_). An important river in Germany,\r\nand one of the most noted in Europe, takes its rise in the Swiss canton\r\nof Grisons, and after a north-northwest course of about 800 miles, falls\r\nin the German Ocean. Cæsar was the first Roman general who crossed the\r\nRhine; he threw a bridge of boats across it. It was fortified as the\r\nfrontier of the Roman empire 298 and 369, and became the boundary of the\r\nFrench republic in 1776.\r\n\r\n=Rhode Island.= One of the original thirteen United States of America,\r\nand the smallest, on the southern coast of New England, is about 47\r\nmiles from north to south, and 37 miles from east to west. It is bounded\r\nnorth and east by Massachusetts, south by the Atlantic, and west by\r\nConnecticut. Rhode Island is believed to have been the Vineland of the\r\nNorsemen, who are supposed by some antiquarians to have explored this\r\ncoast in the 10th century. It was settled in 1636 by Roger Williams and\r\nhis companions, Baptists, who were expelled for their religious opinions\r\nfrom the Puritan colony of Plymouth. The colony suffered from the Indian\r\nwars until the defeat and death of Philip, king of the Wampanoags. Rhode\r\nIsland took a prominent part in the Revolutionary war, and in the late\r\ncivil war (1861-65) she filled her quotas cheerfully for the cause of\r\nthe Union, her soldiers winning distinction and honor in the field.\r\n\r\n=Rhodes= (Lat. _Rhodus_, Gr. _Rhodos_.). An island of Asiatic Turkey, in\r\nthe Mediterranean, off the southwest coast of Asia Minor, long an\r\nimportant, wealthy, and independent state of ancient Greece. At the\r\nbeginning of the Peloponnesian war, Rhodes was one of those maritime\r\nstates which were subject to Athens; but in the twentieth year of the\r\nwar (412), it joined the Spartan alliance, and the oligarchal party,\r\nwhich had been depressed, and their leaders, the Eratidæ, expelled,\r\nrecovered their former power under Dories. In 408 the capital, called\r\nRhodus, was built. The history of the island now presents a series of\r\nconflicts between the democratical and oligarchal parties, and of\r\nsubjection to Athens and Sparta in turn, till the end of the Social war,\r\n355, when its independence was acknowledged. Then followed a conflict\r\nwith the princes of Caria, during which the island was for a time\r\nsubject to Artemisia. At the Macedonian conquest, they submitted to\r\nAlexander; but upon his death they expelled the Macedonian garrison. In\r\nthe ensuing wars they formed an alliance with Ptolemy, the son of Lagus,\r\nand their city, Rhodus, endured a most famous siege by the forces of\r\nDemetrius Poliorcetes, who at length, in admiration of the valor of the\r\nbesieged, presented them with the engines he had used against the city,\r\nfrom the sale of which they defrayed the cost of the celebrated\r\nColossus. The state now for a long time flourished with great maritime\r\npower. At length they came into connection with the Romans, whose\r\nalliance they joined in the war against Philip III. of Macedon. In the\r\nensuing war with Antiochus, the Rhodians gave the Romans great aid with\r\ntheir fleet. A temporary interruption of their alliance with Rome was\r\ncaused by their espousing the cause of Perseus, for which they were\r\nseverely punished, 168; but they recovered the favor of Rome by the\r\nimportant naval aid they rendered in the Mithridatic war. In the civil\r\nwars they took part with Cæsar, and suffered in consequence from\r\nCassius, 42. They were at length deprived of their independence by\r\nClaudius. In 1309 the island came into the possession of the Knights of\r\nSt. John (see SAINT JOHN OF JERUSALEM), who baffled every effort made by\r\nMahomet II., the conqueror of Constantinople, to drive them from the\r\nisland, and held it until they were compelled to evacuate it by Solyman\r\nthe Great in 1522, after one of the most memorable sieges recorded in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n=Rhoxolani=, or =Roxolani=. A warlike people in European Sarmatia, on\r\nthe coast of the Palus Mæotis, and between the Borysthenes and the\r\nTanais, usually supposed to be the ancestors of the modern Russians.\r\nThey frequently attacked and plundered the Roman provinces south of the\r\nDanube; and Hadrian was even obliged to pay them tribute. They are\r\nmentioned as late as the 11th century. They fought with lances, and with\r\nlong swords wielded with both hands; and their armies were composed\r\nchiefly of cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Ribadoquin.= An ancient 1- or 1³⁄₄-pounder gun. Also, a powerful\r\ncross-bow for throwing long darts.\r\n\r\n=Ribaud= (_Fr._). A soldier of the foot-guards of Philip Augustus of\r\nFrance; but afterwards this term was applied only to the most infamous\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n=Ribaudaille= (_Fr._). A term of reproach formerly applied to cowardly\r\nsoldiers. Philip of Valois thus called his Genoese mercenaries, who he\r\nthought had betrayed him.\r\n\r\n=Ribaudequin= (_Fr._). A warlike machine or instrument which the French\r\nformerly used. It was made in the form of a bow, containing 12 or 15\r\nfeet in its curve, and was fixed upon the wall of a fortified town, for\r\nthe purpose of casting out a prodigious javelin, which sometimes killed\r\nseveral men at once. According to Monstrelet, a French writer,\r\n_ribaudequin_, or _ribauderin_, signified a sort of garment which was\r\nworn by the soldiers when they took the field.\r\n\r\n=Ribbon.= In heraldry, a diminutive of the ordinary called the _bend_,\r\nof which it is one-eighth in width.\r\n\r\n=Ribbon Cockades.= In the British service, the cockades which are given\r\nto recruits, and are commonly called the _colors_.\r\n\r\n=Richmond.= The capital of Virginia, on the left bank of the James\r\nRiver, at the head of the tide-water, 150 miles from its mouth, and 100\r\nmiles south of Washington. In June, 1861, it was selected as the\r\nConfederate capital, and from that period was the objective-point of a\r\nseries of formidable military expeditions for its capture, under Gens.\r\nMcDowell, McClellan, Burnside, Hooker, Meade, and Grant, and defended by\r\nGen. Lee with a large army and formidable lines of fortifications, until\r\nthe seizure of the lines of supply by Gens. Grant and Sheridan compelled\r\nits evacuation after a series of sanguinary battles, April 3, 1865. A\r\nconsiderable portion of the city was destroyed by the retreating\r\nConfederates.\r\n\r\n=Rickarees=, =Arickarees=, or =Rees=. A tribe of Indians of the Pawnee\r\nstock living at Fort Berthold agency, on the Upper Missouri River; they\r\nwarred with the Dakota tribes for a number of years, and were hostile to\r\nthe whites; but were defeated and dispersed by U. S. troops in 1823;\r\nmade a treaty in 1825; were driven up the Platte Valley, 1831; returned\r\nto the Missouri some years later. They numbered in 1876 about 700 souls.\r\n\r\n=Ricochet.= In gunnery, the repeated rebounding of round-shot. By firing\r\nat a slight elevation, with small charges, in a direction enfilading the\r\nface of a work, shot are pitched over the parapet, and bound along the\r\nrampart from end to end, with most destructive effect on the guns and\r\ngunners occupying it.\r\n\r\n=Ricochet Battery.= See BATTERY.\r\n\r\n=Ricochet Firing.= See FIRE, RICOCHET.\r\n\r\n=Rideau.= Is a rising ground, or eminence, commanding a plain, sometimes\r\nalmost parallel to the works of a place. It is a great disadvantage to\r\nhave rideaus near a fortification, which terminate on the counterscarp,\r\nespecially when the enemy fire from afar; they not only command the\r\nplace, but facilitate the enemy’s approaches.\r\n\r\n=Rider.= In artillery carriages, a piece of wood, which has more height\r\nthan breadth; the length being equal to that of the body of the\r\naxle-tree, upon which the side-pieces rest in a four-wheel carriage,\r\nsuch as the ammunition-wagon, block-carriage, and sling-wagon.\r\n\r\n=Ridge.= In fortification, is the highest part of the glacis proceeding\r\nfrom the salient angle of the covered way.\r\n\r\n=Riding-Master.= In the British service, in cavalry, artillery, and the\r\narmy service corps, is an officer whose duty it is to instruct the\r\nofficers and men in the management of their horses. He is most commonly\r\nselected from the ranks. The riding-master has the relative rank of\r\nlieutenant, and, after an aggregate service of thirty years, including\r\nat least fifteen years as riding-master, he has the right to retire on\r\n10 shillings a day, with the honorary rank of captain. He is assisted in\r\nhis duties by rough riders. (See ROUGH RIDER.)\r\n\r\n=Riff, The.= A portion of the coast of Morocco which extends from\r\nTangier on the west, to near the western frontier of Algeria. The name\r\nin the Berber language, which is that of the inhabitants, signifies a\r\nmountainous and rugged coast. The inhabitants of the Riff were formerly\r\nengaged in piracy. On account of the injuries inflicted by them on\r\nmerchant vessels, most of the maritime states of Europe agreed to pay an\r\nannual sum of quit-money. However, in 1828, Austria declined further\r\npayment of the tax. A Venetian vessel was seized by the pirates in the\r\nharbor of Rabat, but the arrival of an Austrian fleet off the port\r\nproduced restitution of the ship and its cargo, as well as the formal\r\nrenunciation of all further claims. France followed the same course by\r\ndeclaring war against the sultan of Morocco, and obtained compensation\r\nin 1844, since which period piracy has much diminished. Its example was\r\nfollowed by the Spaniards in 1859.\r\n\r\n=Rifle.= A fire-arm having a number of spiral grooves cut into the\r\nsurface of its bore, for the purpose of giving the projectile a motion\r\nabout a line coinciding with the direction of its flight. See ORDNANCE,\r\nSMALL-ARMS, MAGAZINE GUNS, and LYMAN’S MULTI-CHARGE GUN.\r\n\r\n=Rifle Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Rifled Cannon=, or =Rifle-cannon=. A cannon of which the bore is\r\nrifled.\r\n\r\n=Rifled Musket.= A musket of which the bore is rifled.\r\n\r\n=Riflemen.= A peculiar kind of light infantry, consisting of experienced\r\nmarksmen, armed with the most improved rifles. In the British army there\r\nare two battalions of the rifle brigade and of the 60th Rifles, the\r\nCeylon Rifles, and the Cape Mounted Riflemen.\r\n\r\n=Rifle-pit.= A pit dug for the shelter of sharpshooters.\r\n\r\n=Rifling.= The yielding nature of lead renders the application of the\r\nrifle principle of easy accomplishment in the case of rifle-muskets, but\r\nsuch is not the case with rifle-cannon where the projectiles are made of\r\niron. The object of the most recent experiments is to determine the\r\nsafest and surest means of causing the projectile to follow the spiral\r\ngrooves as it passes along the bore of a rifled piece. For description\r\nof the manner of doing this, see PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n_Form of Groove._--The form of a rifle groove is determined by the angle\r\nwhich the tangent at any point makes with the corresponding element of\r\nthe bore. If the angles be equal at all points the groove is uniform.\r\nIf they increase from the breech to the muzzle, the grooves are called\r\nincreasing; if the reverse, decreasing. The inclination of a rifle\r\ngroove at any point is measured, accurately, by the tangent of the angle\r\nwhich it makes with the axis of the bore, which is always equal to the\r\ncircumference of the bore divided by the length of a single revolution\r\nof the spiral, measured in the direction of the axis. Grooves are of two\r\nkinds,--_uniform_ and _variable_.\r\n\r\n_Uniform Groove._--The comparative advantages of uniform and variable\r\ngrooves depend on the means used to connect them with the projectiles.\r\nIf the bearing of the projectile in the grooves be long, and the metal\r\nof which it is made be unyielding, it will be unsafe, if not\r\nimpracticable, to employ variable grooves, and if the metal be partially\r\nyielding, a portion of the force of the charge will be expended in\r\nchanging the form of that part of the projectile which projects into the\r\ngrooves, as it moves along the bore.\r\n\r\n_Variable Groove._--The variable groove may be used to advantage when\r\nthe portion of the projectile in the grooves is so short that its form\r\nwill undergo but slight alteration; the variable groove diminishes the\r\nfriction of the projectile when it is first set in motion, and thereby\r\nrelieves the breech of the piece of a portion of the enormous strain\r\nwhich is thrown upon it. If the twist be too rapid towards the muzzle\r\nthere will be danger of bursting the piece in the chase.\r\n\r\n_Width of Groove._--The width of a groove depends on the diameter of the\r\nbore and the peculiar manner in which the groove receives and holds the\r\nprojectile. Wide and shallow grooves are more easily filled by the\r\nexpanding portion of the projectile than those which are narrow and\r\ndeep; and the same holds true of circular-shaped grooves when compared\r\nto those of angular form.\r\n\r\n_Number of Grooves._--An increase in the number of grooves increases the\r\nfirmness with which a projectile is held, by adding to the number of\r\npoints which bear upon it. A large number of grooves, however, increase\r\nthe difficulties of loading. For expanding projectiles an odd number of\r\ngrooves is generally employed, for as this places a groove opposite to a\r\nland, less expansion will be required to fill them.\r\n\r\n_Inclination of Grooves._--Experience has shown that, as the velocity of\r\nrotation depends upon the form and initial velocity of the projectile,\r\nthe causes which retard it, and the time of flight, there is a\r\nparticular inclination of grooves which is best suited to each caliber,\r\nform of projectile, charge of powder, and angle of fire. The farther the\r\ncentre of gravity of a projectile is in rear of the centre of figure, or\r\nresistance of the air, the greater must be the inclination of the\r\ngrooves to resist deviation. It therefore follows that a conical\r\nprojectile of the same length and diameter, requires a greater\r\ninclination of grooves than a cylindrical projectile, and the same will\r\nhold true for other forms as they approach one or the other of these\r\nextreme cases. The friction of the projectile as it passes along the\r\ngrooves, increases with their inclination; its effect will be to\r\ndiminish the range and increase the strain on the piece, and the\r\ninclination may be carried so far as to break the projectile, or rupture\r\nthe piece.\r\n\r\n_Centring._--In consequence of the windage necessary in all\r\nmuzzle-loading guns, the axis of the projectile does not always coincide\r\nwith that of the bore in firing. This leads to inaccuracy of fire. A\r\nprojectile is said to be centred when the grooves of the rifling are so\r\nconstructed as to bring the axis of the projectile on a line with that\r\nof the bore when the piece is fired. There are several ways of\r\naccomplishing this, among them Armstrong’s method called “Shunt\r\nrifling.” See ARMSTRONG GUN under ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF, the KRUPP,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n=Riga.= An important seaport of Russia, capital of Livonia, on the Düna,\r\n312 miles southwest from St. Petersburg. Riga was founded in the\r\nbeginning of the 13th century. The Teutonic Knights possessed it in the\r\n16th century. In 1621 it was taken by Gustavus Adolphus, and in 1710,\r\nafter a vigorous resistance, by Peter the Great. On the latter occasion\r\nmore than half of the town was destroyed. In 1812 a French force was\r\nrepulsed from the town.\r\n\r\n=Rigodon= (_Fr._). Formerly a beat of drum while men who were shelled (a\r\nFrench punishment, the severest next to death) were paraded up and down\r\nthe ranks previous to their being sent to their destination.\r\n\r\n=Rimbases.= In gunnery, are short cylinders uniting the trunnions with\r\nthe body of the gun. The ends of the rimbases, or the _shoulders_ of the\r\ntrunnions, are planes perpendicular to the axis of the trunnions.\r\nRimbases are for the purpose of strengthening the trunnions at their\r\njunction with the piece, and by forming shoulders, to prevent the piece\r\nfrom moving sideways in the trunnion-beds.\r\n\r\n=Rimer.= A palisade in fortification.\r\n\r\n=Rimini= (anc. _Ariminum_). A city of Central Italy, on the Adriatic\r\nSea, about 28 miles east-southeast from Forli. It was founded by the\r\nUmbri; was conquered by the Romans; sacked by Sulla; plundered and\r\ndestroyed several times by the barbarians; then given by Charlemagne to\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\n=Rimnik.= A town of Wallachia, on the Rimnik, 66 miles northeast from\r\nBucharest. Here the Austrians and Russians, under Prince Coburg and Gen.\r\nSuwarrow, gained a great victory over the Turks, September 22, 1789.\r\n\r\n=Ring-armor.= Armor composed of rings of metal.\r\n\r\n=Ringleader.= The leader of a ring; especially, the leader of an\r\nassociation of men engaged in violation of law or an illegal enterprise,\r\nas rioters, mutineers, and the like.\r\n\r\n=Ring-mail.= A kind of mail composed of small rings of steel sewed\r\nedgewise upon a strong garment of leather or of quilted cloth.\r\n\r\n=Ring-wads.= See GROMMET.\r\n\r\n=Rio Janeiro=, or =Rio de Janeiro=, often called simply Rio. The capital\r\nof Brazil, and the largest and most important city of South America. The\r\nharbor, which is strongly fortified, is one of the best in the world,\r\nand large enough for all its navies. The city of Rio was founded by the\r\nPortuguese in 1567. In 1831, it was the theatre of a revolution, in\r\nwhich 6000 armed citizens were joined by the troops of the line in their\r\nopposition to the government, and in consequence of which Dom Pedro\r\nabdicated the throne in favor of his son Pedro II.\r\n\r\n=Riot and Tumult.= Sedition, civil insurrection, disturbance, etc. A\r\nbreach of the peace committed by an assembled multitude. Some degree of\r\nviolence is incidental to a riot, and a degree of intimidation to the\r\nneighborhood. According to law a riot cannot take place unless three\r\npersons act in concert. When a riot becomes formidable, it is usual for\r\nthe authorities to take active measures to disperse it.\r\n\r\n=Rioters.= Disturbers of the public peace; persons acting in open\r\nviolation of good order; raising or creating sedition, etc.\r\n\r\n=Ripon.= An ancient town of England, in Yorkshire, 23 miles northwest of\r\nYork. It suffered much by the ravages of the Danes and the Normans\r\n(1069), and the Scots (1319 and 1323).\r\n\r\n=Risban= (_Fr._). In fortification, a flat piece of ground upon which a\r\nfort is constructed for the defense and security of a port or harbor. It\r\nlikewise means the fort itself.\r\n\r\n=Risberme= (_Fr._). A work composed of fascines, such as is sometimes\r\nconstructed at the bottom of a town-wall. A sort of glacis of\r\nfascine-work used in jetties, the sides of which, towards the sea, are\r\nso formed as to withstand its violence.\r\n\r\n=Rise.= In a military sense, is to make hostile attack; as, the soldiers\r\nrose against their officers. It also means to obtain promotion. _To rise\r\nfrom the ranks_, is to obtain a commission by degrees, after having been\r\nin the ranks as a private soldier.\r\n\r\n=Rising.= In heraldry, a term applied to a bird when represented opening\r\nhis wings as if about to take flight.\r\n\r\n=Riveting-plates.= In gun-carriages, are small, square, thin pieces of\r\niron, through which the ends of the bolts pass, and are riveted upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n=Rivoli.= A town of Italy on the right of the river Dora, and 8 miles\r\nwest of Turin. It possesses a royal castle, which was sacked by the\r\nFrench in 1690. In 1797 a battle was fought here between the French and\r\nAustrians, in which the former were victorious.\r\n\r\n=Rizamedar.= In the East Indies, is an officer commanding a small body\r\nof horse.\r\n\r\n=Roanoke.= A river of Virginia and North Carolina; empties into\r\nAlbemarle Sound. In 1861, Albemarle Island, at its mouth, and Plymouth\r\nwere taken by the Federal gunboats.\r\n\r\n=Robinet.= An ancient military machine for throwing darts and stones.\r\n\r\n=Rochelle, La.= A fortified seaport of France, capital of the department\r\nof Charente-Inférieure, on an inlet of the Bay of Biscay, 300 miles\r\nsouthwest of Paris by railway. It was taken from the English by the\r\ntroops of the French king Louis XIII. in 1224; was ceded to England at\r\nthe treaty of Bretigny in 1360; in the subsequent wars it was retaken by\r\nFrance, under whose sway it has remained since 1372. As a stronghold of\r\nthe Huguenot party, it underwent various attacks and sieges during the\r\nreligious wars of the Henries, in the latter half of the 16th century;\r\nand on its final and unconditional surrender to the royal troops in the\r\ntime of Louis XIII., its old fortifications were destroyed, and new\r\nlines of defenses subsequently erected by the great Vauban.\r\n\r\n=Rock Island.= An island in the Mississippi River, the southern\r\nextremity of which is nearly opposite the town of Rock Island, Ill. This\r\nisland is about 3 miles in length, and presents a perpendicular front of\r\nlimestone 20 or 30 feet high. During the Blackhawk war a garrison was\r\nkept on Rock Island, and a part of it was used during the late civil war\r\n(1861-65) as a military prison. The U. S. government has a splendid\r\narsenal and armory here.\r\n\r\n=Rocket.= A rocket is a projectile which is set in motion by a force\r\nresiding within itself; it therefore performs the twofold function of\r\npiece and projectile. See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n_History._--Rockets were used in India and China for war purposes before\r\nthe discovery of gunpowder; some writers fix the date of their invention\r\nabout the close of the 9th century. Their inferior force and accuracy\r\nlimited the sphere of their operations to incendiary purposes, until the\r\nyear 1804, when Sir William Congreve turned his attention to their\r\nimprovement. This officer substituted sheet-iron cases for those made of\r\npaper, which enabled him to use a more powerful composition; he made the\r\nguide-stick shorter and lighter, and removed a source of inaccuracy of\r\nflight by attaching the stick to the centre of the base instead of the\r\nside of the case. The advantages claimed for rockets over cannon are,\r\nunlimited size of projectile, portability, freedom from recoil, rapidity\r\nof discharge, and the terror which their noise and fiery trail produce\r\non mounted troops.\r\n\r\n_Structure._--A rocket is essentially composed of a strong case of paper\r\nor wrought iron, inclosing a composition of nitre, charcoal, and\r\nsulphur,--the same as gunpowder, except that the ingredients are\r\nproportioned for a slower rate of combustion. If penetration and range\r\nbe required, its head is surmounted by a solid shot; if explosion and\r\nincendiary effect, by a shell or spherical case-shot, to which is\r\nattached a fuze, which is set on fire when it is reached by the flame\r\nof the burning composition. The base is perforated by one or more vents\r\nfor the escape of the gas generated within, and sometimes with a\r\nscrew-hole to which a guide-stick is fastened.\r\n\r\n_Motion._--A rocket is set in motion by the reaction of a rapid stream\r\nof gas escaping through its vents. If it be surrounded by a resisting\r\nmedium, the atmosphere, for instance, the particles of gas as they issue\r\nfrom the vent will impinge against and set in motion certain particles\r\nof air, and the force expended on the inertia of these particles will\r\nreact and increase the propelling force of the rocket. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that, though a rocket will move _in vacuo_, its propelling\r\nforce will be increased by the presence of a resisting medium. Whether\r\nthe effect will be to accelerate the rocket depends upon the relation\r\nbetween the resistance which the medium offers to the motion of the gas\r\nand that which it offers to the motion of the rocket.\r\n\r\n_Vent._--As the rate of combustion of the composition is independent of\r\nthe pressure of the gas in the bore, it follows, that if the size of the\r\nvent be contracted, the flow of gas through it will be accelerated. The\r\nstrength of the case, and the friction of the gas, which increases as\r\nthe vent diminishes, alone limit the reduction of the size of the vent.\r\nFor vents of the same size, but of different shapes, that one which\r\nallows the gas to escape most freely will be most favorable to the\r\nflight of the rocket. A conical form of vent, with the larger orifice\r\nnext to the bore, will allow the gas to escape more rapidly than one of\r\ncylindrical form.\r\n\r\n_Bore._--As the composition of a rocket burns in parallel layers of\r\nuniform thickness, the amount of gas generated in a given time, or the\r\nvelocity of its exit from the case, depends on the extent of the\r\ninflamed surface. Experience shows that to obtain the required surface\r\nof inflammation, it is necessary to form a long cavity in the mass of\r\nthe composition. This cavity is called the bore. In all rockets the bore\r\nshould be concentric with the case; its shape should be made conical to\r\ndiminish the strain on the case near its head, by reducing the amount of\r\nsurface where the pressure on the unit of surface is greatest.\r\n\r\n_Nature of Movement._--Suppose the rocket in a state of rest, and the\r\ncomposition ignited; the flame immediately spreads over the surface of\r\nthe bore, forming gas which issues from the vent. The escape is slow in\r\nthe first moments, as the density of the gas is slight; but as the\r\nsurface of inflammation is large compared to the size of the vent, the\r\ngas accumulates rapidly, and its density is increased until the velocity\r\nof the escape is sufficient to overcome the resistance which the rocket\r\noffers to motion. These resistances are, inertia, friction, the\r\ncomponent of weight in the direction of motion, and, after motion takes\r\nplace, the resistance of the air. The constant pressure on the head of\r\nthe bore accelerates the motion of the rocket until the resistance of\r\nthe air equals the propelling force; after this, it will remain constant\r\nuntil the burning surface is sensibly diminished. When the gas ceases to\r\nflow, the rocket loses its distinctive character, and becomes, so far as\r\nits movement is concerned, an ordinary projectile. The increase in the\r\nsurface of combustion whereby more gas is developed in the same time,\r\nand the diminution in the weight of the remaining composition, cause the\r\npoint of maximum velocity to be reached with increased rapidity. If the\r\nweight of the rocket be increased, the instant of maximum velocity will\r\nbe prolonged, but the amount will remain the same. A change in the form\r\nof the rocket which increases the resistance of the air, will have the\r\neffect to diminish the maximum velocity.\r\n\r\n_Guiding Principle._--The propelling force of a rocket changes its\r\ndirection with the axis along which it acts; it follows, therefore, that\r\nwithout some means of giving stability to this axis, the path described\r\nwill be very irregular, so much so, at times, as to fold upon itself;\r\nand instances have been known where these projectiles have returned to\r\nthe point whence they started. The two means now used to give steadiness\r\nto the flight of a rocket are, rotation, as in the case of a rifle-ball,\r\nand the resistance of the air, as in an arrow.\r\n\r\n_Hale’s System._--The first is exemplified in Hale’s rocket, where\r\nrotation is produced around the long axis by the escape of the gas\r\nthrough five small vents situated obliquely to it. In his first\r\narrangement, the inventor placed the small vents in the base,\r\nsurrounding the central vent, so that the resultant of the tangential\r\nforces acted around the posterior extremity of the axis of rotation. In\r\n1855, this arrangement was changed by reducing the number of the small\r\nvents to three, and placing them at the base of the head of the rocket.\r\nThe rocket thus modified is the one now used by the U. S. government for\r\nwar purposes. A still later improvement in Hale’s rocket consists in\r\nscrewing a cast-iron piece into the bottom of the case, which is\r\nperforated with three vents. A corresponding side of each vent is\r\nsurrounded with a fence, the opposite sides being open. The gas in its\r\nefforts to expand after issuing from the vents, presses against the\r\nfences and rotates the rocket around its long axis.\r\n\r\n_Congreve’s System._--A Congreve rocket is guided by a long wooden stick\r\nattached to its base. If any cause act to turn it from its proper\r\ndirection, it will be opposed by resistances equal to its moment of\r\ninertia and the lateral action of the air against the stick. The effect\r\nof these resistances will be increased by placing the centre of gravity\r\nnear the head of the rocket, and by increasing the surface of the stick.\r\nIn signal-rockets, where the case is made of paper, the stick is\r\nattached to the side, and there is but one large vent, which is in the\r\ncentre of the case. In war-rockets the stick is attached to the centre\r\nof the base, and the large central vent is replaced by several small\r\nones near its circumference. The former arrangement is not so favorable\r\nto accuracy as the latter, inasmuch as rotation will be produced if the\r\nforce of propulsion and the resistance of the air do not act in the same\r\nline.\r\n\r\n_How Fired._--Rockets are generally fired from tubes or gutters; but\r\nshould occasion require it, they may be fired directly from the ground,\r\ncare being taken to raise the forward end by propping it up with a stick\r\nor stone. As the motion is slow in the first moments of its flight, it\r\nis more liable to be deviated from its proper direction at this time\r\nthan any other; for this reason the conducting-tube should be as long as\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n_Form of Trajectory._--Take that portion of the trajectory where the\r\nvelocity is uniform. The weight of the rocket applied at its centre of\r\ngravity, and acting in a vertical direction, and the propelling force\r\nacting in the direction of its length, are two forces the oblique\r\nresultant of which moves the rocket parallel to itself; but the\r\nresistance of the air is oblique to this direction, and acting at the\r\ncentre of figure, a point situated between the centre of gravity and\r\nextremity of the guide-stick, produces a rotation which raises the\r\nstick, and thereby changes the direction in which the gas acts. As these\r\nforces are constantly acting, it follows that each element of the\r\ntrajectory has less inclination to the horizon than the element of an\r\nordinary trajectory in which the velocity is equal. When the velocity is\r\nnot _uniform_, the position of the centre of gravity has a certain\r\ninfluence on the form of the trajectory. To understand this, it is\r\nnecessary to consider that the component of the resistance of the air\r\nwhich acts on the head of the rocket is greater than that which acts on\r\nthe side of the stick. It is also necessary to consider that the\r\npressure of the inflamed gas acts in a direction opposite to the\r\nresistance of the air, that is to say, from the rear to the front, and\r\nthat the centre of gravity is near the rear extremity of the case. At\r\nthe beginning of the trajectory, when the motion of the rocket is\r\naccelerated, its inertia is opposed to motion, and being applied at the\r\ncentre of gravity, which is in rear of the vent, the point of\r\napplication of the moving force, it acts to prevent the rocket from\r\nturning over in its flight. But when the composition is consumed, the\r\ncentre of gravity is thrown farther to the rear, and the velocity of the\r\nrocket is retarded, the inertia acts in the opposite direction, and the\r\neffect will be, if the centre of gravity or inertia is sufficiently far\r\nto the rear, to cause it to turn over in the direction of its length. If\r\nthe rocket be directed toward the earth, this turning over will be\r\ncounteracted by the acceleration of velocity due to the weight, and the\r\nform of the trajectory will be preserved.\r\n\r\n_Effect of Wind._--When the wind acts obliquely to the plane of fire,\r\nits component perpendicular to this flame acting at the centre of figure\r\nwill cause the rocket to rotate around its centre of gravity. As the\r\ncentre of figure is situated in rear of the centre of gravity, the point\r\nwill be thrown toward the wind, and the propelling force acting always\r\nin the direction of the axis, the rocket will be urged toward the\r\ndirection of the wind. To make an allowance for the wind in firing\r\nrockets, they should be pointed toward the opposite side from which the\r\nwind comes, or with the wind instead of against it. If the wind act in\r\nthe plane of fire from front to rear, it will have the effect to depress\r\nthe point, and with it the elements of the trajectory in the ascending\r\nbranch, and elevate them in the descending branch; as the latter is\r\nshorter than the former, the effect of a front wind will be to diminish\r\nthe range. The converse will be true for a rear wind.\r\n\r\n_Kind Used._--The two sizes of Hale’s rockets in use in the American\r\nservice are, the 2-inch (interior diameter of case), weighing 6 pounds,\r\nand 3-inch (interior diameter of case), weighing 16 pounds. Under an\r\nangle of from 4° to 5° the range of these rockets is from 500 to 600\r\nyards. Under an angle of 47° the range of the former is 1760 yards, and\r\nthe latter 2200.\r\n\r\n=Rocroy=, or =Rocroi=. A small town of France, in the department of\r\nArdennes, 15 miles northwest from Mézières. It is memorable for the\r\nvictory gained by the great Condé (then duke of Enghien) over the\r\nSpaniards, May 19, 1643. The Spanish army was composed of veteran bands\r\nof Walloons, Spaniards, and Italians, and their general, Don Francisco\r\nde Mellos, was a commander worthy of his army. The French (22,000) were\r\nalso good troops, but their general, Condé, was a young and\r\ninexperienced officer. At first the battle was unfavorable to the\r\nFrench, but at last the Spaniards were thrown into irretrievable rout.\r\nThe Count of Fuentes, the commander of the redoubtable infantry, and\r\n10,000 of his men were among the slain; and 5000 men, with all the\r\ncannon, many standards, and the baton of the Count de Mellos, were\r\ncaptured. But, far beyond all material losses, the renown of\r\ninvincibility, first acquired by the Spanish infantry on the field of\r\nPavia (1525), and confirmed at St. Quentin, Gravelines, and Prague, was\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n=Rodman Gun.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Roermond.= An old town in the Netherlands, province of Limburg, at the\r\njunction of the Roer and Maas. It has often endured the horrors of being\r\nbesieged and taken.\r\n\r\n=Rogue River Indians.= See INDIANS AND THEIR AGENCIES (Oregon).\r\n\r\n=Rogue’s March.= Derisive music performed in driving away a person\r\nunder popular indignation, or when a soldier is drummed out of a\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n=Rohilcund.= A region of Northeast India; was conquered by the Rohillas,\r\nan Afghan tribe, who settled here about 1747. After aiding the sovereign\r\nof Oude to overcome the Mahrattas, they were treated with much treachery\r\nby him, and nearly exterminated. Rohilcund was ceded to the British in\r\n1801. After the great mutiny Rohilcund was tranquillized in July, 1858.\r\n\r\n=Rohillas.= An East Indian tribe of Afghans inhabiting the country north\r\nof the Ganges, as far to the north as Oude.\r\n\r\n=Roi d’Armes= (_Fr._). King-at-arms, an officer formerly of great\r\nauthority in armies; he directed the heralds, presided at their\r\nchapters, and had the jurisdiction of armories.\r\n\r\n=Roleia=, or =Rolica=. A village in Portugal, where on August 17, 1808,\r\na British force under Sir Arthur Wellesley defeated a French army under\r\nGen. Laborde.\r\n\r\n=Roll.= A term of varied signification in reference to military matters.\r\nThus, to _roll_ is to continue one uniform beat of the drum, without\r\nvariations for a certain length of time.\r\n\r\n=Roll, Long.= A prolonged roll of the drums, as a signal of an attack by\r\nthe enemy, and for the troops to arrange themselves in line.\r\n\r\n=Roll, Muster-.= See MUSTER-ROLL.\r\n\r\n=Roll of Arms.= A heraldic record of arms, either verbally blazoned or\r\nilluminated, or both, on a long strip of vellum, rolled up, instead of\r\nbeing folded into leaves.\r\n\r\n_Rolls of Arms_ are the most important and most authentic materials for\r\nthe history of early heraldry. In England they go back to the reign of\r\nHenry III., the oldest being a copy of a roll of that reign, containing\r\na list of the arms borne by the sovereign, the princes of the blood, and\r\nthe principal barons and knights between 1216 and 1272, verbally\r\nblazoned without drawings.\r\n\r\n=Roll, Squad.= Is a list containing the names of each particular squad\r\nin a company, etc.\r\n\r\n=Roll, Size.= In the British service, is a list containing the names of\r\nall the men belonging to a troop or company, with the height or stature\r\nof each specifically marked.\r\n\r\n=Roll-call.= The act or time of calling over a list of names; as, tattoo\r\nroll-call. _To call the roll_, to call off or recite a list or roll of\r\nnames of soldiers belonging to a company or troop, in order to\r\nascertain, from the responses, who are present and who are absent.\r\n\r\n=Rollers, Friction.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, SEA-COAST CARRIAGES.\r\n\r\n=Rolling Barrels.= See CAKING.\r\n\r\n=Rolling Fire.= A discharge of musketry by soldiers in line, in quick\r\nsuccession, and in the order in which they stand.

It was conquered by the Lombards; but taken from them\r\nby Pepin, and given to the pope, 753. Cæsar Borgia held it as a duchy in\r\n1501, but lost it in 1503. In 1859 the Romagna threw off the temporal\r\nauthority of the pope, and declared itself subject to the king of\r\nSardinia, who accepted it in March, 1860. It now forms part of the\r\nkingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Romainville and Belleville=. Heights near Paris, where Joseph\r\nBonaparte, Mortier, and Marmont were defeated by the allies after a\r\nvigorous resistance, March 30, 1814. The next day Paris capitulated.\r\n\r\n=Roman Candles.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Roman Walls.= One was erected by Agricola (79 to 85) to defend Britain\r\nfrom the incursions of the Picts and Scots; the first wall extended from\r\nthe Tyne to the Solway Frith (80 miles); the second from the Frith of\r\nForth, near Edinburgh, to the Frith of Clyde, near Dumbarton (36 miles).\r\nThe former was renewed and strengthened by the emperor Adrian (121) and\r\nby Septimus Severus (208). It commenced at Bowness, near Carlisle, and\r\nended at Wallsend, near Newcastle. It had battlements and towers to\r\ncontain soldiers. The more northern wall was renewed by Lollius Urbicus\r\nin the reign of Antoninus Pius, about 140. Many remains of these walls\r\nstill exist, particularly of the southern one.\r\n\r\n=Romans.= See ROME.\r\n\r\n=Rome= (anc. _Roma_). The most celebrated city of the world, either in\r\nancient or modern times, the capital of the Pontifical States, and the\r\necclesiastical metropolis of Catholic Christendom, is situated on the\r\nTiber, 17 miles northeast of its mouth in the Mediterranean. Rome is\r\nsaid to have been a colony from Alba Longa and to have been founded by\r\nRomulus about 753 B.C.; it grew rapidly in size and power. Regal Rome\r\nruled the whole Latin coast, and the treaties made with powerful\r\nCarthage, with Massilia, and with the Greeks of Southern Italy bear\r\nwitness to the respect it enjoyed abroad. Royalty was abolished, and an\r\naristocratical commonwealth established by the patricians, 509 B.C.; the\r\nLatins and the Tarquins declared war against the republic, 501; were\r\ndefeated at the Lake Regillus, 496 B.C. Military tribunes were first\r\ncreated in 444 B.C. Rome was engaged in war with the Tuscans, 434 B.C.;\r\nthe Æqui and Volsci were defeated by Tubertus, 431 B.C.; Veii was taken\r\nby Camillus after ten years’ siege, 396 B.C. In 390 B.C. Rome was\r\ncaptured and burned by the Gauls; the vigilance of Marcus Manlius saved\r\nthe Capitol. Again and again in the course of the 4th century B.C. the\r\nGallic hordes repeated their incursions, but never again returned\r\nvictorious. In 367 B.C. Camillus defeated them at Alba; in 360 B.C. they\r\nwere routed at the Colline Gate; in 358 B.C. by the dictator G.\r\nSulpicius Peticus; and in 350 B.C. by Lucius Furius Camillus. By the\r\nmiddle of the 4th century B.C. the whole of Southern Etruria had\r\nsubmitted to the supremacy of Rome, and was kept in check by a Roman\r\ngarrison; as was also the land of the Volsci. Becoming alarmed at the\r\nincreasing power of Rome, the Latins and Hernicans withdrew from their\r\nleague with Rome, and a severe and protracted struggle took place\r\nbetween them and their former ally. Nearly thirty years elapsed before\r\nthe Romans succeeded in crushing the malcontents, and restoring the\r\nleague of Spurius Cassius. In the course of this war the old Latin\r\nconfederacy of the “Thirty Cities” was broken up, 384 B.C. Rome made a\r\ntreaty with Carthage to repress Greek piracy, 348 B.C. Now commenced a\r\ntremendous struggle between the Samnites and the Romans; the former\r\nfighting heroically for the preservation of their national freedom,--the\r\nlatter warring with superb valor for dominion. The Samnite wars, of\r\nwhich three are reckoned, extended over 53 years (343-290). The victory\r\nof the Romans at Sentinum (295 B.C.) virtually ended the struggle. At\r\nthe close of the first Samnite war, an insurrection burst out among the\r\nLatins and Volscians, but the defeat inflicted on the insurgents at\r\nTrifanum (340 B.C.), by the Roman consul Titus Manlius Imperiosus\r\nTorquatos, almost instantly crushed it, and in two years almost the last\r\nspark of rebellion was extinguished. The famous Latin League was now\r\ndissolved. A mighty coalition was formed against Rome, consisting of\r\nEtruscans, Umbrians, and Gauls, in the north, and of Lucanians,\r\nBruttians, and Samnites, in the south, with a sort of tacit\r\nunderstanding on the part of the Tarentines that they would render\r\nassistance by and by. In the course of a single year the whole north was\r\nin arms, and once more the power and even the existence of Rome were in\r\ndeadly peril. An entire Roman army of 13,000 men was annihilated at\r\nArretium (284 B.C.); but Publius Cornelius Dolabella marched into the\r\ncountry of the Senones at the head of a large force, and literally\r\nextirpated the whole nation, which henceforth disappears from history.\r\nShortly afterwards, the bloody overthrow of the Etrusco-Boian horde at\r\nLake Vadimo (283 B.C.) shattered to pieces the northern confederacy. The\r\nLucanians were quickly overpowered (282 B.C.); Samnium, by its long and\r\nluckless struggle, and overawed by the proximity of a Roman army, could\r\ndo nothing. The Tarentines invited Pyrrhus over from Epirus, and\r\nappointed him commander of their mercenaries; he arrived in Italy with a\r\nsmall army of his own, 280 B.C. The war between Pyrrhus and the Romans,\r\nwhich lasted only six years, ended in his being obliged to return to\r\nEpirus without accomplishing anything; this war led to the complete\r\nsubjugation of Peninsular Italy by Rome. In 264 B.C. war was formally\r\ndeclared between Rome and Carthage, and it was incomparably the most\r\nterrible contest in which Rome was ever engaged. For details of the\r\nPunic wars, see CARTHAGE, NUMIDIA, and PUNIC WARS. The leading feature\r\nof the _first_ was the creation of a Roman navy, which, after repeated\r\nand tremendous misfortune, finally wrested from Carthage the sovereignty\r\nof the seas. A lapse of twenty-three years occurred before the _second_\r\nPunic war, during which interval the Romans bullied their weak and\r\nexhausted rival into surrendering Sardinia and Corsica. In addition they\r\nhad carried on a series of Gallic wars in Northern Italy (231-222 B.C.),\r\nthe result of which was the extension of Italy to the Alps. The Romans\r\nvigorously suppressed Illyrian piracy, 219 B.C. The grand events of the\r\nsecond Punic war were the crossing of the Alps by Hannibal, the terrible\r\ndisasters of the Romans at Lake Trasimene (see TRASIMENUS LACUS) and\r\nCannæ (which see), and the final overthrow of Hannibal at Zama (which\r\nsee), 202 B.C., by Scipio. The _second_ war virtually sealed the fate of\r\nCarthage, and the _third_ displayed only the frantic heroism of despair.\r\nThe imperial supremacy of Rome was now as unconditional in the western\r\nMediterranean as on the mainland of Italy. During 201-196 B.C. the Celts\r\nin the valley of the Po were thoroughly subjugated. The Boii were\r\nfinally extirpated about 193 B.C.; the Ligurians were subdued 180-177\r\nB.C.; and the interior of Corsica and Sardinia about the same time. The\r\nwars in Spain were troublesome and of longer duration, but they were not\r\nat all serious. The Romans suffered frequent defeats, but in the end the\r\nsuperior discipline of the legions always prevailed. The Romans felt it\r\nnecessary to hold Spain by military occupation, and hence arose the\r\nfirst Roman standing armies. The most distinguished successes were those\r\nachieved by Scipio himself, by Marcus Cato, by Lucius Æmilius Paulus, by\r\nCaius Calpurnius, by Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, and by Tiberius Gracchus.\r\nThe Macedonian wars were owing immediately to the alliance formed by\r\nPhilip V. of Macedon with Hannibal after the battle of Cannæ. The\r\nMacedonian wars were three in number. The _first_ (214-205 B.C.) was\r\nbarren in results; but the _second_ (200-197 B.C.) taught Philip that\r\nanother, not he, must rule in Greece. The battle of Cynoscephalæ was\r\nfollowed by a treaty which compelled him to withdraw his garrisons from\r\nthe Greek cities, to surrender his fleet, and pay 1000 talents toward\r\nthe expenses of the war. A similar fate befell Antiochus of Syria. Next\r\nthe Ætolians were crushed, and a little later the quarrels between the\r\nAchaians and Spartans led to a general Roman protectorate over the whole\r\nof Greece. The _third_ and last Macedonian war began 172 B.C.; the\r\nresult of which, after four years’ fighting, was the utter destruction\r\nof the Macedonian army at Pydna (168 B.C.), and the dismemberment of the\r\nMacedonian empire. The last Greek and Punic wars came to an end in the\r\nsame year (146 B.C.). The former was virtually closed on the\r\ndestruction of Corinth by the consul Mummius. For the results of the\r\nformer, see CARTHAGE. The Celtiberian and Numantine war began 153 B.C.,\r\nand ended in the final overthrow of the undisciplined and uncivilized\r\ncombatants, 133 B.C. Toward the conclusion of the Numantine war occurred\r\nthe first of those horrible Social outbreaks known as “servile” or\r\n“slave” wars, which marked the later ages of the republic. The first\r\nslave insurrection broke out in Sicily, 134 B.C. The slaves overran the\r\nisland, like demoniacs let loose, and routed one Roman army after\r\nanother. In 132 B.C., the consul Publius Rupilius restored order. After\r\na fierce struggle, the Romans obtained the kingdom of Pergamus, and\r\nformed it into the province of Asia, 129 B.C. In Africa, the overthrow\r\nof Jugurtha by the consul Marius added further to the renown and\r\nstrength of the republic. In 105 B.C. a Roman army of 80,000 was\r\nannihilated at Arausio on the Rhone, by the Cimbri (see ARAUSIO and\r\nCIMBRI). Marius nearly exterminated the Teutones at Aqua-Sextiæ (Aix, in\r\nDauphin), 102 B.C., and in 101 B.C. the Cimbri at the Campi Raudii near\r\nVercellæ. (See CIMBRI and TEUTONIC.) In the same year a second\r\ninsurrection of the slaves in Sicily was suppressed by the consul Marius\r\nAquillius. Now followed the Social war, 90-88 B.C. Then followed the\r\nfearful years of the “civil wars” between the two chiefs, Sulla and\r\nMarius. In 87 B.C. Rome was besieged by four armies (viz.: those of\r\nMarius, Cinna, Carbo, and Sertorius) and taken. In 88 B.C. broke out the\r\n“Mithridatic wars,” which were three in number; begun by Sulla 88 B.C.,\r\nthey were brought to a successful close by Pompey, 65 B.C., although the\r\ngeneral that had really broken the power of Mithridates was Lucullus.\r\n(See MITHRIDATIC WAR.) The result was the annexation of the sultanate of\r\nPontus, which was formed into a Roman province. Then Pompey conquered\r\nSyria; reduced to a state of dependence Phœnicia, Cæle-Syria, and\r\nPalestine, 63 B.C. In the same year the conspiracy of Catiline was\r\ncrushed by the consul Cicero. Then came the campaigns of Cæsar in Gaul\r\n(58-50 B.C.), by which the whole of the country was reduced to\r\nsubjection; his rupture with Pompey; his defiance of the senate; the\r\ncivil wars; his victory, dictatorship, and assassination; the second\r\ntriumvirate, composed of Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian; the overthrow of\r\nthe oligarchy at Philippi; the struggle between Antony and Octavian; the\r\ntriumph of the latter, and his investment with absolute power for life\r\nas Augustus Cæsar, which put an end at least to civil dissensions that\r\nhad raged so long. To keep the now enormous territory quiet which\r\ncontained so many different races, an army of forty-seven legions and as\r\nmany cohorts was maintained. The most notable incident during the reign\r\nof Tiberius was probably the concentration of the Prætorian guards in\r\nthe vicinity of Rome, who, until their dissolution by Diocletian, were\r\nthe real sovereigns of the empire. In Nero’s time Armenia was wrested\r\nfrom the Parthians; the Roman authority in England was likewise extended\r\nas far north as the Trent, and a great rebellion in Gaul, against Nero,\r\nheaded by Julius Vindex, was crushed by T. Virginius Rufus, the\r\ncommander of the Germanic legions. The chief military events from the\r\ndays of Vespasian to those of Marcus Aurelius, are final conquests of\r\nBritain by Agricola, the final conquest of the Dacian monarchy, the\r\nvictorious invasion of Parthia and Northern Arabia; and the conquest of\r\nthe valley of the Nile, as far south as Upper Nubia, by Trajan; the\r\nchastisement of the Marcomanni, Quadi, Chatti, etc., by Marcus Aurelius.\r\nThe reign of Alexander Severus is marked by the downfall of the Parthian\r\ndynasty of Persian kings, and the rise of the native Sassanidæ (which\r\nsee), which proved far more formidable enemies than the Parthian rulers.\r\nAfter the assassination of Severus (235 A.D.) followed a period of\r\nconfusion, bloodshed, and general mismanagement. The names of Maximin,\r\nMaximus, Balbinus, Gordianus, and Philip recall nothing but wretched\r\nquarrels, often ending in assassination. Then followed the “beginning of\r\nthe end.” The whole of Europe beyond the Roman frontier--the mysterious\r\nNorth--began to ferment. The Franks appeared on the Lower Rhine, the\r\nSuabians on the Maine; while the Goths burst through Dacia, routed the\r\nforces of Decius, slew the emperor himself at Mount Hæmus, crossed the\r\nEuxine, and ravaged the whole northern coast of Asia Minor. A little\r\nlater--during the reigns of Valerian, Gallienus, and the so-called\r\nThirty Tyrants--the empire was nothing but a wild distracted chaos;\r\nFranks, Alemanni, Goths, and Persians rushing from their respective\r\nquarters like vultures scenting prey. The Goths swept over the whole of\r\nAchaia, while the Asiatic hordes of Sapor committed even greater havoc\r\nin Syria and Asia Minor. By Claudius Gothicus (268-270), and his\r\nsuccessors, Aurelian, Probus, and Carus, the barbarians of the north and\r\nnorthwest, as well as the Persians in the East, were severely chastised.\r\nThe division of the empire into East and West by Diocletian led to those\r\nlabyrinthine confusions and civil wars, in which figure the names of\r\nMaximian, Constantius, Galerius, Maxentius, Maximin, Licinius, and\r\nConstantine, which were only brought to a close by the surpassing genius\r\nof the last mentioned. Julian’s efforts to repel the incessant\r\nincursions of the Franks and Alemanni displayed a fine valor and\r\ngeneralship, and were crowned with success. But after the death of\r\nJulian the signs of the approaching dissolution of the empire became\r\nmore unmistakable. Swarms of ferocious Huns drove the Goths out of\r\nDacia, and forced them to cross the Danube into the Roman territory,\r\nwhere they devastated the whole East from the Adriatic to the Euxine.\r\nThey were subdued and disarmed by Theodosius. Hardly was Theodosius dead\r\nwhen they rose again, under their chief Alaric, against Honorius,\r\nemperor of the West. Three years earlier, hordes of Suevi, Burgundians,\r\nAlemanni, Vandals, and Alans burst into Gaul, which led to the invasion\r\nof Africa by Genseric. In the East the Huns had reduced vast regions to\r\nan utter desert; for nearly fifty years, indeed, the little ferocious\r\ndemons had rioted in destruction. (See HUNS.) Eudoxia, the widow of\r\nValentinian, to be revenged on Valentinian’s murderer and successor,\r\nPetronius Maximus, invited Genseric, the “scourge of God,” over from\r\nAfrica, and exposed Rome to the horrors of pillage for fourteen days.\r\nLater, Odoacer, placing himself at the head of the barbarian mercenaries\r\nof the empire, overthrew the last, and the most ridiculous, occupant of\r\nthe throne of the Cæsars (476), who, by a curious coincidence, bore the\r\nsame name as the founder of the city,--Romulus. Rome was recovered for\r\nJustinian by Belisarius, 536; retaken by Totila the Goth, 546; recovered\r\nby Belisarius, 547; seized by Totila, 549; recovered by Narses and\r\nannexed to the Eastern empire, 553. Rome became independent under the\r\npopes about 728; was taken by Arnulf and the Germans, 896; taken by the\r\nemperor Henry IV., March, 1084. The pope removed to Avignon (1309-1377).\r\nRome was then virtually left without a government, the Guelphs and the\r\nGhibellines, Neapolitan and German armies, and the noble families of the\r\nOrsini and the Colonna being alternately masters. Cola di Rienzi, a man\r\nof the people, made himself master of Rome, 1347; it was captured and\r\npillaged by the Constable of Bourbon, 1527; it was harassed by the\r\nFrench, German, and Spanish factions from the 16th to the 18th\r\ncenturies; the French proclaimed a Roman republic, March 20, 1798; was\r\nrecovered for the pope by the Neapolitans, 1799; retaken by the French,\r\n1800; was restored to Pope Pius VII., 1801, and annexed by Napoleon to\r\nthe kingdom of Italy, 1808. It was restored to the pope, January, 1814.\r\nIn 1848 the people rose in rebellion, drove out Pius IX., and\r\nestablished a republic under the triumvirate of Mazzini, Armellini, and\r\nSaffi. An appeal to France brought once more a French army to the gates\r\nof the city, and the siege was begun. Rome was taken after a brave\r\nresistance in July, 1849. For twenty years French troops garrisoned the\r\nEternal City, and when they were at last withdrawn (1870) Italy had\r\nbecome one great nation. After a brief resistance from the foreign papal\r\ntroops, stopped by order of the pope, the Italian troops under Cadorna\r\nmade a breach, and entered Rome amid enthusiastic acclamation of the\r\npeople, September 20, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Rompu.= In heraldry, a term applied to a chevron when the upper part\r\nis taken off, and remains above it in the field.\r\n\r\n=Roncesvalles= (Fr. _Roncevaux_). A small Spanish village, province of\r\nNavarre, in a narrow valley inclosed by lofty mountains, through which\r\none of the principal roads leads from France across the Pyrenees into\r\nSpain. Here Charlemagne was attacked in 778 by the Basques, and his\r\nwhole rear-guard destroyed. In honor of those who had fallen he built a\r\nchapel on the spot where the battle took place, and among the names\r\nenumerated in the inscription was that of Roland. In the modern\r\nFrench-Spanish wars, several bloody encounters (in 1793, 1794, and 1813)\r\noccurred in the same valley, and in 1833, Don Carlos was first\r\nproclaimed king here.\r\n\r\n=Rondache= (_Fr._). In ancient armory, a circular shield carried by\r\nfoot-soldiers to protect the upper part of the person, having a slit in\r\nthe upper part for seeing through, and another at the side for the point\r\nof the sword to pass through.\r\n\r\n=Rondel.= In fortification, a round tower, sometimes erected at the foot\r\nof a bastion.\r\n\r\n=Rondelle= (_Fr._). A small round shield which was formerly used by\r\nlight-armed infantry.\r\n\r\n=Rondellier= (_Fr._). Archer or pikeman who carried the _rondelle_.\r\n\r\n=Rondells.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, NOMENCLATURE OF ARTILLERY\r\nCARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Ronfleurs= (_Fr._). Frederick the Great applied this name to some\r\n12-pounders of 22 calibers, weighing 3200 pounds, which, before the\r\nbattle of Leuthen, he had drawn from the neighboring fortress of Glogau.\r\nThe charge for this gun was 5 pounds.\r\n\r\n=Rope.= A large, stout, twisted cord, of not less, usually, than an inch\r\nin circumference. It differs from _cord_, _line_, and _string_ only in\r\nits size. Ropes are ranked under two descriptions, _cable-laid_ and\r\n_hawser-laid_; the former composed of nine strands, or three great\r\nstrands, each consisting of three small ones; the latter made with three\r\nstrands, each composed of a certain number of rope-yarns.\r\n\r\n=Rope, Drag-.= See DRAG-ROPE.\r\n\r\n=Rope-ferries.= See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Rose.= In heraldry, is drawn in a conventional form, and never with a\r\nstalk, except when expressly directed by the words of blazon. Being\r\nsometimes argent and sometimes gules, it cannot be designated proper;\r\nbut when blazoned “barbed and seeded proper,” it is meant that the barbs\r\nare to be green, and the seeds gold and yellow. The rose gules was the\r\nbadge of the Plantagenets of the house of Lancaster, and the rose argent\r\nof that of York. The York rose was sometimes surrounded with rays as of\r\nthe sun, and termed _rose en soleil_. As a mark of cadency, the rose has\r\nbeen used as the difference of the seventh son.\r\n\r\n=Roses, Wars of the.= A disastrous civil contest which desolated England\r\nduring thirty years, from 1455 to 1485, sacrificing 80 princes of the\r\nblood, and the larger proportion of the ancient nobility of the country.\r\nIt was so called because the two factions into which the country was\r\ndivided upheld the two several claims to the houses of York and\r\nLancaster, whose badges were the white and red roses, respectively.\r\nAfter the house of Lancaster had possessed the throne for three\r\ngenerations (see PLANTAGENET), Richard, duke of York, whose title was\r\nsuperior to that of Henry VI., began to advance, at first somewhat\r\ncovertly, his claim to the throne. In 1454, he was appointed protector\r\nof the realm during Henry’s illness, and on the king’s recovery he\r\ndeclined to give up his power, and levied an army to maintain it. The\r\naccession of Henry VII. may be said to have terminated the “wars of the\r\nroses,” although the reign of Henry was from time to time disturbed by\r\nthe pretensions of Yorkist impostors.\r\n\r\n=Rosetta.= A seaport city of Egypt, near the mouth of a branch of the\r\nNile. It was built by one of the Saracen caliphs in the 9th century. In\r\n1798 this place was taken by the French, and in 1807 it was besieged by\r\nthe British, who were repulsed by the Turks. The battle of the Nile was\r\nfought near Rosetta, August 1, 1798.\r\n\r\n=Rosettes.= Two small bunches of ribbons, that were attached to the\r\nloops by which the gorget of an officer was suspended on his chest.\r\n\r\n=Roslin.= A village of Scotland, 7 miles south of Edinburgh, on the Esk.\r\nIn this neighborhood the Scots gained three victories over the English\r\non the same day in 1302.\r\n\r\n=Ross, New.= A town of Ireland, situated partly in the county of\r\nWexford, and partly in the county of Kilkenny, 27 miles northwest from\r\nWexford. New Ross was taken by Cromwell in 1649, and in 1798 a severe\r\nbattle was fought here between the king’s troops and the Irish\r\ninsurgents.\r\n\r\n=Rossbach.= A village of Prussian Saxony, in the government of\r\nMerseburg, celebrated for the victory here gained by the Prussians under\r\nFrederick the Great over the allied French and Austrian armies, November\r\n5, 1757. The Prussians lost (according to a French account) only 300\r\nmen, while the loss of the allies was more than 1200 slain, 6000\r\nprisoners, among whom were 11 generals and 300 officers, and 72 cannon,\r\nwith many other trophies.\r\n\r\n=Roster=, or =Rollster=. List of officers for duty. The principle which\r\ngoverns details for duty is from the eldest down; longest off duty first\r\non duty. If an officer’s tour of duty for armed service, court-martial,\r\nor fatigue, happen when he is upon either duty, he is credited\r\ntherewith. An officer returning from duty after sickness, takes the same\r\nplace he had on the post roster before reporting sick; that being sick\r\non the day of detail he gets the credit of the tour and awaits the\r\nreturn of his day, when, if well, he is again detailed. An officer\r\nreturning from leave of absence is at once subject for detail.\r\nCustomarily, an officer who returns from detached service is placed at\r\nthe foot of the roster. The same rules should apply to non-commissioned\r\nofficers and privates. A regiment or detachment detailed for any duty,\r\nreceives credit for the duty when it marches off parade to perform the\r\nduty, but not if it is dismissed on parade. Officers on inlying pickets\r\nare subject to all details. In the British service, regiments proceed on\r\nforeign service according to the roster.\r\n\r\n=Rotterdam.= An important commercial city in Holland, in the province of\r\nSouthern Holland. Its importance dates from the 13th century; taken by\r\nthe Spaniards by stratagem in 1572, and cruelly treated. It suffered\r\nmuch from the French revolutionary wars.\r\n\r\n=Rouen.= A city in the north of France, the chief town of the department\r\nof the Lower Seine, and formerly the capital of Normandy, 68 miles\r\nnorthwest from Paris. It was held by the English till 1204; and was\r\nretaken by Henry V., January 19, 1419. Joan of Arc was burnt here, May\r\n30, 1431. It was taken by Charles VII. of France in 1449; and by the\r\nDuke of Guise from the Huguenots, October, 1552, and in 1591.\r\n\r\n=Rough Rider.= A non-commissioned officer in the British cavalry\r\nregiments, whose business it is to break in refractory horses, and\r\nassist the riding-master when required.\r\n\r\n=Rouleaux.= Are round bundles of fascines, which are tied together. They\r\nserve to cover men when the works are pushed close to a besieged town,\r\nor to mask the head of a work.\r\n\r\n=Round.= A general discharge of fire-arms by a body of troops, in which\r\neach soldier fires once. _Round of cartridges_, one cartridge to each\r\nman; as, to supply a regiment with a single round, or with twelve\r\nrounds.\r\n\r\n=Round, Gentleman of the.= A gentleman soldier, but of low rank, only\r\nabove the lance-pesade, whose office it was to visit and inspect the\r\nsentinels and advanced guards; also, one of a number of disbanded\r\nsoldiers who had betaken themselves to the trade of begging.\r\n\r\n=Round Robin.= This term is a corruption of _ruban rond_, which\r\nsignifies a round ribbon. It was usual among French officers, when they\r\nsigned a remonstrance, to write their names in a circular form, so that\r\nit was impossible to ascertain who signed first. Hence to sign a round\r\nrobin against any person, was for any specific number of men to sign,\r\none and all, a remonstrance against him.\r\n\r\n=Round Table, Knights of.= Known in early English history as knights\r\nbelonging to a celebrated order instituted by King Arthur, and whose\r\nexploits and adventures form the subjects of many ballads, and much of\r\nthe early romantic poetry of England. The members of the order are said\r\nto have been 40 in number, and to have derived their name from their\r\ncustom of sitting about a large, round, marble table, in order to avoid\r\nall distinction of rank.\r\n\r\n=Roundel=, or =Roundelle=. Was a shield used by the Norman soldiers. The\r\nword is also applied to the semicircular bastions in early\r\nfortification, as introduced by Albert Dürer. This bastion consisted of\r\na semicircle of masonry about 300 feet in diameter, containing roomy\r\ncasemates for the troops, and for artillery and musketry, with which the\r\nditch and curtains were flanked.\r\n\r\n=Roundheads, The.= In English history, a nickname given, in the reign of\r\nCharles I., to the Puritans, or Parliamentary party, who were accustomed\r\nto wear their hair cut close to the head. They were so called in\r\nopposition to the Cavaliers, or Royalists, who wore their hair in long\r\nringlets.\r\n\r\n=Roundle=, or =Roundlet=. In heraldry, a general name given to charges\r\nof a circular form, which in English heraldry have more special names\r\nindicative of their tinctures. A roundle or is called a _Bezant_; a\r\nroundle argent, a _Plate_; a roundle gules, a _Torteaux_; a roundle\r\nazure, a _Hurt_; a roundle sable, an _Ogress_, or _Pellet_; a roundle\r\npurpure, a _Golpe_; a roundle sanguine, a _Guze_; a roundle tenney, an\r\n_Orange_. In the heraldry of Scotland and of the continent, it is, on\r\nthe other hand, usual to design all roundles of metal bezants, and those\r\nof color, torteaux, adding the tincture. Thus the coat blazoned in\r\nEngland azure three plates, would be in the Scottish mode of blazon,\r\nazure three bezants argent.\r\n\r\n=Rounds.= An officer or non-commissioned officer who, attended by one or\r\nmore men, visits the sentinels in barracks, in order to ascertain\r\nwhether they are vigilant. There are two sorts of rounds, _grand_ and\r\n_visiting_. Grand rounds are the rounds which are gone by general\r\nofficers, commandants, or field-officers. When there are no officers of\r\nthe day, the officer of the main guard may go the grand rounds. The\r\ngrand rounds generally go at midnight; the visiting rounds at\r\nintermediate periods, between sunset and reveille. The grand rounds\r\nreceive the parole, and all other rounds give it to the guards. In\r\nofficers’ rounds the officer guarding is preceded by a drummer carrying\r\na lantern, and followed by a sergeant and a file of men. Ordinary rounds\r\nconsist of a sergeant and a file of men. Both ordinary and officers’\r\nrounds are termed visiting rounds. The design of _rounds_ is not only to\r\nvisit the guards, and keep the sentinels alert, but likewise to discover\r\nwhat passes in the outworks, and beyond them.\r\n\r\n=Rout.= The confusion created in an army or body of troops when defeated\r\nor dispersed. _To put to the rout_, is to defeat and throw into\r\nconfusion. The term expresses more than a defeat, because it implies a\r\ndispersion of the enemy’s forces; for a defeated enemy may retreat in\r\ngood order; but when routed, order and discipline are at an end.\r\n\r\n=Route.= An open road; the course of march of troops. Instructions for\r\nthe march of detachments, specifying daily marches, means of supply,\r\netc., are given from the headquarters of an army in the field, and are\r\ncalled marching routes.\r\n\r\n=Route Step.= In tactics, is a style of march whereby the men carry\r\ntheir arms at will, keeping the muzzles elevated; they are not required\r\nto preserve silence, or to keep the step, but each man covers the file\r\nin his front. The ranks preserve the distance of 32 inches from each\r\nother. The route step is at the rate of from 2¹⁄₂ to 3 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n=Routine.= This word has been adopted by us in the same sense that it is\r\nfamiliarly used by the French. It signifies capacity, or the faculty of\r\narranging; a certain method in business, civil or military, which is as\r\nmuch acquired by habit and practice as by regular study and rule. We say\r\nfamiliarly the routine of business.\r\n\r\n=Rowel.= The pointed part of a riding spur, which is made in a circular\r\nform, with rays or points like a star.\r\n\r\n=Royal.= A small mortar which carries a shell whose diameter is 5.5\r\ninches. It is mounted on a bed the same as other mortars.\r\n\r\n=Royal.= In England, one of the soldiers of the first regiment of foot,\r\ncalled the _Royals_, and supposed to be the oldest regular corps in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n=Rubicon.= A small stream of Central Italy, falling into the Adriatic,\r\nhas obtained a proverbial celebrity from the well-known story of its\r\npassage by Cæsar, who by crossing this river--which, at the outbreak of\r\nthe civil war between him and Pompey, formed the southern boundary of\r\nhis province--virtually declared war against the republic. Hence the\r\nphrase to “cross the Rubicon” has come to mean, to take an irrevocable\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n=Rudiments.= The first principles, the elements of any particular\r\nscience; as, the rudiments of war, which are the first principles or\r\nelements of war; as, marching, facing, wheeling; the drill, manual, and\r\nplatoon exercises, manœuvres, etc.\r\n\r\n=Ruffle.= Is a low vibrating sound, less loud than a roll, produced by\r\ndrummers. It is used as a compliment to general officers and at military\r\nfunerals.\r\n\r\n=Rugen.= The largest of the islands of Germany, belongs to Prussia, and\r\nlies in the Baltic, off the coast of Pomerania. In 1169 it was conquered\r\nby the Danish king Waldemar I. By the peace of Westphalia it was ceded\r\nto Sweden, but in 1815 it was transferred to Prussia.\r\n\r\n=Rules and Articles of War.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR.\r\n\r\n=Run.= The greatest degree of swiftness in marching. It is executed upon\r\nthe same principles as the _double-quick_, but with greater speed.\r\n\r\n=Run the Gantlope.= See GANTLOPE.\r\n\r\n=Running Fight.= A battle in which one party flees and the other\r\npursues, but the party fleeing keeps up the contest.\r\n\r\n=Running Fire.= A constant fire of musketry or cannon.\r\n\r\n=Rupture.= This word signifies the commencement of hostilities between\r\nany two or more powers.\r\n\r\n=Rusellæ= (_Rusellanus_; ruins near _Grosseto_). One of the most ancient\r\ncities of Etruria. It was taken by the Romans in 294 B.C., when 2000 of\r\nits inhabitants were slain, and as many more were made prisoners.\r\n\r\n=Rush.= To move or drive forward with impetuosity, violence, and\r\ntumultuous rapidity; as, armies rush to battle. Also, a driving forward\r\nwith eagerness and haste; as, a rush of troops.\r\n\r\n=Russia.= The largest empire of the world, occupying about one-sixth of\r\nthe firm land of our globe, bounded north by the Arctic Ocean, east by\r\nthe Pacific, south by China, Independent Toorkistan, Persia, Asiatic\r\nTurkey, the Black Sea, and Roumania, and west by Austria, Prussia, the\r\nBaltic, and the Scandinavian peninsula. When the Greeks founded their\r\ncommercial stations along the northern coast of the Black Sea, in the\r\nCrimea, and on the shores of the Sea of Azof, they found the interior\r\noccupied by roving tribes of a fierce and savage character. They called\r\nthem Scythians and Sarmatians, and for about eight centuries these two\r\nnations continued to be mentioned in the history of Greece and Rome as\r\ninhabiting the same country, pursuing the same occupations, etc. Then\r\ncame, during the migration of nations beginning in the 4th century, the\r\nGoths, Avars, Huns, Alans, etc., rolling over them wave after wave. In\r\nthe 6th century the name of the Slaves first appears. They founded Kiev\r\nand Novgorod. The name of _Russians_ is first met with in the 9th\r\ncentury. Rurik, a Varangian chief, came to Novgorod in 862, not as a\r\nconqueror, but invited, and henceforth his family reigned in the country\r\ntill it became extinct, and the people received the name of Russians.\r\nHis successor, Oleg (879-912), conquered Kief, defeated the Khazars, and\r\neven attacked the emperor of Constantinople. In the beginning of the\r\n13th century, the Mongols under Genghis Khan broke in from Asia; the\r\nRussians were unable to withstand them. Most of the princes were wholly\r\nsubdued. The brilliant victories of Demetrius Donski, prince of Moscow,\r\nin 1378 and 1380, only caused the Mongols to return in larger hordes; in\r\n1382, Moscow was burned to the ground and 24,000 of its inhabitants were\r\nslain. Ivan III. the Great (1462-1505), who united Novgorod, Perm, and\r\nPskov to Moscow, refused to pay the tribute to the Mongols, defeated\r\nthem when they attempted to enforce their claim by arms, and commenced\r\nextending the Russian power to the east, conquering Kazan in 1469, and\r\nparts of Siberia in 1499. Ivan IV., the Terrible (1533-84), conquered\r\nAstrakhan in 1554, the land of the Don Cossacks in 1570, Siberia in\r\n1581, opened a road to Archangel in 1553, and organized in 1545 a\r\nbody-guard, the famous _Streltzi_. With his son Feodor I. (1584-98) the\r\nhouse of Rurik ceased to exist, and after a protracted and\r\nsevere struggle between Boris Godunoff, Basil V., and the two\r\npseudo-Demetriuses, who were supported by the Poles, Michael\r\nFeodorovitch Romanoff, the founder of the present dynasty, ascended the\r\nthrone in 1612. Some progress was made under each of his\r\nsuccessors,--Catharine I. (1725-27), Peter II. (1727-30), Anne\r\n(1730-41), Elizabeth (1741-62). Catharine II. (1762-76) carried on\r\nsuccessful wars with Persia, Sweden, and Turkey, conquering the Crimea;\r\nshe also acquired Courland and half of Poland. (For history regarding\r\nPoland, see POLAND.) Under Alexander I. (1801-25) Russia appears not\r\nonly as one of the great powers, but as the true arbiter in European\r\npolitics. In the Napoleonic wars he sided first with Austria, and was\r\nbeaten at Austerlitz; then with Prussia, and was beaten at Friedland. By\r\nthe peace of Frederikshamn (1809) he obtained Finland from Sweden; by\r\nthe peace of Bucharest (1812), Bessarabia and Moldavia from Turkey; and\r\nthe war with Persia was successfully progressing when his friendship\r\nwith Napoleon suddenly began to wane. A rupture took place, and now\r\nfollowed with fearful rapidity the invasion of Russia by Western Europe,\r\nthe destruction of the grand army, and the overthrow of Napoleon. By the\r\npeace of Paris (1856) Russia lost its supremacy in the Black Sea. (See\r\nCRIMEA.) It only bided its time, however, and October 31, 1870, when\r\nneither England, France, nor Turkey was able to resist, Prince\r\nGortschakoff informed the various cabinets that Russia felt compelled to\r\ndeviate from the stipulations of the treaty of Paris, and keep a fleet\r\nof sufficient capacity in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n=Russo-German War.= The name given by German historians to the last\r\nstage of the great European war against Napoleon, beginning with the\r\nRussian campaign of 1812, and terminating on the field of Waterloo. For\r\nimportant battles, etc., see appropriate headings.\r\n\r\n=Russo-Turkish War.= The name applied to the war which took place\r\nbetween Russia on one side, and Turkey, France, and Great Britain on the\r\nother; it commenced in 1853 and terminated in 1856. For important events\r\nof this war, see appropriate headings.\r\n\r\n=Rustre.= In heraldry, one of the subordinaries, consisting of a\r\n_lozenge_ with a circular opening pierced in its centre. Ancient armor\r\nwas sometimes composed of rustres sewed on cloth.\r\n\r\n=Rustschuk.= A fortified town of Turkey in Europe, in Bulgaria, situated\r\nat the influx of the Kara Lom into the Danube, 67 miles southwest from\r\nSilitria. Giurgevo (which see) is almost immediately opposite. The\r\nRussians took these towns in 1711 and 1810, but were defeated by the\r\nTurks, before Giurgevo, in 1854.\r\n\r\n=Rutuli.= An ancient people in Italy, inhabiting a narrow slip of\r\ncountry on the east coast of Latium, a little to the south of the Tiber.\r\nThey were subdued at an early period by the Romans, and disappeared from\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n=Ryswick.= A village in the province of South Holland, where the\r\ncelebrated treaty of peace was concluded between England, France, Spain,\r\nand Holland, and was signed by their representatives, September 20, and\r\nby the emperor of Germany, October 30, 1697.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Saalfeld.= A town of Germany, in the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, on the\r\nSaale, 23 miles south from Weimar. Here the Prussians under Prince Louis\r\nFrederick of Prussia were defeated and their leader slain by the French\r\nunder Lannes, October 10, 1806.\r\n\r\n=Saarbrück= (anc. _Augusti Mari_, or _Saræpons_). An open town on the\r\nleft bank of the Saar, in Rhenish Prussia. It was founded in the 10th\r\ncentury, and was long subject to the bishops of Metz; it was afterwards\r\nruled by counts (about 1237), and by the house of Nassau about 1380. It\r\nwas captured by the French and retaken by the Germans, 1676; reunited to\r\nFrance, 1794-1814, and ceded to Prussia, 1815. On August 2, 1870, it was\r\nbombarded by the French under Frossard, and the Prussians in small force\r\nwere dislodged, and the town occupied by the French general Bataille.\r\nThe emperor Napoleon and his son were present during this bombardment.\r\nOn August 6, the Prussian generals Goeben and Von Steinmetz, with the\r\nfirst army, recaptured Saarbrück, after a sanguinary conflict at the\r\nvillage of Spicheren. The heights taken by the French on the 2d are in\r\nGermany, those taken by the Germans on the 6th are in France, and both\r\nbattles were fought between Saarbrück and the town of Forbach, which was\r\ncaptured and has given a name to the second conflict. The loss was great\r\non both sides. The French general François was killed, and the 2d Corps\r\nunder Frossard nearly destroyed. The French retreated to Metz. They were\r\ngreatly superior in numbers at the beginning of the fight, but were\r\nbadly commanded.\r\n\r\n=Sabander.= The familiar of _shah-bander_, an Eastern title for captain\r\nor governor of a post.\r\n\r\n=Sabantines.= Steel coverings for the feet; sometimes slippers or clogs.\r\n\r\n=Sabbatons.= A round-toed armed covering for the feet, worn during a\r\npart of the 16th century.\r\n\r\n=Sabini.= An ancient people of Central Italy, were generally supposed to\r\nhave derived their name from Sabus, their chief tutelary deity. Their\r\nantiquity was very great. They were the parent-stock of many of the\r\nneighboring tribes, such as the Samnites, the Peligni, and the Picentes.\r\nThe Sabini inhabited the mountain region lying to the northeast of Rome.\r\nThey were a valiant warlike race, and at an early age of authentic\r\nhistory they issued from their mountain fastness and began a system of\r\nwarlike aggression upon their neighbors. Gradually and by repeated\r\nattacks, their invading hordes subdued the aborigines, and advanced\r\nsouthward, occupying the land. At length, pushing their outposts to the\r\nvery gates of Rome, they commenced to interfere with the affairs of that\r\nrising city. By victory or by compromise they gained admittance into the\r\nstate upon very advantageous terms. They were not satisfied, but\r\npersisted in their encroachments upon the Roman territory, until\r\ndefeated by Tullus Hostilius and by Tarquinius Priscus; however, they\r\ncontinued their raids until 449 B.C., when M. Horatius gave them a\r\ndefeat which kept them quiet for more than a century and a half. They\r\nrecovered in 290 B.C., only to be overthrown by Manlius Curius Dentatus\r\nwith greater completeness than ever. They finally became a part of the\r\nRoman empire.\r\n\r\n=Sable.= One of the tinctures in heraldry, implying black. In heraldic\r\nengravings, it is represented by perpendicular and horizontal lines\r\ncrossing each other.\r\n\r\n=Sabot.= Is a thick, circular disk of wood, to which, in fixed\r\nammunition, the cartridge-bag and projectile are attached. For a\r\nspherical projectile, the sabot has a spherical cavity, and circular\r\ngroove to which the cartridge-bag is tied; in the canister-sabot, the\r\nspherical cavity is omitted, and a circular offset is added. The effects\r\nof a sabot are: (1) To prevent the formation of a _lodgment_ in the\r\nbore. (2) To moderate the action of the powder on the projectile; and,\r\n(3) To prevent the projectile from moving from its place. In consequence\r\nof the scattering of the fragments, it is dangerous to use the sabot in\r\nfiring over the heads of one’s own men. The term is also applied to the\r\nsoft metal device attached to the base of rifled projectiles to take the\r\ngrooves of the bore.\r\n\r\n=Sabre.= A long curved or straight cavalry sword, with a broad and heavy\r\nblade, used for cutting and thrusting.\r\n\r\n=Sabre.= To strike, cut, or kill with a sabre.\r\n\r\n=Sabretache= (Ger. _Sabeltasche_, “sword-pocket”). A square pocket or\r\npouch suspended from the sword-belt on the left side, by three slings\r\nto correspond with the belt. It is usually scolloped at the bottom, has\r\na device in the centre, and a broad lace round the edge. The color of it\r\nalways corresponds with that of the uniform. The sabretache is an\r\nappointment or part of accoutrement of hussars in European armies.\r\n\r\n=Sabreur= (_Fr._). A blood-thirsty soldier; brave soldier.\r\n\r\n=Sabugal.= A town of Portugal, on the Spanish frontier, where an affair\r\ntook place between an English light division and the French, April 3,\r\n1811, in which the latter were defeated.\r\n\r\n=Sac and Fox Indians.= Two Algonkin tribes, who have always associated.\r\nThey formerly dwelt in Canada, but afterward occupied a large tract of\r\nland on both sides of the Mississippi. The Sacs and Foxes often engaged\r\nin wars with the English, French, and Indians. They were gradually\r\nremoved southwestward prior to 1849. There are now in the Indian\r\nTerritory about 400 Sacs and Foxes. There are also about 200 Sacs and\r\nFoxes in Kansas, about 100 in Nebraska, and about 300 Sacs and Foxes in\r\nIowa. See FOX INDIANS.\r\n\r\n=Sacæ.= One of the most numerous and powerful of the Scythian nomad\r\ntribes, had their abodes in the steppes of Central Asia, which are now\r\npeopled by the _Kirghiz Khasaks_. They were very warlike, and excelled\r\nespecially as cavalry, and as archers, both on horse and foot. Their\r\nwomen shared in their military spirit; and according to Ælian, they had\r\nthe custom of settling before marriage whether the man or woman should\r\nrule the house, by the result of a combat between them. In early times\r\nthey extended their predatory incursions as far west as Armenia and\r\nCappadocia.

A kingdom of Soodan, in Central Africa. Its\r\ninhabitants, the Fellatas, first made their appearance as conquerors,\r\ncoming from the west, apparently from the Senegal; they profess the\r\nMohammedan religion.

A wealthy and warlike town of ancient\r\nSpain, in Hispania Tarraconensis. It was besieged and destroyed by the\r\nCarthaginians under Hannibal in 218 B.C. Having withstood the siege for\r\nthe greater part of a year, against an army of about 150,000 men, the\r\nSaguntines, now most severely pressed by famine, concluded, with an act\r\nof heroic defiance and self-sacrifice, a resistance that had been\r\ncharacterized by the most brilliant valor. Heaping their valuable\r\neffects into one vast pile, and placing their women and children around\r\nit, the men issued forth for the last time against the enemy; and the\r\nwomen, setting fire to the pile they had prepared, cast themselves upon\r\nit with their children, and found in flames the fate their husbands met\r\nin battle. The destruction of Saguntum directly led to the second Punic\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n=Saikyr.= In the Middle Ages, was a species of cannon smaller than a\r\ndemiculverin, much employed in sieges. Like the falcon, it derived its\r\nname from a species of hawk.\r\n\r\n=Saint Augustine.= A city, port of entry, and capital of St. John’s Co.,\r\nFla., 160 miles south of Savannah. It has the distinction of being the\r\noldest town in the United States. The Spanish abandoned it in 1763, upon\r\nits cession to the English. Sir Francis Drake destroyed it in 1586; and\r\nit was besieged and burned by the governor of the Carolinas in 1702.\r\nSaint Augustine was a British depot during the Revolutionary war.

The nurses were at first known as the\r\nHospitaller Brothers of St. John the Baptist of Jerusalem. The Seljuk\r\n(Seljook) Turks, who succeeded the Egyptian and Arabian Saracens in\r\nPalestine, plundered the hospice, and on the conquest of Jerusalem by\r\nthe Crusaders under Geoffroy de Bouillon in 1099, the first superior,\r\nGérard, was found in prison. Released from durance, he resumed his\r\nduties in the hospice, and was joined by several of the Crusaders, who\r\ndevoted themselves to the service of the poor pilgrims. By advice of\r\nGérard, the brethren took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience\r\nbefore the Patriarch of Jerusalem. Pope Pascal II. gave his sanction to\r\nthe institution in 1113. After Gérard’s death in 1118, Raymond du Pay\r\nsucceeded as superior of the order, and to the former obligations of the\r\norder he added those of fighting against the infidels and defending the\r\nHoly Sepulchre. Various Hospices, called _commanderies_, were\r\nestablished in different maritime towns of Europe. The order having\r\nbecome military as well as religious, was recruited by persons of high\r\nrank and influence, and wealth flowed in on it from all quarters. On the\r\nconquest of Jerusalem by Saladin in 1187, the Hospitallers retired to\r\nMargate, Phœnicia, whence the progress of infidel arms drove them first,\r\nin 1285, to Acre, and afterwards, in 1291, to Limisso, where Henry II.,\r\nking of Cyprus, assigned them a residence. By the statutes of Raymond,\r\nthe brethren consisted of three classes,--_knights_, _chaplains_, and\r\n_serving brothers_; these last being fighting squires, who followed the\r\nknights in their expeditions. The order was subsequently divided into\r\neight languages,--Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Aragon, England,\r\nGermany, and Castile. Each nation possessed several Grand Priories,\r\nunder which were a number of commanderies. The chief establishment in\r\nEngland was the Priory of Clerkenwell, whose head had a seat in the\r\nupper house of Parliament, and was styled first baron of England. In\r\n1310, the knights, under their grand master, Foulkes de Villaret, in\r\nconjunction with a party of Crusaders from Italy, captured Rhodes and\r\nseven adjacent islands from the Greek and Saracen pirates, by whom they\r\nwere then occupied, and carried on from thence a successful war against\r\nthe Saracens. In 1523, they were compelled to surrender Rhodes to the\r\nsultan Solyman, and retired first to Candia, and afterward to Viterbo.\r\nIn 1530, Charles V. assigned them the island of Malta, with Tripolis and\r\nGozo. The knights continued for some time to be a powerful bulwark\r\nagainst the Turks; but after the Reformation a moral degeneracy\r\noverspread the order, and it rapidly declined in political importance;\r\nand in 1798, through the treachery of some French knights and the\r\ncowardice of the grand master, D’Hompesch, Malta was surrendered to the\r\nFrench. The lands still belonging to the order were also about this time\r\nconfiscated in almost all the European states; but though extinct as a\r\nsovereign body, the order has continued during the present century to\r\ndrag on a lingering existence in some parts of Italy, as well as in\r\nRussia and Spain. Since 1801, the office of grand master has not been\r\nfilled up; a deputy grand master has instead been appointed, who has his\r\nresidence in Spain. The order at first wore a long black habit, with a\r\npointed hood adorned with a cross of white silk, of the form called\r\nMaltese, on the left breast, as also a golden cross in the middle of the\r\nbreast. In their military capacity, they wore red surcoats with a silver\r\ncross before and behind. The badge worn by all the knights is a Maltese\r\ncross, enameled white, and edged with gold; it is suspended by a black\r\nribbon, and the embellishments attached to it differ in the different\r\ncountries where the order still exists.\r\n\r\n=Saint Louis.= A city of St. Louis Co., Mo., which stands on the right\r\nbank of the Mississippi, 18 miles below its confluence with the\r\nMissouri, and 174 miles above the mouth of the Ohio. In 1764, Saint\r\nLouis was the depot of the Louisiana Indian trading company; in 1768 it\r\nwas captured by a detachment of Spanish troops; and in 1804 was ceded\r\nwith the whole country west of the Mississippi to the United States.\r\nDuring the civil war a hostile camp of State militia was captured near\r\nthe city, which enabled the Federals to secure the arsenal and a great\r\nstore of arms, and eventual possession of the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n=St. Lucia.= An island in the West Indies, taken from the French in\r\nJune, 1803, by the English troops under Gen.

A\r\nbattle was fought here August 10, 1557, between the Spaniards assisted\r\nby a body of English troops, and the French, in which the latter were\r\nseverely defeated. A battle took place here between the French under\r\nFaidherbe and the Germans under Von Goeben on January 19, 1871, in\r\nwhich the former were defeated, and the latter occupied Saint-Quentin.\r\n\r\n=Saint Regis.= Situated partly in Bombay township, Franklin Co., N. Y.,\r\nand partly in St. Regis township, Huntingdon Co., Quebec, Canada, on the\r\nSt. Lawrence River, opposite Cornwall, with which it is connected by\r\nferry. It is inhabited by the St. Regis Indians, an Iroquois tribe\r\nspeaking the Mohawk dialect. They are divided into two parties, the\r\nBritish and the American, and owe their allegiance not according to\r\nresidence, but according to descent in the female line. Their\r\nreservation in the United States is 14,000 acres, and that in Canada\r\nrather larger. Their ancestors settled here in 1760. The American party\r\nnumber about 700 souls, and the British about 800.\r\n\r\n=Saint Vincent, Cape.= See CAPE ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n=Saintes.= A town of France, in the department of the Lower Charente,\r\nsituated on the left bank of the Charente. The English were defeated\r\nhere in 1242, by the French king Louis IX., afterwards Saint Louis.\r\n\r\n=Saker= (Fr. _sacre_, _sacret_). An ancient 4- or 5-pounder of 13 feet,\r\nweighing from 2500 to 2800 pounds.

Helmet or kind of iron hat with a grated, movable\r\nvisor, which was worn during the 15th century by foot-soldiers.\r\n\r\n=Saladin.= At first the coat of arms was so called, because the\r\nChristians who conquered Palestine assumed it in imitation of the Turks,\r\nwhose chief was at that time Saladin.\r\n\r\n=Salahieh= (written also _Selahieh_). A town of Lower Egypt, 37 miles\r\nnortheast of Belbeys. It was taken by the French in 1798, and again in\r\n1800.\r\n\r\n=Salamanca= (anc. _Salmantica_). A famous town of Spain, capital of the\r\nmodern province of the same name, on the right bank of the Tormes, 50\r\nmiles east-northeast from Ciudad Rodrigo. It was taken by Hannibal. It\r\nwas almost totally destroyed by the French in 1812. In its vicinity was\r\nwon one of the most famous victories of the Peninsular war, by the\r\nBritish under Wellington against the French under Marmont, July 22,\r\n1812.\r\n\r\n=Salapia= (_Salapinus_; now _Salpi_). An ancient town of Apulia, was\r\nsituated south of Sipontum. During the second Punic war it revolted to\r\nHannibal after the battle of Cannæ, but it subsequently surrendered to\r\nthe Romans and delivered to the latter the Carthaginian garrison.\r\n\r\n=Salassi.= A brave and warlike people in Gallia Transpadana, in the\r\nvalley of the Duria, at the foot of the Graian and Pennine Alps. They\r\ndefended the passes of the Alps in their territory with such obstinacy\r\nand courage that it was long before the Romans were able to subdue\r\nthem. At length in the reign of Augustus, the country was permanently\r\noccupied by Terrentius Varro with a powerful Roman force; most of the\r\nSalassi were destroyed in battle and the rest, amounting to 36,000, were\r\nsold as slaves.\r\n\r\n=Salenckemen.= On the Danube; here a victory was gained by the\r\nImperialists, under Prince Louis of Baden, over the Turks, commanded by\r\nthe grand vizier Mustapha Kiuprigli, August 19, 1691.\r\n\r\n=Salentini=, or =Sallentini=.

A town of Naples, capital of the province\r\nof Principato Citra, 30 miles southeast from Naples. It was captured\r\nduring the Social war by the Samnite general Papius. After the fall of\r\nthe Western empire Salerno rose to its height. It passed first into the\r\nhands of the Goths, then into those of the Lombards, from whom it was\r\ntaken by the Saracens in 905; but fifteen years after, it was recovered\r\nby the Greek emperor, and subsequently reverted to the Lombards. In 1076\r\nSalerno was taken, after a siege of eight months, by Robert Guiscard;\r\nand thenceforward became the capital of the Norman possessions south of\r\nthe Apennines. In 1193 the town was destroyed by the emperor Henry VI.\r\n\r\n=Salient.= In heraldry, an attitude of a lion or other beast, differing\r\nbut slightly from rampant.

The name is applied to\r\nthe postern leading from under the rampart into the ditch; but its more\r\nmodern application is to a cutting through the glacis, by which a sally\r\nmay be made from the covert way. When not in use, sally-ports are closed\r\nby massive gates of timber and iron.\r\n\r\n=Salsette.= An island on the west coast of Hindustan, formerly separated\r\nfrom Bombay by a narrow channel 200 yards wide, across which a causeway\r\nwas carried in 1805. Salsette formed part of the province of Aurungabad\r\nunder the Mogul emperors; but fell into the hands of the Portuguese soon\r\nafter their settlement in India. In 1739 it was conquered by the\r\nMahrattas, and in 1774 it was taken by the British.\r\n\r\n=Saltant.= In heraldry, in a leaping position, springing\r\nforward;--applied especially to the squirrel, weasel, rat, and also to\r\nthe cat, greyhound, monkey, etc.\r\n\r\n=Saltillo.= A city of Mexico, capital of the state of Coahuila, 250\r\nmiles west-southwest of Matamoras.

Its name is of uncertain\r\netymology, representing a bend sinister conjoined with a bend dexter, or\r\na cross placed transversely like the letter X. Like the other\r\nordinaries, it probably originated, as Planché suggests, in the clamps\r\nand braces of the shield. The form of the saltire has been assigned to\r\nthe cross on which St. Andrew is said to have been crucified; hence the\r\nfrequency of this ordinary in Scotch heraldry. A saltire is subject to\r\nthe variations of being engrailed, invented, etc., and may be _couped_.\r\nWhen two or more saltires are borne in a shield, they are couped, not at\r\nright angles, but horizontally; and as they are always so treated, it is\r\nconsidered superfluous to blazon them as couped. Charges disposed in the\r\nform of a saltire are described as placed _saltireways_, or _in\r\nsaltire_. The former term is more properly applied to two long charges,\r\nas swords or keys, placed across one another (in which case the rule is,\r\nthat the sword in bend sinister should be uppermost, unless otherwise\r\nblazoned); and the latter to five charges placed two, one, and two.\r\n\r\n=Saltpetre.= Nitre, or nitrate of potassa, is composed of 54 parts\r\nnitric acid and 48 parts of potassa. It is spontaneously generated in\r\nthe soil, and is a necessary ingredient of powder. It has occasionally\r\nbeen produced artificially in _nitre-beds_, formed of a mixture of\r\ncalcareous soil with animal matter; in these, nitrate of lime is slowly\r\nformed, which is extracted by lixiviation and carbonate of potash added\r\nto the solution, which gives rise to the formation of nitrate of potassa\r\nand carbonate of lime; the latter is precipitated; the former remains in\r\nsolution and is obtained in crystals by evaporation. Its great use is in\r\nthe manufacture of gunpowder, and in the production of nitric acid. See\r\nGUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=Salute.= A discharge of artillery in compliment to some individual;\r\nbeating of drums and dropping of colors for the same purpose; or by\r\nearning or presenting arms according to the rank and position of an\r\nofficer. A salute with cannon is a certain number of arms fired in\r\nsuccession with blank cartridges, in honor of a person, to celebrate an\r\nevent, or to show respect to the flag of a country. The rapidity with\r\nwhich the pieces are discharged depends upon their caliber. Field-guns\r\nshould have intervals of five seconds between discharges; siege-guns,\r\neight; and guns of heavier caliber, ten. The minimum number of pieces\r\nwith which salutes can be fired is 2 for field, 4 for siege, and 6 for\r\nsea coast guns.\r\n\r\nPersonages entitled to salutes, if _passing_ a military post, as also\r\nforeign ships of war, are saluted with guns of heavy caliber, the most\r\nsuitable being the 10-inch smooth-bore. The United States _national_\r\nsalute is one for each State composing the Union; and the\r\n_international_ salute, or salute to the national flag, is 21 guns. The\r\nPresident of the United States and the sovereign or chief magistrate of\r\na foreign state receive a salute of 21 guns, both upon arrival and final\r\ndeparture from a military post. Members of the royal family,--_i.e._,\r\nthe heir-apparent and consort of the reigning sovereign of a foreign\r\nstate,--21 guns. The Vice-President of the United States receives a\r\nsalute of 19 guns. The following civil and diplomatic authorities\r\nreceive salutes as follows: members of the Cabinet, the chief justice,\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives, the governors within their\r\nrespective States or Territories, a committee of Congress officially\r\nvisiting a military post or station, the viceroy, governor-general, or\r\ngovernors of provinces belonging to foreign states, ambassadors\r\nextraordinary and plenipotentiary, 17 guns; envoys extraordinary and\r\nministers plenipotentiary, 15 guns; ministers resident accredited to the\r\nUnited States, 13 guns; chargés d’affaires, or subordinate diplomatic\r\nagents left in charge of missions in the United States, 11 guns. A\r\ngeneral-in-chief, field-marshal, or admiral receives a salute of 17\r\nguns; a lieutenant-general, or vice-admiral, 15 guns; a major-general,\r\nor rear-admiral, 13 guns; a brigadier-general, or commodore, 11 guns.\r\nThe officers of volunteers and militia, when in the service of the\r\nUnited States, receive the salute specified for their rank. Officers of\r\nforeign services visiting any military post, are saluted in accordance\r\nwith their rank. Salutes are fired only between _sunrise_ and _sunset_,\r\nand, as a rule, never on Sunday. A national salute is to be fired at\r\nnoon on the anniversary of the independence of the United States at each\r\nmilitary post and camp provided with artillery and ammunition. The\r\n_international_ salute is the only salute that is returned, and this\r\nshould be done as soon as possible; foreign ships of war, in return for\r\na similar compliment, gun for gun on notice being officially received of\r\nsuch intention. If there be several forts in sight of or within 6 miles\r\nof each other, the principal only shall reciprocate compliments with\r\nships in passing. The President of the United States, the sovereign or\r\nchief magistrate of a foreign country traveling in a public capacity, is\r\nsaluted when _passing_ in the vicinity of a military post. Personal\r\nsalutes at the same place and in compliment to the same person, whether\r\ncivil, diplomatic, military, or naval, are never to be fired oftener\r\nthan once in twelve months, unless such person has, in the mean time,\r\nbeen advanced in rank.\r\n\r\n=Salvo.= Is a concentrated fire from a greater or less number of pieces\r\nof artillery. Against a body of men, a salvo is generally useless, as\r\nthe moral effect is greater in proportion to the area over which\r\ndevastation is spread; but with fortifications the case is otherwise.\r\nFor the purpose of breaching, the simultaneous concussion of a number of\r\ncannon-balls on masonry, or even earthwork, produces a very destructive\r\nresult. The effect of a salvo of modern artillery, with its enormous\r\nsteel shot, against iron-plated ramparts, has never yet been tried in\r\nactual war. The concentrated fire of a ship’s broadside forms a powerful\r\nsalvo.\r\n\r\n=Samanide Dynasty.= Began with Ismail Samani, who overcame the army of\r\nthe Safferides, and established himself in the government of Persia,\r\n902; his descendants ruled till 999.\r\n\r\n=Samarcand=, or =Samarkand= (anc. _Mazacanda_). The most celebrated city\r\nof Central Asia, khanate of Bokhara, but annexed to the dominions of the\r\nczar in 1868. It is situated at the foot of Mount Chobanata, and is 145\r\nmiles nearly east by north from Bokhara. It was seized by the Arabs,\r\n707, and from this time belonged either to the califate or to some of\r\nthe dynasties which were offshoots from it, till 1219, when it was taken\r\nby Genghis Khan. In 1359 it was captured by Timour, and ten years\r\nafterward became the capital of his empire. On the division of his\r\nempire after his death, it continued the capital of Turkestan till 1468,\r\nwhen the attacks of the Uzbeks put an end to its prosperity.\r\n\r\n=Samaria.= Anciently a city of Palestine, the chief seat of the\r\nEphraimitic Baal-worship, and, from the seventh year of Omri’s reign,\r\nthe capital of the kingdom of Israel. It was twice besieged by the\r\nSyrians (901 and 892 B.C.), under Ahab and Joram, on both occasions\r\nunsuccessfully; but in 721 (720) B.C., it was stormed by Shalmaneser,\r\nking of Assyria, after a three years’ siege, and the inhabitants carried\r\noff into captivity. Their place was supplied by colonists from Babylon\r\nand other places. It was subsequently captured by Alexander the Great,\r\nwhen the “Samaritan” inhabitants were driven out, and their place\r\nsupplied by Syro-Macedonians. It was again taken (109 B.C.) by John\r\nHyrcanus, who completely destroyed it. Soon rebuilt, it remained for\r\nfifty years in possession of the Jews; but Pompey, in his victorious\r\nmarch, restored it to the descendants of the expelled Samaritans, who\r\nhad settled in the neighborhood, and it was re-fortified by Gabinius.\r\nIts name was changed to Sebaste by Herod the Great. In the 3d century it\r\nbecame a Roman colony; but its prosperity perished with the Mohammedan\r\nconquest of Palestine, and is at present only a small village called\r\nSebustieh, an Arab corruption of Sebaste.\r\n\r\n=Sambas.= A town on the west coast of Borneo. It was attacked in 1812\r\nand 1813 by the British, who were repulsed in their first attempt, but\r\nsucceeded in capturing the town at the second attack.\r\n\r\n=Sambre.= A river of French Flanders, which has been the scene of many\r\nsanguinary conflicts at different periods. It arises in the Ardennes,\r\nbetween La Capelle and Chateaux-Cambressis; runs from southwest to\r\nnortheast; washes Landrecy, a fortified town, which was taken by the\r\nImperialists in 1793. In its vicinity is Troisville, where, in 1794, the\r\nFrench were defeated by the British under the Duke of York. Maubeuge is\r\nsituated in advance of the forest of Mormal. It was fortified by Vauban,\r\nand has a manufactory of fire-arms, and a garrison of infantry and\r\ncavalry. It was vainly besieged by the allies in 1814. Near it is\r\nWattignies, where Jourdan beat the Austrians in 1813, and compelled them\r\nto raise the siege of Maubeuge. From hence the Sambre flows out of\r\nFrance, and passing into Belgium, washes Charleroi, a fortified place,\r\ncaptured by the French in 1672, 1677, 1693, 1736, 1792, and 1794. It\r\nleaves upon the heights on its right bank, Fleurus, a place rendered\r\nfamous by four remarkable battles,--that of 1622, gained by the\r\nSpaniards over the Protestants of Germany; that of 1690, gained by\r\nLuxemburg over the Imperialists; the battle of 1794, gained by Jourdan\r\nover the allies; and the battle of 1815 (also designated the battle of\r\nLigny), gained by Napoleon over the Prussians. The battle of 1794 was\r\npreceded by the siege of Charleroi, during which the French had six\r\ntimes crossed the Sambre in vain, and had been repulsed in six battles,\r\nthe most celebrated of which are those of Grandreng, of the Péchant, and\r\nof Marchienne.\r\n\r\n=Sambuque= (_Fr._) An ancient musical instrument of the wind kind,\r\nresembling a flute. It was also the name of an ancient engine of war\r\nused by Marcellus in besieging Syracuse. Plutarch relates that two ships\r\nwere required to carry it. A minute description of this engine may be\r\nseen in Polybius.\r\n\r\n=Same=, or =Samos= (anc. _Cephallenia_). A town situated on the eastern\r\ncoast, opposite Ithaca; was taken and destroyed by the Romans, 189 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Samnites.= The people of ancient Samnium, a country of Central Italy.\r\nThey were an offshoot of the Sabines, who emigrated from their country\r\nbetween the Nar and Tiber, and the Anio, before the foundation of Rome,\r\nand settled in Samnium. This country was at the time of their migration\r\ninhabited by Opicans, whom the Samnites conquered, and whose language\r\nthey adopted. The Samnites were distinguished for their bravery and love\r\nof freedom. Issuing from their mountain fastnesses, they overran a\r\ngreat part of Campania; and it was in consequence of Capua applying to\r\nthe Romans for assistance against the Samnites that war broke out\r\nbetween the two nations in 343 B.C. The Romans found the Samnites the\r\nmost warlike and formidable enemies whom they had yet encountered in\r\nItaly, and the war, which commenced in 343, was continued with few\r\ninterruptions for the space of fifty-three years. It was not until 290,\r\nwhen all their bravest troops had fallen, and their country had been\r\nrepeatedly ravaged in every direction by the Roman legions, that the\r\nSamnites sued for peace and submitted to the supremacy of Rome. They,\r\nnever, however, lost their love of freedom; and, accordingly, they not\r\nonly joined the other Italian allies in the war against Rome (90), but,\r\neven after the other allies had submitted, they still continued in arms.\r\nThe civil war between Marius and Sulla gave them hopes of recovering\r\ntheir independence; but they were defeated before the gates of Rome\r\n(82), the greater part of their troops fell in battle, and the remainder\r\nwere put to death. Their towns were laid waste, the inhabitants sold as\r\nslaves, and their place supplied by Roman colonists.\r\n\r\n=Samos.= An island on the west coast of Asia Minor, which was colonized\r\nby Ionians about 1043 B.C. Samos was taken by the Athenians, 440; and,\r\nwith Greece, became subject to Rome, 146. It was taken by the Venetians,\r\n1125; taken by the emperor Leo in the 13th century, and then\r\nsuccessively fell into the hands of the Venetians, Genoese, and Turks.\r\nAt the time of the Greek insurrection the Samians zealously embraced the\r\nside of liberty. They expelled the Turks from the island, which they put\r\ninto a state of defense, establishing an independent government. Various\r\nattempts were made by the Turks to regain the island, but they were all\r\nfoiled by the courage of the people and the vigilance of the Greek\r\nfleet. In the treaty, however, which secured the independence and\r\ndefined the limits of Greece, Samos was still left to Turkey, and the\r\nsubsequent efforts that she has made have only secured a partial\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n=San Antonio=, called also =San Antonio de Bexar=. A city of Texas,\r\nU. S., is built near the sources of the San Antonio River, 110 miles\r\nsouthwest of Austin. It is one of the oldest Spanish towns on the\r\ncontinent, and in the Texan revolution of 1836 was the scene of the\r\nmassacre of the Alamo, when a garrison of 150 men, led by Col. Travis,\r\nand including David Crockett, was surrounded by several thousand\r\nMexicans, and after a heroic resistance killed to the last man. It\r\ncontains a national arsenal.\r\n\r\n=San Jacinto.= A small village of Harris Co., Texas, on Buffalo Bayou,\r\nnear its entrance into Galveston Bay, about 18 miles east of Houston. On\r\nApril 21, 1836, the main Texan army under Gen. Houston met the\r\nMexicans, who were double their number, near San Jacinto. Furiously the\r\nTexans rushed to battle, with the cry, “Remember the Alamo!” They fought\r\nat less than half-rifle distance, and in less than half an hour wholly\r\nrouted the Mexicans, killing and wounding a number greater than the\r\nwhole Texan force. Among the prisoners taken after the battle was Santa\r\nAnna himself. The result of this battle was the undisputed independence\r\nof Texas.\r\n\r\n=San Salvador.= The smallest of the Central American republics, and\r\nconsists of a strip of territory stretching along between Honduras and\r\nthe Pacific, and bounded on the west by Guatemala, and on the east by\r\nFonseca Bay. It was conquered after a long and obstinate contest by\r\nPedro de Alvarado, a lieutenant of Cortez. In 1821 it threw off the\r\nyoke, and joined the Mexican Confederation, from which, however, it\r\nseceded in 1823. In 1863, a war broke out between San Salvador and\r\nGuatemala, in which Honduras joined the former and Nicaragua the latter.\r\nThe result was the defeat of San Salvador.\r\n\r\n=San Sebastian.= A seaport of Spain, capital of Guipuzcoa, one of the\r\nBasque provinces, on the shore of the Bay of Biscay, 42 miles\r\nnorth-northwest of Pampeluna. From its position and strength, it has\r\nlong been a place of much importance, and has sustained several sieges.\r\nThe most memorable of these was in 1813, when the British under\r\nWellington took it by storm.\r\n\r\n=San Severo.= A town of Naples, capital of a district in the province of\r\nCapitanata. The inhabitants in 1799 made a gallant but vain resistance\r\nto the French under Duhesme, in revenge for which an indiscriminate\r\nslaughter was begun, and the town was only saved from total destruction\r\nby the heroism of the women, who threw themselves between the victorious\r\nsoldiery and their victims.\r\n\r\n=Sandhurst Military College.= See MILITARY ACADEMIES (GREAT BRITAIN).\r\n\r\n=Sangiac.= A situation or appointment of dignity in Turkey. The sangiacs\r\nare governors of towns or cantons, and take rank immediately after the\r\n_beglerbegs_. (See BEG.) The name is also applied to the banner which he\r\nis authorized to display, and has been mistaken for Saint Jacques.\r\n\r\n=Sanjak.= A Turkish word signifying “a standard,” is employed to denote\r\na subdivision of an _eyalet_, because the ruler of such a subdivision,\r\ncalled _sanjak-beg_, is entitled to carry in war a standard of one\r\nhorse-tail. The sanjak is frequently called _liva_, and its ruler a\r\n_mirmiram_.\r\n\r\n=Sanjak-Sherif.= See FLAG OF THE PROPHET.\r\n\r\n=Sansculottes= (_i.e._, “without breeches”). Was the name given in\r\nscorn, at the beginning of the French revolution, by the court party to\r\nthe democratic “proletaires” of Paris. The latter accepted this\r\nsuperfine reproach with sardonic pride, and the term soon became the\r\ndistinctive appellation of a “good patriot,” more especially as such a\r\none often made a point of showing his contempt for the rich by\r\nneglecting his apparel, and cultivating rough and cynical manners.\r\nToward the close of the Convention, the name, connected as it had been\r\nwith all the sanguinary excesses of the period, naturally fell into bad\r\nodor, and soon after totally disappeared.\r\n\r\n=Santa Fé.= City and capital of the Territory of New Mexico, built among\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, on a plain 7047 feet above the sea. It is an old\r\nSpanish Mexican town, about 20 miles east of the Rio Grande del Norte.\r\nThe Spaniards were driven out of Santa Fé in 1680 by the Pueblo Indians;\r\nbut it was recaptured by the former in 1694, and held by them till the\r\noccupation by Americans in 1846. It was occupied by the Confederates for\r\nseveral days in 1862.\r\n\r\n=Santiago de Compostella.= An important and once famous city of Spain,\r\nformerly the capital of Galicia. It was sacked by the Moors in 995, and\r\nheld by them till it was taken by Ferdinand III. in 1235. It was taken\r\nby the French in 1809, and held till 1814.\r\n\r\n=Sap.= In military engineering, is a narrow ditch or trench, by which\r\napproach is made from the foremost parallel towards the glacis or covert\r\nway of a besieged place. The sap is usually made by four sappers, the\r\nleading man of whom rolls a large gabion before him, and excavates as he\r\nprogresses, filling smaller gabions with the earth dug out, and erecting\r\nthem on one or both sides to form a parapet. The other sappers widen and\r\ndeepen the sap, throwing more earth on to the parapet. A sap is\r\nconsidered to advance in average ground about 8 feet per hour. From the\r\nnearness of the enemy’s works, running a sap is an extremely dangerous\r\noperation. When possible, therefore, it is carried on at night; in any\r\ncase, the sappers are relieved at least every hour. When a sap is\r\nenlarged to the dimensions of a trench, it bears that name. When the\r\nfire of the enemy is slack, so that many gabions may be placed and\r\nfilled at the same time, it is called a _flying sap_. If two parapets,\r\none on each side of the trench, be formed, it is then called a _double\r\nsap_.\r\n\r\n=Sap.= To pierce with saps; to execute saps. Also, to proceed by mining\r\nor secretly undermining.\r\n\r\n=Sap-fagots.= Are fascines 3 feet long, placed vertically between two\r\ngabions, for the protection of the sappers before the parapet is thrown\r\nover.\r\n\r\n=Sappers and Miners.= Are soldiers belonging to the engineer corps, and\r\nnow called engineers, whose business it is to make gabions, fascines,\r\nhurdles, etc., to trace lines and trenches, to drive the various kinds\r\nof saps, to descend into and pass the ditch, to destroy the enemy’s\r\nobstacles, to drain the trenches, to put up the various kinds of\r\nrevetments, to post and superintend working parties, and to serve in\r\nthe mines when required. They are also taught to adjust and sod the\r\nslopes, to erect palisades, fraises, etc., and to repair the defenses of\r\na place, as also to erect bridges, and throw pontons over rivers, to\r\nplant torpedoes, and in fact to perform all the duties appertaining to\r\nengineer soldiers. In marching near an enemy, every column should have\r\nwith its advance-guard a detachment of sappers, furnished with tools to\r\nopen the way or repair the road. Bonaparte considered the proper\r\nproportion of engineer soldiers to an army to be 1 : 40; but now in\r\nFrance it is 1 : 33; in England 1 : 34; in Prussia 1 : 36; and in the\r\nUnited States 1 : 60.\r\n\r\n=Sapping.= The art of excavating trenches of approach, under the\r\nmusketry-fire of the besieged.\r\n\r\n=Sap-roller.= Consists of two large concentric gabions, 6 feet in\r\nlength, the outer one having a diameter of 4 feet, the inner one a\r\ndiameter of 2 feet 8 inches, the space between them being stuffed with\r\npickets or small billets of hard wood, to make them musket-shot proof.\r\nIts use is to protect the squad of sappers in their approach from the\r\nfire of the place.\r\n\r\n=Saracens.= A name variously employed by mediæval writers to designate\r\nthe Mohammedans of Syria and Palestine, the Arabs generally, or the\r\nArab-Berber races of Northern Africa, who conquered Spain and Sicily,\r\nand invaded France. At a later date it was employed as a synonym for all\r\ninfidel nations against which crusades were preached, and was thus\r\napplied to the Seljuks of Iconium, the Turks, and even to the pagan\r\nPrussians.\r\n\r\n=Saracen’s Head.= A not unfrequent bearing in heraldry. It is\r\nrepresented as the head of an old man with a savage countenance.\r\n\r\n=Saragossa=, or =Zaragoza=. A city of Spain, the capital of a province\r\nof the same name, and formerly of the kingdom of Aragon. It is situated\r\non the Ebro, which divides the city into two parts. It was a place of\r\nimportance under the Romans, but there are few remains of the Roman\r\ncity. It was taken by the Moors in the 8th century, and recovered from\r\nthem in 1118, after a siege of five years, during which a great part of\r\nthe inhabitants died of hunger. It was taken by the French in 1809,\r\nafter a siege of eight months, and one of the most heroic defenses\r\nrecorded in the history of modern warfare.\r\n\r\n=Saratoga.= A township of Saratoga Co., N. Y., situated on the Hudson,\r\n28 miles north from Albany. It is remarkable in American history as the\r\nplace where Burgoyne surrendered to the Americans in 1777. From\r\nSeptember 19 to October 7 frequent animated skirmishes occurred between\r\nthe British and the Americans, but on the latter date the battle of\r\nSaratoga began. Gen. Gates drew up his army on the brow of a hill, near\r\nthe river, his camp being in the segment of a large circle, the convex\r\nside towards the enemy. Gen. Burgoyne’s troops were drawn up with his\r\nleft resting on the river, his right extending at right angles to it\r\nacross the low grounds, about 200 yards, to a range of steep heights.\r\nThe Americans attacked the British along their whole line, when the\r\naction became general. The efforts of the combatants were desperate.\r\nBurgoyne and his officers fought like men who were defending, at the\r\nlast cast, their military reputation; Gates and his army like those who\r\nwere deciding whether themselves and their children should be freedmen\r\nor slaves. The invading army gave way in the short space of fifty-two\r\nminutes. The defenders of the soil followed them to their intrenchments,\r\nforced the guard and killed its commander. The works of the British were\r\nstormed, but darkness coming on, the Americans desisted, and rested on\r\ntheir arms upon the field which they had so bravely won, determined to\r\npursue their victory with returning light. But Burgoyne, aware of the\r\nadvantage which the Americans had gained, effected with admirable order\r\na change of his ground. His entire camp was removed before morning to\r\nthe heights. Gates was too wise to attack his enemy in his new position,\r\nbut made arrangements to inclose them, which Burgoyne perceiving, put\r\nhis army in motion at 9 o’clock at night and removed to Saratoga, 6\r\nmiles up the river, abandoning his sick and wounded to the humanity of\r\nthe Americans. Burgoyne now made several efforts to effect a retreat;\r\nbut in every way he had been anticipated. He found himself in a foreign\r\nand hostile country, hemmed in by a foe whose army, constantly\r\nincreasing, already amounted to four times his own wasted numbers. His\r\nboats laden with supplies were taken, and his provisions were failing,\r\nand when he found he could not hold out any longer, his troops being in\r\nthe utmost distress, he surrendered on October 17. The whole number\r\nsurrendered amounted to 5752 men, which, together with the troops lost\r\nbefore by various disasters, made up the whole British loss to 9213 men.\r\nThere also fell into the hands of the Americans 35 field-pieces and 5000\r\nmuskets. It was stipulated that the British should pile their arms at\r\nthe word of command, given by their own officers, march out of their\r\ncamp with the honors of war, and have free passage across the Atlantic;\r\nthey, on their part, agreeing not to serve again in North America during\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n=Sarawak.= A town and province of Borneo, on the northeast coast of the\r\nisland. The Chinese inhabitants of this place rose in insurrection and\r\nmassacred a number of Europeans, February 17 and 18, 1857; the rajah,\r\nSir J. Brooke, raised a force and speedily chastised the insurgents, of\r\nwhom 2000 were killed.\r\n\r\n=Sarbacane= (_Fr._). A blow-pipe, or long tube of wood or metal, through\r\nwhich poisoned arrows were shot by blowing with the mouth.\r\n\r\n=Sarceled.= In heraldry, cut through the middle.\r\n\r\n=Sardar.= In the East Indies, a chief or leader is so called.\r\n\r\n=Sardinia.= A former kingdom in the south of Europe, composed of the\r\nisland of Sardinia, Piedmont, Savoy, and the territories of Genoa and\r\nNice. It takes its name from the island of Sardinia, and was, in 1860,\r\nmerged in the new kingdom of Italy. From 1798 to 1814 the continental\r\npart of Sardinia formed a portion of the French empire. In 1848, Charles\r\nAlbert, the reigning monarch, encouraged the inhabitants of the\r\nLombardo-Venetian kingdom, or Austrian Italy, in their attempts to throw\r\noff the Austrian yoke, and marched to their assistance, when they broke\r\ninto open revolt. He gained many victories at first over the Austrians,\r\nbut he was subsequently defeated by Radetzky, and resigned his crown to\r\nhis son, Victor Emmanuel. In 1855 Sardinia took part with Britain and\r\nFrance against Russia. In 1859 a war broke out between Austria on the\r\none hand, and France and Sardinia on the other, which resulted in the\r\ndefeat of the Austrians and the annexation of Lombardy to the Sardinian\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n=Sardinia, Island of.= The largest after Sicily, of the islands of the\r\nMediterranean, lies directly south of Corsica, from which it is\r\nseparated by the Strait of Bonefacio. It was called Sardo by the Romans,\r\nand was colonized at a very early period. The first really historical\r\nevent is its conquest, about 480 B.C., by the Carthaginians. They were\r\nforced to abandon it to the Romans (238 B.C.), who gradually subdued the\r\nrebellious natives, and made it a province of the republic; but on three\r\nseveral occasions, formidable outbreaks required the presence of a\r\nconsul with a large army to restore the authority of Rome. It fell into\r\nthe hands of the Vandals and other barbarians, and was recovered by the\r\nEastern empire in 534, but was finally separated from the Roman empire\r\nby the Saracens. They were driven out in their turn by the Pisans. Pope\r\nBoniface took upon him to transfer it to the king of Aragon, who subdued\r\nthe Genoese, Pisans, and the rest of the inhabitants, and annexed it to\r\nhis own dominions in 1324. It remained united to the crown of Spain till\r\nthe allies made a conquest of it in 1708. It was allotted to the emperor\r\nof Germany at the peace of Utrecht, in 1713. The Spaniards recovered it\r\nin 1717, but were obliged to abandon it two years after, when it was\r\nconferred on the duke of Savoy in lieu of the kingdom of Sicily, in\r\n1720. From 1798 to 1814 it was the only portion of the Sardinian\r\ndominions left in the power of its sovereign, the French occupying the\r\nother portion of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n=Sardis=, or =Sardes=. Anciently the capital of Lydia, in Asia Minor,\r\nstood at the foot of Mount Tmolus, now called Bozdag, about 50 miles\r\nnortheast from Smyrna; the citadel on a steep rock was almost\r\nimpregnable, being fortified by three walls. It was thus enabled to hold\r\nout when the lower town was taken by the Cimmerians in the reign of\r\nArdys. During the Ionian revolt, 501 B.C., the insurgents, aided by the\r\nAthenians, took the city. It was taken by the Turks in the 11th century,\r\nand suffered a severe blow from Tamerlane, who almost entirely destroyed\r\nit about 200 years later.\r\n\r\n=Sarmatia.= The ancient name of the country in Asia and Europe, between\r\nthe Caspian Sea and the Vistula, including Russia and Poland. The\r\nSarmatæ, or Sauromatæ, troubled the early Roman empire by incursions;\r\nafter subduing the Scythians, they were subjugated by the Goths in the\r\n3d and 4th centuries. They joined the Huns and other barbarians in\r\ninvading Western Europe in the 5th century.\r\n\r\n=Sarno.= A city of Southern Italy, in the province of Principato Citra,\r\non the river of the same name, 13 miles northwest of Salerno. In the\r\nplain near Sarno, Teias, king of the Goths, in a desperate battle with\r\nthe Greeks, commanded by Narses, in 553, was vanquished and slain, and\r\nthe reign of the Goths in Italy brought to a close.\r\n\r\n=Sarrazine.= A rough portcullis.\r\n\r\n=Sarre= (_Fr._). When artillery was first invented, this name was given\r\nto a long gun, of smaller dimensions than the _bombarde_.\r\n\r\n=Sasbach.= A village of Baden, 28 miles southwest from Carlsruhe.\r\nMarshal Turenne was killed here by a random shot in 1675.\r\n\r\n=Sash.= In the British army, is a military distinction worn on duty or\r\nparade by officers and non-commissioned officers. For the former, it is\r\nof crimson silk; for the latter, of crimson cotton. It is tied on the\r\nright side by the cavalry, and on the left side by the infantry. In\r\nHighland regiments, the sash is worn over the left shoulder and across\r\nthe body. The sashes for the Austrian army are of crimson and gold; the\r\nPrussian army, black silk and silver; the Hanoverian wears yellow silk;\r\nthe Portuguese, crimson silk, with blue tassels; the French have their\r\nsashes made of three colors,--white, pink, and light blue,--to\r\ncorrespond with the national flag. In the U. S. army, all general\r\nofficers above the rank of brigadier-general may wear a sash of buff\r\nsilk and gold-thread worn across the body; and for brigadier-generals,\r\nsashes of buff silk net, with silk bullion fringe ends, are worn around\r\nthe waist.\r\n\r\n=Sassanidæ.= A famous dynasty of Persia, which reigned from 226 to 651.\r\nThey were the descendants of Artaxerxes or Ardishir, whose father,\r\nBabek, was the son of Sassan. Ardishir revolted against Artabanus, king\r\nof Parthia, and defeated him on the plain of Hormuz, 226, and\r\nre-established the Persian monarchy. The Roman armies could make no\r\nimpression on the Persians under the Sassanidæ; but from time to time\r\nhad to return defeated and humiliated from the Persian frontiers. Their\r\nlast monarch, Yezdejerd, was defeated and the dynasty expelled in 652.\r\n\r\n=Satellites.= Were certain armed men, of whom mention is made in the\r\nhistory of Philip Augustus, king of France. The satellites of Philip\r\nAugustus were men selected from the militia of the country, who fought\r\non foot and horseback. The servants or batmen who attended the military\r\nknights when they went into action were likewise called satellites, and\r\nfought in their defense mounted or on foot.\r\n\r\n=Sattara.= A town and capital of the province of the same name, in\r\nBritish India, in the Presidency of Bombay. In 1700 its fort offered a\r\nvigorous resistance for two months to Aurungzebe, who besieged it in\r\nperson, but it was reduced by blockade; and in 1818 a few bomb-shells\r\nprocured its surrender to the British.\r\n\r\n=Saturn.= In heraldry, the black color in blazoning arms; sable.\r\n\r\n=Saucisson=, or =Sausage=. Is a fascine of more than the usual length;\r\nbut the principal application of the term is to the apparatus for firing\r\na military mine. This consists of a long bag or pipe of linen, cloth, or\r\nleather, from 1 inch to 1¹⁄₂ inch in diameter, and charged with\r\ngunpowder. One end is laid in the mine to be exploded; the other is\r\nconducted to the galleries to a place where the engineers can fire in\r\nsafety. The electric spark is now preferred to the saucisson.\r\n\r\n=Saumur.= A town of France, in the department of Maine-et-Loire, 28\r\nmiles southeast of Angers. A striking event in the history of the town\r\nwas its brilliant capture by Larochejaquelein and the Vendeans, June 10,\r\n1793. In this action, the victors, with but a slight loss, captured 60\r\ncannon, 10,000 muskets, and 11,000 republicans; it was a stronghold of\r\nthe Protestants during the reign of Henry IV.\r\n\r\n=Savages=, or =Wild Men=. In heraldry, are of frequent occurrence as\r\nsupporters. They are represented naked, and also, particularly in the\r\nlater heraldry, are usually wreathed about the head and middle with\r\nlaurel, and often furnished with a club in the exterior hand. Savages\r\nare especially prevalent in the heraldry of Scotland. In more than one\r\nof the Douglas seals of the first half of the 15th century, the shield\r\nis borne in one hand by a single savage, who acts as sole supporter.\r\n\r\n=Savan Droog=, or =Savendroog=. A strong hill fort of India, in the\r\nterritory of Mysore, 19 miles west from Bangalore. It was stormed by the\r\nBritish in 1791; and after the fall of Tippoo Sahib in 1799, it was\r\ngarrisoned by a native force.\r\n\r\n=Savannah.= A city and port of Georgia, U. S., on the right bank of the\r\nSavannah River, 18 miles from its mouth. The city is surrounded by\r\nmarshes and islands, and was defended by Fort Pulaski and Fort Jackson.\r\nSavannah was founded in 1733, by the English general Oglethorpe. In 1776\r\na British fleet, attempting to take the town, was repulsed after a\r\nsevere action; but it was taken in 1778, and held in 1779 against the\r\ncombined French and American forces. In the war of Secession, after many\r\nunsuccessful attacks by sea, it was taken by Gen. Sherman in February,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n=Saverne= (anc. _Taberna_). A town of France, in the department of\r\nBas-Rhin, on the Zorn, 19 miles northwest of Strasburg. It is a very\r\nancient place, and was formerly fortified. It suffered very much during\r\nthe Thirty Years’ War; and its fortifications were destroyed in 1696.\r\n\r\n=Savigliano.= A fortified town of Northern Italy, in Piedmont, 28 miles\r\nsouth from Turin. The French defeated the Austrians here in 1799.\r\n\r\n=Savona.= A maritime city of Northern Italy, in the province of Genoa,\r\nand 25 miles southwest from the city of that name. It is a very ancient\r\ncity, and in the time of the Romans was called Sava; was destroyed by\r\nRotharis (639), rebuilt by Ludovic the Pious (981), and was afterwards\r\nlaid waste by the Saracens.\r\n\r\n=Savoy.= Formerly a province in Northern Italy, east of Piedmont. It\r\nbecame a Roman province about 118 B.C. The Alemanni seized it in 395,\r\nand the Franks in 490. It shared the revolutions of Switzerland till\r\nabout 1048. The French subdued Savoy in 1792, and made it a department\r\nof France under the name of Mont Blanc in 1800; it was restored to the\r\nking of Sardinia in 1814; but was once more annexed to France in 1860.\r\n\r\n=Sawunt Warree.= A native state of India, in the Presidency of Bombay.\r\nThe first treaty between Sawunt Warree and the British took place in\r\n1730, and had for its object to suppress the piracies of the Angria\r\nfamily in the island of Kolabah. But the chieftains of Sawunt Warree,\r\nbeing themselves addicted to piracy, drew upon them the hostility of the\r\nBritish in 1765. A series of wars, treaties, and negotiations ensued,\r\nwhich ended in the subjugation of the state in 1819 by a British force.\r\nThe sea-coast was then ceded to the British, and the native government\r\nrestored. Rebellions were raised against the chiefs in 1828, 1832, and\r\n1838. The most important event that has since occurred, was the\r\ndangerous rebellion which began in the autumn of 1844, and was put down\r\nafter some months of hard fighting by Lieut.-Col. Outram in the\r\nbeginning of the following year.\r\n\r\n=Sawyer Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Saxons.= A German people whose name is usually derived from an old\r\nGerman word, _sahs_, “a knife,” and are first mentioned by Ptolemy, who\r\nmakes them inhabit a district south of the Cimbrian Peninsula. They are\r\nmentioned as brave and skillful sailors who often joined the Chauci in\r\npiratical expeditions against the coast of Gaul. In the 3d century they\r\nappear in England under Carausius, a Belgic admiral in the Roman\r\nservice, who made himself “Augustus” in Britain by their help. They had\r\nfirmly rooted themselves, at the beginning of the 5th century, in the\r\npresent Normandy, and they fought against Attila in the Catalaunian\r\nPlain, 451. They also obtained a footing at the mouth of the Loire; but\r\nall the Saxons who settled in France disappeared before the Franks, or\r\nwere probably incorporated with their more powerful kinsmen of Southern\r\nGermany. Along with the Franks, they destroyed the kingdom of the\r\nThuringians in 531, and obtained possession of the land between the Harz\r\nand the Unstrut; but this district was in turn forced to acknowledge the\r\nFrankish sovereignty. From 719, wars between the Saxons and the Franks\r\nbecame constant; but the latter, after 772, were generally successful,\r\nin spite of the vigorous resistance offered by Wittekind, and in 804,\r\nthe Saxons were finally subjugated by the arms of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n=Saxony, Kingdom of.= The second in importance and population of the\r\nminor German states, and a state of the new German empire. The earliest\r\ninhabitants of Upper Saxony, since the Christian era, were the\r\nHermunduri; in the beginning of the 6th century their settlements were\r\ntaken possession of by the Sorbs, a Slavic race. The Carlovingian\r\nrulers, dissatisfied with the ingress of those non-German tribes,\r\nerected “marks” to bar their progress; and Duke Otho the Illustrious of\r\nSaxony, and his celebrated son, Henry the Fowler, warred against them,\r\nthe latter--subduing the Heveller, the Daleminzer, and the\r\nMiltzer--founded in their country the marks of Brandenburg Misnia\r\n(Meissen), and Lusatia (Lausitz), and planted colonies of Germans among\r\nthe Sorbs. In 1090 the mark was bestowed on the house of Wettin, and was\r\nconfirmed as a hereditary possession to that family in 1127. Frederick\r\nthe Warlike (1381-1428) succeeded in uniting the severed portions of\r\nSaxony, to which were added various districts in Franconia, and in 1423\r\nthe electorate of Saxony. The Saxon elector was now one of the most\r\npowerful princes of Germany, but unfortunately the fatal practice of\r\nsubdividing the father’s territories among his sons still continued; and\r\nduring the reign of the elector, Frederick the Mild (1428-1464), a civil\r\nwar broke out and was carried on for years. By a separate treaty of\r\npeace (1635), John George I. obtained Upper and Lower Lusatia,\r\nacquisitions confirmed by the treaty of Westphalia (1648). The reign of\r\nFrederick Augustus I. (1694-1733) well-nigh ruined the hitherto\r\nprosperous electorate. Frederick Augustus had been chosen king of\r\nPoland; and his attempt, in company with the czar and the king of\r\nDenmark, to dismember Sweden, brought down upon him and his two states\r\nthe vengeance of the northern “fire-king.” Poland was utterly\r\ndevastated, and Saxony exhausted in money and troops; the king was\r\nforced to sell many important portions of territory; Frederick Augustus\r\nII. (1733-1763), also king of Poland, took part in the war of the\r\nAustrian Succession against Maria Theresa, but finding the treaty of\r\nBerlin (1742) not so satisfactory for himself as he expected, he joined\r\nthe empress in 1745. The country was atrociously ravaged during the\r\nSeven Years’ War, and a long time elapsed before it recovered its\r\nprevious peaceful and prosperous state. In the conflict of 1866 the king\r\nof Saxony took the side of Austria, and his army fought in the battle of\r\nKöniggratz, July 3. The Prussians entered Saxony June 18. Peace between\r\nPrussia and Saxony was signed October 21 (subjecting the Saxon army to\r\nPrussia), and the king returned to Dresden November 3. In 1870-71 the\r\nSaxon soldiers fought under the leadership of the crown-prince,\r\nafterward King Albert, as true allies by the side of the Prussians, and\r\nthe interior development of the country has not only kept pace with, but\r\nin some respects even advanced beyond, that of the rest of Northern\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n=Scabbard.= Is the sheath for a sword or bayonet, at once to render the\r\nweapon harmless and to protect it from damp. It was usually made of\r\nblack leather, tipped, mouthed, and ringed with metal, but is now\r\ngenerally made of bronzed steel. The cavalry wear scabbards of polished\r\nsteel. These better sustain the friction against the horses’\r\naccoutrements, but are objectionable from their noisiness, and the\r\nconsequent impossibility of surprising an enemy. The sword-scabbard is\r\nsuspended to the belt by two rings; the bayonet-scabbard hooks into a\r\nfrog in connection with the waist-belt.\r\n\r\n=Scalade= (from the Fr. _escalade_). A furious attack upon a wall or\r\nrampart, contrary to form, and with no regularity, frequently carried on\r\nwith ladders, to insult the wall by open force.\r\n\r\n=Scale.= To climb by a ladder, or as if by a ladder; to clamber up; as,\r\nto scale the ramparts.\r\n\r\n=Scale-armor.= Consisted of small plates of steel riveted together in a\r\nmanner resembling the scales of a fish. From the small size of the\r\nplates, it possessed considerable pliability, and was therefore a\r\nfavorite protection for the neck, in the form of a curtain hanging from\r\nthe helmet. Scale-armor is now obsolete, except, perhaps, among some\r\nEastern potentates.\r\n\r\n=Scaling.= Scaling a piece of artillery, is the flashing off of a small\r\nquantity of powder to clean out the bore; about one-twelfth of the\r\nshot’s weight. The practice is discontinued.\r\n\r\n=Scaling-ladders= (Fr. _echelles de siege_). Are ladders used in scaling\r\nwhen a place is to be taken by surprise. They are made several ways;\r\nsometimes of flat staves, so as to move about their pins, and shut like\r\na parallel ruler, for conveniently carrying them.\r\n\r\n=Scamper.= To run away precipitately; said of troops.\r\n\r\n=Scandinavia.= The ancient name of Sweden, Norway, and a great part of\r\nDenmark, whence proceeded the Northmen, or Normans, who conquered\r\nNormandy (about 900), and eventually England (1066). See NORMANS.\r\n\r\n=Scarf.= In heraldry, a small ecclesiastical banner suspended from the\r\ntop of a crozier.\r\n\r\n=Scarp, To.= To cut down a slope so as to render it inaccessible. See\r\nCOUNTERSCARP, and ESCARP.\r\n\r\n=Scarpe.= In heraldry, a diminutive of the bend sinister, being half the\r\nbreadth of that ordinary.\r\n\r\n=Sceptre.= Originally a staff or walking-stick, hence in course of time,\r\nalso a weapon of assault and of defense. At a very early period the\r\nprivilege of carrying it came to be connected with the idea of authority\r\nand station. The sceptre of the kings of Rome, which was afterwards\r\nborne by the consuls, was of ivory, and surmounted by an eagle. Since\r\nthat time there has been considerable variety in its form. The English\r\nsceptre now in use dates from Charles II.’s time, and is cruciform.\r\n\r\n=Schaife.= In the Middle Ages, a quiver or bundle of arrows was so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n=Schellenberg.= A village in the southeast of Upper Bavaria, 6 miles\r\nsouthwest from the Austrian town of Salzburg, near which occurred the\r\nfirst battle of the War of the Spanish Succession, in which the English\r\ntook part. Maximilian Emmanuel, elector of Bavaria, had fortified the\r\nhill of Schellenberg to resist the progress of Marlborough; but on July\r\n4, 1704, the work was attacked by the English, led on by Prince Ludwig,\r\nof Baden, and carried by storm after a bloody fight.\r\n\r\n=Schenkle Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Schierling.= A town of Germany, in Bavaria, 12 miles south from\r\nRatisbon. The Austrians were defeated by the French in its vicinity in\r\n1809.\r\n\r\n=Schleswig=, or =Sleswick=. Formerly a duchy of Denmark. Its history is\r\nidentical with that of Holstein (which see).\r\n\r\n=Schliengen.= A town of Baden, 22 miles southwest from Mulheim. The\r\nArchduke Charles of Austria defeated the French near this place in 1796.\r\n\r\n=Schmalkald, League of.= The name given to the defensive alliance\r\nconcluded provisionally for nine years at Schmalkalden, February 27,\r\n1531, between nine Protestant princes and eleven imperial cities, with\r\nwhom other five princes and ten imperial cities subsequently made common\r\ncause; and the elector of Saxony and the landgrave of Hesse were\r\nappointed chiefs of the league, and empowered to manage its affairs. The\r\nobject of this formidable alliance, which included the whole of Northern\r\nGermany, Denmark, Saxony, and Würtemberg, and portions of Bavaria and\r\nSwitzerland, was for the common defense of the religious and political\r\nfreedom of the Protestants against the emperor Charles V. and the\r\nCatholic states. The league was not rendered superfluous by the\r\nreligious peace of Nürnberg in 1532, and on the rumor that the emperor\r\nwas meditating new hostile measures against the Protestants, another\r\nmeeting of the confederates was held December 24, 1535, which resolved\r\nto raise a permanent army of 10,000 foot and 2000 cavalry, and to\r\nprolong the league for ten years. The confederation was further\r\nconsolidated by articles of guarantee, which were drawn up by Luther at\r\nWittenberg in 1536, and being subscribed by the theologians present at\r\nthe meeting of the league at Schmalkalden in February, 1537, were called\r\nthe _Articles of Schmalkald_. Against the league the emperor, engaged as\r\nhe was at the time in contests with the Turks and French, found himself\r\nunable to contend, though supported by the Holy League, a Catholic\r\nconfederation formed in 1538, in opposition to the Protestant one. But\r\nimpolitic management, mutual jealousies, and conflicting petty interests\r\ndissipated their energies, and prevented united action. The “War of\r\nSchmalkald” commenced by the advance of the army of the league, under\r\nSebastian Schartlin, in Suabia, to bar the approach of the imperial army\r\nfrom Italy. Schartlin forced his way to the banks of the Danube, but the\r\nmiserable jealousy of the Saxon princes paralyzed his action. The\r\nemperor, by a proclamation bearing date July 20, 1546, put the two\r\nchiefs of the league under the ban of the empire; Maurice, duke of\r\nSaxony, took possession of the electorate, by virtue of an imperial\r\ndecree; and the Protestant army was forced to retreat. The elector of\r\nSaxony reconquered his electorate in the autumn of 1546, but meantime\r\nthe imperial army subdued the northern members of the League of\r\nSchmalkald and advanced into Franconia to meet the combined armies of\r\nSaxony and Hesse. The latter were totally routed at Mühlberg, April 24,\r\n1547, and both chiefs fell into the emperor’s hands. This defeat, which\r\nhas been ascribed to treason, and was perhaps as much owing to this\r\ncause as to weakness, finished the war. The object of the league, the\r\nguarantee of the liberty of religion to the Protestants, was\r\nsubsequently effected by Maurice, now elector of Saxony, who, by a\r\nbrilliant feat of diplomacy and generalship, compelled the emperor to\r\ngrant the treaty of Passau, July 31, 1552, by which this freedom was\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n=Schoolmaster, Army.= In the English army, the schoolmaster is a\r\nnon-commissioned officer of the first class, ranking next to a\r\nsergeant-major. His pay varies with length of service. He has an\r\nadvantage over other non-commissioned officers in quarters and certain\r\nallowances. To become an army schoolmaster, it is necessary either to be\r\na certificated schoolmaster, or to have served the apprenticeship as a\r\npupil-teacher, and to pass through a course of training for one year at\r\nthe Royal Military Asylum, Chelsea. After the completion of the\r\ntraining, the candidate is required to enlist as a common soldier for\r\nten years’ general service, whereupon he is immediately promoted to the\r\nrank of schoolmaster. A few of the most deserving schoolmasters are\r\npromoted to be superintending schoolmasters, when they rank as ensigns.\r\nThe duties of the schoolmaster are to teach the soldiers and their\r\nchildren the rudiments of general knowledge, to examine the girls’\r\nschool, and to deliver lectures to the soldiers. There were in 1865 214\r\narmy schoolmasters in the British service.\r\n\r\n=Schoolmistress, Army.= In the British service, is a person attached to\r\neach regiment or corps for the purpose of instructing the daughters of\r\nsoldiers and their sons, under eight years old, in the rudiments of\r\nEnglish and in plain needle-work. She must be a certified\r\nschoolmistress, or a pupil-teacher who has served her apprenticeship.\r\nAfter admission to the service, she is specially trained for six months\r\nat one of four training institutions. This training is at the expense of\r\nthe government. Proper provision is made for the quarters and supplies\r\nof the schoolmistress, whose somewhat anomalous position among rough men\r\ncalls for the most circumspect behavior on her part.\r\n\r\n=Schools of Artillery.= See ARTILLERY, SCHOOLS OF.\r\n\r\n=Schultz’s Powder.= A powder for fire-arms invented by Capt. Schultz of\r\nthe Prussian army, sometimes called _white gunpowder_, though this term\r\nis also applied to other powder. It is made by treating grains of wood\r\nwith a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, by means of which a low\r\nform of nitro-cellulose is produced. The explosive power is heightened\r\nby steeping the prepared grains in a solution of nitre. _Dittman’s\r\nsporting powder_, manufactured in America, is believed to be a similar\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n=Schumla=, =Shoomla=, or =Shumla=. A large fortified town of Turkey in\r\nEurope, in the province of Bulgaria, about 58 miles southwest from\r\nSilistria. The Russians have made several unsuccessful attempts to take\r\nit in their different wars with Turkey.\r\n\r\n=Schuwalow Gun= (_Fr._). A gun named after the inventor, a Russian\r\ngeneral. It differed from a common gun in having an oval bore; the\r\ngreater diameter lay in a horizontal direction; it had also a long\r\ncylindrical chamber.\r\n\r\n=Schweidnitz.= A town of Prussian Silesia, on the left bank of the\r\nWeistritz, 42 miles southeast of Liegnitz. It is in part fortified, and\r\nwas besieged and taken four times within fifty years, the last time by\r\nthe French in 1807, when the defenses were in great part destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Schwytz.= One of the cantons of Switzerland. It was one of the three\r\noriginal cantons that formed the Confederation in 1308 against the\r\nAustrian power; and from its name the modern appellation of the entire\r\ncountry has been derived.\r\n\r\n=Sciathus= (now _Skiatho_). A small island in the Ægean Sea, east of the\r\nMagnesian coast of Thessaly. It is frequently mentioned in the history\r\nof the invasion of Greece by Xerxes. It subsequently became one of the\r\nsubject allies of Athens. Its chief town was destroyed by the last\r\nPhilip of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n=Science, Military.= See LOGISTICS, STRATAGEM, STRATEGY, TACTICS, and\r\nWAR.\r\n\r\n=Scillus.= A town of Elis, on the river Selinus, south of Olympia. It\r\nwas destroyed by the Eleans in the war which they carried on against the\r\nPisæans, whose cause had been espoused by the inhabitants of Scillus.\r\nThe Lacedæmonians subsequently took possession of the territory of\r\nScillus; they gave it to Xenophon after his banishment from Athens.\r\n\r\n=Scimeter.= See CIMETER.\r\n\r\n=Scio=, =Chio=, or =Khio= (anc. _Chios_). An island belonging to Asiatic\r\nTurkey, lying in the Grecian Archipelago, off the coast of Asia Minor.\r\nChios became a member of the Ionian confederation of twelve states on\r\nthe Asiatic islands and coast. Its insular position protected it against\r\nthe Lydian, and for a time against the Persian power. But in the Ionian\r\nrevolt the Chians lent their assistance to their fellow-countrymen by\r\nfurnishing ships to the fleet, which was totally defeated by the\r\nPersians off Miletus, 494 B.C. The conquerors in consequence landed on\r\nthe island, and ravaged it with fire and sword. The battle of Mycale, in\r\n479, liberated Chios from the Persian yoke, but only to become a\r\ndependency of Athens. To this power it remained faithful till after the\r\noutbreak of the Peloponnesian war; but as that disastrous contest\r\nproceeded, and the fortune of war began to prove adverse to Athens, the\r\nChians attempted to assert their liberty. They suffered several defeats\r\nfrom the Athenians, who laid waste the island, but could not conquer the\r\ncapital. At a later period Chios was again subject to Athens, and again\r\nrevolted, and seems to have maintained its independence for some time.\r\nIt gave assistance to the Romans in their war with Antiochus, 190 B.C.;\r\nand afterwards, when allied with Mithridates, that monarch, suspecting\r\nthe people of a bearing towards the Romans, sent a lieutenant, who\r\ncarried the inhabitants away from the island, 86 B.C. They were restored\r\nby the Romans; and, in consideration of this calamity, the island was\r\nmade a free state and an ally of Rome. Early in the 14th century, the\r\nTurks conquered the capital, and perpetrated a general massacre of its\r\ninhabitants; but from 1346 to 1566 Scio was held by the Genoese. In the\r\nlatter year it was conquered by Solyman the Magnificent; and since that\r\ntime, with the exception of a short period when the Venetians possessed\r\nit, the island has belonged to the Ottoman empire. In 1822, during the\r\nGreek insurrection, a number of Samians landed in Scio, and persuaded or\r\nforced its peaceful inhabitants to rise against the Turks. They did not\r\nsucceed in mastering the castle, and soon an army was landed from Asia,\r\nwho renewed the ancient calamities of the island. The plunder and\r\nmassacre that ensued was so unsparing that in a short time only 2000\r\nChristians were left out of a population of 110,000.\r\n\r\n=Scione.= The chief town in the Macedonian peninsula of Pallene, on the\r\nwestern coast. It revolted from the Athenians in the Peloponnesian war,\r\nbut was retaken by Cleon, whereupon all the men were put to death, the\r\nwomen and children sold as slaves, and the town given to the Platæans.\r\n\r\n=Scirtis.= A wild and mountainous district in the north of Laconia, on\r\nthe borders of Arcadia, with a town called Scirus, which originally\r\nbelonged to Arcadia. Its inhabitants, the Sciritæ, formed a special\r\ndivision of the Lacedæmonian army. This body, which, in the time of the\r\nPeloponnesian war, was 600 in number, was stationed in battle at the\r\nextreme left of the line, formed on march the vanguard, and was usually\r\nemployed on the most dangerous kinds of service.\r\n\r\n=Sconce.= In fortification, is a term applied to any small redoubt or\r\nfort, detached from the main works for some local object, as the defense\r\nof a pass or fort, etc. The word is not now often used.\r\n\r\n=Scopetin= (_Fr._). A rifleman was formerly so called who was armed with\r\nthe escopette.\r\n\r\n=Scordisci.= A people in Pannonia Superior, who are sometimes classed\r\namong the Illyrians, but were the remains of an ancient and powerful\r\nCeltic tribe. They dwelt between the Savus and Dravus.\r\n\r\n=Scorpion= (_Fr._). A small kind of catapult, or large cross-bow, which\r\nthrew heavy arrows by means of a steel bow, which was bent by a\r\ndouble-handed roller turned by one man.\r\n\r\n=Scorpion= (_Fr._). An ancient gun, whose dolphins represented the\r\nscorpion. Also the name of an implement used by the ancients for laying\r\nhold of the enemy’s battering ram.\r\n\r\n=Scotch Brigade.= A brigade of Scotchmen, gentlemen, and others, who\r\nserved under the elector of Bavaria in the reign of James I., and\r\nsubsequently under Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years’ War.\r\n\r\n=Scotland.= The northern division of the island of Great Britain. An\r\naccount has been given under the article Picts (which see) of the early\r\ninhabitants of the country which has long been known by the name of\r\nScotland. The original Scotia, or Scotland, was Ireland, and the Scoti,\r\nor Scots, at their first appearance in history were the people of\r\nIreland. The original seat of the Scots in Northern Britain was in\r\nArgyle, which they acquired by colonization and conquest before the end\r\nof the 5th century, and from whence they spread themselves along the\r\nwestern coast from the Firth of Clyde to the modern Ross. The first\r\nprince of the British Scots mentioned in authentic annals was Fergus,\r\nson of Eric, who crossed over to Britain about the year 503. His\r\ngreat-grandson, Conal, was king of the British Scots when Columba began\r\nthe conversion of the Northern Picts. His nephew, Aidan, who succeeded\r\nhim was a powerful prince, and more than once successfully invaded the\r\nEnglish border, but toward the end of his reign he received a severe\r\ndefeat from the Northumbrian sovereign Ethelfrid at the battle of\r\nDegsestan. The history of Aidan’s successors is obscure. Their kingdom\r\nwas overshadowed by the more powerful monarchy of the Picts, with which,\r\nas well as with its neighbors in the south,--the Britons of Cumbria,--it\r\nwas engaged in almost unceasing conflict. The Scots were for some time\r\nunder some sort of subjection to the English of Northumbria, but\r\nrecovered their independence on the defeat and death of King Egfried in\r\nbattle with the Picts at Nechtansmere in 685. In the middle of the 9th\r\ncentury, the Scots acquired a predominance in Northern Britain. Kenneth,\r\nson of Alpin, succeeded his father as king of the Scots. The Pictish\r\nkingdom was weakened by civil dissensions and a disputed claim to the\r\ncrown. The Picts and Scots, each speaking a dialect of the Celtic\r\ntongue, gradually coalesced into one people. The reign of Constantine,\r\nson of Aodh, who succeeded in 904, was a remarkable one. Even before the\r\nestablishment of the kingdom of the Picts and Scots in the person of\r\nKenneth, Northern Britain had experienced the attacks of a new enemy,\r\nthe Scandinavian invaders, generally spoken of under the name of Danes.\r\nConstantine resisted them bravely, but towards the end of his reign, he\r\nentered into an alliance with them in opposition to the English. A\r\npowerful army, composed of Scots, Picts, Britons, and Danes, disembarked\r\non the Humber, and was encountered at Brunanburgh by Athelstan, king of\r\nEngland. A battle was fought there, the first of a series of unfortunate\r\ncombats by Scottish princes on English ground. The confederate army was\r\ndefeated, but Constantine escaped, and died 953. During the reign of\r\nMalcolm I., a portion of the Cumbrian kingdom was bestowed by Edmund,\r\nking of England, on the Scottish sovereign. The northern kingdom was\r\nstill further increased in the reign of Kenneth, son of Malcolm, by the\r\nacquisition of Lothian and of Northern Cumbria, or Strathclyde.\r\nAlexander III. employed the period of his reign well; by a treaty with\r\nthe king of Norway, he added to his kingdom Man and the other islands of\r\nthe Western Sea. The reigns of David II. and his successors, Robert II.\r\nand Robert III., were the most wretched period of Scottish history. In\r\nthe year 1411, half of the kingdom would have become barbarous if the\r\ninvasion of the Lord of the Isles had not been repulsed at Harlaw (which\r\nsee). The vigorous rule of James I. had restored a tranquillity to which\r\nhis kingdom had long been unaccustomed; but strife and discord were\r\nagain brought back on his assassination. The reigns of Charles II. and\r\nJames VII. were more corrupt and oppressive than any which Scotland had\r\nexperienced since the regencies in the minority of James VI.; the\r\nnatural result was the revolution, which seated William and Mary on the\r\nthrone. Under James VI., who succeeded to the throne of England, the\r\nkingdoms became united, from which period (1603) the annals of the two\r\nkingdoms became almost identical, though they both retained their\r\nindependence, and continued to be ruled by separate titles till the Act\r\nof Union in 1707.\r\n\r\n=Scots Fusileer Guards.= See GUARDS.\r\n\r\n=Scots Grays.= The 2d regiment of dragoons in the British service is so\r\nnamed. They are considered a superior body of cavalry, and bear as their\r\nmotto “Second to None.”\r\n\r\n=Scott Projectile.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Scotussa.= A very ancient town of Thessaly, in the district of\r\nPelasgiotis, near the source of the Cynoscephalæ, where Flamininus\r\ngained his celebrated victory over Philip, 197 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Scour, To.= This term is frequently used to express the act of\r\ndischarging ordnance or musketry, rapidly and heavily, for the purpose\r\nof dislodging an enemy. Hence, to scour the rampart, or the covert way.\r\nIt likewise signifies to clear, to drive away; as, to scour the seas;\r\nalso to run about in a loose desultory manner; as, to scour the country.\r\n_To scour a line_, is to flank it, so as to see directly along it, that\r\na musket-ball entering at one end may fly to the other, leaving no place\r\nof security.\r\n\r\n=Scout.= A person sent out in the front or on the flank of an army to\r\nobserve the force and movements of the enemy. He should be a keen\r\nobserver, and withal fleet of foot, or well mounted.\r\n\r\n=Scout-master-General.= A person, formerly so called, under whose\r\ndirection all the scouts and army messengers were placed.\r\n\r\n=Screw.= See ELEVATING SCREW.\r\n\r\n=Screw-jack.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Scribe= (Heb. _Sofer_). Among the Jews, originally a kind of military\r\nofficer, whose business appears to have been the recruiting and\r\norganizing of troops, the levying of war-taxes, and the like. At a later\r\nperiod, especially at the time of Christ, it had come to designate a\r\nlearned man, a doctor of the law.\r\n\r\n=Scutari.= A town of Asiatic Turkey, opposite Constantinople. It was\r\nanciently called _Chrysopolis_, “golden city,” in consequence, it is\r\nsaid, of the Persians having established a treasury here when they\r\nattempted the conquest of Greece. Near here Constantine finally defeated\r\nLicinius, 323. Scutari Hospital was occupied by the sick and wounded of\r\nthe Anglo-French army in 1854-55, whose sufferings were much alleviated\r\nby the kind exertions of Miss Florence Nightingale and a band of nurses\r\nunder her.\r\n\r\n=Scutum.= A Roman buckler made of wood, the parts being joined together\r\nwith little plates of iron, and the whole covered with a bull’s hide. In\r\nthe middle was an _umbo_, or boss of iron, which jutted out, and was\r\nuseful to glance off stones or darts. The _scuta_, in general, were 4\r\nfeet long, and different in size from the _clypei_, which were less, and\r\nquite round.\r\n\r\n=Scythed.= Armed or furnished with scythes, as some of the ancient\r\nchariots were.\r\n\r\n=Scythia.= A name employed in ancient times to denote a vast,\r\nindefinite, and almost unknown territory north and east of the Black\r\nSea, the Caspian, and the Sea of Aral. This country was inhabited by a\r\nrace of people who were called Scythæ, but who called themselves\r\nScoloti. Only two important events in Scythian history are mentioned by\r\nHerodotus; the one is the invasion of Media by the Scythians, and the\r\nother that of Scythia by Darius. In 624 B.C. the Scythians entered\r\nMedia, defeated Cyaxares, the reigning monarch, and occupied the land\r\nfor twenty-eight years before they were expelled. It was at least\r\nostensibly in revenge for this incursion that Darius Hystaspis\r\ndetermined to invade Scythia about 513 B.C. He formed a bridge across\r\nthe Danube, and crossing that river obtained some advantages over the\r\nScythians. But he was unable to effect any real conquest over these\r\nnomad tribes, and narrowly escaped having his retreat cut off by the\r\ndestruction of the bridge.\r\n\r\n=Sea-coast Carriage.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Sea-coast Artillery.= Is a species of artillery which is used for the\r\ndefense of the sea-coast. In the United States it consists of 15-inch\r\nand 20-inch smooth-bores, 12-inch rifles, and 10-inch and 13-inch\r\nmortars. (See ORDNANCE.) The 24-pounder flank-defense howitzer, although\r\nno longer belonging to the system, is still employed in several of the\r\nforts on the sea-board. Sea-coast pieces are mounted on barbette,\r\ncasemate, and flank-casemate carriages; and the carriage upon which the\r\nmortar is mounted is called its _bed_. These carriages do not subserve\r\nthe purpose of transportation. The heaviest rifle-cannon should be\r\nplaced on the salients and flanks of a fortification, having an\r\nenfilading fire on a channel. Heavy smooth-bore pieces should occupy the\r\ncurtains and faces which bear, directly on the channel. The 24-pounder\r\nflank-defense howitzer is employed in the defense of ditches. Single- or\r\ndouble-shotted canister should be fired from it. The Gatling gun has\r\nbeen recommended as a desirable auxiliary in special cases. A 12-pounder\r\nfield-piece may be usefully employed to prevent a landing, or to fire in\r\nclose engagements at the rigging and boats of vessels. There are three\r\nkinds of fire generally employed,--_direct_, _ricochet_, and _plunging_.\r\nThe first should be used when the surface of the water is rough, and the\r\naccuracy of the rebound cannot be depended on. In aiming at a vessel\r\nwith _direct_ fire, the piece should be pointed at the water-line. The\r\neffective range of _direct_ fire is about one mile and a quarter. The\r\nintended effect of sea-coast mortars is to strike the decks of vessels,\r\npenetrating to the bottom and causing them to sink.\r\n\r\n=Sea-coast Howitzer.= See SEA-COAST ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n=Sea-horse.= In heraldry, a fabulous animal, consisting of the upper\r\npart of a horse with webbed feet, united to the tail of a fish. A\r\nscalloped fin is carried down the back. The arms of the town of\r\nCambridge are supported by two sea-horses, proper finned and maned or.\r\n\r\n=Sea-lion.= In heraldry, a monster consisting of the upper part of a\r\nlion combined with the tail of a fish.\r\n\r\n=Sealkote.= A town in the Punjab, near the left bank of the Chenab, 65\r\nmiles north-northeast from Lahore. All the European troops had been\r\nremoved in July, 1857, to repress disturbances that had broken out\r\nelsewhere, and on the 9th of that month the native troops fired on their\r\nofficers. A considerable number of Europeans were killed, and the\r\nsurvivors suffered great privations until the Sepoys, having plundered\r\nthe station, started off in the direction of Delhi.\r\n\r\n=Search a Country, To.= Is to examine minutely all the inlets and\r\noutlets, woods, rivers, etc., of a country through which an army is to\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n=Searcher.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Seasoned Troops.= Are troops that have been accustomed to climate, and\r\nare not so liable to become the victims of any endemical disorder as raw\r\nmen unavoidably are.\r\n\r\n=Seat of War.= The country in which a war is being carried on.\r\n\r\n=Sebastopol=, or =Sevastopol=. A Russian seaport, fortress, and arsenal\r\nin the Crimea, in the government of Taurida. It is situated near the\r\nsouthwest extremity of the Crimea, on the southern side of the\r\nmagnificent harbor or roadstead of Sebastopol, one of the finest natural\r\nharbors in the world. The siege of Sebastopol by the allied English and\r\nFrench armies will rank among the most famous sieges in history; it\r\nlasted for eleven months, from October, 1854, to September, 1855.\r\nImmediately after the battle of the Alma, September 20, 1854, the allied\r\narmy marched to Sebastopol, and took up its position on the plateau\r\nbetween it and Balaklava, and the grand attack and bombardment commenced\r\nOctober 17, 1854, without success. After many sanguinary encounters by\r\nday and night, and repeated bombardments, a grand assault was made on\r\nSeptember 8, 1855, upon the Malakoff tower and the redans, the most\r\nimportant fortifications to the south of the town. The French succeeded\r\nin capturing and retaining the Malakoff. The attacks of the English on\r\nthe great redan and of the French upon the little redan were successful,\r\nbut the assailants were compelled to retire after a desperate struggle\r\nwith great loss of life. The French lost 1646 killed, of whom 5 were\r\ngenerals, 24 superior and 116 inferior officers, 4500 wounded, and 1400\r\nmissing. The English lost 385 killed, 1886 wounded, and 176 missing. In\r\nthe night the Russians abandoned the southern and principal part of the\r\ntown and fortifications, after destroying as much as possible, and\r\ncrossed to the northern forts. They also sank or burnt the remainder of\r\ntheir fleet. The allies found a very great amount of stores when they\r\nentered the place, September 9. The works were utterly destroyed in\r\nApril, 1856, and the town was restored to the Russians in July.\r\n\r\n=Second.= The next in order to the first; the next in place or station;\r\nas, a second lieutenant of the artillery service.\r\n\r\n=Second Covert Way.= In fortification, is that beyond the second ditch.\r\n\r\n=Second Ditch.= In fortification, is that made on the outside of the\r\nglacis, when the ground is low and there is plenty of water.\r\n\r\n=Second Flank.= See FLANK, OBLIQUE.\r\n\r\n=Second, To.= To aid or assist; to support.\r\n\r\n=Secondary Bases.= The bases established at the beginning of a campaign\r\nand from which the first advances are made, are known as _primary\r\nbases_. An army carries with it ammunition only sufficient for one\r\nbattle, and but a few days’ supply of food. Other supplies of ammunition\r\nand provisions must be brought from the base; and as an army advances,\r\nthe difficulty of keeping it supplied increases. Unless some additional\r\nprovision be made for its supply, the army cannot advance and is then\r\nsaid to be “tied to its base.” As the necessary supplies cannot be\r\nobtained in the theatre of operations in sufficient quantities for the\r\ndaily needs of an army, depots and magazines must be organized near the\r\narmy from which these supplies can be procured, and these together form\r\nwhat is known as a _secondary base_.\r\n\r\n=Seconding.= In Great Britain, is a temporary retirement to which\r\nofficers of Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers are subjected when they\r\naccept civil employment under the crown. After six months of such\r\nemployment the officer is seconded, by which he loses military pay, but\r\nretains his rank, seniority, and promotion in his corps. After being\r\nseconded for ten years, he must elect to return to military duty or to\r\nretire altogether.\r\n\r\n=Secrecy.= In military economy this quality is peculiarly requisite. It\r\nsignifies fidelity to a secret; taciturnity inviolate; close silence.\r\nOfficers, in particular, should be well aware of the importance of it,\r\nas the divulging of what has been confidentially intrusted to them,\r\nespecially on expeditions, might render the whole project abortive. The\r\nslightest deviation from it is very justly considered a breach of honor,\r\nas scandalous conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. In official\r\nmatters the person so offending is liable to the severest punishment\r\nand penalty.\r\n\r\n=Secretary of War.= Is an officer of the executive department and member\r\nof the Cabinet, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate,\r\nand has charge of all duties connected with the army of the United\r\nStates, fortifications, etc., issues of commissions, movement of troops,\r\npayment, commissary, etc., and engineering. The following is extracted\r\nfrom the law of the United States:\r\n\r\n“There shall be at the seat of government an executive department to be\r\nknown as the Department of War, and a Secretary of War, who shall be the\r\nhead thereof.\r\n\r\n“The Secretary of War shall perform such duties as shall from time to\r\ntime be enjoined on or intrusted to him by the President relative to\r\nmilitary commissions, the military forces, the warlike stores of the\r\nUnited States, or to other matters respecting military affairs, and he\r\nshall conduct the business of the department in such manner as the\r\nPresident shall direct.\r\n\r\n“The Secretary of War shall have the custody and charge of all the\r\nbooks, records, papers, furniture, fixtures, and other property\r\nappertaining to the department.\r\n\r\n“The Secretary of War shall from time to time cause to be collected and\r\ntransmitted to him, at the seat of government, all such flags,\r\nstandards, and colors as are taken by the army from enemies of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n“The Secretary of War shall from time to time define and prescribe the\r\nkinds as well as the amount of supplies to be purchased by the\r\nsubsistence and quartermaster departments of the army, and the duties\r\nand powers thereof respecting such purchases, and shall prescribe\r\ngeneral regulations for the transportation of the articles or supply\r\nfrom the place of purchase to the several armies, garrisons, posts, and\r\nrecruiting-places, for the safe-keeping of such articles, and for the\r\ndistribution of an adequate and timely supply of the same to the\r\nregimental quartermasters, and to such other officers as may by virtue\r\nof such regulations be intrusted with the same, and shall fix and make\r\nreasonable allowances for the store rent and storage necessary for the\r\nsafe-keeping of all military stores and supplies.\r\n\r\n“The transportation of troops, munitions of war, equipments, military\r\nproperty, and stores, throughout the United States, shall be under the\r\nimmediate control and supervision of the Secretary of War and such\r\nagents as he may appoint.”\r\n\r\nThe British secretary of war was formerly a high officer of the British\r\nministry, having control of the financial arrangements of the army, and\r\nbeing the responsible medium for parliamentary supervision in military\r\naffairs. The formation of a war-office proper took place about 1620, the\r\nsecretary of state having previously performed its duties. It was,\r\nhowever, limited to financial authority, neither the commander-in-chief\r\nnor the muster-general of the ordnance being subject to it. During the\r\nRussian war the evils of this divided authority led to the creation of a\r\nsecretary of state for war, to control all the military departments. The\r\nsecretaryship-at-war was merged in the superior office in 1855, and\r\nabolished by act of Parliament in 1863. See MINISTER.\r\n\r\n=Section.= A certain proportion of a battalion or company, when it is\r\ntold off for military movements and evolutions.\r\n\r\n=Sector of Explosion.= At the moment that a gun is fired, there is a\r\nsort of spherical sector of fire formed in front of the piece, whose\r\nextremity presses against the bottom of the bore, while the external\r\nportion of it terminates in the air, which this sector compresses and\r\ndrives in every direction; the air thus forming a support, the sector\r\nreacts with its full force upon the bottom of the bore and causes the\r\nrecoil of the piece.\r\n\r\n=Secure, To.= In a military sense, is to preserve, to keep, to make\r\ncertain; as, to secure a plan; to secure a conquest. In the management\r\nof a musket, it signifies to bring it to a certain position, by which\r\nthe lock is secured against rain. Hence, _secure arms_ is a word of\r\ncommand which is given to troops who are under arms in wet weather.\r\n\r\n=Secuteur= (_Fr._). A gladiator who was armed with a helmet, shield, and\r\nsword, or leaden club, and who fought with the _Retiaire_.\r\n\r\n=Sedan.= A town of France, department of Ardennes, on the Meuse; it is\r\nfortified, and contains an arsenal and several magazines. On July 6,\r\n1641, a victory was gained at La Marfée, near Sedan, by the Count of\r\nSoissons and the troops of Bouillon and other French princes over the\r\nroyal army supporting Richelieu. On August 29-31, 1870, a series of\r\ndesperate conflicts took place here between the French Army of the North\r\nunder MacMahon (about 150,000 men), and the greater part of the three\r\nGerman armies, under the king and crown-prince of Prussia and the\r\ncrown-prince of Saxony (about 250,000 men), and was brought to a close\r\non September 1, 1870. The battle began with attacks on the French right\r\nand left, about 5 A.M., and was very severe at 2 P.M. At 4 P.M. the\r\nGermans remained masters of the field, and the crown-prince of Prussia\r\nannounced a complete victory, the chief part of the French army\r\nretreating into Sedan. The emperor Napoleon was present during the\r\nbattle, and, it is said, stood at Iges, near Sedan, exposed for four\r\nhours to the German grenades. The impossibility of further resistance\r\nwas then evident. The Germans had contracted their circle close around\r\nSedan; their formidable artillery held all the heights, from which they\r\ncould at pleasure wholly destroy the town and the army, and only 2000\r\nmen were in a condition to respond to their commander’s call, and to\r\nmake a supreme effort to break through the enemy with the emperor, and\r\nescape to Montmédy. At first, Gen. de Wimpffen (called to the command\r\nwhen MacMahon was wounded), indignantly rejected the terms offered by\r\nthe victor, and the emperor had a fruitless interview with Count\r\nBismarck to endeavor to mitigate them. On September 2, 1870, a\r\ncapitulation of Sedan and the whole army therein was signed by Gens. von\r\nMoltke and de Wimpffen, at the chateau of Bellevue, near Frenois. The\r\nconflict was principally carried on by the artillery, in which the\r\nGermans had the advantage, not only in number (600 to 500), but also in\r\nweight, range, and precision. The carnage was awful, and the field the\r\nnext day was a mass of shattered bones, torn flesh, and colored rags.\r\nAbout 25,000 French prisoners were taken in the battle, and 83,000\r\nsurrendered the next day, together with 70 mitrailleures, 400\r\nfield-pieces, and 150 fortress guns. About 14,000 French wounded were\r\nfound lying in the neighborhood, and about 3000 escaped into Belgium and\r\nlaid down their arms. The great Army of the North ceased to exist. On\r\nSeptember 1, the village of Bazeilles was stormed by the Bavarians and\r\nburnt, it was said, because the inhabitants fired on the ambulances;\r\nmany women and children perished. The French denied the provocation. The\r\nplace had been previously twice bombarded and stormed by the maddened\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\n=Sedgemoor.= A wild tract of England, in Somersetshire, between\r\nBridgewater and King’s Weston, where the Duke of Monmouth (the natural\r\nson of Charles II. by Lucy Walters), who had risen in rebellion on the\r\naccession of James II., was completely defeated by the royal army, July\r\n6, 1685. The duke was made a prisoner in the disguise of a peasant, at\r\nthe bottom of a ditch, overcome with hunger, fatigue, and anxiety.\r\n\r\n=Sedition.= In a military sense, is to disobey orders, to cabal or form\r\nfactions against the officer or officers in command; to loosen\r\nconfidence; to resist or oppose orders, or to stir up mutiny. It is an\r\noffense in military law of the most fatal character, and always punished\r\nin a most exemplary manner.\r\n\r\n=Sedusii.= A German people, forming part of the army of Ariovistus when\r\nhe invaded Gaul, 58 B.C.; they are not mentioned at a later period, and\r\nconsequently their site cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n=See, To.= In a military sense, is to have practical knowledge of a\r\nthing; as, to see service. _To have seen a shot fired_ is a figurative\r\nexpression in the British service, signifying to have been in action;\r\nalso, to have been under fire.\r\n\r\n=Seetabuldee.= A strong military position in Hindostan, near Nagpore,\r\nwhere a severe contest took place during the Mahratta war between the\r\nBoosla rajah and a small number of the British troops, in which the\r\nformer were defeated.\r\n\r\n=Segbans.= Are horsemen among the Turks who have care of the baggage\r\nbelonging to cavalry regiments.\r\n\r\n=Segesta.= A town situated in the northwest of Sicily, near the coast,\r\nbetween Panormus and Drepanum. Its inhabitants were constantly engaged\r\nin hostilities with Selinus; and it was at their solicitation that the\r\nAthenians were led to embark in their unfortunate expedition against\r\nSicily. The town was taken by Agathocles, who destroyed or sold as\r\nslaves all its inhabitants, peopled the city with a body of deserters,\r\nand changed its name into that of Dicæopolis; but after the death of\r\nthis tyrant, the remainder of the ancient inhabitants returned to the\r\ncity, and it resumed its former name.\r\n\r\n=Seistan= (formerly called _Segestan_). A khanat or principality of\r\nAsia, forming the southwest portion of Afghanistan. It was devastated by\r\nTamerlane in 1383.\r\n\r\n=Sejant=, or =Assis=. In heraldry, is the term of blazon applied to a\r\nbeast in his usual sitting posture. A lion borne in full face, with his\r\nforepaws extended sideways, is blazoned _sejant_ affronté, as in the\r\ncrest of Scotland.\r\n\r\n=Sejour= (_Fr._). In a military sense, signifies a halting day.\r\n\r\n=Selection.= The act of choosing in preference to others; hence,\r\nselection of officers to act upon the staff, etc.; to select quarters,\r\netc. See QUARTERS, CHOICE OF.\r\n\r\n=Seleucia ad Tigrin= (also called _Seleucia Babylonia_, _Seleucia\r\nAssyriæ_, and _Seleucia Parthorum_). A great city on the confines of\r\nAssyria and Babylonia, and for a long time the capital of Western Asia.\r\nIt commanded the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates. It was burned\r\nby Trajan in his Parthian expedition, and again by L. Verus, the\r\ncolleague of M. Aurelius Antoninus. It was again taken by Severus.\r\n\r\n=Seleucia Pieria= (ruins, called _Seleukeh_, or _Kepse_, near\r\n_Suadeiah_). A great city and fortress in Syria, founded by Seleucus in\r\nApril, 300 B.C. In the war with Egypt, which ensued upon the murder of\r\nAntiochus II., Seleucia surrendered to Ptolemy III. Euergetes (246\r\nB.C.). It was afterwards recovered by Antiochus the Great (219). In the\r\nwar between Antiochus VIII. and IX., the people of Seleucia made\r\nthemselves independent (109 or 108); afterwards they successfully\r\nresisted the attacks of Tigranes for fourteen years (84-70). The city\r\nhad fallen entirely into decay by the 6th century of our era.\r\n\r\n=Selictar.= A Turkish sabre.\r\n\r\n=Seljuks=, or =Seljuk-Turks=. A small Turkish tribe which, at an early\r\ndate, took possession of Bokhara and the surrounding country. They\r\nattracted the notice of Sultan Mahmoud, the founder of the dynasty of\r\nthe Ghuznevides, who had advanced into Bokhara with his army, and was so\r\nimpressed with the fine military qualities of their chief, that he\r\ninduced them to cross the Oxus and to occupy the country of Khorassan.\r\nHe had soon reason to repent of this fatal error. Like all those\r\nwandering hordes, the Turkomans were shepherds or robbers. They either\r\nmolested the neighboring states by petty inroads, or, with the whole\r\nunited force of the nation, they practiced robbery on a great scale,\r\nseizing on kingdoms and despoiling nations. The first migrations of\r\nthese Eastern Turkomans is generally fixed in the 10th century. They\r\nbecame formidable to Mahmoud, and more especially to his successor,\r\nMassoud, who, from inability to resist their progress, was forced to\r\ngrant them lands. He was afterwards defeated by them in a great battle;\r\nand the victorious Turks, under their leader, Togrul Beg, whom they now\r\nelected king, invaded Khorassan, and finally expelled the Ghuznevides,\r\nthe descendants of Mahmoud, from the eastern provinces of Persia. They\r\nfled eastwards towards the Indus, and established the Ghuznian empire in\r\nthe northwestern provinces of India. This empire was maintained with\r\nvarious success till about the year 1184, under the Ghuznian emperors,\r\nwhen they were superseded by that of the Afghan or Patan emperors, who\r\ncompleted the conquest of the greatest part of Hindustan Proper about\r\n1210. Togrul Beg hastened to improve his victory over the Persian\r\nmonarch. Turning his arms to the west, he invaded Irak, in the centre of\r\nPersia, and advancing westward of the Caspian Sea into Azerbijan, the\r\nancient Media, he made his first approaches to the confines of the Roman\r\nempire. He afterwards proceeded to Bagdad, and by his conquest of that\r\nplace, gained possession of the caliph. His successors Alp Arslan and\r\nMalek Shah extended the empire transmitted to them by Togrul Beg. They\r\nsubdued the fairest portions of Asia. Jerusalem and the Holy Land were\r\ntaken and pillaged by the Seljuks, and it was the vexation and rapine to\r\nwhich the Christian pilgrims were exposed in their journey to Jerusalem,\r\nthat gave rise to those wild and warlike expeditions for the recovery of\r\nthe Holy Land, known under the name of the Crusades. The empire under\r\nMalek Shah extended from the Mediterranean to the Chinese frontier, and\r\nfrom the Caspian to the Arabian Sea. Upon the death of Malek Shah the\r\nempire was divided up into petty sultanates, which finally caused the\r\noverthrow of the Seljuk empire. The Turkish dynasty of the Seljuks\r\ncontinued for 215 years, and with the overthrow of its dynasty in 1299,\r\nand on its ruins, arose the Turkish empire.\r\n\r\n=Selkirkshire= (formerly called the _Ettrick Forest_). A small inland\r\ncounty of Scotland, in the Lowlands. Among the interesting historical\r\nscenes this county contains is the field of Philiphaugh, where the great\r\nMarquis of Montrose was defeated by the Covenanters under Gen. Leslie.\r\n\r\n=Sell Out.= In the British service, was a term generally used when an\r\nofficer was permitted to retire from the service, selling or disposing\r\nof his commission or commissions. It was the correlative word to _buy\r\nin_. Officers who purchased commissions were usually allowed to sell\r\nout.\r\n\r\n=Sellasia.= A town in Laconia, north of Sparta, situated near the River\r\nŒnus, and commanded one of the principal passes leading to Sparta. Here\r\nthe celebrated battle was fought between Cleomenes III. and Antigonus\r\nDoson, 221 B.C., in which the former was defeated.\r\n\r\n=Selling Ammunition.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 16.\r\n\r\n=Selymbria=, or =Selybria= (now _Selivria_). An important town in\r\nThrace, on the Propontis. It was a colony of the Megarians. It was\r\nconquered by Philip, father of Alexander.\r\n\r\n=Semaphore.= A machine for facilitating the internal communications of\r\nthe country by means of telegraphic signals, especially between the\r\ngovernment and the military or naval functionaries of the outposts; but\r\nits use has been entirely superseded by the introduction of the railways\r\nand the electric telegraph.\r\n\r\n=Semé.= In heraldry, when a charge is repeated an indefinite number of\r\ntimes so as to produce the appearance of a pattern, the term semé\r\n(sometimes _aspersed_ or _powdered_) is applied to it. When a field is\r\nsemé, it is treated as if it were cut out of a larger extent of surface,\r\nsome of the charges being divided by the outline of the shield. The term\r\n_crusilly_ denotes semé of cross crosslets, and _billetty_ semé of\r\nbillets.\r\n\r\n=Semendria.= A frontier fortress of the principality of Servia, on the\r\nright bank of the Danube, 28 miles southeast of Belgrade. It has\r\nfrequently been stormed by the nations who have contended for the Danube\r\nfrom the Middle Ages to the present century.\r\n\r\n=Seminara.= A town of Naples, province of Calabria Ultra II. Near here\r\nGonsalvo de Cordova, the great captain, was defeated by the French, in\r\n1495; but defeated them April 21, 1503.\r\n\r\n=Seminoles.= A tribe of Indians who formerly inhabited Central Florida,\r\nbut now located on a reservation in the Indian Territory. During the\r\ntime they were in Florida they became allies of the British in their\r\nincursions into Georgia during the Revolutionary war. They commenced a\r\nseries of border-forays in 1794, when their numbers were largely\r\nincreased by fugitive slaves and negroes; their force was also augmented\r\nby the Creeks in 1808. They invaded the frontiers of Georgia in 1812 and\r\n1817, when they massacred a number of persons; but were speedily\r\npunished by Gen. Gaines and subsequently by Gen. Jackson. Florida was\r\npurchased by the United States in 1819, and the Seminoles made treaties\r\nwith the United States a few years afterwards. The government resolved\r\nto move the Seminoles to a reservation beyond the Mississippi, in\r\nconformity with a treaty signed in 1832, but the Indians, headed by\r\nOsceola, their chief, resisted, which gave rise to a prolonged bloody\r\nwar, which began in December, 1835. This war cost the U. S. government\r\n$10,000,000 and 1500 lives. The greater portion of the Seminoles were\r\nsubdued and transported beyond the Mississippi in 1842, only about 300\r\nremaining in the Everglades of Florida, under their chief, Billy\r\nBowlegs. The Seminoles on their new reservation in Indian Territory were\r\ndivided in their sentiments during the civil war, some of them taking up\r\narms for the South; a civil contest ensued, in which those remaining\r\nloyal to the Union were defeated with great slaughter in December, 1861.\r\nAfter the civil war the two bands were reunited and purchased a\r\nreservation from the Creeks, where they are now industrious and\r\nprosperous. In 1870 they numbered 2553.\r\n\r\n=Semi-steel.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR, STEEL.\r\n\r\n=Sempach.= A small town of Switzerland, in the canton of Lucerne,\r\nsituated on the eastern shore of the Lake of Sempach. It was one of the\r\noutposts of the confederate cantons against their Suabian and Austrian\r\nassailants in the 14th century. Under the walls of Sempach took place\r\nthe second great conflict of the confederate Swiss cantons with Austria,\r\nin which the nobles of Austria, in spite of their valor and overwhelming\r\nnumbers, were slaughtered like sheep by the Swiss. The Swiss lost but\r\n200 men, while the loss of the Austrians was ten times as great. The\r\nanniversary of this great victory is still celebrated by prayer and\r\nthanksgiving on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n=Sena.= A town on the coast of Umbria, at the mouth of the small river\r\nSena, was founded by the Senones, a Gallic people, and was made a colony\r\nby the Romans after the conquest of the Senones, 283 B.C. In the civil\r\nwar it espoused the Marian party, and was taken and sacked by Pompey.\r\n\r\n=Seneca Indians.= One of the tribes of the Six Nations, and the most\r\nnumerous and warlike of that confederation. When they first became known\r\nthey were located in the region between the Lakes of Cayuga, Seneca,\r\nCanandaigua, and Ontario. In the 17th century they waged successful wars\r\nagainst the Hurons and other tribes to the westward, and finally the\r\ndefeated tribes were adopted by the Senecas, who by this means of\r\nrecruiting their ranks became a powerful people. They were firm allies\r\nof the English, as was attested in several battles against the French,\r\nand took a valiant part in the memorable battle wherein Gen. Braddock\r\nwas killed; they again suffered severely in the campaign led by Gen.\r\nSullivan in 1779. They removed to Lake Erie in 1784. The Senecas were\r\nallies of the Americans in the war of 1812-14. In 1870 there were 240\r\nSenecas on a reservation in Indian Territory, and 3017 on a reservation\r\nin the State of New York.\r\n\r\n=Seneffe=, or =Senef=. A town in the province of Hainault, Belgium,\r\nabout 11 miles northwest of Charleroi. Seneffe is notable for its\r\nproximity to the battle-field on which William of Orange (III. of\r\nEngland), at the head of the forces of the coalition against France,\r\nfought the French army under the great Condé, August 11, 1674. In\r\nWilliam’s army there were four lieutenants,--Montecuculi, Duke Charles\r\nof Lorraine, the Prince of Waldeck, and the Prince of Vaudemont, the\r\nfirst three of whom subsequently attained prominence as military\r\ncommanders. Of the allied forces of 60,000 men, the Dutch lost from 5000\r\nto 6000 men, the Spaniards 3000, and the Imperialists 600; while the\r\nFrench army, which entered into the conflict 30,000 strong, could\r\nscarcely muster 20,000 after the battle. Under the walls of Seneffe,\r\nMoreau, in 1794, defeated the Austrians.\r\n\r\n=Senegal.= French colonies on the river of that name in Senegambia, West\r\nAfrica, settled about 1626; several times taken by the British, but\r\nrecovered by the French, to whom they were finally restored in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Seneschal.= In the origin of the office, probably an attendant of the\r\nservile class, who had the superintendence of the household of the\r\nFrankish kings. In the course of time, however, the seneschalship rose\r\nto be a position of dignity, held no longer by persons of servile race,\r\nbut by military commanders, who were also invested with judicial\r\nauthority. The lieutenants of the great feudatories often took the title\r\nof seneschal. A similar office in England and Scotland was designated\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\n=Seniority.= Priority of rank and standing in the army. As regards\r\nregiments, this precedence is regulated by the number of the corps;\r\namong individuals, it is decided by the date of the commission. Where\r\ncommissions of the same date interfere, reference is to be had to the\r\ndates of former commissions.\r\n\r\n=Senones.= A powerful people in Gallia Lugdunensis, dwelt along the\r\nupper course of the Sequana (now _Seine_). A portion of this people\r\ncrossed the Alps about 40 B.C., in order to settle in Italy; but the\r\ngreater part of Upper Italy being already occupied by other Celtic\r\ntribes, the Senones were obliged to penetrate a considerable distance to\r\nthe south, and took up their abode on the Adriatic Sea, between the\r\nmodern Ravenna and Ancona. They extended their ravages into Etruria; and\r\nit was in consequence of the interference of the Romans while they were\r\nlaying siege to Clusium, that they marched against Rome and took the\r\ncity, 390 B.C. They were defeated by Camillus, 367 B.C. They defeated\r\nMetellus, the consul, at Arretium, 284, but were almost exterminated by\r\nDolabella, 283. They invaded Greece in 279; were defeated by Antigonus\r\nGonatus, 278, and sued for peace. See ROME.\r\n\r\n=Sent to the Front.= A term applied to bodies of troops or individual\r\nsoldiers when ordered from camp or garrison to the scene of active\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\n=Sent to the Rear.= A term applied to bodies of troops or individual\r\nsoldiers when ordered from the immediate scene of active hostilities to\r\nthe rear of the command in which they are serving, so as to be out of\r\nimmediate danger.\r\n\r\n=Sentence.= Decision, determination, final judgment. There is an appeal\r\nallowed from the sentence of a regimental court-martial to the opinion\r\nof a general one.\r\n\r\n=Sentinel=, or =Sentry= (from the Lat. _sentire_, “to feel or perceive,”\r\nthrough the Ital. _sentinella_). A private soldier, marine, or sailor,\r\nposted at a point of trust, with the duty of watching the approach of an\r\nenemy, or any person suspected of hostile intentions. Sentinels mount\r\nguard over dépots of arms, the tents of commanding officers, etc. During\r\nthe night, each sentinel is intrusted with the “word,” or countersign;\r\nand no person, however exalted in position, may attempt to approach or\r\npass him without giving that as a signal. In such case, the sentinel is\r\nbound to arrest the intruder, and if necessary to shoot him. It has\r\nhappened before now that the commander-in-chief of an army has been\r\nprisoner in the hands of one of his own sentinels. When an army is in\r\nthe field, the sentinels are its eyes, for they guard the approaches in\r\nevery direction some distance in front of the main body of troops. In\r\nthe event of an attack, they give the alarm, and retire slowly on their\r\nsupports. There is usually an agreement, tacit or expressed, between\r\ncommanders that their outlying sentinels shall not fire upon one\r\nanother, which would only be productive of useless bloodshed. Under\r\nmartial law, death is the penalty to a sentinel sleeping on post.\r\nSentinels will present arms to general and field-officers, to the\r\nofficer of the day, and the commanding officer of a post; to all other\r\nofficers they will carry arms. Staff-officers above the rank of captain\r\nare entitled to the same compliments from sentinels as are given to\r\nfield-officers.\r\n\r\n=Sentinum, Battle of.= See ROME.\r\n\r\n=Sentry.= The same as sentinel. “Sentry go,” is the warning given by the\r\nsentry at the guard-room or tent that it is time to relieve sentries.\r\n\r\n=Sentry-box.= A box to cover a sentinel at his post, and shelter him\r\nfrom the weather.\r\n\r\n=Sepadar.= Is an East Indian term for an officer of the rank of\r\nbrigadier-general.\r\n\r\n=Sepahi.= An East Indian term for a feudatory chief, or military tenant;\r\na soldier.\r\n\r\n=Sepoy.= Corrupted from the Indian word _sipahi_, “a soldier.” This word\r\nsipahi, in its more familiar form of _spahis_, is known in most Eastern\r\narmies; and is itself derived from _sip_, “a bow and arrow,” the\r\nordinary armament of an Indian soldier in ancient times. The word Sepoy\r\nnow denotes a native Hindoo soldier in the British army in India. The\r\nSepoys consist of Mohammedans, Rajpoots, Brahmans, and men of other\r\ncastes, besides Sikhs, Ghoorkas, and men of various hill-tribes. They\r\nare generally officered by Europeans.\r\n\r\n=Septembrizers.= In the French revolution a dreadful massacre took\r\nplace in Paris, September 2-5, 1792. The prisons were broken open and\r\nthe prisoners butchered, among them an ex-bishop, and nearly 100\r\nnon-juring priests. Some accounts state the number of persons slain at\r\n1200, others at 4000. The agents in this slaughter were named\r\nSeptembrizers.\r\n\r\n=Sepulchre, Knights of the Holy.= A military order, established in\r\nPalestine about the year 1114. Those of this class chose Philip II.,\r\nking of Spain, for their master, in 1558, and afterwards his son; but\r\nthe grand master of the order of Malta prevailed on him to resign; and\r\nwhen afterwards the Duke de Nevers assumed the same quality in France,\r\nthe same grand master, by his interest and credit, procured a like\r\nrenunciation by him, and a confirmation of the union of this order to\r\nthat of Malta.\r\n\r\n=Sequani.= A Celtic nation of ancient Gaul. Before the conquest of Gaul\r\nby Cæsar, the Arverni and Ædui, the two most powerful nations of that\r\ncountry, were in a state of hostility; and the Sequani allied themselves\r\nwith the former. In order more effectually to crush their enemies, these\r\ntwo nations hired a large body of Germans, under Ariovistus, from over\r\nthe Rhine. With their assistance they totally defeated the Ædui; but the\r\nGermans seized for themselves a third part of the territory of the\r\nSequani, and would have made further encroachments, had not Cæsar\r\ndefeated them, and expelled them from the land.\r\n\r\n=Serakhur, Serang.= In the East Indies are non-commissioned officers who\r\nare employed in the artillery and on board ships of war. In the\r\nartillery the former title answers to that of sergeant; in the naval\r\nservice the latter to that of boatswain.\r\n\r\n=Seraphim, or Jesus, Order of The.= An ancient Swedish order of\r\nknighthood, instituted in 1334; but dormant from the period of the\r\nReformation until 1748. The number of knights, besides the king and\r\nmembers of the royal family, is limited to 24.\r\n\r\n=Seraskier=, or =Seri-Asker= (_Pers._ “head of the army”). The name\r\ngiven by the Turks to every general having the command of a separate\r\narmy, and, in particular, to the commander-in-chief or minister of war.\r\nThe seraskier, in the latter sense, possesses most extensive authority,\r\nbeing subordinate only to the sultan and grand vizier. He is selected by\r\nthe monarch from among the pashas of two or three tails.\r\n\r\n=Seraskur= (_Ind._). This word is sometimes written _seraskier_, and\r\nsignifies the commander-in-chief of a Turkish army.\r\n\r\n=Serdans.= Colonels in the Turkish service are so called.\r\n\r\n=Seregno.= A town in the province of Milan, Italy, 13 miles north from\r\nMilan. It is noted for the heroic resistance which the women of the city\r\nmade against the conscription, and which ultimately induced Bonaparte\r\nto rescind his order for the bombardment of the place. The Austrians, in\r\n1848, severely chastised Seregno for its patriotism.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant.= A non-commissioned officer in a company, battery, or troop,\r\nusually selected from among the corporals on account of his general\r\nintelligence and good conduct. He is vested with the command of small\r\ndetachments, and sometimes with his company in the absence of his\r\nsuperior officers.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Armorer-.= In the British service, is a trained artificer who\r\nrepairs the arms of a corps.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Band-.= In the British service, is a non-commissioned officer\r\nwho is responsible for the discipline of the band, as is the bandmaster\r\nfor instruction.

Philip Augustus, fearing to\r\nbe assassinated on the instigation of the sheik of the mountain, during\r\nhis stay in Palestine, organized for the protection of his person a\r\ncorps of _sergeants d’armes_, consisting of gentlemen, which he armed\r\nwith bronze war-clubs, and bows and arrows, whose duty it was to\r\naccompany him everywhere.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Drill-.= See DRILL-SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Hospital.= In the British service, is a non-commissioned\r\nofficer who carries out the orders of the surgeon as regards discipline\r\nin a hospital.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant Instructor in Fencing.= In the British service, is a sergeant\r\nwho performs the duties implied by his title in regiments of cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant Instructor in Gunnery.= A sergeant of artillery who aids the\r\nofficer instructor in teaching gunnery.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Lance-.= Is a corporal who acts as a sergeant in a company,\r\nbut only receives the pay of a corporal.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant-Major.= The chief non-commissioned officer in a regiment, and,\r\nfrom the nature of his duties, in a great degree an assistant to the\r\nadjutant. He must be master of every point connected with the drill,\r\ninterior economy, and discipline of a regiment. It is his duty, on\r\nreceiving the orders from the adjutant, to assemble the orderly\r\nsergeants, and issue the orders and details correctly. He is to keep a\r\nregular duty roster of the sergeants and corporals, and to proportion\r\nthe number of men to be furnished for duty according to the strength of\r\ntheir respective companies. Finally, it is always expected that he\r\nshould set an example to the non-commissioned officers by his activity,\r\nzeal, and personal appearance. In the British cavalry service this\r\nnon-commissioned officer is termed regimental sergeant-major, the chief\r\nnon-commissioned officer of a troop being styled troop sergeant-major.\r\nSimilarly in the artillery there are the brigade sergeant-major and the\r\nbattery sergeant-major.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Orderly.= See ORDERLY SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Pay-.= See PAY-SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Paymaster-.= See PAYMASTER-SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Pioneer.= See PIONEER SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, Quartermaster.= See QUARTERMASTER SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n=Sergeant, White.= Is a term of ridicule in the British service, applied\r\nto those ladies who, taking advantage of the weakness of their husbands,\r\nneglect their domestic concerns to interfere in military matters.\r\n\r\n=Seringapatam= (anc. _Sri-Rungaputtun_, “City of Vishnu”). A celebrated\r\nfortress of South India, and under Hyder Ali and Tippoo Sahib, the\r\ncapital of Mysore, at the west angle of the island of the Cavery\r\n(Kaveri). Seringapatam was besieged by Lord Cornwallis in 1791, and\r\nagain in 1792, when Tippoo purchased a peace by ceding half his\r\ndominions and paying 330 lacs of rupees to the British and their allies.\r\nIt was again besieged in 1799 and taken by storm on May 3 (4), on which\r\noccasion Tippoo was killed, and the dynasty of Hyder terminated; the\r\nancient Rajpoot line being restored to the sovereignty of Mysore.\r\n\r\n=Serjeant.= See SERGEANT.\r\n\r\n=Serpenteau= (_Fr._). A round iron circle, with small spikes, and squibs\r\nattached to them. It is frequently used in the attack and defense of a\r\nbreach. It likewise means a fusee, which is filled with gunpowder, and\r\nis bent in such a manner, that when it takes fire, it obtains a circular\r\nrapid motion, and throws out sparks of light in various directions.\r\n\r\n=Serpentine= (_Fr._). An ancient wall-piece, with a matchlock, carrying\r\nan 8-ounce leaden ball, with a charge of 4 ounces of powder. It was 6 or\r\n7 feet long, and weighed from one to two hundred-weight.\r\n\r\n=Serpentix= (_Fr._). Cock of the ancient matchlock, also the lock\r\nitself. Also, an ancient 24-pounder gun, of 13 feet, weighing 4360\r\npounds, whose dolphins represented the figures of serpents.\r\n\r\n=Serre-demi File= (_Fr._). That rank in a battalion which determines the\r\nhalf of its depth, and which marches before the demi-file. Thus a\r\nbattalion standing six deep, has its _serre-demi file_ in the third\r\nrank, which determines its depth.\r\n\r\n=Serre-file= (_Fr._). The last rank of a battalion, by which its depth\r\nis ascertained, and which always forms its rear. When ranks are doubled,\r\nthe battalion resumes its natural formation by means of the\r\nserre-files. _Serre-file_ literally signifies a “bringer up.”\r\n\r\n=Servans d’Armes=, or =Chevaliers Servans= (_Fr._). Were persons\r\nbelonging to the third class of the order of Malta. They were not\r\nnoblemen, although they wore the sword and the cross.\r\n\r\n=Servants.= In the British service, regimental and staff officers are\r\nallowed the indulgence of a steady and well-drilled soldier for a\r\nservant; and field-officers, keeping horses, two each. These soldiers\r\nare to take their share of any duty on which the officer to whom they\r\nare attached is employed, and they must fall in with their respective\r\ntroops and companies at all reviews, inspections, and field-days. In the\r\nU. S. service, officers are not permitted to employ soldiers as\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n=Serve.= To be in service; to do duty; to discharge the requirements of\r\nan office or employment; and, specifically, to act as a soldier, seaman,\r\netc. _To serve a piece_, in the artillery, is to load and fire with\r\npromptitude and correctness. _To serve the vent_, to stop it with the\r\nthumb.\r\n\r\n=Servia.= One of the Danubian principalities, nominally included in the\r\nOttoman empire, but in reality only tributary to that power. It is\r\nbounded on the north by Austria, on the east by Wallachia and Bulgaria,\r\non the south by Rumli and Bosnia, and on the west by Bosnia. In the\r\nearliest times of which we have any record, Servia was inhabited by\r\nThracian or Illyrian races; shortly before Christ it was subjugated by\r\nthe Romans, and formed part of the province of Illyricum, whose fortunes\r\nit shared during the vicissitudes of the empire. Overrun successively by\r\nthe Huns, Ostrogoths, Longobards, etc., it reverted to the Byzantine\r\nrulers about the middle of the 6th century, but was wrested from them by\r\nthe Avars in the 7th century, who in turn were routed by the Serbs, and\r\ncompelled to give up the country. They were converted to Christianity in\r\nthe 9th century, but this did not in the least abate their ardor for\r\nbattle, and for nearly 200 years they were almost constantly at war with\r\nthe neighboring Bulgarians,--the inveterate enemies of their Byzantine\r\nliege lord. In 1043, however, the royal governors were expelled, and\r\nthey became an independent kingdom. For the next 100 years the Serbs had\r\nto fight hard to maintain their independence, and the struggle\r\nterminated in their favor; and in 1165, Stephen Nemanja founded a\r\ndynasty which lasted for two centuries, during which period the kingdom\r\nof Servia attained the acmé of its power and prosperity. Eventually the\r\nprogress of the Turks, however, was fatal to its welfare, and in 1389\r\nKing Lazar fell in the disastrous battle at Kossovapolje. Sultan Bajazet\r\ndivided the country between Lazar’s son and son-in-law, compelled them\r\nto pay tribute and follow him in war. Gradually the Serbs sunk more and\r\nmore under the Turkish yoke, until, in 1459, Servia was thoroughly\r\nsubjugated by the sultan Mahmoud. It was uniformly the theatre of the\r\nbloody wars between Hungary and Turkey, and frequently suffered the\r\nuttermost horrors of devastation. Prince Eugène’s brilliant successes\r\nfor a moment flashed a ray of hope into the miserable hearts of the\r\nlong-suffering Serbs, and by the treaty of Passarowitz (1718), a\r\nconsiderable portion of the country was made over to Austria; but in\r\n1739 it reverted to Turkey, and for the next sixty years the cruelty and\r\noppressions of the pashas and their Janissaries surpass all belief. At\r\nlength the unhappy people could endure the tyranny of their foreign\r\nmasters no longer, and in 1801 an insurrection broke out, headed by\r\nGeorge Czerny, which, by the help of Russia, ended in the triumph of the\r\npatriots, and in the election of Czerny by the people as prince of\r\nServia. The invasion of Russia by France, however, left the Serbs at the\r\nmercy of their late rulers and the war again broke out. Czerny was\r\nforced to flee, and the tyranny of the Turks became more ferocious than\r\never. Again the people flew to arms under the leadership of Milosch\r\nObrenovitch, and were a second time successful in winning back their\r\nliberties. Milosch ruled as prince of Servia until 1839, when he was\r\nforced to abdicate; but in 1858 he was restored to his former dignity.\r\nIn the war between Russia and Turkey in 1876, the Servians took the side\r\nof the former, but were not actively engaged.\r\n\r\n=Service.= In a military sense is the art of serving the state in war.\r\nAll studies, acts, and efforts of the profession of arms have this end\r\nin view. To belong to the army and to belong to the land service, are\r\nthe same thing. In a more restricted sense, service is the performance\r\nof military duty.

See PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n=Seven Years’ War.= This was the third, last, and by far the longest and\r\nmost terrible of the contests for the possession of Silesia. This long\r\nand desperate war was maintained by Frederick II. of Prussia against\r\nAustria, Russia, and France, from 1756 to 1763. It made no change in the\r\nterritorial distribution of Europe, but it increased tenfold the moral\r\npower of Prussia, and gave its army a prestige it retained till the\r\nbattle of Jena. It cost Europe 1,000,000 lives, and prostrated the\r\nstrength of almost all the powers who had engaged in it.\r\n\r\n=Seville=, or =Sevilla= (anc. _Hispalis_, or _Hispal_). A famous city of\r\nSpain, capital of the province of the same name, on the left bank of the\r\nGuadalquiver, 60 miles north-northeast of Cadiz. It was captured by\r\nJulius Cæsar, 45 B.C.

The fire-arm is loaded by depressing the lever, or\r\ntrigger-guard, which withdraws the slide and opens the breech for the\r\ninsertion of the cartridge. Originally a paper cartridge was used, the\r\nrear end of which was broken open by the breech-piece in closing; this\r\nwas superseded by a linen cloth cylinder to contain the powder, one end\r\nof which overlaps and is gummed to the base of the bullet; the other is\r\nclosed with a layer of thin bank-note paper. The flame of the\r\npercussion-cap penetrates through this paper and ignites the powder. The\r\nlinen case is carried out with the bullet and drops to the ground a\r\nshort distance in front of the piece. A metallic cartridge is now used.\r\n\r\n=Sharpsburg.= See ANTIETAM CREEK.\r\n\r\n=Sharpshooters.= An old term applied in the army to riflemen.\r\n\r\n=Sharp-shooting.= A shooting with great precision and effect.\r\n\r\n=Shawnees.= A tribe of American Indians, which were first known on the\r\nbanks of Fox River, Wisconsin, in 1648.

The Shawnees eventually became a scattered\r\nrace, and dispersed to several parts of the country; we find a part of\r\nthem afterwards taking part with the French in their wars in America;\r\njoined in Pontiac’s conspiracy, but were subdued by Col. Boquet. They\r\ntook a prominent part in the Western wars, especially against the\r\nexpeditions of Harmer, Wayne, etc.; but made peace at Greenville in\r\n1795. They afterwards effected an alliance with some tribes of\r\nNorthwestern Indians, and under their celebrated leader Tecumseh gave\r\nbattle to the whites under Gen. Harrison, at Tippecanoe, but were\r\ndefeated. Tecumseh, with a band of Shawnees, proceeded to Canada at the\r\noutbreak of the war of 1812, and made an alliance with the English, who\r\ngave him a brigadier-general’s commission; he was killed while leading\r\nthe right wing at the battle of the Thames in 1813. Since then the\r\nShawnees have again reunited and are now upon reservations in Indian\r\nTerritory, and numbered in 1870 about 800.\r\n\r\n=Sheaf.= A bundle of arrows.\r\n\r\n=Sheathe.= To put into a sheath, case, or scabbard; to inclose or cover\r\nwith a sheath or case. _To sheathe the sword_, to put an end to war or\r\nenmity; to make peace.\r\n\r\n=Sheeting.= The term sheeting is applied to the coarse hempen cloth used\r\nfor making tarpaulins.\r\n\r\n=Sheffield.= A large town of England in the West Riding of Yorkshire, at\r\nthe confluence of the Sheaf and Don, 43 miles southwest from York.\r\nDuring the civil wars in the time of Charles I., the castle sustained a\r\nlong siege for the king, but scarcely a vestige of it can now be\r\ndiscerned.\r\n\r\n=Shell.= To throw shells or bombs upon; to bombard; as, to shell a town.\r\n\r\n=Shell Extractor.= An instrument for extracting headless cartridge-cases\r\nfrom breech-loading small-arms.\r\n\r\n=Shell-hooks.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Shelling.= The act of bombarding a fort, town, or position.\r\n\r\n=Shell-jacket.= An undress military jacket.\r\n\r\n=Shell-plug Screw.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Shell-proof.= Capable of resisting bomb-shells.\r\n\r\n=Shells.= Hollow projectiles; also, the cases of metallic cartridges for\r\nuse in small-arms. See PROJECTILES.\r\n\r\n=Shelter.= In a military sense, that which protects the troops in the\r\nfield. There are various means resorted to for this purpose. A common\r\narrangement is as follows: A cross-bar is supported by two uprights;\r\nagainst this cross-bar a number of poles are made to lean; on the back\r\nof the poles abundance of fir branches are laid horizontally; and\r\nlastly, on the back of the fir branches is another set of leaning poles,\r\nin order to make all secure by their weight. A cloth of any kind is made\r\nuse of to give shelter by an arrangement of this kind. The corners of\r\nthe cloth should be secured by a simple hitch in the rope, and not by a\r\nknot. The former is sufficient for all purposes of security, but the\r\nlatter will jam, and you may have to injure both cloth and string to get\r\nit loose again. It is convenient to pin a skewer in the middle of the\r\nsides of the cloth, round the ropes.\r\n\r\n_Shelter-tents_ affording an excellent protection for 6 soldiers may be\r\nmade as follows: Three tent-sticks are fixed into the ground, whose tops\r\nare notched; a light cord is then passed round their tops, and fastened\r\ninto the ground with a peg at each end. Two sheets are then buttoned\r\ntogether and thrown over the cord, then two others, which are buttoned\r\nto the previous ones. Lastly, another sheet is thrown over each of the\r\nslanting cords, and buttoned to the others. The sides of the tent are,\r\nof course, pegged to the ground. There are many modifications in the way\r\nof pitching these tents. For want of sticks muskets can be used.\r\n\r\n_Huts_ are also frequently used as a means of protection by troops, as\r\nthere is scarcely any place which does not furnish materials for their\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n_Walls._--Those principally in use are as follows: Skins, canvas, felt,\r\ntarpaulin, bark, reed mats, reed walls, straw walls, wattle-and-dab, log\r\nhuts, fascines or fagots, boards, etc., fastened by malay-hitch, brick,\r\nsunburnt or baked, turf, stones, gabions, bags or mats filled with sand\r\nor shingle, snow huts, underground huts, tents over holes in earth.\r\n\r\n_Roofs._--Many of the above list would be perfectly suitable for roofs;\r\nin addition may be mentioned slating with flat stones, thatch, sea-weed,\r\nand wood shingles.\r\n\r\n_Straw walls_ of the following kind are very effective, and they have\r\nthe advantage of requiring a minimum of string (or substitute for\r\nstring) in their manufacture. The straw or herbage of almost any\r\ndescription is simply nipped between two pairs of long sticks, which are\r\nrespectively tied together at the two ends, and at a sufficient number\r\nof intermediate places. The whole is neatly squared and trimmed. A few\r\nof these would help in finishing the roof or walls of a house. They can\r\nbe made movable so as to suit the wind, shade, and aspect. Even the hut\r\ndoor can be made on this principle.\r\n\r\n_Malay hitch_ is the name given to a wonderfully simple way of attaching\r\ntogether wisps of straw, rods, laths, reeds, planks, poles, or anything\r\nof the kind into a secure and flexible mat; the sails used in the far\r\nEast are made in this way, and the movable decks are made of bamboos\r\njoined together with a similar but rather more complicated stitch.\r\n\r\n=Shenandoah.= A river of Virginia, United States, the largest tributary\r\nto the Potomac, drains the beautiful and fertile valley between the Blue\r\nRidge and the principal range of the Alleghanies. In the war of 1861-65,\r\nthis valley was the scene of numerous conflicts, was successively\r\noccupied by the opposing armies, and finally laid waste by Gen. Sheridan\r\nin the autumn of 1864.\r\n\r\n=Shield.= A piece of defensive armor, borne on the left arm, to ward off\r\nthe strokes of the sword and of missiles. It has been constantly used\r\nfrom ancient times, through the Middle Ages, till the invention of\r\nfire-arms. The large shield worn by the Greeks and Romans (_clipeus_)\r\nwas circular, and often ornamented with devices. Another form of shield\r\n(_scutum_) was used by the Roman heavy-armed infantry, square, but bent\r\nto encircle the body. The early shield or knightly escutcheon of the\r\nMiddle Ages was circular in outline, and convex, with a boss in the\r\ncentre; the body generally of wood, and the rim of metal. There were\r\nmany other kinds of shields, made of leather, wood, basket-work, etc.,\r\nemployed up to the introduction of fire-arms, when they became\r\npractically useless, although some savage nations employ shields at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n=Shield.= To cover, as with a shield; to cover from danger; to defend;\r\nto protect; to secure from assault or injury.\r\n\r\n=Shift.= In a military sense, to change place or station. Hence, to\r\nshift quarters.\r\n\r\n=Shiloh.= A locality in Tennessee, a few miles from Pittsburg Landing,\r\nsituated on the Tennessee River. Here on April 6-7, 1862, a great battle\r\nwas fought between the Union troops under Grant and the Confederate army\r\nunder Albert Sydney Johnston and Beauregard. The Confederates began the\r\nattack, taking the Union forces by surprise, who, after a brave\r\nresistance during the first day, were compelled to retire before the\r\nvictorious Confederates, who, however, lost their gallant chief, Gen.\r\nJohnston. The Federals having been reinforced during the night,\r\ncommenced the attack on the 7th, along the whole of the rebel line,\r\nwhich was resisted gallantly, and the field was stubbornly contested\r\nuntil about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, when the Union army regained\r\ntheir lines of the day before, and drove the enemy off the field. The\r\nConfederates retreated to Corinth. The loss of the Confederates was 1735\r\nkilled, about 8000 wounded, and 960 missing. Grant’s loss was estimated\r\nat something under this number.\r\n\r\n=Shirvan=, or =Shirwan=. A province of Russia in Asia, in the country of\r\nthe Caucasus. Shirvan formed until the 6th century a part of the\r\nmonarchy of Armenia; but was afterwards conquered by the Persians, and\r\nmade a part of that empire under Khosroo Nooshirvan, who called this\r\ncountry after his name. The rulers of Shirvan carried on many wars with\r\nPersia, over which country they repeatedly gained great advantages.\r\nFinally, in the end of the 15th century, it was completely brought under\r\nPersian sway. The Russians gradually invaded the country, and it was\r\nceded to them in 1812.\r\n\r\n=Sholapore.= Capital of the collectorate of the same name, in British\r\nIndia, in the Presidency of Bombay.

Also, that which\r\nshoots; as, a five-shooter.\r\n\r\n=Shooting-iron.= A fire-arm is sometimes so called.\r\n\r\n=Shoshones=, or =Snakes=. A tribe of North American Indians inhabiting\r\nthe country between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains, and from\r\nIdaho southward into Utah. They have generally been peaceable; but they\r\ncollided with the whites on several occasions, which resulted\r\ndisastrously for them, several of their bands being almost annihilated.\r\nTreaties were formed with them on several occasions between 1863 and\r\n1868, and attempts have been made to place them upon reservations. All\r\nthe property of a dead Shoshone is buried with him, and formerly his\r\nfavorite wife and horse were killed over the corpse. In 1870 they\r\nnumbered about 4000 souls.\r\n\r\n=Shot.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Shot.= The act of shooting; discharge of a missile weapon.

See RANK, INSIGNIA OF.\r\n\r\n=Shrapnel.= See PROJECTILE, SMOOTH-BORE PROJECTILES.\r\n\r\n=Shrewsbury.= An ancient town of England, in Shropshire, on the Severn.\r\nIt was the scene of many military events, the inhabitants always taking\r\nan active share in the various contests of the most turbulent period of\r\nEnglish history, from the conquest to the civil war. It was taken by\r\nLlewellyn the Great, prince of North Wales, in 1215, during the\r\ndisturbances between King John and the barons. The famous battle of\r\nShrewsbury, in which Henry IV., then prince of Wales, first\r\ndistinguished himself in the field, and the fiery Hotspur was slain, was\r\nfought in 1403.\r\n\r\n=Shropshire, Battle of.= In which the Britons were completely\r\nsubjugated, and Caractacus, the renowned king of the Silures, became,\r\nthrough the treachery of the queen of the Brigantes, a prisoner to the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n=Shunt Gun.= A rifled fire-arm having two sets of grooves, down one of\r\nwhich the shot is passed in loading, and along the other of which it\r\npasses out when fired, having been shunted from one set to the other,\r\nwhen at the bottom, by turning upon its axis.\r\n\r\n=Shuternaul.= In the East Indies, is a sort of arquebuse, which is fixed\r\nupon the back of a camel.\r\n\r\n=Siberia=, or =Siberi=. A vast territory in Northern Asia, belonging to\r\nRussia, and including all the Russian possessions in that continent,\r\nwith the exception of the Transcaucasian and Armenian provinces. Siberia\r\nseems to have been first made known to the Russians by a merchant named\r\nAnika Stroganoff; and soon after the conquest of West Siberia was\r\neffected by the Cossack Vassili Yermak, an absconded criminal, at the\r\nhead of a numerous band of wild followers. After Yermak’s death, in\r\n1554, the Russians pursued their conquests eastward, founding Tomsk in\r\n1604, and though they often experienced serious reverses, their progress\r\nwas rapid, the Sea of Okhotsk being reached in 1639, and Irkutsk founded\r\nin 1661. Frequent disturbances have occurred between the Russians and\r\nthe Chinese and Tartars, which have resulted in the extension southward\r\nof the Siberian boundary into Manchuria and Turkestan.\r\n\r\n=Sicarii= (_i.e._, _Assassins_). The name given by the Romans to certain\r\nsavage mountain tribes of the Lebanon, who were, like the _Thugs_ of\r\nIndia, avowed murderers by profession. In the same mountains there\r\nexisted, at the time of the Crusades, a branch of the fanatic sect\r\ncalled “Assassins,” whose habits resembled those of the Sicarii, and\r\nwhose name the Crusaders imported into Europe; but these were of Arabian\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n=Sicilian Vespers.= The name given to the massacre of the French in\r\nSicily, on the day after Easter (March 30), 1822, the signal for the\r\ncommencement of which was to be the first stroke of the vesper-bell. On\r\nthe evening of Easter Monday, the inhabitants of Palermo, enraged\r\n(according to the common story) at a gross outrage which was perpetrated\r\nby a French soldier on a young Sicilian bride, suddenly rose against\r\ntheir oppressors, the French, and put to the sword every man, woman, and\r\nchild, and did not even spare those Italians and Sicilians who had\r\nmarried Frenchmen. This example was followed by Messina and other towns,\r\nand the massacre soon became general over the island. The French were\r\nhunted like wild beasts, and dragged even from the churches, where they\r\nvainly thought themselves secure. More than 8000 of them were slain by\r\nthe Palermitans alone. This event was the final overthrow of Charles of\r\nAnjou’s domination in Sicily.\r\n\r\n=Sicily= (anc. _Sicilia_). The largest island in the Mediterranean Sea,\r\nsituated between Italy and the coast of Africa, and separated on the\r\nnortheast from Naples by the Strait of Messina; it is a province of the\r\nkingdom of Italy. It was successively occupied by the Phœnicians,\r\nGreeks, Carthaginians, and Romans. For history of the Carthaginians in\r\nSicily, see CARTHAGE. The western part of Sicily was made a Roman\r\nprovince in 241 B.C.; but after the revolt of Syracuse in the second\r\nPunic war, and the conquest of that city by Marcellus, the whole island\r\nwas made a Roman province. On the downfall of the Roman empire, Sicily\r\nformed part of the kingdom of the Ostrogoths; but it was taken from them\r\nby Belisarius in 536, and annexed to the Byzantine empire. In the 8th\r\nand 9th centuries the Saracens succeeded in conquering it. The Normans\r\nconquered the island in the 11th century under Roger Guiscard, duke of\r\nApulia. It passed successively into the hands of France (see SICILIAN\r\nVESPERS), Germany, and Spain. By the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, it was\r\ngiven to the Duke of Savoy; was added to the kingdom of Naples in 1720.\r\nThe war of 1734, however, carried on by France and Spain against\r\nAustria, transferred the crown of Naples, or, as it was subsequently\r\ntermed, of the Two Sicilies, to a branch of the royal family of Spain;\r\nit remained in their hands until the French revolution led, in 1799, to\r\nthe expulsion of the royal family from Naples. In 1815, Ferdinand IV. of\r\nNaples assumed the title of Ferdinand I. of the Two Sicilies. In 1847,\r\n1848, and 1849, the Sicilians made several attempts, in common with the\r\nNeapolitans, to rid themselves of their obnoxious monarch, Ferdinand\r\nII., but without success. The Bourbons were, however, driven from the\r\nthrone by Garibaldi in 1860, and in the same year Sicily was united to\r\nthe new kingdom of Italy. See NAPLES.\r\n\r\n=Sick and Hurt.= A board so called, to which the agents, commissaries,\r\netc., belonging to the several military hospitals in Great Britain were\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n=Sick Call.= A military call which is sounded on the drum, bugle, or\r\ntrumpet, whereby the sick men are warned to attend the hospital.\r\n\r\n=Sick-flag.= The yellow quarantine flag hoisted to prevent\r\ncommunication; whence the term of the yellow flag and yellow admirals.\r\nThere are two others,--one with a black ball, the other with a square in\r\nthe centre,--denoting plague or actual diseases.\r\n\r\n=Sick Report Book.= A book in which the names of the men who are sick in\r\na company, troop, etc., are entered, also the names of their diseases,\r\nand probable cause of same.

Its chief\r\ntown was _Sicyon_, which was destroyed by Demetrius Poliorcetes. In the\r\nPersian war the Sicyonians sent fifteen ships to the battle of Salamis,\r\nand 300 hoplites to the battle of Plætæ. In the interval between the\r\nPersian and Peloponnesian wars the Sicyonians were twice defeated and\r\ntheir country laid waste by the Athenians,--first under Tolmides in 456\r\nB.C., and again under Pericles in 454 B.C. In the Peloponnesian war they\r\ntook part with the Spartans.\r\n\r\n=Side-arms.= Such arms as are suspended by the side and attached to the\r\nperson, such as a bayonet or sword.\r\n\r\n=Sidon=, or =Zidon= (now _Saida_, or _Seida_). For a long time the most\r\npowerful, and probably the most ancient, of the cities of Phœnice. It\r\nwas the chief seat of the maritime power of Phœnice until eclipsed by\r\nits own colony, Tyre. It submitted to Shalmanezer at the time of the\r\nAssyrian conquest of Syria. In the expedition of Xerxes against Greece\r\nthe Sidonians furnished the best ships in the whole fleet. Sidon\r\nreceived the great blow to her prosperity in the reign of Artaxerxes\r\nIII. (Ochus), when the Sidonians, having taken part in the revolt of\r\nPhœnice and Cyprus, and being betrayed to Ochus by their own king\r\nTennes, burned themselves with their city, 351 B.C. It was rebuilt. On\r\nSeptember 27, 1840, the town was taken from the pasha of Egypt by the\r\ntroops of the sultan and of his allies, assisted by some ships of the\r\nBritish squadron, under Admiral Sir Robert Stopford and Commodore\r\nCharles Napier.\r\n\r\n=Siege= (Fr. _siege_, “a seat, a sitting down”). Is the sitting of an\r\narmy before a hostile town or fortress with the intention of capturing\r\nit. With certain elements, the success of a siege is beyond doubt; the\r\nresult being merely a question of time. These elements are: First, the\r\nforce of the besiegers shall be sufficient to overcome the besieged in\r\nactual combat, man to man. If this be not the case, the besieged, by a\r\nsortie, might destroy the opposing works and drive away the besiegers.\r\nThe second element is, that the place must be thoroughly invested, so\r\nthat no provisions, reinforcements, or other aliment of war can enter.\r\nThe third element is, that the besiegers be undisturbed from without.\r\nFor this it is essential that there shall not be a hostile army in the\r\nneighborhood; or if there be, that the operations of the besiegers be\r\nprotected by a covering army able to cope with the enemy’s force in the\r\nfield. The ancients executed gigantic works to produce these effects. To\r\ncomplete the investment they built a high and strong wall around the\r\nwhole fortress; and to render themselves secure from without they built\r\na similar wall, facing outwards, beyond their own position. The first\r\nwas circumvallation, the second contravallation. It was thus that Cæsar\r\nfortified himself while besieging Alexia, and maintained 60,000 men\r\nwithin his ring. In modern warfare it is considered preferable to\r\nestablish strong posts here and there round the place, and merely\r\nsentinels and videttes between. Let us now assume that a fortress of\r\ngreat strength has to be reduced, and that the force of the enemy in the\r\nvicinity has been either subdued or held in check by a covering army. By\r\nrapid movements the place is at once invested on all sides. This step\r\nconstitutes merely a blockade; and if time be of little importance, it\r\nis a sufficient operation, for hunger must sooner or later cause the\r\nfortress to surrender; but if more energetic measures are required, the\r\nactual siege must be prosecuted. Advantage is taken of any hidden ground\r\nto establish the park of artillery and the engineer’s park; or, if there\r\nbe none, these parks have to be placed out of range. The besieging force\r\nis now encamped just beyond the reach of the guns of the fortress; and\r\ntheir object is to get over the intervening ground and into the works\r\nwithout being torn to pieces by the concentrated fire of the numerous\r\npieces which the defenders can bring to bear on every part. With this\r\nview, the place is approached by a series of zigzag trenches so pointed\r\nthat they cannot be enfiladed by any guns in the fortress. In order to\r\naccommodate the forces necessary to protect the workers, the trenches at\r\ncertain intervals are cut laterally for a great length, partly\r\nencircling the place, and affording safe room for a large force with\r\nample battering material. These are called _parallels_, and they are\r\ngenerally three in number. The distance of the first parallel will\r\nincrease as small-arms become more deadly; but with smooth-bore muskets\r\nit has been usual to break ground at 600 yards from the covered way of\r\nthe fortress, while in the case of Sebastopol, ground was broken at 2000\r\nyards. The engineers having, by reconnoissances, decided the locality of\r\nthe parallel, and taken advantage of any inequalities of surface, a\r\nstrong body of men is sent to the spot soon after nightfall. The\r\nattention of the garrison is distracted by false alarms in other\r\ndirections. Half the men are armed _cap-a-pie_, and lie down before the\r\nproposed parallel; while the other half, bearing each a pick and shovel,\r\nand two empty gabions, prepare for work. Each man deposits the gabions\r\nwhere the parapet of the trench should be. He then digs down behind\r\nthem, filling the gabions with the earth dug out, and after they are\r\nfilled, throwing it over them, to widen and heighten the parapet. Before\r\ndaylight the working party is expected to have formed sufficient cover\r\nto conceal themselves and the troops protecting them. During the day,\r\nthey--being concealed from the garrison--widen and complete their\r\nparallel, making it of dimensions sufficient to allow of wagons and\r\nbodies of troops with guns passing along. During the same night other\r\nparties will have been at work at zigzags of approach from the depots\r\nout of range to the first parallel, which zigzags will be probably not\r\nless than 1000 yards in length. As a rule, the defenders will not expend\r\nammunition on the first parallel, for its extent (often several miles)\r\nwill render the probability of doing material damage extremely small.\r\nFor this reason also, the dimensions of the parapet and its solidity are\r\nof far less importance in the first parallel than in the more advanced\r\nworks of attack. The first parallel being completed, the engineers\r\nselect points near its extremities, at which they erect breastworks to\r\ncover bodies of cavalry, who are kept at hand to resist sorties from the\r\ngarrison. The length of the parallel is usually made sufficient to\r\nembrace all the works of two bastions at least. Sites are then chosen\r\nfor batteries, which are built up of fascines, gabions, sand-bags, and\r\nearth. They are placed at points in the parallel formed by the\r\nprolongation of the several faces of the bastions, ravelins, and other\r\nworks of the fortress, which faces the batteries are severally intended\r\nto enfilade by a ricochet fire. Other batteries will be formed for a\r\nvertical fire of mortars. By these means it is hoped that the traverses\r\non the hostile ramparts will be destroyed, the guns dismounted, and the\r\ndefenders dispersed, before the final approaches bring the assailants to\r\nthe covered way. The sappers will now commence their advance towards the\r\npoints, or salient angles, of the two bastions to be attacked. If,\r\nhowever, the trench were cut straight towards the fortress, its guns\r\ncould easily destroy the workmen, and enfilade the approach. To prevent\r\nthis, it is cut into short zigzags, the direction always being to a\r\npoint a few yards beyond the outmost flanking-works of the garrison. The\r\nside of each trench nearest the fortress is protected by gabions and\r\nsand-bags, as in the case of the parallel. At intervals short spurs of\r\ntrench, incipient parallels, are cut, to contain infantry, to act as\r\nguards to the sappers. The second parallel is about 300 yards from the\r\nenemy’s works, and has to be more strongly formed than the first. It\r\noften terminates in a redoubt to hold some light artillery, and a strong\r\nforce of infantry, who could assail any sortie in flank; or it may run\r\ninto the first parallel, giving easier access for troops than through\r\nthe zigzags. The second parallel is revetted with sand-bags, in which\r\nloop-holes are left for musketry. After passing the second parallel, the\r\nangles of the zigzags become more acute, to prevent enfilading. At about\r\n150 yards, certain demi-parallels are cut, and armed with\r\nhowitzer-batteries to clear the covered way, while riflemen also act\r\nfrom it. The third parallel is at the foot of the glacis. Thence the\r\nplace, after being sufficiently battered, is taken by a storming party,\r\nwho make their way over the glacis; or the covered way is topped by the\r\ndouble sap, which is a safer plan for the array generally, though much\r\nmore deadly to the sappers. When the crest of the covered way has thus\r\nbeen reached, batteries of heavy artillery will be there established,\r\nfor the purpose of breaching the walls of the ravelin and bastion; while\r\nat the same time miners will first seek to destroy the defenders’\r\ncountermines (which would otherwise be likely to send these batteries\r\ninto the air), and then will excavate a tunnel to the ditch at the foot\r\nof the counterscarp. If the breach becomes practicable, a storming party\r\nwill emerge from this tunnel or gallery, and seek to carry the opposite\r\nwork by hard fighting. If inner works still subsist, which would tear\r\nassailants to pieces, the double sap may be continued across the ditch,\r\nif a dry ditch, right up the breach, that counter-batteries may be\r\nformed. If the ditch be wet, means must be adopted for a causeway or a\r\nbridge. By these means, however obstinate may be the defense, if the\r\nbesieging force be sufficiently strong, and aid do not arrive from\r\nwithout, the ultimate success of the attack becomes certain. Vauban\r\nraised attack to a superiority above defense, first by the introduction\r\nof ricochet fire, which sweeps a whole line; and secondly by\r\noriginating parallels. Before his time, the whole attack was conducted\r\nby zigzag approaches, in which the troops actually in front could be but\r\nfew, and were therefore unable to withstand strong sorties of the\r\ngarrison, who, in consequence, frequently broke out and destroyed the\r\nworks of the besiegers, rendering a siege an operation of the most\r\nuncertain character.\r\n\r\n=Siege and Sea-coast Ammunition.= See ORDNANCE, AMMUNITION FOR.\r\n\r\n=Siege Artillery.= Is heavy ordnance used for battering purposes, and of\r\ntoo weighty a character to take the field. A siege-train of guns and\r\ntheir ponderous ammunition is usually maintained in the rear of an army,\r\nready to be brought up for use when required. See ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n=Siege Carriages.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Siege-train.= The number and kind of pieces composing a siege-train\r\nmust altogether depend on circumstances; but the following general\r\nprinciples may be observed in assigning the proportion of different\r\nkinds and calibers, and the relative quantity of other supplies, for a\r\ntrain of 100 pieces:\r\n\r\n_Guns_, about three-fifths the whole number (60); _howitzers_,\r\none-fourth (25); _mortars_, 10-inch siege, one-eighth (12), 8-inch\r\nsiege, 3; _Coehorn mortars_, in addition to the 100 pieces, 6.

Total, about 1900 horses.\r\n\r\n=Siemens-Martin Steel.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR, STEEL.\r\n\r\n=Siena=, or =Sienna=. A city of Central Italy, about 30 miles southeast\r\nfrom Florence. In the Middle Ages, Siena became one of the powerful city\r\nrepublics of Italy. It embraced the Ghibelline cause, and in conjunction\r\nwith the forces of Pisa, defeated the Tuscan Guelfs, in the memorable\r\nbattle of Monte Aperto (1206). Through intestine quarrels it was\r\nsubjugated by the emperor Charles V., and given to his son in 1555, who\r\nceded it to Cosmo of Tuscany, 1557. It was incorporated with France,\r\n1808-14.\r\n\r\n=Sierra Leone.= A district of Western Africa, situated on the Atlantic.\r\nThe British settlement of Sierra Leone was established in 1787, when 400\r\nnegroes, with 60 wives, mostly women of bad character, were removed to\r\nit from London. The settlement was attacked by the French in September,\r\n1794, and by the natives in February, 1802.\r\n\r\n=Sight.= A small piece of brass or iron fixed to a cannon or a musket,\r\nto serve as a point of direction, and to assist the eye in aiming the\r\npiece.\r\n\r\n=Sight.= To give the proper elevation and direction to by means of a\r\nsight; as, to sight a rifle or cannon. _To take sight_, to take aim; to\r\nlook for the purpose of directing a piece of artillery, or the like.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Angle of.= See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Breech-.= See BREECH-SIGHT.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Buckhorn-.= A form of rear-sight much used in sporting rifles,\r\nwhich takes its name from the curved form of the notch used. This form\r\nof notch is now attached to the Springfield rifle in use by U. S.\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Coarse.= An aim of a piece in which a considerable portion of\r\nthe front-sight covers the object.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Elevating.= The rear-sight of a small-arm, arranged to give\r\nvarying heights of sight for different ranges. There are a variety of\r\nforms. The _leaf-sight_ has a number of hinged leaves of different\r\nlengths. The one now used in the U. S. army has one hinged leaf. Up to\r\n500 yards, the elevation is given by moving the sighting-piece up a\r\ncurved incline. Above 500 yards, the leaf is turned up to the\r\nperpendicular.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Fine.= An aim in which only the summit of the front-sight is\r\nused to get the line of sight.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Front-.= The sight nearest the muzzle of a cannon or small-arm.\r\nIn military arms, it is set on a short projection which is used also as\r\nthe bayonet-stud. In cannon of old model, using the _tangent scale_, or\r\npendulum hausse, the height of the front-sight is made equal to the\r\ndispart, making the _natural line of sight_ parallel to the axis of the\r\npiece. See DISPART.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Line of.= See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Peep-.= A form of rear-sight for small-arms in which the\r\nmarksman looks through a small hole.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Plane of.= See POINTING.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Quarter-.= The quarter-sights of a cannon are divisions marked\r\non the upper quarters of the base-ring, commencing where it would be\r\nintersected by a plane parallel to the axis of the piece, and tangent to\r\nthe upper surface of the trunnions; used for giving elevations up to\r\nthree degrees, and especially for pointing at a less elevation than the\r\nnatural angle of sight. Now obsolete.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Rear-.= The sight nearest the breech of a cannon or small-arm.\r\nThe term is specially applied to small-arms.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Telescopic.= An apparatus for sighting a cannon or small-arm,\r\nconsisting of a telescope so mounted as to give varying angles of sight;\r\nused especially for long ranges. Rifles with such an attachment are\r\nsometimes called telescopic rifles.\r\n\r\n=Sight, Trunnion.= A front-sight fixed on or near the trunnions of a\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n=Sign.= An indication or token. In astronomy, one of the twelve\r\ndivisions of the zodiac.\r\n\r\n=Sign.= To affix a signature; to subscribe.\r\n\r\n=Sign Language.= A pantomimic system of communicating ideas, extensively\r\nused by North American Indians. The range of its use is not exactly\r\nknown, but it is common among all the tribes of the plains and many of\r\nthose beyond the Rocky Mountains. It is in one sense the court language\r\nof the Indians, being the only means of communication between tribes not\r\nspeaking a common dialect. According to Gen. Marcy, it is accurately\r\nused and perfectly understood by all the Indians from the Gila to the\r\nColumbia. The same author tells a remarkable story, which seems to show\r\nthat the system is very nearly, if not exactly, the same as that used in\r\nteaching mutes in deaf and dumb asylums.\r\n\r\n=Signal.= Any sign made for marching, fighting, etc. Signals are\r\nlikewise given by the drum, bugle, and trumpet, during the exercise of a\r\nbattalion. See SIGNAL SERVICE.\r\n\r\n=Signal Code.= See SIGNALING.\r\n\r\n=Signal Equipments.= See EQUIPMENTS, SIGNAL.\r\n\r\n=Signal Service.= In the U. S. army there is one chief signal-officer of\r\nthe army, with the rank, pay, and emoluments of a brigadier-general, and\r\n400 enlisted men. The chief signal-officer is assisted in his duties by\r\ncommissioned officers detailed from the line for that purpose. In war\r\ntimes the Signal Service of the U. S. army is equipped to maintain\r\ncommunications by telegraph, signals, etc., between different sections\r\nof an army or armies, or between land and sea forces. The enlisted men\r\nare thoroughly drilled in the art of field telegraphy. In peace times\r\nthe Signal Service has a corps of observers stationed in large towns,\r\nand important commercial centres, to give timely warning of the approach\r\nof storms, rise of rivers, and all other important weather news for the\r\nguidance of merchants and others.\r\n\r\n=Signaling.= Is of remote origin. A rude code of signals addressed to\r\nthe eye is common among the savage races of the present day, and\r\ndoubtless existed from the earliest times among the historical races.\r\nThe Indians of the great plains of North America avail themselves for\r\nnight-signals of fires lighted on elevated points, and of dense clouds\r\nof smoke made by suddenly heaping green brush upon a fire for\r\nday-signals. Gen. Marcy, in his “Army Life on the Border,” shows that\r\nsimilar signals can be used in this region with great advantage by\r\ntroops engaged in Indian campaigning. Messages exchanged in this way\r\nmust be preconcerted. This method of signaling dates from a remote\r\nantiquity. Alphabetical signaling--a system in which a written language\r\nis conveyed by means of its elements--is first described by Polybius,\r\nabout 260 B.C., and seems to have been devised, or at least greatly\r\nimproved by him. He formed a code by arranging the letters of the Greek\r\nalphabet in several columns. A given letter was represented by a number\r\nof lanterns or torches or other signals, which gave the number of the\r\ncolumn, and a second set of signals giving the number of the letter in\r\nthe column. Capt. John Smith, of Virginia fame, is said to have used the\r\nsystem of Polybius during the siege of Vienna. Alphabetical signaling\r\nthus early adopted remained without improvement, and too cumbersome for\r\ngeneral application till recent times. _Message signaling_ by torches,\r\nflags, and rockets has been generally used, especially at sea, where it\r\nhas a wide application both in war and commerce. The signals usually\r\nrepresented numbers, which were referred to printed codes. The invention\r\nof the magnetic telegraph led to the Morse alphabet, which crystallized\r\nthe hitherto vague idea of representing letters by the combination and\r\narrangement of a few simple elements. In the _general service code_ of\r\nthe United States, there are used two elements. These can readily be\r\nrepresented by sounds, motions, numbers, colors, etc. The ordinary\r\nmethod of signaling is by waving a flag by day and a torch at night. See\r\nalso TELEGRAPH, FIELD.\r\n\r\n=Sikh Wars.= Two brief but desperate contests waged between the British\r\npower in India and the Sikhs in 1845-46, 1848-49, which resulted in the\r\ndestruction of the latter as an independent nation. The first had its\r\norigin in the dissensions which convulsed the Sikh country after the\r\ndeath of Runjeet Singh, and which necessitated the exercise of wary\r\nregard on the part of the Calcutta authorities. At length an army of\r\nSikhs, flushed with their triumph over all lawful authority in their own\r\ncountry, crossed the Sutlej, and extended their ravages over British\r\nterritory; but their advanced guard was met by Sir Henry Hardinge, the\r\ngovernor-general, at the head of four regiments of infantry and one of\r\ndragoons, and routed at Mudki with heavy loss. Three days after, the\r\nmain body, which had in the mean time crossed the river and intrenched\r\nitself at Feroze-Shah, was attacked by a larger force of British under\r\nGough and Hardinge, and after a bloody conflict, which lasted two days,\r\nalso routed. Still undismayed by these reverses, they again intrenched\r\nthemselves at Sobraon; but a fresh body which had just crossed the\r\nSutlej at Aliwal 19,000 strong with 68 pieces of cannon, was wholly\r\nrouted and driven across the river by Sir Harry Smith, at the head of\r\n7000 men, with 32 guns; and their main body was soon after similarly\r\ndispersed at Sobraon (which see). The British then crossed the river,\r\ntook Lahore, and restored the authority of the young Maharajah from\r\nwhom they took the territory between the Beas and the Sutlej; the treaty\r\nconfirming this settlement being made at Lahore, March 9, 1846. But the\r\ninternal disturbances in the kingdom of Lahore soon became as active as\r\nbefore, and induced the Maharajah’s prime minister to put the country\r\nunder the Company’s protection; and a residency with a guard of regular\r\ntroops was then established in the capital. On April 20, 1848, two\r\nBritish officers were murdered by a Sikh chief, the dewan of Moolraj of\r\nMultan; and as it was found to be but a premonitory symptom of a general\r\noutbreak, a small force of British under Lieut. Edwardes, aided by a\r\nbody of Sikhs, under the rajah of Bhawalpur, gallantly attacked the army\r\nof Moolraj, which, after a desperate conflict of nine hours, they\r\ndefeated on June 18, and, both sides in the mean time having received\r\nreinforcements, again on July 1; Multan was then laid siege to, but the\r\ndefection of 5000 auxiliary Sikhs under Shere Singh (the son of the\r\nSirdar Chuttur Singh, the governor of Hazara, who had been for some time\r\nin revolt, and had driven the British from his district), compelled the\r\nBritish to retreat. For some time, the British authorities in the Punjab\r\nwere hampered by a want of military force, and though the Maharajah and\r\nmuch of his army still opposed the Sikh rebels, little reliance could be\r\nplaced upon most of it. Shere Singh now succeeded in raising his army to\r\n40,000, but was defeated by Lord Gough at Ramnuggur (November 22). The\r\ninconsiderate haste of Gough at Chillianwalla, January 13, nearly lost\r\nhim that great battle, which was saved only by the extreme valor of his\r\nsoldiers; but amends for this fault were made at Gujerat, where the\r\npower of Shere Singh and his allies was completely broken. Meanwhile,\r\nthe fortress of Multan had, after a protracted bombardment, been\r\ncaptured, and the Company, seeing no other mode of protecting their\r\nterritories from annoyance by these warlike fanatics, annexed the\r\nPunjab, March 29, 1849, and thus terminated the existence of the Sikhs\r\nas an independent nation.\r\n\r\n=Sikhs.= The term Sikh, a corruption of the Sanscrit _s’ishya_,\r\nsignifying “disciple,” is applied to a community of which the Punjab, in\r\nNorthern India, constitutes, substantially, the confines. Less commonly,\r\neven among themselves, the members of this community are also known as\r\nSinhs (vulgarly Singhs), that is, “Lions,” a title given them by Govind,\r\nthe last and most influential of their hierarchs. Every name of a Sikh\r\nmale now terminates with the word Sinh. Originally a body of mere\r\nreligionists, the Sikhs, from the energy which they developed under\r\nrepression, and the inducements which they offered as proselytizers,\r\ngrew by degrees, in strength and numbers, and ended in a formidable\r\nnationality. Their originator, Nanak, was born in 1469, in the vicinity\r\nof Lahore, and died in 1539, not far from the place of his nativity.\r\n\r\n=Silence.= To cause to cease firing by a vigorous cannonade; as, to\r\nsilence the batteries of an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Silesia.= A province of the kingdom of Prussia, included in the limits\r\nof the new German empire, lies south of the provinces of Brandenburg and\r\nPosen. Formerly a province of Poland; was invaded by John of Bohemia in\r\n1325; ceded to him, 1355. In 1740, Frederick II. of Prussia, taking\r\nadvantage of the helpless condition of Maria Theresa of Austria, laid\r\nclaims to certain portions of Silesia; and without declaring war,\r\nmarched into and took possession of the province, maintaining his hold\r\ndespite the utmost efforts of Austria in 1740-1742, and 1744-1745,\r\ncalled the _first_ and _second_ Silesian wars. After the _third_\r\nSilesian war, better known as the _Seven Years’ War_ (which see), it was\r\nfinally ceded (1763) to Prussia. It was overrun by the French in 1807.\r\n\r\n=Silistria.= A strongly fortified town of Bulgaria, in Turkey in Europe,\r\non the right bank of the Danube. Here in 971, the Byzantine emperor,\r\nJohn Zimisces, routed the Russians under Sviatoslav. It was taken by the\r\nRussians, June 30, 1829, and held some years by them as a pledge for the\r\npayment of a large sum of money by the Porte, but was eventually\r\nreturned. In 1854 it was again besieged by the Russians (30,000 strong),\r\nunder Prince Paskewitsch, and many assaults were made. The Russian\r\ngeneral was compelled to return in consequence of a dangerous contusion.\r\nOn June 2, Mussa Pasha, the brave and skillful commander of the\r\ngarrison, was killed. On June 9, the Russians stormed two forts, which\r\nwere retaken. A grand assault took place on June 13, under Prince\r\nGortschakoff and Gen. Schilders, which was vigorously repelled. On the\r\n15th, the garrison assumed the offensive, crossed the river, defeated\r\nthe Russians, and destroyed the siege-works. The siege was thus raised,\r\nand the Russians commenced their retreat as Omar Pasha was drawing near.\r\nThe garrison was ably assisted by two British officers, Capt. Butler and\r\nLieut. Nasmyth, the former of whom, after being wounded, died of\r\nexhaustion. They were highly praised by Omar Pasha and Lord Hardinge,\r\nand Lieut. Nasmyth made a major.\r\n\r\n=Sill.= In fortification, the inner edge of an embrasure.\r\n\r\n=Silladar Horse.= Indian irregular cavalry, raised and maintained on the\r\nprinciple of every man furnishing and maintaining his own horse, arms,\r\nequipments, etc., in return for his pay.\r\n\r\n=Sillon.= In fortification, a work raised in the middle of a ditch, to\r\ndefend it when it is too wide. It has no particular form, and is\r\nsometimes made with little bastions, half-moons, and redans, which are\r\nlower than the works of the place, but higher than the covert way. It\r\nis more frequently called an _envelope_.\r\n\r\n=Silures.= A powerful people in Britain, inhabiting South Wales, who\r\nlong offered a formidable resistance to the Romans, and were the only\r\npeople in the island who at a later time maintained their independence\r\nagainst the Saxons.\r\n\r\n=Silver Stick.= Is the title given to a field-officer of the Life\r\nGuards, when on duty at the palace. The _silver stick_ is in waiting for\r\na week, during which period all reports are made through him to the\r\n_gold stick_ (which see), and orders from the _gold stick_ pass through\r\nto the brigade. In the absence of the _gold stick_ on levees, and\r\ndrawing-room days, he goes to the royal closet for the parole.\r\n\r\n=Simancas.= A town of Spain, province of Valladolid. Near it Ramirez II.\r\nof Leon and Fernando of Castile gained a victory over Abderahman, the\r\nMoorish king of Cordova, August 6, 938. The archives of Castile are kept\r\nin the fortress of this place, and many valuable documents and records\r\nwere burnt by the French troops quartered in the town in 1809.\r\n\r\n=Simonoseki.= A town of Japan, at the southwestern extremity of the\r\nisland of Nipon, and at the entrance of the island sea Suonada. In 1863\r\nthree vessels belonging to the American, Dutch, and French governments\r\nwere fired into from batteries on the shore of Simonoseki Strait; this\r\nassault was subsequently returned by French and American war-vessels. In\r\n1864 a combined fleet of Great Britain, France, Holland, and the U. S.\r\nmen-of-war bombarded and destroyed Simonoseki. The Japanese government\r\nhad to pay an indemnity of $3,000,000.\r\n\r\n=Simulation.= The vice of counterfeiting illness or defect, for the\r\npurpose of being invalided.\r\n\r\n=Sinalunga.= A town of Central Italy, in the province of Sienna. Here\r\nGaribaldi was arrested in 1867, whilst attempting to cross into the\r\nPapal territory to take command of the volunteers who intended to march\r\nupon Rome.\r\n\r\n=Sinde=, or =Scinde=. (Called also _Sindh_, or _Sindia_, and _Sinday_,\r\nfrom _sindhoo_, or _sindhu_, “a collection of waters.”) An extensive\r\nterritory of British India, included in the presidency of Bombay,\r\ncomprising the lower course and delta of the Indus. It was traversed by\r\nthe Greeks under Alexander, about 326 B.C.; conquered by the Persian\r\nMohammedans in the 8th century; tributary to the Ghaznevide dynasty in\r\nthe 11th century; conquered by Nadir Shah, 1739; reverted to the empire\r\nof Delhi after his death, 1747. After various changes of rulers, Sinde\r\nwas conquered by the English. Sir Charles James Napier, the British\r\nenvoy, at the head of a considerable military force, marched against the\r\nenemy, totally routed them at Meeanee (February 17, 1843), and by\r\ndefeating the ameers of Mirpur, at Dubba, near Hyderabad (March 24),\r\ncompleted the subjugation of Sinde. For two years afterwards, Napier was\r\nactively employed in reducing the marauding tribes of the west, who\r\npillaged the province; and so successful was the “Sheitanka bhai”\r\n(Devil’s Brother), as the robber tribes named him, that they were\r\ncompletely rooted out of their fastnesses, and most of them transported\r\nto distant regions.\r\n\r\n=Sine Die= (“without day”). When the court or other body rise at the end\r\nof a session or term they adjourn _sine die_. In law this does not\r\npreclude further proceedings by the same court.\r\n\r\n=Single Combat.= A contest in which no more than two are engaged.\r\n\r\n=Single-stick.= A cudgel used in fencing or fighting. Also, a game at\r\ncudgels, in which he who first brings blood from his adversary’s head is\r\npronounced victor.\r\n\r\n=Sinister.= In heraldry, the left-hand side of a shield. As shields are\r\nsupposed to be carried in front of the person, the sinister side is that\r\nwhich covers the bearer’s left side, and therefore, lies to the\r\nspectator’s right. See POINTS OF THE ESCUTCHEON.\r\n\r\n=Sinopé= (Turk. _Sinub_). A town of Asiatic Turkey, province of\r\nAnatolia, on the southern side of a little promontory running eastward\r\ninto the Black Sea, 80 miles northwest of Samsun. Ancient Sinopé was the\r\nmost important of all the Greek colonies on the shores of the Euxine.\r\nHaving been destroyed in the invasion of Asia by the Cimmerians, it was\r\nrestored by a new colony from Miletus, 632 B.C. It remained an\r\nindependent state till it was taken by Pharnaces I., king of Pontus.\r\nAfter an obstinate resistance to the Romans under Lucullus, it was taken\r\nand plundered, and proclaimed a free city. The bay of Sinopé, which\r\naffords the finest anchorage for ships along the whole northern coast of\r\nAsiatic Turkey, was the scene of a bloody naval engagement, or rather\r\nmassacre, November 30, 1853, when a Turkish squadron of 13 ships was\r\nsuddenly attacked and destroyed (except one vessel which conveyed the\r\ntidings to Constantinople) by a Russian fleet of 6 sail of the line, 2\r\nsailing-vessels, and 3 steamers; 4000 lives were lost by fire or\r\ndrowning, and Osman Pasha, the Turkish admiral, died at Sebastopol of\r\nhis wounds. In consequence of this event, the Anglo-French fleet entered\r\nthe Black Sea, January 3, 1854.\r\n\r\n=Sinople.= In heraldry, the same as _Vert_ (which see).\r\n\r\n=Sinuessa.= An ancient town of Italy, on the shore of the Mediterranean,\r\nnear the confines of Latium and Campania. It was colonized by the Romans\r\nin 296 B.C. It suffered much during the invasion of Hannibal, who, in\r\n217, carried his devastations up to the very gates.\r\n\r\n=Sioux Indians.= See DAKOTA INDIANS.\r\n\r\n=Sir.= The title of a knight or baronet, which, for distinction’s sake,\r\nis always prefixed to the knight’s or baronet’s Christian name, either\r\nin speaking or in writing to him.\r\n\r\n=Siraceni=, =Siraci=, or =Siraces=. A powerful people of Sarmatia\r\nAsiatica, dwelt in the district of Siracene, east of Palus Mæotis, as\r\nfar as the river Rha (now Volga). The Romans were engaged in a war with\r\nthem in 50.\r\n\r\n=Sirmium= (now _Mitroviz_). An important city in Pannonia Inferior, was\r\nsituated on the left bank of the Savus. It was founded by the Taurisci,\r\nand under the Romans became the capital of Pannonia, and the\r\nheadquarters of all their operations in their wars against the Dacians\r\nand the neighboring barbarians. It contained a large manufactory of\r\narms, a spacious forum, an imperial palace, etc. It was the residence of\r\nthe admiral of the first Flavian fleet on the Danube, and the birthplace\r\nof the emperor Probus.\r\n\r\n=Siscia.= An important town in Pannonia Superior, situated upon an\r\nisland formed by the rivers Savus Colapis and Odra. It was a\r\nstrongly-fortified place, and was conquered by Tiberius in the reign of\r\nAugustus, from which time it became the most important town in all\r\nPannonia.\r\n\r\n=Sissopoli=, or =Sizeboli=. A town of Turkey in Europe, 80 miles\r\nnortheast from Adrianople. It was taken by the Russians in 1829.\r\n\r\n=Sistova=, or =Schistab=, called also =Shtab=. A town of Turkey in\r\nEurope, in Bulgaria, on the right bank of the Danube, 24 miles\r\neast-southeast from Nicopolis. A treaty of peace (“peace of Sistova”)\r\nwas signed here between Austria and Turkey in 1791.\r\n\r\n=Sit.= In a military sense, to take a stationary position; as, _to sit\r\nbefore a fortification_, to lie encamped for the purpose of besieging\r\nit.\r\n\r\n=Sitka.= Called by the Russians New Archangel, is the most important\r\nsettlement in Alaska. It is situated on the west side of Baranoff\r\nIsland, in lat. 57° 3′. The population is mainly composed of Indians and\r\nRussian half-breeds. A census taken in 1875 made the total number,\r\nexcluding Indians, 502. For many years Sitka was the headquarters of the\r\nRussian American Company. Upon the transfer of the Territory, in 1867,\r\nto the United States, Sitka became the headquarters of the military\r\ndepartment of Alaska. It remained an army post till 1877, when the\r\ngarrison was withdrawn. The inhabitants are at present protected from\r\nthe Indians by a naval vessel.\r\n\r\n=Sixain.= In the Middle Ages, was an order of battle, wherein six\r\nbattalions being ranged in one line, the second and fifth were made to\r\nadvance, to form the vanguard; the first and sixth to retire, to form\r\nthe rear-guard; the third and fourth remaining on the spot, to form the\r\ncorps or body of the battle.\r\n\r\n=Six-shooter.= A pistol with six barrels, or capable of firing six shots\r\nin quick succession; especially a six-barreled or six-chambered\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\n=Size, To.= In a military sense, to take the height of men for the\r\npurpose of placing them in military array, and of rendering their\r\nrelative statures more effective.\r\n\r\n=Skalitz.= A small town of Austria, in the northwest of Hungary, near\r\nthe borders of Moravia, on the left bank of the March. It was stormed by\r\nthe Prussian general Steinmetz, June 28, 1866; whereby the junction of\r\nthe divisions of the Prussians was greatly facilitated.\r\n\r\n=Skean=, =Skeen=, or =Skeine=. A Celtic word which signifies a knife. It\r\nwas a weapon in the shape of a small sword or knife, which was worn by\r\nthe Irish in ancient times.\r\n\r\n=Skedaddle.= To betake one’s self to flight; to run away with\r\nprecipitation, as if in a panic; to withdraw, as an army, or part of an\r\narmy, from the presence of an enemy, especially in a hasty or secret\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n=Skeleton.= A word applied to regiments that have become reduced in\r\ntheir number of men.\r\n\r\n=Sketch, Military.= The delineation of a small portion of ground for\r\nmilitary purposes. The scale is generally larger than that of a map.\r\n\r\n=Skid.= In military language, is any timber which is used as a base to\r\nkeep one object from resting on another. Thus, a row of cannon in store\r\nwill be kept from the ground by skids. The term is also applied to the\r\ndrag which is put on the wheels of carriages in going up hills, to\r\nprevent rolling backwards.\r\n\r\n=Skierniwice.= A town of Russia, situated on the Bzura, 38 miles\r\nsouthwest from Warsaw. The French were defeated here, in 1809, by the\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\n=Skinners.= A name assumed by a predatory band in the Revolutionary war,\r\nwho, professing allegiance to the American cause, but influenced by a\r\ndesire to plunder, roamed over the “neutral ground” lying between the\r\nhostile armies, robbing those who refused to take the oath of fidelity.\r\n\r\n=Skipton.= A town of England in the West Riding of Yorkshire, 38 miles\r\nwest of York. The old castle of Skipton was founded in the time of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror; it was a place of great strength in the 17th\r\ncentury, and held out for three years against the Parliamentary forces.\r\nIn 1649 it was dismantled, but subsequently rebuilt by the Countess of\r\nPembroke.\r\n\r\n=Skirmish.= A slight fight in war; a light combat between detachments\r\nfrom armies which are yet at a considerable distance from each other, or\r\nbetween detached and small parties.\r\n\r\n=Skirmish.= To fight slightly or in small parties; to engage in a\r\nskirmish; to act as skirmishers.\r\n\r\n=Skirmisher.= One who skirmishes; one of such troops as are sent forward\r\nin advance, or move deployed in loose order on the flanks of a marching\r\ncolumn, to discover and intercept hostile forces.\r\n\r\n=Skiver.= A dirk to stab with.\r\n\r\n=Skottefer.= Formerly a name applied to an archer.\r\n\r\n=Sky-rocket.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Slash.= A cut; a wound; also, a cut in cloth. It was formerly used to\r\nexpress the pieces of tape or worsted lace which were placed upon the\r\narms of non-commissioned officers, in order to distinguish them from\r\nprivates.\r\n\r\n=Slash.= To strike violently and at random with an edged instrument; to\r\nlay about one indiscriminately with blows.\r\n\r\n=Slashed.= Cut in stripes or lines. Hence, slashed sleeves and pockets,\r\nwhich are peculiar to the British cavalry, when the officers or men wear\r\nlong coats.\r\n\r\n=Slaughter.= The extensive and unnecessary destruction of human life;\r\ncarnage. Also, to visit with great destruction of life; to kill; to slay\r\nin battle.\r\n\r\n=Slavonia=, or =Sclavonia= (called by the native _Slavonska_). A\r\nterritory or province of the Austrian empire, formerly incorporated with\r\nHungary, but now forming part of the kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia.\r\nThe country anciently formed part of the province of Pannonia. During\r\nthe barbarian migrations, the land was overrun, now by one and now by\r\nanother tribe, and at length remained in the possession of the Avars.\r\nThese, however, were conquered about the end of the 8th century by\r\nCharlemagne, who settled in their place a tribe of Slavonians from\r\nDalmatia. When, in the 10th century, the Hungarians conquered Pannonia,\r\nthey also made themselves masters of the whole of Slavonia, except\r\nSyrmia, which still remained subject to the Eastern emperors. It was,\r\nhowever, the object of contention, and the scene of bloody conflicts\r\nbetween the Greeks and the Hungarians, until, after various\r\nvicissitudes, it was finally ceded to the latter in 1165. From 1526,\r\nwhen it was conquered by the Turks, Slavonia remained in their\r\npossession till it was restored to Hungary by the peace of Carlowitz in\r\n1699. In 1734 its size was diminished by the formation of the Military\r\nFrontier, and in 1848 it was separated from Hungary.\r\n\r\n=Slavonians=, or =Slaves= (native name _Slowene_, or _Slowane_). The\r\ngeneral name of a group of nations belonging to the Aryan family, whose\r\nsettlements extend from the Elbe to Kamtschatka, and from the Frozen Sea\r\nto Ragusa on the Adriatic, the whole of Eastern Europe being almost\r\nexclusively occupied by them. The original names of the Slavic tribes\r\nseem to have been Winds, or Wends (_Venedi_), and Serbs. The latter of\r\nthese names is spoken of by Procopius as the ancient name common to the\r\nwhole Slavic stock. The Slavonians proper are a handsome, tall, and\r\nslender race.\r\n\r\n=Sleepers.= Small joists of timber, which form the foundation for the\r\nplatform of a battery, and upon which the boards for the flooring are\r\nlaid. Also, the undermost timbers of a gun or mortar.\r\n\r\n=Sleets.= The parts of a mortar extending from the chamber to the\r\ntrunnions, to strengthen that part.\r\n\r\n=Sleeves, Gunner’s.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Sliding-rings.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, NOMENCLATURE OF ARTILLERY\r\nCARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n=Sligo.= A maritime county in the northwest of Ireland, and the province\r\nof Connaught. It formed part of the kingdom of Connaught previously to\r\nthe arrival of the English, in the reign of Henry II. Subsequently it\r\ncame into the possession of one of the family of the O’Connors, kings of\r\nConnaught, who was called O’Connor Sligo. After a protracted struggle\r\nbetween the natives and the English, it fell into the hands of the De\r\nBurgos, who either by force or treaties had made themselves masters of\r\nthe greater part of the ancient kingdom of Connaught. It became the\r\ntheatre of several conflicts in the war against O’Neil, chieftain of\r\nTyrone, in the latter part of Elizabeth’s reign. The most remarkable of\r\nthese was that with Sir Conyers Clifford, who in attempting to pass into\r\nthe country from Roscommon with a body of from 1500 to 2000 men, in\r\norder to relieve Belleek, was attacked in a defile of the Curlew\r\nMountains by O’Roark, chieftain of Breffney, was himself killed and his\r\ntroops were driven back with considerable loss. During the civil wars of\r\n1641, the Irish kept possession of the open country until nearly its\r\nclose, when they were reduced to submission by the Parliamentary forces\r\nunder Ireton. In the subsequent war of 1688 this country was held by the\r\nforces of King James for some time, but ultimately yielded to the\r\nvictorious arms of William III. The French force which landed at\r\nKillalla under Gen. Humbert in 1798, had a severe skirmish at Coloony\r\nwith the Limerick militia, commanded by Col. Vereker, afterwards\r\nViscount Gort, which ended in the retreat of the latter.\r\n\r\n=Sligo.= The chief town of the above county, and a seaport, situated on\r\nthe mouth of the river Garrogue. In 1641, it was taken without\r\nopposition, by the Parliamentarians, under Sir Charles Coote, who was\r\nafterwards attacked by a force collected by the Roman Catholic\r\narchbishop of Tuam, which retreated in consequence of an alarm being\r\nspread that a large force was approaching to relieve the town. When\r\nretiring they were attacked by the Parliamentarian forces, the\r\narchbishop killed, and on his person was found the important document\r\nexposing the secret communications which took place between Charles I.\r\nand the Irish Catholics. Coote subsequently evacuated the town, which\r\nthence continued in possession of the royalists till the termination of\r\nthe war. In 1688 it was taken for King William by the Enniskilleners,\r\nwho, in turn, were driven out by Gen. Sarsfield; but the place\r\nultimately surrendered to the Earl of Granard.\r\n\r\n=Sling.= A weapon much in use before the introduction of fire-arms,\r\nconsisted of a piece of leather, with a round hole in the middle, and\r\ntwo cords of about a yard in length. A round pebble being hung in the\r\nleather by cords, the latter were held firmly in the right hand, and\r\nswung rapidly round. When the stone had attained great speed, one string\r\nwas disengaged, on which the stone flew off at a tangent, its initial\r\nvelocity being the same as it had at the last moment of revolution. This\r\nvelocity gives far greater range and force than could be imparted in\r\nmere throwing. The men who used this weapon were called _slingers_.\r\n\r\n=Sling.= A leather strap attached to a musket, serving to support it\r\nacross the soldier’s back, as occasion may require.\r\n\r\n=Sling-cart.= See HAND SLING-CART.\r\n\r\n=Slingers.= See SLING.\r\n\r\n=Slope Arms.= A word of command in the British service, for placing the\r\nmusket upon the shoulder with the butt advanced. In marches, soldiers\r\nare almost invariably permitted to slope arms.\r\n\r\n=Slope, Interior.= See INTERIOR SLOPE.\r\n\r\n=Slopes.= The approaches to the crest of heights are by slopes, which\r\nmay be either gentle or steep. When these slopes are gentle, the fire\r\nfrom the crest can be made an effective one by reason of its “grazing\r\naction.” Especially will it be so with artillery fire when properly\r\ndirected. When slopes are quite steep, the fire will be a plunging one,\r\nand will be apt to pass over the heads of the attacking troops.\r\nEspecially will this be the case with the fire of artillery.\r\n\r\n=Sloping Swords.= In the British service, is a position of the sword\r\namong cavalry, when the back of the blade rests on the hollow of the\r\nright shoulder, the hilt advanced.\r\n\r\n=Slow Time.= The same as common time, by which troops on foot march at\r\nthe rate of ninety steps per minute.\r\n\r\n=Slow-match.= See LABORATORY STORES.\r\n\r\n=Slugs.= Cylindrical or cubical pieces of metal, discharged from a gun.\r\n\r\n=Slur-bow.= A species of cross-bow formerly used for discharging fire\r\nand arrows.\r\n\r\n=Smalcald.= See SCHMALKALD, LEAGUE OF.\r\n\r\n=Small-arms.= Are portable fire-arms known as muskets, rifles, carbines,\r\npistols, etc., and were first invented about the middle of the 14th\r\ncentury. At first they consisted simply of a tube of iron or copper,\r\nfired from a stand or support. They were loaded with leaden balls, and\r\nwere touched off by a lighted match held in the hand. They weighed from\r\n25 to 75 pounds, and consequently two men were required to serve them.\r\nThe difficulty of loading these weapons, and the uncertainty of their\r\neffects, as regards range and accuracy, prevented them from coming\r\nrapidly into use, and the cross-bow was for a long time retained as the\r\nprincipal projectile weapon for infantry. The difficulty of aiming\r\nhand-cannon, arising from their great weight, was in a measure overcome\r\nby making them shorter, and supporting them on a tripod, by means of\r\ntrunnions which rested on forks. This arm was called an _arquebuse_\r\n(which see). The next improvement in the arquebuse was to make it\r\nlighter, and inclose it in a piece of wood called the _stock_, the butt\r\nof which was pressed against the left shoulder, while the right hand\r\napplied the match to the vent. It was still very heavy, and in aiming,\r\nthe muzzle rested in the crotch of a fork placed in the ground. To give\r\nsteadiness to the aim while applying the match to the priming, a species\r\nof lock was next devised, which consisted of a lever holding at its\r\nextremity a lighted match. In firing, the lever was pressed down with\r\nthe finger until the lighted end of the match touched the priming. This\r\napparatus, known as the _serpentine_, continued in use until it was\r\nreplaced by the _wheel-lock_, which was invented in Nuremburg, in 1517.\r\n(See WHEEL-LOCK.) The _petronel_ was a wheel-lock arquebuse of larger\r\ncaliber and lighter weight than its predecessors. See PETRONEL.\r\n\r\n_Musket._--The musket was first introduced by the Spaniards, under\r\nCharles V. The original caliber of the musket was such that 8 round\r\nbullets weighed a pound; the piece was, consequently, so heavy that it\r\nwas necessary to fire it from a forked rest inserted in the ground. The\r\nsize of the bore was finally reduced to 18 bullets to the pound; and\r\nfrom this arm was derived the late smooth-bored rifle.\r\n\r\n_Rifle._--It is generally stated that the rifle was invented by Gaspard\r\nZoller, of Vienna, and that it first made its appearance at a\r\ntarget-practice at Leipsic, in 1498. The first rifle-grooves were made\r\nparallel to the axis of the bore, for the purpose of diminishing the\r\nfriction of loading forced or tightly-fitting bullets. It was\r\naccidentally discovered, however, that spiral grooves gave greater\r\naccuracy to the flight of the projectile, but the science of the day was\r\nunable to assign a reason for this superiority, and the form, number,\r\nand twist of the grooves depended on the caprice of individual\r\ngunmakers. About 1600, the rifle began to be used as a military weapon\r\nfor firing spherical bullets. In 1729, it was found that good results\r\ncould be attained by using oblong projectiles of elliptical form. The\r\ngreat difficulty, however, of loading the rifle, which was ordinarily\r\naccomplished by the blows of a mallet on a stout iron ramrod, prevented\r\nit from being generally used in regular warfare. The improvements which\r\nhave been made of late years have entirely overcome this difficulty, and\r\nrifles have now superseded the smooth-bored arms.\r\n\r\n_Muzzle-loading Guns._--The following are among the most prominent\r\nmuzzle-loading guns in use prior to 1860:\r\n\r\n_The Lancaster Elliptic Rifle._--So called, although the elliptical\r\nrifle is very old. The bore in this rifle is slightly oblate; the twist\r\nfound, by experience, to be most advantageous is one turn in 52 inches,\r\nthe approved diameter of the bore .498 inch, the length of the barrel\r\nbeing 32 inches. An eccentricity of .01 inch in half an inch is found\r\nsufficient to make the bullet spin on its axis to the extreme verge of\r\nits flight. The length of the bullet found to answer best with these\r\nrifles is 2¹⁄₄ diameters in length, with a windage of four- or\r\nfive-thousandths of an inch.\r\n\r\n_Nuthall’s Rifle._--In the ordinary mode of grooving rifles, sharp\r\nangles are left between the groove and “land” (those parts of the\r\nsmooth-bore left in their original state after the process of grooving\r\nhas been completed). These create great friction with the projectile,\r\nboth in loading and discharging. Maj. Nuthall removes these objections\r\nby rounding off the “lands” into the grooves, that is, making them a\r\nseries of convex and concave curves, the bore assuming a beautiful\r\nappearance to the eye, for the smoothness and evenness with which the\r\nlands and grooves blend into each other.\r\n\r\n_Enfield Rifle._--This rifle has three grooves, taking one complete turn\r\nin 78 inches, firing a bullet resembling the Minié, except that a wooden\r\ncup was substituted for one of iron. Its diameter is .577 of an inch,\r\nits bullet weighs 530 grains, and ranges with great accuracy for 800\r\nyards, and fairly up to 1100. There are also Gen. Boileau’s rifle, and\r\nsome others which our space will not admit of our noticing. The\r\nextraordinary efficacy of the breech-loading principles, especially in\r\ncombination, have, however, only been very prominent during the wars of\r\nthe last few years, and notably in the Prussian campaign of 1864 against\r\nDenmark, and of 1866 against Austria. The successes of the Prussian arms\r\nwere attributed in no small degree to the rapidity with which their\r\ntroops could fire as compared with the enemy. They had in greater or\r\nless numbers borne these same rifles since 1835, but these were the\r\nfirst opportunities of using them in warfare. To all other powers, whose\r\nmen still carried muzzle-loading rifles, and who had debated, without\r\npractical result, for years past the question of armament with\r\nbreech-loaders, soldiers thus armed appeared irresistible. From July,\r\n1866, to the present moment, the hammer and the anvil have been busy\r\nthroughout the civilized world in making the weapons of death yet more\r\ndeadly. Scarcely two countries seem to have adopted the same plan: each\r\nnation has elaborated a system from among its own inventors. Those\r\npossessing no great reserve of rifles have prepared new arms, but the\r\nmajority of governments have been content, in the first instance, to\r\nconvert their existing stock into needle-firing breech-loaders of as\r\ngood a construction as circumstances would permit. The advantage of\r\nbreech-loading is obvious: to be able to insert the charge at the head\r\nof the barrel instead of at its mouth, is to save time and avoid\r\nexposure to hostile fire during the operation of loading and ramming\r\nhome, which of necessity involves considerable outstretching of the\r\nlimbs. The great condition of success is, that the bullet shall be\r\npropelled with equal force and with equal safety to the rifleman, as\r\nfrom the muzzle-loader. When a charge is ignited the constituents of the\r\ngunpowder, assuming a gaseous condition under the heat engendered,\r\nexpand into a volume of light gas many times greater in bulk than the\r\npowder before occupied. On the amount of this expansion, and its sudden\r\naction on the projectile, the force of the shot depends. Any joint in\r\nthe breech-piece through which a portion of this gas can escape, without\r\nhaving imparted its thrust to the ball, tends, therefore, to lessen the\r\nrange and penetration; while the shock of the explosion falling more\r\nseverely on this than on any other part of the barrel, tends yet more to\r\ndislocate the breech-piece and diminish the closeness of the joint’s\r\nfit. In weapons which do not call for a long range, as revolvers and\r\npistols, a perceptible interval is left between the chamber and barrel,\r\nthrough which much gas escapes; but in rifles, which have range and\r\npenetration as principal objects, there is _prima facie_ ground for\r\npreferring a muzzle-loader. The gas, however, is far from pure as\r\ngenerated in the barrel, for much water is produced and held in\r\nsuspension, while there is also a solid residuum consisting of unburned\r\nmaterials of the powder. In the muzzle-loader, these clog (or,\r\ntechnically, foul) the barrel, filling the grooves and rendering the\r\nramming home of succeeding charges more and more difficult. The effect\r\nis, that a solid mass of unburned matter is gradually forced by ramming\r\ninto the head of the barrel, destroying the accuracy and usefulness of\r\nthe weapon. In the breech-loader, this solid deposit must be provided\r\nagainst both ways. The backward throw on firing (for, of course, the\r\ncharge explodes with equal power in every direction) tends to force it\r\ninto the mechanism of the joints, preventing their proper fit, and\r\ncontinually augmenting the escape of gas. On the other hand, the deposit\r\nis prevented from accumulating in the barrel by the fact that succeeding\r\ncharges are inserted behind it, and, by their explosion, force the solid\r\nmatters out at the muzzle. Thus, in the matter of fouling, if the gases\r\ncan be prevented from blocking up the breech-apparatus, the\r\nbreech-loader has a great advantage over the muzzle-loader. This\r\nprotection of the breech-apparatus is the problem which inventors have\r\nhad to solve. The following are the most notable among breech-loading\r\narms:\r\n\r\nThe American _Springfield_, model of 1873. The barrel is of “low steel,”\r\ncaliber .45 inch, rifled with three concentric grooves of equal widths\r\nwith the lands, and of the uniform depth of .005 of an inch, and uniform\r\ntwist of one complete turn in 22 inches. The _lock-plate_ is 0.175 inch\r\nthick, and let in flush. The exterior metal-work is browned. An open\r\nswivel is attached to the upper band, for stacking arms, instead of\r\nlocking bayonets, us heretofore; also a “trowel bayonet” and\r\n“intrenching tool.” Length of rifle-barrel including receiver, 36\r\ninches; carbine, 25.4 inches. Length of rifle-bayonet, 18 inches; crook\r\nof stock, 2¹⁄₂ inches, and distance from butt to trigger, 13¹⁄₂ inches.\r\nTotal length of rifle, without bayonet, 51.9; of carbine, 41.3 inches;\r\nweight of rifle without bayonet, 8.38 pounds; of carbine, 6.87 pounds.\r\nTrigger adjusted to pull at 6 to 8 pounds.\r\n\r\n_Remington._--This is a magazine-gun, and belongs to that system in\r\nwhich a fixed chamber is closed by a bolt, by direct action, and in\r\nwhich the lock is concealed. The magazine is in the tip-stock, and\r\ncarries 8 cartridges, which are brought into the chamber by the action\r\nof the trigger; the mechanism is so arranged that no more than one\r\ncartridge can enter the chamber at the same time. The magazine is loaded\r\nfrom below, and in any position of the bolt.\r\n\r\n_Sharps._--See SHARPS RIFLE.\r\n\r\n_Spencer._--A magazine-gun, holding 7 cartridges which are brought one\r\nby one into the chamber by a movement of the trigger-guard as a lever,\r\nwhich at the same time throws out the shell of the exploded cartridge. A\r\nnew magazine can be inserted whenever the cartridges have been\r\nexhausted, or the magazine may be shut off and the rifle used as a\r\nsingle breech-loader.\r\n\r\n_Winchester._--Same pattern as the Spencer.\r\n\r\n_Snider Rifle._--So called from its inventor, the essential features of\r\nwhich are that the breech-block revolves around an axis on the right of\r\nand parallel to the axis of the bore, and the firing-pin passes\r\nobliquely from the nose of the hammer, through the breech-block, to the\r\ncentre of the base of the cartridge. This was the first form of\r\nbreech-loaders adopted by the British government, which in 1866 directed\r\nthat the old Enfield muzzle-loaders should be altered to breech-loaders\r\nupon this system.\r\n\r\n_Martini-Henry._--Adopted by the British government, has a\r\nbreech-loading apparatus on the Martini system united to a barrel rifled\r\non the system of Henry, a gunmaker of Scotland. Martini, a Swiss,\r\nderived his system of breech-loading from the Peabody system of the\r\nUnited States by dispensing with the independent outside lock and\r\nsubstituting therefor a spiral-spring firing-bolt or striker, inclosed\r\nin the breech-block; the number of grooves is seven; in shape they are\r\nflat at the bottom; the lands are narrow, having the appearance of sharp\r\nribs, which are designed to take a firm hold of the bullet. It is\r\nunderstood that these grooves are made somewhat deeper at the breech\r\nthan at the muzzle. The twist is one turn in 22 inches. There is a brass\r\ncollar around the head of the ramrod to prevent injury to the bore in\r\nwiping out. The weight of the rifle is 8¹⁄₂ pounds; of bayonet 14¹⁄₂\r\nounces. The weight of rifle with bayonet attached 9 pounds 11 ounces.\r\n\r\n_Mauser Rifle._--This rifle is used in Prussia, and is a modification\r\nof the Chassépot system, by which it is adapted to the use of the\r\nmetallic gas-check cartridge. It was invented in 1871. The mechanism of\r\nthis gun is much simpler than the needle-gun, and has a longer range.\r\n\r\n_Chassépot Rifle._--The Chassépot rifle is used in France, and was\r\nintroduced shortly after the Austro-Prussian war of 1866. In its\r\nprincipal features it resembled the Prussian needle-gun, inasmuch as the\r\nbreech was closed with a sliding-bolt, and it fired a self-primed\r\npaper-case cartridge, which was ignited by a needle impelled by a spiral\r\nspring. Unlike the needle-gun, however, it was provided with a\r\ngas-check, which was of the form of a thick india-rubber disk or\r\npacking, attached to the end of the breech-bolt, and it possessed the\r\nmodern improvements of reduced caliber and rapid twist of the\r\nrifle-grooves for obtaining great range and accuracy of fire. The\r\nChassépot was the principal arm used by the French army during the\r\nGerman war. Since that time efforts have been made to adapt it to fire\r\nthe modern metallic-case cartridge. The plan of alteration to this end\r\nadopted by the French authorities is that submitted by Capt. Gras of the\r\nFrench artillery committee. The length of the bore, including the\r\nchamber, is 32.28 inches; the length of the complete arm, without\r\nsabre-bayonet, is 50.8 inches; and with the bayonet it is about 72.0\r\ninches. The weight with the bayonet is 10.3 pounds; without the bayonet,\r\n8.9 pounds. The grooves are four in number, and of a width equal to that\r\nof the lands; the depth of the grooves is 0.0118 inch; the twist is one\r\nturn in 21.6 inches, and is from right to left instead of from left to\r\nright, according to the usual practice. The pull on the trigger is\r\nthought to disturb the aim by carrying the muzzle of the arm slightly to\r\nthe right; the object of grooving the barrel to the left is to correct\r\nthis disturbance by the drift which follows the direction of the twist.\r\nThe initial velocity is stated to be 420 metres (about 1377 feet), and\r\nthe effective range extends to 1700 yards, about one mile. The rapidity\r\nof fire is 15 times per minute. The Russian army is armed with two\r\npatterns of _Berdan_ breech-loaders. One lot of 30,000, in which the\r\nbreech-block swings upward and forward, was manufactured by the Colt’s\r\nPatent Fire-Arms Company, Hartford, Conn., and a second lot of 30,000 on\r\na sliding breech-bolt system made in Birmingham, England. The\r\nlatter-named arm was adopted for the entire Russian army. The following\r\nare the principal dimensions: Diameter of bore (caliber), 0.42 inch;\r\nlength of barrel, 30.43 inches; total length of arm without bayonet,\r\n50.38 inches; length of arm with bayonet, 70.38 inches; number of\r\ngrooves, 6; twist, one turn in 20 inches; weight of arm with bayonet,\r\n9.75 pounds.\r\n\r\n_Vetterlin Rifle._--Is a repeating rifle used in the Swiss service, and\r\nis a Swiss invention, the peculiarity of which is the union of a\r\ncartridge magazine with a sliding-bolt-breech system. The following are\r\nthe principal dimensions: Caliber, 0.41 inch; number of grooves, 4;\r\ndepth of grooves, 0.0086 inch; width of grooves, 0.0177 inch; twist of\r\ngrooves, 26 inches; length of barrel, 33.14 inches; length of arm\r\nwithout bayonet, 51.18 inches; length of arm with bayonet, 70.08 inches;\r\nweight of arm without bayonet, 10.14 pounds; with bayonet, 11.02; weight\r\nof rifle with magazine filled, 12.12 pounds; initial velocity, 1341\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n_Werndl Rifle._--Adopted in the Austrian service in place of the\r\nalteration of Wanzl, is the invention of Joseph Werndl, a gun\r\nmanufacturer of Styria, and is applied to muskets, carbines, and\r\npistols. The breech-block in this system vibrates around an axis\r\nparallel to and below the axis of the bore prolonged to the rear of the\r\nchamber. The barrel of the musket is made of cast steel. Its length is\r\n33.14 inches, including the chamber, which is 2.07 inches. Its weight is\r\n3.83 pounds. The rifle-grooves are six in number, and their depth is\r\n0.007 inch. The lands are 0.07 inch wide, and the grooves 0.15 inch. The\r\ntwist is one turn in 28.5 inches. The total length of arm, including\r\nsabre-bayonet, 73.0 inches, while its weight, including the bayonet, is\r\nabout 11.5 pounds; without the bayonet the length is 50.5 inches, and\r\nthe weight 9.85 pounds. The barrel, bands, and sights are browned.\r\n\r\n_Werder Rifle._--Adopted in 1869 for the Bavarian army, is the invention\r\nof J. L. Werder of Nuremberg, and is known as the Werder system. It\r\nbelongs to the class of falling breech-blocks, of which the Peabody may\r\nbe considered the exponent in this country. It differs, however, from\r\nthis and most other guns of this class, as the breech-block is opened\r\nand closed by the hammer instead of the lever-guard, giving, as claimed,\r\ngreater safety and ease of manipulation, especially when the soldier\r\nloads lying on the ground. The rifle-grooves are four in number, their\r\ndepth is 0.0075, and twist is one turn in 22 inches. The diameter of the\r\nbore is 0.435; the length of the barrel, including chamber, but\r\nexclusive of breech-frame, is 35.0; the weight of the arm without\r\nbayonet, 9.75 pounds. The breech-loaders with and without the\r\nneedle-arrangement are too numerous to mention, but the most notable are\r\ngiven above. See MAGAZINE GUNS, and LYMAN’S MULTI-CHARGE GUN.\r\n\r\n_Revolver._--In fire-arms, is a weapon which, by means of a revolving\r\nbreech, or revolving barrels, can be made to fire more than once without\r\nreloading. The invention is very far from new, specimens, with even the\r\npresent system of rotation, being still in existence, which were\r\nmanufactured at the beginning of the 17th century. Probably the first\r\nrevolver to suggest itself was one in which several barrels were mounted\r\non an axis, and made to revolve by the action of the trigger, so that\r\ntheir powder-pans came successively under the action of the lock. This\r\nprinciple was never entirely abandoned, and in the reign of George IV.\r\nwas produced a pistol called the “Mariette,” which had from 4 to 24\r\nsmall barrels bored in a solid mass of metal, made to revolve as the\r\ntrigger was drawn back. At close quarters, such a pistol would doubtless\r\nhave been useful; but its great weight and cumbrous mechanism rendered\r\naim extremely unsteady. Contemporaneously from the first with the\r\nrevolving barrels, went the formation of a revolving chamber or breech,\r\npierced with several cylindrical apertures to receive the charges. Being\r\nmade to revolve, each motion brought a chamber into line with the one\r\nbarrel, common to all, whereupon the weapon was ready for use. Numerous\r\npatents for this principle have been taken out, including one by the\r\ncelebrated Marquis of Worcester in 1661. Various improvements were made,\r\nespecially in the mode of causing revolution; an American patented such\r\na weapon in the United States and England about 1818. In 1835, Col.\r\nSamuel Colt brought to a conclusion experiments of some years’ standing,\r\nand patented his world-renowned Colt’s revolver, which was a great\r\nadvance on all previous attempts, and is substantially still in use. The\r\nfame attached to Colt’s revolvers renders them so well known as to\r\nrequire but little introduction necessary. This make is now extensively\r\nused in the United States, and indeed in almost every country of the\r\nworld, and seems not to lose favor anywhere. The barrel is rifle-bored.\r\nThe lever-ramrod renders wadding or patch unnecessary, and secures the\r\ncharge against moisture, or becoming loose by rough handling or hard\r\nriding. The hammer, when at full cock, forms the sight by which to take\r\naim, and is readily raised at full cock by the thumb, with one hand. The\r\nmovements of the revolving chamber and hammer are ingeniously arranged\r\nand combined. The breech, containing six cylindrical cells for holding\r\nthe powder and ball, moves one-sixth of a revolution at a time; it can\r\nonly be fired when the chamber and the barrel are in a direct line. The\r\nbase of the cylinder being cut externally into a circular ratchet of six\r\nteeth (the lever which moves the ratchet being attached to the hammer);\r\nas the hammer is raised in the act of cocking, the cylinder is made to\r\nrevolve, and to revolve in one direction only; while the hammer is\r\nfalling the chamber is firmly held in position by a lever fitted for the\r\npurpose; when the hammer is raised the lever is removed, and the chamber\r\nis released. So long as the hammer remains at half-cock, the chamber is\r\nfree and can be loaded at pleasure. Col. Colt has improved on this\r\npatent. Revolvers made by Remington, Smith & Wesson, Daw, Adams & Dean,\r\nand others, are mostly on the same principle as the Colt.\r\n\r\n=Smart-money.= In England, the money which was paid by the person who\r\nhad taken the enlisting money, in order to get released from an\r\nengagement entered into previous to a regular enlistment. Also, money\r\nallowed to soldiers or sailors in the British service for wounds or\r\ninjuries received.\r\n\r\n=Smite.= To destroy the life of by beating, or by weapons of any kind;\r\nto slay by a blow; to kill; as, to smite one with the sword, or with an\r\narrow or other weapon. Also, to beat or put to rout in battle; to\r\ndestroy or overthrow by war.\r\n\r\n=Smoke-ball.= Is a hollow sphere similar to a light-ball, and filled\r\nwith a composition which emits a dense, nauseous smoke; it is employed\r\nto suffocate the enemy’s miners when at work, or to conceal one’s own\r\noperations; it burns from 25 to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n=Smolensk.= A fortified town of Russia, capital of the government of the\r\nsame name, 250 miles west-southwest from Moscow. The French in a most\r\nsanguinary engagement here were three times repulsed, but ultimately\r\nsucceeded in entering Smolensk, and found the city which had been\r\nbombarded burning and partly in ruins, August 16-17, 1812. Barclay de\r\nTolly, the Russian commander-in-chief, incurred the displeasure of the\r\nemperor Alexander because he retreated after the battle, and Kutusoff\r\nsucceeded to the command.\r\n\r\n=Smooth-bore Projectile.= See PROJECTILE, SPHERICAL PROJECTILES.\r\n\r\n=Smyrna.= One of the most ancient and important cities of Asia Minor,\r\nand the only one of the Greek cities on the western coast which has\r\nretained its name and importance to the present day. At an early period\r\nit fell into the hands of the Ionians of Colophon; it became a member of\r\nthe Panionic Confederacy. Its early history is obscure; but thus much is\r\nclear, however, that at some period the old city of Smyrna, which stood\r\non the northeast side of the Hermaean Gulf (now the Gulf of Smyrna), was\r\nabandoned, and that it was succeeded by a new city, on the southeast\r\nside of the same gulf (the present site), which is said to have been\r\nbuilt by Antigonus. It had a magnificent harbor, the largest ships could\r\nlie alongside the quays. In the civil wars it was taken and partly\r\ndestroyed by Dolabella, but it soon recovered. In the successive wars\r\nunder the Eastern empire it was frequently much injured, but always\r\nrecovered. After various vicissitudes during the Middle Ages, the city\r\nfell finally into the hands of the Turks, in whose possession it has\r\nsince remained.\r\n\r\n=Snaffle-bit.= A kind of slender bit, having a joint in the part to be\r\nplaced in the mouth.\r\n\r\n=Snaphance.= An old musket of the 17th and first half of the 18th\r\ncenturies, called also _asnaphan_. See GUN.\r\n\r\n=Snare-drum.= The smaller, common military drum, as distinguished from\r\nthe bass-drum;--so called because (in order to render it more resonant)\r\nthere is stretched across its lower head a catgut string, or collection\r\nof strings.\r\n\r\n=Snick and Snee.= A combat with knives such as the Dutch carry.\r\n\r\n=Snider Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Soanes.= A powerful people of the Caucasus, governed by a king who\r\ncould bring 200,000 soldiers into the field. They are also called Suani\r\nand Suanocolchi.\r\n\r\n=Sobraon.= A town of Northwest India, on the left bank of the Sutlej, 25\r\nmiles east-northeast of Ferozpur (or Ferozepoore), near which, on\r\nFebruary 10, 1846, a most obstinate battle was fought between the\r\nBritish army under Sir Hugh Gough and a Sikh force numbering about\r\n35,000. The Sikhs were strongly intrenched, and vigorously resisted the\r\nattacks of their opponents, but the courage and perseverance of the\r\nlatter ultimately gave them the mastery; the various earthworks were\r\ncaptured in succession, and the Sikhs driven across the Sutlej, with a\r\nloss in killed, wounded, and drowned of 13,000. Gough immediately\r\nfollowed up his victory by crossing into the Punjab in pursuit of the\r\nfleeing enemy.\r\n\r\n=Social War.= A celebrated contest between the Socii of Italy and the\r\ncity of Rome, which lasted from 91 B.C. till 89, and was the most\r\nformidable war ever carried on in Italy during the dominion of the\r\nRomans. It arose from the desire of the Italians to be placed on a\r\nfooting of equality with the Romans. Nearly 300,000 lives were\r\nsacrificed in the contest, and numerous towns destroyed. The senate of\r\nRome were at length compelled to grant the franchise and all other\r\nprivileges, which they at first absolutely refused to the Italians.\r\n\r\n=Socket.= Generally means any hollow pipe that receives something\r\ninserted.\r\n\r\n=Socket of a Bayonet.= The round hollow near the bent or heel of a\r\nbayonet, into which the muzzle of a fire-arm is received when the\r\nbayonet is fixed.\r\n\r\n=Sogdiana.= The northeastern province of the ancient Persian empire,\r\nseparated on the south from Bactriana and Margiana by the upper course\r\nof the Oxus; on the east and north from Scythia by the Sogdii Comedarum\r\nand Oxii Mountains, and by the upper course of the Iaxartes, and bounded\r\non the northwest by the great deserts east of the Sea of Aral. It was\r\nconquered by Cyrus, and afterwards by Alexander. After the Macedonian\r\nconquest it was subject to the kings, first of Syria and then of\r\nBactria, till it was overrun by the barbarians. The natives of the\r\ncountry were a wild, warlike people of the great Arian race, resembling\r\nthe Bactrians in their character and customs.\r\n\r\n=Soissons= (anc. _Noviodunum_, subsequently _Augusta Suessonum_). A town\r\nof France, in the department of Aisne, on the banks of the river Aisne,\r\nabout 65 miles northeast of Paris. It was subdued by Julius Cæsar, 57\r\nB.C.; held by Syagrius, after his father Ægidius, till his defeat by\r\nClovis, 486.\r\n\r\n=Solaks.= Were bowmen or archers belonging to the personal guard of the\r\ngrand seignor. They were always selected from the most expert bowmen\r\nthat were among the Janissaries. Their only arms were the sabre, bow,\r\nand arrows.\r\n\r\n=Soldan.= The title of the lieutenant-generals of the caliphs, which\r\nthey bore in their provinces and armies. These officers afterwards made\r\nthemselves sovereigns. Saladin, general of the forces of King Noureddin\r\nof Damascus, was the first that took upon him this title in Egypt, 1165,\r\nafter having killed the caliph Caym.\r\n\r\n=Soldier.= Is one who enters into an obligation to some chieftain or\r\ngovernment to devote for a specified period his whole energies, and even\r\nif necessary his life itself, to the furtherance of the policy of that\r\nchief or government. The consideration may be immediate pay, or\r\nprospective reward; or the contract may be merely an act of loyal\r\ndevotion. The acknowledgment of the service by the employer constitutes\r\nthe man a recognized soldier, and empowers him to take life in open\r\nwarfare, without being liable to the penalties of an assassin and a\r\nrobber. The fact of being mercenary--that is, of receiving wages for\r\nkilling and being killed--does not render a soldier’s trade less\r\nhonorable. He bears arms that others may be able to do without them; he\r\nis precluded by the exigencies of military training from maintaining\r\nhimself by peaceful occupation; and it is therefore but fair that those\r\nwhom he protects should support him, and give him, over and above actual\r\nmaintenance, reasonable wages for the continual risk of his life. If a\r\nman willingly enlist himself as a soldier in what he believes to be an\r\nunrighteous cause, it is an act of moral turpitude; but when once\r\nenlisted, the soldier ceases to be morally responsible for the justice\r\nor iniquity of the war he wages; that rests with his employer.\r\nObedience, implicit and entire, is his sole virtue. The maxim is, “The\r\nmilitary force never deliberates, but always obeys.” _Brother soldier_\r\nis a term of affection which is commonly used by one who serves under\r\nthe same banners, and fights for the same cause, with another. In a more\r\nextensive signification, it means any military man with respect to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n=Soldier of Fortune.= During the frequent wars which occurred in Italy,\r\nbefore the military profession became so generally prevalent in Europe,\r\nit was usual for men of enterprise and reputation to offer their\r\nservices to the different states that were engaged. They were originally\r\ncalled _condottieri_, or leaders of reputation. They afterwards extended\r\ntheir sphere of action, and under the title of _soldiers of fortune_,\r\nsought for employment in every country or state that would pay them.\r\n\r\n=Soldiering.= The estate of being a soldier; the occupation of a\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n=Soldierly.= Like, or becoming, a real soldier; brave; martial; heroic;\r\nhonorable.\r\n\r\n=Soldiers’ Friend.= A term in the military service which is generally\r\napplied to such officers as pay the strictest attention to their men;\r\ngranting them reasonable indulgences without injuring the service;\r\nseeing their wants relieved; and, above all things, enforcing just\r\ndealings and the most prompt settlements. There is much confidence in\r\nthe multitude when they are justly dealt by, and every soldier fights\r\nwell under the guidance of a soldiers’ friend.\r\n\r\n=Soldiers’ Homes.= In the United States, are homes of a permanent\r\ncharacter established by the general government for the benefit of old\r\nsoldiers, or men who were disabled in the military service of their\r\ncountry. The “Soldiers’ Home,” which is situated about 3¹⁄₂ miles from\r\nthe Capitol of Washington, was founded in compliance with provisions of\r\nact of Congress dated March 3, 1851. It contains about 470 acres, some\r\nof which is cultivated for garden produce, flowers, etc., and the\r\nremainder forms a magnificent park. In 1848, Gen. Scott forwarded to the\r\nSecretary of War the sum of $118,791.19, levied on Mexico during the war\r\nwith that country, for the benefit of the soldiers of the U. S. army,\r\nand he requested that this amount might be set aside for the\r\nconstruction of an army asylum. The following funds are also set apart\r\nfor the maintenance of the “Soldiers’ Home”: All stoppages or fines\r\nadjudged against soldiers by sentence of courts-martial, over and above\r\nany amount that may be due for the reimbursement of government or\r\nindividuals; all forfeitures on account of desertion; and all moneys\r\nbelonging to the estate of deceased soldiers, which are now or may\r\nhereafter be unclaimed for the period of three years subsequent to the\r\ndeath of said soldier or soldiers, to be repaid by the commissioners of\r\nthe institution, upon the demand of the heirs or legal representatives\r\nof the deceased; also the sum of 12¹⁄₂ cents per month is stopped from\r\nevery non-commissioned officer, musician, artificer, and private of the\r\nU. S. army. The following persons, members of the “Soldiers’ Home,” are\r\nentitled to the rights and benefits of the institution, viz.: Every\r\nsoldier of the army of the United States who has served, or may serve,\r\nhonestly and faithfully, twenty years in the same, and every discharged\r\nsoldier, who has suffered by reason of disease or wounds incurred in the\r\nservice and in the line of his duty, rendering him incapable of further\r\nmilitary service, if such disability has not been occasioned by his own\r\nmisconduct. No deserter, mutineer, or habitual drunkard is received into\r\nthe institution without such evidence of subsequent service, good\r\nconduct, and reformation of character as the commissioners may deem\r\nsufficient to authorize his admission. There are three commissioners\r\ndesignated to administer the affairs of the asylum, namely, the\r\ncommissary-general of subsistence, the surgeon-general, and the\r\nadjutant-general, whose duty it is to examine and audit the accounts of\r\nthe treasurer quarter-yearly, and to visit and inspect the “Home” at\r\nleast once in every month. The officers of the institution consist of a\r\ngovernor, a deputy governor, and a secretary and treasurer, who, with a\r\nmedical officer, are detailed from the active or retired list of the\r\narmy. Inmates of this institution receive a small allowance of\r\npocket-money per month, and they are also paid for any labor they can\r\nperform. About $8 per month is allowed to old soldiers, who, having\r\nfamilies, are permitted to live elsewhere than at the “Home.” There was\r\nalso incorporated by the act of Congress dated March 3, 1865, “the\r\nNational Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers,” which consists of the\r\ncentral asylum, at Dayton, Ohio, the eastern branch at Augusta, Me., and\r\nthe northwestern branch at Milwaukee, Wis. This asylum is kept up by\r\nannual appropriations of Congress. There are similar institutions for\r\nold and disabled soldiers in Europe. See ASYLUM, ROYAL MILITARY, and\r\nHÔTEL DES INVALIDES.\r\n\r\n=Soldiers’ Thigh.= When tight breeches were worn in the British army,\r\nthe term had its peculiar military application, from the notorious\r\npoverty of army men. _Soldiers’ thigh_ figuratively meant an empty\r\npurse; or speaking familiarly, a pair of breeches that sit close and\r\nlook smooth, because the pockets have nothing in them.\r\n\r\n=Soldiership.= A term which is rarely used; it means military qualities;\r\nmilitary character or state; martial skill; behavior becoming a soldier.\r\n\r\n=Soldiery.= A body of soldiers collectively considered; the military. “A\r\ncamp of faithful soldiery.”\r\n\r\n=Solduriers= (_Fr._). A term anciently used among the French, to signify\r\nthose persons who attached themselves to some particular general or\r\nmilitary knight, whose fortunes they followed, in consequence of being\r\npaid and supported by him.\r\n\r\n=Sole.= The bottom or lower surface of an embrasure.\r\n\r\n=Solferino.= A village of Northern Italy, province of Brescia, 20 miles\r\nnortheast from Mantua. Here, in 1796, the French conquered the\r\nAustrians, and on June 24, 1859, it was again the scene of an\r\noverwhelming victory obtained by the French and Italians over the\r\nAustrians.\r\n\r\n=Soli.= An ancient town of Asia Minor, on the coast of Cilicia. In the\r\nwar between Mithridates and the Romans, Soli was destroyed by Tigranes,\r\nbut subsequently rebuilt by Pompey, who settled there many of the\r\npirates whom he had captured, and called the town after himself,\r\nPompeiapolis.\r\n\r\n=Solicinium.= A town in Roman Germany, on the mountain Pirus, where\r\nValentinian gained a victory over the Alemanni in 369, probably in the\r\nneighborhood of the modern Heidelberg.\r\n\r\n=Solid Shot.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Solid Square.= A square body of troops; a body in which the ranks and\r\nfiles are equal.\r\n\r\n=Sollerets= (_Fr._). Armor for the feet.\r\n\r\n=Somma.= A town of Italy, Lombardy, not far from the Tecino, near the\r\nfoot of Lake Maggiore, 27 miles northwest of Milan. It was near Somma\r\nthat Hannibal gained his first victory on Italian ground, completely\r\ndefeating the Romans under Scipio, 218 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Somnauth=, or =Somnath-Putten=. A town of Guzerat, in Hindostan, is\r\nsituated on the southwest coast of the peninsula of Kattywar. In 1024,\r\nMahmud of Ghizni, the zealous idol-destroyer, appeared before Somnauth,\r\ndrove its defenders to take refuge in the temple, where they defended\r\nthemselves with such valor that Mahmud’s army was forced to retreat; but\r\nthe subsequent rout of two Hindu armies which had advanced to the aid of\r\nthe sacred city so dispirited the defenders, that Somnauth was\r\nimmediately surrendered, the idol destroyed, and the enormous wealth of\r\nthe temple carried off, along with the gates of the temple.\r\n\r\n=Songhay.= A former kingdom of Africa. In 1468-1469 the ruler of Songhay\r\nmarched upon Timbuctoo, and conquered the town and surrounding state.\r\nUnder Háj Mohammed Askia, who came into power at the end of the 15th\r\ncentury, and who was perhaps the greatest sovereign that ever ruled over\r\nNegroland, the Songhay empire extended from Hausa almost to the shores\r\nof the Atlantic, and from lat. 12° N. to the confines of Morocco. After\r\nmany years of revolution and civil war, this great empire became a\r\nprovince of Morocco in 1607.\r\n\r\n=Sonthals.= A tribe of Northern India, brought to Bengal about 1830,\r\nwhere they prospered, till, partly from the instigation of a fanatic,\r\nand partly from the exactions of money-lenders, they broke out into\r\nrebellion in July, 1855, and committed fearful outrages. They were quite\r\nsubdued early in 1856, and many were removed to the newly-conquered\r\nprovince of Pegu.\r\n\r\n=Sooloo=, or =Suluk Islands=. A group of the East Indian Archipelago.\r\nThe sultan of Sooloo and his subordinate chiefs were formerly notorious\r\nfor their piracy, and kept up a large fleet for that purpose; but their\r\npower was entirely broken by the Spaniards in 1851.\r\n\r\n=Sora.= A town of Naples, in the province of Terra di Lavoro, 15 miles\r\neast-northeast from Frosinone. Sora was originally a Volscian city; was\r\nseized by the Romans in 345 B.C., and subsequently made a colony; but in\r\n315 the inhabitants rose against the Romans, and joined their enemies,\r\nthe Samnites. It was not finally secured as a Roman colony till the end\r\nof the second Samnite war in 303.\r\n\r\n=Sorn.= Formerly a servile tenure in Scotland, by which a chieftain\r\nmight, with his followers, live upon his tenants at free quarters.\r\n\r\n=Sorties= (Fr. _sortir_). In a siege, parties who sally out of a town\r\nsecretly to annoy the besiegers, and retard their operations.\r\n\r\n=Sottiates=, or =Sotiates=. A powerful and warlike people in Gallia\r\nAquitanica, on the frontiers of Gallia Narbonensis, were subdued by P.\r\nCrassus, Cæsar’s legate, after a hard-fought battle. The modern _Sos_\r\nprobably represents the ancient town of this people.\r\n\r\n=Sound.= The velocity of sound in the air, at the temperature of 32°\r\nFahr., is about 1090 feet in a second. It is increased or diminished\r\n1.07 feet for each degree of temperature above or below 32°. The\r\ndistance of an object can be ascertained by the report of fire-arms, by\r\nobserving the number of seconds that elapse between the flash and the\r\nreport of a gun, and multiplying the number by the velocity of sound in\r\nair.\r\n\r\n=Sound, To.= To betoken or direct by a sound; as, to sound the retreat;\r\nsound the assembly, etc.\r\n\r\n=Sourabaya=, =Soerabaya=, =Soorabaya=, or =Surabaya=. A large seaport\r\ntown of Java, on the northeast coast. When the French had possession of\r\nJava, the French government resolved to make Sourabaya a port of\r\nconsequence. Gen. Daendels expended large sums in the construction of\r\nworks for the defense of the harbor, and was proceeding in his plans\r\nwhen the island was taken by the British.\r\n\r\n=South Carolina.= An Atlantic State of the American Union, of a\r\ntriangular form, with North Carolina and Georgia on its inland sides. It\r\nis said to have been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1498, or by De\r\nLeon in 1512, and to be permanently settled by the English about 1660.\r\nThe province was divided into North and South in 1729. The Carolinas\r\nwere slave States. Great excitement prevailed in them in November, 1860,\r\non account of Mr. Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency of the\r\nUnited States, he being strongly opposed to slavery. South Carolina\r\nbegan the secession from the United States December 20, 1861. The State\r\nwas restored to the Union in June, 1868. This State took an active part\r\nin the civil war (1861-65), on the Confederate side. See CHARLESTON,\r\nCOLUMBIA, MORRIS ISLAND, MOULTRIE, FORT SUMTER, etc.\r\n\r\n=Southern Confederacy.= See CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n=Sow.= A kind of covered shed, formerly used by besiegers in filling up\r\nand passing the ditch of a besieged place, sapping or mining the wall,\r\nand the like. It had its name from its being used for rooting up the\r\nearth like swine, or because the soldiers therein were like pigs under a\r\nsow.\r\n\r\n=Sowar.= A trooper in an Indian cavalry regiment.\r\n\r\n=Space.= A quantity or portion of extension; the interval between any\r\ntwo or more objects; as, the space between ranks.\r\n\r\n=Spadroon.= A sword much lighter than a broadsword, and made both to cut\r\nand thrust.\r\n\r\n=Spahis.= Were the cavaliers furnished by the holders of military fiefs\r\nto the Turkish army, and formed the _élite_ of its cavalry. The Spahis\r\nalong with the Janissaries owe their organization primarily to Orchan,\r\nthe second of the Ottoman sultans, finally to Sultan Amurath I., and\r\nwhen levied _en masse_ could number 140,000, but such a levy was very\r\nseldom called for. In the field they were divided into two classes,\r\ndistinguished by the color (red and yellow) of their standards. One\r\nclass had pistols and carbines, the other bows and arrows, and both\r\ncarried a sabre, lance, and _jerid_, or javelin. They were excellent\r\nirregular troops; but when European organization was introduced into the\r\nTurkish army, they were replaced (1826) by regular horse. At the present\r\ntime the French have numerous regiments of Spahis, raised from among the\r\nnative tribes of Algeria and from France in about equal proportions; the\r\ndress, especially of the indigenous soldiers, partakes very much of the\r\nArab character. The natives are allowed to rise to any grade below that\r\nof captain; but all the superior officers are of French descent.\r\n\r\n=Spain.= A kingdom of Europe, occupying the larger portion of the great\r\npeninsula which forms the southwestern corner of the European continent,\r\nreaching farther south than any other European country, and farther west\r\nthan any except Portugal. Spain, the _Spania_, _Hispania_, and _Iberia_\r\nof the Greeks, and known to the Romans by the same names, was inhabited\r\nat the period at which it first receives historical mention, by a people\r\nderiving their origin from different races. It is supposed to have been\r\noriginally inhabited by a distinct race called Iberians; upon whom,\r\nhowever, a host of Celts are supposed to have descended from the\r\nPyrenees. In the earliest times of which we have any record, these two\r\nraces had already coalesced and formed the mixed nation of the\r\nCeltiberians. The Phœnicians and Carthaginians successively planted\r\ncolonies on the coasts of Spain about 360 B.C.; and the Romans conquered\r\nthe whole country, 206 B.C., which they erected into a Roman province,\r\nconsisting of two political divisions,--_Hispania Citerior_ (Hither\r\nSpain) and _Hispania Ulterior_ (Farther Spain). From the time of the\r\ncomplete supremacy of the Romans till the death of Constantine, the\r\ncondition of Spain was eminently prosperous. In 409, hordes of\r\nbarbarians, Alans, Vandals, and Suevi, crossed the Pyrenees, and swept\r\nover and desolated the peninsula; about 412, the Visigoths invaded the\r\ncountry, and their king, Athaulf, who acknowledged a nominal dependence\r\non the Roman emperor, established the Gothic monarchy in Catalonia. The\r\nbattle of Xerxes in 711 gave the Moors almost undisputed mastery of\r\nnearly the whole of Spain, as well as of the outlying Gothic province of\r\nSeptimania (Languedoc) in Franco. The Moors held Spain, for the first\r\nfew years of their rule, as a dependency of the province of North\r\nAfrica; but, after the downfall of Muza and his son Abd-el-aziz, who had\r\nbeen the deputy-governor of Spain, the country was governed (1717) by\r\nemirs appointed by the caliph of Damascus. The favorite scheme pursued\r\nby the Spanish emirs was the extension of their conquests into Gaul, to\r\nthe neglect of the rising power of the Goths in Asturias; they also took\r\nthe Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Corsica, and part of Apulia and\r\nCalabria; but their northward progress was signally checked on the plain\r\nof Tours by Charles Martel. Anarchy and bloodshed were prominent\r\nfeatures of the first forty years of Mohammedan rule in Spain. Within\r\nthis period of forty years, no fewer than twenty emirs had been called\r\nto the direction of affairs; but a revolution at Damascus, which\r\nunseated the Ommiades, and placed the Abbasides in possession of the\r\ncaliphate, put an end to this state of misrule in Spain. The Moors at\r\nlength suffered a great defeat at Tarifa, by Alfonso XI. of Castile in\r\n1340, and nearly the whole Christian dominions of Spain were united in\r\none monarchy in 1479; but the power of the Moors was not finally\r\nextirpated until 1492, when Spain was consolidated into one empire from\r\nthe Pyrenees to the Strait of Gibraltar. But the expulsion of the Moors\r\nand Jews was productive of the direst results, and the decline of the\r\nsplendid Spanish empire may be said to have had its origin in the event\r\nwhich raised the country to the height of its magnificence. In the reign\r\nof Charles I., Mexico and Peru were added to the possessions of Spain.\r\nPhilip II., by his enormous war expenditure and maladministration, laid\r\na sure foundation for the decline of the country; and the reigns of\r\nPhilip III. and Philip IV. witnessed a fearful acceleration in the\r\ndecline of Spain by the contests with the Dutch, and with the German\r\nProtestants in the Thirty Years’ War, the intermeddling in the affairs\r\nof Northern Italy, the rebellion of the Catalans, the wars with France,\r\nand the rebellion of Portugal (1640), which had been united to Spain by\r\nPhilip II. That of Charles II. was still more unfortunate, and the death\r\nof the latter was the occasion of the War of the Spanish Succession.\r\n(See SUCCESSION WARS.) During the inglorious reign of Charles IV.\r\n(1788-1808), a war broke out with Britain, which was productive of\r\nnothing but disaster to the Spaniards, and by the pressure of the French\r\nanother arose in 1804, and was attended with similar ill success.\r\nCharles abdicated in favor of his eldest son, the prince of the\r\nAsturias, who ascended the throne as Ferdinand VII. Forced by Napoleon\r\nto resign all claims to the Spanish throne, Ferdinand became a prisoner\r\nof the French in the year of his accession, and in the same year Joseph,\r\nthe brother of the French emperor, was declared king of Spain. But an\r\narmed resistance was organized throughout the whole country, and the\r\nsupreme junta, that of Seville, declared war against Napoleon and France\r\non June 6, 1808. In July, England, on solicitation, made peace with\r\nSpain, recognized Ferdinand VII. as king, and sent an army to aid the\r\nSpanish insurrection. This war lasted until the beginning of 1814, when\r\nthe allied armies of England, Spain, and Portugal were thoroughly\r\nvictorious. For important events which took place during this war, see\r\nappropriate headings in this work. Ferdinand VII. treated the subjects\r\nwho had shown him devoted loyalty with infamous ingratitude, and\r\nsubsequently obtained the aid of France to establish despotism. The\r\nreign of his daughter Isabella II. was disturbed by the Carlist\r\nrebellion in 1834-39, in which the British aided the queen with an army\r\nunder Sir De Lacy Evans. The next events of importance were the contest\r\nbetween Espartero, the regent, and Queen-dowager Christina, for the\r\nsupreme power during the minority of the queen; Espartero’s flight\r\nbefore O’Donnell and Narvaez (1843); his restoration in 1847; banishment\r\nof Queen Christina (1854); formation of the O’Donnell ministry (1858);\r\nwar with Morocco and annexation of St. Domingo (1861); war with Peru and\r\nChili (1864-65), and permanent truce in 1871; Prince Amadeus of Savoy\r\ndeclared king in December, 1870; abdication, February, 1873;\r\ninsurrection of Don Carlos, 1873-76, when Prince Alfonso, son of Queen\r\nIsabella, became king.

It was taken by the Swedes in 1631, and by the\r\nFrench in 1806.\r\n\r\n=Spanish Fury, The.= A name given, in history, to the attack upon\r\nAntwerp by the Spaniards, November 4, 1576, which resulted in the\r\npillage and burning of the place, and a monstrous massacre of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n=Spanish War of Succession.= See SUCCESSION WARS.\r\n\r\n=Spare-pole.= See ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n=Spare-pole Key.= See ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n=Spare-pole Ring.= See ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n=Spare-wheel Axle.= See ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\n=Sparta.= Also called Lacedæmon, the capital of Laconia and the chief\r\ncity of Peloponnesus, was situated on the right bank of the Eurotas (now\r\n_Iri_), about 20 miles from the sea. Sparta was never surrounded by\r\nwalls, since the bravery of its citizens and the difficulty of access to\r\nit were supposed to render such defense needless. In the mythical\r\nperiod, Argos was the chief city in Peloponnesus, and Sparta is\r\nrepresented as subject to it. The Dorian conquest of Peloponnesus,\r\nwhich, according to tradition, took place eighty years after the Trojan\r\nwar, made Sparta the capital of the country. The oldest inhabitants of\r\nthe country maintained themselves at Amyclæ, which was not conquered for\r\na long time. From various causes the Spartans became distracted by\r\nintestine quarrels, till at length Lycurgus gave a new constitution to\r\nthe state. This constitution laid the foundation of Sparta’s greatness.\r\nShe soon became aggressive, and gradually extended her sway over the\r\ngreater part of Peloponnesus. In 743 B.C. the Spartans attacked\r\nMessenia, and after a war of twenty years subdued this country. In 685\r\nthe Messenians again took up arms, but at the end of seventeen years\r\nwere again completely subdued, and their country from this time forward\r\nbecame an integral part of Laconia. After the close of the second\r\nMessenian war, the Spartans continued their conquests in Peloponnesus.\r\nThey defeated the Tegeans, and wrested the district of Thyreæ from the\r\nArgives. At the time of the Persian invasion they were confessedly the\r\nfirst people in Greece; and to them was granted by unanimous consent the\r\nchief command in war. But after the final defeat of the Persians, the\r\nhaughtiness of Pausanias, king of Sparta, disgusted most of the Greek\r\nstates, and led them to transfer the supremacy to Athens (477). From\r\nthis time the power of Athens steadily increased, and Sparta possessed\r\nlittle influence outside of the Peloponnesus. The Spartans made several\r\nattempts to check the rising greatness of Athens, and their jealousy of\r\nthe latter led at length to the Peloponnesian war (431). This war ended\r\nin the overthrow of Athens, and the restoration of the supremacy of\r\nSparta over the rest of Greece (404). But the Spartans did not retain\r\nthis supremacy more than thirty years. Their decisive defeat by the\r\nThebans, under Epaminondas, at the battle of Leuctra (371), gave the\r\nSpartan power a shock from which it never recovered; and the restoration\r\nof the Messenians to their country two years afterward completed the\r\nhumiliation of Sparta. Thrice was the Spartan territory invaded by the\r\nThebans, and the Spartan women saw for the first time the watch-fires of\r\nan enemy’s camp. The Spartans now finally lost their supremacy over\r\nGreece; and about thirty years afterward the greater part of Greece was\r\nobliged to yield to Philip of Macedon. The Spartans, however, kept\r\nhaughtily aloof from the Macedonian conqueror, and refused to take part\r\nin the Asiatic expedition of his son, Alexander the Great. The power of\r\nSparta continued to decline until the beginning of the reign of\r\nCleomenes III. (236), whose reforms for a time infused new blood into\r\nthe state, and for a short time he carried on war with success against\r\nthe Achæans. But Aratus, the general of the Achæans, called in the\r\nassistance of Antigonus Doson, king of Macedonia, who defeated Cleomenes\r\nat the decisive battle of Sellasia (221), and followed up his success by\r\nthe capture of Sparta. Sparta now sank into insignificance, and was\r\nruled by a succession of native tyrants, till at length it was compelled\r\nto abolish its peculiar institutions, and to join the Achæan League.\r\nShortly afterward it fell, with the rest of Greece, under the Roman\r\npower. The Spartans were a race of stern, cruel, resolute, rude, and\r\nnarrow-minded warriors, capable of a momentary self-sacrificing\r\npatriotism, but utterly destitute of the capacity for adopting or\r\nappreciating a permanently noble and wise policy.\r\n\r\n=Spartans.= See SPARTA.\r\n\r\n=Sparthe.= An Anglo-Saxon term for a halbert or battle-axe.\r\n\r\n=Sparum.= A kind of dart, which was used by the ancients in war, and was\r\nshot out of a cross-bow. The wound it occasioned was extremely\r\ndangerous, as its point was triangular. Several of these darts were\r\ndischarged in a volley.\r\n\r\n=Spatterdashes.= Were a kind of covering for the legs of soldiers, made\r\nof cloth, or coarse linen waxed over, and buttoned tight, by which the\r\nwet was kept off.\r\n\r\n=Spatts.= Were a kind of spatterdashes, that reached only a little above\r\nthe ankle.\r\n\r\n=Spayade.= In heraldry, a stag in his third year; a spay.\r\n\r\n=Spear.= A lance or long weapon with a sharp point, formerly used as a\r\nmanual or missile weapon. Pliny ascribes the invention of the spear to\r\nthe Etolians. The spear of the Greeks was generally of ash, with a\r\nleaf-shaped head of metal, and furnished with a pointed ferrule at the\r\nbutt, with which it was stuck in the ground; a method used, according to\r\nHomer, when the troops rested on their arms, or slept upon their\r\nshields. The cross spear-heads of the Britons were all pyramidal,\r\nnarrowing at the base. The heads of the Anglo-Saxon spears were\r\nexceedingly long, and sometimes dreadfully barbed.\r\n\r\n=Spear-hand.= The hand in which a horseman holds a spear; the right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n=Spear-head.= The pointed end of a spear.\r\n\r\n=Spearman.= One who is armed with a spear.\r\n\r\n=Special Duty.= Soldiers may be employed on duties not strictly\r\nmilitary, when the exigencies of the service require it, for the reason\r\nthat they are incident to the operations of an army; as, mechanics,\r\nlaborers, cooks, and attendants in hospitals, clerks, scouts, etc.\r\nSoldiers when detailed on these duties are generally reported on special\r\nor extra duty, but are required to attend the regular inspections and\r\nmusters, and if not proficient in drill, should be required to attend\r\ndrills until they know their duties as soldiers. Officers when placed on\r\nduty which temporarily relieves them from duty with their companies, as\r\nacting commissaries and quartermasters, or on court-martial duty, etc.,\r\nare reported on special duty.\r\n\r\n=Special Orders.= See ORDERS, SPECIAL.\r\n\r\n=Specific Gravity.= See GRAVITY.\r\n\r\n=Specification.= The designation of particulars; particular mention; as,\r\nthe specification of a charge against a military officer. A written\r\nstatement containing a minute description or enumeration of particulars,\r\nas of charges against officers or soldiers.\r\n\r\n=Speen.= A parish of England, in Berkshire, 2 miles from Newbury, in\r\nwhich the second battle of Newbury was fought, October 27, 1646.\r\n\r\n=Spencer Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS, and MAGAZINE GUNS.\r\n\r\n=Spend.= This term is sometimes used in military matters to express the\r\nconsumption of anything; as, to spend all your ammunition.\r\n\r\n=Spent Ball.= A ball shot from a fire-arm, which reaches an object\r\nwithout having sufficient force to penetrate it.\r\n\r\n=Speyer=, also =Speier=. The capital of Rhenish Bavaria (the former\r\nPalatinate), and one of the oldest towns in Germany, stands at the\r\ninflux of the Speyerbach in the Rhine 23 miles north of Carlsruhe.\r\nDuring the Orleans Succession war--well called by the Germans the\r\n_Mordbrenner Krieg_--the whole Palatinate was savagely wasted, Speyer\r\nwas taken by the French, its inhabitants driven out, and the city blown\r\nup with gunpowder and burned to the ground. Only the cathedral resisted\r\nthe barbarous efforts to mine it. In 1794, it was wasted by the French\r\nunder Custine, and has never recovered from these calamities.\r\n\r\n=Spherical Bullets.= See PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n=Spherical Case-Shot.= A spherical case-shot consists of a thin shell of\r\ncast iron, containing a number of musket-balls, and a charge of powder\r\nsufficient to burst it; a fuze is fixed to it as in an ordinary shell,\r\nby which the charge is ignited and the shell burst at any particular\r\ninstant. A spherical case-shot, when loaded ready for use, has about the\r\nsame specific gravity as a solid shot, and therefore, when fixed with\r\nthe service charge of powder, its range, and its velocity at any point\r\nin its range, is about equal to that of a solid shot of the same\r\ncaliber. The spherical case mostly used for field service is the\r\n12-pounder, and contains, when loaded, 90 bullets. Its bursting charge\r\nis 1 ounce of powder, and it weighs 11.75 pounds. Its rupture may be\r\nmade to take place at any point in its flight, and it is therefore\r\nsuperior to grape or canister. The attrition of the balls with which it\r\nis loaded, formerly endangered the firing of the bursting charge. This\r\nis now obviated, in making one mass of the balls, by pouring in melted\r\nsulphur. It is also prevented by Capt. Boxer’s improved spherical\r\ncase-shot, of which there are two forms. In one form the bursting charge\r\nof powder is contained in a cylindrical tin box, attached to a brass\r\nsocket which receives the fuze, and which is screwed into the shell. In\r\nthe other, the part of the shell containing the bursting charge is\r\nseparated from that containing the bullets by a diaphragm of sheet-iron,\r\ncast into the shell (_i.e._, the shell is cast on to the diaphragm which\r\nis inserted into the core). The bullets are introduced into the shell by\r\na second orifice, and are kept in their places by a composition\r\nafterwards poured in. The present 12-pounder spherical case-shot, fixed\r\nwith a charge of 2¹⁄₂ pounds of powder, is effective at 1500 yards. The\r\nproper position of the point of rupture varies from 50 to 130 yards in\r\nfront of, and from 15 to 20 feet above, the object. The mean number of\r\ndestructive pieces from a 12-pounder spherical case-shot, which may\r\nstrike a target 9 feet high and 54 feet long, at a distance of 800\r\nyards, is 30. The spherical case-shot from rifle-cannon is said to be\r\neffective at over 2000 yards. Spherical case should not be used at a\r\nless distance than 500 yards.\r\n\r\n=Spicheren=, or =Speicheren=. See SAARBRUCK.\r\n\r\n=Spike Cannon, To.= Is to drive into the vent a jagged and hardened\r\nsteel spike with a soft point, or a nail without a head; break it off\r\nflush with the outer surface and clinch the point inside by means of a\r\nrammer. A gun may be unspiked if the spike is not screwed in or\r\nclinched, and the bore is not impeded, by putting in a charge of powder\r\none-third of the weight of the shot, and ramming junk-wads over it;\r\nlaying on the bottom of the bore a slip of wood, with a groove on the\r\nunder side containing a strand of quick-match, by which fire is\r\ncommunicated to the charge. In a brass gun, take out some of the metal\r\nat the upper orifice of the vent, and pour sulphuric acid into the\r\ngroove, and let it stand some hours before firing. If this method,\r\nseveral times repeated, is not successful, unscrew the vent-piece if it\r\nbe a brass gun; and if an iron one, drill out the spike, or drill a new\r\nvent.\r\n\r\nArtillery can be rendered unserviceable by other methods besides\r\nspiking, as follows: (1) Wedge a shot in the bottom of the bore by\r\nwrapping it with felt, or by means of iron wedges, using the rammer or a\r\nbar of iron to drive them in. (2) Cause shells to burst in the bore of\r\nbronze guns. (3) Fire broken shot from them with large charges. (4) Fill\r\nthe piece with sand over the charge, to burst it. (5) Fire a piece\r\nagainst another, muzzle to muzzle, or the muzzle of one to the chase of\r\nthe other. (6) Light a fire under the chase of a bronze gun, and strike\r\non it with a sledge, to bend it. (7) Break off the trunnions of iron\r\nguns; or burst them by firing them at a high elevation, with heavy\r\ncharges and full of shot.\r\n\r\nTo drive out a shot wedged in the bore: unscrew the vent-piece if there\r\nbe one, and drive in wedges so as to start the shot forward; then ram it\r\nback again in order to seize the wedge with a hook; or pour in powder,\r\nand fire it after replacing the vent-piece. In the last resort, bore a\r\nhole in the bottom of the breech, drive out the shot, and stop the hole\r\nwith a screw. When a shot is jammed in a gun and cannot be rammed home\r\nto the cartridge, destroy the charge by pouring water down the vent and\r\nmuzzle until the ingredients are dissolved, and cleared out of the bore;\r\nthen introduce a small quantity of powder through the vent and blow out\r\nthe shot.\r\n\r\n=Spin Hay, To.= Is to twist it up in ropes, very hard, for an\r\nexpedition; by which means it is less bulky, and less troublesome for\r\nthe cavalry to carry behind them. An expert horseman can spin five days’\r\nforage into a very narrow compass.\r\n\r\n=Spingard.= A kind of small cannon.\r\n\r\n=Splay.= The divergence outwards from the line of fire of the lines\r\nwhich mark the bottom of the sides of an embrasure.\r\n\r\n=Splinter-bar.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Splinter-proof.= Strong enough to resist the splinters of bursting\r\nshells.\r\n\r\n=Spoils.= Whatever is taken from the enemy in time of war. Among the\r\nancient Greeks, the spoils were divided among the whole army, only the\r\nshare given to the general was the largest; but among the Romans the\r\nspoils belonged to the republic.\r\n\r\n=Spoleto= (anc. _Spoletium_). A city of Central Italy, province of\r\nUmbria, is situated on a rocky hill, 61 miles north-northwest of Rome.\r\nDuring the second Punic war, Hannibal is said to have been repulsed by\r\nthe colonists in an assault which he made on the town (217 B.C.), after\r\nthe battle of Thrasymene. In 1860 it was taken by the Italians from a\r\nbody of Irish mercenaries in the service of the pope, and now forms part\r\nof the kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Sponge.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Sponge and Rammer-stop.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Sponge-bucket.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Sponge-chain.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Sponge-hook.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Spontoon.= A weapon bearing resemblance to a halberd, which, prior to\r\n1787, was borne instead of a half-pike by officers of British infantry.\r\nIt was a medium for signaling orders to the regiment. The spontoon\r\nplanted in the ground commanded a halt; pointed backwards or forwards,\r\nadvance or retreat; and so on.\r\n\r\n=Sporting Powder.= Gunpowder used in sporting arms,--usually finer\r\ngrained than that for military arms.\r\n\r\n=Sporting Rifle.= A rifle made especially for hunting. There is no\r\ninvariable feature distinguishing it from other rifles. Ordinarily the\r\nrear sight is not elevating.\r\n\r\n=Spottsylvania Court-house.= A village in Spottsylvania Co., Va.,\r\nsituated on the river Po, 65 miles north from Richmond. A series of\r\ndesperate battles took place in the neighborhood of this village between\r\nthe Federals and Confederates, from May 8 to 21, 1864, in which the\r\nformer compelled the latter, after much carnage, to retreat to the North\r\nAnna River, which ultimately resulted in the battle of Cold Harbor\r\n(which see).\r\n\r\n=Spread-eagle.= In heraldry, an eagle, or the figure of an eagle, with\r\nits wings elevated and its legs extended;--often met as a device in\r\nheraldry, upon military ornaments, and the like.\r\n\r\n=Springfield.= A post-town, capital of Greene Co., Mo., 130 miles\r\nsouthwest of Jefferson City. Near here was fought the desperate battle\r\nof Wilson’s Creek, in which the Federals had the advantage over the\r\nConfederates, but lost their brave general, Nathaniel Lyon, August 10,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n=Springfield.= A city of Massachusetts, on the east bank of the\r\nConnecticut River, 98 miles west by south of Boston. The national armory\r\nis located here, which repaired and altered in 1869 upwards of 25,000\r\nrifles and muskets. The present U. S. breech-loader, model of 1873, is\r\nmade here.\r\n\r\n=Springfield Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Sprue.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF, MOLDING.\r\n\r\n=Spur.= An apparatus fastened to the heel of a horseman, for goading the\r\nhorse. It is much less used than formerly. All cavalry soldiers wear\r\nspurs; but their use, except in the heat of an actual charge, is\r\ndiscouraged as much as possible. In the days of chivalry, the use of the\r\nspur was limited to knights, and it was among the emblems of knighthood.\r\nTo win his spurs, was for a young man to earn knighthood by gallant\r\nconduct. The degradation of a knight involved the hacking off of his\r\nspurs; and the serving before a knight of a pair of spurs on a dish, was\r\na strong hint by his host that he had outstayed his welcome.\r\n\r\n=Spurs, Battle of the.= See COURTRAI.\r\n\r\n=Spy.= In war, is a useful but not highly honored auxiliary, employed to\r\nascertain the state of an enemy’s affairs, and of his intended\r\noperations. Spies have been used in all wars from the time when Moses\r\nsent Joshua on such a purpose to the present time. Their employment is\r\nquite recognized by the law of nations as interpreted by Grotius,\r\nVattel, and Martens; nor is it held to be any dishonor to a general to\r\navail himself of their services. On the other hand, the spy himself is\r\nlooked upon as an outlaw, and one devoid of honor. If taken by the\r\nenemy, he is put to death ignominiously and without mercy. As, however,\r\nthe calling is so dangerous, and so little redounds to honor, it is\r\nnever permissible for a general to compel by threats any person, whether\r\nof his own or the hostile party, to act as a spy; but he is at liberty\r\nto accept all such services when proffered. A spy is well paid, lest he\r\nbetray his employer. In the British army, spies are usually controlled\r\nby the quartermaster-general. Martial law, though distinct enough in\r\nordering the death of a spy, is not clear in defining what constitutes a\r\nspy. A man--not of the enemy--within the enemy’s lines, and in the\r\nenemy’s uniform, would presumably be a spy. If in civil dress, and\r\nunable to give a good account of himself, his chance of hanging would be\r\nconsiderable; but if found in one camp in the uniform of the opposite\r\nside, he may not be treated otherwise than as a prisoner of war, or at\r\nleast as a deserter from the enemy. Both as regards honor and penalties,\r\nit would seem that spies ought in fairness to be divided into two\r\nclasses,--first, those who betray their own country to an enemy;\r\nsecondly, those who, being enemies, contrive surreptitiously to obtain\r\ninformation by penetrating into the opposing army. The first class are\r\ntraitors of a deep dye, for whom no ignominious death is too bad; but\r\nthe second class are often brave men, who dare much in the service of\r\ntheir country. It is unfair to accord them the same treatment as the\r\ntraitors.\r\n\r\n=Squad.= A small portion of a company, troop, or battery, placed in the\r\nespecial charge of an officer or non-commissioned officer for purposes\r\nof inspection and supervision. In the infantry it corresponds with a\r\nsection. It also signifies a small number of men drilled together. The\r\nterm _awkward squad_ is applied to those soldiers who, on account of\r\nclumsiness or want of attention, are sent back to the lowest squad to be\r\nre-drilled.\r\n\r\n=Squad Book.= In the British service, is the roll of a squad,\r\ncontaining, besides the names, the trades and other particulars of the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n=Squad-bags.= In the British service, are black canvas bags, which are\r\nissued at the rate of one to every 25 men, and are intended to contain\r\nthose articles of a man’s kit which are not comprised in the “service\r\nkit.” They are only used when a regiment is in the field or on the line\r\nof march. In India, where knapsacks are never carried, a small squad-bag\r\nis issued to each soldier.\r\n\r\n=Squadron.= In military language, denotes two troops of cavalry. It is\r\nthe unit by which the force of cavalry with an army is always computed.\r\nThree or four squadrons constitute a regiment. The actual strength of a\r\nsquadron ranges from 120 to 200 sabres.\r\n\r\n=Squall.= A sudden and violent gust of wind, often attended with rain or\r\nsnow. _Black squall_, a squall attended with dark, heavy clouds. _Thick\r\nsquall_, a black squall accompanied by rain, hail, sleet, etc. _White\r\nsquall_, a squall which comes unexpectedly, without being marked in its\r\napproach by the clouds.\r\n\r\n=Square.= In military evolutions, is the forming of a body of men into a\r\nrectangular figure, with several ranks or rows of men facing on each\r\nside. With men of ordinary firmness, a square should resist the charges\r\nof the heaviest horse. The formation is not new, for a Grecian\r\n_Syntagma_ was a solid square of 16 men in every direction; but in\r\nmodern warfare, the solid square having been found cumbrous, has been\r\nabandoned for the hollow square, with officers, horses, colors, etc., in\r\nthe centre. The front rank kneels, and the two next stoop, which enables\r\nfive ranks of men to maintain a rolling fire upon an advancing enemy, or\r\nto pour in a murderous volley at close quarters.\r\n\r\n=Square-pierced.= In heraldry, a term used to designate a charge\r\nperforated with a square opening, so as to show the field. A cross\r\nsquare-pierced is often improperly confounded with a cross\r\nquarter-pierced, where the intersecting part of the cross is not merely\r\nperforated, but entirely removed.\r\n\r\n=Squire.= An attendant on a warrior was formerly so called.\r\n\r\n=Stab.= To pierce with a pointed weapon; as, to be stabbed by a bayonet,\r\ndagger, etc.\r\n\r\n=Stabiæ= (now _Castella Mare di Stabia_). An ancient town in Campania,\r\nbetween Pompeii and Surrentum; was destroyed by Sulla in the Social war.\r\n\r\n=Stable Guard.= In each squadron, the stable guard generally consists of\r\na corporal and one man for every 20 horses. It is their duty to feed the\r\nhorses, watch over their safety during the night, and attend to the\r\ngeneral police of the stables, being assisted by an additional detail at\r\nthe hours of stable call.\r\n\r\n=Stable Horse.= A name formerly applied to that part of the Tippoo\r\nSahib’s cavalry which was best armed, accoutred, and most regularly\r\ndisciplined.\r\n\r\n=Stack Arms.= To set up muskets or rifles together, with the bayonets\r\ncrossing one another, and forming a sort of conical pile.\r\n\r\n=Stack of Arms.= A number of muskets or rifles set up together, with the\r\nbayonets crossing one another, forming a sort of conical pile.\r\n\r\n=Stacket.= A stockade.\r\n\r\n=Stadia.= A very simple aid in estimating distances, consists of a small\r\nstick, held vertically in the hand at arm’s length, and bringing the top\r\nof a man’s head in line with the top of the stick, noting where a line\r\nin the eye of the observer to the feet of the man cuts the stick or\r\n_stadia_, as it is called. To graduate the stadia, a man of the ordinary\r\nheight of a foot-soldier, say 5 feet 8 inches, is placed at a known\r\ndistance, say 50 yards, and the distance on the stick covered by him\r\nwhen it is held at arm’s length is marked and divided into eight equal\r\nparts. If the distance is now increased until the man covers only one of\r\nthese divisions, we know he is at a distance equal to 50 × 8 = 400\r\nyards. This instrument is not very accurate, except for short distances.\r\nA much more accurate stadia is constructed by making use of a metal\r\nplate having a slit in it in the form of an isosceles triangle, the base\r\nof which, held at a certain distance from the edge, subtends a man (5\r\nfeet 8 inches), say at the distance of 100 yards. A slider moves along\r\nthe triangle, being always parallel to the base, and the length of it\r\ncomprised between the two sides of the triangle represents the height of\r\nmen at different distances, which are marked in yards on the side of the\r\ntriangle, above or below, according as the object looked at is a\r\nfoot-soldier or horseman. In order to keep the stadia always at the same\r\ndistance from the eye, a string is attached to the slider, the opposite\r\nend having a knot tied in it, which is held between the teeth while\r\nusing the instrument, which is held in the right hand, the slider being\r\nmoved with the left-hand finger. The string should always be kept\r\nstretched when the instrument is used, and the line in a vertical\r\nposition. It must be graduated experimentally by noting the positions in\r\nwhich the slider represents the height of the object. The instrument\r\nused is not, however, reliable. Its uncertainty increases in an equal\r\nratio with the distance of the object observed. At the extreme ranges it\r\nis quite useless. At the school for firing, at Vincennes, therefore,\r\nthey rely entirely on the eye alone for the judgment of distances, and\r\ngreat pains by careful practice and instruction is taken to perfect that\r\njudgment. A simple instrument by which distances can be determined is,\r\ntherefore, still a great desideratum.\r\n\r\n=Staff.= The staff of an army consists of a body of skilled officers\r\nwhose duty it is to combine and give vitality to the movements and\r\nmechanical action of the several regiments and drilled bodies composing\r\nthe force. The distinction between an officer on the staff of an army\r\nand a regimental officer is that the latter is concerned with his own\r\nregiment alone, while the former deals with his army (of course under\r\nthe orders of his commanding officer), or section of an army, and\r\nregulates the combined action of the several arms and bodies of men. A\r\ngood staff is all-important to the success of a military enterprise. In\r\nthe British service the _general staff_ of an army comprises the general\r\nin actual command, with the subordinate generals commanding the several\r\ndivisions and brigades; as assistants to these the officers of the\r\nadjutant-general’s department,--_i.e._, the adjutant-general,\r\nhis deputy, assistants, and deputy-assistants, if the army be\r\nlarge enough to require them all. Similarly, the officers of the\r\nquartermaster-general’s department; the brigade-major; the\r\nprovost-marshal, and the judge-advocate.\r\n\r\nIn the U. S. service the general staff consists of the officers of the\r\nseveral military bureaux, such as of the adjutant-general’s department,\r\nthe quartermaster’s department, etc. For the officers comprising these\r\ncorps, see appropriate headings throughout this work.\r\n\r\nThe _general staff_ of the British army consists at present of a\r\nfield-marshal commanding-in-chief, whose headquarters are at London;\r\nunder him, of a lieutenant-general commanding-in-chief in Ireland. This\r\ncommand includes, of course, the general officer commanding in each\r\nmilitary district of the United Kingdom and in each colony; each of\r\nthese generals having the usual subordinate staff subject to his orders.\r\nIndia forms a nearly independent command, under a commander-in-chief,\r\nwhose headquarters are at Bengal. There are subordinate\r\ncommanders-in-chief in Bombay and Madras; and in each presidency there\r\nare several military divisions.\r\n\r\nThe _personal staff_ consists of the aides-de-camp and military\r\nsecretaries to the respective general officers. These officers, who are\r\ntreated of separately in this work, are appointed within certain limits\r\nby the generals whom they serve, and their appointments expire on those\r\ngenerals ceasing to command.\r\n\r\nThe _garrison staff_ consists of the officers governing in fortresses\r\nand garrisons; as commandants, fort-majors, town-majors, fort-adjutants,\r\nand garrison-adjutants.\r\n\r\nThe _civil_ or _department staff_ includes those non-combatant officers\r\nwho have to provide for the daily requirements of the troops. These are\r\nthe commissaries, barracks, medical, chaplains, purveyors, store, and\r\nveterinary departments.\r\n\r\nThe _recruiting staff_ consists of inspecting field-officers, district\r\npaymasters, district adjutants, and superintending officers.\r\n\r\nThe _pensioner staff_ includes only the staff-officers of the enrolled\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n_Regimental Staff._--(See OFFICERS, STAFF-.) Staff-officers should carry\r\nin their heads all general information regarding the army with which\r\nthey are serving; the composition and distribution of corps, divisions,\r\nbrigades, etc.; they should remember as accurately as possible the\r\nstrength of each battalion in their immediate division, and the names of\r\nthe respective commanding officers. Officers of the headquarters staff\r\nshould know the position of every division or detachment each night;\r\ntheir composition and strength, and the names of their commanders, etc.\r\n\r\nIn communicating orders to others, staff-officers must speak and write\r\nin the name of their generals. They must remember that they have no\r\npower of themselves to confer favors, and that all patronage rests with\r\nthe general. In theory they are merely his agents, and, although, in\r\npractice, officers of importance have much in their power, they should\r\nbe careful to prevent its being generally known. Their commander must\r\nnever be ignored, even when they know him to be a fool. It is not that\r\nyou injure an individual by slighting him, but that by doing so you\r\ndeprive of that general confidence which for the public good it is\r\nessential he should possess.\r\n\r\nIn delivering verbal orders, and in their dealings with superior\r\nofficers, the staff should be most respectful. A staff-officer should\r\nfeel bound by his position, if not by his breeding, to treat every one\r\nwith the courtesy due from one gentleman to another. The motto for the\r\nstaff should be “affability and reticence.”\r\n\r\n=Staff, Cylinder.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Stafford.= A town of England, in Staffordshire, 123 miles northwest by\r\nwest from London. In the civil war of the 17th century, it was occupied\r\nby the king’s forces, after the capture of Lichfield by their\r\nadversaries. An indecisive battle was fought at Hopton Heath, in the\r\nvicinity, in 1643, and at a later period the town was taken by the\r\nRoundheads, under Sir William Brereton. The castle was also taken\r\nshortly after, and at the close of the war was entirely demolished.\r\n\r\n=Stakes, Pointing-.= See POINTING-STAKES.\r\n\r\n=Stalwart.= Brave; bold; strong; redoubted; daring.\r\n\r\n=Stamford.= An ancient town of England, in Lincolnshire, 12 miles\r\nnorthwest from Peterborough. The Britons and Saxons here defeated the\r\nPicts and Scots in 449. Many of the Jews of Stamford were slain, and the\r\nwhole community plundered in 1190 by those who had enlisted for the\r\nCrusade.\r\n\r\n=Stand.= The act of opposing. Thus, troops that do not yield or give\r\nway, are said to make a stand.\r\n\r\n=Stand, To.= To _stand one’s ground_, to keep the ground or station one\r\nhas taken; to maintain one’s position; as, raw troops are not able to\r\nstand their ground against veteran soldiers. _To stand fire_, to receive\r\nthe fire of arms from an enemy without giving way. _To make a stand_, to\r\nhalt for the purpose of offering resistance to a pursuing enemy.\r\n\r\n=Stand at Ease.= In the British service, is to be allowed, when in the\r\nranks, a certain indulgence with regard to bodily position, with or\r\nwithout arms.\r\n\r\n=Stand Fast.= Is the term used as a caution to some particular part of a\r\nline or column, to remain quiescent while the rest are moving.\r\n\r\n=Stand of Arms.= See ARMS, STAND OF.\r\n\r\n=Stand of Ammunition.= See AMMUNITION, STAND OF.\r\n\r\n=Stand of Colors.= A single color, or flag.\r\n\r\n=Stand to the Guns.= Is to prepare for action, by taking one’s station\r\nat the guns.\r\n\r\n=Stand to your Arms.= Is a cautionary command, when soldiers are put\r\nupon the alert.\r\n\r\n=Standard.= A measure by which men enlisted into the army have the\r\nregulated height ascertained.\r\n\r\n=Standard.= In its widest sense, a standard is a flag or ensign under\r\nwhich men are united together for some common purpose. The use of the\r\nstandard as a rallying-point in battle takes us back to remote ages. The\r\nJewish army was marshaled with the aid of standards belonging to the\r\nfour tribes of Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan; and the Egyptians had\r\nensigns with representations of their favorite animals. The flag of\r\nPersia was white, and, according to Xenophon, bore in his time a golden\r\neagle with expanded wings; it was fixed on a chariot, and thus conveyed\r\nto the field of battle. Æschylus, in enumerating the six chiefs who,\r\nheaded by Polynices, set themselves in battle array against Thebes,\r\ndescribes the device on the standard of each. In the earliest era of\r\nRoman history, a bundle of hay or fern is said to have been used as a\r\nmilitary standard, which was succeeded by bronze or silver figures of\r\nanimals attached to a staff, of which Pliny enumerates five,--the eagle,\r\nthe wolf, the minotaur, the horse, and the boar. In the second\r\nconsulship of Marius, 104 B.C., the other animals were laid aside, and\r\nonly the eagle retained, and down to the time of the later emperors, the\r\neagle, often with a representation of the emperor’s head beneath it,\r\ncontinued to be carried with the legion. On the top of the staff was\r\noften a figure of Victory or Mars. Each cohort had also an ensign of its\r\nown, consisting of a serpent or dragon woven on a square piece of cloth,\r\nand elevated on a gilt staff with a cross-bar. Under the Christian\r\nemperors, the _Labarum_ was substituted for the imperial standard.\r\nStandards or ensigns among the Greeks were of different kinds; some had\r\nthe representations of different animals, bearing some relation to the\r\ncities they belonged to. Among the earlier Greeks the standard was a\r\npiece of armor at the end of a spear; though Agamemnon, in Homer, uses a\r\npurple vail to rally his men, etc. Afterwards the Athenians bore the\r\nolive and owl; the Thebans, a sphinx; the other nations, the effigies of\r\ntheir tutelary gods, or their particular symbols, at the end of a spear.\r\nThe Corinthians carried a pegasus, the Messenians their initial Μ, and\r\nthe Lacedæmonians Λ. But the most frequent ensign among the Greeks was a\r\npurple coat upon the top of a spear. The flag or standard elevated was a\r\nsignal to begin the battle, and the standard depressed was a signal to\r\ndesist. The Anglo-Saxon ensign was splendid. It had on it the white\r\nhorse, the Danish being distinguished by the raven. Various standards of\r\ngreat celebrity occur in mediæval history, among which may be enumerated\r\nthe Flag of the Prophet (which see); the standard taken from the Danes\r\nby Alfred of England; and the Oriflamme, originally belonging to the\r\nAbbey of St. Denis, and borne by the counts of Vexin, which eventually\r\nbecame the standard of the French kingdom. In the Middle Ages the\r\nensigns of the army were the banderols, banners, guidons, pencels, and\r\npennons, for which see appropriate headings. In strict language, the\r\nterm standard is applied exclusively to a particular kind of flag, long\r\nin proportion to its depth, tapering towards the fly, and, except when\r\nbelonging to princes of the blood royal, slit at the end. Each baron,\r\nknight, or other commander in feudal times, had a recognized standard,\r\nwhich was distributed among his followers. The length of the standard\r\nvaried according to the rank of the bearer. A king’s standard was from 8\r\nto 9 yards in length; a duke’s, 7 yards; a marquis’s, 6¹⁄₂ yards; an\r\nearl’s, 6 yards; a viscount’s, 5¹⁄₂ yards; a baron’s, 5 yards; a\r\nbanneret’s, 4¹⁄₂ yards; and a knight’s, 4 yards. There was never a\r\ncomplete coat of arms on the standard; it generally exhibited the crest\r\nor supporter with a device or badge of the owner, and every English\r\nstandard of the Tudor era had the cross of St. George at the head.\r\nStandards were registered by the heralds, and the charges on them\r\nselected and authorized by an officer-of-arms.\r\n\r\n=Standard, Battle of the.= See NORTHALLERTON.\r\n\r\n=Standard Hill.= A hill in England, so called because William the\r\nConqueror upon it set his standard, before he gave battle to Harold.\r\n\r\n=Standard-bearer.= An officer of an army, company, or troop, who bears a\r\nstandard; an ensign of infantry or a cornet of horse.\r\n\r\n=Standard-rule.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Standing.= Settled, established, not temporary. _Standing army_, is an\r\narmy which is kept up by a country, and is liable to every species of\r\nduty, without any limitations being fixed to its service.\r\n\r\n=Standing.= Rank; condition. It likewise signifies length of time; as,\r\nsuch an officer is of very old standing in the army.\r\n\r\n=Stanford Bridge.= In Yorkshire, England. In 1066, Tostig, brother of\r\nHarold II., rebelled against his brother, and joined the invading army\r\nof Harold Hardrada, king of Norway. They defeated the northern earls and\r\ntook York, but were defeated at Stanford Bridge by Harold, September 25,\r\nand both were slain.\r\n\r\n=Stang-ball.= A projectile consisting of two half-balls united by a bar;\r\na bar-shot.\r\n\r\n=Stanislaus, Saint.= A Polish order of knighthood, founded by\r\nStanislaus, king of Poland, in 1765; renewed by the emperor Alexander in\r\n1815.\r\n\r\n=Star.= In heraldry, the star is of frequent occurrence; it sometimes\r\nrepresents the heavenly body so called, and sometimes the rowel of a\r\nspur. In the latter case it is blazoned a _Mullet_. Stars of more than\r\nfive points should have the number of points designated, and the points\r\nmay be wavy. The star, or _estoile_, with wavy points, is often\r\ndesignated a blazing star; and when the points are more than six in\r\nnumber, it is usual to represent only every second point as waved. The\r\nstar is a well-known ensign of knightly rank. A star of some specified\r\nform constitutes part of the insignia of every order of knighthood.\r\n\r\n=Star Fort.= An inclosed field-work, in shape like the heraldic\r\nrepresentation of a star.\r\n\r\n=Star, Order of the.= An order of knighthood formerly existing in\r\nFrance, founded by John II in 1350, in imitation of the then recently\r\ninstituted order of the Garter in England. The ceremony of installation\r\nwas originally performed on the festival of the Epiphany, and the name\r\nof the order is supposed to have been allusive to the Star of the Magi.\r\n\r\n=Star of India, The Order of the.= An order of knighthood instituted by\r\nQueen Victoria in June, 1861, with the view of affording the princes,\r\nchiefs, and people of the Indian empire a testimony of her majesty’s\r\nregard, commemorating her majesty’s resolution to take on herself the\r\ngovernment of India and rendering honor to merit and loyalty. The order\r\nconsists of the sovereign, a grand master, who is to be the\r\ngovernor-general of India for the time being, and 25 knights, together\r\nwith such extra and honorary knights as the crown may appoint. The\r\nmembers of the order are to be military, naval, and civil officers who\r\nhave rendered important service to the Indian empire, and such native\r\nprinces and chiefs of India as have entitled themselves to her majesty’s\r\nfavor. The insignia consists of a collar, badge, and star. The collar of\r\nthe order is composed of the heraldic rose of England, two palm branches\r\nin saltire tied with a ribbon, and a lotus-flower alternating with each\r\nother, all of gold enameled, and connected by a double golden chain.\r\nFrom an imperial crown, intervening between two lotus-leaves, depends\r\nthe _badge_, consisting of a brilliant star of five points, and hanging\r\nfrom it an oval medallion, with an onyx cameo profile bust of Queen\r\nVictoria, encircled by the motto, “Heaven’s light our Guide,” in gold\r\nletters, on an enriched border of light-blue enamel. The _investment\r\nbadge_ is similar to the collar-badge, but with the star, the setting of\r\nthe cameo, and the motto all of diamonds; it is worn pendent from a\r\nribbon of pale blue with white borders. The _star_ of the order is a\r\nfive-pointed star or mullet of diamonds on an irradiated field of gold.\r\nAround it, on an azure fillet bordered with gold, is the same motto in\r\ndiamonds, the whole encircled by wavy rays of gold.\r\n\r\n=Star-gauge.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Statant.= In heraldry, a term applied to an animal standing still, with\r\nall the feet touching the ground. If the face be turned to the spectator\r\nit is said to be _statant gardant_, or in the case of a stag, at gaze.\r\n\r\n=State.= In the British service, is a statement of the number of\r\nofficers and men of any body of troops, distinguishing those present,\r\nthose employed, absent, or sick, and the different ranks under separate\r\nheadings.\r\n\r\n=States of the Church.= See PAPAL STATES.\r\n\r\n=Station.= To place; to set; or to appoint to the occupation of a post,\r\nplace, or office; as, to station troops on the right or left of an army;\r\nto station a sentinel on a rampart.\r\n\r\n=Station, Military.= A place calculated for the rendezvous of troops, or\r\nfor the distribution of them; also, a spot well calculated for offensive\r\nor defensive measures. The name of _stationes_, or stations, was given\r\nby the Romans to the guard which was kept in the daytime at the gates of\r\nthe camp, and at the intrenchments. The _statio agraria_ was an advanced\r\npost to prevent surprise, insure the safety of prisoners, etc. The chief\r\nuse was to keep the military sway secure from hostile incursions, whence\r\nwe find them at the concurrence of roads. The word is also extensively\r\napplied to the old military stations of the Romans, when encampments of\r\ntowns existed. The _statira castra_ were encampments for a short time;\r\nthe _æstiva castra_ were the same, but might be occupied only for one\r\nnight. The _hyberna castra_, or winter camps, were elaborately\r\nfortified, even with stone walls, houses within, etc., so that many\r\ntowns grew out of them.\r\n\r\n=Status in Quo=, or =Status Quo= (_Lat._). A treaty between\r\nbelligerents, which leaves each party _in statu quo ante bellum_,--that\r\nis, in the state in which it was before the war.\r\n\r\n=Stays.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Steam-gun.= A machine or contrivance by which balls or other\r\nprojectiles may be driven by the force of steam.\r\n\r\n=Steed.= A horse either for state or war.\r\n\r\n=Steel.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR.\r\n\r\n=Steel Punches.= See INSPECTION OF PROJECTILES.\r\n\r\n=Steenkerke=, or =Steenkerque=.

The allies, commanded by\r\nWilliam III. of England, were here defeated by the French, July 24,\r\n1692.\r\n\r\n=Step.= Progression by one removal of the foot. It likewise signifies\r\npace. _To step_, to move forward or backward by a single change of the\r\nplace of the foot. _To step out_, is to lengthen the step, without\r\naltering the cadence. _To step short_, is to diminish or slacken the\r\npace, according to the tactics. These phrases are frequently used in\r\nmilitary movements when it is found necessary to gain ground in front,\r\nor to give the rear of a column, etc., time to acquire its proper\r\ndistance. _To step off_, is to take a prescribed step from a halted\r\nposition, in common or quick time, in conformity to some given word of\r\ncommand or signal. _Balance-step_, is so called from the body being\r\nbalanced upon one leg, in order to render it firm and steady in military\r\nmovements, etc. Step is likewise figuratively used to signify promotion;\r\nas, the next step from a lieutenancy is a captaincy, from a captaincy a\r\nmajority, etc.\r\n\r\n=Stettin.= A fortified town of Prussia, capital of the province of\r\nPomerania, on the left bank of the Oder, 78 miles northeast from Berlin.\r\nIn 1121, Boleslas, duke of Poland, gained possession of it. The peace of\r\nWestphalia gave it to the Swedes. From them it passed to the Prussians,\r\nwith whom, though not without some interruptions, it has since remained.\r\nIn 1171 it was besieged by the Danes; in 1677 by the elector of\r\nBrandenburg; in 1713 by the Prussians; and from 1806 to 1813 it was\r\noccupied by the French.\r\n\r\n=Steward, Hospital.= See HOSPITAL STEWARD.\r\n\r\n=Stick, Gold.= See GOLD STICK.\r\n\r\n=Stick, Silver.= See SILVER STICK.\r\n\r\n=Stickler.= A sidesman to fencers, or second to a duelist.\r\n\r\n=Sticklestadt= (Norway).

The township includes the incorporated village of\r\nMechanicsville and the post-village of Bemis’s Heights, notable for the\r\ntwo battles of September 19 and October 7, 1777 (sometimes called the\r\nbattles of Stillwater), which led to the surrender of Burgoyne.\r\n\r\n=Stink-pot.= Is a shell, often of earthenware, charged with\r\ncombustibles, which, on bursting, emit a foul smell and a suffocating\r\nsmoke. It is useful in sieges for driving the garrison from their\r\ndefenses; also in boarding a ship, for effecting a diversion while the\r\nassailants gain the deck. The stink-pot is a favorite weapon of the\r\nChinese. Under the more elegant title of _asphyxiated shell_, the French\r\nand other modern nations have experimented considerably on this mode of\r\nharassing an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Stipendium.= The amount of pay for soldiers, a term in general use\r\namong the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Stirling.= An ancient town of Scotland, the chief town of\r\nStirlingshire, 31 miles northwest from Edinburgh. During the Danish\r\ninvasion in 1009, it was the headquarters of the Scottish army. In the\r\nvicinity was fought the battle of Stirling in 1297. The town was taken\r\nby Edward I., after a siege of three months, in 1304. It was held by the\r\nEnglish for ten years, until it was retaken by Robert Bruce after the\r\nbattle of Bannockburn. In 1651, after the battle of Dunbar, the castle\r\nwas taken by Gen. Monk; and it withstood a siege by the Highlanders in\r\n1745.\r\n\r\n=Stirrup.= A kind of ring, or bent piece of metal, leather, etc.,\r\nhorizontal in one part for receiving the foot of the rider, and attached\r\nto a strap which is fastened to the saddle,--used to assist persons in\r\nmounting a horse, and to enable them to sit steadily in riding, as well\r\nas to relieve them by supporting a part of the weight of the body.\r\n\r\n=Stirrup-cover= (Sp. _tapadéra_).

The stockades or picket-works\r\nusually employed against Indians are composed of rough trunks of young\r\ntrees cut into lengths of 12 or 14 feet, and averaging 10 or 12 inches\r\nin diameter. They should be firmly planted close together. A banquette\r\nor step will generally be required, and the loop-holes so arranged that\r\nthey cannot be used from the outside. If necessary, such a work can be\r\nstrengthened by ditch and abatis, and flanked by block-houses.\r\n\r\n=Stockholm.= The capital of Sweden, situated at the junction of the Lake\r\nMalar with an inlet of the Baltic, 320 miles northeast from Copenhagen.\r\nStockholm sustained several sieges. One of the most memorable of these\r\ntook place in 1501 and 1502, when it was held for nearly six months by\r\nQueen Christina of Denmark against the Swedish insurgents, but was at\r\nlast surrendered after the garrison had been reduced from about 1000 to\r\n80 in number. A still more noble defense of the city was made in 1520,\r\nby Christina Gyllenstierna against Christian II. of Denmark. It was\r\nsurrendered after a siege of four months; but the terms of the surrender\r\nwere violated soon after by the conqueror ordering the execution of all\r\nthe most distinguished Swedes in the town. This and similar acts of\r\ntreachery and cruelty led to the final expulsion of the Danes by\r\nGustavus Vasa. A peace was concluded here, between the king of Great\r\nBritain and the queen of Sweden, by which the former acquired the\r\nduchies of Bremen and Verden as elector of Brunswick, November 20, 1719.\r\nA treaty took place here, between Sweden and Russia, in favor of the\r\nDuke of Holstein-Gottorp, March 24, 1724; another between England and\r\nSweden on March 3, 1813; and between England, France, and Sweden,\r\nNovember 21, 1855.\r\n\r\n=Stockport.= A town of England, in Cheshire, on the borders of\r\nLancashire, at the confluence of the Mersey and the Tame, 5 miles\r\nsoutheast of Manchester. The castle, which has now entirely disappeared,\r\nwas held in 1173, by Geoffrey de Constantin against Henry II. During the\r\ncivil war of the 17th century, Stockport was the scene of some fighting;\r\nit was taken from the Parliamentarians by Rupert in 1644, but retaken by\r\nLesley in the following year. In 1745, the town was occupied by Prince\r\nCharles Edward. At this place the Manchester Blanketeers (which see)\r\nwere dispersed, March 11, 1817.\r\n\r\n=Stock-purse.= In the British service, is a certain saving which is made\r\nin a corps for regimental purposes.\r\n\r\n=Stockton-on-Tees.= A town of England, in Durham, on the left bank of\r\nthe Tees, 11 miles east-northeast of Darlington.

Marcius\r\nRex, 118 B.C., before he founded the colony of Narbo Martius.\r\n\r\n=Stoke, East.= A parish of England, county of Notts, 4 miles southwest\r\nof Newark. Near here, on June 16, 1487, the adherents of Lambert Simnel,\r\nwho personated Edward, earl of Warwick, and claimed the crown, were\r\ndefeated by Henry VII. John de la Pole, the earl of Lincoln, and most of\r\nthe leaders were slain; and Simnel, whose life was spared, was\r\nafterwards employed in the king’s household.\r\n\r\n=Stone Arabia.= See _Palatine_.\r\n\r\n=Stone Fougass=. See _Fougass, Stone_.\r\n\r\n=Stone River, Battle of.= See MURFREESBORO’.\r\n\r\n=Stone-bow.= A cross-bow formerly used or designed for throwing stones.\r\n\r\n=Stone-mortar.= Was a mortar which was used to throw stones a short\r\ndistance, from 150 to 250 yards; and also 6-pounder shells from 50 to\r\n150 yards.

Y., on the west bank of the\r\nHudson River, at the head of Haverstraw Bay, 42 miles north of New York.\r\nThe capture of the fort at this place by Gen. Wayne, on July 16, 1779,\r\nis justly considered one of the most brilliant exploits performed during\r\nthe Revolutionary war. The fortifications were destroyed and abandoned\r\non July 18.\r\n\r\n=Stoppage of Pay.= Where pay is stopped on account of arrears to the\r\nUnited States, the party whose pay is stopped may demand a suit, and the\r\nagent of the treasury is required to institute a suit within sixty days\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\n=Stoppages.= In the British service, are the deductions from a soldier’s\r\npay, the better to provide him with necessaries, etc.; also stoppage for\r\nthe subsistence of the sick.\r\n\r\n=Store-keeper, Military.= An officer specially appointed for the care of\r\nmilitary stores. The law discontinues this grade in the U. S. service by\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\n=Stores, Military.= The arms, ammunition, clothing, provisions, etc.,\r\npertaining to an army, is so called.

It was founded in 1209 by Prince\r\nJaromar of Rügen, became a member of the Hanse, and rapidly rose into\r\nimportance. During the Thirty Years’ War, it was unsuccessfully besieged\r\n(1628) by Wallenstein; and after being, with some alternations of\r\nfortune, in the possession of Sweden for about 200 years, it finally\r\npassed to Prussia in 1815.\r\n\r\n=Strappado.= A punishment formerly inflicted upon foreign soldiers by\r\nhoisting them up with their arms tied behind them, and then suddenly\r\nletting them down within a certain distance of the earth.\r\n\r\n=Strapped Ammunition.= See ORDNANCE, AMMUNITION FOR.\r\n\r\n=Straps.= Are decorations made of worsted, silk, gold, or silver, and\r\nworn upon the shoulders, without epaulette.\r\n\r\n=Strasbourg=, or =Strassburg=. Formerly a fortified town of France, and\r\ncapital of the department of Bas-Rhin, but in 1871 ceded to Germany, and\r\ncapital of the province of Alsace, not far from the left bank of the\r\nRhine, 312 miles east from Paris by railway. During the Middle Ages it\r\nwas subject to the German emperors, and was the capital of Alsace, but\r\nalong with that province it was ceded to Louis XIV. in 1681.\r\nSubsequently its defenses were greatly improved under the direction of\r\nVauban. Strasbourg was invested by the Germans, principally from Baden,\r\nduring the Franco-Prussian war, August 10, 1870. Gen. von Werder assumed\r\nthe command of the besiegers, and the bombardment began August 14, and a\r\nvigorous sally was repulsed August 16. Gen. Uhrich, the commander,\r\ndeclared that he would not surrender except upon a heap of ashes. After\r\na heroic resistance, and when a breach had been made and an assault was\r\nimpending, notice was given September 27, and the place surrendered at 2\r\nA.M., September 28; at 8 A.M. 17,150 men and 400 officers laid down\r\ntheir arms. The German loss was said to be 906 men, of whom 43 were\r\nofficers. The Germans entered Strasbourg, September 30, the anniversary\r\nof its surrender to the French in 1681 by a surprise. Uhrich received\r\nthe grand cross of the Legion of Honor, October, 1870. About 400 houses\r\nand the invaluable library were destroyed, the cathedral injured, and\r\n8000 persons rendered homeless.\r\n\r\n=Stratagem.= In war, is any scheme or plan for the deceiving and\r\nsurprising an army, or any body of men.\r\n\r\n=Stratarithmetry.= The art of drawing up an army, or any given number of\r\nmen, in any geometrical figure, or of estimating or expressing the\r\nnumber of men in such a figure.\r\n\r\n=Strategetics.= The science of military movements; generalship.\r\n\r\n=Strategic=, or =Strategical=.

That part which is directly in front of an army, or which\r\ncan be reached in two or three days, forms simply a _front_. When the\r\nwhole extent lying between the two hostile armies is considered, the\r\nterm _strategical front_ is applied.\r\n\r\n=Strategical Lines.= See LINES, STRATEGICAL.\r\n\r\n=Strategical Points.= Every point of the theatre of war, the possession\r\nof which is of great importance to an army in its military operations,\r\nis a _strategical point_. These are points which an army acting on the\r\noffensive strives to gain and the army on the defensive strives to\r\nretain.\r\n\r\n=Strategist.= One skilled in strategy, or the science of directing great\r\nmilitary movements.\r\n\r\n=Strategos= (invented by Lieut. C. A. L. Totten, 4th U. S. Artillery).\r\nThe American “game of war,” which takes its name from the Greek word\r\n_strategos_, the title of an Athenian general officer, derived in turn\r\nfrom _stratos_, “an army,” and _ago_, “I lead;” the secondary meaning of\r\nthis term being a board or council of ten Athenians chosen annually to\r\nconduct the war department at home. The game of _strategos_ is divided\r\ninto six separate ones, or studies, of gradually increasing importance,\r\nand is far more comprehensive than the foreign war games, which have\r\nlittle in common with the subaltern and the student, and are so\r\ncomplicated as to excite interest only among the most profound and\r\nadvanced scholars of military science. The six parts of _strategos_ are:\r\n(1) The “minor tactical game,” which embraces all the details of the\r\ntactics of each of the three arms. (2) “Grand tactics,” embracing the\r\ntopographical and strategical game, for the general elucidation of the\r\ngrand principles of this branch of military science. (3) The “historical\r\ngame,” for the study of historical battles and campaigns. (4) “Text-book\r\nillustration.” (5) A “battle game,” based upon military principles and\r\nprecepts, which is calculated to instruct as well as interest without\r\nfatiguing that large class of students whose patience would not stand\r\nthe close application required in a more advanced game. (6) The\r\n“advanced game,” which affords to the professional military student\r\nevery opportunity for pursuing studies commenced in more elementary\r\nfields to their legitimate termination. It is only in the “advanced\r\ngame” that _strategos_ solves the same problem attempted by the Germans\r\nin _kriegspiel_, and other military nations in various alterations and\r\nimprovements upon the great original. War games are by no means of such\r\nmodern invention as may at first appear; chess is a very ancient “battle\r\ngame,” and checkers one in which decisive concentration plays a most\r\nimportant part. During the last century two games, the _jeu de la\r\nguerre_ and the _jeu de la fortification_, appeared in France and were\r\nplayed with cards. These games differ, however, entirely from the modern\r\nones. Kriegspiel, the father of modern war games, was the invention of a\r\ncivilian, Herr von Reitwitz, the details of which his son, a Prussian\r\nartillery officer, carefully improved. It rapidly grew into military\r\nfavor, and since 1824, when it was first mentioned by officers of note,\r\nhas undergone many modifications except as to its underlying principles.\r\nVon Moltke himself some twenty years ago was the president of a society\r\nwhose special object was to play this game, and the great skill of\r\nPrussian officers and their success in their late wars is in no small\r\ndegree to be attributed to this game, familiarity with which has become\r\na sort of necessary step in advancement in the Prussian army. The\r\nAmerican game possesses all the valuable features of kriegspiel, and\r\nsome noticeable improvements thereon as to method, men, tables, etc.,\r\nwhile it possesses the peculiar advantages of having elementary games of\r\nspecial interest to all classes of military men. The cost of this game\r\nis about $50.\r\n\r\n=Strategus= (_Strategos_). Any Athenian general officer was so called.\r\n\r\n=Strategy.= Is defined by military writers to be the science of\r\nmanœuvring an army out of fire of the enemy, as tactics is the art of\r\nmanaging it in battle or under fire. Strategy is the greater science, as\r\nincluding all those vast combinations which lead to the subsequent\r\navailable displays of tactics.\r\n\r\nA movement of the army is said to be _strategical_ when by its means\r\nthere are concentrated at a given point troops superior in numbers to\r\nthose of the enemy; or, at this point, there is gained a position by\r\nwhich the enemy’s communications with his base are cut or threatened\r\nwhile those of the army are secure; or, a position is gained by which\r\nthe forces of the enemy are separated, or are prevented from acting in\r\nconcert. Strategical operations are directed to attain one or more of\r\nthese objects; and the line followed by an army in an operation of this\r\nkind is called a _strategical line_. The area of country or territory in\r\nany part of which the hostile forces can come into collision is termed\r\nthe _theatre of war_.\r\n\r\nThere may be employed in a given theatre of war several armies or only\r\none. If there are several armies, but each acting independently of the\r\nothers, or if there is only one, the particular portion of the territory\r\nin which each act is termed the _theatre of operations_ for that army.\r\n\r\nA theatre of operations of an army may be defined to be all the\r\nterritory it may desire to invade, and all that it may have to defend.\r\nWhere several armies are employed, acting in concert, the theatre of\r\noperations of each army depends upon the movements of the other armies,\r\nand the theatres of operations of each army in this case are usually\r\ndesignated as _zones of operations_; although this term is also applied\r\nto those three divisions of a theatre of operations lying directly in\r\nadvance of the centre and flanks of a front of operations. Whatever is\r\ntrue for a theatre of operations of an army acting alone is equally true\r\nfor the theatre of operations of several armies acting separately, and\r\nis also applicable to the whole theatre of war.\r\n\r\nTo make the above statements definite, suppose a single army acting in\r\nan independent theatre of operations. A general with such an army under\r\nhis command proposing an advance towards the enemy will have three\r\nthings to consider, viz.: (1) The place from which the army is to start;\r\n(2) The point to which the army is to go; (3) The roads or routes by\r\nwhich the army is to move in order to reach this point. The first, or\r\nplace of starting, is termed the _base of operations_. The second, the\r\npoint to be reached, is called the _objective-point_, or simply the\r\n_objective_. The third, the roads or routes used by the army in reaching\r\nthe objective-point, is termed the _line of operations_. The portion of\r\nthe theatre of operations occupied by the army as it advances is known\r\nas the _front of operations_.\r\n\r\n=Stratton-Hill, Battle of.= In Cornwall, England, May 16, 1643, between\r\nthe royal army under Sir Ralph Hopton, and the forces of the Parliament\r\nunder the Earl of Stamford. The victory was gained over the\r\nParliamentarians, who lost heavily in killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n=Strelitz=, or properly =Streltzi= (“arquebuzziers”). The ancient\r\nRussian militia-guard, first raised by Ivan Vatsilevitch the Terrible,\r\nin the second half of the 16th century. At that time and for long\r\nafterwards, they were the only standing army in Russia, and at times\r\namounted to between 40,000 and 50,000 men. They were located at Moscow\r\nin time of peace, in a quarter of the Capitol which was set apart for\r\nthem, and being the bravest and most trustworthy troops in the army,\r\nwere made objects of special favor and distinctions. But like all such\r\npetted corps, the Roman _Prætorians_, the Turkish Janissaries, and the\r\nEgyptian Mamelukes, their general turbulence, frequent revolts against\r\nthe government (notably during the Demetrian insurrections), and\r\nincessant conspiracies, rendered them more formidable to the Russian\r\ngovernment than to external enemies. The Strelitz having, at the\r\ninstigation of the Grand Duchess Sophia and the chiefs of the Old\r\nMuscovite party, revolted against Peter the Great, that iron-handed\r\nruler caused them to be decimated (1698) in the great square of Moscow,\r\nand the remainder to be banished to Astrakhan. The feeble remnant still\r\nmanifesting their characteristic turbulence and disloyalty, Peter\r\nexterminated them almost completely in 1705. Few Russian families at\r\npresent can claim kindred with the old Strelitz, but to this the family\r\nof Orloff forms a prominent exception, being descended from a Strelitz\r\nwho was pardoned by Peter the Great while the axe was being raised over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n=Strength.= This word may be variously understood in military matters.\r\nIt means fortification; strongholds, etc. It likewise signifies\r\narmament; power; force. In all returns which are made of corps,\r\n_strength_ implies the number of men that are borne upon the\r\nestablishment, in contradistinction to _effective force_, which means\r\nthe number fit for service.\r\n\r\n=Stretcher.= A litter or frame for carrying sick, wounded, or dead\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n=Strict.= Exact, severe, rigorous; the contrary to mild, indulgent.\r\nHence, a strict officer. It is sometimes used in a bad sense, to signify\r\na petulant, troublesome commander.\r\n\r\n=Striegau.= A town of Prussia in Silesia, 29 miles southwest from\r\nBreslau. The Austrians were defeated by the Prussians under Frederick\r\nthe Great near this town in 1745.\r\n\r\n=Strife.= Contention in battle;, contest; struggle for victory; quarrel\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n=Strike.= This word is variously used in military phraseology; as, to\r\n_strike a tent_, is to loosen the cords of a tent which has been\r\nregularly pitched, and to have it ready, in a few minutes, to throw upon\r\na baggage-wagon. _To strike terror into an enemy_, is to cause alarm and\r\napprehension in him; to make him dread the effects of superior skill and\r\nvalor. _To strike a blow_, to make some decisive effort.\r\n\r\n=Stripes.= The chevrons on the coats of non-commissioned officers are\r\nsometimes so called.\r\n\r\n=Strong.= Well fortified; able to sustain attacks; not easily subdued or\r\ntaken; as, a strong fortress or town. Having great military or naval\r\nforce; powerful; as, a strong army or fleet; a nation strong at sea.\r\n\r\n=Stronghold.= A fastness; a fort or fortress; a fortified place; a place\r\nof security.\r\n\r\n=Struggle, To.= To make extraordinary exertion in direct contest with an\r\nenemy, or against superior forces.\r\n\r\n=Stuhlweissenburg.= A town of Austria, in Hungary, 37 miles southwest\r\nfrom Buda-Pesth. It was besieged and taken from the Turks by the\r\nAustrians under the Duke of Mercoeur, in September, 1601; was besieged\r\nand captured by the Turks in August, 1602; and was besieged and taken by\r\nassault by the Austrians on September 6, 1688.\r\n\r\n=Stuhm.= A town of West Prussia, 13 miles north-northeast of\r\nMarienwerder. Here a battle was fought between the Swedes under Gustavus\r\nAdolphus and the Poles under Gen. Koniecpolski, June 17, 1629.\r\n\r\n=Stuttgart=, or =Stutgard=. The capital of Würtemberg, Germany, 38 miles\r\neast-southeast from Carlsruhe. During the wars of Louis XIV., Stuttgart\r\nwas thrice taken; and again in 1796, 1800, and 1801.\r\n\r\n=Stylet.= A small poniard or dagger; a stiletto.\r\n\r\n=Styra= (now _Stura_). A town in Eubœa, on the southwest coast, nearly\r\nopposite Marathon in Attica. The inhabitants took an active part in the\r\nPersian war, and fought at Artemisium, Salamis, and Platææ. They\r\nafterwards became subject to the Athenians. The town was destroyed in\r\nthe Lamian war by the Athenian general Phædrus, and its territory was\r\nannexed to Eretia.\r\n\r\n=Suabia=, =Swabia=, or =Suevia= (Ger. _Schwaben_). An ancient duchy in\r\nthe southwest of Germany, so named from a horde of Suevi, who spread\r\nover it in the 5th century; was a great duchy of the Frank empire till\r\nthe 8th century. In 918, it was acknowledged a ducal fief of the empire;\r\nand after changing hands several times, it was bestowed upon Count\r\nFrederick of Hohenstaufen, the founder of the illustrious house of that\r\nname, also known as the house of Suabia. Under the rule of this prince,\r\nSuabia became the most rich, civilized, and powerful country of Germany;\r\nbut the wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and the quarrel with the\r\nFrench respecting Naples, put an end to the dynasty in 1268. The ducal\r\nvassals of Suabia rendered themselves almost independent, and professed\r\nto acknowledge no lord but the emperor. During these dissensions arose\r\nthe lordships of Würtemberg and Baden, with numerous lesser states,\r\nholding direct of the crown, and opposed to them the cities, which\r\nstrove also for an equal independence, and obtained, in 1347, great\r\nadditional privileges. A number of them united to make common cause\r\nagainst the neighboring feudal lords in 1376 (known as the “First\r\nSuabian League”); an opposite league was formed between Würtemberg,\r\nBaden, and seventeen towns in 1405, called the “League of Marbach”; and\r\nboth took part in the war of Swiss independence, the former in support\r\nof the Swiss, the latter of the Austrians. At last the towns, which had\r\nbeen increasing in power, decided at Ulm, in 1449, to form a standing\r\narmy, and a permanent military commission, for the forcible\r\npreservation, if necessary, of peace and order; and the Count of\r\nWürtemberg, the most powerful of the opposite party, having joined them,\r\nwas appointed military chief of the league, which ultimately grew up\r\ninto the “Great Suabian League,” which effectively repressed feudal\r\nquarrels. In 1512, Suabia became one of the ten circles into which\r\nGermany was now divided, received its complete organization in 1563, and\r\nretained it almost without change till the dissolution of the empire in\r\n1806. But during this period, the wars of the towns with Würtemberg, the\r\nPeasants’ war, of which Suabia was one of the foci, the Thirty Years’\r\nWar, and those between France and the empire, destroyed the democratic\r\nconstitution of the towns, and with it their energy, and then their\r\nprosperity disappeared, leaving now no relic which could suggest their\r\nformer great importance.\r\n\r\n=Subadar.= A native officer in a native East Indian infantry regiment\r\nholding a rank corresponding to that of captain.\r\n\r\n=Subadar-Major.= In the East Indies, is the native commandant of a\r\nnative infantry regiment.\r\n\r\n=Subaltern.= A commissioned officer below the rank of captain. But\r\nstrictly speaking every officer is a subaltern to the grades above him,\r\nas the captain is subaltern to the major, and so upward.\r\n\r\n=Sub-Brigadier.= An officer in the Horse Guards who ranks as cornet.\r\n\r\n=Subdivision.= The parts of a regiment on parade distinguished by a\r\nsecond division. Thus, a company divided forms two subdivisions.\r\n\r\n=Subdue.= To bring under; to conquer by force or the exertion of\r\nsuperior power, and bring into permanent subjection; to reduce under\r\ndominion. To overpower so as to disable from further resistance; to\r\ncrush.\r\n\r\n=Subdur.= In the East Indies signifies a chief.\r\n\r\n=Subjugate.= To subdue and bring under the yoke of power or dominion; to\r\nconquer by force, and compel to submit to the government or absolute\r\ncontrol of another.\r\n\r\n=Sub-Lieutenant.= In the British service, is the lowest commissioned\r\nrank in infantry and cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Subordinary=, or =Subordinate Ordinary=. In heraldry, a name given to a\r\ncertain class of charges mostly formed of straight or curved lines.\r\nHeralds vary a little in their enumeration, but the following are\r\ngenerally held to come within this category: the Bordure, the Orle, the\r\nTressure, the Flanche, the Pile, the Pall, the Quarter, the Canton, the\r\nGyron, the Fret, the Inescutcheon, the Lozenge, the Fusil, and the\r\nMascle. Some heraldic writers account the Pile an ordinary, and the\r\ndiminutives of the ordinaries are sometimes ranked as subordinaries.\r\n\r\n=Subordination.= A perfect submission to the orders of superiors; a\r\nperfect dependence, regulated by the rights and duties of every military\r\nman, from the soldier to the general. Subordination should show the\r\nspirit of the chief in all the members; and this single idea, which is\r\nmanifest to the dullest apprehension, suffices to show its importance.\r\nWithout subordination it is impossible that a corps can support itself;\r\nthat its motions can be directed, order established, or the service\r\ncarried on. In effect, it is subordination that gives a soul and harmony\r\nto the service; it adds strength to authority, and merit to obedience;\r\nand while it secures the efficacy of command, reflects honor upon its\r\nexecution. It is subordination which prevents every disorder, and\r\nprocures every advantage to an army.\r\n\r\n=Subsidy.= A stipulated sum of money, paid by one prince to another in\r\npursuance of a treaty of alliance for offensive or defensive war.\r\n_Subsidiary troops_, are the troops of a nation assisting those of\r\nanother, for a given sum or subsidy.\r\n\r\n=Subsist.= To support with provisions; to feed; to maintain.\r\n\r\n=Subsistence.= This word may be divided into two sorts, namely, that\r\nspecies of subsistence which is found in an adjacent country, such as\r\nforage, and frequently corn; and that which is provided at a distance,\r\nand regularly supplied by means of a well-conducted commissary. The\r\nlatter consists chiefly of meat, bread, etc. To these may be added wood\r\nor coals, and straw; which are always wanted in an army.\r\n\r\n=Subsistence Department.= A department which provides subsistence stores\r\nfor the army, either by contract or purchase. The U. S. subsistence\r\ndepartment consists of 1 brigadier-general, 2 colonels, 3\r\nlieutenant-colonels, 8 majors, and 12 captains. See COMMISSARIAT.\r\n\r\n=Substitute, Military.= In nations where conscription is resorted to for\r\nthe supply of soldiers for the army, the lot often falls on those\r\nunwilling to serve in person. In such a case, the state agrees to accept\r\nthe services of a substitute,--that is, of a person of equally good\r\nphysique. Unless the levy be very extensive, or the term of military\r\nservice very long, substitutes are readily found among military men who\r\nhave already served their prescribed period. Of course, the substitute\r\nmust be paid for the risk he runs. His price depends, like all other\r\nsalable articles, on the demand and supply.\r\n\r\n=Succeedant.= In heraldry, succeeding one another, following.\r\n\r\n=Success of Arms.= The good luck, or fortune, which attends military\r\noperations, and upon which the fate of a nation frequently depends.\r\nSuccess is indispensable to the reputation of a general. It often\r\nhallows rash and unauthorized measures.\r\n\r\n=Succession of Rank.= Relative gradation according to the dates of\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n=Succession Wars.= These wars were of frequent occurrence in Europe,\r\nbetween the middle of the 17th and the middle of the 18th centuries, on\r\nthe occasion of the failure of a sovereign house. The most important of\r\nthese was that of the Orleans succession to the Palatinate (1686-97),\r\nclosed by the peace of Ryswick; of the Spanish succession (1700-13),\r\nwhich was distinguished by the achievements of the Duke of Marlborough\r\nand the Earl of Peterborough, and their unprofitable results, arose on\r\nthe question whether an Austrian prince or a French prince should\r\nsucceed to the throne of Spain; of the Polish succession (1733-38),\r\nclosed by the peace of Vienna; of the Austrian succession (1740-48); and\r\nof the Bavarian succession (1777-79), called, in ridicule, the Potato\r\nwar. Of these, the second and fourth were by far the most important.\r\n\r\n=Successive Pontons.= See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Sudbury.= A town in Middlesex Co., Mass., 20 miles west by north from\r\nBoston. A battle was fought here on April 18, 1776, in which Capt. S.\r\nWadsworth and two-thirds of his men were killed by the Indians, in King\r\nPhilip’s war.\r\n\r\n=Suessiones=, or =Suessones=. A powerful people in Gallia Belgica, who\r\nwere reckoned the bravest of all the Belgic Gauls after the Bellovaci,\r\nand who could bring 50,000 men into the field in Cæsar’s time. Their\r\nking Divitiacus, shortly before Cæsar’s arrival in the country, was\r\nreckoned the most powerful chief in all Gaul, and had extended his\r\nsovereignty even over Britain. The Suessiones dwelt in an extensive and\r\nfertile country east of the Bellovaci, south of the Veromandui, and west\r\nof the Remi. They possessed twelve towns, of which the capital was\r\nNoviodunum, subsequently Augusta Suessonum, or Suessones.\r\n\r\n=Suevi.= One of the greatest and most powerful races of Germany, or,\r\nmore properly speaking, the collective name of a great number of German\r\ntribes, who were grouped together on account of their migratory mode of\r\nlife, and spoken of in opposition to the more settled tribes, who went\r\nunder the general name of Ingævones. The Suevi are described by all the\r\nancient writers as occupying the greater half of all Germany; but the\r\naccounts vary respecting the part of the country which they inhabited.\r\nAt a later time the collective name of the Suevi gradually disappeared.\r\nIn the second half of the 2d century, however, we again find a people\r\ncalled Suevi, dwelling between the mouth of the Main and the Black\r\nForest, whose name is still preserved in the modern Suabia; but this\r\npeople was only a body of bold adventurers from various German tribes,\r\nwho assumed the celebrated name of the Suevi in consequence of their not\r\npossessing any distinguishing appellation.\r\n\r\n=Suisses= (_Fr._). The Swiss soldiers who were in the pay of France\r\nprevious to August 10, 1792, were generally so called. It was also a\r\ngeneral term to signify stipendiary troops.\r\n\r\n=Suliots.= A people in and around the valley of Acheron, the southern\r\ncorner of the pashalic of Janina (_Epirus_), in Turkey in Europe, are a\r\nmixed race, being partly of Hellenic and partly of Albanian origin. They\r\nare the descendants of a number of families who fled from the Turkish\r\noppressors to the mountains of Suli (whence they derive their name)\r\nduring the 17th century. In this obscure corner of the Turkish empire\r\nthey prospered, and towards the close of the 18th century numbered 560\r\nfamilies. For about fifteen years they heroically resisted the\r\nencroachments of Ali Pasha of Janina upon their independence, the very\r\nwomen taking part in the strife. Vanquished in 1803, they retreated to\r\nParga, and afterwards to the Ionian Islands, where they remained till\r\n1820, when their old oppressor, Ali Pasha, finding himself hard pressed\r\nby the Turks, invoked their aid. Eager to return to their cherished\r\nhome, they accepted his terms, and under Marcos Bozzaris maintained a\r\nlong and desperate conflict with the Turks, but were ultimately forced\r\nagain to flee from their country, and take refuge to the number of 3000\r\nin Cephalonia, though a large remnant preferred to skulk in the\r\nneighboring mountains. Though, after this, they took an active and\r\nglorious part in the war of Greek independence, their country was not\r\nincluded by the treaty of 1829 within the Greek boundary-line, but many\r\nof them, as Bozzaris (son of Marcos) and Tzavellas, have since been\r\nraised to important political offices in the new kingdom of Greece.\r\n\r\n=Sulphur.= A simple mineral substance, of a yellow color, brittle,\r\ninsoluble in water, easily fusible and inflammable;--called also\r\n_brimstone_,--that is, _burn-stone_, from its great combustibility. It\r\nburns with a blue flame and a peculiar suffocating odor. It is an\r\ningredient of gunpowder (which see).\r\n\r\n=Sultan=, or =Sultaun=. An Arabic word signifying the “mighty man,” and\r\nevidently closely connected with the Hebrew word _shalal_, “to rule,” is\r\nin the East an ordinary title of Mohammedan princes. It is given, _par\r\nexcellence_, to the supreme head of the Ottoman empire. It is applied in\r\nEgypt to the ruler of that country, and is also retained by the heir of\r\nthe former reigning line of the Crim-Tartars. _Sultana_ is the title of\r\nthe wife of a sultan.\r\n\r\n=Sumatra.= The most westerly of the Sunda Islands, lies southwest of the\r\nMalay peninsula, from which it is separated by the Strait of Malacca.\r\nWhen the Portuguese landed here, in 1509, they found that the ancient\r\nMalay kingdom of Menangcabau had been dissolved; but there was a\r\npowerful monarch ruling over Acheen, who endeavored to exclude the\r\nstrangers from his country. In 1575, the Portuguese shipping in the\r\nharbor of Acheen was destroyed by the natives, and in 1582, an attempt\r\nwhich they made to gain possession of the town proved quite\r\nunsuccessful. In 1600, the Dutch established a factory at Pulo Chinko,\r\non the west coast. The kingdom of Acheen had by this time begun to\r\ndecline in power, being distracted by internal wars and discords: The\r\nDutch rapidly increased the number of their factories and settlements,\r\nfounding one at Padang in 1649, at Palembang in 1664. The English\r\nfollowed the Dutch in this island, and founded a colony at Bencoolen in\r\n1685. In 1811, the Dutch settlements in the East Indies fell into the\r\nhands of the British, but were restored to the Dutch by the peace of\r\n1816. A singular war which took place in Sumatra led to a material\r\nextension of the Dutch possession. It was occasioned by a religious sect\r\ncalled Padries. About 1815 a society of this sect was formed for the\r\npurpose of spreading their doctrines and practices by force; and this\r\nspeedily roused resistance and opposition. The Malays and Battas made\r\ncommon cause against the Padries, and for a long time a fierce struggle\r\nwas carried on, which devastated Menangcabau and the neighboring\r\nregions. At length, with the assistance of the Dutch, the sect was\r\nentirely put down. The indirect results of this war were the annexation\r\nof Menangcabau to the Dutch possessions in 1835, and the opening up to\r\nthem of the Batta country, from which foreigners had previously been\r\nexcluded. In 1865, an expedition was sent to force the king of Asahan,\r\none of the small states on the northeast coast, to submit to the Dutch\r\nauthority. In 1871 these settlements were sold to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n=Summon.= To call upon to surrender; as, to summon a fort.\r\n\r\n=Summons.= A call or invitation to surrender.\r\n\r\n=Sumpit.= An arrow blown from the _sumpitan_ in Borneo. The sumpitan is\r\nabout 7 feet long; the arrow has been driven with some force at 130\r\nyards. Some suppose it to be poison.\r\n\r\n=Sumter, Fort.= See FORT SUMTER.\r\n\r\n=Suncion, Treaty of.= Between Gen. Urquiza, director of the Argentine\r\nConfederation, and C. A. Lopez, president of the republic of Paraguay,\r\nrecognizing the independence of Paraguay, July 15, 1852.\r\n\r\n=Superannuated.= Incapacitated for service, either from age or\r\ninfirmity, and placed on a pension.\r\n\r\n=Supercharge.= In heraldry, a bearing or figure placed upon another.\r\n\r\n=Superintendent.= One who has the oversight and charge of something,\r\nwith the power of direction; as the superintendent of recruiting\r\nservice; superintendent of national cemeteries, etc.\r\n\r\n=Superior Officer.= Any officer of higher rank, or who has priority in\r\nthe same rank, by the date of his commission, etc.\r\n\r\n=Superior Slope.= The upper surface of a parapet.\r\n\r\n=Supernumerary.= Officers or men in excess of the establishment, but\r\nborne on the rolls of the corps till absorbed. _Supernumeraries_, or\r\n_supernumerary rank_, also signifies the officers and non-commissioned\r\nofficers in the infantry, cavalry, etc., who are not included among rank\r\nand file, and stand in the third rank on parade, when the troops are\r\ndrawn up in double ranks.\r\n\r\n=Supersede.= Is to deprive an officer of rank and pay for any offense or\r\nneglect, or to place one officer over the head of another, who may or\r\nmay not be more deserving.\r\n\r\n=Supply.= Relief of want; making up deficiencies. A fresh supply of\r\ntroops, ammunition, etc. _To supply_, to make up deficiencies. To aid;\r\nto assist; to relieve with something wanted. To fill any room made\r\nvacant. Thus, covering sergeants supply the places of officers when they\r\nstep out of the ranks, or are killed in action.\r\n\r\n=Support.= To aid, to assist; it likewise signifies to preserve\r\nuntarnished; as, to support the ancient character of a corps. _Well\r\nsupported_, is well aided or assisted. It likewise signifies well kept\r\nup; as, a well supported fire from the batteries; a well supported fire\r\nof musketry.\r\n\r\n=Support Arms.= Is to hold the musket vertically on the left shoulder,\r\nsupported by having the hammer rest on the left forearm, which is passed\r\nacross the breast.\r\n\r\n=Supporters.= In heraldry, figures placed on each side of an armorial\r\nshield, as it were to support it. They seem to have been, in their\r\norigin, a purely decorative invention of mediæval seal-engravers, often,\r\nhowever, bearing allusion to the arms or descent of the bearer; but in\r\nthe course of time their use came to be regulated by authority, and they\r\nwere considered indicative that the bearer was the head of a family of\r\neminence or distinction. The most usual supporters are animals, real or\r\nfabulous; but men in armor are also frequent, and savages, or naked men,\r\noften represented with clubs, and wreathed about the head and middle.\r\nThere are occasional instances of inanimate supporters. On early seals,\r\na single supporter is not unfrequent, and instances are particularly\r\ncommon of the escutcheon being placed on the breast of an eagle\r\ndisplayed. The common rule, however, has been to have a supporter on\r\neach side of the shield. The dexter supporter is very often repeated on\r\nthe sinister side; but the two supporters are in many cases different;\r\nwhen the bearer represents two different families, it is not unusual for\r\na supporter to be adopted from the achievement of each.\r\n\r\n=Suppress.= To overpower and crush; to subdue; to put down; to quell; to\r\ndestroy; as, the troops suppressed the rebellion.\r\n\r\n=Surat.= A large but declining city of British India, 150 miles north of\r\nthe city of Bombay, on the south shore of the Tapti, and 8 miles from\r\nits mouth in the Gulf of Cambay. Surat was sacked in 1512 by the\r\nPortuguese soon after their arrival in India. In 1612 an English force\r\narrived here in two vessels, under the command of Capt. Best, who\r\ndefeated the Portuguese, and obtained a _firman_ from the Mogul emperor,\r\nauthorizing the residence of a British minister, and established a\r\nfactory. An attack of the Mahratta chief Sivajee on the British factory\r\nwas defeated by Sir George Oxenden, 1664. The English were again\r\nattacked in 1670 and 1702, and often subsequently. The East India\r\nCompany, in 1759, fitted out an armament which dispossessed the admiral\r\nof the castle (the Great Mogul had here an officer who was styled his\r\nadmiral); and, soon after, the possession of this castle was confirmed\r\nto them by the court of Delhi. Surat was vested in the British by treaty\r\nin 1800 and 1803.\r\n\r\n=Surcingle.= A belt, band, or girth, which passes over a saddle, or over\r\nanything laid on a horse’s back, to bind it fast.\r\n\r\n=Surcoat.= A short coat worn over the other garments; especially the\r\nlong and flowing drapery of knights, anterior to the introduction of\r\nplate-armor, and which was frequently emblazoned with the arms of a\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n=Surface.= In fortification, that part of the side which is terminated\r\nby the flank prolonged, and the angle of the nearest bastion; the double\r\nof this line with the curtain is equal to the exterior side.\r\n\r\n=Surgeon.= A staff-officer of the medical department. He has the rank of\r\nmajor, but “shall not in virtue of such rank be entitled to command in\r\nthe line or other staff departments of the army.”\r\n\r\n=Surgeon-General.= The chief of the medical department, with the rank of\r\nbrigadier-general, but subject to the same restriction of command as\r\nother officers of the medical department.\r\n\r\n=Surgeons, Acting Assistant-= (Contract). In the U. S. army, are\r\nphysicians employed from civil life, at a certain compensation, to\r\nperform the duties required of commissioned medical officers, when the\r\nnumber of the latter is insufficient. While they have no rank they still\r\nhave the allowances of an assistant-surgeon (first lieutenant). A\r\nphysician so employed cannot displace a commissioned officer by choice\r\nof quarters; but to obviate being displaced by a commissioned officer,\r\nthe commanding officer of a post may assign him an allowance of first\r\nlieutenant’s quarters near the hospital, under the provisions\r\nauthorizing the commanding officer to assign quarters to officers\r\nconvenient to their troops. Acting assistant-surgeons are entitled to\r\nthe same protection and respectful conduct from enlisted men as\r\ncommissioned officers are, so far as relates to their duties as\r\nsurgeons. A contract physician in the army is regarded as a\r\n“quasi-officer.”\r\n\r\n=Surgery, Military.= Restricted to its rigorous signification, military\r\nsurgery is the surgical practice in armies; but in its broad and\r\nordinary acceptation embraces many other branches of art comprehending\r\nthe practice of medicine, sanitary precautions, hospital administration,\r\nambulances, etc. The military surgeon must not only be a skillful\r\nphysician and surgeon, but he must have a constitution sufficiently\r\nstrong to resist the fatigues of war, and all inclemencies of weather; a\r\nsolid judgment and a generous activity in giving prompt assistance to\r\nthe wounded without distinction of rank or grade, and without even\r\nexcluding enemies. He must have the courage to face dangers without the\r\npower, in all cases, of combating them; he must have great coolness in\r\norder to act and operate in the most difficult positions, whether amidst\r\nthe movement of troops, the shock of arms, the cries of the wounded when\r\ncrowded together, in a charge, in a retreat, in intrenchments, under the\r\nramparts of a besieged place, or at a breach. He must have inventive\r\ningenuity which will supply the wants of the wounded in extreme cases,\r\nand a compassionate heart, with strength of will which will inspire\r\nconfidence in those with whom he is brought so closely in contact. The\r\nmilitary surgeon, with his flying ambulance, throws himself into the\r\nfield of battle, through the mêlée, under the fire of the enemy, runs\r\nthe risk of being taken prisoner, being wounded, or being killed, and is\r\nworthy of all the honors that should be bestowed on bravery and skill in\r\nthe performance of his high functions. Additional grades, as\r\nhospital-surgeons, surgeons of divisions, surgeons-in-chief, and\r\ninspector-generals of hospitals, etc., are required for every army in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n=Surinam=, or =Dutch Guiana=. A Dutch colony in South America, situated\r\nbetween English and French Guiana. The factories established here by the\r\nEnglish in 1640, were occupied by the Portuguese in 1643; by the Dutch,\r\n1654; captured by the English in 1804; and restored to the Dutch in\r\n1814.\r\n\r\n=Surmounted.= In heraldry, a term used to indicate that one charge is to\r\nbe placed over another of different color or metal, which may\r\nrespectively be blazoned: _sable_, a pile argent surmounted by a chevron\r\ngules; and, _argent_, a cross gules surmounted by another or.\r\n\r\n=Surprise.= In war, to fall on an enemy unexpectedly, in marching\r\nthrough narrow and difficult passes, when one part of an army has\r\npassed, and is not able to come at once to the succor of the other; as\r\nin the passage of woods, rivers, inclosures, etc. A place is surprised\r\nby drains, casements, or the issues of rivers or canals; by encumbering\r\nthe bridge or gate, or by wagons meeting and stopping each other; or by\r\nsending soldiers into the place, under pretense of being deserters, who,\r\non entering, _surprise_ the guard, being sustained by troops at hand in\r\nambush, to whom they give entrance, and thereby seize the place.\r\nMilitary history abounds with instances of successful surprises.\r\n\r\n=Surrender.= To lay down your arms, and give yourself up as a prisoner\r\nof war. Also, the act of giving up, as the surrender of a town or\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\n=Surrey.= One of the smallest of the English counties, has the Thames\r\nfor its northern boundary, Berkshire and Hampshire on the west, Sussex\r\non the south, and Kent on the east. Before the Roman era, Surrey formed\r\na portion of the dominions of a Celtic tribe, named by Ptolemy the\r\n_Regni_, and after the Roman conquest was merged into the province of\r\nBritannica Prima, though, for many years, it retained its native\r\nprinces, or _subreguli_. Eventually it was swallowed up in the\r\nterritory of the South Saxons, and reduced by Kenulf, king of Wessex,\r\nabout 760, into that progressive kingdom which Alfred brought into\r\nconstitutional harmony and national completeness. From the period of the\r\nNorman conquest, Surrey can claim no separate annals. At Kingston,\r\nSurrey, in 1642, took place the first military movement of the great\r\ncivil war; a body of royalists unsuccessfully attempting to seize upon\r\nits magazine of arms. And there, on July 7, 1648, Lord Francis Villiers\r\n(Dryden’s “Zimri”), met his death in the skirmish which closed the\r\nfamous struggle.\r\n\r\n=Surround.= In sieges, to invest; in tactics, to outflank and cut off\r\nthe means of retreating.\r\n\r\n=Surrounded.= Inclosed; invested. A town is said to be surrounded when\r\nits principal outlets are blocked up; and an army, when its flanks are\r\nturned, and its retreat cut off.\r\n\r\n=Surtout= (_Fr._). In fortification, is the elevation of the parapet of\r\na work at the angles to protect from enfilade fire.\r\n\r\n=Survey, Boards of.= See BOARDS OF SURVEY.\r\n\r\n=Susa= (in the Old Testament _Shushan_; ruins at _Shus_). The winter\r\nresidence of the Persian kings, stood in the district Cissia of the\r\nprovince of Susiana, on the eastern bank of the river Choaspes. It was\r\nconquered by Antigonus in 315 B.C. It was once more attacked by Molo in\r\nhis rebellion against Antiochus the Great; and during the Arabian\r\nconquest of Persia it held out bravely for a long time, defended by\r\nHormuzan.\r\n\r\n=Suspend.= To delay, to protract; hence, to suspend hostilities. It is\r\nlikewise used to express the act of temporarily depriving an officer of\r\nrank and pay, in consequence of some offense. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF\r\nWAR, 101.\r\n\r\n=Suspension of Arms.= A short truce which contending parties agree upon,\r\nin order to bury their dead without danger or molestation, to wait for\r\nsuccors, or to receive instructions from a superior authority.\r\n_Suspension of hostilities_, to cease attacking one another.\r\n\r\n=Sussex.= A maritime county in the south of England. Ælla and his sons\r\nwere the first Saxons who landed on the Sussex coast, 477. They\r\nassaulted and captured Wittering, near Chichester, spreading afterwards\r\nthrough the vast _Andredsleas_ with fire and sword, and finally\r\nestablishing the South-Sexe, or Sussex kingdom. The sea-board of Sussex\r\nsuffered terribly from the ravages of the Danish jarls. Within its\r\nlimits was fought (October 14, 1066) the memorable battle which\r\noverthrew the Saxon dynasty, and eventually resulted in that union of\r\nSaxon solidity and Norman enterprise now recognized as distinctive of\r\nthe English character. See LEWES for important battle in 1264. The\r\nFrench fleet, under D’Annebaut, made an attack on Brighton in 1545, and\r\nlanded a body of troops, who were stoutly resisted by the natives, and\r\ncompelled to retire. In 1643, the Parliamentarian forces, under Sir\r\nWilliam Waller, besieged Chichester, which after ten days surrendered.\r\nThe same leader, later in the year, beleaguered Arundel Castle for\r\nseventeen days, and reduced it to a heap of ruins. For naval combat off\r\nthe Sussex coast, see BEACHY HEAD.\r\n\r\n=Sustain.= To sustain is to aid, succor, or support, any body of men in\r\naction or defense.\r\n\r\n=Sutherland.= A county in the extreme north of Scotland. Sutherland\r\nreceived its name from the Northmen, who frequently descended upon and\r\npillaged it prior to the 12th century, and called it the Southern Land,\r\nas being the limit on the south of their settlements.\r\n\r\n=Sutler.= A camp-follower, who sells drink and provisions to the troops.\r\nSee CANTEEN, and POST-TRADER.\r\n\r\n=Swad=, or =Swadkin=. A newly-raised soldier.\r\n\r\n=Swaddie.= A discharged soldier.\r\n\r\n=Swallow’s-tail.= In fortification, an outwork, differing from a single\r\ntenaille, as its sides are not parallel, like those of a tenaille; but\r\nif prolonged, would meet and form an angle on the middle of the curtain;\r\nand its head, or front, composed of faces, forming a re-entering angle.\r\n\r\n=Sway.= The swing or sweep of a weapon. “To strike with huge two-handed\r\nsway.”\r\n\r\n=Sweaborg=, or =Sveaborg=. A great Russian fortress and seaport, in\r\nFinland, government of Viborg, sometimes called “the Gibraltar of the\r\nNorth.” In 1789 it was taken from Sweden by Russia. During the Crimean\r\nwar it was bombarded by the Anglo-French fleet in the Baltic (on August\r\n9-10, 1855). Twenty-one mortar-vessels were towed to within about 2\r\nmiles (3400 metres) of the centre of the Russian arsenal, while the\r\ngunboats of the squadron, keeping in constant motion, approached to a\r\ndistance of 2000 or 3000 metres. The fire was maintained forty-five\r\nhours, during which 4150 projectiles (2828 of which were mortar-shells)\r\nwere thrown into the place, killing and wounding 2000 men, and\r\ndestroying magazines, supplies, and shipping.\r\n\r\n=Sweden.= A kingdom in the north of Europe, and forming with Norway\r\n(with which it is now united under one monarchy), the whole of the\r\npeninsula known by the name of Scandinavia. The earliest traditions of\r\nSweden, like those of most other countries, present only a mass of\r\nfables. The dawn of Swedish history (properly so called) now begins, and\r\nwe find the Swedes constantly at war with their neighbors of Norway and\r\nDenmark, and busily engaged in piratical enterprises against the eastern\r\nshores of the Baltic. In 1155, Eric, surnamed the Saint, undertook a\r\ncrusade against the pagan Finns, compelled them to submit, established\r\nSwedish settlements among them, and laid the foundation of the closer\r\nunion of Finland with Sweden. Eric’s defeat and murder, in 1161, by the\r\nambitious young Danish prince Magnus Henriksen, who had made an\r\nunprovoked attack upon the Swedish king, was the beginning of a long\r\nseries of troubles, and during the following 200 years, one short and\r\nstormy reign was brought to a violent end by murder or civil war, only\r\nto be succeeded by another equally short and disturbed; until, at\r\nlength, the throne was offered by the Swedish nobles to Margaret, queen\r\nof Denmark and Norway, who threw an army into Sweden, defeated the\r\nSwedish king, Albert of Mecklenburg, and by the union of Calmar, in\r\n1397, brought Sweden under one joint sceptre with Denmark and Norway.\r\nSweden emancipated itself from the union with Denmark in 1523. Gustavus\r\nI. (Gustaf Vasa) on his death, in 1560, left to his successor a\r\nhereditary and well-organized kingdom, a full exchequer, a standing\r\narmy, and a well-appointed navy. John, brother of Eric XIV., ascended\r\nthe throne in 1568, which he occupied for nearly a quarter of a century,\r\ndying in 1592, after a stormy reign, stained by the cruel murder of his\r\nunfortunate brother Eric, and distracted by the internal dissensions\r\narising from his attempts to force Catholicism on the people, and the\r\ndisastrous wars with the Danes, Poles, and Russians. John’s son and\r\nsuccessor, Sigismund, after a stormy reign of eight years, was compelled\r\nto resign the throne. The deposition of Sigismund gave rise to the\r\nSwedo-Polish war of succession, which continued from 1604 to 1660; and\r\non the death of Charles IX. in 1611, his son and successor, the great\r\nGustavus Adolphus, found himself involved in hostilities with Russia,\r\nPoland, and Denmark. With Charles XII. the male line of the Vasas\r\nexpired, and his sister and her husband, Frederick of Hesse-Cassel, were\r\ncalled to the throne by election, but were the mere puppets of the\r\nnobles, whose rivalries and party dissensions plunged the country into\r\ncalamitous wars and almost equally disastrous treaties of peace.\r\nGustavus IV. lacked the ability to cope with the difficulties of the\r\ntimes, and after suffering in turn for his alliance with France,\r\nEngland, and Russia, was forcibly deposed in 1809, and his successor,\r\nCharles XIII., saw himself compelled at once to conclude a humiliating\r\npeace with Russia by a cession of nearly a fourth part of the Swedish\r\nterritories, with 1,500,000 inhabitants; Gen. Bernadotte was elected to\r\nthe rank of crown-prince, and he assumed the reins of the government,\r\nand by his steady support of the allies against the French emperor,\r\nsecured to Sweden, at the congress of Vienna, the possession of Norway,\r\nwhen that country was separated from Denmark. Under the able\r\nadministration of Bernadotte, who, in 1818, succeeded to the throne as\r\nCharles XIV., the united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway made great\r\nadvances in material prosperity and political and intellectual\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n=Sweep.= To clear or brush away; as, the cannon swept everything before\r\nit.\r\n\r\n=Swell of the Muzzle.= In gunnery, is the largest part of the gun in\r\nfront of the neck. See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF, MOLDING.\r\n\r\n=Swiss Guards.= See GARDES SUISSES.\r\n\r\n=Switzerland.= A federal republic in Central Europe; bounded on the\r\nnorth by Baden, northeast by Würtemberg and Bavaria, east by the\r\nprincipality of Liechtenstein and the Tyrol, south by Piedmont and\r\nSavoy, and west and northwest by France. Switzerland was in Roman times\r\ninhabited by two races,--the Helvetii on the northwest, and the Rhætians\r\non the southeast. When the invasions took place, the Burgundians settled\r\nin Western Switzerland, while the Alemanni took possession of the\r\ncountry east of the Aar. The Goths entered the country from Italy, and\r\ntook possession of the country of the Rhætians. Switzerland in the early\r\npart of the Middle Ages formed part of the German empire, and feudalism\r\nsprang up in the Swiss highlands even more vigorously than elsewhere.\r\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries, the greater part of Switzerland was\r\nruled on behalf of the emperors by the lords of Zahringen, who did much\r\nto check civil wars. They, however, became extinct in 1218, and then the\r\ncountry was distracted by wars, which broke out among the leading\r\nfamilies. The great towns united in self-defense, and many of them\r\nobtained imperial charters. Rudolph of Habsburg, who became emperor in\r\n1273, favored the independence of the towns; but his son Albert I. took\r\nanother course. He attacked the great towns, and was defeated. The\r\nleading men of the Forest Cantons met on the Rütli meadow, on November\r\n7, 1307, and resolved to expel the Austrian bailiffs or landvögte. A war\r\nensued which terminated in favor of the Swiss at Morgarten (which see)\r\nin 1315. Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden, with Lucerne, Zürich, Glarus,\r\nZug, and Bern, eight cantons in all, in 1352, entered into a perpetual\r\nleague, which was the foundation of the Swiss Confederation. Other wars\r\nwith Austria followed, which terminated favorably for the confederates\r\nat Nafels (which see) and Sempach (which see). In 1415, the people of\r\nthe cantons became the aggressors. They invaded Aargau and Thurgau,\r\nparts of the Austrian territory, and annexed them; three years later,\r\nthey crossed the Alps, and annexed Ticino, and constituted all three\r\nsubject states. The Swiss were next engaged in a struggle on the French\r\nfrontier with Charles the Bold of Burgundy. They entered the field with\r\n34,000 men, to oppose an army of 60,000, and yet they were successful,\r\ngaining the famous battles of Granson and Morat (see MORAT) in 1476. In\r\n1499, the emperor Maximilian I. made a final attempt to bring\r\nSwitzerland once more within the bounds of the empire. He sought to draw\r\nmen and supplies from the inhabitants for his Turkish war, but in vain.\r\nHe was defeated in six desperate engagements. Basel and Schaffhausen\r\n(1501), and Appenzell (1513), were then received into the confederation,\r\nand its true independence began. New troubles sprang up with the\r\nReformation. War broke out in 1531 between the Catholics and\r\nProtestants, and the former were successful at Cappel (which see), where\r\nZwingli was slain. This victory to some extent settled the boundaries of\r\nthe two creeds; in 1536, however, Bern wrested the Pays de Vaud from the\r\ndukes of Savoy. During the Thirty Years’ War, Bern and Zürich contrived\r\nto maintain with great skill the neutrality of Switzerland, and in the\r\ntreaty of Westphalia, in 1648, it was acknowledged by the great powers\r\nas a separate and independent state. At this period, the Swiss, in\r\nimmense numbers, were employed as soldiers in foreign service, and the\r\nrecord of their exploits gives ample evidence of their courage and\r\nhardihood. In 1798, Switzerland was seized by the French. At the peace\r\nof 1815, its independence was again acknowledged. In 1839, at Zürich, a\r\nmob of peasants, headed by the Protestant clergy, overturned the\r\ngovernment. In Valais, where universal suffrage had put power into the\r\nhands of the reactionary party, a war took place in which the latter\r\nwere victorious. In 1844, a proposal was made in the Diet to expel the\r\nJesuits; but that body declined to act. The radical party then organized\r\nbodies of armed men, called the Free Corps, which invaded the Catholic\r\ncantons; but they were defeated. The Catholic cantons then formed a\r\nleague, named the Sonderbund, for defense against the Free Corps. A\r\nmajority in the Diet, in 1847, declared the illegality of the\r\nSonderbund, and decreed the expulsion of the Jesuits. In the war which\r\nensued between the federal army and the forces of the Sonderbund, the\r\nformer were victorious at Freiburg and Lucerne. The leagued cantons were\r\nmade liable in all the expenses of the war, the Jesuits were expelled,\r\nand the monasteries were suppressed. Since then, the most important\r\nevent which has occurred was a rebellion against the king of Prussia, as\r\nprince of Neufchâtel. The canton was declared a republic, with a\r\nconstitution similar to that of the other Swiss states.\r\n\r\n=Swivel.= A small piece of ordnance, turning on a point or swivel.\r\n\r\n=Sword.= A well-known weapon of war, the introduction of which dates\r\nbeyond the ken of history. It may be defined as a blade of steel, having\r\none or two edges, set in a hilt, and used with a motion of the whole\r\narm. Damascus and Toledo blades have been brought to such perfection,\r\nthat the point can be made to touch the hilt and to fly back to its\r\nformer position. In the last century every gentleman wore a sword; now\r\nthe use of the weapon is almost confined to purposes of war. Among the\r\nforms of the sword are the rapier, cutlass, broadsword, scimiter, sabre,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Sword Law.= When a thing is enforced, without a due regard being paid\r\nto established rules and regulations, it is said to be carried by sword\r\nlaw, or by the will of the strongest.\r\n\r\n=Sword, Order of the.= A Swedish military order of knighthood,\r\ninstituted by Gustavus Vasa.\r\n\r\n=Sword-arm.= The right arm.\r\n\r\n=Sword-bayonet.= Short arms, as carbines, are sometimes furnished with a\r\nbayonet made in the form of a sword. The back of the handle has a\r\ngroove, which fits upon a stud upon the barrel, and the cross-piece has\r\na hole which fits the barrel. The bayonet is prevented from slipping off\r\nby a spring-catch. The sword-bayonet is ordinarily carried as a\r\nside-arm, for which purpose it is well adapted, having a curved cutting\r\nedge as well as sharp point.\r\n\r\n=Sword-bearer.= In monarchical countries, is the title given to the\r\npublic officer who bears the sword of state.\r\n\r\n=Sword-bearers, Knights.= A community similar to, though much less\r\ndistinguished than, the Teutonic Knights.\r\n\r\n=Sword-belt.= A belt made of leather, that hung over the right shoulder\r\nof an officer, by which his sword was suspended on the left side. This\r\nbelt is no longer used, as the sword is now suspended from the\r\nwaist-belt.\r\n\r\n=Sword-blade.= The blade or cutting part of a sword.\r\n\r\n=Sword-cane.= A cane containing a sword.\r\n\r\n=Sword-cutler.= One who makes swords.\r\n\r\n=Sworded.= Girded with a sword.\r\n\r\n=Sword-fight.= Fencing; a combat or trial of skill with swords.\r\n\r\n=Sword-knot.= A ribbon tied to the hilt of a sword. In the United\r\nStates, all general officers wear a gold cord with acorn ends, and all\r\nother officers, a gold lace strap, with gold bullion tassel; the\r\nenlisted men of cavalry wear a leathern strap with a bullion tassel of\r\nthe same material.\r\n\r\n=Sword-player.= A fencer; a gladiator; one who exhibits his skill in the\r\nuse of the sword.\r\n\r\n=Swordsman.= A soldier; a fighting man. One skilled in the use of the\r\nsword; a professor of the science of fencing.\r\n\r\n=Swordsmanship.= The state of being a swordsman; skilled in the use of\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\n=Sybaris.= A celebrated Greek town in Lucania, was situated between the\r\nrivers Sybaris and Crathis, and a short distance from the Tarentine\r\nGulf, and near the confines of Bruttium. It was founded by Achæans and\r\nTrœzenians in 720 B.C., and soon attained an extraordinary degree of\r\nprosperity and wealth, exercising dominion over twenty-five towns, and,\r\nit is said, was able to bring 300,000 men into the field. But its\r\nprosperity was of short duration. The Achæans having expelled the\r\nTrœzenian part of the population, the latter took refuge at the\r\nneighboring city of Croton, the inhabitants of which espoused their\r\ncause. In the war which ensued between the two states, the Sybarites\r\nwere completely conquered by the Crotoniats, who followed up their\r\nvictory by the capture of Sybaris, which they destroyed by turning the\r\nwaters of the river Crathis against the town, 510 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Syef= (_Ind._). A long sword.\r\n\r\n=Syef-ul Mulk= (_Ind._). The sword of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n=Sygambri=, =Sugambri=, =Sigambri=, =Sycambri=, or =Sicambri=. One of\r\nthe most powerful tribes of Germany at an early time, belonged to the\r\nIstævones, and dwelt originally north of the Ubii on the Rhine, whence\r\nthey spread toward the north as far as the Lippe. The territory of the\r\nSygambri was invaded by Cæsar. They were conquered by Tiberius in the\r\nreign of Augustus, and a large number of them were transplanted to Gaul,\r\nwhere they received settlements between the Maas and the Rhine as Roman\r\nsubjects. At a later period we find them forming an important part of\r\nthe confederacy known under the name of Franci.\r\n\r\n=Symbol.= In a military sense, a badge. Every regiment in the British\r\nservice has its badge.\r\n\r\n=Syracuse= (It. _Siracusa_). Anciently the most famous and powerful city\r\nof Sicily, situated on the southeast coast of the island, 80 miles\r\nsouth-southwest from Messina; was founded by a body of Corinthian\r\nsettlers under Archias, one of the Bacchiadæ, 734 B.C. In 486 a\r\nrevolution took place and the oligarchic families--_Geomori_, or\r\n_Gamori_, “land-owners”--were expelled, and the sovereign power was\r\ntransferred to the citizens at large. Before a year passed, however,\r\nGelon, “despot” of Gela, had restored the exiles, and at the same time\r\nmade himself master of Syracuse. Hieron, brother of Gelon, raised\r\nSyracuse to an unexampled degree of prosperity. Hieron died in 467, and\r\nwas succeeded by his brother Thrasybulus; but the rapacity and cruelty\r\nof the latter soon provoked a revolt among his subjects, which led to\r\nhis deposition and the establishment of a democratical form of\r\ngovernment. The next most important event in the history of Syracuse was\r\nthe siege of the city by the Athenians, which ended in the total\r\ndestruction of the great Athenian armament in 413; and Syracuse’s renown\r\nat once spread over the whole Greek world. Dionysius restored the\r\n“tyranny” of Gelon, and his fierce and victorious war with Carthage (397\r\nB.C.) raised the renown of Syracuse still higher. On the death of Hieron\r\nII., his grandson Hieronymus, who succeeded him, espoused the side of\r\nthe Carthaginians. A Roman army under Marcellus was sent against\r\nSyracuse, and after a siege of two years, during which Archimedes\r\nassisted his fellow-citizens by the construction of various engines of\r\nwar, the city was taken by Marcellus in 212. Under the Romans, Syracuse\r\nslowly but surely declined. Captured, pillaged, and burned by the\r\nSaracens (878) it sunk into complete decay, so that very few traces of\r\nits ancient grandeur are now to be seen. It was taken by Count Roger,\r\nthe Norman, 1088; in the insurrection, Syracuse surrendered to the\r\nNeapolitan troops, April 8, 1849.\r\n\r\n=Syria.= At present, forming together with Palestine, a division of\r\nAsiatic Turkey; extends between lat. 31° and 37° 20′ N. along the\r\nMediterranean from the Gulf of Iskanderoon to the Isthmus of Suez. The\r\noldest inhabitants of Syria were all of Shemitic descent; the\r\nCanaanites, like the Jews themselves, and the Phœnicians (who inhabited\r\nthe coast-regions) were Shemites. So were also the Aramæans, who\r\noccupied Damascus and extended eastward towards the Euphrates. This\r\nterritory, Syria proper, became subject to the Hebrew monarchy in the\r\ntime of David; but after Solomon’s death Rezin made himself independent\r\nin Damascus, and while the Jewish empire was divided into two kingdoms,\r\nthe Aramæan kings of Damascus conquered and incorporated the whole\r\nnorthern and central part of the country. In 740 B.C. the Assyrian king,\r\nTiglath-Pileser, conquered Damascus, and in 720 B.C. the kingdom of\r\nIsrael. In 587 B.C. the kingdom of Judah was conquered by\r\nNebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and Syria, with Palestine, was now\r\nsuccessively handed over from the Assyrians to the Babylonians, from the\r\nBabylonians to the Medes, and from the Medes to the Persians. After the\r\nbattle of the Issus (333 B.C.) Alexander the Great conquered the\r\ncountry, and with him came the Greeks. After his death they formed here\r\na flourishing empire under the Seleucidæ, who reigned from 312 to 64\r\nB.C. After the victories over Antigonus at Ipsus in 301 B.C., and over\r\nLysimachus at Cyropedion in 282 B.C., the empire of Seleucus I. actually\r\ncomprised the whole empire of Alexander with the exception of Egypt. But\r\nhis son, Antiochus I., Soter (281-260), lost Pergamum, and failed in his\r\nattempts against the Gauls who invaded Asia Minor, and Antiochus II.,\r\nTheos (260-247), lost Parthia and Bactria. Antiochus the Great (223-187)\r\nconquered Palestine, which by the division of Alexander’s empire had\r\nfallen to the Ptolemies of Egypt; but under Antiochus Epiphanes\r\n(174-164) the Jews revolted, and after a contest of twenty-five years\r\nthey made themselves independent. Under Antiochus XIII. (69-64) Pompey\r\nconquered the country and made it a Roman province, governed by a Roman\r\nproconsul. After the conquest of Jerusalem (70) Palestine was added to\r\nthis province. By the division of the Roman empire Syria fell to the\r\nEastern or Byzantine part. In 638 the country was conquered by the\r\nSaracens. In 654 Damascus was made the capital of Syria, and in 661 of\r\nthe whole Mohammedan empire. When the Abbassides removed their residence\r\nto Bagdad, Syria sank into a mere province. In the 11th century the\r\nSeljuk Turks conquered the country. The establishment of the Latin\r\nkingdom by the Crusaders in 1099 was of short duration and of little\r\nadvantage. They held Jerusalem till 1187, Acre till 1291, but they\r\nproved more rapacious and more cruel than the Turks. When in 1291 the\r\nMameluke rulers of Egypt finally drove the Christian knights out of the\r\ncountry, its cities were in ruins, its fields devastated, and its\r\npopulation degraded. Still worse things were in waiting,--the invasion\r\nof Tamerlane and his successors, which actually transformed large\r\nregions into deserts and the inhabitants into savages. In 1517, Sultan\r\nSelim I. conquered the country, and since that time it has formed part\r\nof the Turkish empire, with the exception of the short period from 1832\r\nto 1841, when Ibrahim Pasha (who defeated the army of the grand seignior\r\nat Konieh, December 21, 1832) governed it under the authority of his\r\nfather, Mehemet Ali (who had captured Acre, and overrun the whole of\r\nSyria). The Druses are said to have destroyed 151 Christian villages and\r\nkilled 1000 persons, May 29 to July 1, 1860. The Mahommedans massacred\r\nChristians at Damascus; about 3300 were slain, but many were saved by\r\nAbd-el-Kader, July, 1860; the French and English governments intervened;\r\n4000 French soldiers under Gen. Hautpoul landed at Beyrout, August 22,\r\n1860. The French and Turks advanced against Lebanon, and fourteen emirs\r\nsurrendered, October, 1860. The pacification of the country was\r\neffected, November, 1860; and the French occupation ceased June 5, 1861.\r\nThe insurrection of Joseph Karaman, a Maronite, in Lebanon, was\r\nsuppressed, March, 1866; another was suppressed, and Karaman fled to\r\nAlgeria, January 31, 1867.\r\n\r\n=System.= In fortification, is a particular arrangement and mode of\r\nconstructing the different works surrounding a fortified place. The\r\nprincipal systems now studied are those of Marshal Vauban, and the\r\nimproved method invented by Cormontaigne, the celebrated French\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n=System.= A scheme which reduces many things to regular dependence or\r\nco-operation. This word is frequently applied to some particular mode of\r\ndrilling and exercising men to fit them for manœuvres and evolutions.\r\nHence, the Prussian system, the Austrian system, etc.\r\n\r\n=System, Military.= Specific rules and regulations for the government of\r\nan army in the field or in quarters, etc.\r\n\r\n=Systems of Artillery.= The character and arrangement of the material of\r\nartillery, as adopted by a nation at any particular epoch. The American\r\nsystems of field and siege artillery are chiefly derived from those of\r\nFrance. The principal qualities sought to be observed in establishing a\r\nsystem of artillery are, simplicity, mobility, and power. The first\r\nsystem adopted in France was about the middle of the 16th century, at\r\nwhich time the various guns of the French artillery were reduced to six.\r\nThe weights of the balls corresponding to these calibers ranging from\r\n33¹⁄₄ to ³⁄₄ pounds. This range of calibers was thought to be necessary,\r\nfor the reason that it required guns of large caliber to destroy\r\nresisting objects, while guns of small caliber were necessary to keep up\r\nwith the movement of troops. Each of the five principal calibers was\r\nmounted on a different carriage, and the ammunition, stores, and tools\r\nwere carried on different store-carts. Three kinds of powder were used,\r\nviz.: large-grain, small-grain, and priming, which were carried in\r\nbarrels of three sizes. The axle-trees, which were of wood, varied for\r\nthe different wheels, as well as for the different guns. The\r\ngun-carriages were without limbers, and had only two wheels, the shafts\r\nbeing attached to the trails, which often dragged along the ground. No\r\nspare wheels were used, except for pieces of large caliber; and for\r\nfacility of transportation these were put on an axle-tree, so as to form\r\na carriage. With the exception of replacing injured wheels, all repairs\r\nwere made on the spot, from the resources of the country, and no spare\r\narticles were carried with the train. There was no established charge of\r\npowder for the guns; although a weight equal to that of the shot was\r\ngenerally used. Such was the character of the artillery which\r\naccompanied the French armies up to the middle of the 17th century. In\r\nthe reign of Louis XIV., the calibers of cannon were gradually changed\r\nby the introduction of several foreign pieces. There were 48-, 32-, 24-,\r\n16-, 12-, 8-, and 4-pounders; and those of the same caliber varied in\r\nweight, length, and shape. Uniformity existed in general in each\r\ndistrict commanded by a lieutenant-general of artillery, but the cannon\r\nof one district differed from another. Each district had (for the six\r\nkinds of cannon) six carriages, with different wheels, and three kinds\r\nof limbers, with different wheels, making nine patterns of wheels,\r\nwithout counting those for the platform-wagons used to transport heavy\r\nguns, the ammunition-carts, the trucks, and the wagons for small stores\r\nand tools. Spare carriages were carried into the field, but those of one\r\ndistrict would not fit the guns of another. There was but one kind of\r\npowder, and this was carried in barrels. The charge was usually\r\ntwo-thirds the weight of the projectile, roughly measured. Besides this,\r\nthe powder often varied in strength according to the district from which\r\nit came.\r\n\r\n_Valière’s System._--In 1735, Gen. Valière abolished the 32-pounder, as\r\nbeing heavy and useless, and gave uniformity to the five remaining\r\ncalibers. Towards the end of the 18th century, mortars, or Dutch\r\nhowitzers, were sometimes attached to the field-trains; for the latter,\r\na small charge, and caliber of 8 inches, were adopted. There were also\r\nlight 4-pounder guns attached to each regiment. Up to that time an army\r\nalways carried with it heavy guns (24-pounders), and light guns\r\n(4-pounders), which were combined in the same park. Valière established\r\na system of uniformity for cannon throughout France; but such was not\r\nthe case with the carriages and wagons used with them. Great exactness\r\nwas not then sought for, and there existed as many plans for\r\nconstructing gun-carriages as there were arsenals of construction. The\r\naxle-trees were of wood, the limbers were very low, and the horses were\r\nattached in single file.\r\n\r\n_Gribeauval’s System._--In 1765, Gen. Gribeauval founded a new system,\r\nby separating the field from the siege artillery. He diminished the\r\ncharge of field-guns from a half to a third the weight of the shot, but\r\nas he diminished the windage of the projectile at the same time, he was\r\nenabled to shorten them and render them lighter, without sensibly\r\ndiminishing their range. Field artillery then consisted of 12-, 8-, and\r\n4-pounder guns, to which was added a 6-inch howitzer, still retaining a\r\nsmall charge, but larger in proportion to that before used. For draught,\r\nthe horses were disposed in double files, which was much more favorable\r\nto rapid gaits. Iron axle-trees, higher limbers, and traveling\r\ntrunnion-holes rendered the draught easier. The adoption of cartridges,\r\nelevating screws, and tangent scales, increased the rapidity and\r\nregularity of the fire. Stronger carriages were made for the lighter\r\nguns, and the different parts of all were made with more care, and\r\nstrengthened with ironwork. Uniformity was established in all the new\r\nconstructions, by compelling all the arsenals to make every part of the\r\ncarriages, wagons, and limbers according to certain fixed dimensions. By\r\nthis exact correspondence of all the parts of a carriage, spare parts\r\ncould be carried into the field ready made, to refit. Thus an equipment\r\nwas obtained which could be easily repaired, and could be moved with a\r\nfacility hitherto unknown. In order to reduce the number of spare\r\narticles necessary for repairs, Gribeauval gave, as far as practicable,\r\nthe same dimensions to those things which were of the same nature. The\r\nexcellence of this system was tested in the wars of the French republic\r\nand empire, in which it played an important part. In 1827, the system of\r\nGribeauval was changed by introducing the 24- and 32-pounder howitzers,\r\nlengthened to correspond with the 8- and 12-pounder guns, and abolishing\r\nthe 4-pounder gun and 6-inch howitzer. Afterwards some important\r\nimprovements were made in the carriages, chiefly copied from the English\r\nsystem; the number for all field-cannon was reduced to two, the wheels\r\nof the carriage and limber were made of the same size; the weight of\r\nthe limber was reduced, and an ammunition-chest placed on it; the method\r\nof connecting the carriage and limber was simplified, and the operations\r\nof limbering and unlimbering greatly facilitated; and the two flasks\r\nwhich formed the trail were replaced by a single piece called the\r\n_stock_, which arrangement allowed the new pieces to turn in a smaller\r\nspace than that required by the old ones.\r\n\r\n_Louis Napoleon’s System._--In 1850, Louis Napoleon, emperor of the\r\nFrench, caused a series of experiments to be made at the principal\r\nartillery schools of France to test the merits of a new system of field\r\nartillery proposed by himself. The principal idea involved in this\r\nsystem was, to substitute a single gun of medium weight and caliber,\r\ncapable of firing shot and shells, for the 8- and 12-pounder guns, and\r\n24- and 32-pounder howitzers, then in use. The caliber selected was the\r\n12-pounder. The favorable results of all these experiments, and the\r\nsimplicity of the system, led to the adoption of this, the Napoleon gun,\r\nas it is sometimes called, into the French service; and others of\r\nsimilar principle were introduced into various European services, and\r\nalso into our own. As this piece unites the properties of gun and\r\nhowitzer, it is called _canon-obusier_, or gun-howitzer.\r\n\r\nAt no time since the discovery of gunpowder have such important\r\nimprovements been made in fire-arms as within the past few years. These\r\nimprovements may be summed up as follows, viz.: (1) Improvement in the\r\nquality of cast iron, and the consequent increase in the caliber of\r\nsea-coast cannon. In 1820, the heaviest gun mounted in the United States\r\non sea-coast batteries was the 24-pounder; at present the heaviest is a\r\n20-inch gun, carrying a shell weighing 1080 pounds. (2) The use of\r\nwrought and chilled iron and steel as a material for fortress carriages,\r\nand for covering ships of war. (3) The extensive introduction of shells\r\nin sea-coast defenses and naval warfare; and spherical case-shot into\r\nthe field service. (4) The introduction of rifling for both small-arms\r\nand cannon. (5) The successful application of the breech-loading\r\nprinciple to cannon and small-arms of every description, and the great\r\nimprovement made of late in steel, as well as the power to manipulate\r\nmasses sufficiently large for the construction of the immense cannon now\r\nemployed in naval warfare and for sea-coast defense.\r\n\r\n=Szegedin.= The second largest town in Hungary, situated on the right\r\nbank of the Theiss. Szegedin is fortified, and here, on August 3, 1849,\r\nthe Austrians defeated the Hungarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tab.= The arming of an archer’s gauntlet or glove.\r\n\r\n=Tabard.= A military garment in general use in the latter half of the\r\n15th, and beginning of the 16th century, which succeeded the _jupon_ and\r\n_cyclas_. It fitted closely to the body, was open at the sides, had wide\r\nsleeves or flaps reaching to the elbow, and displayed the armorial\r\nensigns of the wearer on the back and front, as well as on the sleeves.\r\nAbout the middle of the 16th century the tabard ceased to be used except\r\nby the officers-of-arms, who have down to the present time continued to\r\nwear tabards embroidered with the arms of the sovereign.\r\n\r\n=Table-money.= In the British army and navy, is an allowance sometimes\r\nmade to officers over and above their pay, for table expenses.\r\n\r\n=Tablette.= Is a flat coping-stone, generally 2 feet wide and 8 inches\r\nthick, placed at the top of the revetment of the escarp, for the purpose\r\nof protecting the masonry from the effects of the weather, and also to\r\nserve as an obstacle to the besiegers when applying the scaling-ladders.\r\nIt is always considered a matter of importance that the tablette should\r\nbe concealed from the enemy’s view, as he would otherwise be able to\r\ndirect his artillery against it; therefore, the escarp of all the works\r\ninclosed within the covered way is submitted at least 6 inches to the\r\ncrest of the glacis.\r\n\r\n=Tabor.= A fortified town of Bohemia, 48 miles south-southeast of\r\nPrague. Its castle was originally built in 774, destroyed in 1268, but\r\nrestored in 1420, when the Hussites under Ziska took possession of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n=Taborite.= A Roman soldier armed with a double-edged axe.\r\n\r\n=Tabors= (_Fr._). Intrenchment of baggage for defense against cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Tabour.= A small drum, played with one stick, in combination with a\r\nfife. It was formerly used in war, but has now given place to the\r\nkettle-drum.\r\n\r\n=Tabriz=, or =Tabreez= (written also _Tauris_ and _Tebriz_). A city of\r\nNorth Persia, capital of the province of Azerbaijan. It was taken and\r\nsacked by Timur in 1392, and was soon after seized by the Turkomans,\r\nfrom whom it was taken by the Persians in 1500. It has been several\r\ntimes in the hands of the Turks, but was finally taken from them by\r\nNadir Shah in 1730.\r\n\r\n=Tactician.= One versed in tactics.\r\n\r\n=Tactics, Grand.= See TACTICS, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Tactics, Military.= Is the science and art of disposing military\r\nforces in order for battle, and performing military evolutions in the\r\npresence of an enemy. It is divided into _grand tactics_, or the tactics\r\nof battle, and _elementary tactics_, or the tactics of instruction.\r\nTactics is the strategy of the battle-field; the science of manœuvring\r\nand combining those military units which drill, discipline, and the\r\nregimental system have brought to the perfection of machines. It was\r\nadmirably described by Napoleon as _the art of being the\r\nstronger_,--that is, of bringing an overwhelming force to bear on any\r\ngiven point, whatever may be the relative strength of the entire armies\r\nopposed. The earliest records of battles are those of mere single\r\ncombats, in which the chiefs, fighting either on foot or in chariots,\r\nperformed great deeds; and the commonalty, who apparently were without\r\ndiscipline, were held in profound contempt. With the growth of democracy\r\narose the organization of the _phalanx_ (which see), the advance of\r\nwhich was irresistible, and its firmness equally so, if charged in\r\nfront. It, however, changed front with great difficulty; was much\r\nderanged by broken ground, and failed entirely in pursuit, or if\r\nattacked in flank. Far lighter and more mobile was the Roman _legion_.\r\n(See LEGION.) Among Roman tactics was also the admirable intrenchment,\r\nwhich they scarcely ever omitted as an additional source of strength for\r\ntheir position. “Events reproduce themselves in cycles;” and with the\r\ndecay of Roman civilization came again the mail-clad heroes and\r\ncavaliers--mounted this time on horses--who monopolized the honors of\r\nbattle, while the undisciplined footmen had an undue share of the\r\ndangers. Later in the feudal period, this disparity between knight and\r\nfootman was diminished by the employment of bodies of archers, whose\r\nshafts carried instant death. The adoption of gunpowder for small-arms\r\naltogether neutralized the superiority of the armored knight. This\r\nchange brought infantry into the front place in battle, and threw\r\ncavalry into the status of an auxiliary. The French revolutionary wars\r\ntended much to the development of artillery as a field-weapon, and\r\nNapoleon employed this terrible weapon to its fullest extent, a practice\r\nfollowed by the best modern generals, who never risk a man where a\r\ncannon-ball can do the work. Frederick the Great was considered an\r\ninnovator for fighting with infantry four deep. During the French war,\r\nthe formation of three deep became general, and still obtains in several\r\nEuropean armies. Before the battle of Waterloo, the British leaders had\r\nacquired sufficient confidence in their troops to marshal them in a\r\ndouble line. It is doubtful whether the advance in arms of precision\r\nwill not soon necessitate the formation in a single line, or even in a\r\nsingle line in open order. We will now notice briefly a few of the more\r\nimportant principles, as our space will not permit us to go into that\r\nintricate science, modern tactics. As to _the art of being stronger_,\r\nwhich is undoubtedly the highest recommendation in a general, we may\r\ncite the example of the battle of Rivoli. In 1796, Napoleon was\r\nbesieging Mantua with a small force, while a very much smaller army of\r\nobservation watched the Austrians. The Austrian commander had collected\r\nat Trent a force powerful enough to crush completely the French army,\r\nwith which he was marching south. Parallel with his course lay the Lake\r\nof Garda, and to prevent the enemy escaping up one side as he marched\r\ndown the other, the Austrian leader divided his army into two powerful\r\ncorps, and marched one down each side of the lake. The instant the young\r\nFrench general knew of this division he abandoned the siege of Mantua,\r\ncollected every available man, and marched against one body of the\r\nenemy. Though far inferior on the whole, he was thus superior at the\r\npoint of attack, and the victory of Rivoli decided virtually the whole\r\ncampaign. This corresponded in principle with Napoleon’s general plan in\r\nbattle. He formed his attack into column, tried to break through the\r\ncentre of the enemy’s line; and if he succeeded, then doubled back to\r\none side, so as to concentrate the whole of his own force against\r\none-half of the enemy’s, which was usually routed before the other half\r\nof the line could come up to the rescue.\r\n\r\nTaken collectively, the tactics of the three arms may thus be\r\nsummarized: The infantry form the line of battle, and probably decide\r\nthe day by a general advance over the enemy’s ground. The cavalry seek\r\nto break the opposing infantry by frequent charges in front, or on any\r\nflank which may be left exposed. If a part of the line wavers, a charge\r\nof horse should complete the disarray. When the rout commences, the\r\ncavalry should turn it by furious onslaught into utter discomfiture. The\r\nprovince of the artillery is to cannonade any portion of the line where\r\nmen are massed, or where a charge is about to be made; to demoralize\r\ncavalry, and generally to carry destruction wherever it can best\r\ndisconcert the enemy. Adverting now very briefly to the tactics of the\r\nseveral arms individually, we have--\r\n\r\n_Infantry._--This force has four formations,--skirmishers, line, column,\r\nand square. The skirmishers precede and flank an advancing line or\r\ncolumn, picking off the enemy, whose masses offer good mark, while their\r\nown extended order gives them comparative impunity. If resistance be\r\nencountered in force, the skirmishers retreat behind their massed\r\nsupports. The line is a double or treble line of men, firing or\r\ncharging. For musketry purposes, it is the most formidable formation,\r\nand is the favorite English tactic in every case where the officers can\r\ndepend on the steadiness of their men. For bursting through a line, the\r\ndeep column is the most effective. It is the favorite French formation,\r\nand during the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, the British and\r\nRussians alone succeeded in resisting it. The column is the best\r\nformation on a march; and the line, when in actual collision with the\r\nenemy. The formation in _echelon_ to a great extent combines these\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\n_Cavalry._--The function of heavy cavalry is limited to the charge in\r\nline. The light cavalry form in small sections, to scour the country,\r\ncollect supplies, and cut off stragglers.\r\n\r\n_Artillery._--No distinct tactics exist for this arm beyond the fact\r\nthat a concentrated fire is vastly the most effective, and that the\r\nartillery should always have a support of infantry at hand, to protect\r\nit from a sudden incursion of hostile cavalry.\r\n\r\n_Tactics of position_ depend on the moral energy of the\r\ncommander-in-chief. Few would dare, as Cæsar did, an invasion in which\r\nthere was no retreat if defeated. It is a military maxim not to fight\r\nwith the rear on a river, unless many bridges be provided for retreat,\r\nin case of disaster. A convex front is better than a concave front,\r\nbecause internal communication is more easy. The flank should be\r\nprotected by cavalry, or preferably by natural obstacles. In battle, a\r\nlong march from one position to another, which exposes the flank to the\r\nenemy, is a fatal error. By such, the French won Austerlitz, and lost\r\nTalavera. In a pursuit, a parallel line is better than the immediate\r\nroute the retreating enemy has taken, as supplies will be more readily\r\nprocured, and he may by celerity be attacked in flank. This was\r\nstrikingly exemplified in the Russian pursuit of Napoleon’s army\r\nretreating from Moscow.\r\n\r\n=Tae-pings=, or =Tai-pings=. The name given to the Chinese rebels who\r\nmade their appearance in 1850, and desolated some of the best provinces\r\nof China. Peking was taken by the English and French on October 12,\r\n1860. Its capture was followed by the ratification of the treaty of\r\nTien-tsin, which, granting important privileges to European merchants,\r\nmade it the direct interest of the English, French, and American\r\ngovernments to re-establish order in China. The repulse of the rebels at\r\nShanghai in August, 1860, had been followed by several engagements\r\nbetween them and the imperialists, in which they were defeated. Ward, an\r\nAmerican, who had taken service under the emperor, and who showed a\r\nremarkable talent for organizing irregular troops, had wrought a\r\nwonderful improvement in the imperialist army, and he was the chief\r\nmeans of their success. In the beginning of 1862, the Tae-pings again\r\nadvanced on Shanghai, and were twice defeated. In the autumn of the same\r\nyear, Ward was killed; Ward’s force was handed over to an English\r\nofficer, and took the name of Gordon’s brigade. Gordon’s brigade\r\nrendered essential service to the imperial government. The rebels were\r\ndefeated in upwards of sixteen engagements; and in 1864, almost every\r\nimportant city was taken from them. The conduct of the imperial\r\nauthorities at Su-chow, where a horrible massacre took place, led to the\r\nwithdrawal of the English military force; but the rebellion had been\r\neffectually checked. Toward the end of 1864, the Tae-pings, however,\r\nstill offered an opposition to the imperialists in Kiang-tsu, all the\r\nmore formidable in consequence of the prevalence of brigandage and\r\ninsurrectionary movements in parts of the empire not affected by the\r\nTae-ping rebellion. In January, 1865, the Mohammedan Tartars of\r\nSongaria, on the Siberian frontier, assisted by the free Kirghis tribes,\r\ntook the town of Tarbagatai, and afterwards Kouldja. In the following\r\nJune, a still more serious insurrection broke out in China proper, that\r\nof the Nien-fei, or rebels of the north, whose special object was to\r\noverturn the reigning dynasty. One body of them, in the beginning of\r\n1866, caused serious alarm in Hankow, and would have attacked the\r\nEuropean settlement but for the arrival of some English gunboats. It is\r\nbelieved that the last embers of the Tae-ping rebellion were trodden out\r\nin February, 1866, when from 30,000 to 50,000 rebels were routed by the\r\nimperial army at Kia-ying-chou in Kwan-tung. The victorious general then\r\nset out to attack the Nien-fei, or northern rebels, at Hankow, and the\r\nimperial troops were several times defeated by them in 1867; but late in\r\n1868, their operations became unimportant.\r\n\r\n=Taganrog.= A town of Russia in Europe, in the government of\r\nEkaterinoslav, near the northwest extremity of the Sea of Azov, 172\r\nmiles northeast from Kertch.

Tangier was taken by the Portuguese in 1471, and ceded to\r\nthe English in 1662, and held by them for twenty-two years. It was\r\nbombarded by the French in 1844.\r\n\r\n=Tanjore.= A town of British India, capital of a district of the same\r\nname, in the presidency of Madras.

They also\r\nextended into Margiana, and probably farther north on the eastern side\r\nof the Caspian, where their original abodes seem to have been in the\r\nmountains called by their name.\r\n\r\n=Tara.= A hill in Meath, Ireland, where it is said a conference was held\r\nbetween the English and Irish in 1173. Near here, on May 26, 1798, the\r\nroyalist troops, 400 in number, defeated the insurgent Irish 4000\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n=Taranto= (anc. _Tarentum_). A town of Southern Italy, province of Terra\r\nd’Otranto, is situated on a rocky islet formerly an isthmus between the\r\nMare Piccolo (Little Sea), and the Mare Grande (Great Sea), or Gulf of\r\nTaranto, on the west. Ancient Tarentum was a far more splendid city than\r\nits modern representative. Its greatness dates from 708 B.C., when the\r\noriginal inhabitants were expelled, and the town was taken possession of\r\nby a strong body of Lacedæmonian Partheniæ under the guidance of\r\nPhalanthus. It soon became the most powerful city in the whole of Magna\r\nGræcia, and exercised a kind of supremacy over the other Greek cities in\r\nItaly. It possessed a considerable fleet of ships of war, and was able\r\nto bring into the field, with the assistance of its allies, an army of\r\n30,000 foot and 3000 horse. The people of Tarentum, assisted by Pyrrhus,\r\nking of Epirus, supported a war which had been undertaken in 281 B.C. by\r\nthe Romans, to avenge the insults the Tarentines had offered to their\r\nships when near their harbors; it was terminated after ten years;\r\n300,000 prisoners were taken, and Tarentum became subject to Rome.\r\nExcept the citadel, Tarentum was captured by the Carthaginians, 212, but\r\nrecovered by Fabius, 209 B.C. Tarentum has shared in the revolutions of\r\nSouthern Italy.\r\n\r\n=Tarazona.= A town of Spain, in the province of Zaragoza, on the\r\nQueyles, a tributary of the Ebro. It is the ancient _Turiaso_, and here\r\na few Roman troops routed a Celtiberian army. It became a _municipium_\r\nunder the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Tarbes.= A town of France, in the department of Hautes Pyrenees, on the\r\nleft bank of the Adour. For a long time it belonged to the English\r\nmonarchs, and it was the residence of the Black Prince. On March 20,\r\n1814, a combat took place here between the British under Wellington and\r\nthe French under Soult, in which the former gained the victory.\r\n\r\n=Tar-bucket.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Tard-venus=, or =Malandrins= (_Fr._). Freebooters, banditti, who\r\nelected their own chief, and appeared first in France in 1360.\r\n\r\n=Tarentum.= See TARANTO.\r\n\r\n=Target.= In its modern sense, is the mark for aiming at in practicing\r\nwith the cannon, rifle, or bow and arrow. In its more ancient meaning, a\r\ntarget, or _targe_, was a shield, circular in form, cut out of ox-hide,\r\nmounted on light but strong wood, and strengthened by bosses, spikes,\r\netc. Of modern targets, the simplest is that used for archery. With\r\nregard to rifle-targets, the numerous rifle-matches have caused ranges\r\nto be constructed over the whole country. The necessities are: a butt,\r\nartificially constructed or cut in the face of a hill, to prevent wide\r\nballs from scattering; a marker’s shot-proof cell, near the targets; and\r\na range of such length as can be procured. The targets used at the\r\nCreedmoor range on Long Island, and by the U. S. army, are divided into\r\nthree classes and are of the following sizes: The _third class_, to be\r\nused at all distances up to and including 300 yards, is a rectangle 6\r\nfeet high and 4 feet wide. Three concentric circles are described, with\r\nthe middle point as a centre and radii of 4, 13, and 23 inches\r\nrespectively. The inner circle is black, and so are the lines marking\r\nthe circumference of the middle and outer circles; the rest of the\r\ntarget is white. The _second class_ is a square, 6 feet high. Three\r\nconcentric circles are drawn, with the middle point as a centre and\r\nradii of 11, 19, and 27 inches respectively. The inner circle is black,\r\nas well as the circumferences of the other circles; the rest of the\r\ntarget is white. This target is used at all distances over 300, to, and\r\nincluding, 600 yards. The _first class_, to be used at all distances\r\nover 600 yards, is a rectangle, 6 feet high and 12 feet wide. It has two\r\nconcentric circles, described with a radii of 18 and 27 inches\r\nrespectively, the centre being at the middle point of the target, and\r\ntwo lines drawn parallel to, and 3 feet from, each end (leaving the\r\n_inner_, square, 6 feet by 6 feet). The target is white, except the\r\nlines just indicated and the inner circle, which are black. The smallest\r\ncircle, always painted black, is called the _bull’s-eye_, and when\r\nstruck, counts 5 for the marksman; the ring embraced between the\r\nbull’s-eye and the circumference of the next larger circle is called the\r\n_centre_, which counts 4; and the ring between the second and third\r\ncircles is called the _inner_, which scores 3; and the space outside of\r\nthe larger circle is called the _outer_, and scores 2. In the\r\nfirst-class target the space between the second circle and the vertical\r\nlines is the _inner_, and the space outside the vertical lines is the\r\n_outer_.\r\n\r\nIn artillery practice, targets of considerable size are used at long\r\nranges. The usual practice is over the sea; targets are then painted on\r\nthe sides of old vessels, or are floated by buoys. For trying the power\r\nof ordnance, solid targets are constructed to resemble the sides of\r\niron-plated ships, portions of fortification, etc.\r\n\r\n=Targeted.= Furnished or armed with a target.\r\n\r\n=Targeteer=, or =Targetier=. One armed with a target or shield.\r\n\r\n=Tariere= (_Fr._). A machine of war similar to the battering-ram (which\r\nit preceded), excepting that the head was pointed. It made the first\r\nopening in the wall, which was increased by the _belier_.\r\n\r\n=Tarifa.= A seaport town of Spain, 20 miles southwest from Gibraltar. It\r\nwas successfully defended in 1811 by Col. Gough, with a body of 2500\r\nBritish and Spanish troops against a French force of 10,000 men, under\r\nVictor and Laval.\r\n\r\n=Tarquinii.= An ancient city of Etruria, on the left bank of the Marta,\r\nabout 4 miles from the Mediterranean. In 398 B.C., while the Romans were\r\nat war with the Veii, they were attacked by the Tarquinians, who seem\r\nfrom this time to have been frequently united with the other Etruscan\r\ncities against Rome. War was carried on with varying success and some\r\nintermissions till 351, when a truce of forty years was agreed upon.\r\nAfter its expiration, hostilities were again for a short time renewed;\r\nbut in 309 another truce was concluded, in the course of which Tarquinii\r\nseems to have gradually become subject to Rome. It continued to be a\r\nflourishing town under the empire, and after its fall, until it was\r\ndestroyed by the Saracens.\r\n\r\n=Tarragona= (anc. _Tarraco_). A seaport city of Spain, capital of the\r\nprovince of the same name, at the mouth of the Francoli, in the\r\nMediterranean, 52 miles west-southwest from Barcelona. The ancient\r\nTarraco was originally a Phœnician settlement; it afterwards became the\r\ncapital of the Roman province called by its name. After the fall of the\r\nempire, it was taken by the Goths; and at a later period was laid in\r\nruins by the Moors. In the 11th century the modern town was founded on\r\nthe site of the former. In 1705, it was captured by the English, but was\r\nafterwards abandoned; and in 1811 it was taken and sacked by the French\r\nunder Suchet.\r\n\r\n=Tarred-links.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Tarsus= (now _Tersus_). Anciently the chief city of Cilicia, and one of\r\nthe most important in all Asia Minor, situated on both sides of the\r\nnavigable river Cydnus, about 18 miles from the sea. In the time of\r\nXenophon, who gives us the first historical notice of Tarsus, it was\r\ntaken by Cyrus. At the time of the Macedonian invasion, it was held by\r\nthe Persian troops, who were prevented from burning it by Alexander’s\r\narrival. It played an important part as a military post in the wars of\r\nthe successors of Alexander, and under the Syrian kings. As the power of\r\nthe Seleucidæ declined, it suffered much from the oppression of its\r\ngovernors, and from the wars between the members of the royal family. At\r\nthe time of the Mithridatic war, it suffered, on the one hand, from\r\nTigranes, who overran Cilicia, and, on the other, from the pirates, who\r\nhad their strongholds in the mountains of Cilicia Aspera, and made\r\nfrequent incursions into the level country. From both these enemies it\r\nwas rescued by Pompey, 66 B.C. In the civil war it took part with Cæsar.\r\nFor this the inhabitants were severely punished by Cassius, but were\r\nrecompensed by Antony, who made Tarsus a free city. It was the scene of\r\nimportant events in the wars with the Persians, the Arabs, and the\r\nTurks, and also in the Crusades.\r\n\r\n=Tartares= (_Fr._). A word used in the French army to distinguish\r\nofficers’ servants and batmen from the soldiers who serve in the ranks.\r\n_Tartare_ likewise means a groom.\r\n\r\n=Tartary= (properly _Tatary_). Is the name under which, in the Middle\r\nAges, was comprised the whole central belt of Central Asia and Eastern\r\nEurope, from the Sea of Japan to the Dnieper, including Mantchuria,\r\nMongolia, Eastern Turkestan, Independent Turkestan, the Kalmuck and the\r\nKirghis steppes, and the old khanates of Kasan, Astrakhan, and the\r\nCrimea, and even the Cossack countries; and hence arose a distinction of\r\nTartary into European and Asiatic. But latterly the name Tartary had a\r\nmuch more limited signification, including only that tract bounded on\r\nthe north by Siberia, and on the south by China and Thibet, along with\r\nIndependent Turkestan; and at the present day, many writers apply it as\r\na synonym for Turkestan. The Tartars (or, more properly, Tatars) was\r\noriginally a name of the Mongolic races, but came to be extended to all\r\nthe tribes brought under Mongolic sway by Genghis Khan and his\r\nsuccessors, including Tungusic and Turkic races. The term is therefore\r\nnot to be considered as ethnological, though all, or almost all, the\r\npeoples included under it, in its widest sense, belong to the Turanian\r\nfamily, but is rather to be understood in the same sense as the term\r\n“Franks” used by the Mohammedans. During the decline of the Roman\r\nempire, these tribes began to seek more fertile regions; and the first\r\nwho reached the frontier of Italy were the Huns, the ancestors of the\r\nmodern Mongols. The first acknowledged sovereign of this vast country\r\nwas the famous Genghis Khan. His empire by the conquest of China,\r\nPersia, and all Central Asia (1206-27), became one of the most\r\nformidable ever established; but it was split into parts in a few\r\nreigns. Timur, or Tamerlane, again conquered Persia, broke the power of\r\nthe Turks in Asia Minor (1370-1400), and founded the Mogul dynasty in\r\nIndia, which began with Baber in 1525, and formed the most splendid\r\ncourt in Asia, till the close of the 18th century. The Calmucks, a\r\nbranch of the Tartars, expelled from China, settled on the banks of the\r\nVolga in 1672, but returned in 1771, and thousands perished on the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n=Tasa.= In the East Indies, a kind of drum, formed of a hemisphere of\r\ncopper, hollowed out and covered with goat-skin. It is hung before from\r\nthe shoulders, and beat with two rattans.\r\n\r\n=Taslet.= A piece of armor formerly worn on the thigh.\r\n\r\n=Tasse.= Formerly a piece of armor for the thighs; an appendage to the\r\nancient corselet, consisting of skirts of iron that covered the thighs,\r\nfastened to the cuirass with hooks.\r\n\r\n=Tattoo.= The evening sound of drum or trumpet, after which the roll is\r\ncalled, and all soldiers not on leave of absence should be in their\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n=Tau, Cross.= In heraldry, a cross of a form somewhat resembling the\r\nGreek letter _Tau_. St. Anthony is generally represented with a cross of\r\nthis description, embroidered on the left side of his garment.\r\n\r\n=Taulantii.= A people of Illyria, in the neighborhood of Epidamnus. One\r\nof their most powerful kings was Glaucias, who fought against Alexander\r\nthe Great.\r\n\r\n=Taunton.= A town of England, county of Somerset, on the river Tone. It\r\nwas taken by Perkin Warbeck, September, 1497; and here he was\r\nsurrendered to Henry VII. October 5 following. The Duke of Monmouth was\r\nproclaimed king of Taunton, June 20, 1685; and it was the scene of the\r\n“bloody assize” held by Jeffreys upon the rebels in August.\r\n\r\n=Taupins=, or =Francs-Taupins= (_Fr._). A name which was formerly given\r\nto a body of free-arches, or francs-archers, in France. This body\r\nconsisted chiefly of countrymen and rustics.\r\n\r\n=Tauromenium.= An ancient Greek city in Sicily, on the east coast of the\r\nisland, about half-way between Messina and Catania. In 394, Dionysius\r\nbesieged the new city, and spent the greater part of a winter in an\r\nunsuccessful effort to take it. A peace was concluded in 392, in terms\r\nof which Tauromenium became subject to Dionysius, who immediately\r\nexpelled the former inhabitants, and supplied their place by mercenaries\r\nof his own. In 358, Andromachus collected the survivors of the original\r\ninhabitants of Naxos, and settled them at Tauromenium. Under Andromachus\r\nthe city made rapid progress. He assisted Timoleon in his expedition to\r\nSicily. At a later period the city was conquered by Hiero of Syracuse,\r\nand it remained subject to that city until, with the whole of Sicily, it\r\npassed into the power of the Romans. In the Servile war in Sicily\r\n(134-32 B.C.), it was captured by the insurgent slaves, and held by them\r\ntill the last extremity, suffering the utmost calamities, until the\r\ncitadel was betrayed to the Romans. It was taken and destroyed by the\r\nSaracens after a siege of two years, in 906.\r\n\r\n=Taxiarchs.= In the Athenian army, were ten in number (every tribe\r\nhaving the privilege of electing one), and commanded next under the\r\n_strategeoi_. Their business was to marshal the army, give orders for\r\ntheir marches, and appoint what provisions each soldier should furnish\r\nhimself with. They had also power to cashier any of the common soldiers,\r\nif convicted of a misdemeanor; but their jurisdiction was only over the\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n=Tchernaya.= A river in the Crimea. On August 16, 1855, the lines of the\r\nallied army at this place were attacked by 50,000 Russians under Prince\r\nGortschakoff without success, being repulsed with the loss of 3329\r\nslain, 1658 wounded, and 600 prisoners. The brunt of the attack was\r\nborne by two French regiments under Gen. d’Herbillon. The loss of the\r\nallies was about 1200; 200 of these were from the Sardinian contingent,\r\nwhich behaved with great gallantry, under the command of Gen. La\r\nMarmora. The Russian general Read, and the Sardinian general\r\nMontevecchio, were killed. The object of the attack was the relief of\r\nSebastopol, then closely besieged by the English and French.\r\n\r\n=Tearless Victory.= In 367 B.C. Archidamus, king of Sparta, defeated the\r\nArcadians and Argives in the “Tearless Battle,” so called because he had\r\nwon it without losing a man.\r\n\r\n=Tebet= (_Fr._). A kind of axe which the Turks carry at their saddle-bow\r\nduring war.\r\n\r\n=Teepe.= See WIGWAM.\r\n\r\n=Teflis=, or =Tiflis=. A city of Russia in Asia, in Transcaucasia,\r\ncapital of the province of Georgia. It was founded about the middle of\r\nthe 5th century, by a powerful monarch called Waktang; and afterwards\r\nrose to great importance. It was taken by Genghis Khan in the 12th\r\ncentury, and by Mustapha Pasha, 1576. In 1723 it was taken by the Turks,\r\nin 1734 by Kouli Khan, and it was destroyed by Aga Mohammed in 1795. It\r\ncame into the possession of the Russians in 1801. A treaty of peace was\r\nconcluded here between Russia and Persia, October 12, 1813.\r\n\r\n=Tefterdar Effendi.= The commissary-general is so called among the\r\nTurks.\r\n\r\n=Tegea.= An ancient city of Greece, forming one of the most powerful\r\nstates in Arcadia. The Tegeatæ long resisted the supremacy of Sparta,\r\nand it was not till the Spartans discovered the bones of Orestes that\r\nthey were enabled to conquer this people. The Tegeatæ sent 3000 men to\r\nthe battle of Platææ, in which they were distinguished for their\r\nbravery. They remained faithful to Sparta in the Peloponnesian war; but\r\nafter the battle of Leuctra they joined the rest of the Arcadians in\r\nestablishing their independence. During the wars of the Achæan league,\r\nTegea was taken both by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, and Antigonus Doson,\r\nking of Macedonia, and the ally of the Achæans.\r\n\r\n=Tekrit= (anc. _Birtha_). A town situated on the Euphrates, in\r\nMesopotamia. It was unsuccessfully besieged by Sapor I., king of Persia,\r\nin 260.\r\n\r\n=Telegraph, Field= or =Flying=. During the civil war (1861-65) in the\r\nUnited States a signal corps was organized, whose duties extended to the\r\nmanagement of field telegraphs, and light lines, when the formation of\r\nthe country was such that aerial signals could not be used, or it was\r\nfor any reason desirable that short electric lines be extended. It has\r\nbeen demonstrated that electric instruments may be of the most simple\r\nconstruction; and electric lines can be set up, and be utilized in\r\nplaces where a few years ago it was deemed impracticable to employ them;\r\nand can be worked without other skilled labor than that of the soldiers\r\nattached to the posts, and with no apparatus but such as can be had at a\r\ntrivial expense. There is no reason why, with properly drilled parties,\r\nelectric lines may not be thrown out in the moments which precede, or\r\neven during the progress of, a battle, and be so worked as to lessen\r\ninfinitely that difficulty of rapid communication which has so often\r\ncaused disaster. With a corps well organized and well equipped, the\r\nconnection between the corps of an army, and between the corps\r\nheadquarters and general headquarters, ought to be perfected in a very\r\nfew hours after the halt of the army. The field lines of the Signal\r\nCorps consist of rolls of wire carried in light-wheeled vehicles, and\r\nlight “lance poles,” us they are called, on which the wire is stretched\r\nwhen necessary. The wire made for the purpose is of small strands of\r\niron and copper twisted, to give it strength and flexibility. It is\r\ninsulated with prepared india-rubber, or other material, and wound on\r\nreels which, in an emergency, can be carried anywhere by hand, while the\r\nwire reeling out can be raised upon fences, fastened to trees, or laid\r\nalong the ground. The instruments used at first were of a kind known as\r\nthe Beardslee instrument. These instruments are worked without\r\nbatteries, the electric current being generated by revolving magnets.\r\nThey were “indicating,” an index upon a dial pointing, at the receiving\r\nstation, to whatever letter was designated by the index handle upon a\r\nsimilar dial at the sending station. There were as advantages attaching\r\nto this instrument, that it was portable and compact, could be set at\r\nwork anywhere, required no batteries, acids, or fluids; and what was\r\nthought of importance in the early days of the civil war, and while the\r\ncorps was a temporary organization, it could be worked by soldiers\r\nwithout skill as operators. The defects were, that messages could not be\r\nsent as rapidly or as far as by some other instruments. Nor could\r\nseveral instruments work easily upon a single circuit. For some uses on\r\nthe field of battle, or under fire, where the attention of the reader is\r\ndisturbed, it is, perhaps, as good an instrument as has been devised.\r\nWith a permanent corps, or at secure stations, it gives place to some of\r\nthe forms of signal or of sound instruments. The instruments upon field\r\nlines may be of very simple structure. The signal instruments, either\r\nthe needle or the letter instruments, can be used in actual conflict, if\r\nthe reports of heavy guns or other disturbances of action render reading\r\nby sound unreliable. The manufacture of both instruments and batteries\r\nhas been improved, until there is now no trouble in carrying either in\r\nthe field in the roughest campaigns. The difficulty in reading from\r\ntelegraphic instruments by sound, which has been the greatest obstacle\r\nto their use, can be almost done away with by using them with codes of\r\neasy signals. In the Prussian army, also, the electric telegraph is\r\napplied for field purposes. Morse’s system is used. Each headquarters of\r\nan army and each army corps, has a telegraphic division of 3 officers,\r\n137 men, 73 horses, and 10 wagons. Two of the latter are fitted up as\r\noperating-rooms, and the other 8 are used for carrying poles and other\r\nmaterial, including 5 miles of wire to each wagon, which can be reeled\r\noff by the moving of the vehicle. Of the whole 40 miles, 5 are\r\ninsulated, and can be run along the ground. It will be seen that each\r\narmy corps can put out 40 miles of line without recourse to other wires,\r\nbut use is always made of lines found in the country, in case they will\r\nanswer. Single poles of light material are used, without joints, and\r\nabout 10 feet long, and only every third pole is put in the ground. The\r\n_personnel_ is brought into the army from the civil telegraphic service\r\nat home. While in the field, the operators assume military rank, and,\r\nlike agents of the Post-office Department, are known as “military\r\nofficials,” not as “military officers.” The men are on a footing with\r\ntrain-soldiers. The operating-wagons are a little larger than the Rucker\r\nambulances of the U. S. service, but much heavier. Just in the rear of\r\nthe driver is a partition shutting off the rear portion of the carriage.\r\nAt his back, and under his seat, is a capacious box, in which are\r\ncarried tools, and the material necessary in telegraphing. On one side\r\nof the rear closed portion is a neat table with a compact operating\r\ninstrument on it, and a battery under it; and on the opposite side is\r\nthe operator’s bench, the space underneath it being also economized. On\r\nthe outside near the table are sockets, with thumb-screws connected with\r\nthe battery, to receive the wires. During the Franco-Prussian war,\r\nbesides keeping the king in telegraphic communication with his\r\nministers, lines were run from Gen. von Moltke’s headquarters to all the\r\ndifferent corps in the field. The telegraph corps always evinced\r\nadmirable promptness in keeping the lines closed up as the army moved\r\nforward. In Great Britain, the system of military telegraphy forms part\r\nof the duties of the Royal Engineers.\r\n\r\n=Telemeter.= An instrument for determining long distances. (See\r\nRANGE-FINDER.) One of the best-known telemeters is the invention of\r\nCapt. A. Gautier of the French army. It consists of a short tube\r\ncontaining two mirrors set at an angle of 45° with each other, one of\r\nwhich is fixed; the other admits of a slight rotation. A hole in the\r\nside of the tube allows the image of a secondary distant object on the\r\nprolongation of the base-line to be brought in line with that of the\r\ndistant object whose distance is to be measured. An observation is next\r\ntaken from the other end of the short base-line, and the image of the\r\nsecondary object again brought in contact with that of the principal\r\nobject by rotating a ring on the front of the tube. The extent of this\r\nrotation (as denoted by a scale), gives a factor which, multiplied by\r\nthe base-line, gives the required distance.\r\n\r\nThe Boulongè telemeter is an instrument devised for ascertaining the\r\ndistance to a point by means of sound proceeding from the point to the\r\nplace of observation. The one used for artillery consists of a glass\r\ntube about 6 inches in length, filled with a transparent liquid that\r\ndoes not freeze except with intense cold. In the liquid is a metallic\r\ndisk, which moves freely from one end of the tube to the other. It is so\r\nadjusted that the motion will be uniform and comparatively slow. The\r\ntube is inclosed in a brass case, to which is attached a scale, after\r\nthe fashion of a thermometer. This scale is marked for each hundred\r\nyards up to 4000. The divisions on the scale show the distance, in\r\nyards, through which sound will travel in air during the time required\r\nfor the disk to descend over the space on the scale marked by the\r\ncorresponding number of yards. The instrument must be held vertically,\r\nor as nearly so as possible. To arrest the motion of the disk at any\r\npoint, the instrument is quickly turned to a horizontal position.\r\n\r\nTo use it for determining the time of flight of shells it is held in the\r\nright hand, back of the hand up, with the zero of the instrument to the\r\nleft; a turn of the wrist to the right brings the instrument vertical,\r\nwith the zero end uppermost; the disk then descends, and a turn of the\r\nwrist to the left arrests its motion. The observer, holding the\r\ninstrument as described, watches for the flash of the shell, and upon\r\nseeing it instantly brings the instrument to a vertical position; upon\r\nhearing the report from the shell he instantly turns it back again. The\r\nposition of the disk indicates the number of yards from the observer to\r\nwhere the shell exploded.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the distance to an enemy’s battery, the instrument is held\r\nand turned in the same manner. The observer watches for the flash of a\r\ngun; observing which, he turns the instrument, and when he hears the\r\nreport turns it back and reads off the distance. Each hundred yards on\r\nthe scale is subdivided into quarters.\r\n\r\nThe telemeter invented by Capt. A. Gautier of the French army is an\r\ninstrument for measuring, with a great degree of approximation, any\r\ndifference, not exceeding three degrees, which may be exhibited in the\r\nbearing of a distant object by viewing it from different points of a\r\nbase-line transverse to its general direction from the observer. The\r\ninstrument, in its simplicity, accuracy, and portability, recommends\r\nitself in all cases where a knowledge of distances is desired at any\r\nmoment and with the least possible delay; such, for instance, as\r\nrange-finding, river-crossing, reconnoitring, and the like. A slight\r\nacquaintance with its use on such occasions enables the observer to\r\nestimate, with more than ordinary promptitude and precision, the\r\ndistance which it might be all-important to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe instrument resembles in shape and size one barrel of an ordinary\r\nreconnoitring- or field-glass. The case in which it is carried is\r\nfashioned so as to answer as a handle for holding the instrument when\r\nmaking observations. Within the barrel of the instrument are placed two\r\nmirrors at an angle of 45° with each other; this angle can be varied\r\nwithin certain limits by means of a milled-headed screw acting on one of\r\nthem. The mirrors are thus made to operate upon the principle of the\r\nsextant. A slot on one side of the barrel permits the rays of light from\r\nan object to fall upon one of the mirrors, from whence they are\r\nreflected upon the other mirror, and the image is seen through the\r\neye-glass at the small end of the instrument. At the front or large end\r\nis fixed, in a ring surrounding the barrel, a prism, whose displacement\r\nmodifies the direction of an object seen through it. At the rear of the\r\ninstrument is a small eye-glass, by means of which the observer sees,\r\n_over_ the mirrors and through the prism, the object which is before\r\nhim, and by double reflection in the mirrors the object to the side of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe American general Berdan has invented a large telemeter for garrison\r\nand sea-coast service which has been tested in Germany in 1875 and 1876\r\nand found to be very exact in the determination of distances. He has\r\nalso constructed a new model for field and mountain artillery which can\r\nbe packed up and transported on horseback.\r\n\r\n=Telephone.= An instrument for reproducing sounds, especially articulate\r\nspeech, at a distance, by the aid of electricity or electro-magnetism.\r\nIt consists essentially of a device by which currents of electricity,\r\nproduced by the sounds, and exactly corresponding in duration and\r\nintensity to the vibrations of the air which attend them, are\r\ntransmitted to a distant station, and there, acting on suitable\r\nmechanism, reproduce similar sounds by repeating the vibrations.\r\nTelephones were recently used by Sir Garnet Wolseley in the war in\r\nZululand, and are being rapidly adopted in European armies.\r\n\r\n=Tell Off.= A military term, expressing the dividing and practicing a\r\nregiment or company in the several formations, preparatory to marching\r\nto the general parade for field exercise.\r\n\r\n=Tellenon= (_Fr._). An ancient machine used at sieges. See TOLENON.\r\n\r\n=Tellevas= (_Fr._). A large shield formerly used, similar to the\r\n_pavois_.\r\n\r\n=Tembu=, =Abatempu=, or =Tambookie=. Is the name of an important tribe\r\nof Kaffirs, occupying the region east of the present boundary of the\r\nCape Colony. In the earlier Kaffir wars, and even in the great one of\r\n1835-36, the Tambookie Kaffirs remained neutral, and even friendly to\r\nthe colonists; but in the war of 1848-49, they were induced to join the\r\nother tribes, and were defeated with great loss by a small colonial\r\nforce. In the war of 1851, they were much broken and scattered; but\r\neventually submitting to the British authority, they have quietly\r\nlocated themselves in the unoccupied country east of the White Kei and\r\nTsomo Rivers.\r\n\r\n=Temesvar=, or =Temeswar=. A town of the Austrian empire, capital of a\r\ncircle of the same name, and of the crownland of Banat. It is strongly\r\nfortified with walls, moats, and outworks. Temesvar has played an\r\nimportant part in modern history. It was in the hands of the Turks from\r\nits capture in 1552 till 1718, when it was regained by Prince Eugène,\r\nand strongly fortified. In 1849, it was besieged for 107 days by the\r\nHungarian insurgents, but it held out until it was relieved by Gen.\r\nHaynau.\r\n\r\n=Templar, Knights.= A celebrated religious and military order, founded\r\nat Jerusalem in the beginning of the 12th century, by Hugues de\r\nPaganes, Geoffroy de St. Omer, and seven other French knights, for the\r\nprotection of the Holy Sepulchre and of pilgrims resorting thither. The\r\nknights were bound by their rule to hear the holy office every day, or\r\nif prevented by their military duties, to say a certain number of\r\npaternosters instead, and were compelled to abstain from certain\r\narticles of food on certain days of the week. They might have three\r\nhorses and an esquire each, but were forbidden to hunt or fowl. After\r\nthe conquest of Jerusalem by the Saracens, the Templars spread over\r\nEurope; their valor became everywhere celebrated; immense donations in\r\nmoney and land were showered on them, and members of the most\r\ndistinguished families thought themselves honored by enrollment in the\r\norder. As the power and prosperity of the Templars increased, so did\r\ntheir luxury, arrogance, and other vices, which gave the French kings a\r\npretext for endeavoring to suppress them, and lay hold of their\r\npossessions. Their principal enemy was Philippe IV. of France, who\r\ninduced Pope Clement V. to accede to a scheme by which the whole members\r\nof the order were seized and imprisoned, their lands confiscated, and\r\nmany of them tried, convicted, and executed for capital crimes. The\r\nEnglish Templars were arrested by command of Edward II. In 1312, the\r\nwhole order throughout Europe was suppressed by the Council of Vienne,\r\nand its property bestowed on the Knights of St. John. The habit of the\r\nTemplars was white, with a red cross of eight points of the Maltese form\r\nworn on the left shoulder. Their war-cry was “Beau séant”; and their\r\nbanner, which bore the same name, was parted per fess sable and argent.\r\nThey also displayed above their lances a white banner charged with the\r\ncross of the order. Their badges were the _Agnus Dei_, and a\r\nrepresentation of two knights mounted on one horse,--indicative of the\r\noriginal poverty of the order.\r\n\r\n=Ten Thousand, Retreat of the.= See RETREAT OF THE TEN THOUSAND GREEKS.\r\n\r\n=Tenable.= Such as may be maintained against opposition; such as may be\r\nheld against attack.\r\n\r\n=Tenaille.= In fortification, is a low work, constructed in the main\r\nditch, upon the lines of defense, between the bastions, before the\r\ncurtain, composed of two faces, and sometimes of two flanks and a small\r\ncurtain.\r\n\r\n=Tenaillons.= In fortification, are works sometimes found constructed in\r\nan old fortress, on each side of the ravelin,--the short faces being\r\ntraced, on the prolongations of the faces of the ravelin, from the\r\ncounterscarp of its ditch; the long faces are directed for flanking\r\ndefense, to about the middle of the faces of the bastions.\r\n\r\n_Demi-tenaillons_ are very similar to tenaillons, excepting that their\r\nshort faces are directed, perpendicular to the faces of the ravelin,\r\nabout one-third or one-half down from the flanked angle.\r\n\r\n=Tencteri=, or =Tenctheri=. A people of Germany, dwelling on the Rhine\r\nbetween the Ruhr and Sieg, south of the Usipetes, in conjunction with\r\nwhom their name usually occurs. They crossed the Rhine together with the\r\nUsipetes, with the intention of settling in Gaul; but they were defeated\r\nby Cæsar with great slaughter, and those who escaped took refuge in the\r\nterritories of their southern neighbors, the Sygambri. The Tencteri\r\nafterward belonged to the league of the Cherusci, and at a still later\r\nperiod they are mentioned as a portion of the confederacy of the Franks.\r\n\r\n=Tenedos.= A small island belonging to Turkey, in the northeast of the\r\nÆgean Sea, off the coast of the Troad. It appears in the legend of the\r\nTrojan war, as the station to which the Greeks withdrew their fleet in\r\norder to induce the Trojans to think they had departed, and to receive\r\nthe wooden horse. In the Persian war it was used by Xerxes as a naval\r\nstation. It afterward became a tributary ally of Athens, and adhered to\r\nher during the whole of the Peloponnesian war, and down to the peace of\r\nAntalcidas, by which it was surrendered to the Persians. At the\r\nMacedonian conquest, the Tenedians regained their liberty. In the war\r\nagainst Philip III., Attalus and the Romans used Tenedos as a naval\r\nstation, and in the Mithridatic war, Lucullus gained a naval victory\r\nover Mithridates off the island. About this time the Tenedians placed\r\nthemselves under the protection of Alexandrea Troas.\r\n\r\n=Tennessee.= A Central State of the American Union, and third admitted\r\nunder the Federal Constitution. It is bounded on the north by Kentucky\r\nand Virginia, and on the south by Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. The\r\nearly settlers of Tennessee were slaughtered by Cherokee Indians in\r\n1754; but in 1756 a settlement was formed near Knoxville, then a part of\r\nNorth Carolina. Nashville was settled near the close of the Revolution;\r\nin 1790, Tennessee was organized as a Territory with Kentucky, and in\r\n1796 was admitted into the Union as a separate State. In January, 1861,\r\na proposal to secede from the Union was defeated, but in June it was\r\ncarried by a majority of 57,667. In ten months the State raised 50\r\nregiments for the Confederacy; 5 or 6 were also raised for the Union.\r\nThe State was the scene, at Knoxville and Chattanooga, of some of the\r\nmost important operations of the war, and eventually almost the whole\r\nState became a battle-ground. The State was readmitted into the Union in\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n=Tenney.= In heraldry, orange color, one of the tinctures enumerated by\r\nheralds, but not of frequent occurrence in coat-armor. It is indicated\r\nin engravings by lines in bend sinister, crossed by others barways.\r\n\r\n=Tent= (Lat. _tentorium_, from _tentus_, “stretched”). A pavilion or\r\nportable lodge consisting of canvas or other coarse cloth, stretched and\r\nsustained by poles; used for sheltering persons from the weather,\r\nespecially soldiers in camp. The early Greek, and afterward the\r\nMacedonian tents, were small coverings of skin, under each of which two\r\nsoldiers slept. Alexander the Great is said to have had a pavilion of\r\nextraordinary magnificence, which could contain 100 beds. The Roman\r\nsoldiers seem to have used two sorts of tents,--one, a tent proper, of\r\ncanvas or some analogous material, and constructed with two solid\r\nupright poles, and a roof-piece between them; the other more resembling\r\na light hut, of a wooden skeleton, covered by bark, hides, mud, straw,\r\nor any material which afforded warmth. The Roman tent held 10 soldiers,\r\nwith their _decanus_, or corporal. Modern military tents are all made of\r\nlinen or cotton canvas, supported by one or more poles, according to\r\nshape, and held extended by pegs driven into the ground. The tents used\r\nin the military service of the United States comprise the following:\r\n\r\n_Common_, or _A tent_, for the use of enlisted men, is 6 feet 10 inches\r\nin height, 8 feet 4 inches in width, and 6 feet 10 inches long; it holds\r\n6 men.\r\n\r\nThe officers’ tents are somewhat larger than the common tents, and are\r\nsupplied with low side-walls of canvas; they are generally called\r\n_wall-tents_.\r\n\r\nThe _tente-d’abri_, which was introduced into the American from the\r\nFrench service, with some modifications, consists of a tissue of\r\ncotton-cloth impregnated with caoutchouc, and thus made water-proof.\r\nEvery man carries a square of this cloth, with buttons and button-holes\r\naround, by which it is attached to the squares carried by his comrades;\r\n3 men generally sleep together in a tent made of those pieces.\r\n\r\nThe _Sibley tent_ (invented by Maj. Sibley, 2d Dragoons) is conical,\r\nlight, easily pitched, erected on a tripod holding a single pole, and\r\nwill comfortably accommodate 12 soldiers with their accoutrements. A\r\nfire can be made in the centre of this tent, and all soldiers sleep with\r\ntheir feet to the fire. This tent is hardly ever used.\r\n\r\nThere is also a _hospital tent_, which is made of heavy cotton-duck. In\r\nlength it is 14 feet; in width, 15 feet; in height (centre), 11 feet;\r\nwith a wall 4¹⁄₂ feet, and a “fly” of appropriate size; the ridge-pole\r\nis made in two sections, and measures 14 feet when joined. This tent\r\naccommodates from 8 to 10 persons comfortably.\r\n\r\n=Tent.= To cover with tents; to pitch tents upon; as, a tented plain.\r\n\r\n=Tent, Laboratory.= In artillery, is a large tent, which is sometimes\r\ncarried to the field for the conveniences of the laboratory men.\r\n\r\n=Tent-bedstead.= See CAMP-BEDSTEAD.\r\n\r\n=Tentful.= As much or as many as a tent will hold.\r\n\r\n=Tent-pins.= Are pieces of wood, which are indented at the top, and made\r\nsharp at the bottom, to keep the cords of a tent firm to the earth.\r\n\r\n=Tent-poles.= The poles upon which a tent is supported.\r\n\r\n=Teramo= (anc. _Interamma_). A town of Southern Italy, in the province\r\nof Abruzzo Ultra I., at the junction of the Tordina and Vezzola, 28\r\nmiles northeast of Aquila. In the plain below Teramo took place, July\r\n27, 1460, between the army of John, duke of Anjou, and the Milanese\r\nallies of Ferdinand I. of Aragon, one of the most sanguinary battles\r\never fought in Italy. After the contest at Castelfidardo (1860), Teramo\r\nwas the first Neapolitan city that opened its gates and gave joyful\r\nwelcome to King Victor Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n=Termini= (anc. _Thermæ Himærenses_). A seaport town on the north coast\r\nof Sicily, 21 miles east-southeast from Palermo, at the mouth of the\r\nriver Termini. The ancient _Thermæ_ was founded 408 B.C. Here the\r\nCarthaginians defeated the Romans with heavy loss (260 B.C.) during the\r\nfirst Punic war.\r\n\r\n=Ternate.= The northernmost of a chain of islands, on the west coast of\r\nGilolo, and formerly the seat of sovereignty over all the adjacent\r\nMolucca Islands. It was taken from the Dutch by the English in 1797, but\r\nit was restored at the peace of Amiens. It was again taken in August,\r\n1810, and once more restored to the Dutch, with their other possessions\r\nin India and the East, by the treaty of Paris in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Terre-plein.= In field fortification, the plane of site or level\r\ncountry around a work. The terre-plein of the rampart in permanent\r\nfortification, is the broad surface which remains after constructing the\r\nparapet and banquette.\r\n\r\n=Terror, Reign of.= See REIGN OF TERROR.\r\n\r\n=Tertiate.= In gunnery, is to examine the thickness of the metal of a\r\npiece of artillery, in order to judge of its strength. This is usually\r\ndone with a pair of caliper compasses. To _tertiate_ a piece of\r\nordnance, is to examine the thickness of the metal, in order to judge of\r\nits strength, the position of the trunnions, etc.\r\n\r\n=Teschen.= A town of Austrian Silesia, on the right bank of the Olsa, 38\r\nmiles east-southeast of Troppau. Here, in 1779, a treaty of peace was\r\nconcluded between Maria Theresa and Frederick II., by which the dispute\r\nof the Bavarian Succession was brought to an end.\r\n\r\n=Testri= (Northern France). Pepin d’Heristal, invited by malcontents,\r\nhere defeated and captured Thierry III., king of Austrasia, and\r\nestablished himself as duke, 687.\r\n\r\n=Testudo= (_Testude_). In ancient warfare, was a defensive arrangement\r\nof the shields, by means of which a body of men advancing against a wall\r\nfor assault or mining, sought to protect themselves from the darts and\r\nweapons of the defenders. The men standing in close order, joined their\r\nshields above their heads, the edges overlapping, until the whole\r\nresembled the shell of a tortoise (_testudo_). The name was also applied\r\nto a machine moving on wheels, and roofed over, under which soldiers\r\nworked in undermining or otherwise destroying the walls in a siege.\r\n\r\n=Tête-de-pont= (_Fr._). A field fortification in front of a bridge, to\r\ncover the retreat of an army across a river. They are generally formed\r\nin the shape of a redan, a system of crémaillères, horn- or crown-works,\r\nor portions of star-and-bastioned forts. In order to add to the defense\r\nof _tétes-de-pont_, reduits have been constructed within them, and the\r\ndimensions of their parapets are in general made larger than those of\r\nany other field-work, on account of their great importance. Sometimes\r\nthe area inclosed by a _tête-de-pont_ is temporarily made use of as a\r\ndepot for the stores necessary for the troops, in which case its tracing\r\nshould present a strong point of defense, well provided with artillery,\r\nand affording in several points egress. The tracing which has been found\r\nthe best for the passage of extensive trains of wagons and artillery, as\r\nwell as columns of troops, is formed of crémaillères, extending in such\r\na manner as to inclose a large area, and leaving behind each a passage\r\nwell guarded and secured by second crémaillères, fronting the passage,\r\nand forming a second line. Additional strength will be given to _têtes_\r\nof every kind by constructing small redans or batteries on the opposite\r\nside of the river, the fire from which may defend the ground in front of\r\nthe salient, and flank the faces of the _tête-de-pont_.\r\n\r\n=Tettenhall= (Staffordshire). It was probably at this place, then named\r\nTestenheal, that the Danes were defeated by the Anglo-Saxons sent\r\nagainst them by Edward the Elder, August 6, 910.\r\n\r\n=Tetuan.= A seaport town on the north coast of Africa, 22 miles south of\r\nCeuta. It was taken by the Spaniards under O’Donnell, February, 1860;\r\nand the treaty of Madrid, by which the city was evacuated in favor of\r\nthe Spaniards, was concluded October 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n=Teutoburg Forest.= Probably situated between Detmold and Paderborn, in\r\nNorth Germany, where Hermann, or Arminius, and the Germans defeated the\r\nRomans under Varus with great slaughter in the year 9. This defeat was\r\nregarded at Rome as a national calamity.\r\n\r\n=Teutonic.= A term applied to a group of nations, as well as languages,\r\nforming an important division or stem of the Aryan family. Of the\r\nvarious tribes and nations spoken of as inhabiting Northern Europe in\r\nancient times, it is often difficult to determine which were really of\r\nGermanic race, and which Celtic or Slavic. Of undoubted German nations\r\nwho took part in the destruction of the Roman empire the most prominent\r\nwere the Goths (which see), Lombards (which see), Vandals (which see),\r\nand Franks (which see). The term Teutonic is derived from _Teutones_,\r\nthe name of a nation or tribe first mentioned by Pytheas, who wrote\r\nabout 320 B.C., as then inhabiting a part of the Cimbric Chersonesus, or\r\nJutland. For the next 200 years there is no further mention of the\r\nTeutones, that is, not until 113 B.C., when they appear in history as\r\nravaging Gaul, and in conjunction with the Cimbri and Ambrones,\r\nthreatening the very existence of the Roman republic. The Cimbri having\r\ngone into Spain, the Teutones and Ambrones were at length defeated by C.\r\nMarius in a great battle at Aqua Sextiæ, in Gaul, 102 B.C. A similar\r\nvictory was gained by Marius in the following year over the Cimbri in\r\nthe plains of Lombardy.\r\n\r\n=Teutonic Knights.= One of the more celebrated of the military and\r\nreligious orders to which the Crusades gave birth. The sufferings of the\r\nChristian soldiers at the siege of Acre excited the sympathy of certain\r\nmerchants of Bremen and Lübeck, who rendered such important services by\r\nthe erection of hospitals and otherwise, that Duke Frederick of Suabia,\r\nwith the sanction of Pope Clement III. and the emperor Henry VI.,\r\nenrolled them in an order of knighthood. The habit of the order was a\r\nwhite mantle with a black cross; and the knights took vows of poverty\r\nand chastity, which in later times were not very strictly interpreted.\r\nIn the course of the 13th century, they were, with the sanction of the\r\npope, engaged in a bloody war to enforce Christianity on the heathen\r\nnations inhabiting the southern shores of the Baltic, which resulted in\r\nthe acquisition by the order of Prussia, Livonia, Courland, and other\r\nadjoining territories. Warriors from all parts of Europe in that and the\r\nfollowing century joined their standard, including Henry IV. of England,\r\naccompanied by 300 attendant knights and men-at-arms. The conquests of\r\nthe order raised it to the rank of a sovereign order, with a territory\r\nextending from the Oder to the Baltic, and embracing a population of\r\nbetween 2,000,000, and 3,000,000, the grand master having his seat at\r\nMarienburg, Prussia. The decline of the order began in the 15th century,\r\nand its fall was brought about partly by internal dissensions, and\r\npartly by the attacks of neighboring states. At the peace of Presburg in\r\n1805, the emperor of Austria obtained the rights and revenues of the\r\ngrand master, but in 1809 the order was abolished by Napoleon, its lands\r\npassing to the sovereigns in whose dominions they lay. The Teutonic\r\norder, however, still continues to preserve a titular existence in\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\n=Tewkesbury.= A town of England, in Gloucestershire, on the Avon, and\r\nnear its confluence with the Severn, 10 miles northeast from Gloucester.\r\nIt is a very ancient town. Within a mile of it was fought (May 14, 1471)\r\nthe famous battle of Tewkesbury, in which the Yorkists under Edward IV.\r\nand Richard III. inflicted a signal defeat on the Lancastrians.\r\n\r\n=Texas.= One of the southwestern of the United States of America, is\r\nbounded on the southwest by Mexico, from which it is separated by the\r\nRio Grande, and on the east by Arkansas and Louisiana. La Salle, the\r\nFrench explorer, erected a fort on Matagorda Bay, 1687. A Spanish\r\nsettlement and mission was formed in 1690, but soon abandoned. In 1715,\r\nthe country was settled by the Spaniards under the name of New\r\nPhilippines, and several missions established; but the Camanche and\r\nApache Indians, among the most warlike in America, and still the terror\r\nof the border settlements, hindered the progress of the country. In\r\n1803, when Louisiana was ceded by France to the United States, Texas,\r\nclaimed by both Spain and the United States, became a disputed\r\nterritory. From 1806 to 1816, settlements were formed, and several\r\nattempts made to wrest the country from Spain. In one of these, in 1813,\r\n2500 Americans and Mexicans and 700 inhabitants of San Antonio were\r\nkilled. Mina, a Spanish refugee, gained some successes, but was defeated\r\nand shot. Lafitte, a Gulf pirate, made a settlement at Galveston in\r\n1815, but it was broken up in 1821. In 1820, Moses Austin, an American,\r\ngot a large tract of land from the Mexican government, and began a\r\nsettlement, which rapidly increased; but many of the settlers were of so\r\nlawless a character, that in 1830 the government forbade any more\r\nAmericans coming into Texas. In 1833, a convention of settlers, 20,000\r\nin number, made an unsuccessful attempt to form an independent Mexican\r\nstate; and in 1835 a provisional government was formed, Sam Houston\r\nchosen commander-in-chief, and the Mexicans driven out of Texas. Santa\r\nAnna, president of Mexico, invaded the country with an army of 7500, but\r\nafter some successes was entirely routed at San Jacinto, April 21, and\r\nTexas became an independent republic, acknowledged in 1837 by the United\r\nStates, and in 1840 by England, France, and Belgium. In December, 1845,\r\nTexas was annexed to the United States, but was invaded by Mexico, which\r\nhad never acknowledged its independence. A war followed (1846-48) in\r\nwhich Mexico was defeated. In February, 1861, Texas joined the\r\nSecession, and furnished many soldiers and immense supplies to the\r\nConfederate armies. In February, 1866, the ordinance of secession was\r\nannulled, and in 1870 the reconstruction was completed, and regular\r\ncivil government restored.\r\n\r\n=Thanks.= Public acknowledgments for gallant actions.\r\n\r\n=Thapsus= (ruins at _Demas_). A city on the east coast of Bycazena, in\r\nAfrica Propria, where Cæsar finally defeated the Pompeian army, and\r\nfinished the civil war, 46 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Thasos= (now _Thaso_, or _Tasso_). An island in the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, belonging to Turkey, off the coast of Roumelia, 30 miles\r\nnorth-northeast of Mount Athos. It was at a very early period taken\r\npossession of by the Phœnicians on account of its gold mines. Thasos\r\nwas afterwards colonized by the Parians, 708 B.C. Before the Persian\r\nconquest, the Thasians were one of the richest and most powerful tribes\r\nin the north of the Ægean. They were subdued by the Persians under\r\nMardonius, and subsequently became part of the Athenian maritime empire.\r\nThey revolted, however, from Athens in 465 B.C., and after sustaining a\r\nsiege of three years were subdued by Cimon in 463. They were obliged to\r\nsurrender to the Athenians all their possessions in Thrace, to destroy\r\ntheir fortifications, to give up their ships, and to pay a large tribute\r\nfor the future. They again revolted from Athens in 411, and called in\r\nthe Spartans, but the island was again restored to the Athenians by\r\nThrasybulus in 407.\r\n\r\n=Thaulache= (_Fr._). Armor and weapons of the ancient French, consisting\r\nof small shields (_rondelles_), and halberd or spear.\r\n\r\n=Theatre of Operations.= See STRATEGY.\r\n\r\n=Theatre of War.= The term for any extent of country in which war is\r\ncarried on. It is synonymous with “seat of war.”\r\n\r\n=Theban Legion.= According to tradition, was totally composed of\r\nChristians, and consequently submitted to martyrdom rather than attack\r\ntheir brethren during the persecution of the emperor Maximin, or\r\nsacrifice to the gods, about 286. Their leader was canonized.\r\n\r\n=Thebes.= The name of a celebrated city; it was formerly the capital of\r\nUpper Egypt; it is now in ruins. It revolted against Ptolemy Lathyrus,\r\nand was captured after a siege of three years, in 82 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Thebes= (now _Theba_). The chief city of Bœotia, in ancient Greece, was\r\nsituated in a plain southeast of the Lake Helice, and northeast of\r\nPlatææ. The territory of Thebes was called _Thebais_, and extended\r\neastward as far as the Eubœan Sea. It was the scene of one of the most\r\ncelebrated wars in the mythical annals of Greece. Polynices, who had\r\nbeen expelled from Thebes by his brother Eteocles, induced six other\r\nheroes to espouse his cause, and marched against the city; but they were\r\nall defeated and slain by the Thebans. This is usually called the war of\r\nthe “Seven against Thebes.” A few years afterward, “the Epigoni,” or\r\ndescendants of the seven heroes, marched against Thebes to revenge their\r\nfathers’ death; they took the city and razed it to the ground. It\r\nappears, however, at the earliest historical period as a large and\r\nflourishing city. The Thebans were from an early period inveterate\r\nenemies of their neighbors, the Athenians. Their hatred of the latter\r\npeople was probably one of the reasons which induced them to desert the\r\ncause of Grecian liberty in the great struggle against the Persian\r\npower. In the Peloponnesian war the Thebans naturally espoused the\r\nSpartan side, and contributed not a little to the downfall of Athens;\r\nbut they joined the confederacy formed against Sparta in 394 B.C. The\r\npeace of Antalcidas in 387 put an end to hostilities in Greece; but the\r\ntreacherous seizure of the Cadmea by the Lacedæmonian general Phœbidas\r\nin 382, and its recovery by the Theban exiles in 379, led to a war\r\nbetween Thebes and Sparta, in which the former not only recovered its\r\nindependence, but forever destroyed the Lacedæmonian supremacy. This was\r\nthe most glorious period in the Theban annals; and the decisive defeat\r\nof the Spartans at the battle of Leuctra in 371 made Thebes the first\r\npower in Greece. Her greatness, however, was mainly due to the\r\npre-eminent abilities of her citizens, Epaminondas and Pelopidas; and\r\nwith the death of the former at the battle of Mantinea in 362, she lost\r\nthe supremacy which she had so recently gained. The Thebans joined the\r\nAthenians in protecting the liberties of Greece; but their united forces\r\nwere defeated by Philip of Macedon, at the battle of Chæronea, in 338.\r\nSoon after the death of Philip and the accession of Alexander, the\r\nThebans made a last attempt to recover their liberty, but were cruelly\r\npunished by the young king. The city was taken by Alexander in 336, and\r\nwas almost entirely destroyed; 6000 inhabitants were slain, and 30,000\r\nsold as slaves. In 316 the city was rebuilt by Cassander, with the\r\nassistance of the Athenians. In 290 it was taken by Demetrius\r\nPoliorcetes, and again suffered greatly.\r\n\r\n=Theodolite.= An instrument, variously constructed, used, especially in\r\ntrigonometrical surveying, for the accurate measurement of horizontal\r\nangles, and also usually of vertical angles. The theodolite consists\r\nprincipally of a telescope, with cross-wires in its focus, mounted so as\r\nto turn both on vertical and horizontal axes, the former carrying a\r\nhorizontal vernier-plate over a graduated plate or circle for aximuthal\r\nangles, and the latter a vertical, graduated arc or semicircle for\r\naltitudes,--the whole furnished with leveling-screws and levels for\r\nadjusting to the horizon, and mounted on a tripod. It is usually so\r\nconstructed that a horizontal angle may be repeated indefinitely around\r\nthe limb, and thus a large number of repetitions added mechanically, to\r\nsecure greater accuracy in the resulting mean.\r\n\r\n=Thermidor= (_i.e._, the “Hot Month”). Formed in the calendar of the\r\nfirst French republic the eleventh month, and lasted from July 19 to\r\nAugust 18. The 9th Thermidor of the Republican year 2 (July 27, 1794) is\r\nmemorable as the date of Robespierre’s fall, and the termination of the\r\n“Reign of Terror.” The name of Thermidorians was given to all those who\r\ntook part in this fortunate _coup d’état_, but more particularly to\r\nthose who were desirous of restoring the monarchy.\r\n\r\n=Thermopylæ= (literally, “the hot gates”). A famous pass leading from\r\nThessaly into Locris, and the only road by which an invading army can\r\npenetrate from Northern into Southern Greece. Leonidas, at the head of\r\n300 Spartans and 700 Thespians, at this pass withstood the whole force\r\nof the Persians during three days, August 7, 8, and 9, 480 B.C., when\r\nEphialtes, a Trachinian, perfidiously leading the enemy by a secret path\r\nup the mountains, brought them to the rear of the Greeks, who, thus\r\nplaced between two assailants, perished gloriously on heaps of their\r\nslaughtered foes. One Greek only returned home, and he was received with\r\nreproaches for having fled. Here also, Antiochus the Great, king of\r\nSyria, was defeated by the Romans, 191 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Thermum=, =Thermus=, or =Therma=. A strong city, the acropolis of\r\nÆtolia, Northern Greece, was captured and ravaged by Philip V. of\r\nMacedon, 218 and 206 B.C., on account of its favoring the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Thespiæ.= A city of Bœotia, Northern Greece; 700 of its citizens\r\nperished with Leonidas at Thermopylæ, August, 480 B.C. It suffered much\r\nthrough the jealousy of the Thebans, who destroyed its walls in 372 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Thessalonica= (now _Saloniki_, more anciently _Therma_). An ancient\r\ncity of Macedonia, situated at the northeast extremity of the Sinus\r\nThermaicus. It was taken and occupied by the Athenians a short time\r\nbefore the commencement of the Peloponnesian war (432 B.C.), but was\r\nsoon afterward restored by them to Perdiccas. At a later time, it became\r\nthe capital of the Illyrian provinces. It is celebrated at this period\r\non account of the fearful massacre of its inhabitants by order of\r\nTheodosius, in consequence of a riot in which some of the Roman officers\r\nhad been assassinated by the populace.\r\n\r\n=Thessaly.= The largest division of ancient Greece, lay to the south of\r\nMacedonia, and to the east of Epirus. Thessaly was originally inhabited\r\nby Æolians, who, however, were either expelled or reduced to slavery by\r\nimmigrants from Epirus about 1000 B.C. The inhabitants of Thessaly have\r\nbeen divided into three classes: (1) There were the Epirote conquerors;\r\n(2) those descendants of the original inhabitants, who, although\r\ndependent on the nobles, yet possessed a few privileges; and (3) the\r\nPenestæ, or those of the original inhabitants who had been reduced to\r\nserfdom. Thessaly never played an important part in Grecian history; it\r\nwas only after the Peloponnesian war it exercised any influence on the\r\naffairs of Greece. The Penestæ frequently rebelled against their\r\nmasters, who were very frequently at war among themselves. Jason caused\r\nhimself to be elected Tagus of all Thessaly about 374 B.C.; was\r\nassassinated in 370 B.C. The rule of Jason’s successors became so\r\nunbearable that, in 353 B.C., the old families called in the aid of\r\nPhilip of Macedon, who, in 344, subjected the country to Macedonia. In\r\n197 B.C., it was restored to freedom under the protection of Rome.\r\n\r\n=Thetford.= A town of England, in Norfolk, 95 miles north-northeast of\r\nLondon. It was taken and sacked by the Danes in 870.\r\n\r\n=Thin, To.= To make less numerous; as, to thin the ranks by a heavy\r\ndischarge of musketry.\r\n\r\n=Thionville.= A fortified town of France, in the department of the\r\nMoselle, situated on the Moselle, which is crossed here by a splendid\r\nbridge. This place was a residence of the Merovingian and Carlovingian\r\nkings, and was repeatedly besieged during the various wars between\r\nAustria and France. It was invested by the Germans in August, 1870, and\r\nafter bombardment, being in flames, surrendered November 24 following.\r\n\r\n=Thirty, Battle of= (Fr. _Combat des Trentes_). A name given, in English\r\nand French history, to a celebrated engagement which took place at a\r\nspot known as Midway Oak, half-way between the castles of Josselin and\r\nPloermel, France, March 27, 1351. The French general Beaumanoir,\r\ncommanding the former post, being enraged at the depredations committed\r\nby Bemborough, the English general, challenged him to fight. Upon this\r\nit was agreed that thirty knights of each party should meet and decide\r\nthe contest. The two chiefs presented themselves at the head of their\r\nbest soldiers and the battle began in earnest. At the first onset the\r\nEnglish were successful; but Bemborough having been killed, the French\r\nrenewed the struggle with redoubled courage and finally won the victory.\r\nThis was one of the most heroic exploits of the age, and gained such\r\npopularity that more than one hundred years later, when speaking of a\r\nhard contest, it was usual to say, “There never was such hard fighting\r\nsince the battle of the Thirty.”\r\n\r\n=Thirty Tyrants.= A body of thirty magistrates in Athens (404-403 B.C.).\r\nThey were appointed from the aristocratic party, by the Spartans,\r\nvictorious in the Peloponnesian war. The “tyrants” were guilty of the\r\nmost cruel and shameless acts, and after one year were expelled by\r\nThrasybulus.\r\n\r\n=Thirty Tyrants of Rome.= A set of military adventurers who from 253 to\r\n268 attempted to establish their own power in various parts of the\r\nempire during the reigns of Valerianus and Gallienus. The number thirty\r\nis borrowed from that of the famous Athenian tyrants. The names of only\r\nnineteen of these adventurers have come down to us.\r\n\r\n=Thirty Years’ War.= Was not properly one war, but rather an\r\nuninterrupted succession of wars (1618-1648) in Germany, in which\r\nAustria, the most of the Catholic princes of Germany, and Spain, were\r\nengaged on one side throughout, but against different antagonists. This\r\nlong-continued strife had its origin in the quarrels between the\r\nCatholics and Protestants of Germany, and the attempts of the former,\r\nwho were the more powerful body, to deprive the latter of what liberty\r\nof worship they had obtained. The severe measures taken by the emperor,\r\nthe head of the Catholic party, against the Protestant religion, led\r\nalso to strictures on their civil rights; and it was to protect their\r\npolitical as well as their religious liberties, that the Protestants\r\nformed a union, May 4, 1608, with Frederick IV., the Elector Palatinate,\r\nat its head. The rival union of the Catholic powers, under the\r\nleadership of the Duke of Bavaria, followed July 11, 1609. In Bohemia,\r\nthe immense preponderance in numbers (two out of three) and influence of\r\nthe Protestants, had forced from their Austrian king an edict of\r\ntoleration (July 11, 1609), which was at first faithfully observed; but\r\nduring the reign of Matthias, sundry violations of it were made with\r\nimpunity; and as the influence of Ferdinand of Styria, his successor,\r\nbegan to be felt in more flagrant partiality to the Catholics, the\r\nkingdom became a scene of wild excitement; three of the Catholic party\r\nwere thrown from the window of the Bohemian council-chamber at Prague,\r\nand ultimately Ferdinand was deposed, and Frederick V., the Elector\r\nPalatinate, chosen in his stead (1619); and Count Thurn, at the head of\r\nan insurgent army, repeatedly routed the imperial troops, and actually\r\nbesieged the emperor in Vienna. The Catholic princes, though as\r\napprehensive as their opponents of the encroaching policy of Austria,\r\ncrowded to the emperor’s aid; and while the Protestant union and James\r\nI. of Great Britain held aloof from Frederick, whose sole allies were\r\nBohemians (under Thurn), Moravians, Hungarians, and a Piedmontese\r\ncontingent of 3000 (under Count Mansfield), a well-appointed army of\r\n30,000, under Duke Maximilian, advanced to support the Austrians, and\r\ntotally routed Frederick’s motley array at Weissenberg (November 8,\r\n1620), near Prague, afterwards reducing the Upper, while an army of\r\nSpaniards under Spinola ravaged the Lower, Palatinate, and the Saxons\r\n(in alliance with the emperor) occupied Lusatia. The Bohemians were now\r\nsubjected to the most frightful tyranny and persecution; a similar\r\npolicy, though of a more modern character, was adopted towards the\r\npeople of the Palatinate,--the Protestant union standing aloof, and\r\nsubsequently dissolving, through sheer terror. But the indomitable\r\npertinacity and excellent leadership of Count Mansfield and Christian of\r\nBrunswick, two famous partisan leaders, who ravaged the territories of\r\nthe Catholic league, and the forced cession to Bethlem Gabor of large\r\nportions of Hungary and Transylvania, did much to equalize the success\r\nof the antagonistic parties. Here the war might have ended; but the\r\nfearful tyranny of Ferdinand over all the Protestants in his dominions\r\n(Hungary excepted) drove them to despair, and the war advanced to its\r\nsecond phase. Christian IV. of Denmark, smarting under some injuries\r\ninflicted on him by the emperor, and aided by a British subsidy, came to\r\nthe aid of his German co-religionists in 1624, and being joined by\r\nMansfield and Christian of Brunswick, advanced into Lower Saxony, while\r\nthe emperor, hampered by the political jealousy of the Catholic league,\r\nwas unable to oppose him. But when, by the aid of Wallenstein, a\r\npowerful and effective army had been obtained, and the leaguers under\r\nTilly, in co-operation with it, had marched northwards, the rout of the\r\nDanes by Tilly at Lutter (August 17, 1626), and of Mansfield by\r\nWallenstein at Dessau (April 1, 11, and 25, 1626), again prostrated the\r\nProtestants’ hopes in the dust; yet a gleam of comfort was obtained from\r\nthe victorious raid of Mansfield through Silesia, Moravia, and Hungary,\r\nthough his scheme for an insurrection in Hungary failed, and his death\r\nsoon after, at Zara, freed the emperor from a formidable and\r\nirreconcilable enemy. The combined Imperialists and leaguers mean time\r\nhad overrun North Germany and continental Denmark, and ultimately\r\ncompelled King Christian to conclude the humiliating peace of Lübeck\r\n(May 12, 1629). This second great success seems to have turned\r\nFerdinand’s head, for, not content with still more rigorous treatment of\r\nthe Protestants, and the promulgation of the _Restitution Edict_, which\r\nseriously offended even the Catholics, he stirred up Poland against\r\nSweden, and insulted Gustavus Adolphus, both personally and in the\r\npersons of his ambassadors,--insolent impertinences which he soon saw\r\nbitter reason to regret. The Catholic league now forced him to reduce\r\nhis army, and supplant Wallenstein by Tilly; while France was inciting\r\nGustavus to the willing task of aiding the Protestants in Germany. The\r\nwar entered its third phase by the landing of the Swedes at Usedom\r\n(June, 1630), and their conquest of Pomerania and Mecklenburg. Gustavus,\r\nby the exercise of a little wholesome pressure, induced the elector of\r\nBrandenburg to aid him; and though unable to save Magdeburg, he marched\r\nto join the Saxons, completely routed by Tilly at Breitenfeld (September\r\n17, 1631); victoriously traversed the Main and Rhine valleys; again\r\nrouted Tilly on the Lech (April 5, 1632), and entered Munich. By the\r\njudicious strategy of Wallenstein, he was compelled to return to Saxony,\r\nwhere he gained the great victory of Lützen; but his death, depriving\r\nthe Protestants of the only man who could force the confederate powers\r\nto preserve unity of action, was a severe blow to their cause; though\r\nthe genius and indefatigable zeal of his chancellor, Oxenstiern, and the\r\nbrilliant talents of the Swedish generals, preserved the advantages they\r\nhad gained, till the crushing defeat of Bernard of Weimar at Nordlingen\r\n(September 6, 1634) again restored to the emperor a preponderating\r\ninfluence in Germany. Saxony now made peace at Prague (May 30, 1635),\r\nobtaining such satisfactory terms for the Lutherans that the treaty was\r\nwithin three months adhered to by all the German princes of that sect,\r\nand the Calvinists were left to their fate. Final success now appeared\r\nto demand only one more strenuous effort on the part of Austria; but\r\nOxenstiern resolved to preserve to Sweden her German acquisitions,\r\npropitiated Richelieu, by resigning to him the direction of the war, and\r\nthe conflict advanced into its final and most extended phase. The\r\nemperor, allied for offense and defense with the Lutherans, was now also\r\nassailed through his ally, Spain, who was attacked on her own frontier,\r\nin the Netherlands, and in Italy; Bernard of Weimar fighting\r\nindependently, with the view of obtaining Alsace for himself, opposed\r\nthe leaguers; while the Swedes under Banér held North Germany, and by\r\nfrequent flying marches into Silesia and Bohemia distracted their\r\nopponents, and prevented them, after successes over Duke Bernard, from\r\nproceeding with the invasion of France. The great victory of Banér over\r\nthe Austrians and Saxons at Wittstock (October 4, 1636) restored to\r\nSweden the victor’s wreath she had lost two years before; and from this\r\ntime, especially under Torstenson and Konigsmark, the Swedes were always\r\nsuccessful, adding a second victory of Breitenfeld (November 2, 1642),\r\none at Yankowitz (February 14, 1645), and numberless ones of less note,\r\nto their already long list of successes, carrying devastation and ruin\r\ninto the hereditary territories, even to the gates of Vienna, defeating\r\nthe best generals of the empire, till, from a profound feeling of\r\ninability to check them, the Austrians hardly dared appear to the north\r\nof the Danube. On the Rhine, the leaguers at first had great\r\nsuccess,--the Weimar troops, now in French pay, were almost exterminated\r\nat Duttlingen (November 24, 1643); but after the Spanish power had been\r\nthoroughly broken in the Netherlands by Condé, the French were\r\nreinforced on the Rhine, and under Condé and Turenne, rolled back the\r\nleaguers through the Palatinate and Bavaria, and revenged at Nordlingen\r\n(August 3, 1645) the former defeat of the Swedes. The emperor was now\r\ndeserted by all his allies except the Duke of Bavaria, whose territories\r\nwere already mostly in the hands of Turenne and Wrangel; and a combined\r\ninvasion of Austria from the west and north was on the point of being\r\nexecuted, when, after seven years of diplomatic shuffling, with an eye\r\nto the changing fortunes of the contest, the peace of Westphalia put an\r\nend to this terrible struggle.\r\n\r\n=Thistle, Order of the.= See ANDREW, ST.\r\n\r\n=Thomas, St.= The principal of the Virgin Islands in the West Indies,\r\nbelonging to Denmark. In March, 1801, it was taken by the British, but\r\ngiven up at the peace of Amiens; it was again taken in the course of the\r\nsubsequent war, and restored to Denmark at the peace of Paris in 1814.\r\n\r\n=Thorn.= A fortified town of the kingdom of Prussia, in the province of\r\nWest Prussia, on the right bank of the Vistula. It is defended by walls,\r\nbastions, and two forts. This town was founded by the Teutonic Knights\r\nin 1232, and admitted into the Hanseatic League in the beginning of the\r\n14th century. It was taken by Charles XII. of Sweden in 1703, after a\r\nsiege of four months.\r\n\r\n=Thrace.= Anciently the name of an extensive country bounded on the\r\nnorth by the Danube, on the east by the Euxine, on the south by the\r\nÆgean and Macedonia, and on the west by Macedonia and Illyria. War and\r\nrobbery were the only honorable occupations of the Thracians. They lived\r\nto steal, either from each other or from neighboring peoples. When not\r\nfighting or plundering, they spent their days in savage idleness, or in\r\nquarreling over their cups. Courageous, or rather ferocious, after the\r\nfashion of barbarous peoples, they yet lacked the steady valor and\r\nendurance of disciplined troops; at all times, their warfare displayed\r\nmore fierceness and impetuosity than fortitude. In 513 B.C., Darius,\r\nking of Persia, marched through Thrace on his way to punish the European\r\nScythians, and on his return left Megabazus with 80,000 men to subdue\r\nthe country. In this he partially succeeded, but new disturbances and\r\ncomplications arose between the Persians and Greeks, which resulted (480\r\nB.C.) in the famous expedition of Xerxes. The consequence of the\r\nexpulsion of the Persians from Europe was the resumption of liberty and\r\nthe revival of prosperity among the Greek colonies in Thrace. Shortly\r\nbefore the Peloponnesian war, a native Thracian state--the Odrysian--had\r\nattained to great power and eminence under a ruler named Sitalces, who\r\njoined the Athenian alliance, but could not, in spite of his resources,\r\nprevent the triumph of Sparta in the north as well as in the south. The\r\nrise of the Macedonian kingdom, under Philip II. (359 B.C.), destroyed\r\nthe independence of a great part of Thrace. Under the government of\r\nLysimachus, the subjugation of Thrace became complete. On the fall of\r\nthe Macedonian kingdom (168 B.C.) it passed into the hands of the\r\nRomans, and subsequently shared the vicissitudes of the Roman empire. In\r\n334 a colony of Sarmatians, and in 376 another of Goths, was planted in\r\nThrace. In 395 it was overrun by Alaric, and in 447 by Attila. In 1353,\r\nAmurath obtained possession of all its fortresses, except\r\nConstantinople, and it has ever since remained in the possession of the\r\nTurks.\r\n\r\n=Thrasimenus Lacus.= See TRASIMENUS LACUS.\r\n\r\n=Throw, To.= To force anything from one place to another; thus,\r\nartillerists say, to throw a shot or shell, or so many shells were\r\nthrown.\r\n\r\n=Thrust.= Hostile attack with any pointed weapon, as in fencing. When\r\none party makes a push with his sword to wound his adversary with the\r\npoint, it is called a thrust.\r\n\r\n=Thud.= The sound of a bullet on hitting the intended object.\r\n\r\n=Thug.= One of an association of robbers and murderers in India, who\r\npracticed murder not by open assault, but by stealthy approaches, and\r\nfrom religious motives. They have been nearly exterminated by the\r\nBritish government.\r\n\r\n=Thumb-stall.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Thunderbolt.= In heraldry, a bearing borrowed from classical mythology,\r\nwhich may be described as a twisted bar in pale inflamed at each end\r\nsurmounting two jagged darts in saltire between two wings displayed with\r\nstreams of fire.\r\n\r\n=Thundering Legion.= During a contest with the invading Marcomanni, the\r\nprayers of some Christians in a Roman legion are said to have been\r\nfollowed by a storm of thunder, lightning, and rain, which tended\r\ngreatly to discomfit the enemy; and hence the legion received the name\r\nin 174.\r\n\r\n=Thurii=, or =Thurium=. A Greek city in the south of Italy, on the north\r\nshore of the Tarentine Gulf, was founded in 452 B.C., by a body of\r\nSybarite exiles, near the spot where their ancient city had stood till\r\nit was destroyed by the Crotonians fifty-eight years before. The rise of\r\na new colony re-awakened the anger of the Crotonians, and after five\r\nyears they expelled the Sybarites. These after an unsuccessful appeal to\r\nSparta for assistance, applied to the Athenians, who resolved to send\r\nout a colony along with the persecuted Sybarites. The leaders of this\r\ncolony were Lampon and Xenocritus. A war subsequently occurred between\r\nThurii and Tarentum, but was terminated by a compromise. In 390 B.C. the\r\ncity received a severe blow from a total defeat of their army by the\r\nLucanians. From this period it began to decline, and was at length\r\nobliged to submit to the Roman power, in order to escape the continued\r\nattacks of the Lucanians.\r\n\r\n=Thuringia.= An early Gothic kingdom in Central Germany, was overrun by\r\nAttila and the Huns, 451; the last king, Hermanfried, was defeated and\r\nslain by Thierry, king of the Franks, who annexed it to his dominions,\r\n530. It was after various changes and many conflicts, absorbed in Saxony\r\nin the 15th century. In 1815 it was surrendered to Prussia.\r\n\r\n=Thyatira.= In Asia Minor; was the place assigned for the battle at\r\nwhich the rebel Procopius was defeated by the army of the emperor Valens\r\nin 366.\r\n\r\n=Thymbra.= In Asia Minor, where Cyrus the Great defeated the confederate\r\narmy aiding Crœsus, and obtained supremacy in Asia, 548.\r\n\r\n=Tiberias.= A city in Palestine, built by Herod Antipas, and named after\r\nthe emperor Tiberias in 39. Near it Guy de Lusignan, king of Jerusalem,\r\nand the Crusaders, were defeated by Saladin; and Jerusalem fell into his\r\nhands, 1187.\r\n\r\n=Ticino=, or =Tessin=. A Swiss canton south of the Alps; it was\r\nconquered by the Swiss early in the 16th century, and made a separate\r\ncanton in 1815. It suffered by internal disputes in 1839 and 1841.\r\n\r\n=Ticinus= (now _Tessino_). An important river in Northern Italy. It was\r\nupon the bank of this river that Hannibal gained his first victory over\r\nthe Romans by the defeat of P. Scipio, 218 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Ticonderoga.= A town in Essex Co., N. Y., 95 miles north by east of\r\nAlbany. Two or three miles below this village are the ruins of old Fort\r\nTiconderoga, on the west shore of Lake Champlain. The fort was surprised\r\nby Col. Ethan Allen in the Revolutionary war.\r\n\r\n=Tien Tsin.= A city of China, situated 70 miles southeast from Pekin. A\r\ntreaty of amity and commerce was signed here between the French and\r\nEnglish on the one hand, and the Chinese on the other, in 1858. The\r\nviolation of this treaty, which was favorable to British interests in\r\nChina, by the Chinese, was the cause of the subsequent Chinese war.\r\n\r\n=Tierce.= A thrust in fencing, delivered at the outside of the body over\r\nthe arm.\r\n\r\n=Tierce=, =Tiercé=. In heraldry, a term of blazon used to indicate that\r\nthe field is divided by lines into three equal parts. A shield may be\r\ntierce in pale, in fess, in bend, in bend sinister, or in pall; all\r\nwhich, with other arrangements in tierce, are common in French heraldry.\r\nTierce in pale, in English heraldry, is an occasional mode of marshaling\r\nthree coats in one escutcheon under special circumstances.\r\n\r\n=Tier-shot.= Grape-shot is sometimes so called.\r\n\r\n=Tiflis.= See TEFLIS.\r\n\r\n=Tige-arms.= Sometimes called pillar breech-arms. Arms with a stem of\r\nsteel, screwed into the middle of the breech-pin, around which the\r\ncharge of powder is placed. The ball enters free and rests upon the top\r\nof the pin, which is tempered, and a few blows with a heavy ramrod force\r\nthe ball to fill the grooves of the rifled arm. This invention was an\r\nimprovement by Capt. Thouvenin on Delvignes’ plan of having a chamber\r\nfor the powder smaller than the bore. Capt. Minié’s invention superseded\r\nthe tige-arms, by means of a bullet which is forced to fill the grooves\r\nby the action of the charge itself at the instant of the explosion.\r\n\r\n=Tigranocerta= (ruins at _Sert_). The later capital of Armenia, built by\r\nTigranes. It was taken by Lucullus and the Romans, after a great victory\r\nover Tigranes, in 69 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Tigurini.= A tribe of the Helvetii, who joined the Cimbri in invading\r\nthe country of the Allobroges in Gaul, where they defeated the consul L.\r\nCassius Longinus, 107 B.C. They formed in the time of Cæsar the most\r\nimportant of the four cantons into which the Helvetii were divided.\r\n\r\n=Tilsit.= A town of East Prussia, on the left bank of the Niemen, or\r\nMemel, 60 miles northeast from Königsberg. Tilsit will be ever memorable\r\nin history for the treaties which were there signed between France and\r\nRussia on July 7, and France and Prussia on July 9, 1807. By the former\r\nof these Napoleon agreed to restore to the king of Prussia a great\r\nportion of his dominions, his Polish acquisitions being joined to\r\nSaxony, and his possessions west of the Elbe formed into the nucleus of\r\nthe new kingdom of Westphalia; Danzig was declared an independent city;\r\nthe Prussian province of Bialystock was ceded to Russia; the dukes of\r\nOldenberg and Mecklenburg, the czar’s relatives, were reinstated by\r\nNapoleon, and in return the Bonapartist kings of Naples and Holland were\r\nrecognized by the czar, etc. By the latter, the king of Prussia\r\nrecognized the kings of Holland, Naples, and Westphalia, and the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine; agreed to the cessions laid down in the\r\nRussian treaty, and to other minor alienations and concessions to\r\nSaxony, amounting in all to nearly one-half of his dominions; to the\r\nexclusion from his harbors of the commerce of Great Britain, and to the\r\noccupation of the Prussian fortresses by the French, till the payment of\r\nan enormous ransom. The weighty importance of the alterations effected\r\nby this treaty is, however, dwarfed before the startling magnitude of\r\nthe _secret provisions_ signed between France and Russia. By these were\r\narranged the resignation of the empire of the East to Russia, Roumelia\r\nand Constantinople being specially excepted by Napoleon, and the\r\nacquisition of the Spanish peninsula by France; the two powers were to\r\nmake common cause against Great Britain, and were to force the three\r\ncourts of Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Lisbon to join them; and Napoleon\r\nagreed to increase no further the power of the duchy of Warsaw, and to\r\ndo nothing which might lead to the re-establishment of the Polish\r\nmonarchy. By a further agreement, not put formally into writing, the\r\nmouths of the Cattaro, the Ionian Isles, Sicily, Malta, Egypt, and the\r\npapal dominions were to be taken by France; and Greece, Macedonia,\r\nDalmatia, and the Adriatic coasts, as the portion of Turkey; while on\r\nthe other hand, Russia was to obtain the rest of Turkey, and was allowed\r\nto seize Finland. These secret articles are given on most excellent\r\nauthority, and their correctness is further vouched for by the conduct\r\nof France and Russia for the next few years.\r\n\r\n=Tilt.= A thrust, or fight with rapiers; also, an old military game.\r\n\r\n=Tilted Steel.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR, STEEL.\r\n\r\n=Tilter.= One who fights or contests in a tournament.\r\n\r\n=Tilting-helmet.= A helmet of large size often worn over another at\r\ntilts.\r\n\r\n=Tilt-yard.= Formerly a place or yard for tilting.\r\n\r\n=Timariot.= A Turkish cavalry soldier who has a certain allowance made\r\nhim, for which he is not only obliged to arm, clothe, and accoutre\r\nhimself, but he must likewise provide a certain number of militia-men.\r\nThe allowance is called _timar_.\r\n\r\n=Timars.= Certain revenues, in Turkey, growing out of lands which\r\noriginally belonged to Christian clergy and nobility, and which the\r\nsultans seized when they conquered the countries they inhabited.

Homer represents Tiryns as subject to Argos;\r\nthe town was at a later time destroyed by the Argives, and most of the\r\ninhabitants were removed to Argos.\r\n\r\n=Titles, Military.= See military titles under appropriate headings\r\nthroughout this volume.\r\n\r\n=Tivoli.= A town of Central Italy, on the left bank of the Teverone, 18\r\nmiles east-northeast from Rome. In the Middle Ages, Tivoli was an\r\nimperial city, independent of Rome, and was the occasion of many\r\ncontentions between the emperors and the popes; in the course of which\r\nit was frequently taken and retaken as either party gained the\r\nascendant.\r\n\r\n=Tlemsen=, or =Tlemecen=. A town of Algeria, in the province of Oran, 67\r\nmiles southwest from Oran. It was once an important place; but in\r\nconsequence of a revolt of the inhabitants against his authority,\r\nHassan, the dey of Algiers, laid it in ruins.

This conflict is sometimes termed the battle of Muradal.\r\nIt was occupied by the French from 1808 till 1813.\r\n\r\n=Tomahawk.= A light war-hatchet of the North American Indians. The early\r\nones were rudely made of stone, ingeniously fastened to their handles by\r\nanimal sinews, or cords of skin. Traders supplied hatchets of steel, the\r\nheads of which were made hollow, for a tobacco-pipe; the handle of ash,\r\nwith the pith removed, being the stem. These hatchets are used in the\r\nchase and in battle, not only in close combat, but by being thrown with\r\na wonderful skill, so as always to strike the object aimed at with the\r\nedge of the instrument. The handles are curiously ornamented. In the\r\nfigurative language of the Indians, to make peace, is to bury the\r\ntomahawk; to make war, is to dig it up.\r\n\r\n=Toman.= In the East Indies, signifies 10,000 men.\r\n\r\n=Tom-tom.= A large, flat drum, used by the Hindoos; a tam-tam.\r\n\r\n=Tongue.= The pole of an ox-cart (local).\r\n\r\n=Tongue of a Sword.= That part of the blade on which the gripe, shell,\r\nand pummel are fixed.

The U. S. Corps of Topographical\r\nEngineers was merged into the Corps of Engineers in 1863.\r\n\r\n=Topography.= Is the art of representing and describing in all its\r\ndetails the physical constitution, natural or artificial, of any\r\ndetermined portion of a country; in making maps and giving a descriptive\r\nmemoir. Military topography differs from geography in seeking to imitate\r\nsinuosities of ground: it represents graphically and describes\r\ntechnically commanding heights, water-courses, preferable sites for\r\ncamps, different kinds of roads, the position of fords, and extent of\r\nwoods. It enumerates the resources that a country offers to troops and\r\nthe difficulties which are interposed. By means of colored maps and\r\nother conventional signs, military topography presents before the eyes\r\nof a general much that is necessary to guide his operations.\r\n\r\n=Torce=, or =Wreath=. In heraldry, a garland of twisted silk, by which\r\nthe crest is joined to the helmet. A crest is always understood to be\r\nplaced on a torce, unless where it is expressly stated to issue out of a\r\ncoronet or chapeau.\r\n\r\n=Torches.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Tordesillas.= A town of Spain, province of Valladolid. Here was signed,\r\nin 1494, a treaty modifying the boundary-line which Pope Alexander VI.\r\nhad assigned, in 1493, in his division of the New World between Spain\r\nand Portugal.\r\n\r\n=Torgau.= A fortified town of Prussian Saxony, on the left hank of the\r\nElbe, 70 miles south-southwest from Berlin. Here a battle was fought\r\nbetween Frederick II. of Prussia and the Austrians, in which the former\r\nobtained a signal victory, the Austrian general, Count Daun, a renowned\r\nwarrior, being wounded, November 3, 1760. It was besieged and taken by\r\nthe allied Prussians and Saxons in January, 1814; the besieged lost\r\nabout 30,000 men.\r\n\r\n=Tormentum.= A pistol; a gun; a piece of ordnance.\r\n\r\n=Tormes.= A river of Spain, falls into the Douro, on the borders of\r\nPortugal. Its banks were the scene of many conflicts between the French\r\nand Spaniards during the Peninsular war, from 1808 to 1814.\r\n\r\n=Toro.= A city of Spain, province of Leon, on the Douro, 20 miles east\r\nfrom Zamora. Ferdinand the Catholic defeated Alonzo V. of Portugal near\r\nthis place in 1476, and gained the kingdom of Castile for himself and\r\nhis wife Isabella.\r\n\r\n=Toronto.= The capital of the province of Ontario, Canada, on the north\r\nshore of Lake Ontario, 165 miles from Kingston, and 323 miles from\r\nMontreal. Its harbor or bay is capable of accommodating the largest\r\nvessels that navigate the lakes, and is defended at the entrance by a\r\nfort, which was thoroughly repaired in 1864 by the imperial government,\r\nand mounted with the most efficient modern ordnance. The town was\r\nfounded in 1794, by Gov. Simcoe. It was burned by the Americans in 1813,\r\nand suffered severely in the insurrection of 1837, on which occasion it\r\nwas the headquarters of the rebellion.\r\n\r\n=Torpedo.= During the war between Great Britain and the United States\r\nin 1812-14, this name was applied to certain mysterious boats invented\r\nby Fulton and other Americans for the purpose of navigating beneath the\r\nsurface of the water, and injuring the bottom of hostile vessels. In\r\nthose days of hand-to-hand naval war, these designs (which, by the way,\r\nwere failures) were looked upon as little less than diabolical. The\r\nprogress of destructive weapons during half a century has removed this\r\naversion, and nations do not scruple now to employ similar unseen agents\r\nfor offense and defense. The modern torpedo is really a stationary\r\nbomb-shell, intended to explode under the bottom of an enemy’s ship. The\r\nweapon was first used by the Russians in the Baltic in 1854; and in the\r\nAmerican war of Secession, 1861-65, it was employed extensively, and\r\noften successfully. The damage effected by a torpedo exploding beneath a\r\nship is very great; and although the failures are frequent by the\r\nexplosion happening at a wrong moment, the danger from torpedoes is\r\nconsiderable in fact, and far more in apprehension, for sailors\r\nnaturally dread navigating waters where destruction lurks at unknown\r\npoints concealed from view. There are several varieties of torpedoes,\r\nbut they may be divided into two classes,--those which are\r\nself-explosive on a ship touching them, and those which are dependent on\r\nan electric current supplied from the shore. The second are the safest\r\nfor friendly vessels; but they are rather uncertain in action, and can\r\nonly be employed at a moderate distance from the shore. The first are\r\nmore certain in action, as they can only explode on a ship, being\r\nsomewhere in contact, but they attack indiscriminately friend and foe.\r\n\r\n=Torque= (_Fr._). A metal collar formerly bestowed upon a Roman soldier\r\nwho had killed his adversary in a single combat.\r\n\r\n=Torqued.= In heraldry, twisted; bent;--said of a dolphin haurient,\r\nwhich forms a figure like the letter _S_.\r\n\r\n=Torre di Mare.= A village of Naples, at the mouth of the Bassento, in\r\nthe Gulf of Taranto. Its prosperity received a fearful blow when, after\r\nthe battle of the Metaurus (207 B.C.), Hannibal was compelled to give up\r\nthis part of Italy, and carried with him all the citizens of Megapontum,\r\nin order to defend them from the vengeance of the Romans. In the time of\r\nCicero the city still existed, but in a state of rapid decay.\r\n\r\n=Torres-Vedras.= A town of Estremadura, kingdom of Portugal, on the left\r\nbank of the Sizandro, about 30 miles north of Lisbon. It derives its\r\nreputation solely from having given name to those famous lines of\r\ndefense within which Wellington took refuge in 1810, when he found it\r\nimpossible to defend the frontier of Portugal against the French armies;\r\nand from which, in the year following, he issued on that career of slow\r\nand hard-won victory which ended in the expulsion of the French from the\r\nPeninsula. The _first_, or outermost of these lines, extending from\r\nAlhandra, on the Tagus, to the mouth of the Sizandro, on the sea-coast,\r\nand following the windings of the hills, was 29 miles long; the _second_\r\n(and by far the most formidable) lay from 6 to 10 miles behind the\r\nfirst, stretching from Quintella, on the Tagus, to the mouth of the St.\r\nLorenza, a distance of 24 miles; the _third_, situated to the southwest\r\nof Lisbon, at the very mouth of the Tagus, was very short, being\r\nintended to cover a forced embarkation, if that had become necessary.\r\nThe entire ground thus fortified was equal to 500 square miles.\r\n\r\n=Torrington.= A town of England, county of Devon, 10 miles\r\nsouth-southwest of Barnstaple. The name of Torrington emerges frequently\r\nduring the great civil war; and the capture of the town by Fairfax in\r\n1646, on which occasion the church, with 200 prisoners, and those who\r\nguarded them, were blown into the air by gunpowder, proved fatal to the\r\nking’s cause in the west.\r\n\r\n=Torse=, or =Torce=. In heraldry, a wreath.\r\n\r\n=Tortona.= A town of Italy, province of Alessandria, on a hill nearly\r\n900 feet above the sea. Tortona was once a strongly fortified city, but\r\nits last defenses were destroyed by order of Napoleon, after the battle\r\nof Marengo.\r\n\r\n=Tortosa.= A town of Spain, in Catalonia, on the Ebro, 42 miles\r\nsouthwest from Tarragona. It was taken by the French under Suchet in\r\n1811.\r\n\r\n=Tortu d’Hommes= (_Fr._). A particular formation which was formerly\r\nadopted by the besieged when they made a sortie.\r\n\r\n=Tory.= The word tory first occurs in English history in 1679, during\r\nthe struggle in Parliament occasioned by the introduction of the bill\r\nfor the exclusion of the Duke of York from the line of succession, and\r\nwas applied by the advocates of the bill to its opponents as a title of\r\nobloquy or contempt. The name has, however, ceased to designate any\r\nexisting party; the political successors of the tories are now commonly\r\nknown as conservatives. In the Revolutionary war of the United States,\r\nthe loyalists were called _tories_.\r\n\r\n=Touch-box.= A box containing lighted tinder, formerly carried by\r\nsoldiers who used matchlocks, to kindle the match.\r\n\r\n=Touch-hole.= The vent of a cannon or other species of fire-arms, by\r\nwhich fire is communicated to the powder of the charge.\r\n\r\n=Toula=, or =Tula=. An important town of Great Russia, capital of the\r\ngovernment of the same name, on the Upa, 110 miles south of Moscow. It\r\nis an ancient town, and has suffered severely from Tartar invasion, and\r\nduring the wars of the commencement of the 17th century. The Russian\r\narmy is largely supplied with muskets and small-arms from the works of\r\nthis town.\r\n\r\n=Toulon.= A great seaport and naval arsenal of France, department of\r\nVar. It stands at the head of a deeply-penetrating inlet of the\r\nMediterranean. It is a fortress of immense strength, and is surrounded\r\nby a double rampart, and by a wide and deep fosse. Toulon was destroyed\r\nby the Saracens in 889, and again by them about the close of the 12th\r\ncentury. It was only at the end of the 16th century that Toulon came to\r\nbe important as a naval and military stronghold. In 1707, it was\r\nassailed without success by the Duke of Savoy by land, and the English\r\nand Dutch by sea. It was taken by the English and Spaniards in 1793; but\r\nthe allies were obliged to evacuate the town in December of the same\r\nyear, after being fiercely attacked by the republicans, whose guns were\r\ncommanded by Napoleon,--then a simple officer of artillery,--who here\r\nevinced for the first time his genius and self-reliance.\r\n\r\n=Toulouse= (anc. _Tolosa_). An important city of France, capital of the\r\ndepartment of Haute-Garonne, on the right bank of the river Garonne, 160\r\nmiles southeast of Bordeaux. The ancient _Tolosa_ and its temple were\r\nplundered by the consul Q. Servilius Cæpio in 106 B.C. It was ravaged by\r\nthe Visigoths and Franks, who successively overran and possessed the\r\ncountry. A battle was fought here in 1814, between Wellington and Soult,\r\nin which the latter was defeated, and obliged to evacuate the town.\r\n\r\n=Tour=, or =Turn=. That which is done by succession. _Tour of duty_,\r\nturn to go on duty.\r\n\r\n=Tourbillon.= See PYROTECHNY.\r\n\r\n=Tournament=, or =Tournay=. A military sport of the Middle Ages, in\r\nwhich combatants engaged one another with the object of exhibiting their\r\ncourage, prowess, and skill in the use of arms, or for the honor of the\r\nladies attending. According to Ducange, the difference between a\r\ntournament and a _joust_ is, that the latter is a single combat, while\r\nin the former a troop of combatants encounter each other on either side.\r\nBut this distinction has not been always observed.\r\n\r\n=Tournay= (anc. _Tornacum_, or _Turris Nerviorum_, “Fort of the\r\nNervii”). A fortified town of Belgium, province of Hainault, on both\r\nsides of the Scheldt, near the French frontier. It was in the 5th and\r\nbeginning of the 6th centuries the seat of the Merovingian kings,\r\nsubsequently belonged to France, but at the peace of Madrid was included\r\nin the Spanish Netherlands. Subsequently it was oftener than once taken\r\nby France, but again restored by treaty. During the month of May, 1794,\r\nit was the scene of several hotly contested fights between the French\r\nand Austro-English armies, the most important of which was that of May\r\n19, in which Pichegru heat the Duke of York.\r\n\r\n=Tours.= A city of France, capital of the department of Indre-et-Loire,\r\n146 miles southwest from Paris. Near it Charles Martel gained a great\r\nvictory over the Saracens, and saved Europe, October 10, 732. This\r\nconflict was also called the battle of Poitiers. The church was pillaged\r\nby the Huguenots and utterly destroyed, with the exception of two\r\ntowers, at the revolution.\r\n\r\n=Tower.= A citadel; a fortress; hence, a defender.\r\n\r\n=Tower Bastion.= In fortification, is one which is constructed of\r\nmasonry, at the angles of the interior polygon of some works; and has\r\nusually vaults or casemates under its terre-plein, to contain artillery,\r\nstores, etc.\r\n\r\n=Tower of London.= In feudal days, a powerful fortress; then, and long\r\nafter, a state prison of gloomy memories; now a government store-house\r\nand armory, and still in some sense a stronghold; is an irregular\r\nquadrilateral collection of buildings on rising ground adjoining the\r\nThames, and immediately to the east of the city of London. The kings\r\nfrequently resided there, holding their courts, and not unfrequently\r\nsustaining sieges and blockades from their rebellious subjects. At\r\npresent, the Tower of London is a great military store-house in charge\r\nof the war department, containing arms and accoutrements for the\r\ncomplete equipment of a large army. It is needless to say that, viewed\r\nas a fortress, the Tower would be useless against modern arms. The\r\ngovernment is vested in a constable, who has great privileges, and is\r\nusually a military officer of long service and distinguished mark; the\r\ndeputy-constable, also a general officer of repute, is the actual\r\ngovernor. He has a small staff under him, and the corps of Yeomen of the\r\nGuard, more commonly known as Beef-eaters.\r\n\r\n=Towered.= Adorned or defended by towers.\r\n\r\n=Towers, Movable.= The _purgi_ of the Greeks, and the _turres mobiles_\r\nof the Romans, consisted of several stories, furnished with engines,\r\nladders, casting-bridges, etc., and moving on wheels, for the purpose of\r\nbeing brought near the walls. They were usually of a round form, though\r\nsometimes square or polygonal. Before the invention of guns, they used\r\nto fortify places with towers, and to attack them with movable towers of\r\nwood, mounted on wheels, to set the besiegers on a level with the walls,\r\nand drive the besieged from under the same. These towers were sometimes\r\n20 stories, and 30 fathoms high. They were covered with raw skins, and\r\n100 men were employed to move them.\r\n\r\n=Tow-hooks.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Town-Adjutant=, =Town-Major=. In Great Britain, officers on the staff\r\nof a garrison. They are often veteran officers, too much worn for field\r\nservice. The pay depends on the magnitude of the trust. The town-major\r\nranks as a captain; the adjutant as a lieutenant. The duties of these\r\nofficers consist in maintaining discipline, and looking after the\r\nfinding of the batteries, etc.\r\n\r\n=Towton.= A township of England, county of York, West Riding. Here a\r\nsanguinary battle was fought, March 29, 1461, between the houses of York\r\n(Edward IV.) and Lancaster (Henry VI.), to the latter of whom it was\r\nfatal, and on whose side more than 37,000 fell. Edward issued orders to\r\ngive no quarter, and the most merciless slaughter ensued. Henry was made\r\nprisoner, and confined in the Tower; his queen, Margaret, fled to\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\n=Traband.= A trusty brave soldier in the Swiss infantry, whose\r\nparticular duty was to guard the colors and the captain who led them. He\r\nwas armed with a sword and a halbert, the blade of which was sharpened\r\nlike a pertuisan. He generally wore the colonel’s livery, and was\r\nexcused from all the duties of a sentinel.\r\n\r\n=Tracing=, or =Outline=. Is the succession of lines that show the figure\r\nof the works, and indicate the direction in which the defensive masses\r\nare laid out, in order to obtain a proper defense.\r\n\r\n=Tracing-pickets.= These are short pickets, 18 inches long, and about 1\r\ninch in diameter, which are useful in marking out the details of\r\nfield-works. They are made rather more expeditiously than\r\nfascine-pickets, and should be tied up in bundles of 25 each. Every\r\nbundle weighs about 8 pounds when the wood is dry.\r\n\r\n=Track.= In gunnery, by track is understood the distance between the\r\nfurrows formed by the wheels of artillery carriages in the ground. It is\r\nimportant that the track should be the same for all carriages likely to\r\ntravel the same road, in order that the wheels of one carriage may\r\nfollow in the furrows formed by those of its predecessor, and thereby\r\nprevent a loss of tractile force. The track of artillery carriages is 5\r\nfeet, and the extreme length of the axle-tree is 6¹⁄₂ feet for field-,\r\nand 6³⁄₄ feet for siege-carriages.\r\n\r\n=Trail.= In tactics, to carry, as a fire-arm, with the butt near the\r\nground, and the muzzle inclined forward, the piece being held by the\r\nright hand near the middle.\r\n\r\n=Trail.= In gunnery, the end of a traveling-carriage, opposite to the\r\nwheels, and upon which the carriage slides when unlimbered. See\r\nORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Trail Hand-spike.= See HAND-SPIKE.\r\n\r\n=Trail-handles.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Trail-plate.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Trail-bridge.= See PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Train.= To teach and form by practice; to exercise; to discipline; as,\r\nto train the militia to the manual exercise; to train soldiers to the\r\nuse of arms.\r\n\r\n=Train.= A line of gunpowder, laid to lead fire to a charge, or to a\r\nquantity intended for execution.\r\n\r\n=Train, Artillery-.= See ARTILLERY-TRAIN.\r\n\r\n=Train, Ponton-.= See PONTONS, BRIDGE EQUIPAGE.\r\n\r\n=Train-Bands= (or more properly, _Trained Bands_). A force of militia,\r\nand not differing essentially from that force substituted by James I.\r\nfor the old English Fyrd, or national militia. The train-bands of London\r\nwere chiefly composed of apprentices; and their unruly doings formed\r\nthe subject for many facetious plays and tales. In the civil wars, the\r\ntrain-bands sided with the Parliament; and Charles II. restored the\r\nmilitia on its old local footing.\r\n\r\n=Trainer.= In the United States, a militia-man when called out for\r\nexercise or discipline.\r\n\r\n=Training-day.= In the United States, a day on which a military company\r\nassembles for drill, especially in public.\r\n\r\n=Traitor.= One who violates his allegiance and betrays his country; one\r\nguilty of treason; one who, in breach of trust, delivers his country to\r\nits enemy, or any fort or place intrusted to its defense, or who\r\nsurrenders an army or body of troops to the enemy, unless when\r\nvanquished; or one who takes arms and levies war against his country; or\r\none who aids an enemy in conquering his country.\r\n\r\n=Traitorous.= Guilty of treason; treacherous; perfidious; faithless; as,\r\na traitorous officer or subject. Also, consisting of treason; partaking\r\nof treason; implying breach of allegiance; as, a traitorous scheme or\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\n=Trajan’s Wall.= A line of fortifications stretching across the\r\nDobrudscha from Czernavoda, where the Danube bends northwards, to a\r\npoint of the Black Sea coast near Kustendji. It consists of a double,\r\nand in some places a triple, line of ramparts of earth, from 8³⁄₄ to 11\r\nfeet in height on the average (though occasionally it attains an\r\naltitude of 19¹⁄₂ feet), bounded along its north side by a valley, which\r\nbeing generally marshy, and abounding in small lakes and pools, serves\r\nadmirably the purpose of a fosse. During the war of 1854, Trajan’s wall\r\nbecame an important line of defense on the invasion of the Dobrudscha by\r\nthe Russians, and the invaders were twice defeated in their attempts to\r\npass it,--at Kostelli, (April 10), and Czernavoda (April 20-22).\r\n\r\n=Trajectory.= The increasing curve described by a projectile in its\r\nflight through the air. See PROJECTILE, PROJECTILES, THEORY OF.\r\n\r\n=Tralee.= A town of Ireland, chief town of the county of Kerry, on the\r\nriver Lea, 59 miles northwest from Cork. Tralee was destroyed in the\r\nrebellion of 1641.\r\n\r\n=Trani.= A maritime city of Southern Italy, in the province of Terra di\r\nBari, 25 miles northwest of the town of Bari. Trani submitted to the\r\nNormans in 1053. It was then the chief town of a vast country, and was\r\nan important harbor in the time of the crusades.\r\n\r\n=Transfers.= Soldiers taken out of one troop, or company, and placed in\r\nanother are so called. Non-commissioned officers or soldiers will not be\r\ntransferred from one regiment to another without the authority of the\r\ncommanding general. The colonel of a regiment may, upon the application\r\nof the captains, transfer a non-commissioned officer or soldier from\r\none company to another of his regiment,--with consent of the department\r\ncommander in case of a change of post. The transfer of officers from one\r\nregiment or corps to another will be made only by the war department, on\r\nthe mutual application of the parties desiring the exchange.\r\n\r\n=Transfixed.= An ancient term used to express the state of being\r\ndesperately wounded by some pointed instrument, as being run through by\r\na spear, javelin, or bayonet; pierced through so that the weapon is\r\nfixed in another body.\r\n\r\n=Transfluent.= In heraldry, passing or flowing through a bridge,--said\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n=Transfuge.= A turncoat, a deserter, a runaway; one who abandons his\r\nparty in time of war, and goes over to the enemy.\r\n\r\n=Transit-compass.= A species of theodolite, consisting of a telescope\r\nrevolving in a vertical plane on a horizontal axis, as in a\r\ntransit-instrument, combined with a compass, a graduated horizontal\r\nlimb, etc., used for running lines, observing bearings, horizontal\r\nangles, and the like; called also _surveyor’s transit_.\r\n\r\n=Transoms.= In gunnery, are pieces of wood or iron which join the cheeks\r\nof gun-carriages and hold them together; they are known as the front and\r\nrear transoms.\r\n\r\n=Transportation.= The act of transporting, carrying, or conveying from\r\none place to another; as, the transportation of troops, munitions of\r\nwar, etc.\r\n\r\n=Transportation of Artillery.= In transporting artillery by sea, divide\r\nthe total quantity to be transported among the vessels, and place in\r\neach vessel everything necessary for the service required at the moment\r\nof disembarkation, so that there will be no inconvenience should other\r\nvessels be delayed. If a siege is to be undertaken, place in each vessel\r\nwith each piece of artillery its implements, ammunition, and the\r\ncarriages necessary to transport the whole or a part; the platforms,\r\ntools, instruments, and materials for constructing batteries; skids,\r\nrollers, scantling, and plank. If a particular caliber of gun is\r\nnecessary for any operation, do not place all of one kind in one vessel,\r\nto avoid being entirely deprived of them by accident. Dismount the\r\ncarriages, wagons, and limbers, by taking off the wheels and boxes, and,\r\nif absolutely necessary, the axle-trees. Place in the boxes the\r\nlinch-pins, washers, etc., with the tools required for putting the\r\ncarriages together again. Number each carriage, and mark each detached\r\narticle with the number of the carriage to which it belongs. The\r\ncontents of each box, barrel, or bundle, should be marked distinctly\r\nupon it. The boxes should be made small for the convenience of handling,\r\nand have rope handles to lift them by. Place the heaviest articles\r\nbelow, beginning with the shot and shells (empty), then the guns,\r\nplatforms, carriages, wagons, limbers, ammunition, boxes, etc.; boxes of\r\nsmall-arms and ammunition in the dryest and least exposed part of the\r\nvessel. Articles required to be disembarked first should be put in last,\r\nor so placed that they can be readily got at. If the disembarkation is\r\nto be performed in front of the enemy, some of the field-pieces should\r\nbe so placed that they can be disembarked immediately, with their\r\ncarriages, implements, and ammunition; also the tools and materials for\r\nthrowing up temporary intrenchments on landing. Some vessels should be\r\nladen solely with such powder and ammunition as may not be required for\r\nthe immediate service of the pieces. On a smooth sandy beach, heavy\r\npieces, etc., may be landed by rolling them overboard as soon as the\r\nboats ground, and hauling them up with sling-carts.\r\n\r\n=Transylvania.= Is the most easterly crownland of Austria, and is\r\nbounded on the north by Hungary and Galicia, east by Bukovina and\r\nMoldavia, south by Wallachia, and west by the Military Frontier, the\r\nBanat, and Hungary. Transylvania is little noticed in history till the\r\nChristian era, when part of it was occupied by the warlike Dacians, soon\r\nafter whom the Sarmatian tribes of the Jazyges and Carpi settled in it.\r\nThe conquest of the Dacians by Trajan, however, did not include that of\r\nthe other two peoples, who proved very troublesome to the Roman settlers\r\nalong the Danube, till they were conquered by Diocletian, and the Carpi\r\ncarried away to Pannonia and other districts. In the middle of the 4th\r\ncentury, the Goths overran the country, defeating the Sarmatians in a\r\ngreat battle on the Maros, in which the monarch and the chief of his\r\nnobility perished; and they in their turn were forced in 375 to retire\r\nbefore the Huns and their confederates. The Gepidæ next took possession\r\nof Transylvania, till their almost complete extirpation, in 566, by the\r\nLombards and Avars. It was conquered by the Hungarians about 1000, and\r\nwas governed by woivodes till 1526, when the death of the Hungarian\r\nmonarch at Mohacs prepared the way for the union of the two countries\r\nunder the woivode John Zapolya; but the war which thence arose with the\r\nAustrians caused their complete severance, and Zapolya’s sway was, in\r\n1535, confined to Transylvania, of which he became sovereign lord, under\r\nthe protection of the Turks. The Saxons were summoned by the Hungarian\r\nmonarchs to act as a counterpoise to the increasing power of the nobles;\r\nthe firm protection and generous treatment accorded to the Saxons by the\r\nHungarian monarchs were rewarded by steadfast loyalty and succor in men\r\nand money whenever required. During the rest of the 16th century the\r\ncountry was distracted by the bitter strife between the Catholic party,\r\nwho were supported by Austria, and the Protestant party, who were allied\r\nwith the Turks; the latter party, headed successively by princes of the\r\nhouses of Zapolya and Bathory, generally maintaining the superiority.\r\nThe next chief of the Protestant party was the celebrated Botskay,\r\nwhose successes against Austria extorted from the emperor an\r\nacknowledgment of the independence of Transylvania in 1606. To him\r\nsucceeded Bethlem Gabor, the determined foe of Catholicism and Austria,\r\nwho did important service during the Thirty Years’ War. Between his son\r\nand successor, Stephen, and Ragotski arose a contest for the crown, in\r\nwhich the latter prevailed; but on Ragotski’s death, the civil war was\r\nresumed, till the complete rout of the Austrians by the Turks, under\r\nKiupruli, placed the sceptre in the hands of Michael Abaffi, who reigned\r\ntill his death, in 1690, as a vassal of the Porte. The Austrians now\r\nagain possessed themselves of Transylvania, despite the heroic\r\nresistance of Ragotski; and though Tekeli succeeded for a brief period\r\nin rolling back the invaders, the peace of Carlowitz, in 1699, again put\r\nthem in possession; and in 1713 Transylvania was completely incorporated\r\nwith Hungary. During the insurrection in 1848 the Hungarians and\r\nSzeklers (one of the races inhabiting Transylvania) joined the\r\ninsurgents and forced Transylvania to reunite with Hungary, despite the\r\nopposition of the Saxons; and the Wallachs, still little better than a\r\nhorde of savages, were let loose over the land, to burn, plunder, and\r\nmurder indiscriminately; the prostration of the country being completed\r\nin the following year during the bloody conflict which took place here\r\nbetween Bem and the Russian troops. In the same year Transylvania was\r\nagain separated from its turbulent neighbor and made a crownland, the\r\nportions of it which had, in 1835, been annexed to Hungary being\r\nrestored, as well as the Transylvanian Military Frontier, in 1851.\r\n\r\n=Trapani.= See DREPANUM.\r\n\r\n=Trapezus= (now _Tarabosan_, _Trabezun_, or _Trebizond_). A colony of\r\nSinope, at almost the extreme east of the northern shore of Asia Minor.\r\nIt was strongly fortified. It was taken by the Goths in the reign of\r\nValerian.\r\n\r\n=Trappings.= See HOUSING.\r\n\r\n=Trasimenus Lacus.= The ancient name of an Italian lake (_Lago\r\nTrasimeno_, or _Lago di Perugia_), lying between the towns of Cortona\r\nand Perugia. Trasimenus Lacus is memorable chiefly for the great victory\r\nobtained by Hannibal in 217 B.C., during the second Punic war, over the\r\nRomans, under their consul, C. Flaminius. Hannibal leaving Tæsulæ passed\r\nclose by the camp of Flaminius at Arretium, laying waste the country as\r\nhe proceeded in the direction of Rome. This, as the Carthaginian general\r\nintended, induced the consul to break up his encampment and follow in\r\npursuit, Hannibal in the mean time taking up a strong position on the\r\nhills on the north side of the lake, along which he was passing. The\r\nconsul, coming up early next morning, when the whole place was enveloped\r\nin mist, saw only the troops in front on the hill of _Tuoro_, with whom\r\nhe was preparing to engage, when he found himself surrounded and\r\nattacked on all sides. The Carthaginians thus had the Romans completely\r\nin their power, and took such advantage of the opportunity, that 16,000\r\nRoman troops are said to have been either massacred or drowned in the\r\nlake; Flaminius himself being among the first who fell; 6000 troops who\r\nhad forced their way through the enemy, surrendered next day to\r\nMaharbal. It is said both by Livy and Pliny that the fury on both sides\r\nwas so great as to render the combatants unconscious of the shock of an\r\nearthquake which occurred during the battle.\r\n\r\n=Trautenau.= A town of Bohemia, 25 miles north-northeast from\r\nKöniggratz. On June 27, 1866, the 1st Corps of the army of the\r\ncrown-prince of Prussia seized Trautenau, but was defeated and repulsed\r\nby the Austrians under Gablenz; on the 28th, the Prussians defeated the\r\nAustrians with great loss.\r\n\r\n=Traveling Allowance.= Is an allowance made to officers when traveling\r\nunder proper orders. An officer who travels not less than 10 miles from\r\nhis station, without troops, escort of military stores, and under\r\nspecial orders in the case from a superior, or summons to attend a\r\nmilitary court, shall receive 8 cents per mile. Whenever a soldier shall\r\nbe discharged from the service, except by way of punishment for any\r\noffense, or on his own application, or for disability prior to three\r\nmonths’ service, he shall be allowed his pay and rations, or an\r\nequivalent in money, for such term of time as shall be sufficient for\r\nhim to travel from the place of his discharge to the place of his\r\nresidence, computing at the rate of twenty miles to a day.\r\n\r\n=Traveling Forge.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR.\r\n\r\n=Traveling Kitchen.= Marshal Saxe, it is believed, first suggested the\r\nidea of cooking while marching, so as to economize the strength of\r\nsoldiers, have their food well cooked in all weather, and avoid the\r\nnumerous diseases caused by bad cooking and want of rest. Col. Cavalli,\r\nof the Sardinian artillery, has with the same laudable motive embraced a\r\nkitchen-cart in the improvements suggested by him to replace the wagons\r\nnow in use, and an attempt is here made to elaborate the same idea of a\r\n_traveling-kitchen_, designed for baking, making soup, and other\r\ncooking, while on a march. The cart is 12¹⁄₂ feet long, mounted on two\r\n6-feet wheels covered with a very light canvas roof with leather-cloth\r\ncurtains. A large range or stove forms the body of the vehicle; its\r\ngrate is below the floor, its doors opening on a level with it. A\r\n_Papin’s digester_ is inclosed above the grate, in a flue whence the\r\nheat may pass around the double oven in the rear, or straight up the\r\nchimney, as regulated by dampers. At the side of the digester, over the\r\ngrate, is a range, suited to various cooking vessels. The top of the\r\noven forms a table nearly 5 feet square, at which three cooks may work,\r\nstanding upon the rear platform. A foot-board passes from this platform\r\nto the front platform, where the driver and cook may stand. Stores may\r\nbe placed in the lockers at the side of the range, and under the rear\r\nfoot-board. The chimney may be turned down above the roof, to pass under\r\ntrees, etc., and may be of any height to secure a good draught. By\r\nbending the axle like that of an omnibus, the vehicle may be hung\r\nwithout danger of top-heaviness. Cooking vessels more bulky than heavy\r\nmay be suspended from the roof, over the range, when not in use. The\r\ndigester may have a capacity of 100 gallons, and an oven of 60 to 75\r\ncubic feet would be quite adequate to the cooking for 250 men; or the\r\ndimensions of the cart may be smaller, and each company of 100 men might\r\nhave its own traveling-kitchen, which would also furnish oven and\r\ncooking utensils for a camp.\r\n\r\n=Traveling Trunnion-beds.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, SIEGE-CARRIAGES.\r\n\r\n=Traverse.= The turning a gun so as to make it point in any desired\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n=Traverse Circles.= In gunnery, are circular plates of iron, fastened to\r\na bed of solid masonry, on which the traverse wheels, which support the\r\nchassis, roll.\r\n\r\n=Traverses.= In fortifications, are mounds of earth, above the height of\r\na man, and 18 feet thick, placed at frequent intervals on a rampart, to\r\nstop shot which may enfilade the face of such rampart. A fire of this\r\nnature, in the absence of traverses, would dismount the guns, and prove\r\naltogether ruinous. The traverses also give means of disputing the\r\nprogress of an assailant who has gained a footing on the wall, for each\r\ntraverse becomes a defensible parapet, only to be taken by storm.\r\n\r\n=Traversing-plates.= In gun-carriages, are two thin iron plates, nailed\r\non the hind part of a truck-carriage of guns, where the hand-spike is\r\nused to traverse the gun.\r\n\r\n=Traversing-platform.= An elevation on which the guns are mounted for\r\nthe defense of the coast, and generally for all sea-batteries, as\r\naffording greater facility of traversing the gun, so as to follow,\r\nwithout loss of time, any quick-moving object on the water.\r\n\r\n=Travois.= A rude but efficient mode of transportation for conveying the\r\nwounded over a level or rolling country, when ambulances are not at\r\nhand. It consists of two poles about 16 feet long and 4 inches in\r\ndiameter; two stretcher bars or poles, 2¹⁄₂ inches in diameter and 3\r\nfeet long; and a canvas or rawhide bottom, 5¹⁄₂ feet long and 2¹⁄₂ feet\r\nbroad; and if of canvas, with eyelet-holes at the sides and ends, which\r\nare to be lashed to the poles with rope. The rear ends of the\r\ntravois-poles rest on the ground, while the front ends are attached to\r\neach side of a mule, which draws the travois. The _litter_ is better\r\nadapted to a rough country. (See LITTER.) The ordinary teepe-poles with\r\nwhich the Indians pitch their tents when in villages are also used in\r\nconstructing the travois. The Dakota and Montana Sioux, who use\r\nmountain-pine or ash-poles, select straight, well-proportioned saplings\r\nof those woods, trim them down to the proper size and taper, and lay\r\nthem aside to season. The dressed poles are about 30 feet long, 2 to\r\n2¹⁄₂ inches at the butt, and 1¹⁄₂ inches at the other extremity. The\r\ncouch is oval, and the rim is made exclusively of ash, bent into the\r\ndesired shape when the wood is green. A net-work of rawhide is\r\nafterwards lashed to the rim and completes the bed. The bed is 3¹⁄₂ to 4\r\nfeet in its transverse, and 2¹⁄₂ to 3 feet in its conjugate diameter.\r\nTwo or three of the teepe-poles are lashed together, butts to butts,\r\nwith rawhide, and then lashed to the pack-saddle on the mule, the small\r\nends of the poles trailing the ground. The bed with the longer diameter\r\nis then laid transversely on the poles and lashed about 1 foot in rear\r\nof the animal. A blanket, piece of canvas, or buffalo-robe lashed to the\r\nlower half of the oval rim of the bed completes the outfit. This latter\r\ntravois is claimed by some officers of the army to be well adapted for\r\ntransporting wounded even over a rough country.\r\n\r\n=Tread.= In fortification, the tread of a banquette is the upper and\r\nflat surface on which the soldier stands whilst firing over the parapet.\r\n\r\n=Treason.= A general appellation to denote not only offenses against the\r\nking and government, but also that accumulation of guilt which arises\r\nwhenever a superior reposes confidence in a subject or inferior, between\r\nwhom and himself there subsists a natural, a civil, or even a spiritual\r\nrelation; and the inferior so abuses that confidence, so forgets the\r\nobligations of duty, subjection, and allegiance, as to destroy the life\r\nof any such superior or lord. It is, according to English law, a general\r\nname, in short, for treachery against the sovereign or liege lord. High\r\ntreason (the _crimen læsæ majestatis_ of the Romans) is an offense\r\ncommitted against the security of the king or kingdom, whether by\r\nimagination, word, or deed. In the United States, treason is confined to\r\nthe actual levying of war against the United States; or an adhering to\r\ntheir enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\r\n\r\n=Treaty.= An agreement, league, or contract, between two or more nations\r\nor sovereigns, formally signed by commissioners properly authorized, and\r\nsolemnly ratified by the several sovereigns or the supreme power of each\r\nstate; an agreement between two or more independent states.\r\n\r\n_A treaty of guaranty_ is an engagement by which one state promises to\r\naid another when it is disturbed, or threatened to be disturbed, in the\r\npeaceable enjoyments of its rights by a third power. Treaties of\r\nalliance may be offensive or defensive; in the former the ally engages\r\ngenerally to co-operate in hostilities against a specified power, or\r\nagainst any power with which the other may be at war; in the latter, the\r\nengagements of the ally extend only to a war of aggression commenced\r\nagainst the other contracting party. The execution of a treaty is\r\noccasionally secured by hostages; as at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in\r\n1748, when several peers were sent to Paris as hostages for the\r\nrestoration of Cape Breton by Great Britain to France. For celebrated\r\ntreaties, see appropriate headings in this work.\r\n\r\n=Trebbia.= A small but famous stream of Northern Italy, which joins the\r\nPo 2 miles west of Piacenza. On its banks Hannibal decisively defeated\r\nthe Roman consul Sempronius, 218 B.C.; the French were also defeated\r\nhere by Suwarrow in 1799.\r\n\r\n=Trebuchet=, or =Trebucket=. A machine used in the Middle Ages for\r\nthrowing stones, etc., acting by means of a great weight fastened to the\r\nshort arm of a lever, which, being let fall, raised the end of the long\r\narm with great velocity, and hurled stones with much force.\r\n\r\n=Trefle= (_Trefoil_). A term used in mining, from the similarity of the\r\nfigure to trefoil. The simple trefle has only two lodgments; the double\r\ntrefle, four; and the triple one, six.\r\n\r\n=Trefoil.= In heraldry, is a frequent charge, representing the\r\nclover-leaf, and is always depicted as _slipped_,--_i.e._, furnished\r\nwith a stalk.\r\n\r\n=Trench-cavalier.= In fortification, an elevation constructed, by a\r\nbesieger, of gabions, fascines, earth, and the like, about half-way up\r\nthe glacis, in order to discover and enfilade the covert way.\r\n\r\n=Trenches.= The communications, boyaux, or zigzags, as well as the\r\nparallels or places of arms opened by besiegers against a fortification\r\nare trenches. They are from 6 to 10 feet wide and about 3 feet deep.\r\n(See PARALLELS, and SIEGE.) _To mount the trenches_, is to mount guard\r\nin the trenches, which is generally done in the night. _To relieve the\r\ntrenches_, is to relieve the guard of the trenches. _To scour the\r\ntrenches_, is to make a vigorous sally upon the guard of the trenches,\r\nforce them to give way, and quit their ground, drive away the workmen,\r\nbreak down the parapet, till up the trenches, and spike their cannon.\r\n\r\n=Trenches, Opening of.= See OPENING OF TRENCHES.\r\n\r\n=Trench-shelter.= A trench hastily thrown up to give cover to troops on\r\na field of battle. It is always 1 foot 3 inches deep, and the parapet is\r\nfrom 1¹⁄₄ to 1¹⁄₂ feet high. A trench 2 feet broad can be made in from\r\n10 to 20 minutes; one 4 feet wide in from 20 to 40 minutes; and one 7\r\nfeet broad in from 30 to 60 minutes. There are also small trenches in\r\nrear for the supernumeraries.\r\n\r\n=Trenton.= The capital city of the State of New Jersey, on the left bank\r\nof the Delaware River, at the confluence of Assunpink Creek. In the war\r\nof the Revolution, Trenton was the scene of a night attack by\r\nWashington upon the British troops--chiefly Hessians--whom he surprised\r\nby crossing the Delaware, when the floating ice was supposed to have\r\nrendered it impassable, on the night of December 25 and morning of the\r\n26th, 1776.\r\n\r\n=Trepied.= In ancient times, a ballista was so called when supported on\r\nthree legs.\r\n\r\n=Tressure.= In heraldry, a subordinary, generally said to be half the\r\nbreadth of the orle, and usually borne double, and flowered and\r\ncounterflowered with fleurs-de-lis. It forms part of the royal insignia\r\nof Scotland. The tressure is held in great honor in Scottish heraldry.\r\n\r\n=Trestles.= A trestle is composed of a cap about 15 feet by 9 inches by\r\n9 inches, of four legs, of two upper and two lower traverses, and of\r\nfour braces. The cap is notched 18 inches from the end, to receive the\r\nlegs; the notch is 5 inches wide and 1 deep. The legs should be from 5\r\nto 6 inches square; a shoulder is made to tit the notch in the cap; the\r\nspread is quarter the height. The inclination in the other direction\r\nabout one-sixteenth. The leg is spiked, pinned, or bolted to the cap.\r\nThe lower traverse is 5 inches by 1¹⁄₂ inches, and is dovetailed into\r\nthe legs at about one-quarter their height from the ground. The upper\r\ntraverse, which is nailed on the outside of the legs and against the\r\ncap, is 6 inches wide and 1¹⁄₂ inches thick. The braces are 4 inches\r\nwide by 1¹⁄₂ inches thick, and are spiked to the cap and legs. When\r\ntrestles are to be placed on a soft bottom, a flat sill may be spiked\r\nunder the legs of each side.\r\n\r\n_Trestle Bridge._--When the water is less than 4 feet deep, the trestles\r\nmay be carried to their places by men wading in the stream; an abutment\r\nis formed as for an ordinary bridge; the trestles are placed with their\r\ncaps parallel to the abutment sill and about 13 feet apart. When the\r\nwater is too deep or too cold to allow this method to be pursued, the\r\nbridge may be constructed as follows:\r\n\r\nThe abutment sill being placed, the first trestle can usually be placed\r\nby hand; the balks are laid and covered with chesses to within 1 foot of\r\nthe trestle, a roller is laid on the bridge; on this are laid two beams,\r\nfrom 30 to 40 feet long and 6 or 7 inches square. The trestle is placed\r\nupright, with its cap resting on these beams, to which it is firmly\r\nlashed. The pontoniers bear down on the other ends of the beams, at the\r\nsame time pushing until the trestle is rolled out to the proper\r\ndistance; then they suddenly release the beams, dropping the trestle\r\ninto its place. The flooring balks are slid out on the two beams,\r\nadjusted, and covered with chesses.\r\n\r\nWhen a boat or raft can be procured, the trestles are placed with much\r\nless labor. The boat is brought alongside the last trestle placed; two\r\nbalks are laid from the bridge, resting on a saddle, or the outer\r\ngunwale of the boat; the side of the trestle-cap is laid on the balks,\r\nthe legs extending over the outer gunwale of the boat. The boat is\r\npushed off by means of the balks until it arrives at the proper position\r\nfor placing the trestle, which is then righted. If it has not good\r\nbearing on the bottom, it is hauled into the boat and the legs are cut\r\nto the proper length.\r\n\r\nThe bridge may be entirely built of round timber. The caps should be\r\nfrom 10 to 12 inches in diameter, the legs at least 6 inches, the balks\r\n7 or 8 inches, and faced on the lower side where they rest on the\r\ntrestles, so as to bring their upper surfaces on the same plane. The\r\ncovering may be of strong hurdles.\r\n\r\n=Treves=, or =Trier= (anc. _Augusta Trevirorum_). A town of Rhenish\r\nPrussia, on the right bank of the Moselle, 65 miles southwest from\r\nCoblentz. Treves derives its name from the _Treviri_, or _Treveri_\r\n(which see). Their capital, _Augusta Trevirorum_, became a Roman colony\r\nin the time of Augustus, and ultimately became the headquarters of the\r\nRoman commanders on the Rhine, and a frequent residence of the emperors.\r\nUnder the Franks, into whose hands it fell in 463, it continued to\r\nflourish. In 843 it passed to Lorraine; in 870 to Germany; in 895 back\r\nto Lorraine, and finally was united to Germany by the emperor Henry I.\r\nSince 1814, Treves has belonged to Prussia.\r\n\r\n=Treviri=, or =Treveri=. A powerful people in Gallia Belgica, who were\r\nfaithful allies of the Romans, and whose cavalry was the best in all\r\nGaul.\r\n\r\n=Treviso.= A fortified town of Italy, in Venice, 17 miles northwest from\r\nVenice. Treviso, the ancient _Trevisium_, was a free town under the\r\nRomans; and after the fall of the empire was conquered in turn by the\r\nHuns, Ostrogoths, and Lombards. Thereafter it was for a time\r\nindependent, and at length, in 1344, voluntarily submitted itself to the\r\nrepublic of Venice.\r\n\r\n=Tria Juncta in Uno= (three joined in one). The motto of the knights of\r\nthe military order of the Bath, signifying “faith, hope, and charity.”\r\n\r\n=Trial.= The formal examination of the matter in issue in a cause before\r\na competent tribunal; the mode of determining a question of fact in a\r\ncourt of law; the examination, in legal form, of the facts in issue in a\r\ncause pending before a competent tribunal, for the purpose of\r\ndetermining such issue. Military trials shall be carried on only between\r\nthe hours of eight in the morning and three in the afternoon, except in\r\ncases which, in the opinion of the officer ordering the court, require\r\nimmediate example (Art. 94). No officer, non-commissioned officer, or\r\nsoldier shall be tried a second time for the same offense (Art. 102);\r\nand no person shall be liable to be tried and punished by a general\r\ncourt-martial for any offense which shall appear to have been committed\r\nmore than two years before the issuing of the order for such trial,\r\nunless the person, by reason of having absented himself, or some other\r\nmanifest impediment, shall not have been amenable to justice within that\r\nperiod (Art. 103). All trials before courts-martial, like those in civil\r\ncourts, are conducted publicly; and in order that this publicity may in\r\nno case be attended with tumult or indecorum of any kind, the court is\r\nauthorized, by the Rules and Articles of War, to punish, at its\r\ndiscretion, all riotous and disorderly proceedings or menacing words,\r\nsigns, or gestures, used in its presence (Art. 86). The day and place of\r\nmeeting of a general court-martial having been published in orders, the\r\nofficers appointed as members, and parties and witnesses, must attend\r\naccordingly. The judge-advocate, at the opening, calls over the names of\r\nthe members, who arrange themselves on the right or left of the\r\npresident, according to rank. The members of the court having taken\r\ntheir seats and disposed of any preliminary matter, the prisoner,\r\nprosecutor, and witnesses are called into court. The prisoner is\r\nattended by a guard, or by an officer, as his rank or the nature of the\r\ncharge may dictate; but during the trial should be unfettered and free\r\nfrom any bonds or shackles, unless there be danger of escape or rescue.\r\nAccommodation is usually afforded at detached tables for the prosecutor\r\nand prisoner; also for any friend or legal adviser of the prisoner or\r\nprosecutor, whose assistance has been desired during the trial; but the\r\nprisoner only can address the court, it being an admitted maxim, that\r\ncounsel are not to interfere in the proceedings, or to offer the\r\nslightest remark, much less to plead or argue. The judge-advocate, by\r\ndirection of the president, first reads, in an audible voice, the order\r\nfor holding the court. He then calls over the names of the members,\r\ncommencing with the president, who is always the highest in rank. He\r\nthen demands of the prisoner whether he has any exception or cause of\r\nchallenge against any of the members present, and if he have, he is\r\nrequired to state his cause of challenge, confining his challenge to one\r\nmember at a time (Art. 88). After hearing the prisoner’s objections, the\r\npresident must order the court to be cleared, when the members will\r\ndeliberate on and determine the relevancy or validity of the objection;\r\nthe member challenged retiring during the discussion. When the prisoner\r\nand prosecutor decline to challenge any of the members, or where the\r\ncauses of challenge have been disallowed, the judge-advocate proceeds to\r\nadminister to the members of the court the oath prescribed by the 84th\r\nArticle of War. The oath is taken by each member holding up his right\r\nhand and repeating the words after the judge-advocate. After the oath\r\nhas been administered to all the members, the president administers to\r\nthe judge-advocate the particular oath of secrecy to be observed by\r\nhim, as prescribed by the 85th Article of War. No sentence of a general\r\ncourt-martial is complete or final until it has been duly approved.\r\nUntil that period it is, strictly speaking, no more than an opinion,\r\nwhich is subject to alteration or revisal. In this interval, the\r\ncommunication of that opinion could answer no ends of justice, but\r\nmight, in many cases, tend to frustrate them. The obligation to\r\nperpetual secrecy, with regard to the votes or opinions of the\r\nparticular members of the court, is likewise founded on the\r\nwisest policy. The officers who compose a military tribunal are,\r\nin a great degree, dependent for their preferment on the President.\r\nThey are even, in some measure, under the influence of their\r\ncommander-in-chief,--considerations which might impair justice. This\r\ndanger is, therefore, best obviated by the confidence and security which\r\nevery member possesses, that his particular opinion is never to be\r\ndivulged. Another reason is, that the individual members of the court\r\nmay not be exposed to the resentment of parties and their connections,\r\nwhich can hardly fail to be excited by these sentences which\r\ncourts-martial are obliged to award. It may be necessary for officers,\r\nin the course of their duty, daily, to associate and frequently to be\r\nsent on the same command or service, with a person against whom they\r\nhave given an unfavorable vote or opinion on a court-martial. The\r\npublicity of these votes or opinions would create the most dangerous\r\nanimosities, equally fatal to the peace and security of individuals, and\r\nprejudicial to the public service. The court being regularly\r\nconstituted, and every preliminary form gone through, the\r\njudge-advocate, as prosecutor for the United States, desires the\r\nprisoner to listen to the charge or charges brought against him, which\r\nhe reads with an audible voice, and then the prisoner is asked whether\r\nhe is guilty or not guilty of the matter of accusation. The charge being\r\nsufficient, or not objected to, the prisoner must plead either: (1st)\r\nGuilty; or (2d) Specially to the jurisdiction, or in bar; or (3d) The\r\ngeneral plea of _not guilty_, which is the usual course where the\r\nprisoner makes a defense. If from obstinacy and design the prisoner\r\nstands mute, or answer foreign to the purpose, the court may proceed to\r\ntrial and judgment, as if the prisoner had regularly pleaded _not\r\nguilty_ (Art. 89); but if the prisoner plead _guilty_, the court will\r\nproceed to determine what punishment shall be awarded, and to pronounce\r\nsentence thereon. Preparatory to this, in all cases where the punishment\r\nof the offense charged is discretionary, and especially where the\r\ndiscretion includes a wide range and great variety of punishment, and\r\nthe specifications do not show all the circumstances attending the\r\noffense, the court should receive and report, in its proceedings, any\r\nevidence the judge-advocate may offer, for the purpose of illustrating\r\nthe actual character of the offense, notwithstanding the party accused\r\nmay have pleaded guilty; such evidence being necessary to an enlightened\r\nexercise of the discretion of the court, in measuring the punishment, as\r\nwell as for the approving authority. If there be any exception to this\r\nrule, it is where the specification is so full and precise as to\r\ndisclose all the circumstances of mitigation or aggravation which\r\naccompany the offense. When that is the case, or when the punishment is\r\nfixed, and no discretion is allowed, explanatory testimony cannot be\r\nneeded. Special pleas are either to the jurisdiction of the court or in\r\nbar of the charge. If an officer or soldier be arraigned by a court not\r\nlegally constituted, either as to the authority by which it is\r\nassembled, or as to the number and rank of its members, or other similar\r\ncauses, a prisoner may except to the jurisdiction of the court-martial.\r\nSpecial pleas in bar go to the merits of the case, and set forth a\r\nreason why, even admitting the charge to be true, it should be\r\ndismissed, and the prisoner discharged. A former acquittal or conviction\r\nof the same offense would obviously be a valid bar, except in case of\r\nappeal from a regimental to a general court-martial. Though the facts in\r\nissue should be charged to have happened more than two years prior to\r\nthe date of the order for the assembling of the court-martial, yet it is\r\nnot the province of the court, unless objection be made, to inquire into\r\nthe cause of the impediment in the outset. It would be to presume the\r\nillegality of the court, whereas the court should assume that manifest\r\nimpediment to earlier trial did exist, and leave the facts to be\r\ndeveloped by witnesses in the ordinary course. A pardon may be pleaded\r\nin bar. If full, it at once destroys the end and purpose of the charge,\r\nby remitting that punishment which the prosecution seeks to inflict; if\r\nconditional, the performance of the condition must be known; thus a\r\nsoldier arraigned for desertion, must plead a general pardon, and prove\r\nthat he surrendered himself within the stipulated period. No officer or\r\nsoldier, being acquitted or convicted of an offense, is liable to be\r\ntried a second time for the same. But this provision applies solely to\r\ntrials for the same incidental act and crime, and to such persons as\r\nhave, in the first instance, been legally tried. If any irregularity\r\ntake place on the trial rendering it illegal and void, the prisoner must\r\nbe discharged, and be regarded as standing in the same situation as\r\nbefore the commencement of these illegal proceedings. The same charge\r\nmay, therefore, be again preferred against the prisoner who cannot plead\r\nthe previous illegal trial in bar. A prisoner cannot plead in bar that\r\nhe has not been furnished with a copy of the charges, or that the copy\r\nfurnished him differed from that on which he had been arraigned. It is\r\ncustomary and proper to furnish him with a correct copy, but the\r\nomission shall not make void, though it may postpone the trial. If the\r\nspecial plea in bar be such that, if true, the charge should be\r\ndismissed and the prisoner discharged, the judge-advocate should be\r\ncalled on to answer it. If he does not admit it to be true, the prisoner\r\nmust produce evidence to the points alleged therein; and if, on\r\ndeliberation, the plea be found true, the facts being recorded, the\r\ncourt will adjourn and the president submit the proceedings to the\r\nofficer by whose order the court was convened, with a view to the\r\nimmediate discharge of the prisoner. The ordinary plea is _not guilty_,\r\nin which case the trial proceeds. The judge-advocate cautions all\r\nwitnesses on the trial to withdraw, and to return to court only on being\r\ncalled. He then proceeds to the examination of witnesses, and to the\r\nreading and proof of any written evidence he may have to bring forward.\r\nAfter a prisoner has been arraigned on specific charges, it is irregular\r\nfor a court-martial to admit any additional charge against him, even\r\nthough he may not have entered on his defense. The trial on the charges\r\nfirst preferred must be regularly concluded, when, if necessary, the\r\nprisoner may be tried on any further accusation brought against him. On\r\nthe trial of cases not capital, before courts-martial, the deposition of\r\nwitnesses not in the line or staff of the army may be taken before some\r\njustice of the peace, and read in evidence, provided the prosecutor and\r\nperson accused are present at the same, or are duly notified thereof.\r\nThe examination of witnesses is invariably in the presence of the court;\r\nbecause the countenance, looks, and gestures of a witness add to, or\r\ntake away from, the weight of his testimony. It is usually by\r\ninterrogation, sometimes by narration; in either case, the\r\njudge-advocate records the evidence, as nearly as possible, in the\r\nexpress words of the witness. All evidence, whatever, should be recorded\r\non the proceedings, in the order in which it is received by the court. A\r\nquestion to a witness is registered before enunciation; when once\r\nentered, it cannot be expunged, except by the consent of the parties\r\nbefore the court; if not permitted to be put to the witness, it still\r\nappears on the proceedings accompanied by the decision of the court. The\r\nexamination-in-chief of each particular witness being ended, the\r\ncross-examination usually follows, though it is optional with the\r\nprisoner to defer it to the final close of the examination-in-chief. The\r\nre-examination by the prosecutor, on such new points as the prisoner may\r\nhave made, succeeds the cross-examination, and finally, the court puts\r\nsuch questions as in its judgment may tend to elicit the truth. It is\r\ncustomary, when deemed necessary by the court, or desired by a witness,\r\nto read over to him, immediately before he leaves the court, the record\r\nof his evidence, which he is desired to correct if erroneous, and, with\r\nthis view, any remark or explanation is entered upon the proceedings. No\r\nerasure or obliteration is, however, admitted, as it is essentially\r\nnecessary that the authority which has to review the sentence should\r\nhave the most ample means of judging, not only of any discrepancy in the\r\nstatements of a witness, but of any incident which may be made the\r\nsubject of remark, by either party in addressing the court. Although a\r\nlist of witnesses, summoned by the judge-advocate, is furnished to the\r\ncourt on assembling, it is not held imperative on the prosecutor to\r\nexamine such witnesses; if he should not do so, however, the prisoner\r\nhas a right to call any of them. Should the prisoner, having closed his\r\ncross-examination, think proper subsequently to recall a prosecutor’s\r\nwitness in his defense, the examination is held to be in chief, and the\r\nwitness is subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor. Although\r\neither party may have concluded his case, or the regular examination of\r\na witness, yet should a material question have been omitted, it is\r\nusually submitted by the party to the president, for the consideration\r\nof the court, which generally permits it to be put. The prisoner being\r\nplaced on his defense, may proceed at once to the examination of\r\nwitnesses: firstly, to meet the charge; and, secondly, to speak as to\r\ncharacter, reserving his address to the court until the conclusion of\r\nsuch examination. The prisoner having finished the examination-in-chief\r\nof each witness, the prosecution cross-examines; the prisoner\r\nre-examines to the extent allowed to the prosecutor, that is, on such\r\nnew points as the cross-examination may have touched on, and the court\r\nputs any questions deemed necessary. The prisoner having finally closed\r\nhis examination of witnesses, and selecting this period to address the\r\ncourt, offers such statement or argument as he may deem conducive to\r\nweaken the force of the prosecution, by placing his conduct in the most\r\nfavorable light, accounting for or palliating facts, confuting or\r\nremoving any imputation as to motives; answering the arguments of the\r\nprosecutor, contrasting, comparing, and commenting on any contradictory\r\nevidence; summing up the evidence on both sides where the result\r\npromises to favor the defense, and finally, presenting his deductions\r\ntherefrom. The utmost liberty consistent with the interest of parties\r\nnot before the court and with the respect due to the court itself\r\nshould, at all times, be allowed a prisoner. As he has an undoubted\r\nright to impeach, by evidence, the character of the witnesses brought\r\nagainst him, so he is justified in contrasting and remarking on their\r\ntestimony, and on the motives by which they, or the prosecutor, may have\r\nbeen influenced. All coarse and insulting language is, however, to be\r\navoided, nor ought invective to be indulged in, as the most pointed\r\nevidence may be couched in the most decorous language. The court will\r\nprevent the prisoner from adverting to parties not before the court, or\r\nonly alluded to in evidence, further than may be actually necessary to\r\nhis own exculpation. It may sometimes happen that the party accused may\r\nfind it absolutely necessary, in defense of himself, to throw blame and\r\neven criminality on others, who are no parties to the trial; nor can a\r\nprisoner be refused that liberty, which is essential to his own\r\njustification. It is sufficient for the party aggrieved that the law can\r\nfurnish ample redress against all calumnious or unjust accusations. The\r\ncourt is bound to hear whatever address, in his defense, the accused may\r\nthink fit to offer, not being in itself contemptuous or disrespectful.\r\nIt is competent to a court, if it think proper, to caution the prisoner\r\nas he proceeds, that, in its opinion, such a line of defense as he may\r\nbe pursuing would probably not weigh with the court, nor operate in his\r\nfavor; but, to decide against hearing him state arguments, which,\r\nnotwithstanding such caution, he might persist in putting forward, as\r\ngrounds of justification, or extenuation (such arguments not being\r\nillegal in themselves), is going beyond what any court would be\r\nwarranted in doing. It occasionally happens that, on presenting to the\r\ncourt a written address, the prisoner is unequal to the task of reading\r\nit, from indisposition or nervous excitement; on such occasions, the\r\njudge-advocate is sometimes requested by the president to read it; but,\r\nas the impression which might be anticipated to be made by it may, in\r\nthe judgment of the prisoner, be effected more or less by the manner of\r\nits delivery, courts-martial generally feel disposed to concede to the\r\naccused the indulgence of permitting it to be read by any friend named\r\nby him, particularly if that friend be a military man, or if the\r\njudge-advocate be the actual prosecutor. Courts-martial are particularly\r\nguarded in adhering to the custom of resisting every attempt on the part\r\nof counsel to address them. A lawyer is not recognized by a\r\ncourt-martial, though his presence is tolerated, as a friend of the\r\nprisoner, to assist him by advice in preparing questions for witnesses,\r\nin taking notes and shaping his defense. The prisoner having closed his\r\ndefense, the prosecutor is entitled to reply, when witnesses have been\r\nexamined on the defense, or where new facts are opened in the address.\r\nThus, though no evidence may be brought forward by the prisoner, yet\r\nshould he advert to any case, and, by drawing a parallel, attempt to\r\ndraw his justification from it, the prosecutor will be permitted to\r\nobserve on the case so cited. When the court allows the prosecutor to\r\nreply, it generally grants him a reasonable time to prepare it; and,\r\nupon his reading it, the trial ceases. Should the prisoner have examined\r\nwitnesses to points not touched on in the prosecution, or should he have\r\nentered on an examination impeaching the credibility of the prosecutor’s\r\nevidence, the prosecutor is allowed to examine witnesses to the new\r\nmatter; the court being careful to confine him within the limits of this\r\nrule, which extends to the re-establishing the character of his\r\nwitnesses, to impeaching those of the defense, and to rebutting the new\r\nmatter brought forward by the prisoner, supported by evidence. He cannot\r\nbe allowed to examine on any points which, in their nature, he might\r\nhave foreseen previously to the defense of the prisoner. The prosecutor\r\nwill not be permitted to bring forward evidence to rebut or counteract\r\nthe effect of matter elicited by his own cross-examination; but is\r\nstrictly confined to new matter introduced by the prisoner, and\r\nsupported by his examination-in-chief. A defense resting on motives, or\r\nqualifying the imputation attaching to facts, generally lets in evidence\r\nin reply; as, in such cases, the prisoner usually adverts, by evidence,\r\nto matter which it would have been impossible for the prosecutor to\r\nanticipate. The admissibility of evidence, in reply, may generally be\r\ndetermined by the answer to the questions: Could the prosecutor have\r\nforeseen this? Is it evidently new matter? Is the object of the further\r\ninquiry to re-establish the character of the witnesses impeached by\r\nevidence (not by declamation) in the course of the defense, or is it to\r\nimpeach the character of the prisoner’s witnesses? Cross-examination of\r\nsuch new witnesses, to an extent limited by the examination-in-chief,\r\nthat is, confined to such points or matter as the prosecutor shall have\r\nexamined on, is allowed on the part of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n=Triangles.= A wooden instrument consisting of three poles so fastened\r\nat the top that they may spread at bottom in a triangular form, and by\r\nmeans of spikes affixed to each pole, remain firm in the earth. An iron\r\nbar, breast-high, goes across one side of the triangle. The triangles\r\nwere used in some regiments for the purpose of inflicting military\r\npunishment when corporeal chastisement was much in vogue.\r\n\r\n=Triarii.= In the Roman legions, consisted of veteran soldiers, who\r\nformed the third line in the order of battle.\r\n\r\n=Triballi.= A powerful people in Thrace, a branch of the Getæ dwelling\r\nalong the Danube, who were defeated by Alexander the Great in 335 B.C.,\r\nand obliged to sue for peace.\r\n\r\n=Tribune.= In Roman antiquity, an officer or magistrate chosen by the\r\npeople, to protect them from the oppression of the patricians or nobles,\r\nand to defend their liberties against any attempts that might be made\r\nupon them by the senate and consuls. The tribunes were at first two, but\r\ntheir number was increased ultimately to ten. There were also military\r\ntribunes, officers of the army, of whom there were from four to six in\r\neach legion.\r\n\r\n=Tribute.= An annual or stated sum of money or other valuable thing,\r\npaid by one prince or nation to another, either as an acknowledgment of\r\nsubmission, or as the price of peace and protection, or by virtue of\r\nsome treaty; as the Romans made their conquered countries pay tribute.\r\n\r\n=Trichinopoly.= Capital of the district of the same name, of British\r\nIndia; in the presidency of Madras. It is pretty strongly fortified by\r\nwalls about 2 miles in circuit, lofty, thick, and in some places double.\r\nThere is also a fort built on a sienite rock about 600 feet high. Two or\r\n3 miles southwest of the town is a large cantonment, containing barracks\r\nfor a large number of troops. Trichinopoly was subject to a Hindoo rajah\r\nuntil 1732, when the nabob of Arcot gained possession of it; and in 1741\r\nhe was in turn dispossessed by the Mahrattas. During the wars between\r\nthe French and English, the place was much contested; and in 1757, when\r\nbesieged by the former, it was relieved by the rapid march of an English\r\nforce under Capt. Calliaud.\r\n\r\n=Trick.= A term used in heraldry to denote a mode of representing arms\r\nby sketching them in outline, and appending letters to express the\r\ntinctures, and sometimes numerals to indicate the repetition of changes.\r\n\r\n=Trident.= In Roman antiquity, a three-pronged spear used in the\r\ncontests of gladiators by the retiarius.\r\n\r\n=Triest=, or =Trieste= (anc. _Tergeste_, or _Tergestum_). The principal\r\nseaport city of the Austrian empire, in Illyria, on the Gulf of Triest\r\nat the northeast extremity of the Adriatic Sea, 73 miles east-northeast\r\nof Venice. The ancient _Tergeste_ first received historical mention in\r\n51 B.C., when it was overrun and plundered by neighboring tribes. It\r\nowes its prosperity chiefly to the emperor Charles VI., who constituted\r\nit a free port, and to Maria Theresa. In 1797 and in 1805, it was taken\r\nby the French.\r\n\r\n=Trigger.= A steel catch, which being pulled disengages the\r\ncock of a gunlock, and causes the hammer to strike the nipple in\r\npercussion-muskets, and the firing-pin in breech-loaders. The difference\r\nbetween a hair and common trigger is this: the hair-trigger, when set,\r\nlets off the cock at the slightest touch, whereas the common trigger\r\nrequires a greater degree of force, and consequently its operation is\r\nretarded.\r\n\r\n=Trim.= The chief town of the county of Meath, Ireland, on the Boyne, 27\r\nmiles northwest from Dublin. It was taken by Cromwell in 1649.\r\n\r\n=Trincomalee.= A seaport town and magnificent harbor on the northeast\r\ncoast of Ceylon. It is a place of great antiquity; it was here that the\r\nMalabar invaders of Ceylon built one of their most sacred shrines,--the\r\n“Temple of a Thousand Columns,” which was demolished by the Portuguese,\r\nwho fortified the heights with the materials derived from its\r\ndestruction, 1622. It was next held by the Dutch; but in 1672, during\r\nthe rupture between Louis XIV. and the United Provinces, the French took\r\nTrincomalee, which was abandoned by the Dutch in a panic. In 1782, the\r\nFrench admiral Suffrein, in the absence of the British commander, took\r\npossession of the fort, and the English garrison retired to Madras. It\r\nwas restored to the Dutch in the following year, and they retained it\r\ntill the capture of Ceylon by the British in 1795. It was finally ceded\r\nto Great Britain, by the treaty of Amiens, in 1802.\r\n\r\n=Trinidad.= An island belonging to Great Britain, and the most southerly\r\nof the West India Islands. It is separated from the mainland (Venezuela)\r\nby the Gulf of Paria. Trinidad was discovered by Columbus in 1498; and\r\nfirst colonized by the Spaniards, in 1588. In 1676, the French possessed\r\nit for a short time, but it was speedily restored to Spain; and in 1797,\r\nit was captured by the British, who have retained it ever since.\r\n\r\n=Trinobantes.= A British tribe, which occupied Middlesex and Essex, and\r\njoined in opposing the invasion of Julius Cæsar, 54 B.C.; but they soon\r\ncame to terms with the Romans.\r\n\r\n=Trinomalee.= A town and fortress of India, in the Carnatic, where Col.\r\nSmith greatly distinguished himself against the united forces of Hyder\r\nAli and Nizam Ali, subahdars of the Deccan, with an army of 43,000 horse\r\nand 28,000 foot; while the British commander had only 10,000 foot and\r\n1000 horse. The result of this victory was that the Nizam detached\r\nhimself from Hyder, and in February, 1768, concluded a treaty with the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\n=Triparted.= In heraldry, parted in three pieces; having three parts or\r\npieces; as, a cross triparted.\r\n\r\n=Tripartite.= Being of three parts, or three parties being concerned;\r\nhence, tripartite alliance, or treaty.\r\n\r\n=Triple Alliance.= The name by which two different treaties are known in\r\nhistory, viz.: (1) A treaty concluded in 1668 at the Hague, between\r\nEngland, Holland, and Sweden, having for its object the protection of\r\nthe Spanish Netherlands, and the checking of the conquests of Louis XIV.\r\n(2) An alliance concluded in 1717 between Britain, France, and Holland,\r\nagainst Spain, which included among its stipulations that the Pretender\r\nshould quit France, and that the treaty of Utrecht should be carried\r\ninto effect as regards the demolition of Dunkirk. The Protestant\r\nsuccession was guaranteed by this treaty in England, and that of the\r\nDuke of Orleans in France.\r\n\r\n=Tripoli=, or =Tripolis= (in its modern Arabic form, _Tarabulus_). A\r\nseaport and one of the chief commercial towns of Syria, near the coast\r\nof the Mediterranean, on both sides of the river Kadisha. On the left\r\nside stands the castle built by Count Raymond of Toulouse, in the 12th\r\ncentury, when the city was taken by the Crusaders. It was conquered by\r\nthe Egyptians in 1832; restored to the Porte, 1835, and it surrendered\r\nto the British in 1841.\r\n\r\n=Tripoli.= A regency of the Ottoman empire, and the most easterly of the\r\nBarbary States, North Africa. The governor-general has the title, rank,\r\nand authority of a pasha of the Ottoman empire. The military force of\r\nthe country consists of a body of Turkish soldiers, some 10,000 in\r\nnumber, whose business is to keep down insurrections, but who were\r\nformerly wont to vary it by creating them. In ancient times, Tripoli\r\nseems to have been tributary to the Cyrenæans, from whom, however, it\r\nwas wrested by the Carthaginians. It next passed to the Romans. Like the\r\nrest of Northern Africa, it was conquered by the Arabs, and the feeble\r\nChristianity of the natives was supplanted by a vigorous and fanatical\r\nMohammedanism. In 1552 (1551), the Turks got possession of it, and have\r\never since been the rulers of the country, though the authority of the\r\nsultan, up till 1835, had been virtually at zero for more than a\r\ncentury. In that year, however, an expedition was dispatched from\r\nConstantinople; the ruling dey, Karamanli, was overthrown and\r\nimprisoned; a new Turkish pasha, with viceregal powers, was appointed,\r\nand the state made an eyalet of the Ottoman empire. Several rebellions\r\nhave since taken place (notably in 1842 and 1844), but they have always\r\nbeen suppressed.\r\n\r\n=Tripolitza= (“three cities”). A town of Greece under the Turkish rule,\r\n39 miles southwest from Corinth. In 1821 it was stormed by the Greek\r\ninsurgents; and in 1828 razed to the ground by the troops of Ibrahim\r\nPasha; it has since, however, been rebuilt.\r\n\r\n=Tripping.= In heraldry, having the right fore foot lifted, the others\r\nremaining on the ground, as if he were trotting;--said of an animal, as\r\na hart, buck, and the like, represented in an escutcheon.\r\n\r\n=Triumph= (Lat. _triumphus_). Was the name given in ancient Rome to the\r\npublic honor bestowed on a general who had been successful in war. It\r\nconsisted in a solemn procession along the _Via Sacra_ up to the\r\nCapitol, where sacrifice was offered Jupiter. The victor sat in a\r\nchariot, drawn by four horses,--his captives marching before, his troops\r\nfollowing behind. Certain conditions had to be fulfilled before a\r\ntriumph could be enjoyed, and it was the business of the senate to see\r\nthat these were enforced. Under the empire, generals serving abroad were\r\nconsidered to be the emperor’s lieutenants, and therefore, however\r\nsuccessful in their wars, they had no claim to a triumph. They received\r\ninstead _triumphal decorations_, and other rewards. The oration, or\r\nlesser triumph, differs from the greater chiefly in these respects; that\r\nthe imperator entered the city on foot, clad in the simple _toga\r\nprætexta_ of a magistrate, that he bore no sceptre, was not preceded by\r\nthe senate and a flourish of trumpets, nor followed by victorious\r\ntroops, but only by the equites and the populace, and that the\r\nceremonies were concluded by the sacrifice of a sheep instead of a bull.\r\nThe _ovation_, it is scarcely necessary to add, was granted when the\r\nsuccess, though considerable, did not fulfill the conditions specified\r\nfor a triumph.\r\n\r\n=Triumph.= To obtain victory; to meet with success.\r\n\r\n=Triumphal.= Of or pertaining to triumph; used in triumph; indicating,\r\nor in honor of, a triumph or victory; as, a triumphal crown; a triumphal\r\narch.\r\n\r\n=Triumphal Column.= See COLUMN, TRIUMPHAL.\r\n\r\n=Triumphal Crown.= See CROWN, TRIUMPHAL.\r\n\r\n=Triumphant.= Celebrating victory; expressive of joy for success; as, a\r\ntriumphant song.\r\n\r\n=Triumpher.= One who was honored with a triumph in ancient Rome. One who\r\ntriumphs or rejoices for victory; one who vanquishes.\r\n\r\n=Trojæ Ludus.= Among the Romans was a species of mock fight, similar to\r\nthe tournaments of the Middle Ages, performed by young noblemen on\r\nhorseback, who were furnished with arms suitable to their age.\r\n\r\n=Trojan War.= In classical history, a celebrated epoch, which occurred\r\nnearly thirteen centuries before the Christian era, and which has formed\r\nthe subject of the two finest poems in the world,--Homer’s “Iliad” and\r\nVirgil’s “Æneid.” This war was undertaken by the states of Greece to\r\nrecover Helen, whom Paris, the son of Priam, king of Troy, had carried\r\naway from the house of Menelaus. (See TROY.)\r\n\r\n=Tromblon.= A fire-arm which was formerly fired from a rest, and from\r\nwhich several balls and slugs were discharged. An ancient wall-piece.\r\n\r\n=Trombone.= Formerly a species of blunderbuss for boat-service, taking\r\nits name from its unseemly trumpet mouth.\r\n\r\n=Troop.= A company of cavalry. It is the same, with respect to\r\nformation, as a company in the infantry.\r\n\r\n=Troop Corporal-Major.= The chief non-commissioned officer of a troop in\r\nthe British Household Cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Troop Sergeant-Major.= In the British service, is the chief sergeant of\r\na troop.\r\n\r\n=Trooper.= A private or soldier in a body of cavalry; a horse-soldier.\r\n\r\n=Trooping the Colors.= Is a ceremony performed in the British service,\r\nat the public mounting of garrison guards.\r\n\r\n=Troop-ship.= A merchant ship “taken up,” as it is called, for the\r\nconveyance of soldiers by sea.\r\n\r\n=Trophy.= Was a memorial of victory erected on the spot where the enemy\r\nhad turned to flight. Among the Greeks (with the exception of the\r\nMacedonians, who erected no trophies) one or two shields and helmets of\r\nthe routed enemy placed upon the trunk of a tree served as the sign and\r\nmemorial of victory. After a sea-fight the trophy consisted of the beaks\r\nand stern-ornaments of the captured vessels, set up on the nearest\r\ncoast. It was considered wrong to destroy such a trophy, and equally\r\nwrong to repair it when it had fallen down through time, for animosity\r\nought not to be perpetual. In early times the Romans never erected\r\ntrophies on the field, but decorated the buildings at Rome with the\r\nspoils of the vanquished. In later times pillars and triumphal arches\r\nwere employed to commemorate victories. Besides these, in modern times,\r\nthe humiliation of an enemy is rendered lasting by such devices as the\r\nbridge of Jena, of Waterloo, and by the distribution of captured cannon.\r\nMorally considered, this practice is no improvement upon the simple and\r\nperishable trophies of the ancient Greeks.\r\n\r\n=Trophy-money.= Was certain money formerly raised in the several\r\ncounties of the kingdom of Great Britain, towards providing harness and\r\nmaintaining the militia.\r\n\r\n=Trossulum= (now _Trusso_). A town in Etruria, 9 miles from Volsinii,\r\nwhich is said to have been taken by some Roman equites without the aid\r\nof foot-soldiers; whence the Roman equites obtained the name of\r\nTrossuli. Some writers identify this town with Troilium, which was taken\r\nby the Romans 293 B.C.; but they appear to have been different places.\r\n\r\n=Trou de Loup= (Wolf-hole). In field fortification, is a round hole,\r\nabout 6 feet deep, and pointed at the bottom, like an inverted cone,\r\nwith a stake placed in the middle. _Trous de loup_ are frequently dug\r\nround a redoubt to obstruct the enemy’s approach. They are circular at\r\nthe top, of about 4¹⁄₂ feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n=Trou de Rat= (_Fr._). Literally, a rat-hole, or rat-catch;\r\nfiguratively, any disadvantageous position into which troops are rashly\r\ndriven.\r\n\r\n=Trowel Bayonet.= So called from its shape. A bayonet intended to serve\r\nalso as an intrenching tool; invented by Lieut. Rice, 5th U. S.\r\nInfantry. It is used by part of the U. S. troops at the present time\r\n(1880).\r\n\r\n=Troy.= The earliest traditions of the Greek people represent the\r\ncountry on both sides of the Ægean as peopled by various races, either\r\nof genuine Hellenic, or of closely affiliated tribes. Among those who\r\npeopled the eastern Asiatic coast were the Trojans. The story of the\r\nTrojan war is extremely simple. The Trojans, in the person of Paris, or\r\nAlexander, the son of the reigning monarch, Priam, are represented as\r\nhaving had certain dealings with the Achæans, or Greeks of the\r\nPeloponnesus, in the course of which the gay young prince carries off\r\nfrom the palace of Menelaus, king of Sparta, his spouse Helen, the\r\ngreatest beauty of her age. To revenge this insult, the Greeks banded\r\nthemselves together and sailed against Troy with a large fleet. The most\r\nnotable of the tribes who took part in this expedition were the Argives,\r\nor Achæans, the Spartans, the Bœotians, and the Thessalians. Of the\r\nThessalians, the most prominent captain was Achilles; and the general\r\ncommand of the whole expedition was committed to Agamemnon, king of\r\nMycenæ. This well-appointed European army is represented as having spent\r\nnine years in besieging the god-built walls of the city of Priam\r\nwithout making any impression on its strength. A violent quarrel between\r\nAchilles and Agamemnon, breaking out in the tenth year, so weakened the\r\ninvading force that the Trojans, under Hector, pushed the Greeks back to\r\nthe very verge of the sea, and almost set their ships on fire. At the\r\ncritical moment, however, the Thessalian captain was reconciled to the\r\nhead of the expedition; and with his return to the field the fortune of\r\nwar changed; Hector, the champion of Troy, fell, and the impending doom\r\nof the city was darkly foreshadowed; it was finally captured and sacked,\r\n1184 B.C. (the date generally accepted).\r\n\r\n=Troyes.= A town of France, capital of the department of Aube, on the\r\nleft bank of the Seine. It occupies the site of the ancient Augustobono,\r\nthe chief town of the Tricasses. It suffered severely in the civil wars\r\nof the 15th century, and was taken by Joan of Arc in 1429. A treaty was\r\nconcluded here between England, France, and Burgundy, May 21, 1420,\r\nwhereby it was stipulated that Henry V. should marry Catherine, daughter\r\nof Charles VI., be appointed regent of France, and after the death of\r\nCharles should inherit the crown. Troyes was taken by the allied armies\r\nFebruary 7; retaken by Napoleon February 23; and again taken by the\r\nallies March 4, 1814.\r\n\r\n=Truce.= An agreement between belligerent parties, by which they\r\nmutually engage to forbear all acts of hostility against each other for\r\nsome time, the war still continuing. Truces are of several kinds:\r\n_general_, extending to all the territories and dominions of both\r\nparties; and _particularly_, restrained to particular places; as, for\r\nexample, by sea, and not by land. They are also _absolute_,\r\n_indeterminate_, and _general_; or _limited and determined_ to certain\r\nthings, for example, to bury the dead. During a truce, it is\r\ndishonorable to occupy more advanced ground, or to resort to any act\r\nwhich would confer advantage. A truce requires ordinarily to be\r\nconfirmed by the commander-in-chief to become binding. It is lawful to\r\nbreak it before the prescribed period, on notice previously agreed on\r\nbeing given to the opposite party. This is called denouncing a truce.\r\n\r\n=Truce, Flag of.= See FLAG OF TRUCE.\r\n\r\n=Truce of God.= A suspension of arms, which occasionally took place in\r\nthe Middle Ages, putting a stop to private hostilities, at or within\r\ncertain periods.\r\n\r\n=Truck.= Wooden-wheels for the carriage of cannon, etc. The trucks of\r\ngarrison-carriages are generally made of cast iron. Trucks of a\r\nship-carriage are wheels made of one piece of wood, from 12 to 19 inches\r\nin diameter, and their thickness is always equal to the caliber of the\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n=Truck, Casemate.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Trumpet=, or =Trump=. A wind instrument, made of brass or silver, used\r\nin the cavalry and mounted artillery.\r\n\r\n=Trumpet-call.= A call by the sound of the trumpet.\r\n\r\n=Trumpeter.= A soldier whose duty it is to sound the trumpet.\r\n\r\n=Trumpet-Major.= The non-commissioned officer in charge of the\r\ntrumpeters of a regiment of cavalry.\r\n\r\n=Truncheon.= A club; a cudgel; also, a staff of command. The truncheon\r\nwas for several ages the sign of office. Generals were presented with\r\nthe truncheon as the sign of investiture with command; and all those\r\nofficers who belonged to the suite of the general, and were not attached\r\nto regiments, carried a truncheon, or staff, whence the name of officers\r\nof the staff.\r\n\r\n=Trunnion-gauge.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Trunnion-plate.= In gunnery, is a plate in the carriage of a gun,\r\nmortar, or howitzer, which covers the upper part of the cheek, and goes\r\nunder the trunnion.\r\n\r\n=Trunnions.= In gunnery, are two cylinders at or near the centre of\r\ngravity of a gun, by which it is supported on its carriage. The axes are\r\nin a line perpendicular to the axis of the bore, and, in our guns, in\r\nthe same plane with that axis. By means of the trunnions the piece is\r\nattached to its carriage; and by being placed at or near the centre of\r\ngravity, it is easily elevated or depressed.\r\n\r\n=Trunnion-square.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Truxillo.= A town of the republic of Venezuela, capital of a province\r\nof the same name. Though now a poor, mean place, it is said to have\r\nbeen, previously to 1678, when it was pillaged by the buccaneer\r\nGrammont, one of the finest and wealthiest cities of America.\r\n\r\n=Tubantes.= A people of Germany, allies of the Cherusci, originally\r\ndwelt between the Rhine and the Yssel. They are subsequently mentioned\r\nas a part of the great league of the Franci.\r\n\r\n=Tube-pouch.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Tuberated.= In heraldry, knotted or swelled out.\r\n\r\n=Tuck.= A long, narrow sword.\r\n\r\n=Tudela= (anc. _Tutella_). A city of Spain, province of Navarre, on the\r\nright bank of the Ebro, 52 miles northwest from Saragossa. Here the\r\nFrench under Marshal Lannes totally defeated the Spaniards, on November\r\n23, 1808.\r\n\r\n=Tugenbund= (“League of Virtue”). This league was formed in Prussia soon\r\nafter the peace of Tilsit, June, 1807, for relieving the sufferers by\r\nthe late wars, and for the revival of morality and patriotism, gradually\r\nbecame a formidable secret political society, opposed to the French\r\npredominance in Germany. It excited the jealousy of Napoleon, who\r\ndemanded its suppression in 1809. It was dissolved at the peace in 1815.\r\n\r\n=Tuileries, Palace and Gardens of the.= Are situated in the middle of\r\nParis, on the right bank of the Seine. In 1793, the National Convention\r\nheld its sittings in the Tuileries; and when Bonaparte became First\r\nConsul, he chose it for his official residence. It was the imperial\r\nresidence of Napoleon III.; but was burned down by the Commune in 1871.\r\n\r\n=Tulwar.= In the East Indies means a sword.\r\n\r\n=Tumbril.= A covered cart on two wheels, for the carriage of ammunition,\r\ntools, etc., belonging to the artillery. The name obtained a melancholy\r\ncelebrity from being applied to the carts which served to carry the\r\nunfortunate victims of the French revolution to the guillotine.\r\n\r\n=Tunic.= A close-fitting coat, with short sleeves, worn in ancient times\r\nby the Romans. This sort of clothing was prevalent among the French\r\nafter their return from the Crusades to the Holy Land. They adopted it\r\nfrom the Saracens, and seemed ambitious of appearing in a garb which\r\nbore testimony to their feats of valor. These tunics, which were\r\nconverted into a sort of uniform, obtained the name of _saladines_ among\r\nthe French, in compliment to the emperor Saladin.\r\n\r\n=Tunis.= One of the Barbary States forming a considerable territory or\r\nregency of the Ottoman empire, in Northern Africa. Its history is nearly\r\nidentical with the city of the same name (which see).\r\n\r\n=Tunis.= A fortified city of Africa, and the capital of the country of\r\nthat name, at the mouth of the Mejerdah, 400 miles east by north from\r\nAlgiers. Tunis is situated about 3 miles to the southwest of the ruins\r\nof ancient Carthage, and it is itself a place of great antiquity. During\r\nthe Punic wars it was repeatedly taken and retaken. In 439 it fell into\r\nthe hands of the Vandals, but having been wrested from them about a\r\ncentury thereafter by Belisarius, it continued to be subject to the\r\nGreek empire till the end of the 7th century, when Northern Africa was\r\noverrun by the victorious armies of the Saracens and became a dependency\r\nof the caliphs of Bagdad. In 1286 Tunis became an absolute sovereignty\r\nunder Aboo-Ferez, who soon added the greater part of Algiers and\r\nTripoli. About this time it became notorious for its piracies, and in\r\n1270, Louis IX. of France, in a chivalrous attempt to suppress them,\r\nlost both his army and his life. It remained under African kings till\r\ntaken by Barbarossa, for Solyman the Magnificent. It was taken with\r\ngreat slaughter, and Barbarossa expelled, by the emperor Charles V.,\r\nwhen 10,000 Christian slaves were set at liberty, 1535. The country was\r\nsubjugated by the Turks (1574), who at first governed it by a Turkish\r\npasha and divan, with a body of Janissaries sent from Constantinople,\r\nbut were ultimately obliged to allow the Moors to elect their own bey,\r\nonly reserving to themselves the power of confirming the election and\r\nexacting a tribute. The piracies of the Tunisians subjected them to\r\nsevere chastisement, first from the British under Admiral Blake, who\r\nreduced it, on the bey refusing to deliver up the British captives,\r\n1655; and afterwards from France and Holland. During the 18th century it\r\nbecame tributary to Algiers. About the beginning of the 19th century,\r\nHamuda Pasha threw off the Algerian yoke, subdued the Turkish militia,\r\nand created a native Tunisian army; in consequence of which Tunis\r\nvirtually attained independence. An insurrection broke out April\r\n18,1864, and in May, the European powers sent ships of war to protect\r\ntheir subjects.\r\n\r\n=Turin.= A large city of Italy, capital of Piedmont, at the confluence\r\nof the Dora-Susina with the Po, 79 miles west-southwest from Milan. The\r\nfoundation of Turin is generally attributed to a colony of Transalpine\r\norigin called Taurini, or Taurisci. Shortly after Hannibal crossed the\r\nAlps, he made himself master of the territory in which it is situated;\r\nbut after his expulsion from Italy, the Romans resumed possession and\r\nconverted Turin into a colony, which took the name of _Colonia Julia_.\r\nThis name was afterwards changed into that of _Augusta Taurinorum_. It\r\nwas taken and sacked by the Goths under Alaric. To ward off similar\r\ndisasters, it was shortly after surrounded by walls, but did not escape\r\nthe ravages of the Longobards. Charlemagne, into whose hands it\r\nsubsequently passed, bestowed it as feudal tenure on its bishops. In\r\n1418 (1416) it was declared by Amadeo V. the capital of the states of\r\nSavoy, and ultimately rose to be the capital of the whole Sardinian\r\nstates. The French besieged this city; but Prince Eugène defeated their\r\narmy, and compelled them to raise the siege, September 7, 1706. In 1798,\r\nthe French republican army took possession of Turin, seized all the\r\nstrong places and arsenals of Piedmont, and obliged the king and his\r\nfamily to remove to the island of Sardinia. In 1799 the French were\r\ndriven out by the Austrians and Russians; but shortly afterwards the\r\ncity and all Piedmont surrendered to the French. In 1814, it was\r\ndelivered up to the allies, who restored it to the king of Sardinia.\r\n\r\n=Turkey.= Or the Ottoman empire, called by the Turks _Osmanli Vilayeti_,\r\nincludes large portions of the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa,\r\nand consists of Turkey Proper, which is under the direct rule of the\r\nsultan, and of numerous dependent and tributary states, governed by\r\ntheir own princes. The existing Turkish empire dates only from the end\r\nof the 13th century, when it was founded by Osman, or Othman, a Turk of\r\nnoble family, who had been driven westward from Khorasan by the invasion\r\nof Genghis Khan. Osman first invaded the Greek territory of Nicomedia on\r\nJuly 27, 1299; but the true era of the empire may be dated from the\r\nconquest of the city of Prusa, the capital of Bithynia, which\r\nsurrendered to his son Orchan in 1326. Murad I. (Amurath) subdued,\r\nwithout resistance, the whole of Thrace from the Hellespont to Mount\r\nHæmus, and made Adrianople the seat of vice-royalty. Murad was succeeded\r\nby his son Bajazet (Byazid), whose reign forms one of the most splendid\r\nepochs in the Turkish annals. His armies were victorious in every\r\ncountry that he undertook to conquer, until at last he encountered the\r\nfamous Mogul chief, Tamerlane, who defeated the Turkish army and took\r\nBajazet captive. After the death of Tamerlane, Solyman, the son of\r\nBajazet, obtained the European dominions of his father and eventually\r\nassumed the title of sultan. At his death in 1421 he bequeathed an\r\nundivided empire to his successor, Amurath II., in whose reign the\r\nTurkish empire rose in splendor and opulence. He enlarged the empire by\r\nconquests, and was succeeded in 1451 by Mohammed II., the conqueror of\r\nConstantinople. Mohammed laid siege to Belgrade, three years after the\r\ntaking of Constantinople, from which, after an obstinate resistance, he\r\nwas at length repulsed with the loss of his large ordnance and 40,000 of\r\nhis best troops. Abandoning his attempts upon Hungary, the sultan\r\nundertook an expedition into Greece, and about 1460 succeeded in\r\nsubduing the whole of the Morea. Mohammed continued to overrun Europe\r\nwith his victorious armies, until death stopped his triumphant career in\r\n1481. A series of domestic broils continued to take place until Selim\r\nascended the throne in 1512. He was a successful prince, and during his\r\nshort reign conquered Egypt, Aleppo, Antioch, Tripoli, Damascus, and\r\nGaza, and defeated the Persians. On the death of Selim, Solyman the\r\nMagnificent ascended the Ottoman throne, and like several of the\r\npreceding monarchs he continued to humiliate his enemies and add new\r\nterritory to his dominions. His dominions extended from Algiers to the\r\nriver Euphrates, and from the farther end of the Black Sea to the\r\nextremity of Greece and Epirus. The latter years of his reign were\r\nembittered by domestic dissensions and cruelties. He died while\r\nbesieging Sigeth, a city of Hungary, in 1566. His son and successor,\r\nSelim II., besieged and took Cyprus; but in the famous sea-fight at\r\nLepanto, in 1571, the Turkish fleet was utterly destroyed by Don John of\r\nAustria. Selim afterwards invested and took Tunis by storm. On his death\r\nAmurath III. ascended the throne, and extended his dominions. His son,\r\nMohammed III., ascended the throne in 1595, but he was involved in a\r\nseries of wars which proved disastrous to the Turkish arms, and the\r\ncountry continued to decline, although each successive monarch continued\r\nto wage war with the neighboring provinces, which nearly always ended\r\ndisastrously to the Turkish arms; the country was also torn asunder by\r\ninternal strife. The downward course of Turkey was for a time stayed by\r\nMustapha II., who succeeded to the throne in 1695; he commanded his\r\ntroops in person, and passed the Danube at the head of 50,000 men,\r\ncarried Lippa by assault, and closed a campaign against the Austrians\r\nwith success. But two years afterwards he was defeated by Prince Eugène,\r\nin the bloody battle of Zenta, where the Turks left 20,000 dead on the\r\nfield, and 10,000 were drowned in their attempt to escape. Shortly after\r\nthis disaster Mustapha was dethroned. During the reign of Mustapha III.,\r\nin 1769, a destructive war broke out with Russia which lasted till 1774,\r\nwhen the Turks were compelled to make the dishonorable treaty of\r\nKainargi. Another disastrous war broke out between Russia and Turkey in\r\nthe autumn of 1787, in which Austria took sides with the former. This\r\nwar, which was concluded in 1792, was a series of terrible conflicts, in\r\nwhich much desperate valor was displayed on the one side, and many brave\r\nactions were performed on the other; but in which Turkey lost much\r\nterritory. Turkey was drawn into the French revolutionary war by the\r\ninvasion of Egypt by the French, and in 1807 she was convulsed by a\r\nsanguinary insurrection, which cost Selim his throne, and raised Mahmoud\r\nto it. During the event of this insurrection, a war which had been going\r\non with Russia had languished; but on the accession of Mahmoud, the\r\narmies on both sides were augmented, and the contest was carried on with\r\ngreat ferocity. The campaign of 1811 was short, but disastrous to the\r\nPorte, the main body of the Ottoman army having surrendered as prisoners\r\nof war. In 1821 began that celebrated insurrection which, after a bloody\r\nwar of eight years, terminated in the complete emancipation of the\r\nGreeks from the Turkish yoke. In 1828 war again broke out between Turkey\r\nand Russia. The first campaign was unfavorable to Turkey, but not\r\ncompletely decisive; it ended with the loss of Varna; but, in 1829, the\r\nRussians having crossed the Balkans, a treaty of peace was concluded,\r\nwhich was both humiliating and injurious. Shortly after occurred that\r\nrupture between the sultan and Mehemet Ali, the pasha of Egypt, which\r\nshook the Ottoman empire to its foundation. In every conflict the\r\nTurkish troops were overthrown. The battle of Homs decided the fate of\r\nSyria, and the victory at Konieh placed the sceptre almost within the\r\ngrasp of the ambitious pasha. In this extremity the sultan was reduced\r\nto apply to Russia for aid. A peace was concluded by which the pasha\r\naugmented his territory. In 1839 the Turks were again defeated in\r\nseveral battles by the Egyptians; but the latter were reduced to\r\nsubjection by the allied powers, Britain, Austria, Russia, and Prussia,\r\nand compelled to pay an annual tribute to Turkey. In October, 1858, the\r\nPorte declared war against Russia, and in 1854 the French and English\r\nentered into the contest as allies of Turkey. In the latter part of this\r\nwar, Sardinia also sent an army to co-operate with those of the allies.\r\nThe result of this war, which was virtually ended by the treaty of Paris\r\nsigned on March 30, 1856, was, that Turkey gained some territory, and\r\ntook her place as a member of the European confederation of states. A\r\nrevolution took place in Constantinople in 1876, which resulted in the\r\ndeposition of Abd-ul-Aziz, and the accession to the throne of Murad V.,\r\nwho in his turn was superseded by Hamid II. For important battles, etc.,\r\nwhich occurred in Turkey, see names of towns, places, etc., under\r\nseparate headings in this work.\r\n\r\n=Turks.= The name of a numerous, important, and widely-spread family of\r\nthe human race, members of which are to be found as well on the banks of\r\nthe Lena in Siberia, as on those of the Danube and the shores of the\r\nAdriatic in Europe. They consist of many different tribes, but speak\r\nvery nearly the same language. For history of the Turks, see TURKEY and\r\nother countries inhabited by them.\r\n\r\n=Turma.= In the Roman cavalry, a troop consisting of 30 horsemen. There\r\nwere 10 _turmæ_ in every legion, and 3 _decuriæ_ in every _turma_.\r\n\r\n=Turn.= To give another direction, tendency, or inclination; to direct\r\notherwise; to deflect. _To turn a hostile army_, to turn the enemy’s\r\nflank, and the like, to pass round and take a position behind it, or\r\nupon the side of it. _To turn tail_, to retreat ignominiously.\r\n\r\n=Turn Out, To.= To bring forward, to exhibit; as, to turn out the guard;\r\nto turn out so many men for service. To _turn in_, to withdraw; to order\r\nunder cover; as, to turn in the guard.\r\n\r\n=Turnau= (Boh. _Turnov_). A walled town of Bohemia, circle of\r\nJung-Bunzlau, on the east bank of the Iser, 50 miles northeast from\r\nPrague. Here was fought, in July, 1866, a battle between the Prussians\r\nand Austrians, in which the former were victorious.\r\n\r\n=Turnhout.= A well-built town of Belgium, province of Antwerp, 34 miles\r\neast-northeast from the city of Antwerp. Turnhout is historically\r\nnoteworthy as the scene of two battles, the first won January 22, 1597,\r\nby the Netherlands, under Maurice, prince of Orange, over the Spaniards;\r\nand the second October 27, 1789, by the patriots, under Van der Mersch,\r\nover the Austrians.\r\n\r\n=Turning.= In tactics, a manœuvre by which an enemy or position is\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n=Turning and Boring.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Turret.= In military antiquity, a movable building, of a square form,\r\nconsisting of 10 or even 20 stories, sometimes 120 cubits high, usually\r\nmoved on wheels, and employed in approaches to a fortified place, for\r\ncarrying soldiers, engines, ladders, casting bridges, and other\r\nnecessaries.\r\n\r\n=Turtukai=, or =Tortokan=. A town of Turkey in Europe, in Bulgaria,\r\nsituated on the Danube. It is opposite Oltenitza, where the Russians\r\nwere defeated by the Turks in a series of battles which extended over\r\nthree days, in November, 1853.\r\n\r\n=Tuscany= (Ital. _Toscana_). A former grand duchy of Italy, hounded on\r\nthe north by the duchies of Parma and Modena, and the Papal States; east\r\nand south by the Papal States; west by the Mediterranean. Tuscany\r\nembraces the far greater part of ancient Etruria, shared the common fate\r\nof all the other Italian states, and fell under the Romans about 280\r\nB.C. From the Romans it passed first to the Goths, next to the Lombards,\r\nand then to Charlemagne, who governed it by counts. After numerous\r\nvicissitudes, the whole of Tuscany became united, in 1557, under the\r\nMedici family. In 1737 the Medici became extinct and the grand duchy\r\npassed to the Duke of Lorraine. It was declared by Napoleon I. an\r\nintegral part of the French empire; but, on his downfall in 1814, it was\r\nrestored to the Archduke Ferdinand. On August 20, 1860, the National\r\nAssembly at Florence unanimously voted its annexation to and it now\r\nforms part of the new kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\n=Tuscaroras.= A tribe of North American Indians, who at the settlement\r\nof North Carolina had fifteen towns on the Tar and Neuse Rivers, and\r\n1200 warriors. In 1711, they began a war with the settlers, and after a\r\nseries of savage encounters were defeated, and joined the Iroquois in\r\nNew York, where they became the allies of the English. About 400 of them\r\nstill reside on a reservation in the western part of the State of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n=Tusculum.= An ancient city of Latium, on a western prolongation of the\r\nAlban hills, about 15 miles east-southeast of Rome. It was one of the\r\nmost strongly fortified places in all Italy, both by nature and art.\r\nAfter the expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, Octavius Mamilius, the\r\nchief man in Tusculum, is said to have supported their cause, and led an\r\narmy against the Romans; but he was totally defeated and slain at the\r\nsmall lake Regillus, near Tusculum. Thereupon an alliance was formed\r\nbetween Tusculum and Rome, which lasted unbroken for 140 years, until,\r\nin 357 B.C., the whole of the Latin cities, and Tusculum among the rest,\r\njoined in a war with Rome, which ended in their entire and final\r\nsubjection to that power. The ancient city continued to exist amid all\r\nthe vicissitudes of the times till near the end of the 12th century,\r\nwhen it was demolished by the Romans, and the town of Frascati rose in\r\nthe vicinity.\r\n\r\n=Tuttlingen.= A town of Würtemberg, on the right bank of the Danube, 20\r\nmiles west-southwest from Sigmaringen. Tuttlingen is historically\r\nnotable as the scene of a battle in 1643, during the Thirty Years’ War,\r\nin which an Austrian Bavarian force under Hatzfeld and Mercy defeated\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\n=Twist.= This term is employed by gun-makers to express the inclination\r\nof a groove at any point, and is measured by the tangent of the angle\r\nmade by the groove with the axis of the bore.\r\n\r\n=Two-handed.= Used with both hands; as, a two-handed sword.\r\n\r\n=Tyana= (ruins at _Kiz Hisar_). A city of Asia Minor, stood in the south\r\nof Cappadocia, at the northern foot of Mount Taurus, on the high road to\r\nthe Cicilian Gates. It was a position of great natural strength, which\r\nwas improved by fortifications. Under Caracalla it was made a Roman\r\ncolony. It was taken in 272 B.C. by Aurelian, in the war with Zenobia,\r\nto whose territory it then belonged.\r\n\r\n=Tycocktow Island.= An island in the Canton River, China, 8 miles long\r\nand 6 miles broad. It is situated at the entrance of the Bocca Tigris, a\r\nfew miles below Canton. The British took the fort on this island in\r\n1841.\r\n\r\n=Tykoczin.= A town of Russia in Europe, situated on the Narew, 17 miles\r\nnorthwest from Bialystock. A battle was fought between the Russians and\r\nPoles here in 1831.\r\n\r\n=Tyler’s Insurrection.= Arose in opposition of the poll-tax imposed on\r\nall persons above fifteen, November 5, 1380. One of the collectors\r\nacting with indecent rudeness to Wat Tyler’s daughter, the father struck\r\nhim dead, June, 1381. His neighbors took arms to defend him, and in a\r\nshort time almost the whole of the population of the southern and\r\neastern counties were in a state of insurrection, extorting freedom from\r\ntheir lords, and plundering. On June 12, 1381, they gathered upon\r\nBlackheath to the number of 100,000 men. On June 14, they murdered Simon\r\nof Sudbury, archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Robert Hales, the royal\r\ntreasurer. The king, Richard II., invited Tyler to a parley, which took\r\nplace on the 15th at Smithfield, where the latter addressed the king in\r\na menacing manner, now and again lifting up his sword. On this the\r\nmayor, Walworth, stunned Tyler with a blow of his mace, and one of the\r\nking’s knights dispatched him. Richard temporized with the multitude by\r\npromising them a charter, and thus led them out of the city, when Sir R.\r\nKnollys and a band of knights attacked and dispersed them with much\r\nslaughter. The insurrection in Norfolk and Suffolk was subdued by the\r\nbishop of Norwich, and 1500 of the rebels were executed.\r\n\r\n=Tympanum.= A drum, a musical instrument which the ancients used, and\r\nwhich consisted of a thin piece of leather or skin, stretched upon a\r\ncircle of wood or iron, and beat with the hand. Hence the origin of our\r\ndrum.\r\n\r\n=Tyrant.= A name given in modern times to an arbitrary and oppressive\r\nruler, but originally applied, not necessarily to one who exercised\r\npower badly, but merely to one who had obtained it illegally, and\r\ntherefore equivalent to our word usurper. If the one who thus rose to\r\npower as a “tyrant” happened to be a man of sense, and wisdom, and\r\ngenerosity, his “tyranny” might prove a blessing to a state torn by the\r\nanimosities of selfish oligarchs, and be the theme of praise in\r\nafter-ages, as was the case with the “tyrannies” of Pesistratos, Gelon,\r\nand others; but if he was insolent, rapacious, and cruel, then he\r\nsought to reduce the citizens to a worse than Egyptian bondage, and his\r\nname became infamous to all time. Such has been the fate of most of the\r\n“Thirty Tyrants of Athens.” It was the method of exercising authority\r\npursued by these and similar usurpers that latterly, even in ancient\r\ntimes, gave the word tyrant that evil significance it has ever since\r\nuninterruptedly retained.\r\n\r\n=Tyre= (ruins at _Sur_). One of the greatest and most famous cities of\r\nthe ancient world, stood on the coast of Phœnice, about 20 miles south\r\nof Sidon. The Assyrian king Shalmanezer laid siege to Tyre for five\r\nyears (713 B.C.), but without success. It was again besieged for\r\nthirteen years by Nebuchadnezzar, and there is a tradition that he took\r\nit (572 B.C.), but the matter is not quite certain. At the period when\r\nthe Greeks began to be well acquainted with the city, its old site had\r\nbeen abandoned, and a new city erected on a small island about half a\r\nmile from the shore, and a mile in length, and a little north of the\r\nremains of the former city, which was now called Old Tyre. In 322 B.C.\r\nthe Tyrians refused to open their gates to Alexander, who laid siege to\r\nthe city for seven months, and united the island on which it stood to\r\nthe main land by a mole constructed chiefly of the ruins of Old Tyre.\r\nAfter its capture and sack by Alexander, Tyre never regained its former\r\nconsequence. It recovered, however, sufficiently to be mentioned as a\r\nstrong fortress and flourishing port under the early Roman emperors; it\r\neven took an active part (193) in the contest between Septimius Severus\r\nand Pescennius Niger, which, resulting in the success of the former,\r\nbrought back to it some of its ancient distinction. In St. Jerome’s time\r\nit was again one of the noblest and most prosperous cities of the whole\r\nEast. In the 7th century it came under the dominion of the Saracens; and\r\nso remained until taken by the Crusaders. On February 11, 1124, the\r\nChristian army encamped before it, and on June 15 it fell into their\r\nhands. The strength of its fortifications, the splendor of its houses,\r\nand the excellence of its harbor, excited their admiration. On the\r\nevening of the day on which Acre was taken by the Mohammedans (May 19,\r\n1291), Tyre was abandoned by the Crusaders, and the Saracens entered it\r\nthe following morning. It was captured by the French, April 3, 1799; and\r\nby the allied fleet, during the war against Mehemet Ali, 1841.\r\n\r\n=Tyrol.= The most western province of the Austrian empire, is bounded on\r\nthe north by Bavaria, on the east by Salzburg, Carinthia, and Venetia,\r\non the south by Italy, and on the west by Switzerland and Italy. In\r\nearly times Tyrol formed part of Rhætia, was conquered by the Romans, 15\r\nB.C. Subsequently it was overrun by various German tribes; still later\r\nthe southern valley fell to the share of the Lombards, and the northern\r\nvalleys to the Bavarians. The dukes of Austria acquired possession of it\r\nin 1363. The French conquered Tyrol in 1805, and united it to Bavaria,\r\nmuch to the discontent of the population; but in 1809 an insurrection\r\nbroke out, headed by Andreas Hofer, an innkeeper, who drove the\r\nBavarians out of the Tyrol, and thoroughly defeated some French\r\ndetachments, but was overpowered at last by reinforcements sent from\r\nFrance. The Tyrolese riflemen were very effective in the Italian war in\r\n1859.\r\n\r\n=Tyrone.= An inland county of the province of Ulster, in Ireland.\r\nAccording to some authorities the Erdini, and to others the Scoti, were\r\nthe earliest known inhabitants of this district. The chief town of\r\nTyrone was Dungannon, which, though several times taken and sacked by\r\nthe English forces in their attempts to reduce the country to obedience\r\nto the royal authority, continued to be of importance until the close of\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth, when it was burned by Hugh O’Neill, earl of\r\nTyrone, to prevent its falling into the hands of the English. The\r\ninsurrection of 1641 may be said to have had its commencement in this\r\ncounty, by the capture of Charlemont Fort and Dungannon by Sir Phelim\r\nO’Neill; and in 1646 the Parliamentary forces under Gen. Munroe received\r\na signal defeat from Hugh Roe O’Neill at Benburb. During the greater\r\npart of the war between King William and King James, this county was in\r\nthe possession of the forces of the latter, and suffered much from the\r\npartisan warfare carried on chiefly by the townsmen of Enniskillen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ucles.= A fortified town of Spain, in the province of Cuenca, 40 miles\r\nsouthwest from the town of that name. It stands at the foot of a hill\r\ncrowned by a famous monastery which belonged to the military order of\r\nSantiago or St. James of Spain. It was taken by the French in 1809.\r\n\r\n=Uglitch.= A town of European Russia, in the government and 60 miles\r\nwest-southwest from Jaroslav, on the right bank of the Volga. It was\r\ndestroyed by the Lithuanians in 1607.\r\n\r\n=Uhlans= (a Tartar word signifying “brave”). Light cavalry of Asiatic\r\norigin, were introduced into the north of Europe along with the colonies\r\nof Tartars, who established themselves in Poland and Lithuania. They\r\nwere mounted on light active Tartar horses, and armed with sabre, lance,\r\nand latterly with pistols. Their lance was from 5¹⁄₂ to 6¹⁄₂ feet in\r\nlength, and, like that of the modern lancers, was attached to a stout\r\nleather thong or cord, which was fastened to the left shoulder and\r\npassed round behind the back, so as to allow the lance to be couched\r\nunder the right arm. Immediately below its point was attached a strip of\r\ngaudy-colored cloth, the fluttering of which was designed to frighten\r\nthe enemies’ horses. The early dress was similar to that of the Turks,\r\nand the regiments, or _polks_, were distinguished from each other by the\r\nred, green, yellow, or blue color of their uniforms. The Austrians and\r\nPrussians were the first to borrow this species of cavalry from the\r\nPoles. In 1734, an attempt was made by Marshal Saxe to introduce uhlans\r\ninto France, and a “polk” of 1000 men was formed; but it was disbanded\r\nat the author’s death. At the present time, Russia, Prussia, and Austria\r\nare the only powers which possess uhlan regiments. In the British army,\r\nthe place of the uhlans is occupied by hussars.\r\n\r\n=Ukraine.= The name given in Poland first to the frontiers towards the\r\nTartars and other nomads, and then to the fertile regions lying on both\r\nsides of the middle Dnieper, without any very definite limits. The\r\nUkraine was long a bone of contention between Poland and Russia. It was\r\nceded to the Cossacks by Poland in 1672, and was obtained by Russia\r\nabout 1682. The country was divided, Poland having the west side of the\r\nDnieper, and Russia the east. The whole country was assigned to Russia\r\nby the treaty of partition in 1795. See POLAND.\r\n\r\n=Ulans.= See UHLANS.\r\n\r\n=Ulm.= The second city of Würtemberg; was, till the war in 1866, a\r\nstronghold of the Germanic Confederation. Here a peace was signed, July\r\n3, 1620, by which Frederick V. lost Bohemia (having been driven from it\r\npreviously). Ulm was taken by the French in 1796. After a battle between\r\nthe French and Austrians, in which the latter under Gen. Mack were\r\ndefeated with dreadful loss by Marshal Ney, Ulm surrendered with 28,000\r\nmen, the flower of the Austrian army, October 17-20, 1805.\r\n\r\n=Ulster.= A province of Ireland, the most northern of the four into\r\nwhich that kingdom is divided. The northeast portion, the present county\r\nof Down, was, early after the invasion, overrun by the English under De\r\nCourcy, and was subsequently held by Hugh De Lacy. Although various\r\nefforts were made by the English to effect a permanent settlement in the\r\nnorth and northwest, their success was little more than nominal until\r\nthe reigns of Elizabeth and James I., when the well-known plantation of\r\nUlster was attempted.\r\n\r\n=Ulster Badge.= On the institution of the order of Baronets in England\r\nby James I., a sinister hand, erect, open, and couped at the wrist\r\ngules, the armorial ensign of the province of Ulster, was made their\r\ndistinguishing badge, in respect of the order having been intended for\r\nthe encouragement of plantations in the province of Ulster. This badge\r\nis sometimes borne in a canton, sometimes on an escutcheon, the latter\r\nplaced either in the fess point or in the middle chief point, so as to\r\ninterfere as little as possible with the charges of the shield.\r\n\r\n=Ulster King-of-Arms.= The king-of-arms or chief heraldic officer of\r\nIreland. A king-of-arms called Ireland existed in the time of Richard\r\nII., but the office seems to have fallen into abeyance in the following\r\ncentury. Ulster was created to supply his place in 1552. Ulster holds\r\nhis appointment from the crown, and acts under the immediate direction\r\nof the lord-lieutenant of Ireland; the professional staff under him\r\nconsists of 2 heralds, 4 pursuivants, 1 registrar, and 1 clerk of\r\nrecords. The official arms of Ulster king-of-arms are: Argent, St.\r\nGeorge’s cross gules, on a chief of the last a lion passant gardant\r\nbetween a harp and a portcullis or.\r\n\r\n=Ultimatum.= A term used in military negotiations, to express the final\r\nconditions upon which any proposition or treaty can be ratified.\r\n\r\n=Umbon= (_Fr._). The pointed boss or prominent part in the centre of a\r\nshield or buckler.\r\n\r\n=Umbria.= A district of Italy, the chief towns of which were Arminum,\r\nFanum, Fortunæ, Mevania, Tuder, Narnia, and Spoletium. Under Augustus,\r\nit formed the sixth Regio of Italy. Its inhabitants, the Umbri, were one\r\nof the most ancient races of Italy, and were connected with the Opicans,\r\nSabines, and those other tribes whose languages were akin to the Greek.\r\nThe Umbri were at a very early period the most powerful people in\r\nCentral Italy, and extended across the peninsula from the Adriatic to\r\nthe Tyrrhene seas. They were afterwards deprived of their possessions\r\nwest of the Tiber by the Etruscans, and confined to the country between\r\nthis river and the Adriatic. Their territories were still further\r\ndiminished by the Senones, a Gallic people, who took possession of the\r\nwhole country on the coast, from Arminum to the Æsis. The Umbri were\r\nsubdued by the Romans, 307 B.C., and after the conquest of the Senones\r\nby the Romans in 283, they again obtained possession of the country on\r\nthe coast of the Adriatic. This district, however, continued to be\r\ncalled _Ager Gallicus_ down to a late period.\r\n\r\n=Umbriere.= The visor of a helmet, a projection like the peak of a cap,\r\nto which a face-guard was sometimes attached, which moved freely upon\r\nthe helmet, and could be raised like a beaver.\r\n\r\n=Unarm.= To strip of armor or arms; to disarm.\r\n\r\n=Unbreech.= To free the breech of, as a cannon, from its fastenings or\r\ncoverings.\r\n\r\n=Uncase, To.= To display or exhibit the colors of a regiment.\r\n\r\n=Uncock.= To let down the cock of, as a gun.\r\n\r\n=Unconditional.= At discretion; not limited by any terms or\r\nstipulations; as, an unconditional surrender.\r\n\r\n=Unconquered.= Not subdued or defeated; in opposition to conquered or\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n=Uncover, To.= When troops deploy, the different leading companies or\r\ndivisions, etc., successively uncover those in their rear, by marching\r\nout from the right or left of the column.\r\n\r\n=Undaunted.= Not appalled by fear; valiant.\r\n\r\n=Under.= A preposition of varied military application, in combination\r\nwith other words. Thus troops are said to be _under arms_, when\r\nassembled in a state of military array, and having the necessary weapons\r\nof offense and defense, as rifles, swords, etc. To be _under command_ is\r\nbeing liable to be ordered on any particular duty. To be _under cover_\r\nis to be shielded or protected. To be _under contribution_ is being\r\nliable to give, in money or kind, what may be authoritatively called\r\nfor. Countries are sometimes put under contribution for the support of\r\nan army. To be _under fire_ or be _cool_ is not being disconcerted by\r\nthe apprehension of death in battle. To be _under sentence_ is the\r\nliability to punishment, according to sentence passed; as, under the\r\nsentence of a general court-martial; under sentence of death.\r\n\r\n=Under Canvas.= In a military sense, it is to be lying in tents.\r\n\r\n=Undermine.= To dig an excavation under any fort, house, or other\r\nbuilding, so as to cause it to fall down or to blow it up with powder.\r\n\r\n=Under-officer.= An inferior officer, one in a subordinate situation.\r\n\r\n=Undisciplined.= Not yet trained to regularity or order; not perfect in\r\nexercise or manœuvres.\r\n\r\n=Undress.= In the military service, is the authorized habitual dress of\r\nofficers and soldiers when not in full uniform.\r\n\r\n=Unfix, To.= To take off; as, to unfix bayonets, on which the soldier\r\ndisengages the bayonet from his musket, and returns it to the scabbard.\r\n\r\n=Unfortified.= Not strengthened or secured by any walls, bulwarks, or\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\n=Unfortunate Peace, The.= A name given by historians to the peace of\r\nChateau Cambresis (April 2, 1559), negotiated by England, France, and\r\nSpain. By this treaty Henry II. of France renounced all claim to Genoa,\r\nCorsica, and Naples, agreed to restore Calais to the English within\r\neight years, and to give security for 500,000 crowns in case of failure.\r\n\r\n=Unfurled.= A standard or color when expanded and displayed, is said to\r\nbe unfurled.\r\n\r\n=Ungentlemanlike or Unofficerlike=. Not like a gentleman or officer.\r\nConduct unbecoming the character of either is so called. This clause,\r\nwhich will be always found to depend on the state of morals and manners,\r\naffords a vast latitude to a military court, which, after all, is not\r\nmore free from prejudice or influence than any other tribunal, though\r\nthey are both jurors and judges. Officers convicted thereof are to be\r\ndismissed from the service. See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 60, 61.\r\n\r\n=Unguled.= In heraldry, a term applied to the tincture of the hoofs of\r\nan animal; _e.g._, Azure, a stag trippant or, attired and unguled gules,\r\nthe arms of the family of Strachan in Scotland.\r\n\r\n=Unharnessed.= Disarmed; divested of armor or weapons of defense.\r\n\r\n=Unhelmed.= Divested of the helmet or helm.\r\n\r\n=Unhorsed.= Thrown from the saddle; dismounted.\r\n\r\n=Unicorn= (Lat. _unum cornu_, “one horn”). An animal, probably fabulous,\r\nmentioned by ancient Grecian and Roman authors as a native of India, and\r\ndescribed as being of the size of a horse, or larger, the body\r\nresembling that of a horse, and with one horn of a cubit and a half or\r\ntwo cubits long on the forehead, the horn straight, its base white, the\r\nmiddle black, the tip red. The body of the animal was also said to be\r\nwhite, its head red, its eyes blue. It was said to be so swift that no\r\nhorse could overtake it. The unicorn is perhaps best known as a heraldic\r\ncharge or supporter.

In consequence of this treaty, Russia landed 15,000\r\nmen at Scutari, and stopped the victorious career of Ibrahim Pasha. The\r\nsecret article was soon after divulged to Britain and France, both of\r\nwhom regarded the treaty with dislike; and by the terms of that\r\nconcluded at London, July 13, 1841, the stipulations of Unkiar-Skelessi\r\nwere annulled.\r\n\r\n=Unload.= To take the powder and ball out of a piece of ordnance or a\r\nmusket.\r\n\r\n=Unmilitary.= Contrary to rules of discipline; unworthy of a soldier.\r\n\r\n=Unsheathe.= To draw from the sheath or scabbard, as a sword; hence, to\r\nunsheathe the sword, sometimes signifies to commence or make war.\r\n\r\n=Unshot.= To remove the shot from, as a piece of ordnance; to take out\r\nthe shot of.\r\n\r\n=Unsling.= To take off the slings; to release from the slings; unsling\r\nknapsacks, etc.\r\n\r\n=Unspike.= To remove a spike from, as from the vent of a cannon.\r\n\r\n=Untenable.= Not to be held in possession; incapable of being defended.\r\n\r\n=Untrained.= Not disciplined to exercise or manœuvre.\r\n\r\n=Unvanquished.= Not conquered or defeated.\r\n\r\n=Unwarlike.= Not fit for or used to war.\r\n\r\n=Upbraid.= Any officer or soldier who shall upbraid another for refusing\r\na challenge, shall himself be punished as a challenger.

There have been serious difficulties between the U. S. government\r\nand the Mormons, who first arrived in the Great Salt Lake Valley in\r\n1847. A terrible massacre of settlers took place at Mountain Meadows,\r\nUtah, by Indians, who it is said were instigated to commit the terrible\r\natrocity by the Mormons. In order to put an end to all the disturbances\r\nin Utah, the President dispatched, in 1857, an expedition against\r\nBrigham Young, who was treated as an open rebel. Owing to the\r\ninclemency of the weather and other causes, the expedition did not\r\narrive in Utah until May, 1858, when the governor, Cumming, reported to\r\nthe President that Brigham Young had given up all hopes of resistance.\r\nThe Territory has remained quiet ever since.\r\n\r\n=Utahs=, or =Utes=.

It stood on the shore\r\nof the northern part of the Carthaginian Gulf, a little west of the\r\nmouth of the Bagrades, and 27 Roman miles northwest of Carthage; but its\r\nsite is now inland in consequence of the changes effected by the\r\nBagrades in the coast-line. In the third Punic war, Utica took part with\r\nthe Romans against Carthage, and was rewarded with the greatest part of\r\nthe Carthaginian territory. It afterwards became renowned to all future\r\ntime as the scene of the last stand made by the Pompeian party against\r\nCæsar, and of the glorious, though mistaken, self-sacrifice of the\r\nyounger Cato. It fell into the hands of the Vandals in 439; but its\r\nfinal destruction is due to the Saracens, who twice captured the town.\r\n\r\n=Utrecht= (the Roman _Trajectum ad Rhenum_).

The Veientes were\r\nengaged in almost unceasing hostilities with Rome for more than three\r\ncenturies and a half, and we have records of fourteen distinct wars\r\nbetween the two nations. Veii was at last taken by the dictator\r\nCamillus, after a siege of ten years, 396 B.C. The city fell into his\r\nhands, according to the common story, by means of a _cuniculus_, or\r\nmine, which was carried by Camillus from the Roman camp under the city\r\ninto the citadel of Veii. The citizens were massacred or sold as slaves,\r\nand the land confiscated.\r\n\r\n=Vekilchares.= A word used among the Turks, which signifies the same as\r\n_fourrier_ in the French and corresponds with quartermaster.\r\n\r\n=Velez-Malaga.= A fortified town in the south of Spain, in the province\r\nof Malaga, 16 miles east from the city of that name. The town was taken\r\nfrom the Moors, by Ferdinand the Catholic, after a long siege.\r\n\r\n=Velish.= A town of Russia in Europe, in the government of Vitepsk,\r\nsituated on the Dwina. This place, which was founded by the Russians in\r\n1536, was taken by the Poles in 1580, but in 1772 it again reverted to\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n=Velites.= In the Roman armies, the name of the light-armed troops, who\r\nwere first instituted during the second Punic war, and were remarkable\r\nfor their agility.\r\n\r\n=Velletri= (anc. _Velitræ_). A town of the Papal States, in the Comarca,\r\nand 21 miles southeast from Rome. The ancient _Velitræ_ was an important\r\nVolscian city destroyed by the Romans, but afterwards rebuilt. In 1734,\r\nCarlo Borbone, king of Naples, gained, near Velletri, a decisive victory\r\nover the Austrians, which secured the kingdom of the two Sicilies to the\r\nSpanish Bourbons.\r\n\r\n=Vellore.= A town and fortress of British India, in the presidency of\r\nMadras, situated on the river Palar, 80 miles southwest from Madras. It\r\nis very strongly fortified. After the capture of Seringapatam, in 1799,\r\nVellore was fixed on for the place of confinement or residence of the\r\nfamily of Tippoo Sahib. In July, 1806, a very serious mutiny took place\r\namong the garrison, composed principally of native troops. It was\r\nspeedily suppressed by the gallant conduct of Col. Gillespie of the 19th\r\nDragoons.\r\n\r\n=Velocimeter.= An instrument for obtaining initial velocity, invented by\r\nCol. Benton, U. S. Ordnance Department. See CHRONOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n=Velocity.= Is rate of motion; the relation of motion to time, measured\r\nby the number of units of space passed over by the moving body in a unit\r\nof time, usually the number of feet in a second. The velocity of a\r\nprojectile, at any point of its flight, is the space in _feet_ passed\r\nover in a _second_ of time, with a continuous, uniform motion. _Initial\r\nvelocity_ is the velocity at the muzzle of the piece; _remaining\r\nvelocity_ is the velocity at any point of the flight; _terminal\r\nvelocity_ is the velocity with which it strikes its object; and _final\r\nvelocity_ of descent in air, is the uniform velocity with which a\r\nprojectile moves, when the resistance of the air becomes equal to the\r\naccelerating force of gravity. The initial velocity of a projectile may\r\nbe determined by the principles of mechanics which govern the action of\r\nthe powder, the resistance of the projectile, etc., or by direct\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe instant that the charge of a fire-arm is converted into gas, it\r\nexerts an expansive effort which acts to drive the projectile out of the\r\nbore. If the gaseous mass be divided into elementary sections\r\nperpendicular to its length, it will be seen that, in their efforts to\r\nexpand, each section has not only to overcome its own inertia, but the\r\ninertia of the piece and projectile, as well as the inertia of the\r\nsections which precede it. The tension of each section, therefore,\r\nincreases from the extremities of the charge to some intermediate point\r\nwhere it is a maximum. The pressure on all sides of the section of\r\nmaximum density being equal, it will remain at rest, while all the\r\nothers will move in opposite directions, constantly pressing against the\r\nprojectile and piece, and accelerating their velocities. As the\r\nprojectile moves in the bore, the space in which the gases expand is\r\nincreased, while their density is diminished; it follows that the force\r\nwhich sets a projectile in motion in a fire-arm varies from several\r\ncauses: (1st) It varies as the space behind the projectile increases, or\r\nas the velocity regarded as a function of the time; (2d) It varies\r\nthroughout the column of gas for the same instant of time; and (3d) It\r\nvaries from the increasing quantities of gas developed in the successive\r\ninstants of the combustion of the powder. See INITIAL VELOCITY.\r\n\r\nThe motion of a body falling through the air will be accelerated by its\r\nweight, and retarded by the buoyant effort of the air, and the\r\nresistance which the air offers to motion. As the resistance of the air\r\nincreases more rapidly than the velocity, it follows that there is a\r\npoint where the retarding and accelerating forces will be equal, and\r\nthat beyond this the body will move with a uniform velocity, equal to\r\nthat which it had acquired down to this point. The buoyant effort of the\r\nair is equal to the weight of the volume displaced, or\r\n\r\n     (_d_)\r\n  _P_(---);\r\n     (_D_)\r\n\r\nin which _P_ is the weight and _D_ the density of the projectile, and\r\n_d_ the density of the air. When the projectile meets with a resistance\r\nequal to its weight, we shall have,\r\n\r\n     (    _d_)              (    _v_)\r\n  _P_(1 - ---) = _A_{p}R²v²_(1 + ---); (15)\r\n     (    _D_)              (    _r_)\r\n\r\nin which the weight of the displaced air is transferred to the first\r\nmember of the equation. As the density of the air is very slight\r\ncompared to that of lead or iron, the materials of which projectiles are\r\nmade, _d_/_D_ may be neglected. Making this change, and substituting for\r\n_P_, _⁴⁄₃_{p}R^{3}D_, the expression for the _final velocity_ reduces to\r\n\r\n      (    _v_)      _RD_\r\n  _v_²(1 + ---) = ⁴⁄₃-----. (16)\r\n      (    _r_)      _A_\r\n\r\nThe resistance on the entire projectile for a velocity of 1 foot, is\r\n_A_{p}R²_; dividing this by _P_/_g_, or the mass, we get the resistance\r\non a unit of mass. Calling this 1/(2_c_) we have,\r\n\r\n    1    _A_{p}R²_               _P_\r\n  ---- = ---------, or 2_gc_ = --------.\r\n  2_c_      _P_                _A_{p}R²_\r\n            ---\r\n            _g_\r\n\r\nSubstituting for _P_ its value in the equation of vertical descent, we\r\nhave,\r\n\r\n              (    _v_)\r\n  2_gc_ = _v_²(1 + ---);\r\n              (    _r_)\r\n\r\nfrom which we see that _v_ depends only on _c_; but\r\n\r\n           _RD_\r\n  _c_ = ²⁄₃----- (17)\r\n           _gA_\r\n\r\nhence, the _final velocity_ of a projectile falling through the air is\r\ndirectly proportional to the product of its diameter and density, and\r\ninversely proportional to the density of the air, which is a factor of\r\n_A_. The expression for the value of _c_ shows that the retarding effect\r\nof the air is less on the larger and denser projectiles. To adapt it to\r\nan oblong projectile of the pointed form, the value of _D_ should be\r\nincreased (inasmuch as its weight is increased in proportion to its\r\ncross-section), while that of _A_ should be diminished. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that for the same caliber an oblong projectile will be less\r\nretarded by the air than one of spherical form, and consequently with an\r\nequal and perhaps less initial velocity, its range will be greater.\r\n\r\n=Velocity of Light.= See LIGHT, VELOCITY OF.\r\n\r\n=Velocity of Sound.= See SOUND.\r\n\r\n=Vendée, La.= A department in the west of France. The _wars of La\r\nVendée_ denote the armed opposition to the religious and political\r\nchanges in France, which burst out into a species of partisan warfare in\r\n1793, 1794, 1795, 1799, and 1815.\r\n\r\n=Venezuela.= A republic in the northwest of South America. The east\r\ncoast of Venezuela was discovered by Columbus in 1498; Ojeda and\r\nVespucci followed in 1499. The first settlement was made at Cumana in\r\n1520, by the Spaniards; and Venezuela remained subject to Spain till it\r\nclaimed independence in 1811. In 1812, it returned to allegiance to\r\nSpain, but again revolted in 1813, and, forming with New Granada and\r\nEcuador the republic of Colombia, it was declared independent in 1819.\r\nIn 1831, the states separated. During the ten years from 1861-1871,\r\nupwards of 60,000 persons were killed in the civil wars. The revolution\r\ntriumphed, and Guzman Blanco attempted to establish a government at\r\nCaraccas, which was captured by revolutionists, April, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Venice.= A fortified city of Northern Italy, one of the noblest, most\r\nfamous, and singular cities in the world, is built upon a crowded\r\ncluster of islets, in the lagoon of the same name, on the northwest\r\nfringe of the Adriatic Sea, 23 miles east of Padua. It was founded by\r\nfamilies from Aquileia and Padua fleeing from Attila, about 452. Under\r\ntheir third doge (720-737) the Venetians entered upon that career of\r\nenterprise in which their prudence and valor were almost always\r\nconspicuous, and which they continued to pursue to the last. Venice\r\nafter a series of enterprises which covered a period of 700 years, and\r\nin which she was nearly always successful, gaining territory and\r\nprestige, entered into a war with the Turks in 1461, which lasted until\r\n1477, and in which she lost many of her Eastern possessions. The\r\nVenetians took Cyprus in 1475, and helped to overcome Charles VIII. of\r\nFrance in 1495; they excited the Turks against Charles V. in 1504, and\r\nwere nearly ruined by the league of Cambray in 1508. They also assisted\r\nin defeating the Turks at Lepanto in 1571, but lost Cyprus to the Turks\r\nin the same year. The Venetians gained several important naval victories\r\nover the Turks at Scio in 1651, and in the Dardanelles in 1655, but lost\r\nCandia, one of their possessions, in 1669; recovered part of the Morea\r\nin 1683-99, but lost it again in 1715-39. Venice was occupied by\r\nBonaparte in 1797, who, by the treaty of Campo Formio, gave part of its\r\nterritory to Austria, and annexed the remainder to the Cisalpine\r\nrepublic. In 1805 the whole of Venice was annexed to the kingdom of\r\nItaly by the treaty of Presburg; but was transferred to the empire of\r\nAustria in 1814, and the city declared a free port in 1830. An\r\ninsurrection began in Venice on March 22, 1848, and the city, which was\r\ndefended by Daniele Manin, surrendered to the Austrians after a long\r\nsiege on August 22, 1849. It was transferred to Italy, October 17, 1866,\r\nby the treaty of Vienna.\r\n\r\n=Venlo.= A small but strongly fortified town in the Netherlands,\r\nprovince of Limburg, situated on the right bank of the Maas, 45 miles\r\nnorth-northeast from Maastricht. Venlo was walled by Duke Reynold of\r\nGelder in 1343. It has many a time felt the horrors of a siege, and has\r\nbeen taken and retaken, the last time by the Belgians in 1830, in whose\r\nhands it remained till the conference of London, June 22, 1839, when it\r\nreturned to the Dutch.\r\n\r\n=Vennones.= A people of Rhætia, and, according to Strabo, the most\r\nsavage of the Rhætian tribes, inhabiting the Alps near the sources of\r\nthe Athesis.\r\n\r\n=Vent.= In gunnery, is the aperture through which fire is communicated\r\nto the charge. It should be as small as the use of the priming-wire and\r\ntube will allow. See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF, INTERIOR FORM OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Ventail.= That part of a helmet which is made to lift up.\r\n\r\n=Vent-gauges.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Vent-piece.= In some ordnance is a piece of copper containing the vent,\r\nand screwed in at the proper position.\r\n\r\n=Vent-punch.= See IMPLEMENTS, EQUIPMENTS AND MACHINES.\r\n\r\n=Vent-searcher.= See INSPECTION OF CANNON.\r\n\r\n=Vera Cruz.= An ancient city on the east coast of Mexico, about 185\r\nmiles east of the city of Mexico. The castle of Ulloa and the city were\r\nbombarded and taken by the Americans in 1847, and the city was taken by\r\nthe allies, December 17, 1861. Vera Cruz was retaken by the liberals,\r\nunder Juarez, June 27, 1867.\r\n\r\n=Verat= (_Fr._). A 12-pounder gun of 17 calibers, weighing 2300 pounds,\r\nhaving a charge of 8 pounds.\r\n\r\n=Verbal Orders.= Instructions given by word of mouth, which, when\r\ncommunicated through an official channel, are to be considered as\r\nequally binding with written ones.\r\n\r\n=Vercelli= (anc. _Vercellæ_). A town of the kingdom of Sardinia, capital\r\nof a province of the same name. Near this place Varus defeated the\r\nCimbri, 101 B.C. It was the seat of a republic in the 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies. It was taken by the Spaniards in 1630; by the French in 1704;\r\nand allies, 1706; it subsequently partook of the fortunes of Piedmont.\r\n\r\n=Verden.= A town in Hanover, Germany, on the right bank of the Aller.\r\nHere Charlemagne massacred about 4500 Saxons, who had rebelled and\r\nrelapsed into idolatry, 782.\r\n\r\n=Verdict.= See FINDING.\r\n\r\n=Verdoy.= In heraldry, a term indicating that a bordure is charged with\r\nflowers, leaves, or vegetable charges. Thus a bordure argent verdoy of\r\noak-leaves proper, is equivalent to a bordure argent charged with eight\r\noak-leaves proper.\r\n\r\n=Verdun= (anc. _Verodunum_). A fortified town of France in the\r\ndepartment of Meuse, on the right bank of the river of that name, about\r\n150 miles (direct line) east-northeast from Paris, it was fortified by\r\nVauban, and its defenses consist of a wall with bastions and a citadel.\r\nIt was acquired by the Franks in the 6th century, and formed part of the\r\ndominions of Lothaire by the treaty of Verdun, 543, when the empire was\r\ndivided between the sons of Louis I. It was taken and annexed to the\r\nempire of Otho I. about 939. It surrendered to France in 1552, and was\r\nformally ceded in 1648. It was taken and held by the Prussians\r\nforty-three days, September-October, 1792. Gen. Beaurepaire, the\r\ncommandant, committed suicide before the surrender, and fourteen ladies\r\nwere executed in 1794, for going to the king of Prussia to solicit his\r\nclemency for the town. Verdun surrendered to the Germans, November 8,\r\n1870, after a brave defense, two vigorous sallies being made October 28.\r\nAbove 4000 men and 108 cannon were captured, and much arms and\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\n=Vere, de.= The name of an ancient and noble family of England,\r\ndescended from a Norman knight who had a high command at the battle of\r\nHastings. His son became earl of Oxford, and minister of Henry I. The\r\nthird earl was one of the barons who extorted the Magna Charta from King\r\nJohn. John de Vere, seventh earl, was a famous commander, and fought at\r\nCrécy and Poitiers (1356). The thirteenth earl was a leader of the\r\nLancastrian party in the war of the Roses, and commanded the van of the\r\narmy of Henry VII. at Bosworth (1485). The twentieth earl was Aubrey de\r\nVere, who fought for Charles I. in the civil war, and after the\r\nrestoration became lord-lieutenant of Essex.\r\n\r\n=Vergette= (_Fr._). In heraldry, a pallet or small pale; hence, a shield\r\ndivided by pallets or pales.\r\n\r\n=Vermeuil.= A town of France, in the department of the Eure, situated on\r\nthe Arve. It was the scene of a battle between the Burgundians and\r\nEnglish, under the Duke of Bedford, and the French, assisted by the\r\nScots, commanded by the Count de Narbonne and the Earls of Douglas and\r\nBuchan, etc. The French at first were successful; but some Lombard\r\nauxiliaries, who had taken the English camp, commenced pillaging. Two\r\nthousand English archers then came fresh to the attack; and the French\r\nand Scots were totally defeated, and their leaders killed.\r\n\r\n=Vermont.= One of the United States of America, and one of the five New\r\nEngland States; it was the first State received after the adoption of\r\nthe Federal Constitution. Vermont is bounded on the north by Canada, on\r\nthe east by the Connecticut River, which separates it from New\r\nHampshire, on the south by Massachusetts, and on the west by New York,\r\nfrom which it is separated for 100 miles by Lake Champlain. The first\r\nsettlement made in this State was in 1724, when it was claimed as a part\r\nof the New Hampshire grants. In 1763, it was claimed by New York, under\r\ngrants of Charles II. to the Duke of York. For ten years the New York\r\nofficers were resisted, and sometimes tied to trees and whipped by the\r\nlawless settlers. These contests were stopped by the Revolution, but\r\nthis State, a refuge for settlers from the other States, remained eight\r\nyears out of the Union. It was chiefly the Vermont militia that gained\r\nthe victory of Plattsburg, on Lake Champlain, in 1812; and the Green\r\nMountain State contributed largely to the Union forces in the war of the\r\nRebellion.\r\n\r\n=Verolamium=, or =Verulamium= (now _Old Verulam_, near St. Alban’s). The\r\nchief town of the Catuellani in Britain, probably the residence of the\r\nking Cassivellaunus, which was conquered by Cæsar. It was subsequently\r\nmade a Roman _municipium_. It was destroyed by the Britons under\r\nBoadicea, in their insurrection against the Romans, but was rebuilt, and\r\ncontinued to be an important place.\r\n\r\n=Verona.= An ancient city of Northern Italy, in Venetia, 72 miles west\r\nof Venice by railway. Verona is a fortress of the first rank, a member\r\nof the famous Quadrilateral (which see), and has always been considered\r\na place of strength since it was surrounded with walls by the emperor\r\nGallienus, 265. Its modern fortifications are among the most\r\nextraordinary works of military engineering in Europe. After passing\r\ninto the hands of the Austrians, in 1815, it was greatly strengthened;\r\nand since 1849 every effort has been made to render it impregnable. The\r\nearly history of Verona is involved in obscurity. It fell into the hands\r\nof the Romans, and under the empire became one of the most flourishing\r\ncities in the north of Italy. Constantine took it by assault in 312;\r\nStilicho defeated the Goths here in 402; and on September 27, 489,\r\nTheodoric defeated Odoacer, king of Italy. Charlemagne took it in 774,\r\nand made it the royal residence of his son, King Pepin. In 1405 the city\r\ngave itself over to Venice, in order to free itself from its tyrants,\r\nwho were alternately of the Scala, the Visconti, or the Carrara\r\nfamilies. It was held by Venice till its capture by the French general\r\nMasséna, June 3, 1796. Near here Charles Albert of Sardinia defeated the\r\nAustrians, May 6, 1848. It was surrendered to the Italian government,\r\nOctober 16, 1866.\r\n\r\n=Versailles.= A celebrated city of France, and long the residence of the\r\nFrench court, capital of the department of Seine-et-Oise, 11 miles\r\nsouthwest from Paris. Here was signed the treaty (September 3, 1783), at\r\nwhich England recognized the independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica. On the same day a treaty was signed here between Great\r\nBritain, France, and Spain, by which Pondicherry and Carical, with other\r\npossessions in Bengal, were restored to France, and Trincomalee restored\r\nto the Dutch. Here was held the military festival of the royal guards,\r\nOctober 1, 1789, which was immediately followed (on the 5th and 6th) by\r\nthe attack of the mob, who massacred the guards and brought the king\r\nback to Paris. Versailles, with the troops there, surrendered to the\r\nGermans September 19, 1870, and the crown-prince of Prussia entered the\r\nnext day. On September 26, he awarded the iron cross to above thirty\r\nsoldiers at the foot of the statue of Louis XIV. The palace was\r\nconverted into a hospital. The royal headquarters were removed here from\r\nFerrières, October 5.\r\n\r\n=Vert.= In heraldry, coats of arms are distinguished from one another\r\nnot only by the charges or objects borne on them, but by the color of\r\nthese charges, and of the field on which they are placed. _Vert_ (green)\r\nis indicated in uncolored heraldic engravings by diagonal lines from\r\ndexter chief to sinister base.\r\n\r\n=Vertical Fire.= See FIRE, VERTICAL.\r\n\r\n=Vervels=, or =Varvels=. Small rings attached to the ends of the jesses\r\nof a hawk, through which a string was passed to fasten them to its leg.\r\nThey occur as a heraldic charge.\r\n\r\n=Vervins.= A town of France, in the department of the Aisne, 23 miles\r\nnortheast from Laon. A treaty of peace was concluded here in 1598\r\nbetween Philip II. of Spain and Henry IV. of France.\r\n\r\n=Veseronce.= In Southeast France, near Vienne. Here Gondemar, king of\r\nthe Burgundians, defeated and killed Clodomir, king of Orleans, and\r\nrevenged the murder of his brother Sigismond and his family, 524. This\r\nconflict is also called the battle of Voiron.\r\n\r\n=Vespers, Sicilian.= See SICILIAN VESPERS.\r\n\r\n=Vestini.= A Sabellian people in Central Italy, lying between the\r\nApennines and the Adriatic Sea. They are mentioned in connection with\r\nthe Marsi, Marrucini, and Peligni; but they subsequently separated from\r\nthese tribes, and joined the Samnites in their war against Rome. They\r\nwere conquered by the Romans, 328 B.C., and from this time appear as the\r\nallies of Rome. They joined the other allies in the Marsic war, and were\r\nconquered by Pompeius Strabo in 89.\r\n\r\n=Veteran.= Long exercised in anything, especially in military life and\r\nthe duties of a soldier; long practiced or experienced; as, a veteran\r\nofficer or soldier.\r\n\r\n=Veteran.= One who has been long exercised in any service or art,\r\nparticularly in war; one who has grown old in service, and has had much\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n=Veteran Corps.= Are among the military reserves of all nations. They\r\nconsist of old soldiers past the prime of active manhood, and incapable\r\nof taking the field. Their discipline and steadiness, however,\r\nadmirably fit them for garrisons or fortresses, and for the instruction\r\nof young troops. During the civil war in America (1861-65), a\r\nveteran reserve corps was established under the command of the\r\nprovost-marshal-general. The men admitted into this corps were drawn\r\nfrom three sources, viz.: (1) By taking officers and men still in the\r\nfield, who had been disabled by wounds or by disease contracted in the\r\nline of duty; (2) By taking officers and men who were absent sick in\r\nhospitals or convalescent camps; and (3) By accepting officers and men\r\nwho had been honorably discharged on account of wounds or disease\r\ncontracted in the line of duty, and who desired to re-enter the service.\r\nThis corps was divided into companies, battalions, and regiments, and\r\nwas employed to enforce the enrolling and drafting of men for active\r\nservice, for arresting deserters, stragglers, etc., and as a garrison\r\nfor permanent barracks, etc. Upon the reduction of the army in 1869, the\r\ncorps was discontinued.\r\n\r\n=Veterinary.= Of or pertaining to the art of healing or treating the\r\ndiseases of domestic animals, as horses, etc. In England and some other\r\nEuropean countries, a veterinary surgeon is a commissioned officer, who\r\nhas medical charge of horses used in the military service. In the U. S.\r\nservice there is one veterinary surgeon allowed to each of the regiments\r\nof cavalry, and the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th regiments of cavalry have an\r\nadditional veterinary surgeon. These veterinary surgeons are recognized\r\nas civilians.\r\n\r\n=Vetterlin Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Vexilla.= Flags or streamers, given to the Roman soldiers who\r\ndistinguished themselves. They were embroidered in silk, and fixed on\r\nthe top of a spear. _Vexillum roseum_ was a red flag, which the general,\r\non any sudden tumult or unforeseen danger, brought out of the Capitol,\r\nand encouraged the people to flock to it as recruits for infantry.\r\n\r\n=Viazma.= A town of European Russia, on the river of the same name, in\r\nthe government and 100 miles east-northeast from Smolensk. The French\r\nwere defeated here by the Russians, October 22, 1812, when a great part\r\nof the town was destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\n=Vibo= (now _Bivona_). The Roman form of the Greek town Hipponium,\r\nsituated on the southwestern coast of Bruttium. It was destroyed by the\r\nelder Dionysius, who transplanted its inhabitants to Syracuse. It was\r\nafterwards destroyed, and at a later time it fell into the hands of the\r\nBruttii by the Romans, who colonized it 194 B.C., and called it Vibo\r\nValentia.\r\n\r\n=Vicenza.= A city of Northern Italy, in the province of Venice, 39 miles\r\nwest from Venice. Vicenza was a Roman station, and suffered greatly on\r\nthe irruption of the northern tribes. It was successively pillaged by\r\nAlaric, Attila, the Lombards, and the emperor Frederick II. In the\r\nearly part of the 15th century it came into the possession of the\r\nVenetians, who held it till 1796, when it became the scene of sanguinary\r\nconflicts between the French and Austrians.\r\n\r\n=Vicksburg.= A city and port of Mississippi, on the Mississippi River,\r\n408 miles north of New Orleans, and is the chief town between Memphis\r\nand New Orleans. It was strongly fortified in 1861, and provided with a\r\nlarge garrison. In January, 1862, it was attacked by the Federal naval\r\nforces from Memphis and New Orleans, but without success. In April,\r\n1863, a naval attack was combined with the land forces under Gen. Grant,\r\nwho defeated Gen. Pemberton near Jackson, cut off supplies and\r\nreinforcements from the garrison, and with a close siege and continual\r\nassaults, compelled a surrender, July 4, 1863, with 30,000 prisoners of\r\nwar, 200 cannon, and 70,000 stand of arms.\r\n\r\n=Victor.= The winner in a contest; one who gets the better of another in\r\nany struggle; especially, one who conquers in war; a vanquisher; one who\r\ndefeats an enemy in battle.\r\n\r\n=Victoria Cross.= The peculiarities of this decoration, which was\r\ninstituted on the termination of the Crimean campaign in 1856, are, that\r\nit may be granted to a soldier of any rank, and for a single act of\r\nvalor. The Cross of the Legion of Honor, as was felt during the Crimean\r\ncampaign, served a purpose in the French army which was served by none\r\nof the British decorations, and it was in imitation of it that the\r\nVictoria Cross was founded, with the inscription “For Valor,” and which\r\ncan be given to none but those who have performed, in presence of the\r\nenemy, some signal act of valor or devotion to their country. The\r\ngeneral distribution of the crosses earned in the Crimean war took place\r\nin Hyde Park on June 26, 1857. The recipients were 62 in number. The\r\nVictoria Cross is in the form of a Maltese cross, formed from the cannon\r\ncaptured at Sebastopol. In the centre is the royal crown, surmounted by\r\nthe lion, and below, on a scroll, the words, “For Valor.” The ribbon is\r\nblue for the navy, and red for the army. On the clasp are two branches\r\nof laurel, and from it the cross hangs, supported by the initial “_V_.”\r\nThe decoration is accompanied by a pension of £10 a year.\r\n\r\n=Victorious.= Belonging or relating to victory, or a victor; having\r\nconquered in battle or contest; having overcome an enemy; conquering;\r\nwinning; triumphant; as, a victorious general; victorious troops;\r\nvictorious army.

See\r\nAPPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 45.\r\n\r\n=Vienna.= A celebrated city of Europe, capital of the Austrian empire,\r\nis situated about 2 miles from the main stream of the Danube, 251 miles\r\nsoutheast of Prague by railway. Vienna was the Roman _Vindobona_. On the\r\ndecline of the Roman empire it experienced the common fate, and was\r\npillaged by the Goths and Huns. In the 13th century Vienna was subjected\r\nto a six weeks’ siege, in consequence of the refusal of Ottokar of\r\nBohemia (who was then in possession of Vienna) to acknowledge the\r\nelection of the emperor Rudolph. It was besieged by the Turks under\r\nSolyman the Magnificent, with an army of 300,000 men; but the defense,\r\nthough conducted by only about 16,000 regular troops, and 4000 citizens,\r\nwas so valiant that the Turks were forced to retire with the loss of\r\n70,000 of their best troops. In July, 1683, it was again besieged by the\r\nTurks, headed by the grand vizier Kara-Mustapha. The defense was most\r\nvaliantly conducted by Count Rudiger of Starhemberg, but had become\r\nalmost hopeless, when John Sobieski, king of Poland, suddenly appeared\r\nwith an army, and the Turkish host was almost annihilated, September 12,\r\n1683. Vienna was taken by the French under Prince Murat, November 14,\r\n1805; evacuated January, 1806; was again captured by the French, May 13,\r\n1809; but was restored on the conclusion of peace, October 14, 1809. The\r\nrevolt in Hungary induced an insurrection in Vienna, March 13, 1848. A\r\nsecond insurrection broke out, barricades were raised, and Count Latour,\r\nthe war minister, was murdered, October 6, 1848; the emperor took\r\nflight, October 7; and the city was bombarded by Windischgratz and\r\nJeliachich, October 28; it surrendered to the imperial troops on October\r\n30, having suffered considerably from the bombardment. The\r\nfortifications were demolished, and the city enlarged and beautified,\r\n1857-58. The Prussians encamped near Vienna, and a state of siege was\r\nproclaimed, July, 1866. The following treaties were concluded in Vienna:\r\n(1) The treaty between the emperor of Germany and the king of Spain, by\r\nwhich they confirmed to each other such parts of the Spanish dominions\r\nas they were respectively possessed of; and by a private treaty the\r\nemperor engaged to employ a force to procure the restoration of\r\nGibraltar to Spain, and to use means for placing the Pretender on the\r\nthrone of Great Britain. Spain guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction, April\r\n30, 1725. (2) Treaty of alliance between the emperor of Germany, Charles\r\nVI., George II., king of Great Britain, and the states of Holland, by\r\nwhich the Pragmatic Sanction was guaranteed, and the disputes as to the\r\nSpanish succession terminated (Spain acceded to the treaty on July 22).\r\nThis treaty was signed March 16, 1731. (3) Treaty of peace between the\r\nemperor Charles VI. of Germany and the king of France, Louis XV., by\r\nwhich the latter power agreed to guarantee the Pragmatic Sanction, and\r\nLorraine was ceded to France. Signed November 18, 1738. (4) Treaty\r\nbetween Napoleon I. and Francis (II. of Germany) I. of Austria, by which\r\nAustria ceded to France the Tyrol, Dalmatia, and other territories,\r\nwhich were shortly afterwards declared to be united to France under the\r\ntitle of the Illyrian Provinces, and engaged to adhere to the\r\nprohibitory system adopted towards England by France and Russia, October\r\n14, 1809. (5) Treaty between Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and\r\nPrussia, confirming the principles on which they had acted by the treaty\r\nof Chaumont, March 1, 1814. Signed March 23, 1815. (6) Treaty between\r\nthe king of the Netherlands on the one part and Great Britain, Russia,\r\nAustria, and Prussia on the other, agreeing to the enlargement of the\r\nDutch territories, and vesting the sovereignty in the house of Orange,\r\nMay 31, 1815. (7) Treaty by which Denmark ceded Swedish Pomerania and\r\nRugen to Prussia, in exchange for Lauenburg, June 4, 1815. (8)\r\nCommercial treaty for twelve years signed between Austria and Prussia.\r\nSigned at Vienna, February 19, 1853. (9) Treaty for the maintenance of\r\nTurkey, by the representatives of Great Britain, France, Austria, and\r\nRussia. Signed April 9, 1854. (10) Treaty between Austria, Prussia, and\r\nDenmark, by which Denmark ceded the duchies, October 30, 1864. (11)\r\nTreaty of peace between Austria and Italy; Venetia given up to Italy,\r\nOctober 3, 1866.\r\n\r\n=View of a Place.= A reconnoissance of a fortified town, its situation,\r\nthe nature of the country about it, as hills, valleys, rivers, marshes,\r\nwoods, hedges, etc.; taken in order to judge of the most convenient\r\nplace for opening the trenches, and carrying out the approaches; to find\r\nout proper places for encamping the army, and for the park of artillery.\r\n\r\n=Vigne= (_Fr._). In ancient times, a shed, or gallery with a roof and\r\nsides, made of double hurdles, 18 or 20 feet long, and 7 or 8 feet wide,\r\nupon wheels. Vignes were used to establish a covered communication\r\nbetween the towers, testudos, etc., of the besiegers.\r\n\r\n=Vigo.= A seaport town of Spain, in Galicia, situated on an inlet of the\r\nAtlantic called the Ria de Vigo, 78 miles southwest from Corunna. Vigo\r\nwas attacked and burned by the English under Drake and Norris in 1589.\r\nVigo was taken by Lord Cobham in 1719, but relinquished after raising\r\ncontributions. It was again taken by the British, March 27, 1809.\r\n\r\n=Vikings.= Scandinavian chiefs, Swedes, Danes, and Norsemen, who in the\r\n4th century migrated eastward, to the countries beyond the Baltic, and\r\nwestward and southward, chiefly to the British Isles.\r\n\r\n=Villafranca.= A town of Austrian Italy, in the delegation and 9 miles\r\nsouthwest from Verona, on the Tartaro. This place is remarkable for the\r\npersonal interview which took place here between the emperors of France\r\nand Austria, July 11, 1859, and the peace in consequence concluded, by\r\nwhich Lombardy was given to Sardinia.\r\n\r\n=Villages.= Cavalry, the better to preserve their horses, should occupy\r\nvillages whenever the distance of the enemy, and the time necessary to\r\nrepair to its posts in battle, will permit. Their quarters should be\r\npreferably farm-houses or taverns having large stables. Posts are\r\nestablished by the colonel or commanding officer, and the squadrons\r\nconducted to their quarters by their respective captains. Where in an\r\nexceptional case regular distributions are not made, the resources which\r\nthe household assigned as quarters presents are equally divided. About\r\ntwo hours after their arrival, the squadrons in succession water their\r\nhorses and then give forage. Cavalry, and infantry also, should,\r\nwherever thus cantoned near an enemy, occupy, when it can be done,\r\nhouses which will hold an entire company or some constituent fraction of\r\na company, and at break of day stand to their arms. When in the same\r\ncantonment, cavalry should watch over the safety of the cantonment by\r\nday and the infantry by night; and in the presence of an enemy they\r\nshould be protected by an advance guard and natural or artificial\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\n=Villa Viciosa.= A village of Spain, in New Castile, in the province of\r\nGuadalajara. Here, in 1710, was fought the battle which closed the War\r\nof Succession, and placed Philip V. upon the Spanish throne.\r\n\r\n=Villa Vicosa.= A town of Portugal, province of Alemtejo. Here the\r\nPortuguese under the French general Schomberg defeated the Spaniards,\r\n1665.\r\n\r\n=Villeta.= In Paraguay, South America, where Lopez and the Paraguayans\r\nwere totally defeated by the Brazilians and their allies, December 11,\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n=Vimeira.= A village of Portugal, in the province of Estremadura, 7\r\nmiles north from Torres Vedras. At this place the British under Sir\r\nArthur Wellesley defeated the French and Spanish forces under Marshal\r\nJunot, August 21, 1808. The attack made by the French with great bravery\r\nwas gallantly repulsed; it was repeated by Kellerman at the head of the\r\nFrench reserve, which was also repulsed, and the French being charged\r\nwith the bayonet, withdrew on all points in confusion, leaving many\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n=Vincennes.= A town of France, department of Seine, 5 miles\r\neast-southeast from the Louvre in Paris. In reality, the town is merely\r\na great fortress and barracks, and is famous for its arsenal, and for\r\nits school for the practice of shooting. At the latter the Chasseurs de\r\nVincennes, and all the best marksmen of the army, are trained. Among the\r\nfamous men who have been confined in this fortress may be mentioned\r\nHenry IV., the Prince of Condé, Cardinal de Retz, Mirabeau, and the Duc\r\nd’Enghein, who was shot in the moat of the castle by order of Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n=Vincent, St.= An island in the West Indies; it was long neutral, but at\r\nthe peace of 1703 the French agreed that the right to it should be\r\nvested in the English. The latter soon after engaged in a war against\r\nthe Caribs, on the windward side of the island, who were obliged to\r\nconsent to a peace. In 1779 the Caribs greatly contributed to the\r\nreduction of this island by the French, who, however, restored it in\r\n1783. In 1795 the French landed some troops, and again instigated the\r\nCaribs to insurrection, which was not subdued for several months.\r\n\r\n=Vincible.= Capable of being overcome or subdued; conquerable.\r\n\r\n=Vindelicia.= A Roman province south of the Danube, bounded on the north\r\nby the Danube which separated it from Germany, on the west by the\r\nterritory of the Helveti in Gaul, on the south by Rhætia, and on the\r\neast by the river Œnus (now _Inn_). It was originally part of the\r\nprovince of Rhætia, and was conquered by Tiberius in the reign of\r\nAugustus. The southern portion of this province was inhabited by the\r\nVindelici, a warlike people. The other tribes in Vindelicia were the\r\nBrigantii, the Licatii, and the Brunii. Vindelicia fell into the hands\r\nof the Alemanni in the 4th century, and from this time the population of\r\nthe country appears to have been entirely Germanized.\r\n\r\n=Vinegar.= In transportation by water vinegar is essential to the\r\ncomfort of horses, and should be freely used by sponging their mouths\r\nand noses repeatedly, and also their mangers. A small portion of vinegar\r\ndrank with water supplies the waste of perspiration of men in the field.\r\nIt is better than rum or whisky; it allays thirst, and men who use it\r\navoid the danger of drinking cold water when heated, and are not fevered\r\nas they are too apt to be by the use of spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\n=Vinegar-Hill.= Near Enniscorthy, in Wexford, Southeast Ireland. Here\r\nthe Irish rebels encamped and committed many outrages in the surrounding\r\ncountry. They were gradually surrounded by the British troops, commanded\r\nby Lake, June 21, 1798, and after a fierce struggle, with much\r\nslaughter, totally dispersed.\r\n\r\n=Violence.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR, 21 and 56.\r\n\r\n=Vireton= (_Fr._). An arrow formerly made very long, light, and so\r\nfeathered as to revolve round its own axis; also called vire.\r\n\r\n=Virginia.= One of the thirteen original United States of America, and\r\nis bounded on the north by Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia,\r\neast by Maryland and the Atlantic Ocean, south by North Carolina and\r\nTennessee, and west by Kentucky and West Virginia. The shores of\r\nVirginia were first explored by Sebastian Cabot, 1498, and again under\r\nthe auspices of Sir Walter Raleigh in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, in\r\nwhose honor it was named; was first settled by an English colony, on the\r\nJames River, May 13, 1607, which consisted mostly of gentlemen of\r\nfortune, and persons of no occupation. The friendly Indians sold them\r\nland and provisions; but the diseases of a damp climate swept off half\r\nthe settlers the first autumn. The energy of Capt. John Smith saved the\r\ncolony from destruction; and in 1609 it was reinforced by 500 persons,\r\nwho were reduced by sickness and starvation to 60. They had embarked to\r\nabandon the settlement, when Lord Delaware came with emigrants and\r\nsupplies. In 1622 the colony was reduced by wars and massacres from 4000\r\nto 2500; but in 1624 it became a crown colony, and increased, so that in\r\n1649 there were 15,000 English and 300 negroes in it. In 1754, the\r\ncolonial militia took part in the French war; and Maj. George Washington\r\ntook part in Gen. Braddock’s campaign. In 1769, Thomas Jefferson, a\r\nmember of the House of Burgesses, asserted for the colony the right of\r\nself-taxation, denying the right of Parliament to tax the colonies. In\r\n1773, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and Richard Henry Lee were\r\nappointed a committee to confer with the other colonies, and urged upon\r\ntheir delegates the Declaration of Independence. Virginia, the earliest\r\nsettled, largest, and most populous of the thirteen original States,\r\ncalled the Old Dominion, was the first to propose the confederacy and\r\nthe Constitution. On April 17, 1861, this State passed the ordinance of\r\nsecession. The Confederate government was invited to Richmond, which\r\nbecame the centre of military operations. Virginia was occupied by the\r\nFederal troops during the whole of the civil war, and a great many\r\nhotly-contested battles were fought on her soil. The State was restored\r\nto the Union, January 26, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Virginia, West.= A new State of the American Union, and separated from\r\nthe above, because antagonistic in political interests; it was organized\r\nin August, 1861, and admitted into the Union by act of Congress,\r\nDecember 31, 1862, taking effect June 20, 1863.

They are generally situated on a small hill,\r\noverlooking a considerable valley, and consist of a wall, which may have\r\noriginally been about 12 feet in height, inclosing a level area on the\r\nsummit of a hill. The most remarkable feature of these structures is,\r\nthat the wall is always more or less consolidated by the action of\r\nfire,--in some cases only giving a glassy coating to its inner side,\r\nwhile in other instances the vitrification has been most complete, the\r\nruins assuming the character of vast masses of coarse glass.\r\n\r\n=Vittoria.= A town of Spain, the chief town of the province of Alava, 30\r\nmiles southeast from Bilboa. This place is the site of a brilliant\r\nvictory obtained by Wellington over the French army commanded by Joseph\r\nBonaparte, king of Spain, and Marshal Jourdan, June 21, 1813. The\r\nhostile armies were nearly equal, from 70,000 to 75,000 each. After a\r\nlong and fearful battle, the French were driven, towards evening,\r\nthrough the town of Vittoria, and in their retreat were thrown into\r\nirretrievable confusion. The British loss was 22 officers and 479 men\r\nkilled; 167 officers and 2640 men wounded. Marshal Jourdan lost 151\r\npieces of cannon, 451 wagons of ammunition, all his baggage, provisions,\r\ncattle, and treasure, with his baton as marshal of France. Continuing\r\nthe pursuit on the 25th, Wellington took Jourdan’s only remaining gun.\r\n\r\n=Vivandière.= In continental armies, and especially that of France, a\r\nfemale attendant in a regiment, who sells spirits and other comforts,\r\nministers to the sick, marches with the corps, and contrives to be a\r\nuniversal favorite.

The woman wears the uniform of the\r\nregiment, short petticoats taking the place of the man’s tunic.\r\n\r\n=Vlissingen=, or =Flushing=. See FLUSHING.\r\n\r\n=Vocontii.= A powerful and important people in Gallia Narbonensis,\r\ninhabiting the southeastern part of Dauphiné, and a part of Provence.\r\nThey were allowed by the Romans to live under their own laws, and,\r\nthough in a Roman province, they were the allies and not the subjects of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n=Voided.= In heraldry, having the inner part cut away or left vacant, a\r\nnarrower border being left at the sides, the color of the field being\r\nseen in the vacant space;--said of a charge or ordinary.\r\n\r\n=Voider.= In heraldry, one of the ordinaries, whose figure is much like\r\nthat of the flanch or flasque.\r\n\r\n=Volant.= In heraldry, flying.

They lived under their own laws, without\r\nbeing subject to the Roman governor of the province, and they also\r\npossessed the Jus Latii. The Tectosages inhabited the western part of\r\nthe country from the Pyrenees as far as Narbo, and the Arecomici the\r\neastern part from Narbo to the Rhone. A portion of the Tectosages left\r\ntheir native country under Brennus, and were one of the three great\r\ntribes into which the Galatians in Asia Minor were divided.\r\n\r\n=Volhynia.= A frontier government of West Russia, bounded on the\r\nsouthwest by Galicia, and on the west by Poland, from which it is\r\nseparated by the river Bug.

Their language was nearly allied to the Umbrian. They were\r\nfrom an early period engaged in almost unceasing hostilities with the\r\nRomans, and were not completely subdued by the latter till 338 B.C.,\r\nfrom which time they disappear from history.\r\n\r\n=Volsinii=, or =Vulsinii= (now _Bolsena_). Called _Velsina_, or\r\n_Velsuna_, by the Etruscans, one of the most ancient and most powerful\r\nof the twelve cities of the Etruscan Confederation, was situated on a\r\nlofty hill on the northeastern extremity of the lake called after it,\r\n_Lacus Volsiniensis_ and _Vulsiniensis_ (now Lago di Bolsena). Volsinii\r\nis first mentioned in 392 B.C., when its inhabitants invaded Roman\r\nterritory, but were easily defeated by the Romans, and were glad to\r\npurchase a twenty years’ truce on humiliating terms. The Volsiniensis\r\nalso carried on war with the Romans in 311, 294, and 280, but were on\r\neach occasion defeated, and in the last of these years appear to have\r\nbeen finally subdued.

See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, TRAVELING KITCHEN, and TRAVELING\r\nFORGE.\r\n\r\n=Wagon-body, Ponton.= See PONTONS, WAGON-BODY PONTONS.\r\n\r\n=Wagoner.= One who conducts a wagon; a wagon-driver. The number of\r\nmaster-wagoners and wagoners allowed in the quartermaster’s department\r\nU. S. army is limited only by the exigencies of the service.\r\n\r\n=Wagon-master.= A person in charge of one or more wagons, especially of\r\nthose used for transporting freight, as the supplies of an army, and the\r\nlike. The quartermaster-general is authorized to employ from time to\r\ntime as many forage-masters and wagon-masters as he may deem necessary\r\nfor the service, not exceeding 20 in the whole, who shall be entitled to\r\nreceive $40 per month and three rations a day, and forage for one horse;\r\nand neither of whom shall be interested or concerned directly or\r\nindirectly in any wagon or other means of transport employed by the\r\nUnited States, nor in the purchase or sale of any property procured for\r\nor belonging to the United States, except as an agent of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n=Wagon-train.= An indispensable companion of an army under this or some\r\nother title. It serves to convey the ammunition, provisions, sick,\r\nwounded, camp equipage, etc. Wagons in convoy travel at a rate of from 1\r\nto 2 miles an hour, according to the state of the roads, and other\r\ncircumstances; and a mile may be said to contain 100 wagons. A great\r\nobject in the march of a convoy, is to preserve the draught animals as\r\nmuch as possible from fatigue. For this purpose, if the convoy amount to\r\nmany hundred wagons, they must be formed into divisions of not more than\r\n500 each. Should it consist of thousands, it will be advisable to form\r\nthem into grand divisions, and then again into subdivisions of 500 each.\r\nBy this means, and by calculating the time of departure, each division\r\nmay remain at rest until just before its time of movement, and the\r\nnecessity will thus be prevented of the latter part of a large convoy\r\nbeing harassed for a considerable time before its turn to move. The\r\ndifferent divisions of the convoy should be numbered, and obliged each\r\nday to change the order of their marching. Whenever the progress of a\r\nwagon-train is arrested by the breaking down of one of the wagons, or\r\nother delay, all the wagons in rear of the stoppage should immediately\r\ndrive up into the first open space, to as great a number as it will\r\nhold. This will keep the convoy together, and better under the care of\r\nthe escort. The escort should be divided into front, centre, and rear\r\nguards; besides the divisions in the flanks, which should never be more\r\nthan 400 yards from each other.\r\n\r\n=Wagram.= A village of Lower Austria, on the left bank of the Rossbach,\r\n11 miles northeast from Vienna. It is the site of a battle between the\r\nFrench under Napoleon, Davoust, Masséna, and Macdonald, and the\r\nAustrians under the Archduke Charles, in which the former were\r\nvictorious, July 5-6, 1809. The Austrians retreated in the most orderly\r\nmanner, carrying with them about 5000 prisoners, and leaving about\r\n25,000 dead or wounded on the field of battle,--the French loss being\r\nabout equal; the latter claim to have taken 20,000 prisoners.\r\n\r\n=Wahabees=, =Wahabis=, or =Wahabites=. A warlike Mohammedan reforming\r\nsect, considering themselves the only true followers of the Prophet,\r\narose in Arabia about 1750, under the rule of Abd-el-Nahab\r\n(Ibn-abdul-Wahab). His grandson Savoud (Saud, or Saood), in 1801,\r\ndefeated an expedition headed by the caliph of Bagdad. The conquest of\r\nHejaz was next undertaken by the Wahabees. In 1803, Saoud collected a\r\nlarge army, defeated Ghaleb, the ruler of Mecca, in several battles,\r\nlaid siege to Mecca, which, after a resistance of two or three months,\r\nsurrendered at discretion. Not the slightest excess was committed, but\r\nthe people had to become Wahabees. Failing to take Jiddah, into which\r\nGhaleb had thrown himself, the Wahabi forces went northwards, and, in\r\n1804, took Medina, where they stripped the tomb of Mohammed of its\r\naccumulated treasures, and prohibited the approach to it of all but\r\nWahabees. For several years after the conquest of Hejaz, Saoud continued\r\nto extend and consolidate his power. Plundering incursions were made to\r\nthe very vicinity of Bagdad, Aleppo, and Damascus. On the east, Saoud\r\ntook the island of Bahrein, and annexed a part of the Persian coast, on\r\nthe east side of the Gulf, and exacted tribute from the sultan of Oman.\r\nThis brought him into conflict with Great Britain, which sent (1808) a\r\nforce and severely chastised the Wahabi pirates that infested the\r\ncommerce of the Persian Gulf. Saoud’s son, Abdallah, long resisted\r\nMehemet Ali, pasha of Egypt, but in 1818 he was defeated and taken\r\nprisoner by Ibrahim Pasha, who sent him to Constantinople, where he was\r\nput to death. Ibrahim continued some months in Arabia, consolidating his\r\nconquests throughout Nejed and the adjoining provinces. But soon an\r\ninsurrection broke out, and the Egyptians had to retire to Kasim, and\r\nTurki, a son of Abdallah, was proclaimed sultan of Nejed. Renewed\r\nexpeditions were undertaken by the Egyptian commanders, driving, first,\r\nTurki from his capital for a time and then his son and successor,\r\nFeysul. But soon after the death of Mehemet Ali (1849) the Egyptians\r\ngave up the struggle; Feysul was recalled from exile; and under him and\r\nhis son Abdallah II., who unites in a high degree the fanaticism and\r\nferocity of the Wahabi, with great skill in military tactics, the Wahabi\r\nsway, according to the accounts of Palgrave in 1863, and of Col. Pelly\r\nin 1865, had become more powerful and extensive, and threatens to\r\nswallow up the entire peninsula.\r\n\r\n=Wahlstatt.= See KATSBACH.\r\n\r\n=Wait.= Ambush. _To lay wait_, to lie in ambush; to prepare an\r\nambuscade. _To lie in wait_, to lie in ambush; to be secreted in order\r\nto fall by surprise on an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Waiting, In.= This term is used in the British service, to mark out the\r\nperson whose turn is next for duty; as, an officer in waiting.\r\n_Field-officer in waiting_, is the term applied to the monthly duty\r\ntaken by the field-officers of the three regiments of Foot Guards, who\r\nattend the sovereign on court-days, to present the detail of his corps,\r\nand receive the parole or other orders from her personally, which are\r\nafterwards given to the guards in orders. The field-officer in waiting\r\ncommands all the troops on duty, and has the immediate care of the\r\nsovereign’s person within-doors, as the gold stick has of it while in\r\ncourt. The latter also receives the parole from the sovereign.\r\n\r\n=Waiving Amain.= A salutation of defiance, as by brandishing weapons,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n=Waiwode=, or =Waywode=. In the Turkish empire, the governor of a small\r\nprovince or town; a general.\r\n\r\n=Wakefield.= A town of England, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, 26\r\nmiles from York. Near it is the site of a battle between Margaret, the\r\nqueen of Henry VI., and the Duke of York, in which the latter was slain,\r\nand 3000 Yorkists fell upon the field, December 31, 1460. The death of\r\nthe duke, who aspired to the crown, seemed to fix the good fortune of\r\nMargaret; but the Earl of Warwick espoused the cause of the duke’s son,\r\nthe Earl of March, afterwards Edward IV., and the civil war was\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n=Walcheren.= An island of Holland, in the province of Zealand, in the\r\nGerman Ocean, at the mouth of the Scheldt. The unfortunate expedition of\r\nthe British to this isle in 1809 consisted of 35 ships of the line, and\r\n200 smaller vessels, principally transports, and 40,000 land forces, the\r\nlatter under the command of the Earl of Chatham, and the fleet under Sir\r\nRichard Strachan. For a long time the destination of the expedition\r\nremained secret; but before July 28, 1809, when it set sail, the French\r\njournals had announced that Walcheren was the point of attack. Perhaps\r\na more powerful and better appointed armament had never previously left\r\nthe British ports, or ever more completely disappointed public\r\nexpectation. The plan was to send the fleet and army up the Scheldt, and\r\nattack Antwerp (the principal naval station and arsenal in the north of\r\nFrance), whose fortifications, though formidable, were much in need of\r\nrepair, and whose garrison at the time only numbered about 2000 invalids\r\nand coast-guards; while there were not more than 10,000 French soldiers\r\nin Holland. The expedition, after numberless needless delays, at last\r\nsailed on July 28, and reached the Dutch coast on the following day.\r\nBut, instead of obeying the orders of the minister of war, Lord\r\nCastlereagh, to _advance at once in force against Antwerp_, the\r\ncommander-in-chief, Lord Chatham, frittered away his time in the\r\nreduction of Vlissingen (Flushing), which was not effected till August\r\n16, by which time the garrison of Antwerp had been reinforced by King\r\nLouis Bonaparte with the troops at his command (about 6000), and by\r\ndetachments sent from France, which swelled the garrison, by August 20,\r\nto 15,000 men. About the end of August, Chatham, who, as a general, was\r\na methodical incapable, “found himself prepared” to march upon Antwerp,\r\nbut by this time 30,000 men, under Bernadotte, were gathered to its\r\ndefense, and the English army was decimated by marsh-fever, so that\r\nsuccess was not to be hoped for. However, it was judged right to hold\r\npossession of Walcheren, in order to compel the French to keep a strong\r\nforce on the watch in Belgium, and, accordingly, 15,000 men remained to\r\ngarrison the island, the rest returned to England; but the malaria\r\nproved too fatal in its ravages, and as peace had been concluded between\r\nAustria and France, this force was also recalled. Thus an excellently\r\ndevised scheme, through utter stupidity of the agent chosen by royalty\r\nto carry it out, failed in every point of consequence, and ended in the\r\nloss of 7000 men dead, and the permanent disablement of half the\r\nremainder. The House of Commons instituted an inquiry, and Lord Chatham\r\nresigned his post of master-general of the ordnance, to prevent greater\r\ndisgrace; but the policy of the ministers in planning the expedition\r\nwas, nevertheless, approved.\r\n\r\n=Wales= (anc. _Britannia Secunda_). A principality in the southwest part\r\nof Great Britain. After the Roman emperor Honorius quitted Britain,\r\nVortigern was elected king of South Britain. He invited over the Saxons\r\nto defend his country against the Picts and Scots; but the Saxons\r\nperfidiously sent for reinforcements, consisting of Saxons, Danes, and\r\nAngles, by which they made themselves masters of South Britain. Many of\r\nthe Britons retired to Wales, and defended themselves against the\r\nSaxons, in their inaccessible mountains, about 447. In this state Wales\r\nremained unconquered till Henry II. subdued South Wales in 1157; and in\r\n1282, Edward I. entirely reduced the whole country, putting an end to\r\nits independence, by the death of Llewelyn, the last prince. The Welsh,\r\nhowever, were not entirely reconciled to this revolution, till the queen\r\ngave birth to a son at Caernarvon in 1284, whom Edward styled prince of\r\nWales, which title the heir to the crown of Great Britain has borne\r\nalmost ever since. For further history of Wales, see separate articles\r\nin this work.\r\n\r\n=Walk About.= A military expression used by British officers when they\r\napproach a sentinel, and think proper to waive the ceremony of being\r\nsaluted.\r\n\r\n=Wall.= A series of brick, stone, or other materials, carried upward and\r\ncemented with mortar. When used in the plural number, wall signifies\r\nfortification; works built for defense. _To be driven to the wall_, a\r\nfigurative term, signifying to be so pressed that you can neither\r\nadvance nor retreat.\r\n\r\n=Wallachia.= One of the Danubian principalities, in the northeast of\r\nTurkey in Europe. This country formed part of the ancient Dacia of the\r\nRomans, and was subsequently brought under the dominion of the Goths and\r\nHuns. During the two centuries which preceded the fall of the empire of\r\nthe East, it was sometimes subject to the Greek emperors, and sometimes\r\nto the monarchs of Hungary. It was conquered by the Turks in the 14th\r\ncentury, but the inhabitants struggled to assert their independence\r\nuntil 1536, when it became a province of the Ottoman empire. In 1829 it\r\nwas placed under the protection of Russia, though it was still\r\nconsidered a dependency of Turkey. See MOLDAVIA.\r\n\r\n=Walloon Guard.= The body-guard of the Spanish monarch;--so called\r\nbecause formerly consisting of Walloons.\r\n\r\n=Wall-piece.= A small cannon (or, in ancient times, an arquebuse)\r\nmounted on a swivel, on the wall of a fortress, for the purpose of being\r\nfired at short range on assailants in the ditch or on the covert way.\r\nThere are distinct evidences that the great wall of China was originally\r\nconstructed for the reception of wall-pieces.\r\n\r\n=Wandewash.= A town on the Coromandel coast, about 30 miles south of\r\nMadras. In 1739, when M. de Lally, the French governor in the East\r\nIndies, threatened with utter subjection the English settlements in the\r\nCarnatic, he was opposed most gallantly by Col. Coote, upon the\r\nCoromandel coast. Coote reduced the French settlements of Masulipatam\r\nand Conjeveram, and made a vigorous attack upon Wandewash, which he\r\ncaptured. Lally, in the autumn of 1739, made a bold attempt to regain\r\npossession of the disputed settlement, but his force was utterly broken;\r\nhe lost 600 men, and was happy to save the wreck of his army by\r\nabandoning his camp to the victor.\r\n\r\n=Wapinschaw.= A periodical gathering of the people, instituted by\r\nvarious Scots statutes, for the purpose of exhibiting their arms, these\r\nstatutes directing each individual to be armed on a scale proportionate\r\nto his property. There are numerous Scots acts of the 15th and 16th\r\ncenturies regulating the subject of wapinschaws. In the time of war or\r\nrebellion, proclamations were issued charging all sheriffs and\r\nmagistrates of burghs to direct the attendants of the respective\r\nwapinschawings to join the king’s host. During the reign of the later\r\nStuarts, attendance on the wapinschaws was enforced with considerable\r\nstrictness; and in addition to military exercises, sports and pastimes\r\nwere carried on by authority at these gatherings. The Covenanters, in\r\nconsequence of this sport being of a kind disapproved by them, did what\r\nthey could to discourage attendance on the wapinschaws.\r\n\r\n=War.= A contest between nations or states, carried on by force, either\r\nfor defense or for revenging insults and redressing wrongs, for the\r\nextension of commerce or acquisition of territory, or for obtaining and\r\nestablishing the superiority and dominion of one over the other. It is\r\nthe armed conflicts of sovereign powers, declared and open hostilities.\r\nWars are various in their occasions and objects; but in all cases, the\r\naim of each contending party is to weaken and overthrow the opposing\r\nparty. At one time, the art of war was supposed to consist very much in\r\nwearing out the enemy by a slow process of exhaustion, and thus wars\r\nwere much protracted. But more recently, the greatest generals have\r\nadopted the method of rather endeavoring to strike sudden and terrible\r\nblows, by which the war is sooner brought to a termination, and this\r\nmethod, although it may often have been adopted without regard to\r\nconsiderations of humanity, is, in all probability, less productive of\r\nsuffering to mankind than the other. Among rude nations, wars are\r\nconducted by tumultuary hosts, suddenly congregated, and in general,\r\neither after defeat or victory, soon dispersed. But the wars of the more\r\ncivilized and powerful nations have long been conducted by armies\r\ncarefully trained and disciplined; and in the case of maritime powers,\r\nby means of fleets at sea as well as of armies on land. Preparation for\r\nwar among such nations requires not only the forming and training of the\r\narmy, but vast provision in many various ways of the means and\r\n_matériel_ of war. Much science and skill are also applied to the\r\nconduct of military operations, and the principles upon which they ought\r\nto be conducted have been carefully investigated and theories tested by\r\nan examination of the history of the most important campaigns. See\r\nSTRATEGY and TACTICS.\r\n\r\nWars are classified in various ways. They are classified from the nature\r\nof the military operations employed in their prosecution; into\r\n_offensive_ or _defensive_ wars: from the end to be attained; into wars\r\nof _conquest_, wars of _independence_, etc.: from the causes producing\r\nthe war; into wars of _insurrection_, _religious_ wars, etc.: from the\r\ngeneral locality in which they are waged; into _American_, _African_,\r\n_European_, etc. Other classifications than these are also used, being\r\nbased on the nature and object of the war. War is both a _science_ and\r\n_an art_. All investigations which have for their object the\r\ndetermination of the great principles which should govern a general in\r\nconducting his military operations; all analyses which are made to show\r\nthe important and essential features which characterize a campaign or\r\nbattle, and comparisons made with other campaigns and battles; all\r\ndeductions and formations of rules which are to be used in military\r\noperations; all these belong to the _science_ of war. The practical\r\napplication of these great principles and rules belongs to the _art_ of\r\nwar. In the science of war as well as in the other physical sciences,\r\nthe facts must precede theory; and although the number of known facts is\r\nsteadily increasing, the number of general principles upon which the\r\ntheories of the science are based is constant, if not decreasing. These\r\ngeneral principles are deduced by a close and critical examination of\r\nsuch methods of waging war as have been adopted by those great generals\r\nwho are known as eminent in their profession. It is evident, then, that\r\nan intimate connection exists between military history and the science\r\nof war. Napoleon said, “Alexander made eight campaigns; Hannibal,\r\nseventeen,--one in Spain, fifteen in Italy, and one in Africa; Cæsar,\r\nthirteen, of which eight were against the Gauls and five against the\r\nlegions of Pompey; Gustavus Adolphus, three; Turenne, eighteen; Prince\r\nEugène of Savoy, thirteen; Frederick, eleven, in Bohemia, Silesia, and\r\non the banks of the Elbe. The history of these eighty-four campaigns,\r\nwritten with care, would be a complete treatise on the art of war. From\r\nthis source, the principles which ought to be followed, in offensive as\r\nwell as defensive warfare, could at once be obtained.” To these\r\ncampaigns are to be added the battles and campaigns of Napoleon. Jomini,\r\nan eminent writer on military art, says, “Correct theories, founded upon\r\nright principles, sustained by actual events of war, and added to\r\naccurate military history, will form a true school of instruction for\r\ngenerals.” If these means do not produce great men, they will at least\r\nproduce generals of sufficient skill to take rank next after the\r\n“natural masters of the art of war.” The sources of all treatises on the\r\n“Art and Science of War,” are to be found in the military histories\r\nnarrating the events and results of the battles and campaigns just\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of society, certain _usages of war_ have come to be\r\ngenerally recognized. These, of course, have varied at different times,\r\nand in different parts of the world, according to the state of\r\ncivilization and the prevalent feelings of the time. They are also\r\nsubject to modification from causes less general. But the changes which\r\nhave taken place in them during the lapse of ages have been in general\r\nfavorable to the interests of humanity. Prisoners of war are no longer\r\nput to death, nor are they reduced to slavery, as was once very\r\nfrequently the case, but their treatment has become generally more and\r\nmore mild and kind. It is a well-understood rule, however, that a\r\nprisoner of war obtaining his liberty by exchange or otherwise, with the\r\ncondition of not serving again during a fixed period against the same\r\npower, forfeits his life, if he is found so serving, and is again taken\r\nprisoner. Among all civilized nations, quarter is granted in battle\r\nwhenever it is sought; and there are certain usages universally\r\nprevalent with regard to the capitulation of fortified places, and of\r\nbodies of troops hopelessly hemmed in by superior forces, etc.\r\n\r\n=War, Articles of.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR.\r\n\r\n=War, Auxiliary.= Is that in which a nation succors its neighbors,\r\neither in consequence of alliances or engagements entered into with\r\nthem; or sometimes to prevent their falling under the power of an\r\nambitious prince.\r\n\r\n=War, Civil.= A war between different sections or parties of the same\r\ncountry or nation.\r\n\r\n=War, Council of.= See COUNCIL OF WAR.\r\n\r\n=War, Defensive.= Is a war undertaken to repel invasion or the attacks\r\nof an enemy. Defensive war may be divided into three kinds. It is either\r\na war sustained by a nation, which is suddenly attacked by another who\r\nis superior in troops and in means; or a nation makes this sort of war\r\nby choice on one side of its frontiers, while it carries on offensive\r\nwar elsewhere; or it is a war become defensive by the loss of a battle.\r\n\r\n=War Department.= See DEPARTMENT OF WAR.\r\n\r\n=War Establishment.= See ESTABLISHMENT.\r\n\r\n=War, Game of.= See STRATEGOS.\r\n\r\n=War, Holy.= A crusade; a war undertaken to deliver the Holy Land, or\r\nJudea, from infidels. See CRUSADE.\r\n\r\n=War Minister.= See MINISTER, and SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\n=War, Offensive.= See OFFENSIVE WAR.\r\n\r\n=War Office.= The immediate office of the British secretary of state for\r\nwar, and the centre on which pivots the entire administration of the\r\narmy. It is subdivided into a number of departments, each under a chief\r\nofficer, who is at the head of that section of the labor, and is\r\ndirectly responsible to the secretary of state. The last named high\r\nofficer is aided by two under-secretaries of state, an assistant\r\nunder-secretary, and a military assistant. Under these and the heads of\r\ndepartments there are about 450 clerks, with 50 messengers, etc.\r\n\r\n=War of Succession.= See SUCCESSION WARS.\r\n\r\n=War, Religious.= Is a war maintained in a state on account of religion,\r\none of the parties refusing to tolerate the other.\r\n\r\n=Warasdins.= A kind of Sclavonian soldiers, clothed like the Turks, with\r\na sugar-loaf bonnet instead of a hat.\r\n\r\n=War-beat=, or =War-beaten=. Worn down in service.\r\n\r\n=Warburg= (Northern Germany). Here the French were defeated by the Duke\r\nof Brunswick and the allies, July 31, 1760.\r\n\r\n=War-cry.= A cry or signal used in war. For mutual recognition and\r\nencouragement in battle, war-cries have always been common, each rude\r\nnation or tribe having its own. The ancient war-cry of the English was\r\n_Saint George!_ that of the Spaniards, _San Jago!_ and that of the\r\nFrench, _Montjoie Saint-Denis!_ that of the dukes of Burgundy, _Montjoie\r\nSaint-André!_ and that of the dukes of Bourbon, _Montjoie Notre-Dame!_.\r\nIn the feuds of the Middle Ages, each party, or the retainers of each\r\nnoble family, had a distinctive war-cry. Sometimes the war-cry was the\r\nname of the family. Thus, in Scotland, the retainers of the noble houses\r\nof Douglas and of Home rushed into battle with the cry of _A Douglas! a\r\nDouglas!_ or _A Home! a Home!_ The French armies under Napoleon were\r\naccustomed to charge with shouts of _Vive l’Empereur!_\r\n\r\n=Ward.= Watch, the act of guarding. A garrison or party stationed for\r\ndefense of any place; a position of defense or guard made by a weapon in\r\nfencing. Also, to guard; to watch; to defend; to parry an attack.\r\n\r\n=Ward-Burton Rifle.= See MAGAZINE GUNS.\r\n\r\n=War-dance.= A dance among savages preliminary to going to war. Among\r\nthe North American Indians, it is begun by some distinguished chief, and\r\nwhoever joins in it thereby enlists as one of the party engaged in a\r\nwarlike excursion. The war-dance is also indulged in upon the close of\r\nany successful expedition, as well as for pleasure.\r\n\r\n=Warden.= An officer appointed for the naval or military protection of\r\nsome particular district of country. In order to keep the districts of\r\nEngland adjoining to Scotland and Wales in an attitude of defense, great\r\nofficers, called _lord wardens_ of the marches, were appointed, to whom\r\nthe duty of protecting the frontier was committed. From this source\r\noriginated the name _ward_, applied to the subdivisions of the counties\r\nof Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham,--a term afterwards extended to\r\ndivisions of a city, town, or burgh adopted for municipal purposes. The\r\ncustodier of Dover Castle was created by William the Conqueror warden of\r\nthe Cinque Ports, and guardian of the adjacent coast, an office\r\ncomprising extensive jurisdiction, civil, naval, and military, the\r\ngreater part of which was taken away by 18 and 19 Vict., c. 48.\r\n\r\n=Warder.= A truncheon, or staff of command, carried by a king or any\r\ncommander-in-chief, the throwing down of which seems to have been a\r\nsolemn act of prohibition to stay proceedings.\r\n\r\n=Warfare.= Military service; military life; war; hostilities; contest\r\ncarried on by enemies.\r\n\r\n=Warfarer.= One engaged in warfare; a military man; a soldier.\r\n\r\n=War-field.= A field of war or battle.\r\n\r\n=War-horse.= A horse used in war; the horse of a cavalry soldier;\r\nespecially, a strong, powerful, spirited horse for military service; a\r\ncharger.\r\n\r\n=Warlike.= Fit for war; disposed for war; as, a warlike state. Belonging\r\nor relating to war; military; martial.\r\n\r\n=Warlike Virtues.= Are love of our country, courage, valor, prudence,\r\nintrepidity, temperance, disinterestedness, obedience, wisdom,\r\nvigilance, and patience. In the celebration of the anniversary of the\r\ndestruction of the Bastile, which took place at Paris July 14, 1789, the\r\nFrench characterized these eleven virtues by the following emblems: a\r\npelican, a lion, a horse, a stag, a wolf, an elephant, a dog, a yoked\r\nox, an owl, a cock, and a camel.\r\n\r\n=Warned.= Admonished of some duty to be performed at a given time or\r\nplace. Thus, officers and soldiers are warned for guard, etc.\r\n\r\n=War-paint.= Paint put on the face and other parts of the body by\r\nsavages, as a token of going to war.\r\n\r\n=War-path.= The route taken by a party going on a warlike\r\nexpedition,--usually applied to hostile Indians.\r\n\r\n=War-proof.= Valor tried by war.\r\n\r\n=Warrant.= A certificate of rank issued by commissioned officers. See\r\nOFFICERS, WARRANT-.\r\n\r\n=Warrant.= In Great Britain, is a royal ordinance on any matter relating\r\nto the army.\r\n\r\n=Warrington.= A town of England, in Lancashire, on the river Mersey, 17\r\nmiles east by south from Liverpool. As the best passage of the river, it\r\nwas the scene of frequent conflicts during the civil war in the reign of\r\nCharles I. In 1643 the town was twice taken by storm by the\r\nParliamentary forces. In 1648 the Scottish army made a stand here, but\r\nwere defeated by Gen. Lambert, who also here repulsed the troops under\r\nCharles II. on his way to Worcester in 1651; and in 1745 the centre\r\narches of the bridge, over the Mersey, were broken down to impede the\r\nprogress of the Highlanders under the Pretender.\r\n\r\n=Warrior.= A man engaged in war or military life; a soldier; a man noted\r\nfor valor and prowess; a champion.\r\n\r\n=Warsaw.= Formerly the capital of Poland, now capital of the Russian, or\r\nrather Russianized, government of Warsaw, on the left bank of the\r\nVistula, about 300 miles east of Berlin by railway. The Poles were\r\ndefeated in a three days’ battle by the Swedes, July 28-30, 1656. An\r\nalliance was formed here, between Austria and Poland against Turkey, in\r\npursuance of which John Sobieski assisted in raising the siege of Vienna\r\n(see VIENNA), March 31, 1683. Warsaw surrendered to Charles XII., 1703.\r\nA treaty was concluded here between Russia and Poland, February 24,\r\n1768. The Russians, placed here in 1794, were expelled by the citizens\r\nwith the loss of 2000 killed and 500 wounded, and 30 pieces of cannon,\r\nApril 17, 1794; the Poles were defeated, by the Russians at Maciejovice,\r\nnear Warsaw, October 4, 1794. The king of Prussia besieged Warsaw, July,\r\n1794; was compelled to raise the siege in September; but it was taken by\r\nthe Russians, November, 1794. On November 4, 1794, the Russian general\r\nSuwarrow, after the siege and destruction of Warsaw, cruelly butchered\r\n30,000 Poles, of all ages and conditions, in cold blood. In August,\r\n1807, Warsaw was constituted a duchy, and annexed to the house of\r\nSaxony. In 1813 the duchy was overrun by the Russians, and Warsaw made\r\nthe residence of a Russian viceroy. A Polish revolution commenced at\r\nWarsaw, November 29, 1830. The subsequent principal events in the\r\nhistory of this city being intimately connected with that of the state\r\nof which it was the capital, are narrated in the article Poland.\r\n\r\n=War-scot.= A contribution for the supply of arms and armor, in the time\r\nof the Saxons.\r\n\r\n=War-song.= A song exciting to war; especially, among the American\r\nIndians, a song at the war-dance, full of incitements to military ardor.\r\n\r\n=War-traitor.= A person who betrays to the enemy anything concerning the\r\ncondition, safety, operation, or plans of the troops holding or\r\noccupying a place. The punishment is usually death.\r\n\r\n=War-whoop.= The cry or shout uttered by Indians in war.\r\n\r\n=Warwickshire.= A county occupying almost the very heart of England, and\r\nthe centre and highest point of the great district of midland\r\ntable-land. At the time of the Roman invasion the county was inhabited\r\npartly by the Cornavii, and partly by the Wigantes, or Wiccii. Under the\r\nRomans it formed part of the province of Flavia Cæsariensis. Under the\r\nSaxons, the county was included in the kingdom of Mercia, whose rulers\r\noccasionally resided at Warwick, Tamworth, and Kingsbury. After the\r\nConquest, the powerful families, the Newburghs, Beauchamps, and\r\nNevilles, who held the earldom of Warwick, involved the county in all\r\nthe great civil wars recorded in English history. In the troubles in\r\nHenry III.’s reign, Kenilworth stood a long siege by the royal forces;\r\nin the wars of the Roses, the city of Coventry warmly embraced the\r\nLancastrian, and the town of Warwick the Yorkist cause; and in the war\r\nbetween Charles I. and his Parliament, Warwickshire was torn by the\r\ncontending factions, who made special head in the neighborhood of\r\nBirmingham. Charles slept at Aston Hall, near that town, on his march\r\nthrough Warwickshire in 1642, and two days afterwards the first great\r\nbattle of the civil war was fought on the borders of the county at Edge\r\nHill. Swords and other weapons, used in the battle, are still\r\noccasionally plowed up. Maxstoke Castle (inhabited) is externally a\r\nremarkably perfect specimen of the fortified residences of the period of\r\nthe 14th century.\r\n\r\n=Warwolf.= In ancient military history, an engine for throwing stones\r\nand other great masses.\r\n\r\n=War-worn.= Worn with military service; as, a war-worn soldier.\r\n\r\n=Washington City.= The seat of the government of the United States of\r\nAmerica, is in the District of Columbia, on the left bank of the Potomac\r\nRiver, between Anacostia River and Rock Creek, which separates it from\r\nGeorgetown, 39 miles southwest from Baltimore, and 120 miles northeast\r\nfrom Richmond. This city was commenced in 1793, but operations were\r\nsubsequently suspended in consequence of the war, and much that had been\r\ndone was destroyed by the British in 1814, so that the whole edifice was\r\nrecommenced in 1815, and was not entirely finished till 1828. During the\r\ncivil war (1861-65), from its exposed position, it was threatened with\r\ncapture, and was surrounded with fortifications, and converted into an\r\nintrenched camp.\r\n\r\n=Washington Territory.= A Territory of the United States; bounded north\r\nby British Columbia, east by the Territory of Idaho, south by the\r\nColumbia River, which separates it from Oregon, and west by the Pacific\r\nOcean. This Territory was discovered by Juan de Fuca, a Greek, in 1592;\r\nvisited by a Spanish navigator in 1775, and three years after by Capt.\r\nCook. In 1787, Berkeley, an Englishman, re-discovered the Strait of\r\nFuca, which had been missed by the others. Settlements were made in this\r\nTerritory by the Hudson Bay Company in 1828; in 1845, American settlers\r\nentered the Territory, then a part of Oregon. Wars with the Indians, in\r\n1855 and 1858, retarded immigration, but in the latter year, 15,000\r\npersons were attracted by gold discoveries. This Territory was organized\r\nin 1853.\r\n\r\n=Wat Tyler’s Insurrection.= See TYLER’S INSURRECTION.\r\n\r\n=Watch.= The non-commissioned officers and men on board of transports\r\nare divided into three watches, one of which is constantly to be on\r\ndeck, with at least one subaltern officer in charge of the watch.\r\n\r\n=Watch and Ward.= The charge or care of certain officers to keep a watch\r\nby night and a guard by day in towns, cities, and other districts, for\r\nthe preservation of the public peace.\r\n\r\n=Watch-tower.= A tower on which a sentinel is placed to watch for\r\nenemies or the approach of danger.\r\n\r\n=Watch-word.= See PAROLE.\r\n\r\n=Water.= In calculating the quantity of water required per man for\r\ndrinking and cooking, it may be put down at 6 pints in temperate, and 8\r\npints in tropical climates. A similar amount will just allow men to wash\r\ntheir bodies. In stationary camps, however, the minimum daily allowance\r\nper man should be 5 gallons for all purposes, washing clothes included.\r\nHorses not doing work will thrive well on 6 gallons a day, but require\r\nfrom 8 to 12 when at work, according to their condition and the nature\r\nof the work. A couple of gallons extra should, under all circumstances,\r\nbe allowed for washing them. Oxen require about 6 or 7 gallons daily.\r\n\r\nIn selecting positions, particularly those that are likely to be of a\r\npermanent character, a careful analysis of the water should be made by a\r\nmedical man. A fair opinion can be formed as to whether it is wholesome\r\nor not, by the appearance of the inhabitants, and by tasting the water\r\noneself. “It should be transparent, colorless, without odor, and\r\ntasteless; well aërated, cool, and pleasant to drink; it must have no\r\ndeposit; vegetables should be easily cooked in it.” Shallow water is\r\nalways to be examined with suspicion. The water of some rivers at\r\ncertain seasons is thick and muddy; in some, it is always so. To examine\r\nit without the aid of chemical tests, fill a long tumbler or other glass\r\nvessel with it. If the water has been drawn in a bucket or other vessel,\r\nshake it up and stir it well before pouring it into the tumbler or glass\r\ncylinder; let it stand for a day, or as many hours as possible; draw off\r\nthe water without disturbing the sediment, which should then be\r\ncarefully examined through a microscope. Vegetable decompositions and\r\niron are the chief substances that give color to water. When water is\r\nvery bad it should be boiled before drinking; after boiling it should be\r\nplaced in shallow vessels, and poured from a height from one into\r\nanother. Very muddy water when placed in barrels or other vessels, can\r\nbe cleaned by immersing the hand containing a lump of alum in it, and\r\nmoving it about for a few seconds. All the coloring matter will sink to\r\nthe bottom. The longer the time that elapses between the operation and\r\ndrinking, the better. Growing vegetable substances may not be always\r\ninjurious, but dead vegetable matter is so without doubt. At the maximum\r\ndensity (39.8° Fahr.), the barometer being at 30 inches, a gallon of\r\ndistilled water weighs 8.33888 avoirdupois pounds or 58,373 grains.\r\n\r\n=Water-battery.= One nearly on a level with the water.\r\n\r\n=Water-bucket.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Water-budget.= A heraldic bearing, in the form of a yoke with two\r\npouches of leather appended to it, originally intended to represent the\r\nbags used by the Crusaders to convey water across the desert, which\r\nwere slung on a pole, and carried across the shoulders. The Trusbuts,\r\nbarons of Wartre in Holderness, bore _Trois boutz d’eau_, “_three\r\nwater-budgets_,” symbolizing at once their family name and baronial\r\nestate; and by the marriage of the heiress, similar arms came to be\r\nassumed by the family of De Ros, who bear gules, three water-budgets\r\nargent.\r\n\r\n=Water-deck.= A covering of painted canvas for the saddle, bridle, and\r\nthe like, of a dragoon’s horse.\r\n\r\n=Waterford.= A maritime county of the province of Munster, in Ireland.\r\nIn the time of Ptolemy, it was inhabited by the tribe of the Brigantes.\r\nIt was afterwards peopled by the Desii, who are supposed to have\r\nmigrated from a tribe of the same name in Meath; and having spread\r\nthemselves also over the plain country of Tipperary; those settled in\r\nWaterford were distinguished by the name of South Desii, and the others\r\nby that of North Desii. Here the Danes established a permanent\r\nsettlement in the 9th century, making the city of Waterford their chief\r\nseat of government; and though frequently involved in wars with the\r\nsurrounding natives, they retained possession of the city and district\r\nuntil their subjugation by the English, who, in 1170, under Strongbow,\r\nstormed Waterford, took their chieftain or prince prisoner, and brought\r\nthe whole of the Desiis into the possession of the English. Shortly\r\nafter, Henry II. granted the greater part of the county to Robert le\r\nPoer, and the remainder, with that of Cork, then a petty kingdom, to\r\nMilo de Cogan, two of his followers. King John landed at Waterford in\r\n1211, and personally visited many parts of the country. The next king of\r\nEngland who visited Ireland, Richard II., landed at Waterford in 1394,\r\nwith an army of 4000 men-at-arms, and 30,000 archers. The county\r\nsuffered severely in the reign of Elizabeth, through the rebellion of\r\nthe Earl of Desmond, and the Spanish invasion; and also in the wars of\r\n1641, during the first years of which, its possession was the subject of\r\ncontinued sanguinary contention between the English and Irish forces,\r\nuntil it was ultimately reduced under the authority of the English\r\nParliament by Cromwell. During the war of the Revolution, it took part\r\nwith King James, and was reduced by King William’s forces, under Gen.\r\nKirk, after the decisive battle of the Boyne.\r\n\r\n=Watering-bucket.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Watering-call.= A trumpet sounding, on which the cavalry assemble to\r\nwater their horses.\r\n\r\n=Waterloo.= A village of Belgium, province of South Brabant, on the\r\nhighway from Charleroi to Brussels; which was the scene of the greatest\r\nand most decisive battle of modern times. This battle was fought on June\r\n18, 1815, between the French army of 71,947 men and 246 guns, under\r\nNapoleon, and the allies, commanded by the Duke of Wellington; the\r\nlatter with 67,661 men and 156 guns, resisted the various attacks of the\r\nenemy from 10 o’clock in the morning until 5 o’clock in the afternoon.\r\nAbout that time 16,000 Prussians reached the field of battle; and by 7\r\no’clock, the force under Blücher amounted to above 50,000 men, with 104\r\nguns. Wellington then moved forward his whole army, and in every point\r\nthis attack succeeded. The French were forced from their positions, and\r\nfled in the utmost confusion, leaving 227 pieces of artillery in the\r\nhands of the victors. The pursuit was kept up with great energy\r\nthroughout the whole night by the Prussian troopers, who seemed bent\r\nupon at once avenging the defeats of Jena, Auerstadt, and Ligny, and\r\nglutted their fierce animosity by an indiscriminate slaughter. The total\r\nloss in this battle was, from the obstinacy and determination with which\r\nit was contested, necessarily large; the figures are: British and\r\nHanoverians, 11,678; Brunswickers, 687; Nassauers, 643; Netherlanders,\r\n3178; a total of 16,186; which added to 6999 Prussians, gives the\r\naggregate allied loss, 23,185. The French had 18,500 killed and wounded,\r\nand 7800 prisoners (some French accounts raise the total list of _hors\r\nde combat_ to 32,000). Napoleon, quitting the wreck of his flying army,\r\nreturned to Paris; and, finding it impossible to raise another,\r\nabdicated the throne of France.\r\n\r\n=Wattignies.= A village of France, department of Nord, where Jourdan and\r\nthe French republicans defeated the Austrians under the Prince of\r\nCoburg, and raised the siege of Maubeuge, October 14-16, 1793.\r\n\r\n=Waver.= A body of troops is said to waver when it becomes unsteady if\r\nat the halt, or to hesitate and lose its order if on the march, under\r\nthe fire of the enemy.\r\n\r\n=Wavre.= A town in the province of South Brabant, Belgium. It is known\r\nas the scene of a desperate and protracted conflict between the French\r\nand Prussians, on June 18-19, 1815. The former under Grouchy, Gérard,\r\nand Vandamme, advanced against the Prussians at the same time as\r\nNapoleon directed the troops under his immediate orders against\r\nWellington at Waterloo, and being much superior in number (32,000 to\r\n15,200), drove the Prussians under Thielman into Wavre, where they\r\ndefended themselves with desperate firmness, repulsing thirteen\r\ndifferent assaults in the course of the 18th. On the following morning,\r\nThielman, who had heard of the victory at Waterloo, attacked Grouchy,\r\nbut was repulsed with vigor, though the urgent orders of Napoleon forced\r\nthe latter to retreat to Laon, instead of following up his success.\r\n\r\n=Wawz=, or =Wawer= (Poland). The Poles under Skrzynecki attacked the\r\nRussians at Wawz, and after two days’ hard fighting, all the Russian\r\npositions were carried by storm, and they retreated with the loss of\r\n12,000 men and 2000 prisoners, March 31, 1831. The loss of the Poles\r\nwas small, but their triumph was soon followed by defeat and ruin.\r\n\r\n=Way, Covert.= See COVERT WAY.\r\n\r\n=Way of the Rounds.= In fortification, a space left for the passage of\r\nthe rounds between the rampart and the wall of a fortified town.\r\n\r\n=Waywode.= A Slavic word meaning “leader in war,” was first applied\r\nsimply to the military commanders, but afterward also to the governors\r\nof the provinces, and used in Poland, Hungary, Transylvania, Moldavia,\r\nand Wallachia. It has been superseded by another title, also of Slavic\r\norigin,--_hospodar_.\r\n\r\n=Weapon.= An instrument of offensive or defensive combat; something to\r\nfight with; anything used, or designed to be used, in destroying or\r\nannoying an enemy.\r\n\r\n=Weaponed.= Furnished with weapons or arms; armed; equipped.\r\n\r\n=Weaponless.= Having no weapons; unarmed.\r\n\r\n=Wear and Tear.= Said of military stores which have been worn out in\r\nservice; as, the equipments were rendered useless by the wear and tear\r\nof service.\r\n\r\n=Wednesfield.= A parish of England, in Staffordshire. Edward the Elder\r\ngained a victory over the Danes near this place in the beginning of the\r\n10th century.\r\n\r\n=Well.= A depth which the miner sinks under ground, with branches or\r\ngalleries running out from it, either to prepare a mine, or to discover\r\nthe enemy’s mine.\r\n\r\n=Well Found.= Fully equipped.\r\n\r\n=Werder Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Werndl Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS.\r\n\r\n=Westmorland=, or =Westmoreland=. One of the lake counties of England,\r\nbounded by Cumberland on the northwest and north, by Durham and\r\nYorkshire on the east, and by Lancashire on the south and west. Its\r\nearliest inhabitants, as far as any traces remain, were principally,\r\nthough not exclusively, Celts of the Cambrian division. Early in the 2d\r\ncentury this part of England was overrun by the Romans, who established\r\ntheir power by means of numerous forts and well-constructed roads. From\r\nthe withdrawal of the Romans to the coming in of the Angles and the\r\nDanes the history of Westmorland is a complete blank. The invasion of\r\nthe former people, who appear to have penetrated along the lines of the\r\nRoman roads, probably commenced about the close of the 7th century, and\r\nsoon after the Northmen, when driven from the other parts of England,\r\ntook refuge in this country. Westmorland, with other northern counties,\r\nwas either held or claimed during some centuries by Scotland, and thus\r\ncontinued for a long time a cause of contention between the two\r\ncountries; but in 1237 the king of Scotland was induced to give up his\r\nclaim to it. From this time to the period of the civil war of the reign\r\nof Charles I. Westmorland enjoyed comparative tranquillity. In 1648,\r\nSir Marmaduke Langdale raised a force of upwards of 4000 men, chiefly in\r\nCumberland and Westmorland. They were joined by the Scots, who remained\r\nin the latter county until they were compelled to remove out of it for\r\nwant of provisions; and during their stay, and until the final retreat\r\nof the royalists, this district was reduced to extreme distress. In 1715\r\nthe adherents of the Stuart family passed through Westmorland on their\r\nway to Preston. And again in 1745, Prince Charles, with his Highland\r\nfollowers, marched through the county in his invasion of England. During\r\nthe retreat of this ill-fated expedition, in December of the same year,\r\nthe rear of the Highlanders was overtaken by the Duke of Cumberland’s\r\nhorse on Clifton Moor, when a sharp skirmish ensued, which checked the\r\nadvance of the English for the moment, and hastened the retreat of the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\n=Westphalia=, or =Munster, Peace of=. Was signed at Munster and at\r\nOsnaburg, between France, the emperor, and Sweden; Spain continuing the\r\nwar against France. By this peace the principle of a balance of power in\r\nEurope was first recognized; Alsace given to France, and part of\r\nPomerania and some other districts to Sweden; the elector palatine\r\nrestored to the Lower Palatinate; the religious and political rights of\r\nthe German states established; and the independence of the Swiss\r\nConfederation recognized by Germany, October 24, 1648.\r\n\r\n=West Point.= Site of the United States Military Academy, and of a\r\nfortress erected during the war of Independence, on the right bank of\r\nthe Hudson River, 52 miles north of the city of New York. The Military\r\nAcademy is on a plain 160 to 180 feet above the river, surrounded by the\r\nbold scenery of one of the finest river-passes in the world. The forts\r\nand a river-chain were taken by the British in 1777, but abandoned after\r\nBurgoyne’s surrender, and stronger forts were built, which Gen. Arnold\r\nbargained to betray,--a plot foiled by the arrest of Maj. André. For\r\nhistory of the Military Academy at West Point, see MILITARY ACADEMIES.\r\n\r\n=West Virginia.= See VIRGINIA, WEST.\r\n\r\n=Wexford.= A maritime county of the province of Leinster, Ireland. The\r\nmaritime position of Wexford laid it open early to the incursions of the\r\nDanes, to whom the name Wexford, or Weisford, is traced by antiquaries.\r\nIt was the first landing-place of the English in the invasion, and\r\nformed part of the tract granted by MacMurrough to the English\r\nadventurers whose assistance he had invoked. During the civil wars which\r\nfollowed 1641, Wexford was the scene of frequent contests; and in the\r\nmore recent insurrection of 1798, it formed the theatre of the only\r\nformidable conflicts of the peasantry with the regular troops.\r\n\r\n=Wheel.= See ORDNANCE, CARRIAGES FOR, THE CAISSON.\r\n\r\n=Wheel, To.= In tactics, to move forward or backward in a circular\r\nmanner, round some given point. Wheeling is one of the most essential\r\nand important operations of the company, necessary in many changes of\r\nposition, and in the formation of column and of the line.\r\n\r\n=Wheelings.= Different circular motions made by horse and foot, either\r\nto the right or left, forward and backward, etc.\r\n\r\n=Wheel-lock.= A sort of lock anciently used on arquebuses. It consisted\r\nof a roughened steel wheel, with chain and spring, which, when wound up\r\nlike a watch, revolved rapidly, and struck fire against a flint held in\r\nthe cock.\r\n\r\n=Whinyard.= A sword, or hanger, so called by Butler in his “Hudibras.”\r\n\r\n=Whipping.= See FLOGGING.\r\n\r\n=White Eagle, Order of the.= An order of knighthood in Poland,\r\ninstituted by Vladislaus V. in 1325; revived by Frederick Augustus I. in\r\n1705.\r\n\r\n=White Feather.= A mark of cowardice. _To show the white feather_, to\r\ngive indications of cowardice.\r\n\r\n=White Gunpowder.= See GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\n=White Plains.= A village of Westchester Co., N. Y., 25 miles\r\nnorth-northeast of New York. A noted battle of the Revolution was fought\r\nin the vicinity, October 28, 1776, between the Americans and the\r\nBritish, in which the former were worsted.\r\n\r\n=Whiteboys.= A body of ruffians in Ireland, so called on account of\r\ntheir wearing linen frocks over their coats. They committed dreadful\r\noutrages in 1761, but were suppressed by a military force, and their\r\nringleaders executed in 1762. They rose into insurrection again and were\r\nsuppressed 1786-87. Whiteboys have appeared at various times since,\r\ncommitting the most frightful crimes. The insurrection act was passed on\r\ntheir account in 1822.\r\n\r\n=Whitworth Gun.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Whiz.= To make a humming or hissing sound, like an arrow or ball flying\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\n=Who Comes There?= The night challenge of a sentinel on post.\r\n\r\n=Whoop.= A shout; a loud noise which soldiers make in charging. It is a\r\nnatural though a barbarous habit, and has been preserved in civilized\r\narmies from a prevailing custom among savages, particularly the wild\r\nIndians of America.\r\n\r\n=Wicket.= A small door in the gate of a fortified place, affording a\r\nfree passage to the people without opening the great gate.\r\n\r\n=Wicklow.= A maritime county in the province of Leinster, in Ireland.\r\nAccording to Ptolemy the geographer, the northern part of the county was\r\nthe residence of the tribe of the Cauci, and the southern that of the\r\nMenapii. It was afterwards occupied by the Irish septs of the Byrnes and\r\nO’Tooles, who, though the district was claimed by the English after\r\ntheir settlement, maintained their independence, and carried on an\r\nalmost continual war against the new settlers until the end of the reign\r\nof Elizabeth. The inhabitants adhered to the royal cause during the war\r\nof 1641, until the arrival of Cromwell, to whose superior force they\r\nsubmitted without opposition. No other occurrences of historical\r\nimportance took place until 1798, when several bands of insurgents\r\nsought refuge in the mountain fastnesses after the dispersion of their\r\nmain body in Wexford, and continued to harass the neighboring counties\r\nuntil tranquillity was restored, partly by making terms with the\r\nleaders, and partly by establishing military posts in the interior of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n=Widdin=, or =Widin=. A fortified town of European Turkey. It is\r\nsurrounded on the land side by morasses, and is defended by a strong\r\ncitadel, by walls, and by a fortified island in the Danube. For\r\ncenturies it has been a strong post in all the contests between the\r\nTurks and their northern neighbors, and it is called by the Turks the\r\nVirgin Fort, from its never having been taken.\r\n\r\n=Wield.= To use with full command or power, as a thing not heavy for the\r\nholder; to manage; to handle; as, to wield a sword.\r\n\r\n=Wiesbaden.= A town of Prussia, formerly capital of the independent\r\nduchy of Nassau. The Romans built a station here, and erected a fort on\r\na hill on the northwest side of the town, still known as the Römerberg,\r\nand which was garrisoned by the 22d Roman legion. The _Mattiaci_, a\r\nsubdivision of the German tribe called the _Catti_, allied themselves\r\nwith the Romans; but in the 3d century, the barbarian Germans rose\r\nagainst the Romans, and destroyed their forts, including Wiesbaden.\r\n\r\n=Wigan.= A town of England, in Lancashire, situated near the small river\r\nDouglas. In the civil war the king’s troops, commanded by the Earl of\r\nDerby, were defeated and driven out of the town in 1643 by the\r\nParliamentary forces under Sir John Smeaton. The earl was again defeated\r\nby Ashton, who razed the fortifications of Wigan to the ground in the\r\nsame year; and once more by a greatly superior force commanded by Col.\r\nLilburne, 1651.\r\n\r\n=Wight, Isle of= (anc. _Vecta_, or _Vectis_). An island in the English\r\nChannel, lying off the coast of Hampshire, from which it is separated by\r\nthe Solent. It was originally peopled by the Celts, who were afterwards\r\nexpelled or subdued by the Belgæ and these, in their turn, were\r\ncompelled to submit, in 43, to the Roman legions under Vespasian. The\r\nSaxon kings of Wessex conquered it about 530, after a sanguinary action\r\nat Wiht-garasbyrig, supposed to be the modern Carisbrooke. In 661, it\r\nwas subdued by Wulfhere, son of Penda, king of Mercia. The Danes invaded\r\nthe Wight in 787, 897, 981, 998, and again in 1003, when they destroyed\r\nthe town of Waltham, supposed to be identical with the modern Werror.\r\nThe French landed on the island, but were repulsed in 1340. In 1377,\r\nthe French burnt the towns of Yarmouth, Newtown, and Newport, but were\r\ndefeated in an attack which they hazarded upon Carisbrooke Castle. In\r\n1545, the French forces, which had assembled under Claude d’Annebault,\r\nand fought an indecisive action with Lord Lisle at Spithead, threw\r\nthemselves upon the island in four detachments at Sea View, Bembridge,\r\nShanklin, and Bonchurch, but were repulsed with signal loss.\r\n\r\n=Wigwam= (sometimes written _weekwam_). An Indian cabin or hut. The\r\nwigwam, or Indian house, of a circular or oval shape, was made of bark\r\nor mats laid over a framework of branches of trees stuck in the ground\r\nin such a manner as to converge at the top, where was a central aperture\r\nfor the escape of smoke from the fire beneath. The better sort had also\r\na lining of mats. For entrance and egress two low openings were left on\r\nopposite sides, one or the other of which was closed with bark or mats,\r\naccording to the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\n=Wilderness, Battles of the.= Were fought between the Federal and\r\nConfederate armies in Virginia, in May, 1864. They consisted of a series\r\nof sanguinary battles, having for their object the capture of Richmond.\r\nThe plan of Gen. Grant, commander-in-chief of the Union forces, was to\r\nfollow a line nearly corresponding to the route of the Fredericksburg\r\nand Richmond Railroad, making his base at Acquia Creek. For this purpose\r\nhe moved down the right of the position of Gen. Lee, who commanded the\r\nConfederate army, and was prepared either to accept a battle from him on\r\nthe Rapidan, or to continue his march to Spottsylvania Court-house. Gen.\r\nLee would not consent to be outflanked, and thereby endanger his\r\nrailroad communication with Richmond. He therefore prepared to resist\r\nthe progress of Grant, and commenced a rapid movement of his forces\r\nparallel with the course of the river. Gen. Hill’s and Ewell’s forces\r\narrived in front of Gen. Grant’s forces on Thursday, May 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 5th, Grant’s command began to move. The 5th\r\nCorps (Warren’s) advanced from its position near Wilderness Tavern,\r\nalong the roads leading to Orange Court-house, 5 miles to Parker’s\r\nstore. This point is in Spottsylvania County, about 8 miles above\r\nChancellorsville. The whole face of the country in that neighborhood is\r\nthickly covered with an undergrowth of field-pines, cedars, and\r\nscrub-oaks, and therefore utterly unfit for the use of cavalry or\r\nartillery. The 6th Corps (Sedgwick’s) was to follow, and the 2d Corps\r\n(Hancock’s) was to stretch southwesterly from Chancellorsville toward\r\nShady Grove Church. Sheridan covered the extreme left, with the object\r\nof finding the enemy’s cavalry under Stuart. This line extended nearly 5\r\nmiles, with the centre thrown forward, when the action commenced. The\r\n5th Corps and the advance of the enemy under Ewell met, when a fierce\r\nencounter ensued, the Federals losing about 1000 men. At different\r\nperiods during the afternoon other portions of the opposing armies came\r\nin contact, and the contest became exceedingly bloody. Such was the\r\nnature of the undergrowth that there was little opportunity to use\r\nartillery. The fire of the enemy’s musketry was furious, and continued\r\nuntil late in the night, but the Federal line was substantially as it\r\nhad been when the battle commenced; both armies were still face to face,\r\nready to attack at dawn on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Wilderness was renewed on May 6, and consisted of a\r\nsuccession of fierce attacks made by each side. Both had more or less\r\nintrenched their positions by felling timber and covering it with earth,\r\nor slight earthworks. The interval of ground between the opposing lines\r\nwas fought over in some places as many as four or five times, the\r\ncombatants driving each other in turn from the opposite lines of\r\nrifle-pits, and the battle continued with unabated fury until darkness\r\nset in, each army holding substantially the same position that they had\r\non the evening of the 5th. After dark, the enemy made a feeble attempt\r\nto turn our right flank, but the promptness of Gen. Sedgwick, who was\r\npersonally present and commanding that part of the line, frustrated\r\ntheir object. During these two days, the total loss was estimated at\r\n15,000. On the morning of the 7th, reconnoissances showed that the enemy\r\nhad fallen behind his intrenched lines, with pickets to the front,\r\ncovering a part of the battle-field. Gen. Grant determined to move by\r\nhis right flank, and put his whole force between Lee’s forces and\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 7th the march was commenced toward Spottsylvania\r\nCourthouse, the 5th Corps moving on the most direct road. But Lee having\r\nbeen apprised of the movement, and having the shorter line, was enabled\r\nto reach there first, and the battles of Spottsylvania followed, which\r\nare given below.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th, Gen. Warren met a force of the enemy, which had been sent\r\nout to oppose and delay his advance, to gain time to fortify the line\r\ntaken up at Spottsylvania. This force was steadily driven back on the\r\nmain force, within the recently-constructed works, after considerable\r\nfighting, resulting in severe loss to both sides. On the morning of the\r\n9th Gen. Sheridan started on a raid against the enemy’s lines of\r\ncommunication with Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe 9th, 10th, and 11th were spent in manœuvring and fighting without\r\ndecisive results. Among the killed on the 9th was that able and\r\ndistinguished soldier, Gen. Sedgwick, commander of the 6th Corps, of\r\nwhich Gen. H. G. Wright succeeded to the command. Early on the morning\r\nof the 12th a general attack was made on the enemy in position. The 2d\r\nCorps (Hancock’s) carried a salient of his line, capturing most of\r\nJohnston’s division of Ewell’s corps and 20 pieces of artillery. But the\r\nresistance was so obstinate that the advantage gained did not prove\r\ndecisive.\r\n\r\nFrom the 13th to the 18th was consumed in manœuvring and awaiting the\r\narrival of recruits from Washington. Deeming it impracticable to make\r\nany further attack upon the enemy at Spottsylvania Courthouse, orders\r\nwere issued on the 18th with a view to a movement to the North Anna, to\r\ncommence on the 19th, but owing to an attack of the Confederates the\r\nmovement was delayed until the night of the 21st. The enemy again having\r\nthe short line, and being in possession of the main roads, was enabled\r\nto reach North Anna in advance of the Federals, and took position behind\r\nit, where the battles were again renewed.\r\n\r\n_Battles of North Anna._--The 5th Corps reached the North Anna on the\r\nafternoon of the 23d, closely followed by the 6th Corps; the 2d and 9th\r\ngot up about the same time. Gen. Warren effected a crossing the same\r\nafternoon and got into position. Soon after getting into position he was\r\nviolently attacked, but repulsed the enemy with great slaughter. Hancock\r\nalso effected a crossing after some fighting. The 6th Corps crossed on\r\nthe 24th and took up a position. The attempt of the Federals on the\r\nConfederate centre was repulsed, and finding the enemy’s position on the\r\nNorth Anna stronger than either of his previous ones, Gen. Grant\r\nwithdrew on the night of the 26th to the north bank, and moved to turn\r\nthe enemy’s position by his right. The battle of Cold Harbor (which see)\r\nwas the next serious engagement. The loss of the Federals, not including\r\nBurnside’s corps, from May 5 to 31 was about 41,400. The Confederate\r\nloss is not known.\r\n\r\n=Williamsburg.= A city, capital of James City Co., Va., 60 miles east of\r\nRichmond, and 68 miles northwest of Norfolk. It is situated on a level\r\nplain between James and York Rivers, 6 miles from each. It was first\r\nsettled in 1632, is the oldest incorporated town in the State, and was\r\nthe colonial and State capital till 1779. A battle was fought here\r\nbetween Gen. McClellan and the Confederates on May 5, 1862, which\r\nresulted in victory to the former.\r\n\r\n=Wilmington.= A city and port of North Carolina, in New Hanover County,\r\nand situated on the Cape Fear River. It was captured by the Union forces\r\nin February, 1865, Fort Fisher, its principal defense, having been taken\r\nby storm on the 15th of the month preceding.\r\n\r\n=Wiltshire=, or =Wiltonshire=. An inland county of England. When Cæsar\r\ninvaded England, Wiltshire was occupied by the Belgæ; and the Wansdyke\r\nis pointed to as a portion of the defenses which they constructed. It\r\nwas afterwards included in the province of Britannia Prima, and\r\nimportant Roman stations were established, of which the chief was\r\nplaced at Sorbiodunum (Old Sarum). The Saxons under Cedric were defeated\r\nby Arthur and his famous knights, but conquered the country when led by\r\nCynric, and annexed it to the kingdom of Wessex. It became the\r\nbattle-field between Saxon and Dane for many long years of warfare. A\r\ngreat council was held at Sarum in 1086, by William the Conqueror, which\r\nfirmly fixed upon the conquered land the feudal system of the Normans.\r\nDuring the civil war, many important engagements took place in various\r\nparts of the county, and especially at Devizes and Malmesbury, between\r\nRoundheads and Cavaliers.\r\n\r\n=Winch.= An axle turned by a crank-handle for raising weights, as from\r\nmines and the like; a windlass.\r\n\r\n=Winchelsea.= A town of England, in Sussex, 37 miles northeast from\r\nBrighton. It is a place of great antiquity, and was twice pillaged,\r\nfirst by the French and again by the Spaniards, who landed near Farley\r\nHead.\r\n\r\n=Winchester= (Rom. _Venta Belgarum_). A town of England, capital of\r\nHampshire. It is a very ancient town, whose erection may reasonably be\r\nascribed to the Celtic Britons. It was taken by the Saxons in 495, and\r\nby the Danes in 871-73; and was ravaged by Sweyn in 1013. Winchester was\r\nseveral times taken and retaken between 1641 and 1643; it was taken by\r\nCromwell, and the castle dismantled in 1645.\r\n\r\n=Winchester.= A city and capital of Frederick Co., Va., in the valley of\r\nthe Shenandoah, 150 miles north-northwest of Richmond, 71 miles west by\r\nnorth from Washington. On March 12, 1862, it was occupied by the Federal\r\ngeneral Banks, and during the war was the scene of frequent conflicts,\r\nand occupied in turn by the Federal and Confederate armies.\r\n\r\n=Winchester Rifle.= See SMALL-ARMS, and MAGAZINE GUNS.\r\n\r\n=Windage.= Is the space left between the bore of a piece and its\r\nprojectile, and is measured by the difference of their diameters. The\r\nobjects of windage are to facilitate loading, and to diminish the danger\r\nof bursting the piece; it is rendered necessary by the mechanical\r\nimpossibility of making every projectile of the proper size and shape,\r\nby the unyielding nature of the material of which large projectiles are\r\nmade, by the foulness which collects in the bore after each discharge,\r\nand by the use of hot and strapped shot. The _true windaqe_, which is\r\nthe difference between the true diameters of the bore and projectile,\r\nincreases slightly with the size of the bore, and is greater for solid\r\nshot, which are sometimes fired hot, than for hollow projectiles, which\r\nare never heated.\r\n\r\n_Loss of Force._--The ordinary windage of smooth-bore cannon, used in\r\nthe U. S. service, is about ¹⁄₄₀ of the diameter of the bore, and the\r\nloss of force arising from the escape of gas through this windage\r\namounts to a very considerable portion of the entire charge. The amount\r\nof loss in any case depends on: (1) The degree of windage; (2) The\r\ncaliber of the gun; (3) The length of the bore; (4) The kind of powder;\r\n(5) The charge of powder; (6) The weight or density of the ball. It is\r\nprobable that the influence which some of these causes exert on the\r\nforce of the charge is very slight. It has been determined by\r\nexperiment, that the loss of velocity by windage is proportional to the\r\nwindage. It may be stated that the loss of velocity by a given windage\r\nis directly as the windage, and inversely as the diameter of the bore,\r\nvery nearly.\r\n\r\n=Wind-gauge.= In a military sense, is an attachment to the sight (either\r\nfront- or rear-sight) of a fire-arm by which an allowance for the effect\r\nof wind on the projectile can be made in aiming. Though usually called\r\n_wind-gauge_, it is also used to counteract _drift_ or any other\r\ndeviation which can be anticipated. In the old model target-rifles, the\r\nfront-sight is capable of a slight movement. Some of the more recent\r\nmilitary arms have a wind-gauge attached to the rear-sight. In the\r\n_peep-sights_, the sight-piece is moved by a screw. In the present U. S.\r\nservice rifle the sight-piece is moved by hand. It has graduations to\r\nguide the marksman. The wind-gauge is frequently attached to\r\nbreech-sights of cannon in Europe. In this country the Parrott gun is\r\nsimilarly equipped.\r\n\r\n=Wind-gun.= A gun discharged by the force of compressed air; an air-gun.\r\n\r\n=Windlace.= Formerly an apparatus for bending the bow of an arblast or\r\ncross-gun.\r\n\r\n=Windlass.= An axis, or roller of wood, square at each end, through\r\nwhich are either cross-holes for handspikes, or staves across, to turn\r\nit round, by which operation it draws a rope, one end of which is\r\nattached to a weight, which is thus raised from any depth.\r\n\r\n=Windsor, Knights of.= See KNIGHTS, MILITARY.\r\n\r\n=Wing.= The right or left division of an army, regiment, and the like.\r\nThe word is sometimes used to denote the large sides of horn-works,\r\ntenailles, and other outworks.\r\n\r\n=Wing.= An ornament worn on the shoulder;--a small imitation epaulette\r\nor shoulder-knot.\r\n\r\n=Winged.= In heraldry, represented with wings, or having wings, of a\r\ndifferent color from the body.\r\n\r\n=Winnebagoes.= A tribe of Indians who lived around Lake Winnebago in\r\n1639, and were engaged in the war of Pontiac against the English in\r\n1762. In 1794 they were severely defeated by Gen. Wayne, and were\r\nengaged in the Black Hawk war of 1831. They were removed to Minnesota in\r\n1848, from thence to Dakota in 1863, and in the following year to\r\nNebraska. See INDIANS AND THEIR AGENCIES.\r\n\r\n=Winter-quarters.= The quarters of an army during the winter; a winter\r\nresidence or station.\r\n\r\n=Wire-cartridge.= A cartridge strengthened by wire ligaments.\r\n\r\n=Wires, Pointing-.= See POINTING-WIRES.\r\n\r\n=Wisby.= A once famous seaport of the Swedish island of Gothland,\r\ncapital of the island, and situated on its west coast, about 130 miles\r\nsouth of Stockholm. In 1361, Valdemar III. of Denmark took this town by\r\nstorm, and, plundering it, obtained an immense booty.\r\n\r\n=Wisconsin.= One of the Northwestern States of the United States of\r\nAmerica; it is 302 miles from north to south, and 258 from east to west.\r\nWisconsin is bounded on the north by Lake Superior and the State of\r\nMichigan, east by Lake Michigan, south by Illinois, and west by Iowa and\r\nMinnesota, from which it is separated by the Mississippi and St. Croix\r\nRivers. This State was explored by French missionaries in the latter\r\npart of the 17th century, and Indian trading-posts were also\r\nestablished. It was organized as a Territory in 1836, and admitted into\r\nthe Union as a State in 1848. During the late civil war it filled its\r\nquotas cheerfully for the Union cause.\r\n\r\n=Wissembourg=, or =Weissenbourg=. A small fortified town of Alsace, in\r\nwhat was formerly the French department of Bas-Rhin, situated on the\r\nLauter. It was formerly an imperial city, was seized by Louis XIV. in\r\n1673, and annexed to France by the treaty of Ryswick, 1697. The “lines”\r\nof Wissembourg, erected by Villars, in 1705, were taken by the Austrians\r\nand retaken by the French, 1793, after Hoche’s victory at Geisberg. On\r\nAugust 4, 1870, the crown-prince of Prussia crossed the Lauter and\r\ngained a brilliant but bloody victory over the French (a part of\r\nMacMahon’s division), storming the lines and the Geisberg. Gen. Abel\r\nDouay was mortally wounded, and about 500 prisoners were made. The\r\nkilled and wounded on both sides appear to have been nearly equal. The\r\nGerman army, composed of Prussians, Bavarians, and Würtembergers, were,\r\nit is said, about 40,000, against about 10,000 French, who fought with\r\ndesperate bravery.\r\n\r\n=Witepsk=, or =Vitepsk=. A city of Russia in Europe, where a battle was\r\nfought between the French under Marshal Victor, duke of Belluno, and the\r\nRussians commanded by Gen. Wittgenstein. The French were defeated after\r\na desperate engagement, with the loss of 3000 men, November 14, 1812.\r\n\r\n=Withstand.= To oppose; to resist; as, to withstand the attack of\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n=Witness.= One who testifies in a cause, or gives evidence before a\r\njudicial tribunal; one who gives testimony. Every judge-advocate of a\r\ncourt-martial or court of inquiry has power to issue the like process,\r\nto compel witnesses to appear and testify, which courts of criminal\r\njurisdiction within the State, Territory, or District where such\r\nmilitary courts are ordered to sit may lawfully issue. For oath\r\nadministered to witnesses, depositions, etc., see APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF\r\nWAR, 91, 92, and 118.\r\n\r\n=Wittenberg.= A fortified town of Prussian Saxony, capital of a circle\r\nof the same name in the government of Merseburg, on the Elbe. It has\r\nsuffered several times from sieges, particularly in 1756 and 1814,\r\nhaving on the latter occasion been taken by storm from the French after\r\na siege of ten months.\r\n\r\n=Wolf-hole.= See TROU DE LOUP.\r\n\r\n=Wolgast.= A seaport of Prussia, in Pomerania, situated on the Peene,\r\nabout 10 miles from its entrance into the Baltic. It is a very old town,\r\nand was strongly fortified as early as the 12th century. It was taken\r\nand retaken five times between 1628 and 1675; the Russians plundered and\r\nburned it in 1713, and the Swedes retook it in 1715.\r\n\r\n=Women and Domestic Relations, Protection of.= See APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF\r\nWAR, 58.\r\n\r\n=Wood.= The most useful timbers in the United States are: the hickory,\r\nwhich is very tough and inflexible; white oak, tough and pliable; white\r\nash, tough and elastic; black walnut, hard and fine-grained; white\r\npoplar, soft, light, fine-grained wood; white pine and other pines, for\r\nbuilding; cypress, soft, light, straight-grained, and grows to a large\r\nsize; dogwood, hard and fine-grained. The timber growing in the centre\r\nof a forest is best.\r\n\r\n=Wooden Fuze.= See LABORATORY STORES.\r\n\r\n=Woolwich.= A town of England, in Kent, and is the most ancient military\r\nand naval arsenal in England. It is celebrated for its royal dock-yard,\r\nwhere men of war have been built so early as the reign of Henry VIII.,\r\n1512. The royal arsenal was formed about 1720; it contains vast\r\nmagazines of great guns, mortars, shells, powder, and other warlike\r\nstores; a foundry with several furnaces for casting ordnance; and a\r\nlaboratory where fireworks, cartridges, grenades, etc., are made for\r\npublic service. There is also a royal artillery barracks here which can\r\naccommodate nearly 4000 men. About 10,000 persons are employed in\r\nWoolwich Arsenal.\r\n\r\n=Woolwich Gun.= See ORDNANCE, CONSTRUCTION OF.\r\n\r\n=Woordie-Major.= The native adjutant of an Indian irregular cavalry\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n=Worcester.= The capital of Worcestershire, England, situated on the\r\nleft bank of the Severn. It is one of the most ancient cities of the\r\nkingdom, and was formerly strongly fortified, as it had to resist\r\nfrequent attacks from the Welsh, and in turbulent periods of English\r\nhistory was often the object of assault by contending parties. In the\r\ncivil war the final great battle between the Puritans and the cavaliers\r\ntook place here. This battle, which Cromwell called his “crowning\r\nmercy,” was fought on September 3, 1651, between the Parliamentary\r\ntroops, commanded by Cromwell in person, and the Scotch army of Charles\r\nII. The battle lasted several hours, and at its close the Scotch were\r\nutterly routed, nearly all of them being killed or made prisoners.\r\n\r\n=Worcestershire.= An inland county of England, forming part of the west\r\nmidland division. Its early history cannot be determined with accuracy.\r\nUnder the Saxons the county was included in the kingdom of Mercia. It\r\nshared in all the great civil wars of England; it was frequently the\r\nscene of contests between the Saxons and the Danes; the great battle\r\nwhich decided the fate of Simon de Montfort was fought in the vale of\r\nEvesham; and during the civil war Worcestershire was disturbed by\r\nfrequent skirmishes. The battle which settled Cromwell in possession of\r\nthe government was fought under the walls of the chief city. See\r\nWORCESTER.\r\n\r\n=Words of Command.= Are certain terms which have been adopted for the\r\nexercise and movement of military bodies, according to the nature of\r\neach particular service. Words of command are classed under two\r\nprincipal heads, and consist of those which are given by the chief or\r\ncommander of a brigade, or division, and of those which are uttered by\r\nthe subordinate officers of troops or companies, etc. _Cautionary\r\nwords_, are certain leading instructions which are given to designate\r\nany particular manœuvre. The cautionary words precede the words of\r\ncommand. See COMMANDS.\r\n\r\n=Working Party.= A body of soldiers told off, by command, to perform\r\ncertain work or labor foreign to their ordinary duties. The men\r\ngenerally receive additional pay while performing this labor.\r\n\r\n=Works.= Are the fortifications about the body of a place. This word is\r\nalso used to signify the approaches of the besiegers, and the several\r\nlines, trenches, etc., made round a place, an army, or the like, for its\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n=Works, Advanced.= See ADVANCED WORKS.\r\n\r\n=Works, Detached.= See DETACHED WORKS.\r\n\r\n=Works, Field-.= See FIELD-WORKS.\r\n\r\n=Worm.= See IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Worm a Gun, To.= To take out the charge of a fire-arm by means of a\r\nworm.\r\n\r\n=Worms.= A city of Western Germany, grand duchy of Hesse, near the left\r\nbank of the Rhine, 26 miles southeast of Mayence. This is one of the\r\noldest, and in the early history of Germany was one of the most\r\nimportant, towns in the country. After its destruction by Attila the Hun\r\nabout the middle of the 5th century, it was rebuilt by Clovis in 496. It\r\nafterwards became the seat of many Frankish and Carlovingian kings.\r\nWorms was also the seat of many imperial diets, the best known of which\r\nis that of 1521, when Luther appeared before the emperor Charles V. In\r\n1689 it was burned by order of Louis XIV.; and was taken by the French\r\nunder Custine, October 4, 1792. Here, in 1743, an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance was entered into by Great Britain and Austria with\r\nSardinia.\r\n\r\n=Worst, To.= To defeat; to overthrow; to put to the rout.\r\n\r\n=Wörth.= A village of Alsace, at the junction of the Sulzbach und the\r\nSauerbach, is noted as the point where the first decisive encounter took\r\nplace between the French and German armies, August 6, 1870. After\r\nstorming Wissenbourg on August 4, 1870, the crown-prince of Prussia with\r\nthe 3d army (about 120,000) marched rapidly forward and surprised part\r\nof the French army under Marshal MacMahon, including the corps of\r\nCanrobert and Failly (about 47,000), and defeated it in a long,\r\ndesperate, and sanguinary engagement near this place. The battle lasted\r\nfrom 7 A.M. till 4 P.M. The chief struggles occurred in the country\r\naround Reichshoffen and in the village of Frœschweiller; the French are\r\nsaid to have charged the German line eleven times, each time breaking\r\nit, but always finding a fresh mass behind. The ridge on which Wörth\r\nstands was not captured until the French were taken in flank by the\r\nBavarians and Würtembergers. Nearly all MacMahon’s staff were killed,\r\nand the marshal himself unhorsed, fell fainting into a ditch, from which\r\nhe was rescued by a soldier. He then, on foot, directed the retreat\r\ntowards Saverne, to cover the passes of the Vosges. The victory is\r\nattributed to the very great numerical superiority of the Germans (about\r\n130,000) as well as to their excellent strategy. The French loss has\r\nbeen estimated at 20,000 killed and wounded, and about 6000 prisoners, 2\r\neagles, 6 mitrailleures, 30 cannon, and much baggage. The Germans are\r\nstated to have had above 8000 men put _hors de combat_. It was admitted\r\nthat MacMahon had acted as an able and brave commander.\r\n\r\n=Wounded, The.= All the individuals belonging to an army who may have\r\nbeen maimed, or otherwise hurt in battle.\r\n\r\n=Wreath=, =Wreathed=. In heraldry, a wreath is a twisted garland of silk\r\nof different colors, otherwise called a torce, on which it has, since\r\nthe 14th century, been usual to place the crest. The side-view of a\r\nwreath exhibits six divisions, which are generally tinctured with the\r\nliving colors,--that is, the principal metal and color of the shield.\r\nEvery crest is now understood to be placed upon a wreath, except when it\r\nis expressly stated to issue out of a _chapeau_ or _coronet_. A wreath,\r\nwhen represented alone, shows its circular form. A Moor’s head is\r\nsometimes encircled with a heraldic wreath. A wreath is always\r\nunderstood to be the twisted garland of silk above explained, unless\r\notherwise specified; but wreaths of laurel, oak, ivy, etc., sometimes\r\noccur, and savages used as supporters are often wreathed about the head\r\nand middle with laurel. Ordinaries are occasionally wreathed, otherwise\r\ncalled _tortille_, in which case they are represented as if composed of\r\ntwo colors, twisted as in the heraldic wreath; as in the coat of\r\nCarmichael, argent, a fess wreathed azure and gules.\r\n\r\n=Wright-fuze.= See LABORATORY STORES.\r\n\r\n=Wrong.= To guard against injustice and oppression in the army, the\r\nArticles of War (see APPENDIX, ARTICLES OF WAR) clearly point out the\r\nmode of redress to every individual in the service, who considers\r\nhimself wronged by his superiors.\r\n\r\n=Wrought Iron.= See ORDNANCE, METALS FOR.\r\n\r\n=Würtemberg=, or =Wirtemberg, Kingdom of=. A state in the southwest of\r\nGermany, which was erected into a kingdom in 1806. It was originally\r\npart of Suabia, and was made a county for Ulric I., about 1265, and a\r\nduchy in 1495. Würtemberg has been repeatedly traversed by hostile\r\narmies, particularly since the revolution of France. Moreau made his\r\ncelebrated retreat October 23, 1796. This kingdom opposed Prussia in the\r\nwar of 1866, but made peace on August 31, following. On November 5,\r\n1870, it joined the other German states in the formation of the German\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n=Wyandot Indians.= See HURON INDIANS.\r\n\r\n=Wyoming.= A Territory of the United States, organized July 25, 1868,\r\nfrom a region attached to Dakota, but formerly included in Idaho, and\r\nstill earlier known as part of Nebraska. Its average length from east to\r\nwest is 355 miles, and its breadth 276 miles. This Territory has been\r\noverrun several times by hostile Indians, but under the strong hand of\r\nthe military the country is becoming rapidly settled.\r\n\r\n=Wyoming Valley.= A beautiful fertile valley on the Susquehanna River,\r\nin Pennsylvania. It is 21 miles long by 3 wide, and surrounded by\r\nmountains 1000 feet high. It was purchased about 1765 by a Connecticut\r\ncompany from the Delaware Indians; but the settlers were soon dispersed\r\nby hostile savages. In 1769, forty families came from Connecticut, but\r\nfound a party of Pennsylvanians in possession, and for several years\r\nthere were continual contests of the settlers with the Indians, and with\r\neach other. In 1776, the settlers armed for their own defense against\r\nthe English and their Indian allies; but in 1778 most of their troops\r\nwere called to join the army under Washington. On June 30, a force of\r\n400 British provincials, or “Tories,” and 700 Seneca Indians, led by\r\nCol. John Butler, entered the valley, and were opposed by 300 men, under\r\nCol. Zebulon Butler. On July 3, the settlers were driven to the shelter\r\nof Fort Forty (so called from the original number of families), with the\r\nloss of two-thirds of their number, many soldiers and inhabitants being\r\nmurdered. On the 5th, the remnant of the troops surrendered, and they\r\nand the inhabitants were either massacred or driven from the valley,\r\nwhich was left a smoking solitude.\r\n\r\n=Wyvern.= A fictitious monster of the Middle Ages, of frequent\r\noccurrence in heraldry. It resembles a dragon, but has only two legs and\r\nfeet, which are like those of the eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Xanthica.= A military festival observed by the Macedonians in the month\r\ncalled Xanthicus (our April), instituted about 392 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Xanthus.= The most famous city of Lycia, stood on the western bank of\r\nthe river of the same name, 60 stadia from its mouth. Twice in the\r\ncourse of its history it sustained sieges, which terminated in the\r\nself-destruction of the inhabitants with their property, first against\r\nthe Persians under Harpagus, and long afterward against the Romans under\r\nBrutus. The city was never restored after its destruction by the latter.\r\n\r\n=Xeres de la Frontera.= A town in the southwest of Spain, in the\r\nprovince of Cadiz, 14 miles northeast from Cadiz. At the battle of\r\nXeres, July 19-26, 711, Roderic, the last Gothic sovereign of Spain, was\r\ndefeated and slain by the Saracens, commanded by Tarik and Muza.\r\n\r\n=Ximena= (Southern Spain). The site of a battle between the Spanish army\r\nunder the command of Gen. Ballasteros, and the French corps commanded by\r\nGen. Regnier, September 10, 1811. The Spaniards defeated their\r\nadversaries; the loss was great on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yager.= One belonging to a body of light infantry armed with rifles.\r\nWritten also _jager_.\r\n\r\n=Yankton Indians.= See DAKOTA INDIANS.\r\n\r\n=Yataghan.= A Turkish poniard having a Damascus blade, straight or\r\ncrooked. It has a double edge, and sharp point, with a ridge in the\r\nmiddle of its whole length; the handle and scabbard are generally highly\r\nornamented and costly.\r\n\r\n=Yeomanry.= A volunteer force of cavalry in Great Britain, numbering\r\nabout 14,000 men, and costing the country annually about £85,000. It was\r\noriginally formed during the wars of the French revolution, and then\r\ncomprised infantry as well as cavalry; but the whole of the infantry\r\ncorps, and many of the cavalry, were disbanded after the peace of 1814.\r\nThe organization of the corps is by counties, under the\r\nlords-lieutenant. The men provide their own horses and uniform, in\r\nconsideration of which they receive annually a clothing and contingent\r\nallowance of £2 a man, are exempt from taxation in respect to the horses\r\nemployed on yeomanry duty, and draw during the annual training 2_s._ a\r\nday for forage, besides a subsistence allowance of 7_s._ a day. If\r\ncalled out for permanent duty they receive cavalry pay, with forage\r\nallowance. The yeomanry are available in aid of the civil power; and in\r\ntime of invasion, or apprehended invasion, the sovereign may embody them\r\nfor service in any part of Great Britain, under the provisions of the\r\nMutiny Act and Articles of War.\r\n\r\n=Yeomen of the Guard.= A veteran company, consisting of 100 old soldiers\r\nof stately presence, employed on grand occasions, in conjunction with\r\nthe gentlemen-at-arms, as the body-guard of the sovereign. These yeomen\r\nwere constituted a corps, in 1485, by King Henry VII., and they still\r\nwear the costume of that period. Armed with partisans, and in the quaint\r\nuniform, the men present a curious sight in the 19th century. The\r\nofficers of the corps are a captain (ordinarily a peer), a lieutenant,\r\nand an ensign. There is also a “Clerk of the Cheque and Adjutant.” All\r\nthese appointments are held by old officers, and are considered as\r\nimportant prizes. The whole charge is borne by the sovereign’s civil\r\nlist. The headquarters of the corps is at the Tower of London, where the\r\nmen are popularly known as “Beef-eaters.”\r\n\r\n=Yermuk= (Syria). Near here the emperor Heraclius was totally defeated\r\nby the Saracens, after a fierce engagement, November, 636. Damascus was\r\ntaken, and his army was expelled from Syria.\r\n\r\n=Yesawul.= In India, a state messenger; a servant of parade, who carries\r\na gold or silver staff; an aide-de-camp.\r\n\r\n=York.= The capital of Yorkshire, England, is situated at the junction\r\nof the rivers Ouse and Foss. Before the invasion of the Romans it formed\r\none of the chief cities of the Brigantes, the most powerful of British\r\ntribes; and it is supposed that on their subjugation by Agricola, he\r\nfounded here about the year 79 the Roman city of Eboracum, which became\r\nthe great “Colonia” of the Romans in Britain, the seat of imperial\r\ngovernment, and the “Altera Roma.” On the departure of the Roman\r\ncohorts, about 409, it became a prey to the wars which prevailed between\r\nthe Picts and the Britons, and between the latter and the Saxons; and\r\nalso to the invasions of the Danes; but under these vicissitudes it\r\nstill maintained its distinction as one of the chief cities of the\r\nkingdom. William the Conqueror was long unable to overcome this\r\nstronghold of the north. One Norman garrison, numbering 3000 men, was\r\nput to the sword in 1069; but William exacted a terrible vengeance in\r\nthe following year, when he laid waste the whole country between York\r\nand Durham. During the insurrections consequent upon the dissolution of\r\nthe monasteries by Henry VIII., York was seized by the insurgents of the\r\n“Pilgrimage of Grace”; and in its immediate neighborhood, Fairfax, in\r\n1644, conquered Prince Rupert on Marston Moor; after which battle York\r\nwas taken (July 16) for the Parliament.\r\n\r\n=York= (Upper Canada, founded in 1794; since 1834 named Toronto). In the\r\nwar between America and Great Britain, the U. S. forces made several\r\nattacks upon the province of Upper Canada, and succeeded in taking York,\r\nthe seat of the government, April 27, 1813; but it was soon afterwards\r\nretaken by the British.\r\n\r\n=York and Lancaster, Wars of.= See ROSES, WARS OF THE.\r\n\r\n=Yorkshire.= The largest county of England, is situated in its northern\r\npart. The history of the county in early times may be mainly read in\r\nthat of its chief city. In the troublous times which preceded the\r\nConquest, many battles were fought against the invading Danes, and\r\ngenerally with success. At Stamford Brig, a few miles from York, Harold,\r\nthe last of the Anglo-Saxon kings, defeated the united Danish and\r\nNorwegian armies, three weeks before he fell before the Normans on the\r\nfatal field of Hastings. Among the more notable events of later history,\r\nmay be named the battle of Wakefield, where the Duke of York was\r\ndefeated by Queen Margaret in 1460; the battle of Towton Field, near\r\nTadcaster, fought on Palm-Sunday in 1461, the most sanguinary conflict\r\nof the bitter war between the rival Roses; and that of Marston Moor,\r\nwhich gave the final blow to the falling fortunes of Charles I. Since\r\nthat time, with slight exceptions, its history has been one of peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n=Yorktown.= Capital of York Co., Va., situated on the right bank of the\r\nYork River, 70 miles from Richmond. This locality was the theatre of one\r\nof the most important events in American history,--the surrender of Lord\r\nCornwallis to Gen. Washington, which occurred on October 19, 1781.\r\nYorktown was besieged during the civil war in April, 1862, but before\r\nthe Federals opened fire on the town, the Confederates evacuated it.\r\n\r\n=Youngsters.= A familiar term to signify the junior officers of a troop\r\nor company.\r\n\r\n=Ypres=, or =Yperen=. A fortified town of Belgium, province of West\r\nFlanders, 30 miles south-southwest from Bruges. Ypres in the 9th\r\ncentury, when only a strong castle, was destroyed by the Normans. It was\r\nrebuilt in 901; and was first walled in 1388. Louis XIV., in 1688, made\r\nit one of the strongest fortresses of the Low Countries. In the great\r\nEuropean wars, it seldom escaped a siege or bombardment.\r\n\r\n=Yucatan.= The most eastern department of Mexico, Central America. It is\r\nin the form of a peninsula, jutting out into the Gulf of Mexico. It was\r\ndiscovered in 1517, and conquered by Spain in 1541, and retained until\r\n1821, when it became a department of Mexico. This department declared\r\nitself independent of Mexico in 1846, but it subsequently annexed itself\r\nto Mexico.\r\n\r\n=Yumas.= A tribe of North American Indians, located on the Colorado\r\nRiver, near the village of Yuma. In 1781 they massacred a number of\r\nwhite settlers, and again in 1853 they rose and committed depredations.\r\nSince the latter date they have generally been peaceable. They numbered\r\nin 1876 about 900.\r\n\r\n=Yvres.= Now Ivry-la-Bataille (which see).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Zabern, Rhein=, or =Rhein-Zabern=. A town on the Erlenbach, in Rhenish\r\nBavaria. It is noted for the two battles fought here and at the village\r\nof Jokgrin, about 2 miles farther south, between the Austrians and the\r\nFrench, June 29 and August 20, 1793.\r\n\r\n=Zagaie.= A long dart or lance in use among some African tribes,\r\nparticularly the Moors, while fighting on horseback. It is armed with a\r\nsharp stone and thrown like a javelin. The savages of New Holland are\r\nstill armed with it.\r\n\r\n=Zaikany.= A village of Austria, in Transylvania, 38 miles from Deva. It\r\nwas here that Trajan won his third victory over Decebalus, a part of\r\nwhose treasure was discovered, as it is supposed, in 1543.\r\n\r\n=Zaim.= High caste among the Turks, who are bound to maintain a\r\nproportion of militia according to their revenue, viz., one horseman for\r\nevery 5000 aspres.\r\n\r\n=Zama Regia.= A strongly-fortified city in the interior of Numidia, on\r\nthe borders of the Carthaginian territory. It was the ordinary residence\r\nof King Juba and was the scene of one of the most important battles in\r\nthe history of the world, that in which Hannibal was defeated by Scipio,\r\nand the second Punic war was ended, 202 B.C.\r\n\r\n=Zamora.= A very ancient town of Spain, of the province of that name, on\r\nthe right bank of the Douro, 132 miles northwest of Madrid. Zamora was\r\nof great importance in the Moorish times, and is said to have been\r\ninclosed by seven lines of walls, with a moat between each. Sir J. Moore\r\nurged the Junta of Salamanca to repair the defenses of Zamora, and\r\nreceive there his stores; but his retreat had commenced before they had\r\ndone deliberating. The French afterwards got possession of it, and\r\nalthough no resistance was made, the town was sacked, neither age nor\r\nsex was spared, and the principal persons were executed. It was again\r\nplundered by the French, and has never recovered these visitations.\r\n\r\n=Zamosc=, or =Zamosz=. A town of Russia in Europe, in the kingdom of\r\nPoland, in the province of Lublin. This place is strongly fortified, and\r\nhas long been considered a military station of importance. In 1656 it\r\nwas unsuccessfully besieged by the Swedes; in 1715 it was surprised by\r\nthe Saxons; and in the civil contests of 1771 the Poles were defeated in\r\nits vicinity by the Russians. In 1812 it was one of the few towns in\r\nwhich the French left a garrison after their retreat from Russia.\r\n\r\n=Zanzibar=, or =Zanguebar=. An island in the Indian Ocean, near the east\r\ncoast of Africa, belonging to the sultan of Zanzibar. In 1784 the island\r\nwas taken by the imaum of Muscat, in whose family the government\r\nremained until 1858.\r\n\r\n=Zaym.= In the East Indies, a feudal chief, or military tenant.\r\n\r\n=Zeithun.= A town and district in the highlands of Cilicia, inhabited by\r\na community of Armenian Christians, virtually independent of the Turkish\r\ngovernment, and forming in fact an Asiatic republic. The Zeithumlus can\r\nmuster an army from 7000 to 8000 men to defend the mountains against the\r\nTurkish pashas; and they are in alliance with a neighboring Turcoman\r\nchief, also independent of the Turks, who brings 10,000 men into the\r\nfield. It was not till after the Crimean war that the massacres in the\r\nEast called special attention to the existence of Zeithun. An attempt by\r\nthe Turks to settle Circassians near Zeithun, gave Aziz Pasha of Marash\r\nan opportunity of attacking the Christians, and the atrocities committed\r\nremind one of the worst excesses of Cawnpore. The inhabitants defended\r\nthemselves, however, with the greatest gallantry, twice defeating in the\r\nfield large Turkish forces; and the struggle was at length terminated by\r\nthe interference of the French and English governments at\r\nConstantinople, and the recall of the pasha.\r\n\r\n=Zela=, or =Ziela=. A city in the south of Pontus, not far south of\r\nAmasia, and four days’ journey east of Tavium. It stood on an artificial\r\nhill, and was strongly fortified. At Zela the Roman general Valerius\r\nTriarius was defeated by Mithridates; but the city is more famous for\r\nanother great battle,--that in which Julius Cæsar defeated Pharnaces,\r\nand of which he wrote this dispatch to Rome: _Veni: Vidi: Vici_.\r\n\r\n=Zenta=, or =Szenta=. A town of Hungary, on the right bank of the\r\nTheiss, 120 miles south-southeast from Pesth. Near here Prince Eugène\r\ndefeated the Turks, September 11, 1697 (1696). This victory led to the\r\npeace of Carlowitz, ratified January, 1699.\r\n\r\n=Zierikzee.= A town of Holland, in the province of Zealand, situated on\r\nthe southeast of the island of Schouwen. It suffered severely in the\r\ncontests between Flanders and Holland for the possession of Zealand. In\r\n1303, the Flemings besieged it with a large army, but were compelled by\r\nCount William of Holland to retire, on August 10, 1304. In the long war\r\nof independence, after an obstinate defense, the Spaniards took\r\nZierikzee in July, 1576.\r\n\r\n=Zigzags.= In fortification, are trenches or paths, with several\r\nwindings, so cut that the besieged are prevented from enfilading the\r\nbesieger in his approaches.\r\n\r\n=Ziyamut.= In the East Indies, a fief bestowed for military services.\r\n\r\n=Zizarme.= A sort of ancient pike or lance.\r\n\r\n=Znaym=, or =Znaim=. A town of Austria, situated on the Thaya, 34 miles\r\nsouthwest from Brunn. A conflict took place here in 1809, between the\r\nAustrians and the French.\r\n\r\n=Zoarque.= A soldier who had charge of an elephant among the ancients.\r\n\r\n=Zone of Defense.= A term used in fortification, signifying the belt of\r\nground in front of the general _contour_ of the works within effective\r\nrange of the defenders.\r\n\r\n=Zone of Operations.= The strip of territory which contains the lines of\r\noperations--or lines on which an army advances--between the base and the\r\nulterior object. See STRATEGY.\r\n\r\n=Zorndorf.= A village of Prussia, province of Brandenburg, 4 miles north\r\nof Kustrin, and was the scene of the bloodiest of the many desperate\r\nconflicts of the Seven Years’ War. The Russians having for the second\r\ntime been ordered by the czarina Elizabeth to invade Prussia, advanced\r\ntowards Berlin, committing frightful devastations, while Frederick the\r\nGreat, with the bulk of his forces, was engaged with the Austrians in\r\nSilesia and Saxony. The Russians, under Fermor, were 50,000 strong, and\r\neasily drove before them Dohna’s little Prussian army of 15,000; but\r\nFrederick hastened northwards with such reinforcements as raised the\r\narmy to 30,000; and after taking care, by the breaking down of bridges,\r\netc., to cut off their retreat, engaged the invaders. The battle was\r\ncommenced at eight on the morning of August 25, 1758, and lasted till\r\nevening, consisted mainly in a succession of furious charges,\r\naccompanied with a tremendous artillery-fire, and was not decided till\r\nSeidlitz, by an able movement, turned the Russian flank. The next\r\nmorning Fermor drew off his forces, diminished by 20,000 men, 103\r\ncannon, and 27 standards; having inflicted on the Prussians a loss of\r\n13,000 men, 26 cannon, and a few standards.\r\n\r\n=Zouaves= (Arab. _Zwawa_). A body of troops in the French army, which\r\nderives its name from a tribe of Kabyles, inhabiting the mountains of\r\nJurjura, in the Algerian province of Constantine. Long previous to the\r\ninvasion of Algiers by the French, these Kabyles had been employed as\r\nhired mercenaries in the service of the rulers of Tripoli, Tunis, and\r\nAlgiers; and after the conquest of the last-named country in 1830, the\r\nFrench, in the hope of establishing a friendly feeling between the\r\nnatives and their conquerors, took the late dey’s mercenaries into their\r\nservice, giving them a new organization. Accordingly, Gen. Clausel\r\ncreated, in 1830, two battalions of zouaves, in which each company\r\nconsisted of French and Kabyles in certain proportions, officers,\r\nsubalterns, and soldiers being selected from either race; the zouaves,\r\nthough retaining their Moorish dress, were armed and disciplined after\r\nthe European fashion; and the battalions were recruited by voluntary\r\nenlistment. Afterwards the native element was eliminated, and since 1840\r\nthey may be considered as French troops in a Moorish dress. They now\r\nnumber about 15,000, and are divided into four regiments. They are\r\nrecruited from the veterans of the ordinary infantry regiments who are\r\ndistinguished for their fine “physique” and tried courage and\r\nhardihood. Their uniform is very picturesque. There is one regiment of\r\nzouaves incorporated in the Guards. The name was also given to several\r\nregiments of volunteers in the Union army during the American civil war\r\n(1861-65), who were clad in zouave uniform.\r\n\r\n=Zullichau= (Prussia). Here the Russians under Soltikow severely\r\ndefeated the Prussians under Wedel, July 23, 1759.\r\n\r\n=Zululand.= The country lying northeast of the colony of Natal, between\r\nits east boundary, the Umtugela and Umzimyati Rivers, lat. 29° 10′ E.,\r\nand Delagoa Bay, lat. 26° S., long. 32° 40′ E., is generally known under\r\nthe name of Zululand, or the Zulu country, inhabited by independent\r\ntribes of Zulu Kaffirs. The Zulu is by nature social, light of heart,\r\nand cheerful; his passions are, however, strong, and called out when in\r\na state of war. He is hospitable and honest, yet greedy and stingy; and\r\nwhatever the better nature of his impulses may be, yet when his great\r\nchief commands war, he is converted into a demon. It is from the Zulu\r\ncountry, however, that those terrible tyrants who so long devastated\r\nSoutheastern Africa, the chiefs Chaka, Dingaan, Moselikatze, etc.,\r\nissued. The training of their subjects to a peculiar mode of warfare\r\nspread desolation and havoc for many years among the Betjuana and other\r\ntribes of the interior. These chiefs with their thousands of followers,\r\nfighting, like Homer’s heroes, hand to hand, armed with stabbing\r\nassagais and shields of ox-hide, the colors of which distinguished the\r\ndifferent regiments they were formed into, melted away with broken power\r\ninto comparative insignificance before the terrible rifles of a few\r\nhundred emigrant Dutch Boers, who, in their turn, gave way to the\r\nenergetic action of the British authorities. The Zulus often have\r\nserious intestine wars among themselves. The principal Zulu tribes are\r\nthe Amazulu, the Amahute, Amazwazi, and Amatabele. The last, under the\r\nchief Moselikatze, have emigrated far to the north, where, among the\r\nmountains which separate the valley of the Limpopo from the basin of the\r\nZambesi, they still issue forth, and carry their depredations as far\r\nnorth as the Lake Nyassa, where they were found by Dr. Livingstone. A\r\nwar broke out in the latter part of 1878, or beginning of 1879, between\r\nthe British and the Zulus, and on January 22, 1879, the British were\r\ndefeated with terrible slaughter about 10 miles in front of Rorke’s\r\ndrift; their loss in killed being put down at 30 officers, about 500\r\nenlisted men of the Imperial troops, and 700 enlisted men of the\r\nColonial troops. It seems that the troops were enticed away from their\r\ncamp, as the action took place about one mile and a quarter from it. The\r\ncamp containing surplus ammunition, etc., of the British force was taken\r\nby the Zulus, but was occupied after dark the same night by British\r\ntroops. About the same time Rorke’s drift was attacked by some 3000 or\r\n4000 Zulus; its defense by some 80 men of the 24th Regiment was most\r\ngallant, 370 bodies lay close around the post; the loss of the Zulus was\r\nestimated at 1000 here alone. At the camp where the disaster occurred,\r\nthe loss of the Zulus was computed at over 2000. The Zulus are even more\r\nformidable than the military authorities expected; they are well\r\ndrilled, great numbers are armed with breech-loaders, and they fight\r\ncourageously. It is now known but too well how large a force they can\r\nmass at one point. Lord Chelmsford, the commander of the English forces\r\nin Zululand, after suffering some additional reverses, was superseded in\r\nJune, 1879, by Sir Garnet Wolesley. Eugene Louis Jean Napoleon, prince\r\nimperial of France, participated as a volunteer with the British forces\r\nagainst the Zulus, and was killed (about the end of May or the beginning\r\nof June) while on a reconnoissance under the command of Col. Wood; he\r\nwas suddenly beset by Zulus and assagaied, receiving no less than\r\nseventeen wounds. Prince Napoleon was born in Paris on March 16, 1856.\r\nHe received his “Baptism of Fire” at the battle of Saarbruck, August 2,\r\n1870, during the Franco-German war, in company with his father, the\r\nemperor. After the fall of the empire and the death of his father he\r\nresided in England, and graduated with high honors at the Military\r\nAcademy at Woolwich. The war was terminated in the latter part of 1879,\r\nby the total defeat of the Zulus and the capture of the king Cetawayo.\r\n\r\n=Zumbooruks= (Pers. _Zumboor_, “wasp”). Diminutive swivel artillery,\r\ncarried on the backs of camels.\r\n\r\n=Zurich.= A town of Switzerland, capital of the canton of the same name,\r\nat the northern extremity of the Lake of Zürich, 60 miles northeast from\r\nBerne.

He was probably a\r\nNorman. In the reign of Edward I. a Henry de Percy acquired Alnwick and\r\nother estates in Northumberland. Another Henry de Percy, in the reign of\r\nEdward III., married Mary Plantagenet, a great-granddaughter of King\r\nHenry III., and had two sons, Henry, earl of Northumberland, and Thomas,\r\nearl of Worcester. Henry Percy, surnamed Hotspur, a son of Henry last\r\nnamed, rebelled against Henry IV., and was killed at the battle of\r\nShrewsbury (1408). A son of Hotspur was restored to the earldom, fought\r\nfor the house of Lancaster, and fell at Saint Albans, in 1455, leaving\r\nseveral sons, who were killed in the war of the Roses. In the reign of\r\nElizabeth, a Percy, earl of Northumberland, was executed for rebellion\r\n(1572).\r\n\r\n=Pharaoh.= The term applied in the Bible to the kings of Egypt, of which\r\nmany explanations have been proposed, as _pa-ra_, “the sun;” _pi-ouro_,\r\n“the king;” _per-aa_, “the great house,” “court;” _pa-ra-anh_, or “the\r\nliving sun.” None of these etymologies are altogether satisfactory, some\r\nnot being found at an early period. It is still less possible to connect\r\nit with the name of any Egyptian monarch, and it must have been a common\r\nappellation like _khan_, _cæsar_, or _czar_. Pharaoh is the one under\r\nwhom the Israelites were in bondage, and who compelled them to build the\r\ntreasure-cities of Pithom and Rameses of bricks; and it was under him or\r\nhis successor that Egypt was afflicted with the ten plagues, and that\r\nMoses and Aaron led the Israelites out of Egypt, and the Egyptian army\r\nin its pursuit of the retreating Israelites was drowned in the sea,\r\nalthough it is doubtful if Pharaoh perished with them. The identical\r\nEgyptian monarch who was the Pharaoh of the Exodus has been a subject of\r\ndispute, but it is principally confined to the period of the eighteenth\r\nand nineteenth dynasties. The other Pharaohs mentioned in the Bible are\r\nthe father of Hadad the Edomite, supposed to be a king of the\r\ntwenty-second dynasty; the father-in-law of Solomon; one of the\r\npredecessors of Sheshanka or Shishak; that monarch himself, who overran\r\nthe Holy Land and pillaged Jerusalem; Tirhakah the Ethiopian, who for a\r\ntime wrested Egypt from the Assyrians; Nekau or Necho II., who invaded\r\nPalestine to reduce it to subjection, then in alliance with the\r\nAssyrians, but was finally defeated at Carchemish by Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nthen at a youthful age, 605 B.C.; and Uah-pa-ra, Hophra or Apries, of\r\nthe twenty-sixth dynasty, who marched to relieve the siege of Jerusalem,\r\ncausing the Babylonians to retire for a while, although it was finally\r\ntaken by Nebuchadnezzar, 588 B.C. It is remarkable that the Ethiopian\r\nKings Zerah and so mentioned in the Bible are not styled Pharaohs, like\r\nthe Egyptian rulers, as if for some reason they had not the same title\r\nor were recognized as lawful rulers of the country.\r\n\r\n=Phylarque= (_Fr._). A Grecian cavalry officer who commanded the cavalry\r\nof his tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nR.\r\n\r\n=Reichenbach= (Prussia).

If a copy of\r\nthe charges be not served, or the arrested officer be not brought to\r\ntrial, as herein required, the arrest shall cease. But officers\r\nreleased from arrest, under the provisions of this article, may be\r\ntried, whenever the exigencies of the service shall permit, within\r\ntwelve months after such release from arrest.\r\n\r\nART. 72. Any general officer, commanding the army of the United States,\r\na separate army, or a separate department, shall be competent to appoint\r\na general court-martial, either in time of peace or in time of war.

In time of war the commander of a division, or of a separate\r\nbrigade of troops, shall be competent to appoint a general\r\ncourt-martial.

When the requisite number of officers to form a general\r\ncourt-martial is not present in any post or detachment, the commanding\r\nofficer shall, in cases which require the cognizance of such a court,\r\nreport to the commanding officer of the department, who shall,\r\nthereupon, order a court to be assembled at the nearest post or\r\ndepartment at which there may be such a requisite number of officers,\r\nand shall order the party accused, with necessary witnesses, to be\r\ntransported to the place where the said court shall be assembled.\r\n\r\nART. 77.

The judge-advocate shall administer to each member of the\r\ncourt, before they proceed upon any trial, the following oath, which\r\nshall also be taken by all members of regimental and garrison\r\ncourts-martial: “You, A B, do swear that you will well and truly try and\r\ndetermine, according to evidence, the matter now before you, between the\r\nUnited States of America and the prisoner to be tried, and that you will\r\nduly administer justice, without partiality, favor, or affection,\r\naccording to the provisions of the rules and articles for the government\r\nof the armies of the United States, and if any doubt should arise, not\r\nexplained by said articles, then according to your conscience, the best\r\nof your understanding, and the custom of war in like cases; and you do\r\nfurther swear that you will not divulge the sentence of the court until\r\nit shall be published by the proper authorities; neither will you\r\ndisclose or discover the vote or opinion of any particular member of the\r\ncourt-martial, unless required to give evidence thereof, as a witness,\r\nby a court of justice, in a due course of law. So help you God.”\r\n\r\nART. 85. When the oath has been administered to the members of a\r\ncourt-martial, the president of the court shall administer to the\r\njudge-advocate, or person officiating as such, an oath in the following\r\nform: “You, A B, do swear that you will not disclose or discover the\r\nvote or opinion of any particular member of the court-martial, unless\r\nrequired to give evidence thereof, as a witness, by a court of justice,\r\nin due course of law; nor divulge the sentence of the court to any but\r\nthe proper authority, until it shall be duly disclosed by the same. So\r\nhelp you God.”\r\n\r\nART. 86. A court-martial may punish, at discretion, any person who uses\r\nany menacing words, signs or gestures, in its presence, or who disturbs\r\nits proceedings by any riot or disorder.\r\n\r\nART. 87. All members of a court-martial are to behave with decency and\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\nART. 88. Members of a court-martial may be challenged by a prisoner, but\r\nonly for cause stated to the court. The court shall determine the\r\nrelevancy and validity thereof, and shall not receive a challenge to\r\nmore than one member at a time.\r\n\r\nART. 89. When a prisoner, arraigned before a general court-martial, from\r\nobstinacy and deliberate design, stands mute, or answers foreign to the\r\npurpose, the court may proceed to trial and judgment, as if the prisoner\r\nhad pleaded not guilty.\r\n\r\nART. 90. The judge-advocate, or some person deputed by him, or by the\r\ngeneral or officer commanding the army, detachment, or garrison, shall\r\nprosecute in the name of the United States, but when the prisoner has\r\nmade his plea, he shall so far consider himself counsel for the prisoner\r\nas to object to any leading question to any of the witnesses, and to any\r\nquestion to the prisoner the answer to which might tend to criminate\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nART. 91. The depositions of witnesses residing beyond the limits of the\r\nState, Territory, or District in which any military court may be ordered\r\nto sit, if taken on reasonable notice to the opposite party and duly\r\nauthenticated, may be read in evidence before such court in cases not\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nART. 92. All persons who give evidence before a court-martial shall be\r\nexamined on oath, or affirmation, in the following form: “You swear (or\r\naffirm) that the evidence you shall give, in the case now in hearing,\r\nshall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help\r\nyou God.”\r\n\r\nART. 93. A court-martial shall, for reasonable cause, grant a\r\ncontinuance to either party, for such time, and as often, as may appear\r\nto be just: _Provided_, That if the prisoner be in close confinement,\r\nthe trial shall not be delayed for a period longer than sixty days.\r\n\r\nART. 94. Proceedings of trials shall be carried on only between the\r\nhours of eight in the morning and three in the afternoon, excepting in\r\ncases which, in the opinion of the officer appointing the court, require\r\nimmediate example.\r\n\r\nART. 95. Members of a court-martial, in giving their votes, shall begin\r\nwith the youngest in commission.\r\n\r\nART. 96. No person shall be sentenced to suffer death, except by the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds of the members of a general court-martial, and\r\nin the cases herein expressly mentioned.\r\n\r\nART. 97. No person in the military service shall, under the sentence of\r\na court-martial, be punished by confinement in a penitentiary, unless\r\nthe offense of which he may be convicted would, by some statute of the\r\nUnited States, or by some statute of the State, Territory, or District\r\nin which such offense may be committed, or by the common law, as the\r\nsame exists in such State, Territory, or District, subject such convict\r\nto such punishment.\r\n\r\nART. 98.

When an officer is dismissed from the service for cowardice or\r\nfraud, the sentence shall further direct that the crime, punishment,\r\nname, and place of abode of the delinquent shall be published in the\r\nnewspapers in and about the camp, and in the State from which the\r\noffender came, or where he usually resides; and after such publication\r\nit shall be scandalous for an officer to associate with him.\r\n\r\nART. 101. When a court-martial suspends an officer from command, it may\r\nalso suspend his pay and emoluments for the same time, according to the\r\nnature of his offense.\r\n\r\nART. 102. No person shall be tried a second time for the same offense.\r\n\r\nART. 103. No person shall be liable to be tried and punished by a\r\ngeneral court-martial for any offense which appears to have been\r\ncommitted more than two years before the issuing of the order for such\r\ntrial, unless, by reason of having absented himself, or of some other\r\nmanifest impediment, he shall not have been amenable to justice within\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\nART. 104. No sentence of a court-martial shall be carried into execution\r\nuntil the whole proceedings shall have been approved by the officer\r\nordering the court, or by the officer commanding for the time being.\r\n\r\nART. 105. No sentence of a court-martial, inflicting the punishment of\r\ndeath, shall be carried into execution until it shall have been\r\nconfirmed by the President; except in the cases of persons convicted, in\r\ntime of war, as spies, mutineers, deserters, or murderers, and in the\r\ncases of guerilla marauders, convicted, in time of war, of robbery,\r\nburglary, arson, rape, assault with intent to commit rape, or of\r\nviolation of the laws and customs of war; and in such excepted cases the\r\nsentence of death may be carried into execution upon confirmation by the\r\ncommanding general in the field, or the commander of the department, as\r\nthe case may be.\r\n\r\nART. 106. In time of peace no sentence of a court-martial, directing the\r\ndismissal of an officer, shall be carried into execution, until it shall\r\nhave been confirmed by the President.\r\n\r\nART. 107. No sentence of a court-martial appointed by the commander of\r\na division or of a separate brigade of troops, directing the dismissal\r\nof an officer, shall be carried into execution until it shall have been\r\nconfirmed by the general commanding the army in the field to which the\r\ndivision or brigade belongs.\r\n\r\nART. 108. No sentence of a court-martial, either in time of peace or in\r\ntime of war, respecting a general officer, shall be carried into\r\nexecution, until it shall have been confirmed by the President.\r\n\r\nART. 109. All sentences of a court-martial may be confirmed and carried\r\ninto execution by the officer ordering the court, or by the officer\r\ncommanding for the time being, where confirmation by the President, or\r\nby the commanding general in the field, or commander of the department,\r\nis not required by these articles.\r\n\r\nART. 110. No sentence of a field-officer, detailed to try soldiers of\r\nhis regiment, shall be carried into execution, until the whole\r\nproceedings shall have been approved by the brigade commander, or, in\r\ncase there be no brigade commander, by the commanding officer of the\r\npost.\r\n\r\nART. 111. Any officer who has authority to carry into execution the\r\nsentence of death, or of dismissal of an officer, may suspend the same\r\nuntil the pleasure of the President shall be known; and, in such case,\r\nhe shall immediately transmit to the President a copy of the order of\r\nsuspension, together with a copy of the proceedings of the court.\r\n\r\nART. 112. Every officer who is authorized to order a general\r\ncourt-martial shall have power to pardon or mitigate any punishment\r\nadjudged by it, except the punishment of death, or of dismissal of an\r\nofficer. Every officer commanding a regiment or garrison in which a\r\nregimental or garrison court-martial may be held, shall have power to\r\npardon or mitigate any punishment which such court may adjudge.\r\n\r\nART. 113. Every judge-advocate, or person acting as such, at any general\r\ncourt-martial, shall, with as much expedition as the opportunity of time\r\nand distance of place may admit, forward the original proceedings and\r\nsentence of such court to the Judge-Advocate General of the Army, in\r\nwhose office they shall be carefully preserved.\r\n\r\nART. 114. Every party tried by a general court-martial shall, upon\r\ndemand thereof, made by himself, or by any person in his behalf, be\r\nentitled to a copy of the proceedings and sentence of such court.\r\n\r\nART. 115. A court of inquiry, to examine into the nature of any\r\ntransaction of, or accusation or imputation against, any officer or\r\nsoldier, may be ordered by the President or by any commanding officer;\r\nbut, as courts of inquiry may be perverted to dishonorable purposes, and\r\nmay be employed, in the hands of weak and envious commandants, as\r\nengines for the destruction of military merit, they shall never be\r\nordered by any commanding officer, except upon a demand by the officer\r\nor soldier whose conduct is to be inquired of.\r\n\r\nART. 116.

So help you God.”\r\n\r\nART. 118. A court of inquiry, and the recorder thereof, shall have the\r\nsame power to summon and examine witnesses as is given to courts-martial\r\nand the judge-advocates thereof.

Officers of the militia of the several States, when called\r\ninto the service of the United States, shall on all detachments,\r\ncourts-martial, and other duty wherein they may be employed in\r\nconjunction with the regular or volunteer forces of the United States,\r\ntake rank next after all officers of the like grade in said regular or\r\nvolunteer forces, notwithstanding the commissions of such militia\r\nofficers may be older than the commissions of the said officers of the\r\nregular or volunteer forces of the United States.\r\n\r\nART. 125. In case of the death of any officer, the major of his\r\nregiment, or the officer doing the major’s duty, or the second officer\r\nin command at any post or garrison, as the case may be, shall\r\nimmediately secure all his effects then in camp or quarters, and shall\r\nmake, and transmit to the office of the Department of War, an inventory\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nART. 126.

Witness the following, in the sudden\r\npenetration of the air into a collapsed lung. A gentleman in\r\nPleasantville, Iowa, writing under date of October 10, 1880, says:\r\n\r\n“My daughter had not been confined to her bed, but for the past twelve\r\nyears had not been able to inhale much air in her left lung, in\r\nconsequence of congestion, owing to overheating. She was unable to stand\r\nheat, and she was liable to sinking and smothering spells; also her\r\nheart would not beat regularly; every hour or two it would stop its\r\npulsations, or feel as if it was going to. On the second inhalation her\r\n_lung expanded to its fullest capacity_, which, of course, caused great\r\ndistress of body (as the chest had sunk in over her lung), but ever\r\nsince she has had no symptoms of smothering. _The heart pulsations are\r\nregular, and she feels like a new person; is gaining rapidly in flesh._\r\nHer lung is not yet strong, but is gaining. _We are truly grateful to\r\nyou for rescuing her from an untimely grave._”\r\n\r\n“AM SO MUCH BETTER.”\r\n\r\nExtract from letter of a patient in Biddeford, Me.:\r\n\r\n“It is with pleasure I tell you what your Compound Oxygen Treatment has\r\ndone for me. Last April, when I commenced using it, _I was very low_;\r\nsuffered from a weak, tired feeling all the time. _Had not been able to\r\ndo any housework or sewing for four years, and but very little for ten\r\nyears past._ My right side was very bad, a continual smarting ache\r\nextending from the throat to the hip, aggravated by using my arm. _Had\r\nnot been free from a cough for four years. Now I do most of my\r\nhousework; all my family sewing; walk out every pleasant day; think I\r\ncould walk a mile and not be very tired; am so much happier to feel that\r\nI am some use in the world._ For all this consider myself indebted to\r\nyour Compound Oxygen Treatment.”\r\n\r\nFORCED CHEERFULNESS.\r\n\r\nA patient writes:\r\n\r\n“I used to seem cheerful, and people often remarked it; but my husband\r\nwould look sad, and tell me he feared I did not feel it; which was true.\r\n(I did it to keep up his spirits.) But now it does me good to take a\r\nhearty laugh. Every one I meet says, ‘How well you are looking.’ I tell\r\nthem it is the Compound Oxygen rebuilding me.... _I can scarcely believe\r\nmyself to be the same miserable little woman I once was._”\r\n\r\n“VICTORY!”\r\n\r\nUnder this caption, a gentleman in Iowa, who had procured the Compound\r\nOxygen Treatment for his wife, writes:\r\n\r\n“_I am surprised at finding her so much improved in health._ When she\r\nbegan using the Oxygen she could not sit up more than four hours at a\r\ntime. Could not walk a quarter of a mile. Improved from the first\r\ninhalation, and now, having used the Treatment for six weeks, does\r\nconsiderable work around the house, and _can walk two miles and not be\r\ntired_. Raises no more bloody matter. No cough. Sleeps and eats well.\r\nAll that I can say is, ‘Thank God, and Drs. Starkey & Palen.’”\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\nA lady in Carmel, N. Y., after using the Oxygen Treatment for about four\r\nweeks, writes as follows in regard to the result:\r\n\r\n“Four years ago I had an attack of _Acute Bronchitis_. It was two or\r\nthree months before I got over it, _and then I had lost my voice_. I\r\ncould not sing. The next winter I had two attacks, and in the spring I\r\nhad chronic inflammation of the throat. I was treated for it from March\r\ntill June. Then my husband took me to Brooklyn for medical treatment. I\r\ngot very much better; but as soon as the weather became cold I took\r\ncold, and had to stay in the house for most of the time with an inflamed\r\nthroat. When I sent for the Oxygen I had just had the worst attack from\r\nwhich I had ever suffered. I feared that I was going to lose my voice\r\nentirely, it hurt me so to talk. Last year, every time I had a cold it\r\nleft me with a _pain in the lower part of my left lung_. This summer the\r\ndoctor sounded my lung, and said all the trouble was in the larger air\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n“The first time I inhaled the Oxygen _that pain left me in half an hour,\r\nand I have not felt it since_. For two days my lung felt real good; then\r\nthe inhaling made it feel sore, and every time I coughed it seemed to\r\ncome from that place where the pain had been, and what I passed had a\r\nvery bad taste, but did not look bad.\r\n\r\n“I have taken a great many different things, but never in my life took\r\nanything like the Oxygen. _I feel so strong and well, and have such a\r\ngood, healthy appetite._”\r\n\r\nASTONISHED AT THE RESULT.\r\n\r\nA lady writing from Louisiana, November 15, 1880, says:\r\n\r\n“The reception of your interesting quarterly reminds me that I have been\r\nvery ungrateful to you, in not reporting progress for so long. I am not\r\nyet entirely cured, but when I think of the miserable condition I was in\r\nwhen, on the 7th of last February, I began the Oxygen Home Treatment, _I\r\nam truly astonished at the result_. I am still thin in flesh, but I\r\nbelieve I am still gaining ground. My health is better than in years\r\nbefore, and I can eat anything I can get to eat. I have a small supply\r\nof gas yet, which I use when I feel depressed. I will order another\r\nTreatment before long, for I feel sure it will eventually effect a cure.\r\n_I cannot say how thankful I am for having been induced to send to you\r\nfor the Oxygen._”\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM AN OLD PATIENT.\r\n\r\nWe make an extract from a letter recently received from one of our\r\npatients, which shows the permanent effects of the Oxygen Treatment:\r\n\r\n“You will, no doubt, remember me as one of your patients of more than a\r\nyear ago. I am not entirely cured, nor ever expect to be, as my business\r\nis such that as long as I am able to be about I must go. I am manager of\r\na large grain and stock farm, and my business keeps me out of doors most\r\nof the time, which is a decided benefit to me. _I have felt stronger\r\nthis year than ever before, and have done ten times as much work as ever\r\nbefore._ I still have a part of the last Treatment, which I use once in\r\nawhile when I am not feeling good, _and it immediately revives me_. Only\r\nthis morning I had a bad headache, and felt badly; _I took an inhalation\r\nof the Oxygen and felt like another man_.”\r\n\r\nOur Treatise on Compound Oxygen _is sent free of charge_. It contains a\r\nhistory of the discovery, nature, and action of this new remedy, and a\r\nrecord of many of the remarkable results which have so far attended its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n_Also sent free_, “_Health and Life_,” a quarterly record of cases and\r\ncures under the Compound Oxygen Treatment.\r\n\r\nDEPOSITORY ON PACIFIC COAST.--H.

Factual errors (including dates and names),\r\n  contradictions, duplications, repetitions, ambiguities and debatable\r\n  calculations, formulas, definitions and descriptions have not been\r\n  individually noted or corrected, but have been copied verbatim. Except\r\n  in the Index of Illustrations, the occasional mistakes in the\r\n  alphabetical order of the articles have not been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Plates and illustrations: the spelling and/or language of the captions\r\n  may differ significantly from those in the body of the text and the\r\n  Index to Illustrations. Some captions were largely illegible, and have\r\n  been reconstructed based on the Index of Illustrations or on the main\r\n  text where possible. Several of the individual illustrations lack a\r\n  caption; only when it is clear what the caption should be (i.e., a\r\n  clear, unambiguous illustration that is listed in the Index of\r\n  Illustrations) has a caption been inserted, as listed below. Some\r\n  illustrations have been rotated or otherwise re-arranged for better\r\n  readability or visibility.\r\n\r\n  Changes made\r\n\r\n  Several obvious typographical and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected silently.\r\n\r\n  Footnotes have been moved to directly under the paragraph to which\r\n  they belong.\r\n\r\n  Some tables and mathematical formulas have been re-arranged or\r\n  re-aligned for better readability or moved to separate lines. In some\r\n  cases the italics mark-up (_) has been applied to groups of letters\r\n  and symbols rather than to individual letters or symbols to improve\r\n  readability.\r\n\r\n  page 374: (.3-inch changed to (3 inch)\r\n\r\n  page 375: 935,649,235 pounds changed to 935, 649, and 235 pounds;\r\n  caliber 10,236 inches changed to caliber 10.236 inches",
