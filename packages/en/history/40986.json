But even the latter\r\ndo not insist on its being the work of a modern fabricator. They\r\nallow it to be one hundred, or perhaps one hundred and fifty, years\r\nold. If they admit that, I do not see why they refuse it a greater\r\nantiquity; and as to the improbability of the stories related in it,\r\nI refer the reader to the exhaustive inquiry in Dr Ottema's Preface.\r\n\r\nIs it more difficult to believe that the early Frisians, being hardy\r\nand intrepid marine adventurers, sailed to the Mediterranean, and\r\neven proceeded farther, than that the Phoenicians sailed to England\r\nfor tin, and to the Baltic for amber? or that a clever woman became a\r\nlawgiver at Athens, than that a goddess sprang, full grown and armed,\r\nfrom the cleft skull of Jupiter?\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the narratives of this book inconsistent with\r\nprobability, however they may vary from some of our preconceived\r\nideas; but whether it is really what it pretends to be--a very ancient\r\nmanuscript, or a more modern fiction--it is not the less a most curious\r\nand interesting work, and as such I offer it to the British public.\r\n\r\nIn order to give an idea of the manuscript, I have procured photographs\r\nof two of its pages, which are bound with this volume.\r\n\r\nI have also followed Dr Ottema's plan of printing the original Frisian\r\nopposite to the translation, so that any reader possessing a knowledge\r\nof the language may verify the correctness of the translation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Preface which I have translated, Dr Ottema\r\nhas written two pamphlets on the subject of the Oera Linda Book\r\n(1. Historical Notes and Explanations; 2. The Royal Academy and Het\r\nOera Linda Bok), both of which would be very valuable to any one who\r\nwished to study the controversy respecting the authenticity of the\r\nwork, but which I have not thought it necessary to translate for the\r\npresent publication.\r\n\r\nThere has also appeared in the \"Deventer Courant\" a series of twelve\r\nletters on the same subject. Though written anonymously, I believe\r\nthey are from the pen of Professor Vitringa. They have been translated\r\ninto German by Mr Otto.\r\n\r\nThe writer evidently entered upon his task of criticism with a feeling\r\nof disbelief in the authenticity of the book; but in his last letter\r\nhe admits that, after a minute examination, he is unable to pronounce\r\na positive conviction either for or against it.\r\n\r\nHis concluding remarks are to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n\"If the book is a romance, then I must admit that it has been written\r\nwith a good object, and by a clever man, because the sentiments\r\nexpressed in it are of a highly moral tendency; and the facts\r\nrelated, so far as they can be controlled by regular history, are\r\nnot untruthful; and where they deal with events of which we have no\r\nhistorical records, they do not offend our ideas of possibility or\r\neven probability.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wm. R. Sandbach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. over de Linden, Chief Superintendent of the Royal Dockyard at\r\nthe Helder, possesses a very ancient manuscript, which has been\r\ninherited and preserved in his family from time immemorial, without\r\nany one knowing whence it came or what it contained, owing to both\r\nthe language and the writing being unknown.\r\n\r\nAll that was known was that a tradition contained in it had from\r\ngeneration to generation been recommended to careful preservation. It\r\nappeared that the tradition rests upon the contents of two letters,\r\nwith which the manuscript begins, from Hiddo oera Linda, anno 1256,\r\nand from Liko oera Linda, anno 803. It came to C. over de Linden by\r\nthe directions of his grandfather, Den Heer Andries over de Linden,\r\nwho lived at Enkhuizen, and died there on the 15th of April 1820,\r\naged sixty-one. As the grandson was at that time barely ten years old,\r\nthe manuscript was taken care of for him by his aunt, Aafje Meylhoff,\r\nborn Over de Linden, living at Enkhuizen, who in August 1848 delivered\r\nit to the present possessor.\r\n\r\nDr E. Verwijs having heard of this, requested permission to examine the\r\nmanuscript, and immediately recognised it as very ancient Fries. He\r\nobtained at the same time permission to make a copy of it for the\r\nbenefit of the Friesland Society, and was of opinion that it might\r\nbe of great importance, provided it was not supposititious, and\r\ninvented for some deceptive object, which he feared. The manuscript\r\nbeing placed in my hands, I also felt very doubtful, though I could\r\nnot understand what object any one could have in inventing a false\r\ncomposition only to keep it a secret. This doubt remained until\r\nI had examined carefully-executed facsimiles of two fragments, and\r\nafterwards of the whole manuscript--the first sight of which convinced\r\nme of the great age of the document.\r\n\r\nImmediately occurred to me Cæsar's remark upon the writing of the\r\nGauls and the Helvetians in his \"Bello Gallico\" (i. 29, and vi. 14),\r\n\"Græcis utuntur literis,\" though it appears in v. 48 that they were not\r\nentirely Greek letters. Cæsar thus points out only a resemblance--and\r\na very true one--as the writing, which does not altogether correspond\r\nwith any known form of letters, resembles the most, on a cursory\r\nview, the Greek writing, such as is found on monuments and the oldest\r\nmanuscripts, and belongs to the form which is called lapidary. Besides,\r\nI formed the opinion afterwards that the writer of the latter part\r\nof the book had been a contemporary of Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThe form and the origin of the writing is so minutely and fully\r\ndescribed in the first part of the book, as it could not be in any\r\nother language. It is very complete, and consists of thirty-four\r\nletters, among which are three separate forms of a and u, and two of\r\ne, i, y, and o, besides four pairs of double consonants--ng, th, ks,\r\nand gs. The ng, which as a nasal sound has no particular mark in any\r\nother Western language, is an indivisible conjunction; the th is soft,\r\nas in English, and is sometimes replaced by d; the gs is seldom met\r\nwith--I believe only in the word segse, to say, in modern Fries sidse,\r\npronounced sisze.\r\n\r\nThe paper, of large quarto size, is made of cotton, not very thick,\r\nwithout water-mark or maker's mark, made upon a frame or wire-web,\r\nwith not very broad perpendicular lines.\r\n\r\nAn introductory letter gives the year 1256 as that in which\r\nthis manuscript was written by Hiddo overa Linda on foreign\r\npaper. Consequently it must have come from Spain, where the Arabs\r\nbrought into the market paper manufactured from cotton.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, W. Wattenbach writes in his \"Das Schriftwesen im\r\nMittelalter\" (Leipzig, 1871), s. 93:--\r\n\r\n\"The manufacture of paper from cotton must have been in use among the\r\nChinese from very remote times, and must have become known to the\r\nArabs by the conquest of Samarcand about the year 704. In Damascus\r\nthis manufacture was an important branch of industry, for which reason\r\nit was called Charta Damascena. By the Arabians this art was brought\r\nto the Greeks. It is asserted that Greek manuscripts of the tenth\r\ncentury written upon cotton paper exist, and that in the thirteenth\r\ncentury it was much more used than parchment. To distinguish it from\r\nEgyptian paper it was called Charta bombicina, gossypina, cuttunea,\r\nxylina. A distinction from linen paper was not yet necessary. In the\r\nmanufacture of the cotton paper raw cotton was originally used. We\r\nfirst find paper from rags mentioned by Petrus Clusiacensis (1122-50).\r\n\r\n\"The Spaniards and the Italians learned the manufacture of this paper\r\nfrom the Arabians. The most celebrated factories were at Jativa,\r\nValencia, Toledo, besides Fabriano in the March of Ancona.\" [1]\r\n\r\nIn Germany the use of this material did not become very extended,\r\nwhether it came from Italy or Spain. Therefore the further this\r\npreparation spread from the East and the adjoining countries,\r\nthe more necessity there was that linen should take the place of\r\ncotton. A document of Kaufbeuren on linen paper of the year 1318\r\nis of very doubtful genuineness. Bodman considers the oldest pure\r\nlinen paper to be of the year 1324, but up to 1350 much mixed paper\r\nwas used. All carefully-written manuscripts of great antiquity show\r\nby the regularity of their lines that they must have been ruled,\r\neven though no traces of the ruled lines can be distinguished. To\r\nmake the lines they used a thin piece of lead, a ruler, and a pair\r\nof compasses to mark the distances.\r\n\r\nIn old writings the ink is very black or brown; but while there has\r\nbeen more writing since the thirteenth century, the colour of the ink\r\nis often grey or yellowish, and sometimes quite pale, showing that it\r\ncontains iron. All this affords convincing proof that the manuscript\r\nbefore us belongs to the middle of the thirteenth century, written with\r\nclear black letters between fine lines carefully traced with lead. The\r\ncolour of the ink shows decidedly that it does not contain iron. By\r\nthese evidences the date given, 1256, is satisfactorily proved, and\r\nit is impossible to assign any later date. Therefore all suspicion\r\nof modern deception vanishes.\r\n\r\nThe language is very old Fries, still older and purer than the Fries\r\nRjuchtboek or old Fries laws, differing from that both in form and\r\nspelling, so that it appears to be an entirely distinct dialect,\r\nand shows that the locality of the language must have been (as it\r\nwas spoken) between the Vlie and the Scheldt.\r\n\r\nThe style is extremely simple, concise, and unembarrassed, resembling\r\nthat of ordinary conversation, and free in the choice of the words. The\r\nspelling is also simple and easy, so that the reading of it does\r\nnot involve the least difficulty, and yet with all its regularity,\r\nso unrestricted, that each of the separate writers who have worked\r\nat the book has his own peculiarities, arising from the changes in\r\npronunciation in a long course of years, which naturally must have\r\nhappened, as the last part of the work is written five centuries\r\nafter the first.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of antiquity in language and writing, I believe I may\r\nventure to say that this book is unique of its kind.\r\n\r\nThe writing suggests an observation which may be of great importance.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks know and acknowledge that their writing was not their\r\nown invention. They attribute the introduction of it to Kadmus, a\r\nPhenician. The names of their oldest letters, from Alpha to Tau, agree\r\nso exactly with the names of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet, with\r\nwhich the Phenician will have been nearly connected, that we cannot\r\ndoubt that the Hebrew was the origin of the Phenician. But the form\r\nof their letters differs so entirely from that of the Phenician and\r\nHebrew writing, that in that particular no connection can be thought\r\nof between them. Whence, then, have the Greeks derived the form of\r\ntheir letters?\r\n\r\nFrom \"thet bok thêra Adela folstar\" (\"The Book of Adela's Followers\")\r\nwe learn that in the time when Kadmus is said to have lived, about\r\nsixteen centuries before Christ, a brisk trade existed between the\r\nFrisians and the Phenicians, whom they named Kadhemar, or dwellers\r\non the coast.\r\n\r\nThe name Kadmus comes too near the word Kadhemar for us not to believe\r\nthat Kadmus simply meant a Phenician.\r\n\r\nFurther on we learn that about the same time a priestess of the castle\r\nin the island of Walcheren, Min-erva, also called Nyhellenia, had\r\nsettled in Attica at the head of a Frisian colony, and had founded\r\na castle at Athens. Also, from the accounts written on the walls of\r\nWaraburch, that the Finns likewise had a writing of their own--a\r\nvery troublesome and difficult one to read--and that, therefore,\r\nthe Tyrians and the Greeks had learned the writing of Frya. By this\r\nrepresentation the whole thing explains itself, and it becomes clear\r\nwhence comes the exterior resemblance between the Greek and the old\r\nFries writing, which Cæsar also remarked among the Gauls; as likewise\r\nin what manner the Greeks acquired and retained the names of the Finn\r\nand the forms of the Fries writing.\r\n\r\nEqually remarkable are the forms of their figures. We usually call\r\nour figures Arabian, although they have not the least resemblance\r\nto those used by the Arabs. The Arabians did not bring their ciphers\r\nfrom the East, because the Semitic nations used the whole alphabet in\r\nwriting numbers. The manner of expressing all numbers by ten signs\r\nthe Arabs learned in the West, though the form was in some measure\r\ncorresponding with their writing, and was written from left to right,\r\nafter the Western fashion. Our ciphers seem here to have sprung from\r\nthe Fries ciphers (siffar), which form had the same origin as the\r\nhandwriting, and is derived from the lines of the Juul?\r\n\r\nThe book as it lies before us consists of two parts, differing widely\r\nfrom each other, and of dates very far apart. The writer of the\r\nfirst part calls herself Adela, wife of Apol, chief man of the Linda\r\ncountry. This is continued by her son Adelbrost, and her daughter\r\nApollonia. The first book, running from page 1 to 88, is written by\r\nAdela. The following part, from 88 to 94, is begun by Adelbrost and\r\ncontinued by Apollonia. The second book, running from page 94 to 114,\r\nis written by Apollonia. Much later, perhaps two hundred and fifty\r\nyears, a third book is written, from page 114 to 134, by Frethorik;\r\nthen follows from page 134 to 143, written by his widow, Wiljow;\r\nafter that from page 144 to 169 by their son, Konereed; and then\r\nfrom page 169 to 192 by their grandson, Beeden. Pages 193 and 194,\r\nwith which the last part must have begun, are wanting, therefore the\r\nwriter is unknown. He may probably have been a son of Beeden.\r\n\r\nOn page 134, Wiljow makes mention of another writing of Adela. These\r\nshe names \"thet bok thêra sanga (thet boek), thêra tellinga,\" and \"thet\r\nHellênia bok;\" and afterwards \"tha skrifta fon Adela jeftha Hellênia.\"\r\n\r\nTo fix the date we must start from the year 1256 of our era, when Hiddo\r\novera Linda made the copy, in which he says that it was 3449 years\r\nafter Atland was sunk. This disappearance of the old land (âldland,\r\nâtland) was known by the Greeks, for Plato mentions in his \"Timæus,\"\r\n24, the disappearance of Atlantis, the position of which was only known\r\nas somewhere far beyond the Pillars of Hercules. From this writing it\r\nappears that it was land stretching far out to the west of Jutland,\r\nof which Heligoland and the islands of North Friesland are the last\r\nbarren remnants. This event, which occasioned a great dispersion of\r\nthe Frisian race, became the commencement of a chronological reckoning\r\ncorresponding with 2193 before Christ, and is known by geologists as\r\nthe Cimbrian flood.\r\n\r\nOn page 80 begins an account in the year 1602, after the disappearance\r\nof Atland, and thus in the year 591 before Christ; and on page 82 is\r\nthe account of the murder of Frâna, \"Eeremoeder,\" of Texland two years\r\nlater--that is, in 589. When, therefore, Adela commences her writing\r\nwith her own coming forward in an assembly of the people thirty years\r\nafter the murder of the Eeremoeder, that must have been in the year\r\n559 before Christ. In the part written by her daughter Apollonia, we\r\nfind that fifteen months after the assembly Adela was killed by the\r\nFinns in an attack by surprise of Texland. This must accordingly have\r\nhappened 557 years before Christ. Hence it follows that the first book,\r\nwritten by Adela, was of the year 558 before Christ. The second book,\r\nby Apollonia, we may assign to about the year 530 before Christ. The\r\nlatter part contains the history of the known kings of Friesland,\r\nFriso, Adel (Ubbo), and Asega Askar, called Black Adel. Of the third\r\nking, Ubbo, nothing is said, or rather that part is lost, as the pages\r\n169 to 188 are missing. Frethorik, the first writer, who appears now,\r\nwas a contemporary of the occurrences which he relates, namely,\r\nthe arrival of Friso. He was a friend of Liudgert den Geertman,\r\nwho, as rear-admiral of the fleet of Wichhirte, the sea-king, had\r\ncome with Friso in the year 303 before Christ, 1890 years after the\r\ndisappearance of Atland. He has borrowed most of his information from\r\nthe log-book of Liudgert.\r\n\r\nThe last writer gives himself out most clearly as a contemporary of\r\nBlack Adel or Askar, about the middle of his reign, which Furmerius\r\nstates to have been from 70 before Christ to 11 after the birth of\r\nChrist, the same period as Julius Cæsar and Augustus. He therefore\r\nwrote in the middle of the last century before Christ, and knew of\r\nthe conquest of Gaul by the Romans. It is thus evident that there\r\nelapsed fully two centuries between the two parts of the work.\r\n\r\nOf the Gauls we read on page 84 that they were called the \"Missionaries\r\nof Sydon.\" And on page 124 \"that the Gauls are Druids.\" The Gauls,\r\nthen, were Druids, and the name Galli, used for the whole nation,\r\nwas really only the name of an order of priesthood brought from the\r\nEast, just as among the Romans the Galli were priests of Cybele.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole contents of the book are in all respects new. That is to\r\nsay, there is nothing in it that we were acquainted with before. What\r\nwe here read of Friso, Adel, and Askar differs entirely from what\r\nis related by our own chroniclers, or rather presents it in quite\r\nanother light. For instance, they all relate that Friso came from\r\nIndia, and that thus the Frisians were of Indian descent; and yet\r\nthey add that Friso was a German, and belonged to a Persian race which\r\nHerodotus called Germans (Germanioi). According to the statement in\r\nthis book, Friso did come from India, and with the fleet of Nearchus;\r\nbut he is not therefore an Indian. He is of Frisian origin, of Frya's\r\npeople. He belongs, in fact, to a Frisian colony which after the death\r\nof Nijhellênia, fifteen and a half centuries before Christ, under the\r\nguidance of a priestess Geert, settled in the Punjab, and took the\r\nname of Geertmen. The Geertmen were known by only one of the Greek\r\nwriters, Strabo, who mentions them as Germanes, differing totally\r\nand entirely from the Brachmanes in manners, language, and religion.\r\n\r\nThe historians of Alexander's expeditions do not speak of Frisians\r\nor Geertmen, though they mention Indoscythians, thereby describing\r\na people who live in India, but whose origin is in the distant,\r\nunknown North.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts of Liudgert no names are given of places where the\r\nFrieslanders lived in India. We only know that they first established\r\nthemselves to the east of the Punjab, and afterwards moved to the\r\nwest of those rivers. It is mentioned, moreover, as a striking\r\nfact, that in the summer the sun at midday was straight above their\r\nheads. They therefore lived within the tropics. We find in Ptolemy\r\n(see the map of Kiepert), exactly 24° N. on the west side of the Indus,\r\nthe name Minnagara; and about six degrees east of that, in 22° N.,\r\nanother Minnagara. This name is pure Fries, the same as Walhallagara,\r\nFolsgara, and comes from Minna, the name of an Eeremoeder, in whose\r\ntime the voyages of Teunis and his nephew Inca took place.\r\n\r\nThe coincidence is too remarkable to be accidental, and not to\r\nprove that Minnagara was the headquarters of the Frisian colony. The\r\nestablishment of the colonists in the Punjab in 1551 before Christ,\r\nand their journey thither, we find fully described in Adela's book;\r\nand with the mention of one most remarkable circumstance, namely,\r\nthat the Frisian mariners sailed through the strait which in those\r\ntimes still ran into the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nIn Strabo, book i. pages 38 and 50, it appears that Eratosthenes\r\nwas acquainted with the existence of the strait, of which the later\r\ngeographers make no mention. It existed still in the time of Moses\r\n(Exodus xiv. 2), for he encamped at Pi-ha-chiroht, the \"mouth of the\r\nstrait.\" Moreover, Strabo mentions that Sesostris made an attempt\r\nto cut through the isthmus, but that he was not able to accomplish\r\nit. That in very remote times the sea really did flow through is proved\r\nby the result of the geological investigations on the isthmus made by\r\nthe Suez Canal Commission, of which M. Renaud presented a report to\r\nthe Academy of Sciences on the 19th June 1856. In that report, among\r\nother things, appears the following: \"Une question fort controversée\r\nest celle de savoir, si à l'époque où les Hebreux fuyaient de l'Egypte\r\nsous la conduite de Moïse, les lacs amers faisaient encore partie\r\nde la mer rouge. Cette dernière hypothèse s'accorderait mieux que\r\nl'hypothèse contraire avec le texte des livres sacrés, mais alors\r\nil faudrait admettre que depuis l'époque de Moïse le seuil de Suez\r\nserait sorti des eaux.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to this question, it is certainly of importance to fall\r\nin with an account in this Frisian manuscript, from which it seems\r\nthat in the sixteenth century before Christ the connection between\r\nthe Bitter Lakes and the Red Sea still existed, and that the strait\r\nwas still navigable. The manuscript further states that soon after\r\nthe passage of the Geertmen there was an earthquake; that the land\r\nrose so high that all the water ran out, and all the shallows and\r\nalluvial lands rose up like a wall. This must have happened after the\r\ntime of Moses, so that at the date of the Exodus (1564 B.C.) the track\r\nbetween Suez and the Bitter Lakes was still navigable, but could be\r\nforded dry-foot at low water.\r\n\r\nThis point, then, is the commencement of the isthmus, after the forming\r\nof which, the northern inlet was certainly soon filled up as far as\r\nthe Gulf of Pelusium.\r\n\r\nThe map by Louis Figuier, in the \"Année scientifique et industrielle\"\r\n(première année), Paris, Hachette, 1857, gives a distinct illustration\r\nof the formation of this land.\r\n\r\nAnother statement, which occurs only in Strabo, finds also here a\r\nconfirmation. Strabo alone of all the Greek writers relates that\r\nNearchus, after he had landed his troops in the Persian Gulf, at the\r\nmouth of the Pasitigris, sailed out of the Persian Gulf by Alexander's\r\ncommand, and steered round Arabia through the Arabian Gulf. As\r\nthe account stands, it is not clear what Nearchus had to do there,\r\nand what the object of the further voyage was. If, as Strabo seems\r\nto think, it was only for geographical discovery, he need not have\r\ntaken the whole fleet. One or two ships would have sufficed. We do\r\nnot read that he returned. Where, then, did he remain with that fleet?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is to be found in the Frisian version of\r\nthe story. Alexander had bought the ships on the Indus, or had had\r\nthem built by the descendants of the Frisians who settled there--the\r\nGeertmen--and had taken into his service sailors from among them, and\r\nat the head of them was Friso. Alexander having accomplished his voyage\r\nand the transport of his troops, had no further use for the ships in\r\nthe Persian Gulf, but wished to employ them in the Mediterranean. He\r\nhad taken that idea into his head, and it must be carried into\r\neffect. He wished to do what no one had done before him. For this\r\npurpose Nearchus was to sail up the Red Sea, and on his arrival at\r\nSuez was to find 200 elephants, 1000 camels, workmen and materials,\r\ntimber and ropes, &c., in order to haul the ships by land over the\r\nisthmus. This work was carried on and accomplished with so much zeal\r\nand energy that after three months' labour the fleet was launched in\r\nthe Mediterranean. That the fleet really came to the Mediterranean\r\nappears in Plutarch's \"Life of Alexander;\" but he makes Nearchus\r\nbring the fleet round Africa, and sail through the Pillars of Hercules.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat at Actium, Cleopatra, in imitation of this example,\r\ntried to take her fleet over the isthmus in order to escape to India,\r\nbut was prevented by the inhabitants of Arabia Petræa, who burnt her\r\nships. (See Plutarch's \"Life of Antony.\") When Alexander shortly\r\nafterwards died, Friso remained in the service of Antigonus and\r\nDemetrius, until, having been grievously insulted by the latter, he\r\nresolved to seek out with his sailors their fatherland, Friesland. To\r\nIndia he could not, indeed, return.\r\n\r\nThus these accounts chime in with and clear up each other, and in\r\nthat way afford a mutual confirmation of the events.\r\n\r\nSuch simple narratives and surprising results led me to conclude that\r\nwe had to do here with more than mere Saga and Legends.\r\n\r\nSince the last twenty years attention has been directed to the\r\nremains of the dwellings on piles, first observed in the Swiss lakes,\r\nand afterwards in other parts of Europe. (See Dr E. Rückert, \"Die\r\nPfahlbauten;\" Würzburg, 1869. Dr T. C. Winkler, in the \"Volksalmanak,\"\r\nt. N. v. A. 1867.) When they were found, endeavours were made to\r\ndiscover, by the existing fragments of arms, tools, and household\r\narticles, by whom and when these dwellings had been inhabited. There\r\nare no accounts of them in historical writers, beyond what Herodotus\r\nwrites in book v. chapter 16, of the \"Paeonen.\" The only trace that\r\nhas been found is in one of the panels of Trajan's Pillar, in which\r\nthe destruction of a pile village in Dacia is represented.\r\n\r\nDoubly important, therefore, is it to learn from the writing\r\nof Apollonia that she, as \"Burgtmaagd\" (chief of the virgins),\r\nabout 540 years before Christ, made a journey up the Rhine to\r\nSwitzerland, and there became acquainted with the Lake Dwellers\r\n(Marsaten). She describes their dwellings built upon piles--the\r\npeople themselves--their manners and customs. She relates that they\r\nlived by fishing and hunting, and that they prepared the skins of the\r\nanimals with the bark of the birch-tree in order to sell the furs\r\nto the Rhine boatmen, who brought them into commerce. This account\r\nof the pile dwellings in the Swiss lakes can only have been written\r\nin the time when these dwellings still existed and were lived in. In\r\nthe second part of the writing, Konerêd oera Linda relates that Adel,\r\nthe son of Friso (±250 years before Christ), visited the pile dwellings\r\nin Switzerland with his wife Ifkja.\r\n\r\nLater than this account there is no mention by any writer whatever of\r\nthe pile dwellings, and the subject has remained for twenty centuries\r\nutterly unknown until 1853, when an extraordinary low state of the\r\nwater led to the discovery of these dwellings. Therefore no one could\r\nhave invented this account in the intervening period. Although a great\r\nportion of the first part of the work--the book of Adela--belongs to\r\nthe mythological period before the Trojan war, there is a striking\r\ndifference between it and the Greek myths. The Myths have no dates,\r\nmuch less any chronology, nor any internal coherence of successive\r\nevents. The untrammelled fancy develops itself in every poem separately\r\nand independently. The mythological stories contradict each other on\r\nevery point. \"Les Mythes ne se tiennent pas,\" is the only key to the\r\nGreek Mythology.\r\n\r\nHere, on the contrary, we meet with a regular succession of dates\r\nstarting from a fixed period--the destruction of Atland, 2193\r\nbefore Christ. The accounts are natural and simple, often naïve,\r\nnever contradict each other, and are always consistent with each\r\nother in time and place. As, for instance, the arrival and sojourn\r\nof Ulysses with the Burgtmaagd Kalip at Walhallagara (Walcheren),\r\nwhich is the most mythical portion of all, is here said to be 1005\r\nyears after the disappearance of Atland, which coincides with 1188\r\nyears before Christ, and thus agrees very nearly with the time at\r\nwhich the Greeks say the Trojan war took place. The story of Ulysses\r\nwas not brought here for the first time by the Romans. Tacitus found\r\nit already in Lower Germany (see \"Germania,\" cap. 3), and says that\r\nat Asciburgium there was an altar on which the names of Ulysses and\r\nhis father Laërtes were inscribed.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable difference consists in this, that the Myths know\r\nno origin, do not name either writers or relaters of their stories,\r\nand therefore never can bring forward any authority. Whereas in\r\nAdela's book, for every statement is given a notice where it was\r\nfound or whence it was taken. For instance, \"This comes from Minno's\r\nwritings--this is written on the walls of Waraburch--this in the town\r\nof Frya--this at Stavia--this at Walhallagara.\"\r\n\r\nThere is also this further. Laws, regular legislative enactments, such\r\nas are found in great numbers in Adela's book, are utterly unknown\r\nin Mythology, and indeed are irreconcilable with its existence. Even\r\nwhen the Myth attributes to Minos the introduction of lawgiving in\r\nCrete, it does not give the least account of what the legislation\r\nconsisted in. Also among the Gods of Mythology there existed no system\r\nof laws. The only law was unchangable Destiny and the will of the\r\nsupreme Zeus.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Mythology, this writing, which bears no\r\nmythical character, is not less remarkable than with regard to\r\nhistory. Notwithstanding the frequent and various relations with\r\nDenmark, Sweden, and Norway, we do not find any traces of acquaintance\r\nwith the Northern or Scandinavian Mythology. Only Wodin appears in the\r\nperson of Wodan, a chief of the Frisians, who became the son-in-law\r\nof one Magy, King of the Finns, and after his death was deified.\r\n\r\nThe Frisian religion is extremely simple, and pure Monotheism. Wr-alda\r\nor Wr-alda's spirit is the only eternal, unchangeable, perfect, and\r\nalmighty being. Wr-alda has created everything. Out of him proceeds\r\neverything--first the beginning, then time, and afterwards Irtha,\r\nthe Earth. Irtha bore three daughters--Lyda, Finda, and Frya--the\r\nmothers of the three distinct races, black, yellow, and white--Africa,\r\nAsia, and Europe. As such, Frya is the mother of Frya's people, the\r\nFrieslanders. She is the representative of Wr-alda, and is reverenced\r\naccordingly. Frya has established her \"Tex,\" the first law, and has\r\nestablished the religion of the eternal light. The worship consists in\r\nthe maintenance of a perpetually-burning lamp, foddik, by priestesses,\r\nvirgins. At the head of the virgins in every town was a Burgtmaagd,\r\nand the chief of the Burgtmaagden was the Eeremoeder of the Fryasburgt\r\nof Texland. The Eeremoeder governs the whole country. The kings can do\r\nnothing, nor can anything happen without her advice and approval. The\r\nfirst Eeremoeder was appointed by Frya herself, and was called\r\nFâsta. In fact, we find here the prototype of the Roman Vestal Virgins.\r\n\r\nWe are reminded here of Velleda (Welda) and Aurinia in Tacitus\r\n(\"Germania,\" 8. Hist., iv. 61, 65; v. 22, 24. \"Annals,\" i. 54),\r\nand of Gauna, the successor of Velleda, in Dio Cassius (Fragments,\r\n49). Tacitus speaks of the town of Velleda as \"edita turris,\" page\r\n146. It was the town Mannagarda forda (Munster).\r\n\r\nIn the county of the Marsians he speaks of the temple Tanfane\r\n(Tanfanc), so called from the sign of the Juul. (See plate I.)\r\n\r\nThe last of these towns was Fâstaburgt in Ameland, temple Foste,\r\ndestroyed, according to Occa Scarlensis, in 806.\r\n\r\nIf we find among the Frisians a belief in a Godhead and ideas of\r\nreligion entirely different from the Mythology of other nations, we are\r\nthe more surprised to find in some points the closest connection with\r\nthe Greek and Roman Mythology, and even with the origin of two deities\r\nof the highest rank, Min-erva and Neptune. Min-erva (Athénè) was\r\noriginally a Burgtmaagd, priestess of Frya, at the town Walhallagara,\r\nMiddelburg, or Domburg, in Walcheren. And this Min-erva is at the\r\nsame time the mysterious enigmatical goddess of whose worship scarcely\r\nany traces remain beyond the votive stones at Domburg, in Walcheren,\r\nNehallenia, of whom no mythology knows anything more than the name,\r\nwhich etymology has used for all sorts of fantastical derivations. [2]\r\n\r\nThe other, Neptune, called by the Etrurians Nethunus, the God of\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea, appears here to have been, when living,\r\na Friesland Viking, or sea-king, whose home was Alderga (Ouddorp,\r\nnot far from Alkmaar). His name was Teunis, called familiarly by\r\nhis followers Neef Teunis, or Cousin Teunis, who had chosen the\r\nMediterranean as the destination of his expeditions, and must have\r\nbeen deified by the Tyrians at the time when the Phenician navigators\r\nbegan to extend their voyages so remarkably, sailing to Friesland in\r\norder to obtain British tin, northern iron, and amber from the Baltic,\r\nabout 2000 years before Christ.\r\n\r\nBesides these two we meet with a third mythological person--Minos,\r\nthe lawgiver of Crete, who likewise appears to have been a Friesland\r\nsea-king, Minno, born at Lindaoord, between Wieringen and Kreyl,\r\nwho imparted to the Cretans an \"Asagaboek.\" He is that Minos who,\r\nwith his brother Rhadamanthus and Æacus, presided as judges over the\r\nfates of the ghosts in Hades, and must not be confounded with the\r\nlater Minos, the contemporary of Ægeus and Theseus, who appears in\r\nthe Athenian fables.\r\n\r\nThe reader may perhaps be inclined to laugh at these statements,\r\nand apply to me the words that I myself have lately used, fantastic\r\nand improbable. Indeed at first I could not believe my own eyes,\r\nand yet after further consideration I arrived at the discovery of\r\nextraordinary conformities which render the case much less improbable\r\nthan the birth of Min-erva from the head of Jupiter by a blow from\r\nthe axe of Hephæstus, for instance.\r\n\r\nIn the Greek Mythology all the gods and goddesses have a youthful\r\nperiod. Pallas alone has no youth. She is not otherwise known than\r\nadult. Min-erva appears in Attica as high priestess from a foreign\r\ncountry, a country unknown to the Greeks. Pallas is a virgin goddess,\r\nMin-erva is a Burgtmaagd. The fair, blue-eyed Pallas, differing thus\r\nin type from the rest of the gods and goddesses, evidently belonged\r\nto Frya's people. The character for wisdom and the emblematical\r\nattributes, especially the owl, are the same for both. Pallas\r\ngives to the new town her own name, Athènai, which has no meaning\r\nin Greek. Min-erva gives to the town built by her the name Athene,\r\nwhich has an important meaning in Fries, namely, that they came there\r\nas friends--\"Âthen.\"\r\n\r\nMin-erva came to Attica about 1600 years before Christ, the period\r\nat which the Grecian Mythology was beginning to be formed. Min-erva\r\nlanded with the fleet of Jon at the head of a colony in Attica. In\r\nlater times we find her on the Roman votive stones in Walcheren,\r\nunder the name of Nehallenia, worshipped as a goddess of navigation;\r\nand Pallas is worshipped by the Athenians as the protecting goddess\r\nof shipbuilding and navigation.\r\n\r\nTime is the carrier who must eternally turn the \"Jol\" (wheel) and\r\ncarry the sun along his course through the firmament from winter\r\nto winter, thus forming the year, every turn of the wheel being a\r\nday. In midwinter the \"Jolfeest\" is celebrated on Frya's Day. Then\r\ncakes are baked in the form of the sun's wheel, because with the Jol\r\nFrya formed the letters when she wrote her \"Tex.\" The Jolfeest is\r\ntherefore also in honour of Frya as inventor of writing.\r\n\r\nJust as this Jolfeest has been changed by Christianity into\r\nChristmas throughout Denmark and Germany, and into St Nicholas' Day\r\nin Holland; so, certainly, our St Nicholas' dolls--the lover and his\r\nsweetheart--are a memorial of Frya, and the St Nicholas letters a\r\nmemorial of Frya's invention of letters formed from the wheel.\r\n\r\nI cannot analyse the whole contents of this writing, and must content\r\nmyself with the remarks that I have made. They will give an idea of the\r\nrichness and importance of the contents. If some of it is fabulous,\r\neven as fabulous it must have an interest for us, since so little of\r\nthe traditions of our forefathers remains to us.\r\n\r\nAn internal evidence of the antiquity of these writings may be\r\nfound in the fact that the name Batavians had not yet been used. The\r\ninhabitants of the whole country as far as the Scheldt are Frya's\r\npeople--Frieslanders. The Batavians are not a separate people. The\r\nname Batavi is of Roman origin. The Romans gave it to the inhabitants\r\nof the banks of the Waal, which river bears the name Patabus in the\r\n\"Tabula Pentingeriana.\" The name Batavi does not appear earlier than\r\nTacitus and Pliny, and is interpolated in Cæsar's \"Bello Gallico,\"\r\niv. 10. (See my treatise on the course of the rivers through the\r\ncountries of the Frisians and Batavians, p. 49, in \"De Vrije Fries,\"\r\n4th vol. 1st part, 1845.)\r\n\r\nI will conclude with one more remark regarding the language. Those\r\nwho have been able to take only a superficial view of the manuscript\r\nhave been struck by the polish of the language, and its conformity\r\nwith the present Friesland language and Dutch. In this they seem to\r\nfind grounds for doubting the antiquity of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nBut, I ask, is, then, the language of Homer much less polished than\r\nthat of Plato or Demosthenes? And does not the greatest portion of\r\nHomer's vocabulary exist in the Greek of our day?\r\n\r\nIt is true that language alters with time, and is continually subject\r\nto slight variations, owing to which language is found to be different\r\nat different epochs. This change in the language in this manuscript\r\naccordingly gives ground for important observations to philologists. It\r\nis not only that of the eight writers who have successively worked\r\nat the book, each is recognisable by slight peculiarities in style,\r\nlanguage, and spelling; but more particularly between the two parts\r\nof the book, between which an interval of more than two centuries\r\noccurs, a striking difference of the language is visible, which\r\nshows what a slowly progressive regulation it has undergone in that\r\nperiod of time. As the result of these considerations, I arrive at the\r\nconclusion that I cannot find any reason to doubt the authenticity of\r\nthese writings. They cannot be forgeries. In the first place, the copy\r\nof 1256 cannot be. Who could at that time have forged anything of that\r\nkind? Certainly no one. Still less any one at an earlier date. At a\r\nlater date a forgery is equally impossible, for the simple reason that\r\nno one was acquainted with the language. Except Grimm, Richthofen,\r\nand Hettema, no one can be named sufficiently versed in that branch\r\nof philology, or who had studied the language so as to be able to\r\nwrite in it. And if any one could have done so, there would have been\r\nno more extensive vocabulary at his service than that which the East\r\nFrisian laws afford. Therefore, in the centuries lately elapsed, the\r\npreparation of this writing was quite impossible. Whoever doubts this\r\nlet him begin by showing where, when, by whom, and with what object\r\nsuch a forgery could be committed, and let him show in modern times\r\nthe fellow of this paper, this writing, and this language.\r\n\r\nMoreover, that the manuscript of 1256 is not original, but is a copy,\r\nis proved by the numerous faults in the writing, as well as by some\r\nexplanations of words which already in the time of the copyist had\r\nbecome obsolete and little known, as, for instance, in page 82 (114),\r\n\"to thêra flête jefta bedrum;\" page 151 (204), \"bargum jefta tonnum\r\nfon tha besta bjar.\"\r\n\r\nA still stronger proof is that between pages 157 and 158 one or more\r\npages are missing, which cannot have been lost out of this manuscript,\r\nbecause the pages 157 and 158 are on the front and the back of the\r\nsame leaf.\r\n\r\nPage 157 finishes thus: \"Three months afterwards Adel sent messengers\r\nto all the friends that he had gained, and requested them to send\r\nhim intelligent people in the month of May.\" When we turn over the\r\nleaf, the other side begins, \"his wife, he said, who had been Maid\r\nof Texland, had got a copy of it.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no connection between these two. There is wanting, at least,\r\nthe arrival of the invited, and an account of what passed at their\r\nmeeting. It is clear, therefore, that the copyist must have turned\r\nover two pages of the original instead of one. There certainly existed\r\nthen an earlier manuscript, and that was doubtless written by Liko\r\noera Linda in the year 803.\r\n\r\nWe may thus accept that we possess in this manuscript, of which\r\nthe first part was composed in the sixth century before our era, the\r\noldest production, after Homer and Hesiod, of European literature, And\r\nhere we find in our fatherland a very ancient people in possession of\r\ndevelopment, civilization, industry, navigation, commerce, literature,\r\nand pure elevated ideas of religion, whose existence we had never even\r\nconjectured. Hitherto we have believed that the historical records\r\nof our people reach no farther back than the arrival of Friso the\r\npresumptive founder of the Frisians, whereas here we become aware\r\nthat these records mount up to more than 2000 years before Christ,\r\nsurpassing the antiquity of Hellas and equalling that of Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This paper was read at a meeting of the Frisian Society,\r\n    February. 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE SAMPLE\r\n\r\nOF THE OLD FRISIAN LAWS, AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE MANUSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDyo forme need is: hweerso en kynd jongh is finsen ende fitered\r\nnoerd wr hef, jefta (sud) wr birgh.

They are very insinuating, but they\r\ndestroy in an underhand manner all that relates to us Frisians. In\r\norder to gain rich benefices, they conspire with foreign kings, who\r\nknow that we are their greatest enemies, because we dare to speak to\r\ntheir people of liberty, rights, and the duties of princes. Therefore\r\nthey seek to destroy all that we derive from our forefathers, and\r\nall that is left of our old customs.\r\n\r\nAh, my beloved ones! I have visited their courts! If Wr-alda permits\r\nit, and we do not shew ourselves strong to resist, they will altogether\r\nexterminate us.\r\n\r\nLiko, surnamed over de Linda.\r\n\r\nWritten at Liudwert, Anno Domini 803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF ADELA'S FOLLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty years after the day on which the Volksmoeder was murdered by\r\nthe commander Magy, was a time of great distress. All the states that\r\nlie on the other side of the Weser had been wrested from us, and had\r\nfallen under the power of Magy, and it looked as if his power was to\r\nbecome supreme over the whole land. To avert this misfortune a general\r\nassembly of the people was summoned, which was attended by all the\r\nmen who stood in good repute with the Maagden (priestesses). Then at\r\nthe end of three days the whole council was in confusion, and in the\r\nsame position as when they came together. Thereupon Adela demanded\r\nto be heard, and said:--\r\n\r\nYou all know that I was three years Burgtmaagd. You know also that\r\nI was chosen for Volksmoeder, and that I refused to be Volksmoeder\r\nbecause I wished to marry Apol; but what you do not know is, that I\r\nhave watched everything that has happened, as if I had really been\r\nyour Volksmoeder. I have constantly travelled about, observing what\r\nwas going on. By that means I have become acquainted with many things\r\nthat others do not know. You said yesterday that our relatives on\r\nthe other side of the Weser were dull and cowardly; but I may tell\r\nyou that the Magy has not won a single village from them by force of\r\narms; but only by detestable deceit, and still more by the rapacity\r\nof their dukes and nobles.\r\n\r\nFrya has said we must not admit amongst us any but free people; but\r\nwhat have they done? They have imitated our enemies, and instead of\r\nkilling their prisoners, or letting them go free, they have despised\r\nthe counsel of Frya, and have made slaves of them.\r\n\r\nBecause they have acted thus, Frya cared no longer to watch over\r\nthem. They robbed others of their freedom, and therefore lost\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nThis is well known to you, but I will tell you how they came to sink\r\nso low. The Finn women had children. These grew up with our free\r\nchildren. They played and gamboled together in the fields, and were\r\nalso together by the hearth.\r\n\r\nThere they learned with pleasure the loose ways of the Finns, because\r\nthey were bad and new; and thus they became denationalised in spite of\r\nthe efforts of their parents. When the children grew up, and saw that\r\nthe children of the Finns handled no weapons, and scarcely worked,\r\nthey took a distaste for work, and became proud.\r\n\r\nThe principal men and their cleverest sons made up to the wanton\r\ndaughters of the Finns; and their own daughters, led astray by this bad\r\nexample, allowed themselves to be beguiled by the handsome young Finns\r\nin derision of their depraved fathers. When the Magy found this out,\r\nhe took the handsomest of his Finns and Magyars, and promised them\r\n\"red cows with golden horns\" to let themselves be taken prisoners\r\nby our people in order to spread his doctrines. His people did even\r\nmore. Children disappeared, were taken away to the uplands, and after\r\nthey had been brought up in his pernicious doctrines, were sent back.\r\n\r\nWhen these pretended prisoners had learned our language, they\r\npersuaded the dukes and nobles that they should become subject to the\r\nMagy--that then their sons would succeed to them without having to\r\nbe elected. Those who by their good deeds had gained a piece of land\r\nin front of their house, they promised on their side should receive\r\nin addition a piece behind; those who had got a piece before and\r\nbehind, should have a rondeel (complete circuit); and those who had\r\na rondeel should have a whole freehold. If the seniors were true to\r\nFrya, then they changed their course, and turned to the degenerate\r\nsons. Yesterday there were among you those who would have called\r\nthe whole people together, to compel the eastern states to return to\r\ntheir duty. According to my humble opinion, they would have made a\r\ngreat mistake. Suppose that there was a very serious epidemic among\r\nthe cattle, would you run the risk of sending your own healthy cattle\r\namong the sick ones? Certainly not. Every one must see that doing\r\nthat would turn out very badly for the whole of the cattle. Who, then,\r\nwould be so imprudent as to send their children among a people wholly\r\ndepraved? If I were to give you any advice, it would be to choose a\r\nnew Volksmoeder. I know that you are in a difficulty about it, because\r\nout of the thirteen Burgtmaagden that we still have remaining, eight\r\nare candidates for the dignity; but I should pay no attention to that.\r\n\r\nTeuntia, the Burgtmaagd of Medeasblik, who is not a candidate, is a\r\nperson of knowledge and sound sense, and quite as attached to our\r\npeople and our customs as all the rest together. I should farther\r\nrecommend that you should visit all the citadels, and write down all\r\nthe laws of Frya's Tex, as well as all the histories, and all that\r\nis written on the walls, in order that it may not be destroyed with\r\nthe citadels.\r\n\r\nIt stands written that every Volksmoeder and every Burgtmaagd\r\nshall have assistants and messengers--twenty-one maidens and seven\r\napprentices.\r\n\r\nIf I might add more, I would recommend that all the respectable girls\r\nin the towns should be taught; for I say positively, and time will\r\nshow it, that if you wish to remain true children of Frya, never to\r\nbe vanquished by fraud or arms, you must take care to bring up your\r\ndaughters as true Frya's daughters.\r\n\r\nYou must teach the children how great our country has been, what\r\ngreat men our forefathers were, how great we still are, if we compare\r\nourselves to others.\r\n\r\nYou must tell them of the sea-heroes, of their mighty deeds and\r\ndistant voyages. All these stories must be told by the fireside and\r\nin the field, wherever it may be, in times of joy or sorrow; and if\r\nyou wish to impress it on the brains and the hearts of your sons,\r\nyou must let it flow through the lips of your wives and your daughters.\r\n\r\nAdela's advice was followed.\r\n\r\nThese are the Grevetmen under whose direction this book is composed:--\r\n\r\nApol, Adela's husband; three times a sea-king; Grevetman of Ostflyland\r\nand Lindaoorden. The towns Liudgarda, Lindahem, and Stavia are under\r\nhis care.\r\n\r\nThe Saxman Storo, Sytia's husband; Grevetman over the Hoogefennen and\r\nWouden. Nine times he was chosen as duke or heerman (commander). The\r\ntowns Buda and Manna-garda-forda are under his care.\r\n\r\nAbêlo, Jaltia's husband; Grevetman over the Zuiderfly-landen. He was\r\nthree times heerman. The towns Aken, Liudburg, and Katsburg are under\r\nhis care.\r\n\r\nEnoch, Dywcke's husband; Grevetman over Westflyland and Texel. He\r\nwas chosen nine times for sea-king. Waraburg, Medeasblik, Forana,\r\nand Fryasburg are under his care.\r\n\r\nFoppe, Dunroo's husband; Grevetman over the seven islands. He was\r\nfive times sea-king. The town Walhallagara is under his care.\r\n\r\nThis was inscribed upon the walls of Fryasburg in Texland, as well\r\nas at Stavia and Medeasblik.\r\n\r\nIt was Frya's day, and seven times seven years had elapsed since\r\nFesta was appointed Volksmoeder by the desire of Frya. The citadel of\r\nMedeasblik was ready, and a Burgtmaagd was chosen. Festa was about to\r\nlight her new lamp, and when she had done so in the presence of all\r\nthe people, Frya called from her watch-star, so that every one could\r\nhear it: \"Festa, take your style and write the things, that I may not\r\nspeak.\" Festa did as she was bid, and thus we became Frya's children,\r\nand our earliest history began.\r\n\r\nThis is our earliest history.\r\n\r\nWr-alda, who alone is eternal and good, made the beginning. Then\r\ncommenced time. Time wrought all things, even the earth. The earth\r\nbore grass, herbs, and trees, all useful and all noxious animals. All\r\nthat is good and useful she brought forth by day, and all that is\r\nbad and injurious by night.\r\n\r\nAfter the twelfth Juulfeest she brought forth three maidens:--\r\n\r\nLyda out of fierce heat.\r\n\r\nFinda out of strong heat.\r\n\r\nFrya out of moderate heat.\r\n\r\nWhen the last came into existence, Wr-alda breathed his spirit upon\r\nher in order that men might be bound to him. As soon as they were\r\nfull grown they took pleasure and delight in the visions of Wr-alda.\r\n\r\nHatred found its way among them.\r\n\r\nThey each bore twelve sons and twelve daughters--at every Juul-time\r\na couple. Thence come all mankind.\r\n\r\nLyda was black, with hair curled like a lamb's; her eyes shone like\r\nstars, and shot out glances like those of a bird of prey.\r\n\r\nLyda was acute. She could hear a snake glide, and could smell a fish\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nLyda was strong and nimble. She could bend a large tree, yet when\r\nshe walked she did not bruise a flower-stalk.\r\n\r\nLyda was violent. Her voice was loud, and when she screamed in anger\r\nevery creature quailed.\r\n\r\nWonderful Lyda! She had no regard for laws; her actions were governed\r\nby her passions. To help the weak she would kill the strong, and when\r\nshe had done it she would weep by their bodies.\r\n\r\nPoor Lyda! She turned grey by her mad behaviour, and at last she died\r\nheart-broken by the wickedness of her children. Foolish children! They\r\naccused each other of their mother's death. They howled and fought\r\nlike wolves, and while they did this the birds devoured the corpse. Who\r\ncan refrain from tears at such a recital?\r\n\r\nFinda was yellow, and her hair was like the mane of a horse. She\r\ncould not bend a tree, but where Lyda killed one lion she killed ten.\r\n\r\nFinda was seductive. Her voice was sweeter than any bird's. Her\r\neyes were alluring and enticing, but whoever looked upon them became\r\nher slave.\r\n\r\nFinda was unreasonable. She wrote thousands of laws, but she never\r\nobeyed one. She despised the frankness of the good, and gave herself\r\nup to flatterers.\r\n\r\nThat was her misfortune. Her head was too full, but her heart was too\r\nvain. She loved nobody but herself, and she wished that all should\r\nlove her.\r\n\r\nFalse Finda! Honey-sweet were her words, but those who trusted them\r\nfound sorrow at hand.\r\n\r\nSelfish Finda! She wished to rule everybody, and her sons were like\r\nher. They made their sisters serve them, and they slew each other\r\nfor the mastery.\r\n\r\nTreacherous Finda! One wrong word would irritate her, and the\r\ncruellest deeds did not affect her. If she saw a lizard swallow a\r\nspider, she shuddered; but if she saw her children kill a Frisian,\r\nher bosom swelled with pleasure.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate Finda! She died in the bloom of her age, and the mode of\r\nher death is unknown.\r\n\r\nHypocritical children! Her corpse was buried under a costly stone,\r\npompous inscriptions were written on it, and loud lamentations were\r\nheard at it, but in private not a tear was shed.\r\n\r\nDespicable people! The laws that Finda established were written\r\non golden tables, but the object for which they were made was never\r\nattained. The good laws were abolished, and selfishness instituted bad\r\nones in their place. O Finda! then the earth overflowed with blood,\r\nand your children were mown down like grass. Yes, Finda! those were\r\nthe fruits of your vanity. Look down from your watch-star and weep.\r\n\r\nFrya was white like the snow at sunrise, and the blue of her eyes\r\nvied with the rainbow.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Frya! Like the rays of the sun shone the locks of her hair,\r\nwhich were as fine as spiders' webs.\r\n\r\nClever Frya! When she opened her lips the birds ceased to sing and\r\nthe leaves to quiver.\r\n\r\nPowerful Frya! At the glance of her eye the lion lay down at her feet\r\nand the adder withheld his poison.\r\n\r\nPure Frya! Her food was honey, and her beverage was dew gathered from\r\nthe cups of the flowers.\r\n\r\nSensible Frya! The first lesson that she taught her children was\r\nself-control, and the second was the love of virtue; and when they\r\nwere grown she taught them the value of liberty; for she said,\r\n\"Without liberty all other virtues serve to make you slaves, and to\r\ndisgrace your origin.\"\r\n\r\nGenerous Frya! She never allowed metal to be dug from the earth for\r\nher own benefit, but when she did it it was for the general use.\r\n\r\nMost happy Frya! Like the starry host in the firmament, her children\r\nclustered around her.\r\n\r\nWise Frya! When she had seen her children reach the seventh generation,\r\nshe summoned them all to Flyland, and there gave them her Tex, saying,\r\n\"Let this be your guide, and it can never go ill with you.\"\r\n\r\nExalted Frya! When she had thus spoken the earth shook like the sea\r\nof Wr-alda. The ground of Flyland sunk beneath her feet, the air\r\nwas dimmed by tears, and when they looked for their mother she was\r\nalready risen to her watching star; then at length thunder burst from\r\nthe clouds, and the lightning wrote upon the firmament \"Watch!\"\r\n\r\nFar-seeing Frya! The land from which she had risen was now a stream,\r\nand except her Tex all that was in it was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nObedient children! When they came to themselves again, they made\r\nthis high mound and built this citadel upon it, and on the walls\r\nthey wrote the Tex, and that every one should be able to find it they\r\ncalled the land about it Texland. Therefore it shall remain as long\r\nas the earth shall be the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRYA'S TEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nProsperity awaits the free. At last they shall see me again. Through\r\nhim only can I recognise as free who is neither a slave to another\r\nnor to himself. This is my counsel:--\r\n\r\n1. When in dire distress, and when mental and physical energy avail\r\nnothing, then have recourse to the spirit of Wr-alda; but do not\r\nappeal to him before you have tried all other means, for I tell you\r\nbeforehand, and time will prove its truth, that those who give way\r\nto discouragement sink under their burdens.\r\n\r\n2. To Wr-alda's spirit only shall you bend the knee in\r\ngratitude--thricefold--for what you have received, for what you do\r\nreceive, and for the hope of aid in time of need.\r\n\r\n3. You have seen how speedily I have come to your assistance. Do\r\nlikewise to your neighbour, but wait not for his entreaties. The\r\nsuffering would curse you, my maidens would erase your name from the\r\nbook, and I would regard you as a stranger.\r\n\r\n4. Let not your neighbour express his thanks to you on bended knee,\r\nwhich is only due to Wr-alda's spirit. Envy would assail you, Wisdom\r\nwould ridicule you, and my maidens would accuse you of irreverence.\r\n\r\n5. Four things are given for your enjoyment--air, water, land, and\r\nfire--but Wr-alda is the sole possessor of them. Therefore my counsel\r\nto you is, choose upright men who will fairly divide the labour and\r\nthe fruits, so that no man shall be exempt from work or from the duty\r\nof defence.\r\n\r\n6. If ever it should happen that one of your people should sell his\r\nfreedom, he is not of you, he is a bastard. I counsel you to expel him\r\nand his mother from the land. Repeat this to your children morning,\r\nnoon, and night, till they think of it in their dreams.\r\n\r\n7. If any man shall deprive another, even his debtor, of his liberty,\r\nlet him be to you as a vile slave; and I advise you to burn his body\r\nand that of his mother in an open place, and bury them fifty feet\r\nbelow the ground, so that no grass shall grow upon them. It would\r\npoison your cattle.\r\n\r\n8. Meddle not with the people of Lyda, nor of Finda, because Wr-alda\r\nwould help them, and any injury that you inflicted on them would\r\nrecoil upon your own heads.\r\n\r\n9. If it should happen that they come to you for advice or assistance,\r\nthen it behoves you to help them; but if they should rob you, then\r\nfall upon them with fire and sword.\r\n\r\n10. If any of them should seek a daughter of yours to wife, and she is\r\nwilling, explain to her her folly; but if she will follow her lover,\r\nlet her go in peace.\r\n\r\n11. If your son wishes for a daughter of theirs, do the same as to your\r\ndaughter; but let not either one or the other ever return among you,\r\nfor they would introduce foreign morals and customs, and if these\r\nwere accepted by you, I could no longer watch over you.\r\n\r\n12. Upon my servant Fasta I have placed all my hopes. Therefore\r\nyou must choose her for Eeremoeder. Follow my advice, then she will\r\nhereafter remain my servant as well as all the sacred maidens who\r\nsucceed her. Then shall the lamp which I have lighted for you never be\r\nextinguished. Its brightness shall always illuminate your intellect,\r\nand you shall always remain as free from foreign domination as your\r\nfresh river-water is distinct from the salt sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS HAS FASTA SPOKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the regulations which have existed a century, that is, a hundred\r\nyears, may by the advice of the Eeremoeder, with the consent of\r\nthe community, be inscribed upon the walls of the citadel, and when\r\ninscribed on the walls they become laws, and it is our duty to respect\r\nthem all. If by force or necessity any regulations should be imposed\r\nupon us at variance with our laws and customs, we must submit; but\r\nshould we be released, we must always return to our own again. That\r\nis Frya's will, and must be that of all her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFASTA SAID--\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything that any man commences, whatever it may be, on the day\r\nappointed for Frya's worship shall eternally fail, for time has\r\nproved that she was right; and it is become a law that no man shall,\r\nexcept from absolute necessity, keep that day otherwise than as a\r\njoyful feast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE ARE THE LAWS ESTABLISHED FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CITADELS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Whenever a citadel is built, the lamp belonging to it must be\r\nlighted at the original lamp in Texland, and that can only be done\r\nby the mother.\r\n\r\n2. Every mother shall appoint her own maidens. She may even choose\r\nthose who are mothers in other towns.\r\n\r\n3. The mother of Texland may appoint her own successor, but should\r\nshe die without having done so, the election shall take place at a\r\ngeneral assembly of the whole nation.\r\n\r\n4. The mother of Texland may have twenty-one maidens and seven\r\nassistants, so that there may always be seven to attend the lamp day\r\nand night. She may have the same number of maidens who are mothers\r\nin other towns.\r\n\r\n5. If a maiden wishes to marry, she must announce it to the mother,\r\nand immediately resign her office, before her passion shall have\r\npolluted the light.\r\n\r\n6. For the service of the mother and of each of the Burgtmaidens\r\nthere shall be appointed twenty-one townsmen--seven civilians of\r\nmature years, seven warriors of mature years, and seven seamen of\r\nmature years.\r\n\r\n7. Out of the seven three shall retire every year, and shall not be\r\nreplaced by members of their own family nearer than the fourth degree.\r\n\r\n8. Each may have three hundred young townsmen as defenders.\r\n\r\n9. For this service they must study Frya's Tex and the laws. From\r\nthe sages they must learn wisdom, from the warriors the art of war,\r\nand from the sea-kings the skill required for distant voyages.\r\n\r\n10. Every year one hundred of the defenders shall return to their\r\nhomes, and those that may have been wounded shall remain in the\r\ncitadels.\r\n\r\n11. At the election of the defenders no burgher or Grevetman, or\r\nother person of distinction, shall vote, but only the people.\r\n\r\n12. The mother at Texland shall have three times seven active\r\nmessengers, and three times twelve speedy horses. In the other citadels\r\neach maiden shall have three messengers and seven horses.\r\n\r\n13. Every citadel shall have fifty agriculturists chosen by the people,\r\nbut only those may be chosen who are not strong enough to go to war\r\nor to go to sea.\r\n\r\n14. Every citadel must provide for its own sustenance, and must\r\nmaintain its own defences, and look after its share of the general\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n15. If a man is chosen to fill any office and refuses to serve, he\r\ncan never become a burgher, nor have any vote. And if he is already\r\na burgher, he shall cease to be so.\r\n\r\n16. If any man wishes to consult the mother or a Burgtmaid, he must\r\napply to the secretary, who will take him to the Burgtmaster. He\r\nwill then be examined by a surgeon to see if he is in good health. If\r\nhe is passed, he shall lay aside his arms, and seven warriors shall\r\npresent him to the mother.\r\n\r\n17. If the affair concerns only one district, he must bring forward not\r\nless than three witnesses; but if it affects the whole of Friesland,\r\nhe must have twenty-one additional witnesses, in order to guard\r\nagainst any deceptions.\r\n\r\n18. Under all circumstances the mother must take care that her\r\nchildren, that is, Frya's people, shall remain as temperate as\r\npossible. This is her most important duty, and it is the duty of all\r\nof us to help her in performing it.\r\n\r\n19. If she is called upon to decide any judicial question between\r\na Grevetman and the community, she must incline towards the side of\r\nthe community in order to maintain peace, and because it is better\r\nthat one man should suffer than many.\r\n\r\n20. If any one comes to the mother for advice, and she is prepared\r\nto give it, she must do it immediately. If she does not know what to\r\nadvise, he must remain waiting seven days; and if she then is unable\r\nto advise, he must go away without complaining, for it is better to\r\nhave no advice at all than bad advice.\r\n\r\n21. If a mother shall have given bad advice out of ill will, she must\r\nbe killed or driven out of the land, deprived of everything.\r\n\r\n22. If her Burgtheeren are accomplices, they are to be treated in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\n23. If her guilt is doubtful or only suspected, it must be considered\r\nand debated, if necessary, for twenty-one weeks. If half the votes\r\nare against her, she must be declared innocent. If two-thirds are\r\nagainst her, she must wait a whole year. If the votes are then the\r\nsame, she must be considered guilty, but may not be put to death.\r\n\r\n24. If any of the one-third who have voted for her wish to go away\r\nwith her, they may depart with all their live and dead stock, and\r\nshall not be the less considered, since the majority may be wrong as\r\nwell as the minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. All free-born men are equal, wherefore they must all have equal\r\nrights on sea and land, and on all that Wr-alda has given.\r\n\r\n2. Every man may seek the wife of his choice, and every woman may\r\nbestow her hand on him whom she loves.\r\n\r\n3. When a man takes a wife, a house and yard must be given to him. If\r\nthere is none, one must be built for him.\r\n\r\n4. If he has taken a wife in another village, and wishes to remain,\r\nthey must give him a house there, and likewise the free use of\r\nthe common.\r\n\r\n5. To every man must be given a piece of land behind his house. No\r\nman shall have land in front of his house, still less an enclosure,\r\nunless he has performed some public service. In such a case it may be\r\ngiven, and the youngest son may inherit it, but after him it returns\r\nto the community.\r\n\r\n6. Every village shall possess a common for the general good, and the\r\nchief of the village shall take care that it is kept in good order,\r\nso that posterity shall find it uninjured.\r\n\r\n7. Every village shall have a market-place. All the rest of the land\r\nshall be for tillage and forest. No one shall fell trees without the\r\nconsent of the community, or without the knowledge of the forester;\r\nfor the forests are general property, and no man can appropriate them.\r\n\r\n8. The market charges shall not exceed one-twelfth of the value of\r\nthe goods either to natives or strangers. The portion taken for the\r\ncharges shall not be sold before the other goods.\r\n\r\n9. All the market receipts must be divided yearly into a hundred\r\nparts three days before the Juul-day.\r\n\r\n10. The Grevetman and his council shall take twenty parts; the keeper\r\nof the market ten, and his assistants five; the Volksmoeder one,\r\nthe midwife four, the village ten, and the poor and infirm shall have\r\nfifty parts.\r\n\r\n11. There shall be no usurers in the market.\r\n\r\nIf any should come, it will be the duty of the maidens to make it\r\nknown through the whole land, in order that such people may not be\r\nchosen for any office, because they are hard-hearted.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of money they would betray everybody--the people, the\r\nmother, their nearest relations, and even their own selves.\r\n\r\n12. If any man should attempt to sell diseased cattle or damaged\r\ngoods for sound, the market-keeper shall expel him, and the maidens\r\nshall proclaim him through the country.\r\n\r\nIn early times almost all the Finns lived together in their native\r\nland, which was called Aldland, and is now submerged. They were thus\r\nfar away, and we had no wars. When they were driven hitherwards, and\r\nappeared as robbers, then arose the necessity of defending ourselves,\r\nand we had armies, kings, and wars.\r\n\r\nFor all this there were established regulations, and out of the\r\nregulations came fixed laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE FOLLOW THE LAWS WHICH WERE THUS ESTABLISHED.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Every Frisian must resist the assailants with such weapons as he\r\ncan procure, invent, and use.\r\n\r\n2. When a boy is twelve years old he must devote one day in seven to\r\nlearning how to use his weapons.\r\n\r\n3. As soon as he is perfect in the use of them they are to be given\r\nto him, and he is to be admitted as a warrior.\r\n\r\n4. After serving as a warrior three years, he may become a citizen,\r\nand may have a vote in the election of the headman.\r\n\r\n5. When he has been seven years a voter he then may have a vote for\r\nthe chief or king, and may be himself elected.\r\n\r\n6. Every year he must be re-elected.\r\n\r\n7. Except the king, all other officials are re-eligible who act\r\naccording to Frya's laws.\r\n\r\n8. No king may be in office more than three years, in order that the\r\noffice may not be permanent.\r\n\r\n9. After an interval of seven years he may be elected again.\r\n\r\n10. If the king is killed by the enemy, his nearest relative may be\r\na candidate to succeed him.\r\n\r\n11. If he dies a natural death, or if his period of service has\r\nexpired, he shall not be succeeded by any blood relation nearer than\r\nthe fourth degree.\r\n\r\n12. Those who fight with arms are not men of counsel, therefore no\r\nking must bear arms. His wisdom must be his weapon, and the love of\r\nhis warriors his shield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE ARE THE RIGHTS OF THE MOTHERS AND THE KINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If war breaks out, the mother sends her messengers to the king,\r\nwho sends messengers to the Grevetmen to call the citizens to arms.\r\n\r\n2. The Grevetmen call all the citizens together and decide how many\r\nmen shall be sent.\r\n\r\n3. All the resolutions must immediately be sent to the mother by\r\nmessengers and witnesses.\r\n\r\n4. The mother considers all the resolutions and decides upon them,\r\nand with this the king as well as the people must be satisfied.\r\n\r\n5. When in the field, the king consults only his superior officers, but\r\nthree citizens of the mother must be present, without any voice. These\r\ncitizens must send daily reports to the mother, that they may be sure\r\nnothing is done contrary to the counsels of Frya.\r\n\r\n6. If the king wishes to do anything which his council opposes,\r\nhe may not persist in it.\r\n\r\n7. If an enemy appears unexpectedly, then the king's orders must\r\nbe obeyed.\r\n\r\n8. If the king is not present, the next to him takes command, and so\r\non in succession according to rank.\r\n\r\n9. If there is no leader present, one must be chosen.\r\n\r\n10. If there is no time to choose, any one may come forward who feels\r\nhimself capable of leading.\r\n\r\n11. If a king has conquered a dangerous enemy, his successors may take\r\nhis name after their own. The king may, if he wishes, choose an open\r\npiece of ground for a house and ground; the ground shall be enclosed,\r\nand may be so large that there shall be seven hundred steps to the\r\nboundary in all directions from the house.\r\n\r\n12. His youngest son may inherit this, and that son's youngest son\r\nafter him; then it shall return to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ARE THE RULES ESTABLISHED FOR THE SECURITY OF ALL FRISIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Whenever new laws are made or new regulations established, they\r\nmust be for the common good, and not for individual advantage.\r\n\r\n2. Whenever in time of war either ships or houses are destroyed,\r\neither by the enemy or as a matter of precaution, a general levy\r\nshall be assessed on the people to make it good again, so that no\r\none may neglect the general welfare to preserve his own interest.\r\n\r\n3. At the conclusion of a war, if any men are so severely wounded as\r\nto be unable to work, they shall be maintained at the public expense,\r\nand shall have the best seats at festivals, in order that the young\r\nmay learn to honour them.\r\n\r\n4. If there are widows and orphans, they shall likewise be maintained\r\nat the public expense; and the sons may inscribe the names of their\r\nfathers on their shields for the honour of their families.\r\n\r\n5. If any who have been taken prisoners should return, they must be\r\nkept separate from the camp, because they may have obtained their\r\nliberty by making treacherous promises, and thus they may avoid\r\nkeeping their promises without forfeiting their honour.\r\n\r\n6. If any enemies be taken prisoners, they must be sent to the interior\r\nof the country, that they may learn our free customs.\r\n\r\n7. If they are afterwards set free, it must be done with kindness\r\nby the maidens, in order that we may make them comrades and friends,\r\ninstead of haters and enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MINNO'S WRITINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one should be so wicked as to commit robbery, murder, arson,\r\nrape, or any other crime, upon a neighbouring state, and our people\r\nwish to inflict punishment, the culprit shall be put to death in\r\nthe presence of the offended, in order that no war may arise, and\r\nthe innocent suffer for the guilty. If the offended will spare his\r\nlife and forego their revenge, it may be permitted. If the culprit\r\nshould be a king, Grevetman, or other person in authority, we must\r\nmake good his fault, but he must be punished.\r\n\r\nIf he bears on his shield the honourable name of his forefathers,\r\nhis kinsmen shall no longer wear it, in order that every man may look\r\nafter the conduct of his relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS FOR THE NAVIGATORS.\r\n\r\nNavigator is the title of those who make foreign voyages.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. All Frya's sons have equal rights, and every stalwart youth may\r\noffer himself as a navigator to the Olderman, who may not refuse him\r\nas long as there is any vacancy.\r\n\r\n2. The navigators may choose their own masters.\r\n\r\n3. The traders must be chosen and named by the community to which\r\nthey belong, and the navigators have no voice in their election.\r\n\r\n4. If during a voyage it is found that the king is bad or incompetent,\r\nanother may be put in his place, and on the return home he may make\r\nhis complaint to the Olderman.\r\n\r\n5. If the fleet returns with profits, the sailors may divide one-third\r\namong themselves in the following manner: The king twelve portions,\r\nthe admiral seven, the boatswains each two portions, the captains\r\nthree, and the rest of the crew each one part; the youngest boys\r\neach one-third of a portion, the second boys half a portion each,\r\nand the eldest boys two-thirds of a portion each.\r\n\r\n6. If any have been disabled, they must be maintained at the public\r\nexpense, and honoured in the same way as the soldiers.\r\n\r\n7. If any have died on the voyage, their nearest relatives inherit\r\ntheir portion.\r\n\r\n8. Their widows and orphans must be maintained at the public expense;\r\nand if they were killed in a sea-fight, their sons may bear the names\r\nof their fathers on their shields.\r\n\r\n9. If a topsailman is lost, his heirs shall receive a whole portion.\r\n\r\n10. If he was betrothed, his bride may claim seven portions in order\r\nto erect a monument to her bridegroom, but then she must remain a\r\nwidow all her life.\r\n\r\n11. If the community is fitting out a fleet, the purveyors must provide\r\nthe best provisions for the voyage, and for the women and children.\r\n\r\n12. If a sailor is worn out and poor, and has no house or patrimony,\r\none must be given him. If he does not wish for a house, his friends\r\nmay take him home; and the community must bear the expense, unless\r\nhis friends decline to receive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS LEFT BY MINNO.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinno was an ancient sea-king. He was a seer and a philosopher, and\r\nhe gave laws to the Cretans. He was born at Lindaoord, and after all\r\nhis wanderings he had the happiness to die at Lindahem.\r\n\r\nIf our neighbours have a piece of land or water which it would be\r\nadvantageous for us to possess, it is proper that we should offer to\r\nbuy it. If they refuse to sell it, we must let them keep it. This is\r\nFrya's Tex, and it would be unjust to act contrary to it.\r\n\r\nIf any of our neighbours quarrel and fight about any matter except\r\nland, and they request us to arbitrate, our best course will be\r\nto decline; but if they insist upon it, it must be done honourably\r\nand justly.\r\n\r\nIf any one comes and says, I am at war, you must help me; or another\r\ncomes and says, My son is an infant and incompetent, and I am old,\r\nso I wish you to be his guardian, and to take charge of my property\r\nuntil he is of age, it is proper to refuse in order that we may not\r\ncome into disputes about matters foreign to our free customs.\r\n\r\nWhenever a foreign trader comes to the open markets at Wyringen and\r\nAlmanland, if he cheats, he must immediately be fined, and it must\r\nbe published by the maidens throughout the whole country.\r\n\r\nIf he should come back, no one must deal with him. He must return as\r\nhe came.\r\n\r\nWhenever traders are chosen to go to trading stations, or to sail\r\nwith the fleets, they must be well known and of good reputation with\r\nthe maidens.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a bad man should by chance be chosen and should try to\r\ncheat, the others are bound to remove him. If he should have committed\r\na cheat, it must be made good, and the culprit must be banished from\r\nthe land in order that our name may be everywhere held in honour.\r\n\r\nIf we should be ill-treated in a foreign market, whether distant or\r\nnear, we must immediately attack them; for though we desire to be at\r\npeace, we must not let our neighbours underrate us or think that we\r\nare afraid.\r\n\r\nIn my youth I often grumbled at the strictness of the laws, but\r\nafterwards I learned to thank Frya for her Tex and our forefathers\r\nfor the laws which they established upon it. Wr-alda or Alvader has\r\ngiven me many years, and I have travelled over many lands and seas,\r\nand after all that I have seen, I am convinced that we alone are\r\nchosen by Alvader to have laws. Lyda's people can neither make laws\r\nnor obey them, they are too stupid and uncivilised. Many are like\r\nFinda. They are clever enough, but they are too rapacious, haughty,\r\nfalse, immoral, and bloodthirsty.\r\n\r\nThe toad blows himself out, but he can only crawl. The frog cries\r\n\"Work, work;\" but he can do nothing but hop and make himself\r\nridiculous. The raven cries \"Spare, spare;\" but he steals and wastes\r\neverything that he gets into his beak.\r\n\r\nFinda's people are just like these. They say a great deal about\r\nmaking good laws, and every one wishes to make regulations against\r\nmisconduct, but does not wish to submit to them himself. Whoever is\r\nthe most crafty crows over the others, and tries to make them submit\r\nto him, till another comes who drives him off his perch.\r\n\r\nThe word \"Eva\" is too sacred for common use, therefore men have\r\nlearned to say \"Evin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eva\" means that sentiment which is implanted in the breast of every\r\nman in order that he may know what is right and what is wrong, and by\r\nwhich he is able to judge his own deeds and those of others; that is,\r\nif he has been well and properly brought up. \"Eva\" has also another\r\nmeaning; that is, tranquil, smooth, like water that is not stirred by a\r\nbreath of wind. If the water is disturbed it becomes troubled, uneven,\r\nbut it always has a tendency to return to its tranquil condition. That\r\nis its nature, just as the inclination towards justice and freedom\r\nexists in Frya's children. We derive this disposition from the spirit\r\nof our father Wr-alda, which speaks strongly in Frya's children,\r\nand will eternally remain so. Eternity is another symbol of Wr-alda,\r\nwho remains always just and unchangeable.\r\n\r\nEternal and unalterable are the signs wisdom and rectitude, which\r\nmust be sought after by all pious people, and must be possessed by\r\nall judges. If, therefore, it is desired to make laws and regulations\r\nwhich shall be permanent, they must be equal for all men. The judges\r\nmust pronounce their decisions according to these laws. If any crime\r\nis committed respecting which no law has been made, a general assembly\r\nof the people shall be called, where judgment shall be pronounced in\r\naccordance with the inspiration of Wr-alda's spirit. If we act thus,\r\nour judgment will never fail to be right.\r\n\r\nIf instead of doing right, men will commit wrong, there will arise\r\nquarrels and differences among people and states. Thence arise civil\r\nwars, and everything is thrown into confusion and destroyed; and,\r\nO foolish people! while you are injuring each other the spiteful\r\nFinda's people with their false priests come and attack your ports,\r\nravish your daughters, corrupt your morals, and at last throw the\r\nbonds of slavery over every freeman's neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MINNO'S WRITINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Nyhalennia, whose real name was Min-erva, was well established,\r\nand the Krekalanders loved her as well as our own people did, there\r\ncame some princes and priests to her citadel and asked Min-erva, where\r\nher possessions lay. Hellenia answered, I carry my possessions in\r\nmy own bosom. What I have inherited is the love of wisdom, justice,\r\nand freedom. If I lose these I shall become as the least of your\r\nslaves; now I give advice for nothing, but then I should sell it. The\r\ngentlemen went away laughing and saying, Your humble servants, wise\r\nHellenia. But they missed their object, for the people took up this\r\nname as a name of honour. When they saw that their shot had missed they\r\nbegan to calumniate her, and to say that she had bewitched the people;\r\nbut our people and the good Krekalanders understood at once that it\r\nwas calumny. She was once asked, If you are not a witch, what is the\r\nuse of the eggs that you always carry with you? Min-erva answered,\r\nThese eggs are the symbols of Frya's counsels, in which our future\r\nand that of the whole human race lies concealed. Time will hatch them,\r\nand we must watch that no harm happens to them. The priests said, Well\r\nanswered; but what is the use of the dog on your right hand? Hellenia\r\nreplied, Does not the shepherd have a sheep-dog to keep his flock\r\ntogether? What the dog is to the shepherd I am in Frya's service. I\r\nmust watch over Frya's flocks. We understand that very well, said the\r\npriests; but tell us what means the owl that always sits upon your\r\nhead, is that light-shunning animal a sign of your clear vision? No,\r\nanswered Hellenia; he reminds me that there are people on earth who,\r\nlike him, have their homes in churches and holes, who go about in the\r\ntwilight, not, like him, to deliver us from mice and other plagues,\r\nbut to invent tricks to steal away the knowledge of other people, in\r\norder to take advantage of them, to make slaves of them, and to suck\r\ntheir blood like leeches. Another time they came with a whole troop\r\nof people, when the plague was in the country, and said: We are all\r\nmaking offerings to the gods that they may take away the plague. Will\r\nyou not help to turn away their anger, or have you yourself brought the\r\nplague into the land with all your arts? No, said Min-erva; I know no\r\ngods that do evil, therefore I cannot ask them to do better. I only\r\nknow one good spirit, that is Wr-alda's; and as he is good he never\r\ndoes evil. Where, then, does evil come from? asked the priests. All\r\nthe evil comes from you, and from the stupidity of the people who let\r\nthemselves be deceived by you. If, then, your god is so exceedingly\r\ngood, why does he not turn away the bad? asked the priests. Hellenia\r\nanswered: Frya has placed us here, and the carrier, that is, Time,\r\nmust do the rest. For all calamities there is counsel and remedy to\r\nbe found, but Wr-alda wills that we should search it out ourselves,\r\nin order that we may become strong and wise. If we will not do that,\r\nhe leaves us to our own devices, in order that we may experience the\r\nresults of wise or foolish conduct. Then a prince said, I should think\r\nit best to submit. Very possibly, answered Hellenia; for then men\r\nwould be like sheep, and you and the priests would take care of them,\r\nshearing them and leading them to the shambles. This is what our god\r\ndoes not desire, he desires that we should help one another, but that\r\nall should be free and wise. That is also our desire, and therefore our\r\npeople choose their princes, counts, councillors, chiefs, and masters\r\namong the wisest of the good men, in order that every man shall do\r\nhis best to be wise and good. Thus doing, we learn ourselves and\r\nteach the people that being wise and acting wisely can alone lead to\r\nholiness. That seems very good judgment, said the priests; but if you\r\nmean that the plague is caused by our stupidity, then Nyhellenia will\r\nperhaps be so good as to bestow upon us a little of that new light of\r\nwhich she is so proud. Yes, said Hellenia, but ravens and other birds\r\nof prey feed only on dead carrion, whereas the plague feeds not only\r\non carrion but on bad laws and customs and wicked passions. If you\r\nwish the plague to depart from you and not return, you must put away\r\nyour bad passions and become pure within and without. We admit that\r\nthe advice is good, said the priests, but how shall we induce all the\r\npeople under our rule to agree to it? Then Hellenia stood up and said:\r\nThe sparrows follow the sower, and the people their good princes,\r\ntherefore it becomes you to begin by rendering yourselves pure, so\r\nthat you may look within and without, and not be ashamed of your own\r\nconduct. Now, instead of purifying the people, you have invented foul\r\nfestivals, in which they have so long revelled that they wallow like\r\nswine in the mire to atone for your evil passions. The people began\r\nto mock and to jeer, so that she did not dare to pursue the subject;\r\nand one would have thought that they would have called all the people\r\ntogether to drive us out of the land; but no, in place of abusing\r\nher they went all about from the heathenish Krekaland to the Alps,\r\nproclaiming that it had pleased the Almighty God to send his clever\r\ndaughter Min-erva, surnamed Nyhellenia, over the sea in a cloud to\r\ngive people good counsel, and that all who listened to her should\r\nbecome rich and happy, and in the end governors of all the kingdoms\r\nof the earth. They erected statues to her on all their altars,\r\nthey announced and sold to the simple people advice that she had\r\nnever given, and related miracles that she had never performed. They\r\ncunningly made themselves masters of our laws and customs, and by\r\ncraft and subtlety were able to explain and spread them around. They\r\nappointed priestesses under their own care, who were apparently\r\nunder the protection of Festa, our first Eeremoeder, to watch over\r\nthe holy lamp; but that lamp they lit themselves, and instead of\r\nimbuing the priestesses with wisdom, and then sending them to watch\r\nthe sick and educate the young, they made them stupid and ignorant,\r\nand never allowed them to come out. They were employed as advisers,\r\nbut the advice which seemed to come from them was but the repetition of\r\nthe behests of the priests. When Nyhellenia died, we wished to choose\r\nanother mother, and some of us wished to go to Texland to look for\r\nher; but the priests, who were all-powerful among their own people,\r\nwould not permit it, and accused us before the people of being unholy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE WRITINGS OF MINNO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I came away from Athenia with my followers, we arrived at\r\nan island named by my crew Kreta, because of the cries that the\r\ninhabitants raised on our arrival. When they really saw that we did\r\nnot come to make war, they were quiet, so that at last I was able to\r\nbuy a harbour in exchange for a boat and some iron implements, and a\r\npiece of land. When we had been settled there a short time, and they\r\ndiscovered that we had no slaves, they were very much astonished;\r\nand when I explained to them that we had laws which made everybody\r\nequal, they wished to have the same; but they had hardly established\r\nthem before the whole land was in confusion.\r\n\r\nThe priests and the princes declared that we had excited their\r\nsubjects to rebellion, and the people appealed to us for aid and\r\nprotection. When the princes saw that they were about to lose their\r\nkingdom, they gave freedom to their people, and came to me to establish\r\na code of laws. The people, however, got no freedom, and the princes\r\nremained masters, acting according to their own pleasure. When this\r\nstorm had passed, they began to sow divisions among us. They told my\r\npeople that I had invoked their assistance to make myself permanent\r\nking. Once I found poison in my food. So when a ship from Flyland\r\nsailed past, I quietly took my departure. Leaving alone, then, my own\r\nadventures, I will conclude this history by saying that we must not\r\nhave anything to do with Finda's people, wherever it may be, because\r\nthey are full of false tricks, fully as much to be feared as their\r\nsweet wine with deadly poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HERE ENDS MINNO'S WRITING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE ARE THE THREE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THESE LAWS ARE FOUNDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Everybody knows that he requires the necessaries of life, and if\r\nhe cannot obtain them he does not know how to preserve his life.\r\n\r\n2. All men have a natural desire to have children, and if it is not\r\nsatisfied they are not aware what evil may spring from it.\r\n\r\n3. Every man knows that he wishes to live free and undisturbed,\r\nand that others wish the same thing.\r\n\r\nTo secure this, these laws and regulations are made.\r\n\r\nThe people of Finda have also their rules and regulations, but these\r\nare not made according to what is just--only for the advantage of\r\npriests and princes--therefore their states are full of disputes\r\nand murder.\r\n\r\n1. If any man falls into a state of destitution, his case must be\r\nbrought before the count by the maidens, because a high-minded Frisian\r\ncannot bear to do that himself.\r\n\r\n2. If any man becomes poor because he will not work, he must be sent\r\nout of the country, because the cowardly and lazy are troublesome\r\nand ill-disposed, therefore they ought to be got rid of.\r\n\r\n3. Every young man ought to seek a bride and to be married at\r\nfive-and-twenty.\r\n\r\n4. If a young man is not married at five-and-twenty, he must be\r\ndriven from his home, and the younger men must avoid him. If then\r\nhe will not marry, he must be declared dead, and leave the country,\r\nso that he may not give offence.\r\n\r\n5. If a man is impotent, he must openly declare that no one has\r\nanything to fear from him, then he may come or go where he likes.\r\n\r\n6. If after that he commits any act of incontinence, then he must\r\nflee away; if he does not, he may be given over to the vengeance of\r\nthose whom he has offended, and no one may aid him.\r\n\r\n7. Any one who commits a theft shall restore it threefold. For a\r\nsecond offence he shall be sent to the tin mines. The person robbed\r\nmay forgive him if he pleases, but for a third offence no one shall\r\nprotect him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE RULES ARE MADE FOR ANGRY PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If a man in a passion or out of ill will breaks another's limb\r\nor puts out an eye or a tooth, he must pay whatever the injured\r\nman demands. If he cannot pay, he must suffer the same injury as\r\nhe has done to the other. If he refuses this, he must appeal to the\r\nBurgtmaagd in order to be sent to work in the iron or tin mines until\r\nhe has expiated his crime under the general law.\r\n\r\n2. If a man is so wicked as to kill a Frisian, he must forfeit his\r\nown life; but if the Burgtmaagd can send him to the tin mines for\r\nhis life before he is taken, she may do so.\r\n\r\n3. If the prisoner can prove by proper witnesses that the death was\r\naccidental, he may go free; but if it happens a second time, he must go\r\nto the tin mines, in order to avoid any unseemly hatred or vengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE ARE THE RULES CONCERNING BASTARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If any man sets fire to another's house, he is no Frisian, he is\r\na bastard. If he is caught in the act, he must be thrown into the\r\nfire; and wherever he may flee, he shall never be secure from the\r\navenging justice.\r\n\r\n2. No true Frisian shall speak ill of the faults of his neighbours. If\r\nany man injures himself, but does no harm to others, he must be his\r\nown judge; but if he becomes so bad that he is dangerous to others,\r\nthey must bring it before the count. But if instead of going to the\r\ncount a man accuses another behind his back, he must be put on the\r\npillory in the market-place, and then sent out of the country, but\r\nnot to the tin mines, because even there a backbiter is to be feared.\r\n\r\n3. If any man should prove a traitor and show to our enemies the paths\r\nleading to our places of refuge, or creep into them by night, he must\r\nbe the offspring of Finda; he must be burnt. The sailors must take his\r\nmother and all his relations to a desolate island, and there scatter\r\nhis ashes, in order that no poisonous herbs may spring from them. The\r\nmaidens must curse his name in all the states, in order that no child\r\nmay be called by his name, and that his ancestors may repudiate him.\r\n\r\nWar had come to an end, but famine came in its place. There were\r\nthree men who each stole a sack of corn from different owners, but\r\nthey were all caught. The first owner brought his thief to the judge,\r\nand the maidens said everywhere that he had done right. The second\r\nowner took the corn away from his thief and let him go in peace. The\r\nmaidens said he has done well. The third owner went to the thief's\r\nhouse, and when he saw what misery was there, he went and brought a\r\nwaggon-load of necessaries to relieve their distress. Frya's maidens\r\ncame around him and wrote his deed in the eternal book, and wiped\r\nout all his sins. This was reported to the Eeremoeder, and she had\r\nit made known over the whole country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS WRITTEN HEREUNDER IS INSCRIBED ON THE WALLS OF WARABURGT.\r\n\r\n(See Plate I.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat appears at the top is the signs of the Juul--that is, the first\r\nsymbol of Wr-alda, also of the origin or beginning from which Time\r\nis derived; this is the Kroder, which must always go round with the\r\nJuul. According to this model Frya formed the set hand which she\r\nused to write her Tex. When Fasta was Eeremoeder she made a running\r\nhand out of it. The Witkoning--that is, the Sea-King Godfried the\r\nOld--made separate numbers for the set hand and for the runic hand. It\r\nis therefore not too much that we celebrate it once a year. We may be\r\neternally thankful to Wr-alda that he allowed his spirit to exercise\r\nsuch an influence over our forefathers.\r\n\r\nIn her time Finda also invented a mode of writing, but that was so\r\nhigh-flown and full of flourishes that her descendants have soon lost\r\nthe meaning of it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards they learned our writing--that is, the Finns, the Thyriers,\r\nand the Krekalanders--but they did not know that it was taken\r\nfrom the Juul, and most therefore always be written round like the\r\nsun. Furthermore, they wished that their writing should be illegible\r\nby other people, because they always had matters to conceal. In\r\ndoing this they acted very unwisely, because their children could\r\nonly with great difficulty read the writings of their predecessors,\r\nwhereas our most ancient writings are as easy to read as those that\r\nwere written yesterday.\r\n\r\nHere is a specimen of the set hand and of the running hand, as well\r\nas of the figures, in both.\r\n\r\n(See Plate II.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS STANDS INSCRIBED UPON ALL CITADELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the bad time came our country was the most beautiful in the\r\nworld. The sun rose higher, and there was seldom frost. The trees and\r\nshrubs produced various fruits, which are now lost. In the fields we\r\nhad not only barley, oats, and rye, but wheat which shone like gold,\r\nand which could be baked in the sun's rays. The years were not counted,\r\nfor one was as happy as another.\r\n\r\nOn one side we were bounded by Wr-alda's Sea, on which no one but us\r\nmight or could sail; on the other side we were hedged in by the broad\r\nTwiskland (Tusschenland, Duitschland), through which the Finda people\r\ndared not come on account of the thick forests and the wild beasts.\r\n\r\nEastward our boundary went to the extremity of the East Sea, and\r\nwestward to the Mediterranean Sea; so that besides the small rivers\r\nwe had twelve large rivers given us by Wr-alda to keep our land moist,\r\nand to show our seafaring men the way to his sea.\r\n\r\nThe banks of these rivers were at one time entirely inhabited\r\nby our people, as well as the banks of the Rhine from one end\r\nto the other. Opposite Denmark and Jutland we had colonies and a\r\nBurgtmaagd. Thence we obtained copper and iron, as well as tar and\r\npitch, and some other necessaries. Opposite to us we had Britain,\r\nformerly Westland, with her tin mines.\r\n\r\nBritain was the land of the exiles, who with the help of their\r\nBurgtmaagd had gone away to save their lives; but in order that they\r\nmight not come back they were tattooed with a B on the forehead, the\r\nbanished with a red dye, the other criminals with blue. Moreover, our\r\nsailors and merchants had many factories among the distant Krekalanders\r\nand in Lydia. In Lydia (Lybia) the people are black. As our country\r\nwas so great and extensive, we had many different names. Those who\r\nwere settled to the east of Denmark were called Jutten, because often\r\nthey did nothing else than look for amber (jutten) on the shore. Those\r\nwho lived in the islands were called Letten, because they lived an\r\nisolated life. All those who lived between Denmark and the Sandval,\r\nnow the Scheldt, were called Stuurlieden (pilots), Zeekampers (naval\r\nmen), and Angelaren (fishermen). The Angelaren were men who fished in\r\nthe sea, and were so named because they used lines and hooks instead of\r\nnets. From there to the nearest part of Krekaland the inhabitants were\r\ncalled Kadhemers, because they never went to sea but remained ashore.\r\n\r\nThose who were settled in the higher marches bounded by Twisklanden\r\n(Germany) were called Saxmannen, because they were always armed\r\nagainst the wild beasts and the savage Britons. Besides these we had\r\nthe names Landzaten (natives of the land), Marzaten (natives of the\r\nfens), and Woud or Hout zaten (natives of the woods).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE BAD TIME CAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole summer the sun had been hid behind the clouds,\r\nas if unwilling to look upon the earth. There was perpetual calm,\r\nand the damp mist hung like a wet sail over the houses and the\r\nmarshes. The air was heavy and oppressive, and in men's hearts was\r\nneither joy nor cheerfulness. In the midst of this stillness the\r\nearth began to tremble as if she was dying. The mountains opened to\r\nvomit forth fire and flames. Some sank into the bosom of the earth,\r\nand in other places mountains rose out of the plain. Aldland, called\r\nby the seafaring people, Atland, disappeared, and the wild waves\r\nrose so high over hill and dale that everything was buried in the\r\nsea. Many people were swallowed up by the earth, and others who had\r\nescaped the fire perished in the water.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in Finda's land that the earth vomited fire, but also\r\nin Twiskland (Germany). Whole forests were burned one after the other,\r\nand when the wind blew from that quarter our land was covered with\r\nashes. Rivers changed their course, and at their mouths new islands\r\nwere formed of sand and drift.\r\n\r\nDuring three years this continued, but at length it ceased, and\r\nforests became visible. Many countries were submerged, and in other\r\nplaces land rose above the sea, and the wood was destroyed through\r\nthe half of Twiskland (Germany). Troops of Finda's people came and\r\nsettled in the empty places. Our dispersed people were exterminated\r\nor made slaves. Then watchfulness was doubly impressed upon us,\r\nand time taught us that union is force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS INSCRIBED ON THE WARABURGT BY THE ALDEGAMUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Waraburgt is not a maiden's city, but the place where all the\r\nforeign articles brought by sailors were stored. It lies three hours\r\nsouth from Medeasblik.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUS IS THE PREFACE.\r\n\r\nHills, bow your heads; weep, ye streams and clouds. Yes. Schoonland\r\n(Scandinavia) blushes, an enslaved people tramples on your garment,\r\nO Frya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE HISTORY.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and one years after the submersion of Aldland a people\r\ncame out of the East. That people was driven by another. Behind us,\r\nin Twiskland (Germany), they fell into disputes, divided into two\r\nparties, and each went its own way. Of the one no account has come to\r\nus, but the other came in the back of our Schoonland, which was thinly\r\ninhabited, particularly the upper part. Therefore they were able to\r\ntake possession of it without contest, and as they did no other harm,\r\nwe would not make war about it. Now that we have learned to know them,\r\nwe will describe their customs, and after that how matters went between\r\nus. They were not wild people, like most of Finda's race; but, like the\r\nEgyptians, they have priests and also statues in their churches. The\r\npriests are the only rulers; they call themselves Magyars, and their\r\nheadman Magy. He is high priest and king in one. The rest of the people\r\nare of no account, and in subjection to them. This people have not even\r\na name; but we call them Finns, because although all the festivals are\r\nmelancholy and bloody, they are so formal that we are inferior to them\r\nin that respect. But still they are not to be envied, because they are\r\nslaves to their priests, and still more to their creeds. They believe\r\nthat evil spirits abound everywhere, and enter into men and beasts,\r\nbut of Wr-alda's spirit they know nothing. They have weapons of stone,\r\nthe Magyars of copper. The Magyars affirm that they can exorcise\r\nand recall the evil spirits, and this frightens the people, so that\r\nyou never see a cheerful face. When they were well established, the\r\nMagyars sought our friendship, they praised our language and customs,\r\nour cattle and iron weapons, which they would willingly have exchanged\r\nfor their gold and silver ornaments, and they always kept their people\r\nwithin their own boundaries, and that outwitted our watchfulness.\r\n\r\nEighty years afterwards, just at the time of the Juulfeest, they\r\noverran our country like a snowstorm driven by the wind. All who\r\ncould not flee away were killed. Frya was appealed to, but the\r\nSchoonlanders (Scandinavians) had neglected her advice. Then all\r\nthe forces were assembled, and three hours from Godasburgt they\r\nwere withstood, but war continued. Kat or Katerine was the name of\r\nthe priestess who was Burgtmaagd of Godasburgt. Kat was proud and\r\nhaughty, and would neither seek counsel nor aid from the mother;\r\nbut when the Burgtheeren (citizens) knew this, they themselves\r\nsent messengers to Texland to the Eeremoeder. Minna--this was the\r\nname of the mother--summoned all the sailors and the young men from\r\nOostflyland and Denmark. From this expedition the history of Wodin\r\nsprang, which is inscribed on the citadels, and is here copied. At\r\nAldergamude there lived an old sea-king whose name was Sterik, and\r\nwhose deeds were famous. This old fellow had three nephews. Wodin,\r\nthe eldest, lived at Lumkamakia, near the Eemude, in Oostflyland,\r\nwith his parents. He had once commanded troops. Teunis and Inka were\r\nnaval warriors, and were just then staying with their father at\r\nAldergamude. When the young warriors had assembled together, they\r\nchose Wodin to be their leader or king, and the naval force chose\r\nTeunis for their sea-king and Inka for their admiral. The navy then\r\nsailed to Denmark, where they took on board Wodin and his valiant host.\r\n\r\nThe wind was fair, so they arrived immediately in Schoonland. When the\r\nnorthern brothers met together, Wodin divided his powerful army into\r\nthree bodies. Frya was their war-cry, and they drove back the Finns\r\nand Magyars like children. When the Magy heard how his forces had\r\nbeen utterly defeated, he sent messengers with truncheon and crown,\r\nwho said to Wodin: O almighty king, we are guilty, but all that we\r\nhave done was done from necessity. You think that we attacked your\r\nbrothers out of ill will, but we were driven out by our enemies, who\r\nare still at our heels. We have often asked your Burgtmaagd for help,\r\nbut she took no notice of us. The Magy says that if we kill half our\r\nnumbers in fighting with each other, then the wild shepherds will come\r\nand kill all the rest. The Magy possesses great riches, but he has\r\nseen that Frya is much more powerful than all our spirits together. He\r\nwill lay down his head in her lap. You are the most warlike king on\r\nthe earth, and your people are of iron. Become our king, and we will\r\nall be your slaves. What glory it would be for you if you could drive\r\nback the savages! Our trumpets would resound with your praises, and\r\nthe fame of your deeds would precede you everywhere. Wodin was strong,\r\nfierce, and warlike, but he was not clear-sighted, therefore he was\r\ntaken in their toils, and crowned by the Magy.\r\n\r\nVery many of the sailors and soldiers to whom this proceeding was\r\ndispleasing went away secretly, taking Kat with them. But Kat, who did\r\nnot wish to appear before either the mother or the general assembly,\r\njumped overboard. Then a storm arose and drove the ships upon the\r\nbanks of Denmark, with the total destruction of their crews. This\r\nstrait was afterwards called the Kattegat. When Wodin was crowned,\r\nhe attacked the savages, who were all horsemen, and fell upon Wodin's\r\ntroops like a hailstorm; but like a whirl-wind they were turned back,\r\nand did not dare to appear again. When Wodin returned, Magy gave him\r\nhis daughter to wife. Whereupon he was incensed with herbs; but they\r\nwere magic herbs, and by degrees he became so audacious that he dared\r\nto disavow and ridicule the spirits of Frya and Wr-alda, while he\r\nbent his free head before the false and deceitful images. His reign\r\nlasted seven years, and then he disappeared. The Magy said that he\r\nwas taken up by their gods and still reigned over us, but our people\r\nlaughed at what they said. When Wodin had disappeared some time,\r\ndisputes arose. We wished to choose another king, but the Magy would\r\nnot permit it. He asserted that it was his right given him by his\r\nidols. But besides this dispute there was one between the Magyars and\r\nFinns, who would honour neither Frya nor Wodin; but the Magy did just\r\nas he pleased, because his daughter had a son by Wodin, and he would\r\nhave it that this son was of high descent. While all were disputing and\r\nquarrelling, he crowned the boy as king, and set up himself as guardian\r\nand counsellor. Those who cared more for themselves than for justice\r\nlet him work his own way, but the good men took their departure. Many\r\nMagyars fled back with their troops, and the sea-people took ship,\r\naccompanied by a body of stalwart Finns as rowers.\r\n\r\nNext comes upon the stage the history of Neef Teunis and Neef Inka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALL THIS IS INSCRIBED NOT ONLY ON THE WARABURGT, BUT ALSO ON THE\r\nBURGT STAVIA, WHICH LIES BEHIND THE PORT OF STAVRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Teunis wished to return home, he went first towards Denmark;\r\nbut he might not land there, for so the mother had ordered, nor\r\nwas he to land at Flyland nor anywhere about there. In this way he\r\nwould have lost all his people by want and hardship, so he landed\r\nat night to steal and sailed on by day. Thus coasting along, he at\r\nlength arrived at the colony of Kadik (Cadiz), so called because it\r\nwas built with a stone quay. Here they bought all kinds of stores,\r\nbut Tuntia the Burgtmaagd would not allow them to settle there. When\r\nthey were ready they began to disagree. Teunis wished to sail through\r\nthe straits to the Mediterranean Sea, and enter the service of the\r\nrich Egyptian king, as he had done before, but Inka said he had had\r\nenough of all those Finda's people. Inka thought that perchance some\r\nhigh-lying part of Atland might remain as an island, where he and\r\nhis people might live in peace. As the two cousins could not agree,\r\nTeunis planted a red flag on the shore, and Inka a blue flag. Every\r\nman could choose which he pleased, and to their astonishment the\r\ngreater part of the Finns and Magyars followed Inka, who had objected\r\nto serve the kings of Finda's people. When they had counted the people\r\nand divided the ships accordingly, the fleet separated. We shall hear\r\nof Teunis afterwards, but nothing more of Inka.\r\n\r\nNeef Teunis coasted through the straits to the Mediterranean\r\nSea. When Atland was submerged there was much suffering also on\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean, on which account many of Finda's\r\npeople, Krekalanders, and people from Lyda's land, came to us. On\r\nthe other hand, many of our people went to Lyda's land. The result\r\nof all this was that the Krekalanders far and wide were lost to the\r\nsuperintendence of the mother. Teunis had reckoned on this, and had\r\ntherefore wished to find there a good haven from which he might go\r\nand serve under the rich princes; but as his fleet and his people had\r\nsuch a shattered appearance, the inhabitants on the coasts thought\r\nthat they were pirates, and drove them away. At last they arrived\r\nat the Phoenician coast, one hundred and ninety-three years after\r\nAtland was submerged. Near the coast they found an island with two\r\ndeep bays, so that there appeared to be three islands. In the middle\r\none they established themselves, and afterwards built a city wall\r\nround the place. Then they wanted to give it a name, but disagreed\r\nabout it. Some wanted to call it Fryasburgt, others Neeftunia; but\r\nthe Magyars and Finns begged that it might be called Thyrhisburgt.\r\n\r\nThyr was the name of one of their idols, and it was upon his feast-day\r\nthat they had landed there; and in return they offered to recognise\r\nTeunis as their perpetual king. Teunis let himself be persuaded, and\r\nthe others would not make any quarrel about it. When they were well\r\nestablished, they sent some old seamen and Magyars on an expedition as\r\nfar as the town of Sidon; but at first the inhabitants of the coast\r\nwould have nothing to do with them, saying, You are only foreign\r\nadventurers whom we do not respect. But when we sold them some of\r\nour iron weapons, everything went well. They also wished to buy our\r\namber, and their inquiries about it were incessant. But Teunis, who was\r\nfar-seeing, pretended that he had no more iron weapons or amber. Then\r\nmerchants came and begged him to let them have twenty vessels, which\r\nthey would freight with the finest goods, and they would provide as\r\nmany people to row as he would require. Twelve ships were then laden\r\nwith wine, honey, tanned leather, and saddles and bridles mounted in\r\ngold, such as had never been seen before.\r\n\r\nTeunis sailed to the Flymeer with all this treasure, which so\r\nenchanted the Grevetman of Westflyland that he induced Teunis to\r\nbuild a warehouse at the mouth of the Flymeer. Afterwards this place\r\nwas called Almanaland, and the market where they traded at Wyringen\r\nwas called Toelaatmarkt. The mother advised that they should sell\r\neverything except iron weapons, but no attention was paid to what she\r\nsaid. As the Thyriers had thus free play, they came from far and near\r\nto take away our goods, to the loss of our seafaring people. Therefore\r\nit was resolved in a general assembly to allow only seven Thyrian\r\nships and no more in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the northernmost part of the Mediterranean there lies an island\r\nclose to the coast. They now came and asked to buy that, on which a\r\ngeneral council was held.\r\n\r\nThe mother's advice was asked, and she wished to see them at\r\nsome distance, so she saw no harm in it; but as we afterwards\r\nsaw what a mistake we had made, we called the island Missellia\r\n(Marseilles). Hereafter will be seen what reason we had. The Golen,\r\nas the missionary priests of Sidon were called, had observed that\r\nthe land there was thinly peopled, and was far from the mother. In\r\norder to make a favourable impression, they had themselves called\r\nin our language followers of the truth; but they had better have\r\nbeen called abstainers from the truth, or, in short, \"Triuwenden,\"\r\nas our seafaring people afterwards called them. When they were well\r\nestablished, their merchants exchanged their beautiful copper weapons\r\nand all sorts of jewels for our iron weapons and hides of wild beasts,\r\nwhich were abundant in our southern countries; but the Golen celebrated\r\nall sorts of vile and monstrous festivals, which the inhabitants\r\nof the coast promoted with their wanton women and sweet poisonous\r\nwine. If any of our people had so conducted himself that his life was\r\nin danger, the Golen afforded him a refuge, and sent him to Phonisia,\r\nthat is, Palmland. When he was settled there, they made him write to\r\nhis family, friends, and connections that the country was so good and\r\nthe people so happy that no one could form any idea of it. In Britain\r\nthere were plenty of men, but few women. When the Golen knew this,\r\nthey carried off girls everywhere and gave them to the Britons for\r\nnothing. So all these girls served their purpose to steal children\r\nfrom Wr-alda in order to give them to false gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW WE WILL WRITE ABOUT THE WAR BETWEEN THE BURGTMAAGDEN KALTA AND\r\nMIN-ERVA,\r\n\r\nAnd how we thereby lost all our southern lands and Britain to the\r\nGolen.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the southern mouth of the Rhine and the Scheldt there are seven\r\nislands, named after Frya's seven virgins of the week. In the middle\r\nof one island is the city of Walhallagara (Middelburg), and on the\r\nwalls of this city the following history is inscribed. Above it are\r\nthe words \"Read, learn, and watch.\"\r\n\r\nFive hundred and sixty-three years after the submersion of Atland--that\r\nis, 1600 years before Christ--a wise town priestess presided here,\r\nwhose name was Min-erva--called by the sailors Nyhellenia. This name\r\nwas well chosen, for her counsels were new and clear above all others.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Scheldt, at Flyburgt, Sijrhed presided. This\r\nmaiden was full of tricks. Her face was beautiful, and her tongue\r\nwas nimble; but the advice that she gave was always conveyed in\r\nmysterious terms. Therefore the mariners called her Kalta, and the\r\nlandsmen thought it was a title. In the last will of the dead mother,\r\nRosamond was named first, Min-erva second, and Sijrhed third in\r\nsuccession. Min-erva did not mind that, but Sijrhed was very much\r\noffended. Like a foreign princess, she wished to be honoured, feared,\r\nand worshipped; but Min-erva only desired to be loved. At last all\r\nthe sailors, even from Denmark and Flymeer, did homage to her. This\r\nhurt Sijrhed, because she wanted to excel Min-erva. In order to\r\ngive an impression of her great watchfulness, she had a cock put\r\non her banner. So then Min-erva went and put a sheep-dog and an owl\r\non her banner. The dog, she said, guards his master and his flock,\r\nand the owl watches that the mice shall not devastate the fields;\r\nbut the cock in his lewdness and his pride is only fit to murder his\r\nnearest relations. When Kalta found that her scheme had failed she\r\nwas still more vexed, so she secretly sent for the Magyars to teach\r\nher conjuring. When she had had enough of this she threw herself into\r\nthe hands of the Gauls; but all her malpractices did not improve her\r\nposition. When she saw that the sailors kept more and more aloof from\r\nher, she tried to win them back by fear. At the full moon, when the\r\nsea was stormy, she ran over the wild waves, calling to the sailors\r\nthat they would all be lost if they did not worship her. Then she\r\nblinded their eyes, so that they mistook land for water and water for\r\nland, and in this way many a good ship was totally lost. At the first\r\nwar-feast, when all her countrymen were armed, she brought casks of\r\nbeer, which she had drugged. When they were all drunk she mounted her\r\nwar-horse, leaning her head upon her spear. Sunrise could not be more\r\nbeautiful. When she saw that the eyes of all were fixed upon her,\r\nshe opened her lips and said:--\r\n\r\nSons and daughters of Frya, you know that in these last times we have\r\nsuffered much loss and misery because the sailors no longer come to\r\nbuy our paper, but you do not know what the reason of it is. I have\r\nlong kept silence about it, but can do so no longer. Listen, then,\r\nmy friends, that you may know on which side to show your teeth. On\r\nthe other side of the Scheldt, where from time to time there come\r\nships from all parts, they make now paper from pumpkin leaves, by\r\nwhich they save flax and outdo us. Now, as the making of paper was\r\nalways our principal industry, the mother willed that people should\r\nlearn it from us; but Min-erva has bewitched all the people--yes,\r\nbewitched, my friends--as well as all our cattle that died lately. I\r\nmust come out with it. If I were not Burgtmaagd, I should know what\r\nto do. I should burn the witch in her nest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had uttered these words she sped away to her citadel;\r\nbut the drunken people were so excited that they did not stop to weigh\r\nwhat they had heard. In mad haste they hurried over the Sandfal,\r\nand as night came on they burst into the citadel. However, Kalta\r\nagain missed her aim; for Min-erva, her maidens, and her lamp were\r\nall saved by the alertness of the seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE NOW COME TO THE HISTORY OF JON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJon, Jôn, Jhon, Jan, are all the same name, though the pronunciation\r\nvaries, as the seamen like to shorten everything to be able to make\r\nit easier to call. Jon--that is, \"Given\"--was a sea-king, born at\r\nAlberga, who sailed from the Flymeer with a fleet of 127 ships fitted\r\nout for a long voyage, and laden with amber, tin, copper, cloth, linen,\r\nfelt, otter-skins, beaver and rabbit skins. He would also have taken\r\npaper from here, but when he saw how Kalta had destroyed the citadel\r\nhe became so angry that he went off with all his people to Flyburgt,\r\nand out of revenge set fire to it. His admiral and some of his people\r\nsaved the lamp and the maidens, but they could not catch Sijrhed\r\n(or Kalta). She climbed up on the furthest battlement, and they\r\nthought she must be killed in the flames; but what happened? While\r\nall her people stood transfixed with horror, she appeared upon her\r\nsteed more beautiful than ever, calling to them, \"To Kalta!\" Then the\r\nother Schelda people poured out towards her. When the seamen saw that,\r\nthey shouted, \"We are for Min-erva!\" from which arose a war in which\r\nthousands were killed.\r\n\r\nAt this time Rosamond the mother, who had done all in her power by\r\ngentle means to preserve peace, when she saw how bad it was, made\r\nshort work of it. Immediately she sent messengers throughout all\r\nthe districts to call a general levy, which brought together all\r\nthe defenders of the country. The landsmen who were fighting were\r\nall caught, but Jon with his seamen took refuge on board his fleet,\r\ntaking with him the two lamps, as well as Min-erva and the maidens\r\nof both the citadels. Helprik, the chief, summoned him to appear;\r\nbut while all the soldiers were on the other side of the Scheldt,\r\nJon sailed back to the Flymeer, and then straight to our islands. His\r\nfighting men and many of our people took women and children on board,\r\nand when Jon saw that he and his people would be punished for their\r\nmisdeeds, he secretly took his departure. He did well, for all our\r\nislanders, and the other Scheldt people who had been fighting were\r\ntransported to Britain. This step was a mistake, for now came the\r\nbeginning of the end. Kalta, who, people said, could go as easily on\r\nthe water as on the land, went to the mainland and on to Missellia\r\n(Marseilles). Then came the Gauls out of the Mediterranean Sea with\r\ntheir ships to Cadiz, and along all our coasts, and fell upon Britain;\r\nbut they could not make any good footing there, because the government\r\nwas powerful and the exiles were still Frisians. But now came Kalta and\r\nsaid: You were born free, and for small offences have been sent away,\r\nnot for your own improvement, but to get tin by your labour. If you\r\nwish to be free again, and take my advice, and live under my care,\r\ncome away. I will provide you with arms, and will watch over you. The\r\nnews flew through the land like lightning, and before the carrier's\r\nwheel had made one revolution she was mistress of all the Thyriers\r\nin all our southern states as far as the Seine. She built herself a\r\ncitadel on the high land to the north, and called it Kaltasburgh. It\r\nstill exists under the name of Kêrenak. From this castle she ruled\r\nas a true mother, against their will, not for her followers, but over\r\nthem, who were thenceforth called Kelts. The Gauls gradually obtained\r\ndominion over the whole of Britain, partly because they no longer\r\nhad any citadel; secondly, because they had there no Burgtmaagden;\r\nand thirdly, because they had no real lamps. From all these causes\r\nthe people could not learn anything. They were stupid and foolish,\r\nand having allowed the Gauls to rob them of their arms, they were\r\nled about like a bull with a ring in his nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW WE SHALL WRITE HOW IT FARED WITH JON.\r\n\r\nIT IS INSCRIBED AT TEXLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen years after Jon went away, there arrived three ships in the\r\nFlymeer; the people cried Huzza! (What a blessing!) and from their\r\naccounts the mother had this written.\r\n\r\nWhen Jon reached the Mediterranean Sea, the reports of the Gauls had\r\npreceded him, so that on the nearest Italian coast he was nowhere\r\nsafe. Therefore he went with his fleet straight over to Lybia. There\r\nthe black men wanted to catch them and eat them. At last they came\r\nto Tyre, but Min-erva said, Keep clear, for here the air has been\r\nlong poisoned by the priests. The king was a descendant of Teunis,\r\nas we were afterwards informed; but as the priests wished to have a\r\nking, who, according to their ideas, was of long descent, they deified\r\nTeunis, to the vexation of his followers. After they had passed Tyre,\r\nthe Tyrians seized one of the rearmost ships, and as the ship was\r\ntoo far behind us, we could not take it back again; but Jon swore to\r\nbe revenged for it. When night came, Jon bent his course towards the\r\ndistant Krekalanden. At last they arrived at a country that looked\r\nvery barren, but they found a harbour there. Here, said Min-erva,\r\nwe need not perhaps have any fear of princes or priests, as they\r\nalways look out for rich fat lands. When they entered the harbour,\r\nthere was not room for all the ships, and yet most of the people were\r\ntoo cowardly to go any further. Then Jon, who wished to get away, went\r\nwith his spear and banner, calling to the young people, to know who\r\nwould volunteer to share his adventures. Min-erva did the same thing,\r\nbut she wished to remain there. The greater part stopped with Min-erva,\r\nbut the young sailors went with Jon. Jon took the lamp of Kalta and\r\nher maidens with him. Min-erva retained her lamp and her own maidens.\r\n\r\nBetween the near and the distant coasts of Italy Jon found some\r\nislands, which he thought desirable. Upon the largest he built a city\r\nin the wood between the mountains. From the smaller islands he made\r\nexpeditions for vengeance on the Tyrians, and plundered their ships\r\nand their lands. Therefore these islands were called Insulæ Piratarum,\r\nas well as Johannis Insulæ.\r\n\r\nWhen Min-erva had examined the country which is called by the\r\ninhabitants Attica, she saw that the people were all goatherds,\r\nand that they lived on meat, wild roots, herbs, and honey. They were\r\nclothed in skins, and had their dwellings on the slopes (hellinga)\r\nof the hills, wherefore they were called Hellingers. At first they\r\nran away, but when they found that we did not attack them, they came\r\nback and showed great friendship. Min-erva asked if we might settle\r\nthere peaceably. This was agreed to on the condition that we should\r\nhelp them to fight against their neighbours, who came continually to\r\ncarry away their children and to rob their dwellings. Then we built\r\na citadel at an hour's distance from the harbour. By the advice of\r\nMin-erva it was called Athens, because, she said, those who come\r\nafter us ought to know that we are not here by cunning or violence,\r\nbut were received as friends (âtha). While we were building the citadel\r\nthe principal personages came to see us, and when they saw that we had\r\nno slaves it did not please them, and they gave her to understand it,\r\nas they thought that she was a princess. But Min-erva said, How did\r\nyou get your slaves? They answered, We bought some and took others\r\nin war. Min-erva replied, If nobody would buy slaves they would not\r\nsteal your children, and you would have no wars about it. If you wish\r\nto remain our allies, you will free your slaves. The chiefs did not\r\nlike this, and wanted to drive us away; but the most enlightened of\r\nthe people came and helped us to build our citadel, which was built\r\nof stone.\r\n\r\nThis is the history of Jon and of Min-erva.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished their story they asked respectfully for iron\r\nweapons; for, said they, our foes are powerful, but if we have good\r\narms we can withstand them. When this had been agreed to, the people\r\nasked if Frya's customs would flourish in Athens and in other parts\r\nof Greece (Krekalanden). The mother answered, If the distant Greeks\r\nbelong to the direct descent of Frya, then they will flourish; but if\r\nthey do not descend from Frya, then there will be a long contention\r\nabout it, because the carrier must make five thousand revolutions of\r\nhis Juul before Finda's people will be ripe for liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS ABOUT THE GEERTMEN.\r\n\r\nWhen Hellenia or Min-erva died, the priests pretended to be with us,\r\nand in order to make it appear so, they deified Hellenia. They refused\r\nto have any other mother chosen, saying that they feared there was\r\nno one among her maidens whom they could trust as they had trusted\r\nMin-erva, surnamed Nyhellenia.\r\n\r\nBut we would not recognise Min-erva as a goddess, because she herself\r\nhad told us that no one could be perfectly good except the spirit of\r\nWr-alda. Therefore we chose Geert Pyre's daughter for our mother. When\r\nthe priests saw that they could not fry their herrings on our fire\r\n(have everything their own way), they left Athens, and said that we\r\nrefused to acknowledge Min-erva as a goddess out of envy, because she\r\nhad shown so much affection to the natives. Thereupon they gave the\r\npeople statues of her, declaring that they might ask of them whatever\r\nthey liked, as long as they were obedient to her. By these kinds\r\nof tales the stupid people were estranged from us, and at last they\r\nattacked us; but as we had built our stone city wall with two horns\r\ndown to the sea, they could not get at us. Then, lo and behold! an\r\nEgyptian high priest, bright of eye, clear of brain, and enlightened\r\nof mind, whose name was Cecrops, came to give them advice.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw that with his people he could not storm our wall, he sent\r\nmessengers to Tyre. Thereupon there arrived three hundred ships full\r\nof wild mountain soldiers, which sailed unexpectedly into our haven\r\nwhile we were defending the walls. When they had taken our harbour,\r\nthe wild soldiers wanted to plunder the village and our ships--one\r\nhad already ravished a girl--but Cecrops would not permit it; and\r\nthe Tyrian sailors, who still had Frisian blood in their veins, said,\r\nIf you do that we will burn our ships, and you shall never see your\r\nmountains again. Cecrops, who had no inclination towards murder\r\nor devastation, sent messengers to Geert, requiring her to give\r\nup the citadel, offering her free exit with all her live and dead\r\nproperty, and her followers the same. The wisest of the citizens,\r\nseeing that they could not hold the citadel, advised Geert to accept\r\nat once, before Cecrops became furious and changed his mind. Three\r\nmonths afterwards Geert departed with the best of Frya's sons, and\r\nseven times twelve ships. Soon after they had left the harbour they\r\nfell in with at least thirty ships coming from Tyre with women and\r\nchildren. They were on their way to Athens, but when they heard how\r\nthings stood there they went with Geert. The sea-king of the Tyrians\r\nbrought them altogether through the strait which at that time ran\r\ninto the Red Sea (now re-established as the Suez Canal). At last\r\nthey landed at the Punjab, called in our language the Five Rivers,\r\nbecause five rivers flow together to the sea. Here they settled, and\r\ncalled it Geertmania. The King of Tyre afterwards, seeing that all\r\nhis best sailors were gone, sent all his ships with his wild soldiers\r\nto catch them, dead or alive. When they arrived at the strait, both\r\nthe sea and the earth trembled. The land was upheaved so that all the\r\nwater ran out of the strait, and the muddy shores were raised up like\r\na rampart. This happened on account of the virtues of the Geertmen,\r\nas every one can plainly understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND AND FIVE AFTER ATLAND WAS SUBMERGED, THIS\r\nWAS INSCRIBED ON THE EASTERN WALL OF FRYASBURGT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter twelve years had elapsed without our seeing any Italians in\r\nAlmanland, there came three ships, finer than any that we possessed\r\nor had ever seen.\r\n\r\nOn the largest of them was a king of the Jonischen Islands whose name\r\nwas Ulysses, the fame of whose wisdom was great. To him a priestess\r\nhad prophesied that he should become the king of all Italy provided he\r\ncould obtain a lamp that had been lighted at the lamp in Texland. For\r\nthis purpose he had brought great treasures with him, above all,\r\njewels for women more beautiful than had ever been seen before. They\r\nwere from Troy, a town that the Greeks had taken. All these treasures\r\nhe offered to the mother, but the mother would have nothing to do with\r\nthem. At last, when he found that there was nothing to be got from\r\nher, he went to Walhallagara (Walcheren). There there was established\r\na Burgtmaagd whose name was Kaat, but who was commonly called Kalip,\r\nbecause her lower lip stuck out like a mast-head. Here he tarried for\r\nyears, to the scandal of all that knew it. According to the report\r\nof the maidens, he obtained a lamp from her; but it did him no good,\r\nbecause when he got to sea his ship was lost, and he was taken up\r\nnaked and destitute by another ship. There was left behind by this\r\nking a writer of pure Frya's blood, born in the new harbour of Athens,\r\nwho wrote for us what follows about Athens, from which may be seen\r\nhow truly the mother Hel-licht spoke when she said that the customs\r\nof Frya could never take firm hold in Athens.\r\n\r\nFrom the other Greeks you will have heard a great deal of bad about\r\nCecrops, because he was not in good repute; but I dare affirm that he\r\nwas an enlightened man; very renowned both among the inhabitants and\r\namong us, for he was against oppression, unlike the other priests,\r\nand was virtuous, and knew how to value the wisdom of distant\r\nnations. Knowing that, he permitted us to live according to our own\r\nAsegaboek. There was a story current that he was favourable to us\r\nbecause he was the son of a Frisian girl and an Egyptian priest: the\r\nreason of this was that he had blue eyes, and that many of our girls\r\nhad been stolen and sold to Egypt, but he never confirmed this. However\r\nit may have been, certain it is that he showed us more friendship than\r\nall the other priests together. When he died, his successors soon began\r\nto tear up our charters, and gradually to enact so many unsuitable\r\nstatutes that at long last nothing remained of liberty but the shadow\r\nand the name. Besides, they would not allow the laws to be written,\r\nso that the knowledge of them was hidden from us. Formerly all the\r\ncases in Athens were pleaded in our language, but afterwards in both\r\nlanguages, and at last in the native language only. At first the men of\r\nAthens only married women of our own race, but the young men as they\r\ngrew up with the girls of the country took them to wife. The bastard\r\nchildren of this connection were the handsomest and cleverest in the\r\nworld; but they were likewise the wickedest, wavering between the two\r\nparties, paying no regard to laws or customs except where they suited\r\ntheir own interests. As long as a ray of Frya's spirit existed, all\r\nthe building materials were for common use, and no one might build a\r\nhouse larger or better than his neighbours; but when some degenerate\r\ntownspeople got rich by sea-voyages and by the silver that their slaves\r\ngot in the silver countries, they went to live out on the hills or\r\nin the valleys. There, behind high enclosures of trees or walls,\r\nthey built palaces with costly furniture, and in order to remain\r\nin good odour with the nasty priests, they placed there likenesses\r\nof false gods and unchaste statues. Sometimes the dirty priests and\r\nprinces wished for the boys rather than the girls, and often led them\r\nastray from the paths of virtue by rich presents or by force. Because\r\nriches were more valued by this lost and degenerate race than virtue\r\nor honour, one sometimes saw boys dressed in splendid flowing robes,\r\nto the disgrace of their parents and maidens, and to the shame of\r\ntheir own sex. If our simple parents came to a general assembly at\r\nAthens and made complaints, a cry was raised, Hear, hear! there is\r\na sea-monster going to speak. Such is Athens become, like a morass\r\nin a tropical country full of leeches, toads, and poisonous snakes,\r\nin which no man of decent habits can set his foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS INSCRIBED IN ALL OUR CITADELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow our Denmark was lost to us 1602 years after the submersion of\r\nAtland. Through the mad wantonness of Wodin, Magy had become master\r\nof the east part of Scandinavia. They dare not come over the hills\r\nand over the sea. The mother would not prevent it. She said, I see\r\nno danger in their weapons, but much in taking the Scandinavians\r\nback again, because they are so degenerate and spoilt. The general\r\nassembly were of the same opinion. Therefore it was left to him. A\r\ngood hundred years ago Denmark began to trade; they gave their iron\r\nweapons in exchange for gold ornaments, as well as for copper and\r\niron-ore. The mother sent messengers to advise them to have nothing\r\nto do with this trade. There was danger to their morals in it, and if\r\nthey lost their morals they would soon lose their liberty. But the\r\nDenmarkers paid no attention to her. They did not believe that they\r\ncould lose their morals, therefore they would not listen to her. At\r\nlast they were at a loss themselves for weapons and necessaries, and\r\nthis difficulty was their punishment. Their bodies were brilliantly\r\nadorned, but their cupboards and their sheds were empty. Just one\r\nhundred years after the first ship with provisions sailed from\r\nthe coast, poverty and want made their appearance, hunger spread\r\nher wings all over the country, dissension marched proudly about\r\nthe streets and into the houses, charity found no place, and unity\r\ndeparted. The child asked its mother for food; she had no food to\r\ngive, only jewels. The women applied to their husbands, the husbands\r\nappealed to the counts; the counts had nothing to give, or if they had,\r\nthey hid it away. Now the jewels must be sold, but while the sailors\r\nwere away for that purpose, the frost came and laid a plank upon the\r\nsea and the strait (the Sound). When the frost had made the bridge,\r\nvigilance ceased in the land, and treachery took its place. Instead\r\nof watching on the shores, they put their horses in their sledges\r\nand drove off to Scandinavia. Then the Scandinavians, who hungered\r\nafter the land of their forefathers, came to Denmark. One bright\r\nnight they all came. Now, they said, we have a right to the land of\r\nour fathers; and while they were fighting about it, the Finns came to\r\nthe defenceless villages and ran away with the children. As they had\r\nno good weapons, they lost the battle, and with it their freedom,\r\nand Magy became master. All this was the consequence of their not\r\nreading Frya's Tex, and neglecting her counsels. There are some who\r\nthink that they were betrayed by the counts, and that the maidens\r\nhad long suspected it; but if any one attempted to speak about it,\r\nhis mouth was shut by golden chains.\r\n\r\nWe can express no opinion about it, we can only say to you, Do not\r\ntrust too much to the wisdom of your princes or of your maidens;\r\nbut if you wish to keep things straight, everybody must watch over\r\nhis own passions, as well as the general welfare.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards Magy himself came with a fleet of light boats\r\nto steal the lamp from the mother of Texland. This wicked deed he\r\naccomplished one stormy winter night, while the wind roared and the\r\nhail rattled against the windows. The watchman on the tower hearing\r\nthe noise, lighted his torch. As soon as the light from the tower fell\r\nupon the bastion, he saw that already armed men had got over the wall.\r\n\r\nHe immediately gave the alarm, but it was too late. Before the guard\r\nwas ready, there were two thousand people battering the gate. The\r\nstruggle did not last long. As the guard had not kept a good watch,\r\nthey were overwhelmed. While the fight was going on, a rascally\r\nFinn stole into the chamber of the mother, and would have done her\r\nviolence. She resisted him, and threw him down against the wall. When\r\nhe got up, he ran his sword through her: If you will not have me,\r\nyou shall have my sword. A Danish soldier came behind him and clave\r\nhis head in two. There came from it a stream of black blood and a\r\nwreath of blue flame.\r\n\r\nThe Magy had the mother nursed on his own ship. As soon as she was well\r\nenough to speak clearly, the Magy told her that she must sail with him,\r\nbut that she should keep her lamp and her maidens, and should hold a\r\nstation higher than she had ever done before. Moreover, he said that\r\nhe should ask her, in presence of all his chief men, if he would become\r\nthe ruler of all the country and people of Frya; that she must declare\r\nand affirm this, or he would let her die a painful death. Then, when\r\nhe had gathered all his chiefs around her bed, he asked, in a loud\r\nvoice, Frana, since you are a prophetess, shall I become ruler over\r\nall the lands and people of Frya? Frana did as if she took no notice\r\nof him; but at last she opened her lips, and said: My eyes are dim,\r\nbut the other light dawns upon my soul. Yes, I see it. Hear, Irtha,\r\nand rejoice with me. At the time of the submersion of Atland, the\r\nfirst spoke of the Juul stood at the top. After that it went down,\r\nand our freedom with it. When two spokes, or two thousand years,\r\nshall have rolled down, the sons shall arise who have been bred\r\nof the fornication of the princes and priests with the people, and\r\nshall witness against their fathers. They shall all fall by murder,\r\nbut what they have proclaimed shall endure, and shall bear fruit in\r\nthe bosoms of able men, like good seed which is laid in thy lap. Yet a\r\nthousand years shall the spoke descend, and sink deeper in darkness,\r\nand in the blood shed over you by the wickedness of the princes and\r\npriests. After that, the dawn shall begin to glow. When they perceive\r\nthis, the false princes and priests will strive and wrestle against\r\nfreedom; but freedom, love, and unity will take the people under their\r\nprotection, and rise out of the vile pool. The light which at first\r\nonly glimmered shall gradually become a flame. The blood of the bad\r\nshall flow over your surface, but you must not absorb it. At last\r\nthe poisoned animals shall eat it, and die of it. All the stories\r\nthat have been written in praise of the princes and priests shall\r\nbe committed to the flames. Thenceforth your children shall live in\r\npeace. When she had finished speaking she sank down.\r\n\r\nThe Magy, who had not understood her, shrieked out, I have asked\r\nyou if I should become master of all the lands and people of Frya,\r\nand now you have been speaking to another. Frana raised herself up,\r\nstared at him, and said, Before seven days have passed your soul\r\nshall haunt the tombs with the night-birds, and your body shall be at\r\nthe bottom of the sea. Very good, said the Magy, swelling with rage;\r\nsay that I am coming. Then he said to his executioners, Throw this\r\nwoman overboard. This was the end of the last of the mothers. We do\r\nnot ask for revenge. Time will provide that; but a thousand thousand\r\ntimes we will call with Frya, Watch! watch! watch!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IT FARED AFTERWARDS WITH THE MAGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the murder of the mother, he brought the lamp and the\r\nmaidens into his own ship, together with all the booty that he\r\nchose. Afterwards he went up the Flymeer because he wished to take\r\nthe maiden of Medeasblik or Stavoren and install her as mother;\r\nbut there they were on their guard. The seafaring men of Stavoren\r\nand Alderga would gladly have gone to Jon, but the great fleet was\r\nout on a distant voyage; so they proceeded in their small fleet to\r\nMedeasblik, and kept themselves concealed in a sheltered place behind\r\ntrees. The Magy approached Medeasblik in broad daylight; nevertheless,\r\nhis men boldly stormed the citadel. But as they landed from the boats,\r\nour people sallied forth from the creek, and shot their arrows with\r\nballs of burning turpentine upon the fleet. They were so well aimed\r\nthat many of the ships were instantly on fire. Those left to guard\r\nthe ships shot at us, but they could not reach us. When at last a\r\nburning ship drifted towards the ship of the Magy, he ordered the man\r\nat the helm to sheer off, but this man was the Dane who had cleft the\r\nhead of the Finn. He said, You sent our Eeremoeder to the bottom of\r\nthe sea to say that you were coming. In the bustle of the fight you\r\nmight forget it; now I will take care that you keep your word. The\r\nMagy tried to push him off, but the sailor, a real Frisian and strong\r\nas an ox, clutched his head with both hands, and pitched him into\r\nthe surging billows. Then he hoisted up his brown shield, and sailed\r\nstraight to our fleet. Thus the maidens came unhurt to us; but the\r\nlamp was extinguished, and no one knew how that had happened. When\r\nthose on the uninjured ships heard that the Magy was drowned, they\r\nsailed away, because their crews were Danes. When the fleet was far\r\nenough off, our sailors turned and shot their burning arrows at the\r\nFinns. When the Finns saw that, and found that they were betrayed,\r\nthey fell into confusion, and lost all discipline and order. At this\r\nmoment the garrison sallied forth from the citadel. Those who resisted\r\nwere killed, and those who fled found their death in the marshes of\r\nthe Krylinger wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the sailors were in the creek, there was a wag from Stavoren\r\namong them, who said, Medea may well laugh if we rescue her from\r\nher citadel. Upon this, the maidens gave to the creek the name Medea\r\nmêilakkia (Lake of Medea). The occurrences that happened after this\r\neverybody can remember. The maidens ought to relate it in their\r\nown way, and have it well inscribed. We consider that our task is\r\nfulfilled. Hail!\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE END OF THE BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF ADELBROST AND APOLLONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Adelbrost, the son of Apol and Adela. I was elected by my\r\npeople as Grevetman over the Lindaoorden. Therefore I will continue\r\nthis book in the same way as my mother has spoken it.\r\n\r\nAfter the Magy was killed and Fryasburgt was restored, a mother\r\nhad to be chosen. The mother had not named her successor, and her\r\nwill was nowhere to be found. Seven months later a general assembly\r\nwas called at Grênegâ (Groningen), because it was on the boundary of\r\nSaxamarken. My mother was chosen, but she would not be the mother. She\r\nhad saved my father's life, in consequence of which they had fallen\r\nin love with each other, and she wished to marry. Many people wished\r\nmy mother to alter her decision, but she said an Eeremoeder ought to\r\nbe as pure in her conscience as she appears outwardly, and to have\r\nthe same love for all her children. Now, as I love Apol better than\r\nanything else in the world, I cannot be such a mother. Thus spoke and\r\nreasoned Adela, but all the other maidens wished to be the mother. Each\r\nstate was in favour of its own maiden, and would not yield. Therefore\r\nnone was chosen, and the kingdom was without any restraint. From what\r\nfollows you will understand Liudgert, the king who had lately died,\r\nhad been chosen in the lifetime of the mother, and seemingly with\r\nthe love and confidence of all the states. It was his turn to live\r\nat the great court of Dokhem, and in the lifetime of the mother\r\ngreat honour was done to him there, as there were more messengers\r\nand knights there than had ever been seen there before. But now he\r\nwas lonely and forsaken, because every one was afraid that he would\r\nset himself above the law, and rule them like the slave kings. Every\r\nheadman imagined that he did enough if he looked after his own state,\r\nand did not care for the others. With the Burgtmaagden it was still\r\nworse. Each of them depended upon her own judgment, and whenever a\r\nGrevetman did anything without her, she raised distrust between him\r\nand his people. If any case happened which concerned several states,\r\nand one maid had been consulted, the rest all exclaimed that she had\r\nspoken only in the interest of her own state. By such proceedings\r\nthey brought disputes among the states, and so severed the bond of\r\nunion that the people of one state were jealous of those of the rest,\r\nor at least considered them as strangers; the consequence of which\r\nwas that the Gauls or Truwenden (Druids) took possession of our lands\r\nas far as the Scheldt, and the Magy as far as the Wesara. How this\r\nhappened my mother has explained, otherwise this book would not have\r\nbeen written, although I have lost all hope that it would be of any\r\nuse. I do not write in the hope that I shall win back the land or\r\npreserve it: in my opinion that is impossible. I write only for the\r\nfuture generations, that they may all know in what way we were lost,\r\nand that each may learn that every crime brings its punishment.\r\n\r\nMy name is Apollonia. Two-and-thirty days after my mother's death\r\nmy brother Adelbrost was found murdered on the wharf, his skull\r\nfractured and his limbs torn asunder. My father, who lay ill, died of\r\nfright. Then my younger brother, Apol, sailed from here to the west\r\nside of Schoonland. There he built a citadel named Lindasburgt, in\r\norder there to avenge our wrong. Wr-alda accorded him many years for\r\nthat. He had five sons, who all caused fear to Magy, and brought fame\r\nto my brother. After the death of my mother and my brother, all the\r\nbravest of the land joined together and made a covenant, called the\r\nAdelbond. In order to preserve us from injury, they brought me and my\r\nyoungest brother, Adelhirt, to the burgt--me to the maidens, and him to\r\nthe warriors. When I was thirty years old I was chosen as Burgtmaagd,\r\nand my brother at fifty was chosen Grevetman. From mother's side my\r\nbrother was the sixth, but from father's side the third. By right,\r\ntherefore, his descendants could not put \"overa Linda\" after their\r\nnames, but they all wished to do it in honour of their mother. In\r\naddition to this, there was given to us also a copy of \"The Book of\r\nAdela's Followers.\" That gave me the most pleasure, because it came\r\ninto the world by my mother's wisdom. In the burgt I have found other\r\nwritings also in praise of my mother. All this I will write afterwards.\r\n\r\nThese are the writings left by Bruno, who was the writer of this\r\nburgt. After the followers of Adela had made copies, each in his\r\nkingdom, of what was inscribed upon the walls of the burgt, they\r\nresolved to choose a mother. For this purpose a general assembly\r\nwas called at this farm. By the first advice of Adela, Teuntje was\r\nrecommended. That would have been arranged, only that my Burgtmaagd\r\nasked to speak: she had always supposed that she would be chosen\r\nmother, because she was at the burgt from which mothers had generally\r\nbeen chosen. When she was allowed to speak, she opened her false\r\nlips and said: You all seem to place great value on Adela's advice,\r\nbut that shall not shut my mouth. Who is Adela, and whence comes it\r\nthat you respect her so highly? She was what I am now, a Burgtmaagd\r\nof this place; is she, then, wiser and better than I and all the\r\nothers? or is she more conversant with our laws and customs? If that\r\nhad been the case, she would have become mother when she was chosen;\r\nbut instead of that, she preferred matrimony to a single life, watching\r\nover herself and her people. She is certainly very clear-sighted,\r\nbut my eyes are far from being dim. I have observed that she is very\r\nmuch attached to her husband, which is very praiseworthy; but I see,\r\nlikewise, that Teuntje is Apol's niece. Further I say nothing.\r\n\r\nThe principal people understood very well which way the wind\r\nblew with her; but among the people there arose disputes, and as\r\nmost of the people came from here, they would not give the honour\r\nto Teuntje. The conferences were ended, knives were drawn, and no\r\nmother was chosen. Shortly afterwards one of our messengers killed his\r\ncomrade. As he had been a man of good character hitherto, my Burgtmaagd\r\nhad permission to help him over the frontier; but instead of helping\r\nhim over to Twiskland (Germany), she fled with him herself to Wesara,\r\nand then to the Magy. The Magy, who wished to please his sons of Frya,\r\nappointed her mother of Godaburgt, in Schoonland; but she wished for\r\nmore, and she told him that if he could get Adela out of the way\r\nhe might become master of the whole of Frya's land. She said she\r\nhated Adela for having prevented her from being chosen mother. If\r\nhe would promise her Texland, her messenger should serve as guide to\r\nhis warriors. All this was confessed by her messenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND WRITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen months after the last general assembly, at the festival of the\r\nharvest month, everybody gave himself up to pleasure and merry-making,\r\nand no one thought of anything but diversion; but Wr-alda wished\r\nto teach us that watchfulness should never be relaxed. In the\r\nmidst of the festivities the fog came and enveloped every place in\r\ndarkness. Cheerfulness melted away, but watchfulness did not take its\r\nplace. The coastguard deserted their beacons, and no one was to be\r\nseen on any of the paths. When the fog rose, the sun scarcely appeared\r\namong the clouds; but the people all came out shouting with joy, and\r\nthe young folks went about singing to their bagpipes, filling the air\r\nwith their melody. But while every one was intoxicated with pleasure,\r\ntreachery had landed with its horses and riders. As usual, darkness\r\nhad favoured the wicked, and they had slipped in through the paths\r\nof Linda's wood. Before Adela's door twelve girls led twelve lambs,\r\nand twelve boys led twelve calves. A young Saxon bestrode a wild bull\r\nwhich he had caught and tamed. They were decked with all kinds of\r\nflowers, and the girls' dresses were fringed with gold from the Rhine.\r\n\r\nWhen Adela came out of her house, a shower of flowers fell on her head;\r\nthey all cheered loudly, and the fifes of the boys were heard over\r\neverything. Poor Adela! poor people! how short will be your joy! When\r\nthe procession was out of sight, a troop of Magyar soldiers rushed\r\nup to Adela's house. Her father and her husband were sitting on the\r\nsteps. The door was open, and within stood Adelbrost her son. When he\r\nsaw the danger of his parents, he took his bow from the wall and shot\r\nthe leader of the pirates, who staggered and fell on the grass. The\r\nsecond and third met a similar fate. In the meantime his parents had\r\nseized their weapons, and went slowly to Jon's house. They would soon\r\nhave been taken, but Adela came. She had learned in the burgt to use\r\nall kinds of weapons. She was seven feet high, and her sword was the\r\nsame length. She waved it three times over her head, and each time\r\na knight bit the earth. Reinforcements came, and the pirates were\r\nmade prisoners; but too late--an arrow had penetrated her bosom! The\r\ntreacherous Magy had poisoned it, and she died of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELEGY OF THE BURGTMAAGD.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, departed friend, thousands are arrived, and more are coming. They\r\nwish to hear the wisdom of Adela. Truly, she was a princess, for she\r\nhad always been the leader. O Sorrow, what good can you do!\r\n\r\nHer garments of linen and wool she spun and wove herself. How\r\ncould she add to her beauty? Not with pearls, for her teeth were\r\nmore white; not with gold, for her tresses were more brilliant; not\r\nwith precious stones, for her eyes, though soft as those of a lamb,\r\nwere so lustrous that you could scarcely look into them. But why\r\ndo I talk of beauty? Frya was certainly not more beautiful; yes, my\r\nfriends, Frya, who possessed seven perfections, of which each of her\r\ndaughters inherited one, or at most three. But even if she had been\r\nugly, she would still have been dear to us. Is she warlike? Listen, my\r\nfriend. Adela was the only daughter of our Grevetman. She stood seven\r\nfeet high. Her wisdom exceeded her stature, and her courage was equal\r\nto both together. Here is an instance. There was once a turf-ground on\r\nfire. Three children got upon yonder gravestone. There was a furious\r\nwind. The people were all shouting, and the mother was helpless. Then\r\ncame Adela. What are you all standing still here for? she cried. Try\r\nto help them, and Wr-alda will give you strength. Then she ran\r\nto the Krylwood and got some elder branches, of which she made a\r\nbridge. The others then came to assist her, and the children were\r\nsaved. The children bring flowers to the place every year. There came\r\nonce three Phoenician sailors, who began to ill-treat the children,\r\nwhen Adela, having heard their screams, beat the scoundrels till they\r\nwere insensible, and then, to prove to them what miserable wretches\r\nthey were, she tied them all three to a spindle.\r\n\r\nThe foreign lords came to look after their people, and when they saw\r\nhow ridiculously they had been treated they were very angry, till\r\nthey were told what had happened. Upon that they bowed themselves\r\nbefore Adela, and kissed the hem of her garment. But come, distant\r\nliving friend. The birds of the forest fled before the numerous\r\nvisitors. Come, friend, and you shall hear her wisdom. By the\r\ngravestone of which mention has already been made her body is\r\nburied. Upon the stone the following words are inscribed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tread softly, for here lies Adela.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old legend which is written on the outside wall of the city tower\r\nis not written in \"The Book of Adela's Followers.\" Why this has been\r\nneglected I do not know; but this book is my own, so I will put it\r\nin out of regard to my relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLDEST DOCTRINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHail to all the well-intentioned children of Frya! Through them the\r\nearth shall become holy. Learn and announce to the people Wr-alda is\r\nthe ancient of ancients, for he created all things. Wr-alda is all in\r\nall, for he is eternal and everlasting. Wr-alda is omnipresent but\r\ninvisible, and therefore is called a spirit. All that we can see of\r\nhim are the created beings who come to life through him and go again,\r\nbecause from Wr-alda all things proceed and return to him. Wr-alda is\r\nthe beginning and the end. Wr-alda is the only almighty being, because\r\nfrom him all other strength comes, and returns to him. Therefore\r\nhe alone is the creator, and nothing exists without him. Wr-alda\r\nestablished eternal principles, upon which the laws of creation were\r\nfounded, and no good laws could stand on any other foundation. But\r\nalthough everything is derived from Wr-alda, the wickedness of men\r\ndoes not come from him. Wickedness comes from heaviness, carelessness,\r\nand stupidity; therefore they may well be injurious to men, but never\r\nto Wr-alda. Wr-alda is wisdom, and the laws that he has made are the\r\nbooks from which we learn, nor is any wisdom to be found or gathered\r\nbut in them. Men may see a great deal, but Wr-alda sees everything. Men\r\ncan learn a great deal, but Wr-alda knows everything. Men can discover\r\nmuch, but to Wr-alda everything is open. Mankind are male and female,\r\nbut Wr-alda created both. Mankind love and hate, but Wr-alda alone\r\nis just. Therefore Wr-alda is good, and there is no good without\r\nhim. In the progress of time all creation alters and changes, but\r\ngoodness alone is unalterable; and since Wr-alda is good, he cannot\r\nchange. As he endures, he alone exists; everything else is show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PART OF THE OLDEST DOCTRINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong Finda's people there are false teachers, who, by their\r\nover-inventiveness, have become so wicked that they make themselves\r\nand their adherents believe that they are the best part of Wr-alda,\r\nthat their spirit is the best part of Wr-alda's spirit, and that\r\nWr-alda can only think by the help of their brains.\r\n\r\nThat every creature is a part of Wr-alda's eternal being, that they\r\nhave stolen from us; but their false reasoning and ungovernable pride\r\nhave brought them on the road to ruin. If their spirit was Wr-alda's\r\nspirit, then Wr-alda would be very stupid, instead of being sensible\r\nand wise; for their spirit labours to create beautiful statues,\r\nwhich they afterwards worship. Finda's people are a wicked people,\r\nfor although they presumptuously pretend among themselves that they\r\nare gods, they proclaim the unconsecrated false gods, and declare\r\neverywhere that these idols created the world and all that therein\r\nis--greedy idols, full of envy and anger, who desire to be served\r\nand honoured by the people, and who exact bloody sacrifices and rich\r\nofferings; but these presumptuous and false men, who call themselves\r\nGod's servants and priests, receive and collect everything in the\r\nname of the idols that have no real existence, for their own benefit.\r\n\r\nThey do all this with an easy conscience, as they think themselves\r\ngods not answerable to any one. If there are some who discover their\r\ntricks and expose them, they hand them over to the executioners to\r\nbe burnt for their calumnies, with solemn ceremonies in honour of the\r\nfalse gods; but really in order to save themselves. In order that our\r\nchildren may be protected against their idolatrous doctrine, the duty\r\nof the maidens is to make them learn by heart the following: Wr-alda\r\nexisted before all things, and will endure after all things. Wr-alda\r\nis also eternal and everlasting, therefore nothing exists without\r\nhim. From Wr-alda's life sprang time and all living things, and his\r\nlife takes away time and every other thing. These things must be made\r\nclear and manifest in every way, so that they can be made clear and\r\ncomprehensible to all. When we have learned thus much, then we say\r\nfurther: In what regards our existence, we are a part of Wr-alda's\r\neverlasting being, like the existence of all created beings; but as\r\nregards our form, our qualities, our spirit, and all our thoughts,\r\nthese do not belong to the being. All these are passing things which\r\nappear through Wr-alda's life, and which appear through his wisdom,\r\nand not otherwise; but whereas his life is continually progressing,\r\nnothing can remain stationary, therefore all created things change\r\ntheir locality, their form, and their thoughts. So neither the earth\r\nnor any other created object can say, I am; but rather, I was. So no\r\nman can say, I think; but rather, I thought. The boy is greater and\r\ndifferent from the child; he has different desires, inclinations,\r\nand thoughts. The man and father feels and thinks differently from\r\nthe boy, the old man just the same. Everybody knows that. Besides,\r\neverybody knows and must acknowledge that he is now changing, that he\r\nchanges every minute even while he says, I am, and that his thoughts\r\nchange even while he says, I think. Instead, then, of imitating\r\nFinda's wicked people, and saying, I am the best part of Wr-alda,\r\nand through us alone he can think, we proclaim everywhere where it\r\nis necessary, We, Frya's children, exist through Wr-alda's life--in\r\nthe beginning mean and base, but always advancing towards perfection\r\nwithout ever attaining the excellence of Wr-alda himself. Our spirit\r\nis not Wr-alda's spirit, it is merely a shadow of it. When Wr-alda\r\ncreated us, he lent us his wisdom, brains, organs, memory, and many\r\nother good qualities. By this means we are able to contemplate his\r\ncreatures and his laws; by this means we can learn and can speak of\r\nthem always, and only for our own benefit. If Wr-alda had given us\r\nno organs, we should have known nothing, and been more irrational\r\nthan a piece of sea-weed driven up and down by the ebb and flood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS WRITTEN ON PARCHMENT--\"SKRIVFILT.\" SPEECH AND ANSWER TO OTHER\r\nMAIDENS AS AN EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unsociable, avaricious man came to complain to Troost, who was the\r\nmaid of Stavia. He said a thunderstorm had destroyed his house. He\r\nhad prayed to Wr-alda, but Wr-alda had given him no help. Are you\r\na true Frisian? Troost asked. From father and forefathers, replied\r\nthe man. Then she said, I will sow something in your conscience,\r\nin confidence that it will take root, grow, and bear fruit. She\r\ncontinued, When Frya was born, our mother stood naked and bare,\r\nunprotected from the rays of the sun. She could ask no one, and\r\nthere was no one who could give her any help. Then Wr-alda wrought\r\nin her conscience inclination and love, anxiety and fright. She\r\nlooked round her, and her inclination chose the best. She sought a\r\nhiding-place under the sheltering lime-trees, but the rain came, and\r\nthe difficulty was that she got wet. She had seen how the water ran\r\ndown the pendent leaves; so she made a roof of leaves fastened with\r\nsticks, but the wind blew the rain under it. She observed that the\r\nstem would afford protection. She then built a wall of sods, first on\r\none side, and then all round. The wind grew stronger and blew away the\r\nroof, but she made no complaint of Wr-alda. She made a roof of rushes,\r\nand put stones upon it. Having found how hard it is to toil alone,\r\nshe showed her children how and why she had done it. They acted and\r\nthought as she did. This is the way in which we became possessed\r\nof houses and porches, a street, and lime-trees to protect us from\r\nthe rays of the sun. At last we have built a citadel, and all the\r\nrest. If your house is not strong enough, then you must try and make\r\nanother. My house was strong enough, he said, but the flood and the\r\nwind destroyed it. Where did your house stand? Troost asked. On the\r\nbank of the Rhine, he answered. Did it not stand on a knoll? Troost\r\nasked. No, said the man; my house stood alone on the bank. I built\r\nit alone, but I could not alone make a hillock. I knew it, Troost\r\nanswered; the maidens told me. All your life you have avoided your\r\nneighbours, fearing that you might have to give or do something for\r\nthem; but one cannot get on in the world in that way, for Wr-alda,\r\nwho is kind, turns away from the niggardly. Fâsta has advised us,\r\nand it is engraved in stone over all our doors. If you are selfish,\r\ndistrustful towards your neighbours, teach your neighbours, help your\r\nneighbours, and they will return the same to you. If this advice is\r\nnot good enough for you, I can give you no better. The man blushed\r\nfor shame, and slunk away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW I WILL WRITE MYSELF, FIRST ABOUT MY CITADEL, AND THEN ABOUT WHAT\r\nI HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy city lies near the north end of the Liudgaarde. The tower has six\r\nsides, and is ninety feet high, flat-roofed, with a small house upon\r\nit out of which they look at the stars. On either side of the tower\r\nis a house three hundred feet long, and twenty-one feet broad, and\r\ntwenty-one feet high, besides the roof, which is round. All this is\r\nbuilt of hard-baked bricks, and outside there is nothing else. The\r\ncitadel is surrounded by a dyke, with a moat thirty-six feet broad\r\nand twenty-one feet deep. If one looks down from the tower, he sees\r\nthe form of the Juul. In the ground among the houses on the south\r\nside all kinds of native and foreign herbs grow, of which the maidens\r\nmust study the qualities. Among the houses on the north side there\r\nare only fields. The three houses on the north are full of corn and\r\nother necessaries; the two houses on the south are for the maidens\r\nto live in and keep school. The most southern house is the dwelling\r\nof the Burgtmaagd. In the tower hangs the lamp. The walls of the\r\ntower are decorated with precious stones. On the south wall the Tex\r\nis inscribed. On the right side of this are the formulæ, and on the\r\nother side the laws; the other things are found upon the three other\r\nsides. Against the dyke, near the house of the Burgtmaagd, stand the\r\noven and the mill, worked by four oxen. Outside the citadel wall is the\r\nplace where the Burgtheeren and the soldiers live. The fortification\r\noutside is an hour long--not a seaman's hour, but an hour of the sun,\r\nof which twenty-four go to a day. Inside it is a plain five feet\r\nbelow the top. On it are three hundred crossbows covered with wood\r\nand leather.\r\n\r\nBesides the houses of the inhabitants, there are along the inside\r\nof the dyke thirty-six refuge-houses for the people who live in the\r\nneighbourhood. The field serves for a camp and for a meadow. On the\r\nsouth side of the outer fortification is the Liudgaarde, enclosed by\r\nthe great wood of lime-trees. Its shape is three-cornered, with the\r\nwidest part outside, so that the sun may shine in it, for there are a\r\ngreat number of foreign trees and flowers brought by the seafarers. All\r\nthe other citadels are the same shape as ours, only not so large;\r\nbut the largest of all is that of Texland. The tower of the Fryaburgt\r\nis so high that it rends the sky, and all the rest is in proportion\r\nto the tower. In our citadel this is the arrangement: Seven young\r\nmaidens attend to the lamp; each watch is three hours. In the rest of\r\ntheir time they do housework, learn, and sleep. When they have watched\r\nfor seven years, they are free; then they may go among the people,\r\nto look after their morals and to give advice. When they have been\r\nthree years maidens, they may sometimes accompany the older ones.\r\n\r\nThe writer must teach the girls to read, to write, and to reckon. The\r\nelders, or \"Greva,\" must teach them justice and duty, morals, botany,\r\nand medicine, history, traditions, and singing, besides all that may be\r\nnecessary for them to give advice. The Burgtmaagd must teach them how\r\nto set to work when they go among the people. Before a Burgtmaagd can\r\ntake office, she must travel through the country a whole year. Three\r\ngrey-headed Burgtheeren and three old maidens must go with her. This\r\nwas the way that I did. My journey was along the Rhine--on this side\r\nup, and on the other side down. The higher I went, the poorer the\r\npeople seemed to be. Everywhere about the Rhine the people dug holes,\r\nand the sand that was got out was poured with water over fleeces to\r\nget the gold, but the girls did not wear golden crowns of it. Formerly\r\nthey were more numerous, but since we lost Schoonland they have gone\r\nup to the mountains. There they dig ore and make iron. Above the Rhine\r\namong the mountains I have seen Marsaten. The Marsaten are people who\r\nlive on the lakes. Their houses are built upon piles, for protection\r\nfrom the wild beasts and wicked people. There are wolves, bears, and\r\nhorrible lions. Then come the Swiss, the nearest to the frontiers of\r\nthe distant Italians, the followers of Kalta and the savage Twiskar,\r\nall greedy for robbery and booty. The Marsaten gain their livelihood\r\nby fishing and hunting. The skins are sewn together by the women,\r\nand prepared with birch bark. The small skins are as soft as a woman's\r\nskin. The Burgtmaagd at Fryasburgt (Freiburg) told us that they were\r\ngood, simple people; but if I had not heard her speak of them first,\r\nI should have thought that they were not Frya's people, they looked\r\nso impudent. Their wool and herbs are bought by the Rhine people, and\r\ntaken to foreign countries by the ship captains. Along the other side\r\nof the Rhine it was just the same as at Lydasburcht (Leiden). There\r\nwas a great river or lake, and upon this lake also there were people\r\nliving upon piles. But they were not Frya's people; they were black\r\nand brown men who had been employed as rowers to bring home the men\r\nwho had been making foreign voyages, and they had to stay there till\r\nthe fleet went back.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to Alderga. At the head of the south harbour lies the\r\nWaraburgt, built of stone, in which all kinds of clothes, weapons,\r\nshells, and horns are kept, which were brought by the sea-people from\r\ndistant lands. A quarter of an hour's distance from there is Alderga,\r\na great river surrounded by houses, sheds, and gardens, all richly\r\ndecorated. In the river lay a great fleet ready, with banners of\r\nall sorts of colours. On Frya's day the shields were hung on board\r\nlikewise. Some shone like the sun. The shields of the sea-king and\r\nthe admiral were bordered with gold. From the river a canal was dug\r\ngoing past the citadel Forana (Vroonen), with a narrow outlet to the\r\nsea. This was the egress of the fleet; the Fly was the ingress. On\r\nboth sides of the river are fine houses built, painted in bright\r\ncolours. The gardens are all surrounded by green hedges. I saw there\r\nwomen wearing felt tunics, as if it were writing felt. [3] Just as at\r\nStaveren, the girls wore golden crowns on their heads, and rings on\r\ntheir arms and ankles. To the south of Forana lies Alkmarum. Alkmarum\r\nis a lake or river in which there is an island. On this island the\r\nblack and brown people must remain, the same as at Lydasburgt. The\r\nBurgtmaagd of Forana told me that the burgtheeren go every day to teach\r\nthem what real freedom is, and how it behoves men to live in order to\r\nobtain the blessing of Wr-alda's spirit. If there was any one who was\r\nwilling to listen and could comprehend, he was kept there till he was\r\nfully taught. That was done in order to instruct the distant people,\r\nand to make friends everywhere. I had been before in the Saxenmarken,\r\nat the Mannagardaforde castle (Munster). There I saw more poverty\r\nthan I could discover wealth here. She answered: So whenever at\r\nthe Saxenmarken a young man courts a young girl, the girls ask: Can\r\nyou keep your house free from the banished Twisklanders? Have you\r\never killed any of them? How many cattle have you already caught,\r\nand how many bear and wolfskins have you brought to market? And\r\nfrom this it comes that the Saxons have left the cultivation of\r\nthe soil to the women, that not one in a hundred can read or write;\r\nfrom this it comes, too, that no one has a motto on his shield, but\r\nonly a misshapen form of some animal that he has killed; and lastly,\r\nfrom this comes also that they are very warlike, but sometimes as\r\nstupid as the beasts that they catch, and as poor as the Twisklanders\r\nwith whom they go to war. The earth and the sea were made for Frya's\r\npeople. All our rivers run into the sea. The Lydas people and the\r\nFindas people will exterminate each other, and we must people the\r\nempty countries. In movement and sailing is our prosperity. If you\r\nwish the highlanders to share our riches and wisdom, I will give\r\nyou a piece of advice. Let the girls, when they are asked to marry,\r\nbefore they say yes, ask their lovers: What parts of the world have\r\nyou travelled in? What can you tell your children about distant lands\r\nand distant people? If they do this, then the young warriors will\r\ncome to us; they will become wiser and richer, and we shall have no\r\noccasion to deal with those nasty people. The youngest of the maids\r\nwho were with me came from the Saxenmarken. When we came back she\r\nasked leave to go home. Afterwards she became Burgtmaagd there, and\r\nthat is the reason why in these days so many of our sailors are Saxons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        END OF APOLLONIA'S BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF FRÊTHORIK AND WILJOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Frêthorik, surnamed oera Linda, which means over the\r\nLinden. In Ljudwardia I was chosen as Asga. Ljudwardia is a new\r\nvillage within the fortification of the Ljudgaarda, of which the\r\nname has fallen into disrepute. In my time much has happened. I had\r\nwritten a good deal about it, but afterwards much more was related to\r\nme. I will write an account of both one and the other after this book,\r\nto the honour of the good people and to the disgrace of the bad.\r\n\r\nIn my youth I heard complaints on all sides. The bad time was coming;\r\nthe bad time did come--Frya had forsaken us. She withheld from us all\r\nher watch-maidens, because monstrous idolatrous images had been found\r\nwithin our landmarks. I burnt with curiosity to see those images. In\r\nour neighbourhood a little old woman tottered in and out of the houses,\r\nalways calling out about the bad times. I came to her; she stroked\r\nmy chin; then I became bold, and asked her if she would show me the\r\nbad times and the images. She laughed good-naturedly, and took me\r\nto the citadel. An old man asked me if I could read and write. No,\r\nI said. Then you must first go and learn, he replied, otherwise it\r\nmay not be shown to you. I went daily to the writer and learnt. Eight\r\nyears afterwards I heard that our Burgtmaagd had been unchaste, and\r\nthat some of the burgtheeren had committed treason with the Magy, and\r\nmany people took their part. Everywhere disputes arose. There were\r\nchildren rebelling against their parents; good people were secretly\r\nmurdered. The little old woman who had brought everything to light\r\nwas found dead in a ditch. My father, who was a judge, would have\r\nher avenged. He was murdered in the night in his own house. Three\r\nyears after that the Magy was master without any resistance. The\r\nSaxmen had remained religious and upright. All the good people fled\r\nto them. My mother died of it. Now I did like the others. The Magy\r\nprided himself upon his cunning, but Irtha made him know that she\r\nwould not tolerate any Magy or idol on the holy bosom that had borne\r\nFrya. As a wild horse tosses his mane after he has thrown his rider,\r\nso Irtha shook her forests and her mountains. Rivers flowed over the\r\nland; the sea raged; mountains spouted fire to the clouds, and what\r\nthey vomited forth the clouds flung upon the earth. At the beginning\r\nof the Arnemaand (harvest month) the earth bowed towards the north,\r\nand sank down lower and lower. In the Welvenmaand (winter month)\r\nthe low lands of Fryasland were buried under the sea. The woods in\r\nwhich the images were, were torn up and scattered by the wind. The\r\nfollowing year the frost came in the Hardemaand (Louwmaand, January),\r\nand laid Fryasland concealed under a sheet of ice. In Sellemaand\r\n(Sprokkelmaand, February) there were storms of wind from the north,\r\ndriving mountains of ice and stones. When the spring-tides came the\r\nearth raised herself up, the ice melted; with the ebb the forests\r\nwith the images drifted out to sea. In the Winne, or Minnemaand\r\n(Bloeimaand, May), every one who dared went home. I came with a maiden\r\nto the citadel Liudgaarde. How sad it looked there. The forests of\r\nthe Lindaoorden were almost all gone. Where Liudgaarde used to be was\r\nsea. The waves swept over the fortifications. Ice had destroyed the\r\ntower, and the houses lay heaped over each other. On the slope of the\r\ndyke I found a stone on which the writer had inscribed his name. That\r\nwas a sign to me. The same thing had happened to other citadels as\r\nto ours. In the upper lands they had been destroyed by the earth, in\r\nthe lower lands by the water. Fryasburgt, at Texland, was the only one\r\nfound uninjured, but all the land to the north was sunk under the sea,\r\nand has never been recovered. At the mouth of the Flymeer, as we were\r\ntold, thirty salt swamps were found, consisting of the forest and the\r\nground that had been swept away. At Westflyland there were fifty. The\r\ncanal which had run across the land from Alderga was filled up with\r\nsand and destroyed. The seafaring people and other travellers who\r\nwere at home had saved themselves, their goods, and their relations\r\nupon their ships. But the black people at Lydasburgt and Alkmarum\r\nhad done the same; and as they went south they saved many girls, and\r\nas no one came to claim them, they took them for their wives. The\r\npeople who came back all lived within the lines of the citadel, as\r\noutside there was nothing but mud and marsh. The old houses were all\r\nsmashed together. People bought cattle and sheep from the upper lands,\r\nand in the great houses where formerly the maidens were established\r\ncloth and felt were made for a livelihood. This happened 1888 years\r\nafter the submersion of Atland.\r\n\r\nFor 282 years we had not had an Eeremoeder, and now, when everything\r\nseemed lost, they set about choosing one. The lot fell upon Gosa,\r\nsurnamed Makonta. She was Burgtmaagd at Fryasburgt, in Texland. She\r\nhad a clear head and strong sense, and was very good; and as her\r\ncitadel was the only one that had been spared, every one saw in that\r\nher call. Ten years after that the seafarers came from Forana and\r\nLydasburgt. They wished to drive the black men, with their wives and\r\nchildren, out of the country. They wished to obtain the opinion of\r\nthe mother upon the subject. She asked them: Can you send them all\r\nback to their country? If so, then lose no time, or they will find\r\nno relatives alive. No, they said. Gosa replied: They have eaten\r\nyour bread and salt; they have placed themselves entirely under\r\nyour protection. You must consult your own hearts. But I will give\r\nyou one piece of advice. Keep them till you are able to send them\r\nback, but keep them outside your citadels. Watch over their morals,\r\nand educate them as if they were Frya's sons. Their women are the\r\nstrongest here. Their blood will disappear like smoke, till at last\r\nnothing but Frya's blood will remain in their descendants. So they\r\nremained here. Now, I should wish that my descendants should observe\r\nin how far Gosa spoke the truth. When our country began to recover,\r\nthere came troops of poor Saxon men and women to the neighbourhoods\r\nof Staveren and Alderga, to search for gold and other treasures in\r\nthe swampy lands. But the sea-people would not permit it, so they\r\nwent and settled in the empty village of the West Flyland in order\r\nto preserve their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW I WILL RELATE HOW THE GEERTMAN AND MANY FOLLOWERS OF HELLENIA\r\nCAME BACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years after Gosa had become the mother (303 B.C.) there\r\narrived a fleet at Flymeer. The people shouted \"Ho-n-sêen\" (What a\r\nblessing). They sailed to Staveren, where they shouted again. Their\r\nflags were hoisted, and at night they shot lighted arrows into the\r\nair. At daylight some of them rowed into the harbour in a boat,\r\nshouting again, \"Ho-n-sêen.\" When they landed a young fellow jumped\r\nupon the rampart. In his hand he held a shield on which bread and salt\r\nwere laid. After him came a grey-headed man, who said we come from\r\nthe distant Greek land to preserve our customs. Now we wish you to\r\nbe kind enough to give us as much land as will enable us to live. He\r\ntold a long story, which I will hereafter relate more fully. The old\r\nman did not know what to do. They sent messengers all round, also to\r\nme. I went, and said now that we have a mother it behoves us to ask\r\nher advice. I went with them myself. The mother, who already knew\r\nit all, said: Let them come, they will help us to keep our lands,\r\nbut do not let them remain in one place, that they may not become\r\ntoo powerful over us. We did as she said, which was quite to their\r\nliking. Fryso remained with his people at Staveren, which they made\r\nagain into a port as well as they could. Wichhirte went with his people\r\neastwards to the Emude. Some of the descendants of Jon who imagined\r\nthat they sprang from the Alderga people went there. A small number,\r\nwho fancied that their forefathers had come from the seven islands,\r\nwent there and set themselves down within the enclosure of the citadel\r\nof Walhallagara. Liudgert, the admiral of Wichhirt, was my comrade,\r\nand afterwards my friend. Out of his diary I have taken the following\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been settled 12 times 100 and twice 12 years in the Five\r\nWaters (Punjab), whilst our naval warriors were navigating all the\r\nseas they could find, came Alexander the King, with a powerful army\r\ndescending the river towards our villages. No one could withstand him;\r\nbut we sea-people, who lived by the sea, put all our possessions on\r\nboard ships and took our departure. When Alexander heard that such\r\na large fleet had escaped him, he became furious, and swore that\r\nhe would burn all the villages if we did not come back. Wichhirte\r\nwas ill in bed. When Alexander heard that, he waited till he was\r\nbetter. After that he came to him, speaking very kindly--but he\r\ndeceived, as he had done before. Wichhirte answered: Oh greatest of\r\nkings, we sailors go everywhere; we have heard of your great deeds,\r\ntherefore we are full of respect for your arms, and still more for\r\nyour wisdom; but we who are free-born Fryas children, we may not\r\nbecome your slaves; and even if I would, the others would sooner\r\ndie, for so it is commanded in our laws. Alexander said: I do not\r\ndesire to take your land or make slaves of your people, I only wish\r\nto hire your services. That I will swear by both our Gods, so that\r\nno one may be dissatisfied. When Alexander shared bread and salt\r\nwith him, Wichhirte had chosen the wisest part. He let his son fetch\r\nthe ships. When they were all come back Alexander hired them all. By\r\nmeans of them he wished to transport his people to the holy Ganges,\r\nwhich he had not been able to reach. Then he chose among all his\r\npeople and soldiers those who were accustomed to the sea. Wichhirte\r\nhad fallen sick again, therefore I went alone with Nearchus, sent by\r\nthe king. The voyage came to an end without any advantage, because the\r\nJoniers and the Phoenicians were always quarrelling, so that Nearchus\r\nhimself could not keep them in order. In the meantime, the king had\r\nnot sat still. He had let his soldiers cut down trees and make planks,\r\nwith which, with the help of our carpenters, he had built ships. Now he\r\nwould himself become a sea-king, and sail with his whole army up the\r\nGanges; but the soldiers who came from the mountainous countries were\r\nafraid of the sea. When they heard that they must sail, they set fire\r\nto the timber yards, and so our whole village was laid in ashes. At\r\nfirst we thought that this had been done by Alexander's orders, and\r\nwe were all ready to cast ourselves into the sea: but Alexander was\r\nfurious, and wished his own people to kill the soldiers. However,\r\nNearchus, who was not only his chief officer, but also his friend,\r\nadvised him not to do so. So he pretended to believe that it had\r\nhappened by accident, and said no more about it. He wished now\r\nto return, but before going he made an inquiry who really were the\r\nguilty ones. As soon as he ascertained it, he had them all disarmed,\r\nand made them build a new village. His own people he kept under arms to\r\noverawe the others, and to build a citadel. We were to take the women\r\nand children with us. When we arrived at the mouth of the Euphrates,\r\nwe might either choose a place to settle there or come back. Our pay\r\nwould be guaranteed to us the same in either case. Upon the new ships\r\nwhich had been saved from the fire he embarked the Joniers and the\r\nGreeks. He himself went with the rest of his people along the coast,\r\nthrough the barren wilderness; that is, through the land that Irtha\r\nhad heaved up out of the sea when she had raised up the strait as\r\nsoon as our forefathers had passed into the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at New Gertmania (New Gertmania is the port that\r\nwe had made in order to take in water), we met Alexander with his\r\narmy. Nearchus went ashore, and stayed three days. Then we proceeded\r\nfurther on. When we came to the Euphrates, Nearchus went ashore\r\nwith the soldiers and a large body of people; but he soon returned,\r\nand said, The King requests you, for his sake, to go a voyage up\r\nthe Red Sea; after that each shall receive as much gold as he can\r\ncarry. When we arrived there, he showed us where the strait had\r\nformerly been. There he spent thirty-one days, always looking steadily\r\ntowards the desert.\r\n\r\nAt last there arrived a great troop of people, bringing with them 200\r\nelephants, 1000 camels, a quantity of timber, ropes, and all kinds of\r\nimplements necessary to drag our fleet to the Mediterranean Sea. This\r\nastounded us, and seemed most extraordinary; but Nearchus told us that\r\nhis king wished to show to the other kings that he was more powerful\r\nthan any kings of Tyre had ever been. We were only to assist, and that\r\nsurely could do us no harm. We were obliged to yield, and Nearchus\r\nknew so well how to regulate everything, that before three months\r\nhad elapsed our ships lay in the Mediterranean Sea. When Alexander\r\nascertained how his project had succeeded, he became so audacious\r\nthat he wished to dig out the dried-up strait in defiance of Irtha;\r\nbut Wr-alda deserted his soul, so that he destroyed himself by wine\r\nand rashness before he could begin it. After his death his kingdom\r\nwas divided among his princes. They were each to have preserved a\r\nshare for his sons, but that was not their intention. Each wished\r\nto keep his own share, and to get more. Then war arose, and we could\r\nnot return. Nearchus wished us to settle on the coast of Phoenicia,\r\nbut that no one would do. We said we would rather risk the attempt to\r\nreturn to Fryasland. Then he brought us to the new port of Athens,\r\nwhere all the true children of Frya had formerly gone. We went,\r\nsoldiers with our goods and weapons. Among the many princes Nearchus\r\nhad a friend named Antigonus. These two had only one object in view,\r\nas they told us--to help the royal race, and to restore freedom to\r\nall the Greek lands. Antigonus had, among many others, one son named\r\nDemetrius, afterwards called the \"City Winner.\" He went once to the\r\ntown of Salamis, and after he had been some time fighting there, he\r\nhad an engagement with the fleet of Ptolemy. Ptolemy was the name of\r\nthe prince who reigned over Egypt. Demetrius won the battle, not by\r\nhis own soldiers, but because we helped him. We had done this out\r\nof friendship for Nearchus, because we knew that he was of bastard\r\nbirth by his white skin, blue eyes, and fair hair. Afterwards,\r\nDemetrius attacked Rhodes, and we transported thither his soldiers\r\nand provisions. When we made our last voyage to Rhodes, the war\r\nwas finished. Demetrius had sailed to Athens. When we came into the\r\nharbour, the whole village was in deep mourning. Friso, who was king\r\nover the fleet, had a son and a daughter so remarkably fair, as if\r\nthey had just come out of Fryasland, and more beautiful than any one\r\ncould picture to himself. The fame of this went all over Greece, and\r\ncame to the ears of Demetrius. Demetrius was vile and immoral, and\r\nthought he could do as he pleased. He carried off the daughter. The\r\nmother did not dare await the return of her joi (the sailors wives\r\ncall their husbands joi or zoethart (sweetheart). The men call their\r\nwives troost (comfort) and fro or frow, that is, vreuyde (delight)\r\nand frolic; that is the same as vreugde.)\r\n\r\nAs she dared not wait for her husband's return, she went with her\r\nson to Demetrius, and implored him to send back her daughter; but\r\nwhen Demetrius saw the son he had him taken to his palace, and did\r\nto him as he had done to his sister. He sent a bag of gold to the\r\nmother, which she flung into the sea. When she came home she was out\r\nof her mind, and ran about the streets calling out: Have you seen my\r\nchildren. Woe is me! let me find a place to hide in, for my husband\r\nwill kill me because I have lost his children.\r\n\r\nWhen Demetrius heard that Friso had come home, he sent messengers\r\nto him to say that he had taken his children to raise them to high\r\nrank, and to reward him for his services. But Friso was proud and\r\npassionate, and sent a messenger with a letter to his children, in\r\nwhich he recommended them to accept the will of Demetrius, as he\r\nwished to promote their happiness; but the messenger had another\r\nletter with poison, which he ordered them to take: But, said he,\r\nyour bodies have been defiled against your will. That you are not to\r\nblame for; but if your souls are not pure, you will never come into\r\nWalhalla. Your spirits will haunt the earth in darkness. Like the bats\r\nand owls, you will hide yourselves in the daytime in holes, and in\r\nthe night will come and shriek and cry about our graves, while Frya\r\nmust turn her head away from you. The children did as their father\r\nhad commanded. The messenger had their bodies thrown into the sea,\r\nand it was reported that they had fled. Now Friso wished to go with\r\nall his people to Frya's land, where he had been formerly, but most of\r\nthem would not go. So Friso set fire to the village and all the royal\r\nstorehouses; then no one could remain there, and all were glad to be\r\nout of it. We left everything behind us except wives and children,\r\nbut we had an ample stock of provisions and warlike implements.\r\n\r\nFriso was not yet satisfied. When we came to the old harbour, he went\r\noff with his stout soldiers and threw fire into all the ships that\r\nhe could reach with his arrows. Six days later we saw the war-fleet\r\nof Demetrius coming down upon us. Friso ordered us to keep back the\r\nsmall ships in a broad line, and to put the large ships with the women\r\nand children in front. Further, he ordered us to take the crossbows\r\nthat were in the fore part and fix them on the sterns of the ships,\r\nbecause, said he, we must fight a retreating battle. No man must\r\npresume to pursue a single enemy--that is my order. While we were\r\nbusy about this, all at once the wind came ahead, to the great alarm\r\nof the cowards and the women, because we had no slaves except those\r\nwho had voluntarily followed us. Therefore we could not escape the\r\nenemy by rowing. But Wr-alda knew well why he did this; and Friso,\r\nwho understood it, immediately had the fire-arrows placed on the\r\ncrossbows. At the same time he gave the order that no one should shoot\r\nbefore he did, and that we should all aim at the centre ship. If we\r\nsucceeded in this, he said, the others would all go to its assistance,\r\nand then everybody might shoot as he best was able. When we were at\r\na cable and a half distance from them the Phoenicians began to shoot,\r\nbut Friso did not reply till the first arrow fell six fathoms from his\r\nship. Then he fired, and the rest followed. It was like a shower of\r\nfire; and as our arrows went with the wind, they all remained alight\r\nand reached the third line. Everybody shouted and cheered, but the\r\nscreams of our opponents were so loud that our hearts shrank. When\r\nFriso thought that it was sufficient he called us off, and we sped\r\naway; but after two days' slow sailing another fleet of thirty ships\r\ncame in sight and gained upon us. Friso cleared for action again,\r\nbut the others sent forward a small rowing-boat with messengers,\r\nwho asked permission to sail with us, as they were Joniers. They\r\nhad been compelled by Demetrius to go to the old haven; there they\r\nhad heard of the battle, and girding on their stout swords, had\r\nfollowed us. Friso, who had sailed a good deal with the Joniers,\r\nsaid Yes; but Wichirte, our king, said No. The Joniers, said he,\r\nare worshippers of heathen gods; I myself have heard them call upon\r\nthem. That comes from their intercourse with the real Greeks, Friso\r\nsaid. I have often done it myself, and yet I am as pious a Fryas man\r\nas any of you. Friso was the man to take us to Friesland, therefore\r\nthe Joniers went with us. It seems that this was pleasing to Wr-alda,\r\nfor before three months were past we coasted along Britain, and three\r\ndays later we could shout huzza.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS WRITING HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME ABOUT NORTHLAND AND SCHOONLAND\r\n(SCANDINAVIA).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen our land was submerged I was in Schoonland. It was very bad\r\nthere. There were great lakes which rose from the earth like bubbles,\r\nthen burst asunder, and from the rents flowed a stuff like red-hot\r\niron. The tops of high mountains fell and destroyed whole forests\r\nand villages. I myself saw one mountain torn from another and fall\r\nstraight down. When I afterwards went to see the place there was\r\na lake there. When the earth was composed there came a duke of\r\nLindasburgt with his people, and one maiden who cried everywhere,\r\nMagy is the cause of all the misery that we have suffered. They\r\ncontinued their progress, and their hosts increased. The Magy fled,\r\nand his corpse was found where he had killed himself. Then the Finns\r\nwere driven to one place where they might live. There were some of\r\nmixed blood who were allowed to stay, but most of them went with the\r\nFinns. The duke was chosen as king. The temples which had remained\r\nwhole were destroyed. Since that time the good Northmen come often to\r\nTexland for the advice of the mother; still we cannot consider them\r\nreal Frisians. In Denmark it has certainly happened as with us. The\r\nsea-people, who call themselves famous sea-warriors, went on board\r\ntheir ships, and afterwards went back again.\r\n\r\n                                 Hail!\r\n\r\nWhenever the Carrier has completed a period, then posterity shall\r\nunderstand that the faults and misdeeds that the Brokmannen have\r\nbrought with them belonged to their forefathers; therefore I will\r\nwatch, and will describe as much of their manners as I have seen. The\r\nGeertmannen I can readily pass by. I have not had much to do with them,\r\nbut as far as I have seen they have mostly retained their language and\r\ncustoms. I cannot say that of the others. Those who descend from the\r\nGreeks speak a bad language, and have not much to boast of in their\r\nmanners. Many have brown eyes and hair. They are envious and impudent,\r\nand cowardly from superstition. When they speak, they put the words\r\nfirst that ought to come last. For old they at; for salt, sât; and for\r\nman, ma--too many to mention. They also use abbreviations of names,\r\nwhich have no meaning. The Joniers speak better, but they drop the\r\nH, and put it where it ought not to be. When they make a statue of\r\na dead person they believe that the spirit of the departed enters\r\ninto it; therefore they have hidden their statues of Frya, Fâsta,\r\nMedea, Thiania, Hellenia, and many others. When a child is born, all\r\nthe relatives come together and pray to Frya to send her servants to\r\nbless the child. When they have prayed, they must neither move nor\r\nspeak. If the child begins to cry, and continues some time, it is a\r\nbad sign, and they suspect that the mother has committed adultery. I\r\nhave seen very bad things come from that. If the child sleeps, that\r\nis a good sign--Frya's servants are come. If it laughs in its sleep,\r\nthe servants have promised it happiness. Moreover, they believe in bad\r\nspirits, witches, sorcerers, dwarfs, and elves, as if they descended\r\nfrom the Finns. Herewith I will finish, and I think I have written\r\nmore than any of my forefathers. Frethorik.\r\n\r\nFrethorik, my husband, lived to the age of 63. Since 108 years he\r\nis the first of his race who died a peaceable death; all the others\r\ndied by violence, because they all fought with their own people,\r\nand with foreigners for right and duty.\r\n\r\nMy name is Wiljo. I am the maiden who came home with him from\r\nSaxsenmarken. In the course of conversation it came out that we\r\nwere both of Adela's race--thus our affection commenced, and we\r\nbecame man and wife. He left me with five children, two sons and\r\nthree daughters. Konreed was my eldest son, Hachgana my second. My\r\neldest daughter is called Adela, my second Frulik, and the youngest\r\nNocht. When I went to Saxsenmarken I preserved three books--the book\r\nof songs, the book of narratives, and the Hellenia book.\r\n\r\nI write this in order that people may not think they were by\r\nApollonia. I have had a good deal of annoyance about this, and\r\ntherefore now wish to have the honour of it. I also did more. When\r\nGosa Makonta died, whose goodness and clear-sightedness have become\r\na proverb, I went alone to Texland to copy the writings that she had\r\nleft; and when the last will of Frana was found, and the writings\r\nleft by Adela or Hellenia, I did that again. These are the writings\r\nof Hellenia. I have put them first because they are the oldest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HAIL TO ALL TRUE FRISIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the olden times, the Slavonic race knew nothing of liberty. They\r\nwere brought under the yoke like oxen. They were driven into the\r\nbowels of the earth to dig metals, and had to build houses of stone as\r\ndwelling-places for princes and priests. Of all that they did nothing\r\ncame to themselves, everything must serve to enrich and make more\r\npowerful the priests and the princes, and to satisfy them. Under this\r\ntreatment they grew gray and old before their time, and died without\r\nany enjoyment; although the earth produces abundantly for the good of\r\nall her children. But our runaways and exiles came through Twiskland\r\nto their boundaries, and our sailors came to their harbours. From\r\nthem they heard of liberty, of justice, and laws, without which\r\nmen cannot exist. This was all absorbed by the unhappy people like\r\ndew into an arid soil. When they fully understood this, the most\r\ncourageous among them began to clank their chains, which grieved the\r\nprinces. The princes are proud and warlike; there is therefore some\r\nvirtue in their hearts. They consulted together and bestowed some of\r\ntheir superfluity; but the cowardly hypocritical priests could not\r\nsuffer this. Among their false gods they had invented also wicked\r\ncruel monsters. Pestilence broke out in the country; and they said\r\nthat the gods were angry with the domineering of the wicked. Then the\r\nboldest of the people were strangled in their chains. The earth drank\r\ntheir blood, and that blood produced corn and fruits that inspired\r\nwith wisdom those who ate them.\r\n\r\nSixteen hundred years ago (she writes, 593 B.C.), Atland was submerged;\r\nand at that time something happened which nobody had reckoned upon. In\r\nthe heart of Findasland, upon a mountain, lies a plain called Kasamyr\r\n(Cashmere) that is \"extraordinary.\" There was a child born whose mother\r\nwas the daughter of a king, and whose father was a high-priest. In\r\norder to hide the shame they were obliged to renounce their own\r\nblood. Therefore it was taken out of the town to poor people. As the\r\nboy grew up, nothing was concealed from him, so he did all in his\r\npower to acquire wisdom. His intellect was so great that he understood\r\neverything that he saw or heard. The people regarded him with respect,\r\nand the priests were afraid of his questions. When he was of full age\r\nhe went to his parents. They had to listen to some hard language;\r\nand to get rid of him they gave him a quantity of jewels, but they\r\ndared not openly acknowledge him. Overcome with sorrow at the false\r\nshame of his parents, he wandered about. While travelling he fell in\r\nwith a Frisian sailor who was serving as a slave, and who taught him\r\nour manners and customs. He bought the freedom of the slave, and they\r\nremained friends till death. Wherever he went he taught the people not\r\nto tolerate rich men or priests, and that they must guard themselves\r\nagainst false shame, which everywhere did harm to love and charity. The\r\nearth, he said, bestowed her treasures on those who scratch her skin;\r\nso all are obliged to dig, and plough, and sow if they wish to reap,\r\nbut no one is obliged to do anything for another unless it be out of\r\ngoodwill. He taught that men should not seek in her bowels for gold,\r\nor silver, or precious stones, which occasion envy and destroy love. To\r\nembellish your wives and daughters, he said, the river offers her pure\r\nstream. No man is able to make everybody equally rich and happy, but\r\nit is the duty of all men to make each other as equally rich and as\r\nhappy as possible. Men should not despise any knowledge; but justice\r\nis the greatest knowledge that time can teach, because she wards off\r\noffences and promotes love.\r\n\r\nHis first name was Jessos, but the priests, who hated him, called him\r\nFo, that is, false; the people called him Krishna, that is, shepherd;\r\nand his Frisian friend called him Buddha (purse), because he had in\r\nhis head a treasure of wisdom, and in his heart a treasure of love.\r\n\r\nAt last he was obliged to flee from the wrath of the priests; but\r\nwherever he went his teaching had preceded him, whilst his enemies\r\nfollowed him like his shadow. When Jessos had thus travelled for\r\ntwelve years he died; but his friends preserved his teaching, and\r\nspread it wherever they found listeners.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think the priests did then? That I must tell you, and\r\nyou must give your best attention to it. Moreover, you must keep\r\nguard against their acts and their tricks with all the strength\r\nthat Wr-alda has given you. While the doctrine of Jessos was thus\r\nspreading over the earth, the false priests went to the land of\r\nhis birth to make his death known. They said they were his friends,\r\nand they pretended to show great sorrow by tearing their clothes and\r\nshaving their heads. They went to live in caves in the mountains, but\r\nin them they had hid all their treasures, and they made in them images\r\nof Jessos. They gave these statues to simple people, and at last they\r\nsaid that Jessos was a god, that he had declared this himself to them,\r\nand that all those who followed his doctrine should enter his kingdom\r\nhereafter, where all was joy and happiness. Because they knew that\r\nhe was opposed to the rich, they announced everywhere that poverty,\r\nsuffering, and humility were the door by which to enter into his\r\nkingdom, and that those who had suffered the most on earth should enjoy\r\nthe greatest happiness there. Although they knew that Jessos had taught\r\nthat men should regulate and control their passions, they taught that\r\nmen should stifle their passions, and that the perfection of humanity\r\nconsisted in being as unfeeling as the cold stones. In order to make\r\nthe people believe that they did as they preached, they pretended to\r\noutward poverty; and that they had overcome all sensual feelings,\r\nthey took no wives. But if any young girl had made a false step,\r\nit was quickly forgiven; the weak, they said, were to be assisted,\r\nand to save their souls men must give largely to the Church. Acting\r\nin this way, they had wives and children without households, and were\r\nrich without working; but the people grew poorer and more miserable\r\nthan they had ever been before. This doctrine, which requires the\r\npriests to possess no further knowledge than to speak deceitfully,\r\nand to pretend to be pious while acting unjustly, spreads from east\r\nto west, and will come to our land also.\r\n\r\nBut when the priests fancy that they have entirely extinguished the\r\nlight of Frya and Jessos, then shall all classes of men rise up who\r\nhave quietly preserved the truth among themselves, and have hidden\r\nit from the priests. They shall be of princely blood of priests,\r\nSlavonic, and Frya's blood. They will make their light visible,\r\nso that all men shall see the truth; they shall cry woe to the acts\r\nof the princes and the priests. The princes who love the truth and\r\njustice shall separate themselves from the priests; blood shall flow,\r\nbut from it the people will gather new strength. Finda's folk shall\r\ncontribute their industry to the common good, Linda's folk their\r\nstrength, and we our wisdom. Then the false priests shall be swept\r\naway from the earth. Wr-alda's spirit shall be invoked everywhere\r\nand always; the laws that Wr-alda in the beginning instilled into\r\nour consciences shall alone be listened to. There shall be neither\r\nprinces, nor masters, nor rulers, except those chosen by the general\r\nvoice. Then Frya shall rejoice, and the earth will only bestow her\r\ngifts on those who work. All this shall begin 4000 years after the\r\nsubmersion of Atland, and 1000 years later there shall exist no longer\r\neither priest or oppression.\r\n\r\nDela, surnamed Hellenia, watch!\r\n\r\nThus runs Frana's last will: All noble Frisians, Heil! In the name of\r\nWr-alda, of Frya, and of Freedom, I greet you; and pray you if I die\r\nbefore I have named a successor, then I recommend to you Teuntja, who\r\nis Burgtmaagd in the citadel of Medeasblik; till now she is the best.\r\n\r\nThis Gosa has left behind her: Hail to all men! I have named no\r\nEeremoeder, because I know none, and because it is better for you to\r\nhave no mother than to have one you cannot trust. One bad time is\r\npassed by, but there is still another coming. Irtha has not given\r\nit birth, and Wr-alda has not decreed it. It comes from the East,\r\nout of the bosom of the priests. It will breed so much mischief that\r\nIrtha will not be able to drink the blood of her slain children. It\r\nwill spread darkness over the minds of men like storm-clouds over the\r\nsunlight. Everywhere craft and deception shall contend with freedom and\r\njustice. Freedom and justice shall be overcome, and we with them. But\r\nthis success will work out its own loss. Our descendants shall teach\r\ntheir people and their slaves the meaning of three words; they are\r\nuniversal love, freedom, and justice. At first they shall shine, then\r\nstruggle with darkness, until every man's head and heart has become\r\nbright and clear. Then shall oppression be driven from the earth,\r\nlike the thunder-clouds by the storm-wind, and all deceit will cease\r\nto have any more power. Gosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITING OF KONERÊD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy forefathers have written this book in succession. I will do this,\r\nthe more because there exists no longer in my state any citadel on\r\nwhich events are inscribed as used to be the case. My name is Konerêd\r\n(Koenraad). My father's name was Frethorik, my mother's name was\r\nWiljow. After my father's death I was chosen as his successor. When\r\nI was fifty years old I was chosen for chief Grevetman. My father has\r\nwritten how the Lindaoorden and Liudgaarden were destroyed. Lindahem is\r\nstill lost, the Lindaoorden partially, and the north Lindgaarden are\r\nstill concealed by the salt sea. The foaming sea washes the ramparts\r\nof the castle. As my father has mentioned, the people, being deprived\r\nof their harbour, went away and built houses inside the ramparts of\r\nthe citadel; therefore that bastion is called Lindwerd. The sea-people\r\nsay Linwerd, but that is nonsense. In my youth there was a portion of\r\nland lying outside the rampart all mud and marsh; but Frya's people\r\nwere neither tired nor exhausted when they had a good object in\r\nview. By digging ditches, and making dams of the earth that came out\r\nof the ditches, we recovered a good space of land outside the rampart,\r\nwhich had the form of a hoof three poles eastward, three southwards,\r\nand three westwards. At present we are engaged in ramming piles into\r\nthe ground to make a harbour to protect our rampart. When the work\r\nis finished we shall attract mariners. In my youth it looked very\r\nqueer, but now there stands a row of houses. Leaks and deficiencies\r\nproduced by poverty have been remedied by industry. From this men may\r\nlearn that Wr-alda, our universal father, protects all his creatures,\r\nif they preserve their courage and help each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW I WILL WRITE ABOUT FRISO.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriso, who was already powerful by his troops, was chosen chief\r\nGrevetman of the districts round Staveren. He laughed at our mode\r\nof defending our land and our sea-fights; therefore he established a\r\nschool where the boys might learn to fight in the Greek manner, but\r\nI believe that he did it to attach the young people to himself. I\r\nsent my brother there ten years ago, because I thought, now that\r\nwe have not got any mother, it behoves me to be doubly watchful,\r\nin order that he may not become our master.\r\n\r\nGosa has given us no successors. I will not give any opinion about\r\nthat; but there are still old suspicious people who think that\r\nshe and Friso had an understanding about it. When Gosa died, the\r\npeople from all parts wished to choose another mother; but Friso,\r\nwho was busy establishing a kingdom for himself, did not desire to\r\nhave any advice or messenger from Texland. When the messengers of\r\nthe Landsaten came to him, he said that Gosa had been far-seeing and\r\nwiser than all the counts together, and yet she had been unable to\r\nsee any light or way out of this affair; therefore she had not had\r\nthe courage to choose a successor, and to choose a doubtful one she\r\nthought would be very bad; therefore she wrote in her last will,\r\nIt is better to have no mother than to have one on whom you cannot\r\nrely. Friso had seen a great deal. He had been brought up in the wars,\r\nand he had just learned and gathered as much of the tricks and cunning\r\nways of the Gauls and the princes as he required, to lead the other\r\ncounts wherever he wished. See here how he went to work about that.\r\n\r\nFriso had taken here another wife, a daughter of Wilfrêthe, who in\r\nhis lifetime had been chief count of Staveren. By her he had two sons\r\nand two daughters. By his wish Kornelia, his youngest daughter, was\r\nmarried to my brother. Kornelia is not good Frisian; her name ought\r\nto be written Korn-helia. Weemoed, his eldest daughter, he married\r\nto Kauch. Kauch, who went to school to him, is the son of Wichhirte,\r\nthe king of the Geertmen. But Kauch is likewise not good Frisian,\r\nand ought to be Kaap (Koop). So they have learned more bad language\r\nthan good manners.\r\n\r\nNow I must return to my story.\r\n\r\nAfter the great flood of which my father wrote an account, there came\r\nmany Jutlanders and Letlanders out of the Baltic, or bad sea. They\r\nwere driven down the Kattegat in their boats by the ice as far as the\r\ncoast of Denmark, and there they remained. There was not a creature\r\nto be seen; so they took possession of the land, and named it after\r\nthemselves, Jutland. Afterwards many of the Denmarkers returned from\r\nthe higher lands, but they settled more to the south; and when the\r\nmariners returned who had not been lost, they all went together to\r\nZeeland. By this arrangement the Jutlanders retained the land to\r\nwhich Wr-alda had conducted them. The Zeeland skippers, who were\r\nnot satisfied to live upon fish, and who hated the Gauls, took to\r\nrobbing the Phoenician ships. In the south-west point of Scandinavia\r\nthere lies Lindasburgt, called Lindasnôse, built by one Apol, as is\r\nwritten in the book. All the people who live on the coasts, and in\r\nthe neighbouring districts, had remained true Frisians; but by their\r\ndesire for vengeance upon the Gauls, and the followers of Kaltona,\r\nthey joined the Zeelanders. But that connection did not hold together,\r\nbecause the Zeelanders had adopted many evil manners and customs\r\nof the wicked Magyars, in opposition to Frya's people. Afterwards,\r\neverybody went stealing on his own account; but when it suited them\r\nthey held all together. At last the Zeelanders began to be in want\r\nof good ships. Their shipbuilders had died, and their forests as\r\nwell as their land had been washed out to sea. Now there arrived\r\nunexpectedly three ships, which anchored off the ringdyk of our\r\ncitadel. By the disruption of our land they had lost themselves,\r\nand had missed Flymond. The merchant who was with them wished to\r\nbuy new ships from us, and for that purpose had brought all kinds of\r\nvaluables, which they had stolen from the Celtic country and Phoenician\r\nships. As we had no ships, I gave them active horses and four armed\r\ncouriers to Friso; because at Stavere, along the Alberga, the best\r\nships of war were built of hard oak which never rots. While these\r\nsea rovers remained with us, some of the Jutmen had gone to Texland,\r\nand thence to Friso. The Zeelanders had stolen many of their strongest\r\nboys to row their ships, and many of their finest daughters to have\r\nchildren by. The great Jutlanders could not prevent it, as they were\r\nnot properly armed. When they had related all their misfortunes,\r\nand a good deal of conversation had taken place, Friso asked them\r\nat last if they had no good harbours in their country. Oh, yes, they\r\nanswered; a beautiful one, created by Wr-alda. It is like a bottle,\r\nthe neck narrow, but in the belly a thousand large boats may lie; but\r\nwe have no citadel and no defences to keep out the pirate ships. Then\r\nyou should make them, said Friso. That is very good advice, said\r\nthe Jutlanders; but we have no workmen and no building materials;\r\nwe are all fishermen and trawlers. The others are drowned or fled to\r\nthe higher lands. While they were talking in this way, my messengers\r\narrived at the court with the Zeeland gentlemen. Here you must\r\nobserve how Friso understood deceiving everybody, to the satisfaction\r\nof both parties, and to the accomplishment of his own ends. To the\r\nZeelanders he promised that they should have yearly fifty ships of a\r\nfixed size for a fixed price, fitted with iron chains and crossbows,\r\nand full rigging as is necessary and useful for men-of-war, but that\r\nthey should leave in peace the Jutlanders and all the people of Frya's\r\nrace. But he wished to do more; he wanted to engage all our sea rovers\r\nto go with him upon his fighting expedition. When the Zeelanders\r\nhad gone, he loaded forty old ships with weapons for wall defences,\r\nwood, bricks, carpenters, masons, and smiths, in order to build\r\ncitadels. Witto, or Witte, his son, he sent to superintend. I have\r\nnever been well informed of what happened; but this much is clear to\r\nme, that on each side of the harbour a strong citadel has been built,\r\nand garrisoned by people brought by Friso out of Saksenmarken. Witto\r\ncourted Siuchthirte and married her. Wilhem, her father, was chief\r\nAlderman of the Jutmen--that is, chief Grevetman or Count. Wilhem\r\ndied shortly afterwards, and Witto was chosen in his place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT FRISO DID FURTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf his first wife he still had two brothers-in-law, who were very\r\ndaring. Hetto--that is, heat--the youngest, he sent as messenger to\r\nKattaburgt, which lies far in the Saxsenmarken. Friso gave him to take\r\nseven horses, besides his own, laden with precious things stolen by\r\nthe sea-rovers. With each horse there were two young sea-rovers and\r\ntwo young horsemen, clad in rich garments, and with money in their\r\npurses. In the same way as he sent Hetto to Kattaburgt, he sent\r\nBruno--that is, brown--the other brother-in-law, to Mannagarda oord,\r\nMannagarda oord was written Mannagarda ford in the earlier part of\r\nthis book, but that is wrong. All the riches that they took with them\r\nwere given away, according to circumstances, to princes, princesses,\r\nand chosen young girls. When his young men went to the tavern to\r\ndance with the young people there, they ordered baskets of spice,\r\ngingerbread, and tuns of the best beer. After these messengers he let\r\nhis young people constantly go over to the Saxsenmarken, always with\r\nmoney in their purses and presents to give away, and they spent money\r\ncarelessly in the taverns. When the Saxsen youths looked with envy\r\nat this they smiled, and said, If you dare go and fight the common\r\nenemy you would be able to give much richer presents to your brides,\r\nand live much more princely. Both the brothers-in-law of Friso had\r\nmarried daughters of the chief princes, and afterwards the Saxsen\r\nyouths and girls came in whole troops to the Flymeer.\r\n\r\nThe burgtmaidens and old maidens who still remembered their greatness\r\ndid not hold with Friso's object, and therefore they said no good\r\nof him; but Friso, more cunning than they, let them chatter, but\r\nthe younger maidens he led to his side with golden fingers. They\r\nsaid everywhere, For a long time we have had no mother, but that\r\ncomes from our being fit to take care of ourselves. At present it\r\nsuits us best to have a king to win back our lands that we have lost\r\nthrough the imprudence of our mothers. Further they said, Every child\r\nof Frya has permission to let his voice be heard before the choice\r\nof a prince is decided; but if it comes to that, that you choose\r\na king, then also we will have our say. From all that we can see,\r\nWr-alda has appointed Friso for it, for he has brought him here in a\r\nwonderful way. Friso knows the tricks of the Gauls, whose language he\r\nspeaks; he can therefore watch against their craftiness. Then there\r\nis something else to keep the eye upon. What count could be chosen\r\nas king without the others being jealous of him? All such nonsense\r\nthe young maidens talked; but the old maidens, though few in number,\r\ntapped their advice out of another cask. They said always and to every\r\none: Friso does like the spiders. At night he spreads his webs in all\r\ndirections, and in the day he catches in them all his unsuspecting\r\nfriends. Friso says he cannot suffer any priests or foreign princes,\r\nbut we say that he cannot suffer anybody but himself; therefore he\r\nwill not allow the citadel of Stavia to be rebuilt; therefore he\r\nwill not have the mother again. To-day Friso is your counsellor,\r\nto-morrow he will be your king, in order to have full power over\r\nyou. Among the people there now existed two parties. The old and the\r\npoor wished to have the mother again, but the young and the warlike\r\nwished for a father and a king. The first called themselves mother's\r\nsons, the others father's sons, but the mother's sons did not count\r\nfor much; because there were many ships to build, there was a good\r\ntime for all kinds of workmen. Moreover, the sea-rovers brought all\r\nsorts of treasures, with which the maidens were pleased, the girls\r\nwere pleased, and their relations and friends.\r\n\r\nWhen Friso had been nearly forty years at Staveren he died. Owing to\r\nhim many of the states had been joined together again, but that we\r\nwere the better for it I am not prepared to certify. Of all the counts\r\nthat preceded him there was none so renowned as Friso; for, as I said\r\nbefore, the young maidens spoke in his praise, while the old maidens\r\ndid all in their power to make him hateful to everybody. Although the\r\nold women could not prevent his meddling, they made so much fuss that\r\nhe died without becoming king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW I WILL WRITE ABOUT HIS SON ADEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriso, who had learned our history from the book of the Adelingen,\r\nhad done everything in his power to win their friendship. His eldest\r\nson, whom he had by his wife Swethirte, he named Adel; and although\r\nhe strove with all his might to prevent the building or restoring\r\nany citadels, he sent Adel to the citadel of Texland in order to make\r\nhimself better acquainted with our laws, language, and customs. When\r\nAdel was twenty years old Friso brought him into his own school,\r\nand when he had fully educated him he sent him to travel through\r\nall the states. Adel was an amiable young man, and in his travels\r\nhe made many friends, so the people called him Atharik--that is,\r\nrich in friends--which was very useful to him afterwards, for when\r\nhis father died he took his place without a question of any other\r\ncount being chosen.\r\n\r\nWhile Adel was studying at Texland there was a lovely maiden at the\r\ncitadel. She came from Saxenmarken, from the state of Suobaland,\r\ntherefore she was called at Texland Suobene, although her name was\r\nIfkja. Adel fell in love with her, and she with him, but his father\r\nwished him to wait a little. Adel did as he wished; but as soon as\r\nhe was dead, sent messengers to Berthold, her father, to ask her in\r\nmarriage. Berthold was a prince of high-principled feelings. He had\r\nsent his daughter to Texland in the hope that she might be chosen\r\nBurgtmaagd in her country, but when he knew of their mutual affection\r\nhe bestowed his blessing upon them. Ifkja was a clever Frisian. As\r\nfar as I have been able to learn, she always toiled and worked to\r\nbring the Frya's people back under the same laws and customs. To\r\nbring the people to her side, she travelled with her husband through\r\nall Saxenmarken, and also to Geertmannia--as the Geertmen had named\r\nthe country which they had obtained by means of Gosa. Thence they\r\nwent to Denmark, and from Denmark by sea to Texland. From Texland\r\nthey went to Westflyland, and so along the coast to Walhallagara;\r\nthence they followed the Zuiderryn (the Waal), till, with great\r\napprehension, they arrived beyond the Rhine at the Marsaten of whom\r\nour Apollonia has written. When they had stayed there a little time,\r\nthey returned to the lowlands. When they had been some time descending\r\ntowards the lowlands, and had reached about the old citadel of Aken,\r\nfour of their servants were suddenly murdered and stripped. They had\r\nloitered a little behind. My brother, who was always on the alert,\r\nhad forbidden them to do so, but they did not listen to him. The\r\nmurderers that had committed this crime were Twisklanders, who had at\r\nthat time audaciously crossed the Rhine to murder and to steal. The\r\nTwisklanders are banished and fugitive children of Frya, but their\r\nwives they have stolen from the Tartars. The Tartars are a brown\r\ntribe of Finda's people, who are thus named because they make war on\r\neverybody. They are all horsemen and robbers. This is what makes the\r\nTwisklanders so bloodthirsty. The Twisklanders who had done the wicked\r\ndeed called themselves Frijen or Franken. There were among them,\r\nmy brother said, red, brown, and white men. The red and brown made\r\ntheir hair white with lime-water--but as their faces remained brown,\r\nthey were only the more ugly. In the same way as Apollonia, they\r\nvisited Lydasburgt and the Alderga. Afterwards they made a tour of all\r\nthe neighbourhood of Stavera. They behaved with so much amiability,\r\nthat everywhere the people wished to keep them. Three months later,\r\nAdel sent messengers to all the friends that he had made, requesting\r\nthem to send to him their \"wise men\" in the month of May.\r\n\r\nhis wife, he said, who had been maagd of Texland, had received a copy\r\nof it. In Texland many writings are still found which are not copied\r\nin the book of the Adelingen. One of these writings had been placed by\r\nGosa with her last will, which was to be opened by the oldest maiden,\r\nAlbetha, as soon as Friso was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS THE WRITING WITH GOSA'S ADVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Wr-alda gave children to the mothers of mankind, he gave one\r\nlanguage to every tongue and to all lips. This gift Wr-alda had\r\nbestowed upon men in order that by its means they might make known\r\nto each other what must be avoided and what must be followed to find\r\nsalvation, and to hold salvation to all eternity. Wr-alda is wise\r\nand good, and all-foreseeing. As he knew that happiness and holiness\r\nwould flee from the earth when wickedness could overcome virtue,\r\nhe has attached to the language an equitable property. This property\r\nconsists in this, that men can neither lie nor use deceitful words\r\nwithout stammering or blushing, by which means the innately bad are\r\neasily known.\r\n\r\nAs thus our language opens the way to happiness and blessedness,\r\nand thus helps to guard against evil inclinations, it is rightly\r\nnamed the language of the gods, and all those by whom it is held in\r\nhonour derive honour from it. But what has happened? As soon as among\r\nour half brothers and sisters deceivers arose, who gave themselves\r\nout as servants of the good, it soon became otherwise. The deceitful\r\npriests and the malignant princes, who always clung together, wished\r\nto live according to their own inclinations, without regard to the\r\nlaws of right. In their wickedness they went so far as to invent other\r\nlanguages, so that they might speak secretly in anybody's presence\r\nof their wicked and unworthy affairs without betraying themselves by\r\nstammering, and without showing a blush upon their countenances. But\r\nwhat has that produced? Just as the seed of good herbs which has\r\nbeen sown by good men in the open day springs up from the ground,\r\nso time brings to light the evil seed which has been sown by wicked\r\nmen in secret and in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe wanton girls and effeminate youths who consorted with the immoral\r\npriests and princes, taught the new language to their companions,\r\nand thus spread it among the people till God's language was clean\r\nforgotten. Would you know what came of all this? how that stammering\r\nand blushing no longer betrayed their evil doings;--virtue passed\r\naway, wisdom and liberty followed; unity was lost, and quarrelling\r\ntook its place; love flew away, and unchastity and envy met round\r\ntheir tables; and where previously justice reigned, now it is the\r\nsword. All are slaves--the subjects of their masters, envy, bad\r\npassions and covetousness. If they had only invented one language\r\nthings might possibly have still gone on well; but they invented as\r\nmany languages as there are states, so that one people can no more\r\nunderstand another people than a cow a dog, or a wolf a sheep. The\r\nmariners can bear witness to this. From all this it results that\r\nall the slave people look upon each other as strangers; and that as\r\na punishment of their inconsiderateness and presumption, they must\r\nquarrel and fight till they are all destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS MY COUNSEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish that you alone should inherit the earth, you must never\r\nallow any language but God's language to pass your lips, and take care\r\nthat your own language remains free from outlandish sounds. If you\r\nwish that some of Lyda's children and some of Finda's children remain,\r\nyou must do the same. The language of the East Schoonlanders has been\r\nperverted by the vile Magyars, and the language of the followers\r\nof Kaltana has been spoiled by the dirty Gauls. Now, we have been\r\nweak enough to admit among us the returned followers of Hellenia,\r\nbut I anxiously fear that they will reward our weakness by debasing\r\nour pure language.\r\n\r\nMany things have happened to us, but among all the citadels that have\r\nbeen disturbed and destroyed in the bad time, Irtha has preserved\r\nFryasburgt uninjured; and I may remark that Frya's or God's language\r\nhas always remained here untainted.\r\n\r\nHere in Texland, therefore, schools should be established; and from all\r\nthe states that have kept to the old customs the young people should\r\nbe sent here, and afterwards those whose education is complete can\r\nhelp those who remain at home. If foreigners come to buy ironwares\r\nfrom you, and want to talk and bargain, they must come back to God's\r\nlanguage. If they learn God's language, then the words, \"to be free\"\r\nand \"to have justice,\" will come to them, and glimmer and glitter in\r\ntheir brains to a perfect light, and that flame will destroy all bad\r\nprinces and hypocritical dirty priests.\r\n\r\nThe native and foreign messengers were pleased with that writing, but\r\nno schools came from it. Then Adel established schools himself. Every\r\nyear Adel and Ifkja went to inspect the schools. If they found a\r\nfriendly feeling existing between the natives and foreigners, they\r\nwere extremely pleased. If there were any who had sworn friendship\r\ntogether, they assembled the people, and with great ceremony let them\r\ninscribe their names in a book which was called the Book of Friendship,\r\nand afterwards a festival was held. All these customs were kept up\r\nin order to bring together the separate branches of Frya's race;\r\nbut the maidens who were opposed to Adel and Ifkja said that they\r\ndid it for no other reason than to make a name for themselves, and\r\nto bring all the other states under their subjection.\r\n\r\nAmong my father's papers I found a letter from Liudgert the\r\nGeertman. Omitting some passages which only concern my father,\r\nI proceed to relate the rest.\r\n\r\nPunjab, that is five rivers, and by which we travel, is a river of\r\nextraordinary beauty, and is called Five Rivers, because four other\r\nstreams flow into the sea by its mouth. Far away to the eastward is\r\nanother large river, the Holy or Sacred Ganges. Between these two\r\nrivers is the land of the Hindoos. Both rivers run from the high\r\nmountains to the plains. The mountains in which their sources lie\r\nare so high that they reach the heavens (laia), and therefore these\r\nmountains are called Himmellaia. Among the Hindoos and others out of\r\nthese countries there are people who meet together secretly. They\r\nbelieve that they are pure children of Finda, and that Finda was\r\nborn in the Himmellaia mountains, whence she went with her children\r\nto the lowlands. Some of them believe that she, with her children,\r\nfloated down upon the foam of the Ganges, and that that is the reason\r\nwhy the river is called the Sacred Ganges. But the priests, who came\r\nfrom another country, traced out these people and had them burnt, so\r\nthat they do not dare to declare openly their creed. In this country\r\nall the priests are fat and rich. In their churches there are all\r\nkinds of monstrous images, many of them of gold. To the west of the\r\nPunjab are the Yren (Iraniers), or morose (Drangianen), the Gedrosten\r\n(Gedrosiers), or runaways, and the Urgetten, or forgotten. These\r\nnames are given by the priests out of spite, because they fled\r\nfrom their customs and religion. On their arrival our forefathers\r\nlikewise established themselves to the east of the Punjab, but on\r\naccount of the priests they likewise went to the west. In that way we\r\nlearned to know the Yren and other people. The Yren are not savages,\r\nbut good people, who neither pray to nor tolerate images; neither\r\nwill they suffer priests or churches; but as we adhere to the light\r\nof Fasta, so they everywhere maintain fire in their houses. Coming\r\nstill further westward, we arrive at the Gedrosten. Regarding the\r\nGedrosten: They have been mixed with other people, and speak a variety\r\nof languages. These people are really savage murderers, who always\r\nwander about the country on horseback hunting and robbing, and hire\r\nthemselves as soldiers to the surrounding princes, at whose command\r\nthey destroy whatever they can reach.\r\n\r\nThe country between the Punjab and the Ganges is as flat as Friesland\r\nnear the sea, and consists of forests and fields, fertile in every\r\npart, but this does not prevent the people from dying by thousands\r\nof hunger. The famines, however, must not be attributed to Wr-alda\r\nor Irtha, but to the princes and priests. The Hindoos are timid and\r\nsubmissive before their princes, like hinds before wolves. Therefore\r\nthe Yren and others have called them Hindoos, which means hinds. But\r\ntheir timidity is frightfully abused. If strangers come to purchase\r\ncorn, everything is turned into money, and this is not prevented by\r\nthe priests, because they, being more crafty and rapacious than all\r\nthe princes put together, know very well that all the money will come\r\ninto their pockets. Besides what the people suffer from their princes,\r\nthey suffer a great deal from poisonous and wild beasts. There are\r\ngreat elephants that sometimes go about in whole flocks and trample\r\ndown corn-fields and whole villages. There are great black and white\r\ncats which are called tigers. They are as large as calves, and they\r\ndevour both men and beasts. Besides other creeping animals there are\r\nsnakes from the size of a worm to the size of a tree. The largest\r\ncan swallow a cow, but the smallest are the most deadly. They conceal\r\nthemselves among the fruits and flowers, and surprise the people who\r\ncome to gather them. Any one who is bitten by them is sure to die,\r\nas Irtha has given no antidote to their poison, because the people\r\nhave so given themselves up to idolatry. There are, besides, all\r\nsorts of lizards, tortoises, and crocodiles. All these reptiles,\r\nlike the snakes, vary from the size of a worm to the trunk of a\r\ntree. According to their size and fierceness, they have names which I\r\ncannot recollect, but the largest are called alligators, because they\r\neat as greedily the putrid cattle that float down the stream as they\r\ndo living animals that they seize. On the west of the Punjab where we\r\ncome from, and where I was born, the same fruits and crops grow as on\r\nthe east side. Formerly there existed also the same crawling animals,\r\nbut our forefathers burnt all the underwood, and so diligently hunted\r\nall the wild animals, that there are scarcely any left. To the extreme\r\nwest of the Punjab there is found rich clay land as well as barren\r\nheaths, which seem endless, occasionally varied lovely spots on which\r\nthe eye rests enchanted. Among the fruits there are many that I have\r\nnot found here. Among the various kinds of corn some is as yellow\r\nas gold. There are also golden apples, of which some are as sweet as\r\nhoney and others as sour as vinegar. In our country there are nuts as\r\nlarge as a child's head. They contain cheese and milk. When they are\r\nold oil is made from them. Of the husks ropes are made, and of the\r\nshells cups and other household utensils are made. I have found in\r\nthe woods here bramble and holly berries. In my country we have trees\r\nbearing berries, as large as your lime-trees, the berries of which\r\nare much sweeter and three times as large as your gooseberries. When\r\nthe days are at the longest, and the sun is in the zenith, a man's\r\nbody has no shadow. If you sail very far to the south and look to\r\nthe east at midday, the sun shines on your left side as it does in\r\nother countries on the right side. With this I will finish. It will\r\nbe easy for you, by means of what I have written, to distinguish\r\nbetween false accounts and true descriptions.--Your Luidgert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITING OF BEEDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Beeden, son of Hachgana. My uncle, not having married,\r\nleft no children. I was elected in his place. Adel, the third king\r\nof that name, approved of the choice, provided I should acknowledge\r\nhim as master. In addition to the entire inheritance of my uncle,\r\nhe gave me some land which joined my inheritance, on condition that\r\nI would settle people there who should never his people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore I will allow it a place here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF RIKA THE OUDMAAGD, READ AT STAVEREN AT THE JUUL FEAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy greeting to all of you whose forefathers came here with\r\nFriso. According to what you say, you are not guilty of idolatry. I\r\nwill not speak about that now, but will at once mention a failing which\r\nis very little better. You know, or you do not know, how many titles\r\nWr-alda has; but you all know that he is named universal provider,\r\nbecause that everything comes and proceeds from him for the sustenance\r\nof his creatures. It is true that Irtha is named sometimes the feeder\r\nof all, because she brings forth all the fruits and grains on which men\r\nand beasts are fed; but she would not bear any fruit or grain unless\r\nWr-alda gave her the power. Women who nourish their children at their\r\nbreasts are called nurses, but if Wr-alda did not give them milk the\r\nchildren would find no advantage; so that, in short, Wr-alda really is\r\nthe nourisher. That Irtha should be called the universal nourisher,\r\nand that a mother should be called a feeder, one can understand,\r\nfiguratively speaking; but that a father should be called a feeder,\r\nbecause he is a father, goes against all reason. Now I know whence\r\nall this folly comes. Listen to me. It comes from our enemies; and\r\nif this is followed up you will become slaves, to the sorrow of Frya\r\nand to the punishment of your pride, I will tell you what happened to\r\nthe slave people; from that you may take warning. The foreign kings,\r\nwho follow their own will, place Wr-alda below the crown. From envy\r\nthat Wr-alda is called the universal father, they wish also to be\r\ncalled fathers of the people. Now, everybody knows that kings do\r\nnot regulate the productiveness of the earth; and that they have\r\ntheir sustenance by means of the people, but still they will persist\r\nin their arrogance. In order to attain their object they were not\r\nsatisfied from the beginning with free gifts, but imposed a tax upon\r\nthe people. With the tax thus raised they hired foreign soldiers, whom\r\nthey retained about their courts. Afterwards they took as many wives as\r\nthey pleased, and the smaller princes and gentry did the same. When,\r\nin consequence, quarrels and disputes arose in the households, and\r\ncomplaints were made about it, they said every man is the father\r\n(feeder) of his household, therefore he shall be master and judge\r\nover it. Thus arose arbitrariness, and as the men ruled over their\r\nhouseholds the kings would do over their people. When the kings had\r\naccomplished that, they should be called fathers of the people,\r\nthey had statues of themselves made, and erected in the churches\r\nbeside the statues of the idols, and those who would not bow down\r\nto them were either killed or put in chains. Your forefathers and\r\nthe Twisklanders had intercourse with the kings, and learned these\r\nfollies from them. But it is not only that some of your men have been\r\nguilty of stealing titles, I have also much to complain of against\r\nyour wives. If there are men among you who wish to put themselves\r\non a level with Wr-alda, there are also women who wish to consider\r\nthemselves equals of Frya. Because they have borne children, they call\r\nthemselves mothers; but they forget that Frya bore children without\r\nhaving intercourse with a man. Yes, they not only have desired to rob\r\nFrya and the Eeremoeders of their honourable title (with whom they\r\ncannot put themselves upon an equality), but they do the same with\r\nthe honourable titles of their fellow-creatures. There are women who\r\nallow themselves to be called ladies, although they know that that\r\nonly belongs to the wives of princes. They also let their daughters be\r\ncalled maagden, although they know that no young girls are so called\r\nunless they belong to a citadel. You all fancy that you are the better\r\nfor this name-stealing, but you forget that jealousy clings to it,\r\nand that every wrong sows the seed of its own rod. If you do not alter\r\nyour course, in time it will grow so strong that you cannot see what\r\nwill be the end. Your descendants will be flogged by it, and will not\r\nknow whence the stripes come. But although you do not build citadels\r\nfor the maidens and leave them to their fate, there will still remain\r\nsome who will come out of woods and caves, and will prove to your\r\ndescendants that you have by your disorderliness been the cause of\r\nit. Then you will be damned. Your ghosts will rise frightened out of\r\ntheir graves. They will call upon Wr-alda, Frya, and her maidens, but\r\nthey shall receive no succour before the Juul shall enter upon a new\r\ncircuit, and that will only be three thousand years after this century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE END OF RIKA'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore I will first write about black Adel. Black Adel was the\r\nfourth king after Friso. In his youth he studied first at Texland, and\r\nthen at Staveren, and afterwards travelled through all the states. When\r\nhe was twenty-four years old his father had him elected Asega-Asker. As\r\nsoon as he became Asker he always took the part of the poor. The rich,\r\nhe said, do enough of wrong by means of their wealth, therefore we\r\nought to take care that the poor look up to us. By arguments of this\r\nkind he became the friend of the poor and the terror of the rich. It\r\nwas carried so far that his father looked up to him. When his father\r\ndied he succeeded, and then he wished to retain his office as well,\r\nas the kings of the East used to do. The rich would not suffer this,\r\nso all the people rose up, and the rich were glad to get out of the\r\nassembly with whole skins. From that time there was no more talk of\r\nequality. He oppressed the rich and flattered the poor, by whose\r\nassistance he succeeded in all his wishes. King Askar, as he was\r\nalways called, was seven feet high, and his strength was as remarkable\r\nas his height. He had a clear intellect, so that he understood all\r\nthat was talked about, but in his actions he did not display much\r\nwisdom. He had a handsome countenance and a smooth tongue, but his\r\nsoul was blacker than his hair. When he had been king for a year,\r\nhe obliged all the young men in the state to come once a year to the\r\ncamp to have a sham fight. At first he had some trouble with it, but\r\nat last it became such a habit that old and young came from all sides\r\nto ask if they might take part in it. When he had brought it to this\r\npoint, he established military schools. The rich complained that their\r\nchildren no longer learned to read and write. Askar paid no attention\r\nto it; but shortly afterwards, when a sham fight was held, he mounted\r\na throne and spoke aloud: The rich have come to complain to me that\r\ntheir boys do not learn to read and write. I answered nothing; but I\r\nwill now declare my opinion, and let the general assembly decide. While\r\nthey all regarded him with curiosity, he said further: According to my\r\nidea, we ought to leave reading and writing at present to the maagden\r\nand wise people. I do not wish to speak ill of our forefathers; I\r\nwill only say that in the times so vaunted by some, the Burgtmaagden\r\nintroduced disputes into our country, which the mothers were unable,\r\neither first or last, to put an end to. Worse still, while they talked\r\nand chattered about useless customs the Gauls came and seized all our\r\nbeautiful southern country. Even at this very time our degenerate\r\nbrothers and their soldiers have already come over the Scheldt. It\r\ntherefore remains for us to choose whether we will carry a yoke or\r\na sword. If we wish to be and to remain free, it behoves our young\r\nmen to leave reading and writing alone for a time; and instead of\r\nplaying games of swinging and wrestling, they must learn to play with\r\nsword and spear. When we are completely prepared, and the boys are\r\nbig enough to carry helmet and shield and to use their weapons, then,\r\nwith your help, I will attack the enemy. The Gauls may then record the\r\ndefeat of their helpers and soldiers upon our fields with the blood\r\nthat flows from their wounds. When we have once expelled the enemy,\r\nthen we must follow it up till there are no more Gauls, Slaves,\r\nor Tartars to be driven out of Frya's inheritance. That is right,\r\nthe majority shouted, and the rich did not dare to open their mouths.\r\n\r\nHe must certainly have thought over this address and had it written\r\nout, for on the evening of the same day there were copies in at least\r\ntwenty different hands, and they all sounded the same. Afterwards\r\nhe ordered the ship people to make double prows, upon which steel\r\ncrossbows could be fixed. Those who were backward in doing this\r\nwere fined, and if they swore that they had no means, the rich men\r\nof the village were obliged to pay. Now we shall see what resulted\r\nfrom all this bustle. In the north part of Britain there exists a\r\nScotch people--the most of them spring from Frya's blood--some of\r\nthem are descended from the followers of Keltana, and, for the rest,\r\nfrom Britons and fugitives who gradually, in the course of time, took\r\nrefuge there from the tin mines. Those who come from the tin mines\r\nhave wives, either altogether foreign or of foreign descent They are\r\nall under the dominion of the Gauls. Their arms are wooden bows and\r\narrows pointed with stag's-horn or flint. Their houses are of turf and\r\nstraw, and some of them live in caves in the mountains. Sheep that\r\nthey have stolen form their only wealth. Some of the descendants of\r\nKeltana's followers still have iron weapons, which they have inherited\r\nfrom their forefathers. In order to make myself well understood,\r\nI must let alone for a while my account of the Scotch people,\r\nand write something about the near Krekalanders (Italians). The\r\nKrekalanders formerly belonged to us only, but from time immemorial\r\ndescendants of Lyda and Finda have established themselves there. Of\r\nthese last there came in the end a whole troop from Troy. Troy is\r\nthe name of a town that the far Krekalanders (Greeks) had taken and\r\ndestroyed. When the Trojans had nestled themselves among the near\r\nKrekalanders, with time and industry they built a strong town with\r\nwalls and citadels named Rome, that is, Spacious. When this was done,\r\nthe people by craft and force made themselves masters of the whole\r\nland. The people who live on the south side of the Mediterranean Sea,\r\ncome for the most part from Phoenicia. The Phoenicians (Puniers or\r\nCarthaginians) are a bastard race of the blood of Frya, Finda, and\r\nLyda. The Lyda people were there as slaves, but by the unchastity of\r\nthe women these black people have degenerated the other people and\r\ndyed them brown. These people and the Romans are constantly struggling\r\nfor the supremacy over the Mediterranean Sea. The Romans, moreover,\r\nlive at enmity with the Phoenicians; and their priests, who wish to\r\nassume the sole government of the world, cannot bear the sight of the\r\nGauls. First they took from the Phoenicians Marseilles--then all the\r\ncountries lying to the south, the west, and the north, as well as\r\nthe southern part of Britain--and they have always driven away the\r\nPhoenician priests, that is the Gauls, of whom thousands have sought\r\nrefuge in North Britain. A short time ago the chief of the Gauls was\r\nestablished in the citadel, which is called Kerenac (Karnac), that\r\nis the corner, whence he issued his commands to the Gauls. All their\r\ngold was likewise collected there. Keeren Herne (chosen corner), or\r\nKerenac, is a stone citadel which did belong to Kalta. Therefore the\r\nmaidens of the descendants of Kaltana's followers wished to have the\r\ncitadel again. Thus through the enmity of the maidens and the Gaul's,\r\nhatred and quarrelling spread ever the mountain country with fire and\r\nsword. Our sea people often came there to get wool, which they paid\r\nfor with prepared hides and linen. Askar had often gone with them,\r\nand had secretly made friendship with the maidens and some princes,\r\nand bound himself to drive the Gauls out of Kerenac. When he came\r\nback there again he gave to the princes and the fighting men iron\r\nhelmets and steel bows. War had come with him, and soon blood was\r\nstreaming down the slopes of the mountains. When Askar thought a\r\nfavourable opportunity occurred, he vent with forty ships and took\r\nKerenac and the chief of the Gauls, with all his gold. The people\r\nwith whom he fought against the soldiers of the Gauls, he had enticed\r\nout of the Saxenmarken by promises of much booty and plunder. Thus\r\nnothing was left to the Gauls. After that he took two islands for\r\nstations for his ships, from which he used later to sally forth and\r\nplunder all the Phoenician ships and towns that he could reach. When\r\nhe returned he brought nearly six hundred of the finest youths of the\r\nScotch mountaineers with him. He said that they had been given him as\r\nhostages, that he might be sure that the parents would remain faithful\r\nto him; but this was untrue. He kept them as a bodyguard at his court,\r\nwhere they had daily lessons in riding and in the use of all kinds of\r\narms. The Denmarkers, who proudly considered themselves sea-warriors\r\nabove all the other sea-people, no sooner heard of the glorious\r\ndeeds of Askar, than they became jealous of him to such a degree,\r\nthat they would bring war over the sea and over his lands. See here,\r\nthen, how he was able to avoid a war. Among the ruins of the destroyed\r\ncitadel of Stavia there was still established a clever Burgtmaagd,\r\nwith a few maidens. Her name was Reintja, and she was famed for\r\nher wisdom. This maid offered her assistance to Askar, on condition\r\nthat he should afterwards rebuild the citadel of Stavia. When he had\r\nbound himself to do this, Reintja went with three maidens to Hals\r\n(Holstein). She travelled by night, and by day she made speeches in\r\nall the markets and in all the assemblies. Wr-alda, she said, had told\r\nher by his thunder that all the Frya's people must become friends,\r\nand united as brothers and sisters, otherwise Finda's people would\r\ncome and sweep them off the face of the earth. After the thunder\r\nFrya's seven watch-maidens appeared to her in a dream seven nights\r\nin succession. They had said, Disaster hovers over Frya's land with\r\nyoke and chains; therefore all the people who have sprung from Frya's\r\nblood must do away with their surnames, and only call themselves Frya's\r\nchildren, or Frya's people. They must all rise up and drive Finda's\r\npeople out of Frya's inheritance. If you will not do that, you will\r\nbring the slave-chains round your necks, and the foreign chiefs will\r\nill-treat your children and flog them till the blood streams into your\r\ngraves. Then shall the spirits of your forefathers appear to you, and\r\nreproach your cowardice and thoughtlessness. The stupid people who,\r\nby the acts of the Magyars, were already so much accustomed to folly,\r\nbelieved all that she said, and the mothers clasped their children\r\nto their bosoms. When Reintja had brought the king of Holstein and\r\nthe others to an agreement, she sent messengers to Askar, and went\r\nherself along the Baltic Sea. From there she went to the Lithauers\r\n(Face-hewers), so called because they always strike at their enemy's\r\nface. The Lithauers are fugitives and banished people of our own race,\r\nwho wander about in the Twisklanden. Their wives have been mostly\r\nstolen from the Tartars. The Tartars are a branch of Finda's race,\r\nand are thus named by the Twisklanders because they never will be\r\nat peace, but provoke people to fight. She proceeded on beyond the\r\nSaxsenmarken, crossing through the other Twisklanders in order always\r\nto repeat the same thing. After two years had passed, she came along\r\nthe Rhine home. Among the Twisklanders she gave herself out for a\r\nmother, and said that they might return as free and true people;\r\nbut then they must go over the Rhine and drive the Gauls out of\r\nFrya's south lands. If they did that, then her King Askar would go\r\nover the Scheldt and win back the land. Among the Twisklanders many\r\nbad customs of the Tartars and Magyars have crept in, but likewise\r\nmany of our laws have remained. Therefore they still have Maagden,\r\nwho teach the children and advise the old. In the beginning they were\r\nopposed to Reintja, but at last she was followed, obeyed, and praised\r\nby them where it was useful or necessary.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Askar heard from Reintja's messengers how the Jutlanders\r\nwere disposed, he immediately, on his side, sent messengers to the\r\nKing of Hals. The ship in which the messengers went was laden with\r\nwomen's ornaments, and took also a golden shield on which Askar's\r\nportrait was artistically represented. These messengers were to ask\r\nthe King's daughter, Frethogunsta, in marriage for Askar. Frethogunsta\r\ncame a year after that to Staveren. Among her followers was a Magy,\r\nfor the Jutlanders had been long ago corrupted. Soon after Askar had\r\nmarried Frethogunsta, a church was built at Staveren. In the church\r\nwere placed monstrous images, bedecked with gold-woven dresses. It is\r\nalso said that Askar, by night, and at unseasonable times, kneeled\r\nto them with Frethogunsta; but one thing is certain, the citadel of\r\nStavia was never rebuilt. Reintja was already come back, and went\r\nangrily to Prontlik the mother, at Texland, to complain. Prontlik sent\r\nout messengers in all directions, who proclaimed that Askar is gone\r\nover to Idolatry. Askar took no notice of this, but unexpectedly a\r\nfleet arrived from Hals. In the night the maidens were driven out\r\nof the citadel, and in the morning there was nothing to be seen\r\nof the citadel but a glowing heap of rubbish. Prontlik and Reintja\r\ncame to me for shelter. When I reflected upon it, I thought that it\r\nmight prove bad for my state. Therefore, we hit upon a plan which\r\nmight serve us all. This is the way we went to work. In the middle\r\nof the Krijlwood, to the east of Liudwerd, lies our place of refuge,\r\nwhich can only be reached by a concealed path. A long time ago I had\r\nestablished a garrison of young men who all hated Askar, and kept away\r\nall other people. Now it was come to such a pitch among us, that many\r\nwomen, and even men, talked about ghosts, white women, and gnomes,\r\njust like the Denmarkers. Askar had made use of all these follies\r\nfor his own advantage, and we wished to do the same. One dark night\r\nI brought the Maagden to the citadel, and afterwards they went with\r\ntheir serving-maids dressed in white along the path, so that nobody\r\ndare go there any more. When Askar thought he had his hands free, he\r\nlet the Magyars travel through his states under all kinds of names,\r\nand, except in my state, they were not turned away anywhere. After\r\nthat Askar had become so connected with the Jutlanders and the\r\nDenmarkers, they all went roving together; but it produced no real\r\ngood to them. They brought all sorts of foreign treasures home, and\r\njust for that reason the young men would learn no trades, nor work\r\nin the fields; so at last he was obliged to take slaves; but that was\r\naltogether contrary to Wr-alda's wish and to Frya's counsel. Therefore\r\nthe punishment was sure to follow it. This is the way in which the\r\npunishment came. They had all together taken a whole fleet that came\r\nout of the Mediterranean Sea. This fleet was laden with purple cloths\r\nand other valuables that came from Phoenicia. The weak people of\r\nthe fleet were put ashore south of the Seine, but the strong people\r\nwere kept to serve as slaves. The handsomest were retained ashore,\r\nand the ugly and black were kept on board ship as rowers. In the\r\nFly the plunder was divided, but, without their knowing it, they\r\ndivided the punishment too. Of those who were placed in the foreign\r\nships six died of colic. It was thought that the food and drink were\r\npoisoned, so it was all thrown overboard, but the colic remained all\r\nthe same. Wherever the slaves or the goods came, there it came too. The\r\nSaxsenmen took it over to their marches. The Jutlanders brought it to\r\nSchoonland and along the coasts of the Baltic Sea, and with Askar's\r\nmariners it was taken to Britain. We and the people of Grênegâ did not\r\nallow either the people or the goods to come over our boundaries, and\r\ntherefore we remained free from it. How many people were carried off\r\nby this disease I cannot tell; but Prontlik, who heard it afterwards\r\nfrom the maidens, told me that Askar had helped out of his states a\r\nthousand times more free-men than he had brought dirty slaves in. When\r\nthe pest had ceased, the Twisklanders who had become free came to\r\nthe Rhine, but Askar would not put himself on an equality with the\r\nprinces of that vile degenerate race. He would not suffer them to\r\ncall themselves Frya's children, as Reintja had offered them, but he\r\nforgot then that he himself had black hair. Among the Twisklanders\r\nthere were two tribes who did not call themselves Twisklanders. One\r\ncame from the far south-east, and called themselves Allemannen. They\r\nhad given themselves this name when they had no women among them,\r\nand were wandering as exiles in the forests. Later on they stole\r\nwomen from the slave people like the Lithauers, but they kept their\r\nname. The other tribe, that wandered about in the neighbourhood,\r\ncalled themselves Franks, not because they were free, but the name\r\nof their first king was Frank, who, by the help of the degenerate\r\nmaidens, had had himself made hereditary king over his people. The\r\npeople nearest to him called themselves Thioth--his sons--that is,\r\nsons of the people. They had remained free, because they never would\r\nacknowledge any king, or prince, or master except those chosen by\r\ngeneral consent in a general assembly. Askar had already learned from\r\nReintja that the Twisklander princes were almost always at war with\r\neach other. He proposed to them that they should choose a duke from\r\nhis people, because, as he said, he was afraid that they would quarrel\r\namong themselves for the supremacy. He said also that his princes\r\ncould speak with the Gauls. This, he said, was also the opinion of the\r\nmother. Then the princes of the Twisklanders came together, and after\r\ntwenty-one days they chose Alrik as duke. Alrik was Askar's nephew. He\r\ngave him two hundred Scotch and one hundred of the greatest Saksmannen\r\nto go with him as a bodyguard, The princes were to send twenty-one\r\nof their sons as hostages for their fidelity. Thus far all had gone\r\naccording to his wishes; but when they were to go over the Rhine, the\r\nking of the Franks would not be under Alrik's command. Thereupon all\r\nwas confusion. Askar, who thought that all was going on well, landed\r\nwith his ships on the other side of the Scheldt; but there they were\r\nalready aware of his coming, and were on their guard. He had to flee\r\nas quickly as he had come, and was himself taken prisoner. The Gauls\r\ndid not know whom they had taken, so he was afterwards exchanged for\r\na noble Gaul whom Askar's people had taken with them. While all this\r\nwas going on, the Magyars went about audaciously over the lands of\r\nour neighbours. Near Egmuda, where formerly the citadel Forana had\r\nstood, they built a church larger and richer than that which Askar\r\nhad built at Staveren. They said afterwards that Askar had lost the\r\nbattle against the Gauls, because the people did not believe that\r\nWodin could help them, and therefore they would not pray to him. They\r\nwent about stealing young children, whom they kept and brought up in\r\nthe mysteries of their abominable doctrines. Were there people who\r\n\r\n\r\n                  [Here the manuscript ends abruptly.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADELA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOKKE MIN SVN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThissa boka mot i mith lif ånd sêle wârja.
