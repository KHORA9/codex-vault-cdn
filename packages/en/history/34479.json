Amongst\r\nothers, he is particularly indebted to Dr. Traill, of Liverpool, who\r\nafter proceeding to some length with a translation of this work, kindly\r\nplaced what he had completed in the hands of the Translator, with\r\nliberty to make such use of it as might be deemed advantageous to the\r\npresent undertaking. To Mr. W. Y. Ottley, who also contemplated, and in\r\npart executed, a version of the same author, the Translator has to\r\nexpress his obligations for several explanations of terms of art, which\r\nthe intimacy of that gentleman with the fine arts, in all their\r\nbranches, peculiarly qualifies him to impart.[1] Similar acknowledgments\r\nare due to an enlightened and learned foreigner, Mr. Panizzi, of\r\nLiverpool, for his kind explanation of various obscure phrases and\r\ndoubtful passages.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the anxious desire and unremitting endeavours of the\r\nTranslator to render this work, in all instances, as accurate as the\r\nnature of the subject, and the numerous difficulties he had to surmount\r\nwould allow, yet, in dismissing it from his hands, he cannot repress the\r\nfeeling that he must throw himself upon the indulgence of the public to\r\nexcuse such errors as may be discoverable in the text. He trusts,\r\nhowever, that where it may be found incorrect, it will for the most part\r\nbe in those passages where doubtful terms of art lay in his way,\r\nintelligible only to the initiated, and which perhaps many of the\r\ncountrymen of Lanzi themselves might not be able very readily to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following are among the valuable works which have been\r\ngiven to the public by Mr. Ottley:--The Italian School of Design, being\r\na series of Fac-similes of Original Drawings, &c.--An Inquiry into the\r\nHistory of Engraving.--The Stafford Gallery.--A Series of Plates\r\nengraved after the Paintings and Sculptures of the most eminent masters\r\nof the early Florentine School, during the 13th, 14th, and 15th\r\ncenturies.

Hence it mostly happens, that the diffuse compositions\r\nof earlier ages are found to give place to compendiums, and to succinct\r\nhistory. If this desire has prevailed in former times, it has been, and\r\nnow is, more especially the characteristic of our own. We live in an age\r\nhighly favourable, in one sense at least, to the cultivation of\r\nintellect: the boundaries of science are now extended beyond what our\r\nforefathers could have hoped, much less foreseen; and we become anxious\r\nonly to discover the readiest methods of obtaining a competent\r\nknowledge, at least, of several sciences, since it is impossible to\r\nacquire them all. On the other hand, the ages preceding ours, since the\r\nrevival of learning, being more occupied about words than things, and\r\nadmiring certain objects that now seem trivial to the generality of\r\nreaders, have produced historical compositions, the separate nature of\r\nwhich demands combination, no less than their prolixity requires\r\nabridgment.\r\n\r\nIf these observations are applicable to other branches of history, they\r\nare especially so to the history of painting. Its materials are found\r\nready prepared, scattered through numerous memoirs of artists of every\r\nschool which, from time to time, have been given to the public: and\r\nadditional articles are supplied by dictionaries of art, letters on\r\npainting, guides to several cities, catalogues of various collections,\r\nand by many tracts relating to different artists, which have been\r\npublished in Italy. But these accounts, independent of want of\r\nconnexion, are not useful to the generality of readers. Who, indeed,\r\ncould form a just idea of painting in Italy by perusing the works of\r\ncertain historians of latter ages, and some even of our own time, which\r\nabound in invectives, and in attempts to exalt favourite masters above\r\nthe artists of all other schools; and which confer eulogies\r\nindiscriminately upon professors of first, second, or third-rate\r\nmerit?[2] How few are there who feel interested in knowing all that is\r\nsaid of artists with so much verbosity by Vasari, Pascoli, or\r\nBaldinucci; their low jests, their amours, their private affairs, and\r\ntheir eccentricities? What do we learn by being informed of the\r\njealousies of the Florentine artists, the quarrels of the Roman, or the\r\nboasts of the Bolognian schools? Who can endure the verbal accuracy with\r\nwhich their wills and testaments are recorded, even to the subscription\r\nof the notary, as if the author had been drawing up a legal document; or\r\nthe descriptions of their stature and physiognomy, more minute than the\r\nancients afford us of Alexander or Augustus?[3] Not that I object to the\r\nintroduction of such particulars in the lives of the great luminaries of\r\nart: in a Raffaello or a Caracci minute circumstances derive interest\r\nfrom the subject; but how intolerable do they become in the life of an\r\nordinary individual, where the principal incidents are but little\r\ninteresting? Suetonius has not written the lives of his Caesars and his\r\ngrammarians in the same manner: the former he has rendered familiar to\r\nthe reader; the latter are merely noticed and passed over.\r\n\r\nThe tastes of individuals, however, are different, and some people\r\ndelight in minutiae, as it regards both the present and the past; and\r\nsince it may be of utility to those who may hereafter be inclined to\r\ngive a very full and perfect history of every thing relating to Italian\r\npainting, let us view with indulgence those who have employed themselves\r\nin compiling lives so copious, and let those who have time to spare,\r\nbeguile it with their perusal. At the same time, due regard should be\r\npaid to that very respectable class of readers, who, in a history of\r\npainting, would rather contemplate the artist than the man; and who are\r\nless solicitous to become acquainted with the character of a single\r\npainter, whose solitary and insulated history cannot prove instructive,\r\nthan with the genius, the method, the invention, and the style of a\r\ngreat number of artists, with their characteristics, their merits, and\r\ntheir rank, the result of which is a history of the whole art.\r\n\r\nTo this object there is no one whom I know who has hitherto dedicated\r\nhis pen, although it seems to be recommended no less by the passion\r\nindulged by princes for the fine arts, than by the general diffusion of\r\na knowledge of them among all ranks. The habit of travelling, rendered\r\nmore familiar to private persons by the example of many great\r\nsovereigns, the traffic in pictures, now become a branch of commerce\r\nimportant to Italy, and the philosophic genius of this age, which shuns\r\nprolixity in every study, and requires systematic arrangement, are\r\nadditional incentives to the task. It is true that very pleasing and\r\ninstructive biographical sketches of the most celebrated painters have\r\nbeen published by M. d'Argenville, in France; and various epitomes have\r\nsince appeared, in which the style of painting alone is discussed.[4]\r\nBut without taking into account the corruptions of the names of our\r\ncountrymen in which their authors have indulged, or their omission of\r\ncelebrated Italians, while they record less eminent artists of other\r\ncountries, no work of this sort, and still less any dictionary, can\r\nafford us a systematic history of painting: none of these exhibit those\r\npictures, if we may be allowed the expression, in which we may, at a\r\nglance, trace the progress and series of events; none of them exhibit\r\nthe principal masters of the art in a sufficiently conspicuous point of\r\nview, while inferior artists are reduced to their proper size and\r\nstation: far less can we discover in them those epochs and revolutions\r\nof the art, which the judicious reader most anxiously desires to know,\r\nas the source from which he may trace the causes that have contributed\r\nto its revival or its decline; or from which he may be enabled to\r\nrecollect the series, and the arrangement of the facts narrated. The\r\nhistory of painting has a strong analogy to literary, to civil, and to\r\nsacred history; it too requires, from time to time, the aid of certain\r\nbeacons, some particular distinction in regard to places, times, or\r\nevents, that may serve to divide it into epochs, and mark its successive\r\nstages. Deprive it of these, and it degenerates, like other history,\r\ninto a chaos of names more calculated to load the memory than to inform\r\nthe understanding.\r\n\r\nTo supply this hitherto neglected branch of Italian history, to\r\ncontribute to the advancement of the art, and to facilitate the study of\r\nthe different styles in painting, were the three objects I proposed to\r\nmyself when I began the work which I am now about to lay before the\r\nindulgent reader. My intention was to form a compendious history of all\r\nour schools, in two volumes; adopting, with little variation, Pliny's\r\ndivision of the country into Upper and Lower Italy. It was my design to\r\ncomprehend in the first volume the schools of Lower Italy; because in it\r\nthe reviving arts came earlier to maturity; and in the second to include\r\nthe schools of Upper Italy, which were more tardy in attaining to\r\ncelebrity. The first part of my work appeared at Florence in 1792: the\r\nsecond I was obliged to defer to another opportunity, and the succeeding\r\nyears have so shaken my constitution, that I have scarcely been able to\r\nbring it to a conclusion, even with the assistance of many amanuenses\r\nand correctors of the press.[5] One advantage, however, has been derived\r\nfrom this delay; and that is, a knowledge of the opinion of the public,\r\na tribunal from which no writer can appeal; and I have been thus enabled\r\nto prepare a new edition conformable to its decision.[6] I have\r\nunderstood through various channels, that an additional number of names\r\nand of notices were necessary to afford satisfaction to the public; and\r\nthis I have accomplished, without abandoning my plan of a compendious\r\nhistory. Nor does the Florentine edition on this account become useless:\r\nit will even be preferred by many to that published at Bassano; the\r\ninhabitants, for instance, of Lower Italy will be pleased to possess a\r\nwork on their most illustrious painters, without concerning themselves\r\nabout accounts of other places.\r\n\r\nTo a new work, then, so much more extensive than the former, I prefix a\r\npreface almost entirely new. The plan is not wholly my own, nor\r\naltogether that of others. Richardson[7] suggested that some historian\r\nshould collect the scattered remarks on art, especially on painting, and\r\nshould point out its progress and decline through successive ages. He\r\nhas not even omitted to give us a sketch, which he brought down to the\r\ntime of Giordano. Mengs[8] accomplished the task more perfectly in the\r\nform of a letter, where he judiciously distinguished all the periods of\r\nthe art, and has thus laid the foundations of a more enlarged history.\r\nWere I to follow their example, the chief masters of every school would\r\nbe considered together, and we should be under the necessity of passing\r\nfrom one country to another, according as painting acquired a new lustre\r\nfrom their talents, or was debased by a wrong use of the great example\r\nof those artists. This method might be easily pursued, if the subject\r\nwere to be treated in a general point of view, such as Pliny has\r\nconsidered and transmitted it to posterity; but it is not equally\r\nadapted to the arrangement of a history so fully particular as Italy\r\nseems to require. Besides the styles introduced by the most celebrated\r\npainters, such infinite diversities of a mixed character, often united\r\nwith originality of manner, have arisen in every school, that we cannot\r\neasily reduce them to any particular standard: and the same artists at\r\ndifferent periods, and in different pictures, have adopted styles so\r\nvarious, that at one time they appear imitators of Titian, at another of\r\nRaffaello, or of Correggio. We cannot, therefore, adopt the method of\r\nthe naturalist, who having arranged the vegetable kingdom, for example,\r\nin classes more or less numerous, according to the systems of Tournefort\r\nor of Linnaeus, can easily reduce a plant, wherever it may happen to\r\ngrow, to a particular class, adding a name and description, at once\r\nprecise, characteristic, and permanent. In a complete history it is\r\nnecessary to distinguish each style from every other: nor do I know any\r\nmore eligible method of performing this task, than by composing a\r\nseparate history of each school. In this I follow Winckelmann, the best\r\nhistorian of ancient art in design, who specified as many different\r\nschools as the nations that produced them. A similar plan seems to me to\r\nhave been pursued by Rollin, in his History of Nations, who has thus\r\nbeen enabled to record a prodigious mass of names and events within the\r\ncompass of a few volumes, in the clearest order.\r\n\r\nThe method I follow in treating of each school is analogous to that\r\nprescribed to himself by Sig. Antonio Maria Zanetti,[9] in his _Pittura\r\nVeneziana_, a work of its kind highly instructive, and well arranged.\r\nWhat he has done, in speaking of his own, I have attempted in the other\r\nschools of Italy. I accordingly omit the names of living painters, and\r\ndo not notice every picture of deceased artists, as it would interrupt\r\nthe connexion of the narrative, and would render the work too\r\nvoluminous, but content myself with commending some of their best\r\nproductions. I first give a general character of each school; I then\r\ndistinguish it into three, four, or more epochs, according as its style\r\nunderwent changes with the change of taste, in the same way that the\r\neras of civil history are deduced from revolutions in governments, or\r\nother remarkable events. A few celebrated painters, who have swayed the\r\npublic taste, and given a new tone to the art, are placed at the head of\r\neach epoch; and their style is particularly described, because the\r\ngeneral and characteristic taste of the age has been formed upon their\r\nmodels. Their immediate pupils, and other disciples of the school,\r\nfollow their great masters; and without a repetition of the general\r\ncharacter, reference is made to what each has borrowed, altered, or\r\nadded to the style of the founder of the school, or at most such\r\ncharacter is cursorily noticed. This method, though not susceptible of a\r\nstrict chronological order, is, on account of the connexion of ideas,\r\nmuch better adapted to a history of art than an alphabetic arrangement,\r\nwhich too frequently interrupts the notices of schools and eras; or than\r\nthe method pursued in annals, by which we are often compelled to make\r\nmention of the scholar before the master, should he survive the former;\r\nor that of separate lives, which introduces much repetition, by obliging\r\nthe writer to bestow praises on the pupil for the same style which he\r\nalso commends in the master, and to notice in each individual that which\r\nwas the general character of the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of perspicuity, I have generally separated from historical\r\npainters artists in inferior branches, such as painters of portraits, of\r\nlandscape, of animals, of flowers and of fruit, of sea-pieces, of\r\nperspectives, of drolls, and all who merit a place in such classes. I\r\nhave also taken notice of some arts which are analogous to painting, and\r\nthough they differ from it in the materials employed, or the manner of\r\nusing them, may still be included in the art; for example, engraving of\r\nprints, inlaid and mosaic work, and embroidering tapestry. Vasari,\r\nLomazzo, and several other writers on the fine arts, have mentioned\r\nthem; and I have followed their example; contenting myself with\r\nnoticing, in each of those arts, only what has appeared most worthy of\r\nbeing recorded. Each might be the subject of a separate work; and some\r\nof them have long had their own peculiar historians, and in particular\r\nthe art of engraving. By this method, in which I may boast such great\r\nexamples, I am not without hopes of affording satisfaction to my\r\nreaders. I am, however, more apprehensive in regard to my selection of\r\nartists; the number of whom, whatsoever method is adopted, may to some\r\nappear by far too limited, and to others too greatly extended. But\r\ncriticism will not so readily apply to the names of the most illustrious\r\nartists, whom I have included, nor to those of very inferior character,\r\nwhom I trust I have omitted; except a few that have some claim to be\r\nmentioned, from their connexion with celebrated masters.[10] The\r\naccusation then of having noticed some, and omitted others, will apply\r\nto me only on account of artists of a middle class, that can be neither\r\nwell reckoned among the senate, the equestrian order, nor vulgar herd of\r\npainters; they constitute the class of mediocrity. The adjustment of\r\nlimits is a frequent cause of legal contention; and the subject of art\r\nnow under discussion, may be considered like a dispute concerning\r\nboundaries. It may often admit of doubt whether a particular artist\r\napproaches more nearly to the class of merit or of insignificance; which\r\nis, in other words, whether he should or should not obtain a place in a\r\nhistory of the art. Under such uncertainty, which I have several times\r\nencountered, I have more usually inclined to the side of lenity than of\r\nseverity; especially when the artist has been noticed with a degree of\r\ncommendation by former authors. We ought to bow to public opinion, which\r\nrarely blames us for noticing mediocrity, but frequently for passing it\r\nover in silence. Books on painting abound with complaints against\r\nOrlandi and Guarienti, for their omissions of certain artists. Still\r\nmore frequently are authors censured, when the Guide to a city points\r\nout some altar-piece by a native artist, who is not named in our\r\nDictionaries of Painting. The describers of collections repeat similar\r\ncomplaints in regard to every painting bearing the signature of an\r\nartist whose name appears in no work of art. Collectors of prints do the\r\nsame when they discover the name of some designer, of whom history is\r\nsilent, affixed to an engraving. Thus, were we to consult the opinion of\r\nthe public, the majority would be inclined to recommend copiousness,\r\nrather than to express satisfaction at a more discriminating selection\r\nof names. Almost all artists and amateurs belonging to every city, would\r\nbe desirous that I should commemorate as many of their second rate\r\npainters as possible; and our selection, therefore, in this respect,\r\nnearly resembles the exercise of justice, which is generally applauded\r\nas long as it visits only the dwellings of others, but is cried down by\r\neach individual when it knocks at his own door. Thus a writer who is\r\nbound to observe impartiality towards every city, can scarcely shew\r\ngreat severity to artists of mediocrity in any. This too is not without\r\nreason; for to pass mediocrity in silence may be the study of a good\r\norator, but not the office of a good historian. Cicero himself, in his\r\ntreatise _De claris Oratoribus_, has given a place to less eloquent\r\norators, and it may be observed that, after this example, the literary\r\nhistory of every people does not merely include its most classic\r\nwriters, and those who approached nearest to them; but it adds short and\r\nconcise accounts of authors less celebrated; and in the Iliad, which is\r\na history of the heroic age, there are a few eminent leaders, many\r\nvaliant soldiers, and a prodigious crowd of others, whom the poet has\r\ntransiently noticed. In our case, it is still more incumbent on the\r\nhistorian to give mediocrity a place along with the eminent and most\r\nexcellent. Many books describe that class in terms so vague, and\r\nsometimes so discordant, that to form a proper estimate of their claims,\r\nwe must introduce them among superior artists, as a sort of performers\r\nin third-rate parts. Such, however, I am not solicitous to exhibit very\r\nminutely, more especially when treating of painters in fresco, and\r\ngenerally of other artists, whose works are now unknown in collections,\r\nor add more to the bulk than the ornament of a gallery. Thus also in\r\npoint of number, my work has maintained the character of a compendium:\r\nbut if any of my readers, adopting the rigid maxim of Bellori, that, in\r\nthe fine arts, as in poetry, mediocrity is not to be tolerated,[11]\r\nshould disdain the middle class of artists, he must look for the heads\r\nof schools, and for the most eminent painters: to these he may dedicate\r\nhis attention, and turn his regard from the others like one,\r\n\r\n  \"Cui altra cura stringa e morda\r\n  Che quella di colui che gli e davante.\"[12]\r\n\r\nHaving described my plan, let us next consider the three objects\r\noriginally proposed, of which the first was to present Italy with a\r\nhistory that may prove important to her fame. This delightful country is\r\nalready indebted to Tiraboschi for a history of her literature, but she\r\nis still in want of a history of her arts. The history of painting, an\r\nart in which she is confessedly without a rival, I propose to supply, or\r\nat least to facilitate the attempt. In some departments of literature,\r\nand of the fine arts, we are equalled, or even surpassed by foreigners;\r\nand in others the palm is yet doubtful: but in painting, universal\r\nconsent now yields the triumph to Italian genius, and foreigners are the\r\nmore esteemed in proportion to their approach towards us. It is time\r\nthen, for the honour of Italy, to collect in one point of view, those\r\nobservations on her painting, scattered through upwards of a hundred\r\nvolumes, and to embody them in what Horace terms _series et junctura_;\r\nwithout which the work cannot be pronounced a history. I will not\r\nconceal, that the author of the \"History of Italian Literature\"\r\nabove mentioned, frequently animated me to this undertaking, as a sequel\r\nto his own work. He also wished me to subjoin other anecdotes to those\r\nalready published, and to substitute more authentic documents for the\r\ninaccuracies abounding in our Dictionaries of painting. I have attended\r\nto both these objects. The reader will here find various schools never\r\nhitherto illustrated, and an entire school, that of Ferrara, now first\r\ndescribed from the manuscripts of Baruffaldi and of Crespi; and in other\r\nschools he will often observe names of fresh artists, which I have\r\neither collected from ancient MSS.[13] and the correspondence of my\r\nlearned friends, or deciphered on old paintings. Although such pictures\r\nare confined to cabinets, it cannot prove useless to extend a more\r\nintimate acquaintance with their authors. The reader will also meet with\r\nmany new observations on the origin of painting, and on its diffusion in\r\nItaly, formerly a fruitful subject of debate and contention; and\r\nlikewise here and there with some original reflections on the masters,\r\nto whom various disciples may be traced; a branch of history, the most\r\nuncertain of any. Old writers of respectability often mention Raffaello,\r\nCorreggio, or some other celebrated artist, as the master of a painter,\r\nwithout any better foundation than a similarity of style; just as the\r\ncredulous heathens imagined one hero to be the son of Hercules, because\r\nhe was strong; another of Mercury, because he was ingenious; a third of\r\nNeptune, because he had performed several long voyages. Errors like\r\nthese are easily corrected when they are accompanied by some\r\ninadvertency in the writer; as for instance, where he has not been aware\r\nthat the age of the disciple does not correspond with that of his\r\nsupposed master. Occasionally, however, their detection is attended with\r\nmore difficulty; and in particular when the artist, whose reputation is\r\nwholly founded upon that of his master, represented himself in foreign\r\nparts, as the disciple of men of celebrity, whom he scarcely knew by\r\nsight. Of this we have an example in Agostino Tassi, and more recently\r\nin certain _soidisant_ disciples of Mengs; to whom it scarcely appears\r\nthat he ever so much as said, \"_Gentlemen, how do you do_?\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the reader will find some less obvious notices relating to the\r\nname, the country, and the age of different artists. The deficiency of\r\nour Dictionaries in interesting names, together with their inaccuracy,\r\nare common subjects of complaint. I can excuse the compilers of these\r\nworks; I know how easily we may be misled in regard to names which have\r\nbeen often gathered from vulgar report, or even from authors who differ\r\nin point of orthography, some giving opposite readings of the same name.\r\nBut it is quite necessary that such mistakes should once for all be\r\ncleared up. The index of this work will form a new Dictionary of\r\nPainters, certainly more copious, and perhaps more accurate than usual,\r\nalthough it might be still further improved, especially by consulting\r\narchives and manuscripts.[14]\r\n\r\nThe second object which I had in view was to advance the interests of\r\nthe art as much as lay in my power. It was of old observed that examples\r\nhave a more powerful influence on the arts than any precepts can\r\npossess; and this is particularly true in respect to painting. Whoever\r\nwrites history upon the model of the learned ancients, ought not only to\r\nnarrate events, but to investigate their secret sources and their\r\ncauses. Now these will be here developed, tracing the progress of\r\npainting as it advanced or declined in each school; and these causes\r\nbeing invariable, point out the means of its improvement, by shewing\r\nwhat ought to be pursued and what avoided. Such observations are not of\r\nimportance to the artist alone, but have a reference also to other\r\nindividuals. In the Roman school, during its second epoch, I perceive\r\nthat the progress of the arts invariably depends on certain principles\r\nuniversally adopted in that age, according to which artists worked, and\r\nthe public decided. A general history, by pointing out the best maxims\r\nof art, may contribute considerably to make them known and regarded; and\r\nhence artists can execute, and others approve or direct, on principles\r\nno longer uncertain and questionable, nor deduced from the manner of a\r\nparticular school, but founded on maxims unerring and established, and\r\nstrengthened by the uniform practice of all schools and all ages. We may\r\nadd, that in a history so diversified, numerous examples occur suited to\r\nthe genius of different students, who have often to lament their want of\r\nsuccess from this circumstance alone, that they had neglected to follow\r\nthe path in which nature had destined them to tread. On the influence of\r\nexamples I shall add no more: should any one be desirous also of\r\nprecepts under every school, he will find them given, not indeed by me,\r\nbut by those who have written more ably on the art, and whom I have\r\ndiligently consulted with regard to different masters, as I shall\r\nhereafter mention.\r\n\r\nMy third object was to facilitate an acquaintance with the various\r\nstyles of painting. The artist or amateur indeed, who has studied the\r\nmanner of all ages and of every school, on meeting with a picture can\r\nvery readily assign it, if not to a particular master, at least to a\r\ncertain style, much as antiquarians, from a consideration of the paper\r\nand the characters, are enabled to assign a manuscript to a particular\r\nera; or as critics conjecture the age and place in which an anonymous\r\nauthor flourished, from his phraseology. With similar lights we proceed\r\nto investigate the school and era of artists; and by a diligent\r\nexamination of prints, drawings, and other relics belonging to the\r\nperiod, we at length determine the real author. Much of the uncertainty,\r\nwith regard to pictures, arises from a similitude between the style of\r\ndifferent masters: these I collect together under one head, and remark\r\nin what one differs from the other. Ambiguity often arises from\r\ncomparing different works of the same painter, when the style of some of\r\nthem does not seem to accord with his general manner, nor with the great\r\nreputation he may have acquired. On account of such uncertainty, I\r\nusually point out the master of each artist, because all at the outset\r\nimitate the example offered by their teachers; and I, moreover, note the\r\nstyle formed, and adhered to by each, or abandoned for another manner; I\r\nsometimes mark the age in which he lived, and his greater or less\r\nassiduity in his profession. By an attentive consideration of such\r\ncircumstances, we may avoid pronouncing a picture spurious, which may\r\nhave been painted in old age, or negligently executed. Who, for\r\ninstance, would receive as genuine all the pictures of Guido, were it\r\nnot known that he sometimes affected the style of Caracci, of Calvart,\r\nor of Caravaggio; and at other times pursued a manner of his own, in\r\nwhich, however, he was often very unequal, as he is known to have\r\npainted three or four different pieces in a single day? Who would\r\nsuppose that the works of Giordano were the production of the same\r\nartist, if it were not known that he aspired to diversify his style, by\r\nadopting the manner of various ancient artists? These are indeed well\r\nknown facts, but how many are there yet unnoted that are not unworthy of\r\nbeing related, if we wish to avoid falling into error? Such will be\r\nfound noticed in my work, among other anecdotes of the various masters,\r\nand the different styles.\r\n\r\nI am aware that to become critically acquainted with the diversity of\r\nstyles is not the ultimate object to which the travels and the eager\r\nsolicitude of the connoisseur aspire. His object is to make himself\r\nfamiliar with the handling of the most celebrated masters, and to\r\ndistinguish copies from originals. Happy should I be, could I promise to\r\naccomplish so much! Even they might consider themselves fortunate, who\r\ndedicate their lives to such pursuits, were they enabled to discover any\r\nshort, general, and certain rules for infallibly determining this\r\ndelicate point! Many rely much upon history for the truth. But how\r\nfrequently does it happen that the authority of an historian is cited in\r\nfavour of a family picture, or an altar-piece, the original of which\r\nhaving been disposed of by some of the predecessors, and a copy\r\nsubstituted in its place, the latter is supposed to be a genuine\r\npainting! Others seem to lay great stress on the importance of places,\r\nand hesitate to raise doubts respecting any specimen they find contained\r\nin royal and select galleries, assuming that they really belong to the\r\nartists referred to in the gallery descriptions and catalogues. But here\r\ntoo they are liable to mistake; inasmuch as many private individuals, as\r\nwell as princes, unable to purchase ancient pictures at any price,\r\ncontented themselves with such copies of their imitators as approached\r\nnearest to the old masters. Some indeed were made by professors\r\npurposely despatched by princes in search of them; as in the instance of\r\nRodolph I., who employed Giuseppe Enzo, a celebrated copyist. (See\r\nBoschini, p. 62, and Orlandi, on Gioseffo Ains di Berna.) External\r\nproofs, therefore, are insufficient, without adding a knowledge of\r\ndifferent manners. The acquisition of such discrimination is the fruit\r\nonly of long experience, and deep reflection on the style of each\r\nmaster: and I shall endeavour to point out the manner in which it may be\r\nobtained.[15]\r\n\r\nTo judge of a master we must attend to his design, and this is to be\r\nacquired from his drawings, from his pictures, or, at least, from\r\naccurate engravings after them. A good connoisseur in prints is more\r\nthan half way advanced in the art of judging pictures; and he who aims\r\nat this must study engravings with unremitting assiduity. It is thus his\r\neye becomes familiarized to the artist's method of delineating and\r\nforeshortening the figure, to the air of his heads and the casting of\r\nhis draperies; to that action, that peculiarity of conception, of\r\ndisposing, and of contrasting, which are habitual to his character. Thus\r\nis he, as it were, introduced to the different families of youths, of\r\nchildren, of women, of old men, and of individuals in the vigour of\r\nlife, which each artist has adopted as his own, and has usually\r\nexhibited in his pictures. We cannot be too well versed in such matters,\r\nso minute or almost insensible are the distinctions between the\r\nimitators of one master, (such as Michelangiolo, for example,) who have\r\nperhaps studied the same cartoon, or the same statues, and, as it were,\r\nlearned to write after the same model.\r\n\r\nMore originality is generally to be discovered in colouring, a branch of\r\nthe art formed by a painter rather on his own judgment, than by\r\ninstruction. The amateur can never attain experience in this branch who\r\nhas not studied many pictures by the same master; who has not observed\r\nhis selection of colours, his method of separating, of uniting, and of\r\nsubduing them; what are his local tints, and what the general tone that\r\nharmonizes the colours he employs. This tint, however clear and silvery\r\nin Guido and his followers, bright and golden in Titiano and his school,\r\nand thus of the rest, has still as many modifications as there are\r\nmasters in the art. The same remark extends to middle tints and to\r\nchiaroscuro, in which each artist employs a peculiar method.\r\n\r\nThese are qualities which catch the eye at a distance, yet they will not\r\nalways enable the critic to decide with certainty; whether, for\r\ninstance, a certain picture is the production of Vinci, or Luini, who\r\nimitated him closely; whether another be an original picture by Barocci,\r\nor an exact copy from the hand of Vanni. In such cases judges of art\r\napproach closer to the picture with a determination to examine it with\r\nthe same care and accuracy as are employed in a judicial question, upon\r\nthe recognition of hand-writing. Fortunately for society, nature has\r\ngranted to every individual a peculiar character in this respect, which\r\nit is not easy to counterfeit, nor to mistake for any other person's\r\nwriting. The hand, habituated to move in a peculiar manner, always\r\nretains it: in old age the characters may be more slowly traced, may\r\nbecome more negligent or more heavy; but the form of the letters remains\r\nthe same. So it is in painting. Every artist not only retains this\r\npeculiarity, but one is distinguished by a full charged pencil; another\r\nby a dry but neat finish; the work of one exhibits blended tints, that\r\nof another distinct touches; and each has his own manner of laying on\r\nthe colours:[16] but even in regard to what is common to so many, each\r\nhas a peculiar handling and direction of the pencil, a marking of his\r\nlines more or less waved, more or less free, and more or less studied,\r\nby which those truly skilled from long experience are enabled, after a\r\ndue consideration of all circumstances, to decide who was the real\r\nauthor. Such judges do not fear a copyist, however excellent. He will,\r\nperhaps, keep pace with his model for a certain time, but not always; he\r\nmay sometimes shew a free, but commonly a timid, servile, and meagre\r\npencil; he will not be long able, with a free hand, to keep his own\r\nstyle concealed under the manner of another, more especially in regard\r\nto less important points, such as the penciling of the hair, and in the\r\nfore- and back-grounds of the picture.[17] Certain observations on the\r\ncanvas and the priming ground may sometimes assist inquiry; and hence\r\nsome have endeavoured to attain greater certainty by a chemical analysis\r\nof the colours. Diligence is ever laudable when exerted on a point so\r\nnice as ascertaining the hand-work of a celebrated master. It may\r\nprevent our paying ten guineas for what may not be worth two; or placing\r\nin a choice collection pictures that will not do it credit; while to the\r\ncurious it affords scientific views, instead of creating prejudices that\r\noften engender errors. That mistakes should happen is not surprising. A\r\ntrue connoisseur is still more rare than a good artist. His skill is the\r\nresult of only indirect application; it is acquired amidst other\r\npursuits, and divides the attention with other objects; the means of\r\nattaining it fall to the lot of few; and still fewer practise it\r\nsuccessfully. Among the number of the last I do not reckon myself. By\r\nthis work I pretend not, I repeat it, to form an accomplished\r\nconnoisseur in painting: my object is to facilitate and expedite the\r\nacquisition of such knowledge. The history of painting is the basis of\r\nconnoisseurship; by combining it, I supersede the necessity of referring\r\nto many books; by abbreviating it I save the time and labour of the\r\nstudent; and by arranging it in a proper manner on every occasion, I\r\npresent him with the subject ready prepared and developed before him.\r\n\r\nIt remains, in the last place, that I should give some account of\r\nmyself; of the criticisms that I, who am not an artist, have ventured to\r\npass upon each painter: and, indeed, if the professors of the art had as\r\nmuch leisure and experience in writing as they have ability, every\r\nauthor might resign to them the field. The propriety of technical terms,\r\nthe abilities of artists, and the selection of specimens of art, are\r\nusually better understood, even by an indifferent artist, than by the\r\nlearned connoisseur: but since those occupied in painting have not\r\nsufficient leisure to write, others, assisted by them, may be permitted\r\nto undertake the office.[18]\r\n\r\nBy the mutual assistance which the painter has afforded to the man of\r\nletters, and the man of letters to the artist, the history of painting\r\nhas been greatly advanced. The merits of the best painters are already\r\nso ably discussed that a modern historian can treat the subject\r\nadvantageously. The criticisms I most regard are those that come\r\ndirectly from professors of the art. We meet with few from the pen of\r\nRaphael, of Titian, of Poussin, and of other great masters; such as\r\nexist, however, I regard as most precious, and deserving the most\r\ncareful preservation; for, in general, those who can best perform can\r\nlikewise judge the best. Vasari, Lomazzo, Passeri, Ridolfi, Boschini,\r\nZanotti, and Crespi, require, perhaps, to be narrowly watched in some\r\npassages where they allowed themselves to be surprised by a spirit of\r\nparty: but, on the whole, they have an undoubted right to dictate to us,\r\nbecause they were themselves painters. Bellori, Baldinucci, Count\r\nMalvasia, Count Tassi, and similar writers, hold an inferior rank; but\r\nare not wholly destitute of authority: for though mere _dilettanti_,\r\nthey have collected both the opinions of professors and of the public.\r\nThis will at present suffice, with regard to the historians of the art:\r\nwe shall notice each of them particularly under the school which he has\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nIn pronouncing a criticism upon each artist I have adopted the plan of\r\nBaillet, the author of a voluminous history of works on taste, where he\r\ndoes not so frequently give his own opinion as that of others.\r\nAccordingly, I have collected the various remarks of connoisseurs, which\r\nwere scattered through the pages of history; but I have not always cited\r\nmy authorities, lest I should add too much to the dimensions of my\r\nbook;[19] nor have I regarded their opinion when they seemed to me to\r\nhave been influenced by prejudice. I have availed myself of the\r\nobservations of some approved critics, like Borghini, Fresnoy,\r\nRichardson, Bottari, Algarotti, Lazzarini, and Mengs; with others who\r\nhave rather criticised our painters than written their lives. I have\r\nalso respected the opinions of living critics, by consulting different\r\nprofessors in Italy: to them I have submitted my manuscript; I have\r\nfollowed their advice, especially when it related to design, or any\r\nother department of painting, in which artists are almost the only\r\nadequate judges. I have conversed with many connoisseurs, who, in some\r\npoints, are not less skilful than the professors of the art, and are\r\neven consulted by artists with advantage; as, for instance, on the\r\nsuitableness of the subject, on the propriety of the invention and the\r\nexpression, on the imitation of the antique, on the truth of the\r\ncolouring. Nor have I failed to study the greatest part of the best\r\nproductions of the schools of Italy; and to inform myself in the\r\ndifferent cities what rank their least known painters hold among their\r\nconnoisseurs; persuaded, as I am, that the most accurate opinion of any\r\nartist is formed where the greatest number of his works are to be seen,\r\nand where he is most frequently spoken of by his fellow citizens and by\r\nstrangers. In this way, also, I have been enabled to do justice to the\r\nmerits of several artists who had been passed over, either because the\r\nhistorian of their school had never beheld their productions, or had\r\nmerely met with some early and trivial specimens in one city, being\r\nunacquainted with the more perfect and mature specimens they had\r\nproduced elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my diligence I do not presume to offer this as a work to\r\nwhich much might not be added. It has never happened that a history,\r\nembracing so many objects, is at once produced perfect; though it may\r\ngradually be rendered so. The history earliest in point of time,\r\nbecomes, in the end, the least in authority; and its greatest merit is\r\nin having paved the way to more finished performances. Perfection is\r\nstill less to be expected in a compendium. The reader is here presented\r\nwith the names of many artists and authors; but many others might have\r\nbeen admitted, whom want of leisure or opportunity, but not of respect,\r\nhas obliged us to omit. Here he will find a variety of opinions; but to\r\nthese many others might have been added. There is no man, of whom all\r\nthink alike. Baillet, just before mentioned, is a proof of this, with\r\nregard to writers on literary subjects; and he who thinks the task\r\nworthy of his pains might demonstrate it much more fully with respect to\r\ndifferent painters. Each judges by principles peculiar to himself:\r\nBonarruoti stigmatized as drivelling, Pietro Perugino and Francia, both\r\nluminaries of the art; Guido, if we may credit history, was disapproved\r\nof by Cortona; Caravaggio by Zucchero; Guercino by Guido; and, what\r\nseems more extraordinary, Domenichino by most of the artists who\r\nflourished at Rome, when he painted his finest pictures.[20] Had these\r\nartists written of their rivals they either would have condemned them,\r\nor spoken less favourably of them than unprejudiced individuals. Hence\r\nit is that connoisseurs will frequently be found to approach nearer the\r\ntruth, in forming their estimate, than artists; the former adopt the\r\nimpartial feelings of the public, while the latter allow themselves to\r\nbe influenced by motives of envy or of prejudice. Innumerable similar\r\ndisputes are still maintained concerning several artists, who, like\r\ndifferent kinds of aliment, are found to be disagreeable or grateful to\r\ndifferent palates. To hold the happy mean, exempted from all party\r\nspirit, is as impossible as to reconcile the opinions of mankind, which\r\nare as multifarious as are the individuals of the species.\r\n\r\nAmid such discrepancy of opinion I have judged it expedient to avoid the\r\nmost controverted points; in others, to subscribe to the decision of the\r\nmajority; to allow to each his particular opinion;[21] but not, if\r\npossible, to disappoint the reader, desirous of learning what is most\r\nauthentic and generally received. Ancient writers appear to have pursued\r\nthis plan when treating of the professors of any art, in which they\r\nthemselves were mere amateurs; nor could it arise from any other\r\ncircumstance that Cicero, Pliny, and Quintilian, express themselves upon\r\nthe Greek artists in the same manner. Their opinions coincide, because\r\nthat of the public was unanimous. I am aware that it is difficult to\r\nobtain the opinion of the public concerning the more modern artists, but\r\nit is not difficult with regard to those on whom much has been already\r\nwritten. I am also aware that public opinion accords not at all times\r\nwith truth, because \"it often happens to incline to the wrong side of\r\nthe question.\" This, however, is a rare occurrence in the fine arts,[22]\r\nnor does it militate against an historian who aims more at fidelity of\r\nnarrative, and impartiality of public opinion, than the discussion of\r\nthe relative merit or correctness of tastes.\r\n\r\nMy work is divided into six volumes; and I commence by treating in the\r\ntwo first volumes of that part of Italy, which, through the genius of Da\r\nVinci, Michelangiolo, and Raffaello, became first conspicuous, and first\r\nexhibited a decided character in painting. Those artists were the\r\nornaments of the Florentine and Roman schools, from which I proceed to\r\ntwo others, the Sienese and Neapolitan. About the same time Giorgione,\r\nTiziano, and Coreggio, began to flourish in Italy; three artists, who as\r\nmuch advanced the art of colouring, as the former improved design; and\r\nof these luminaries of Upper Italy I treat in the third and fourth\r\nvolumes; since the number of the names of artists, and the many\r\nadditions to this new impression, have induced me to devote two volumes\r\nto their merits. Then follows the school of Bologna, in which the\r\nattempt was made to unite the excellences of all the other schools: this\r\ncommences the fifth volume; and on account of proximity it is succeeded\r\nby that of Ferrara, and Upper and Lower Romagna. The school of Genoa,\r\nwhich was late in acquiring celebrity, succeeds, and we conclude with\r\nthat of Piedmont, which, though it cannot boast so long a succession of\r\nartists as those of the other states, has merits sufficient to entitle\r\nit to a place in a history of painting. Thus the five most celebrated\r\nschools will be treated of in the order in which they arose; in like\r\nmanner as the ancient writers on painting began with the Asiatic school,\r\nwhich was followed by the Grecian, and this last was subdivided into the\r\nAttic and Sicyonian; to which in process of time succeeded the Roman\r\nschool.[23] The sixth and last volume contains an ample index to the\r\nwhole, quite indispensable to render the work more extensively useful,\r\nand to give it its full advantage. In assigning artists to any school I\r\nhave paid more regard to other circumstances than the place of their\r\nnativity; to their education, their style, their place of residence in\r\nparticular, and the instruction of their pupils: circumstances, indeed,\r\nwhich are sometimes found so blended and confused, that several cities\r\nmay contend for one painter, as they are said to have done for Homer. In\r\nsuch cases I do not pretend to decide; the object of my labours being\r\nonly to trace the vicissitudes of the art in various places, and to\r\npoint out those artists who have exercised an influence over them; not\r\nto determine disputes, unpleasant in themselves, and wholly foreign to\r\nmy undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Algarotti, _Saggio sopra la Pittura_, in the chapter\r\n_Della critica necessaria al Pittore_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For this fault, which the Greeks used to call _Acribia_,\r\nPascoli has been sharply reproved. He has, in fact, informed us which\r\namong the several artists could boast a becoming and proportionate nose,\r\nwhich had it short or long, aquiline or snubbed, very sharp or very\r\nhollow. He most generally observes that such an artist was neither tall\r\nnor large of stature, neither handsome nor plain in his physiognomy; and\r\nwho would have thought it worth his while to inquire about it? The sole\r\nutility that can possibly attend such inquiries is, the chance of\r\ndetecting some impostor, who might attempt to palm upon us for a genuine\r\nportrait the likeness of some other individual. Engravings, however, are\r\nthe best security against similar impositions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In the Magasin Encyclopedique of Paris, (An. viii. tom. iv.\r\np. 63), there is a work in two volumes, edited in the German language at\r\nGottingen, announced as well as commended. The first volume is dated\r\n1798, the second 1801, from the pen of note the learned Sig. Florillo,\r\nthe title of which we insert in the second index. It consists of a\r\nhistory of painting upon the plan of the present one; but there is some\r\nvariation in the order of the schools.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: It was finished in the year 1796, and it is now given, with\r\nvarious additions and corrections throughout. Many churches, galleries,\r\nand pictures, are here mentioned which are no longer in existence; but\r\nthis does not interfere with its truth, inasmuch as the title of the\r\nwork is confined to the before mentioned year. Numerous friends have\r\nlent me their assistance in the completion of this edition, and in\r\nparticular the cavalier Gio. de' Lazara, a gentleman of Padua, who\r\npossesses a rich collection, both in books and MSS., and displays the\r\nutmost liberality in affording others the use of them. To this merit, in\r\nregard to the present work, he has likewise added that of revising and\r\ncorrecting it through the press, a favour which I could not have more\r\nhighly estimated from any other hand, deeply versed as he is in the\r\nhistory of the fine arts.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"Ut enim pictores, et qui signa faciunt, et vero etiam\r\npoetae suum quisque opus a vulgo considerari vult, ut si quid reprehensum\r\nsit a pluribus id corrigatur ... sic aliorum judicio permulta nobis et\r\nfacienda et non facienda, et mutanda et corrigenda sunt.\" Cicero De\r\nOfficiis, ii. c. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Treatise on Painting, tom. ii. p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Opere, tom. ii. p. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: A learned Venetian, skilled in the practice of design and\r\nof painting. He must not be confounded with Antonio Maria Zanetti, an\r\neminent engraver, who revived the art of taking prints from wooden\r\nblocks with more than one colour, which was invented by Ugo da Carpi,\r\nbut afterwards lost. He also wrote works, serviceable to the fine arts;\r\nand several of his letters may be seen in the second volume of _Lettere\r\nPittoriche_. They are subscribed _Antonio Maria Zanetti, q. Erasmo_; but\r\nthis is an error of the editor: it ought to be _q. Girolamo_, to\r\ndistinguish him from the other, who was called _del q. Alessandro_. This\r\nmistake was detected by the accurate Vianelli, in his Diario della\r\nCarriera, p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: An amateur, who happens to be unacquainted with the fact,\r\nthat there were various artists of the same name, as the Vecelli,\r\nBassani, and Caracci, will never become properly acquainted with these\r\nfamilies of painters; neither will he be competent to judge of certain\r\npictures, which only attract the regard of the vulgar, because they\r\ntruly boast the reputation of a great name.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: I do not admit this principle. Horace laid it down for the\r\nart of poetry alone, because it is a faculty that perishes when it\r\nceases to give delight. Architecture, on the other hand, confers vast\r\nutility when it does not please, by presenting us with habitations; and\r\npainting, and sculpture, by preserving the features of men, and\r\nillustrious actions. Besides, let us recollect, that Horace denounces\r\nthe production of inferior verses, because there is not space enough for\r\nthem; \"Non concessere columnae,\" but it is not so with paintings of\r\nmediocrity. In any country Petrarch, Ariosto, and Tasso, may be read,\r\nand he who has never read a poor poet, will write better than if he had\r\nread a hundred. But it is not every one who can boast either in the\r\nhouses or temples of his country, of possessing the works of good\r\nartists; and for purposes of worship or of ornament, the less excellent\r\nones may suffice; wherefore these also produce some advantage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Like one who thinks of some other person than he that is\r\nbefore him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: For the improvement of my latest edition, I am greatly\r\nindebted to the Prince Filippo Ercolani, who, having purchased from the\r\nheirs of Signor Marcello Oretti fifty-two manuscript volumes, which that\r\nindefatigable amateur, in the course of his studies, journeys, and\r\nobservations, had compiled respecting the professors of the fine arts,\r\ntheir eras, and their labours, allowed materials to be drawn from them\r\nfor various notes, by the Sig.

Orlandi in another\r\nletter, tom. ii. p. 318, where it is termed \"a useful work, but so full\r\nof errors, that one can derive no benefit from it without possessing the\r\nbooks there quoted.\" After three editions of this work, a fourth was\r\nprinted in Venice, in 1753, corrected and enlarged by Guarienti, \"but\r\nenough still remains to be done after his additions, even to increase it\r\ntwofold.\" Bottari, Lett. Pitt. tom. iii. p. 353. See also Crespi _Vite\r\nde' Pittori Bolognesi_, p. 50. No one, who has not perused this book,\r\nwould believe how often he defaces Orlandi in presuming to correct him;\r\nmultiplying artists for every little difference with which authors wrote\r\nthe name of the same man. Thus Pier Antonio Torre, and Antonio Torri, are\r\nwith him two different men. Many of the articles, however, added by him,\r\nrelating to artists unknown to P. Orlandi, are useful; so that this\r\nsecond Dictionary ought to be consulted with caution, not altogether\r\nrejected. The last edition, printed at Florence, in two volumes,\r\ncontains the names of many painters, either lately dead, or still\r\nliving, and often of very inferior merit, and on this account is little\r\nnoticed in my history. This Dictionary, moreover, affords little\r\nsatisfaction to the reader concerning the old masters, unless he possess\r\na work printed at Florence in twelve volumes, entitled _Serie degli\r\nUomini piu illustri in Pittura_, to which the articles in it often\r\nrefer. The Dizionario Portatile, by Mr. La Combe, is also a book of\r\nreference, not very valuable to those who look for exact information. We\r\ngive a single instance of his inaccuracy in regard to the elder Palma;\r\nbut our emendations have been chiefly directed towards the writers of\r\nItaly, from whom foreigners have, or ought to have borrowed, in writing\r\nrespecting our artists.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: See Mr. Richardson's _Treatise on Painting_, tom. ii. p.\r\n58; and M.

The elder\r\nPalma and Lorenzo Lotto coloured freshly, and finished their pictures as\r\nhighly as Giovanni Bellini; but they have loaded and overwhelmed them\r\nwith outline and softness in the style of Titiano and Giorgione. Some\r\nothers, as Tintoretto, to a purity of colour not inferior to the artists\r\nabove mentioned, have added a boldness as grand as it is astonishing;\"\r\n&c. Baldinucci, Lett.

He is reproved,\r\nwith regard to Bologna, by Crespi, in Lett. Pittor. tom. vii.; and for\r\nwhat he has said of Genoa, by Ratti, in the lives of the painters of\r\nthat city. Commencing with his preface, they point out the grossest\r\nerrors in Cochin. It is there also observed that his work was\r\ndisapproved of by Watellet, by Clerisseau, and other French connoisseurs\r\nthen living: nor do I believe it would have pleased Filibien, De Piles,\r\nand such masters of the critical art. Italy also, at a later period, has\r\nproduced a book, which aims at overturning the received opinions on\r\nsubjects connected with the fine arts. It is entitled _Arte di vedere\r\nsecondo i principii di Sulzer e di Mengs_. The author, who in certain\r\nperiodical works at Rome, was called the modern Diogenes, has been\r\nhonoured with various confutations. (See _Lettera in Difesa del Cav.\r\nRatti_, p. 11.) Authors like these launch their extravagant opinions,\r\nfor the purpose of attracting the gaze of the world; but men of letters,\r\nif they cannot pass them over in silence, ought not to be very anxious\r\nto gratify their wishes--\"Opinionum commenta delet dies.\" _Cicero._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Of Apelles himself Pliny observes, \"Vulgum diligentiorem\r\njudicem quam se praeferens.\" Examine also Carlo Dati in _Vite de' Pittori\r\nAntichi_, p. 99, where he proves, by authority and examples, that\r\njudgment, in the imitative arts, is not confined to the learned.

His\r\nfather was a physician, and also a man of letters: his mother, a truly\r\nexcellent and pious woman, was allied to the family of the Firmani. How\r\ndeeply sensible the subject of this memoir was of the advantages he\r\nderived, in common with many illustrious characters, from early maternal\r\nprecepts and direction, he has shewn in a beautiful Latin elegy to her\r\nmemory, which appeared in his work, entitled _Inscriptionum et\r\nCarminum_.\r\n\r\nPossessed of a naturally lively and penetrating turn of mind, he began\r\nearly to investigate the merits of the great writers of his own country;\r\nalike in poetry, in history, and in art. His poetical taste was formed\r\non the models of Petrarch and of Dante, and he was accustomed, while yet\r\na child, to repeat their finest passages to his father, an enthusiastic\r\nadmirer of Italy's old poets, who took pride in cultivating the same\r\nfervour in the mind of his son, a fervour of which in more northern\r\nclimates, we can form little idea. His imitations of these early poets,\r\nwhose spirit he first imbibed at the fountain head, before he grew\r\nfamiliar with the corrupt and tasteless compositions of succeeding eras,\r\nare said to have frequently been so bold and striking, as to deceive the\r\npaternal eye. To these, too, he was perhaps mainly indebted for that\r\nenergy of feeling, and solidity of judgment, as well as that richness of\r\nillustration and allusion, which confer attractions upon his most\r\nserious and elaborate works. He was no less intimate with the best\r\npolitical and literary historians at an early age; with Machiavelli,\r\nDavila, and Guicciardini; with Muratori and Tiraboschi; whose respective\r\ncompositions he was destined to rival in the world of art.\r\n\r\nLanzi's first studies were pursued in the Jesuits' College at Fermo,\r\nwhere an Italian Canzone, written in praise of the Beata Vergine, is\r\nsaid to have acquired for him, as a youth of great promise, the highest\r\ndegree of regard. Under the care of his spiritual instructor, father\r\nRaimondo Cunich, Lanzi likewise became deeply versed in all the\r\nexcellences of classical literature, not as a vain parade of words and\r\nsyllables; for along with the technical skill of the scholar, he imbibed\r\nthe spirit of the ancient writers. In his succeeding philosophical and\r\nmathematical studies he was assisted by Father Boscovich, one of the\r\nfirst mathematicians of his day. Thus to a keen and fertile intellect,\r\nanimated by enthusiasm for true poetry and the beauties of art, was\r\nadded that regular classical and scientific learning, inducing a love of\r\norder and of truth, capable of applying the clear logic derived from\r\nEuclid to advantage, in subjects of a less tangible and demonstrative\r\nnature. The value of such preliminary acquirements to the examination of\r\nantiquarian and scientific remains, which can only be conducted on\r\nuncertain data and a calculation of possibilities, as in ancient\r\nspecimens of art, can bear no question; and of this truth Lanzi was\r\nfully aware. To feel rightly, to reason clearly, to decide upon\r\nprobabilities, to distinguish degrees, resemblances, and differences,\r\ncomparing and weighing the whole with persevering accuracy; these were\r\namong the essentials which Lanzi conceived requisite to prepare a writer\r\nupon works of art.\r\n\r\nThese qualities, too, will be found finely relieved and elevated by\r\nfrequent and appropriate passages of eloquent feeling; flowing from that\r\nsincere veneration for his subject, and that love which may be termed\r\nthe religion of the art to which he became so early attached. How\r\nintimately such a spirit is connected with the best triumphs of the art\r\nof painting, is seen in the angelic faces of Da Vinci, of Raffaello, and\r\nCoreggio; and the same enthusiasm must have been felt by a true critic,\r\nsuch as Lanzi. Far, however, from impeding him in the acquisition of his\r\nstores of antiquarian knowledge, and in his scientific arrangements, his\r\nenthusiasm conferred upon him only an incredible degree of diligence and\r\ndespatch. He was at once enabled to decipher the age and character, to\r\narrange in its proper class, and to give the most exact description of\r\nevery object of art which passed under his review.\r\n\r\nLanzi thus came admirably prepared to his great task, one of the most\r\ncomplete models of sound historical composition, of which the modern age\r\ncan boast. It was written in the full maturity of his powers; no hasty\r\nor isolated undertaking, it followed a series of other excellent\r\ntreatises, all connected with some branches of the subject, and\r\nfurnishing materials for his grand design. Circumstances further\r\ncontributed to promote his views. Shortly after the dissolution of the\r\norder of Jesuits, to which he belonged, he was recommended by his friend\r\nFabroni, prior of the church of S. Lorenzo, to the grand duke Leopold of\r\nFlorence, who, in 1775, appointed him to the care of his cabinet of\r\nmedals and gems, in the gallery of Florence. This gave rise to one of\r\nhis first publications, entitled, _A Description of the Florentine\r\nGallery_, which he sent in 1782 to the same friend, Angiolo Fabroni,\r\nthen General Provveditore of the Studio at Pisa, and who conducted the\r\ncelebrated Literary Journal of that place, in which Lanzi's DESCRIPTION\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nHis next dissertation, still more enriched with antiquarian illustration\r\nand research, was his Essay on the _Ancient Italian dialects_, which\r\ncontains a curious account of old Etruscan monuments, and the ducal\r\ncollection of classical vases and urns. This was followed by his\r\n_Preliminary Notices respecting the Sculpture of the Ancients, and their\r\nvarious Styles_, put forth in the year 1789, in which he pursues the\r\nsame plan which he subsequently perfected in the history before us, of\r\nallotting to each style its respective epochs, to each epoch its\r\npeculiar characters, these last being exemplified by their leading\r\nprofessors, most celebrated in history. He farther adduces examples of\r\nhis system as he proceeds, from the various cabinets of the Royal\r\nMuseum, which he explains to the reader as a part of his chief design in\r\nillustrating them. He enters largely into the origin and character of\r\nthe Etruscan School, and examines very fully the criticisms, both on\r\nancient and Italian art, by Winckelmann and Mengs.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of these publications, the Grand Duke, entertaining a\r\nhigh opinion of Lanzi's judgment, was in the habit of consulting him\r\nbefore he ventured to add any new specimens to his cabinet of\r\nantiquities. He was also entrusted with a fresh arrangement of some new\r\ncabinets belonging to the gallery, which together with the latter, he\r\nfinally completed, on a system which it is said never fails to awaken\r\nthe admiration of all scientific visitors at Florence. During this task,\r\nhis attention had been particularly directed to the interpretation of\r\nthe monuments and Etruscan inscriptions contained in the ducal gallery,\r\nwhich, together with the ancient Tuscan, the Umbrian, and other obsolete\r\ndialects, soon grew familiar to him, and led to the composition of his\r\ncelebrated _Essay upon the Tuscan Tongue_. For the purpose of more\r\ncomplete research and illustration, he obtained permission from the duke\r\nto visit Rome, in order to consult the museums, and prepare the way for\r\nhis essay, which he published there in 1789; a work of immense erudition\r\nand research.\r\n\r\nIt was here Lanzi first appeared as the most profound antiquarian of\r\nmodern Italy, by his successful explanation of some ancient Etruscan\r\ninscriptions and remains of art, which had baffled the skill of a number\r\nof his most distinguished countrymen. Upon presenting it to the grand\r\nduke, after his return from Rome, Lanzi was immediately appointed his\r\nhead antiquary and director of the Florentine gallery; while the city of\r\nGubbio raised him to the rank of their first patrician order, on account\r\nof his successful elucidation of the famous Eugubine Tables. In one of\r\nhis _Dissertations upon a small Tuscan Urn_, he triumphantly refuted\r\nsome charges which had been invidiously advanced against him, and\r\ndefended his principles of antiquarian illustration by retorting the\r\ncharge of fallacy upon his adversaries.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1790, Lanzi, at the request of the Gonfaloniere and priors\r\nof Monte dell'Olino, published an inquiry into the _Condition and Site\r\nof Pausula, an ancient City of Piceno_; said to be written with\r\nsurprising ingenuity, yet with equal fairness; uninfluenced by any\r\nprejudices arising from national partiality, or from the nature of the\r\ncommission with which he had been honoured. This was speedily followed\r\nby a much more important undertaking, connected with the prosecution of\r\nhis great design, which it would appear he had already for some time\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of his travels through Italy in pursuit of\r\nantiquities, he had carefully collected materials for a general History\r\nof Painting, which was meant to comprize, in a compendious form,\r\nwhatever should be found scattered throughout the numerous authors who\r\nhad written upon the art. These materials, as well as the work itself,\r\nhad gradually grown upon his hands, as might be expected from a man so\r\nlong accustomed to method, to criticism, to perspicuity; in short, to\r\nevery quality requisite in the philosophical treatment of a great\r\nsubject. The artists and literati of Italy, then, were not a little\r\nsurprised at the appearance of the first portion of the _Storia\r\nPittorica_, comprehending _Lower Italy; or the Florentine, Sienese,\r\nRoman, and Neapolitan Schools, reduced to a compendious and methodical\r\nform_, _adapted to facilitate a knowledge of Professors and of their\r\nStyles, for the lovers of the art_. It was dedicated to the grand\r\nduchess Louisa Maria of Bourbon, in a style, observes the Cav. Bossi,\r\n\"which recalls to mind the letters of Pliny to Trajan, composed with\r\nmingled dignity and respect; with genuine feeling, and with true, not\r\nimaginary, commendations.\" _Elogio_, p. 127.\r\n\r\nBut the unfeigned pleasure and admiration expressed in the world of\r\nliterature and art, on being presented with the Pictorial History of\r\nLower Italy, was almost equalled by its disappointment at the delay\r\nexperienced with regard to the appearance of the second part; and which\r\nit was feared would never see the light. Lanzi's state of health had,\r\nsome time subsequent to 1790, been very precarious; and he suffered\r\nseverely from a distressing complaint,[25] which frequently interrupted\r\nhis travels in which he was then engaged, collecting further materials\r\nfor his History of Painting in Upper Italy. While thus employed, on his\r\nreturn from Genoa in December, 1793, he experienced a first attack of\r\napoplexy, as he was passing the mountains of Massa and Carrara. After\r\nhis recovery, and return to Florence, he was advised in the ensuing\r\nspring to visit the baths of Albano, which being situated near Bassano,\r\nafforded him an opportunity of superintending the publication of his\r\nhistory, in the Remondini Press, and on a more extensive scale than he\r\nhad at first contemplated. He likewise obtained permission from the\r\ngrand duke Leopold to absent himself, during some time, from his charge\r\nat Florence, in September, 1793. The first portion of his labours he\r\nconceived to be too scanty in point of names and notices to satisfy\r\npublic taste, so that upon completing the latter part upon a more full\r\nand extensive scale, he gave a new edition of that already published,\r\nvery considerably altered and augmented.\r\n\r\nTo these improvements he invariably contributed, both in notes and text,\r\nat every subsequent edition, a number of which appeared in the course of\r\na few years, until the work attained a degree of completeness and\r\ncorrectness seldom bestowed upon labours of such incredible difficulty\r\nand extent. The last which received the correction and additions of the\r\nauthor was published at Bassano, in the year 1809.\r\n\r\nThat a work upon such a scale was a great desideratum, no less to Italy\r\nthan to the general world of art, would appear evident from the\r\ncharacter of the various histories and accounts of painting which had\r\npreceded it. They are rather valuable as records, than as real criticism\r\nor history; as annals of particular characters and productions derived\r\nfrom contemporary observation, than as sound and enlightened views, and\r\na dispassionate estimate of individual merits. Full of errors, idle\r\nprejudices, and discussions foreign to the subject, a large portion of\r\ntheir pages is taken up in vapid conceits, personal accusations, and\r\npuerile reasoning, destitute of method.\r\n\r\nThe work of Lanzi, on the other hand, as it is well remarked by the Cav.\r\nBoni, observes throughout the precept of the _serie et junctura_ of\r\nHorace. It brings into full light the leading professors of the art,\r\nexhibits at due distance those of the second class, and only glances at\r\nmediocrity and inferiority of character, insomuch as to fill up the\r\ngreat pictoric canvas with its just lights and shades. The true causes\r\nof the decline and revival of the art at certain epochs are pointed out,\r\nwith those that contribute to preserve the fine arts in their happiest\r\nlustre; in which, recourse to examples more than to precepts is strongly\r\nrecommended. The best rules are unfolded for facilitating the study of\r\ndifferent manners, some of which are known to bear a resemblance, though\r\nby different hands, and others are opposed to each other, although\r\nadopted by the same artist; a species of knowledge highly useful at a\r\nperiod when the best productions are eagerly sought after at a high\r\nrate. It is a history, in short, worthy of being placed at the side of\r\nthat on the Literature of Italy by Tiraboschi, who having touched upon\r\nthe fine arts at the outset of his labours, often urged his ancient\r\nfriend and colleague to dilate upon a subject in every way so flattering\r\nto the genius of Italy; to Italy which, however rivalled by other\r\nnations in science and in literature, stands triumphant and alone in its\r\ncreative mind of art.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, difficult to convey a just idea of a work composed upon\r\nso enlarged and complete a scale; which embraces a period of about six\r\ncenturies, and fourteen Italian schools, but treated with such rapidity\r\nand precision, as to form in itself a compendium of whatever we meet\r\nwith in so many volumes of guides, catalogues, descriptions of churches\r\nand palaces, and in so many lives of artists throughout the whole of\r\nItaly. (pp. 130-1.)\r\n\r\nIt is known that Richardson expressed a wish that some historian would\r\ncollect these scattered accounts relating to the art of painting, at the\r\nsame time noting down its progress and decline in every age, a\r\ndesideratum which Mengs in part supplied in one of his letters, briefly\r\nmarking down all the respective eras. Upon this plan, as far as regarded\r\nVenetian painting, Zanetti had partially proceeded; but the general\r\nsurvey, in its perfect form, of the whole of the other schools, was\r\ndestined to be completed by the genius of Lanzi. Here he first gives the\r\ngeneral character of each, distinguishing its particular epochs,\r\naccording to the alterations in taste which it underwent. A few artists\r\nof distinguished reputation, whose influence gave a new impulse and new\r\nlaws to the art, stand at the head of each era, which they may be said\r\nto have produced, with a full description of their style. To these great\r\nmasters, their respective pupils are annexed, with the progress of their\r\nschool, referring to such as may have more or less added to, or altered\r\nthe manner of their prototype. For the sake of greater perspicuity, the\r\npainters of history are kept distinct from the artists in inferior\r\nbranches; among whom are classed portrait and landscape painters, those\r\nof animals, of flowers, of fruits, &c. Nor are such as bear an affinity\r\nto the art, like engraving, inlaying, mosaic work, and embroidery,\r\nwholly excluded. Being doubtful whether he should make mention of those\r\nartists who belong neither to the senatorial, the equestrian, nor the\r\npopular order of the pictorial republic, and have no public\r\nrepresentation, such as the names of mediocrity; Lanzi finally decided\r\nto introduce them among their superiors, like third-rate actors, whose\r\nfigures may just be seen, in order to preserve the entireness of the\r\nstory. To this he was farther induced by the general appearance of their\r\nnames in the various dictionaries, guides, and descriptions of cities\r\nand of galleries; and by the example of Homer, Cicero, and most great\r\nwriters; Homer himself commemorating, along with the wise and brave also\r\nthe less valiant--the fools and the cowards. (_Elogio_, pp. 129, 130,\r\n131.)\r\n\r\nAfter having resided during a considerable period at Bassano, occupied\r\nin the superintendence of the first edition of his great work, Lanzi\r\nfound himself compelled to retire to Udine, in 1796, from the more\r\nimmediate scene of war; a war which subsequently involved other cities\r\nof Italy in its career. From Udine he shortly returned to Florence,\r\nwhere he again resumed his former avocations in the ducal gallery, about\r\nthe period of the commencement of the Bourbon government.\r\n\r\nLanzi's next literary undertaking was three Dissertations upon _Ancient\r\npainted Vases, commonly called Etruscan_; and he subsequently published\r\na very excellent and pleasing work, entitled, _Aloisii Lanzii\r\nInscriptionum et Carminum Libri Tres_: works which obtained for him the\r\nfavourable notice of the Bourbon court. Nor was he less distinguished by\r\nthat of the new French dynasty, which shortly obtained the ascendancy\r\nthroughout all Italy, as well as at Florence, and by which Lanzi was\r\nappointed President of the Cruscan Academy.\r\n\r\nAmong Lanzi's latest productions may be classed his edition and\r\ntranslations of Hesiod; entitled _I Lavori, e le Giornate di Esiodo\r\nAscreo opera con L. Codici riscontrata, emendata la versione latina,\r\naggiuntavi l'Italiana in Terze Rime con annotazioni_. In this he had\r\nbeen engaged as far back as the year 1785, and it had been then\r\nannounced in a beautiful edition of Hesiod, translated into Latin by\r\nCount Zamagua.\r\n\r\nThe list will here close with his _Opere Sacre_, sacred treatises,\r\nproduced on a variety of occasions, and on a variety of spiritual\r\nsubjects. One of these was upon the Holy Sacrament, entitled, _Il divoto\r\ndel SS. Sacramento istruito nella pratica_ _di tal devozione_. In truth,\r\nLanzi was a good Christian, and may be ranked in the number of that\r\ngreat and honoured band of Christian philosophers, who like Newton,\r\nLocke, and Paley, have triumphantly opposed the whole strength of their\r\nmighty intellect, and vast reach of their reasoning powers to the\r\nspecious and witty, but less powerful and argumentative genius of\r\nGibbon, of Hume, and of Voltaire. Nor was the conviction of these great\r\ntruths in the mind of Lanzi the result of sickness and misfortunes, or\r\nsombre reflections in the decline of life. Great as was the reputation\r\nhe had acquired by his valuable labours, he was often known sincerely to\r\ndeclare, among his private friends, that he would willingly renounce all\r\nkind of literary honours for the pleasure of being assured, that his\r\nsacred works had in any degree promoted the cause of Christianity.\r\n\r\nShortly after the last edition of the History now before us, which he\r\nhad personally superintended, though at a very advanced age, in the year\r\n1809, at Bassano, Lanzi's health began rapidly to decline, and he\r\nprepared with perfect composure to meet the termination of his earthly\r\ncareer. He had already attained his seventy-eighth year; but his mind\r\npreserved its usual tone and vigour, though he could with difficulty\r\npace his apartment. He wrote letters, and even pursued his beloved\r\nstudies on the day of his decease, which took place on Sunday, the 30th\r\nof March, 1810, occasioned by a fresh attack of apoplexy. For this he\r\nhad long been prepared, and only the preceding evening had taken an\r\naffectionate leave of his friends and domestics, thanking the Cav. Boni\r\nfor his kindness in continuing so long to mount his staircase to visit\r\nan old man.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: It may be proper to observe, that the materials of the\r\nbiographical sketch here offered to the public, are extracted from an\r\nextremely pleasing and popular tribute to the memory of Lanzi, of very\r\ngeneral repute in Italy, from the pen of his intimate friend and\r\nassociate, the Cavalier Bossi, himself a man of singular merit and\r\nacquirements, whose _Elogio_ upon his distinguished countryman has\r\ndeservedly been added to the recent editions of his invaluable history.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Repeated attacks of strangury which often threatened his\r\nlife, unless he obtained instant relief.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF PAINTING\r\n\r\n  IN\r\n\r\n  LOWER ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  FLORENTINE SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EPOCH I.\r\n\r\n  _Origin of the revival of Painting_--_Association and\r\n  methods of the old Painters_--_Series of Tuscan Artists\r\n  before the time of Cimabue and Giotto._\r\n\r\n  SECT. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat there were painters in Italy, even during the rude ages, is\r\nattested not only by historians,[26] but by several pictures which have\r\nescaped the ravages of time; Rome retains several ancient specimens.[27]\r\nPassing over her cemeteries, which have handed down to us a number of\r\nChristian monuments, part in specimens of painted glass, scattered\r\nthrough our museums, and part in those of parietal histories, or walled\r\nmosaic, it will be sufficient to adduce two vast works, unrivalled by\r\nany others, that I know of, in Italy. The first is the series of the\r\nPopes, which in order to prove the succession of the papal chair, from\r\nthe prince of the Apostles down to the time of St. Leo, this last holy\r\npontiff caused to be painted; a work of the fifth century, which was\r\nsubsequently continued until our own times. The second is the decoration\r\nof the whole church of San Urbano, where there are several evangelical\r\nacts represented on the walls, along with some histories of the Titular\r\nSaint and St. Cecilia, a production which, partaking in nothing either\r\nof the Greek lineaments or style of drapery, may be attributed more\r\njustly to an Italian pencil, which has subscribed the date of 1011.[28]\r\nMany more might be pointed out, existing in different cities; as for\r\ninstance the picture at Pesara, of the patron saints of the city,\r\nillustrated by the celebrated Annibale Olivieri, which is earlier than\r\nthe year 1000; those in the vaults of the cathedral at Aquileja,[29] the\r\npicture at Santa Maria Primerana at Fiesole, which seems the work of\r\nthat or the succeeding age;[30] and the picture at Orvieto which was\r\nformerly known by the name of S. Maria Prisca, but is now generally\r\ncalled S. Brizio.[31] I say nothing of the figures of the virgin\r\nformerly ascribed to St. Luke, and now supposed to be the production of\r\nthe eleventh or twelfth century, as I shall have to treat of them at the\r\nopening of the third book. The painters of those times were, however, of\r\nlittle repute; they produced no illustrious scholars, no work worthy of\r\nmarking an era. The art had gradually degenerated into a kind of\r\nmechanism, which, after the models afforded by the Greek workers in\r\nmosaic employed in the church of St. Mark, at Venice,[32] invariably\r\nexhibited the same legends, in which nature appeared distorted rather\r\nthan represented. It was not till after the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury that any thing better was attempted; and the improvement of\r\nsculpture was the first step towards the formation of a new style.\r\n\r\nThe honour of this is due to the Tuscans; a nation that from very remote\r\nantiquity disseminated the benign light of art and learning throughout\r\nItaly; but it more especially belongs to the people of Pisa. They taught\r\nartists how to shake off the trammels of the modern Greeks, and to adopt\r\nthe ancients for their models. Barbarism had not only overwhelmed the\r\narts, but even the maxims necessary for their re-establishment. Italy\r\nwas not destitute of fine specimens of Grecian and Roman sculpture; but\r\nshe had long been without an artist who could appreciate their value,\r\nmuch less attempt to imitate them. Little else was executed in those\r\ndark ages but some rude pieces of sculpture, such as what remains in the\r\ncathedral of Modena, in San Donato at Arezzo, in the Primaziale at\r\nPisa,[33] and in some other churches where specimens are preserved on\r\nthe doors or in the interior. Niccola Pisano was the first who\r\ndiscovered and pursued the true path. There were, and still are, some\r\nancient sarcophagi in Pisa, especially that which inclosed the body of\r\nBeatrice, mother of the Countess Matilda, who died in the eleventh\r\ncentury. A chase, supposed to represent that of Hippolytus, is\r\nsculptured on it in basso relievo, which must be the production of a\r\ngood school; being a subject which has been often delineated by the\r\nancients on many urns still extant at Rome.[34] This was the model which\r\nNiccola selected, from this he formed a style which participated of the\r\nantique, especially in the heads and the casting of the drapery; and\r\nwhen exhibited in different Italian cities \"it inspired artists with a\r\nlaudable emulation to apply to sculpture more assiduously than they had\r\nbefore done,\" as we are informed by Vasari. Niccola did not attain to\r\nwhat he aspired. The compositions are sometimes crowded, the figures are\r\noften badly designed, and shew more diligence than expression. His name,\r\nhowever, will always mark an era in the history of design, because he\r\nfirst led artists into the true path by the introduction of a better\r\nstandard. Reform in any branch of study invariably depends on some rule,\r\nwhich, promulgated and adopted by the schools, gradually produces a\r\ngeneral revolution in opinion, and opens a new field to the exertions of\r\na succeeding age.\r\n\r\nAbout 1231, he sculptured at Bologna the urn of San Domenico, and from\r\nthis, as a remarkable event, he was named \"_Niccola of the Urn_.\" He\r\nafterwards executed in a much superior style, the Last Judgment, for the\r\ncathedral of Orvieto, and the pulpit in the church of San Giovanni, at\r\nPisa; works that demonstrate to the world that design, invention, and\r\ncomposition, received from him a new existence. He was succeeded by\r\nArnolfo Florentino, his scholar, the sculptor of the tomb of Boniface\r\nVIII. in San Pietro at Rome; and by his son Giovanni, who executed the\r\nmonuments of Urban IV. and of Benedict IX. in Perugia. He afterwards\r\ncompleted the great altar of San Donato, at Arezzo, the cost of which\r\nwas thirty thousand gold florins; besides many other works which remain\r\nin Naples and in several cities of Tuscany. Andrea Pisano was his\r\nassociate, and probably also his disciple in Perugia, who, after\r\nestablishing himself in Florence, ornamented with statues the cathedral\r\nand the church of San Giovanni in that city; and in twenty-two years\r\nfinished the great gate of bronze \"to which we are indebted for all that\r\nis excellent, difficult, or beautiful in the other two, which are the\r\nworkmanship of succeeding artists.\" He was, in fact, the founder of that\r\ngreat school that successively produced Orcagna, Donatello, and the\r\ncelebrated Ghiberti, who fabricated those gates for the same church,\r\nwhich Michelagnolo pronounced worthy to form the entrance of Paradise.\r\nAfter Andrea, we may notice Giovanni Balducci, of Pisa, whose era,\r\ncountry, and style, all lead us to suppose him one of the same school.\r\nHe was an excellent artist, and was employed by Castruccio, Lord of\r\nLucca, and by Azzone Visconti, Prince of Milan; where he flourished, and\r\nleft, among other monuments of his art, the tomb of San Pietro Martire,\r\nat S. Eustorgio, which is so highly praised by Torre, by Lattuada, and\r\nby various other learned illustrators of Milanese antiquities.[35] Two\r\neminent artists, natives of Siena, proceeded from the school of Gio.\r\nPisano, namely, the two brothers, Agnolo and Agostino, who are greatly\r\ncommended by Vasari as improvers of the art. Whoever has seen the\r\nsepulchre of Guido, bishop of Arezzo, which is decorated with an\r\ninfinity of statues and basso-relievos, representing passages of his\r\nlife, will not only find reason to admire in them the design, which was\r\nthe work of Giotto, but the execution of the sculpture. The brothers\r\nalso executed many of their own designs in Orvieto, in Siena, and in\r\nLombardy, where they brought up several pupils, who for a long period\r\npursued their manner, and diffused it over Italy.\r\n\r\nTo the improvement of sculpture succeeded that of mosaic, through the\r\nefforts of another Tuscan, belonging to the order of minor friars, named\r\nFra Jacopo, or Fra Mino da Turrita, from a place in the territory of\r\nSiena. It is not known whether he was instructed in his art by the\r\nRomans or by the Greek workers in mosaic,[36] but it is well ascertained\r\nthat he very far surpassed them. On examining what remains of his works\r\nin Santa Maria Maggiore at Rome, one can hardly be persuaded that it is\r\nthe production of so rude an age, did not history constrain us to\r\nbelieve it. It appears probable that he took the ancients for his\r\nmodels, and deduced his rules from the more chaste specimens of mosaic,\r\nstill remaining in several of the Roman churches, the design of which is\r\nless crude, the attitudes less forced, and the composition more skilful,\r\nthan were exhibited by the Greeks who ornamented the church of San\r\nMarco, at Venice. Mino surpassed them in every thing. From 1225, when he\r\nexecuted, however feebly, the mosaic of the tribune of the church of San\r\nGiovanni, at Florence, he was considered at the head of the living\r\nartists in mosaic.[37] He merited this praise much more by his works at\r\nRome, and it appears that he long maintained his reputation. Vasari has\r\nnot been sufficiently just to the fame of Turrita, in noticing him only\r\ncasually in the life of Tafi, but the verses he recites, and the\r\ncommissions he mentions, demonstrate how greatly Turrita was esteemed by\r\nhis contemporaries. It is maintained that he was also a painter, but\r\nthis is a mistake which will be cleared up in the Sienese school, and\r\nboth there and elsewhere I shall question the authority of any author\r\nwho either greatly commends or underrates him.\r\n\r\nFrom a deficiency of _specimens_, like those above recorded, painting\r\nlong remained in a more rude state than mosaic, and was very far behind\r\nsculpture. But we must not imagine, that at the birth of Cimabue, in\r\n1240, the race of artists was entirely extinct, as erroneously asserted\r\nby Vasari: this must be deemed an exaggeration, for he himself has\r\nrecounted several sculptors, architects, and painters then living; and\r\nthe general scope of his less cautious expressions, against which so\r\nmany writers have inveighed, and still continue to declaim, favours this\r\nopinion. I shall be constrained to advert, in almost every book, to\r\ntheir accusations, and to produce the names of the artists who then\r\nlived. I shall commence with those who then flourished in Tuscany. The\r\ncity of Pisa, at this time, had not only painters, but a school for each\r\nof the fine arts[38]. The distinguished Signor Morrona, who has\r\nillustrated the Pisan antiquities, deduces its origin immediately from\r\nGreece. The Pisans, already very powerful by sea and land, having\r\nresolved in 1063 to erect the vast fabric of their cathedral, had drawn\r\nthither artists in miniature, and other painters, at the same time with\r\nBuschetto the architect, and these men educated pupils for the city. The\r\nGreeks at that time were but ill qualified to instruct, for they knew\r\nlittle. Their first pupils in Pisa seem to have been a few anonymous\r\nartists, some of whose miniatures and rude paintings are still in\r\nexistence. A parchment, containing the _exultet_, as usually sung on\r\nSabbato Santo, is in the cathedral, and we may here and there observe,\r\npainted on it, figures in miniature, with plants and animals: it is a\r\nrelique of the early part of the twelfth century, yet a specimen of art\r\nnot altogether barbarous. There are likewise some other paintings of\r\nthat century in the same cathedral, containing figures of our Lady, with\r\nthe holy infant on her right arm: they are rude, but the progress of the\r\nsame school may be traced from them to the time of Giunta. This artist\r\nlately received a fine eulogium, among other illustrious Pisans, from\r\nSignor Tempesta, and he was fully entitled to it from the more early\r\nhistorians. His country possesses none of his undoubted pictures, except\r\na crucifixion with his name, which is believed to be among his earliest\r\nproductions, a print from which may be found in the third volume of\r\n_Pisa Illustrata_. He executed better pictures in Assisi, where he was\r\ninvited to paint by Frat' Elia di Cortona, superior of the Minori, about\r\nthe year 1230. From thence we are furnished with notices of his\r\neducation, which is thus described by P. Angeli, the Historian of that\r\ncathedral: \"Juncta Pisanus ruditer a Graecis instructus, primus ex\r\nItalis, artem apprehendit circa An. Sal. 1210.\" In the church of the\r\nAngioli there is a better preserved work of the same master; it is a\r\ncrucifixion, painted on a wooden cross; on the lateral edges and upper\r\nsurface of which our Lady is represented, with two other half-length\r\nfigures, and underneath the remains of an inscription are legible, which\r\nhaving copied on the spot, I do not hesitate to publish with its\r\ndeficiencies now supplied:\r\n\r\n  _Iv_nTA PISAnUS\r\n  _Ivn_TINI ME _Fecit_.\r\n\r\nI supply _Juntini_, because Signor da Morrona asserts,[39] that about\r\nthis time, a _Giunta da Giuntino_ is mentioned in the records of Pisa,\r\nwhom by the aid of the _Assisi_ inscription, I conjecture to be the\r\npainter we have now under notice. The figures are considerably less than\r\nlife; the design is dry, the fingers excessively long, but these are\r\n_vitia non hominum sed temporum_; in short, this piece shews a knowledge\r\nof the naked figure, an expression of pain in the heads, and a\r\ndisposition of the drapery, greatly superior to the efforts of the\r\nGreeks, his contemporaries. The handling of his colours is strong,\r\nalthough the flesh inclines to that of bronze; the local tints are\r\njudiciously varied, the chiaroscuro even shews some art, and the whole\r\nis not inferior, except in the proportions, to crucifixions with similar\r\nhalf figures usually ascribed to Cimabue. He painted at Assisi another\r\ncrucifixion, which is now lost, to which may be added, a portrait of\r\nFrat' Elia, with this inscription, \"_F. Helias fecit fieri. Jesu Christe\r\npie miserere precantis Heliae. Juncta Pisanus me pinxit, An. D. 1236.\r\nIndit. IX._\" The inscription has been preserved by P. Wadingo in his\r\nannals of the Franciscan order for that year, and the historian\r\ndescribes the crucifixion as _affabre pictum_. The fresco works of\r\nGiunta were executed in the great church of the Franciscans, and\r\naccording to Vasari he was there assisted by certain Greeks. Some busts\r\nand history pieces still remain in the gallery and the contiguous\r\nchapels, among which is the crucifixion of San Pietro, noticed in the\r\n_Etruria Pittrice_. Some believe that those paintings have been here and\r\nthere injudiciously retouched, and this may serve to excuse the drawing,\r\nwhich may have been altered in many places, but the feebleness of the\r\ncolouring cannot be denied. When they are compared with what Cimabue\r\nexecuted there about forty years afterwards, it seems that Giunta was\r\nnot sufficiently forcible in this species of painting; perhaps he might\r\nhave improved, but he is not mentioned after 1235; and it is conjectured\r\nthat he died while yet a young man, at a distance from his native\r\ncountry. I am induced to believe so from observing, that Giunta di\r\nGiuntino is noticed in the records of Pisa, in the early part of that\r\ncentury, but not afterwards; and that Cimabue was sent for to paint the\r\naltar-piece and portrait of San Francesco of Pisa, about the year 1265,\r\nbefore he went to Assisi. It is more likely that Giunta would have\r\nexecuted this, had he returned home from that city, where he had seen\r\nand perhaps painted the portrait of the Holy Father.[40]\r\n\r\nFrom this school the art is believed to have spread in these early times\r\nover all Tuscany, although it must not be forgotten that there were\r\nminiature painters there as well as in the other parts of Italy, who,\r\ntransferring their art from small to large works, like Franco of\r\nBologna, betook themselves, and incited others to painting on walls and\r\non panel. Whatever we may choose to believe, Siena, at this period,\r\ncould boast her Guido, who painted from the year 1221, but not entirely\r\nin the manner of the Greeks, as we shall find under the Sienese school.\r\nLucca possessed in 1235 one Bonaventura Berlingieri. A San Francesco\r\npainted by him still exists in the castle of Guiglia, not far from\r\nModena, which is described as a work of great merit for that age.[41]\r\nThere lived another artist about the year 1288, known by his production\r\nof a crucifixion which he left at San Cerbone, a short distance from the\r\ncity with this inscription; \"_Deodatus filius Orlandi de Luca me\r\npinxit_, A. D. 1288.\" Margaritone of Arezzo was a disciple and imitator\r\nof the Greeks, and by all accounts he must have been born several years\r\nbefore Cimabue. He painted on canvas, and if we may credit Vasari, made\r\nthe first discovery of a method of rendering his pictures more durable,\r\nand less liable to cracking. He extended canvas on the panel, laying it\r\ndown with a strong glue, made of shreds of parchment, and covered the\r\nwhole with a ground of gypsum, before he began to paint. He formed\r\ndiadems and other ornaments of plaster, giving them relief from gilding\r\nand burnishing them. Some of his crucifixions remain in Arezzo, and one\r\nof them is in the church of the Holy Cross at Florence, near another by\r\nCimabue; both are in the old manner, and not so different in point of\r\nmerit, but that Margaritone, however rude, may be pronounced as well\r\nentitled as Cimabue to the name of painter.\r\n\r\nWhile the neighbouring cities had made approaches towards the new style,\r\nFlorence, if we are to credit Vasari and his followers, was without a\r\npainter; but subsequent to the year 1250 some Greek painters were\r\ninvited to Florence by the rulers of the city, for the express purpose\r\nof restoring the art of painting in Florence, where it was rather wholly\r\nlost than degenerated. To this assertion I have to oppose the learned\r\ndissertation of Doctor Lami, which I have just commended. Lami observes,\r\nthat mention is made in the archives of the chapters of one Bartolommeo\r\nwho painted in 1236, and that the picture of the Annunciation of our\r\nLady, which is held in the highest veneration in the church of the\r\nServi, was painted about that period. It is retouched in some parts of\r\nthe drapery; it possesses, however, much originality, and for that age\r\nis respectably executed. When I prepared my first edition I had no\r\nknowledge of the work of Lami, which was not then published, and hence\r\nwas unable to proceed further than to refute the opinion of those who\r\nascribed this sacred figure to Cavallini, a pupil of Giotto. I reflected\r\nthat the style of Cavallini appeared considerably more modern in his\r\nother works which I had examined at Assisi, and at Florence; yet,\r\nvarious artists whom I consulted, and among others Signor Pacini, who\r\nhad copied the Annunciation, disputed with me this diversity of style. I\r\nfurther adduced the form of the characters written there in a book,\r\n_Ecce Virgo concipiet, &c._ which resemble those of the thirteenth\r\ncentury; nor have they that profusion of lines which distinguishes the\r\nGerman, commonly denominated the Gothic character, which Cavallini and\r\nother pupils of Giotto always employed. I rejoice that the opinion of\r\nLami confirms my conjecture, and stamps its authenticity; and it seems\r\nto me highly probable that the Bartolommeo, whom he indicates, is the\r\nindividual to whom the memorandums of the Servi ascribe the production\r\nof their Annunciation about the year 1250. The same religious fraternity\r\npreserve, among their ancient paintings, a Magdalen, which appears from\r\nthe design and inscription, a work of the thirteenth century; and we\r\nmight instance several coeval pictures that still exist in their\r\nchapter house, and in other parts of the city.[42]\r\n\r\nHaving inserted these notices of ancient painters, and some others,\r\nwhich will be found scattered throughout the work, I turn to Vasari, and\r\nto the accusations laid to his charge. He is defended by Monsignor\r\nBottari in a note at the conclusion of the life of Margaritone, taken\r\nfrom Baldinucci. He affirms, from his own observation, \"That though each\r\ncity had some painters, they were all as contemptible and barbarous as\r\nMargaritone, who, if compared to Cimabue, is unworthy of the name of\r\npainter.\" The examples already cited do not permit me to assent to this\r\nproposition; even Bottari himself will scarcely allow me to do so, as he\r\nobserves, in another note on the life of Cimabue, \"That he was the first\r\nwho abandoned the manner of the Greeks, or at least who avoided it more\r\ncompletely than any other artist.\" But if others, such as Guido,\r\nBonaventura, and Giunta, had freed themselves from it before his time,\r\nwhy are they not recorded as the first, in point of time, by Vasari? Did\r\nnot their example open the new path to Cimabue? Did they not afford a\r\nray of light to reviving art? Were they not in painting what the two\r\nGuidos were in poetry, who, however much surpassed by Dante, are\r\nentitled to the first place in a history of our poets? Vasari would\r\ntherefore have acted better had he followed the example of Pliny, who\r\ncommences with the rude designers, Ardices of Corinth, and Telephanes of\r\nSicyon; he then minutely narrates the invention of Cleophantes the\r\nCorinthian, who coloured his designs with burnt earth; next, that of\r\nEumarus the Athenian, who first represented the distinction of age and\r\nsex. Then comes that of Cimon of Cleonae, who first expressed the various\r\nattitudes of the head, and aimed at representing the truth, even in the\r\njoints of the fingers and the folds of the garments. Thus, the merits of\r\neach city, and every artist, appear in ancient history; and it seems to\r\nme just, that the same should be done, as far as possible, in modern\r\nhistory. These observations may, at present, suffice in regard to a\r\nsubject that has been made a source of complaint and dispute among many\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it cannot be denied that there is no city to which painting\r\nis more indebted than to Florence, nor any name more proper to mark an\r\nepoch, whatever may be the opinion of Padre della Valle,[43] than that\r\nof Cimabue. The artists whom I have before mentioned had few followers;\r\ntheir schools, with the exception of that of Siena, languished, and were\r\neither gradually dispersed, or united themselves to that of Florence.\r\nThis school in a short time eclipsed every other, and has continued to\r\nflourish in a proud succession of artists, uninterrupted even down to\r\nour own days. Let us then trace it from its commencement.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Cimabue, descended from illustrious ancestors,[44] was both an\r\narchitect and a painter. That he was the pupil of Giunta is conjectured\r\nin our times, only because the Greeks were less skilful than the\r\nItalians. It ought to be a previous question, whether the supposed\r\nscholar and master ever resided in the same place, which it would seem,\r\nafter the observations before adduced, can scarcely be admitted.[45] It\r\nappears from history, that he learnt the art from some Greeks who were\r\ninvited to Florence, and painted in S. Maria Novella, according to\r\nVasari. It is an error to assert that they painted in the chapel of the\r\nGondi, which was built a century after, together with the church; it was\r\ncertainly in another chapel, under the church, where those Greek\r\npaintings were covered with plaister, and their place supplied by\r\nothers, the work of a painter of the thirteenth century.[46]\r\n\r\nNot long since a part of the new plaister fell down, and some of the\r\nvery rude figures of those Greek painters became again visible. It is\r\nprobable that Cimabue imitated them in early life, and perhaps at that\r\ntime painted the S. Francesco and the little legends which surround it\r\nin the church of S. Croce. But, if I mistake not, it is doubtful who\r\npainted this picture; at least it neither has the manner nor the\r\ncolouring of the works of Cimabue, even when young. I may refer to the\r\nS. Cecilia, with the implements of her martyrdom, in the church\r\ndedicated to that Saint, and which was afterwards removed to that of San\r\nStefano, a picture greatly superior to that of S. Francesco.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, like other Italians of his age, Giovanni got the\r\nbetter of his Greek education, which seems to have consisted in one\r\nartist copying another without ever adding any thing to the practice of\r\nhis master. He consulted nature, he corrected in part the rectilinear\r\nforms of his design, he gave expression to the heads, he folded the\r\ndrapery, and he grouped the figures with much greater art than the\r\nGreeks. His talent did not consist in the graceful. His Madonnas have no\r\nbeauty, his angels in the same piece have all the same forms. Wild as\r\nthe age in which he lived, he succeeded admirably in heads full of\r\ncharacter, especially in those of old men, impressing an indescribable\r\ndegree of bold sublimity, which the moderns have not been able greatly\r\nto surpass. Vast and inventive in conception, he executed large\r\ncompositions, and expressed them in grand proportions. His two great\r\naltar-pieces of the Madonna, at Florence, the one in the church of the\r\nDominicans, the other in that of the Trinity, with the grand figures of\r\nthe prophets, do not give so good an idea of his style as his fresco\r\npaintings in the church of Assisi, where he appears truly magnificent\r\nfor the age in which he lived. In these histories of the Old and New\r\nTestament, such as remain, he appears an Ennius, who, amid the rudeness\r\nof Roman epic poetry, gave flashes of genius not displeasing to a\r\nVirgil. Vasari speaks of him with admiration for the vigour of his\r\ncolouring, and justly so of the pictures in the ceiling. They are still\r\nin a good state of preservation, and although some of the figures of\r\nChrist, and of the Virgin in particular, retain much of the Greek\r\nmanner, others representing the Evangelists, and Doctors instructing the\r\nMonks of the Franciscan Order, from their chairs, exhibit an originality\r\nof conception and arrangement that does not appear in contemporary\r\nworks. The colouring is bold, the proportions are gigantic even in the\r\ndistance, and not badly preserved; in short, painting may there be said\r\nto have almost advanced beyond what the mosaic worker at first attempted\r\nto do. The whole of these, indeed, are steps in the progress of the\r\nhuman intellect not to be recounted in one history, and form beyond\r\nquestion the distinguishing excellence of the Florentine artist, when\r\nput into competition with either the Pisans or the Sienese. Nor do I\r\nperceive how, after the authority of Vasari, who assigns the work of the\r\nceiling to Cimabue, confirmed by the tradition of five centuries, P.\r\ndella Valle is justified at this day, in ascribing that painting to\r\nGiotto, a painter of a milder genius. If he was induced to prefer other\r\nartists to Cimabue, because they gave the eyes less fierceness, and the\r\nnose a finer shape, these circumstances appear to me too insignificant\r\nto degrade Cimabue from that rank which he enjoys in impartial\r\nhistory.[47] He has moreover asserted, that Cimabue neither promoted nor\r\ninjured the Florentine school by his productions, a harsh judgment, in\r\nthe opinion of those who have perused so many old writers belonging to\r\nthe city who have celebrated his merits, and of those who have studied\r\nthe works of the Florentine artists before his time, and seen how\r\ngreatly Cimabue surpasses them.\r\n\r\nIf Cimabue was the Michelangiolo of that age, Giotto was the Raffaello.\r\nPainting, in his hands, became so elegant, that none of his school, nor\r\nof any other, till the time of Masaccio, surpassed, or even equalled\r\nhim, at least in gracefulness of manner. Giotto was born in the country,\r\nand was bred a shepherd; but he was likewise born a painter; and\r\ncontinually exercised his genius in delineating some object or other\r\naround him. A sheep which he had drawn on a flat stone, after nature,\r\nattracted the notice of Cimabue, who by chance passed that way: he\r\ndemanded leave of his father to take him to Florence, that he might\r\nafford him instruction; confident, that in him, he was about to raise up\r\na new ornament to the art. Giotto commenced by imitating his master, but\r\nquickly surpassed him. An Annunciation, in the possession of the Fathers\r\nof Badia, is one of his earliest works. The style is somewhat dry, but\r\nshews a grace and diligence, that announced the improvement we\r\nafterwards discern. Through him symmetry became more chaste, design more\r\npleasing, and colouring softer than before. The meagre hands, the sharp\r\npointed feet, and staring eyes, remnants of the Grecian manner, all\r\nacquired more correctness under him.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to assign the cause of this transition, as we are\r\nable to do in the case of later painters; but it is reasonable to\r\nconclude that it was not wholly produced, even by the almost divine\r\ngenius of this artist, unaided by adventitious circumstances. There is\r\nno necessity for sending him, as some have done, to be instructed at\r\nPisa; his history does not warrant it, and an historian is not a\r\ndiviner. Much less ought we to refer him to the school of F. Jacopo da\r\nTurrita, and give him Memmi and Lorenzetti for fellow pupils, who are\r\nnot known to have been in Rome when F. Jacopo was distinguished for his\r\nbest manner. But P. della Valle thinks he discovers in Giotto's first\r\npainting, the style and composition of Giunta, (Preface to Vasari, p.\r\n17,) and in the pictures of Giotto at S. Croce, in Florence, which \"_he\r\nhas meditated upon a hundred times_,\" he recognizes F. Jacopo, and finds\r\n\"_reason for opining_\" that he was the master of Giotto. (Vide tom. ii.\r\np. 78.) When a person becomes attached to a system, he often sees and\r\nopines what no one else can possibly see or opine. In the same manner\r\nBaldinucci wished to refer to the school of Giotto, one Duccio da Siena,\r\nVital di Bologna, and many others, as will be noticed; and he too argues\r\nupon a resemblance of style, which, to say truth, neither I nor any one\r\nI know can perceive. If I cannot then agree with Baldinucci, can I value\r\nhis imitator? and more particularly as it is no question here of Vitale,\r\nor any other artist of mediocrity, almost unknown to history, but of\r\nGiotto himself. Is it likely, with a genius such as his, and born in an\r\nage not wholly barbarous, with the advantages enjoyed under Cimabue,\r\nespecially in point of colouring, that he would take Giunta for his\r\nmodel, or listen to the instruction of Fra Mino, in order to excel his\r\nmaster. Besides, what advantage can be obtained from thus disturbing the\r\norder of chronology, violating history, and rejecting the tradition of\r\nGiotto's native school, in order to account for his new style?\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that, as the great Michelangiolo, by modelling and\r\nstudying the antique, quickly surpassed in painting his master,\r\nGhirlandaio, the same occurred with regard to Giotto. It is at least\r\nknown that he was also a sculptor, and that his models were preserved\r\ntill the time of Lorenzo Ghiberti. Nor was he without good examples.\r\nThere were specimens of antique sculpture at Florence, which may be yet\r\nseen near the cathedral, (not to mention those which he afterwards saw\r\nat Rome); and their merit, then already established by the practice of\r\nNiccola and Giovanni of Pisa, could not be unknown to Giotto, to whom\r\nnature had granted such a taste for the exquisite and the beautiful.\r\nWhen one contemplates some of his heads of men; some of his forms,\r\nproportioned far beyond the littleness of his contemporaries; his taste\r\nin flowing, natural, and becoming drapery; some of his attitudes after\r\nthe manner of the antique, breathing grace and tranquillity, it is\r\nscarce possible to doubt that he derived no small advantage from ancient\r\nsculpture. His very defects discover this. A good writer (the author of\r\nthe Guide of Bologna) remarks in him a style which partakes of statuary,\r\ncontrary to the practice of contemporary foreign artists; a circumstance\r\nvery common, as we shall observe, under the Roman school, to those\r\npainters who designed from statues. I shall be told that he probably\r\nderived assistance from the sculpture of the two Pisani; especially as\r\nBaldinucci has discovered a strong resemblance between his style and\r\nthat of Giovanni, and some others also have noticed the circular\r\ncompositions, the proportions and casting of the drapery which one\r\nperceives in the basso-relievos of the early Pisan school. I would not\r\ndeny that he also availed himself of them; but it was perhaps in the\r\nmanner that Raffaello profited by Michelangiolo, whose example taught\r\nhim to imitate the antique. Nor let it be objected to me that the\r\ndryness of the design, the artifice of concealing the feet by long\r\ngarments, the inaccuracy of the extremities, and similar defects, betray\r\nrather a Pisan than an Attic origin. This only proves, that when he\r\nbecame the founder of a style, he did not aim at giving it the\r\nperfection of which it was susceptible, and which it could hardly be\r\nexpected to obtain amid the numerous avocations in which he appears to\r\nhave been engaged; in short, I cannot persuade myself, that without the\r\nimitation of the antique, he could in so short a time have made such a\r\nprogress, as to have been admired even by Bonarruoti himself.[48]\r\n\r\nThe first histories of the patriarch S. Francesco, at Assisi, near the\r\npaintings of his master, shew how greatly he excelled him. As his work\r\nadvanced he became more correct; and towards the conclusion, he already\r\nmanifested a design more varied in the countenances, and improved in the\r\nextremities; the features are more animated, the attitudes more\r\ningenious, and the landscape more natural. To one who examines them with\r\nattention, the composition appears the most surprising; a branch of the\r\nart, in which he seems not only to surpass himself, but even sometimes\r\nappears unrivalled. In many historical pictures, he often aimed at\r\nornamenting with buildings, which he painted of a red, or azure, or a\r\nyellow, the colours employed in staining houses, or of a dazzling white,\r\nin imitation of Parian marble. One of his best pictures in this work is\r\nthat of a thirsty person, to the expression of which scarcely any thing\r\ncould be added by the animating pencil of Raffaello d'Urbino himself.\r\nWith similar skill he painted in the inferior church, and this is\r\nperhaps the best performance which has reached our times, though\r\nspecimens remain in Ravenna, in Padua, in Rome, in Florence, and in\r\nPisa. It is assuredly the most spirited of all, for he has there, with\r\nthe most poetical images, depicted the saint shunning vice, and a\r\nfollower of virtue; it is my opinion that he here gave the first example\r\nof symbolical painting, so familiar to his best followers.\r\n\r\nHis inventions, which, according to the custom of the age, were employed\r\nin scripture history, are repeated by him in nearly the same style in\r\nseveral places; and are generally most pleasing when the proportions of\r\nthe figures are the least. His small pictures of the Acts of St. Peter\r\nand St. Paul, with some representations of our Saviour, and of various\r\nsaints, in the sacristy of the Vatican, appear most elegant and highly\r\nfinished miniatures; as likewise are some others in the church of the\r\nHoly Cross at Florence, taken from scriptural history, or from the life\r\nof St. Francis. The real art of portrait painting commenced with him; to\r\nwhom we are indebted for correct likenesses of Dante, of Brunetto\r\nLatini, and of Corso Donati. It was indeed before attempted, but,\r\naccording to Vasari, no one had succeeded. He also improved the art of\r\nworking in mosaic; a piece wrought by him in the Navicella, or ship of\r\nSt. Peter, may be seen in the portico of that cathedral; but it has been\r\nso much repaired, that now the design is wholly different, and appears\r\nthe work of another artist. It is believed that the art of miniature\r\npainting, so much prized in that age for the ornamenting of missals,\r\nreceived great improvement from him.[49] Architecture undoubtedly did;\r\nthe admirable belfry of the cathedral of Florence is the work of Giotto.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting all the notices he could of the scholars of Cimabue and\r\nGiotto, Baldinucci endeavours to make us believe that all the benefits\r\nwhich accrued to painting, sculpture, and architecture in Italy, and\r\neven throughout the world, came directly or indirectly from Florence.\r\nThe following is the manner in which he expresses himself in his first\r\npages, with the proofs which he adduces. \"During my researches, I have\r\nascertained beyond all doubt the truth of an opinion I always considered\r\nas indisputable, and which is not controverted by respectable ancient\r\nhistorians; that these arts in the first place were restored by Cimabue\r\nand Giotto, and afterwards diffused over the world by their disciples;\r\nand I conceived the idea of making it evident by the help of a tree,\r\nwhich at a glance might shew their progress from the earliest to the\r\npresent times.\" He published the first small part of this tree, just as\r\nI exhibit it to the reader; and promised in each succeeding volume to\r\ngive another part, that would establish the connexion with the principal\r\nroot (Cimabue), or with the branches derived from it; a promise from\r\nwhich he adroitly delivered himself; therefore we are without any more\r\nthan these few branches that follow:\r\n\r\n                       CIMABUE.\r\n  _____________________________________________________\r\n  |               |       |         |        |         |\r\n  Arnolfo,        |       |         |        |      Oderigi,\r\n  |             Gaddo.

Giovanni,            in         and\r\n  architects.           mosaic.    architect.\r\n\r\nBut with all his pains he has not satisfied the public expectation, as\r\nis observed by Signor Piacenza, who published the splendid Turin edition\r\nof Baldinucci as far as the life of Franciabigio, accompanied with very\r\nuseful notes and dissertations.[50] It is alleged, that to make this\r\ntree fair and flourishing, he has inserted in it branches dexterously\r\nstolen from his neighbours, who have not failed to reclaim their\r\nproperty. I rejoice to write in an age when the opinions of Baldinucci\r\nhave few followers even in Florence. The excellent work entitled\r\n\"_Etruria Pittrice_,\" composed and applauded in that city in proportion\r\nas it is free from the prejudice of former times, proves this\r\nsufficiently. Following in like manner the light of history and of\r\nreason, unswayed by party spirit, I shall in the first place observe,\r\nthat among all the scholars of Cimabue, I do not find any named by\r\nVasari, but Giotto and Arnolfo di Lapo, concerning whom it is certain\r\nthat the historian was in error. Lapo and Arnolfo are the names of two\r\ndifferent sculptors, _disciples_ of Niccolo Pisano, who, being already\r\nversed in the art, assisted him in 1266 to adorn with history pieces the\r\npulpit of the cathedral at Siena, an authentic document of which remains\r\nin the archives of the work.[51] Thus this branch of the tree belongs to\r\nPisa, unless Cimabue have a claim to it, by contributing in some degree\r\nto the instruction of Arnolfo in the principles of architecture. Andrea\r\nTafi was the pupil of Apollonius, a Greek artist, and assisted him in\r\nthe church of St. John, in some pieces of mosaic, from scriptural\r\nhistory, which, according to Vasari, are without invention and without\r\ndesign; but he improved as he proceeded, for the last part of the work\r\nwas less despicable than the beginning. Cimabue is not named in these\r\nworks, nor in what Tafi afterwards executed without assistance; and as\r\nhe was old when Cimabue began to teach, I cannot conceive how he can be\r\nreckoned the scholar of the latter, or a branch from that root. Gaddo\r\nGaddi, says Vasari, was contemporary with Cimabue, and was his intimate\r\nfriend, as well as that of Tafi; through their friendship he received\r\nhints for his improvement in mosaic. At first he followed the manner of\r\nthe Greeks, mingled with that of Cimabue. After long working in this\r\nmanner, he went to Rome, and there improved his style, while employed on\r\nthe facade of S. Maria Maggiore, by his own genius, assisted in my\r\nopinion by imitating the ancient workers in mosaic. He also painted some\r\naltar-pieces, and I saw at Florence one of his crucifixions, of a square\r\nfigure, and very respectable workmanship. This circumstance induces me\r\nto consider Gaddo, in some measure, among the imitators of Cimabue, but\r\nnot one of his pupils; for it appears to me unjust, should a\r\ncontemporary communicate with an artist either as a friend, or for the\r\nsake of advice on the art, to set him immediately down as a branch from\r\nthat stock. Vasari relates of Ugolino Senese, that he was a tenacious\r\nfollower of the Greek style, and inclined more to imitate Cimabue than\r\nGiotto. He does not on this account, indeed, expressly say, that he had\r\nbeen his scholar; he rather hints that he had other instructors at\r\nSiena, for which reason it will be better to consider him under that\r\nschool, there being no reason to doubt that he belonged to it. In that\r\nof Bologna we should also class Oderigo, who, as a miniature painter,\r\nwas more likely to employ some other master than a painter in fresco\r\nlike Cimabue. In the mean time it is useful to reflect, that were the\r\nmethod of Baldinucci to be pursued, nothing authentic would remain in a\r\nhistory of painting; and the schools of the early masters would increase\r\nbeyond all limits, were the scholars of each master to be confounded\r\nwith his friends, acquaintances, and contemporaries, who paid attention\r\nto his maxims.\r\n\r\nIt is still more strange to peruse the account of the connexion between\r\nthe first and secondary branches of the tree, or if one may use the\r\nexpression, between the children and grandchildren of Cimabue. There is\r\nnothing natural in their succession, and the labour is wholly useless\r\nwhich derives the professors of every fine art, of whatever country,\r\npast, present, and to come, from one individual. F. Ristoro and F. Sisto\r\nwere eminent architects, who rebuilt the grand bridges of the Carraja\r\nand the Holy Trinity, about 1264, when Cimabue was twenty-four years of\r\nage. Baldinucci writes of both, that they were, perhaps, disciples or\r\nimitators of Arnolfo, from the state of their works. But how comes he to\r\nfound on a _perhaps_, what he, a little before, had vaunted as a _clear\r\ndemonstration_? And then, on what does this _perhaps_ rest? Is it not\r\nmore probable that Arnolfo, and Cimabue himself, imitated them? That Fra\r\nMino da Turrita should appear in his tree as a scholar of Tafi, and as\r\nposterior to Cimabue, is no less absurd. In 1225, a date omitted by\r\nBaldinucci, Mino wrought in mosaic at Florence, fifteen years before\r\nCimabue was born. In his old age he commenced a similar work in the\r\ncathedral of Pisa, \"in the same style in which he had executed his other\r\nlabours,\" says Vasari, who adds, that Tafi and Gaddi (both his inferiors\r\nin age and reputation) assisted him. The work was \"little more than\r\nbegun,\" from which we may infer that they were not long associated. It\r\nseems to me extraordinary how Baldinucci could assert, \"it appears that\r\nVasari imagined that Mino was the pupil of Andrea Tafi,\" which is\r\ncontrary to fact: instead of the \"_clear demonstration_,\" which he\r\npromised, he has amused us with \"_it appears_,\" which is evident only to\r\nhimself. At length, wishing to make us believe that Giovanni Pisano the\r\nsculptor is a _pupil_ of Giotto the painter, he again turns to Vasari,\r\nfrom whom he brings evidence that Giovanni, having completed his work in\r\nthe cathedral of Arezzo, and being then established at Orvieto, came to\r\nFlorence to examine the architecture of S. Maria del Fiore, and to\r\nbecome acquainted with Giotto: he further notices two pieces which he\r\nexecuted at Florence, the one a Madonna between two little angels, over\r\nthe gate of the cathedral; the other a small baptism of St. John; this\r\nhappened in 1297. Here Baldinucci hazards a reflection, that \"if one\r\ncompares the other works of this artist with the above mentioned figure\r\nof the Virgin Mary ... we may recognize in it such improvement ... and\r\nso much of the manner of Giotto, that there cannot remain a doubt but he\r\nis to be reckoned a disciple of this master, both in respect of his\r\nimitation of him, and his observance of his precepts, _which he followed\r\nduring so many years in the exercise of the profession_.\" Every\r\nattentive reader will discover here not a clear demonstration of the\r\nassumption, but a mass of difficulties. He compares this to the other\r\nfigures made by Pisano at Florence, before he was acquainted with\r\nGiotto; and yet this was the first which he there executed. He wishes to\r\nmake Giovanni, already sixty years of age, an imitator of Giotto, then\r\ntwenty-one, when it is much more probable that Giotto would follow him,\r\nthe best sculptor of the age. There is no foundation for the supposed\r\ninstruction which Giovanni received from Giotto, who, shortly after,\r\ndeparted for Rome; where, after some other works, he executed the mosaic\r\nof the _boat_ in 1298. In short, the whole question of preceptorship\r\nrests on no better authority than a single figure. How great are the\r\ninconsistencies in this account, and how absurd the explanations and\r\nrepetitions which are offered! What further shall we say? Is it not\r\nlamentable thus to see so many old and honoured artists compelled, in\r\nspite of history, to become pupils to masters so much younger and less\r\ncelebrated than themselves? I know that various writers have censured\r\nBaldinucci as an historian of doubtful fidelity, artful in concealing or\r\nmisrepresenting facts, captious in expounding the opinions of Vasari,\r\nand more intent on captivating than instructing his readers. I am not\r\nignorant that his system was controverted even in his own country, as\r\nappears from his work published there, entitled _Delle Veglie_; and that\r\nSignor Marmi, a learned Florentine, strongly suspected his fair dealing,\r\nof which we shall adduce a proof under the Sienese school. Nevertheless\r\nI take into account that he wrote in an age less informed in regard to\r\nthe history of painting, and that he defended an opinion then much more\r\ncommon in Italy than at present. He had promised Cardinal Leopoldo de'\r\nMedici to demonstrate it incontrovertibly for the honour of his country,\r\nand of the house of Medici, and had received advice and assistance from\r\nhim in order to encourage him to defend it, and to refute the contrary\r\nopinion. Under the necessity of answering Malvasia,[52] a severe writer\r\nagainst Vasari, and of proving his assertion, that the people of\r\nBologna, no less than those of Siena, of Pisa, and other places, had\r\nlearned the art from the Florentines, he formed a false system, the\r\nabsurdity of which he did not immediately perceive; but he at last\r\ndiscovered it, as Signor Piacenza observes, and succeeded in escaping\r\nfrom its trammels. The most ingenious builders of systems have subjected\r\nthemselves very frequently to the same disadvantage, and the history of\r\nliterature abounds with similar instances.\r\n\r\nHaving examined this sophism, I cannot subscribe to the opinion of\r\nBaldinucci; but shall comprise my own opinion in two propositions:--The\r\nfirst is, That the improvement of painting is not due to Florence alone.\r\nIt has been remarked, that the career of human genius, in the progress\r\nof the fine arts, is the same in every country. When the man is\r\ndissatisfied with what the child learned, he gradually passes from the\r\nruder elements to what is less so, and from thence, to diligence and\r\nprecision; he afterwards advances to the grand, and the select, and at\r\nlength attains facility of execution.\r\n\r\nSuch was the progress of sculpture among the Grecians, and such has been\r\nthat of painting in our own country. When Correggio advanced from\r\nlaborious minuteness to grandeur, it was not necessary for him to know\r\nthat such was the progress of Raffaello, or, at any rate, to have\r\nwitnessed it: in like manner, nothing more was wanting to the painters\r\nof the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, than to learn that hitherto\r\nthey had pursued a wrong path; this was sufficient to guide them into a\r\nbetter path, and it was not then untried; for sculpture had already\r\nimproved design. We have, in fact, seen the Pisani, and their scholars,\r\npreceding the Florentines; and, as their precursors, diffusing a new\r\nsystem of design over Italy. It would be injustice to overlook them in\r\nthe improvement of painting, in which design is of such importance; or\r\nto suppose that they did not signally contribute to its improvement. But\r\nif Italy be indebted solely to Cimabue and Giotto for its progress, all\r\nthe good artists should have come from Florence. And yet, in the\r\ncathedral of Orvieto (to instance the finest work, perhaps, of that\r\nage), we find, from the beginning of the fourteenth century, many\r\nartists from various other places, who would not have been called to\r\nornament such a building, had they not previously enjoyed the reputation\r\nof able masters.[53] Add to this, if we are to derive all painters from\r\nthose two masters, every style of painting should resemble that of their\r\nFlorentine disciples. But on examining the old paintings of Siena, of\r\nVenice, of Bologna, and of Parma, they are found to be dissimilar in\r\nidea, in choice of colouring, and in taste of composition. All, then,\r\nare not derived from Florence.\r\n\r\nMy second proposition is, That no people then excelled in, nor\r\ncontributed, by example, so much to the progress of art as the\r\nFlorentines. Rival cities may boast artists of merit, even in the first\r\nera of painting; their writers may deny the fame of Giotto and his\r\ndisciples; but truth is more powerful than declamation. Giotto was the\r\nfather of the new method of painting, as Boccaccio was called the father\r\nof the new species of prose composition. After the time of the latter,\r\nany subject could be elegantly treated of in prose; after the former,\r\npainting could express all subjects with propriety. A Simon da Siena, a\r\nStefano da Firenze, a Pietro Laurati, added charms to the art; but they\r\nand others owe to Giotto the transition from the old to a new manner. He\r\nessayed it in Tuscany, and while yet a young man, greatly improved it,\r\nto the general admiration of all classes. He did not leave Assisi until\r\ncalled to Rome by Boniface VIII., nor did he take up his residence at\r\nAvignon, until invited to France by Clement V. Before going there, he\r\nwas induced to stop at Padua, and on returning some years after, he\r\nagain resided at the same place. At that time many parts of Italy were\r\nunder a republican form of government; but abounded in potent families,\r\nthat bore sway in various quarters, and which, while adorning their\r\ncountry, aimed at its subjugation. Giotto, beyond every other, was in\r\nuniversal request, both at home and abroad. The Polentani of Ravenna,\r\nthe Malatesti of Rimino, the Estensi of Ferrara, the Visconti of Milan,\r\nthe Scala of Verona, Castruccio of Lucca, and also Robert, king of\r\nNaples, sought to engage him with eagerness, and for some period\r\nretained him in their service. Milan, Urbino, Arezzo, and Bologna, were\r\ndesirous to possess his works; and Pisa, that, in her _Campo Santo_,\r\nafforded an opportunity for the choicest artists of Tuscany to vie with\r\none another,[54] as of old they contended at Corinth, and in Delphi,[55]\r\nobtained from him those historic paintings from the life of Job, which\r\nare greatly admired, though they are amongst his early productions. When\r\nGiotto was no more, similar applause was bestowed on his disciples:\r\ncities contended for the honour of inviting them, and they were even\r\nmore highly estimated than the native artists themselves. We shall find\r\nCavallini and Capanna in the Roman School; in that of Bologna the two\r\nFaentini, Pace, and Ottaviano, with Guglielmo da Forli; Menabuoi at\r\nPadua; Memmi, who was either a scholar or assistant of Giotto, at\r\nAvignon; and we shall find traces of the successors of the same school\r\nthroughout all Italy. This work will indicate the names of some of them;\r\nit will point out the style of others; without including the great\r\nnumber who, in every province, have been withdrawn from our view, for\r\nthe purpose of replacing old pictures with others in the new manner.\r\nGiotto thus became the model for students during the whole of the\r\nfourteenth century, as was Raffaello in the sixteenth, and the Caracci\r\nin the subsequent century: nor can I find a fourth manner that has been\r\nso generally received in Italy as that of those three schools. There\r\nhave been some who, from the inspiration of their own genius, had\r\nadopted a new manner, but they were little known or admired beyond the\r\nprecincts of their own country. Of the Florentines alone can it be\r\nasserted, that they diffused the modern style from one extremity of\r\nItaly to the other: in the restoration of painting, though not all, yet\r\nthe chief praise belongs to them; and this forms my second proposition.\r\n\r\nI proceed more willingly to the sequel of my work, having escaped from\r\nthat part of it in which, amid the contradictory sentiments of authors,\r\nI have often suspended my pen, mindful of the maxim, _Historia nihil\r\nfalsi audeat dicere, nihil veri non audeat_. Resuming the subject of\r\nFlorence, after the death of her great artist in 1336, I find painters\r\nhad there prodigiously multiplied, as I shall presently, from undoubted\r\ntestimony, proceed to prove. Not long afterwards, that is, in 1349, the\r\npainters associated themselves into a religious fraternity, which they\r\ndenominated the Society of St. Luke, first established in S. Maria\r\nNuova, but afterwards in S. Maria Novella. This was not the first that\r\nhad arisen in Italy, as Baldinucci affirms: in 1290 there was a company\r\nof painters previously established at Venice, of which St. Luke was the\r\npatron, the laws of which, it is believed, are still preserved in the\r\nchurch of St. Sophia.[56] But neither this, the Florentine, nor that of\r\nBologna, can be called academies for design; they were only the results\r\nof Christian devotion, a sort of school, such as formerly existed, and\r\nstill exist in many of the arts. They did not consist of painters alone;\r\nthese always possessed the most elevated rank; but in the same place\r\nwere assembled artists \"in metal and in wood, whose works partook, more\r\nor less, of design;\" as is related by Baldinucci, in describing the\r\nFlorentine association. In that of Venice were comprehended\r\nbasket-makers, gilders, and the lowest daubers; in that of Bologna were\r\nincluded even saddlers, and scabbard-makers; who were only divided from\r\nthe painters by means of lawsuits and decisions. That unrefined age did\r\nnot as yet acknowledge the dignity of painting; it denominated those\r\nartists master workmen, whom we now call professors of the art, and it\r\ncalled shops what we name studies. I have often doubted, whether the\r\nprogress of the arts was so rapid among us as in Greece, because, there,\r\npainting, either from the beginning or a very early era, was considered\r\nas a liberal art: with us its dignity was much longer in being\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\nHe who desires to discover the origin of those associations, will find\r\nit in the works composed of different arts then most in use, of which I\r\nshall treat somewhat fully, for the sake of illustrating the history. A\r\nlittle above I mentioned basket-makers: at that time, all kinds of\r\nfurniture, such as cupboards, benches, and chests, were wrought by\r\nmechanics, and then painted, especially when intended as the furniture\r\nof new married women. Many ancient cabinet pictures have been cut out of\r\nsuch pieces of furniture, and, by this means, preserved to later ages.\r\nAs for images on altars, through the whole of the fourteenth century,\r\nthey were not formed, as at present, on a separate piece from the\r\nsurrounding ornaments. There were made little altars, or dittici,[57] in\r\nmany parts of Italy, called _Ancone_; they first shaped the wood, and\r\nlaboriously ornamented it with carving. The design was conformed to the\r\nTeutonic, or, as it is called, the Gothic architecture, seen in the\r\nfacades of churches built in that age. The whole work was a load of\r\nminuteness, consisting of little tabernacles, pyramids, and niches; and\r\nvarious doors and windows, with semi-circular and pointed arches, were\r\nrepresented on the surface of the panel; a style very characteristic of\r\nthat period. I have sometimes there observed, in the middle, little\r\nstatues in mezzo-relievo.[58] Most frequently the painter designed these\r\nfigures or busts of saints: sometimes there were also prepared various\r\nsorts of little forms, or moulds--formelle--in which to represent\r\nhistories. Often there was a step added to the little altar, where, in\r\nseveral compartments, were likewise exhibited histories of our Saviour,\r\nof the Virgin, and of the martyrs, either real or feigned.[59] Sometimes\r\nvarious compartments were prepared, in which their lives were\r\nrepresented. The carvers in wood were so vain of their craft, that they\r\noften inscribed their own names before that of the painter.[60]\r\n\r\nEven pictures for rooms were fashioned by the carvers into triangular\r\nand square forms, which they surrounded with heavy borders, with rude\r\nfoliage, lace, or Arabesque ornaments around them. In that age, pictures\r\nwere rarely committed to canvass alone, though some such are to be seen\r\nat Florence, and more among the Venetians and people of Bologna; but\r\npanels were most frequently employed. The borders often inclosed\r\nportions of canvass, not unfrequently of parchment, and sometimes of\r\nleather, which, in all probability, were prepared by those who usually\r\nwrought in such materials; and this is the reason why such artists, and\r\neven in some instances saddlers, were sometimes associated with\r\npainters.\r\n\r\nHistory informs us that shields for war, or the tournament, and also\r\nvarious equestrian accoutrements, as the saddles and trappings of\r\nhorses, were ornamented with painting, a custom which was retained till\r\nthe time of Francia, as Vasari mentions in his life; hence, armourers\r\nand saddlers became associated with painters. Among them in like manner\r\nmight be included those who prepared walls for painting in fresco, and\r\nwho covered them with a reddish ground, which not unfrequently is still\r\ndiscovered in the flaws. On this colour the figures were designed, and\r\nsuch walls were the cartoons of the old masters. The stucco workers also\r\nassisted them in those relieved ornaments we see in fresco paintings. I\r\nbelieve they used moulds in those works, which seem nothing else than\r\nglobules, flowerets, and little stars, formed with a stamp, such as we\r\nsee on gilt plaister, on leather, on board, and on playing-cards. On\r\nwhatever substance they painted, some gold was usually added; with it\r\nthey ornamented the ground of their pictures, the glories of their\r\nsaints, their garments, and fringes. Although painters themselves were\r\nskilled in such labours, it appears that they sought the assistance of\r\ngilders, and therefore gilders were classed with painters, and like them\r\ninscribed works with their names.\r\n\r\nThis was the practice of Cini and Saracini, just before recorded, and\r\nparticularly of a native of Ferrara, who, in the pictures of the\r\nVivarini, at Venice, subscribes his name before theirs. (_See Zanetti,\r\nPittura Ven._ p. 15.) And in the cathedral of Ceneda, below an\r\nIncoronation of the Virgin, in which the artist did not care to exhibit\r\nhimself to posterity, the engraver, already noticed, left the following\r\ninscription, which Signor Lorenzo Giustiniani, a Venetian patrician of\r\ngreat taste and cultivation of mind, has very politely communicated to\r\nme; \"1438, A DI 10. FREVER CHRISTOFALO DA FERARA INTAJO.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fourteenth century, when the gothic style was\r\ndisappearing from architecture, the design of the carvers improved, and\r\nthey began to erect over altars oblong panels, divided by partitions,\r\nwhich were fashioned into pilasters, or small columns, and often between\r\nthese last feigned gates or windows, so that the ancona or altar bore\r\nsome resemblance to the facade of a palace or a church; over them was\r\nplaced a frieze, and above the frieze was a place like a stage with some\r\nfigures. The saints were placed below, and their histories were painted\r\nin the compartments; and often there appeared their histories painted\r\nupon some little form, or upon the steps. The partitions were gradually\r\nremoved, the proportions of the figures enlarged, and the saints were\r\ndisposed in a single piece around the throne of our Lord, not so erect\r\nas formerly, after the manner of statues, but in different actions and\r\npositions, a custom which prevailed even in the sixteenth century. The\r\npractice of gilding grounds declined towards the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, but it was increased on the garments, and fringes were never so\r\ndeep as at that period. About the close of that century gold was more\r\nsparingly employed, and it was almost wholly abandoned in the following.\r\nNo little benefit would be conferred upon the art by any one who would\r\nundertake to point out with accuracy what were the colours, gums, and\r\nother mixtures employed by the Greeks. They were undoubtedly in\r\npossession of the best methods transmitted to them by a tradition, which\r\nthough in some measure corrupted, was confessedly derived from their\r\nancestors. Even subsequent to the invention of oils, their colouring is\r\nin some degree deserving of our admiration. In the Medicean Museum there\r\nis a Madonna, subscribed with the following Latin inscription, _Andreas\r\nRico de Candia pinxit_, the forms of which are stupid, the folds\r\ninelegant, and the composition coarse; but with all this, the colour is\r\nso fresh, vivid, and brilliant, that there is no modern work that would\r\nnot lose by a comparison; indeed, the colouring is so extremely strong\r\nand firm, that when tried with the iron, it does not liquefy, but rather\r\nscales off, and breaks in minute portions. The frescos, likewise, of the\r\nearliest Greek and Italian painters, are surprisingly strong, and more\r\nparticularly in upper than in lower Italy. There are some figures of\r\nsaints upon the pilasters of the church of San Niccolo, at Trevigi,\r\nquite remarkable for their durability, an account of which is given in\r\nthe first volume of Padre Federici, (p. 188). I have understood from\r\nprofessors that such a degree of _consistency_ must have been produced\r\nby a certain portion of wax, which was employed at that period, as will\r\nbe explained in the subsequent chapter, on the subject of painting in\r\noil. It must, however, be admitted, that we are very little advanced in\r\nthese inquiries into the ancient methods of preparing colour. Were they\r\nonce satisfactorily explored, it would prove highly useful in the\r\nrestoration of ancient pictures, nor superfluous in regard to the\r\nadoption of that firm, fused, and lucid colouring, which we shall have\r\noccasion to commend in various Lombard and Venetian pictures, and more\r\nespecially in those of Coreggio.\r\n\r\nThese observations will not be useless to the connoisseur, who doubts\r\nthe age of a picture on which there are no characters. Where there are\r\nletters he may proceed with still greater certainty. The letters\r\nvulgarly called gothic, began to be used after the year 1200, in some\r\nplaces more early than in others; and characters were loaded with a\r\nsuperfluity of lines, through the whole of the fourteenth, until about\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century, when the use of the Roman alphabet\r\nwas revived. What forms were adopted by artists in subscribing their\r\nnames, will be more conveniently explained in the course of a few pages\r\nfurther. I have judged it proper to give here a sort of paleology of\r\npainting; because inattention to this has been, and still is, a fruitful\r\nsource of error. The reader, however, may observe, that though the rules\r\nhere proposed, afford some light to resolve doubtful points, they are\r\nnot to be considered as infallible and universal, and he may further\r\nrecollect, that in matters of antiquity nothing is more dangerous and\r\nridiculous, than to form general rules, which a single example may be\r\nsufficient to overthrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: See Tiraboschi, _Storia della Litterat.

From Vasari's life of Arnalfo, we learn that the same\r\nsculptor also executed the great gate of the Primaziale at Pisa, in\r\nbronze, about the year 1180, subsequently destroyed by fire. That of\r\nSanta Maria Nuova at Monreale, is likewise his. It is described by P.\r\ndel Giudice, in his account of that church, and bears the name of\r\nBonanno Pisano, with the date 1186. It is as rudely executed as the\r\npreceding one at Pisa, as I am assured by the Cavalier Puccini,\r\naccurately versed in every branch of the fine arts. If we wish to\r\nestimate the merit of Niccola Pisano, we have only to compare these two\r\ngates with the specimens which he gave us only a few years afterwards.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Several specimens of similar productions also remain in\r\nSicily, particularly at Mazzerra and Girganti.

It possesses all the\r\ncharacteristics attributed by Lanzi to this early age. Near the bottom\r\nof the picture is a label, inscribed, Franciscus Benanus, Filius Petri\r\nAblada. The size of the picture is 2 feet 8 by 2 feet 2, on panel,\r\ncovered with gypsum. The vehicle of the colours is probably prepared\r\nfrom eggs, which were usually employed for that purpose before the\r\ninvention of painting in oil, and to which an absorbent ground of lime\r\nor gypsum seems to have been indispensable. It is surprising how well\r\nthe early pictures executed in this style have preserved their colouring\r\nto the present day.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: This writer has thrown much light upon the history of our\r\nearly painters, from which I have derived and shall continue to derive,\r\nmuch benefit; but in the heat of dispute, he has frequently depreciated\r\nCimabue in a way which I cannot approve. For instance, Vasari having\r\nsaid, that \"he contributed greatly to the perfection of the art,\" della\r\nValle asserts, that \"he did it neither good nor harm;\" and that having\r\nclosely examined the pictures of Cimabue, \"he has found in them a ruder\r\nstyle than appears in those of Giunta Pisano, of Guido da Siena, of\r\nJacopo da Turrita, &c.\" (tom. i. p. 235.) Of the two last I shall speak\r\nelsewhere. With respect to the first, the writer contradicts himself\r\nfour pages after; when, commenting on another passage of the historian\r\nrelating to certain pictures of Cimabue, executed in Assisi in the\r\ninferior church of S. Francesco, he says, that \"he there, in his\r\nopinion, surpassed Giunta Pisano.\" It is to be remembered that this was\r\nhis first work, or amongst the first that Cimabue painted in Assisi.\r\nWhen he went thither, therefore, he was a better artist than Giunta.\r\nHow, then, when he worked in the superior church, in Assisi, and in so\r\nmany other places, did he become so bad a painter, and more uncouth than\r\nGiunta himself?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: See Baldinucci, tom. i. p. 17, Florentine Edition, 1767,\r\nwhere it is said that the Cimabuoi were also called _Gualtieri_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: But see Baldinucci in _Veglia_, p. 87.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: We read, in the preface to the Sienese edition of Vasari's\r\nLives, (p. 17) as follows: \"To Giunta and to the other artists of Pisa,\r\nas heads of the school, was given the principal direction of adorning\r\nthe Franciscan church; and Cimabue and Giotto are known to have been\r\neither disciples or assistants in their school, in which they produced\r\nseveral important works. Giunta had the direction of his assistant as\r\nlong as he resided there, which may have been even subsequent to 1236.\r\nBut how are we to suppose that he could have been at Assisi so long as\r\nto permit Cimabue (who was born in 1240, and went to Assisi about 1265)\r\nto assist, to receive instructions from, and to succeed him? Such a\r\nsupposition is still more untenable as regards Giotto, who was invited\r\nto Assisi many years afterwards.\" (Vasari.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: To the testimonies in favor of Cimabue, may be added one\r\nof no little weight, from the manuscript given to the public a few years\r\nsince, by the Abbate Morelli. We there find that Cimabue painted in\r\nPadua, in the church del Carmine, which was afterwards burnt; but that a\r\nhead of S. Giovanni, by him, being rescued from the flames, was inserted\r\nin a frame, and preserved in the house of Alessandro Capella. Would a\r\npainter, who had done neither good nor harm to the Florentine school,\r\nand to the art, have been invited to Padua? Would the remains of his\r\nworks have been held in such esteem? Would he have been so highly\r\nvalued, after so great a lapse of time, by Vasari, to whose arts he\r\nseems to wish to ascribe the reputation of Cimabue. Other proofs of this\r\nreputation may be seen in the defence of Vasari, in the present Book,\r\nthird Epoch. The writer of history ought completely to divest himself of\r\nthe love of system and party spirit.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Vasari, tom. i. p. 322.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: A book is mentioned by Baldinucci ornamented by Giotto\r\nwith miniatures, with histories from the Old Testament, and presented to\r\nthe vestry of St. Peter, by Cardinal Stefaneschi; of this he neither\r\nadduces any proof, nor can I find any record. From the evidence, rather,\r\nof an existing necrology, where, among the presents made by Stefaneschi\r\nto the cathedral, the pictures and the mosaic by Giotto are noticed\r\nwithout any other work of this artist, the gift of the book is very\r\ndoubtful. See Sig. Ab, Cancellieri _De Secretariis Veteris Basilicae\r\nVaticanae_, p. 859, and 2464. Some miniatures of the martyrdom and\r\nmiracles of St. George, in another book, are ascribed to him; but I am\r\nuncertain whether there is any ancient document for this; and they\r\nmight, possibly, be the work of Simone da Siena, who is often confounded\r\nwith him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See his first volume, pp. 131 and 202; and also P. della\r\nValle in the preface to Vasari, p. 27; also Signor da Morrona in his\r\nPisa Illustrata, p. 154; besides many other authors.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: D.

The same figure was\r\nretained, even in the introduction of the largest altar pieces, which\r\nlikewise consisted of two wings, and were portable. This custom, of\r\nwhich I have seen few remnants in Italy, has been long preserved in the\r\nGreek church. At length, by degrees, artists began to paint upon one\r\nwhole panel.

II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that Vasari, in the life of Jacopo di Casentino,\r\nquotes the manuscript records of the society of St. Luke, afterwards\r\nprinted by Baldinucci, and mentions fourteen painters who were formerly\r\nits captains, counsellors, or chamberlains; yet he takes no notice of\r\nthem in his _Lives_, and of but very few of the great number named in\r\nthat manuscript. The same selection was employed by Baldinucci, in whose\r\nVEGLIA we are informed that many painters flourished about 1300, the\r\nnames of whom he has refused to insert in his anecdotes. It clearly\r\nappears from his writings that he omitted about a hundred, all belonging\r\nto that age.[61] It is therefore incorrect to say, that those two\r\nhistorians have commemorated many artists of mediocrity, merely because\r\nthey were natives of Florence, an accusation alleged against them by\r\nforeigners. The artists of their country whom they have transmitted to\r\nposterity, are not less worthy of record than those ancient ones of\r\nVenice, of Bologna, and of Lombardy, whom we are accustomed to praise in\r\ntheir respective schools. Among this number I include Buffalmacco, the\r\nwit whose jests, as recorded in Boccaccio and Sacchetti, render him more\r\ncelebrated than his pictures. His real name was Buonamico di Cristofano.\r\nHe had been the scholar of Tafi, but by living long in the time of\r\nGiotto, he had an opportunity of correcting his own style. He displayed\r\na most lively fancy, \"and when he chose to exert himself (which rarely\r\nhappened) was not inferior to any of his contemporaries.\"[62] It is\r\nunfortunate that his best works, which were in the Abbey and in\r\nOgnisanti, have perished, and there only remain some less carefully\r\nexecuted at Arezzo and at Pisa. The best preserved are in the Campo\r\nSanto; viz. the Creation of the World, in which there is a figure of the\r\nDeity, five cubits high, sustaining the mighty frame of the heavens and\r\nthe elements, and three other historical pictures of Adam, of his\r\nchildren, and of Noah. A crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of the\r\nRedeemer, may be seen at the same place. Good symmetry is not to be\r\nlooked for in them; he knew but little of design, and he drew his\r\nfigures by other rules than the roundness and facility seen in the\r\ndisciples of Giotto. His heads are deficient in beauty and variety. The\r\npious women near the cross all have the same mean and vulgar features,\r\nin which the mouths are opened even to deformity. Some of the heads of\r\nthe men, especially that of Cain, possess, however, a physiognomical\r\nexpression which arrests the eye of the spectator. The air of nature too\r\nin the action, as in the man, who, full of horror, flies from Mount\r\nCalvary, is highly praiseworthy. His draperies are greatly varied, are\r\ndistinguished by the difference of stuffs and linings, and are\r\nlaboriously ornamented with flowers and with fringes. Before he was\r\nemployed in the Campo Santo, he painted in the church of St. Paul, Ripa\r\nd'Arno, where he was associated with one Bruno di Giovanni, formerly his\r\nfellow student, and believed to be the painter of a St. Ursula in a\r\npiece which still exists in the Commenda. Unable to attain the\r\nexpression of Buffalmacco, he tried to atone for the defect by the aid\r\nof sentences proceeding from the mouths of his figures, which expressed\r\nwhat their features and attitudes were incapable of explaining, a\r\npractice in which he was preceded by Cimabue, and followed by the\r\neccentric Orcagna and several others. This Bruno, together with Nello di\r\nDino, was associated with Buffalmacco in the jests contrived for the\r\nsimple Calandrino. They all owe their fame to Boccaccio, who introduces\r\nthem in the eighth day of his Decamerone; and a similar favour was\r\nconferred by Sacchetti on a Bartolo Gioggi, a house-painter, whom he\r\nintroduced into his one hundred and seventieth tale. Giovanni da Ponte,\r\nthe scholar of Buffalmacco, had some merit, but he was not at all\r\nsolicitous to increase it by his diligence. Some remains of his pictures\r\nexist on the walls of the church of St. Francis, at Arezzo.\r\n\r\nI believe that Bernardo Orcagna, who rivalled the fame of Buffalmacco,\r\nproceeded from some old school. He was the son of one Cione, a sculptor,\r\nand his brother Jacopo was of the same profession: but the other\r\nbrother, Andrea, surpassed them all; and in himself so far united the\r\nattainments of the three sister arts, that he was by some reckoned\r\nsecond only to Giotto. He is known among architects for having\r\nintroduced the circular arch instead of the acute, as may be seen in the\r\ngallery of the Lanzi, which he built and ornamented with sculpture.\r\nBernardo taught him the principles of painting. They who have\r\nrepresented him as the pupil of Angiol Gaddi, do not appear attentive to\r\ndates. In the Strozzi chapel in the church of S. Maria Novella, he and\r\nBernardo painted Paradise, and over against it the Infernal Regions; and\r\nin the Campo Santo of Pisa, Death and the Judgment were executed by\r\nAndrea, and Hell by Bernardo. The two brothers imitated Dante in the\r\nnovel representations which they executed at those places; and that\r\nstyle was more happily repeated by Andrea in the church of Santa Croce,\r\nwhere he inserted portraits of his enemies among the damned, and of his\r\nfriends among the blessed spirits. These pictures are the prototypes of\r\nsimilar pictures preserved in S. Petronio, at Bologna, in the cathedral\r\nof Tolentino, in the Badia del Sesto, at Friuli,[63] and some other\r\nplaces, in which hell is distinguished by abysses and a variety of\r\ntorments, after the manner of Dante. Several pictures by Andrea remain,\r\nand his name is still on that in the Strozzi chapel, which is full of\r\nfigures and of episodes. On the whole, he discovers fertility of\r\nimagination, diligence, and spirit, equal to any of his contemporaries.\r\nIn composition he was less judicious, in attitudes less exact, than the\r\nfollowers of Giotto; and he yields to them in drawing and in colouring.\r\n\r\nThe same school produced Marinotto, a nephew of Andrea, and a Tommaso di\r\nMarco, whom I pass over, as well as others of little note, no longer\r\nknown by existing works. Bernardo Nello di Gio. Falconi of Pisa merits\r\nconsideration. He executed many pictures in that cathedral, and is\r\nsupposed to be the same with that Nello di Vanni, who, with other Pisan\r\nartists, painted in the Campo Santo in the fourteenth century. Francesco\r\nTraini, a Florentine, is known as much superior to his master, by a\r\nlarge picture which is in the church of S. Catherine of Pisa, in which\r\nhe has represented St. Thomas Aquinas in his own form, and also in his\r\nbeatification. He stands in the middle of the picture, under the\r\nRedeemer, who sheds a glory on the Evangelists and him; and from them\r\nthe rays are scattered on a crowd of listeners, composed of clergy,\r\ndoctors, bishops, cardinals, and popes. Arius and other innovators are\r\nat the feet of the saint, as if vanquished by his doctrine; and near him\r\nappear Plato and Aristotle, with their volumes open, a circumstance not\r\nto be commended in such a subject. This work exhibits no skill in\r\ngrouping, no knowledge of relief, and it abounds in attitudes which are\r\neither too tame, or too constrained; and yet it pleases by a marked\r\nexpression in the countenances, an air of the antique in the draperies,\r\nand a certain novelty in the composition. Let us now pass on to the\r\nfollowers of Giotto.\r\n\r\nThe scholars of Giotto have fallen into an error common to the followers\r\nof all illustrious men; in despairing to surpass, they have only aspired\r\nto imitate him with facility. On this account the art did not advance so\r\nquickly as it might otherwise have done, among the Florentine and other\r\nartists of the fourteenth century, who flourished after Giotto. In the\r\nseveral cities above mentioned, Giotto invariably appears superior when\r\nseen in the vicinity of such painters as Cavallini, or Gaddi; and\r\nwhoever is acquainted with his style, stands in no need of a prolix\r\naccount of that of his followers, which, with a general resemblance to\r\nhim, is less grand and less agreeable. Stefano Fiorentino alone is a\r\nsuperior genius in the opinion of Vasari, according to whose account he\r\ngreatly excelled Giotto in every department of painting. He was the son\r\nof Catherine, a daughter of Giotto, and possessed a genius for\r\npenetrating into the difficulties of the art, and an insuperable desire\r\nof conquering them. He first introduced foreshortenings into painting,\r\nand if in this he did not attain his object, he greatly improved the\r\nperspective of buildings, the attitudes, and the variety and expression\r\nof the heads. According to Landino he was called the _Ape of Nature_, an\r\neulogy of a rude age; since such animals, in imitating the works of man,\r\nalways debase them: but Stefano endeavoured to equal and to embellish\r\nthose of nature. The most celebrated of his pictures which were in the\r\n_Ara Coeli_ at Rome, in the church of S. Spirito at Florence, and in\r\nother places, have all perished. As far as I know, his country does not\r\npossess one of his undoubted pictures; unless we mention as such, that\r\nof the Saviour in the Campo Santo of Pisa, which, indeed, is in a\r\ngreater manner than the works of this master, but it has been retouched.\r\nA _Pieta_, by his son and disciple Tommaso, as is believed by some,\r\nexists in S. Remigi at Florence, which strongly partakes of the manner\r\nof Giotto; like his frescos at Assisi. He deserved the name of Giottino,\r\ngiven him by his fellow citizens, who used to say that the soul of\r\nGiotto had transmigrated, and animated him. Baldinucci alleges that\r\nthere was another of the same name, who should not be confounded with\r\nhim, and quotes the following inscription from a picture in the Villa\r\nTolomei, \"Dipinse Tommaso di Stefano Fortunatino de' Gucci Tolomei.\" But\r\nCinelli, the strenuous opponent of Baldinucci, attributes it, perhaps\r\njustly, to Giottino. This artist left behind him one Lippo, sufficiently\r\ncommended by Vasari, but who rather seems to have been an imitator than\r\na scholar. Giovanni Tossicani of Arezzo, was a disciple of Giottino,\r\nemployed in Pisa and over all Tuscany. He painted the St. Philip and St.\r\nJames, which still remain on the baptismal font in Arezzo, and were\r\nrepaired by Vasari while a young man, who acknowledges that he learned\r\nmuch from this work, injured as it was. With him perished the best\r\nbranch of the stock of Giotto.\r\n\r\nTaddeo Gaddi may be considered as the Giulio Romano of Giotto, his most\r\nintimate and highly favoured pupil. Vasari, who saw his frescos and\r\neasel pictures at Florence, in good preservation, prefers him to his\r\nmaster, in colouring and in delicacy; but the lapse of time at this day\r\nforbids our deciding this point, although several of his pictures\r\nremain, especially in the church of Santa Croce, which are scriptural\r\nhistories, much in the manner of Giotto. He discovered more originality\r\nin the chapter house of the Spagnuoli, where he worked in competition\r\nwith Memmi.[64] He painted some of the acts of the Redeemer on the\r\nceiling, and the descent of the Holy Spirit in the refectory, which is\r\namong the finest specimens of art in the fourteenth century. On one of\r\nthe walls he painted the Sciences, and under each some one of its\r\ncelebrated professors; and demonstrated his excellence in this species\r\nof allegorical painting, which approaches so nearly to poetry. The\r\nbrilliance and clearness of his tints are chiefly conspicuous in that\r\nchapter house. The royal gallery contains the taking down of Christ, the\r\nwork of his hands, which was formerly at Orsanmichele, and by some\r\nascribed to Buffalmacco, merely because it was unascertained. Taddeo\r\nflourished beyond the term assigned him by Vasari, and outlived most of\r\nthose already named. This may be collected from Franco Sacchetti, a\r\ncontemporary writer, who relates in his 136th Tale, that Andrea Orcagna\r\nproposed as a question, \"who was the greatest master, setting Giotto out\r\nof the question?\" Some answered Cimabue, others Stefano, some Bernardo,\r\nand some Buffalmacco. Taddeo Gaddi, who was in the company, said, \"truly\r\nthese were very able painters, but the art is decaying every day, &c.\"\r\nHe is mentioned up to 1352, and he might possibly survive several years.\r\n\r\nHe left at his death several disciples, who became eminent teachers of\r\npainting in Florence, and other places. D. Lorenzo Camaldolese is\r\nmentioned with honour. He instructed pupils in the art; and several old\r\npictures by him and his scholars are in the monastery of the Angeli. At\r\nthat time the fraternity of Camaldulites furnished some miniature\r\npainters, one of whom, named D. Silvestro, ornamented missals, which\r\nstill exist, and are amongst the best that Italy possesses. The most\r\nfavoured pupils of Taddeo were Giovanni da Milano, whom I shall notice\r\nin the school of Lombardy, and Jacopo di Casentino, who also will find a\r\nplace there, together with his imitators. To these two he recommended on\r\nhis death-bed his two sons and disciples: Giovanni, who died\r\nprematurely, with a reputation for genius; and Angiolo, who being then\r\nvery young, most needed a protector. The latter died, according to\r\nVasari, at 63 years of age; in 1589, according to the date of\r\nBaldinucci. He did not improve the art in proportion to his abilities,\r\nbut contented himself with imitating Giotto and his father, in which he\r\nwas astonishingly successful. The church of S. Pancrazio possessed one\r\npicture by him, containing several saints, and some histories from the\r\nGospel, which may still be seen in the monastery, divided into several\r\npieces, and coloured in a taste superior to what was then usual. There\r\nis another in the same style in the sacristy of the Conventual friars,\r\nby whom he was employed in the choir of the church, to paint in fresco\r\nthe story of the recovery of the Cross, and its transportation in the\r\ntime of Heraclius; a work inferior to the others, because much larger,\r\nand to him somewhat new. He afterwards lived at Venice, as a merchant\r\nrather than as a painter; and Baldinucci, who seizes every opportunity\r\nof supporting his hypothesis, says, that if he was not the founder of\r\nthat school, he, at least, improved it. But I shall demonstrate, in the\r\nproper place, that the Venetian school was advancing to a modern style,\r\nbefore Angiolo could have taught in that place; and in the many old\r\npictures I saw at Venice, I was unable to recal to mind the delicate\r\nstyle of Angiolo. The Venetians owe to him the education of Stefano da\r\nVerona, whom I shall consider in the second volume; and he gave the\r\nFlorentines Cennino Cennini, praised by Vasari as a colourist, of whom\r\nas a writer I shall soon make mention.\r\n\r\nIn the school of Angiolo Gaddi we may reckon Antonio Veneziano,\r\nconcerning whom Vasari and Baldinucci disagree. The former makes him a\r\nVenetian, \"who came to Florence to learn painting of Agnolo Gaddi:\" the\r\nlatter, a systematic writer, as we have seen, asserts that he was born\r\nin Florence, and that he obtained the surname of Veneziano, from his\r\nresidence and many labours in Venice, on the authority of certain\r\nmemoirs in the Strozzi library, which were, perhaps, doubted by himself;\r\nfor had they been of high authority, he would not have omitted to\r\nproclaim their antiquity. However this may be, each of them is a little\r\ninconsistent with himself. As they assert that Antonio died of the\r\nplague in 1384, or, according to the correction of their annotators, in\r\n1383, at the age of 74, it follows that he was born many years before\r\nGaddi, whose disciple, therefore, we cannot easily suppose him. It is\r\nlikewise rendered doubtful by his design in the legends of S.\r\nRanieri,[65] which remain in the Campo Santo of Pisa, where there is a\r\ncertain facility, care, and caprice in the composition, that savour of\r\nanother school. Vasari, moreover, notices a method of painting in\r\nfresco, without ever re-touching it when dry, that would seem to have\r\nbeen introduced from other parts, different from what was employed by\r\nthe Tuscan artists, his competitors, whose paintings, in the time of the\r\nhistorian, were not in as good a state of preservation as those of\r\nAntonio. In the same place he deposited his portrait, which the\r\ndescribers of the ducal gallery at Florence pretend still to find in the\r\nchamber of celebrated artists. This portrait is, however, painted in a\r\nmanner so modern, that I cannot believe it the work of a painter so\r\nancient. On this occasion I must observe that there was another Antonio\r\nVeneziano, whom this picture probably represents, and who, about the\r\nyear 1500, painted, at Osimo, a picture of St. Francis, in the manner of\r\nthat age, and inscribed it with his name. I learned this from the\r\naccomplished Sig. Cav. Aqua, who added, that this name had been erased,\r\nand that of Pietro Perugino inserted, who certainly gains no very great\r\nhonour by such substitution.\r\n\r\nWe learn from history[66] that Antonio educated in Paolo Uccello, a\r\ngreat artist in perspective; and in Gherardo Starnina, a master in the\r\ngay style, of whom there are yet some remnants, in a chapel of the\r\nchurch of Santa Croce. They are among the last efforts of the school of\r\nGiotto, which succeeding artists abandoned, to adopt a better manner.\r\nOne exception occurs in Antonio Vite, who executed some works in the old\r\nstyle, in Pistoia, his native city, and in Pisa. I may here observe,\r\nthat Starnina and Dello Fiorentino shortly after introduced the new\r\nItalian manner in the court of Spain, and returned to Florence with\r\nhonour and with affluence. The first remained to enjoy them in his\r\nnative country, until the time of his death: the latter returned back to\r\nincrease them; and, according to Vasari, he left no public work in\r\nFlorence, except an historic design of Isaac, in green earth, in a\r\ncloister of the church of S. Maria Novella: perhaps he ought to have\r\nsaid, that he left various works, for several are there visible, all in\r\nthe same taste, and so rude, as to induce us to reckon him rather a\r\nfollower of Buffalmacco than of Giotto. But he excelled in small pieces;\r\nand there was none then living who could more elegantly ornament\r\ncabinets, coffers, the backs of couches, or other household furniture,\r\nwith subjects from history and fable.\r\n\r\nAmong the disciples of Taddeo Gaddi I have named Jacopo del Casentino,\r\nof whom there are some remains in the church of Orsanmichele. Jacopo\r\ntaught Spinello Aretino, a man of a most lively fancy, as may be\r\ngathered from some of his pictures in Arezzo, no less than from his\r\nlife. He painted also at Florence, and was one of those who had the\r\nhonour of ornamenting the Campo Santo of Pisa with historical paintings.\r\nHis pictures of the martyrs S. Petito and S. Epiro, are noticed by\r\nVasari as his best performances. He was, however, inferior to his\r\ncompetitors by the meanness of his design, and the style of his\r\ncolouring, in which green and black are predominant, without being\r\nsufficiently relieved by other colours. The fall of the angels still\r\nremains in S. Angelo at Arezzo, in which Lucifer is represented so\r\nterrible, that it afterwards haunted the dreams of the artist, and,\r\nderanging both his mind and body, hastened his death. Bernardo Daddi was\r\nhis scholar; a man less known in his own country than at Florence, where\r\nhe executed a picture, seen on the gate of San Giorgio (See Moreni, lib.\r\nv. p. 5.); as was also Parri, the son of Spinello, who modernised his\r\nstyle somewhat on the manner of Masolino. The latter excelled in the art\r\nof colouring, but he was barbarous in the drawing of his figures, which\r\nhe made extravagantly long and bending, in order, as he was used to say,\r\nto give them greater spirit. One may see some remains of them at Arezzo\r\nin S. Domenico, and other places. Lorenzo di Bicci of Florence, another\r\nscholar of Spinello, was the Vasari of his time, for the multiplicity,\r\ncelerity, and easy self-complacency, shewn in his labours. The first\r\ncloister of the church of S. Croce retains several specimens, consisting\r\nof the legends of S. Francis; and there is an Assumption on the front,\r\nin which he was assisted by Donatello, while still a young man. Perhaps\r\nhis best work is the fresco, ornamenting the sanctuary of S. Maria\r\nNuova, built by Martin V. about the year 1418. His son Neri is reckoned\r\namong the last followers of Giotto. He lived but a short time; he left,\r\nin S. Romolo, a picture which would not have disgraced his father, and\r\nwhich is certainly more carefully executed than was usual with the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century, sculpture was cultivated at Pisa by as\r\nmany artists as painting was at Florence; but Pisa was not on that\r\naccount destitute of painters worthy of being recorded. Vasari mentions\r\none Vicino, who finished the mosaic begun by Turrita, assisted by Tafi\r\nand Gaddi, and adds, that he was also a painter. Sig. da Morrona says,\r\nthat he retained the old style of his school; which was the case with\r\nmany others, as appears from several old Madonnas upon panels, both of\r\nanonymous and of ascertained painters. Of this sort is that in the old\r\nchurch of Tripalle, and that at S. Matthew's in Pisa. On the first is\r\nthis inscription, _Nerus Nellus de Pisa me pinxit_, 1299: on the second\r\nwe read, _Jacopo di Nicola dipintore detto Gera mi dipinse_. The mode of\r\nexpression is derived from the m'epoiese of the Greeks; to which the old\r\nPisans closely adhered in their paintings, their sculptures, and their\r\nbronzes.[67] Like the other Italians they at length reformed their\r\nstyle, and there, as well as at Florence and Siena, families of painters\r\narose, in which the fathers were excelled by their sons, and they by\r\ntheir children. Thus, from Vanni, who flourished in 1300, sprung Turino\r\ndi Vanni, who flourished about 1343, and Nello di Vanni, who painted in\r\nthe Campo Santo, whose son Bernardo was the disciple of Orcagna, and\r\nfurnished many pictures for the palace of the primate. There was also in\r\nthat city one Andrea di Lippo, who is noticed in the _Academical\r\nDiscourse on the literary history of Pisa_, in the year 1336; the same,\r\nI believe, with that Andrea da Pisa, mentioned among the artists that\r\nornamented the cathedral of Orvieto in 1346. A work by one Giovanni di\r\nNiccolo remains in the monastery of S. Martha, and, perhaps, he painted\r\nthe fine trittico of the Zelada museum at Rome, which represents our\r\nSaviour with S. Stephen, S. Agatha, and other saints, and which has this\r\ninscription, _Jo. de Pisis pinxit_. This is a picture of great labour,\r\nby some ascribed to Gio. Balducci; which, if it was ascertained, would\r\nconfer honour on that great man, as a professor of the three sister\r\narts. Towards the end of the century the power of the Pisans declined,\r\nrather from civil discord than from other misfortunes; till at length\r\nthe city fell into the hands of the Florentines in 1406, and lay for a\r\nlong time prostrate and humbled, deprived, not only of her artists, but\r\nalmost of her citizens; and fully glutted the ancient hatred of her\r\nhostile neighbours. She at length rose again, not, indeed, to command,\r\nbut to more dignified subjection.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the Florentines in the mean time increasing with their\r\npower, they became chiefly solicitous to suit the magnificence of their\r\ncapital to the grandeur of the state. Cosmo, at once the father of his\r\ncountry and of men of genius, gave stability to public affairs. Lorenzo\r\nthe Magnificent, and others of the house of Medici, followed, whose\r\nhereditary taste for literature and the fine arts is celebrated in a\r\nmultitude of books, and most copiously in the histories written by three\r\neminent authors, Monsignor Fabroni, the Signor Ab. Galluzzi, and Mr.\r\nRoscoe. Their house was at once a lyceum for philosophers, an arcadia\r\nfor poets, and an academy for artists. Dello, Paolo, Masaccio, the two\r\nPeselli, both the Lippi, Benozzo, Sandro, the Ghirlandai, enjoyed the\r\nperpetual patronage of this family, and as constantly rendered it\r\nwhatever honour they could bestow. Their pictures are full of portraits,\r\naccording to the custom of the times, and continually presented to the\r\npeople the likenesses of the Medici, and often represented them with\r\nregal ornaments in their pictures of the Epiphany, as if gradually to\r\nprepare the people to behold the sceptre and royal robe securely\r\nestablished in that house. The good taste of the Medici was seconded by\r\nthat of other citizens, who were then distributed into various\r\ncorporations, according to their place of residence and profession, each\r\nof which strove with reciprocal emulation to decorate their houses and\r\ntheir churches. Besides the desire of public ornament, they were\r\nanimated by religion, which, in what relates to divine worship, is so\r\nwidely spread, not only among the great, but also among the lower orders\r\nof people, that those have a difficulty in believing who have not beheld\r\nit. Their cathedral, a vast fabric, was already reared for the\r\nceremonies of religion, and here and there some other churches arose;\r\nthese and the more ancient, in emulation of each other, they adorned\r\nwith paintings, a luxury unknown to their ancestors, and less common in\r\nthe other cities of Italy. This disposition gave rise, after the\r\nconclusion of the century, to that prodigious number of painters already\r\nmentioned; and hence sprang, in the century we now treat of, that crowd\r\nof artists in marble, bronze, and silver, who transferred pre-eminence\r\nin sculpture, the ancient inheritance of the Pisans, to the people of\r\nFlorence. The Florentines were desirous of ornamenting the new cathedral\r\nand baptistery, the church of Orsanmichele, and other sacred places,\r\nwith statues and basso-relievos. These brought forward Donatello,\r\nBrunelleschi, Ghiberti, Filarete, Rossellini, Pollajuoli, and\r\nVerrocchio, and produced those noble works in marble, in bronze, and in\r\nsilver, which sometimes appear to have attained the perfection of the\r\nart, and to have rivalled the ancients. The rising generation was\r\ninstructed in design by those celebrated men, and the universality of\r\nthe principles they taught, made the transition from one art to another\r\neasy. The same individuals were often statuaries, founders in bronze, in\r\ngold, lapidaries, painters, or architects, talents that appear enviable\r\nto this age, in which an artist with difficulty acquires a competent\r\nknowledge in a single art. Such was the course of instruction at\r\nFlorence in the Studies, and such the subsequent encouragement without,\r\nfrom which it will not appear wonderful to the reader that this city was\r\nthe foremost to attain the perfection of the art. But let us trace the\r\nsteps by which it advanced in Florence, and in the rest of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Giotto had now carried painting beyond the period of\r\nits infancy, but it continued to give proofs of its infant faculties,\r\nespecially in chiaroscuro, and still more in perspective. Figures\r\nsometimes appeared as if falling or slipping from the canvass; buildings\r\nhad not a true point of view; and the art of foreshortening was yet very\r\nrude. Stefano Fiorentino perceived rather than removed the difficulty;\r\nothers for the most part sought either to avoid or to compensate for the\r\ndeficiency. Pietro della Francesca, whom we have elsewhere noticed,\r\nappears to have been the first who revived the Grecian practice of\r\nrendering geometry subservient to the painter. He is celebrated by\r\nPascoli,[68] and by authors of greater note, as the father of\r\nperspective. Brunelleschi was the first Florentine who saw the method of\r\nbringing it to perfection, \"which consisted in drawing it in outline by\r\nthe help of intersections;\"[69] and in this manner he drew the square of\r\nSt. John, and other places, with true diminution and with receding\r\npoints. He was imitated in mosaic by Benedetto da Maiano, and in\r\npainting by Masaccio, to both of whom he was master. About the same\r\nperiod Paolo Uccello, having studied under Gio. Manetti, a celebrated\r\nmathematician, applied to it with assiduity; and even so dedicated\r\nhimself to the pursuit, that in labouring to excel in this, he never\r\nacquired celebrity in the other branches of painting. He delighted in it\r\nfar beyond his other studies, and used to say that perspective was the\r\nmost pleasant of all; so true is it that novelty is a great source of\r\nenjoyment. He executed no work that did not reflect some new light on\r\nthat art, whether it consisted of edifices and colonnades, in which a\r\ngreat space was represented in a small compass, or of figures\r\nforeshortened with a skill unknown to the followers of Giotto. Some of\r\nhis historic pictures of Adam, and of Noah, in which he indulged in his\r\nfavourite taste for the novel and whimsical, remain in the cloisters of\r\nS. Maria Novella; and there are also landscapes with trees and animals\r\nso well executed, that he might be called the Bassano of the first age.\r\nHe particularly delighted to have birds in his house, from which he\r\ndrew, and from thence he obtained his surname of Uccello. In the\r\ncathedral there is a gigantic portrait of Gio. Aguto on horseback,\r\npainted by Paolo in green earth. This was, perhaps, the first attempt\r\nmade in painting, which achieved a great deal without appearing too\r\ndaring. He produced other specimens at Padua, where he delineated some\r\nfigures of giants with green earth in the house of the Vitali. He was\r\nchiefly employed in ornamenting furniture for private individuals; the\r\ntriumphs of Petrarch in the royal gallery, painted on small cabinets are\r\nsupposed by some good judges to be his.\r\n\r\nMasolino da Panicale cultivated the art of chiaroscuro. I believe he\r\nderived advantage from having long dedicated his attention to modelling\r\nand sculpture, a practice which renders relief easy to the painter,\r\nbeyond what is generally conceived. Ghiberti had been his master in this\r\nbranch, who at this time was unrivalled in design, in composition, and\r\nin giving animation to his figures. Colouring, which he yet wanted, was\r\ntaught him by Starnina, and in this also he became a very celebrated\r\nmaster. Thus uniting in himself the excellences of two schools, he\r\nproduced a new style, not indeed exempt from dryness, nor wholly\r\nfaultless; but grand, determined, and harmonious, beyond any former\r\nexample. The chapel of St. Peter al Carmine, is a remaining monument of\r\nthis artist. He there painted the Evangelists, and some acts of the\r\nSaint, as his vocation to the apostleship, the tempest, the denying of\r\nChrist, the miracle performed at Porta Speciosa, and the Preaching. He\r\nwas prevented by death from representing other acts of St. Peter, as for\r\ninstance, the tribute paid to Caesar, baptism conferred on the multitude,\r\nthe healing of the sick, which several years afterwards were painted by\r\nhis scholar Maso di S. Giovanni, a youth who obtained the surname of\r\nMasaccio, from trusting to a precarious subsistence, and living, as it\r\nwas said, by chance, while deeply engrossed with the studies of his\r\nprofession. This artist was a genius calculated to mark an era in\r\npainting; and Mengs has assigned him the highest place among those who\r\nexplored its untried recesses. Vasari informs us that \"what was executed\r\nbefore his time might be called paintings, but that his pictures seem to\r\nlive, they are so true and natural;\" and in another place adds, that \"no\r\nmaster of that age so nearly approached the moderns.\" He had formed the\r\nprinciples of his art on the works of Ghiberti and Donatello;\r\nperspective he acquired from Brunelleschi, and on going to Rome it\r\ncannot be doubted that he improved by the study of ancient sculpture. He\r\nthere met with two senior artists, Gentile da Fabriano, and Vittore\r\nPisanello, upon whom high encomiums, as the first painter of his time,\r\nmay be seen in Maffei and elsewhere.[70] They who write thus had either\r\nnot seen any of the paintings of Masaccio, or at most only his early\r\nproductions; such as the S. Anna in the church of S. Ambrose in\r\nFlorence, or the chapel of S. Catherine in S. Clement's at Rome, in\r\nwhich, while still young, he executed some pictures of the passion of\r\nChrist, and legends of S. Anna, to which may be added a ceiling\r\ncontaining the Evangelists, which are all that now remain free from\r\nretouching. This work is excellent for that time, but some doubt whether\r\nit ought to be ascribed to him; and it is inferior to his painting in\r\nthe Carmine, of which we may say with Pliny, _jam perfecta sunt omnia_.\r\nThe positions and foreshortenings of the figures are diversified and\r\ncomplete beyond those practised by Paolo Uccello. The air of the heads,\r\nsays Mengs, is in the style of Raffaello; the expression is so managed\r\nthat the mind seems no less forcibly depicted than the body. The anatomy\r\nof the figure is marked with truth and judgment. That figure, so highly\r\nextolled in the baptism of S. Peter, which appears shivering with cold,\r\nmarks, as it were, an era in the art. The garments, divested of\r\nminuteness, present a few easy folds. The colouring is true, properly\r\nvaried, delicate, and surprisingly harmonious; the relief is in the\r\ngrandest style. This chapel was not finished by him. He died in 1443,\r\nnot without suspicion of poison, and left it still deficient in several\r\npictures, which, after many years were supplied by the younger Lippi. It\r\nbecame the school of all the best Florentine artists whom we shall have\r\noccasion to notice in this and the succeeding epoch, of Pietro Perugino,\r\nand even of Raffaello; and it is a curious circumstance, that in the\r\ncourse of many years, in a city fruitful in genius, ever bent on the\r\npromotion of the art, no one in following the footsteps of Masaccio\r\nattained that eminence which he acquired without a director. Time has\r\ndefaced other works of his hand at Florence, equally commended, and\r\nespecially the sanctuary of the church del Carmine, of which there is a\r\ndrawing in the possession of the learned P. Lettor Fontana Barnabita in\r\nPavia. The royal gallery has very few of his works. The portrait of a\r\nyoung man, that seems to breathe, and is estimated at a high price, is\r\nin the Pitti collection.\r\n\r\nAfter Masaccio, two monks distinguished themselves in the Florentine\r\nschool. The first was a Dominican friar named F. Giovanni da Fiesole, or\r\nB. Giovanni Angelico. His first employment was that of ornamenting books\r\nwith miniatures, an art he learned from an elder brother, who executed\r\nminiatures and other paintings. It is said that he studied in the chapel\r\nof Masaccio, but it is not easy to credit this when we consider their\r\nages. Their style too betrays a different origin. The works of the friar\r\ndiscover some traces of the manner of Giotto, in the posture of the\r\nfigures and the compensation for deficiencies in the art, not to mention\r\nthe drapery which is often folded in long tube-like forms, and the\r\nexquisite diligence in minute particulars common to miniature painters.\r\nNor did he depart much from this method in the greatest part of his\r\nworks, which chiefly consist of scripture pieces of our Saviour, or the\r\nVirgin, in cabinet pictures not unfrequently to be met with in Florence.\r\nThe royal gallery possesses several; the most brilliant and highly\r\nfinished of which, is the birth of John the Baptist. The Glory,[71]\r\nwhich is in the church of S. Mary Magdalen de' Pazzi, from its great\r\nsize, is among his rarest productions; and it also ranks with the most\r\nbeautiful. His chief excellence consists in the beauty that adorns the\r\ncountenances of his saints and angels; and he is truly the Guido of the\r\nage, for the sweetness of his colours, which, though in water, he\r\ndiluted and blended in a manner which almost reaches perfection. He was\r\nalso esteemed one of the best of his age in works executed in fresco;\r\nand he was employed in the decoration of the cathedral of Orvieto, as\r\nwell as the palace of the Vatican itself, where he painted a chapel--a\r\nwork much commended by a number of writers. Vasari enumerates Gentile da\r\nFabriano among his disciples, but the dates render this impossible; and\r\nsays the same of Zanobi Strozzi, a man of noble origin, of whom I do not\r\nknow that any certain picture exists in a public collection: I only know\r\nthat, treading in the steps of his master, he surpassed the reputation\r\nof a mere amateur. Benozzo Gozzoli, another of his disciples, and an\r\nimitator of Masaccio, raised himself far above the majority of his\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn a few points he even surpassed his model, as in the stupendous size\r\nof his edifices, in the amenity of his landscapes, and in the brilliancy\r\nof his fancy, truly lively, agreeable, and picturesque. In the Riccardi\r\npalace, once a royal residence, there is a chapel in good preservation,\r\nwhere he executed a Glory, a Nativity, and an Epiphany. He there painted\r\nwith a profusion of gold and of drapery, unexampled, perhaps, in fresco;\r\nand with an adherence to nature that exhibits an image of that age in\r\nthe portraits, the garments, the accoutrements of the horses, and in the\r\nmost minute particulars. He long resided at Pisa, and died there, where\r\nhe ought to be studied; for his compositions in that place are better\r\nthan those at Florence, and he was there also more sparing in the use of\r\ngold. The portrait of S. Thomas Aquinas is highly spoken of by Vasari\r\nand Richardson; but they especially notice the pictures from scripture\r\nhistory, with which he ornamented a whole wing of the Campo Santo, \"a\r\nmost prodigious work, sufficient to appal a legion of painters;\"[72] and\r\nhe finished it within two years. Here he displayed a talent for\r\ncomposition, an imitation of nature, a variety in the countenances and\r\nattitudes, a colouring juicy, lively, and clear, and an expression of\r\nthe passions that places him next to Masaccio. I can scarcely believe\r\nthat he painted the whole. In the Ebriety of Noah, in the Tower of\r\nBabel, and in some other pictures, we discern an attempt at surprising,\r\nnot to be seen in some others, where figures sometimes occur that seem\r\ndry and laboured; defects which I am disposed rather to attribute to his\r\ncoadjutors. Near this great work a monument is erected to his memory by\r\na grateful city, in the public name, with an epitaph that commends him\r\nas a painter. Time itself, as if conscious of his merit, has respected\r\nthis work beyond any other in the Campo Santo.\r\n\r\nThe other monk was Filippo Lippi, a Carmelite, a genius of a different\r\nstamp from B. Giovanni. He received his instruction, not from Masaccio,\r\nas Vasari would have it, but from his works. His assiduity in copying\r\nhim, makes him sometimes appear a second Masaccio, especially in small\r\nhistories. Some of his choicest are in the sacristy of the church of S.\r\nSpirito. In that place, in the Church of S. Ambrose, and elsewhere, his\r\npictures represent the Virgin surrounded by angels, with full and\r\nhandsome countenances, distinguished by a colouring and a gracefulness\r\npeculiarly his own. He delighted in drapery like the neat folds of a\r\nsurplice; his tints were very clear but delicate, and often subdued by a\r\npurple hue not common to other painters. He introduced gigantic\r\nproportions in his large frescos in the parish church of Prato; where\r\nhis pictures of S. Stephen and the Baptist were, in the opinion of\r\nVasari, his capital performances. His forsaking the convent, his slavery\r\nin Barbary, his works at Naples, at Padua, and elsewhere, his death,\r\nhastened by poison, administered by the relations of a young lady who\r\nhad borne him a natural child, likewise named Filippo Lippi, are\r\nrecorded by Vasari. P. della Valle is of opinion that he never\r\n_professed_ any order, but in the register of Carmine, his death is\r\nnoticed in the year 1469, and he is there denominated Fra Filippo. He\r\ndied at Spoleti when he had nearly completed his large picture for the\r\ncathedral. Lorenzo the Magnificent requested his ashes from the\r\ntownsmen, but was refused; on which he caused a handsome monument to be\r\nerected for him, with an inscription by Angelo Poliziano; a circumstance\r\nI mention, to demonstrate the respect paid to the art at that period. F.\r\nDiamante da Prato, the scholar of Lippi, and his assistant in his last\r\nwork, imitated him well; as likewise did Francesco Pesello, a Florentine\r\nof the same school; his son Pesellino, a short lived artist, followed\r\nhim with still greater success. The Epiphany of Francesco, described by\r\nVasari, in which there is a portrait of Donato Acciaiuoli, is in the\r\nroyal gallery. The grado, painted by his son for the apartments of the\r\nnovices of S. Croce, is there still: on this last are the histories of\r\nS. Cosma and S. Damian, of S. Anthony, and S. Francis, denominated by\r\nthe historian most wonderful productions, and, perhaps, this is not too\r\nmuch to say when we recollect the period.\r\n\r\nAbout this time other able artists flourished at Florence, who were\r\nobscured by greater names. Of this number was Berto Linaiuolo, whose\r\npictures in private houses were, for a long time, held in great repute.\r\nThey were even ordered by the King of Hungary, and procured him great\r\nfame in that kingdom. Alessio Baldovinetti, of noble extraction, was a\r\npainter particularly diligent and minute, a good worker in mosaic, and\r\nthe master of Ghirlandaio. In his picture of the Nativity in the porch\r\nof the Nunziata, and in his other works, the design, rather than the\r\ncolouring, may now be said to remain; for the tints have vanished, from\r\na defect in their composition. To them we may add Verrocchio, a\r\ncelebrated statuary, a good designer, and a painter for amusement rather\r\nthan by profession. While he painted the Baptism of Christ at S. Salvi,\r\nhis scholar, L. da Vinci, then a youth, finished an angel, in a manner\r\nsuperior to the figures of his master, who, indignant at his own\r\ninferiority to a boy, never more handled the pencil.\r\n\r\nBaldinucci imagines that Andrea del Castagno, a name infamous in\r\nhistory, was a scholar of Masaccio: he was rather his imitator, in\r\nattitude, relief, and casting of the drapery, than in grace and\r\ncolouring. He lived at the time that the secret of painting in oil\r\n(discovered by John Van Eych, or John of Bruges, about 1410),[73] was\r\nknown in Italy, not only by report, but by experience of the advantages\r\nof this method. Our artists, admiring the harmony, delicacy, and\r\nbrilliance, which colours received from this discovery, sighed to\r\npossess the secret. For this purpose, one Antonello da Messina, who had\r\nstudied at Rome, travelled to Flanders, and having learned the secret,\r\naccording to Vasari, from the inventor, went to Venice, where he\r\ncommunicated it to a friend named Domenico. After having practised much\r\nin his own country, at Loreto,[74] and other parts of the ecclesiastical\r\nstates, Domenico came to Florence. There he became the general\r\nfavourite, and on that account was envied by Castagna, whose dissembled\r\nfriendship won him to impart the secret, and rewarded him by an\r\natrocious assassination, which he perpetrated, in order that there might\r\nbe none living to rival him in the art. The assassin was sufficiently\r\nskilful to conceal his crime, owing to which a number of innocent\r\npersons soon fell under suspicion, which did not induce the real\r\ncriminal to avow the atrocious deed, until he lay upon his death-bed,\r\nwhen he disclosed his guilt and did justice to the innocence of others.\r\nHe had the reputation of being the first artist of his time, for vigour,\r\nfor design, and for perspective, having perfected the art of\r\nforeshortening. His finest works have perished: one of his pictures\r\nremains at S. Lucia de' Magnuoli, and also some of his historic pieces,\r\nexecuted with great diligence. There is also a Crucifixion, painted on a\r\nwall in the monastery of the Angeli.\r\n\r\nMany writers have appeared who deny the above mentioned statement of\r\nVasari, and maintain that the art of painting in oil was known long\r\nbefore. It is pretended that it existed in the time of the Romans, an\r\nopinion that is adopted by Sig. Ranza, in regard to a picture _said to\r\nbe of S. Helena_, consisting of a quilting of different pieces of silk\r\nstitched together, exhibiting a picture of the Virgin Saint with the\r\nInfant. The heads and hands are coloured in oils; the drapery is shaded\r\nwith the needle, and in a great measure with the pencil. It is preserved\r\nin Vercelli, and from the tradition of its citizens reported by Mabillon\r\n(Diar. Ital. Cap. 28), it is said to be the work of S. Helena, mother of\r\nConstantine; that is, the patches of silk were sewed by her, and the\r\ngilding and painting added to it by her painter, as is conjectured by\r\nRanza. He was not aware that the practice of drawing the Infant Christ\r\nin the lap of the Virgin (as we notice in the preface to the Roman\r\nschool), was posterior to the fourth century; and that other particulars\r\nrelated by him of the picture cannot belong to the age of Constantine;\r\nfor instance, the hooded mantle of our Lady. From such signs we ought\r\nrather to conclude that it is either not an oil painting, or that the\r\nfigure, at whatever period executed, has been retouched in the same way\r\nas that of the Nunziata at Florence, or of the Santa Maria Primerana at\r\nFiesole; the former of which in the drapery, and the latter in the\r\nlineaments, are not the same now as in their ancient state.\r\n\r\nOthers, without ascending to the first ages of the church, have asserted\r\nthat oil painting was known out of Italy, at least as early as the\r\neleventh century. As a proof of this, they adduce a manuscript of the\r\nMonk Teofilo or Ruggiero, no later back than that period, which bears\r\ntitle, \"De omni scientia artis pingendi,\" where there is a receipt for\r\nthe preparation and use of oil from flax.[75] Lessing gave an account of\r\nthis manuscript in the year 1774, in a treatise published at Brunswick,\r\nwhere he filled the office of librarian to the Prince. Morelli, also, in\r\nthe Codici Naniani (cod. 39); and more at length Raspe, in his critical\r\n\"Dissertation on Oil Painting,\" published in the English language at\r\nLondon, in which he enumerated the existing copies in various libraries,\r\nand gave a great part of the manuscript, entered into an examination of\r\nthe subject. Lastly, Teofilo's treatise is inserted by Christiano Leist,\r\nin Lessing's collection, \"Zur Geschichte unde Litteratur.\" Brusw. 1781.\r\nThe Dottore Aglietti, in his Giornale Veneto, December, 1793, likewise\r\nadds his opinion; while the learned Abbate Morelli, in his \"Notizia,\"\r\nwhich is often cited by me in the emendation and illustration of this\r\nedition, throws the greatest light upon the present question, agitated\r\nby so many, and, we may add, \"rem acu tetigit.\" He, then, will be found\r\nto concede to Giovanni, whom he calls Gianes da Brugia, the boast of\r\nthis great discovery, agreeing with Vasari, though in a different sense\r\nfrom that in which the latter writer views it. For he does not reply to\r\nhis opponents, that the art of painting, as taught by Teofilo, might\r\nhave gone into disuse, and was only revived by Giovanni; whence Vasari\r\nventured to commend him as an original inventor; in the same manner as\r\nTiraboschi replied, who followed the Roman anthologists (St. Lett. t.\r\nvi. p. 1202). Neither does he bring forward the defence advanced by the\r\nBaron de Budberg in the apology of Gio. da Bruges,[76] to the purport\r\nthat Teofilo taught the art of painting in oil, only upon a ground,\r\nwithout figures, and without ornaments: because Teofilo, in chap. 22,\r\nwhose words we have given in the note, likewise taught this art. Into\r\nwhat, then, does the long-boasted invention of Giovanni resolve itself?\r\nNothing more than this: according to the ancient practice, a fresh\r\ncolour was never added to the panel until the first covering had been\r\ndried in the sun: a mode, as Teofilo confesses, infinitely tedious:\r\n\"quod in imaginibus diuturnum et taediosum nimis est;\" (cap. 23); to\r\nwhich I may add, that the colours in this way could never perfectly\r\nharmonize. Van Eych saw this difficulty, and he became more truly\r\nsensible of it, from the circumstance of having exposed one of his\r\npaintings to the sun, in order to harden, when the excess of heat split\r\nthe panel. Being at that period sufficiently skilled both in\r\nphilosophical and philological inquiries, he began to speculate on the\r\nmanner of applying oils, and of their acquiring a proper consistency\r\nwithout the aid of the sun. \"By uniting it with other mixtures he next\r\nproduced a varnish, which, dried, was water proof, and gave a clearness\r\nand brilliancy, while it added to the harmony of his colours.\" Such are\r\nthe words of Vasari; and thus, in a very few words, we may arrive at a\r\nsatisfactory solution of the question. Before the time of Van Eych, some\r\nsort of method of painting in oil was known, but so extremely tedious\r\nand imperfect, as to be scarcely applicable to the production of figure\r\npieces. It was practised beyond the Alps, but is not known to have been\r\nin use in Italy. Giovanni carried the first discovery to its completion;\r\nhe perfected the art, which was afterwards diffused over all Europe, and\r\nintroduced into Italy, by means of Antonio, or Antonello da Messina.\r\n\r\nHere again we are met by another class of objectors, who enter the lists\r\nagainst Van Eych, against Antonello, and more decidedly against Vasari,\r\nnot with arguments from books, but in the strength of pictorial skill,\r\nand chemical experiments.\r\n\r\nMalvasia, upon the authority of Tiarini, maintains, that Lippo Dalmasio\r\npainted in oil; the Neapolitans, relying upon Marco da Siena, and other\r\nmen of skill, assert the same of their artists in the thirteenth\r\ncentury; while a few have pretended that some of the pictures[77]\r\nproduced in the fourteenth century, to be seen at Siena and Modena, in\r\nparticular that from the hand of Tommaso da Modena, belonging to the\r\nImperial cabinet, and described by me in the native school of that\r\nartist, are also coloured in oil; because, after being exposed to water,\r\nand analyzed, the colours discovered their elements, and were pronounced\r\noil. In spite, however, of so much skill, and so many experiments, I\r\ncannot see that Vasari has yet been detected in an error. It would not\r\nbe difficult to oppose other experiments and opinions, that might throw\r\nlight upon the question. To begin with Tuscany:--an analysis of several\r\nTuscan paintings was made at Pisa by the very able chemist Bianchi; and\r\nthough apparently coloured in oil, the most lucid parts were found to\r\ngive out particles of wax; a material employed in the _encausti_, and\r\nnot forgotten by the Greeks, who instructed Giunta and his\r\ncontemporaries. It would appear that they applied it as a varnish, to\r\nact as a covering and protection from humidity, as well as to give a\r\nlucid hue and polish to the colours. It has been observed, that the\r\nproportion of wax employed greatly decreased during the fourteenth\r\ncentury; and after the year 1360 fell into disuse, and was succeeded by\r\na vehicle, that carries no gloss. But in these experiments oil was never\r\nelicited, if we except a few drops of essential oil, which the learned\r\nprofessor conjectures was employed at that early period to dissolve the\r\nwax made use of in painting.\r\n\r\nBesides this material, certain gums, and yolks of eggs, which easily\r\ndeceive the eye of the less skilful, were also used, and very nearly\r\nresemble those pictures that display a scanty portion of oil, as is\r\nobserved by Zanetti, in his account of Venetian painting (p. 20); and\r\nthe analysis of Tommaso da Modena's picture has tended to confirm his\r\nopinion. This information I owe to the late Count Durazzo, who, in 1793,\r\nassured me, when at Venice, that he had himself beheld, at Vienna, the\r\nprocess of analyzing such pictures, by very skilful hands, at the\r\ncommand, and in the presence of Prince Kaunitz; and that it was the\r\nunanimous opinion of those professors, that no traces of oil were to be\r\nfound. The colours consisted of the finest gums, mixed with the yolk and\r\nwhite of eggs, a fact that afforded just ground for a like conclusion in\r\nregard to similar works by the ancients. I fully appreciate, likewise,\r\nthe opinion of Piacenza upon the celebrated picture of Colantonio; this\r\nI reserve, however, together with some further reflections of my own,\r\nfor the school of Naples.\r\n\r\nI shall here merely inform the reader, that, in regard to the chemical\r\nexperiments employed on these paintings, Sig. da Morrona[78] observes,\r\nthat old pictures are often believed to be in a state of purity, when\r\nthey have been retouched with oil colours at a subsequent period: the\r\nuse of wax, and of essential oils, or of some such old methods, may\r\nfrequently give rise to doubt, as I shall soon shew.\r\n\r\nHaving removed the objections brought against the opinion of Vasari, I\r\nmust add a few words in regard to a passage where he seems to have\r\nforgotten what he had said in the life of Angiol Gaddi, but which will\r\nin fact throw further light upon the question. He is giving an account\r\nof the paintings and writings of Andrea Cennini, a scholar of Angelo.\r\nThis person, in 1437, that is, long before the arrival of Domenico,\r\ncomposed a work on painting, which is preserved in MS. in the library of\r\nS. Lorenzo. He there treated, says Vasari, of grinding colours with oil,\r\nfor making red, blue, and green grounds; and various new methods and\r\nsizes for gilding, but not figures. Baldinucci examined the same\r\nmanuscript, and found these words in the 89th chapter:--\"I wish to teach\r\nthee how to paint in oil on walls, or on panel, as practised by many\r\nGermans;\" and on consulting the manuscript, I find, after that passage,\r\n\"and by the same method on iron and on marble; but I shall first treat\r\nof painting on walls.\" In the succeeding chapters he says, that this\r\nmust be accomplished \"by boiling linseed oil.\" This appears not to\r\naccord with the assertion of Vasari, that John of Bruges, after many\r\nexperiments, \"discovered that linseed oil and nut oil were the most\r\ndrying. When boiled with his other ingredients they formed the varnish\r\nso long sought after by him and all other painters.\" On weighing the\r\nevidence, we should, in my opinion, take three circumstances into\r\nconsideration: The first is, that Vasari does not deny that oil was\r\nemployed in painting; since he affirms that it was long a desideratum,\r\nand consequently had been often attempted; but that alone is perfect\r\nwhich, \"when dry, resists water; which brightens the colours, makes them\r\nclear, and perfectly unites them.\" 2. The oil of Cennini might not be of\r\nthis sort, either because it was not boiled with the ingredients of Van\r\nEych, or because it was intended only for coarse work; a circumstance\r\nrendered probable by the fact, that though he painted the Virgin, with\r\nseveral Saints, in the hospital of Bonifazio, at Florence, \"in a good\r\nstyle of colouring,\" yet he never excited the admiration nor the envy of\r\nartists. 3. The above remarks forbid us to give implicit confidence to\r\nevery relation that is given of ancient oil pictures; but we are not\r\nblindly to reject all accounts of imperfect attempts of that nature.\r\nAfter this digression we return to our narrative.\r\n\r\nThe painters that remain to be noticed, approach the golden age of the\r\nart, of which their works in some degree participate, notwithstanding\r\nthe dryness of their design, and the general want of harmony in their\r\ncolouring. The vehicle of their colours was commonly water, very rarely\r\noil. They flourished in the time of Sixtus IV., who, having erected the\r\nmagnificent chapel that retains his name, invited them from Florence.\r\nTheir names are Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Rosselli, Luca da Cortona, and\r\nD. Bartolommeo d'Arezzo; whom I shall here introduce, together with\r\ntheir followers. Manni, the historian of some of these artists,[79]\r\nconjectures that this work was executed about the year 1474. They were\r\ndesired to pourtray the history of Moses on one part of the chapel, and\r\nthat of Christ on the other: thus the old law was confronted by the new,\r\nthe shade by the light, and the type by the person typified. The pontiff\r\nwas unskilled in the fine arts, but covetous of the glory they confer on\r\nthe name and actions of princes. To superintend the work, he made choice\r\nof Sandro Filipepi, from his first master, a goldsmith, surnamed\r\nBotticelli, and the pupil of F. Filippo; a celebrated artist at that\r\ntime, and distinguished by his pictures containing a great number of\r\nsmall figures in which he strongly resembled Andrea Mantegna; though his\r\nheads were less beautiful. Vasari says, that his little picture of the\r\nCalumny of Apelles, is as fine a production as possible, and he\r\npronounces the Assumption, painted for the church of S. Pier Maggiore,\r\nto be so excellent, that it ought to silence envy. The former is in the\r\nroyal gallery, the latter in a private house. What he painted in the\r\nSistine Chapel, however, surpasses all his other works. Here we scarcely\r\nrecognize Sandro of Florence. The Temptation of Christ, embellished with\r\na magnificent temple, and a crowd of devotees in the vestibule; Moses\r\nassisting the daughters of Jethro against the Midianite shepherds, in\r\nwhich there is great richness of drapery, coloured in a new manner; and\r\nother subjects, treated with vigour and originality, exhibit him in this\r\nplace greatly superior to his usual manner. The same observation applies\r\nto the painters we are about to notice: such were the effects produced\r\nby their emulation; by the sight of a city that is calculated to enlarge\r\nthe ideas of those who visit it, and by the judgment of a public that is\r\nscarcely to be satisfied by what is above mediocrity, because its eye is\r\nhabituated to what is wonderful.\r\n\r\nHistory does not point out the portion of this work that was performed\r\nby Filippino Lippi; the son, as we have already observed, of F. Filippo.\r\nIt is however highly probable that he assisted; because he was his\r\nfather's pupil from a very early age, and because the taste of Lippi,\r\nthat delighted in portraying the usages of antiquity in his pictures,\r\nappears to have been formed while he was still young, and engaged in his\r\nstudies at Rome. In the life which Cellini has written of himself, he\r\ntells us that he had seen several books of antiquities drawn by Lippi;\r\nand Vasari gives him credit for being the first who decorated modern\r\npaintings by the introduction of grotesques, trophies, armour, vases,\r\nedifices and drapery, copied from the models of antiquity; but this I\r\ncannot confirm, because it was before attempted by Squarcione. It is\r\ntrue that he excelled in those ornaments, in his landscape and in minute\r\nparticulars. The S. Bernard of the Abbey, the Magi of the royal museum,\r\nand the two frescos in S. Maria Novella; the one the history of S. John,\r\nthe other of S. Philip, the apostles, please more perhaps by these\r\naccessaries of the art than by the countenances, which, indeed, have not\r\nthe beauty and grace of the elder Lippi. They are faithful portraits,\r\nbut shew no discrimination. He was invited to Rome to ornament a chapel\r\nof the Minerva, in which there is an Assumption by his hand, and some\r\nhistories of Thomas Aquinas, amongst which the Disputation is the best.\r\nIn this chapel he shews great improvement in his heads, but was\r\nnevertheless surpassed in this respect by his pupil Raffaellino del\r\nGarbo, who painted a choir of angels on the ceiling, that would alone\r\nsuffice to justify the name by which he was distinguished. In Monte\r\nOliveto at Florence, there is a Resurrection by Raffaellino, where the\r\nfigures are small, but so graceful withal, so correct in attitude, and\r\nso finely coloured, that we can scarcely rank him inferior to any master\r\nof that age. There is mention made by the learned Moreni, in the\r\nconcluding part of his \"Memorie Istoriche,\" (p. 168) of another of his\r\nbeautiful altar-pieces, still in existence at S. Salvi, with the grado\r\nentire. Some early pictures are in a similar state; but becoming the\r\nfather of a numerous family, he gradually degenerated in his style, and\r\ndied in poverty and obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe second whom I have mentioned among the artists in the Sistine\r\nChapel, is Domenico Corradi, surnamed Del Ghirlandaio, from the\r\nprofession of his father.[80] He was a painter, an excellent worker in\r\nmosaic, and even contributed to the improvement of these arts. He\r\npainted in the Sistine Chapel the Resurrection of Christ, which has\r\nperished; and the Call of S. Peter and S. Andrew, which still remains.\r\nHe is that Ghirlandaio, in whose school, or on whose manner, not only\r\nRidolfo del Ghirlandaio, his son, but also Bonarruoti, and the best\r\nartists of the succeeding era, formed their style. He possessed\r\nclearness and purity of outline, correctness of form, and variety of\r\nideas, together with facility and uncommon diligence; he was the first\r\nFlorentine, who, by means of true perspective, attained a happy method\r\nof grouping, and depth of composition.[81] He was among the first to\r\nreject the deep golden fringes to the drapery, that the old masters\r\nintroduced; who, unable to render their figures beautiful, endeavoured,\r\nat least, to make them gaudy. Some of his pictures, however, yet remain,\r\nmoderately illuminated with gold; as for instance, the Epiphany in the\r\nchurch of the Innocents at Florence. It is a fine work, as is also his\r\nchapel in the Holy Trinity, with the actions of S. Francis, and his\r\nNativity, in the sacristy of that church. His most celebrated work is\r\nthe choir of S. Maria Novella, on one side of which he designed the\r\nhistory of John the Baptist, on the other that of our Lady, and on\r\nanother part the murder of the Innocents, so much commended by Vasari.\r\nIt contains a vast many portraits of literary men, and noble citizens,\r\nand almost every head is from the life; but they are dignified, and\r\njudiciously selected. The hands and feet of the figures, however, do not\r\ncorrespond, and attention to this circumstance is the peculiar merit of\r\nAndrea del Sarto, who seems to have carried the manner of Ghirlandaio to\r\nperfection. Many works of the latter are scattered over Italy, in Rome,\r\nin Rimini, and at Pisa, at the Eremitani di Pietra Santa, and the\r\nCamaldolesi of Volterra; where besides the paintings in the refectory,\r\nthere is in the church a figure of S. Romualdo, carved by Diana of\r\nMantua. The pictures of this master should not be confounded with those\r\nof his scholars, as happens in many instances. Thus the holy families\r\npainted by his brothers or his scholars, frequently pass for his; but\r\nthey are very far from meriting the praise we have justly bestowed on\r\nhim. Davide, one of his brothers, became very eminent in mosaic;\r\nanother, Benedetto, painted more in France than in Italy; Bastiano\r\nMainardi, their brother-in-law, was rather the assistant of Domenico,\r\nthan a painter of originality. Baldino Bandinelli, Niccolo Cieco, Jacopo\r\ndel Tedesco, and Jacopo Indaco, are little known; except that the last\r\nis recorded as having assisted with Pinturicchio, at Rome, and was the\r\nbrother of Francesco, better known as a painter at Montepulciano than in\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nCosimo Rosselli, whose noble family has produced several other artists,\r\nalso wrought in the Sistine Chapel. Few of his works remain in public\r\nplaces in his own country, besides the miracle of the sacrament in the\r\nchurch of S. Ambrose, a fresco picture, full of portraits; in which we\r\ndiscover variety, character, and truth. Vasari praises his labours at\r\nRome, less than those of his fellow artists. Being unable to rival his\r\ncompetitors in design, he loaded his pictures with brilliant colours and\r\ngilded ornaments, which, though it was at that time condemned by an\r\nimproving taste, yet pleased the pontiff, who commended and rewarded him\r\nbeyond all the other artists. Perhaps his best work there, is Christ\r\npreaching on the mount, in which the landscape is said to be the work of\r\nPier di Cosimo, a painter likewise more remarkable for his colouring\r\nthan his design; as is evident from a picture in the church of the\r\nInnocents, and his Perseus in the royal gallery. They are both, however,\r\ncelebrated in history; the one as the master of del Porta, the other of\r\nAndrea del Sarto.\r\n\r\nNo other Florentine was employed to paint in the Sistine Chapel; but\r\nPiero and Antonio Pollaiuoli, who were both statuaries and painters,\r\ncame there not long afterwards and wrought in bronze the tomb of Sixtus\r\nIV. Some of their paintings may yet be seen in the church of S. Miniato,\r\nwithout the walls of Florence, and the altar-piece was transferred to\r\nthe royal museum. We may there trace the school of Castagno, the master\r\nof Piero, in the harsh features, coloured in a strong and juicy manner.\r\nAntonio, the scholar of Piero, became one of the best painters of that\r\nage. In the chapel of the Marchesi Pucci, at the church of St.\r\nSebastiano de' Servi, there is a martyrdom of the saint by him, which is\r\none of the best pictures of the fifteenth century I have ever seen. The\r\ncolouring is not in the best style; but the composition rises above the\r\nage in which he lived, and the drawing of the naked figure shews what\r\nattention he had bestowed on anatomy. He was the first Italian painter\r\nwho dissected bodies in order to learn the true situations of the\r\ntendons and muscles. Both the Pollaiuoli died at Rome, where their tomb\r\nis to be seen in S. Piero in Vincoli, ornamented with a picture, which,\r\naccording to some, typifies a soul in purgatory, and the efficacy of\r\nindulgences to deliver it; but whether it is by them, or of their\r\nschool, I am unable to determine.\r\n\r\nThe two following artists were brought to the Sistine Chapel from the\r\nFlorentine territory, the painters of which I shall now consider after\r\nthose of the capital. Luca Signorelli, the kinsman of Vasari of Arezzo,\r\nand the disciple of Piero della Francesca, was a spirited and expressive\r\npainter, and one of the first Tuscan artists who designed figures with a\r\ntrue knowledge of anatomy, though somewhat dryly. The cathedral of\r\nOrvieto evinces this; and those naked figures which even Michelangiolo\r\nhas not disdained to imitate. Although in most of his works we do not\r\ndiscover a proper choice of form, nor a sufficient harmony of colouring\r\nin some of them, especially in the communion of the Apostles, painted\r\nfor the Jesuits in his native city, there is beauty, grace, and tints\r\napproaching to modern excellence. He painted in Urbino, at Volterra,\r\nFlorence, and many other cities. In the Sistine Chapel he painted the\r\nJourney of Moses with Sefora, and the Promulgation of the Old Law,\r\npaintings full of incident, and superior in composition to the confused\r\nstyle of that age. Vasari and Taia have assigned him the first place in\r\nthis great assemblage of artists; to me he seems at least to have\r\nequalled the best of them, and to have improved on his usual style. He\r\nhad two countrymen of noble families for pupils; Tommaso Bernabei, who\r\nfollowed him closely, and has left some works in S. M. del Calcinaio,\r\nand Turpino Zaccagna, whose style was different, as appears from a\r\npicture painted for the Church of S. Agatha in Cantalena near Cortona,\r\nin 1537.\r\n\r\nDon Bartolommeo della Gatta executed none of his own designs in the\r\nSistine Chapel; he lent assistance to Signorelli and to Perugino. He had\r\nbeen educated in the monastery of the Angeli, at Florence, rather as a\r\npainter of miniatures than of history. On being appointed Abbot of S.\r\nClement, in Arezzo, he exercised both; and was also skilled in music and\r\nin architecture. There is of his works only a S. Jerome, executed in the\r\nchapel of the cathedral, as we find from a MS. guide to the city, and\r\nwhich was transferred into the sacristy in 1794. The abbot instructed\r\nDomenico Pecori and Matteo Lappoli, two gentlemen of Arezzo, who\r\nimproved themselves in the art on other models, especially the first, as\r\nis evident from a picture in the parish church, in which the Virgin\r\nreceives under her mantle the people of Arezzo, who are recommended to\r\nher protection by their patron saints. In it are heads in the style of\r\nFrancia, good architecture, judicious composition, and a moderate use of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nTwo miniature painters, according to Vasari, learned much from the\r\nprecepts, or rather from the example of the abbot. These were Girolamo,\r\nalso named by Ridolfi, as a pupil of the Paduan school, at the same time\r\nwith Lancilao; and Vante, or as he subscribed himself, Attavante\r\nFiorentino. Two of his letters are inserted in the third volume of the\r\nLettere Pittoriche; and it may be collected from Vasari and\r\nTiraboschi,[82] that Vante ornamented with miniatures many books for\r\nMatthias, king of Hungary, which afterwards remained in the Medicean and\r\nEstensean libraries. The learned Sig. Ab. Morelli, who has the direction\r\nof the library of S. Mark at Venice, shewed me one in that place. It is\r\na work of Marziano Capella, where the subject is poetically expressed by\r\nthe painter. The assembly of the Gods, the emblems of the arts and\r\nsciences, the grotesque ornaments here and there set off with little\r\nportraits, discover in Vante a genius that admirably seconded the ideas\r\nof the author. The design resembles the best works of Botticelli; the\r\ncolouring is gay, lively, and brilliant; the excellence of the work\r\nought to confer on the artist greater celebrity than he enjoys. In the\r\nlife of D. Bartolommeo, Vasari, or his printers, have confounded\r\nAttavante with Gherardo, the miniature painter, who at the same time was\r\na worker in mosaic, an engraver in the style of Albert Durer, and a\r\npainter; of him there are some remains in each of these arts; but they\r\nwere certainly different individuals, as is demonstrated by Sig.\r\nPiacenza.\r\n\r\nHaving a little before named Pietro Perugino, who long taught in\r\nTuscany, we may here mention the pupils who retained his manner. These\r\nwere Rocco Zoppo, whose Madonnas remain in many private houses in\r\nFlorence, I believe, to this day, and are in the manner of Pietro;\r\nBaccio Ubertini, a great colourist, and on that account willingly\r\nadopted as an assistant of his master; Francesco, the brother of Baccio,\r\nsurnamed Bacchiacca, known at S. Lorenzo by the martyrdom of S.\r\nArcadius, executed in small figures, in which, as well as in the\r\ngrotesque, he was very eminent, and nearly approached the modern style.\r\nTo these artists who lived in Florence, their native country, we may add\r\nNiccolo Soggi, likewise a Florentine, but who, to shun the concourse of\r\nmore able painters, fixed his residence in Arezzo, where he had\r\nsufficient employment. His accuracy, his studious habits, and his high\r\nfinish, may be there contemplated in the Christ in the Manger, in the\r\nchurch of Madonna delle Lagrime, and in many other places in the city\r\nand its environs. It would have been fortunate had he possessed more\r\ngenius, but this gift of nature, which, to use the words of a poet,[83]\r\nconfers immortality on books, and I would add pictures, was not granted\r\nto Soggi. Vasari has given this character of a diligent, but meagre, and\r\nfrigid painter, also to Gerino da Pistoia, in which place one of his\r\npictures, now in the royal gallery, was painted for the monks of S. Pier\r\nMaggiore; several others are in the city of S. Sepulcro, and some even\r\nin Rome, where he assisted Pinturicchio. With the two preceding, I class\r\nMontevarchi, a painter so named from his own country, beyond which he is\r\nalmost unknown. Among these artists, though they were scholars of\r\nPietro, we find imitators of the Florentines of the fourteenth century.\r\nI omit the name of Bastiano da S. Gallo, who continued with him only a\r\nshort time, and left him on account of the aversion he had conceived to\r\nthe dryness of his style. In the Florentine history, by Varchi (book\r\n10), we find mention of a Vittorio di Buonaccorso Ghiberti, who on\r\noccasion of the siege of Florence by the family of the Medici, in 1529,\r\npainted the figure of the Pontiff, Clement VII. on the facade of the\r\nprincipal chamber of the Medici, in the last act of hanging from the\r\ngallows. But neither of this, nor of any other production from so\r\ninfamous a hand, do there remain any traces in Florence, at least that I\r\nhave been able to discover, from which to judge either of the manner or\r\nthe master of Vittorio.\r\n\r\nI close the catalogue of old Tuscan painters with an illustrious native\r\nof Lucca, named the elder Zacchia, who was educated at Florence, though\r\nnot invariably adhering to the taste of that ancient school, either in\r\ndesign, which was his chief excellence, or in an outline somewhat harsh\r\nand cutting, which was his greatest defect. He obtained the name of the\r\nelder, to distinguish him from another Zacchia, who, on the other hand,\r\nshewed more softness of contour, and more strength of colouring, but in\r\ndesign, and in every other respect, was held in less estimation. I know\r\nonly of one picture by the latter artist, which is in the chapel of the\r\nMagistrates; but several altar-pieces by the former, are to be seen in\r\nthe churches of Lucca, and among them an Assumption in that of S.\r\nAugustine; a picture displaying much study and elegance, and among his\r\nlast works, as I am led to believe by its bearing the date 1527. One of\r\nhis Madonnas, surrounded by saints, formerly in the parish church of S.\r\nStefano, is now in the house of Sig. March. Jacopo Sardini, which is\r\nenriched by other paintings, by a valuable collection of drawings, and\r\nstill more by the presence of its learned possessor, to whom I am\r\nindebted for many notices interspersed throughout this work.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the art in Tuscany, about the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century. Much was then attained, because nature began to be\r\nimitated, especially in the heads, to which the artists imparted a\r\nvivacity, that even at this day is surprising. On viewing the figures\r\nand portraits of those times, they actually appear to look at, and to\r\ndesire to enter into conversation with the beholder. It still remained,\r\nhowever, to give ideal beauty to the figure, fulness to design, and\r\nharmony to colouring, a true method to aerial perspective, variety to\r\ncomposition, and freedom to the pencil, which on the whole was still\r\ntimid. Every circumstance conspired to this melioration of the art in\r\nFlorence as well as in other places. The taste for magnificent edifices\r\nhad revived throughout Italy. Many of the finest churches, many public\r\nedifices, and ducal palaces, which still remain at Milan, Mantua, and\r\nVenice, in Urbino, Rimini, Pesaro, and Ferrara, were executed about this\r\nperiod; not to mention those buildings in Florence and in Rome, where\r\nmagnificence contended with elegance. It became necessary to ornament\r\nthem, and this produced that noble emulation among artists, that grand\r\nfermentation of ideas, which invariably advances the progress of art.\r\nThe study of poetry, so analogous to that of painting, had increased to\r\na degree which conferred on the whole age the epithet of _Golden_; a\r\nname which it certainly did not merit on the score of more severe\r\nstudies. The design of the artists of that period, though something dry,\r\nwas yet pure and correct, and afforded the best instruction to the\r\nsucceeding age. It is very justly observed, that scholars can more\r\neasily give a certain fulness to the meagre outline of their models,\r\nthan curtail the superfluity of a heavy contour. On this account, some\r\nprofessors of the art are inclined to believe, that it would be much\r\nmore advantageous to habituate students in the beginning, to the\r\nprecision characteristic of the fifteenth century, than to the\r\nexuberance introduced in after-times. Such circumstances produced the\r\nhappiest era that distinguishes the annals of painting. The schools of\r\nItaly, owing to mutual imitation, before that period strongly resembled\r\neach other; but having then attained maturity, each began to display a\r\nmarked and peculiar character.\r\n\r\nThat of the Florentine school I shall describe in the next Epoch; but I\r\nfirst propose to treat of several other arts analogous to that of\r\npainting, and in particular of engraving upon copper, the discovery of\r\nwhich is ascribed to Florence. To this the art is indebted for an\r\naccession of new aids; the work of an artist, before confined to a\r\nsingle spot, was diffused through the world, and gratified the eyes of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: \"The number of artists of whom, by consulting old authors,\r\nI can collect nothing more than the time they lived, their name and\r\noccupation, and their death, (I speak of those who lived about the year\r\n1300,) amounts in the city of Florence alone to nearly a hundred,\r\nwithout including those who have been discovered and noticed by some of\r\nour antiquarians; and exclusive of those we find mentioned in the old\r\nbook of the Society of Painters.\" (See Baldinucci in Notizie del\r\nGioggi.) The Florentine painters of this age, whose names have been\r\nproduced by the Canon Moreni from the records of the diplomatic archive,\r\nmay be seen in part the fourth of his _Notizie Istoriche_, p. 102.\r\nOthers have been collected and communicated to me by the Abbate Vincenzo\r\nFollini, Librarian to the Magliabecchi collection, extracted from\r\nvarious MSS. of the same, besides those from the _Novelle Litterarie_ of\r\nFlorence, from the _Delizie de' Letter._ of the P. Ildefonso, C. S. and\r\nfrom the _Viaggi_ of Targioni; works which will always be found to\r\nsupply the brevity of the present history.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Vasari.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: They are believed to be anterior to the year 1300 by the\r\nhistorian of the art of Painting at Friuli; but to this I cannot agree.\r\nThe pictures bear a very great resemblance to the designs of Orcagna; or\r\nrather to the poetry of Dante, who, in the year above mentioned, feigns\r\nto have had his vision, and described it in the years immediately\r\nsucceeding. In confirmation of this opinion, it must be remarked that\r\nthe style is Florentine, and induces us to suppose that a painter of\r\nthat school must have been there. See _Lettera postuma del P. Cortinovis\r\nsopra le Antichita di Sesto_, published in the _Giornale Veneto_, (or\r\n_Memorie per servire all' Istoria Letter. e Civile_) Semestre ii. p. 1.\r\nof the year 1800. It was reprinted at Udine in 1801, in octavo, with\r\nsome excellent notes by the Cav. Antonio Bartolini, who has\r\ndistinguished himself by other productions connected with bibliography\r\nand the fine arts.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Vide Giuseppe Maria Mecatti, who has given an exact\r\ndescription of it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Vasari is by no means so bitter against the Venetian\r\nschool as it is wished to make him appear. In regard to these pictures\r\nhe declares, \"that they are universally admitted, with justice, to be\r\nthe best which were produced among many excellent masters, at different\r\ntimes, in that place.\" They are, therefore, preferred by him to the\r\nwhole of the Florentine and Siennese paintings there exhibited; and his\r\nopinion is authorized by that of P. della Valle, who frequently differs\r\nfrom him. If it could be proved from history, as it may be reasonably\r\nconjectured, that Antonio was a painter when he came from Venice, and\r\ndid not commence his art at Florence, he would merit the reputation of\r\nbeing the greatest artist of that school known to us; as well as of\r\nhaving conferred some benefit upon that of Florence, from the Venetian\r\nschool. But this point is very doubtful.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: We cannot reconcile it to dates that Paolo Uccello was one\r\nof his scholars, having been born after the death of Antonio, if,\r\nindeed, there be not some error in regard to the chronology either of\r\nthe master or of his pupil. Starnina might have been his pupil, as he is\r\nsaid to have been born in 1354; and, therefore, in 1370, he might\r\npossibly be one of his school. Yet it appears that Antonio had then\r\nrenounced the easel. In his epitaph we find written:\r\n\r\n  Annis qui fueram pictor JUVENILIBUS, artis\r\n  Me Medicae reliquo tempore coepit amor, &c.\r\n\r\n(See Vasari ed. Senese, tom. ii. p. 297.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The old painters varied the manner of their\r\nsuperscriptions, even in the following ages, according to the taste of\r\nthe Greeks. _Sebastianus Venetus pingebat a._ 1520; is written upon a\r\nSt. Agatha in the Palazzo Pitti; and this corresponds to the EPOIEI,\r\n_faciebat_; by which the Greek sculptors wished to convey, that such\r\nwork was not intended to exhibit their last effort; so that they were at\r\nliberty to improve it when they pleased. The subscription of Opus Belli\r\nis obvious, and similar ones, drawn from the ERGON, (for example,)\r\nLUSIPPOU which we see in Maffei. I recount in my fifth book as singular,\r\nthe epigraph _Sumus Rogerii manus_; it is, however, derived from the\r\nGreeks, who, for instance, sometimes wrote CHEIR. AMBROSIOU. MONACHOU,\r\nas I read in a Fabrianese church called Della Carita, where there is a\r\npicture of the General Judgment; the figures very small, and highly\r\nfinished, upon a large tablet; with, I think, more figures than are seen\r\nin the Paradise of Tintoretto. CHEIR BITORE, was written by Vittor\r\nCarpaccio, under his portrait cited in the index. I omit other forms\r\nbetter known. That adopted at Trevigi, _Hieronymus Tarvisio_, is very\r\nerudite; and it is imitated from the military _latercoli_, in which,\r\nwith the same view, the soldier and his country are named. In short,\r\nwhere the words _fecit_ or _pinxit_ are not used, the best plan was that\r\nof giving the proper name in the genitive case at the foot of the\r\npicture, as the engravers of Greek gems were wont to do in inscriptions,\r\nas AULOU DIOSKORIDOU, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Pascoli, tom. i. p. 199.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Vasari.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Verona Illustrata, tom. iii. p. 277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Gloria is a name given in Italy to a representation of the\r\ncelestial regions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Vasari.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: In the dictionary of Guarienti, in the article, Gio.\r\nAbeyk, appears an account of a picture of this artist, existing in the\r\ngallery at Dresden, bearing date 1416; a time, says the writer, when he\r\nenjoyed his highest reputation, by painting in his second manner, in\r\noil. It represents the Virgin in a majestic seat with the divine infant,\r\nwho is seen very gracefully receiving an apple from St. Anne, seated on\r\na couch of straw. The young St. John is seen assisting, and also St.\r\nJoseph, whose countenance represents the portrait of the painter\r\nhimself. The introduction of arms shews that the picture must have been\r\nexecuted for some distinguished person. It is in high preservation, and\r\nis pronounced by Guarienti the miracle of painting, from its display of\r\nextreme diligence, even in the minute furniture, and particularly\r\nbecause the chamber in which the scene is represented, the couch, the\r\nwindow, the pavement, executed _a punto alto_, together with the whole\r\naction, are conducted with the most exact rules of perspective.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: In 1454 he was in great credit at Perugia.

The age in which I write\r\nis, we know, by many called the age of brass, inasmuch as it has been\r\nless productive of great names and great pictoric works, than the\r\npreceding; yet I believe we might better denominate it such from the\r\nnumber of engravings, which have recently been carried to a high degree\r\nof excellence. The number of their connoisseurs has increased beyond\r\ncalculation; new collections every where appear, and the prices have\r\nproportionably advanced, while treatises upon the art are rapidly\r\nmultiplied. It has become a part of liberal knowledge to discern the\r\nname and hand of a master, as well as to specify the most beautiful\r\nworks of each engraver. Thus, during the decline of painting, the art of\r\nengraving on copper has risen in estimation; modern artists in some\r\npoints equal or surpass the more ancient; their reputation, their\r\nremuneration, and the quick process of their labours, attract the regard\r\nof many men of genius born to adorn the arts, who to the loss of\r\npainting, devote their attention to the graver.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this art is to be sought for in that of cutting on wood,\r\njust as in printing, the use of wooden types led to the adoption of\r\nmetal. The period of the first invention of wood engraving is unknown;\r\nthe French and the Germans tracing it to that of playing-cards, which\r\nthe former affirm were first used in France in the time of Charles V.;\r\nwhile the latter maintain they were in use much earlier in Germany, or\r\nbefore the year 1300.[84] Both these opinions were first attacked by\r\nPapillon, in his \"Treatise upon cutting in Wood,\" where he claims the\r\nmerit of the discovery for Italy, and finds the most ancient traces of\r\nthe art about the year 1285, at Ravenna. His account of it is\r\nrepublished in the preface to the fifth volume of Vasari, printed at\r\nSiena; but it is mixed up with so many assertions, to which it is\r\ndifficult to give credit, that I must decline considering it at all. The\r\nCav. Tiraboschi is a far more plausible and judicious advocate in favour\r\nof Italy.[85] On the subject of cards, he brings forward a MS. by Sandro\r\ndi Pippozzo di Sandro, entitled _Trattato del Governo della Famiglia_.\r\nIt was written in 1299, and has been cited by the authors of the Della\r\nCruscan dictionary, who quote, among other passages, the following\r\nwords: \"if you will play for money, or thus, or at cards, you shall\r\nprovide them,\" &c. We may hence infer, that playing-cards were known\r\nwith us earlier than elsewhere, so that if the invention of stamping\r\nupon wood was derived from them, we have a just title to the discovery.\r\nIn all probability, however, it does not date its origin so early; the\r\noldest playing-cards were doubtless the work of the pen, and coloured by\r\nthe old illuminators, first practised in France, and not wholly extinct\r\nin Italy at the time of Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan.[86]\r\n\r\nThe first indication we meet with of printed play-cards, is in a public\r\ndecree issued at Venice in 1441; where it says that \"the art and trade\r\nof cards and printed figures, that is carried on at Venice,\" was on the\r\ndecline, \"owing to the great increase of playing-cards with coloured\r\nfigures stamped,\" which were introduced from abroad; and that such\r\nimportation should be prohibited for the future. Sig. Zanetti, to whom\r\nwe are indebted for this information,[87] is of opinion, that they were\r\nin use long before 1441; because the art is seen to have first\r\nflourished there, afterwards to have fallen into disuse, and again\r\nrevived, owing to the protection afforded it by the State. These\r\nvicissitudes, that suppose the lapse of many years, will carry us back\r\nat least to the commencement of the fifteenth century. To this period,\r\nit appears, we ought to refer those ancient specimens of play-cards,\r\nwhich were collected for the cabinet of Count Giacomo Durazzo, formerly\r\nimperial ambassador at Venice, and are now to be seen in that of the\r\nMarquis Girolamo, his nephew. They are of larger dimensions than those\r\nnow in use, and are of a very strong texture, not unlike that of the\r\npaper made of cotton, found in the ancient manuscripts. The figures are\r\nexhibited on a gold ground in the manner before described;[88] there are\r\nthree kings, two queens, and two knaves, one on horseback; and each has\r\na club, or sword, or money. I could perceive no trace of suits, either\r\nbecause they had not then come into use, or more probably because so\r\nlimited a number of cards can convey no complete idea of the whole game.\r\nThe design approaches very nearly to that of Jacobello del Fiore; to the\r\nbest judges the workmanship appears the effect of printing, the colours\r\nbeing given by perforations in the die. I know of no other more ancient\r\nspecimen of its kind.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile printing of books being introduced into Italy, it was\r\nquickly followed by the practice of ornamenting them with figures in\r\nwood. The Germans had afforded examples of cutting sacred images in this\r\nmaterial,[89] and the same was done in regard to some of the initial\r\nletters during the early progress of typography, a discovery which was\r\nextended at Rome, in a book published in 1467, and at Verona in another,\r\nwith the date of 1472. The former contains the Meditations of Card.\r\nTurrecremata, with figures also cut in wood, and afterwards coloured:\r\nthe latter bears the title of _Roberti Valturii opus de re militari_,\r\nand it is adorned with a number of figures, or drawings of machines,\r\nfortifications, and assaults; a very rare work, in the possession of\r\nCount Giuseppe Remondini, along with many other specimens of the\r\nearliest period, collected for his private library, where I saw it. It\r\nis worth remarking, that the book of Turrecremata was printed by\r\nUlderico Han, that of Valturio by Gio. da Verona, and that in this last\r\nthe wood-cuts are ascribed to Matteo Pasti, the friend of Valturio, and\r\na good painter for those times.[90] After this first progress the art of\r\nwood engraving continued gradually to advance, and was cultivated by\r\nmany distinguished men, such as Albert Durer in Germany; in Italy by\r\nMecherino di Siena, by Domenico delle Greche, by Domenico Campagnola,\r\nand by others down to Ugo da Carpi, who marks a new epoch in this art,\r\nby an invention, of which we shall speak in the school of Modena.\r\n\r\nIf it be the progress of the human mind to advance from the more easy to\r\nmore difficult discoveries, we may venture to suppose that the art of\r\nengraving on wood led to that of engraving on copper; and so, to a\r\ncertain extent, it probably did. Vasari, however, who wrote the history\r\nof Tuscan professors, rather than of painting itself, refers its origin\r\nto works in _niello_, or inlaid modelling work, a very ancient art, much\r\nin use, more especially at Florence, during the fifteenth century;\r\nthough it was quite neglected in the following, in spite of the efforts\r\nof Cellini to support it. It was applied to household furniture, silver\r\nornaments, and sacred vessels, such as holy cups and vases, to missals\r\nand other devotional books, and to reliquaries; as well as to profane\r\npurposes, as adorning the hilts of swords, table utensils, and many\r\nkinds of female ornaments. In some kinds of ebony desks and escrutoires\r\nit was held in great request, for its little silver statues, and\r\nmodelled plates, representing figures, histories, and flowers. In the\r\ncathedral of Pistoia there still remains a large silver palliotto,\r\nadorned in places with plates, on which are figured images in niello,\r\nand little scripture histories. The method was to cut with the chisel\r\nupon the silver whatever history, portrait, or flowers, was\r\nrequired,[91] and afterwards to fill up the hollow part of the engraving\r\nwith a mixture of silver and lead, which, from its dark colour, was\r\ncalled, by the ancients, _nigellum_, which our countrymen curtailed into\r\nniello; a substance which, being incorporated with the silver, produced\r\nthe effect of shadow, contrasted with its clearness, and gave to the\r\nentire work the appearance of a chiaroscuro in silver. There were many\r\nexcellent _niellatori_, or inlayers, who cast models with this\r\nsubstance, such as Forzore, brother to Parri Spinelli of Arezzo,\r\nCaradosso and Arcioni of Milan;[92] and three Florentines, who rivalled\r\neach other at S. Giovanni, Matteo Dei, Antonio del Pollaiuolo, and Maso\r\nFiniguerra; specimens of whose _paci_, cut with wonderful accuracy,\r\nacquired for them the highest reputation.\r\n\r\nWe are to attribute to Maso, says Vasari, \"the beginning of engraving\r\nupon copper,\" an art, which for the sake of greater perspicuity, I shall\r\ndistinguish into three different states; the first of which will be\r\nfound as follows. Finiguerra was in the habit of never filling the\r\nlittle hollows or cuts prepared in the silver plate until he had first\r\nmade proof of his work. \"For this purpose, as in taking a cast, he\r\nimpressed them with earth, upon the top of which having thrown a\r\nquantity of liquid sulphur, they became imprinted, and filled with\r\nsmoke; which, with the aid of oil, gave him the effect of the work in\r\nsilver. He also produced the same with moistened paper, and with the\r\nsame tint or ink, pressing it sufficiently hard with a round roller,\r\nwith a smooth surface throughout. This gave them not only the effect of\r\nbeing printed, but that of having been designed with ink.\"[93] So far we\r\nquote Vasari in the preface to his Life of Marc Antonio. He adds, that\r\nin this plan Finiguerra was followed by Baldini, a Florentine goldsmith;\r\nnext to whom he mentions Botticelli; and he might have added the name of\r\nPollaiuolo. Finally, he concludes that the invention was communicated\r\nfrom Florence to Mantegna at Rome, and to Martino, called De Clef, in\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\nThese proofs, the first of their kind, made by Finiguerra, have, for the\r\nmost part, perished. Some, which are attributed to him, in possession of\r\nthe fathers of Camaldoli, are not ascertained to be his.[94] We are\r\nassured, however, that the sulphur of the pace[95] cut for S. Giovanni\r\nin 1452, upon which he represented the Assumption of our Lady, in a\r\nvariety of minute figures, is from his hand. It was formerly in the\r\nmuseum of the Proposto Gori, who gave a description of it in his Dittici\r\n(a treatise upon a peculiar kind of altar-pieces, tom. iii. p. 315), and\r\nit is now in the Durazzo cabinet, with a memorandum in Gori's own hand,\r\nin which he declares that he had compared it with the original.[96] Of\r\nthe proofs made on paper none are ascertained to exist, with the\r\nexception of that of the Assumption recognized by the Ab. Zani, in the\r\nnational collection at Paris. It was made known by him in the year 1803;\r\nand to this I may add the Epiphany, in an inferior style, but more\r\nexactly finished, which I found in the possession of the Senator\r\nMartelli, besides a duplicate belonging to S. E. Seratti. It appears\r\nfrom its style, the work of Finiguerra, and to have been executed before\r\nthe Assumption. It is doubtful whether specimens exist in the ducal\r\ngallery, a question which I leave to the solution of abler pens than\r\nmine. We have in the Durazzo collection, the proofs or models of many\r\nsilversmiths, whose names are unknown; and for many more we are indebted\r\nto Sig. Antonio Armanno, an excellent connoisseur in prints, to whom I\r\nshall have occasion to recur more than once. Following the ideas thrown\r\nout by Vasari in the passage cited, he concluded that these impressions\r\nmight happen to have been confounded _with pen designs_, owing to the\r\nresemblance between them; he therefore sought for them in collections of\r\ndesigns, and, having recognized them, purchased them for Count Giacomo,\r\nhis patron.\r\n\r\nMany of these were met with in the ancient Gadi gallery at Florence; the\r\nwork of artificers much inferior to Finiguerra, at least if we except\r\ntwo specimens not unworthy even of his hand. To these a number of others\r\nwere afterwards added from different schools of Italy. Sometimes we may\r\ngather their origin from the design; sometimes with more certainty from\r\ninscriptions, and other unequivocal signs of the period. For instance,\r\nwe read the following words in a Presepio,[97] engraved in reversed\r\ncharacters: \"Dominus Philippus Stancharius fieri fecit;\" where the\r\nfamily which is named, along with other circumstances, shew it to have\r\nbeen executed at Bologna. One small print represents a woman turning\r\ntowards a cat; and on it is written, also in reverse, \"_Va in la\r\nCaneva_;\" in another we read _Mantengave Dio_; both which are either\r\nLombard or Venetian, if we may judge from the dialect. From all this we\r\nhave a right to conclude that Vasari's words, which ascribe to\r\nFiniguerra the practice of proving his works before he inserted the\r\nniello, are not to be limited to him only, or to his school. On the\r\ncontrary, it appears that Caradosso, as well as all the best Italian\r\nartificers, considered it as no small portion of their art, and that\r\nthey only attained correctness in the process of inlaying and modelling\r\nby dint of such proofs, and not by mere chance. Nor does Vasari's\r\nsilence militate against this. He repeatedly complains, in different\r\nparts of his work, that he could not obtain sufficiently full and\r\nsatisfactory information regarding the Venetian and Lombard schools; and\r\nif he confesses his ignorance of so many things pertaining to their\r\nschools of painting, it is not surprising that he should know less of\r\ntheir engraving.\r\n\r\nThe proofs, therefore, of the _niellatori_ on paper are to be found in\r\nall parts of Italy, and they may be particularly known from the position\r\nof the letters, which being written on the original models in the\r\nordinary way, appear in the impression like the eastern characters, from\r\nright to left; and in like manner the other part of the impression is\r\nseen in reverse; as for instance, a saint is seen standing on the left\r\nhand, who, from his dignity, ought to have occupied the right, and the\r\nactors all write, play music, and do every thing with the left hand.\r\nThere are other signs which serve to distinguish them; because, having\r\nbeen pressed by hand, or with a roller, they leave no mark or furrows in\r\nthe outlines; nor are we to look for that delicacy and precision in the\r\nlines that appear in impressions from under the press. They are moreover\r\ncharacterized by their colour, which merely consisted of lamp black and\r\nof oil, or of some other very slight tint; though both this and the\r\npreceding are dubious signs, as we shall shew. It is conjectured that\r\nproofs of a similar[98] nature were made by silver carvers, in regard to\r\ntheir graphic labours, and to others in which the _niello_ was not\r\nemployed. At all events they preserved them in their studies, and in\r\nthose of their pupils, to whom they afforded a model; and in this way\r\nseveral have been handed down to our own times.\r\n\r\nFrom these early efforts, the art gradually advanced, as it appears to\r\nme, until it attained what I call the second state of the impression.\r\nWhen the pleasing effect of these proofs was seen, the idea was struck\r\nout, of forming works in the same delicate and finished taste, and for\r\nthis purpose to make use of the same means as had been until then\r\nadopted for impressions in wood. We might thus observe, that in the\r\nworkshop of the goldsmith was prepared the art of chalcography, and the\r\nfirst labours were executed upon silver, upon tin, or, as Heineken\r\nobserves, upon some composition less hard than copper. We may remark,\r\nthat such was the practice of the Italians, before they cut their\r\nsubjects in copper; but whatever material the first goldsmiths might\r\nadopt, it was not difficult for them to substitute for the shadow they\r\nproduced by the _niello_, the shadow of the cut itself, and to execute\r\nthe subject on the reverse, in order to receive the impression right.\r\nFrom that time, they proceeded gradually to refine the art. Both the\r\nroller and the press which they had then in use were very imperfect,\r\nand, to improve the impression, they first enclosed the plate in a frame\r\nof wood, with four small nails to prevent its slipping; upon this they\r\nplaced the paper, and over it a small moist linen cloth, which was then\r\npressed down with force. Hence, in the first old impressions, we may\r\nplainly trace on the reverse the marks of the linen, for which felt was\r\nnext substituted, which leaves no trace behind it.[99] They next made\r\ntrial of various tints; and gave the preference to a light azure or\r\nblue, with which the chief part of the old prints are coloured.[100] The\r\nsame method was adopted in forming the fifty cards, which are commonly\r\ncalled the game of Mantegna. I saw them, for the first time, in\r\npossession of his excellency the Marchese Manfredini, major-domo to the\r\nDuke of Tuscany, whose cabinet is filled with many of the choicest\r\nprints. Another copy I found in possession of the Ab. Boni, and a third\r\nformerly belonging to the Duke of Cassano, was afterwards transferred to\r\nthe very valuable collection made by the Senator Prior Seratti. There is\r\nalso a copy of this game on a large scale, with some alterations (as,\r\nfor instance, La Fede bears a large instead of a small cross, as in the\r\noriginal), and is of a much later date. A second copy, not so very rare,\r\nwith a number of variations, is in existence; and in this the first card\r\nbears the Venetian lion as ensign, with the two letters C. and E.\r\nunited. The card of the Doge is inscribed the _Doxe_; and elsewhere we\r\nread in the same way, _Artixan_, _Famejo_, and other words in the\r\nVenetian idiom, which proves that the author of so large and fine a work\r\nmust have belonged to the city of Venice or to the state. The design\r\ndisplays much of Mantegna, and of the Paduan school; though the cut is\r\nnot ascertained to be that of Andrea, or of any other known master of\r\nthat age. A careful but timid hand is discernible, betraying traces of a\r\ncopyist of another's designs, rather than of an original invention. Time\r\nonly may possibly clear up this doubt.\r\n\r\nProceeding from cards to books, we are made acquainted with the first\r\nattempts at ornamenting them with cuts in metal. The most celebrated of\r\nthese consist of the _Monte Santo di Dio_, and the _Commedia of Dante_,\r\nboth printed at Florence, and the two editions of Ptolemy's Geography,\r\nat Rome and Bologna; to which we may add the Geography of Berlinghieri,\r\nprinted at Florence; all the three accompanied with tables. The authors\r\nof these engravings are not well known; except so far as we learn from\r\nVasari, that Botticelli was one who acquired the most reputation. He\r\nrepresented the _Inferno, and took the impression_; and the two\r\nhistories, executed by Gio. de Lamagna in his Dante, display all the\r\ndesign and composition of Sandro, so as to leave no doubt of their being\r\nhis.[101] Other prints are likewise found pasted in a few of the copies\r\nof the same edition, amounting, more or less, to the number of nineteen;\r\nand their manner is more coarse and mean,[102] as we are informed by the\r\nCav. Gaburri, who collected them for his cabinet. They must have been\r\nexecuted by some inferior hand, and with the knowledge of the printer,\r\nwho had left blank spaces in parts of the work intended to receive the\r\nengravings, not yet completed on the publication of the work. Of a\r\nsimilar cast were other anonymous engravers of that period, nor is there\r\nany name, except those of Sandro and of Pollaiuolo, truly distinguished\r\nin the art among the Florentines. In Upper Italy, besides Mantegna,\r\nBartolommeo Montagna, his pupil, from Vicenza, (to whom some add\r\nMontagna his brother,) and Marcello Figolino, their fellow citizen, were\r\nboth well known. Figolino is asserted to have been the same artist as\r\none _Robetta_, or rather one who subscribes himself so, or R. B. T. A.;\r\nyet he ought not to be separated from the Florentine school, to which\r\nVasari refers him, which the character of his design confirms. The names\r\nof Nicoletto da Modena, F. Gio. Maria da Brescia, a Carmelite monk, and\r\nof his brother Gio. Antonio, have also survived; as well as Giulio and\r\nDomenico Campagnola of Padua. There are not a few anonymous productions\r\nwhich only announce that they were executed in the Venetian or Lombard\r\nmanner. For such artificers as were in the habit of taking impressions\r\nfrom the roller, either wholly omitted names, or only affixed that of\r\nthe designer, or merely gave their own initials, which are now either\r\ndoubtful, or no longer understood. For instance, they would write M. F.,\r\nwhich Vasari interprets into _Marc-antonio Francia_, while others read\r\n_Marcello Figolino_, and a third party, _Maso Finiguerra_; this last\r\nquite erroneously, as, after the most minute researches, made by the\r\nvery able Cavaliere Gaburri, throughout Florence, there is no engraving\r\nof that artist to be found.[103] In the Durazzo collection, after twelve\r\nplates, which are supposed to be proofs of the silver engravers, printed\r\nin reverse, we find several others of the first impressions taken with\r\nthe roller, and appearing to the right; but not unlike the proofs in the\r\nmechanical part of the impression, and in regard to the uncertainty of\r\ntheir artists. For this, and other information on the subject, I am\r\nindebted to the kindness of the Ab. Boni, who having enjoyed the\r\nfamiliar acquaintance of Count Giacomo, is now engaged in preparing a\r\nfull account of his fine collection.\r\n\r\nThe last state of engraving on copper I consider to be that in which the\r\npress and the printing ink being now discovered, the art began to\r\napproach nearer perfection; and it was then it became first separated\r\nfrom the goldsmith's art, like the full grown offspring, received\r\npupils, and opened its studio apart. It is difficult to fix the precise\r\nepoch when it attained this degree of perfection in Italy. The same\r\nartificers who had employed the roller, were some of them living, to\r\navail themselves of the press, such as Nicoletto da Modena, Gio. Antonio\r\nda Brescia, and Mantegna himself, of whose prints there exist, as it\r\nwere, two editions; the one with the roller, exhibiting faint tints, the\r\nother in good ink, and from the press. Then the engravers first becoming\r\njealous lest others should appropriate their reputation, affixed their\r\nown names more frequently to their works; beginning with their initials,\r\nand finally attaching the full name. The Germans held out the earliest\r\nexamples, which our countrymen imitated; with one who surpassed all his\r\npredecessors, the celebrated Marc Antonio Raimondi, or del Francia. He\r\nwas a native of Bologna, and was instructed in the art of working in\r\nniello by Francesco Francia, in which he acquired singular skill.\r\nProceeding next to engravings upon metal, he began with engraving some\r\nof the productions of his master. At first he imitated Mantegna, then\r\nAlbert Durer, and subsequently perfected himself in design under\r\nRaffaello d'Urbino. This last afforded him further assistance; he even\r\npermitted his own grinder of colours, Baviera, to manage the press, in\r\norder that Marc Antonio might devote himself wholly to engraving\r\nRaffaello's designs, to which we owe the number we meet with in\r\ndifferent collections. He pursued the same plan with the works of\r\nantiquity, as well as those of a few moderns, of Bonarruoti, of Giulio\r\nRomano, and of Bandinelli, besides several others, of which he was both\r\nthe designer and engraver. Sometimes he omitted every kind of mark, and\r\nevery letter; sometimes he adopted the little tablet of Mantegna, either\r\nwith letters or without. In some engravings of the Passion he\r\ncounterfeited both the hand and the mark of Albert Durer: and not\r\nunfrequently he gave the initial letters of his own and of Raffaello's\r\nname, and that of Michel Angiolo Fiorentino upon those he engraved after\r\nBonarruoti. He was assisted by his two pupils, Agostin Veneziano and\r\nMarco Ravignano, who succeeded him in the series of engravings from\r\nRaffaello; which led Vasari to observe, in his Life of Marc Antonio,\r\nthat, \"between Agostino and Marco nearly all Raffaello's designs and\r\npaintings had been engraved.\" These two executed works conjointly; till\r\nat length they parted, and each affixed to his productions the two\r\ninitial letters of his name and country.\r\n\r\nIt was thus the art of engraving in the studio of Raffaello, and by\r\nmeans of Marc Antonio, and of his school, rose to a high degree of\r\nperfection, not many years after its first commencement. Since that\r\nperiod no artist has appeared capable of treating it with more knowledge\r\nof design, and with more precision of lines and contour; though in other\r\npoints it has acquired much from the hand of Parmigianino, who engraved\r\nin aqua-fortis,[104] from Agostino Caracci, and from different\r\nforeigners of the last century, among whom we may notice Edelink,\r\nMasson, Audran, Drevet, and, in the present age, several, both Italians\r\nand strangers, of whom, in this place, we must refrain from speaking.\r\n\r\nI may be permitted, in this place, to enter into a brief investigation\r\nof the long contested question of engraving upon copper, whether its\r\ndiscovery is to be attributed to Germany or to Italy; and if to Italy,\r\nwhether to Florence or to some other place. Much has been written upon\r\nthe subject, both by natives and foreigners, but, if I mistake not, it\r\nhas scarcely been treated with that accuracy which is necessary for the\r\nattainment of truth. That it is quite requisite to divide this branch of\r\nart into three several states or stages, I trust I have already\r\nsufficiently shewn. In following up this division we shall have a better\r\nchance of ascertaining what portion of merit ought to be awarded to each\r\ncountry. Vasari, together with Cellini, in his \"Treatise upon the\r\nGoldsmith's art,\" as well as most other writers, are inclined to refer\r\nits commencement to Florence, and to the artist Finiguerra. Doubts have\r\nsince arisen; while so recent an author as Bottari, himself a\r\nFlorentine, mentions it as a circumstance not yet ascertained. The epoch\r\nof Maso was altered through mistake, by Manni, who speaks of his decease\r\nas happening previous to 1424.[105] This has been corrected by reference\r\nto the authentic books of the _Arte de' Mercanti_, in which the _pace_\r\nalready cited is mentioned as being paid for in the year 1452. About the\r\nsame time, Antonio Pollaiuolo, still a youth, as we learn from Vasari,\r\nin his life, was the rival of Finiguerra in the church of S. Giovanni;\r\nand as Maso had at that period already acquired great celebrity, we may\r\nconclude that he was of a mature age, and experienced in the art. We\r\nhave further a right to suppose, with Gaburri and Tiraboschi, that\r\nhaving then taken proofs \"of all the subjects which he had engraved on\r\nsilver,\" he had observed this custom from the year 1440, and perhaps\r\nearlier; and we thus discover the elements of chalcography in Florence,\r\nsatisfactorily deduced from history.[106] For neither with the aid of\r\nhistory, monuments, nor reasoning, am I enabled to discover an epoch\r\nequally remote belonging to any other country; as we shall shew, in the\r\nfirst place, in regard to Germany. It possesses no annals so far back as\r\nthat period. The credulity of Sandrart[107] led him to question the\r\ntruth of this, by referring to a small print of uncertain origin, on\r\nwhich he believed he could read the date 1411, and upon another that of\r\n1455. At this period, however, when the authority of Sandrart is of\r\nsmall account, no less from his frequent contradictions than his\r\npartiality, which has rendered him suspected even by his own countrymen,\r\nwe may receive his two engravings as false coin, not valuable enough to\r\npurchase the credit of the discovery from us. Those two distinguished\r\nwriters, Meerman,[108] and the Baron Heineken,[109] were equally bent\r\nupon refuting him. They do not pretend to trace any earlier engraver in\r\nGermany than Martin Schoen, called by others Bonmartino, and by Vasari,\r\nMartino di Anversa,[110] who died in 1486. Some are of opinion that he\r\nhad two brothers, who assisted him, but who are unknown; and not long\r\nafter appear the names of Israel Meckeln,[111] Van Bockold, Michael\r\nWolgemuth, master to Albert Durer, with many others who approached the\r\nsixteenth century. It is contended, however, that engraving on copper\r\nwas known in Germany anterior to these; as there exist specimens by\r\ndoubtful hands, which _have the appearance_ of being much earlier.\r\nMeerman, on the authority of Christ,[112] adduces one with the initials\r\nC. E. and the date 1465, besides two described by Bar. Heineken, dated\r\n1466, the first of which is signed _f_. 4 _s_, the second _b x s_, and\r\nboth the artists unknown. He declares that he had never seen older\r\nengravings that bore a name, (p. 231,) and observes that their manner\r\nresembles that of Schoen, only coarser, which leads him to suspect that\r\nthe authors must have been his masters, (p. 220). But whoever was\r\nSchoen's master, Heineken concludes he must have flourished more than ten\r\nyears earlier than his time, so as to bring it back to 1450, when the\r\nart of engraving by the burin was undoubtedly practised in Germany, (p.\r\n220). And as if this appeared too little to be granted, he adds, about\r\nfour pages further on, \"that he was _tempted_ to place the epoch of its\r\ndiscovery at least towards the year 1440.\"\r\n\r\nThe cause is well pleaded, but it is not carried. Let us try to confront\r\nreasons with reasons. The Italians have the testimony of history in\r\ntheir favour; the Germans have it against them. The former, without any\r\nattempt at exaggeration, proceed as far back as 1440, and even\r\nfarther;[113] the latter, by dint of conjecture, reach as far as 1450,\r\nand are only _tempted_ to anticipate it by ten years date. The Italians\r\ncommence the art with Maso, not from his master; the Germans are not\r\ncontent to date from Schoen, but from his master, an advantage they\r\neither deny to Italy, and thus fail to draw an equal comparison; or if\r\nthey concede the master, we still anticipate by ten years their origin\r\nof chalcography. The Italians, again, confirm the truth of their history\r\nby a number of authentic documents, proofs in niello, first impressions,\r\nand the progress of the art from its earliest stages to maturity. The\r\nGermans supply their historic deficiency by monuments, in part proved to\r\nbe false, in part doubtful, and which are easily convicted of\r\ninsufficiency for the proposed object. Because who can assure us that\r\nthe prints of 1465 or 66, are not the production of the brothers or the\r\ndisciples of Schoen, since Heineken himself confesses that they were\r\npossibly the work of some contemporary artists, his inferiors? Do we not\r\nfind in Italy that the followers of Botticelli are inferior to him, and\r\nappear to be of earlier date? Moreover, who can assure us that Schoen was\r\ninstructed by a master of his own nation; when all his engravings that\r\nhave been hitherto produced, appear already perfect in their kind;[114]\r\nnor do we find mentioned in Germany either proofs in niello, or first\r\nessays in metals of a softer temper? The fact therefore, most probably\r\nis, what has invariably obtained credit,--that the invention was\r\ncommunicated from Italy to Germany, and as a matter not at all difficult\r\nto the goldsmiths, was speedily practised there with success; I might\r\neven add, was greatly improved. For both the press and printer's ink\r\nbeing well known there, artists were enabled to add to the mechanic part\r\nof the art, improvements with which Italy was unacquainted; I will\r\nproduce an example of what I mean, that cannot fail to convince.\r\nPrinting of books was discovered in Germany: history and monuments alike\r\nconfirm it, which are to be traced gradually from tabular prints to\r\nmoveable types, still of wood, and from these to characters of metal. In\r\nsuch state was the invention brought to Italy, where, without passing\r\nthrough these intermediate degrees, books were printed not only in\r\nmoveable characters of metal, but with tables cut in copper, thus adding\r\nto the art a degree of perfection which it wanted. Heineken objects that\r\nthe Germans at that period had very little correspondence with the\r\ncities of Italy, with the exception of Venice, (p. 139). To this I\r\nanswer that our universities of Pisa and Bologna, besides several\r\nothers, were much frequented by young men from Germany, at that period;\r\nand that for the convenience both of strangers and of natives, a\r\nDictionary of the German language was printed at Venice, in 1475, and in\r\n1479, at Bologna; a circumstance sufficient of itself to prove that\r\nthere was no little communication between the two nations. There are,\r\nbesides, so many other reasons to believe that a great degree of\r\nintercourse subsisted, more particularly between Germany and\r\nFlorence,[115] during the period we treat of; that we ought not to be at\r\nall surprised at the arts belonging to the one being communicated to the\r\nother. Hitherto I have pleaded, as far as lay in my power, the cause of\r\nmy country; though without having been able, I fear, to bring the\r\nquestion to a close. Some time, it is possible, that those earliest\r\nessays and proofs of the art, which have hitherto eluded research, may\r\nbe discovered: it is possible that some one of their writers, who are at\r\nonce so truly learned and so numerous, may improve upon the hint thrown\r\nout by Heineken (p. 139), that the Germans and the Italians, without any\r\nkind of corresponding knowledge on the subject, struck out simultaneous\r\ndiscoveries of the modern art. However this may chance to be, it is my\r\npart to write from the information and authorities which I have before\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen whether, on the exclusion of Germany, there is any\r\nother part of Italy that may have anticipated the discovery of\r\nFiniguerra at Florence. Some of his opponents have ventured to question\r\nhis title on the strength of metallic impressions of seals, which are\r\nmet with on Italian parchments from the earliest periods. This shews\r\nonly that the art advanced during several ages on the verge of this\r\ninvention; but it does not prove that the very origin of the discovery\r\nis to be sought for in seals; otherwise we should be bound to commence\r\nthe history of modern typography from the seals of earthen-ware, with\r\nwhich our museums abound. No one will contend that certain immemorial\r\nand undigested elements that lay for many ages neglected and unformed,\r\nought to have a place in the history of art; and this we are now\r\ntreating on, ought not to date its commencement beyond the period when\r\nsilversmiths' shops had been established, where, in fact, it took its\r\norigin and grew to maturity. We must then compare the proofs remaining\r\nto us of their labours, and see whether such proofs were in use at any\r\nother place, before the time of Finiguerra. I might observe that there\r\nare two threads, as it were, which may serve as a clue to this\r\nlabyrinth, until we may somewhere or by some means ascertain the actual\r\ndate; and these two are the character and the design. The character in\r\nall the proofs I have examined, is not at all (as we commonly call it)\r\nof a gothic description; it is round and roman, according to the\r\nobservation before made (at p. 49), and does not lead us farther back\r\nthan the year 1440. The design is more suspicious: in the Durazzo\r\ncollection I have seen proofs of nielli with more coarse designs than\r\nare displayed in the works of Maso, but they are perhaps not the\r\noffspring of the Florentine school. I shall not here attempt to\r\nanticipate the judgment of those who may engage to illustrate these\r\nancient remains; nor that of the public, in regard to the engravings\r\ncorrectly taken from them, which must pronounce their definitive\r\nsentence. If I mistake not, however, true connoisseurs will be cautious\r\nhow they pass a final opinion. It will not be difficult for them to\r\ndiscern a Bolognese from a Florentine artist, in modern painting, after\r\nit is seen that each school formed its own peculiar character both in\r\ncolouring and in design; but in regard to proofs of nielli,[116] to\r\ndistinguish school from school, will not be so easy a task. For though\r\nit may be ascertained, for instance, that such a proof came from\r\nBologna; can we pronounce from the fact of its being coarser and rawer\r\nthan the designs of Finiguerra, that it is so far more ancient? Maso and\r\nthe Florentines, after the time of Masaccio, had already softened their\r\nstyle towards the year 1440; but can we assert the same of the other\r\nschools of Italy? Besides, is it certain that the silversmiths, from\r\nwhose hands proceeded the proofs, sought out the best designers;[117]\r\nand did not copy, for instance, the Bolognese, the design of a Pieta by\r\nJacopo Avanzi, or the Venetians, a Madonna by Jacobello del Fiore? The\r\nmore dry, coarse, and clumsy specimens therefore, cannot easily be\r\nadduced against Finiguerra as a proof of greater antiquity; otherwise we\r\nshould run into the whimsical sophistry of Scalza, who affirmed that the\r\nBaronci were the most ancient men in Florence, and in the whole world,\r\nbecause they were the ugliest.[118] We must therefore permit Maso to\r\nrest quietly in possession of the discovery, until further and more\r\nancient proofs are adduced, than are to be found in his cards and his\r\nzolfi.\r\n\r\nIn my account of the second state of engraving, I shall not make mention\r\nof the German masters, in regard to whom I have not dates that may be\r\nthought sufficient; I shall confine my attention to those of Italy. I\r\nshall compare the testimony of Vasari and Lomazzo; one of whom supposes\r\nthe art to have originated in Upper, the other in Lower Italy. In his\r\nLife of Marc Antonio, Vasari observes, that Finiguerra \"was followed by\r\nBaccio Baldini, a Florentine goldsmith, who being little skilled in\r\ndesign, every thing he executed was after designs and inventions of\r\nSandro Botticello. As soon as Andrea Mantegna learned this circumstance\r\nat Rome, he first began to turn his attention to the engraving of his\r\nown works.\" Now in the life of Sandro he makes particular mention of the\r\ntime when he applied himself to the art, which was at the period he had\r\ncompleted his labours in the Sistine chapel. Returning directly after to\r\nFlorence, \"he began to comment upon Dante, he drew the Inferno, and\r\nengraved it, which occupying a large portion of his time, was the\r\noccasion of much trouble and inconvenience in his future life.\"\r\nBotticelli is here considered an engraver from about 1474, at the age of\r\nthirty-seven years; and Baldini, who executed every thing from the\r\ndesigns of Sandro, also practised the art. At the same period flourished\r\nAntonio Pollaiuolo, who acquired a higher reputation than either of the\r\nlast. Few of his impressions remain, but among these is the celebrated\r\nbattle of the naked soldiers, approaching nearest in point of power to\r\nthe bold style of Michelangiolo. The epoch of these productions is to be\r\nplaced about 1480, because having acquired great celebrity by them, he\r\nwas invited to Rome towards the close of 1483, to raise the monument of\r\nSixtus IV., who died in that year.\r\n\r\nAccording to Vasari, Mantegna having decorated the chapel of Innocent\r\nVIII. at Rome, about 1490,[119] from that or the preceding year is\r\nintitled to the name of engraver, computing it from about his sixtieth\r\nyear. He flourished more than sixteen years after this period; during\r\nwhich is it to be believed that he produced that amazing number of\r\nengravings,[120] amounting to more than fifty, of which about thirty\r\nappear to be genuine specimens, on so grand a scale, so rich in figures,\r\nso finely studied and Mantegnesque in every part; that he executed these\r\nwhen he was already old, new to the art, an art fatiguing to the eye and\r\nthe chest even of young artists; that he pursued it amidst his latest\r\noccupations in Mantua, which we shall, in their place, describe, and\r\nthat he produced such grand results within sixteen or seventeen years.\r\nEither Vasari must have mistaken the dates, or wished to impose upon our\r\ncredulity by his authority. Lomazzo leads us to draw a very different\r\nconclusion, when in his Treatise (p. 682) he adds this short eulogy to\r\nthe name and merits of Mantegna, \"a skilful painter, and the first\r\nengraver of prints in Italy;\" but wherein he does not mention him as an\r\ninventor, meaning only to ascribe to him the merit of introducing the\r\nsecond state of the art at least in Italy; because he believed that it\r\nhad already arisen in Germany. Such authority as this is worth our\r\nattention. I shall have occasion in the course of my narrative to combat\r\nsome of Lomazzo's assertions; but I shall also feel bound to concur with\r\nhim frequently in the epochs illustrated by him. He was born about\r\ntwenty-five years subsequent to Vasari; he had more erudition, was a\r\nbetter critic, and on the affairs of Lombardy in particular, was enabled\r\nto correct him, and to supply his deficiencies. I am not surprised,\r\nthen, that Meerman (p. 259) should suppose Andrea to have been already\r\nan engraver before the time of Baldini and Botticelli; I could have\r\nwished only that he had better observed the order of the epochs, and not\r\npostponed the praise due to him until the pontificate of Innocent VIII.\r\nIn fact, it is not easy to ascertain the exact time when Mantegna first\r\ndirected his attention to the art of engraving. It decidedly appears\r\nthat he commenced at Padua; for the very confidence he displays in every\r\nplate, shews that he could be no novice; nor is it credible that his\r\nnoviciate began only in old age. I suspect he received the rudiments of\r\nthe art from Niccolo, a distinguished goldsmith, as he gave his\r\nportrait, together with that of Squarcione, in a history piece of S.\r\nCristoforo, at the Eremitani in Padua; each most probably being a\r\ntribute of respect to his former master. It is true that we meet with no\r\nspecimens of his hand at that, or even a later period of his early life;\r\nthough we ought to recollect that he never affixed any dates to his\r\nworks. So that it is impossible to say that none of them were the\r\nproduction of his earlier years, however equal and beautiful they appear\r\nin regard to their style; inasmuch as in his paintings we are enabled to\r\ndetect little difference between his history of S. Cristoforo, painted\r\nin the flower of youth, and his altar-piece at S. Andrea of Mantua,\r\nwhich is considered one of his last labours. A specimen of his engraving\r\nwith a date, is believed, however, by some, to be contained in a book of\r\nPietro d'Abano; intitled \"Tractatus de Venenis,\" published in Mantua,\r\n1472, \"in cujus pagina prima littera initialis aeri incisa exhibetur,\r\nquae integram columnae latitudinem occupat. Patet hinc artem\r\nchalcographicam jam anno 1472 extitisse.\" Thus far writes the learned\r\nPanzer,[121] but whether he ever saw the work that exists in folio, and\r\nof seven pages, I am not certain.[122] A quarto edition was likewise\r\nedited in Mantua, 1473, and a copy is there preserved in the public\r\nlibrary, but without any plates.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that about this period copper engraving was\r\npractised, not only in Mantua, where Mantegna resided, but also in\r\nBologna. The geography of Ptolemy, printed in Bologna by Domenico de\r\nLapis, with the apparently incorrect date of 1462, is in the possession\r\nof the Corsini at Rome, and of the Foscarini at Venice.[123] It contains\r\ntwenty-six geographical tables, engraved very coarsely, yet so greatly\r\nadmired by the printer, that he applauds this new discovery, and\r\ncompares it to the invention of printing, which not long before had\r\nappeared in Germany. We give his words as they are quoted from the Latin\r\nwithout being refuted, by Meerman, at p. 251: \"Accedit mirifica\r\nimprimendi tales tabulas ratio, cujus inventoris laus nihil illorum\r\nlaude inferior, qui primi litterarum imprimendarum artem pepererunt, in\r\nadmirationem sui studiosissimum quemque facillime convertere potest.\"\r\nThe same writer, however, along with other learned men, contends that\r\nthe date ought to be corrected, chiefly on the authority of the\r\ncatalogue of the correctors of the work, among whom we find Filippo\r\nBeroaldo, who, in 1462, was no more than nine years of age. Hence\r\nMeerman infers, that we ought to read 1482; Audifredi and others, 1491;\r\nneither of which opinions I can agree with. For the work of Ptolemy\r\nbeing published at Rome, accompanied by twenty-seven elegant charts in\r\n1478, what presumption, or rather folly, in the publisher of the\r\nBolognese edition, to think of applauding its beauty, after the\r\nappearance of one so incomparably superior! I am therefore compelled to\r\nrefer the former to an earlier period than the last mentioned year.\r\nBesides, I ought to inform the reader, that the engraving of twenty-six\r\ngeographical plates, full of lines, distances, and references, must have\r\nbeen a long and difficult task, particularly during the infancy of the\r\nart, sufficient to occupy several years; as we are certain that three or\r\nfour were devoted to the same purpose at Rome by more modern engravers,\r\nfar more expert. We are therefore bound to antedate the epoch of the\r\nBolognese engraving several years before the publication of the book,\r\nwhich belongs perhaps to the year 1472.[124] I shall not, however, set\r\nmyself up as an umpire in this dispute; anxiously expecting, as I do, an\r\nexcellent treatise from the pen of Sig. Bartolommeo Gamba; which I feel\r\nassured will not fail to gratify the public.[125] In regard to Bologna,\r\ntherefore, I shall only seek to prove that the progress of the\r\ngoldsmith's art to that of engraving upon metal, was more rapid than it\r\nhas been supposed. Heineken himself observes, in describing the Ptolemy,\r\nthat it is evident, from the traces of the zigzag, which the goldsmiths\r\nare in the habit of putting on the silver plates, the work is the\r\nproduction of one belonging to that art. The earliest works that can be\r\npointed out with certainty at Florence, are the three elegant engravings\r\nof the Monte Santo di Dio, published in 1477; and the two in the two\r\ncantos of Dante, 1481; one of which, as if a third engraving, was\r\nrepeated in the same book; while all of them seem to have been drawn\r\nfrom the roller, the art of inserting the plates in the letter-press\r\nbeing then unknown. We have yet to notice the thirty-seven geographical\r\ncharts, in whatever way executed, affixed to the book of Berlinghieri,\r\nwhich was printed about the same period, without any date. These also\r\ncontain several heads with the names _Aquilo_, _Africus_, &c., but they\r\nare all of youthful appearance, and tolerable in point of design;\r\nwhereas the same heads in Bologna are of different ages, with long\r\nbeards and caps, and in a coarser manner. The three before mentioned\r\nworks appeared from the press of Niccolo Tedesco, or Niccolo di Lorenzo\r\nde Lamagna, the first who printed books at Florence with copper plates.\r\n\r\nThe last and most complete state of engraving upon copper, comes next\r\nunder our notice. For this improvement, it appears to me, we are as much\r\nindebted to Germany as for the art of printing books. The press there\r\nfirst discovered for typography, opened the way for that applied to\r\ncopper plates. The mechanical construction to be sure was different, in\r\nthe former the impression being drawn from cast letters which rise\r\noutwards; in the latter from plates cut hollow within by the artist's\r\ngraver. A kind of ink was at the same time adopted, of a stronger and\r\nless fuliginous colour, than had been used for engravings in wood; but\r\nas it is termed by Meerman (p. 12), \"singulare ac tenuius.\" The same\r\nauthor fixes the date of this improvement in the art at about 1470; and\r\nmost probably he meant to deduce it from the earliest copper engravings\r\nwhich appeared in Germany. Of this I cannot venture to speak, not having\r\nseen the two specimens cited by Heineken, and the others that bear a\r\ndate; nor is it at all connected with our present history of Italian\r\nart, as far as regards engraving. We gather from it, that such\r\nimprovement was brought to us from Germany by the same Corrado Sweyneym,\r\nwho prepared the beautiful edition of Ptolemy at Rome. We learn from the\r\nanonymous preface prefixed, that Corrado devoted three years to the\r\ntask, and left it incomplete; and it was continued by Arnold Buckinck,\r\nand published by him, as I already observed, in 1478. The tables are\r\nengraved with a surprising degree of elegance, and are taken from the\r\npress, as Meerman, adopting the opinion of Raidelio, and of such\r\nbibliographers as have described it, has clearly shewn, (p. 258). It is\r\nconjectured that Corrado commenced his labours about 1472, a fact\r\nascertained no less from the testimony of Calderino, the corrector of\r\nthe work, than from the tables, impressions of which were taken in\r\n1475.[126] Some are of opinion that the engraving was from the hand of\r\nCorrado, although the author of the preface simply observes, \"animum ad\r\nhanc doctrinam capessendam applicuit (that is, to geography) subinde\r\nmatematicis adhibitis viris quemadmodum tabulis aeneis imprimerentur\r\nedocuit,[127] triennioque in hac cura consumpto diem obiit.\" And it\r\nseems very probable, that as he employed Italians in the correction of\r\nthe text, he was also assisted by some one of the same nation in the\r\nengravings. It strikes me, likewise, that Botticelli was attracted by\r\nthis novel art at Rome, since on his return about the year 1474, he\r\nbegan to engrave copper plates with all the ardour that Vasari has\r\ndescribed, and was in fact the first who represented full figures and\r\nhistories in the new art. Perhaps the cause of his impressions being\r\nless perfect than others, arose from his ignorance of the method of\r\nprinting upon a single page, both the plates and the characters; as well\r\nas from the want of the press, and that improved plan derived from the\r\noffice of the German printers. But from whatever cause, it is certain,\r\nthat our engravers long continued to labour under this imperfection in\r\nthe art, as I have already recounted. In the time of Marc Antonio, who\r\nrose into notice soon after the year 1500, the art, in its perfect\r\nstate, had been introduced into Italy, insomuch that he was enabled to\r\nrival Albert Durer and Luca d'Ollanda, equalling them in the mechanism\r\nof the art, and surpassing them in point of design. It is from this\r\ntriumvirate of genius that the more finished age of engraving takes its\r\ndate; and nearly at the same period we behold the most improved era in\r\nthe art of painting. The completion of the new art soon diffused good\r\nmodels of design through every school, which led the way to the new\r\nepoch. Following the steps of Durer, the imitators of nature learned to\r\ndesign more correctly; while they composed, if not with much taste, at\r\nleast with great variety and fertility, examples of which appear in the\r\nVenetian artists of the time. Others of a more studied character, formed\r\nupon the model of Raffaello and of the best Italian masters, exhibited\r\nby Marc Antonio, applied with more diligence to compose with order, and\r\nto attain elegance of design; as we shall further see in the progress of\r\nthis History of Painting, which after such necessary interruption, we\r\nprepare once more to resume.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: See Baron d'Heineken's \"Idee generale d'une Collection,\"\r\n&c. p. 239.

Paolo, and sold\r\nupon the suppression of that pious foundation. It represents the saint's\r\nconversion, with many tolerably executed figures, from an unknown hand,\r\nthough less old and valuable than that of Maso. He had ornamented it\r\nwith niello; but in order to ascertain the workmanship, it was taken to\r\npieces some years since, and the plate examined in the state it came\r\nfrom under the tools of the silversmith. The cuts were found not at all\r\ndeep, resembling those of our engravers upon sheets of copper, upon the\r\nmodel of which the silver plate, being provided with the ink, was put\r\ninto the press, and from it were taken as many, perhaps, as twenty fine\r\nproofs. One of these is in the collection of the Senator Bali Martelli;\r\nand upon this a foreign connoisseur wrote that it was the work of Doni,\r\nI know not on what authority, unless, from an error of memory, the name\r\nDoni was inserted instead of Dei.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Ambrogio Leone mentions both, _De Nobilitate rerum_, cap.\r\n41, and he particularly praises, for his skill in working niello, the\r\nsecond, who is so little known in the history of the arts. See Morelli,\r\nNotizia, p. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Vasari, who is difficult to understand, at least by many,\r\non account of his brevity, touches upon the different processes used by\r\nMaso, which are these: When he had cut the plate, he next proceeded to\r\ntake a print of it, before he inlaid it with niello, upon very fine\r\nearth; and from the cut being to the right hand, and hollow, the proof\r\nconsequently came out on the left, shewing the little earthen cast in\r\nrelief. Upon this last he threw the liquid sulphur, from which he\r\nobtained a second proof, which, of course, appeared to the right, and\r\ntook from the relief a hollow form. He then laid the ink (lamp black or\r\nprinter's ink) upon the sulphur, in such a way as to fill up the hollows\r\non the more indented cuts, intended to produce the shadow; and next, by\r\ndegrees, he scraped away from the ground (of the sulphur) what was meant\r\nto produce the light. And this is also the plan pursued in engraving on\r\ncopper. The final work was to polish it with oil, in order to give the\r\nsulphur the bright appearance of silver.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: They are to be seen in a little portable altar; and are\r\nmost probably the proofs of some niello worker of the time; who had\r\nexecuted those histories in silver to ornament some similar little\r\naltar, or the place in which sacred relics were laid. Before introducing\r\nthe niello, he had cast proofs of his work in these zolfi (sulphurs),\r\nwhich were subsequently inlaid with great symmetry and taste in the\r\naltar-piece. They consist of various forms and sizes, and are adapted to\r\nthe architecture of the little altar, and to its various parts. Many of\r\nthem have now perished, though several are yet in existence, the\r\nsmallest of which chiefly represent histories from scripture, and the\r\nlargest of them the acts of the Evangelists, to the number of fourteen,\r\nand about one-sixth of a braccio (an arm, two-thirds of a yard) in\r\nheight.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Pace, a sort of sacred vessel borne in procession by the\r\npriests; literally, it means peace.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: In this edition I ought to mention another zolfo (a\r\nsulphur cast) of the same pace of S. Giovanni, in possession of his\r\nexcellency the Senator Prior Seratti. This, when compared with the\r\nmodel, corresponds line for line; there is a full display of the very\r\ndifficult character of Maso's heads, and what is still more decisive,\r\nis, that it is cut, or indented, an effect that must have been produced\r\naccording to the manner already described. The zolfo Durazzo, as appears\r\nfrom the impression, does not correspond so well; some of the flowers\r\nand ornaments of drapery are wanting; it is not equally finished, and it\r\nseems smooth on the surface. This does not derogate from its\r\ngenuineness, for as several proofs were taken of the same _pace_, which\r\nwas cut by degrees, if we find less completeness in the Durazzo proof,\r\nit is only an indication of its having been taken before the rest. And\r\nif the impressions of the cuts are not so plainly traced as in the\r\nother, I do not, therefore, conjecture that they do not exist. The zolfi\r\nof the fathers of Camaldoli already cited, seem as if they were printed,\r\nand smooth. A fragment breaking off, highly polished on the surface, the\r\ncuts were then discovered, even to the minutest lines, as many\r\nprofessors, even the most experienced in the art of printing, to their\r\nsurprise, have witnessed; and they conjectured that the ocular illusion\r\nmight arise, 1st, from the fineness of cut made with the style, or\r\npossibly with the graver, which was diminished in proportion as it\r\npassed from the sheet to the earthen mould, and from this to the zolfo;\r\n2d, from the density of the ink, when hardened between the cuts or\r\nhollows of the zolfo; 3d, from a coat of bluish colour laid on the work,\r\nof which there remain traces, and from that which time produces both in\r\npaintings and on cards. I have not a doubt, that, if the experiment were\r\ntried on the Durazzo zolfo, the result would appear exactly the same.\r\nThe extrinsic proofs of its origin, also adduced by Gori, together with\r\nthe aspect of the monument, which is fresh in my memory, do not\r\nauthorize me to suspect the existence of a fraud.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Christ in the manger.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Heineken gives a general nomenclature of the works of\r\nthese silver carvers.

How can\r\nwe admit its accuracy, when confronted with the account of Mantegna's\r\nfellow citizen and contemporary Scardeone, who collected his works, and\r\nwho expressly declares, as cited by the Ab. Zani, \"that Mantegna\r\nengraved Roman triumphs, Bacchanalian festivals, and marine deities:\r\nalso the descent of Christ from the cross, and the burial,\" engravings\r\nexhibiting a variety of figures, and in number more than a dozen. After\r\nthis enumeration the historian adds, \"et alia permulta,\" and many\r\nothers. To confute this excellent testimony, the Ab. Zani refers only to\r\nthe words of the same Scardeone, who thus continues: \"Those plates are\r\npossessed by few, and held in the highest esteem; nine of them, however,\r\nbelong to me, all of them different.\" This writer therefore, in spite of\r\nhis expression \"et alia permulta,\" confesses that he had only nine\r\nspecimens from the hand of his fellow citizen. Yes, I reply, he\r\nconfesses his scanty portion, but admits the superior number that exists\r\nin various cabinets, and what reason have we for believing the first\r\nassertion and not the second? For my part, I give credit to the\r\nhistorian; and if any one doubt, from a diversity of style between the\r\nplates, that there is any exaggeration in his statement, I should not\r\nhence conclude that they are from different hands, but executed by the\r\nsame hand, the works of the artist's early life being inferior to his\r\nlast. For what artist ever devoted himself to a new branch, and did not\r\ncontrive to cultivate and improve it? It is sufficient that the taste be\r\nnot wholly opposite.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Panzer, Ann.

The Florentine school (I do not speak of its\r\ngreatest masters, but of the general practice of the others) had no\r\ngreat merit in colouring, from which Mengs was induced to denominate it\r\na melancholy school; nor did it excel in its drapery, from which arose\r\nthe saying, that the drapery of figures appeared to be fashioned with\r\neconomy in Florence.\r\n\r\nIt did not shine in power of relief, a study not generally cultivated\r\ntill the last century, nor did it exhibit much beauty, because, long\r\ndestitute of fine Grecian statues, Florence was late in possessing the\r\nVenus: and only through the attention of the Grand Duke Leopold, has\r\nbeen enriched by the Apollo, the group of Niobe, and other choice\r\nspecimens. From these circumstances this school aimed only at a fidelity\r\nof representation that resembles the works of those who copied exactly\r\nfrom nature, and in general made a judicious selection of its objects.\r\nIt could not boast of superior grouping in the composition of a picture,\r\nand it was more inclined to erase a superfluous figure, than to add one\r\nunnecessarily to the rest. In grace, in design, and in historic\r\naccuracy, it excels most other schools; chiefly resulting from the great\r\nlearning that always adorned this city, and invariably gave a bias to\r\nthe erudition of her artists.\r\n\r\nDesign forms the peculiar excellence of this school, and its hereditary\r\npatrimony, to which the national characteristic of minute correctness\r\nhas greatly contributed; and it may justly be observed, that this people\r\nhas excelled others no less in the symmetrical delineation of the\r\nfigure, than in purity of idiom. It may also boast of having produced a\r\ngreat many excellent painters in fresco; an art so superior to that of\r\npainting in oil, that Bonarruoti looked on the latter as mere sport,\r\nwhen compared with the former, as it necessarily requires great\r\ndexterity, and the talent of executing well and with rapidity, very\r\ndifficult attainments in any profession. This school had but few\r\nengravers on copper, from which circumstance, though abounding in\r\nhistorians,[128] and rich in paintings, it has not a sufficient number\r\nof prints to make it known in proportion to its merit; a defect which\r\nthe _Etruria Pittrice_ has in some measure supplied. Finally, the reader\r\nmay indulge in this very just reflection, that the Florentine school\r\nfirst taught the method of proceeding scientifically, and according to\r\ngeneral rules. Some other schools have originated in an attentive\r\nconsideration of natural effects; by mechanically imitating, if we may\r\nbe allowed the expression, the external appearances of objects. But\r\nVinci and Bonarruoti, the two great luminaries of this school, like true\r\nphilosophers pointed out the immutable objects and established laws of\r\nnature, thence deducing rules which their successors, both at home and\r\nabroad, have followed with great benefit to the art. The former has left\r\na Treatise on Painting, and the public were induced to look for the\r\npublication of the precepts of the latter, which have however never yet\r\nbeen produced;[129] and we obtain some idea of his maxims only from\r\nVasari, and other writers. About this time also flourished Fra\r\nBartolommeo, Andrea del Sarto, Rosso, the young Ghirlandaio, and other\r\nartists, whom we shall name in the sequel of this grand epoch, which\r\nunfortunately was of short duration. Towards the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when Michelangiolo, who survived the other great artists, was\r\nstill living, a less auspicious era began; but we must proceed with this\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nLionardo da Vinci, so called from a castle in lower Valdarno, was the\r\nnatural son of one Pietro, notary to the Florentine republic, and was\r\nborn in 1452.[130] He was endowed by nature with a genius uncommonly\r\nelevated and penetrating, eager after discovery, and diligent in the\r\npursuit; not only in what related to the three arts dependant on design,\r\nbut in mathematics, in mechanics, in hydrostatics, in music, in poetry,\r\nand also in the accomplishments of horsemanship, fencing, and dancing.\r\nHe was so perfect in all these, that when he performed any one, the\r\nbeholder was ready to imagine that it must have been his sole study. To\r\nsuch vigour of intellect he joined an elegance of features and of\r\nmanners, that graced the virtues of his mind. He was affable with\r\nstrangers, with citizens, with private individuals, and with princes,\r\namong whom he long lived on a footing of familiarity and friendship. On\r\nthis account, says Vasari, it cost him no effort always to behave and to\r\nlive like a man of high birth.\r\n\r\nVerrocchio taught him painting; and as we have said, while still a\r\nyouth, he surpassed his master. He retained traces of his early\r\neducation through his whole life. Like Verrocchio, he designed more\r\nreadily than he painted; he assiduously cultivated mathematics; in his\r\ndesign and in his countenances, he prized elegance and vivacity of\r\nexpression, more than dignity and fulness of contour; he was very\r\ncareful in drawing his horses, and in representing the skirmishes of\r\nsoldiers; and was more solicitous to improve the art than to multiply\r\nhis pictures. He was an excellent statuary, as is demonstrated by his S.\r\nTommaso in Orsanmichele at Florence, and by the horse in the church of\r\nS. John and S. Paul at Venice. Vinci not only modelled in a superior\r\nmanner the three statues cast in bronze by Rustici, for the church of S.\r\nJohn at Florence, and the colossal horse at Milan, but assisted by this\r\nart, he gave that perfect relief and roundness, in which painting was\r\nthen wanting. He likewise imparted to it symmetry, grace, and spirit;\r\nand these and his other merits gave him the title of the father of\r\nmodern painting,[131] though some of his works, as was observed by\r\nMariette, participate, in some degree, in the meanness of the old\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nHe had two styles, the one abounded in shadow, which gives admirable\r\nbrilliancy to the contrasting lights; the other was more quiet, and\r\nmanaged by means of middle tints. In each style, the grace of his\r\ndesign, the expression of the mental affections, and the delicacy of his\r\npencil, are unrivalled. Every thing is lively in his paintings, the\r\nforeground, the landscape, the adventitious ornaments of necklaces,\r\nflowers, and architecture; but this gaiety is more apparent in the\r\nheads. In these he purposely repeats the same idea, and gives them a\r\nsmile which delights the mind of a spectator. He did not, however,\r\nconsider his pictures as complete, but from a singular timidity,[132]\r\noften left them imperfect, as I shall more fully state under the\r\nMilanese school. There he will appear with the dignity of a consummate\r\nmaster, and a portion of his fame must at present suffice for his native\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe life of Lionardo may be divided into four periods, the first of\r\nwhich includes the time he remained at Florence, while still a young\r\nman. To this era may be referred, not only the Medusa of the royal\r\ngallery, and the few pieces mentioned by Vasari; but some others also,\r\nless powerful in the shadows, and less diversified in the folds of the\r\ndrapery, and which present some heads more delicate than select, and\r\napparently derived from the school of Verrocchio. Such is the Magdalen\r\nof the Pitti palace at Florence, and that of the Aldobrandini palace at\r\nRome; some Madonnas and Holy Families which are in several collections,\r\nas in the Giustiniani and Borghese galleries; and some heads of the\r\nRedeemer and of the Baptist, which are to be seen in various places;\r\nalthough it is often reasonable to suspend our judgment in regard to the\r\ngenuineness of such pieces, on account of the great number of Lionardo's\r\nimitators. The child, laid in a bed richly ornamented, enveloped in its\r\nclothes, and adorned with a necklace, which is in the house of his\r\nexcellency the Gonfaloniere of Bologna, is of a different class, and of\r\nundoubted originality.\r\n\r\nAfter this first period, Lionardo was brought to Milan by Lodovico\r\nSforza, \"whom he highly gratified by his performance on the lyre; a\r\ncurious and new instrument, almost entirely of silver,\" which Lionardo\r\ncarried with him, and had constructed with his own hands. All the\r\nmusicians there assembled were vanquished, and the whole city being\r\nstruck with admiration of his extemporaneous poetry, and his eloquence,\r\nhe was retained by the prince, and remained there till 1499, engaged in\r\nabstruse studies, and in mechanical and hydrostatical labours for the\r\nservice of the state. During this time he painted little, except the\r\ncelebrated Last Supper; but by superintending an academy of the fine\r\narts, he left a degree of refinement in Milan, which was so productive\r\nof illustrious pupils, that this period may be reckoned the most\r\nglorious era of his life.\r\n\r\nAfter the misfortunes of Lodovico Sforza, he returned to Florence, where\r\nhaving remained thirteen years, he went to Rome at the time his patron\r\nLeo X. ascended the papal chair; but his stay there was short. Some of\r\nhis best works at Florence may be referred to this period; among which\r\nnumber we may reckon the celebrated portrait of Mona Lisa, which was the\r\nlabour of four years, and yet was left unfinished; the Cartoon of S.\r\nAnna, prepared for a picture in the church of the Servi, which was never\r\nexecuted in colours; the cartoon of the battle of Niccolo Piccinino,\r\nintended to dispute the palm of excellence with Michelangiolo in the\r\ncouncil chamber at Florence,[133] but like the other, never executed by\r\nVinci, after failing in an attempt to paint it in a new method in oil on\r\nthe wall. He probably employed another method in painting the Madonna\r\nwith the child in her arms, in the monastery of S. Onofrio, of Rome, a\r\npicture in the style of Raffaello, but which is now peeling off the\r\nwalls in many places. There are some other fine pieces, which if we may\r\nbe allowed to hazard a conjecture, might be with propriety assigned to\r\nthis period, in which Lionardo, having attained his highest skill, and\r\nunoccupied by other pursuits, painted in his best manner. Such is the\r\nspecimen that was preserved at Mantua, but which was stolen, and\r\nconcealed during the sack of the city; after many vicissitudes, however,\r\nit was sold for a high price to the imperial court of Russia. The\r\nsubject is a Holy Family; in the back-ground is seen a woman of a very\r\nbeautiful and majestic countenance standing in an upright position. It\r\nbears the cipher of Lionardo, consisting of a D interlaced with an L and\r\na V, as it is seen in the picture of the Signori Sanvitali, at Parma.\r\nThe Consigliere Pagave, who left a memorandum of it in his MSS. was the\r\nfirst to observe and to recognise it, upon its being brought to Milan in\r\n1775, where it was also kept concealed. The same judicious critic in\r\npainting has conjectured that this production was executed in Rome, for\r\none of the princesses of Mantua, or rather for the sister-in-law of Leo\r\nX.; inasmuch as it displayed a decided emulation of Raphael's manner, at\r\nthat time highly extolled in Rome. Such a conjecture might receive\r\nsupport from his picture of a Madonna, which ornaments San Onofrio, also\r\nin the Raphael manner; and in order that this picture, and that of\r\nMantua just mentioned, might not be confounded by posterity with the\r\nworks of Raffaello, Lionardo, according to Signor Pagave, took care to\r\naffix the cipher of his name. Indeed, this is not at all improbable:\r\nboth writers and painters are impelled by their natural genius to adopt\r\na peculiar style; and whoever will compare the portraits that remain,\r\nexpressive of the elevated, touching, penetrating, and beautiful spirit,\r\nincessantly bent upon acquiring something still more exquisite in art,\r\nwhich inspired these two prodigies, will find little difficulty in\r\nbelieving that both produced works, which owing to a similarity of\r\nnatural taste, selection and admiration of the same object, might be\r\nmistaken for specimens of the same hand. Of this number is his own\r\nportrait, at an age which corresponds with this period, in the ducal\r\ngallery, a head that surpasses every other in that room for energy of\r\nexpression; also another head, which is in a different cabinet, and is\r\ncalled a portrait of Raffaello; together with the half-length figure of\r\na young nun so much commended by Bottari, and which he points out as one\r\nof the greatest treasures in the splendid mansion of the Marchese\r\nNiccolini. In the same rank we may include the much admired specimens in\r\nthe possession of some of the noble families at Rome; as the picture of\r\nChrist disputing in the Temple, and the supposed portrait of queen\r\nGiovanna, ornamented with fine architecture, in the Doria palace; the\r\nVanity and Modesty in the Barberini palace, the tints of which no pencil\r\nhas been able to imitate; the Madonna of the Albani Palace, that appears\r\nto be requesting the lily which the infant Jesus holds in his hand,\r\nwhile he draws back, as if unwilling to part with it; a picture of\r\nexquisite grace, and preferred by Mengs to every other painting\r\ncontained in that fine collection. It would, however, be presumptuous to\r\nassign a date to every picture of an artist who became early a\r\ndistinguished painter, and who frequently discontinued a work before it\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\nWhen this celebrated artist had attained his sixty-third year, he\r\nappears to have renounced the art for ever. Francis I. who saw his Last\r\nSupper at Milan, about the year 1515, attempted to saw it from the wall,\r\nthat it might be transported to France; and not succeeding in his\r\nproject, was desirous of possessing the artist, though now an old man.\r\nHe invited Vinci to his court, and the artist felt little regret at\r\nleaving Florence, where, since his return, he found in the young\r\nBonarruoti a rival that had already contended with him, and was even\r\nemployed in preference to Vinci both in Florence and in Rome; because\r\nthe former gave them works, if we may credit Vasari, while the latter\r\namused them with words.[134] It is known that they had a quarrel; and\r\nLionardo consulting his repose, which their emulation embittered, passed\r\nover into France, where, before he had employed his pencil, he expired\r\nin the arms of Francis I., in the year 1519.\r\n\r\nThough his style is highly worthy of imitation, it was less followed in\r\nFlorence than in Milan; nor is this surprising. Vinci left at Florence\r\nno picture in public; he there taught no pupil; and it appears that he\r\nretained Salai, whom I shall notice among the Milanese artists, in the\r\nstation of a dependant, during his residence at Florence. In Florence we\r\nmeet with pictures in the possession of private individuals, that seem\r\nthe work of Vinci; and sometimes the dealers extol them as his, gravely\r\nadding that they cost a large sum. Such pieces are probably the\r\nproductions of Salai, or of other imitators of Lionardo, who availed\r\nthemselves of his cartoons, his drawings, or his few paintings. We are\r\ninformed that Lorenzo di Credi, whose family name was Sciarpelloni, made\r\nuse of them more than any other Florentine. Educated, as well as Vinci,\r\nin the school of Verrocchio, he followed rules nearly similar; he was\r\npatient, and aimed at the same object; but he approached less closely to\r\nthe softness of the moderns. He copied, with such precision, a picture\r\nby Lionardo, which was sent to Spain, that the copy was not\r\ndistinguishable from the original. Private houses contain many of his\r\ncircular Holy Families, of which the invention and gracefulness remind\r\nus of Lionardo. I possess one which represents the Virgin sitting with\r\nChrist in her arms, and at her side the young S. John, to whom she turns\r\nas if to lay hold of him, at which the child seems timid, and draws\r\nback: it is in a lovely manner; but the style is not well suited to such\r\na subject. Some of Credi's pictures, which Bottari did not meet with in\r\npublic places, are now exhibited; as the Magdalen with S. Nicholas and\r\nS. Julian, adduced by Vasari as an example of a picturesque and highly\r\nfinished style. His Christ in the manger may be also seen at S. Chiara;\r\nand it is one of his finest pictures, for the beauty of the faces, the\r\nvigour of expression, the finish of the back-ground, and the good\r\ncolouring of the whole. Both in this, and in his other original\r\npictures, we may discern some imitation of Vinci, and of Pietro\r\nPerugino, another friend of Credi: he possesses, however, some\r\noriginality, which his scholar, Giovanni Antonio Sogliani, successfully\r\nimitated and improved.\r\n\r\nThis artist lived twenty-four years with Lorenzo; and in imitation of\r\nhis model was contented to paint less than his contemporaries, that he\r\nmight do it better. He likewise attempted to imitate Porta; but his\r\nnatural disposition led him rather to follow the simple grace of his\r\ninstructor, than the sublimity of this master. Few of this school can\r\ncompare with him for the natural appearance he gave the naked as well as\r\nthe clothed figure, or for the conception of \"handsome, good-natured,\r\nsweet, and graceful features.\"[135] Like Lionardo, he possessed the rare\r\ntalent of representing images of virtue by the faces of his saints, and\r\nof vice by those of his wicked characters. This is exemplified in his\r\nCain and Abel, in the cathedral of Pisa, where he has introduced a\r\nlandscape, that of itself would do honour to any painter. With equal\r\nfelicity in the figure and the back-ground, he painted the crucifixion\r\nof S. Arcadius, which was brought from another church to that of S.\r\nLorenzo at Florence, where it still remains. He entered into competition\r\nwith Perino del Vaga, with Mecherino, and Andrea del Sarto, at Pisa,\r\nwhere he was noted for his dilatoriness, but admired for that happy\r\nsimplicity and elegance which he always preserved. Some have praised a\r\nfew of his pictures as inclining to the manner of Raffaello, a\r\ncommendation also bestowed on Luini, and other followers of Lionardo. He\r\nhad pupils who afterwards followed other masters: but a Zanobi di\r\nPoggino, who painted many pictures for Florence, which are now unknown,\r\nappears to have had no other master.\r\n\r\nOne of the best imitators of Vinci, almost equal to Luini himself, may\r\nbe recognized in the sacristy of S. Stephen, at Bologna, in which there\r\nis a S. John in the Desert, with the inscription _Jul. Flor._ If this be\r\nread _Julius Florentinus_, the artist is unknown; but perhaps we should\r\nread _Julianus_, and ascribe it to Bugiardini. We are informed by Vasari\r\nthat he was at Bologna, and that he painted a Madonna between two\r\nSaints, for the church of S. Francis; where it still is, and approaches\r\nthe style of Lionardo fully as much as any other manner. Both pictures,\r\non comparing the style, seem the work of the same artist; and to this\r\nartist also belongs a Nativity, in the cloister of the canons of S.\r\nSalvatore; and various pictures that may be found in some private houses\r\nwith a similar epigraph. If we embrace the opinion of Vasari, we must\r\nconsider Giuliano as a feeble painter, but uncommonly careful, and\r\nconsequently slow. We should rather suppose him the imitator of any\r\nother artist than of Vinci; for he is described as the fellow student of\r\nBonarruoti, the assistant of Albertinelli, and the colourist of some\r\nworks of Fra Bartolommeo. One can readily perceive that Vasari was\r\nwrong, as in many other instances, in his slight estimation of this\r\nartist, on which account he has not paid a due attention to his works or\r\nto his style. He has represented this man as amiable in disposition, as\r\na picture of contented poverty, as also an unbounded admirer of his\r\nMadonnas, and very profuse in his own commendations; qualities which\r\nrendered him highly amusing even to Michelangiolo. Intent on amusing his\r\nreader with the character of the man, he has not perhaps sufficiently\r\nrated the merits of the artist. This is proved by the little respect\r\nwith which he mentions the martyrdom of S. Catherine in S. Maria\r\nNovella, which Bottari has called \"a work worthy of admiration,\" not\r\nonly for the figures of the soldiers, which, as Giuliano found himself\r\nunequal to the performance, were outlined with charcoal by\r\nMichelangiolo, and afterwards painted by Giuliano; but for the other\r\nparts of the story. The truth seems to be, that he had not much\r\ninvention, and did not adhere to one style; but now and then borrowed a\r\nthought; as in the Nativity already noticed, where one may recognize the\r\nstyle of Fra Bartolommeo. On considering each figure separately, he\r\nappears on the whole happy in his imitations, especially in Bologna,\r\nwhere the S. John is held in the highest esteem. In Florence he painted\r\nmany Madonnas and Holy Families, which, with the aid of the Bolognese\r\npictures, may perhaps be recognized as his by their clearness, the\r\nmasculine and somewhat heavy proportions, and the mouths sometimes\r\nexpressive of melancholy; although the subject did not properly call for\r\nit. One of these is to be seen in the collection of the noble family\r\nOrlandini.\r\n\r\nMichelangiolo Bonarruoti, of whom memoirs were published by two of his\r\ndisciples while he was still living,[136] was born twenty-three years\r\nafter Lionardo da Vinci. Like him he was endowed with a ready wit, and\r\nconsummate eloquence. His bon mots rival those of the Grecian painters,\r\nwhich are recorded by Dati, and he is even esteemed the most witty and\r\nlively of his race. He possessed not the polish and elegance of Vinci,\r\nbut his genius was more vast and daring. Hence he attained the three\r\nsister arts in an eminent degree, and has left specimens in painting,\r\nsculpture, and architecture, sufficient to immortalize three different\r\nartists. Like Vinci he gave proofs of talent in his boyish years, that\r\ncompelled his master to confess his own inferiority. This master was\r\nDomenico Ghirlandaio, who sent his own brother Benedetto to paint in\r\nFrance, from jealousy of his preeminence; and, perhaps, fearing the\r\nwonderful powers of Bonarruoti, turned his attention to sculpture.\r\nLorenzo the Magnificent, desirous of encouraging the statuary art, which\r\nwas on the decline in his country, had collected in his gardens,\r\nadjacent to the monastery of S. Mark, many antique marbles; and\r\ncommitting the care of them to Bertoldo, a scholar of Donatello, he\r\nrequested of Ghirlandaio some young man to be there educated as a\r\nsculptor; and this artist sent him Michelangiolo. This transaction was\r\ndisliked by his father, Lodovico, in whose mind the art appeared\r\ndegrading to his high birth; but he had no reason to repent it. On\r\nobtaining his object, Lorenzo not only added to the fortune of Lodovico,\r\nbut retained Michelangiolo in his house, rather as a relation than a\r\ndependant, placing him at the same table with his own sons, with\r\nPoliziano, and other learned men who then graced his residence. During\r\nthe four years that he remained there he laid the foundation of all his\r\nacquirements; he especially studied poetry, and thus was enabled to\r\nrival Vinci in his Sonnets, and to relish Dante, a bard of a sublimity\r\nbeyond the reach of vulgar souls.[137] Bonarruoti studied design in the\r\nchapel of Masaccio, he copied the antiques in the garden of Lorenzo, and\r\nattended to anatomy, a science, to which he is said to have dedicated\r\ntwelve years, with great injury to his health, and which determined his\r\nstyle, his practice, and his glory.[138] To this study he owed that\r\nstyle from which he obtained the name of the Dante of the art. As this\r\npoet made choice of materials very difficult to be reduced to verse, and\r\nfrom an abstruse subject extracted the praise of sublimity and grandeur,\r\nin like manner Michelangiolo explored the untrodden path of design, and\r\nin pursuing it, displayed powers of execution at once scientific and\r\nmagnificent. In his works, man assumes that form which, according to\r\nQuintilian,[139] Zeuxis delighted to represent; nervous, muscular, and\r\nrobust: his foreshortenings, and his attitudes are most daring; his\r\nexpression full of vivacity and energy. The poet and the painter have\r\nother points of resemblance; a display of knowledge, from which Dante\r\nappears sometimes to critics, a declaimer rather than a poet,\r\nBonarruoti, an anatomist rather than a painter; a neglect of elegance,\r\nfrom which the first often, and, if we subscribe to the opinions of the\r\nCaracci and of Mengs, the second sometimes, degenerated into\r\nharshness.[140] On points like these, which depend wholly on taste, I\r\nshall not decide, but content myself with warning the reader that such\r\ncomparisons should not be pushed too far: for this poet, from his desire\r\nof surmounting difficulties in conception and versification, has\r\nsometimes so deviated from the usual path, that he cannot always be\r\nproposed as a model for imitation: but every design of Michelangiolo,\r\nevery sketch, as well as his more finished works, may be regarded as a\r\nmodel in art; if in Dante we trace marks of labour, in Michelangiolo\r\nevery thing exhibits nature and facility.[141] It was one of his\r\nobservations, that the compasses ought to lie in the eyes; a principle\r\napparently drawn from Diodorus Siculus, where he asserts that the\r\nEgyptians had the rules of measurement in their hands; the Greeks in\r\ntheir eyes.[142] Nor is such eulogy inapplicable to our artist; who,\r\nwhether he handled his pen, his chisel, or a piece of charcoal, even in\r\nsport, still displayed infallible skill in every part of his design.\r\n\r\nBonarruoti was extolled to the skies by Ariosto for his painting, as\r\nwell as for his sculpture;[143] but Condivi and others prefer his chisel\r\nto his pencil; and he undoubtedly exercised it more professedly and with\r\ngreater reputation. His Moses on the tomb of Julius II. in the church of\r\nS. Pietro in Vincoli, his Christ in the Minerva, his Piety in S. Pietro\r\nVaticano, and the statues in the church of S. Lorenzo at Florence, and\r\nin the ducal palaces, must be acknowledged to be the finest specimens of\r\nsculpture, in themselves forming schools of the revived art. I will not\r\nextol them so highly as Vasari does the colossal David, placed near the\r\nPalazzo Vecchio, when he says \"that it bore away the palm from every\r\nstatue, modern or ancient, either Grecian or Roman;\" nor shall I follow\r\nhis annotator, Bottari, in whose judgment Bonarruoti has greatly\r\nsurpassed the Greeks, who are not so successful in statues larger than\r\nthe life. I have heard competent judges remark, that we do an injury to\r\nthe Grecian masters, not only by preferring any modern to them, but even\r\nby comparing them; but my pen ought not to wander too far from the\r\ncanvass and from colouring.\r\n\r\nThe few remaining drawings of Michelangiolo demonstrate how little he\r\npainted. Conscious of his superiority in sculpture, he seems to have\r\ndreaded appearing as a second or a third-rate painter. The majority of\r\nhis compositions that have reached our time, like those of Vinci, are\r\nmere outlines; and therefore, though many cabinets are rich in his\r\ndrawings, none can boast the possession of his paintings. The cartoon of\r\nthe battle of Pisa, prepared for a competition with Vinci in the saloon\r\nof the public palace at Florence, is said to have been a wonderful\r\nproduction in this species of art. Mariette supposes, in the letter\r\nabove quoted, that the example of Vinci paved the way for this great\r\nundertaking, which he confesses surpassed the original. Michelangiolo\r\ndid not rest satisfied with representing the Florentines cased in\r\narmour, and mingling with their enemies; but choosing the moment of the\r\nattack upon their van, while bathing in the river Arno, he seized the\r\nopportunity of representing many naked figures, as they rushed to arms\r\nfrom the water; by which he was enabled to introduce a prodigious\r\nvariety of foreshortenings, attitudes the most energetic, in a word, the\r\nhighest perfection of his peculiar excellences. Cellini observes in the\r\nthirteenth chapter of his life, that when Michelangiolo \"painted the\r\nchapel of Pope Julius, he reached not half that dignity;\" and Vasari\r\nadds, that \"all the artists who studied and designed after this cartoon,\r\nbecame eminent;\" among these he reckons the best Florentine artists of\r\nthe second epoch, from the time of Frate, and to them he joined\r\nRaffaello d'Urbino. This is a point of critical disquisition not yet\r\nsufficiently cleared up, though much has been written both for and\r\nagainst the opinion of Vasari. I am not of the number of those who\r\nsuppose that the labours of Bonarruoti had no influence on the style of\r\nRaffaello, because it appears dissimilar. It would seem to me an act of\r\ninjustice to this divine genius, to imagine that profiting as he did by\r\nthe finest productions of the art, he neglected those sources of\r\ninformation. I therefore firmly believe, that Raffaello likewise studied\r\nMichelangiolo, which he himself appears to acknowledge, as I shall\r\nafterwards relate. I cannot, however, grant to Vasari that he saw this\r\ncartoon on his first short visit to Florence.[144]\r\n\r\nThis cartoon has perished, and report accuses Baccio Bandinelli of\r\ntearing it in pieces, either that others might not derive advantage from\r\nviewing it, or because from partiality to Vinci, and hatred to\r\nBonarruoti, he wished to remove a subject of comparison, that might\r\nexalt the reputation of the latter above that of Lionardo. This\r\ncircumstance is not authenticated, nor are we much interested in the\r\nsupposed criminal, who though eminent as a designer and a sculptor,\r\npainted a very few pieces, that may almost all be reduced to an Ebriety\r\nof Noah, and the Imprisonment of the Fathers of the Church. Baccio soon\r\nrenounced the pencil, and Michelangiolo appears to have done the same,\r\nfor he was called to Rome by Julius II. as a sculptor, and when the\r\nPope, about 1508, asked him to paint the ceiling of the chapel, he\r\ndeclined it, and wished to transfer the commission to Raffaello.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, constrained to undertake it, and, unaccustomed to work\r\nin fresco, he invited some of the best painters in this branch from\r\nFlorence,[145] that they might assist, or rather that they might\r\ninstruct him. When he had acquired what he deemed necessary, he effaced\r\ntheir labours entirely, and set about the work without an assistant.\r\nWhen the task was about half finished, he exhibited it for a little time\r\nto the public. He then applied himself to the other part, but proceeding\r\nmore slowly than the impatience of the pontiff could endure, he was\r\ncompelled by threats to use quicker despatch, and without assistance\r\nfinished the greater part, then incomplete, in twenty months. I have\r\nsaid that he was unaided, for such was the delicacy of his taste, that\r\nno artist could please him; and as in sculpture, every piercer, file,\r\nand chisel, which he used, was the work of his own hands, so in\r\npainting, \"he prepared his own colours, and did not commit the mixing\r\nand other necessary manipulations to mechanics or to boys.\"[146] Here\r\nmay be seen those grand and finely varied figures of the Prophets and\r\nthe Sybils, the style of which is pronounced by Lomazzo, an impartial\r\njudge, because an artist of a different school, \"to be the finest in the\r\nworld.\"[147] There, indeed, the dignity of the aspects, the solemn\r\nmajesty of the eyes, a certain wild and uncommon casting of the drapery,\r\nand the attitudes, whether representing rest or motion, announce an\r\norder of beings who hold converse with the Deity, and whose mouths utter\r\nwhat he inspires. Amid this display of genius, the figure most admired\r\nby Vasari is that of Isaiah, \"who, absorbed in meditation, places his\r\nright hand in a book, to denote where he had been reading; and with his\r\nleft elbow on the book, and his cheek resting on that hand, he turns\r\nround his head, without moving the rest of his body, on being called by\r\none of the children that are behind him; a figure which, if attentively\r\nstudied, might fully teach the precepts of a master.\" No less science is\r\ndisplayed in his pictures of the Creation of the World, of the Deluge,\r\nof Judith, and in the other compartments of that vast ceiling. All is\r\nvaried and fanciful in the garments, the foreshortenings, and the\r\nattitudes: all is novel in the composition and the designs. He that\r\ncontemplates the pictures of Sandro and his associates on the walls, and\r\nthen, raising his eyes to the ceiling, beholds Michelangiolo \"soaring\r\nlike an eagle above them all,\" can hardly believe that a man, not\r\nexercised in painting, in what may be considered as his first essay,\r\nshould so nearly approach the greatest masters of antiquity, and thus\r\nopen a new career to modern artists.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding pontificates, Michelangiolo, always occupied in\r\nsculpture and architecture, almost wholly abandoned painting, till he\r\nwas induced by Paul III. to resume the pencil. Clement VII. had\r\nconceived the design of employing him in the Sistine Chapel on two other\r\ngrand historical pictures; the Fall of the Angels, over the gate, and\r\nthe Last Judgment, in the opposite facade, over the altar. Michelangiolo\r\nhad composed designs for the Last Judgment, and Paul III. being aware of\r\nthis, commanded, or rather entreated him, to commence the work; for he\r\nwent to the house of Michelangiolo, accompanied by ten Cardinals, an\r\nhonour, except in this instance, unknown in the annals of the art. On\r\nthe suggestion of F. Sebastiano del Piombo, he was desirous that the\r\npicture should be painted in oil; but this he could not procure, for\r\nMichelangiolo replied, that he would not undertake it except in fresco,\r\nand that oil painting was employment only fit for women, or idlers of\r\nmean capacity. He caused the plaister prepared by Frate to be thrown\r\ndown, and substituting a rough-cast suited to his purpose, he completed\r\nthe work in eight years, and exhibited it in 1541. If in the ceiling of\r\nthe chapel he could not fully satisfy himself, and was unable to retouch\r\nit as he wished to do after it was dry, in this immense painting he had\r\nan opportunity of fulfilling his intentions, and of demonstrating to the\r\nfull the powers of his genius. He peopled this space, and disposed\r\ninnumerable figures awakened by the sound of the last trumpet; bands of\r\nangels and of devils, of elected and condemned souls: some of them\r\nrising from the tomb, others standing on the earth; some flying to the\r\nregions of bliss, while others are dragged down to punishment.\r\n\r\nBottari observes[148] that there have been some who affected to\r\ndepreciate this picture, on comparing it with the works of other\r\nartists, by remarking how much he might have added to the expression, to\r\nthe colouring, or to the beauty of the contours: but Lomazzo,\r\nFelibien,[149] and several others, have not failed on that account to\r\nacknowledge him supreme in that peculiar branch of the profession, at\r\nwhich he aimed in all his works, and especially in this of his Last\r\nJudgment. The subject itself appeared rather created than selected by\r\nhim. To a genius so comprehensive, and so skilled in drawing the human\r\nfigure, no subject could be better adapted than the Resurrection; to an\r\nartist who delighted in the awful, no story more suitable than the day\r\nof supernal terrors. He saw Raffaello pre-eminent in every other\r\ndepartment of the art: he foresaw that in this alone could he expect to\r\nbe triumphant; and, perhaps, he indulged the hope also that posterity\r\nwould adjudge the palm to him who excelled all others in the most\r\narduous walk of art. Vasari, his confidant, and the participator of his\r\nthoughts, seems to hint at something of this sort in two passages in his\r\nLife of Michelangiolo.[150] He informs us, \"that applying himself to the\r\nhuman figure, the great object of art, he neglected the attractions of\r\ncolouring, all sporting of the pencil, and fantastic novelty:\" and\r\nagain, \"neither landscapes, trees, nor houses, are to be seen in it, and\r\nwe even look in vain for some degree of variety and ornament, which are\r\nnever attempted, probably because he disdained to submit his towering\r\ngenius to such objects.\" I cannot suppose in Michelangiolo such\r\narrogance, nor such negligence of his own improvement in an art which\r\nembraces every object in nature, that he would limit himself to the\r\nnaked figure, which is a single branch, and to one only character, his\r\nown sublime and awful manner. I rather imagine, that discovering his\r\nstrength in this style, he did not attempt any other. There he proceeded\r\nas in his peculiar province, and, what one cannot wholly commend, he\r\nobserved no limits, and wished for no control. This Last Judgment was\r\nfilled with such a profusion of nudity, that it was in great danger of\r\nbeing destroyed: from a regard to the decency of the sanctuary, Paul IV.\r\nproposed to white-wash it, and was hardly appeased with the correction\r\nof its most glaring indelicacies, by some drapery introduced here and\r\nthere by Daniel da Volterra, on whom the facetious Romans, from this\r\ncircumstance, conferred the nick-name of the _Breeches-maker_.[151]\r\n\r\nOther corrections have been proposed in it by different critics, both\r\nwith regard to the costume and the conception. The artist has been\r\ncensured for confounding sacred with profane history; for introducing\r\nthe angels of Revelation with the Stygian ferryman; Christ sitting in\r\njudgment, and Minos, who assigns his proper station to each of the\r\ndamned. To this profanity he added satire, by pourtraying in Minos the\r\nfeatures of a master of the ceremonies, who, in the hearing of the Pope,\r\nhad pronounced this picture more suitable for a bagnio than a\r\nchurch;[152] but Bonarruoti did not set the example in such composition.\r\nScannelli has expressed a wish that there had been greater variety in\r\nthe proportion, and muscularity according to the diversity of age;[153]\r\nalthough, by an evident anachronism, this criticism is attributed to\r\nVinci, who died in 1519. Albani, as quoted by Malvasia,[154] says, that\r\n\"had Michelangiolo contemplated Raffaello, he might have learned to\r\ndispose the crowd that surround the judgment-seat of Christ in a\r\nsuperior manner;\" but here I am uncertain whether he blames the\r\ncomposition or the perspective.[155] I can discover, however, an\r\nanachronism in his imagining the Last Judgment an earlier work than it\r\nreally is by many years; as if it had been executed before Raffaello\r\ncame to Rome.\r\n\r\nI find that Albani rendered justice to the merit of Michelangiolo; he\r\nreckoned not three great masters in painting only, as is now commonly\r\ndone; but he added a fourth, and thought that Bonarruoti surpassed\r\nRaffaello, Tiziano, and Coreggio, \"in form and in grandeur.\"[156] We may\r\nhere observe, that when Michelangiolo was so inclined, he could obtain\r\ndistinction for those endowments in which the others excelled. It is a\r\nvulgar error to suppose that he had no idea of grace and beauty; the Eve\r\nof the Sistine Chapel turns to thank her maker, on her creation, with an\r\nattitude so fine and lovely, that it would do honour to the school of\r\nRaffaello. Annibale Caracci admired this, and many other naked figures\r\nin this grand ceiling, so highly, that he proposed them to himself as\r\nmodels in the art, and according to Bellori,[157] preferred them to\r\nthose of the Last Judgment, that appeared to him too anatomical. In\r\nchiaroscuro Michelangiolo had not the skill and delicacy of Coreggio;\r\nbut the paintings of the Vatican have a force and relief much commended\r\nby Renfesthein, an eminent connoisseur, who, on passing from the Sistine\r\nChapel to the Farnesian gallery, remarked how greatly in this respect\r\nthe Caracci themselves were eclipsed by Bonarruoti. Dolce speaks less\r\nfavourably of his colouring,[158] for this author was captivated by\r\nTiziano and the Venetian school: no one, however, can deny that the\r\ncolouring of Michelangiolo in this chapel is admirably adapted to the\r\ndesign,[159] and the same, also, would have been the case with his two\r\npictures in the Pauline Chapel, the Crucifixion of S. Peter and the\r\nConversion of S. Paul, but they have sustained great injury from time.\r\n\r\nNone of his paintings are to be seen in public, except in those two\r\nchapels; and those described as his in collections, are almost all the\r\nworks of other hands. During his residence at Florence he painted an\r\nexquisite Leda for Alphonso, Duke of Ferrara, to whom however it was not\r\nsold. Michelangiolo, offended at the manner in which it was demanded by\r\none of the courtiers of that prince, refused to let him have it: but\r\nmade a present of it to his pupil, Antonio Mini, who carried it to\r\nFrance. Vasari describes it as \"a grand picture, painted in distemper,\r\nthat seemed as if breathed on the canvass;\" and Mariette affirms, in his\r\nnotes on Condivi, that he saw the picture in a damaged state, and that\r\nit appeared as if Michelangiolo had there forgot his usual style, and\r\n\"approached the tone of Tiziano.\" This expression inclines one to\r\nsuspect that he is describing a copy taken in oil by some able painter;\r\nespecially as D'Argenville informs us that this painting was burnt in\r\nthe reign of Louis XIII. It is said there is also one of his pictures,\r\nrepresenting the Virgin and the Divine Infant, in an upright position,\r\nstanding near the cradle upon a rock, a figure drawn of the size of\r\nnature, formerly in possession of the noble house of Mocci (Mozzi) at\r\nFlorence; and afterwards transferred to the cathedral of Burgos, where\r\nit still remains.[160] Michelangiolo executed likewise a circular Holy\r\nFamily, with some naked figures in the distance, for Agnol Doni. It is\r\nnow in the tribune of the Florentine gallery, in a high state of\r\npreservation. It is praised by Richardson and some others for the vigour\r\nof its tints, and is painted in distemper. Placed among the works of the\r\ngreatest masters of every school that vie with each other in this\r\ntheatre of art, it appears the most scientific, but the least pleasing\r\npicture: its author seems the most powerful designer, but the feeblest\r\ncolourist among them all. In it aerial perspective is neglected,\r\ninasmuch as the figures are not indistinct in proportion to their\r\ndiminution, a fault not uncommon in that age. I cannot so readily decide\r\nwhether his style appears in certain pictures that are described as his\r\nin several collections in Florence, Rome, and Bologna, as well as in the\r\ncatalogue of the imperial gallery at Vienna, and in the royal\r\ncollections in Spain, that represent the subjects of the\r\nCrucifixion,[161] the Pieta,[162] the Infant Jesus asleep, and the\r\nPrayer in the Garden. They resemble the design of Michelangiolo, but\r\ntheir execution betrays another pencil. This is rendered probable by the\r\nsilence of Vasari; their high finish seems incredible in an artist, who,\r\neven in sculpture, very rarely attempted it; and our scepticism is\r\nconfirmed by the opinion of Mengs, and other competent judges, whom I\r\nhave consulted to elucidate this point. Some of them, in which the\r\ndistribution of the tints was perhaps originally made under his\r\ninspection, resemble his style. These may have been copied by\r\nFiamminghi, as the tints of some of them indicate, or by other Italian\r\nartists of the various schools, since they differ so much in their mode\r\nof colouring. Some copies may be the work of the scholars of\r\nMichelangiolo, though Vasari informs us they were all but feeble\r\nartists. He gives us the names of those who dwelt in his house; Pietro\r\nUrbano of Pistoia, a man of genius, but very indolent; Antonio Mini of\r\nFlorence, and Ascanio Condivi da Ripatransone, both eager in their\r\nprofession, but of little talent, and therefore the authors of no work\r\nworthy of record. The people of Ferrara include their countryman Filippi\r\nin this school, an artist unknown to Vasari, but worthy of notice.\r\nLomazzi mentions Marco da Pino as one of the number. To these Palomino\r\nadds Castelli of Bergamo, (whose master, while he was in Rome, is not\r\nnoticed by any of our writers) and Gaspar Bacerra, of Andalusia, a\r\ncelebrated Spanish painter. We may likewise add Alonzo Berrugese, who is\r\nreckoned by Vasari only among those that studied the cartoon of\r\nMichelangiolo, at Florence, with Francia, and other strangers, who were\r\nnot among his disciples. In the history of Spanish painting, there is\r\nmentioned by all the writers a Roman, of the name of Matteo Perez\r\nd'Alessio, or d'Alessi. They recount that he lived many years at\r\nSeville, and produced many works there, among which his S. Cristoforo,\r\nin the cathedral, which cost 4,000 crowns, is by far the grandest. They\r\nadd, that Luigi Vargas, a very able disciple of Perino del Vaga, having\r\nreturned from Rome, Alessi was glad to leave the field open to him, and\r\nto return into Italy; where Preziado finds him. Indeed he rather finds\r\nhim at Rome, and at the Sistine Chapel, where two histories, painted\r\n\"opposite to the Last Judgment of his master,\" are ascribed to him;\r\nthese however are the production of Matteo da Leccio, who aimed at\r\nimitating Michelangiolo and Salviati; but he is only despised by Taia,\r\nand by every one who has a grain of sense. He executed this work in the\r\ntime of Gregory XIII.; and neither he nor the supposititious\r\nAlessio,[163] an imaginary name, had any connexion with Michelangiolo.\r\nThe rest we refer to the note, in order to proceed without delay to\r\nnames which may boast a better title to such a connexion.\r\n\r\nMany other figures and historic compositions were designed by\r\nMichelangiolo, and painted at Rome by F. Sebastiano del Piombo, an\r\nexcellent colourist of the Venetian school. The Pieta in the church of\r\nS. Francis of Viterbo,[164] the Flagellation, and Transfiguration, with\r\nsome other pieces at S. Pietro in Montorio, are of this number. Two\r\nAnnunciations, designed by Bonarruoti, were coloured for altar-pieces by\r\nMarcello Venusti of Mantua, a scholar of Perino, who adopted the style\r\nof Michelangiolo, without apparent affectation. The one was put up in\r\nthe church of S. Giovanni Laterano, the other in the Della Pace. He is\r\nsaid to have painted also some cabinet pictures after designs of\r\nBonarruoti; as the Limbo,[165] in the Colonna palace; the Christ going\r\nto Mount Calvary, and some other pieces in the Borghese; also the\r\ncelebrated copy of the Last Judgment, which he painted for Cardinal\r\nFarnese, that still exists in Naples. Although a good designer, and the\r\nauthor of many pieces described by Baglione, he obtained greater\r\ncelebrity by clothing the inventions of Michelangiolo in exquisite\r\nbeauty, especially in small pictures, of which, Vasari says, he executed\r\na great many. This writer, and Orlandi following him, have erroneously\r\nnamed him Raffaello, not Marcello. Batista Franco coloured the Rape of\r\nGanymede, after a design of Bonarruoti, which was also done by the\r\nartist who painted the small picture which D'Argenville describes in\r\nFrance; and another on a larger scale, to be seen at Rome in the\r\npossession of the Colonna family: it was also painted in oil by Giulio\r\nClovio. Pontormo employed himself in a similar manner at Florence, on\r\nthe design of Venus and Cupid; and on the cartoon of Christ appearing to\r\nMary Magdalen, a work which was re-executed by him for Citta di\r\nCastello, Bonarruoti having said, that none could perform it better.\r\nFrancesco Salviati painted another of his designs, and Bugiardini, as we\r\nhave already noticed, executed some figures designed by him. Such is the\r\ninformation transmitted to us by Vasari; and he would have been justly\r\nreprehensible if he had written with such minuteness on the drawings of\r\nMichelangiolo, and of those employed to finish them, and had neglected\r\nto inform us as to those pieces which Michelangiolo himself executed.\r\nHence it is not easy to avoid scepticism on the genuineness of the\r\nAnnunciation, the Flagellation, or any other oil painting ascribed to\r\nBonarruoti by Bottari, D'Argenville, or the describers of collections.\r\nWe have noticed his aversion to this method of painting. We are informed\r\nthat during his lifetime he employed others in this branch; and we know\r\nthat after his death artists availed themselves of his designs; as\r\nSabbatini did in a Pieta for the sacristy of the Church of S. Peter, a\r\nwork copied by some other artist for the Madonna de' Monti, and some\r\nothers made known to us by Baglione. Can we then hesitate as to the\r\noriginality of any picture, if we give credit to the oil paintings of\r\nMichelangiolo? The portraits of Bonarruoti ascribed to his own hand, are\r\nalso, in my opinion, supposititious. Vasari knew of no likeness of him\r\nexcept the figure cast in bronze by Ricciarelli, and two portraits, the\r\none painted by Bugiardini, the other by Jacopo del Conte. From these are\r\nderived the very old and well known portraits, preserved in the ducal\r\ngallery, in the collection of the Capitol, in the Caprara palace at\r\nBologna, and that in the possession of Cardinal Zelada at Rome.\r\n\r\nFranco, Marco da Siena, Tibaldi, and other foreign artists, who have\r\nimitated Michelangiolo, shall be noticed under their respective schools.\r\nThe Florentine school abounded in them, and these we shall consider all\r\ntogether in the succeeding epoch. I shall here only notice two, who\r\nlived on intimate habits with him, who executed works under his own eye,\r\nand for a long time received directions from his own lips; circumstances\r\nwhich cannot be said of Vasari, of Salviati, nor of any other able\r\nartist of his school. One of these was Francesco Granacci of Florence,\r\ncharacterized by Vasari as an excellent artist, who derived much of his\r\nmerit from his early intimacy with Michelangiolo. He was the fellow\r\nstudent of the latter, under Domenico Ghirlandaio, and also in the\r\ngarden of Lorenzo; and from his precepts, and by studying his cartoon,\r\nhe enlarged his own manner, and approached near the modern style. After\r\nthe death of his master, he remained with the brothers of that artist,\r\nto complete some of the works of the deceased, and was employed in\r\npainting some Holy Families, and cabinet pictures, in distemper, which\r\nmight easily pass under another name, as they resemble the best\r\nproductions of that school. In his new style he never entirely abandoned\r\nthe simplicity of the old manner; but there is a specimen in the church\r\nof S. Jacopo without-the-walls, more studied in design, and more\r\ndetermined in the colouring. In this picture S. Zanobi and S. Francis\r\nappear near our Lady under a lofty canopy; a subject then familiar in\r\nevery school. His style seems more matured in an Assumption which was in\r\nS. Pier Maggiore, a church now suppressed: here he inserted, between two\r\nother figures, a S. Thomas, wholly in the manner of Michelangiolo. Few\r\nother considerable paintings can be ascribed to this artist, who was\r\nleft in easy circumstances by his father, and painted rather as a\r\ncommendable amusement than from necessity.\r\n\r\nRicciarelli, usually known in history by the name of Daniele di\r\nVolterra, enjoys a greater name, and is generally described as the most\r\nsuccessful follower of Michelangiolo. Educated in Siena, according to\r\nreport, by Peruzzi and Razzi, he became the assistant of Perino del\r\nVaga, and acquired an astonishing talent for imitating Bonarruoti, who\r\ngreatly esteemed him, appointed him his substitute in the labours of the\r\nVatican, brought him into notice, and assisted and enriched him with\r\ndesigns. It is known that Michelangiolo was often with Daniele when he\r\npainted in the Farnese palace, and it is said that Bonarruoti, during\r\nhis absence, \"O vero o falso che la fama suoni,\" mounted the scaffold,\r\nand sketched with charcoal a colossal head that is still seen there.\r\nVolterra let it remain, that posterity might judge of the powers of\r\nBonarruoti, who without pre-meditation and in mere jest, had finished a\r\nwork in such proportion, and so perfect. Nor did Daniele execute,\r\nwithout the assistance of Michelangiolo, the wonderful Descent from the\r\nCross in the Trinita de' Monti, which, together with the Transfiguration\r\nby Raffaello, and the S. Girolamo of Domenichino, may be reckoned among\r\nthe finest paintings in Rome.[166] We seem to behold the mournful\r\nspectacle, and the Redeemer sinking with the natural relaxation of a\r\ndead body in descending: the pious men engaged in various offices, and\r\nthrown in different and contrasted attitudes, appear assiduously\r\noccupied with the sacred remains which they seem to venerate; the mother\r\nof Jesus having fainted between the sorrowing women, the beloved\r\ndisciple extends his arms and bends over her. There is a truth in the\r\nnaked figures that seems perfect nature; a colouring in the faces and\r\nthe whole piece that suits the subject, and is more determined than\r\ndelicate; a relief, a harmony, and, in a word, a skill that might do\r\nhonour to the hand of Michelangiolo himself, had the picture been\r\ninscribed with his name. To this the artist, I believe, alluded, when he\r\npainted Bonarruoti with a mirror near it; as if in this picture he might\r\nbehold a reflection of himself. Volterra painted some other Crucifixions\r\nin the Orsini Chapel, where he was employed for seven years; but they\r\nare inferior to that described above. He employed his pupils in another\r\nchapel of that church, (Michele Alberti, according to the Guide to Rome,\r\nand Gio. Paolo Rossetti,) and supplied them with designs; one of which\r\nhe himself executed in a picture, with figures of a moderate size. The\r\nsubject is the Murder of the Innocents, and it is now deposited in the\r\nTribune of the Royal Gallery of Florence; an honour that speaks more for\r\nit than my eulogy. The Grand Duke Leopold purchased it at a high price\r\nfrom a church in Volterra, where there is now no other public specimen\r\nof this master. The Ricciarelli family possess a fine Elijah, as an\r\ninheritance and memorial of this great man; and a beautiful fresco\r\nremains in a study in the house of the Dottor Mazzoni, relating to which\r\nwe may refer the reader to the excellent historiographer of Volterra,\r\n(tom. i. p. 177).\r\n\r\nThere was a youth of Florence, named Baccio della Porta, because his\r\nstudy was near a gate of that city; but having become a Dominican, he\r\nobtained that of Fra Bartolommeo di S. Marco, from the convent where he\r\nresided, or, more shortly, that of Frate. Whilst he studied under\r\nRosselli, he became enamoured of the grand _chiaro-scuro_ of Vinci, and\r\nemulated him assiduously. We read that his friend Albertinelli studied\r\nmodelling, and copied ancient basso-relievos, from a desire of obtaining\r\ncorrectness in his shadows; and we may conjecture the same of Baccio,\r\nalthough Vasari is silent on this head. The Prince has a Nativity and\r\nCircumcision of Christ in his early manner; most graceful little\r\npictures, resembling miniatures. About this period he also painted his\r\nown portrait in the lay habit, a full-length figure, most skilfully\r\ninclosed in a small space, and now in the splendid collection of the\r\nSignori Montecatini at Lucca. He entered the cloister in 1500, at the\r\nage of thirty-one, and for four years never handled the pencil. The\r\nexecution of Savonarola, whom he knew and respected, preyed upon his\r\nmind; and, like Botticelli and Credi, he gave up the art. When he again\r\nresumed it, he seems to have advanced daily in improvement, during the\r\nlast thirteen or fourteen years of his life; so that his earlier\r\nproductions, though very beautiful, are inferior to his last. His\r\nimprovement was accelerated by Raffaello, who came to Florence to pursue\r\nhis studies in 1504, contracted a friendship for him, and was at the\r\nsame time his scholar in colouring, and his master in perspective.[167]\r\nHaving gone to Rome some years after, to see the works of Bonarruoti and\r\nRaffaello, if I am not deceived, he greatly elevated his style; but his\r\nmanner was at all times more conformable to that of his friend than of\r\nhis fellow citizen, uniting dignity with grace in his heads and in his\r\ngeneral design. The picture in the Pitti palace is a proof of this,\r\nwhich Pietro da Cortona imagined to be the work of Raffaello, though\r\nFrate had painted it before he went to Rome. In that place he appeared\r\nwith diminished lustre, says the historian, in the presence of those two\r\ngreat luminaries of the art, and speedily returned to Florence; a\r\ncircumstance which also happened to Andrea del Sarto, to Rosso, and to\r\nother truly eminent masters, whose modesty was equal to the confidence\r\nof innumerable artists of mediocrity, who frequently enjoyed at Rome\r\nmuch ill placed patronage. Frate left there two figures of the Chief\r\nApostles, that are preserved in the Quirinal palace; the S. Peter, which\r\nwas not finished, had its last touches from the hand of Raffaello. One\r\nof his pictures is also in the Vatican palace, where it was deposited by\r\nPius VI., with many other choice paintings. A Holy Family exists in the\r\nCorsini collection by the same hand, and is perhaps his finest and most\r\ngraceful performance.\r\n\r\nHis most finished productions are in Tuscany, which boasts various\r\naltar-pieces, and all of them very valuable. Their composition is in the\r\nusual style of the age, which may be observed in the production of every\r\nschool, not even excepting Raffaello, and which continued in the\r\nFlorentine until the time of Pontormo; viz. a Madonna seated, with an\r\ninfant Jesus, and accompanied by saints. But in this hackneyed subject,\r\nFrate distinguished himself by grand architecture, by magnificent\r\nflights of steps, and by the skilful grouping of his saints and\r\ncherubims. He introduces them, one while seated in concert, another time\r\npoised on their wings to minister to their king and queen; of whom some\r\nsupport the drapery, others have charge of the pavilion, a rich and\r\nhappily conceived ornament, which he readily connected with such\r\nthrones, even in cabinet pictures. He departed from this mode of\r\ncomposition in a picture that he left at S. Romano of Lucca, called\r\nMadonna della Misericordia, who sits in an attitude full of grace, amid\r\na crowd of devotees, shielding them with her mantle from the wrath of\r\nheaven. His rivals occasioned the production of two more altar-pieces:\r\naccording to the example of other eminent men, he answered their sneers\r\nby his classic performances; a retort the most galling to the invidious.\r\nThey had stigmatized him as unequal to large proportions; and he filled\r\na large piece with a single figure of S. Mark, which is admired as a\r\nprodigy of art in the ducal gallery, and is described by a learned\r\nforeigner as a Grecian statue transformed into a picture. He was accused\r\nof being ignorant of the anatomy of the human figure; and to refute this\r\ncalumny he introduced a naked S. Sebastian in another picture, which was\r\nso perfect in drawing and in colouring, that \"it received the unbounded\r\napplause of artists;\" but becoming too much the admiration of the female\r\ndevotees of that church, it was first removed by the fathers into a\r\nprivate room, and was afterwards sold, and sent into France.\r\n\r\nTo sum up all, he knew how to excel at pleasure, in every department of\r\npainting. His design is most chaste, and his youthful faces are more\r\nfull and fleshy than was usual with Raffaello; and according to\r\nAlgarotti, they are but little elevated above the standard of ordinary\r\nmen, and approach to vulgarity. His tints at one period abounded with\r\nshadows produced by lamp black or ivory black, which impairs the value\r\nof some of his pictures; but he gradually acquired a better manner, and,\r\nas we have related, was able to instruct Raffaello. In firmness and\r\nclearness he yields not to the best of the school of Lombardy. He was\r\nthe inventor of a new method of casting draperies; having taught the use\r\nof the wooden figure, with moveable joints, that serves admirably for\r\nthe study of the folds of drapery. None of his school painted them more\r\nvaried and natural, with more breadth, or better adapted to the limbs.\r\nHis works are to be seen in several private collections in Florence; but\r\nthey are rare beyond the precincts of that city: they are there eagerly\r\nsought after by foreigners, but are very rarely to be sold. One of his\r\nMadonnas was procured within these few years by his Excellency the\r\nMajor-Domo of the ducal household, whose collection may be reckoned\r\nanother Florentine Gallery in miniature, consisting of about thirty\r\npictures of the best masters of different schools. The Fathers of S.\r\nMark have a considerable number of his paintings in their private\r\nchapel, and among these is a S. Vincenzo, said by Bottari to resemble a\r\nwork of Tiziano or Giorgione. His best and rarest performances are in\r\nthe possession of the Prince, in whose collection the last work of Fra\r\nBartolommeo remains, a large picture in chiaroscuro, representing the\r\npatron saints of the city surrounding the Virgin Mary. The Gonfalonier\r\nSoderini intended this piece for the Hall of the Council of State; but\r\nit was left only as a design at the death of its author, in 1517, like\r\nthe projected works of Vinci and Bonarruoti. It would seem as if some\r\nfatality attended the decoration of this building, which ought to have\r\nemployed the pencil of the greatest native artists. Among this number\r\nFrate must undoubtedly be included; and Richardson remarks, that had he\r\npossessed the happy combinations of Raffaello, he, perhaps, would not\r\nhave been second to that master.[168] The last mentioned production,\r\nthough imperfect, is looked upon as a model in the art. The method of\r\nthis artist was first to draw the figure naked, then to drape it, and to\r\nform a chiaroscuro, sometimes in oils, that marked the distribution of\r\nthe light and shadow, which constituted his great study, and the soul of\r\nhis pictures. This large picture demonstrates such preparatives; and it\r\nhas as high a value in painting, as the antique plaster models have in\r\nsculpture, in which Winckelmann discovers the stamp of genius and\r\ncompass of design better than in sculptured marbles.\r\n\r\nMariotto Albertinelli, the fellow student and friend of Baccio, the\r\nsharer of his labours and his concerns, emulated his first style, and\r\napproaches to his second in some of his works; but they may be compared\r\nto two streams springing from the same source; the one to become a\r\nbrook, the other a mighty river. Some pictures in Florence are supposed\r\nto be their joint performances; and the Marquis Acciaiuoli possesses a\r\npicture of the Assumption, in the upper part of which are the Apostles,\r\nby Baccio, and the lower is deemed the work of Mariotto. He is somewhat\r\ndry in several of his pictures, as in the S. Silvestro, in Monte Cavallo\r\nat Rome; where he also painted a S. Domenick, and a S. Catharine of\r\nSiena, near the throne of the Virgin Mary. He should likewise be known\r\nat Florence. He executed two pictures for the church of S. Giuliano,\r\nremarkable for the force of colouring, and the many imitations of the\r\nstyle of Frate. The best of all and the nearest to his model is the\r\nVisitation, transferred from the Congregazione de' Preti to the Ducal\r\ngallery, and even to its most honoured place, the Tribune. Albertinelli\r\nobtained great credit by his two pupils, Franciabigio and Innocenzio da\r\nImola, of whom I shall speak in the proper place as ornaments of their\r\nschool. I find Visino praised beyond them both: he painted but little in\r\nFlorence, and that in private; but he was much employed in Hungary.\r\n\r\nBenedetto Cianfanini, Gabriele Rustici, and Cecchin del Frate, who\r\ninherited his master's name, were the scholars of Fra Bartolommeo in his\r\nbest time; but they are no longer known by any undoubted works. Fra\r\nPaolo da Pistoia, his colleague, who was honoured in his own country\r\nwith a medal, which I have seen, with those of many eminent men of\r\nPistoia, in the possession of the Sign. Dottor Visoni, obtained the\r\nrichest inheritance in all the studies of Baccio; and from his designs\r\nthis artist painted many pictures at Pistoia, one of which may be seen\r\nin the parochial church of S. Paul, over the great altar. Those designs\r\nwere afterwards carried to Florence, and in the time of Vasari there was\r\na collection of them at the Dominican convent of S. Catharine, in the\r\nhands of Sister Plautella Nelli. The noble family of this lady possesses\r\na Crucifixion painted by her, in which there is a multitude of small\r\nfigures most highly finished. She seems on the whole a good imitation of\r\nFrate; but she also followed other styles, as may be seen in her\r\nconvent. A Descent from the Cross is there shewn, said to be the design\r\nof Andrea del Sarto, but the execution is by her; and likewise an\r\nEpiphany, entirely her own, in which the landscape would do honour to\r\nthe modern, but the figures savour of the old school.\r\n\r\nAndrea Vannucchi, called Andrea del Sarto, from the occupation of his\r\nfather, is commended by Vasari as the first artist of this school, \"for\r\nbeing the most faultless painter of the Florentines, for perfectly\r\nunderstanding the principles of chiaroscuro, for representing the\r\nindistinctness of objects in shadow, and for painting with a sweetness\r\ntruly natural: he, moreover, taught how to give a perfect union to\r\nfrescos, and in a great measure obviated the necessity of retouching\r\nthem when dry, a circumstance which gives all his works the appearance\r\nof having been finished in one day.\" He is censured by Baldinucci, as\r\nbarren in invention; and undoubtedly he wanted that elevation of\r\nconception, which constitutes the epic in painting as well as in poetry.\r\nDeficient in this talent, Andrea is said to have been modest, elegant,\r\nand endued with sensibility; and it appears that he impressed this\r\ncharacter on nature wherever he employed his pencil. The portico of the\r\nNunziata, transformed by him into a gallery of inestimable value, is the\r\nfittest place to judge of this. Those chaste outlines that procured him\r\nthe surname of _Andrea the Faultless_, those conceptions of graceful\r\ncountenances, whose smiles remind us of the simplicity and grace of\r\nCorreggio,[169] that appropriate architecture, those draperies, adapted\r\nto every condition, and cast with ease, those popular expressions of\r\ncuriosity, of astonishment, of confidence, of compassion, and of joy,\r\nthat never transgress the bounds of decorum, which are understood at\r\nfirst sight, and gently affect the mind without agitating it, are charms\r\nthat are more readily felt than expressed. He who feels what Tubules is\r\nin poetry, may conceive what Andrea is in painting.\r\n\r\nThis artist demonstrates the ascendancy of native genius over precept.\r\nWhen a boy he was put under the tuition of Giovanni Barile, a good\r\ncarver in wood, employed on the ceilings and doors of the Vatican, after\r\nthe designs of Raffaello, but a painter of no celebrity. While still a\r\nyouth, he was consigned to Pier di Cosimo, a practical colourist, but by\r\nno means skilled in drawing or in composition: hence the taste of Andrea\r\nin these arts was formed on the cartoons of Vinci and Bonarruoti; and,\r\nas many circumstances indicate, on the frescos of Masaccio and of\r\nGhirlandaio, in which the subjects were more suited to his mild\r\ndisposition. He went to Rome, but I know not in what year; that he was\r\nthere, appears not to me to admit of dispute, as in the case of\r\nCorreggio. I do not argue this from his style approaching near to that\r\nof Raffaello, as it appeared also to Lomazzo and other writers, though\r\nwith less of ideal beauty. Raffaello and Andrea had studied the same\r\noriginals at Florence; and nature might have given them corresponding\r\nideas for the selection of the beautiful. I ground my opinion entirely\r\non Vasari. He informs us, that Andrea was at Rome, that seeing the works\r\nof the scholars of Raffaello, timidity induced him to despair of\r\nequalling them, and to return speedily to Florence. If we credit so many\r\nother stories of the pusillanimity of Andrea, why should we reject this?\r\nor what faith shall we give to Vasari, if he was erroneous in a\r\ncircumstance relating to one who was his master, and which was written\r\nin Florence soon after the death of Andrea, while his scholars, his\r\nfriends, and even his wife, were still living, an assertion, too,\r\nuncontradicted in the second edition, in which Vasari retracted so much\r\nof what he had affirmed in the first?\r\n\r\nHis improvement and his progress from one perfection in art to another\r\nwas thus not sudden, as has happened to some other artists; but was\r\ngradually acquired during many years residence at Florence. There, \"by\r\nreflecting on what he had seen, he attained such eminence that his works\r\nhave been esteemed, and admired, and even more imitated after his death,\r\nthan in his lifetime:\" so says the historian. This implies that he\r\nimproved at Rome; chiefly, however, by his own genius, which led him, as\r\nit were, by the hand, from one step to another, as may be observed in\r\nthe Compagnia dello Scalzo, and in the convent of the Servi, where some\r\nof his pictures, executed at different periods, are to be seen. At the\r\nScalzo, he painted some stories from the life of S. John in chiaroscuro,\r\nthe cartoons for which are in the Rinuccini palace: in this work we may\r\nnotice some palpable imitations, and even some figures borrowed from\r\nAlbert Durer. We may trace his early style in the Baptism of Christ; his\r\nsubsequent progress, in some other pictures, as in the Visitation,\r\npainted some years after; and his greatest excellence and broadest\r\nmanner in others, especially in the Birth of the Baptist. In like\r\nmanner, the pictures from the life of S. Filippo Benizi, in the lesser\r\ncloister of the Servi, are very beautiful productions, though they are\r\namong the first efforts of Andrea's genius. The Epiphany of our Saviour,\r\nand the Birth of the Virgin in the same place, are more finished works;\r\nbut his finest piece is that Holy Family in Repose, which is usually\r\ncalled _Madonna del Sacco_, from the sack of grain on which S. Joseph\r\nleans, than which few pictures are more celebrated in the history of the\r\nart. It has frequently been engraved; but after two centuries and a\r\nhalf, it has at length employed an engraver worthy of it in Morghen, who\r\nhas recently executed it, and also a similar composition after\r\nRaffaello. Both prints are in the best collections; and to those who\r\nhave not seen either Rome or Florence, Andrea appears rather a rival\r\nthan an inferior to the prince of painters. On examining this picture\r\nnarrowly, it affords endless scope for observation: it is finished as if\r\nintended for a cabinet; every hair is distinguished, every middle tint\r\nis lowered with consummate art, every outline marked with admirable\r\nvariety and grace: and amid all this diligence a facility is\r\nconspicuous, that makes the whole appear natural and unconstrained.\r\n\r\nIn the ducal palace at Poggio a Caiano, there is a fresco picture of\r\nCaesar, seated in a hall, ornamented with statues, on a lofty seat, to\r\nwhom a great variety of exotic birds and wild animals are presented as\r\nthe tribute of his victories; a work of itself sufficient to mark Andrea\r\nas a painter eminent in perspective, in a knowledge of the antique, and\r\nin every excellence of painting. The order for ornamenting that palace\r\ncame from Leo X.; and Andrea, who had there to contend with Franciabigio\r\nand Pontormo, exerted all his energy to please that encourager of art,\r\nand to surpass his competitors. The other artists seem to have been\r\ndiscouraged, and did not proceed: some years after Alessandro Allori put\r\na finishing hand to the hall. The royal palace possesses a treasure in\r\nthe oil pictures of Andrea. Independent of the S. Francis, the\r\nAssumption, and other pictures, collected by the family of the Medici,\r\nthe Grand Duke Leopold purchased a very fine _Pieta_ from the nuns of\r\nLugo, and placed it in the Tribune as an honour to the school. The\r\nintroduction of S. Peter and S. Paul in that piece, contrary to\r\nhistorical facts, is not the error of the painter who represented them\r\nso admirably, but of those who commissioned the picture. Critics have\r\nremarked a slight defect in the dead Christ, which they think sustains\r\nitself more, and has a greater fulness of the veins, than is suitable to\r\na dead body: but this is immaterial in a picture the other parts of\r\nwhich are designed, coloured, and composed, so as to excite\r\nastonishment. A Last Supper, if it were not confined to the cloisters of\r\nthe monastery of S. Salvi, would, perhaps, be equally admired. The\r\nsoldiers who besieged Florence in 1529, and destroyed the suburbs of the\r\ncity, undoubtedly admired it: after demolishing the belfry, the church,\r\nand part of the monastery, they were astonished on beholding this Last\r\nSupper, and had not resolution to destroy it; imitating that Demetrius\r\nwho, at the siege of Rhodes, is said to have respected nothing but a\r\npicture by Protegenes.[170]\r\n\r\nAndrea painted a great deal; and on this account is well known beyond\r\nthe limits of his own country. Perhaps his best performance in the hands\r\nof strangers is a picture translated to a palace in Genoa from the\r\nchurch of the Domenicans of Sarzana, who possess several others, very\r\nbeautiful. It is composed in the manner of F. Bartolommeo; and besides\r\nthe Saints distributed around the Virgin, or on the steps, four of whom\r\nare standing and two on their knees, there are two large figures in the\r\nforeground that seem to start from the lower part of the picture, and\r\nare seen as high as the knee. I am aware that this disposition of the\r\nfigures displeases the critics; yet it gives variety in the position of\r\nso many figures, and introduces a great distance between the nearest and\r\nmost remote, by which the space seems augmented, and every figure\r\nproduces effect. The best collections are not deficient in his Holy\r\nFamilies. The Marquis Rinuccini, at Florence, possesses two; and some of\r\nthe illustrious Romans have even a greater number; but all different,\r\nexcept that the features of the Virgin, which Andrea usually copied from\r\nhis wife, have always some resemblance. Many others may be seen in Rome\r\nand in Florence, and not a few in Lombardy, besides those noticed in the\r\ncatalogues of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nSo much genius merited success: and yet if one was to write a book on\r\nthe misfortunes of painters, as has already been done on those of\r\nauthors, nothing would awaken more compassion than the lot of Andrea.\r\nThe poverty of Correggio is exaggerated, or perhaps untrue; the misery\r\nof Domenichino had a termination; the Caracci were ill rewarded, but\r\nlived in easy circumstances. Andrea, from his marriage with Lucrezia del\r\nFede until his death, was almost always pressed with griefs. In his\r\nfirst edition, Vasari says, that he was despised by his friends, and\r\nabandoned by his employers, from the time of his marriage with this\r\nwoman; that, the slave of her will, he left his father and mother to\r\nstarve; that through her arrogance and violence none of the scholars of\r\nAndrea could continue long with him; and this must have happened to\r\nVasari himself. In the second edition he omitted this censure, either\r\nbecause he repented of it, or was appeased; but did not, however,\r\nconceal that she was a perpetual source of misfortune to her husband. He\r\nthere repeated that Andrea was invited to the French court by Francis I.\r\nwhere, caressed and rewarded, he might have excited the envy of every\r\nartist; but influenced by the womanish complaints of Lucrezia, he\r\nreturned to Florence; and remained in his own country, in violation of\r\nhis faith solemnly pledged to that monarch. He afterwards repented and\r\nwas anxious to regain his former situation; but his efforts were\r\nineffectual. He dragged out a miserable existence, amid jealousy and\r\ndomestic wretchedness, until, infected with the plague, and abandoned by\r\nhis wife and every other individual, he died, in 1530, in the\r\nforty-second year of his age, and had a very mean funeral.\r\n\r\nThe two who approximated most nearly to the style of Andrea were Marco\r\nAntonio Francia Bigi, as he is named by Baldinucci, called also\r\nFranciabigio, or Francia, as Vasari denominates him, and Pontormo.\r\nFrancia was the scholar of Albertinelli for a few months, and then\r\nappears to have formed himself on the best models of the school; and few\r\nare commended so highly by Vasari for a knowledge of anatomy, for\r\nperspective, for the daily habit of drawing the naked figure, and the\r\nexquisite finish of all his performances. One of his Annunciations was\r\nformerly in S. Pier Maggiore; the figures were small and highly\r\nfinished, accompanied by good architecture, but not without a certain\r\ndegree of dryness. Andrea, his friend, and the associate of his studies,\r\nhelped him to a more elevated style. From a companion Francia became his\r\nenthusiastic follower; but, inferior in talents, he never attained the\r\nart of representing such sweetness of disposition, affection so true,\r\nand grace so natural. A semicircular piece of his, representing the\r\nMarriage of the Virgin, may be seen near the works of Andrea, in the\r\ncloister of the Nunziata, where we recognize him as a painter who sought\r\nto attain by labour what the other accomplished by genius. This work was\r\nnever completed. Some of the monks having uncovered it before it was\r\nfinished, the artist was so offended that he struck the work some blows\r\nwith a hammer, in order to deface it; and though they prevented his\r\naccomplishing this, he never after could be prevailed on to complete it,\r\nand no other dared to undertake the task. He was a competitor with\r\nAndrea also in the Scalzo, where he executed two histories that are not\r\nmuch eclipsed by the pictures in their vicinity. He imitated his friend\r\nlikewise at Poggio a Caiano, in a picture of the return of Cicero from\r\nexile: a work of merit, though never finished. It is the great glory of\r\nhis pencil, that it was so often employed in contending with Andrea, in\r\nwhom it awakened emulation and industry, from the fear of being\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\nJacopo Carrucci, called Pontormo, from the place of his nativity, was a\r\nman of rare genius, whose early productions obtained the admiration of\r\nRaffaello and Michelangiolo. He got a few lessons from Vinci, and was\r\nafterwards under the care of Albertinelli, and Pier di Cosimo, but he\r\nfinally became the pupil of Andrea. He excited the jealousy of this\r\nmaster, was induced by unhandsome treatment to withdraw from his school,\r\nand afterwards became not only the imitator of Andrea, but his rival in\r\nmany undertakings. The Visitation in the cloister of the Servi, the\r\npicture of several saints at S. Michelino, the two pictures of the\r\nHistory of Joseph, represented in minute figures, in an apartment of the\r\nducal gallery, shew that he trod without difficulty in the footsteps of\r\nhis master, and that congeniality of talent led him into a similar path.\r\nI use the term similar; for he is not a copyist, like those who borrow\r\nheads or whole figures, but invariably retains a peculiar originality. I\r\nsaw one of his Holy Families in the possession of the Marquis Cerbone\r\nPucci, along with others by Baccio, by Rosso, and Andrea: the picture by\r\nPontormo vied with them all; but yet was sufficiently characteristic.\r\n\r\nHe had a certain singularity of disposition, and readily abandoned one\r\nstyle to try a better; but he was often unsuccessful; as likewise\r\nhappened to Nappi, of Milan; to Sacchi, of Rome; and to every other\r\nartist who has made this attempt, at an age too far advanced for a\r\nchange of manner. The Carthusian Monastery at Florence has some of his\r\nworks, from which connoisseurs have inferred the three styles attributed\r\nto him. The first is correct in design, vigorous in colouring, and\r\napproaches the manner of Andrea. In the second the drawing is good, but\r\nthe colouring somewhat languid; and this style became the model for\r\nBronzino and the artists of the succeeding epoch. The third is a close\r\nimitation of Albert Durer, not only in the composition but in the heads\r\nand draperies; a manner certainly unworthy of so promising an outset. It\r\nis difficult to find specimens of Pontormo in this style, except some\r\nhistories of the Passion, which he servilely copied from the prints of\r\nAlbert Durer, for the cloister of that monastery, where he trifled away\r\nseveral years. We might perhaps notice a fourth manner, if the Deluge\r\nand Last Judgment, on which he spent eleven years at S. Lorenzo, had\r\nstill existed: but this his last performance, with the tacit consent of\r\nevery artist, was whitewashed. Here he attempted to imitate\r\nMichelangiolo, and like him to afford a model of the anatomical style,\r\nwhich at this time began to be extolled at Florence above every other:\r\nbut he taught us a different lesson, and only succeeded in demonstrating\r\nthat an old man ought not to become the votary of fashion.\r\n\r\nAndrea pursued the custom of Raffaello and other artists of that age, in\r\nconducting his works with the assistance of painters experienced in his\r\nstyle, whether they were friends or scholars; a remark not useless to\r\nthose who may trace in his pictures the labours of another pencil. It is\r\nknown that he gave Pontormo some pieces to finish, and that he retained\r\none Jacone, and a Domenico Puligo; two individuals who possessed a\r\nnatural turn for painting, ready and willing to try every species of\r\nimitation, and more desirous of recreation than of fame. The facade of\r\nthe Buondelmonte Palace, at S. Trinita, by the former, was highly\r\nextolled. It was in chiaroscuro; the drawing, in which department he\r\nexcelled, was very beautiful, and the whole conducted in the manner of\r\nAndrea. He also executed some oil pictures at Cortona, which are much\r\ncommended by Vasari. Domenico Puligo was less skilled in design than in\r\ncolouring: his tints were sweet, harmonious, and clear, but he\r\napparently aimed at covering the outline, to relieve him from the\r\nnecessity of perfect accuracy. By this mark he is sometimes recognized\r\nin Madonnas and in cabinet pictures, (his usual occupation) which having\r\nbeen perhaps designed by Andrea, at first sight pass for the work of\r\nthat master. Domenico Conti was likewise very intimate with Andrea, was\r\nhis scholar and the heir to his drawings; and that great artist was\r\nhonoured with a tomb and epitaph designed by Conti, in the vicinity of\r\nhis own immortal works in the Nunziata. Excepting this circumstance,\r\nVasari notices nothing praiseworthy in Conti, and therefore I shall take\r\nno more notice of him. He gives a more favourable opinion of\r\nPierfrancesco di Jacopo di Sandro, on account of his three pictures in\r\nthe church of S. Spirito. He makes honourable mention of two other\r\nartists, who lived long in France, viz. Nannoccio and Andrea Squazzella,\r\nwho always retained a similarity to the style of Andrea del Sarto. It is\r\nnot our present business to notice those who abandoned it; for in this\r\nwork it is my wish to keep sight rather of the different styles than of\r\nthe masters.\r\n\r\nThe fine copies that so often pass for originals, in Florence and other\r\nplaces, are chiefly the work of the above mentioned artists; nor does it\r\nseem credible that Andrea copied so closely his own inventions, and\r\nreduced them with his own hand from the great scale to small dimensions.\r\nI have seen one of his Holy Families, in which S. Elizabeth appears, in\r\nten or twelve collections; and other pictures in three or four private\r\nhouses. I found the S. Lorenzo surrounded by other saints, at the Pitti\r\nPalace, in the Albani gallery; the Visitation, in the Giustiniani\r\npalace; the Birth of our Lady, in the convent of the Servi, in the\r\npossession of Sig. Pirri, at Rome: all these are beautiful little\r\npictures, all on small panels, all of the old school, and all believed\r\nthe work of Andrea. It seems to me not improbable that the best of these\r\nwere at least painted in his studio, and retouched by him, a practice\r\nadopted by Tiziano, and even by Raffaello.\r\n\r\nRosso, who contended in the cloisters of the Nunziata, with the best\r\nmasters, and who appears in his Assumption to have aimed at a work not\r\nso much superior in beauty as in size to the productions of the other\r\nartists, is among the greatest painters of his school. Endowed with a\r\ncreative fancy, he disdained to follow any of his countrymen or\r\nstrangers; and indeed one recognizes much originality in his style: his\r\nheads are more spirited, his head dresses and ornaments are more\r\ntasteful, his colouring more lively, his distribution of light and shade\r\nbroader, and his pencilling more firm and free, than had been hitherto\r\nseen in Florence. He appears in short to have introduced into that\r\nschool a peculiar spirit, that would have been unexceptionable, had it\r\nnot been mingled with something of extravagance. Thus, in the\r\nTransfiguration at Citta di Castello, instead of the Apostles he\r\nintroduced a band of gypsies at the bottom of the picture. His picture\r\nin the Pitti palace, however, is far removed from any such fault. It\r\nexhibits various saints, grouped in so excellent a manner, that the\r\nchiaroscuro of one figure contributes to the relief of another; and it\r\nhas such beautiful contrasts of colour and of light, such energy of\r\ndrawing and of attitude, that it arrests attention by its originality.\r\nHe likewise painted for the State: an unfinished Descent from the Cross\r\nmay be seen in the oratory of S. Carlo, in Volterra; and another in the\r\nchurch of S. Chiara at Citta S. Sepolcro; in the cathedral of which\r\nthere are many old pictures. Its great merit consists in the principal\r\ngroup, and that twilight, or almost nocturnal tint, that gives a tone to\r\nthe whole piece, sombre, true, and worthy of any Flemish artist. The\r\nworks of this painter are very scarce in Italy; for he went to France\r\ninto the employment of Francis I. during his best time, and\r\nsuperintended the ornamental painting and plaster work then going on at\r\nFontainebleau. Whilst engaged in this work, he unhappily put an end to\r\nhis existence by poison; and in the enlargement of the building many of\r\nhis works were defaced by Primaticcio, who was a rival, but not a\r\nfollower, as is pretended by Cellini.[171] Thirteen pictures, dedicated\r\nto the fame and actions of Francis I. have escaped, and are described by\r\nAbbe Guget, in his Memoir on the Royal Academy of France.[172] Among\r\nthese is the remarkable one of Ignorance Banished by that monarch; a\r\npicture that has been three different times engraved. He was assisted in\r\nthose works by several artists, amongst whom were three Florentine\r\npainters, Domenico del Barbieri, Bartolommeo Miniati, and Luca Penni,\r\nthe brother of that Gianfrancesco, called Il Fattore in the school of\r\nRaffaello.\r\n\r\nRidolfo di Domenico Ghirlandaio lost his father in his infancy; but was\r\nso well initiated in the art, first by his paternal uncle Davide, and\r\nafterwards by Frate, that when Raffaello d'Urbino came to Florence, he\r\nbecame his admirer and his friend. On his departure from that city he\r\nleft with him a Madonna, intended for Siena, that it might be completed\r\nby him; and having soon after gone to Rome, he invited him to assist in\r\nthe decorations of the Vatican. Ridolfo declined this, unfortunately for\r\nhis own name, which might thus have rivalled that of Giulio Romano. He\r\nundoubtedly possessed a facility, elegance, and vivacity of manner, to\r\nenable him to follow closely the style of his friend. That he was\r\nambitious of imitating him, may be inferred from the pictures in his\r\nearly manner, preserved in the church of S. Jacopo di Ripoli, and S.\r\nGirolamo, that bear some resemblance to the manner of Perugino, like the\r\nearly productions of Raffaello. His taste is displayed to more advantage\r\nin two pictures, filled with many moderate sized figures, which were\r\ntransferred from the Academy of Design to the Royal Gallery. They\r\nrepresent two stories of S. Zenobi, and perhaps approach nearer to the\r\ntwo pictures by Pinturicchio, in the cathedral of Siena, that were\r\npainted under the direction, and partly by the assistance of Raffaello,\r\nthan to any other model; with this exception, that they retain more\r\ntraces of the old school. We may remark, in the pictures of Ridolfo,\r\nsome figures strikingly like those of Raffaello; and in the whole there\r\nappears a composition, an expression, and skill in improving nature to\r\nthe standard of ideal beauty, apparently proceeding from principles\r\nconformable to the maxims of that great master. That he did not\r\nafterwards perfect them, is to be attributed to his not having seen the\r\nbest productions of his friend, and to his study of the art having been\r\nretarded by his commercial pursuits.\r\n\r\nOn modernizing his manner, and by this means obtaining reputation, he\r\naimed at nothing further; and continued to study painting rather as an\r\namusement, than as a profession. He assembled round him artists of every\r\ndescription, and disdained not to impart advice to painters of ensigns,\r\nof furniture, or of scenes; still less to those who executed pictures\r\nfor cabinets or churches. Many such who flourished about the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century, are mentioned in history either as his pupils, or\r\nhis companions. The following is a brief catalogue of them. Michele di\r\nRidolfo assumed his name; because, on passing from the schools of Credi\r\nand Sogliani into that of Ridolfo, he was treated not so much as a\r\ncompanion as a son, till the death of Ghirlandaio. They painted many\r\npictures conjointly, which always pass under their name; and of this\r\nnumber is the S. Anne of Citta di Castello; an exquisite picture, both\r\nfor elegance of design, and a peculiar fulness of colouring. Michele was\r\nparticularly eminent in this department, which he diligently studied in\r\nhis own works, and employed in his fresco pictures over several of the\r\ngates of the city; and he was selected by Vasari as the companion of his\r\nlabours. Mariano da Pescia must have been much esteemed by Ridolfo; for\r\nwhen this master painted the frescos in the State Chapel of the Old\r\nPalace, a work which gained him high honour, he wished the smaller\r\npieces to be painted by Mariano. There is a Holy Family in that place,\r\nin a firm but agreeable style: it is the only remaining production of\r\nthis artist, who died young. He was of the Gratiadei family; a piece of\r\ninformation for which, with various others, I am indebted to the\r\npoliteness of his fellow citizen Sig. Innocenzio Ansaldi, an able\r\nwriter, both in poetry and prose, in whatever relates to the art. Carlo\r\nPortelli da Loro in Valdarno, proceeded from the same school. He painted\r\nmuch in the City, and sometimes with little harmony: yet the testimony\r\nof Vasari, and the picture of S. Romulus, which remains at the Santa,\r\ndemonstrate his ability as an artist. Of Antonio del Ceraiuolo, little\r\nremains to commemorate the painter but the name. Mirabello da\r\nSalincorno, who was employed on the funeral obsequies of Bonarruoti,\r\ndevoted himself to cabinet pictures; and an Annunciation, with his name,\r\nand the date of 1565, is said to be in the hands of the Baldovinetti\r\nfamily. It would be tiresome to follow Vasari, who, in several passages\r\nof his history, mentions artists now sunk into oblivion, that might have\r\nfound a place here. I close the list with two illustrious names, Perino\r\ndel Vaga, already noticed, but afterwards to be more frequently\r\nmentioned; and Toto del Nunziata, reckoned by the English the best of\r\nthe Italian artists, who, in that century visited their island; though\r\nalmost unknown among us.[173] He was the son of an obscure artist, but\r\nobtained celebrity; and Perino himself had not a more formidable rival\r\nin the school of Ridolfo.\r\n\r\nThis glorious epoch was not deficient in good landscape painters;\r\nalthough the art of landscape painting without figures was not yet in\r\ngreat repute. Vasari highly praises in this line one Antonio di Donnino\r\nMazzieri, a scholar of Franciabigio, a bold designer, and a man of great\r\ninvention in representing horses, and in landscape.\r\n\r\nThe grotesque came into fashion through the efforts of Morto da Feltro,\r\nand Giovanni da Udine. Both artists were settled at Florence, and there\r\npainted; especially the second, who decorated the palace of the Medicean\r\nfamily, and the chapel in the church of S. Lorenzo. Andrea, called di\r\nCosimo, because he was the scholar of Rosselli, learnt this art from\r\nMorto,[174] and he obtained the surname of Feltrini, or perhaps\r\nFeltrino, from his best known master. He exercised the invention not\r\nonly on walls but on furniture, on banners and festive decorations:\r\nabounding in fancy, he was the leader of a taste originating with him,\r\nand much imitated in Florence. His ornaments were more copious and rich\r\nthan those of the ancients; were united in a different manner, and his\r\nfigures were admirably adapted to them. Mariotto and Raffaello Mettidoro\r\nwere his associates; but no artist was more employed than he in\r\ndesigning foliage for brocades on cloth, or in ornamental painting. Pier\r\ndi Cosimo, and Bachiacca, or Bachicca, were very eminent in the\r\ngrotesque; of whom, with others who began the study about the end of the\r\nfirst Epoch, I have already treated, among the old masters: but none of\r\nthem modernized more than the latter, who was usually employed on small\r\nsubjects, particularly on the furniture of private houses, and on small\r\npictures, many of which were sent to England. About the time of his\r\ndecease he was employed by the Duke Cosmo. He drew most elegant small\r\nhistorical designs for tapestry and beds, which were executed by his\r\nbrother Antonio, an embroiderer whom Varchi commends; and by Gio. Rossi,\r\nand Niccolo Fiamminghi, who introduced the art of tapestry weaving into\r\nFlorence.[175] His best work was a cabinet, which he ornamented\r\ndivinely, says Vasari, with flowers and birds in oil colours.\r\n\r\nPerspective was not cultivated in Italy during the 15th century, except\r\nso far as subservient to historical painting, and in this department the\r\nVenetian and Lombard masters were no less eminent than those of Florence\r\nor of Rome. After this period, artists began to represent arches,\r\ncolonnades, porticos, and every other kind of architecture, in pictures\r\nappropriated to such subjects, to the great ornament of the theatres,\r\nand of religious and convivial festivities. One of the first who devoted\r\nhimself to this study was Bastiano di Sangallo, the nephew of Giuliano,\r\nand of Antonio, and the brother of another Antonio, all of whom were\r\neminent in architecture. He got the surname of Aristotile, from his\r\ndisquisitions on anatomy, or on perspective, accompanied by a certain\r\nphilosophic authority and ingenuity. He acquired the principles of his\r\nart from Pietro Perugino, but he soon abandoned his school, to adopt a\r\nmore modern style. He exercised himself for several years in painting\r\nfigures; he copied some subjects after his friends Michelangiolo and\r\nRaffaello; and aided by the advice of Andrea and Ridolfo, he produced\r\nnot a few Madonnas and other pictures of his own composition: but not\r\npossessing invention in an eminent degree he latterly dedicated his\r\nattention wholly to perspective, in which he was initiated by Bramante;\r\nand exercised it during this epoch, when Florence abounded with grand\r\nfuneral obsequies, and public festivities. Of these, the most memorable\r\nwere those instituted on the election of Leo X. in 1513, and on his\r\nvisit to Florence in 1515. He had in his train Michelangiolo, Raffaello,\r\nand other professors of the art, to deliberate concerning the facade of\r\nthe church of S. Lorenzo, and other works which he meditated. His court\r\nadded pomp to every spectacle; and Florence became, as it were, a new\r\ncity. Arches were erected in the streets by Granacci and Rosso; temples\r\nor new facades were designed by Antonio da San Gallo, and Jacopo\r\nSansovino; chiaroscuros were prepared by Andrea del Sarto; grotesques by\r\nFeltrino; basso-relievos, statues, and colossal figures, by Sansovino\r\nabove mentioned, by Rustici, and Bandinelli; Ghirlandaio, Pontormo,\r\nFranciabigio, and Ubertini, adorned with exquisite taste the residence\r\nof the pontiff. I say nothing of the meaner artists, although in another\r\nage even these would not have been classed with the vulgar herd, but\r\nhave obtained distinction: I shall content myself with observing that\r\nthis emulation of genius, this display of the fine arts, in short this\r\nauspicious period, sufficed to confer on Florence the lasting\r\nappellation of another Athens; on Leo the name of another Pericles or\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\nSpectacles of this sort became afterwards more common to the citizens;\r\nfor the Medici, on commencing their domination over a people whom they\r\nfeared, affected popularity, like the Roman Caesars, by promoting public\r\nhilarity. Hence, not only on extraordinary occasions, such as the\r\nelevation of Clement VII. to the papal chair, of Alexander, and of Cosmo\r\nto the chief magistracy of their country, on the marriage of the latter,\r\non that of Giuliano and of Lorenzo de' Medici, and on the arrival of\r\nCharles V.; not only on such occasions, but frequently at other times,\r\nthey instituted tournaments, masquerades, and representations, of which\r\nthe decorations were magnificent, such as cars, robes, and scenery. In\r\nthis improved state of every thing conducive to exquisite embellishment,\r\nindustry became excited, and the number of painters and ornamental\r\nartists increased. Aristotile, to return to him, was always much\r\nemployed; his perspectives were in great request in public places; his\r\nscenes in the theatre: the populace, unaccustomed to those ocular\r\ndeceptions, were astonished; and it seemed to them as if they could\r\nascend the steps, enter the edifices, and approach the balconies and\r\nwindows in the pictures. The long life of Aristotile, coeval with the\r\nbest epoch of painting, permitted him to serve the ruling family and his\r\ncountry, until his old age, when Salviati and Bronzino began to be\r\npreferred to him. He died in 1551.\r\n\r\nWhile the city of Florence acquired so much glory by the genius of her\r\nartists, the other parts of the state afforded materials for future\r\nhistory, chiefly through the assistance of the Roman school. This\r\nhappened more especially after 1527, when the sack of Rome dispersed the\r\nschool of Raffaello and its young branches. Giulio Romano trained\r\nBenedetto Pagni at Pescia, who ought to be noticed among the assistants\r\nof his master at Mantua. If we credit some late writers, his native\r\nplace possesses many of his works: but I acquiesce in the opinion of\r\nSig. Ansaldi, in refusing to admit any of them as genuine, except the\r\nfacade of the habitation of the Pagni family, now injured by time, and\r\nthe picture of the Marriage of Cana in the Collegiate church, which is\r\nnot his best production. Pistoia is indebted to Gio. Francesco Penni, or\r\nperhaps to Fattore, for a respectable scholar: this was Lionardo, an\r\nartist much employed in Naples and in Rome, where he was named Il\r\nPistoia. I find him surnamed Malatesta by some, Guelfo by others; but I\r\nsuspect that his true family name is to be collected from an inscription\r\non an Annunciation in the little chapel of the canons of Lucca, which\r\nruns thus, _Leonardus Gratia Pistoriensis_. I am indebted to Sig. T. F.\r\nBernardi above mentioned for this fact: and the picture is worthy of a\r\ndescendant of Raffaello. I do not know that there is a single trace of\r\nLionardo remaining in his native place: at the village of Guidi, in the\r\ndiocese of Pistoia, one of his pictures is to be seen in the church of\r\nS. Peter, where the titular, and three other saints, stand around the\r\nthrone of the Virgin.[176] Sebastiano Vini came from Verona, in I know\r\nnot what year of the 16th century, and was enrolled among the citizens\r\nof Pistoia. His reputation and his pictures did honour to the country\r\nthat adopted him. He left many works both in oil and fresco; but his\r\nmost extraordinary production was in the suppressed church of S.\r\nDesiderio. The facade over the great altar was storied with the\r\ncrucifixion of the ten thousand martyrs, a work abounding in figures and\r\ninvention. I have noticed the younger Zacchia of Lucca, who belongs to\r\nthis epoch, in the preceding one, that I might not separate the father\r\nand the son. I am unable to find any other artists sufficiently worthy\r\nof record in this district of Tuscany.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of it we may turn our eyes to Cortona, and notice\r\ntwo good artists. The one was Francesco Signorelli, the nephew of Luca,\r\nwho, though unnoticed by Vasari, shows himself a painter worthy of\r\npraise, by a circular picture of the patron saints of the city, which\r\nwas executed for the council hall, in 1320; after which period he lived\r\nat least forty years. The other was Tommaso Paparello, or Papacello,\r\nboth which names are given him by Vasari, when writing of his two\r\nmasters, Caporali and Giulio Romano. He assisted them both, but I can\r\ndiscover no trace of any work wholly his own.\r\n\r\nBorgo, afterwards named Citta San Sepolcro, could then boast its\r\nRaffaello, commonly called Raffaellino dal Colle, born at a small place\r\na few miles from Borgo. He is reckoned among the disciples of Raffaello;\r\nbut rather belongs to the school of Giulio, whose pupil, dependant, or\r\nassistant in his labours at Rome, and in the _Te_ at Mantua, he is\r\nconsidered by Vasari. It is singular that he did not write a separate\r\nlife of this artist; but assigns him scanty praise in a few scattered\r\nanecdotes. His merit is but little known to the public, as he painted\r\nfor the most part in his native place, or the neighbouring cities; and I\r\nam able to add to the catalogue of his pictures from having seen them.\r\nHe has two pictures at Citta San Sepolcro, his only works specified by\r\nVasari. One represents the resurrection of our Saviour, who, full of\r\nmajesty, regards the soldiers around the sepulchre with an air of\r\ndispleasure, which fills them with terror. This very spirited picture is\r\nin the Church of S. Rocco, and is repeated in the cathedral. The other,\r\nwhich is in the Osservanti of S. Francis, represents the Assumption of\r\nthe Virgin; a piece agreeable both in colouring and design, but its\r\nvalue is diminished by a figure I am unable to explain, drawn at one\r\nside of it by another hand. The same subject is treated in the church of\r\nthe Conventual friars, at Citta di Castello, where great beauty is\r\njoined to the highest possible finish, but it loses something of its\r\neffect by standing opposite to a fine picture by Vasari, which throws it\r\nstrongly into the shade. An entombing of Christ by Raffaellino, is in\r\nthe Servi; a very beautiful picture, but the colouring is less firm; and\r\nthere is another of his works at S. Angelo with S. Michael, and S.\r\nSebastian, who humbly presents an arrow, a type of his martyrdom, to the\r\ninfant Jesus and the Virgin. In this the composition is simple but\r\ngraceful in every part. A picture of our Lady, with S. Sebastian, S.\r\nRocco, and a canonized bishop, painted in a similar style, is to be seen\r\nin the church of S. Francis of Cagli; in it the figures and the\r\nlandscape much resemble the manner of Raffaello. His Apostles in the\r\nsacristy of the cathedral of Urbino are noble figures, draped in a grand\r\nstyle, in small oblong pictures, firmly coloured. The Olivet monks of\r\nGubbio have in one of their chapels a Nativity by Raffaellino, and two\r\npieces from the history of S. Benedict, painted in fresco, in which he\r\nwas, I believe, assisted by his scholars. The former is certainly\r\nsuperior to the two last, although he has introduced in them real\r\nportraits, finely conceived architecture, and added a figure of Virtue\r\nin the upper part, that seems a sister of the Sybils of Raffaello. He\r\nalso painted, in the castle of Perugia, and in the _Imperiale_ of\r\nPesaro, a villa of the duke of Urbino, to whom he afforded more\r\nsatisfaction than the two Dossi. After having assisted Raffaello and\r\nGiulio, he disdained not to paint after the designs of less eminent\r\nartists. On the arrival of Charles V. at Florence, in 1536, he assisted\r\nVasari, who was one of the decorators; and he painted cartoons after the\r\ndesigns of Bronzino, for the tapestry of Cosmo I.; after which period I\r\ndo not find him mentioned. Another instance of his diffidence is the\r\nfollowing: on the arrival of Rosso at San Sepolcro, Raffaellino, out of\r\nrespect to that artist, gave up to him an order for a picture which he\r\nwas to have executed; a rare instance among painters, who are in the\r\nhabit of using kindly those artists only, who come merely to see a city,\r\nand immediately leave it. He kept a school at San Sepolcro, whence\r\nproceeded Gherardi, Vecchi, and other artists, some of whom, perhaps,\r\nsurpassed him in genius; but they did not equal him in grace, nor in\r\nhigh finish.\r\n\r\nAbout this time many artists flourished in Arezzo, but of these two only\r\nare praised by Vasari, who is not sparing in his commendations of the\r\nFlorentines, as I have remarked, but deals them scantily to his own\r\ntownsmen. Giovanni Antonio, the son of Matteo Lappoli, was the scholar\r\nof Pontormo, and the friend of Perino and of Rosso, with whom he lived\r\nin Tuscany, and whose style he emulated in Rome. He was more employed in\r\npainting for private houses than for churches. Guglielmo, surnamed Da\r\nMarcilla, by Vasari, a foreigner by birth, became a citizen of Arezzo\r\nfrom inclination and long residence; he was dear to the citizens, who\r\nafforded him the means of enjoying life, and grateful to the city, where\r\nhe left most beautiful monuments of his genius. He had been a Dominican\r\nin his own country; he became a secular priest on arriving in Italy, and\r\nat Arezzo he was called the Prior. He was an excellent painter on glass,\r\nand on this account, was brought to Rome by one Claude, a Frenchman, to\r\nexecute windows for Julius II.; but he also employed himself in fresco.\r\nHe studied design in Italy, and so improved in that art, that his works\r\nat Rome seem designs of the fourteenth century, while the Aretine ones\r\nappear the work of a modern. He painted some ceilings and arches in the\r\ncathedral, with scriptural subjects in fresco. In design he followed\r\nMichelangiolo, as nearly as he could; but his colouring was not firm.\r\nHis paintings on glass are quite in a different style; there, to very\r\ngood drawing, and uncommon expression, he joined tints that partake of\r\nthe emerald, the ruby, and of oriental sapphire, and which, when\r\nilluminated by the sun, exhibit all the brilliance of the rainbow. In\r\nArezzo, there are so many windows of this glass at the cathedral, at S.\r\nFrancis, and at many other churches, that they might excite the envy of\r\nmuch larger cities. They are so finely wrought with subjects from the\r\nNew Testament, and other scriptural histories, that they seem to have\r\nreached the perfection of the art. The Vocation of S. Matthew, in a\r\nwindow of the cathedral, is highly praised by Vasari; it exhibits\r\n\"perspectives of temples and flights of steps, figures so finely\r\ncomposed, landscapes so well executed, that one can hardly imagine they\r\nwere glass, but something sent down from Heaven for the delight of\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\nThis place and period remind me, that before I pass on to another epoch,\r\nI ought to say a few words concerning the invention of painting on\r\nglass, which was anciently likewise styled Mosaic, because it was\r\ncomposed of pieces of different coloured glass, connected by lead, which\r\nrepresented the shadows. We may observe glass windows that emulate well\r\ncomposed pictures on canvass or on panel; and this art is treated of by\r\nVasari in the thirty-second chapter of the introduction to his work.\r\nFrom the preface to the treatise _De omni scientia artis pingendi_, by\r\nTheophilus the Monk, I find that France was celebrated for this art\r\nbeyond any other country;[177] and there the art seems to have been\r\ninvariably cultivated, and brought by degrees to perfection. From the\r\nearliest ages of the revival of painting, the Italians wrought windows\r\nwith different coloured glasses, as is remarked by P. Angeli in his\r\ndescription of the churches of Assisi, where the most ancient specimens\r\nare to be seen. In the church likewise of the Franciscan friars at\r\nVenice, we find that one _Frater Theotonius_, a German, worked in\r\ntapestry and glass windows, and was imitated by one Marco, a painter,\r\nwho lived in the year 1335.[178] It may also be observed, that such\r\nwindows over the altars supplied the place of sacred paintings in\r\nchurches; Christian congregations, in lifting up their eyes, there\r\nsought the resemblance of what \"they hoped some time to behold in the\r\ncelestial paradise: che ancor lassu nel ciel vedere spera,\" and they\r\noften addressed their supplications to those images. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury Lorenzo Ghiberti, a man eminent in various arts, still further\r\nimproved this, and ornamented the oval windows of the facade of the\r\nchurch of S. Francis, and of the cathedral of Florence with coloured\r\nglass. In a similar manner he finished all the oval apertures in the\r\ncupola of the cathedral, except that of the Assumption, executed by\r\nDonatello. The glass was manufactured at Florence, for which purpose one\r\nDomenico Livi, a native of Gambassi, in the principality of Volterra,\r\nwho had learnt and practised the art at Lubec, was invited to that\r\nplace, as is proved by Baldinucci in his correction of Vasari.[179] From\r\nthis school apparently came Goro, and Bernardo di Francesco, with that\r\ntrain of Ingesuati, whose workmanship, exhibited at S. Lorenzo and\r\nelsewhere, has been much commended by the Florentine historians. (See\r\nMoreni, part vi. p. 41.) This art afterwards flourished at Arezzo, where\r\nit was introduced by Parri Spinelli, a scholar of Ghiberti. About the\r\nsame time flourished in Perugia P. D. Francesco, a monk of Cassino, not\r\nmerely a painter in glass, but a master in that city; and some\r\nconjecture that Vannucci profited by his school, though a comparison of\r\ndates does not much favour such a supposition. This art also flourished\r\nin Venice, about 1473, where one window was executed after the design of\r\nBartolommeo Vivarini, in the church of S. John and S. Paul, and another\r\nwas erected at Murano; but the art of painting glass could not be\r\nunknown at this last place, where it originated.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that in process of time the Florentine and Venetian glass\r\nappeared to be not sufficiently transparent for such purposes; and that\r\na preference was given to that of France and of England, the clearness\r\nand transparency of which was better adapted for receiving the colours,\r\nwithout too much obscuring the light. It had this other advantage, that\r\nthe colours were burnt in the glass, in the manner described by Vasari,\r\ninstead of being laid on with gums or other vehicles; hence they had\r\ngreater brilliancy, and were more capable of resisting the injuries of\r\ntime. This was a Flemish, or rather a French invention, and the Italians\r\nunquestionably received it from France. Bramante invited from that\r\ncountry the two artists above mentioned, who, besides the windows of the\r\nVatican palace, that were wrought with colours burnt into the glass, and\r\ndestroyed in the sack of Rome, in the time of Clement VII. ornamented\r\ntwo in the church of S. Maria del Popolo, with those scriptural\r\nhistories that yet remain perfectly brilliant in colour, after the lapse\r\nof three centuries. Soon after this Claude died at Rome. William\r\nsurvived him many years, and from that time continued to reside in\r\nArezzo. He there was engaged in the service of the capital, where one of\r\nhis painted glass windows is preserved in the Capponi chapel, at the\r\nchurch of S. Felicita; and he taught the art to Pastorino of Siena, who\r\nexercised it very skilfully in the state saloon of the Vatican, after\r\nthe designs of Vaga, and in the cathedral of Siena. This artist is\r\nreckoned the best scholar of his master. Maso Porro, Michelagnolo\r\nUrbani, both natives of Cortona, and Batista Borro of Arezzo, were\r\ntrained in the same school, and were afterwards employed in Tuscany and\r\nelsewhere. In ornamenting the old palace, Vasari availed himself of the\r\nassistance of two Flemish artists, Walter and George, who wrought after\r\nhis designs. Celebrated equal to any artist is Valerio Profondavalle of\r\nLouvain, who settled at Milan after the middle of the sixteenth century,\r\na man of fertile invention, and a pleasing colourist in fresco painting,\r\nbut chiefly eminent in painting on glass, as we are informed by Lomazzo.\r\nOrlandi celebrates Gerardo Ornerio Frisio, and his windows executed\r\nabout 1575, in the church of S. Peter at Bologna. This art afterwards\r\ndeclined, when custom, the arbiter of arts, by excluding it from palaces\r\nand churches, caused it gradually to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnother method of painting on glass, or rather on crystal, was much in\r\nfashion in the last century, and was employed for ornamenting mirrors,\r\ncaskets, and other furniture of the chambers of the great. Maratta and\r\nhis contemporaries on crystal for such works in the same style that they\r\nemployed in painting on canvass; and above all Giordano, who taught it\r\nto several pupils. Among these, the best was Carlo Garofalo, who was\r\ninvited to the court of Charles II. of Spain, to practise this species\r\nof painting,[180] the era of which does not embrace a great number of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Although Vasari, Borghini, and Baldinucci, have also\r\ntreated of other schools, they have chiefly illustrated that of\r\nFlorence, with which they were best acquainted. To them succeeded the\r\nrespectable authors of the _Florentine Museum_, and of the _Series of\r\nthe most celebrated Painters_, containing choice anecdotes of those\r\nmasters, which are now republished, and accompanied by a print from the\r\nwork of each painter, in the _Etruria Pittrice_ of the learned Sig. Ab.\r\nLastri. Other anecdotes are to be found in the work of P. Richa _On the\r\nChurches of Florence_, and in Sig. Cambiagi's _Guide_ to that City. Pisa\r\ntoo, has its _Guide_ by the Cav. Titi; to which has succeeded the much\r\nlarger work of Sig. da Morrona, above noticed. Siena has one by Sig.\r\nPecci, Volterra another by Ab. Giachi, and Pescia and Valdinievole by\r\nthe Ab. Ansaldi. Sig. Francesco Bernardi, an excellent connoisseur in\r\nthe fine arts, prepared a guide to Lucca after Marchio; it remains\r\ninedited since his death, together with his anecdotes of the painters,\r\nsculptors, and architects of his native country.

Having afterwards fled from Rome,\r\nthrough dread of Julius II., he completed it in three months, in the\r\nyear 1506. Compare the Brief of Julius, in which he recals Michelangiolo\r\n(_Lett. Pitt._ tom. iii. p. 320), with the relation of Vasari (tom. vi.\r\nEd. Fiorent. p. 191). During the time that Michelangiolo laboured at\r\nthis work, \"he was unwilling to shew it to any person (p. 182); and when\r\nit was finished it was carried to the hall of the Pope,\" and was there\r\nstudied (p. 184).

This\r\nstory of the latter is probably a fable, and undoubtedly it is so of\r\nMichelangiolo. The crucifixions of this artist are often repeated,\r\nsometimes with a single figure, sometimes with our Lady and S. John; at\r\nother times with two Angels, who collect the blood. Bottari mentions\r\nseveral of these pictures in different galleries. To these we may add\r\nthe picture of the Caprara palace, and those in the possession of\r\nMonsignor Bonfigliuoli and of Sigg. Biancani in Bologna. Sig. Co.\r\nChiappini of Piacenza has a very good one, and there is another in the\r\nchurch of the college of Ravenna.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: A name given by the Italians to pictures of a dead Christ\r\non the knees of his mother.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: Bottari, in his _Notes_ to the Letter of Preziado, doubts\r\nwhether this supposed scholar of Michelangiolo be Galeazzo Alessi,\r\nremarking at the same time that this last was rather an architect than a\r\npainter. I am inclined to think that the Matteo in question may have\r\nbeen the foregoing Matteo da _Lecce_, or da Leccio, and that owing to\r\none of those errors, which Clerche in his \"Arte Critica,\" calls _ex\r\nauditu_, his name in Spain became D'Alessi, or D'Alessio, the letters\r\n_c_ and _s_ in many countries being made use of reciprocally. Besides,\r\nthis _Leccese_, of whom we write in the fourth volume, flourished in the\r\ntime of Vargas, went to Spain, affected the style of Michelangiolo, and\r\nnever settled himself in any place from his desire of seeing the world.\r\nMemoirs of him appear to have been collected in Spain, by Pacheco, who\r\nlived in 1635 (Conca, iii. 252), who in his account, at this distance of\r\ntime, must have been guided by vulgar report; a bad authority for names,\r\nparticularly those of foreigners, as was noticed in the Preface. That he\r\nshould further be called Roman instead of Italian, in a foreign country,\r\nand that he should there adopt the name of Perez, not having assumed any\r\nsurname in Rome, can scarcely appear strange to the reader, and the more\r\nso as he is described as an adventurer--a species of persons who subsist\r\nupon tricks and frauds.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: Sebastiano painted it again for the Osservanti of\r\nViterbo; and there is a similar one described in the Carthusian\r\nMonastery, at Naples, which is painted in oil, and is supposed to be the\r\nwork of Bonarruoti.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Limbo, among theologians of the Roman Church, is the\r\nplace where the souls of just men, who died before the coming of our\r\nSaviour, and of unbaptized children, are supposed to reside.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: This noble fresco was ruined during the revolutionary\r\ntumults at Rome.--Tr.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: That Raffaello was at this time well versed in\r\nperspective it is unreasonable to doubt, as Bottari has done: he\r\nproceeded from the school of Perugino, who was very eminent in that\r\nscience; and he left a good specimen at Siena, where he remained some\r\ntime before he came to Florence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: Vol. iii. p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: This is conspicuous in a S.

Ab. Conca, (tom. i. p. 90,) belonging to the Royal Palace at\r\nMadrid. In the Ducal Palace of Alva, there are also galleries of\r\ngrotesques, where we read the name of Tommaso Fiorentino, the author, to\r\nwhich is added (tom. ii. p. 362) \"The name of this professor of the art\r\nis quite new to me; in his grotesques we meet with the exact style of\r\nthe sons of Bergamasco, &c.\" I hardly know how the name can appear new\r\nto the Ab. Conca, when he had already mentioned it elsewhere; nor how\r\nthe composition of an artist, who painted in 1521, could resemble that\r\nof others who were still young in the year 1570, in which their father\r\ndied.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Vasari, in his Life of Morto, says, that he came to\r\nFlorence in order to improve his skill in figures, in which he was\r\ndeficient, by studying the models of Vinci and of Michelangiolo. In\r\ndespair, however, he returned to his grotesques. Now I shall elsewhere\r\nproduce an unedited document shewing his ability in figure painting,\r\nwhich I should not have occasion to do if the beautiful portrait of\r\nMorto, in the Royal Gallery at Florence, was, as is conjectured, by his\r\nhand. But I am inclined to think that it is the likeness of an unknown\r\nperson, who, as I have seen in other portraits, caused himself to be\r\ndrawn with a finger pointing to a death's head, in order to remind him\r\nof his mortality, but in this picture the head has been capriciously\r\ninterpreted as a symbol of the name of Morto, and the painting given as\r\nthe portrait and work of Feltrese; of whom Vasari gives a very different\r\none.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: They wrought from the designs of Pontormo, and still more\r\nthose of Bronzino. They also wrought for the Duke of Ferrara after the\r\ndesigns of Giulio Romano, published by Gio. Battista Mantuano, among his\r\nprints.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: A similar composition is to be seen in an altar-piece in\r\nthe cathedral of Volterra. It is inscribed, _Opus Leonardi Pistoriens.\r\nan. 1516_. This, however, ought not to be passed over on account of an\r\nhistorical doubt started by the Cavalier Tolomei, whether there\r\nflourished, at the same period, two Lionardi da Pistoja; thus\r\ninsinuating they were of different families. And this would appear to be\r\nthe case. The painter of the piece in Volterra was not Grazia, at\r\nNaples, probably, surnamed Guelfo; since his master Penni, if we are to\r\nbelieve Vasari, was in that year, 1516, still the scholar and assistant\r\nof Raffaello; nor does it seem probable that he educated a pupil of so\r\nmuch merit. The Leonardo, therefore, who painted in Volterra, must have\r\nbeen some other of more proficiency.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: \"Hic invenies quidquid diversorum colorum generibus et\r\nmixturis habet Graecia ... quidquid in fenestrarum varietate pretiosa\r\ndiligit Francia.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: Zanetti, Nuova Raccolta delle Monete e Zecche d'Italia,\r\n(tom. iv. p. 158).

They had only to\r\nselect the best specimens from the works of native artists; as, for\r\ninstance, grandeur from Michelangiolo, grace from Andrea, and spirit\r\nfrom Rossi; they could learn colouring and casting of draperies from\r\nPorta, and chiaroscuro from Vinci. They appear, however, to have\r\nassiduously applied to design, but to have paid little attention to the\r\nother branches of painting. Even in that branch they imagined that every\r\nthing was to be found in Bonarruoti; and imitated him alone. Their\r\nchoice was influenced by the celebrity,[181] the success, and very long\r\nlife of this artist, who, having survived all his eminent\r\nfellow citizens, naturally recommended to employment the followers of\r\nhis maxims, and the adherents of his manner; hence it has been observed\r\nby some, that Raffaello lived too short a time for the progress of the\r\nfine arts, Michelangiolo too long. But artists ought to keep in mind the\r\nopinion, or rather prophecy of Bonarruoti--that his style would be\r\nproductive of inept artists, which has invariably been the character of\r\nthose who have imitated him without judgment.\r\n\r\nTheir study and constant practice has been to design from his statues:\r\nfor the cartoon on which so many eminent men formed their style, had\r\nalready perished; and his paintings were not to be seen in Florence but\r\nin Rome. They transferred into their compositions that statue-like\r\nrigidity, that strength of limb, and those markings of the origin and\r\ninsertion of muscles, that severity of countenance, and those positions\r\nof the hands and figures, which characterized his sublimely awful style;\r\nbut without comprehending the principles of this extraordinary man,\r\nwithout thoroughly understanding the play of the softer parts of the\r\nhuman figure, either by inserting them in wrong situations, or by\r\nrepresenting, in the same manner, those in action and at rest; those of\r\na slender stripling, and of the full-grown man. Contented with what they\r\nimagined grandeur of style, they neglected all the rest. In some of\r\ntheir pictures we may observe a multitude of figures arranged one above\r\nthe other, with a total disregard of their relative situations; features\r\nthat express no passion, and half naked figures that do nothing, except\r\npompously exhibit, like the Entellus of Virgil, _magna ossa\r\nlacertosque_. Instead of the beautiful azure and green formerly\r\nemployed, they substituted a languid yellowish hue; the full body of\r\ncolour gave place to superficial tints; and, above all, the bold relief,\r\nso much studied till the time of Andrea, went wholly into disuse.\r\n\r\nIn several passages Baldinucci confesses this decline, which, however,\r\nscarcely extended to two or three generations, and seems to have\r\ncommenced about 1540. During this unfortunate era the Florentines did\r\nnot degenerate as much as some other schools. The churches are full of\r\npictures of this era, which, if they are not to be admired like those of\r\nthe preceding, are, at least, respectable. Whoever sees the church of S.\r\nCroce, S. Maria Novella, and other places, where the best artists of\r\nthis era painted, will undoubtedly find more to praise than to condemn.\r\nFew of them were eminent as colourists, but many in design; few were\r\nentirely free from the mannerism above noticed; many, however, by\r\nprogressive improvement, at length attained gracefulness. We shall\r\nproceed to consider them, chiefly following the steps of Vincenzio\r\nBorghini, their contemporary; the author of _Il Reposo_, a dialogue\r\nworthy of perusal, both for the matter and the style. We shall commence\r\nwith Vasari, who not only belongs to this epoch, but has ever been\r\ncharged with being one of the chief authors of the decline of the\r\nart.[182]\r\n\r\nGiorgio Vasari, of Arezzo, was descended from a family attached to the\r\nfine arts; being the great grandson of Lazzaro, who was the intimate\r\nfriend of Pietro della Francesca, and the imitator of his paintings; the\r\nnephew of another Giorgio, who, in modelling vases in plaster, revived\r\nthe forms of the antique, in their basso-relievos, and their brilliant\r\ncolours; specimens of whose art exist in the royal gallery at Florence.\r\nMichelangiolo, Andrea, and some other masters, instructed him in design;\r\nGuglielmo da Marcilla, called the Prior, and Rosso, initiated him in\r\npainting: but he chiefly studied at Rome, whither he was brought by\r\nIppolito, Cardinal de' Medici, the person to whom he owed his success;\r\nfor by his means Giorgio was introduced to this family that loaded him\r\nwith riches and with honour. After having designed all the works of his\r\nfirst master, and of Raffaello, at Rome, and likewise much after other\r\nschools and antique marbles, he formed a style in which we may recognise\r\ntraces of his studies; but his predilection for Bonarruoti is apparent.\r\nAfter acquiring skill in painting figures, he became one of the most\r\nexcellent architects of the age; and united in himself the various\r\nbranches which were known to Perino, Giulio, and their scholars, who\r\nfollowed the example of Raffaello. He could unaided direct the\r\nconstruction of a grand fabric, adorn it with figures, with grotesques,\r\nwith landscapes, with stuccos, with gilding, and whatever else was\r\nrequired to ornament it in a princely style. By this means he began to\r\nbe known in Italy; and was employed as a painter in several places, and\r\neven in Rome. He was much employed in the hermitage of the Camaldules,\r\nand in several monasteries of the Olivets. In their monastery at Rimino\r\nhe executed a picture of the Magi, and various frescos for the church;\r\nin that at Bologna three pieces from sacred history, with some ornaments\r\nin the refectory; but still more in that at Naples, where he not only\r\nreduced the refectory to the rules of true architecture, but splendidly\r\nadorned it with stuccos and pictures of every description. Assisted by\r\nmany young men he spent a year in this work; and, as he himself says,\r\nwas the first who gave an idea of the modern style to that city. Some of\r\nhis pictures are to be seen in the Classe di Ravenna, in the church of\r\nS. Peter at Perugia, at Bosco, near Alessandria, in Venice, at Pisa, in\r\nFlorence, and at Rome, where the largest part of them are in various\r\nplaces of the Vatican, and in the hall of the Chancery. These pictures\r\nare historical frescos of the life of Paul III. undertaken at the desire\r\nof Cardinal Farnese; with whom originated the idea of writing the lives\r\nof the painters, afterwards published at Florence. Brought into notice\r\nby these works, honoured by the esteem and friendship of Bonarruoti, and\r\nrecommended by his multifarious abilities, he was invited to the court\r\nof Cosmo I. He went there with his family in 1553; at which time the\r\nartists above alluded to were either dead or very old, and, therefore,\r\nhe had little to fear from competitors. He superintended the magnificent\r\nworks executed by that prince; among which it would be wrong not to\r\ndistinguish the edifice for the public offices, which is esteemed among\r\nthe finest in Italy; and the old palace, with its several sub-divisions,\r\nwhich were all painted and decorated by Vasari and his pupils for the\r\nuse of government. In one part of it, each chamber bears the name of\r\nsome distinguished member of the family, and represents his exploits.\r\nThis is one of his best works; and here the chamber of Clement VII. is\r\nchiefly conspicuous, on the ceiling of which he represented the Pontiff\r\nin the act of crowning Charles V., and all around disposed the emblems\r\nof his virtues, his victories, and his most remarkable exploits. In this\r\nwork the magnificence of the prince is rivalled by the judgment and\r\ntaste of the artist. The reader may find notices of his other works,\r\nwhich are either in churches or in private houses, and of his temporary\r\ndecorations for funerals or festivals, by consulting his life written by\r\nhimself down to 1567, and the continuation of it to 1574, the year of\r\nGiorgio's decease.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us to discuss the merits of this artist, who has been\r\npraised by some and condemned by other authors that have treated of the\r\nfine arts, especially in Italy. I shall consider him first as a painter,\r\nand next as a writer. Had all his works perished but some of those in\r\nthe old palace, the Conception, in S. Apostolo at Florence, which\r\nBorghini commends as his finest production, the Decollation of S. John,\r\nin the church of the Baptist at Rome, which is adorned by exquisite\r\nperspective, the Feast of Ahasuerus, in the possession of the\r\nBenedictines at Arezzo, some of his portraits, which Bottari scruples\r\nnot to compare with those of Giorgione, and some of his other pictures\r\nthat demonstrate his ability, his reputation would have been much\r\ngreater than it is. But he aimed at too much; and for the most part\r\npreferred expedition to accuracy. Hence, though a good designer, his\r\nfigures are not always correct; and his painting often appears languid,\r\nfrom his meagre and superficial colouring.[183] The habit of careless\r\nexecution is usually the companion of some maxim that may serve to\r\nexcuse it to others, as well as to our own self-love: Vasari has\r\nrecommended in his writings the acquirement of compendious methods,[184]\r\nand \"the expedition of practice;\" in other words, to make use of former\r\nexercises and studies in painting. This method is highly advantageous to\r\nthe artist, because it increases his profits; but is prejudicial to the\r\nart, which thus degenerates into mannerism, or, in other words, departs\r\nfrom nature: Vasari fell into this error in many of his works,\r\nespecially in his hasty productions, or where he borrowed the hand of\r\nothers; apologies which he frequently offers to the readers of his\r\n\"Lives.\" He was principally induced, I believe, to offer such apologies\r\nfor his practice, from the strictures on his paintings contained in the\r\nhall of the Chancery, which were finished in a hundred days, according\r\nto their author, in order to please the cardinal: but he ought then\r\nrather to have excused himself to Farnese, and to have requested him to\r\nemploy some other artist, than to make his apology to posterity, and to\r\nintreat us to excuse his faults. He ought to have listened to the\r\nadmonitions of his friends; among whom Caro did not fail to remind him\r\nof the injury his reputation might sustain by such hasty\r\nproductions.[185] As he long superintended the decorations of the\r\ncapital, ordered by Cosmo I. and Prince D. Francesco, and was assisted\r\nin them by many young men, Baldinucci affirms that he chiefly\r\ncontributed to that dry manner which prevailed in Florence.[186]\r\n\r\nThis opinion is probably not erroneous; for the example of a painter\r\nemployed by the court was sufficient to seduce the rising generation\r\nfrom pristine diligence, to a more careless manner. After all, the\r\nFlorentines who assisted him were chiefly the scholars of Bronzino, and,\r\nexcept two or three, they did not adopt the style of Vasari: some others\r\nalso may have done so for a little time. Francesco Morandini, called\r\nPoppi, from his native place, was his disciple and imitator; and in his\r\npicture of the Conception, at S. Michelino, in the superior one of the\r\nVisitation, at S. Nicholas, and in his many other works, he appears a\r\nfollower of Giorgio; except that he was more minute, and attended more\r\nto gay and cheerful composition. Giovanni Stradano Fiammingo, for ten\r\nyears a dependant of Vasari, adopted his colouring, but imitated the\r\ndesign of Salviati; with whom and also with Daniele di Volterra he had\r\nlived in Rome. There is a Christ on the Cross, by him, at the Serviti,\r\nwhich is preferred to any other he painted at Florence, where he\r\nexecuted many designs for tapestry, and many prints. He had a fertile\r\ninvention; he is praised by Vasari as highly as any other artist then in\r\nthe service of the court, and is considered by Borghini among the\r\neminent masters. Vasari after him retained Jacopo Zucchi, whose works\r\nexhibit none of the carelessness of Giorgio. He sometimes imitated him;\r\nbut his style is better and more refined. He lived long at Rome, under\r\nthe protection of Ferdinando, Cardinal de' Medici, in whose house, and\r\nmore especially in the Rucellai palace, he painted in fresco with\r\nincredible diligence. His picture of the Birth of the Baptist, in S.\r\nGiovanni Decollato, is esteemed the best in that church; and in this\r\npiece he appears more a follower of Andrea, than of any other master. He\r\nusually introduced real portraits of distinguished characters and men of\r\nletters in his compositions, and he shewed a peculiar grace in the\r\nfigures of children and of young people. Baglioni praises both this\r\nartist and his brother Francesco, who was a good artist in mosaic, and\r\nan excellent painter of fruit and flowers.\r\n\r\nIn considering Giorgio as a writer, I shall not consume much time;\r\nhaving so frequently to notice him in the course of my work. He wrote\r\nprecepts of art and lives of the painters, as is well known; and he\r\nadded to them some dissertations on his own occupations,[187] and his\r\npictures.[188] He entered on this work at the instigation of Cardinal\r\nFarnese, as well as of Monsig. Giovio; and he was encouraged in it by\r\nCaro, Molza, Tolomei, and other literary men belonging to that court.\r\nHis first intention was to collect anecdotes of artists, to be extended\r\nby Giovio. They wished him to commence with Cimabue; with which,\r\nperhaps, he ought not to have complied; but this circumstance diminishes\r\nthe fault of Vasari in passing over the older masters in silence, and\r\nraises the glory of Cimabue far above all his contemporaries. When it\r\nwas discovered that Vasari could write well,[189] and was capable of\r\nextending the anecdotes in even more appropriate language than Giovio\r\nhimself, the whole task devolved on him; but in order to render the work\r\nmore worthy of the public, he had the assistance afforded him of men of\r\nletters. In 1547, on finishing the book, he went to Rimino; and whilst\r\nhe was employed in painting for the fraternity of Olivets, Father D.\r\nGio. Matteo Faetani, abbot of the monastery, corrected his work and\r\ncaused it to be wholly transcribed; about the end of that year it was\r\nsent to Caro for perusal. He signified his approbation of it, \"as\r\nwritten in a fine style, and with great care;\"[190] except that in some\r\npassages a less artificial style was desirable. After being corrected in\r\nthis respect, it was printed in two volumes by Torrentino, at Florence,\r\nin the year 1550; in this edition he received considerable aid from\r\nFather D. Miniato Pitti, then an Olivetine friar.[191] Vasari complained\r\nthat \"many things were there inserted he knew not how, and were altered\r\nwithout his knowledge or consent;\"[192] but I cannot agree with\r\nBottari,[193] that these alterations were made by Pitti or any other\r\nmonk. If Vasari could not discover their author, we are much less likely\r\nto find him out; and there is some ground for believing that Vasari had\r\noffended many persons by certain invidious anecdotes, and thus\r\nendeavoured to excuse himself as well as he could. Who can believe that\r\nthe many things cancelled in the second edition, which seems almost a\r\nnew work, were all liberties taken by other persons, \"he did not know\r\nhow\" and not mistakes, at least for the most part, made by himself?\r\n\r\nIn whatever way it happened, he had an opportunity of correcting his\r\nlives, of augmenting them, and again printing them, accompanied by\r\nportraits of the artists. After publication of the first edition he had\r\navailed himself of the manuscripts of Ghiberti, of Domenico Ghirlandaio,\r\nof Raffaello d'Urbino; and had himself collected a number of anecdotes\r\nin his different journeys through Italy. He undertook a new tour in\r\n1566, to prepare for the new edition, as he informs us in the life of\r\nBenvenuto Garofolo; he again examined the works of different masters,\r\nand obtained new information from his friends, some of whom he mentions\r\nby name, when treating of the artists of Forli and Verona. He would have\r\nbeen still more full of anecdote in his Lives, had his success\r\ncorresponded with his diligence. On this account, in the beginning and\r\nat the end of the Life of Carpaccio, he laments that \"he was not able to\r\nobtain every particular of many artists;\" nor to possess their\r\nportraits; and he \"entreats us to accept what he is able to offer,\r\nalthough he cannot give all he might desire.\" He republished his Lives\r\nin 1568, and affirmed in the Dedication to Cosmo I. that \"as for himself\r\nhe wished for nothing more in them.\" The new edition issued from the\r\npress of the Giunti; of the additions, consisting of fine observations\r\nupon philosophy and Christian morality, which cannot be ascribed to\r\nGiorgio, part was supplied by Borghini, and still more by Father D.\r\nSilvano Razzi, a Camalduline monk, as Bottari conjectures in his\r\nPreface,[194] but it does not follow that they assisted in correcting\r\nthe work. It is full of errors; sometimes in the grammatical\r\nconstruction, often in the names, and frequently in the dates; and\r\nthough it was reprinted at Bologna, in 1648; at Rome, with the notes and\r\ncorrections of Bottari, in 1759; in Leghorn and Florence, in 1767, with\r\nfresh notes and additions by the same; and lastly, in Siena, with those\r\nof P. della Valle; it still remains not so much a judicious selection of\r\nfacts, as a mass of chronological emendations, some of which shall be\r\nnoticed in the sequel.[195]\r\n\r\nThis, if I am not deceived, is the objection that can be most\r\nfrequently, and almost continually urged against the work. The other\r\nstrictures to be met with in authors are, for the most part,\r\nexaggerations of writers, offended at Vasari for his silence or his\r\ncriticisms, on the works of the artists of their country. There is\r\nnothing so flattering to the vanity of an author, as defending the\r\ncharacter of his native place, and of those citizens who have rendered\r\nher illustrious. In whatever manner he writes, all his countrymen, who\r\nare all the world to him, think him in the right; and in the\r\ncoffeehouses he frequents, in the shops of the booksellers, and in all\r\npublic places, they hail him as the public advocate. Hence we need not\r\nbe surprised that such an author writes as if his country had appointed\r\nhim her champion, assumes a spirit of hostility, and then the transition\r\nis easy from a just defence to an injurious attack. From such causes\r\nsome writers appear to me actuated by unbecoming enmity to Vasari. The\r\npassages of the first edition, cancelled in the second, have been quoted\r\nagainst him; he has incurred odium for some deformed portraits, as if he\r\nwas accountable for the defects of nature; his most innocent expressions\r\nhave been tortured into a sinister meaning; his enemies would have us\r\nbelieve that, intending to exalt his darling Florentines, he neglected\r\nthe other Italian artists, as if, in order to do justice to these, he\r\nhad not travelled and sought for information, although often in vain, as\r\nI before mentioned. The historians of all the other schools have used\r\nhim as the commentators of Virgil treated Servius; all have abused him,\r\nand all have availed themselves of his labours. For if all the\r\ninformation collected by Vasari concerning the old masters of the\r\nVenetian, Bolognese, and Lombard schools be taken away, how imperfect\r\ndoes their history remain? In my opinion, therefore, he deserves our\r\nbest thanks for what he has done, and much forbearance for what he has\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\nIf his judgment appears less accurate on some artists of a different\r\nschool, he ought not, on that account, to be taxed with malignity and\r\nenvy, as is well observed by Lomazzo. He has protested that he has done\r\nhis best to adhere to truth, or to what he believed to be true,[196] and\r\nit is sufficient to read him without prejudice to give him credit for\r\nsuch justification. He seems a man who writes as he thinks. Thus, he\r\nbestows commendations upon Baldinelli and upon Zuccaro, his\r\nenemies,[197] as well as upon his friends: he distributes censure and\r\npraise with an equal hand to Tuscan and other artists. If he discovers\r\npainters of little merit in other schools, he finds them also in that of\r\nFlorence; if he relates the jealousies of foreign artists, he does not\r\nconceal those of the Florentines, of which he speaks with a playful\r\nfreedom in the Life of Donatello, in his own, and more especially in\r\nthat of Pietro Perugino. His partial criticisms therefore on certain\r\nartists arose less from his nationality, than from other causes. It is\r\ncertain that he saw but little of some masters; his opinion of others\r\nwas formed upon incorrect information; and he could not attain the same\r\ncertainty that we now boast, on what related to a number of artists then\r\nliving, who, as usually happens, were then more censured than admired.\r\nSome allowance too should be made for his other avocations; by the\r\nmultiplicity of which he doubtless wrote as he painted, with the\r\nexpedition of his mode of practice. A proof of this is afforded by the\r\nrepetitions that occur, as we have before observed, in successive\r\npassages, and the contradictory characters he sometimes gives of the\r\nsame picture, pronouncing it good in one sentence, and in another\r\nallowing it scarcely the praise of mediocrity. This was particularly the\r\ncase in regard to Razzi, towards whom he seems to have entertained ill\r\nwill; arising, however, more from the bad reputation of the man than\r\nfrom prejudice against the school of the artist. For the incorrectness\r\nof such censures, in which he, however, was sincere, I blame his maxims\r\nof art, and the age in which he lived. He reckoned Bonarruoti the\r\ngreatest painter that had ever existed;[198] and exalted him above the\r\nancient Greeks,[199] and, from his practice, held a bold and vigorous\r\ndesign as the summit of perfection in painting; compared to which,\r\nbeauty and colouring were nothing.[200] From such fundamental principles\r\nproceeded some of his obnoxious criticisms on Bassano, Tiziano, and on\r\nRaffaello himself. But is this the effect of his malignity, or of his\r\neducation? Does it not happen in philosophy as in painting, that every\r\none gives a decided preference to those of his own sect. Has not\r\nPetrarca generalized the observation, when he asks,\r\n\r\n                  ----\"Or che e questo\r\n  Che ognun del suo saper par che si appaghi?\"\r\n\r\nWe may, then, forgive in Vasari what appeared to this philosophic poet a\r\nweakness of human nature; and may observe on a few passages in his work\r\nwhat was applied to Tacitus; that we condemn his principles, but admire\r\nhis history. Such, I believe, was the opinion of Lomazzo, who though not\r\nwholly satisfied with the opinions of Vasari, not only excused but\r\ndefended him;[201] and in this he acted properly.\r\n\r\nVasari is, moreover, the father of the history of painting, and has\r\ntransmitted to us its most precious materials. Educated in the most\r\nauspicious era of the art, he has in some measure perpetuated the\r\ninfluence of the golden age. In perusing his Lives, I fancy myself\r\nlistening to the individuals of whom he has collected the traditions and\r\nthe precepts. It was thus, think I, that Raffaello and Andrea imparted\r\nthese facts to their scholars; thus spoke Bonarruoti; the friends of\r\nGiorgio heard this from Vinci and Porta, and in this manner must have\r\nrelated it to him. I am delighted with the facts, and also with the\r\nluminous, simple, and natural manner in which they are expressed,\r\ninterwoven with the technical terms that originated in Florence, and\r\nworthy of every writer whose subject is the fine arts. Finally, should I\r\ndiscover in him any prejudice of education, or, if you will, arising\r\nfrom self-love, it seems to me unjust on account of such a fault, to\r\nforget his many services, and to declare hostilities against him for\r\nsuch blemishes.\r\n\r\nAnother service Vasari conferred on the fine arts yet remains to be\r\nnoticed, and that is the establishment of the Academy of Design in\r\nFlorence, about the year 1561, principally through his exertions. The\r\nsociety of S. Luke there existed from the fourteenth century, but it had\r\nfallen into decay, and was almost extinct, when F. Gio. Angiolo\r\nMontorsoli Servita, a celebrated statuary, conceived the design of\r\nreviving it. He communicated his idea to Giorgio, who so effectually\r\nrecommended it to Cosmo I., that, shortly after, it arose with new\r\nvigour, and became at the same time a charitable institution and an\r\nacademy of the fine arts. The prince wished to be considered its head,\r\nand D. Vincenzio Borghini was appointed his representative in\r\ntransacting his ordinary business, which situation was afterwards filled\r\nby Cav. Gaddi, by Baccio Valori, and successively by some of the most\r\naccomplished gentlemen of the city; an arrangement maintained by the\r\nsovereigns down to the present day. The chapter house of the Nunziata,\r\n\"decorated with the sculpture and pictures of the best masters\" of the\r\nage, was granted to this college of artists for a hall, as we are\r\ninformed by Valori.[202] Another place was assigned for their meetings,\r\nand they have frequently experienced the liberality of succeeding\r\nprinces. Their rules were drawn up by the restorers of this institution,\r\nof whom Vasari was one. He wrote concerning it to Michelangiolo,[203]\r\nand asserted that every member of this academy \"was indebted to him for\r\nwhat he knew;\" and indeed this academy in all its branches partakes\r\nstrongly of his style. A similar doctrine, as we have observed, already\r\nprevailed at Florence; but it would have been better that every one\r\nfollowed the master whom his genius pointed out. In the choice of a\r\nstyle nature ought to direct, not to follow; every one should make his\r\nelection according to his talents. It is true that the error of the\r\nFlorentines is common to other nations; and has given rise to an\r\nopinion, that academies have had a baneful influence on the arts; since\r\nthey have only tended to constrain all to follow the same path; and\r\nhence Italy is found fruitful in adherents to systems, but barren in\r\ntrue painters. To me the institution of academies has always appeared\r\nhighly useful, when conducted on the plan of that of the Caracci, of\r\nwhich we shall treat under their school. In the mean time I return to\r\nthe Florentine school.\r\n\r\nThe contemporaries of Vasari were Salviati and Jacopo del Conte, both of\r\nwhom lived also with Andrea del Sarto, and Bronzino, the scholar of\r\nPontormo. Like Giorgio, their genius led them to an imitation of\r\nMichelangiolo. Francesco de' Rossi, called Salviati, from the surname of\r\nhis patron, was the fellow student of Vasari, under Andrea del Sarto and\r\nBaccio Bandinelli. The last mentioned artist was an excellent sculptor,\r\nwho usually taught design to students in painting, an art which, like\r\nVerrocchio, he sometimes practised for amusement. While at Rome,\r\nSalviati, contracting an intimate friendship with Giorgio, pursued the\r\nsame studies, and adopted the same fundamental principles of the art. He\r\nfinally became a painter more correct, more elevated, and more spirited\r\nthan his companion, and Vasari classes him among the best artists then\r\nin Rome. There he was employed in the palace of his patron, in the\r\nFarnese and Riccio palaces, in the Chancery, in the church of S. Gio.\r\nDecollato, and in various other places, where he filled extensive walls\r\nwith historical frescos, an employment which was his chief delight. His\r\ninvention was very fertile, his compositions varied, his architecture\r\ngrand; he is one of the few who have united celerity of execution with\r\nscientific design, in which he was deeply versed, although occasionally\r\nsomewhat extravagant. His best production now in Florence is the battle\r\nand triumph of Furius Camillus, in the saloon of the old palace, a work\r\nfull of spirit, that appears from the representations of armour,\r\ndraperies, and Roman customs, conducted by an able antiquary. There is\r\nalso in the church of Santa Croce, a Descent from the Cross; to him a\r\nfamiliar subject, which he repeated at the Panfili palace at Rome, and\r\nin the _Corpus Domini_ at Venice; and it may be seen in some private\r\ncollections, in which his Holy Families and portraits are not rare. The\r\noctagonal picture of Psyche, in the possession of the Grimani family, is\r\nhighly celebrated, and Giorgio pronounces it the \"finest picture in all\r\nVenice.\" His remark would have been less invidious, had he said it was\r\nthe most scientific in design; but who can concede to him that it\r\nappeared a paragon in that city? The features of Psyche have nothing\r\nuncommon; and the whole, though well composed, and adorned with a\r\nbeautiful landscape, and an elegant little temple, cannot be compared to\r\nthe charming compositions of Tiziano, or of Paolo Veronese, in which we\r\nsometimes behold, as Dante would express it, \"the whole creation smile.\"\r\nThe design of Salviati was better than his colouring; and on this\r\naccount he did not meet with success at Venice; on his going to France\r\nhe was but little employed, and is now less sought after and esteemed\r\nthan Tiziano or Paolo. In ornamental arts such as poetry and painting,\r\nit would seem that mankind are more easily contented with a mediocrity\r\nin knowledge, than with mediocrity in the art of pleasing. It was very\r\ncorrectly observed by Salvator Rosa, when requested to give his opinion\r\nupon the relative merits of design and colouring, that he had been able\r\nto meet with many Santi di Tito in the shops of the suburbs, at a very\r\nlow price, but that he had never seen there a single specimen of\r\nBassano. Salviati was the best artist of this epoch, and if he was\r\nlittle employed at Florence, according to Vasari, it arose partly from\r\nthe envy of malevolent persons, partly from his own turbulent, restless,\r\nand haughty demeanour. He trained up, however, some artists who belong\r\nto this school. Francesco del Prato, an eminent goldsmith, and an\r\nexcellent artist in the inlaying of metals, when advanced in life,\r\nimbibed the love of painting from Salviati, and became his pupil. Having\r\na good idea of design, he was soon able to execute cabinet pictures; two\r\nof which, the Plague of Serpents and the Limbo, are pronounced most\r\nbeautiful by Vasari. It is not improbable that some of the minor\r\npictures ascribed to Salviati may be the work of this artist, who is as\r\nlittle named as if he had never existed. Bernardo Buontalenti, a man of\r\nrare and universal genius, was instructed in miniature painting by\r\nClovio, and had Salviati, Vasari, and Bronzino, for his masters in the\r\nother branches of painting. He was so successful that his works were in\r\nrequest by Francis I., by the emperor, and the king of Spain. His\r\nportrait is in the royal gallery, besides which little in Florence can\r\nbe ascribed to him with certainty, for he dedicated his time chiefly to\r\narchitecture and to hydrostatics. Ruviale Spagnuolo, Domenico Romano,\r\nand Porta della Garfagnana, belong to the school of Salviati. We shall\r\nnotice the last among the Venetians, among whom he lived. In the\r\ntreatise of Lomazzo, Romolo Fiorentino is assigned to the same school;\r\nthe individual conjectured by P. Orlandi to be the Romolo Cincinnato, a\r\nFlorentine painter, employed by Philip II. of Spain. He is very\r\nhonourably mentioned by Palomino, together with his sons and pupils,\r\nDiego and Francesco, both eminent artists favoured by Philip IV. and\r\nPope Urban VIII. by whom they were knighted.\r\n\r\nJacopino del Conte, who is also noticed in the _Abecedario Pittorico_,\r\nunder the name of Jacopo del Conte, and considered not as the same\r\nindividual, but as two distinct artists, was little employed in\r\nFlorence, but in great request in Rome. He was eminent as a\r\nportrait painter to all the Popes and the principal nobility of Rome,\r\nfrom the time of Paul III. to that of Clement VIII., in whose\r\npontificate he died. His ability in composition may be discovered in the\r\nfrescos in S. Gio. Decollato, and especially in the picture of the\r\nDeposition in that place, a work which is reckoned among his finest\r\nproductions. There the competition of his most distinguished countrymen\r\nstimulated his exertions for distinction. He was an imitator of\r\nMichelangiolo, but in a manner so free, and a colouring so different,\r\nthat it seems the production of another school. Scipione Gaetano, whom\r\nwe shall consider in the third book of our history, was his scholar. Of\r\nDomenico Beceri, a respectable pupil of Puligo, and of some others of\r\nlittle note, I have nothing further to add.\r\n\r\nAngiolo Bronzino was another friend of Vasari, nearly of the same age,\r\nand was enumerated among the more eminent artists, from the grace of his\r\ncountenances, and the agreeableness of his compositions. He is likewise\r\nesteemed as a poet. His poems were printed along with those of Berni;\r\nand some of his letters on painting are preserved in the collection of\r\nBottari.[204] Although the scholar and follower of Pontormo, he also\r\nrecals Michelangiolo to our recollection. His frescos in the old palace\r\nare praised, adorning a chapel, on the walls of which he represented the\r\nFall of Manna, and the Scourge of the Serpents, histories full of power\r\nand spirit; although the paintings on the ceiling do not correspond with\r\nthem, being deficient in the line of perspective. Some of his\r\naltar-pieces are to be seen in the churches of Florence, several of them\r\nfeebly executed, with figures of angels, whose beauty appears too soft\r\nand effeminate. There are many, on the other hand, extremely beautiful,\r\nsuch as his Pieta at S. Maria Nuova, and likewise his Limbo at Santa\r\nCroce, in an altar belonging to the noble family of Riccasoli. This\r\npicture is better suited for an academy of design, from the naked\r\nfigure, than for a church; but the painter was too much attached to\r\nMichelangiolo to avoid imitating him even in this error. This picture\r\nhas been lately very well repaired. Many of his portraits are in Italian\r\ncollections of paintings, which are praiseworthy for their truth and\r\nspirit; but their character is frequently diminished by the colour of\r\nthe flesh, which sometimes partakes of a leaden hue, at other times\r\nappears of a dead white, on which the red appears like rouge. But a\r\nyellowish tint is the predominant colour in his pictures, and his\r\ngreatest fault is a want of relief.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding artists, who are chiefly Florentines, are named by Vasari\r\nin the Obsequies of Bonarruoti, in the memoirs of the academicians,\r\nwritten about the year 1567, and in several other places. Their works\r\nare scattered over the city, and many of them are to be found in the\r\ncloister of S. Maria Novella. If these semicircular pictures had not\r\nbeen retouched and altered, this place would be, with regard to this\r\nepoch, what the cloister of the Olivetines in Bologna is to that of the\r\nCaracci; an era, indeed, more auspicious for the art, but not more\r\ninteresting in an historical point of view. Another collection, of which\r\nI have spoken in my description of the tenth cabinet of the royal\r\ngallery, is better preserved, and indeed is quite perfect. It now\r\noccupies another apartment. It consists of thirty-four fabulous and\r\nhistorical pictures, painted on the panels of a writing desk for Prince\r\nFrancesco,[205] by various artists of this epoch. Vasari, to whom the\r\nwork was entrusted, there represented Andromeda delivered by Perseus,\r\nand procured the assistance of the academicians, who thus emulated each\r\nother, and strove to recommend themselves to the court. Most of them\r\nhave put their names to their work;[206] and, if the defects common to\r\nthat age, or peculiar to the individual, are here and there visible in\r\nthe work, it demonstrates that the light of painting was not yet\r\nextinguished in Florence. Nevertheless, I advise him who examines this\r\ncollection, to suspend his judgment on the merits of those artists until\r\nhe has considered their other productions in their own country or at\r\nRome, where some of them have a place in the choicest collections. They\r\nmay be divided in several schools: we shall begin with that of Angiolo.\r\n\r\nAlessandro Allori, the nephew and pupil of Bronzino, whose surname he\r\nsometimes inscribed on his pictures, is reckoned inferior to his uncle.\r\nWholly intent upon anatomy, of which he gave fine examples in the\r\nTribune of the Servi, and on which he composed a treatise for the use of\r\npainters, he did not sufficiently attend to the other branches of the\r\nart. Some of his pictures in Rome, representing horses, are beautiful;\r\nand his sacrifice of Isaac, in the royal museum, is coloured almost in\r\nthe Flemish style. His power of expression is manifested by his picture\r\nof the Woman taken in Adultery in the church of the Holy Spirit. He was\r\nexpert in portrait painting; but he abused this talent by introducing\r\nportraits in the modern costume in ancient histories, a fault not\r\nuncommon in that age. On the whole his genius appears to have been equal\r\nto every branch of painting; but it was unequally exercised, and\r\nconsequently unequally expanded. He painted much for foreigners, and\r\nenjoyed the esteem of the ducal family, who employed him to finish the\r\npictures at Poggio a Caiano, begun by Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio,\r\nand Pontormo, and by them left more or less imperfect. Opposite to these\r\npictures he painted, from his own invention, the Gardens of the\r\nHesperides, the Feast of Syphax, and Titus Flaminius dissuading the\r\nEtolians from the Achaean league; all which historical subjects, as well\r\nas those of Caesar and Cicero, were chosen as symbols of similar events\r\nin the lives of Cosmo and Lorenzo de' Medici. Such was the manner of\r\nthinking in that age; and moderns personified in ancient heroes obtained\r\na less direct, but higher honour from the art. Giovanni Bizzelli, a\r\ndisciple of Alessandro, of middling talents, painted in S. Gio.\r\nDecollato, at Rome, and in some Florentine churches. Cristofano, a son\r\nof Alessandro, became eminent; but he is to be considered hereafter.\r\n\r\nSanti Titi, of Citta San Sepolcro, a scholar of Bronzino and Cellini,\r\nstudied long at Rome, whence he returned, with a style full of science\r\nand of grace. His beautiful is without much of the ideal; but his\r\ncountenances exhibit a certain fulness, an appearance of freshness and\r\nof health, that is surpassed by none of those who took nature for their\r\nmodel. Design was his characteristic excellence; and for this he was\r\ncommended by his imitator, Salvator Rosa. In expression he has few\r\nsuperiors in other schools, and none in his own. His ornaments are\r\njudicious; and having practised architecture with applause, he\r\nintroduced perspectives, that gave a dignity and charm to his\r\ncompositions. He is esteemed the best painter of this epoch, and belongs\r\nto it rather from the time in which he lived than his style; if we\r\nexcept his colouring, which was too feeble, and without much relief.\r\nBorghini, at once his critic and apologist, remarks that even in this\r\ndepartment he was not deficient, when he chose to exert himself; and he\r\nseems to have studied it in the Feast of Emmaus, in the church of the\r\nHoly Cross at Florence, in the Resurrection of Lazarus, in the cathedral\r\nof Volterra, and in a picture at Citta di Castello, in which he\r\nrepresents the faithful receiving the Holy Spirit from the hands of the\r\nApostles; a painting that may be viewed with pleasure, even after the\r\nthree by Raffaello which adorn that city.\r\n\r\nAmong his numerous pupils in design, we may reckon his son Tiberio; but\r\nthis artist attended less to the pursuits of his father, than to\r\npainting small portraits in vermilion, in which he had singular merit;\r\nthese were readily received into the collection formed by Cardinal\r\nLeopold, which now forms a single cabinet in the royal museum. Two other\r\nFlorentines are worthy of notice, viz. Agostino Ciampelli, who\r\nflourished in Rome under Clement VIII.; and Lodovico Buti, who remained\r\nat Florence. They resemble twins by the similarity between them; less\r\nscientific, less inventive, and less able in composition, than Titi,\r\nthey possessed fine ideas, were correct in design, and cheerful in their\r\ncolouring, beyond the usage of the Florentine school; but they were\r\nsomewhat crude, and at times profuse in the use of red tints not\r\nsufficiently harmonized. Frescos by the first may be seen in the\r\nSacristy at Rome, and the chapel of S. Andrea al Gesu, and an oil\r\npainting of the Crucifixion at S. Prassede, in his best manner. A\r\nVisitation, with its two companions, at S. Stephen of Pescia, may be\r\nreckoned among his choicest works; to which the vicinity of Tiarini does\r\nlittle injury. The second may be recognised by a picture of the miracle\r\nof the loaves and fishes, abounding in figures, which is in the royal\r\ngallery. Baccio Ciarpi, a pupil of the same school, is celebrated as the\r\nmaster of Berrettini, and deserves to be commended for his diligence and\r\ncorrectness. He was thought worthy of being employed at La Concezione at\r\nRome, a most splendid gallery, painted by the greatest artists of that\r\nage. A portrait of one Andrea Boscoli, his pupil and imitator, remains\r\nin the royal museum of Florence, and many of his paintings with horses\r\nare dispersed through the city. He travelled into different parts,\r\nleaving various specimens of his art in different countries, at S.\r\nGinesio, at Fabriano, and other places in the district of Piceno. His\r\nlargest work is a S. John the Baptist in the attitude of prayer, at the\r\nTeresiani of Rimino; a picture that shews invention, but it was unknown\r\nto Baldinucci, who compiled anecdotes of this artist. Constantino de'\r\nServi is conjectured by Baldinucci to be a scholar of Titi. He is well\r\nknown to have been originally his imitator, and having gone into\r\nGermany, there adopted the style of Pourbus. In foreign countries he\r\nseems to have painted few portraits, a branch in which he had greater\r\nmerit than employment. His celebrity was greater as a master architect\r\nand engraver of gems, as we shall notice in a subsequent epoch. In\r\nclosing the account of the school of Santi, it may be proper to observe,\r\nthat his example reclaimed a great proportion of the succeeding\r\ngeneration, and inclined artists to mitigate the severity of the style\r\nof Michelangiolo, by introducing more grace in the contours, and a\r\nbetter taste in the heads.\r\n\r\nBatista Naldini holds the third rank among the scholars of Bronzino. He\r\nwas first the pupil of Pontormo, afterwards of Bronzino, and having\r\nresided some time at Rome, he was chosen by Vasari as the companion of\r\nhis labours in the old palace, and retained by him about fourteen years.\r\nThe historian makes honourable mention of Naldini, even when a young\r\nman, and denominates him a painter skilful and vigorous, expeditious and\r\nindefatigable. Naldini obtained similar praise in Rome from Baglione,\r\nespecially for the chapel of John the Baptist, at Trinita de' Monti,\r\nwhich he painted with the history of the saint. He painted many pictures\r\nin his native city, some of which, as the taking down from the Cross,\r\nand the Purification of the Virgin, are commended by Borghini for the\r\ncolouring and the design, for the disposition, the perspective, and the\r\nattitudes. The defects observable in most of his pictures are, that the\r\nknees are rather too much swollen, the eyes too open, and marked with a\r\ncertain fierceness, by which he may be generally recognized; his\r\ncolouring is also characteristic, and those changeable hues in which he\r\ndelighted more than any other artist of the age.\r\n\r\nHe taught according to the method then pursued by most masters, which\r\nwas to employ his scholars in designing after the chalk drawings of\r\nMichelangiolo, and to give them his own finished pictures to copy; for,\r\nlike bees, artists were exceedingly anxious to work in secret, and ready\r\nto wound all who overlooked them. Baldinucci has recorded several\r\ninstances of this peculiarity. From these circumstances the fault of the\r\nscholars of Naldini was stiffness, the common failing of that age; they\r\nhad little of that free touch and taste in colouring which he possessed,\r\nbut yet they deserve to be recorded. Giovanni Balducci, called also\r\nCosci, from the surname of his maternal uncle, was long his assistant.\r\nHis Last Supper in the cathedral, the Finding of the Cross at the\r\nCrocetta, his historical compositions in the cloister of the Domecans at\r\nFlorence, and in S. Prassede at Rome, prove his genius to have been more\r\nrefined than that of his master. To second the latter, he now and then,\r\nperhaps, went beyond his province, and to some, his attitudes at times\r\nappear affected. He resided and died at Naples, and he is deservedly\r\npraised by the historians of that city. Cosimo Gamberucci appears to\r\nhave aimed at a totally different object. On examining a great part of\r\nhis works, we may say of him, as was observed of the ancient artist,\r\nthat he has not sacrificed to the Graces. He seems finally to have\r\nimproved, for he has left some fine pictures, worthy of the following\r\nepoch. Peter healing the lame in S. Pier Maggiore, a picture in the\r\nstyle of the Caracci, is the work of his hand. The Servitian monks have\r\na good picture by him in their public hall; and his holy families and\r\ncabinet pictures of a high class are to be met with in the city. The\r\nCav. Francesco Currado had a still better opportunity of improvement,\r\nfor he lived ninety-one years, constantly employed in painting and in\r\nteaching. One of his best pictures is on the altar of S. Saverio, in the\r\nchurch of S. Giovannino. He was very eminent in small figures, and in\r\nthis style he painted the history of the Magdalen, and especially the\r\nmartyrdom of S. Tecla, of the royal gallery, which are works of his best\r\ntime. In the same school we may include Valerio Marucelli, and Cosimo\r\nDaddi, both artists of some merit; the second is memorable for his\r\ncelebrated pupil Volterrano, in whose native place he married, and two\r\nof his altar-pieces still remain there.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Maria Butteri, and Lorenzo dello Sciorina, were two other\r\nscholars of Bronzino, and assisted Vasari in the above mentioned\r\npictures on the escrutoire, and in his preparations for festivals. The\r\nfirst imitated Vasari, his master, and Titi; but at all times his\r\ncolouring was inharmonious; the second has little to boast of beyond his\r\ndesign. Both are honourably mentioned among the academicians; as is also\r\nStefano Pieri, who assisted Vasari in the cupola of the metropolitan\r\nchurch. The sacrifice of Isaac, of the Pitti palace, is ascribed to him,\r\nand it is the best of his works executed at Rome, which are censured as\r\nhard and dry by Baglione. Cristofano dell'Altissimo, whose talent lay in\r\nportrait painting, may be added to these. Giovio had formed the\r\ncelebrated collection of portraits of illustrious men, which is still\r\npreserved at Como, though now divided between the two families of the\r\nConti Giovio, one of which possesses the portraits of learned men, the\r\nother those of warriors. From this collection, which the prelate styled\r\nhis museum, that still existing at Mondragone was copied, and also the\r\ncollection now in the Florentine gallery, by the labours of Cristofano,\r\nwho was sent for that purpose to Como by Cosmo I. He copied the features\r\nof those celebrated men, but attended little to other circumstances;\r\nwhence it happens that the Giovian collection exhibits many very\r\ndissimilar manners, the Medicean one alone; but the features of the\r\noriginals are very faithfully expressed.\r\n\r\nMichele di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio instructed many artists in this\r\nepoch. From his school, proceeded Girolamo Macchietti, or G. del\r\nCrocifissaio, the assistant of Vasari for six years, who afterwards\r\nstudied for two years at Rome, though already an adept in the art. His\r\nexample merits imitation, for that school speaks more to the eye than\r\nthe ear; and he who there employs his eyes judiciously, cannot fail to\r\nreap the advantage. After his return to Florence he finished a few\r\nvaluable pictures with care and assiduity, among which may be noticed an\r\nEpiphany for the chapel of the Marquis Della Stufa, at S. Lorenzo, and a\r\nmartyrdom of S. Lorenzo S. Maria Novella, which is greatly praised by\r\nLomazzo. Borghini also, after commending the beauty, the expression, and\r\nthe picture in general, scarcely found any thing to censure. It is\r\ncertainly among the most striking pictures in that church. Macchietti\r\nalso went to Spain, and was not a little employed at Naples and at\r\nBenevento, where he is said to have painted his best pictures. In the\r\nDizionario Storico of the professors of the fine arts at Urbino (Colucci\r\ntom. xxxi.) I find mention that Girolamo Macchietti produced some\r\nbattle-pieces for the hall of the Albani at S. Giovanni; but I see no\r\nreason why he should be admitted to a place among native artists\r\nbelonging to that city, or to the state of Urbino.\r\n\r\nVasari mentions Andrea del Minga, then a youth, as contemporary with\r\nMacchietti; yet he is reckoned by Orlandi and Bottari, the\r\nfellow student of Michelangiolo. He was among the last pupils of Ridolfo\r\ndel Ghirlandaio, when the school was chiefly under the direction of\r\nMichele; and hence he rather followed the latter than the former. His\r\nown works are by no means among the most excellent. In the Prayer in the\r\nGarden, which remains in the church of the Holy Cross, he rivals any of\r\nhis contemporaries; and hence it is alleged, that he was assisted in\r\nthis picture by three of his friends. Francesco Traballesi, mentioned by\r\nBaglione as the painter of some historical frescos in the Greek church\r\nat Rome, was a pupil of Michele, but lived too short a time to do him\r\nhonour. The fable of Danae, on the writing desk, is the work of his\r\nbrother Bartolommeo.\r\n\r\nAbout this time lived Bernardino Barbatelli, surnamed Poccetti, an\r\nartist omitted by Vasari in the school of Michele, and in the catalogue\r\nof the academicians; because at that period he painted only grotesques\r\nand fronts of buildings, in which, though he had arrived at great\r\neminence, he had not the reputation he afterwards attained in Rome as an\r\narchitect, from assiduously studying the works of Raffaello, and of\r\nother great masters. He subsequently returned to his native place, not\r\nonly a pleasing and graceful figurist, but rich and learned in his\r\ncompositions; hence he was enabled to adorn his historical subjects with\r\nbeautiful landscapes, with sea-views, with fruit, and flowers, not to\r\nmention the magnificence of his draperies, and tapestries, which he\r\nimitated to admiration. Very few of his pictures on panel or on canvass,\r\nbut many of his frescos, remain in almost every corner of Florence; nor\r\ndoes he yield to many Italian masters in this art. Pietro da Cortona\r\nused to express his astonishment that he was in his time less esteemed\r\nthan he merited; and Mengs never came to Florence without going to study\r\nhim, and diligently searching after his most forgotten frescos. He often\r\npainted with careless haste, like a class of poets whose minds are\r\nimbued with Parnassian fury and fine imagery, and who recite verses with\r\nlittle preparation, and with little trouble. He is, however, always to\r\nbe admired, always shews facility and freedom, with that resolute and\r\nfirm pencil which never makes an erroneous touch; a circumstance from\r\nwhich he has been denominated the Paul of his school. He often studied\r\nand made great preparation for his works, and corrected his outline as\r\none would do in miniature painting. Whoever wishes to estimate the\r\npowers of this artist should examine the Miracle of the drowned restored\r\nto life in the cloister of the Santissima Nunziata, a picture reckoned\r\nby some connoisseurs among the best in the city. His fresco works are to\r\nbe met with nearly throughout all Tuscany, and his circular pictures in\r\nthe cloister of the Servi at Pistoja, are greatly commended.\r\n\r\nMaso Manzuoli, or M. di S. Friano, a scholar of Pierfrancesco di Jacopo\r\nand of Portelli, is esteemed equal to Naldini and Allori by Vasari. Nor\r\nwill this appear strange to any one who beholds his Visitation, which,\r\nfor many years, decorated S. Pier Maggiore, and was afterwards carried\r\nto Rome, where it was deposited in the gallery of the Vatican. It was\r\npainted when he was about thirty years of age; and, in the opinion of\r\nthe historian, it abounds with beauty and grace in the figures, in the\r\ndraperies, in the architecture, and in every other circumstance. This is\r\nhis finest work, and is even among the best of that age. In his other\r\npictures at S. Trinita, in the ducal gallery, and elsewhere, he is\r\nsomething dry; and may be compared to some writers who, though they\r\noffend not against grammar, are not entitled to the praise of eloquence.\r\nAlessandro Fei, or A. del Barbiere, was his companion, and partly his\r\nscholar. This artist, who painted in private, received his first\r\ninstruction in the school of Ghirlandaio, and of Piero Francia. He had a\r\nbold and fertile genius, adapted to large historical frescos, in which\r\nhe introduced fine architecture and grotesques. In his pictures he\r\nattended more to design and expression than to colouring; except in some\r\npieces, supposed to be his last productions, and executed after the\r\nreformation of the art by Cigoli. His picture of the Flagellation in S.\r\nCroce is highly approved by Borghini. Baldinucci admires him, especially\r\nin small historical subjects, such as, amongst the pieces on the writing\r\ndesk, are the Daniel at the Feast of Belshazzar, and that of the\r\ngoldsmith's art.\r\n\r\nFederigo Zuccaro may be reckoned among the instructors of the artists of\r\nthis epoch; for whilst employed in painting the cupola of the cathedral,\r\nwhere Vasari had only finished a few figures at his death, he taught\r\npainting to Bartolommeo Carducci, who became an architect and statuary\r\nunder Amannati, and an artificer in stucco under another master.\r\nCarducci acquired distinction by those talents in the court of his\r\nCatholic Majesty, where he was introduced by Zuccaro; and where he\r\nestablished himself and his younger brother and pupil, Vincenzio. Both\r\nare mentioned by Palomino among the eminent artists who painted in the\r\ncourt of Spain. Both must be well known there; especially the latter,\r\nwho lived but little at Florence, and who painted more pictures when in\r\nthe service of Philip III. and Philip IV. than any of his predecessors\r\nor successors. He printed a dialogue in the Spanish tongue, _De las\r\nExcelencias de la Pintura_, from which Baldinucci has quoted some\r\npassages in the account of this artist.\r\n\r\nOf some of the artists mentioned by Vasari as his assistants in the\r\ndecoration of the palace, in the preparations for the marriage of Prince\r\nFrancesco, in the funeral obsequies of Bonarruoti, or in the collection\r\nof pictures on the writing desk, the masters are unknown; and the\r\nknowledge would be of little consequence. Such artists are Domenico\r\nBenci, and Tommaso del Verrocchio, whom he names in his third volume at\r\npage 873, and Federigo di Lamberto, a Fleming, called F. del Padovano,\r\nwhom he had a little before noticed as a new citizen of Florence, and as\r\na considerable ornament to the academy. Omitted by Vasari, but inscribed\r\non the writing desk, we find the names of Niccolo Betti, who painted the\r\nstory of Caesar; of Vittor Casini, who there represented the Forge of\r\nVulcan; of Mirabello Cavalori, who pourtrayed Lavinia Sacrificing, and\r\nalso the emblems of the art of weaving; of Jacopo Coppi, who there\r\npainted the Family of Darius, and the invention of gunpowder. I suspect\r\nthat they were all scholars of Michele; and Vasari has more than once\r\nthus generally noticed them. Perhaps Cavalori is the Salincorno\r\nmentioned in another place, and Coppi is believed to be that Jacopo di\r\nMeglio, who is more severely treated by Borghini than any other in the\r\nchurch of the Holy Cross; and not without reason; for his _Ecce Homo_ in\r\nthat place has all the defects of this epoch. Whether Coppi is to be\r\nidentified with this person or not, he cannot be equally reprehended for\r\nhis pictures on the writing desk; and in S. Salvator at Bologna, he\r\nproduced a picture of the Redeemer Crucified by the Jews, that might vie\r\nwith the best pictures in that city previous to the time of the Caracci,\r\nand is yet one of those most full of subject and most carefully studied.\r\nHe imitated Vasari in colouring, and in propriety of invention, in\r\nvariety of figures, and in diligence in every part, I have seen no\r\npicture of Vasari by which it is surpassed. It bears the date of 1579,\r\ntogether with his name. There is an account of two of his frescos in the\r\nGuida di Roma; one of which, very copious in subject, is placed in the\r\ntribune of S. Pietro in Vincoli.\r\n\r\nTo the same period belongs the name of Piero di Ridolfo, by whom there\r\nis a large altar-piece, consisting of the Ascension, and bearing the\r\ndate 1612; it is supposed that he took his name from the last of the\r\nGhirlandai, in whose service he may have been during his early life.\r\nWhoever may be desirous of adding to the list of names, will find a\r\ngreat number in a letter of Borghini to the Prince D. Francesco (Lett.\r\nPittor. tom. i. p. 90), in which he suggests a plan for the preparations\r\nof the Prince's nuptials, as well as the artists best qualified to\r\nconduct them. The names, however, I here give would be more than amply\r\nsufficient, were it not my wish to illustrate Vasari by every means in\r\nmy power.\r\n\r\nAfter considering the artists of Florence, on turning to the rest of\r\nTuscany, we find in many places other associates of Giorgio, who,\r\nperhaps, had as many assistants in painting as bricklayers in\r\narchitecture. Stefano Veltroni, of Monte Sansavino, his cousin, was a\r\nman of slow parts, but very respectable in the art. He assisted Vasari\r\nin the vineyard of Pope Julius; or rather he superintended the grotesque\r\nworks in that place; and followed his cousin to Naples, to Bologna, and\r\nto Florence. I know not whether Orazio Porta, likewise a native of\r\nSansavino, and Alessandro Fortori of Arezzo, ever left Tuscany; they\r\nappear to have painted chiefly in their native city and its vicinity.\r\nBastiano Flori and Fra Salvatore Foschi, both natives of Arezzo, were\r\nemployed in the Roman Chancery, along with Bagnacavallo, and the\r\nSpaniards Ruviale and Bizzerra. Andrea Aretino, the scholar of Daniello,\r\nlived at a later period, or at least until 1615.[207]\r\n\r\nAbout this time Citta San Sepolcro was a seminary for painters, who were\r\neither wholly or chiefly educated by Raffaellino; and from this place\r\nVasari invited not only the master, but several of the scholars to\r\nassist him in his labours. He was greatly assisted by Cristoforo\r\nGherardi, surnamed Doceno, whose life he has written. This artist was\r\nhis right hand, if we may be allowed the expression, in almost every\r\nplace where he was much employed. Gherardi followed his designs with a\r\nfreedom resulting from a genius pliant, copious, and natural, adapted to\r\nornamental works. Such was his talent for managing fresco colours, that\r\nVasari pronounces himself his inferior: but the grotesques of the\r\nVitelli palace, which are wholly his own, shew him not to have been more\r\nvigorous in his colouring. The oil picture of the Visitation in the\r\nchurch of S. Domenico, at Citta di Castello, is entirely his own; but\r\nVasari does not mention it. The upper part of the picture of S. Maria\r\ndel Popolo, at Perugia, is likewise his; and is no less elegant and\r\ngraceful, than the lower part, which is the work of Lattanzio della\r\nMarca, is firm and vigorous. Doceno died in his native place in 1552;\r\nand Cosmo I. honoured his tomb with a bust of marble, and an epitaph, in\r\nwhich he is said to be _Pingendi arte praestantissimus_, and Vasari, who\r\nhad approved of his labours in the old palace, is called _hujus artis\r\nfacile princeps_. It is written in the name of all the Tuscan\r\npainters,[208] and is alone sufficient to demonstrate the state of this\r\nschool, and the taste of Cosmo. After this specimen, it is not\r\nsurprising that the prince neglected to have his portrait painted by\r\nTiziano, whom he would esteem little in comparison to his own Vasari. It\r\nis a true observation that virtues are not hereditary, or, as it is\r\nexpressed by the poet, they rarely spring up again in the branches. Leo\r\nX. was the patron of the arts, and he knew how to appreciate them; but\r\nCosmo encouraged, without possessing taste to discriminate.\r\n\r\nThe Three Cungi (or Congi, as some will have it) are also claimed by San\r\nSepolcro. Gio. Batista was the servant of Vasari for seven years;\r\nLionardo is described to us as an eminent designer, in the life of\r\nPerino, and in that of Zuccaro is said to have been a painter employed\r\nin the pontifical palace about 1560, along with his countryman Durante\r\ndel Nero. For a knowledge of the third brother, Francesco, I am indebted\r\nto my learned friend Sig. Annibale Lancisi; and I have since received\r\nmore particular information from Sig. Giachi, who gives an account of an\r\naltar-piece of S. Sebastiano, in the cathedral at Volterra, together\r\nwith the receipt for its purchase money in 1587, where he is called\r\n_Francesco di Leonardo Cugni da Borgo_. At Rome we cannot judge properly\r\nof their style, but it may be discovered in their own country, in the\r\nchurch of S. Rocco, at the convent of the Osservanti, and in other\r\nplaces. Their compositions display great simplicity, their ideas are\r\nchiefly drawn from nature, and they attended sufficiently to colouring.\r\nRaffaele Scaminossi, a scholar of Raffaellino, painted in a similar but\r\nsomewhat more lively manner. I learn nothing of Giovanni Paolo del\r\nBorgo, except that he was the assistant of Vasari in his very hasty\r\nlabours in the Chancery, about 1545. He cannot be the Gio. de' Vecchi\r\nwho painted so much in Rome, as we are informed by Baglione; and who\r\nchiefly excelled at Caprarola, when contending with Taddeo Zuccaro, and\r\nin the church of S. Lorenzo in Damaso, in the various histories of the\r\nMartyr. He appears to have arrived at a later period, as did the three\r\nAlberti, who were of a family in San Sepolcro, abounding in painters.\r\nThey went to study at Rome, and easily formed themselves on the style\r\ncommon to artists in the time of Gregory XIII. There they took up their\r\nabode, and there died, after having executed many works, especially in\r\nfresco, in that city, and also some memorials of their art in their\r\nnative country.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral contains a Nativity by Durante, a subject which he handled\r\nbetter in the Vallicella of Rome, and which is, perhaps, his best\r\nperformance in that city: in others he is often languid, both in design\r\nand colouring, and appears rather a laborious artist than a man of\r\ngenius. Cherubino, the reputed son of Michele, and the assistant of\r\nDaniel di Volterra,[209] was a celebrated engraver on copper, and from\r\nthis art he derived great assistance in design. Although late in\r\napplying to painting, he obtained a name in those times. His proportions\r\nwere light and spirited; his choirs of angels were agreeable and\r\noriginal; his penciling and whole composition were dexterous and\r\nspontaneous. Such is the character of his Trinity in the cathedral of\r\nBorgo, in which place there remains the facade of a palace, well\r\nconceived, ornamented with arms, genii, and other fanciful devices. He\r\npainted the ceiling of the chapel of Minerva in Rome with various\r\nornaments and figures, on a golden ground; in that city, however, he\r\ngenerally assisted his younger brother Giovanni, who introduced a new\r\nera in perspective; not only by his works, existing in the houses of\r\nprivate individuals at San Sepolcro, and other cities, but by the fresco\r\nperspectives which he executed at Rome. He claims admiration in the\r\nsacristy of the church of S. Gio. Laterano, where he imitated the\r\nsalient and receding angles of architecture; and still more in the grand\r\nClementine salon, the most prodigious and exquisite work in perspective\r\nthen existing. Baglione highly commends the S. Clement and other figures\r\nwith which it is ornamented; and remarks that they are admirably\r\nforeshortened, and are superior to those of Cherubino, who was not so\r\neminent in perspectives. Baglione mentions a Francesco, the son of\r\nDurante, who died at Rome. I am uncertain whether he is the\r\nPierfrancesco to whom we attribute the Ascension, in the church of S.\r\nBartholomew at Borgo, with some pictures of no great merit in the church\r\nof S. John, and in other places. History mentions also Donato, Girolamo,\r\nCosimo, and Alessandro Alberti, of whom I can collect nothing further.\r\n\r\nThe writers of Prato exalt their countryman, Domenico Giuntalocchio,\r\npupil to Soggi, in whose life Vasari mentions Domenico more as an\r\nengineer than a painter. He describes him as a correct portrait painter,\r\nbut so extremely tardy in his works in fresco, that he became tiresome\r\nto the Aretini, with whom he for some time dwelt. I cannot point out any\r\ngenuine picture from his hand; but his memory is still fresh in the\r\nminds of his fellow citizens, because, instead of leaving his native\r\nplace ornamented with his pictures, he left 10,000 crowns as a fund to\r\nbe appropriated to the education of young artists.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Daniel, his scholar and relation Giovanni Paolo\r\nRossetti, retired to Volterra, and, as is attested by Vasari, executed\r\nworks of great merit in this his native place; among which we may reckon\r\nthe Deposto, in the church of S. Dalmatius. At a short distance from the\r\ncity is a place which gave name to Niccolo dalle Pomarance, of the\r\nfamily of Circignani. Vasari describes him as a young man of ability. He\r\nneglects to inform us who was his master; but he appears to have been\r\nTiti, whom he assisted in the great salon of the Belvidere palace. He\r\ngrew old in Rome, where he left numerous specimens of the labours of his\r\npencil, which he employed with freedom, and at a good price. He shewed\r\nhimself greatly superior to the artists of this period, in some of his\r\nworks, as in the Cupola of S. Pudenziana. Cavalier Roncalli was a native\r\nof the same place; there are pictures by them both at Pomarance; where\r\nthere are also some by Antonio Circignani, the son of the former, an\r\nable artist, though little known. All three will again be treated of in\r\nthe third book.\r\n\r\nPistoia possessed at the same time two scholars of Ricciarelli; Biagio\r\nda Cutigliano, noticed by Vasari,[210] and P. Biagio Betti Teatino, a\r\nminiature painter, sculptor, and historical painter of merit, whom\r\nBaglione represents as constantly employed in the service of the church\r\nand convent to which he belonged. Leghorn gave birth to Jacopo\r\nRosignoli, pupil of an unknown master, who lived in Piedmont, where his\r\nworks must be sought. Baccio Lomi, whose style much resembles that of\r\nZuccaro, remained at Pisa: he owes much of his skill and of his\r\nreputation to his two nephews, as we shall afterwards relate. Though\r\nunknown beyond the limits of his native country, he must not be passed\r\nover in silence. The Assumption, in the residence of the Canons, and\r\nsome of his other pictures, participate of the hardness of the age, but\r\nexhibit very good design and colouring.\r\n\r\nPaolo Guidotti distinguished himself in the neighbouring state of Lucca,\r\nas a painter of genius and of spirit, no less than a man of letters, and\r\nwell grounded in anatomical knowledge; but his taste was not polished\r\nand refined. He came to Rome in the distracted times of Gregory and\r\nSixtus, and lived there during the pontificate of Paul V., who created\r\nhim a knight, and conservator of Rome: he further permitted him to\r\nassume the additional name of Borghese, the family name of the pontiff.\r\nMany of his paintings in fresco are preserved at Rome, in the Vatican\r\nlibrary, in the Apostolic chamber, and in several churches: the artists\r\nwith whom he was associated, prove that he was reputed a good artist.\r\nSeveral of his pictures are in his native place; and there is a large\r\npiece representing the Republic, in the palace. Girolamo Massei pursued\r\na similar track, only confining himself to the art of painting.\r\nBaglione, who gave an account of him, introduces him into Rome as an\r\nartist, already much commended for his accuracy; to which Taia adds,\r\nthat he was both a good designer and colourist; so much so as to lead us\r\nto distinguish him from the crowd of Gregorian and Sixtine\r\npractitioners, in the same way that he was chosen by P. Danti to\r\nornament the chambers of the Vatican; of which more hereafter. He\r\nreturned to his native place in his old age, not to employ himself anew,\r\nbut to die in tranquillity among his friends. Benedetto Brandimarte, of\r\nLucca, is mentioned by Orlandi. I saw a decollation of S. John by this\r\nartist in the church of S. Peter, at Genoa, which was but a miserable\r\nperformance; a single production, however, is not sufficient to decide\r\nthe character of an artist.\r\n\r\nThe name of a Pietro Ferabosco is mentioned only by the continuator of\r\nOrlandi; he is supposed to have been a native of Lucca, though he is\r\nreferred to the academy of Rome, where he probably pursued his first\r\nstudies; I say _probably_, because the excellence of his colouring in\r\nthe Titian manner, would lead me rather to include him among the\r\nVenetian artists. There are three of his half-length figures, together\r\nwith his name, and the date of 1616, reported as being in the possession\r\nof a gentleman in Portugal; where he resided, most likely, a longer\r\nperiod than in Italy.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed some Tuscans who acquired distinction in the\r\ninferior branches of painting; such as Veltroni, Constantino de' Servi,\r\nZucchi, and Alberti: Antonio Tempesti, of Florence, a scholar both of\r\nTiti and Stradano, was among the first to acquire a celebrated name in\r\nItaly for landscapes and for battles. He practised engraving on copper,\r\nprepared cartoons for tapestry, and gave scope to his genius in the most\r\nfanciful inventions in grotesque and ornamental work. He surpassed his\r\nmaster in spirit, and was inferior to none, not even to the Venetians.\r\nIn a Letter on Painting by the Marquis Giustiniani,[211] he is adduced\r\nas an example of great spirit in design, a gift conferred by nature, and\r\nnot to be acquired by art. He attempted few things on a large scale, and\r\nwas not so successful as in small pictures. The Marquis Niccolini, the\r\nOrder of the Nunziata, and several Florentine families, possess some of\r\nhis battles painted on alabaster, in which he appears the precursor of\r\nBorgognone, who is said to have studied him attentively. He most\r\nfrequently painted in fresco, as at Caprarola, in the Este Villa at\r\nTivoli, and in many parts of Rome, from the time of Gregory XIII. Most\r\nof the historical pictures in the Vatican gallery are the work of his\r\nhands; the figures are a palm and a half high, and display astonishing\r\nvariety and spirit, accompanied by beautiful architecture and\r\nlandscapes, with every species of decoration. He is not, however, very\r\ncorrect; and his tints are sometimes too much inclined to a brownish\r\nhue; but all such faults are pardonable in him, as being occasioned by\r\nthat pictoric fury which inspired him, that fancy which hurried him from\r\nearth, and conducted him through novel and sublime regions, unattempted\r\nby the vulgar herd of artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: \"All painters seem to worship him as their great master,\r\nprince, and god of design.\" It is thus Monsig. Claudio Tolomei writes in\r\na letter to Apollonio Filareto, towards the end of the fifth book. Such\r\nis the opinion of the artists of the Leonine age, whatever may be the\r\njudgment passed in the age of Pius VI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Baldinucci, tom. ix. p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: He executed a picture of S. Sigismund for the church of\r\nS. Lorenzo, at the desire of the noble family of Martelli, which\r\ndelighted the Duke Cosmo. This picture ought to be removed from the\r\naltar, for the tints are fading.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: We learn from Pliny, that Filosseno Eretrio, celeritatem\r\npraeceptoris (Nicomachi) secutus breviores etiamnum quasdam picturae vias,\r\net compendiarias invenit. (Lib. XXXV. cap. 36.) We perceive, however,\r\nfrom the context, that his pictures were no less perfect on that\r\naccount; and I believe that those compendious means were more\r\nparticularly connected with the mechanism of the art.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: See Lettere Pittoriche, tom. ii. let. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: Bald. tom. ix. p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: See his \"Description of the preparations for the marriage\r\nof the Prince D.

S. e Beati Toscani;\" among which is found that of B.\r\nGiovanni. But this indication would be little; or at least it is not\r\nall. The document which clearly reveals the fact, has been pointed out\r\nto me by the polite attention of Sig. Luigi de Poirot, Secretary to the\r\nRoyal Finances; and this is in the \"Vite de' SS. e BB. dell' ordine de'\r\nFrati Predicatori di Serafino Razzi Domenicano,\" published after the\r\ndeath of Vasari, in Florence, 1577. In these, treating of works in the\r\nfine arts in S. Domenico at Bologna, he adds; \"we cannot give a\r\nparticular account of these histories, but whoever is desirous of it may\r\nconsult the whole, in the Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and\r\nArchitects, written, _for the most part_, by D. Silvano Razzi, my\r\nbrother, for the Cav. Giorgio Vasari of Arezzo, his very intimate\r\nfriend.\" After such information, we must suppose that Vasari, having\r\ncommunicated his materials to this monk, received from him a great\r\nnumber of Lives, that boast such elegant prefaces and fine reflections;\r\nbut that he here and there retouched them; adding things either from\r\nhaste or inadvertency, not well connected with the context, or repeated\r\nelsewhere. And in this way we may account for the many inconsistencies\r\nto be met with in a number of Lives, very finely written, but containing\r\npassages that do not appear to come from the same pen, and frequently\r\nmake the author contradict himself.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: It is to be observed that Bottari wrote principally to\r\nmark the changes that the works described by Vasari had undergone during\r\n200 years. In regard to the emendations pointed out by us, he declares\r\nin the Preface, that he could not undertake them for want of time,\r\nhealth, books, and most of all, inclination. However, we are indebted\r\nfor not a few to him, and also to P. Guglielmo, though not equally so in\r\nevery school.

As we have above\r\nremarked, they began to exhibit some diversity after the age of Titi;\r\nbut they were still languid colourists, and required to be impelled into\r\nanother career. About 1580 the period had at length arrived, when they\r\nbegan to abandon the manner of their countrymen for that of foreign\r\nartists; and then, as we shall have occasion to shew in treating of this\r\nepoch, the Florentine styles became firm and varied. This revolution\r\noriginated with two young artists, Lodovico Cigoli and Gregorio Pagani.\r\nWe learn from Baldinucci, that, attracted by the celebrity of Barocci,\r\nand a picture which he had recently sent from Urbino to Arezzo, which is\r\nnow in the royal gallery at Florence, they went together to see it; they\r\nexamined it attentively, and were so captivated with the style, that\r\nthey immediately renounced the manner of their master. Passignano\r\nfollowed their steps, continues Baldinucci, and Cigoli, in his company,\r\ntook a second journey as far as Perugia, when Barocci had completed his\r\ncelebrated Deposition from the Cross; but here the historian fell into a\r\nchronological error, inasmuch as Bellori, the accurate writer of\r\nBarocci's life, describes his picture at Perugia as anterior to that at\r\nArezzo by several years. In whatever way the mistake ought to be cleared\r\nup, it is certain that Passignano promoted the views of Cigoli. Their\r\nexample turned the rising generation from the old manner to a more\r\nvigorous style. This was more especially the case with Empoli, with Cav.\r\nCurradi, and some of those above mentioned, who were followed by\r\nCristofano Allori, and Rosselli, artists that transmitted the new method\r\nto their new disciples. They did not, however, imitate Barocci so much\r\nas Correggio, who was the model of Barocci. Unable to visit Lombardy,\r\nthey studied the few copies of his pictures, and still fewer originals,\r\nthat were to be met with in Florence, in order to acquire his management\r\nof chiaroscuro, a branch of the art then neglected in Florence, and even\r\nat Rome. To this end they began to model in clay and wax; they wrought\r\nin plaster; they studied attentively the effects of light and shade;\r\nthey paid less attention to practical rules, and more to nature. Hence\r\narose a new style which, in my opinion, is among the best hitherto\r\nattempted in Italy; corrected upon the model of the Florentine school;\r\nsoft and well relieved on that of Lombardy. If their forms had\r\napproached to Grecian elegance, if their expression had been more\r\nrefined, the improvement of painting, which about this time took place\r\nin Italy, should have been ascribed no less to Florence than to Bologna.\r\n\r\nSome favourable circumstances assisted the progress of the Florentine\r\nschool; among these we may mention a succession of princes friendly to\r\nthe art;[212] the readiness with which the celebrated Galileo imparted\r\nto artists his discoveries, and the laws of perspective; the travels of\r\nseveral Florentine masters to Venice, and through Lombardy; and the long\r\nresidence of foreign artists, eminent as colourists, at the court of\r\nFlorence. But it was chiefly owing to Ligozzi, who studied under the\r\nVenetian masters, then considered as the best in Italy, and who animated\r\nthe old Florentine style with greater spirit and brilliancy than it had\r\nhitherto displayed. After noticing the good style of that period, we\r\nmust not omit to mention one less praiseworthy; a sombre manner, which\r\nusurped the place of the other, and at this day renders many pictures of\r\nthat period of little or no value. Some ascribe the fault to the method\r\nof mixing the colours, which was everywhere changed; and hence it is not\r\npeculiar to the Florentines, but is found diffused over Italy. It was\r\npartly owing likewise to the rage for chiaroscuro carried to excess. It\r\nis the characteristic of every school of long standing to carry to an\r\nerroneous excess the fundamental maxims of its master: this we have\r\nremarked in the preceding epoch, this we shall find exemplified in every\r\nperiod of painting, and this, if it were consistent with our present\r\nundertaking, we might demonstrate to have happened in literature; for a\r\ngood rule extravagantly pursued leads to the corruption of taste. We\r\nshall now direct our attention to the fourth epoch, in which, omitting\r\nthe two older authorities, Vasari and Borghini, we shall chiefly follow\r\nBaldinucci, who was acquainted with the artists we are now to consider,\r\nor with their successors.[213]\r\n\r\nLodovico Cardi da Cigoli, the scholar of Santi di Tito, first awakened\r\nhis countrymen to a nobler style, as we have already observed. The\r\nadditional observation of Baldinucci, that he perhaps surpassed all his\r\ncontemporaries, and that few or none derived such benefit as he did,\r\nfrom the study of Correggio, will not readily be granted by those who\r\nare conversant with Schedone, the Caracci, or even Barocci, when they\r\nchose to imitate the manner of that great master. From the pictures that\r\nhave reached our time, Cigoli appears to have acquired a fine effect of\r\nlight and shade from Correggio; to have united this to a scientific\r\ndesign, to a judicious perspective, the rules of which were previously\r\ntaught him by Buontalenti, and to a vivacity of colouring superior to\r\nhis countrymen, among whom he unquestionably holds a high rank. His\r\nworks, however, exhibit not that contrast of colouring, that mellowness\r\nand clearness, that grace in foreshortenings and features, that\r\ncharacterize the ornament of the Lombard school. In short he was the\r\ninventor of a style always beautiful, but not always equal; especially\r\nif we compare his early works with his pictures executed after his visit\r\nto Rome. His general colouring savours of the school of Lombardy, his\r\ndraperies sometimes resemble those of Paolo Veronese, and he often\r\nrivals the bold style of Guercino.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the great number of his pictures in the royal gallery,\r\nand many in the possession of the noble family of Pecori, there are a\r\nfew in some private houses in Florence. The following are his most\r\nesteemed pictures: the Trinity, in S. Croce; the S. Alberto, in S. Maria\r\nMaggiore; the Martyrdom of St. Stephen, in the nunnery of Monte Domini,\r\nwhich Pietro da Cortona considers one of the finest pictures in\r\nFlorence. Of the same class is the picture which he placed in the church\r\nof the Conventualists at Cortona, in which S. Anthony is represented in\r\nthe act of converting an unbeliever, by a miracle of a mule that is seen\r\nkneeling before the holy sacrament: in this piece he aspired at\r\nsurpassing any work of art in that highly decorated city. In the Vatican\r\nhe painted S. Peter healing the Lame, a wonderful production, which,\r\namong the pictures in Rome, was reckoned by Sacchi next in excellence to\r\nthe Transfiguration by Raffaello, and the S. Girolamo by Domenichino.\r\nThe Florentine school may well be proud of this opinion, pronounced as\r\nit was by a profound connoisseur, by no means usually lavish of his\r\ncommendations. This masterpiece, which obtained him the honour of\r\nknighthood, is, however, utterly ruined by the dampness of the church,\r\nand the ignorance of one who undertook to repair it: but his frescos in\r\nthe church of S. Maria Maggiore at Rome still remain; and there, by some\r\nerror in perspective, he appears inferior to himself;[214] nor was he\r\npermitted to retouch them, notwithstanding that he employed both\r\ninterest and entreaties to that effect. Fortune, in some degree,\r\npersecuted this great artist; for had those frescos perished, and that\r\noil painting remained to our times, Cigoli would have enjoyed a higher\r\nfame, and Baldinucci obtained more credit.\r\n\r\nAndrea Comodi and Giovanni Bilivert, nearly approached Cigoli; Aurelio\r\nLomi followed at a greater distance. Of the latter, I shall speak among\r\nthe Pisan artists, a few pages further on; and of two Romans, belonging\r\nto the same school, in the third book. Comodi, the associate rather than\r\nthe scholar of Cigoli, is almost unknown at Florence; but there are many\r\nof his copies after celebrated masters, which often pass for originals,\r\nboth in that city and at Rome. This was his peculiar talent; in this he\r\nwas unrivalled; and it employed his best years. He produced, however,\r\nseveral original works that are highly valuable for the design, the\r\nexquisite finish, and the strong body of colouring they display. In\r\nthese we may trace the friend of Cigoli, and the copyist of Raffaello.\r\nThey are chiefly Madonnas, and are greatly admired for the disposition\r\nof the fingers, which are somewhat spread out, for the graceful slender\r\nneck, and a certain virgin air peculiarly his own. The Corsini family at\r\nRome possess a very fine one. Some of his fresco pictures remain in the\r\nchurch of S. Vitale, in that city; and there is a picture of the Titular\r\nsaint in S. Carlo a' Catinari, which appears dark and cloudy; an\r\nuncommon circumstance with so good a colourist.\r\n\r\nGio. Bilivert is a name which we in vain look for in Orlandi, who has\r\ntransformed him into two painters, one of whom he calls Antonio\r\nBiliverti, and the other, in imitation of Baglione, whose knowledge of\r\nhim was inaccurate, Gio. Ballinert; both Florentines, and pupils of\r\nCigoli. Like the preceding artist, Bilivert is not always equal to\r\nhimself. He finished some pictures that had been left imperfect by\r\nCigoli, to whose design and colouring he endeavoured to unite the\r\nexpression of Titi, and a more avowed and frequent imitation of the\r\nornaments of Paolo Veronese. Bilivert is not sufficiently choice in\r\nheads; but he abounds in expression, as may be seen at S. Gaetano and S.\r\nMarco, where there are many of his historical pictures, particularly the\r\nRaising of the Cross, esteemed one of his best performances. Those\r\npieces which he engaged to execute, and in which he never appears able\r\nto satisfy himself, are repeated by his scholars: sometimes inscribed\r\nwith the initials of his name, especially when he himself retouched\r\nthem; at other times they are without an epigraph. None of his\r\nproductions are so worthy of being copied as Joseph with Potiphar's\r\nwife; which arrests the eye of every spectator in the ducal gallery.\r\nMany copies of it are to be found in Florence; it may be seen in foreign\r\ncollections, in the Barberini Palace at Rome, in the Obizzo collection\r\nat Cattaio, and in several other places.\r\n\r\nThe ornamented style of Bilivert had many imitators, whose works, in\r\ngalleries and in private houses, would pass for those of Venetian\r\nartists, had they greater spirit and a better colouring. Bartolommeo\r\nSalvestrini is at their head; but he was cut off in his prime, by the\r\nplague of 1630, so disastrous to Italy and the art. Orazio Fidani, an\r\nassiduous artist, and skilled in the style of his master, painted much\r\nat Florence; where his Tobias, that was finished for the fraternity of\r\nScala, but is now removed, is especially commended. Francesco Bianchi\r\nBuonavita was engaged in few public works. He was chiefly employed in\r\ncopying ancient pictures, which the court presented to foreign princes,\r\nand in furnishing cabinets with little historical pieces, that were at\r\nthat time in great request in countries beyond the Alps. They were\r\npainted on jasper, agate, lapis lazzuli, and other hard stones; the\r\nspots in which assisted in forming the shadows of the pictures. Agostino\r\nMelissi contributed much to the tapestry of the ducal family, by\r\nfurnishing cartoons from the works of Andrea del Sarto, and also some of\r\nhis own invention. He likewise possessed a genius for oil painting; in\r\nwhich branch his S. Peter at the Gate of Pilate, which he painted for\r\nthe noble family of Gaburri, is particularly praised by Baldinucci.\r\nFrancesco Montelatici, by some supposed a Pisan, by others a Florentine,\r\nand surnamed Cecco Bravo, from his quarrelsome disposition, abandoned\r\nthe style of Bilivert, or at least mixed it with that of Passignano. He\r\nwas a fanciful and spirited designer, and not a bad colourist. A fine\r\npainting of S. Niccolo Vescovo, by this artist, is to be seen at the\r\nchurch of S. Simone; but his works are rare in churches, for he was\r\nchiefly employed in painting for private, and sometimes for royal\r\ncollections. He died painter to the court of Inspruck. Giovanni Maria\r\nMorandi remained but a little time with Bilivert, and on going to Rome,\r\nadopted the style of that school.\r\n\r\nGregorio Pagani was the son of Francesco, who died young; but was highly\r\nesteemed by his countrymen. He had studied the works of Polidoro and of\r\nMichelangiolo, at Rome, and executed admirable imitations of them for\r\nprivate gentlemen in Florence. Gregorio himself could scarcely\r\ndistinguish them. He received the rudiments of his art from Titi, but\r\nwas initiated in a better style by Cigoli. Strangers praised him as a\r\nsecond Cigoli, whilst his country possessed at the Carmine the picture\r\nof the Finding of the Cross, which has been engraved; but when the\r\npainting, with the church, was consumed by fire, no great work of his\r\nremained in public, except a few of his frescos; one of which, though\r\nsomewhat injured by time, is an ornament to the cloister of S. Maria\r\nNovella. He is rarely to be met with in Florentine collections, as he\r\nchiefly painted for foreigners. Of his school I here say nothing: it\r\nonly produced one eminent pupil; but this one was so conspicuous that he\r\nmay be said to form a new era, as we shall find in the sequel.\r\n\r\nAnother associate of Cigoli was Domenico da Passignano, the scholar of\r\nNaldini and of Federigo Zuccaro, whom he resembles most, from his long\r\nresidence at Venice; where he likewise married. He became so decided an\r\nadmirer of the merits of this school, that he was accustomed to say that\r\nhe who had not seen Venice, ought not to boast that he was a painter.\r\nThis circumstance sufficiently accounts for his style, which is not the\r\nmost profound, nor the most correct; but it exhibits contrivance, is\r\nvast, rich in architecture and in drapery, resembling more the manner of\r\nPaolo Veronese, than that of the Florentine school. Sometimes he\r\nresembles Tintoretto in his attitudes, and in that oily colouring which\r\nought to have been avoided; and through which many works of both artists\r\nhave perished. This has been the fate of his Crucifixion of St. Peter,\r\nwhich he executed for the great church in Rome, under Paul V. and of the\r\nPresentation of M. V. which he also painted at the same place under\r\nUrban VIII. Several pictures, however, remain in some Italian cities,\r\nthat were begun by his scholars and finished by him, with a degree of\r\ncare that hands him down to posterity as a great artist. A dead Christ,\r\nin the chapel of Mongradone, at Frascati, is in this style; as are an\r\nEntombing of Christ, in the Borghese palace, at Rome; a Christ bearing\r\nthe Cross, in the college of S. Giovannino, and some other works of his\r\nat Florence. Passignano, his native place, possesses what is perhaps his\r\nmost perfect work, in the font of the Church of the Fathers of\r\nVallombrosa. He there painted a Glory, that proclaims him an excellent\r\nartist, and worthy of a place with his pupils, Lodovico Caracci, the\r\nfounder of the Bolognese school, and Tirani, one of its great ornaments.\r\nHis Tuscan pupils did not attain equal celebrity. Sorri of Siena, whom\r\nwe reserve for that school, is the one best known in Italy; having\r\npainted with applause in several of her cities. Here we must consider\r\nthose artists connected with Florence.\r\n\r\nFabrizio Boschi is a spirited painter, whose characteristic excellence\r\nappears to consist in novelty of composition, united to a precision\r\nsuperior to the generality of his school. A S. Bonaventura in the act of\r\ncelebrating mass, in All Saints' church at Florence, is much praised:\r\nand, perhaps, his two historical frescos of Cosmo II. which he painted\r\nin the palace of Cardinal Gio. Carlo de' Medici, in emulation of\r\nRosselli, are superior to any of his other works. Ottavio Vannini became\r\neminent in colouring and was very attentive to every other branch of\r\npainting; but he was sometimes poor and cold; and although good in each\r\npart of his pictures, was not happy in the whole. Cesare Dandini, a\r\ndisciple of several schools, imitated Passignano in design, in\r\nbrilliancy, and also in the perishable nature of his colours: he was\r\ndiligent in other things, and very assiduous. His best picture is a S.\r\nCarlo, surrounded by other saints, in the church of Ancona: the\r\ncomposition is fine, and the whole in good preservation. Many works of\r\nthis artist, and of Vannini, decorate collections.\r\n\r\nNicodemo Ferrucci, the favourite pupil of Passignano, and the companion\r\nof his labours at Rome, possessed much of the boldness and spirit of his\r\nmaster. By his example he was led to affix a good price to his pictures,\r\nmostly frescos executed at Florence, Fiesole, and for the State. He died\r\nyoung at Fontebuoni; but many of his works, too good to be here omitted,\r\nstill remain in Rome; one of the most esteemed of which is found at S.\r\nGio. de' Fiorentini, besides two histories of Maria S. S. which, if I\r\nmistake not, have suffered from being retouched.\r\n\r\nCristofano Allori was at perpetual variance with Alessandro, his father\r\nand preceptor, on account of his attachment to the novel maxims of the\r\nthree masters we have just commended. In the opinion of many he is the\r\ngreatest painter of this epoch. When the excellence he attained, during\r\na long life, is considered, he appears to me in some degree, the\r\nCantarini of his school. They resembled each other in the beauty, grace,\r\nand exquisite finish of their figures; with this difference, that the\r\nbeauty of Cantarini partakes more of the ideal, and that the flesh tints\r\nof Allori are more happy. This circumstance is the more surprising,\r\ninasmuch as he knew nothing of the Caracci, nor of Guido; but supplied\r\nall by a nice discrimination, and an unwearied perseverance; for it was\r\nhis custom never to lift his pencil from the canvass until his hand had\r\nobeyed the dictates of his fancy. From this method, and from vicious\r\nhabits that often seduced him from his labours, his pictures are\r\nextremely rare, and he himself is little known. The S. Julian of the\r\nPitti palace is the grandest effort of his genius; and if it is not\r\namong the finest pictures in this magnificent collection, it undoubtedly\r\nclaims the highest rank in the second class. His picture of Beato\r\nManetto, in the church of the Servi, a small piece, but excellent in its\r\nkind, is reckoned the next in merit.\r\n\r\nMany young men were sent to be instructed by him in the art of painting;\r\nbut few of them remained long: most of them were disgusted at the\r\ndissipation of the master, and the insolence of some of their fellow\r\nstudents. He formed some landscape painters, whom we shall notice under\r\ntheir class; and also some copyists, whose labours may boast of hues and\r\nretouching, the work of his hand. Of this class were Valerio\r\nTanteri,[215] F. Bruno Certosino, and Lorenzo Cerrini. These, and other\r\nartists of this school, continued the Giovian series of the later race\r\nof illustrious men, by transmitting to us many of their portraits, to\r\nwhich he also lent his hand. To them we owe numerous duplicates of his\r\nmost celebrated pictures, which are scattered through Florence, and over\r\nall Italy; more especially of that Judith, so beautifully and\r\nmagnificently attired, which is a portrait of his mistress; while her\r\nmother appears in the character of Abra, and the head of Holofernes is\r\nthat of the painter, who permitted his beard to grow a considerable time\r\nfor this purpose. Zanobi Rosi lived to a later period, and finished some\r\npieces that were left imperfect by the death of Cristofano; but he never\r\nobtained the praise of invention. The name of Giovanni Batista Vanni is\r\nsuperior to any other scholar of the school of Allori. The Pisans claim\r\nhim as their countryman; Baldinucci assigns him to Florence. After\r\ntaking lessons from Empoli and other masters, he attended Allori for six\r\nyears; and whilst he imitated this master admirably in colouring, and\r\nrivalled him in design, he also imbibed his lessons of intemperance. Had\r\nhe conducted himself with more propriety, and adhered more to fixed\r\nprinciples, the genius he possessed might have raised him to more\r\ncelebrity. He visited the best schools of Italy, and copied on the spot,\r\nor at least designed, the choicest productions of each. Many praise some\r\nof his copies of Tiziano, of Correggio, and of Paolo Veronese: from the\r\nworks of the two last he likewise made etchings. Notwithstanding such\r\nstudies his colouring degenerated, and he became so much a mannerist,\r\nthat he has not left behind him a truly classical work. The S. Lorenzo\r\nin the church of S. Simone, which is reckoned the masterpiece of Vanni,\r\nhas nothing uncommon, except it be that the light of the fire invests\r\nthe spectators, and gives the picture novelty and surprising harmony.\r\n\r\nJacopo da Empoli, a scholar of Friano, retains in most of his works the\r\nstamp of his early education; but he adopted a second manner which is\r\nnot deficient in fulness of design, nor in elegance of colouring. Such\r\nis his S. Ivo, which, among painters of great name in a cabinet of the\r\nducal gallery, surprises most strangers more than the other pictures. He\r\nexecuted other works on similar principles, from which we might infer\r\nthat he belongs to an era favourable to the art. Painters cannot, like\r\nauthors, amend the first on a second edition of the same subject: their\r\nsecond editions, by which they should be judged, pass as other pictures\r\nsuperior to their first performances. Two of Jacopo's pictures in fresco\r\nare commended by Moreni (tom. ii. p. 113), one belonging to the Certosa,\r\nthe other to the monastery of Boldrone; both which prove the extent of\r\nhis ability in this branch of the art; but after the period of his fall\r\nfrom the scaffolding in the Certosa, he abandoned this method and\r\ndevoted himself wholly to painting in oil. Empoli gave all the beauty\r\nand fine effect of large works to those pleasing pictures he painted for\r\nprivate individuals, and in this style he was very successful.\r\n\r\nThis artist taught Vanni the principles of painting; but his greatest\r\npupil was Felice Ficherelli; a man of the most indolent disposition,\r\nlazy in every occupation, and, as if afraid of disturbing his tongue,\r\nusually silent unless when asked a question: hence he was named Felice\r\nRiposo by the Florentines. He executed few pictures; but what proceeded\r\nfrom his studio may be held up as an example of industry in the art;\r\nsimple, natural, and studied, without appearing to be so. There is a\r\npicture of S. Anthony by him in S. Maria Nuova, where he seems to have\r\nbeen directed by his intimate friend Cristofano, whose work it strongly\r\nresembles. He is rare in collections; but always makes a good figure\r\nthere by his graceful design, his full body of colouring, and his\r\nsoftness. The Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise, in the gallery of the\r\nRinuccini palace, is worthy such a collection. He copied Pietro\r\nPerugino, Andrea del Sarto, and some other masters so well, that his\r\nwork might pass for the originals; and to this employment we may chiefly\r\nattribute the exquisite finish of his pictures.\r\n\r\nTo this period we may assign some other artists, who, from whatever\r\ncause, are, perhaps, less commended by historians than they deserve. Of\r\nthis number is Giovanni Martinelli, of whom there is a capital work in\r\nthe Conventualists of Pescia, viz. the Miracle of S. Anthony, a subject\r\nmentioned a little above, as having been also executed by Cigoli. His\r\nFeast of Belshazzar, in the ducal gallery at Florence, and his Guardian\r\nAngel at S. Lucia de' Bardi, are pictures of note, but inferior to that\r\nat Pescia. Of the same class also is Michel Cinganelli, a scholar of\r\nPoccetti, who was employed in the metropolitan church of Pisa, where he\r\nornamented the corbels of the cupola, and strove to emulate the best\r\nTuscan artists of his age in an historical picture of Joshua. Such is\r\nPalladino, mentioned in the Guide of Florence in reference to a S.\r\nGiovanni Decollato; a work deserving notice, for its freedom from the\r\nbeaten track of his school. He seems to have studied the Lombard more\r\nthan native artists, and to have been acquainted with Baroccio. I saw\r\nhis altar-piece at S. Jacopo a' Corbolini. I suspect that this artist is\r\nthe same as Filippo Paladini, pointed out by Hackert, born and educated\r\nat Florence, and who resided in foreign parts. He was compelled to fly\r\nfrom Milan on account of some disturbance, and took refuge in Rome,\r\nwhere he was received by Prince Colonna, and being pursued he went to\r\nSicily, and resided at Mazzarino, an estate belonging to the Colonna\r\nfamily. There, as well as at Syracuse, Palermo, Catania, and elsewhere,\r\nhe left works that display much elegance and fine colouring, but not\r\nfree from mannerism, the fault also of the picture above cited at\r\nFlorence. Benedetto Veli painted in the cathedral of Pistoia an\r\nAscension of Christ, placed at the entrance to the presbytery, upon an\r\nimmense scale. It is the companion to one of the Pentecost by Gregorio\r\nPagani, which sufficiently proves that it has no common merit. There\r\nlived some other painters about this time, of whom Tuscany, as far as I\r\nknow, retains no trace; but they are recognized in other schools: thus\r\nVaiano is recognized in the Milanese, and Mazzoni in the Venetian\r\nschools, where we shall give some account of them.\r\n\r\nLast among the great masters of this period I place Matteo Rosselli, a\r\nscholar of Pagani and of Passignano, as likewise of several old masters,\r\nunder whom he studied assiduously at Rome and at Florence. He became so\r\ndistinguished a painter that he was invited to the court of the Duke of\r\nModena, and was retained by Cosmo II. Grand Duke of Tuscany, in his own\r\nservice. In painting, however, he had many equals; but very few in the\r\nart of teaching, for which he was adapted by a facility of communicating\r\ninstruction, a total want of envy, and a judicious method of discovering\r\nthe talents of each pupil, and of directing his progress: hence his\r\nschool, like that of the Caracci, produced as many different styles as\r\nhe had pupils. His placid genius was not fitted for the conception of\r\nnovel and daring compositions, nor for pursuing them with the steadiness\r\nthat characterizes the painter of elevated fancy. His merit lies in\r\ncorrectness in the imitation of nature; in which, however, he is not\r\nalways select; and there is a peculiar harmony and repose in the whole,\r\nby which his pictures (though they are generally in a sombre tone)\r\nplease, even when compared with works of the most lively and brilliant\r\ncolouring. He excels in dignity of character; some of the heads of his\r\napostles, to be seen in collections, so strongly resemble the works of\r\nthe Caracci, that connoisseurs are sometimes deceived. At times he\r\nstrove to rival Cigoli: as in his Nativity of our Saviour at S. Gaetano,\r\nwhich is thought to be his masterpiece, and in the Crucifixion of S.\r\nAndrew in All Saints church, which has been engraved at Florence. His\r\nfresco paintings are greatly admired: so well do his labours, on the\r\nprinciples of the past age, preserve their freshness and brilliancy. The\r\ncloister of the Nunziata has many of his semicircular pieces; and that\r\nrepresenting Alexander IV. confirming the Order of the Servi, appeared a\r\ngrand work to Passignano and Cortona. He ornamented a ceiling in the\r\nroyal villa of Poggio Imperiale with some histories of the Medicean\r\nfamily. The chamber where this painting was placed was ordered to be\r\ndemolished in the time of the Grand Duke Peter Leopold; but so highly\r\nwas Rosselli esteemed that the ceiling was preserved, and transferred to\r\nanother apartment. His chief praise, however, arises from his preserving\r\nthat fatherly regard for pupils, which Quintilian thinks the first\r\nrequisite in a master: hence he became the head of a respectable family\r\nof painters whom we shall now consider.\r\n\r\nGiovanni da S. Giovanni (this is the name of his native place; his\r\nfamily name was Manozzi), could boast of being one of the best fresco\r\npainters that Italy ever possessed. Gifted by nature with a fervid and\r\nbold genius, a lively and fertile imagination, celerity and freedom of\r\nhand, he painted so much in the dominions of the Church, and even in\r\nRome, especially in the church of the Four Saints, so much in Tuscany,\r\nin Florence, and even the Pitti palace,[216] we can scarcely believe\r\nthat he began to study at the age of eighteen, and died when only\r\nforty-eight years old. His style is very far from the solid manner of\r\nhis master; he carried the celebrated maxim of Horace \"_All is\r\nallowable_\" to excess; and in many of his works he preferred whim to\r\nart. Amid choirs of angels he introduced the singular novelty of female\r\nangels; if we may ascribe this to him, and not to the Cavalier d'Arpino\r\nor Alessandro Allori, as some are inclined to do. But whatever exertions\r\nhe made (if we may so express it) to discredit himself, he did not\r\nsucceed. His spirit is greatly superior to the conceits of other\r\nartists; and his performances at Florence, in which he bridled his\r\neccentricities, prove that he knew more than he was ambitious to shew.\r\nAmong these we may notice his Flight into Egypt in the royal academy,\r\nsome semicircular pieces in the church of All Saints, the Expulsion of\r\nthe Sciences from Greece, of the Pitti palace, in which the blind Homer\r\nappears groping his way with great nature, as he is exiled from his\r\nnative land. It is related of Pietro di Cortona, that on seeing some one\r\nof the works of Giovanni, which did him no credit, he did not therefore\r\ncondemn him; but, pointing to the piece, only observed, \"Giovanni\r\npainted that when he was already conscious of being a great man.\" His\r\npictures on panel and on canvass are less admired, nor are they always\r\nexempt from crudity. He had a son called Gio. Garzia, who produced\r\nseveral fresco works at Pistoia, tolerably well executed.\r\n\r\nBaldassare Franceschini, surnamed Volterrano, from the place of his\r\nnativity, and also the younger Volterrano, to distinguish him from\r\nRicciarelli, seemed to have been formed by nature to adorn cupolas,\r\ntemples, and magnificent halls, a style of work in which he is more\r\nconspicuous than in painting cabinet pictures. The cupola and nave of\r\nthe Niccolini chapel, in the church of the Holy Cross, is his happiest\r\neffort in this way; and surprises even an admirer of Lanfranco. That of\r\nthe Nunziata is most beautiful; and we must not omit the ceiling of a\r\nchapel in S. Maria Maggiore, where Elias appears so admirably\r\nforeshortened, that it calls to mind the S. Rocco of Tintoretto, by the\r\noptical illusion occasioned by it. His talents excited the envy of\r\nGiovanni da S. Giovanni, who having engaged him as his assistant in the\r\ndecoration of the Pitti palace, speedily dismissed him. His spirit is\r\ntempered by judgment and propriety; his Tuscan design is varied and\r\nennobled by an imitation of other schools; to visit which, he was sent\r\nto travel for some months by his noble patrons of the house of\r\nNiccolini. He derived great advantages from studying the schools of\r\nParma and of Bologna. He knew Pietro di Cortona, and adopted some of his\r\nprinciples, which was a thing not uncommon among the artists of this\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nVolterrano painted a great many frescos in Florence, one in the Palazzo\r\ndel Bufalo at Rome, and some at Volterra, that are noticed by\r\nBaldinucci. The praise bestowed on him by the historian appears rather\r\nscanty than extravagant to those who duly consider the propriety of his\r\ninventions, the correctness of his design, qualities so rare in this\r\nclass of artists, his knowledge of the perspective, of foreshortening\r\nfigures in ceilings,[217] the spirit of his attitudes, the clearness of\r\nhis graduated, well balanced, and properly united colours, and the\r\npleasing and quiet harmony of the whole. The same talents are\r\nproportionally evident in his oil pictures, as may be observed in his S.\r\nFilippo Benizi, in the Nunziata of Florence; in his S. John the\r\nEvangelist, a noble figure which he painted along with other saints in\r\nS. Chiara at Volterra; his S. Carlo administering the communion to those\r\nsick of the plague, in the Nunziata of Pescia, and some of his other\r\npaintings that are well finished, which was not the case with all his\r\nworks. The same observations apply to his cabinet pictures, which abound\r\nin the ducal palace, and in the houses of the nobility of Volterra,\r\nespecially in those of the families of Maffei and Sermolli.\r\n\r\nCosimo Ulivelli is also a good historical painter; and his style is\r\nsometimes mistaken for that of his master by less skilful judges; but a\r\ngood connoisseur discovers in him forms less elegant, a colouring less\r\nstrong and clear, a character approaching to mannerism and to\r\nmeagreness. We ought to form an opinion from the works of his best\r\nperiod, such as his semicircular pieces in the cloister of the Carmine.\r\nAntonio Franchi, a native of Lucca, who lived at Florence, is reckoned\r\nby many inferior to Ulivelli; but he is generally more judicious, if I\r\ndo not mistake, and more diligent. His S. Joseph of Calassanzio, in the\r\nchurch of the Fathers of Scolopi, is a picture of good effect, and is\r\ncommended also for the design. Another of his fine works is in the\r\nparish church of Caporgnano, in the state of Lucca; it represents Christ\r\ndelivering the keys to S. Peter, and I am informed by an experienced\r\nartist that it is the most esteemed of his productions; many more of\r\nwhich may be found in the account of his Life, published at Florence, by\r\nBartolozzi. He was painter to the court, by which he was much employed,\r\nas well as by private individuals. He was a moderate follower of\r\nCortona. He wrote a useful tract on the _Theory of Painting_, in which\r\nhe combated the prejudices of the age, and enforced the necessity of\r\nproceeding on general principles. It was printed in 1739; and afterwards\r\ndefended by the author against certain criticisms made on it. Giuseppe\r\nand Margherita, his two sons, have met with some commendation, and I am\r\ntold there is a fine altar-piece by the former, which adorns the parish\r\nchurch at Borgo Buggiano. It is retouched, however, by his father, who\r\nhonourably makes mention of the fact. I repeat, honourably; because many\r\nfathers are known to have aided their sons with a view of obtaining for\r\nthem a reputation beyond their deserts. Michelangiolo Palloni da Campi,\r\na pupil of Volterrano, is well known in Florence by a good copy of the\r\nFurius Camillus, of Salviati, in the old palace; which was placed by the\r\nside of the original. He resided long, and was much employed in Poland.\r\nAn eminent pupil of Baldassare, named Benedetto Orsi, was omitted by\r\nBaldinucci. A fine picture of S. John the Evangelist, in the church of\r\nS. Stephen, at Pescia, his native place, is attributed to him. He also\r\npainted the Works of Mercy, for the religious fraternity of nobles.\r\nThese oil paintings were shewn to strangers among the curiosities of\r\nthat city; but they were dispersed on the suppression of the order.\r\nThere still exists a large circular picture which he produced at Pistoia\r\nfor S. Maria del Letto, enumerated by good judges among the finest works\r\nof Volterrano, until an authentic document discovered the real author.\r\nLast in this list I have to mention Arrighi, the fellow citizen of\r\nFranceschini, and his favourite pupil. He has nothing remaining in\r\npublic, in which his master cannot boast a great share.[218]\r\n\r\nAfter Franceschini, who may be considered the Lanfranco of the Rosselli,\r\nor rather Florentine school, we proceed to Francesco Furini, who is its\r\nGuido and its Albano. Foreigners recognized him as such: hence he was\r\ninvited to Venice, for the express purpose of painting a Thetis, as a\r\ncompanion to an Europa by Guido Reni. He had seen the works of masters\r\nof this class at Rome, and appears to have aspired at rivalling, rather\r\nthan at imitating them. His ideas certainly do not seem borrowed from\r\nthem, nor from any other artists. He spent a long time in meditating on\r\nhis subject, and was accustomed to consider his picture completed when\r\nhe had finished his studies for it; so little time and trouble did it\r\ncost him to embody his ideas in colours. Having been ordained a priest\r\nabout his fortieth year, and becoming curate of S. Ansano in Mugello, he\r\nexecuted some pictures truly valuable, both on account of the rarity of\r\nhis works and their excellence, for the neighbouring town of S. Lorenzo.\r\nAbove all, we may notice with admiration a S. Francis receiving the\r\nStigmata, and a Conception of the Blessed Virgin, in which, elevated\r\nabove mortality, she appears soaring and resplendent. But his great name\r\nin Italy arose from his cabinet pictures, which are rare out of\r\nFlorence, and in Florence are highly esteemed, though considerable\r\nnumbers of them remain there. His Hylas carried away by the Nymphs,\r\nwhich he painted for the family of Galli, and in which he introduced\r\nnoble figures that are grandly varied, is highly celebrated; not to\r\nmention the three Graces of the Strozzi palace, and the many historical\r\npieces and half-length figures dispersed through the city that are\r\nunnoticed in his life. They chiefly consist of nymphs, or of Magdalens,\r\nno less naked than the nymphs; for Furini was a very expert painter of\r\ndelicate flesh, but not one of the most modest. Furini must have had a\r\ngreat number either of pupils or imitators, as his pictures for private\r\nhouses before mentioned, which were copied, are of frequent occurrence\r\nin Florence. They are often of a dusky hue, through the defect of their\r\nground, and Simone Pignone is made, often erroneously so, their most\r\ncommon author. He was Francesco's best pupil; very delicate in the\r\ncolours of his fleshes, as we may judge from the altar-piece of B.\r\nBernardo Tolomei, at Monte Oliveto, where the Virgin and the Infant are\r\ncoloured very beautifully in the flesh, if not handsome in their\r\nfeatures. His picture of St. Louis, king of France, at S. Felicita, is\r\nstill more celebrated. It was much commended by Giordano, and the artist\r\nreceived five hundred crowns for its execution. In the first volume of\r\nLettere Pittoriche we are informed, that Maratta only esteemed Gabbiani\r\nand Pignone among all the Florentine painters of his time. He was also\r\npraised by Bellini in the work entitled _Bucchereide_, where he coins a\r\nnew term for Pignone, (a liberty extremely common among our jocose\r\npoets,) I know not how far susceptible of imitation in another tongue:\r\n\"_E l'arcipittorissimo de' buoni_.\"\r\n\r\nLorenzo Lippi, like his friend Salvator Rosa, divided his hours between\r\npoetry and painting. His Malmantile Racquistato,[219] which is a model\r\nof Tuscan purity of language,[220] is a work less read perhaps, but more\r\nelegant than the satires of Salvator; and is sprinkled with those\r\ngraceful Florentine idioms that are regarded as the Attic salt of Italy.\r\nIn looking for a prototype among the artists of his own school, guided\r\nby similarity of genius, he made choice of Santi di Tito. A delineator\r\nof the passions sufficiently accorded with the genius of the poet, and a\r\npainter of the choicest design was highly congenial to so elegant a\r\nwriter. He, however, added to his style a greater force of colouring;\r\nand in drapery he followed the practice of some Lombard masters and of\r\nBaroccio, in modelling the folds in paper, a practice of which their\r\nworks retain some traces. The delicacy of pencil, the clearness,\r\nharmony, and to sum up all, the good taste, pervading his pictures,\r\ndemonstrate that he had a feeling of natural beauty superior to most of\r\nhis contemporaries. His master admired him, and said, with a liberality\r\nnot always to be found among history painters, \"Lorenzo, thou art more\r\nknowing than I.\" His pictures are not very rare at Florence, although he\r\nresided far from it for many years, for he was painter to the court of\r\nInspruck. A Crucifixion, among his best performances, is in the ducal\r\ngallery. The noble family of Arrighi possesses a S. Saverio recovering\r\nfrom the claws of a crab, the Crucifix which he had dropped into the\r\nsea. Baldinucci and the author of _The Series of the most Illustrious\r\nPainters_ have spoken very highly of his Triumph of David, painted for\r\nthe hall of Angiol Gaddi, who wished him to represent his eldest son as\r\nthe son of Jesse, and his other sixteen children as the youths and\r\nvirgins, that with songs and timbrels greet the victor, and hail the\r\ndeliverance of Israel. In this celebrated piece, the artist was enabled\r\nto give full scope to his talent for portrait painting, and to the style\r\napproaching to nature, which he loved, without troubling himself about\r\nstudied and artful embellishments. It was his maxim to write poetry as\r\nhe spoke, and to paint what he observed.\r\n\r\nMario Balassi perfected himself under Passignano, and after the choicest\r\nexamples of the Roman and other schools. He was an excellent copyist of\r\nthe old masters, and a painter of invention above mediocrity. Some of\r\nhis small historical pictures, and a few pieces representing eatables,\r\nare to be met with in private houses; and, above all, there are many of\r\nhis half-length figures finely coloured and relieved. In his old age he\r\nchanged his manner, and retouched as many of the works of his youth as\r\nhe could lay his hands on; but in striving to improve, he only injured\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Boschi, the nephew and scholar of Rosselli, was an excellent\r\nportrait painter. In the cloister of All Saints, where his uncle\r\nFabrizio also painted, there are some of his portraits that seem\r\nabsolutely alive, and are executed in fresco so admirably, that they\r\nclearly shew the school from which he proceeded. He finished some pieces\r\nin oil, that were left imperfect by the death of Rosselli, and painted\r\nothers entirely his own, the subjects of which were chiefly religious,\r\nwhere the countenances are strikingly expressive of probity and\r\nsanctity. As he grew older he assumed the ecclesiastical habit, and\r\nsustained its dignity by his exemplary conduct, the account of which\r\nBaldinucci has extended at some length. During twenty-four years in\r\nwhich he lived a priest, he did not resign his pencil; but he employed\r\nit less frequently, and generally less successfully, than in his youth.\r\nHis elder brother Alfonso promised much, and even attained a great deal,\r\nthough cut off in early life.\r\n\r\nThe style of Jacopo Vignali has some resemblance to that of Guercino,\r\nbut less in the forms than in the dark shadows and the grounds. He is\r\namongst those scholars of Rosselli who are seldom mentioned, although he\r\npainted more than any of the rest for the prince and the state. He often\r\nis weak, especially in attitude; often, however, he appears\r\npraiseworthy, as in the two pictures at S. Simone, and in the S.\r\nLiborio, which is possessed by the Missionaries. He is most conspicuous\r\nin fresco painting, with which he ornamented the chapel of the\r\nBonarruoti. He painted good historical pictures in the palaces of many\r\nof the nobility, and he even boasts noble pupils, none of whom did so\r\nmuch honour to his memory as Carlo Dolci.\r\n\r\nDolci holds the same rank in the Florentine, that Sassoferrato holds in\r\nthe Roman school. Both, though destitute of great powers of invention,\r\nobtained great reputation for Madonnas and similar small subjects, which\r\nhave now become extremely valuable; for the wealthy, desirous of\r\npossessing pictures, at once estimable and religious, to hang up in\r\ntheir oratories, have brought those two masters into great request,\r\nnotwithstanding that they operated on very different principles. Carlo\r\nis not so celebrated for beauty, (for he was like his master, a mere\r\n_naturalist_,) as for the exquisite pains with which he finished every\r\nthing, and the genuine expression of certain affecting emotions; such as\r\nthe patient suffering of Christ, or of the Virgin Mary; the penitential\r\ncompunction of a Saint, or the holy confidence of a Martyr devoting\r\nhimself as a victim for the living God. The colouring and general tone\r\nof his pictures accord with the idea of the passion; nothing is turgid\r\nor bold; all is modesty, repose, and placid harmony. In him we may\r\nretrace the manner of Rosselli brought to perfection, as we sometimes\r\ncan view the features of the grandsire in his descendants. A few of his\r\nlarger works still remain, such as the S. Antonio, in the royal museum;\r\nthe Conception of our Lady, in the possession of the Marquis Rinuccini;\r\nalso a very few of his subjects from profane story, a few of his\r\nportraits, and the celebrated figure of Poetry in the palace of Prince\r\nCorsini. His small pictures, for each of which he usually received 100\r\ncrowns, are very numerous; and were frequently repeated by himself or by\r\nhis pupils, Alessandro Lomi and Bartolommeo Mancini; and often by Agnese\r\nDolci, his daughter, a good artist and follower of the style of her\r\nfather; but not his equal. His two Madonnas in the cabinet of the Grand\r\nDuke, and his martyrdom of S. Andrew, in the possession of the Marquis\r\nGerini, have been often copied.\r\n\r\nOf Onorio Marinari, the cousin and scholar of Carlo, but few pictures\r\nremain at Florence, either in private or in public. After imitating his\r\nmaster, (which usually is the first exercise of students in the art, and\r\noften, from dissimilarity of genius, is their great bane,) he formed\r\nanother style, by yielding to the bent of his natural powers; which was\r\nmore grand, had more of the ideal, and deeper shadows; and of this\r\nseveral specimens remain in the churches of S. Maria Maggiore, and S.\r\nSimone. This artist died young, very unfortunately for the school to\r\nwhich he belonged.\r\n\r\nAbout the period we have been describing, some foreign artists resided\r\nat Florence for a considerable time, to the no small advantage of the\r\nnative painters, as we have already observed. Paggi came there in the\r\nreign of the Grand Duke Francis I., remained there twenty years, and\r\nleft some works behind him. About the same time Salvator Rosa, Albani,\r\nBorgognone, Colonna, Mitelli, and many more, either invited by the\r\nprinces from abroad, or coming there of their own accord, were retained\r\nby them for the decoration of the palace and the city. We shall consider\r\nthem particularly under the schools of the countries where they were\r\nborn, or in which they taught; but here we shall give a place to Jacopo\r\nLigozzi, whom the Florentine school may claim on account of his\r\nresidence, his employment, and his scholars. He had studied at Verona\r\nunder Paolo Veronese, according to Baldinucci; but under Gio. Francesco\r\nCarrotto, according to the emendation of Maffei, without reflecting that\r\nthis artist died when Jacopo was scarcely three years old. Some foreign\r\nwriters make him the son of Gio. Ermanno, the painter; a circumstance\r\nunknown to Cav. del Pozzo, the townsman and historian of them both.\r\nFerdinand II. appointed him painter to the court, and superintendant of\r\nthe gallery. This was very honourable, when conferred by such a prince\r\non him, in preference to many eminent Florentines. Ligozzi executed some\r\nworks at Rome, and introduced at Florence a freedom of pencil, an art in\r\ncomposition, a taste for the ornamental, and a grace and gaiety, till\r\nthen rare in that city. His design was sufficiently correct, and\r\nuniformly improved while he remained in Tuscany. As to his colouring,\r\nalthough it was not that of Paolo, it was not deficient in truth and\r\nvigour.\r\n\r\nHis seventeen semicircular pictures in the cloisters of All Saints, are\r\nvalued at Florence; especially the interview between S. Francis and S.\r\nDomenick, the founders of the order. On this picture he wrote, _To the\r\nconfusion of our friends_, meaning the envious and malignant. This is\r\nhis masterpiece in fresco. He painted more frequently in oil colours in\r\nseveral churches. The S. Raymond in the act of reanimating a child, in\r\nS. Maria Novella, is a picture full of art; and there is another in the\r\nsame style at the Scalzi of Imola, representing the four Crowned Saints.\r\nThe martyrdom of S. Dorothea, I do not hesitate to call a wonderful\r\npicture; in which we recognize a follower of Paolo, and which is in\r\npossession of the Conventual Friars of Pescia. The scaffold, the\r\nexecutioner, the Prefect on horseback who is ordering him to strike, the\r\ngreat crowd of spectators variously affected, and all the apparatus of a\r\npublic punishment, strike and astonish equally the connoisseur and the\r\nunskilled in painting; the holy martyr especially interests us, who, on\r\nher knees, with a placid composure, willingly resigns her life, and is\r\nabout to receive from angels the eternal crown purchased with her blood.\r\nIn other performances he shews more simplicity, as in the S. Diego at\r\nAll Saints, or in the Angels at the P. P. Scolopi; but he is an artist\r\nwho always pleases, and who shews that he felt what he painted. Ligozzi\r\npainted much for private individuals. In his very small pictures, a\r\nstyle in which he was expert, he finished as highly as if they were\r\nminiatures. Several of his works were published by Agostino Caracci, and\r\nother engravers.\r\n\r\nNone of his Florentine pupils is esteemed equal to Donato Mascagni, for\r\nsuch was his real name, which may be seen subscribed to two Scriptural\r\npieces, in possession of Sig. Ab. Giachi, at Volterra. Having entered\r\nthe order of Servi, he assumed the name of Fra Arsenio; and several of\r\nhis works painted after that period are to be seen in Florence, executed\r\nin a manner not very full and soft, but diligent; of which there are\r\nseveral other specimens in his Miracles of the Nunziata, which are\r\nengraved and illustrated in the little work of Padre Lottini. What does\r\nhim greatest honour is the picture preserved in the library of the\r\nmonastery of Vallombrosa. It represents the donation of the State of\r\nFerrara to the Holy Seat, by the Countess Matilda, as is believed by\r\nsome, or rather the distribution of some privileges by her to the order\r\nof Vallombrosa, and is a picture full of subject, and the chief glory of\r\nthis master.\r\n\r\nIn casting our eyes over other cities of Tuscany, we find some painters\r\nvery capable of decorating houses and altars. Francesco Morosini,\r\nsurnamed Montepulciano, may be recognized in the church of S. Stephen,\r\nof Florence, where he painted a Conversion of S. Paul, in the manner of\r\nhis master Fidani. Arezzo produced the two Santini. Of one of them,\r\nthere named the Elder, several pictures were pointed out to me by the\r\naccomplished Cav. Giudici; among which was a S. Catherine, in possession\r\nof the Conventual Friars: it savours of the Florentine manner during\r\nthis epoch; except that the use of changing tints is more frequent.\r\nBartolommeo and Teofilo Torre, of Arezzo, are noticed as fresco painters\r\nby Orlandi, who mentions halls, and even whole houses, being ornamented\r\nby the latter with historical pieces; which, if deficient in design, he\r\npraises for their colouring. Francesco Brini left a good picture of the\r\nImmaculate Conception, at Volterra: of his country and school I am\r\nignorant. I do not know the master of Pompeo Caccia; it is certain that\r\nhe called himself a native of Rome, perhaps because it is easy to\r\nsubstitute the capital, so well known, for places in the state of less\r\nnotoriety. In Rome, however, I do not find any traces of him. I find,\r\nindeed, that he left several pictures at Pistoja; among which is\r\nthe Presentation (at the Selesiane) of Jesus in the Temple, to which is\r\naffixed the date 1615. Alessandro Bardelli was a native of Pescia; in\r\nhis style we find traces of his preceptor Curradi and of Guercino. He\r\nwas a good painter, and executed the ornamental border for the portrait\r\nof S. Francis, painted by Margaritone, for his church in Pescia: he\r\nrepresented around it the virtues of the Saint, and a choir of Angels\r\nabove. I am doubtful whether we should include Alessio Gimignani, one of\r\na family of artists in Pistoia, to be recorded in the fifth epoch, among\r\nthe pupils of Ligozzi, but he was undoubtedly his follower.\r\n\r\nAbout this period two schools arose, highly deserving of notice, those\r\nof Pisa and of Lucca. The Pisan school recognizes as its founder,\r\nAurelio Lomi, first a scholar of Bronzino, and afterwards of Cigoli. His\r\nvery correct performances, in the cathedral of Pisa, are executed after\r\nboth masters; but when compared to Cigoli he is more minute, and has\r\nmuch less softness. His aim appears to be to surprise the multitude by\r\nan agreeable colouring, and a magnificence of draperies and ornaments.\r\nThis style pleased at Florence, in Rome, and more especially at Genoa,\r\nwhere he was preferred to Sorri, many years established and in good\r\nrepute. His works in that city are very full of subject; as his S.\r\nAnthony, belonging to the Franciscans, and his Last Judgment, in S.\r\nMaria of Carignano; pictures which surprise by an air of novelty: the\r\nfirst is graceful, rich, but modest in the tints; the second terrible,\r\nand the colours more vivid than those he employed on any other occasion.\r\nA S. Jerome, in the Campo Santo, is less glowing, but it is esteemed by\r\nthe Pisans his capital work; at the bottom of this piece he put his\r\ninitials and the date 1595.\r\n\r\nHe most probably taught the principles of the art to his brother, Orazio\r\nLomi; who was called Gentileschi, from the surname of an uncle.\r\nGentileschi formed his style, however, on the finest examples in Rome,\r\nassisted by his friend Agostino Tassi. Tassi was an eminent ornamental\r\nlandscape painter, and Gentileschi executed appropriate figures to his\r\ninventions in the Loggia Rospigliosi, in the saloon of the Quirinal\r\npalace, and in other places. He also painted some smaller pictures in\r\nRome, particularly at the Pace, from which we cannot ascertain his\r\nmerit, either because they were performances of his unripe years, or\r\nbecause they have become black from age. He had not then attained the\r\nbeautiful colouring, nor the Lombard-like manner of managing the\r\nshadows, which we observe in many of his cabinet pictures. A fine\r\nspecimen, representing S. Cecilia with S. Valerian, is in the Borghesi\r\npalace. The choicest adorn the royal palace of Turin, and some houses in\r\nGenoa. In the collection of his Excellency Cardinal Cambiasi, there is a\r\nDavid standing over the dead Goliath; so relieved, and with tints so\r\nvivid and so well contrasted, that it gives the idea of a style entirely\r\nnew. He was esteemed by Vandyck, and inserted by him in his series of\r\nportraits of one hundred illustrious men. When already old he went to\r\nthe English court, where he died at the age of eighty-four.\r\n\r\nArtemisia, his daughter and disciple, followed her father into that\r\nisland; but she passed her best years in Italy. She was respected for\r\nher talents, and celebrated for the elegance of her manners and\r\nappearance. She is noticed both by Italian and foreign writers, and by\r\nWalpole among the latter, in his _Anecdotes of Painting in England_. She\r\nlived long at Naples, married there a Pier Antonio Schiattesi; and was\r\nthere assisted and improved in the art by Guido Reni, studied the works\r\nof Domenichino, and was not unskilled in other approved styles. She\r\nshews variety of style in her few remaining historical pictures. Some of\r\nthem are at Naples and Pozzuolo, and there are two in Florence inscribed\r\nwith her name; one in the ducal gallery, and the other in possession of\r\nmy noble and learned friend Sig. Averardo de' Medici; the former\r\nrepresenting Judith slaying Holofernes, is a picture of a strong\r\ncolouring, of a tone and perspicuity that inspires awe; the latter, a\r\nSusanna and the Elders, is a painting that pleases by the scene, the\r\nelegance of the principal figure, and the drapery of the others.\r\nArtemisia, however, was more celebrated for her portraits, which are of\r\nsingular merit; they spread her fame over all Europe, and in them she\r\nsurpassed her father.\r\n\r\nOrazio Riminaldi was a scholar of the elder Lomi in Pisa, and of the\r\nyounger in Rome, but imitated neither of them; from the beginning he\r\ngave himself up to the guidance of Manfredi, in the manner of\r\nCaravaggio, and afterwards became a follower of Domenico Zampieri, to\r\nrival whom he seems intended by nature. From the time that the art of\r\npainting revived in Pisa, that city had not perhaps so eminent a\r\npainter, nor have many better been born on the banks of the Arno, a soil\r\nso propitious to the arts. Grand in contour and in drapery, after the\r\nmanner of the Caracci, pleasing and agreeable in his carnations, full,\r\nfree, and delicate in the management of his pencil, he would have been\r\nfaultless, had not the wretched style of engraving raised prejudices\r\nagainst him. Excessive fatigue, or, as others will have it, the plague\r\nof 1630, snatched him in early life from his country; for the fame of\r\nwhich alone he seems to have lived to maturity. He there ornamented many\r\naltars with fine pictures, one of which representing the martyrdom of S.\r\nCecilia, was afterwards placed in the Pitti palace. In the choir of the\r\ncathedral there are two of his scriptural pieces, that form a perfect\r\nstudy for any one who wishes to become acquainted with this epoch. The\r\njudgment of the master of the works was conspicuous in engaging\r\nRiminaldi to paint the cupola, even before he had finished the above\r\npictures, and in making choice of him in preference to any other artist.\r\nThe Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which he painted in oil, is one of\r\nthe best conceived and most perfect works that Tuscany had ever beheld,\r\nand it was the last labour of Orazio. His brother Girolamo completed it\r\nfeebly, by introducing some figures that were wanting, and the family\r\nreceived 5,000 crowns as its price. Girolamo is rarely to be met with in\r\nPisan collections, and still more rarely in other places. He was,\r\nhowever, well known in his day, having been invited to Naples to\r\nornament the chapel of S. Gennaro, and to the court of Paris by the\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nFrom among many Pisan artists of this period recorded by Sig. da\r\nMorrona, or Sig. Tempesti, we shall select some of the most\r\nconsiderable. Ercole Bezzicaluva is worthy of notice, both for his\r\nengravings and his picture representing various saints in the choir of\r\nSt. Stephen's at Pisa. So likewise is Gio. del Sordo, otherwise called\r\nMone da Pisa; but his colouring seems superior to his invention.\r\nZaccaria Rondinosi, I believe, of the Florentine school, was more\r\nskilled in ornamental than in any other branch of painting. He repaired\r\nthe pictures in the Campo Santo, and on that account was honoured by the\r\ncitizens with a tomb there, and near it an inscription on the marble. I\r\nknow not whether any picture of Arcangela Paladini, an excellent\r\nembroiderer, except her own portrait, has reached our times. It was hung\r\nin the ducal gallery among the portraits of illustrious painters: to be\r\ndeposited in such a place, and to remain there from 1621, is an\r\nunequivocal proof of its merit; since it is the custom of the place not\r\nlightly to refuse the portraits of tolerably good painters, but to keep\r\nthem there as if only lodgers, and then send them to some villa of the\r\nprince, when new guests arrive, to take a place in the cabinets which\r\nare named _de' Pittori_. Gio. Stefano Marucelli, both an engineer and a\r\npainter, was not born in Pisa, but he may be reckoned a Pisan from his\r\nlong residence and attachment to the place. Having come from Umbria into\r\nTuscany, according to the tradition of the Pisans, he became a pupil of\r\nBoscoli, and remaining at Pisa, he contended with the celebrated artists\r\nwhom we have noticed as employed from time to time in ornamenting the\r\ntribune of the cathedral. The Abraham entertaining the three angels is a\r\nwork of his, commended for felicity of invention, and beauty of\r\ncolouring. In the church of S. Nicolas at Pisa, there remains a memorial\r\nof Domenico Bongi of Pietrasanta, who was a follower of Perino del Vaga.\r\nHe flourished in 1582.\r\n\r\nThe series of the principal artists of Lucca commences with Paol\r\nBiancucci, the best scholar of Guido Reni, whose grace and full power of\r\ncolour he has imitated in many of his works. He sometimes so strongly\r\nresembles Sassoferrato as to be mistaken for him. The Purgatory which he\r\npainted at Suffragio, the picture representing various saints which he\r\nleft at the church of S. Francis, two in possession of the noble family\r\nof Boccella, and many others scattered over the city, are of such merit,\r\nthat Malvasia should have noticed him among the pupils of Guido, which\r\nhe has not done. He has also omitted Pietro Ricchi of Lucca, who went to\r\nBologna from the school of Passignano. It is true that the preceptorship\r\nof Guido is in this instance doubtful, though Baldinucci and Orlandi\r\nboth assert it: for Boschini, who was his intimate friend, says not a\r\nword upon the matter, merely observing that Ricchi regretted he had not\r\nstudied in Venice. It is certain he frequently imitated the forms of\r\nGuido; but in colouring and design adhered to the manner of Passignano;\r\nhe also imbibed the principles of the Venetian school, as we shall\r\nrelate in the proper place. Two of his pictures are preserved at the\r\nchurch of S. Francis in Lucca, and some others remain in private hands;\r\nsmall remains of a genius very fertile in invention, and of a hand most\r\nrapid and almost indefatigable in execution. He painted in several\r\ncities of France, in the Milanese, and still more in the Venetian\r\nstates, where he died at Udine, in the MS. guide to which place he is\r\noften named.\r\n\r\nPietro Paolini long lived and taught at Lucca; he was a pupil of the\r\nRoman school, as history informs us; but to judge from his works one\r\nwould pronounce him of the Venetian. In Rome he frequented the study of\r\nAngelo Caroselli, who was by education a follower of Caravaggio, but\r\nexceedingly expert in copying and imitating every style. Under him\r\nPaolini acquired a manner that shews good drawing, broad shadows, and\r\nfirm touches, compared by some to the style of Titian, and by others to\r\nthat of Pordenone: one also remarks in his works undoubted imitations of\r\nVeronese. The martyrdom of S. Andrew, that exists at S. Michele, and the\r\ngrand picture, sixteen cubits long, preserved in the library of S.\r\nFrediano, would be sufficient to immortalize a painter. In this he\r\nrepresented the pontiff S. Gregory, entertaining some pilgrims; it is a\r\nmagnificent picture, ornamented in the style of Veronese, with plate and\r\narchitectural perspective, full of figures, and possessing a variety,\r\nharmony, and beauty, that have induced many poets to extol it as a\r\nwonderful production. His cabinet pictures of conversations and rural\r\nfestivals, which are not rare at Lucca, are exquisite. Two, of the\r\nMassacre of Valdestain, belonging to the Orsetti family, were especially\r\ncommended by Baldinucci. The historian remarks that he had a particular\r\ntalent for such tragic themes, and in general for the energetic; he\r\nadmires him less in the delicate, and even accuses him of marking the\r\naction of his female figures too strongly. That he could however be very\r\npleasing when he inclined, we are led to believe from his large work in\r\nthe church of the Trinity; which he is said to have conducted in this\r\ngraceful style, to demonstrate that he was not inferior to his rival\r\nBiancucci.\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain whether Pietro Testa, called at Rome Il Lucchesino, was\r\nhis disciple; but it appears highly probable, when his age is compared\r\nwith that of Paolini, that he learnt from the latter the principles of\r\nthe art, which he had undoubtedly acquired in Lucca before he came to\r\nRome. He there had several masters, and was chiefly under Pietro da\r\nCortona, from whose school he was expelled, because he treated the\r\nmaxims of the master with contempt. He then put himself under\r\nDomenichino, on whose principles, says Passeri, he gloried to rely; but\r\nhis style, in his own despite, at times approaches nearly to that of\r\nCortona. He has also some resemblance to his friend Poussin, both in his\r\nfigures (which at one time he made too slender), in his landscapes, and\r\nin his study of the antique, of which he was deeply enamoured; having\r\napplied himself to designing the finest specimens in architecture and in\r\nsculpture that Rome afforded. In this branch he is excellent. The death\r\nof B. Angelo, placed in S. Martino a' Monti, a picture of great force,\r\nis the only piece before the public. Testa is more frequently recognized\r\nin galleries: there is a Joseph sold to the Ishmaelites by him in the\r\ncapitol; a Murder of the Innocents, in the Spada palace; but there are\r\nnot many of his pictures elsewhere; for he engraved more than he\r\npainted.[221] He left some oil paintings at Lucca, one in a feeble style\r\nat S. Romano, several at S. Paolino, in the Buonvisi gallery, and in\r\nother places, in his best manner. Two of his works in fresco remain\r\nthere; viz. the allegorical picture of Liberty in the senate house, and\r\nthe small very elegant cupola of the oratory in the Lippi palace. He\r\nsettled at Rome, where he lived unhappily, and either from despair, or\r\nsome affront, drowned himself in the Tiber. His fate may teach young\r\nartists of genius not to overrate their own talents, nor to despise\r\nthose of others. By these failings, Testa alienated the minds of his\r\ncontemporaries, so that neither in reputation nor in employment was he\r\nso successful as many others; and his perpetual complaints occasioned\r\ndoubts even of his sanity.\r\n\r\nOmitting some scholars of Paolini less addicted to his manner, we shall\r\nnotice the three brothers, Cassiano, Francesco, and Simone del Tintore.\r\nI find nothing recorded of the first that exalts him above mediocrity;\r\nand when one meets with an indifferent picture of the school of Paolini,\r\nit is ascribed to Cassiano, or some such pupil; or sometimes to the\r\ndotage of Paolini, when he produced sketches rather than paintings.\r\nFrancesco is recognized as an able artist in the Visitation, in the\r\napartments of his excellency the Gonfaloniere; and in some pieces in the\r\nMotroni collection. Simone was expert in depicting birds, fruit, and\r\nother objects in the inferior walks of the art, to which, as I usually\r\ndo at the end of each epoch, I shall here devote a few pages.\r\n\r\nAnd to pursue this pleasing branch of painting, I may observe that\r\nAngiol Gori and Bartolommeo Bimbi of Florence, distinguished themselves\r\nin fruit, and more especially in flowers: the second was the scholar of\r\nthe first in this line, and of Lippi in figures. Lippi himself induced\r\nAndrea Scacciati to abandon figures for fruit and flowers, and animals,\r\nin which department he succeeded well, and sent many pictures into\r\nforeign countries. Bimbi was the Mario of his school. He instructed\r\nFortini, whom we shall notice by and by along with Moro, a painter of\r\nflowers and animals. All these gave place to Lopez of Naples, who\r\nvisited Florence in his journeys through Italy, and shall be afterwards\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe art of painting landscapes, and their introduction into collections,\r\nbegan during this epoch: the first style that became fashionable at\r\nFlorence was that of Adriano Fiammingo: but Cristofano Allori excelled\r\nall by the neat and firm touch of his pencil, and by the exquisite\r\nfigures which he introduced into his landscapes. Guasparre Falgani\r\nsurpassed him in the number of such subjects: he was initiated in the\r\nart by Valerio Marucelli, and imitated by Giovanni Rosi, and Benedetto\r\nBoschi, the brother and fellow student of Francesco. The landscapes of\r\nthis age have often their greens changed into black; and are reckoned of\r\nthe old school by Baldinucci. The new style was introduced into Florence\r\nby Filippo d'Angeli, or Philip the Neapolitan, who was long retained at\r\nthe court of Cosmo II; but chiefly by Salvator Rosa. This artist was\r\nbrought to Florence by Cardinal Gio. Carlo, and remained there for seven\r\nyears; where in the capacity of painter, poet, and author of comedies,\r\nhe was constantly applauded for his fine genius, and his society courted\r\nby men of learning; with whom, in every department of letters, the\r\ncountry then abounded. He formed no pupils at that place, but many young\r\nmen there became his copyists and imitators; as Taddeo Baldini, Lorenzo\r\nMartelli, and many others. Antonio Giusti, a pupil of Cesare Dandini,\r\nwas particularly skilled in this art; but he likewise practised every\r\nother branch of painting; and Orlandi has described him as an universal\r\npainter. Signor da Morrona notices the Poli, two brothers, who executed\r\nmany pleasing landscapes, which are known in the collections of Florence\r\nand of Pisa.\r\n\r\nPassing from landscape to sea-views, I do not find any Tuscan who in\r\nthis respect equalled Pietro Ciafferi, otherwise called Lo\r\nSmargiasso,[222] and recorded among the Pisan artists. It is said that\r\nhe resided long at Leghorn, a place well suited to his genius. He there\r\ndecorated facades of houses with disembarkations and naval enterprizes;\r\nand of such subjects, ports, sea-coasts, and ships, he composed oil\r\npaintings, that are usually highly finished, and ornamented with small\r\nfigures, well designed and fancifully draped. He likewise succeeded\r\ngreatly in architectural views. Leghorn and Pisa are rich in his easel\r\npictures; and one in possession of Sig. Decano Zucchetti of this place\r\nbears the name of the artist and the date 1651.\r\n\r\nPerspective was much cultivated at Florence about this period; and the\r\nBolognese had carried it to a degree of excellence, that will claim\r\nattention in the proper place. Lessons in it were given by Giulio\r\nParigi, an excellent architect; and afterwards by Baccio del Bianco, who\r\nbecame engineer to his Catholic Majesty Philip IV. Their theoretic views\r\nwere seconded by the example of Colonna, who came to Florence in 1638,\r\nalong with Mitelli, a native of that place, and remained six years in\r\nthe service of the court. After this period Florence produced many\r\npainters of cabinet pieces, and in the ornamental line, or rather a new\r\nschool of painting was founded by Jacomo Chiavistelli, a painter of\r\nsound and more chaste taste than was common in that age. One may form an\r\nidea of him in several churches, and in many saloons in the city; as for\r\ninstance, in that of the Cerretani palace, which is among his most\r\nelegant works. He likewise painted for cabinets, where his perspective\r\npieces are frequently to be met with. Orlandi notices his most\r\nconsiderable pupils, Rinaldo Botti, and his cousin Lorenzo del\r\nMoro,[223] Benedetto Fortini, and Giuseppe Tonelli, who also studied at\r\nBologna. To these may be added, Angiol Gori, Giuseppe Masini, and others\r\nwho assisted him about 1658, in painting the corridore of the ducal\r\ngallery, which is not their best performance. I find in the anecdotes of\r\nMondina and Alboresi, edited by Malvasia, that Antonio Ruggieri\r\ncontended with them in Florence: he was, I believe, a scholar of\r\nVannini, and a S. Andrew by him exists in the church of S. Michele, in\r\nBerteldi, now commonly called S. Gaetano. Nor were these the only\r\nartists capable of introducing figures into their perspective pieces;\r\nbut a great many of the painters in fresco were, if we may say so,\r\nambidexter, for each could paint perspectives and figures at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPortrait painting, the school of the best artists who aspire to fidelity\r\nof representation, was greatly promoted by Passignano, who instructed\r\nFilippo Furini, surnamed Sciameroni, the father of the celebrated\r\nFrancesco. He also taught the art to Domenico and Valore Casini, two\r\nbrothers celebrated by Baldinucci: Valore was remarkable for a free\r\npencil, and was a faithful copyist of every lineament. The capital is\r\nfilled with his portraits. Cristofano Allori painted portraits, both on\r\ncommission and for exercising his hand in the delineation of the most\r\nbeautiful forms. His portraits on canvass are reckoned valuable, even\r\nwhen the subjects are not known: this is the case with that in\r\npossession of the senator Orlandini; and some on small pieces of copper,\r\nin the grand Medicean collection. Cerrini, among his disciples, followed\r\nhis steps; he is, I think, also admitted into that museum. Giovanni\r\nBatista Stefaneschi, a monk of Monte Senario, a scholar of Comodi, and\r\nan excellent miniature painter, was conspicuous among the painters of\r\nportraits and copyists.\r\n\r\nJustus Subtermans, a native of Antwerp, who was educated by William de\r\nVos, was also greatly admired. Having fixed his residence at Florence,\r\nin the time of Cosmo II., he was retained by the court to the end of the\r\nreign of Cosmo III.; and went to other princes in Germany and Italy, who\r\nwere ambitious of having a specimen of a portrait painter, esteemed\r\nlittle inferior to Vandyck. He was much esteemed by the latter, who\r\nrequested his portrait, prefacing his request by sending him his own.\r\nPeter Paul Rubens likewise honoured him, and presented him with one of\r\nhis own historical pictures, regarding him as an honour to their\r\ncountry. Subtermans painted all the living members of the Medicean\r\nfamily, in a variety of attitudes; and when Ferdinand II. ascended the\r\nthrone, while still a young man, Subtermans executed a stupendous\r\npicture, wholly composed of portraits. He represented in it the ceremony\r\nof swearing allegiance to the new sovereign; and pourtrayed him not only\r\nwith his mother and grandmother, but the senators and nobility who were\r\npresent. This picture was very large: it has been engraved on copper and\r\nstill remains in the gallery. The artist had a neatness and elegance of\r\npencil that appeared extraordinary even in the school to which he\r\nbelonged; and possessed moreover a peculiar talent of ennobling every\r\ncountenance without injuring the likeness. It was his practice to study\r\nthe peculiar and characteristic air of the person, and to impart it to\r\nhis work; so that when he would sometimes conceal the face of a\r\nportrait, the bystanders could with certainty tell whom it represented,\r\nfrom the disposition of the hands and the figure.\r\n\r\nJacopo Borgognone remained long in Florence, and was highly respected by\r\nPrince Matthias; whose military achievements in Germany and in Italy,\r\nand the places where they happened, he represented to the life, as an\r\nhistorian would have described them. This artist's battle-pieces are not\r\nrare in Florence; but I do not know that he had any pupils in that\r\nplace. The person who promoted most the imitation of Jacopo, and whose\r\nworks are everywhere, was Pandolfo Reschi, of Danzig, who was one of his\r\nbest scholars; eminent in landscape in the style of Salvator Rosa, and\r\nin architectural subjects. In the hands of Dr. Viligiardi, I saw a\r\npicture by him, with a view of the Pitti palace, and the additions to it\r\nthen wanting; but which were afterwards supplied by the Austrian\r\nprinces, to the great ornament of the royal residence. Those additions\r\nwere from a design of Giacinta Marmi; but the whole picture was the work\r\nof Pandolfo. He enlivened it with figures, and excites surprise by the\r\nwhole, excepting the distribution of the light and shadow, in which he\r\nis not so happy. One Santi Rinaldi, surnamed Il Tromba,[224] a painter\r\nof battle-pieces and of landscapes, formed himself under Furini: he was\r\ncontemporary with Pandolfo; but is less known in Florence.\r\n\r\nBaccio del Bianco, having become a good designer and tolerable painter\r\nin the school of Bilivert, went into Germany with Pieroni, the imperial\r\narchitect and engineer, from whom he learnt perspective. He afterwards\r\ntaught it with applause in Florence, as we have said; and did not omit\r\nto exercise his pencil, especially in fresco. Naturally facetious, he\r\nbecame distinguished by his burlesques, which, for the most part, were\r\nonly designed with the pen. He coloured some small oil pictures of much\r\nforce, which were portraits in the style of the Caracci, and sometimes\r\npainted freaks of scaramouches, and similar abortions of nature.\r\n\r\nGio. Batista Brazze, called Il Bigio,[225] a scholar of Empoli, employed\r\nhis genius in another branch of the capricious style: it consisted of\r\nwhat appeared human figures when seen at a distance, but a nearer\r\napproach shewed them to be composed of different sorts of fruit, or\r\nmachines, artfully arranged. Baldinucci reckons him the inventor of this\r\nart; but to me it appears, that prior examples may be found in the\r\nMilanese school, in which I treat of them fully at the end of the second\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nLastly, mosaic work in hard stone owes its rise in Florence to this\r\nepoch; and after gradually improving during two centuries, is now\r\neverywhere known as a work of this capital, and almost exclusively its\r\nown. In a letter of Teofilo Gallaccini,[226] we read that this species\r\nof mosaic \"had been invented in Florence, in the time of Ferdinand I.;\"\r\nan assertion which is not true. Before that period it flourished in\r\nLombardy. The Carthusian Monastery of Pavia had in its pay a family of\r\nthe name of Sacchi; which has existed there to our own times, and has\r\nfilled the great church with this kind of mosaic. There are specimens of\r\nit in Milan of very ancient date. In that place Giacomo da Trezzo, who\r\nexecuted the tabernacle for the church of the Escurial, which is\r\nesteemed the most beautiful and magnificent in Christendom,[227]\r\nreceived his instruction. About the time of Cosmo I., Florence herself\r\nwitnessed the rudiments of this art in a \"small picture composed of\r\ngems\" which she possessed, as is recorded by Vasari.[228] A similar one\r\nwas executed for Francis I., from a design of Vasari, by Bernardino di\r\nPorfirio of Leccio, (a district of the Florentine state) \"composed of\r\noriental alabaster, and large slabs of jasper, heliotrope, cornelian,\r\nlapis lazzuli, agate, and other stones and gems, which they estimate at\r\n20,000 crowns.\" But pictures so wrought in large pieces, were not of\r\nthat perfect kind of mosaic that contained a vast variety of colours and\r\nmiddle tints. Such are executed in every shade of colour, from the\r\nnatural stains of the stone itself; and the tints are lowered,\r\nheightened, and managed, so as almost to rival painting. For this\r\npurpose, every species of hard stone is collected and sawed; innumerable\r\ncolours are thence selected, graduating from the deepest to the lightest\r\nshade, which are kept ready for use. This art was in request at Milan;\r\nwhere, on account of the vicinity of Alpine countries abounding in every\r\nspecies of hard stone, it arrived at great perfection. Francesco I.\r\nmeditating the erection of the magnificent chapel for the sepulture of\r\nthe royal family, in the church of S. Lorenzo, and the ornamenting it\r\nwith urns and altars wrought in hard stone, invited Giovanni Bianchi\r\nfrom that city to his court, in the year 1580, and committed the works\r\nin mosaic to his direction. Soon after Ferdinando ascended the throne,\r\nand the new art gained ground under him; it was promoted by Constantino\r\nde' Servi, and afterwards by other artists, who progressively improved\r\nit. The tables, cabinets, and coffers, small landscapes, and\r\narchitectural pieces which were there executed, and sent as presents to\r\nprinces, are dispersed over Europe. In one cabinet of the ducal gallery\r\nthere is an exquisite octagonal table, the round central piece of which\r\nwas designed by Poccetti, and the ornamental border by Ligozzi. Jacopo\r\nAutelli executed the work, on which, with numerous assistants, he was\r\nemployed for sixteen years, and finished it in 1649. In the cabinet of\r\ncameos and engraved gems, there are figures in mezzo-relievo, and entire\r\nlittle statues in hard stone, fabricated by the same company of artists;\r\nnot to mention what is in the Pitti palace and the church of S. Lorenzo.\r\nA similar company still exists, under the direction of the Signori\r\nSiries, and abounding in subordinate artists, which is supported with\r\nroyal magnificence by the prince, for whom it is constantly employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: The new style began in the reign of Francesco I., who was\r\ngreatly skilled in design, which he had learnt of Buontalenti. He was\r\nsucceeded by Ferdinando I., Cosmo II., Ferdinando II., all of them\r\ncelebrated for their magnificent works in ornamenting the city and the\r\npalace: Cardinals Gio. Carlo and Leopoldo de' Medici also flourished\r\nthere, both of them patrons of the arts; and the latter is recorded in\r\nhistory for his knowledge of them, and the splendid collection which he\r\nformed. We may add to these Prince Mattia, and others of that family.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: He was born in 1624, and died in 1692, leaving materials\r\nfor the completion of the work, which were afterwards arranged by\r\nSaverio, his son, a gentleman of the law, who put the finishing hand to\r\nthe whole.

This work,\r\nleft imperfect by him, was completed by Pagani, by Montelatici, and by\r\nFurini, with some semicircular pieces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: This is expressed by the Italians by \"il possesso del\r\nsotto in su.\" Tr.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: See tom. ii. of Signor Giachi, p. 202.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: The Ragged Cloak recovered.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: It was published with notes by Dr. Paolo Minucci, and was\r\nreprinted with other illustrations of Sig.

He is a poet in all his historic pieces, his\r\ncomposition is full of fancy; this, however, is not equally commended by\r\nall, who look for the simple action without other accessaries.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: The Bully.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: Botti is pronounced a famous fresco painter by Magalotti,\r\nin _Lett.

Sects in painting\r\nhave the same fate as sects in philosophy: one succeeds another; and the\r\nnew principles are propagated more or less rapidly, according to the\r\ndegree of opposition they have to encounter where they happen to be\r\ndiffused. The manner of Cortona met with considerable opposition in\r\nRome, as we shall find in the proper place. He was invited to Florence\r\nby Ferdinand II. about the year 1640, to ornament some of the apartments\r\nof the Pitti palace; and this work, in which he spent several years, has\r\nappeared to connoisseurs the most beautiful he ever performed. He was\r\ndirected in this work by Michelangiolo Bonarruoti the younger, a\r\nliterary man of great judgment; and Cortona appears also to display\r\nlearning in the execution. In one apartment he painted the four ages of\r\nthe world, which the poets of all nations have described in imitation of\r\nHesiod; five other chambers were dedicated to five fabulous deities,\r\nfrom whom they were named the chamber of Minerva, of Apollo, of Mars, of\r\nJupiter, and of Mercury. He united the mythology of each with history.\r\nThus, for instance, in the chamber of Apollo, he represents this patron\r\nof the fine arts on the ceiling in the act of receiving the young\r\nHercules, who is introduced by Minerva, that he may be instructed; and\r\non the walls he painted Alexander reading the works of Homer, Augustus\r\nlistening to Virgil, and other similar stories, which are fully\r\ndescribed by Passeri in his Life of Cortona. The great work was finished\r\nby Ciro Ferri; for after Cortona had begun the chamber of Mercury, on\r\nsome disgust, which is variously related, he secretly withdrew from\r\ncourt, returned to Rome, and always declined when repeatedly invited to\r\nrevisit Florence. There, however, he had laid the foundations of a new\r\nschool. Baldinucci remarks on the style of Pietro, that it was no sooner\r\nseen at Florence, than praised by the best judges.[229] The predilection\r\nof Cosmo III. contributed to bring it into credit; this prince pensioned\r\nCiro Ferri in Rome, that he might instruct the Tuscans who came there to\r\nstudy. At that time there was no artist of that country who did not,\r\nmore or less, imitate this style. We shall now describe it, and trace it\r\nto its origin.\r\n\r\nPietro Berrettini, a native of Cortona, the scholar of Comodi in\r\nTuscany, and of Ciarpi at Rome, is mentioned also among the writers on\r\nthe art.[230] He acquired his knowledge of design by copying antique\r\nbasso-relievos, and the chiaroscuros of Polidoro, a man who appears\r\ninspired by the soul of an ancient. Pietro chose Trajan's column as his\r\nfavourite study; and from it he may have drawn his heavy proportions,\r\nand the appearance of strength and robustness, that characterize even\r\nhis female forms and his children: in their eyes, noses, and lips, he\r\nsurpasses the medium standard; and their hands and feet are certainly\r\nnot remarkable for their light elegance. But in contrast, or the art of\r\nopposing group to group, figure to figure, and part to part, in which he\r\nwas distinguished, he appears to have followed Lanfranco, and partly to\r\nhave formed it from the Bacchanalian vases, which are particularly\r\nmentioned in his life by Passeri. His taste may probably have been\r\ndrawn, in some measure, from the Venetian school; since having gone to\r\nstudy there, and then returned to Rome, he destroyed what he had\r\npreviously done, and executed his works anew in the Barberini palace,\r\naccording to the account of Boschini, his great admirer. Generally\r\nspeaking, he finishes nothing highly but what was intended to be most\r\nconspicuous; he avoids strong shadows, is fond of middle tints, prefers\r\nthe less brilliant grounds, colours without affectation, and is reckoned\r\nthe inventor and chief artist of a style, which, in the opinion of\r\nMengs, combines facility with taste. He employed it in pictures of all\r\nsizes with applause; but in painting of furniture, and still more on\r\nceilings, in cupolas, and recesses, he carried it to a pitch of beauty\r\nwhich will never fail to procure him panegyrists and imitators. The\r\njudicious division of his historical compositions, which derives aid\r\nfrom the architecture, that skilful gradation by which he represents the\r\nimmensity of aerial space beyond the clouds, his knowledge in the art of\r\nforeshortening what is seen from below, that play of light seemingly\r\ncelestial, that symmetrical disposition of his figures, are\r\ncircumstances which enchant the eye and fascinate the soul.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this manner does not always satisfy the mind; for intent\r\non gratifying the eye, it introduces useless figures, in order that the\r\ncomposition may not be deficient in the usual fulness; and for the sake\r\nof contrast, figures in the performance of the gentlest actions, are\r\npainted as if the artist was representing them in a tournament or a\r\nbattle. Gifted by nature with facility of genius, and no less judgment,\r\nBerrettini either avoided this extravagance, as in his stupendous\r\nConversion of S. Paul, or did not carry it to that absurdity, which in\r\nour times has marked his followers, from the usual tendency of all\r\nschools to overcharge the characteristic of their master. Hence the\r\nfacility of this style has degenerated into negligence and its taste\r\ninto affectation; until its chief adherents begin as at present to\r\nabandon it, and to adopt a superior manner.\r\n\r\nBut not to wander from the Florentine school, we must confess that this\r\nepoch has been the least productive of eminent painters. Pietro had some\r\npupils at that place, who did him equal honour with the Romanelli and\r\nthe Ferri at Rome. I shall first mention a foreigner, who having\r\nestablished himself at Florence, may be reckoned of that school. Livio\r\nMehus, a native of Flanders, came into Tuscany from Milan, where he had\r\nreceived some instruction in the art from another Fleming, named\r\nCharles, was taken under the protection of Prince Matthias, and\r\nrecommended to Berrettini, who gave him lessons for a little time both\r\nin Florence and at Rome. By copying the antique he became a good\r\ndesigner, and he studied colouring at Venice and in Lombardy. He\r\nretained little of the manner of Cortona besides the composition. He\r\nimitated the Venetians less in colouring, than in the light and firm\r\ntouches of his pencil. His tints are modest, his attitudes lively, his\r\nshadows most beautiful, and his inventions ingenious. He painted few\r\naltar pieces, but many cabinet pictures, for he was pensioned by the\r\nprince, and employed by noble families, in whose houses his works are\r\noften to be met with. The historical picture of the Repose of Bacchus\r\nand Ariadne, which he painted for Marquis Gerini, in emulation of Ciro\r\nFerri, is very highly praised. Ferri conceived some jealousy of him,\r\nwhen he painted the cupola of the Pace at Florence; where he appears to\r\napproach the Lombard school, and even to surpass Cortona.[231] He was\r\nimitated by a Lorenzo Rossi, previously a scholar of Pier Dandini, who,\r\naccording to P. Orlandi, executed some elegant small pictures.\r\n\r\nVincenzio Dandini went from the school of his brother Cesare into that\r\nof Cortona, or rather into the Roman school, where he copied, as well as\r\nhe could, with unwearied assiduity, the finest specimens in painting,\r\nsculpture, and architecture. On this foundation, aided by practice in\r\nanatomy, at the academy for the naked figure, which still flourished at\r\nFlorence, he became superior to his brother in design and in softness of\r\ncolouring: he also finished more highly than Cesare, was more studious\r\nin his drapery, and in the other branches of the art. In All Saints\r\nthere is a Conception of the Virgin, and three other pictures by his\r\nhand. He was employed in the ducal villas: in that of Poggio Imperiale\r\nhe painted a beautifully foreshortened figure of Aurora, attended by the\r\nHours, in a recess he had erected; and at Petraia painted in oil the\r\nSacrifice of Niobe. In him the pupil of Cortona is very manifest. A\r\nsimilar style, but degenerated both in execution and in manner, is\r\ndiscoverable in Pietro, his son and scholar. This artist was superior to\r\nall the other Dandini; and by more extensive travels he obtained a\r\ngreater knowledge of foreign painters: it would have been well if he had\r\nnot attempted to surpass them also in his emoluments. From avarice he\r\nundertook too many works, and contented himself with a certain\r\nmediocrity in study; for which he, in some measure compensated by a\r\nfreedom of pencil that is always admirable. Where well paid, he\r\ndemonstrated his abilities; as in the cupola of S. Mary Magdalen; in\r\nseveral frescos in the ducal palace at Florence, in the royal villas,\r\nand in the copious historical picture of the taking of Jerusalem, which\r\nhe painted in the public palace at Pisa. He also painted some\r\naltar-pieces worthy of himself; as the S. Francis in S. Maria Maggiore or\r\nthe Beato Piccolomini in the attitude of saying mass, in possession of\r\nthe Servi; a beautiful picture, full of spirited attitudes. His son,\r\nOttaviano, appears his follower in some semicircular pictures in the\r\ncloister of S. Spirito, in a piece representing various saints in the\r\nchurch of S. Lorenzo; and wherever he was employed. One of his grandest\r\nworks may be seen in S. Mary Magdalen at Pescia, the ceiling of which he\r\npainted in fresco.\r\n\r\nThe Dandini family had many scholars, who, with their descendants, have\r\nkept alive the school of Cortona, even to our own days. This school was\r\nnot eminent; it requires but little examination, or prolixity of\r\ndescription. It has produced some good artists; but few of them are\r\nabove mediocrity; a fault less to be attributed to their genius, than\r\nthe times. The more modern style was esteemed the best: the last master\r\nseemed to discover new maxims in painting, and abolished the old: and\r\nthus artists of little celebrity gave birth to others more minute and\r\nmannered, resembling their prototype in maxims, but inferior in\r\nreputation. About this time it became fashionable to paint with a\r\ncertain degree of careless ease, or _Sprezzatura_, as it is styled by\r\nsome; and Giordano and some Venetians are applauded for this manner.\r\nSeveral Florentine artists tried to imitate them, and have produced\r\nworks that resemble sketches: this species of mannerism is not uncommon\r\nin other schools. It is unnecessary to be particular, but only to\r\nobserve generally that such artists are as rare in choice collections of\r\npictures, as Andrea del Sarto or Cigoli: the latter are there scarce,\r\nbecause they painted with great care; the former class because they\r\npainted with very little. In the work entitled _Series of the most\r\ncelebrated painters_, we find Antonio Riccianti, Michele Noferi, and\r\nsome others whose names are merely mentioned as scholars of Vincenzio;\r\nand Gabbiani is the only one particularly praised. In like manner, among\r\nthe pupils of Pietro Dandini we find the names of Gio. Cinqui, whose\r\nportrait is in the ducal gallery, Antonio Puglieschi, of Florence, who\r\nstudied under Ciro, and Valerio Baldassari of Pescia; but there is a\r\nparticular eulogy bestowed on Fratinelli, whom we shall notice\r\nhereafter. I find also that P. Alberigo Carlini, a Minorite monk of\r\nPescia, was the pupil of Ottaviano, and attended Conca at Rome. He\r\npainted some good pictures, chiefly in the church of his order at\r\nPietrasanta. To his we may also add the name of Santarelli, a patrician\r\nof the same country, and who died at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated pupil of the Dandini was Anton Domenico Gabbiani,\r\nnot long ago mentioned; before he was the pupil of Vincenzio, he had\r\nlessons from Subtermans, and finished his education at Rome under Ciro\r\nFerri, and at Venice by studying the best masters. We must not give\r\ncredit to Pascoli, who has represented him as a mean artist.[232]\r\nGabbiani ranks amongst the best designers of his age; a collection of\r\nhis drawings is in the possession of Sig. Pacini, which was often\r\ninspected and commended by Mengs for the facility and elegance he there\r\ndiscovered. Many of his designs were engraved and published in his life\r\nby Ignatius Hugford. His colouring sometimes borders on the languid, but\r\nis generally good: he is correct and natural, especially in fleshy\r\ntints; juicy, and tempered by a pleasing harmony. The greatest fault in\r\nthe style of this artist is in his draperies, which, though correct, and\r\nstudied with his usual diligence, always exhibit a degree of heaviness\r\nin the execution, are too confined, and sometimes are not quite true in\r\nthe colouring. His merit is very great in light subjects: in the Pitti,\r\nand other palaces of some of the nobility of Florence, his dances of\r\ngenii and groups of boys are to be met with, and yield little to those\r\nof Baciccio. One of the finest is in the house of the Orlandini family;\r\nand the Marquis of Riccardi has specimens among the mirrors placed in\r\nhis collection. His largest and most celebrated work in fresco is the\r\nvast cupola of Cestello, which he did not wholly finish. His oil\r\npictures are esteemed precious even in the ducal gallery. Several of his\r\nworks of unequal merit are preserved in churches; but his S. Philip, in\r\npossession of the fathers Dell' Oratorio, justifies the assertion of\r\nRedi, that, except Maratta, there was then no painter in Rome that could\r\neclipse him.[233] The catalogue of his scholars is extensive; but some\r\nof them, as happens to every master, may be also claimed by other\r\npreceptors. Benedetto Luti was an honour to Gabbiani and to Florence.\r\nHaving formed himself in this school, he went to Rome, in hopes of\r\nreceiving the instructions of Ciro Ferri; but the death of that master\r\nintervening, he was guided by his own genius, and the monuments of art\r\nexisting in that city. The style he there formed may be considered a\r\ncompound of various imitations, select in the forms, pleasing and bright\r\nin colouring, shewing art in the distribution of light and shade, and as\r\nharmonious to the eye as is the orator to the ear, who enchants an\r\naudience by his well turned periods; the delightful fascination is felt,\r\nbut the source of it cannot be assigned. In that metropolis we shall\r\nfind him master of the new style; but in Tuscany we cannot point out\r\nmany of his pictures besides those in the ducal palace: private\r\ncollections are rich only in his crayon pieces, which are likewise well\r\nknown out of Italy. There is one of his large pictures on canvass at\r\nPisa, the subject of which is the Vestment of S. Ranieri; and it is the\r\nmost admired among the larger paintings of the cathedral. Luti sent it\r\nto Gabbiani for his correction before it was exposed to the public; a\r\ncircumstance highly honourable to the modesty of the scholar and the\r\nabilities of the master.[234] His portrait is in the ducal gallery; and\r\nthe more rigid critics, on looking at it, have been known to say,\r\n\"Behold the last painter of his school.\"\r\n\r\nTommaso Redi was a pupil of the same master; and is noticed in the\r\n_Lettere Pittoriche_, as a good composer of historical pictures, and is\r\nalso praised for design, colouring, and spirit. From the school of\r\nGabbiani he went under the tuition of Maratta and Balestra, both artists\r\nrespectable for their style, and declared enemies to the innovations\r\nwhich have occupied and debased our schools for so long a period. Redi\r\nalso visited the most celebrated schools, but for the sole purpose of\r\nstudying the old masters, and of making copies of their works, some of\r\nwhich, with a few pieces of his own invention, remain in his family. In\r\nthe eulogy of Anton Domenico we find honourable mention made of his\r\nnephew, Gaetano Gabbiani; of Francesco Salvetti, his intimate friend; of\r\nGio. Antonio Pucci, a painter and a poet; of Giuseppe Baldini, whose\r\npromising career was cut short by death, and of Ranieri del Pace, a\r\nnative of Pisa, who afterwards yielding to the torrent of fashion,\r\nbecame a complete mannerist. Ignatius Hugford, born in Florence, but\r\nwhose father was a native of England,[235] was admirably skilled in\r\nrecognizing the hands of different masters, and likewise painted in a\r\ngood manner a picture of S. Raphael at S. Felicita, and some other\r\npieces, which were mostly small, and have been admitted into the royal\r\nmuseum. The feeble paintings in possession of the Vallombrosani at\r\nForli, and some of the same stamp at Florence, are likewise by this\r\nartist.\r\n\r\nAlessandro Gherardini, a rival of Gabbiani, and in the opinion of many,\r\nhis superior in genius as a painter, had wonderful facility in\r\ncounterfeiting different styles. He would have equalled any of his\r\ncontemporaries, had he always painted in the style of his Crucifixion of\r\nour Lord in Candeli, in which he calls to mind a happy imitation of\r\ndifferent schools. It is a work studied in every part, especially in the\r\ngeneral tone, which artfully expresses the darkness of that hour. A\r\nhistory piece of Alexander the Great, in Casa Orlandini, with figures of\r\nhalf-length, and executed with great industry, is also held in high\r\nesteem; but he aimed at painting pictures of every degree of merit. One\r\nof his pupils, no less fertile in talent, and named Sebastiano Galeotti,\r\nis rather remembered than known at Florence. He left his native place\r\nwhen young, travelled about a long time without any fixed residence, and\r\nhas left specimens behind him in many parts of Upper Italy. He at length\r\nsettled at Genoa, where we shall again notice him. The ducal gallery\r\ncontains portraits both of the master and of the scholar, by the side of\r\nthose of Gabbiani and Redi. Other considerable painters of this epoch\r\nhave obtained a similar honour; among whom we may mention Agostino\r\nVeracini, a scholar of Sebastian Ricci, Francesco Conti, a disciple of\r\nMaratta, and Lapi, a follower of Giordano; each of these has\r\nsuccessfully imitated his guide.[236] The S. Apollonia of the first,\r\npainted for the church of that name; various Madonnas of the second, in\r\nthe hands of private gentlemen; and the Transfiguration of the last, in\r\nthe ducal gallery, are calculated to do them honour, and even to shed a\r\nlustre on some of their less refined productions. Some others now dead\r\nhave been equally honoured by a portrait, of whom I have not discovered\r\nany other work. Of this number are Vincenzio Bacherelli, Gio. Francesco\r\nBagnoli, Anton Sebastiano Bettini, Gio. Casini, Niccolo Nannetti, and\r\nothers, who are mentioned in the _Museo Fiorentino_.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Camillo Sagrestani, a scholar of Giusti, was esteemed at\r\nFlorence, even during the lifetime of Gabbiani and Gherardini. To study\r\ndifferent masters, he visited the best schools of Italy, and for some\r\ntime attended the school of Cav. Cignani, whose manner he copied rather\r\nthan emulated. One of his Holy Families is in the Madonna de' Ricci, the\r\nbeauty of which has more of an ideal cast, and the colouring is more\r\nflorid, than is usual with his contemporaries of this school. One of the\r\nfirst judges in Florence assured me that this painting was the work of\r\nSagrestani, although others ascribe it to his scholar, Matteo Bonechi.\r\nBonechi had excellent parts, but not an equal knowledge of the art, in\r\nwhich he is reported to have been instructed by a species of dictation;\r\nfor he practised under the eye, and was directed by the voice of his\r\nmaster. He thus became one of those practical artists who make up for\r\nthe poverty of their design by their spirit and their colouring. There\r\nare some of his pictures that in any collection would be particularly\r\ncalculated to attract the eye. Among his works in fresco, the picture at\r\nCestello, where he finished what was begun by Gabbiani, is worthy of\r\nrecord; and also that in the Capponi palace near the Nunziata, where he\r\ncontinued the work of Marinari.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Cignani died in Bologna, and Gio. Gioseffo del Sole,\r\ndenominated the modern Guido, enjoyed the highest reputation. Florence\r\nemployed three of his eminent pupils; one of the two Soderini, Meucci,\r\nand Ferretti, who although called da Imola, was born and lived in\r\nFlorence. Mauro Soderini enjoyed the reputation of a good designer, and\r\naimed at beauty and effect in his pictures. The Death of S. Joseph in\r\nthe cathedral is said to be by his hand, though it is in fact by\r\nFerretti; the Child revived by S. Zanobi, in the church of S. Stephen,\r\nis really his. Vincenzio Meucci was chiefly employed in works of\r\nperspective, which he executed in many parts of Tuscany, and even in the\r\ncupola of the royal chapel in S. Lorenzo. If there was any one who could\r\ndispute with him pre-eminence in fresco painting, it was his fellow\r\ndisciple, Giovanni Domenico Ferretti, whose works may be seen in\r\nFlorence, in several other parts of Tuscany, and at Bologna; from which\r\nhe appears to have surpassed Meucci in fancy and in spirit, and\r\nespecially at the Philippini at Pistoia, where his performance in the\r\ncupola is highly praised. In fresco works they were both excellent; but\r\nin oil paintings they often were too hasty, an error into which all\r\nfresco painters, not excepting the most esteemed, have fallen. Hence\r\nFerretti, although he painted the Martyrdom of S. Bartolommeo, for the\r\nchurch dedicated to that saint at Pisa, in an excellent style, did not\r\ngive equal satisfaction by his History of S. Guido, in the\r\narchiepiscopal church. Several of the works of Meucci are dispersed\r\nthrough the various churches in Florence; and in a chapel of the\r\nNunziata, where he painted the recess, he coloured a Madonna, which is\r\nallowed to be one of his most diligent and best finished pictures. He\r\nwas there rivalled by Giuseppe Grisoni, a scholar of Redi; and it is\r\nreported that vexation at this circumstance shortened his days. Grisoni\r\nhad travelled more than he in visiting the schools of Italy, had even\r\ngone to England, and had acquired great skill in figures, and still more\r\nin landscape. He therefore was induced to add landscape not only to\r\nhistorical, but also to portrait painting; as in the instance of a\r\nportrait of himself that is one of the most respectable in the second\r\nchamber of painters. He added it also to the S. Barbara, painted in\r\ncompetition with Meucci; and it is a picture which does honour to the\r\nschool in form, relief, and taste of colouring. He likewise painted\r\nother pieces on the same plan, in which, however, he did not succeed so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nMeucci and Grisoni cannot be reckoned Italian artists of the same rank\r\nwith Luti; but if all are to be estimated by the times in which they\r\nflourished, each was eminent in his day. I had noticed them briefly in\r\nmy first edition, and some painters have informed me, that with them I\r\nought to have mentioned Giuseppe Zocchi, who was a painter of note, and\r\nshould not have been omitted even in a compendium of the history of the\r\nart. I now correct my error, and produce what information the noble\r\nfamily of Gerini, under whose protection he was received when a boy, and\r\nwho, after his elementary studies at Florence, sent him to Rome, to\r\nBologna, and other parts of Lombardy, for his instruction in the\r\ndifferent schools, have supplied me. I may be allowed to add, that the\r\nFlorentine nobility have always been most liberal in this way; and there\r\nare not a few living artists who owe their education in the fine arts to\r\nthe bounty of some noble family: such clients are an ornament to a\r\nnobleman, and are not to be numbered among his servants. Zocchi had a\r\ngenius fertile in invention, pliant in imitation, and judicious in\r\nselection; and hence at the conclusion of such a course of study, he was\r\nable to compose large works with skill, and to colour beautifully. He\r\npainted four pretty large frescos in the villa Serristori, beyond the\r\ngate of S. Nicholas, some apartments in the Rinuccini palace, and one in\r\nthe Gerini gallery; and these are believed to be his best works of this\r\nsort. In smaller pieces he was still greater; as in his oil picture of\r\nthe festivities at Siena, on the arrival of the Emperor Francis I., a\r\nwork very true in the perspective, and graceful in the multitude of\r\nfigures which he there inserted. It is deposited in the splendid\r\nSansedonii collection of pictures at Siena, where the entertainment\r\ngiven to the Grand Duke Peter Leopold may also be seen: with this object\r\nin view the painter went to Siena, where he caught the epidemic disorder\r\nthat raged there in 1767, and soon after died at Florence.\r\n\r\nOn turning to the other parts of Tuscany, we find them from the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century full of the followers of Cortona;\r\nSan Sepolcro boasted one Zei, of whom I find no further account than\r\nthat of his painting an altar-piece representing the souls in purgatory,\r\nfor the cathedral of that place, a work extremely well coloured, and\r\nconducted in the maxims of the school, though the countenances are of a\r\ncommon cast; and if we except the liberating angel, of poor expression.\r\nAmong this sect we cannot include Gio. Batista Mercati, one of the\r\nlatest painters of that city, not unknown at Rome, and much noted in his\r\nnative place, where he painted either at a more mature time of life, or\r\nwith greater pains. Two of his historical frescos, representing our\r\nLady, are in S. Chiara; and at S. Lorenzo there is a picture of the\r\ntitular with other saints; in both there is an air apparently drawn from\r\nthe school of the Caracci, especially in the breadth of the drapery,\r\nwhich is well cast, and skilfully varied. In the Guides to Venice and to\r\nRome, several of his works are mentioned, and in that of Leghorn, the\r\nonly picture in the cathedral esteemed worthy of notice is that of the\r\nFive Saints, painted by Mercati with great care. Orlandi notices Tommaso\r\nLancisi, a scholar of Scaminossi, and two of his brothers, and adds,\r\nthat painting was an hereditary honour in this family.\r\n\r\nOne only of the countrymen of Berrettini is known to me as his follower;\r\nhis name is Adriano Palladino; he is mentioned by Orlandi, which is the\r\nonly trace of him that I have discovered; I never saw any of his works,\r\nnor heard them mentioned by any one.\r\n\r\nArezzo abounds with pictures in the manner of Cortona. Salvi\r\nCastellucci, the scholar of Pietro, either at Florence or at Rome, was a\r\ngreat imitator of his style, and painted with expedition, according to\r\nthe practice of the school. He executed many good pieces in the\r\ncathedral, and other churches, besides numerous cabinet pictures that\r\nare in private houses, which are estimable for the facility and good\r\ntaste of their colouring. One of his frescos, representing our Lady\r\nsurrounded by the patron saints of the city, is in the public palace;\r\nbut he is greater in oil painting. He had a son, on whom he bestowed the\r\nname of Pietro, probably in honour of his master. He also was a follower\r\nof Cortona, but never equalled his father.\r\n\r\nPistoia, however, had two Gimignani, the father Giacinto, and Lodovico,\r\nhis son, of whom it is still disputed which was the most eminent. From\r\nthe school of Poussin, Giacinto entered that of Berrettini; and as he\r\napproached nearer his first master in design and composition, so in\r\ncolouring and in taste for architecture he came nearest to the second.\r\nHe moreover took the lead in works of fresco. Here he rivalled Camassei\r\nand Maratta, at the baptistery of S. Gio. Laterano, where he painted the\r\nhistories of Constantine, besides leaving other specimens in different\r\nparts of Rome, in the Niccolini palace at Florence, and other places. In\r\nsome pictures he also emulated Guercino, as for instance in the Leander\r\nin the ducal gallery, which was long considered as a Guercino. Though\r\nLodovico was the scholar of Giacinto, he is not so correct in design,\r\nbut was superior to his father in all the faculties that excite pleasing\r\nemotions; his ideas are more beautiful, his tints more lovely, his\r\nattitudes more spirited, and his harmony more agreeable. It would appear\r\neither that the style of his maternal uncle Orbetto, had attracted his\r\nattention, or that Bernini, the director of his studies, had led him\r\ninto this path. He obtained great applause for his works in fresco, and\r\nthose he executed at Rome in the church of the Virgins are studied by\r\nartists for the attitudes, the clouds, and the grace of the wings with\r\nwhich his angels were furnished. He chiefly resided at Rome, which\r\npossesses several of his paintings for churches, and a far greater\r\nnumber for halls and private rooms; being moreover much employed in\r\nthese for foreign countries. Two histories of S. John by the hand of\r\nGiacinto, are in the church dedicated to that saint at Pistoia; and\r\nthere was also a S. Rocco in the cathedral, which was esteemed\r\nexcellent. Lodovico executed a beautiful picture for the church of the\r\nCapuchins, now converted into a parish church.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of both, Lazzaro Baldi still remained, another great\r\nornament of the school of Cortona, and of Pistoia, his native place. He\r\nmay be there recognised in two pictures, the Annunciation in the church\r\nof S. Francis, and the Repose in Egypt in that of the Madonna della\r\nUmilta. This latter place is a most majestic octagonal temple, executed\r\nby Ventura Vitoni of Pistoia, the great pupil of Bramante, and\r\nsurmounted by a cupola, which is reckoned among the noblest in Italy.\r\nBaldi finally established his abode in Rome; where he was much employed,\r\nas well as in other parts of the states of the Church. One of the most\r\nstudied pictures he ever painted is at S. Camerino, and represents S.\r\nPeter receiving the pontifical power. A still more recent artist is Gio.\r\nDomenico Piastrini, a scholar of Luti, who in the porch of Madonna della\r\nUmilta, filled two large spaces with pictures, illustrative of the\r\nhistory of this church, and who rivalled the best followers of Maratta,\r\nin S. Maria in Via Lata, at Rome. It is not foreign to this period to\r\nnotice Gio. Batista Cipriani, who was born in Florence, but descended\r\nfrom a family of Pistoia;[237] especially as he left specimens of his\r\npencil in the neighbourhood of the places we have just mentioned. Two of\r\nhis altar-pieces were in the abbey of S. Michael-on-the-Sea; one of S.\r\nThesaurus, the other of S. Gregory VII. which are valuable, as Cipriani\r\npainted but little. His excellence lay in design, which he acquired from\r\nthe collection of the studies of Gabbiani, before mentioned. Having\r\nafterwards gone to London, he was much employed by the celebrated\r\nBartolozzi, who has immortalized the painter by engraving his\r\ninventions. We might augment our catalogue with the two Giusti and\r\nMichele Paoli, a Pistoian of the school of Crespi; but they did not\r\nattain maturity, if we depend on the information afforded by the\r\ncontinuator of _Felsina Pittrice_.[238]\r\n\r\nOf those within the Florentine territory, the Pisans, and of those\r\nbeyond it, the artists of Lucca, yet remain to be considered. Camillo\r\nGabrieli, a scholar of Ciro, was the first who transplanted the style of\r\nCortona into Pisa; and in this manner executed a good oil painting at\r\nthe convent of the Carmelites, and also several for private individuals;\r\nin this kind of painting he was more happy than in fresco. In this line,\r\nhowever, his memory is honoured in his native place, both for his works\r\nin the grand saloon of the Alliata palace, and in the apartments of\r\nother noblemen's houses; and likewise on account of his pupils, the two\r\nMelani, who have contributed much to his reputation. We shall notice\r\nFrancesco among the professors of architectural design: Giuseppe his\r\nbrother, and a knight of the golden spur, became no common artist in\r\nfigures, and was worthy of painting in the cathedral a large oil picture\r\nof the death of S. Ranieri. Although this piece ranks in the scale of\r\nmediocrity in this sanctuary of the arts, it does honour to its author;\r\nthe invention is good, the perspective is regular, and exhibits no marks\r\nof carelessness, as is so often the case. But his place is among the\r\npainters in fresco; in which department he ornamented with figures the\r\narchitectural works of his brother; and has shewn himself tenacious of\r\nthe manner of Cortona, both in what is commendable in it, as the\r\nperspective, colouring, and harmony; and also where it is less\r\npraiseworthy, as in the heaviness and imperfect finish of the figures.\r\n\r\nWith a similar instance we shall commence the series of artists of\r\nLucca: the two brothers, Ippolito and Giovanni Marracci, obtained equal\r\napplause in very different branches of the art; the former was a painter\r\nof architecture, the latter of figures; and of him only we shall here\r\nspeak. Although little known beyond Lucca, he is reckoned among the\r\neminent scholars and most successful imitators of Pietro da Cortona; and\r\nmerits this name, either when he painted in fresco, as in the cupola of\r\nS. Ignatius, at S. Giovanni; or when he wrought in oil, as he did in\r\nseveral pictures in the possession of the brotherhood of S. Lorenzo, in\r\nthe collegiate church of S. Michael, and in other places. With equal\r\nsuccess two other artists, natives of Lucca, who had been educated in\r\nhis school, became imitators, for a period, of Pier Cortona. These were\r\nGiovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi, who were trained in the school of\r\ntheir native place, and resembled each other no less in style than in\r\ndisposition; so that though they usually painted in the same piece, all\r\ntheir joint labours appear the work of a single artist. They afterwards\r\nadopted a manner that participates of the Venetian and Lombard schools;\r\nand in this style they painted the vast ceiling of the library of S.\r\nGiorgio Maggiore at Venice. Rome possesses some of their stupendous\r\nworks in the church of the Lucchesi, and in the magnificent Colonna\r\ngallery. The most celebrated picture with which they ornamented their\r\nnative place was the fresco of the tribune of the church of S. Martin,\r\nand next to it that in S. Matthew's, which they decorated with three oil\r\npictures. After the death of Coli, his companion resided and continued\r\nto paint in Lucca: the whole cloister of the Carmelite monastery was\r\npainted by him alone.\r\n\r\nThe manner of Cortona was likewise adhered to by Gio. Batista Brugieri,\r\na scholar of Baldi and of Maratta, who was in his day highly applauded\r\nfor his works in the chapel of the Sacrament, at the Servi, and his\r\nother productions in public. P. Stefano Cassiani, from the fraternity to\r\nwhich he belonged, surnamed Il Certosino, or the Carthusian, painted in\r\nfresco the cupola of his church, and two large histories of our Lady,\r\nbesides other reputable works in the style of Cortona, at the Certosa of\r\nPisa, of Siena, and elsewhere. Girolamo Scaglia, a disciple of Paulini\r\nand of Gio. Marracci, is surnamed Parmegianino. In architecture he\r\nimitated Berrettini, as is remarked by Sig. da Morrona;[239] in his\r\nshadows he followed Paulini, and sometimes approached Ricchi: as a\r\npainter his effect was superior to his design; or as it was observed by\r\nthe Cav. Titi, (p. 146) on beholding his picture of the Presentation,\r\npainted at Pisa, it exhibits extreme industry and very little taste.\r\nGio. Domenico Campiglia was reckoned among the best designers in Rome;\r\nand of him the engravers of antiquities particularly availed themselves.\r\nHe was not without merit as a painter; and in Florence, where he\r\nexecuted some pictures, his portrait has a place among those of eminent\r\nartists. A picture painted by Pietro Sigismondi, of Lucca, for the great\r\naltar of S. Nicholas in Arcione at Rome, is honourably mentioned by\r\nTiti: I know not whether any of his works remain in his native place;\r\nand the same is the case with Massei and with Pini, who will be\r\nconsidered in another school.\r\n\r\nI shall close this series with two other artists; and had the age\r\nproduced many like them, Italian painting would not have declined so\r\nmuch as it has done during the eighteenth century. Giovanni Domenico\r\nLombardi lived not, like his pupil, Cav. Batoni, within the enlightening\r\nprecincts of Rome, but in merit he was at least equal to Batoni. He\r\nformed his style on the works of Paulini, and improved it by studying\r\nthe finest colourists at Venice, and also by paying attention to the\r\nschool of Bologna. The genius of this artist, his taste, his grand and\r\nresolute tone, appear in several of his pictures, executed in his best\r\ntime, and with real pains. Such are his two pieces on the sides of the\r\nchoir of the Olivetani, which represent their founder, S. Bernard,\r\nadministering relief to the citizens infected with the plague. There are\r\ntwo others in a chapel of S. Romano, which are painted with a magic\r\nforce approaching to the best manner of Guercino; and one of them, in\r\nthe opinion of the most rigid critics, seems the work of that artist\r\nhimself. He should always have painted thus; and never have prostituted\r\nhis pencil to manufacture pieces at all prices. Batoni, who will be\r\nnoticed in our third book among the Roman masters, supported better his\r\nown dignity and that of the art. He adhered in a great measure to the\r\nmaxims of this school, a circumstance which did not altogether please\r\nhis first master, who on examining some of his early performances,\r\nremarked, that they required a greater covering of dirt, for they appear\r\nto him too trimly neat. One who has not an opportunity of examining his\r\ncapital works, may satisfy himself in Lucca, either in the church of the\r\nOlivetine fathers, where he painted the Martyrdom of S. Bartolommeo; or\r\nin that of S. Catharine of Siena, where she is represented receiving the\r\nmystic wounds of the crucifixion.\r\n\r\nI shall not here mention many artists in the inferior walks of the art.\r\nThe example of Cortona influenced none in this class, except a few\r\nornamental painters, and some artists who accompanied their figures by\r\nlandscapes. The painters of landscapes, flowers, and the like, continued\r\nto follow their original models. Chiavistelli, for instance, has been\r\nfollowed by various artists in fresco of this age, who besides executing\r\nfigures, have exercised, as before remarked, other branches of painting.\r\nPure architectural and ornamental painting in a good taste are, however,\r\ndistinct arts; and to attain excellence in them requires all the\r\nfaculties of man. Angiol Rossi, of Florence, applied himself to it, as I\r\nbelieve, in Bologna; and assiduously practised it at Venice, as we are\r\ninformed by Guarienti. Two artists of Lucca, Pietro Scorzini and\r\nBartolommeo Santi, received their education at Bologna, and were the\r\nfavourite decorators of many theatres. Francesco Melani, of Pisa,\r\nadhered strongly to Cortona. As learned in perspective as his brother\r\nwas in figures, his style was so similar, that no architectural painter\r\nwas so well suited to accompany the figures of the other. This will be\r\nallowed by all who view the ceiling in the church of S. Matthew at Pisa,\r\nwhich is their finest work, or their paintings in Siena, and at other\r\nplaces, where they were employed together. They educated a pupil worthy\r\nof them, in Tommaso Tommasi, of Pietra Santa, a man of vast conception,\r\nwho succeeded in Pisa to the commissions bestowed upon his masters, and\r\nproduced very pleasing specimens of his powers in the nave of the church\r\nof S. Giovanni. Ippolito Marracci, of Lucca, the scholar of Metelli,\r\nappears a successful rival of his master, either when he painted by\r\nhimself, as in the Rotonda, at Lucca, or when associated with his\r\nbrother, as was generally the case. Domenico Schianteschi, a disciple of\r\nBibieni, lived in San Sepolcro; his perspectives in that city are to be\r\nseen in the houses of many of the nobility, and are much esteemed.\r\n\r\nFlorence has boasted professed portrait painters, even to the present\r\ntime; among whom Gaetano Piattoli is particularly extolled. He was pupil\r\nto a French artist, Francesco Riviera, who had resided and died at\r\nLeghorn, and was very much prized in collections for the excellence of\r\nhis Conversazioni and Turkish ballets. He is well known too, in other\r\ncountries; for he was employed to take portraits of the foreign nobility\r\nwho visited Florence. The portrait of himself, which he painted for the\r\nducal gallery, indicates the style of the rest. An illustrious female\r\nartist emanated from the school of Gabbiani, although assisted in her\r\nstudies by other masters, and this was Giovanna Fratellini, who was not\r\nwithout invention, and was most expert in portrait painting. She\r\nexecuted in oil, in crayons, in miniature, and in enamel, various\r\nportraits of the family of Cosmo III. and of other princes, to paint\r\nwhom she was sent by her sovereign to several cities of Italy. That\r\nwhich she painted of herself, is in the ducal gallery: in it she has\r\nblended the employment of the artist with the affection of a mother. She\r\nis represented in the act of taking a likeness of Lorenzo, her only son\r\nand pupil, who died in the flower of his age. It is painted in crayons,\r\nan art in which she may be called the Rosalba of her time. Domenico\r\nTempesti, or Tempestino, is rather included among engravers than\r\npainters; though he was instructed by Volterrano in Florence, in the\r\nlatter art, and exercised it with credit both in landscape and portrait.\r\nHe is mentioned by Vianelli in the catalogue of his pictures. It would\r\nappear that he was the same Domenico de Marchis, called Tempestino, whom\r\nOrlandi casually notices in the article of Girolamo Odam, whom Domenico\r\nhad initiated in the elements of landscape painting. Orlandi gives also\r\na separate article, under the head of Domenico Tempesti, in which his\r\nvoyages through Europe, and his long residence at Rome, are dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nMany landscapes, chiefly rural views, painted by Paolo Anesi, are\r\ndispersed through Florence, and there are also many of them in Rome.\r\nFrancesco Zuccherelli, a native of Pitigliano, born in the year 1702,\r\nwas his scholar. On going to Rome, he resided there a long time, and\r\nfirst entered the school of Morandi, and afterwards of Pietro Nelli. His\r\nfirst intention was to study figures, but by one of those circumstances\r\nwhich discover the natural predilection, he applied himself to painting\r\nlandscape; and pursued it in a manner that united strength and\r\nsweetness; and has been highly extolled not only in Italy, but over all\r\nEurope. His figures also were elegant, and these he was sometimes\r\nemployed to introduce in the landscapes and architectural pieces of\r\nother artists. His principal field in Italy was Venice, where he was\r\nsettled, until the celebrated Smith made him known in England, and\r\ninvited him to that island, in which he remained many years, exercising\r\nhis pencil for the court, and for the most considerable collections of\r\npictures. He enjoyed the particular esteem of Count Algarotti; in the\r\npossession of whose heirs are two landscapes by Tesi, with figures by\r\nZuccherelli: of the first artist I shall again speak in the school of\r\nBologna. Algarotti was commissioned by the court of Dresden to procure\r\nthe works of the best modern painters, and suggested to Zuccherelli\r\nsubjects for two pictures, in which he succeeded admirably, and was\r\nemployed to repeat them for the king of Prussia. In his old age he\r\nreturned to Rome, and was employed there, at Venice and in Florence,\r\nwhere he died in 1788. These anecdotes of Zuccherelli I obtained along\r\nwith many others from the Sig. Avvocato Lessi, a gentleman deeply versed\r\nin the fine arts.\r\n\r\nThe name of this artist brings to a fair conclusion the series of\r\nFlorentine painters, which has been continued for little less than six\r\ncenturies, in an uninterrupted succession of native artists, without the\r\nintervention of one foreign master in this school, at least one so\r\neminent as to mark an era. With the exception of the last years, in\r\nwhich art was on the decline throughout Italy, the Florentine school,\r\nwith all its merit, and that is undoubtedly very great, owes its\r\nprogress to native genius. It was not unacquainted with foreign artists,\r\nbut from them it disdained to borrow; and its masters never adopted any\r\nother style on which they did not engraft a peculiarity and originality\r\nof manner.\r\n\r\nI might write much in praise of masters now living,[240] but I propose\r\nnot to enter on their merits, and shall leave them wholly to the\r\njudgment of posterity. In other arts I indulge a greater latitude, but\r\nnot frequently. I may add with truth, that during the course of six\r\ncenturies, the artists of Florence have been fortunate in a government\r\nmost auspicious to the fine arts. The last princes however of the\r\nMedicean family had shewn more inclination than activity in patronizing\r\nthem; and the reign of the Emperor Francis I., though generally\r\ndistinguished for enterprize,[241] was nevertheless that of an absent\r\nsovereign. The accession of the Grand Duke Peter Leopold to supreme\r\npower in Tuscany, in 1765, marked a new era in the history of the arts.\r\nThe palace and royal villas were repaired and embellished; and amid the\r\nsuccession of undertakings that attracted the best artists, painting was\r\ncontinually promoted. The improvement of the ducal gallery was most\r\nopportune for it; and afforded new commissions to painters, and new\r\nspecimens of the art: for the Prince ordered all the inferior pieces to\r\nbe removed from the collection, and their place to be supplied by vast\r\nnumbers of choice pictures. Fine specimens of antique marbles were\r\nlikewise added: to him Florence owes the Niobe of Praxiteles,[242] the\r\nApollo, and other statues; the basso-relievos, and busts of the Caesars,\r\nwhich complete the grand series in the corridore: the cabinets of the\r\ngallery were then only twelve in number, and they contained a confused\r\nassemblage of paintings, statues, bronzes, and drawings, antiquities and\r\nmodern productions. He reduced this chaos to order; he separated the\r\ndifferent kinds, assigned separate apartments to each, made new\r\npurchases of what was before wanting, and increased the number of\r\ncabinets to twenty-one. This great work, one branch of which he was\r\npleased to commit to my charge,[243] was worthy of record. I laid it\r\nbefore the public, in 1782, in a memoir, which was inserted also in the\r\nforty-seventh volume of the Journal of Pisa. Whoever compares this book\r\nwith the Description of the Gallery, published in 1759, by Bianchi, will\r\nclearly perceive that Leopold was rather a second founder than a\r\nrestorer of that emporium of the fine arts: so different is the\r\narrangement, so remarkable are the additions to the building, to its\r\nornaments, and to the articles it contains.[244] I have been diffuse in\r\nmy description of the antiquities which appeared to me deserving of more\r\nparticular elucidation; of the pictures I merely indicated the artist\r\nand the subject. Since that period, other descriptions of the gallery,\r\nby very able writers, have been given to the public, in which my\r\nnomenclature and expositions of the antiquities have been adopted; but a\r\nfuller and better catalogue of the paintings is given on the plan of\r\nthat of the imperial cabinet of Vienna, and similar works.\r\n\r\nFerdinand III. who now for five years has promoted the welfare of\r\nTuscany, succeeded no less to the throne of his august father, than to\r\nthe protection of the fine arts. The new buildings already completed, as\r\nthe right wing of the Pitti palace, or now begun, as the vestibule of\r\nthe Laurentian library, which is to be finished upon a design of\r\nMichelangiolo, are matters foreign to my subject. Not so, however, are\r\nthe additions made by the prince to the gallery and the academy of\r\ndesign. To the first he has added a vast number of prints and pictures\r\nof those schools in which it was formerly deficient; and the gallery is\r\nincreased by a collection of Venetian and another of French masters,\r\nwhich are separately arranged in two cabinets.[245] The academy, since\r\n1785, had been as it were created anew by his father; had obtained a new\r\nand magnificent edifice, new masters, and new regulations, circumstances\r\nalready well known over Europe, and here unnecessary to be repeated.\r\nThis institution, which required improvement in some particulars, has\r\nbeen at length completed, and its apartments and its splendour augmented\r\nby the son; seconded by the superintendence of those accomplished\r\nconnoisseurs, the Marchese Gerini, the Prior Rucellai, and the Senator\r\nAlessandri. To the artists in every branch of the fine arts which were\r\nbefore in Florence, he has recently added the engraver Sig. Morghen, an\r\nornament to the city and the state. The obligations of the fine arts to\r\nFerdinand III., are eloquently stated by Sig. Cav. Puccini, a nobleman\r\nof Pistoia, and superintendant of the ducal gallery, in an oration on\r\nthe arts, pronounced not long ago in this academy, of which he is the\r\nrespected secretary, and since published, accompanied by\r\nengravings.[246]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: Life of Matteo Rosselli, in tom. x. p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: Tiraboschi, Storia della Lett.

Although the portraits,\r\nand in general the figures, of a variety of colours, are very pleasing,\r\nyet the _dicromi_, or yellow figures upon a black ground, attract most\r\nnotice, copied from ancient vases formerly called Etruscan, and these\r\ncopies either form separate pictures, or are inserted for ornament in\r\ntablets. The tragic poet Alfieri caused his epitaph to be inscribed on\r\none of these small tables covered with scagliola work. Being found after\r\nhis death, it quickly spread abroad, but was not inscribed on his tomb.\r\nUpon another of these he had written the epitaph of a great personage,\r\nwhom he wished to be interred near him; and the two little tablets\r\nunited together folded one upon another in the way of a _dittico_ or\r\nsmall altar, or of a book, on the side of which was written _Alfieri\r\nliber novissimus_. In this way others write, on tablets of scagliola,\r\nfine precepts from scripture, a philosophy that comes from and leads to\r\nheaven, intended to be placed in private sanctuaries, to aid meditation\r\nin sight of the crucifix. The silver tablets I have seen for the same\r\npurpose are more valuable, but less artificial.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: In his larger works (such as the altar-pieces at the\r\nMissionari and at the Monastero Nuovo,) it would appear that Conti aimed\r\nat approaching the style of Trevisani.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: See _Saggio Istorico della R. Galleria de Firenze_, tom.\r\nii. p. 72. This work, valuable for its learning and authenticity, is\r\nwritten by Sig. Giuseppe Bencivenni (formerly Pelli) a gentleman of\r\nFlorence, and formerly director of the ducal gallery, who is also known\r\nby his other literary labours, on the lives of the most eminent\r\npainters, by the life of Dante, and by the learned dissertation on\r\ncoins, appended to the lives of the followers of Cortona. He arranged\r\nthe collection of modern coins, that of engravings and of drawings, and\r\nthe paintings of the ducal gallery; of these, and also of the gems and\r\nmedals, he has there left manuscript catalogues.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: See that work at p. 232.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Tom iii. p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: It was necessary to confine myself thus in the preceding\r\nedition. In the present we may give free scope to our commendation of\r\nTommaso Gherardini, a Florentine, and pupil to Meucci; and who, having\r\ncompleted his studies in the schools of Venice and Bologna, succeeded\r\nadmirably in basso-relievo and chiaroscuro. He decorated a large hall in\r\nthe Medicean gallery in fresco, and painted likewise much in oil for the\r\nimperial gallery of Vienna, for German and English gentlemen, and\r\nvarious countries that have ornamented their collections. He shewed, at\r\nleast for his age, no less skill in fresco histories, which are seen in\r\nmany Florentine palaces and villas. The best of these are such as he\r\nexecuted in mature age, or at his own suggestion; like his _Parnaso in\r\nToscana_, placed in the Casa Martelli, one of his patrons from his early\r\nyears; besides others in the noble houses of Ricciardi and Ambra. He\r\ndied in 1797; the senator Martelli, on the decease of the Archbishop his\r\nuncle, and that of his father, continued his patronage to the artist,\r\nand considers him as one who has reflected the greatest degree of credit\r\non his house. The clients of that family, from the time of Donatello,\r\nhave been numerous, a taste for the fine arts being hereditary in the\r\nfamily. The master of the academy, Pietro Pedroni, ought not to be here\r\nomitted; an oil painter of merit, whose four pictures, executed\r\nsubsequent to his studies at Parma and Rome, are an ornament to his\r\nnative place. Owing to ill health, he produced little during his\r\nresidence at Florence, which, added to other disappointments, induced\r\nhim, always the best resource, to travel. If not a rare painter, he was\r\nat least an able master: profound in theory, and eloquent in conveying\r\nhis knowledge to his pupils, of whom history will treat in the ensuing\r\nage. Their success, their affection and esteem for Pedroni, is the best\r\neulogy on him which I can transmit to posterity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: See _Il Saggio Istorico_ of Sig. Pelli, towards the\r\nconclusion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: See _Le Notizie su la Scoltura degli antichi e i vari\r\nsuoi stili_, p. 39. This short tract, illustrative of many marbles in\r\nthe ducal gallery, is inserted in the third volume of _Saggio di Lingua\r\nEtrusca_. It was intended as a preface to a full Description of the\r\nMuseum, which was then in the press, but it was suspended in consequence\r\nof the numerous changes and additions made in that place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: It was the cabinet of antiquities, not then arranged. In\r\neach class I have noticed the additions of Leopold. To the busts of the\r\nCaesars I was able to add about forty, some of which had been purchased,\r\nand others removed from the royal palaces and villas. See the\r\nDescription above quoted, p. 34. The collection of heads of philosophers\r\nand illustrious men was almost all new. I give an account of it in p.\r\n85. The series of busts of the Medicean family was completed at the same\r\ntime, and Latin inscriptions were added, which are to be found in\r\nvarious descriptions of the gallery, with some errors, that are not to\r\nbe attributed to me, but to the printers; and this remark applies to\r\nother royal epitaphs, as published in many books.

Cav.\r\nPuccini, from whom I understand, that almost a third of the pictures now\r\nin the gallery were placed there by the munificence of Ferdinand. Sig.\r\nPuccini has arranged them in a manner so symmetrical and instructive as\r\nto form a model for all other collections.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: In 1801 Lodovico I. began his reign in Tuscany. Dying\r\nshortly after, he was succeeded by the infant Carlo I., under the\r\nregency of the Queen-mother Maria Louisa. From this period the arts have\r\nexperienced new patronage and encouragement. The very copious and select\r\nSalvetti library has been appropriated for the use of the academy; a\r\nnoble example to all parts of Italy, possessing similar institutions. A\r\nnew improvement also here made, is the reunion in one place of masters\r\nin scagliola, and mosaic work, gems, and the restoring of pictures, an\r\noccupation recently introduced; and in place of a master, who formerly\r\npresided, a director, with greater authority and emolument, has been\r\nappointed. Sig. Pietro Benvenuti, whom I dare not venture to commend as\r\nhe deserves, for he is still living, was selected for this charge. The\r\naddition of casts also by our new rulers is of great utility, in\r\nparticular those from the works of the celebrated Canova, who has been\r\nrequested to produce a new statue of Venus, on the model of the\r\nMedicean, lost to us by the chance of war. The honour conferred by the\r\nqueen regent upon the arts, deserves likewise a place in history; who,\r\nin the meeting of the academy, held in 1803, Sig. Alessandri being\r\npresident, distributed rewards to the young students, and encouraged\r\nthem to do well. It was upon this occasion that the same Cavaliere\r\nPuccini, secretary to the institution, delivered another excellent\r\ndiscourse, intended to prove that the pursuit of the fine arts forms one\r\nof the most expeditious and least perilous paths to human glory;--a\r\ndiscourse that, equally for the credit of the writer and of the fine\r\narts, was given to the world at Florence, in the year 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  SIENESE SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EPOCH I.\r\n\r\n  _The old Masters._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sienese is the lively school of a lively people; and is so agreeable\r\nin the selection of the colours and the air of the heads, that\r\nforeigners are captivated, and sometimes even prefer it to the\r\nFlorentine. But this gaiety of style forms not the only reason of this\r\npreference; there is another, which few have attended to, and none have\r\never brought forward. The choicest productions of the painters of Siena\r\nare all in the churches of that place; and he who wishes to become\r\nacquainted with the school, after having seen these, need not be very\r\nsolicitous to visit the private collections, which are numerous and well\r\nfilled. In Florence it is otherwise: no picture of Vinci, of Bonarruoti,\r\nof Rosso, is to be seen in public; none of the finest productions of\r\nAndrea, or of Frate, and few of any other master who has best supported\r\nthe credit of the school: many of the churches abound in pictures of the\r\nthird and fifth epochs; which are certainly respectable, but do not\r\nexcite astonishment like the works of the Razzi, the Vanni, and other\r\nfirst rate artists, every where to be met with in Siena. They are,\r\nmoreover, two different schools, and ought not to be confounded together\r\nin any work of art; possessing, for a long period of time, different\r\ngovernments, other heads of schools, other styles; and not affected by\r\nthe same changes. A comparison between the two schools is drawn by P.\r\ndella Valle,[247] whom we have mentioned, and shall afterwards mention\r\nwith respect; and his opinion appears to be, that the Florentine is most\r\nphilosophical, the Sienese the most poetical. He remarks on this head,\r\nthat the school of Siena, from its very beginning, displays a peculiar\r\ntalent for invention; animating with lively and novel images the stories\r\nit represents; filling them with allegory, and forming them into\r\nspirited and well constructed poetic compositions. This originates in\r\nthe elevated and fervid genius of the people, that no less aids the\r\npainter, whose poetry is addressed to the eye, than the bard who yields\r\nit to the ear. In the latter, and also in extemporary poets, the city\r\nabounds, and still maintains in public estimation, those laurels, which,\r\nafter Petrarca and Tasso, her Perfetti won in the capital. He likewise\r\nobserves that those artists particularly attended to expression. Nor was\r\nthis difficult, in a city so adverse to dissimulation as Siena, whose\r\nnatural disposition and education have adapted the tongue and\r\ncountenance to express the emotions of the heart. This vivacity of\r\ngenius has perhaps prevented their attaining perfection in design, which\r\nis not the great attribute of those masters, as it is reckoned of the\r\nFlorentines. To sum up all, the character of the school of Siena is not\r\nso original as that of some others; and we shall find, during its best\r\nperiod, that some of its artists distinctly imitated the style of other\r\npainters. With regard to the number of its artists, Siena has been\r\nprolific in the proportion of its population; its artists were numerous\r\nwhile it had many citizens; but on the decrease of the latter, its\r\nprofessors of the fine arts also diminished, until every trace of a\r\nschool was lost.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the early painters of Siena are rather confused during\r\nthe three first centuries by the plurality of the Guidi, the Mini, the\r\nLippi, the Vanni (abbreviations of Giacomo, Filippo, Giovanni), and such\r\nsort of proper names as are used without a surname: hence it is not\r\nsufficient to peruse only such accounts; we must reflect on them and\r\ncompare them. They are scattered in many histories of the city,\r\nespecially in Ugurgieri, who was pleased to entitle his work _Le Pompe\r\nSanesi_; in the Diary of Girolamo Gigli; and in several works of the\r\nindefatigable Cav. Gio. Pecci, whom we have before noticed. Many\r\nmanuscripts, rich in anecdotes of painting, still remain in the\r\nlibraries: of this number are the histories of Sigismondo Tizio, of\r\nCastiglione, who lived at Siena from 1482 to 1528; _the Cathedral of\r\nSiena_, minutely described by Alfonzo Landi; the _Treatise on old_\r\n_Paintings_ of Giulio Mancini; and some _Memoirs_ of Uberto\r\nBenvoglienti, whom Muratori denominates _diligentissimus rerum suae\r\npatriae investigator_. From these, and other sources,[248] P. della Valle\r\nhas drawn what is contained in the Lettere Sanesi, and repeated in the\r\nnotes on Vasari concerning the school of Siena. By the work of Della\r\nValle it has acquired a celebrity to which it has long been entitled. I\r\ntake him for my guide in the documents and anecdotes which he has given\r\nto the public;[249] in the older authorities I follow Vasari and\r\nBaldinucci in many circumstances, but dissent from them in others: and\r\nhostile to error, and anxious for the truth, I shall pursue the same\r\nplan with regard to the historians of the school of Siena. I shall omit\r\nmany names of old masters, of whom no works now remain, and here and\r\nthere shall add a few modern artists who have come to my knowledge, by\r\nthe examination of pictures, or by the perusal of books.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Sienese school is deduced either from the crusades in\r\nthe east, whence some Grecian painter has been brought to Siena; or from\r\nPisa, which, as we have seen, had its first artists from Greece. On such\r\na question every one may judge for himself: to me the data necessary for\r\nresolving it appear to be wanting. I know that Italy was never destitute\r\nof painters, and artists who wrought in miniature; that from such,\r\nwithout any Grecian aid, or example, some Italian schools took their\r\norigin. Siena must have had them in the twelfth century. The _Ordo\r\nofficiorum Senensis Ecclesiae_ which is preserved in the library of the\r\nacademy at Florence, was written in the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and exhibits initial letters, surrounded with illuminations of\r\nlittle stories and ornaments of animals. They are painted in vermilion,\r\nin a very hard and meagre style; but they are valuable on account of\r\ntheir era, 1213, in which they were executed by Oderico Canonico of\r\nSiena.[250] Similar books were ornamented by the same painter in the\r\nparchment of the leaves, and painted on the covers without;[251] and\r\nafford a proof that thus the art of ornamenting with miniatures might\r\nlead to large compositions. All, however, more or less, savour of the\r\nGreek design; either because the Italians were originally disciples of\r\nthe Greeks, dispersed over Italy, or because they regarded the Grecian\r\nmasters as models, and ventured not to attempt much beyond them.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient pictures in the city, the Madonna _of the Graces_, the\r\nMadonna of Tressa, the Madonna of Bethlehem, a S. Peter in the church\r\ndedicated to that saint, and a S. John the Baptist, surrounded by many\r\nsmall historical representations at S. Petronilla, are believed to be\r\nolder than 1200; but it is by no means clear that they are the works of\r\nItalians, though often believed such from their initial characters,\r\nplaister, and design. On the two last the names of the saints near the\r\nfigures are in Latin characters; a circumstance, however, which does not\r\nprove an Italian painter. On the mosaic works at Venice, on the Madonna\r\nof Camerino, brought from Smyrna,[252] and on other pictures executed by\r\nthe Greeks for Italian cities, ignorant of their language, they wrote,\r\nor got others to write, inscriptions in Latin; and they did the same on\r\nstatues.[253] The method of painting on gilt plaister, which we observe\r\nin some old pictures, decidedly Italian, is no argument; for I have\r\nseveral times observed a similar practice in what was unquestionably the\r\nwork of a Greek artist. The drawing of the features in those pictures,\r\nthe grimness of the aspect, and the composition of the stories, all\r\naccord with the productions of the Greeks. They may, therefore, have\r\nbeen painted by Greek artists, or by a scholar, or, at least, by an\r\nimitator of the Greeks. Who, then, can determine whence the artist came,\r\nwhether he was a restorer of painting, and whether he executed those\r\npaintings at Siena, or sent them from some other place? This is certain,\r\nthat painting quickly established itself at Siena, sent out roots, and\r\nrapidly multiplied its blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe series of painters known by name commences with Guido, or Guidone,\r\nalready noticed in the beginning of this volume. He flourished before\r\nCimabue of Florence saw the light; and seems to have been at the same\r\ntime an illuminator of manuscripts and a painter. The writers of Siena\r\nhave declaimed against Vasari and Baldinucci for omitting this artist;\r\nnotices of whom could not have escaped the former, who was many times at\r\nSiena; nor the latter, who was made acquainted with them before the\r\npublication of his _Decennali_. Cav. Marmi, a learned and celebrated\r\nFlorentine, thus notices the omission in one of his letters.[254]\r\n\"Baldinucci laboured to make us credit the restoration of painting by\r\nCimabue and Giotto; and to give stability to his hypothesis, it is\r\nprobable that he omitted to make any mention of the painters who,\r\nindependent of the two just named, departed from the raw and feeble\r\nmanner of the Greeks.\" And Guido certainly left it not a little behind,\r\nin his picture of the Virgin, now hung up in the Malevolti chapel in the\r\nchurch of S. Domenico. On it he has thus inscribed his name and the\r\ndate:\r\n\r\n  _Me Guido de Senis diebus depinxit amenis\r\n  Quem Christus lenis nullis velit agere poenis_.\r\n\r\n         An. 1221.\r\n\r\nAnd this example was often followed by the masters of this school, to\r\nthe great benefit of the history of painting. The countenance of the\r\nVirgin is lovely, and participates not in the stern aspect that is\r\ncharacteristic of the Greeks; we may discover some trace of a new style\r\nin the drapery. The Madonnas of Cimabue which are at Florence, the one\r\nin the church of the Trinity, the other in S. Maria Novella, are not,\r\nhowever, inferior. In them we may discern the improvement of the art; a\r\nmore vivid colouring, flesh tints more true; a more natural attitude of\r\nthe head of the infant, while the accompaniments of the throne, and of\r\nthe glory of angels, proclaim a superior style.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I make two remarks, in which I widely dissent from the\r\nopinion of the author of the Sienese Letters, without committing any\r\nbreach of our long established friendship. The one is, that to prove\r\nGuido superior to Cimabue, he frequently compares the Madonna of S.\r\nDomenico, which is the only one of his pictures which he mentions,[255]\r\nwith the paintings of Cimabue, which are numerous, and full of subject;\r\nand without setting any value on the colouring, the fertility of\r\ninvention, and the various other qualities in which the Florentine\r\nsurpassed the artist of Siena, he dwells on certain little particulars,\r\nin which it appears that Guido was superior. An artist of whom it is not\r\nknown that he ever attempted any picture but Madonnas, might become more\r\nor less perfect in this subject; but painting is not so much indebted to\r\nhim, as to one who has carried it to the higher walks of the art; a\r\nmerit which Marco of Siena, a writer not inclined to favour the\r\nFlorentines, denies not to Cimabue, as we shall find in the fourth book.\r\nThe other circumstance alluded to is, that when he mentions a picture\r\nwhich does honour to the fame of Cimabue, he attempts to discredit its\r\nhistory, and the tradition; as I have already observed with regard to\r\nthe two large pictures in the church of Assisi, and am now under the\r\nnecessity of remarking with regard to the two Madonnas at Florence\r\nabove mentioned. He \"strongly suspects\"[256] them to be the work of Mino\r\nda Turrita, since mosaic, in which Mino was expert, is there represented\r\nby a skilful hand; and Cimabue was not dexterous in that art; as if a\r\npainter could not represent buildings without being an architect, or\r\ngarments without knowing how to cut them out, or drapery without being\r\nversed in the art of weaving. He even doubts whether Giotto visited\r\nFrance, for, had this been the case, he, and not Simone da Siena, would\r\nhave painted the portrait of Laura, as if history did not inform us that\r\nGiotto visited that country about 1316, long before the period when\r\nPetrarca first became enamoured of that beauty. He has introduced some\r\nother speculations, which he would not have admitted, had he not been\r\nbetrayed into it, almost involuntarily, by a system which has some\r\nprobable foundation, but is carried to an extravagant length. I should\r\nhave been silent on this subject; but when writing of these artists it\r\nbecame me to recollect that the _unicuique suum_ was no less the duty of\r\nthe historian than the judge.\r\n\r\nThe authors of chronicles require correction on the era of this painter.\r\nThe most undoubted picture of Guido is that bearing the date 1221, for\r\nthe other in the church of S. Bernardino, dated 1262, is ascribed to him\r\nwithout sufficient evidence. It is hardly probable that he who was so\r\neminent in a new art in 1221, was still alive in 1295, as is affirmed by\r\nsome,[257] on the faith of a sum of money paid to one Guido, a painter.\r\nThe celebrated Guido must then have been at least 105 years of age: it\r\nis more probable that he was dead, and the name applied to another\r\nGuido, without any danger of a mistake.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that the elder Guido instructed F. Mino, or\r\nGiacomino da Turrita, the celebrated artist in mosaic, of whom we have\r\nspoken in the first book. On the era of Mino also much has been written\r\nwithout sufficient authority. Baldinucci says he died about 1300; and\r\nomits to mention in his life that he was employed in 1225; although this\r\ndate is legible on the mosaic of Mino in the church of S. Giovanni at\r\nFlorence, in letters a cubit in length.[258] This circumstance has\r\nlikewise escaped the historians of Siena, some of whom have prolonged\r\nhis life to the year 1298, on the authority of payment made to Minuccio,\r\na painter; and others have extended it to about 1200, on account of the\r\ntomb of Boniface VIII. which is said to be the work of Turrita. The\r\nutmost period that can be granted them is about 1290: for Titi observes,\r\nin his _Description of the Paintings in Rome_, that Mino finished the\r\nmosaic of S. Maria Maggiore in 1289, and died, after beginning another\r\nin S. Giovanni Laterano, which was completed by Gaddo Gaddi in 1292.\r\nThis renders it extremely doubtful that F. Mino was taught painting by\r\nGuido, that he imparted it not only to Giotto, whom, for other reasons,\r\nwe have excluded from his school (p. 20) but to the Sienese artists,\r\nMemmi and Lorenzetti,[259] and even that he was a painter; all which is\r\nfounded on the following memorandum, under the year 1289, in a\r\nmanuscript in the library of Siena: \"Paid on the twelfth day of August,\r\nnineteen lire to Master Mino, the painter, who painted the Virgin Mary,\r\nand other SS. in the council room of the public palace, the balance,\r\n&c.\"\r\n\r\nHe who is here denominated _Maestro_ Mino, not Fra Mino; who is\r\nsometimes called Minuccio, a diminutive not fitted for an old monk; and\r\nappears to have been employed in Siena when Fra Mino was at Rome, is\r\nanother artist. Thus we discover another eminent painter of the name of\r\nMino, or Minuccio, who seems to be in reality the author of the picture\r\nof 1289, above alluded to, which remained in the council hall even\r\nwithin my memory, and of others, down to 1298. He there represented the\r\nVirgin and Child, surrounded by angels, and under a canopy, supported by\r\nApostles and the patron saints of the city. The size of the figures, the\r\ninvention and the distribution of the work, are surprising for that age;\r\nof the other qualities one cannot speak with certainty; for it was\r\nrepaired in 1321 by Simone da Siena, and there are beauties in the\r\nfeatures and the drapery that can be ascribed only to the restorer. The\r\nmistake thus occasioned by the same name being cleared up, the system of\r\nthe learned author of the Lettere Sanesi, is in part confirmed, and in\r\npart falls to the ground. He is right in refusing to Giotto certain\r\nSienese pupils, referred to him only from traces of a more modern style;\r\nfor we here discover an artist who made some advances towards the new\r\nmanner even previous to Giotto, who, in 1289, was only thirteen years of\r\nage. Now this Mino, and Duccio, of whom we shall soon treat, might\r\ncertainly have formed pupils able to compete with the school of Giotto,\r\nand even in length of years to surpass Giotto himself. There is no\r\nreason, however, to prefer the Sienese painters to Cimabue, on the\r\nstrength of this painting, as the author in question has so often done.\r\nComparison ought to be employed between painter and painter, between\r\ncontemporary and contemporary. F. Mino, to whom this single picture was\r\nattributed, is now shewn to have been merely a mosaic worker: Mino or\r\nMinuccio began to be known when Cimabue was fifty years of age; and is\r\nthe author of a single work, not so free from retouches, nor so large as\r\nthat of Assisi, already described. The comparison then is not just.\r\n\r\nEvery school thinks itself sufficiently honoured when it can produce two\r\nor three painters of the thirteenth century: the school of Siena is\r\npeculiarly rich in them, and these are recorded in the twenty-fifth\r\nletter _On the disciples of Guido_. As usual I shall omit the names of\r\nthose least entitled to recollection. I will not affirm that all of them\r\nproceeded from the school of Guido; for in a city where the fine arts\r\nflourished so rapidly, masters unknown to us may have been produced.\r\nMuch less will I ascribe artists of other cities to this school. In the\r\nmanuscripts of Mancini, one Bonaventura da Lucca is mentioned, who is\r\nthe Berlingieri already mentioned.[260] I neither assign him to Guido\r\nnor to Giunta. Who can tell whether Lucca had not also in those early\r\ntimes an original school, now unknown to us? Setting aside uncertain\r\npoints therefore, we can only assert, that after the middle of the\r\ncentury, Siena abounded in painters, more, perhaps, than any other city\r\nof Italy; and the causes of this are as follows.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral was begun several years before, in a style of magnificence\r\nsuited to the lordly views of the citizens. It was not a work to be\r\ncompleted in a short time: hence it was frequently interrupted, and a\r\nlong period had elapsed before it was finished. During this time many\r\narchitects (_magistri lapidum_) and sculptors either were invited from\r\nother places, or were reared up in the city; and in 1250 they formed a\r\ncorporate body, and required particular laws.[261] Although nothing is\r\nascertained with regard to their mode of study, it is natural to suppose\r\nthat the study of sculpture contributed to the advancement of painting,\r\na sister art. The celebrated battle of Monte Aperto, in which the people\r\nof Siena defeated the Florentines, happened in 1260. This victory\r\nproduced an era of peace and opulence to the city, and encouraged both\r\nin public and in private the arts depending on luxury. The victory was\r\nascribed to the interference of the blessed Virgin Mary, to whom the\r\ncity was consecrated; the adoration of her votaries increased, and her\r\nimages were multiplied in the streets, and in all other places; and\r\nthence painting obtained fresh encouragement, and new followers.\r\n\r\nUgolino da Siena should be referred to this era; he died decrepid in\r\n1339, and consequently might have been born before 1260. We cannot agree\r\nwith Vasari, who insinuates that he was the scholar of Cimabue; nor with\r\nBaldinucci, who ingrafts him on his _Tree_; nor yet with others who\r\nassert that he was the pupil of Guido; for the latter must have been\r\ndead when Ugolino was very young. That he was educated in Siena, seems\r\nto me highly probable, from the number of masters then in that city, and\r\nbecause the colouring of his Madonna of Orsanmichele at Florence is in\r\nthe style of the old school of Siena; less strong and less true than\r\nthat of Cimabue and the Florentines. This fact appears to me of\r\nimportance, for it depends on the mechanism of the art, which was\r\ndifferent in different schools. Design at that early period savoured\r\nmore or less of the Greeks; and in this respect Ugolino adhered to them\r\ntoo closely. \"He painted pictures and chapels over all Italy,\" says\r\nVasari; and if I am not mistaken he came to Florence after his travels,\r\nand at length died at Siena.\r\n\r\nDuccio di Boninsegna is another master of this age, of whom I shall\r\nspeak in another place, as the inventor of a new species of painting.\r\nTizio says he was the pupil of Segna, an artist now almost unknown in\r\nSiena. He must, however, have enjoyed great celebrity in his day among\r\nhis countrymen; for Tizio informs us that he painted a picture at\r\nArezzo, containing a figure which he pronounces excellent and highly\r\nesteemed. He has transmitted to us the following remarkable testimony\r\nconcerning Duccio: \"_Ducius_ Senensis inter ejusdem opificii artifices\r\nea tempestate primarius; ex cujus officina veluti ex equo Trojano\r\npictores egregii prodierunt.\"\r\n\r\nThe _ea tempestate_ refers to 1311, when Giotto was at Avignon; and when\r\nDuccio was employed on the picture that still exists in the opera-house,\r\nwhich was completed in three years, and almost forms an era in the art.\r\nIt was large enough to have formed a picture for the great altar of the\r\nmetropolitan church for which it was intended. On the side facing the\r\npeople he painted large figures of the Virgin, and of various saints; on\r\nthat fronting the choir he represented scriptural subjects, in many\r\ncompartments, in which he introduced a vast number of figures a palm in\r\nlength. Pius II. relates in his Annals of Siena, which were never\r\npublished, that it cost 2,000 florins; others raise it to 3,000; but not\r\nso much on account of the workmanship as the profusion of gold and\r\nultramarine. The style is generally thought to approach the Greek\r\nmanner; the work, however, is the most copious in figures, and among the\r\nbest executed productions of that age. Duccio was employed in many parts\r\nof Tuscany, and in the church of the Trinity at Florence he painted an\r\nAnnunciation which, in the opinion of Baldinucci, \"leaves no doubt that\r\nhe was a scholar of Giotto, or of his disciples.\" But this will not be\r\ngranted or believed by those who have seen it; for both the colouring\r\nand the style are totally dissimilar. Chronology, too, opposes the\r\nconclusion; unless we introduce here also a confusion, arising from\r\nartists with similar names: Duccio painted from 1282,[262] and died\r\nabout 1340.[263]\r\n\r\nThe history becomes more complete, when we arrive at the celebrated\r\nSimone Memmi, or Simone di Martino,[264] the painter of Laura, and the\r\nfriend of Petrarca, who has celebrated him in two sonnets that will hand\r\nhim down to the latest posterity. The poet has also eulogized him in his\r\nletters, where he thus speaks: \"duos ego novi pictores egregios ...\r\nJoctum Florentinum civem, cujus inter modernos fama ingens est, et\r\nSimonem Senensem;\" which is not, however, comparing him to Giotto, to\r\nwhom he pays a double compliment, but it is giving Memmi the next rank.\r\nIn such a convenient place the poet would not, in my opinion, have\r\nomitted _Jocti discipulum_, had he been acquainted with such a\r\ncircumstance: but he appears to have no knowledge of it; and this\r\nrenders it doubtful whether Simone was the pupil of Giotto at Rome,\r\nnotwithstanding the assertion of Vasari, who adds that the latter was\r\nthen engaged in the mosaic of the _Navicella_. The writers of Siena\r\ncontradict him with good reason; for in 1298 Simone was only fourteen\r\nyears of age.[265] They reckon him the scholar of their Mino, and\r\ncertainly he derived much from the large fresco before noticed: but as\r\nhe retouched it himself we cannot put much faith on the resemblance. His\r\ncolouring is more vivid than that of the followers of Giotto, and in\r\nfloridness it seems a prelude to Baroccio. But if he was not the scholar\r\nof Giotto, he may have assisted him in some of his works, or, perhaps,\r\nstudied him closely, as many eminent painters have often done with the\r\nbest masters. This may account for his imitating Giotto so admirably in\r\nS. Peter's at Rome; a merit which procured him an invitation to the\r\npapal court at Avignon, where he died. The picture of the Vatican has\r\nperished; but some of his other works still exist in Italy; and they are\r\nnot so numerous at Siena as in Pisa and Florence. In the Campo Santo of\r\nPisa we find various actions of S. Ranieri, and the celebrated\r\nAssumption of the Virgin, amid a choir of angels, who seem actually\r\nfloating in the air, and celebrating the triumph. Memmi was excellent in\r\nthis species of composition, as I believe, from the numerous pictures of\r\nthis subject which he painted at Siena, where there is one at the church\r\nof S. John, which is more copious but not more beautiful than that at\r\nPisa. Some of his larger works may be seen in the chapter house of the\r\nSpanish Friars at Florence; several histories of Christ, of S. Domenico,\r\nand of S. Peter Martyr; and there the Order of the Preaching Friars are\r\npoetically represented as engaged in the service of the church, in\r\nrejecting innovators, and in luring souls to paradise. Vasari, to whom\r\nthe inventions of Memmi appear \"not those of a master of that age, but\r\nof a most excellent modern artist,\" especially praises the last: and,\r\nindeed, it might be supposed that it was suggested by Petrarch, did not\r\na comparison of dates refute such an idea. The picture was painted in\r\n1332, and Simone went not to France till 1336; what is said about the\r\nportrait of Laura in the chapterhouse is a mere fable. Taddeo Gaddi, an\r\nundoubted pupil of the improved and dignified school of Giotto, was\r\nthere his competitor; and as far surpassed Memmi in the qualities of\r\nthat school, as he was excelled by the latter in spirit, in variety of\r\nthe heads and attitudes, in fancy of the draperies, and in originality\r\nof composition. Simone paved the way to more complex pictures, and\r\nextended them over a whole facade, so as to be taken in at one glance of\r\nthe eye; whereas Giotto used to divide a large surface into many\r\ncompartments, in each of which he painted an historical picture.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not usually dwell on miniature painting, I cannot resist\r\nmentioning one which is to be seen in the Ambrosian library at Milan,\r\nwhich appears to me a singular production. In that place, there is a\r\nmanuscript of Virgil, with the commentary of Servius, which formerly\r\nbelonged to Petrarca. In the frontispiece is a miniature that is\r\nreasonably conjectured to have been suggested to Simone by the poet, who\r\nhas subjoined the following verses:\r\n\r\n  _Mantua Virgilium qui talia carmina finxit,_\r\n  _Sena tulit Simonem digito qui talia pinxit._\r\n\r\nThe artist has represented Virgil sitting in the attitude of writing,\r\nand with his eyes raised to heaven, invoking the favour of the Muses.\r\nAEneas is before him in the garb and with the demeanour of a warrior,\r\nand, pointing with his sword, intimates the subject of the AEneid. The\r\nBucolics are represented by a shepherd, and the Georgics by a\r\nhusbandman; both of whom are on a lower foreground of the piece, and\r\nappear listening to the strain. Servius, in the mean time, appears\r\ndrawing aside a veil of great delicacy and transparency, to intimate\r\nthat his readings unveil what would otherwise have remained obscure and\r\ndoubtful to the reader of that divine poet. An account of this picture\r\nis contained in a letter of the secretary Ab. Carlo Bianconi,[266] where\r\nthe author praises the originality of the idea, the colouring and\r\nharmony of the picture, the propriety and variety in the costume\r\naccording with the subject. He also remarks a little rudeness in the\r\ndesign, more of truth than of beauty in the heads, and the largeness of\r\nthe hands; that usually, indeed, were the characteristics of every\r\nschool at this period.\r\n\r\nSimone had a relation named Lippo Memmi, whom he himself instructed in\r\nthe art. Although he was not equal in genius to Simone, he succeeded\r\nadmirably in imitating his manner, and, aided by his designs, produced\r\npictures that might have passed for the work of the former, had he not\r\ninscribed them with his name. When he wrought without such assistance\r\nthere is a manifest mediocrity in his invention and design; but he is\r\nstill a good colourist. A picture executed by them both is preserved in\r\nS. Ansano di Castelvecchio of Siena.[267] In Ancona, Assisi, and other\r\nplaces, pictures existed that were begun by the former, and finished by\r\nthe latter. There is a picture wholly the work of Lippo in Siena; and\r\nthe author of the Description of Pisa records one at the church of S.\r\nPaul in that place, which is not without merit. In my first edition,\r\nimplicitly following the writers of chronicles, I mentioned a Cecco di\r\nMartino as the brother of Simone. But on considering that he flourished\r\nabout 1380, and that there was a less celebrated Simon Martino, in\r\nSiena, about 1350, mentioned by Cittadini, I do not judge it right to\r\nfollow their authority.\r\n\r\nAn artist named Lorenzo, and familiarly Lorenzetto, was the father of\r\nanother family of painters: he had a son named Ambrogio, who is surnamed\r\nLorenzetti by historians. A large picture by this artist, on which he\r\nsubscribes himself _Ambrosius Laurentii_, is to be seen in the public\r\npalace, and may be designated a poem of moral precepts. The vices of a\r\nbad government are there represented under different aspects, and with\r\nappropriate symbols; accompanied by verses explanatory of their nature\r\nand consequences. The Virtues, too, are there personified with suitable\r\nemblems: and the whole is adapted to form governors and politicians for\r\nthe republic, animated by the spirit of genuine patriotism alone. Had\r\nthere been a greater variety in the countenances of the figures, and a\r\nsuperior arrangement in the piece, it would have been little inferior to\r\nthe finest pictures in the Campo Santo of Pisa. Siena possesses many of\r\nhis frescos and large pictures; but they are not so surprising as his\r\nsmaller works, in which he appears as the forerunner of B. Angelico,\r\nwhom we have commended in another place. I have observed nothing similar\r\nin his contemporaries; and it possesses a nationality of character that\r\nprevents his being confounded with the followers of Giotto: the ideas,\r\nthe colouring, and the draperies, are wholly different. In a similar\r\ntaste is a picture in the possession of Sig. Abate Ciaccheri, librarian\r\nto the university of Siena, where Ambrogio painted some very original\r\nworks, in which he very far surpassed the Orcagni. His style was admired\r\nin Florence; where, to please his friends, who were desirous of seeing a\r\nspecimen of his art, he painted several pieces from the life of S.\r\nNicholas, in the church of S. Proculus, that were afterwards transferred\r\nto the abbey.\r\n\r\nAnother son of Lorenzo was called Pietro, and, in conjunction with his\r\nbrother, painted the Presentation, and Nuptials of Our Lady, in the\r\nhospital of Siena, on which the following inscription was legible: _Hoc\r\nopus fecit Petrus Laurentii et Ambrosius ejus frater, 1335_. The\r\ninscription is preserved by Cav. Pecci, who in 1720, when the painting\r\nwas destroyed, transcribed it most opportunely for correcting Vasari,\r\nwho had read _Petrus Laurati_ instead of _Laurentii_ in another\r\ninscription; from which he concluded this artist not to be the brother\r\nof Ambrogio; and from some similarity between his style and that of\r\nGiotto, had concluded that he was the disciple of the latter: but it is\r\nhighly improbable that with such a father and such a brother, Pietro\r\nwould have gone from home for instruction. Vasari gives, however, a most\r\nfavourable opinion of this illustrious Sienese, which may suffice to\r\nvindicate his impartiality. He says of one of his pictures, \"that it was\r\nexecuted with a better design and in a superior manner to any thing that\r\nTuscany had then seen;\" and in another place he asserts, that Pietro\r\n\"became a better master than either Cimabue or Giotto.\" What could he\r\nhave said further? might it have been asserted that he was, if not the\r\ndisciple of Giotto, at least his fellow student in the school of F.\r\nMino? (Vasari, tom. ii. p. 78. ed. Sen.) But granting that Giotto was\r\nnot his master, how are we to believe him his fellow student? The first\r\npictures of Giotto are traced to 1295; those of Pietro to 1327. And\r\nwhere, when, or to whom did F. Mino teach painting? Pietro's historical\r\npicture of the Fathers dell' Eremo remains in the Campo Santo of Pisa,\r\nwhere, in conformity with ecclesiastical history, he has painted the\r\nvarious discipline of those recluses. This picture, if I am not\r\nmistaken, is richer in ideas, more original, and better conceived than\r\nany one in that place. In the ducal gallery there is a copy of this\r\npicture, if not a duplicate by the artist himself: the taste of the\r\ncolouring certainly belongs not to the Florentine, but to the Sienese\r\nschool, of that period.\r\n\r\nAfter painting had attained so high a degree of excellence in Siena, it\r\nwas liable to decline, both from the usual lot of the most auspicious\r\neras, to which an age of servile imitation, and of hurried execution,\r\ngenerally succeeds, and also from the terrible plague which, in 1348,\r\ndesolated Italy and Europe; sweeping off distinguished masters and\r\npupils in every school. Siena, however, did not lose her Lorenzetti, who\r\nconstituted her ornament for several years; but if her population at one\r\ntime equalled 75,000, it was afterwards greatly diminished. She could,\r\nhowever, still vie in the number of her artists with Florence itself.\r\nThis clearly appears from _The Statutes of the Painters of Siena_,[268]\r\npublished by P. della Valle, in his first volume, letter sixteen. They\r\nare drawn up with the characteristic simplicity, clearness, and\r\nprecision of the thirteenth century; and are a very admirable body of\r\nregulations for the due propriety and direction of artists, and for the\r\nhonour of the art. We can discern that this society consisted of\r\ncultivated and well educated persons; and it does not excite\r\nastonishment to find that, democratic in government as Siena then was,\r\nthe highest magistrates of the republic were sometimes elected from\r\namong the professors of the art. They formed a body-corporate; not\r\nmerely a fraternity, nor an academy of design; and received their\r\ncharter, not from the bishop but from the city, or the republic in 1355.\r\nSome have conjectured that those statutes are as old as the preceding\r\ncentury; and that they were translated into Italian from the Latin about\r\n1291: for Tizio informs us that, in this year, \"Statuta materna lingua\r\nedita sunt ad ambiguitates tollendas.\" But Tizio must have meant the\r\nstatutes concerning wool, and others then existing; and those of the\r\nartists may have been framed at a subsequent period. Indeed, the manner\r\nin which they are drawn up, without a reference to preceding ordinances,\r\nindicates a first edition. If there were statutes published in the\r\nvulgar tongue in 1291, why was the sanction of the law deferred for 66\r\nyears? or why are the new not distinguished from the old, as is usual in\r\nsimilar codes?\r\n\r\nIn the code to which I refer, the names of a great number of artists are\r\ninscribed, who lived after 1350 and at the beginning of the next\r\ncentury. With the exception of a few who merit some consideration I\r\nshall pass them over in silence as I did in the Florentine school. I\r\nfind among them Andrea di Guido,[269] Jacomo di Frate Mino, and Galgano\r\ndi Maestro Minuccio; and I bring these forward to confirm what I have\r\nbefore observed, that painters of the same name have introduced\r\nconfusion into the history of this school. I also find there N. Tedesco,\r\nVannino da Perugia, Lazzaro da Orvieto, Niccolo da Norcia, Antonio da\r\nPistoia, and other foreign artists: thence I infer that Siena, like a\r\nuniversity for painting, had furnished masters to various cities of\r\nItaly, and other countries. We here meet with some painters of whom\r\nthere still remains some trace in history, or in the inscriptions on\r\npictures. Martino di Bartolommeo is the artist who, in 1405, painted the\r\nTranslation of the Body of S. Crescentius at the cathedral, and of whom\r\na still better picture remains at S. Antonio Abate. His family name\r\nbrings to mind Bartolommeo Bolonghino, or Bolgarino, mentioned by Vasari\r\nas the best pupil of Pietro Laurati, and the painter of some excellent\r\npictures in Siena, and other parts of Italy. He was a man of rank, and\r\nobtained the honour of the magistracy. Andrea di Vanni is undoubtedly\r\nthe painter of the S. Sebastian in the convent of S. Martin, and of the\r\nMadonna surrounded by saints in that of S. Francis; an artist not\r\nunknown beyond the limits of his native country, especially in Naples,\r\nwhere he painted before 1373. He was likewise employed in public\r\nembassies, and, like another Rubens, was a magistrate, and ambassador of\r\nthe republic to the Pope: and was honored by S. Catherine of Siena, who,\r\nin one of her letters, gives him some excellent advice on the subject of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1370 flourished Berna, (i. e. Bernardo) da Siena, of whom\r\nVasari says, that \"he was the first who painted animals correctly;\" and\r\nat the same time allows him no common merit in the human figure,\r\nespecially in what regards expression. One of his frescos remains in the\r\nparish church of Arezzo, more praiseworthy on account of the\r\nextremities, in which he was superior to many of that age, than for the\r\ndrapery or the colouring, in which many artists surpassed him. He died\r\nin the prime of life, about the year 1380, at S. Gimignano, after having\r\nmade considerable progress in a copious work, consisting of some\r\nsubjects from sacred history, that still remains in that parish church.\r\nThe work was continued with a superior colouring, but with a less pure\r\ndesign, by Giovanni d'Asciano, who is his reputed scholar. The whole\r\nstill exists, and thirteen of the pictures, or perhaps more, are the\r\nwork of the scholar who exercised his art at Florence, under the\r\nprotection of the Medicean family, much respected by his fellow artists.\r\nAs those two painters lived long abroad, I find no mention of them in\r\nthe catalogue just quoted. There is a well executed altar-piece in\r\nVenice, with the name _Bernardinus de Senis_. Some of his pictures have\r\nbeen discovered in the diocese of Siena, by the Archbishop Zondadari,\r\nwho has formed a good collection of ancient pictures of the Sienese\r\nschool. In these pictures Berna appears to be a pretty good colourist, a\r\ntalent which he does not display in his frescos. Luca di Tome, another\r\nscholar of Berna, noticed by Vasari, is there mentioned. One of his Holy\r\nFamilies remains at S. Quirico, in the convent of the Capuchins, and\r\nbears the date of 1367. It has not sufficient softness, but in other\r\nrespects is very reputable.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the fifteenth century, not only individual painters,\r\nbut whole families of artists had multiplied, in which the art for a\r\nlong series of years descended from father to son. This circumstance\r\ncontributed greatly to the progress of painting: for the master, who is\r\nlikewise the father, teaches without any feeling of jealousy, and\r\ngenerally aims at forming a pupil superior to himself. The family of the\r\nFredi, or the Bartoli, became celebrated beyond all the rest. The\r\nreputation of Taddeo, who began to be distinguished in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, rose very high. In the records he is styled _Thaddaeus magistri\r\nBartholi magistri Fredi_,[270] from his father[271] and grandfather,\r\nartists of some name. By him, \"as the best master of the age,\" says\r\nVasari, the chapel of the public palace was painted, where some\r\nhistorical pieces representing our Lady, are yet to be seen; and in 1414\r\nhe ornamented the adjoining hall. Besides some pictures from sacred\r\nhistory, he there formed, as it were, a gallery of illustrious men,\r\nchiefly republicans; and for the edification of the citizens, added some\r\nLatin and Italian verses; a mode of instruction very liberally employed\r\nin this school. The chief merit of the work lies in the dignity and\r\noriginality of its invention, which was afterwards imitated in part by\r\nPietro Perugino, in the hall of the Exchange, at Perugia. The portraits\r\nare ideal; they are dressed in the costume of Siena, even when they\r\nrepresent Romans and Grecians, and their attitudes are not happy. His\r\npictures at Pisa and in Volterra, mentioned by Vasari, still exist; and\r\nthat of the Arena in Padua, in the tribune of the church, is well\r\npreserved. In it we discover practical skill, little variety, and less\r\ngrace in the heads, feeble tints, and imitations of Giotto, that lose\r\ntheir value on a comparison with the original. Some of his small\r\npictures do him greater honour; and in them an imitation of Ambrogio,\r\nhis great prototype, is conspicuous, and also the subdued but agreeable\r\ncolouring of this school; which, like all the others in Italy, excelled\r\nabout this period more in small than in large proportions.\r\n\r\nThe manner of Taddeo was first pursued and afterwards meliorated, and\r\ngreatly aggrandized by Domenico Bartoli, his nephew and disciple.\r\nForeign connoisseurs behold with delight the various fresco pictures\r\nwhich he painted in the pilgrim's ward of the hospital, representing the\r\ncircumstances of its foundation, and the exercises of christian charity\r\nbestowed upon the sick, the dying, and the indigent. On comparing these,\r\none with another, the artist displays considerable improvement, and a\r\ngreater freedom than usual from the old dryness: his design and\r\nperspective are better, his compositions more scientific; without taking\r\ninto account the richness and variety of ideas, which he has in common\r\nwith the artists of this school. From those pictures Raffaello and\r\nPinturicchio, while painting at Siena, took many of their notions of\r\nnational costume, and, perhaps, of some other particulars: for it is\r\ncharacteristic of great minds to derive advantage even from examples not\r\nabove mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThus the art was gradually advancing in the republic, when new\r\nopportunities were afforded for producing works on a grand scale;\r\noccasions in which genius is developed and invigorated. Siena gave Pius\r\nII. to the chair of S. Peter, who, to the most ardent love of his\r\ncountry, united a taste for magnificence; and during his residence in\r\nthe city, it was embellished with architecture, and every kind of\r\nornament. He would have been still more profuse, had he not, disgusted\r\nwith the ingratitude of the people, turned his attention and beneficence\r\nto Rome. Among other advantages he conferred on the state of Siena, was\r\nthat of adding to its territory the city of Corsignano, his native\r\nplace; which from him was afterwards called Pienza. The new city\r\nreceived from him another form, and new edifices, among which was the\r\ncathedral. It was erected in 1462, and for its decoration he invited the\r\nbest artists of Siena, Ansano and Lorenzo di Pietro, Giovanni di Paolo,\r\nand Matteo his son. Their style was laborious and minute; the universal\r\ncharacter of that age: for the manner of painting was introduced and\r\ntransferred from one country into another, without our being able to\r\ndiscover where it originated; but in the arts depending on design, as we\r\nhave before remarked, when the path is once opened, the natural genius\r\nof each school will regulate its further progress. These four artists\r\nare mentioned in the catalogue of Sienese artists; and Ansano, or Sano,\r\nat one time enjoyed the highest reputation. About 1422 he had painted\r\nthe beautiful fresco which still remains over the Roman gate; and which\r\nrepresents the Coronation of the Virgin: it is much in the style of\r\nSimone, and in some respects it surpasses him. A picture by this artist\r\nof inferior merit remains in the church of Pienza. Lorenzo di Pietro,\r\nsurnamed Il Vecchietta, was eminent in sculpture and in casting in\r\nbronze; and he is noticed by Vasari. He was less successful in painting,\r\nand offends by hardness, as far as we can determine from the small\r\nremains of him in Siena, for there are none existing at Pienza. A\r\npicture of his, with the date 1457, was lately added to the Medicean\r\ngallery. Giovanni di Paolo makes a good figure in Pienza; and a still\r\nbetter in a Descent from the Cross, painted four years afterwards in the\r\nOsservanza of Siena; in which the defects of the age are counterbalanced\r\nby qualities, at that time by no means common, displaying a considerable\r\nknowledge of the naked figure.\r\n\r\nMatteo di Giovanni was then young, but surpassed them all in the extent\r\nof his genius. This is the Matteo denominated by some the Masaccio of\r\nthis school, although there is a great distance between him and the\r\nFlorentine Masaccio. The new style of Matteo begins to be recognized in\r\none of his two pictures in the cathedral. He afterwards improved it in\r\nhis works in the church of S. Domenico, at Siena, in Madonna della Neve,\r\nand in some other churches; and it was he who first excited the\r\nNeapolitan school to attempt a less antiquated style. Having learnt the\r\nprocess of painting in oil, he imparted sufficient softness to his\r\nfigures; and from his intimacy with Francesco di Giorgio, a celebrated\r\narchitect,[272] he imbibed a good taste in buildings, and diversified\r\nthem very ingeniously with alto and basso-relievos. He foreshortened\r\nlevel objects well; he cast draperies with more of nature, and with less\r\nfrippery than was common in that age; if he imparted little beauty to\r\nthe features, he attained, at least, variety of expression; and was\r\nsufficiently attentive in marking the muscles and veins in his figures.\r\nHe did not always aim at novelty and display in his invention; on the\r\ncontrary, after painting a Murder of the Innocents, which was his best\r\ncomposition,[273] he often repeated it in Siena, and in Naples, but\r\nalways with improvements: his most studious picture on this subject is\r\nthat at the Servi of Siena, painted in 1491, which must have been near\r\nthe close of his life. He was accustomed to introduce into his pictures\r\nsome episode, unconnected with the principal story, in small figures, a\r\nstyle in which he excelled. The noble house of Sozzini and some other\r\nfamilies in Siena, possess several of his small pictures. As an artist,\r\nhe is inferior to Bellini, to Francia, or Vannucci; but surpasses many\r\nothers. Another eminent Sienese, who flourished in the first ages of oil\r\npainting, is made known to us by Ciriaco Anconitano,[274] who was\r\nacquainted with him in 1449, at the court of Leonello, Marquis of Este.\r\nThis artist was named Angelo Parrasio: he painted the nine muses in the\r\npalace of Belfiore, near Ferrara, in imitation of the manner of Giovanni\r\nand Ruggieri da Bruggia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: See Lettere Sanesi, tom. ii. let. 23, addressed to the\r\nauthor of this work.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: See _Lett. Sen._ tom. ii. p. 23, et sequent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: In regard to these documents the public is much indebted\r\nto the Abate Ciaccheri, the learned librarian of the city, who employed\r\nhimself for many years in collecting them; but his eyes failing him, it\r\nbecame necessary that others should publish them: the excellent\r\nhistorian has frequently made mention of him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: The work was published by Trombelli, at Bologna, in 1766.\r\n_Della Valle_, tom. i. p. 278. What he adds, that this very Oderico may\r\nbe the Oderigi da Gubbio, noticed by Dante in the xith canto of his\r\nPurgatorio, ought not to be admitted. Dante might, for the sake of\r\nrhyme, change Oderico into Oderigi; but he has said, in the middle of\r\nthe verse, that the celebrated miniature painter was a native of Gubbio.\r\nMoreover, the latter, who died about 1300, could not have painted in\r\n1213.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: See Della Valle, tom. ii. p. 273.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: This is an Annunciation, with the following verse:\r\n\r\n_Virgo parit Christum velut Angelus intimat ipso._\r\n\r\nThe error in the last word stands on the picture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: Hard by the cathedral of that city there are two lions,\r\non one of which, in a mixture of Greek and Latin characters, is written,\r\n\r\n  M_a_h_ister_ Th_exde fevit_ (fecit) & _fevit fieri ambos istos_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: See Lettere Sanesi, tom. i. p. 243.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: Tom. ii. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: P. 288.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: See Lett.

In the genuine books at S.\r\nDomenico, of Siena, we find this sentence \"Magister Simon Martini pictor\r\nmortuus est in curia; cujus exequias fecimus ... 1344.\" Since Vasari\r\napproaches so near the truth in the time of the painter's death, we may\r\nreasonably credit him also in his age. Mancini says he was born about\r\n1270; which gives occasion for P. della Valle to mention Simone as a\r\ncontemporary, and a competitor of Giotto at Rome. I cannot agree with\r\nhim on this date, and the information drawn by him from books belonging\r\nto the Sienese hospital, that Simone was in Siena in 1344, only a few\r\nmonths before his death, at the court of the Pope at Avignon,\r\nstrengthens my opinion. I cannot believe that an old man of seventy-four\r\nwould transfer his residence from Siena to Avignon. If we credit Vasari\r\nthe difficulty vanishes, inasmuch as Simone, being then scarcely sixty,\r\nmight be equal to undertake so long a journey.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: See Lett.

It\r\nmay be remarked on the chronology of this painter, that where we find\r\nnot Memmi but only Lippo or Filippo, it does not always seem intended\r\nfor him. Thus the M. Filippo, who received a sum of money in 1308, and\r\nthat Lippo, who, in 1361, is said to be the assistant of another artist,\r\n(Lett. Sen. tom. ii. p. 110), most probably are not to be identified\r\nwith Memmi. He was younger than his relation, and according to Vasari,\r\nsurvived him 14 years.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: _Statuti dell' arte de' Pittori Senesi._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: This Guido da Siena is, perhaps, the one mentioned by\r\nSacchetti in his eighty-fourth tale, and of whom there remains a picture\r\nin the church of S.

The origin and progress of the\r\n  modern style in that city._\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore this era we have met with no strangers who had taught painting,\r\nor had changed the manner of this school. The art had there existed for\r\nthree centuries, always, or almost always,[275] under the guidance of\r\nnative painters; and it had even been provided by the statutes of the\r\nart, that no foreigner might be encouraged to practise it at Siena. In\r\none chapter it is enacted, that \"any stranger, wishing to be employed,\r\nshall pay a florin;\" and elsewhere, that \"he may receive a just and\r\nsufficient recompense to the extent of twenty-five livres.\" The\r\nprovision was subtle: on the one hand they did not, with a marked\r\ninhospitality, positively exclude strangers; but, on the other, they\r\ndeprived them of any chance of rivalling the artists of the city in\r\nemployment at Siena. Hence it came to pass, according to P. della Valle,\r\nthat no pictures of other schools, but those of a late period, are to be\r\nfound there. But this circumstance, though favourable to the artist,\r\nwas, in no small degree, detrimental to the art: for the school of\r\nSiena, by admitting strangers, would have swelled the list of her great\r\nmasters; and she might have kept pace with other schools; but this she\r\nneglected, and, after having vied with the Florentine school in\r\npainting, and even surpassed it for some years, towards the close of the\r\nfifteenth century Siena could not, perhaps, boast of a better artist\r\nthan Capanna, who executed some facades from the designs of others;[276]\r\nor than Andrea del Brescianino, who, in conjunction with one of his\r\nbrothers, is said to have painted some pictures, with which I am\r\nunacquainted, in the church of the Olivetine Friars. They have been more\r\ncommended by historians than Bernardino Fungai, an artist whose style\r\nwas modernized, but dry,[277] than Neroccio, or any other Sienese\r\npainter of that period; but they could not be compared to the best\r\nmasters of Italy. The nobility perceived the decline of the native\r\nschool, and the necessity of supporting it by the accession of foreign\r\nartists; they wished for such assistance, to the dissatisfaction,\r\nprobably, of the populace, every where apt to contend that the provender\r\nof the land should rather feed the native beast of burden than the\r\nforeign steed. The Florentine style of painting found its way to Rome;\r\nbut ancient rivalry and political jealousy prevented its introduction\r\ninto Siena. Perugia seemed a less objectionable ally; and from that\r\nplace, first Bonfigli, and afterwards his scholar Pietro Perugino, who\r\nexecuted two pictures at Siena, were invited; and at length several\r\nscholars also of the latter were called, who long remained in the\r\nservice of two celebrated natives of Siena. The one was Cardinal\r\nFrancesco Piccolomini, who soon after became Pius III. For the purpose\r\nof decorating the sacristy of the cathedral, and the chapel of his\r\nfamily, with various pictures from the life of Pius II. he invited\r\nPinturicchio to Siena, and this artist carried along with him other\r\nscholars of Perugino, and even Raffaello himself, who is reported to\r\nhave designed either wholly, or in a great measure, those historical\r\npictures. The other was Pandolfo Petrucci, who, for some time, usurped\r\nthe government of the republic: eagerly desirous of embellishing the\r\npalace and some churches, he availed himself of Signorelli, and of\r\nGenga,[278] and recalled Pinturicchio.\r\n\r\nThis passed at the beginning of the sixteenth century; for the sacristy\r\nwas completed in 1503; the return of Pinturicchio took place in 1508;\r\nand, after a short interval, it appears that Genga, the scholar of\r\nPerugino, and Signorelli, came to Siena. From that period, the Sienese\r\nschool began to assume the modern style; and design, a full tone of\r\ncolouring, and perspective, all attained perfection in a few years. Had\r\nSiena produced a family equal to the Medicean in taste, power, and a\r\ndisposition to encourage the fine arts, what might it not have attained!\r\nSiena about this time could boast of four men of talents admirably\r\nadapted to produce a great revolution in the art, and these were\r\nPacchiarotto, Razzi, Mecherino, and Peruzzi, all of whom (with the\r\nexception of Razzi), Baldinucci, for some reason unknown to me, has\r\nderived from the school of Raffaello. The works of Raffaello, then a\r\nyoung man, and of other foreign artists, far from repressing their\r\nspirit, awakened in them an honourable emulation. Whoever compares the\r\npictures of Matteo with their works, would conclude that many years had\r\nintervened; yet they were all living at the death of Matteo. We now come\r\nto the bright era of the school of Siena; and to the consideration of\r\nits most eminent masters.\r\n\r\nJacopo Pacchiarotto[279] followed the manner of Pietro more closely than\r\nany of them, although he was not his scholar, and, perhaps, had not been\r\nout of Siena before 1535. In that year there happened an insurrection of\r\nthe people against the government of that city, in which he was a\r\nringleader, and would have suffered an ignominious death, had he not\r\nbeen saved by the Osservantine fathers, who concealed him for some time\r\nwithin a tomb. From thence he secretly withdrew to France, where he\r\nassisted Rosso, and is supposed to have died. Siena possesses several of\r\nhis cabinet pictures and altar-pieces, in the style of Perugino;\r\nespecially a very beautiful one in the church of S. Christopher. In his\r\nfrescos, in the church of S. Catherine and of S. Bernardino, where he\r\nemulated the ablest artists of Siena, he appears great in composition.\r\nThe most admired is the copious picture representing the Visit of the\r\nVirgin, S. Catherine, to the body of S. Agnes of Montepulciano: the\r\nothers are executed in a similar taste. He unquestionably appears to\r\nhave studied Raffaello with the greatest care; and there are heads and\r\nwhole figures so lively, and with such a grace in the features, that, to\r\nsome connoisseurs, they seem to possess the ideal beauty of that great\r\nartist. Nevertheless, Pacchiarotto is almost unknown beyond the limits\r\nof his native place, for he is only incidentally mentioned by Vasari;\r\nand his works have passed under the name of Perugino, or of his school.\r\n\r\nGiannantonio Razzi, surnamed Il Sodoma, undoubtedly enjoyed the\r\ncitizenship of Siena; but it is disputed whether he was born at\r\nVergelle, a Sienese village, or at Vercelli, in Piedmont. Vasari\r\nexpressly states, that he was invited to Siena by some of the noble\r\nfamily of Spannocchi, and that he was a native of Vercelli; in which\r\nopinion he is supported by Tizio, Giovio, Mancini, and all who wrote\r\nbefore Ugurgieri. I am confirmed in it by observing his carnations, his\r\nstyle of chiaroscuro, and other peculiarities of the old school of\r\nMilan, and of Giovenone, who flourished at Vercelli in the early years\r\nof Razzi; and of this style there appears to me traces in the works of\r\nGio. Antonio; especially in those he executed shortly after he had left\r\nhis master. I have not observed the historical pictures of S. Benedict,\r\nwhich he painted at Monte Oliveto about 1502, and are so ably described\r\nby Sig. Giulio Perini, secretary to the academy of Florence. I have seen\r\nthose he executed at Rome in the pontificate of Julius II. He painted\r\nseveral in the Vatican, that were defaced, because they did not satisfy\r\nthe Pope. Raffaello substituted other pictures, but spared the\r\ngrotesques. Razzi afterwards executed some pictures from the life of\r\nAlexander the Great, in the Chigi, now the Farnese palace. The nuptials\r\nof Roxana, and the suppliant family of Darius, are the best of them.\r\nThey do not exhibit the facility, grace, and dignified heads, that\r\ncharacterize the style of Vinci; but they shew much of his chiaroscuro,\r\nwhich was then greatly followed by the Lombards: perspective, their\r\nhereditary attribute, is there conspicuous; they abound in gay images,\r\nin little Cupids with their arrows, and a pomp that is captivating.\r\n\r\nHis works in Siena, the fruit of his studies in Rome, and of his mature\r\nage, are still superior. The Epiphany, in the church of S. Augustino,\r\nappeared wholly in the style of Vinci to an eminent foreign connoisseur,\r\nwho mentioned it to me with rapture. The Flagellation of Christ, in the\r\ncloister of S. Francis, is preferred to the figures of Michelangiolo by\r\nthose who are reckoned judges of the art: their unanimous opinion seems\r\nto be that Razzi never produced a finer picture. Some think as highly of\r\nhis S. Sebastian, now in the ducal gallery, which is supposed to have\r\nbeen copied from an antique Torso. The Swoon of S. Catherine of Siena,\r\nwhich he painted in fresco in a chapel of S. Domenico, is a picture in\r\nthe manner of Raffaello. Peruzzi greatly admired it, and affirmed that\r\nhe had never seen a swoon so naturally represented. The air and varied\r\nexpression in the heads of his picture, however, are not borrowed from\r\nany artist, and on this account he seems to have extorted the applause\r\neven of Vasari. His models, as was usual with the other artists of this\r\nschool, were selected from among the Sienese, whose heads possess a\r\ngreat degree of innate gaiety, openness, and spirit. He painted\r\nfrequently in a hurried manner, without any preparatory study;\r\nespecially in his old age, when reduced to poverty at Siena, he sought\r\nfor employment at Pisa, at Volterra, and at Lucca: but in all his\r\npictures I discover traces of an able artist, who, though careless of\r\nexcellence, never painted badly. Vasari, the great enemy of his fame,\r\nwho generally styles him Mattaccio,[280] has ascribed to chance, to\r\nfortune, or to fancy, whatever he performed well; as if his usual style\r\nhad been that of a bad painter. Here Vasari betrays a want of memory;\r\nfor he confessed in the life of Mecherino, that Razzi \"possessed the\r\ngrand principle of design;\" in another passage he has praised the\r\nbrilliant colouring he brought with him out of Lombardy; and before\r\nnoticing the works of his old age, he has often pronounced the others\r\nbeautiful, or sometimes _most_ beautiful and wonderful: hence it may be\r\nsaid of him, _modo ait, modo negat_. Guided by public estimation, Giovio\r\nhas written of Razzi in a different manner, when speaking of the death\r\nof Raffaello, he subjoins: \"plures pari pene gloria certantes artem\r\nexceperunt, et in his Sodomas Vercellensis.\"[281] He who objects to the\r\ntestimony of this eminent scholar, will receive that of a celebrated\r\npainter: Annibale Caracci, passing through Siena, said, \"Razzi appears a\r\nvery eminent master of the greatest taste, and (speaking of his best\r\nworks at Siena) few such pictures are to be seen.\"[282]\r\n\r\nDuring the many years that Giannantonio lived at Siena, he must have\r\neducated many pupils. A few of them only are noticed by Mancini in one\r\nof his Fragments;[283] and these are Rustico, the father of Cristofano,\r\nan excellent painter of grotesques, with which he filled Siena;\r\nScalabrino, a man of genius, and a poet;[284] and Michelangiolo Anselmi,\r\nor Michelangiol da Siena, a painter claimed by several places. We shall\r\nconsider him in the school of Parma, as he left no work in Siena, except\r\na fresco in the church of Fonte Giusta, a production of his youth, and\r\nnot worthy of so great a name. A scholar of Razzi, then his assistant,\r\nand finally his son-in-law, was Bartolommeo Neroni, otherwise called\r\nMaestro Riccio, who after the death of the four great pillars of the\r\nschool of Siena, supported its reputation for many years, and probably\r\neducated one of its restorers. He may be recognized at the Osservanti,\r\nin a Crucifixion with three saints standing around, and people in the\r\ndistance. But his masterpiece was a Descent from the Cross, much in the\r\nmanner of Razzi, at the Derelitte. Some of his other pictures yet remain\r\nin the city, in which he sometimes appears to mingle the style of his\r\nfather-in-law, with a certain resemblance to the manner of Vasari, in\r\nthe distribution of his tints. He is known to have been very excellent\r\nin perspective, and particularly so in painting scenery; a specimen of\r\nwhich was engraved by Andreani. He was also greatly skilled in\r\narchitecture, and had a pension from the magistrates of Lucca for his\r\nassistance in their public works. Some books include among his disciples\r\nAnselmi, who was rather his kinsman; and Arcangiolo Salimbeni, who\r\nfinished some of his works after his death, and on this account only has\r\nbeen supposed his scholar. From him we shall commence a new epoch in\r\nthis school.\r\n\r\nDomenico Beccafumi derived the surname of Mecherino from a citizen of\r\nSiena, who, having remarked him when a shepherd boy designing something\r\non a stone, augured favourably of his genius; and obtaining the consent\r\nof his father, brought him to the city, and according to Gigli,\r\nrecommended him to Capanna as a scholar. He there employed himself in\r\ncopying the designs of eminent artists, and in imitating the pictures of\r\nPietro Perugino, whose manner he at first adopted; nor did he ever\r\nwholly get rid of it; and his works in the cathedral of Pisa exhibit a\r\ndryness, though they are the productions of his maturer years.[285]\r\nHaving gone to Rome in the pontificate of Julius II., a new scene was\r\nopened to him in the specimens of ancient sculpture, of which he was a\r\nmost sedulous designer, and in the pictures in which Michelangiolo and\r\nRaffaello had assayed their skill. After two years he returned home, and\r\nthere continuing his close attention to design, he found himself strong\r\nenough to contend with Razzi; and, if we may credit Vasari, even to\r\nsurpass him. He had acquired skill in perspective, and was fertile in\r\ninvention as a painter. In Siena, Mecherino is ranked after Razzi; and\r\nthe many places where they vied with each other, facilitates the\r\ncomparison to those who are disposed to make it. At first he humoured\r\nhis placid disposition by painting in a sweet style; at that time he\r\nmade choice of beautiful airs for his heads; and very frequently\r\ninserted the portrait of his mistress in his pictures. In this style is\r\nhis fine picture at the church of the Olivetines of S. Benedict; in\r\nwhich he has represented the titular saint, with S. Jerome, and the\r\nVirgin S. Catherine, and where he has added some circumstances of her\r\nlife in small figures. The last annotator on Vasari prefers this work to\r\nmany other pictures of Mecherino, and laments, that, captivated by the\r\nenergy of Bonarruoti, he had deviated from his original manner. And,\r\nindeed, when he aspired to more vigour he frequently appears coarse in\r\nhis proportions, negligent in his extremities, and harsh in his heads.\r\nThis defect so increased in his old age that his heads of that period\r\nappeared without beauty even to Vasari.\r\n\r\nHis mode of colouring is not the most true; for it was mannered with a\r\nreddish hue, which is, however, fascinating and cheerful to the eye; it\r\nis neat, clear, and of such a body that it remains on walls at this day,\r\nin the highest preservation. A few of his works remain in Genoa, where\r\nhe painted the palace of Prince Doria; they are not numerous at Pisa;\r\nbut they abound in his native place, both in public and in private. His\r\nmerit was greater in distemper than in oil colouring; and his historical\r\nfrescos do him greater honour than his other paintings. His skill was\r\ngreat in distributing them to suit the place, and in adapting them to\r\nthe architecture; he ornamented them with grotesque decorations in such\r\na manner that he required not the aid of gilt stucco, or other gaudy\r\ntrappings. These inventions have such felicity, that a single glance\r\nrecals the story to the memory of one acquainted with its circumstances.\r\nHe treats his subject copiously, with dignity, and with perfect nature:\r\nhe imparts grandeur to it by his architectural views, and elegance by\r\nintroducing the usages of antiquity. He peculiarly delighted in the more\r\nrecondite principles of the art, which were then less generally\r\nemployed; as peculiar reflections of fires and other lights; difficult\r\nforeshortenings, especially as applied to ceilings, which were then very\r\nrare in lower Italy. Vasari has minutely described his figure of\r\nJustice; the feet of which are in dark shadow, gradually diminishing to\r\nthe shoulders, which are invested with a most brilliant celestial light:\r\n\"Nor is it possible,\" says he, \"to imagine, much less to find, a more\r\nbeautiful figure ... amongst all that ever were painted to appear\r\nforeshortened when viewed from below.\" According to this verdict,\r\nMecherino deserves the appellation of the Coreggio of lower Italy, in\r\nthis very difficult branch of painting; for no modern artist had\r\nattempted so much before his time. The above mentioned figure is painted\r\non the vaulted ceiling of the consistory of the government; and the\r\nartist has arranged below it various oval and square pictures, each\r\nrepresenting some memorable exploit of a republican hero. He pursued the\r\nsame idea in an apartment in the mansion now in possession of the Bindi\r\nfamily, which P. della Valle reckons his masterpiece. The figures\r\nresemble those in the _Logge_ of Raffaello: they are better coloured\r\nthan those in the consistory, and being smaller are, on that account,\r\nbetter designed: for the style of Mecherino resembles a liquor which\r\nretains its qualities when shut up in a phial, but evaporates and is\r\ndissipated when poured into a larger vessel. This circumstance, however,\r\nwas common to many others: his peculiarity consists in what he\r\ncommunicated to Vasari; that, \"out of the atmosphere of Siena, he\r\nimagined he could not paint successfully;\" an effect, according to P.\r\nGuglielmo, of the climate; which would be a happy secret for peopling it\r\nwith painters. Perhaps it is to be explained by the greater degree of\r\nquiet and tranquillity that he enjoyed at home, in the society of his\r\nfriends, among a people ready to encourage him by praise, not to chill\r\nhim by reproach, and surrounded by all the spectacles and the lively\r\ngenius of his country; objects eagerly desired by the natives of Siena,\r\nbut not easily found in other places.\r\n\r\nThe style of Mecherino, now described, expired with him: for his pupil,\r\nGiorgio da Siena, became a painter of grotesques, and imitated Gio. da\r\nUdine, both in his own country and at Rome: Giannella, or Gio. da Siena,\r\nturned his attention from painting to architecture; and Marco da Pino,\r\nsurnamed also da Siena, united a variety of styles. Baglione, and the\r\nhistorians of Siena, say, that he was there educated by Beccafumi, and\r\nBaldinucci adds, likewise by Peruzzi: P. della Valle, from his brilliant\r\ncolouring, denies him to them, and assigns him to Razzi. All, however,\r\nare agreed that he obtained his knowledge principally from Rome, where\r\nhe first painted from the cartoons of Ricciarelli or of Perino; and if\r\nwe may credit Lomazzo, was also instructed by Bonarruoti. We cannot\r\nreadily find any Florentine capable of following the precepts of\r\nMichelangiolo, without ostentation; but he acquired the principles\r\nwithout the affectation of displaying his knowledge. His manner is\r\ngrand, select, and full of elegance: it is adduced by Lomazzo as a\r\nperfect model for the human figure, and for the just distribution of the\r\nlight according to the distance of objects; a department of the art in\r\nwhich he shares the glory with Vinci, Tintoretto, and Baroccio. He\r\npainted little in Siena except a picture, with which I am not\r\nacquainted, in the mansion of the Francesconi family; and few of his\r\nworks are to be seen at Rome, with the exception of a Pieta, in an altar\r\nof Araceli, and some frescos in the church Del Gonfalone. Naples was his\r\nfield; and there he will again appear as a master and historian of that\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nIf conjecture were allowable in assigning masters to painters of the old\r\nschools, I should be inclined to reckon Daniele di Volterra rather the\r\nscholar of Mecherino, than of Razzi or Peruzzi. We know for certain that\r\nhe studied at Siena in early life, when those three artists kept an open\r\nacademy. Peruzzi was wholly a follower of Raffaello; Razzi disliked the\r\nFlorentine style; and Beccafumi alone aspired to be esteemed a faithful\r\nimitator of Bonarruoti: by regarding him, therefore, as the master of\r\nDaniele, we can best account for the already noticed predilection of the\r\nlatter for the style of Michelangiolo. No artist was capable of\r\ninitiating him better in the art of casting in bronze than Mecherino; or\r\nafford him more frequent examples of that strong opposition of bright\r\nand sombre colours that appears in some works of Daniele. Yet I will not\r\ndepart from the more correct rule which forbids us in such doubtful\r\npoints to depart readily from history: for each painter was always free\r\nto choose his style; he might be directed in one path by his master, and\r\ndrawn a different way by his own genius, or by accidental circumstances.\r\n\r\nBaldassare Peruzzi is one of the numerous individuals whose merit must\r\nnot be measured by their good fortune. Born in indigent circumstances in\r\nthe diocese of Volterra, but within the territory of Siena, and of a\r\nSienese father,[286] he was nurtured amid difficulties, and through life\r\nwas the perpetual sport of misfortune. Reckoned inferior to his rivals,\r\nbecause he was as modest and timid as they were arrogant and impudent;\r\ndespoiled of his whole property in the sack of Rome; constrained to\r\nexist on a mere pittance at Siena, at Bologna, or at Rome,[287] he died\r\nwhen he began to be known, not without suspicion of being poisoned, and\r\nwith the affliction of leaving a wife and six children almost beggars.\r\nHis death demonstrated to the world better than his life the greatness\r\nof his genius; and the justness of his epitaph, in which he is compared\r\nto the ancients, is allowed by posterity. General consent ranks him\r\namong the best architects of his age; and he would also have been\r\nclassed with the greatest painters, had he coloured as well as he\r\ndesigned, and had always been equal to himself; a thing he could not\r\ncommand during a life so chequered and wretched.\r\n\r\nAfter Peruzzi had received the elements of the art in his native place\r\nfrom an unknown master, he went to Rome for the completion of his\r\nstudies, in the time of Alexander VI. He knew, admired, and imitated\r\nRaffaello (of whom some suppose him a pupil), especially his Holy\r\nFamilies.[288] He approached him nearly in some works in fresco; such as\r\nthe Judgment of Paris in the castle of Belcaro, which is deemed his best\r\nperformance, and the celebrated Sybil foretelling the birth of Christ to\r\nAugustus, in the Fonte Giusta, of Siena, which is admired as one of the\r\nfinest pictures in that city. He imparted to it such a divine\r\nenthusiasm, that Raffaello himself never surpassed him in treating this\r\nsubject; nor Guido, nor Guercino, of whom so many Sybils are exhibited.\r\nIn great compositions, such as the Presentation in the Pace at\r\nRome,[289] he designs well, gives a faithful representation of the\r\npassions, and embellishes the subject by appropriate edifices. His oil\r\npaintings are very rare; those representing the Magi, which are shewn in\r\nmany collections at Florence, Parma, and Bologna, are copies from one of\r\nhis chiaroscuros, which was afterwards coloured by Girolamo da Trevigi,\r\nas we are informed by Vasari. I was told at Bologna, that the picture of\r\nGirolamo was lost at sea, and that the picture which the Rizzardi family\r\nof that place possess, is a copy by Cesi. His small altar-pieces are\r\nuncommonly scarce likewise: and I am unable to point out any of them but\r\none, which contains three half-length figures of the Virgin, the\r\nBaptist, and S. Jerome, and is at Torre Babbiana, eighteen miles from\r\nSiena.\r\n\r\nWhat I have here related would have added to the glory of any other\r\nartist; but is little to the merit of Baldassare. The genius of this man\r\nwas not limited to the production of excellent cabinet pictures and\r\nfrescos. I have already said he was an architect; or, as Lomazzo has\r\nexpressed it, a universal architect: and in this profession, the fruit\r\nof his assiduous study of ancient edifices, he ranks among the foremost,\r\nand is even preferred to Bramante. The encomiums bestowed on him by the\r\nmost celebrated writers on architecture are mentioned in the third\r\nvolume of the Sienese Letters.[290] No one, however, has done him\r\ngreater honour than his scholar Serlio, who declares in the introduction\r\nto his fourth book, that, whatever merit his work possesses, is not due\r\nto himself, but to Baldassare da Siena, of whose manuscripts he became\r\nthe heir, and the plagiarist, if we are to credit Giulio\r\nPiccolomini,[291] and his other townsmen. The declaration above stated\r\nabsolves Serlio from this imputation, unless it is insisted that he\r\nought to have affixed the name of Baldassare to every anecdote that he\r\nlearnt or took from those manuscripts; a thing which it would be\r\nunreasonable to demand. He has, indeed, frequently mentioned him, and\r\ncommended him for a sound taste, for facility, and elegance, both in\r\ndesigning edifices, and in ornamenting them. To say the truth, his\r\npeculiar merit lies in giving a pleasing effect to his works; and I have\r\nnot observed any idea of his which in some way does not exhibit the\r\nstamp of a lively imagination. This character is apparent in the portico\r\nof the Massimi at Rome, the great altar of the metropolitan church of\r\nSiena, and the large gateway of the Sacrati palace at Ferrara, which is\r\nso finely ornamented that it is named among the rarities of that city,\r\nand, in its kind, even of Italy. But what chiefly establishes his\r\nreputation as a man of excellent and various genius, is the Farnese\r\npalace, which is \"executed with such exquisite grace that it appears\r\ncreated by enchantment, rather than built by human hands.\"[292]\r\n\r\nHe was eminently skilled in ornamenting facades; in painting so as to\r\nrepresent real architecture, and basso-relievos of sacrifices,\r\nBacchanalian scenes, and battles, which \"serve to maintain the buildings\r\nsound and in good order, while they improve their appearance,\" according\r\nto Serlio.[293] He left fine specimens of this art at Siena and in Rome,\r\nwhere he was followed by Polidoro, who carried it to the summit of\r\nperfection. Peruzzi practised it at the Farnese palace in those pictures\r\nin green earth, with which he covered the outside, and still more in the\r\ninternal decorations. Not to mention F. Sebastiano, Raffaello himself\r\nwas employed in the same place: and in one apartment, finished without\r\nassistance, the celebrated Galatea. Baldassare painted the ceiling and\r\nthe corbels with some fables of Perseus, and other heroes: the style is\r\nlight, spirited, and resembles that of Raffaello, but is unequal to that\r\nof his model. Though inferior in figures he was not behind in some other\r\nbranches. His imitation of stucco ornaments appears so relieved that\r\neven Titian was deceived by it, and found it necessary to change his\r\npoint of view before he could be convinced of his error. A similar\r\nocular deception is produced by the hall where a colonnade is\r\nrepresented, the intercolumniations of which make it appear much larger\r\nthan it really is. This work induced Pietro Aretino to say, that the\r\npalace \"contained no picture more perfect in its kind.\"[294] And if the\r\nscenes which he painted for the plays, represented in the Apostolical\r\npalace for the amusement of Leo X. had survived to our days, the\r\nperspective paintings of Peruzzi would have obtained greater fame than\r\nthe Calandra of Card. da Bibbiena; and it would have been said of him,\r\nas of the ancient, that he discovered a new art, and brought it to\r\nperfection. The observation of Vasari, Lomazzo, and other old writers,\r\nthat Peruzzi was not to be surpassed in perspective, has been recently\r\nconfirmed by Sig. Milizia in the Memoirs of Architects. In this art he\r\nappears to me to have given the first and most classic examples. When I\r\nhave occasion hereafter to notice celebrated perspectives in Rome, in\r\nVenice, or Bologna, we must recollect, that if others surpassed him in\r\nthe vastness of their works, they never did so in their perfection.\r\nMaestro Riccio is praised in Siena as second to him in perspective, and\r\nwas his scholar for some time; but afterwards he imitated the figures of\r\nhis father-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe merit of Baldassare in grotesque is better seen at Siena than in\r\nRome. This sort of painting, always the offspring of a whimsical fancy,\r\nwas congenial to Mecherino and to Razzi; and both practised it with\r\nsuccess. The latter seemed born to conceive and to execute it with\r\nunpremeditated facility; he painted in this style in the Vatican, and\r\nobtained the approbation of Raffaello, who was unwilling to cancel his\r\ngrotesques as he did his historical compositions: he also executed some\r\nat Monte Oliveto that are highly facetious, and may be called an image\r\nof his own brain. Cristoforo Rustici and Giorgio da Siena obtained great\r\nfame in this style; but none of them equalled Peruzzi. This artist,\r\ngraceful in all his works, was most elegant in grotesque; and amid the\r\nfreedom that a subject wholly capricious inspires, he preserved an art\r\nwhich Lomazzo has studied, in order to comprehend its principles. He\r\nemploys every species of idea; satyrs, masks, children, animals,\r\nmonsters, edifices, trees, flowers, vases, candelabra, lamps, armour,\r\nand thunderbolts; but in their arrangement, in the actions represented,\r\nand in every other circumstance, he bridled his caprice by his judgment.\r\nHe distorts and connects those images with a surprising symmetry, and\r\nadapts them as devices emblematic of the stories which they surround.\r\nThis man, living in the brightest period of modern art, is in short, one\r\nof the individuals most interesting in its history. He had many pupils\r\nin architecture, but few in painting: among the latter are a Francesco\r\nSenese, and a Virgilio Romano, who are commended by Vasari for their\r\nfrescos, and to whom grotesques, of uncertain origin, are sometimes\r\nattributed in Siena.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later, but certainly before the complete revival of the art at\r\nSiena, I am disposed to class a fresco painter, whom Baglione and Titi\r\ncall Matteo da Siena; but who is named Matteino in his native place,\r\nthat he may not be confounded with the Matteo of the fourteenth century.\r\nHe lived at Rome in the time of Niccolo Circignani, in whose pictures,\r\nand in those of artists of the same class, he inserted perspectives and\r\nlandscapes. The efforts of his pencil may be seen at S. Stefano Rotondo,\r\nin thirty-two historical pictures of martyrs painted by Circignani,\r\nwhich have been engraved by Cavalieri. Many of his landscapes are in the\r\nVatican gallery, which are beautiful, although in the old style. At the\r\nage of fifty-five he died at Rome, where he was established in the\r\npontificate of Sixtus V. These circumstances make it appear to me\r\nunlikely, that he had painted in the Casino of Siena, about 1551, or in\r\nthe Lucarini palace, along with Rustichino: the first period I consider\r\ntoo early, and the latter too late.\r\n\r\nI shall now give some account of the chiaroscuros executed in mosaic,\r\nwhich owe their perfection to the school of Siena, during the epoch of\r\nwhich we are about to finish our account. I have already mentioned the\r\nerection of the magnificent cathedral of Siena, a work of many years;\r\nand may now add, that though it was grand in all its parts, nothing\r\nshewed such originality, or was so generally admired as the pavement\r\naround the great altar, all storied with subjects taken from the New\r\nTestament, of which the figures were surrounded by appropriate\r\nornaments, which served to vary and divide the immense ground of the\r\npainting. A succession of artists always labouring to improve this work,\r\ncarried it in a few years to an astonishing pitch of excellence. The\r\nnature of the stone quarries in the Sienese territory, afforded also\r\nfacilities to the art which could not be so easily attained in other\r\nplaces. It originated like other arts from small and rude beginnings.\r\nDuccio commenced this ornamented pavement. The part which he executed is\r\nconstructed of stones, in which the limbs and contours of the figures\r\nare scooped out: it is a dry but not ungraceful production of the\r\nthirteenth century. The young woman in the choir who kneels with her\r\narms leaning on a cross, and, as an inscription informs us, implores the\r\nmercy of the Lord, is the work of Duccio: it probably represents\r\nChristian piety; and certainly both the attitude and the countenance are\r\nexpressive of what she asks. Those who continued the pavement\r\nimmediately after Duccio, are not so well known. We read of an Urbano da\r\nCortona, and an Antonio Federighi, who designed and executed the two\r\nSybils; the rest was in like manner the work of artists of little note.\r\nThey all, however, improved the art in some degree, cutting the figures\r\nwith the chisel, and filling up what was removed by the iron, with pitch\r\nor some black composition; and this was a rude sort of chiaroscuro. To\r\nthem succeeded Matteo di Giovanni, who, from an attentive consideration\r\nof what his predecessors had done, fell on a method of surpassing them.\r\nHe remarked a vein of the marble in the drapery of a figure of David,\r\nwhich formed a very natural fold, and by the contrast of the colours\r\nmade the knee and leg appear in relief: in like manner he discovered in\r\na figure of Solomon a shade of colour in the marble, well suited to\r\nproduce effect. He then selected marbles of different colours; and\r\njoining them after the manner of an inlaying with stained wood, produced\r\na work that was entitled to the name of a marble chiaroscuro. In this\r\nmanner he executed without assistance a Slaughter of the Innocents, a\r\ncomposition which he frequently repeated, as we before remarked. He thus\r\nopened the path for Beccafumi's histories, who wrought in a superior\r\nstyle a large part of that pavement, which his exertions, says Vasari,\r\nrendered \"the most beautiful, the largest, and most magnificent that was\r\never executed.\" This work employed his leisure hours till he attained to\r\nold age; and though painting interrupted his labours, he did not abandon\r\nit until his death, and hence, some of the historical compositions were\r\ncompleted by other hands, as is supposed from his cartoons. He executed\r\nthe Sacrifice of Isaac, in figures as large as life; and Moses striking\r\nthe Rock, with a crowd of Hebrews rushing to catch the water, and slake\r\ntheir thirst; besides several other subjects, which are described by\r\nVasari; and more minutely by Landi.[295] I shall subjoin a few\r\nobservations on the mechanism of the art. The first attempt of Beccafumi\r\nwas to compose a picture of inlaid wood, which was long preserved in the\r\nstudio of Vanni, and afterwards was in the possession of the Counts of\r\nthe Delci family. He represented the Conversion of S. Paul in this\r\npiece, by employing wood of the colours only that were necessary to\r\nproduce a chiaroscuro. After this model he selected white marble for the\r\nlight parts of his figures, and the very purest for the catching lights;\r\ngrey marble for the middle tints, black for the shadows, and for the\r\ndarkest lines he sometimes employed a black stucco. He cut the pieces of\r\nthese marbles, which are all indigenous, and inlaid them so nicely that\r\nthe joinings are not easily discernible. This has induced some to\r\nbelieve that white marble is alone employed in this pavement, and that\r\nthe middle tints and shadows are formed by certain very penetrating\r\ncolours, capable of softening the marble and of colouring it throughout.\r\nWe learn from a letter of Gallaccini, that this idea was adopted by some\r\nnatives of Siena, and it appears from another of Mariette, that this\r\ngreat connoisseur was impressed with it, and gained over Bottari to his\r\nopinion.[296] Inspection overturns this supposition, for we may discover\r\nthe seams between the different colours; and this circumstance induces\r\nthe author of the Sienese Letters and the best informed persons, to\r\ndisbelieve the artificial colouring of the marble. The truth is, the\r\nsecret of colouring marble was not then known, but was afterwards\r\ndiscovered in Siena by Michelangiolo Vanni, who has transmitted the\r\nmemory of his invention to posterity.[297] He erected a monument for his\r\nfather, Cav. Francesco, with columns, ornaments, festoons, and figures\r\nof children; accompanied by a genealogy of the family, which were all\r\ndesigned on a white slab, and every part carefully and appropriately\r\ncoloured, so as to resemble mosaic of different marbles. It is supposed\r\nthat the colours were imparted to the marble by some mineral essences to\r\nimpregnate it, because they penetrated a considerable way. He entitles\r\nhimself the inventor of this art, in the monumental inscription. A\r\nsecret of this nature was known to Niccolo Tornioli, of Siena, about the\r\nyear 1640; and this artist is said to have painted a Veronica in that\r\nmanner, the marble of which he caused to be sawed, and the same picture\r\nwas found on each side of the section.[298] He was probably a scholar of\r\nVanni; and the latter seems anxious by the inscription that he should\r\nnot claim the honour of the invention. The connexion of the subject has\r\nled me to notice these two artists in this place. Their true place is in\r\nthe third epoch of the Sienese school, to which I shall immediately\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: Baldinucci, in his Life of Antonio Veneziano, contends\r\nthat this artist resided, during some time, at Siena; but the silence of\r\nthe city historians as to such a fact, leads us to doubt the truth of\r\nhis assertion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Vasari calls him \"a pretty good master\" in the Life of D.\r\nBartolommeo: from the note of Bottari on this passage we collect that he\r\nflourished about 1500. Gigli makes him the master of Beccafumi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: There is a Coronation of the Virgin by him at Fonte\r\nGiusta, and a picture, representing various saints, at Carmine, dated\r\n1512.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: See _Lett. Sanesi_, tom. iii. p. 320, where the\r\ninscription of Signorelli on his pictures in the Petrucci palace is\r\nquoted, and Vasari is corrected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: He is thus named by Baldinucci; but Vasari, in his Life\r\nof Razzi, mentions a Girolamo del Pacchia, a rival of Razzi himself; and\r\nthis person appears to be Pacchiarotto. He also mentions Giomo, or\r\nGirolamo del Sodoma, who died young; and whom both Orlandi and Bottari\r\nhave confounded with Pacchiarotto; when we ought rather to believe that\r\nhe was a pupil of Razzi, and died while he was yet young.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: Mattaccio signifies a buffoon.

If we search into the history of that\r\nhalf century, we shall find that all Italy groaned under the pressure of\r\npublic calamities; but Siena, to a greater degree, and for a longer\r\nperiod than any other place, endured an accumulation of the most\r\nterrible evils. Famine, pestilence, and a suspension of commercial\r\nintercourse, afflicted other states, but here they seem to have\r\nexhausted their rage: civil commotions and external enemies agitated\r\nother states, but here, during a period of many years, they allowed not\r\na moment of tranquillity. The republic of Siena, strong in the valour of\r\nher citizens, was feeble in every thing besides; and hence it resembled\r\na gulph, where tempests are more frequent and more violent than on the\r\nocean. The usurpation of the Petrucci, the dissensions between the\r\nnobles and the people, and jealousy of foreign powers, who sought her\r\nsubjugation, kept Siena in constant alarm, and often incited to arms and\r\nto bloodshed. The remedy which they now expected in the protection of\r\nthe emperor, at another time from France, only served to aggravate\r\ninternal commotion and foreign aggression. Amid this perpetual\r\nagitation, I know not whether most to admire the genius of the people,\r\never directed to the decoration of their houses and public edifices, or\r\nthe spirit of the artists, who could summon all the powers of their\r\nminds to such efforts: this I know, that similar instances are rare in\r\nother countries. The year 1555 at length arrived, when Cosmo I. deprived\r\nthe Sienese of their long defended liberty. To any enemy but the\r\nFlorentines they would have submitted with less reluctance; and on this\r\naccount our astonishment is lessened on finding that, on this occasion,\r\ntwo thirds of the inhabitants abandoned their native soil, refusing to\r\nlive subject to enemies so abhorred.\r\n\r\nAt this time, and in the disasters above alluded to, the city lost many\r\nable artists, and also several families, from whom eminent artists were\r\ndescended, and whose Sienese origin is confirmed by history. Baglione\r\nsays of Camillo Mariani, that he was born at Vicenza, and that his\r\nfather was a native of Siena, who had expatriated himself on account of\r\nthe wars; and he praises the cabinet pictures of this artist, who died\r\nat Rome with the reputation of an excellent sculptor. I likewise find at\r\nBologna an Agostino Marcucci, of Siena, who is wholly unknown in that\r\nplace, probably because he was the son of an emigrant. He was a disciple\r\nof the Caracci, till a schism arose in that school, which we shall\r\nnotice in its proper place, when he ranged himself with the foremost\r\nadherents of Facini, the leader of the party, and they had the boldness\r\nto set up a new academy in opposition to that of the Caracci. He\r\ncontinued to reside in Bologna, and to teach to the time of his death,\r\nand is reckoned by Malvasia among \"the first men\" of that age. Of his\r\nscholars Malvasia mentions only Ruggieri, and he only notices one of his\r\npictures at the Concezione;[299] to which several others, however, are\r\nadded in the New Guide.\r\n\r\nSiena, in the mean time, began to breathe from her misfortunes, and to\r\nbe reconciled to the new government, which, through the prudence of\r\nCosmo, appeared rather a reformation in the old, than a new domination.\r\nNo long time elapsed before the void left in the city by the artists who\r\nhad emigrated was filled up by others. Rustico had remained there, as\r\nwell as his superior, Riccio, who painted the celebrated scene, already\r\nnoticed, on the coming of Cosmo. Siena also possessed Tozzo and Bigio,\r\nwhom Lancillotti reckons \"among the most famous painters,\" I believe, in\r\nsmall figures; and it is not easy to distinguish between those two\r\nartists, who had an extraordinary similarity of style. Arcangiolo\r\nSalimbeni, who is expressly said by Baldinucci to be a \"scholar of\r\nFederigo Zuccari,\" may have received the rudiments of the art from one\r\nof them. Perhaps, as the historian goes on to say, during his residence\r\nat Rome he might contract an intimate friendship with Zuccari; but the\r\nstyle of Salimbeni discovers very opposite principles from those of that\r\nmaster; and notwithstanding all researches, no one has succeeded in\r\nfinding pictures of his that bear indications of that school. He loved\r\nprecision more than fulness of design; and we may even observe in him an\r\nattachment to the manner of Pietro Perugino, as was observed by Della\r\nValle with regard to a Crucifixion attended by six Saints, in the parish\r\nchurch of Lusignano. In his other pictures at Siena, especially in the\r\nS. Peter-Martyr, in possession of the Dominicans, he appears wholly\r\nmodern;[300] but diligent, and free from the defects which we often\r\nobserve in Federigo, who may be considered as a professed mannerist of\r\nthat period. It was the good fortune of the Sienese school, that Riccio\r\nwas succeeded by this artist, who, if he had not a lofty genius,\r\npossessed, at least, the judgment to avoid the faults of his\r\ncontemporaries. Hence, amid the degeneracy of the neighbouring schools\r\nthis remained uncontaminated, or but slightly infected; and the new\r\ndisciples it sent forth contributed to the improvement of the art in\r\nItaly. They were not so much attached to home as Mecherino; they painted\r\nequally well beyond the territory of Siena; they visited very distant\r\ncities, and in them all left specimens of their art, both in public and\r\nin private, which are still preserved. After receiving the first\r\ninstruction from Salimbeni, or some less known artist, each chose his\r\nown guide. We shall here proceed with their history.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the rudiments of the art at Siena, Pietro Sorri went to\r\nFlorence, under Passignano, and became his son-in-law, and the associate\r\nof his labours in that place and in Venice. He emulated the style of\r\nPassignano, which partook, as we have observed, of the Florentine and\r\nthe Venetian: he succeeded so well, that their works bear a perfect\r\nresemblance, and are held in equal estimation. He painted less\r\nexpeditiously than his father-in-law; but his colouring was more\r\ndurable, and, if I mistake not, his design more graceful. The convent of\r\nS. Sebastian, which was ornamented by a competition of the best Sienese\r\nartists of this epoch, has one of his pictures, which are rather\r\nuncommon in Siena; for his best years were spent in other places. He was\r\nmuch at Florence: and afterwards visited many other Tuscan cities; and\r\nthere is scarcely any considerable place among them which cannot boast\r\nthe efforts of his easy and graceful pencil; but particularly Pisa, the\r\ncathedral of which could not but attract such an artist. He there\r\nrepresented the Consecration of that church on one large canvas, and, on\r\nanother, Christ disputing with the Doctors, which is inscribed with his\r\nname: and never did he approach nearer to the excellence of Paul\r\nVeronese in architecture and other accompaniments. He was employed in\r\nthe Carthusian monastery of Pavia, and also in Genoa, where we shall\r\nfind him as a preceptor in that school.\r\n\r\nCasolani took his surname from Casole, the little town from which his\r\nfamily removed to Siena. In the ducal gallery of Florence there is a\r\nportrait of a lady with three men, in the same piece, which is said to\r\nrepresent Lucrezia Piccolomini, with her three sons, Alessandro\r\nCasolani, Francesco Vanni, and Ventura Salimbeni, whom she bore to\r\ndifferent husbands, in the course of a few years. This makes Alessandro\r\nthe stepson of Arcangiolo Salimbeni, and the uterine brother of Ventura\r\nand of Vanni. I cannot find this story in any author, except in Niccolo\r\nPio, a Roman writer of no authority, whose manuscript, containing\r\nnotices of two hundred and fifty artists, which was drawn up about 1724,\r\nis preserved in the Vatican library.[301] The old writers of Siena have\r\ntaken no notice of so remarkable an event, and we cannot, therefore,\r\ngive credit to Pio, a stranger, and a modern author. The relation then\r\nin which Alessandro stands to Arcangiolo is that of scholar; but he\r\nlearnt more from Cav. Roncalli in Siena and in Rome. He remained long in\r\nthe latter city: he designed the finest works it contained, and obtained\r\nsome idea of different styles. This knowledge was increased by a journey\r\nwhich he made some years afterwards to Pavia, where he painted in the\r\nCarthusian monastery, and in other places. His manner is prodigiously\r\nvaried. It exhibits traces of the best style of Roncalli, a good design,\r\nsobriety of composition, a modesty of colouring, and tranquil harmony.\r\nHe seems also to have aimed at originality, for he was continually\r\naltering his style, mingling it with the graces of various artists, and\r\nsometimes striking out into a novel path. He possessed promptness of\r\ngenius and of execution: he was quick in committing his ideas to the\r\ncanvas; and when dissatisfied with his work, he often chose to cancel\r\nthe whole, rather than to correct a part. Although unacquainted with\r\nideal beauty, he was esteemed by Guido, who may be considered as the\r\nfather of modern painters, and who said of him \"this truly is a\r\npainter.\" Whoever would see his best work, may examine the martyrdom of\r\nS. Bartholomew, at the Carmine of Siena. It is a picture of considerable\r\nsize, with great variety in the figures and in the expression, and\r\naltogether excites surprise. We are told that when Roncalli examined it,\r\nhe at length exclaimed, that the art of that period was comprised in\r\nthat picture. But the short life of Casolani prevented him attaining the\r\nexcellence which this specimen promised. His works are in various cities\r\nof Tuscany, and also in Naples, Genoa, and Fermo, in the metropolitan\r\nchurch of which there is a picture of S. Louis of France, that is\r\nnumbered among the choice paintings in that city.\r\n\r\nA good many of his works in Siena shew traces of, and even whole figures\r\nby other hands; having been finished by Vanni, and Ventura Salimbeni, or\r\nby other artists, either of his own or of different schools. Ilario\r\nCasolani, his son, by a daughter of Rustici, finished the Assumption for\r\nthe Church of S. Francis; and afterwards went to Rome, where he was\r\n\"noticed by Cav. Pomaranci, out of respect to his father,\" says Mancini,\r\nas of a thing he knew, and adds, that Pomaranci had good hopes of him.\r\nBaglione and Pio called him Cristoforo, a name he, perhaps, received\r\nalong with several others at baptism; and which probably the Sienese\r\nartist thought more becoming at Rome than Ilario, since he is named\r\nCristoforo, by Roncalli. Under Pomaranci he became a proficient in his\r\nstyle in fresco, and imitated it particularly at Madonna de' Monti, in\r\nsome pictures from the history of the Virgin, and in an Ascension on the\r\nceiling; the best work, perhaps, produced in the short course of his\r\nlife. Titi uniformly names him Cristoforo Consolano; but a consideration\r\nof the anecdotes of Mancini and Baglione leads us to convert it into\r\nCasolano. A Resurrection of Lazarus, begun by Alessandro for the church\r\nof S. Francis, was finished by Vincenzio Rustici; who was probably his\r\nscholar and his kinsman, and who is the least celebrated among this\r\nfamily of painters. One of his pictures, intended for Santuccio, was\r\nfinished by Sebastiano Folli. The frescos of this artist are more\r\nnumerous at Siena than his oil pictures: the ornamental parts of them\r\nare superior to his figures, in which he inclined to mannerism; his\r\ncompartments are beautiful, his architecture finely conducted, his\r\nimitations of stucco deceive the eye, and he was expert in\r\nforeshortening what was to be seen from below. In 1608 he painted the\r\nfrescos of S. Sebastian, in competition with various artists, and in\r\nthis trial of skill he only yields to Rutilio Manetti. In the Guide of\r\nthe Cav. Pecci I find mention made of designs of Casolani, executed in\r\nfresco by Stefano Volpi, whose name not unfrequently occurs in that\r\nwork, and who was probably a scholar of that excellent artist.\r\n\r\nCav. Ventura, the son of A. Salimbeni, is reckoned the third scholar of\r\nthat master, though his lessons from Arcangiolo must have been but few.\r\nThe young man left his home early, and journeying through the cities of\r\nLombardy, he studied the works of Correggio and others, whose taste\r\nbegan to be applauded in Tuscany. He went to Rome in the pontificate of\r\nSixtus V. and raised a very favourable opinion of his genius, which,\r\ngiving himself up to dissipation, he did not afterwards fulfil. In that\r\ncity he left many frescos that are praised by Baglione, among which, the\r\nAbraham entertaining the Angels, in a chapel of the Gesu, appears, on\r\nthe whole, the work of a consummate painter. It has something lively and\r\ngraceful in the colouring and the countenances, which he always\r\nretained: it also shews attention to design and chiaroscuro, which, in a\r\ngreat measure, he afterwards neglected in his paintings. In conjunction\r\nwith Vanni he executed some ceilings, and, perhaps, derived advantage\r\nfrom observing this painter, though his junior by eight years. In many\r\nof his works he undoubtedly resembles him in his imitation of Baroccio,\r\nand hardly yields to him in grace of contour, in expression, and in\r\ndelicacy and clearness of colouring. He is admired in the church of S.\r\nQuirico, and in that of S. Domenick: in the one is his Appearance of the\r\nAngel at the Sepulchre; in the other a Crucifixion, with various Saints\r\naround, which are superior to the generality of his works. In several\r\nother places in Siena there are others of great merit, especially where\r\nhe painted in the vicinity of the works of the best masters of his\r\nschool. He likewise executed some beautiful historical pieces when he\r\nvied with Poccetti, in the cloister of the Servi at Florence, and in the\r\ncathedral of Pisa, where he was surrounded by such great painters. His\r\nMarriage of the Virgin, in the cathedral of Foligno, his S. Gregory, in\r\nthe church of S. Peter at Perugia, his works in Lucca, in Pavia, and in\r\nvarious cities of Italy, justify the remark of Baglione, that Salimbeni\r\nwas impatient of remaining long in any one place. In Genoa, however, his\r\nstay was not so short. The beautiful chamber in the Adorno palace, and\r\nother works which he there executed, are still in existence, while many\r\nothers have perished. He went to Genoa at the same time with Agostino\r\nTassi, who served him for an ornamental and landscape painter, and,\r\nperhaps, it was through him that Ottavio Ghissoni, of Siena, came to\r\nthat place; an artist, if I am not mistaken, forgotten in the annals of\r\nhis own country; in fresco he was more lively than correct. He studied\r\nat Rome under Cherubino Alberti; but his country, his style, and the\r\ntime of his arrival at Genoa, afford ground to suspect that he had also\r\nreceived the lessons of Salimbeni. Soprani gives Ventura the surname of\r\nBevilacqua, which is rather an addition to his name granted him by\r\nCardinal Bevilacqua when he knighted him in Perugia.\r\n\r\nCav. Francesco Vanni, in the opinion of many, is the best painter of\r\nthis school; and is reckoned one of the restorers of Italian painting in\r\nthe sixteenth century. The early instruction of his genius is to be\r\nassigned with greater probability to his brother than to his\r\nstepfather. At sixteen years of age he went to Rome, for the purpose of\r\ndesigning after Raffaello and the best masters. He was for some time\r\nunder the tuition of Gio. de' Vecchi, whose style he introduced into his\r\nnative country. There are specimens of him in many churches, and it is\r\nrelated that they were not relished by his fellow citizens; a\r\ncircumstance which might occasion him uneasiness at the time, but soon\r\nafter afforded him a lasting source of satisfaction. It induced him to\r\nexamine the pictures of Lombardy, as his brother had done: and having\r\nremained in Parma to design some of them, he afterwards went to Bologna,\r\nwhere he was assiduously occupied. Ugurgieri writes that he was at that\r\nplace in 1667, at which time he was twelve years old: this I believe to\r\nbe incorrect; for it was unknown to Mancini, who was acquainted with\r\nVanni. Malvasia repeats it on the authority of Ugurgieri; but he can\r\ndiscover nothing further of Vanni, at Bologna, than his being there\r\nafter he had arrived at manhood, and designing in the academy of Facini\r\nand Mirandola, to which he was probably introduced by his countryman\r\nMarcucci. He left some works at Bologna, in the style of the Caracci, if\r\nhe is the painter of a Madonna, which was shewn me as a Vanni, in a\r\ncabinet of the Zambeccari collection. His Flight into Egypt, painted for\r\nthe church of S. Quirico, in Siena, bears also undoubted marks of the\r\nBolognese school.\r\n\r\nAlthough he attempted other styles, he was not like Casolani an adherent\r\nto none. Vanni attached himself to the elegant and florid manner of\r\nBarocci, in which he was eminently successful. Of this, the Humiliation\r\nof Simon the Sorcerer, which he painted on a stone slab for the church\r\nof S. Peter at Rome, affords a proof; a picture which, though recently\r\ncleaned with little judgment, is still an object of admiration. Both the\r\ndesign and colouring are in the manner of Barocci; and it is prepared\r\nwith a due regard to the humidity of that church; nor has it been found\r\nnecessary to remove it, as has happened to other pictures. He also\r\npainted in Siena, and in other Italian cities, where he has approached\r\nthe manner of Barocci more closely than Viviani, or any other pupil of\r\nthat artist. His Marriage of S. Catherine, with a numerous group of\r\nangels, at the Refugio, is much praised in Siena: as is the Madonna,\r\nsurrounded by saints, painted for the church of Monna Agnese; and the S.\r\nRaymond walking on the Sea, in the possession of the Domenican Fathers,\r\nwhich is supposed by some to be his best picture in Siena, where his\r\nworks are very numerous. Among the finest pictures in the cathedral of\r\nPisa, is the Dispute about the Sacrament, painted in emulation of his\r\nbrother Ventura, who had surpassed his usual style in the altar-piece of\r\nthe angels. At the Umilta of Pistoia, in the convent of the Camaldules\r\nof Fabriano, and in that of the Capuchins of S. Quirico, are some of his\r\nmost exquisite works; and they are so numerous in other places, that I\r\ndo not imagine a full catalogue of them has ever been made out. He is\r\ngenerally a follower of Barocci, as we have observed; and amateurs,\r\ndeceived principally by his colouring, and the heads of his boys, which\r\nappear cast in the mould of Barocci, frequently confound the latter with\r\nVanni: but one, well acquainted with Federigo, observes in him more\r\ngrandeur of design, and greater freedom in the touches of the pencil.\r\nThe pictures which Vanni executed negligently, or at low prices (of\r\nwhich there are several at Siena), can hardly be recognized as his.\r\n\r\nBy the example and lessons of Vanni, the honour of painting was long\r\nsupported at Siena. He taught many pupils, who did not, however, rigidly\r\nadopt his style; but, as is usually the case, imitated the master most\r\nrecently in vogue, or, in other words, followed the fashion of the time.\r\nWe shall begin with his two sons, to whom he had given the names most\r\ncelebrated in the art. Michelangiolo, the eldest, we have mentioned with\r\napplause, as the inventor of staining marble: but he did not attain much\r\ncelebrity except in this art. I know not whether he ever was out of\r\nSiena, and there we find few of his paintings, except a S. Catherine in\r\nthe act of praying with the Redeemer, which was painted for the\r\nOlivetine monks. Raffaele, the second, left an orphan at the age of\r\nthirteen, was recommended to Antonio Caracci, and in that school,\r\naccording to Mancini, made such progress as even to surpass his father;\r\nbut this is not the opinion of posterity. All allow that he possessed\r\ngrandeur of design, and a fine taste in shadows and in colouring, with\r\nsome resemblance to Cortona, who, in his day, drew after him even his\r\ncontemporaries. The birth of the Virgin Mary, in the Pace at Rome, and\r\nseveral of his other pictures, have no small portion of the ideas and\r\ncontrasts of the followers of Cortona. He lived long in Rome, and on\r\nthat account is frequently mentioned by Titi. Tuscany is not deficient\r\nin his works. At the church of S. Catherine, at Pisa, there is a picture\r\nof the titular Saint; Florence possesses the pictures of the Riccardi\r\nsaloon; and at the church of S. George, in Siena, is his Procession of\r\nour Saviour to Calvary. These are esteemed among his finest productions;\r\nand the last is characterized as his masterpiece. Both brothers had the\r\nhonour of knighthood; but it was more worthily bestowed on the second\r\nthan on the first.\r\n\r\nContemporary with the Cav. Raffaello, as well as his assistant at S.\r\nMaria della Pace at Rome, and in several places at Siena, we find the\r\nname of Bernardino Mei. I am unacquainted with that of his master; and\r\nP. della Valle, who saw several of his works, sometimes compares him to\r\nthe Caracci, at others to Paul Veronese, and to Guercino, much as the\r\neclectic philosophers adopt or change the maxims of the different\r\nschools. He commends him for the airs of his heads, and, as one of his\r\nbest productions, alludes to a fresco in the Casa Bandinelli, with an\r\nAurora in a ceiling, and with several other elegant figures and designs.\r\n\r\nFrancesco di Cristofano Rustici, called Rustichino, is better known in\r\nSiena than those just mentioned. He obtained the name of Rustichino,\r\neither because he was the last of a family that had produced three\r\npainters before him, or because he died in the outset of life. This\r\ncircumstance, perhaps, has contributed to his reputation. All his\r\nremaining works are beautiful, which seldom happens to artists who live\r\nto a great age, and who abate in diligence as they advance in reputation\r\nand in years. He is a graceful follower of Caravaggio; and particularly\r\nexcels in confined or candle lights, much in the style of Gherardo della\r\nNotte; but he is perhaps more select. The Dying Magdalen, in possession\r\nof the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the S. Sebastian, cured by S. Irene,\r\nwhich belongs to Prince Borghese, in Rome, are in this style. But it was\r\nnot the only one in which Rustichino painted. He had visited Rome, and\r\nhad studied the works of the Caracci and of Guido, of which traces may\r\nbe discovered in several of his works; but, at the same time, all of\r\nthem possess a certain originality, and something peculiarly his own.\r\nThe best of all his pictures at Siena is an Annunciation, in Provenzano,\r\nbefore which the Virgin, S. Catherine, prays, surrounded by a multitude\r\nof angels. If Rustichino pleases in other works, in this he enchants us.\r\nHe began a work on the history of the city in the public palace, in\r\nwhich his father, whose figures were not equal to his decorations, was\r\nalso employed, and it was finished by other artists.\r\n\r\nRutilio Manetti, or, as Pecci writes it, Mannetti, followed Caravaggio\r\nwith less discrimination, but with greater force in the shadows. His\r\npictures at Siena are easily recognized by invariably partaking of a\r\ncertain sombre hue, which deranges the due balance and participation of\r\nlight and shade. The same objection lies against many of his\r\ncontemporaries of every school. The method of purifying colours, and of\r\ncomposing vehicles,[302] had degenerated; and the injury sustained from\r\nthis defect was not observed in the pictures: the artist only looked to\r\nthe grand effect, to which the age so much aspired. Manetti united an\r\nimproved design to ideas above the common order, and beautiful\r\narchitecture; and hence, at times, he approaches rather to Guercino than\r\nto Caravaggio. In the cathedral of Siena is his Elijah under the juniper\r\ntree, in which the historian of that church commends the force of the\r\ncolouring, which is juicy and natural. Many of his works remain in the\r\nCarthusian monastery of Florence, and in several churches of Siena, the\r\nmost admired of which is the Repose of the Holy Family, in S. Peter's of\r\nCastelvecchio. In private collections, where pictures are better\r\npreserved than in churches, we find very beautiful Madonnas by this\r\nartist; and there is a most exquisite Lucretia in the possession of the\r\nBandinelli family. He sometimes departed from his usual manner, as in\r\nthe Triumph of David, in the ducal gallery, in which the shadows are not\r\nso dark, and the tone of the whole is more lively. Mention is made in\r\nthe _Lettere Pittoriche_,[303] of Bernardino Capitelli, a scholar of\r\nManetti, and an etcher: and in the third volume there is casual mention\r\nof one Domenico Manetti, probably of the same family, but not to be\r\nmistaken for the great individual of the same name. He appears rather to\r\nhave employed himself in ornamenting private collections, and painted a\r\nBaptism of Constantine for the casa Magnoni, that has been much\r\ncommended.\r\n\r\nAstolfo Petrazzi, as well as Vanni, was a pupil of the younger Salimbeni\r\nand of Sorri; and seems, more than any other, to have adhered to the\r\nmanner of his master. He frequently aims at pleasing the eye, and not\r\nunfrequently chooses his models from the schools of Upper Italy. A\r\nMarriage-feast of Cana, by his hand, in a private house, brings Paolo\r\nstrongly to our recollection. His Communion of S. Jerome, in the\r\npossession of the Augustine friars, partakes, perhaps, too strongly of\r\nthe manner of the Caracci. This picture, which he painted at Rome, was\r\nmuch admired at Siena, and was the origin of his great employment in\r\nthat city, where his pictures are always decorated with most pleasing\r\nchoirs of angels. His cabinet pictures were also lively; witness the\r\nfour Seasons at Volte, a seat of the noble family of Chigi. He kept an\r\nopen academy for painting in his house, which was much frequented by\r\nnatives of Siena, and honoured by the attendance of Borgognone, who\r\nstopt some months with Astolfo before he went to Rome. Hence, many of\r\nthis artist's early battle-pieces and landscapes are to be met with at\r\nSiena: the house of Sig. Decano Giovanelli, a literary ornament of that\r\ncity, abounded with them.\r\n\r\nI find some other painters of this school who are known beyond the state\r\nof Siena. Antiveduto Grammatica, an eminent painter, of Sienese\r\nextraction, was known at Rome, where he was president of the academy of\r\nS. Luke. It is true that he was deprived of that office for attempting\r\nto substitute one of his own copies for a S. Luke, by Raffaello, which\r\nhe had sold to a gentleman. He had a peculiar talent in the art of\r\ncopying, especially heads, and, on this account, he was a good\r\nportrait painter. Although we are not certain that he had any master but\r\none Domenico Perugino, a painter of little wooden scenes,[304] he\r\nobtained applause in large compositions. There is an Annunciation by\r\nGrammatica of a most brilliant colouring, in the hospital of the\r\nIncurables; and several of his other pictures, in different churches. He\r\ndied at Rome in 1626.\r\n\r\nTwo other artists, unknown in their native place, are made known to me\r\nby their signatures. On a Last Supper, in the convent of the Angioli,\r\nbelow Assisi, I discovered _Franciscus Antonius Senensis_, 1614, or\r\nthereabouts. The style has enough of Baroccio to lead me to suspect that\r\nhe was the scholar of Vanni, or of Salimbeni: nor must he be reckoned\r\nthe meanest of that school, for he was master of expression in a degree\r\nsuperior to mediocrity. The figure of the departing Judas is the image\r\nof desperate resolve, and would be much better had he not given it the\r\nfeet of a bat; a grotesque conceit. In the same neighbourhood, at the\r\nchurch of Foligno, I read, beneath a Holy Family, the name of\r\n_Marcantonio Grecchi_, and the date 1634. The style is solid,\r\nexpressive, and correct; more resembling Tiarini di Bologna than any\r\nmaster of Siena. Niccolo Tornioli, lately mentioned, painted in the\r\nchurch of S. Paul, at Bologna, in various cities of Italy: in Siena he\r\nleft, perhaps, no picture in public but the Vocation of S. Matthew,\r\nstill remaining in the custom-house. Towards the close of the century,\r\npainting was practised at Siena chiefly by foreigners. Annibale\r\nMazzuoli, a fresco painter of rapid execution but of little merit, was\r\nmost employed: he afterwards went to Rome, and is the last name inserted\r\nin the Eulogies of Pio.\r\n\r\nPainting, however, came again into repute at Siena, about 1700, when its\r\ncredit was restored by Cav. Giuseppe Nasini, a scholar of Ciro Ferri.\r\nNasini possessed the qualities for which I have commended many of his\r\nnation, a fervid genius, a fertile imagination, and a poetic vein; but\r\nhis poetry was of the species that prevailed in Italy during his younger\r\ndays, a composition unrestrained by fixed rules. To this spirit we not\r\nunfrequently discover some analogy in his paintings, in which we could\r\ndesire to find more order, a more choice design, and colouring less\r\nvulgar. He always shews, however, a taste for allegory, great command of\r\npencil, and an imposing air on the whole; and the observation of Redi,\r\nthat \"he stuns the beholder,\" is not without some foundation.[305] This\r\nremark was made when Nasini had finished the cupola of the chapel of S.\r\nAnthony, in the church of the Apostles at Rome; in which chapel there is\r\na picture by Luti. He afterwards entered into a competition with Luti,\r\nand the first artists then in Rome, in the large prophets of the lateran\r\ncathedral. His masterpiece is supposed to be the S. Leonard, in Madonna\r\ndel Pianto, at Foligno, the ceiling of which he painted with good\r\nfrescos. Siena contains some of his finest productions of every kind;\r\nabove all, the pictures of the Novissimi, intended for the Pitti palace,\r\nbut transferred from it to the church of the Conventuals of Siena. It\r\ncontains a great number of figures neither so select nor so well\r\narranged as to arrest the eye of the spectator; but he who would\r\ncontemptuously overlook it, let him say how many painters then in Italy\r\ncould have produced such a picture.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe brought up two pupils in his house. He had a brother named\r\nAntonio, who was a priest, whose likeness is among the eminent portrait\r\npainters in the gallery at Florence. Cav. Apollonio Nasini, the son of\r\nGiuseppe, was inferior to his father in the profession; yet assisted him\r\nin his greatest works, and held an honourable rank among his\r\ncontemporaries. Gioseffo Pinacci, of Siena, a disciple of Mehus in\r\nfigures, and of Borgognone in battle-pieces, lived in the time of\r\nNasini. He was a good painter of portraits, and made a considerable\r\nfortune, first at the court of Carpio, Viceroy of Naples, and afterwards\r\nin the service of the grand duke Ferdinand, at Florence, where several\r\nof his works remain. But his chief merit consisted in a knowledge of the\r\npencilling of the old masters. Nicolo Franchini distinguished himself\r\nrather by restoring the work of other hands than by his own productions,\r\nand thus furnished Pecci with much convenient information for his City\r\nGuide; \"by his skill,\" says the Cavaliere, \"in restoring injured\r\nspecimens to their original beauty, without applying to them a fresh\r\npencil, and in supplying the faded colours with others taken from\r\npaintings of less value, he entitled himself, in fact, to the praise of\r\na new discovery.\" We shall here conclude the school of Siena; and shall\r\nadd in its praise, that if it did not produce painters of the very\r\nhighest class, it at least boasts many artists, eminent when we consider\r\ntheir era, and few inferior, or not above mediocrity.[306] It indeed\r\nappears, that either a genius for painting is natural to that people, or\r\nthat none of them have embraced the art who were not capable of\r\nprosecuting it successfully.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: See Malvasia, tom. i. p. 571; and tom. ii. p. 355.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: It has his name and the year 1579, which date must be\r\nfalse. The widow of Arcangiolo married again, and bore Francesco Vanni\r\nin 1565. Consequently the latter could not be the scholar of Arcangiolo,\r\nthough such an idea is very prevalent; and he could give lessons only\r\nfor a short time to his son, Ventura, or to Sorri, and Casolani, if the\r\nperiod of their birth is true.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: See letter 127 in vol. v. of _Lett. Pittor._, in which\r\nthere is a catalogue of those painters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: The idea that the brilliant colouring of the Venetian\r\nschool was owing to the use of a peculiar vehicle for the colours, or a\r\ncertain varnish, has been long entertained by artists and connoisseurs;\r\nand the opinion has been sanctioned by great names: yet it is highly\r\nprobable that the great secret of the Venetian painters consisted not in\r\nvehicles nor in varnishes, but in employing mineral colours, and in\r\nlaying them on the canvas as little mixed as possible. No colour derived\r\nfrom the vegetable kingdom will stand well when mixed with oil, and our\r\nbest colours are composed of metallic oxides, or earthy bodies highly\r\ncharged with those oxides. When colours are much mixed on the palette\r\nthey become invariably muddy, and to him who aims at brilliancy of\r\ncolouring no maxim is of greater consequence than _to keep his palette\r\nas clean as possible_. The use of transparent colours in the shadows is\r\nanother great cause of brilliancy, and this cannot be obtained by the\r\nuse of mixed colours. It is produced by what is called glazing, or\r\nlaying transparent colours one over another. In nothing is the effect of\r\nglazing, in giving transparency, more obvious, than in the astonishing\r\nclearness of the skies and water in the works of the best Dutch artists.\r\nThat the magical effect of Kuyp's pictures is thus produced, I had an\r\nopportunity of knowing, from the blunder of a picture-cleaner, who\r\nthought he had made a great discovery when he found the _Rhine_ of a\r\ndeep blue in a picture by this master; from which, along with the\r\nvarnish, he had removed a thin coating of yellow, with which the blue\r\nwas glazed over, to produce the beautiful greenish hue of the water.\r\n(_Note by_ Dr. Traile.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: Tom. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: His name alone survives in Perugia; though it is believed\r\nthat one of his pictures remains in the church of S. Angelo Magno, at\r\nAscoli, where the figure of S. Giovanni is ascribed by Lazzeri, in his\r\n_Ascoli in Prospettiva_, to one Giandomenico da Perugia, and the\r\nlandscape to Gio. Francesco da Bologna, that is to say, to Grimaldi. The\r\nfigure is in the Guercino taste, according to the opinion of Sig.\r\nOrsini; but I cannot conceive how he or the Sig. Mariotti (p. 273)\r\nshould not have remarked that it must be the production of Giandomenico\r\nCerrini, of Perugia, contemporary with Grimaldi and Guercino, and not of\r\nthat Domenico, the painter of wooden scenes, who lived about an age\r\nanterior to them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: Lett. Pittoriche, tom. ii. p. 69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: A few of the names that obtained least celebrity in Siena\r\nare pointed out by P. M. della Valle in the third volume of the Lettere\r\nSenesi, (p. 459,) among which are found Crescienzio Gamberelli\r\nNasinesco, Deifobo Burbarini, a poor artist, Aurelio Martelli, called Il\r\nMutolo, Gio. Batista Ramacciotti, a priest and connoisseur in painting;\r\nand the same may be said of Bernardino Fungai, and of the noble Marcello\r\nLoli, of Galgano Perpignano, with others of like merit, either omitted\r\nor slightly mentioned by Sig. Pecci. P. della Valle excuses himself from\r\nthe task of treating of them in favor of happier writers, but as we do\r\nnot pretend to aspire to that felicity, we shall leave others to avail\r\nthemselves of the Father's liberality.]\r\n\r\n\r\n         END OF VOL.
