To have given it either\r\nof these forms, each of which has its obvious advantages, would have\r\nextended it beyond all reasonable limits. It is simply a selection from\r\nmy very full memoranda of a series of visits paid to different parts of\r\nFrance during the year 1889.\r\n\r\nThese visits would never have been made, had not my previous\r\nacquaintance with France and with French affairs, going back now--such\r\nas it is--to the early days of the Second Empire, given me reasonable\r\nground to hope that I might get some touch of the actual life and\r\nopinions of the people in the places to which I went. My motive for\r\nmaking these visits was the fact that what it has become the fashion to\r\ncall 'parliamentary government,' or, in other words, the unchecked\r\nadministration of the affairs of a great people by the directly elected\r\nrepresentatives of the people, is now formally on its trial in France.\r\nWe do not live under this form of government in the United States, but\r\nas a thoughtless tendency towards this form of government has shown\r\nitself of late years even in the United States and much more strongly in\r\nGreat Britain, I thought it worth while to see it at work and form some\r\nnotion of its results in France.\r\n\r\nRepublican Switzerland has carefully sought to protect herself against\r\nthis form of government. The Swiss Constitution of 1874 reposes\r\nultimately on the ancient autonomy of the Cantons. Each Canton has one\r\nrepresentative in the Federal Executive Council. The members of this\r\nCouncil are elected for three years by the Federal Assembly, and from\r\namong their own number they choose the President of the Confederation,\r\nwho serves for one year only--a provision probably borrowed from the\r\nfirst American Constitution. The Cantonal autonomy was further\r\nstrengthened in 1880 by the establishment of the Federal Tribunal on\r\nlines taken from those of the American Supreme Court. There is a\r\ndivision of the Executive authority between the Federal Assembly and the\r\nFederal Council, which is yet to be tested by the strain of a great\r\nEuropean war, but which has so far developed no serious domestic\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nThe outline map which accompanies this volume will show that my visits,\r\nwhich began with Marseilles and the Bouches-du-Rhône, upon my return\r\nfrom Rome to Paris in January 1889, on the eve of the memorable election\r\nof General Boulanger as a deputy for the Seine in that month, were\r\nextended to Nancy in the east of France, to the frontiers of Belgium and\r\nthe coasts of the English Channel in the north, to Rennes, Nantes, and\r\nBordeaux in the west, and to Toulouse, Nîmes, and Arles in the south. I\r\nwent nowhere without the certainty of meeting persons who could and\r\nwould put me in the way of seeing what I wanted to see, and learning\r\nwhat I wanted to learn. I took with me everywhere the best books I could\r\nfind bearing on the true documentary history of the region I was about\r\nto see, and I concerned myself in making my memoranda not only with the\r\nmore or less fugitive aspects of public action and emotion at the\r\npresent time, but with the past, which has so largely coloured and\r\ndetermined these fugitive aspects. Naturally, therefore, when I sat down\r\nto put this volume into shape, I very soon found it to be utterly out of\r\nthe question for me to try to do justice to all that had interested and\r\ninstructed me in every part of France which I had visited.\r\n\r\nI have contented myself accordingly with formulating, in this\r\nIntroduction, my general convictions as to the present condition and\r\noutlook of affairs in France and as to the relation which actually\r\nexists between the Third Republic, now installed in power at Paris, and\r\nthe great historic France of the French people; and with submitting to\r\nmy readers, in support of these convictions, a certain number of digests\r\nof my memoranda, setting forth what I saw, heard, and learned in some of\r\nthe departments which I visited with most pleasure and profit.\r\n\r\nIn doing this I have written out what I found in my note-books less\r\nfully than the importance of the questions involved might warrant. But\r\nwhat I have written, I have written out fairly and as exactly as I\r\ncould. I do not hold myself responsible for the often severe and\r\nsometimes scornful judgments pronounced by my friends in the provinces\r\nupon public men at Paris. But I had no right to modify or withhold\r\nthem. In the case of conversations held with friends, or with casual\r\nacquaintances, I have used names only where I had reason to believe\r\nthat, adding weight to what was recorded, they might be used without\r\ninjury or inconvenience of any kind to my interlocutors.\r\n\r\nThe sum of my conclusions is suggested in the title of this book. I\r\nspeak of France as one thing, and of the Republic as another thing. I do\r\nnot speak of the French Republic, for the Republic as it now exists does\r\nnot seem to me to be French, and France, as I have found it, is\r\ncertainly not Republican.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Third French Republic, as it exists to-day, is just ten years old.\r\n\r\nIt owes its being, not to any direct action of the French people, but to\r\nthe success of a Parliamentary revolution, chiefly organised by M.\r\nGambetta. The ostensible object of this revolution was to prevent the\r\nrestoration of the French Monarchy. The real object of it was to take\r\nthe life of the executive authority in France. M. Gambetta fell by the\r\nway, but the evil he did lives after him.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the celebrities of an age in which celebrity has almost\r\nceased to be a distinction. But the measure of his political capacity is\r\ngiven in the fact that he was an active promoter of the insurrection of\r\nSeptember 4, 1870, in Paris against the authority of the Empress\r\nEugénie. A more signal instance is not to be found in history of that\r\nsupreme form of public stupidity which President Lincoln stigmatised, in\r\na memorable phrase, as the operation of 'swapping horses while crossing\r\na stream.'\r\n\r\nIt was worse than an error or a crime, it was simply silly. The\r\ninevitable effect of it was to complete the demoralisation of the French\r\narmies, and to throw France prostrate before her conquerors. A very\r\nwell-known German said to me a few years ago at Lucerne, where we were\r\ndiscussing the remarkable trial of Richter, the dynamiter of the\r\nNiederwald: 'Ah! we owe much to Gambetta, and Jules Favre, and Thiers,\r\nand the French Republic. They saved us from a social revolution by\r\nparalysing France. We could never have exacted of the undeposed Emperor\r\nat Wilhelmshöhe, with the Empress at Paris, the terms which those\r\nblubbering jumping-jacks were glad to accept from us on their knees.'\r\n\r\nThe imbecility of September 4, 1870, was capped by the lunacy of the\r\nCommune of Paris in 1871. This latter was more than France could bear,\r\nand a wholesome breeze of national feeling stirs in the 'murders grim\r\nand great,' by which the victorious Army of Versailles avenged the\r\ncowardly massacre of the hostages, and the destruction of the Tuileries\r\nand the Hôtel de Ville.\r\n\r\nWith what 'mandate,' and by whom conferred, M. Thiers went to Bordeaux\r\nin 1871, is a thorny question, into which I need not here enter. What he\r\nmight have done for his country is, perhaps, uncertain. What he did we\r\nknow. He founded a republic of which, in one of his characteristic\r\nphrases, he said that: 'it must be Conservative, or it could not be,'\r\nand this he did with the aid of men without whose concurrence it would\r\nhave been impossible, and of whom he knew perfectly well that they were\r\nfully determined the Republic should not be Conservative. He became\r\nChief of the State, and this for a time, no doubt, he imagined would\r\nsuffice to make the State Conservative.\r\n\r\nHe was supported by an Assembly in which the Monarchists of France\r\npredominated. The triumphant invasion and the imminent peril of the\r\ncountry had brought monarchical France into the field as one man. M.\r\nGambetta's absurd Government of the National Defence, even in that\r\nsupreme moment of danger when the Uhlans were hunting it from pillar to\r\npost, actually compelled the Princes of the House of France to fight for\r\ntheir country under assumed names, but it could not prevent the sons of\r\nall the historic families of France from risking their lives against the\r\npublic enemy. All over France a general impulse of public confidence put\r\nthe French Conservatives forward as the men in whose hands the\r\nreconstitution of the shattered nation would be safest. The popular\r\ninstinct was justified by the result.\r\n\r\nFrom 1871 to 1877, France was governed, under the form of a republic, by\r\na majority of men who neither had, nor professed to have, any more\r\nconfidence in the stability of a republican form of government, than\r\nAlexander Hamilton had in the working value of the American Constitution\r\nwhich he so largely helped to frame, and which he accepted as being the\r\nbest it was possible in the circumstances to get. But they did their\r\nduty to France, as he did his duty to America. To them--first under M.\r\nThiers, and then under the Maréchal-Duc de Magenta--France is indebted\r\nfor the reconstruction of her beaten and disorganised army, for the\r\nsuccessful liquidation of the tremendous war-indemnity imposed upon her\r\nby victorious Germany, for the re-establishment of her public credit,\r\nand for such an administration of her national finances as enabled her,\r\nin 1876, to raise a revenue of nearly a thousand millions of francs, or\r\nforty millions of pounds sterling, in excess of the revenue raised under\r\nthe Empire seven years before, without friction and without undue\r\npressure. In 1869, the Empire had raised a revenue of 1,621,390,248\r\nfrancs. In 1876, the Conservative Republic raised a revenue of\r\n2,570,505,513 francs. With this it covered all the cost of the public\r\nservice, carried the charges resulting from the war and its\r\nconsequences, set apart 204,000,000 francs for public works, and yet\r\nleft in the Treasury a balance of 98,000,000 francs.\r\n\r\nIt is told of one of the finance ministers of the Restoration, Baron\r\nLouis, that when a deputy questioned him once about the finances, he\r\nreplied, 'Do you give us good politics and I will give you good\r\nfinances.' It seems to me that the budget of 1876 proves the politics of\r\nthe Conservative majority in the French Parliament of that time to have\r\nbeen good. The Maréchal-Duc de Magenta was then president. M. Thiers had\r\nresigned his office in 1873, in consequence of a dispute with the\r\nAssembly, the true history of which may one day be edifying, and the\r\nAssembly had elected the Maréchal-Duc to fill his place.\r\n\r\nI have been told by one of the most distinguished public men in France\r\nthat, in his passionate desire to prevent the election of the Maréchal\r\nDuc, M. Thiers was bent upon promoting a movement to bring against the\r\nsoldier of Magenta an accusation like that which led to the condemnation\r\nof the Maréchal Bazaine, and that he was with difficulty restrained from\r\ndoing this.\r\n\r\nMonstrous as this attempt would have been, it hardly seems more\r\nmonstrous than the abortive attempt which was actually made, under the\r\ninspiration of M. Gambetta and his friends, to convict the Maréchal Duc\r\nand his ministers, 'the men of the 16th of May,' of conspiring, while in\r\npossession of the executive power, to bring about the overthrow of the\r\nRepublic and the restoration of the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nM. Gambetta and his party having formed in 1877 what is known as 'the\r\nalliance of the 363,' determined to drive the Maréchal-Duc from the\r\nPresidency, to take the control of public affairs entirely into their\r\nown hands, and to reduce the Executive to the position created for Louis\r\nXVI. by the revolutionists of the First Republic, before the atrocious\r\nplot of August 10, 1792, made an end of the monarchy and of public order\r\naltogether, and prepared the way for the massacres of September. Whether\r\nthe Maréchal-Duc might not have resisted this revolutionary conspiracy\r\nto the end it is not worth while now to inquire. Suffice it that he gave\r\nway finally, and, refusing to submit to the degradation of the high post\r\nhe held, accepted M. Gambetta's alternative and relinquished it.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the true aim of the Republicans (who had carried\r\nthe elections of 1877 by persuading France that Germany would at once\r\ninvade the country if the Conservatives won the day) is sufficiently\r\nattested by the fact that they chose, as the successor of the\r\nMaréchal-Duc, a public man chiefly conspicuous for the efforts he had\r\nmade to secure the abolition of the Executive office!\r\n\r\nM. Grévy had failed to get the Presidency of the Republic suppressed\r\nwhen the organic law was passed in 1875. He was more successful when, on\r\nJanuary 30, 1879, he consented to accept the Presidency. When he entered\r\nthe Elysée, the executive authority went out of it. The Third French\r\nRepublic, such as it now exists, was constituted on that day--the\r\nanniversary, by the way, oddly enough, of the decapitation of Charles I.\r\nof England at Whitehall.\r\n\r\nThat is the date, not 'centennial,' but 'decennial,' which ought to have\r\nbeen celebrated in 1889 by the Third French Republic. In his first\r\nMessage, February 7, 1879, M. Grévy formally said: 'I will never resist\r\nthe national will expressed by its constitutional organs.' From that\r\nmoment the parliamentary majority became the Government of France.\r\n\r\nSomething very like this French parliamentary revolution of 1879 to\r\nwhich France is indebted for the Third Republic as it exists to-day, was\r\nattempted in the United States about ten years before.\r\n\r\nIn both instances the intent of the parliamentary revolutionists was to\r\ntake the life of a Constitution without modifying its forms. The failure\r\nof the American is not less instructive than the success of the French\r\nparliamentary revolution, and as all my readers, perhaps, are not as\r\nfamiliar with American political history as with some other topics, I\r\nhope I may be pardoned for briefly pointing this out.\r\n\r\nUpon the assassination of President Lincoln in April 1865 the\r\nVice-President, Andrew Johnson, became President. He was a Southern man,\r\nand as one of the Senators from the Southern State of Tennessee he had\r\nrefused to go with his State in her secession from the Union. To this he\r\nowed his association on the Presidential ticket with Mr. Lincoln at the\r\nelection in 1864. He was no more and no less opposed to slavery in the\r\nabstract than President Lincoln, of whom it is well known that he\r\nregarded his own now famous proclamation of 1863 freeing the slaves in\r\nthe seceded States, as an illegal concession to the Anti-Slavery feeling\r\nof the North and of Europe, and that he spoke of it with undisguised\r\ncontempt, as a 'Pope's bull against the comet.' Like Mr. Lincoln, Andrew\r\nJohnson was devoted to the Union, but he was a Constitutional Democrat\r\nin his political opinions, and the Civil War having ended in the defeat\r\nof the Confederacy, he gradually settled down to his constitutional\r\nduty, as President of the United States, towards the States which had\r\nformed the Confederacy. This earned for him the bitter hostility of the\r\nthen dominant majority in both Houses of Congress, led by a man of\r\nunbridled passions and of extraordinary energy, Thaddeus Stevens, a\r\nrepresentative from Pennsylvania, a sort of American Couthon, infirm of\r\nbody but all compact of will. It was the purpose of this majority to\r\nhumiliate and chastise, not to conciliate, the defeated South. Already,\r\nunder President Lincoln, this purpose had brought the leaders of the\r\nmajority more than once into collision with the Executive. Under\r\nPresident Johnson they forced a collision with the Veto power of the\r\nPresident, by two unconstitutional bills, one attainting the whole\r\npeople of the South, and the other aimed at the authority of the\r\nExecutive over his officers. In the policy thus developed they had the\r\nco-operation of the Secretary at War, Mr. Stanton, and during the recess\r\nof Congress in August 1867 it became apparent that with his assistance\r\nthey meant to subjugate the Executive. President Johnson quickly brought\r\nmatters to an issue. He first, during the recess, suspended Mr. Stanton\r\nfrom the War Office, putting General Grant in charge of it, and upon the\r\nreassembling of Congress in December 1867 'removed' him, and directed\r\nhim to hand over his official portfolio to General Thomas, appointed to\r\nfill the place _ad interim_. Thereupon the majority of the House carried\r\nthrough that body a resolution of impeachment, prepared, by a committee,\r\nthe necessary articles, and brought the President to trial before the\r\nSenate, constituted as a court for 'high crimes and misdemeanours.' Two\r\nof the articles of impeachment were founded upon disrespect alleged to\r\nhave been publicly shown by the President to Congress. The President, by\r\nhis counsel, among whom were Mr. Evarts, since then Secretary of State,\r\nand now a Senator for New York, and Mr. Stanberry, an Attorney-General\r\nof the United States, appeared before the Senate on March 13, 1868. The\r\nPresident asked for forty days, in which to prepare an answer. The\r\nSenate, without a division, refused this, and ordered the answer to be\r\nfiled within ten days. The trial finally began on March 30, and, after\r\nkeeping the country at fever-heat for two months, ended on May 26, in\r\nthe failure of the impeachment. Only three out of the eleven articles\r\nwere voted upon. Upon each thirty-five Senators voted the President to\r\nbe 'Guilty,' and nineteen Senators voted him to be 'Not guilty.' As the\r\nConstitution of the United States requires a two-thirds vote in such a\r\ntrial, the Chief Justice declared the President to be acquitted, and the\r\nattempt of the Legislature to dominate the Executive was defeated. Seven\r\nof the nineteen Senators voting 'Not guilty' were of the Republican\r\nparty which had impeached the President, and it will be seen that a\r\nchange of one vote in the minority would have carried the day for the\r\nrevolutionists. So narrow was our escape from a peril which the founders\r\nof the Constitution had foreseen, and against which they had devised all\r\nthe safeguards possible in the circumstances of the United States. What,\r\nin such a case, would become of a French President?\r\n\r\nThe American President is not elected by Congress except in certain not\r\nvery probable contingencies, and when the House votes for a President,\r\nit votes not by members but by delegations, each state of the Union\r\ncasting one vote. The French President is elected by a convention of the\r\nSenate and the Chamber of Deputies, in which every member has a vote,\r\nand the result is determined by an actual majority. The Senate of the\r\nUnited States is entirely independent of the House. A large proportion\r\nof the members of the French Senate are elected by the Assembly, and the\r\nChamber outnumbers the Senate by nearly two to one. What the procedure\r\nof the French Senate, sitting as a High Court on the impeachment of a\r\nPresident by the majority of the Chamber, would probably be, may be\r\ngathered from the recent trial by that body of General Boulanger.\r\n\r\nWith the resignation of the Maréchal-Duc and the election of M. Grévy\r\nthe Government of France, ten years ago, became what it now is--a\r\nparliamentary oligarchy, with absolutely no practical check upon its\r\nwill except the recurrence every four years of the legislative\r\nelections. And as these elections are carried out under the direct\r\ncontrol, through the prefects and the mayors, of the Minister of the\r\nInterior, himself a member of the parliamentary oligarchy, the weakness\r\nof this check might be easily inferred, had it not been demonstrated by\r\nfacts during the elections of September 22 and October 6, 1889.\r\n\r\nHow secure this parliamentary oligarchy feels itself to be, when once\r\nthe elections are over, appears from the absolutely cynical coolness\r\nwith which the majority goes about what is called the work of\r\n'invalidating' the election of members of the minority. Something of the\r\nsort went on in my own country during the 'Reconstruction' period which\r\nfollowed the Civil War, but it never assumed the systematic form now\r\nfamiliar in France. As practised under the Third Republic it revives the\r\nspirit of the methods by which Robespierre and the sections 'corrected\r\nthe mistakes' made by the citizens of Paris in choosing representatives\r\nnot amenable to the discipline of the 'sea-green incorruptible'; and as\r\na matter of principle, leads straight on to that usurpation of all the\r\npowers of the State by a conspiracy of demagogues which followed the\r\nsubsidized Parisian insurrection of August 10, 1792.\r\n\r\nSuch a _régime_ as this sufficiently explains the phenomenon of\r\n'Boulangism,' by which Englishmen and Americans are so much perplexed.\r\nPut any people into the machinery of a centralized administrative\r\ndespotism in which the Executive is merely the instrument of a majority\r\nof the legislature, and what recourse is there left to the people but\r\n'Boulangism'? 'Boulangism' is the instinctive, more or less deliberate\r\nand articulate, outcry of a people living under constitutional forms,\r\nbut conscious that, by some hocus-pocus, the vitality has been taken out\r\nof those forms. It is the expression of the general sense of insecurity.\r\nIn a country situated as France now is, it is natural that this\r\ninarticulate outcry should merge itself at first into a clamour for the\r\nrevision of a Constitution which has been made a delusion and a snare;\r\nand then into a clamour for a dynasty which shall afford the nation\r\nassurance of an enduring Executive raised above the storm of party\r\npassions, and sobering the triumph of party majorities with a wholesome\r\nsense of responsibility to the nation.\r\n\r\nThere would have been no lack of 'Boulangism' in France forty years ago\r\nhad M. Thiers and his legislative cabal got the better of the Prince\r\nPresident in the 'struggle for life' which then went on between the\r\nPlace St.-Georges and the Elysée!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere are two periods, one in the history of modern England, the other\r\nin the history of the United States, which directly illuminate the\r\nhistory of France since the overthrow of the ancient French Monarchy in\r\n1792.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the period of the Long Parliament in England. The other\r\nis the brief but most important interval which elapsed between the\r\nrecognition of the independence of the thirteen seceded British colonies\r\nin America, at Versailles in 1783, and the first inauguration of\r\nWashington as President of the United States at New York on April 30,\r\n1789. No Englishman or American, who is reasonably familiar with the\r\nhistory of either of these periods, will hastily attribute the phenomena\r\nof modern French politics to something essentially volatile and unstable\r\nin the character of the French people.\r\n\r\nMy own acquaintance, such as it is, with France--for I should be sorry\r\nto pretend to a thorough knowledge of France, or of any country not my\r\nown--goes back, as I have intimated, to the early days of the Second\r\nEmpire. It has been my good fortune, at various times, to see a good\r\ndeal of the social and political life of France, and I long ago learned\r\nthat to talk of the character of the French people is almost as slipshod\r\nand careless as to talk of the character of the Italian people.\r\n\r\nThe French people are not the outgrowth of a common stock, like the\r\nDutch or the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe people of Provence are as different in all essential particulars\r\nfrom the people of Brittany, the people of French Flanders from the\r\npeople of Gascony, the people of Savoy from the people of Normandy, as\r\nare the people of Kent from the people of the Scottish Highlands, or the\r\npeople of Yorkshire from the people of Wales. The French nation was the\r\nwork, not of the French people, but of the kings of France, not less but\r\neven more truly than the Italian nation, such as we see it gradually now\r\nforming, is the work of the royal House of Savoy.\r\n\r\nThe sudden suppression of the National Executive by a parliamentary\r\nconspiracy at Paris in 1792 violently interrupted the orderly and\r\nnatural making of France, just as the sudden suppression of the National\r\nExecutive in 1649 after the occupation of Edinburgh by Argyll and the\r\nsurrender of Colchester to Fairfax had put England at the mercy of\r\nCromwell's 'honest' troopers, and of knavish fanatics like Hugh Peters,\r\nviolently interrupted the making of Britain. It took England a century\r\nto recover her equilibrium. Between Naseby Field in 1645 and Culloden\r\nMoor in 1746 England had, except during the reign of Charles II., no\r\nbetter assurance of continuous domestic peace than France enjoyed first\r\nunder Louis Philippe and then under the Second Empire. During those\r\nhundred years Englishmen were thought by the rest of Europe to be as\r\nexcitable, as volatile, and as unstable as Frenchmen are not uncommonly\r\nthought by the rest of mankind now to be. There is a curious old Dutch\r\nprint of these days in which England appears as a son of Adam in the\r\nhereditary costume, standing at gaze amid a great disorder of garments\r\nstrewn upon the floor, while a scroll displayed above him bears this\r\nlegend:\r\n\r\n  I am an Englishman, and naked I stand here,\r\n  Musing in my mind what garment I shall wear.\r\n  Now I will wear this, and now I will wear that,\r\n  And now I will wear--I don't know what!\r\n\r\nThere was as much--and as little--reason thus to depict the England of\r\nthe seventeenth, as there is thus to depict the France of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIf there had ever been, a hundred years ago, such a thing as a French\r\nRepublic, founded, as the American Republic of 1787 was founded, by the\r\ndeliberate will of the people, and offering them a reasonable prospect\r\nof maintaining liberty and law, that Republic would exist to-day. That\r\nwe are watching the desperate effort of a centralised parliamentary\r\ndespotism at Paris in the year 1890 to maintain a 'Third Republic' is\r\nconclusive proof that this was not the case.\r\n\r\nFrance--the French people, that is--- had no more to do with the\r\noverthrow of the monarchy of Louis XVI., with the fall of the monarchy\r\nof Charles X., with the collapse of the monarchy of July, or with the\r\nabolition of the Second Empire, than with the abdication of Napoleon I.\r\nat Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nNot one of these catastrophes was provoked by France or the French\r\npeople; not one of them was ever submitted by its authors to the French\r\npeople for approval.\r\n\r\nOnly two French governments during the past century can be accurately\r\nsaid to have been definitely branded and condemned as failures by the\r\ndeliberate voice of the French people. One of these was the First\r\nRepublic, which after going through a series of convulsions equally\r\ngrotesque and ghastly, was swept into oblivion by an overwhelming vote\r\nof the French people in response to the appeal of the first Napoleon.\r\nThe other was the Second Republic, which was put upon trial by the Third\r\nNapoleon on December 10, 1851, and condemned to immediate extinction by\r\na vote of 7,439,219 to 640,737. I am at a loss to see how it is possible\r\nto deduce from these simple facts of French history the conclusion that\r\nthe French people are, and for a century have been, madly bent upon\r\ngetting a Republic established in France, unless, indeed, I am to\r\nsuppose that the French Republicans proceed upon the principle said to\r\nbe justified by the experience of countries in which the standard of\r\nmercantile morality is not absolutely puritanical--that three successive\r\nbankruptcies will enable a really clever man to retire from business\r\nwith a handsome fortune!\r\n\r\nIf it were possible, as happily it is impossible, that the American\r\npeople could be afflicted with a single year of such a Republic as that\r\nwhich now exists in France, we would rid ourselves of it, if necessary,\r\nby seeking annexation to Canada under the crown of our common ancestors,\r\nor by inviting the exiled Dom Pedro to recross the Atlantic and accept\r\nthe throne of a North American Empire, with substantial guarantees that\r\nif we should ever change our minds and put him politely on board a ship\r\nagain for Europe, the cheque given to him on his departure would not be\r\ndishonoured on presentation to the national bankers!\r\n\r\nIt is the penalty, I suppose, of our position in the United States, as\r\nthe first and, so far, the only successful great republic of modern\r\ntimes, that we are expected to accept a sort of moral responsibility for\r\nall the experiments in republicanism, no matter how absurd, odious, or\r\npreposterous they may be, which it may come into the heads of people\r\nanywhere else in the world to try. I do not see why Americans who are\r\nnot under some strenuous necessity of making stump speeches in or out of\r\nCongress, with an eye to some impending election, should submit to this\r\nwithout a protest. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery: it\r\ndoes not follow that it is the most agreeable.\r\n\r\nI do not know that Western drawing-rooms take more delight in the\r\nJapanese, who most amiably present themselves everywhere in the\r\nregulation dress-coat and white cravat of modern Christendom, than in\r\nthe Chinese, who calmly and haughtily persist in wearing the ample,\r\nstately, and comfortable garments of their own people.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the French Republican Constitution of 1875 did the United\r\nStates the honour to copy incorrectly, and absolutely to misapply,\r\ncertain leading features of our organic law. In order to accomplish\r\npurposes absolutely inconsistent with all American ideas of liberty and\r\nof justice, the parliamentary revolutionists who got possession of power\r\nin France in 1879 have so twisted to their own ends this French\r\nConstitution of 1875, that their government of the Third French Republic\r\nin 1890 really resembles the government of the Akhoond of Swat about as\r\nnearly as it resembles the government of the American Republic under\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary revolutionists of the Third French Republic are\r\nRepublicans first and then Frenchmen. The framers of the American\r\nRepublic were Americans first and then Republicans. The Republic which\r\nthey framed was an experiment imposed upon the American people, not by\r\nphilosophers and fanatics, but by the force of circumstances. The ablest\r\nof the men who framed it were not Republicans by theory. On the\r\ncontrary, they had been born and bred under a monarchy. Under that\r\nmonarchy they had enjoyed a measure of civil and religious liberty which\r\nthe Third Republic certainly refuses to Frenchmen in France to-day. M.\r\nJules Ferry and M. Constans have no lessons to give in law or in liberty\r\nto which George Washington, or John Adams, or even Thomas Jefferson,\r\nwould have listened with toleration while the Crown still adorned the\r\nlegislative halls of the British colonies in America. Our difficulties\r\nwith the mother country began, not with the prerogative of the\r\nCrown--that gave our fathers so little trouble that one of the original\r\nthirteen States lived and prospered under a royal charter from Charles\r\nII. down to the middle of the nineteenth century--but with the\r\nencroachments of the Parliament. The roots of the affection which binds\r\nAmericans to the American Republic strike deep down into the history of\r\nAmerican freedom under the British monarchy. The forms have changed, the\r\nliving substance is the same. Americans know at least as well as\r\nEnglishmen what the most intelligent of French Republicans apparently\r\nhave still to learn, that liberty is impossible without loyalty to\r\nsomething higher than self-interest and self-will.\r\n\r\nThis sufficiently explains to me a remark often cited as made to Sir\r\nTheodore Martin by General Grant during the ex-President's visit to\r\nEngland, to the effect that Englishmen 'live under institutions which\r\nAmericans would give their ears to possess.'\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant neither was, nor did he pretend to be, a great statesman.\r\nBut he was an American of the Americans. Four years of Civil War and\r\neight years of Presidential power had not been thrown away upon him. He\r\ncame into the Presidency as the successor of Andrew Johnson, who was\r\nmade President by the bullet of an assassin, and who was impeached, as I\r\nhave said, before the Senate for doing his plain constitutional duty, by\r\nan unscrupulous parliamentary cabal.\r\n\r\nHe left the Presidency, to be succeeded in it by a President who derived\r\nthe more than doubtful title under which he took his seat from a\r\nCommission unknown to the Constitution, and accepted by the American\r\npeople only as the alternative of political chaos and of a fresh civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThrough his position at the head of the American army, General Grant, as\r\nI have already mentioned, had been drawn into the contest between\r\nPresident Johnson and the parliamentary cabal bent on breaking down the\r\nconstitutional authority of the Executive.\r\n\r\nGoing into the Presidency fresh from this drama, in 1869, General Grant\r\nwent out of the Presidency in 1877, after a drama not less impressive\r\nand instructive had been enacted under his eyes, which threatened for\r\nmany weeks to result in a complete failure of the machinery provided by\r\nthe American Constitution for the lawful and orderly transmission of the\r\nexecutive authority. It did, in fact, result in the adoption by Congress\r\nof an extra-constitutional expedient, by which the orderly transmission\r\nof the executive authority was secured, but the lawful transmission of\r\nit--as I believe, and as I think I have reason to know General Grant\r\nbelieved--was defeated.\r\n\r\nWhether the constitutional machinery would or would not have carried us\r\nsafely through if the final strain had been put upon it, is now an\r\nacademic question not here to be discussed. But the final strain was\r\nevaded by the adoption of the extra-constitutional expedient to which I\r\nrefer. An Electoral Commission was created by Congress to decide by\r\nwhich of two sets of Presidential electors claiming to have been chosen\r\nfor that purpose the Presidential vote of certain States should be cast;\r\nand it is a curious circumstance that General Grant, who had seen his\r\nexecutive predecessor saved from removal by a single vote in the Senate\r\nin 1869, saw his executive successor established in the White House, in\r\n1877, by a single vote in this Electoral Commission.\r\n\r\nIt would have been strange indeed had the experience of General Grant\r\nfailed to impress upon him, with at least equal force, the advantages to\r\nliberty of a hereditary executive acting as the fountain of social\r\nhonour, and the disadvantages to liberty of an elective executive\r\ntending to become a distributing reservoir of political patronage.\r\n\r\nI once had a curious talk bearing on this subject with General Grant\r\nafter he had retired from the Presidency. He had dined with me to meet\r\nand discuss a matter of some importance with a Mexican friend of mine,\r\nSeñor Romero, long Minister of Finance in Mexico, and now Mexican Envoy\r\nat Washington. When I next met the ex-President he reverted with great\r\ninterest to something which had been incidentally said at this dinner\r\nabout the experiment of empire made in Mexico by Iturbide, the general\r\nwho finally broke the power of Spain in that viceroyalty, and secured\r\nits independence. I showed him certain documents which I had obtained in\r\nMexico through the kindness of Maximilian's very able Foreign Minister,\r\nSeñor Ramirez, a most accomplished bibliophile, bearing upon Iturbide's\r\nplan for making the American Mediterranean a Mexican lake. He expected\r\nto break up the United States by asserting the right of the Mexican\r\nEmpire to the mouths of the Mississippi, and the whole Spanish dominion\r\nas far as the Capes of Florida. 'It seems a mad thing now,' said the\r\nex-President, 'but it was not so mad perhaps then,' and we went on to\r\ndiscuss the schemes of Burr and Wilkinson and the alleged treason of an\r\nearly Tennessean senator. 'Perhaps it was not a bad thing for us,' he\r\nsaid, 'that the Mexicans shot their first Emperor--but was it a good\r\nthing for them?' 'I have sometimes wondered,' he added, 'what would have\r\nhappened to us if Gates, or--what was at one time, as you know, quite on\r\nthe cards--Benedict Arnold, instead of George Washington, had commanded\r\nthe armies of the colonies successfully down to the end at Yorktown.'\r\n\r\nWhat indeed! That is a pregnant query, not hastily to be dealt with by\r\ngenial after-dinner oratory about the self-governing capacity of the\r\nAnglo-Norman race--still less by Fourth of July declamations over what\r\nthe leader of the Massachusetts Bar used to call the 'glittering\r\ngeneralities' of the American Declaration of Independence!\r\n\r\nThe experience of the Latin states of the New World throws useful\r\nside-lights upon it. Of all these states between the Rio Grande and Cape\r\nHorn, only one began and has lived out its round half-century of\r\nindependence without serious civil convulsions. This is--or rather\r\nwas--the Empire of Brazil, of which Dom Pedro I., of the Portuguese\r\nreigning house of Braganza, on March 25, 1824, swore to maintain the\r\nintegrity and indivisibility, and to observe, and cause to be observed,\r\nthe political Constitution. That oath the Emperor and his son and\r\nsuccessor, Dom Pedro II., who took it after him in due course, seem to\r\nhave conscientiously kept. It does not appear to have impressed itself\r\nas deeply upon the consciences of the military and naval officers of the\r\npresent day in Brazil, all of whom, of course, must have taken it\r\nsubstantially on receiving their commission from the chief of the State,\r\nand it now remains to be seen what will become hereafter of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Brazilian Constitution fully recognised the\r\nimpossibility of maintaining a constitutional government without some\r\nguarantee of the independence of the Executive. They found this\r\nguarantee not by applying checks and balances to the elective\r\nprinciple, but simply in the hereditary principle, just as they found\r\nthe guarantee of the independence of the judiciary in the life-tenure of\r\nthe magistrates, and they introduced into their Constitution what they\r\ncalled a 'moderating power.' This power was lodged, by the 98th article\r\nof the Brazilian Constitution, with the Emperor--and the article thus\r\nruns: 'The moderating power is the key of the whole political\r\norganisation, and it is delegated exclusively to the Emperor, as the\r\nsupreme chief of the nation and its first representative, that he may\r\nincessantly watch over the maintenance of the independence, equilibrium,\r\nand harmony of the other political powers.'\r\n\r\nThe key of the 'political organisation' of Brazil seems to have worked\r\nvery well for fifty years. Now that it has been thrown away, it will be\r\ninteresting to watch the results.\r\n\r\nThe question, with us in the United States, from the beginning has been\r\nwhether the carefully devised provisions of oar organic Constitution of\r\n1787 would or would not be found in practice to protect the sentiment of\r\nloyalty to a National Union as effectually against popular caprice and\r\npolitical intrigues as the sentiment of loyalty to a National Crown has\r\nbeen protected in England by the hereditary principle. The American\r\nRevolution of 1776, and the foundation of the American Republic of 1787,\r\ncan never be understood without a thorough appreciation of the fact that\r\nthe issues involved in the English Revolution which placed the daughter\r\nof James II. on the English throne, and in the establishment\r\nsubsequently of the House of Hanover, because it was an offshoot of the\r\ndethroned House of Stuart, were quite as intelligently discussed, and\r\nquite as thoroughly worked out, among the English in America as among\r\nthe English in England. Without a thorough appreciation of this fact it\r\nis impossible to understand the conservative value to liberty in the\r\nUnited States, of the personal position and the personal influence of\r\nthe first American President. Washington was, in truth, the uncrowned\r\nking of the new nation--'first in war, first in peace, first in the\r\nhearts of his countrymen.' What more and what less than this is there in\r\nthe history of Alfred the Great?\r\n\r\nWashington founded no dynasty, but he made the American Presidency\r\npossible, and the American President is a king with a veto, elected, not\r\nby the people directly, but by special electors, for four years, and\r\nre-eligible. We celebrate the birthday of Washington like the birthday\r\nof a king. The same instinct gave his name to the capital of his nation,\r\nand that name was found a name to conjure with when the great stress\r\ncame of the Civil War in 1861. The sentiment of loyalty, developed and\r\ntwined about that name and about the Union which Washington had founded,\r\nwas not only the glow at the core of the Northern resistance to\r\nsecession: it was the secret and the explanation of that sudden revival\r\nof the spirit of national loyalty at the South after the war was over\r\nand an end was put to the villanies of 'Reconstruction,' by which\r\nEuropean observers of American affairs have been and still are so much\r\npuzzled. For it must be remembered that the Father of his Country was a\r\nson of the South, and that his native state, Virginia, is the oldest of\r\nthe American Commonwealths, and is known as 'the Mother of Presidents.'\r\nThe historic Union is as much Southern as Northern. Its existence was\r\nput in peril in 1812 by the States of the extreme North. Its integrity\r\nwas shattered for a time in 1861 by the States of the South. Before it\r\nwas founded, in 1787, there was no such thing as an American nation.\r\nThere were thirteen independent American States which for certain\r\npurposes only had formed what was described as a 'perpetual union,'\r\nunder certain Articles of Confederation. These Articles were drawn up in\r\n1778, at a time when the event of the war with the mother country was\r\nstill most uncertain, and they were never finally ratified by all the\r\nStates until 1781, two years before the Peace of Versailles. Under these\r\nArticles the national affairs of the Confederacy were controlled by the\r\nCongress of the States. No national Executive existed, not even such a\r\nnominal Executive as now exists in France. National affairs were managed\r\nduring the recess of the Congress by a Committee, and this Committee\r\ncould only confide the Presidency to any one member of the Committee for\r\none year at a time out of three years. This was even worse than the\r\nelective kingship without a veto of the English Republicans of 1649. But\r\nhow were the people of these thirteen independent States, each with a\r\nhistory, with interests, with prejudices, with sympathies of its own, to\r\nbe brought together and induced to form, through a more perfect union, a\r\nnation, in the only way in which a nation can be formed, by the\r\nestablishment of an independent national Executive?\r\n\r\nThis was the question which was met and answered only after long\r\ndebates, and with infinite difficulty, by the American Constitutional\r\nConvention of 1787. It is more than probable that this convention could\r\nnever have been held without the influence and the presence of George\r\nWashington, who presided over its deliberations; and it is as certain as\r\nanything human can be, that the constitution which it framed would never\r\nhave been accepted by the people of the States if they had not known\r\nthat the executive office created by it would be filled by him.\r\n\r\nThe political safeguards put about the American Executive by the\r\nconstitution may or may not always resist such a strain as has already\r\nmore than once been put upon them. The seceding States, in their\r\nconstitution adopted at Montgomery in 1861, tried to strengthen these\r\nsafeguards by extending the presidential term to six years, and making\r\nthe President re-eligible only after an interval of six years more. But\r\nall our national experience goes to show that the more difficult it is\r\nfor a mere majority of the people to make or unmake the authority which\r\nsets a final sanction upon the execution of the laws, the greater will\r\nbe the safety of the public liberty and of private rights.\r\n\r\nSo true is this that every American who witnessed, at London in 1887,\r\nthe Jubilee of the Queen, felt, and was glad to feel, with a natural and\r\ninstinctive sympathy, the honest contagion of that magnificent outburst\r\nof the loyalty of a great and free people to the hereditary\r\nrepresentative of their historic liberties and of their historic law. I\r\nam sure that no intelligent Englishman can have witnessed the\r\ntremendous outpouring of the American people into New York on April 30,\r\n1889, to do honour there to the hundredth anniversary of the first\r\ninauguration of George Washington, without a kindred emotion.\r\n\r\nTo compare with the significance of either of these scenes that of the\r\ngigantic cosmopolitan fair dedicated at Paris in 1889 by President\r\nCarnot to the 'principles of 1789' is to exhaust the resources of the\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe antagonism which now exists between France and the Third Republic\r\ncertainly did not exist between France and the ancient monarchy. The\r\nmembers of the États-Généraux of 1789, who were so soon permitted, by\r\nthe incapacity of Louis XVI., to resolve that body into the chaotic mob\r\nwhich assumed the name of a National Assembly, were elected, not at all\r\nto change the fabric of the French Government, but simply to reform, in\r\nconcert with the king, abuses, two-thirds of which were virtually\r\ndefunct when the king took off his hat to the Three Orders at Versailles\r\non the 5th of May, 1789, and the rest of which took a new lease of life,\r\noften under new names, from the follies and the crimes of the First\r\nRepublic, after the 22nd of September, 1792. Two contemporary observers,\r\nwatching the drama from very different points of view, Arthur Young and\r\nGouverneur Morris, long ago discerned this. M. Henri Taine, and the\r\ngroup of conscientious historical students who, during the last quarter\r\nof a century, have been reconstructing the annals of the revolutionary\r\nperiod, have put it beyond all doubt. The enormous majority of the\r\nFrench people, and even of the people of Paris, were so little\r\ninfatuated with the 'principles of 1789' that they regarded the advent\r\nto power of the first Napoleon with inexpressible relief, as making an\r\nend of what Arthur Young calls, and not too sternly, a series of\r\nconstitutions 'formed by conventions of rabble and sanctioned by the\r\n_sans-culottes_ of the kennel.' Without fully understanding this, it is\r\nimpossible to understand either the history of the Napoleons, or the\r\npresent antagonism between France and the Third Republic.\r\n\r\nOf this I am so deeply convinced that I have thought it right to\r\ninterweave, when occasion offered, with my account of things as they are\r\nin France, what I believe to be the historic truth as to things as they\r\nwere in France at and before the period of the Revolution. To judge the\r\nFrance of 1890 fairly, and forecast its future intelligently, we must\r\nthoroughly rid ourselves of the notion that the masses of the French\r\npeople had anything more to do with the dethronement and the murder of\r\nLouis XVI. than the masses of the English people had to do with the\r\ndethronement and the murder of Charles I. Neither crime was perpetrated\r\nto enlarge the liberties or to protect the interests of the people. We\r\nlong ago got at the truth about the great English rebellion. 'Pride's\r\nPurge,' the 'elective kingship without a veto of the 'New Model,' and\r\nthe merciless mystification of Bradshaw, tell their own story. Steering\r\nto avoid the Scylla of Strafford, the luckless Parliamentarians ran the\r\nship of State full into the Charybdis of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nIt is only within very recent times that the daylight of facts has begun\r\nto dissipate the mists of the French legend of 1789. Even Republican\r\nwriters of repute now disdain to concern themselves more seriously with\r\nthe so-called histories of Thiers, of Mignet, and of Lamartine than with\r\nthe _Chevalier de Maison-Rouge_ of Alexandre Dumas and the _Charlotte\r\nCorday_ of M. Ponsard.\r\n\r\nOf course the legend dies hard--all legends do. Even the whipping of\r\nTitus Oates at the cart's tail through London did not kill the legend of\r\nSir Edmondsbury Godfrey and the Popish Plot. The Republicans of the\r\nThird Republic have not scrupled to set up a statue to Danton. People\r\nwho might easily learn the truth still speak, and not in France only,\r\nabout Robespierre and Madame Roland in terms which really justify M.\r\nBiré in anticipating a time when Raoul-Rigault maybe celebrated as a\r\npatriot and Louise Michel as a heroine. No longer ago than in 1888\r\ncertain people, perhaps relying on the fact that M. Casimir Périer, the\r\nactual owner of the château at Vizille in which the famous meeting of\r\nthe Estates of Dauphiny was held in 1788, is a Republican, actually\r\nundertook to 'ring up the curtain' on the Centennial of 1789 by\r\nrepresenting Barnave and Mounier as clamouring in 1788 for a republic at\r\nVizille! Of all which let us say with Mr. Carlyle, 'What should\r\nFalsehood do but decease, being ripe, decompose itself, and return to\r\nthe Father of it?' To whom, alas! I fear, under this inexorable law must\r\nin due time revert too many of the fuliginous word-pictures of Mr.\r\nCarlyle's own dithyrambic prose concerning the 'French Revolution'!\r\n\r\nThe giants who stalked through his inflamed imagination like spectres on\r\nthe Brocken, may be seen to-day in the Musée de la Révolution at Paris,\r\nshrunken to their true proportions--a dreary procession, indeed, of\r\ndreamers, madmen, quacks and felons! How can that be called a 'Great\r\nRevolution,' of which it is recorded that before it had filled the brief\r\norbit of a decade, it had made an end of the life or of the reputation\r\nof every single man conspicuous in initiating or promoting it? The men\r\nwho began the English Revolution of 1688 organised the new order to\r\nwhich it led. The men who began the American Revolution of 1776\r\norganised the new nation which it called into being. This must have been\r\nas true of the French Revolution had it been really an outcome of the\r\n'principles of 1789,' or of any principles at all. But it was nothing of\r\nthe kind. It was simply a carnival of incapacities, ending naturally in\r\nan orgie of crime. It was in the order of Nature that it should deify\r\nMirabeau in the Pantheon, only to dig up his dishonoured remains and\r\ntrundle them under an unmarked stone at the meeting of four streets,\r\nthat it should set Bailly on a civic throne, only to drag him forth,\r\nunder a freezing sky, to his long and dismal martyrdom amid a howling\r\nmob, that it should acclaim Lafayette as the Saviour of France, only to\r\nhunt him across the frontier into an Austrian prison.\r\n\r\nIt was because France detested the Republic, and, detesting the\r\nRepublic, might at any moment recall the Bourbons, that Napoleon\r\nexecuted the Duc d'Enghien. It was to make an end of claims older than\r\nhis own upon the allegiance of a people essentially and naturally\r\nmonarchical. It was a crime, but it was not a squalid and foolish crime\r\nlike the murder of Louis XVI. It belonged to the same category with the\r\nexecution of Conradin of Hohenstaufen by Charles of Anjou--not, indeed,\r\nas to its mere atrocity, but as to its motives and its intent. It\r\nannounced to the French people the advent of a new dynasty, and left\r\nthem no choice but between the Republic and the Empire. An autograph\r\nletter of Carnot, the grandfather of the actual President of the Third\r\nRepublic, sold the other day in Paris may be cited to illustrate this\r\npoint. Carnot, like many other regicides, would gladly have made his\r\npeace with Louis XVIII. His peace with some sovereign he knew that he\r\nmust make. The letter I now refer to was written after the return of the\r\nEmperor from Elba, and it could hardly have been written had Carnot not\r\nbelieved that France might be rallied to the Empire and to its chief,\r\nbecause France could not exist without a monarchy and a monarch.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the monarchy was cordially accepted by the French\r\npeople. The American friends of France celebrated it with a banquet in\r\nNew York. France prospered under it. It laid the foundations of the\r\nFrench dominion in Africa, and thereby gave to modern France the only\r\nfield of colonial expansion which can be said, down to the present time,\r\nto have enured to any real good either for French commerce or the French\r\npeople. Certainly M. Ferry and the Republic have so far done nothing\r\nwith Tonquin to dim the lustre of the monarchical conquest of Algiers.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the Republic, through its occupation of Tunis, its\r\n'pouting policy' towards England in Egypt, and its more recent\r\nintimations of a great French Africa to be carried eastward to the\r\nAtlantic, has prepared, and is preparing, for France in the perhaps not\r\ndistant future a new chapter of political accidents upon the possible\r\ngravity and extent of which prudent Frenchmen meditate with dubious\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe sceptre passed as quietly from Louis XVIII. to Charles X. in France\r\nas from George IV. to William IV. in England. So far, indeed, as public\r\ndisorder indicates public discontent, the English monarchy was in\r\ngreater peril during the period between 1815 and 1830 than the French\r\nmonarchy. When the Revolution of July came, no man thought seriously of\r\nasking France to accept a second trial of the Republic, and the crown\r\nwas pressed upon the Duc d'Orléans, with the anxious assent of\r\nLafayette, the friend of Washington, Mirabeau's 'Grandison-Cromwell' of\r\nthe Revolution of 1789. Under the long reign of Louis Philippe France\r\nagain prospered exceedingly. French art and French literature more than\r\nrecovered their ancient prestige. Attempts were made to restore the\r\nelder branch of the Bourbons and to restore the dynasty of the\r\nBonapartes. But no serious attempt was made to restore the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1848 took even Paris by surprise. The Republic which\r\nemerged from it filled France with consternation, and opened the way at\r\nonce for the restoration of the Empire. On December 10, 1851, the French\r\npeople made the Prince-President Dictator, by a vote the significance of\r\nwhich will be only inadequately appreciated if we fail to remember that\r\nthe millions who cast it were by no means sure that, by putting the\r\nsword of France again into the hands of a Napoleon, they would not\r\nprovoke the perils of a great European war. France did not court these\r\nperils, but she preferred them to the risks of a republic.\r\n\r\nI spent many months in France at that time, and to me, remembering what\r\nI then saw and heard among all sorts and conditions of men, not in the\r\ndepartments only but in Paris itself, the persistency with which the\r\nleaders of the present Republican party have set themselves, ever since\r\nthey came definitely into power with M. Grévy in 1879, to reviving all\r\nthe most odious traditions of the earlier Republican experiments, and to\r\nre-identifying the Republic with all that the respectable masses of the\r\nFrench people most hate and dread, has seemed from the first, and now\r\nseems, little short of judicial madness.\r\n\r\nIt did not surprise me, therefore, in 1885, to find the banner of the\r\nmonarchy frankly unfurled by M. Lambert de Ste.-Croix and scores of\r\nother Conservatives, as they then called themselves, at the legislative\r\nelections of that year. It did surprise me, however, to see the strength\r\nof the support which they instantly received throughout the country. For\r\nI believe the masses of the French people to be at heart monarchical,\r\nless from any sentiment of loyalty at all either to the race of their\r\nancient kings or to the imperial dynasty, than because the experience of\r\nthe last century, to which, as I think very unwisely, the Republican\r\nGovernment has appealed in what I cannot but call its rigmarole about\r\nthe 'Centennial of 1789,' has led them to associate with the idea of a\r\nrepublic the ideas of instability and of anarchy, and with the idea of a\r\nmonarchy the ideas of stability and of order. Now the Government of the\r\nThird Republic, first under M. Thiers and then under the Maréchal-Duc of\r\nMagenta, was so conducted from 1871 to 1877 as to shake this\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nUnder it Frenchmen had seen that a Republic might actually exist in\r\nFrance for seven years without disturbing social order, interfering with\r\nfreedom of conscience, attacking the religion of the country, or wasting\r\nits substance.\r\n\r\nThere were 'wars and rumours of wars' in the air in 1876. It was very\r\nloudly whispered that Germany, alarmed by the rapid advances of France\r\ntowards a complete recovery of her national strength, meant suddenly and\r\nsavagely to strike at her; and that, unless the essentially national and\r\nmilitary Government of the Maréchal-Duc was replaced by a Government\r\nwhich would divert the resources of France largely into industrial,\r\ncommercial, and colonial adventures, a new invasion might at any moment\r\nbe feared. It ought to have been obvious that a Government which held in\r\nits hand a balance of 98,000,000 francs was much less likely to be\r\nwantonly attacked than a Government which meant to outrun its revenue.\r\nWith a declared balance of 98,000,000 francs to the good, France might\r\nraise at the shortest notice 2,000,000,000 francs in a war loan. The\r\nbalance of the Maréchal-Duc's Government was in fact a war-treasure, and\r\na war-treasure of that magnitude was a tolerably effectual guarantee of\r\npeace. This ought, I say, to have been obvious; but it is the triumph of\r\ndemagogic skill to prevent a great people from seeing as a mass what is\r\nperfectly plain to every man of them taken alone. Under the stress of a\r\nwar-panic the French people, whose dread and dislike of republics in\r\ngeneral had been lulled, as I have shown, into repose by seven years of\r\na Conservative Republican rule, were led into granting the untested\r\nRepublic of Gambetta the credit fairly earned by the tested Republic of\r\nMacmahon and of Thiers.\r\n\r\nM. Grévy, thought the incarnation of thrift, of peace at any price, and\r\nof commercial development, was elected President in 1879. M. Léon Say, a\r\nman of wealth and of business, from whom more circumspection might have\r\nbeen expected, lent himself, as Minister of the Finances, in combination\r\nwith the rather visionary M. de Freycinet, to a grand scheme devised by\r\nM. Gambetta 'in a single night,' like Aladdin's Palace, for spending\r\nindefinite millions of money upon docks, railways and ports all over\r\nFrance, wherever there was a seat in the Chamber to be kept or won. The\r\n'true Republicans,' as they call themselves, must be kept in power, the\r\nRepublicans who hold it to be their mission--no, not their mission, for\r\nthat word smacks of a Deity--but their proud prerogative, to rid France\r\nand the world of the Christian religion, to abolish all forms of worship\r\nand of monarchy from off the face of the earth, and generally to fashion\r\nthe felicity of mankind, in and out of France, after their own mind.\r\nThey went to work without delay. Having made the Executive, in the\r\nperson of M. Grévy, a puppet, they began at once, in 1879, to pour out\r\nthe money of the taxpayers like water, for what we know in the United\r\nStates as 'purposes of political irrigation'; to 'purge' the public\r\nservice, in all its branches, from the highest to the lowest, of all men\r\nnot ready to swear allegiance to their creed; to create new posts and to\r\nfill them with the dependents and parasites of the Republican party\r\nchiefs.\r\n\r\nThe balance of 98,291,105 fr. 28 c. (to be exact!) with which the\r\nRepublic of Thiers and Macmahon had closed the year 1876, rapidly\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nOn April 20, 1878, M. Léon Say announced to the Chamber of Deputies that\r\nhe expected the country to spend for 1879 a sum of 3,173,820,114 francs,\r\nand to meet this expenditure with an estimated income of 2,698,622,014\r\nfrancs!\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the expenditure of France had reached 2,680,146,977 francs, and\r\nthe income of France had reached 2,778,438,082 fr. 66 c. Two years had\r\nsufficed to reverse the situation, and to convert an excess of receipts\r\nover expenditure under the Government of the Maréchal-Duc, amounting to\r\nmore than 98,000,000 francs, into an excess of expenditure over receipts\r\nunder his 'truly Republican' successor amounting to 475,148,100 francs!\r\n\r\nFrom that moment to this the Third Republic has been steadily expending\r\nfor France year after year at least five hundred millions of francs, or\r\ntwenty millions of pounds sterling, more than it has been able to\r\ncollect from the French people in the way of normal revenue. The exact\r\namount of this monstrous deficiency it is not easy to state with\r\nprecision. So distinguished an economist as M. Leroy-Beaulieu, a\r\nRepublican of the moderate type, puts it at the sum I have stated, of\r\nfive hundred millions a year for ten years. At the elections of last\r\nyear the Carnot Government ordered, or encouraged, the Prefect of the\r\nHérault, M. Pointu-Norès, to oppose openly and energetically the\r\nelection of M. Leroy-Beaulieu as a deputy for the district of Lodève in\r\nthat department. Why? M. Leroy-Beaulieu is one of the few really able\r\nand distinguished Frenchmen, known beyond the limits of France, who may\r\nbe regarded as sincere believers in the possibility of founding a\r\nsubstantial and orderly French Republic. But M. Leroy-Beaulieu, when he\r\nsees a deficiency in the public accounts, calls it a deficiency, and\r\nlifts up his voice in warning against a policy which accepts an annual\r\ndeficiency of five hundred millions of francs as natural, normal, and to\r\nbe expected in the administration of a great Republic.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the presence of M. Leroy-Beaulieu in the Chamber of Deputies\r\nis a thing to be prevented at any price. The 'Republicans' of the\r\nHérault this year tried to prevent it not only by treating 'informal'\r\nballots thrown for him as invalid, and accepting 'informal' ballots\r\nthrown against him as valid, but, as the report of a Committee of the\r\nChamber admits, by 'irregularities' which in other countries would be\r\ndescribed in harsher terms.\r\n\r\nYet the majority of the new Chamber has postponed action upon this\r\nreport of its own Committee till after the recess, and M. Leroy-Beaulieu\r\nis not yet allowed to occupy the seat which the voters of Lodève\r\nundoubtedly chose him to fill.\r\n\r\nIf we accept M. Leroy-Beaulieu's estimate of the average annual\r\ndeficiency in the French budget as correct, it is clear that the 'true\r\nRepublicans' have mulcted France since 1879 in the round sum of five\r\nmilliards of francs--or, in other words, of a second German War\r\nIndemnity!\r\n\r\nBut a banker of eminence, thoroughly familiar with the French finances,\r\ntells me that M. Leroy-Beaulieu has underestimated the amount. He puts\r\nit himself at an annual average for the past decade of 700,000,000\r\nfrancs. Thanks to the device adopted, I am sorry to say, by M. Léon Say,\r\nin 1879, of transferring to what is called the 'extraordinary budget' of\r\neach year numerous items which should properly find a place in the\r\n'ordinary budget' of each year, it is not very easy to get at a precise\r\nand definite basis for estimating the real amount of these annual\r\ndeficiencies.\r\n\r\nM. Amagat, a Republican deputy for the Department of the Cantal, who has\r\ndistinguished himself and earned the hostility of the Carnot Government\r\nby his cool and methodical treatment of these financial matters,\r\ndenounces this device as 'deplorable,' and as keeping alive the most\r\nstrange 'illusions' among well-meaning French Republicans about the real\r\ncondition of the national finances.\r\n\r\nPrecisely! But the device was adopted expressly to keep alive these\r\n'illusions,' in order that the 'illusions' might keep alive the\r\npoliticians who adopted the device.\r\n\r\nIt served M. Léon Say, who knew better, in 1879. It serves M. Rouvier,\r\nwho, perhaps, does not know better, in 1890. The new Chamber met on\r\nNovember 12, 1889. A fortnight had hardly passed when M. Rouvier, as\r\nMinister of the Finances, the 'Minister of ill-omen' as M. Amagat calls\r\nhim, rose in his place and, without a blush, affirmed that the budget\r\nfor 1889 showed an excess of receipts over expenditure of 'forty\r\nmillions of francs!' This bold statement was promptly telegraphed from\r\nParis, by the correspondents of the foreign press in that city, to the\r\nfour corners of the globe. What did it mean? It meant simply this: that,\r\nthanks to the financial success of the Government investment of the\r\npublic money in a grand raree show at Paris, called a 'Universal\r\nExposition,' such an excess of income over outlay appeared in what is\r\ncalled the 'ordinary budget.' As to the 'extraordinary' budget--oh! that\r\nis quite another matter.\r\n\r\nIt is as if an English householder should divide his yearly accounts\r\ninto 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary' accounts, putting under the\r\n'ordinary' accounts his cab and railway fares, his club expenses, his\r\ntransactions on the turf, and his ventures at Monte Carlo, but remitting\r\nto the 'extraordinary' accounts such unconsidered trifles as house-rent,\r\ndomestic expenses, the bills of tailors and milliners, and taxes, local\r\nand imperial. For 1879, for example, M. Léon Say, as Finance Minister,\r\ngave in his 'ordinary' budget at 2,714,672,014 francs, which showed a\r\nreduction of 78,705,790 francs from the 'ordinary' budget of 1878; but\r\nwith this cheerful statement M. Léon Say gave in also his\r\n'extraordinary' budget at 460,674,566 francs, the whole of which rather\r\nimportant sum was to be raised, not out of the revenue, but by a loan!\r\n\r\nThis system has been carried on ever since 1877, when the 'true\r\nRepublicans' got possession of the legislature, two years before they\r\nput M. Grévy into the Elysée as President.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1882, M. Daynaud, an authority on questions of finance,\r\nsummed up the results in a speech delivered in the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nThe Government in 1877 spent, in round numbers, 3,177,000,000 francs. In\r\n1883 it spent 4,040,000,000 francs. All this without including what are\r\ncalled 'supplementary credits.' So that, putting these aside, it appears\r\nfrom the speech of M. Daynaud that, in seven years, between 1877 and\r\n1883, the 'true Republicans' subjected the people of France to an\r\nincrease of no less than 863,000,000 francs in their annual public\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile these same 'true Republicans,' who were thus adding hundreds\r\nof millions yearly to the public debt, struck hundreds of thousands out\r\nof the lawful income of the clergy of France. They ordered the\r\ndispersion by Executive decrees, and 'if necessary by military force,'\r\nof all religious orders and communities not 'authorised' by the\r\nGovernment. They drove nuns and Sisters of Charity, with violence and\r\ninsult, out of their abodes. They expelled the religious nurses from the\r\nhospitals and the priests from the prisons and the almshouses. They\r\n'laicised' the schools of France, throwing every symbol of religion--in\r\nmany cases literally--into the street, forbidding, literally, the name\r\nof God to be mentioned within the walls of a school, and striking out\r\nevery allusion to the Christian faith from the text-books supplied at\r\nthe cost of the Christian parents of France to their children in the\r\nschools supported out of taxes paid by themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is simply impossible to overstate the virulence and the violence of\r\nthis official Republican war against religion which began under the\r\nWaddington Ministry almost as soon as it took possession of the\r\ngovernment in 1879. It was formally opened under the leadership of M.\r\nFerry. M. Ferry is admitted to be the ideal statesman of the Opportunist\r\nRepublicans now in power. To him M. Carnot owes his Presidency of the\r\nRepublic. In March 1879 M. Jules Ferry asked the Republican majority of\r\nthe House to pass a law concerning the 'higher education,' in the draft\r\nof which he had inserted a clause ever since famous as 'Article 7,'\r\ndepriving any Frenchman who might be a member of any religious\r\ncorporation 'not recognised by the State' of the right to teach. This\r\n'Article 7' was a revival of an amendment offered to but not carried by\r\nthe Legislative Assembly of the Second Republic in 1849. The principle\r\nof it is as old as the Emperor Julian, who forbade Christians to teach\r\nin the schools of the Empire.\r\n\r\nM. Ferry's law was intended to repeal a previous law adopted in 1875,\r\nand which had not been then three years in operation. By the Law of July\r\n12, 1875, the Republic of Thiers and Macmahon had modified, in the\r\ninterest of liberty, the monopoly of higher education in France enjoyed\r\nby the State. It was an essentially wise, liberal, and 'progressive'\r\nlaw. But the Republicans of Gambetta could not endure it, for it gave\r\nthe Christians of France the right to provide for the higher education\r\nof their children in their own way; so it must be abolished.\r\n\r\nIt was abolished; and though the Senate, making a partial stand for law\r\nand for the equal rights of French citizens, struck out 'Article 7,' M.\r\nFerry and his friends, who controlled the President, caused him to issue\r\nan Executive decree, to which I have already referred, breaking up the\r\nreligious orders aimed at in 'Article 7.' This was in 1880. In 1882 the\r\nChamber adopted a law proposed by M. Paul Bert, confirming to the State\r\nthe monopoly of secondary education; and to-day we see M. Clémenceau,\r\nthe avowed enemy of M. Jules Ferry and of the Opportunists, shaking\r\nhands with them in public, after the elections of 1889, on this one\r\nquestion of deadly hostility to all religion in the educational\r\nestablishments of France. At a banquet given on December 3 by certain\r\nanti-Boulangist students in Paris to the Government deputies for the\r\nSeine, M. Clémenceau declared himself in favour of 'the union of all\r\nRepublicans'--upon what lines and to what end?--'To prepare the Grand\r\nSocial Revolution and make war upon the theocratic spirit which seeks to\r\nreduce the human mind to slavery!'\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Third Republic is to combine the Socialism of 1848\r\nwith the Atheism of 1793, the National workshops with the worship of\r\nReason, and to join hands, I suppose, with the extemporised 'Republic of\r\nBrazil' in a grand propaganda which shall secure the abolition, not\r\nonly of all the thrones in Europe, but of all the altars in America. If\r\nlanguage means anything and facts have any force, this is the inevitable\r\nprogramme of the French Republic of 1890, and this is the entertainment\r\nto which the Christian nations of the New World and the Old were invited\r\nat Paris in the great 'centennial' year 1889.\r\n\r\nBelieving this to be the inevitable programme of the Republic, as\r\nrepresented by the Government of President Grévy so long ago as 1880, I\r\nwas yet surprised, as 1 have said, to see the strength of the protest\r\nrecorded against it by the voters of France at the Legislative elections\r\nin 1885, because the Republic of Thiers and Macmahon had made, and\r\ndeservedly, so much progress in the confidence of the French people,\r\nthat I had hardly expected to see the essentially conservative heart of\r\nFrance startled, even by three or four years' experience of the\r\nGovernment of M. Grévy, into an adequate sense of the perils into which\r\nthese successors of the Maréchal-Duc were leading the country.\r\n\r\n'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' is an essentially French\r\nproverb. Seven years of peace, liberty, and financial prosperity under\r\nthe Conservative Republic should have gone far, I thought, to convince\r\nthe average French peasant that he might, after all, be safe under a\r\nrepublic. Doubtless this impression of mine was not wholly unfounded.\r\nYet, in spite of this important check upon the headway of the reaction\r\nagainst Republicanism provoked by the fanaticism and the financial\r\nextravagance of the Government of President Grévy--and in spite, too, of\r\nthe open official pressure put upon the voters of France by the then\r\nMinister of the Interior, M. Allain-Targé, who issued a circular\r\ncommanding all the prefects in France to stand 'neutral' between\r\nRepublican candidates of all shades, but to exert themselves for the\r\ndefeat of all 'reactionary' candidates; in spite of all this, the\r\nelections of October and November 1885 sent up about two hundred\r\nmonarchical members, whose seats could by no trick or device be stolen\r\nfrom them, to the Chamber of Deputies, and pitted a popular vote of\r\n3,608,578 declared enemies of the existing Republic against a popular\r\nvote of 4,377,063 citizens anxious to maintain or willing to submit to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to the present day the Government of the Third French\r\nRepublic has been standing on the defensive. It has steadily lost\r\nground, with every passing year, in the confidence and respect of the\r\nFrench people. The financial scandals, amid which President Grévy and\r\nhis son-in-law, M. Wilson, disappeared and President Carnot was\r\n'invented,' simply revealed a condition of things inherent in the very\r\nnature of the political organisation of France under the parliamentary\r\nrevolutionists who came into power in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe Third French Republic, such as these men have made it, is condemned,\r\nhopelessly and irretrievably condemned, by its creed to be a government\r\nof persecution and by its machinery to be a government of corruption.\r\nThere is no escape for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt has made the Government of France--not the Administration, but the\r\nform, the constitution of the Government--a party question, and it has\r\norganised the party which insists that France shall be a Republic,\r\nopenly and avowedly upon the maxim of Danton that 'to the victors belong\r\nthe spoils.' What has come of this maxim in the United States, where the\r\nform and constitution of the Republic are accepted by all political\r\nparties, and the administration of the Government alone is a party\r\nquestion, I need not say.\r\n\r\nThere are 'black points' even on the horizon of the American Republic,\r\nas all Americans know. But there is no point blacker than this, as to\r\nwhich, however, it is possible with us that good men of all political\r\nparties may act together in the future as they have acted together in\r\nthe past for Civil Service Reform. But what is possible with us is not\r\npossible with the party of the Republic in France. For, by making the\r\nRepublic a republic of religious persecution, the Republicans of the\r\nRepublic of Gambetta, Jules Ferry, Carnot, and Clémenceau have made it\r\nnecessarily a republic of political proscription, and political\r\nproscription inevitably means political corruption.\r\n\r\nIf any man needs to learn this, let him study the story of the\r\nestablishment of the Protestant Succession in England by Walpole, and\r\nthe story of the overthrow of the United States Bank by President\r\nJackson, in America. He may think the Protestant Succession in England,\r\nand the overthrow of the United States Bank in America, worth the price\r\npaid for each. But he will learn at least what the price was.\r\n\r\nIt will not be the fault of the Carnot Government--certainly not of the\r\nmost energetic member of that Government, M. Constans, Minister of the\r\nInterior--if the French people fail to learn this.\r\n\r\nA very much higher price will have to be paid for the extirpation of\r\nreligion out of France, and the education of the French people into what\r\nM. Jules Ferry fantastically supposes to be 'Herbert Spencer's' gospel,\r\nidentifying duty with self-indulgence!\r\n\r\nThe late Chamber, doubtless having the then impending elections in view,\r\nvoted to abolish the Secret Service Fund of the Ministry of the\r\nInterior. It was a Platonic vote, referring only to the Budget of 1890,\r\nnor did it take effect. But on December 14, 1889, M. Constans, having\r\nmade the re-establishment of this fund a cabinet question, got up in the\r\nChamber and boldly declared that he wanted a Secret Service Fund of\r\n1,600,000 fr., or about 64,000_l._ sterling; that he did not care what\r\nthe Right thought about such a fund; that he meant to use it to 'combat\r\nconspiracies against the Republic,' and that he expected the majority to\r\ngive it to him as a mark of their personal confidence.\r\n\r\nThat the War Office, in a country like France, should need a Secret\r\nService Fund, is intelligible. It is intelligible that a Secret Service\r\nFund should be legitimately required, perhaps, by the Foreign Office of\r\na country like France. But why should a Secret Service Fund of more than\r\n60,000_l._ sterling be required by the Home Secretary of a French\r\nRepublic which is supposed to be 'a government of the people, by the\r\npeople, for the people'?\r\n\r\nI have an impression, which it will require evidence to remove, that no\r\nsuch Secret Service Fund as this is at the disposal of the Chancellor of\r\nthe German Empire; and I find the whole expense of the Home Office of\r\nthe monarchy of Great Britain set down at less than half the amount\r\nwhich, after a brief debate, the Republicans of the new Chamber in\r\nFrance, by a majority of a hundred votes, quietly put under the control\r\nof the French Home Secretary, to show their 'confidence' in the\r\nexcellent man to whose unhesitating manipulation, through his prefects,\r\nof the votes cast in September and October last, so many of them are\r\nuniversally believed in France to be really indebted for their seats!\r\n\r\nIn the year 1889 the British budget shows an outlay on the Home Office\r\nof 29,963_l._\r\n\r\nMore than this, the 'Secret Service Fund' voted out of the pockets of\r\nthe taxpayers of France into the strong box of the Minister of the\r\nInterior, considerably exceeds the cost of the British Treasury Office!\r\nIn 1888 the British budget gave the First Lord of the Treasury, to cover\r\nthe expenses of that great and important department of the British\r\nmonarchical government, 60,222_l._, or nearly 4,000_l._ less than the\r\nRepublicans of the Third French Republic have generously put at the\r\ndisposal of M. Constans to 'combat conspiracies' against the life of a\r\nRepublic of which in the same breath we are asked to believe that it has\r\njust been acclaimed with enthusiasm by the masses of the French people,\r\nas the fixed, final, and permanent government of their deliberate\r\nchoice!\r\n\r\nAt this rate it will actually cost the taxpayers of Republican France\r\nmore than two-thirds as much merely to keep the Republic from being\r\nsuddenly done to death some fine day between breakfast and dinner, as\r\nit costs the taxpayers of Great Britain to keep up the state and dignity\r\nof the British sovereign from year to year! The total annual amount, I\r\nfind, of the Civil List of Great Britain annually voted to the Queen, of\r\nthe annual grants to other members of the Royal Family, and of the\r\nViceroyalty of Ireland is 557,000_l._ Of this amount the Hereditary\r\nRevenues, surrendered to the nation, cover 464,000_l._ This leaves an\r\nannual charge upon the taxpayers of 93,000_l._ sterling, or only\r\n29,000_l._ more than the sum deliberately voted by the Republican\r\nChamber at Paris into the hands of M. Constans to be by him used in\r\n'combating conspiracies' against the Republic!--or, in other words and\r\nin plain English, in making things comfortable for his political\r\nfriends, and uncomfortable for his political enemies!\r\n\r\nAnd this, observe, is a mere supplementary adjunct to the budget of this\r\nenergetic and admirable minister, that budget having been fixed by the\r\nlate Chamber for 1890 at 61,291,256 francs--or, in round numbers,\r\n2,451,650_l._ sterling--of which handsome amount 13,059,570 francs, or\r\n522,383_l._ sterling, being the outlay on the Central Administration and\r\nthe préfectures, must be added to the 1,200,000 francs, or 48,000_l._\r\nsterling, of the Presidential salary and allowances, in order to give us\r\na basis for a fair approximate comparison of the cost to republican\r\nFrance of her executive President and prefects with the cost to\r\nmonarchical Great Britain of her executive Sovereign, lords-lieutenant,\r\nand Viceroy of Ireland. Stated in round numbers, the result appears to\r\nbe that for their republican President and their eighty-three republican\r\nprefects, the taxpayers of France pay annually out of their own pockets\r\n570,383_l._ against 93,000_l._ paid annually out of their own pockets by\r\nthe taxpayers of Great Britain for their monarchical sovereign,\r\neighty-six lords-lieutenant, a Viceroy of Ireland, and thirty-two\r\nlieutenants of the Irish counties. From the point of view of the\r\ntaxpayers, this would seem to lend some colour to Lord Beaconsfield's\r\ncontention, that economy is to be found on the side of the system which\r\nrewards certain kinds of public service by 'public distinction conferred\r\nby the fountain of honour.'\r\n\r\nThe threadbare witticism about the Bourbons of 1815, who had learned\r\nnothing and forgotten nothing, may well be furbished up for the benefit\r\nof the Republicans who now control the Third French Republic. However\r\ntrue it may, or may not, have been of the Comte de Provence and the\r\nComte d'Artois, Henri IV., who was certainly a Bourbon of the Bourbons,\r\nhad a quick wit at learning, and upon occasion also a neat knack of\r\nforgetting. He thought Paris well worth a mass, heard the mass, and got\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary for the Republicans of the Third Republic, after\r\nthe formidable lesson which France read them at the elections in 1885,\r\nto hear mass themselves. They were perfectly free to persist and to\r\nperish in their unbelief, and, like the hero of Sir Alfred Lyall's 'Land\r\nof Regrets,'\r\n\r\n  'Get damned in their commonplace way.'\r\n\r\nAll that Christian France asked of them in 1885 was that they would\r\nleave their fellow-citizens as free to hear mass as they themselves\r\nwere free not to hear it. They had only to let the religion of the\r\nFrench people alone, to respect the consciences and the civil liberty of\r\ntheir countrymen, and the tides that were rising against them, and the\r\nRepublic because of them, must inevitably have begun to subside.\r\n\r\nThe hostility between the Church and the Republic in France is\r\nabsolutely, in its origin, one-sided. The Church is no more necessarily\r\nhostile to the Republic as a Republic in France, than it is to the\r\nRepublic as a Republic in the United States or in Chile, or in Catholic\r\nSwitzerland. The Church can be made hostile to a Republic by persecution\r\nand attack just as it can he made hostile in the same way to a monarchy.\r\nNeither Philippe le Bel nor Henry the Eighth was much of a Republican.\r\n\r\nBut the Republicans of the Third Republic, in 1885, would learn nothing\r\nand forget nothing. They met the protest of millions of voters in France\r\nwith a renewed virulence of Anti-Catholic and of Anti-Christian\r\nlegislation, with an increased public expenditure, and with fresh\r\npolitical proscriptions.\r\n\r\nTheir purpose and their programme were succinctly and clearly summed up\r\nin the explicit declaration of M. Brisson, one of the most conspicuous\r\nleaders of the Republican party, that 'the Republic should be\r\nestablished in France, if necessary, by arms!'\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference in principle between such a declaration as this\r\nand the attempt of the third Napoleon to establish an empire in Mexico\r\nby arms? In the one case we have a proselytising, atheistic Republic\r\nbent on abolishing the religion of an unquestionable majority of the\r\nFrench people; in the other, we have a proselytising emperor bent on\r\norganizing empire in Mexico. In the light of the doctrine that\r\ngovernments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,\r\nthe one undertaking is as monstrous as the other. The undertaking of the\r\nEmperor failed disastrously in Mexico; I do not believe, and for many\r\nreasons, that the undertaking of the Republic will succeed in France.\r\n\r\nOne, and the chief of these reasons, is, that I believe the hold of the\r\nChristian religion upon the body of the French people to be stronger,\r\nand not weaker, than it was before the propaganda of atheism began. In\r\nsome of the chapters of this volume evidence, I think, will be found to\r\nshow this. Under the plan which I have adopted in constructing the book,\r\nI have not attempted to marshal and co-ordinate the evidence. I have\r\nsimply presented it, where it presented itself, either in conversations\r\nhad by me at one or another place with persons qualified, as I thought,\r\nto speak with some authority, or in observations made by me in passing\r\nthrough one or another region. It was a part of my plan too, as I have\r\nsaid, to register, under the general heading of one or another\r\ndepartment, not only what struck me most while visiting that department\r\nin the way of things seen or heard there, but also such conversations\r\nbearing on general subjects as I there had, and such notes as I there\r\nmade from the books bearing on French history, which I took with me\r\nwherever I went. As this book is not a treatise but a record, as it is\r\nnot intended to maintain a preconceived thesis, but simply to indicate\r\nthe grounds on which I have myself come to certain conclusions and\r\nconvictions, I thought the method I have adopted the fairest, both to my\r\nreaders and to myself, that I could pursue.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nBut as the point I have now touched, of the religious condition of\r\nFrance, is a specially grave and important point, I must ask my readers\r\nto pause with me upon it for a moment here in this Introduction. I am\r\nespecially moved to do this because I have reason to think that very\r\nserious and very extraordinary delusions on this point exist outside of\r\nFrance, and especially in England. This is not unnatural when we\r\nremember that nine foreigners in ten take their impressions of France as\r\na nation, not only from the current journalism and literature of Paris\r\nalone, but from a very limited range of the current literature and\r\njournalism even of Paris. Most Americans certainly, and I am inclined to\r\nthink most Englishmen, who visit Paris, and see and know a good deal of\r\nParis, are really in a condition of penumbral darkness as to the true\r\nsocial, religious, and intellectual life of the vast majority of the\r\npopulation even of Paris. We see the Paris of the boulevards, the\r\nChamps-Elysées, the first nights at the theatres, the restaurants, and\r\nthe fashionable shops; the _Tout Paris_ of the gossips of the press,\r\nrepresenting, possibly, one per cent. of the population of the French\r\ncapital! Of the domestic, busy, permanent Paris, which keeps the French\r\ncapital alive from year to year and from generation to generation--the\r\nParis of industry and of commerce, of the churches, of the charities, of\r\nthe schools, of the convents--how much do we see? There are a number of\r\nprosperous foreign colonies living in London now, most of whose leading\r\nmembers maintain business or social relations, more or less active, with\r\none or another section of the English population of the great British\r\nmetropolis. Perhaps, if we could get a plain, unvarnished account from\r\nsome member of one of these colonies, of England and English life as\r\nthey appear to him and to his compatriots, Englishmen might be as much\r\nconfounded as I have known very intelligent and well-informed Frenchmen\r\nto be, by the notions of French life and of the condition of the French\r\npeople, really and seriously entertained, not by casual foreign\r\ntourists, but by highly educated foreigners who really wished to know\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\nNot long after the Legislative Elections of 1885, the results of which\r\nastonished public men in England at the time as much almost as they did\r\nthe satellites of the Government in Paris, I met at the house of a\r\nfriend in London a very eminent English public man, whose name I do not\r\nfeel quite at liberty to mention, but who is certainly regarded by great\r\nnumbers of Englishmen as an authority without appeal, not only in regard\r\nto questions of English domestic policy, but in regard to European\r\naffairs in general. In the course of a general conversation--there were\r\nten or twelve well-known people in the company--this distinguished\r\npublic man expressed to me his great surprise at the importance which I\r\n'seemed to attach to the religious sentiment in France.'\r\n\r\nI assured him that I not only 'seemed' to attach, but did in fact attach\r\nvery serious importance to it, and I ventured to ask him why this should\r\n'surprise' him.\r\n\r\nTo this he replied textually--for I noted down the remark afterwards\r\nthat evening--that he was 'under the impression that the religious\r\nsentiment was dead in France!'\r\n\r\n'May I ask,' I replied, 'what can possibly have given you such an\r\nimpression as this?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, many things,' he answered with great emphasis, 'but particularly a\r\nstatement which I saw in a statistical work of much authority, not very\r\nlong ago, to the effect that there are in France _five millions of\r\nprofessed atheists_!'\r\n\r\nAll who heard this amazing assertion were, I think, as completely taken\r\naback by it as I was. Courtesy required that I should beg the\r\ndistinguished man who made it to give me, if he could, the title of the\r\nwork in which he had found it. This he promptly replied that he was at\r\nthe moment unable to do. He, however, very nearly asphyxiated a very\r\nquiet and well-bred young Frenchman attached to the French Embassy in\r\nLondon, who was present, by appealing to him on the subject. 'No, no!'\r\nexclaimed the alarmed _attaché_, 'I dare say there is such a book, no\r\ndoubt--no doubt--but I have never heard of it.'\r\n\r\nI have never been able to find this valuable work. When I do find it I\r\nshall institute a careful inquiry into the reasons which could have led\r\nfive millions of French persons, or about one-seventh of the whole\r\npopulation of France, to take the pains to register themselves as\r\n'atheists.' Presumably they must all have been adults, as the\r\ndeclaration, on such a subject, of infants, would scarcely, I take it,\r\nbe collected, even by M. Jules Ferry, as evidence of the success of his\r\ngreat scheme for 'laicising' religion out of France.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I find it set down in the usual statistical authorities\r\naccessible in 1884, that out of the 36,102,021 inhabitants of France,\r\n35,387,703 registered themselves, or were registered, as Catholics,\r\n580,707 as Protestants, 40,439 as Israelites, and 81,951 as 'not\r\nprofessing any form of religion.'\r\n\r\nYet I suppose that, if the eminent public man who saw, as in a vision,\r\nthese five millions of registered atheists marching to the assault of\r\nChristianity in France were to announce their existence as a fact to a\r\nlarge public meeting in some great English provincial city to-morrow, we\r\nshould have leaders in some of the English journals a day or two\r\nafterwards prognosticating the immediately impending downfall of all\r\nreligion in France. Our modern democracies on both sides of the Atlantic\r\nhave made such rapid and remarkable progress of late years in the art of\r\nforming opinions, that if Isaac Taylor could come back to the earth he\r\nleft, not so very long ago, he would hardly, I think, recognise the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nThe fashion of taking it for granted that the whole world is fast going\r\nover to the gospel of ganglia and bathybius, of _vox populi et præterea\r\nnihil_, is not confined to the 'fanatics of impiety' in France. I have\r\nheard it seriously stated in a London drawing-room by another public man\r\nof repute within the last year, that he believed 'Mr. John Bright and\r\nMr. Gladstone were the last two men who would ever cite the Christian\r\nScriptures as an authority in the House of Commons.'\r\n\r\nThe uncommonly good English of the Christian Scriptures may perhaps\r\nconstitute an objection to their free use in addressing popular\r\npolitical assemblies. But, admitting this, I hesitate to accept the\r\nstatement. That it should have been made however, and made by a man of\r\nmore than ordinary ability, is perhaps a thing to be noted.\r\n\r\nBut I revert to France.\r\n\r\nAs the time drew near for the Legislative elections of 1889, the\r\nRepublicans in power began to perceive that their methods had not been\r\ncrowned with absolute success. The awkward corner caused by the enforced\r\nresignation of President Grévy had indeed been turned, because the\r\nConstitution of the Third Republic provides for the election of the\r\nPresident by the Assembly. But it is one thing to play a successful\r\ncomedy in the Assembly with the help of what in America is called 'the\r\ncohesive power of the public plunder,' and quite another thing to get a\r\nsatisfactory Chamber of Deputies re-elected by the people of France\r\nafter four years of irritating and exasperating misrule. Much was\r\nexpected from the dazzling effect upon the popular mind of the Universal\r\nExposition at Paris--so much, indeed, that I have had the obvious\r\nincongruity of selecting for the celebration of the French Revolution by\r\na French Republic the centennial of a year in which no French Republic\r\nexisted, accounted for to me by a French Republican on the express\r\nground that the legislative elections were fixed for 1889! There may\r\nhave been some truth in this. For nothing could be more preposterous\r\nthan the pretext alleged for the selection by the French Government.\r\n\r\nThis or that thing which occurred at a particular time in a particular\r\nyear may reasonably be made the occasion of a centennial or a\r\nsemi-centennial celebration. But how is anybody to fix and celebrate the\r\n'centennial' of a set of notions called 'the principles of 1789'?\r\n\r\nIn the United States we have celebrated the 'Centennial' of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and the Centennial of the first\r\nInauguration of the first President.\r\n\r\nDid the French Government intend to invite the monarchies of Europe to\r\ncelebrate the destruction by a mob of the Bastille on July 14, 1789?\r\nHardly, I suppose! Or the Convocation of the States-General at\r\nVersailles on May 5, 1789? Certainly not--for the States-General were\r\nconvoked, not under the 'principles of 1789,' but in conformity with an\r\nancient usage and custom of the French monarchy.\r\n\r\nWhat are the 'principles of 1789'?\r\n\r\nAnd why should anybody in or out of France celebrate them?\r\n\r\nIf by 'the principles of 1789' we are to understand the principles of\r\nmodern constitutional government--and I know no other intelligible\r\ninterpretation of the phrase--there is certainly no reason why anybody\r\nout of France should particularly concern himself with celebrating the\r\nadoption of these principles in France any more than with celebrating\r\nthe adoption of them in England, or the United States, or Germany, or\r\nSpain, or Italy. The principles of modern constitutional government were\r\ncertainly not intelligently adopted, and certainly not loyally carried\r\nout in France, by any of the governments which tumbled over one another\r\nin rapid succession in that distracted country between 1789 and 1815.\r\nHave they been intelligently adopted and loyally carried out in that\r\ndistracted country to-day? That is a question, I think, not hastily to\r\nbe answered!\r\n\r\nTo ask the people of England, of the United States, of Germany, of\r\nSpain, of Italy, to unite in celebrating the principles of modern\r\nconstitutional government, under the name of the 'principles of 1789,'\r\nat Paris, as if the world were indebted to Paris or to France for the\r\ndiscovery, and the promulgation, and the adoption of those principles,\r\nwas really a piece of presumption which might have been pardoned to the\r\nfatuity of the Abbé Sieyès a hundred years ago, but was hardly to have\r\nbeen expected from educated Frenchmen in the year 1889.\r\n\r\nThis was stated, with great good sense and commendable courtesy towards\r\nthe French Government responsible for the absurdity, by the Italian\r\nPremier, Signor Crispi, in the Chamber of Deputies at Borne, on June 25,\r\n1887.\r\n\r\nIn reply to an interpellation of Signor Cavalotti, addressed to the then\r\nForeign Minister of Italy, Signor Depretis, as to the intentions of the\r\nItalian Government with regard to the Universal Exposition of 1889 at\r\nParis, Signor Crispi, then Minister of the Interior, made a striking\r\nspeech (Signor Depretis being then ill of the disease of which he\r\neventually died), in which he lucidly and forcibly gave the reasons of\r\nthe Italian Government for declining to take any official part in the\r\nmatter. He plainly intimated his conviction (which is the conviction, by\r\nthe way, of a great many sensible people not premiers of Italy) that the\r\nbusiness of Universal Expositions has been possibly overdone. But,\r\nwithout dwelling upon that point, he went on to show that it would be\r\nfoolish for Italy to isolate herself from the other great powers by\r\ntaking an official part in this particular 'Universal Exposition.' To\r\nthe plea of Signor Cavalotti that liberated Italy ought to unite with\r\nFrance to celebrate 'the principles of 1789,' Signor Crispi thus\r\nreplied; 'I agree with the honourable member that we are sons of 1789.\r\nBut I must remind him that 1789 was preceded by the glorious English\r\nRevolution, and by the great American Revolution, in both of which had\r\nbeen manifested and established the principles which have subsequently\r\nprevailed throughout the world.'\r\n\r\nWhether the treatment of the Sovereign Pontiff at Rome by the government\r\nof United Italy, since 1871, has been entirely consistent with the\r\nprinciples of the 'glorious English Revolution,' or of the 'great\r\nAmerican. Revolution,' I need not now consider. But that all the living\r\npolitical doctrines of which intelligent Frenchmen mean to speak when\r\nthey talk about the 'principles of 1789' are the American political\r\ndoctrines of 1776, and the English political doctrines of 1688, admits\r\nof no question. As to this, Signor Crispi was absolutely right, and it\r\nis creditable to him, as an Italian statesman and an Italian patriot,\r\nthat he should have thus early and publicly declined to attach the\r\nliberty and the independence of Italy as a bob to the tail of an\r\nelectioneering Exposition kite at Paris in 1889. To France and to the\r\nFrench Republics--first, second, and third--Italy owes a good deal less\r\nthan nothing. To two rulers of France, both of them of Italian blood,\r\nthe first and third Napoleon, she owes a great deal. But her chief\r\npolitical creditor, and her greatest statesman, Cavour, drew his\r\npolitical doctrines, not from the muddy French pool of the 'principles\r\nof 1789,' but from the original fountains of 1776 and 1688. Had Cavour\r\nbeen living in 1887, to answer the interpellation of Signor Cavalotti,\r\nhe might, perhaps, have defined more sharply than it was given to Signor\r\nCrispi to do, the real relations between the French Revolution of 1789\r\nand the national developments of modern Italy. Had the French Revolution\r\nof 1789 been left to exhaust itself within the limits of France, it\r\nwould probably have ended--as the friends of the misguided Duc d'Orléans\r\nalmost from the first expected to see it end--in the substitution of a\r\ncomparatively capable for a positively incapable French king upon a\r\nconstitutional French throne. In that event it would have interested\r\nEurope and the world no less, and no more, than the Fronde or the\r\nreligious wars which came to a close with the coronation of Henry of\r\nNavarre. It was the fear of this, unquestionably, which drove the\r\nconspirators of the Gironde into forcing a foreign war upon their\r\nunfortunate country. The legend of Republican France marching as one man\r\nto the Rhine to liberate enslaved Europe has much less foundation in\r\nfact than the legend of Itsatsou and the horn of Roland. It is a pity\r\nto disturb historical fables which have flowered into immortal verse,\r\nbut really there was not the slightest occasion, so far as Europe was\r\nconcerned, for France in 1790 to 'stamp her strong foot and swear she\r\nwould be free.' M. de Bourgoing's admirable diplomatic history of those\r\ndays makes this quite clear. No power in Europe objected to her being as\r\nfree as she liked. On the contrary, England, even in 1792, was both\r\nready and anxious to recognise the insane French republic of that day,\r\nand to see the French royal family sent away to Naples or to Madrid.\r\n\r\nPitt was too far-sighted a statesman not to be well aware that the\r\ncommerce and the colonies of such a French republic were the natural\r\nprizes of English common sense and English enterprise. Nor was Austria\r\nindisposed to see the House of Bourbon, which had successfully disputed\r\nthe supremacy of Europe with the Hapsburgs, humiliated and cast down.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution became Titanic only when it ceased to be a\r\nRevolution and ceased to be French. The magnificent stanzas of Barbier\r\ntell the true story of the riderless steed re-bitted, re-bridled, and\r\nmounted by the Italian master of mankind, the Cæsar for whom the\r\neagle-eyed Catherine of Russia had so quietly waited and looked when the\r\nhelpless and hopeless orgie of 1789 began. The Past from which he\r\nemerged, the Future which he evoked, both loom larger than human in the\r\nshadow of that colossal figure. What a silly tinkle, as of pastoral\r\nbells in some Rousseau's _Devin du Village_, have the 'principles of\r\n1789,' when the stage rings again with the stern accents of the\r\nconqueror, hectoring the senators of the free and imperial city of\r\nAugsburg, for example, on his way to Wagram and to victory twenty years\r\nafterwards!\r\n\r\n'Your bankers are the channel through which the gold of the eternal\r\nenemy of the Continent finds its way to Austria. I have made up my mind\r\nthat I will give you to some king. To whom I have not yet settled. I\r\nwill attend to that when I come back from Vienna.'\r\n\r\nAnd, as the faithful record of the _Drei Mohren_ tells us, 'Messieurs\r\nthe senators withdrew, much mortified, and not at all pleased.'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the conqueror kept his word, and having made a king\r\nof Bavaria to give them to, gave them to the king of Bavaria, Messieurs\r\nthe senators, with a suppleness and a docility which would have done\r\ncredit to Debry (who after proposing, as a republican, to organise 1,200\r\n'tyrannicides' and murder all the kings and emperors of the earth,\r\nbegged Napoleon to make him a baron), made haste to come and prostrate\r\nthemselves before the new Bavarian Majesty and to protest that until the\r\nfortunate day of his arrival to reign over them they had never known\r\nwhat real happiness was.\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing more certain than another in human history, it is\r\nthat but for the English Revolution of 1688 and the American Revolution\r\nof 1776 the world in general would know and care to-day very little more\r\nabout the French 'principles of 1789,' and the French Revolution, and\r\nthe First French Republic, than the world in general knows or cares\r\nto-day about the wars in the Cevennes or the long conflict between the\r\nArmagnacs and the Bourguignons.\r\n\r\nNapoleon crumpled up the 'principles of 1789' and the Revolution and the\r\nRepublic in his iron hand, and flung them all together into a corner. He\r\nmeant that France and the world should think of other things. In 1810\r\nPaganel, who, having been a 'patriot' of the Convention, had naturally\r\nbecome a liveried servant of the Emperor and King, thought he might\r\nventure to compose a 'Historical Essay on the French Revolution.' He\r\ndedicated it to the Imperial Chancellor of the Legion of Honour, and he\r\nwound up his preface with these words: 'And thus at last we see without\r\nastonishment, after this long series of errors, misfortunes, and crimes,\r\nthe Republic disappear, and France implore the Supreme Being to\r\nvouchsafe to her the one great and potent genius who in these difficult\r\ncircumstances was able to lift her up, to defend her, and to govern\r\nher!' The heart of Louis XVIII. would have been touched by the grateful\r\nhumility of this repentant wretch. But the Emperor simply kicked him\r\ndownstairs. He forbade the book to be published. The whole edition was\r\nput under lock and key, and never saw the light till liberty came back\r\nto France, with the white nag and the Bourbon lilies, in 1815. Surely\r\nhere is a fact worth noting!\r\n\r\nHad this first history of the French Revolution, written as Paganel, a\r\nmember of the Revolutionary Convention, wrote it, been published under\r\nthe First Republic, the author would infallibly have been sent to the\r\nguillotine. Writing it under the First Empire he was merely snubbed,\r\ndespite his fulsome adulation of the Emperor. His book was finally given\r\nto the world under the restored historic monarchy in 1818!\r\n\r\nIn 1811, Chateaubriand, having been elected to succeed Marie-Joseph\r\nChéniér, the brother of the republican poet André, murdered by the First\r\nRepublic, as a member of the Institute, prepared a speech on the\r\nConvention, to be read before that august body. Napoleon heard of it\r\nand, without troubling himself to look at it, forbade it to be\r\ndelivered. 'It is well for M. de Chateaubriand,' he said, 'that it was\r\nsuppressed. If he had read it before the Institute, I would have flung\r\nhim into the bottom of a dungeon, and left him there the rest of his\r\nnatural life!'\r\n\r\nNapoleon knew the First Republic thoroughly. He had measured all its\r\nmen, and all its records were in his hand. He could not get into or out\r\nof his carriage without treading on some incorruptible 'patriot'\r\nprostrate between its wheels with a petition for a préfecture, a title\r\nor a pension. The crimes and follies of the First Republic had made\r\nFrance and the world sick of its name. Its true story was a tale of\r\nshame and humiliation, not fit to be dragged out into the blaze of the\r\nglory of Imperial France.\r\n\r\nThe First Republic was the deadly enemy both of liberty and of law. The\r\nconduct of its first envoy to the United States would have justified\r\nWashington in locking him up. When a stop was put to his mischievous\r\nimpertinences, he preferred exile in America to the chance of the\r\nguillotine at Paris, and his name died out, I believe, curiously enough,\r\nwith one of the chief instruments of the notorious Tweed Ring in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe first shots fired in anger under the American flag after the peace\r\nof 1783 were fired against cruisers of the French Republic captured in\r\nthe West Indies by American men-of-war, to put an end to the ignorant\r\nand insolent attempt of what called itself a government at Paris to\r\nissue letters of marque on American soil against English commerce.\r\n\r\nSo grateful was France to the Emperor for restoring the reign of law,\r\nthat she never troubled herself about liberty, and but for the\r\nindomitable defence of constitutional liberty and national independence\r\nwhich England maintained, often single-handed, from the rupture of the\r\npeace of Amiens to the victory of Waterloo, the very names of the chief\r\nactors in the odious and ridiculous dramas of the Revolution would have\r\nlong since faded, as Napoleon intended they should fade, out of the\r\nmemory of the masses of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nHow little confidence the Government of the Third Republic really felt\r\nin the efficacy of the 'principles of 1789,' and of the 'Centennial\r\nExposition,' to save it at the polls in 1889 from the natural\r\nconsequences of its intolerance and its corruption, was instructively\r\nshown by the absolute panic into which it was thrown by the election at\r\nParis of General Boulanger on January 27. Here, at the very threshold of\r\nthe great electoral year, rose the spectre of the 'man on horseback'!\r\n\r\nCertainly General Boulanger was not Napoleon Bonaparte. The Government,\r\nwhich had itself put General Boulanger on horseback, knew the strength\r\nand the weakness of the man himself. But it was the legend, not the\r\nman, they dreaded. If the French people, or even if Paris, really\r\nbelieved in the legend of Boulanger--and this tremendous vote of January\r\n27 looked very much like it--it mattered little what the real value of\r\nthe man might be, the legend would make him master of France. That would\r\nmean for the Third Republic the fate of the First Republic and of the\r\nSecond, and for the men who had identified it with their own fanaticism\r\nand folly, and greed, and incapacity, a long farewell to all their\r\ngreatness!\r\n\r\nAs for the eventual results, what mattered these to them?\r\n\r\nThe Universal Exposition might collapse, or it might be opened by\r\nGeneral Boulanger on his black horse, instead of President Carnot in his\r\nlandau. What did that signify? But it signified much that the men who\r\nhad invented President Carnot were not likely to make part of the\r\n_cortège_ of General Boulanger.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that from January 27, 1889, the Government\r\nof the Third French Republic was openly and visibly given up by night\r\nand by day to one great purpose alone--and that purpose was, not to\r\nglorify the 'principles of 1789,' not to celebrate the Republic--the\r\ngrand statue of the Triumph of the Republic, destined to be set up with\r\ngreat pomp in the sight of the assembled human race, was actually left\r\nto be cast in plaster of Paris, no functionary caring to waste a sou on\r\nputting it into perennial bronze or enduring marble--no! the great\r\ndominant, unconcealed purpose of all the leaders of the Republic was, in\r\nsome way--no matter how, by hook or by crook--to conjure that spectre\r\nof the First Consulate, riding about, awful and imminent, on the black\r\nhorse of General Boulanger!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the high-water mark of this quite unparalleled and most\r\ninstructive panic was the appearance, towards the end of the last\r\nparliamentary session, of M. Jules Ferry, the author of the odious\r\n'Article 7,' the man who after hesitating--to his credit be it\r\nsaid--originally to propose that ministers of religion should be\r\nabsolutely forbidden to teach the children of France in her public\r\nschools, at last succumbed to the vehemence of Paul Bert, the Condorcet\r\nof this modern persecution, and became the acknowledged leader of the\r\nwar against Liberty and Religion--in the tribune of the Deputies, there\r\nto urge, and indeed to implore, the Conservative members to make peace\r\nwith the persecutors, and save them from the peril of Boulanger!\r\n\r\nThe scene of that day in the Chamber of Deputies was not one to be\r\nforgotten. The aspect and the accents of the Republican leader were at\r\ntimes absolutely pathetic with the pathos of unaffected terror. It was\r\ndifficult to believe, whilst listening to him, that he could really have\r\n'five millions of professed atheists' at his back, encouraging him to\r\nextirpate Christianity, root and branch, out of the land of France!\r\n\r\nNot less striking, in quite another sense, was the grim and stony\r\nsilence with which the appeal of the Republican leader was received by\r\nthe Right, representing, as the Third Republic has chosen to make the\r\nRight represent, the Religion, and with the Religion the Liberty, of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIt reminded me, I am sorry to say, of the way in which a naturally\r\namiable and considerate householder might be expected to listen to the\r\narguments of an adroit and accomplished burglar showing cause why he\r\nshould be locked into the plate-closet to protect him from the police.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Ferry's offer was to suspend the application to certain\r\nreligious bodies of the interdict fulminated against them by himself and\r\nthe Republican Government. At last he paused, evidently oppressed by the\r\nsteady, unresponsive gaze of his hearers.\r\n\r\nThen the silence was broken!\r\n\r\n'Do you speak for the Government?' called out a fiery deputy of the\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Ferry hesitated a moment and then replied, 'No! I speak for\r\nmyself; but there are many who think as I do!'\r\n\r\n'You!' came back the hot response. 'You! bah!--you are nothing!'\r\n\r\nThe real response came later, on September 22, when, in his own town of\r\nSt.-Dié, the chief of the Opportunists, despite all the efforts of the\r\nprefect of the department and of the local authorities to carry him\r\nthrough, was beaten by a Monarchist. Obviously M. Ferry had heard how\r\nthings looked from his committee at St.-Dié when he made his fruitless\r\nappeal to the Eight in the Chamber!\r\n\r\nFinding that nothing was to be expected from any cajolery of the Right,\r\nor any transactions with the outraged and awakened Christianity of\r\nFrance, the Government at last gave up the control of the impending\r\nelections unreservedly into the hands of M. Constans of Toulouse, of\r\nwhom I have already spoken. To him, as Minister of the Interior, all\r\nthe machinery of politics was abandoned. Every prefect in France became\r\nan electoral agent to do his bidding.\r\n\r\nFor the first time too, I believe, even in French administrative\r\nhistory, all the employees of the post-offices and the telegraph offices\r\nwere transferred from the control of the Director of Posts and\r\nTelegraphs to the direct control of the Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nUnder his control they still remain, and it is now proposed to attach\r\nthese services permanently to the Ministry which manages the elections.\r\nCan anybody fail to see what this means?\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of M. Constans, too, the Government resolved to attack\r\nthe spectre. It determined to drive General Boulanger out of France. It\r\nis not easy to feel much sympathy with General Boulanger, who while\r\nMinister of War put into execution against the Comte de Paris and his\r\nfamily a most iniquitous decree, exiling them--for no other cause than\r\nthe fact that they come of the family which made France a nation--from\r\ntheir country and their homes. But the proceedings which the Government\r\nof President Carnot took against General Boulanger were of such a\r\ncharacter that the Procureur de la République, who was first directed to\r\ncarry them out, withdrew from his post. Before they could be consummated\r\nby the arrest of General Boulanger, he suddenly left France. Into the\r\nsubsequent action of the Senate, constituted as a 'High Court of\r\nJustice' to try him, I need not here enter.\r\n\r\nSuffice it that after a canvass organized in this fashion and in this\r\nspirit, and prosecuted by the Government with remorseless energy, the\r\nelections held on September 22 and October 6 have left the relative\r\nstrength of the Government and of the Opposition in the new Chamber\r\nsubstantially what it was in the Chamber of 1885. This, in the\r\ncircumstances, can only be described, in the language of one of the\r\nablest Republican journalists in Paris, M. Jules Dietz of the _Journal\r\ndes Débats_, as 'an escape from a disaster.'\r\n\r\nThe repulse of the assailants at the Redan did not save Sebastopol for\r\nthe Russians. The margin of the proclaimed majorities by which many of\r\nthe Government members of the new Chamber were returned, is so very\r\nsmall as to suggest of itself the pressure, in a very practical and\r\nconcrete form, of the hand of authority on the returns at the polls. In\r\ntwenty cases these majorities ranged from 6 to 200 votes.\r\n\r\nIn one case, in the Seine Inférieure, the details of which were given to\r\nme by persons of the highest character, with perfect liberty to use\r\ntheir names, the Government member was declared by the prefect, after\r\ntwo adjournments of the counting, to have been returned by a majority of\r\n173 votes on a total poll, which proved upon examination to very\r\nconsiderably exceed the total number of voters registered in the\r\ndistrict!\r\n\r\nBut, taking the general return of the votes cast at these elections as\r\nauthentic, it is perfectly plain that the Monarchical party in France is\r\nstronger to-day than it was in 1885, and that the Republican party is\r\nweaker in France to-day than it was in 1885.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the strength of the two parties stood as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Republicans of all shades                   4,377,063\r\n  Conservatives and Monarchists               3,608,578\r\n                                              _________\r\n  Republican majority                           768,485\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the strength of the two parties stands as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Conservative Monarchists                    3,144,978\r\n  Boulangists                                   629,955\r\n                                              _________\r\n                                              3,774,933\r\n\r\n  Opportunist Republicans                     2,980,540\r\n  Radicals                                      981,809\r\n  Socialists                                     90,593\r\n                                              _________\r\n                                              4,052,542\r\n\r\n  Republican majority                           277,609\r\n\r\nHere at once we see a falling off in the Republican majority, between\r\n1885 and 1889, of no less than 490,876 votes. This is certainly\r\nsignificant enough when we remember that in 1885 the Monarchists did not\r\neverywhere and openly attack the Republic as a form of government, while\r\nin 1889 the issue was admitted on both sides to involve the existence of\r\nthe Republic as a form of government.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the total of the votes cast in 1885 and 1889, we find a\r\ndiminution of no fewer than 788,821 votes. If this proves anything, it\r\nproves that the voters of France care very much less about the stability\r\nof the Republic in 1889 than they did in 1885. And this farther appears\r\nfrom the further fact that the falling off in the total of votes cast\r\naffected the Republican vote of 1889 much more seriously than it\r\naffected the Monarchical vote. Indeed it did not affect the Monarchical\r\nvote at all. On the contrary, while there was a positive falling off\r\nfrom the Republican vote of 324,521 between 1885 and 1889, there was a\r\npositive increase of the Monarchical vote, between 1885 and 1889, of\r\n166,355.\r\n\r\nHow is it possible to weigh the meaning of these figures fairly without\r\nseeing that a form of government which exists in France only in virtue\r\nof a majority which a change of 140,000 votes in a total poll of\r\n7,827,475 would have turned into a minority, can hardly be said to rest\r\nupon as firm a basis, for example, as that of the Third Empire, with its\r\nplebiscitary majority of seven millions in 1870 responding to its\r\nmajority of seven millions in 1852?\r\n\r\nTake away from the narrow Republican majority of 1889 the public\r\nfunctionaries, high and low, now counted in France by tens of thousands,\r\nwith all who depend upon and are connected with them; give to the ballot\r\nin France the sanctity, freedom, and security which it has in England;\r\ncompel the public authorities in France to abstain, as they are\r\ncompelled in England to abstain, from direct interference with the\r\nexercise by the voters of the right of suffrage, and the evidence is\r\noverwhelming which goes to show that the Third Republic would be voted\r\ninto limbo to-morrow!\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTo say this is to say that the Third Republic does not exist in France\r\nby the will of the French people; and this I believe to be absolutely\r\ntrue. The Third Republic exists by virtue of the control which its\r\npartisans have acquired of the administrative machinery of the\r\nGovernment, or, in other words, by virtue of political corruption and\r\nintimidation. So great has been the multiplication of functionaries\r\ngreat and small under the Third Republic, that it is not easy to get at\r\nan accurate estimate of their numbers. The best information I have been\r\nable to obtain leads me to believe that, exclusive of the military and\r\nnaval forces, not less than two hundred thousand adult French citizens\r\nnow draw their subsistence from the public treasury. This represents a\r\npopulation of at least a million of souls, so that we have nearly one in\r\nthirty of the inhabitants of France subjected to a direct or indirect\r\npecuniary pressure from the central authorities at Paris. So openly is\r\nthis pressure exerted under the Third Republic, that the Government of\r\nM. Carnot did not hesitate, during the Universal Exposition, and not\r\nlong before the Legislative Elections began, to bring up no fewer than\r\nsome thirteen thousand of the mayors of France to Paris at the public\r\nexpense. There they were entertained--still at the public expense--with\r\na sumptuous hospitality, which proves that, however orthodox the\r\nRepublican Atheism may be of M. Constans, the Minister of the Interior,\r\nhe has not yet struck the blessed St. Julian out of his calendar, at\r\nleast when he is spending the money of the French taxpayers on his\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nIf I may believe what I afterwards heard in more than one provincial\r\ntown, these worthy mayors (every one of whom, let me observe, exercises\r\na direct personal and official authority over the elections) carried\r\nback to his astonished and envious fellow-citizens tales of Arabian,\r\nTunisian, Algerian, and Annamite nights at the Exposition, and on the\r\nChamps-Elysées, to which no pen but that of Diderot or of the younger\r\nCrébillon could do adequate justice. 'I do not believe the Sultan,' said\r\na clever and amusing lady to me at Toulouse, 'threw open the doors of\r\nParadise so wide to the German Kaiser, at Constantinople, as did our\r\nmore than liberal M. Constans to the married Mayors of France at Paris!'\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, at Honfleur, in the Calvados, it came to my knowledge\r\nthat the local authorities, on the morning of the first Legislative\r\nElections, brought over from another port on the Norman coast, a number\r\nof sailors, residents of Honfleur, and entitled to vote there, but\r\nabsent in the pursuit of their calling. These honest Jack Tars came to\r\nHonfleur by the railway, in a kind of brigade, accompanied by a\r\nGovernment agent, who marched them up to the polls, and, having seen\r\ntheir votes safely deposited for the Government candidate, gave each man\r\nhis return ticket for the next day, and set them all free to spend the\r\ninterval in the bosom of their astonished and, I hope, delighted\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the domestic peace of France, this proceeding\r\nwas perhaps less reprehensible than the Belshazzar's Feast of M.\r\nConstans and the thirteen thousand mayors. But from the point of view of\r\nthe relations between the Third Republic and the deliberate independent\r\nelectoral will of France, I think it must be admitted that they are, as\r\nthe people say in the Western States of America, 'very much of a\r\nmuchness!'\r\n\r\nI ought to add that in France the mayors of the chief towns (or\r\n_chefs-lieux_), the arrondissements, and the cantons are nominated by\r\nthe Government at Paris. The mayors of the communes which owe their\r\ncorporate freedom to the monarchy are elected, but the Third Republic\r\nhas taken from them the control of their local taxation for purposes of\r\nthe highest local interest. I should say also that all the sailors in\r\nFrance are obliged to be inscribed upon lists kept and controlled by the\r\nmaritime prefects for the Ministry of the Marine, so that their\r\nwhereabouts may be known or ascertainable at all times.\r\n\r\nAmericans who understand the institutions of their own country find the\r\ntrue measure of the fitness of a people for self-government in their\r\nrespect for the authority of a lawful Executive. The fatal mistake has\r\nbeen made by the Third as it was by the First French Republic of\r\nconfounding respect for a lawful Executive with submission to an\r\nExecutive controlled by a majority of the Legislature. The fact that the\r\npower of the public purse, in a constitutional government, is\r\nnecessarily confided to the Legislature, makes this mistake fatal--fatal\r\nat once to the liberty of the taxpayers who supply the public purse, and\r\nof whom the members of the Legislature are simply the agents and\r\ntrustees, and to the efficiency and integrity of the Executive. I see\r\nwith much interest, while the sheets of this book are going through the\r\npress in London, that this very grave point emerges from a brief\r\ncorrespondence published in the English newspapers between the\r\nChancellor of the British Exchequer, Mr. Goschen, and Lord Lewisham.\r\nLord Lewisham, acting, it would appear, on behalf of a number of English\r\nCivil Servants, wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer concerning\r\ncertain complaints of these servants, embodied in a memorial. In his\r\nreply, the Chancellor of the Exchequer alludes to an intimation which\r\nseems to have been made by the authors of this memorial of their\r\nintention to put a kind of pressure upon the Minister of the Crown\r\nthrough the House of Commons. Upon this Mr. Goschen observes: 'the\r\nmemorialists should be reminded that their reference to an appeal to\r\ntheir representatives in Parliament, involving, as it would seem, a\r\npersonal parliamentary canvass to determine the relations between the\r\nState and its employés, contemplates a course of action not only\r\ninjurious to the public interests, but opposed to the best traditions of\r\nthe Civil Service.'\r\n\r\nWhat the English Chancellor of the Exchequer here most wisely and\r\nproperly condemns as a mischief a-brewing, has become the _jus et norma_\r\nof 'the relations between the State and its employés' in France under\r\nthe Third Republic.\r\n\r\nThe persons charged to execute and enforce the laws in France have come,\r\nunder the Third Republic, from the President downwards throughout the\r\nCivil Service, to regard themselves, and to be regarded by the people,\r\nas the mere servants and instruments of the persons deputed by the\r\npeople to consider what the laws shall be, and to adjust the public\r\ntaxation to the necessities of the public service. The result\r\nnecessarily is that the majority of the French Chamber of Deputies under\r\nthe Third Republic has visibly become an irresponsible oligarchy of a\r\nkind most dangerous to liberty and the public weal.\r\n\r\nBy calling themselves, as they do, the 'party of the appeal to the\r\npeople,' the French Imperialists show their doubtless well-founded\r\nconviction that the masses of the French people are essentially\r\nmonarchical in their ideas as to the best tenure by which the Executive\r\nauthority can be held. To believe this, is to believe that the masses of\r\nthe French people are essentially lovers of order, not of disorder; that\r\nthey instinctively put the executive above the legislative function in\r\ntheir conceptions of a political hierarchy, and therefore that they are\r\nessentially fitted for self-government. In this I am sure the\r\nImperialists are right. But, unfortunately for them, the centralised\r\nadministrative machinery of government in France by which the French\r\npeople are now and have for a century past been prevented from governing\r\nthemselves, though not indeed of Imperial origin, was so developed and\r\nperfected by the genius of the first Napoleon as to become identified in\r\na sense with the Napoleonic dynasty.\r\n\r\nIt is a great misfortune of the French people that all great changes in\r\ntheir political system, no matter how promoted or in what spirit, must\r\nbe wrought out within the vicious circle of this centralized\r\nadministrative machinery. The initiative in liberating France from this\r\ncentralized administrative machinery can only come from within the\r\nvicious circle itself. An independent Executive of France made Chief of\r\nthe State by the popular will, and protected, as the Executive of Great\r\nBritain is protected, in the interest of liberty and of the people, by\r\nthe hereditary principle, might take this initiative and begin the great\r\nwork of so distributing throughout France the administrative\r\nresponsibilities and powers now concentrated at Paris as to make the\r\nFrench people for the first time really their own masters.\r\n\r\nCertainly no executive holding power by any tenure less independent and\r\nsecure can ever effect this. That a real basis exists upon which this\r\ngreat work might be carried out in the local life, traditions, ideas and\r\nsympathies by which the widely different populations of what used to be\r\nknown as the different provinces of the Kingdom of France are united\r\namong themselves and discriminated from one another, many able and\r\nwell-informed Frenchmen believe. One of the most hasty and mischievous\r\nthings done by the infatuated political tinkers of 1790 was to cut and\r\ncarve up France into arbitrary political departments for the express\r\npurpose of disintegrating and destroying those ancient social and\r\npolitical organisms.\r\n\r\nThis purpose has not been effectually accomplished. What has been\r\naccomplished is to superpose upon the ancient organic France another\r\narbitrary and administrative France. This latter arbitrary and\r\nadministrative France controlled by a legislative oligarchy, which first\r\nmakes and then uses the French Executive for its own purposes, it is\r\nwhich now calls itself the Third French Republic.\r\n\r\nThe traits and the tendencies as well as the origin of the Third\r\nRepublic can be thoroughly studied at Paris. Without Paris the Third\r\nRepublic never could have existed. It exists now in virtue of the\r\npolitical machinery of which Paris is the centre. That it could not\r\nwithstand for a day any severe shock given to that machinery was\r\nconfessed, as I have said, by its own government in the abject panic\r\nwhich followed the victory of General Boulanger at the polls of the\r\ncapital on January 27, 1889.\r\n\r\nThe traits and the tendencies of France, on the contrary, must be\r\nstudied in the provinces. There was always more wit than wisdom in the\r\nfamous saying of Heine--that to talk about the opinion of the provinces\r\nin France was like talking about the opinion of a man's legs--the head\r\nbeing the seat of thought, and Paris being the head. But the saying was\r\nuttered during the reign of Louis Philippe, and long before the\r\nestablishment of universal suffrage by the Second Empire. With universal\r\nsuffrage and with the development during the past twenty years of the\r\nrailway and of the telegraphic system throughout France, the importance\r\nof the provinces relatively to Paris has greatly and steadily increased.\r\nWhile steam and electricity have, of course, increased the strength of\r\nthe pressure which an aggressive oligarchy controlling the centralised\r\nadministrative machinery of the Government at Paris can put upon the\r\nopinions and the interests of France, they have also, it must be\r\nremembered, increased the power of France to resist and to resent that\r\npressure. They have established return currents, the force of which\r\ngrows visibly greater every year. The great provincial towns and cities\r\nof France, for example, are ceasing to be dependent, as they formerly\r\nwere, upon the press of Paris for their news and views of which passes\r\nin the capital.\r\n\r\nThere are no such journals yet in any of the French provinces as the\r\npowerful newspapers which are to be found throughout the United Kingdom;\r\nbut there is a steady and very notable growth in the circulation of the\r\nmore important local journals, and the telegraph brings them the news of\r\nthe day from Paris long before the Parisian papers can reach their\r\nreaders. The development of these influences has been checked, and is\r\nstill checked, by the official control at Paris of the telegraphic\r\nsystem, and it is worth noting here that, just before the legislative\r\nelections, the Minister of the Interior, to whom the control of the post\r\noffice and of the telegraphs had been transferred, caused the telephone\r\noffices throughout France to be taken possession of by the officials of\r\nthe Government, though the negotiations with the private companies\r\nowning the telephones for the purchase of them were still incomplete,\r\nand though the private owners formally protested against the act.\r\n\r\nBut though the Government may check and retard, it cannot prevent the\r\ndevelopment of these influences. France, such as I have found it, full\r\nof activity, full of energy, leavened with a genuine leaven of religious\r\nfaith, irritated by a persistent mockery of the forms of liberty into\r\nprizing and demanding the realities of liberty, must grow steadily\r\nstronger. The Republic condemned to a policy of persecution and of\r\nfinancial profligacy must grow steadily weaker.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to develop France, or letting France develop herself\r\ninto a republic, the partisans of a Republic have invented successive\r\nrepublics, each more grotesque and uncomfortable than its predecessor,\r\nand insisted on cramming France into them. So far the republics have\r\ngone to pieces and France has survived. So intense is her vitality, so\r\ntough appears to me to be the old traditional fibre in many parts of the\r\nFrench body politic, that before the great chapter of the _Gesta Dei per\r\nFrancos_ can be safely assumed to be finally closed, a good many more\r\nmilliards will have to be spent on that State Establishment of\r\nIrreligion and Disestablishment of God which the 'true Republicans' of\r\nthe Third Republic call 'laicisation.' Long before those milliards can\r\nbe raised and spent, the Third Republic will come to the bottom I\r\nbelieve, if not of the purse, certainly of the patience, of the French\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt is already admitted on all hands that so slight a thing as the\r\nreappearance of General Boulanger at Paris on September 21, 1889, would\r\nhave completely reversed the general result of the elections of the next\r\nday. The birthday of the First Republic would have been celebrated by\r\nthe funeral of the Third. The failure of General Boulanger then to\r\nreappear may have made an end of General Boulanger, but it certainly did\r\nnot establish the Republic.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, here as we see is the Minister of the Interior, who\r\nknows the situation better than any of his colleagues, invalidating\r\nelection after election in the Chamber of Deputies, and beginning the\r\nwork of financial reform by demanding an enormous Secret Service Fund to\r\nprotect the Republic against conspirators!\r\n\r\nSooner or later this tragi-comedy must end. It concerns Europe and the\r\nworld that it should end sooner rather than later, and that it should\r\nend with a pacific restoration of France to her proper place in the\r\nfamily of European States. Surely the most imperious necessity of the\r\nimmediate future in Europe is a general disarmament. No French Republic\r\ncan possibly propose or accept such a disarmament. No French Empire even\r\ncould easily propose or accept such a disarmament. For the Republic and\r\nthe Empire are jointly though not equally responsible for the\r\nhumiliations and the disasters of the great Franco-German War. The\r\nhistoric French monarchy, restored through a revision of the existing\r\nConstitution by the deliberate will of the French people, might propose\r\nsuch a disarmament with a moral certainty that it would be accepted.\r\nWould not England necessarily stand by France in such a proposal? And is\r\nit not clear that the refusal of Central Europe to accept such a\r\ndisarmament so proposed and supported would make that alliance with the\r\nRussian Empire, which is impossible to a French republic, both easy and\r\nnatural with a French monarchy?\r\n\r\nI should have visited France to small purpose if I could suppose that\r\nsuch considerations as this will much affect the masses of the French\r\npeople. Their present Minister of Public Instruction, M. Fallières, gave\r\nhis measure of their average enlightenment on such points when he\r\nactually called upon the electors of the Lot-et-Garonne in September to\r\nvote against M. Cornelis Henry de Witt because a monarchical restoration\r\nwould 'be followed by a revival of the _droits des Seigneurs_, and--by a\r\nCossack invasion!'\r\n\r\nBut there are many men in France alive to such considerations as this,\r\nand these men have many ways of reaching and influencing the political\r\naction of the masses of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nSuch men see the vital relations of the diplomatic position of France to\r\nthe grave domestic question of the public expenses. It is difficult to\r\nascertain the actual cost of the military establishment of France on its\r\npresent footing of an armed peace. But French officers of rank assure me\r\nthat France is now keeping under arms at least 550,000 men, or more than\r\none in seven of her adult male population available for national\r\ndefence. 'We have more men under arms than Germany,' said a French\r\ngeneral to me at Marseilles, 'which is absurd, because the German army\r\nfor fighting purposes, in case of any sudden trouble with us, includes\r\nthe armies of Austria, Hungary and Italy--so Germany saves money on her\r\npeace footing which we idly expend on ours.' What this officer did not\r\nsay to me has been said by many other well-informed Frenchmen, that the\r\nrecent military legislation of the parliamentary majority is\r\ndemoralising this great military force and threatens its efficiency. The\r\nprominent position taken in the new Chamber since it assembled by M.\r\nRaynal, a Radical member for the Gironde who held the portfolio of\r\nPublic Works under M. Gambetta in 1880 and again under M. Jules Ferry,\r\nis not of good omen for the army. It was M. Raynal who brought about the\r\nfall of General Gresley as Minister of War by an 'interpellation,'\r\nfounded on the refusal of the War Minister to remove an officer of the\r\nTerritorial Army because he was a monarchist. And now M. Raynal appears\r\nwith a project for more effectually establishing the domination of the\r\nparliamentary majority by giving it the right to adjourn once a week for\r\nsix successive weeks, all debates on any 'interpellation' to which the\r\nGovernment may object on 'grounds of public policy!'\r\n\r\nWhile the costly army of France is at the mercy of legislation under\r\nsuch conditions, the navy of France is managed, as appears from a\r\ndrastic report presented some time ago by M. Gerville-Réache, an able\r\nRepublican deputy from Guadeloupe, with at least as much regard to\r\npolitics as to economy. M. Gerville-Réache showed that contracts were\r\ngiven out so recklessly that a supply of canned provisions, for example,\r\nhad been laid in at Cherbourg sufficient for five years! At other\r\nstations supplies of all kinds were bought at prices ranging far above\r\nthe market rates, and circulars were produced in which successive\r\nMinisters of Marine had ordered the commandants at different naval\r\nstations to 'expend every sou in their possession' on no matter what,\r\n'before the expiration of the fiscal year, as any excess remaining in\r\ntheir hands would not only be lost to the Ministry by being ordered back\r\ninto the Treasury, but would allow opportunities for impugning the\r\nforecast and judgment of the ministers!' Under such a system it is not\r\nsurprising that Admiral Krantz, one of the best naval administrators\r\nFrance possesses, should have been forced to withdraw from the Tirard\r\nGovernment to satisfy a political Under-Secretary, M. Etienne.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that in the actual condition of France and of Europe such\r\na system as this should last?\r\n\r\nIf France drifts or is driven into a great European war, one of two\r\nthings would seem to be inevitable. If the French armies are victorious,\r\nthe general who commands them and restores the military prestige of\r\nFrance will be the master of the government and of the country. If the\r\nFrench armies are defeated, the Government will disappear in a whirlwind\r\nof national rage and despair. 'In that event,' said a Republican Senator\r\nto me, 'in that event--which I will not contemplate--the princes of the\r\nHouse of France would be recalled instantly and by acclamation; we\r\nshould have nothing left but that or anarchy.'\r\n\r\nBut putting aside the crisis of a great war, what other alternatives\r\npresent themselves as the possible issues in peace of the system now\r\ndominant at Paris?\r\n\r\nOf what weight or avail in the policy of the parliamentary oligarchy\r\nwhich calls itself the Third Republic are the counsels of men like M.\r\nLéon Renault, M. Jules Simon, M. Ribot, M. Léon Say, who have tried in\r\nvain to constitute in France the Conservative Republic of M. Thiers? M.\r\nLéon Say left his seat in the Senate before the recent elections and\r\npresented himself in the Pyrenees as a candidate for the Chamber, with\r\nthe well-understood expectation of finding himself eventually put into\r\nthe presidency of that body. This was to be a guarantee of the\r\nConservative Republic!\r\n\r\nWho actually fills that most important post?\r\n\r\nM. Floquet, who first distinguished himself under the Empire by publicly\r\ninsulting the Emperor of Russia in the Palais de Justice during the\r\nvisit of that potentate to Paris, and who resigned his seat as a deputy\r\nfor the Seine in March 1871 to share 'the perils and sufferings,' as he\r\nput it, of his constituents, the Communards of Paris! For this M.\r\nFloquet was arrested at Biarritz and locked up at Paris till the end of\r\nthe year 1871.\r\n\r\nHow can France hope to find liberty within her own borders, or peace\r\nwith honour abroad, under the domination of such men?\r\n\r\nOn December 19, 1888, during a discussion of the budget of 1890 in the\r\nFrench Senate, M. Challemel-Lacour, a Republican of the Republicans, who\r\nactually allowed the red flag to be hoisted instead of the tricolour on\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville of Lyons while he was prefect of the Rhône, and who\r\nrepresented the Republic for a time as Ambassador in London, made a\r\nremarkable speech, in which he warned his colleagues of the fate which\r\nthey were preparing for the Republic. He is one of the three Senators of\r\nthe Bouches-du-Rhône, and one of the four Vice-Presidents of a body now\r\ncontrolled by the Government, and therefore virtually by the majority of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies. He is more than this. An elaborate speech of\r\nhis, delivered in the Assembly on September 4, 1874, in which he denied\r\nthe 'right to teach' as threatening the 'moral unity of France,' was\r\nthe signal of the deliberate war against all religion afterwards\r\nproclaimed by M. Gambetta, and since prosecuted by M. Jules Ferry. Out\r\nof that speech grew the policy of the Third Republic. Yet what did he\r\nsay in 1888? He plainly declared his belief that the policy of the\r\nGovernment was driving the Republic headlong to its ruin. He spoke as a\r\nRepublican, passionately reaffirming his faith in the Republic, and his\r\ndesire to see it solidly founded in France. 'I conjure you, therefore,'\r\nhe said, 'to take order, that the Republic may once more become the\r\nreign of law; that all may be protected in their persons, in their\r\nproperty, in their faith, not only against disorder in the streets, but\r\nagainst moral disorder, moral anarchy, defamation, calumny, against the\r\nfury of an unbridled, uncontrolled, irresponsible press. It is time to\r\narrest the threatening ruin which must affect the humblest lives, if our\r\nsad fate be to witness the catastrophe of liberty!'\r\n\r\nM. Challemel-Lacour is an orator. The Senate was shaken and roused by\r\nhis earnest appeal. A motion was made that his speech be ordered to be\r\nprinted and posted on the walls of Paris. But the night came, and with\r\nthe night the pressure of the powers indicted by the speech, and so no\r\nmore was heard of it, and the budget of 1890 was voted by the outgoing\r\nChamber, and the incoming Chamber has re-established in it a Secret\r\nService Fund of 1,600,000 francs for the Minister of the Interior--and\r\nthe work of 'invalidating' the elections of troublesome deputies goes\r\nmerrily on, and in the remote valleys and hills of France poor village\r\ncurates are mulcted of half their humble stipends for the offence of\r\ncalling upon their parishioners to vote for the candidates who do not\r\nattack their religion.\r\n\r\nFrom this intolerable position there are two obvious ways of escape. One\r\nis the familiar Parisian way of the barricades. That way is not likely\r\nto be tried in the interest of liberty or of law. The other is the way\r\nwhich France sought to adopt in the recent elections, of a deliberate\r\nRevision of the Constitution, now hopelessly perverted into the\r\ninstrument of a parliamentary oligarchy. The actual Government has just\r\nprevented a Revision in the interest of a Republican Dictator, which\r\nafter all must have been more or less a leap in the dark out of a\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nAs between the only available window and the only available doorway of a\r\ndwelling in flames, it is intelligible that an emotional inmate, with\r\nthe smell of the fire on his garments, should make for the window. But,\r\nthe window being barred, what should restrain him from walking\r\nrationally out of the doorway? Any one of a dozen possible emergencies\r\nmay compel a Revision of the Constitution--and any Revision of the\r\nConstitution now must mean either a Radical revolution, or a restoration\r\nof the hereditary Executive. Either of these would be a doorway; for\r\nFrance would know whither either of these must lead. M. Thiers, it is\r\nsaid by persons who ought to be well informed, might have led France\r\nthus out of a doorway in 1871, and into a restoration of the Monarchy.\r\nM. Thiers was an exceedingly able man, but it is hard to see how he\r\ncould then have gone about to achieve this result. France in 1871 was\r\nstill a conquered country occupied by the German armies. The Third\r\nNapoleon and his son were both then living. The Comte de Chambord was\r\nthen in the strength of his years. The Comte de Paris had not then taken\r\nthe steps which he afterwards took with so much wisdom and moral\r\ncourage, to make an end of the rupture between Henri V. and the House of\r\nOrléans.\r\n\r\nThe situation now is materially changed. The Imperialists are divided\r\nbetween Jerome the father and Victor the son. The Royalists are united.\r\nThe France of Henri IV. and of Charles X. is represented to-day by the\r\ngrandson of Louis Philippe. The _vox Dei_ and the _vox Populi_ meet in\r\nhim as they met in the Prince of Orange when England, forty years after\r\nthe criminal catastrophe of 1649, was driven by the flight of James II.\r\ninto seating William and Mary, the grandson and the granddaughter of\r\nCharles I., upon the abdicated throne.\r\n\r\nHow can an independent Executive ever be restored in France excepting in\r\nthe person of Philippe VII.? Had the Revolution of 1830 never occurred\r\nhe would now by the ancient law of succession be King of France and\r\nNavarre. Had the Revolution of 1848 never occurred he would now be King\r\nof the French under the Charter. If the era of revolutions is ever to be\r\nclosed in France, must it not be by an Executive who shall be at once\r\nKing of France and King of the French--King of France, as representing\r\nthe historic growth into greatness and unity of the French nation; King\r\nof the French, as representing the personal liberties and the private\r\nrights of every citizen of the French commonwealth?\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE AND THE REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIN THE PAS-DE-CALAIS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CALAIS\r\n\r\nThe men who, in 1790, brought about the formal division of France into\r\ndepartments, no doubt thereby facilitated the ephemeral transformation,\r\nin September 1792, of the ancient French monarchy into a French\r\nrepublic, 'one and indivisible.' But they also put their improvised\r\nrepublic thereby at the mercy of the marvellous Italian who blew its\r\nflimsy framework into shreds with his cannon in October 1795.\r\n\r\nIn working out what George Sand calls 'the great practical joke' of the\r\nFirst Consulate, and the formidable reality of the Empire, Napoleon\r\nfound, ready-fashioned to his hand and undamaged by the republican\r\ntinkers, a system of administration essentially despotic. This system\r\ndid for him what Charlemagne did for himself when he got rid of the\r\ntribal dukes of the Merovingian epoch, and, as Gneist and Sir Robert\r\nMorier have shown, gathered into his own control the four unities which\r\nmake up the unity of the State--the military, the police, the judiciary,\r\nand the finances. The counts of Charlemagne, removable at his pleasure,\r\nwith no root in their _comitatus_ save his sovereign will, were the true\r\nprototypes of the modern French prefect. If the old provinces of\r\nFrance, which had a local life, organisation, and spirit of their own,\r\nhad been taken as the units of government in 1790, the monarchy perhaps\r\nmight hardly have been abolished in 1792 by a Convention so headlong and\r\ntumultuous that for one day it actually forgot, after abolishing the\r\nmonarchy, to establish any government in its place.\r\n\r\nBut if a republic had been founded through the action of the provinces\r\nof France, it would probably have been harder for Napoleon to make an\r\nend of it, than it was for Charlemagne to dispense with the recognition\r\nof local rights to which the Merovingian kings had submitted in the\r\nappointment of their hereditary _subreguli_, from among the local\r\nmagnates of the shires. This, it seems to me, may be inferred from the\r\nfact, admitted on all hands in France, that the departments remain\r\nto-day what they were at first--mere administrative divisions which have\r\ntaken no hold on the feelings and sympathies of the people, while the\r\n'local patriotism' of the provinces is still a vivid reality.\r\n\r\nFrenchmen are still Gascons and Provençals, Bretons and Normans,\r\nBurgundians and Picards, and no country in the world is richer than\r\nFrance in local histories and chronicles. But so late as 1877 the local\r\nhistory of the Department of the Pas-de-Calais, in which I am now\r\nwriting, could be described as 'unique in France,' and this local\r\nhistory is really a history, not of the department at all, but of the\r\ntwo important and interesting provinces of which it consists--Artois,\r\nnamely, and the Boulonnais--each of which still preserves, after nearly\r\na century, its own distinctive character in the physiognomy of the\r\npeople, in their habits, their turn of mind, and their traditions. The\r\nattempt to fuse them into a new political entity has completely failed.\r\nNo more has, apparently, come of it, locally, than would have come of\r\nan attempt to fuse Massachusetts and Rhode Island into a Department of\r\nMartha's Vineyard, or Kent and Sussex into a Department of New Haven.\r\nPossibly even less. For Artois and the Boulonnais never passed\r\ndefinitely under the French crown until the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Even Calais, after the Duke of Guise had wrested it from\r\nEngland, was conquered for Spain by the Archduke Albert, and a smiling\r\nlittle agricultural commune alone now commemorates, in its name of\r\nThérouanne, the once great and flourishing episcopal capital of Morinia\r\nin which Clodion began the French monarchy, and which was mercilessly\r\nrazed to the ground and abolished from off the face of the earth, little\r\nmore than three hundred years ago, by the victorious emperor Charles the\r\nFifth.\r\n\r\nOf this artificial department Calais is neither the chief town nor\r\ncapital. It has scarcely a third of the population of Boulogne, and not\r\nmuch more than half the population of Arras, which is the seat of the\r\npréfecture; and though it is by no means so dreary and uninteresting a\r\nplace as the casual traveller, seeing only the landing-pier, and the new\r\nstation, which bears the name of the heroic Eustache de St.-Pierre, is\r\napt to take it to be, it cannot compare, in point of beauty and\r\ninterest, either with Boulogne or with Arras. But as the French head of\r\nthe great historic ferry between England and the Continent, and as the\r\nseat of sundry thriving factories, it is both a busy and prosperous\r\ntown. I found its streets swarming with people and its houses a flutter\r\nof flags and banners, when I came to it on June 3, 1889, to see the\r\n'inauguration,' by President Carnot, of the works on which the French\r\nGovernment has been spending millions of francs during the past decade,\r\nwith an eye to deepening and enlarging the harbour. The weather was\r\nmagnificent. Several men-of-war of the Channel squadron lay off the\r\nport. Excursion steamers came in from England, bringing members of\r\nParliament and miscellaneous British subjects, of the sort once\r\nindignantly denounced to me by the little old verger of a Midland\r\ncathedral as 'them terrible trippers.' The active and good-natured\r\nrailway porters at the station were worn out with throngs of travellers\r\npouring in from all the country round about. There was much animation\r\neverywhere, but nowhere any enthusiasm, though Calais, I suppose, must\r\nbe a republican town, as at the election of a deputy, held here in 1886,\r\nthe Government candidate, M. Camescasse, received 5,196 votes against\r\n2,233 given to his Conservative opponent, M. Labitte. I am told, too,\r\nthere is a good deal of Socialism among the factory workmen; and I can\r\nsee that the place is full of _cabarets_ and _débits_, flowing not only\r\nwith light beer and sour wine, but with spirits of a sort to make the\r\nconsumers more clamorous about the rights than solicitous about the\r\nduties of man.\r\n\r\nI heard, in the course of the day, that at some points in his progress,\r\nthe President was received with cries of 'Vive Boulanger!' but nothing\r\nof this sort passed under my own observation. What most struck me was\r\nthat his presence appeared to be not an event at all, but merely an\r\nincident of a general holiday. Nor did the people seem to care much\r\nabout the real event of the day, the 'inauguration' of the perfected\r\nport. Perhaps they knew that the port is not yet perfected. Those of\r\nthem who went down to the pier at least knew, this--for a steamer of no\r\nvery great size, the St.-André, I believe, trying to come in, grounded\r\non the sand, and lay there thumping herself heavily for I know not how\r\nlong. I heard this mishap described with much glee by a group of\r\nBoulonnais in the main street. 'Ah bah!' said one of them exultingly,\r\n'they may spend what they like, Calais will never be Boulogne!'\r\n\r\nI breakfasted with a friend who lives much on a property he has in\r\nPicardy, and who came down to Calais to meet me. When I first knew him,\r\nyears ago, he was a republican of the type of Cavaignac and a bitter\r\nenemy of the Empire, some of his kinsfolk in the Gironde having been\r\nill-treated during the persecution which raged against the republicans\r\nand the royalists alike, in and around Bordeaux, after the _coup d'état_\r\nof the Prince President. Of later years he has been growing indifferent\r\nto public affairs, and is now, I think, simply a pessimist, whom nothing\r\nbut a foreign invasion of France is likely to rouse into activity again.\r\n\r\n'What is the matter with the people here?' I asked him. 'Are they\r\nBoulangists, or do they simply dislike Carnot?'\r\n\r\n'No!' he replied, 'I don't think they care much about Boulanger, and why\r\nshould they dislike Carnot? There is nothing in him to like or to\r\ndislike. He is not a personality. He is only a functionary, and\r\nFrenchmen care nothing about functionaries. They know that this is an\r\nelectoral job, and they care nothing about it, one way or the other.'\r\n\r\n'But I saw an inscription on a banner in one of the streets,' I said,\r\n'to this effect: \"Calais always faithful to the Carnots!\" Does that mean\r\nthat the Carnots are of this country?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all! The grandfather of Carnot was born in Burgundy somewhere.\r\nHe married a young lady of St.-Omer, and in that way came to be sent by\r\nthe Pas-de-Calais to the \"Legislative\" and the Convention. The\r\ninscription is amusing though,' he added, 'for, like these other\r\ninscriptions reciting the names of Lazare Carnot, and Hippolyte Carnot,\r\nand Sadi Carnot, it shows how hard some people are trying to work the\r\nPresident up into a personality. They want to make him out the heir of a\r\ndynasty--Carnot III.!'\r\n\r\n'That is not a very republican way of looking at a President,' I\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n'Possibly not, but it is a very French way of looking at one! We should\r\nbe the most monarchical people in Europe if we were not the most\r\nanarchical. Give a public man a legend and a grandfather, and he can go\r\na long way with us. I don't know that the grandfather will do without\r\nthe legend, even when, as in this case, the grandfather has a legend of\r\nhis own.'\r\n\r\n'Is that legend of grandfather Carnot very strong in this region?' I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n'Neither in this region nor anywhere else,' he replied. 'I think it is\r\nvery foolish of the managers in Paris to provoke comparisons by sending\r\na political bagman to Germany to bring back the ashes of Papa Victory,\r\nas the Prince de Joinville brought back the dead Emperor from St.\r\nHelena. Carnot I., after all, was simply a good war minister, who loomed\r\ninto greatness only in comparison with the rogue Pache and the\r\nphenomenal booby Bouchotte who preceded him. He was certainly no better\r\nthan his successor Pétiet, and it was Pétiet, not he, who finally\r\n\"organised victory\" by sending Moreau to the Rhine, and Bonaparte to\r\nItaly. Napoleon, who knew them both, made Pétiet governor of Lombardy,\r\nand chose him, not Carnot, to organise the great camp at Boulogne. When\r\nPétiet died, not long after Austerlitz, Napoleon gave him a much grander\r\nfuneral in the Pantheon than can be got up now for the grandfather of\r\nCarnot. Most people have forgotten Pétiet, and it is a blunder to remind\r\nthem of him. But this is a government of blunderers. See what trouble\r\nthe Ferrys and the Freycinets are taking to unmake the legend\r\nClémenceau made for Boulanger! Do what they may, that black horse is\r\nworth more to Boulanger to-day than Carnot's grandfather ever will be to\r\nCarnot III.'\r\n\r\n'But has Carnot III. no value of his own? Has he not shown more firmness\r\nthan people expected of him when this Boulangist business began?'\r\n\r\n'Carnot III. is simply the firm-name of Ferry and De Freycinet. I am not\r\nfond of the scurrilities of Rochefort, as you know, but he sometimes\r\nhits the nail on the head very hard, as he did when, on the day after\r\nthat comedy of the presidential election, he said \"the fact that a man,\r\nif you ask him to dinner, will not put your spoons into his pocket is\r\nnot a sufficient reason for making him president of a republic.\" Only,'\r\nhe added reflectively, 'that was not quite their reason for making him\r\npresident. It was that they thought he would let other people pocket the\r\nspoons.'\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of what used to be said of Secretary Seward by his\r\nenemies, that he was 'honest enough himself, but cared nothing about\r\nhonesty in other people.'\r\n\r\n'I don't mean that exactly,' said my friend. 'What I mean is, that\r\nCarnot III. is not clever enough to know whether the people around him\r\nare or are not honest. His grandfather was. Carnot I. would have cut a\r\ngreat figure in our present Senate, and in the party of the \"sick at\r\nheart\"--the respectable gentlemen, I mean, who are always consenting,\r\nunder the stress of some \"reason of State,\" to vote for one or another\r\npiece of rascality, though it makes them \"sick at heart\" to do so.\r\nCarnot I. voted in this way for the murder of Louis XVI., and he takes\r\npains to tell us that all his colleagues in the Convention who voted for\r\nit did so in dread of the mob in the galleries. Just in the same way he\r\nwas sharp enough to join Napoleon during the Hundred Days, because he\r\nsaw that his best chance of saving his own head and staying in France\r\nwas to keep out the Bourbons. This Carnot III. is, I dare say, more\r\nhonest and less calculating--for he is certainly more dull--than his\r\ngrandfather. Perhaps he may turn out to be the Louis XVI. of the\r\nRepublic.'\r\n\r\nHow much has actually been spent on the works here to make Calais a\r\ngreat seaport, it is not easy to ascertain; but the lowest estimates\r\nstated to me seem to be quite out of proportion with the results\r\nactually achieved.\r\n\r\nMy conversation on this point with my friend from Picardy is worth\r\nrecording.\r\n\r\n'Ten years ago,' he said, 'the amount to be spent on Calais was set down\r\nat eleven millions of francs. I feel quite sure that at least twice this\r\nsum has been actually spent here since the work began in 1881.'\r\n\r\n'Why do you feel sure of this?'\r\n\r\n'Because twice the first estimate has been avowedly spent everywhere in\r\nFrance on the whole scheme. Calais alone figures this year in the budget\r\nfor sixteen millions and a half! You were in France, were you not, in\r\n1880, and you must surely remember the songs that used to be sung in the\r\nstreets:--\r\n\r\n  \"C'est Léon Say, c'est Freycinet,\r\n  C'est Freycinet, c'est Léon Say.\"\r\n\r\n'These two men, both of them men of business, both financiers (though\r\nthe \"white mouse\"[1] is a bit of a visionary) and both men of ability,\r\ndeliberately adopted, in 1879, after a single conversation with\r\nGambetta, a scheme improvised by him, who was neither a man of business\r\nnor a financier, but a declamatory Bohemian, for keeping up the war\r\nexpenditure by committing France to the creation of a complete\r\n\"commercial outfit.\"\r\n\r\n    [1] This is the popular nickname of M. de Freycinet.\r\n\r\n'The Republicans won the elections in 1877 by frightening France into a\r\nbelief that a Conservative victory at the polls would be followed by a\r\nnew German invasion. I am not sure, mind you, that this was an idle\r\nscare. For under the Conservative administration of our affairs we had\r\ncleared off in six years' time the frightful burdens imposed upon us by\r\nthe war, by the senseless Parisian revolution of 1870, and by the\r\nCommunist insurrection of 1871; and it is likely enough that Bismarck\r\nmay have made up his mind to attack us if he saw us persist in a sane\r\nand sensible public policy. Be that as it may, Gambetta, Léon Say, and\r\nFreycinet, between them, did his work for him by plunging the country\r\nback into the financial morass from which the Conservatives had rescued\r\nit. They carried the new chamber with them into Gambetta's scheme for\r\ndoing systematically and successfully what had been clumsily attempted\r\nin the Ateliers Nationaux of 1848. France was to be made a republic by\r\nspending nearly the amount of the German War indemnity on the\r\nconstruction of railways, canals, and ports all over the country. The\r\nsum stated in the outset was four thousand five hundred millions of\r\nfrancs--rather a pretty penny you must see!'\r\n\r\n'I remember it,' I replied, 'and I remember thinking, when the scheme\r\nwas first developed, that the adoption of it was a wonderful evidence of\r\nthe financial vigour and vitality of France.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you,' he replied rather bitterly. 'It was just such a proof of\r\nvigour and vitality that Dr. Sangrado used to get from his patients with\r\nhis lancet. It was a great political manoeuvre, no doubt, and it\r\ncommended itself to all the hungry politicians in France so promptly\r\nand so warmly, that within three years' time, in 1882, M. Tirard, who\r\nwas then Finance Minister, and who is now on the box of the Carnot\r\ncoach, had to admit that the expenditure then contemplated in carrying\r\nout this great idea could not possibly fall short of nine thousand one\r\nhundred and fifty millions of francs! This, observe, was seven years\r\nago. To-day it has swelled, at the least, into eleven and perhaps to\r\ntwelve thousand millions of francs. Why not? Gambetta, Léon Say, and\r\nFreycinet proclaimed the millennium of civil engineers and local\r\ncandidates. What becomes of equality and fraternity if the smallest\r\nhamlet in the recesses of the Jura is not as much entitled to a local\r\nrailway at the public expense as the largest port on the Bay of Biscay?\r\nOnce let it be understood that the Government means to spend ten\r\nthousand millions on public works, and all the voters are ready to\r\nbelieve the Government has found the philosopher's stone. Nobody but the\r\ntax-gatherer will ever make them understand where the money comes from.\r\nAnd between the tax-gatherer and the taxpayer, a truly clever finance\r\nminister can always interpose successfully, for a certain length of\r\ntime, the anodyne banker with a new form of public loan! We are the\r\nsharpest and thriftiest people alive in private affairs, and in public\r\nmatters the most absolute fly-gobblers in the whole world!'\r\n\r\nI tried to console my friend by informing him that this particular kind\r\nof political financiering is not unknown in my own country. The scheme\r\nof Gambetta appears to me to be simply a development, on a grand scale,\r\nof the 'log-rolling principle,' on which, year after year, a measure\r\nknown as the 'Rivers and Harbours Bill' is engineered, with more or less\r\nfriction, through the Congress of the United States. It is regularly\r\nand diplomatically fought over between the two houses until an agreement\r\nabout it is come to between the opposing forces, described by a recent\r\nAmerican writer as 'the plutocracy at one end and the mobocracy at the\r\nother end' of our national legislature. In short, it has now become an\r\n'institution,' and like other institutions it has its legendary hero, in\r\na western legislator who is reputed to have re-elected himself for a\r\nnumber of years by 'putting through' successive appropriations for the\r\n'improvement' of a stream which rose in an inaccessible mountain and\r\nemptied itself into an unfathomable swamp.\r\n\r\n'That is very well,' said my friend gravely, 'very well indeed, but you\r\nhave to do this thing every year, while Gambetta and Léon Say and De\r\nFreycinet committed France to it once for all and irremediably. And on\r\nwhat scale do you do this sort of thing?'\r\n\r\nI was forced to own that, upon this point, Washington so far lags\r\nshamefully in the rear of Paris. Our grandest 'log-rolling' in finance\r\nis, to the colossal operations of Gambetta, Léon Say, and De Freycinet,\r\nas is the ordinary iron lamp-post of New York to the Eiffel Tower.\r\n\r\nThe 'Rivers and Harbours Bill,' in 1886, was only saved after a\r\ndesperate struggle at the very end of the session, by a compromise over\r\nan 'ancient and fish-like' canal job in the North-West, the original\r\npromoter of which, long since passed beyond the hope, if not beyond the\r\ndesire of hydraulic improvements, audaciously baptized it with the name\r\nof Father Hennepin, one of the glories of France in the New World. And\r\nyet the amount involved in the Bill did not exceed fourteen million\r\ndollars, or a beggarly seventy million francs.\r\n\r\n'At that rate,' said my friend, 'it would take your great country more\r\nthan a century to match what we have covered in ten years. And yet you\r\nare thought an enterprising people, and, what is more to the point, your\r\ntreasury shows an annual surplus, while ours shows an annual deficit;\r\nand you have nearly twice our population, have you not, and more than\r\nten times our area of territory?\r\n\r\n'If I were to \"improve\" the roads and ponds on my property on the\r\nprinciple on which France has been \"improving\" her railway systems and\r\nher ports, I should bring up in bankruptcy. Where else can the country\r\nbring up? Nothing, so far, has saved us but the woollen stocking of the\r\npeasants. Come to my place in Picardy, and I will show you a dozen\r\nold fellows who go about dressed in blouses--who work like\r\nday-labourers--no! much better and harder than day-labourers now do.\r\nThey will never tell you what they are thinking about; they will never\r\ntell me, though we are the best of friends; but you will see what they\r\nare--close at a bargain, shrewd, devoted to their farms and families.\r\nWell, they live on a third--yes, some of them on a quarter--of their\r\nincomes; they know just where every penny they have spent on the ground\r\nfor twenty years has gone, and just what it has brought back to them,\r\nand every man of them can put his hand, if need be, on ten, twenty,\r\nthirty, forty thousand francs. That is the woollen stocking. But the\r\nmost beautiful woman in the world can only give what she has. The\r\nwoollen stocking holds no more than it holds. You can find the bottom of\r\nit if you keep on long enough--and then? And mark you, if I tell the\r\nshrewdest of these old fellows that the Government is spending ten\r\nthousand millions of francs on building railways from nowhere to\r\nnowhere, and digging ports in quicksands, what will he do? He will begin\r\nto think it is very hard that he can't get a railway built or a port\r\ndug. Do you wonder I am a pessimist?'\r\n\r\n'But if this is the way in which they look at things, why do they\r\nclamour for Boulanger?'\r\n\r\n'They don't clamour for Boulanger. That is to say the peasants, the\r\nrural people. It is in the towns--here in Calais, for example, at\r\nBoulogne, at Amiens--that they clamour for Boulanger. In the towns they\r\nread all manner of trash and listen to all manner of lies. You can get\r\nup a legend in the French towns for anybody or anything as easily to-day\r\nas in the middle ages--perhaps more easily. Look at this legend of\r\nBoulanger. It is a real legend to-day. You may be sure of that, and that\r\nis the real danger of it. The people who are fighting against it to-day\r\nare the people who made it. They wanted, they could not get on without,\r\na great man. Ferry went to pieces, as you know, in 1885. Tonkin and the\r\ndead Courbet killed him. So they invented Boulanger. They made him War\r\nMinister. They put him on his black horse. They let him drive out the\r\nprinces. Look at those five men seated there in front of that café. They\r\nare doubtless decent well-to-do shopkeepers, master mechanics--no matter\r\nwhat--I will wager you that of these five men, three believe Boulanger\r\nto be the first soldier of France, and that two of them believe the\r\nGovernment has driven him into exile to prevent the Germans from\r\ndeclaring war! That is enough to make them Boulangists.'\r\n\r\n'Then they want war with Germany?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, in this part of France I think they do. But the legend is just as\r\neffective where they do not want war with Germany. Last year I was in\r\nthe country of Grévy, not far from Mont-sous-Vaudrey. There the peasants\r\ndread nothing so much as another war. They want peace there at any\r\nprice. Well, then, a very shrewd old farmer told me he wanted to see\r\nBoulanger made Chief of the State. Why? Why because, as he said,\r\nBoulanger is the first general in Europe, and the Germans know it, and\r\nthey go in fear of him; so that if Boulanger is made Chief of the State,\r\nthey will think twice before they attack us! What do you say to that?'\r\n\r\n'Is it not extraordinary,' I replied, 'that this legend, as you truly\r\ncall it, should have been created so easily about a general who has no\r\nbattle to show for it; not even a Montenotte, much less an Arcola or a\r\nLodi?'\r\n\r\n'What legend had Bonaparte when Barras put him at the head of the home\r\narmy, and Pétiet sent him to Italy? He did not command at Toulon, and\r\nhis one victory had been to blow the marshalled blackguards and lunatics\r\nof Paris into the Seine, as Mandat might and would have done on that\r\ndismal August 10, but for that hypocritical scoundrel Pétion. And didn't\r\nthe authorities arrest Bonaparte after Toulon; and was he not struck\r\nfrom the active roll of general officers in France for refusing a\r\ncommand in La Vendée? So far as the army goes, there is better stuff for\r\na legend to-day in Boulanger than there was in Bonaparte when he went to\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n'But observe that the Government made a legend of Boulanger, not for\r\nmilitary but for political purposes. They were shut down to him. If they\r\ncould have used M. de Lesseps, and if the Panama Canal had been a\r\nsuccess, Lesseps would have served their purpose better than Boulanger.\r\nWithout a \"great Frenchman,\" I tell you the republic is impossible. Are\r\nthey not trying to make a \"great Frenchman\" now of Carnot? If this could\r\nbe done, if it were possible to make a \"great Frenchman\" of Carnot, I\r\nshould not object. But it is absurd. And so for me, whatever the\r\nelectors may do in September, the republic is hopeless. They made\r\nBoulanger to save it; now they are trying to unmake Boulanger to save\r\nit. It is childish, it is silly, it will not do! If they succeed in\r\nunmaking their legend of Boulanger, where are they? Not even where they\r\nwere when they began to make it. On the contrary! They have made it\r\nperfectly plain that the republic is a parachute which falls without a\r\nballoon. Where are they to find the balloon? The Exposition has given\r\nthe parachute a lift. The visit of the Prince of Wales gave it a lift.\r\nThe Shah, if he comes, will give it a lift--not much--but a lift. But\r\nall these are expedients of a moment. All these will not give the\r\nrepublic a \"great Frenchman.\"'\r\n\r\n'All this,' I said, 'seems to bring us back to what you said this\r\nmorning, that if you were not the most anarchical you would be the most\r\nmonarchical people in Europe.'\r\n\r\n'Precisely! and it is the plain truth. The republic was possible with\r\nMacMahon, for after all he was a personality. It was possible with\r\nThiers, for though he was a little rascal and the greatest literary liar\r\nof the century except Victor Hugo, he was a personality, and a very\r\npositive personality. It might have been possible with Gambetta, for he\r\ntoo was a personality, odious and flatulent if you like, but still a\r\npersonality. It was not possible with Grévy. It is not possible with\r\nCarnot.\r\n\r\n'Let the elections go as they may, you will see that I am right. I wash\r\nmy hands of it all. But when I think of it I see on the wall _Finis\r\nGalliæ_! For while I despair of the republic, I have no hope of a\r\nmonarchy. Nothing but a personality can carry on the republic--and\r\nnothing but a personality can restore the monarchy.\r\n\r\n'The friends of the poor little Prince Imperial understood this when\r\nthey consented to let him go off to South Africa. If he had been in the\r\nhands of an English general of common sense, or of an English captain of\r\ncommon courage, he would no doubt have come back safe and sound. And in\r\nthat case the odds are that we should be living to-day under the Third\r\nEmpire instead of the Third Republic.\r\n\r\n'As it is, the Empire, between the significance of Plon-Plon, and the\r\ninsignificance of Prince Victor, is like the Republic between Ferry, the\r\nTonkinese, and Carnot, who ought to spell his name _Carton_!'\r\n\r\n'But how is it with the royalists?'\r\n\r\n'Ah! their only \"personality\" known to the people--and that is the value\r\nof a personality in France--is the Duc d'Aumale--and who knows whether\r\nthe Duc d'Aumale is a royalist? I have no doubt--absolutely no doubt,'\r\nhe said with some emphasis, 'that Say and De Freycinet to-morrow would\r\ngladly join forces with the Conservatives to make the Duc d'Aumale\r\npresident if the Conservatives would agree to it, and if the Duc would\r\naccept the place; for that would give the Republic a new lease of life\r\nin the first place, and in the second place it would utterly\r\ndisintegrate the royalists, both white and blue. If the Duc is not a\r\n\"great Frenchman\" in the electoral sense of the phrase, he is the most\r\ncreditably conspicuous of living Frenchmen, which is something.'\r\n\r\n'More so than his nephew the Comte de Paris?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, certainly, in the popular mind. Personally, I do not think he\r\nwould make either so good a president of a republic, or so good a king\r\nas the Comte de Paris, whose manifesto I think shows him to be a man of\r\nclear and sound constitutional ideas, but the French people do not know\r\nhim. It was a blunder, by the way, in my opinion,' he added after a\r\nmoment, 'of Boulanger to expel the Comte de Paris. His exile and his\r\naction in exile have made him better known in France than he would have\r\nbeen, had he been left to live quietly at Eu and in Paris. Furthermore,\r\nwhat sort of a republic is it in which a family of princes cannot live\r\nwithout tempting the whole population to make one of them king? The\r\nexpulsion of the princes belongs to the same category of political\r\nidiocies with the _pacte de famine_. Either the Republic is a reality\r\naccepted by the French people, or it is a sham imposed upon them by a\r\nparty. If it is a reality, the princes are simply French citizens, as\r\nmuch entitled to live in France under the protection of the laws as if\r\nthey were peasants. From this there is no escape logically or morally,\r\nand the men who voted for such an edict are neither good Republicans nor\r\ngood Frenchmen. From the moment it was enacted and executed, the\r\nRepublic ceased to be a national government. It was a _coup d'état_ and\r\nnot a legal act, and every legislator who voted for it committed perjury\r\nat least as distinctly as the author of the _coup d'état_ of 1851. Could\r\nsuch a law possibly have been passed in your republic?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not,' I said. 'In fact, the people of many American States\r\nare free to treat with all possible public and private distinction a\r\npersonage who not only was elected to a position which may be called\r\nprincely, but who actually exercised for several years a greater\r\nauthority over millions of American citizens than has belonged to any\r\nFrench king since Louis XVI., and, exercising it, waged war against the\r\nUnited States. But was there no pretence of constitutional authority for\r\nthe passage of this law which you so strongly denounce?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not. There was no shadow of a legal pretext for passing it.\r\nIt is, I think, the worst and also the silliest instance in our recent\r\nhistory of an appeal to that argument of rogues and tyrants called\r\n_salus populi_, as to which I am of the opinion of Louis Blanc, that the\r\n\"safety\" of no nation under heaven \"is worth the sacrifice of a single\r\nprinciple of common justice.\"\r\n\r\n'It was a blow struck in broad daylight at the personal rights of every\r\nFrench citizen; just as the removal of the princes from the army was a\r\nblow struck in broad daylight at the property rights of every French\r\nofficer. That it was possible for a Government to strike these blows in\r\ncold blood, with no popular excitement instigating them, and with no\r\npublic resentment following them, should show you, I think, how absurd\r\nit is to talk of the French people as a republican people. Any\r\nGovernment in power at Paris may be as arbitrary as it likes, but it\r\nmust not be stupid. The expulsion of the princes was a crime against\r\nliberty; it was as arbitrary an act as the issue of a _lettre de\r\ncachet_. But it was also very stupid. It was stupid of the Government\r\nbecause it put them for a time under the thumb of Boulanger. It was\r\nstupid of Boulanger, because it put the Comte de Paris at once on a\r\npedestal and forced him before France and Europe into the position of a\r\nsaviour of society, for whom all the conservative forces of French\r\nsociety must henceforth inevitably work. Whatever becomes of Boulanger\r\nin the next elections, he has condemned the Opportunists irretrievably\r\neither to hew wood for the Socialists or to carry water for the\r\nMonarchists. And with them he has condemned himself. Wait and see if I\r\nam not right.\r\n\r\n'Come and see me in Picardy. You will find more royalist farmers than I\r\ncould have believed possible six years ago. If the Comte de Chambord had\r\nnot kept the Legitimist country gentlemen so much apart as a caste from\r\nthe peasants, there would be nothing easier than to sweep the country\r\nwith a monarchist propaganda. It was the royalist peasantry who brought\r\nabout the great emigration in 1789, long before the Terror, by burning\r\nand pillaging the châteaux all over France under orders from Paris,\r\nwhich they believed to be orders from the king. What puzzles them now is\r\nthe notion lurking down in the bottom of their minds that the\r\nrestoration of the monarchy will somehow put the country gentlemen over\r\nthem, and this has much to do with making them, not republicans, but\r\nimperialists. As to the republic the overthrow of Grévy had a very bad\r\neffect upon the peasants and the farmers in my part of the country, and\r\nI believe it had everywhere.'\r\n\r\n'Was M. Grévy, then, popular with them?'\r\n\r\n'No, it was not that at all. It was the feeling that the Republic meant\r\nchanges and uncertainty. A farmer--a fair specimen of this class in my\r\ncountry--expressed this to me in his own fashion only the other day. I\r\nasked him if he was coming to see the President here at Calais. \"What is\r\nthe use of that?\" he said, \"it is money out of pocket, and for what? Who\r\nknows how long he will be President? There was Grévy. Here is Boulanger.\r\nAll that can do no good. With these short leases what can be done for\r\nthe land?\" There you have it. In Picardy and in Artois the people have\r\nlong memories about the land. All these countries, as you know, were\r\nfought over again and again. There were so many wars that people got out\r\nof the way of making long leases, and the land suffered accordingly. In\r\nthe last century these provinces, now so well and so richly cultivated,\r\nwere in a very bad way through this. With leases of three, six, nine\r\nyears, the farmers naturally took as few risks as possible in the way of\r\nimproving the land. They were always making up the waste caused by the\r\nprevious tenant, or shy of investing for the benefit of the next tenant.\r\nTowards the end of the century, and before the Revolution, small\r\nholdings began to increase, and the English fashion of long leases came\r\nin, and the agriculture improved accordingly. So you see why our farmers\r\ntend to monarchy from the point of view of long leases and land\r\nownership, just as these sailors and fishermen here in the Boulonnais\r\ntend to it from the point of view of seamanship. You will make\r\nrepublicans of them when you get them to let the forecastle elect the\r\ncook captain. That will not be to-morrow nor, I think, next week.'\r\n\r\nI left Calais late at night for Boulogne, my friend going into Picardy,\r\nwhere I promised to join him later on. There was an immense crowd at the\r\nstation, and I could not help admiring the good nature and cheery\r\ncivility of the porters. The sub-officials in silver lace were not so\r\nadmirable, but then they were only strutting about and objecting to\r\nthings. The honest fellows who were getting twice as many passengers\r\ninto a train as the train could possibly take, and helping bewildered\r\nprovincials to find out where they really wanted to go, were, I thought,\r\nmiraculously amiable and intelligent.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment, just as we were moving off, a lively Parisian\r\njournalist tumbled into our compartment with his despatch-box and his\r\nportmanteau. He was in the full evening dress in which he had been\r\nparading about all day with the Presidential party; his white cravat was\r\nloose and awry, and the grey dust of the Calais streets and piers lay\r\nthick upon his glossy bottines; but he was in the best of spirits, for\r\nhe had caught the train and would now reach Paris in the morning.\r\n\r\n'But the President is going on to Boulogne, is he not?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes! but what of that? It will be just what it was to-day, and I\r\nknow what he is going to say. He will leave Boulogne early in the\r\nafternoon, and we shall have it all, an excellent account. It's not\r\nworth while to waste the time on Boulogne.'\r\n\r\nHe had been with the President ever since the party left Paris, and\r\nthought the progression the whole, a success. 'Not at Calais,' that he\r\nadmitted. There had certainly been no great enthusiasm at Calais. He did\r\nnot think there had been any cries for Boulanger, but there was no\r\nemotion. This he explained by telling me that the people had not been\r\nproperly '_stylé_.' 'In these cases, you know,' he said with the air of\r\na connoisseur in enthusiasm, 'you must have a certain subtle _stylage_.'\r\n\r\nThe word was new to me, but not so the thing. For I presently found that\r\nby a 'subtle _stylage_' of the people, my companion only meant what in\r\nAmerica is known as 'working up a boom,' when the welfare of the Union\r\nrequires that a President, or a presidential candidate, should\r\nperambulate a certain number of 'doubtful' States, or, in the\r\npicturesque language of the days of Andrew Johnson, go 'swinging round\r\nthe circle.' If I am not misinformed, an analogous operation is\r\noccasionally performed in England, when some popular idol finds it worth\r\nhis while to make an unpremeditated political tour.\r\n\r\n'The thing was better done at Lens,' said my fellow-traveller. 'Do you\r\nknow Lens? They are all miners there, you know--very curious people. I\r\nsuppose they were glad to come up from under the ground and look at us.\r\nSome of the women, too, were pretty--really very pretty. It was all very\r\nwell arranged. There is a good manager there, M.----. He made way, you\r\nknow, in 1886, for Camescasse, to oblige the Government. The President\r\ngave him the Cross. It had a very good effect. At Bapaume, too, the\r\nPresident did a good thing. He decorated ---- there, who had so much\r\ntrouble with the Christian Brothers.'\r\n\r\n'For having trouble with the Christian Brothers?' I could not help\r\nasking.\r\n\r\n'No! but the courts decided against him, and that was a misfortune. The\r\nPresident put it right by decorating him, for it is evident that he\r\nmeant to do his duty, and a Government must stand by its friends. Do you\r\nknow Bapaume? It is a pretty place--all factories. It was there, you\r\nknow, that Faidherbe beat the Germans. A very pretty place.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIN THE PAS-DE-CALAIS--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOULOGNE\r\n\r\nBoulogne now, as in the days of Arthur Young, is surrounded with bright\r\nand pleasant villas and country houses, though many of the châteaux\r\nwhich Young was so much surprised to find inhabited by country gentlemen\r\nattending to their duties and living on their estates have disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt is not only a larger and a more lively place than Calais; it is a\r\nmore picturesque and a more interesting place. The old walls and\r\nramparts of the upper town make such a striking contrast with the modern\r\nstreets and squares of the lower town as reminds one vaguely of Quebec,\r\nthe Channel coming into the landscape like the St. Lawrence. As at\r\nQuebec, too, the two civilisations of France and of England meet without\r\nmingling; and at Boulogne, as at Quebec, the French type, if not the\r\nstronger of the two, certainly proves itself to be the subtler, and\r\ndecides the local physiognomy.\r\n\r\nI spent an hour at Boulogne, with a friend who now fills an important\r\necclesiastical position in one of the provinces of Central France, and\r\nwho was passing a few weeks on the Channel for his health. He is one of\r\nthe few French churchmen I personally know who heartily agree with\r\nCardinal Manning in thinking that the abolition of the Concordat would\r\ngreatly strengthen the Church in France, even if it involved a further\r\nserious sacrifice of the proprietary rights of the clergy. 'The way in\r\nwhich the people have come forward to the support of the congreganist\r\nschools against, the oppressive measures adopted in the law of 1886,' he\r\nsaid, 'confirms my old conviction, that a complete separation of the\r\nChurch from the State in France, whatever its effect might be upon the\r\nState, would strengthen the Church.'\r\n\r\nHe cited a number of instances within his own knowledge in which rival\r\ncommunes had established, and were carrying on, at the direct expense of\r\nthe local farmers and residents, free or congreganist schools, while, of\r\ncourse, at the same time they were paying taxes for the lay public\r\nschools to which they would not send their children. 'And this in\r\nspite,' he said, 'of the ingenious devices with which the law of 1886\r\nbristles for making the establishment of free and Christian schools\r\ndifficult and expensive. For example, to begin with, the legislature\r\nactually tried to prevent us from calling our schools free schools,\r\nthough as schools supported by the free subscriptions of the people they\r\nwere distinctly \"free\" schools, as distinguished from the schools\r\nestablished by the law at the expense of the taxpayers. We were gravely\r\ninformed that it was an act of war to call a free school free! In this\r\nsame petty and childish spirit the congregations are called\r\n\"associations\" in the text of the law. When a free school is to be\r\nopened, the teacher who is to have charge of it must run the gauntlet of\r\na series of public officers, all of them, if they are on good terms with\r\nthe Government, presumably hostile to him as a Christian. He begins with\r\nthe mayor of the Commune, who may object to his opening the school in\r\nthe place he has chosen, on grounds of \"good morals or of hygiene.\"\r\nThen he must go through with the Prefect of the Department, the Academic\r\nInspector, and the Procureur of the Republic.'\r\n\r\n'That is to say,' I asked, 'the law officer of the department? Why\r\nshould he be brought into the business?'\r\n\r\n'Why, indeed,' replied my friend. 'You must ask M. Ferry or M.\r\nClémenceau. He can stir up the Academic Inspector to make some objection\r\nto the opening of the free school, if the Academic Inspector does not\r\nfind and make an objection himself. If no objections are made within a\r\nmonth the school may be opened. If objections are made they must be made\r\nbefore the Council of the Department within a month. If the Council\r\nsupport the objections, the teacher must appeal from the decision to the\r\nAcademic Inspector within ten days, and the Inspector must submit this\r\nappeal to the Superior Council of Public Instruction at the next ensuing\r\nsession of that body. Now the Superior Council only meets twice a year,\r\nand as the appeal, according to the law, is only required to be heard\r\n\"with the least possible delay,\" you will see that nothing can be easier\r\nthan for the Academic Inspector and the Procureur between them to keep a\r\ndecision in the air for months, or for a year, or even longer, and\r\npending the appeal the school cannot be opened.\r\n\r\n'As for the departmental councils, which are first to consider the\r\nobjections made to the opening of the school, they no longer include, as\r\nthey did under the Empire, representatives of the Catholic clergy, the\r\nProtestant sects, and the Israelites. All of these are struck out of the\r\ncouncils by this law of 1886, though fully ninety-nine hundredths of all\r\nthe taxes paid to support the machinery, not only of public education\r\nbut of the State, are paid by the Catholics, Protestants, and\r\nIsraelites. Nor are the councils any longer allowed to elect their own\r\nvice-presidents. The prefect, a government _employé_, presides over the\r\ncouncils. The Academic Inspector, another government _employé_, is\r\nofficially the president; four councillors-general, elected by the whole\r\nbody of the council-general of the department, sit on the Departments of\r\nPrimary Instruction Council, as do also the director or directors of the\r\nNormal Schools of Public Teachers, and four teachers, two male and two\r\nfemale, to be elected by the whole body of lay public school teachers of\r\nboth sexes in the department, all of them paid _employés_ of the\r\nGovernment; and finally, two inspectors of public primary education\r\nnominated by the Minister of Public Instruction. So, as you see, out of\r\na council consisting of fourteen members, ten are paid servants of the\r\nGovernment, directly concerned to discourage the development of the\r\nChristian schools. If questions and disputes between the lay public\r\nschools and the free Christian schools came before this council, one lay\r\nand one congreganist teacher may be admitted to join the council. But\r\nthe wise and just provision of the earlier law, that two or more\r\nmagistrates of the highest repute should be members of these councils,\r\nhas been deliberately struck out of this aggressive law of 1886.\r\n\r\n'Is it possible,' he said, 'to mistake either the spirit or the object\r\nof such a law?\r\n\r\n'What gives me confidence and hope is the unquestionable effect which\r\nthe law has had upon the religious life of France. It has aroused and\r\nstimulated it to more vigour and energy than I have seen it show for\r\nyears past. If only the Church in France were to-day as free from any\r\nofficial connection with the State as it is in your country, I believe\r\nwe should see such a revival of Catholic faith as has not been known in\r\nEurope for centuries.\r\n\r\n'Do you remember,' he went on, 'how Ferry went to Rome after his\r\nexpulsion from power? Yes? And doubtless you know what efforts he made\r\nthere at that time to bring about a subterranean understanding between\r\nhimself and the Vatican?'\r\n\r\n'He is the only one of these Opportunists who really has a head on his\r\nshoulders, and you will find that he is under no illusions as to the\r\npossibility of any working alliance between the Opportunists and the\r\nRadicals which can save the former from going to the wall, like the\r\nGirondins in 1793.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' he said, laughingly, 'we may live to see M. Ferry doing\r\npenance in a white sheet, with a candle in his hand, on the way to a\r\nseat in a monarchical Cabinet! Though I am no politician, yet--mark my\r\nwords!--this republic has been so mismanaged that now it cannot live\r\nwithout the Radicals--and it cannot live with them!\r\n\r\n'As for the Church; if you want to see what life and energy it is\r\nshowing in its work, come and see me in the autumn. I will show you in\r\nthe Limousin one of the establishments of the Congregation of the Holy\r\nCross, or you can go into Mayenne and see twelve or fifteen of them. Or\r\nyou ought to go to Ruille-sur-la-Loire, to see the modest cradle of this\r\ngreat congregation, which now, from its mother-house at Neuilly, is\r\nsending out Catholic life and faith all over the world, and the pulse of\r\nwhich is beating higher in France to-day than at any time since that\r\ntrue and simple servant of God, Dujarié, took it upon himself, from his\r\nobscure little parsonage, to begin the restoration of the Church from\r\nthe crash of the Terror and the calamities of the First Empire.'\r\n\r\n'How many years ago was it,' I asked, 'when this Congregation began its\r\nwork in the United States?'\r\n\r\n'Not quite fifty years ago,' he replied, 'and, as you know, its schools\r\nare flourishing in all parts of your Union, from the University (in\r\nIndiana) of Our Lady of the Lake, to New Orleans and New Jersey, and\r\nfrom Wisconsin to Texas. It numbers its pupils, too, by thousands here\r\nat home in France.\r\n\r\n'I ask you to join me in the Limousin because I hope to be there in\r\nOctober, and then I can show you at Limoges what I am sure you would\r\nlike to see--one of our best cathedrals, and some beautiful old glass in\r\nSt.-Michel and St.-Pierre, not to mention the enamels still hidden away\r\nhere and there in certain houses I wot of!'\r\n\r\n\r\n  ST.-OMER\r\n\r\nTwo of the most interesting places in the Pas-de-Calais are St.-Omer,\r\nonce a name of terror to the worthy Englishmen who went in constant fear\r\nof the Pope and wooden shoes, and Aire-sur-la-Lys, which now embraces\r\nwithin its communal limits all that remains to-day of the once famous\r\nand important city of Thérouanne, the ancient capital of Morinia, and\r\nfor thirty years the episcopal seat of the great Swiss bishop, St.-Omer,\r\nwho made North-Eastern Gaul Christian in the seventh century.\r\n\r\nSt.-Omer still preserves a certain grave and austere physiognomy,\r\nhalf-Spanish and half-scholastic; and it is easy for the imagination to\r\npeople its quiet streets with the English and Irish students who\r\nfrequented its collegiate halls from the days of Guy Faux to the days of\r\nDaniel O'Connell. But its importance is now military, not theological.\r\nM. Pierre de la Gorce, the accomplished historian of the Revolution of\r\n1848, who lived here seven years as a magistrate, and who still resides\r\nhere because he finds in the place 'a still air of delightful studies'\r\ncongenial to his tastes and favourable to his historical labours, told\r\nme, in the course of a most interesting afternoon which I passed here\r\nwith him, that the town is full of families living here on their\r\nincomes; and in going about the streets I was struck with the general\r\nair of quiet and unobtrusive well-being which marks the people. In his\r\nposition as a magistrate, M. de la Gorce had the best possible\r\nopportunities for gauging the moral character of the inhabitants, and he\r\nassured me that during the whole period of his residence in St.-Omer,\r\nextending now over twelve or thirteen years, he has never known more\r\nthan one serious domestic scandal to disturb the even tenour of its\r\nsocial life. Of how many towns of twenty thousand inhabitants could the\r\nsame thing be truly said in England or the United States? During all\r\nthese years, too, M. de la Gorce tells me, only two cases of alleged\r\nmisconduct on the part of priests have occurred in St.-Omer, and in one\r\nof these cases the allegation was proved malignant and unfounded.\r\nPolitically, St.-Omer seems to be strongly Republican. In 1886 it gave\r\nthe Government candidate a majority of 1,281 votes on a total of 6,623,\r\nwhereas in Boulogne at the same election the Republicans were beaten in\r\nthe southern division, and carried the whole city by only a majority of\r\n1,331 votes out of a total of 8,233.\r\n\r\nWhat I heard in St.-Omer of the officers stationed there was\r\nparticularly interesting. There is a large garrison, and the greatest\r\npains are taken by the officers not only with the military discipline,\r\nbut with the schooling and general conduct of the troops. My own\r\nobservation leads me to think this true, not of St.-Omer only, but of\r\nall the considerable garrison towns which I have visited in France\r\nduring the past six or seven years. The old type of swashbuckling,\r\nabsinthe-tippling, rakehelly French officer of whom, during the last\r\nyears of the Empire, one saw and heard so much, seems to have passed\r\naway into history and literature. However it may be with the\r\n'gaiter-buttons' in the next great war, I do not believe the staff of\r\nthe next invading army will have much to teach the French officers of\r\nto-day, either about the principles of scientific warfare or about the\r\ntopography of France.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that there are more French officers in St.-Omer\r\nalone to-day who can read and understand German than there were in all\r\nFrance in 1870. The _morale_ and carriage of the soldiers, too, are\r\ndistinctly higher. The calling of men of all ranks and conditions under\r\nthe colours has necessarily raised the moral and social level of the\r\nrank and file as well as of the officers; and it is quite certain that\r\nthe army holds a higher place in the estimation of the better classes in\r\nFrance than it used to hold. M. de la Gorce cited to me several\r\ninstances, here at St.-Omer, of young ladies of excellent family, three\r\nof them at least considerable heiresses, who have married young officers\r\nof merit solely because they were officers of merit, and who have gladly\r\nturned their backs on the flutter and glitter of fashionable Paris to\r\nshare the quiet, unpretending quarters, and take a sympathetic interest\r\nin the serious military career of their husbands in this rather\r\nout-of-the-way garrison town.\r\n\r\nI do not find M. de la Gorce sanguine as to any early solution of the\r\npolitical problems with which France is still wrestling after a hundred\r\nyears. He makes no secret of his conviction that nothing but a return to\r\nthe constitutional monarchy can give the country lasting peace at home,\r\nor real influence abroad. But his impression seems to be that time alone\r\ncan bring this about. He would have the royalists unfurl their banner,\r\ngo into the elections with a plain declaration of their political creed,\r\nand await the progress of events. He cited, as a proof of the wisdom of\r\nthis policy, the steady advance made by the Republicans after a mere\r\nhandful of them came into the imperial legislature. They grew from five\r\nto thirty, simply because they stood firmly on their own principles,\r\nwhile the majority were disturbed and uncertain. The principle of the\r\nhereditary constitutional monarchy, he thought, should be plainly\r\naffirmed and presented to the French people, as their only real\r\nsafeguard against the incessant disturbance and displacement of the\r\nexecutive machinery which results from the election of an executive\r\nchief.\r\n\r\n'Let this be affirmed and presented,' said M. de la Gorce,' by a\r\nnumber--no matter how small it may be at first--of sincere and resolute\r\nmen, and every successive shock and catastrophe will bring more and more\r\nsupport to them from all classes in France.'\r\n\r\nM. de la Gorce is of the opinion that the laicisation of the schools,\r\nwhatever may be said of the motives and intent of those who have\r\npromoted it, has had a good effect on the congreganist schools, by\r\nstimulating the teachers and directors to make greater efforts for the\r\nimprovement of their methods and their general machinery of instruction.\r\nThis is quite in accord with the views of my friend whom I met at\r\nBoulogne--and indeed it is in the nature of things.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the laicisation is carried out by the subaltern\r\nauthorities seems to be admirably calculated also to inflame the\r\nreligious zeal of the people. A very intelligent and liberal\r\necclesiastic, living here, tells me that, while M. Ferry is professing\r\nin the Chamber his great anxiety to co-operate with the Conservatives in\r\nmodifying the decrees of 1791, in regard to religious associations, and\r\ntalking about a more liberal treatment of the clergy and the Christian\r\nfree schools, the local functionaries here, in Artois, lose no\r\nopportunity of irritating and annoying the Christian population. In the\r\nvillage of Moislains near Péronne, for example, he tells me the funeral\r\ntook place the other day of the Abbé Sallier, for many years the curé of\r\nthat parish; a man so much respected and beloved by the whole community\r\nthat, notwithstanding an express request made by him in his will, that\r\nno discourse might be pronounced at his interment, and that it might be\r\nmade as simple as possible, the people insisted on escorting the remains\r\nto the cemetery in a long procession headed by the mayor, the municipal\r\ncouncil, and all the notabilities of the country round about. Naturally\r\nthe people wished that their children, most of whom had been baptized by\r\nthe abbé, might join in this procession; to prevent which an express\r\norder was issued by the school authorities, that the children should not\r\nbe allowed to leave the school for that purpose. It is difficult to see\r\nhow a petty persecution of this sort can be expected to promote the\r\n'religious peace' about which M. Ferry perorates at Paris. The rural\r\nArtesians, my friend tells me, resent these proceedings very bitterly,\r\nand show their feelings in the most practical fashion, by subscribing\r\nfreely to carry on the religious primary schools, and refusing to let\r\ntheir children attend the lay schools, which are kept up by the\r\nGovernment out of the taxes paid by themselves. This, with a thrifty and\r\nrather parsimonious population, like that which increases and multiplies\r\nso steadily in Artois, is a most significant fact.\r\n\r\nThe Marist Brethren, who have their headquarter at the Ecole de Notre\r\nDame in Albert, a town of some 4,000 inhabitants, about half-way between\r\nArras and Amiens, are carrying on these religious schools most\r\nsuccessfully. Albert itself is a very curious and interesting place.\r\nThere are remains here of Roman fortifications which show that it was a\r\npoint of importance under the Empire, and subterranean excavations of a\r\nmost remarkable character, one of them extending for more than two\r\nmiles. Down to the time of Henry IV. Albert was known as Ancre. Concini,\r\nthe Florentine favourite of Mary de' Medici, bought the lordship of\r\nAncre with the title of marquis. With the help of his clever Florentine\r\nwife, Leonora Galigai, he completely subjugated the queen and her weak\r\nson, Louis XIII.; and, without so much as drawing his sword in battle,\r\nmade himself a marshal of France, How all this led him on to his ruin I\r\nneed not recite. He was stabbed to death in the precincts of the Louvre\r\nby Vitry; his wife, arraigned as a sorceress, was strangled and burned;\r\nand their unfortunate little son was degraded. The marquisate and\r\nlordship of Ancre were bought, oddly enough, by another and very\r\ndifferent Florentine race, the Alberti, who had come into France and\r\nestablished themselves in the Venaissin a hundred years before. So\r\nintense was the general hatred of the Concinis, that, upon acquiring\r\nAncre, the Alberti unbaptized the place and gave it their own French\r\nname of Albert, which is still most honourably borne by their\r\nrepresentatives, the ducal houses of Luynes and of Chaulnes. It is\r\ncommon enough in France, as it is in England, to find the names of\r\nfamilies perpetuated in conjunction with those of places once their\r\nproperty--Kingston-Lacy, Stanton-Harcourt, Bagot's Bromley, Melton\r\nMowbray are English cases in point. But this displacement of an old\r\nterritorial designation by a family name is unusual. Some thing like it\r\nhas taken place in our own times and in a remote south-western corner of\r\nFrance, where the people of Arles-les-Bains changed the name of their\r\npleasant little town of orange groves and olives to Amélie, to\r\ncommemorate their respect and affection for the excellent queen of Louis\r\nPhilippe.\r\n\r\nThere are factories at Albert; and a modern church is building there,\r\nnot to the unmixed delight of architects and archæologists. But my\r\nconcern now is with the work of the Marist Brothers who have made Albert\r\ntheir headquarters.\r\n\r\nThis work is carried on with the direct and active co-operation of the\r\npeople. At one little hamlet, for example, called, I think, Brébières,\r\nnearly a hundred children now attend the Marist school, whose parents\r\npay for each child a subscription of three francs a month. There, not\r\nlong ago, it was found that in one poor family of peasants a family\r\ncouncil had been called to raise this modest sum in order that one of\r\nthe children now of an age to attend the school might be sent to it. The\r\ntwo elder children settled the question by insisting that they would\r\ngive up their own daily ration of milk to meet the expense.\r\n\r\nWill France be a nobler and stronger country when the priests who train\r\nthe children of her peasantry into this spirit are driven out of the\r\nland?\r\n\r\nThis is the real question which must be met and answered by the\r\nadvocates of compulsory lay education in the public schools.\r\n\r\nThe next step to be taken in the 'laicisation' of the schools has been\r\nalready revealed in the famous 'Article 7' of M. Ferry. M. Ferry is the\r\ntrue, though more or less occult, head of the present Administration in\r\nFrance. 'M. Ferry,' said a caustic French Radical to me in Paris, 'ought\r\nto be the mask of M. Carnot. Nature gave him a Carnival nose for that\r\npurpose. Everything is topsy-turvy now in France, and so M. Carnot is\r\nthe mask of M. Ferry. But the nose will come through before long.'\r\n\r\nMany years ago the public conscience of Philadelphia, then as now one of\r\nthe most Protestant of American Protestant cities, was scandalised by\r\nthe will of a French merchant, Stephen Girard; who, after acquiring a\r\nlarge fortune in that city, left it to found a college, within the\r\nprecincts of which no minister of religion was, on any pretext whatever,\r\nto be allowed to appear. The stupid bigotry of this ignorant millionaire\r\nwas the high-water mark of French Republican liberality during the\r\ndismal orgie of the First Republic. It is still the high-water mark of\r\nFrench Republican liberality under the Third Republic. The dream and\r\ndesire of M. Ferry and his friends are to prohibit ministers of religion\r\nfrom taking any part whatever in the education of the French people.\r\nAlready the municipal council of Paris has undertaken to 'bowdlerise'\r\nthe literature of the world in order to prevent the minds of the young\r\nfrom being perverted by coming into contact with the name of God. These\r\ngood butchers and bakers and candlestick-makers of the Seine really\r\nbelieve, like certain more academical persons of higher social\r\npretensions in England and America, that the ineffable simpletons and\r\nscoundrels who for three or four years during the last decade of the\r\nlast century made ducks and drakes at Paris of the public fortune and\r\nthe private rights of the French people, were inspired harbingers of a\r\nnew era. Outside of France it may be hard to suppose this possible, but\r\nnothing can be more certain than that the educational legislation of\r\nFrance since 1882 has been aimed steadily and directly at the abolition,\r\nnot of Christianity alone, but of all religion.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see the common school system of New England, which in\r\nthe beginning was the device of a theocracy bent on usurping the\r\nauthority of parents over their children, taken up after more than two\r\nhundred years, and readjusted to the purposes of a set of men whom the\r\nPuritans would have unhesitatingly whipped to death at the cart's tail\r\nas blasphemers.\r\n\r\nOnly the other day, in the Chamber, an ardent Republican member, M.\r\nPichon, made a speech in which he openly avowed the object of laicising\r\nthe schools to be the destruction of religion. 'Between you, the\r\nCatholics,' he exclaimed, 'and us, who are Republicans, there is a great\r\nabyss. The interests of the Church are incompatible with those of the\r\nRepublican Government.' That the Republicans in the Assembly should have\r\napplauded this declaration is rather astonishing, since it was in\r\nsubstance an admission that the interests of the 'Republican Government'\r\nare inconsistent with those of an admittedly immense majority of the\r\nFrench people. But they did applaud it, and not long before M. Pichon\r\nmade the speech a solid Republican vote of 232 members had been recorded\r\nfor the suppression of the French Embassy to the Vatican. Is it\r\nsurprising that the Catholics of France should be asking themselves all\r\nover the country whether it is possible for them to accept the Republic\r\nwithout abjuring their religion?\r\n\r\nThe 'abyss' of which M. Pichon speaks has been dug, not by the Church,\r\nbut by the theorists who have expelled the Sisters of Charity from the\r\nhospitals and the chaplains from the prisons of France, who refuse to\r\nthe poor the right to pray in the almshouses, and who throw the\r\ncrucifix out of school-houses which are maintained by the money of\r\nCatholic taxpayers. As between M. Pichon and M. Ferry and their\r\nfellow-conspirators on one side of this abyss, and the Marist Brethren\r\nand the little children of France on the other side of it, the history\r\nof the world hardly encourages the belief that it is the Marist Brethren\r\nand the little children who will finally be engulfed!\r\n\r\nIt is a notable proof of the hold which Catholic ideas have upon the\r\npeople in this part of France, that notwithstanding a marked tendency to\r\nemigration among the peasantry of the Boulonnais and of Artois, the\r\npopulation has steadily increased through the excess of births over\r\ndeaths. This is not true of France as a whole. On the contrary, while\r\nthe deaths in France in 1888 were 837,857, against an annual average of\r\n847,968 from 1884 to 1887, the births diminished from an annual average\r\nof 937,090 between 1881 and 1884 to 882,639 in 1888, leaving the small\r\nexcess of 44,772 over the deaths. Of these only 33,458 were of French\r\nparentage! In Artois and the Boulonnais, the population is more dense\r\nthan in any other part of France, excepting the metropolitan regions.\r\nWhile France, as a whole, in 1881, gave an average of seventy\r\ninhabitants to the square kilomètre, which is the precise proportion in\r\nBavaria--the arrondissement of Béthune in the coal-mining country of\r\nArtois (fed by an exceptional immigration from Belgium) gave 173 to the\r\nsquare kilomètre, which exceeds the proportion in any division of the\r\nGerman Empire except Saxony, Lübeck, Bremen, and Hamburg.\r\n\r\nThe Department of the Pas-de-Calais, as a whole, gave 117 inhabitants to\r\nthe square kilomètre, which is the precise proportion in Saxe-Altenburg,\r\nand exceeds by five the proportion in the British Islands taken as a\r\nwhole. In the arrondissement of St.-Omer the rate of increase by natural\r\ngrowth some years ago outran that of the older sea-board States of the\r\nAmerican Union.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon cannot be explained by the improvidence of the\r\nArtesians, for they are admittedly remarkable, even in France, for\r\ntheir frugality and their forecasting habit of mind. A friend of mine,\r\nwho lives near St.-Omer, is probably right when he attributes it to\r\ntheir strong domestic tastes and habits, and to the influence over them\r\nof their religion. He says they are 'fanatics of the family.' Certainly\r\nin the cottages the children seem to have things all their own way,\r\nalmost as much as in America. 'The Artesian parents,' my friend tells\r\nme, 'make their children the objects of their lives.' In the rural\r\nregions there is not much immorality. Concubinage, which is by no means\r\nuncommon in the towns, is exceedingly uncommon in the country of Artois.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural Artesian wishes to be the recognised head of his house,\r\nhates to have things at loose ends, and habitually makes his wife a\r\nconsulting partner in all his affairs. Even when he is not particularly\r\ndevout he likes to be on good terms with, his curate, and has very\r\npositive ideas as to what is decent and becoming. 'In short,' said my\r\nfriend, 'he is an ideal husbandman in every sense of that English word,\r\nfor which we have no equivalent. The assize records show that offences\r\nagainst public morality are almost wholly confined to the towns in\r\nArtois, and it is a notable fact that these particular offences are much\r\nmore frequently committed by persons who can read and write than by the\r\nilliterate.'\r\n\r\nMy friend seemed to be startled when I told him that this 'notable fact'\r\nappeared to me to be quite in accordance with the nature of things, as\r\nset forth in the sound old maxim cited by the Apostle, that 'evil\r\ncommunications corrupt good manners.' So long as thirty years ago, the\r\nAmerican Census showed that in the six New England States, in which the\r\nproportion of illiterate native Americans to the native white\r\npopulation was 1 to 312, the proportion to the native white population\r\nof native white criminals was 1 to 1,084; whereas, in the six southern\r\nStates of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, and the two Carolinas,\r\nthe proportion of native white illiterates being 1 to 12 of the native\r\nwhite population, the proportion of native white criminals to the native\r\nwhite population was only 1 to 6,670. Mr. Montgomery of California,\r\nAssistant-Attorney-General of the United States in the Administration of\r\nPresident Cleveland, working on the lines of inquiry suggested by such\r\nfacts as these, did not hesitate, two years ago, to assert that 'the\r\nboasted New England public school system, as now by law established\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the American Republic, is a\r\npoisonous fountain fraught with the seeds of human misery and moral\r\ndeath.' He cites the official statistics given by a New England\r\nprofessor, Mr. Royce, to prove that 'there is hardly a state or country\r\nin the civilised world, where atrocious and flagrant crimes are so\r\ncommon as in educated Massachusetts,' and he shows that the alarming and\r\nunquestionable increase of crime in the United States cannot be\r\nattributed, as it too often is, to the 'foreign element in American\r\nsociety, the criminal rate of which has remained the same or even\r\nlessened, while the native criminals increased during 1860-1870, from\r\n10,143 to 24,173.' During that decade the total population of the United\r\nStates increased from 31,443,321 to 38,567,617. Deducting 2,466,752 for\r\nthe increase by immigration, we have a general increase of 4,657,538 in\r\nthe native American population, or of less than 15 per cent, against an\r\nincrease of about 140 per cent. in the number of native white criminals!\r\nIt is no part of my present purpose to discuss Mr. Montgomery's\r\ncontention. But it seems to me to deserve grave consideration in\r\nconnection with the adventure to which the French Republican Government\r\nhas committed itself, of suddenly substituting for the religious and\r\nparental system of education in France, a French modification, in the\r\ninterest of unbelief, of that American public school system which, as\r\nMr. Montgomery maintains, rests upon the principle 'that the whole\r\npeople must be educated to a certain degree at the public expense,\r\nirrespectively of any social distinctions.'\r\n\r\nI have already said that St.-Omer appears to be in its politics\r\ndecidedly Republican. An odd illustration of this I found in a hot local\r\ncontroversy waging there over the setting up of a statue in one of the\r\npublic squares, to commemorate the courage and patriotism of a local\r\nheroine, Jacqueline Robins. This statue, which, as a work of art is not\r\nunworthy to be compared with the statue of Jeanne Hachette at Beauvais,\r\nwas set up, with much ceremony, in 1884 (I believe the State paid for\r\nit), and stands upon a pedestal, with an inscription setting forth how\r\nJacqueline Robins, in the year 1710, saved the besieged city of St.-Omer\r\nby going off herself with a train of boats down the Aa to Dunkirk, and\r\nbringing back the provisions and munitions of war necessary for the\r\ndefence of the city.\r\n\r\nAs the city of St.-Omer was certainly not besieged in 1710, this\r\ninscription naturally excited the critical indignation of the local\r\nantiquaries, and on July 27, 1885, an exceedingly clear and conclusive\r\nreport on the subject was laid before the Society of Antiquaries of\r\nMorinia, a body which has done good service to the cause of history in\r\nNorthern France. From this report it plainly appears that St.-Omer was\r\nnot besieged at all in 1710. Prince Eugene, who marched into Artois with\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough in that year in pursuit of Villars, wished to\r\nattack St.-Omer after the fall of Douai and Béthune, but the\r\nStates-General of Holland would not hear of it; and the gallant defence\r\nmade of Aire-sur-la-Lys by the Marquis de Goesbriant kept the allies at\r\nbay so late in the year that no attempt upon St.-Omer could be made. The\r\nlocal chronicles rejoice over this escape, particularly, because they\r\nsay the Duke of Marlborough had vowed special vengeance against the\r\ncity, its authorities having refused to oblige him by getting out of the\r\nEnglish Jesuits' College and sending him certain papers which the\r\nDuchess of Hamilton (the wife of the brilliant duke who was killed in\r\nHyde Park by Lord Mohun and General Macartney) desired him to procure\r\nfor her use in a law suit against 'Lord Bromley.'[2] St.-Omer, then, not\r\nhaving been besieged in 1710, why should a statue be set up in honour of\r\nan Audomaraise dame for delivering it? On this point the Report of the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries throws a sufficient and interesting light. It\r\nseems that there really lived in St.-Omer in 1710 a certain dame\r\nJacqueline Isabelle Robins, obviously a woman of mark and force, since\r\nshe carried on a number of thriving industries, and among them the\r\nmanagement, under a contract, of the boats between St.-Omer, Calais, and\r\nDunkirk. Napoleon would have thought her much superior to Madame de\r\nStaël, for before she was forty years old she had married three\r\nhusbands, and surrounded herself with six or seven flourishing olive\r\nbranches. She was constantly in the law courts fighting for her rights,\r\nnot against private persons only, but against the 'mayor and échevins of\r\nthe city of St.-Omer.' Though St.-Omer, as I have said, was not besieged\r\nby the allies, it was constantly occupied by the troops of his Most\r\nChristian Majesty, who gave the magistrates and the people almost as\r\nmuch trouble as if they had been enemies, and the records show that not\r\nlong before the surrender of Aire-sur-la-Lys to the allies in November\r\n1710, the Comte d'Estaing (an ancestor of the Admiral who did such good\r\nservice to the American cause), under orders from Versailles succeeded\r\nin bringing to St.-Omer from Dunkirk a complete supply of powder and\r\nother munitions of war. It seems to be likely enough that in this\r\noperation the military authorities availed themselves of the services of\r\ndame Jacqueline and of her boats. As she was a masterful dame, and,\r\nburying her third husband, who was twelve years her junior, in 1720,\r\nlived on to depart at the age of seventy-five in 1732, a local legend\r\nevidently grew up about her personal share in the events of the great\r\nwar of 1710. The first official historian of St.-Omer, a worthy priest\r\nDom Devienne, writing in 1782, gave this legend form. As he transformed\r\nJacqueline from a rich and prosperous woman of affairs into a 'woman of\r\nthe dregs of the people,' calling her Jane, by the way, instead of\r\nJacqueline, she became, after the Revolution, a popular heroine; her\r\nthird husband, who appears to have been a young Squire de Boyaval and a\r\ndashing grey mousquetaire of King Louis, was metamorphosed into a\r\nbrewer's apprentice (Jacqueline among her other possessions owned a\r\nbrewery); and now, in the year 1889 we have the thrifty dame who helped\r\nthe king's officers carry out the king's orders for the supplying of\r\nSt.-Omer, immortalised in bronze as an Audomaraise Jeanne Hachette or\r\nMaid of Saragossa!\r\n\r\n    [2] This is a curious sidelight on English political history. 'Lord\r\n    Bromley' was obviously Sir William Bromley, M.P., the bitter enemy\r\n    of Marlborough, who earned the undying hatred of the Duchess by\r\n    comparing her to Alice Perrers, the mistress of Edward III. In 1705\r\n    Harley prevented the election of Bromley as Speaker by re-publishing\r\n    an account of the 'Grand Toure' written by him, and foisting into it\r\n    notes intended to show that Bromley was a 'Papist.' Bromley was\r\n    again a candidate for the same office in 1710, and Marlborough\r\n    evidently hoped to get from St.-Omer documentary proof of the\r\n    'papistry' of his foe. The second Duchess of Hamilton came, I think,\r\n    of a Catholic family, and may have thought she had a clue to these\r\n    documents. The intrigue, however, failed, and Bromley was elected\r\n    Speaker without opposition in November, 1710.\r\n\r\nIs not this worthy to stand on record with Sir Roger de Coverley's tale\r\nof the old coachman who had a monument in Westminster Abbey because he\r\nfigured on the box of the coach in which Thomas Thynne of Longleat was\r\nbarbarously murdered by Count Konigsmark?\r\n\r\nThe Republican Mayor of St.-Omer took sides on the question of\r\nJacqueline Robins in 1885 with the Republican 'Professor of History in\r\nthe Lyceum,' both of them being 'officers of the Academy,' against the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries; and I dare say the matter may affect the\r\nParliamentary elections in September, 1889!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nIN THE PAS-DE-CALAIS--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n  AIRE-SUR-LA-LYS\r\n\r\nIt is a local tradition at Aire-sur-la-Lys that, about half a century\r\nago, the good people of this ancient and picturesque town (which, like\r\nSt.-Omer, remained a part of the Spanish dominions when all the rest of\r\nthe Artois became French by the treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659) turned\r\nout with flags and music to welcome their mayor back from Paris,\r\nbringing the good news that the projected Northern railway should not\r\npass through their territory, to disturb their settled trade.\r\n\r\nThis unique incident is often cited to show the tenacious conservatism\r\nof the Artesians. I believe, however, it only proves that the people of\r\nAire, dwelling in a region which has been fought over from time\r\nimmemorial, had a well-grounded objection to the exclusively military\r\nviews with which Marshal Soult then desired that the Government of Louis\r\nPhilippe should take up and carry out the projected enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt all events, Aire-sur-la-Lys now rejoices in a comfortable little\r\nrailway station, which makes it an important point in the system of the\r\nNorthern Railway of France.\r\n\r\nThere, on a lovely evening in June, I found the carriage of M. Labitte,\r\none of the Councillors-General of the department, waiting to take me to\r\nhis charming and hospitable home in the richly-cultivated agricultural\r\ncommune of St.-Quentin.\r\n\r\nIt was on the eve of Pentecost when, as the German poet tells us, 'the\r\nwoods and fields put off all sadness,' and a lovelier summer evening it\r\nwould be hard to find even in England.\r\n\r\nM. Labitte is a Conservative and a devout Catholic. As I have already\r\nmentioned, he was a candidate in the Pas-de-Calais in 1886 for the seat\r\nin the Chamber now held by M. Camescasse, and received 74,554 votes\r\nagainst 86,356 for his opponent. In Aire he was beaten by only 22 votes\r\nout of a total of 3,536. His influence in the country here is, in a\r\ncertain sense, hereditary, for he came of a family which in the last\r\ncentury gave many excellent ecclesiastics to the service of the Church,\r\namong a population then, as now, remarkable for its strong religious\r\nfeeling. When the States-General were convened by Louis XVI. a century\r\nago, the first date fixed for the elections in Artois had to be\r\npostponed, at the request of the Duc de Guines, because it interfered\r\nwith Easter. The Artesians cared more for the Church than for the State.\r\nYet, in no part of France was the calling of the States-General more\r\npopular, and nowhere were more efforts made before 1789 than in Artois\r\nto improve the condition of the people and to secure a more just and\r\nliberal fiscal administration. The clergy were extraordinarily powerful\r\nin Artois, alike by reason of their property and of the religious\r\ndisposition of the people; and it is a curious and interesting fact that\r\nunder the constitution of the Estates of Artois it was established\r\n(thanks to the union of the clergy with the Third Estate) that, while no\r\nvotes of the nobility and the clergy united should bind the Third\r\nEstate, any joint vote of the Third Estate with either of the other two\r\norders should bind them all. Here, long before the much-bewritten date\r\nof 1789, we have the Church in Artois arraying itself on the side of the\r\ntax-paying people against the privileged classes. Modern inquiries show,\r\nindeed, that this was the attitude of the great body of the French\r\nclergy long before what is called the 'Revolution.' The majority of the\r\nrepresentatives of the clergy in the States-General of 1789 did not wait\r\nfor the theatrical demonstrations in the Tennis Court of Versailles,\r\nabout which so much nonsense has been talked and written, to join the\r\nThird Estate in insisting upon a real reform of the public service. No\r\nFrench historian has ventured to make such a picture of the Catholic\r\nclergy of France under the Bourbons as Lord Macaulay thought himself\r\nauthorised to paint of the Protestant clergy of England under the\r\nStuarts. There were flagrant scandals among the higher orders of the\r\nChurch in France, no doubt, as there were in England. The names of\r\nDubois, of Loménie de Brienne, of De Rohan are not associated with the\r\ncardinal virtues. De Jarente, Bishop of Orleans, driving Mdlle. Guimard\r\nto the opera in his coronetted and mitred coach, is not an edifying\r\nfigure, nor is Louis de Grimaldi, Bishop of Mans, saying Mass in his red\r\nhunting-coat and breeches. But the Protestant Dean of St. Patrick's\r\nthought the execution for felony of another Protestant dean a capital\r\ntheme for a merry ballad; and at the end of the eighteenth century\r\nArthur Young painted the English rural clergy in very dark colours. The\r\ncurates, the rectors, the monks of France as a body, showed under the\r\nold régime the same qualities of devout faith and Christian sympathy\r\nwith the people with which they met and baffled their persecutors after\r\nthe crash of the monarchy. The three representatives of the clergy who\r\nfirst struck hands with the Third Estate on June 13, 1789, were curates\r\nsent to Paris by a province more intensely Catholic than Artois. They\r\nwere Poitevin priests from the region which we now know as La Vendée,\r\nand which only four years afterwards rose in arms to defend its altars\r\nand its homes against the intolerable despotism of the 'patriots' of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nWhen Turgot was put in charge of that work of fiscal reform which might\r\nhave spared France the horrors and the disasters of the Revolution, had\r\nLouis XVI. been capable of standing even by Turgot to the end, he\r\ncarried on an extensive correspondence with curates in Artois as well as\r\nin the other provinces of France, as the best means of educating the\r\npeople to an intelligent appreciation of his purposes and of his plans.\r\nCondorcet, who treated the brutal murderers of the Duc de la\r\nRochefoucauld with a complaisance which entitles him to the confidence\r\nof the most advanced anti-clerical philosophers of our own day, bears\r\nwitness to the good intentions of Turgot's correspondents. He says, in\r\nhis memoir of Turgot, printed at Philadelphia seven years before the\r\nRevolution of '89, that 'the curates, accustomed to preach sound morals,\r\nto appease the quarrels of the people, and to encourage peace and\r\nconcord, were in a better position than any other men in France to\r\nprepare the minds of the people for the good work it was the intents of\r\nthe ministers to do.'\r\n\r\nWhat was true of the French curates a hundred years ago is true of them\r\nto-day, the duties prescribed to them by the Church being still\r\nprecisely what they were when Condorcet bore this testimony to the good\r\ndispositions of men much more conscientious than himself. Then, too, as\r\nnow, the curates were required to look carefully after the education of\r\nthe children in their parishes. France is indebted, not to the\r\nRevolution, but to a great Protestant historian and statesman, Guizot,\r\nand to King Louis Philippe for the foundation of her system of public\r\neducation. The revolutionists of 1789 left the country worse off in this\r\nmatter than they found it. The royal ordinance of Louis XIV. in 1698,\r\nwhich required the establishment of schoolmasters and schoolmistresses\r\nin every parish in which they were not then to be found, and fixed the\r\nsalaries to be paid these masters and mistresses out of a public tax in\r\nevery parish in which no foundations for their support existed, was\r\ndistinctly a public-school law. This ordinance made it incumbent upon\r\nall parents and other persons who had charge of children to send them to\r\nthe schools until they were fourteen years of age, and it also enjoined\r\nupon the curates the duty of 'watching with particular attention over\r\nthe education of the children in their respective parishes.' The spirit\r\nin which the clergy of Artois, at least, discharged this duty appears in\r\nan ordinance of the Bishop of Arras issued in 1740, half a century\r\nbefore the Revolution of 1789, in which the bishop lays it down as a\r\nmaxim that 'the greatest charity which can be shown the poor is to\r\nensure them the means of obtaining an education.'\r\n\r\nThis, down to thirty years ago, was the principle of legislation in\r\nVirginia upon the public school question, the State not attempting to\r\ninterfere with the authority of parents over their children in the\r\nmatter of education, but making an appropriation for the instruction of\r\nthe children of the poor. That mischievous wind-bag Lakanal lived in\r\nMississippi and Louisiana during his exile in America, and it is\r\npossible that his influence may have had something to do with the early\r\nadoption by another southern State, Louisiana, of the general public\r\nschool system. However that may be, Louisiana in 1850 spent upon her\r\npublic schools three times as much money annually as any of the New\r\nEngland States, with the result that, out of a native white population\r\nof 186,577, she had in her prisons 240 native white criminals, or 1 in\r\n777 of the whole number, being 'the largest proportion of criminals to\r\npopulation at that time to be found in America, if not in the world.'\r\nVirginia, out of a native white population of 1,070,395 in 1860, had no\r\nmore than 163 native white criminals in her prisons, or 1 in 6,566 of\r\nher native white population.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, by the way, that but for the fidelity of the\r\nFrench clergy before 1789, in carrying out the work imposed upon them by\r\nthe ordinance of Louis XIV., and commended in the ordinance of the\r\nBishop of Arras in 1740, two of the most conspicuous actors in the\r\ngrotesquely horrible drama of the French Revolution would have starved\r\nto death in the streets of Arras, or grown up there in vagabondage. The\r\nclergy of St.-Vaast in the diocese of Arras found, in 1768, two wretched\r\nurchins thrown upon the world by an unnatural father. One of these,\r\nMaximilian Isidore de Robespierre, was born in 1758; the other, Augustus\r\nBai Joseph de Robespierre, in 1764. The good priests picked them up,\r\ncared for them, and put them in the way of getting a good education,\r\nwhich they turned to such purpose that both of them eventually came to\r\nthe guillotine in the flower of their years, and amid the cordially\r\ncontemptuous execrations of decent people all over the world. One of the\r\nmost accomplished public men in Massachusetts told me years ago, that he\r\nwas stopped on his way to school one morning in 1794, by a friend of the\r\nfamily, who bade him run back at once and tell his father the news had\r\ncome from Europe that 'the head of Robert Spear had been cut off.' 'Make\r\nhaste,' said this gentleman, 'and your papa will give you a silver\r\ndollar, he will be so glad to hear it!'\r\n\r\nIt was rather instructive to think of the 'sea-green incorruptible' and\r\nhis idiotic 'Feast of the Supreme Being' on that beautiful clay of\r\nPentecost, in the charming rural commune of St.-Quentin, the peace and\r\nhappiness of which was for a time so cruelly broken up by his atrocities\r\nand follies a hundred years ago. The fine old church, near by my host's\r\nresidence, has been restored with great taste and good sense. It was\r\ncrowded at early mass with the farmers and their families, many of the\r\nmen wearing their blouses, but all well-to-do, for this region is one of\r\nthe richest and best cultivated districts of Northern France. The\r\nservice was celebrated with much simplicity, but with no lack of due\r\nceremony; the singing was excellent; and the priest's homily, a brief\r\nand very good discourse on the spirit of Christian charity, was listened\r\nto with great attention.\r\n\r\nThe pretty custom prevails here, as in Normandy, of handing about in the\r\ncongregation, at a certain point in the service, a basket of bread. Two\r\ngravely courteous old peasants presented the baskets in turn to all the\r\npeople. The service over, the farmers stood and chatted together in\r\ngroups in the churchyard and about the porch, and I heard much talk of\r\nthe outlook for the crops, of the price of cattle, and of certain\r\nproperties which had recently changed hands. Of politics next to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nMy host was for many years a notary at Aire. He has transferred this\r\nposition now to the husband of his only daughter, and occupies himself\r\nmainly with his agricultural interests. The notary, who is a personage\r\neverywhere in France, is especially a personage in Artois. This has come\r\nabout in part through the great changes which have taken place in the\r\nproprietorship of land in this province during the last three centuries.\r\nTowards the end of the seventeenth century, after the province was\r\nsubstantially united with France by Louis XIV., great numbers of small\r\nproprietors, who had done well enough under the Spanish rule, found\r\nthemselves forced, by the pressure of taxation, to part with their\r\nland, and there was a marked increase in the great estates, not only of\r\nthe clergy but of the laity. After the First Consul took the country in\r\nhand, and began to reorganise it socially, on the principle laid down by\r\nhim so often and so energetically, in his dealings with his councillors,\r\nthat 'true civil liberty in a State depends upon the absolute safety of\r\nproperty,' there began to grow up in Artois a great middle class of\r\nlandholders, corresponding in many conditions to the 'strong farmers' of\r\nIreland. With the increase of this class came a natural increase in the\r\nimportance and influence of the notaries, already and through the\r\nSpanish traditions very considerable in this region. In many parts of\r\nthe province the notary is recognised as an unofficial, but\r\nauthoritative, social arbiter, to whom may be safely referred for\r\nsettlement all sorts of disputes, including very often questions of\r\nproperty which would elsewhere be taken before the courts of law. It was\r\npleasant to see that the relation thus established between M. Labitte\r\nand the people generally had not been affected by the political\r\nagitation of the last ten years. When I drove about the country with\r\nhim, I observed that he was saluted everywhere in the friendliest\r\nfashion, and that, as he more than once told me, by persons politically\r\nquite hostile to his re-election as councillor-general.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon on Pentecost, a most interesting ceremony took place at\r\nSt.-Quentin. A long procession made up of the inhabitants of the\r\ncommune, the men wearing their best clothes, the young girls garlanded\r\nand dressed in white, set forth from the porch of the church, after a\r\nbrief service there, and marched around the commune. It was the English\r\nbeating of the bounds without the beating, and with the old religious\r\nrites. In the midst of the procession, which extended perhaps a quarter\r\nof a mile, the parish priest walked alone under an embroidered canopy\r\nborne up by young villagers. Acolytes, with lighted candles, moved on\r\neither side of the canopy. Before it was borne a white silk banner of\r\nthe Virgin, and behind it a banner embroidered in gold. All the park and\r\ngrounds of M. Labitte lying within the commune, and being thrown open to\r\nthe people, a very beautiful altar of verdure and roses had been set up\r\nunder a bower in the great garden behind the house, by the daughter of\r\nM. Labitte. Before this altar the procession paused, a brief service was\r\nperformed there, and then the long line resumed its march, a chorus of\r\nsome twenty male voices chanting, as it went, the Magnificat. Nothing\r\ncould exceed the unaffected simplicity and seriousness of the people of\r\nboth sexes and of all ages. The day was one of those perfect days,\r\nwhich, as Mr. Lowell says, come to the world in June, if ever they come\r\nat all; and as the long line wound its way around the fields, green with\r\nthe prospering crops, beneath the orchards and the groves, and between\r\nthe fragrant hedgerows, the silvery chiming of the bells in the old\r\nchurch alternated with the far-off chanting of the choristers, and the\r\nfitful breeze brought us, from time to time, the grave deep voice of the\r\npriest reciting, as he moved, the ancient prayers of hope and of\r\nthanksgiving.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to remember that under the first French attempt at a\r\nrepublic, this lovely rural spectacle would have been as impossible as\r\nit would be to-day under the rule of the Mahdi in the Soudan; and also,\r\nto reflect that France is governed to-day by men who dream of making it\r\nthus impossible once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nIN THE PAS-DE-CALAIS--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n  AIRE-SUR-LA-LYS.\r\n\r\nMy host at St.-Quentin being a councillor-general, his term of office\r\nexpires with the elections fixed to take place on July 28. There is no\r\nreason in the nature of things why councillors-general should be elected\r\non the same lines with deputies and senators. On the contrary, it would\r\nseem to be very desirable that local rather than national considerations\r\nshould govern the election of such functionaries. But it has been found\r\ndifficult, even in England and Wales, to keep national party politics\r\nout of the election of the new county councillors, whose duties are\r\nmodelled in some important respects upon those assigned to the\r\ncouncillors-general in France; and it is evident that the French local\r\nelections in July will be largely determined by considerations affecting\r\nthe national elections which must take place in September and October.\r\nM. Labitte, who was elected a councillor-general by the Conservatives in\r\nthis department six years ago, was defeated in 1886, as I have already\r\nsaid, in a by-election, held to fill a vacancy in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. It is the wish of his party friends that he should offer\r\nhimself as a candidate for re-election as a councillor-general on July\r\n28; but he does not seem disposed to do this, preferring, I think, to\r\nkeep himself quite free to do his very best to bring about a\r\nConservative victory in the national elections in September, with the\r\nimportance of which to the future of France he is deeply impressed.\r\nMeanwhile, he is giving a personal account of his stewardship as a\r\ncouncillor-general to his constituents in a series of 'conferences.' One\r\nof these conferences he was good enough to invite me to attend.\r\n\r\nIt was held in a commune, distant some ten or twelve miles from\r\nSt.-Quentin-par-Aire, and, as the custom of France is, it was held on a\r\nSunday afternoon. M. Labitte's son-in-law drove out from Aire with his\r\nwife to dine and spend the evening with us. And about three o'clock M.\r\nLabitte, his son-in-law, and myself set out for the conference. Our road\r\nlay through a level but richly cultivated and, in its way, very\r\nbeautiful region. In the last century, Artois seems to have been a kind\r\nof Ireland. The climate was excessively damp, the lack of forests and\r\nthe undeveloped coal-mines left the peasantry dependent upon turf and\r\npeat for fuel; the roads were few and bad. There were good crops of\r\ngrain; but the Intendant Bignon, drawing up a report on the province at\r\nthe close of the seventeenth century, for the Duke of Burgundy, tells us\r\nthe wars had made an end of all the manufactures, including the\r\nlong-famous tapestry-works of Arras. 'There were few fruit-trees, little\r\nhay, and little manure.' Here and there some linen was made; but the\r\ntrade of the province was carried on almost exclusively in grain, hops,\r\nflax, and wool. Iron and copper utensils, and coal and slates came to\r\nArtois from Flanders, cod-fish and cheese from the Low Countries, butter\r\nand all kinds of manufactured goods from England. Yet the population\r\nsteadily increased all through the eighteenth century, while it was\r\nfalling off in the neighbouring provinces of France. The worthy\r\nintendant thought the people sadly wanting in 'intelligence, activity,\r\nand practical sense,' and seems indeed, like a Malthusian before\r\nMalthus, half-inclined to attribute the phenomena of increase and\r\nmultiplication in Artois to these defects. It would surprise him, I\r\nfancy, to look on the people and the land of Artois to-day. The land has\r\nbecome one of the most fertile and prosperous regions of France; the\r\npeople, unaffected to any appreciable extent by immigration, and\r\nunchanged alike in race and in religion, increase and multiply as of\r\nold. The well-tilled fields, the well-kept and beautiful roads, the\r\nneat, green hedgerows, the orchards bear witness on every side to the\r\nintelligence, the activity, the practical sense of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nM. Baudrillart in one of his invaluable treatises on the condition of\r\nFrance before the Revolution of 1789, gives us the main key of this\r\ngreat difference between the condition of agricultural Artois in the\r\neighteenth century and its condition to-day. He cites a most curious\r\nappeal to the estates of Artois in behalf of the rural populations, from\r\nwhich it appears that the citizens of the chief towns had combined with\r\nthe _noblesse_ and the higher clergy to keep the village curates and the\r\nfarmers out of the provincial assemblies, and to throw the whole burden\r\nof taxation upon the agriculturists. 'The soil of Artois,' say the\r\nauthors of this appeal, 'is quite as good as the soil of England; and\r\nyet the Artesian farmers can only get out of their labour on it one\r\nquarter as much as the English do.' It was the fiscal maladministration,\r\nthey maintain, which checked the progress of agriculture and depressed\r\nthe condition of the farmers; and it is interesting to observe that\r\nthese rural reformers proposed to remedy the evils of which they\r\ncomplained, not by abolishing all the privileges of the privileged\r\nclasses in a night, as did the headlong mob of the States-General at\r\nParis in 1789, but by securing a fairer representation of the rural\r\nregions in the Provincial Estates, limiting the duration of the\r\nProvincial Parliaments to three years, and deciding that one-third of\r\nthe seats should be vacated and refilled every year. This does not look\r\nas if the Artesians of the last century were particularly deficient\r\neither in intelligence or in practical sense.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the conference we saw several sugar factories, most of\r\nthem now abandoned, though the beet crops of Artois are still very\r\nimportant; and my companions told me that the people here, with all\r\ntheir traditional conservatism, are very quick to abandon any industry\r\nwhich ceases to promise good returns, and to change their crops as the\r\nconditions of the market change. We saw but few châteaux. One of the\r\nmost considerable, standing well in view from the road in the midst of\r\nan extensive park, and approached by a long avenue of well-grown trees,\r\nseemed to be shut up. The proprietor, the Count de----, I was told had\r\nnot visited it for two years past, one of his gamekeepers having been\r\nmurdered in a conflict with some poachers.\r\n\r\nUnder the existing laws in France, political conferences must be held\r\nwithin four walls. Trafalgar Square meetings would be as impossible in\r\nrepublican France as in monarchical Germany. As the commune in which M.\r\nLabitte was to meet his constituents possesses no convenient hall, and\r\nthe local authorities were not particularly eager to facilitate the\r\nconference, one of the local Conservatives, a well-to-do farmer, had\r\ntaken it upon himself to provide, at his own expense, a proper place of\r\nmeeting, by fitting up a fine large barn with seats, and putting up a\r\nsimple rustic platform in one corner of it for the speaker. It struck me\r\nthat this was a symptom of genuine interest in the politics of his\r\nregion not likely to be shown in similar circumstances by many English\r\nor American farmers. He was a man of middle age, with the quiet,\r\nself-possessed carriage, general among his class in all parts of France,\r\nand received us, in the large and neatly-furnished best room of his\r\nold-fashioned and very comfortable house, with frank and simple\r\ncourtesy. On the walls hung a number of engravings and two or three\r\nsmall paintings. One of these represented the Duc d'Orléans, the father\r\nof the Comte de Paris, in the uniform of the celebrated corps of\r\nChasseurs which he organised and to which he gave his name. 'That\r\npicture,' said the farmer, 'was given to my father by the prince. He\r\nused to stop here often while he was at the camp of the Chasseurs, and\r\ntake his breakfast. I remember him perfectly, for I was then a\r\nwell-grown lad, and he was always full of kindness and good spirits. Ah!\r\nif he had lived! We should not be where we are to-day in France, with\r\nall these debts and all these dangers!'\r\n\r\nThe constituents of my host, all of them specially invited by letter to\r\nattend the conference, had already begun to assemble when we arrived,\r\nbut some of them had two or three miles to walk after service in their\r\nrespective churches, and it was nearly six o'clock when the conference\r\nbegan. By that time the large farmyard and the rooms of the house were\r\nfilled with a company of perhaps a hundred and fifty men, almost all of\r\nthem farmers. Among them was only one landowner of the aristocratic\r\nclass, the Comte de----, who had walked over from his château about\r\nthree miles off. He was a type of the old-fashioned French country\r\ngentleman, tall and sinewy, with finely cut features, simply, not to say\r\ncarelessly, dressed, but with an unmistakable air of distinction, and a\r\ncertain peremptory courtesy of manner which would infallibly have got\r\nhim into trouble in the days when, near Baume-les-Dames, Arthur Young\r\nhad to clear himself of the suspicion that he was a gentleman on pain of\r\nbeing promptly hanged from a lantern hook.\r\n\r\nThe seats in the barn once filled, some fifty auditors grouped\r\nthemselves in the farmyard about the wide-open doors of the barn, and M.\r\nLabitte mounted the extemporised platform. The proceedings had to be\r\nsuspended for a few moments as the attention of the audience was\r\nsuddenly drawn to the high road by the galloping past of two generals in\r\nfull uniform, with their staff officers, from St.-Omer. There was no\r\nnomination of a chairman or a secretary, none of the inevitable\r\nformalities of an English or American political gathering. M. Labitte\r\ncalled the meeting to order by the simple process of beginning to\r\naddress it. Nothing could be more direct and business-like than his\r\nspeech. It was exactly what he told his hearers he meant it to be, an\r\naccount of his stewardship as their councillor-general. He said not a\r\nword about the personal aspects of the party conflicts raging in France,\r\nand very little about the national aspects of that conflict. Speaking in\r\na frank conversational way, and referring to his notes only for figures\r\nand dates, he gave his constituents a succinct picture of the effect\r\nupon their own local interests of the policy pursued by the Government\r\nof the Republic. He told them how much of their money had been spent\r\nunder the action of the Council-General during the six years of his\r\nterm, and on what it had been spent, and with what results. If they\r\nliked the picture, well and good; if not, the remedy was in their own\r\nhands at the next election. He had forewarned me to expect nothing\r\ndemonstrative in the attitude of his audience. 'They listen most\r\nattentively,' he said, 'but they give you no sign either of agreement\r\nor disagreement, of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. At night, after the\r\nmeeting is over, they will break up into little knots and coteries, and\r\ntalk it all over among themselves. If they are pleased on the whole, one\r\nof the group finally will say: \"Well, Labitte told us the truth,\" and\r\nthat being admitted by the rest, the conference will be a success!'\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the auditors were much more outspoken during the\r\nconference. Speaking of the unequal pressure upon the different communes\r\nof the military service, M. Labitte told them a story of a youth who\r\ncame to him to get an exemption from service. 'I told him,' said M.\r\nLabitte, 'that I should be very glad to get it for him, but that his\r\ncommune was not at that moment entitled to an exemption, and that I\r\ncould not be a party to putting an injustice upon another commune. He\r\nwas annoyed at this, and thought I ought to do him a favour, no matter\r\nat whose cost. I declined, and he went away. Some time after I met him,\r\nwhen he exultingly told me that he had seen one of my colleagues, a\r\nRepublican, and had got from him the exemption he wanted. After that I\r\nheard stories put about to the effect that Labitte cared nothing about\r\nthe pressure of the military service on the labouring people! Was I not\r\nright? Was it not my duty to see no favouritism shown to one commune at\r\nthe expense of another?'\r\n\r\nTo these queries there was a prompt and general response, 'Yes! yes! You\r\nwere quite right,' and several voices cried out, 'Bravo!--quite right,\r\nLabitte.'\r\n\r\nAgain, in dealing with the question of education, M. Labitte told his\r\nhearers of three instances in which small communes had been made to\r\nexpend sums inordinately disproportionate to their resources upon what\r\nhe called 'scholastic palaces,' although a great majority of the people\r\nin each instance distinctly refused to send their children to the lay\r\nschools established in these 'palaces.' One case was that of a commune\r\nof some seven hundred souls compelled to expend more than sixty thousand\r\nfrancs, or 2,400_l._ sterling, upon a 'scholastic palace'! 'I opposed\r\nthese expenditures,' he said, 'for I think it is part of the duty of a\r\ncouncillor-general to look closely into the use made of your money.'\r\n\r\nThis, also, the hearers applauded, not noisily at all, but with a kind\r\nof gratified murmur, not unlike the very loud purring of a very large\r\ncat. By this time it was evident that the speaker had his audience well\r\nin hand, and M. Labitte took up some points of attack made on himself.\r\nOne of these was that he was a 'clerical.' He said that he certainly was\r\na 'clerical,' if that meant a man who had a religion and respected it,\r\nand wished to see the religion of other people respected; and gliding on\r\nfrom this to the question of the religious education of children, he\r\nasked the people whether they wished to see the curates forbidden to\r\nteach their children the principles of their religion. He was instantly\r\nanswered by a man standing in the crowd just outside the door of the\r\nbarn, who, in a loud and rather husky voice, shouted out that 'the\r\npriest had no business in the school.' Several of the audience met this\r\ninterruption with derisive laughter, and two or three of them sharply\r\ninvited the man to hold his tongue and go about his business. For a\r\nmoment it seemed as if we were about to have a scene. But M. Labitte\r\ninterposed. With perfect good temper he replied to the man that he was\r\nquite of his opinion as to the proper place of a priest, and that he had\r\nno wish to see the children at school interfered with in their school\r\nhours by any instruction not a part of the school programme. He\r\nsuggested, however, that, instead of shouting and clamouring, the man\r\nshould wait till he, M. Labitte, had got through, and then come up\r\n'amiably and prettily' on the platform and state his own views as fully\r\nas he liked. This made the man in the doorway angrier than ever, and as\r\nthe audience good-naturedly laughed at him, he began to use rather\r\nabusive language. Upon this several stalwart peasants rose and made\r\ntheir way towards him with very plain intimations that if he did not\r\ntake to the highway he would be carried there. The uproar was all over\r\nin five minutes. Some companions of the anti-clerical gentleman, not\r\nliking the look of the audience, contrived to surround him and led him\r\noff, and he disappeared uttering a threat or two of incoherent defiance\r\nas he went out of the farmyard. A burly farmer seated near me explained\r\nthat 'the fellow was drunk. But,' he added, 'he was sent here to do all\r\nthis, and I know who sent him. Do you see that high chimney across the\r\nroad some way off among the trees? Well, he is a factory hand there.\r\nThere are a number of them--they don't belong to this country, and the\r\nmanufacturer is an intriguer. He wanted to be a councillor-general, and\r\nwe beat him off. He doesn't like it--and that's at the bottom of it\r\nall.'\r\n\r\nM. Labitte spoke for about an hour, the audience gradually increasing\r\nand listening with close attention. At the end the farmer, who had\r\narranged the conference, got up and thanked the councillor-general for\r\nthe account he had given of his services, and then the meeting broke up\r\nas quietly as it had assembled, and with as little ceremony.\r\n\r\nBefore the company began to leave the barn, a young man near the door\r\nasked for some information as to the duties likely to be imposed to\r\nprotect the farmers, and getting a brief and clear reply, he said that\r\nwould be very satisfactory--if only 'some proprietors would not put such\r\nhigh prices on their land.' The Count, who sat just in front of me and\r\nwho had kept his hawk eye fixed on the speaker, chuckled to himself and\r\nsaid to me, 'That shot was meant for me!'\r\n\r\nAltogether the proceedings gave me a very favourable notion of the\r\nintelligence and the practical sense of the people. If all the\r\nconstituencies in France could be handled in this direct fashion at the\r\nnational elections in September, the result of those elections might be\r\nat least the approximative expression of the sense of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut this is not to be expected. There is much more canvassing done, I\r\nthink, by legislative candidates in France, and much less public\r\nspeaking than in America or in England, and the pressure of the\r\nGovernment upon the voters is very much greater here even than it is in\r\nAmerica. The proportion of office-holders to the population is much more\r\nconsiderable, and the recent governments have made the tenure of office\r\nin France even more dependent upon the political activity of the\r\nofficials than it has ever been in the United States. This is one of the\r\nmany evil legacies of the First Republic. The maxim that, 'to the\r\nvictors belong the spoils,' I am sorry to say has been pretty\r\nextensively reduced to practice on my side of the Atlantic; but it was\r\nfirst formulated, not by Jackson, but by Danton. Louis Blanc tells us\r\nthat this brutal Boanerges of the Jacobins startled even his allies one\r\nday, by cynically declaring that 'the revolution was a battle, and, like\r\nall battles, ought to end by the division of the spoils among the\r\nvictors.'\r\n\r\nGabriel Charmes, a republican of the republicans, reviewing the conduct\r\nof the governments which have succeeded each other in France with such\r\nkaleidoscope rapidity since the death of Thiers, deliberately declares\r\nthat 'epuration is the watchword, and the true aim of Republican\r\npolitics' in France. And 'epuration' is the euphemism invented to\r\ndescribe the simple process of kicking out the office-holder who is in,\r\nto make room for the office-seeker who is out. Gambetta began this\r\nprocess in December 1870, when he wrote to the Government at Paris:\r\n'Authorise me and all my colleagues to \"purify\" the _personnel_ of the\r\npublic administration, and it shall be done in very short order.' Within\r\na month, the Minister of the Interior telegraphed to the prefects, 'you\r\nare authorised to make all the changes among the public school teachers,\r\nwhich, from a republican and political point of view, you may think\r\ndesirable.' M. Crémieux, Minister of Justice, followed the work up so\r\nenergetically, that by the end of the year 1871 he declared that he had\r\n'weeded out eighteen hundred justices of the peace, and two hundred and\r\neighty-nine magistrates of the courts and tribunals.' When the\r\nrepublicans of the different Radical shades got into power in 1877, the\r\nnewly elected deputies, according to M. Floquet, held a meeting, and\r\ninsisted upon a further 'epuration.' They were of the mind of the\r\nsub-prefect of Roanne, who telegraphed to his superior, 'If Republicans\r\nalone are not put into office, the Republicans will rise and we shall\r\nhave civil war.' In January 1880, M. de Freycinet, then, as now, a\r\nMinister, loudly called for a 'reform of the _personnel_ of the\r\nAdministration; and M. Gabriel Charmes, speaking of the then\r\nsituation in France, tells us that only one prefect of the previous\r\nRepublican Administration had escaped 'purification,' and not one\r\nprocureur-general. 'Has a single justice of the peace,' he added, 'or a\r\nsingle public school teacher in the slightest degree open to suspicion,\r\nescaped the avenging hands of MM. Le Royes and Jules Ferry? Certainly\r\nnot.'\r\n\r\nThis was nine years ago. So thorough was the weeding, M. Charmes tells\r\nus, that, 'even the rural constables had not escaped, and the epuration\r\npolicy had carried terror and anarchy into all branches of the public\r\nservice.'\r\n\r\nIn 1885 more than three millions of voters recorded their protest\r\nagainst these methods of government, and against the deputies who had\r\nidentified these methods with the Republican form of government. This\r\nprotest was met by M. de Freycinet, on January 16, 1886, with a speech,\r\nin the course of which he calmly said, 'Let no one henceforth forget\r\nthat liberty to oppose the Government does not exist for the servants of\r\nthe State.'\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the Republican Government, which is itself the servant,\r\nand the paid servant, of the State, will not permit any of its\r\nfellow-servants and subordinates, who are also presumably French\r\ncitizens and taxpayers, to form and express at the polls any opinion on\r\npublic affairs differing from the opinions held by the ministers who\r\nmake up the Government.\r\n\r\nIt was upon this simple and beautiful principle that Mr. Tweed and his\r\ncolleagues consolidated the local administration of affairs of the city\r\nof New York. Applied to the administration of the affairs of thirty-six\r\nmillions of people in France, it ought certainly to produce results far\r\ntranscending in splendour any achieved by the Tammany Ring. For M.\r\nGabriel Charmes is quite in the right when he says that 'under this word\r\nof \"epuration\" lie concealed the most deplorable forms of personal\r\ngreed, and the least avowable personal spites and rancours.' Like other\r\nclever devices, however, 'epuration' may possibly be carried too far. If\r\nit comes to pass that no actual functionary thinks his head safe, while,\r\nat the same time, every office the Government has to give represents a\r\ndozen or twenty 'expurgated,' and therefore exasperated and disaffected,\r\nprevious holders of that office, the confidence of the garrison may be\r\nshaken while the animosity of the assailants is intensified. This point\r\nmay possibly have been reached in France. If it has not been reached,\r\nthe influence of the Government upon the voters must be very formidable.\r\nFor the average French voter is hemmed in and hedged about by\r\ninnumerable small functionaries who have it in their power to oblige or\r\nto disoblige him, to gratify or to vex him in all sorts of ways; and\r\nthough the ballot is supposed to be sacred and secret in France, it can\r\nhardly be more sacred or more secret there than in other countries. And\r\nwhatever protection against annoyance the ballot may give to the voter,\r\nnothing can protect the candidate.\r\n\r\nWhat I have heard in other regions I hear in Artois, that nothing is so\r\ndifficult as to persuade men of position and character to take upon\r\nthemselves the troubles, and expose themselves to the inconveniences, of\r\nan important political candidacy. There are a hundred ways in which a\r\ntriumphant Administration conducted on the principles of the 'epuration'\r\npolicy may harass and annoy an unsuccessful banner-bearer of the\r\nOpposition. The question of expense is another obstacle in the way of a\r\nthorough organisation of public opinion against such a Government.\r\n\r\nAn average outlay of 400,000 francs per department would be required, I\r\nwas told by an experienced friend in Paris, adequately to put into the\r\nline of political battle all the departments of France, large and small\r\ntogether. As there are eighty-three departments in France, this gives us\r\na total of 33,200,000 francs, or some 1,300,000_l._ sterling, as the\r\ncost of a thorough political campaign against an established French\r\nGovernment. If we suppose each deputy to make a personal contribution of\r\n20,000 francs to this war-chest, that will give us only about one-third\r\nof the necessary amount. The rest must be made up by the personal\r\ncontributions of public-spirited citizens, and my own observation of\r\npublic affairs, going back, now, over a good many lively and interesting\r\npolitical conflicts in the United States, leads me to believe that\r\nliberal contributions of this sort are, as a rule, more easily collected\r\nby the beneficiaries of a more or less unscrupulous Government actually\r\nin power, than by the disinterested advocates of a real political\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\nWe wound up the day of the Conference with a delightful little dinner at\r\nSt.-Quentin. The traditions of the old French _cuisine_ are not yet\r\nextinct in the provinces, nor, for that matter, in the private life of\r\nthe true Parisians of Paris. They all centre in the famous saying of\r\nBrillat-Savarin, that a man may learn how to cook, but must be born to\r\nroast--a saying worthy of the philosophic magistrate who, coming to\r\nAmerica, under the impression that he was to be fed upon roots and raw\r\nmeat, went back to France convinced that a New England roast turkey and\r\nan Indian pudding were not to be matched in the old world. It is one of\r\nthe many curious things of this curious world of the nineteenth century,\r\nthat a _cuisine_ of made dishes of which Grimod de La Reynière long ago\r\ngave us the origin, in the downfall of the kitchens of the\r\nprince-bishops along the Rhine, should be gravely and generally accepted\r\nby Frenchmen themselves, or at least by the Parisians of literature and\r\nthe boulevards, as the national _cuisine_ of France. The charming\r\ndaughter of my host at St.-Quentin knew better; and she received with a\r\ngraceful, housewifely satisfaction the neatly-turned compliments which\r\none of the guests was old-fashioned and sensible enough to pay her upon\r\nthe skill of her cook.\r\n\r\nThe city of Aire-sur-la-Lys itself, like St.-Omer, shows traces still of\r\nits connection with Flanders and with Spain. I do not know if it is true\r\nof Aire as M. Lauwereyns de Roosendaele, writing about Jacqueline\r\nRobins, declares it to be of St.-Omer, that there are people there, even\r\nnow, who think of the days of the Spanish rule as the 'good old times.'\r\nBut there is a certain Castilian stateliness about the older buildings\r\nof Aire; and the portals of the larger residences, leading from the\r\nstreet into charming secluded courts, gay with trees and flowers, remind\r\none of the zaguans of the Andalusian houses. Very Spanish, too, is the\r\nJesuit Church, despite some extraordinary decorations due to the zeal of\r\nits more recent possessors.\r\n\r\nThe Flemish past of the city is commemorated especially by a very\r\nremarkable little building known as the Corps de Garde, and by certain\r\nportions of the Church of St.-Pierre.\r\n\r\nAire formerly had a cathedral, but during the worst period of the Terror\r\nthat exemplary ruffian, Joseph Lebon of Arras, the unfrocked priest, who\r\norganised pillage and massacre throughout the Pas-de-Calais, frightened\r\nthe good people of Aire into a frenzy of destruction and devilry. The\r\nChurch of St.-Pierre was then a collegiate church, but it was turned\r\nover to the worship of the Supreme Being invented by Robespierre,\r\ndesecrated and defaced and left in a deplorable state. It had already\r\nsuffered, like so many other churches all over France and England, from\r\nthe ingenious 'restorers' of the eighteenth century, who have left their\r\nsign-manual on the upper part of the edifice and on the mass of a huge\r\norgan loft which crushes and disfigures the main entrance. The greater\r\npart of the building is of the fifteenth century; and it has been\r\nrestored within our own times as tastefully and effectively as in the\r\ncircumstances was possible, under the supervision and in part, I\r\nbelieve, at the cost of a devoted and conscientious curate, a member of\r\na Scotch family long fixed in Artois, the Abbé Scott, who took charge of\r\nthe church at the end of the reign of Charles X. and who now lies buried\r\nin the building he did so much to preserve. It is a very considerable\r\nchurch, measuring three hundred feet in length and a hundred-and-twenty\r\nin width; with a height of seventy feet in the main nave. The ogival\r\nwindows are filled with rich, stained glass; all the ancient monuments\r\nwhich escaped the fury of 1793 have been excellently restored, and the\r\nchurch bears witness in its condition to the active piety of the\r\nfaithful of Aire.\r\n\r\nThe 'Corps de Garde' is a quadrilateral jewel of Flemish architecture of\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century. It was of old the central point of the\r\ncity, where the armed citizens met who patrolled the streets like the\r\nburghers of Rembrandt's magnificent 'Ronde de Nuit.' A gallery runs\r\nround it of arcades, and brickwork supported by monolithic columns.\r\nAbove these arcades runs a frieze of trophies of arms with the\r\nattributes of St. James--the mayor of the city in whose time it was\r\nbuilt bore the name of this apostle--and the cross of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThe principal façade fronts the 'Grande Place,' and is surmounted by a\r\npicturesque pointed roof. An attic storey, running all around the\r\nbuilding, is richly decorated with sculptures of the Theological and\r\nCardinal Virtues, the Four Elements, and the patron saints of Aire--St.\r\nNicholas and St. Anthony. On another façade is the sculptured niche, now\r\nvacant, wherein stood a statue of the Virgin, before which all the\r\ngreat processions, civic and military, were used to halt and do\r\nobeisance.\r\n\r\nIn 1482, after the death of Charles the Bold, Louis XI. of France\r\nsucceeded, 'by treachery and corruptions,' in annexing Aire for a time\r\nto the French crown, and the local records give a picturesque account of\r\na French tournament held here in 1492, the year of the discovery of\r\nAmerica, under the auspices of no less a person than the Chevalier 'sans\r\npeur et sans reproche.' Pierre du Terrail, dit le Bayard, came to Aire\r\non July 19 in that year, and at once sent a trumpeter to proclaim\r\nthrough all the streets and squares that on the morrow, being July 20,\r\nhe would hold a tournay under the walls of Aire, for all comers, 'of\r\nthree charges with the lance, the steel points dulled; and twelve sword\r\nstrokes to be exchanged, with no lists drawn, and on horseback in\r\nharness of battle.' The next day the combat to be renewed 'afoot with\r\nthe lance until the breaking of the lance, and after that with the\r\nbattle-axe so long as the judges might think fit.' The chroniclers\r\ncelebrate in superlatives the valour and skill shown by the hero in\r\nthese gentle and joyous assaults of arms, and the beauty of the Artesian\r\ndames and damsels who thronged from all the country round into Aire to\r\nwitness the tournay, and take part in the dances and banquets which\r\nfollowed it. But the hearts of the people were evidently Flemish and\r\nSpanish, not French; for they hailed the restoration of the Austrian\r\nauthority by Charles the Fifth with all manner of rejoicings. Charles,\r\nwith his usual sagacity, confirmed all the ancient rights and privileges\r\nof the city and its corporations, which had been a good deal disturbed\r\nunder the centralising rule of the French sovereigns, and a record of\r\nthe year 1538 tells us that on the proclamation in that year of the\r\ntruce of Borny, the Austrian authorities paid the treasurer of the city\r\n'lxxviii. sols' for silver money 'thrown in joy to the people.' The\r\ntreasurer himself seems to have been so enthusiastic on this occasion\r\nthat he threw his own cap after the silver money, for the record adds a\r\nfurther payment to him 'for a certain cap belonging to him, which was\r\nlikewise thrown to the people.' All the records of this age at Aire are\r\npicturesque with lively accounts of all manner of junketings, carousals,\r\nand festivities, and the good people seem to have passed no small part\r\nof their lives in merry-making. There is a curious entry on the occasion\r\nof the marriage of the Archduke Philip to Mary of England. This\r\nauspicious event was celebrated at Aire by a grand procession, followed\r\nby 'songs and ballads in honour of the married pair;' and the treasurer\r\npaid to 'Johan Gallant, goldsmith, iiii. livres iiii. sols for the\r\nsilver presents, to wit, an eagle, a leopard, a lion, and a fool--all in\r\nsilver--which were given to those who made the songs, ballads, and games\r\nin honour of the said good news!'\r\n\r\nLike Calais, St.-Omer, and other cities of this region, Aire offered a\r\nrefuge in 1553 to the unfortunate inhabitants of the ancient historic\r\ncity of Thérouanne, which, after a heroic defence by d'Essé de\r\nMontmorency, was taken in that year, five days after the death on the\r\nramparts of the gallant commander, by the troops of Charles the Fifth,\r\nand by his orders razed to the ground. The details of this merciless\r\ndestruction recall the sack of Rome by the Imperialists; and it is the\r\nblackest feature in the black record of the First French Revolution that\r\nthe men who then got control for a time of the government of France, in\r\nthe names of Liberty and Progress, deliberately and wantonly rivalled\r\nthe most unscrupulous of the kings and emperors whom they were\r\nconstantly denouncing, in their treatment, not of foreign fortresses\r\nconquered in war, but of French cities, of the lives and the property of\r\nFrench citizens, and of the most precious monuments of French history.\r\nCharles the Bold at Dinant and Charles the Fifth at Thérouanne were\r\noutdone, in the prostituted name of the French people, by the younger\r\nRobespierre at Toulon and by the paralytic Couthon at Lyons.\r\n\r\nThe annals of these north-eastern cities of modern France are full of\r\nmost curious and valuable materials for a really instructive history of\r\nthe French people. The most cursory acquaintance with them suffices to\r\nshow how much worse than worthless are the huge political pamphlets\r\nwhich during the last hundred years have passed current with the world\r\nas histories of the French Revolution, and how important to the future,\r\nnot of France alone but of civilisation, is the work begun in our own\r\ntimes by writers like Mortimer-Ternaux, Granier de Cassagnac,\r\nBaudrillart, Biré, and Henri Taine. Here in Artois, under the\r\nconflicting influences of Flemish, Spanish, and French laws and customs,\r\na genuine development of social and political life may be traced as\r\nclearly as in Scotland or in England, down to the sudden and violent\r\nstrangulation of French progress by the incompetent States-General and\r\nthe not less incompetent king in 1789.\r\n\r\nThe archives of Aire show that the question of public education was a\r\npractical question there, at least as far back as at the beginning of\r\nthe seventeenth century. In 1613, the magistrates asked and obtained the\r\npermission of the Archduke Albert and the Archduchess Isabella to lay a\r\nspecial tax on the city of Aire and two adjoining villages, for the\r\npurpose of founding a college, private citizens having already given an\r\nendowment of 750 florins a year for this object. The importance of this\r\ncontribution may be estimated from the fact that after the siege of Aire\r\nby the French in 1641, a sum of I,000 florins left to the Collegiate\r\nChurch of Aire by a canon of Tournay was found sufficient to restore the\r\nchapel of Our Lady, the whole right wing of the church, and many houses\r\nbelonging to the canons, which had all been destroyed by the French\r\nartillery. No time was lost in opening the college to the youth of the\r\ncity and the suburbs, and only a few years afterwards the priests in\r\ncharge of it wrote to the Seigneur de Thiennes, asking for further\r\nendowments in order to increase the number of the teachers to twenty, so\r\ngreat was the affluence of scholars from all the country around, 'to the\r\nnumber at that time of more than three hundred.' The collegiate chapter\r\nof Aire appointed one of its canons superintendent of the school, under\r\nthe title of the 'Ecolâtre.' There really seems to be as little\r\nfoundation in fact for the common notion that there was no provision\r\nmade for the education of the people in France before 1789, as for the\r\nnotion, not less common, that there were no peasant proprietors in\r\nFrance before 1789. It is hardly excusable even that Mr. Carlyle,\r\nrhapsodising more than fifty years ago about the 'dumb despairing\r\nmillions,' should have fallen into this error. For though De Tocqueville\r\nand Taine had not then exploded it in detail, Necker, in whose career\r\nCarlyle took so much interest, not only declared officially that there\r\nwas 'an immense number' of such proprietors in France, but took the\r\ntrouble to explain how it had come about. The law of 1790 establishing\r\nthe land-tax required every parish to furnish a detailed account of the\r\nthen existing properties in land, and it is shown by these that there\r\nthen existed in France nearly two-thirds as many landholders as now\r\nexist, although the population of the country is now about twenty-five\r\nper cent. greater than it then was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nIN THE SOMME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AMIENS\r\n\r\nBy turns English, French, and Burgundian, Upper Picardy, of which Amiens\r\nwas the capital, became definitely French under the astute policy of\r\nLouis XI. The Calaisis and the Boulonnais, with Ponthieu and Vimieu,\r\neventually constituted what was called Lower Picardy, and the whole\r\nprovince, divided under the Bourbons into the two 'generalities' of\r\nAmiens and Soissons, formed before 1789 one of the twelve great\r\ndepartments of the monarchy, and was brought under the domain of the\r\nParliament of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe city of Amiens, associated now, I fear, chiefly, in the English and\r\nAmerican mind, with 'twenty minutes' stop' on the way between Calais and\r\nParis, and with a buffet which perhaps entitles it to be called the\r\nMugby Junction of France, is really one of the most interesting of\r\nFrench cities. No student of Ruskin can need to be told that its\r\nglorious cathedral makes it one of the most interesting, not of French\r\nonly, but of European cities; and two or three excellent small hotels\r\nmake it a most comfortable as well as a most instructive midway station,\r\nnot for 'twenty minutes,' but for a couple of days, between the capitals\r\nof England and France. Arthur Young found it so a hundred years ago,\r\nwhen he encountered there the illustrious Charles James Fox returning to\r\nLondon from a visit to the Anglomaniac Due d' Orléans, in the company\r\nof a charming 'Madame Fox,' of whom Arthur Young and London had no\r\nprevious cognisance.\r\n\r\nLike Dijon, and Nancy, and Toulouse, and Rennes, and Rouen, Amiens still\r\nwears that 'look of a capital' which is as unmistakeable, if also as\r\nundefinable, as Hazlitt found the 'look of a gentleman' to be. York and\r\nExeter, for example, in England, have this look, while Liverpool and\r\nHull have it not. There are traces of the Spaniards in Amiens, as there\r\nare wherever that most Roman of all the Latin peoples has ever passed,\r\nand the curious _hortillonages_ of Amiens, which may be roughly\r\ndescribed as a kind of floating kitchen gardens, remind one so strongly\r\nof the much more picturesque Chinampas of Mexico as to suggest the\r\nimpression that the idea of establishing them may have come hither by\r\nway of Spain.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, Amiens is a point of no small political interest.\r\nIt is the bailiwick of one of the few really notable men of the actual\r\nRepublican party in France--- M. Goblet--and yet it is one of the\r\nstrongholds of Boulangism. There is an old song, the refrain of which,\r\nas I heard it sung, more years ago than I care to recall, always haunts\r\nme when I visit this ancient city:--\r\n\r\n  Vive un Picard, vive un Picard,\r\n  Quand il s'agit de tete!\r\n\r\nThe Picards have always shown, not only sense, but a kind of stubborn\r\nindependence of character. In the days of anarchy which came upon France\r\nwith the brief but ill-omened triumph of the Girondins, Amiens was the\r\nfirst of the French provincial cities to resist and denounce the too\r\nsuccessful attempt of Danton and the commune of Paris to terrorise\r\nFrance by a skilful abuse of the imbecility of Roland. The authorities\r\nof Amiens were the first to protest against the outrageous pretensions\r\nof the 'commissioners,' who came there with Roland's commissions in one\r\nhand, and the secret instructions of Roland's colleague and master,\r\nDanton, in the other, to pillage the property of the inhabitants under\r\nthe pretence of gathering supplies for the national defence, and to\r\nestablish an irresponsible local despotism under the pretence of\r\nsuppressing 'treason.' To them, in the first instance, belongs the\r\ncredit of compelling Roland to get up before the Assembly on September\r\n17, 1792, and confess that he had 'signed in the council commissions\r\nwithout knowing anything about the commissioners who were to use them;'\r\nand to them, therefore, in the first instance, history is indebted for\r\nthe formal record which shows that the actual fall of the French\r\nmonarchy was followed, and its formal abolition preceded, by the letting\r\nloose upon France of a swarm of scoundrels, who filled 'the prisons with\r\nprisoners as to whom no one knew by whom they were arrested; who gave\r\nover to pillage the treasures accumulated in the Tuileries, and in the\r\nhouses of the emigrant aristocracy; who conveyed away everything which\r\ncould tempt the cupidity of a subaltern, without any record whatever;\r\nand who were delivering over Paris and France to the most absurd folly\r\nand the most insatiable greed.' It was not the fault of Amiens if the\r\nefforts of Mazuyer and Kersaint demanding a law to show 'whether the\r\nFrench nation was sovereign, or the Commune of Paris,' and the sonorous\r\neloquence of Vergniaud denouncing the 'citizens of Paris' as the 'slaves\r\nof the vilest scoundrels alive,' only led in the end to making France\r\nherself for a time the slave of these same 'vilest scoundrels alive.'\r\n\r\nIn more recent times, Amiens received and entertained Gambetta on his\r\nway by balloon from Paris to Tours. I asked the veteran Count Léon de\r\nChassepot, who for years was regularly returned at every election at the\r\nhead of the municipal councillors of Amiens, how the people received\r\nGambetta on that memorable occasion. His answer was that there really\r\nwas no 'reception.' Gambetta came down in his balloon at a little place\r\nsome way off, between Amiens and Montdidier, and when he reached Amiens\r\nhe was too tired and hungry to think of 'receiving' people or making\r\nspeeches. Count Léon de Chassepot had nothing, I believe, to do with the\r\ninvention of the guns which bear his name. But he has a glance like a\r\nrifle-shot, and at fourscore years 'Spring still makes spring in the\r\nmind' of this vivacious veteran. I asked him how Amiens behaved when the\r\nnews came there of the capture of Paris by the revolutionists of\r\nSeptember 4, 1870. Was the new republic hailed with enthusiasm?\r\n'Enthusiasm!' he said scornfully; 'why should it be? The people of\r\nAmiens were thinking of fighting the Prussians, not of upsetting the\r\nGovernment! They received the news with stupefaction, as a matter of\r\nlittle consequence in comparison with the invasion. The disaster of\r\nSedan had afflicted them profoundly. The Empire was popular in Picardy.\r\nAt the municipal elections which took place in Amiens just after the\r\ndeclaration of war--early in August 1870, that is--the Imperialist\r\ncandidates had all been elected by overwhelming majorities. M. Goblet,\r\nnow so prominent in the Republican counsels, made his appearance then as\r\nan anti-governmental candidate, together with M. Petit, the present\r\nRadical mayor of Amiens. M. Goblet got 530 votes, and M. Petit 423. They\r\nwere the leading persons on that side, and the leading persons on the\r\nside of the Government received, respectively, 5,099 and 4,964 votes.\r\nThis being the temper of the good people of Amiens at that time, you\r\nwill understand that they were more astounded than pleased by the\r\nso-called revolution of September in Paris. But they were more patriotic\r\nthan the people of Paris, and they acquiesced in the overthrow of the\r\nGovernment to show a united front to the enemy. He was within striking\r\ndistance of Amiens, by the way, and the boulevardiers unfortunately\r\nthought that Paris was out of his reach.'\r\n\r\nThe first act of the revolutionists of September, it appears, was to\r\ndisorganise as far as they could the public service by removing the\r\nprefects, and putting their own people into place and power. They sent a\r\ncertain M. Lardière down post-haste to Amiens to take the place of the\r\nthen prefect of the Somme, M. de Guigné, and that was all they did to\r\ndefend Amiens!\r\n\r\nIn the course of a pleasant morning spent with M. Ansart, a gentleman of\r\nhigh character and position in Amiens, and with several of his friends,\r\nI heard much that was interesting as to this critical period. The\r\nattitude of the leading men throughout Picardy seems to have been in\r\ncomplete conformity with M. de Chassepot's account of the bearing of the\r\ncity of Amiens. The mayor of a commune not far from Amiens, a marquis\r\nand a leading Imperialist, on getting the news of the political\r\nsomersault executed at Paris, read out the bulletin to the people from\r\nthe mairie, reminded them that the enemy were sure to come into Picardy,\r\nand then exclaimed, 'Well, my friends, since it seems we are in a\r\nrepublic, Long live the Republic!'\r\n\r\nThis was the general feeling of good men everywhere at that time in\r\nFrance. Said one gentleman, a landed proprietor from Brittany, 'Nobody\r\nout of Paris who had a head on his shoulders approved what had been\r\ndone in Paris. But by common consent a great blank credit was opened for\r\nthe Republic all over France. If the Republicans would do their duty to\r\nFrance, not as party men but as patriots, France was ready to accept\r\nthem. It is their own fault, and their fault alone, that the men who\r\nmade this change at Paris went to pieces so fast in the public\r\nestimation. It is the fault of the Republicans, and their fault alone,\r\nthat now, after nearly eighteen years, they are an offence to sensible\r\nand liberal men from one end of France to the other.'\r\n\r\nThe new prefect sent down from Paris turned out to be a wind-bag. By the\r\nmiddle of November it became clear that Amiens must fall into the power\r\nof the enemy. The new prefect launched a ridiculous proclamation,\r\nblazing with adjectives, at the advancing Teutons, and then one fine\r\nnight got out of the way as fast as possible, leaving the city and the\r\ndepartment of the Somme to face the wrath of the not very placable\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\nOn November 28, the Prussians occupied the city, one French officer,\r\nCommandant Vogel, falling at his post, which he refused to surrender.\r\nCount Lehndorff, appointed to be German Prefect of the Somme, came down\r\nupon the people heavily for war contributions, which were raised under\r\nthe management of M. Dauphin, who had been the Imperialist mayor of the\r\ncity ever since 1868, and who has of late years been a conspicuous\r\nRepublican. As peace drew near, Amiens had to borrow five millions of\r\nfrancs, for which M. Dauphin agreed the city should pay M. Oppenheim of\r\nBrussels a commission of 10 per cent., and issued its obligations at\r\n7-1/2 per cent. for fifty years.\r\n\r\nNaturally the Germans are not much liked at Amiens. Count de Chassepot\r\nthinks the Picards in general really want war with Germany. They turned\r\nout very generally during the contest. He commanded a battalion of\r\nNational Guards who turned out in full force, not a man missing, though\r\nthey were armed with wretched old muskets, and perfectly understood what\r\nthat must lead to for them. On making his rounds very early in the\r\nmorning, he found, in an advanced post, at a point of great danger, a\r\npicket, a _sentinelle perdue_, who proved to be one of the most\r\nrespectable men in Amiens, the first president of the Upper Court of the\r\ncity, nearly sixty years of age, doing his duty as a private soldier.\r\n'In a hospital here,' said M. de Chassepot, 'I have six hundred\r\npatients. Every man of them is eager for another turn with the Germans.'\r\n\r\nI was anxious to learn when and how it was that M. Goblet, just now the\r\nleading Republican personage of this part of France, began to appear\r\nconspicuously on the horizon. 'Not till Gambetta's new social strata\r\nbegan to appear,' I was told. This was in 1874. The finances of the\r\ncity, left in a sad condition by the war, had been put into order by the\r\nmunicipal council which was elected during the German occupation in\r\n1871; the public works had been restored, fine barracks built, and a\r\nsufficient number of school-houses. In return for those services the\r\ncouncillors who had rendered them were turned out in 1874, M. Dauphin\r\namong them, by the newly-organised 'Union républicaine.' This put M.\r\nGoblet at last into the council with his ally, M. Petit, the latter\r\nbeing the editor of a Radical journal, the _Progrès de la Somme_, which\r\nthe military governor of Paris had ordered to be suppressed early in\r\n1874, for its attacks on the then President, Marshal MacMahon. In 1876\r\nM. Goblet became mayor of Amiens.\r\n\r\n'The very next year, when the contest began between Gambetta as head of\r\nthe Union of the Left and the President of the Republic, M. Goblet threw\r\nhimself as ex-mayor of Amiens openly on the side of the ex-dictator,\r\nand made such speeches that he was dismissed from his office by the\r\nPresident in June 1877.'\r\n\r\n'Did he like this?'\r\n\r\n'No, he didn't like it at all. As Minister of the Interior, in more\r\nrecent times, M. Goblet has knocked off the heads of a great number of\r\nmayors. But when his own head was knocked off in 1877, he loudly and\r\nscornfully denounced all municipal officers who would stoop to accept\r\ntheir positions from the national government.'\r\n\r\n'In that you have the whole character of M. Goblet,' said another\r\ngentleman. 'I have known him from childhood. He is not a bad man, and,\r\nas you know, he is a man of ability, one of the very few able men to be\r\nfound acting with President Carnot. But he is very vain, very ambitious,\r\nvery excitable. As the associate of Petit, who is a rampant atheist, and\r\nof the anti-clericals generally, he has to pose as an unbeliever; but he\r\nis, in fact, nothing of the sort. His wife is a good woman, and he goes\r\nin great awe of her, which I think to his credit. I think if he felt his\r\nhealth suffering he would go to confession in a quiet way by night, just\r\nas the Gambetta prefect ran away from the Prussians in 1871. When the\r\ngrand funeral of Admiral Courbet took place at Abbeville, and it was\r\nannounced that Monseigneur Freppel would come and deliver the funeral\r\nservice over that noble Christian sailor and patriot, the victim of\r\nFerry, M. Goblet was in a dreadful state of mind. He said to me, \"I\r\nthink I shall not attend the funeral.\" \"Pray why?\" \"Well, I wish to\r\nattend it, but I am sure that Bishop Freppel will say things offensive\r\nto me.\" \"Pray accept my congratulations,\" I replied; \"you really are in\r\ngreat luck that the first orator in France should take the trouble to\r\ncome all the way to Picardy expressly to insult you on such an\r\noccasion!\" So he thought better of it and attended, and his sensible\r\nwife afterwards thanked me for preventing her husband from behaving like\r\na donkey.'\r\n\r\n'An excellent woman, Madame Goblet!'\r\n\r\n'Her husband owes her much, and he has some good friends. Comte de\r\nChassepot prevented him from playing the stupid farce of a Roman son by\r\nsacrificing his father's funeral to a discussion on the laicisation of\r\nthe schools; for, seeing what he had in his mind, Comte de Chassepot\r\nsimply moved an adjournment of the council. His evil genius is M. Petit,\r\nnow a senator, the present mayor of Amiens. I have caught M. Goblet\r\noffering the holy water with his hand behind my back to his wife; but M.\r\nPetit is an outspoken unbeliever, and a very type of the anti-christian\r\ndemagogue.'\r\n\r\nUpon this he told me a story which, as it is certainly typical of the\r\nproceedings taken against religion all over France by functionaries of\r\nM. Petit's way of thinking, I shall set down here.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 all the crosses and stones in the cemetery of the Madeleine at\r\nAmiens set up on graves held by temporary concessions had to be removed\r\nby reason of the lapse of these concessions. The then mayor and\r\nmunicipal council had them sold, and ordered the proceeds to be spent in\r\nerecting a large and beautiful cross with an image of the Saviour, and\r\nan inscription stating that this crucifix was erected in memory of all\r\nthe dead buried in the cemetery whose crosses and tombs had been\r\nremoved. This crucifix, called the 'Calvary of the Poor,' was thus a\r\ntouching monument of the family affection of the poor among the people\r\nof Amiens. Outraged by this symbol, the Radical mayor of Amiens caused\r\nthis Calvary to be dismantled, in the night of November 10, 1880, and\r\nthe crosses to be sawn in pieces and thrown away beyond the limits of\r\nthe cemetery. Surely this is an advance beyond Robespierre, and even\r\nbeyond the senseless Vandalism which solemnly ordered the destruction of\r\nthe tombs of the kings and heroes of France. Even Robespierre, when\r\nCambon made his proposal that the Convention should violate the public\r\nfaith pledged by the Constituent Assembly to the support of the French\r\nclergy by the State in exchange for the seizure by the State of the\r\nproperty of the Church, had sense enough to say, in a letter to his\r\nconstituents opposing the project, that 'to attack religion directly was\r\nto strike a blow at the morals of the people.' I am not surprised to be\r\ntold that, notwithstanding the support given him by the central\r\ngovernment of the Republic at Paris, this worthy mayor has speedily lost\r\npopularity even with his own Radical party, and that in the most recent\r\nelections he barely escaped defeat. 'He is ensconced, though,\r\ncomfortably as senator,' said my shrewd informant, 'and I dare say he\r\nwill see his friend, M. Goblet, turned out of the Chamber! So--what does\r\nhe care? His zeal against the Calvary in Amiens may hurt him with the\r\npoor people upon whose faith and whose affections he tramples; but, like\r\nhis brutal expulsion of the Sisters from their schools and hospitals,\r\nand his truculence towards the religious processions in which the\r\nPicards delight, it recommends him to the clique who have got our poor\r\nFrance into their clutches at Paris, and who pose before all the gaping\r\nworld at the Universal Exposition as friends of Liberty and Progress!'\r\n\r\nThe laicisation of the schools has been pushed forward at Amiens, as\r\nelsewhere. It began under M. Spuller, now Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nwho was made Prefect of the Somme in 1879. M. Goblet, who had then been\r\nmayor for a year, resigned, to become under-secretary in the Ministry of\r\nJustice, and the prefect put M. Delpech in his place. Everything, it\r\nwill be seen, was moved from the centre at Paris.\r\n\r\n'This M. Delpech and his associates,' said one of my informants, 'began\r\nthe laicisation of the boys' schools. They were men who would not think\r\nof picking a man's pocket, but see how they behaved in this business!\r\n\r\n'There were six primary schools at Amiens conducted by the Christian\r\nBrothers. Five of these had always been so conducted, and the sixth for\r\ntwenty years. The Christian Brothers agreed to give up this sixth\r\nschool, M. Petit promising them that, if they did this, they should not\r\nbe disturbed in the others. Very soon this promise was broken, and they\r\nwere turned out of the school of Notre-Dame. Then a charge was brought\r\nagainst one of the brethren of the school of St.-Leu. It was serious and\r\nwent before the Assize Court, where the accused was promptly acquitted.\r\nBut this took time, and while the proceedings were pending, our\r\nadmirable M. Petit sent in a report to the Council recommending that the\r\nBrethren be dismissed from their four remaining schools. On August 26,\r\n1879, the Council adopted this report, and within a week M. Spuller, the\r\nprefect, issued an order of expulsion, \"in obedience,\" as he wrote, \"to\r\nthe resolution of the Municipal Council of Amiens, and to the wishes of\r\nthe population.\"'\r\n\r\nM. Spuller appears to be a true disciple of Robespierre, who, in his\r\nfamous socialistic speech before the Convention, affirming that bread,\r\nmeat, and all provisions are not private, but common, property, laid\r\ndown the maxim that, 'even if the measures proposed as their desire by\r\nthe people are not necessary in the eyes of law-makers, they should be\r\nadopted.' _Civium ardor prava jubentium_ is a moral law for legislators\r\nof this admirable school.\r\n\r\nI should note by the way that these Brethren, thus expelled summarily,\r\nwere refused payment of their already fixed salaries for the month of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nA debate ensuing, the question was finally remitted to M. Jules Ferry,\r\n'Grand Master of the University of France,' who decided that the\r\nsalaries were indeed due and the property of the Brethren, but that, as\r\nthe work could not be done by reason of their expulsion, the salaries\r\nneed not be paid!\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the municipality appraised the school furniture, which had\r\nbeen bought and paid for by the Brethren, and having ascertained its\r\nvalue, decided--that it belonged to the municipality!\r\n\r\nWill my readers think the expression of M. Fleury, an accomplished\r\njournalist of Amiens, to whom I am indebted for these details, at all\r\ntoo vigorous, when he described these proceedings as 'exactly defined in\r\nthe French Dictionary, and in the 379th article of the Penal Code, under\r\nthe word \"theft\"'?\r\n\r\nIn August 1880, on the refusal of the Sisters in charge of the girls'\r\nschool to take their pupils to an 'obligatory festival' during the time\r\nfixed on Sunday for divine service, M. Petit, the municipal Emperor\r\nJulian of Amiens, moved for 'the immediate laicisation of all the girls'\r\nschools in Amiens.' This was too much even for M. Goblet, who, to his\r\ncredit, not only protested but voted against the proposition. It was,\r\nhowever, carried. M. Goblet and six other councillors withdrew,\r\nincluding the mayor, M. Delpech; and M. Petit thus became, by seniority,\r\nmayor of Amiens.\r\n\r\n'When this happened,' said a citizen of Amiens to me, 'and M. Petit was\r\nthus put in charge of the rights and the property of the Sisters, it had\r\nbeen perfectly well known for ten years that, by the Parliamentary\r\nInquest of 1871 into the story of the Commune of Paris, M. Petit had\r\nbeen proved to be the founder at Amiens of the secret society known as\r\nthe \"International,\" and yet he was never prosecuted, and he is now a\r\nsenator of the Republic. How do you expect honest people, who respect\r\nthe ordinary laws of order and civilisation, to support a Republic which\r\naccepts and promotes the members of such a society?\r\n\r\n'On October 2, 1880, this remarkable mayor went in person with a\r\nlocksmith and some others to the communal girls' school of St.-Leu, then\r\nmanaged by the Sisters. The Sisters had been already that day notified\r\nto leave the school-buildings \"the next day.\" M. Petit ordered them to\r\ngo out immediately. They showed the notification and declined to go till\r\nthe next day. The curate of St.-Leu, with his vicar and with a member of\r\nthe board of Churchwardens, came up and protested against this invasion\r\nof the school. \"Show me the documents proving this house to be the\r\nproperty of the municipality,\" said the curate. M. Petit showed no\r\ndocuments, but demanded the keys. The curate refused to give them up. M.\r\nPetit ordered his locksmith to pick the locks, which was done, and then\r\nturning to the curate shouted out, \"As for you, if you are here when the\r\ncommissary comes, I will have you turned out by force.\" Upon this the\r\ncurate, a venerable old man, withdrew.\r\n\r\n'From the school of St.-Leu our local Robespierrot drove to the girls'\r\nschool of St.-Jacques, sprang out of the municipal coach (paid for by\r\nthe public treasury), dashed into the house, and seated himself without\r\na word.\r\n\r\n'One of the Sisters asked him civilly what he wished. \"I wish you to get\r\nout of this house,\" he replied, \"We cannot possibly leave in this way,\"\r\nanswered a Sister who has for years devoted herself to this work. \"I\r\nhave nothing to say to you,\" he cried; \"I want the Superior.\" The\r\nSuperior quietly came and informed the mayor that the church officers\r\nhad told her not to leave, excepting under force. \"Very well, you shall\r\nhave force! If you are not all out of here by Tuesday, I will put you\r\nall into the street!\"\r\n\r\n'Now observe the consequences to the taxpayer of Amiens! The Church of\r\nSt.-Leu, as it happens, owned the greater part of the school-buildings.\r\nThe church began proceedings against the city, and in August 1881, the\r\ntribunal ordered the city to give up the buildings seized by this\r\nadventurous mayor, and to withdraw its lay teachers. The upshot was that\r\nthe performances of M. Petit, in one way or another--although M. Goblet,\r\nthen in the ministry at Paris, came to the rescue of his demagogic\r\nally--cost the taxpayers, in round numbers, some fifty thousand francs.\r\nNow you see why the laicising Republicans are so anxious to shake the\r\nwhole system of the French magistracy. There may be judges at Berlin. It\r\nis not convenient there should be judges in Republican France!'\r\n\r\nThis recalled to me what I heard the other day at Calais about the\r\nfunctionary decorated at Bapaume by President Carnot, because the\r\ntribunal had given a decision against him in a case raised by certain\r\nChristian Brothers whom he had unlawfully put out of property which,\r\nunder the law, belonged to them.\r\n\r\n'You think that a remarkable case!' said the Picard friend to whom I\r\nmentioned it. 'It is an everyday affair. Wait a minute! Let me show you\r\nthe documents in regard to a performance of our worthy mayor and\r\nsenator, which throws President Carnot into the shade. They are as\r\namusing, too, as they are instructive, and I will give you copies of\r\nthem which you may use as you like. You tell me people in England and\r\nAmerica have no idea of what is going on in France? I assure you that\r\npeople in France who know what is going on around them, have no idea of\r\nwhat it all means, or of what it must lead to in the end.\r\n\r\n'Sometimes I think we were so stunned as a nation by the invasion and\r\nthe Commune that we are still staggering about like a man knocked on the\r\nhead in a dark road.\r\n\r\n'But let me tell you the tale of M. Petit and Mademoiselle Colombel.\r\nMademoiselle Colombel was a lay teacher at the head of one of our\r\nschools, the school of the Petit St.-Jean. I don't quite see, by the\r\nway,' he observed, 'why M. Petit and his squad have not changed the\r\nnames of these schools. In Paris, you know, they had the courage to\r\nchange the name of one of the great lyceums into the Lyceum Lakanal. To\r\nbe sure it didn't stay changed very long, for even Paris--which suffers\r\none of its boulevards to commemorate that wretched creature Victor\r\nNoir--wouldn't stand Lakanal. But to infect the minds of children with\r\nthe names of little Saints--surely this is a monstrous thing! Well,\r\nMademoiselle Colombel lost her temper one day, and tried to find it\r\nabout the person of one of her little pupils, with slaps, and pinches,\r\nand other caresses of the kind. She was brought up before the police for\r\nit, and sentenced to pay a small fine with costs. She appealed, but the\r\ncourt confirmed the sentence of the police magistrate, who had acted\r\nstrictly within the law. What followed? This was in May 1885. Mdlle.\r\nColombel declared herself to be a persecuted martyr of \"laicisation,\"\r\nand in that capacity called upon the mayor, M. Petit, for aid and\r\ncomfort. I believe they were old allies in the sacred cause. Be this as\r\nit may, the mayor made himself her champion against the magistrate, and\r\nwrote her, for public use, this letter. Pray print it. It is a great\r\nthing for Amiens to possess a mayor, and for France to possess a\r\nsenator, who can write such a letter. It ought to have been sent to the\r\nExposition.\r\n\r\n     '\"Amiens, May 1885.\r\n\r\n     '\"Madame,--On the strength of calumnious imputations fomented by an\r\n     Ulysses who could not console himself for the departure of Calypso,\r\n     and complacently listened to, you have been prosecuted for cruelty\r\n     to your pupils.\r\n\r\n     '\"After an inquiry as long and as voluminous as if the matter at\r\n     issue had been a case for the Assize Court, this intrigue came to a\r\n     miserable end before a simple police tribunal. From the moment,\r\n     when, through a singular sort of suspicion about your natural\r\n     judges, you were removed from the disciplinary action of your\r\n     superiors, without any preliminary inquiry made by them, and,\r\n     indeed, without apprising them of the matter, you should have been\r\n     taken before the Courts. Nobody seemed to understand this, so you\r\n     were condemned by default to pay a fine, trifling indeed, but so\r\n     imposed as to take from you the right of appeal. Be this as it may,\r\n     since some of the law officers of the Republic are ready to revive\r\n     against the lay instructors of our schools, the methods of the law\r\n     officers of the Empire, it is well your colleagues should know\r\n     that, whilst I am at the head of the municipal administration of\r\n     Amiens, they shall not be given over defenceless to the rancour of\r\n     the clerical world, its dupes, or its accomplices. I have therefore\r\n     the honour to inform you that I not only relieve you from all the\r\n     costs of your case, but that, in order to soothe the trouble it may\r\n     have caused you, I grant you an indemnity of one hundred francs!\r\n\r\n     '\"Against the sentence which condemned you put this proof of esteem\r\n     and sympathy. Honest people and Republicans will think this\r\n     testimony at least as good as any other. Accept, Madame, the\r\n     assurances of my most distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\n      '\"The Mayor of Amiens,\r\n\r\n         '\"FRÉDÉRIC PETIT.\"'\r\n\r\n'Ulysses bewailing the departure of Calypso is charming, is it not?'\r\nsaid my friend. 'M. Petit is a cotton-velvet manufacturer, and his\r\nclassics are cotton classics. But what do you say to the applause of\r\n\"honest people\" acclaiming a mayor who puts his hand into the public\r\ntreasury and makes a present out of it to soothe the injured feelings of\r\na schoolmistress fined by a public tribunal for ill-treating her pupils?\r\nCan you ask for a more flagrant illustration of the state to which this\r\nRepublic is bringing our public services? And the mayor who wrote this\r\nletter, and took this money out of the public treasury, and offered this\r\nopen insult to the tribunals of the city of Amiens, has since then been\r\nmade a senator of the Republic, with the help and concurrence of M.\r\nDauphin, then First President of our Courts, whose plain official duty\r\nit was to revoke his commission as mayor as soon as this letter was\r\npublished! With such men as this in the French Senate do you wonder the\r\ncountry laughs at senatorial courts of justice? I have no great opinion\r\nof General Boulanger, though I have as good an opinion of him as of M.\r\nClémenceau, who invented him. But really is it not grotesque to see such\r\ncotton-velvet senators as this mayor of Amiens going about to decide\r\nquestions of fidelity to public duty? Take my word for it' he continued,\r\n'it is the direct personal knowledge which the people have of just such\r\npersonages as the mayor of Amiens all over France, which makes\r\ntwo-thirds of the popular strength of General Boulanger. If the Senate\r\nand the Government succeed in putting about the impression that General\r\nBoulanger is no better than they are, they will no doubt weaken him with\r\nthe people, but they will not strengthen themselves. This Third Republic\r\nis dying, not of any passion for the monarchy, not even of the\r\nImperialist legend, which is very strong in the country--more because\r\nFrance was so prosperous under the third Napoleon than because France\r\ndominated Europe under the first Napoleon: it is dying of popular\r\ncontempt. It is dying of the Goblets, the Petits, the Dauphins. They are\r\nto be found all over France--under different names--yes--but always the\r\nsame: shallow, vain, vulgar sycophants of universal suffrage while they\r\nare out of place, bullies and traders when they are in power. And then!'\r\nhe exclaimed after a pause, 'what most exasperates me is that they are\r\nsuch a pack of wordmongers, for ever ranting about things which may have\r\nintoxicated our grandfathers in 1792--they don't seem to me to have\r\ninvented gunpowder, our grandfathers!--but which simply make sensible\r\nmen sick to-day.\r\n\r\n'Wait a moment! Let me complete the picture of our model Picard\r\nRepublican senator for you. The Comte de Chassepot told you the story,\r\ndid he not, of the Calvary in the cemetery of the Madeleine? Yes. But he\r\ndid not show you the correspondence about it between the bishop and this\r\ncharlatan of twopenny Atheism? No? Well it is a tit-bit, and I give it\r\nto you! Petit sent his order to the keeper of the cemetery of the\r\nMadeleine in November 1880, to raze the cross, saw off the arms, and\r\ndetach from it the image of Christ. He was then, observe, not really\r\nmayor of Amiens, but only mayor by reason of the refusal of his senior\r\nto serve in the office.\r\n\r\n'The work was done at night. The cross was destroyed. The image of the\r\nSaviour was thrown into a shed.\r\n\r\n'Two days afterwards, the Bishop of Amiens wrote this letter to the\r\nPrefect of the Somme, Spuller, the same person who is now--heaven save\r\nthe mark!--Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French Republic!\r\n\r\n     '\"Amiens: Nov. 12, 1880.\r\n\r\n     '\"Mr. Prefect,--A most deplorable incident--indeed a grave\r\n     scandal--has just taken place at the cemetery of the Madeleine, and\r\n     is exciting, with too much reason, the strongest and most painful\r\n     feelings among the people of Amiens.\r\n\r\n     '\"The figure of our Saviour Christ, set up there in very special\r\n     circumstances, and with a solemn ceremony in which more than 30,000\r\n     spectators took part, was clandestinely thrown down and taken away\r\n     the night before last. It is impossible for me to imagine that the\r\n     authorities can have ordered such a thing to be done.\r\n\r\n     '\"I must request you, Mr. Prefect, to order an inquiry to be made\r\n     into this inexplicable affair, and to cause the authors of the act\r\n     to be prosecuted according to law. Please accept the assurance of\r\n     my respectful regard.\r\n\r\n        '\"[Illustration] AIME VICTOR-FRANCIS,\r\n            '\"Bishop of Amiens.\"\r\n\r\n'To this letter, written by the highest ecclesiastical authority of the\r\nchief city of his préfecture--will you believe it?--M. Spuller, who is\r\nafter all not a perfectly illiterate person like Petit, actually made no\r\nreply!\r\n\r\n'But the cotton-velvet bagman of blasphemy three days afterwards,\r\nreading in the papers the letter of Bishop Guilbert, burst into print\r\nwith this incredible but most instructive effusion, addressed to his\r\nfriend the Prefect:\r\n\r\n     '\"Amiens: Nov. 15, 1880.\r\n\r\n     '\"Mr. Prefect,--I find this morning in the journals of the\r\n     bishopric the text of a letter addressed to you by the Bishop of\r\n     Amiens in regard to the suppression of the Catholic emblem placed\r\n     at the entrance of the general cemetery of the Madeleine.\r\n\r\n     '\"It was by my order, and my written order, that the Christ of the\r\n     Madeleine was removed. The only failure to comply with my orders\r\n     was that the operation was performed in the evening after the\r\n     cemetery was closed, instead of in the morning as I had directed.\r\n     In acting thus, I have shown great tolerance; for, in virtue of\r\n     Article 13 of the Law of the 7th Vendémiaire of the Year IV.,\r\n     circumscribed in its application, but not abrogated by the Law of\r\n     the 18th Germinal year X., as is shown by a ministerial decree of\r\n     the 7th Fructidor following: 'No sign special to any religion can\r\n     be raised, fixed, and attached in any place whatever, so as to\r\n     strike the eyes of citizens, except in an enclosure intended for\r\n     the exercises of this religion, or in the interior of private\r\n     houses, in the studios or warehouses of artists or merchants, or in\r\n     public edifices destined to contain monuments of the arts.\"'\r\n\r\n'Then followed a dozen pages of similar twaddle, meant to show that the\r\nmayor of Amiens was a most tolerant prince, in that he had not ordered\r\nthe destruction of every cross set up on a private grave!\r\n\r\n'Of course all these laws of the First Republic were long ago shot into\r\nspace under the Consulate and the Empire, and of course, even if they\r\nhad not been shot into space, a consecrated cemetery is an \"enclosure\r\nintended for the exercises of religion.\" But what did that signify to M.\r\nPetit, who, in a public speech the year after, boasted that he \"had not\r\nbeen married in church, and that his children had never been baptized.\"\r\n\r\n'Did all this give the man any right to destroy and carry away a costly\r\npiece of artistic work, the property of the city?'\r\n\r\nObviously, it is as absurd to expect peace and order in France under a\r\nrepublic in which men like M. Petit, and M. Spuller, and M. Dauphin, and\r\nM. Goblet are leading friends of the Government, as it would have been\r\nto expect peace and order in the England of the seventeenth century,\r\nwhen churchwardens--as at Banbury, for example--went about breaking at\r\nnight into the churches confided to their care, and smashing the statues\r\nof the saints and defacing the glorious monuments of the past.\r\n\r\nAfter considering all these humours and graces of the most recent French\r\nRepublic, as set forth by the senatorial mayor of Amiens, for the\r\nedification of Picardy and France, it was interesting to walk with Mr.\r\nRuskin from the Place de Périgord up the 'Street of the Three Pebbles,'\r\npast the theatre and the Palais de Justice, to the south transept of\r\nthat glorious cathedral which has not as yet been taken down by night,\r\nunder the senatorial mayor or his friends the ministers, M. Spuller and\r\nM. Yves Guyot. Why should this 'Parthenon of Gothic architecture,' as M.\r\nViollet-le-Duc calls it, be left standing when the Calvary of the poor\r\nat Amiens is cast down and sawn in pieces?\r\n\r\nFor surely Mr. Ruskin, who has written many true and eloquent things,\r\nhas written nothing truer than these words with which he brings to a\r\nclose his remarkable paper called the 'Bible of Amiens':--\r\n\r\n     'The life and gospel and power of Christianity are all written in\r\n     the mighty works of its true believers, in Normandy and Sicily, on\r\n     river-islets of France and in the river glens of England, on the\r\n     rocks of Orvieto and by the sands of Arno. But of all, the\r\n     simplest, completest, and most authoritative in its lessons to the\r\n     active mind of Northern Europe, is this on the foundation-stones of\r\n     Amiens. Believe it or not as you will--only understand how\r\n     thoroughly it was once believed--and that all beautiful things were\r\n     made and all brave deeds done in the strength of it--until what we\r\n     may call \"this present time,\" in which it is gravely asked whether\r\n     religion has any effect on morals, by persons (senatorial and\r\n     other) who have essentially no idea whatever of the meaning of\r\n     either religion or morality.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nIN THE SOMME--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n  AMIENS\r\n\r\nWhere party names are taken from persons, there we may be sure that the\r\npeople are either losing, or have never had, the political instincts\r\nwhich alone can make popular government a government of law and order.\r\nThe Englishmen who are readiest to proclaim themselves 'Gladstonians,'\r\nwhatever may be their other merits, are hardly perhaps the most devoted\r\nchampions either of the British constitution as it is, or of strictly\r\nconstitutional reform. In France to-day, the Republican party is made up\r\nof clans, each taking the name of its chief. There are Ferryists and\r\nClementists, as there were Gambettists; and the Government of the day is\r\nputting forth all its strength to check the drift over of what I suppose\r\nI may without impropriety call the Republican residuum into Boulangism.\r\nHere in Amiens the tide seems to be too strong for the authorities at\r\nParis, and for that matter throughout the department of the Somme. At\r\nthe election nearly a year ago, on August 19, 1888, of a deputy to fill\r\nthe vacancy caused by the death of a Royalist member, M. de Berly,\r\nGeneral Boulanger came forward as a candidate and was elected by an\r\noverwhelming majority. There are 160,400 electors in the department. Of\r\nthese, 121,955 voted. General Boulanger received 76,094 votes, and his\r\nRepublican competitor, M. Barnot, only 41,371, General Boulanger having\r\nbeen elected at the same time for the Nord and the Charente-Inférieure.\r\nGeneral Boulanger resigned his seat and his Republican followers cast\r\ntheir votes for a Royalist, General de Montauban, who was elected. In\r\nthe arrondissement of Amiens, with 57,527 registered voters, General\r\nBoulanger had a majority, in 1888, of 15,274 voters, the whole vote\r\nthrown there being 42,609. Yet, in 1881, on a total registration of\r\n47,923 voters, the Republican candidates for Amiens, M. Goblet and M.\r\nDieu, were elected by a combined majority of 7,094 votes. If the\r\nBoulangists carry Amiens, therefore, at the legislative election this\r\nyear, it may be taken for granted, I think, that M. Goblet and his\r\nfriend the senatorial mayor have not educated their fellow-citizens into\r\nvery staunch and trustworthy supporters of the Republic.\r\n\r\nM. Fleury, the editor-in-chief of the Conservative _Echo de la Somme_,\r\nwho made a pretty thorough canvass of the department before the election\r\nof August 19, 1888, gives me some curious details as to that election.\r\n\r\nThe monarchists, both royalists and imperialists, gave a general and\r\ntacit, and in many cases an overt and active, support to General\r\nBoulanger, their object being the same as his--to bring about a repeal\r\nof the existing law of 1884, which was passed to prevent any real\r\nrevision of the constitution in a sense hostile to the existing\r\nrepublican form of government. Of course if the people of the Somme had\r\nreally cared anything about the Republic as a form of government, they\r\nought to have defeated General Boulanger. It is the opinion of M. Fleury\r\nthat the people of the Somme, and indeed of Picardy, not only care\r\nlittle or nothing about the Republic as a form of government, but\r\nactually and by a considerable majority prefer some monarchical\r\nform--probably, on the whole, the Empire.\r\n\r\nThey are not in the least likely to express this preference at the\r\npolls, because, in common with the vast majority of the electors\r\nthroughout France, they have been born and brought up to take their form\r\nof government from Paris. So long as the government at Paris--be it\r\nroyal, imperial, or republican--controls the executive, the people of\r\nthe provinces are extremely unlikely to make an emphatic effort of their\r\nown to be rid of that government. If Louis Philippe, in 1848, would have\r\nallowed Marshal Bugeaud to use the force at his command in Paris, the\r\nRepublic improvised in February of that year would have been strangled\r\nbefore birth, to the extreme satisfaction of an enormous majority of the\r\nFrench people. This was afterwards overwhelmingly shown by the election\r\nof Louis Napoleon, when General Cavaignac, with all the advantage of the\r\ncontrol of the machinery of government at Paris, could secure only a\r\nrelatively insignificant popular vote at the polls against the\r\nrepresentative of the imperial monarchy. I spent the winter in Paris two\r\nyears afterwards as a youth, during my first tour in Europe, and I there\r\nheard an American resident of Paris, well known at that time in the\r\nworld of French politics, Mr. George Sumner, a brother of the senator\r\nfrom Massachusetts, relate in the _salon_ of M. de Tocqueville a curious\r\nstory of the days of February, which strikingly illustrates the\r\ndisposition of the French provinces at that time to take whatever Paris\r\nmight send them in the way either of administration or of revolution.\r\n\r\nThe king refused to let the Maréchal Duc d'Isly restore order (as there\r\nis no doubt he could easily and quickly have done), on the ground that\r\nhe had received the Crown from the National Guard in Paris, and that he\r\nwould not allow it to be defended by the line against them. The recently\r\npublished letters of his very popular son, the Duc d'Orléans, prove\r\nthat, had that prince been then living, he probably would never have\r\nallowed this scruple to stand in the way of averting a social and\r\npolitical catastrophe. But the duc was in his untimely grave, and the\r\ncontrol of events fell most unexpectedly into the hands of a few men who\r\nhad no concerted plan of action, and, indeed, hardly knew whether they\r\nwere awake or dreaming. 'They proclaimed a republic,' said Mr. Sumner,\r\n'because they did not know what else to do;' but they were in a state of\r\nutter bewilderment at first, as to how they should get the republic\r\naccepted by the provinces. A happy thought struck M. Armand Marrast. In\r\nthose days the French railway system was little developed. Most of the\r\nmails from Paris were carried through the country by malles-postes and\r\ndiligences, and every evening an immense number of these coaches left\r\nthe central bureau for all parts of France. M. Marrast sent into all the\r\nquarters of Paris and impounded, in one way or another, the services and\r\nthe paintpots of every house and furniture painter upon whom his people\r\ncould lay hands. These were all set to work upon the mail coaches. The\r\nroyal arms, with the Charter and the Crown, were painted over, and the\r\nvehicles which, from Paris, carried to all parts of France the news of\r\nthe proclamation of the Republic carried everywhere also an outward and\r\nvisible sign of the establishment of the new government in the words\r\n'République Française' brightly blazoned upon their panels.\r\n\r\nI recalled this story to Mr. Sumner years afterwards in New York, and he\r\nassured me not only that it was literally correct, but that he had been\r\nconsulted himself about it by M. Marrast at the time. This particular\r\ndevice could not now be used as effectively. But, with the telegraph\r\nwires and the telephones in its control, any government which may get\r\nitself installed to-morrow in Paris would certainly have tremendous odds\r\nin its favour, from one end of France to the other. The immense increase\r\nof the French public debt under the republican administration since 1877\r\nhas correspondingly increased, all over France, the number of people\r\nknown as _petits rentiers_, who, having invested their savings, in part\r\nor wholly, in the public securities, will be as quick to acquiesce in\r\nany revolution which they believe to have been successful at Paris, as\r\nthey are slow to promote any revolution, no matter how desirable\r\notherwise a change in the government may seem to them to be. So long as\r\nit is not shaken out of the public offices at Paris, the government of\r\nthe Republic may probably count upon this vast body of quiet people, as\r\nconfidently as the Empire counted upon it twenty years ago, or as the\r\nmonarchy or the dictatorship might count upon it to-morrow, were the\r\nking or the dictator acclaimed in the capital.\r\n\r\nM. Fleury cites one of General Boulanger's most active supporters, M.\r\nMermieix, as saying to him during the election in 1888, 'with a few\r\nmillions of francs, the liberty of the press and of public billsticking,\r\nand three thousand rowdies, I can change the government of this country\r\nin less than a year.'\r\n\r\nThe remark is slightly cynical. But the extreme anxiety of the\r\ngovernment of the Republic to get General Boulanger either into a prison\r\nor out of Paris certainly goes far to justify the boast of M. Mermeix.\r\n\r\n'I told General Boulanger at Doullens,' said M. Fleury, after going\r\nthither in company with him from Amiens, 'that he was sure of his\r\nelection. My reason was that while I saw little real enthusiasm for him\r\nat Amiens, none at all indeed among the middle classes, and no open\r\ndisplay of any on the part of the workmen, I found the peasants for him\r\nalmost to a man. They crowded about his railway carriage. They insisted\r\non shaking hands with him, many of them kissed his hand (that ancient\r\nform of homage lingering still in their traditions), they fired off\r\nguns, and, above all, the women held up their children to be kissed by\r\nhim. This settled the question for me. When I saw him kissing the little\r\ngirls, I knew that he had captured the mammas, and the mammas govern the\r\nrural regions of Picardy.\r\n\r\n'At Doullens I said to him, \"You may be sure of your results now. You\r\nwill win by twenty-five thousand majority.\" He was very modest about it;\r\nbut, though he certainly is not a great politician, he seemed to\r\nunderstand the meaning of this unquestionable popular interest in him\r\nand his progress. I could not help, however, calling his attention to\r\nthe evidence it gave of what I believe to be the profoundly monarchical\r\ninstincts of the peasantry in this part of France.'\r\n\r\n'How did he take it?\r\n\r\n'Oh! he said nothing, but smiled in a way which might mean anything. Of\r\ncourse his idea of a republic of honest men means, and can mean, nothing\r\nbut a republic with a chief who is beyond the reach of deputies and\r\ncontractors.'\r\n\r\n'That,' I said, 'seems to have been simply Lafayette's idea, in 1792, of\r\nan American republic for France, with a hereditary executive; or, in\r\nother words, a French edition of the English \"republic with a crown.\"'\r\n\r\nM. Fleury replied, that this is rather the aim of the monarchists than\r\nof the Boulangists. One of General Boulanger's lieutenants, M. Mermeix,\r\nalready cited, told him frankly that the Boulangists want a sort of\r\nconsulate stopping short of the Empire--a strong republic with a\r\nnationally nominated chief, freedom of conscience, freedom of education,\r\nno more parliaments, a simpler public administration, and the cutting\r\nout of the financial cancer which is destroying the resources of France.\r\nThe coalition now existing between the royalists, the imperialists, and\r\nthe Boulangists, in view of the elections of 1889, obviously rests upon\r\nthe conviction, common to all these parties, that the Republic, as at\r\npresent constituted, is so far committed to a policy of reckless public\r\nexpenditure and of deliberately irreligious propagandism that its\r\nleaders cannot, if they would, either readjust the national finances or\r\nlet the religious question alone.\r\n\r\nA man of much ability and of very high character, who has filled\r\nimportant financial posts under the Empire in this part of France, tells\r\nme that there has been no real balancing, now, of the public books for\r\nseveral years, because the members of the Cour des Comptes whose duty it\r\nis to get this done have found it impossible (and so reported) to get\r\nall the necessary accounts from the Ministry of Finance. As no\r\nConservative members are permitted to sit on the Committee of the\r\nBudget, even such a monstrous thing as this passes unchecked by the\r\nChamber. No wonder that he should tell me, M. Bethmont, one of the\r\nmembers of the Cour des Comptes and a Republican, is of the opinion that\r\nnothing can make matters straight again in France but an Emperor with a\r\nLiberal constitution, or, in other words, a revival of the Ollivier\r\nexperiment of 1870.\r\n\r\nI tried in vain to get from M. Fleury some definite notion of the\r\npolitical programme of General Boulanger. As I have been constantly\r\nassured that the General formed his programme from his observation of\r\nthe institutions of my own country during the short time which he spent\r\nin America, as one of the chosen representatives of France during the\r\ncentennial celebration of the crowning victory of Yorktown, in 1881, I\r\nhave long been not unnaturally curious to ascertain precisely how he\r\nproposes to 'Americanise' the actual government of France. But on this\r\npoint I can get no more light from M. Fleury in Picardy--though M.\r\nFleury spent some time with the General as a not unsympathetic\r\nally--than I have been able to get from any of the General's most\r\ndevoted partisans in Paris. In Picardy as in Paris, Boulangism seems to\r\nrepresent a destructive--or, if the phrase be more polite, a\r\ndetergent--rather than a constructive force. It is not the less worthy\r\nof consideration, perhaps, on this account. But on this account it\r\nappears to me more likely to play a subordinate than a leading part in\r\nthe political movement of these times. It is rather a broom, if I may so\r\nspeak, than a sceptre which the 'brav' général' is expected to wield. In\r\nconversation with M. Fleury, another of General Boulanger's intimate and\r\nconfidential lieutenants, M. Turquet, formerly an Under-Secretary of\r\nState in the Ministry of Fine Arts, who ran for a seat as deputy in the\r\nAisne in 1885, summed up the programme of Boulangism as 'a programme of\r\nliberty.' 'I mean,' he said, 'real liberty, such as exists in America,\r\nnot our Liberalism, which is spurious and archaic. Our actual\r\nrepublicans of to-day are Jacobins, sectarians. Their only notion is to\r\npersecute and proscribe, and they are infinitely further from liberty\r\nthan you royalists are, for you have at your head a prince who has a\r\nthoroughly open mind. The form of government, after all, signifies\r\nlittle. The real question is not whether we shall have a monarchy or an\r\nempire, an autocracy or a democracy. It is whether we shall have\r\nliberty.'[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] M. Turquet ran in September in the first arrondissement of the\r\n    Seine against M. Yves Guyot, and there was no election. At the\r\n    election in October the Government proclaimed M. Yves Guyot elected\r\n    by a small majority.\r\n\r\n'I answered him,' said M. Fleury, 'that what he said was very fine, and\r\nthat the friend of Fourier, Victor Considérant, had said it before him.\r\nWhat I wanted to know, however, was, what the Boulangists proposed to do\r\nwith the Catholics, the believers, in France should the General get into\r\npower.'\r\n\r\n'We shall begin,' said M. Turquet, 'by suppressing the budget of\r\nworship. We shall do this to satisfy the blockheads who are a noun of\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n'But we shall restore, in another shape, to the clergy the indemnity\r\nwhich is certainly due to them. We shall give the bishoprics either a\r\nfixed sum, or a revenue proportional to the population of each\r\nbishopric, so that the people may receive gratuitously the offices of\r\nreligion. This is a public service, and it shall be remunerated as it\r\nought to be. As to the Religious Orders, they shall have full liberty to\r\nconstitute themselves, to educate children, to care for the sick and\r\ninfirm, so long as they keep within the limits of the common law. All\r\nproperty in mortmain shall be suppressed. A community of teachers, for\r\ninstance, may own the college necessary for the students, but not a\r\nforest adjoining that college.'\r\n\r\nTo M. Fleury's natural question how the college should be maintained, M.\r\nTurquet replied, 'You know as well as I do, that wealth no longer\r\nconsists in real estate alone. You can now carry in your pocket a\r\nfortune in bonds payable to the bearer. The Religious Orders may own\r\nthese, like other people. A dozen of us in the Chamber hold these views.\r\nYou seem to think us Utopianists. But General Boulanger will make it\r\npossible for us to apply these ideas!'\r\n\r\nIf General Boulanger and M. Turquet really imagine these views to be\r\n'American,' it would be instructive for them to look into the masterly\r\nprotests of the Catholic Archbishop of New York, against the doctrines\r\nof Mr. Henry George as adopted and expounded by Father McGlynn. The\r\nCatholic Church in the United States holds its own property, real and\r\npersonal, and manages it to suit itself. It would be interesting to see\r\nan attempt made in the legislature of an American State, to carry\r\nthrough a law like the decrees issued in France in 1881, forbidding\r\ncurates and vicars to receive legacies left to them for the benefit of\r\nthe poor in their parishes, or to distribute to the poor sums left to\r\nthe Bureau of Public Charity, with an express proviso that they should\r\nbe distributed by the clergy of the place.\r\n\r\nOn one very important question of French politics, M. Fleury, as a\r\npractical politician in this great and active department, gives me a\r\ngood deal of useful light. This is the question of the expenses of the\r\nelectoral machine. In France, as in America, no limit is set by the law\r\nto the possible expenditure of a political candidate. I have already\r\ngiven the estimate made for me in Artois of the general cost of the\r\nlegislative elections, and I have been told by more than one\r\nwell-informed French politician in other parts of France, that the\r\naverage cost of a candidacy for a seat in the Chamber may be roughly\r\nestimated at twenty-five thousand francs, or a thousand pounds sterling.\r\nThis would show, allowing two candidates only for each seat, an\r\nexpenditure of thirty millions of francs, or twelve hundred thousand\r\npounds, at each French parliamentary election, being very nearly the\r\nfigure given me in Artois. We send only 330 members to Washington, but\r\nwe elect a new House every two years. The British House of Commons,\r\nthough more numerous even than the French Chamber, probably spends a\r\ngood deal less upon getting itself elected than either the French or the\r\nAmerican House.[4]\r\n\r\n    [4] At this time (October, 1889) there is a difficulty in New York\r\n    about a good candidate for the seat vacated by the death of the late\r\n    Mr. S. S. Cox, being a prominent democratic member of Congress,\r\n    because the candidate must consent to an annual 'assessment' on his\r\n    salary for political purposes. The French Government, I am told,\r\n    collects these 'contributions' easily, the deputies 'recouping'\r\n    themselves by patronage.\r\n\r\nOne of the 'working sub-prefects' of the Boulangist party in Picardy\r\ngave M. Fleury a very frank estimate of the expense of electing the\r\nGeneral in 1888, in the Somme. He put it, in round numbers, at nearly or\r\nquite one hundred and twenty-five thousand francs, or five thousand\r\npounds. This unusual outlay was made necessary by the great efforts of\r\nthe Government to defeat the General. Furthermore, it was swollen by the\r\ndisinterested devotion of many of the General's friends. Some of these\r\nauxiliaries spent days at the best hotels in Picardy labouring for the\r\ncause, with the result of a special hotel account, amounting to several\r\nthousand francs. Nothing makes men so thirsty as political emotion.\r\nAnother partisan, at the head of a journal, sent in a bill for\r\nforty-five thousand francs expended by him upon printing and stationery,\r\nno charge being made for his personal services! The chief agents\r\nreceived about two thousand francs apiece. One of them must have worked\r\nvery hard, for he earned no less than fifteen thousand francs. While all\r\nthis expense was incurring in Picardy, furthermore, two other elections\r\nwere pending, in each of which the General was a candidate, one in the\r\nCharente and one in the Nord. It would seem to be probable enough,\r\ntherefore, that on these three elections In 1888 General Boulanger, or\r\nthe Boulangists, must have spent at least two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nfrancs, or ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n'Where did all this money come from?' is a not unnatural question. For\r\nM. Fleury tells me the General's bills were paid much more promptly than\r\nthe bills of the Government candidates. It is an open secret apparently\r\nthat the Government candidates are very bad paymasters when they are\r\nbeaten. Some of the bills incurred by them in 1885, when the\r\nConservatives swept so large a part of Northern France, were still due,\r\nit appears, in 1888. But the bills of General Boulanger were settled\r\nvery soon after the close of the campaign.\r\n\r\nM. Mermeix insisted to M. Fleury that the General's war-chest was\r\nsupplied by voluntary subscriptions. 'Every day,' he said, the General\r\nfinds some ten thousand francs in his mails, and his followers 'are all\r\neither beggars or millionaires.'\r\n\r\nAnother of the General's managers gave M. Fleury the names of two very\r\nrich persons, one of them a cattle merchant at La Villette, who\r\nsubscribed between them a hundred and forty thousand francs to carry on\r\nthe campaign in Picardy. The enormous importance given to General\r\nBoulanger by his terrified former associates in the Government seems to\r\nme to be a very striking proof of the little confidence they really have\r\nin their own hold upon the country, or in the permanency of 'republican\r\ninstitutions' as they now exist in France, and this adequately explains\r\nthe readiness of speculators to 'invest' in what may be called the\r\n'Boulangist bonds.' Such a report as that presented not very long ago to\r\nthe Chamber by M. Gerville-Réache on the state of the navy in France\r\nsuffices to show that the speculative maladministration of the French\r\nfinances has been so great as to make it quite certain that any 'honest\r\ngovernment' coming into power must reconstruct the system of the public\r\nindebtedness. That is an operation which can hardly be carried out by\r\nthe most scrupulously honest government without very great profits to\r\nthe financiers concerned in it, and I only set down what is said to me\r\nby respectable Frenchmen when I say that the Boulanger campaign funds\r\nare openly described, by persons not at all hostile to 'Boulangism,' as\r\n'bets on the General.' 'The difference between the managers of the\r\nBoulangist campaign and the managers of the Government campaign,' said a\r\ngentleman to me in Amiens, 'is simply this--that the Boulangist managers\r\nare playing the game with private funds, and the others with public\r\nfunds. So the latter, I think, will win, for they have the longest purse\r\nto draw on.' This gentleman is of the opinion, however, that but for\r\nGeneral Saussier, in command of the garrison of Paris, General\r\nBoulanger, after the election of January 27, 1889, in which he took the\r\ncapital by storm, might have turned the Government neck and heels out of\r\ndoors. The weak point of Boulangism,' he said, 'is Boulanger.' 'He has\r\nno strength with the officers of the army. They have no confidence\r\neither in his character or in his ability; not that they think his\r\ncharacter bad or deny his ability, but only that they regard him as a\r\nshallow, vacillating, and mediocre person who made himself valuable to\r\nthe Republican politicians by going into alliances with them to which\r\nother officers of strong character and high ability would not stoop. As\r\nfor the quarrel between Boulanger and these politicians, it is a\r\nbeggars' quarrel, to be made up over the pot of broth. But it won't be\r\nmade up, because they can't agree as to the distribution of the broth.\r\nMeanwhile all the chickens of France are going into the broth, and the\r\npeasant's pot will see them no more, as in the good old days of Henry\r\nIV.!'\r\n\r\nAs for the absurd story that the Boulangist funds come from America, the\r\nonly foundation I can find for that seems to be the intimacy, which, I\r\nbelieve, is no longer as close as it was, between General Boulanger, M.\r\nde Rochefort, and a French nobleman of an ancient historic family, who\r\nhas married a very wealthy American wife, and who has long been known to\r\nentertain the most extreme, not to say revolutionary, notions in\r\npolitics. The honest Boulangists who really hope to see a good\r\ngovernment established by putting out M. Carnot and putting in General\r\nBoulanger, swell the tide of his supporters, apparently, here as\r\nelsewhere in France, because they blindly hope for everything from him\r\nwhich their experience forbids them to hope for from the men actually in\r\npower. As one of his most cynical supporters long ago said in Paris, he\r\nis 'the grand common sewer of the disgust of France.'\r\n\r\nHis popularity with the common soldiers is another element to be counted\r\nwith in estimating the strength of this military French Mahdi.\r\n\r\nI have struck up a friendship here at Amiens with an excellent woman who\r\npresides over a shop--not one of the _pâtisseries_ so justly celebrated\r\nby Mr. Ruskin--and who is a very good type of the shrewd, sensible\r\nFrench '_petite bourgeoise_,' such a woman as, I dare say, Jacqueline\r\nRobins of St.-Omer was in her own time. She has a son in the army, who\r\nis likely soon to be a corporal. '_Dame_, Monsieur,' she said to me, 'if\r\nM. Boulanger is not the best General in France, why did they make him\r\nMinister of War? You do not know what he did for the soldiers! My son\r\nwhen he gets his stripes is to marry--she is a very nice girl, an only\r\nchild, do you know? and her father, who is very solid, will put her in\r\nher own furniture--and more than that! and they will have their own\r\nestablishment. They could not have that, you know, but for General\r\nBoulanger, who made the new rule about the wives of the sub-officers.\r\nAnd they used to shave the soldiers--imagine it!--just like prisoners,\r\nand such beds as they gave them--it was a horror! Well, all that he\r\nchanged, and he made the soup fit to eat.'\r\n\r\n'The other generals are not very fond of him, you say? _Parbleu!_ that\r\nis likely enough! It is like the _conseillers_ here in the city--one of\r\nthem does well, the others always find something to say behind his back!\r\nAnd that affair on the frontier! You know, Monsieur, he had all the army\r\nin hand--ah, well in hand--a hundred thousand men ready to march; and\r\nthose rascals of Germans they knew it, and they gave up our man. I am\r\nglad we had no war. No! I do not want a war, but, _dame_, one must have\r\nteeth, you know, and be ready to show them!'\r\n\r\n'You want to see your War Minister made president, then?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'President? what does that signify? Chief of the State--Emperor; ah!\r\nthose were the good times here in Amiens, Monsieur, not as it is to-day\r\nwith the eternal debts that M. Dauphin made us a present of. Eh! an old\r\nhypocrite that man is! and with these _centimes additionnels_ that never\r\nend! And then these water-mètres! Eh! that is a pretty invention to make\r\nwater as dear as wine at Amiens, and yet, God knows, wine is not too\r\ncheap, with the octroi of Amiens! It is worse than at Paris! Call him\r\nwhat you like, Monsieur, _c'est Boulanger qu'il nous faut_--that is to\r\nsay, we must have a man at Paris. And you will see he is the man; all\r\nthe mothers of soldiers will tell you that!'\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the municipal finances, the 'good old times'\r\nof the Empire may well have a charm for the taxpayers of Amiens.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Amiens, with 61,063 inhabitants, raised and spent a municipal\r\nrevenue of rather more than a million and a half of francs, or, in round\r\nnumbers, about 25 francs, or 20 shillings, _per capita_ of the\r\npopulation. A public loan, made in 1854, had been almost wholly paid\r\noff, and the city treasury still held 600,000 francs of a loan of\r\n1,600,000 francs made in 1862 for certain public improvements. The\r\nmunicipal government cost 372,000 francs, and 180,000 francs were spent\r\non the public schools. Of the municipal income, 987,802 francs were\r\nderived from four forms of direct taxation, and 770,000 francs from the\r\n_octroi_. This gave an average of a little less than 13 francs _per\r\ncapita_ as the burden of the _octroi_ upon the population.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the population had increased to 74,000. The direct taxes brought\r\nin 1,184,724 francs, and the _octroi_, 1,498,459, making the average\r\nburden of the _octroi per capita_ 20 fr. 20 c., or an increase of about\r\n50 per cent. in the pressure of that form of tax upon the population, as\r\ncompared with 1870. As the _octroi_ is imposed upon food and beverages\r\nof all kinds--fuel, forage, and building materials--this tax is regarded\r\nin France as a measure for estimating the general well-being of the\r\ninhabitants. Thus measured, there would seem to be a falling off in the\r\ngeneral well-being of the people of Amiens since 1883. For, while the\r\npressure _per capita_ of the octroi is much greater than it was in 1870,\r\nthe actual receipts from the _octroi_ were less with a population of\r\n74,000 in 1886, than they were in 1883. In 1883 the _octroi_ yielded\r\n1,533,140 francs. In 1886 it yielded only 1,498,459 francs. The falling\r\noff was in the receipts from beverages, from provisions, from forage,\r\nand from building materials. The tariff of the _octroi_ meanwhile has\r\nremained substantially without change from 1873 to the present time. It\r\nis an expensive tax to collect, the costs of collection in 1886\r\namounting to 11.85 per cent. of the receipts.\r\n\r\nAdding together now the receipts from the direct taxes and the _octroi_\r\nof Amiens in 1886, we have a sum of 2,683,183 francs, or in round\r\nnumbers about 1,100,000 francs more than in 1870. But while, as I have\r\nstated, in 1870 the receipts equalled and balanced the expenses of the\r\nmunicipal government, this is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 Amiens, with an income of 2,683,183 francs, spent 4,162,294\r\nfrancs, giving an average municipal outlay of 56 fr. 10 c. _per capita_\r\nand an excess of expenditure over revenue of no less than 1,479,111\r\nfrancs, or very nearly the total income and outlay of the city under the\r\nEmpire. No wonder that the public debt of the department of the Somme,\r\nof which Amiens is the capital, seems in 1886 to have amounted to\r\n18,303,496 francs! What inequalities of pressure upon the people of the\r\ndepartment this involves may be estimated from the fact that, while\r\nthere are in the Somme 836 communes, only 404, or less than half of\r\nthese communes, are authorised to raise money by loans, and one-eighth\r\nof them to raise money by _octrois_. Yet we are constantly told that all\r\ninequalities and privileges were abolished throughout France by a stroke\r\nof the pen in the _annus mirabilis_ 1789![5] The taxation in 20 communes\r\nis estimated at 15 centimes, or less; in 87, at from 15 to 30; in 268,\r\nat from 31 to 50; in 428, at from 51 to 100; and in 33, at 100 centimes\r\nand upwards. These are the communal taxes. To these must be added 51\r\ncentimes for the departmental taxes, ordinary and extraordinary; 2\r\ncentimes for the land-tax; 19 centimes for the personal tax and taxes\r\non personal property; 18.8 centimes for the doors and windows tax; and\r\n39.6 centimes for licences. For Amiens these fractions taken together\r\nmount up to 119-4/10 centimes.\r\n\r\n    [5] 'Privileges' were, in fact, abolished only by Napoleon in 1804.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to weary myself or my readers with figures. But these\r\nfigures tell the story of the difference between the government of\r\nFrance under the much reviled Empire and under the present government,\r\nwhich is represented to us as the natural and admirable 'evolution' of\r\nrepublican institutions in this country. In 1870, as I have stated, the\r\nreceipts and expenditure of the city of Amiens balanced one another. The\r\ncity paid its way, and lived up to, not beyond, its means.\r\n\r\nWith the war came upon it, of course, heavy and unexpected burdens:\r\nGerman local exactions, its share of the general German ransom of\r\nFrance, local war expenses, and its share of the general war\r\nexpenditure. For three years the citizens left their affairs, thus\r\ndisturbed and encumbered, to be managed by a municipal council trained\r\nin the methodical habits of the imperial administration, with the result\r\nthat in 1874 the expenses of Amiens amounted to 2,479,802 francs, and\r\nits revenues to 2,016,130 francs, leaving thus a deficit of 463,672\r\nfrancs, substantially accounted for by the necessary payments on a loan\r\nof 5,000,000 francs negotiated in Brussels by M. Dauphin at the very\r\nhigh rate of 7-1/2 per cent. The affairs of Amiens were arranged three\r\nyears afterwards by a municipal Commission, which turned them over, in\r\n1878, to the 'Republicans of Gambetta,' with a budget involving an\r\nexpenditure of 2,686,660 francs, against a revenue from taxation of\r\n2,249,245 fr. 52 c., showing a reduced deficit of no more than 437,405\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nBy 1880 the expenditure had risen to 3,156,616 francs, while the revenue\r\nstood at 2,531,762, showing a deficit of 624,854 francs, being an\r\nincrease of nearly fifty per cent, in two years! From that time the gulf\r\nhas gone on widening between the receipts and the expenditure of the\r\nancient capital of Picardy, until the figures laid before me, as taken\r\nfrom the official reports, show during the seven years 1880-86, a total\r\nof 18,530,477.01 francs of receipts against a total of 24,551,977 francs\r\nof expenditure, leaving a deficit for these seven years of 5,021,500\r\nfrancs, or more than the amount of the Dauphin loan incurred by Amiens\r\nas a consequence of the German occupation, and of the exactions of Count\r\nLehndorff!\r\n\r\nWhat has been done during the past three years can only as yet be\r\nconjectured. The accounts are made up at the mayoralty office, and\r\nthence sent to the préfecture, and they do not get within range of the\r\ntaxpayer for at least a twelvemonth afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut M. Fleury assures me that between the years 1884 and 1888 the city\r\nexpended in buildings, chiefly 'scholastic palaces' erected as batteries\r\nof aggressive atheism from which to beat down the temples of religion,\r\nno less than 1,700,000 francs; so that the total of deficit of the\r\nbudget of Amiens, from 1880 to the present time, in all probability\r\nexceeds six millions of francs.\r\n\r\nIf we assume the local finances of the rest of France to have been\r\nhandled during the last decade on the same lines, there is nothing\r\nextravagant in the estimate made by a friend of mine, who formerly held\r\na very high post in the Treasury, and who puts the accumulation of local\r\ndeficits and the local indebtedness in France, independently of the\r\nnational deficits and the national loans, since 1880, at two milliards\r\nof francs, or eighty millions of pounds sterling. For, although\r\nAmiens is an important city, it represents only about one\r\nfour-hundred-and-fiftieth part of the population of France.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Amiens in June M. Goblet came there and made a rather\r\nremarkable speech. It was in the main aimed at a society called the\r\n'Association of the Conservative Young Men of Amiens,' all of whom, I am\r\ntold, except the president, are young working men--mechanics, clerks, or\r\nthe sons of clerks, mechanics, and working men--in short, a kind of\r\nFrench 'Tory democracy.' They are not Boulangists at all, but outspoken\r\nroyalists. They support Boulanger simply and avowedly in order to get at\r\na revision of the Constitution and make an end of the Republic. 'This\r\nassociation,' said M. Goblet, 'is making a tremendous stir. I admit its\r\nright to do this. It holds meetings and conferences; it listens to\r\nspeeches in the city and the suburbs; it attacks both democracy and the\r\nRepublic in no measured terms; it does not hesitate to denounce its\r\nenemies personally and by name, and neglects no means of acting on\r\npublic opinion. These conservative young men speak and act\r\nenergetically. They believe in the re-establishment of the monarchy;\r\nthey desire it; they preach a reaction against all that we have done for\r\ntwenty years past!'\r\n\r\nThere could hardly be a more signal proof given of the reality and\r\nvitality of the anti-Republican movement in this part of France than\r\nthese words of a Republican leader who began his political career, as I\r\nhave shown, twenty years ago in a hopeless minority of Republicans under\r\nthe Empire, who has since worked his way up the municipal ladder at\r\nAmiens and up the legislative ladder in Paris; and who, after reaching\r\nthe top of the tree, now finds himself in imminent peril of slipping\r\ndown again to the point from which he started. The force of the\r\ntestimony is certainly not weakened by the fact that at the legislative\r\nelections in September, M. Goblet, standing as a candidate for the\r\nChamber, was completely beaten.\r\n\r\nI have shown what a large part the _octroi_ plays in the revenue of a\r\ncity like Amiens. Nothing resembling it, I believe, exists in England\r\nsince the abolition, two or three years ago, of the coal dues in London;\r\nand, though I suppose it would be within the power of any American State\r\nto establish a tax of this sort within its own boundaries, it would be\r\npractically impossible to enforce it without coming into collision with\r\nthe commercial rights of other States under the Federal Constitution. I\r\nonce had to pay the _octroi_ tax on two brace of Maryland canvas-back\r\nducks, which I was taking over from London to a Christmas dinner in\r\nParis. But Maryland would not submit to an _octroi_ upon her birds\r\nentering New York.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the _octroi_ at this time in the financial system of\r\nFrance is one of the most conclusive and most amusing proofs of the\r\nessentially superficial and ephemeral character of the alleged 'Great\r\nRevolution' of 1789. The _octroi_ was a revival in mediæval France of\r\nthe Roman _portorium_ which survives in the Italian offices of the\r\n_dazio consume_ and in the _garitas_ of Spain and Spanish America. It\r\nwas originally imposed as a local tax by a city, under the sanction of a\r\nroyal charter. To get such a charter from a sovereign strong enough to\r\nenforce respect for it was essential to the citizens who bound\r\nthemselves to one another to maintain their local independence against\r\nthe barons in their neighbourhood; and when such a charter was granted\r\nby a sovereign it was said to be _octroyée_ by him. The tax therefore is\r\nrooted in a privilege. Amiens obtained the right to impose it in the\r\nfourteenth century. Of course the 'Great Revolution of 1789' swept this\r\nright away, one of the most obvious 'rights of man' being to pluck an\r\napple in an orchard, take it into a town in his pocket, and eat it\r\nthere. But equally, of course, the Republic in the year VII. on the 29th\r\nVendémiaire re-established it; and in the next year, VIII., provided\r\nthat the privilege should be exercised as under the sanction of the\r\nNational Government, the National Government reserving the right to\r\nrevise the tariffs fixed by the municipal councils, and thereby making\r\nthe restored privilege of the _octrois_ another string whereby to fetter\r\nand control the local action of the people on their own affairs. The\r\n_octroi_ of Amiens was re-established on the 3rd of Brumaire next\r\nfollowing. Under the Empire, the Restoration, and the Monarchy of July,\r\nthe Council of State granted the _octrois_. Under the Republic of 1848\r\nthis power naturally went to the National Assembly as a means of\r\nlegislative pressure and corruption. The Second Empire restored it to\r\nthe Council of State; and it has now, naturally, gone back to the\r\nChambers. Neither the people of the cities nor the rural populations\r\nlike the _octroi_, but, in the immortal words of the late Mr. Tweed of\r\nNew York, 'What can they do about it?' It is a ready-money tax, from\r\nwhich the taxpayer receives no visible equivalent, as he does when he\r\npays a penny for a postage stamp. When he has paid it, he is simply\r\nallowed to take his own property where he wishes to take it, and do with\r\nit what he wishes to do. It is quite likely that this _octroi_ may have\r\nsomething to do with the disinclination of the common people in France\r\nto part with small change as readily as do the Americans, and even the\r\nEnglish. They must always have 'money in the pocket' if they want to\r\nbring a sausage and a bottle of beer through a 'barrier,' whereas an\r\nAmerican is never called upon to pay cash down to his Government except\r\nat a custom-house when he returns to his country from a foreign trip,\r\nor in exchange for a licence or a document of some sort which represents\r\nvalue received in one or another form.\r\n\r\nThe time wasted over this tax in a city like Amiens is an extraordinary\r\nburden on the patience of the people, trained as the French people are\r\nto submit to a torment of eternal red tape, a week of which would drive\r\nan American or English town into open revolt. At Amiens, for example,\r\nthere is a central bureau of the _octroi_, where the tax is received\r\nfrom the great breweries and warehouses after the amounts have been\r\nfixed by the officers on duty at those establishments. Then there are\r\nten bureaux or 'barriers' at the railway stations, the slaughter-houses,\r\nand the fish-markets; and then again eight secondary bureaux, where the\r\npeople must go and pay amounts of less than one franc. There are, and I\r\nam told have long been, loud complaints as to the inconvenient location\r\nof the bureaux; but nothing comes of these outcries as yet, and I\r\npresume nothing ever will come of them until something like an\r\nindependent local administrative life exists in the provinces of France.\r\n\r\nThe elements of such a life ought surely to be found, if anywhere, in\r\nthis ancient province of Picardy. You cannot traverse it in any\r\ndirection without being struck by the evident prosperity of the people.\r\nArthur Young, a hundred years ago, travelling from Boulogne to Amiens,\r\nfound only 'misery and miserable harvests.' He would find now only\r\ncomfort and excellent crops. Possibly he would think of the country what\r\nhe then thought of the region about Clermont and Liancourt, where, under\r\nthe fostering care of the Duc de la Rochefoucauld, the farmers had\r\ndeveloped a highly-diversified cultivation; 'here a field of wheat;\r\nthere one of luzerne; clover in one direction, vetches in another;\r\nvines, cherry and other fruit trees making up a charming picture, which\r\nmust, however, yield poor results.'\r\n\r\nBut he would be wrong. This diversified culture of modern Picardy has\r\nbeen highly remunerative, and the extensive kitchen-gardening of the\r\nprovince is so still. The 'agricultural crisis' has doubtless hit the\r\nlarge farmers rather hard, but I am told they are standing up well under\r\nit--thanks to their past savings, and to French protection--better,\r\nindeed, than the large farmers in England; while the peasants proper are\r\nactually profiting by it. They not only get as much for their labour as\r\nwhen the large farmers were making money, but they are buying up land at\r\nlower rates. This may very possibly help the Republicans in the coming\r\nelections, for the peasants always give the credit of a state of things\r\nwhich is satisfactory to them to the Government of the day--be that\r\nGovernment what it may--so that while the larger farmers tend to\r\nConservatism, the peasants will probably lean the other way. It is next\r\nto impossible to get a political opinion out of a Picard peasant, but I\r\nhave more than once heard a peasant speak of the farmers in his\r\nneighbourhood as 'aristocrats,' which I took to be as precise a formula\r\nof political opinion as one was likely to get from him. It seemed to me\r\nto represent, among the peasants of to-day, the enlightened 'principles\r\nof 1889,' very much as the same formula, applied to the _noblesse_ of a\r\ncentury ago, represented, among the large farmers of that day, the\r\n'principles of 1789.'\r\n\r\nBoth then and now the formula simply means 'the man who has what I want\r\nto have is an aristocrat.' I think I have observed something like this\r\nin other countries--as, for example, in Ireland--where the guilty\r\npossessor of acres, however, is not only an 'aristocrat' but an 'alien,'\r\nas appears from a song popular in Kerry:--\r\n\r\n  The alien landlords have no right\r\n    To the land God made for you;\r\n  So we'll blow them up with dynamite,\r\n    The thieving, hellish crew!\r\n\r\nDynamite was unknown in Picardy a century and a half ago. And the Picard\r\nhas very little, except his religion, in common with the Irish Celt. But\r\nthe sentiment of this simple and pleasing little ditty glowed deep in\r\nthe Picard heart long before the Revolution of 1789. The 'earth hunger,'\r\nwhich has given the act of 'land-grabbing' the first place in the\r\ncategory of human crimes, invented, long ago in Picardy, and especially\r\nin that part of Picardy now known as the Department of the Somme, a\r\ncustom called the _coutume de mauvais gré_ or the _droit de marché_.\r\nUnder this custom a tenant-farmer in Picardy considered himself entitled\r\nto sell the right to till his landlord's fields to anybody he liked, to\r\ngive it as a dowry to his daughter, or to leave it to be divided among\r\nhis heirs; and all this without reference to the expiration of his\r\nlease. If the landlord objected and went so far as to lease his land to\r\nanother person, the previous tenant was regarded by his friends and by\r\nother farmers as a _dépointé_, entitled to take summary vengeance upon\r\nthe 'land-grabber.' He might kill off his cattle, burn his crops and his\r\nbuildings, and, if occasion served, shoot or knock him in the head. As\r\nthe whole country was in a conspiracy, either of terror or of sympathy,\r\nto protect the _dépointé_ against the vengeance of the law, this\r\ncheerful 'custom' had a liberalising effect upon the Picard landholders.\r\nRents fell, and if the value of landed property rose the landed\r\nproprietor got no advantage from that. The torch and the musket kept\r\ndown the demand, which was equivalent practically to increasing the\r\nsupply. The results of this 'custom' were such that in 1764, a quarter\r\nof a century before the Revolution of 1789, the king intervened, but in\r\nvain, to put a stop to it. The 'oppressed and downtrodden peasant' of\r\nPicardy under the _ancien régime_ did what he liked with his neighbour's\r\nproperty--that neighbour being a landlord--as cheerily as the manacled\r\nCelt of Mayo or Tipperary in our own times. Two years before the\r\nRevolution, in 1787, the assembly of the Generality of Amiens, by its\r\npresident the Duc d'Hâvré, vainly urged the royal government to take\r\nresolute action in this matter. With the Revolution, of course, things\r\ngrew worse very rapidly. The _dépointés_ became ardent lovers of\r\nliberty, equality, and fraternity; tore up all their leases, sent their\r\nlandlords and the land-grabbers to the guillotine, or into emigration as\r\ntraitors, and made themselves proprietors, in fee simple. There seems to\r\nbe no doubt that the traditions of this _coutume de mauvais gré_ (which\r\nobviously had much more to do with the politics of Picardy a century ago\r\nthan either Voltaire or Rousseau) still survive in the Department of the\r\nSomme, and every now and then break out in agrarian outrages,\r\nrick-burnings, and general incendiarism, whenever leases fall in and\r\nlandlords try to raise their rents on the shallow pretext that land has\r\nrisen in value.\r\n\r\nWhile these traditions show that there was no lack of energy and force\r\namong the 'downtrodden' Picard peasantry before the Revolution of 1789,\r\nthe local history of the province also proves that the liberal ideas\r\nwhich are commonly supposed to have been introduced into France by the\r\nRevolution were at work in Picardy among the _noblesse_ and the clergy\r\nlong before. The _corvée_, for example, of which we hear so much in\r\nmany so-called histories of the French Revolution, was abolished under\r\nLouis XVI. in Picardy, before the States-General of 1789 were convened.\r\n\r\nThat the _corvée_, in itself, cannot have been the absolutely\r\nintolerable thing it is commonly supposed to have been may be inferred,\r\nI think, from the fact that, under the name of _prestation en nature_,\r\nit still exists in many parts of the French Republic. It figures in all\r\nthe schedules of departmental taxation which I have seen down to the\r\nyear 1889; and, for that matter, it existed in New England down to a\r\nvery recent date, if it does not now exist there. It was obviously\r\nliable to abuse, and doubtless was abused, and the Intendant of Picardy,\r\nM. d'Aguay, made a striking speech, on the benefits to be expected from\r\nits abolition, to the Provincial Parliament in 1787. From this speech we\r\nlearn that the money value of the _corvée_ in hand had been computed at\r\n900,000 livres, but that the Intendant working out the details of the\r\nabolition of the system, with the help of a number of the local\r\nlandholders (commonly supposed to have been the tyrants who profited by\r\nthe abuse), had reduced this estimate to 300,000 livres, at which sum\r\nthe tax had been converted into a money payment for the maintenance of\r\nthe roads, the province being thus relieved of two-thirds of the burden\r\nborne by it. It is instructive to learn that attempts to bring about\r\nsimilar results elsewhere in France were resented and resisted, not by\r\nthe great landholders, but by the corvéable peasants themselves! What\r\nthey really wanted, it would seem, was not so much to be relieved of the\r\nobligation of forced labour by a payment of money, as to have their\r\nroads made for them at the expense of the State, under the impression,\r\nineradicable down to our own day, and elsewhere than in France, that\r\nwhat everybody pays nobody pays, an impression which is the trusty\r\nshield and weapon at once of the Socialists and of the Protectionists\r\nall over the world.\r\n\r\nPublic education in Picardy, as well as elsewhere in France, long\r\nantedates the Revolution of 1789. Three centuries ago Olivier de Serre\r\nand Bernard Palissy lamented the foolish disposition of French peasants\r\nin the Limousin and in Picardy to give their elder sons a better\r\neducation than they had themselves received. 'The poor man will spend a\r\ngreat part of what he has earned in the sweat of his brow, to make his\r\nson a gentleman; and at last this same gentleman will be ashamed to be\r\nfound in company with his father, and will be displeased to be called\r\nthe son of a labouring man. And if by chance the good man has other\r\nchildren, this gentleman it will be who will devour the others and have\r\nthe best of everything; he never concerns himself to think how much he\r\ncost at school while his brothers were working at home with their\r\nfather.' This reads like a complaint of the nineteenth century in\r\ndemocratic America, but it is, in fact, a complaint of the sixteenth\r\ncentury in feudal France. It must have been frequent enough in this part\r\nof Picardy, now the Department of the Somme. For from a very early time\r\nthis region has been full of small farmers bent on bettering their own\r\ncondition or that of their sons. In the public library of Abbeville\r\nthere is a land register drawn up in 1312 for the service of the\r\nofficers of King Edward II. of England, who had married Isabel of\r\nFrance, from which it appears that the small tenants in this part of\r\nPicardy were then as numerous as the small proprietors now are. 'One is\r\nled to believe,' says M. Baudrillart, 'that the only difference between\r\nthe condition of the country then and now in this respect is, that the\r\nenfranchised labourer has in many cases simply taken the place of the\r\nfeudal tenant and become proprietor of the soil.' So great has long\r\nbeen the number of small landholders in Picardy that in the province,\r\ntaken generally, a holding of sixty hectares may pass for a large\r\nproperty, one of fifteen for a moderate estate, and one of ten for a\r\nsmall holding. The action of the French code upon this state of things\r\nsince the Revolution and the Empire has, in the opinion of many\r\nintelligent observers, been mischievous. It has made it difficult to\r\ncheck the excessive subdivision of the land into holdings too small to\r\nbe profitably and intelligently cultivated. There is no provision in the\r\nFrench law it seems, as there is in the German law, making it obligatory\r\nupon the heirs of a small landed property so to arrange their respective\r\nshares as not to impede the proper cultivation of the land. The great\r\nprosperity of kitchen-gardening in modern Picardy modifies the evils\r\nflowing from this state of things however, and those who know the\r\ncountry best tell me that, taken as a body, the small landholders of\r\nPicardy, thanks to their thrift in regard both of time and of money, are\r\nsubstantially well off. They don't like the townspeople, for the old\r\ntraditions are not yet forgotten of the time in which Amiens and the\r\nother large towns used to shift the main burden of the expenses of the\r\nprovince upon the shoulders of the peasantry; and if anything like a\r\ngenuine provincial legislature could be established, with a working\r\nsystem of 'Home Rule,' all the elements are here which might be\r\ndeveloped into a healthy political activity. The system of working on\r\nFrance from the centre at Paris to the circumference has certainly been\r\ntried long enough, and thoroughly enough, to show that nothing but evil,\r\nand that continually, can be expected from it.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty years have passed since Heine said: 'When I speak of\r\nFrance I speak of Paris--not of the provinces; just as when I speak of\r\na man, I speak of his head, not of his legs. To talk about the opinion\r\nof the provinces is like talking about the opinion of a man's legs.'\r\n\r\nIn this spirit France is still judged abroad, for in this spirit France\r\nis still governed at home. But if, on some fine morning, the legs should\r\nsuddenly wake up with a very positive opinion of their own, the results\r\nmay be awkward--not only for the government at Paris but for the rest of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nIN THE AISNE\r\n\r\n\r\n  ST.-GOBAIN\r\n\r\nThe short railway journey from Amiens on the Somme to La Fère on the\r\nOise takes you through a country which, on a fine summer's morning,\r\nreminds one of the old Kentuckian description of an agricultural\r\nparadise--'tickle it with a hoe, and it laughs with a harvest.' As, in\r\none direction, Picardy extends into the modern Department of the\r\nPas-de-Calais, so in other directions it includes no inconsiderable part\r\nof the modern Departments of the Oise and of the Aisne. In this way it\r\ntouches the central province of the Ile-de-France, the main body of\r\nwhich is now divided into the three Departments of the Seine, the\r\nSeine-et-Oise, and the Seine-et-Marne. From Amiens to La Fère,\r\ntherefore, the pulse of the French capital may be said to throb visibly\r\nabout you in the rural beauty of a region which owes its value and its\r\nfertility less to the natural qualities of the soil than to the\r\nquickening influences of the great metropolis. For centuries Paris lived\r\nmainly on the Ile-de-France, and the Ile-de-France on Paris. Since the\r\nsteam-engine and the railway have opened, both to the province and to\r\nthe capital, the markets of all France and of all Europe, both the\r\nprovince and the capital are infinitely more prosperous than in the old\r\ndays when the lack of communications and the lawlessness of men made\r\nthem dependent one upon the other. The steppes of Russia and the\r\nprairies of America now compete with the grain-fields of the\r\nIle-de-France; the timber of the Baltic with its timber; and I have no\r\ndoubt that, during his six years in the prison of Ham, Louis Napoleon\r\ndrank there better Chambertin than ever found its way to the table of\r\nthe Grand Monarque at Versailles, after a certain enterprising peasant\r\nwalked all the way from his native province to the capital, beside his\r\noxcart laden with casks, to prove to the king the merits of the true\r\nBurgundian vintage.\r\n\r\nCertainly it would never occur to anybody now in Soissons or Laon to\r\nmake the journey to Paris, as people did a hundred and fifty years ago,\r\nto drink the water of the Seine, as being 'the best in the world, and a\r\nspecific against burning fevers and obstructive ailments.'\r\n\r\nBut the vast commons which lay waste throughout the Ile-de-France a\r\nhundred years ago are now green with crops; meadows have replaced the\r\nmarshes; orchards and gardens on every side show what the Campagna of\r\nRome may become, at no distant day, if Italy can make her peace with the\r\nChurch, and the Italian capital remain, on terms of justice and reason,\r\nthe capital of the Catholic world.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution the Generality of Paris contained 150,000 arpents\r\nof waste commons; the Generality of Soissons 120,000 arpents. In 1778 a\r\nwriter deplores the spectacle, 'within thirteen leagues of the capital,\r\nof vast marshes left to be inundated because they are common lands,\r\nproducing not a single bundle of hay in a year, and affording scanty\r\npasture to a few miserable cattle.' In a single hamlet this writer found\r\n35 poor families feeding 22 cows and 220 sheep on 1,100 arpents of\r\ncommon land! I believe there are philanthropists in England and Scotland\r\nwho think the enclosure and cultivation of common lands a crime against\r\nhumanity; and it would be edifying to listen to a 'conference' between\r\nthem and the shrewd, prosperous small farmers and gardeners who are\r\ntilling these great spaces to-day in the Ile-de-France. One of the few\r\nplainly advantageous results of the headlong Revolution of 1789 was the\r\ntransfer into many private hands of the immense estates which were held\r\nby the abbeys and the clergy in and around Paris; and this transfer\r\nmight perfectly well have been brought about by steady and systematic\r\nmeans without shaking the foundations of property and of order. We might\r\nthen have seen throughout France what we see in England--the gradual and\r\npacific evolution of a great industrial and commercial society on lines\r\nnot contradicting, but conforming to, the traditions of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the capital, of course, has had much to do with the\r\nextraordinary development in these regions of all kinds of horticulture.\r\nNurseries, kitchen-gardens, flower-gardens occupy an increasing area of\r\nthe Ile-de-France, and a constantly growing proportion of its\r\ninhabitants. M. Baudrillart says that in the single Department of the\r\nSeine-et-Oise this proportion has increased tenfold since 1860, and he\r\nputs it down for that Department in 1880 at 50,000 persons out of a\r\ntotal population of 577,798.\r\n\r\nThe proportions can hardly, I should think, be much smaller in the\r\nDepartments of the Aisne and of the Oise. How much this industry adds to\r\nthe beauty of the country I need not say. Its influence is shown in a\r\nnotable increase of the love of flowers among the population generally.\r\nThe English villages no longer have the monopoly which they certainly\r\nonce had of flower-plots before and around the cottages, and of plants\r\ncarefully tended and blooming in the cottage windows. Years ago Dickens\r\nused to say that London was the only capital in the world in which you\r\ncould count upon seeing something green and growing somewhere, no matter\r\nhow gloomy otherwise might be the quarter into which you strolled. This\r\nis beginning to be true of not a few French towns and cities, while the\r\nconditions of successful horticulture, in its various branches, give the\r\naspect of a garden to the rural regions in which it flourishes. The\r\nnursery gardens, which are the most extensive, seldom cover more than\r\neight hectares; seed gardens range in extent from half a hectare to a\r\nhectare; the fruit gardens from half a hectare to two hectares; the\r\ngardeners who send up 'cut flowers' to market usually concentrate their\r\nactivity upon half a hectare of soil. These cultivators are all\r\ncapitalists in a small way, the least important of them requiring a\r\ncapital of from four to five hundred pounds sterling. And land so\r\nemployed is very often let on leases of three, six, or nine years, at\r\nthirty-five pounds a hectare.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing that what may be called the 'Home Departments' of\r\nFrance around Paris should be so much richer in these highly-developed\r\nand remunerative forms of cultivation than the home counties of England\r\naround London. Why should flowers, fruits, and vegetables, as a rule, be\r\nso much better, so much cheaper, and so much more plentiful in the\r\nFrench than in the English capital? The superiority of the French\r\nmarkets cannot arise wholly from a difference of climate. Great risks\r\nare run in this respect by the horticulturists of Picardy and the\r\nIle-de-France. M. Baudrillart tells a story of a large flower-gardener\r\nin the Seine-et-Oise who, during the severe winter of 1879-80, found his\r\ngardens deep in snow one morning, and, upon examining them, carefully\r\nmade up his mind that he stood to lose nearly 2,500_l._ sterling worth\r\nof his best plants. That same evening he left for England, brought back\r\neleven waggon-loads of plants to supply the place of those killed by the\r\ncold, and, by the spring, not only covered his losses but made a profit.\r\n\r\nWith its 'polygon' and its promenades the little city of La Fère, set in\r\nthe midst of well-tilled and fertile fields, has a martial air which\r\nharmonises with its history. During the religious wars which ended with\r\nthe coronation of Henry of Navarre, this small Catholic stronghold was\r\nbesieged, taken, and retaken no fewer than four times in twenty years;\r\nand, if we may believe an old sixteenth-century local ballad, the\r\nHuguenots behaved in a way which showed that the 'Reformation' had not\r\nimproved their morals. The 'Déploration des Dames de la ville de La Fère\r\ntenues forcément par les ennemis de la religion catholique' draws a\r\ndoleful picture of life in a conquered city three centuries ago.\r\n\r\n  Est-ce pas bien chose assez déplorable\r\n  De voir (hélas) son haineux à sa table\r\n  Rire, chanter et vivre opulément\r\n  De ce qu'avions gardé soigneusement?\r\n  En nostre lict quand il veut il se couche,\r\n  Faict nos maris aller à l'escarmouche\r\n  Ou à la brèche, enconstre notre foy,\r\n  Pour résister à Jésus et au Roy.\r\n\r\nThere are soldiers enough in La Fère to-day, for it is an artillery\r\nstation, as it was when Napoleon got his training here, but the peace of\r\nthe picturesque little fortress-town is less troubled by them than by\r\nthe politicians. A little local newspaper published here, which I bought\r\nof an urchin at the uninviting but thriving station of Tergnier, was\r\nfull of paragraphs deriding and denouncing the clergy, which might have\r\nbeen inspired by that model patriot and philanthropist Curtius, who\r\nproposed in the year one of the Republic that the Government should make\r\na bargain with the Deys of Tunis and Algiers to ransom the French held\r\nas slaves in those countries, exchanging them for French priests 'at the\r\nrate of three priests for one patriot'!\r\n\r\n'What sort of a newspaper is this?' I asked a cheery, red-faced old man,\r\nwell and substantially dressed, and, as he afterwards informed me, a\r\ncattle-breeder and dealer on his way from Amiens to Laon.\r\n\r\n'That journal, Monsieur?' he replied with a kind of 'sniff': 'that leaf?\r\nIt is a cabbage-leaf, Monsieur!' 'C'est une feuille de choux!' As for\r\nhimself he was a Republican--no, not a Boulangist--but he had voted for\r\nBoulanger, and he would vote for him again. There must be an end of all\r\nthose taxes. It was too strong. The land could not pay them. In his\r\ncountry a farm worth 30,000 francs eight years ago, to-day would not\r\nsell for 20,000 francs. The farms that were mortgaged would not pay the\r\namount of the mortgages. Look at the taxes on cattle! These free-traders\r\nat Paris want to drive us out of our markets with meat on the hoof, and\r\nkilled meat, from all the ends of the world. Here they are trying to\r\npatch up that treaty of commerce with Italy, and bring back all those\r\ncompeting cattle from Sardinia. That's a pretty idea! and for those\r\nItalians, who owe France everything and now lick the boots of M. de\r\nBismarck. And now the Paris Chamber of Commerce wants an International\r\nCongress on treaties of commerce. The devil take the treaties of\r\ncommerce!'\r\n\r\nAt the station of La Fère I found waiting for me, one lovely morning in\r\nJuly, the _coupé_ of M. Henrivaux, the director of the famous and\r\nhistorical glassworks of St.-Gobain. When Arthur Young visited these\r\nworks in 1787, he found them turning out, in the midst of extensive\r\nforests, 'the largest mirrors in the world.' The forests are less\r\nextensive now, but St.-Gobain still turns out the largest mirrors in the\r\nworld. To this year's Exposition in Paris it has sent the most gigantic\r\nmirror ever made, showing a surface of 31.28 mètres; and the glory of\r\nSt.-Gobain is nightly proclaimed to the world at Paris by the electric\r\nlight which, from the summit of the Eiffel Tower, flashes out over the\r\ngreat city and the valley of the Seine an auroral splendour of\r\nfar-darting rays, thanks to St.-Gobain and to the largest lens ever made\r\nby man.\r\n\r\nSt.-Gobain, however, has other claims upon attention than its\r\nunquestioned rank as the most important seat of one of the most\r\ncharacteristic and important manufactures of our modern civilisation. In\r\na most interesting paper upon the life and labours of M. Augustin\r\nCochin, one of the most useful as well as one of the most distinguished\r\nof the many useful and distinguished Frenchmen whose names are\r\nassociated with this great industry, M. de Falloux describes the works\r\nof St.-Gobain as 'an industrial flower upon a seignorial stalk springing\r\nfrom a feudal root.'\r\n\r\nThe description is both terse and pregnant. The history of this great\r\nand flourishing industry, stretching back now over two centuries and a\r\nhalf, is a history of evolution without revolution.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in France more thoroughly French than St.-Gobain,\r\nnothing which has suffered less from the successive Parisian earthquakes\r\nof the past century, nothing which has preserved through them all more\r\nof what was good in its original constitution and objects. The\r\nestablishment is like a green old oak, and, to borrow a phrase from\r\nWordsworth, its days have been joined each to each 'by natural piety.'\r\nThe place which it first took through privilege and favour, and could\r\nhave taken in no other way, it has kept ever since for nearly two\r\ncenturies and a half, and now holds by virtue of skill, energy, and that\r\neternal vigilance which is both the price and the penalty of free\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe 'Knights of Labour' in our America of to-day put the cart before the\r\nhorse when they undertake to make labourers knights. The Middle Ages\r\nknew better, and went to work in a wiser fashion by making knights\r\nlabourers. As early as the thirteenth century the glassworkers of France\r\nhad great privileges granted them, and an old proverb explains this by\r\ntelling us that 'to make a gentleman glassworker--_un gentilhomme\r\nverrier_--you must first get a gentleman.' As soon as it was established\r\nthat by going into such a costly and artistic industry as this, a\r\ngentleman did not derogate from his rank, the first important step was\r\ntaken towards the emancipation of industry. The glassworkers were\r\nexempted from _tailles, aydes et subsides_, from _ost, giste,\r\nchevaulchier et subventions_, or, in other words, military taxes could\r\nnot be levied upon them, nor troops quartered upon them, nor\r\nrequisitions made upon them. The _gentilhomme verrier_ had the right to\r\ncarry a sword and to wear embroideries, to fish and to hunt, nor could\r\nthe lord of a domain refuse to him, in return for a small fee, the right\r\nto cut whatever wood he needed for his furnaces, and to collect and burn\r\nthe undergrowth into ashes for his manufacture. It was the richly and\r\ndensely wooded country about St.-Gobain which led to the establishment\r\nat this spot in 1665 of the glassworks since developed into the great\r\nestablishment of our day. Even now, though gas has long since taken the\r\nplace of wood in the manufacture, and towns and farms have grown up in\r\nthe neighbourhood, no less than 2,440 hectares of the 2,900 which make\r\nup the territory of St.-Gobain proper are still in woodland; and the\r\nforests extend far beyond the limits of the commune which bears the\r\nname of the Irish Catholic prince St.-Gobain, who came here in the\r\nseventh century, as St. Boniface went to the Rhine, to evangelise the\r\ncountry, and built himself a cell on the side of the mountain which\r\noverlooks the glassworks. Here he did his appointed work, and here, on\r\nJune 2, 670, he was put to death. The mountain was then known as Mount\r\nEreme or Mount Desert, and it is still heavily wooded throughout almost\r\nits whole extent.\r\n\r\nThe French Government also owns a very large domain around and beyond\r\nSt.-Gobain, about two-thirds, I am told, of the 10,000 hectares\r\nconstituting thirteen per cent. of the whole area of the Department of\r\nthe Aisne, which are still covered with forests.[6] These ten thousand\r\nhectares are the remnant of the immense _sylvacum_ of the Laonnois, the\r\nAndradawald of Eastern Gaul, through which Agrippa opened a great Roman\r\nroad connecting the capital of the world by way of Milan, Narbonnese\r\nGaul, Reims, and Soissons with the British Channel. At a short distance\r\nfrom St.-Gobain a part of this ancient road running from south to north\r\nthrough the lower forests of Coucy, is still in use, and is known by the\r\nname of Queen Brunehild's Causeway. The chronicle of St.-Bertin, cited\r\nby Bergier, attributes to that extraordinary woman the restoration of\r\nthis whole road throughout Gaul, and she certainly built a magnificent\r\nabbey in the immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n    [6] The total revenue derived from the woods and forests of the\r\n    State in France is set down in the Budget for 1890 at 25,614,300\r\n    francs, but the returns are 'lumped' and not given in detail. I am\r\n    told that the forests around St.-Gobain yield about 400,000 francs\r\n    of this revenue.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the wise administration of Colbert, an association of\r\nglassworkers established itself at St.-Gobain in 1665 under the\r\ndirection of a 'gentleman glassworker,' M. du Noyer. Twenty years\r\nafterwards, in 1688, a Norman 'gentleman glassworker,' M. Lucas de\r\nNehou, who had joined this association, invented the process known as\r\nthe _coulage_ of glass for mirrors, and this became the kernel of the\r\ngreat industry of St.-Gobain. The association took the name, in 1688, of\r\nthe Thévart company, from De Nehou's most active colleague. It became\r\nthe Plastrier Company in 1702, and ten years afterwards, in 1712, M.\r\nGeoffrin, the husband of the clever and enterprising friend of Voltaire\r\nand the Empress Catherine, took charge as administrator of the\r\nestablishment. His wife really administered both the establishment and\r\nM. Geoffrin. It was she who confided the direction of the works in 1739\r\nto M. Deslandes, and she is fairly entitled to her share of credit for\r\nthe great progress made in the subsequent half-century down to 1789.\r\nUnder the First Consulate St.-Gobain had to give up the privileges it\r\nhad enjoyed and face the modern conditions of success. It has proved its\r\nclaim to its ancient privileges by its triumphs ever since it\r\nsurrendered them. The history of its relations with the crown and with\r\nthe courts under the _ancien régime_ is a most curious, interesting, and\r\ninstructive chapter of the political and social, as well as of the\r\nindustrial, annals of France, and it has been admirably told by M.\r\nAugustin Cochin in his book on the manufactory of St.-Gobain from 1665\r\nto 1866.\r\n\r\nA drive of less than an hour through a highly cultivated rolling\r\ncountry, made attractive by well-grown trees and luxuriant hedgerows,\r\nbrought me to the clear, bright, prosperous-looking town of St.-Gobain.\r\nIts two thousand inhabitants owe their well-being, in one form or\r\nanother, to the great company, and among the most comfortable as well as\r\nthe most picturesque dwellings in the place are the houses built by the\r\ncompany, and conceded on very favourable terms to the families of men\r\nemployed in the works. Piles of timber attested the activity of the\r\nforest administration. The people I passed, singly or in groups, saluted\r\nthe director's carriage in a friendly, good-natured way, which seemed to\r\nshow that here, at least, the 'irrepressible conflict' between capital\r\nand labour has not yet passed into the acute stage. A fine old church of\r\nthe thirteenth century, with a tower of the sixteenth, and the noble\r\ntrees which cover the slopes and shade the roadway of St.-Gobain, are no\r\nmore in keeping with the standard English and American type of a\r\nmanufacturing town than is the parklike domain in the midst of which\r\nrise the main buildings of the great manufactory itself.\r\n\r\nThere M. Henrivaux gave me a cordial welcome. The château of St.-Gobain,\r\nin which the offices of the company have long been established, is a\r\nvast square edifice of the time and the style of Louis XIV. It occupies\r\nthe site, and, I believe, comprises one remaining wing of an earlier\r\nchâteau, which was stormed and partially destroyed by the English in the\r\nfourteenth century. Henry IV. was seigneur of St.-Gobain, and when the\r\nglassworks company, at the end of the seventeenth century, bought the\r\ndomain and the buildings from the Count de Longueval, then governor of\r\nLa Fère, the title of the crown to the property had to be extinguished\r\nas well as his.\r\n\r\nNothing can be finer in its way than the wide panorama of forest-clad\r\nhills and rolling vales, dotted here and there with towns, villages, and\r\nchâteaux, over which you gaze from the terrace in front of this unique\r\nestablishment. It has its pleasure-grounds and its park. Within the main\r\nbuilding, besides the extensive suite of apartments assigned to the\r\ndirector, who resides there with his family, is another handsome suite\r\nof apartments, reserved for the administrators, six in number, whenever\r\nthey may choose, collectively or severally, to visit St.-Gobain. These\r\napartments are furnished with stately simplicity, and the whole interior\r\npreserves the grand air of the eighteenth century. The _fleurs de lis_\r\nstill adorn the lofty chimney-pieces, the waxed floors are sedulously\r\npolished, and, as M. Henrivaux says, could the ghost of Lucas de Nehou\r\nhave returned to St.-Gohain only a year or two ago, he would have been\r\nwelcomed at the entrance gate by a Swiss wearing the royal liveries of\r\nthe House of Bourbon, and resting majestically on his halberd, like the\r\nguards of the Scala Regia in the Vatican. This imposing warden has now\r\npassed away, at the ripe age of a hundred and two, and M. Henrivaux\r\ntells me that he was more alert and active to the last than his more\r\ncelebrated contemporary at Paris, the venerable Chevreuil.\r\n\r\nWhen a new administrator first makes his appearance at St.-Gobain, I am\r\ntold, he is received with music by day and an illumination at night, a\r\ngrand mass is celebrated in the chapel dedicated to the royal Irish\r\nmartyr, and the whole place assumes for a moment the aspect of another\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIn one of the _salons_ of the administration, two pictures commemorate\r\nvisits paid to the manufactory: one, under the Restoration, by the\r\nDuchesse de Berri, the mother of the Count de Chambord; the other, under\r\nthe Second Empire, by the Empress Eugénie--pathetic pictures both,\r\nmaking the room a place wherein to 'sit upon the floor and tell strange\r\nstories of the deaths of kings.'\r\n\r\nBeside the canvas in which the Empress appears--a graceful, gracious\r\nwoman in the prime of her life and her beauty--hangs a small mirror in a\r\ngilded frame, silvered by her own imperial hand in the great workroom\r\nof the manufactory. The work was well and deftly done, but so delicate\r\nis the process that when the light strikes athwart this mirror at a\r\nparticular angle, you can clearly trace a faint hair line of shadow\r\ntraversing it, the ineffaceable record of a ripple of laughter which\r\nbroke from the Empress's lips at some gay remark made by one of the\r\npersonages grouped about her while her hand was completing its task.\r\n\r\nI spent a delightful day with M. and Mme. Henrivaux, inspecting all\r\nparts of the manufactory of mirrors, visiting the houses provided for a\r\nconsiderable number of the workmen and their families, on terms most\r\nadvantageous to them by the company, and inquiring into the working of\r\nthe co-operative association founded by M. Cochin.\r\n\r\nThis association is an association of consumers only, not of producers.\r\nIts original statutes were drawn up very carefully by M. Cochin, and as\r\nthey have been as carefully observed by the members and the managers, it\r\nis the opinion of M. Henrivaux that the experiment has proved to be a\r\nsuccess. This may be inferred from the fact that the title of\r\n'co-operative' has been assumed in the town of St.-Gobain by a bakery,\r\nwhich seems to be managed on the principles of private competition under\r\nthe 'co-operative' flag. If the 'trademark' were not popular, it would\r\nhardly have been assumed.\r\n\r\nThe company also encourages societies among its own workmen and in the\r\ntown for educational purposes, including a philharmonic and a choral\r\nsociety, and is liberal in its expenditure upon the schools, both here\r\nand at Chauny, the seat of its very important chemical works.\r\n\r\nAt St.-Gobain alone, I understand, it is now making an outlay of some\r\nsixty thousand francs on new school-buildings, which is a larger sum\r\nthan the total of the taxes paid by the people of the place. The\r\n'budget' of the commune amounts to 27,500 francs, or rather more than\r\nten francs _per capita_ of the population. Obviously the prosperity of\r\nthe glassworks makes the prosperity of St.-Gobain, which, but for them,\r\nwould doubtless soon relapse into the proportions of the little hamlet\r\ngathered, twelve hundred years ago, by the Irish evangelist about the\r\nmiraculous fountain, which is said to have been evoked by him with a\r\nblow of his staff, and which still flows beneath the shelter of his\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur Young visited St.-Gobain a hundred years ago he\r\ncongratulated himself on his 'good luck' in hitting upon a day when the\r\nfurnaces were in full blast and the _coulage_ going on. A traveller of\r\nthe present day who should reach St.-Gobain armed with the letters of\r\nintroduction necessary to secure his admission into the works, and find\r\nthe furnaces not in full blast and the _coulage_ not going on, would be\r\nin very bad luck indeed.\r\n\r\nFor while in 1789 St.-Gobain was a privileged company, enjoying, for the\r\noutput of its works here and in Normandy, and in the Faubourg\r\nSt.-Antoine at Paris, a chartered monopoly, the output of its works\r\nto-day, under the wholesome pressure of competition with a fair field\r\nand no favour, is enormously greater than it was a century ago, both in\r\nvolume and in value; and the position of St.-Gobain among the glassworks\r\nof the world is at least as high under the presidency of the Duc de\r\nBroglie, in 1889, as it was under the presidency of the Duc de\r\nMontmorency in 1789. Yet the company is still administered, not indeed\r\naccording to the letter of its original statutes of the time of the\r\nGrand Monarque, but in the spirit of those statutes. It is an ancient\r\ndynasty which has simply accepted the changed conditions of modern life\r\nand modern activity, and conformed its operations to them without\r\nabandoning its fundamental principles. The successful advance of this\r\ngreat industry, through all the changes, convulsions, and developments\r\nof the past century, is quite as instructive as are the successive\r\ncatastrophes of French politics during the same time. 'I think,' said M.\r\nHenrivaux to me, 'that when you compare the St.-Gobain of 1702 with the\r\nSt.-Gobain of 1889, you will perhaps agree with me that there is some\r\nforce in our double motto, 'tradition dans le progrès et hérédité dans\r\nl'honneur.'\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that Lucas de Nehou, the inventor of plate glass,\r\nwas originally induced by the founders of St.-Gobain to leave his own\r\nestablishment at Tour-la-ville in Normandy and come to their works in\r\nParis, because the Venetian glassworkers who had been invited by Colbert\r\ninto France, refused to instruct the French workmen in their 'art and\r\nmystery.' They could not be blamed for this. Venice was then the\r\nacknowledged headquarters of the glass manufacture, and it was the\r\nunchangeable policy of the 'most serene Republic' to keep all her\r\nsecrets to herself. A fundamental statute ordained that if any artisan\r\nor artist took his art into a foreign country he should be ordered to\r\nreturn. If he did not obey, his nearest relatives were to be imprisoned,\r\nin order that his affection for them might lead him to submit. If he\r\nsubmitted, his emigration should be forgiven, and he should be\r\nestablished in his industry at Venice. If he did not submit, a person\r\nwas sent after him to kill him, and after he was well and duly killed\r\nhis relatives were to be released. In the thirteenth century Venetian\r\nartists suffered death under this statute in Bologna, Florence, Mantua,\r\nand other Italian cities. Even in Venice the glassworks were rigidly\r\nconfined to the island of Murano, in order to keep the workmen from\r\ncoming into contact with strangers visiting the city. When the Republic,\r\nin 1665, as a matter of policy allowed a certain number of glassworkers\r\nto go to France, at the request of Colbert, and to take service there\r\nunder Du Noyer at Paris, in his manufactory of mirrors, these workmen\r\nwere forbidden to teach their trade to any Frenchman. The result, as I\r\nhave said, was that Du Noyer finally brought about a combination with M.\r\nde Nehou, the owner of certain glassworks at Tour-la-ville in Normandy,\r\nthat De Nehou came to Paris, that out of their joint enterprise\r\neventually arose the company now known as the Company of St.-Gobain,\r\nthat the French workmen trained by De Nehou did excellent work, and that\r\nDe Nehou put himself in the way of making, towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, his invention of plate glass, which finally drove\r\nVenetian mirrors out of the markets of the world. The Venetian mirrors,\r\ncharming as they are from the æsthetic point of view of decorative art,\r\nare simply blown glass rolled flat, cut, polished, and tinned. The art\r\nof making them came, like other arts, to Venice from the East, and in\r\nthe sixteenth century the Venetian mirror was the true 'glass of\r\nfashion' all over Europe. The famous 'Galerie des Glaces' at Versailles,\r\nof which Louis XIV. was so proud, was filled up with mirrors of 'French\r\nmanufacture after the fashion of Venice,' as the royal expense-rolls\r\nstate, and it took De Nehou and his workmen five years--from 1678 to\r\n1683--to do the work. Eight years afterwards, in 1691, he presented King\r\nLouis with certain 'large mirrors of plate glass,' the firstfruits of\r\nhis invention, made in 1689. In 1693, he was made Director of the 'Royal\r\nManufactory of Grand Mirrors,' and the manufactory was established in\r\nthe ruined Château de St.-Gobain.\r\n\r\nA hundred years afterwards, in 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte occupied Venice\r\nwith a French army and made an end of that 'most serene' republic, as he\r\ndid, not long afterwards, of the least serene republic at Paris. He put\r\nBerthier in command, and a commission of French savants, of which\r\nBerthollet was a member, proceeded to pick the locks and investigate the\r\nmysteries of Venetian art. Their report upon the Venetian glassworks was\r\nto the effect that France knew more about the matter than Venice. 'The\r\nindustries of Venice,' said these irreverent conquerors, 'as precocious\r\nas the industries of China, have stood still like them.'\r\n\r\nIn this age of jointstock companies and limited liabilities, it may be\r\ninteresting to see on what terms the original founders of the Company of\r\nSt.-Gobain put their heads and their purses together, to establish a\r\ngreat industrial enterprise. Their articles of association were signed\r\nby twelve associates on February 1, 1703, some ten years after William\r\nPaterson and Lord Halifax laid the foundations of the Bank of England\r\nand of the British public debt. The capital of the company, estimated at\r\n2,040,000 livres, was divided into twenty-four shares of 85,000 livres\r\neach, called 'sols,' and these again into twelve parts each, called\r\n'deniers,' making a total of 288 'deniers.' These curious designations,\r\ntaken from the currency of the time, were used down to the overthrow of\r\nthe restored Bourbon monarchy in 1830. The owners of these shares, or\r\n'deniers,' bound themselves solemnly never to make a loan, but to meet\r\nall the expenses of the enterprise by assessments in proportion to their\r\nholdings, and always to keep in hand a fund for current expenses of at\r\nleast one million of livres. They were to receive ten per cent. on their\r\ncapital, a special honorarium of 1,000 livres a year apiece, and a fee\r\nof two crowns for attendance at meetings. All misunderstandings were to\r\nbe settled by arbitration, and all the proceedings were to be secret.\r\nUnder these articles St.-Gobain grew up, prospered, withstood the shock\r\nof successive political revolutions in France, and kept its place in the\r\nfront of the great industrial movement of the nineteenth century down to\r\nthe year 1830.\r\n\r\nDuring this long life of over a century and a quarter, the payment of\r\ndividends seems to have been suspended for three years only, and that\r\nafter the Terror, from 1794 to 1797. In 1792, when the Girondins and the\r\nJacobins were tearing France to pieces between them, and courting\r\nforeign invasion as a stimulus to domestic anarchy, the works were\r\nstopped for a time in Paris, at Tour-la-ville and at St.-Gobain, but\r\nonly for a time. The very able director of the company, M. Deslandes,\r\noriginally selected, as I have said, by Madame Geoffrin, and who had\r\nvindicated her good judgment by managing the affairs of the company with\r\nsuccess for thirty years, resigned his post in 1789. He was a model\r\ndisciplinarian of the old school.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, finding that some of the workmen at Tour-la-ville had been\r\nseduced from their duty by a glassmaker at La Fère-en-Tardenois, M.\r\nDeslandes called upon the Intendant at Soissons to clap them into\r\nprison. Turgot, the friend of Franklin, objected to this, but M.\r\nDeslandes gave him plainly to understand that 'a government which should\r\ntolerate such misconduct would be detestable.'\r\n\r\nWhen a great mirror was to be cast at St.-Gobain, M. Deslandes always\r\ntook command of the works in full dress, his peruke well powdered and\r\nhis sword by his side. Clearly such a director as this was out of\r\nkeeping with a king who would not let his officers fire upon a howling\r\nmob, and who put on a red cap to oblige a swarm of drunken ruffians.\r\n\r\nM. Deslandes was followed into retirement by several of the\r\nadministrators of the company, who emigrated, and in 1793 the Republic\r\ncaused the cashier of the company, M. Guérin, to be guillotined on the\r\nheinous charge of corresponding with his former employers and friends\r\nbeyond the frontier. Naturally this crime was committed, like so many\r\nsimilar crimes of that day, with an eye to the main chance. The shares\r\nof the administrators who had emigrated were confiscated, in the names\r\nof Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and the confiscators sent sundry\r\n'patriots' to sit on the administrative council of the company. Their\r\nincompetency was so ludicrous and mischievous that Robespierre,\r\nrepresenting the State which had thus stolen an interest in the\r\nenterprise, could not stand it. He actually 'requisitioned' two\r\nnoblemen--two 'aristocrats'--among the as yet undisturbed owners of the\r\nproperty, to come forward and direct it, just as the leader of a\r\nsuccessful mutiny of convicts on board of a transport might\r\n'requisition' the deposed captain and mate of the vessel to carry her\r\nsafely through a storm!\r\n\r\nWith the return of law and order in the person of the Corsican conqueror\r\nthings resumed their normal course at St.-Gobain; and as I have already\r\nsaid, the company flourished under its old organisation down to the\r\nestablishment of the Monarchy of July. Then the owners of the 'deniers'\r\nput themselves and their property under the general Civil Code, in the\r\nform of what is called in modern France a 'société anonyme,' and at the\r\nfirst general meeting of the 'société' in April 1831 the accounts of 128\r\nyears, over which no question had ever arisen among the representatives\r\nof the original holders, were presented and approved. Certainly this\r\nmust be admitted to be a most noteworthy case of 'l'hérédité dans\r\nl'honneur.'\r\n\r\nThe new 'société' has greatly extended and strengthened its operations\r\nsince 1831. The works at Tour-la-ville have been abandoned, the site\r\nsold, and the workmen transferred to St.-Gobain. The glassworks of\r\nSt.-Quirin, the proprietors of which, on the abolition in 1804 of\r\nprivileges in general, had taken to making plate glass, were taken over\r\nin 1858 by the St.-Gobain company, together with certain other works at\r\nMannheim in Germany and the chemical works at Cirey, and the 'société'\r\nassumed the name under which it is now known of 'The Company of Mirrors\r\nand Chemical Products of St.-Gobain, Chauny, and Cirey.' In 1863 it\r\nbought up the works at Stolberg near Aix-la-Chapelle in Rhenish Prussia,\r\nin 1868 a minor manufactory at Montluçon in the Department of the\r\nAllier, and finally during this current year 1889 it is establishing a\r\nmanufactory at Pisa in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the company, as it now exists, extend to six\r\nmanufactories of mirrors, six manufactories of chemicals, a mine of iron\r\npyrites, a salt mine, many thousand hectares of forests in this\r\ndepartment of the Aisne and in the province of Lorraine, and to a local\r\nrailway connecting St.-Gobain with Chauny, where the plate glass cast at\r\nSt.-Gobain is polished and the mirrors are silvered. At St.-Gobain,\r\nbesides the plate glass mirrors, glass is made for roofs, for floors,\r\nfor pavements, for optical instruments, including the finest lenses used\r\nin the lighthouses of France. Here, as I have said, the lens was made\r\nnow used at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, from which, night\r\nafter night, a gigantic auroral ray of electric light leaps into space\r\nand shoots for miles athwart the sky, to the inexpressible delight of\r\nthe gaping crowds below, and I hope to the edification of the world of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nSince 1870 the output of the company from its various manufactories has\r\nmore than doubled. It now amounts, in round numbers, to 800,000 square\r\nmètres a year of polished plate glass; to 500,000 square mètres a year\r\nof rough glass; to a million kilogrammes a year of blocks and castings\r\nfor floors and roofings, and to eighty thousand kilogrammes a year of\r\noptical glasses of all sorts.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Louis XIV. and before Lucas de Nehou had made his\r\ninvention of plate glass, there was absolutely no public demand for what\r\nin those days were called 'large mirrors' made in the Venetian fashion,\r\nmirrors which to-day would not find a market in the most remote frontier\r\ntowns of America or Australia. Colbert then wrote to the Comte d'Avaux\r\napropos of the works of Lucas de Nehou in Normandy, that 'there was\r\nabsolutely no market for large mirrors in the kingdom, the king being\r\nthe only person who could possibly need them!'\r\n\r\nThis was in 1673.\r\n\r\nIn 1702, ten years after the invention of the process by which plate\r\nglass is made, a mirror with a surface area of one mètre cost 165\r\nfrancs. In 1889 such a mirror costs 30 f. 25 c. A mirror with four\r\nmètres of surface area cost, in 1702, 2,750 francs. In 1889 it costs 136\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nWhen we come down to modern times and to the much larger mirrors\r\nproduced of late years, the fall in prices is extraordinary. In 1873 a\r\nmirror with ten square mètres of surface cost 1,200 francs. To-day such\r\na mirror can be bought at St.-Gobain for 467 francs, showing a fall of\r\nnearly two-thirds in price within sixteen years!\r\n\r\nTo-day the total production of polished plate glass in the world is\r\nestimated as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                  square mètres\r\n  England (4 companies)                 900,000\r\n  Belgium (6 companies)                 600,000\r\n  Germany (4 companies)                 150,000\r\n  United States (7 companies)           500,000\r\n  France (not including St.-Gobain)     130,000\r\n  St.-Gobain                            800,000\r\n                                      ---------\r\n    Total                             3,080,000\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that nearly one quarter of the plate glass of\r\na world in which plate glass, like champagne, is rapidly ceasing to be a\r\nluxury and becoming a necessity, is produced at this ancient\r\nestablishment. With a keen perception of the tendencies of this age\r\nSt.-Gobain, of late years, has been fitting its machinery to produce the\r\nvery largest plates of glass possible to be made. Go where you like,\r\nfrom the Eden Theatre in Paris to the Casino of Monte Carlo, from the\r\nnew monster hotel at the Gare St.-Lazare to the enormous edifice which\r\nan enterprising firm of tradesmen has planted in the centre of the Corso\r\nat Rome, and the vast glittering sheets of silvered glass turned out\r\nfrom the great forges everywhere confront you. At the French Exposition\r\nof 1878 St.-Gobain enabled the 'fly gobblers' of two hemispheres to\r\nadmire themselves in the most gigantic mirror ever made down to that\r\ndate. It measured six mètres and a half in height, by four mètres and\r\neleven centimètres in width, which gave it a surface area of 26 mètres\r\n12 centimètres. Naturally M. Henrivaux determined to surpass this\r\nprodigy in 1889, and to match the Eiffel Tower with a mirror. The\r\nBelgian rivals of St.-Gobain suspected this, it seems, and sent forth\r\nsubtle persons to spy out the plans of the great French manufactory.\r\nThese colossal plates of glass are cast upon immense 'tables' of metal,\r\nand by ascertaining the dimensions of the tables ordered for St.-Gobain\r\nthe ingenious Belgians hoped to get the measure of the effort it would\r\nbe necessary for them to outdo. In anticipation of this subtlety the\r\ndirector of St.-Gobain ordered two immense tables, and when these were\r\nsent to the manufactory, had them skilfully thrown into one. Upon the\r\ngigantic table thus prepared the grand mirror of the Exposition of 1889\r\nwas cast at the eleventh hour. This mirror was the special delight of\r\nthe Shah of Persia during his visit of this year to Paris; and as I\r\nsuppose the seven plate-glass manufactories which have grown up in my\r\nown beloved country under the benediction of the Protective Tariff,\r\nsince a prohibitive duty was originally clapped on plate glass to\r\nencourage the one solitary establishment of the sort then existing in\r\nAmerica, will give themselves up to producing something more stupendous\r\nstill for the New York Exposition of 1892, I here set down its\r\ndimensions. It measures in height 7 mètres 63 centimètres, and in width\r\n4 mètres 10 centimètres, giving it a superficial area of 34 mètres 24\r\ncentimètres. It is 12 millimètres thick, and weighs 940 kilogrammes.\r\nThis enormous glass was cast from a single crucible, containing 1,600\r\nkilogrammes of vitreous matter. To have seen this operation would have\r\nbeen worth a very much longer journey than that from New York to\r\nSt.-Gobain, for the colour and glow of such a mass of vitreous matter in\r\nfusion can only be matched by the evanescent hues of a crimson aurora on\r\na fine night in the North, or by the intense lights which play over the\r\nsurface of a stream of molten lava.\r\n\r\nAt every stage in the operation the utmost skill and delicacy of\r\nhandling are required to convert what might easily pass for a heap of\r\nrubbish swept together from a macadamised roadway into the smooth,\r\nglittering, lustrous plate which the French so picturesquely call a\r\n_glace_, and which indeed most nearly resembles the evenly frozen\r\nsurface of a crystal lakelet. These sands, silicates, chalks, and\r\ncarbonates--rough contributions from Oken's 'silent realm of the\r\nminerals'--are first crushed and mingled together by machines--one of\r\nthe best of them, I was glad to hear, of American invention--then passed\r\non into the great rectangular hall, in which they are shot into the\r\ncrucibles of the melting furnaces and fused, mainly by gas, on a system\r\ninvented and perfected by the late Dr. Siemens, I believe, who made such\r\na stir a decade ago at Glasgow by his discourse on the storage of force\r\nbefore the British Association. The furnaces which, according to their\r\nvarying capacity, now require from eight to ten tons of coal a day,\r\nconsumed, before the development of the Siemens system, from sixteen to\r\ntwenty tons. Twenty-four hours now suffice for the fusion and the\r\ncasting of the glass, and if the casting were now to be conducted as\r\nceremoniously as in the time of that fine old martinet M. Deslandes, M.\r\nHenrivaux would pass his life in a cocked hat, knee-breeches, peruke,\r\nembroidered coat, and sword, for the casting now takes place every day\r\nand at a fixed hour. None the less, rather the more, it is a work still\r\nof extreme nicety, one to be done by experts, who must be as cool as\r\nsoldiers under fire. In a certain way and measure it is like ladling out\r\nthe molten lava of Vesuvius and pressing it into slabs for a lady's\r\ntoilette-table. The plates, once cast, must be smoothed and made even.\r\nThis is a very pretty process, and used to be performed by machines\r\nwhich bore the very pretty names of _valseuses_. That paviour's rammers\r\nshould be called _demoiselles_ has always seemed to me an outrage and an\r\nimpertinence, though I may suppose it finds its excuse in the\r\nshort-waisted costumes of our grandmothers. But the movement of the\r\nglass-smoothing _valseuses_ was really a sort of waltz movement. The\r\nplates of glass were fixed with plaster on a solid rectangular table.\r\nGranite-dust was scattered upon the plates, and then a wooden plateau,\r\narmed on the under side with bands of cast iron or steel, was set to\r\nwaltzing over it backwards and forwards with a semi-rotatory motion, the\r\ngranite-dust supplied becoming finer and finer as the waltzing went on.\r\n\r\nInstead of these _valseuses_ two great plates of glass are now fixed\r\nside by side with plaster on huge tables, and two large ashlars are set\r\nturning by steam on their own axes while they describe a great orbit\r\nover the plates of glass. A stream of water constantly plays upon the\r\nplates, which are also constantly powdered with fine sand. The ashlars\r\nturn on their axes thirty or forty times a minute, and the plates of\r\nglass are usually smoothed and 'evened' on both faces now by these\r\nmachines in from eight to nine hours, including the time spent in taking\r\nthem out of the plaster after one face has been smoothed, and fixing\r\nthem anew in the plaster, that the other face may fare as well. Here\r\nagain a considerable economy of time has been made. And, after all, when\r\none looks into the practical production of any of these great marvels of\r\nhuman industry, it is in this economy of time that the real advance of\r\nmodern science beyond the results of ancient invention seems to consist.\r\nWith all our nineteenth-century chorus of 'self-praising,\r\nself-admiring,' where should we be if certain--for the most part,\r\nuncertain and forgotten--men of genius had not invented the primordial\r\nprocesses which made art and civilisation possible? The workshop came\r\nfirst, and was the real marvel in the case of every great industry. To\r\ntalk of the 'invention' of the steam-engine, for example, is an\r\nabsurdity. The 'invention' was the engine, an invention as old as Egypt\r\nor China. The discovery that steam could be made to work the engine is\r\nthe more modest modern achievement. In this industry of glass-making the\r\namazing thing is that it should have come into the mind of a man so to\r\napply the heat of burning wood to sands and silicates enclosed in an\r\nearthen vessel as to convert them into an entirely new substance\r\npossessing qualities not perceivable by any human sense in the sands,\r\nthe silicates, or the earth.\r\n\r\nWhat our modern progress in chemistry and in mechanics has enabled the\r\nmakers of glass to do, is greatly to reduce the trouble and cost of\r\nproducing this entirely new substance, greatly to improve the quality of\r\nthe substance produced, and to extend the range of the uses to which it\r\ncan be applied.\r\n\r\nWhat would the Egyptians, who paid their tribute in glass to Rome, have\r\nthought of a serious order to pave the Via Sacra with blocks of purple\r\nglass? Yet such an order could be executed now at St.-Gobain, and when\r\none sees the great flags weighing nine kilogrammes made here and used to\r\nlet light into the cellarage below the carriage-ways, for example, of\r\nthe huge Hôtel Continental, at Paris, it comes easily within the\r\nprobabilities that the whole underworld of our great cities in time may\r\nthus come to be made available for divers uses, as so much of the\r\nunderworld of Broadway now is in New York.\r\n\r\nThe great 'pavement question' is an open question still, in spite of\r\nasphalte and of wood, and there would seem to be nothing in the nature\r\nof things to prevent its being eventually solved by the glassworkers.\r\nThe roofing question clearly belongs to them. The casting of glass for\r\nroofs began, I believe, with England, in the time of Sir Joseph Paxton,\r\nbut it has been immensely developed at St.-Gobain. Over a hundred\r\nthousand square mètres of glass roofing made here were required for the\r\nbuilding of the Exposition of this year at Paris. All the most important\r\nrailway stations in France, from Nantes to Strasburg (unless the Germans\r\nhave changed this), and from Calais to Marseilles, are thus roofed. In\r\ngreat warehouses, markets, public museums, street galleries--like those\r\nof Victor Emmanuel at Milan--factories, workshops all over France and\r\nthe Continent, this conversion of the roof into a colossal window has\r\nrevolutionised matters within the last twenty years. The light is making\r\nits way even into Turkey, where the great bazaar at Salonica has been\r\nroofed in glass by St.-Gobain, and as the Chinese, who, despite their\r\nearly invention of glass, never got beyond using it for beads and little\r\nbottles, have condescended to admit great French mirrors into the\r\nImperial Palace at Pekin, the glass roof may, ere long, make its way\r\neven into China.\r\n\r\nIn the form of tiles, such as are now made here, glass must inevitably,\r\nsooner or later, displace slates and shingles and terra-cotta for the\r\nroofs, even of private houses, it being quite certain that these glass\r\ntiles can be so used as to give a much better light in the garrets of\r\nprivate houses than can possibly be got through the windows. When that\r\ncomes to pass the burglar's occupation of clambering stealthily from\r\nroof to roof will be seriously interfered with. What with glass roofs\r\nand glass floors and electricity, indeed, the city of the future is\r\nlikely to be much more easily 'policed' and patrolled, as well as\r\nincomparably more cheery and habitable, than the city of to-day.\r\nPerhaps, too, when we all come to living in glass houses, the cause of\r\npeace and good neighbourhood may gain, and even Mrs. Grundy may grow\r\nmore careful about looking into the affairs of her friends and\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nIf that much maligned potentate the Emperor Nero had any real notion of\r\nthe capabilities of glass when he established the first glassworks at\r\nRome, the lamentation with which he took farewell of the world, '_qualis\r\nartifex pereo_,' may have been inspired by regret at his not being\r\nallowed time enough to develop them. Certainly such gigantic mirrors as\r\nthose which St.-Gobain has this year sent to the Exposition would have\r\nshown to better advantage in his colossal 'Golden House' than in any of\r\nour petty modern palaces. In what palace in England or in France to-day\r\ncould a mirror measuring 7 mètres x 63 centimètres in height by 4 mètres\r\nx 12 centimètres in width, and thus displaying a surface of more than 30\r\nsquare mètres, be placed, without dwarfing everything about it? These\r\nimmense and magnificent mirrors must go hereafter to decorate palaces of\r\npublic resort--'palaces of the people,' not palaces of princes. What was\r\na royal luxury when Colbert wrote to D'Avaux in 1673 has become a\r\npopular attraction. The smallest restaurant in Paris would think itself\r\ndiscredited to-day were it decorated with one of the _grandes glaces_\r\nfor which Colbert in 1693 thought St.-Gobain would find no purchaser\r\nsave the king; but the Grand Café and the Hôtel Terminus of the Gare\r\nSt.-Lazare order mirrors in 1889 which no king of our times would very\r\nwell know what to do with.\r\n\r\nYet, once more, how the cost of these mirrors has fallen! In 1702 a\r\nplate-glass mirror showing two square mètres only by surface, cost, at\r\nSt.-Gobain, 540 francs. In 1889 such a mirror, showing four square\r\nmètres of surface, costs, at St.-Gobain, 136 francs. A mirror showing\r\nten square mètres of surface, which could not have been made in 1702 at\r\nany price, can now be had for 467 francs!\r\n\r\nIn 1802, under Napoleon, a mirror showing four square mètres of surface\r\ncost 3,644 francs, or very nearly three times the present cost of a\r\nmirror, not tinned like the mirrors of 1802, but silvered, of twice and\r\na half that size. While new markets are constantly opening to this great\r\nindustry all over the world, the progress of chemical science and of\r\nmechanics is as constantly suggesting new economies and new improvements\r\nin the manufacture of glass, and St.-Gobain, though one of the most\r\nthoroughly French of all French 'institutions,' shows no Chauvinism in\r\nits incessant study and prompt appropriation of these economies and\r\nthese improvements. During the invasion of 1814 the workmen of\r\nSt.-Gobain marched off to Chauny to resist the advance of the Prussians,\r\nand the manufactory had to pay a heavy fine for its patriotism. But it\r\navails itself as readily of German as of French science to-day, and I\r\nfound M. Henrivaux entirely and minutely familiar with the very latest\r\nphenomena of the great change which is coming over the glassworks, as\r\nwell as all the other industries, of Pittsburg, through the use there of\r\nnatural gas instead of coal gas and coal. All the most recently invented\r\nfurnaces--English, German, American--have been tried and tested here as\r\nsoon as they were made; and the latest American 'crushers' and\r\n'regulators' get to St.-Gobain as soon as they do to Pittsburg. The\r\nmaterials which go to the making of a plate-glass mirror pass through\r\nseven processes before the original heap of pebbles, dust, and ashes is\r\ntransformed into a sheet of splendour and light.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago more than ten days were required to complete these\r\nseven processes, from the crushing and mixing and putting into the\r\nfurnace of the soda and the silicious sand and the charcoal and the lime\r\nand the broken glass, called here _calcin_, through the fusion, and the\r\nmoulding, and the squaring, and the smoothing, and the washing, and the\r\npolishing. Now this is all done in half the time--127 hours instead of\r\n246.\r\n\r\nWith all this the condition of the workmen employed at St.-Gobain has\r\nalso steadily improved. It seems always to have been good, relatively to\r\nthe general conditions of workmen in other industries and other\r\nestablishments in France. Under the original statutes, and in the time\r\nof the excellent M. Deslandes, the nominee of Madame Geoffrin, who ruled\r\nSt.-Gobain with great success from 1759 down to the Revolution, the\r\nworkmen of St.-Gobain, as I have shown, were looked after, as well as\r\nkept to their duty, on strictly patriarchal principles, not likely to\r\nfind favour in modern eyes. That they did not themselves dislike the\r\nsystem may be inferred from the fact that no such thing as a strike has\r\never been known at St.-Gobain, and that a considerable proportion of the\r\nworkmen employed here now are the direct descendants of workmen employed\r\nhere in the last century. There are even workers by inheritance, as men\r\nmay be soldiers and sailors or magistrates by inheritance. Of course\r\nwith the great extension in our own time of the operation of the\r\ncompany, great numbers of workmen other than glassworkers have come into\r\nits employment. But in the glass manufactures alone there are now\r\nemployed: at St.-Gobain 375 workmen, at Chauny 583, at Cirey-sur-Vezouze\r\n628, at Montluçon 473, at Stolberg, in Rhenish Prussia, 842, at Waldhof,\r\nin Baden-Baden, 518; making, in all, 3,419.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the workmen are paid by the day, by the month, or by the\r\npiece, according to the special work which they do, but in all cases\r\n(and this, I believe, has been the rule here from the beginning) the\r\nworkman is interested in his work by one premium on the amount, and by\r\nanother on the quality of the work done. Furthermore (and this also\r\ndates from the beginning) the company look after the primary education\r\nof the children of the workmen. At St.-Gobain, at Chauny, at Cirey, at\r\nMontluçon, and I believe, also, at Waldhof, it maintains schools for\r\nboth sexes at its own expense, together with asylums and training\r\nschools for the children. In these there are now more than 1,400\r\nchildren. When the company owns no such school it pays a subvention to\r\nthe nearest school for the benefit of the children of its workmen.\r\n\r\nHere at St.-Gobain the company owns a number of houses, each house\r\nhaving a garden and dependencies, which it lets to the workmen at an\r\naverage rental of eight francs a month. I saw not long ago, at one of\r\nthe stations on a line newly opened by the Great Eastern Railway Company\r\nof England, very neat and even handsome cottages well built of brick and\r\nthoroughly comfortable, which are leased to servants of the company at\r\n2s. 6_d_. a week, or ten shillings a month. The houses I saw at\r\nSt.-Gobain let at less than seven shillings a month, were quite as large\r\nas those of the Great Eastern Company, and the gardens were much larger.\r\n\r\nI gathered from the remarks made to me at St.-Gobain by people who\r\nseemed to be both well-informed and well-disposed, that of late years\r\nthe liberality of the company in regard to these houses has, in not a\r\nfew cases, worked mischief rather than good. They are not confined to\r\nSt.-Gobain, and the company owns and leases no fewer than 1,256 of\r\nthem. A good many allotments of land around the factories are also made\r\nat nominal rates to the workmen, who cultivate them assiduously. The\r\nglass-founders are particularly favoured in making these leases and\r\nallotments. Besides these houses meant for families, the company\r\nprovides lodgings near the factories for unmarried workmen, or for\r\nworkmen whose homes are at a considerable distance from their work.\r\n\r\nWithin the buildings of the manufactory itself at St.-Gobain, M.\r\nHenrivaux showed me some such lodgings, as well as several bath-rooms\r\nwhich the workmen are allowed to use on the payment of a very slight\r\nfee. It is his experience that the workmen prefer to consider the bath\r\nas a luxury, and to pay for it.\r\n\r\nAll the relations between the company and its workmen, indeed, seem to\r\nme to be governed by a sensible avoidance on the part of the company of\r\neverything like fussy paternalism; and to this, in some measure, I have\r\nno doubt, must be attributed the remarkably smooth and easy working of\r\nthese relations through so long a course of years. The workmen are\r\ntreated, not like children, but like reasonable beings, who may be\r\nexpected to avail themselves of advantages which are offered them with\r\nan eye at once to their own interests and to the interests of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe co-operative societies at St.-Gobain and at Chauny, for example,\r\nwere founded in 1866, not by the company, but by the employees of the\r\ncompany under statutes carefully drawn up by M. Cochin, and the company\r\nsimply undertook to assist them; in the first place by leasing them, at\r\na low rent, the buildings necessary for the business, and in the next\r\nplace by taking charge gratuitously of their financial operations. The\r\ngoods supplied are sold only to members of the societies, as in the\r\nco-operative stores in England. The transactions amount to about\r\n1,500,000 francs a year, the goods are sold at prices below those\r\ncharged in the local shops, and the members divide an average annual\r\nprofit of from eight to ten per cent. The management is entirely in the\r\nhands of the members.\r\n\r\nThe company has founded at St.-Gobain a kind of savings-bank in which\r\nthe workman may make deposits of from one franc to 400 francs, drawing\r\ninterest at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, until the maximum is\r\nreached, when the money is either paid back to the depositor or, if he\r\nprefers, invested for him, without charge by the company, in the public\r\nfunds or in railway securities. In this way many of the workmen are\r\ncoming to be small capitalists. If they wish also to become house-owners\r\nthe company advances, at the lowest possible rate of interest, the\r\nnecessary funds for the purchase, and workmen in good standing with the\r\ncompany find no difficulty in getting gratuitous advances of money\r\nrepayable in small fixed amounts, upon showing good reasons for the\r\nadvance. And in all the establishments of the company, except at\r\nMontluçon, where there is a special fund to give assistance in cases of\r\naccident or disease, the workmen and their families are entitled to\r\nmedical advice and medicines at the expense of the company.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all these arrangements for promoting a real community of\r\ninterests between the company and its employees, there is a pension fund\r\nout of which retiring pensions, varying from one-fifth to one-fourth of\r\nthe wages earned by the pensioner, are granted to employees who have\r\nserved the company for a certain number of years, or who find themselves\r\ndisabled from further service by age or by disease. A certain\r\nproportion, determinable by the circumstances of each case, of these\r\npensions is settled upon the widows and young children of the\r\npensioners; and in order to encourage habits of thrift and forecast\r\namong the workmen, the company undertakes to manage without charge the\r\ninvestment of a certain proportion of his wages by any workman in the\r\n'pension fund' of the national government.\r\n\r\nThe total outlay of the company upon these various methods of promoting\r\na community of interests between itself and its employees amounted in\r\n1888 to 438,033 francs, thus divided:--\r\n\r\n                                    francs\r\n  Pensions                          241,657\r\n  Medical Service                   100,055\r\n  Schools and Religious Services     57,788\r\n  Recreations                        17,667\r\n  Gifts and Assistance               19,758\r\n\r\nThe outlay upon 'recreation' is made in the form of subventions and\r\nprizes granted to associations of the workmen, such as shooting and\r\ngymnastic clubs and musical societies. The manufactory, for example,\r\nboasts a philharmonic society of its own, and there is a Choral Society\r\nof St.-Gobain. Both of these have scored successes in various public\r\nexhibitions. There is a rifle club, founded in 1861, and reconstituted\r\nin 1874, with an eye to the possible military necessities of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the company and its employees under this system,\r\nthe germs of which were planted here two centuries ago, have assumed\r\nsuch a character that the workmen habitually speak not of the\r\nmanufactory but of the 'maison.' They are and feel themselves to be\r\nmembers of a great economic family. Of 2,650 persons now actively\r\nemployed in St.-Gobain, Chauny, and Cirey, 432, or 16.3 per cent., have\r\nbeen employed for more than thirty years; 411, or 15.5 per cent., for\r\nmore than twenty and less than thirty years; 553, or 20.9 per cent., for\r\nmore than ten and less than twenty years; and only 1,254, or 47.3 per\r\ncent., for less than ten years.\r\n\r\nIt would be instructive to compare this record with the records of the\r\nmost important industrial establishments in England and America during\r\nthe past thirty years, and I should be glad to see this done by some of\r\nthe people who talk so glibly in England and America of the inherent\r\nfickleness and instability of the French character, as offering an\r\nadequate explanation of the political catastrophes which have so often\r\nrecurred in France during the past century.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious features of the establishment at St.-Gobain is a\r\nsubterranean lake. The fine forests around St.-Gobain and La\r\nFère--forests of oak, beech, elm, ash, birch, maple, yoke-elm, aspen,\r\nwild cherry, linden, elder, and willow--flourish upon a tertiary\r\nformation. The surface of clay keeps the soil marshy and damp, but this\r\nchecks the infiltration of the rainwater and therefore favours the\r\ngrowth of the trees. In the calcareous rock the early inhabitants\r\nhollowed out for themselves caverns, in which they took refuge from\r\ntheir enemies and from the beasts of the forest; and these caverns,\r\ncalled by the people _creuttes_--an obvious corruption of the name of\r\n_crypts_, given them by the Roman conquerors of Gaul, just as the early\r\nFrench trappers gave the name of 'caches' to the Indian hiding-places of\r\nthe Far West--are to be found all about Soissons and Laon. The more\r\nmodern lords of St.-Gobain, its monks and its barons, dug out of the\r\ncalcareous rock the stones which they used to build their châteaux and\r\ntheir churches, and they created great _creuttes_ beneath St.-Gobain. It\r\nseems to have occurred to M. Deslandes, during his long and skilful\r\nsupervision of the works here, that these caverns might be put to the\r\nvery practical use of securing an adequate water-supply. The idea has\r\nbeen thoroughly carried out, and the subterranean reservoir of\r\nSt.-Gobain is much more impressive as a spectacle than the crypts of the\r\nCisterns at Constantinople. It is kept filled to an average depth of one\r\nmètre by the infiltration of the surface waters and by the overflow of a\r\npond, La Marette, on the plateau of St.-Gobain, and it covers an area of\r\nsome 1,200 square mètres.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three hours spent in visiting the various departments of\r\nthe glassworks overhead, M. Henrivaux led me through winding passages,\r\nwhich reminded me of the dismal vomitories at Baiæ, down into this\r\nstrange underworld. Walls and pillars, partly of the natural rock, left\r\nin the working of the quarries, partly of masonry built up to strengthen\r\nthe reservoir, give this weird water, when you reach it, the aspect\r\nrather of a stream than of a lake. A workman, who had preceded and\r\nguided us with a swinging lantern, put out a long boathook, and drew\r\nslowly around to the landing-place a long, shallow boat, into which he\r\ninvited us to step. M. Henrivaux had kindly sent orders in the morning\r\nto have the reservoir illuminated with Venetian and Chinese lanterns of\r\nvarious colours. These had been hung from hooks in the rocks and pillars\r\nwith infinite good taste at long intervals, so as to illuminate not too\r\nbrilliantly the mystical darkness of the scene. Looking upon the vague,\r\nindefinite vista, as it glimmered away into an indefinable distance, one\r\nseemed really to stand\r\n\r\n  Where Alp, the sacred river, ran\r\n  Through caverns measureless by man,\r\n    Down to a shoreless sea.\r\n\r\nSeating ourselves carefully in the boat, our silent boatman, like a\r\nspectral gondolier, rowed us silently along the labyrinthine canals of\r\nthis dim and ghostly Venice. Vathek Beckford would have made them\r\nwaterways to the Hall of Eblis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nIN THE AISNE--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n  LAON\r\n\r\nThe lively little city of Chauny, standing in the heart of the rich and\r\nlovely valley of the Oise, the 'golden vale' of this part of France, has\r\na history of its own of which I shall presently have something to say,\r\nand which throws some interesting light upon the general history of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBut Chauny owes its actual prosperity mainly to its connection with the\r\nCompany of St.-Gobain. From a very early period in the annals of the\r\ncompany, the plate-glass made at St.-Gobain was sent across the country\r\nto Chauny, and thence by water to Paris, where it was polished and\r\n'tinned' at the company's works in the Rue de Reuilly.\r\n\r\nWhen the first machines were invented for saving much of the manual\r\nlabour spent upon these processes, it occurred to the managers of the\r\ncompany that these machines might be advantageously worked with the\r\nwater-power of the Oise at Chauny. This was in the beginning of the\r\npresent century. About the same time, thanks to the foreign wars\r\nprovoked by the Girondists to promote the Revolution, it became very\r\ndifficult to obtain the supplies of natural soda necessary for the\r\nmanufacture of plate-glass, these supplies having been drawn, down to\r\nthat time, almost exclusively from Alicante in Spain; and the chemist\r\nLeblanc hit upon a process for extracting soda on a great scale from\r\nsea-salt. Of this invention the managers of St.-Gobain promptly availed\r\nthemselves; and, after a brief and unsatisfactory experiment at a place\r\ncalled Charlesfontaine, they established at Chauny some soda-works,\r\nwhich have since been developed into the most extensive chemical works\r\nin France.\r\n\r\nTaken in conjunction with the glassworks also now established here,\r\nthese works extend over an area of some thirty hectares, fourteen of\r\nwhich are occupied by buildings. Numerous canals fed from the Oise\r\ntraverse this immense area, some of them supplying water-power, others\r\nserving as waterways. The place, in short, is an industrial Amsterdam or\r\nRotterdam in miniature, lying between the river Oise, the Canal de\r\nSt.-Quentin, and the Canal de St.-Lazare. The Cité Ouvrière, built for\r\nthe workmen by the company, lies beyond the Canal de St.-Lazare and on\r\nthe road from Château Thierry in Champagne (the birthplace of La\r\nFontaine) to Béthune in Artois.\r\n\r\nThe streets and areas within the works are most appropriately baptized\r\nby the names of the eminent men of science to whom the company is\r\nindebted for great services either directly or indirectly: the Cour\r\nLavoisier, the Rue Pelouze, the Rue Guyton de Morvaux, the Rue Leblanc,\r\nthe Rue Gay-Lussac, the Cour Scheele, the Rue Hély d'Oisset.\r\n\r\nBesides the dwellings put up for the benefit of the workmen at Chauny,\r\nthe company has built here a chapel, established a free dispensary, and\r\norganised excellent schools for the children of both sexes, under the\r\nsupervision of the devoted Sisters, who have not yet been 'converted'\r\nout of Chauny.\r\n\r\n'What is the feeling of the people here on this question of clerical\r\nteaching?' I asked an acquaintance of mine, who formerly filled an\r\nimportant post in the local administration of this region, and who now\r\ndevotes himself to his flowers and his library in a charming old house\r\nof the eighteenth century, the high-walled courtyard of which is\r\ntapestried with luxuriant vines and creepers.\r\n\r\n'All the sensible people in Chauny,' he said--'and there are many\r\nsensible people in Chauny, though in the old times our neighbours used\r\nto speak of us as \"the monkies of Chauny\"--are quite disgusted with all\r\nthis newfangled nonsense, and with these incessant attacks on the\r\nclergy. The troublesome element here in Chauny is not to be found among\r\nthe workmen: it is to be found among the people who do not work. Of\r\ncourse, everybody knows that it is the great chemical and glass works\r\nhere which make Chauny prosperous. But for St.-Gobain we should be where\r\nwe were a hundred years ago. And so there is a tendency all through the\r\nDepartment to come to Chauny, in hopes of finding work under the\r\ncompany. Of course, in nine cases out of ten, those who seek it thus do\r\nnot get it, for it is the rule of the company always to give the\r\npreference to people from Chauny, or the immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n'Of course the unsuccessful \"immigrants\" linger about the place, and as\r\nthey don't find work they go lounging about the town, and take to drink\r\ntoo often and, in short, soon become the raw material of which in these\r\ndays the freemasons are making what they call \"Republicans.\" You have it\r\nall,' he added, 'in the letter which M. Allain-Targé has just written,\r\nrefusing to be a candidate this year for the Chambers.'\r\n\r\nI remembered very well the energy shown by M. Allain-Targé, as a\r\nRepublican Minister of the Interior, at the time of the elections of\r\nOctober 18, 1885. He then issued an official circular instructing all\r\nthe public functionaries that, while they were to be absolutely\r\n'neutral' as between Republican candidates of different colours, they\r\nmust exert themselves to the utmost as against all 'reactionary'\r\ncandidates. I was much interested, therefore, to learn the present\r\nopinion of M. Allain-Targé as to the outlook of the Republic under his\r\nsuccessor, M. Constans, in 1889. It was very instructive to find that M.\r\nAllain-Targé now declines to be a Republican candidate because, to use\r\nhis own words, though the High Court of Justice may 'deliver the\r\nRepublic from General Boulanger and his confederates, it is beyond the\r\npower of the High Court of Justice to bring France back--let us not say\r\nto the heroic age, but to the age of good faith, of disinterestedness,\r\nof common sense, and of that prudent, sincere, and loyal policy, thanks\r\nto which, during long years, France passed safely through so many\r\nserious trials.'\r\n\r\n'The new generations of electors,' says M. Allain-Targé in this\r\nremarkable letter, 'exact of their representatives conditions to which I\r\nwill not submit. I will not undertake to make the promises which it is\r\nnow the fashion of candidates to lavish, and which I cannot regard as\r\nserious.' These 'new generations of electors' are the 'new social\r\nstrata' about which Gambetta used to declaim so confidently only a few\r\nyears ago, and I quite agreed with my philosophic friend near Chauny in\r\nthinking that no slight significance must attach to such a verdict upon\r\nthem, pronounced in 1889 by an 'advanced Republican' like M.\r\nAllain-Targé, who only four years ago, in 1885, was the most active\r\nminister of a Government called into existence to carry out the ideas of\r\nGambetta, and to found a stable republic upon these 'new social strata.'\r\n\r\nPut into plain English, this letter of M. Allain-Targé, who had more\r\nthan any of his colleagues to do directly and in the way of business\r\nboth with the electors and with the elected of France four years ago,\r\nand who now declines to have anything more to do with them all--simply\r\nmeans that the electors sell their votes to the highest bidder, and that\r\nthe man who will make the most unscrupulous bid is likeliest to get the\r\nvotes. It is hard to see much difference between such a verdict and the\r\noutspoken declaration of M. Paul de Cassagnac that law, order, property,\r\nand liberty in France are threatened to-day, not by a 'democracy,' but\r\nby a 'voyoucratie' or 'blackguardocracy.'\r\n\r\nThe 'anti-clerical' agitation here, as elsewhere in France, I am\r\nassured, is plainly under the control of the 'freemasons.' Not that the\r\n'freemasons' are avowedly very numerous here. But they are influential\r\nbecause they act together, in silence, and on lines common to the\r\nagitation all over France. 'Three or four energetic members of the\r\norder,' said one very intelligent man to me here at Chauny, 'can easily\r\nmanage the whole official machinery of a large political district. To\r\nunderstand their methods and their organisation you must go back to the\r\nworship of Baphomet in the Middle Ages. In some of their lodges they\r\nreproduce with a goat one at least of the abominations which Von Hammer\r\ntells us were charged upon the Knights Templars as Baphometic. They are\r\na sect--a persecuting sect, and a sect bent on absolutely destroying the\r\nChristian religion. To this end they parody the Christian symbols and\r\nthe Christian scheme of charity and of good works. They do not, most of\r\nthem, hold office, it being much more to the purpose for them to awe the\r\nofficials, and that is their favourite way of working. There are,\r\nhowever, exceptions to this. If you go to Marmande in the South you will\r\nfind a sub-prefect there who is a most energetic and mischievous\r\n\"freemason.\" In the Aisne the Prefect is a freemason, and here all the\r\npublic functionaries go in fear of the order. They own the newspaper,\r\ncontrol profitable contracts of all sorts, and can make or mar the\r\ncareer of public servants, through their occult relations with people at\r\nheadquarters in Paris.'\r\n\r\nI suggested that in England and Germany and the United States the\r\n'freemasons' are not only regarded as friends of order and of law, but\r\nnumber among their dignitaries men of the highest official and personal\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n'That is quite true, no doubt,' he said. 'But this order in France has,\r\nI believe, no official relations now with the order in either of these\r\ncountries. Its affiliations are with the \"freemasons\" of Italy, of\r\nBelgium, and of Spain, so far as it has any affiliations. There have\r\nbeen \"freemasons,\" as you must know, among the Radical leaders in\r\nBelgium who have not hesitated, while holding high public positions, to\r\ndenounce Christianity in open meetings as a \"corpse blocking the way of\r\nmodern progress\"; and what the freemasonry of Italy and of Spain is I am\r\nsure you must know.'\r\n\r\nI told him that in Spanish America and in Brazil I had met priests who\r\nwere members of the order; and I particularly cited the case of an\r\necclesiastic of considerable importance, who in Costa Rica, some ten or\r\ntwelve years ago, was at the head of the Order of Freemasons in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n'That may be,' he replied, 'but officers of our expedition into Mexico\r\nunder Maximilian have told me that the freemasons in Mexico were active\r\nallies of the Liberals and of Juarez in their war against the Church.'\r\n\r\nThis I could not contradict, for while I never heard that President\r\nJuarez was himself a 'freemason,' I know, from my conversations with him\r\nafter the fall of the Empire, in 1871, that, though educated by the\r\npriests in Oajaca, as Robespierre was by the priests in Arras, he was an\r\nunbeliever of the type of the advanced Encyclopædists of the last\r\ncentury, and though not such a fanatic as Condorcet, strongly disposed,\r\nnot only to deprive the Mexican clergy of their 'fueros' under the old\r\nSpanish system, but to make an end of Catholicism in Mexico if possible.\r\nNor was he much more friendly to the Protestants, who were then trying,\r\nunder Bishop Riley, to found a Protestant propaganda in Mexico.\r\n\r\n'In France, at all events under the Third Republic,' he went on, 'the\r\n\"freemasons\" are the implacable enemies of religion. It was in full\r\naccord with them, and as a battle-cry in their interest, that Gambetta\r\nuttered his famous declaration that \"Clericalism is the enemy!\" And if\r\nthe \"freemasons\" of any other country recognise and in any fashion\r\naffiliate with the Grand Orient of France, they ought to understand what\r\nthey are doing, and to what objects they are lending themselves,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously. You tell me that General Washington was a\r\nfreemason. Yes, no doubt, but the freemasonry which he accepted was no\r\nmore like the modern \"freemasonry\" of France than this Third Republic of\r\nours is like the republic of which he was the founder!'\r\n\r\nThe processes carried on in the great chemical works at Chauny are in\r\ntheir way as interesting as the processes carried on at St.-Gobain or in\r\nthe glassworks here. But I cannot say they are as pleasant, or even as\r\npicturesque. Commercially speaking, the output of the chemical works of\r\nthis great company is at least as important now as the output of its\r\nglassworks. The chemical works grew up out of the necessities of the\r\nglassworks. When the company was led, at the beginning of this century,\r\nby the pressure of the war epoch, to adopt in its glassworks the use of\r\nthe artificial soda made by Leblanc, the Director soon found it\r\nadvisable to have the artificial soda manufactured by the company\r\nitself. This led to the establishment of the chemical works at Chauny,\r\nand down to 1867 the company itself was the chief consumer of these\r\nchemical products. The Exposition of that year widened the horizon, by\r\nmaking France acquainted with the agricultural importance of the English\r\nfabrication of 'superphosphates' as fertilisers. At the Exposition of\r\n1878 the Company of St.-Gobain exhibited, and received a gold medal, for\r\nsuperphosphates, which it was then turning out at the rate of 20,000\r\ntons a year from three establishments--one at Chauny, one at L'Oseraie,\r\nand one at Montluçon. As the company was then turning out a great\r\nproduction of sulphuric acid, and owned the only important mine of\r\npyrites in France, it went on with increasing energy, and now, in 1889,\r\nshows an output of 110,000 tons of superphosphates, from no fewer than\r\nsix establishments--Chauny, Aubervilliers, Marennes, Saint-Fons near\r\nLyon, L'Oseraie, and Montluçon. Besides these it possesses salt-works at\r\nArt-sur-Meurthe, its iron pyrites works at Sain-Bel, and some important\r\ndeposits of phosphates at Beauval. These give employment to no fewer\r\nthan 3,300 workmen, independently of those employed by the company at\r\nits various glassworks in the glass manufacture. At Chauny alone the\r\nchemical works employ 1,350 of these workmen. For these, as for its\r\nglassworkers, the company has established a system of savings\r\ninstitutions and of pensions. Medical advice and medicines are given\r\ngratuitously to the workmen and their families. The co-operative\r\nassociation founded by M. Cochin at St.-Gobain has not, I believe, been\r\nextended to the chemical works; but the company maintains\r\nestablishments which supply the chief wants of the workpeople at cost\r\nprice, and the dwellings provided for them, either gratuitously or at\r\nvery low rents, now number more than seven hundred, independently of the\r\ndormitories for unmarried workmen. Retiring pensions, varying from\r\none-fifth to one-fourth of the wages of the workmen, are granted to all\r\nafter a certain number of years of service, and to workmen disabled by\r\ndisease or by accidents.\r\n\r\nAt the pyrites-mine of Sain-Bel, in the South, near Tarare, where more\r\nthan 400 workmen are employed--300 as miners and the rest in the works\r\nabove named, the former earning on an average 1,309 fr. 25 c., and the\r\nlatter on an average 1,114 fr. 90 c. a year--a system exists under which\r\nany workman who chooses to put aside his savings in a _caisse de la\r\nvieillesse_ receives from the company, when he has completed twenty-five\r\nyears of service, or has attained the age of fifty-five years, an annual\r\npension more than equal to the amount at that time of his savings in the\r\n_caisse_.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the manufacture of chemical products is not so pleasant\r\nor so picturesque in itself as the manufacture of plate-glass and\r\nmirrors. Within the last decade the output of sulphuric acid alone from\r\nthe company's works has more than doubled, and now amounts to more than\r\n200,000 tons a year. The gases disengaged in the manufacture of chemical\r\nfertilisers, such as carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, fluorine of\r\nsilicium, and so on, it was found at Chauny, destroyed entirely in a\r\nvery short time the polish of the glass in the window-panes of the\r\nhouses opposite to the works, and certainly did not improve either the\r\nrespiratory organs or the general health of the workmen. The company\r\ntherefore spent a good deal of time and of money in working out a system\r\nfor the complete condensation of these gases. I am told that it has\r\nproved completely successful, and is now established in all the\r\nchemical works of the company, to the great advantage not only of the\r\nworkmen, but of the company also.\r\n\r\nAlthough Chauny is really a very ancient city--dating back at least to\r\nthe age of Charlemagne, when the monks of Cuissy and St.-Eloi-Fontaine,\r\nwith the keen eye of those early agriculturists for a good thing,\r\nreclaimed its marshes and turned them into a fat land, yielding, as an\r\nold local _dicton_ tells us, the\r\n\r\n                  'septem commoda vitæ,\r\n  Poma, nemus, segetes, linum, pecus, herba, racemus.'\r\n\r\n--it has almost nothing to show to-day in the way of antique\r\narchitecture. Of the 'seven comforts of life,' the vine has vanished\r\nalso; but all the others flourish abundantly, and the people of Chauny\r\nhave little to complain of on the score of the natural resources of\r\ntheir region. During the wars, though, of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, the place was so often taken and retaken that its buildings\r\nwere pretty well battered to pieces. The English of Harry the Fifth\r\nstormed it in 1417, and England held it for a quarter of a century,\r\nduring which period an incident occurred much more creditable to the\r\nburghers of Chauny than is the taking of the Bastille in 1789 to the\r\ncitizens of Paris. Monstrelet tells the story in a quaint and vigorous\r\nfashion. Chauny at that time was part of the appanage of the Duc\r\nd'Orléans, then a prisoner in England, and it was held for the\r\nconquerors by a French, nobleman, 'Messire Collard de Mailly,' who had\r\naccepted the office of Bailli of Vermandois from King Henry of England.\r\nThe burghers of Chauny, who had lived for two centuries in the enjoyment\r\nof the rights and privileges granted them in a royal charter by Philip\r\nAugustus, did not like this state of things at all. So they made up\r\ntheir minds to demolish the castle, lest 'Messire Collard de Mailly'\r\nshould fill it with English soldiers and make himself quite unendurable.\r\n\r\nIt was a rather hardy enterprise, and the burghers went about it with\r\ngreat coolness and good sense. Theirs was a real rising of the citizens\r\nof a town to abate a nuisance which threatened their liberties, and not,\r\nlike the attack on the Bastille, a blow struck at law, order, and the\r\nconstituted authorities of a great kingdom by a subsidised mob; and\r\ntheir leaders were the most respectable men of Chauny--not a crew of\r\nthieves and murderers like the infamous Maillard, that 'hero of the\r\nBastille,' against whom his own employers and allies were eventually\r\nforced to proceed as the chief of a gang of ruffians, and who, not\r\ncontent with assassinating political prisoners and stealing their\r\nproperty in Paris, roamed all over the Departments of the Seine and the\r\nSeine-et-Oise, torturing farmers to make them give up their money, and\r\nmaddening the countryside with outrages not to be described.\r\n\r\nJean and Mathieu de Longueval, Pierre Piat,[7] and other 'notable\r\npersons' of Chauny, bound themselves together by an oath, in 1432, to\r\n'take the fortress of the city and demolish it.' They chose an occasion\r\nwhen the bailli, Collard de Mailly, and his brother, Ferry de Mailly,\r\nwith some of their men, went riding out of the fortress 'to take their\r\npleasure in the town.'\r\n\r\n    [7] That 'Pierre Piat' was a man of character as well as of\r\n    substance appears from the fact that he was charged with seeing that\r\n    his wife, the cousin of a rich and charitable lady of Chauny, Marie\r\n    Martine de Feure, who died in 1400, should each year receive, under\r\n    the will of this good dame, 'a large piece of linen cloth whereof to\r\n    make shrouds for the poor who might die in the hospital of the\r\n    Hôtel-Dieu at Chauny.' Obviously there was much better stuff for the\r\n    making of a true republic among these good burghers of Chauny in the\r\n    fifteenth century than was to be\r\n\r\nfound among the shouting mobs of the Palais-Royal in the eighteenth.\r\n\r\nWith a few courageous 'companion adventurers,' previously posted in\r\nhiding near the castle, these determined burghers suddenly sallied\r\n'forth from the place where they were watching the castle gates, and, no\r\none paying any heed to them, entered the castle courtyard, drew up the\r\nbridge after them, and took possession.'\r\n\r\n'News of this going after the two brothers, they were sore displeased,\r\nbut they could do nothing,' says the chronicler; 'for the citizens who\r\nwere in the plot straightway fell to sounding the tocsin, and gathering\r\nabout the castle in great numbers, with arms and with sticks, were soon\r\nadmitted into it.'\r\n\r\nThe castle being thus secured, 'sundry notables of the city went to meet\r\nthe two knights, and assured them that no harm should come to them or\r\ntheirs, for that what had been done was done only for the peace and\r\nprosperity of the city.' Quite different this from the cowardly murder\r\nof the Governor of the Bastille, struck down after his surrender by some\r\nof Maillard's confederates, while that scoundrel himself still had his\r\nhand upon the unfortunate De Launay's collar.\r\n\r\nThe 'Messires de Mailly' made the best of a bad business, and, with all\r\ntheir friends and followers, withdrew into an hotel in the town. There\r\nall their property was brought from the castle and delivered to them,\r\nwhich, having been done, the good people of Chauny 'with one accord fell\r\nto work to slight and demolish the said fortress, and this with such\r\ngood-will that in a few days' time it was wholly razed and destroyed\r\nfrom top to bottom.'\r\n\r\nThe bailli and his brother soon departed out of the place, and 'Messires\r\nHector de Flavy and Waleran de Moreul,' who were sent to govern it by\r\nthe Comte de Luxembourg, 'found the citizens much more stiff and\r\ndisobedient than they had ever been before the desolation of the\r\naforesaid castle!'\r\n\r\nAfter Joan of Arc had driven the English out of the realm, Charles VII.\r\nhad the good sense to pardon the citizens of Chauny for destroying the\r\ncastle, and it was never rebuilt. The Spanish occupied Chauny after\r\ntheir victory of St.-Quentin in 1557. Five years afterwards Condé and\r\nhis Huguenots took the place, and did so much proselytising there that\r\nin 1589 Chauny was one of the first towns in France to recognise Henry\r\nof Navarre as King of France. It stood out for him when Laon and other\r\nimportant towns in this region had joined the League, and during his\r\nlong struggle with the House of Guise it was a central point about which\r\nthe hostile forces constantly manoeuvred. Henry himself came here\r\noften, and during the siege of La Fère 'La Belle Gabrielle' kept him\r\ncompany at Chauny, Sinceny, and Folembray.\r\n\r\nIn the next century the French and the Imperialists fought all around\r\nthe place, to the great disgust of the poor peasants, who hid themselves\r\nas eagerly in the woods from the troops of their own sovereign as from\r\nthose of his imperial enemy; and in 1652, Chauny, after a sharp but\r\nshort siege, surrendered to the Spaniards, who, however, agreed, by the\r\nterms of the capitulation, to 'maintain the burgesses in all their\r\ngoods, rights, privileges, charges, and offices.' The Mayor of Chauny,\r\nClaude le Coulteux, behaved so well in the siege, that Louis XIV.\r\nennobled him; and the curé of the church of St.-Martin, it is recorded,\r\nfought at the ramparts, and 'pointed the cannon with his own hand.'\r\n\r\nThis was the last deed of arms in the annals of this little city, though\r\nthe fortune of war has twice put Chauny under foreign rule. In 1814 the\r\nallies, and in 1870-71 the victorious Germans, occupied it, and laid it\r\nunder contribution.\r\n\r\nThat the Revolution of 1789 left the citizens of Chauny much less\r\ndetermined to do battle for their rights than their ancestors were in\r\nthe days of the English invaders, may be fairly inferred, I think, from\r\nthe very curious circumstance that, in 1815, they actually made a public\r\nsubscription for the purpose of presenting a very handsome gold medal,\r\nweighing two ounces, to the Prussian Commander of Chauny, Colonel Von\r\nBeulwitz.\r\n\r\nThis medal bore the inscription, in French, 'The grateful city of Chauny\r\nto M. Von Beulwitz, Commandant of Chauny.' The local authorities also\r\nasked, and obtained, for their Prussian satrap and his secretary the\r\ncross of the Legion of Honour!\r\n\r\nAll this was no doubt very creditable to the German authorities, and not\r\ndiscreditable to the good people of Chauny. But it certainly seems to\r\nshow that at the end of the Napoleonic era, the French people in the\r\nprovinces were thoroughly weary of the Revolution and all its\r\nconsequences. They welcomed peace at any price from any quarter. The\r\ntestimony of all impartial contemporary observers accords with the\r\ndeliberate opinion given by Gouverneur Morris to Alexander Hamilton in\r\n1796, that the French people in general were royalists at heart, and\r\nutterly averse to the general overthrow of their institutions by the\r\nlegislative mob at Paris, or, as Mirabeau comprehensively called them,\r\n'that Wild Ass of the National Assembly.'\r\n\r\nAt Chauny, in 1816, the inhabitants held a meeting under the presidency\r\nof the mayor, at which they declared, with great unanimity, that 'the\r\npeople of Chauny had never, in fact and of their own free will, adopted\r\nthe impious and seditious principles introduced in France by a factious\r\nminority, and that they regarded the death of the most Christian king,\r\nLouis XVI., as the most execrable of crimes.'\r\n\r\nChauny was a city then of less than 4,000 inhabitants, but the\r\nperipatetic 'patriots' of 1793 had contrived to do mischief enough, even\r\nin this small and quiet corner of France, to earn the detestation of its\r\npeople. They desecrated its churches, turning Notre-Dame into a\r\nsaltpetre factory, stealing the church bells to sell them, pulling down\r\nthe steeples and towers, and defacing the monuments.\r\n\r\nThey arrested and imprisoned numbers of the best citizens, broke up the\r\nancient hospitals, driving away the Sisters of Charity, and brought\r\nabout the murder, by the revolutionary tribunals, of a celebrated French\r\nadmiral, who co-operated in America with Rochambeau to secure the\r\nindependence of the United States--the Comte d'Estaing, who was well\r\nknown and very popular in Chauny.\r\n\r\nWhen the tribunal, after its fashion, called upon the fearless sailor\r\nfor his name, he replied, 'You know my name perfectly well,--it suits\r\nyou, perhaps, to pretend that you do not. But when you have cut off my\r\nhead, as you mean to do, send it to the English fleet, and they will\r\ntell you my name!'\r\n\r\nHere at Chauny, as elsewhere, the first concern of these revolutionary\r\n'friends of the people,' when they got possession of the machinery of\r\nthe State, was to confiscate the funds devoted by the piety and the\r\nbenevolence of past ages to the service of the people. The more closely\r\none looks into the social annals of France, the more amazing it is that\r\nthe world should so long have swallowed the monstrous misrepresentations\r\ncurrent in our century, as to the condition of the French people before\r\n1789, and especially as to the organisation, under the _ancien régime_,\r\nof public charity and of public education in France.\r\n\r\nChauny possessed, as far back as the beginning of the twelfth century,\r\na public hospital or Hôtel-Dieu, and a hospital for lepers called the\r\n'Maladrerie.' Who founded the Hôtel-Dieu is not known, for in those\r\n'ages of faith,' so lovingly described by Kenelm Digby, it was not\r\nthought so extraordinary a thing that a man or a woman should devote his\r\nor her substance to benevolent purposes, as it is fast coming to be in\r\nour own times.\r\n\r\nThe mayor and sworn magistrates of the city were the official governors\r\nof the hospital, and the chaplain was taken from among the monks of\r\nSaint-Eloi-Fontaine. A century and a half afterwards, in 1250, the Abbot\r\nof Saint-Eloi-Fontaine received, under the wills of three burghers of\r\nChauny, a sum equal to about 40,000 francs of our time for the service\r\nof the hospital of the Hôtel-Dieu. It is worth remembering that the\r\nThird French Republic has passed a law forbidding ecclesiastics to\r\nreceive or execute such benevolent trusts as this.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded in a note to a subsequent legacy made to this\r\ninstitution in the fifteenth century by a pious dame of Chauny. A few\r\nyears later, in 1419, Colart Le Miroirier, a resident of Chauny, left to\r\nthe Hôtel-Dieu all his lands and goods at Chauny, Ognes, and Roy.\r\n\r\nThe 'religious wars' wrecked the Hôtel-Dieu in the sixteenth century;\r\nbut in 1620 a devout woman, Marie Dubuisson, took the work of\r\nreconstruction in hand, and the citizens followed it up; so that, by the\r\nend of the seventeenth century, it was well in order once more, and it\r\ncontinued to be administered for the benefit of the poor of Chauny till\r\nthe 'patriots' confiscated it in 1793.\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire, in 1811, the re-established hospital was combined with\r\nan orphan asylum, and both were put under the charge of the Sisters of\r\nCharity, one of whom, Sister Renée Canet, had the good sense to found\r\nhere a little manufactory of hosiery and caps, which holds its own, I am\r\ntold, despite the not very benevolent combinations against it of the\r\nlocal hosiers. The old buildings of the Hôtel-Dieu, however, no longer\r\nexist, and the chief public hospital of Chauny is installed in a large\r\nedifice put up under the Second Empire in 1865, and known as the\r\n'Hospice-Sainte-Eugénie,' in honour of the Empress. It says something\r\nfor the common sense of the local authorities that they have not\r\ninsisted on changing the name of the institution.\r\n\r\nDuring the orgies of 1793 the paintpot was busy with all the streets and\r\nplaces of Chauny. The Rue de Prémontré, so called because some property\r\nthere belonging to the famous abbey of the Præmonstratensians, became\r\nthe _cul-de-sac_ or 'bag-bottom of Fraternity;' the Rue des Moinets took\r\nthe name of Jean-Jacques Rousseau; while the Rue Ganton, the licensed\r\nabode of the social evil of Chauny, received, with exquisite tact and\r\npropriety, the name of the Roman hero Scævola! The monastery of the Holy\r\nCross, founded by Mary of Clèves, Duchesse d'Orléans, about the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century, was confiscated, and made the headquarters of the\r\nRepublican Commission, the street on which it stood receiving the name\r\nof the 'Bag-bottom of Vigilance,' from the banner which was borne upon\r\npublic occasions through the streets by this commission, on which was\r\ndepicted 'the Eye of Vigilance, a symbol of that exercised by it over\r\nthe enemies of the Republic and the people.'\r\n\r\nAnother street in Chauny, the Rue des Bons Enfans, preserves the memory\r\nof the early foundation in the little city of public schools for the\r\nchildren of the poor--'les bons enfans escholiers.'\r\n\r\nWhere now stands the communal school of Chauny stood, I am told, a\r\npublic college, founded here in the earliest years of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The buildings of this college were restored under the Regency\r\nand Louis XV. They were confiscated, and the establishment swept away by\r\nthe worthy Revolutionists of 1793, at the same time that they gave a\r\npublic ball in the Church of Notre-Dame in honour of the Tree of\r\nLiberty, which the young girls of the place were expected to attend 'in\r\ndresses of white, symbolic of their innocence, and adorned only with\r\ntheir virtues!'\r\n\r\nBesides this public college, Chauny, before the beneficent epoch of the\r\nRevolution, possessed a public school in each parish of the town. The\r\nschoolmaster, besides his regular scholars, who paid for their\r\neducation, was expected to receive and educate eight poor children\r\nnominated by the mayor and sworn magistrates. For this he received,\r\nunder Louis XIV., in 1706, forty setiers of wheat and fifty livres in\r\nmoney. It is interesting, also, to learn that the principal of the\r\npublic college, when he happened to be a layman, received a salary,\r\nunder Louis XIV., of 400 livres in addition to his dwelling-house. When\r\nhe was a priest he received only 300 livres, but he might also receive\r\n172 livres more as chaplain of the Hôtel-Dieu. The well-to-do citizens\r\nwho sent their children to the college paid for each child forty sols a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhen law and order had been re-established by Napoleon in France, two\r\ncitizens of Chauny, Carra and Dumoulin, in December 1802, got permission\r\nto re-open the college, which the Revolution had closed. It has never\r\nrecovered its former importance however, and Chauny now possesses only a\r\ncommunal school, I am told, and two religious or free schools, besides\r\nthe establishments maintained by the Company of St.-Gobain. One\r\neducational foundation of the _ancien régime_, however, still survives,\r\nin the bursaries of the Abbé Bouzier.\r\n\r\nAntoine Bouzier d'Estouilly, priest, abbot of Notre-Dame-lès-Ardres,\r\ndoctor in science, doctor of the Sorbonne, canon and écolâtre of the\r\ncollégiale of St.-Quentin, was a noble as well as a priest. He founded,\r\non October 10, 1713, a fund for endowing two poor boys with the funds\r\nnecessary to enable them, in his own words, 'to serve the Church as\r\necclesiastics, or the public in civil functions.' This phraseology is\r\nworth noting by people who are tempted to believe the nonsense current\r\nin our day to the effect that 'almost everything we know as modern\r\ncivilisation in connection with institutions of a philanthropic sort has\r\ntaken shape within the last hundred years, and is due to the influence\r\nof the Revolution of 1789 in France.'\r\n\r\nNothing can be wider of the truth than this. On the contrary, the\r\nprogress of modern civilisation in connection with such institutions was\r\ndistinctly checked and thwarted for a time in France by the shock of\r\nthis Revolution, and in other countries by the horror and indignation\r\nwhich the follies and crimes of the French Revolutionists excited.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Abbé Bouzier was expressly intended by him to\r\nbenefit 'the poorest' of those who should compete for its advantages,\r\nregard being had to their natural ability and aptitudes for study. Each\r\nbeneficiary was to enjoy his scholarship for eight consecutive years,\r\ndating from his entrance into the third class. If he had got beyond the\r\nthird class when he secured his nomination the difference was to run\r\nagainst him. For example, a scholar ready to enter the class of rhetoric\r\nwho received a nomination was to hold his scholarship for six years\r\nonly; if he was ready to enter upon the study of theology, law or\r\nmedicine, for three years only; after the expiration of which another\r\nmust be appointed to enjoy it. Provisions were also made to secure the\r\ngood conduct of the beneficiaries. How this excellent foundation escaped\r\nthe cupidity of the Revolutionists is not clear.\r\n\r\nFrom June, 1793, to March, 1795, the _Société Populaire_ of Chauny,\r\norganised by emissaries from Paris, ruled the town absolutely. The\r\nofficial authorities of the city and of the district went in abject\r\nterror of them; for a denunciation sent to the headquarters in Paris by\r\nthis society was like a report sent thither from an army in the field by\r\none of the legislative spies who accompanied the generals of the\r\nRepublic, and swaggered about in the camps wearing the mountebank\r\ncostumes which may be studied with amusement and advantage in the museum\r\nof the Revolution established this year in the Pavillon de Flore at\r\nParis. The members of this _Société Populaire_ openly pillaged the\r\nchurches and convents, made domiciliary visits, sold certificates of\r\n'civism,' and dictated the most extraordinary measures of confiscation\r\nand outrage. Their loudest leader was a certain Pierre Gogois, who used\r\nto wind up their meeting by singing songs of his own composition,\r\naddressed to the 'crowned brigands who were trying to re-establish the\r\nabominable monarchy with the help of their anthropophagous hordes!'\r\nThese worthies abolished the school kept by the 'Daughters of the\r\nCross,' confiscated their property, and set up their own headquarters in\r\nthe convent.\r\n\r\nIn some way the Bouzier fund escaped their clutches, and it has been so\r\nwell managed that in 1871 the income was found large enough to warrant\r\nthe managers in establishing three scholarships instead of two.\r\n\r\nThe good example of the Abbé has been followed in our own times by a\r\nChristian lady, Madame Lacroix of Sinceny. In memory of her son, a\r\nCouncillor-General of the Aisne, who was universally esteemed throughout\r\nthe department, and who died at the early age of thirty-five, this lady\r\nfounded, a few years ago in perpetuity, eight prizes, to be annually\r\ncompeted for by the pupils of all the communal schools of the canton of\r\nChauny, and by the pupils of the schools established here by the Company\r\nof St.-Gobain, as well as four full scholarships at the School of Arts\r\nand Industries in Châlons-sur-Marne.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are to be competed for in applied geometry, in linear and\r\nornamental drawing, as well as in all the obligatory studies of the\r\nschools concerned. The competitors for the four Châlons scholarships\r\nmust be the sons of workmen, domestic servants, labourers, or persons\r\nemployed in agriculture or in manufactures within the canton of Chauny,\r\nwhose incomes or earnings do not amount to 2,000 francs a year.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the Municipal Council of Chauny founded six purses of 450 francs\r\na year, each to be competed for by candidates wishing to fit themselves\r\nto compete for the Lacroix scholarships, the successful candidates being\r\nleft at liberty to enter any one of the free schools in Chauny. As\r\nMadame Lacroix has made the curates of the churches of Notre-Dame and\r\nSt.-Martin _ex-officio_ members of the council of her fund, it is to be\r\npresumed that the Government at Paris will find some way of striking\r\nthese clergymen out of the list, as it has already struck all ministers\r\nof religion out of the local committees of supervision in educational\r\nmatters throughout France, for a French Republic is nothing if not\r\nlogical.\r\n\r\nMy likening of Chauny to a French Rotterdam or Amsterdam may be excused\r\nwhen I say that in the middle of the last century the Mayor of Chauny\r\nassured the Intendant of Soissons that the municipality had to keep up\r\nno fewer than twenty-seven bridges. What with the Oise and its\r\naffluents, and the many watercourses created about the place, either\r\nto drain the marsh lands or to facilitate navigation, Chauny really is\r\nan aquatic little capital like Annecy in Savoy. Naturally its citizens\r\nset a certain value on their fishing rights, and it may edify those who\r\nobstinately insist on regarding the feudal ages as ages of brute force,\r\nto know that so early as in 1175 the citizens of Chauny, by the\r\nlieutenant of the bailliage, Messire Regnault Doucet, asserted and\r\nsuccessfully maintained before the royal representatives their right to\r\nfish in all the waters round about their town in all lawful ways against\r\nthe pretensions of no less a personage than the Duchesse d'Orléans. In\r\n1540 this right was confirmed to them anew, and it was then shown that\r\nat an inquest held in 1475 the witnesses had testified that from time\r\nwhereof the memory of man ran not to the contrary no citizen of Chauny\r\nhad ever been molested in the exercise of his right to fish in the\r\nwaters of Chauny either on behalf of the Duc d'Orléans or on behalf of\r\nthe King. The local archives, which are singularly rich and\r\nwell-preserved, are full of instances like this, which show that the\r\ngeneral current of life in this corner of France, long before the\r\nRevolution, was determined neither by the caprices of the great, nor by\r\nthe passions of the mob, but by systematic considerations of law and of\r\ntradition, until for the confusion of France, and more or less of the\r\ncivilised world, the natural evolution and development of law and order\r\nwere suddenly and insanely interrupted through the inconceivable\r\nweakness of a most amiable and useless king, by the 'wild asses' of\r\nMirabeau, acting in 1789 under the pressure of what so friendly an\r\neyewitness of their conduct as Gouverneur Morris calls the 'abominable'\r\npopulace of Paris.\r\n\r\nSo complete was the civilisation of this region long before the\r\nRevolution of 1789, that the mayor, the magistrates, and the citizens of\r\nChauny, early in the seventeenth century, succeeded in breaking down and\r\nruining an Italian gentleman, Cesare de Rusticis, who, thanks to\r\nConcini, had secured a royal patent for canalising the Oise from La Fère\r\nto Chauny. They got a notable advocate, M. Louis Vrevin, to draw up a\r\nprotest against the enterprise in the most florid and elaborate fashion\r\nof the _Plaideurs_ of Racine, and by dint of bombarding the King's\r\nCouncil with the names of Julius Cæsar, Pompey, Xerxes, Sesostris,\r\nCleopatra, Cicero, Tertullian, and others, got, in 1625, what we in\r\nAmerica now call an 'injunction,' putting a stop to the works begun by\r\nthis foreigner, who 'had come into France to fix the eye of curiosity\r\nupon the river Oyse and to disturb it.' And a century later I find an\r\noperation carried out here for converting a not very satisfactory\r\nprivate investment into cash at the expense of the State which really\r\nwould not discredit the most ingenious American 'railway king' of our\r\nown times. This also concerned a canal, the canal which unites the Oise\r\nwith the Somme. This waterway became the property in 1728 of a\r\ncelebrated millionaire of that time, Antoine de Crozat, and after his\r\ndeath fell, in the division of his estates, to the share of his\r\ngranddaughter, the Duchesse de Choiseul. It was not very profitable, and\r\nit represented a capital which ought to have yielded 2,200,000 livres a\r\nyear. So a certain M. Laurent, who had built for the Duc de Choiseul his\r\nmagnificent Château de Chanteloup, near Amboise (pulled down fifty years\r\nago by Chaptal, the first great producer of beetroot sugar in France),\r\nundertook to get the canal turned into money. The plate-glass works of\r\nSt.-Gobain were then under the direction of M. Deslandes, the clever\r\nnominee of Mme. Geoffrin. M. Laurent tried to persuade M. Deslandes to\r\nemploy Picard coal (which could be brought by the canal) instead of wood\r\nin the furnaces at St.-Gobain. M. Deslandes made the experiment, but\r\nsoon gave it up, as the coal smoke injured the plate-glass. He\r\nconsented, however, to take four boatloads of the Picard coal and use it\r\nin the forges connected with the works. This was enough for M. Laurent,\r\nwho went to Paris with an invoice of the four boatloads of coal, laid it\r\nbefore the Council with an elaborate paper setting forth the value to\r\nthe canal of a traffic necessary to carry on the manufacture of the\r\nfamous plate glass at St.-Gobain, and got the Council finally to\r\npurchase the Duchesse's canal on his own terms. I really do not see what\r\nM. Laurent had to learn either from the 'Contrat Social' of Rousseau or\r\neven from the American Declaration of Independence! If he had lived now\r\nhe would have been a sharp competitor with a countryman of mine, of whom\r\nI am told in Chauny that he came here only a few years ago, inspected\r\nthe chemical works, looked into the composition of certain heaps of\r\nrubbish thrown aside even by the sagacious managers of these works, and\r\nsetting up near one of the canals a genuine wooden American shed, so\r\napplied to what he found in this rubbish certain processes for the\r\nvulcanisation of indiarubber as to produce at very low cost certain\r\narticles for which a great and increasing demand exists, and thus\r\nfounded a considerable industry here. He has since turned his\r\nestablishment over, I am told, to a company at a great profit to\r\nhimself, and gone back 'to the Rocky Mountains.' I am sorry for this,\r\nfor I should have been glad to 'interview' him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIN THE AISNE--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n  LAON\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find in France, or out of France, on a pleasant\r\nsummer's day, a more charming drive than the highway which leads from\r\nChauny, with its great modern industries and its lively, bustling\r\npeople, to the little feudal town of Coucy-le-Château, perched upon its\r\nlofty hill and dominated by one of the grandest, if not, indeed, the\r\ngrandest, of feudal fortress-homes.\r\n\r\nI do not know that Gargantua would now find the people of Chauny as\r\nentertaining as Rabelais tells us they were in his time. Then he 'amused\r\nhimself much with the boatmen, and above all with those of Chauny in\r\nPicardy--wonderful chatterboxes, and great at bandying chaff on the\r\nsubject of green monkeys.' There is no lack of boatmen now at Chauny,\r\nthough the railway has taken away much of their living; but the glory of\r\nthe green monkeys, I fear, has departed. In the days of Gargantua, the\r\nChaunois were as famous as the Savoyards now are, for wandering over\r\nFrance with trained monkeys and trained dogs. On October 1 in each year,\r\non the feast of St. Rémy, every one of these peripatetic citizens was\r\nexpected to appear in his native town, there to join in a procession\r\nwhich marched from what is now known as the Port Royal to the Bailliage,\r\nbearing to the lieutenant-general of the king a traditional present in\r\nthe form of a huge pasty, decorated with eggs and chestnuts, and\r\nsurmounted by a pastry tower.\r\n\r\nTo the confection of this pasty the famous mills of Chauny, reputed the\r\nbest in France, were bound to contribute five _setiers_ of wheat, and\r\nthe guild of the butchers a calf's head.\r\n\r\nBefore the procession marched a learned dog, trained to all manner of\r\ntricks and devices, and upon either side of the dog the town trumpeters,\r\nsounding their finest and loudest _fanfares_.\r\n\r\nAt the Bailliage the lieutenant-general received the procession, seated\r\nin a great chair of state in the midst of the hall, with wide open\r\ndoors, that all the people crowding into the Place might see what went\r\non within. Before this high functionary the learned dog advanced, quite\r\nalone, and performed all his best tricks. He then gave way to the bearer\r\nof the pasty. This having been gravely accepted, after the manner of a\r\nfeudal homage, by the lieutenant-general, the bearer, passing it on to\r\nthe servants of the Bailliage, proceeded himself to imitate as exactly\r\nand as skilfully as possible all the performances of his predecessor the\r\nlearned dog, amid the shouting and applause of the multitude.\r\n\r\nThis over, a great silence fell upon the whole assembly, and it then\r\nbecame the duty of the performer, assuming an attitude of profound and\r\ndeferential obeisance, to salute the lieutenant-general after a fashion\r\nmore easily describable by Rabelais or by M. Armand Silvestre than by\r\nme, and which seems to have been derived from some of the singular rites\r\nattributed by Von Hammer to the Templars, as a part of the ceremonial\r\nobserved by them in their secret conclaves.\r\n\r\nWhen all this had been duly gone through with, the 'jongleurs' of Chauny\r\nreceived the Royal permission to resume their perambulations of the\r\nrealm for another year, and the day wound up with junketings and\r\njollifications all over the town.\r\n\r\nThe 'jongleurs' and the learned dogs and the green monkeys have passed\r\naway, with the lieutenant-general of the king. But I found a certain\r\nhomely shrewdness and vivacity in the people with whom I talked as they\r\nwent in and out of the '_Pot d'Etain_,' the chief hostelry of the place,\r\nand the fact that this chief hostelry still keeps its good old-time name\r\nof the 'Tin Pot,' and has not changed itself into a 'Grand Hôtel de\r\nChauny,' seemed to me to argue a survival here of common sense and sound\r\nlocal feeling. The host of the 'Tin Pot,' a solid, well-to-do personage,\r\nlearned in crops and horses, gave me a capital trap, shaded with an\r\nawning such as is worn on the delightful little basket-waggons at Nice\r\nand Monte-Carlo, and a wide-awake driver for my trip to Coucy and Anizy,\r\non the way to Laon. His daughter, a decidedly good-looking young lady,\r\nnot wholly unconscious of her natural advantages, who kept the guests of\r\nthe café in capital order, seemed to have no high opinion of the powers\r\nthat be in France. She took up an English sovereign which I laid down on\r\nthe counter when settling a bill, and looked at it with much interest.\r\n'That weighs more than a napoleon,' she said; 'and who is the young\r\nlady? She is pretty, and it is a good head.'\r\n\r\nI explained that the lady was young because the coin was old, and that\r\nthe head was the head of the Queen of Great Britain, who had reigned\r\nover that realm for more than fifty years.\r\n\r\n'More than fifty years!' exclaimed the damsel; 'is it possible! And\r\nstill the same queen! Ah! they are well behaved the English; no wonder\r\nthey are rich. They are not such babies as we are!'\r\n\r\nAfter passing through the well-built and neatly kept _cités ouvrières_\r\nof the Chauny branch of the Company of St.-Gobain, and the little suburb\r\nof Autreville, the highway to Coucy-le-Château, and to the once royal\r\ncity of Soissons, runs through such fine woodlands, alternating with\r\nparks and highly-cultivated fields, that one seems to be traversing a\r\ngreat private domain. The trees are as well-grown as any you see in\r\nEngland; the hedges are luxuriant, the roadway is admirably made and\r\nperfectly well kept. The Comte de Brigode has a handsome château here,\r\nstanding well in a large park; and there is a good deal of hunting and\r\nshooting here in the season.\r\n\r\nNear by, too, is the pleasant château of Lavanture, long the home of a\r\nbranch established here of the once famous Dauphinese family of De\r\nThéis. It was brought here from the land of Bayard and of De Comines by\r\na stalwart soldier, one of the lansquenet officers of Francis I., but\r\nits renown in Picardy is of a gentler and more humane type; and after\r\ngiving a long succession of kindly and learned men to the public service\r\nthrough the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it finally died out\r\nwith Constance de Théis, Princesse de Salm, who was known under the\r\nDirectory and the Empire in Paris as the 'Muse of Reason,' and the\r\n'Boileau of Women,' and with her nephew, the last Baron de Théis, one of\r\nthe most charming of men, and one of the most conscientious and accurate\r\nof archæologists and collectors. The baron died in 1874. The 'objets\r\nd'art et de haute curiosité,' brought together by him with infinite\r\npains and unerring taste into his château of Lavanture, were dispersed\r\nunder the hammer of the auctioneer, and Lavanture itself passed into the\r\npossession of another race.\r\n\r\nThis whole region of the Laonnais and the Soissonnais is full of\r\nhistoric souvenirs. It may be almost called the cradle of the French\r\nmonarchy. Its reasonably well authenticated annals go back to the Roman\r\ndomination. Its mediæval monasteries were among the richest; its\r\nmediæval monks among the most learned and industrious and useful of\r\nFrance, draining the marsh-lands, reclaiming the wastes, clearing the\r\nforests. Its feudal barons were typical men of their order, alike in\r\ntheir virtues and in their vices. The seigneurs of Lizy and of Mareilly,\r\nof Esternay and of Roncy, of Mauny and Trucy, come and go through the\r\narchives of the towns and communes here, now defying the kings of France\r\nand trampling on the peasants, now standing by the peasants and still\r\ndefying the kings; quarrelling with and plundering the Church to-day,\r\ndoing penance to-morrow, and endowing chapels and convents. You\r\ncontinually come amid the smiling farms and fertile acres upon some\r\nshattered hold whose towers once rose above the hamlet and the church.\r\n\r\nA region such as this in England would be rich, not in historic ruins\r\nand historic recollections alone, but in ancient strongholds of feudal\r\npower converted gradually, through the gradual progress of a strong and\r\nsteadfast race, into stately modern homes. It would have its Warwick\r\nCastle and its Charlecote, its Guy's Cliff and its Stoneleigh, as well\r\nas its Kenilworth.\r\n\r\nBut in the great houses and the châteaux, of which there is no lack in\r\nthe Laonnais and the Soissonnais, there is little now that is historic,\r\nsave their names and their sites. They are standing witnesses to the\r\nessentially criminal and senseless character of the Revolution of 1789.\r\nThe _Jacqueries_ which Arthur Young found raging all over France during\r\nthat year of ill omen were not much less brutal and they were much more\r\ninexcusable than the _Jacqueries_ of 1357 for which the Comte de Foix\r\nand the Captal de Buch exacted the stern vengeance chronicled by\r\nFroissart. They were the cause and not the consequence of that\r\nemigration of the landed classes which contributed so much to the\r\ndownfall of law and order in France.\r\n\r\nThey were one of the justifying causes, not one of the excusable\r\nconsequences, of the armed coalitions of the Continent against\r\nRevolutionary France. Pétion and the other scoundrels in Paris who\r\nstirred them up were doubtless 'political' criminals, to adopt a\r\ndistinction without a difference much in favour in our times. But the\r\npeasants who took an active part in these crimes were simply brigands\r\nand assassins. They murdered men, they tortured women and children, they\r\npillaged houses, while the King of France and Navarre was assembling the\r\nStates-General to reform the abuses of the government. France was at\r\npeace with all the world. It was the fashion at Versailles and in the\r\ndrawing-rooms of Paris to fall into spasms of sentimental emotion over\r\nperiwinkles and over peasants--to rave about the instinctive nobility of\r\nhuman nature and the inherent Rights of Man. Never was any country in\r\nthe world in less danger of being trampled under foot by 'tyrants and\r\noppressors' than was France in 1789, when of a sudden, all over the\r\nkingdom, the peasants, who were about to be liberated and crowned with\r\nflowers, rose like wolves upon the landholders who were to liberate and\r\nto crown them--burst by night into defenceless châteaux, dragged tender\r\nwomen and young children out of their beds, and drove them out into the\r\nworld penniless and to starve, demolished all the valuables they could\r\nnot carry away, wrecked the buildings, burned the pictures, the works of\r\nart, and the libraries.\r\n\r\nThe 'Terror' of 1793 at Paris was black and vile enough. But the Terror\r\nof 1789 in the provinces was blacker and more vile. Arthur Young met on\r\nthe highway seigneurs flying from their homes half-naked, with their\r\nfamilies, in the vain hope of finding shelter in the nearest town. At\r\nMontcuq, in what is now the Department of the Lot, the peasants broke\r\ninto the château of the Marquise de Fondani, and carried off all the\r\ngrain, all the beds, a hundred and twenty sheets, forty-two dozen\r\ntowels, fifty-four tablecloths, two hundred and forty chemises, eleven\r\nsilk dresses, twelve dresses of Indian muslin, thirty-two pairs of silk\r\nstockings, five fine Aubusson tapestries. The plundered mistress of the\r\nhouse was driven out, to live on the charity of her friends. Her aunt,\r\naged ninety-four years, was thrown upon a dunghill, where she died\r\ngazing on the peasants whom she had cared for and treated with kindness\r\nfor years, as they divided among themselves her house-linen, her\r\nfurniture, her plate, her porcelains, the very doors and windows of her\r\nhome. All this was in the summer of 1789, long before a German trumpet\r\nsounded to arms on the French frontier. And all this went on throughout\r\nthe glorious year 1789 all over France. At Mamers, on the Dive, in\r\nBrittany, in July 1789, while the Gardes-Françaises were dishonouring\r\nthe uniform they wore and disgracing the name of France by joining in\r\nthe cowardly attack of a howling mob on the Bastille, and protecting the\r\nruffians who butchered the unfortunate De Launay, the estimable peasants\r\nof that place seized two ladies, Madame de Barneval and Madame des\r\nMalets, and beat their teeth to pieces with stones like so many Comanche\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nThe people of the city of Le Mans at the same time beat to death M. de\r\nGuilly, burned alive the aged Comte de Falconnière, broke into the\r\nChâteau de Juigné, cut off the ears and the noses of all the persons\r\nthey found there, and drove them out with pitchforks, following and\r\nstriking them till they died. In Provence similar horrors were committed\r\nat the same time, under the direct instigation of the local authorities,\r\ncalled there the consuls.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1789, M. de Barras was cut in pieces before the eyes of his\r\nwife. Madame de Listenay and her two daughters were tied naked to trees\r\nand tormented. Madame de Monteau and all the inmates of her house were\r\ntormented for eight hours and then drowned in the lake in her own\r\ngrounds. At Castelnau de Montmirail, near Cahors, the head of one of two\r\nbrothers, De Ballud, was cut off and the blood left to drip upon the\r\nface of the surviving brother; the Comtesse de la Mire was seized in her\r\nown house by the peasants and her arms cut to pieces; M. Guillin was\r\nslain, roasted, and eaten before the eyes of his wife. At Bordeaux the\r\nAbbés de Longovian and Dupuy were beheaded and their heads carried about\r\non pikes. M. de Bar was burned alive in his château. All these horrors,\r\nand innumerable others not less revolting, were committed all over\r\nFrance in cold blood, before the advance of the 'standard of the\r\ntyrants' had set M. Rouget de l'Isle to composing the declamatory\r\nrigmarole of the _Marseillaise_. Is it possible to regard a revolution\r\nwhich began in this hideous, cowardly, and burglarious fashion with any\r\nfeelings other than those inspired by the Gordon riots of 1780 in\r\nLondon? If the truth in regard to these things could have been known in\r\nAmerica in 1789, as it may now be learned from the unanswerable\r\ntestimony of authentic contemporary documents in France, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that Washington would have treated anyone who begged him to\r\naccept a key of the Bastille as he would have treated Dickens's Hugh or\r\nDennis tendering to him a key of Newgate prison, with the compliments\r\nof Lord George Gordon.\r\n\r\nFrom the private conversation and correspondence of the few Americans\r\nthen in Europe who really knew what was going on in France, the most\r\nthoughtful and alert of our public men gathered enough of the truth to\r\nregard the first French Republic with loathing and contempt. Their\r\ngeneral feeling on the subject is expressed in an entry in his diary\r\nmade during the month of October, 1789, long before 'the Terror,' by\r\nGouverneur Morris. 'Surely it is not the usual order of Divine\r\nProvidence to leave such abominations unpunished. Paris is, perhaps, as\r\nwicked a spot as exists. Incest, murder, bestiality, fraud, rapine,\r\noppression, baseness, cruelty, and yet this is the city which has\r\nstepped forward in the sacred cause of Liberty!'\r\n\r\nThis picture of Paris in 1789 is the more impressive that it was not\r\ndrawn by a Puritan or a Pharisee. Gouverneur Morris was eminently what\r\nis called a 'man of the world,' His diary abounds in proofs that, to use\r\nhis own language, he was 'no enemy to the tender passion.' Indeed, while\r\nthe elections for the States-General were going on, he appears to have\r\nbeen almost as much interested in finding out the fair author of an\r\nanonymous billet-doux as in unravelling the politics of the day. He was\r\nnot so much scandalised by the immorality as appalled by the lawlessness\r\nof the French capital. He foresaw the failure of the Revolution from the\r\noutset. A week before the States-General met in April, 1789, he wrote to\r\nGeneral Washington: 'One fatal principle pervades all ranks. It is a\r\nperfect indifference to the violation of all engagements.'\r\n\r\nHe noted at the same time the fears of Necker lest it should be 'found\r\nimpossible to trust the troops.'\r\n\r\nOf the Tiers-Etat, when it had carried into effect the grotesque and\r\nsenseless dictum, of the Abbé Sieyès, that the Tiers-Etat, having\r\nthitherto been nothing in France, ought thenceforth to be everything,\r\nMorris expected only what came of it under its self-assumed title of a\r\n'National Assembly.' 'It is impossible,' he wrote to Robert Morris in\r\nAmerica, 'to imagine a more disorderly body. They neither reason,\r\nexamine, nor discuss. They clap those whom they approve, and hiss those\r\nwhom they disapprove.... I told their President frankly that it was\r\nimpossible for such a mob to govern the country. They have unhinged\r\neverything. It is anarchy beyond conception, _and they will be obliged\r\nto take back their chains_.'\r\n\r\nAll this was long before 'the Terror,' I repeat. It was long before 'the\r\nTerror' that the hotel of the Duc de Castries was stormed and pillaged\r\nin Paris by a mob because the son of the Duc, having been grossly\r\ninsulted by a popular favourite, De Lameth, had called Lameth out,\r\nallowed Lameth's seconds to choose swords as the weapons, and then\r\nwounded Lameth. This monstrous performance the Assembly sanctioned.\r\n\r\n'I think,' wrote Morris very quietly, 'it will lead to consequences not\r\nnow dreamt of.'\r\n\r\nIn this same year, 1789, long before 'the Terror,' Morris, noting in his\r\ndiary a conversation with General Dalrymple, a kinsman of the rather\r\ncelebrated Madame Elliot, observes, 'he tells me of certain horrors\r\ncommitted in Arras, but to these things we are familiarised.'\r\n\r\nIt was this essentially criminal and anarchical character of the\r\nRevolution of 1789 which brought on 'the Terror,' not 'the Terror' which\r\nengendered the crime and the anarchy.\r\n\r\nWhy should 'horrors' have been committed at Arras in 1789? The\r\ncontemporary documents show that the people in and about Arras were much\r\nbetter off in 1789 than they had ever before been. The renting value of\r\nfarms about Arras was nearly or quite thirty per cent. higher in 1750\r\nthan it had been in 1700, and it was nearly or quite 100 per cent.\r\nhigher in 1800 than in 1750. M. de Calonne cites a farm which had\r\nbrought only 1,800 livres in 1714 as bringing, in 1784, 3,800 livres.\r\nMen paid these advanced prices not for the ownership of the land, which\r\nbefore 1789 carried with it certain social distinctions and advantages,\r\nbut for the use, the productive and commercial use, of the land. The\r\nhorrors of which General Dalrymple spoke, at Arras as elsewhere\r\nthroughout France--here, in the Laonnais and the Soissonnais, in\r\nProvence, in Normandy, in Languedoc--were perpetrated not by a\r\ndowntrodden peasantry, rising to shake off oppression, nor yet in the\r\nfrenzy of a great popular rally to resist a foreign invader. They were\r\nan outburst of crime stimulated, no doubt, as we are now enabled, by\r\nfearless and conscientious investigators of the documentary history of\r\nFrance, to see, by cabals of political conspirators at Paris, just as\r\nthe Gordon riots at London in 1780 were stimulated by anti-Catholic\r\nfanatics. But in both cases the perpetrators were governed by the mere\r\nlust of pillage and destruction. Châteaux were broken into, sacked, and\r\nburned here in the Laonnais and the Soissonnais, as Lord Mansfield's\r\nhouse was broken into, sacked, and burned in London, because they were\r\nfull of valuables to be looted. As the drama went on, other passions\r\ncame into play--passions not less but more ignoble than the mere savage\r\nlust of plunder and destruction. A branded rogue and libeller, Brissot,\r\nhurried back from his exile beyond the Atlantic to compete with Camille\r\nDesmoulins in that noble work of 'denouncing' his fellow-citizens, which\r\nearned for Camille the ghastly title of '_procureur de la lanterne_.'\r\nMadame Roland, 'the soul of the Gironde,' sustained, inspired, and\r\nanimated that most mischievous group with all the concentrated fires of\r\nenvy, jealousy, and revenge, which had smouldered in her own heart from\r\nthe time when, as a girl of seventeen, she had passed a week 'in the\r\ngarrets' of the palace at Versailles with Madame Le Grand, one of the\r\ntirewomen of the Dauphiness. The firmness with which Madame Roland met\r\nher own fate on the scaffold has been sufficiently celebrated in poetry\r\nand in prose. But it is wholesome also to remember the ferocity with\r\nwhich, in the 'glorious' month of July, 1789, a fortnight after the\r\ncapture of the Bastille, she clamoured for the blood of Marie Antoinette\r\nand Louis XVI. In 1771 Marie Phlipon, the engraver's daughter, a girl of\r\nseventeen, educated, as her own Memoirs tell us, on 'Candide,' the\r\n'Confessions of Rousseau,' and the 'Adventures of the Chevalier de\r\nFaublas,' came away from Versailles so gangrened with envy of the\r\nglittering personages among whom she had been condemned to play the part\r\nof a humble spectator, that 'she knew not what to do with the hatred in\r\nher heart.' In 1780 she took as her husband M. Roland, a small\r\nGovernment official. He styled himself M. Roland de la Platière, from\r\nthe name of a small estate which belonged not to him but to his elder\r\nbrother, an excellent priest and canon of Villefranche (who, by the way,\r\nwas guillotined at Lyons in 1793), and in 1781 his young wife made him\r\ntake her to Paris, where they spent some time in vain efforts to secure\r\nletters patent of nobility! The efforts failing, they went back to live\r\nat Lyons, where M. Roland was an inspector of manufactories, and from\r\nLyons, in July, 1789, Madame Roland, now become at last a most\r\nclassical Republican, wrote to her friend M. Bosc (who afterwards\r\npublished her Memoirs), a letter denouncing the timidity of their\r\npolitical friends. 'Your enthusiasm,' she exclaims, 'is only a fire of\r\nstraw! _If the National Assembly does not regularly bring to trial two\r\nillustrious heads, or if some generous imitators of Decius do not strike\r\nthem down, you will all go to the devil._'\r\n\r\nI soften and tone down the final phrase of this extraordinary outburst,\r\nfor though in the original it is but an indecorum as compared with that\r\nfamous passage in the 'Memoirs of Madame Roland' which M. de\r\nSainte-Beuve gracefully describes as 'an immortal act of indecency,' it\r\nis yet an indecorum of a sort more tolerable in the French than in the\r\nEnglish tongue. If the style is the man, the style is also the woman. In\r\n1771 Marie Phlipon 'knew not what to do with the hatred in her heart.'\r\nIn 1789 Marie Roland, then on the eve of her appearance upon the public\r\nstage of the Revolution, had found 'what to do with the hatred in her\r\nheart.'\r\n\r\nIn this letter to Bosc we have the 'soul of the Gironde' _tout entière à\r\nsa proie attachée_. She clung to her regicide purpose with the tenacity\r\nof a tigress. Everything which furthered it she approved, everything\r\nwhich retarded it she denounced. When the king and queen were brought\r\nback captives from Varennes to Paris in June 1791 she wrote, in an\r\necstasy of delight, to Bancal des Issarts, that 'thirty or forty\r\nthousand National Guards surrounded our great brigands'; and her desire\r\nwas that 'the royal mannikin should be shut up, and his wife brought to\r\ntrial.' She was then inclined to favour the scheme of a regency, of\r\nwhich her ally Pétion should be the chief. We know from his own\r\nnauseating account of his conduct while journeying back from Varennes to\r\nParis with the unfortunate royal family, how unbridled were Pétion's\r\ndreams of his own probable share in this regency; and by a very curious\r\ncoincidence a passage in the diary of Gouverneur Morris confirms, on the\r\nauthority of Vicq d'Azyr, the Queen's physician, Pétion's odious\r\nrevelations of his own vanity and vulgarity.\r\n\r\nUnder the spell of this scheme Madame Roland seems for a time to have\r\nsuspended her merciless pursuit of the sovereign whom she hated. She\r\neven got so far as almost to regret the failure of the royal fugitives\r\nto escape. Why? Because their escape 'would have made civil war\r\ninevitable!' These are her own words in a letter written to Bancal des\r\nIssarts, June 25, 1791: 'We can only be regenerated by blood!' This was\r\nthe horrible core of her Republican creed.\r\n\r\nIt made her the ally, the accomplice, the apologist by turns of all the\r\nmost sanguinary wretches who grasped at power in her distracted\r\ncountry--of Marat, when in a spasm of unusual energy La Fayette sought\r\nto suppress his abominable journal; of Robespierre, whose eventual\r\ntriumph was to seal her own fate and that of all her personal friends,\r\nincluding the one man whom in all her life she seems to have\r\npassionately loved; and of Danton, red with the blood of the helpless\r\nprisoners butchered in these massacres of September 1792, of which her\r\nhusband, then a member of what called itself a 'Government' in France,\r\ndid not hesitate publicly, and under his official signature, to speak to\r\nthe people of Paris in these terms: 'I admired the 10th of August; I\r\nshuddered at the consequences of the 2nd of September' (at the\r\nconsequences of the horrors that day perpetrated, as M. Edmond Biré very\r\naptly points out, not at all at the horrors themselves); 'I well\r\nunderstood what must come of the long-deceived patience and of the\r\njustice of the people. I did not inconsiderately blame a first terrible\r\nmovement, but I thought that it was well to prevent its being kept up,\r\nand those who sought to perpetuate it were deceived by their\r\nimagination!'\r\n\r\nThis monstrous language was used by Roland in a placard published on the\r\nwalls of Paris on September 13. The massacres had not then really\r\nceased, and the 'first terrible movement' seemed likely to be followed\r\nby a second not less 'terrible,' which might make things dangerous, not\r\nfor the prisoners huddled under lock and key only, but for certain\r\nmembers of the Legislative Assembly, the Girondists themselves!\r\n\r\nIs it conceivable that now, after a hundred years, rational beings\r\nshould look back with any feelings but those of contempt and horror upon\r\nthese 'patriots' of 1789? Madame Roland, 'the soul of the Gironde,' was\r\nsimply the soul of a conspiracy of ambitious criminals masquerading in\r\nthe guise of philanthropists and philosophers. There is something\r\nbiblical in the dramatic completeness of the chastisement which overtook\r\nthis unhappy woman. 'They that take the sword shall perish by the\r\nsword.'\r\n\r\nThe murder of the king, which Madame Roland did so much to compass, led\r\nnot indirectly to the ruin of her own most trusted political friends and\r\nassociates. The murder of the queen, for which she had longed and\r\nlaboured, was brought to pass, on October 16, 1793, by men who had then\r\nmade up their minds to send herself to the scaffold, and who sent her to\r\nit, three weeks afterwards, on November 8, 1793. In the ridiculous\r\nrevolutionary calendar of the epoch, this date stood as the 18th\r\nBrumaire; Year II. It was celebrated six years afterwards on the 18th\r\nBrumaire of the year VIII. of the Republic, by the advent to supreme\r\nauthority of the Corsican soldier who was to found a despotic empire\r\nupon the results of that 'universal war' into which France had been\r\ninsanely driven by 'the soul of the Gironde.' A mere coincidence, of\r\ncourse! It was a mere coincidence, too, that the Girondist,\r\nDufriche-Valazé, who, at the trial of Louis XVI., especially gratified\r\nthe personal malignity of Madame Roland by the insolence with which he\r\ntreated the royal captive, should have tried to save his own head when\r\nhe and his comrades at last were writhing in the iron grip of\r\nRobespierre, by eagerly denouncing his friend and associate, Valady, as\r\nthe real author of a particularly virulent placard intended by the\r\nGirondists to turn the fury of the Parisian mob against the Jacobins!\r\nSeeing that he had disgraced himself to no purpose, the wretched\r\ncreature, who had contrived to conceal a dagger about his person, drew\r\nit out when the merciless prosecutor, Fouquier-Tinville, rising in his\r\nplace, demanded, on October 29, 1793, that all the Girondists then on\r\ntrial, having been found guilty by the jury--though no plea had been\r\nheard in their defence, and the judge had not summed up--should be\r\ninstantly condemned to suffer death and the confiscation of their\r\nproperty under the Law of December 16, 1792--a law passed by the\r\nGirondists themselves, and highly approved by 'the soul of the Gironde.'\r\n\r\nUnobserved in the general excitement Valazé drove the dagger into his\r\nheart, and crying out, 'I am a dead man!' fell bleeding to the floor.\r\nWhen his companions had been removed by the guards, Fouquier-Tinville\r\nrose again in his place, and requested that the tribunal would order the\r\ncorpse before them to be taken with the living criminals to the Place de\r\nla Révolution, and there with them _guillotined_!\r\n\r\nFrom this even the Convention shrank. But the dead body of Valazé was in\r\nfact carried in a little cart through the streets of Paris, behind the\r\ndismal cortège of the condemned, 'lying stretched upon the back, and the\r\nface uncovered,' on October 31. After the execution was over it was\r\nflung, with the remains of his companions, into a great pit.\r\n\r\nThis was the end, for Madame Roland and her worshippers, in four short\r\nyears, of the 'great reformation' of which, on May 17, 1790, she had\r\nwritten to one of her friends that it could only be carried through by\r\n'burning many more châteaux!'\r\n\r\nFor France, and the French people, the end of it, I fear, has not yet\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nRapine and confiscation have not been unknown, unfortunately, in the\r\nhistory of any civilised State. But under what modern government,\r\nexcepting the government of the first French Republic, has sheer\r\npillage, mere downright robbery, been recognised as a legitimate\r\ninstrument of political propagandism, and, in fact, as a title to\r\nproperty? While the Girondists predominated in France, Brissot,\r\nself-styled de Warville, was their avowed leader; and Brissot, ten years\r\nbefore the Revolution, in his 'Philosophic Researches into the Rights of\r\nProperty, and Robbery considered in the Light of Nature,' published at\r\nChartres in 1780, had laid it down as a great principle that 'exclusive\r\nownership is, in Nature, a real crime.' 'Our institutions,' said this\r\nworthy man, 'punish theft, which is a virtuous action, commended by\r\nNature herself.' Clearly such 'institutions' needed a great reformation.\r\nIt came. France was 'regenerated by blood,' and the disciples of\r\nRousseau widened the area of human happiness, not by burning only, but\r\nby 'looting' all the houses they could break into.\r\n\r\nThe châteaux having been duly pillaged and burned, and their owners\r\ndriven to fly for their lives, the government, controlled by the\r\n'principles' of Brissot, made emigration a crime, seized the remaining\r\nproperty of the 'emigrants,' and turned it over with a national title,\r\nto other people!\r\n\r\nA most interesting and valuable chapter in history is still to be\r\nwritten on the relation of the French Revolution to property in France.\r\nSuch a history cannot be written by the unassisted light of the statutes\r\nand the code. Family records, private correspondence, the reports and\r\ndespatches of the diplomatic agents of the successive French Governments\r\nbetween 1789 and 1799, must all be laid under contribution, if we are to\r\nget at the truth concerning the conditions under which a very large\r\nproportion of the land of France passed during that period, from the\r\nownership of men who had much to lose by the changes of the Revolution,\r\ninto the ownership of men who had everything to gain from those changes.\r\n\r\nThe landed proprietors of France were driven into emigration, not that\r\nFrance might be free--for France was much more free before the\r\nemigration began in 1789 than she was in 1791--but that other people\r\nmight get possession of their estates. Without understanding this, it is\r\nimpossible to understand some of the most atrocious measures adopted,\r\nchiefly while the Girondists were masters, first by the Legislative\r\nAssembly, and then by the Convention, in regard to 'emigrants.'\r\n\r\nThis subject was evidently dealt with in the Assembly and the\r\nConvention, as the American Colonel Swan discovered, in 1791, that the\r\ntobacco question was dealt with--'by a knot of men who disposed of all\r\nthings as they liked, and who turned everything to account.'\r\n\r\nOn October 23, 1792, for example, a decree was adopted inflicting the\r\npenalty of death on any emigrant who should return to France! A\r\nfortnight later, on November 8, 1791, a similar decree made it a\r\ncapital offence for any 'emigrant' to enter a French colony!\r\n\r\nThe first of these decrees was levelled at emigrants whose estates had\r\nbeen seized by the 'popular societies' all over France, and sold, or put\r\nin the way of being sold. The second was aimed at the owners of estates\r\nin such colonies as Hayti, then one of the richest and most flourishing,\r\nas it is now one of the most wretched and uncivilised islands in the\r\nworld. A curious 'Minute Book' of the 'Friends of Liberty' at\r\nPort-au-Prince, which was given to me in 1871 by an old French resident\r\nof Santo Domingo, contains a list of the great proprietors of the\r\nisland, annotated and marked in a way which indicates that a systematic\r\nplan of action against them was either then adopted, or about to be\r\nadopted, by the agents of the 'Friends' at Paris. As the spoliation went\r\non, the decrees became more and more Draconian. In March and April 1793,\r\nit was decreed that 'any person convicted of emigration, or any priest\r\nwithin the category of priests ordered to be transported, who should be\r\nfound on French territory, should be put to death within twenty-four\r\nhours!' As in many cases the question of the crime of emigration was to\r\nbe decided by persons actually enjoying the property of the alleged\r\nemigrant, this short shrift was a most effectual 'warranty of title.'\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1793, it was decreed that, 'any young girl _aged fourteen_\r\nor more, who, having emigrated, should have come back and have then been\r\nsent out of France by the authorities, and who should return to France a\r\nsecond time, should be forthwith _put to death_.' This is perhaps the\r\nmost shamelessly felonious of all these felonious decrees, adopted, be\r\nit remembered, while Madame Roland was still the 'soul of the Gironde,'\r\nand still taking an active part in the preparation and promulgation of\r\nall the acts of the State!\r\n\r\nThe object of this abominable decree was obvious.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the property of families in France was actually saved and\r\ncarried through the tempest of the Revolution by young girls, who\r\nfearlessly faced all the horrors of the time, remained in their homes,\r\nand, supported by a few faithful friends and servants, such as for the\r\ncredit of human nature and the confusion of Schopenhauer, are really\r\nsometimes to be found doing their duty in such emergencies, successfully\r\nmaintained their right to the estates of their fathers. Near the\r\npicturesque old capital of Le Puy in the Haute-Loire, Mademoiselle Irène\r\nde Tencin, after her father was driven from his château, remained there\r\nwith her young brother and a few loyal servants--maintained her rights,\r\ncollected what money she could, bought _assignats_ for gold, and so\r\nbought back the confiscated land and the furniture of her home. A tailor\r\nof Le Puy wished to marry her, and the 'Republican' council threatened\r\nher with death if she refused! 'Death on the spot!' she replied. Then\r\nthey actually locked her up in prison for a year! But she held out to\r\nthe end and carried her young brother safely through until the days of\r\nlaw came back. The decree of March 5, 1793, condemning girls of fourteen\r\nto death in certain cases, was intended to prevent 'emigrants' from\r\nsending back any more daughters of this type to France, to represent the\r\nrights of the family.\r\n\r\nAbout this there can be no manner of doubt. Could a more signal proof\r\nthan this decree affords be given of the essentially predatory and\r\ncriminal direction which was given to the domestic policy of France by\r\nthe 'knot of men who disposed of all things as they liked, and who\r\nturned everything to account'? They had their tentacles out all over\r\nFrance. The 'Sociétés populaires,' of which I have seen it stated by\r\nwriters of authority that no fewer than 52,000 existed, and were at work\r\nin 1792, served them everywhere, the local leaders of these 'societies'\r\nof course sharing with them in the general booty according to their\r\nseveral deserts.\r\n\r\nThe story of a single family in Provence, as told in an admirable\r\nmonograph by M. Forneron, illustrates perfectly the methods and the\r\nresults of this organisation of confiscation in the name of patriotism\r\nand philanthropy.\r\n\r\nWhen the States-General were summoned in 1789 the Marquis de Saporta, a\r\nkinsman of the great house of Crillon, now represented by the Duchesse\r\nd'Uzès, was the seigneur of Montsallier, a domain near the ancient and\r\npicturesque little city of Apt between Avignon and Vaucluse. His own\r\nestate was large, and he had greatly increased it in 1770, by marrying a\r\ndaughter of one of the richest planters in Hayti. Like many other men of\r\nhis rank at that time, he was an ardent admirer of Jean-Jacques\r\nRousseau, and a firm believer in the native nobility and general\r\nperfectibility of man. He was a very popular landlord, and his\r\ngenerosity was equal to his wealth. During six months of a severe famine\r\nhe fed the peasants of Montsallier at his own expense. He was one of the\r\nbelievers in Madame de Staël's man of destiny, her father, the Genevese\r\nbanker, Necker. In November 1790 he was elected constitutional mayor of\r\nApt, and inducted into office 'with much applause' by a solemn service\r\nin the parish church. In February 1791, a local patriot named Reboulin\r\nsurnamed the 'Roman,' and an armourer named Thiebault who had joined the\r\nMarseilles club, and consequently were in correspondence with Paris,\r\norganised a systematic attack upon the Marquis. 'This man,' they said\r\nat Marseilles, 'is an enemy of the constitution by reason of his rank\r\nand of his rage at what is going on. He is a _ci-devant_ noble, who\r\nbecame mayor by intrigues and cabals.'\r\n\r\nFrom that moment no peace was given to the Saporta family till, one by\r\none, they were driven out of France. The Marquis held out bravely as\r\nlong as he could, and was the last to leave. When his wife left he gave\r\nher a passport signed by himself as mayor, in which he described her as\r\nthe 'citoyenne Laporte,' the object of this being that no evidence\r\nshould exist to show that Madame de Saporta had really 'emigrated.' In\r\ndefault of such evidence there was some chance that her property rights\r\nmight be respected.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Directory the Saportas ventured to come back, and\r\nin 1800 they finally recovered so much of their property as had not\r\nbefore that time been sold 'by the State.' There was not much left. A\r\nsister of the Marquis, the Marquise d'Eyragues, who had enjoyed a very\r\nlarge income before the Revolution, wrote to her nephew in 1800 that she\r\nesteemed herself very happy to recover a 'house to live in and two\r\nthousand francs a year.'\r\n\r\nHere in this beautiful region around Laon and Chauny and Coucy, the\r\nstory of those evil days is told almost as instructively by the\r\nproperties which then escaped ruin as by those which, like the estate of\r\nthe Saportas, were confiscated and broken up.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century it was full of fine buildings--châteaux,\r\nchurches, monasteries, hospitals. Go where you please, you come upon the\r\nsites of edifices, once local centres of civilisation, which were\r\npillaged, burned, and demolished, while the 'national agents' ruled the\r\nprovinces for the benefit of the speculators at Paris. Here stood the\r\nstately Château de Molerepaire, of which nothing now remains but a\r\nfarmhouse; there, the ancient parish church of St. Paul at\r\nMons-en-Laonnois, one of the finest in the district, now utterly gone,\r\nall its materials having been sold for the profit of certain 'national\r\nagents' in 1794. Wissignicourt possessed in 1789 one of the most\r\nbeautiful churches in Northern France and two considerable châteaux. The\r\nchurch of St.-Rémi was first robbed of all its ornaments, and finally,\r\nin 1793, completely demolished.\r\n\r\nThe Château de la Cressonnière, built in the sixteenth century by Claude\r\nde Massary, and inhabited by his descendants as resident landlords until\r\nthe Revolution, has entirely disappeared. Of the Château de\r\nWissignicourt, founded in the twelfth century by a baron of the great\r\nPicard family of De Hangest, some portions still exist. But this little\r\ncommune, which occupies one of the most naturally charming sites in the\r\nLaonnois, between Anizy and Laon, is indebted to the 'patriots' of\r\nChauny, who domineered over it during the Revolution, for the\r\nannihilation of local features, which in these days of railway travel\r\nand picturesque tourists would have materially enhanced the value of its\r\nnot very fertile territory. These buildings, these châteaux and\r\nchurches, were part of the accumulated capital of France, and certainly\r\nnot the least important part of the accumulated capital of the commune\r\nof Wissignicourt. If they had been destroyed in the heat of conflict, as\r\nso many such buildings were destroyed in this country during the wars of\r\nreligion, and in Germany, and even in Great Britain, the philosophers\r\nmight have some plausible pretext at least for citing their favourite\r\nproverb that you 'cannot make an omelette without breaking some eggs.'\r\nAnd we might be invited to set off, against this loss of accumulated\r\ncapital, certain important gains in the way of more liberal\r\ninstitutions and an enfranchised industry. But this is not the case.\r\nThe vandalism of the Revolution of 1789 was perpetrated in cold blood. I\r\nspeak, of course, now of the real authors of it all, at Paris, not of\r\nthe mere mobs in the provinces, hot with the sordid lust of plunder or\r\nwith personal spites and rancours--and it was perpetrated for the profit\r\nof those who promoted it. The bronzes and brasses and lead and hammered\r\niron of the desecrated churches were turned into money, and the money\r\nwent into the pockets of the 'patriots.' Monuments that would now be\r\npriceless were destroyed, for example, at St.-Denis, not in the least\r\nthat the metal might be cast into cannon--I am told the military records\r\nshow that the republican armies fought their battles, when finally they\r\ngot to fighting them, exclusively with the artillery of the\r\nmonarchy--but that the metal might be sold in the markets, and the\r\nproceeds confiscated by the vendors. Certain rogues at Chauny and their\r\nemployers in Paris were doubtless the richer a hundred years ago for the\r\ndesecration of the Church of St.-Rémi and the pillage of La Cressonnière\r\nand the Château de Wissignicourt. But Wissignicourt and its people are\r\nthe poorer to-day for these performances.\r\n\r\nAn instructive estimate might be made of the dead loss which the little\r\ncity of Bourg-en-Bresse would have sustained during the past century if\r\nthe sensible Savoyards of that place had not cunningly protected the\r\nmagnificent statue-tombs of Marguerite d'Autriche, Marguerite de Bourbon\r\nand Philibert le Beau in their grand old church of Notre-Dame de Brou,\r\nagainst the rapacity of the revolutionary 'operators,' by cramming the\r\nwhole church full of straw and hay.\r\n\r\nSoissons, in reality one of the very oldest cities in France, the seat,\r\nwhen Cæsar first assailed it, of a Gallic prince, whose authority\r\nextended beyond the Channel into Britain, and the cradle long\r\nafterwards of the first Frankish monarchy, might be taken, so far as\r\nits general aspect goes, for a creation of the Second Empire, were it\r\nnot for its beautiful old cathedral, sadly damaged in 1793, but\r\nvery successfully restored, and for the graceful towers of\r\nSt.-Jean-des-Vignes. These latter were rescued with extreme difficulty\r\nby the townspeople themselves from the felonious fury of the democratic\r\noperators, who despoiled their city for ever of all the rest of that\r\nsuperb castellated abbey. Of St.-Médard without the walls, which, were\r\nit now standing, would be to the history of the French people what\r\nWinchester Cathedral is to the history of the English, only the\r\nsubterranean chapels remain. The materials and the contents of the abbey\r\nitself were turned into cash.\r\n\r\nSt.-Médard-lez-Soissons was only one of eighteen considerable\r\nBenedictine abbeys which down to the Revolution existed within the\r\nlimits of the modern department of the Aisne of which Laon is the chief\r\ntown. Besides these, this region, the early reclamation and cultivation\r\nof which, as I have already said, was chiefly due to the monastic\r\norders, possessed, before 1793, sixteen abbeys and monasteries of the\r\nPremonstratensians. The mother abbey of this great order, founded by\r\nSaint-Norbert in the twelfth century, commemorates in its name the great\r\nagricultural work done by him and his disciples. Prémontré, 'the meadows\r\nof the monastery,' was the chief seat of the Order which a hundred years\r\nago comprised more than eighteen hundred monasteries, the\r\nchapters-general of which were held here. The vast and stately buildings\r\nof Présmontré are still standing. They were constructed on a scale of\r\nroyal grandeur, worthy of the Order, under the Abbé de Muyn, towards the\r\nend of the reign of Louis XIV., and they much resemble the buildings\r\nerected at the same time at the Grande Chartreuse, near Grenoble. Like\r\nthese, they were seized upon in 1793 by the revolutionists. But in both\r\ncases the buildings were saved, those of the Grande Chartreuse because\r\nthere was no temporal use to which they could be put, standing, as they\r\ndo, high up above the gorges of the Guier, in their glorious solitude\r\namid the pine-forests of Dauphiné; and these of Prémontré for exactly\r\nthe opposite reason, because they were available for purposes more\r\nprofitable than the sale of their materials was likely to be. They were\r\nconverted first into a saltpetre factory by the little knot of financial\r\noperators who bought them for a song as 'national property.' Afterwards\r\nan attempt was made to establish glassworks in them. Then they became an\r\norphan asylum, and now they are a great asylum for lunatics!\r\n\r\nSt.-Jean-des-Vignes at Soissons, already mentioned, was the only\r\nmonastery of the Joannists in France, and it was one of fifteen\r\nCistercian abbeys in this region. The remaining ruins of the church of\r\none of these Cistercian abbeys at Longpont, near Soissons, vindicate its\r\nancient fame as one of the jewels of French religious architecture. It\r\nwas built under St.-Louis, and consecrated in his presence. It shared,\r\nin 1793, the fate of the almost equally beautiful church of St.-Leger at\r\nSoissons, the apse, transepts, and cloisters of which, even in their\r\npresent condition, suffice to show what Soissons lost when it was looted\r\nand desecrated. A worthy bishop of Soissons, M. de Garsignies, bought\r\nwhat remained of St.-Leger in 1850, and established there a seminary.\r\n\r\nAdd to these edifices those of twelve commanderies of the Temple, ten\r\ncommanderies of St. John of Jerusalem, two Chartreuses, ten collegiate\r\nchurches, and more than a hundred and fifty priories, nunneries, and\r\nother religious communities, and it will be seen what a grand field of\r\nenterprise and speculation was thrown open in the Laonnais and the\r\nSoissonnais to the disciples of Brissot de Warville and of Condorcet by\r\nthe seizure of the Church property alone.\r\n\r\nScarcely less numerous than the religious edifices in this region were\r\nthe châteaux. Of these comparatively few are now standing, either as\r\npicturesque ruins or as residences. The bas-reliefs and tapestry of the\r\nancient buildings of La Ferté-Milon, the birthplace of Racine, are still\r\nworthy of a visit. Of Nanteuil, a fine château of the time of Francis\r\nI., a single tower remains. The magnificent manor-house of the Ducs de\r\nValois at Villers-Cotterets (a little beyond the limits of the region I\r\nam now treating of) was made an historic monument by Napoleon III.; but\r\nit is none the better for base uses against which it surely ought to\r\nhave been protected as the birthplace of Alexandre Dumas by the ghosts\r\nof Porthos, Athos, and Aramis! The towers and the donjon of the Château\r\nof Nesle on the Somme, whence sallied forth, in the time of Louis XV.,\r\nthe four much too famous sisters De Mailly, were not so maltreated in\r\n1793 as to be quite uninhabitable when the first Napoleon passed a night\r\nthere, during his final struggle for empire; and there still is to be\r\nseen the old Lombard-Roman church of St.-Leger, wherein was held a\r\ncouncil strong enough to coerce Philip Augustus into doing what Henry\r\nVIII. refused, three centuries afterwards, to do, and to make him take\r\nback his divorced queen Ingelburga of Denmark. Braisnes, planted upon a\r\npeak, overlooks what is left of the exquisite twelfth-century church of\r\nSt.-Yved, ruthlessly battered and abused in 1793, and robbed of certain\r\nmatchless monuments in enamelled copper for the benefit of a syndicate\r\nof patriotic rogues. The Châteaux de Gandelu, de Neuville, de\r\nSt.-Lambert are ruins. The lordly cradle of the great House of Guise;\r\nthe tower of Marchais in which, tradition tells us, the League was first\r\nconceived by which the princes of Lorraine were backed in their struggle\r\nfor the throne of France; the keep of Beaurevoir, one of the prisons of\r\nthe Maid of Orléans--these may be seen. Of how many others, the names of\r\nwhich ring out as from a chronicle of French history, nothing but the\r\nnames is left! Caulincourt, Coeuvres d'Estrées, de Bohain de\r\nLuxembourg, d'Armentières, de Conflans, de Condé, de Comin, de Buzancy,\r\nde Puységur.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most important châteaux in this region in 1789 were those of\r\nPinon and of Anizy. The first still exists, and stands substantially as\r\nit then stood, and is now admittedly the finest in the Laonnais. The\r\nsecond was wrecked and demolished. It is perhaps worth while to tell\r\nwhat befell Anizy, and how Pinon escaped.\r\n\r\nBoth Anizy and Pinon are of very ancient origin.\r\n\r\nAnizy seems to have been a fortress of the Emperor Valentinian in the\r\nfourth century, and it was pillaged by the Vandals in the fifth. On\r\nDecember 26, 496, Clovis, in recognition of the baptism he had received\r\non the preceding day at the hands of St.-Rémi in the cathedral church of\r\nReims, gave the lordships of Anizy, Coucy, and Leuilly to that prelate.\r\nTwo years afterwards St.-Rémi, who had made Laon a bishopric, gave Anizy\r\nto his nephew St.-Génébaud, the first bishop of Laon, to be held and the\r\nrevenues thereof to be applied by the bishops of Laon for ever to the\r\nbenefit of the poor of that diocese. He coupled the gift with a solemn\r\ncurse and anathema upon all who should ever disturb or misapply the\r\ndonation. From that time to 1789 Anizy was a lordship of the bishops of\r\nLaon, who in time were made dukes and peers of France.\r\n\r\nThe annals of Laon attest the loyalty through long ages of the bishops\r\nof Laon to the injunctions laid upon them by St.-Rémi. The Normans came\r\nto Anizy, for example, in 883, and pillaged and ruined the place. Four\r\nyears afterwards the bishop of Laon founded there a hospital, or\r\nHôtel-Dieu, for the poor and infirm of the diocese, and the king,\r\nCharles le Gros, endowed it handsomely. In 904 Jeanne, sister of Raoul,\r\nbishop of Laon, with the help of her brother, founded at Anizy a priory\r\nof Sisters to receive and care for the young girls of the place. In 996,\r\nAdalberon, bishop of Laon, founded a maladrerie, or lepers' hospital, at\r\nAnizy, to be 'a refuge and place of healing for the poor of Anizy,\r\nWissignicourt, and Pinon.'\r\n\r\nAs time went on and the feudal system became more fully developed, the\r\nbishops of Laon found it judicious to establish one of those high feudal\r\npersonages known as Vidames, and the relations of the Vidames of Laon\r\nwith their episcopal superior, on the one hand, and with the people of\r\nsuch lordships as Anizy on the other, become very interesting.\r\n\r\nThey are made more interesting still by the entrance upon the scene of\r\nthe kings of France, contending for a real royal authority, of great\r\nbarons like the Sires de Coucy bent on getting a complete local\r\nindependence of any central government, and of the people of the\r\ncommunes, who very early saw their own game as between the Church, the\r\nbarons, and the king, and played it here, as in so many other places,\r\nwith most respectable skill and success. There is a picturesque story of\r\nPope Benedict VIII., who held a council at Laon, going from Laon to view\r\nthe episcopal château at Anizy, with a _cortège_ of cardinals and\r\nbishops, and on the way springing down nimbly from his horse to rescue\r\nthe bishop of Cambray, obviously a prelate of much weight, under whom a\r\nlittle bridge gave way as they were crossing the river Lette. This was\r\nin the year 1018. A century later, in 1110, Gandri, bishop of Laon,\r\nsummoned John Comte de Soissons, Robert II. Comte de Flandre, and\r\nEnguerrand I. Sire de Coucy, the three loftiest and lordliest personages\r\nthen of this part of the world, to a conference at his château in Anizy,\r\nthere to fix and define where the authority of the Sire de Coucy ended\r\nand that of the bishops of Laon began. In 1210 the burgh of Anizy became\r\na free commune and elected its first mayor. The next year its seigneur,\r\nRobert de Châtillon, bishop-duke of Laon, at his own cost fortified the\r\nplace with walls and towers, and did this so well that three years\r\nafterwards Enguerrand III. de Coucy, just then the most masterful person\r\nin all this part of France, thought it wise to treat with the\r\nbishop-duke as to their respective rights of ownership in the adjoining\r\nforest of Roncelais. They agreed so perfectly that the formidable lord\r\nof Coucy immediately afterwards did the bishop-duke and the people of\r\nAnizy the notable service of leading a band of his retainers against a\r\ncompany of brigands who were burning lonely farmhouses and carrying off\r\nthe crops.\r\n\r\nHaving got their mayor and their walls and their towers, the burghers of\r\nAnizy took to quarrelling with the bishop-dukes of Laon, and so got\r\ntheir communal rights suppressed by one of those prelates in 1230, only\r\nto see them re-established again half a century later in 1278, by\r\nanother bishop-duke, Geoffroi de Beaumont, who made a compromise with\r\nhis troublesome vassals, reserving only to himself the right to nominate\r\nthe officers of justice. The king of France, Philippe le Hardi, be it\r\nobserved, took sides with the burghers in this affair, and they raised a\r\nmonument to him in 1293.\r\n\r\nThis, with almost everything else of any importance in Anizy, was\r\ndestroyed by the English of Edward III., in the next century, one of the\r\nlocal seigneurs, the lord of Locq (where a château still represents the\r\nextinct lordship) and the curé of the church of St.-Peter falling\r\nvaliantly in the defence of their people. The bishop-duke came over to\r\nhelp them from Laon, and died in his château at Anizy the next year.\r\n\r\nIn 1352, another bishop-duke founded a free market at Anizy for three\r\ndays in each year, at the feast of St.-George, and in 1408 his successor\r\nbuilt a grain-hall there. In 1513 Louis XII. granted the burghers a free\r\nmarket every Monday. This so incensed the then bishop-duke, Louis de\r\nBourbon-Vendôme, that he tried to suppress the annual market and take\r\nback the grain-hall, in return for which attempts the worthy burghers\r\npillaged his château at Anizy and pulled it nearly to pieces.\r\n\r\nClearly the seigneurs did not have things all their own way in these\r\ngood old times! For after several years of contention Louis de\r\nBourbon-Vendôme came to terms with his burghers, and matters were put\r\nupon so friendly a footing that, in 1540, the bishop-duke began the\r\nerection at Anizy of a new château, to be surrounded with an extensive\r\nand beautiful park. The plans were made by the first architects and\r\nartists of the Renaissance; the sculptors of Francis I. were employed to\r\ndecorate the façade with statues--the new buildings were connected with\r\nwhat remained of the earlier château by a grand gallery; pavilions\r\nflanked the main edifice and adorned the grand cour d'honneur. King\r\nFrancis, during his stay at Folembray, frequently visited his cousin the\r\nBishop-duke in this château, one of the great chambers of which was long\r\nknown as the room of King Francis. When Louis de Bourbon-Vendôme died\r\nin 1557, the château was not entirely finished, and a lawsuit followed\r\nhis death, between his personal heirs and the bishop-dukes for the\r\npossession of the buildings. It lasted for nearly a century, and when\r\nthe prelates at last were declared to be the owners, in 1645, the\r\nstately edifice had fallen into a sad state of dilapidation. The\r\nCardinal d'Estrées restored the façade in 1660, but one of his\r\nsuccessors actually unroofed it and sold the lead. In 1750, a\r\nbishop-duke of quite another type, the Cardinal de Rochechouart, spent\r\ngreat sums of money upon it, restored it, and decorated it throughout,\r\nand made it one of the noblest residences in this part of France. At the\r\nsame time he put in order all the public buildings of Anizy, and had the\r\nroads carefully paved throughout the borough. He was followed by a\r\nprelate of a like mind, Louis de Sabran, the last bishop-duke of Laon,\r\nwho is still remembered in his episcopal city for his public spirit and\r\nhis benevolence, and who made the park of Anizy his special care.\r\n\r\nThen came the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, the local 'directory' of the district of Chauny laid violent\r\nhands upon the château. It was in great part demolished, and what was\r\nleft of it defaced. It was robbed of its precious furniture, pictures,\r\nand ornaments, its valuable chimney-pieces, its elaborate iron and brass\r\nwork. The old trees were cut down in the park, and the railings\r\ndestroyed. The fine old church of Ste.-Geneviève at the same time was\r\nfirst turned into a hall of meeting for the electors, who distrusted\r\neach other so profoundly that when their first meeting was held, May 3,\r\n1790, the documents relating to the elections were locked up in a\r\nconfessional, lest they should be stolen, and then deliberately wrecked\r\nand looted by the 'friends of Liberty,' or, in other words, by a squad\r\nof ruffians from Chauny and the neighbourhood, who, after putting on\r\nthe sacerdotal vestments, marched about the church carrying the daïs,\r\nbeat the crosses and the carved stalls to pieces, smashed and defaced\r\nthe monuments and the altars, broke open the poor-box, and carried off\r\nall that was worth stealing. The stone slabs from the graves were sold,\r\na saltpetre factory was established in the church, the presbytery was\r\nmade a town-hall, and the 'worship of Reason,' in the person of a young\r\nwoman of Chauny, was solemnly inaugurated at Anizy! The château and the\r\npark were sold by the self-constituted dictators of Anizy to one M. Orry\r\nde Sainte-Marie on August 7, 1792, for a nominal price. This M. Orry\r\nseems to have been an 'operator.' For in June, 1793, he sold the château\r\nto the 'ci-devant Vicomtesse de Courval,' the mother of the then owner\r\nof the Château of Pinon, about which I shall presently have something to\r\nsay, and bought it back from her again in March 1795, leaving her the\r\nright to enjoy it until her death, which took place in 1806. All this\r\ncuriously illustrates the perils and uncertainties of land-ownership in\r\nsuch times! In 1808, Orry de Sainte-Marie, having by that time become a\r\njustice of the peace at Anizy, and doubtless a fervent Imperialist, sold\r\nthe château to M. Collet, Director of the Mint at Paris. From him it\r\npassed by sale, in 1824, to M. Senneville, and in 1841 to M. Lafont de\r\nLaunoy.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to Pinon, two kilomètres to the south of Anizy, long one\r\nof the chief seats of the power of the famous Sires de Coucy, one of\r\nwhom seems to have been the real author of the arrogant motto since, in\r\none or another form, attributed to more than one great family in France:\r\n\r\n    Roi ne suis\r\n  Ne prince, ne comte aussy:\r\n    Je suis le Sire de Coucy.\r\n\r\nThe Château of Pinon was originally built by Enguerrand II. of Coucy in\r\nthe twelfth century. His grandfather Enguerrand I. had been invited by\r\nthe Archbishop of Reims to establish himself at Pinon, which was a part\r\nof the splendid Christmas gift made by Clovis to the see of Reims, as I\r\nhave already stated, after his baptism at Reims; and Enguerrand II., who\r\nappears to have been a typical baron, finding the place favourable for\r\nthe feudal industry of levying toll on trade and commerce, there erected\r\na great castle, one of the many legendary castles to be found all over\r\nEurope which boasted a window for every day in the year. He thought fit,\r\nhowever, to select for this castle a site which belonged to the Abbey of\r\nSt.-Crispin the Great at Soissons, and thus got himself into trouble\r\nwith the Church. Strong as he was, he found the Church too strong for\r\nhim. The Bishop of Soissons compelled him to agree to pay an annual and\r\nperpetual rent to the Abbey, and made him also take the cross and go to\r\nthe Holy Land to expiate his sacrilege. There he fell in battle. The\r\ngrandson of this baron, Robert de Coucy, in 1213 granted the people of\r\nPinon 'a right of assize according to the use and custom of Laon,' and\r\nthe next year founded there a hospital. Twenty years afterwards Pinon\r\nbecame a commune, and John de Coucy granted the inhabitants a free\r\nmarket. The Château of Pinon passed in the 14th century to the elder\r\nbranch of the great house of de Coucy, and in 1400 it was sold, under\r\nduress to Louis of France (Duc d'Orléans) by the last heiress of the\r\nhouse Marie de Coucy, daughter of Enguerrand VII. by his first wife\r\nIsabel, Princess Royal of England, and eldest daughter of Edward III. by\r\nPhilippa of Hainault.\r\n\r\nA hundred years afterwards Louis XII. had taken possession of the\r\nestates and the château, and made a gift of these to his daughter\r\nClaude de France. In spite of this, however, the property passed into\r\nthe hands of the ancient family of De Lameth, and towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century the Château de Pinon witnessed one of the most\r\nromantic and abominable murders recorded in the annals of French\r\ngallantry.\r\n\r\nAs Pinon is still, after all the chances and changes of seven hundred\r\nyears, the finest inhabited château in the Soissonnais, and as, by a\r\ncurious throw of the dice of Destiny, it now belongs to a fair\r\ncompatriot of mine, perhaps I may be allowed to tell this somewhat\r\ngruesome tale, which has a flavour rather Italian than French.\r\n\r\nCharles Marquis d'Albret, the last of that illustrious race, Prince de\r\nMortagne and Comte de Massant, was the nephew of the Maréchal d'Albret,\r\nand he came therefore, on the mother's side, of the royal blood of Henry\r\nof Navarre.\r\n\r\nHe loved, not wisely but too well, Henriette de Roucy, Comtesse de\r\nLameth, called 'la belle Picarde,' whose husband was seigneur of the\r\nChâteau de Pinon. In August 1678, the Marquis d'Albret was at the\r\nChâteau de Coucy with the army of Flanders, then commanded by the\r\nMarshal-Duke of Schomberg, who afterwards fell fighting for King William\r\nIII. in Ireland at the battle of the Boyne.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Lameth, who had in some way discovered the relations which\r\nexisted between his wife, 'la belle Picarde,' and the Marquis d'Albret,\r\nshut the comtesse into a room at Pinon, and compelled her, by threats\r\nand violence, to write a letter to the marquis giving him a rendezvous\r\nat Pinon. On the day mentioned in her letter the Comte de Lameth ordered\r\nsix horses to be put to his coach, and (having previously put his wife\r\nunder watch and ward) drove off with an escort to Laon. News of this was\r\ncarried at once to Coucy. The Marquis set forth with a single attendant\r\non horseback to Chavignon, where at the hostelry of La Croix Blanche, he\r\nwas met, as from the letter of his lady-love he expected to be, by a\r\nservant from the Château de Pinon.\r\n\r\nArmed only with pistols in his holsters, he mounted after dark and rode\r\non from Chavignon to Pinon. There, as he entered the park-gates, just\r\nafter midnight, three men, one of them Jocquet, the valet de chambre of\r\nthe Comte de Lameth, sallied out upon him from under an archway, and,\r\nfeigning to take him for a robber, opened fire upon him. He killed one\r\nof his assailants, and then himself fell.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years ago, the then proprietor of Pinon was building a lodge\r\nfor one of his keepers when the workmen came upon a gold ring in digging\r\nfor the foundation. It bore the engraved name of D'Albret, and the name\r\nof the royal regiment which he commanded. He had doubtless been buried\r\nwhere he fell in the park.\r\n\r\nThis proprietor was the father of the late Baron de Courval, formerly an\r\nofficer in the French army, who, during the Second Empire, married Miss\r\nRay of New York.\r\n\r\nThe De Courvals became possessors of Pinon through the murder of the\r\nMarquis d'Albret. The way in which this came about curiously illustrates\r\nthe course of justice and injustice under the _ancien régime_. This\r\ndiffered more in form than in fact from the course of justice and\r\ninjustice in our own time. Claude, Comte de Lameth, the jealous husband\r\nof 'la belle Picarde,' was a great personage, not only Comte de Lameth\r\nbut Vicomte de Laon, d'Anizy, de Marchy, and de Croix, and seigneur of\r\nBayencourt, Pinon, Bouchavannes, Clacy, Laniscourt, Quincy, '_et autres\r\nlieux_.' But the Marquis d'Albret was a greater personage still, and\r\nthe widow of the marquis, who refused to believe the story of his affair\r\nwith 'la belle Picarde,' was a _dame d'atours_ of the queen, Marie\r\nThérèse. So also was the cousin-german of the marquis, and these two\r\ndames made such a clamour about the murder that the king, Louis XIV.,\r\nand of course with the king the whole court, so waged war against the\r\nComte de Lameth that his whole family found it wise to seek safety in\r\nflight, and fearing the confiscation of all his property, the Comte\r\n(whose wife had previously gone into an Ursuline convent) sold the\r\nestate and Château of Pinon, with other estates, to his friend Pierre\r\nDubois de Courval, president of the parliament of Paris.[8]\r\n\r\n    [8] The venom of this old history recurs in the Revolution,\r\n    poisoning the minds of three Lameths, concerning whom Mr. Carlyle\r\n    indulges in much quite unnecessary and grotesque emotion.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 Dubois de Courval pulled down the ancient Château de Pinon, and,\r\non the designs of Mansard, built the present stately and imposing\r\nedifice. Le Nôtre laid out for him also the extensive park, and, when he\r\ndied, in 1764, he left Coucy-la-Ville and Fresnes to his elder son, and\r\nto his younger, with the title of Vicomte de Courval, the château and\r\nestates of Pinon.\r\n\r\nIt was the widow of this younger son, Aimé-Louis Dubois de Courval, who,\r\nas I have already said, saved what could be saved of the Château of\r\nAnizy in 1793 by buying it from the enterprising M. Orry de\r\nSainte-Marie.\r\n\r\nHer husband, a man of worth and of note in the parliament of Paris, died\r\non the very eve of the great troubles, December 1, 1788. He was then in\r\nhis sixty-seventh year, and as he had done nothing but good at Pinon,\r\nnot only embellishing the château and the park, but giving much time and\r\nmoney to improve the condition of the people, he would probably have\r\nbeen sent to the guillotine at Paris by the local 'directory at Chauny'\r\nhad he lived long enough, and his property confiscated, like the\r\nproperty of the bishops and dukes at Anizy. His oldest son was a lad of\r\nfifteen when the storm burst in 1789. His mother took his interests\r\nresolutely in hand. She came of two aristocratic stocks, the Millys and\r\nthe Clermonts-Tonnerre, but she got the better of the democrats. Like\r\nold Madame Dupin at Chenonceaux, she carried herself and her property,\r\nby woman's wit and woman's will, through the Revolution. In 1791 she\r\ncontrived to get her son, then only seventeen, elected commander of the\r\nNational Guard at Anizy. He ripened rapidly, under the stress of the\r\ntimes, bought up the 'patriots' when it was necessary--and there is\r\nabundant evidence to show that they were always in the market, even at\r\nParis and during the worst times of the Terror--was made a baron of the\r\nempire by Napoleon, elected President of the Canton of Anizy in 1811, a\r\ncouncillor-general of the Aisne in the same year, and deputy in 1814.\r\nWith the Restoration he became once more Vicomte de Courval and seigneur\r\nof Pinon, having long before converted the park and gardens of the\r\nchâteau into the 'English style,' with fine watercourses and an\r\nextensive lake, and died quietly at Paris in 1822. In 1794, at the age\r\nof twenty, he married a daughter of the Marquis de Saint-Mars.\r\n\r\nHis son and successor, Ernest-Alexis Dubois de Courval, was taken\r\ninto high favour by Charles X., but was nevertheless made a\r\ncouncillor-general of the Aisne under Louis Philippe. He married the\r\nonly daughter of Moreau, who was a child of nine years old when her\r\nfather fell fighting against France and Napoleon in 1813. In a curious\r\nGothic tower which he built at Pinon are still preserved some of the\r\nstandards captured from the enemies of France by Moreau, and these I am\r\nassured are the only such standards, excepting those of the Invalides,\r\nrecovered through the efforts of the House of Peers, which existed in\r\nFrance before the Crimean War. In this tower the Vicomte de Courval\r\nformed a remarkable collection of mediæval arms and armour, antique\r\nfurniture, stained glass, medals and coins. This region is very rich not\r\nonly in Roman remains, but in druidical stones and other vestiges of the\r\nraces which dwelt here before Cæsar came. Marcus Aurelius, Trajan,\r\nHadrian, Alexander Severus, Probus, Gordian, Constantine and Constantius\r\nare all represented on the coins found in and around the property of M.\r\nde Courval; but one of his most interesting acquisitions was a silver\r\ncoin bearing the name of Clovis, with the title of 'imperator.' There is\r\na record at Anizy of a treasure of coins of Aurelius, found there so\r\nlong ago as in the middle of the twelfth century; and under the\r\nbishop-dukes of Laon a collection of Roman coins and vases was gradually\r\nformed at the mairie of Anizy, which 'disappeared' soon after the\r\n'patriots' of Chauny undertook to 'liberate' that commune.\r\n\r\nThe American Vicomtesse de Courval, who now owns Pinon, and passes a\r\npart of each year there, is the widow of a son of this Ernest de\r\nCourval.\r\n\r\nLooking backward dispassionately over this 'centennial record' of two\r\nconsiderable estates in the Department of the Aisne, what advantages,\r\nsocial, political, or economical, can be shown to have enured to the\r\npeople of the commune of Anizy and of Pinon from the revolutionary\r\nprocesses to which those estates were subjected a hundred years ago? Not\r\na man in Anizy or in Pinon owns a rood of land now which he might not\r\njust as easily have owned had the alienation of the Church property in\r\nthose communes been conducted through the gradual and systematic\r\nprocesses of law and order. Instead of one remarkable and interesting\r\nchâteau, these communes would now possess two, each in the natural\r\ncourse of things, a centre of local activity and civilisation. Instead\r\nof one ancient church, much despoiled and damaged, Anizy would now\r\npossess three such churches, each in its own way an object of interest\r\nto architects and artists, and it would be possible for an honest\r\ngendarme or a poor labourer on the highway to hear mass, if he liked, in\r\nany one of them, without incurring the wrath of his superiors and the\r\nloss of his daily bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nIN THE AISNE--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n  LAON\r\n\r\nThe lofty hill on which the Sires de Coucy planted their chief fortress\r\nrises above the fields and forests of the Soissonnais as the Mont\r\nSt.-Michel rises above the waves and the sands of the Norman coast.\r\n\r\nThe narrow streets and quaint old houses of the little town of\r\nCoucy-le-Château are huddled around the outworks of the colossal castle,\r\nalmost as closely as are the climbing streets and the terraced houses of\r\nSt.-Michel around the martial monastery; and each of these two places\r\nis, in its own kind, unique.\r\n\r\nI had been strongly recommended to pass the night when I visited the\r\nchâteau, not in the little city itself, though it boasts a 'Hôtel des\r\nRuines,' but at a little wayside inn, rather indeed a restaurant and a\r\nbaiting-place for travellers by the highway than an inn, which stands at\r\nthe foot of the hill of Coucy. I took the advice, and had no cause to\r\nrepent it. The walk up the hill, of some two miles, to the tower and the\r\ncastle was simply delightful on a fine afternoon in June. Opposite my\r\nlittle inn is a small and rather dilapidated château of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, which originally must have been a very pleasant residence; and\r\nin the extensive meadows about it were grazing a number of fine cattle,\r\nthe property of M. de Vaublanche. 'He is the only man hereabouts who\r\ntakes any trouble with his beasts,' said my cheery, athletic young\r\nhost, and leading the way for me into the meadows, he pointed out the\r\nprinces of the herd, all of them really fine animals of the best French\r\nbreeds, with as much pride as if he had been the owner. 'It gives more\r\npleasure to see these--does it not, sir?--than to look at yonder dead\r\nchimney,' he said, pointing to some extensive sugarworks, all closed and\r\ndeserted, on the other side of the road. The sugar crisis has been very\r\nsharp here, as in other parts of France, and many smokeless chimneys are\r\nto be seen here as in other departments.\r\n\r\nAn embattled gateway of the thirteenth century welcomes the traveller\r\nnow with its open arch as he approaches the town of Coucy, and the best\r\nviews of the château are to be got from the road as you climb up the\r\nlong ascent.\r\n\r\nIn the quaint little town the house is still carefully preserved, and\r\nthe chamber itself religiously kept in order, in which, on June 7, 1594,\r\nGabrielle d'Estrées gave birth to a son destined afterwards to make his\r\nmark in the military annals of France as César, Duc de Vendôme. An\r\ninscription on a tablet in the wall thus commemorates his advent into\r\nthe world: 'In this chamber was born, and in the chamber above was\r\nbaptized, the legitimised son of France, de Vendôme, a prince of very\r\ngood hopes, the child of the most Christian, most magnanimous, most\r\ninvincible, and most clement King of France and of Navarre, Henry IV.,\r\nand of Gabrielle d'Estrées, Duchesse de Beaufort.'\r\n\r\nNot far from this house is the ancient belfry of Coucy, wherein swings a\r\nbell of dolorous prestige, the tradition of Coucy averring that,\r\nwhenever a citizen of Coucy is about to die, this bell tolls of itself,\r\nand is heard by him alone.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the communal schoolmaster will ere long drive this tradition\r\nout of the mind of the rising generation in Coucy. If so I trust, though\r\nI hardly expect, that he will drive out with it another and more\r\nmischievous tradition, born within the precincts of the ancient castle.\r\nNot once, but a dozen times, this year in different parts of France, I\r\nhave seen allusions made, in political journals, to the monstrous right\r\nwhich the seigneurs of old possessed and exercised of hanging small boys\r\nfor snaring and killing rabbits within their parks and woods. The old\r\ngame laws of France, like the old game laws, and indeed like many other\r\nold laws, of England and of other countries, were not over-mild. Was not\r\na woman first strangled and then burned in England for 'coining' in the\r\nyear 1789, while the States-General were performing at Paris their\r\nfantastic overture to the ghastly drama of the Terror? Yet England in\r\n1789 knew a great deal more of personal liberty than France knows now in\r\n1889. The tradition of the seignorial right of hanging boys for killing\r\nrabbits originated, it is probable, with Enguerrand IV., Sire de Coucy,\r\nof whom it is told that, exasperated by three young lads, scholars of\r\nthe monastic school of Saint-Nicolas-aux-Bois, whom he found shooting at\r\nrabbits and hares in his woods with bows and arrows, he had the lads\r\nseized and hanged. So far from doing this within his seignorial rights,\r\nhowever, was the Sire de Coucy, that the monks proceeded against him\r\nvigorously, and Saint-Louis had him arrested for it, and was with much\r\ndifficulty restrained by the barons of the realm from hanging him in his\r\nturn. He was only pardoned on very severe conditions, one of which was\r\nthat he should do penance for a number of years in his own castle of\r\nCoucy, where, the chroniclers tell us, he died 'in shame and\r\nrepentance.' His successor, Enguerrand V., took the matter so much to\r\nheart that he led the life of an anchorite at Coucy, and had himself\r\nburied in the Abbey of Prémontré near the doorway; like Alonzo de Ojeda\r\nthe Conquistador, the slab upon whose grave I saw some years ago at the\r\nentrance of the ruined church of San Francisco in Santo Domingo, with an\r\ninscription reciting that he was there laid to rest, by his own request,\r\nas a great sinner, upon whose ashes all who passed should tread.\r\n\r\nTortuous little streets lead through the town of Coucy into a great\r\ngreen space which commands the castle. It is approached from the new and\r\nrather pretentious lodge in which the keeper of the castle now resides,\r\nthrough one of the finest and loftiest avenues in France. But the\r\ntallest trees are dwarfed by the gigantic donjon tower. This rises to a\r\nheight still of at least 180 feet. It is 150 feet in circumference at\r\nthe base, and slopes very gradually to the summit. The hall on the\r\nground floor measures more than forty feet in diameter, the walls being\r\nof enormous thickness. Over one of the doorways is a defaced bas-relief\r\nrepresenting a lion attacked and slain by Enguerrand I. de Coucy. The\r\nchimney-place in the ground floor hall would make a very respectable\r\nmodern house, and there is a well within the hall said to be of unknown\r\ndepth. The donjon consists of three storeys above the ground floor, the\r\nmain hall on the first floor being particularly remarkable for its\r\nheight. The vaulted ceiling of this hall must have been very fine, and\r\nthroughout it is apparent that the builders of the Château de Coucy had\r\nthe comfort of the inmates and a certain stately elegance of effect much\r\nmore in mind than was common with the builders of castles in the\r\nthirteenth century. The walls at the summit are more than nine feet\r\nthick, and they were doubtless surmounted originally with a great\r\ncircular gallery of wood covered in with a roof. The Sires de Coucy,\r\nlike other crusaders, doubtless brought back all manner of rich carpets\r\nand stuffs from the East, and with these and the wonderful carved chests\r\nand massive woodwork of the time the Château de Coucy may well have been\r\na much more agreeable place of abode than, from our modern acquaintance\r\nwith their winding stone stairways and denuded walls, we are apt to\r\nimagine these great feudal fortresses to have been.\r\n\r\nThe views from the summit now are simply superb. The vast forests over\r\nwhich Enguerrand, the builder, gazed, seeking out the sites on which he\r\nplanted so many strongholds--(it is known that besides Coucy he erected\r\nat least eight other castles, from Folembray to Saint-Lambert)--have\r\nbeen replaced in great part by fertile fields and smiling towns. But the\r\nland is still richly wooded. Far down, in a little wilderness beneath\r\nus, the guardian pointed out to me an odd edifice looking like a\r\ncombination of a modern Gothic church with a seaside villa. This, he\r\ntold me, was the residence of a distinguished artist of Paris, who\r\npasses a part of every year in this region, making studies of forest\r\nscenery. Beyond this, in a large park, is a château of the Marquis de la\r\nChâtaigneraie, once a part of the domain of Coucy.\r\n\r\nThe enceinte of the château is of enormous extent. The solidity of the\r\nwalls and the towers resisted so successfully the mines and pickaxes of\r\nRichelieu that the great outlines of the immense building are still\r\neasily definable, with fine traces of the architecture of the great\r\nchapel. That St.-Louis and Henry IV. visited Coucy we know, and the\r\nguardian was good enough to give me very minute and particular\r\ninformation as to the chambers which they occupied.\r\n\r\nHe was a curious fellow, this guardian, an Alsatian immigrant, he\r\ninformed me. The people here, he thought, were not so much pleased as\r\nthey ought to be that the Government had given him the place, which\r\nbrings him in 400 francs a year, with the lodge I have mentioned for a\r\nresidence, and the right to all the crops of any kind he can raise on\r\nthe land attached to the château. He was then cutting the grass, which\r\ngrew very well within the precincts of the château. But he took great\r\npains to impress upon me that he was doing this, not so much for the\r\nsake of the hay he expected to make as for the accommodation of visitors\r\nlike myself, 'to make the ground pleasanter to walk upon.'\r\n\r\nThis was an attention which no right-minded person could fail to\r\nrecognise with a _pour-boire_, particularly as the worthy guardian\r\ncomplained of the extremely poor quality of the wine grown about Coucy.\r\nI told him I had always heard that King Francis I. insisted on having\r\nhis wine sent to him from this place. 'Ah!' he replied, 'in those days\r\nwhat did they know about good wine?'\r\n\r\nThe rooks in countless numbers were flying and cawing all over the\r\nbeautiful old place. 'I have tried to kill these birds,' said the\r\nguardian wearily. 'They destroy my peas. But the cartridges cost too\r\nmuch, and I have had to give it up.' He had been in his place four\r\nmonths. I might think it very pleasant seeing it in June. But if I could\r\nsee it in February, with the wind howling 'through the tall trees and\r\naround the huge tower!'\r\n\r\nOn my return to my neat little hostelry my host came out to meet me. 'He\r\nhad just heard that four councillors-general, on their way home from a\r\nmeeting, would like to dine at his house. Would I object to their dining\r\nwith me--there was no other good room?' Naturally I was only too glad to\r\nshare the room and the dinner with them. A very good dinner it was too.\r\n'Men learn to cook, but are born to roast.' My host's cook was born to\r\nroast both fat chickens and a capital leg of mutton. One of the\r\ncouncillors-general, when they drove up, went out into the kitchen to\r\nexamine and report upon the outlook. He came back presently rubbing his\r\nhands together with glee. 'Admirable!' he exclaimed; 'it will be a\r\nBelshazzar's feast--a superb leg of mutton, truly superb!'\r\n\r\n'The first green peas of the season here!' said our host, coming in with\r\nthem. 'You will see if they are good. They come late here, the green\r\npeas, but you see what they are when they do come.'\r\n\r\nThe four councillors-general were all Republicans. One of them, a\r\ncountry banker, as I learned, was a trifle sarcastic about the prospects\r\nof the party. 'They are too soft,' he said, 'at Paris. They lack wrist.\r\nThey do not hit hard enough. What we want is a man; where are we to find\r\nhim?' Another, a tall grey-bearded man, an attorney, agreed with the\r\nbanker as to the 'softness' of the authorities. 'I am a Republican of\r\nyesterday,' he said. 'I remember, under the Empire, how, when I spoke at\r\nChauny, I spoke with a gendarme at the table behind me, and a couple of\r\nspies in the hall. That is what we should have now in these meetings\r\nwhere they abuse the Republic.' I observed that while this councillor,\r\nby the way, always spoke of 'the Republic,' the banker as invariably\r\nspoke of 'the Republican party.' They both agreed, however, and their\r\ncompanions agreed with them, that the real want was the 'want of a man.'\r\n\r\n'The President is doing well though,' said the grey-bearded 'Republican\r\nof yesterday.' 'He is beginning to stand out against the horizon, is he\r\nnot?' The others were not so sure of this, and then there arose a most\r\nlively and singularly outspoken exchange of views as to the different\r\nleaders of the Republican party. It would be hardly fair for me to cite\r\nthese; but one remark made by the banker, in regard to a very\r\nconspicuous political personage, amused me. 'Yes,' he said in reply to\r\none of his companions: 'yes; ---- is skilful--very skilful--but he has no\r\nforesight. Would you trust him with your pocket-book? No!' 'Oh certainly\r\nnot!'\r\n\r\nIt seemed they had been attending a conference about agriculture. They\r\nwere all agreed as to the existence of 'an agricultural crisis,' but\r\nbeyond that they seemed to be at sea. One councillor was quite sure that\r\nthe thing to be done was to get the farmers to use cattle instead of\r\nhorses in their work. The cattle cost less, worked as well, and they\r\ncould be killed for beef. They were also more valuable as fertilisers.\r\nUpon this another councillor, apparently the only agriculturist of the\r\ncompany, went into a disquisition on chemical fertilisers and the\r\nscientific applications of them.\r\n\r\n'I never believed in these chemicals,' he said, 'till last year. But\r\nlast year I was in my fields, talking with my neighbour So-and-so, who\r\nhas spent I know not how much on these chemicals. He went away with his\r\nmen after a while, and I saw they had been applying their chemicals to a\r\nfield sown like mine. An idea occurred to me. I went and brought a\r\nbasket. I stepped across into their field and took a certain quantity of\r\ntheir chemicals. These I applied in a particular part of my field. Do\r\nyou know the plants came up there wonderfully--but really quite\r\nwonderfully! There is no doubt there is a good deal in these chemicals!\r\nBut one should test them first!'\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we sate out in front of the little inn for a time with our\r\ncoffee. There was a good deal of coming and going, a tremendous\r\nclattering about of children in little wooden _sabots_, and much\r\ngood-natured 'chaff' between the people of the inn, who came out to\r\ntake the air after their day's work, and the passers-by. There seems to\r\nbe little in the peasants here of that positive _morgue_, not to say\r\narrogance, which marks the demeanour of their class in the western parts\r\nof France. There are regions in Brittany where the carriage of the\r\npeasants towards the 'bourgeois' gives reality and zest to the old story\r\nof the _ci-devant_ noble who called a particularly insolent varlet to\r\norder in the days of the first Revolution by saying to him: 'Nay,\r\nfriend, you will be good enough to remember that we are living in a\r\nrepublic, and that I am your equal!'\r\n\r\nThere was the most perfect civility and amiableness even in the\r\ninterchange of not very delicate pleasantries between the people at\r\nCoucy. 'Don't go too near the butcher's shop!' called out one of the\r\nostlers to a man with whom he had been talking as the latter drove off\r\nin his cart. 'Ah! you won't eat me, if I do,' the other replied; 'it\r\nwould cost you too much!' An old farmer who sate sipping his _petit\r\nverre_ near me, explained to me that the man was a resident of Barisis,\r\na little village not very far off, the dwellers in which from time\r\nimmemorial have been known as 'the pigs of Barisis.' 'Try and pick up a\r\nhusband on the way,' another of the stable lads called out after a\r\npretty girl who paused with a companion, as she went by the place, to\r\nchat with him--'try and pick up a husband on the way and we'll keep the\r\nwedding feast here!' 'Ah bah!' the damsel rejoined in a merry voice,\r\n'more marryers come your way than ours. Tie up the first one that comes\r\nand keep him for me!' This quickness to catch and return the ball\r\ncertainly shows a greater natural or acquired alertness of mind among\r\nthese Picard peasants than is commonly found in people of the same\r\ncondition in rural England.\r\n\r\nThe country all the way from Coucy to Laon is one continuous garden, and\r\nLaon itself is pre-eminently a city set on a hill. The Château de Coucy\r\nstands upon its pinnacle of rock, like a knight in armour, with folded\r\narms, looking loftily down upon the world, conscious of his strength,\r\nand calmly awaiting attack. The fortress-city of Laon, a fortress from\r\nthe earliest Roman days, looks out from the promontory on which it\r\nstands, over the wide expanse of plain beyond and around it, like an\r\nadvanced sentinel, watchful and alert.\r\n\r\nYou go up to it by long flights of steps, as in the case of so many\r\nhigh-perched Italian towns, and the fine winding carriage-way which has\r\nbeen constructed around the hill, commands, from beneath the beautiful\r\ntrees by which it is shaded, a series of the finest imaginable views. It\r\nhas suffered much, of course, from war, and not a little from the\r\nrevolutionists. But its magnificent cathedral and the ancient palace of\r\nthe bishop-dukes, now occupied by the courts of justice, have fared\r\nbetter than many other monuments. For some time past, however, the\r\ncathedral has been undergoing repairs, which is as much as to say that\r\nthe interior is practically hidden from the eye by a maze of scaffolds\r\nand hoardings and ladders. Mr. Ruskin somewhere complains, not wholly\r\nwithout reason, that 'the French are always doing something to their\r\ncathedrals,' and the complaint is in order now both as to Laon and as to\r\nNantes. No one can tell when the fine recumbent statue of Raoul de\r\nCoucy, who fell at Mansourah by the side of St.-Louis, will again be\r\nvisible at Laon, or the matchless tomb of the Duchesse Anne at Nantes.\r\n\r\nHere, as in the region around Chauny and Coucy, I was struck with the\r\nextreme good-nature and simplicity of the people. Through the narrow,\r\nold-fashioned streets went the town-crier with his bell, calling\r\n'Attention! attention! attention!' announcing an auction sale of\r\nfurniture after the old custom which existed in some old American towns\r\nquite down to the middle of the present century.\r\n\r\nThe people were at their trades in the street, as in the Italian towns,\r\nshoemakers hammering at their lasts, ironworkers banging and thumping\r\naway. When I had found the house of a gentleman whom I wished to see, in\r\nthe beautiful old cathedral close, and had rung in vain a dozen times at\r\nthe bell, a courteous passer-by paused, and asked me if I wished to find\r\nM.----. 'Eh!' he said, 'the house is shut up because he is in the\r\ncountry for the day. I think he will be here to-morrow; but if you will\r\ncome with me I will show you a little inn not far from here where I know\r\nyou will find his coachman, who can tell you exactly when he will\r\nreturn.'\r\n\r\nHow long would a stranger have to ring at the door of a house in an\r\nEnglish cathedral town before it would occur to anybody passing to stop\r\nand thus enlighten him?\r\n\r\nWith all their kindness and good-nature, however, the people of Laon are\r\nnot lukewarm in politics. I found a hairdresser, the local Figaro, a\r\nraging Boulangist. 'He had served in Tonkin; he had seen, with his own\r\neyes seen the soldiers robbed and starved and left to die. He had seen,\r\nwith his own eyes seen the Government people taking huge \"wine-pots\"\r\nfrom the natives. It was _infecte_! And the governor Richaud, whom they\r\ncalled back to France because he wished to expose the way in which his\r\npredecessor had taken thousands of francs and a diamond belt from the\r\nking of Cambodia, Norodom. I had surely heard of that?'\r\n\r\nI certainly had heard of that, for all France rang with the exposure\r\nmade of it in the Chamber of Deputies--that is to say, all France rang\r\nwith it for a couple of days.\r\n\r\n'Yes! that is true. Paris forgets everything in a day, and Monsieur is\r\nspeaking of Paris; but here in Laon we do not forget; Monsieur will see.\r\nWas it natural, I ask, Monsieur, that of all the people on board of the\r\nship which was bringing back M. Richaud to France--he, only he, and his\r\nvalet, his Chinese valet--I ask was it natural only they two should on\r\nthe ocean have the cholera, and die? Was it natural? And if they died\r\nwas that a reason why all the effects, all the papers--note that,\r\nMonsieur--all the papers of M. Richaud, the papers to prove that\r\ncorruption exists there in Tonkin, should be thrown overboard, all\r\nthrown into the sea? Yes! and on what pretext? To save the rest of the\r\nship from the cholera! Is it transparent, that? No! we must have\r\nBoulanger!'\r\n\r\n'The light must be let in; we must have the light!'\r\n\r\n'Were there many people of Figaro's mind in Laon and in the Department?'\r\n\r\n'If there are many? You will see, Monsieur; here in the Aisne we shall\r\nelect the greatest friend of General Boulanger. Monsieur does not know\r\nhim? M. Castelin--André Castelin. Ah! he is strong, Castelin! He was in\r\nAfrica with General Boulanger. He was there with the General when he put\r\nhis hand on that governor of Tunis, that Cambon, the brother, Monsieur\r\nknows, of that Cambon who was a deputy? Castelin saw the General at work\r\nin Tunis. He is with him, he will be with him in the new Chamber. We\r\nshall elect Castelin, and then--you will see!'\r\n\r\nMy notes of Figaro's very clear and positive talk in the summer are not\r\nwithout interest to me now when I revise them in the autumn. For Figaro\r\nprophesied truly, and the Department of the Aisne certainly did elect\r\nM. André Castelin to be one of its Deputies at Paris.\r\n\r\nAnother worthy citizen of Laon with whom I talked in his shop, a\r\nshoemaker, while much less confident than Figaro as to the results of\r\nthe elections, was quite as positive in his hostility to the Government.\r\nIt is the tendency of shoemakers all over the world, within my\r\nobservations, to be extreme Radicals. The shoemakers of Lynn in\r\nMassachusetts long ago were the advanced guard, I remember, of the\r\nAbolitionists. They were the strength of the 'Old Org.--' the 'old\r\norganisation'--enemies of slavery, as slavery, without compromise or\r\nhesitation. Every man of them was as ready as the Simple Cobbler of\r\nAgawam to tackle any problem, terrestrial or celestial, at a moment's\r\nnotice. It was idle to cite _ne sutor_ to them in matters of art or of\r\npolitics, of science or of theology. My shoemaker of Laon was less of a\r\nfanatic, but not less of a philosopher, than his brethren of Lynn. He\r\nwas opposed to the Republic, but he was equally opposed to the monarchy.\r\nHe had his idea; it was that government must be abolished, and the\r\naffairs of the country carried on by committees of experts. He liked the\r\nlaw authorising professional syndicates; there he thought was the germ\r\nof the true system. The professional syndicates should nominate the\r\nexperts, each syndicate the experts in its own business. These should\r\nmeet, settle the general necessary budget, recommend measures. Then the\r\npeople, in their communes, should act upon all this. It was his system.\r\nIt would be long to develop. He was not a man to write or to speak, but\r\nhe thought.\r\n\r\nAs to the present situation he bitterly condemned the Exposition. It was\r\na mistake, for it brought all the world to see the progress of France\r\nand to steal the French ideas. It also took too many people to Paris;\r\nthat was good for the railways. But Proudhon long ago was right; the\r\nrailways were the new feudal system; they were the enemy more than\r\nclericalism. Then see to what corruption this Exposition led. Had I not\r\nseen the votes, the credits given to the Ministers for entertaining?\r\n'Ah! it was monstrous!' With this he drew a paper out of his pocket; he\r\nhad it all there, with the dates and the figures. 'Observe, Monsieur,\r\nhere, on April 6, the Chamber votes one million of francs--yes, one\r\nmillion of francs to be allowed for dinners, for balls, for punches, for\r\nI know not what, to the Ministers--only to the Ministers! How many are\r\nthey? Ten! Yes! one hundred thousand francs to each of them for eating\r\nand drinking during the famous Exposition! Only there are some who get\r\nmore, some who get less. That little watchmaker Tirard, they give him\r\n250,000 francs! Did he ever earn 250,000 francs in his life? Never! and\r\nwill they spend all this money on dinners and punches? No, never in\r\nlife! It is just simply to pocket a million of the money of the people!'\r\n\r\nThat the political contest will be sharp in Laon I am assured by a\r\nfriend who is thoroughly familiar with the whole machinery of politics\r\nin this department of the Aisne. Laon, it seems, is the true\r\nheadquarters of the freemasonry of this department, and in the Aisne, to\r\nuse his language, 'the freemasons are the Government.' 'I mean this,' he\r\nsaid, 'in a more extensive sense than you may, perhaps, be disposed to\r\naccept. You will find, I think, if the Government secures a majority in\r\nthe next Chamber, that the Aisne will have a good deal to say in the\r\norganisation of the Chamber. Then, perhaps, you will understand the true\r\nmeaning of that letter of M. Allain-Targé, of which you heard at Chauny.\r\nThere is a pretty comedy under it, for M. Allain-Targé, remember, is a\r\nfreemason!\r\n\r\n'It would be very amusing, but we taxpayers have to pay too much for the\r\nplay. What you were told at Chauny about the freemasons in the\r\ndepartment was quite true. Only you did not get the whole of the truth.\r\nLook at the press of the department! You saw at Chauny the building of\r\nthe local journal there, _La Défense Nationale_'?\r\n\r\nCertainly I had seen it, for it is the most conspicuous and the newest\r\nedifice in the main street of Chauny, and so glorious with golden\r\nletters that I took it for a great insurance office.\r\n\r\n'Very well; that journal is under the control of a Brother of the Order,\r\na hatter at Chauny, M. Bugnicourt. Here, at Laon, the _Tribune_, the\r\nchief Republican organ of the department, is entirely in the hands of\r\nthe Order. The chairman of the publishing company is Brother Dupuy. Go\r\non towards Hirson by the railway and you will come to the busy little\r\ntown of Vervins. Brother Dupuy sits in the Chamber of Deputies for\r\nVervins, and at Vervins Brother Dupuy owns and prints another journal,\r\n_Le Libéral de Vervins_. The political director of the _Tribune_ here at\r\nLaon is Brother Doumer. Brother Doumer, as you know, is also a Deputy!\r\nAnd how did he become a Deputy? Let me tell you. It is an instructive\r\nstory, and you will find M. Allain-Targé at work in it--that excellent\r\nman who will not make promises to the electors which he cannot keep.'\r\n\r\n'In the winter of 1888, M. Ringuier, a Deputy from the second\r\ncircumscription of Laon, unexpectedly died. The Order at once determined\r\nto capture his seat. With Brother Allain-Targé as Prefect, what could be\r\neasier? M. Allain-Targé hastened the new election almost indecently.\r\nHardly a fortnight after the death of M. Ringuier, early in March 1888,\r\nthe Brethren came up from all quarters to Laon, and it was announced\r\nthat Brother Doumer had received the orthodox Republican nomination. Of\r\ncourse, with the préfecture and the freemason press of Laon, Chauny,\r\nSoissons, Château Thierry, Vervins, behind him, Doumer was elected. This\r\nyear he will find it harder work, for all the opposition will be\r\nconcentrated in support of Castelin, the friend of Boulanger. Brother\r\nAllain-Targé is no longer prefect, but his secretary, another Brother,\r\nHuc (no kinsman of the famous Abbé), is sub-prefect at Soissons, and the\r\nBrethren all over the department help each other in every\r\ncircumscription. They are very strong among the Revenue officers, and\r\nthat, as you will easily understand, gives them and the Order generally\r\na very important invisible leverage! I could tell you now of a Brother\r\nat Soissons whom they mean to put into the Chamber. They knew his money\r\nvalue; they have got him into their shop. He is as stupid as he is\r\nrich--just as fit to be a deputy as to command the garrison of Paris.\r\nBut they will get him nominated, and then the Government will get him\r\nelected, and then he will do the bidding of Brother Doumer and the\r\nothers, to help them to put pressure on the ministers and on the\r\nPresident, and be helped by them to recoup himself, in one way or\r\nanother, for all the cash advances he will make before he is elected.'\r\n\r\nLaon sends two deputies to the Chamber. My friend's opinion in August\r\nwas that the Opposition now control the city, and that both of these\r\nseats would be carried against the Government. The event proved that he\r\nwas right. He was right, too, as to the outlook at Château Thierry, the\r\ncharming birthplace of La Fontaine, on the road to Epernay. There he\r\nexpected to see the Republican candidate who sat in the late Chamber, M.\r\nLesguillier, hold his seat against the monarchical candidate, M. de\r\nMandat-Grancey, the author of a well-known and interesting book on\r\nIreland, _Chez Paddy_. M. de Mandat-Grancey is a landed proprietor who\r\nhas taken an active and successful part in promoting the improvement of\r\nthe breed of horses in this country. He is a man of liberal ideas as\r\nwell as a man of enterprise, and in the present agricultural 'crisis,'\r\nof which one hears so much in France, such men would certainly be of use\r\nin the Chamber. But at Château Thierry, according to my friend,\r\n'everything is organised by the freemasons. They control a journal\r\nthere, the _Avenir de l'Aisne_. The mayor, M. Morlot, is a freemason.\r\nAnother freemason, an ex-deputy, M. Deville, wields great influence\r\nthere. You will see that the recent deputy, who is an insignificant\r\nperson, will be re-elected, and that M. de Mandat-Grancey, who would be\r\nof use, will be beaten.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps because he is an avowed monarchist,' I replied, 'and the people\r\nmay be Republicans,'\r\n\r\nMy friend looked at me for a moment. 'Are you speaking seriously?'\r\n\r\nOf course I was.\r\n\r\n'Well, then, that astonishes me! Can you possibly suppose, after all you\r\nhave seen and known of France, that the people in a place like Château\r\nThierry are such simpletons as to believe that it makes the slightest\r\ndifference what name you give to a government? They leave that sort of\r\nthing to the journalists and the village actors! They have long memories\r\nin the provinces! And they judge governments, not at all by their names,\r\nbut by their men. They know the functionaries by heart. \"Not much of a\r\ngovernment,\" they say to one another, \"that sends us so and so!\"\r\n\r\n'In this region the Empire is still very popular, thanks mainly to this.\r\nNo! outside of the influence of the freemasons, which will be exerted\r\nagainst him through the pressure put upon the friends and families of\r\nthe small army of government employés, and will therefore be formidable,\r\nwhat M. de Mandat-Grancey will have most to fear will be not the\r\npreference of the people for the Republic--for that, I tell you, does\r\nnot exist--but the indiscreet zeal of some of the clergy in his behalf.\r\n\r\n'It is natural the clergy should wish to be rid of this persecuting gang\r\nat Paris, and of these disgusting freemasons--quite natural. But they do\r\nnot always remember one peculiarity of our peasants. There is a great\r\nlove for the _culte_ here among our people--a very great love for it;\r\nbut they do not like to be meddled with in politics by the curés or the\r\npriests. They will vote for the curé if the curé lets them alone. But if\r\nhe bothers them about it they are much more likely to vote against him.\r\n\r\n'If Constans knows his business he will tell that freemason Thévenot,\r\nthe Keeper of the Seals, to let the curés and the clergy do all they\r\nfeel disposed to do in politics. Pardie, I am not sure he has not\r\nalready been suborning some of our curés to go into a conservative\r\npropaganda!'\r\n\r\n'This is my great fear,' he added presently, 'for Soissons in September.\r\nWe ought to carry that seat. The freemasons mean to make the Republicans\r\naccept a most absurd candidate there, as I have told you, and if we can\r\nonly keep some of our clerical friends quiet, we shall beat him. But we\r\nshall see! If the curés hurt us sometimes by their over-zeal, on the\r\nother hand the Republican deputies and functionaries help us by making\r\nthe Republic disreputable in the eyes of serious people, and that in all\r\nclasses of society.\r\n\r\n'Look at the working-men, for example, here in Laon. There are a good\r\nmany of them who know M. Doumer much better since he became a deputy\r\nthan they knew him when he was first a candidate!\r\n\r\n'The question of the Sociétés Ouvrières is a question which means a good\r\ndeal for the working-men. M. Doumer would have been well advised had he\r\nlet it alone. But no! M. Doumer gets himself appointed to draw up a\r\nReport of the Chamber of Deputies on this question, with a Project of a\r\nLaw to supersede, modify, extend the Law of 1867, under which\r\nco-operative societies have so far grown up in France.\r\n\r\n'The Report and the Project, as finally edited by the aspiring deputy\r\nfor Laon, a freemason as I have told you, are to be printed by another\r\nfreemason, the worthy hatter, M. Bugnicourt, at Chauny, who is the chief\r\npersonage of the _Défense Nationale_, and all the voters are to see how\r\nBrother Doumer devotes himself to the interests of the working classes,\r\nat Paris, while other deputies go about amusing themselves with the\r\n_danseuses du ventre_, and the other marvels of the Exposition.\r\n\r\n'This is all very well.\r\n\r\n'But Brother Doumer, in his desire to pose before the voters of the\r\nAisne as the heaven-born deputy in whom the working-man may put his\r\ntrust, takes the trouble to make it quite clear that the Republic has\r\ndone absolutely nothing but appoint committees to sit upon \"the great\r\nquestion\" of co-operation among the working classes!\r\n\r\n'Brother Doumer, as I have told you, was made a deputy in 1888. After\r\ntaking his seat he was made a member of the Committee which has been\r\nconducting an \"extra-parliamentary enquiry\" on the subject of\r\nco-operative societies among working-men for work and for production,\r\nand with the question of contracts between employers and working-men\r\nfor participation in the profits of industrial enterprises.\r\n\r\n'This committee, he says in his Report, took the matter in hand in 1883,\r\nand spent _five years_ over it, getting its project of a law on these\r\nsubjects into shape only in 1888, on the eve of the election of a new\r\nChamber of Deputies!\r\n\r\n'During these five long years, according to Brother Doumer, the Republic\r\nwas content to let co-operation among working-men take its chances under\r\na law passed in 1867, under the Second Empire. And yet, according still\r\nto Brother Doumer, the idea of co-operation among the working classes\r\nwas an exclusively French idea, and not only an exclusively French idea,\r\nbut an idea which came to birth only under the Republic of 1848 (he\r\nglides silently over the famous experiment of the National workshops of\r\n1848). Is it not really remarkable that the Republicans of 1879 should\r\nhave been willing to leave this \"beautiful and generous\" idea at the\r\nmercy of a law passed by the Empire, and which--still according to\r\nBrother Doumer--left the co-operative societies of working-men without\r\nprivileges, without favour, and with no particular facilities for\r\nconstituting themselves and for keeping themselves alive?\r\n\r\n'I say the \"Republicans of 1879\" advisedly, for you will see, if you\r\nlook at page 5 of this delightful Report, that--still according to\r\nBrother Doumer--we really had no republic, in fact, in France till 1879.\r\nThese are his own words; \"the Republic, having been reconstituted,\r\n(after the fall of the Empire) _first in name_, and afterwards in fact,\r\na new impulse was given to co-operation. The ill-will towards all\r\nsocieties of working-men of the Governments of May 21 and of May 16,\r\nretarded the movement. It was only in 1879 that, the wounds of the\r\ncountry having been healed and liberty reconquered, we had leisure to\r\noccupy ourselves with the question of the organisation of labour.\"\r\n\r\n'Is not this charming? Really, when one remembers what the \"wounds of\r\nthe country\" were in 1871, and how those \"wounds\" were got first through\r\nthe collapse of the wretched Government of the National Defence, and\r\nthen through the Commune of Paris, the Governments of May 21 and May 16\r\nmay be credited with having done a good piece of work by \"healing those\r\nwounds\" and by \"reconquering liberty.\" Is not this plain?\r\n\r\n'But the \"wounds having been healed,\" and \"liberty having been\r\nreconquered,\" the true Republic, still according to Brother Doumer, was\r\nset free in 1879, to occupy itself with the question of the organisation\r\nof labour. Very good.\r\n\r\n'1879! that is ten years ago! And only in 1888 do we find the Republic\r\nreally occupying itself, in the person of Brother Doumer, with this\r\ngreat question, this beautiful and generous idea! How very odd! And what\r\na strange coincidence that Brother Doumer, elected a deputy by the grace\r\nof the freemasons in 1888, and wishing to be re-elected a deputy by\r\ntheir grace in 1889, should be the man of destiny called upon to solve\r\nthis great question!\r\n\r\n'He makes this perfectly plain!\r\n\r\n'Two Ministers of Public Works, M. de Freycinet and M. Sadi Carnot,' he\r\nblandly observes, 'studied measures which might be taken in view of\r\nfacilitating the concession to societies of working-men of certain\r\npublic works!\r\n\r\n'Ah! This is hard upon M. de Freycinet and M. Sadi Carnot, now President\r\nof the ideal Republic! They \"studied,\" did they, \"measures which might\r\nbe taken\"! But they never took any such measures! Oh, no! not they!'\r\n\r\n'So the first year of the \"true Republic\" went by, and still\r\nco-operation languished under the Imperial law of 1867. Then in 1880\r\ncame M. de Lacretelle, who \"presented to the Chambers a proposed law\r\ntending\" to the same end which M. de Freycinet and M. Sadi Carnot had so\r\nunprofitably \"studied\"! Of course the Chamber eagerly adopted it? Not at\r\nall! It was never discussed!\r\n\r\n'Two years thrown away by the true Republic!\r\n\r\n'Then in 1881 M. Floquet (now the favourite candidate of Brother Doumer\r\nfor the Presidency of the Chamber if the Republicans carry the elections\r\nof 1889), being made Prefect of the Seine, had a great impulse! \"He\r\nwished to revive the decree of 1848 as to that department.\" Excellent\r\nman! But he did not in fact revive it! He did what he could. He\r\n\"appointed a Committee to study the question!\" And this studious\r\nCommittee eventually evolved--what? \"A new schedule of prices for the\r\npublic works of the City of Paris, which favoured co-operative societies\r\nand contractors whose workmen were to participate in their profits!\"\r\n\r\n'So the fourth year of the true Republic began, and found the \"beautiful\r\nand generous idea\" still prostrate under the Imperial law of 1867!\r\n\r\n'In 1882, still according to Brother Doumer, two deputies, M. Ballue\r\nbacked by several colleagues, and M. Laroche-Joubert heroically rushed\r\nbefore the Chamber, each with a proposed law \"tending\" (how all these\r\nlaws \"tend\"!) to make it obligatory upon all contractors for public\r\nworks to give their workmen a share in their profits! But the Chamber\r\npaid no heed, and the fourth year of the true Republic ended, leaving\r\nthe \"beautiful and generous idea\" still under the iron heel of the\r\nImperial law of 1867!\r\n\r\n'Then came March 20, 1883, and the Minister of the Interior rose at last\r\nto the height of his mission. He took it upon himself to issue a\r\ndecree--instituting what? An extra-parliamentary committee to \"study\"\r\nthe question of working-men's associations, and if, and how, they should\r\nbe admitted to take part in the public works of the State!'\r\n\r\n'Bravo!'\r\n\r\n'And the committee was appointed. It consisted' (it is still Brother\r\nDoumer who speaks) \"of directors and high functionaries of all the\r\nministerial departments.\" It went to work. It heard \"a great number of\r\nwitnesses.\" It also showed conclusively \"how complex was the question,\r\n_and how urgent the necessity of a solution_.\"'\r\n\r\n'What then happened?'\r\n\r\n'The committee immediately went to sleep!\r\n\r\n'\"_After an interruption_ of more than a year\" (it is still Brother\r\nDoumer who speaks), \"_the extra-parliamentary committee resumed its\r\nsittings, on January_ 16, 1885!\"\r\n\r\n'Six years of the true Republic having now been spent in these desperate\r\nefforts to deal with the \"beautiful and generous idea,\" and the election\r\nof a new Chamber being imminent for the autumn of 1885, M.\r\nWaldeck-Rousseau, Minister of the Interior, proceeded to lay before the\r\nre-awakened committee--what? A project of a law to relieve the\r\nco-operative idea from the crushing weight of the Imperial law of 1867?\r\nNot a bit of it!\r\n\r\n'He proceeded (it is still Brother Doumer who speaks!) to lay before the\r\nCommittee \"_a summary of the studies upon which it ought to enter_!\"\r\n\r\n'According to Brother Doumer this \"summary\" was truly grand and even\r\n\"vast.\" But alas! \"the general elections,\" says Brother Doumer, sadly,\r\n\"and afterwards successive ministerial crises, _suspended the inquiry\r\nduring more than two years_! It was only in 1888 that the\r\nextra-parliamentary committee resumed its labours!\"\r\n\r\n'The Universal Exposition of 1889 was then organising and\r\norganising--let me ask you not for a moment to forget--with a specific\r\neye, not so much to the \"principles of 1789,\" about which our worthy\r\nministers care as much as they do about the Edict of Nantes or the\r\nphilosophy of Pascal, as to the Legislative elections of 1889!\r\n\r\n'So what did the extra-parliamentary committee do in this _ninth year_\r\nof the one \"true Republic\" for the \"beautiful and generous idea\" of\r\nco-operation?\r\n\r\n'They adopted a decree--\"a firm and practical decree\"--promulgated June\r\n6, 1888, \"permitting several co-operative societies to contract for\r\npublic works, especially in connection with the Exposition\"! and they\r\nalso adopted \"two projects of laws\"!\r\n\r\n'\"The first of these projects\" (it is still Brother Doumer who speaks),\r\n\"aimed at the creation of a general provident fund, industrial,\r\ncommercial, and agricultural, to be managed by the 'Caisse des Dépôts et\r\nConsignations.'\"\r\n\r\n'\"This very interesting project,\" says Brother Doumer, \"_has not yet\r\nbeen submitted to the Chamber_. Sent up to be examined by the Ministry\r\nof the Interior to the Ministry of Commerce, it is there undergoing _a\r\nprolonged and inexplicable delay_!\"\r\n\r\n'No! no! Brother Doumer! \"prolonged\" if you like, but not\r\n\"inexplicable!\"\r\n\r\n'And so, after now _ten years_, we have the true Republic which got\r\ncomplete possession in 1879 of all the machinery for giving force and\r\neffect to the \"beautiful and generous\" idea of co-operation, and for\r\ngiving wings to that idea, leaving it still under the blighting curse of\r\nthe Imperial law of 1867.\r\n\r\n'And Doumer alone! Brother Doumer, whom Providence and the freemasons of\r\nLaon sent to the Chamber in 1888, has met the questions which have been\r\n\"urgent\" ever since 1848 with the grand practical solution of a \"report\"\r\nfifteen pages long, and of a \"project of law\" consisting of six titles\r\nand about a hundred clauses!\r\n\r\n'Take this pamphlet with you,' said my friend, after going over it with\r\nme; 'take it, look into it minutely, and tell me if anything you have\r\never heard or read in the way of our Conservative attacks upon the\r\nflatulence, the fatuity, and the hypocrisy of these pretended friends of\r\nlabour and of the working-man is to be compared, for cold-blooded\r\ncruelty, with this exposition made by Brother Doumer of the methods of\r\nhis party.\r\n\r\n'I don't know,' he added, 'what portfolio Brother Doumer expects to get\r\nif the Government carry these elections of 1889. He has kicked M. de\r\nFreycinet, as you see, into one corner, and President Carnot into\r\nanother, for the benefit of his friend and ally, M. Floquet, so I\r\nsuppose he expects to secure some commanding position, neither M. de\r\nFreycinet nor President Carnot being strong enough to resent the\r\nimpertinences of an eminent freemason. But wherever they put him, this\r\nwonderful Report of his ought to be printed and circulated freely all\r\nover France by the Conservative committees. It is the most concise and\r\neloquent history, that I know, of ten years of the true Republic in its\r\nrelation to the working classes of France. You have seen at St.-Gobain\r\nthe results of a co-operative association of working-men organized under\r\nstatutes drawn up by a practical and liberal friend of labour, M.\r\nCochin, in 1866, a year before the Imperial law of 1867 was passed.\r\n\r\n'Wherever elsewhere in France you find the principle of co-operation\r\nadopted and bearing fruit for the benefit of working-men, pray remember\r\nthat the \"true Republic\" has for ten years persistently evaded and\r\ndodged the problems with which the Empire grappled, and to which the\r\nEmperor gave a practical answer nearly a quarter of a century ago!'\r\n\r\nAfter following my friend carefully through his amusing and instructive\r\nvivisection of the Report presented to the late Chamber by the masonic\r\nmember for Laon upon the project of law touching co-operation proposed\r\nby M. Floquet, I was not surprised, of course, to learn that the\r\n'project' still remains a 'project.' It was adopted in what is called a\r\n'Friday session' by the Chamber, and then sent up to die a natural death\r\nin the Senate--the Senate, be it remembered, being the absolute\r\nstronghold of the existing Republican Government.\r\n\r\nSo that still, after ten years of power, the Republicans of M. Doumer's\r\n'true Republic' leave the working-men of France, so far as co-operation\r\ncan affect their interests, under the control of a law passed under the\r\nEmpire more than twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nClearly one of two things must be true: either this law, passed under\r\nthe Empire more than twenty years ago, is a good and sufficient law,\r\nassuring to the working-men of France all the advantages, and protecting\r\nthem against all the disadvantages, incident to the principle of\r\nco-operation, so far as this influence and this protection can be given\r\nby laws; or the Republicans of M. Doumer's 'true Republic' have been\r\nhumbugging and trifling with the working-men of France on the subject\r\never since they contrived, ten years ago, to get the control of power at\r\nParis. Upon one horn or the other of this dilemma, the 'true\r\nRepublicans' clearly must elect to take their seats.\r\n\r\nThe voters of Laon would appear to be of the mind that the 'true\r\nRepublicans' of M. Doumer have been humbugging and trifling with them.\r\nFor at the election of this year, M. Doumer lost his seat, and the\r\ncandidate favoured by my Boulangist Figaro at Laon, M. Castelin, was\r\nelected. What followed is worth noting, to complete this picture of the\r\nworking of representative institutions in one of the great French\r\nprovinces under the Third Republic.\r\n\r\nM. Doumer, in his address to the electors of the Aisne, issued at Laon\r\non August 15, 1889, was at great pains to explain what his own relations\r\nhad been with Boulangism and with General Boulanger in 1888, before he\r\nbecame a deputy from Laon in the place of M. Ringuier.\r\n\r\n'I frankly admit,' he observes in this very curious document, 'that I\r\nfelt a lively sympathy with General Boulanger _while he was Minister of\r\nWar_!... In the journal which I conducted I insisted on his being put\r\nback into the Cabinet, on the fall of the Goblet Ministry.'\r\n\r\nWhen, by the death of M. Ringuier in the early spring of 1888, a seat\r\nfrom the Aisne was suddenly vacated, the freemasons of Laon, as I have\r\nstated, selected M. Doumer as the Republican candidate to fill it. M.\r\nDoumer's friend, M. Floquet, was not then at the head of the Government,\r\nand General Boulanger was still in command of his army-corps at\r\nClermont, coming up to Paris, as the Government affirmed, disguised and\r\nwearing blue spectacles, to organise political mischief, and generally\r\nmaking himself a terror and a trouble to the 'true Republicans,' who had\r\nmade a great man of him for their own purposes.\r\n\r\n'Eight days before the election, which was fixed for March 25, 1888,'\r\nsays M. Doumer, in his address of this year to the voters, \"I had no\r\ncompetitor, and my election seemed to be certain.\"'\r\n\r\nNo doubt. The 'Brethren' had arranged everything.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the skies darkened! The Government of M. Tirard plucked up\r\ncourage to make head against the 'brav' Général.' General Boulanger was\r\nrelieved of his command at Clermont.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Boulangists resolved to avail themselves of the\r\nimpending election at Laon as an opportunity of responding to the attack\r\nof the Government by a demonstration of their strength in the provinces;\r\nand M. Doumer was suddenly served with a notice that the seat of which\r\nhe had felt so sure would be wanted for General Boulanger!\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel and a critical moment. What was to be done? To withdraw\r\nfrom the contest was to take sides virtually with General Boulanger\r\nagainst the Tirard Government, and much as M. Floquet and the friends of\r\nM. Doumer disliked M. Tirard, they were not ready to throw in their lot\r\nat that moment against him. So the Brethren, as my friend believes, were\r\ncalled upon to bring about an arrangement. What General Boulanger wanted\r\nwas not to fill the seat for Laon; it was only to be elected to fill the\r\nseat for Laon. Plainly, therefore, the course of practical wisdom, for\r\nM. Doumer was to come to an understanding with the friends of General\r\nBoulanger. So this was done.\r\n\r\nThe Parisian Committee of the General came into the Aisne, and at a\r\nconference, which M. Doumer admits that he held with them at Tergnier,\r\nit was agreed that after the first balloting, on March 31, 'the voters\r\nwho then voted for General Boulanger as a protest, should vote for M.\r\nDoumer at the second balloting, and so elect him.'\r\n\r\nThe first balloting came off in due course of time. Both M. Doumer, the\r\nRepublican candidate, and M. Jacquemont, the Conservative candidate,\r\nwere left in the rear by General Boulanger, who received some forty\r\nthousand votes--the election being held in 1888 under the _scrutin de\r\nliste_ adopted, before the elections of 1885, by the Republicans, in\r\norder to remedy what they had denounced as the 'intolerable' evils of\r\nthe _scrutin d'arrondissement_. Under the stress of the Boulangist\r\npanic, these same Republicans suddenly threw the _scrutin de liste_ over\r\nagain in 1889, to readopt and reimpose upon their beloved country the\r\n'intolerable' evils of the _scrutin d'arrondissement_!\r\n\r\nThe second balloting was to take place on March 31. Suppose that General\r\nBoulanger should take it into his head to force the fighting on that day\r\nat Laon--worse still, try to make an 'arrangement' with the Conservative\r\ncandidate? What would then become of M. Doumer? So, on March 28, M.\r\nDoumer tells us he went up to Paris, from Laon in company with the\r\nchairman of one of the Republican committees, and there had an interview\r\nwith a leading member of the committee of General Boulanger, the result\r\nof which was that the 'brav' Général' published a letter, in which he\r\nannounced to the electors of the Aisne that he could not accept a seat\r\nwhich he could only occupy to the detriment of competitors 'beside whom,\r\nand not against whom, he had allowed himself to be made a candidate.' He\r\nwound up by requesting his friends in the Aisne 'to vote at the second\r\nballoting for the candidate who would best support the honour of the\r\ncountry and the interests of the Republic.'\r\n\r\nThen came, at Laon, a meeting of the Republican Committee of the Aisne,\r\nat which the chairman of the meeting, M. Lesguillier, was instructed to\r\ndo his best to 'dissipate the somewhat equivocal effect' of the\r\nlanguage used by General Boulanger in his letter, and to induce the\r\nBoulangist committee to work, on the 31st, for the election of M.\r\nDoumer. And so, on March 31, 1888, M. Doumer was finally put into the\r\nseat, which enabled him to draw up his model report on the great\r\nquestion of 'co-operation.' That the Boulangists of Laon are not wholly\r\ndelighted with the course of M. Doumer in the late Chamber, and that the\r\nworking-men of Laon are not deeply impressed by the value to them of his\r\nmodel report on 'co-operation,' may be inferred from his defeat by the\r\nBoulangist candidate M. Castelin under the _scrutin d'arrondissement_ in\r\nSeptember, 1889.\r\n\r\nBut M. Doumer is a typical French politician of the Third Republic, and\r\nas his alliance with M. Floquet seems to be firmer than ever, my friend\r\nin the Aisne is probably right in thinking that M. Doumer will still be\r\nheard of perhaps as a prefect, perhaps as a deputy filling the seat of\r\nsome 'invalidated' deputy from Paris, perhaps as a Trésorier-Général,\r\noccupying one of the large number (I think there are eighty in all) of\r\nthese lucrative posts, which it has been the custom of successive\r\nadministrations under the Third Republic to distribute among their\r\nfriends and supporters on retiring from power, as in England premiers,\r\nin like circumstances, distribute peerages and baronetcies and accolades\r\nof knighthood, one special difference between the two systems being that\r\nthe rewards of political service bestowed in England not only entail no\r\nexpense upon the taxpayers, but actually, I believe, bring a certain\r\namount in the way of fees into the Treasury, whereas in France such\r\nrewards mean a steady increase of the public outlay.\r\n\r\nAs the late parliament on the very last day of its existence adopted a\r\nplan proposed by M. Doumer himself for re-organising the system of\r\n_Trésoriers-Généraux_, and making these officers regular members of the\r\nstaff of the Finance Ministry with fixed salaries, my friend in the\r\nAisne thinks it likely enough that one of these posts may fill the\r\neventual perspective of M. Doumer's political career.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the defeated candidate for Laon has been comfortably lodged,\r\nat the public cost, in the Legislative Palace, as Secretary of the\r\nPresident of the Chamber, M. Floquet being President, and receives a\r\nsalary of 15,000 francs, with perquisites and other advantages.\r\n\r\nWe do this sort of thing occasionally in the United States, for the\r\nbenefit of defeated political candidates. But in one important respect\r\nthe professional politician in France is better off than the\r\nprofessional politician in America. Our pension list is by far the\r\nlargest in the world, but we do not offer any prospect of a pension to\r\ncivil servants.\r\n\r\nNor have we so many paid legislative berths in which to lodge our\r\nprofessional politicians. The parliamentary business of the sixty\r\nmillions of people who now inhabit the United States is done by\r\neighty-four senators and 330 representatives, who receive something over\r\n$2,000,000 a year. The parliamentary business of less than forty\r\nmillions of people inhabiting France is supposed to require the services\r\nof 300 senators and 578 deputies, who receive for doing it 11,937,940\r\nfrancs, or, in round numbers, about $2,587,560. Whether the 878 French\r\nlegislators really earn half a million of dollars more by their annual\r\nlabours than do the 414 American legislators is a question which I leave\r\nmy readers to settle after they shall have settled the previous\r\nquestion, whether either of those considerable sums of money is really\r\nearned by either body. But there can be no doubt, I think, that, under\r\nthe existing economical conditions of society in the two republics, the\r\naggregate number of professional politicians aiming at the 878 prizes of\r\nthe profession in France is likely to be considerably in excess of the\r\naggregate number of professional politicians aiming at the 414 prizes of\r\nthe profession in the United States. Of course, too, this increase in\r\nthe aggregate number of the competitors must necessarily be attended by\r\na decline in the average standard of character and capacity among them:\r\nand as it is the settled policy of the French Republicans of the 'true\r\nRepublic,' who have been in power for the past decade, to exclude all\r\npersons not of their party from any share in the general administration\r\nof the Republic, it is obvious that this lowering of the level of\r\ncharacter and of capacity must be most marked among the professional\r\npoliticians of the Republican party. This is a matter of scientific\r\nnecessity, and not at all of sentiment; and it suffices to account for\r\nthe unquestionable average inferiority of the Government members of the\r\nSenate and the Chamber to the Opposition members in point both of\r\ncharacter and of capacity.\r\n\r\nThe intense centralisation of power in France is another and a very\r\nimportant force working in the same direction. Outside of the Federal\r\nfield of political ambition in the United States we have the State\r\ngovernments. But there can be no more than forty-two State governors in\r\nthe United States, whereas in France there are eighty-six prefects, and\r\nthree in Algiers, without counting the administrative authorities in the\r\nRegency of Tunis and in the French colonies. The governorships of the\r\nAmerican States are elective offices, to be won only by local services\r\nand local combinations. But the administrative prizes of French politics\r\ncan only be secured through the central administration at Paris, under\r\npressure from the all-powerful cliques and combinations in the National\r\nLegislature. Briefly, therefore, it seems to me quite clear that under\r\nthe Third Republic in France the profession of politics is rapidly\r\nbecoming, if it has not already become, much more easy of access, and,\r\nin proportion to the capital of character and of ability required for\r\nentering upon it, much more remunerative, than it has ever yet been in\r\nthe United States, unless perhaps during the domination of Mr. Tweed and\r\nthe Tammany Ring over the taxpayers of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nIN THE NORD\r\n\r\n\r\n  VALENCIENNES\r\n\r\nIt says but little for what Texans call the 'sabe' of the municipal\r\nauthorities of Valenciennes that this, which ought to be one of the most\r\npicturesque and attractive, is really one of the shabbiest historic\r\ntowns of North-eastern France. The streets are ill-paved and ill-kept,\r\nthe public buildings are untidy, and the whole place contrasts most\r\nunfavourably, from this point of view, with the rich and beautifully\r\ncultivated region through which you reach it by the railway from Douai.\r\nThis is the finest agricultural region in France--the old French\r\nFlanders, a 'fat' country as well as a flat. You hardly see a weed\r\nbetween Douai and Valenciennes. Great fields of beetroot are cultivated\r\nlike flower-gardens, and the green and growing crops are as daintily\r\nordered as the coils and plateaux of flowers with which it is the\r\nfashion to adorn dinner-tables _à la Russe_. It is not pleasant to be\r\nassured that the industrious dwellers in this land of Goshen are as fond\r\nof cock-fighting as the Spaniards, who probably enough introduced the\r\namusement here during their long domination over what is now known as\r\nFrench Flanders, and that they are addicted also in a systematic way to\r\nthe abominable practice of blinding bullfinches to make them better\r\nsingers. I am told that in many communes the authorities actually give\r\nprizes for the best singing birds thus produced, and that 'blind\r\nbullfinch societies' are among the many associations regularly\r\nestablished and nourishing among the fields and villages. The old\r\nFlemish love of strong drink also survives here, as is shown by the\r\nnumber and the prosperous appearance of the cabarets.\r\n\r\nThese average, for the whole Department of the Nord, no fewer than one\r\nto every sixty-six inhabitants, and around Valenciennes, the proportion\r\nrises as high as one to every forty-four. There is much subdivision of\r\nproperty, but it has not been pushed so far around Valenciennes as in\r\nsome other portions of the department, a majority of the small\r\nproperties extending to twenty-five hectares, and properties of from one\r\nhundred to three hundred hectares being considered large estates.\r\n\r\nThanks to the energy and intelligence of many considerable landholders,\r\na great improvement has taken place of late years in the agricultural\r\nmethods and instruments in use throughout this department: the open\r\ndrains have practically disappeared, the country has become more\r\nwholesome, as well as more fertile, and the farmers in general are\r\nadmittedly much better off, despite the crisis. This increasing\r\nprosperity is given as an explanation of the decreasing average number\r\nof children.\r\n\r\nBut French Flanders is nevertheless one of the densely populated parts\r\nof France, showing a population of 267 to the square league. It is\r\nproper to say, however, that this is chiefly due to the growth of\r\ncertain great manufacturing centres. In the rural regions the population\r\nis much less dense, and the population of Valenciennes is actually\r\ndeclining. It fell from 23,291 in 1881 to 22,919 in 1886. The\r\nexplanation is that people are moving out from Valenciennes into the new\r\nsuburbs. Anzin, Thiers, Denain, and St.-Amand are increasing with the\r\ndevelopment of the manufactories which are growing up here around the\r\ngreat coal-fields.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Valenciennes, there was a terrible commotion in the Paris\r\nnewspapers over a certain colonel in the army, who, being in the service\r\nof a well-known arms factory, loudly protested against the alleged sale\r\nof that factory to the Germans, and the threatened consequent closing of\r\nits works near Paris.\r\n\r\nAfter much journalistic and parliamentary gunpowder had been burned, it\r\ncame to light that the proprietors were simply making up their minds to\r\ntransfer their works to the vicinity of Valenciennes as a necessary\r\nmeasure of economy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the slovenly 'edility' of Valenciennes, I found it a\r\nvery interesting place. The Hôtel du Commerce there is a very well-kept\r\nold-fashioned hostelry, installed in a stately and spacious house, long\r\nthe residence of a considerable family. Indeed, one of my friends in\r\nValenciennes was quite severe in his comments upon the indifference of\r\nthe head of this family, still a man of large property, to this\r\nconversion of the ancestral mansion into an inn. With its fine gateway,\r\nits porter's lodge on either hand, its large courtyard shaded with\r\nwell-grown old trees, and its well-proportioned apartments, it is\r\ncertainly a specimen worth preserving of such a house as King Louis need\r\nnot have disdained to enter, when he made Valenciennes and French\r\nFlanders definitely French in 1677.\r\n\r\n'We have a noisy, ignorant set of people in power here now,' said my\r\nfriend, 'who pulled down, not long ago, the finest of the only three\r\ngood gates we had left, out of sheer stupidity; and you can see how they\r\nlet things go at sixes and sevens all over the city. But the\r\nold-established citizens of Valenciennes are to blame also, not for the\r\ndecline of our population perhaps, but for the gradual disappearance of\r\nall the features of the city worth preserving. Like the head of this\r\nfamily, they care nothing about the past.'\r\n\r\nIn the course of a walk about the city, he showed me, in the Rue\r\nNôtre-Dame, an edifice, the condition of which certainly excused his\r\ncriticism of his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is an ancient dwelling-house of the fifteenth century, standing at\r\nthe corner of two streets. A most graceful _tourelle_ markes the façade,\r\nand strikingly resembles that which decorates still the house at Paris\r\nnear the Rue des Francs Bourgeois, in the vaulted doorway of which\r\nLouis, Duc d'Orléans, was murdered, a crime avenged by the death, on the\r\nbridge of Montereau, of its real author, Jean Sans-Peur, Duc de\r\nBourgogne. The exterior ornamentation of this house is admirable, nor is\r\nit too far gone in dilapidation to be successfully restored. The door\r\nwas locked, boardings were fixed in some of the beautiful windows, and\r\nadvertisements of Amer-Picon and auctions and political meetings defaced\r\nthe front. Obviously the house belonged originally to some personage of\r\nimportance at a time when Valenciennes, the city of the Emperor\r\nValentinian, was still one of the great marts of Western Europe and a\r\ncapital of the civilisation of the West. Its population was then much\r\nlarger than it now is. By the Scheldt, it communicated with the sea, and\r\nin the thirteenth century it was a member of the famous Hanse of London,\r\nwhich included also, Reims, St.-Quentin, Douai, Arras, St.-Omer,\r\nAbbeville, Amiens, Bruges, Ypres, and Ghent. This league dominated over\r\nthe Channel. Its chief, the Count of the Hanse, who seems to have been\r\nin a manner a successor of the Roman Counts of the Saxon Shore, was\r\nchosen by the leagued cities from among the great burghers of Bruges.\r\nThe privileges its representatives enjoyed in London were balanced by\r\nsundry rather monastic restrictions; but it was a great commercial\r\ncorporation, and it played a great part in the social and economical\r\nhistory of mediæval Europe. As early as the ninth century Valenciennes\r\nand Mons had been so rich and influential, that they were regarded as\r\nthe pillars of the '_noble Comté de Hainault, tenu de Dieu et du\r\nSoleil_.' With the crusades, the importance of Valenciennes notably\r\nincreased, and with its importance the independence of its burghers. The\r\nleading part taken by Godfrey de Bouillon in the early crusades is a\r\nproof of the power of these Flemish towns. When Baldwin of Flanders\r\nassumed the imperial purple at Constantinople, he did it expressly to\r\nbenefit the commerce of the Flemish cities. At this day it is believed\r\nthat there exist, in some palace of the sultan at Constantinople,\r\ntapestries of Oudenarde taken to the East by Baldwin, who was born at\r\nValenciennes in 1171. At Valenciennes, too, were born his sister,\r\nIsabelle of Hainault, the first wife of Philip Augustus of France, his\r\nbrother Henry, Emperor of the East, and his two daughters. One of these\r\ndaughters, Marguerite, grown to woman's estate, besieged Valenciennes\r\nbecause the burghers refused to recognise her as the born Countess of\r\nHainault. Gilles Miniave, provost of the city, plainly said to her when\r\nhe refused to surrender: 'We have taken and we intend to kill your\r\nsoldiers, madame, as abettors of tyranny.' This was as much to the\r\npurpose in its way as the firing on the royal troops by the farmers of\r\nLexington in America in 1775.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the fourteenth century Valenciennes was so wealthy that\r\nJean Party, provost in 1357, was regarded as the richest man in Europe.\r\nHe went to Paris during the fair of the Landit, and for his own account\r\nbought up all the goods brought there for sale at one swoop; he then\r\nretailed them at a great profit. He was invited to attend the court of\r\nFrance, and went there so magnificently attired as to excite the\r\njealousy of the French nobles, who treated him in consequence with undue\r\narrogance. He took off his cloak, enriched with fur and jewels, as no\r\nseat was offered him, made it into a roll, and sate down on it. When he\r\nrose with the rest to leave, he left the cloak where he had sate on it.\r\nThe royal heralds, dazzled by the splendour of the garment, gathered it\r\nup, and one of them hastened with it after Jean Party, calling out to\r\nhim that he had forgotten it.\r\n\r\n'In my country,' said the haughty burgher turning towards the herald,\r\n'it is not the custom for people to take their cushions away with them!'\r\n\r\nOne of the predecessors of this proud citizen, Jean Bernier, gave a\r\nbanquet in 1333 to all the allies of the Comte de Flanders, which is\r\ncelebrated by the chroniclers as the grandest ever seen in Flanders.\r\nThere were sixty-nine guests, including the kings of Bohemia and of\r\nNavarre, and six tables 'so sumptuous with gold and silver plate, that\r\nthe like had never been seen.'\r\n\r\nIn 1473 a chapter was held at Valenciennes of the Golden Fleece. In 1540\r\nthe city entertained Charles V., the Dauphin, and the Duc d'Orléans. In\r\n1549 a society called 'the principality of pleasure' gave a festival to\r\n562 guests in the woolstaplers' hall. Each guest was equipped with two\r\nflagons of silver, one for wine and the other for beer, and 1,700 pieces\r\nof silver and gold plate furnished forth the table, of which the\r\nchronicler observes, to the undying glory of the city, that 'all these\r\nvessels of silver and gold belonged to dwellers at Valenciennes; and\r\nalso that _not one piece was lost_!'\r\n\r\nThe glory passed away from Valenciennes with the religious wars. The\r\nplace became a headquarters of Protestantism, and the Most Catholic King\r\nsent his armies to deal with it. The Spaniards took Valenciennes and\r\nlong held it. In 1656, under Condé, they beat off the French under\r\nTurenne, and it was only in 1677 that Louis XIV. finally captured it,\r\nand turned it over to Vauban to be fortified.\r\n\r\nAs the town stands much lower than the surrounding country, Vauban\r\nplanned his works with an eye to flooding the region, if necessary, by\r\nthe waters of the Scheldt. Valenciennes stands at 25.98 mètres above the\r\nsea-level. But Anzin, the chief suburb, is at 39 mètres, and the hills\r\nbeyond at 80 mètres above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards got the upper hand fairly in French Flanders,\r\nthousands of the workers in wool emigrated to England, carrying their\r\nindustry with them. Many of these emigrants naturally went into the\r\ncloth-making West of England, and to this day I am told by genealogists\r\nFlemish names, translated or curiously transmogrified, are to be found\r\nin Somerset and Devonshire, which attest the extent and value to England\r\nof the exodus. What its real proportions were it is hard now to\r\nestimate. The chroniclers talk of a hundred thousand people going out\r\nfrom Flanders to England between the defeat of the Armada in 1588 and\r\nthe repulse of the French from before Valenciennes in 1656. But the\r\nnumbers are obviously conjectural.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is, that during this period Valenciennes was the centre\r\nof a most interesting spiral movement (to use the phrase of Goethe) in\r\nthe history of modern Europe. Coming down later to the contest between\r\nFrance, under Louis XIV., and the allies, led by Marlborough and Prince\r\nEugene, we find Valenciennes again playing a leading part. And during\r\nthe last blind, desperate effort of France to shake off the domination\r\nof the scoundrels who had fastened themselves upon her vitals at Paris\r\nafter the collapse of the monarchy, Valenciennes became the theatre of\r\nthe tolerably well-conceived, but intolerably ill-executed, attempt of\r\nDumouriez to make himself a French Duke of Albemarle. It was quite as\r\nunprincipled as his political operations were at Paris in 1792, and in\r\nboth cases he came to grief through his overweening self-confidence and\r\nconsequent lack of the most ordinary prudence and forecast.\r\n\r\nA morning may be spent with both profit and pleasure in the galleries of\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville at Valenciennes. The building is of the early\r\nseventeenth century, and was remodelled and partially reconstructed\r\nunder the Second Empire. It is spacious and not without a certain\r\ndignity, but, like the streets and squares, it is ill kept.\r\n\r\nThe galleries which occupy the whole of the second floor are extensive,\r\nwell-lighted, and with a more careful and systematic arrangement of the\r\npictures would be of considerable value to students of art. Valenciennes\r\ncertainly had painters of merit before the sixteenth century. One of\r\nthese, celebrated by Froissart, Maître André, was both a sculptor and a\r\npainter. In 1364 he became 'imagier' of Charles V. of France. The\r\nstatues of that king, of Jeanne de Bourbon his queen, and of King John\r\nand King Philip, still extant at St.-Denis, are his work. Two exquisite\r\nmanuscripts illuminated by him still exist; one in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale at Paris, the other at Brussels.\r\n\r\nSimon Marmion, who died at Valenciennes on Christmas-day, 1489, was the\r\ncourt painter of that high and puissant prince, Philippe, Duc de\r\nBourgogne, and ranked among the chiefs of the Flemish School. Pictures\r\nof his exist at Bruges, Nuremberg, and Paris. The Valenciennes museum\r\nhas an _ex-voto_ on wood, the history of which is curious. It was found\r\nbroken into two pieces, and hidden away behind a confessional in the\r\ncathedral of Notre-Dame. How it came there no one knows. It may have\r\nbeen flung there during the pillage of the church, or put there to save\r\nit. At all events, having been carefully (not too carefully) restored\r\nand cleaned, it now presents two interesting pictures, one of St. John,\r\nholding in his right hand a book on which the Paschal Lamb reposes, with\r\nan ecclesiastic kneeling before him in a red robe, covered with a\r\ntransparent alb, a palm resting on his right arm. The other represents a\r\ndead body on a rug, half-covered with a shroud. Above, on a scroll, are\r\nthe lines\r\n\r\n  Da requiem cunctis, Deus, hic et ubique sepultis,\r\n  Ut sint in requie, propter tua vulnera quinque.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 the provost of Valenciennes, the baron Pujol de Lagrave, who\r\nserved as provost till 1789, and again after the capture of the city by\r\nthe Duke of York, established here a school of art not unworthy the\r\nbirthplace of Watteau and of Pater. Both of these painters are\r\nrepresented in the collection, the former by a characteristic little\r\n'Conversation under the Trees in a Park' and by an interesting portrait\r\nof the sculptor Pater, the father of the painter. The two families of\r\nWatteau and of Pater lived on terms of such friendly intimacy at\r\nValenciennes that the father of Pater sent his son up to Paris, to study\r\nhis art under Watteau.\r\n\r\nWatteau received his young compatriot so coldly, and made things so\r\nunpleasant for him, that he soon went back discouraged, to resume his\r\ncareer at home. There he encountered the hostility of the local\r\ncorporation of St. Luke, that guild of painters refusing to allow him to\r\npractise his art without regularly passing through his apprenticeship,\r\nand taking his 'master's degree.' Pater resisted, and the case went\r\nbefore the magistracy of Valenciennes, before the Provincial Council of\r\nHainault, and finally before the Parliament of Flanders. It was\r\ncontested for several years, and finally resulted in an arrangement,\r\nunder which Pater bound himself never to paint in Valenciennes, 'under\r\nany pretext whatsoever.' He might go to Paris and paint as much as he\r\nliked, but in Valenciennes painting was the privilege of the corporation\r\nof St. Luke. This has a pre-Adamite sound in modern ears. But even now\r\nno man may lawfully kill or cure the sick in London or Paris or New York\r\nwithout a diploma, despite the 'epoch-making' principles of 1879. And\r\nthe new French Chamber of 1889 apparently intends to forbid all foreign\r\nphysicians to attend upon patients in France! In Valenciennes, as a\r\nmatter of fact, a liberal School of Art was established in 1782, by\r\nwhich time both Watteau and Pater had done their life's work and taken\r\ntheir places among the masters in a world-wide corporation of St. Luke.\r\n\r\nTwo charming groups by Pater represent this painter in the Museum of his\r\nnative city, together with a portrait of his sister, bequeathed by M.\r\nBertin, the last representative of the Pater family in Valenciennes.\r\n\r\nA grand and well-known triptych by Rubens, representing the preaching,\r\nthe martyrdom, and the entombment of St. Stephen, in three compartments,\r\nupon the extension of which, when closed, appears a bold and striking\r\npicture of the Annunciation, is one of the chief treasures of the\r\nMuseum. It belonged to the noble monastery of St.-Amand, which was\r\nwrecked and pillaged during the Revolution, and, with the valuable\r\nlibrary of the monastery, very rich in missals and manuscripts, was\r\nconfiscated by the patriots of Valenciennes.\r\n\r\nAnother Rubens, of less importance, originally belonged to the church of\r\nNotre-Dame de la Chaussée, which was pulled down, as well as pillaged,\r\nat the same time. It seems to have been rescued from the spoilers by the\r\ngood people of the neighbourhood, and was honestly bought for the Museum\r\nin 1866, not magnificently 'presented' to it by official 'receivers,'\r\nnot much better than the original thieves.\r\n\r\nFrançois Pourbus of Bruges is represented here by two admirable\r\nfull-length portraits of Philippe Emanuel de Croy, Comte de Solre, and\r\nof his sister, Marie de Croy, and by a full-length portrait of Dorothée\r\nde Croy, Duchesse d'Arschot, in a stately wedding-dress, painted, in the\r\nfull maturity of his powers, at Paris, in 1617. This is the\r\nwedding-dress described, according to M. Foucart, an accomplished\r\namateur of Valenciennes, one of the Conservators of the Museum, by\r\nReiffenberg in his valuable book: '_Une existence de Grand Seigneur au\r\nXVI^e Siècle_,' and the Valenciennes Museum is particularly rich in\r\npictures of interest from this, which may be called the documentary,\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nAmong these must be reckoned a curious painting of the mother and the\r\nwife of Henri III., with sundry dames of high degree, and women of the\r\npeople violently squabbling together over a pair of trunk-hose, the\r\nproperty of the king, who lies prostrate in one corner of the canvas,\r\nstruck down by the clenched fist of a man in the robes of a member of\r\nthe Parliament of Paris.\r\n\r\nFrom this and from another painting on parchment which sets forth, as an\r\ninscription recites, 'the cruel martyrdom of the most reverend Cardinal\r\nde Guise by the inhuman tyrant Henri de Valois,' it may be clearly\r\ngathered that the people of French Flanders had very positive opinions,\r\nand were not slow to express them, long before the Abbé Sieyès\r\nconstituted himself the Isaac Newton of political science.\r\n\r\nThere is a goodly show, too, of historical portraits of interest, one of\r\nthe Admiral de Coligny, which was exhibited at Paris in 1878, another of\r\nFénelon, which came here from the pillage of the Chapterhouse of\r\nCambray, another of Prince Maurice of Nassau, another of Hortense\r\nMancini. A good full-length portrait of Bardo Bardi Magalotti, colonel\r\nof the 'Royal Italian' regiment under Louis XIV., is set in a very\r\nremarkable frame of superbly carved oak, part of the woodwork of the\r\ndemolished church of St.-Géry. Of historical interest, too, is a large\r\nVan der Meulen, representing the defeat of Turenne before Valenciennes\r\nin 1656, by the Spanish army under Condé. From a bird's-eye view of\r\nValenciennes in the background of this large canvas, we may see how much\r\nthe city has lost by the gradual destruction of its finest architectural\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years the Museum of Valenciennes has been endowed,\r\nthrough the munificence chiefly of a Wallachian nobleman, Prince George\r\nStirbey, well known in Paris, with a unique collection of the works of\r\nCarpeaux, the sculptor of the famous groups which adorn the façade of\r\nthe grand Opera House at Paris.\r\n\r\nCarpeaux was born at Valenciennes, and the fine statue of Watteau which\r\nstands now in the city was both suggested and executed by him. So long\r\nago as 1860, when he began to recognise his own place in contemporary\r\nart, he expressed his wish to have his memory perpetuated in his native\r\nplace by as complete a collection of his works as could be made; and in\r\nhis will, drawn up in 1874, he left to Valenciennes all his models in\r\nplaster, and all the drawings for his works, together with all the\r\nsketch-books he had filled during his artistic life, and which were then\r\nin the keeping of his relations at Auteuil.\r\n\r\nIn process of time Carpeaux found it necessary to part with a great many\r\nof his drawings, and Prince George Stirbey, who had bought most of them,\r\nafter the death of the artist, divided them into three lots, one of\r\nwhich he gave to the Louvre, another to the School of Fine Arts at\r\nParis, and the third and richest to Valenciennes. To this princely\r\nliberality, Valenciennes is indebted for the singular fulness and value\r\nof the Carpeaux collection which it now possesses.\r\n\r\nAmong the portraits in the Museum proper, is one which ought to be sent\r\nto the Musée de la Révolution in Paris. It is a pastel of a typical\r\nRevolutionary personage, who bore the not very attractive name of\r\nCharles Cochon. He was one of the 'patriots' of 1792, and having vowed\r\nirreconcilable hatred to all kings and emperors, he was selected to go\r\nas a Commissary to the Army of the North after Dumouriez had delivered\r\nup Camus and his companions with Beurnonville to the Austrians. After\r\nthe advent of Napoleon, this incorruptible Republican became one of the\r\nmost serviceable servants of the new master of France, and ended his\r\ncareer as an Imperial senator, with the queer title of Comte de\r\nLapparent!\r\n\r\nI wisely availed myself of my first morning in Valenciennes to visit\r\nthese collections in the Hôtel de Ville, for in the afternoon M. Guary,\r\nthe son of the distinguished director of the great coal mines of Anzin,\r\nwhich I especially desired to see, kindly drove into my comfortable old\r\nhotel and most hospitably insisted on carrying me off to the mines.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the last century there was but a single house in all\r\nthe territory now known as the Commune of Anzin. It is now the seat of\r\na busy and growing town, a suburb, or--to speak more exactly--an\r\nextension beyond the walls of the city of Valenciennes. This town has\r\nbeen called into existence during the last century and a quarter by the\r\noperations of the Anzin Company, the largest coal-mining company in\r\nFrance. The concessions held and worked by this company cover an area of\r\n28,054 hectares.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, when what is known as the great strike at Anzin attracted\r\nto this important region the attention of all persons interested in that\r\nquestion of labour, which the excellent M. Doumer tells us the 'true\r\nRepublic' has been 'studying' in vain for ten years, the Anzin Company\r\nemployed 14,035 workmen, of whom 2,180 were at work on the surface and\r\n11,855 were employed on the subterranean work of the mines. The coal\r\nextracted, which had reached 1,677,366 tons in 1862, amounted in 1883 to\r\n2,210,702 tons, being one-tenth part of all the coal-production of\r\nFrance. The coal-mining of Anzin is carried on now in the face of a\r\ngreat and increasing competition almost at its very doors. To the north\r\nand east lie the great coal-fields of Belgium, which in 1882 sent into\r\nFrance 4,064,625 tons of coal, and in 1883, 4,217,933 tons. On the north\r\nand west lie the great French coal-fields of the Pas-de-Calais, where,\r\nat Lens and other points, great discontent has shown itself during the\r\ncurrent year among the miners, but which increased their output from\r\n5,724,624 tons in 1882 to 6,148,249 tons in 1883. Then, beyond the\r\nChannel, England, which had sent into France, in 1882, 3,560,149 tons of\r\ncoal, in 1883 sent in 3,818,205 tons; and, finally, from Germany in 1883\r\nFrance took 1,186,769 tons against 1,035,418 tons. These figures will\r\nsuffice to show the importance of Anzin as a coal-field. It draws its\r\nprosperity from roots struck deep into the soil nearly a century and a\r\nhalf ago, and long before the traditional institutions of France were\r\nthrown into the melting-pot, amid the cheers of a mob in the streets, by\r\nanother mob which called itself a National Assembly.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the last century, when, as I have said, there was\r\nbut a single house in all the present territory of Anzin, coal was not\r\nknown to exist in this part of France. In the Low Countries, then\r\nAustrian, and just beyond the French frontier, coal was mined, and it\r\ncame into the head of an energetic dweller in the little town of Condé\r\nthat what was found in Hainault might be found also in French Flanders.\r\nHis name was Desambois, and he was not a rich man. But he succeeded in\r\ngetting from Louis XV. a concession in 1717 authorising him to seek for\r\ncoal within a considerable range of territory till 1740. The Crown even\r\ngave him a small subsidy. But the Mississippi bubble burst while he was\r\nstruggling with the difficulties which surrounded him when he first\r\nstruck certain imperfect veins of coal; and in the stress of that great\r\ncrash he found himself obliged to part with his rights for the sum of\r\n2,400 florins to two gentlemen of the _noblesse_, though not of the\r\ngreat _noblesse_, the Vicomte Desandrouin de Noelles, and M. Taffin.\r\nThere is a portrait in the Musée at Valenciennes of M. Desandrouin which\r\nshows the qualities one would expect to find in a man who so long ago\r\nand in such circumstances undertook such an enterprise with a limit of\r\nno more than eighteen years before him. These two connected with\r\nthemselves a brother of Desandrouin, a 'gentleman glassworker' at\r\nFresnes, and two brothers named Pierre and Christophe Mathieu. They\r\nworked on, undiscouraged but unsuccessful, for twelve years, until,\r\nfinally, on June 24, 1734, Pierre Mathieu, who was a trained engineer,\r\nfound at Anzin the long-sought vein of bituminous coal.\r\n\r\nThis auspicious day is commemorated on the simple slab which marks the\r\nburial-place of Mathieu in the communal church of Anzin. When one\r\nconsiders what the discovery meant, and what its results now mean, to\r\nthe welfare and the prosperity of France, one is tempted to regard the\r\n24th of June as a date almost as well worth celebrating by Frenchmen as\r\nthe 14th of July.\r\n\r\nMarshal Villars is celebrated by a very uncomely obelisk on his\r\nbattle-field of Denain near by, and General de Dampierre by a column in\r\nthe public square of Anzin itself. Why should not Anzin set up a statue\r\nof Pierre Mathieu?\r\n\r\nA comparatively short time sufficed to convince the adventurous\r\nassociates that they had indeed found the great veins they had sought.\r\nPierre Taffin went to Paris and got a considerable extension from the\r\nCrown of their concession. Money was raised and the work went on,\r\nbringing labourers and settlers to Anzin and founding the new industry.\r\nThen came a new danger, which might have been foreseen. The lords of the\r\nsoil at Anzin had been quite left out of the calculation, but the lords\r\nof the soil at Anzin in 1734 were quite as well awake to their legal\r\nrights, and to the advantages to be derived from a judicious use of\r\nthese rights, as were the small farmers of Pennsylvania long afterwards,\r\nwhen prospecting engineers began to sink shafts and to pump up oil along\r\nthe slopes of the Appalachians. The Prince de Croy-Solre and the Marquis\r\nde Cernay brought forward their title to share in the riches found\r\nbeneath their acres. Desandrouin and his associates contested these\r\nclaims as long as they could. But the contests ended, as the lawyers had\r\nseen from the first that it must, in a compromise. The Prince and the\r\nMarquis on the one hand with their titles to the land, and the Vicomte\r\nand his associates on the other with their royal concessions, came\r\ntogether, and in 1757 founded the Anzin Company.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of St.-Gobain, the capital of the company was divided\r\ninto sols and deniers. There were twenty-four deniers, of which the\r\nPrince de Croy-Solre received four for himself and two associates, the\r\nVicomte Desandrouin five sols and four deniers, the heirs of M. Taffin\r\nthree sols nine deniers, the Marquis de Cernay and his six associates\r\neight sols, and the engineer Mathieu six deniers. The phraseology of the\r\narticles of association is somewhat quaint and ancient, but the spirit\r\nof them is essentially fair and equitable. The recital of the objects\r\nfor which the company was formed is a model in its way, and shows that\r\nthe authors of these articles--nobles, rôturiers, engineers, and\r\nnotaries of the _ancien régime_ in 1757--had nothing to learn from\r\nJean-Jacques Rousseau or the Abbé Sieyès as to the essential rights and\r\nduties of men in a civilised community. Thus it runs:--\r\n\r\n'To bring about a general union of the coal-pits in the territory of\r\nFresnes, Anzin, Old Condé, Raismes, and St.-Vaast, put an end to all the\r\ndifferences and proceedings brought before the Council and as yet\r\nunsettled, make it possible to live in good union and a good\r\nunderstanding, and secure the interests of the State and of the public\r\nby forming solid establishments, there are adopted by this present act,\r\nwhich shall be duly ratified before a notary, the following articles.'\r\n\r\nThese articles are nineteen in number, and, as in the case of\r\nSt.-Gobain, one article binds the associates always to furnish, in\r\nproportion to their shares, whatever funds may be required for the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nThe hereditary principle is distinctly recognised in these articles not\r\nonly as to the ownership of the shares, but as to the management, and\r\nthe Prince de Croy-Solre and the Marquis de Cernay, with their\r\nsuccessors, are accorded certain rights as arbitrators, and in the\r\nelection of directors, a circumstance worth noting because I find that,\r\nnotwithstanding the supposed abolition by the revolutionists of 1789 of\r\nthe hereditary principle, and of titles of nobility and of privileges,\r\nthese articles of association, just as they stood when they were signed\r\nand subscribed on November 27, 1757, were quietly recognised and\r\nregistered, and a good fee taken for the recognition and the\r\nregistration by the proper republican functionary at Paris, on the '11\r\nPluviôse, An XIII' of the Republic one and indivisible.\r\n\r\nThe main street of Anzin, through which M. Guary drove me to the offices\r\nof the company, is a broad and well-paved highway, with many\r\nshade-trees, and the houses, for the main part, well built, though not\r\nparticularly picturesque. M. Guary tells me there are a good many small\r\n_rentiers_ living here, which seems to show that the place must be\r\norderly and quiet. Many of the houses are brightly painted, in blue,\r\ngreen, pink, and other colours not to be expected, and of cabarets the\r\nname is legion. M. Baudrillart pronounces intemperance to be a\r\ncharacteristic foible of the Flemish French, or French Flemings; but in\r\nthese cabarets--which were, so far as I saw, rather exceptionally neat\r\nand even handsome--the customers seemed to be taking light beer and\r\ncertain sweet beverages, rather than spirits.\r\n\r\nAt the main office I found M. de Forcade, a son of the celebrated\r\nminister of Napoleon III., to whom when he retired, on the accession to\r\npower of M. Emile Ollivier, the Emperor addressed a remarkable letter,\r\nrecognising, in the strongest terms that could be used, his abilities,\r\nhis integrity, and his patriotism. M. de Forcade had just received a\r\ntelegram from the father of M. Guary, at Paris, announcing his arrival\r\nat Anzin for the next day, and asking me to prolong my visit, which I\r\nwas very glad to do.\r\n\r\nThere are many factories at work in and around Anzin, but there is\r\nnothing Plutonian in the aspect of the place or of the neighbourhood,\r\nand the grimy side of coal-mining nowhere obtrudes itself. On the\r\ncontrary the green fields, under a very high cultivation, everywhere\r\nencroach agreeably upon the town. The residence of M. Guary, the\r\nDirector, stands in an exceedingly pretty park, and the mansion, a\r\nhandsome modern château, is surrounded with fine and well-grown trees.\r\nYou approach the mansion from the busy main streets of Anzin, traversed\r\nby a tramway leading to Denain, but from its windows and balconies which\r\noverlook the park, you gaze out upon the verdure and the spacious peace\r\nof a wide rural landscape.\r\n\r\nA certain proportion of the workmen employed in the mines prefer to live\r\nin the town; but it is the policy of the company to encourage the\r\ndevelopment of cottage life, and wherever I went throughout its\r\nextensive domain I found families of the workmen installed in\r\ncomfortable homes, surrounded by gardens and by what are called in\r\nEngland 'allotments.' Of these the company now owns no fewer than 2,628.\r\nOriginally these houses were built in the form of _cités ouvrières_; but\r\nit has been found by experience that these blocks of contiguous houses\r\nare open to certain objections from the point of view of health, as well\r\nas from the point of view of morals, and the more recent constructions\r\nare detached cottages. A model of one of these cottages was exhibited in\r\nthe social economy section of the Exposition at Paris this year, But it\r\nwas more satisfactory to see them actually inhabited and on the spot.\r\nEach cottage is built in a field of land of two acres in extent, and the\r\nrent varies from three francs and a half to six francs a month. For the\r\nlesser sum, or for forty-two francs a year, a workman at Anzin earning\r\nan average wage of three francs a day, or in round numbers a thousand\r\nfrancs a year, may thus secure a well-built house--most of those I saw\r\nwere of brick--with proper drainage and cellarage, containing two good\r\nrooms on each of three floors, with closets, and standing in its own\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nCompare this, not with the squalid and noisome single rooms for which in\r\nthe worst parts of Spitalfields a rent of tenpence a day, or five\r\nshillings a week (Sunday being thrown in free when the weekly rent is\r\nduly paid), or thirteen pounds sterling a year is exacted--but with the\r\naverage rental of lodgings in the manufacturing towns of Massachusetts!\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Whatever repairs are needed in these houses are\r\nmade, not by the tenants, but by the company, and the company further\r\nleases to its workmen, who choose to avail themselves of them, at very\r\nlow rates garden sites within each commune, for cultivation as\r\nkitchen-gardens. No fewer than 2,500 families now have such holdings\r\nunder cultivation, making a total of 205 hectares thus put to profit by\r\nthe workmen, who take a lively pleasure in cultivating them during their\r\nleisure hours.\r\n\r\nEvery workman is allowed furthermore by the company seven hectolitres of\r\nordinary coal per month for his own use. In cases of illness, or where a\r\nworkman has a family of more than six persons, this allowance is\r\nincreased. In 1888 the coal thus given by the company amounted to\r\n598,550 quintals, representing a money value of 359,150 francs. This is\r\nnot only a practical application of the Scriptural injunction 'not to\r\nmuzzle the ox which treadeth out the grain;' it is a practical\r\ncontribution to the solution of the great 'question' which M. Doumer in\r\nhis Report tells us the 'true Republic' has been for ten years making\r\nbelieve to study--of the participation of the workman in the profits of\r\nthe work. It is, indeed, from this economical and practical point of\r\nview, and not from the philanthropic point of view, it seems to me, that\r\nall these advantages conceded by the Anzin Company to its workmen should\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\nNo man of common sense needs to be told that to deal successfully with\r\nindustrial enterprises which require the investment of a large capital\r\nfor the production of commodities liable to great fluctuations in price,\r\nthe managers of such enterprises must be executive men employing\r\nexecutive methods. If all the workmen employed in such enterprises are\r\nto be admitted in the ordinary way to a participation in the profits,\r\nthey must obviously be admitted to a participation in the councils, and\r\nin the direction of the policy of the managers. How is that to be\r\nbrought about without endangering the success of the enterprises? To\r\nconsult the workmen of the company on technical questions within the\r\nrange of their regular employment is one thing; to consider the\r\ncommercial and fiscal policy of the company in its relation with\r\ncompeting companies, and with the consuming public, in a general\r\nconclave of all the establishment, would be quite another thing. It is a\r\ncurious fact that in the original statutes of 1757 the founders of Anzin\r\nexpressly provided that the six directors of the company should, when\r\nnecessary, consult not only the employés, but the workmen of the\r\ncompany--the '_ouvriers_;' and this provision was insisted on at a time\r\nwhen, as the doctrinaires of the nineteenth century would have us\r\nbelieve, 'labour' was not recognised in France as a social force to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nUnder its existing system of management the Anzin Company makes its\r\nworkmen real participants in the profits of its operations, without at\r\nthe same time exposing them to participate in the losses.\r\n\r\nThis is done not only through the singularly low rates at which the\r\nworkmen are enabled to house themselves and their families, through the\r\ncoal allowance, through the provision of cheap kitchen-gardens, and\r\nparticularly through the establishment of a pension fund and of a\r\nsavings-bank, but in many other forms.\r\n\r\nAdvances repayable without interest, for example, are made to workmen\r\nwho wish to buy or to build houses for themselves. These advances in\r\n1888 stood in the books of the company at a total of 1,446,604 francs,\r\nof which 1,345,463 fr. 91 c. had been repaid, leaving a balance due to\r\nthe company then of 101,140 fr. 9 c. With these funds workmen of the\r\ncompany had bought or built for themselves 741 houses, being thus\r\nvisibly, and unanswerably to the extent of the value of these houses,\r\nparticipants in the profits of Anzin.\r\n\r\nNot less real is the participation of the workmen in the profits through\r\nthe various beneficial and educational institutions which I visited with\r\nM. Guary, or with his son, and of which I shall presently speak.\r\n\r\nThe concessions now possessed by the Anzin Company are eight in number:\r\nthose of Vieux-Condé, Fresnes, Raismes, Anzin, Saint-Saulve, Denain,\r\nOdomez, and Hasnon. These concessions cover, in the form of an irregular\r\npolygon, about thirty continuous kilomètres of territory, stretching\r\nfrom Somain to the Belgian frontier, with a breadth varying from seven\r\nto twelve kilomètres. The total area amounts to 2,805,450 hectares.\r\n\r\nOf these concessions the four first-named were the original basis of the\r\norganisation of the company under the controlling influence of the\r\nPrince de Croy-Solre at the Château of l'Hermitage which still belongs\r\nto his family near Condé.\r\n\r\nThe others have been acquired since 1807; Hasnon, the latest, which\r\ncovers about 1,500 hectares, in 1843.\r\n\r\nBut--and this is a notable fact--the Anzin Company from the beginning to\r\nthis day has been organised and managed under the original statutes of\r\n1757. Under these statutes, devised and drawn up absolutely under the\r\n_ancien régime_, and by an association of practical engineers and\r\nenterprising adventurers with feudal seigneurs, this great company has,\r\nfor more than a century and a quarter, administered with signal success,\r\nand still administers, what may be fairly called an industrial republic,\r\ncarrying on its affairs and developing its resources in the face of the\r\nenormous changes of modern life, and maintaining here, under what are\r\nthought to be the most trying conditions of labour, a most remarkable\r\nmeasure of harmony between an ever-increasing nation of labourers and a\r\nstrictly limited administration, composed not only of capitalists, but\r\nof hereditary capitalists. What becomes of the rights of man and of the\r\nAbbé Sieyès, and of the Tiers-Etat, which 'ought to be everything,' and\r\nof the 'immortal principles of 1789,' in the face of all this?\r\n\r\nTo the wisdom of the National Assembly the workmen and the Company of\r\nAnzin owe considerably less than nothing. The National Assembly, of\r\ncourse, meddled with the mines of France, as it meddled with everything\r\nelse. It did endless debating over the subject, in the course of which\r\nMirabeau declaimed eloquently against the doctrine of Turgot, that the\r\nmines belong to the men who find them, a doctrine which, after all, is\r\nmuch more rational than the more recent contention of sundry modern\r\nOrators of the Human Race that 'the mines belong to the miners'! But\r\nafter it had talked itself hoarse, the Assembly had to descend to the\r\nprosaic business of legislation, and in dealing with the mines, as in\r\ndealing with other matters, it made a muddle of the laws which existed\r\nbefore it met, and left this muddle to be resolved into a new order of\r\nthings legal, under the presiding genius of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nUnder the _ancien régime_ the rights of the feudal lords of the land\r\nover the mines beneath the soil had been contested by the steadily\r\nincreasing power of the sovereign. In the case of the Anzin Company, and\r\nof the articles of association adopted in 1757, we see the practical\r\ngood sense of the practical men who adopted those articles bringing\r\nabout a good working arrangement between the concessions granted by the\r\nCrown and the claims advanced by the lords of the land. The republican\r\nlegislators in 1791 concocted a mining law, under which the dominion of\r\nthe sovereign, taken over by the State, was brought into perpetual\r\nconflict with the recognised, but undefined, rights of the lords of the\r\nsoil. Such was the mischief caused by this ill-digested law that, in\r\n1810, Napoleon made an end of it, and substituted for it an imperial\r\nlaw, under which the absolute ownership of mines in France might be\r\nconferred by a concession of the Government. 'The act of concession,'\r\nsays the seventh article of the law, 'gives a perpetual ownership of the\r\nmine, which from that moment may be disposed of and transmitted like any\r\nother kind of property, and no holder of it can be expropriated, except\r\nin the cases and under the forms prescribed with, regard to all other\r\nproperties.' This law of course made an end both of the royalties of\r\nthe old French system, and of the English and American doctrine that he\r\nwho owns the land owns up to the sky and down to the centre of the\r\nearth. For while the State recognises under this law the owner of the\r\nsurface, and provides that the State shall give him what may be called a\r\nkind of 'compensation for disturbance' though on a scale to be fixed by\r\nitself, it recognises in him no ownership whatever of the mine beneath\r\nhis soil.\r\n\r\nNor does it recognise under this law any right in the discoverer of a\r\nmine to a proprietary interest in a property which but for him might\r\nnever have existed as an available property at all, either for the owner\r\nof the surface, or for the State, or for the concessionary of the State.\r\nThe founders of the Anzin Company in 1757, it will be seen, recognised\r\nthe right of Pierre Mathieu, the discoverer of bituminous coal at Anzin,\r\nto such a proprietary interest in the mine he had discovered; but they\r\nrecognised it with a practical and sensible reference to the concurrent\r\nrights also of other people, and to the general utility. So much more\r\ndeftly, it would appear, were practical questions, involving the\r\ninterests of labour and of capital, handled under the _ancien régime_ by\r\npractical persons, whether nobles, engineers, or adventurers, who had a\r\npractical interest in settling them wisely, than by theoretical persons,\r\n'philosophers and patriots,' whose only practical interest lay in\r\n'unsettling' them, during the long legislative riot which began in 1789.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this period upon labour and capital in France is well\r\nillustrated in the records of this company at Anzin.\r\n\r\nIn 1720, when poor coal, _charbon maigre_, was first found by the\r\nVicomte Desandrouin and his friends at Fresnes, fifty-five tons of the\r\nmineral were extracted. In 1734, Pierre Mathieu 'struck it rich' at\r\nAnzin, and work began in earnest. By 1744 the yearly output reached\r\n39,685 tons. In 1757, when the Company of Anzin was finally formed, and\r\nthe articles of association were signed, the output of the concessions\r\nworked by the company amounted to 102,000 tons. From that time it\r\nincreased, not 'by leaps and bounds,' but steadily, till in 1789 it had\r\nreached 290,000 tons. In 1790 it increased again to 310,000 tons. Then\r\ncame a decline--gradual at first, but as things grew worse at Paris,\r\nsharp and sudden. The output fell to 291,000 tons in 1791--fell again to\r\n275,500 tons in 1792. With the murder of the king, and the final crash\r\nof law and order throughout France, in 1793 the output dropped suddenly\r\nto 80,000 tons, or less by 20 per cent. than it had been in 1756, the\r\nyear before the company was finally formed. In the next year, 1794, it\r\ndropped again to 65,000 tons, a point below that of the production in\r\n1752, four years before the formation of the company, when the lords of\r\nthe land were in the thick of their legal battle with the Vicomte\r\nDesandrouin and the concessionnaires.\r\n\r\nThings began gradually to look better as it became more and more clear\r\nthat the Republic could not last, and with the establishment of the\r\nConsulate and the Empire they grew better still. But it was not till\r\n1813 that the output approached the figure reached in the last year of\r\nthe monarchy, 1790.\r\n\r\nWith the disasters of 1814 and 1815, of course, it fell again; but\r\nwithin two years after the restoration of the monarchy, in 1818, the\r\noutput reached and passed the highest point attained before the\r\nRevolution, and stood at 334,482 tons. In 1830 the output had reached\r\n508,708 tons, but the revolution of that year threw it back again, in\r\n1831, to 460,864 tons. Under the monarchy of July, the production\r\ngradually, though not regularly, increased again, until in 1847 it had\r\nreached 774,896 tons, only to be struck down by the senseless Revolution\r\nof 1848 to 614,900 tons in 1849. It went up with the establishment of\r\nthe second Empire in 1852 to 803,812 tons in 1853, and by 1870 had\r\nreached 1,633,818 tons.\r\n\r\nUnder the governments of M. Thiers and of the Marshal-Duke of Magenta,\r\nduring which, according to M. Doumer, the Republic existed 'only in\r\nname,' the output went up till, in 1877, it passed the two million\r\nlimit, only to recede again with the advent to power of M. Gambetta and\r\nhis friends, with their 'true Republic,' under which it fell in 1884 to\r\n1,720,306 tons. The elections of 1885, marking the rise of a great\r\nconservative and monarchical reaction, were followed, in 1886, by an\r\nincrease in the output of the Anzin mines to 2,337,439 tons; and in\r\n1888, when from one end of France to the other, the Republic was\r\nofficially and almost hysterically declared by the authorities to be in\r\ndeadly peril, and men were speculating as to whether President Carnot,\r\nor General Boulanger, would open the Exposition in 1889, the Anzin\r\noutput reached 2,595,581 tons.\r\n\r\nOf course, account must be taken of other than political considerations\r\nin estimating the significance of this record, nor do I wish unduly to\r\ndwell upon what may be called its barometrical value in the study of\r\ncontemporaneous French history.\r\n\r\nBut when we consider the relations of coal to all the great industries\r\nof our time, it is certainly noteworthy that for more than a century\r\nevery development in Paris of a tendency favourable to republicanism in\r\nFrance, should appear to have been followed by an unfavourable effect,\r\nand every development unfavourable to republicanism in France by a\r\nfavourable effect upon the production, at Anzin, of a mineral which has\r\ncome to be the 'staff of life' of all modern industry and commerce.\r\n\r\nFor during the whole of this period Anzin has been what it still is, the\r\ncoal-capital, as St.-Gobain is the glass-capital, and Creuzot the\r\niron-capital of France. Its mines produce about one-tenth of the total\r\noutput of French coal. A falling off, therefore, in the output of the\r\nAnzin mines may be fairly enough taken as an indication of disease in\r\nthe body politic of France. The most considerable falling off in this\r\noutput of late years was in 1884, when the production fell to 1,720,306,\r\nfrom 2,210,702 in the preceding year, 1883. Two of the great French\r\nindustries, the iron industry and the sugar industry, both of them most\r\nimportant consumers of coal, were then passing through a period of\r\ndepression, the over-production of sugar in Germany having seriously\r\ndamaged the French sugar-producers in particular. To meet the pressure\r\nput upon them by the decline in the demand for coal, the directors of\r\nthe Anzin Company found it necessary to carry out certain economies,\r\neither through a reduction of wages or through some modification in\r\ntheir methods of production.\r\n\r\nIf they had been allowed to do this through an undisturbed arrangement\r\nwith their workmen, there is no reason to doubt that it would have been\r\ndone with little friction, and with no injustice to anyone. Wages at\r\nAnzin had steadily risen from a daily average, for the surface workmen,\r\nof 3 fr. 67 c. to 4 fr. 52 c. in 1883, concurrently with the development\r\nat Anzin of that system of practical participation in the profits to\r\nwhich I have already alluded. For the subterranean workmen, the advance\r\nhad been from 3 fr. 38 c. in 1879 to 3 fr. 72 c. in 1883.\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which the Anzin Company has been administered from the\r\nbeginning is strikingly illustrated by the steady advance in the wage of\r\nthe workmen. In Belgium, one of the chief seats of the competition with\r\nAnzin for the coal-market of France, on the contrary, the wages of the\r\nworkmen are subject to the fluctuations of the general market. In 1873,\r\nfor example, the average wage of the workmen in the mines of Hainault,\r\nas given to me by M. Guary, was 4 fr. 69 c., or about 25 per cent. above\r\nthe average wage of 1883 at Anzin. But 1873 was the year of the great\r\nadvance in coal. In 1876 the average Hainault wage fell to 3 fr. 45 c.;\r\nin 1879 it fell to 2 fr. 68 c., and in 1880 it stood at 3 fr. 6 c. By\r\n1880 the average wage at Anzin had risen (and steadily risen) to 4 fr.\r\n23 c.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1883 the expenditure of the Company upon the assistance\r\nfund, the pension fund, the medical services, the gratuitous supply of\r\nfuel, the cottages, in addition to, and not at the expense of, the wages\r\npaid, reached a total of 1,224,730 francs. During this same year the\r\nprofits of the company, as stated after an inquiry by the French\r\nMinister of Public Works, amounted to 1,200,000 francs. This really\r\nseems to warrant the assertion that at Anzin in 1883 the profits of the\r\nmines were virtually divided into two equal portions, one of which went\r\nto Capital and the other to Labour. Assuming this assertion to be, even\r\nroughly speaking, accurate, why should there have been any serious\r\ncollision between Capital and Labour, in such an organisation, over a\r\nquestion of practical economies necessarily advantageous to both?\r\n\r\nYet there was such a collision. In February 1884, what is known as the\r\ngreat strike at Anzin broke out over a proposed improvement in the\r\nmethods of working, the demonstrable effect of which must be to improve\r\nthe position of the best workmen employed by the company, without doing\r\nreal injustice to others. A similar strike had occurred a quarter of a\r\ncentury before, when the company insisted on introducing from England\r\nand Belgium the use of ponies in the subterranean galleries. But in 1884\r\nthe conservative instinct of the workmen, which predisposes them in all\r\ncallings against innovations of any kind, was adroitly worked upon and\r\ninfluenced by the direct influence of the politicians of the 'true\r\nRepublic' at Paris. A workman of the company named Basly, who had taken\r\nan active part in organising a syndicate of mining workmen under a law\r\npassed in 1881 to favour such syndications, put himself into\r\ncommunication with the advanced Radicals at Paris, constituted himself\r\nthe champion of the syndicates of workmen, and, according to the\r\ntestimony given before a parliamentary committee, fomented a formidable\r\nexterior pressure upon the workmen at Anzin, to bring about the strike\r\nwhich eventually took place, and in connection with which M. Basly\r\nbecame a conspicuous figure in French Republican politics, receiving a\r\nmuch larger wage as a deputy than he had ever earned in the mines at\r\nAnzin, where, as the books of the company show, though by no means an\r\nexceptionally good workman, he earned, in 1881, 4 fr. 93 c., and in 1882\r\n4 fr. 71 c. a day.\r\n\r\nOne obvious object of the syndicates of workmen being to establish a\r\nkind of despotic control over all the workmen of any calling, the\r\nsyndicate of mining workmen at Anzin set itself, a year before the\r\nstrike, in 1883, to break down what is known at Anzin (and elsewhere in\r\nFrance also, M. Guary tells me) as the system of 'marchandages.'\r\n\r\nUnder this system the company makes contracts with the workmen at a\r\nfixed price for coal, deliverable during several months. A good\r\nworkman, holding one of these contracts and stimulated by it, frequently\r\ngains from 20 to 25 per cent. more than the average daily wage of his\r\nclass. The syndicate wished to establish 'equality' of wages, or, in\r\nother words, to put idle or inferior workmen on the same level with\r\nindustrious and superior workmen.\r\n\r\nTo this end, the leaders resorted to the methods usual in all such\r\ncases, of intimidation and actual violence. Workmen at Anzin who had\r\ntaken 'marchandages' were attacked and beaten, some of them so severely\r\nas to disable them for weeks.\r\n\r\nAt the parliamentary inquiry which followed the strike of 1884, such\r\nletters as the following, sent to workmen at Anzin, a year before, in\r\n1883, were produced and read in evidence:--\r\n\r\n     'CACHAPREZ\r\n\r\n     'Citizen,--In the name of the syndical chamber of the miners of\r\n     Anzin, thou art forewarned that, if thou dost not cease thy\r\n     _marchandage_, as we have informed Lagneaux, thou wilt pass, in the\r\n     sight of thy brethren coal-miners, for a traitor and a coward, as\r\n     well as thy seven comrades, who are worth no more than thyself.\r\n\r\n     'If thou dost not what we exact of thee, be not surprised to find\r\n     thyself stretched out a bit, and to be laid up for three weeks, as\r\n     well as the good-for-nothings who are working with thee.\r\n\r\n        'Receive our great contempt.\r\n\r\n            'A group of workmen who will caress thee\r\n            one of these days if thou dost not give\r\n            up thy marchandage.'\r\n\r\nLetters like these, which would not discredit the rural terrorists of\r\nKerry and Clare, were followed, not only by attacks on the obnoxious\r\nworkmen, but by the destruction of their flowers and vegetables in the\r\ngardens which, as I have stated, they are enabled by the company to\r\ncultivate. As a workman may go to his work as soon as he likes in the\r\nmorning (the gates are closed just before six o'clock), they have their\r\nafternoons to themselves, and those of them who have gardens I found\r\nworking there with great evident satisfaction at most of the points\r\nwhich I visited.\r\n\r\nWith the outbreak of the 'strike' in 1884, matters grew worse. Dynamite\r\nwas then called into play. Fusees were exploded under the windows and in\r\nthe doorways of workmen who refused to be coerced into leaving their\r\nwork. As nearly nine-tenths of the workmen had gone, or been driven,\r\ninto the strike, the cabarets in which the region abounds were filled\r\nwith crowds of idle men. Radical speakers and managers hurried down to\r\nAnzin from Paris, to harangue the multitude and stir the people up to\r\nmischief, and the position of the workmen who stood out against an\r\nagitation which they knew to be founded on no grievance of theirs, and\r\nwhich could have no possible result for them but to injure the company,\r\nwith the prosperity of which they felt their own prosperity to be\r\nidentified, became really dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn the thick of the contest thus provoked and carried on, it is\r\ninteresting to find M. Allain-Targé, of whom I have already had occasion\r\nto speak, in connection with his conduct as Minister of the Interior\r\nduring the elections of 1885, appearing on the Parliamentary Committee\r\nof Inquiry, of 1884, into the situation at Anzin, as a friend and\r\nadvocate of the 'syndicate of workmen,' and urging the Anzin Company to\r\naccept the syndicate and its secretary, M. Basly, as an umpire between\r\nitself and the 'strikers,' who had been seduced or coerced into\r\n'striking' by this very syndicate and its secretary!\r\n\r\nWhat possible good, either to Labour or to Capital, can be rationally\r\nexpected--what possible harm to both may not be legitimately\r\nfeared--from a republic controlled and administered by such men?\r\n\r\nOne curious and important incidental object of the 'syndicate of\r\nworkmen,' and of M. Basly in promoting this strike of 1884 at Anzin,\r\nrevealed itself to me in the very full Report of the Parliamentary\r\ninquiry which M. Guary was good enough to put at my service.\r\n\r\nAfter devoting large sums of money to the various institutions and funds\r\nestablished by it for the benefit of the workmen, the Anzin Company\r\ninvited the workmen themselves to contribute to their own savings and\r\npension fund at the rate of three per cent. of their wages, the expenses\r\nof management being borne, of course, by the company. The 'syndicate of\r\nworkmen' and M. Basly did not like this. They preferred that any\r\ncontributions to be made by the workmen from their wages should be made,\r\nnot to a fund guaranteed and administered by the company, but to a fund\r\nto be handled by the syndicate.\r\n\r\nWhereupon M. Basly wrote, and caused to be circulated among the workmen,\r\na letter signed by himself as secretary of the syndicate, in which he\r\nbade them regard the proposal of the company as 'a snare set for their\r\nliberties.' 'To sign any such agreement as the company suggests,' he\r\nsaid, 'will be to sign your own death-warrant and that of your\r\nchildren!'\r\n\r\n'Citizens! your enemies see our Union established. They know that we are\r\non the point of having a pension fund solidly established _under the\r\nguarantee of the State_, which shall leave us all free to work whenever\r\nwe like.'\r\n\r\nThis idea of a Labour Pension Fund under the guarantee of the State is\r\nnot, I need hardly say, of M. Basly's invention. It 'trots through the\r\nheads' of all manner of political adherents of M. Doumer's 'true\r\nRepublic.' It was very neatly 'thrashed out' in a brief colloquy which.\r\nI noted down one day in Paris between a representative of the 'syndicate\r\nof jewellers' and a deputy, M. Thiessé. 'What would you think?' asked M.\r\nThiessé, 'of an obligatory assessment on wages, intended to secure, by\r\nthe authority of the State and with perfect safety, a certain pension to\r\nthe workmen of your corporation?'\r\n\r\nWhereunto the jeweller, M. Favelier, replied: 'We prefer freedom in this\r\nrespect, as well as from the point of view of our work.'\r\n\r\nM. Thiessé returned undismayed to the charge.\r\n\r\n'Then you would prefer to organise a pension fund in your syndical\r\nchamber? But if you had not means enough to ensure pensions to your\r\nworkmen, what would you think of an institution which would ensure them\r\na pension and bread for their old age?'\r\n\r\nTo which M. Favelier, suddenly striking the bull's eye and 'ringing the\r\nbell': 'We do not want the State called in, to lay new taxes upon us!'\r\n\r\nM. Basly, who is probably a consumer rather than a payer of taxes, had\r\nmore 'advanced' views than the Parisian jeweller. But his chief\r\nimmediate object evidently was to secure contributions from the wages of\r\nthe Anzin workmen to a fund to be controlled by the syndicate. What the\r\neventual meaning to the contributing workmen of a fund so controlled is\r\nlikely to be may be inferred from an incident which came to my knowledge\r\nnot long ago, in London. A question arose between a certain association\r\nof English engineers, and men employed by one of the great English\r\nrailway companies, over an issue not unlike that presented at Anzin by\r\nthe demand of the 'syndicate of miners,' that the Anzin workmen should\r\ngive up their long time and profitable contracts. The men in the\r\nemployment of the railway were old and excellent railway men, who were\r\nearning, on a kind of special contract, something like a pound a week\r\napiece more than the usual rates paid to their class. They were members\r\nof the association referred to, and, as such, had for many years\r\ncontributed to its funds under a system which promised them a certain\r\npension at the expiration of a certain number of years. This being the\r\nsituation, these men were notified by the association that if they did\r\nnot give up their special contracts and content themselves with the\r\nusual wages earned by others of their class, they would, in the first\r\ninstance, be fined, out of their own money in the hands of the\r\nassociation, a pound a week for a given time, at the end of which, if\r\nthey still remained in disobedience, their pensions would be forfeited!\r\n\r\nI should be glad to know what 'employer' ever devised a more shameless\r\nplan than this for reducing workmen to slavery, moral and financial?\r\nProbably the laws of England, if called upon, would protect them against\r\nsuch outrages. But how is a workman in such circumstances to call upon\r\nthe laws? How is he to meet the legal cost of defending his rights? How\r\nis he to face the organised hostility of men of his own class?\r\n\r\nThe 'strike' at Anzin in 1884 ended as 'strikes' are apt to do. A\r\ncertain proportion of the men who had been foremost in accepting or\r\npromoting it disappeared from the service of the company; others, and\r\nthe majority, escaped from the domination of the 'syndicate' and of M.\r\nBasly. That the conduct of the company throughout the crisis was such as\r\nto commend itself to the workmen in general may, I think, be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that a fresh attempt to bring about a 'strike' at Anzin,\r\nsince I visited the place, completely failed. The attempt originated\r\nwith the leaders of a 'strike' which was actually carried out in the\r\nmines of the adjoining Department of the Pas-de-Calais. The means\r\nemployed in 1884 to intimidate the workmen at Anzin were again used. The\r\ntroops and the gendarmerie were, however, called out at Anzin, not to\r\nprotect Capital against Labour, but to protect the working-men of Anzin\r\nwho chose to keep out of the 'strike,' against men of their own class\r\nwho tried to drive them into it. In this case the original 'strike'\r\nseems to have been provoked by local rather than general causes. The\r\nmanagers of the mines in the Pas-de-Calais had resolved to increase the\r\noutput of their mines. This necessitated a considerable increase in the\r\nnumber of miners employed, and this augmented demand for mining labour,\r\nnot unnaturally, led the men to demand an advance on their wages. They\r\nwere encouraged to demand this advance, too, by a somewhat sudden rise\r\nin the market-price of certain descriptions of coal, and it is not\r\nperhaps surprising that it should not have occurred to them to ask\r\nthemselves whether the rise in the market price did, or did not, mean a\r\nreal increase of profits to their employers, who, of course, could only\r\ntake a very partial advantage of the advance, on account of the long\r\ncontracts under which by far the greater part of their output had to be\r\ndelivered to their customers.\r\n\r\nI drove with the younger M. Guary through a charming bit of woodland\r\ncountry, to visit a newly-opened pit--the Lagrange pit. Part of the way\r\nled us through a large forest full of fine, well-grown trees. The\r\nshooting in this forest is good, chiefly deer and pheasants. It belongs\r\nto the domain of the State, and is leased to a former director of Anzin.\r\nThat the country is a pleasant land to live in appears from such facts\r\nas this, as well as from the blue, yellow, russet and rose-pink houses\r\nwhich enliven the long highway from Valenciennes, and are the\r\nhabitations of well-to-do people living here on their incomes. From\r\nValenciennes to the Belgian frontier, indeed, the road is virtually one\r\nlong continuous street of houses and gardens, as the railway is between\r\nNew York and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nM. Guary pointed out to me the house of another ex-director of Anzin who\r\nhas invested in a considerable tract of land here, on which he has put\r\nup a number of exceedingly neat houses. They are built of brick, like\r\nthe small houses to which the working-men of Philadelphia are indebted\r\nto the philanthropic enterprise of Mr. Drexel and Mr. Childs; but I\r\nthink it would astonish Mr. Drexel and Mr. Childs to know that a brick\r\nhouse, containing four good 'upright' rooms and two good garret rooms,\r\nall wainscoted in hard wood and well fitted up, well drained, and with a\r\nlarge cellar and a garden rather wider than the house, running back for\r\nseveral hundred yards to a fringe of picturesque forest, can be rented\r\nhere, from this private proprietor, for 120 francs, or $24 a year.\r\n\r\nAt an average wage of 4 fr. 50 c. a day, working 25 days in the month,\r\nan average workman at Anzin may easily earn 1,350 francs a year, so that\r\nhe may rent such a house as I have here described for a good deal less\r\nthan one-tenth of his income. What is the ordinary proportion between\r\nthe house-rent and the income of a respectable tradesman or mechanic in\r\nNew York? But the Anzin workman who rents such a house as this on such\r\nterms, enjoys also free fuel, free medical attendance, and schooling for\r\nhis children.\r\n\r\nWe called at one of these private houses, seeing the miner, whom M.\r\nGuary knew very well, standing at ease in his doorway and surveying the\r\nscene with a pipe in his mouth. He was a shrewd, stalwart man of about\r\nforty, who glanced down complacently at his own well-developed limbs and\r\nlaughed scornfully when I asked him what he thought of a proposition I\r\nhad seen made at Paris, by a friend of the workmen, that forty should be\r\nfixed as the age of retiring pensions for miners. 'He may be a friend,'\r\nsaid the miner, 'but certainly he is not a miner!'\r\n\r\nThis miner had long done his day's work in the mine, and after his pipe\r\nwas going to work in his garden, where his vegetables were coming\r\nforward very well. Nothing could have been better than his\r\nmanners--quiet, manly, civil, without the rather aggravating slyness of\r\nthe ordinary French peasant, and with absolutely nothing of the\r\ninfantine swagger of the small French _bourgeois_. These miners here\r\nwear a picturesque and practical costume, something between the garb of\r\na sailor and the garb of a fireman, and as their life--like the life of\r\na fireman or a sailor--is lived a good deal apart from the lives of\r\nother men, and has a constant spice in it of possible danger, they\r\nacquire a certain self-reliance and self-possession which give them a\r\nnatural ease and even dignity of carriage. In talking with more than one\r\nof them I thought I detected a slight tone of contempt towards other\r\nworkmen and especially towards the peasants, such as tinges the talk of\r\na sailor about land-lubbers. M. Guary confirmed this, and told me that\r\nthe men, especially of the old mining stock, certainly do regard\r\nthemselves as rather better than their neighbours.\r\n\r\nThis may have something to do with the Conservative strength in this\r\nregion. Politics do not apparently run very high among the miners,\r\neither here or in the adjoining region of the Pas-de-Calais.\r\nValenciennes covers three electoral districts, and the Anzin concessions\r\nextend into each of these districts. In the second or St.-Amand\r\ndistrict there was rather a lively contest in September, between M.\r\nGirot, a Republican, and M. de Carpentier, a Boulangist. The latter\r\nreceived 5,894 votes, but the former was elected, with 8,331 votes. In\r\nthe first Valenciennes district the outgoing member, an Imperialist, M.\r\nRenard, was re-elected, receiving 5,803 votes, against 4,856 given to\r\nhis Republican competitor.\r\n\r\nIn the second district another outgoing member, M. Thellier de\r\nPoncheville, a leading Royalist, was also re-elected, receiving 8,690\r\nvotes, against 7,263 given to his Republican opponent. In both of these\r\ncases it came within my knowledge that the authorities of the Department\r\nmade the most open and unscrupulous efforts to prevent the return of the\r\noutgoing members. Both M. Thellier de Poncheville and M. Renard,\r\nhowever, sate on M. Pion's Committee on the mines, and the mining\r\npopulation of the region appear to have a singularly clear notion of the\r\ndifference between sense and nonsense in dealing with mining matters.\r\n\r\nOur miner, who hit the difference so neatly between 'miners' and the\r\n'friends of miners,' after a little chat on the doorway, asked us, very\r\npolitely, to walk in and look at his home. It was very neatly and\r\nadequately furnished, with clocks in each of the ground-floor rooms,\r\nsundry framed mezzotints hanging on the walls, and a goodly show of\r\nneatly-kept crockery. The wife, looking older than her husband, but very\r\nprobably his junior, cheerily pointed out to me the local improvement\r\nshe had made by transferring the cooking-range from the front room,\r\nlooking on the highway, to the back room looking into the garden. 'It is\r\npleasanter, don't you think?' she said, 'to sit out of the kitchen; and\r\nthen, with the kitchen at the back, one can always leave the door open.\r\nThat is my idea!' We assured her we thought it an excellent idea and\r\nmost creditable to her--a compliment which she received with modest\r\nsatisfaction, saying, 'You know the wife must think of these things!' to\r\nwhich the husband good-naturedly assented, while the daughter, a\r\nwell-grown good-looking girl of fourteen, looked up from her household\r\nduties, much interested in our visit. The husband, on his part, had\r\ncontrived a convenient wine-cellar under the stairway. 'It will not hold\r\nmuch wine,'he said with a smile; 'but it is too large for all the wine I\r\ndrink.' 'Ah!' said the wife archly, 'he likes cider much better!'\r\n\r\nThis miner was employed in the new Lagrange pit, and though I was much\r\nstruck by the neatness of his person and apparel, I was more struck by\r\nthe general absence of anything like the griminess which we commonly\r\nassociate with mines and mining among his fellows, whom I found still at\r\nwork around the pits. M. Guary told me that this is a characteristic\r\ntrait of the Anzin miners. In the buildings attached to each pit there\r\nis a large hall, called the miner's hall, where the men meet when they\r\ngo down to and come up from their underworld. There each man has a box,\r\nunder lock and key, bearing his number, in which he puts away his\r\nordinary clothes when he dons his mining suit; the company--I should\r\nmention here--provides every man when he enters the service with a\r\nmining outfit. And to this hall there is attached a lavatory for the use\r\nof the men. The hall is well warmed in winter, and, being always on an\r\nupper floor, is well aired and ventilated in summer. From this hall at\r\nthe Lagrange pit we walked into an adjoining room, where we found the\r\nminers going down the shaft in a great metallic basket, while the coal\r\ncame up. While we stood there, there came up a magnificent lump of coal,\r\nof a very brilliant and even lustrous surface, around which the\r\nadmiring miners crowded. This is a new vein, and the coal found in it,\r\nM. Guary tells me, burns with an unusually clear and intense flame.\r\n\r\nA miner with whom I talked a little had been to see the Exposition, and\r\nit was curious to perceive that he had been much more interested in the\r\nAnzin part of it than in anything else. He spoke indeed almost\r\ndisrespectfully of the Eiffel Tower, and he was entirely convinced that\r\nthe workmen at Anzin were much better off than the workmen at Paris, as\r\nto which I am not prepared to dispute his opinion. He had not seen the\r\nPresident, which did not appear to disturb him much; but he thought the\r\nbeer at the Exposition 'very dear and very bad.' The engines, however,\r\nhe frankly admired, though 'everybody can see that it is not possible to\r\nmake better engines than are made at Anzin.'\r\n\r\nOne curious thing he told me of the young miners who are drafted away\r\ninto the military service. 'When they come back,' he said, 'some of them\r\nat first try other trades, but all that are of any use sooner or later\r\ncome back to the mine. It is of no use,' he said reflectively, 'for any\r\nman to try to be a miner if he is not trained as a boy.' This is exactly\r\nJack Tar's notion as to sailors.\r\n\r\nFrom the Lagrange pit we drove, still through pleasant woods and fresh\r\ngreen farming-lands, to Thiers, where the company has a large number of\r\nworking-men's houses, together with a considerable church, a lay and a\r\nreligious school, and other institutions.\r\n\r\nThere we paid a visit to a delightful little old lady, with a face, full\r\nof wrinkled sweetness and humour, which Denner might have painted. She\r\ninsisted upon showing us all over her home, and a little miracle it was\r\nof thrift and neatness and order; from the spotlessly clean little\r\nbedrooms with the high Flemish beds, the crucifix hanging over the bed,\r\nand prints--not always devout--on the walls, to the sitting-room with\r\nits shining mirror, highly polished tin and brass candlesticks and\r\nplatters, and abundant china. She was a staunch Imperialist, and had\r\nportraits of the Emperor, with prints of Solferino and of Sedan. 'There\r\nit was that they betrayed him!' said the little old lady, with deep\r\nindignation in her voice. I had not the heart to ask her who these\r\ntraitors were. The garrets I found filled with new-mown hay. 'It keeps\r\nthere till we sell it,' she said, 'and then it smells so sweet!' which\r\nwas undeniable. Behind her house (her son and his wife were both absent\r\nat their work) she showed us the garden, very trimly kept and gay with\r\nthe old familiar flowers, and an arbour, in which she took especial\r\npride, none of her neighbours possessing anything of the sort.\r\n\r\nAt Thiers I talked with an officer of the company who had served for\r\nsome time in one of the great mines of Southern France. The differences\r\nin the habits and character of the mining populations there and here he\r\nfound very great, and, on the whole, he evidently thought the Northern\r\nminers much superior, in most essential points, to their fellows at the\r\nSouth. Certainly, according to him, they are neater in their persons,\r\nmore cool and sensible, less credulous, less addicted to politics, and\r\nmuch more thrifty. 'The women, when they are well-behaved and good\r\nmanagers,' he said, 'have more influence with the men in the North. In\r\nthe South and in Auvergne, I have sometimes thought the worst women had\r\nmore influence with the men than the best.'\r\n\r\nHe had an odd theory as to the effect of great altitudes on human\r\ncharacter. 'In Auvergne and in Savoy,' he said, 'the higher up you go\r\nthe more excitable and quarrelsome you find the people. Here in Flanders\r\nthe people are placid, like the plains.' He called my attention, too, to\r\nthe prevalence among the miners here at Anzin of a peculiar type of\r\nblonds with a sort of ruddy russet hair and beard, not quite the glowing\r\nTitianesque auburn, and yet by no means red. It is certainly a marked\r\nand peculiar tint, and may be seen faithfully reproduced in a large\r\npicture of the Anzin miners exhibited this year at Paris. I had supposed\r\nit to 'hark back' to the Scandinavians, who made themselves so much at\r\nhome in all these fat and accessible regions after Charlemagne passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\n'No,' said my philosophic engineer, 'it is due to the potash. These\r\nminers are so addicted to washing themselves and use such quantities of\r\nstrong soap, that it has permanently affected their hair.' Upon which\r\nanother engineer, also familiar with Auvergne, broke in: 'That's all\r\nvery well; but I have seen many miners in Auvergne with the same tint of\r\nhair and beard, and you know that there they wash their faces, at the\r\nmost, once a week!'\r\n\r\nThis last speaker was an exceedingly shrewd man and, as I found, a\r\nstrong Conservative. He had been asked to stand as a candidate for mayor\r\nin his commune, but had declined, though his personal popularity made\r\nhis election almost a matter of form. I asked him why. 'Let myself be\r\nelected to a political office by my workmen!' he said; 'how can a\r\nsensible man think of such a thing? Ask men to give you their votes, and\r\nwhat authority will be left to you? No, I think I know my business too\r\nwell for that. They tried that sort of thing, you know, during the war,\r\nand a beautiful business they made of it! I suspect it was the Germans\r\nwho suggested it!'\r\n\r\nWhat I am told of the morals of the people here reminds me of the\r\ntraditional reputation of certain sections of Pennsylvania settled by\r\nthe Germans in the last century, and of the Dutch in Long Island. There\r\nis a good deal of drinking. _Buvettes_ are forbidden within the limits\r\nof the _cités ouvrières_, but in the communes they are very numerous,\r\naveraging, I am assured, as many as twenty to every 1,200 inhabitants.\r\nTo open a _buvette_ nothing is needed but a police permission, and the\r\n_buvettes_ are kept, for the most part, by the wives of miners and other\r\nartisans, as a means of adding to the family income. Beer is very cheap,\r\ncosting only two sous a litre. Wine and spirits are more costly, though\r\na great deal of gin is made, and inexpensively made, in the country.\r\nThere is much sociability among the people, and great practical\r\nliberality as to the conduct of young girls, the ancient practice known\r\nas 'bundling' in New England being still in vogue among these worthy\r\nFlemings. M. Baudrillart, who evidently inclines to a favourable\r\njudgment of these Northern populations, puts the truth on this point\r\nvery considerately.\r\n\r\n'Conspicuous historical examples,' he observes, 'prove to me that the\r\nflesh is weak in this province of Flanders. The severity of public\r\nopinion does not always make up for the laxity of the control exercised\r\nby principle. Unmarried mothers are numerous, and incidents of this sort\r\nare often regarded as simple errors of youth and inexperience, to be\r\nremedied by marriage. The marriage-tie when formed, however, is not less\r\nrespected than among our rural populations in general, and cases of\r\nflagrant misconduct on the part of married women are rare.'\r\n\r\nOffences against persons and property are not relatively numerous here.\r\nOn the contrary, while the proportion of persons accused of crime is 12\r\nto the hundred thousand, for all France, in this Department of the Nord\r\nit falls to 8-1/3 to the hundred thousand, and this notwithstanding the\r\nnumbers crowded into the great manufacturing towns of the department. In\r\nthe Department of the Seine, which includes Paris, the proportion rises\r\nto 28 to the hundred thousand, and in the agricultural Department of the\r\nEure, which is the champion criminal Department of France, to 30 to the\r\nhundred thousand. One might almost imagine that M. Zola must have gone\r\nto the Eure for his studies of French peasant-life.\r\n\r\nWithout being particularly devout, the people of this region, I am told,\r\nare fond of their religious observances, and much dislike the\r\npersecution of the Church and the laicisation of the schools.\r\n\r\nAt Thiers the church, which is a large one, fronting on an extensive\r\nPlace Publique, was very handsomely decorated on Corpus Christi Sunday\r\nby the people of the commune. Flags and garlands were put up, too, all\r\nabout the Place Publique. The Anzin Company are now building a large\r\nschool for girls very near this church; and I visited, with M. Guary,\r\none afternoon, the boys' school at Thiers. It is very well installed in\r\na large building, with a playground and a gymnasium roofed in, but not\r\nwalled. The teacher--a lay teacher, and a very quiet, sensible man--who\r\nlives in the school-building with his wife, told me he preferred to keep\r\nit thus, and the boys liked it better. They were at their lessons when I\r\nvisited the school, and a very sturdy, comely lot of lads they were.\r\nSome of them were _en pénitence_, having slighted their lessons, as the\r\nteacher slily intimated, by reason of the great Church festival. This I\r\nthought not unlikely, and he did not appear to regard it as an\r\nabsolutely unpardonable offence, while the juvenile criminals themselves\r\nwere evidently quite cheery in their minds. In a room near the\r\ngymnasium were racks filled with wooden guns. These the teachers pointed\r\nout with pride. They were a gift from the company to his battalion of\r\nboys, who delighted in their regular military drill. He thought them,\r\nafter only eighteen months' training, one of the best boy-battalions in\r\nthe department, and would have liked to take them to Paris to compete\r\nfor the athletic prizes. But to take up even a picked company of ten\r\nwould have cost 400 francs, which he thought, and I agreed with him,\r\nmight be better spent in Thiers. 'And then,' he said with a smile, 'what\r\na life I should have led in Paris, with those ten boys to look after!'\r\n\r\nThe Anzin Company used to spend 80,000 francs a year on keeping up its\r\nown schools. But it is so heavily taxed for the 'school palaces' which\r\nhave been put up, and for the public schools, that it has materially\r\nreduced this outlay, though it still expends a large sum in various ways\r\nfor the advantage of the children of its own workmen attending the\r\npublic schools; and still keeps up certain religious schools, especially\r\nfor the little children and the girls.\r\n\r\nOne of these schools for little children which I visited at St.-Waast,\r\nkept by the Sisters, was a model. The little creatures, ranged in\r\ncategories according to their years, were pictures of health and good\r\nhumour, as they sate in rows at their little desks, or marched about,\r\nsinging in choruses. One exercise, through which a number of them, from\r\nsix to eight years old, were conducted by two of the Sisters, might have\r\nbeen studied from a fresco by Fra Angelico representing the heavenly\r\nchoirs, and gave the most intense delight evidently to the singing\r\nchildren as well as to the smiling and kindly Sisters. There is a large\r\nchurch, too, at St.-Waast and a _cité ouvrière_.\r\n\r\nThe commune, I believe, formerly was a part of the wide domain of the\r\nfamous Abbey of St.-Waast which grew up near Arras over the burial-place\r\nof St.-Vadasius, to whom after the victory of Clovis over the Germans at\r\nTolbiac in 495 the duty was confided of teaching the Frankish king his\r\nChristian catechism. He had a tough pupil, but he taught him, so well\r\nthat King Clovis conceived a great affection for him, and got St.-Rémi\r\nto make him bishop, first of Arras, and then of Cambrai.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Revolution the great abbey near Arras, which bore his\r\nname, was one of the richest of the religious communities which,\r\naccording to the very important _Avis aux députés des trois ordres de la\r\nprovince d'Artois_, so thoroughly and instructively analysed by M.\r\nBaudrillart, held among them in 1789 two-thirds of the land of that\r\nprovince. M. Baudrillart's analysis of this _Avis_ shows conclusively\r\nthat a judicious and systematic overhauling of these ecclesiastical\r\nproperties was absolutely necessary; but it also shows conclusively that\r\nthe people of Artois who desired this wished to see it done decently and\r\nin order. They had a strong love of their provincial independence. Even\r\nMaximilian Robespierre, who was then bestirring himself in public\r\nmatters at Arras, addressed his first political publication, which he\r\ncalled a 'manifesto,' not to the people of Artois, but to 'the Artesian\r\nnation.' This from the future executioner of the French federalists is\r\nsufficiently edifying as to the great 'national' impulse to which we are\r\nasked by a certain school of political rhapsodists to attribute that\r\noutbreak of chaos in France called the 'great French Revolution.'\r\n\r\nWhat the Tiers-Etat of the great and solidly constituted province of\r\nArtois really wanted before 1789 is clearly set forth in this remarkable\r\n_Avis_. They did not want the 'Rights of Man,' or the downfall of\r\ntyrants, or any vague nonsense of that sort. They wanted a more fair and\r\nequitable system of taxation, and a better system of agriculture. They\r\nhad some practical ideas, too, as to how these things could be got, for\r\nthey knew that these things had been got in England. 'The Englishman of\r\nour times,' they said, 'gets an income of 48,000 pounds from a square\r\nmile of land, whereas the Artesian can hardly get 12,000 pounds from the\r\nsame area. Yet the soil of Artois is in nowise inferior to that of\r\nEngland. The enormous difference can only be attributed to the\r\nencouragement and the distinctions which the English Government bestows\r\nupon agriculture, and to the better system of the English\r\nadministration.'\r\n\r\nThis passage reads almost like an extract from the diary of Arthur\r\nYoung, and it is noteworthy that Arthur Young at this same time, while\r\nhe was commending in his diary the admirable quality of the deep,\r\n'level, fertile plain of Flanders and Artois,' also expressed his\r\nopinion that 'nowhere in the world was human labour better rewarded than\r\nthere.' Taken together, however, the _Avis_ and the diary of Arthur\r\nYoung prove that the leaders of the Tiers-Etat of Artois in 1787 were\r\nneither radicals nor revolutionists, but practical men, who wished to\r\nsee the value of their property improved, and the natural advantages of\r\ntheir province more adequately developed. To this end they thought it\r\nnecessary that the constitution of the Provincial Estates should be\r\nreformed. Thanks to a combination, as the _Avis_ declares, of the\r\nmunicipalities of the towns with the _noblesse_ and the higher order of\r\nthe clergy, the _curés_--'that most interesting class of men who are\r\nalone in a position to make the needs of the people understood and to\r\nwork for their relief--were entirely excluded from the Provincial\r\nEstates in 1669, as were also the farmers, who alone can supply the\r\nmeans of perfecting our agriculture.'\r\n\r\n'Here,' said the _Avis_, 'is the true cause of the prostration of our\r\nrural interests.' They proposed to apply a remedy by recasting the\r\nrepresentation in the Provincial Estates, and giving 'two deputies out\r\nof three to the rural population.'\r\n\r\nThis having been done, so that agriculture might get in Artois the voice\r\nwhich the author of the _Avis_ believed it to have in England, they then\r\nproposed a reconstruction of the system of taxation. On this point they\r\ninclined to adopt, from the South of France, the system of paying the\r\ntaxes not in money but in kind. The system of the tithes, too, needed a\r\ncomplete overhauling, not with the mere object of abolishing the tithes,\r\nbut in order that the gross inequalities which the _Avis_ sets forth as\r\nexisting, in regard to the impact of the tithes, both territorial and\r\npersonal, might be done away with, and the support of religion put upon\r\na sound basis. This led naturally to a demand for the release of great\r\nareas of valuable soil in Artois from the control of religious\r\ncommunities, like the Abbey of St.-Waast, not a few of which were no\r\nlonger in a condition to put these possessions to the best uses, either\r\nfor the Church or for the country. In Artois, as in French Flanders, the\r\nextent of these ecclesiastical domains which had once been an advantage\r\nto the people, is admitted to have become disadvantageous to French\r\nagriculture with the decline of the feudal aristocracy and the growth of\r\nthe royal power. Short leases only were granted in general by the Church\r\nand the monasteries, and under these short leases the farmers hesitated\r\nto improve their holdings.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the _Avis_ desire that it may be made possible to obtain\r\nleases of even twenty-five years which should not be treated by the\r\nTreasury as an 'alienation' of the property leased. With such leases,\r\nthey say, 'the farmer would not hesitate to lay out money upon his land,\r\nbecause he would feel sure of getting the benefit of the outlay. This,'\r\nthey add, 'is one of the principal means which the English Government\r\nhas employed in bringing agriculture to the state of perfection in which\r\nwe now see it in that monarchy.'\r\n\r\nAs the greater part of the _cahiers_ of grievances prepared by the\r\nTiers-Etat of Artois for the States-General of 1789 have been lost, this\r\n_Avis_ is of great value, as setting before us the real objects of that\r\norder in Artois. The _cahiers_ of the Artesian _noblesse_ and the clergy\r\nfor the States-General are all preserved, and in respect of the general\r\nobjects to be aimed at in the States-General, these _cahiers_ go much\r\nfarther than the _Avis_. They seem to show that in Artois, as throughout\r\nthe kingdom, the _noblesse_ and the clergy were much more enamoured of\r\nwhat are now called the 'principles of 1789' than were the body of the\r\nagricultural population.\r\n\r\nThe _noblesse_ and the clergy of Artois wished to see the States-General\r\ncalled at regular intervals, like the English Parliament. They wished\r\nthe Provincial Estates to be maintained and to be convened annually, and\r\nthey wished a provincial administration to be established under a system\r\nwhich should give the Tiers-Etat a representation equal to that of both\r\nthe other orders united, and in which decisions should be reached not by\r\na vote of the orders collectively, but by the members of the whole body\r\nvoting individually, so that a measure as to which all the members for\r\nthe Tiers-Etat should be of one mind, might at any time be carried if\r\nthey could secure the adhesion of even a small number of the members\r\nfrom either of the other orders. Clearly it was not necessary, in the\r\ncase of Artois, that the Tiers-Etat should be declared to be\r\n'everything,' in order that justice might there be done to the wishes\r\nand the interests of the Tiers-Etat! And if not in the case of Artois,\r\nwhy in the case of any other French province?\r\n\r\nThe _Avis_ shows that in Artois before 1789 the representatives of the\r\nTiers-Etat had confidence in the liberality and the common sense of the\r\n_noblesse_ and of the clergy, and that they were disposed to consider\r\nall the abuses there needing reformation in the spirit of practical\r\ncompromise which had presided over and made possible the development of\r\nliberty and of progress in Holland and in England, but of which no\r\ntraces are to be found in the chaotic history of the 'National Assembly'\r\nof 1789. The authors of the _Avis_, for example, point out, in dealing\r\nwith the questions of the tithes and of the seignorial dues in Artois,\r\nthat it is the unequal and irregular impact, above all, of those\r\nimpositions to which most of the evils flowing from them must be\r\nimputed; the ill-feeling they engender between the farmer and his\r\nlandlord or his pastor, the bad blood they breed between the different\r\norders. If the charges of one sort and another upon one field of a\r\nfarmer's holding amounted, as was sometimes the case, to one-fifth of\r\nthe value of the crop, while upon other fields of his holding the\r\ncharges amounted to no more than one-thirtieth of the value of the crop,\r\nthe farmer not unnaturally gave his chief care to the fields which were\r\nleast heavily encumbered, without much troubling himself as to their\r\nagricultural merits relatively to the other fields.\r\n\r\nBut while the authors of the _Avis_ earnestly desired to see all this\r\nchanged, and called for the most complete revision and re-organisation\r\nof the agricultural system in Artois, they raised no philosophical\r\nclamour against privileges as privileges, and they had sense enough to\r\nsee that no community could afford to bring about the abolition of the\r\nmost obnoxious 'privileges' at the cost of any flagrant violations of\r\nthe Rights of Property. 'Whatever may have been the origin of these\r\nrights,' say the authors of the _Avis_, 'their antiquity has made them\r\nproperty to be respected in the hands of those who possess it. To\r\ndeprive these owners of these rights would be an injustice and an act of\r\nviolence of which no citizen can possibly dream. The privileged orders\r\nmust be asked to divest themselves of their privileges.'\r\n\r\nHere is a recognition of 'vested interests' for which we may look in\r\nvain from the motley mob of the 'National Assembly' into which the\r\nStates-General of 1789 so rapidly resolved, or--to speak more\r\nexactly--dissolved, themselves! With men of the Tiers-Etat, in a\r\nprovince like Artois, who could see things so plainly and state them so\r\nfairly before the convocation of the States-General, what became the\r\nFrench Revolution, plunging the whole realm into anarchy, might surely\r\nhave been made a reasonable and orderly evolution of liberty. Such a\r\ndocument goes a good way in support of the contention that with ordinary\r\nfirmness, consistency, and courage on the part of the luckless Louis\r\nXVI., the convocation of the States-General in 1789, instead of leading\r\nFrance, as it actually led her, through a quagmire of blood and rapine,\r\ninto what George Sand felicitously called the 'merciless practical joke\r\nof the Consulate,' and the stern reality of the despotic First Empire,\r\nmight easily have resulted in converting the absolute monarchy of Louis\r\nXIV. into such a limited and constitutional monarchy as France really\r\nenjoyed under Louis XVIII. The pathway to the Inferno of the Terror was\r\nreally paved with the good intentions of the king.\r\n\r\nBeyond St.-Waast lies the considerable town of St.-Amand-aux-Eaux, to\r\nwhich General Dumouriez transferred himself, on the pretence of taking\r\nthe waters there, while he was working out his plans for saving France\r\nby marching on Paris and upsetting the Assembly. The plans miscarried\r\nmainly through his own fault, but it is a curious vindication of the\r\npatriotism of Dumouriez in making them that, while he was explaining to\r\nthe lunatics in Paris, in January 1793, the absurdity of attempting to\r\noverthrow the English power in India, and the German empire in Europe,\r\nbefore feeding and clothing their armies on the frontier, de\r\nBeurnonville, whom Dumouriez was destined to seize and arrest at\r\nSt.-Amand, was himself writing from the headquarters at Sarrelouis to\r\nCochon Lapparent at Paris that everything was going to the dogs, and\r\nthat the Government was mad about chimeras. 'We think of nothing,' he\r\nsaid, 'but giving liberty to people who don't ask us to do it, and with\r\nall the will in the world to be free ourselves, we don't know how to\r\nbe!'\r\n\r\nSt.-Amand now has a population of ten or twelve thousand souls. Part of\r\nthe Anzin property lies within the communal limits, but the place is a\r\nbusy place and has industries of its own. It is connected with Anzin and\r\nwith Valenciennes by a steam tramway, and I went there with M. Guary one\r\nfine summer morning to see what is left of the once magnificent\r\nBenedictine monastery of the seventeenth century, which was the great\r\nfeature of St.-Amand a hundred years ago. A picture preserved in the\r\ncollection at Valenciennes gives a fair notion of the extent and\r\nmagnificence of the abbey, the demolition of which has been going on\r\nfrom 1793 to this day. M. Guary remembers the stately ruins as much\r\nmore extensive in his youth than they now are, and as the good people of\r\nSt.-Amand have very recently allowed the local architect to put up,\r\nunder the very shadow of the exquisitely beautiful belfry still\r\nstanding, one of the most dismal and commonplace brick school-houses I\r\nhave seen in France, it is to be presumed that a few more years will see\r\neverything pulled down, and replaced, perhaps, by a miniature\r\nreproduction in steel and iron of the Eiffel Tower.\r\n\r\nBefore the deviltries of 1789 began, the marketplace of St.-Amand must\r\nhave been one of the most picturesque in Northern Europe. The market is\r\nstill held there, and the place was full when we crossed it of peasant\r\nwomen and peasants, carts laden with vegetables, tables set out with all\r\nmanner of utensils, with fruits, with knicknacks. All was bustle and\r\nanimation. It was the old picture, save for the uncomely modifications\r\nof our modern costume. But of the splendid architectural frame in which\r\nthat picture once was set, how little now is left!\r\n\r\nBeside the lofty belfry, one of the most graceful seventeenth-century\r\nbuildings now to be anywhere seen, a few arches of one of the cloisters\r\nand one of the great abbatial gatehouses converted into a town-hall! The\r\nVandal Directory of Chauny dealt more rationally with Prémontré than the\r\n'patriots' of St.-Amand with their superb abbey. Had they preserved it,\r\ntheir town would now have possessed not only an architectural monument\r\nof interest and importance, but ample space and the best possible\r\n'installations' for all its public uses and offices.\r\n\r\nLike all the Benedictine abbeys, St.-Amand was a home of letters and of\r\narts. What remains of its noble library is to be found, as I have said,\r\nin the collection at Valenciennes. Of the treasury which the abbey\r\ncontained in the way of sculpture, painting, brass and iron work,\r\ncarving in wood, no such account can be given. Such of these as escaped\r\ndestruction were looted, sold, and dispersed. There is a tradition, well\r\nor ill-founded, that some exceedingly fine sixteenth-century monuments\r\nexecuted by Guyot de Beaugrant, the sculptor of the matchless\r\nchimney-piece which, in the Chambre Échévinale at Bruges, commemorates\r\nthe expulsion of the French under Francis I. from Flanders, were brought\r\nhere and set up in the abbey. If so, no trace of them remains. In the\r\ngatehouse, of which the local authorities have taken possession, a few\r\nfine old books, relics of the abbatial library, are still kept, and the\r\nvaulted chapter-room on the upper floor, used now as a council chamber,\r\ncontains four interesting _dessus de porte_ painted here by Watteau. The\r\nsubjects are scriptural, of course; but as, in spite of all her efforts,\r\nthe obliging damsel who acted as our cicerone could not possibly manage\r\nthe blinds and sashes of the lofty window in the octagonal room which\r\nthey adorn, it was impossible to make out to what period of the artist's\r\ncareer they belong. Upon one of them--the 'Woman taken in Adultery'--we\r\ngot light enough thrown to show that its colouring is admirable. It can\r\nhardly have been painted while Watteau was at work in Paris on his\r\nendless reproductions of the then popular St.-Nicholas, but must\r\nprobably have been executed after his study of Rubens in the Luxembourg,\r\nand his failure to win the first prize at Rome had opened to him his\r\ntrue path to fame, and carried him into the French Academy of Fine Arts\r\nas 'the painter of festivals and of gallantry.'\r\n\r\nThe fine old church of St.-Amand has fared better than the abbey. It has\r\nbeen judiciously restored, and the third Napoleon made it an historical\r\nmonument. Despite the Radicalism of the place, we found it thronged\r\nwith people of both sexes--the men, indeed, almost in a\r\nmajority--attending a high mass. It was rather startling, as we emerged\r\nfrom this service on our way back to Anzin, to come upon a large cabaret\r\nwhich bore for its sign the words, in glaring gilt letters, 'Au Nouveau\r\nBethléhem, Estaminet Barbès.' Whether this is the conventicle of a sect\r\nof believers in the revolutionary Barbès I could not learn. But it is\r\njust possible that the Barbès, whom it celebrates, may be the\r\nenterprising proprietor of the place, and that the sacred name he has\r\ngiven it is a relic of that familiar use of holy things which never\r\nscandalised the good people of the Middle Ages, particularly in Flanders\r\nand in France. Does not the best old inn in the comfortable town of\r\nChâlons-sur-Marne to this day bear the name of 'La Haute Mère de Dieu'?\r\n\r\nI have already said that the miners of Anzin have been practically\r\nenjoying all the advantages of co-operation, while the 'true\r\nRepublicans' of M. Doumer have been 'studying' and going to sleep over\r\nthat 'beautiful and generous idea.' As a matter of fact, the\r\n'Co-operative Society of the Anzin Miners,' now known in commerce as\r\n'Léon Lemaire et Cie of Anzin,' was founded, I find, even before the\r\nCo-operative Association of the Glass-workers at St.-Gobain.\r\n\r\nIt was organised in 1865, two years before the passage of the Imperial\r\nlaw affecting co-operation.\r\n\r\nM. Casimir Périer, a son of the Minister of Louis Philippe, and the\r\nfather of the present Republican deputy of the same name, was then a\r\ndirector of the Anzin Company. He had seen what M. Doumer fantastically\r\nimagines to be the purely French and republican 'idea' of co-operation\r\ncarried out in England, the 'beautiful and generous idea,' as even every\r\nFrench schoolboy ought to know, being of English and not of French\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nM. Périer had been particularly struck by the great success of the\r\nRochdale experiment--an experiment begun and carried out, as Mr.\r\nHolyoake has set forth at length, by weavers, who, being nearly at the\r\nend of their tether, and worn out with distress, had associated\r\nthemselves into a company under the name of the 'Equitable Pioneers of\r\nRochdale.' He looked thoroughly into the history of this experiment, and\r\nhaving convinced himself that the 'beautiful and generous' idea might\r\nbear as good fruit at Anzin as at Rochdale, he went to work in earnest,\r\ngot the society organised, accepted the honorary chairmanship of it, and\r\nset it on its feet on February 21, 1865. M. Cochin took the same matter\r\nup at St.-Gobain, and in 1867 the Imperial law, about which M. Doumer\r\nand his 'true Republicans' have been cackling and dabbling for ten\r\nconsecutive years, was enacted, and the co-operative associations became\r\nlegally constituted bodies. The statutes which now govern the Anzin\r\nAssociation were adopted on December 8, 1867, and the Association was\r\nformally launched.\r\n\r\nThe authorities at first could not be made to understand that a\r\nco-operative association was not a mercantile speculation, and for some\r\ntime the Anzin Association was compelled to pay a regular fee for a\r\nlicence, or 'patent,' as it is called in France. This exaction, however,\r\nwas long ago given up.\r\n\r\nUnder the original statutes the profits derived from the sale to the\r\nmembers of the Association, and to them only (a rule never departed\r\nfrom), of all the goods purchased by the Association, were to be divided\r\ninto a hundred parts. Of these, seventy parts were to be distributed at\r\nthe end of each year to the members, proportionally to the sales and\r\ndeliveries made to each of them. Twenty parts were to be set aside for a\r\nreserve fund; and the remaining ten parts were to be used by the\r\ngoverning committee chiefly in paying the salaries of the manager and\r\nemployees of the Association.\r\n\r\nSuch was the success from the outset of the Anzin experiment that within\r\nsix years, at a general meeting held on April 24, 1872, the Association\r\nadopted a resolution suspending the payment over into the reserve fund\r\nof the twenty parts of the profits set aside to be so paid, and ordering\r\nthese twenty parts also to be paid over to the members semi-annually.\r\nThe reserve fund had already reached proportions which made it\r\nunnecessary and even undesirable to increase it.\r\n\r\nThe Association was originally constituted for a term of twenty years,\r\nfrom December 10, 1867. At a general meeting held on March 27, 1887, its\r\nlife was prolonged for another twenty years, or to December 10, 1907.\r\n\r\nIt might edify M. Doumer as to the nationality of the 'beautiful and\r\ngenerous' idea which his 'true Republicans' find it so difficult to\r\n'study,' if he would take the trouble to visit this Anzin region. He\r\nwould find the establishments of the Association currently known by the\r\nEnglish name of 'stores.' I found one of them flourishing in every\r\ncommune which I visited in the vicinity of Anzin; at St.-Waast, where\r\nthe experiment was first made, at Denain, where during the past year it\r\nhas been found necessary to establish two stores instead of one--at\r\nAnzin, at Fresnes, at Thiers, at Abscon, at Vieux-Condé! The\r\nAssociation, indeed, which began in 1865 with fifty-one members and a\r\nsubscribed capital of 2,150 francs, now conducts no fewer than fifteen\r\n'stores,' and now consists of no fewer than 3,118 families.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Association, originally fixed at 30,000 francs, in\r\n600 shares of fifty francs each, was increased by a vote of a general\r\nmeeting in April 1882 to 250,000 francs. The 'firm-name' is now 'Lemaire\r\nand Company,' the present manager being M. Léon Lemaire, who can use\r\nthis 'firm-name' only for the affairs of the Association. The manager\r\n(or _gérant_) is elected at a general meeting to serve for three years,\r\nbut he is always re-eligible. His salary is fixed by the governing\r\ncommittee, and the amount of it is charged to the general expenses. The\r\ngoverning committee has power also to present the manager, if it thinks\r\nproper, with a certain sum each year taken from the ten parts of the\r\nprofits which are set apart by the statutes of the Association to be\r\nused for such purposes by the Committee. All the persons employed by the\r\nAssociation in various capacities are taken, as far as is found\r\ncompatible with the interests of the business, from among the families\r\nof the members. This is particularly the case with regard to the young\r\ngirls, of whom forty-eight are now employed in the different drapery and\r\nmercery stores, and an excellent practice has been adopted of calling in\r\na certain number of girls when there is a special pressure of business\r\nto serve for a short period, these girls being regularly registered, and\r\nthus constituting a sort of reserve corps, from which the permanent\r\nemployees are taken as vacancies are made.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Association cover all manner of commodities\r\nexcepting butcher's meat, it having been found that there are\r\ninsuperable difficulties in the way of dealing in butcher's meat over so\r\nwide an area. These difficulties do not exist in the case of what the\r\nFrench call _charcuterie_. A central pork butchery has been established\r\njust outside the _octroi_ at Anzin, and the business done in that line\r\nnow averages about 30,000 kilogrammes a year, the difference per\r\nkilogramme between the buying and the selling prices averaging about\r\neighteen francs. It is the iron rule of the Association never to sell at\r\na figure beyond the average ruling retail prices in the shops, it being\r\nquite clear that if it should now and then be necessary, in order to\r\ncover the Association, to sell at prices equivalent with the shop\r\nprices, the members would still have a real advantage in the eventual\r\ndistribution of the profits.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to examine the statutes, and the rules adopted under\r\nthem, without being struck by the precision, clearness, and efficiency\r\nof the methods prescribed to keep the accountability of all the\r\ndifferent agents of the Association within easily definable limits, and\r\nto simplify, in the final adjustment, the necessarily complicated\r\naccounts of so many stores dealing with customers many of whom must,\r\nfrom the force of circumstances, be allowed a credit of a fortnight as\r\ncash. The proof of all such methods, of course, is the net result. In\r\nthe case of the Co-operative Association of Anzin this proof is\r\nconclusive in favour both of the methods and of the men by whom they\r\nhave for now more than twenty years been administered.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Association for the first semester of its\r\nexistence closed on February 22, 1866, with sales amounting to 71,020\r\nfr. 10 c., and with the payment to the members of an 8 per cent.\r\ndividend, amounting in all to 8,228 francs. From that day to this, the\r\nsemi-annual dividend has never fallen below eight per cent., excepting\r\nfor the half-year ending August 22, 1868, when it was declared at 7-1/2\r\nper cent. By August 1872 it readied 12 per cent. and stood there for\r\nthree semesters. It then fell to 10 per cent., and stood there from\r\nFebruary 28, 1874, to August 28, 1878, when it rose to 11. By August 31,\r\n1879, it rose to 12, and by February 29, 1884, to 13 per cent., at which\r\nfigure it has stood ever since down to February 28, 1889, with two\r\nexceptions--August 31, 1884, when it rose to 14, and February 28, 1887,\r\nwhen it fell to 12-1/4.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of sales made to the members between February 1866 and\r\nFebruary 1889 was 38,864,999 francs; and the total amount of dividends\r\npaid to the members during that period has been 4,585,557 fr. 69 c.,\r\nshowing an average dividend during these twenty-three years of\r\n11.80 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that this is a very good account rendered of a very\r\ngood stewardship, and involves, for the workmen interested, a number of\r\nuseful practical lessons on the true relations of capital to labour,\r\nincluding the relations of their own capital to their own labour. There\r\nare now about 800 Co-operative Associations of Consumers in France; but\r\nthe Anzin Association is by far the most important of them all. As the\r\nexisting associations are estimated to consist on an average of 550\r\nmembers each, we have 440,000 heads of families, and a total presumable\r\npopulation, therefore, of not far from 2,000,000, more or less\r\nsuccessfully availing themselves of the co-operative principle in\r\nFrance. The net profits vary greatly in the returns of these\r\nassociations, from 1 to 14 per cent. The Co-operative Coal Association\r\nof Roubaix shows a net profit of 21 per cent., and the Co-operative\r\nBakery of the same busy and thriving city a profit of 23 per cent. But\r\nthe Anzin Association not only covers more ground than any of the rest:\r\nit covers it in a more equably satisfactory fashion. During the past\r\nyear, on an employed capital of 156,150 francs, it made sales amounting\r\nto 2,303,836 francs, with a gross profit of 450,497 fr. 61 c., and a net\r\nprofit of 310,106 fr. 30 c. Each man had spent an average of 738 fr. 28\r\nc., and received a net profit of 99 fr. 45 c. In other words, every\r\nholder of a 50 franc share paid for his share out of a single year's net\r\nprofit, and pocketed 49 francs to boot!\r\n\r\nAs indicating the scale of comfort attained in their daily life by these\r\nminers and their families, it is of interest to glance over the\r\nschedule of the goods and commodities supplied by these co-operative\r\nstores, it being premised that the stores do not keep or sell what are\r\nregarded as 'articles of luxury,' so that in these schedules we have the\r\npresent scale of the necessaries and comforts of ordinary life among the\r\nmore industrious and thrifty of the French working-classes. That even in\r\nthe seventeenth century the French artisans, and the more prosperous of\r\nthe French peasants, lived much more comfortably than one would infer\r\nfrom the pictures usually painted even by such historians as Michelet,\r\nwho, with all his theories and all his imagination, took more trouble\r\nthan M. Thiers to keep within hailing distance of the facts, would seem\r\nto be shown by the inventories and the wills of artisans and peasants\r\ndisinterred during the last quarter of a century from the local archives\r\nof Troyes and other important towns.\r\n\r\nHere, in the Anzin district, to-day, we find these co-operative stores\r\nsupplying to 3,000 families of the working-class 12,000 metrical\r\nquintals or bales of the finest quality of wheat flour, 3,000 of these\r\ngoing to the houses of the members, and 9,000 to the bakery of the\r\nAssociation, which turns out, on an average, 1,100 loaves, of 3 kilos\r\neach, per day. With this bread the members take from the stores annually\r\n110,000 kilos of the best butter, 50,000 kilos of coffee, 37,000 kilos\r\nof chicory, 4,000 kilos of chocolate, 13,000 Marolles cheeses from the\r\nland of Brétigny--where Edward III. was scared by a tremendous\r\nthunderstorm, which made him 'think of the day of judgment,' into giving\r\npeace to France and liberty to her captive king--200,000 kilos of\r\npotatoes, 6,000 kilos of prunes d'Enté, 11,000 kilos of rice, 15,000\r\nbottles of wine, 12,000 bottles of vinegar, 33,000 bottles of spirits of\r\nvarious sorts, 45,000 kilos of salt, 6,000 boxes of sardines, 100,000\r\nkilos of maize and corn, 34,000 kilos of bran, 90,000 kilos of sugar,\r\n20,000 kilos of beans, 30,000 kilos of ham, sausages, and other products\r\nof the pork-butchery. That butcher's meat, which, for the reasons I have\r\nmentioned, the stores cannot supply, plays a large proportional part in\r\nthe obviously good dietary of these families, may, I think, be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that the stores annually dispose of 10,000 pots of the\r\nbest French mustard, and of 1,000 kilos of white pepper. Vegetables and\r\nfruits are supplied in abundance by the country, and in many cases by\r\nthe allotments of the workmen themselves, while beer, as I have said, is\r\neverywhere abundant and cheap.\r\n\r\nThat the miners and working-people of Anzin are well lodged and well fed\r\nmay be considered to be beyond a doubt. Let us now see what they do in\r\nthe way of clothing themselves, and of furnishing their houses.\r\n\r\nThey buy from the stores annually 30,000 francs'-worth of kitchen and\r\nhousehold utensils, which are both well made and cheap in all this part\r\nof France, 600 kilos of mattrass wool, 4,400 yards of sheeting, 500 wool\r\nand cotton blankets and bedspreads, 9,000 towels, 44,000 pairs of\r\nsabots, 10,000 pairs of shoes, 4,600 caps and hats, 2,200 pairs of\r\nstockings, 3,700 shirts and 6,000 mètres of shirting, 17,000 mètres of\r\n_piqué_, 2,000 undervests and 2,000 mètres of flannel, 6,000\r\nhandkerchiefs, 52,000 mètres of linen goods, 17,000 mètres of lustrines;\r\n7,200 mètres of merinos, 7,000 mètres of muslins, 14,000 mètres of\r\n_Indiennes_, 57,000 francs'-worth of mercers' wares, 24,000 mètres of\r\ncalicoes, and, finally, 3,100 yards of velvet. When we remember that\r\nthis is the annual outlay for keeping up the household wardrobe, not the\r\noriginal outlay in establishing it, it seems to me that the workpeople\r\nof Anzin ought to be, and indeed one need only walk and drive about the\r\nregion to see that they are, at least as well clothed as they are housed\r\nand fed.\r\n\r\nUmbrellas even have come to be regarded as 'necessities' here, and the\r\nstores annually supply 1,300 of these useful but essentially fugitive\r\narticles. The men are clothed by their village tailors and bootmakers\r\nchiefly, so that the masculine wardrobe is represented in the accounts\r\nof the stores less extensively than the feminine. But the Anzin miners\r\nnevertheless annually invest in scarves and cravats to the number of\r\nmore than 4,000. Each man on going into the employ of the company\r\nreceives, as I have said, a complete mining outfit, the cost of which is\r\nnot defrayed out of his wages. But the miners annually buy, on an\r\naverage, 500 new mining-suits for themselves.\r\n\r\nTables, chairs, bedsteads, bureaux, well made and often handsome, are to\r\nbe had in all these communes at very low prices; and I went into no\r\nhouse in any of them which did not seem to me well equipped in these\r\nparticulars. Engravings, coloured and plain and lithographs, are to be\r\nfound in them all, and though the people are obviously not much addicted\r\nto literature, I found in one miner's house at Thiers quite a collection\r\nof books, and most of them good, sensible, and instructive books,\r\ninstalled in an upper chamber, in which the housewife said, her 'man'\r\nliked to sit and read when it was too hot out of doors in the garden.\r\n\r\nThis good dame, by the way, was of the opinion that 'the house gives you\r\nthe character of the wife,' and that 'the conduct of the husband depends\r\nupon the character of the wife.' Her own 'man' was evidently an\r\nexcellent and orderly person, so I considered it a legitimate compliment\r\nto assure her that I entirely agreed with her.\r\n\r\nI hope, for the future of France, that she may be right. For there seems\r\nto be a tendency here, as there certainly is in other parts of France,\r\nto insist on sending their girls to the religious schools, even when\r\nthey allow their boys to attend the lay schools, where they are exposed\r\nto having the 'true Republican' deputies and functionaries of the time\r\nget up--as M. Doumer did the other day, at the opening of a new lay\r\nschool in the Aisne--and propound the doctrine that 'morals have nothing\r\nto do with religion.'\r\n\r\nThe lay schools are attended, for example, in Anjou by 22,451 boys, and\r\nonly 3,562 girls: while the free congreganist schools are attended by\r\n25,360 girls, and only 5,232 boys.\r\n\r\nAdding the number together, this gives us a total of 30,592 children in\r\nthe religious, as against 26,013 in the anti-religious or irreligious\r\nschools of one province.\r\n\r\nIf my good housewife at Thiers is right as to the influence of the\r\ncharacter of the women in France upon the conduct of the men, there is\r\nhope in these figures, which I am assured pretty fairly represent the\r\nstate of things in Flanders as well as in Anjou, with the difference\r\nthat the proportion of boys attending the religious schools is probably\r\nlarger in Flanders than in Anjou. M. Doumer's doctrine that 'morals\r\nshould be taught independently of religion' certainly did not commend\r\nitself to all his constituents. The _Journal de St.-Quentin_, commenting\r\nupon it, plainly said, 'The verdicts of our assize courts show us every\r\nday the result of the atheistic instructions recommended by M. Doumer\r\nand the rest of the Masonic Brothers. The truth simply is that if some\r\nremedy be not soon found for the situation created by these people, who\r\nare as stupid as they are mischievous, in a few years we shall be\r\nobliged either to decuple the gendarmerie, or to allow every citizen to\r\ngo about armed with a revolver, in order to protect himself against our\r\nmuch too liberally emancipated young scolos!'\r\n\r\nCuriously enough this voice from St.-Quentin in France substantially\r\nechoes another voice from another St. Quentin in California--the seat of\r\nthe State Penitentiary in that young and active and opulent American\r\ncommonwealth. In California the plan of giving instruction in morality,\r\nindependently of religion, has been tried much longer than in France,\r\nand certainly in circumstances much more favourable to its success. The\r\nresult, as set forth in an Official Report of the resident director,\r\ncited by Mr. Montgomery, ex-assistant Attorney-General of the United\r\nStates, in his treatise on 'The School Question,' is that, while the\r\nilliterate convicts in the California penitentiary, at the date of the\r\nreport, numbered 112, against 985 who could read and write, '_among the\r\nyounger convicts they could all read and write_'.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of many of the advantages offered by the Anzin\r\nCompany to its workmen and miners, as amounting really to a kind of\r\nparticipation in the profits of the company. This, I think, must be\r\nadmitted to be clearly the case with regard to certain regulations\r\naffecting workmen's pensions, established here by the governing council\r\nof the company in December 1886.\r\n\r\nThese regulations are to affect workmen who contribute to what is known\r\nas the 'National Retiring Fund for Old Age.' This fund was established\r\noriginally in 1850 under the presidency of Louis Napoleon. It was\r\nre-organised by a law passed in July 1886, and by a decree issued in\r\nDecember 1886. It is under the guarantee of the State, and is\r\nadministered by a committee co-operating with the Ministry of Commerce.\r\nIts object is to enable working-men and others to secure annuities up\r\nto the amount of 1,200 francs a year, at or after the age of fifty, by\r\nthe payment of small regular assessments on their wages. The smallest\r\nsums are received by the fund, which of course is managed on principles\r\nnot unlike those of the great life insurance companies. A running\r\naccount is kept with the treasury to meet the current expenses of the\r\nfund, but all the rest of the money received by it is invested in the\r\nFrench public funds, or in securities guaranteed by the State. No part\r\nof the compound interest received by the fund is deducted to meet the\r\nexpenses of administration. It all goes to the account of the\r\ndepositors, the current expenses being met by the Deposit Fund, which\r\nmanages the Retiring Fund. If at any time before that fixed for his\r\nenjoyment of the retiring pension, the depositor should be made\r\nincapable of work by some illness or accident, he is at once put into\r\npossession, without awaiting the age fixed in the original agreement, of\r\na pension or annuity proportioned to the amount of his actual payments\r\nand to his age at the time when the incapacity is medically and legally\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nEvery year a certain amount is voted by the Chamber as a subvention to\r\nthis fund, and out of this annual appropriation these 'premature\r\npensions' may be increased by the committee in charge of the fund. This\r\nis a sort of practical State socialism beyond a doubt. But it is at\r\nleast as respectable as the expenditure made in this year's budget of\r\n6,500,000 francs, or about one fifth of the whole amount of the French\r\nnaval pension list, on annuities of indemnification 'to the victims of\r\nthe _coup d'état_ of 1851,' the _coup d'état_ of 1851 having been simply\r\na collision between the Legislature of that year, trying to suppress the\r\nExecutive, with the Executive trying to suppress the Legislature, with\r\nthe result that the Executive carried the day, and that the French\r\npeople, by an overwhelming majority, approved the victory of the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nWhy the socialistic principles at the bottom of the National Retiring\r\nFund for workmen should not be extended to others than working-men it is\r\nnot easy to see. The French pension-list is now very heavy. It figures\r\nin this year's budget at nearly a hundred millions of francs, exclusive\r\nof the military and naval pensions, which amount to about one hundred\r\nand twenty-five millions more, and without counting the _débits de\r\ntabac_, which are in fact a kind of pensions used freely by deputies and\r\nother functionaries of influence to reward services of all sorts. Of\r\nthese about two hundred were given away in 1888, the list filling five\r\npages of the huge reports of the Finance Ministry.\r\n\r\nThe National Retiring Fund for Old Age is managed by a high committee of\r\nsixteen, which must include two deputies, two state councillors, two\r\npresidents of mutual aid societies, and one manufacturer. Workmen who\r\nchoose to avail themselves of the fund may break off and renew their\r\npayments into it as they like, and increase or diminish the amount of\r\ntheir annual deposits without affecting by any interruption the value of\r\ntheir previously acquired interest in the fund. Deposits may be made in\r\nthe name of any person at or after the age of three years, so that a\r\nfather may in this way, if he likes, form a small property for his\r\nchildren. The authorisation of the father, however, is not required to\r\nvalidate deposits made in the name or for the benefit of a child, unless\r\nthese deposits are made by the children themselves, in which case they\r\nmerely show the authority of their parents as guardians until they have\r\nattained the age of sixteen. Married women may make deposits\r\nindependently of their husbands, but unless these deposits are gifts to\r\nthem, they are held to be equally the property of the husband and wife\r\nwhere these are not legally separated. In case of the absence either of\r\nthe husband or of the wife for more than a year, a justice of the peace\r\nmay authorise the deposit of money to the exclusive benefit of the\r\npartner on the spot. Deposits of one franc are received from one person,\r\nbut in no case can one person deposit more than one thousand francs a\r\nyear. The capital deposited may be alienated to the fund or reserved. In\r\nthe latter case the capital may be returned, but without interest, to\r\nthe representatives of the depositor in case of death. Any reserved\r\ncapital may be alienated for the purpose of increasing the income at a\r\ncertain age, to be named by the depositor when he signs the alienation.\r\n\r\nThe pension incomes are guaranteed by the State. They become payable at\r\nany full year of age selected by the depositor between fifty and\r\nsixty-five years. After sixty-five the pension-income is paid to the\r\ndepositor from and after the first quarter-day following the deposit. Up\r\nto 360 francs the pension-incomes are not liable to be seized for debt.\r\nIf they accrue from a capital presented to the depositor the donor may\r\nhave them declared unsellable to their full amount.\r\n\r\nFunds deposited in the National Sayings Bank may be transferred in\r\nwhole, or in part, to the National Retiring Fund for Old Age.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions of this fund an annual alienated deposit of 10\r\nfrancs, begun at the age of thirty years, will secure the depositor at\r\nfifty an annuity of 28 fr. 62 c., at fifty-five of 47 fr. 89 c., at\r\nsixty of 81 fr. 43 c., and at sixty-five of 145 fr. 97 c.\r\n\r\nThe regulations adopted by the Anzin Council in 1886 are intended to\r\nduplicate the results of this system of the National Retiring Fund for\r\nthe benefit of any workman who chooses to make himself a depositor in\r\nthe National Fund to the amount of 1-1/2 per cent. of his annual wages.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, a miner earning 1,500 francs a year chooses to\r\ndeposit in the National Retiring Fund 22 fr. 50 c. a year. Upon\r\nverification of this the Anzin Company will pay into the same fund for\r\nhim annually an equal sum. This would give the miner who began his\r\ndeposit of 22 fr. 50 c. a year at the age of thirty, a pension-income at\r\nthe age of fifty of 128 fr. 74 c., or just about the pension-income\r\nwhich he would draw at the age of sixty-five from the National Fund if\r\nhe began a payment of 10 francs a year into that fund at the age of\r\nthirty-two. A miner who began his annual deposit of 22 fr. 50 c. in the\r\nNational Fund at the age of twenty-one, taking advantage then of the\r\nregulations of the Anzin Council, would enjoy at fifty a pension-income\r\nof very nearly 250 francs a year.\r\n\r\nUnder the Anzin regulations, the two payments made by and for the\r\nworkmen concerned are inscribed in an individual bank-book which becomes\r\nhis property. The sums paid in by the company are alienated, and to the\r\nexclusive advantage of the workman, while he is left at liberty to\r\nalienate or reserve his own payments. If he is married, of course his\r\npersonal payments are held to be made one-half for the benefit of his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nIn the case of subterranean miners, the company will begin to carry out\r\nthis system as soon as they enter its service, and without regard to\r\ntheir nationality. In the case of the surface workmen, they must be\r\neighteen years of age, and must have been in the service of the company\r\nfor at least three years without interruption. The reasons for the\r\ndifference are obvious.\r\n\r\nThe payments of the company cease at fifty years, but the workman is\r\nnot obliged to draw his pension-income then, as by continuing his\r\npersonal payments he can put it off, thereby increasing it until he\r\nattains the age of 55, 60, or 65.\r\n\r\nTo meet the case of miners drawn into the army, the company, as long as\r\nthe miner so drawn and returning to its service shall remain in its\r\nservice, will pay in fractions, and within a period equal to that of his\r\nmilitary service, into the National Fund for his benefit a sum equal to\r\nthe percentage he would himself have paid into the National Fund upon\r\nhis wages, calculating them as being the same during the period of his\r\nmilitary service that they would have been had he remained there at work\r\nin the mine.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a workman who falls ill or is injured, the company, if he\r\nis a member of a mutual aid society, which will make his personal\r\npercentage payments for him, will pay itself an equal sum during his\r\nillness or incapacity for at least one calendar year. After that each\r\ncase must be separately dealt with.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, and in addition to these general conditions, the company\r\nwill grant to workmen long in its service, who shall have made their\r\nregular payments to the National Retiring Fund under these regulations,\r\nwhen they give up work, supplementary pensions calculated at the rate of\r\n3 francs a year for fifteen years of service for the miners, and of 1\r\nfr. 50 c. a year for fifteen years for the surface workmen. These\r\nsupplementary pensions are doubled for married workmen, so that they may\r\namount to 90 francs a year for miners, and to 45 francs a year for\r\nsurface workmen.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think the miners of Anzin knew what they were about when\r\nthey stood aloof from the 'strike' in the Pas-de-Calais. To do this was\r\nto aid the 'strikers' themselves much more effectually than by joining\r\nin the strike. For surely the spectacle of such an orderly prosperity as\r\nexists at Anzin, the result of equitable relations maintained for years\r\nbetween Capital and Labour, is the strongest possible argument in\r\nsupport of the reasonable demands of Labour. But what are the reasonable\r\ndemands of Labour?\r\n\r\nIt appeared from an inquiry made by the 'Society of Mineral Industries'\r\nafter the great strike of 1883, that, out of ten coal-producing\r\ncompanies in the North of France which maintained Assistance Funds for\r\nthe miners, the Anzin Company alone did this entirely at the expense of\r\nthe company. The nine other companies reported a joint revenue of\r\n821,133 francs in 1882 for these Assistance Funds, of which amount the\r\nworkmen furnished 603,097 francs. The outlay for 1882 exceeded the\r\nrevenues and amounted to 849,839 fr. 49 c. But, in addition to the\r\n603,097 francs furnished by the workmen to these funds, the nine\r\ncompanies in question expended themselves, in pensions, medical service,\r\nschool subventions, free fuel, hospitals and other contributions to the\r\nwelfare of these 32,849 miners and workmen, no less than 2,942,694 fr.\r\n91 c. So that while the workmen expended on an average 3 per cent. of\r\ntheir wages in maintaining Assistance Funds, these nine companies\r\n(excluding Anzin, where no demand was made on the workmen) expended for\r\nthe benefit of the workmen and their families an amount equal to 9 per\r\ncent. of the wages paid by them, and to 24 per cent. of the interest and\r\ndividends paid to the stockholders. On the average the companies thus\r\nspent about 50 c. for every ton of coal extracted.\r\n\r\nCould labour reasonably demand more than this of capital?\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of deputies like MM. Basly and Camélinet, backed\r\nby the revolutionary press of Paris, the miners in another part of\r\nFrance, at Decazeville, went on 'strike' in January 1888. They began by\r\nbrutally murdering M. Watrin, one of the best managers in the country.\r\nThey kept the whole region idle and in terror for three months and a\r\nhalf. They inflicted great loss on the company and disturbed all the\r\nindustries of France. They themselves lost 630,427 francs of wages. The\r\ncompany finally granted an increase of wages representing only 1-1/2 per\r\ncent. of the wages sacrificed by the strike. The Municipal Council of\r\nParis, which had fomented the strike, magnificently gave the miners\r\n10,000 francs of money which did not belong to them. All the Radical\r\npress together subscribed 70,000 more. The Decazeville charities gave\r\n2,231! And the next year all the miners testified that they had been\r\nquite content with the wages before the strike, and gave a banquet to\r\nthe chief engineer!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nIN THE NORD--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n  LILLE\r\n\r\nThanks to Louis XIV., French Flanders became politically French more\r\nthan two centuries ago. But it still remains essentially Flemish. The\r\nland has a life and a language of its own, like Brittany or Alsace. The\r\nFrench Fleming is rarely as haughty in his assertion of his nationality\r\nas the French Breton; but when a _Monsieur de Paris_, or any other outer\r\nbarbarian, comes upon a genuine _Flamand flamingant_, there is no more\r\nto be made of him than of a _Breton bretonnant_, standing calmly at bay\r\nin a furrow of his field, or of the bride of Peter Wilkins enveloped in\r\nher graundee.\r\n\r\nEven in the great and busy cities of Lille and Roubaix, the Flemish\r\ntongue holds its own against the French with astonishing pertinacity.\r\nBut if French Flanders is still more Flemish than French, the Flemings,\r\nI believe, are very good Frenchmen, just as I imagine the most\r\nenthusiastic Welshmen of Mr. Gladstone's beloved little principality,\r\nwould be, after all, found, at a pinch, to be very good Englishmen.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, their ancient Flemish capital, Lille, now the chief\r\ntown of the great Department of the Nord, is decidedly more French than\r\nFlemish.\r\n\r\nThe seven sieges it has sustained have left it quite bare of great\r\nhistoric monuments, and during the past thirty years millions of francs\r\nhave been spent upon its streets, squares, and boulevards, with the\r\nresult of giving it the commonplace and comfortable look of a growing\r\nquarter of Paris. Its famous old walls have been improved off the face\r\nof the earth; and I am glad to say that few if any of the noisome\r\ncellars seem still to exist in which, when I first knew the place, not\r\nso very long ago, thousands of its industrious working people used to\r\ndwell like troglodytes.\r\n\r\nMarlborough's cannon spared the fine seventeenth-century Spanish Lonja,\r\nand there are traces still to be discerned about the modernised mairie\r\nof the ancient palace of Jean Sans Peur and Charles the Fifth. But there\r\nis no Flemish building here comparable with the Hôtel de Ville and the\r\nBeffroi of Douai. Of old Flemish customs and traditions, however, there\r\nis no lack in Lille, and I came upon a curious proof of the vitality of\r\nits local patriotism. This was the regular publication, in the most\r\nwidely circulated morning newspaper, of a series of carefully prepared\r\narticles on the archæology and antiquities, the legends and the archives\r\nof the old Flemish capital. One of the editors of this journal showed me\r\nin his office a collection of these articles, reprinted from the\r\nnewspaper, and now filling some twenty volumes.\r\n\r\nI spent my first midsummer morning at Lille in the Musée which has been\r\ninstalled in the Hôtel de Ville. The Wicar collection of drawings there,\r\nI need hardly say, is of itself a 'liberal education' in art. During his\r\nlong residence at Rome in the Via del Vantaggio, the Chevalier\r\nJean-Baptiste Wicar wasted neither his time nor his money. What\r\ntreasures were then to be picked up by such a man--for Wicar died not\r\nlong after the Revolution of July 1830! Where he found his Masaccios,\r\nRobert Browning told me that he knew; but where did he find that\r\nincomparable bust in wax which charms with all the mystic feminine grace\r\nand more than all the feminine beauty of the Mona Lisa? Possibly M.\r\nCarolus Duran may be able to throw light upon this; for he was one of\r\nthe earliest beneficiaries who profited by the fund which the Chevalier\r\nWicar founded for the purpose, as he says in his will, of 'giving to\r\nyoung men, natives of Lille, who devote themselves to the fine arts, the\r\nmeans of sojourning at Rome for four years, under certain conditions.'\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier Wicar was a good Catholic, and he gave to his fund the\r\ntitle of the 'pious foundation of Wicar.'\r\n\r\nI suppose that under the Third Republic this monstrous recognition of an\r\nunscientific emotion would have sufficed to vitiate the scheme, in which\r\ncase France would have lost the artistic achievements of M. Carolus\r\nDuran.\r\n\r\nThe house in the Via del Vantaggio I believe still makes a part of the\r\n'pious foundation,' and the municipality of Lille has very sensibly\r\nadded a yearly sum of 800 francs to the 1,600 francs allotted under the\r\nwill of the Chevalier Wicar to each beneficiary, together with a\r\ntravelling outfit of 300 francs.\r\n\r\nComing back from the Musée to breakfast in my very comfortable hotel\r\nnear the _gare_, I found there awaiting me M. Grimbert of Douai, who had\r\nmost obligingly come over to show me what the friends of religion and of\r\nliberty are doing in Lille to prove that the religious sentiment is not\r\n'dead' in this part of France, and that the Christians of French\r\nFlanders do not intend to let their children be 'laicised' into the\r\nlikeness of M. Jules Ferry and M. Paul Bert, without an effort to\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\nThe Department of the Nord has long been conspicuous in France for the\r\nnumber and the excellence of its educational institutions. The\r\nstatistics collected by M. Baudrillart show that it stands side by side,\r\nin this respect, with the Department of the Seine. Of the 663 communes\r\nwhich make up the Department of the Nord, only three in 1881 were\r\nwithout a school. The department contains 1,680,784 inhabitants. Of\r\nthese, considerably more than one-third, or 680,951, live in the 17\r\ncantons and 129 communes of the arrondissement of Lille, which includes\r\nof course the city, and here we find 340 public schools, 1,038 classes\r\nfor instruction, and 116 free educational establishments. Over against\r\nthis organisation of education must be set a very notable development of\r\nintemperance. I do not infer this from the extraordinary amount of\r\nbeer-drinking which goes on in the Nord, to the extent, according to M.\r\nBaudrillart, of 220 bottles a year to every man, woman, and child in the\r\ndepartment, against 170 in the Ardennes and 153 in the Pas-de-Calais.\r\nFor, after all, it may be doubted whether habitual drunkenness is much\r\nmore common in beer-drinking than in wine-drinking countries; and there\r\ncan be no question, I think, that it is much less common in countries in\r\nwhich wine is abundant and cheap, than in countries in which wine is an\r\nimported luxury. But the consumption of alcoholic liquors is apparently\r\non the increase in this great department.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this century, long before Lille and Roubaix had\r\nbegun to draw into their factories such great numbers of the rural\r\npopulation as now yearly throng into these prosperous cities, a prefect\r\nof the department, M. Dieudonné, declared that it was not an unusual\r\nthing to see workmen in Lille who worked only three days in the week and\r\nspent the other four in drinking corn brandy and Hollands gin. At that\r\ntime the workpeople of the sister city of Roubaix had a much better\r\nreputation, while of the rural populations of French Flanders Dr.\r\nVillermé then affirmed, after a careful study of their habits, that\r\nnothing was to be seen among them of the 'debauchery and the daily and\r\ndisgusting drunkenness prevalent in the large towns.'\r\n\r\nPersons familiar with the rural aspects of the Nord assure me that this\r\ncan no longer be said with truth of the rural farm-labourers. It is,\r\nprobably, more true of the farmers and of their families than it was\r\nfifty years ago, but it is, unfortunately, also less true than it then\r\nwas of the rural labourers. The number of small cabarets has quadrupled\r\nduring the last quarter of a century in the arrondissement of Douai\r\nalone, which contains 6 cantons, 66 communes, and 131,278 inhabitants,\r\nthe majority of them occupied in agriculture; and, taking the whole\r\ndepartment, it appears that the consumption of spirits represents an\r\nincrease of 100 per cent. in the average consumption of pure alcohol in\r\nthe last forty years. It rose from 2.52 litres, in 1849, for every man,\r\nwoman, and child, to 4.65 litres, in 1869, and it is now estimated to\r\nreach 6 litres, which would represent an annual consumption of about 16\r\nbottles of brandy at 42 degrees, for every man, woman, and child in the\r\ndepartment. I did not happen to see any drunken women or children in the\r\ndepartment, but M. Jules Simon, in his work, _L'Ouvrière_, gives an\r\nuncanny account of feminine drunkenness at Lille, where there are\r\nspecial cabarets, it seems, for women. I believe no special estaminets\r\nhave yet been set up there for women addicted to tobacco, and, indeed, I\r\ndo not know that the civilisation of French Flanders has yet reached the\r\npoint of treating the question 'whether women ought to smoke' as a\r\npractical question, worthy the grave attention of savants and\r\nphilosophers. Possibly, if England, like France, had enjoyed the\r\nadvantage of sixteen changes in her form of government, and of three\r\nsuccessful foreign invasions, during the past century, questions of this\r\nsort might now subtend no greater an arc in England than they now\r\nsubtend in France. And it certainly ought to interest Englishmen to know\r\nthat the example of England is freely cited in Lille, Roubaix,\r\nTourcoing, and other centres of Flemish life and activity, to support\r\nthe 'noble and military' amusement of cock-fighting, to which the good\r\npeople of these regions are extraordinarily addicted. A law was passed\r\nagainst this practice under the presidency of Prince Louis Napoleon in\r\n1850, and many attempts have since been made to suppress it--but with\r\nsmall success. A Republican prefect of the Nord, some years ago,\r\nactually wrote to the President of the Society for the Prevention of\r\nCruelty to Animals that he would not hesitate to 'enforce the provisions\r\nof the law against cock-fighting whenever the practice seemed to be\r\nlikely to become too general!' I do not know that I ever stumbled on a\r\nmore delightful recognition of the Eleventh Commandment of demagogism,\r\n'_vox populi vox Dei_!' Naturally, with such encouragement as this, the\r\nsport of late years has been assuming, I am told, a recognised place\r\namong the amusements of the people. Fighting-cocks go into the arena as\r\nchampions of the towns in which their owners dwell; and if the feathered\r\nAchilles of Roubaix does the feathered Hector of Tourcoing to death, the\r\nspectators not unfrequently take up the quarrel, divide into two camps,\r\nand have it out handsomely on the spot. These things I note because they\r\ntend to show how difficult it is to develop an ideal civilisation in a\r\nfew years by the simple process of forbidding men to teach, or to\r\nbelieve in, the existence of a Divine Ruler of the Universe.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, and without unduly dwelling upon it, I may here\r\nrecord the statement made to me by an editor of an influential journal\r\nin Lille, that in no city in France has the evil of juvenile\r\nprostitution taken such root as here. When I expressed my surprise at\r\nthis, the French law as to the _détournement de mineures_ being at least\r\nas stringent as the English, he replied: 'How can you expect such a law\r\nto be enforced under this Government?' and he then went on to show me in\r\nan old file of his journal an account, now some years old, of the\r\nadventures of a deputy from Versailles in the Palais Royal at Paris.\r\n'Our Republicans,' he said, 'are firm believers in the great principle\r\nof the solidarity of all the party with all the haps and mishaps of\r\nevery member of the party.'\r\n\r\nA more confirmed pessimist, by the way, than this journalist I have not\r\nseen in France. He was quite convinced that the Republicans would show a\r\nmajority in the seven circumscriptions or districts of Lille at the\r\nelections in the autumn, and he criticised very severely the attitude of\r\nthe Catholics at Lille in regard to politics. 'They are excellent\r\npeople,' he said, 'but they think too much of the souls of the people\r\nand not enough of their votes.'\r\n\r\nI ventured to suggest that perhaps the picture which he had himself set\r\nbefore me of the moral condition of the city of Lille, at least, might\r\nbe thought to afford some excuse for this preoccupation of the Catholics\r\nwith the spiritual rather than the political interests of the people.\r\n\r\nBut to this he would not listen for a moment.\r\n\r\n'No, no!' he said; 'the first thing to be done for the souls of the\r\npeople is to get rid of these fellows at Paris! Are they not paganizing\r\nthe country? Here is this new law which is demoralising the army. Why do\r\nthey wish to force the seminarists into the service? Is it not avowedly\r\nbecause they think this will stop the recruiting for the ranks of the\r\nclergy? Why are they attacking the foundations of the magistracy? Is it\r\nnot because the French magistrates stand between them and the rights of\r\nthe French clergy as French citizens? How far off are we from a revival\r\nof Danton's beautiful doctrine that, in order to consummate the\r\nregeneration of society, all conditions imposed upon the eligibility of\r\ncitizens to act as judges ought to be immediately abolished, so that a\r\ntinker, or a butcher, or a bootblack, or a chiffonnier might be made a\r\nFrench magistrate just as well as a trained student of the laws? As you\r\nknow, one of the first things Danton, as Minister of Justice, did was to\r\ncarry through the Convention his famous decree making this doctrine law\r\nin France!\r\n\r\n'I am worn out,' he said, 'with trying to make our good people here\r\nunderstand that they must go into the battle-field of politics and put\r\nthese fellows out of power at Paris if they mean to prevent France from\r\nfalling into absolute anarchy once more. I cannot make them move, and I\r\nbelieve we shall be beaten in all the seven districts of Lille.'\r\n\r\nI am glad to say the event proved that my pessimistic friend was by far\r\ntoo pessimistic. Of the seven seats to which the arrondissement of Lille\r\nis entitled, four were carried by the Monarchists--in two cases without\r\nan attempt seriously to contest them; and if the seven candidates had\r\nbeen voted for on a single list, that list would have been elected by\r\nthe arrondissement.\r\n\r\nThe Monarchists threw in the whole arrondissement 53,135 votes, the\r\nOpportunist Republicans 31,019, the Radicals 9,191, and the Socialists\r\n1,011. So that the Monarchists had a clear majority of 11,814 votes over\r\nall the factions of the Republican party put together. In one district\r\nof Lille, the 1st, the Boulangists threw 4,376 votes. If we put these\r\ndown, which we have no right to do, as Republican votes, the Monarchists\r\nstill show a clear majority of 7,438 in the whole arrondissement of\r\nLille, and, as I have said, if the representation of France by\r\narrondissements were really a representation by arrondissements and not\r\nby circumscriptions, the seven hundred thousand people of this great and\r\nprosperous department of North-Eastern France would now be represented\r\nat Paris not by four Monarchists and three Republicans, but by seven\r\nMonarchists. This may serve to show how exceedingly unsafe it is to\r\nassume that the nominal party complexion of the majority in a Chamber\r\nelected as the present French Chamber has been really gives foreign\r\nobservers anything like an accurate notion of the state of public\r\nopinion and the drift of popular feeling in France at this time.\r\n\r\nA friend to whom I am indebted for an analysis made with great care of\r\nthe electoral results, not in this very important department alone, but\r\nthroughout France, points out to me the exceedingly significant\r\ndifference between the majorities given to the Monarchists and to the\r\nRepublican deputies. In the 4th District of Lille, for example, M. des\r\nRotours, the Monarchist candidate, received 10,555 votes, being the\r\nlargest poll by far given to any candidate in the whole arrondissement,\r\nand not one vote was thrown against him. In the 6th District the\r\nRepublican candidate was declared to be elected by no more than 199\r\nmajority in a total poll of 14,833 votes. In the 3rd District the\r\nMonarchist was elected by a majority of 1,441 votes, in a total poll of\r\n16,081 votes. In the 5th District the Republican was returned by a\r\nmajority of 281 votes in a total poll of 15,321 votes. In the 7th\r\nDistrict the Monarchist was returned by a majority of 237 in a total\r\npoll of 14,463 votes. In the 1st District of Hazebrouck the Monarchist\r\nwas returned by a majority of 6,861, in a total poll of 11,129 votes,\r\nand in the 2nd District of Hazebrouck by a majority of 5,269 in a total\r\npoll of 10,291!\r\n\r\nHazebrouck is an essentially Flemish town of some 10,000 inhabitants,\r\nand the arrondissement, which comprises 7 cantons and 53 communes,\r\ncontains 112,921 inhabitants, is absolutely Flemish. The early\r\nsixteenth-century church of St.-Nicholas at Hazebrouck, with its lofty\r\nand graceful spire, was begun about the time of the first voyage of\r\nColumbus, and is one of the most beautiful extant Flemish buildings of\r\nthat time. The people of this arrondissement and their neighbours in the\r\narrondissement of Dunkirk were almost as famous before 1789 as the Dutch\r\nfor their skill as florists and their success in developing all manner\r\nof eccentric varieties of roses, tulips, primroses, and pinks. I do not\r\nknow that they ever managed to produce a blue rose, but they came very\r\nnear it, and at the present time their rich and level country is gay\r\nwith cottage gardens. They are given to sociability also, for the\r\narrondissement possesses, I am told, at least one cabaret for every 70\r\ninhabitants. But then the cabarets in the department at large average 1\r\nto every 61 inhabitants, and in the thoroughly agricultural\r\narrondissement of Avesnes they number 1 for every 38 inhabitants. In the\r\narrondissement of Avesnes, a property of from five to twenty hectares is\r\ncalled a small farm. In the arrondissement of Hazebrouck, a farmer\r\ncultivating from six to fifty hectares passes for an agriculturist of\r\nthe middle class. The people are prosperous, and their hostility to the\r\nRepublic seems to have its origin chiefly in the intolerance and\r\nextravagance of the Government. This is the case too, apparently, with\r\ntheir neighbours in the arrondissement of Dunkirk. The 1st District of\r\nDunkirk elected a Boulangist Revisionist by a solid vote of 7,821\r\nagainst 4,806 votes, given not to a Government Republican but to a\r\nRadical, while the 2nd District of Dunkirk elected a Monarchist by a\r\nmajority of 5,036 votes in a poll of 11,168.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such figures as these it seems to me that the friends of\r\nreligion and of liberty in the Department of the Nord hardly merit the\r\nreproach put upon them by my pessimistic journalist at Lille of\r\nlukewarmness in the political battle of 1889.\r\n\r\nNeither he nor any one can well accuse them of lukewarmness in any other\r\nmatter affecting the interests either of religion or of liberty. And I\r\ncannot help hoping that my Northern pessimist may perhaps have\r\nover-estimated the prevalence of juvenile prostitution in Lille as much\r\nas he certainly underestimated the devotion of the Monarchists of Lille\r\nto their political flag. His gloomy prognostications as to the issue at\r\nthe polls were probably enough inspired by his thorough knowledge of the\r\nextraordinary preparations made by the authorities for manipulating the\r\nreturns. On this point he gave me some particulars which appear to be\r\nborne out by subsequent events. It is curious for example to learn from\r\nthe analytical table to which I have already referred in connection with\r\nthe elections at Lille, that of the 164 Government candidates returned\r\nas elected at the first balloting of September 23, 87 were returned as\r\nelected by majorities of less than 1,000 votes, while of the 147\r\nMonarchists returned as elected on the same day, only 48 were returned\r\nas elected by majorities of less than 1,000 votes. Of the 164\r\nRepublicans, 20, or about one in eight, were returned as elected by\r\nmajorities of less than 200 votes; while of the 147 Monarchists, only\r\n11, or about one in thirteen, were returned as elected by similar\r\nmajorities. When we remember that the machinery of these elections was\r\nabsolutely controlled by the prefects under instructions from M.\r\nConstans, the Minister of the Interior, which were not made public,\r\nthis circumstance is certainly very significant. Some of the details\r\nsent me by my analytical correspondent make it still more significant.\r\nIn the 2nd District of St.-Nazaire, for example, the Monarchist\r\ncandidate was elected without a competitor, receiving 16,084 votes. In\r\nthe 1st District of St.-Nazaire the Government candidate was returned by\r\na majority of no more than 6 votes, the returns giving him 8,458 votes\r\nto 8,452 for his Monarchist opponent. This margin is almost as\r\nsuggestive as the majority of 9 votes by which M. Razimbaud, a\r\nGovernment candidate for the district of St.-Pars, in the Department of\r\nthe Hérault, was declared three days after the balloting of October 6 to\r\nhave been returned over his Monarchist opponent, the Baron André Reille.\r\nIn this same Department of the Hérault, the Prefect and the\r\nCouncillors-General returned M. Ménard-Dorian, the Government candidate,\r\nas elected, at Lodève, over M. Leroy-Beaulieu, the distinguished\r\npolitical economist, by a majority of 67 votes. In this case it seems a\r\ncertain number of votes thrown in one commune for both candidates were\r\nset aside, to be annulled for informality. When the returns went up to\r\nthe Council for revision, the informal votes cast for M. Leroy-Beaulieu\r\nwere declared invalid, the informal votes cast for M. Ménard-Dorian were\r\ndeclared good and valid, and M. Ménard-Dorian was proclaimed to have\r\nbeen elected. The Committee of the Chamber reported against the seating\r\nof M. Ménard-Dorian, and tried to have this report accepted, but as I\r\nwrite the Chamber has not accepted it, and the odds are that M.\r\nLeroy-Beaulieu, who, though a Moderate Republican, has made himself\r\nobnoxious to the Government by telling the truth about the financial\r\ncondition of France, will be kept out of the seat which it is tolerably\r\nplain that he was elected to fill.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for an Englishman, even for an American, to understand\r\nthe cynical coolness with which things of this sort are done in the\r\nFrench Republic of the present time, and not very easy to understand the\r\napathetic way in which, when done, they are accepted by the French\r\npublic. There seems to be little doubt that in England of late years\r\nballot-boxes have been 'stuffed' only by the stupidity of the voters,\r\nand not by the ingenious rascality of the political managers. I wish I\r\ncould with an easy conscience say the same thing of my own country. But\r\neven in the United States deliberate tampering with the returns of a\r\npolitical election has not, I think, been practised since the evil days\r\nof Reconstruction at the South with the calm disregard of appearances\r\nshown by the Government managers during the legislative contest of this\r\nyear, 1889, in France; and certainly there has been nothing known in the\r\nCongress of the United States, since the days of Reconstruction, at all\r\ncomparable with the systematic invalidation by the majority in the\r\nFrench Chamber of the elections of troublesome members since it\r\nassembled on November 12. In the cases of General Boulanger and of M.\r\nNaquet, the latter of whom resigned his seat in the Senate to stand as a\r\nBoulangist candidate for the Chamber, this invalidation was carried out\r\nopenly as a party measure and precisely in the spirit of the famous or\r\ninfamous resolution which Robespierre made the 'Section of the Pikes'\r\nadopt, to the effect that the electors of Paris must be protected\r\nagainst their own incapacity to choose 'true patriots' by having the\r\n'true patriots' chosen for them. If this be one of the 'principles of\r\n1789,' it must be admitted that the Third Republic is consistently and\r\ncourageously acting upon it. It has undoubted advantages, but it has a\r\ntendency, perhaps, to put in question the value of what are commonly\r\ncalled representative institutions. Strike out of the theory of\r\nrepresentative institutions the right divine of the people to choose the\r\nwrong men, and what is left of it?\r\n\r\nAt the close of the election of September 22, 1889, in Paris, the major\r\nof the 2nd or Clignancourt District of the eighteenth arrondissement of\r\nthe Department of the Seine declared that General Boulanger had received\r\n7,816 votes out of 13,611 cast, and that he was therefore elected. Of\r\nhis competitors, one M. Joffrin, described as a 'Possibilist,' had\r\nreceived 5,507 votes; M. Jules Roques, a Socialist, had received 359\r\nvotes, and for a citizen bearing the gloomy but respectable name of M.\r\nCercueil, or 'M. Coffin,' one vote had been cast. Obviously General\r\nBoulanger was the man whom a majority of the voters of Clignancourt\r\ndesired to represent them. If General Boulanger for their own sake could\r\nnot be allowed to represent them, why not M. Cercueil? They certainly\r\ndid not choose M. Cercueil to represent them. But as certainly they did\r\nnot choose M. Joffrin to represent them.\r\n\r\nWhat really happened? The Prefect of the Seine, on hearing the result at\r\nClignancourt, notified the Minister of the Interior, and orders were at\r\nonce given to correct this egregious error into which the voters of\r\nClignancourt had fallen as to what their true interest required. It was\r\nprobably found that an 'informality' had occurred in certain communes,\r\nand that through this 2,494 votes must be annulled. News of this\r\ndiscovery was instantly sent to the Parisian newspapers. As it was\r\nsupposed that they would give M. Joffrin a plurality of the votes to be\r\nrecognised, sundry newspapers actually printed the name of M. Joffrin at\r\nthe head of the list of candidates in the place usually accorded by a\r\nreally enlightened press to the elect of universal suffrage.\r\nUnfortunately the official calculator is not of the blood of Bidder. It\r\nwas found at the last moment that enough votes had not been 'annulled'\r\nto put M. Joffrin at the head of the poll, so that his name actually\r\nappears in sundry Parisian morning papers of September 23, first indeed\r\nin position, but over against it are recorded 5,500 votes, while the\r\nname of General Boulanger comes second with 5,880 votes! Clearly an\r\nawkwardness! In the _Journal des Débats_, which is a serious Republican\r\njournal of character, the election of General Boulanger by 7,816 votes\r\nwas quietly announced, with a postscript to the effect that 'the\r\nPrefecture of the Seine' gave a different result, 'arising from the\r\ncircumstance that in certain sections 2,494 votes bearing the name of\r\nGeneral Boulanger had been asserted to be null and void,' and that,\r\ntherefore, there would be a second election, or 'ballottage,' on October\r\n6!\r\n\r\nThere could hardly be a more pregnant commentary than this upon the\r\ncandid admission made by the most respectable and influential Republican\r\njournal in Paris, the _Temps_, on October 17, 1885, that these 'second\r\nelections,' or 'ballottages,' are simply a device by which the Central\r\nGovernment at Paris is enabled to 'correct' the errors perpetrated by\r\nthe voters of France at the elections which precede them. 'To learn the\r\ntrue sentiments of the country,' said the _Temps_, 'we must consult the\r\nelections of the 4th. On that day _universal suffrage was allowed_ to\r\nchoose freely between the opposing parties and policies. The vote of\r\nto-morrow will not be as clear and precise, for it will be determined by\r\n_tactical necessities and by all sorts of combinations_.'\r\n\r\nPerfectly true! But, this being true, what becomes of 'popular\r\nsovereignty' and of the divine quality of the rights derived from\r\nuniversal suffrage as contrasted with rights derived from inheritance,\r\nor, for that matter, with rights derived from a dice-box or the\r\nshuffling of a pack of cards? Considering what the usual origin is of\r\n'tactical necessities' in politics, and what forces determine political\r\n'combinations of all sorts,' is it going too far to say that the odds,\r\nso far as public interests are concerned, are in favour of the dice-box\r\nor the pack of cards--provided the dice be not loaded or the cards\r\nspecially packed?\r\n\r\nSome years ago, in my own country, a well-known Austrian dined with me\r\none night, just before he sailed for Europe after a tour in the United\r\nStates. We spoke of a public man just then filling a very responsible\r\nposition at Washington, to which he had been named after a severely\r\ncontested and very costly election. 'I thought him a very pleasant,\r\nintelligent man,' said my Austrian guest, 'but it struck me that you\r\nspend too much time and trouble and money on getting just such men into\r\nsuch places. We get very much the same calibre of men for the same kind\r\nof work much more economically and easily by the simple process of\r\nmarrying a prince to a princess.'\r\n\r\nWhat I have seen and learned this year of the working of the electoral\r\nmachinery in France under the Third Republic inclines me, as I have\r\nalready said, to think that the Catholic children of light in Lille and\r\nin French Flanders generally may be doing better work both for Religion\r\nand for Liberty than my pessimistic journalist was disposed before the\r\nelections to believe. If they had given more time and thought and money\r\nto 'tactical necessities' and 'political combinations,' and less to the\r\nsocial and spiritual interests of the land in which they live, the\r\nresults even of the elections might perhaps have been less satisfactory\r\nto them. For, as I have shown, the strength of the Monarchist vote in\r\nthis region proved to be much greater than my pessimist thought it\r\nwould be; and the Republicans of the Third Republic did a deal of\r\ncanvassing for the Monarchists by making it very hard for men who love\r\nreligion and liberty to vote for Republican candidates.\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield's saying, that the world is governed by the people of\r\nwhom it hears the least, is certainly not less true of the Catholic\r\nChurch than it is of the world. The Catholic stock in French Flanders is\r\nas vigorous and full of sap as in Belgium or in Holland. It is\r\ninteresting to hear educated people talking glibly in London or Paris\r\nabout the decay of the Christian religion in the same breath in which\r\nthey profess their unbounded admiration of the heroism of Father Damien.\r\nIt was through no act or wish of Father Damien that the world at large\r\ncame to know his name, or to take account of a work which was done not\r\nto be seen of men. He was simply a Flemish Catholic, doing what he\r\nbelieved to be the will of God.\r\n\r\nThroughout the broad rich plains of the great Department of the Nord,\r\nand in its crowded busy towns and cities, this Catholic faith is\r\neverywhere to be seen and felt--to be felt rather than to be seen in its\r\nfruits of charity, self-denial, and devout self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nNowhere in France is public charity, I am told, so extensively and\r\nefficiently organised, and the demands upon public charity are\r\nexceptionally great. The department is very rich and very prosperous,\r\nbut it contains, like all frontier regions, a large floating population;\r\nand one of the best-informed men I met in Lille, a large landed\r\nproprietor in one of the wealthiest communes of the department, told me\r\nthat there are probably more families or tribes of hereditary mendicants\r\nscattered over French Flanders than are to be found in any other French\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThese are not nomads addicted to wandering off into other regions, but\r\nrather a kind of Northern lazzaroni. They do a little work occasionally,\r\nbut as little and as seldom as possible. They are inveterate poachers,\r\nand the more industrious of them are habitual smugglers. In their way of\r\nprosecuting this industry, however, they show their fine natural\r\ninstinct for avoiding labour. The most profitable trade they drive is in\r\ntobacco. This they get over the frontier from Belgium, and to get it\r\nthey train a certain breed of dogs. They tie parcels of tobacco around\r\nthe throats of these dogs, and then proceed to have the dogs well\r\nthrashed by one of their number dressed in the Custom-house uniform. A\r\nfew lessons of this sort suffice to develop in the dogs a strong\r\nassociation of ideas between the odour of tobacco and the thwacks of a\r\ncudgel, and a dog well educated in this way may be trusted, after he has\r\ngot his cargo in Belgium, to reach his master's den unvisited by the\r\nFrench _douane_. Baudrillart confirms this account. He puts the number\r\nof habitual applicants, largely from this mendicant class, for public\r\nrelief in the department at from two hundred to two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand a year. Out of the 662 communes in the department there were\r\nonly twenty in 1888 without a 'Bureau de Bienfaisance,' and the\r\ndepartment spends five millions of francs a year on its charities,\r\nindependently of nearly twice that amount expended upon hospitals,\r\nasylums, dispensaries, and the like, by private benevolence. Under the\r\nFrench law, private donors can found charities to be attached to the\r\npublic 'Bureau de Bienfaisance,' and administered by the public\r\nofficers, and one of the many evil effects of the war declared against\r\nCatholic France by the Third Republic is that it affects such charities\r\nvery seriously.\r\n\r\nEven under the Empire trouble came of the occasional division of one\r\ncommune into two or more communes, a question then arising as, for\r\nexample, in a famous case of the communes of St.-Joseph and St.-Martin\r\nin the Loire, about the division between the poor of the two communes of\r\nthree hospital beds left to the 'Bureau de Bienfaisance' of the original\r\ncommune of St.-Martin. It was easier for the military saint himself to\r\ndivide his cloak with the shivering beggar than for the commune which\r\nbore his name to divide three beds into two equal portions! At Lille,\r\ntwo or three years ago, a lady, Mme. Austin Laurand, the widow of M.\r\nLaurand, in accordance with her husband's will, gave 30,000 francs to\r\nthe 'Bureau de Bienfaisance' of the city, the income thereof to be\r\napplied, under the supervision of three commissioners, to encouraging\r\nhabits of thrift among the apprentices of Lille. Two hundred bank-books\r\nof five francs each are annually given to apprentices in the first two\r\nyears of their apprenticeship, and the rest of the income is to be given\r\nin prizes each year to those of the bank-book holders who shall be shown\r\nto have been the most careful and thrifty in managing the results of\r\ntheir labour during the year.\r\n\r\nA law passed in 1874, before the 'true Republicans' of Gambetta and\r\nFerry came into power, provides for a medical inspection and record of\r\nnewly-born children, and this law puts infants, whenever it may be found\r\nnecessary, under proper hygienic conditions. It has been nowhere so\r\nenergetically carried out as in the Nord. Of course, such a law as this\r\nflies directly in the face of the great gospel of the 'survival of the\r\nfittest.' But though that gospel was introduced to Paris on the stage as\r\none of the curiosities of the Centennial Exposition of 1889, it has made\r\nlittle progress as yet in Catholic France. Even at the theatres in\r\nParis, I am glad to say, the popular instinct still regulates the\r\n_queue_ on principles quite inconsistent with the Darwinian maxims of\r\n'every man for himself,' and 'the devil take the hindmost.' It will be\r\nan evil day for invalids and cripples bitten with the drama when the\r\n'struggle for life' comes to be logically developed into the right of\r\nthe strongest men to get first to the ticket office!\r\n\r\nThroughout the Department of the Nord, primary schools exist for the\r\nchildren who are taken in charge at their birth by public benevolence,\r\nand those to whom they are confided are obliged to see that the children\r\nattend these schools from the age of six to the age of twelve years.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the Church acting upon the naturally sociable and\r\ngregarious temperament of the Flemish race, mutual aid societies have\r\nbecome very numerous of late years in the Nord. A hundred and fifty-two\r\nsuch societies now exist in the arrondissement of Lille alone. These\r\nnumbered, in 1888, 7,249 honorary members and 35,270 paying members, and\r\ntheir assets were stated at about 3,000,000 francs. Only 3,649 women,\r\nhowever, were enrolled on their lists. Is this a confirmation, I wonder,\r\nof the theory entertained by Mr. Emerson and other philosophers, that\r\nwoman is not a 'clubbable' animal?\r\n\r\nPutting this aside, however, for the moment as a more or less 'academic'\r\nquestion, it is of interest to note the very considerable development\r\nduring the last few years of the principle of association among the\r\nworking-men and producers of France, under the influence of the Church\r\nand of Conservative public men like M. Welche, one of the\r\nextra-parliamentary Ministers of the Marshal-Duke of Magenta, who did\r\ngood service here at Lille as Prefect of the Department of the Nord, and\r\nwho has made the French law of 1881 affecting 'professional\r\nsyndicates,' so useful throughout the agricultural world of France.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the organic statutes of the Society of 'Foreseers of the\r\nFuture,' or 'Prévoyants de l'Avenir,' that all political and religious\r\ndiscussions are forbidden at the meetings of the society.'\r\n\r\nThis society was established at Paris on December 12, 1880. On February\r\n23, 1881, it was authorised to act as a 'Civil Society,' by the Minister\r\nof the Interior and the Prefect of Police. Its object is to 'ensure to\r\nall its members who shall have co-operated in maintaining it for twenty\r\nyears, the first necessaries of life.' I shall not attempt here to go in\r\ndetail into the statutes and organisation of the society. Suffice it to\r\nsay that the statutes are brief, clear, and sensible, and that the\r\norganisation appears to be eminently practical. The members, to the\r\nnumber of whom no limit is set, the only indispensable condition being\r\nthat they shall be in good health and actively employed in some trade or\r\ncalling, pay an entrance fee of two francs, and a monthly due of one\r\nfranc. This monthly due must be paid in advance, and a fine of 25\r\ncentimes is imposed for every month in arrears. Each member receives a\r\nbook containing the statutes, which establishes his title to its\r\nbenefits, and for which he pays 50 centimes. Donations may be received,\r\nand under the authority of the officers entertainments may be given, the\r\nprofits of which go to the general fund. Any respectable person, no\r\nmatter what may be his calling, may become a member, if he has attained\r\nthe age of fifteen years, and women are not excluded. 'Having the same\r\nduties,' say the statutes, 'they have the same rights,' but, despite\r\nthis, it is provided that women who are members shall not be fined if\r\nthey fail to attend the general meeting on the second Sunday in January\r\nin each year, whereas men in the same case shall be mulcted in the sum\r\nof one franc, unless they shall have previously by letter excused\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nEvery member at the expiration of twenty full years of membership shall\r\nbe entitled to his share of the interest earned during the twentieth\r\nyear of his membership by the property of the society, the funds of\r\nwhich can only be invested in the three or five per cent. funds of the\r\nFrench nation. His regular contribution to the society will still go on,\r\nbut he will receive his share of the interest earned thereafter\r\nregularly every three months. Should a pensioner die, the year's\r\ninterest due to him shall be paid over to his heirs or assigns. The\r\npension cannot be transferred or alienated, and the relations of a\r\npensioner have no claim upon the amount of the payments made by him to\r\nthe society. Should a member become an invalid, incapable of work, after\r\nfully paying up his dues to the society during five years, he may demand\r\nto be kept upon the books as a full member, and as such he will be\r\nentitled to his pension at the end of twenty years. The society can only\r\nbe dissolved by a unanimous vote of the members at a general meeting;\r\nand if so dissolved the members must choose another society as nearly as\r\npossible resembling this, to which the property of the dissolved society\r\nshall be transferred.\r\n\r\nThe funds for current expenses of the society can never exceed 1,500\r\nfrancs. This society, as I have said, was founded in 1880. Its success\r\nhas been really phenomenal.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1882, it comprised 757 members, and its capital amounted\r\nto 6,237 francs. On January 18, 1886, it consisted of 15,008 members,\r\nand had a capital invested in French consols of 361,003 fr. 99 c. On\r\nApril 1, 1889, it numbered 59,932 members, divided into 340 sections,\r\nand it possessed an invested capital of 1,541,868 fr. 26 c.! Of course\r\nthe Tontine principle enters into the system, and it would be\r\ninteresting to compute the probable pensions in 1902 of so many of the\r\n757 persons who were members of the society in 1882 as may then be\r\nliving to claim their share of the interest then earned by the then\r\ncapital of the society. The minuteness, precision, and practical common\r\nsense with which the statutes of this organisation have been drawn up\r\nand provision made in its regulations against all the probable\r\ndifficulties to be encountered in carrying it on, gives one a very\r\nfavourable notion of the business capacity and of the character of the\r\nFrench working classes. No conditions as to sex or nationality are\r\nimposed upon membership, the only necessary qualification being that the\r\nperson applying to be admitted shall be actively employed in some way,\r\nbe domiciled in France, and be sixteen full years of age. It strikes me\r\nthat organisations of this sort are more likely to promote a practical\r\nsolution of the Labour question than combinations to secure the passage\r\nof laws fixing the number of hours for which a man shall be allowed to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe Church has taken an active part in fostering the development of\r\nthese mutual aid societies throughout this great department, and\r\nparticularly in Lille and Roubaix. The disasters of the Franco-German\r\nwar gave a great impulse to them. These disasters did more to strengthen\r\nand deepen than all the vulgar violence of the pseudo-scientific and\r\npseudo-literary atheism of parliamentary Paris has yet done to weaken\r\nthe religious sentiment in France, and the French Catholics cannot be\r\ncited to illustrate Aubrey de Vere's noble saying that 'worse than\r\nwasted weal is wasted woe.'\r\n\r\nI spent a most interesting morning at Lille with M. Grimbert in visiting\r\nthe buildings and the collections of the great Catholic University which\r\nhas been founded here to meet the assault of M. Ferry and his allies on\r\nthe higher education in France. This Catholic University has been\r\nendowed and is maintained entirely by the private liberality of the\r\nCatholics of the Department of the Nord, and by the revenues it derives\r\nfrom the students who attend its courses. It is a thoroughly equipped\r\nuniversity of the first rank. The Rector, Monseigneur Baunard, is a\r\nRoman prelate, and of the two vice-rectors, one is a prelate and the\r\nother a canon. These, with the Deans of the Faculties, and five\r\nprofessors elected from the corps of instructors, constitute the\r\nAcademic Senate. The Administrative Council comprises the Archbishop of\r\nCambrai, the Bishop of Arras (to the benevolence of one of whose\r\npredecessors France is indebted for the education which enabled\r\nRobespierre to avenge upon the Church and upon his country what in one\r\nof his letters he calls 'the intolerable slavery of an obligation\r\nreceived'), the Bishop of Lydda, the Chancellor of the University, and\r\nthe Rector. The Theological Faculty comprises a dean and nine\r\nprofessors; the Law Faculty a dean, the Comte de Vareilles-Sommières,\r\nand thirteen professors. One of these gentlemen, M. Arthaut, was so kind\r\nas to receive M. Grimbert and myself, and to show us over the whole\r\ninstitution. The Medical Faculty comprises a dean, Dr. Desplats, and\r\ntwenty-three professors; the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, a dean,\r\nDr. Margerie, and seven professors; the Faculty of Sciences, a dean, Dr.\r\nChautard, and nine professors.\r\n\r\nThe buildings of the University now occupy two sides of an immense\r\nsquare in one of the finest quarters of Lille, and when fully completed\r\nwill occupy the whole square. As they now stand they are by far the\r\nmost striking edifices in Lille, and would do honour to any city in\r\nEurope. The area covered by them, I should say, is larger than that\r\ncovered by the University of London, and certainly, from the\r\narchitectural point of view, they need fear no comparison with the\r\nLondon establishment. The library, which is admirably arranged, already\r\ncontains about 80,000 volumes, and the apparatus of the scientific\r\nschools is admittedly better than that of any institution in France. The\r\noutlay already made here exceeds 11,000,000 fr., or about 240,000_l._\r\nsterling, all of which has been contributed freely by the Catholics of\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\nOn the face of things it appears to me that the existence of this\r\nUniversity is somewhat inconsistent with the notion that 'the religious\r\nsentiment is dead in France.' The classes are now attended by between\r\nfour and five hundred students, for whose accommodation three 'family\r\nhouses' have been already built, in which students are lodged at an\r\nexpense of from 1,000 to 1,400 fr. a year, and when the academic\r\nbuildings now in process of construction are completed, more than a\r\nthousand students can be thus lodged. Two dispensaries, a Maternity\r\nHospital, under the charge of Sisters of Charity of St.-Vincent de Paul,\r\ntogether with the large Hospital de la Charité, are directly connected\r\nwith the clinical service of the medical faculty, and are so\r\nadministered as to render the most important services to the industrious\r\npopulation of the city. The Electrical Department of the Faculty of\r\nSciences is particularly well equipped, and one of the assistants in\r\ncharge of this department, who showed us some improvements recently\r\ndevised here in the working apparatus, surprised me by the extent and\r\nminute accuracy of his information as to all the most recent progress\r\nmade in the applications of electricity to machinery, and to the arts on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised, however, to learn from M. Arthaut that the\r\nastonishing prosperity of this great institution is viewed with extreme\r\ndissatisfaction by the authorities at Paris, and particularly by the\r\nUniversity of France, which has been confirmed again under the Third\r\nRepublic in the monopoly of academic privileges, of which it was very\r\nsensibly deprived by the Assembly under the Government of the\r\nMarshal-Duke of Magenta. By way of expressing this dissatisfaction with\r\ndignity and emphasis, the Government of the Third Republic actually\r\nforbids free Catholic universities to use the title of universities. M.\r\nFerry's Article 7 not being yet law in this best of all possible French\r\nRepublics, Catholics cannot be prevented from spending their own money\r\nin founding institutions which are really universities. But, at all\r\nevents, they can be forbidden to give any one of them the title of a\r\nuniversity, that being reserved for the State establishment, which, from\r\nParis, extends its academic sway all over France.\r\n\r\nI called the attention of M. Arthaut to the fact that a great Catholic\r\nUniversity has been this year founded in the capital of the Republic of\r\nthe United States, and that the President of the Republic, himself a\r\nProtestant, not only attended the ceremonies of the foundation, but made\r\na brief speech, in which he expressed his best wishes for its progress\r\nand prosperity. 'That, I am afraid,' said M. Arthaut, 'is a kind of\r\nrepublic which we are not likely to see established in France.'\r\n\r\nTo measure the significance of this Catholic work in behalf of liberty\r\nand religion here at Lille, it must be borne in mind that the very men\r\nwho are building it up with such splendid liberality and enterprise are\r\ncompelled by the iniquitous laws of the Third Republic to bear their own\r\nshare as taxpayers in supporting here at Lille another academic\r\ninstitution of a similar scope, but of less importance, under the direct\r\ncontrol of the University of France, from all share in the\r\nadministration of which religion and the ministers of religion are as\r\nrigidly excluded as that refugee of the First French Revolution, Stephen\r\nGirard, intended they should be from the college which he founded at\r\nPhiladelphia. Of course the same thing is true of the Catholics all over\r\nFrance. Out of their pockets must come nine-tenths of the enormous sum,\r\nas yet quite incalculable, but certainly running far up in the hundreds\r\nof millions of francs which is still to be expended by the Third\r\nRepublic upon its 'scholastic palace,' and the ever-increasing army of\r\n'lay teachers,' male and female, whom it is yearly turning out of the\r\neducational institutions of France to seek the employment which a vast\r\nmajority of them cannot possibly hope to find in the public schools, the\r\nlyceums and 'faculties' of the nation.\r\n\r\nOn this point a Councillor-General whom I met here at Lille dwelt with\r\nvery grave emphasis. 'We are educating here in France,' he said to me,\r\n'hundreds of young men and young women every year under false pretences\r\nto enter a profession already overcrowded. For every post which now\r\nexists or which can be created within the next ten years in the\r\neducational system of these revolutionists at Paris, we are turning out\r\nat least a hundred applicants each year of each sex, who must\r\nnecessarily be thrown upon the public. What will become of them? The\r\nyoung men will go into Nihilism, as young men of the same sort do in\r\nRussia; the young women will go upon the street. Only the other day at\r\nParis, the Government advertised a competition for about 70 positions in\r\nthe telegraphic service. How many young women applied? More than 800!\r\nWhat is to become of the 730 unsuccessful competitors? And what right\r\nhas the State to flood the market thus, in advance of the necessities of\r\nthe country, and at the cost of the taxpayers, with male and female\r\nteachers, any more than with carpenters, or with surgeons, or with\r\nconfectioners?'\r\n\r\nOne circumstance connected with the development of this great Catholic\r\nUniversity at Lille (as an American I permit myself to give the\r\ninstitution its proper title) is of special significance. It is not the\r\nonly institution of the kind which has been called into existence in\r\nFrance since the Third Republic began its war against religion in 1880.\r\nThere is a Free Catholic institution at Lyons, which consists of three\r\nfaculties under the administration of a company founded to receive and\r\nadminister all sums given or bequeathed to organise the institutes. The\r\nArchbishop of Lyons is Chancellor of this institution, which has a dean\r\nand seven professors of theology, a dean and eighteen professors of law,\r\nwith a secretary and librarian of that faculty, a dean and seven\r\nprofessors of letters, a dean and nine professors of science. There are\r\nsimilar institutions also at Angers and at Toulouse. All of these are\r\nfreely supported by the private subscriptions of Catholic France, as is\r\nalso the great Catholic Institute of Paris in the Rue Vaugirard, so\r\nadmirably conducted by Monseigneur d'Hulst, the Vicar-General of Paris.\r\nThanks to the law of July 12, 1875, and to the stand made by the friends\r\nof liberty and religion when the law of March 18, 1880, was finally\r\nenacted, the students of the Faculty of Law in these Catholic institutes\r\nstill have the right to present themselves with the certificates of\r\ntheir several institutes at the public examinations for the diplomas of\r\nthe baccalaureate, the licentiate and the doctorate in law, and for the\r\ncertificate of capacity in the law, necessary to enable the successful\r\ncandidates to practise the legal profession in France. To maintain the\r\nefficiency of the free Catholic institutions, the Catholics of France\r\nhave spared during the last few years neither labour nor money. More\r\nthan 17,000,000 francs have been contributed during that period to\r\nestablish the Catholic educational system in Paris alone, and more than\r\n2,000,000 francs are yearly subscribed there to keep it up. As I have\r\nalready said, the University here at Lille represents an expenditure\r\nduring the same period of more than 11,000,000 francs and a still larger\r\nprospective expenditure.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting, if it were possible, to learn how much out of\r\ntheir own pockets the propagandists of unbelief have expended during\r\nthis same decade upon the irreligious education of the children of their\r\ncountrymen! Were the truth attainable, the amount expended by them would\r\nbe found to bear to the amount received by them from their propaganda of\r\nunbelief much less than the proportion of Falstaff's 'pennyworth of\r\nbread' to his 'intolerable deal of sack!' While the Catholics of France\r\nhave been giving millions to defend the right of the French people to\r\nprotect the faith of their children, these men have been expending\r\nhundreds of millions of the money of Catholic taxpayers upon school\r\nbuildings, the contracts for erecting which have been controlled by\r\nthemselves for their friends; they have been finding places in the\r\npublic educational service for their friends, dependants and allies, and\r\nthey have been comfortably drawing large salaries themselves from the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nSet over against these incontrovertible facts, the fact, as\r\nincontrovertible, for which I am indebted here to M. Grimbert, that of\r\nthe millions expended in defence of liberty and religion here at Lille,\r\na very large proportion has been contributed by one single Catholic\r\ncitizen of this ancient Flemish city, who has consecrated his life and\r\nhis fortune to his faith in the spirit of the earliest Christian times,\r\nand I think my readers will agree with me, not only that the religious\r\nsentiment is not dead in France, but that it never was more living and\r\nmore active in France, nor more full of promise for the social and\r\npolitical regeneration of this great people.\r\n\r\nI shall not run the risk of offending this good Catholic by naming him,\r\nthough his name and his work are an open secret for every intelligent\r\nperson in Lille. Suffice it that, coming of an old Flemish stock and\r\nbearing an old Flemish name, this citizen (the title of citizen means\r\nsomething respectable in these staunch old free cities) of Lille years\r\nago insisted to his brother, who was his associate in the ownership and\r\nmanagement of one of the largest commercial houses of this region, that\r\nthey should take regularly into the partnership account of their\r\nbusiness, for one-third of their annual profits, 'the work of God.' This\r\nwas done; and from that day to this the proportion thus set apart of\r\ntheir profits has been regularly devoted to the service of the Church\r\nand of charity. But this is not all. The brother, of whom I speak with\r\nthe reticence and the reverence due to a type of character not\r\nabsolutely common in this age of the Golden Calf, has systematically\r\nlimited his own personal expenses during the whole of these years to a\r\nfew thousands of francs, devoting all the rest of his income to\r\nreligious and benevolent objects.\r\n\r\nI should really like to see a calm business-like estimate made of the\r\neconomical advantages likely to result to a country from extinguishing\r\nat an expense of several hundreds of millions of francs a year the faith\r\nwhich gives birth to characters such as this.\r\n\r\nI visited, in one of the suburbs of Lille, the extensive manufactories\r\nof another well-known house, the heads of which have worked out and\r\nestablished an excellent system of 'mutual assistance' among their\r\nemployees, and built up a large and well-ordered _cité ouvrière_ on a\r\nplan substantially resembling that of those which I saw at St.-Gobain\r\nand at Anzin. A house for young girls established by this firm, very\r\nnear their main factory, struck me as particularly admirable. It is\r\nunder the management of the Sisters of St.-Vincent de Paul, who fill the\r\nplace with a pervading spirit of cheerfulness and animation, quite\r\nindescribable. The dormitories were the perfection of neatness. The\r\ngymnastic hall and the grounds were in apple-pie order, and as the lower\r\npart of the large and airy building erected by the firm for this\r\ndomicile is used during the day as a kind of crèche by the married women\r\nwho leave their young children here while they are busy in the factory,\r\nthe whole place was alive with merry and laughing little imps. I heard\r\nof other establishments of the same kind at and near Roubaix on a still\r\nlarger scale. These I unfortunately had not time to visit. Under the\r\nEmpire in 1865 a few energetic citizens of Lille induced the\r\nmunicipality to guarantee five per cent, interest on a capital of\r\n2,000,000 francs for the establishment of a company to construct, let\r\nand sell houses for working-men under certain conditions as to the\r\nisolation of each house and as to its proper ventilation and drainage.\r\nThe rental of these houses can never exceed eight per cent, on the cost\r\nof erection, those of one story never to cost more than 2,400 francs,\r\nand those of two stories more than 3,000 francs, including the cost of\r\nthe land. The houses are built of brick with foundations and sills of\r\nSoignies stone. These were the original statutes, but the company is now\r\nallowed to build single-story houses on a larger scale with cellars,\r\nwhich may be rented for 400 francs a year or bought for 5,000 francs--a\r\nfirst payment in the case of purchase to be made of 500 francs, and\r\nafter that the money to be paid in instalments of 40 francs a month over\r\nthirteen years. All the wells and pumps are supplied by the\r\nmunicipality.\r\n\r\nThe municipality also makes an annual grant in aid of a very useful\r\ncharity, founded under the Empire, and largely developed by private\r\ngifts and legacies, called the 'Invalids of Labour.' This now secures\r\npensions to nearly a hundred workmen, disabled by serious accidents\r\nincurred in their labour or through some effort to help others in peril.\r\nIt also gives temporary assistance in less severe cases. But the most\r\ncharacteristic institution which I found flourishing at Lille has a\r\nhistory worth telling. It strikingly illustrates the development under\r\nthe old _régime_ in France and Flanders of those public works of\r\nbenevolence of which we are so often and so audaciously asked to believe\r\nthat they had no existence before the benign 'principles of 1789'\r\nbedewed the hearts of men, and it not less strikingly illustrates the\r\ndemoralising and destructive influence upon all manner of sound and\r\nuseful establishments throughout France of the headlong and reckless\r\nadministration of public affairs by the successive 'governments' of the\r\nFirst Republic.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1607, on September 27, a worthy Catholic citizen,\r\nBartholomew Masurel, _bourgeois et manant_ of the city of Lille, came\r\nbefore two notaries, and declared 'that to succour the poor people of\r\nLille in their necessities, and also for the salvation of his own soul\r\nand the souls of his predecessors and successors, he wished to establish\r\na _Mont-de-Piété_, where money loans should be made without usury or\r\ninterest, and not as they were made by the Lombards.'\r\n\r\nTo this end Bartholomew Masurel gave, by a donation between living\r\npersons, and irrevocable, to take effect after his death, all his lands,\r\nfiefs, and houses which he owned at Lille, and in his country place, and\r\nthe value of which might be estimated at a hundred and fifty thousand\r\n_livres parisis_, or in money of our day nominally 300,000 francs. In\r\nfact, the gift, I am told, represented about half a million francs of\r\nour days.\r\n\r\nBut the good '_bourgeois et manant_' could not hold out till his death\r\nagainst the appeal which the sight of 'the poor people of Lille in their\r\nnecessities' daily made to his kindly heart. So in 1609 he agreed with\r\nthe Mayor, that he would turn over all these possessions at once to the\r\nmagistrates to be applied to the purpose he meant to effect, the\r\nmagistrates agreeing to secure to him an annuity out of the funds of the\r\ncity of 1,200 florins, or about 1,562 francs of our time. Thereupon he\r\nwent to work with the authorities to found his charity. From his\r\nstatutes we learn that foundations of this kind were then common in\r\nFrench Flanders. He models them, as he says, upon 'those of similar\r\nfoundations in our neighbouring towns and elsewhere.'\r\n\r\nNo loans were to be made except to '_manants et habitants de la Ville\r\nTaille et Banlieue de Lille_,' and only to 'poor and necessitous persons\r\nwho, not being able to gain their livelihood, were forced to borrow\r\nmoney;' nor were loans to be made to 'persons prodigal, of evil life,\r\nand accustomed to squander their goods.' For this due order was to be\r\ntaken by the magistrates. At first the loans were limited to 24 florins\r\n(30 francs) to one person; the lowest sum loaned being 20 patars, or 1\r\nfr. 25 c. of our times. So well had Bartholomew Masurel organised his\r\ncharity, and so many good Christian souls swelled its funds by gifts and\r\nbequests, that within a year the maximum loan was raised to 50 florins,\r\nin 1669 to 100 florins, and in 1745 it was fixed at 120 florins, or 150\r\nfrancs. At this figure it stood when the First Republic began its\r\nexperiments. The fund was then known as 'the true Mont-de-Piété,' and\r\nwas carried on under letters patent granted in 1609 by the Archduke\r\nAlbert of Austria. When Lille became French in 1667, Louis XIV had to\r\nrecognise and confirm all the rights and titles of this benevolent\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIt had rendered great service to the industries of Lille during the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the growth of the funds enabling\r\nthe managers to lend sums to weavers on their goods when trade fell off,\r\nand so relieving them from the necessity of parting with them for less\r\nthan their value. Just before the Revolution the Masurel Fund amounted\r\nto 455,454 francs, of which 256,627 francs were in cash or in loans, and\r\nthe rest in state funds and houses, yielding a revenue of 8,307 francs.\r\n\r\nOn January 23, 1794, the National Convention coolly ordered that all\r\n'objects of necessity deposited in any Mont-de-Piété for an amount not\r\nexceeding 20 francs should be at once restored without payment to their\r\nowners, and all such objects deposited for amounts below 50 and above 20\r\nfrancs on payment, without interest, of the amount beyond 20 francs!'\r\n\r\nThis 'liberal' legislation had been preceded on August 24, 1793, by\r\nanother act of spoliation which ordered 'the payment of the capital of\r\nall sums at interest to be made in _assignats_, and the conversion of\r\nall the debts of the Communes, and of the suppressed public\r\norganisations throughout France into State debts.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these measures the whole property of the Masurel fund\r\nwas found in 1803, when Napoleon began to overhaul the chaos to which\r\nthe lunatics and plunderers of the Republic had reduced France, to\r\namount to no more than 10,408 francs in real estate. This was the way in\r\nwhich the 'principles of 1789' developed the benevolent institutions of\r\nFrance, and introduced a new era!\r\n\r\nThe authorities of Lille had the good sense and forecast thereupon to\r\nsuspend the operations of the true _Mont-de-Piété_, and to set about\r\nrestoring the fund as far and as fast as was possible. The Christian\r\ninstitution of Masurel had fared better than the 'Lombards.' This latter\r\nestablishment had to be formally closed in 1796, as it was then found to\r\nhave no more than 86,000 francs in its treasury, and this in\r\n_assignats_!\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Prefect of the Nord reported that the Masurel fund might be\r\nsafely devoted anew to the purposes of its founder. It then amounted to\r\n249,644 fr. By an imperial decree of 1860, all that remained of the\r\nproperty of the 'Lombards' was amalgamated with the Masurel fund, and\r\nthe institution was put under the direction of the official\r\nMont-de-Piété of Lille, but with a separate system of accounts, and\r\nbegan its operations again on the lines laid down by its founder in\r\n1607. It has since worked so well that the maximum of the loans\r\nreimbursable, without interest, has risen from 30 francs in 1860 to 200\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, the maximum being 100 francs, the number of engagements and\r\nrenewals was 10,933--the money loaned amounted to 75,460 fr. 50 c., in\r\nloans averaging 9fr. 14 c., and the capital of the fund to 257,231 fr.\r\n27 c. In 1888, the maximum being 200 fr., there were 16,000 engagements\r\nand renewals, the loans amounted to 136,663 francs in average loans of\r\n8 fr. 54 c., and the capital of the fund to 334,726 fr. 57 c.\r\n\r\nOf the 'similar foundations in other towns' which moved the pious\r\nemulation of Bartholomew Masurel nearly three centuries ago, how many, I\r\nwonder, still exist!\r\n\r\nAnd with them how many other monuments of the Christian civilisation of\r\nFlanders and of France were 'improved' off the face of the earth by the\r\n'regenerators' of 1792?\r\n\r\nIt was not by accident that I learned of the Masurel Mont-de-Piété; but\r\nwhen I went to the Municipal Secretary to ask him for some official\r\naccount of its condition and its operation, that courteous functionary\r\nlooked at me for a moment with astonishment and then said, 'I am\r\ndelighted to give you what you want, and I assure you that, with one\r\nexception, you are the only foreigner who has ever asked for this\r\ninformation in the last seven years! The other was the English\r\nProtestant clergyman here in Lille, who happens to live or has his\r\nchapel, I am not sure which, just opposite the Mont-de-Piété!'\r\n\r\nI ought not to speak however of the Masurel foundation as 'unique.' I\r\nhope there may be many more men like the good Bartholomew Masurel in our\r\ntime, and in other countries besides France, than we wot of. But the\r\nonly modern institution of a kindred spirit with this of which I have\r\nany present cognisance began its career in England only fifteen years\r\nago, and was founded curiously enough like the Masurel fund by men of\r\nthe Low Countries. This is the 'Koning Willem's Fonds,' of the\r\nNetherlands Benevolent Society of London. At a dinner given at the\r\nCannon Street Hotel on May 12, 1874, to celebrate the twenty-fifth year\r\nof the accession of King William III under the presidency of the Dutch\r\nMinister in England, the Count de Bylandt, the guests in a glow of\r\nloyalty and good-fellowship proposed to raise a contribution to be spent\r\nin the purchase of some handsome memorial of the occasion. A happy\r\ninspiration came to the Chairman, and he suggested to his countrymen\r\nthat the best of all possible memorials of such an occasion would be to\r\nestablish a fund for the relief of poor and worthy Netherlanders in\r\nLondon and to give it the name of their King. The suggestion was adopted\r\nby acclamation, and the result the 'Koning Willem's Fonds,' from which,\r\nas I find by examining its statutes and its records, gratuitous loans,\r\nprecisely identical in their object and under conditions not essentially\r\ndifferent, are made to deserving Hollanders in London.\r\n\r\nThe 'fonds' is connected with a society doing the usual work of all such\r\nforeign benevolent societies in London. But it is a special fund, and as\r\nI learn from the Annual Report of the Society for January 1889, it has\r\nso far been administered with entire success, and with the result of\r\nenabling not a few honest and industrious Hollanders stranded in London\r\nto make a fair and prosperous start in life. That the fund is\r\nadministered in the true practical spirit of the old Low Country\r\nbenevolence, and its advantages appreciated as they ought to be, appears\r\nfrom the statement made by the Treasurer, Mr. Maas, in the Report for\r\n1889, that the number of loans is increasing and the number of donations\r\ndecreasing. In 1888 371_l._ were loaned as against 185_l._ in 1887, and\r\n247_l._ given away as against 382_l._ in 1887. I observe, too, that the\r\nLord Mayor of London, Sir Polydore de Keyser, gave at this annual\r\nmeeting as his reason for joining the society which administers this\r\nfund that it had the courage to spend 251_l._ in excess of its assured\r\nincome rather than send away the good which came to its door to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIN THE MARNE\r\n\r\n\r\n  REIMS\r\n\r\nNo city in France has more to lose and less to gain from the triumph of\r\nthe Third Republic over historic France than this ancient, rich, and\r\nroyal city of Reims.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the Third Republic on the lines laid down by M.\r\nChallemel-Lacour in 1874 and re-affirmed at the elections of 1889, means\r\nthe extinction of the religious sentiment in France. To extinguish the\r\nreligious sentiment in France would be to empty the history of Reims of\r\nall its significance. It would be to filch from the city of St.-Rémi and\r\nof Clovis, of Urban II. and of Jeanne d'Arc, its great name--a robbery\r\nthat surely would not enrich the Third Republic, but that would leave\r\nReims poor indeed!\r\n\r\nOf course it is possible that the laicised, unbaptized, and atheistic\r\nFrench citizen of the future may come to regard the hegira of M.\r\nGambetta from Paris to Tours in a balloon, and the occupation of Tonkin,\r\nas events of greater importance to mankind than the creation of France\r\nby Clotilde and Clovis, or the rescue of France from conquest and\r\ndismemberment by the pious peasant-girl of Domrémy, or the rolling back\r\nof Islam from the domination of the world by Urban II. Heaven forbid\r\nthat I should assume to set any limit to the things which a truly\r\nscientific unbeliever is likely to believe!\r\n\r\nBut while men still abide in the thick darkness of the Catholic faith,\r\nor even in the penumbral twilight of Protestant Christianity, I do not\r\nsee how Reims is to be one bit the better, materially or morally, for\r\nthe extinction of the religious sentiment in France.\r\n\r\nThe arrondissement of Reims contains very nearly 200,000 people, of whom\r\nconsiderably more than one-third inhabit the city itself. A very large\r\nproportion of these are employed in the numerous factories which\r\nflourish here, and many more in the various industries connected with\r\nthe incessantly growing commerce in those sparkling wines which have\r\nmade the name of this ancient province synonymous with luxury and gaiety\r\nin the remotest corners of the world. Though Épernay is the real\r\nheadquarters of this commerce, two or three of the most important houses\r\nconnected with it are, and long have been, established at Reims, and\r\nsome of the most remarkable of the vast cellars excavated in the chalk,\r\nin which these sparkling wines are stored throughout the Department of\r\nthe Marne, are here to be seen. Here too, at least as well as at Épernay\r\nor Châlons, acquaintance may be made, at the right time and in the right\r\nplaces, with certain vintages of Champagne which seldom or never find\r\ntheir way into the channels of trade, not so much because of their\r\nrarity and high cost as because of their exceeding delicacy. It is\r\nalmost impossible, for example, to find even at Paris the finest quality\r\nof the red _vin de cave_ of Bouzy. This is illustrated by the fact that\r\nthe only samples of this exquisite wine sent to Paris for the Universal\r\nExposition of 1889 were those sent by Bouché Fils at Mareuil-sur-Ay, and\r\nthese represented only three vintages, the earliest being that of 1884.\r\nThe daintily aromatic bouquet of this wine is seldom unaffected even by\r\nthe short railway journey to the capital. Of course I know that by\r\nspeaking of this or of any other still wine of Champagne, I put myself\r\nunder the ban of Mr. Canning's famous declaration, so often cited by\r\nLord Beaconsfield, that 'the man who says he likes still champagne will\r\nsay anything.' Nevertheless what I have written, I have written--and I\r\nshall not take it back. This the less, that I cannot allow myself even\r\nto enter upon this theme of the vineyards of the chalky Marne and the\r\ncellars of Champagne. Were I to do this, I should have a tale to unfold,\r\nmuch too long, and involving too many points of controversy with the\r\naccepted gastronomic authorities in my own country, in England, and in\r\nRussia, to be brought within the compass of this volume. Suffice it that\r\nthe great wine-growers of Champagne do not seem to me to be infidels, or\r\nto neglect the due provision of their own households in their\r\nphilanthropic anxiety to promote the convivial happiness of the four\r\nquarters of the globe. The extent to which the syndication of vineyards\r\nfor the production of the wines most in demand in one or another part of\r\nthe world, has been developed of late years in Champagne is a noteworthy\r\nphenomenon. Not less noteworthy is the growing attention paid throughout\r\nthis Department of the Marne of late years to scientific methods in\r\nagriculture, and the steady improvement in the condition of the rural\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nWhether a similar improvement can be shown in the general condition of\r\nthe urban population is not so clear as might be wished. That within\r\ncertain limits such an improvement has taken place, is however\r\nundeniable; and this is of great interest, because it is distinctly due\r\nto the energy and decision with which the challenge flung down to the\r\nChristianity of this historic Christian heart of France has been taken\r\nup by the Catholics of Reims.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a most interesting visit which I made in August to the\r\nCardinal Archbishop of Reims, His Eminence was good enough to put me in\r\nthe way of measuring for myself the work done among the factory people\r\nof this region by a great Christian organization, the centre and pivot\r\nof which was established here, but which is mow extending itself all\r\nover the country. Most assuredly there is nothing in the story of this\r\nwork to indicate either the approaching death or the decay of the\r\nreligious sentiment in France.\r\n\r\nThis work rests, like all great works, upon certain principles. But\r\nthese principles were worked out, not through any theoretical\r\ninquisition into the possibilities of society, but through a direct\r\npersonal practical experience of the relations between an employer of\r\nlabour and his employees. It is known now throughout France as the work\r\nof the 'Christian Corporations,' and it includes, as a part of its\r\nmachinery, the 'Catholic Workmen's Clubs,' which are increasing and\r\nmultiplying throughout France. Its founder, M. Léon Harmel, is at the\r\nhead of an important manufactory at the Val-des-Bois near Reims. This\r\nmanufactory was established here half a century ago by the father of M.\r\nHarmel, and the great social work which the son is now doing is the\r\ncoming to fruit, after many years, of the virtues and the experience of\r\nhis father. The Ardennes is the northernmost of the four Departments\r\ninto which the wise men of 1790 divided the ancient province of\r\nChampagne, and M. Harmel, the father, had inherited a manufactory in\r\nthat department. This he gave up to his brother, and removing to the\r\nMarne in 1840 he founded here the establishment of the Val-des-Bois. He\r\nwas a devout and sincere Catholic, and he had lived all his life among a\r\nquiet and Catholic population in the Ardennes. He found himself\r\nsurrounded in his new home by a totally different people. His new\r\nemployees were amazed when they saw him attending mass at the parish\r\nchurch on Sunday. A few of their wives and daughters went there\r\nirregularly, but the men, as a rule, were 'total abstainers.'\r\n\r\nM. Harmel made no attempt to preach to his people otherwise than by his\r\nexample. But the employer being regarded, in the light of modern\r\nprogress, as the natural enemy of the employee, this example had little\r\neffect. M. Léon Harmel tells a delightful story of his father's first\r\nsuccess in inducing some of his workmen, with whom he had fallen\r\nincidentally into conversation on the subject, to go over to Reims in\r\nthe early morning at the beginning of Lent, and confess to an excellent\r\npriest there who was one of his friends. He spake with the men\r\nseparately, and said nothing to any one of them of his conversations\r\nwith the others. Meeting one of his converts on his return, M. Harmel\r\nasked him about his experience. 'Ah, sir!' the man replied, 'it is all\r\nvery well, but I shall never be caught there again!' 'And, pray, why\r\nnot?' 'Why I thought I was the only man going to confess. I saw no one\r\nwhen I went into the confessional, and the good priest was very good,\r\nand I was glad I went. But when I came to commune in the church, there\r\nwere three of my comrades! How I looked at them, and how they looked at\r\nme! It will be all over the factory to-night, and we four will have no\r\npeace for six months! No! I shall not do this again!'\r\n\r\nThe manufactory prospered. If the example of M. Harmel availed little\r\nagainst the public sentiment of the workpeople educated in utter\r\nindifference to all religion, in the way of inducing them to attend to\r\ntheir religious duties, his unvarying justice and benevolence, his\r\nreadiness to succour and to advise them in all straits, and his\r\nunobtrusive devotion to his faith, at least exerted a wholesome effect\r\nupon their general conduct; and the factory of the Val-des-Bois earned\r\na high reputation for its freedom from flagrant scandals and disorders.\r\nBut this did not satisfy M. Harmel. After twenty years of single-handed\r\nand uphill work, he determined to seek help. On February 28, 1861, he\r\nestablished three Sisters of St.-Vincent de Paul in a small house which\r\nhad been a wayside inn, and set about Christianising his people in\r\nearnest. There was no pomp or parade about the matter. The good Sisters\r\nwere quite content to establish an asylum for the little children in\r\nwhat had been the stable of the inn, and to open their school in two\r\nlittle upper chambers. Two Jesuit Fathers came and devoted a month to a\r\nregular mission. Processions were organised and lectures given, some in\r\nthe factory, others at the little inn. The novelty of the enterprise\r\nexcited the attention of the people, and when a decided movement at last\r\nof interest in the mission made itself clearly felt, M. Harmel took\r\nadvantage of it, with the help of the Sisters, to form Christian\r\nassociations, first among the young girls, then among the young men, and\r\nthen among the workmen themselves. The first young girl who gave an\r\neffectual impulse to the work, was a girl selected by the Sisters, with\r\ntheir usual sound instinct, because they found her capable of absolute\r\ndevotion to a not by any means estimable mother, and to a decidedly\r\nreprehensible sister. She was a peasant-girl, brought up in a disorderly\r\nfamily, by no means choice or refined in her language; but the Sisters,\r\nfor whom she conceived a great affection, saw that she was generous,\r\nfearless, and determined, and that was enough.\r\n\r\nWith the girls, with the young men, with the workmen, no sort of direct\r\nor indirect pressure was ever for a moment employed. The associations\r\nwhich they formed were managed by themselves, M. Harmel, the priest whom\r\nhe finally brought to Val-des-Bois, and for whom he built a chapel, and\r\nthe missionary brethren, giving advice and aid only when and as it was\r\nasked. One excellent workman, who had been in the factory for many\r\nyears, and who was much esteemed by M. Harmel, was asked one day by the\r\npriest why he had never taken any interest in the religious\r\nassociations. 'I do take an interest in them,' he replied, 'and they are\r\ndoing a great deal of good. I don't feel moved to join them, but I do\r\nthem a great service often. Many a time in the cabarets I hear a man\r\nsay, \"Oh, the papa Harmel is a good man, no doubt; they are right to\r\ncall him there 'the good father.' He is all that, but nobody can get any\r\nwork there unless he is a little saint!\" Then I get up and say, \"Don't\r\ntalk like a fool! You see me; I have worked for 'the good father'\r\nthirty-five years. I have never done my religious duties, but nobody\r\ntreats me the worse for that! That shuts them up!\"'\r\n\r\nOne great obstacle, at the outset, to the success of these associations,\r\nout of which the 'Christian Corporations' were eventually to grow, was\r\nthe hostility of the elder married women to the 'Enfans de Marie,' and\r\nthe other societies of young girls. They objected that these societies\r\nbroke up the Sunday balls, and when they were asked whether these Sunday\r\nballs did not lead to a good many scandals, they replied, 'Oh, young\r\npeople must amuse themselves; we used to amuse ourselves!' They insisted\r\ntoo, that the girls would neglect their home duties to attend mass and\r\nthe meetings of their new societies. One particularly recalcitrant dame\r\nmade her husband's life a burden to him, because he not only encouraged\r\nhis daughters in going to the Sisters, but actually went to mass\r\nhimself. Finally, one day the poor man came to see the Sisters. He was\r\nevidently much exercised in his mind, and showing the Sisters a small\r\nsum of money he had, he said, 'I have saved this up to bring my old\r\nwoman to a better mind, and I want you to help me.' They asked him how.\r\n'Why, you see, all the trouble comes because she don't know you, and\r\nwon't know you, and thinks everything wrong about you. Now if one of you\r\nwill just take this money, and buy her a new Sunday gown, and take it to\r\nher as if it was a gift you wanted to make her, that will bring her all\r\nright, I know, and we shall have peace in the house!'\r\n\r\nWhat Sister could resist such an appeal? The pious fraud was\r\nperpetrated, and the worthy dame gave way along the whole line!\r\n\r\nThis working population of Val-des-Bois, when M. Harmel began his work\r\namong them, it will be seen, was a fair type of the average working\r\npopulations of France in those parts of France where the influence of\r\nRadicalism has been most potent, and the influence of the Church\r\nweakest. There is another factory in the same commune now. There are\r\nsixteen others within a radius of three French leagues, and the city of\r\nReims, with its population of nearly a hundred thousand souls, is within\r\nhalf an hour of the place. All the disturbing currents of socialism, of\r\nagrarianism, of indifferentism play about and upon the place constantly.\r\nThe Sunday ball is an institution still. The influence of the local\r\nauthorities during the last ten years has been thrown against the\r\nCatholic associations, and therefore, from the nature of the case, in\r\nfavour of dissipation, debauchery, and disorder.\r\n\r\nTo see his work prosper in a soil so unpropitious and amid such hostile\r\ncircumstances might well have quickened the faith of a man much colder\r\nand more sceptical than M. Harmel.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, as I have said, not one workman could be found at Val-des-Bois\r\nwho dared to go to mass. In 1867, at the request of forty of his\r\nworkmen, M. Harmel assisted them in drawing up the statutes and\r\narranging the programme of a Catholic Working-Men's Club. The initiative\r\ncame from them. No pressure of any sort or kind was put upon them to\r\ntake it. It was the free outcome of the influence exerted upon them by\r\nthe example of the Harmel family and by the religious and charitable\r\nwork which the Sisters and the priests had been doing at Val-des-Bois.\r\nWithin a year the club doubled its membership. When the invasion came,\r\nin 1870, it was an established institution.\r\n\r\n'M. Harmel planted his Christians at Val-des-Bois,' said to me one of\r\nthe most interesting men I met at Reims, 'as our vine-growers in\r\nChampagne plant their vines. It is one of the mysteries of our\r\nviticulture that the grapes which yield our most delicate and exquisite\r\nwines of Ay, all sparkle and sunshine, can only be made to yield those\r\nwines when they are planted in our poorest and most chalky soil, and in\r\nregions where the climate is so ungenial that the plants have to be set\r\nas closely as possible together in the ground. We really huddle them\r\ntogether, as we do sheep in the hurdles in winter, to keep one another\r\nwarm. This M. Harmel did with his converts. He taught his workmen to\r\nassociate more closely with one another, he brought their minds and\r\ntheir hearts together, and let them act one upon another. He lived and\r\nmoved and had his own being among them like a father, and in this way\r\ninsensibly they came by degrees to regard each other as members of a\r\nfamily. He has always felt, and his whole life has shown it, that the\r\n\"Declaration of the Rights of Man,\" whatever the motives of its authors\r\nmay have been, put the weak of this world at the mercy of the strong,\r\nand set Capital free to deal with Labour as a mere matter of bargain\r\nand sale. The dominant idea in his mind has always been, as it was in\r\nthe mind of his father before him--the \"good father\" of\r\nVal-des-Bois--not how to get the most work out of his workmen, but how\r\nbest to do his own duty to his workmen, thinking that the best way to\r\nget them, on their part, to do their duty to him. All this, you see, is\r\nquite mediæval and Christian, not in the least modern and scientific!\r\nBut has the modern and scientific way of looking at the relations of\r\ncapital and labour, so far, been what may be called a great success? Do\r\nwe seem to be in the way of organizing a solid modern society on the\r\nprinciples of the \"struggle for life\" and of the \"survival of the\r\nfittest\"? Certainly these principles are a logical outcome of the\r\n\"Declaration of the Rights of Man,\" and of such legislation as that\r\nwhich in 1791 shattered to pieces at a blow the whole ancient and\r\nChristian organization of industry in our unhappy land of France! As\r\ncertainly too, they are admirably fitted to secure either the complete\r\nsubjugation of labour by capital or the relapse of France and of Europe\r\ninto barbarism. Is not universal suffrage a natural and easy weapon of\r\ncapital in any \"struggle for life\" with labour? Is it not clear that, in\r\nlosing the notion of duty to his employer, the workman has necessarily\r\nlost the idea also of duty to his fellow-workmen? \"Every man for\r\nhimself\" is the motto of modern democracy, and do we not see that the\r\nsyndicates of workmen which it was the object of the Radicals to\r\nestablish by their law of March 1884 concerning \"professional\r\nsyndicates,\" in order to facilitate and promote \"strikes,\" are only kept\r\ntogether and made to work by sheer terrorism? What is the sanction of\r\nthe measures ordered by such syndicates excepting the fear in which\r\nevery member goes of his fellow-members? Does not that take us a long\r\nway on towards savage life? Does not that tend directly to build up a\r\nsubterranean machinery of despotism which will be at the service of the\r\nshrewdest head and the longest purse whenever any real and decisive\r\nissue arises between organised capital and organised labour?\r\n\r\n'Look at the part which money played in our first unhappy revolution!\r\n\r\n'It is the most instructive part of that whole sad history, and yet, for\r\na hundred different reasons, it is the part which from the beginning has\r\nbeen most obscured by a miscellaneous conspiracy of silence. Some day\r\nperhaps it will be possible to get a true life written of Le Pelletier\r\nde Saint-Fargeau, the millionaire Mephistopheles of Philippe Égalité.\r\nThe hand that struck him to death in the very centre of the scene of his\r\nlong machinations, there in the Palais Royal, with his vote, dooming the\r\nking to death, still as it were on his lips, did not strike at random.\r\nThere was no such bit of dramatic justice done in those dark days as the\r\nkilling of that man in that place between the giving of that vote and\r\nthe murder of the king that followed it next day!\r\n\r\n'But the story cannot be written yet. They were much more concerned\r\nabout the death of Le Pelletier next day in the Convention, you will see\r\nif you look into the true records of the session, than they were about\r\nthe murder of the king, which was then going on in the Place de la\r\nRévolution. They gave him--why not?--(the most active of them and the\r\ndeepest in the plot were his property, bought and paid for)--they gave\r\nhim a national funeral, and made his heiress--the greatest heiress she\r\nwas in France--the ward of the nation.\r\n\r\n'It was quite another vision he had in his mind for her! I will show you\r\nsome day a curious letter of hers written after she became a duchess,\r\nabout the Empress Joséphine. It is very instructive. She grew up a\r\nlovely, untameable, unmanageable young person, made a love-match, as you\r\nknow, and with whom you know, broke her husband's heart, got a divorce\r\nand married again. To go into all this now would disturb the peace of\r\nfamilies in no way responsible for her career or for the plots and\r\nschemes of her father. It would be like \"flushing\" the ghost of that\r\nmonster Carrier who drowned the poor and the priests at Nantes, only to\r\nplague his descendants. His son was an excellent person who very\r\nproperly changed his name. The most malicious thing I ever knew one\r\nwoman say of another, was said of one of his grand-daughters at a\r\nforeign court by another Frenchwoman, jealous of her social success.\r\n\"She is very charming, no doubt; but look at her mouth, and you will see\r\nshe has carious teeth--_des dents Carrier_!\" But when, if ever, the\r\ntruth about that dark episode of Le Pelletier and his schemes is told,\r\nit will be seen how much more gold and private ambitions had to do with\r\nthe final fatal drift of things after the destiny of France fell into\r\nthe swirl of Paris, than all the howlings and ravings of the\r\nphilosophers and the patriots. What happened in the last century will\r\nhappen again whenever and wherever human society ceases to be held\r\ntogether by the idea of Duty. It is not the discontent of Labour which\r\nmakes me most anxious as to the future. It is the egotism of Capital,\r\neducated and encouraged into egotism by the false doctrines of what is\r\ncalled Liberalism in this country, and provoked into egotism by the\r\nequally egotistic discontent of Labour. What I most value in the work of\r\nM. Harmel is the courage and precision with which he has from the first\r\ninsisted upon the Duty of the employer to the employed. You have seen,\r\nof course, his _Catéchisme du Patron_?'\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Archbishop had given me a copy of this book, which is\r\nreally one of the most remarkable contributions ever made to the\r\npractical study of the relations between Capital and Labour. In it M.\r\nHarmel has condensed, in the catechetical form of questions and answers,\r\nhis lifelong experience in the work of ascertaining and fulfilling all\r\nthe duties incumbent, from the point of view of Christian duty, upon the\r\ncapitalist who employs the labour of his fellow-men in putting his\r\ncapital into use and making it profitable. It would be very interesting\r\nmerely as a theory of the true relations between Labour and Capital. It\r\nis more than interesting as the ripe expression of an experiment\r\nfaithfully and successfully carried out by a man of resolute will and\r\ngreat practical ability for more than a quarter of a century in a field\r\nwhich, when he entered upon it, was certainly one of the most\r\nunpromising in the world.\r\n\r\nThe 'Christian Corporation' was an established institution, as I have\r\nsaid, at Val-des-Bois, in 1870, when the war with Germany broke out. In\r\n1871, after the storm of the invasion had been followed by the horrors\r\nof the Commune of Paris, the principles on which the industrial family\r\nat Val-des-Bois had been organised began to attract attention all over\r\nFrance. A club of Catholic working-men was opened at Paris in 1871, and\r\na movement began in earnest for extending these institutions throughout\r\nFrance. It made rapid progress. In September 1874 a great disaster\r\noccurred at Val-des-Bois. The factory buildings took fire during the\r\nnight of the 12th of that month, and despite the efforts of the whole\r\npopulation they were all in ashes when the morning broke. Before noon of\r\nthe next day M. Harmel announced to his workmen that he had leased, at\r\nno small sacrifice of his immediate pecuniary interests, another factory\r\nat some distance from the Val-des-Bois, called La Neuville, and that the\r\n'Christian Corporation' of Val-des-Bois might at once be transferred\r\nthither, and carried on as before until the reconstruction of its\r\noriginal site. The tidings of this calamity brought substantial succour\r\nfrom Catholic clubs all over France, from Marseilles to Nantes, and from\r\nBordeaux to Lille. More than a hundred clubs were represented in this\r\noutburst of sympathy, and the disaster led, not indirectly, to a formal\r\napproval of the work in a brief issued by His Holiness Pius IX. on\r\nOctober 2, 1874.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 there were more than four hundred clubs in France, with a\r\nmembership of nearly a hundred thousand persons. Concurrently with the\r\ndevelopment of these clubs a movement went on for establishing an\r\norganisation of honorary members, not belonging to the working classes,\r\nwho should co-operate with the clubs in promoting the principles\r\nrepresented by the 'Christian Corporations.' In 1875 a parliamentary\r\ninquiry was made into the condition of Labour in France; and on behalf\r\nof the committee which conducted this inquiry, the deputy, M. Ducarre,\r\nwho drew up the report, declared it to be the opinion of the committee\r\nthat all the syndicating movements of modern times point to the\r\nnecessity of re-establishing the corporate system of labour which was\r\ndestroyed by the First Republic in 1791. The language used in this\r\nReport is worth citing.\r\n\r\n'All the remedies suggested for the existing state of things,' said M.\r\nDucarre, 'may be summed up in this conclusion; there must be an end of\r\nthe isolation of the individual labourer. This must be replaced by the\r\naction of collectivities, associations, or syndicates, whose duty it\r\nshall be to watch over the interests of every calling. In a word we must\r\ngo back to the system of corporations of the trades, _maîtrises_, and\r\n_jurandes_, under which labour was so long carried on in France.' This\r\nReport found no favour in the eyes of the Radicals because it aimed at a\r\ngood understanding and practical co-operation between Labour and\r\nCapital. Nine years afterwards, on March 21, 1884, a law was carried\r\nthrough the French Parliament authorising the establishment of\r\n'professional syndicates.' The object of the Republicans, then as now\r\ncontrolling a majority of the Chamber, in passing this law, was to\r\nstrengthen the trades unions as against the employers of France. The\r\nlaw, it will be observed, was passed at the time when a syndicate of\r\nminers in the North, which had no legal right to exist before the\r\npassage of the law, was actively promoting, under its leader, M. Basly,\r\nthe great strike at Anzin of which I have spoken in a preceding chapter.\r\nBut while the law of March 1884 legalised 'syndicates' of this\r\naggressive, and in the nature of things tyrannical, type, it also\r\nnecessarily legalised precisely such Christian corporations as those\r\ncontemplated in the Report of 1875, and long before organised on the\r\nlines laid down by M. Harmel. A great and visible responsibility was\r\nthus thrown upon the employers of France and upon what are called the\r\nupper classes generally in that country. It was clear that, if they\r\nwould energetically and systematically throw themselves into the work of\r\nbringing about a reconstruction of social order on the principles of\r\nco-operation and sympathy as opposed to the principle of antagonism\r\nbetween Capital and Labour, the law of 1884, intended to widen, might be\r\neffectually used to close the threatening breach between the employers\r\nand the employed. There seems to be little doubt that down to that time\r\nthe promoters of the Christian Corporation movement in France had made\r\ngreater headway with the working classes than with the employers. A\r\nReport presented in 1885 by the general committee of the Catholic clubs\r\nof France to the French bishops states this very plainly. This report\r\nwas signed by the Marquis De La-Tour-du-Pin-Chambly, who from the\r\nbeginning of M. Harmel's experiment at Val-des-Bois had been one of his\r\nmost earnest and active coadjutors, by the Comte de la Bouillerie,\r\nTreasurer of the General Society, by the Comte de Mun, and by the Comte\r\nAlbert de Mun, the moving spirit now of the whole work, who resigned his\r\ncommission in the army to devote himself to it, and who went up from the\r\nMorbihan to Paris as a deputy in 1885, elected by 60,341 votes, to\r\ndemand not only the restoration of the monarchy but a property\r\nrestriction upon the suffrage. In 1889, under the _scrutin\r\nd'arrondissement_ readopted by the terrified Republicans to defeat\r\n'Boulangism,' Count Albert de Mun was re-elected without opposition for\r\nthe 2nd division of Pontivy. In no part of France is the passion of\r\nequality stronger than in the Morbihan; and the contempt of the people\r\nthere for 'universal suffrage' is extremely instructive.\r\n\r\n'Of the Christian Corporations,' says this Report of 1885, 'as of the\r\nworking-men's clubs, it is proper to say that never in any place or at\r\nany time has any obstacle been offered to them by the working classes.\r\nOn the contrary, there is plainly going on among the working classes,\r\nunder the influence of the deplorable crises which affect the industrial\r\nworld, an instinctive and ever-increasing movement towards this\r\nassociation of common and professional interests, the notion of which is\r\nsuggested by the natural sentiment of right and wrong, as well as by\r\nsome confused memory, obscured by revolutionary doctrines, of the\r\ntraditions of Labour in France, which predisposes the working-man to\r\nseek safety in a return to the old system of the Corporations. A\r\nsimilar feeling exists among the employers, who desire, though they too\r\noften despair of seeing, a closer union of interests between themselves\r\nand their working-men. Wherever the movement languishes, one of the\r\nchief causes will be found to be the apathy, the discouragement, and the\r\nfrivolity of the upper classes.'\r\n\r\nIn the case of great factories like that of the Val-des-Bois, the\r\nChristian Corporations naturally are sufficient unto themselves. There\r\nthe employer and the employed between them constitute a small world,\r\nwhich can take care of itself and carry out the numerous subsidiary\r\nfeatures of the system, such as the promotion of domestic economy, the\r\nestablishment of savings-funds, the organisation of festivals and of\r\ncourses of instruction, without relying much, or at all, upon any\r\nco-operation from without. It is in the development of the system for\r\nthe benefit of working-men who are isolated in their work, or employed\r\nin small establishments, that the co-operation of the upper classes is\r\nneeded; and while I incline to think that there is still much ground for\r\nthe strong language on this point employed in the Report of 1885, there\r\nappears to be no doubt that a great improvement has taken place during\r\nthe last three or four years. In 1884 the efforts of the Cardinal\r\nArchbishop of Reims, the Bishop of Angers, and of other energetic\r\nprelates, secured the active participation of the Holy See in the\r\npromotion of this work. In February of that year a pilgrimage to Rome of\r\nmembers of the Catholic Clubs of France was organised. The pilgrims were\r\nreceived in special audience by Leo XIII., and he gave his Papal\r\napprobation and benediction to the work in a very remarkable address\r\nwhich produced a deep and widespread impression throughout Catholic\r\nFrance. Similar pilgrimages were made in 1887 and in 1889.\r\n\r\nOne very important effect of this has been to bring about a better\r\nunderstanding between the parochial clergy of France in general and\r\nthese steadily increasing lay organisations. It is in the nature of\r\nthings that the clergy should be slow in giving their unreserved aid to\r\nany movement, no matter how admirable in itself, which involves a good\r\ndeal of extra-clerical activity in matters religious. This was\r\nillustrated in the attitude of the English Protestant clergy towards\r\nWesley and Whitfield, and there are some curious coincidences--of course\r\nabsolutely undesigned--between some of the methods of the great and\r\npowerful Protestant sect of the Wesleyans and those of M. Harmel's\r\nCatholic Clubs.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist 'class-leader,' for example, reappears in a modified form\r\nin the _zélateurs_ and _zélatrices_ of the Harmel Clubs and\r\nfraternities. These are members, working-men and working-women, who are\r\nwilling to devote themselves to promoting religious sentiments and\r\npractices among their comrades, and who hold regular meetings to\r\nconsider and work out the best and most practical way of doing this.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that in many cases the curés should have looked\r\nwith a little uneasiness upon the development of such a system until it\r\nhad been fully considered and formally approved by the highest authority\r\nin the Church. Of its efficacy from the point of view of M. Harmel there\r\ncan be no doubt.\r\n\r\nSomething not wholly unlike the 'exclusive dealing' which contributes so\r\nmuch to the strength of Methodism in America has also been established\r\nfor the benefit of the members of M. Harmel's Christian Corporation.\r\nThis is 'exclusive dealing 'of an honest and honourable sort, and must\r\nnot be confounded with the rascally 'exclusive dealing' known in Ireland\r\nas 'boycotting.' It combines a system of 'privileged purveyors' with an\r\naccumulative savings fund.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Harmel Brothers, acting for the Corporation, makes contracts\r\nwith tradesmen at Val-des-Bois--grocers, butchers, bakers, and the\r\nlike--by which the tradesmen bind themselves to sell certain wares to\r\nmembers of the Christian Corporations, and to them only, at a fixed\r\ndiscount below the lowest current rate of prices--the wares to be of the\r\nbest quality, under a penalty--and the lowest current rate to be fixed\r\nby an average taken from the current rates as given to Harmel Brothers\r\nby four dealers in such wares in the city of Reims, of whom two are to\r\nbe named by them and two by the 'privileged purveyor.' Each member of\r\nthe Corporation receives certificates, of one franc, ten sous, or ten\r\ncentimes in value, from the office of Harmel Brothers, and these are\r\ntaken by the 'privileged purveyor' in payment at their face value.\r\n\r\nFor him they are each week cashed in money at the office of Harmel\r\nBrothers. If the members prefer to pay the 'privileged purveyor' in\r\ncash, or in orders upon their wages, the sums so paid are inscribed on\r\nthe account of the Corporation. When the weekly or fortnightly accounts\r\nare made up, a certain percentage of the differences between the current\r\nmarket-price of the purchases made and the actual price so paid by the\r\npurchasers goes to what is called the 'Corporation profit,' the residue\r\nof the difference being paid over to the member with his or her wages.\r\nThe 'Corporation profit' is a savings fund. Each member has a book\r\nshowing--with his or her number, and with the full name of the head of\r\nthe family to which he or she may belong--the amount of this fund\r\nstanding each quarter to his or her credit, with interest at 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis can only be drawn out by the member, on leaving the employment of\r\nthe firm, in case of illness or incapacity, or at the age of fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAn actuary's estimate shows that the share of the Corporation profit\r\naccruing to each member in twenty-five years on an annual estimated\r\naverage Corporation profit of 70 francs a member, with five per cent.\r\ninterest, would be 3,300 francs. And this, be it observed, will have\r\ncost the member nothing, being simply a result of the union of employer\r\nand employed in a corporate dealing with the purveyors. In 1879 the\r\nannual budget of a hundred families at Val-des-Bois, earning among them\r\n249,242 francs, showed an actual 'Corporation profit' of 91,319.05\r\nfrancs, which ought to have been much larger had Val-des-Bois then\r\npossessed more than one butcher, baker, grocer, and tailor. These\r\nhundred families comprised 496 members, 279 of them employed in the\r\nfactory and 217 occupied at home.\r\n\r\nDuring the last ten years, and especially since the passage of the law\r\nof March 1884, the scope of these Christian Corporations, not only at\r\nVal-des-Bois and at Reims, but all over France, has been considerably\r\nextended. Many of them have now the character of true guilds, as at\r\nPoitiers, for example, where there is a Corporation of the Builders\r\nunder the invocation of St-Radegonda, another--Our Lady of the\r\nKeys--founded upon a syndicate of clothiers, and a third, of St.-Honoré,\r\nfounded upon a syndicate of provision-dealers. At Lille I found a\r\ntypical Corporation, that of the spinners and weavers, known as the\r\nChristian Corporation of St.-Nicholas. This was founded in May 1885.\r\nThis Corporation admits workmen and workwomen, employees and\r\nmanufacturers, belonging, either by residence or by connexion with the\r\nindustry named, to the commune of Lille or to one of the adjoining\r\ncommunes. It had last year a membership of 887 persons, of whom 26 were\r\nmaster manufacturers and 37 employees, the rest being workmen and\r\nworkwomen. Five large firms were represented in it. The Syndical Council\r\nwas made up of a syndic employer, a syndic employee, and a syndic\r\nworkman from each of these firms, and of a syndic workman, M.\r\nCourtecuisse, representing the members who were employed in other\r\nestablishments. The directing bureau consisted of seven members,\r\nincluding the chaplain. It was presided over by one of the great\r\nmanufacturers of Lille, M. Féron-Vrau, and the two vice-presidents were\r\nM. Edouard Bontry, of the house of Bontry-Droullers, and M. Courtecuisse\r\nalready named.\r\n\r\nThis Corporation, under the law of 1884, can own the buildings necessary\r\nfor its meetings, its libraries, and its lecture-courses; it can\r\nestablish among its members special savings funds, mutual assistance and\r\npension funds; found and conduct offices for information bearing on the\r\nbusiness of its members, and it may be consulted, under Article 6 of the\r\nLaw of 1884, on 'all difficulties and misunderstandings and questions\r\narising out of its specialty.' This provision--specially intended by the\r\nauthors of the law to arm the 'strikers' of France against French\r\nemployers--may thus, it will be seen, be turned quite as effectually to\r\npurposes of concord and harmony as to purposes of discontent and strife.\r\nThe Corporation of St.-Nicholas may receive gifts and legacies in aid of\r\nits Corporation funds and purposes, and generally take an active part,\r\nlike all these Corporations, as was pointed out by Leo XIII. in his\r\n'Encyclical of April 20, 1884,' in protecting, under the 'guidance of\r\nthe Faith, both the interests and the morals of the people.'\r\n\r\nIt already has within its sphere of action a Confraternity of Our Lady\r\nof the Factory, comprising 548 members, a Mutual Aid Society with 218\r\nmembers, an Assistance Fund with 409 members; and a Domestic Economy\r\nFund, the principle of which is that certain dealers make a discount on\r\ntheir wares to members of the Corporation which is certified to by them\r\nin counters of different values. These counters are receivable by the\r\nCorporation in payment of the assessments and subscriptions of the\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe steady development of these institutions during the last four or\r\nfive years has led to the organisation by them of a complete general\r\nsystem of administration, provincial and national. The Corporations are\r\ngrouped not by departments but by provinces.\r\n\r\nProvincial assemblies are held, by which delegates are named to attend\r\nan annual general assembly at Paris. At the general assembly of 1889,\r\nheld on June 24, 350 delegates were present, and the session of the\r\nassembly was opened by the delegation from Dauphiny, the chair being\r\ntaken by one of its members, M. Roche, in virtue, as he explained to the\r\ncrowded audience in the large hall of the Horticultural Society in the\r\nRue de Grenelle, of his descent 'from a representative of the Estates of\r\nDauphiny in 1789.' The work of the assembly was divided between four\r\ncommittees, one on moral and religious interests, one on public\r\ninterests, one on commercial and industrial interests, and one on\r\nagricultural and rural interests.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that the principles of the movement are being\r\nsystematically applied to the whole field of active life in France. The\r\ngeneral maxim of the organisation is the sound, sensible, and military\r\nmaxim, of St.-Vincent de Paul, 'let us keep our rules, and our rules\r\nwill keep us,' and I think there can be no doubt that the French\r\nfreemasons, and the fanatics of unbelief generally who have launched the\r\ngovernment of the Third Republic upon its present course, will find this\r\nnew Christian organisation of Capital and Labour a troublesome factor in\r\nthe political field.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what came in Germany of the _Cultur-Kampf_, and there are\r\ncurious analogies between the work and the spirit of the Catholic Clubs\r\nin France to-day, and the ideas of Monseigneur von Ketteler, which gave\r\nvigour and vitality to the great 'party of the Centre,' in the contest\r\nwith the Chancellor. Where the giant of Berlin had the wisdom to give\r\nway, the pigmies of Paris are likely to persist until they are crushed.\r\nFor they have burned their ships, as the Chancellor never burned his,\r\nand they are dogmatists, while he is a statesman. He sought to control\r\nand use the Catholic Church in Germany. Their object is, as one of the\r\nablest Republicans in France, Jules Simon, long ago told them, to\r\nsupplant a State Church of belief by a State church of unbelief. In\r\nAmerica and in England when men talk of 'religious freedom,' they mean\r\nthe freedom of a man to profess and practise his own religion. What the\r\nThird French Republic means by 'religious freedom' is freedom from\r\nreligion. Their legislation has tended, ever since 1877, not indirectly\r\nnor by implication, but directly and avowedly, to establish in France a\r\nstate of things in which, not Catholics only, but all men who profess\r\nany form of religion, shall be treated as Protestants were in France\r\nafter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, or as Catholics were in\r\nIreland under William III. This is the meaning of M. Gambetta's war-cry\r\n'Clericalism is the enemy.' The phrase was his, but the policy was\r\nannounced by his party long before he invented the phrase in 1877. It\r\nwas distinctly formulated in 1874 by a Republican leader much better\r\nequipped for dealing with such questions than M. Gambetta, who was the\r\nBoanerges not the Paul of the French gospel of unbelief.\r\n\r\nOn September 4, 1874, M. Challemel-Lacour, in a remarkable speech, laid\r\nit down as a fundamental principle of the Republican policy that the\r\nState should so control all the higher branches of education as to\r\nsecure what he called 'the moral unity of France.' It was on this\r\nprinciple that Napoleon in 1808 had re-organised the University of\r\nFrance. M. Challemel-Lacour unhesitatingly called upon the Republicans\r\nto adopt it. If Catholics or Protestants or Israelites were allowed to\r\nfound universities of their own and confer degrees and diplomas, what\r\nwould become of the 'moral unity of France'? The duty of the Republicans\r\nwas to protect and develop this 'moral unity.' So long as one Frenchman\r\ncould be found in France who believed anything not believed by every\r\nother Frenchman, so long this 'moral unity' would be imperfect. The\r\nFrench Liberals of 1830 obviously made a great mistake when they put\r\n'freedom of education' as a right of Frenchmen in the charter. M.\r\nGuizot, the great Protestant Minister of Louis Philippe, obviously made\r\na great mistake when he established the principles of free primary\r\neducation in 1833. The Republicans of 1848 obviously made a great\r\nmistake when they proclaimed 'freedom of education' as a Republican\r\nprinciple. The Jacobins of 1792 were the true 'children of light,' and\r\nthey alone understood how really to achieve the 'moral unity of France,'\r\nM. Challemel-Lacour did not say this in so many words; but he did say in\r\nso many words that he objected to see any bill passed which should\r\nestablish 'freedom of education,' and permit clerical persons to found\r\nuniversities, because, 'instead of establishing the moral unity of\r\nFrance, this newfangled liberty would only aggravate the division of\r\nFrenchmen into two sets of minds moving upon different lines to\r\ndifferent conclusions. The young men educated in these universities,' he\r\nsaid, 'will become zealous apostles of Catholicism. The more ardour they\r\nput into their proselytism the more antagonism they will excite!' At\r\nthis passage in M. Challemel-Lacour's extraordinary speech, according to\r\nthe official report, a member of the Right broke in with the very\r\nnatural exclamation, 'And why not? Is not that liberty? liberty for\r\nall?' To which M. Challemel-Lacour discreetly made no reply, but went on\r\nto say, 'Instead of establishing our moral unity, you will heap up\r\ncombustibles in the country until shocks are produced and perhaps\r\ncataclysms!'\r\n\r\nThis is the doctrine of the worthy Lord Mayor in 'Barnaby Rudge' who\r\nquerulously exclaims to Mr. Harwood when that gentleman came to him\r\nasking for protection against the Gordon rioters, 'What are you a\r\nCatholic for? If you were not a Catholic the rioters would let you\r\nalone. I do believe people turn Catholics a-purpose to vex and worrit\r\nme!' 'Moral unity' would have saved the good Lord Mayor a great deal of\r\ntrouble. 'Moral unity' would have kept things quiet and comfortable\r\nthroughout the Roman Empire under Diocletian, and throughout the Low\r\nCountries under Phillip II. and Alva, and throughout England under Henry\r\nVIII. The Jacobins of 1792 did their best to organise 'moral unity' in\r\nFrance with the help of the guillotine, and of the Committee of Public\r\nSafety and of the hired assassins who butchered prisoners in cold blood.\r\n\r\nHere, at Reims, in September 1792, while Marat 'the Friend of the\r\nPeople' and Danton the 'Minister of Justice' were employing Maillard the\r\n'hero of the Bastile' and his salaried cut-throats to promote public\r\neconomy and private liberty by emptying the prisons of Paris, certain\r\nagents of Marat made a notable effort in behalf of the 'moral unity of\r\nFrance.' To this effort the melodramatic historians of the French\r\nRevolution have done scant justice. Mr. Carlyle, for example, alludes\r\nto it only in a casual half-disdainful way, which would be almost\r\ncomical were the theme less ghastly. 'At Reims,' he observes, 'about\r\neight persons were killed--and two were afterwards hanged for doing it.'\r\nThe contest of this curious passage plainly shows that he imagined these\r\n'eight persons' (more or less) to have been \"killed\" by the people of\r\nReims, roused into a patriotic frenzy by the circular which Marat, Panis\r\nand Sergent sent out to the provinces calling upon all Frenchmen to\r\nimitate the 'people of Paris,' and massacre all the enemies of the\r\nRevolution at home before marching against the foreign invaders. That\r\nthe 'people' of Reims thus aroused should only have killed 'about eight\r\npersons' really seemed to him, one would say, hardly worthy of a truly\r\n'Titanic' and 'transcendental' epoch. There is something essentially\r\nbucolic in the impression which mobs and multitudes always seem to make\r\nupon Mr. Carlyle's imagination. Of what really happened at Reims in\r\nSeptember 1792 he plainly had no accurate notion. He obviously cites\r\nfrom some second-hand contemporary accounts of the transactions there\r\nthis statement, that 'about eight persons were killed,' because, as it\r\nhappens, we have a full precise and official Report of the killing of\r\nall these persons, with their names and details of the massacre, drawn\r\nup on September 8, 1792, by the municipal authorities of Reims and\r\nsigned by all the members of the Council General. Had Mr. Carlyle seen\r\nthis Report, it would have shown him that Marat, Panis and Sergent knew\r\nwhat they were about when they sent out their famous or infamous\r\ncircular, just as Marat and Danton knew what they were about when they\r\norganised the massacres of September in the prisons of Paris. The\r\n'people' of Reims had no more to do with the killing of 'about eight\r\npersons' in the streets and squares of this historic city in September\r\n1792 than the 'people' of Paris had to do with the atrocious butcheries\r\nat the Abbeys and Bicêtre and La Force and the Conciergerie. Mr. Carlyle\r\nought to have learned even from the 'Histoire Parlementaire' of Buchez\r\nand Roux, which he seems to have freely consulted, that 'the days of\r\nSeptember were an administrative business.'\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened at Reims in September 1792 is worth telling. It\r\ndoes not prove, as Mr. Carlyle almost dolefully takes it to prove, that\r\nin the provinces the 'Sansculottes only bellowed and howled but did not\r\nbite.' It does prove that when they bit, they bit to order, and under\r\nimpulses no more 'Titanic' or 'transcendental' than those which in our\r\nown time lead active politicians to invent lies about the character of\r\ntheir opponents, and to manufacture emotional issues on the eve of a\r\nsharp political contest.\r\n\r\nThe subsidised Parisian insurrection of August 10, 1792, prostrated the\r\nmonarchy, but it did not found the Republic. It was the death knell both\r\nof Pétion and of the Girondists, who had been most active in secretly or\r\nopenly promoting it. The Constitution having been torn into shreds,\r\npower became a prize to be fought for by all the demagogues and all the\r\nfactions in Paris. The Legislative Assembly fell into the trough of the\r\nsea. The sections of Paris supported Marat in calmly laying hands on the\r\nprinting-presses and material of the royal printing-office, and\r\nconverting his abominable newspaper into a 'Journal of the Republic.' He\r\nwas voted a special 'tribune of honour' in the hall of the Council. On\r\nAugust 19 he openly called upon the 'people' to 'march in arms to the\r\nprison of the Abbaye, take out the prisoners there, especially the\r\nofficers of the Swiss Guard and their accomplices, and put them to the\r\nsword.' This was an electoral proceeding. The members of the National\r\nConvention were then about to be chosen. Under a law passed by the\r\nexpiring legislature, electors of the members were first to be chosen by\r\nthe voters on August 26, and the electors thus chosen were to meet on\r\nSeptember 2, and choose the members of the Convention. It was in view of\r\nthis second and decisive election day that Marat and Danton settled the\r\ndate at which the great patriotic work of 'emptying the prisons' should\r\nbegin, and it was in view of this day also that the circular already\r\nmentioned of Marat, Panis and Sergent was sent forth to all places at\r\nwhich a lively administration of murder and pillage would be most likely\r\nto conduce to the choice by the electors of deputies agreeable to the\r\nauthors of the circular.\r\n\r\nThe electors for the Department of the Marne chosen on August 26 were to\r\nmeet in Reims on September 2, and choose the Deputies for that\r\ndepartment to sit in the Convention.\r\n\r\nIn Reims Marat had a faithful personal ally in the person of the\r\nProcureur-Syndic, the most important national functionary in the city.\r\nThis man, Couplet, called Beaucourt, was a disreputable and apostate\r\nex-monk who had married an ex-nun. His position, of course, gave him a\r\ngreat influence over the least respectable part of the population, and\r\nwith Marat and Danton at his back in Paris he cared nothing for the\r\nmayor and the municipal authorities. From August 19 to August 31 he kept\r\nissuing incendiary placards and making inflammatory speeches in Reims.\r\nOn August 31 he received an intimation from Paris that a column of\r\nso-called 'Volunteers' was in motion for Reims, and that he must have\r\nthings ready for them. To this end he caused the arrest of the\r\npostmaster, M. Guérin, and of a poor young letter-carrier named Carton,\r\non a charge of sequestrating and burning 'compromising letters' which\r\nought to have been turned over to him and the 'justice of the Republic.'\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the election day there marched into Reims the expected\r\n'Volunteers,' who carried banners proclaiming them to be 'Men of the\r\n10th of August.' Couplet received them and feasted them. They broke up\r\ninto squads and went roaring about Reims denouncing 'the aristocrats'\r\nand demanding 'justice upon all public enemies.' They finally broke open\r\nthe prison, and dragging out the unfortunate postmaster, cut him to\r\npieces in front of the Hôtel de Ville. Some courageous citizens\r\ncontrived to smuggle out of their reach the young letter-carrier, and\r\ntook him for safety into the hall of the Municipal Council.\r\n\r\nThere the murderers followed him, excited by a speech from the\r\nProcureur-Syndic, who knowing that no trial had been had, did not\r\nscruple to say that 'nothing could excuse the unfaithful\r\nletter-carrier.'\r\n\r\nThe town officers tried to get Carton out by a back door, but Marat's\r\nmurderers were too quick for them, and the poor youth was torn to\r\npieces. While this was doing the Procureur-Syndic provided another\r\nvictim. He arrested on some pretext a retired officer of the army, M. de\r\nMontrosier, ex-commandant of Lille, then in the house of his\r\nfather-in-law, M. Andrieux, one of the first magistrates of Reims. M. de\r\nMontrosier being taken to prison, the Maratist mob broke again into the\r\nprison, dragged him out, killed him, and carried his head all over Reims\r\non a pike. Meanwhile a detachment went out to a neighbouring village in\r\nquest of two of the canons of Reims, who had taken refuge there, brought\r\nthem back to the city, and shot them dead in the street. Night now\r\ncoming on, the apostles of the 'moral unity of France,' many of them by\r\nthis time being exceedingly drunk, kindled a huge bonfire in front of\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville, flung into it the mutilated corpses of their\r\nvictims, and towards midnight laying hands upon two priests, MM. Romain\r\nand Alexandre, threw them into the flames! Another band during the\r\nevening broke into the venerable church of St.-Rémi, and tearing down\r\nthe shields and banners which for fourteen centuries had hung above the\r\ntomb of the great Archbishop who made France a Christian kingdom,\r\nbrought these to the bonfire and consumed them.\r\n\r\nDuring this day of horrors, the electors of the department had been in\r\nsession. As the news reached them of what was going on in the streets,\r\none thought came into the minds of all the decent men among them, to get\r\nthrough as fast as possible and quit the city. At the first ballot 442\r\nelectors were present. At the seventh only 203 remained. Of these 135,\r\nbeing the compact 'Republican' minority, gave their votes on that ballot\r\nto Drouet, the postmaster's son of Ste-Ménéhould, Mr. Carlyle's 'bold\r\nold dragoon,' who stopped the carriage of Louis XVI. at Varennes. He was\r\none of the special adherents of Marat, and a most vicious and venal\r\ncreature, as his own memoirs, giving among other matters an account of\r\nhis grotesque attempt to fly down out of his Austrian prison with a pair\r\nof paper wings, abundantly attest. He escaped the guillotine, and\r\nnaturally enough turned up under the empire as an obsequious sub-prefect\r\nat Ste-Ménéhould. The whole of the elections, which in normal\r\ncircumstances would have occupied at least three days, were hurried\r\nthrough before midnight of the first day.\r\n\r\nCouplet, called Beaucourt, was satisfied. But so were not the 'men of\r\nthe 10th of August,' They got their pay of course, but they wanted more\r\nblood. At 9 A.M. the next morning they seized the venerable curé of\r\nSt.-Jean, the Abbé Paquot, and dragged him before Couplet, insisting\r\nthat he should take the constitutional oath. Couplet tried to explain\r\nthat the time for taking it had expired on August 26. But the courageous\r\nAbbé, looking his assassins in the face, said to them: 'I will not take\r\nit, it is against my conscience. If I had two souls I would gladly give\r\none of them for you. I have but one, and it belongs to my God.' He had\r\nhardly uttered the words when he was struck down and cut to pieces.\r\nAlmost at the same moment another priest more than eighty years of age,\r\nthe curate of Rilly, refusing to take the oath, was hanged upon the bar\r\nof a street lantern before the eyes of the Mayor of Reims, who tried in\r\nvain to disperse or control these _sans-culottes_, who, according to Mr.\r\nCarlyle, 'howled and bellowed, but did not bite.'\r\n\r\nBy this time the news came of the surrender of Verdun to the Prussians,\r\nand the tocsin began to sound from the great bells of the cathedral. The\r\ncitizens of Reims suddenly took courage from the sense of the national\r\nperil, not to fall upon and slay helpless and unarmed prisoners, but to\r\nmake head against the murderers and scoundrels who were domineering over\r\ntheir city. The local National Guards began to appear, and were shortly\r\nreinforced by a column of Volunteers from the country armed to meet the\r\ninvaders. The Mayor took command of them and marched to the Hôtel de\r\nVille. There they found that one Chateau, an agent of Couplet, had been\r\nsecretly denounced by his employer as a spy and promptly hanged by the\r\nParisians on the same lantern-bar from which the night before they had\r\nhanged the aged curé of Rilly. His dead body had been flung into the\r\nstill blazing bonfire kept up all night with woodwork from the pillaged\r\nchurches of Reims. The champions of 'moral unity' had also laid hands on\r\nthe wife of this wretched man, and were on the point of throwing her\r\nalive into the flames when the Mayor and the troops appeared. The order\r\nto 'charge bayonets' was given and the whole brood of scoundrels\r\nthereupon broke and fled in all directions.\r\n\r\nAll these details, with others too loathsome to be here reproduced, are,\r\nas I have said, taken from an official _procès verbal_ drawn up at Reims\r\non September 8, 1792, and signed by every member of the Council-General.\r\nThis record was produced when in 1795, after the fall of Robespierre had\r\nopened the way for the great reaction which finally made Napoleon master\r\nof France, the tribunals of the Department of the Marne took steps to\r\nbring to justice such of the assassins of 1792 as they could lay hands\r\nupon. On the 26 Thermidor, An III., two wretches, one a newspaper-vendor\r\nand the other a slopshop-keeper, were condemned to death and executed\r\nfor the murder of the Abbé Paquot and of the curé of Rilly. Two others,\r\na glazier and a shoemaker, were condemned to six years in the\r\nchain-gang.\r\n\r\nThe evidence on which these assassins were convicted in 1795 had then\r\nbeen for two years in the hands of the municipal authorities at Reims.\r\nBut during these two years France had been the football of the employers\r\nand accomplices of these assassins. The municipal authorities had been\r\npowerless to prevent these murders, which were committed in the public\r\nstreets and under the protection of the Procureur-Syndic of the\r\ndepartment, the official representative at Reims of the 'Minister of\r\nJustice,' Danton, at Paris. They were equally powerless to punish them.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of Reims was fortunate to escape denunciation at Paris for\r\nhis attempt to save the lives of some of the victims. That was an\r\noffence against the 'moral unity' which the First Republic tried to\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\nThere was a heroic Mayor in those days at Lille named André. When the\r\nDuke of Saxe-Teschen with his wife, a sister of Marie Antoinette,\r\nappeared before Lille at the head of an Austrian army and demanded the\r\nsurrender of the place, Mayor André, who was a Republican but not of the\r\n'moral unity' type, replied that he had sworn to keep the place, and he\r\nwould keep his oath. With the help of the Ancient Artillery Corporations\r\nof the old Flemish city (Corporations of which the 'Honourable Artillery\r\nCorps' of London and of Boston are offshoots), Mayor André did keep his\r\noath and kept Lille. The Minister Roland, the respectable confederate of\r\nthe virtuous Pétion, sent him promises of help, but no help. Why?\r\nBecause Mayor André had taken the lead in a masculine protest of the\r\nhonest people of Lille against that ruffianly invasion of the Tuileries\r\nby the mob on June 20 which the virtuous Pétion, Mayor of Paris, and his\r\nrespectable confederate Roland had for their own purposes promoted. So\r\nMayor André got words and no troops. But Lille took care of herself;\r\nbore a tremendous bombardment for days without flinching, and finally,\r\nin the early days of October, saw the Saxon Duke and his army march\r\naway, Valmy having opened the eyes of Brunswick to the utter futility\r\nand fanfaronnade of the French emigrant noblesse and princes, who had\r\ndrawn up for him and persuaded him against his own better judgment to\r\nsign the too famous and fatal proclamation with which he heralded the\r\nAustro-Prussian advance into France. Mayor André having thus saved the\r\ngrand North-eastern bulwark of France, his services had to be in some\r\nway recognised. But in what way? Paris voted that Lille had deserved\r\nwell of the nation, which was obvious enough; also that Lille should get\r\na million of francs towards repairing damages, which million of francs,\r\nI am assured, never reached Lille; also that a grand monument should\r\ncommemorate the valour and constancy of Lille. But the grand monument\r\nwas never erected until half a century afterwards, when King Louis\r\nPhilippe took the matter up, and carried it through.\r\n\r\nWith the proclamation of the Republic in September 1792 it ceased to be\r\nmeritorious in Mayors and other municipal personages to protect life and\r\nproperty, repulse foreign invaders and punish domestic criminals.\r\nVarlet, the self-appointed 'Apostle of Liberty,' the man with the\r\ncamp-chair and the red cap, whom Carnot, the grandfather of the present\r\nPresident, actually insisted that the Assembly should welcome to its\r\nfloor, gave the keynote of the new order of things. 'We must draw a\r\nveil,' he exclaimed, 'over the Declaration of the Rights of Man!' And a\r\nveil was indeed drawn over the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Here at\r\nReims, as elsewhere, proscriptions and confiscations were the order of\r\nthe day. The glorious Cathedral of Reims itself, the Westminster and\r\nCanterbury in one of France, was in continual peril. Nothing really\r\nsaved it and the Archi-episcopal palace but the religious and patriotic\r\nreverence of the people of Reims for the memory of Jeanne d Arc. In that\r\nArchi-episcopal palace the peasant girl of Domrémy, the Virgin saviour\r\nof France, had been lodged. In that Cathedral she had stood, her banner\r\nin her hand, and watched the solemn consecration of her mission and her\r\ntriumph. The emissaries of plunder and murder from Paris shrank from\r\ndriving the Rémois to extremities on that issue. But they desecrated the\r\nbuilding and defaced it as much as they dared.\r\n\r\nI am told that Robespierre during his dictatorship interfered to put a\r\nstop to the vandalism of his disciples here, and that we owe to him the\r\npreservation of the magnificent groups which still exist of statues\r\nrepresenting scenes in the life of the Virgin Mary. The groups above the\r\nhead of the Virgin on the double lintel had already been dashed to\r\npieces when he was appealed to. The groups below, still unharmed, afford\r\nunanswerable proof that the sculptors of this part of Europe in the\r\nthirteenth century must have been familiar with the best traditions of\r\ntheir art. If Robespierre preserved these, we may forgive him not only\r\nfor sending his dear Camille Desmoulins and his detested Danton to the\r\nguillotine, but even for replacing the shattered groups of the Nativity,\r\nthe Presentation, and the Death of the Virgin with this inscription of\r\nhis own devising: 'The French people believe in the existence of God and\r\nin the immortality of the soul!' Under the First Consul this inscription\r\ngave place to the Latin dedication now visible.\r\n\r\nPillaging he did not prevent, perhaps could not. One wizened old\r\nreprobate, Ruhl, got himself great Republican _kudos_ by persistently\r\nputting about a legend that he had successfully stolen the sacred\r\nampulla, from which St.-Rémi had anointed Clovis King of France, and had\r\ndashed it to pieces in public. That he did indeed dash in pieces\r\npublicly a flask of glass is, I am assured, indubitable. But not less\r\nindubitable is it that he did not dash in pieces the sacred ampulla.\r\nRuhl was a bit of a scholar, and his legend was obviously suggested to\r\nhim by the traditional story of the Frankish warrior who smashed a\r\nsacred vase at Soissons, and whose own head the stalwart King Clovis\r\nafterwards clove in twain with his battle-axe on the Champ de Mars in\r\nrequital of the deed. Curiously enough, it was written that the head of\r\nRuhl should likewise in the end be smashed, as it was by himself with a\r\npistol at Paris, May 20, 1795, to save it from the guillotine!\r\n\r\nAll the churches of Reims did not escape so well as the Cathedral.\r\nSt.-Nicaise, 'the jewel of Reims' and the masterpiece of a famous\r\narchitect of the thirteenth century, Hues Libergiers, whose name is\r\npreserved in that of one of the chief streets of Reims, was pillaged and\r\nthen pulled down, the materials and the site being sold at a 'mock\r\nauction' to Santerre, the enterprising brewer, who 'pulled the wires' of\r\nall the patriotic emotions of the Faubourg St.-Antoine from the outset\r\nof the Revolution, got himself thereby made a general, and in that\r\ncapacity conducted Louis XVI. to the scaffold, where, as all the world\r\nknows, he ordered the drums to drown the last words of the King. He was\r\nan incorrigible and indefatigable speculator, and while he drove a\r\nroaring trade at Paris in beer, he was always on the look out for\r\ndemolished churches and convents in the provinces. Napoleon took his\r\nmeasure promptly, subsidised and used him to good purpose. Hearing once\r\nthat there was a ferment brewing in St.-Antoine, the Emperor sent an\r\nofficer to Santerre. 'Go and tell that fellow,' he said, 'that if I hear\r\none word from the Faubourg St.-Antoine I will have him instantly shot.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Titanic' and 'transcendental' Faubourg remained as mute as a mouse!\r\n\r\nIn no French city are the memories of the Revolutionary orgie more\r\noffensively out of key with the actual aspect and the great associations\r\nof the place than in Reims. Whatever may have been the ways of the\r\nworking people here forty years ago, I have always been struck by their\r\nquiet and orderly demeanour, as well as by the general air of prosperity\r\nand animation which pervades the city. Its grand Cathedral, the most\r\nconsummate type which exists of the great ogival architecture of the\r\nthirteenth century, stands, the archæologists tell us, on the spot where\r\nthe Romans planted their citadel sixteen centuries ago. Like a citadel,\r\nit dominates the whole city to-day; a fortress no longer, like the Roman\r\ncitadel, of armed force, but of faith, charity, and hope. Seven\r\ncenturies have not shaken the solidity of its massive fabric. They who\r\nbuilt it 'dreamt not of a perishable home.' But only a year ago a\r\nserious dislocation appeared in the framework of the stupendous\r\nrose-window over the grand entrance, and this, with other unsatisfactory\r\nsymptoms observable here and there in the building, lend colour to the\r\ntheory that the great chalk bed upon which the Cathedral stands may have\r\nbeen affected by the percolation of water from some deep trenches which,\r\nit seems, were dug near the northern and southern towers at the entrance\r\nof the Cathedral, during the year 1879, and unfortunately left open\r\nduring the very inclement winter which followed.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather alarming theory, particularly if it be true, as it is\r\nsaid to be, that since 1880 the towers have perceptibly come out of\r\nplumb.\r\n\r\nFortunately the see of Reims is now in the charge of a prelate who fully\r\nappreciates the value to art and to civilisation, as well as to France\r\nand to the Church, of this magnificent edifice. When he came here from\r\nthe bishopric of Tarbes, his first episcopate, in November 1874, one of\r\nthe earliest steps taken by the present Cardinal Langénieux was to get a\r\nfull report on the condition of the Cathedral from M. Millet, the\r\naccomplished successor of M. Viollet-le-Duc in the great work of the\r\nconservation and restoration of the historical monuments of France. M.\r\nMillet, on August 25, 1875, reported that the flying buttresses needed\r\nimmediate attention, and that 'the gables and vaults of the western\r\nfaçade were seriously damaged, so that the rain water was penetrating\r\nthe masonry and threatening the destruction of the numerous statues and\r\nsculptured ornaments of the grand western portal.' This portal, as every\r\ntraveller knows, is simply matchless in the world. The Archhishop\r\nthereupon invited four of his personal friends, all at that time members\r\nof the Ministry--MM. Dufaure, Léon Say, Wallon, and Caillaux--to Reims,\r\nto see for themselves the state of the Cathedral. They came and\r\ninspected the building, and after their return to Paris prepared a bill,\r\nwhich became a law in December 1875, appropriating a sum of 2,033,411\r\nfrancs in ten yearly instalments to the restoration of the Cathedral.\r\nThe work began at once under the direction of M. Millet, who\r\nunfortunately died in 1879.\r\n\r\nIt was prosecuted after his death by another able architect, M. Brugère,\r\nand is now in the hands of M. Darcy, who has shown by his work at Evreux\r\nand St.-Denis that he is no unworthy successor of Viollet-le-Duc. The\r\nappropriation made in 1875 has been expended, but I am glad to find, on\r\nlooking into the Budget for 1890 of the Ministry of Public Worship, that\r\na sum of 301,508 fr. 26 c. is still available for the works at Reims.\r\nThis budget, by the way, is an instructive document. It shows that the\r\nwhole outlay of the State in France upon all objects connected with\r\npublic worship and religion in France and Algiers, excepting the service\r\nof the chaplains in the army and the navy, amounted in 1889 to a little\r\nmore than one franc per head of the population! The whole expense in\r\nconnection with the Catholic Church, the Calvinist and Lutheran\r\nconfessions, the Israelitish religion and the Mussulmans, was no more\r\nthan 45,337,145 francs, a sum less than the amount annually expended by\r\nthe Protestant Episcopal Church of the single State of New York upon\r\nkeeping up its churches, colleges, and clergy! What proportion this sum\r\nbears to the present annual income of the Church property confiscated\r\nunder the first Republic it would be interesting to ascertain. A\r\nProtestant friend of mine in the south of France, who has made some\r\ninvestigations into this subject, tells me that it cannot possibly\r\nrepresent above _ten per cent_. of the present actual product of the\r\nformer property of the Church. Of the whole sum, 228,000 francs were\r\nspent on the civil servants of the ministry. There are seven sub-chiefs\r\nof bureaux in this ministry, all of them now doubtless good atheists,\r\nwho receive salaries of from 3,400 to 5,400 francs a year. The highest\r\nsalary paid to a Protestant pastor even in Paris is 3,000 francs, or\r\n120_l._ a year. The curé of Notre-Dame de Paris receives 2,400 francs,\r\nor less than 100_l._ a year. There are 580 curés of the first class who\r\nreceive from 1,500 to 1,600 francs a year; 275 curés of the second class\r\nreceiving 1,500 francs a year, and 2,527 curés of the third class\r\nreceiving from 1,200 to 1,300 francs a year. The thirty-one clerks in\r\nthe Ministry receive from 1,800 to 4,500 francs a year. The\r\nVicar-General of Paris receives no more than 4,500 francs a year. The\r\nArchbishop of Paris receives, like all the other archbishops, 15,000\r\nfrancs, or 600_l._, a year, which is the salary paid to the Director of\r\nthe Ministry! The Grand Rabbi of the Central Consistory receives 12,000\r\nand the Grand Rabbi of Paris 5,000 francs a year, and the salaries paid\r\nto the Israelitish ministers of religion range from 2,500 down to 600\r\nfrancs, the latter amount being less by 300 francs than the wages of the\r\nservants in the Ministry. The Muftis and Imams in office receive from\r\n300 to 1,200 francs a year. All these salaries, with the outlay on the\r\nconstruction, rent, or maintenance of buildings of all kinds used for\r\nreligious purposes, pensions, and travelling expenses, are comprised in\r\nthe total appropriation of 45,337,145 francs, or a little more than\r\n1,800,000_l._ for the year 1889. During the same year 12,760,745 francs\r\nwere appropriated for the Fine Arts service. I do not say that the sum\r\nthus devoted to the Fine Arts out of the pockets of the taxpayers of\r\nFrance was at all too large. But I do say that it is out of all\r\nproportion large as compared with the sum voted out of the pockets of\r\nthe taxpayers to the maintenance of religious institutions, which an\r\noverwhelming majority of the people of France regard, and rightly\r\nregard, as essential to the stability of law and order. Furthermore,\r\nthis Budget of 1889 shows the spirit in which the fanatics of 'moral\r\nunity' are prosecuting their war against all religions in France. In\r\n1883 the Government's budget amounted to 53,528,206 francs. Here we have\r\na reduction within six years of more than 8,000,000 francs. In 1883 M.\r\nJules Roche, now a deputy for the first district of Chambéry and an ally\r\nof M. Clémenceau, proposed to reduce the Budget of Public Worship to\r\n4,588,800 francs! The Third Republic, it will be seen, is getting on\r\ntowards the proposition of M. Jules Roche--a proposition which clearly\r\ncombines everything that is most open to objection in a legal connection\r\nbetween the State and religion with everything that is most odious and\r\ndangerous in an open war of the State against religion.\r\n\r\nDuring these six years the leaders of this war against religion have\r\nnever dared to draw up a statistical account of the strength of the\r\nvarious religious bodies in France. In 1882 one of their followers, M.\r\nAlfred Talandier, on February 13, rashly proposed that a table should be\r\nofficially prepared of the state of religious opinions in France; but\r\nthe managers of the cause of 'moral unity' were too wily to walk into\r\nthat trap; they quietly stifled the proposition. It really might be a\r\nlittle awkward, even for a Parliamentary oligarchy with a\r\nstrongly-bitted Executive well in hand, to confront, let us say,\r\n37,500,000 of Catholics, Protestants, Israelites, not to mention the\r\nMussulmans in Africa, with a proposition to abolish a Budget of Worship\r\namounting to a little over a franc a head, for the purpose of reducing\r\nFrance to a complete 'moral unity' of absolute unbelief in God and in\r\nthe immortality of the human soul!\r\n\r\nCardinal Langénieux took possession, as I have said, of the\r\nArchi-episcopal See of Reims in November 1874. Seldom has the right man\r\nbeen put into the right place more exactly at the right moment. It was\r\nin September 1874 that M. Challemel-Lacour unfolded the Republican\r\nprogramme of war to the knife against all religion. In September 1874,\r\ntoo, as I have mentioned, the burning of the factory at Val-des-Bois\r\ncalled out a general demonstration of sympathy from the Catholic\r\nworking-men's clubs all over France, which attracted public attention to\r\nthe movement; and in October 1874 Pius IX. issued a brief recognising\r\nits importance and earnestly commending it.\r\n\r\nThe new Archbishop of Reims was exceptionally fitted by his training and\r\nhis experience to promote such a movement.\r\n\r\nHe was a Benedictine of the school of Cluny, bred in the traditions of\r\nthat illustrious Order, to which, without exaggeration, it may be said\r\nthat we owe almost everything that is best worth having in our Western\r\ncivilisation. For upon what does human society rest in the last resort\r\nif not upon the two great pillars of the rule of St. Benedict--Obedience\r\nand Labour? As a priest, the new Archbishop had successively and\r\nsuccessfully administered two of the most important parishes in Paris,\r\none in the workmen's quarter of the Faubourg St.-Antoine, the other in\r\nthe quarter of the noblesse, in the Faubourg St.-Germain.\r\n\r\nAfter a single year passed in the Episcopate at Tarbes, that pleasant\r\ncity on the Adour which all the winds of the Pyrenees have not yet quite\r\ndisinfected of the memory of Barère, he was translated to this great\r\nhistoric see in the prime of his vigour. For fifteen years he has so\r\nruled it that the Christians of Reims and of the Marne now seize with\r\ndelight upon every opportunity of manifesting their incorrigible\r\nindifference to the 'moral unity of France.' You meet workmen in the\r\nstreets going about their work with religious medals openly displayed.\r\nThe churches of Reims are filled with men on great Church festivals.\r\nTaking all the districts of the Marne together, the Revisionists and\r\nMonarchists at the elections of 1889 outnumbered considerably the\r\nGovernment Republicans. These latter polled 35,046 votes in the Marne,\r\nagainst 40,287 polled by the former. The Radicals, who are very strong\r\nin the first district of Reims, polled 11,037 votes there against a\r\nRevisionist vote of 9,230. Do not these figures show, what I believe to\r\nbe the truth, that the 'true Republican' policy of reducing France to\r\n'moral unity' by trampling on the traditions and coercing the\r\nconsciences of the French people is steadily dividing the French people\r\ninto two great camps--the camp of the Social and Radical revolution and\r\nthe camp of the Monarchy? That there was no necessity for this is\r\nillustrated by what I have said as to the relations between the Cardinal\r\nArchbishop of Reims and the Republican Ministers of 1875 who came here\r\non his invitation, and then took steps to secure the preservation and\r\nrestoration of the Cathedral. One of these Republican Ministers, M.\r\nLéon Say, who is largely responsible for clothing the present Government\r\nwith the power which it abuses, has just been signally humiliated by the\r\npresent Government and the dominant majority.\r\n\r\nIn the second district of Bergerac in the Dordogne, the Monarchist\r\ncandidate for the Chamber, M. Thirion Montauban, received 6,708 votes,\r\nagainst 6,439 given to his Republican competitor. I took a special\r\ninterest in this election, because M. Thirion-Montauban is the present\r\nproprietor of the house of Michel de Montaigne, which came into his\r\npossession through his marriage with the daughter of M. Magne, the\r\neminent Finance Minister of Napoleon III. I made a visit there late in\r\nthe summer, and found him busy with his canvass, on lines of respect for\r\npersonal liberty and the right of men to think their own thoughts as to\r\nlife and death, which would have commanded the cordial sympathy of the\r\ngreat Gascon sceptic. The tower, the study, the bedroom of Montaigne are\r\npreserved by him with religious care. The inscriptions on the walls\r\nwhich John Sterling copied so lovingly half a century ago are there\r\nstill, and if indeed there be a life of faith as Tennyson says, 'in\r\nhonest doubt,' the Pyrrhonist seigneur who thought before Pascal that\r\nthe true philosophy was to laugh at philosophy, would not find himself a\r\nstranger in his old haunt to-day because its lower hall has been\r\nconsecrated as a chapel.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of M. Thirion-Montauban behaved throughout the contest\r\nwith extraordinary violence, and on one occasion put him into serious\r\npersonal peril. However, he was elected. When the Chamber met in\r\nNovember his election was contested. M. Léon Say took an active part in\r\nmaintaining the validity of the returns which gave the seat to M.\r\nThirion-Montauban, and the evidence in the case was overwhelmingly in\r\nhis favour. Nevertheless after the Report of the Committee was made, the\r\nmajority of the Chamber coolly invalidated the choice of the electors,\r\nand seated the candidate who had not been elected. It was an open secret\r\nthat this was done quite as much to punish M. Léon Say as to exclude M.\r\nThirion-Montauban.\r\n\r\nIntolerant as the 'true Republicans' are towards their political\r\nopponents, they are still more intolerant towards those 'false\r\nRepublicans' who hesitate at framing the policy of a French Republic in\r\nthe nineteenth century upon the principles which led to the Revocation\r\nof the Edict of Nantes. Were Socrates alive and a Frenchman, he would\r\nstand no chance for a government chair of philosophy in a competition\r\nwith the little atheist Aristodemus, and were David Hume to reappear at\r\nReims, where he got his early schooling, he would certainly find himself\r\ntreated by the authorities as no better than a Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe irreligion of the Third Republic is a dogmatic irreligion. Bayle\r\nwould find no favour in its eyes, because protesting, as he said he did\r\n'from his inmost soul protest, against everything that was ever said or\r\ndone,' he must of course protest against the Nihilism of M. Marcou and\r\nM. Paul Bert.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the 'true Republicans,' it is essential to their\r\nsuccess that with the religious faith they should also abolish the\r\npatriotic traditions of France. M. Jules Simon, a Republican and a\r\nRepublican Minister of Public Instruction, has found himself compelled\r\nto denounce in the clearest and strongest language the deliberate\r\nattempt which these 'true Republicans' are making 'to teach the children\r\nof France that the glory of France began with 1789, and that it was\r\nnever so great as under the Convention.'\r\n\r\nStuff like this is actually taught in the schools into which it is the\r\nobject of the present French Government to drive by statute all the\r\nchildren of the country.\r\n\r\n'These men,' says M. Jules Simon, 'who proscribe the name of Jesus\r\nChrist and forbid it to be mentioned in the schools of France, on the\r\npretext that public education must be neutral in such matters, do not\r\nhesitate to have children compelled to attend schools in which they are\r\ntaught that Louis XIV. was a tyrant without greatness or ability, and\r\nthat Louis XVI. was an enemy of his country justly condemned and\r\nexecuted.'\r\n\r\nOf the great historic France--the France which aided the American\r\ncolonies to establish their independence, after contesting with England\r\nthe dominion of North America and of India for more than a century--the\r\nFrance of Montesquieu and of Rabelais, of Henri IV. and Sully, of\r\nFrançois I. and St.-Louis, of Chivalry and of the Crusades, the coming\r\ngeneration of Frenchmen, if these fanatics can get their way, will know\r\nno more than their Annamite fellow-citizens in Asia. It is not\r\nsurprising that a Government controlled by such men with such objects\r\nshould have amnestied the criminals of the Commune. The _pétroleurs_ who\r\ndestroyed the Tuileries and the Hôtel de Ville were only trying in their\r\npractical way to abolish the history of France before 1789.\r\n\r\nHere at Reims the history of France, I think, will die very hard. No one\r\ncould doubt this who visited the Department of the Marne in the month of\r\nJuly 1887.\r\n\r\nWhen the 'moral unity' men began their sinister work in 1880, the\r\nCardinal Archbishop of Reims was earnestly urging upon the Holy See the\r\nbeatification of the great French pontiff, Urban II., the disciple,\r\nfriend and successor of Hildebrand, and the canonisation of Jeanne\r\nd'Arc, 'that whitest lily in the shield of France, with heart of virgin\r\ngold.'\r\n\r\nOn July 14, 1881, Leo XIII. confirmed the beatification of Urban II. and\r\nfixed of course the date of his death, July 29, as his place in the\r\ncalendar of Church festivals. In July 1882 a solemn Triduum appointed by\r\na Papal Rescript was celebrated with extraordinary pomp in the Cathedral\r\nof Reims.\r\n\r\nTwo Cardinals, one the special Legate of the Pope, more than twenty\r\nbishops, several abbots of the great Benedictine Order of which Urban\r\nII. was a member, and hundreds of the clergy from all parts of France,\r\nwere present. The Cardinal Legate was attended by Monsignor Cataldi, so\r\nlong and so well known to all foreigners in Rome as the master of the\r\nceremonies to the Pope. The Cathedral was crowded. 'What I should like\r\nto know,' said a quiet shrewd master workman who described to me the\r\neffect produced by the scene in the Cathedral, 'what I should like to\r\nknow is why the Catholics of Reims have not the right upon such\r\noccasions to escort the Legate of the Head of the Church from the\r\nrailway station to the Cathedral with a procession and with music and\r\nwith banners? Is that liberty I ask you?'\r\n\r\nThe question seems to me natural enough, particularly as I see that only\r\nthe other day the Freemasons at Grenoble were permitted to force\r\nthemselves, marching in a body with all their regalia and their emblems,\r\ninto the funeral procession of a Prefect who was not a member of their\r\norder at all, and against the protest of the Bishop of Grenoble, who had\r\nbeen asked by the family of the dead man to give him the burial rites of\r\nthe Church. That the Freemasons like other citizens should attend the\r\nfuneral as individuals the Bishop was ready to admit, but he not\r\nunnaturally declined to acquiesce in the deliberate parade on such an\r\noccasion of a body openly and undisguisedly hostile to Christianity in\r\nall its forms.\r\n\r\nWithout a procession, however, the Triduum of the great Pope of the\r\nCrusades was a great success in 1882. It led to the organisation of a\r\nmovement for erecting a magnificent monument to the memory of Urban II.\r\nat his native place. Châtillon-sur-Marne, one of the loveliest little\r\ntowns in the valley of the Marne, situated about twenty miles from\r\nReims. Early in 1887 this monument was completed, and on July 21 in that\r\nyear it was unveiled with a solemn ceremonial in the presence of the\r\nCardinal Archbishop of Reims, of the Papal Nuncio at Paris, and of many\r\nFrench bishops, among them the great orator of the Chamber of Deputies,\r\nMonseigneur Freppel, Bishop of Angers. He delivered a most impressive\r\ndiscourse on the significance of the Crusades, every sentence of which\r\nwas weighted with pregnant allusions to the actual condition of\r\nreligious liberty in France. These allusions were curiously emphasised\r\nby the absence of the Bishop of Orléans, detained at his post in the\r\ncity of 'Jeanne d'Arc' by the sudden 'laicisation' of the schools in his\r\ndiocese!\r\n\r\nThe day was what a perfect day in the summer of Northern France can be.\r\nThe scene might have been planned by a poet or a painter. There are\r\nother Châtillons in France more famous in history, and held in higher\r\nhonour therefore by those useful men the makers of guide-books, than\r\nChâtillon-sur-Marne; and it is in the nature of all castles to stand on\r\npicturesque sites, as of great rivers to flow by large towns. But\r\nneither the Châtillon which saw the birth of the Admiral de Coligny, nor\r\nthe Châtillon which saw Napoleon throw away his sceptre with his\r\nscabbard, stands more beautifully than the quiet little town which\r\nnestles on its green plateau beneath the still majestic ruins of the\r\nchâteau in which the great Pope of the Crusades was born. It overlooks,\r\nin the verdant valley of the Marne, the ancient priory of Binson,\r\nsuperbly renovated now, and restored in great measure through the zeal\r\nand energy of the Benedictine Archbishop of Reims. Around it sweeps a\r\ngreat circle of green and wooded hills, dotted over with fair mansions\r\nand lordly parks. For this province of Champagne is a land of wealth as\r\nwell as of labour.\r\n\r\nFrom a shattered tower of the old feudal fortress floated side by side\r\nthe flags of France and of the Holy See. Beside the ruins rose, sharply\r\ndefined and well detached against the summer sky, the colossal statue of\r\nUrban II. upon its lofty pedestal of granite. About it were arrayed in a\r\npomp of colour and of flowing vestments, the host of ecclesiastics drawn\r\ntogether to do homage and honour in the sight of all men to the\r\nillustrious French pontiff, whom the Church found not unworthy in days\r\nof great stress and sore trial to take up and carry forward the work of\r\nhis friend and teacher and predecessor, Hildebrand. One need not be a\r\nCatholic to recognise the debt of mankind to Gregory VII., of whom,\r\ndying in exile and in seeming defeat at Salerno, Sir James Stephen has\r\ntruly said that he has 'left the impress of his gigantic character upon\r\nall succeeding ages.' One need only be a moderately civilised man of\r\ncommon sense to recognise the debt of mankind to Odo de Châtillon, known\r\nin the pontificate as Urban II. Wherever in the world the evensong of\r\nthe Angelus breathes peace on earth to men of good-will, it speaks of\r\nthe great pontiff and of the Truce of God which he founded, that the\r\nraces of Christian Europe, suspending their internecine strife, might\r\nunite to roll back into Asia once for all the threatening invasion of\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\nBut the thousands upon thousands of people of both sexes and of all\r\nconditions in life who filled the vast plateau of Châtillon on that\r\nsummer day in July 1887, and hailed with tumultuous shouts the monument\r\nof this great Frenchman and great Pope, visibly took a more than\r\nhistoric interest in the occasion. They were moved not only by those\r\n'mystic chords of memory' of which President Lincoln knew the social and\r\npolitical value much better than the French fanatics of 'moral unity,'\r\nbut by a vivid consciousness of the present peril of their country,\r\ntheir homes and their faith. Once more, as in the eleventh century and\r\nin the eighteenth, France needs to-day 'an invincible champion of the\r\nfreedom of the Church, a defender of public peace, a reformer of morals,\r\na scourge of corruption.'\r\n\r\nThis was the true significance of this memorable scene in the Marne. It\r\nwas in the minds of that whole multitude, and it stirred them all with a\r\ncommon impulse when the eloquent Bishop of Angers, after sketching in a\r\nbold and striking outline the career of Urban II., thus drove its lesson\r\nhome:--'Urban II. and the Popes of the Middle Ages have made for\r\nevermore impossible any return to the pagan theory of the omnipotence of\r\nthe State. Ah, no doubt, despite that signal defeat, despotism will\r\nreturn to the charge. More than once in the course of the ages we shall\r\nsee fresh appeals to violence against a power which can defend itself\r\nonly by appealing to moral authority. We shall see, as we saw under\r\nHenry of Germany, emperors, kings, and republics strive to forge chains\r\nfor the Church by their laws and their decrees. But the memory of the\r\nheroic struggles of the eleventh century will not pass out of the minds\r\nof the people. Canossa will remain for ever an inevitable stage in the\r\nprogress of every power which undertakes to suppress religion and the\r\nChurch.'\r\n\r\nThis festival of Urban II. fell in the week which includes the\r\nanniversary of the coronation of Charles VII. at Reims in the presence\r\nof Jeanne d'Arc, and the Cardinal Archbishop availed himself in July\r\n1887 of this circumstance to crown the manifestation at Châtillon by a\r\nsolemn commemoration in the Cathedral at Reims of the triumph of the\r\npeasant-girl of Domrémy. He was a schoolfellow at St.-Sulpice and has\r\nbeen a lifelong friend of Gounod, and upon his suggestion the great\r\nFrench composer produced for the commemoration his Mass of Jeanne d'Arc.\r\nHe came from Paris himself to superintend the execution of the music.\r\nSimple, grand, choral, in the manner of Palestrina, music of the\r\ncathedral, not of the concert, I must leave my readers to imagine what\r\nits effect was beneath those vast and magnificent arches which had\r\nlooked down four centuries ago upon the Maid of Orléans kneeling with\r\nher banner in her hand before the newly-anointed King who owed his crown\r\nto Heaven and to her, and praying that, now her mission was fulfilled,\r\n'the gentle prince would let her go back to her own people and to tend\r\nher sheep.'\r\n\r\nI do not think it would be easy to convince anyone who that day\r\nwitnessed the profound and silent emotion of those assembled thousands\r\nin the Cathedral of Reims that the religious sentiment is either dead or\r\ndying in France! In the evening of the same day the Cathedral was\r\nthronged again, and thousands of men stood there for an hour, as I saw\r\nmen stand in Rome last year under the preaching of Padre Agostino, to\r\nlisten to a very remarkable sermon from one of the most eloquent\r\npreachers in France, Canon Lemann of Lyons. In the course of this sermon\r\nthe preacher incidentally, but with an obvious and courageous purpose,\r\ndwelt at some length upon the energy with which Urban II. had denounced\r\nand repressed the 'false Crusaders' who, under cover of the uprising of\r\nChristendom against the infidel, fell upon, persecuted, and massacred\r\nthe Jews in Europe. This quiet and earnest protest against the\r\n'Jew-baiting' tendency which is showing itself in France, as well as in\r\nGermany, was plainly understood, and as plainly commanded the sympathy\r\nof his hearers. This was the case also with his admirable treatment of\r\nthe international aspects of the story of the Maid of Orléans. There was\r\nnot a trace of Chauvinism in his citation of the simple and downright\r\nmessage sent by the Pucelle to the English before Orléans. 'I have been\r\nsent by God to throw you out of France.' Out of France she did throw\r\nthem. 'In this,' said the preacher, 'Jeanne d'Arc did a great service to\r\nEngland as well as to France. The fair-haired nation of the North had\r\nfought side by side with France, Coeur de Lion with Philip Augustus,\r\nin the Crusades. When, therefore, the destined queen of the seas sought\r\nto establish herself as a Continental power in the heart of Europe, the\r\nLord put in her way that grain of star-dust from Domrémy, forced her\r\nback to her vocation, and bade her content herself with being sovereign\r\non the ocean.'\r\n\r\nI spoke of this allusion to the Jews with a most accomplished\r\necclesiastic who dined at the Archi-episcopal palace. He was very much\r\npleased with it. 'One of the most mischievous things done,' he said, 'by\r\nthe present Government is that it is certainly fomenting--I cannot say\r\nwhether ignorantly or wilfully--a great deal of popular hostility to the\r\nJews by giving important official positions to men who, though\r\nIsraelites by blood, are in most cases no better Israelites than they\r\nare Christians. Very nearly half the préfectures in France are filled by\r\nsuch persons. When, as is too often the case, they carry out offensive\r\nand tyrannical measures against the Catholic schools and congregations\r\nin an unnecessarily offensive and tyrannical manner, it is very easy, as\r\nyou must see, for hasty or malevolent persons to persuade the people\r\nthat they do this because they are Jews, and as Jews hate the\r\nChristians. I know that the best Israelites in France regret this as\r\nmuch as I do. The policy of this Government is aimed as clearly at the\r\nextinction of the Jewish as of the Christian faith; at the Grand Rabbis\r\nas mercilessly as at the Archbishops of France.'\r\n\r\nThis same ecclesiastic gave me some particulars of the virulence with\r\nwhich the anti-religious war is waged. He told me of one case of recent\r\ndate in Paris in which the authorities of a hospital neglected for two\r\ndays to pay any heed to the entreaties of a poor patient that they would\r\nsend for a priest to attend him, the doctors having given him to\r\nunderstand that for him the end was near. The chaplains, it will be\r\nremembered, have been expelled from all the public hospitals. Finally\r\nsome person in charge of the place, more humane than his fellows, sent\r\nout to a Lazarist house in the neighbourhood and asked the Lazarists to\r\nsend a priest. The priest came. He was received very rudely, kept\r\nwaiting a long time in an ante-room, and when he was finally conducted\r\nthrough the wards to the dying man, all sorts of vulgar and foolish\r\njeers were uttered about his mission as he passed along; and it was with\r\nthe greatest trouble that he finally succeeded in imposing some sort of\r\ndecent respect for the death-bed of this poor sufferer upon the hospital\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\n'This is the spirit,' said the priest who told me the tale, 'of the\r\nCommune, or rather of those Communards who murdered the hostages. These\r\nmurderers simply put this spirit into deeds instead of words. They made\r\nthe name of the Commune so odious that when Victor Hugo in 1876 proposed\r\na general amnesty of the condemned Communards, the Chamber rejected it\r\nwithout taking a vote.\r\n\r\n'In 1880 the same general amnesty was proposed, and the Chamber adopted\r\nit by a very large majority. Do you wonder that thoughtful men look with\r\nhorror on the current which is carrying us in such a direction as that?\r\nAt this moment two men of high personal character, Admiral Krantz and M.\r\nCasimir Périer, are lending their support to a Government which\r\nrepresents this current, and yet Admiral Krantz and M. Casimir Périer\r\nhave recorded their deliberate conviction that the men who clamoured for\r\nan unconditional, indiscriminate amnesty for the Communards were simply\r\nabusing the name of clemency for the rehabilitation of crime.\r\n\r\n'Look again,' he said, 'at the spirit in which the laicization of the\r\nschools is conducted. There are a hundred families we will say in a\r\nvillage. Ninety-nine of these families are Christian families, not\r\nfamilies of saints--I wish I knew such a village as that!--but Christian\r\nfamilies. Go into their homes, and you will see the crucifix hanging in\r\nthe chambers, religious prints upon the walls. One family is a family of\r\natheists. I suppose the case, for as a matter of fact I know no such\r\nfamily. But I will suppose it. There is a school in the village, and in\r\nthat school there hangs a crucifix, the gift of some pious resident.\r\nNinety-nine fathers and mothers of the village desire that crucifix to\r\nbe respected. One father and one mother (a bold supposition this!)\r\ndesire it to be removed. The authorities send in a man who plucks it\r\ndown, before the children, and throws it out of the door. I simply state\r\nwhat has happened over and over again! Is there any respect for equal\r\nrights--for the rule of the majority, for freedom of conscience in such\r\nproceedings? Take the case of the Virgin of Béziers. In that ancient\r\ncity stood two statues of the Virgin, one in bronze and one in marble.\r\nThe civil authorities called upon the Church to suppress them. The\r\nChurch authorities of course declined to do this. Thereupon the civil\r\nauthorities take the money of the taxpayers and expend it in depriving\r\nthe city of these two monuments. Suppose the Turkish authorities were to\r\ndo a thing like this in a town full of Christians under their dominion,\r\nwhat would all the civilised world say about the Turks?\r\n\r\n'And it is done in a French city by Frenchmen either to carry out their\r\nown self-will or to exasperate and insult their fellow-citizens, or for\r\nboth reasons at once!\r\n\r\n'Still another case you can see for yourself at Domrémy. There under a\r\npious and patriotic foundation to which Louis XVIII largely contributed\r\nthe home of Jeanne d'Arc, religiously preserved in its original state,\r\nwas confided to the keeping of some Sisters. They dwelt in a neat\r\nedifice constructed on the grounds purchased to secure the house of the\r\nPucelle, and there the children of Domrémy and the neighbouring communes\r\ncame to school and were gratuitously taught. Only the other day the\r\nlocal authorities were instigated, I know not by whom--perhaps by the\r\nfriends of M. Ferry at St.-Dié, which is not very far off--to \"laicize\"\r\ninstruction in Domrémy. To this end they turn the Sisters out, put the\r\nhome of Jeanne d'Arc under the charge of a lay guardian, who has to be\r\npaid by the State, of course, tax the commune to pay a lay teacher, and\r\nmake the school a lay school at the very door of the home of the\r\nvillage maiden to whose religious faith France owes her freedom and her\r\nnational existence!'\r\n\r\nI made a visit to Nancy and the Department of the Meurthe et Moselle not\r\nlong after I had this conversation in Reims. The Mother Superior of the\r\ngreat Sisterhood of Christian Doctrine at Nancy confirmed this amazing\r\nstory of the performances at Domrémy, and gave me many particulars of\r\nthe petty persecutions to which the Sisters who conduct schools all over\r\nFrance are subjected. The schools are open at all hours to the invasion\r\nof Inspectors, who magnify their office too often in the eyes of the\r\nchildren by treating the teachers (lay as well as religious) with the\r\nsort of amiable condescension which marks the demeanour of an agent of\r\nthe octroi overhauling the basket of a peasant-woman at a barrier. If a\r\nSister has a religious book, her own property, lying on her desk, it is\r\nviolently snatched up, and the children are invited to say whether it\r\nhas been used to poison their young minds with religious ideas. 'In\r\nshort,' said the Mother Superior very quietly, 'our Sisters are really\r\nmuch better treated in Protestant countries than in Catholic France.'\r\n\r\nDomrémy-la-Pucelle is a typical agricultural village of Eastern France.\r\nIt is in the Department of the Vosges and in the verdant valley of the\r\nMeuse. I drove to it on a lovely summer's morning after visiting\r\nVaucouleurs, where the Pucelle came before the stout Captain Robert de\r\nBeaudricourt and said to him, 'You must take me to the King. I must see\r\nhim before Mid Lent, and I will see him if I walk my legs off to the\r\nknees!' This interview began her marvellous career.\r\n\r\nFrom certain articles in newspapers about a drama of _Jeanne d'Arc_, now\r\nperforming at Paris, I gather that Jeanne's moral conquest of France\r\nwhich preceded and led to her material victory over the English\r\ninvaders, has at last been satisfactorily explained by the scientific\r\nbelievers in hypnotism! Of this I can only say, with President Lincoln\r\non a memorable occasion, 'for those who like this kind of explanation of\r\nhistorical phenomena, I should suppose it would be just the kind of\r\nexplanation they would like.'\r\n\r\nThe country between Vaucouleurs and Domrémy is agreeably diversified,\r\nwell wooded in parts, and rich in fair meadow-lands. At Montbras a\r\nlittle old lady dwells and looks after her affairs in one of the most\r\npicturesque château of the sixteenth century to be seen in this part of\r\nFrance, machicolated, crenellated, and dominated by lofty towers. We\r\npassed, too, through Greux, a small village on the Meuse, the dwellers\r\nin which were astute enough to get themselves exempted by Charles VII\r\nfrom all talliages and subsidies 'by fabricating documents' to prove\r\nthat Jeanne d'Arc was born there. The incident is curious as going to\r\nshow that the 'downtrodden serfs' and 'manacled villeins' of the middle\r\nages had their wits about them, and could take care of themselves when\r\nan opportunity offered, as well as the 'oppressed tenantry' of modern\r\nIreland. Domrémy, which is no bigger than Greux, neither of them having\r\nthree hundred inhabitants, straggles along the highway. The houses are\r\nwell built--the church is a handsome, ogival building of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, restored in our day, but quite in keeping with the place and\r\nits associations. Within it, under a tomb built into the wall, lie the\r\ntwo brothers Tiercelin, sons of the godmother of Jeanne, who bore their\r\ntestimony manfully to the character of the deliverer of France, when the\r\nChurch was at last compelled to intervene in the interest of truth and\r\njustice between the French Catholics who had worshipped her as a\r\n'creature of God,' and the English Catholics who had burned her as an\r\nemissary of the Evil One.\r\n\r\nAlmost under the shadow of the church tower stands the house in which\r\nJeanne was born and bred. A charming, old-fashioned garden, very well\r\nkept, surrounds it. If when you leave the church you pass around by the\r\nmain street of the village, you soon find yourself in front of a neat\r\niron railing which connects two modern buildings of no great size, but\r\nneat and unpretending. Entering the gateway of this railing you see\r\nbefore you, shaded by well-grown trees, one or two of which may possibly\r\nbe of the date of the house, the quaint fifteenth-century façade of the\r\nhouse of Jacques d'Arc, and his wife Isabelle Vouthon, called Romée\r\nbecause she had made a pilgrimage to the Eternal City. A curious\r\ndemi-gable gives the house the appearance of having been cut in two. But\r\nthere is no reason to suppose it was ever any larger than it is now.\r\nProbably, indeed, this façade was erected long after the martyrdom of\r\nJeanne. Over the ogival doorway is an escutcheon showing three shields,\r\nand the date, 1480, with an inscription, '_Vive Labeur, Vive le Roy\r\nLouys!_' This goes to confirm a local tradition that the façade was\r\nbuilt at the cost of Louis XI., who understood much better than his\r\nfather the political value to the crown and to the country of France of\r\nthe marvellous career of the peasant girl of Domrémy. The date of this\r\ninscription is particularly significant. In 1479 was fought the battle\r\nof Guinegate, which was lost to France by the headlong flight of the\r\nFrench chivalry from the field. Louis XI. turned this disaster to good\r\naccount. He made it the excuse for founding, in 1480, his regular army\r\nof mercenaries, liberating the peasants from the burden of personal\r\nmilitary service to the lords, and drawing to himself the power of the\r\nState through taxation. '_Vive Labeur, Vive le Roy Louys!_' was a\r\npopular cry throughout France in 1480; for Labeur in those days meant\r\nwhat it means now in the _Terra di Lavoro_--the tilling of the fields.\r\nOne of the three shields above this doorway has a similar significance.\r\nIt is a bearing of three ploughshares. With it are emblazoned on the\r\nhouse of the Pucelle two other shields, one bearing the three royal\r\nfleurs-de-lys of France, and the other the arms granted to the family of\r\nthe heroine--_azure_, a sword _argent_ pommelled and hilted _or_, and\r\nabove a crown supported by two fleurs-de-lys. With these arms, as\r\nwe know, the family took the name of De Lys. The name, the arms, and the\r\ninscription over the doorway were a perpetual witness to the peasants of\r\nChampagne and Lorraine of the unity of interests established by King\r\nLouis between the spade and the sceptre. With the help of an inspired\r\ndaughter of the people, King Charles had driven the English into the\r\nsea, and delivered the land. With the help of the people, King Louis had\r\nbroken the power of Burgundy, and put the barons under his foot. '_Vive\r\nLabeur, Vive le Roy Louys!_' I do not wonder this skilful craftsman 'of\r\nthe empire and the rule' lamented on his death-bed in 1483, at\r\nPlessis-les-Tours, that he could not live to crown the edifice he had so\r\nwell begun. We in England and America know him only in the magic mirror\r\nof the Wizard of the North. But France owes him a great debt. He was\r\ncruel, but in comparison with the cruelty of Lebon, of Barère, of\r\nBillaud-Varennes, his cruelty was tender mercy, He was a hypocrite, but\r\nhis hypocrisy shows like candour beside the perfidy and the cant of\r\nPétion and of Robespierre, while in the great 'art and mystery' of\r\ngovernment he was a master where these modern apes of despotism were\r\nclumsy apprentices.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the house of Jeanne is probably in the main what it was\r\nwhen Jeanne dwelt here with her parents, her sister and her brothers.\r\nThe ground floor contains a general living-room, the large chimney-place\r\nof which may perhaps be of the time of Jeanne, and three bedrooms, one\r\nof which, a chamber measuring three mètres by four, and lighted only by\r\na small dormer window looking out upon the garden, tradition assigns to\r\nJeanne and to her sister. Here, the people of Domrémy believe, the\r\nmaiden sate almost within the shadow of the old church-tower, and heard\r\nthe voices of St. Catherine and St. Margaret, and Michael the Archangel,\r\npatron and defender of France, mingling with the sound of the church\r\nbells, and calling upon her to arise, and leave her village home and the\r\nstill forests of Domrémy and her silly sheep, and go out into a world of\r\nwar and confusion and violence, and rally the broken armies of her\r\npeople, and lead them, like another Deborah or Judith, to victory.\r\n\r\nThat Jeanne heard these voices or believed she heard them, the\r\ndocumentary evidence unearthed by Quicherat abundantly proves. It\r\nproves, too, that she was cool, clear-headed, self-possessed, thoroughly\r\nhonest, and absolutely trustworthy in every relation of life. This being\r\nher character, what did she do? She made her way from her solitude in\r\nLorraine to the court of the King at Chinon, with nothing but her faith\r\nin her voices and her mission to sustain her; put herself into the\r\nforefront of the battle of France, threw the English back into England,\r\nand saw the successor of St.-Rémi put the crown of Clovis upon the head\r\nof a prince whom nobody but herself could have led or driven to Reims.\r\n\r\nIf anybody in Paris or elsewhere knowing all this feels quite sure that\r\nJeanne did not hear the voices which she believed herself to have\r\nheard, he certainly is to be pitied. It may do him good to consider in\r\nhis closet what Lord Macaulay has said in a certain celebrated essay\r\nconcerning Sir Thomas More and the doctrine of Transubstantiation.\r\n\r\nA man may intelligently believe or disbelieve in the reality of the\r\nvoices heard by Jeanne, but no man who intelligently disbelieves in them\r\ncan need to be told that his disbelief rests upon no better scientific\r\nground than the belief of the man who believes in them.\r\n\r\nTo take the home of Jeanne d'Arc out of the keeping of devout women who\r\nshare the faith of Jeanne, that faith which, well or ill founded,\r\nunquestionably saved France, was simply a stupid indecency. In the\r\nkeeping of the Sisters the home of Jeanne was a shrine. In any other\r\nkeeping it becomes a show.\r\n\r\nThe essential vulgarity of the performance is bad enough. But a\r\nsharp-witted Domrémy man who took me on to Bourlémont in his 'trap'\r\nassured me, in a matter-of-fact way, that in the village the chief mover\r\nin the affair was commonly believed to have got a good _pot-de-vin_ for\r\nsecuring the position of keeper of the house for a person of his\r\nacquaintance. This may have been a bit of village scandal, but such\r\nperformances naturally breed village scandals. Whether it was or was not\r\na 'job' in this sense, it certainly marks as low a level of taste and\r\neducation as the pillage by Barère and his copper 'Syndicate' of the\r\nhistoric tombs of France at St.-Denis in 1793.\r\n\r\nSome years ago all France was incensed by a nocturnal desecration of the\r\nstatue of Duguesclin which stands at Dinan in the very lists in which\r\nfive hundred years ago the Breton hero met and vanquished 'Sir Thomas of\r\nCanterbury.' The indignation of France was righteous, and if there was\r\nany foundation for the popular impression that the outrage was\r\nperpetrated by some English lads on a vacation tour, no language could\r\nwell be too strong to apply to it. But I did not observe that any\r\nParisian journalist alluded at that time to the way in which the ashes\r\nof Duguesclin himself were treated in 1795 at St.-Denis, by Frenchmen\r\ndecked in tri-coloured scarves! It did not even occur to them to\r\nremember how long ago and by what hands the column of the Grand Army was\r\npulled down in the very heart of Paris!\r\n\r\nWhile the force of Philistine fatuity can no further go than it has gone\r\nin the 'laicization' of the home of Jeanne d'Arc, I ought to say that\r\nthe actual keeper of the place seemed to me to be a decent sort of\r\nfellow, not wholly destitute of respect for its traditions and its\r\nsignificance. The house and the garden are neatly kept. In the centre of\r\nthe main room stands a fine model in bronze of the well-known statue of\r\nJeanne d'Arc, by the Princess Mary of Orléans, with an inscription\r\nstating that it was given by the King, her father, to the Department of\r\nthe Vosges, to be placed in the house where Jeanne was born.\r\nCommemorative tablets are set here and there in the walls; and in one of\r\nthe modern buildings in front of the house a collection is kept of\r\nobjects illustrating the life of the Pucelle.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of these is a banner given by General de Charette,\r\nto the valour of whose Zouaves the French are indebted for one of the\r\nfew gleams of victory which brighten up the dark record of 1870 It was\r\nat Patay that in June 1429 the English, under Sir John Fastolf, for the\r\nfirst time broke in a stricken field and fled under the onset of the\r\nFrench, led by the Maid of Orléans, leaving the great Talbot to fall a\r\nprisoner into the hands of his enemies. And at Patay, again in December\r\n1870, the German advance was met and repulsed by the 'Volunteers of the\r\nWest,' that being the name under which the silly and intolerant\r\n'Government of the National Defence' actually compelled the Catholic\r\nZouaves to fight for their country, just as they forced the Duc de\r\nChartres to draw his sword and risk his life for France as 'Robert\r\nLefort.' These puerilities really almost disarm contempt into\r\ncompassion. At Patay in 1870 the Zouaves saw three of their officers,\r\nall of one family, struck down in succession, two of them to death, as\r\nthey advanced on the lines of the enemy, bearing a banner of the\r\nSacré-Coeur, which had been presented to General de Charette by some\r\nnuns of Brittany only a few days before the battle. The banner, now at\r\nDomrémy, is a votive offering of General de Charette and his Zouaves in\r\ncommemoration of the field on which they were permitted thus, after four\r\ncenturies, to link the piety and the patriotic valour of modern France\r\nwith the deathless traditions of Domrémy, of Orléans, and of Reims.\r\n\r\nThis little museum contains, too, a picture given by an Englishman, of\r\nJeanne binding up the wounds of an English soldier after the repulse of\r\none of the English attacks. The soil has risen about the house of\r\nJeanne, and this may have made the interior seem more gloomy than it\r\nonce was. But the house is well and solidly built, and if it may be\r\nthought a fair specimen of the abodes of the well-to-do peasantry of\r\nLorraine in the fifteenth century, they were as well lodged relatively\r\nto the general average of people at that time as those of the same class\r\nin Eastern France now on the average appear to be. Charles de Lys in the\r\nearly seventeenth century seems to have been a man of note and\r\nsubstance. But the parents of Jeanne were simply peasant proprietors. At\r\nthe entrance of the village church there is a statue of Jeanne, the work\r\nof a native artist, in which she appears kneeling in her peasant's\r\ndress, one hand pressed upon her heart and the other lifted towards\r\nHeaven. And in a little clump of fir-trees near her house stands a sort\r\nof monumental fountain, surmounted by a bust of the Pucelle. The house\r\nitself remained in the possession of the last descendant of the family,\r\na soldier of the Empire named Gérardin, down to the time of the\r\nRestoration. Some Englishman, it is said, then offered him a handsome\r\nprice for the cottage, with the object of moving it across the Channel,\r\nas an enterprising countryman of mine once proposed to carry off the\r\nhouse of Shakespeare to America. Gérardin, though a poor man, or perhaps\r\nbecause he was a poor man, refused. The department thereupon bought the\r\nhouse, the King gave Gérardin the cross of the Legion, and he was made a\r\n_garde forestier_.\r\n\r\nUpon the expulsion of the Sisters from the home of La Pucelle, some of\r\nthe most respectable people in the department at once organized a fund,\r\nand built for them a very neat edifice in the village in which they are\r\nnow installed. Fully four-fifths of the children of the country round\r\nabout, I was told, still attend their free school. 'Ah! Sir,' said a\r\ncheery solid farmer of Domrémy to me, while I stood waiting for my\r\n'trap,' to continue my journey, 'it does not amuse us at all to pay for\r\nthe braying of all these donkeys! Do you know, it costs Domrémy, such as\r\nyou see it, twelve hundred francs a year, this nonsense about the\r\nSisters and the house of La Pucelle! And to what use? What harm did the\r\nSisters do there? It is not the Pucelle who would have put them out, do\r\nyou think? In the old time Domrémy paid no taxes because of the Pucelle.\r\nNow because of the Pucelle we must pay twelve hundred francs a year for\r\nwhat we don't want!'\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may thank me--as the guide-book gives no very\r\naccurate information on the subject--for telling them that\r\nDomrémy-la-Pucelle may be very easily, and in fine weather very\r\npleasantly, visited from Neufchâteau on the railway line between Paris\r\nand Mirécourt. Neufchâteau itself is an interesting and picturesque\r\ntown. It suffered severely from the religious wars, but two of its\r\nchurches, St. Christopher and St. Nicholas, are worth seeing. There are\r\ntwo very good statues of Jeanne d'Arc, and the Hôtel de la Providence,\r\nkept by a most attentive dame, is a very good specimen of a small French\r\nprovincial inn. There a carriage can be had for Domrémy, and with a\r\nluncheon-basket a summer's day may be most agreeably spent between\r\nNeufchâteau and the little station of Domrémy-Maxey-sur-Meuse, at which\r\npoint, about three miles beyond Domrémy-la-Pucelle, you may strike the\r\nrailway which leads to Nancy. The old capital of Lorraine, though not\r\nnearly so trim and well kept as it used to be, is still one of the most\r\ncharacteristic and interesting cities in France.\r\n\r\nVery near Domrémy-la-Pucelle, a resident of the country, M. Sédille, has\r\nbuilt, on a fine hill overlooking the valley of the Meuse, a small\r\nchapel adorned with a group representing the Maiden kneeling before her\r\nSaints and the Archangel. This chapel stands on the place where, as\r\ntradition tells us, Jeanne first heard the heavenly 'voices.' It was\r\nthen in the heart of a great forest, long since thinned away. It now\r\ncommands a wide and beautiful view of a finely varied country. There,\r\ndriving from Bourlémont on a lovely summer afternoon, I found a young\r\npilgrim from the Far West of the United States doing homage to the\r\nmemory of the Maid of Orléans. He had made his way here from Paris and\r\nthe Exposition. 'I got enough of that,' he said, 'in about three days,\r\nwith the help of a French conversation book.' His method was to look up\r\na phrase as nearly as possible expressing what he wanted to say, and\r\nthen to submit this phrase in the book to his interlocutor. 'How do you\r\nfind the plan work?' I asked him. 'Oh, very well,' he replied; 'the\r\nFrench are so very obliging. I'm afraid it wouldn't work as well the\r\nother way, on our side of the pond.' His worship, not of heroes, but of\r\nheroines, was most simple and downright. 'I consider Joan of Arc,' he\r\nsaid, 'the greatest woman that ever walked the earth, and next to her\r\nCharlotte Corday. And these miserable Englishmen burnt one,' he added\r\nscornfully, 'and these miserable Frenchmen guillotined the other. I\r\ndon't wonder this Old World is played out if they can't treat such women\r\nbetter than that!'\r\n\r\nHe was charmed with the story of Adam Lux (caricatured by Mr. Carlyle),\r\nwho (like André Chénier) invited death by his defiant homage to\r\nCharlotte Corday. 'Well now, I suppose,' he said, 'that if there had\r\nbeen fifty more men in Paris then as brave as that Adam Lux, they could\r\nhave taken all those cowards and murderers and chucked them into the\r\nSeine!' He rejoiced over the Bishop of Verdun's projected monument to\r\nJeanne, and I sent him to Châtillon by telling him that the statue of\r\nUrban II. stands third in height among the religious monuments of Europe\r\nafter the Virgin of Le Puy and the St.-Charles of Arona.\r\n\r\nBourlémont before the Revolution must have been one of the finest\r\nchâteaux in France. It stands superbly on the plateau of a lofty hill.\r\nThe park which surrounds it is very extensive and full of noble trees.\r\nThe château was sacked and pillaged, and one great wing destroyed. This\r\nthe Prince d'Hénin is now rebuilding on the original scale, and in the\r\nmost perfect keeping with the stately and picturesque main body of the\r\nedifice. The whole of the interior, with the great hall and the chapel,\r\nhas been restored and refurnished with admirable taste. Carved oak\r\nwainscotings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, antique\r\narmoires and cabinets and tables, mediæval tapestries--nothing is\r\nwanting. But the thoroughness of the reconstruction emphasizes the\r\nwanton folly and wickedness of the devastation which made it necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse d'Hénin of the Revolutionary time narrowly escaped the\r\nguillotine. She was one of many women of rank and worth who owed their\r\nlives to the courage and ability and generosity of Madame de Staël.\r\nAfter taking refuge in Switzerland, Madame de Staël organised a complete\r\nsystem for bringing away her imperilled friends from Paris. She gathered\r\nabout her a small corps of clever and determined Swiss girls. These she\r\nsent one by one as occasion served, or circumstances required, into\r\nFrance, equipped with Swiss passports. On reaching Paris one of these\r\ngirls would find a lady waiting to escape, change wardrobes with her,\r\ngive her a Swiss passport properly viséd by the Swiss representative in\r\nParis, furnish her with money if necessary, and set her safely on her\r\nway to the Cantons. When news came that she had arrived, the Swiss\r\ndamsel in her turn would get a new passport from her Minister and return\r\nto Switzerland. Of course, such a system as this could not have been\r\ncarried out so successfully as it was without more or less co-operation\r\non the part of the 'incorruptible' Republican functionaries in France,\r\nand there can be little doubt that, under the régime of the scoundrels\r\nwho made up the Committee of Public Security--Lebon, Panis, Drouet,\r\nRuhl, and the rest--a regular traffic in passports and protections went\r\non during the worst times of the Terror. It is remembered to the credit\r\nof an unhappy woman, who was born in the town of Vaucouleurs, and for\r\nwhom nobody finds a good word, Madame Du Barry, that she deliberately\r\ngave up the certainty of securing her own escape from Paris, in 1793, in\r\norder to save Madame de Mortemart. The Duchesse de Mortemart was in\r\nhiding on the Channel coast, when Madame Du Barry, for whom a\r\nsafe-conduct under an assumed name had been bought from one of the\r\nTerrorist 'Titans,' insisted that this safe-conduct should be sent from\r\nParis to the Duchesse. The Duchesse used it and reached England in\r\nsafety. Madame Du Barry remained to perish on the scaffold, leaving her\r\ngoods and chattels to be stolen by the ruffians who sent her to the\r\nguillotine, just as the goods and chattels, the money and equipments and\r\nhorses of the Duc de Biron were stolen by the Republican 'General'\r\nRossignol, his successor.\r\n\r\nDomrémy is in the electoral district of Neufchâteau, and the elections\r\nof 1889 do not show that the 'laicization' policy has given the\r\nRepublican cause a great impulse in this region. The Monarchist\r\ncandidate in the Neufchâteau district received in September 1889 6,571\r\nvotes, and the Republican 6,590. This is one of the microscopic\r\nmajorities which were so common in 1889, and which conclusively show\r\nwhat a difference in the general result was made by the open pressure of\r\nthe Government on the electors. The Department of the Vosges sends up\r\nsix deputies to the Chamber. In 1885 it sent up a solid Republican\r\nDeputation, including M. Méline, who was so conspicuous in 1889 in the\r\nmatter of General Boulanger and M. Jules Ferry, the standard-bearer of\r\n'laicization' and irreligion. In 1885 the Deputies were chosen by the\r\n_scrutin de liste_. The Republican majority shown by the vote for M.\r\nMéline was 6,949 on a total poll of 87,635. M. Méline, who headed the\r\npoll, received 47,292 votes. His Conservative opponent received 40,343.\r\nIn 1889 the elections were made by the _scrutin d'arrondissement_. Five\r\nRepublicans, not six, were chosen, and the defeated Republican candidate\r\nwas no less a person than M. Jules Ferry himself! The first district of\r\nSt.-Dié gave him 6,192 votes, and elected a Monarchist to replace him by\r\n6,403 votes. It is not easy to overestimate the significance of this\r\nchange. Probably enough the majority will emphasize it by 'invalidating'\r\nthe election of the Monarchist!\r\n\r\nA comparison of the total votes in the Vosges of the two parties in 1889\r\nwith those of 1885 is instructive. In 1885 the strength, of the two\r\nparties respectively (the Conservatives not having then openly declared\r\nfor the Monarchy) was, as I have said, 47,292 and 40,343. In 1889 the\r\nRepublicans polled in all the districts of the department 47,116 votes,\r\nand their opponents 42,124. Here we have a falling off of 176 votes in\r\nthe highest Republican strength against an increase of 1,781 in the\r\nhighest Opposition strength, or, in other words, a falling off of 1,957\r\nvotes in the aggregate Republican majority, together with the defeat in\r\nhis own district of the recognised leader of the Republican Government\r\nparty. And yet the total of the votes polled rose from 87,635 in 1885 to\r\n89,240 in 1889. The inference is obvious: that the Monarchists are on\r\nthe upgrade, and the Republicans on the downgrade. If, with such results\r\nin such a region and in the face of such a contest as that of 1889, the\r\nMonarchists do not in the long run win, it will clearly be nobody's\r\nfault but their own!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nIN THE CALVADOS\r\n\r\n\r\n  VAL RICHER.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking illustration that can be given of the true\r\nnature of the contest now waging between the Third Republic and France,\r\nis the share taken in it by the family and the representatives of the\r\ngreat Protestant statesman, who, under Louis Philippe, laid down the\r\nlines in France of a truly free and liberal system of public education.\r\nIn the matter of education France was undoubtedly thrown backward and\r\nnot forward by the First Republic. The number of illiterates--that is,\r\nof persons unable to read and write--naturally increased between 1789\r\nand 1799 as the educational foundations which existed all over the\r\nkingdom shared the fate of the religious and charitable foundations.\r\nThere was an abundance of ordinances and decrees about public education.\r\nBut the chief practical work done was to confiscate the means by which\r\nthe ancient system had been carried on. Baudrillart mentions educational\r\nfoundations made by the great abbeys as early as in the seventh century.\r\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Councils of the French Church\r\ncreated in each cathedral chapter a special prebend, the holder of which\r\nwas to look after the education not only of clerical persons, but 'of\r\nall poor scholars,' and this 'gratuitously.'\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century lay foundations for free public education are\r\nfound, one in particular of importance established by a rich citizen,\r\nJean Rose, for promoting the general education of the people at Meaux,\r\nthe diocese afterwards of Bossuet, who under Louis XIV. was so active in\r\npromoting 'the moral unity' of France from his point of view.\r\n\r\nThe long English wars interrupted the development of education, and many\r\ninstances are found during that dismal period in which persons who had\r\nbought legal positions had to employ professional scribes to do their\r\nwriting. In the sixteenth century schools increased and multiplied all\r\nover France. Rich citizens founded them for 'the instruction of all the\r\nchildren,' as at Provins in 1509, and at Roissy-en-Buè in 1521. In the\r\nrural regions the schoolmaster often received his pay in grain; he was\r\nsometimes attached to some public office. In many places he taught the\r\nchildren only for six months in each year. In short, education was\r\ncarried on in France at that time very much as it was in the rural\r\nregions of the United States down to the second quarter of the current\r\ncentury. In many French parishes of the sixteenth century the\r\nschoolmaster 'boarded around' in the different families of the parish,\r\njust as he did in New England. The religious wars again disturbed the\r\ndevelopment of education. At Nîmes, where the archives I found had been\r\ncarefully investigated by M. Puech, more than a third of the artisans\r\ncould read, write, and keep their accounts at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. After the close of the religious wars, it was no uncommon thing\r\nto find fathers signing their names in a very clerkly fashion, while\r\ntheir sons were forced to 'make their marks,' as being unable to write.\r\nLike causes produced like effects at the end of the eighteenth century.\r\nNot content with disestablishing the Church, the legislative tinkers of\r\n1791, by a law passed on June 27 in that year, struck out of existence\r\nat a blow all the great industrial associations and corporations of\r\nFrance. These had provided for the education of the children of their\r\nmembers for centuries; but all the educational foundations were swept\r\naway with the hospitals and the charities. The men who grew to man's\r\nestate between 1793 and 1813 in France grew up in greater ignorance than\r\ntheir fathers.\r\n\r\nThe worst national effects of the Terror did not disappear with the\r\ndisappearance of the guillotine. Before the fall of Robespierre, the\r\nguillotine had come to be a financial expedient. 'We are coining money\r\non the Place de la Révolution,' said the estimable Barére to his\r\ncolleagues, and he counted that a poor week's work which yielded less\r\n'than three millions of francs' from the confiscation of the property of\r\nthe victims. When under the Directory _fusillades_ took the place of the\r\ntoo conspicuous guillotine, the confiscation still went on. The\r\nDirectory did no more for education than the Terror had done. The five\r\ndirectors had other matters on their minds.\r\n\r\nBarras, of whom a not unfriendly historian gently observes that, 'while\r\nhe lacked no other vice ancient or modern, he was neither very vain nor\r\nvery cruel;' Mr. Carlyle's 'hungry Parisian pleasure-hunter,' Rewbell,\r\nof whom his special friend and colleague, Laréveillère-Lepaux, amiably\r\nrecords in his Memoirs that 'his legs were too small for his body,' and\r\nthat he had 'a habit of attributing to himself speeches uttered and\r\ndeeds done by other people;' Letourneur, a corpulent rustic, whose\r\nexcellent wife loudly exulted over her joy in finding herself 'eating\r\nstewed beef out of Sèvres porcelain,' and who, being asked when he came\r\nback from the Jardin des Plantes whether he had seen Lacépède,\r\ninnocently replied: 'No; but I saw La giraffe!'--Carnot, 'Papa Victory,'\r\nof whom Laréveillère says that 'nobody could endure his vanity and\r\nself-conceit;' and, lastly, Laréveillère himself, whom Carnot in his\r\nMemoirs, published at London in 1799, compares to a 'viper,' and says,\r\n'after he has made a speech he coils himself up again'--these were\r\nhardly the men to give their nights and days to reconstructing the\r\neducational system of France!\r\n\r\nMerlin (of Douai), Minister of Justice under the quintette, really ruled\r\nFrance for nearly five years. This was Merlin, author of the 'Law of the\r\nSuspects,' which Mr. Carlyle, though obviously in the dark as to its\r\nreal genesis and objects, finds himself constrained to stigmatize as the\r\n'frightfullest law that ever ruled in a nation of men.' Mr. Carlyle does\r\nnot seem to have observed that the author of this 'transcendental' law,\r\nthe aim of which was to convert the French people into a swarm of spies\r\nand assassins, was not only one of the first of the Republican' Titans'\r\nto fall down and kiss the feet of Napoleon, but one of the first also to\r\ndesert Napoleon, and embrace the knees of the returning King. On April\r\n11, 1814, this creature, who had caused the Convention to reject a\r\npetition for a pardon presented by a man condemned for a crime, the real\r\nauthors of which had confessed his innocence and their own guilt, on the\r\nground that 'every sentence pronounced by the law should be\r\nirrevocable,' joined in a most fulsome address of welcome to the\r\nlegitimate sovereign of France! His namesake Merlin (of Thionville),\r\nanother 'Titan' whom Mr. Carlyle admires as riding out of captured\r\nMayence still 'threatening in defeat,' was nimbler even than Merlin of\r\nDouai. On April 7, 1814, he wrote to King Louis begging to be allowed\r\n'to serve the true, paternal government of France!'\r\n\r\nConcerning Merlin (of Douai), Barras, who made him 'Minister of\r\nJustice,' placidly says: 'Poltroons are always cruel. Merlin always hid\r\nhimself in the moment of danger, and came out again only to strike the\r\nvanquished party.' Proscription and confiscation kept the Government\r\nwhich this worthy Republican directed much too busy to leave it any time\r\nfor looking after the schools of France.\r\n\r\nWhen at last Napoleon gathered up the reins, he postponed the interests\r\nof public education to other, and from his point of view more pressing,\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\nThe Concordat re-established the Church in France, but it did not\r\nre-endow the Church on a scale which would have enabled it at once to\r\nreconstruct its own educational system. In fact, the Concordat can\r\nhardly be said to have re-endowed the Church at all. Under the\r\nthirteenth article the Pope formally recognized the title of the\r\npurchasers of 'national property' in France to vast domains, the\r\nproperty through purchase, donations, or bequest of the Church, which\r\nhad been made 'national property' only by the simple processes of\r\nexiling or murdering the owners and confiscating their estates. In\r\nconsideration of this recognition, the State bound itself by Article\r\nXIV. of the Concordat to 'ensure to the bishops and the curates salaries\r\nbefitting their functions,' and by Article XV. to 'protect the right of\r\nthe Catholics of France to re-endow the churches.'\r\n\r\nAs to the 'rising generation' of the French people the government of\r\nNapoleon concerned itself much more with the conscription than with the\r\nreconstruction of the schools, and though the Churches, both Catholic\r\nand Protestant, took this work in hand very early in the century, it was\r\nnecessarily with inadequate means.\r\n\r\nUnder the First Consulate a general law regulating public instruction\r\nwas enacted, on May 1, 1802. Another was enacted shortly afterwards,\r\nand in 1808 appeared the famous decree of the Emperor founding the\r\nUniversity system of France. Heaven knows how many schemes for founding\r\nthis University system had been elaborated and submitted to him before,\r\nonly to be torn up as 'ideological.' Cuvier affirms that he drew up\r\ntwenty-three such schemes one after another.\r\n\r\nThis decree of March 17, 1808, forbade the establishment of private\r\nschools without the authority of the Government, set up three degrees of\r\npublic instruction, primary, secondary and superior, organised a body of\r\nInspectors-General, and, in short, 'laicized' public education in France\r\neffectually as a machine to be controlled by the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\nUnder the ancient Monarchy, France possessed twenty-four Universities.\r\nThe Convention suppressed them all at a blow on September 15, 1793. This\r\nwas little more than three months after the Convention itself had been\r\n'suppressed' and forced to kiss the hand that smote it by Henriot and\r\nhis cannoniers on June 28, 1793. A law abolishing the freedom of\r\neducation was to have been expected from an assembly itself enslaved by\r\nan oligarchy of rogues and assassins. And this law left nothing standing\r\nin France to impede the execution of the Imperial decree of 1808, the\r\nfirst article of which was:--'Public education in the whole Empire is\r\nexclusively confided to the University.' Another article ordained that\r\nall the schools in France should take as the basis of their instruction\r\n'fidelity to the Emperor, to the Imperial monarchy, the trustee of the\r\nhappiness of the people, and to the Napoleonic dynasty, the conservator\r\nof the unity of France and of all the liberal ideas proclaimed in the\r\nconstitutions of France.' The theology of all the French schools was to\r\nbe in conformity with the Royal edict of Louis XIV., issued in 1682.\r\nFurthermore and expressly, 'the members of the University were required\r\nto keep the Grand-master and his officers informed of anything that may\r\ncome to their knowledge contrary to the doctrine and the principles of\r\nthe educational body in the establishments of public education!'\r\n\r\nHere we have the 'moral unity' of France organized by Napoleon in 1808\r\non the lines in which the Third Republic has been trying ever since 1874\r\nto organize it! Put the word 'Republic' for the word 'Empire,' the\r\nphrase 'scientific atheism' for the phrase 'propositions of the clergy\r\nof France in 1682,' and you have in the Napoleonic organization of\r\npublic education the organization controlled by M. Jules Ferry. Of the\r\ntwo despotisms, the despotism of 1808 seems to me the more compatible\r\nwith public order and public prosperity. With public liberty neither of\r\nthem is compatible. Under the ancient Monarchy and the clerical system\r\nof education liberty existed. The Jesuits and the Jansenists, the\r\nDominicans and the Oratorians and the Benedictines, had their different\r\nprinciples of education, their different traditions, their different\r\ntext-books. Under the Imperial University, and still more under the\r\nUniversity of the Third Republic, differences became disloyalties. Under\r\nthe University of France in 1808 every young French citizen was to\r\naccept the Catholic faith as defined by the clergy of France in 1682,\r\nand true allegiance bear to the Napoleonic dynasty. Under the University\r\nof France in 1890, every young French citizen is to disbelieve in God\r\nand a future life, and true allegiance bear to the Third French\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 as in 1890 the rights of freemen were first vindicated in this\r\nconnection by the Catholic Church. On April 9, 1809, the Emperor issued\r\na decree that no one should be admitted to a Catholic theological\r\nacademy without a bachelor's diploma of the University. The bishops came\r\nat once into collision on this point with the Imperial prefects of 1809,\r\nas the bishops now came into collision on the decree of 1880 with M.\r\nJules Ferry and the Republican prefects. The Imperial prefects of 1809\r\n(not a few of them rabid Republicans in 1792) were merely the valets of\r\nthe Emperor, as the prefects of 1890 are the valets of a Parliamentary\r\noligarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor carried his point. But when the Emperor fell, and the\r\nconstitutional monarchy was restored, the University of France ceased to\r\nbe an Imperialist training-school. M. de Fontanes, appointed\r\ngrand-master by the Emperor in 1809, kept his place under Louis XVIII.\r\nTo keep it he made the University 'clerical.' Under Napoleon the\r\nscholars in the public schools of France had been divided into\r\n'companies.' M. de Fontanes in 1815 ordered them to be divided into\r\n'classes.' Under Napoleon the hours of study and of play were announced\r\nby a drum. In 1815 M. de Fontanes ordered them to be announced by a\r\nbell. Under Napoleon the boys all wore a uniform. M. de Fontanes in 1815\r\nordered the uniforms to be no longer of 'a military type.' Then the\r\nFrench Liberals who had not dared to stir under the Emperor began to\r\nattack both the clergy and the University. But when the Revolution of\r\n1830 brought these 'Liberals' into power, they ceased at once to attack,\r\nand began at once to engineer the Imperial machinery of the University.\r\nM. Thiers even proclaimed this machinery to be 'the finest creation of\r\nthe reign of Napoleon!'\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the truest Liberal of them all, M. Guizot, struck a strenuous\r\nblow at this machinery of despotism. He could not deal with the\r\nUniversity as a system, but he framed a law affecting 'primary\r\neducation,' the principle of winch was that no man should be forced to\r\nsend his child to school, but that schools should exist all over France\r\nto which any man who pleased might send his children if he was too poor\r\nto pay for their education.\r\n\r\nThis principle of M. Guizot in 1883 was certainly not an outcome of the\r\n'principles of 1789;' for it had been at the foundation of all the free\r\nschools of France during the middle ages, and under the absolute\r\nmonarchy of Louis XIV. Talleyrand recognised it in his plan of 1791,\r\nwhich did not suit Condorcet and his 'ideologists.' It was not in the\r\nmere revival of this principle that the true liberalism of M. Guizot\r\nmanifested itself. In the second article of his law this great statesman\r\nprovided, in express terms, that 'the wishes of families should always\r\nbe consulted and complied with in everything affecting the religious\r\ninstruction of their children.' This was indeed a step far forward in\r\nthe path of true liberalism. It was a distinct recognition of the rights\r\nof the family as against the encroachments of the State. It was the\r\n'liberalism' not of the 'ideologists' of 1790, nor of the Third Republic\r\naccording to M. Challemel-Lacour, but of the legislators who gave Lower\r\nCanada her equitable system of common and of dissident schools. It was\r\nthe liberalism of those courageous men who, like Montgaillard, Bishop of\r\nSt.-Pons, had dared, under Louis XIV., and after the revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes, to protest in 1688 against imposing the Catholic\r\ncommunion by force upon the Huguenot ancestors of M. Guizot.\r\n\r\nAs Minister of Public Instruction under Louis Philippe in 1833, this\r\nlover of true liberty simply got enacted into law the principles which\r\nhad led him as a brilliant and rising young man of letters in 1812 to\r\nrefuse to adulate the Emperor, and which he had plainly and fearlessly\r\nset forth as the necessary conditions of the constitutional government\r\nof France in his famous interview with Louis XVIII. three years\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nUnder M. Guizot's law of 1833, the primary schools of France were much\r\nmore than doubled in number during the reign of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of that law M. Guizot administered the affairs of France\r\nduring his long tenure of official authority, and to him, more than to\r\nany other man, must be attributed the progress which France made under\r\nLouis Philippe in the direction of liberty, as Englishmen and Americans\r\nunderstand that much-abused word. That progress might never have been\r\ninterrupted had the counsels of M. Guizot prevailed over those of M.\r\nThiers with the aged monarch who trusted the one but yielded to the\r\nother, in February 1848.\r\n\r\nNow that a parliamentary oligarchy has deliberately undertaken, in the\r\nname of the 'moral unity of France,' to undo all that was done between\r\n1833 and 1848 for educational liberty in France and to protect the moral\r\nindependence of Frenchmen, it is in the highest degree interesting to\r\nfind the principles of M. Guizot energetically maintained by the heirs\r\nof his blood and of his name, not only here in the Catholic Calvados\r\nwhich gave the great Protestant statesman so staunch a support through\r\nall his years of power, and surrounded him with affection and respect\r\ndown to the last days of his long and illustrious life, but in Southern\r\nFrance also, and in the home of his Protestant ancestors.\r\n\r\nVal Richer will be a place of pilgrimage for lovers of liberty in the\r\ntwentieth century, as La Brède is in the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nBut the genius of the spot is more purely personal in the home of\r\nGuizot than in the birthplace of Montesquieu.\r\n\r\nThe stately rectangular library at La Brède with its thousands of\r\nsoberly-clad volumes, standing as he left them on its shelves, annotated\r\nby his own hand; the manuscripts still unfinished of the 'Lettres\r\nPersanes; the grave silent cabinet, with his chair beside his\r\nstudy-table, as if he had quitted it a moment before you came--all these\r\nare eloquent, indeed, of the great thinker whose 'Esprit des Lois,' too\r\nrich in ripe wisdom to be heeded by the headlong and haphazard political\r\n'plungers' of 1789 in his own country, illuminated for Washington the\r\nproblem of constituting a new nationality beyond the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nBut La Brède has also a positive physiognomy of its own which takes you\r\nback to ages long before his birth. The frowning donjon of the\r\nthirteenth century, the machicolated round tower, the moat with its\r\nrunning water, the drawbridge, the vestibule with its columns of twisted\r\noak, even the grand salon with the stately courtiers and captains, the\r\ngracious dames and damsels of the family of Sécondat gazing down from\r\nthe walls, all these distract the eye and the mind. The distraction is\r\nagreeable, but still it is a distraction. It leads you from the\r\nbiographical into the social and historical mood. You are delighted as\r\nat Meillant or Chenonceaux with a corner of ancient France, marvellously\r\nrescued from the red ruin of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nVal Richer, on the contrary, like Abbotsford, is the creation of the\r\nmaster whose spirit haunts the place. Like Abbotsford, it has an earlier\r\nhistory and older associations, but of these there are few or no\r\nmaterial signs. Here stood the great abbey of which Thomas à-Becket once\r\nwas abbot, and where he found a refuge during that exile from which, in\r\nhis own words, he went back to England 'to play a game in which the\r\nstakes were heads!' From Bures, near Bayeux, in this department, where\r\nHenry was then holding his court, the four knights followed the Primate\r\nto Canterbury, sternly bent on showing their lord that they were neither\r\n'sluggish nor half-hearted.' Of the abbatial buildings which stood here\r\nthen few traces are left. But the handsome modern mansion built here by\r\nGuizot rests, I believe, on the massive foundations, and certainly\r\nincorporates some of the solid masonry above ground of the ancient\r\nabbot's house. The drive to Val Richer from the singularly picturesque\r\nold Norman town of Lisieux, within whose cathedral walls Henry of\r\nEngland was married to Eleanor of Guienne, is beautifully shaded all the\r\nway with noble trees, and bordered on either hand with parks and\r\ngardens. No English county can show a more strikingly English\r\nlandscape--for this is the mother-country of Norman England, though now\r\none of the main pillars of the nationality of France. The Lady Chapel of\r\nthe Cathedral at Lisieux, indeed, was founded in the fifteenth century\r\nby Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, in express expiation of the 'false\r\njudgment on an innocent woman,' by which, as he lamentably confessed in\r\nhis deed of gift, he had sent the deliverer of France to the stake at\r\nRouen.\r\n\r\nThe park, like the mansion of Val Richer, is the creation of M. Guizot.\r\nThe monks of old had prepared the ground--for here, as everywhere, they\r\nkept alive the traditions of Roman landscape art. The parks which the\r\nNorman nobles made on both sides of the Channel were mainly devoted to\r\nthe chase, like the 'paradises' of the Persians; but the monasteries\r\npossessed pleasure-grounds and gardens of all sorts. The beautifully\r\nbroken and undulating surface of the park of Val Richer attests, I\r\nthink, the fashioning hand of human art at more than one point; and M.\r\nGuizot, by whom most of the fine trees which now adorn the place were\r\nplanted, took advantage, with the skill of a professional landscapist,\r\nof all the opportunities it offered him.\r\n\r\nI can well believe, with the most accomplished and appreciative of his\r\nEnglish biographers, that the years which he passed here after his\r\nreturn from the exile into which he was driven by the unhappy\r\ninterference of M. Thiers at the most critical moment of the\r\ndisturbances of February 1848, were the happiest of his long and\r\nwell-filled life.\r\n\r\nThe halls and corridors of the mansion are tapestried with books. The\r\ngreen secluded alleys, the gentle knolls, the glades, the spacious\r\nmeadows of the park, recall at every step the younger Pliny's\r\nincomparable picture of his Tuscan villa. '_Placida omnia et\r\nquiescentia._' 'A spirit of pensive peace broods over the whole place,\r\nmaking it not lovelier only, but more salubrious, making the sky more\r\npure, the atmosphere more clear.'\r\n\r\nPeople who imagine convulsions and cataclysms to be a necessity of\r\npolitical life in France, will find it hard to explain the relations\r\nwhich existed throughout his whole career from the time when he took\r\npart in forming the first government of Louis Philippe to the day of his\r\ndeath between this great Protestant statesman and the Catholics of the\r\nCalvados. These relations still exist between his representatives at Val\r\nRicher and the Catholics of the Calvados.\r\n\r\nWhen the great Chancellor de l'Hôpital was using all his influence with\r\nCatherine de' Medici to prevent the outbreak of the religious wars of\r\nthe sixteenth century, the Parisian rabble were set on by the satellites\r\nof the House of Guise to attack the house of the Sieur de Longjumeau in\r\nthe Pré aux Clercs, as being a place of meeting for the Huguenots. The\r\nSieur de Longjumeau had no respect for the 'sacred right of\r\ninsurrection,' and, getting some of his friends into his house, gave the\r\npeople risen in their majesty such a thrashing that they speedily\r\ndisbanded. Upon this the 'moral unity' men of that time induced the\r\nCourt to banish the Sieur de Longjumeau to his estates, on the ground\r\nthat 'the most incompatible thing in a State is the existence of two\r\nforms of religion.' This is the doctrine of the Third Republic to-day.\r\nFrance cannot live with a mixed population of believers and of\r\nunbelievers. All Frenchmen must be Atheists. The political history of\r\nthe Calvados for the last half-century, and especially of this region\r\nabout Lisieux and Val Richer, meets this 'moral unity' theory with a\r\npractical demonstration of its absurdity. The great Protestant statesman\r\nand his Catholic constituents at Lisieux lived and worked together for\r\nliberty and for law, not in 'moral unity,' but in moral harmony. In\r\nmoral harmony his Protestant son-in-law, M. Conrad de Witt, through a\r\nquarter of a century past has lived and worked for liberty and for law\r\nwith his Catholic constituents of Pont-l'Evêque.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics of the Calvados are not such intense Catholics as the\r\nCatholics of Brittany and Poitou. After the Norman rising of 1793\r\nagainst the tyranny at Paris had collapsed so dismally in the ridiculous\r\n'battle' of Pacy--a battle which began with the flight in a panic from\r\nthe field of the vanquished Normans, and ended with the flight in a\r\npanic from the field of their victorious enemies the Parisians--the\r\nindignant Bretons and the Poitevins marched away to wage that contest\r\nfor their homes and their altars which has immortalized the name of La\r\nVendée. The less impassioned Normans made terms and took things as they\r\nwere. To this day what is called the 'little Church' exists in Brittany,\r\nmade up of peasants who regard the Concordat as an unworthy compact made\r\nwith the persecutors and the plunderers of the Church of their fathers.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the Norman Catholics after Pacy and the miserable failure\r\nof the Girondist resistance to the Mountain took the form of silent\r\ndisgust with the Republic and all its works. The Norman heroine in whose\r\nheart this silent disgust named up till it made her the avenger of\r\ninnocent blood upon the most noisome reptile of the Revolution, had\r\nceased to be a Catholic before the shame of her country moved her to her\r\nglorious and dreadful deed. But if the Catholics of the Calvados are\r\nless intense, they are not less sincere, than the Catholics of Brittany\r\nor Poitou. It is no indifference in matters of religion which makes them\r\nco-operate so cordially with their Protestant friends and\r\nrepresentatives. It is because they value their religion, and mean that\r\nit shall be respected, that they honour the memory of the great minister\r\nwho held sacred and inviolable the right of the parent to be heard and\r\nobeyed in the matter of the religious education of his children. The two\r\ndaughters of M. Guizot married two brothers, the heirs of one of the\r\nmost illustrious names in the annals of European liberty. One of these\r\nbrothers, M. Conrad de Witt, now lives at Val Richer, and administers\r\nhis large agricultural property lying there in the commune of\r\nSt.-Ouen-le-Pin. Many years ago he won the gold medal of the French\r\nSociety of Agriculture, and for twenty years past he has been President\r\nof the Agricultural Society of Pont-l'Evêque. In 1861, under the Empire,\r\nhis fellow-citizens made him a Councillor-General for the Canton of\r\nCambremer, in the Department of the Calvados, and he has kept his seat\r\nin that body ever since, until he last year declined a re-election, and\r\nmade way for the candidacy of his nephew, M. Pierre de Witt. It was my\r\ngood fortune to be at Val Richer when the election came off. The canvass\r\nhad been carefully pushed; for, although the Republicans ostentatiously\r\nannounced their intention not to make a contest in which they were sure\r\nto be beaten, M. Conrad de Witt and his nephew are not men to take\r\nanything for granted where serious interests are concerned. There were\r\nsymptoms, too, that the Prefect of the Calvados, the Comte de Brancion,\r\na newcomer (as all prefects now are in France, the average tenure of a\r\nprefect's official life since 1879 rarely exceeding eighteen months\r\nin one place), had been advised from Paris to show his zeal by\r\ncontriving in some way to thwart, or at least to dampen, the victory of\r\nthe nephew in July, as a preliminary to prevent the victory of the uncle\r\nin September. For M. Conrad de Witt was not only a Councillor-General of\r\nthe Calvados, and Mayor of his own commune of St.-Ouen-le-Pin, he was\r\nsent to the Chamber of Deputies in 1885 as a Monarchist by the voters of\r\nthe Calvados by a majority of 13,722 on a total poll of 89,064, and when\r\nhe declined a re-nomination for the Council-General, he accepted a\r\nre-nomination for the Chamber.\r\n\r\nIt was delightful to see the zealous interest taken in these contests,\r\nnot only by the family at Val Richer, but by all the countryside. The\r\nelections for the Councils-General were held on Sunday, July 28, 1889.\r\nAll through the preceding Saturday scouts kept coming in to Val Richer\r\nwith the latest reports as to the state of things in the various\r\ncommunes of the canton.\r\n\r\nThe tenor of these was uniform: 'There would be no contest; the only\r\npossible Republican candidate, a respectable physician who had some\r\nlocal strength in the commune in which he lived, founded upon his habit\r\nof gratuitously attending the poor of that commune, had positively\r\ndeclined to enter the field.' 'All the same,' said one energetic\r\nvolunteer from this very commune, 'we don't mean to let a single honest\r\nvoter stay at home. We understand this game. They want to make out that\r\nwe are lukewarm about the battle that is to come off in September. That\r\nwon't go!'\r\n\r\n'Furthermore,' said another stalwart, keen-eyed, fresh-faced young\r\nfarmer, who might have passed as a Yorkshire yeoman, 'furthermore, I\r\ndon't trust this Republican cock till he's dead! I believe he's\r\nshamming, but he shan't catch us asleep. This Prefect at Caen is as busy\r\nas the Evil One. He means to play us a trick.'\r\n\r\nThe shrewd young farmer was right. Early, very early, on Sunday morning,\r\nlong before daybreak, indeed, there came hastening over to Val Richer\r\nfrom the commume of Bonnebosq, some miles away, a spirited young fellow,\r\nheart and soul in the fight, with the news that a story was putting\r\nabout all over the canton that M. Pierre de Witt had decided, at the\r\nlast moment, not to stand, and that, on the strength of this invention,\r\nthe nomination of Dr. ---- would be urged.\r\n\r\nThe polling had been fixed by the Prefect to begin in all the communes\r\nat 7 A.M., and to close at 6 P.M. No time was, therefore, to be lost in\r\ngetting out a formal contradiction of this invention of the enemy, and\r\nthe vigorous young volunteer from Bonnebosq had lost no time. He roused\r\nthe candidate, got his instructions, and, before the polls were opened,\r\nhis men were all over the canton at work. In the course of the day I\r\ndrove over with M. Pierre de Witt to Bonnebosq, where we found the\r\nmother of this energetic young politician, a typical Norman mother, full\r\nof sense and fire, quietly proud of the activity and intelligence of her\r\nson, and quite as much in the day's work as he. 'Not a pretty trick,'\r\nshe said, 'to play with Dr.----. He ought to be ashamed of it--and I am\r\nsure he is,' she added, with a droll twinkle in her eye, 'for it has\r\nturned out very badly! He will just be beaten like plaster. It would\r\nhave been cleverer to behave like a decent man!' Bonnebosq had a very\r\nlively, cheery aspect on that Sunday afternoon. It is a busy prosperous\r\nlittle place, with about a thousand inhabitants. The village church, a\r\nnew and very handsome French ogival building, most creditable to the\r\narchitect, has just been built at an expense of several hundred thousand\r\nfrancs by a Catholic lady of the canton, and the people are very proud\r\nof it. It struck me that at Bonnebosq the outlook for a moral harmony\r\nbetween Frenchmen of divers religious communions contending together for\r\nequal rights and well-ordered liberty was decidedly better than the\r\noutlook for a 'moral unity' of France to be promoted by the\r\nauthoritative suppression of all private initiative in the education of\r\nthe French people. The traditions of the Norman race do not tend kindly\r\ntowards a system under which the individual is to wither that the State\r\nmay be more and more!\r\n\r\nAs Mayor of the commune of St.-Ouen-le-Pin, M. Conrad de Witt had a busy\r\nday of it on Sunday, July 28. The holding of elections on Sunday is a\r\ntradition in France. Two elections were to be made--one of a\r\nCouncillor-General and the other of a District Councillor. Under the\r\nlaws of 1871 and 1874, these elections must be held in separate though\r\nadjoining buildings wherever this is practicable. Where the commune is\r\ntoo small to furnish these facilities, the two elections may be held in\r\none place; but the votes for the two officers must be deposited in two\r\ndifferent urns. These urns are placed upon a table, at which the Mayor\r\nof the commune presides with four assessors and a secretary, chosen by\r\nthem from among the electors. As the electors have the day before them,\r\nthe Mayor and the assessors are kept close prisoners at their posts till\r\nthe polls are closed. Nor is their work over then. As soon as the clock\r\nstrikes 6 P.M. the doors of the bureau close. But the Mayor and\r\nthe assessors must then proceed 'immediately' to examine and establish\r\nthe results of the voting. They choose from among the electors present a\r\ncertain number of 'scrutineers' knowing how to read and write. These\r\nscrutineers take their seats at tables prepared for the purpose. At each\r\ntable there must be at least four scrutineers. The Mayor and the\r\nassessors then empty the urns and count the votes, the secretary drawing\r\nup a _procès-verbal_ the while. If there are more or fewer votes than\r\nthere were voters registered during the day as voting, this fact is\r\nstated and affirmed. Blank or illegible votes, votes which do not\r\naccurately give the name of the candidate voted for, or on which the\r\nvoters have put their own names, are not counted as valid, but they are\r\nannexed to the _procès-verbal_. Votes not written on white paper, or\r\nwhich bear any external indication of their tenor, are included in the\r\naccount as votes affecting the majority necessary to a choice, but they\r\nare not put to the credit of the candidate whose name they bear; so\r\nthat, as a matter of fact, they tell against him. Moreover, if there are\r\nmore votes found in the urns than voters registered as voting, the\r\nexcess may be deducted from the number of votes given to the candidate\r\nwho has a majority.\r\n\r\nI asked a very bright ruddy farmer in a spotless blue blouse, who was\r\nwatching the elections with great interest in one of the communes, what\r\nhe thought of this provision. 'It is a very good reason for watching the\r\nmayors,' he said; '_dame_! a clever mayor who knows his commune, and has\r\ngood loose sleeves to his coat, can slip in a good many votes in this\r\nway against the candidate who he knows is likely to win!'\r\n\r\nI told him that in my own country we guarded the palladium of our\r\nliberties (a queer palladium that needs to be guarded) against this\r\nperil by using glass globes instead of the 'urns' employed in France,\r\nwhich are in fact wooden boxes. The idea delighted him. He rubbed his\r\nhands together with a chuckle, and said 'That would be capital! That\r\nwould bother them! But for that reason we shall not have your glass\r\nurns!'\r\n\r\nWhen the votes have all been emptied out of the urns and verified and\r\ncounted by the Mayor and the assessors, the Mayor distributes them among\r\nthe scrutineers. At each table a scrutineer takes the votes up one by\r\none, reads out in a clear voice the name of the candidate inscribed on\r\neach vote, and passes it to another scrutineer, who sees it duly\r\nregistered, the Mayor and assessors the while supervising all the\r\nproceeding. In communes containing less than 300 inhabitants the Mayor\r\nand assessors themselves may scrutinise and declare the results.\r\n\r\nAs St.-Ouen-le-Pin falls just two short of this number, M. Conrad de\r\nWitt not only lost his luncheon but his dinner. He never got back to the\r\nchâteau till ten o'clock at night.\r\n\r\nThe polling place in this commune was a small house opposite the village\r\nchurch. I walked over to it after breakfast through the fields and by\r\nlovely green lanes as deep as the lanes of Devonshire, with M. Pierre de\r\nWitt and one of his kinsmen. The mass was going on in the village\r\nchurch, and the singing of the choir seemed to me at least as fitting an\r\naccompaniment to the expression by the sovereign people of their\r\nsovereign will through bits of white paper--Mr. Whittier's 'noiseless\r\nsnowflakes'--as the braying of a brass band, or the hoarse shouts of a\r\nmore or less tipsy multitude.\r\n\r\nIn the Protestant corner of this Catholic churchyard, under some fine\r\ntrees, M. Guizot sleeps his last sleep in the simple tomb of his family.\r\nHere, again, I thought, was a moral harmony better than any 'moral\r\nunity'!\r\n\r\nWe had a merry and an animated dinner that night at Val Richer. Message\r\nafter message was brought in from the nearest communes, all of one\r\ntenor. The Republican 'trick' had evidently exasperated the worthy\r\nNorman voters, and brought them up to the polls most effectually! By ten\r\no'clock it was clear that M. Pierre de Witt was elected by a majority\r\ntoo large to be 'whittled' away, and that the surreptitious appearance\r\nof the Republicans in the field had served only to emphasize their\r\npolitical weakness. In the canton, Cambremer itself, lying at a distance\r\nof eight or ten kilomètres, and Beuvron only remained to be heard from.\r\nIt was possible harm might have been done there. For a law passed under\r\nthe Empire in 1852, and undisturbed for obvious reasons by the Third\r\nRepublic, allows the prefect of a department to determine into what\r\nsections he will divide a large commune for the purpose, according to\r\nthe law, of 'bringing the electors nearer to the electoral urn.' This\r\nopens the way, of course, to a good deal of what in America would be\r\nknown as official 'gerrymandering.' The thing may be of any country. The\r\nname we owe to Mr. Elbridge Gerry, once Vice-President of the United\r\nStates; who, when his party controlled Massachusetts, devised a scheme\r\nfor so framing the electoral districts of that State as to get his\r\nscattered party minorities together, and convert them thus into\r\nmajorities. An outline map of the State thus districted was declared by\r\none of his opponents to 'look like a salamander.' 'No! not like a\r\nsalamander,' said another; 'it is a gerrymander.'\r\n\r\nVal Richer was full of little fairies in that bright summer weather. The\r\nPied Piper of Hamelin must have passed that way, losing some stragglers\r\nof his army as he moved along. Wherever you strolled in the park you\r\ncame unexpectedly upon little blonde heads and laughing eyes peering\r\nthrough the shrubbery, and saw small imps scampering madly off across\r\nthe meadows. On the Sunday night of the election, music and mirth chased\r\nthe hours away, till, just after midnight, a joyous clamour in the outer\r\nhall announced some event of importance. From the far-off Cambremer and\r\nBeuvron-sur-Auge a delegation of staunch electors had arrived to\r\nannounce the crowning victory. Thanks to the distance and the\r\n'sections,' the votes had been long in counting, but they had been\r\ncounted, and not found wanting. One of these bringers of good tidings\r\nmight have sat or stood for a statue of William the Conqueror preparing\r\nto make France pay dearly for the jest of the French King anent his\r\ncolossal bulk. He was a man in the prime of life, but he cannot possibly\r\nhave weighed less than 400 pounds. Yet he moved about alertly, and he\r\nhad driven over in a light wagon at full speed (the Norman horses are\r\nvery strong) to congratulate his candidate on the issue of a fray in\r\nwhich he had borne his own part most manfully. M. Pierre de Witt had\r\nreceived 1,042 votes as Councillor-General, against no more than 140\r\ngiven to his medical competitor!\r\n\r\nOne bold voter had deposited a single vote for General Boulanger! 'Had\r\nthere been any disturbances anywhere?' No, none at all. 'We cheered when\r\nwe got the returns,' said the giant; 'we cheered for M. de Witt, and we\r\ncried \"Vive le Roi!\" They didn't like it, but they were so badly beaten,\r\nthey kept quiet. I believe though,' he added, 'they would have arrested\r\nus if we had cried \"Vive Bocher!\" That is more than they can bear!' and\r\ntherewith he laughed aloud, a not unkindly, but formidable laugh.\r\n\r\nM. Bocher, who was made Prefect of the Calvados by M. Guizot, and who is\r\nnow a senator for that department, is, I am assured, the special _bête\r\nnoire_ of the Third Republic in Normandy. His long and honourable\r\nconnection with the public service has won for him the esteem of all the\r\npeople of the Calvados, while his thorough knowledge of the political\r\nhistory of the country and of his time, his cool clear judgment, his\r\ntemperate but fearless assertion through good and evil report of his\r\npolitical convictions, and his keen insight into character, must give\r\nhim long odds in any contest with the ill-trained and miserably-equipped\r\npolitical camp-followers who have been coming of late years into the\r\nfront of the Republican battle.\r\n\r\nThey gave M. Bocher a banquet not long ago at Pont-l'Evêque, at which he\r\nmade a very telling speech, and brought down the house by inviting his\r\nhearers to contemplate M. Grévy and M. Carnot as typical illustrations\r\nof the great superiority of a republic over a monarchy, and of the\r\nelective over the hereditary principle! The Republicans, he said, had\r\ntwice elected to the chief magistracy an austerely virtuous Republican\r\nwhom they had finally been compelled to throw out at the window of the\r\nElysée, as 'the complaisant and guilty witness, if not the interested\r\naccomplice, of scandals which revolted the public conscience!' And whom\r\nhad the elective principle put into his place, under the pressure of\r\nirreconcilable personal rivalries, and of a threatened popular outbreak?\r\nA man whose recommendations were his own relative personal obscurity and\r\nthe traditional reputation of his grandfather!\r\n\r\nWith M. Grévy and M. Carnot the Norman farmers have a special quarrel\r\nwhich gave zest to the caustic periods of M. Bocher. The all-powerful\r\nson-in-law of M. Grévy, M. Wilson, proposed in the National Assembly in\r\n1872, and with the influence of M. Thiers, then President, succeeded in\r\npassing a law heavily taxing, and in an inquisitorial fashion, the\r\ndomestic fabrication of spirits. This is an old and prosperous industry\r\nin Normandy. It is carried on, according to an official estimate made in\r\n1888, by above five hundred thousand farmers in France; and in Normandy\r\nparticularly, a land of apples and pears, it is a great resource of the\r\nfarmers. They make here a liquor called Calvados, which when it attains\r\na certain age is much more drinkable and much less unwholesome than most\r\nof the casual cognac of our times. After three years this very unpopular\r\nlaw was repealed in 1875, mainly through the efforts of M. Bocher. It\r\nhad plagued the farmers more than it benefited the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe _bouilleurs de cru_, as these domestic distillers are called, had\r\nmade during the three years 1869-72, 1,199,000 hectolitres of spirits\r\nwhich paid excise duties. During the three years 1872-75 under the\r\nWilson law the production fell to about 165,000 hectolitres a year. In\r\nthe first year, 1875-76, after the repeal of the law it rose to 301,000\r\nhectolitres.\r\n\r\nThe sale of crosses of the Legion, official contracts and other\r\noperations not consistent with that virtue on which alone Montesquieu\r\ntells us a republic can safely repose, made an end of M. Wilson and of\r\nhis father-in-law. But the enormous Republican deficit kept on\r\nincreasing, and in 1888, under the presidency of M. Carnot, the\r\nRepublicans revived a project formed by M. Carnot when Minister of\r\nFinance, in 1886, for imposing upon the _bouilleurs de cru_ anew the\r\nsevere and inquisitorial taxation of 1872. Under the law introduced to\r\neffect this, January 12, 1888, the whole of the buildings in which any\r\npart of the processes of this production may be carried on must be open\r\nto the tax-officers _at all hours of the day or night_. As many of the\r\n_bouilleurs de cru_ are small farmers who use part of their houses for\r\nsome of these processes, it may be imagined how bitterly they oppose\r\nsuch a law. They have no more love for tax-gatherers than the people of\r\nother countries have; but the English maxim that every man's house is\r\nhis castle is a distinctly Norman maxim, and this menace offered to the\r\nsanctity and privacy of the domicile has profoundly exasperated the\r\nNorman populations. It is of a piece, they think, with the arbitrary\r\nschool system and with the elaborate contrivances devised to deprive the\r\ncommunes of the right finally to certify and give effect to the returns\r\nof their own elections. Above all, it is an interference with an ancient\r\nand customary right. 'What business have these lawyers and doctors at\r\nParis,' said a farmer here to me, 'to be meddling with our usages and\r\nways here on our lands in Normandy? Let them fix general taxes, and\r\nleave us to pay them in our own way!'\r\n\r\nThe war against the Church affects these Normans in the same way. It\r\ndoes not seem to rouse them into a kind of fanatical fervour, such as\r\nblazes up here and there in other parts of France, but it angers them as\r\na disturbance of their settled habits and convictions. 'The Church,'\r\nsaid one of these Calvados farmers to M. de Witt; 'the Church is the key\r\nof our trade. They must not touch it!'\r\n\r\nWhat he meant was, that on Sunday at the village church the farmers,\r\nafter the mass, are in the habit of talking over all their affairs\r\ntogether. It is a kind of social exchange for men whose calling in life\r\nkeeps them far apart during the week.\r\n\r\nIs it to be supplanted for the benefit of the France of the future by\r\ncockpits and cabarets, or courses of lectures delivered in 'scholastic\r\npalaces,' by spectacled and decorated professors, on the 'struggle for\r\nlife,' and the 'survival of the fittest'?\r\n\r\nThe victory of M. Pierre de Witt in July was too complete to leave any\r\npretext for meddling with its results of which the authorities liked to\r\navail themselves. The law, however, gives abundant opportunities for\r\nsuch meddling wherever a plausible pretext can be found. After the votes\r\nof a commune have been verified and counted, two of the assessors start\r\noff at once with all the votes and papers for the chief town of the\r\ncanton. The bureau of this chief town has power to 'verify and, if need\r\nbe, remake the calculations which show the majority. It may modify the\r\ndecisions of the communal bureaux as to the candidate to whom certain\r\nvotes properly belong, may decide what votes are to be treated as\r\nentirely null, or to be counted in estimating the majority without being\r\nheld as given to either candidate. It may also decide what votes belong\r\nto a candidate. It may also take away from the candidates elected, or\r\nclaiming to have been elected, all votes found in the urn or urns in\r\nexcess of the number of electors actually tallied as voting.'\r\n\r\nThe decisions reached by the bureau are next to be collated with the\r\n_procès-verbaux_ of the communal bureaux--after which all the documents\r\nconnected with the election, including the tally-lists of the voters,\r\nare to be sent to the prefect of the department.\r\n\r\nWhen the legislative elections came on in September the authorities of\r\nthe Calvados made desperate efforts to break the solid front of the\r\nMonarchist deputation from this department. In the arrondissement of\r\nPont-l'Evêque, where M. Conrad de Witt stood as the Monarchist\r\ncandidate, the official interference against him was so open that the\r\nPrefect, M. de Brancion, did not hesitate to sign and circulate a letter\r\nintended to affect the elections, though by Article 3 of the law of\r\nNovember 30, 1875, regulating elections, all agents of the Government\r\nare expressly forbidden to distribute ballots, professions of faith, or\r\ncirculars affecting the candidates. M. de Witt had cited to the electors\r\na remarkable declaration made in the Senate by M. Léon Say as to the\r\ninevitable increase of local taxation which must be expected from the\r\ndevelopment and enforcement of the Government policy in regard to\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nM. Léon Say resigned his seat in the Senate last year that he might\r\nenter the Chamber, his friends having convinced themselves, on no very\r\napparent grounds, that his appearance in the Chamber would rally around\r\nhim the support of Conservative men of all shades of opinion, and make\r\nhim master of the situation. He was a candidate in the Hautes Pyrénées.\r\nThe quotation made by M. de Witt from his sensible speech in the Senate\r\nmuch disturbed the Republicans in the Calvados, and some official\r\napplication was evidently made to him on the subject; for, without\r\ndenying that he had said in the Senate what was imputed to him, he seems\r\nto have assured the Republicans of the Calvados that it was absurd to\r\nsuppose he would so speak of the Government policy when he was standing\r\nas a Government candidate for election to the Chamber. This obvious but\r\nquite irrelevant statement was instantly circulated all over the\r\ndepartment by the Prefect himself. As it was very easily disposed of, it\r\ndid no great harm. But it is a curious illustration of the way in which\r\nthese election matters are managed now in France. M. de Witt was\r\ntriumphantly re-elected, receiving 6,972 votes against 5,189 in the\r\narrondissement of Pont-l'Evêque. The Monarchists also carried every\r\nother seat for the Calvados, making seven in all.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, under the _scrutin de liste_, the votes given to M. de Witt\r\nshow a Conservative majority in the Calvados of 13,722 in a total poll\r\nof 89,064. In 1889, taking all the districts together, the Calvados\r\nshowed a Monarchist majority of 19,868 in a total poll of 82,216. This\r\ngives us a falling off in the total poll of 6,848, and an increase in\r\nthe Monarchist majority of 6,497 votes!\r\n\r\nI called M. Conrad de Witt's attention, after the legislative elections\r\nwere over, to an article in an English periodical by a French Protestant\r\nwriter, M. Monod, in which the Monarchist majority of 1889 in the\r\nCalvados was attributed to the bad harvest of pears and apples. The\r\nveteran Protestant President of the Society of Agriculture in the\r\nCalvados smiled in a quiet and significant way, and simply said, 'Ah! I\r\nthink we are more solid than that!'\r\n\r\nSo indeed it would seem!\r\n\r\nThe 'apple-blight' of the Calvados must obviously have extended into the\r\nneighbouring department of the Eure, or at least into the great and busy\r\narrondissement of Bernay, which gave the Monarchist candidate in\r\nSeptember 1889 the tremendous majority of 5,550 votes in a total poll of\r\n12,772. Possibly, too, there may be some occult relation between this\r\nremarkable result and the presence in this arrondissement of one of the\r\nmost distinguished of living Frenchmen, and one of the most outspoken\r\nchampions of the Constitutional Monarchy. An able man with a mind of his\r\nown, and the courage to speak it, is a force in any country at any time.\r\nIn France at this time such a man is a determining force. The obvious\r\nweakness of the Monarchical party in France was touched by the\r\nCommittee of the Catholic Association in their report to which I have\r\nalluded in another chapter. It is the association in the popular mind of\r\nthe monarchical idea with the traditions of Versailles and with the\r\n'pomps and vanities' of what is ridiculously called '_le high-life_' of\r\nmodern Paris. As a matter of fact, all that was silliest and most\r\nscandalous in the Court life of France in the eighteenth century was\r\nreproduced and exaggerated under the Directory. What is there to choose\r\nbetween Louis XV. doffing his hat beside the coach of Madame Du Barry,\r\nand Barras ordering Ouvrard to keep Madame Tallien in diamonds,\r\nopera-boxes, coaches and villas, out of the profits of public loans and\r\ncontracts for the service of the 'Republic one and indivisible'? Formula\r\nfor Formula (to speak after the manner of Mr. Carlyle), is not the\r\nRepublican Formula of the two the more demoralizing, dismal, degraded,\r\nand altogether hopeless? What is called '_le high-life_' of Paris is\r\nneither Royalist nor Republican. It is merely shallow and vulgar, like\r\nthe '_high-life_' of sundry other places ruled by governments of divers\r\nforms. But when young men born to names which in the popular mind\r\nrepresent the history of France show themselves as athletes in a\r\nParisian circus, or appear as grooms on the carriages of _cocottes_ in\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne, their folly naturally damages more or less in the\r\npublic estimation the principles with which the names they bear are\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire the Legitimists, as a body, really played the game of\r\nthe Emperor by holding themselves aloof from public life in all its\r\ndepartments, in accordance with the policy adopted by the Comte de\r\nChambord. The inevitable effect of this policy was to widen the gulf\r\nbetween them and the body of the French people. It tended to bring about\r\nin France results like those aimed at by the National League in\r\nIreland, and to prevent a gradual and wholesome reconciliation between\r\nthe heirs of the class which was exiled and plundered during the\r\nRevolution, and the heirs of the classes which eventually profited by\r\nthe proscriptions and confiscations of that unhappy time. The disastrous\r\nwar of 1870-71 did much to counteract the social mischief thus wrought.\r\nThe French Legitimists came forward in all parts of France to the\r\ndefence of their country. They were brought thus into contact with the\r\npeople and the people with them. They ceased to be a caste and began to\r\nbe citizens. The way was thus prepared, too, for that fusion of the two\r\ngreat Royalist camps, the camp of the Legitimists and the camp of the\r\nOrleanists, which has since taken place. A very intelligent young\r\nofficer of Engineers, himself the heir of an ancient name, told me at\r\nDijon that there are at this time more men of the old families of France\r\non the rolls of the army than ever before since 1789. Instead of\r\nrejoicing in this as the wholesome sign of a growing moral harmony\r\nbetween all classes of Frenchmen, the leaders of the Republican party\r\nhave been incensed by it. Doubtless they regard it as an obstacle to the\r\ndevelopment of their idea of 'moral unity.' Under President Grévy, the\r\nMinister of War actually drove one of the best soldiers in France,\r\nGeneral Schmidt, out of his command at Tours by insisting that he should\r\nforbid his officers to accept invitations from their friends who lived\r\nin the châteaux which are the glory of Touraine, the traditional garden\r\nof France. Imagine a High Church secretary-at-war in England issuing an\r\norder that no officer in a garrison corps should dine with a Catholic or\r\na Dissenter.\r\n\r\nThis was not a freak. It was a policy. It was in perfect keeping with an\r\namazing attack made by the Republican press of Paris not long\r\nafterwards upon the then American Minister in France, Mr. Morton, now\r\nVice-President of the United States, for giving a dinner in honour of\r\nthe Comte de Paris. The Comte de Paris and his brother, the Duc de\r\nChartres, had served with distinction on the staff of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Union armies in America. They were the sons of\r\na French sovereign, with whose government the government of the United\r\nStates had long held close and friendly relations. The Comte de Paris is\r\nthe author of the most careful, thorough, and impartial history yet\r\nwritten of the American Civil War of 1861-65. Yet, for showing his\r\npersonal and official respect for a French prince possessing such claims\r\nupon the respect of Frenchmen as well as of Americans, the diplomatic\r\nrepresentative of the United States was assailed with coarse and vulgar\r\nviolence in the columns of journals assuming to represent the\r\ncivilization of the capital of France!\r\n\r\nSome time after the incident to which I have referred at Tours occurred,\r\nI drove from St.-Malo to La Basse Motte, the charming and picturesque\r\nhouse of General de Charette, in the Ille-et-Vilaine, with the Marquis\r\nde la Roche-Jaquelein. The autumn manoeuvres of the French army were\r\nthen going on. On the way he told me among other things that the\r\nofficers of a cavalry brigade encamped for two or three days in the\r\nneighbourhood of his château had been forbidden by their brigade\r\ncommander to accept a dinner to which he had invited, not only them, but\r\ntheir commander also! The general in command of the cavalry division\r\nfortunately happened to arrive before the day fixed for the dinner, and,\r\nhaving been informed of this state of affairs, quietly authorized the\r\nofficers to attend the dinner, and attended it himself.\r\n\r\nCan anything be more absurd than to attempt to naturalize a Republic in\r\nFrance by identifying Republican institutions with such tyrannical\r\ninterference as this in the private and social relations of French\r\nofficers and citizens?\r\n\r\nThe Third Republic has improved upon Cambon's piratical watchword,\r\n_Guerre aux châteaux; paix aux chaumières_. It makes war socially upon\r\nthe _châteaux_, and it makes war religiously and financially upon the\r\n_chaumières_.\r\n\r\nAll this must bring out into clearer relief before the French people the\r\nunquestionable personal superiority of the Monarchist over the\r\nRepublican leaders and representatives. It is undeniable that an\r\noverwhelming majority of the ablest and most influential men in France,\r\nof all classes and conditions, are to-day in open opposition either to\r\nthe policy or to the constitution of the existing Republic, or to both.\r\nMany--I think most of them--are agreed that the Monarchy must be\r\nrestored if France is to be saved from anarchy and dismemberment. The\r\nrest of them are agreed that the Republic must be so remodelled as to\r\nbecome in fact, if not in name, a monarchy. In this condition of the\r\ncountry, the avowed Monarchists must inevitably draw to themselves the\r\nsupport of all who differ from them, not as to the end, but as to the\r\nmeans only. For the logic of events is steadily strengthening the\r\nverdict uttered by the Duc de Broglie three years ago on the Republican\r\nexperiments, in a speech made by him before the Monarchist Union at\r\nParis on May 29, 1887. 'All these political ghosts must go flitting by,\r\nbut France will endure and remain, forced to pay the price of their\r\nfollies in the form of interest on their loans!'\r\n\r\nThere is no war now between the Château de Broglie and the cottages of\r\nthe Eure; certainly no war between the château and the town of Broglie.\r\nThe town is bright, pretty and prosperous. The park gates open into it\r\nas the park gates of Arundel Castle open into Arundel, but without even\r\nthe semblance of a fortification.\r\n\r\nThe park is very extensive and nobly planned, with a certain stateliness\r\nrather Italian than English. The ground undulates beautifully, and from\r\nits great elevation above the river and the town commands in all\r\ndirections the most charming views. The roads and walks are admirably\r\nlaid out, the trees well grown and lofty. The château itself dates back,\r\nas to its earlier portions, to the Hundred Years' War. It was more than\r\nonce besieged by the English, and some of the ivy-grown walls and towers\r\nwhich overlook the town take you back to Edward III. and the Black\r\nPrince. But the long façade and the main buildings are of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, during which the De Broglies made\r\nso much French history. Within, the spacious saloons, the grand\r\nvestibule and hall, and the delightful library are in perfect keeping\r\nwith the traditions of a family which for generations has given soldiers\r\nand statesmen to the service of a great people. Of course the château\r\nhas been much restored during the present century, but its general\r\ndisposition is what it was in 1789, and, like that of all the French\r\nchâteaux of the eighteenth century, it attests the friendly relations\r\nwhich must have existed before the Revolution between the _château_ and\r\nthe _chaumière_. The English mansions even of the time of Queen Anne are\r\nmore defensible than these _châteaux_. The windows, of the sort which to\r\nthis day are called French windows in England and America, are long\r\nwindows opening like doors. On the ground floor they come down, indeed,\r\nnearly to the level of the lawn. It is perfectly obvious that no thought\r\nof a war of classes can have entered the minds of the architects who\r\nplanned these edifices or of the owners for whom they were planned. Yet\r\nthe problems of government which we imagine to be of our own times had\r\nbeen hotly discussed and were hotly discussing when these edifices were\r\nbuilt. The ideas, not of Villegardelle only, but of Proudhon, were put\r\nforth in germ by De la Jonchère in 1720, in his 'Plan of a New\r\nGovernment.' The Château de Broglie resembles a feudal castle of the\r\nfourteenth or even of the sixteenth century no more than it resembles a\r\nRoman villa of the first century. The magnificent liberality with which\r\nthe Vicomte de Noailles, himself a younger son, gave away all the feudal\r\nrights and privileges of the _noblesse_ on the night of August 4, 1789,\r\nhas always, I am sorry to say, reminded me irresistibly of the patriotic\r\nardour with which Mr. Artemus Ward devoted to the battle-field of\r\nfreedom the remotest cousins of his wife. The evidence is overwhelming\r\nwhich goes to show that these feudal rights and privileges were\r\npractically no more oppressive in the France of 1789 than they were in\r\nthe England of 1830. It is not even clear that the New York anti-renters\r\nof our time had not as good a case for ridding themselves of 'feudal'\r\nrights and privileges by storming the Capitol at Albany as the people of\r\nFrance for ridding themselves of those rights and privileges by storming\r\nthe practically defenceless Bastille. The Bastille interfered no more\r\nwith the liberty of Paris in 1789 than the Tower with the liberty of\r\nLondon. The only people in any particular peril of it were the 'black\r\nsheep' of the _noblesse_, as to whom even Jefferson, in the sketch of a\r\ncharter of French Rights which he drew up in June 1789 and sent to\r\nLafayette and the bookseller St.-Etienne, proposed that their personal\r\nliberty should be subject to a special kind of imprisonment at the\r\nprayer of their relations, or in other words to a regular 'lettre de\r\ncachet.'\r\n\r\nIt is a curious illustration, by the way, of the incapacity of this\r\nNational Assembly that in July 1789 its Committee for framing a\r\nConstitution actually invited a foreign envoy, Jefferson, to take part\r\nwith them in their work. Jefferson had sense enough to decline the\r\ninvitation; but what gleam of sense, political or other, had the\r\nblundering tinkers who gave it? The outcome of their gabble was that mob\r\nviolence destroyed for Paris in the Bastille what London possesses in\r\nthe Tower, an 'architectural document' of the highest authenticity and\r\nimportance. To talk of French feudalism as having been overthrown by\r\nsuch men is absurd. If it had existed when they met, it would have very\r\nsoon sent them about their business. But it did not exist when they met.\r\nThe author of the curious _Précis d'une Histoire Générale de la Vie\r\nPrivée des Français_, published in 1779, treats the whole subject of the\r\nprivate life, homes, manners, and fortunes of the French people\r\nexpressly from the point of view of the great change which had come over\r\nthem, 'since the abolition of feudalism.' The magnanimous achievement of\r\nthe Vicomte de Noailles ought to rank in history with the victory of Don\r\nQuixote over the wine-skins, or with the revolutionary feat of that\r\ndrum-major of the National Guard who slashed with his sabre the corpse\r\nof the unfortunate procureur-syndic Bayeux, lying battered to death in\r\nthe Place des Tribunaux at Caen, on September 6, 1792, and whom the\r\nhonest Normans of the Calvados afterwards kicked out of the city as 'fit\r\nonly for killing dead men.'\r\n\r\nEven in the châteaux of the end of the sixteenth century and the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth we get unanswerable architectural evidence\r\nto show a steady improvement in the social relations of the people with\r\nthe noblesse. The Château d'Eu, for example, in the Seine-Inférieure, in\r\nwhich Louis Philippe entertained Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, and\r\nfrom which the Comte de Paris and his family were so lawlessly expelled\r\nin 1886, was a true fortress in the days when the Norman princes and\r\ntheir armies went and came between England and France, and Tréport saw\r\nmany an armada. But in the fourteenth century we find Raoul de Brienne,\r\nComte d'Eu, confirming to the people of Eu the immunity of their cattle,\r\nbinding himself not 'to make any man work save for good wages and of his\r\nown good will,' not to requisitionise bread or wine but for money paid,\r\nnot to seize any man's horses, and not 'to compel any man to seize and\r\nhale another man to prison except in cases of crime or of invasion.'\r\nWhen the great Duke of Guise rebuilt the château of brick in the\r\nsixteenth century, he put down most of the outer fortifications. Without\r\nthese the château is as much a part of the town of Eu as Buckingham\r\nPalace is of St. James's Park. Catherine of Clèves, the widow of the\r\ngreat Duke of Guise, lived at Eu through her long widowhood in the\r\nfriendliest relations with the good people of the town, while the\r\narchitects were erecting for herself and her murdered husband, 'the\r\nnonpareil of the world,' as she called him (notwithstanding his\r\nadmiration of Mme. de Noirmoutiers), the beautiful monuments which still\r\nadorn the collegiate church. Her daughter, the lovely and lively\r\nPrincesse de Conti, gathered a gay and gallant company of friends about\r\nher, and lived an open-air life of hunting, promenades, and after-dinner\r\n'games of wit,' upon the terraces, as unconcernedly at the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, I was about to say, as such a life could be lived\r\nhere now. But I have to remember that at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and under the illumination of the 'ideas of 1789,' the tomb of\r\nthis Princess in the chapel of Ste-Catherine was broken into, and her\r\nbones flung about on the floor of the mortuary vault, while at the end\r\nof this nineteenth century the legitimate owners of the château which\r\nhas replaced the home of Louise de Lorraine et de Conti have been driven\r\ninto exile for no other crime but that of their birth by a Government\r\nwhich professes to be a Government of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the seventeenth century the Château d'Eu, with the\r\nwhole domain, was sold on behalf of the Duc de Joyeuse et d'Angoulême,\r\nthe ruined heir of the Guises, to 'La Grande Mademoiselle,' the restless\r\nand ambitious daughter of Gaston d'Orléans, brother of Louis XIV. Her\r\nrelations with the people of Eu were more than cordial. History concerns\r\nitself with her as the Bellona of the Fronde, and Court chronicles as\r\nthe wife of that eminent scamp Lauzun. But at Eu she was the Providence\r\nof the poor and the helpless. She founded hospitals and charities of all\r\nsorts. The endowments of most of these were calmly confiscated during\r\nthe Revolution. One hospital, so well endowed that, in spite of the\r\n_assignats_ and of dilapidation, it still had a revenue of 10,000\r\nfrancs, was suppressed in 1810, and the building turned into a barrack,\r\ndespite the remonstrances of a worthy Mayor who still lives in the local\r\ntraditions of Eu. This functionary confronted Napoleon more creditably\r\nthan the Mayor of Folkestone confronted Queen Elizabeth. He received the\r\nEmperor and began his harangue. Presently he stammered, hesitated, and\r\nbroke down. 'What!' said Napoleon, 'Mr. Mayor, a man like you!' 'Ah!\r\nsire!' responded the quick-witted magistrate, 'in the presence of a man\r\nlike your Majesty, I cease to be a man like myself!' Another of the\r\nfoundations of the 'Grande Mademoiselle' still exists in the chief\r\nhospital of Eu, now become the property of the town. The treasurer and\r\nthe physician of this hospital, both of them citizens of the highest\r\ncharacter, who have filled their respective posts for years, are\r\noutspoken Royalists. At the elections of last year they voted as usual\r\nwith their own party. When the elections were over, the Prefect of the\r\nSeine Inférieure requested the Municipal Council of Eu to remove both of\r\nthem. This the Councillors, though Republicans, declined to do.\r\nWhereupon the Prefect removed them by a decree of his own!\r\n\r\nThe Château d'Eu came into the possession of Louis Philippe through his\r\nmother, who was the daughter of the Duc de Penthièvre, and of whose\r\nadmirable character and exemplary patience with her impossible husband\r\nPhilippe Egalité, Gouverneur Morris paints so lively a picture. The Duke\r\nwas so much beloved at Eu, where he habitually lived, that no personal\r\nharm came to him during the first years of the Revolution. He died at\r\nVernon, on the eve of the Terror, and so was spared the pain of\r\nwitnessing the excesses perpetrated at Eu as elsewhere, not only during\r\nthat period but under the Directory. An accomplished resident of Eu\r\nshowed me a decree of the Directory, issued in 1798, and ordering the\r\npeople to meet on January 21: 'the anniversary of the just punishment of\r\nthe last French King, and swear hatred to the Monarchy!' 'What has come\r\nof all that fury and folly?' he said. 'For years since then the people\r\nof Eu have not only \"sworn,\" but shown, genuine affection and respect to\r\ntwo French Kings, Louis XVIII. and Louis Philippe. They didn't care much\r\nabout Charles X., but they were contented under his reign. Eu owes the\r\nrestoration of our noble churches and monuments to these kings, and to\r\ntheir representative the Comte de Paris. One of these kings brought the\r\nsovereign of England and her husband to visit Eu, and made us feel in\r\nour little Norman town that the great days of Normandy were not over. Of\r\nthat fine collection of pictures and of portraits you have been admiring\r\nin the château, a great proportion belonged to the Duc de Penthièvre,\r\nand these, with many other valuable things in the château, were quietly\r\ntaken out and saved when the robberies and blasphemies began here, by\r\nthe Mayor of Eu of that day, who risked his life by doing that good\r\ndeed. When the Comte and the Comtesse de Paris lived here, the park and\r\nthe gardens were the pride and pleasure of the people. Those fountains\r\nare fed by water which the Comte de Paris had brought to Eu for the\r\nservice of the town, and the town is served by it now. Every year Eu was\r\nfilled with people who came and lived here because the Comte and the\r\nComtesse de Paris were here. What good has their exile done to Eu? Here\r\nin Eu we know them. It is not they who are responsible for the local\r\ndebt of Eu, of which we who have to pay it can get no account at all\r\nfrom our precious authorities, except in the form of a demand for more\r\ntaxes!\r\n\r\n'As to the last century, you are quite right. Here, in this part of\r\nNormandy, there were no such grievances then as we have now. There were\r\ntroubles with bad roads and bad agriculture. There were quarrels about\r\nthis right and that privilege. The curés didn't like the grand airs of\r\nthe Church dignitaries. The squires (_hobereaux_) were conceited very\r\noften and ignorant and arrogant. We have not got rid of conceit and\r\nignorance and arrogance, though, by cutting off the heads of a few\r\nsquires a hundred years ago! No! as to Eu, at least, take my word for\r\nit, the happiest day we can see will be the day when we can welcome back\r\nhere the Prince and the Princess who lived so pleasantly and so usefully\r\nwith us and among us, as King and Queen of the French! We are royalists\r\nhere because we know the Comte de Paris, and know that he would do his\r\nduty as the king of a free people, and be something better than the tool\r\nof a swarm of needy and self-seeking adventurers. There is a strong\r\nfeeling here, too, about the intolerant interference of those atheists\r\nat Paris with the rights of parents and with freedom of conscience. Yet\r\nwe are not in the least a priest-ridden people. On the contrary! I can\r\nshow you a commune where the people, vexed with the charges of their\r\ncuré, have deliberately organized a Protestant chapel. They sent to the\r\nConsistory at Paris, and got a minister, and they are doing very well!\r\nWhat we want here is private liberty and public economy. The Republic\r\ngives us neither. The Monarchy, we believe, will give us both!'\r\n\r\nBroglie in the Eure, like La Brède in the Gironde, and Val Richer in the\r\nCalvados, has associations of special interest to Americans. At La Brède\r\nwas born a gallant grandson of Montesquieu, De Sécondat, who earned high\r\npromotion by his valour and his conduct in the American War of\r\nIndependence, side by side with Custine, who took Speier and Metz for\r\nthe Republic, and for his guerdon got the guillotine, and with Vioménil,\r\nwho died bravely defending his King and the law in the palace of the\r\nTuileries. Val Richer was the home of the great French statesman to whom\r\nwe owe the best delineation of Washington we possess, and of whom Mr.\r\nBancroft, the historian of the American Constitution, bears witness\r\nthat, as premier of France, he unreservedly threw open to his researches\r\nall the archives of France in any way bearing upon the history of the\r\nUnited States. 'Nothing was refused me for examination,' he says, 'nor\r\nwas one line of which I desired a copy withheld.'\r\n\r\nBroglie was the birthplace of another French soldier who learned in\r\nAmerica to venerate the character of Washington, and whose life paid the\r\nforfeit under the first despotic French Republic of his loyalty to\r\nliberty and the law. Victor Charles de Broglie was a son of the veteran\r\nMarshal of France, 'cool and capable of anything,' whom Mr. Carlyle\r\nperorates about as the 'war-god.' As the Chief of Staff of Biron, in the\r\narmy of the Rhine, he refused to recognise the usurpers of August 10,\r\n1792, in a letter to his commander which is a model of common sense and\r\nmilitary honour. Upon this letter Carnot, then a legislative\r\nCommissioner, or, in plain English, inspector and informer of the\r\nConvention, on duty with the army, made a report far from creditable\r\neither to his head or his heart. Victor Charles de Broglie was\r\neventually guillotined. Taking farewell of his son, a child nine years\r\nold, he bade him 'never allow himself to believe that it was liberty\r\nwhich had taken his father's life.' The child grew to manhood and to\r\nfame, for ever mindful of this brave injunction. He was the Minister of\r\nLouis Philippe when the claims arising out of the lawless depredations\r\nof the First Republic and the Empire upon American commerce were finally\r\nrecognised and settled by France, and Mr. Bancroft pays him a high and\r\nwell-deserved tribute for the courage with which he insisted on keeping\r\nfaith with the United States 'at the risk of his popularity and of his\r\nplace.' Are we to think it a mere effect of chance, or only a\r\ncoincidence, that the flag of the Constitutional Monarchy, as the sole\r\nalternative of anarchy in France, is supported by the descendants of\r\nMontesquieu, by the heirs of Guizot, and by the son of this Duc de\r\nBroglie to whose courage and integrity France and America were indebted\r\nfor the equitable settlement of an international dispute originally\r\nprovoked by the vulgar folly and impertinence of the first French\r\nRepublic and of the disreputable envoys, Genet and Fauchet, whom it sent\r\none after the other to the United States with orders to appeal from the\r\nGovernment of President Washington to the American people?\r\n\r\nIt was by the 'Military Council' made up of officers trained in the\r\nschool of the great Maréchal de Broglie, and not by the vapouring and\r\nvenal demagogues of the Convention, that France was successfully\r\norganised to resist the Austro-Prussian invasion of 1792; and it was by\r\nthe government of which the present Duc de Broglie was a leading member\r\nunder the Maréchal Duc de Magenta, not by M. Gambetta and M. Jules\r\nFerry, that the Third Republic was so administered when the fortunes of\r\nFrance were at their lowest ebb as to re-establish the finances, restore\r\nthe credit, and renew the military strength of the French nation.\r\n\r\nFor now more than two centuries the name of De Broglie has been made\r\nhistorical in France, not by the favour of princes--for neither in the\r\ncamp nor in the cabinet have the De Broglies ever been courtiers--nor\r\nyet by the applause of the populace, but by the personal ability, the\r\npersonal character, and the public services of the men who have borne\r\nit. If ever a man died for his loyalty to liberty and the law, it was\r\nVictor Charles de Broglie in 1794. His son, the earliest and most\r\nfaithful ally in France of Clarkson and Wilberforce in their long\r\ncrusade against negro slavery, never sought, but accepted his place\r\namong the peers of France after the Restoration. Such was his absolute\r\nindependence that his first act in the Upper Chamber under Louis XVIII.\r\nwas to record his solitary but emphatic protest against the\r\ncondemnation of Marshal Ney. His political career recalls Seneca's\r\ntheory of Ulysses--'nauseator' but fulfilling his Odyssey. He disliked\r\nbut never shirked the responsibilities which were pressed upon him. It\r\nused to be said of M. Thiers that whenever Louis Philippe wished to get\r\nan unpopular measure carried, he contrived to make M. Thiers oppose it\r\nviolently, upset the government upon it, come into power upon his\r\nvictory, and then take the measure up himself and carry it through. The\r\nDuc de Broglie was not a politician of this adroit and acrobatic type.\r\nHis yea was yea and his nay, nay in politics as in private life. He kept\r\naloof from the Second Empire, as his grandfather, Mr. Carlyle's 'War-god\r\nBroglie,' had kept aloof from the first. But he never fell into the\r\nRepublican folly of pretending to regard the Second Empire as a tyranny\r\nimposed upon the people of France against their will. On the contrary,\r\nhe saw things not as he wished them to be, but as they were, and so he\r\nsaid of the Second Empire, 'It is the government which the masses of the\r\npeople in France desire and which the upper classes of France deserve.'\r\n\r\nThe sting of this saying was given to it by the acquiescence of the\r\n'upper classes' in the blow struck by the Second Empire at the rights of\r\nproperty in France when it confiscated in 1852 the estates of the House\r\nof Orléans. This blow was aimed, of course, by Napoleon III. at the\r\nMonarchy of July; just as the blow struck by Napoleon at the Duc\r\nd'Enghien was aimed at the ancient monarchy. But in the one case as in\r\nthe other, the iniquity of the blow affected the fundamental conditions\r\nof social order and peace in France. In the one case as in the other, an\r\nImperial Government, assuming to be a government of law, committed\r\nitself to the most outrageous and despotic practices of the 'Terror' of\r\n1793. In the charter of 1814, Louis XVIII. had abolished confiscation.\r\nIn the Charter of 1830, Louis Philippe had re-affirmed this abolition.\r\nBy the decrees of 1852, seizing the property of the House of Orléans,\r\nNapoleon III. re-established confiscation. In principle these decrees of\r\n1852 were no better than the Jacobin decrees of September 1793, which\r\nfixed the proportion of his own income to be enjoyed by every citizen in\r\nFrance. Réal, the chairman, as we should call him, of the Finance\r\nCommittee of the Convention of 1793, who calmly divided the income of\r\nevery citizen into three categories: 'the necessary' not to exceed, in\r\nthe case of a bachelor, 1,000 francs a year; 'the abundant' not to\r\nexceed 9,000 francs, of which one-half should go to the State; and the\r\n'superfluous,' the whole of which must be paid into the public treasury,\r\nwas a good Jacobin when he made this classification. He lived to become\r\na good Imperialist, and to accept from the Emperor the title of Count,\r\nwith a very large 'superfluous' income, of which he made very good use\r\nfor his own private pleasure and satisfaction. The question as to these\r\ndecrees of 1852 was brought up before the National Assembly on September\r\n15, 1871, by the Comte de Mérode, who, 'in the name of justice and of\r\ncommon honesty,' insisted that the Treasury should cease to receive for\r\npublic uses the income of the private property of the Orléans family,\r\nillegally confiscated by the decrees of January 22, 1852.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Republic at once responded that 'the\r\nresponsibility of this act of spoliation belonged exclusively to its\r\nauthor; and the subject was referred to a Committee. This Committee\r\nreported in 1872 a law founded, in the plain language of the Committee\r\n'upon that principle of common honesty which forbids' man to enrich\r\nhimself at the 'expense of his neighbour.' The Report states that of the\r\n'fifty-one direct descendants then living of King Louis Philippe, not\r\none, to their honour be it said, had addressed any request on the\r\nsubject, either to the Government or to the Assembly.' It states also,\r\nthat having examined the subject carefully, the Committee were\r\nunanimously of the opinion that it was the duty of France 'to restore to\r\nthe owners of this property what belonged to them; no longer to keep in\r\nthe hands of the State what had never belonged to the State.' The\r\nCommittee, considering the frightful disasters brought upon France by\r\nthe war of 1870-71, could not recommend, said the Report, 'that the\r\nTreasury should now undertake absolutely to repair the consequences of\r\nan act repudiated by France. What it recommended was, that the Orléans\r\nfamily should be put into possession of all that was left of its own\r\nproperty, not that it should receive back the equivalent of the sums\r\nalready consumed and dissipated.' At that time the Treasury had\r\nalienated under the decrees of 1852 no less than 70,000,000 francs of\r\nthis lawful property of the Orléans family, unlawfully seized and\r\nconfiscated. The whole property, when seized in 1852, was estimated by\r\nthe Committee of 1872 at 80,000,000 francs. Between 1853 and 1870 the\r\nTreasury had received and spent 35,892,849 francs from sales of this\r\nproperty. It had also received and spent, from the sale of timber cut in\r\nthe forests belonging to the property, 18,601,019 francs. Putting this\r\nlarge sum aside, it is obvious that in the shape of property actually\r\nsold, to the amount in round numbers of 36,000,000 francs, between 1853\r\nand 1870, and of the interest on this amount during the same time, the\r\nImperial Government had really converted to its own uses 70,000,000\r\nfrancs which did not belong to it. Not one penny of these millions of\r\nfrancs was restored to its owners by the decrees of 1872. What the\r\ndecrees of 1872 accomplished, with the approval of such extreme\r\nRepublicans as M. Henri Brisson, was to put a stop to this public\r\nrobbery of private owners. The Orléans estates not yet sold in 1872 were\r\nthen estimated to yield an income of 1,200,000 francs. Before final\r\naction was taken by the Assembly, the Orléans princes voluntarily came\r\nforward and announced that they would accept no 'restitution' at the\r\nexpense of the taxpayers of France of their property sold and alienated\r\nunder the spoliation of 1852; and the text of the law as finally passed\r\nin 1872 expressly ordains that 'conformably to the renunciation offered\r\nbefore the presentation of the bill by the heirs of King Louis Philippe,\r\nand since renewed,' their unsold property, 'real and personal, seized by\r\nthe State and not alienated before this date, be immediately restored to\r\nits owners.' As a matter of fact, therefore, under this law, the heirs\r\nof King Louis Philippe actually made the French Government a present in\r\n1872 of many millions of francs, which belonged to them and did not\r\nbelong to France or to the French Government. By doing this, they\r\nco-operated most creditably with every man of common honesty in the\r\nFrench Assembly in repairing the wrong done to every French citizen by\r\nthe decrees of January 22, 1852, decrees justly described by M. Pascal\r\nDuprat in the Chamber, on November 22, 1872, as 'decrees of flat\r\nspoliation which had violated the sacred right of property, disregarded\r\nthe fundamental rules of law, and profoundly wounded the public\r\nconscience.' However profoundly wounded the public conscience may have\r\nbeen by these decrees in 1852, the scornful words of the Duc de Broglie\r\nattest that it suffered in silence and for twenty years made no\r\nadequate outward sign!\r\n\r\nThis cool and caustic statesman was born and brought up in the Catholic\r\nChurch. He married a Protestant lady, one of the most charming and\r\nbrilliant women of her time, the daughter of Madame de Staël, and he was\r\nthe intimate friend and associate throughout his public life of M.\r\nGuizot. His son, the present duke, grew up in an atmosphere of practical\r\nreligious liberality. It was the law of 1875 restricting the State\r\nmonopoly of the higher branches of public education in France which\r\nconcentrated against the present duke, under the Maréchal Duc de\r\nMagenta, the whole strength of the anti-religious elements in France. It\r\nwas not to prevent the restoration of the monarchy by men like the Duc\r\nde Magenta and the Duc de Broglie, whom he well knew to be incapable of\r\nconspiring for any object whatever, that M. Gambetta uttered his\r\nwar-cry: '_Le cléricalisme c'est l'ennemi!_' It was to rally behind\r\nhimself and his own associates in the Republican party the great army of\r\nthe Socialistic Radicals in France. It was to make the Conservative\r\nRepublic of the Duc de Magenta and the Duc de Broglie impossible, that\r\nthe Parliamentary conspirators of 1877 conceived and carried out, under\r\ncover of this war-cry, their scheme for suppressing the Executive in\r\nFrance. They have, as I believe, succeeded. They have made the\r\nConservative Republic impossible. What is the result? The result is that\r\nno alternative of anarchy is left to sensible and moderate men in France\r\nbut the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThis has been growing more and more apparent ever since 1885. In that\r\nyear the Legislative elections were made under the _scrutin de liste_;\r\nand when the Government rallied after the shock of the first\r\nConservative attack, almost all the seats left in peril by that attack\r\nwere 'saved' at the supplementary election by surrendering them to\r\nRadical candidates. In 1889, under the fear of Boulanger, the _scrutin\r\nde liste_ was suddenly abandoned for the _scrutin d'arrondissement_, and\r\nthe same thing happened again.\r\n\r\nAt the first election, on September 22, 384 candidates of all parties\r\nwere chosen in the 83 departments of France. Of these, 164 were\r\nGovernment Republicans and 44 Radicals. At the second election, on\r\nOctober 8, the remaining 177 seats were filled. Of these, 66 were\r\ncarried by the Government Republicans, and no fewer than 57 surrendered\r\nto the Radicals. In other words, at the first election the Radicals\r\nsecured just about a quarter of the 208 seats carried by the\r\nRepublicans. At the second election they secured very nearly one half of\r\nthe 123 seats carried by the Republicans. So that the Radicals finally\r\nmuster 101 out of the 331 Republican home members of the present\r\nChamber, and are, therefore, practically masters of the situation so far\r\nas the Republic is concerned. They made this perfectly clear as soon as\r\nthe Chamber met by insisting upon and securing the election of M.\r\nFloquet, a Radical of the advanced left wing, as President of the\r\nChamber. Were the Radicals to withdraw their support from the Government\r\non any issue, it would be left with 254 members to face a combined\r\nopposition vote of 229 members, which might at any moment be converted\r\ninto a hostile majority by the action of less than a third of the\r\nRadicals. When we remember that these 101 Radicals are represented in\r\nthe Chair of the Chamber by a leader who was locked up for a year in\r\n1871 for his participation in the revolt of the Commune, and who voted\r\nin 1876 for the full pardon of the convicts of the Commune, it will be\r\nobvious, I think, that the Republicans 'have committed suicide to save\r\nthemselves from slaughter.'\r\n\r\nM. Floquet, imprisoned in 1871 for complicity with the Commune, was made\r\nPrefect of the Seine in 1882 by the men who have since made M. Carnot\r\nPresident of the Republic. As President of the Chamber, M. Floquet,\r\nunder the existing régime in France, is now the superior of M. Carnot.\r\nCan there be any mistake as to the meaning of this? In 1882, as Prefect\r\nof the Seine, M. Floquet maintained the closest relations with the\r\nMunicipal Council of Paris. M. Ferry's bill making primary education\r\nobligatory, and 'laicizing' that education, finally became law on July\r\n26, 1881. The war against God in the schools began at once vigorously,\r\nand nowhere more vigorously than in Paris. M. Paul Bert had insisted, in\r\nhis Report of 1879, upon the importance of protecting teachers who were\r\nscientific and philosophical Atheists against the pangs their\r\nconsciences would suffer were they obliged to read or to hear recited\r\npassages from 'what is called Sacred History, that is to say, a mixture\r\nof positive history, with legends which have no value except in the eyes\r\nof believers.' In this spirit of the peddler who tried to 'scrub out the\r\nblood-stains' at Holyrood the law of 1881 was conceived. How it was\r\nexecuted we learn from M. Zévort, a distinguished inspector of the\r\nAcademy of Paris, and by no means a Catholic. In some places the\r\nauthorities ordered the words 'Love God, respect your parents,' to be\r\neffaced from the school-house walls. In others, children were compelled\r\nto give up the Catechisms which they had brought with them to school,\r\nintending to go on after school hours to the parish church. In this same\r\nyear M. Fournier stated in the Senate that persons appointed by the\r\nMinister of Public Instruction to distribute prizes in the schools had\r\nmade speeches to the children in which they spoke of all religion as\r\nmere superstition. He cited one such orator as contrasting 'scientific\r\neducation, the only true education, which gives man the certainty of his\r\nown value and urges him onward to progress and to the Light,' with\r\n'religious education which fatally plunges him into a murky night, and\r\nan abyss of deadly superstitions.' Another luminary of the State\r\nexclaimed in a burst of eloquence, 'Young citizenesses and young\r\ncitizens! We have been accused of banishing God from the schools! It is\r\nan error! Nothing can be driven out which does not exist. Now God does\r\nnot exist. What we have suppressed is only a set of emblems!'\r\n\r\nThese emblems were the religious inscriptions, and the crucifixes, taken\r\nout of the school-houses. Of these emblems the Prefect of the Seine, in\r\n1882, carelessly observed in the course of an enquiry before the Senate,\r\nthat the removal of them was 'only a question of school furniture!' And\r\nthe Municipal Council of Paris, with which M. Floquet in 1882 so\r\ncordially co-operated, formally adopted resolutions calling for the\r\ncomplete suppression in all the primary schools 'of all theological\r\ninstruction whatsoever.' 'No one,' said one councillor, M. Cattiaux,\r\nwith much solemnity, 'can prove the existence of God, and our teachers\r\nmust not be compelled to affirm the existence of an imaginary being.'\r\n\r\nWith M. Floquet as President of the Chamber, M. Carnot and his Ministers\r\nare at the mercy not of the Radicals only, but of the Radical allies of\r\nthe Commune. The French Monarchists to-day are fighting out the battle\r\nof religion and of civilization for every country in Christendom.\r\n\r\nThough the Calvados was the chosen home of M. Guizot, it was not his\r\nbirthplace. Like M. Thiers, whom he so little resembled in other\r\nparticulars, M. Guizot was a son of the South. He was born at Nîmes, in\r\nthe Gard, a city rather Republican than Royalist by its traditions, even\r\nunder the old Monarchy. His father was an advocate, and by the charter\r\nof Nîmes, which organized in 1476 the 'consular' government of the city,\r\nit was provided that the first consul of Nîmes should always be taken\r\nfrom among 'the advocates graduated and versed in the law,' the second\r\nconsulate only being left open to 'citizens, merchants, and graduated\r\nphysicians.'\r\n\r\nAs the fifteenth century is commonly admitted to have been a 'feudal'\r\ncentury, this provision attests the power of the robe as against the\r\nsword in a very interesting way, and at an interesting point in French\r\nhistory. The local nobility felt the slight put upon them very strongly,\r\nand made great efforts to have the system changed. These efforts were\r\nnot successful till the end of the sixteenth century. In 1588 the Duc de\r\nMontmorency, Governor of Languedoc, issued a decree convoking the\r\nCouncil-General to consider the subject, and this assembly, after a\r\nstormy session, decided that 'the noblemen and gentlemen of the province\r\nshould hold the first consulate alternately with the advocates.' The\r\nfirst nobleman of Languedoc who profited by this decision was Louis de\r\nMontcalm, an ancestor of the illustrious defender of Quebec. He became\r\nfirst consul of Nîmes in 1589, the year after the defeat of the great\r\nSpanish Armada against England. He was a Huguenot, and Nîmes in the days\r\nof the great Religious Wars had become a Protestant stronghold after its\r\ncapture by the Huguenots on November 15, 1569. The Huguenot de Calvière,\r\nBaron de St.-Cosme, who took a leading part in that military adventure,\r\nwas made Governor of Nîmes and a gentleman of the King's bedchamber by\r\nHenry of Navarre.\r\n\r\nAs a Protestant and as an advocate, the father of M. Guizot naturally\r\ninclined to the Republican theory of Government in 1789. He very soon\r\nand as naturally opened his eyes to the abominations of the Republican\r\npractice, and in due course came to the guillotine under the Terror. To\r\nthe day of her death his widow wore the deepest mourning for him, and\r\nhis son, like the son of the murdered Victor Charles de Broglie,\r\nhonoured his memory by an inflexible loyalty to the principles of\r\njustice and of liberty for which his father had died.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised, therefore, to find M. Guillaume Guizot, the\r\nProtestant son of the great Protestant statesman, at his pleasant rural\r\nhome near Uzès as earnest and active in the summer of 1889 in organizing\r\nthe monarchical party for the Legislative elections, as the staunchest\r\nCatholics of the Morbihan or of Champagne. Uzès, which gives a ducal\r\ntitle to the family of Crussol, is a picturesque and interesting town,\r\nand its electoral district made a gallant stand for liberty and order in\r\nthe elections. It gave nearly 9,000 Monarchist against about 11,000\r\nRepublican votes, and the returns of the whole Department of the Gard,\r\nwhen compared with those of 1885, show a marked change to the\r\ndisadvantage of the powers that be. In the first place the total of the\r\nvotes polled fell off more than 10 per cent. in 1889 from the total in\r\n1885. In 1885, 110,786 were polled. In 1889, 97,828. In the next place\r\nthe Republican votes in the whole department fell off in 1889 nearly 20\r\nper cent. from the Republican total in 1885, or from 58,328 to 46,323.\r\nIn the third place the Republican majority over the Monarchists fell off\r\nmore than 60 per cent. from the majority in 1885, or from 5,910 to\r\n2,062. In the fourth place the Monarchists in the first district of\r\nNîmes had a majority of more than 1,500 votes over the Government\r\nRepublicans. And in the fifth place the Republicans, who in 1885 secured\r\nthe whole delegation of six members from the Gard, in 1889 lost the seat\r\nfor the second district of Alais, which the Monarchists carried by a\r\nmajority of 1,305 votes over the combined strength of the Government\r\nRepublicans and the Boulangist Revisionists. This district is a coal and\r\niron-mining as well as a silk-growing district. It is fall of workmen,\r\nand it has been a point of attack for the Socialist and subversive\r\nleaders in France for many years past. All the traditions of Alais\r\nitself are strongly Protestant. The fortifications of the town were\r\ndestroyed by Louis XIV. at the end of the seventeenth century, and at no\r\ngreat distance is the Tour du Bellot, the lonely spot which witnessed\r\none of the most desperate conflicts between Cavalier and the royal\r\ntroops. The slaughter of the Camisards, shut up in their burning tower,\r\nis a tale of horror still in the countryside. At Nîmes the memories of\r\nthe long and merciless strife between the Catholics and the Protestants\r\nof Southern France are fresher still and more intense. M. Guillaume\r\nGuizot well remembers the bitterness of the passions roused at Nîmes by\r\nthe local struggles between the 'two Religions' which followed the\r\nRestoration. His father was one day reasoning on the subject with a\r\nProtestant citizen of Nîmes, who suddenly pointed to a man passing on\r\nthe other side of the street, and said: 'That man had a hand in the\r\nkilling of my father here in the streets of Nîmes. How can you ask me to\r\nforget that?'\r\n\r\nThe Republicans of the Third Republic, bent on coercing France into a\r\n'moral unity' of Atheism, are fast making both Catholics and Protestants\r\nforget such things in the imminence of a new and common peril to the\r\nliberties and the rights of both. The two daughters of M. Guizot, as is\r\nwell known, married two brothers, the heirs and representatives of the\r\ngreat Protestant and Republican family of De Witt. One of these\r\nbrothers, M. Conrad de Witt, just re-elected a deputy for the Calvados,\r\nwas my host at Val Richer. The other, M. Cornelis de Witt, the namesake\r\nof the statesman for whom his illustrious brother the Grand Pensionary\r\nof Holland sacrificed his own life in a vain effort to save him from the\r\nbrutal fury of an ignorant and frantic multitude at the Hague, has just\r\nbeen taken, in the full force of his energies and his great ability,\r\nfrom the love of his friends and from the cause of liberty in France. As\r\na deputy and a member of the Government he took an active part in the\r\nre-establishment of the finances and the public organisation of France\r\nafter the disasters of 1870-71. As a director of the great mines at\r\nAuzin, and as Vice-President of the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean\r\nRailway Company, he was in close and constant touch with the working\r\nclasses of France and with the great material interests of a country\r\nwhich he loved as his ancestors loved Holland. This is not the place in\r\nwhich to speak of the personal gifts and graces which will keep the name\r\nof M. Cornelis de Witt green in the memory of all who knew him. But of\r\nhis great qualities as a citizen, and of the judgment absolutely\r\nunwarped by passion or by prejudice which gave weight to all his\r\npolitical convictions, it is the place to speak. After a fair and\r\nserious experiment, in which he took his part loyally, at founding in\r\nFrance the 'Conservative Republic' of M. Thiers, he thought that outlook\r\nfor the future completely and hopelessly closed; and as it was neither\r\nin the traditions of Netherlandish liberty nor in his own virile and\r\ncourageous temper to acquiesce in the domination of a political\r\noligarchy ready, like Carrier and the Jacobins of 1792, to 'make France\r\none vast cemetery rather than not regenerate it after their own minds!'\r\nM. Cornelis de Witt looked about him calmly for a way of escape.\r\n\r\nThis way he found where the sagacious Netherlanders of the seventeenth\r\ncentury found it after the hard-won liberties of Holland had been\r\nprostrated by the mad revolt of a misled multitude against the\r\nGovernment of the Grand Pensionary, who had held his own against\r\nCromwell and against Louis XIV., made Holland the first naval power of\r\nthe world, and scared London with the thunder of the Dutch cannon in the\r\nThames. Nothing but the restoration of the hereditary principle in the\r\nperson of William of Orange saved Amsterdam and Rotterdam from falling\r\nat the end of the seventeenth century, as they fell at the end of the\r\neighteenth, under the dominion of an invader. When the hereditary\r\nprinciple was again abandoned after the death of William of Orange, the\r\ndomestic peace as well as the national prestige of Holland vanished with\r\nit, and though the Dutch people in the middle of the eighteenth century\r\ninsisted upon seeing it for a time restored, the power of the Dutch\r\nExecutive towards the end of the century was so much hampered and\r\nweakened by the local jealousies of the provinces, that in the\r\nConvention which framed the Constitution of the United States, Mr.\r\nButler, who had travelled much in the Low Countries, successfully\r\nenforced the necessity of making the American Executive monarchical by a\r\nvivid description of the evils inflicted upon Holland by her departures\r\nfrom that principle. We took warning as to the perils of the Union from\r\nthe example of the Low Countries, and as to the importance of the\r\nExecutive from the example of Great Britain. There were many Americans\r\nindeed in 1788, men of worth and of weight both in private and in public\r\naffairs, who rather than accept Edmund Randolph's plan of confiding the\r\nExecutive authority to a triumvirate, would have given their adhesion to\r\nthe seriously mooted project of making the American Executive absolutely\r\nhereditary, and inviting the Prince-Bishop of Osnaburg to accept the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe convictions of M. Cornelis de Witt are represented now with equal\r\nenergy and determination in Normandy by his brother, M. Conrad de Witt,\r\nand by his son, M. Pierre de Witt, just elected a Councillor-General of\r\nthe Calvados, and in Languedoc by his brother-in-law, M. Guillaume\r\nGuizot, and by his son, M. Cornelis Henri de Witt.\r\n\r\nThe home of M. Cornelis Henri de Witt, near Tonneins, in the\r\nLot-et-Garonne, stands in the heart of a land of fruits and vines. From\r\nthe terrace of his château of Peyreguilhot, the eye ranges over a fine\r\nexpanse of the valley of the Garonne, which at no great distance from\r\nTonneins mingles with the Lot beneath the promontory of Nicole. The\r\nlandscape is rich in colour. Great fields of tobacco alternate with\r\nextensive orchards. It is a land to be seen in the season of blossoms.\r\nThe world-famed prunes of Bordeaux come mainly from about Agen, and the\r\npleasant little commune of Nicole probably draws a much larger tribute\r\nto-day from London, in exchange for its precocious apricots, than it\r\never paid to London when the Plantagenet eaglets were rending the eagle\r\nof Winchester. The old traditions of Guienne seem to be much less vivid\r\nthan those of Normandy or Brittany. I have heard Bretons speak of the\r\nDuchess Anne as the Scotch Jacobites still speak of the Stuarts. But\r\nthough Coeur de Lion is still a popular hero in the land of Bertrand\r\nde Born, there is nothing there like the Provençal feeling in Provence.\r\nAt St. Rémy, the beautiful birthplace of Nostradamus, a lively waiter in\r\nthe excellent hotel of the 'Cheval Blanc,' taking me for a Frenchman of\r\nthe north, contrived very skilfully to let me know that the Provençals\r\ndo not hold themselves responsible for the failure of Northern France to\r\nrepulse the Germans. 'If the Comte de Paris had not got the better long\r\nago of the Comte de Provence,' he informed me, 'France would have been\r\nProvençal and not Provence French, and then things would have gone\r\ndifferently altogether.' But all Languedoc is as proud of its language\r\nas Wales. A youth who took me at Agen to see the shop and house of the\r\n'barber-bard' was clearly of the opinion that the poetry of Lamartine\r\nand Victor Hugo would have been as fine as the poetry of Jasmin had they\r\nbeen so fortunate as to use his mother-tongue. 'The French language was\r\na kind of Gallic patois mixed with German, while the true langue d'Oc,\r\nas I must know, was the language of the Romans.' This same philologist\r\ntook me also to the little valley of 'Verona,' where he showed me not\r\nonly a small vineyard, the property of Jasmin, but the house, the\r\nfountain, and the huge stone chair of Scaliger, 'a great philosopher\r\ndescended from Julius Cæsar.' Joseph Scaliger, I believe, was really\r\nborn in this house, which was given to his illustrious father by the\r\nBishop of Agen; and Joseph with his own eyes saw some three hundred\r\nHuguenots burnt alive in Agen on the great Place du Gravier, where now\r\nthe annual fairs of Agen are held under the stately elms.\r\n\r\nThe lands of the Lot-et-Garonne are full of memories of the English\r\nwars, of the Albigensian crusade, of the long duel between the Church\r\nand the Calvinists. Tonneins, once a curious 'double city' of the\r\nmiddle ages, was destroyed in the seventeenth century by Louis XIII.\r\nfor its fidelity to the Huguenot cause. Nérac, where Jeanne d'Albret and\r\nthe two Margots held their gay and gallant courts, and Henry of Navarre\r\nestablished his headquarters during 'the Lovers' War,' suffered as\r\nseverely for the like cause under Louis XIV. The revocation of the Edict\r\nof Nantes sent its most industrious inhabitants into exile, not a few of\r\nthem crossing the Atlantic to join the Huguenot colonies in New York and\r\nin the Carolinas. 'But the Revolution of 1789 did Nérac more harm,' said\r\nan intelligent tradesman of the picturesque little city to me, 'than the\r\nRevocation. The Revocation drove away many honest people from Nérac, but\r\nthe Revolution brought here a great many rogues.' The country around\r\nNérac is extremely fertile, and great prizes were to be picked up here\r\nduring the decade of proscription and confiscation. The Garenne, one of\r\nthe loveliest public parks in France, in which a beautiful fountain\r\nsparkles and murmurs beneath two lofty elms planted by Henry of Navarre\r\nand Marguerite de Valois, was actually bought during the First Consulate\r\nby the city for a little over five thousand francs, or two hundred\r\npounds sterling. The war of 1791 against 'privileges' soon became in\r\nNérac, as elsewhere in France, a war against property. The immediate\r\neffect of this was not, what we are constantly told it was, to increase\r\nthe wealth of France by 'redistributing' it amongst the active and\r\nindustrious classes. It was, on the contrary, to diminish the wealth of\r\nFrance by lowering the real value of property. This is clearly shown by\r\nthe extraordinary pains which Napoleon took to enforce respect for the\r\nrights of property as soon as he grasped the supreme power in the State.\r\nBut one comes everywhere upon striking local proofs of it. At Najac in\r\nthe Department of the Aveyron, for example, the obliging hotel-keeper\r\nwill give you the key of one of the most magnificent ruined castles in\r\nSouthern France, which, with its grand donjon, and all the massive\r\ncircle of its walls and ramparts, was seized and sold, during the\r\nTerror, for _twelve francs_. The purchaser made a deal of money by\r\nconverting the castle into a quarry, and when law and order were\r\nrestored, he gladly parted with his very dubious title for the highly\r\nrespectable advance on his investment of 1,500 francs. As a piece of\r\nsuccessful 'gerrymandering' the Republican treatment of this Department\r\nof the Aveyron, by the way, in the elections of 1889, is worth\r\nmentioning. In 1885, under the _scrutin de liste_, the Aveyron was\r\nentitled to six deputies. It elected a solid Conservative\r\nrepresentation. In 1889, under the _scrutin d'arrondissement_, the\r\nGovernment carved out seven seats for the Aveyron, and the electoral\r\ndistricts were so ingeniously framed as to secure two out of these seven\r\nseats for the Republicans--though the total of the votes cast in the\r\ndepartment showed a clear majority for the Monarchists of 5,582!\r\n\r\nWe had a banquet of Mayors while I was at Peyreguilhot; not such a\r\nBelshazzar's feast as M. Constans gave at Paris to the thirteen\r\nthousand, but a simple and interesting gathering of about a dozen\r\nintelligent and active elective magistrates. Under a recent law all\r\nMayors, except in Paris, are now chosen by the Councils, but the\r\nGovernment can revoke their commissions. Our guests at Peyreguilhot were\r\nall shrewd, quiet, active men of the country. 'We shall be beaten in\r\nSeptember,' said one of them to me, 'because the Government employs men\r\nenough to beat us. Moreover, our farmers say, \"Why vote at all, for the\r\nMayors and the Prefect throw our votes out and cheat us?\" Then, too, we\r\nmust have a man to vote for before we can make them move. They will not\r\nvote for the Monarchy as a principle. But give them a man who touches\r\ntheir imaginations and they will make him a Monarch.' They voted for\r\nLouis Napoleon as soon as they saw him take the Assembly resolutely by\r\nthe throat. They would have voted, overwhelmingly, for Boulanger on\r\nSeptember 22 had he suddenly reappeared in Paris, demanding a revision\r\nof the verdict of the High Court.\r\n\r\nThis is true, I think, not of the Lot-et-Garonne alone, but of all\r\nFrance. It has been signally illustrated since the elections of 1889 by\r\nwhat Stendhal would have called the rapid 'crystallization' of public\r\nsympathy around the young Duc d'Orléans when he suddenly appeared in\r\nParis. The Government was completely bewildered and demoralized by this\r\n'bolt out of the blue.' Instead of quietly reconducting the prince to\r\nthe frontier with a reprimand for his inconsiderate and unconventional\r\npatriotism, it stupidly locked him up in a prison haunted by legends\r\ndisgraceful to the Republic, proceeded against him with clumsy\r\nvehemence, gave him time to show himself to the French people, in the\r\nwords of the Duc d'Aumale, as a '_pur sang_,' a straightforward, dashing\r\nyoung French prince demanding the right of performing his military duty\r\nto the State, had him condemned, tardily resolved to pardon him, and\r\nwound up finally by sending him to Clairvaux to placate the criminal\r\nbullies of the Commune!\r\n\r\nWhat has been the result? It cannot be more exactly stated than in the\r\nwords of the official organ of the Russian Empire at Brussels, _Le\r\nNord_, a journal certainly not predisposed in favour of the House of\r\nOrléans by the success of the Orléanist Prince Ferdinand in Bulgaria.\r\n'The appearance of this young exile,' said _Le Nord_, 'on the soil of\r\nFrance, not as a pretender or with political ideas, but simply as a\r\nFrenchman coming to establish his moral rights as a citizen by claiming\r\nto be allowed to perform his civic duties, and this with a rare\r\ncombination of youthful dash, irreproachable modesty, and skilful\r\nself-possession was admirably fitted to awaken, and it has awakened, the\r\nsympathy of all who are politically disinterested.'\r\n\r\nThis is strong language coming from the only great power in the world to\r\nwhich France can look as a possible ally in the present condition of\r\nEurope. It was emphasised by the ablest and most active of the French\r\nImperialists, M. Paul de Cassagnac. 'To keep this young prince in prison\r\nis impossible. To do so would make him King of France within three\r\nyears. To let him go, after keeping him for a week, is no longer a\r\ngenerous and magnanimous act. It is simply obeying the vigorous kick\r\nadministered by the masters of the Government, the French people, who\r\nhave been saying of the Orléans princes, \"they won't move,\" and who now\r\nsee a young Duc d'Orléans move forward with a gay virility which has a\r\nflavour of Henri IV.! If the young Duc d'Orléans is as intelligent as I\r\nam told, and believe that he is, he wouldn't change places with Carnot\r\nto-day!'\r\n\r\nEvery 'ministerial crisis' which weakens the Government will strengthen\r\nthe prestige acquired for the Monarchy by the young duke. He has won the\r\nwomen by his pluck, the fathers of families by his deference to the\r\nComte de Paris, the Catholics by asking for a chaplain at Clairvaux, and\r\nthe _chauvins_ by his military ardour.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine showed me in Paris ten days after the arrest of the\r\nprince a letter from Normandy, in which the writer said, 'Millions of\r\nfrancs would not have done what has been done by this simple act to\r\nrevive and invigorate the monarchical party throughout this whole\r\nregion.... _Le petit conscrit_ will be the prince of the people from\r\nthis day forth. The gray-beards among the peasants shake their heads and\r\nsay, \"All the same, it is not such a nice thing, this conscription, and\r\nsince he was out of it why run into it?\" But the women reply, \"Since our\r\nlads have to go in, it is plucky of the Comte de Paris to put his son in\r\ntoo!\"'\r\n\r\nTo make a handsome young prince a martyr of patriotism in the eyes of\r\nthe women and the conscripts of France, is a highly original way of\r\nblocking the progress of his father to the throne!\r\n\r\nThe Mayors at Peyreguilhot were all of one mind as to the fiscal conduct\r\nof the Republican Government. It was 'making life impossible for the\r\nagriculturists of all categories. The tax on the revenue of the land in\r\nthe Lot-et-Garonne was levied still on a _cadastre_ drawn up in 1837; so\r\nthat lands now lying idle were taxed as they were taxed fifty years ago\r\nwhen covered with vines. Thanks to this system, forty-two departments in\r\nFrance pay more than their due proportion of this tax, and the others\r\nless than their due proportion. The Aude, which is a very rich\r\ndepartment, producing, if you take good and bad years together, more\r\nthan 20,000,000 francs of wine alone every year, pays a million of\r\nfrancs less, and the Lot-et-Garonne nearly a quarter of a million more,\r\nthan its due share of this tax.'\r\n\r\nM. de Witt confirmed these statements. The inequalities in national\r\ntaxation, he tells me, are one of the crying grievances of France under\r\nthe existing régime. Corsica, for example, pays only ninety-five\r\ncentimes _per cent._ of revenue tax, while the Corrèze pays seven francs\r\nninety cents, and there is one commune in the Gironde which actually\r\npays ninety francs per cent. Besides the people pay the door and window\r\ntax, the furniture tax, the _prestations en nature_, the permanent\r\npersonal tax, and the octrois and the _centimes additionnels_ levied for\r\neducational and other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe taxes levied as _centimes additionnels_ for the Departments of\r\nFrance increased from 1878 to 1886 by 24,692,266 francs, and the taxes\r\nlevied as _centimes additionnels_ for the Communes (exclusive of Paris)\r\nby 34,246,647 francs, while from 1878 to 1885 the total of the debts of\r\nthe Communes increased at the rate of 55,000,000 francs a year! The\r\ndepartmental loans during the same period increased no less than 95 per\r\ncent., or from 128,417,499 francs in 1876 to 249,188,700 francs in 1886.\r\n\r\nSince the new Chamber met the air has been full of rumours of new loans,\r\nand of modifications of taxation. These modifications may ease the\r\npressure on one point, but only by increasing it upon another point. No\r\nfinancier in France pretends to put the annual burden borne by the\r\nFrench people at much less than double the annual taxation of Great\r\nBritain. M. Méline, a Republican of the Republicans, admitted before the\r\nChamber of Deputies on February 10, 1885, that the people of France were\r\nmore heavily taxed at that time 'than those of any other country in the\r\nworld.' He put the taxation of England at 57 francs a head, of the\r\nUnited States at 59 francs a head, of Germany at 44 francs a head, and\r\nof France at 104 francs a head.\r\n\r\nAnd to-day the French people are more heavily taxed than they were in\r\n1885. The mere general expenses of collecting the revenue of France are\r\nset down in the Budget for 1890 at 107,343,926 francs, or, in round\r\nnumbers, 4,293,745_l._; divided as follows. Direct and assimilated land\r\ntaxes, 19,838,175 francs; registrations, domains, and stamps,\r\n19,143,950; customs, 31,077,301; indirect taxes, 37,284,500 francs.\r\n\r\nM. de Witt represents the Canton of Castêl Moron in the Council-General\r\nof the Lot-et-Garonne, and he is Mayor of the Commune of Laparade. At\r\nthe Legislative elections of last year, he contested the representation\r\nof the Nérac district with M. Fallières, the Minister of Public\r\nInstruction, and was defeated, receiving 6,484 votes against 8,967 given\r\nto the Minister. M. Fallières 'on the stump,' speaking with the\r\nauthority of a Minister of 'Public Instruction,' actually assured the\r\nelectors that to vote for M. de Witt was to vote to 're-establish\r\nseignorial rights, and to bring on a German or _Cossack_ invasion!' One\r\nresult of this was, that M. de Witt was burned in effigy near Tonneins\r\nafter the election!\r\n\r\nAfter the election of M. de Witt as Mayor of Laparade, he was accused\r\nbefore the tribunal at Marmande of 'corrupting' the electors of the\r\ncommune. The accusation rested on 'conversations,' but the tribunal\r\nsentenced M. de Witt to a fine of a thousand francs, and several of his\r\nelectors to smaller fines. They all appealed to the Court at Agen, where\r\nthe case was pleaded by M. Piou, deputy for the Haute Garonne and one of\r\nthe ablest barristers in Southern France.\r\n\r\nIt throws an interesting light on the present condition of political\r\nlife in France, that M. de Witt, though the sentence of the tribunal at\r\nMarmande was not sustained, had eventually to pay a fine of 500 francs\r\non the ground that he had been guilty of 'excessive charity' to an old\r\nman of 80, named Sauvean, who had long been a pensioner of his family!\r\nThe wonder is that his commission as Mayor by the choice of his\r\nfellow-citizens was not revoked by the Ministry at Paris. Under the\r\nThird Republic this is no uncommon thing.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1889, M. Duboscq, Mayor of the commune of Labrit in\r\nthe Landes, one of the many out-of-the way and charming places which in\r\nthat part of France are associated with the memory of Henri IV., gave a\r\ndinner to M. Lambert de Ste.-Croix, the distinguished Monarchist leader,\r\nwho died not long ago. For this offence--M. Lambert de Ste.-Croix having\r\njust then exasperated the Republicans beyond measure by a vigorous\r\nspeech made at Dax on the Adour--M. Duboscq was actually suspended from\r\nhis office by order of M. Floquet, now the President of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies! In reply to a question on the subject put by a deputy, M.\r\nLamarzelle, M. Floquet calmly replied that lie had suspended M. Duboscq\r\nbecause, 'being a functionary of the Government, he had departed from\r\nthe reserve proper in his position by inviting an opponent of the\r\nGovernment to dinner!' The Mayors of these communes, be it observed, are\r\nelected by the people, not appointed by the Government! So that under\r\nthe practice of the French Republic, as represented by the present\r\nPresident of the Chamber, a Radical Mayor of Newcastle who should ask\r\nMr. Gladstone to dinner ought to be 'suspended' at once by Lord\r\nSalisbury! This is municipal liberty in France under the Third Republic.\r\n\r\nAs the Legislative elections are conducted under the supervision of the\r\nMayors, the object of such performances as these is obvious enough. At\r\nthe same time with M. Duboscq, M. Davezac de Moran, Mayor of Siest near\r\nDax, was also suspended by M. Floquet for the offence of allowing the\r\nmeeting of the Monarchical Committees, at which M. Lambert de Ste.-Croix\r\nmade his speech, to be held in his own house at Dax! 'If you think,'\r\nsaid M. Lamarzelle to the Minister, 'to frighten us with all this, you\r\nare mistaken. At your age Robespierre had got himself guillotined!'\r\nDuring the Legislative elections of 1889 'the school-teachers, the\r\npostmen, the gendarmes, the highway supervisors and the labourers, were\r\nordered to vote against the Monarchist candidates.' M. Delafosse,\r\nelected in the Calvados, publicly stated this in the _Matin_, and\r\nwithout contradiction. During the same elections the curés were\r\nofficially forbidden to advise their people to vote for 'friends of\r\nreligion,' and those who did so advise were fined after the election to\r\nthe number of 300!\r\n\r\nM. Cornelis Henri de Witt is one of the most active and indefatigable\r\npromoters of what are known as the 'Conférences du Sud-Ouest.' These are\r\nmeetings of the Monarchists organised on a systematic plan, which take\r\nplace at brief intervals throughout the great Departments of\r\nSouth-Western France under the superintendence of a society of which M.\r\nPrinceteau, a very influential and intelligent citizen of Bordeaux, is\r\nthe President. M. Princeteau, like M. de Witt, is not only an\r\nindefatigable organiser, but an extremely popular and effective orator;\r\nand it is a curious proof of the efficiency of the Conservative\r\nmachinery in South-Western France, that at the Legislative elections of\r\n1889 the Radicals and the Socialists completely disappeared as parties\r\nfrom the contest in the Gironde. Thanks to the _scrutin\r\nd'arrondissement_, several seats from that department which ought to\r\nhave gone to the Monarchists were kept by the Government; but upon the\r\ntotal poll the Monarchists and Revisionists show 84,376 votes against\r\n83,108 given to the Government Republicans. Under the _scrutin de liste_\r\nthe eleven seats for the Gironde would pretty plainly have gone in 1889\r\nto the Monarchists. In 1885 M. Cazauvielle, the leading Republican\r\ndeputy, received 89,153 votes, or 6,000 more than the Republican total\r\nin 1889. As in 1889 the total poll amounted to 167,484 votes, and in\r\n1885 to 162,286, it is clear that the Republican strength fell off, and\r\nthat the Monarchist strength increased in the Gironde between 1885 and\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nM. Princeteau told me that on July 14 he gave a fête in his grounds near\r\nBordeaux to more than five thousand working people. While the fête was\r\ngoing on, a procession of Republicans with bands of music, bent on\r\ncelebrating the fête of the Bastille, passed the grounds more than once\r\nwith the obvious intent of drawing away some of his guests. This they\r\ncompletely failed to do. If the 'fête of the Bastille' was celebrated at\r\nBordeaux as it was at Nîmes, this says as much for the good taste as for\r\nthe sound politics of the Bordeaux workmen. At Nîmes on July 22, more\r\nthan a week after the 'anniversary,' I found the city streets made\r\nperilous during the day and life made intolerable at night by such a\r\nclamour of chorus singers and such a clatter of fireworks as I had not\r\nsupposed it possible could be got up beyond the domain of our own\r\n'glorious and immortal' American Fourth of July. Several accidents were\r\ncaused by 'serpents' and other fireworks, and when I asked a staid and\r\nsober citizen of this old Protestant capital why the law permitted such\r\nperformances, he quietly answered: 'The law does not permit them. The\r\nauthorities have formally forbidden them, but the authorities are\r\nelective, and they are more anxious to keep their places than to keep\r\nthe peace.' To my question whether the extreme Radicals were very strong\r\nin Nîmes, he replied that nearly a fourth of the Republicans of Nîmes\r\nare avowed Socialists, mostly of the Anti-Boulangist Anti-Possibilist\r\ntype. One of their candidates for a legislative seat announced his\r\nintention, if elected, to give some person, to be designated by his\r\nconstituents, an order for one half of his legislative salary, to be\r\ndrawn regularly, and applied 'by his committee to political purposes.'\r\nHis political programme included the formal abolition of the Presidency,\r\nannual legislative elections, the nationalisation of the soil of France,\r\nthe abolition of the regular army, the socialisation of all the means of\r\nproduction, gratuitous and obligatory education on the same lines for\r\nall the children of France, and through all the degrees of education,\r\nand the suppression of the right to bequeath or to inherit property of\r\nany kind,' On the latter point a rather intelligent Socialist with whom\r\nI made acquaintance while I was visiting the fine Roman Amphitheatre at\r\nNîmes, and whom I took to be a skilled mechanic, was very explicit. He\r\nthought property a 'privilege' and therefore inconsistent with equality.\r\nHe spoke in an oracular fashion, and he probably belonged to the class\r\nknown among French workmen, not as '_sublimes_,' but as _'les fils de\r\nDieu_.' 'Of what use,' he said, 'is it to abolish hereditary titles if\r\nyou allow a man of one generation to give his son in the next generation\r\nthe more serious advantage over his fellow of a property which he has\r\ndone nothing and could do nothing to create?' I asked him if he agreed\r\nwith St.-Just that 'opulence is an infamy.' He replied very seriously:\r\n'Yes, I think if St.-Just said that he said the truth. Certainly I do\r\nnot say that every rich man is infamous. That is another matter. But it\r\nis infamous that in a land of equality one man should have the means to\r\ngive himself pleasures and execute achievements beyond his\r\nfellow-citizens.' He told me that he lived in Alais, where he said the\r\nSocialists of his type were much stronger than in Nîmes. The Legislative\r\nelections show that lie was right as to this. The Socialists carried the\r\nfirst division of Alais, throwing 7,205 votes against 2,425 Radicals and\r\n4,218 Government Republicans. For the Government Republicans my friend\r\nof the Amphitheatre could find no words of contempt strong enough.\r\n'They are all whitewashed Wilsons,' he said, and then he dilated with\r\nmuch eloquence on the case of a certain M. Hude,'a great friend of\r\nRochefort' he scornfully exclaimed, 'who is a great friend of Boulanger.\r\n_Ah! voilà du propre!_ he is a wine-merchant, of course he is fond of\r\nthe _pots-de-vin'_(the French phrase for bribes taken to promote jobs),\r\n'and thus, when the chemical officers go to verify the quality of his\r\nwines, he calls in the Prefect of Police to prevent it, because he is a\r\ndeputy!' He was particularly bitter, too, on the conversion by the\r\nRepublicans of more than a thousand millions of francs lying in the\r\nsavings banks into 3 per cent. funds. 'What right had they to do this?'\r\nhe said indignantly. 'It was a trick to enslave the depositors!'\r\n\r\nIn the first division of Nîmes the Socialists showed no great strength\r\nat the elections of 1889. The Monarchists far outnumbered them, but they\r\nthrew votes enough to make the election very close, the Republicans\r\nnumbering 6,598, the Socialists 1,519, and the Monarchists 8,174, so\r\nthat the latter won the day by no more than fifty-seven votes. That they\r\nwon it is due to the cordial co-operation of the Protestants with the\r\nCatholics on the question of Religious Liberty in support of a Catholic,\r\nM. de Bernis, who had twice been condemned to imprisonment for\r\n'assisting' Catholic teachers thrown on the world by the 'laicization'\r\nof the schools of Nîmes! This co-operation began in 1885. The\r\nProtestants of the Gard have quite as much at stake in this conflict as\r\nthe Catholics. The Protestant Seminaries are cut down like the Catholic.\r\nThe appropriations formerly made in aid of new Protestant parishes are\r\nmade no longer. No sums are allowed for Protestant missionary work in\r\noutlying districts. The Protestant Consistories have been deprived of\r\ntheir right to nominate candidates for examination as teachers. The\r\nConsistories and the Councils of the Elders are no longer allowed to\r\nreceive and administer legacies for the relief of the poor, for\r\nhospitals or asylums. Formerly, where no manse existed in a commune, the\r\nProtestant minister was allowed a certain sum for lodgings. This has\r\nbeen stopped. In short, the Protestants, like the Catholics of France,\r\nfind themselves treated by an oligarchy of irreligious fanatics as\r\npariahs in their own country. The Protestants, like the Catholics, are\r\ndriven into irreconcilable hostility against the Republic by a\r\nParliamentary majority which treats all religious questions in the\r\nspirit of M. de Mortillet, Mayor of St.-Germain, and a Radical deputy\r\nfor the Seine-et-Oise. In 1886 some speaker in the Chamber appealed in\r\nthe course of his speech to the law of God. 'The law of God!' broke in\r\nM. de Mortillet; 'pray, what is God?'\r\n\r\nThe more completely this spirit of the Mayor of St.-Germian gets the\r\ncontrol of the Republican party, the more obvious it becomes that the\r\nRepublic must gravitate into Socialism.\r\n\r\nAs it steadily alienates from itself the vast multitudes of Frenchmen\r\nwho are either religious men, or recognise the vital importance of\r\nreligious institutions to the existing social order, it is compelled to\r\ncourt the alliance of the avowed enemies of the existing social order.\r\nThis is strikingly illustrated in the political condition of the great\r\nSouthern Department of the Bouches-du-Rhône. This department offers a\r\nmost instructive contrast with the Calvados.\r\n\r\nIn the Bouches-du-Rhône, the Government Republicans were as badly beaten\r\nin 1889 as in the Calvados. But in the Calvados they were beaten by the\r\nMonarchists, and in the Bouches-du-Rhône by the Radicals and the\r\nSocialists.\r\n\r\nIn the Bouches-du-Rhône the Radicals and Socialists threw 52,989 votes,\r\nthe Government Republicans no more than 7,218. Marseilles, the greatest\r\ncommercial city in France, a city of 'Republicans before the Republic,'\r\nwith traditions which give dignity to its democratic tendencies,\r\nrepudiated the Republic of M. Jules Ferry and M. Carnot as emphatically\r\nas the Monarchical Morbihan. Even the Boulangists were nearly twice as\r\nstrong, and the Monarchists were more than twice as strong in Marseilles\r\nas the Opportunist Republicans. The Boulangists threw there 13,123, and\r\nthe Monarchists 14,445 votes. The strength of the Boulangists gives zest\r\nto a terse verdict upon the '_brav' général_' which I heard delivered by\r\na _cocher_ in Marseilles on the eve of the famous January elections in\r\nParis. Passing through one of the squares of the Mediterranean city, I\r\nobserved two _cochers_ engaged in an animated debate. One of them from\r\nhis box exclaimed 'I tell you Boulanger is the only real man in France!'\r\nTo which the other replied as vehemently, 'And I tell you that he is\r\nnothing but the dealer in a low political hell! _c'est un croupier de\r\nmauvais aloi!_' He may have picked up the phrase from the _Petit\r\nMarseillais_, which is one of the few really well-edited newspapers in\r\nFrance. But it was a notable phrase, and it expresses, I think, the\r\nopinion of the sincere Radicals and Socialists, not only as to General\r\nBoulanger, but as to the politicians, now his bitterest enemies, who\r\nwere his original friends and 'promoters.' A very smart and outspoken\r\nProvençal Socialist who drove me on a delightful morning from the once\r\nroyal and always delectable city of Arles to the majestic ruins of\r\nMontmajeur, and the unique and wonderful deserted fortress-city of Les\r\nBaux, set no bounds to his speech about the official Republicans. We met\r\nnear Montmajeur a neat private carriage. 'That is the carriage of\r\nM----,' he said, as we passed on. 'He is an aristocrat--but I think he\r\nwill be Mayor of Axles. We have had an aristocratic major who gave to\r\nthe people, and a Republican mayor who took from the people. I prefer\r\nthe aristocrat, till we can make an end of all majors and all this\r\nrubbish of governments.' At the Legislative elections the Monarchists of\r\nAries threw 8,540 votes, the Radicals 9,858, and the Government\r\nRepublicans none at all. Of course the Radical members support the\r\nGovernment--but on their own terms. As these terms grow more exacting,\r\nthe strength of the Monarchist reaction increases, and as the\r\nMonarchists grow stronger the Radical exactions become more imperious.\r\nThe most active and earnest Monarchist whom I met in Marseilles, M.\r\nFournier, assures me that the Marseilles Radicals are more intolerant of\r\nthe Opportunists than they are even of the Monarchists.\r\n\r\nAs one of the largest employers of labour in Marseilles, M. Fournier is\r\nin constant touch with the working population of the Bouches-du-Rhône.\r\nHe is an earnest and devoted Catholic, and he has encouraged the\r\nfoundation of a Christian Corporation among the people employed in his\r\nworks. These works were founded half a century ago, in 1840, for the\r\npurpose of turning to practical results the interesting discoveries then\r\nmade by M. Chevreuil, the famous centenarian dean of French science, as\r\nto the nature and properties of fatty substances. At the outset these\r\nworks were taken up with the manufacture of stearine candles; but as in\r\nthe case of the glass works of St.-Gobain, the chemical processes\r\nemployed in creating one particular product were soon found to yield\r\nother very different and not less valuable results. I shall not attempt\r\nto enter into the mysteries of saponification and distillation, which\r\ncease to be mysteries when they are followed up from point to point\r\nthrough the extensive and orderly organisation of the Fournier Works;\r\nsuffice it that at these works 600 men and 400 women are busily employed\r\nin turning every year 13,000 tons of African palm-oil, and of\r\nAustralian, Russian, French, and American tallow into stearine candles,\r\noleine, and glycerine. The output is enormous, amounting annually to\r\n20,000,000 packets of candles of an average weight of 400 grammes a\r\npacket, to 3,300,000 kilogrammes of oleine, and to 1,200,000 kilogrammes\r\nof glycerine. How much of this latter product goes to the pharmacies and\r\nhow much to the powder magazines of the world it is not easy to say. But\r\nit is easy to see that if the Bouches-du-Rhône get the better of the\r\nCalvados in the politics of France, there will be a serious falling off\r\nin the demand for altar lights and chamber candles, and a still more\r\nserious increase in the demand for nitro-glycerine!\r\n\r\nThe output of the Fournier Works represents about one-fourth of the\r\nwhole stearine and glycerine production of France, and as paraffin has\r\nof late years largely taken the place of stearine in the famous Price\r\nWorks in England, the Fournier Works are now doubtless the most\r\nimportant of their kind in the world. Thirty years ago the candles\r\nproduced here were almost all exported; now the home consumption just\r\nabout equals the exportation, a fact as to which the truly paternal\r\nGovernment of France takes pains to leave no doubt in the minds of the\r\nproducers by taxing candles heavily as an 'article of luxury.' They are\r\nsubjected to a régie like cigars, and to the octroi, and these imposts,\r\nM. Fournier tells me, now amount to about fifty per cent, of their\r\nvalue. A knowledge of this circumstance may, perhaps, divert the wrath\r\nof travellers in France from the hotel-keeper, who claps a couple of\r\nfrancs for bougies into your bill if you pass half a summer's day in his\r\nhouse, to the Government which concerns itself much more actively with\r\nsqueezing percentages out of the industries than with balancing the\r\nnational budgets of France. Must not all taxes be paid by the ultimate\r\nconsumer? What with these taxes and with the higher wage of labour in\r\nFrance, the stearine works of Marseilles find themselves taken at\r\nadvantage by the energetic manufacturers of Holland. In the Fournier\r\nWorks the average workman earns a daily wage of from 3 frs. 25 c. to 3\r\nfrs. 50 c.; the average workwomen, who do chiefly the clean and even\r\npretty work of moulding the candles, making them up into packets, in\r\nlarge, very well ventilated and well ordered rooms, earn an average\r\ndaily wage of 2 frs. 50 c. Both men and women work about ten hours a\r\nday. The 'eight-hours' doctrine of the political Socialists finds no\r\nmore favour here with the real working people apparently than elsewhere\r\nin France. In Holland and Belgium and at Roubaix the average wage is\r\nabout one franc less for both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Corporation of the Fournier Works is organised upon the\r\nprinciples, but not exactly upon the lines, of the Harmel system. It is\r\nformed by a union of five religious associations among the workpeople,\r\nmade up of the men, the married women, the young men, the young girls,\r\nand the children. Character and conduct are the conditions of\r\nmembership, and under the direction of a General Council in which the\r\nemployers take an active part, the Corporation has founded and\r\nadministers for the common benefit a Consumers' Society which maintains\r\nan economical kitchen with refectories, a recreation hall with a bar,\r\n(not limited to soda water, lemonade, and tea), and a circulating\r\nlibrary. The statutes of this Society leave the members a wide range of\r\nliberty, and the managers are chosen by the members. Of the profits five\r\nper cent first go to the reserve fund; dividends may then be declared of\r\nnot more than ten per cent, on the capital stock of 10,000 francs, and\r\nthe surplus, if any, forms a supplementary reserve. The economical\r\nkitchen is so well managed that it gives a customer (who must be\r\nemployed in the works, but need not be a member of the Association) for\r\n55 centimes, or a little more than fivepence, a bowl of soup, a large\r\nhelping of meat and vegetables, half a pound of bread, and a third of a\r\nbottle of wine. A café-cognac (and the cognac good) may be had for 25\r\ncentimes more.\r\n\r\nIn August of last year, with the help of the owners of the works, a\r\nMusical Society was established, and the workpeople are furnished\r\ngratuitously with medical advice and medicines. To these, in the case of\r\ninvalid workmen who have been for two years employed in the works, is\r\nadded a weekly allowance of six francs during illness. The owners have\r\nalso founded a savings bank which pays six per cent. on sums below 3,000\r\nfrancs, and four per cent. on sums above that amount. These are open to\r\nall the workpeople employed in the works, whether members or not of the\r\nChristian Corporation.\r\n\r\nIn this fashion M. Fournier, and other devout and practical Catholics of\r\nthe Bouches-du-Rhône are fighting the Republic by fighting the\r\nSocialistic Radicalism of which their department is the true\r\nheadquarters, and to which the Republic has substantially surrendered.\r\nIt is visibly an uphill fight in the Bouches-du-Rhône, and in\r\nSouth-Eastern France generally. But there is life in the convictions\r\nwhich nerve men to fight an uphill fight, and there is something in the\r\nfire and spirit of these militant Catholics of France which reminds one\r\nof Prudentius, the Pindar of Christian Spain, celebrating fifteen\r\ncenturies ago the believers who upheld so manfully the rights of\r\nconscience against prætors and prefects bent on converting them to the\r\nbeauty of 'moral unity'--_quod princeps colit ut colamus omnes_!\r\n\r\nWhen two men ride on a horse the man who holds the bridle is the master,\r\nand the Radicals hold the bridle of the French Government. The Radical\r\nDepartment of the Bouches-du-Rhône represents the Republic. The\r\nMonarchist Department of the Calvados represents France. If the Republic\r\nwins, the history of France before 1789 will be wiped out as with a\r\nsponge, and with it all the great qualities of the French people must\r\ndisappear. Without an Executive, without a Past, and without a Religion,\r\nFrance would become the ideal nation of the Nihilists.\r\n\r\nIf France wins, if she recovers the Executive unity and stability\r\nessential to her life as a nation, recovers the historic sense of her\r\nnational growth into greatness, recovers for every man, woman, and child\r\nin France the simple human right to believe and to hope, then the\r\nRepublic must inevitably vanish, for with all these things the Republic\r\nhas made itself incompatible.\r\n\r\nIf these were only my own conclusions, drawn from all that I saw and\r\nheard and learned in France during the year 1889, I might hesitate to\r\nadopt them as adequate and final.\r\n\r\nBut how can I hesitate, when I find these conclusions of mine not\r\nobscurely foreshadowed as impending in 1872 by Ernest Renan, and\r\nre-affirmed as imminent in 1882 by Jules Simon?\r\n\r\n'The edifice of our chimæras,' cried Ernest Renan in 1872,[9] 'has\r\nmelted away like fairy castles in a dream.\r\n\r\n    [9] _La Réforme intellectuelle et morale._ Ernest Renan. Paris,\r\n    1872.\r\n\r\nPresumption, puerile vanity, insubordination, feather-headedness,\r\ninability to grasp many different ideas at a glance, want of scientific\r\nsense, simple and stupid ignorance, here is the summary of our history\r\nfor a year!... The Opposition, which pretended to have revolutionary\r\nremedies for all possible ills, has found itself at the end of a few\r\ndays as unpopular as the fallen dynasty. The Republican Party, puffed up\r\nwith the fatal errors which for half a century have been current as to\r\nthe history of the Revolution, and which imagined itself able to play\r\nover again a game won eighty years ago only through circumstances\r\nutterly unlike those of to-day, has learned that it was a lunatic taking\r\nvisions for realities. The legend of the Empire has been slain by\r\nNapoleon III. The legend of 1792 has been done to death by M. Gambetta.\r\nThe legend of the Terror (for even the Terror had its legend among us!)\r\nhas been hideously parodied by the Commune.'\r\n\r\nSo cried M. Renan in 1872.\r\n\r\n'Our worst disasters,' said M. Jules Simon in 1882,[10] 'have so far\r\nbroken out only where great numbers of men are crowded together. Men\r\nbegin with scepticism, from scepticism they go on rapidly to Nihilism,\r\nand from Nihilism to Social War. The labourer in the fields still has\r\nhis faith; he still has his hope of another life; he has not yet\r\nunlearned the name of God. When he becomes a Nihilist we shall have the\r\nCommune in our cities, and beyond them the Jacqueries! It is impossible\r\nthat the authorities should not see this. But the authorities obey the\r\ndeputy, the deputy obeys the elector, and the elector obeys the\r\nagitator.'\r\n\r\n    [10] _Dieu, Patrie, Liberté._ Par Jules Simon. Paris, 1882.\r\n\r\n'There will soon be only two parties left in France; the party of the\r\ndynamiters, and the party of the do-nothings. Whatever moderate\r\nRepublicans are left must go over either to violence or to\r\nindifference. Is it France alone which is thus threatened? It is the\r\nworld. The Communists and the Fenians were not produced in France. But\r\nFrance attracts them.\r\n\r\n'The liberty you pretend to be establishing is oppression. The neutral\r\neducation you propose is the suppression of the human heart, of the\r\nhuman conscience.\r\n\r\n'This \"clericalism\" which you declare to be the enemy, and which, when\r\nyou are pushed to the wall, turns out to be Christianity--this\r\n\"clericalism\" which you attack and mean to exterminate, tell me, is this\r\nthe power which lays your Ministers prostrate before your Deputies, and\r\nyour Deputies prostrate before their electors? Is it \"clericalism\" which\r\nis stirring up Labour against Capital? Is it \"clericalism\" which\r\npreaches and supports \"strikes\"? Is it \"clericalism\" which manufactures\r\ndynamite and blows up houses? Is it \"clericalism\" which is transforming\r\nyour literature into ribaldry and your theatres into brothels? Is it\r\n\"clericalism\" which shuts up your schools? Is it \"clericalism\" which\r\ntransforms all the actions and relations of life into matters of\r\ncontract and of calculation? Do you imagine that Christianity, if it be\r\nyour enemy, is an enemy as terrible as Nihilism? And what other end but\r\nNihilism can there be of your \"neutral\" obligatory schools and your\r\natheistic laws? Already you go in fear of the very phrase which\r\nrecognises the duties of man to God! You think it dangerous, you think\r\nit equivocal! You do not know that when you recoil before the name of\r\nGod you abandon the traditions of France!\r\n\r\n'Nay, you will not even hear now of man's duties to his country! This is\r\nanother \"dangerous,\" another \"equivocal\" phrase! You talk now in your\r\nprogrammes about the \"civic duties\" of man, for when these are taught\r\nthere will be no danger of confounding the Monarchical France before\r\n1789, which we must learn to hate, with the Republican France which we\r\nmust love and admire!'\r\n\r\nThus spoke Jules Simon in 1882.\r\n\r\nThe 'civic duties' of man brought France in 1792 to the 'Law of\r\nSuspects,' to the headlong and brutal demolition of the whole social\r\nedifice, to confiscation, and to the guillotine.\r\n\r\nTo what will the 'civic duties' of man bring France, and, with France,\r\nthe civilization of Christendom, in 1892?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: France]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalogue of Books\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\nMESSRS.
