Wells-Barnett\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater part of what is contained in these pages was published in the\r\n_New York Age_ June 25, 1892, in explanation of the editorial which the\r\nMemphis whites considered sufficiently infamous to justify the destruction\r\nof my paper, the _Free Speech_.\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of that statement, requests have come from all parts\r\nof the country that \"Exiled\" (the name under which it then appeared) be\r\nissued in pamphlet form. Some donations were made, but not enough for that\r\npurpose. The noble effort of the ladies of New York and Brooklyn Oct. 5\r\nhave enabled me to comply with this request and give the world a true,\r\nunvarnished account of the causes of lynch law in the South.\r\n\r\nThis statement is not a shield for the despoiler of virtue, nor altogether\r\na defense for the poor blind Afro-American Sampsons who suffer themselves\r\nto be betrayed by white Delilahs. It is a contribution to truth, an array\r\nof facts, the perusal of which it is hoped will stimulate this great\r\nAmerican Republic to demand that justice be done though the heavens fall.\r\n\r\nIt is with no pleasure I have dipped my hands in the corruption here\r\nexposed. Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned\r\nagainst than sinning, and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so. The\r\nawful death-roll that Judge Lynch is calling every week is appalling, not\r\nonly because of the lives it takes, the rank cruelty and outrage to the\r\nvictims, but because of the prejudice it fosters and the stain it places\r\nagainst the good name of a weak race.\r\n\r\nThe Afro-American is not a bestial race. If this work can contribute in\r\nany way toward proving this, and at the same time arouse the conscience of\r\nthe American people to a demand for justice to every citizen, and\r\npunishment by law for the lawless, I shall feel I have done my race a\r\nservice. Other considerations are of minor importance.\r\n\r\nIDA B. WELLS\r\n_New York City_, Oct. 26, 1892\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Afro-American women of New York and Brooklyn, whose race love,\r\nearnest zeal and unselfish effort at Lyric Hall, in the City of New York,\r\non the night of October 5, 1892--made possible its publication, this\r\npamphlet is gratefully dedicated by the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHON. FRED. DOUGLASS'S LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dear Miss Wells:_\r\n\r\nLet me give you thanks for your faithful paper on the lynch abomination\r\nnow generally practiced against colored people in the South. There has\r\nbeen no word equal to it in convincing power. I have spoken, but my word\r\nis feeble in comparison. You give us what you know and testify from actual\r\nknowledge. You have dealt with the facts with cool, painstaking fidelity\r\nand left those naked and uncontradicted facts to speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nBrave woman! you have done your people and mine a service which can\r\nneither be weighed nor measured. If American conscience were only half\r\nalive, if the American church and clergy were only half christianized, if\r\nAmerican moral sensibility were not hardened by persistent infliction of\r\noutrage and crime against colored people, a scream of horror, shame and\r\nindignation would rise to Heaven wherever your pamphlet shall be read.\r\n\r\nBut alas! even crime has power to reproduce itself and create conditions\r\nfavorable to its own existence. It sometimes seems we are deserted by\r\nearth and Heaven yet we must still think, speak and work, and trust in the\r\npower of a merciful God for final deliverance.\r\n\r\nVery truly and gratefully yours,\r\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS\r\n_Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C._, Oct. 25, 1892\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 _The_ OFFENSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday evening May 24, 1892, the city of Memphis was filled with\r\nexcitement. Editorials in the daily papers of that date caused a meeting\r\nto be held in the Cotton Exchange Building; a committee was sent for the\r\neditors of the _Free Speech_ an Afro-American journal published in that\r\ncity, and the only reason the open threats of lynching that were made were\r\nnot carried out was because they could not be found. The cause of all this\r\ncommotion was the following editorial published in the _Free Speech_ May\r\n21, 1892, the Saturday previous.\r\n\r\n  Eight negroes lynched since last issue of the _Free Speech_ one at\r\n  Little Rock, Ark., last Saturday morning where the citizens broke(?)\r\n  into the penitentiary and got their man; three near Anniston, Ala., one\r\n  near New Orleans; and three at Clarksville, Ga., the last three for\r\n  killing a white man, and five on the same old racket--the new alarm\r\n  about raping white women. The same programme of hanging, then shooting\r\n  bullets into the lifeless bodies was carried out to the letter.\r\n\r\n  Nobody in this section of the country believes the old thread-bare lie\r\n  that Negro men rape white women. If Southern white men are not careful,\r\n  they will overreach themselves and public sentiment will have a\r\n  reaction; a conclusion will then be reached which will be very damaging\r\n  to the moral reputation of their women.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Commercial_ of Wednesday following, May 25, contained the\r\nfollowing leader:\r\n\r\n  Those negroes who are attempting to make the lynching of individuals of\r\n  their race a means for arousing the worst passions of their kind are\r\n  playing with a dangerous sentiment. The negroes may as well understand\r\n  that there is no mercy for the negro rapist and little patience with his\r\n  defenders. A negro organ printed in this city, in a recent issue\r\n  publishes the following atrocious paragraph: \"Nobody in this section of\r\n  the country believes the old thread-bare lie that negro men rape white\r\n  women. If Southern white men are not careful they will overreach\r\n  themselves, and public sentiment will have a reaction; and a conclusion\r\n  will be reached which will be very damaging to the moral reputation of\r\n  their women.\"\r\n\r\n  The fact that a black scoundrel is allowed to live and utter such\r\n  loathsome and repulsive calumnies is a volume of evidence as to the\r\n  wonderful patience of Southern whites. But we have had enough of it.\r\n\r\n  There are some things that the Southern white man will not tolerate, and\r\n  the obscene intimations of the foregoing have brought the writer to the\r\n  very outermost limit of public patience. We hope we have said enough.\r\n\r\nThe _Evening Scimitar_ of same date, copied the _Commercial_'s editorial\r\nwith these words of comment:\r\n\r\n  Patience under such circumstances is not a virtue. If the negroes\r\n  themselves do not apply the remedy without delay it will be the duty of\r\n  those whom he has attacked to tie the wretch who utters these calumnies\r\n  to a stake at the intersection of Main and Madison Sts., brand him in\r\n  the forehead with a hot iron and perform upon him a surgical operation\r\n  with a pair of tailor's shears.\r\n\r\nActing upon this advice, the leading citizens met in the Cotton Exchange\r\nBuilding the same evening, and threats of lynching were freely indulged,\r\nnot by the lawless element upon which the deviltry of the South is usually\r\nsaddled--but by the leading business men, in their leading business\r\ncentre. Mr. Fleming, the business manager and owning a half interest the\r\n_Free Speech_, had to leave town to escape the mob, and was afterwards\r\nordered not to return; letters and telegrams sent me in New York where I\r\nwas spending my vacation advised me that bodily harm awaited my return.\r\nCreditors took possession of the office and sold the outfit, and the _Free\r\nSpeech_ was as if it had never been.\r\n\r\nThe editorial in question was prompted by the many inhuman and fiendish\r\nlynchings of Afro-Americans which have recently taken place and was meant\r\nas a warning. Eight lynched in one week and five of them charged with\r\nrape! The thinking public will not easily believe freedom and education\r\nmore brutalizing than slavery, and the world knows that the crime of rape\r\nwas unknown during four years of civil war, when the white women of the\r\nSouth were at the mercy of the race which is all at once charged with\r\nbeing a bestial one.\r\n\r\nSince my business has been destroyed and I am an exile from home because\r\nof that editorial, the issue has been forced, and as the writer of it I\r\nfeel that the race and the public generally should have a statement of the\r\nfacts as they exist. They will serve at the same time as a defense for the\r\nAfro-Americans Sampsons who suffer themselves to be betrayed by white\r\nDelilahs.\r\n\r\nThe whites of Montgomery, Ala., knew J.C. Duke sounded the keynote of the\r\nsituation--which they would gladly hide from the world, when he said in\r\nhis paper, the _Herald_, five years ago: \"Why is it that white women\r\nattract negro men now more than in former days? There was a time when such\r\na thing was unheard of. There is a secret to this thing, and we greatly\r\nsuspect it is the growing appreciation of white Juliets for colored\r\nRomeos.\" Mr. Duke, like the _Free Speech_ proprietors, was forced to leave\r\nthe city for reflecting on the \"honah\" of white women and his paper\r\nsuppressed; but the truth remains that Afro-American men do not always\r\nrape(?) white women without their consent.\r\n\r\nMr. Duke, before leaving Montgomery, signed a card disclaiming any\r\nintention of slandering Southern white women. The editor of the _Free\r\nSpeech_ has no disclaimer to enter, but asserts instead that there are\r\nmany white women in the South who would marry colored men if such an act\r\nwould not place them at once beyond the pale of society and within the\r\nclutches of the law. The miscegnation laws of the South only operate\r\nagainst the legitimate union of the races; they leave the white man free\r\nto seduce all the colored girls he can, but it is death to the colored man\r\nwho yields to the force and advances of a similar attraction in white\r\nwomen. White men lynch the offending Afro-American, not because he is a\r\ndespoiler of virtue, but because he succumbs to the smiles of white women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n_The_ BLACK _and_ WHITE _of_ IT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Cleveland Gazette_ of January 16, 1892, publishes a case in point.\r\nMrs. J.S. Underwood, the wife of a minister of Elyria, Ohio, accused an\r\nAfro-American of rape. She told her husband that during his absence in\r\n1888, stumping the State for the Prohibition Party, the man came to the\r\nkitchen door, forced his way in the house and insulted her. She tried to\r\ndrive him out with a heavy poker, but he overpowered and chloroformed her,\r\nand when she revived her clothing was torn and she was in a horrible\r\ncondition. She did not know the man but could identify him. She pointed\r\nout William Offett, a married man, who was arrested and, being in Ohio,\r\nwas granted a trial.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner vehemently denied the charge of rape, but confessed he went\r\nto Mrs. Underwood's residence at her invitation and was criminally\r\nintimate with her at her request. This availed him nothing against the\r\nsworn testimony of a ministers wife, a lady of the highest respectability.\r\nHe was found guilty, and entered the penitentiary, December 14, 1888, for\r\nfifteen years. Some time afterwards the woman's remorse led her to confess\r\nto her husband that the man was innocent.\r\n\r\nThese are her words:\r\n\r\n  I met Offett at the Post Office. It was raining. He was polite to me,\r\n  and as I had several bundles in my arms he offered to carry them home\r\n  for me, which he did. He had a strange fascination for me, and I invited\r\n  him to call on me. He called, bringing chestnuts and candy for the\r\n  children. By this means we got them to leave us alone in the room. Then\r\n  I sat on his lap. He made a proposal to me and I readily consented. Why\r\n  I did so, I do not know, but that I did is true. He visited me several\r\n  times after that and each time I was indiscreet. I did not care after\r\n  the first time. In fact I could not have resisted, and had no desire to\r\n  resist.\r\n\r\nWhen asked by her husband why she told him she had been outraged, she\r\nsaid: \"I had several reasons for telling you. One was the neighbors saw\r\nthe fellows here, another was, I was afraid I had contracted a loathsome\r\ndisease, and still another was that I feared I might give birth to a Negro\r\nbaby. I hoped to save my reputation by telling you a deliberate lie.\" Her\r\nhusband horrified by the confession had Offett, who had already served\r\nfour years, released and secured a divorce.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of such cases throughout the South, with the\r\ndifference that the Southern white men in insatiate fury wreak their\r\nvengeance without intervention of law upon the Afro-Americans who consort\r\nwith their women. A few instances to substantiate the assertion that some\r\nwhite women love the company of the Afro-American will not be out of\r\nplace. Most of these cases were reported by the daily papers of the South.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1885-86 the wife of a practicing physician in Memphis, in\r\ngood social standing whose name has escaped me, left home, husband and\r\nchildren, and ran away with her black coachman. She was with him a month\r\nbefore her husband found and brought her home. The coachman could not be\r\nfound. The doctor moved his family away from Memphis, and is living in\r\nanother city under an assumed name.\r\n\r\nIn the same city last year a white girl in the dusk of evening screamed at\r\nthe approach of some parties that a Negro had assaulted her on the street.\r\nHe was captured, tried by a white judge and jury, that acquitted him of\r\nthe charge. It is needless to add if there had been a scrap of evidence on\r\nwhich to convict him of so grave a charge he would have been convicted.\r\n\r\nSarah Clark of Memphis loved a black man and lived openly with him. When\r\nshe was indicted last spring for miscegenation, she swore in court that\r\nshe was _not_ a white woman. This she did to escape the penitentiary and\r\ncontinued her illicit relation undisturbed. That she is of the lower class\r\nof whites, does not disturb the fact that she is a white woman. \"The\r\nleading citizens\" of Memphis are defending the \"honor\" of _all_ white\r\nwomen, _demi-monde_ included.\r\n\r\nSince the manager of the _Free Speech_ has been run away from Memphis by\r\nthe guardians of the honor of Southern white women, a young girl living on\r\nPoplar St., who was discovered in intimate relations with a handsome\r\nmulatto young colored man, Will Morgan by name, stole her father's money\r\nto send the young fellow away from that father's wrath. She has since\r\njoined him in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe _Memphis Ledger_ for June 8 has the following:\r\n\r\n  If Lillie Bailey, a rather pretty white girl seventeen years of age, who\r\n  is now at the City Hospital, would be somewhat less reserved about her\r\n  disgrace there would be some very nauseating details in the story of her\r\n  life. She is the mother of a little coon. The truth might reveal fearful\r\n  depravity or it might reveal the evidence of a rank outrage. She will\r\n  not divulge the name of the man who has left such black evidence of her\r\n  disgrace, and, in fact, says it is a matter in which there can be no\r\n  interest to the outside world. She came to Memphis nearly three months\r\n  ago and was taken in at the Woman's Refuge in the southern part of the\r\n  city. She remained there until a few weeks ago, when the child was born.\r\n  The ladies in charge of the Refuge were horified. The girl was at once\r\n  sent to the City Hospital, where she has been since May 30. She is a\r\n  country girl. She came to Memphis from her fathers farm, a short\r\n  distance from Hernando, Miss. Just when she left there she would not\r\n  say. In fact she says she came to Memphis from Arkansas, and says her\r\n  home is in that State. She is rather good looking, has blue eyes, a low\r\n  forehead and dark red hair. The ladies at the Woman's Refuge do not know\r\n  anything about the girl further than what they learned when she was an\r\n  inmate of the institution; and she would not tell much. When the child\r\n  was born an attempt was made to get the girl to reveal the name of the\r\n  Negro who had disgraced her, she obstinately refused and it was\r\n  impossible to elicit any information from her on the subject.\r\n\r\nNote the wording. \"The truth might reveal fearful depravity or rank\r\noutrage.\" If it had been a white child or Lillie Bailey had told a pitiful\r\nstory of Negro outrage, it would have been a case of woman's weakness or\r\nassault and she could have remained at the Woman's Refuge. But a Negro\r\nchild and to withhold its father's name and thus prevent the killing of\r\nanother Negro \"rapist.\" A case of \"fearful depravity.\"\r\n\r\nThe very week the \"leading citizens\" of Memphis were making a spectacle of\r\nthemselves in defense of all white women of every kind, an Afro-American,\r\nM. Stricklin, was found in a white woman's room in that city. Although\r\nshe made no outcry of rape, he was jailed and would have been lynched, but\r\nthe woman stated she bought curtains of him (he was a furniture dealer)\r\nand his business in her room that night was to put them up. A white\r\nwoman's word was taken as absolutely in this case as when the cry of rape\r\nis made, and he was freed.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of Memphis is true of the entire South. The daily papers last\r\nyear reported a farmer's wife in Alabama had given birth to a Negro child.\r\nWhen the Negro farm hand who was plowing in the field heard it he took the\r\nmule from the plow and fled. The dispatches also told of a woman in South\r\nCarolina who gave birth to a Negro child and charged three men with being\r\nits father, _every one of whom has since disappeared_. In Tuscumbia, Ala.,\r\nthe colored boy who was lynched there last year for assaulting a white\r\ngirl told her before his accusers that he had met her there in the woods\r\noften before.\r\n\r\nFrank Weems of Chattanooga who was not lynched in May only because the\r\nprominent citizens became his body guard until the doors of the\r\npenitentiary closed on him, had letters in his pocket from the white woman\r\nin the case, making the appointment with him. Edward Coy who was burned\r\nalive in Texarkana, January 1, 1892, died protesting his innocence.\r\nInvestigation since as given by the Bystander in the _Chicago Inter\r\nOcean_, October 1, proves:\r\n\r\n  1. The woman who was paraded as a victim of violence was of bad\r\n  character; her husband was a drunkard and a gambler.\r\n\r\n  2. She was publicly reported and generally known to have been criminally\r\n  intimate with Coy for more than a year previous.\r\n\r\n  3. She was compelled by threats, if not by violence, to make the charge\r\n  against the victim.\r\n\r\n  4. When she came to apply the match Coy asked her if she would burn him\r\n  after they had \"been sweethearting\" so long.\r\n\r\n  5. A large majority of the \"superior\" white men prominent in the affair\r\n  are the reputed fathers of mulatto children.\r\n\r\n  These are not pleasant facts, but they are illustrative of the vital\r\n  phase of the so-called race question, which should properly be\r\n  designated an earnest inquiry as to the best methods by which religion,\r\n  science, law and political power may be employed to excuse injustice,\r\n  barbarity and crime done to a people because of race and color. There\r\n  can be no possible belief that these people were inspired by any\r\n  consuming zeal to vindicate God's law against miscegnationists of the\r\n  most practical sort. The woman was a willing partner in the victim's\r\n  guilt, and being of the \"superior\" race must naturally have been more\r\n  guilty.\r\n\r\nIn Natchez, Miss., Mrs. Marshall, one of the _creme de la creme_ of the\r\ncity, created a tremendous sensation several years ago. She has a black\r\ncoachman who was married, and had been in her employ several years. During\r\nthis time she gave birth to a child whose color was remarked, but traced\r\nto some brunette ancestor, and one of the fashionable dames of the city\r\nwas its godmother. Mrs. Marshall's social position was unquestioned, and\r\nwealth showered every dainty on this child which was idolized with its\r\nbrothers and sisters by its white papa. In course of time another child\r\nappeared on the scene, but it was unmistakably dark. All were alarmed, and\r\n\"rush of blood, strangulation\" were the conjectures, but the doctor, when\r\nasked the cause, grimly told them it was a Negro child. There was a family\r\nconclave, the coachman heard of it and leaving his own family went West,\r\nand has never returned. As soon as Mrs. Marshall was able to travel she\r\nwas sent away in deep disgrace. Her husband died within the year of a\r\nbroken heart.\r\n\r\nEbenzer Fowler, the wealthiest colored man in Issaquena County, Miss., was\r\nshot down on the street in Mayersville, January 30, 1885, just before dark\r\nby an armed body of white men who filled his body with bullets. They\r\ncharged him with writing a note to a white woman of the place, which they\r\nintercepted and which proved there was an intimacy existing between them.\r\n\r\nHundreds of such cases might be cited, but enough have been given to prove\r\nthe assertion that there are white women in the South who love the\r\nAfro-American's company even as there are white men notorious for their\r\npreference for Afro-American women.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a town in the South which has not an instance of the kind\r\nwhich is well known, and hence the assertion is reiterated that \"nobody in\r\nthe South believes the old thread bare lie that negro men rape white\r\nwomen.\" Hence there is a growing demand among Afro-Americans that the\r\nguilt or innocence of parties accused of rape be fully established. They\r\nknow the men of the section of the country who refuse this are not so\r\ndesirous of punishing rapists as they pretend. The utterances of the\r\nleading white men show that with them it is not the crime but the _class_.\r\nBishop Fitzgerald has become apologist for lynchers of the rapists of\r\n_white_ women only. Governor Tillman, of South Carolina, in the month of\r\nJune, standing under the tree in Barnwell, S.C., on which eight\r\nAfro-Americans were hung last year, declared that he would lead a mob to\r\nlynch a _negro_ who raped a _white_ woman. So say the pulpits, officials\r\nand newspapers of the South. But when the victim is a colored woman it is\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nLast winter in Baltimore, Md., three white ruffians assaulted a Miss\r\nCamphor, a young Afro-American girl, while out walking with a young man of\r\nher own race. They held her escort and outraged the girl. It was a deed\r\ndastardly enough to arouse Southern blood, which gives its horror of rape\r\nas excuse for lawlessness, but she was an Afro-American. The case went to\r\nthe courts, an Afro-American lawyer defended the men and they were\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\nIn Nashville, Tenn., there is a white man, Pat Hanifan, who outraged a\r\nlittle Afro-American girl, and, from the physical injuries received, she\r\nhas been ruined for life. He was jailed for six months, discharged, and is\r\nnow a detective in that city. In the same city, last May, a white man\r\noutraged an Afro-American girl in a drug store. He was arrested, and\r\nreleased on bail at the trial. It was rumored that five hundred\r\nAfro-Americans had organized to lynch him. Two hundred and fifty white\r\ncitizens armed themselves with Winchesters and guarded him. A cannon was\r\nplaced in front of his home, and the Buchanan Rifles (State Militia)\r\nordered to the scene for his protection. The Afro-American mob did not\r\nmaterialize. Only two weeks before Eph. Grizzard, who had only been\r\n_charged_ with rape upon a white woman, had been taken from the jail, with\r\nGovernor Buchanan and the police and militia standing by, dragged through\r\nthe streets in broad daylight, knives plunged into him at every step, and\r\nwith every fiendish cruelty a frenzied mob could devise, he was at last\r\nswung out on the bridge with hands cut to pieces as he tried to climb up\r\nthe stanchions. A naked, bloody example of the blood-thirstiness of the\r\nnineteenth-century civilization of the Athens of the South! No cannon or\r\nmilitary was called out in his defense. He dared to visit a white woman.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment these civilized whites were announcing their\r\ndetermination \"to protect their wives and daughters,\" by murdering\r\nGrizzard, a white man was in the same jail for raping eight-year-old\r\nMaggie Reese, an Afro-American girl. He was not harmed. The \"honor\" of\r\ngrown women who were glad enough to be supported by the Grizzard boys and\r\nEd Coy, as long as the liaison was not known, needed protection; they were\r\nwhite. The outrage upon helpless childhood needed no avenging in this\r\ncase; she was black.\r\n\r\nA white man in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory, two months ago inflicted such\r\ninjuries upon another Afro-American child that she died. He was not\r\npunished, but an attempt was made in the same town in the month of June to\r\nlynch an Afro-American who visited a white woman.\r\n\r\nIn Memphis, Tenn., in the month of June, Ellerton L. Dorr, who is the\r\nhusband of Russell Hancock's widow, was arrested for attempted rape on\r\nMattie Cole, a neighbors cook; he was only prevented from accomplishing\r\nhis purpose, by the appearance of Mattie's employer. Dorr's friends say he\r\nwas drunk and not responsible for his actions. The grand jury refused to\r\nindict him and he was discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 _The_ NEW CRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal of Southern whites to Northern sympathy and sanction, the\r\nadroit, insiduous plea made by Bishop Fitzgerald for suspension of\r\njudgment because those \"who condemn lynching express no sympathy for the\r\n_white_ woman in the case,\" falls to the ground in the light of the\r\nforegoing.\r\n\r\nFrom this exposition of the race issue in lynch law, the whole matter is\r\nexplained by the well-known opposition growing out of slavery to the\r\nprogress of the race. This is crystalized in the oft-repeated slogan:\r\n\"This is a white man's country and the white man must rule.\" The South\r\nresented giving the Afro-American his freedom, the ballot box and the\r\nCivil Rights Law. The raids of the Ku-Klux and White Liners to subvert\r\nreconstruction government, the Hamburg and Ellerton, S.C., the Copiah\r\nCounty, Miss., and the Layfayette Parish, La., massacres were excused as\r\nthe natural resentment of intelligence against government by ignorance.\r\n\r\nHonest white men practically conceded the necessity of intelligence\r\nmurdering ignorance to correct the mistake of the general government, and\r\nthe race was left to the tender mercies of the solid South. Thoughtful\r\nAfro-Americans with the strong arm of the government withdrawn and with\r\nthe hope to stop such wholesale massacres urged the race to sacrifice its\r\npolitical rights for sake of peace. They honestly believed the race should\r\nfit itself for government, and when that should be done, the objection to\r\nrace participation in politics would be removed.\r\n\r\nBut the sacrifice did not remove the trouble, nor move the South to\r\njustice. One by one the Southern States have legally(?) disfranchised the\r\nAfro-American, and since the repeal of the Civil Rights Bill nearly every\r\nSouthern State has passed separate car laws with a penalty against their\r\ninfringement. The race regardless of advancement is penned into filthy,\r\nstifling partitions cut off from smoking cars. All this while, although\r\nthe political cause has been removed, the butcheries of black men at\r\nBarnwell, S.C., Carrolton, Miss., Waycross, Ga., and Memphis, Tenn., have\r\ngone on; also the flaying alive of a man in Kentucky, the burning of one\r\nin Arkansas, the hanging of a fifteen-year-old girl in Louisiana, a woman\r\nin Jackson, Tenn., and one in Hollendale, Miss., until the dark and bloody\r\nrecord of the South shows 728 Afro-Americans lynched during the past eight\r\nyears. Not fifty of these were for political causes; the rest were for all\r\nmanner of accusations from that of rape of white women, to the case of the\r\nboy Will Lewis who was hanged at Tullahoma, Tenn., last year for being\r\ndrunk and \"sassy\" to white folks.\r\n\r\nThese statistics compiled by the _Chicago Tribune_ were given the first of\r\nthis year (1892). Since then, not less than one hundred and fifty have\r\nbeen known to have met violent death at the hands of cruel bloodthirsty\r\nmobs during the past nine months.\r\n\r\nTo palliate this record (which grows worse as the Afro-American becomes\r\nintelligent) and excuse some of the most heinous crimes that ever stained\r\nthe history of a country, the South is shielding itself behind the\r\nplausible screen of defending the honor of its women. This, too, in the\r\nface of the fact that only _one-third_ of the 728 victims to mobs have\r\nbeen _charged_ with rape, to say nothing of those of that one-third who\r\nwere innocent of the charge. A white correspondent of the _Baltimore Sun_\r\ndeclares that the Afro-American who was lynched in Chestertown, Md., in\r\nMay for assault on a white girl was innocent; that the deed was done by a\r\nwhite man who had since disappeared. The girl herself maintained that her\r\nassailant was a white man. When that poor Afro-American was murdered, the\r\nwhites excused their refusal of a trial on the ground that they wished to\r\nspare the white girl the mortification of having to testify in court.\r\n\r\nThis cry has had its effect. It has closed the heart, stifled the\r\nconscience, warped the judgment and hushed the voice of press and pulpit\r\non the subject of lynch law throughout this \"land of liberty.\" Men who\r\nstand high in the esteem of the public for Christian character, for moral\r\nand physical courage, for devotion to the principles of equal and exact\r\njustice to all, and for great sagacity, stand as cowards who fear to open\r\ntheir mouths before this great outrage. They do not see that by their\r\ntacit encouragement, their silent acquiescence, the black shadow of\r\nlawlessness in the form of lynch law is spreading its wings over the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMen who, like Governor Tillman, start the ball of lynch law rolling for a\r\ncertain crime, are powerless to stop it when drunken or criminal white\r\ntoughs feel like hanging an Afro-American on any pretext.\r\n\r\nEven to the better class of Afro-Americans the crime of rape is so\r\nrevolting they have too often taken the white man's word and given lynch\r\nlaw neither the investigation nor condemnation it deserved.\r\n\r\nThey forget that a concession of the right to lynch a man for a certain\r\ncrime, not only concedes the right to lynch any person for any crime, but\r\n(so frequently is the cry of rape now raised) it is in a fair way to stamp\r\nus a race of rapists and desperadoes. They have gone on hoping and\r\nbelieving that general education and financial strength would solve the\r\ndifficulty, and are devoting their energies to the accumulation of both.\r\n\r\nThe mob spirit has grown with the increasing intelligence of the\r\nAfro-American. It has left the out-of-the-way places where ignorance\r\nprevails, has thrown off the mask and with this new cry stalks in broad\r\ndaylight in large cities, the centers of civilization, and is encouraged\r\nby the \"leading citizens\" and the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 _The_ MALICIOUS _and_ UNTRUTHFUL WHITE PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Commercial_ and _Evening Scimitar_ of Memphis, Tenn., are owned\r\nby leading business men of that city, and yet, in spite of the fact that\r\nthere had been no white woman in Memphis outraged by an Afro-American, and\r\nthat Memphis possessed a thrifty law-abiding, property-owning class of\r\nAfro-Americans the _Commercial_ of May 17, under the head of \"More Rapes,\r\nMore Lynchings\" gave utterance to the following:\r\n\r\n  The lynching of three Negro scoundrels reported in our dispatches from\r\n  Anniston, Ala., for a brutal outrage committed upon a white woman will\r\n  be a text for much comment on \"Southern barbarism\" by Northern\r\n  newspapers; but we fancy it will hardly prove effective for campaign\r\n  purposes among intelligent people. The frequency of these lynchings\r\n  calls attention to the frequency of the crimes which causes lynching.\r\n  The \"Southern barbarism\" which deserves the serious attention of all\r\n  people North and South, is the barbarism which preys upon weak and\r\n  defenseless women. Nothing but the most prompt, speedy and extreme\r\n  punishment can hold in check the horrible and beastial propensities of\r\n  the Negro race. There is a strange similarity about a number of cases of\r\n  this character which have lately occurred.\r\n\r\n  In each case the crime was deliberately planned and perpetrated by\r\n  several Negroes. They watched for an opportunity when the women were\r\n  left without a protector. It was not a sudden yielding to a fit of\r\n  passion, but the consummation of a devilish purpose which has been\r\n  seeking and waiting for the opportunity. This feature of the crime not\r\n  only makes it the most fiendishly brutal, but it adds to the terror of\r\n  the situation in the thinly settled country communities. No man can\r\n  leave his family at night without the dread that some roving Negro\r\n  ruffian is watching and waiting for this opportunity. The swift\r\n  punishment which invariably follows these horrible crimes doubtless acts\r\n  as a deterring effect upon the Negroes in that immediate neighborhood\r\n  for a short time. But the lesson is not widely learned nor long\r\n  remembered. Then such crimes, equally atrocious, have happened in quick\r\n  succession, one in Tennessee, one in Arkansas, and one in Alabama. The\r\n  facts of the crime appear to appeal more to the Negro's lustful\r\n  imagination than the facts of the punishment do to his fears. He sets\r\n  aside all fear of death in any form when opportunity is found for the\r\n  gratification of his bestial desires.\r\n\r\n  There is small reason to hope for any change for the better. The\r\n  commission of this crime grows more frequent every year. The generation\r\n  of Negroes which have grown up since the war have lost in large measure\r\n  the traditional and wholesome awe of the white race which kept the\r\n  Negroes in subjection, even when their masters were in the army, and\r\n  their families left unprotected except by the slaves themselves. There\r\n  is no longer a restraint upon the brute passion of the Negro.\r\n\r\n  What is to be done? The crime of rape is always horrible, but the\r\n  Southern man there is nothing which so fills the soul with horror,\r\n  loathing and fury as the outraging of a white woman by a Negro. It is\r\n  the race question in the ugliest, vilest, most dangerous aspect. The\r\n  Negro as a political factor can be controlled. But neither laws nor\r\n  lynchings can subdue his lusts. Sooner or later it will force a crisis.\r\n  We do not know in what form it will come.\r\n\r\nIn its issue of June 4, the _Memphis Evening Scimitar_ gives the following\r\nexcuse for lynch law:\r\n\r\n  Aside from the violation of white women by Negroes, which is the\r\n  outcropping of a bestial perversion of instinct, the chief cause of\r\n  trouble between the races in the South is the Negro's lack of manners.\r\n  In the state of slavery he learned politeness from association with\r\n  white people, who took pains to teach him. Since the emancipation came\r\n  and the tie of mutual interest and regard between master and servant was\r\n  broken, the Negro has drifted away into a state which is neither freedom\r\n  nor bondage. Lacking the proper inspiration of the one and the\r\n  restraining force of the other he has taken up the idea that boorish\r\n  insolence is independence, and the exercise of a decent degree of\r\n  breeding toward white people is identical with servile submission. In\r\n  consequence of the prevalence of this notion there are many Negroes who\r\n  use every opportunity to make themselves offensive, particularly when\r\n  they think it can be done with impunity.\r\n\r\n  We have had too many instances right here in Memphis to doubt this, and\r\n  our experience is not exceptional. _The white people won't stand this\r\n  sort of thing, and whether they be insulted as individuals are as a\r\n  race, the response will be prompt and effectual._ The bloody riot of\r\n  1866, in which so many Negroes perished, was brought on principally by\r\n  the outrageous conduct of the blacks toward the whites on the streets.\r\n  It is also a remarkable and discouraging fact that the majority of such\r\n  scoundrels are Negroes who have received educational advantages at the\r\n  hands of the white taxpayers. They have got just enough of learning to\r\n  make them realize how hopelessly their race is behind the other in\r\n  everything that makes a great people, and they attempt to \"get even\" by\r\n  insolence, which is ever the resentment of inferiors. There are\r\n  well-bred Negroes among us, and it is truly unfortunate that they should\r\n  have to pay, even in part, the penalty of the offenses committed by the\r\n  baser sort, but this is the way of the world. The innocent must suffer\r\n  for the guilty. If the Negroes as a people possessed a hundredth part of\r\n  the self-respect which is evidenced by the courteous bearing of some\r\n  that the _Scimitar_ could name, the friction between the races would be\r\n  reduced to a minimum. It will not do to beg the question by pleading\r\n  that many white men are also stirring up strife. The Caucasian\r\n  blackguard simply obeys the promptings of a depraved disposition, and he\r\n  is seldom deliberately rough or offensive toward strangers or\r\n  unprotected women.\r\n\r\n  The Negro tough, on the contrary, is given to just that kind of\r\n  offending, and he almost invariably singles out white people as his\r\n  victims.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 1892, there were lynched in this same city three of the best\r\nspecimens of young since-the-war Afro-American manhood. They were\r\npeaceful, law-abiding citizens and energetic business men.\r\n\r\nThey believed the problem was to be solved by eschewing politics and\r\nputting money in the purse. They owned a flourishing grocery business in a\r\nthickly populated suburb of Memphis, and a white man named Barrett had one\r\non the opposite corner. After a personal difficulty which Barrett sought\r\nby going into the \"People's Grocery\" drawing a pistol and was thrashed by\r\nCalvin McDowell, he (Barrett) threatened to \"clean them out.\" These men\r\nwere a mile beyond the city limits and police protection; hearing that\r\nBarrett's crowd was coming to attack them Saturday night, they mustered\r\nforces, and prepared to defend themselves against the attack.\r\n\r\nWhen Barrett came he led a _posse_ of officers, twelve in number, who\r\nafterward claimed to be hunting a man for whom they had a warrant. That\r\ntwelve men in citizen's clothes should think it necessary to go in the\r\nnight to hunt one man who had never before been arrested, or made any\r\nrecord as a criminal has never been explained. When they entered the back\r\ndoor the young men thought the threatened attack was on, and fired into\r\nthem. Three of the officers were wounded, and when the _defending_ party\r\nfound it was officers of the law upon whom they had fired, they ceased and\r\ngot away.\r\n\r\nThirty-one men were arrested and thrown in jail as \"conspirators,\"\r\nalthough they all declared more than once they did not know they were\r\nfiring on officers. Excitement was at fever beat until the morning papers,\r\ntwo days after, announced that the wounded deputy sheriffs were out of\r\ndanger. This hindered rather than helped the plans of the whites. There\r\nwas no law on the statute books which would execute an Afro-American for\r\nwounding a white man, but the \"unwritten law\" did. Three of these men, the\r\npresident, the manager and clerk of the grocery--\"the leaders of the\r\nconspiracy\"--were secretly taken from jail and lynched in a shockingly\r\nbrutal manner. \"The Negroes are getting too independent,\" they say, \"we\r\nmust teach them a lesson.\"\r\n\r\nWhat lesson? The lesson of subordination. \"Kill the leaders and it will\r\ncow the Negro who dares to shoot a white man, even in self-defense.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the race was wild over the outrage, the mockery of law and\r\njustice which disarmed men and locked them up in jails where they could be\r\neasily and safely reached by the mob--- the Afro-American ministers,\r\nnewspapers and leaders counselled obedience to the law which did not\r\nprotect them.\r\n\r\nTheir counsel was heeded and not a hand was uplifted to resent the\r\noutrage; following the advice of the _Free Speech_, people left the city\r\nin great numbers.\r\n\r\nThe dailies and associated press reports heralded these men to the country\r\nas \"toughs,\" and \"Negro desperadoes who kept a low dive.\" This same press\r\nservice printed that the Negro who was lynched at Indianola, Miss., in\r\nMay, had outraged the sheriff's eight-year-old daughter. The girl was more\r\nthan eighteen years old, and was found by her father in this man's room,\r\nwho was a servant on the place.\r\n\r\nNot content with misrepresenting the race, the mob-spirit was not to be\r\nsatisfied until the paper which was doing all it could to counteract this\r\nimpression was silenced. The colored people were resenting their bad\r\ntreatment in a way to make itself felt, yet gave the mob no excuse for\r\nfurther murder, until the appearance of the editorial which is construed\r\nas a reflection on the \"honor\" of the Southern white women. It is not half\r\nso libelous as that of the _Commercial_ which appeared four days before,\r\nand which has been given in these pages. They would have lynched the\r\nmanager of the _Free Speech_ for exercising the right of free speech if\r\nthey had found him as quickly as they would have hung a rapist, and glad\r\nof the excuse to do so. The owners were ordered not to return, the _Free\r\nSpeech_ was suspended with as little compunction as the business of the\r\n\"People's Grocery\" broken up and the proprietors murdered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 _The_ SOUTH'S POSITION\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry W. Grady in his well-remembered speeches in New England and New York\r\npictured the Afro-American as incapable of self-government. Through him\r\nand other leading men the cry of the South to the country has been \"Hands\r\noff! Leave us to solve our problem.\" To the Afro-American the South says,\r\n\"the white man must and will rule.\" There is little difference between the\r\nAntebellum South and the New South.\r\n\r\nHer white citizens are wedded to any method however revolting, any measure\r\nhowever extreme, for the subjugation of the young manhood of the race.\r\nThey have cheated him out of his ballot, deprived him of civil rights or\r\nredress therefor in the civil courts, robbed him of the fruits of his\r\nlabor, and are still murdering, burning and lynching him.\r\n\r\nThe result is a growing disregard of human life. Lynch law has spread its\r\ninsiduous influence till men in New York State, Pennsylvania and on the\r\nfree Western plains feel they can take the law in their own hands with\r\nimpunity, especially where an Afro-American is concerned. The South is\r\nbrutalized to a degree not realized by its own inhabitants, and the very\r\nfoundation of government, law and order, are imperilled.\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment has had a slight \"reaction\" though not sufficient to stop\r\nthe crusade of lawlessness and lynching. The spirit of christianity of the\r\ngreat M.E. Church was aroused to the frequent and revolting crimes against\r\na weak people, enough to pass strong condemnatory resolutions at its\r\nGeneral Conference in Omaha last May. The spirit of justice of the grand\r\nold party asserted itself sufficiently to secure a denunciation of the\r\nwrongs, and a feeble declaration of the belief in human rights in the\r\nRepublican platform at Minneapolis, June 7. Some of the great dailies and\r\nweeklies have swung into line declaring that lynch law must go. The\r\nPresident of the United States issued a proclamation that it be not\r\ntolerated in the territories over which he has jurisdiction. Governor\r\nNorthern and Chief Justice Bleckley of Georgia have proclaimed against it.\r\nThe citizens of Chattanooga, Tenn., have set a worthy example in that they\r\nnot only condemn lynch law, but her public men demanded a trial for Weems,\r\nthe accused rapist, and guarded him while the trial was in progress. The\r\ntrial only lasted ten minutes, and Weems chose to plead guilty and accept\r\ntwenty-one years sentence, than invite the certain death which awaited him\r\noutside that cordon of police if he had told the truth and shown the\r\nletters he had from the white woman in the case.\r\n\r\nCol. A.S. Colyar, of Nashville, Tenn., is so overcome with the horrible\r\nstate of affairs that he addressed the following earnest letter to the\r\n_Nashville American_.\r\n\r\n  Nothing since I have been a reading man has so impressed me with the\r\n  decay of manhood among the people of Tennessee as the dastardly\r\n  submission to the mob reign. We have reached the unprecedented low\r\n  level; the awful criminal depravity of substituting the mob for the\r\n  court and jury, of giving up the jail keys to the mob whenever they are\r\n  demanded. We do it in the largest cities and in the country towns; we do\r\n  it in midday; we do it after full, not to say formal, notice, and so\r\n  thoroughly and generally is it acquiesced in that the murderers have\r\n  discarded the formula of masks. They go into the town where everybody\r\n  knows them, sometimes under the gaze of the governor, in the presence of\r\n  the courts, in the presence of the sheriff and his deputies, in the\r\n  presence of the entire police force, take out the prisoner, take his\r\n  life, often with fiendish glee, and often with acts of cruelty and\r\n  barbarism which impress the reader with a degeneracy rapidly approaching\r\n  savage life. That the State is disgraced but faintly expresses the\r\n  humiliation which has settled upon the once proud people of Tennessee.\r\n  The State, in its majesty, through its organized life, for which the\r\n  people pay liberally, makes but one record, but one note, and that a\r\n  criminal falsehood, \"was hung by persons to the jury unknown.\" The\r\n  murder at Shelbyville is only a verification of what every intelligent\r\n  man knew would come, because with a mob a rumor is as good as a proof.\r\n\r\nThese efforts brought forth apologies and a short halt, but the lynching\r\nmania was raged again through the past three months with unabated fury.\r\n\r\nThe strong arm of the law must be brought to bear upon lynchers in severe\r\npunishment, but this cannot and will not be done unless a healthy public\r\nsentiment demands and sustains such action.\r\n\r\nThe men and women in the South who disapprove of lynching and remain\r\nsilent on the perpetration of such outrages, are particeps criminis,\r\naccomplices, accessories before and after the fact, equally guilty with\r\nthe actual lawbreakers who would not persist if they did not know that\r\nneither the law nor militia would be employed against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 SELF-HELP\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the creation of this healthier public sentiment, the Afro-American can\r\ndo for himself what no one else can do for him. The world looks on with\r\nwonder that we have conceded so much and remain law-abiding under such\r\ngreat outrage and provocation.\r\n\r\nTo Northern capital and Afro-American labor the South owes its\r\nrehabilitation. If labor is withdrawn capital will not remain. The\r\nAfro-American is thus the backbone of the South. A thorough knowledge and\r\njudicious exercise of this power in lynching localities could many times\r\neffect a bloodless revolution. The white man's dollar is his god, and to\r\nstop this will be to stop outrages in many localities.\r\n\r\nThe Afro-Americans of Memphis denounced the lynching of three of their\r\nbest citizens, and urged and waited for the authorities to act in the\r\nmatter and bring the lynchers to justice. No attempt was made to do so,\r\nand the black men left the city by thousands, bringing about great\r\nstagnation in every branch of business. Those who remained so injured the\r\nbusiness of the street car company by staying off the cars, that the\r\nsuperintendent, manager and treasurer called personally on the editor of\r\nthe _Free Speech_, asked them to urge our people to give them their\r\npatronage again. Other business men became alarmed over the situation and\r\nthe _Free Speech_ was run away that the colored people might be more\r\neasily controlled. A meeting of white citizens in June, three months after\r\nthe lynching, passed resolutions for the first time, condemning it. _But\r\nthey did not punish the lynchers._ Every one of them was known by name,\r\nbecause they had been selected to do the dirty work, by some of the very\r\ncitizens who passed these resolutions. Memphis is fast losing her black\r\npopulation, who proclaim as they go that there is no protection for the\r\nlife and property of any Afro-American citizen in Memphis who is not a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nThe Afro-American citizens of Kentucky, whose intellectual and financial\r\nimprovement has been phenomenal, have never had a separate car law until\r\nnow. Delegations and petitions poured into the Legislature against it, yet\r\nthe bill passed and the Jim Crow Car of Kentucky is a legalized\r\ninstitution. Will the great mass of Negroes continue to patronize the\r\nrailroad? A special from Covington, Ky., says:\r\n\r\nCovington, June 13.--The railroads of the State are beginning to feel very\r\nmarkedly, the effects of the separate coach bill recently passed by the\r\nLegislature. No class of people in the State have so many and so largely\r\nattended excursions as the blacks. All these have been abandoned, and\r\nregular travel is reduced to a minimum. A competent authority says the\r\nloss to the various roads will reach $1,000,000 this year.\r\n\r\nA call to a State Conference in Lexington, Ky., last June had delegates\r\nfrom every county in the State. Those delegates, the ministers, teachers,\r\nheads of secret and others orders, and the head of every family should\r\npass the word around for every member of the race in Kentucky to stay oil\r\nrailroads unless obliged to ride. If they did so, and their advice was\r\nfollowed persistently the convention would not need to petition the\r\nLegislature to repeal the law or raise money to file a suit. The railroad\r\ncorporations would be so effected they would in self-defense lobby to have\r\nthe separate car law repealed. On the other hand, as long as the railroads\r\ncan get Afro-American excursions they will always have plenty of money to\r\nfight all the suits brought against them. They will be aided in so doing\r\nby the same partisan public sentiment which passed the law. White men\r\npassed the law, and white judges and juries would pass upon the suits\r\nagainst the law, and render judgment in line with their prejudices and in\r\ndeference to the greater financial power.\r\n\r\nThe appeal to the white man's pocket has ever been more effectual than all\r\nthe appeals ever made to his conscience. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is\r\nto be gained by a further sacrifice of manhood and self-respect. By the\r\nright exercise of his power as the industrial factor of the South, the\r\nAfro-American can demand and secure his rights, the punishment of\r\nlynchers, and a fair trial for accused rapists.\r\n\r\nOf the many inhuman outrages of this present year, the only case where the\r\nproposed lynching did _not_ occur, was where the men armed themselves in\r\nJacksonville, Fla., and Paducah, Ky, and prevented it. The only times an\r\nAfro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and\r\nused it in self-defense.\r\n\r\nThe lesson this teaches and which every Afro-American should ponder well,\r\nis that a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black\r\nhome, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to\r\ngive. When the white man who is always the aggressor knows he runs as\r\ngreat risk of biting the dust every time his Afro-American victim does, he\r\nwill have greater respect for Afro-American life. The more the\r\nAfro-American yields and cringes and begs, the more he has to do so, the\r\nmore he is insulted, outraged and lynched.\r\n\r\nThe assertion has been substantiated throughout these pages that the press\r\ncontains unreliable and doctored reports of lynchings, and one of the most\r\nnecessary things for the race to do is to get these facts before the\r\npublic. The people must know before they can act, and there is no educator\r\nto compare with the press.\r\n\r\nThe Afro-American papers are the only ones which will print the truth, and\r\nthey lack means to employ agents and detectives to get at the facts. The\r\nrace must rally a mighty host to the support of their journals, and thus\r\nenable them to do much in the way of investigation.\r\n\r\nA lynching occurred at Port Jarvis, N.Y., the first week in June. A white\r\nand colored man were implicated in the assault upon a white girl. It was\r\ncharged that the white man paid the colored boy to make the assault, which\r\nhe did on the public highway in broad day time, and was lynched. This, too\r\nwas done by \"parties unknown.\" The white man in the case still lives. He\r\nwas imprisoned and promises to fight the case on trial. At the preliminary\r\nexamination, it developed that he had been a suitor of the girl's. She had\r\nrepulsed and refused him, yet had given him money, and he had sent\r\nthreatening letters demanding more.\r\n\r\nThe day before this examination she was so wrought up, she left home and\r\nwandered miles away. When found she said she did so because she was afraid\r\nof the man's testimony. Why should she be afraid of the prisoner! Why\r\nshould she yield to his demands for money if not to prevent him exposing\r\nsomething he knew! It seems explainable only on the hypothesis that a\r\n_liaison_ existed between the colored boy and the girl, and the white man\r\nknew of it. The press is singularly silent. Has it a motive? We owe it to\r\nourselves to find out.\r\n\r\nThe story comes from Larned, Kansas, Oct. 1, that a young white lady held\r\nat bay until daylight, without alarming any one in the house, \"a burly\r\nNegro\" who entered her room and bed. The \"burly Negro\" was promptly\r\nlynched without investigation or examination of inconsistant stories.\r\n\r\nA house was found burned down near Montgomery, Ala., in Monroe County,\r\nOct. 13, a few weeks ago; also the burned bodies of the owners and melted\r\npiles of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries led to the conclusion that the awful crime was not\r\nprompted by motives of robbery. The suggestion of the whites was that\r\n\"brutal lust was the incentive, and as there are nearly 200 Negroes living\r\nwithin a radius of five miles of the place the conclusion was inevitable\r\nthat some of them were the perpetrators.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this \"suggestion\" probably made by the real criminal, the mob acted\r\nupon the \"conclusion\" and arrested ten Afro-Americans, four of whom, they\r\ntell the world, confessed to the deed of murdering Richard L. Johnson and\r\noutraging his daughter, Jeanette. These four men, Berrell Jones, Moses\r\nJohnson, Jim and John Packer, none of them twenty-five years of age, upon\r\nthis conclusion, were taken from jail, hanged, shot, and burned while yet\r\nalive the night of Oct. 12. The same report says Mr. Johnson was on the\r\nbest of terms with his Negro tenants.\r\n\r\nThe race thus outraged must find out the facts of this awful hurling of\r\nmen into eternity on supposition, and give them to the indifferent and\r\napathetic country. We feel this to be a garbled report, but how can we\r\nprove it?\r\n\r\nNear Vicksburg, Miss., a murder was committed by a gang of burglars. Of\r\ncourse it must have been done by Negroes, and Negroes were arrested for\r\nit. It is believed that two men, Smith Tooley and John Adams belonged to a\r\ngang controlled by white men and, fearing exposure, on the night of July\r\n4, they were hanged in the Court House yard by those interested in\r\nsilencing them. Robberies since committed in the same vicinity have been\r\nknown to be by white men who had their faces blackened. We strongly\r\nbelieve in the innocence of these murdered men, but we have no proof. No\r\nother news goes out to the world save that which stamps us as a race of\r\ncutthroats, robbers and lustful wild beasts. So great is Southern hate and\r\nprejudice, they legally(?) hung poor little thirteen-year-old Mildrey\r\nBrown at Columbia, S.C., Oct. 7, on the circumstantial evidence that she\r\npoisoned a white infant. If her guilt had been proven unmistakably, had\r\nshe been white, Mildrey Brown would never have been hung.\r\n\r\nThe country would have been aroused and South Carolina disgraced forever\r\nfor such a crime. The Afro-American himself did not know as he should have\r\nknown as his journals should be in a position to have him know and act.\r\n\r\nNothing is more definitely settled than he must act for himself. I have\r\nshown how he may employ the boycott, emigration and the press, and I feel\r\nthat by a combination of all these agencies can be effectually stamped out\r\nlynch law, that last relic of barbarism and slavery. \"The gods help those\r\nwho help themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Southern Horrors, by Ida B.
