After a successful\r\ninvasion he made a truce with the Arabs, which admitted them to the\r\njoint possession of Armenia, Iberia and Cyprus, while by removing 12,000\r\nChristian Maronites from their native Lebanon, he gave the Arabs a\r\ncommand over Asia Minor of which they took advantage in 692 by\r\nconquering all Armenia. In 688 Justinian decisively defeated the\r\nBulgarians. Meanwhile the bitter dissensions caused in the Church by the\r\nemperor, his bloody persecution of the Manichaeans, and the rapacity\r\nwith which, through his creatures Stephanus and Theodatus, he extorted\r\nthe means of gratifying his sumptuous tastes and his mania for erecting\r\ncostly buildings, drove his subjects into rebellion. In 695 they rose\r\nunder Leontius, and, after cutting off the emperor's nose (whence his\r\nsurname), banished him to Cherson in the Crimea. Leontius, after a reign\r\nof three years, was in turn dethroned and imprisoned by Tiberius\r\nAbsimarus, who next assumed the purple. Justinian meanwhile had escaped\r\nfrom Cherson and married Theodora, sister of Busirus, khan of the\r\nKhazars. Compelled, however, by the intrigues of Tiberius, to quit his\r\nnew home, he fled to Terbelis, king of the Bulgarians. With an army of\r\n15,000 horsemen Justinian suddenly pounced upon Constantinople, slew his\r\nrivals Leontius and Tiberius, with thousands of their partisans, and\r\nonce more ascended the throne in 704. His second reign was marked by an\r\nunsuccessful war against Terbelis, by Arab victories in Asia Minor, by\r\ndevastating expeditions sent against his own cities of Ravenna and\r\nCherson, where he inflicted horrible punishment upon the disaffected\r\nnobles and refugees, and by the same cruel rapacity towards his\r\nsubjects. Conspiracies again broke out: Bardanes, surnamed Philippicus,\r\nassumed the purple, and Justinian, the last of the house of Heraclius,\r\nwas assassinated in Asia Minor, December 711.\r\n\r\n  See E. Gibbon, _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ (ed. Bury,\r\n  1896), v. 179-183; J. B. Bury, _The Later Roman Empire_ (1889), ii.\r\n  320-330, 358-367.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTIN MARTYR, one of the earliest and ablest Christian apologists, was\r\nborn about 100 at Flavia Neapolis (anc. _Sichem_), now Nablus, in\r\nPalestinian Syria (Samaria). His parents, according to his own account,\r\nwere Pagans (_Dial. c. Tryph._ 28). He describes the course of his\r\nreligious development in the introduction to the dialogue with the Jew\r\nTrypho, in which he relates how chance intercourse with an aged stranger\r\nbrought him to know the truth. Though this narrative is a mixture of\r\ntruth and fiction, it may be said with certainty that a thorough study\r\nof the philosophy of Peripatetics and Pythagoreans, Stoics and\r\nPlatonists, brought home to Justin the conviction that true knowledge\r\nwas not to be found in them. On the other hand, he came to look upon the\r\nOld Testament prophets as approved by their antiquity, sanctity, mystery\r\nand prophecies to be interpreters of the truth. To this, as he tells us\r\nin another place (_Apol._ ii. 12), must be added the deep impression\r\nproduced upon him by the life and death of Christ. His conversion\r\napparently took place at Ephesus; there, at any rate, he places his\r\ndecisive interview with the old man, and there he had those discussions\r\nwith Jews and converts to Judaism, the results of which he in later\r\nyears set down in his _Dialogue_. After his conversion he retained his\r\nphilosopher's cloak (Euseb., _Hist. Eccl._ iv. 11. 8), the distinctive\r\nbadge of the wandering professional teacher of philosophy, and went\r\nabout from place to place discussing the truths of Christianity in the\r\nhope of bringing educated Pagans, as he himself had been brought,\r\nthrough philosophy to Christ. In Rome he made a fairly long stay, giving\r\nlectures in a class-room of his own, though not without opposition from\r\nhis fellow-teachers. Among his opponents was the Cynic Crescentius\r\n(_Apol._ ii. 13). Eusebius (_Hist. Eccl._ iv. 16. 7-8) concludes\r\nsomewhat hastily, from the statement of Justin and his disciple Tatian\r\n(_Orat. ad Graec._ 19), that the accusation of Justin before the\r\nauthorities, which led to his death, was due to Crescentius. But we\r\nknow, from the undoubtedly genuine _Acta SS Justini et sociorum_, that\r\nJustin suffered the death of a martyr under the prefect Rusticus between\r\n163 and 167.\r\n\r\nTo form an opinion of Justin as a Christian and theologian, we must turn\r\nto his _Apology_ and to the _Dialogue_ with the Jew Trypho, for the\r\nauthenticity of all other extant works attributed to him is disputed\r\nwith good reason. The _Apology_--it is more correct to speak of one\r\n_Apology_ than of two, for the second is only a continuation of the\r\nfirst, and dependent upon it--was written in Rome about 150. In the\r\nfirst part Justin defends his fellow-believers against the charge of\r\natheism and hostility to the state. He then draws a positive\r\ndemonstration of the truth of his religion from the effects of the new\r\nfaith, and especially from the excellence of its moral teaching, and\r\nconcludes with a comparison of Christian and Pagan doctrines, in which\r\nthe latter are set down with naive confidence as the work of demons. As\r\nthe main support of his proof of the truth of Christianity appears his\r\ndetailed demonstration that the prophecies of the old dispensation,\r\nwhich are older than the Pagan poets and philosophers, have found their\r\nfulfilment in Christianity. A third part shows, from the practices of\r\ntheir religious worship, that the Christians had in truth dedicated\r\nthemselves to God. The whole closes with an appeal to the princes, with\r\na reference to the edict issued by Hadrian in favour of the Christians.\r\nIn the so-called _Second Apology_, Justin takes occasion from the trial\r\nof a Christian recently held in Rome to argue that the innocence of the\r\nChristians was proved by the very persecutions.\r\n\r\nEven as a Christian Justin always remained a philosopher. By his\r\nconscious recognition of the Greek philosophy as a preparation for the\r\ntruths of the Christian religion, he appears as the first and most\r\ndistinguished in the long list of those who have endeavoured to\r\nreconcile Christian with non-Christian culture. Christianity consists\r\nfor him in the doctrines, guaranteed by the manifestation of the Logos\r\nin the person of Christ, of God, righteousness and immortality, truths\r\nwhich have been to a certain extent foreshadowed in the monotheistic\r\nreligious philosophies. In this process the conviction of the\r\nreconciliation of the sinner with God, of the salvation of the world and\r\nthe individual through Christ, fell into the background before the\r\nvindication of supernatural truths intellectually conceived. Thus Justin\r\nmay give the impression of having rationalized Christianity, and of not\r\nhaving given it its full value as a religion of salvation. It must not,\r\nhowever, be forgotten that Justin is here speaking as the apologist of\r\nChristianity to an educated Pagan public, on whose philosophical view of\r\nlife he had to base his arguments, and from whom he could not expect an\r\nintimate comprehension of the religious position of Christians. That he\r\nhimself had a thorough comprehension of it he showed in the _Dialogue_\r\nwith the Jew Trypho. Here, where he had to deal with the Judaism that\r\nbelieved in a Messiah, he was far better able to do justice to\r\nChristianity as a revelation; and so we find that the arguments of this\r\nwork are much more completely in harmony with primitive Christian\r\ntheology than those of the _Apology_. He also displays in this work a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of the Rabbinical writings and a skilful\r\npolemical method which was surpassed by none of the later anti-Jewish\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nJustin is a most valuable authority for the life of the Christian Church\r\nin the middle of the 2nd century. While we have elsewhere no connected\r\naccount of this, Justin's _Apology_ contains a few paragraphs (61 seq.),\r\nwhich give a vivid description of the public worship of the Church and\r\nits method of celebrating the sacraments (Baptism and the Eucharist).\r\nAnd from this it is clear that though, as a theologian, Justin wished to\r\ngo his own way, as a believing Christian he was ready to make his\r\nstandpoint that of the Church and its baptismal confession of faith. His\r\nworks are also of great value for the history of the New Testament\r\nwritings. He knows of no canon of the New Testament, i.e. no fixed and\r\ninclusive collection of the apostolic writings. His sources for the\r\nteachings of Jesus are the \"Memoirs of the Apostles,\" by which are\r\nprobably to be understood the Synoptic Gospels (without the Gospel\r\naccording to St John), which, according to his account, were read along\r\nwith the prophetic writings at the public services. From his writings we\r\nderive the impression of an amiable personality, who is honestly at\r\npains to arrive at an understanding with his opponents. As a theologian,\r\nhe is of wide sympathies; as a writer, he is often diffuse and somewhat\r\ndull. There are not many traces of any particular literary influence of\r\nhis writings upon the Christian Church, and this need not surprise us.\r\nThe Church as a whole took but little interest in apologetics and\r\npolemics, nay, had at times even an instinctive feeling that in these\r\ncontroversies that which she held holy might easily suffer loss. Thus\r\nJustin's writings were not much read, and at the present time both the\r\n_Apology_ and the _Dialogue_ are preserved in but a single MS. (cod.\r\nParis, 450, A.D. 1364).\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The editions of Robert Etienne (Stephanus) (1551); H.\r\n  Sylburg (1593); F. Morel (1615); Prudentius Maranuis (1742) are\r\n  superseded by J. C. T. Otto, _Justini philosophi et martyris opera\r\n  quae feruntur omnia_ (3rd ed. 5 vols., Jena, 1876-1881). This edition\r\n  contains besides the _Apologies_ (vol. i.) and the _Dialogue_ (vol.\r\n  ii.) the following writings: _Speech to the Greeks_ (_Oratio_);\r\n  _Address to the Greeks_ (_Cohortatio_): _On the Monarchy of God_;\r\n  _Epistle to Diognetus_; _Fragments on the Resurrection and other\r\n  Fragments_; _Exposition of the True Faith_; _Epistle to Zenas and\r\n  Serenus_; _Refutation of certain Doctrines of Aristotle_; _Questions\r\n  and Answers to the Orthodox_; _Questions of Christians to Pagans_;\r\n  _Questions of Pagans to Christians_. None of these writings, not even\r\n  the _Cohortatio_, which former critics ascribed to Justin, can be\r\n  attributed to him. The authenticity of the _Dialogue_ has occasionally\r\n  been disputed, but without reason. For a handy edition of the\r\n  _Apology_ see G. Kruger, _Die Apologien Justins des Martyrers_ (3rd\r\n  ed. Tubingen, 1904). There is a good German translation with a\r\n  comprehensive commentary by H. Veil (1894).

K.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUTE, a vegetable fibre now occupying a position in the manufacturing\r\nscale inferior only to cotton and flax. The term jute appears to have\r\nbeen first used in 1746, when the captain of the \"Wake\" noted in his log\r\nthat he had sent on shore \"60 bales of gunney with all the jute rope\"\r\n(_New Eng. Dict. s.v._). In 1795 W. Roxburgh sent to the directors of\r\nthe East India Company a bale of the fibre which he described as \"the\r\njute of the natives.\" Importations of the substance had been made at\r\nearlier times under the name of _pat_, an East Indian native term by\r\nwhich the fibre continued to be spoken of in England till the early\r\nyears of the 19th century, when it was supplanted by the name it now\r\nbears. This modern name appears to be derived from _jhot_ or _jhout_\r\n(Sansk. _jhat_), the vernacular name by which the substance is known in\r\nthe Cuttack district, where the East India Company had extensive\r\nroperies when Roxburgh first used the term.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Capsules of Jute Plants. a, _Corchorus\r\ncapsularis_; b, C. _olitorius_.]\r\n\r\nThe fibre is obtained from two species of _Corchorus_ (nat. ord.\r\n_Tiliaceae_), _C. capsularis_ and _C. olitorius_, the products of both\r\nbeing so essentially alike that neither in commerce nor agriculture is\r\nany distinction made between them. These and various other species of\r\n_Corchorus_ are natives of Bengal, where they have been cultivated from\r\nvery remote times for economic purposes, although there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the cultivation did not originate in the northern parts of\r\nIndia. The two species cultivated for jute fibre are in all respects\r\nvery similar to each other, except in their fructification and the\r\nrelatively greater size attained by _C. capsularis_. They are annual\r\nplants from 5 to 10 ft. high, with a cylindrical stalk as thick as a\r\nman's finger, and hardly branching except near the top. The light-green\r\nleaves are from 4 to 5 in. long by 1(1/2) in. broad above the base, and\r\ntaper upward into a fine point; the edges are serrated; the two lower\r\nteeth are drawn out into bristle-like points. The small whitish-yellow\r\nflowers are produced in clusters of two or three opposite the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe capsules or seed-pods in the case of _C. capsularis_ are globular,\r\nrough and wrinkled, while in _C. olitorius_ they are slender, quill-like\r\ncylinders (about 2 in. long), a very marked distinction, as may be noted\r\nfrom fig. 1, in which a and b show the capsules of _C. capsularis_ and\r\n_C. olitorius_ respectively. Fig. 2 represents a flowering top of _C.\r\nolitorius_.\r\n\r\nBoth species are cultivated in India, not only on account of their\r\nfibre, but also for the sake of their leaves, which are there\r\nextensively used as a pot-herb. The use of _C. olitorius_ for the latter\r\npurpose dates from very ancient times, if it may be identified, as some\r\nsuppose, with the mallows ([Hebrew: maluah]) mentioned in Job xxx. 4;\r\nhence the name Jew's mallow. It is certain that the Greeks used this\r\nplant as a pot-herb; and by many other nations around the shores of the\r\nMediterranean this use of it was, and is still, common. Throughout\r\nBengal the name by which the plants when used as edible vegetables are\r\nrecognized is _nalita_; when on the other hand they are spoken of as\r\nfibre-producers it is generally under the name _pat_. The cultivation of\r\n_C. capsularis_ is most prevalent in central and eastern Bengal, while\r\nin the neighbourhood of Calcutta, where, however, the area under\r\ncultivation is limited, _C. olitorius_ is principally grown. The fibre\r\nknown as China jute or Tien-tsin jute is the product of another plant,\r\n_Abutilon Avicennae_, a member of the Mallow family.\r\n\r\n_Cultivation and Cropping._--Attempts have been made to grow the jute\r\nplant in America, Egypt, Africa and other places, but up to the present\r\nthe fibre has proved much inferior to that obtained from plants grown in\r\nIndia. Here the cultivation of the plant extends from the Hugli through\r\neastern and northern Bengal. The successful cultivation of the plant\r\ndemands a hot, moist climate, with a fair amount of rain. Too much rain\r\nat the beginning of the season is detrimental to the growth, while a\r\nvery dry season is disastrous. The climate of eastern and northern\r\nBengal appears to be ideal for the growth of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the fibre and the produce per acre depend in a measure on\r\nthe preparation of the soil. The ground should be ploughed about four\r\ntimes and all weeds removed. The seed is then sown broadcast as in the\r\ncase of flax. It is only within quite recent years that any attention\r\nhas been paid to the selection of the seed. The following extract from\r\n_Capital_ (Jan. 17, 1907) indicates the new interest taken in it.\r\n\r\n  \"Jute seed experiments are being continued and the report for 1906 has\r\n  been issued. The object of these experiments is, of course, to obtain\r\n  a better class of jute seed by growing plants, especially for no other\r\n  purpose than to obtain their seed. The agricultural department has\r\n  about 300 maunds (25,000 lb.) of selected seed for distribution this\r\n  year. The selling price is to be _Rs._ 10 per maund. The agricultural\r\n  department of the government of Bengal are now fully alive to the\r\n  importance of fostering the jute industry by showing conclusively that\r\n  attention to scientific agriculture will make two maunds of jute grow\r\n  where only one maund grew before. Let them go on (as they will) till\r\n  all the ryots are thoroughly indoctrinated into the new system.\"\r\n\r\nThe time of sowing extends from the middle of March to the middle of\r\nJune, while the reaping, which depends upon the time of sowing and upon\r\nthe weather, is performed from the end of June to the middle of October.\r\nThe crop is said to be ready for gathering when the flowers appear; if\r\ngathered before, the fibre is weak, while if left until the seed is\r\nripe, the fibre is stronger, but is coarser and lacks the characteristic\r\nlustre.\r\n\r\nThe fibre is separated from the stalks by a process of retting similar\r\nto that for flax and hemp. In certain districts of Bengal it is the\r\npractice to stack the crop for a few days previous to retting in order\r\nto allow the leaves to dry and to drop off the stalks. It is stated that\r\nthe colour of the fibre is darkened if the leaves are allowed to remain\r\non during the process of retting. It is also thought that the drying of\r\nthe plants before retting facilitates the separation of the fibre. Any\r\nsimple operation which improves the colour of the fibre or shortens the\r\noperation of retting is worthy of consideration. The benefits to be\r\nderived from the above process, however, cannot be great, for the\r\nbundles are usually taken direct to the pools and streams. The period\r\nnecessary for the completion of the retting process varies according to\r\nthe temperature and to the properties of the water, and may occupy from\r\ntwo days to a month. After the first few days of immersion the stalks\r\nare examined daily to test the progress of the retting. When the fibres\r\nare easily separated from the stalk, the operation is complete and the\r\nbundles should be withdrawn. The following description of the retting of\r\njute is taken from Royle's _Fibrous Plants of India_:--\r\n\r\n  \"The proper point being attained, the native operator, standing up to\r\n  his middle in water, takes as many of the sticks in his hands as he\r\n  can grasp, and removing a small portion of the bark from the ends next\r\n  the roots, and grasping them together, he strips off the whole with a\r\n  little management from end to end, without breaking either stem or\r\n  fibre. Having prepared a certain quantity into this half state, he\r\n  next proceeds to wash off: this is done by taking a large handful;\r\n  swinging it round his head he dashes it repeatedly against the surface\r\n  of the water, drawing it through towards him, so as to wash off the\r\n  impurities; then, with a dexterous throw he fans it out on the surface\r\n  of the water and carefully picks off all remaining black spots. It is\r\n  now wrung out so as to remove as much water as possible, and then hung\r\n  up on lines prepared on the spot, to dry in the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe separated fibre is then made up into bundles ready for sending to\r\none of the jute presses. The jute is carefully sorted into different\r\nqualities, and then each lot is subjected to an enormous hydraulic\r\npressure from which it emerges in the shape of the well-known bales,\r\neach weighing 400 lb.\r\n\r\nThe crop naturally depends upon the quality of the soil, and upon the\r\nattention which the fibre has received in its various stages; the yield\r\nper acre varies in different districts. Three bales per acre, or 1200\r\nlb. is termed a 100% crop, but the usual quantity obtained is about 2.6\r\nbales per acre. Sometimes the crop is stated in lakhs of 100,000 bales\r\neach. The crop in 1906 reached nearly 9,000,000 bales, and in 1907\r\nnearly 10,000,000 was reached. The following particulars were issued on\r\nthe 19th of September 1906 by Messrs. W. F.

The best qualities are of a clear whitish-yellow\r\ncolour, with a fine silky lustre, soft and smooth to the touch, and\r\nfine, long and uniform in fibre. When the fibre is intended for goods in\r\nthe natural colour it is essential that it should be of a light shade\r\nand uniform, but if intended for yarns which are to be dyed a dark\r\nshade, the colour is not so important. The cultivated plant yields a\r\nfibre with a length of from 6 to 10 ft., but in exceptional cases it has\r\nbeen known to reach 14 or 15 ft. in length. The fibre is decidedly\r\ninferior to flax and hemp in strength and tenacity; and, owing to a\r\npeculiarity in its microscopic structure, by which the walls of the\r\nseparate cells composing the fibre vary much in thickness at different\r\npoints, the single strands of fibre are of unequal strength. Recently\r\nprepared fibre is always stronger, more lustrous, softer and whiter than\r\nsuch as has been stored for some time--age and exposure rendering it\r\nbrown in colour and harsh and brittle in quality. Jute, indeed, is much\r\nmore woody in texture than either flax or hemp, a circumstance which may\r\nbe easily demonstrated by its behaviour under appropriate reagents; and\r\nto that fact is due the change in colour and character it undergoes on\r\nexposure to the air. The fibre bleaches with facility, up to a certain\r\npoint, sufficient to enable it to take brilliant and delicate shades of\r\ndye colour, but it is with great difficulty brought to a pure white by\r\nbleaching. A very striking and remarkable fact, which has much practical\r\ninterest, is its highly hygroscopic nature. While in a dry position and\r\natmosphere it may not possess more than 6% of moisture, under damp\r\nconditions it will absorb as much as 23%.\r\n\r\n  Sir G. Watt, in his _Dictionary of the Economic Products of India_,\r\n  mentions the following eleven varieties of jute fibre: Serajganji,\r\n  Narainganji, Desi, Deora, Uttariya, Deswal, Bakrabadi, Bhatial,\r\n  Karimginji, Mirganji and Jungipuri. There are several other varieties\r\n  of minor importance. The first four form the four classes into which\r\n  the commercial fibre is divided, and they are commonly known as\r\n  Serajgunge, Naraingunge, Daisee and Dowrah. Serajgunge is a soft\r\n  fibre, but it is superior in colour, which ranges from white to grey.\r\n  Naraingunge is a strong fibre, possesses good spinning qualities, and\r\n  is very suitable for good warp yarns. Its colour, which is not so high\r\n  as Serajgunge, begins with a cream shade and approaches red at the\r\n  roots. All the better class yarns are spun from these two kinds.\r\n  Daisee is similar to Serajgunge in softness, is of good quality and of\r\n  great length; its drawback is the low colour, and hence it is not so\r\n  suitable for using in natural colour. It is, however, a valuable fibre\r\n  for carpet yarns, especially for dark yarns. Dowrah is a strong, harsh\r\n  and low quality fibre, and is used principally for heavy wefts. Each\r\n  class is subdivided according to the quality and colour of the\r\n  material, and each class receives a distinctive mark called a baler's\r\n  mark. Thus, the finest fibres may be divided as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Superfine first marks.\r\n    Extra fine first marks 1st, 2nd and 3rd numbers.\r\n    Superior first marks      \"        \"       \"\r\n    Standard   \"     \"        \"        \"       \"\r\n    Good       \"     \"        \"        \"       \"\r\n    Ordinary   \"     \"        \"        \"       \"\r\n    Good second      \"        \"        \"       \"\r\n    Ordinary   \"     \"        \"        \"       \"\r\n\r\n  The lower qualities are, naturally, divided into fewer varieties.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--_Corchorus olitorius_.]\r\n\r\n  Each baler has his own marks, the fibres of which are guaranteed equal\r\n  in equality to some standard mark. It would be impossible to give a\r\n  list of the different marks, for there are hundreds, and new marks are\r\n  constantly being added. A list of all the principal marks is issued in\r\n  book form by the Calcutta Jute Baler's association.\r\n\r\n  The relative prices of the different classes depend upon the crop,\r\n  upon the demand and upon the quality of the fibre; in 1905 the prices\r\n  of Daisee jute and First Marks were practically the same, although the\r\n  former is always considered inferior to the latter. It does not follow\r\n  that a large crop of jute will result in low prices, for the year\r\n  1906-1907 was not only a record one for crops, but also for prices. R.\r\n  F. C. grade has been as high as L40 per ton, while its lowest recorded\r\n  price is L12. Similarly the price for First Marks reached L29, 15s. in\r\n  1906 as compared with L9, 5s. per ton in 1897. The following table\r\n  shows a few well-known grades with the average prices during December\r\n  for the years 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n    +-------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n    |       Class.      |Dec. 1903.|Dec. 1904.|Dec. 1905.|Dec. 1906.|\r\n    +-------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n    |                   |  L s. d. |  L s. d. |  L s. d. |  L s. d. |\r\n    | First marks       | 12 15  0 | 16  0  0 | 19 15  0 | 27 15  0 |\r\n    | Blacks S C C      | 11  2  6 | 14  5  0 | 17 15  0 | 20 15  0 |\r\n    | Red S C C         | 12  0  0 | 14 17  6 | 18 15  0 | 23 15  0 |\r\n    | Native rejections |  8  2  6 |    --    | 14 10  0 | 15 17  6 |\r\n    | S 4 group         |    --    |    --    | 25 10  0 | 38  0  0 |\r\n    | R F block D group |    --    |    --    |    --    | 36  0  0 |\r\n    | R F circle D group| 14 10  0 | 16 15  0 | 21 10  0 |    --    |\r\n    | R F D group       | 11 15  0 | 14  2  6 | 17 12  6 | 22  0  0 |\r\n    | N B green D       | 14  5  0 |    --    | 21  0  0 | 32  0  0 |\r\n    | Heart T 4         | 14 12  6 | 17 10  0 | 22 10  0 | 34  0  0 |\r\n    | Heart T 5         | 14 12  6 | 17 10  0 | 21  0  0 | 31  0  0 |\r\n    | Daisee 2          | 12 17  6 |    --    | 18 15  0 | 25 10  0 |\r\n    | Daisee assortment | 12 10  0 | 14 17  6 | 18  5  0 |    --    |\r\n    | Mixed cuttings    |  4  5  0 |    --    | 10  0  0 | 10  0  0 |\r\n    +-------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n_Jute Manufacture._--Long before jute came to occupy a prominent place\r\namongst the textile fibres of Europe, it formed the raw material of a\r\nlarge and important industry throughout the regions of Eastern Bengal.\r\nThe Hindu population made the material up into cordage, paper and cloth,\r\nthe chief use of the latter being in the manufacture of gunny bags.\r\nIndeed, up to 1830-1840 there was little or no competition with hand\r\nlabour for this class of material. The process of weaving gunnies for\r\nbags and other coarse articles by these hand-loom weavers has been\r\ndescribed as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Seven sticks or chattee weaving-posts, called _tana para_ or warp,\r\n  are fixed upon the ground, occupying the length equal to the measure\r\n  of the piece to be woven, and a sufficient number of twine or thread\r\n  is wound on them as warp called _tana_. The warp is taken up and\r\n  removed to the weaving machine. Two pieces of wood are placed at two\r\n  ends, which are tied to the _ohari_ and _okher_ or roller; they are\r\n  made fast to the _khoti_. The _belut_ or treadle is put into the warp;\r\n  next to that is the _sarsul_; a thin piece of wood is laid upon the\r\n  warp, called _chupari_ or regulator. There is no sley used in this,\r\n  nor is a shuttle necessary; in the room of the latter a stick covered\r\n  with thread called _singa_ is thrown into the warp as woof, which is\r\n  beaten in by a piece of plank called _beyno_, and as the cloth is\r\n  woven it is wound up to the roller. Next to this is a piece of wood\r\n  called _khetone_, which is used for smoothing and regulating the woof;\r\n  a stick is fastened to the warp to keep the woof straight.\"\r\n\r\nGunny cloth is woven of numerous qualities, according to the purpose to\r\nwhich it is devoted. Some kinds are made close and dense in texture, for\r\ncarrying such seed as poppy or rape and sugar; others less close are\r\nused for rice, pulses, and seeds of like size, and coarser and opener\r\nkinds again are woven for the outer cover of packages and for the sails\r\nof country boats. There is a thin close-woven cloth made and used as\r\ngarments among the females of the aboriginal tribes near the foot of the\r\nHimalayas, and in various localities a cloth of pure jute or of jute\r\nmixed with cotton is used as a sheet to sleep on, as well as for wearing\r\npurposes. To indicate the variety of uses to which jute is applied, the\r\nfollowing quotation may be cited from the official report of Hem Chunder\r\nKerr as applying to Midnapur.\r\n\r\n  \"The articles manufactured from jute are principally (1) gunny bags;\r\n  (2) string, rope and cord; (3) _kampa_, a net-like bag for carrying\r\n  wood or hay on bullocks; (4) _chat_, a strip of stuff for tying bales\r\n  of cotton or cloth; (5) _dola_, a swing on which infants are rocked to\r\n  sleep; (6) _shika_, a kind of hanging shelf for little earthen pots,\r\n  &c.; (7) _dulina_, a floor-cloth; (8) _beera_, a small circular stand\r\n  for wooden plates used particularly in _poojahs_; (9) painter's brush\r\n  and brush for white-washing; (10) _ghunsi_, a waist-band worn next to\r\n  the skin; (11) _gochh-dari_, a hair-band worn by women; (12) _mukbar_,\r\n  a net bag used as muzzle for cattle; (13) _parchula_, false hair worn\r\n  by players; (14) _rakhi-bandhan_, a slender arm-band worn at the\r\n  Rakhi-poornima festival; and (15) _dhup_, small incense sticks burned\r\n  at _poojahs_.\"\r\n\r\nThe fibre began to receive attention in Great Britain towards the close\r\nof the 18th century, and early in the 19th century it was spun into yarn\r\nand woven into cloth in the town of Abingdon. It is claimed that this\r\nwas the first British town to manufacture the material. For years small\r\nquantities of jute were imported into Great Britain and other European\r\ncountries and into America, but it was not until the year 1832 that the\r\nfibre may be said to have made any great impression in Great Britain.\r\nThe first really practical experiments with the fibre were made in this\r\nyear in Chapelshade Works, Dundee, and these experiments proved to be\r\nthe foundation of an enormous industry. It is interesting to note that\r\nthe site of Chapelshade Works was in 1907 cleared for the erection of a\r\nlarge new technical college.\r\n\r\nIn common with practically all new industries progress was slow for a\r\ntime, but once the value of the fibre and the cloth produced from it had\r\nbecome known the development was more rapid. The pioneers of the work\r\nwere confronted with many difficulties; most people condemned the fibre\r\nand the cloth, many warps were discarded as unfit for weaving, and any\r\nattempt to mix the fibre with flax, tow or hemp was considered a form of\r\ndeception. The real cause of most of these objections was the fact that\r\nsuitable machinery and methods of treatment had not been developed for\r\npreparing yarns from this useful fibre. Warden in his _Linen Trade_\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  \"For years after its introduction the principal spinners refused to\r\n  have anything to do with jute, and cloth made of it long retained a\r\n  tainted reputation. Indeed, it was not until Mr. Rowan got the Dutch\r\n  government, about 1838, to substitute jute yarns for those made from\r\n  flax in the manufacture of the coffee bagging for their East Indian\r\n  possessions, that the jute trade in Dundee got a proper start. That\r\n  fortunate circumstance gave an impulse to the spinning of the fibre\r\n  which it never lost, and since that period its progress has been truly\r\n  astonishing.\"\r\n\r\nThe demand for this class of bagging, which is made from fine hessian\r\nyarns, is still great. These fine Rio hessian yarns form an important\r\nbranch of the Dundee trade, and in some weeks during 1906 as many as\r\n1000 bales were despatched to Brazil, besides numerous quantities to\r\nother parts of the world.\r\n\r\nFor many years Great Britain was the only European country engaged in\r\nthe manufacture of jute, the great seat being Dundee. Gradually,\r\nhowever, the trade began to extend, and now almost every European\r\ncountry is partly engaged in the trade.\r\n\r\nThe success of the mechanical method of spinning and weaving of jute in\r\nDundee and district led to the introduction of textile machinery into\r\nand around Calcutta. The first mill to be run there by power was started\r\nin 1854, while by 1872 three others had been established. In the next\r\nten years no fewer than sixteen new mills were erected and equipped with\r\nmodern machinery from Great Britain, while in 1907 there were\r\nthirty-nine mills engaged in the industry. The expansion of the Indian\r\npower trade may be gathered from the following particulars of the number\r\nof looms and spindles from 1892 to 1906. In one or two cases the number\r\nof spindles is obtained approximately by reckoning twenty spindles per\r\nloom, which is about the average for the Indian mills.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +-------------+------------+--------------+\r\n  |    Year.    |   Looms.   |   Spindles.  |\r\n  +-------------+------------+--------------+\r\n  |   1892-3    |    8,479   |   177,732    |\r\n  |   1893-4    |    9,082   |   189,144    |\r\n  |   1894-5    |    9,504   |   197,673    |\r\n  |   1895-6    |   10,071   |   212,595    |\r\n  |   1896-7    |   12,276   |   254,610    |\r\n  |   1897-8    |   12,737   |   271,363    |\r\n  |   1898-9    |   13,323   |   277,398    |\r\n  |   1899-1900 |   14,021   |   293,218    |\r\n  |   1900-01   |   15,242   |   315,264    |\r\n  |   1901-02   |   16,059   |   329,300    |\r\n  |   1902-03   |   17,091   |   350,120    |\r\n  |   1904*     |   19,901   |   398,020**  |\r\n  |   1905*     |   21,318   |   426,360**  |\r\n  |   1906*     |   26,799   |   520,980**  |\r\n  +-------------+------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n  * End of calendar year, the remainder being taken to the 31st of\r\n    March, the end of financial year.\r\n\r\n  ** Approximate number of spindles.\r\n\r\nThe Calcutta looms are engaged for the most part with a few varieties of\r\nthe commoner classes of jute fabrics, but the success in this direction\r\nhas been really remarkable. Dundee, on the other hand, turns out not\r\nonly the commoner classes of fabrics, but a very large variety of other\r\nfabrics. Amongst these may be mentioned the following: Hessian, bagging,\r\ntarpaulin, sacking, scrims, Brussels carpets, Wilton carpets, imitation\r\nBrussels, and several other types of carpets, rugs and matting, in\r\naddition to a large variety of fabrics of which jute forms a part.\r\nCalcutta has certainly taken a large part of the trade which Dundee held\r\nin its former days, but the continually increasing demands for jute\r\nfabrics for new purposes have enabled Dundee to enter new markets and so\r\nto take part in the prosperity of the trade.\r\n\r\nThe development of the trade with countries outside India from 1828 to\r\n1906 may be seen by the following figures of exports:--\r\n\r\n  Average per year from   1828     to   1832-33       11,800  cwt.\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1833-34   \"   1837-38       67,483   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1838-39   \"   1842-43      117,047   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1843-44   \"   1847-48      234,055   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1848-49   \"   1852-53      439,850   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1853-54   \"   1857-58      710,826   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1858-59   \"   1862-63      969,724   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1863-64   \"   1867-68    2,628,110   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1868-69   \"   1872-73    4,858,162   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1873-74   \"   1877-78    5,362,267   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1878-79   \"   1882-83    7,274,000   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1883-84   \"   1887-88    8,223,859   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1888-89   \"   1892-93   10,372,991   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1893-94   \"   1897-98   12,084,292   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1898-99   \"   1902-03   11,959,189   \"\r\n      \"     \"     \"       1903-04   \"   1905-06   13,693,090   \"\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table shows the extent of the trade from an agricultural,\r\nas well as from a manufacturing, point of view.

The pioneers of the\r\njute industry, who did not understand this necessity, or rather who did\r\nnot know how the woody and brittle character of the fibre could be\r\nremedied, were greatly perplexed by the difficulties they had to\r\nencounter, the fibre spinning badly into a hard, rough and hairy yarn\r\nowing to the splitting and breaking of the fibre. This peculiarity of\r\njute, coupled also with the fact that the machinery on which it was\r\nfirst spun, although quite suitable for the stronger and more elastic\r\nfibres for which it was designed, required certain modifications to suit\r\nit to the weaker jute, was the cause of many annoyances and failures in\r\nthe early days of the trade.\r\n\r\n  The first process in the manufacture of jute is termed batching. Batch\r\n  setting is the first part of this operation; it consists of selecting\r\n  the different kinds or qualities of jute for any predetermined kind of\r\n  yarn. The number of bales for a batch seldom exceeds twelve, indeed it\r\n  is generally about six, and of these there may be three, four or even\r\n  more varieties or marks. The \"streaks\"[1] or \"heads\" of jute as they\r\n  come from the bale are in a hard condition in consequence of having\r\n  been subjected to a high hydraulic pressure during baling; it is\r\n  therefore necessary to soften them before any further process is\r\n  entered. The streaks are sometimes partly softened or crushed by means\r\n  of a steam hammer during the process of opening the bale, then taken\r\n  to the \"strikers-up\" where the different varieties are selected and\r\n  hung on pins, and then taken to the jute softening machine. The more\r\n  general practice, however, is to employ what is termed a \"bale\r\n  opener,\" or \"jute crusher.\" The essential parts of one type of bale\r\n  opener are three specially shaped rollers, the peripheries of which\r\n  contain a number of small knobs. Two of these rollers are supported in\r\n  the same horizontal plane of the framework, while the third or top\r\n  roller is kept in close contact by means of weights and springs acting\r\n  on each end of the arbor. Another type of machine termed the three\r\n  pair roller jute opener is illustrated in fig. 3. The layers from the\r\n  different bales are laid upon the feed cloth which carries them up to\r\n  the rollers, between which the layers are crushed and partly\r\n  separated. The proximity of the weighted roller or rollers to the\r\n  fixed ones depends upon the thickness of material passing through the\r\n  machine. The fibre is delivered by what is called the delivery cloth,\r\n  and the batcher usually selects small streaks of about 1(1/2) lb. to 2\r\n  lb. weight each and passes them on to the attendant or feeder of the\r\n  softening machine. These small streaks are now laid as regularly as\r\n  possible upon the feed-cloth of the softening machine, a general view\r\n  of which is shown in fig. 4. The fibre passes between a series of\r\n  fluted rollers, each pair of which is kept in contact by spiral\r\n  springs as shown in the figure. The standard number of pairs is\r\n  sixty-three, but different lengths obtain. There is also a difference\r\n  in the structure of the flutes, some being straight, and others\r\n  spiral, and each pair may or may not contain the same number of\r\n  flutes. The springs allow the top rollers of each pair to rise as the\r\n  material passes through the machine. Advantage is taken of this slight\r\n  upward and downward movement of the top rollers to automatically\r\n  regulate the flow of water and oil upon the material. The apparatus\r\n  for this function is placed immediately over the 11th and 12th rollers\r\n  of the softening machine and an idea of its construction may be\r\n  gathered from fig. 5. In many cases the water and oil are applied by\r\n  less automatic, but equally effective, means. The main object is to\r\n  see that the liquids are distributed evenly while the fibre is passing\r\n  through, and to stop the supply when the machine stops or when no\r\n  fibre is passing. The uniform moistening of the fibre in this machine\r\n  facilitates the subsequent operations, indeed the introduction of this\r\n  preliminary process (originally by hand) constituted the first\r\n  important step in the practical solution of the difficulties of jute\r\n  spinning. The relative quantities of oil and water depend upon the\r\n  quality of the batch. Sometimes both whale and mineral oils are used,\r\n  but in most cases the whale oil is omitted. About 1 to 1(1/4) gallons\r\n  of oil is the usual amount given per bale of 400 lb. of jute, while\r\n  the quantity of water per bale varies from 3 to 7 gallons. The\r\n  delivery attendants remove the streaks, give them a twist to\r\n  facilitate future handling, and place them on what are termed jute\r\n  barrows. The streaks are now handed over to the cutters who cut off\r\n  the roots, and finally the material is allowed to remain for twelve to\r\n  twenty-four hours to allow the mixture of oil and water to thoroughly\r\n  spread over the fibre.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Jute Opener. (The three machines shown in this\r\n  article are made by Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd., Dundee.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Jute Softening Machine.]\r\n\r\n  When the moisture has spread sufficiently, the material is taken to\r\n  the \"breaker card,\" the first machine in the preparing department. A\r\n  certain weight of jute, termed a \"dollop,\" is laid upon the feed cloth\r\n  for each revolution of the latter. The fibre, which should be arranged\r\n  on the sheet as evenly as possible, is carried up by the feed cloth\r\n  and passes between the feed roller and the shell on to the large\r\n  cylinder. This cylinder, which has a high surface speed, carries part\r\n  of the fibre towards the workers and strippers; the surface speed of\r\n  the workers being much slower than that of the cylinder. The pins in\r\n  the two rollers oppose each other, those of the workers being\r\n  \"back-set,\" and this arrangement, combined with the relative angle of\r\n  the pins, and the difference in the surface speeds of the two rollers,\r\n  results in part of the fibre being broken and carried round by the\r\n  worker towards the stripper. This, as its name implies, strips the\r\n  fibre off the worker, and carries it round to the cylinder. The pins\r\n  of the stripper and cylinder point in the same direction, but since\r\n  the surface speed of the cylinder is much greater than the surface\r\n  speed of the stripper, it follows that the fibre is combed between the\r\n  two, and that part is carried forward by the cylinder to be reworked.\r\n  The strippers and workers are in pairs, of which there may be two or\r\n  more. After passing the last pair of workers and strippers the fibre\r\n  is carried forward towards the doffing roller, the pins of which are\r\n  back-set, and the fibre is removed from the cylinder by the doffer,\r\n  from which it passes between the drawing and pressing rollers into the\r\n  conductor, and finally between the delivery and pressing rollers into\r\n  the sliver can. It may be mentioned that more or less breaking takes\r\n  place between each pair of rollers, the pins of which are opposed, and\r\n  that combing and drawing out obtains between those rollers with pins\r\n  pointing in the same direction. The ratio of the surface speeds of the\r\n  drawing roller and the feed roller is termed the draft:--\r\n\r\n    surface speed of drawing roller\r\n    ------------------------------- = draft.\r\n     surface speed of feed roller\r\n\r\n  In this machine the draft is usually about thirteen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Improved Batching Gear.]\r\n\r\n  The sliver from the can of the breaker card may be wound into balls,\r\n  or it may be taken direct to the finisher card. In the latter method\r\n  from eight to fifteen cans are placed behind the feed rollers, and all\r\n  the slivers from these cans are united before they emerge from the\r\n  machine. The main difference between a breaker card and a finisher\r\n  card is that the latter is fitted with finer pins, that it contains\r\n  two doffing rollers, and that it usually possesses a greater number of\r\n  pairs of workers and strippers--a full circular finisher card having\r\n  four sets.\r\n\r\n  After the fibre has been thoroughly carded by the above machines, the\r\n  cans containing the sliver from the finisher card are taken to the\r\n  first drawing frame. A very common method is to let four slivers run\r\n  into one sliver at the first drawing, then two slivers from the first\r\n  drawing are run into one sliver at the second drawing frame. There are\r\n  several types of drawing frames, e.g. push-bar or slide, rotary,\r\n  spiral, ring, open-link or chain, the spiral being generally used for\r\n  the second drawing. All, however, perform the same function, viz.,\r\n  combing out the fibres and thus laying them parallel, and in addition\r\n  drawing out the sliver. The designation of the machine indicates the\r\n  particular method in which the gill pins are moved. These pins are\r\n  much finer than those of the breaker and finisher cards, consequently\r\n  the fibres are more thoroughly separated. The draft in the first\r\n  drawing varies from three to five, while that in the second drawing is\r\n  usually five to seven. It is easy to see that a certain amount of\r\n  draft, or drawing out of the sliver, is necessary, otherwise the\r\n  various doublings would cause the sliver to emerge thicker and thicker\r\n  from each machine. The doublings play a very important part in the\r\n  appearance of the ultimate rove and yarn, for the chief reason for\r\n  doubling threads or slivers is to minimize irregularities of thickness\r\n  and of colour in the material. In an ordinary case, the total\r\n  doublings in jute from the breaker card to the end of the second\r\n  drawing is ninety-six: 12 X 4 X 2 = 96; and if the slivers were made\r\n  thinner and more of them used the ultimate result would naturally be\r\n  improved.\r\n\r\n  The final preparing process is that of roving. In this operation there\r\n  is no doubling of the slivers, but each sliver passes separately\r\n  through the machine, from the can to the spindle, is drawn out to\r\n  about eight times its length, and receives a small amount of twist to\r\n  strengthen it, in order that it may be successfully wound upon the\r\n  roving bobbin by the flyer. The chief piece of mechanism in the roving\r\n  frame is the gearing known as the \"differential motion.\" It works in\r\n  conjunction with the disk and scroll, the cones, or the expanding\r\n  pulley, to impart an intermittingly variable speed to the bobbin (each\r\n  layer of the bobbin has its own particular speed which is constant for\r\n  the full traverse, but each change of direction of the builder is\r\n  accompanied by a quick change of speed to the bobbin). It is essential\r\n  that the bobbin should have such a motion, because the delivery of the\r\n  sliver and the speed of the flyer are constant for a given size of\r\n  rove, whereas the layers of rove on the bobbin increase in length as\r\n  the bobbin fills. In the jute roving frame the bobbin is termed the\r\n  \"follower,\" because its revolutions per minute are fewer than those of\r\n  the flyer. Each layer of rove increases the diameter of the material\r\n  on the bobbin shank; hence, at the beginning of each layer, the speed\r\n  of the bobbin must be increased, and kept at this increased speed for\r\n  the whole traverse from top to bottom or vice versa.\r\n\r\n    Let R = the revolutions per second of the flyer;\r\n        r = the revolutions per second of the bobbin;\r\n        d = the diameter of bobbin shaft plus the material;\r\n        L = the length of sliver delivered per second;\r\n    then (R - r) d.[pi] = L.\r\n\r\n  In the above expression R, [pi] and L are constant, therefore as d\r\n  increases the term (R - r) must decrease; this can happen only when r\r\n  is increased, that is, when the bobbin revolves quicker. It is easy to\r\n  see from the above expression that if the bobbin were the \"leader\" its\r\n  speed would have to decrease as it filled.\r\n\r\n  The builder, which receives its motion from the disk and scroll, from\r\n  the cones, or from the expanding pulley, has also an intermittingly\r\n  variable speed. It begins at a maximum speed when the bobbin is empty,\r\n  is constant for each layer, but decreases as the bobbin fills.\r\n\r\n  The rove yarn is now ready for the spinning frame, where a further\r\n  draft of about eight is given. The principles of jute spinning are\r\n  similar to those of dry spinning for flax. For very heavy jute yarns\r\n  the spinning frame is not used--the desired amount of twist being\r\n  given at the roving frame.\r\n\r\n  The count of jute yarn is based upon the weight in pounds of 14,400\r\n  yds., such length receiving the name of \"spyndle.\" The finest yarns\r\n  weigh 2(3/4) lb. to 3 lb. per spyndle, but the commonest kinds are 7\r\n  lb., 8 lb., 9 lb. and 10 lb. per spyndle. The sizes rise in pounds up\r\n  to about 20 lb., then by 2 lb. up to about 50 lb. per spyndle, with\r\n  much larger jumps above this weight. It is not uncommon to find 200\r\n  lb. to 300 lb. rove yarn, while the weight occasionally reaches 450\r\n  lb. per spyndle. The different sizes of yarn are extensively used in a\r\n  large variety of fabrics, sometimes alone, sometimes in conjunction\r\n  with other fibres, e.g. with worsted in the various kinds of carpets,\r\n  with cotton in tapestries and household cloths, with line and tow\r\n  yarns for the same fabrics and for paddings, &c., and with wool for\r\n  horse clothing. The yarns are capable of being dyed brilliant colours,\r\n  but, unfortunately, the colours are not very fast to light. The fibre\r\n  can also be prepared to imitate human hair with remarkable closeness,\r\n  and advantage of this is largely taken in making stage wigs.\r\n\r\n  For detailed information regarding jute, the cloths made from it and\r\n  the machinery used, see the following works: Watts's _Dictionary of\r\n  the Economic Products of India_; Royle's _Fibrous Plants of India_;\r\n  Sharp's _Flax, Tow and Jute Spinning_; Leggatt's _Jute Spinning_;\r\n  Woodhouse and Milne's _Jute and Linen Weaving_; and Woodhouse and\r\n  Milne's _Textile Design: Pure and Applied_.

Tales_, Prologue 676, where the Pardoner's hair is compared\r\n    with a \"strike of flax.\" The term is also used of a handful of hemp\r\n    or other fibre, and is one of the many technical applications of\r\n    \"strike\" or \"streak,\" which etymologically are cognate words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUTERBOG, or GUTERBOG, a town of Germany in the Prussian province of\r\nBrandenburg, on the Nuthe, 39 m. S.W. of Berlin, at the junction of the\r\nmain lines of railway from Berlin to Dresden and Leipzig. Pop. (1900),\r\n7407. The town is surrounded by a medieval wall, with three gateways,\r\nand contains two Protestant churches, of which that of St Nicholas (14th\r\ncentury) is remarkable for its three fine aisles. There are also a Roman\r\nCatholic church, an old town-hall and a modern school. Juterbog carries\r\non weaving and spinning both of flax and wool, and trades in the produce\r\nof those manufactures and in cattle. Vines are cultivated in the\r\nneighbourhood. Juterbog belonged in the later middle ages to the\r\narchbishopric of Magdeburg, passing to electoral Saxony in 1648, and to\r\nPrussia in 1815. It was here that a treaty over the succession to the\r\nduchy of Julich was made in March 1611 between Saxony and Brandenburg,\r\nand here in November 1644 the Swedes defeated the Imperialists. Two\r\nmiles S.W. of the town is the battlefield of Dennewitz where the\r\nPrussians defeated the French on the 6th of September 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUTES, the third of the Teutonic nations which invaded Britain in the\r\n5th century, called by Bede _Iutae_ or _Iuti_ (see BRITAIN,\r\nANGLO-SAXON). They settled in Kent and the Isle of Wight together with\r\nthe adjacent parts of Hampshire. In the latter case the national name is\r\nsaid to have survived until Bede's own time, in the New Forest indeed\r\napparently very much later. In Kent, however, it seems to have soon\r\npassed out of use, though there is good reason for believing that the\r\ninhabitants of that kingdom were of a different nationality from their\r\nneighbours (see KENT, KINGDOM OF). With regard to the origin of the\r\nJutes, Bede only says that Angulus (Angel) lay between the territories\r\nof the Saxons and the Iutae--a statement which points to their identity\r\nwith the Iuti or Jyder of later times, i.e. the inhabitants of Jutland.\r\nSome recent writers have preferred to identify the Jutes with a tribe\r\ncalled Eucii mentioned in a letter from Theodberht to Justinian (_Mon.\r\nGerm. Hist., Epist. iii._, p. 132 seq.) and settled apparently in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Franks. But these people may themselves have come\r\nfrom Jutland.\r\n\r\n  See Bede, _Hist. Eccles_, i. 15, iv. 16.     (H. M. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUTIGALPA, or JUTICALPA, the capital of the department of Jutigalpa in\r\neastern Honduras, on one of the main roads from the Bay of Fonseca to\r\nthe Atlantic coast, and on a small left-hand tributary of the river\r\nPatuca. Pop. (1905), about 18,000. Jutigalpa is the second city of\r\nHonduras, being surpassed only by Tegucigalpa. It is the administrative\r\ncentre of a mountainous region rich in minerals, though mining is\r\nrendered difficult by the lack of communications and the unsettled\r\ncondition of the country. The majority of the inhabitants are Indians or\r\nhalf-castes, engaged in the cultivation of coffee, bananas, tobacco,\r\nsugar or cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUTLAND (Danish _Jylland_), though embracing several islands as well as\r\na peninsula, may be said to belong to the continental portion of the\r\nkingdom of Denmark. The peninsula (Chersonese or Cimbric peninsula of\r\nancient geography) extends northward, from a line between Lubeck and the\r\nmouth of the Elbe, for 270 m. to the promontory of the Skaw (Skagen),\r\nthus preventing a natural communication directly east and west between\r\nthe Baltic and North Seas. The northern portion only is Danish, and\r\nbears the name Jutland. The southern is German, belonging to\r\nSchleswig-Holstein. The peninsula is almost at its narrowest (36 m.) at\r\nthe frontier, but Jutland has an extreme breadth of 110 m. and the\r\nextent from the south-western point (near Ribe) to the Skaw is 180 m.\r\nJutland embraces nine _amter_ (counties), namely, Hjorring, Thisted,\r\nAalborg, Ringkjobing, Viborg, Randers, Aarhus, Vejle and Ribe. The main\r\nwatershed of the peninsula lies towards the east coast; therefore such\r\nelevated ground as exists is found on the east, while the western slope\r\nis gentle and consists of a low sandy plain of slight undulation. The\r\nNorth Sea coast (western) and Skagerrack coast (north-western) consist\r\nmainly of a sweeping line of dunes with wide lagoons behind them. In the\r\nsouth the northernmost of the North Frisian Islands (Fano) is Danish.\r\nTowards the north a narrow mouth gives entry to the Limfjord, or\r\nLiimfjord, which, wide and ramifying among islands to the west, narrows\r\nto the east and pierces through to the Cattegat, thus isolating the\r\ncounties of Hjorring and Thisted (known together as Vendsyssel). It is,\r\nhowever, bridged at Aalborg, and its depth rarely exceeds 12 ft. The\r\nseaward banks of the lagoons are frequently broken in storms, and the\r\nnarrow channels through them are constantly shifting. The east coast is\r\nslightly bolder than the west, and indented with true estuaries and\r\nbays. From the south-east the chain of islands forming insular Denmark\r\nextends towards Sweden, the strait between Jutland and Funen having the\r\nname of the Little Belt. The low and dangerous coasts, off which the\r\nseas are generally very shallow, are efficiently served by a series of\r\nlifeboat stations. The western coast region is well compared with the\r\nLandes of Gascony. The interior is low. The Varde, Omme, Skjerne, Stor\r\nand Karup, sluggish and tortuous streams draining into the western\r\nlagoons, rise in and flow through marshes, while the eastern Limfjord is\r\nflanked by the swamps known as Vildmose. The only considerable river is\r\nthe Gudenaa, flowing from S.W. into the Randersfjord (Cattegat), and\r\nrising among the picturesque lakes of the county of Aarhus, where the\r\nprincipal elevated ground in the peninsula is found in the Himmelbjerg\r\nand adjacent hills (exceeding 500 ft.). The German portion of the\r\npeninsula is generally similar to that of western Jutland, the main\r\ndifference lying in the occurrence of islands (the North Frisian) off\r\nthe west coast in place of sand-bars and lagoons. Erratic blocks are of\r\nfrequent occurrence in south Jutland. (For geology, and the general\r\nconsideration of Jutland in connexion with the whole kingdom, see\r\nDENMARK.)\r\n\r\nAlthough in ancient times well wooded, the greater portion of the\r\ninterior of Jutland consisted for centuries of barren drift-sand, which\r\ngrew nothing but heather; but since 1866, chiefly through the\r\ninstrumentality of the patriotic Heath association, assisted by annual\r\ncontributions from the state, a very large proportion of this region has\r\nbeen more or less reclaimed for cultivation. The means adopted are: (i.)\r\nthe plantation of trees; (ii.) the making of irrigation canals and\r\nirrigating meadows; (iii.) exploring for, extracting and transporting\r\nloam, a process aided by the construction of short light railways; and\r\n(iv.), since 1889, the experimental cultivation of fenny districts. The\r\nactivity of the association takes the form partly of giving gratuitous\r\nadvice, partly of experimental attempts, and partly of model works for\r\nimitation. The state also makes annual grants directly to owners who are\r\nwilling to place their plantations under state supervision, for the sale\r\nof plants at half price to the poorer peasantry, for making protective\r\nor sheltering plantations, and for free transport of marl or loam. The\r\nspecies of timber almost exclusively planted are the red fir (_Picea\r\nexcelsa_) and the mountain pine (_Pinus montana_). This admirable work\r\nquickly caused the population to increase at a more rapid rate in the\r\ndistricts where it was practised than in any other part of the Danish\r\nkingdom. The counties of Viborg, Ringkjobing and Ribe cover the\r\nprincipal heath district.\r\n\r\nJutland is well served by railways. Two lines cross the frontier from\r\nGermany on the east and west respectively and run northward near the\r\ncoasts. The eastern touches the ports of Kolding, Fredericia, Vejle,\r\nHorsens, Aarhus, Randers, Aalborg on Limfjord, Frederikshavn and Skagen.\r\nOn the west the only port of first importance is Esbjerg. The line runs\r\npast Skjerne, Ringkjobing, Vemb and Holstebro to Thisted. Both throw off\r\nmany branches and are connected by lines east and west between Kolding\r\nand Esbjerg, Skanderborg and Skjerne, Langaa and Struer on Limfjord via\r\nViborg. Of purely inland towns only Viborg in the midland and Hjorring\r\nin the extreme north are of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUTURNA (older form Diuturna, the lasting), an old Latin divinity, a\r\npersonification of the never-failing springs. Her original home was on\r\nthe river Numicius near Lavinium, where there was a spring called after\r\nher, supposed to possess healing qualities (whence the old Roman\r\nderivation from _juvare_, to help). Her worship was early transferred to\r\nRome, localized by the Lacus Juturnae near the temple of Vesta, at which\r\nCastor and Pollux, after announcing the victory of lake Regillus, were\r\nsaid to have washed the sweat from their horses. At the end of the First\r\nPunic War Lutatius Catulus erected a temple in her honour on the Campus\r\nMartius, subsequently restored by Augustus. Juturna was associated with\r\ntwo festivals: the Juturnalia on the 11th of January, probably a\r\ndedication festival of a temple built by Augustus, and celebrated by the\r\ncollege of the _fontani_, workmen employed in the construction and\r\nmaintenance of aqueducts and fountains; and the Volcanalia on the 23rd\r\nof August, at which sacrifice was offered to Volcanus, the Nymphs and\r\nJuturna, as protectors against outbreaks of fire. In Virgil, Juturna\r\nappears as the sister of Turnus (probably owing to the partial\r\nsimilarity of the names), on whom Jupiter, to console her for the loss\r\nof her chastity, bestowed immortality and the control of all the lakes\r\nand rivers of Latium. For the statement that she was the wife of Janus\r\nand mother of Fontus (or Fons), the god of fountains, Arnobius (_Adv.\r\ngentes_ iii. 29) is alone responsible.\r\n\r\n  See Virgil, _Aeneid_, xii. 139 and Servius _ad loc._; Ovid, _Fasti_,\r\n  ii. 583-616; Valerius Maximus, i. 8. 1; L. Deubner, \"Juturna und die\r\n  Ausgrabungen auf dem romischen Forum,\" in _Neue Jahrb. f. das\r\n  klassische Altertum_ (1902), p. 370.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUVENAL (DECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS) (c. 60-140), Roman poet and satirist,\r\nwas born at Aquinum. Brief accounts of his life, varying considerably in\r\ndetails, are prefixed to different MSS. of the works. But their common\r\noriginal cannot be traced to any competent authority, and some of their\r\nstatements are intrinsically improbable. According to the version which\r\nappears to be the earliest:--\r\n\r\n  \"Juvenal was the son or ward of a wealthy freedman; he practised\r\n  declamation till middle age, not as a professional teacher, but as an\r\n  amateur, and made his first essay in satire by writing the lines on\r\n  Paris, the actor and favourite of Domitian, now found in the seventh\r\n  satire (lines 90 seq.). Encouraged by their success, he devoted\r\n  himself diligently to this kind of composition, but refrained for a\r\n  long time from either publicly reciting or publishing his verses. When\r\n  at last he did come before the public, his recitations were attended\r\n  by great crowds and received with the utmost favour. But the lines\r\n  originally written on Paris, having been inserted in one of his new\r\n  satires, excited the jealous anger of an actor of the time, who was a\r\n  favourite of the emperor, and procured the poet's banishment under the\r\n  form of a military appointment to the extremity of Egypt. Being then\r\n  eighty years of age, he died shortly afterwards of grief and\r\n  vexation.\"\r\n\r\nSome of these statements are so much in consonance with the indirect\r\nevidence afforded by the satires that they may be a series of\r\nconjectures based upon them. The rare passages in which the poet speaks\r\nof his own position, as in satires xi. and xiii., indicate that he was\r\nin comfortable but moderate circumstances. We should infer also that he\r\nwas not dependent on any professional occupation, and that he was\r\nseparated in social station, and probably too by tastes and manners,\r\nfrom the higher class to which Tacitus and Pliny belonged, as he was by\r\ncharacter from the new men who rose to wealth by servility under the\r\nempire. Juvenal is no organ of the pride and dignity, still less of the\r\nurbanity, of the cultivated representatives of the great families of the\r\nrepublic. He is the champion of the more sober virtues and ideas, and\r\nperhaps the organ of the rancours and detraction, of an educated but\r\ndepressed and embittered middle class. He lets us know that he has no\r\nleanings to philosophy (xiii. 121) and pours contempt on the serious\r\nepic writing of the day (i. 162). The statement that he was a trained\r\nand practised declaimer is confirmed both by his own words (i. 16) and\r\nby the rhetorical mould in which his thoughts and illustrations are\r\ncast. The allusions which fix the dates when his satires first appeared,\r\nand the large experience of life which they imply, agree with the\r\nstatement that he did not come before the world as a professed satirist\r\ntill after middle age.\r\n\r\nThe statement that he continued to write satires long before he gave\r\nthem to the world accords well with the nature of their contents and the\r\nelaborate character of their composition, and might almost be inferred\r\nfrom the emphatic but yet guarded statement of Quintilian in his short\r\nsummary of Roman literature. After speaking of the merits of Lucilius,\r\nHorace and Persius as satirists, he adds, \"There are, too, in our own\r\nday, distinguished writers of satire whose names will be heard of\r\nhereafter\" (_Inst. Or._ x. 1, 94). There is no Roman writer of satire\r\nwho could be mentioned along with those others by so judicious a critic,\r\nexcept Juvenal. The motive which a writer of satire must have had for\r\nsecrecy under Domitian is sufficiently obvious; and the necessity of\r\nconcealment and self-suppression thus imposed upon the writer may have\r\npermanently affected his whole manner of composition.\r\n\r\nSo far the original of these lives follows a not improbable tradition.\r\nBut when we come to the story of the poet's exile the case is otherwise.\r\nThe undoubted reference to Juvenal in Sidonius Apollinaris as the victim\r\nof the rage of an actor only proves that the original story from which\r\nall the varying versions of the lives are derived was generally believed\r\nbefore the middle of the 5th century of our era. If Juvenal was banished\r\nat the age of eighty, the author of his banishment could not have been\r\nthe \"enraged actor\" in reference to whom the original lines were\r\nwritten, as Paris was put to death in 83, and Juvenal was certainly\r\nwriting satires long after 100. The satire in which the lines now appear\r\nwas probably first published soon after the accession of Hadrian, when\r\nJuvenal was not an octogenarian but in the maturity of his powers. The\r\ncause of the poet's banishment at that advanced age could not therefore\r\nhave been either the original composition or the first publication of\r\nthe lines.\r\n\r\nAn expression in xv. 45 is quoted as a proof that Juvenal had visited\r\nEgypt. He may have done so as an exile or in a military command; but it\r\nseems hardly consistent with the importance which the emperors attached\r\nto the security of Egypt, or with the concern which they took in the\r\ninterests of the army, that these conditions were combined at an age so\r\nunfit for military employment. If any conjecture is warrantable on so\r\nobscure a subject, it is more likely that this temporary disgrace should\r\nhave been inflicted on the poet by Domitian. Among the many victims of\r\nJuvenal's satire it is only against him and against one of the vilest\r\ninstruments of his court, the Egyptian Crispinus, that the poet seems to\r\nbe animated by personal hatred. A sense of wrong suffered at their hands\r\nmay perhaps have mingled with the detestation which he felt towards them\r\non public grounds. But if he was banished under Domitian, it must have\r\nbeen either before or after 93, at which time, as we learn from an\r\nepigram of Martial, Juvenal was in Rome.\r\n\r\nMore ancient evidence is supplied by an inscription found at Aquinum,\r\nrecording, so far as it has been deciphered, the dedication of an altar\r\nto Ceres by a Iunius Iuvenalis, tribune of the first cohort of\r\nDalmatians, _duumvir quinquennalis_, and _flamen Divi Vespasiani_, a\r\nprovincial magistrate whose functions corresponded to those of the\r\ncensor at Rome. This Juvenalis may have been the poet, but he may\r\nequally well have been a relation. The evidence of the satires does not\r\npoint to a prolonged absence from the metropolis. They are the product\r\nof immediate and intimate familiarity with the life of the great city.\r\nAn epigram of Martial, written at the time when Juvenal was most\r\nvigorously employed in their composition, speaks of him as settled in\r\nRome. He himself hints (iii. 318) that he maintained his connexion with\r\nAquinum, and that he had some special interest in the worship of the\r\n\"Helvinian Ceres.\" Nor is the tribute to the national religion implied\r\nby the dedication of the altar to Ceres inconsistent with the beliefs\r\nand feelings expressed in the satires. While the fables of mythology are\r\noften treated contemptuously or humorously by him, other passages in the\r\nsatires clearly imply a conformity to, and even a respect for, the\r\nobservances of the national religion. The evidence as to the military\r\npost filled by Juvenal is curious, when taken in connexion with the\r\nconfused tradition of his exile in a position of military importance.\r\nBut it cannot be said that the satires bear traces of military\r\nexperience; the life described in them is rather such as would present\r\nitself to the eyes of a civilian.\r\n\r\nThe only other contemporary evidence which affords a glimpse of\r\nJuvenal's actual life is contained in three epigrams of Martial. Two of\r\nthese (vii. 24 and 91) were written in the time of Domitian, the third\r\n(xii. 18) early in the reign of Trajan, after Martial had retired to his\r\nnative Bilbilis. The first attests the strong regard which Martial felt\r\nfor him; but the subject of the epigram seems to hint that Juvenal was\r\nnot an easy person to get on with. In the second, addressed to Juvenal\r\nhimself, the epithet _facundus_ is applied to him, equally applicable to\r\nhis \"eloquence\" as satirist or rhetorician. In the last Martial imagines\r\nhis friend wandering about discontentedly through the crowded streets of\r\nRome, and undergoing all the discomforts incident to attendance on the\r\nlevees of the great. Two lines in the poem suggest that the satirist,\r\nwho inveighed with just severity against the worst corruptions of Roman\r\nmorals, was not too rigid a censor of the morals of his friend. Indeed,\r\nhis intimacy with Martial is a ground for not attributing to him\r\nexceptional strictness of life.\r\n\r\nThe additional information as to the poet's life and circumstances\r\nderivable from the satires themselves is not important. He had enjoyed\r\nthe training which all educated men received in his day (i. 15); he\r\nspeaks of his farm in the territory of Tibur (xi. 65), which furnished a\r\nyoung kid and mountain asparagus for a homely dinner to which he invites\r\na friend during the festival of the Megalesia. From the satire in which\r\nthis invitation is contained we are able to form an idea of the style in\r\nwhich he habitually lived, and to think of him as enjoying a hale and\r\nvigorous age (203), and also as a kindly master of a household (159\r\nseq.). The negative evidence afforded in the account of his\r\nestablishment suggests the inference that, like Lucilius and Horace,\r\nJuvenal had no personal experience of either the cares or the softening\r\ninfluence of family life. A comparison of this poem with the invitation\r\nof Horace to Torquatus (_Ep._ i. 5) brings out strongly the differences\r\nnot in urbanity only but in kindly feeling between the two satirists.\r\nGaston Boissier has drawn from the indications afforded of the career\r\nand character of the persons to whom the satires are addressed most\r\nunfavourable conclusions as to the social circumstances and associations\r\nof Juvenal. If we believe that these were all real people, with whom\r\nJuvenal lived in intimacy, we should conclude that he was most\r\nunfortunate in his associates, and that his own relations to them were\r\nmarked rather by outspoken frankness than civility. But they seem to be\r\nmore \"nominis umbrae\" than real men; they serve the purpose of enabling\r\nthe satirist to aim his blows at one particular object instead of\r\ndeclaiming at large. They have none of the individuality and traits of\r\npersonal character discernible in the persons addressed by Horace in his\r\n_Satires_ and _Epistles_. It is noticeable that, while Juvenal writes of\r\nthe poets and men of letters of a somewhat earlier time as if they were\r\nstill living, he makes no reference to his friend Martial or the younger\r\nPliny and Tacitus, who wrote their works during the years of his own\r\nliterary activity. It is equally noticeable that Juvenal's name does not\r\nappear in Pliny's letters.\r\n\r\nThe times at which the satires were given to the world do not in all\r\ncases coincide with those at which they were written and to which they\r\nimmediately refer. Thus the manners and personages of the age of\r\nDomitian often supply the material of satiric representation, and are\r\nspoken of as if they belonged to the actual life of the present,[1]\r\nwhile allusions even in the earliest show that, as a finished literary\r\ncomposition, it belongs to the age of Trajan. The most probable\r\nexplanation of these discrepancies is that in their present form the\r\nsatires are the work of the last thirty years of the poet's life, while\r\nthe first nine at least may have preserved with little change passages\r\nwritten during his earlier manhood. The combination of the impressions,\r\nand, perhaps of the actual compositions, of different periods also\r\nexplains a certain want of unity and continuity found in some of them.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt that the sixteen satires which we possess\r\nwere given to the world in the order in which we find them, and that\r\nthey were divided, as they are referred to in the ancient grammarians,\r\ninto five books. Book I., embracing the first five satires, was written\r\nin the freshest vigour of the author's powers, and is animated with the\r\nstrongest hatred of Domitian. The publication of this book belongs to\r\nthe early years of Trajan. The mention of the exile of Marius (49) shows\r\nthat it was not published before 100. In the second satire, the lines 29\r\nseq.,\r\n\r\n  \"Qualis erat nuper tragico pollutus adulter\r\n   Concubitu,\"\r\n\r\nshow that the memory of one of the foulest scandals of the reign of\r\nDomitian was still fresh in the minds of men. The third satire, imitated\r\nby Samuel Johnson in his _London_, presents such a picture as Rome may\r\nhave offered to the satirist at any time in the 1st century of our era;\r\nbut it was under the worst emperors, Nero and Domitian, that the arts of\r\nflatterers and foreign adventurers were most successful, and that such\r\nscenes of violence as that described at 277 seq. were most likely to\r\noccur;[2] while the mention of Veiento (185) as still enjoying influence\r\nis a distinct reference to the court of Domitian. The fourth, which\r\nalone has any political significance, and reflects on the emperor as a\r\nfrivolous trifler rather than as a monster of lust and cruelty, is the\r\nreproduction of a real or imaginary scene from the reign of Domitian,\r\nand is animated by the profoundest scorn and loathing both of the tyrant\r\nhimself and of the worst instruments of his tyranny. The fifth is a\r\nsocial picture of the degradation to which poor guests were exposed at\r\nthe banquets of the rich, but many of the epigrams of Martial and the\r\nmore sober evidence of one of Pliny's letters show that the picture\r\npainted by Juvenal, though perhaps exaggerated in colouring, was drawn\r\nfrom a state of society prevalent during and immediately subsequent to\r\nthe times of Domitian.[3] Book II. consists of the most elaborate of the\r\nsatires, by many critics regarded as the poet's masterpiece, the famous\r\nsixth satire, directed against the whole female sex, which shares with\r\nDomitian and his creatures the most cherished place in the poet's\r\nantipathies. It shows certainly no diminution of vigour either in its\r\nrepresentation or its invective. The time at which this satire was\r\ncomposed cannot be fixed with certainty, but some allusions render it\r\nhighly probable that it was given to the world in the later years of\r\nTrajan, and before the accession of Hadrian. The date of the publication\r\nof Book III., containing the seventh, eighth and ninth satires, seems to\r\nbe fixed by its opening line to the first years after the accession of\r\nHadrian. In the eighth satire another reference is made (120) to the\r\nmisgovernment of Marius in Africa as a recent event, and at line 51\r\nthere may be an allusion to the Eastern wars that occupied the last\r\nyears of Trajan's reign. The ninth has no allusion to determine its\r\ndate, but it is written with the same outspoken freedom as the second\r\nand the sixth, and belongs to the period when the poet's power was most\r\nvigorous, and his exposure of vice most uncompromising. In Book IV.,\r\ncomprising the famous tenth, the eleventh and the twelfth satires, the\r\nauthor appears more as a moralist than as a pure satirist. In the tenth,\r\nthe theme of the \"vanity of human wishes\" is illustrated by great\r\nhistoric instances, rather than by pictures of the men and manners of\r\nthe age; and, though the declamatory vigour and power of expression in\r\nit are occasionally as great as in the earlier satires, and although\r\ntouches of Juvenal's saturnine humour, and especially of his misogyny,\r\nappear in all the satires of this book, yet their general tone shows\r\nthat the white heat of his indignation is abated; and the lines of the\r\neleventh, already referred to (201 seq.),\r\n\r\n        \"Spectent juvenes quos clamor et audax\r\n  Sponsio, quos cultae decet assedisse puellae:\r\n  Nostra bibat vernum contrada cuticula solem,\"\r\n\r\nleave no doubt that he was well advanced in years when they were\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nTwo important dates are found in Book V., comprising satires xiii.-xvi.\r\nAt xiii. 16 Juvenal speaks of his friend Calvinus as now past sixty\r\nyears of age, having been born in the consulship of Fonteius. Now L.\r\nFonteius Capito was consul in 67. Again at xv. 27 an event is said to\r\nhave happened in Egypt \"nuper consule Iunco.\" There was a L. Aemilius\r\nIuncus consul _suffectus_ in 127. The fifth book must therefore have\r\nbeen published some time after this date. More than the fourth, this\r\nbook bears the marks of age, both in the milder tone of the sentiments\r\nexpressed, and in the feebler power of composition exhibited. The last\r\nsatire is now imperfect, and the authenticity both of this and of the\r\nfifteenth has been questioned, though on insufficient grounds.\r\n\r\nThus the satires were published at different intervals, and for the most\r\npart composed between 100 and 130, but the most powerful in feeling and\r\nvivid in conception among them deal with the experience and impressions\r\nof the reign of Domitian, occasionally recall the memories or traditions\r\nof the times of Nero and Claudius, and reproduce at least one startling\r\npage from the annals of Tiberius.[4] The same overmastering feeling\r\nwhich constrained Tacitus (_Agric._ 2, 3), when the time of long\r\nendurance and silence was over, to recall the \"memory of the former\r\noppression,\" acted upon Juvenal. There is no evidence that these two\r\ngreat writers, who lived and wrote at the same time, who were animated\r\nby the same hatred of the tyrant under whom the best years of their\r\nmanhood were spent, and who both felt most deeply the degradation of\r\ntheir times, were even known to one another. Tacitus belonged to the\r\nhighest official and senatorial class, Juvenal apparently to the middle\r\nclass and to that of the struggling men of letters; and this difference\r\nin position had much influence in determining the different bent of\r\ntheir genius, and in forming one to be a great national historian, the\r\nother to be a great social satirist. If the view of the satirist is\r\nowing to this circumstance more limited in some directions, and his\r\ntaste and temper less conformable to the best ancient standards of\r\npropriety, he is also saved by it from prejudices to which the\r\ntraditions of his class exposed the historian. But both writers are\r\nthoroughly national in sentiment, thoroughly masculine in tone. No\r\nancient authors express so strong a hatred of evil. The peculiar\r\ngreatness and value of both Juvenal and Tacitus is that they did not\r\nshut their eyes to the evil through which they had lived, but deeply\r\nresented it--the one with a vehement and burning passion, like the\r\n\"saeva indignatio\" of Swift, the other with perhaps even deeper but more\r\nrestrained emotions of mingled scorn and sorrow, like the scorn and\r\nsorrow of Milton when \"fallen on evil days and evil tongues.\" In one\r\nrespect there is a difference. For Tacitus the prospect is not wholly\r\ncheerless, the detested tyranny was at an end, and its effects might\r\ndisappear with a more beneficent rule. But the gloom of Juvenal's\r\npessimism is unlighted by hope.\r\n\r\nA. C. Swinburne has suggested that the secret of Juvenal's concentrated\r\npower consisted in this, that he knew what he hated, and that what he\r\ndid hate was despotism and democracy. But it would be hardly true to say\r\nthat the animating motive of his satire was political. It is true that\r\nhe finds the most typical examples of lust, cruelty, levity and weakness\r\nin the emperors and their wives--in Domitian, Otho, Nero, Claudius and\r\nMessalina. It is true also that he shares in the traditional idolatry of\r\nBrutus, that he strikes at Augustus in his mention of the \"three\r\ndisciples of Sulla,\" and that he has no word of recognition for what\r\neven Tacitus acknowledges as the beneficent rule of Trajan. So too his\r\nscorn for the Roman populace of his time, who cared only for their dole\r\nof bread and the public games, is unqualified. But it is only in\r\nconnexion with its indirect effects that he seems to think of despotism;\r\nand he has no thought of democracy at all. It is not for the loss of\r\nliberty and of the senatorian rule that he chafes, but for the loss of\r\nthe old national manliness and self-respect. This feeling explains his\r\ndetestation of foreign manners and superstitions, his loathing not only\r\nof inhuman crimes and cruelties but even of the lesser derelictions from\r\nself-respect, his scorn of luxury and of art as ministering to luxury,\r\nhis mockery of the poetry and of the stale and dilettante culture of his\r\ntime, and perhaps, too, his indifference to the schools of philosophy\r\nand his readiness to identify all the professors of stoicism with the\r\nreserved and close-cropped puritans, who concealed the worst vices under\r\nan outward appearance of austerity. The great fault of his character, as\r\nit appears in his writings, is that he too exclusively indulged this\r\nmood. It is much more difficult to find what he loved and admired than\r\nwhat he hated. But it is characteristic of his strong nature that, where\r\nhe does betray any sign of human sympathy or tenderness, it is for those\r\nwho by their weakness and position are dependent on others for their\r\nprotection--as for \"the peasant boy with the little dog, his\r\nplayfellow,\"[5] or for \"the home-sick lad from the Sabine highlands, who\r\nsighs for his mother whom he has not seen for a long time, and for the\r\nlittle hut and the familiar kids.\"[6]\r\n\r\nIf Juvenal is to be ranked as a great moralist, it is not for his\r\ngreatness and consistency as a thinker on moral questions. In the\r\nrhetorical exaggeration of the famous tenth satire, for instance, the\r\nhighest energies of patriotism--the gallant and desperate defence of\r\ngreat causes, by sword or speech--are quoted as mere examples of\r\ndisappointed ambition; and, in the indiscriminate condemnation of the\r\narts by which men sought to gain a livelihood, he leaves no room for the\r\nlegitimate pursuits of industry. His services to morals do not consist\r\nin any positive contributions to the notions of active duty, but in the\r\nstrength with which he has realized and expressed the restraining\r\ninfluence of the old Roman and Italian ideal of character, and also of\r\nthat religious conscience which was becoming a new power in the world.\r\nThough he disclaims any debt to philosophy (xiii. 121), yet he really\r\nowes more to the \"Stoica dogmata,\" then prevalent, than he is aware of.\r\nBut his highest and rarest literary quality is his power of painting\r\ncharacters, scenes, incidents and actions, whether from past history or\r\nfrom contemporary life. In this power, which is also the great power of\r\nTacitus, he has few equals and perhaps no superior among ancient\r\nwriters. The difference between Tacitus and Juvenal in power of\r\nrepresentation is that the prose historian is more of an imaginative\r\npoet, the satirist more of a realist and a grotesque humorist. Juvenal\r\ncan paint great historical pictures in all their detail--as in the\r\nfamous representation of the fall of Sejanus; he can describe a\r\ncharacter elaborately or hit it off with a single stroke. The picture\r\ndrawn may be a caricature, or a misrepresentation of the fact--as that\r\nof the father of Demosthenes, \"blear-eyed with the soot of the glowing\r\nmass,\" &c.--but it is, with rare exceptions, realistically conceived,\r\nand it is brought before us with the vivid touches of a Defoe or a\r\nSwift, or of the great pictorial satirist of the 18th century, Hogarth.\r\nYet even in this, his most characteristic talent, his proneness to\r\nexaggeration, the attraction which coarse and repulsive images have for\r\nhis mind, and the tendency to sacrifice general effect to minuteness of\r\ndetail not infrequently mar his best effects.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is often felt of distinguishing between a powerful\r\nrhetorician and a genuine poet, and it is felt particularly in the case\r\nof Juvenal. He himself knew and has well described (vii. 53 seq.) the\r\nconditions under which a great poet could flourish; and he felt that his\r\nown age was incapable of producing one. He has little sense of beauty\r\neither in human life or nature. Whenever such sense is evoked it is only\r\nas a momentary relief to his prevailing sense of the hideousness of\r\ncontemporary life, or in protest against what he regarded as the\r\nenervating influences of art. Even his references to the great poets of\r\nthe past indicate rather a _blase_ sense of indifference and weariness\r\nthan a fresh enjoyment of them. Yet his power of touching the springs of\r\ntragic awe and horror is a genuine poetical gift, of the same kind as\r\nthat which is displayed by some of the early English dramatists. But he\r\nis, on the whole, more essentially a great rhetorician than a great\r\npoet. His training, the practical bent of his understanding, his strong\r\nbut morose character, the circumstances of his time, and the materials\r\navailable for his art, all fitted him to rebuke his own age and all\r\nafter-times in the tones of a powerful preacher, rather than charm them\r\nwith the art of an accomplished poet. The composition of his various\r\nsatires shows no negligence, but rather excess of elaboration; but it\r\nproduces the impression of mechanical contrivance rather than of organic\r\ngrowth. His movement is sustained and powerful, but there is no rise and\r\nfall in it. The verse is most carefully constructed, and is also most\r\neffective, but it is so with the rhetorical effectiveness of Lucan, not\r\nwith the musical charm of Virgil. The diction is full, even to excess,\r\nof meaning, point and emphasis. Few writers have added so much to the\r\ncurrency of quotation. But his style altogether wants the charm of ease\r\nand simplicity. It wearies by the constant strain after effect, its\r\nmock-heroics and allusive periphrasis, and excites distrust by its want\r\nof moderation.\r\n\r\nOn the whole no one of the ten or twelve really great writers of ancient\r\nRome leaves on the mind so mixed an impression, both as a writer and as\r\na man, as Juvenal. He has little, if anything at all, of the high\r\nimaginative mood--the mood of reverence and noble admiration--which made\r\nEnnius, Lucretius and Virgil the truest poetical representatives of the\r\ngenius of Rome. He has nothing of the wide humanity of Cicero, of the\r\nurbanity of Horace, of the ease and grace of Catullus. Yet he represents\r\nanother mood of ancient Rome, the mood natural to her before she was\r\nhumanized by the lessons of Greek art and thought. If we could imagine\r\nthe elder Cato living under Domitian, cut off from all share in public\r\nlife, and finding no outlet for his combative energy except in\r\nliterature, we should perhaps understand the motives of Juvenal's satire\r\nand the place which is his due as a representative of the genius of his\r\ncountry. As a man he shows many of the strong qualities of the old Roman\r\nplebeian--the aggressive boldness, the intolerance of superiority and\r\nprivilege, which animated the tribunes in their opposition to the\r\nsenatorian rule. Even where we least like him we find nothing small or\r\nmean to alienate our respect from him. Though he loses no opportunity of\r\nbeing coarse, he is not licentious; though he is often truculent, he\r\ncannot be called malignant. It is, indeed, impossible to say what\r\nmotives of personal chagrin, of love of detraction, of the mere literary\r\npassion for effective writing, may have contributed to the indignation\r\nwhich inspired his verse. But the prevailing impression we carry away\r\nafter reading him is that in all his early satires he was animated by a\r\nsincere and manly detestation of the tyranny and cruelty, the debauchery\r\nand luxury, the levity and effeminacy, the crimes and frauds, which we\r\nknow from other sources were then rife in Rome, and that a more serene\r\nwisdom and a happier frame of mind were attained by him when old age had\r\nsomewhat allayed the fierce rage which vexed his manhood.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The remarkable statements in a \"life\" found in a late\r\n  Italian MS. (Barberini, viii. 18), \"Iunius Iuvenalis Aquinas Iunio\r\n  Iuvenale patre matre vero Septumuleia ex Aquinati municipio Claudio\r\n  Nerone et L. Antistio consulibus (55) natus est, sororem habuit\r\n  Septumuleiam quae Fuscino (_Sat._ xiv. 1) nupsit,\" though not\r\n  necessarily false, cannot be accepted without confirmation.\r\n\r\n  The earliest evidence for the banishment of Juvenal is that of\r\n  Sidonius Apollinaris (c. 480), _Carm._ ix. 269, \"Non qui tempore\r\n  Caesaris secundi | Aeterno coluit Tomos reatu | Nec qui consimili\r\n  deinde casu | Ad vulgi tenuem strepentis auram | Irati fuit histrionis\r\n  exul,\" lines which by the exact parallel drawn between Ovid's fate and\r\n  Juvenal's imply the belief that Juvenal died in exile. The banishment\r\n  is also mentioned by J. Malalas, a Greek historian subsequent to\r\n  Justinian, who gives the place as Pentapolis in Africa, _Chron._ x.\r\n  262, Dindorf. The inscription (on a stone now lost) is as follows, the\r\n  words and letters in brackets being the conjectural restorations of\r\n  scholars:--\"[Cere] ri sacrum | [D. Iu] nius Iuvenalis | trib. coh. [I]\r\n  Delmatarum | II vir quinq. flamen | divi Vespasiani | vovit\r\n  dedicav[it] que | sua pec.,\" _Corp. inscr. lat._ X. 5382, xiii. 201\r\n  sqq. The best of the known manuscripts of Juvenal (P) is at\r\n  Montpellier (125); but there are several others which cannot be\r\n  neglected. Amongst these may be specially mentioned the Bodleian MS.\r\n  (Canon. Lat. 41), which contains a portion of Satire vi., the\r\n  existence of which was unknown until E. O. Winstedt published it in\r\n  the _Classical Review_ (1899), pp. 201 seq. Another fragment in the\r\n  Bibliotheque Nationale was described by C. E. Stuart in the _Classical\r\n  Quarterly_ (Jan. 1909). Numerous scholia and glossaries attest the\r\n  interest taken in Juvenal in post-classical times and the middle ages.\r\n  There are two classes of scholia--the older or \"Pithoeana,\" first\r\n  published by P. Pithoeus, and the \"Cornutus scholia\" of less value,\r\n  specimens of which have been published by various scholars. The\r\n  earliest edition which need now be mentioned is that of P. Pithoeus,\r\n  1585, in which P was first used for the text. Amongst later ones we\r\n  may mention the commentaries of Ruperti (1819) and C. F. Heinrich\r\n  (1839, with the old scholia), O. Jahn (1851, critical with the old\r\n  scholia), A. Weidner (1889), L. Friedlander (1895, with a full verbal\r\n  index). The most useful English commentaries are those of J. E. B.\r\n  Mayor (a voluminous and learned commentary on thirteen of the\r\n  _Satires_, ii., vi. and ix. being omitted), J. D. Lewis (1882, with a\r\n  prose translation) and J. D. Duff (1898, expurgated, and ii. and ix.\r\n  being omitted). There are recent critical texts: conservative and\r\n  chiefly based on P, by F. Buecheler (1893, with selections from the\r\n  scholia) and S. G. Owen (in the Oxford Series of Texts); on the other\r\n  side, by A. E. Housman (1905) and by the same, but with fewer\r\n  innovations, in the new _Corpus poetarum latinorum_, fasc. v. The two\r\n  last-named editors alone give the newly discovered lines of Satire vi.\r\n  There are no recent translations of Juvenal into English verse. Dryden\r\n  translated i., iii., vi., x. and xvi., the others being committed to\r\n  inferior hands. Other versions are Gifford's (1802), of some merit,\r\n  and C. Badham's (1814). Johnson's imitations of Satires iii. and x.\r\n  are well known. For the numerous articles and contributions to the\r\n  criticism and elucidation of the _Satires_, reference should be made\r\n  to Teuffel's _Geschichte der romischen Litteratur_ (Eng. trans. by\r\n  Warre), S 331, and Schanz, ditto (1901, ii.

Nothing is known of him except that he\r\nwas a Spanish presbyter of distinguished family. About 330 he published\r\nhis _Libri evangeliorum IV._, each book containing about 800 hexameters.\r\nThe division into books is possibly a reminiscence of the number of the\r\nGospels. The work itself, written with the idea of ousting the\r\nabsurdities of Pagan mythology and replacing them by the truths of\r\nChristianity, may be called the first Christian epic. In the _Praefatio_\r\nthe author expresses the hope that the sacredness of his subject may\r\nprocure him safety at the final conflagration of the world and admission\r\ninto heaven. The whole is, in the main, a poetical version of the Gospel\r\nof Matthew, the other evangelists only being used for supplementary\r\ndetails. It is founded upon a pre-vulgate Latin translation, although\r\nthere is evidence that Juvencus also consulted the Greek. In spite of\r\nmetrical irregularities, the language and style are simple and show good\r\ntaste, being free from the artificiality of other Christian poets and\r\nprose writers, and the author has made excellent use of Virgil (his\r\nchief model) and other classical writers. Juvencus set the fashion of\r\nverse translations of the Bible, and the large number of MSS. of his\r\npoem mentioned in lists and still extant are sufficient evidence of its\r\ngreat popularity. According to Jerome, he was also the author of some\r\npoems on the sacraments, but no trace of these has survived. The Latin\r\n_Heptateuch_, a hexameter version of the first seven books of the Old\r\nTestament, has been attributed to Juvencus amongst others; but it is now\r\ngenerally supposed to be the work of a certain Cyprianus, a Gaul who\r\nlived in the 6th century, possibly a bishop of Toulon, author of the\r\n_Life of Caesarius_, bishop of Arelate (Arles).\r\n\r\n  See M.

In modern social science the question of the proper\r\npenal treatment of juvenile (i.e. non-adult) offenders has been\r\nincreasingly discussed; and the reformatory principle, first applied in\r\nthe case of children, has even been extended to reclaimable adult\r\noffenders (juveniles in crime, if not in age) in a way which brings them\r\nsufficiently within the same category to be noticed in this article. In\r\nthe old days the main idea in England was to use the same penal methods\r\nfor all criminals, young and old; when the child broke the law he was\r\nsent to prison like his elders. It was only in comparatively recent\r\ntimes that it was realized that child criminals were too often the\r\nvictims to circumstances beyond their own control. They were cursed with\r\ninherited taint; they were brought up among evil surroundings; they\r\nsuffered from the culpable neglect of vicious parents, and still more\r\nfrom bad example and pernicious promptings. They were rather potential\r\nthan actual criminals, calling for rescue and regeneration rather than\r\nvindictive reprisals. Under the old system a painstaking English gaol\r\nchaplain calculated that 58% of all criminals had made their first lapse\r\nat fifteen. Boys and girls laughed at imprisonment. Striplings of\r\nthirteen and fourteen had been committed ten, twelve, sixteen or\r\nseventeen times. Religion and moral improvement were little regarded in\r\nprisons, industrial and technical training were impossible. The chief\r\nlesson learnt was an intimate and contemptuous acquaintance with the\r\ndemoralizing interior of a gaol. There were at one time in London 200\r\n\"flash houses\" frequented by 6000 boys trained and proficient in\r\nthieving and depredation.\r\n\r\nThe substantial movement for reform dates from the protests of Charles\r\nDickens, who roused public opinion to such an extent that the first\r\nReformatory School Act was passed in 1854. Sporadic efforts to meet the\r\nevil had indeed been made earlier. In 1756 the Marine Society\r\nestablished a school for the reception and reform of younger criminals;\r\nin 1788 the City of London formed a similar institution, which grew much\r\nlater into the farm school at Redhlll. In 1838 an act of parliament\r\ncreated an establishment at Parkhurst for the detention and correction\r\nof juvenile offenders, to whom pardon was given conditional on their\r\nentrance into some charitable institution. Parkhurst was technically a\r\nprison, and the system combined industrial training with religious and\r\neducational instruction. These earlier efforts had, however, been quite\r\ninsufficient to meet the evils, for in the years immediately preceding\r\n1854 crime was being so constantly reinforced in its beginnings, under\r\nthe existing penal system, that it threatened to swamp the country.\r\nUnofficial, but more or less accurate, figures showed that between\r\n11,000 and 12,000 juveniles passed annually through the prisons of\r\nEngland and Wales, a third of the whole number being contributed by\r\nLondon alone. In 1854 the total reached 14,000. The ages of offenders\r\nranged from less than twelve to seventeen; 60% of the whole were between\r\nfourteen and seventeen; 46% had been committed more than once; 18% four\r\ntimes and more.\r\n\r\nThe Reformatory School Act 1854, which was thrashed out at conferences\r\nheld in Birmingham in 1851 and 1853, substituted the school for the\r\ngaol, and all judicial benches were empowered to send delinquents to\r\nschools when they had been guilty of acts punishable by short\r\nimprisonment, the limit of which was at first fourteen and became\r\nafterwards ten days. A serious flaw in this act long survived; this was\r\nthe provision that a short period of imprisonment in gaol must precede\r\nreception into the reformatory; it was upheld by well-meaning but\r\nmistaken people as essential for deterrence. But more enlightened\r\nopinion condemned the rule as inflicting an indelible prison taint and\r\nbreeding contamination, even with ample and effective safeguards. Wiser\r\nlegislation has followed, and an act of 1899 abolished preliminary\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nExisting reformatories, or \"senior home office schools\" as they are\r\nofficially styled, in England numbered 44 in 1907. They receive all\r\njuvenile offenders, up to the age of sixteen, who have been convicted of\r\nan offence punishable with penal servitude or imprisonment. The number\r\nof these during the years between 1894 and 1906 constantly varied, but\r\nthe figure of the earliest date, 6604, was never exceeded, and in some\r\nyears it was considerably less, while in 1906 it was no more than 5586,\r\nthough the general population had increased by several millions in the\r\nperiod. These figures, in comparison with those of 1854, must be deemed\r\nhighly satisfactory, even when we take into account that the latter went\r\nup to the age of seventeen. Older offenders, between sixteen and\r\ntwenty-one, come within the category of juvenile adults and are dealt\r\nwith differently (see _Borstal Scheme_ below).\r\n\r\nOther schools must be classed with the reformatory, although they have\r\nno connexion with prisons and deal with youths who are only potential\r\ncriminals. The first in importance are the industrial schools. When the\r\nnewly devised reformatories were doing excellent service it was realized\r\nthat many of the rising generation might some day lapse into evil ways\r\nbut were still on the right side and might with proper precautions be\r\nkept there. They wanted preventive, not punitive treatment, and for them\r\nindustrial schools were instituted. The germ of these establishments\r\nexisted in the Ragged Schools, \"intended to educate destitute children\r\nand save them from vagrancy and crime.\" They had been invented by John\r\nPounds (1766-1839), a Portsmouth shoemaker, who, early in the 19th\r\ncentury, was moved with sympathy for these little outcasts and devoted\r\nhimself to this good work. The ragged school movement found powerful\r\nsupport in active philanthropists when public attention was aroused to\r\nthe prevalence of juvenile delinquency. The first Industrial School Act\r\nwas passed in 1856 and applied only to Scotland. Next year its\r\nprovisions were extended to England, and their growth was rapid. There\r\nwere 45 schools in the beginning; in 1878 the number had more than been\r\ndoubled; in 1907 there were 102 in England and Wales and 31 in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Education Acts 1871 and 1876 led to a large\r\nincrease in the number of children committed for breaches of the law and\r\nto the establishment of two kinds of subsidiary industrial schools,\r\nshort detention of truant schools and day industrial schools in which\r\nchildren do not reside but receive their meals, their elementary\r\neducation and a certain amount of industrial training. The total\r\nadmissions to truant schools in 1907 were 1368 boys, and the numbers\r\nactually in the schools on the last day of that year were 1125 with 2568\r\non licence. The average length of detention was fourteen weeks and three\r\ndays on first admission, seventeen weeks and five days on first\r\nre-admission, and twenty-three weeks six days on second re-admission.\r\nThe total number of admissions into truant schools from 1878 to the end\r\nof 1907 was 44,315, of whom just half had been licensed and not\r\nreturned, 11,239 had been licensed and once re-admitted, 8900 had been\r\nre-admitted twice or oftener.\r\n\r\nThe day industrial schools owed their origin to another reason than the\r\nenforcement of the Education Acts. It was found that some special\r\ntreatment was required for large masses of youths in large cities, who\r\nwere in such a neglected or degraded condition that there was little\r\nhope of their growing into healthy men and women or becoming good\r\ncitizens. They were left unclean, were ill-fed and insufficiently\r\nclothed, and were not usefully taught. The total number who attended\r\nthese day schools in 1907 was 1951 boys and 1232 girls.\r\n\r\nThe disciplinary system of the English schools is planned upon the\r\nestablishment or institution system, as opposed to that of the \"family\"\r\nor \"boarding out\" systems adopted in some countries, and some\r\ncontroversy has been aroused as to the comparative value of the methods.\r\nThe British practice has always favoured the well-governed school, with\r\nthe proviso that it is kept small so that the head may know all of his\r\ncharges. But a compromise has been effected in large establishments by\r\ndividing the boys into \"houses,\" each containing a small manageable\r\ntotal as a family under an official father or head. Under this system\r\nthe idea of the home is maintained, while uniformity of treatment and\r\ndiscipline is secured by grouping several houses together under one\r\ngeneral authority. The plan of \"boarding out\" is not generally approved\r\nof in England; the value of the domestic training is questionable and of\r\nuncertain quality, depending entirely upon the character and fitness of\r\nthe foster-parents secured. Education must be less systematic in the\r\nprivate home, industrial training is less easily carried out, and there\r\ncan be none of that _esprit de corps_ that stimulates effort in physical\r\ntraining as applied to athletics and the playing of games. No very\r\ndefinite decision has been arrived at as to the comparative merits of\r\ninstitution life and boarding out. Among the Latin races--France, Italy,\r\nPortugal and Spain--the former is as a rule preferred; also in Belgium;\r\nin Germany, Holland and the United States placing out in private\r\nfamilies is very much the rule; in Austria-Hungary and Russia both\r\nmethods are in use.\r\n\r\n  The total admissions to English reformatory schools from their\r\n  creation to the 31st of December 1907 amounted to 76,455, or 64,031\r\n  boys and 12,424 girls. The total discharges for the same period were\r\n  70,890, or 59,081 boys and 11,809 girls. The results may be tested by\r\n  the figures for those discharged in 1904, 1905 and 1906:--\r\n\r\n  _Boys._--3573 were placed out, of whom 66 had died, leaving 3507; of\r\n  these it was found that 2735 (or about 78%) were in regular\r\n  employment; 158 (or about 4%) were in casual employment; 439 (or about\r\n  13%) had been convicted; and 175 (or about 5%) were unknown.\r\n\r\n  _Girls._--480, of whom 11 had died, leaving 469; of these it was found\r\n  that 384 (or about 82%) were in regular employment; 28 (or about 6%)\r\n  were in casual employment; 17 (or about 4%) had been convicted, and 40\r\n  (or about 8%) were unknown.\r\n\r\n  For industrial schools, including truant and day schools, the total\r\n  admissions, up to the 31st of December 1907, were 153,893, or 120,955\r\n  boys and 32,938 girls. The total discharges to the same date\r\n  (excluding transfers) were 136,961, or 108,398 boys and 28,563 girls.\r\n  The results as tested by those discharged in 1904, 1905 and 1906 were\r\n  as follow:--\r\n\r\n  _Boys._--8909 were placed out, of whom 118 had since died, leaving\r\n  8791 to be reported on; of these it was found that 7547 (or about 86%)\r\n  were in regular employment; 415 (or about 4.7%) were in casual\r\n  employment; 419 (or about 4.7%) convicted or re-committed; and 410 (or\r\n  about 4.6%) unknown.\r\n\r\n  _Girls._--2505 placed out, of whom 50 had died, leaving 2455; of these\r\n  2180 (or about 89%) were in regular employment; 112 (or about 4%) were\r\n  in casual employment; 21 (or about 1%) convicted or re-committed; and\r\n  142 (or about 6%) unknown.\r\n\r\n  These results are of course wholly independent of those achieved by\r\n  the juvenile-adult prison reformatory at Borstal instituted in October\r\n  1902. The record of the first year's work of this excellent system\r\n  showed that 50% of cases placed out had done well, thanks to the\r\n  system and philanthropic labours of the Borstal Association.\r\n\r\n  An interesting point in regard to the reclamation of these criminally\r\n  inclined juveniles is the nature of the employments to which they have\r\n  been recommended, and in which, as shown, they have done so well. In\r\n  1904, 1905 and 1906, the total number of boys discharged and placed\r\n  was 12,482. By far the largest number of these, nearly a sixth, joined\r\n  the army, 679 of them entering the bands; 292 joined the navy; 961 the\r\n  mercantile marine; 1567 went to farm service; 414 worked in factories\r\n  or mills as skilled hands; but others joined as labourers, a general\r\n  class the total of which was 1096. Other jobs found included miners\r\n  (629), carters (352), iron or steel workers (214), mechanics (301),\r\n  shoemakers (181), tailors (161), shop assistants (228), carpenters\r\n  (178), bakers (131), messengers and porters, including 112 errand boys\r\n  (315). The balance found employment in smaller numbers at other\r\n  trades. The fate of 585 was unknown, 858 had been re-convicted, and\r\n  the balance were in unrecorded or casual employment.\r\n\r\n  The outlets found by the girls from these various schools naturally\r\n  follow lines appropriate to their sex and the instruction received.\r\n  Out of a total of 2985 discharged in the three years mentioned, 1235\r\n  became general servants, 268 housemaids, 203 laundry-maids, 52 cooks,\r\n  98 nursemaids, 65 dressmakers, 221 were engaged in factories and\r\n  mills, and the balance was made up by marriage, death or casual\r\n  employment.\r\n\r\n  In Ireland the reformatory and industrial school system conforms to\r\n  that of Great Britain. There were in 1905 six reformatory and 70\r\n  industrial schools in Ireland, mostly under Roman Catholic management.\r\n\r\nA short account of the reformatory methods of dealing with juvenile\r\noffenders in certain other countries will fitly find a place here.\r\n\r\n_Austria-Hungary._--The law leaves children of less than ten years of\r\nage to domestic discipline, as also children above that age if not\r\nexactly criminal, although the latter may be sent to correctional\r\nschools. There they are detained for varying periods, but never after\r\ntwenty years of age, and they may be sent out on licence to situations\r\nor employment found for them. These schools also receive children\r\nbetween ten and fourteen guilty of crimes which are, however, by law\r\ndeemed \"contraventions\" only; also the destitute between the same ages\r\nand the incorrigible whose parents cannot manage them.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary the penal code prescribes that children of less than twelve\r\ncannot be charged with offences; those between twelve and sixteen may be\r\ndeemed to have acted without discretion, and thus escape sentence, but\r\nare sent to a correctional school where they may be detained till they\r\nare twenty years of age. An excellent system prevails in Hungary by\r\nwhich the supervision of those liberated is entrusted to a \"protector,\"\r\na philanthropic person in the district who visits and reports upon the\r\nconduct of the boys, much like the \"probation officer\" in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n_Belgium._--The law of November 1891 places the whole mass of\r\njuveniles--those who are likely to give trouble and those who have\r\nalready done so--at the disposal of the state. The system is very\r\nelastic, realizing the infinite variety of childish natures. The purely\r\npaternal regime would be wasted upon the really vicious; a severe\r\ndiscipline would press too heavily on the well-disposed. Accordingly,\r\nall juveniles, male and female, are divided into six principal classes\r\nwith a corresponding treatment, it being strictly ruled that there is no\r\nintermingling of the classes; the very youngest, rescued early, are\r\nnever to be associated with the older, who may be already vicious and\r\ndegraded and who could not fail to exercise a pernicious influence. One\r\nof the great merits of the Belgian system is that the regulations may be\r\nrelaxed, and children of whose amendment good hopes are entertained may\r\nbe released provisionally, either to the care of parents and guardians\r\nor to employers, artisans or agriculturists who will teach them a trade.\r\n\r\n_Denmark._--There were 61 establishments of all classes for juveniles in\r\nDenmark in 1906, holding some 2000 inmates. In 1874, by the will of\r\nCountess Danner, a large female refuge was founded at Castle Jagerspris,\r\nwhich holds some 360 girls. Another of the same class is the Royal\r\nVodrofsvei Bonnehjem at Copenhagen, founded in the same year by Mlle\r\nSchneider. The regime preferred in Denmark is that of the family or the\r\nvery small school. The Jagerspris system is to divide the whole number\r\nof 360 into small parties of 20 each under a nurse or official mother.\r\nEmployment in Danish schools is mainly agricultural, field labour and\r\ngardening, with a certain amount of industrial training; and on\r\ndischarge the inmates go to farms or to apprenticeship, while a few\r\nemigrate.\r\n\r\n_France._--There are five methods of disposing of juvenile offenders in\r\nFrance:--\r\n\r\n  1. The preliminary or preventative prison (_maisons d'arret_ and _de\r\n  justice_) for those arrested and accused.\r\n\r\n  2. The ordinary prison for all sentenced to less than six months,\r\n  whose time of detention is too short to admit of their transfer to a\r\n  provincial colony. It also receives children whom parents have found\r\n  unmanageable.\r\n\r\n  3. The public or private penitentiary colony for the irresponsible\r\n  children, acquitted as \"without discretion,\" as well as for the guilty\r\n  sentenced to more than six months' and less than two years' detention.\r\n\r\n  4. The correctional colony, where the system is more severe, receiving\r\n  all sentenced for more than two years and all who have misconducted\r\n  themselves in the milder establishments.\r\n\r\n  5. Various penitentiary houses for young females, whatever their\r\n  particular sentence.\r\n\r\nForemost among French penal reformers stands the name of F. A. Demetz\r\n(1796-1873), the founder of the famous colony of Mettray. M. Demetz was\r\na judge who, aghast at the evils inflicted upon children whom he was\r\ncompelled by law to imprison, left the bench and undertook to find some\r\nother outlet for them. At that time the French law, while it acquitted\r\nminors shown to have acted without discretion, still consigned them for\r\nsafe keeping and inevitable contamination to the common gaols. M. Demetz\r\nconceived the idea of an agricultural colony, and in 1840 organized a\r\nsmall \"_societe paternelle_,\" as it was called, of which he became\r\nvice-president. Another philanthropist, the Vicomte de Bretignieres de\r\nCourteilles, a landed proprietor in Touraine, associated himself in the\r\nenterprise and endowed the institution with land at Mettray near Tours.\r\nThe earliest labours at Mettray were in the development of the\r\ninstitution, but as this approached completion they were applied to\r\nfarmwork, agricultural employment being the chief feature of the place.\r\nThe motto and device of Mettray was \"the moralization of youth by the\r\ncultivation of the soil\"; a healthy life in the open air was to replace\r\nthe enervating and demoralizing influences of the confined prisons; and\r\nthis was effected in the usual farming operations, to which were added\r\ngardening, vine-dressing, the raising of stock and the breeding of\r\nsilkworms. The labour was not light; on the contrary, the directors of\r\nthe colony sought by constant employment to send their charges to bed\r\ntired, ready to sleep soundly and not romp and chatter in their\r\ndormitories. The excellence of its aims, and the manifestly good results\r\nthat were growing out of the system, soon made Mettray a model for\r\nimitation in France and beyond it. Many establishments were planned upon\r\nit, started by the state or private enterprise; penitentiary colonies\r\nwere created for boys in connexion with some of the great central\r\nprisons. The colony of Val de Yevre has a good record. It was started by\r\na private philanthropist, Charles J. M. Lucas, (1803-1889) but after\r\nfive-and-twenty years was handed over to the state. Other cognate\r\nestablishments are those of Petit Quevilly near Rouen, Petit Bourg near\r\nParis, St Hiliar and Eysses. There are several female colonies,\r\nespecially that of Darnetal at Rouen.\r\n\r\nIt is for the magistrate or _juge d'instruction_ to select the class of\r\nestablishment to which the juvenile delinquents brought before him shall\r\nbe committed. The very young, those of twelve years of age and under,\r\nare placed out in the country with families, unless they can be again\r\nentrusted to their parents or committed to _maisons paternels_,\r\ncontaining very limited numbers, twenty or thirty, in charge of a large\r\nstaff. After twelve, and from that age to fourteen or fifteen, the\r\n\"ungrateful age\" as the French call it, boys are sent to a reformatory\r\nor \"preservative school,\" where they will be under stronger discipline.\r\nFor the third class, from fifteen to sixteen or eighteen, stricter\r\nmeasures are necessary, so as to dispose of them in specially selected\r\npenal colonies, as has already been done at Eysses, where the discipline\r\nis severe, while embodying technical and industrial instruction.\r\n\r\n_Germany._--In most parts of the German Empire juvenile delinquents and\r\nneglected youths are treated in the same establishments. No child of\r\nless than twelve years of age can be proceeded against in a court of\r\nlaw, although in some German states destitute or abandoned children have\r\nbeen taken at the ages of six, five and even three years. Youths between\r\ntwelve and eighteen may be convicted, but their offences are passed over\r\nif they are proved to have acted without discretion. There are many\r\nkinds of correctional institutions and a number of schools not of a\r\ncorrectional character. These last are generally very small, the largest\r\ntaking barely a hundred, but are very numerous. Many private persons\r\nhave devoted themselves to the work. Count A. von der Recke-Volmerstein\r\n(1791-1878) about 1821 founded a refuge for neglected children in\r\nDusselthal, between Dusseldorf and Elberstadt. Pastor T. F. Fliedner\r\n(1800-1864) built up a fine establishment at Kaiserswerth from 1833, in\r\nwhich was an infant school, a penitentiary and an orphan asylum. Another\r\nfamous name is that of W. von Turk (1774-1846), who studied under\r\nPestalozzi in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nA school which has largely influenced public opinion in Great Britain,\r\nas in Germany, is the Rauhe Haus, near Hamburg, founded by Dr Wickern in\r\n1833. This began with a single cottage but had grown in twenty years to\r\na hamlet of twenty houses, with from twelve to sixteen inmates in each.\r\nThe establishment is a Lutheran one; both boys and girls are admitted,\r\nin separate houses, and a marked feature of the place is the number of\r\n\"brothers,\" young men of good character qualifying for rescue work as\r\nsuperintendents of homes, prison officers and schoolmasters. They take\r\npart in the work and are in constant touch with the boys whom they\r\nclosely supervise, being bound to \"keep them in sight day and night, eat\r\nwith them, sleep in their dormitories, direct their labour, accompany\r\nthem to chapel, join in their recreations and sports.\" These \"brothers\"\r\nare honourably known throughout the world and have performed a large\r\nwork in distant lands as missionaries, prison officers and\r\nschoolmasters. The Rauhe Haus receives three classes of juveniles:\r\nfirst, the boys, mostly street arabs; second, girls of the same\r\ncategory; third, children taken as boarders from private families, who\r\nconfess their inability to manage them. The instruction given is in\r\ntrades, in farming operations, gardening and fruit-raising. The pupils\r\nare largely assisted on release, through the good offices of the\r\ncitizens of Hamburg.\r\n\r\n_Holland._--In the Low Countries, refuges, called \"Godshuis,\" were\r\nfounded as early as the 14th century, intended for the care and shelter\r\nof neglected youth and indigent old age. In the 17th century people came\r\nfrom all parts of Europe to learn from the Dutch how orphans and\r\nunfortunate children could best be cared for. The Godshuis of Amsterdam\r\nwas a vast establishment, into which as many as 4000 juveniles were\r\nsometimes crowded, with such disastrous effects that its name was\r\nchanged to that of \"pesthuis,\" and the government in the beginning of\r\nthe present century ordered it to be emptied and closed. Other\r\nreformatory institutions in Holland are the Netherlands Mettray, the\r\nreform school of Zetten, near the Arnheim railway station, for\r\nProtestant girls; and that of Alkmaar for boys; the reformatory school\r\nof St Vincent de Paul at Amsterdam for both sexes; the Amsterdam\r\nreformatory for young vagabonds, male and female; the reform school of\r\nSmallepod at Amsterdam. The Netherlands Mettray, which is about five\r\nhours' journey from Amsterdam on a farm called Rissjelt, near Zutphen,\r\nis planned on the model of the French Mettray and was founded about 1855\r\nby M. Suringar, a veteran Dutch philanthropist, long vice-president of\r\nthe directors of prisons in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n_Italy._--In Italy there is no distinction between the treatment of the\r\noffending and the neglected or deserted in youth. There are seventeen or\r\nmore correctional establishments, eight of which are state institutions\r\nand the rest founded by private benevolence or by charitable\r\nassociations or local communities. None of these is exclusively\r\nagricultural; ten are industrial, seven industrial and agricultural\r\ncombined. In Italy the age of responsibility is nine, below which no\r\nchild can be charged with an offence. The Italian schools are mostly\r\nplanned on a large scale. That of Marchiondi Spagliardi accommodates\r\n550, divided among three houses under one supreme head. The Turazza\r\ninstitution at Treviso holds 380, and there are eight others with from\r\n200 to 300 inmates. The regime is very various; the larger number of\r\nschools are on the congregate system, with daily labour in association\r\nand isolation by night. The \"family\" method is also practised with small\r\ngroups, divisions or companies, into which the children are formed\r\naccording to age or conduct.\r\n\r\n_Sweden._--All children below the age of sixteen may be sent to a\r\ncorrectional establishment or boarded out in respectable families:--\r\n\r\n  1. If they have committed acts punishable by law which indicate moral\r\n  perversity and it is deemed advisable to correct them.\r\n\r\n  2. If they are neglected, ill-used, or if their moral deterioration is\r\n  feared from the vicious life and character of parents or friends.\r\n\r\n  3. If their conduct at school or at home is such that a more severe\r\n  correctional treatment is necessary for their rescue.\r\n\r\nUnder this law the state is also to provide special schools to take all\r\nabove ten who have shown peculiar depravity; all who have reached\r\neighteen and who are not yet thought fit for freedom; all who have\r\nrelapsed after provisional release. Sweden is rich in institutions\r\ndevoted to the care of destitute and deserted children, all due to the\r\nefforts of the charitable. The largest correctional establishment is\r\nthat founded at Hall, near the town of Sodertelge on the shores of the\r\nBaltic. This admirable agricultural colony, modelled on that of Mettray,\r\nowes its existence to the \"Oscar-Josephine society,\" founded by Queen\r\nJosephine, widow of Oscar I.\r\n\r\n_United States._--In the words of a report made in 1878 by F. B.\r\nSanborn, secretary of the American Social Science Society, \"America can\r\njustly plume herself upon the work accomplished by her juvenile\r\nreformatories since their inauguration down to the present time.\" The\r\nfirst in point of date and still the most considerable of the\r\nreformatories in the United States is that founded in 1825, thanks to\r\nthe unwearied efforts of the great American publicist and philanthropist\r\nEdward Livingston, which now has its home on Randall's Island in New\r\nYork City. In the following year a reformatory of the same class was\r\nfounded in Boston, and another in the year after in Philadelphia. All\r\nwere intended to receive criminal youth. There are state reformatories\r\nnow in almost all the states of the Union, and those for juvenile adults\r\nin New York and Massachusetts have attracted world-wide attention,\r\naiming so high and with such an elaboration of means that they deserve\r\nparticular description.\r\n\r\nThe great state reformatory establishment of Elmira, New York, called\r\ninto existence in 1889 with the avowed aim of compassing the reformation\r\nof the criminal by new processes, partakes of the system involved in the\r\ntreatment of juvenile offenders. It was based upon the principle that\r\ncrime ought to be attacked in its beginnings by other than ordinary\r\npunitive and prison methods. Under this view, the right of society to\r\ndefend itself by punishment was denied, and it was held that a youthful\r\noffender was more sinned against than sinning. It was urged that his\r\ncrime, due largely to inherited defects, mental or physical and vicious\r\nsurroundings, was not his own fault, and he had a paramount claim to be\r\ntreated differently by the state when in custody. The state was not\r\njustified in using powers of repression to imprison him in the usual\r\nmechanical hard and fast fashion and then return him to society, no\r\nbetter, possibly worse, than before; it was bound to regenerate him, to\r\nchange his nature, improve his physique, and give him a new mental\r\nequipment, so that when again at large he might be fitted to take his\r\nplace amongst honest citizens, to earn his living by reputable means and\r\nescape all temptation to drift back into crime. This is the plausible\r\nexplanation given for the state reformatory movement, which led to the\r\ncreation on such costly and extensive lines of Elmira, and of Concord in\r\nMassachusetts, a cognate establishment. There is very little penal about\r\nthe treatment, which is that of a boarding school; the education,\r\nthorough and carried far, includes languages, music, science and\r\nindustrial art; diet is plentiful, even luxurious; amusements and varied\r\nrecreation are permitted; well stocked libraries are provided with\r\nentertaining books; a prison newspaper is issued (edited by an inmate).\r\nPhysical development is sedulously cultivated both by gymnastics and\r\nmilitary exercises, and the whole course is well adapted to change\r\nentirely the character of the individual subjected to it. The trouble\r\ntaken in the hope of transforming erring youth into useful members of\r\nsociety goes still further. The original sentence has been indefinite,\r\nand release on parole will be granted to inmates who pass through the\r\nvarious courses with credit and are supposed to have satisfied the\r\nauthorities of their desire to amend. The limit of detention need not\r\nexceed twelve months, after which parole is possible, although the\r\naverage period passed before it is granted is twenty-two months. The\r\nhope of permanent amendment is further sought by the fact that a\r\nsituation, generally with good wages and congenial work, provided by the\r\nauthorities, awaits every inmate at the time of his discharge. The\r\ninmates, selected from a very large class, are first offenders, but\r\nguilty generally of criminal offences, which include manslaughter,\r\nburglary, forgery, fraud, robbery and receiving. The exact measure of\r\nreformation achieved can never be exactly known, from the absence of\r\nauthentic statistics and the difficulty of following up the surveillance\r\nof individuals when released on parole. Reports issued by the manager of\r\nElmira claim that 81% of those paroled have done well, but these results\r\nare not definitely authenticated. They are based upon the ascertained\r\ngood conduct during the term of surveillance, six or twelve months only,\r\nduring which time these subjects have not yet spent the gratuities\r\nearned and have probably still kept the situations found for them on\r\ndischarge. No doubt the material treated at Elmira and Concord is of a\r\nkind to encourage hope of reformation, as they are first offenders and\r\npresumably not of the criminal classes. Although the processes are open\r\nto criticism, the discipline enforced in these state reformatories does\r\nnot err in excessive leniency. They are not \"hotels,\" as has been\r\nsometimes said in ridicule, where prisoners go to enjoy themselves, have\r\na good time, study Plato and conic sections, and pass out to an assured\r\nfuture. There is plenty of hard work, mental and physical, and the\r\n\"inmates\" rather envy their fellows in state prisons. A point to which\r\ngreat attention is paid is that physical degeneracy lies at the bottom\r\nof the criminal character, and great attention is paid to the\r\ndevelopment of nervous energy and strengthening by every means the\r\nnormal and healthful functions of the body. A leading feature in the\r\ntreatment is the frequency and perfection with which bathing is carried\r\nout. A series of Turkish baths forms a part of the course of\r\ninstruction; the baths being fitted elaborately with all the adjuncts of\r\nshower bath, cold douche, ending with gymnastic exercises.\r\n\r\nA remarkable and unique institution is the state reformatory for women\r\nat Sherborn, Massachusetts, for women with sentences of more than a\r\nyear, who in the opinion of the court are fit subjects for reformatory\r\ntreatment. The majority of the inmates were convicted of drunkenness, an\r\noffence which the law of Massachusetts visits with severity--a sentence\r\nof two years being very common. This at once differentiates the class of\r\nwomen from that in ordinary penal establishments. At the same time we\r\nfind that other women guilty of serious crime are sent by the courts to\r\nthis prison with a view to their reform. Thus of 352 inmates, while no\r\nfewer than 200 were convicted of drunkenness, there were also 63 cases\r\nof offences against chastity and 30 of larceny. The average age was\r\nthirty-one and the average duration of sentence just over a year. In\r\nappearance and in character it more resembles a hospital or home for\r\ninebriates than a state convict prison. A system of grades or divisions\r\nis relied upon as a stimulus to reform. The difference in grades is\r\ndenoted by small and scarcely perceptible variations of the little\r\ndetails of everyday life, such as are supposed in a peculiar degree to\r\naffect the appreciation of women, e.g. in the lowest division the women\r\nhave their meals off old and chipped china; in the next the china is\r\nless chipped; in the highest there is no chipped china; in the next\r\nprettily set out with tumblers, cruet-stands and a pepper pot to each\r\nprisoner. The superintendent relies greatly also on the moralizing\r\ninfluence of animals and birds. Well-behaved convicts are allowed to\r\ntend sheep, calves, pigs, chickens, canaries and parrots. This privilege\r\nis highly esteemed and productive, it is said, of the most softening\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nThe \"George Junior Republic\" (q.v.) is a remarkable institution\r\nestablished in 1895 at Freeville, near the centre of New York State, by\r\nMr. William Reuben George. The original features of the institution are\r\nthat the motto \"Nothing without labour\" is rigidly enforced, and that\r\nself-government is carried to a point that, with mere children, would\r\nappear whimsical were it not a proved success. The place is, as the name\r\nimplies, a miniature \"republic\" with laws, legislature, courts and\r\nadministration of its own, all made and carried on by the \"citizens\"\r\nthemselves. The tone and spirit of the place appeared to be excellent\r\nand there is much evidence that in many cases strong and independent\r\ncharacter is developed in children whose antecedents have been almost\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\n_Borstal Scheme in England._--The American system of state reformatories\r\nas above described has been sharply criticized, but the principle that\r\nunderlies it is recognized as, in a measure, sound, and it has been\r\nadopted by the English authorities. Some time back the experiment of\r\nestablishing a penal reformatory for offenders above the age hitherto\r\ncommitted to reformatory schools was resolved upon. This led to the\r\nfoundation of the Borstal scheme, which was first formally started in\r\nOctober 1902. The arguments which had led to it may be briefly stated\r\nhere. It had been conclusively shown that quite half the whole number of\r\nprofessional criminals had been first convicted when under twenty-one\r\nyears of age, when still at a malleable period of development, when in\r\nshort the criminal habit had not yet been definitely formed. Moreover\r\nthese adolescents escaped special reformatory treatment, for sixteen is\r\nin Great Britain the age of criminal majority, after which no youthful\r\noffenders can be committed to the state reformatory schools. But there\r\nwas always a formidable contingent of juvenile adults between sixteen and\r\ntwenty-one, sent to penal servitude, and their numbers although\r\ndiminishing rose to an average total of 15,000. It was accordingly\r\ndecided to create a penal establishment under state control, which should\r\nbe a half-way house between the prison and the reformatory school. A\r\nselection was made of juvenile adults, sentenced to not less than six\r\nmonths and sent to Borstal in 1902 to be treated under rules approved by\r\nthe home secretary. They were to be divided on arrival into three\r\nseparate classes, penal, ordinary and special, with promotion by industry\r\nand good conduct from the lowest to the highest, in which they enjoyed\r\ndistinctive privileges. The general system, educational and disciplinary,\r\nwas intelligent and governed by common sense. Instruction, both manual\r\nand educational, was well suited to the recipients; the first embraced\r\nfield work, market gardening, and a knowledge of useful handicrafts; the\r\nsecond was elementary but sound, aided by well-chosen libraries and\r\nbrightened by the privilege of evening association to play harmless but\r\ninteresting games. Physical development was also guaranteed by gymnastics\r\nand regular exercises. The results were distinctly encouraging. They\r\narrived at Borstal \"rough, untrained cubs,\" but rapidly improved in\r\ndemeanour and inward character, gaining self-reliance and self-respect,\r\nand left the prison on the high road to regeneration. It was wisely\r\nremembered that to secure lasting amendment it is not enough to chasten\r\nthe erring subject, to train his hands, to strengthen his moral sense\r\nwhile still in durance; it is essential to assist him on discharge by\r\nhelping him to find work, and encourage him by timely advice to keep him\r\nin the straight path. Too much praise cannot be accorded to the agencies\r\nand associations which labour strenuously and unceasingly to this\r\nexcellent end. Especial good work has been done by the Borstal\r\nassociation, founded under the patronage of the best known and most\r\ndistinguished persons in English public life--archbishops, judges,\r\ncabinet ministers and privy councillors--which receives the juvenile\r\nadults on their release and helps them to employment. Their labours,\r\nbacked by generous voluntary contributions, have produced very gratifying\r\nresults. Although the offenders originally selected to undergo the\r\nBorstal treatment were those committed for a period of six months, it was\r\nrecognized that this limit was experimental, and that thoroughly\r\nsatisfactory results could only be obtained with sentences of at least a\r\nyear's duration, so as to give the reforming agencies ample time to\r\noperate. In the second year's working of the system it was formally\r\napplied to young convicts sentenced to penal servitude between the ages\r\nof sixteen and twenty-one. In the next year it was adopted for all\r\noffenders between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one committed to prison,\r\nas far as the length of sentence would permit. The commissioners of\r\nprisons, in their _Report_ for the year 1908 (Cd. 4300) thus expressed\r\nthemselves on the working of the experiment:--\r\n\r\n  \"Experience soon began to point to the probable success of this\r\n  general application of the principle, in spite of the fact that the\r\n  prevailing shortness of sentences operated against full benefit being\r\n  derived from reformatory effort. The success was most marked in those\r\n  localities where magistrates, or other benevolent persons, personally\r\n  co-operated in making the scheme a success. Local Borstal committees\r\n  were established at all prisons, and it was arranged that those\r\n  members of the local committees should become _ex officio_ honorary\r\n  members of the Central Borstal Association, which it was intended\r\n  should become, what it now is, the parent society directing the\r\n  general aid on discharge of this category of young prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the general adoption of the Borstal system, there was a\r\nlarge class of young criminals who were outside its effects, those who\r\nwere sentenced to terms of ten days and under for trifling offences.\r\nThese juvenile adults, once having had the fear of prison taken away by\r\nactual experience, were found to come back again and again. To remedy\r\nthis state of affairs, a bill was introduced in 1907 to give effect to\r\nthe principle of a long period of detention for all those showing a\r\ntendency to embark on a criminal career. The bill was, however, dropped,\r\nbut a somewhat similar bill was introduced the next year and became law\r\nunder the title of The Prevention of Crime Act 1908. This measure\r\nintroduces a new departure in the treatment of professional crime by\r\ninitiating a system of detention for habitual criminals (see\r\nRECIDIVISM). The act attempts the reformation of young offenders by\r\ngiving the court power to pass sentence of detention in a Borstal\r\ninstitution for a term of not less than one year nor more than three on\r\nthose between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one who by reason of\r\ncriminal habits or tendencies or association with persons of bad\r\ncharacter require such instruction and discipline as appear most\r\nconducive to their reformation. The power of detention applies also to\r\nreformatory school offences, while such persons as are already\r\nundergoing penal servitude or imprisonment may be transferred to a\r\nBorstal institution if detention would conduce to their advantage. The\r\nestablishment of other Borstal institutions is authorized by the act,\r\nwhile a very useful provision is the power to release on licence if\r\nthere is a reasonable probability that the offender will abstain from\r\ncrime and lead a useful and industrious life. The licence is issued on\r\ncondition that he is placed under the supervision or authority of some\r\nsociety or person willing to take charge of him. Supervision is\r\nintroduced after the expiration of the term of sentence, and power is\r\ngiven to transfer to prison incorrigibles or those exercising a bad\r\ninfluence on the other inmates of a Borstal institution. The act marks a\r\nnoteworthy advance in the endeavour to arrest the growing habit of\r\ncrime.     (A. G.; T. A. I.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUVENTAS (Latin for \"youth\": later _Juventus_), in Roman mythology, the\r\ntutelar goddess of young men. She was worshipped at Rome from very early\r\ntimes. In the front court of the temple of Minerva on the Capitol there\r\nwas a chapel of Juventas, in which a coin had to be deposited by each\r\nyouth on his assumption of the _toga virilis_, and sacrifices were\r\noffered on behalf of the rising manhood of the state. In connexion with\r\nthis chapel it is related that, when the temple was in course of\r\nerection, Terminus, the god of boundaries, and Juventas refused to quit\r\nthe sites they had already appropriated as sacred to themselves, which\r\naccordingly became part of the new sanctuary. This was interpreted as a\r\nsign of the immovable boundaries and eternal youth of the Roman state.\r\nIt should be observed that in the oldest accounts there is no mention of\r\nJuventas, whose name (with that of Mars) was added in support of the\r\naugural prediction. After the Second Punic War Greek elements were\r\nintroduced into her cult. In 218 B.C., by order of the Sibylline books,\r\na _lectisternium_ was prepared for Juventas and a public thanksgiving to\r\nHercules, an association which shows the influence of the Greek Hebe,\r\nthe wife of Heracles. In 207 Marcus Livius Salinator, after the defeat\r\nof Hasdrubal at the battle of Sena, vowed another temple to Juventas in\r\nthe Circus Maximus, which was dedicated in 191 by C. (or M.) Licinius\r\nLucullus; it was destroyed by fire in 16 B.C. and rebuilt by Augustus.\r\nIn imperial times, Juventas personified, not the youth of the Roman\r\nstate, but of the future emperor.\r\n\r\n  See Dion. Halic., iii. 69, iv. 15; Livy v. 54, xxi. 62, xxxvi. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUXON, WILLIAM (1582-1663), English prelate, was the son of Robert Juxon\r\nand was born probably at Chichester, being educated at Merchant Taylors'\r\nSchool, London, and at St John's College, Oxford, where he was elected\r\nto a scholarship in 1598. He studied law at Oxford, but afterwards he\r\ntook holy orders, and in 1609 became vicar of St Giles, Oxford, a living\r\nwhich he retained until he became rector of Somerton, Oxfordshire, in\r\n1615. In December 1621 he succeeded his friend, William Laud, as\r\npresident of St John's College, and in 1626 and 1627 he was\r\nvice-chancellor of the university. Juxon soon obtained other important\r\npositions, including that of chaplain-in-ordinary to Charles I. In 1627\r\nhe was made dean of Worcester and in 1632 he was nominated to the\r\nbishopric of Hereford, an event which led him to resign the presidency\r\nof St John's in January 1633. However, he never took up his episcopal\r\nduties at Hereford, as in October 1633 he was consecrated bishop of\r\nLondon in succession to Laud. He appears to have been an excellent\r\nbishop, and in March 1636 Charles I. entrusted him with important\r\nsecular duties by making him lord high treasurer of England; thus for\r\nthe next five years he was dealing with the many financial and other\r\ndifficulties which beset the king and his advisers. He resigned the\r\ntreasurership in May 1641. During the Civil War the bishop, against whom\r\nno charges were brought in parliament, lived undisturbed at Fulham\r\nPalace, and his advice was often sought by the king, who had a very high\r\nopinion of him, and who at his execution selected him to be with him on\r\nthe scaffold and to administer to him the last consolations of religion.\r\nJuxon was deprived of his bishopric in 1649 and retired to Little\r\nCompton in Gloucestershire, where he had bought an estate, and here he\r\nbecame famous as the owner of a pack of hounds. At the restoration of\r\nCharles II. he became archbishop of Canterbury and in his official\r\ncapacity he took part in the coronation of this king, but his health\r\nsoon began to fail and he died at Lambeth on the 4th of June 1663. By\r\nhis will the archbishop was a benefactor to St John's College, where he\r\nwas buried; he also aided the work of restoring St Paul's Cathedral and\r\nrebuilt the great hall at Lambeth Palace.\r\n\r\n  See W. H. Marah, _Memoirs of Archbishop Juxon and his Times_ (1869);\r\n  the best authority for the archbishop's life is the article by W. H.\r\n  Hutton in the _Dict. Nat.

In its long history the shape of K has changed very\r\nlittle. It is on the inscription of the Moabite Stone (early 9th cent.\r\nB.C.) in the form (written from right to left) of [symbol] and [symbol].\r\nSimilar forms are also found in early Aramaic, but another form [symbol]\r\nor [symbol], which is found in the Phoenician of Cyprus in the 9th or\r\n10th century B.C. has had more effect upon the later development of the\r\nSemitic forms. The length of the two back strokes and the manner in\r\nwhich they join the upright are the only variations in Greek. In various\r\nplaces the back strokes, treated as an angle <, become more rounded (,\r\nso that the letter appears as K, a form which in Latin probably affected\r\nthe development of C (q.v.). In Crete it is elaborated into [symbol] and\r\n[symbol]. In Latin K, which is found in the earliest inscriptions, was\r\nsoon replaced by C, and survived only in the abbreviations for\r\n_Kalendae_ and the proper name _Kaeso_. The original name Kaph became in\r\nGreek _Kappa_. The sound of K throughout has been that of the unvoiced\r\nguttural, varying to some extent in its pronunciation according to the\r\nnature of the vowel sound which followed it. In Anglo-Saxon C replaced K\r\nthrough Latin influence, writing being almost entirely in the hands of\r\necclesiastics. As the sound-changes have been discussed under C it is\r\nnecessary here only to refer to the palatalization of K followed earlier\r\nby a final _e_ as in _watch_ (Middle English _wacche_, Anglo-Saxon\r\n_waecce_) by the side of _wake_ (M.E. _waken_, A.-S. _wacan_); batch,\r\nbake, &c. Sometimes an older form of the substantive survives, as in the\r\nElizabethan and Northern _make_ = _mate_ alongside _match_.     (P.

It is a peak of the Karakoram extension of the\r\nMuztagh range dividing Kashmir from Chinese Turkestan. The height of K2\r\nas at present determined by triangulation is 28,250 ft., but it is\r\npossible that an ultimate revision of the values of refraction at high\r\naltitudes may have the effect of lowering the height of K2, while it\r\nwould elevate those of Everest and Kinchinjunga. The latter mountain\r\nwould then rank second, and K2 third, in the scale of altitude, Everest\r\nalways maintaining its ascendancy. K2 was ascended for the first time by\r\nthe duke of the Abruzzi in June 1909, being the highest elevation on the\r\nearth's surface ever reached by man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKA'BA, KAABA, or KAABEH, the sacred shrine of Mahommedanism, containing\r\nthe \"black stone,\" in the middle of the great mosque at Mecca (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKABARDIA, a territory of S. Russia, now part of the province of Terek.\r\nIt is divided into Great and Little Kabardia by the upper river Terek,\r\nand covers 3780 sq. m. on the northern slopes of the Caucasus range\r\n(from Mount Elbruz to Pasis-mta, or Edena), including the Black\r\nMountains (Kara-dagh) and the high plains on their northern slope.\r\nBefore the Russian conquest it extended as far as the Sea of Azov. Its\r\npopulation is now about 70,000. One-fourth of the territory is owned by\r\nthe aristocracy and the remainder is divided among the _auls_ or\r\nvillages. A great portion is under permanent pasture, part under\r\nforests, and some under perpetual snow. Excellent breeds of horses are\r\nreared, and the peasants own many cattle. The land is well cultivated in\r\nthe lower parts, the chief crops being millet, maize, wheat and oats.\r\nBee-keeping is extensively practised, and Kabardian honey is in repute.\r\nWood-cutting and the manufacture of wooden wares, the making of _burkas_\r\n(felt and fur cloaks), and saddlery are very general. Nalchik is the\r\nchief town.\r\n\r\nThe Kabardians are a branch of the Adyghe (Circassians). The policy of\r\nRussia was always to be friendly with the Kabardian aristocracy, who\r\nwere possessed of feudal rights over the Ossetes, the Ingushes, the\r\nAbkhasians and the mountain Tatars, and had command of the roads leading\r\ninto Transcaucasia. Ivan the Terrible took Kabardia under his protection\r\nin the 16th century. Later, Russian influence was counterbalanced by\r\nthat of the Crimean khans, but the Kabardian nobles nevertheless\r\nsupported Peter the Great during his Caucasian campaign in 1722-23. In\r\n1739 Kabardia was recognized as being under the double protectorate of\r\nRussia and Turkey, but thirty-five years later it was definitively\r\nannexed to Russia, and risings of the population in 1804 and 1822 were\r\ncruelly suppressed. Kabardia is considered as a school of good manners\r\nin Caucasia; the Kabardian dress sets the fashion to all the\r\nmountaineers. Kabardians constitute the best detachment of the personal\r\nImperial Guards at St Petersburg.\r\n\r\n  A short grammar of the Kabardian language and a Russian-Kabardian\r\n  dictionary, by Lopatinsky, were published in _Sbornik Materialov dla\r\n  Opisaniya Kavkaza_ (vol. xii., Tiflis, 1891). Fragments of the poem\r\n  \"Sosyruko,\" some Persian tales, and the tenets of the Mussulman\r\n  religion were printed in Kabardian in 1864, by Kazi Atazhukin and\r\n  Shardanov. The common law of the Kabardians has been studied by Maxim\r\n  Kovalevsky and Vsevolod Miller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKABBA, a province of the British protectorate of Northern Nigeria,\r\nsituated chiefly on the right bank of the Niger, between 7 deg. 5' and 8\r\ndeg. 45' N. and 5 deg. 30' and 7 deg. E. It has an area of 7800 sq. m.\r\nand an estimated population of about 70,000. The province consists of\r\nrelatively healthy uplands interspersed with fertile valleys. It formed\r\npart at one time of the Nupe emirate, and under Fula rule the armies of\r\nBida regularly raided for slaves and laid waste the country. Amongst the\r\nnative inhabitants the Igbira are very industrious, and crops of\r\ntobacco, indigo, all the African grains, and a good quantity of cotton\r\nare already grown. The sylvan products are valuable and include palm\r\noil, kolas, shea and rubber. Lokoja, a town which up to 1902 was the\r\nprincipal British station in the protectorate, is situated in this\r\nprovince. The site of Lokoja, with a surrounding tract of country at the\r\njunction of the Benue and the Niger, was ceded to the British government\r\nin 1841 by the _attah_ of Idah, whose dominions at that time extended to\r\nthe right bank of the river. The first British settlement was a failure.\r\nIn 1854 MacGregor Laird, who had taken an active part in promoting the\r\nexploration of the river, sent thither Dr W. B. Baikie, who was\r\nsuccessful in dealing with the natives and in 1857 became the first\r\nBritish consul in the interior. The town of Lokoja was founded by him in\r\n1860. In 1868 the consulate was abolished and the settlement was left\r\nwholly to commercial interests. In 1879 Sir George Goldie formed the\r\nRoyal Niger Company, which bought out its foreign rivals and acquired a\r\ncharter from the British government. In 1886 the company made Lokoja its\r\nmilitary centre, and on the transfer of the company's territories to the\r\nCrown it remained for a time the capital of Northern Nigeria. In 1902\r\nthe political capital of the protectorate was shifted to Zungeru in the\r\nprovince of Zaria, but Lokoja remains the commercial centre. The\r\ndistance of Lokoja from the sea at the Niger mouth is about 250 m.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any central native authority the province is entirely\r\ndependent for administration upon British initiative. It has been\r\ndivided into four administrative divisions. British and native courts of\r\njustice have been established. A British station has been established at\r\nKabba town, which is an admirable site some 50 m. W. by N. of Lokoja,\r\nabout 1300 ft. above the sea, and a good road has been made from Kabba\r\nto Lokoja. Roads have been opened through the province. (See NIGERIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKABBABISH (\"goatherds\": James Bruce derives the name from _Hebsh_,\r\nsheep), a tribe of African nomads of Semitic origin. It is perhaps the\r\nlargest \"Arab\" tribe in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and its many clans are\r\nscattered over the country extending S.W. from the province of Dongola\r\nto the confines of Darfur. The Kabbabish speak Arabic, but their\r\npronunciation differs much from that of the true Arabs. The Kabbabish\r\nhave a tradition that they came from Tunisia and are of Mogrebin or\r\nwestern descent; but while the chiefs look like Arabs, the tribesmen\r\nresemble the Beja family. They themselves declare that one of their\r\nclans, Kawahla, is not of Kabbabish blood, but was affiliated to them\r\nlong ago. Kawahla is a name of Arab formation, and J. L. Burckhardt\r\nspoke of the clan as a distinct one living about Abu Haraz and on the\r\nAtbara. The Kabbabish probably received Arab rulers, as did the Ababda.\r\nThey are chiefly employed in cattle, camel and sheep breeding, and\r\nbefore the Sudan wars of 1883-99 they had a monopoly of all transport\r\nfrom the Nile, north of Abu Gussi, to Kordofan. They also cultivate the\r\nlowlands which border the Nile, where they have permanent villages. They\r\nare of fine physique, dark with black wiry hair, carefully arranged in\r\ntightly rolled curls which cling to the head, with regular features and\r\nrather thick aquiline noses. Some of the tribes wear large hats like\r\nthose of the Kabyles of Algeria and Tunisia.\r\n\r\n  See James Bruce, _Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile_ (1790);\r\n  A. H. Keane, _Ethnology of Egyptian Sudan_ (1884); _Anglo-Egyptian\r\n  Sudan_ (edited by Count Gleichen, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKABBALAH (late Hebrew _kabbalah_, _qabbalah_), the technical name for\r\nthe system of Jewish theosophy which played an important part in the\r\nChristian Church in the middle ages. The term primarily denotes\r\n\"reception\" and then \"doctrines received by tradition.\" In the older\r\nJewish literature the name is applied to the whole body of received\r\nreligious doctrine with the exception of the Pentateuch, thus including\r\nthe Prophets and Hagiographa as well as the oral traditions ultimately\r\nembodied in the Mishnah.[1] It is only since the 11th or 12th century\r\nthat Kabbalah has become the exclusive appellation for the renowned\r\nsystem of theosophy which claims to have been transmitted\r\nuninterruptedly by the mouths of the patriarchs and prophets ever since\r\nthe creation of the first man.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Doctrine of the Sephiroth.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal doctrines of the Kabbalah embrace the nature of the Deity,\r\nthe Divine emanations or _Sephiroth_, the cosmogony, the creation of\r\nangels and man, their destiny, and the import of the revealed law.\r\nAccording to this esoteric doctrine, God, who is boundless, and above\r\neverything, even above being and thinking, is called _En Soph_ ([Greek:\r\napeiros]); He is the space of the universe containing [Greek: to pan],\r\nbut the universe is not his space. In this boundlessness He could not be\r\ncomprehended by the intellect or described in words, and as such the En\r\nSoph was in a certain sense _Ayin_, non-existent (_Zohar_, iii. 283).[2]\r\nTo make his existence known and comprehensible, the En Soph had to\r\nbecome active and creative. As creation involves intention, desire,\r\nthought and work, and as these are properties which imply limit and\r\nbelong to a finite being, and moreover as the imperfect and\r\ncircumscribed nature of this creation precludes the idea of its being\r\nthe direct work of the infinite and perfect, the En Soph had to become\r\ncreative, through the medium of ten Sephiroth or intelligences, which\r\nemanated from him like rays proceeding from a luminary.\r\n\r\nNow the wish to become manifest and known, and hence the idea of\r\ncreation, is co-eternal with the inscrutable Deity, and the first\r\nmanifestation of this primordial will is called the first _Sephirah_ or\r\nemanation. This first Sephirah, this spiritual substance which existed\r\nin the En Soph from all eternity, contained nine other intelligences or\r\n_Sephiroth_. These again emanated one from the other, the second from\r\nthe first, the third from the second, and so on up to ten.\r\n\r\n  The ten Sephiroth, which form among themselves and with the En Soph a\r\n  strict unity, and which simply represent different aspects of one and\r\n  the same being, are respectively denominated (1) the Crown, (2)\r\n  Wisdom, (3) Intelligence, (4) Love, (5) Justice, (6) Beauty, (7)\r\n  Firmness, (8) Splendour, (9) Foundation, and (10) Kingdom. Their\r\n  evolution was as follows: \"When the Holy Aged, the concealed of all\r\n  concealed, assumed a form, he produced everything in the form of male\r\n  and female, as things could not continue in any other form. Hence\r\n  Wisdom, the second Sephirah, and the beginning of development, when it\r\n  proceeded from the Holy Aged (another name of the first Sephirah)\r\n  emanated in male and female, for Wisdom expanded, and Intelligence,\r\n  the third Sephirah, proceeded from it, and thus were obtained male and\r\n  female, viz. Wisdom the father and Intelligence the mother, from whose\r\n  union the other pairs of Sephiroth successively emanated\" (_Zohar_,\r\n  iii. 290). These two opposite potencies, viz. the masculine Wisdom or\r\n  Sephirah No. 2 and the feminine Intelligence or Sephirah No. 3 are\r\n  joined together by the first potency, the Crown or Sephirah No. 1;\r\n  they yield the first triad of the Sephiric decade, and constitute the\r\n  divine head of the archetypal man.\r\n\r\n  From the junction of Sephiroth Nos. 2 and 3 emanated the masculine\r\n  potency Love or Mercy (4) and the feminine potency Justice (5), and\r\n  from the junction of the latter two emanated again the uniting potency\r\n  Beauty (6). Beauty, the sixth Sephirah, constitutes the chest in the\r\n  archetypal man, and unites Love (4) and Justice (5), which constitute\r\n  the divine arms, thus yielding the second triad of the Sephiric\r\n  decade. From this second conjunction emanated again the masculine\r\n  potency Firmness (7) and the feminine potency Splendour (8), which\r\n  constitute the divine legs of the archetypal man; and these sent forth\r\n  Foundation (9), which is the genital organ and medium of union between\r\n  them, thus yielding the third triad in the Sephiric decade. Kingdom\r\n  (10), which emanated from the ninth Sephirah, encircles all the other\r\n  nine, inasmuch as it is the Shechinah, the divine halo, which\r\n  encompasses the whole by its all-glorious presence.\r\n\r\nIn their totality and unity the ten Sephiroth are not only denominated\r\nthe World of Sephiroth, or the World of Emanations, but, owing to the\r\nabove representation, are called the primordial or archetypal man (=\r\n[Greek: protogonos]) and the heavenly man. It is this form which, as we\r\nare assured, the prophet Ezekiel saw in the mysterious chariot (Ezek. i.\r\n1-28), and of which the earthly man is a faint copy.\r\n\r\nAs the three triads respectively represent intellectual, moral and\r\nphysical qualities, the first is called the Intellectual, the second the\r\nMoral or Sensuous, and the third the Material World. According to this\r\ntheory of the archetypal man the three Sephiroth on the right-hand side\r\nare masculine and represent the principle of rigour, the three on the\r\nleft are feminine and represent the principle of mercy, and the four\r\ncentral or uniting Sephiroth represent the principle of mildness. Hence\r\nthe right is called \"the Pillar of Judgment,\" the left \"the Pillar of\r\nMercy,\" and the centre \"the Middle Pillar.\" The middle Sephiroth are\r\nsynecdochically used to represent the worlds or triads of which they are\r\nthe uniting potencies. Hence the Crown, the first Sephirah, which unites\r\nWisdom and Intelligence to constitute the first triad, is by itself\r\ndenominated the Intellectual World. So Beauty is by itself described as\r\nthe Sensuous World, and in this capacity is called the Sacred King or\r\nsimply the King, whilst Kingdom, the tenth Sephirah, which unites all\r\nthe nine Sephiroth, is used to denote the Material World, and as such is\r\ndenominated the Queen or the Matron. Thus a trinity of units, viz. the\r\nCrown, Beauty and Kingdom, is obtained within the trinity of triads. But\r\nfurther, each Sephirah is as it were a trinity in itself. It (1) has its\r\nown absolute character, (2) receives from above, and (3) communicates to\r\nwhat is below. \"Just as the Sacred Aged is represented by the number\r\nthree, so are all the other lights (Sephiroth) of a threefold nature\"\r\n(_Zohar_, iii. 288). In this all-important doctrine of the Sephiroth,\r\nthe Kabbalah insists upon the fact that these potencies are not\r\ncreations of the En Soph, which would be a diminution of strength; that\r\nthey form among themselves and with the En Soph a strict unity, and\r\nsimply represent different aspects of the same being, just as the\r\ndifferent rays which proceed from the light, and which appear different\r\nthings to the eye, are only different manifestations of one and the same\r\nlight; that for this reason they all alike partake of the perfections of\r\nthe En Soph; and that as emanations from the Infinite, the Sephiroth are\r\ninfinite and perfect like the En Soph, and yet constitute the first\r\nfinite things. They are infinite and perfect when the En Soph imparts\r\nhis fullness to them, and finite and imperfect when that fullness is\r\nwithdrawn from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Universe.\r\n\r\nThe conjunction of the Sephiroth, or, according to the language of the\r\nKabbalah, the union of the crowned King and Queen, produced the universe\r\nin their own image. Worlds came into existence before the En Soph\r\nmanifested himself in the human form of emanations, but they could not\r\ncontinue, and necessarily perished because the conditions of development\r\nwhich obtained with the sexual opposites of the Sephiroth did not exist.\r\nThese worlds which perished are compared to sparks which fly out from a\r\nred-hot iron beaten by a hammer, and which are extinguished according to\r\nthe distance they are removed from the burning mass. Creation is not\r\n_ex nihilo_; it is simply a further expansion or evolution of the\r\nSephiroth.[3] The world reveals and makes visible the Boundless and the\r\nconcealed of the concealed. And, though it exhibits the Deity in less\r\nsplendour than its Sephiric parents exhibit the En Soph, because it is\r\nfarther removed from the primordial source of light than the Sephiroth,\r\nstill, as it is God manifested, all the multifarious forms in the world\r\npoint out the unity which they represent. Hence nothing in the whole\r\nuniverse can be annihilated. Everything, spirit as well as body, must\r\nreturn to the source whence it emanated (_Zohar_, ii. 218). The universe\r\nconsists of four different worlds, each of which forms a separate\r\nSephiric system of a decade of emanations.\r\n\r\n  They were evolved in the following order. (1) The World Of Emanations,\r\n  also called the Image and the Heavenly or Archetypal Man, is, as we\r\n  have seen, a direct emanation from the En Soph. Hence it is most\r\n  intimately allied to the Deity, and is perfect and immutable. From the\r\n  conjunction of the King and Queen (i.e. these ten Sephiroth) is\r\n  produced (2) the World of Creation, or the Briatic world, also called\r\n  \"the Throne.\" Its ten Sephiroth, being farther removed from the En\r\n  Soph, are of a more limited and circumscribed potency, though the\r\n  substances they comprise are of the purest nature and without any\r\n  admixture of matter. The angel Metatron inhabits this world. He alone\r\n  constitutes the world of pure spirit, and is the garment of Shaddai,\r\n  i.e. the visible manifestation of the Deity. His name is numerically\r\n  equivalent to that of the Lord (_Zohar_, iii. 231). He governs the\r\n  visible world, preserves the harmony and guides the revolutions of all\r\n  the spheres, and is the captain of all the myriads of angelic beings.\r\n  This Briatic world again gave rise to (3) the World of Formation, or\r\n  Yetziratic World. Its ten Sephiroth, being still farther removed from\r\n  the Primordial Source, are of a less refined substance. Still they are\r\n  yet without matter. It is the abode of the angels, who are wrapped in\r\n  luminous garments, and who assume a sensuous form when they appear to\r\n  men. The myriads of the angelic hosts who people this world are\r\n  divided into ten ranks, answering to the ten Sephiroth, and each one\r\n  of these numerous angels is set over a different part of the universe,\r\n  and derives his name from the heavenly body or element which he guards\r\n  (_Zohar_, i. 42). From this world finally emanated (4) the World of\r\n  Action, also called the World of Matter. Its ten Sephiroth are made up\r\n  of the grosser elements of the former three worlds; they consist of\r\n  material substance limited by space and perceptible to the senses in a\r\n  multiplicity of forms. This world is subject to constant changes and\r\n  corruption, and is the dwelling of the evil spirits. These, the\r\n  grossest and most deficient of all forms, are also divided into ten\r\n  degrees, each lower than the other. The first two are nothing more\r\n  than the absence of all visible form and organization; the third\r\n  degree is the abode of darkness; whilst the remaining seven are \"the\r\n  seven infernal halls,\" occupied by the demons, who are the incarnation\r\n  of all human vices. These seven hells are subdivided into innumerable\r\n  compartments corresponding to every species of sin, where the demons\r\n  torture the poor deluded human beings who have suffered themselves to\r\n  be led astray whilst on earth. The prince of this region of darkness\r\n  is Samael, the evil spirit, the serpent who seduced Eve. His wife is\r\n  the Harlot or the Woman of Whoredom. The two are treated as one\r\n  person, and are called \"the Beast\" (_Zohar_, ii. 255-259, with i. 35).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Doctrine of Man.\r\n\r\nThe whole universe, however, was incomplete, and did not receive its\r\nfinishing stroke till man was formed, who is the acme of the creation\r\nand the microcosm. \"The heavenly Adam (i.e. the ten Sephiroth) who\r\nemanated from the highest primordial obscurity (i.e. the En Soph)\r\ncreated the earthly Adam\" (_Zohar_, ii. 70). \"Man is both the import and\r\nthe highest degree of creation, for which reason he was formed on the\r\nsixth day. As soon as man was created everything was complete, including\r\nthe upper and nether worlds, for everything is comprised in man. He\r\nunites in himself all forms\" (_Zohar_, iii. 48). Each member of his body\r\ncorresponds to a part of the visible universe. \"Just as we see in the\r\nfirmament above, covering all things, different signs which are formed\r\nof the stars and the planets, and which contain secret things and\r\nprofound mysteries studied by those who are wise and expert in these\r\nthings; so there are in the skin, which is the cover of the body of the\r\nson of man, and which is like the sky that covers all things above,\r\nsigns and features which are the stars and planets of the skin,\r\nindicating secret things and profound mysteries whereby the wise are\r\nattracted who understand the reading of the mysteries in the human\r\nface\" (_Zohar_, ii. 76). The human form is shaped after the four letters\r\nwhich constitute the Jewish Tetragrammaton (q.v.; see also JEHOVAH). The\r\nhead is in the shape of [Hebrew: iod], the arms and the shoulders are\r\nlike [Hebrew: hei], the breast like [Hebrew: vav], and the two legs with\r\nthe back again resemble [Hebrew: hei] (_Zohar_, ii. 72). The souls of\r\nthe whole human race pre-exist in the World of Emanations, and are all\r\ndestined to inhabit human bodies. Like the Sephiroth from which it\r\nemanates, every soul has ten potencies, consisting of a trinity of\r\ntriads. (1) The Spirit (_neshamah_), which is the highest degree of\r\nbeing, corresponds to and is operated upon by the Crown, which is the\r\nhighest triad in the Sephiroth, and is called the Intellectual World;\r\n(2) the Soul (_ruah_), which is the seat of the moral qualities,\r\ncorresponds to and is operated upon by Beauty, which is the second triad\r\nin the Sephiroth, and is called the Moral World; and (3) the Cruder Soul\r\n(_nephesh_), which is immediately connected with the body, and is the\r\ncause of its lower instincts and the animal life, corresponds to and is\r\noperated upon by Foundation, the third triad in the Sephiroth, called\r\nthe Material World. Each soul prior to its entering into this world\r\nconsists of male and female united into one being. When it descends on\r\nthis earth the two parts are separated and animate two different bodies.\r\n\"At the time of marriage the Holy One, blessed be he, who knows all\r\nsouls and spirits, unites them again as they were before; and they again\r\nconstitute one body and one soul, forming as it were the right and the\r\nleft of the individual.... This union, however, is influenced by the\r\ndeeds of the man and by the ways in which he walks. If the man is pure\r\nand his conduct is pleasing in the sight of God, he is united with that\r\nfemale part of the soul which was his component part prior to his birth\"\r\n(_Zohar_, i. 91). The soul's destiny upon earth is to develop those\r\nperfections the germs of which are eternally implanted in it, and it\r\nultimately must return to the infinite source from which it emanated.\r\nHence, if, after assuming a body and sojourning upon earth, it becomes\r\npolluted by sin and fails to acquire the experience for which it\r\ndescends from heaven, it must three times reinhabit a body, till it is\r\nable to ascend in a purified state through repeated trials. If, after\r\nits third residence in a human body, it is still too weak to withstand\r\nthe contamination of sin, it is united with another soul, in order that\r\nby their combined efforts it may resist the pollution which by itself it\r\nwas unable to conquer. When the whole pleroma of pre-existent souls in\r\nthe world of the Sephiroth shall have descended and occupied human\r\nbodies and have passed their period of probation and have returned\r\npurified to the bosom of the infinite Source, then the soul of Messiah\r\nwill descend from the region of souls; then the great Jubilee will\r\ncommence. There shall be no more sin, no more temptation, no more\r\nsuffering. Universal restoration will take place. Satan himself, \"the\r\nvenomous Beast,\" will be restored to his angelic nature. Life will be an\r\neverlasting feast, a Sabbath without end. All souls will be united with\r\nthe Highest Soul, and will supplement each other in the Holy of Holies\r\nof the Seven Halls (_Zohar_, i. 45, 168; ii. 97).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Antiquity and Influence of Kabbalah.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Kabbalah all these esoteric doctrines are contained in\r\nthe Hebrew Scriptures. The uninitiated cannot perceive them; but they\r\nare plainly revealed to the spiritually minded, who discern the profound\r\nimport of this theosophy beneath the surface of the letters and words of\r\nHoly Writ. \"If the law simply consists of ordinary expressions and\r\nnarratives, such as the words of Esau, Hagar, Laban, the ass of Balaam\r\nor Balaam himself, why should it be called the law of truth, the perfect\r\nlaw, the true witness of God? Each word contains a sublime source, each\r\nnarrative points not only to the single instance in question, but also\r\nto generals\" (_Zohar_, iii. 149, cf. 152).\r\n\r\n  To obtain these heavenly mysteries, which alone make the Torah\r\n  superior to profane codes, definite hermeneutical rules are employed,\r\n  of which the following are the most important. (1) The words of\r\n  several verses in the Hebrew Scriptures which are regarded as\r\n  containing a recondite sense are placed over each other, and the\r\n  letters are formed into new words by reading them vertically. (2) The\r\n  words of the text are ranged in squares in such a manner as to be read\r\n  either vertically or boustrophedon. (3) The words are joined together\r\n  and redivided. (4) The initials and final letters of several words are\r\n  formed into separate words. (5) Every letter of a word is reduced to\r\n  its numerical value, and the word is explained by another of the same\r\n  quantity. (6) Every letter of a word is taken to be the initial or\r\n  abbreviation of a word. (7) The twenty-two letters of the alphabet are\r\n  divided into two halves; one half is placed above the other; and the\r\n  two letters which thus become associated are interchanged. By this\r\n  permutation, _Aleph_, the first letter of the alphabet, becomes\r\n  _Lamed_, the twelfth letter; _Beth_ becomes _Mem_, and so on. This\r\n  cipher alphabet is called _Albam_, from the first interchangeable\r\n  pairs. (8) The commutation of the twenty-two letters is effected by\r\n  the last letter of the alphabet taking the place of the first, the\r\n  last but one the place of the second, and so forth. This cipher is\r\n  called _Atbash_. These hermeneutical canons are much older than the\r\n  Kabbalah. They obtained in the synagogue from time immemorial, and\r\n  were used by the Christian fathers in the interpretation of\r\n  Scripture.[4] Thus Canon V., according to which a word is reduced to\r\n  its numerical value and interpreted by another word of the same value,\r\n  is recognized in the New Testament (cf. Rev. xiii. 18). Canon VI. is\r\n  adopted by Irenaeus, who tells us that, according to the learned among\r\n  the Hebrews, the name Jesus contains two letters and a half, and\r\n  signifies that Lord who contains heaven and earth [[Hebrew: ieshu] =\r\n  [Hebrew: ieova shamaim vaaretz]] (_Against Heresies_, ii. xxiv., i.\r\n  205, ed. Clark). The cipher _Atbash_ (Canon VIII.) is used in Jeremiah\r\n  xxv. 26, li. 41, where Sheshach is written for Babel. In Jer. li. 1,\r\n  [Hebrew: lev kamai], _Leb-Kamai_ (\"the heart of them that rise up\r\n  against me\"), is written for [Hebrew: kasdim], _Chaldea_, by the same\r\n  rule.\r\n\r\nExegesis of this sort is not the characteristic of any single circle,\r\npeople or century; unscientific methods of biblical interpretation have\r\nprevailed from Philo's treatment of the Pentateuch to modern apologetic\r\ninterpretations of Genesis, ch. i.[5] The Kabbalah itself is but an\r\nextreme and remarkable development of certain forms of thought which had\r\nnever been absent from Judaism; it is bound up with earlier tendencies\r\nto mysticism, with man's inherent striving to enter into communion with\r\nthe Deity. To seek its sources would be futile. The Pythagorean theory\r\nof numbers, Neoplatonic ideas of emanation, the Logos, the personified\r\nWisdom, Gnosticism--these and many other features combine to show the\r\nantiquity of tendencies which, clad in other shapes, are already found\r\nin the old pre-Christian Oriental religions.[6] In its more mature form\r\nthe Kabbalah belongs to the period when medieval Christian mysticism was\r\nbeginning to manifest itself (viz. in Eckhart, towards end of 13th\r\ncentury); it is an age which also produced the rationalism of Maimonides\r\n(q.v.). Although some of its foremost exponents were famous Talmudists,\r\nit was a protest against excessive intellectualism and Aristotelian\r\nscholasticism. It laid stress, not on external authority, as did the\r\nJewish law, but on individual experience and inward meditation. \"The\r\nmystics accorded the first place to prayer, which was considered as a\r\nmystical progress towards God, demanding a state of ecstasy.\"[7] As a\r\nresult, some of the finest specimens of Jewish devotional literature and\r\nsome of the best types of Jewish individual character have been\r\nKabbalist.[8] On the other hand, the Kabbalah has been condemned, and\r\nnowhere more strongly than among the Jews themselves. Jewish orthodoxy\r\nfound itself attacked by the more revolutionary aspects of mysticism and\r\nits tendencies to alter established customs. While the medieval\r\nscholasticism denied the possibility of knowing anything unattainable by\r\nreason, the spirit of the Kabbalah held that the Deity could be\r\nrealized, and it sought to bridge the gulf. Thus it encouraged an\r\nunrestrained emotionalism, rank superstition, an unhealthy asceticism,\r\nand the employment of artificial means to induce the ecstatic state.\r\nThat this brought moral laxity was a stronger reason for condemning the\r\nKabbalah, and the evil effects of nervous degeneration find a more\r\nrecent illustration in the mysticism of the Chasidim (_Hasidim_,\r\n\"saints\"), a Jewish sect in eastern Europe which started from a movement\r\nin the 18th century against the exaggerated casuistry of contemporary\r\nrabbis, and combined much that was spiritual and beautiful with extreme\r\nemotionalism and degradation.[9] The appearance of the Kabbalah and of\r\nother forms of mysticism in Judaism may seem contrary to ordinary and\r\nnarrow conceptions of orthodox Jewish legalism. Its interest lies, not\r\nin its doctrines, which have often been absurdly over-estimated\r\n(particularly among Christians), but in its contribution to the study of\r\nhuman thought. It supplied a want which has always been felt by certain\r\ntypes, and it became a movement which had mischievous effects upon\r\nill-balanced minds. As usual, the excessive self-introspection was not\r\nchecked by a rational criticism; the individual was guided by his own\r\nreason, the limitations of which he did not realize; and in becoming a\r\nlaw unto himself he ignored the accumulated experiences of civilized\r\nhumanity.[10]\r\n\r\nA feature of greater interest is the extraordinary part which this\r\ntheosophy played in the Christian Church, especially at the time of the\r\nRenaissance. We have already seen that the Sephiric decade or the\r\narchetypal man, like Christ, is considered to be of a double nature,\r\nboth infinite and finite, perfect and imperfect. More distinct, however,\r\nis the doctrine of the Trinity. In Deut. vi. 43, where Yahweh occurs\r\nfirst, then Elohenu, and then again Yahweh, we are told \"The voice\r\nthough one, consists of three elements, fire (i.e. warmth), air (i.e.\r\nbreath), and water (i.e. humidity), yet all three are one in the mystery\r\nof the voice and can only be one. Thus also Yahweh, Elohenu, Yahweh,\r\nconstitute one--three forms which are one\" (_Zohar_, ii. 43; compare\r\niii. 65). Discussing the thrice holy in Isaiah vi. 3, one codex of the\r\n_Zohar_ had the following remark: \"The first holy denotes the Holy\r\nFather, the second the Holy Son, and the third the Holy Ghost\" (cf.\r\nGalatinus, _De arcanis cathol._ lib. ii. c. 3, p. 31; Wolf, _Bibliotheca\r\nhebraica_, i. 1136). Still more distinct is the doctrine of the\r\natonement. \"The Messiah invokes all the sufferings, pain, and\r\nafflictions of Israel to come upon Him. Now if He did not remove them\r\nthus and take them upon Himself, no man could endure the sufferings of\r\nIsrael, due as their punishment for transgressing the law; as it is\r\nwritten (Isa. liii. 4), Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our\r\nsorrows\" (_Zohar_, ii. 12). These and similar statements favouring the\r\ndoctrines of the New Testament made many Kabbalists of the highest\r\nposition in the synagogue embrace the Christian faith and write\r\nelaborate books to win their Jewish brethren over to Christ. As early as\r\n1450 a company of Jewish converts in Spain, at the head of which were\r\nPaul de Heredia, Vidal de Saragossa de Aragon, and Davila, published\r\ncompilations of Kabbalistic treatises to prove from them the doctrines\r\nof Christianity. They were followed by Paul Rici, professor at Pavia,\r\nand physician to the emperor Maximilian I. Among the best-known\r\nnon-Jewish exponents of the Kabbalah were the Italian count Pico di\r\nMirandola (1463-1494), the renowned Johann Reuchlin (1455-1522),\r\nHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim (1487-1535), Theophrastus\r\nParacelsus (1493-1541), and, later, the Englishman Robert Fludd\r\n(1574-1637). Prominent among the \"nine hundred theses\" which Mirandola\r\nhad placarded in Rome, and which he undertook to defend in the presence\r\nof all European scholars, whom he invited to the Eternal City, promising\r\nto defray their travelling expenses, was the following: \"No science\r\nyields greater proof of the divinity of Christ than magic and the\r\nKabbalah.\" Mirandola so convinced Pope Sixtus of the paramount\r\nimportance of the Kabbalah as an auxiliary to Christianity that his\r\nholiness exerted himself to have Kabbalistic writings translated into\r\nLatin for the use of divinity students. With equal zeal did Reuchlin act\r\nas the apostle of the Kabbalah. His treatises exercised an almost magic\r\ninfluence upon the greatest thinkers of the time. Pope Leo X. and the\r\nearly Reformers were alike captivated by the charms of the Kabbalah as\r\npropounded by Reuchlin, and not only divines, but statesmen and\r\nwarriors, began to study the Oriental languages in order to be able to\r\nfathom the mysteries of Jewish theosophy. The _Zohar_, that farrago of\r\nabsurdity and spiritual devotion, was the weapon with which these\r\nChristians defended Jewish literature against hostile ecclesiastic\r\nbodies (Abrahams, _Jew. Lit._ p. 106). Thus the Kabbalah linked the old\r\nscholasticism with the new and independent inquiries in learning and\r\nphilosophy after the Renaissance, and although it had evolved a\r\nremarkably bizarre conception of the universe, it partly anticipated, in\r\nits own way, the scientific study of natural philosophy.[11] Jewish\r\ntheosophy, then, with its good and evil tendencies, and with its varied\r\nresults, may thus claim to have played no unimportant part in the\r\nhistory of European scholarship and thought.\r\n\r\n  The main sources to be noticed are:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Main Sources.\r\n\r\n  1. The _Sepher Yesirah_, or \"book of creation,\" not the old Hilkoth Y.\r\n  (\"rules of creation\"), which belongs to the Talmudic period (on which\r\n  see Kohler, _Jew. Ency._ xii. 602 seq.), but a later treatise, a\r\n  combination of medieval natural philosophy and mysticism. It has been\r\n  variously ascribed to the patriarch Abraham and to the illustrious\r\n  rabbi 'Aqiba; its essential elements, however, maybe of the 3rd or 4th\r\n  century A.D., and it is apparently earlier than the 9th (see L.\r\n  Ginzberg, _op. cit._ 603 sqq.). It has \"had a greater influence on the\r\n  development of the Jewish mind than almost any other book after the\r\n  completion of the Talmud\" (ibid.).\r\n\r\n  2. The _Bahir_ (\"brilliant,\" Job. xxxvii. 21), though ascribed to\r\n  Nehunyah b. Haqqanah (1st century A.D.), is first quoted by\r\n  Nahmanides, and is now attributed to his teacher Ezra or Azriel\r\n  (1160-1238). It shows the influence of the _Sepher Yesirah_, is marked\r\n  by the teaching of a celestial Trinity, is a rough outline of what the\r\n  _Zohar_ was destined to be, and gave the first opening to a thorough\r\n  study of metaphysics among the Jews. (See further 1. Broyde, _Jew.\r\n  Ency._ ii. 442 seq.).\r\n\r\n  3. The _Zohar_ (\"shining,\" Dan. xii. 3) is a commentary on the\r\n  Pentateuch, according to its division into fifty-two hebdomadal\r\n  lessons. It begins with the exposition of Gen. i. 4 (\"let there be\r\n  light\") and includes eleven dissertations: (1) \"Additions and\r\n  Supplements\"; (2) \"The Mansions and Abodes,\" describing the structure\r\n  of paradise and hell; (3) \"The Mysteries of the Pentateuch,\"\r\n  describing the evolution of the Sephiroth, &c.; (4) \"The Hidden\r\n  Interpretation,\" deducing esoteric doctrine from the narratives in the\r\n  Pentateuch; (5) \"The Faithful Shepherd,\" recording discussions between\r\n  Moses the faithful shepherd, the prophet Elijah and R. Simon b. Yohai,\r\n  the reputed compiler of the _Zohar_; (6) \"The Secret of Secrets,\" a\r\n  treatise on physiognomy and psychology; (7) \"The Aged,\" i.e. the\r\n  prophet Elijah, discoursing with R. Simon on the doctrine of\r\n  transmigration as evolved from Exod. xxi. 1-xxiv. 18; (8) \"The Book of\r\n  Secrets,\" discourses on cosmogony and demonology; (9) \"The Great\r\n  Assembly,\" discourses of R. Simon to his numerous assembly of\r\n  disciples on the form of the Deity and on pneumatology; (10) \"The\r\n  Young Man,\" discourses by young men of superhuman origin on the\r\n  mysteries of ablutions; and (11) \"The Small Assembly,\" containing the\r\n  discourses on the Sephiroth which R. Simon delivered to the small\r\n  congregation of six surviving disciples. The _Zohar_ pretends to be a\r\n  compilation made by Simon b. Yohai (the second century A.D.) of\r\n  doctrines which God communicated to Adam in Paradise, and which have\r\n  been received uninterruptedly from the mouths of the patriarchs and\r\n  prophets. It was discovered, so the story went, in a cavern in Galilee\r\n  where it had been hidden for a thousand years. Amongst the many facts,\r\n  however, established by modern criticism which prove the _Zohar_ to be\r\n  a compilation of the 13th century, are the following: (1) the _Zohar_\r\n  itself praises most fulsomely R. Simon, its reputed author, and exalts\r\n  him above Moses; (2) it mystically explains the Hebrew vowel points,\r\n  which did not obtain till 570; (3) the compiler borrows two verses\r\n  from the celebrated hymn called \"The Royal Diadem,\" written by Ibn\r\n  Gabirol, who was born about 1021; (4) it mentions the capture of\r\n  Jerusalem by the crusaders and the re-taking of the Holy City by the\r\n  Saracens; (5) it speaks of the comet which appeared at Rome, 15th July\r\n  1264, under the pontificate of Urban IV.; (6) by a slip the _Zohar_\r\n  assigns a reason why its contents were not revealed before 5060-5066\r\n  A.M., i.e. 1300-1306 A.D., (7) the doctrine of the En Soph and the\r\n  Sephiroth was not known before the 13th century; and (8) the very\r\n  existence of the _Zohar_ itself was not known prior to the 13th\r\n  century. Hence it is now believed that Moses de Leon (d. 1305), who\r\n  first circulated and sold the _Zohar_ as the production of R. Simon,\r\n  was himself the author or compiler. That eminent scholars both in the\r\n  synagogue and in the church should have been induced to believe in its\r\n  antiquity is owing to the fact that the _Zohar_ embodies many older\r\n  opinions and doctrines, and the undoubted antiquity of some of them\r\n  has served as a lever in the minds of these scholars to raise the late\r\n  speculations about the En Soph, the Sephiroth, &c., to the same age.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--The study of the whole subject being wrapped up with\r\n  Gnosticism and Oriental theosophy, the related literature is immense.\r\n  Among the more important works may be mentioned, Baron von Rosenroth's\r\n  _Kabbala Denudata_ (Sulzbach, 1677-1678; Frankfort, 1684); A.

Westwards it borders the Atlantic, N. and N.E.\r\nFrench Congo, S. and S.E. Belgian Congo. It has a coast-line of 93 m.,\r\nextends inland, at its greatest breadth, 70 m., and has an area of about\r\n3000 sq. m. In its physical features, flora, fauna and inhabitants, it\r\nresembles the coast region of French Congo (q.v.). The only considerable\r\nriver is the Chiloango, which in part forms the boundary between\r\nPortuguese and Belgian territory, and in its lower course divides\r\nKabinda into two fairly even portions. The mouth of the river is in 5\r\ndeg. 12' S., 12 deg. 5' E. The chief town, named Kabinda, is a seaport\r\non the right bank of the small river Bele, in 5 deg. 33' S., 12 deg. 10'\r\nE.; pop. about 10,000. From the beauty of its situation, and the\r\nfertility of the adjacent country, it has been called the paradise of\r\nthe coast. The harbour is sheltered and commodious, with anchorage in\r\nfour fathoms. Kabinda was formerly a noted slave mart. Farther north are\r\nthe ports of Landana and Massabi. Between Kabinda and Landana is Molembo\r\nat the head of a small bay of the same name. There is a considerable\r\ntrade in palm oil, ground nuts and other jungle produce, largely in the\r\nhands of British and German firms.\r\n\r\nThe possession of the enclave of Kabinda by Portugal is a result of the\r\nefforts made by that nation during the last quarter of the 19th century\r\nto obtain sovereignty over both banks of the lower Congo. Whilst\r\nPortugal succeeded in obtaining the southern bank of the river to the\r\nlimit of navigability from the sea, the northern bank became part of the\r\nCongo Free State (see AFRICA, S 5). Portuguese claims to the north of\r\nthe river were, however, to some extent met by the recognition of her\r\nright to Kabinda. The southernmost part of Kabinda is 25 m. (following\r\nthe coast-line) north of the mouth of the Congo. This district as far\r\nnorth as the Chiloango river (and including the adjacent territory of\r\nBelgian Congo) is sometimes spoken of as Kacongo. The name Loango (q.v.)\r\nwas also applied to this region as well as to the coast-lands\r\nimmediately to the north. Administratively Kabinda forms a division of\r\nthe Congo district of the province of Angola (q.v.). The inhabitants are\r\nBantu negroes who are called Kabindas. They are an intelligent,\r\nenergetic and enterprising people, daring sailors and active traders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKABIR, the most notable of the Vaishnava reformers of religion in\r\nnorthern India, who flourished during the first half of the 15th\r\ncentury. He is counted as one of the twelve disciples of Ramanand, the\r\ngreat preacher in the north (about A.D. 1400) of the doctrine of\r\n_bhakti_ addressed to Rama, which originated with Ramanuja (12th\r\ncentury) in southern India. He himself also mentions among his spiritual\r\nforerunners Jaideo and Namdeo (or Nama) the earliest Marathi poet (both\r\nabout 1250). Legend relates that Kabir was the son of a Brahman widow,\r\nby whom he was exposed, and was found on a lotus in Lahar Talao, a pond\r\nnear Benares, by a Musalman weaver named 'Ali (or Nuri), who with his\r\nwife Nima adopted him and brought him up in their craft as a Musalman.\r\nHe lived most of his life at Benares, and afterwards removed to Maghar\r\n(or Magahar), in the present district of Basti, where he is said to have\r\ndied in 1449. There appears to be no reason to doubt that he was\r\noriginally a Musalman and a weaver; his own name and that of his son\r\nKamal are Mahommedan, not Hindu. His adhesion to the doctrine of\r\nRamanand is not a solitary instance of the religious syncretism which\r\nprevailed at this time in northern India. The religion of the earlier\r\nSikh _Gurus_, which was largely based upon his teaching, also aimed at\r\nthe fusion of Hinduism and Islam; and the example of Malik Muhammad,[1]\r\nthe author of the Padmawat, who lived a century later than Kabir, shows\r\nthat the relations between the two creeds were in some cases extremely\r\nintimate. It is related that at Kabir's death the Hindus and Musalmans\r\neach claimed him as an adherent of their faith, and that when his\r\nfuneral issued forth from his house at Maghar the contention was only\r\nassuaged by the appearance of Kabir himself, who bade them look under\r\nthe cloth which covered the corpse, and immediately vanished. On raising\r\nthe cloth they found nothing but a heap of flowers. This was divided\r\nbetween the rival faiths, half being buried by the Musalmans and the\r\nother half burned by the Hindus.[2]\r\n\r\nKabir's fame as a preacher of _bhakti_, or enthusiastic devotion to a\r\npersonal God, whom he preferred to call by the Hindu names of Rama and\r\nHari, is greater than that of any other of the Vaishnava spiritual\r\nleaders. His fervent conviction of the truth and power of his doctrine,\r\nand the homely and searching expression given to it in his utterances,\r\nin the tongue of the people and not in a learned language remote from\r\ntheir understanding, won for him multitudes of adherents; and his sect,\r\nthe _Kabirpanthis_, is still one of the most numerous in northern India,\r\nits numbers exceeding a million. Its headquarters are the _Kabir Chaura_\r\nat Benares, where are preserved the works attributed to Kabir (called\r\nthe _Granth_), the greater part of which, however, were written by his\r\nimmediate disciples and their followers in his name.\r\n\r\n  Those works which seem to have the best claim to be considered his own\r\n  compositions are the _Sakhis_, or stanzas, some 5000 in number, which\r\n  have a very wide currency even among those who do not formally belong\r\n  to the sect, and the _Shabdawali_, consisting of a thousand \"words\"\r\n  (_shabd_), or short doctrinal expositions. Perhaps some of the\r\n  _Rekhtas_, or odes (100 in number), and of the _Ramainis_--brief\r\n  mystical poems in very obscure language--may also be from his hand. Of\r\n  these different forms specimens will be found translated in Professor\r\n  H. H. Wilson's _Sketch of the Religious Sects of the Hindus_, i.\r\n  79-90. Besides the followers who call themselves by Kabir's name,\r\n  there may be reckoned to him many other religious sects which bear\r\n  that of some intermediate _guru_ or master, but substantially concur\r\n  with Kabir in doctrine and practice. Such, for instance, are the\r\n  _Nanakshahis_ in the United Provinces, the Central Provinces, and\r\n  Bombay, and the _Dadu-panthis_, numerous in Rajputana (Wilson, _loc.\r\n  cit._ pp. 103 sqq.); the Sikhs, numbering two and a half millions in\r\n  the Panjab, are also his spiritual descendants, and their _Granth_ or\r\n  Scripture is largely stocked with texts drawn from his works.\r\n\r\nKabir taught the life of _bhakti_ (faith, or personal love and\r\ndevotion), the object of which is a _personal_ God, and not a\r\nphilosophical abstraction or an impersonal quality-less, all-pervading\r\nspiritual substance (as in the Vedanta of Sankaracharya). His utterances\r\ndo not, like those of Tulsi Das, dwell upon the incidents of the human\r\nlife of Rama, whom he takes as his type of the Supreme; nevertheless, it\r\nis the essence of his creed that God became incarnate to bring salvation\r\nto His children, mankind, and that the human mind of this incarnation\r\nstill subsists in the Divine Person. He proclaims the unity of the\r\nGodhead, the vanity of idols, the powerlessness of _brahmans_ or\r\n_mullas_ to guide or help, and the divine origin of the human soul,\r\n_divinae particula aurae_. All evil in the world is ascribed to _Maya_,\r\nillusion or falsehood, and truth in thought, word and deed is enjoined\r\nas the chief duty of man: \"No act of devotion can equal truth; no crime\r\nis so heinous as falsehood; in the heart where truth abides there is My\r\nabode.\"[3] The distinctions of creeds are declared to be of no\r\nimportance in the presence of God: \"The city of _Hara_[4] is to the\r\neast, that of '_Ali_[5] is to the west; but explore your own heart, for\r\nthere are both _Rama_ and _Karim_;\"[6] \"Behold but One in all things: it\r\nis the second that leads you astray. Every man and woman that has ever\r\nbeen born is of the same nature as yourself. _He_, whose is the world,\r\nand whose are the children of '_Ali_ and _Rama_, He is my _Guru_, He is\r\nmy _Pir_.\" He proclaims the universal brotherhood of man, and the duty\r\nof kindness to all living creatures. Life is the gift of God, and must\r\nnot be violated; the shedding of blood, whether of man or animals, is a\r\nheinous crime. The followers of Kabir do not observe celibacy, and live\r\nquiet unostentatious lives; Wilson (p. 97) compares them to Quakers for\r\ntheir hatred of violence and unobtrusive piety.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of many of Kabir's utterances to those of Christ, and\r\nespecially to the ideas set forth in St John's gospel, is very striking;\r\nstill more so is the existence in the ritual of the sect of a\r\nsacramental meal, involving the eating of a consecrated wafer and the\r\ndrinking of water administered by the _Mahant_ or spiritual superior,\r\nwhich bears a remarkable likeness to the Eucharist. Yet, though the\r\ndeities of Hinduism and the prophet of Islam are frequently mentioned in\r\nhis sayings, the name of Jesus has nowhere been found in them. It is\r\nconjectured that the doctrine of Ramanand, which came from southern\r\nIndia, has been influenced by the Christian settlements in that region,\r\nwhich go back to very early times. It is also possible that Sufiism, the\r\npietistic (as distinguished from the theosophic) form of which seems to\r\nowe much to eastern Christianity, has contributed some echo of the\r\nGospel to Kabir's teaching. A third (but scarcely probable) hypothesis\r\nis that the sect has borrowed both maxims and ritual, long after Kabir's\r\nown time, from the teaching of the Roman Catholic missionaries, who were\r\nestablished at Agra from the reign of Akbar (1556-1605) onwards.\r\n\r\n  No critical edition of the writings current under the name of Kabir\r\n  has yet been published, though collections of his sayings (chiefly the\r\n  _Sakhis_) are constantly appearing from Indian presses. The reader is\r\n  referred, for a summary account of his life and doctrine, to H. H.\r\n  Wilson's _Sketch of the Religious Sects of the Hindus_ (Works, i. 68\r\n  sqq.). Dr E. Trumpp's edition of the _Adi Granth_ (Introduction, pp.\r\n  xcvii. sqq.) may also be consulted. Recent publications dealing with\r\n  the subject are the Rev. G. H. Westcott's _Kabir and the Kabir Panth_\r\n  (Cawnpore, 1908), and Mr. M. A. Macauliffe's _The Sikh Religion_\r\n  (Oxford, 1909), vi. 122-316.     (C. J.

Estimated pop. (1901),\r\n140,000. Lying at the foot of the bare and rocky mountains forming the\r\nwestern boundary of the Kabul valley, just below the gorge made by the\r\nKabul River, the city extends a mile and a half east to west and one\r\nmile north to south. Hemmed in by the mountains, there is no way of\r\nextending it, except in a northerly direction towards the Sherpur\r\ncantonment. As the key of northern India, Kabul has been a city of vast\r\nimportance for countless ages. It commands all the passes which here\r\ndebouch from the north through the Hindu Kush, and from the west through\r\nKandahar; and through it passed successive invasions of India by\r\nAlexander the Great, Mahmud of Ghazni, Jenghiz Khan, Baber, Nadir Shah\r\nand Ahmad Shah. Indeed from the time of Baber to that of Nadir Shah\r\n(1526-1738) Kabul was part of the empire of Delhi. It is now some 160 m.\r\nfrom the British frontier post of Jamrud near Peshawar.\r\n\r\nKabul was formerly walled; the old wall had seven gates, of which two\r\nalone remain, the Lahori and the Sirdar. The city itself is a huddle of\r\nnarrow and dirty streets, with the Bala Hissar or fort forming the\r\nsouth-east angle, and rising about 150 ft. above the plain. The Amir's\r\npalace is situated outside the town about midway between it and the\r\nSherpur cantonment which lies about a mile to the north-east. Formerly\r\nthe greatest ornament of the city was the arcaded and roofed bazaar\r\ncalled _Chihar Chata_, ascribed to Ali Mardan Khan, a noble of the 17th\r\ncentury, who has left behind him many monuments of his munificent public\r\nspirit both in Kabul and in Hindustan. Its four arms had an aggregate\r\nlength of about 600 ft., with a breadth of 30. The display of goods was\r\nremarkable, and in the evening it was illuminated. This edifice was\r\ndestroyed by Sir G. Pollock on evacuating Kabul in 1842 as a record of\r\nthe treachery of the city.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of the Sultan Baber stands on a slope about a mile to the west\r\nof the city in a charming spot. The grave is marked by two erect slabs\r\nof white marble. Near him lie several of his wives and children; the\r\ngarden was formerly enclosed by a marble wall; a clear stream waters the\r\nflower-beds. From the hill that rises behind the tomb there is a noble\r\nprospect of his beloved city, and of the all-fruitful plain stretching\r\nto the north of it.\r\n\r\nAfter the accession of Abdur Rahman in 1880 the city underwent great\r\nchanges. The Bala Hissar was destroyed and has never since been entirely\r\nrebuilt, and a fortified cantonment at Sherpur (one side of which was\r\nrepresented by the historic Bemaru ridge) had taken the place of the old\r\nearthworks of the British occupation of 1842 which were constructed on\r\nnearly the same site. The city streets were as narrow and evil-smelling,\r\nthe surrounding gardens as picturesque and attractive, and the wealth of\r\nfruit was as great, as they had been fifty years previously. The amir,\r\nhowever, effected many improvements. Kabul is now connected by\r\nwell-planned and metalled roads with Afghan Turkestan on the west, with\r\nthe Oxus and Bokhara on the north, and with India on the east. The road\r\nto India was first made by British and is now maintained by Afghan\r\nengineers. The road southwards to Ghazni and Kandahar was always\r\nnaturally excellent and has probably needed little engineering, but the\r\ngeneral principle of road-making in support of a military advance has\r\nalways been consistently maintained, and the expeditions of Kabul troops\r\nto Kafiristan have been supported by a very well graded and\r\nsubstantially constructed road up the Kunar valley from Jalalabad to\r\nAsmar, and onwards to the Bashgol valley of Kafiristan. The city ways\r\nhave been improved until it has become possible for wheeled vehicles to\r\npass, and the various roads connecting the suburbs and the city are\r\nefficiently maintained. A purely local railway has also been introduced,\r\nto assist in transporting building material. The buildings erected by\r\nAbdur Rahman were pretentious, but unmarked by any originality in design\r\nand hardly worthy representation of the beauty and dignity of Mahommedan\r\narchitecture. They included a new palace and a durbar hall, a bridge\r\nacross the river and embankment, a pavilion and garden laid out around\r\nthe site of Baber's tomb overlooking the Chardeh valley; and many other\r\nbuildings of public utility connected with stud arrangements, the\r\nmanufacture of small arms and ammunition, and the requirements of what\r\nmay be termed a wholesale shop under European direction, besides\r\nhospitals, dispensaries, bazaars, &c. The new palace is within an\r\nentrenchment just outside the city. It is enclosed in a fine garden,\r\nwell planted with trees, where the harem serai (or ladies' apartments)\r\noccupies a considerable space. The public portion of the buildings\r\ncomprise an ornamental and lofty pavilion with entrances on each side,\r\nand a high-domed octagonal room in the centre, beautifully fitted and\r\nappointed, where public receptions take place. The durbar hall, which is\r\na separate building, is 60 yards long by 20 broad, with a painted roof\r\nsupported by two rows of pillars. But the arrangement of terraced\r\ngardens and the lightly constructed pavilion which graces the western\r\nslopes of the hills overlooking Chardeh are the most attractive of these\r\ninnovations. Here, on a summer's day, with the scent of roses pervading\r\nthe heated air, the cool refreshment of the passing breezes and of\r\nsplashing fountains may be enjoyed by the officials of the Kabul court,\r\nwhilst they look across the beauty of the thickly planted plains of\r\nChardeh to the rugged outlines of Paghman and the snows of the Hindu\r\nKush. The artistic taste of the landscape gardening is excellent, and\r\nthe mountain scenery is not unworthy of Kashmir. It is pleasant to\r\nrecord that the graveyard of those officers who fell in the Kabul\r\ncampaign of 1879-1880, which lies at the northern end of the Bemaru\r\nridge, is not uncared for.\r\n\r\n  Kabul is believed to be the _Ortospanum_ or _Ortospana_ of the\r\n  geographies of Alexander's march, a name conjectured to be a\r\n  corruption of _Urddhasthana_, \"high place.\" This is the meaning of the\r\n  name Bala Hissar. But the actual name is perhaps also found as that of\r\n  a people in this position (Ptolemy's _Kabolitae_), if not in the name\r\n  of a city apparently identical with Ortospana, _Carura_, in some\r\n  copies read_ Cabura_. It was invaded by the Arabs as early as the\r\n  thirty-fifth year of the Hegira, but it was long before the\r\n  Mahommedans effected any lasting settlement. In the early Mahommedan\r\n  histories and geographies we find (according to a favourite Arabic\r\n  love of jingle) _Kabul_ and _Zabul_ constantly associated. Zabul\r\n  appears to have been the country about Ghazni. Kabul first became a\r\n  capital when Baber made himself master of it in 1504, and here he\r\n  reigned for fifteen years before his invasion of Hindustan. In modern\r\n  times it became a capital again, under Timur Shah (see AFGHANISTAN),\r\n  and so has continued both to the end of the Durani dynasty, and under\r\n  the Barakzais, who now reign. It was occupied by Sir John Keane in\r\n  1839, General Pollock in 1842, and again by Sir Frederick, afterwards\r\n  Lord Roberts, in 1879.\r\n\r\n  Kabul is also the name of the province including the city so called.\r\n  It may be considered to embrace the whole of the plains called Koh\r\n  Daman and Beghram, &c., to the Hindu Kush northward, with the Kohistan\r\n  or hill country adjoining. Eastward it extends to the border of\r\n  Jalalabad at Jagdalak; southward it includes the Logar district, and\r\n  extends to the border of Ghazni; north-westward it includes the\r\n  Paghman hills, and the valley of the upper Kabul river, and so to the\r\n  Koh-i-Baba. Roughly it embraces a territory of about 100 m. square,\r\n  chiefly mountainous. Wheat and barley are the staple products of the\r\n  arable tracts. Artificial grasses are also much cultivated, and fruits\r\n  largely, especially in the Koh Daman. A considerable part of the\r\n  population spends the summer in tents. The villages are not enclosed\r\n  by fortifications, but contain small private castles or fortalices.\r\n\r\n  See C. Yate, _Northern Afghanistan_ (1888); J. A. Gray, _At the Court\r\n  of the Amir_ (1895); Sir T. H. H. Holdich, _The Indian Borderland_\r\n  (1901).     (T. H. H.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKABUL RIVER, a river of Afghanistan, 300 m. in length. The Kabul\r\n(ancient _Kophes_), which is the most important (although not the\r\nlargest) river in Afghanistan, rises at the foot of the Unai pass\r\nleading over the Sanglakh range, an offshoot of the Hindu Kush towards\r\nBamian and Afghan Turkestan. Its basin forms the province of Kabul,\r\nwhich includes all northern Afghanistan between the Hindu Kush and the\r\nSafed Koh ranges. From its source to the city of Kabul the course of the\r\nriver is only 45 m., and this part of it is often exhausted in summer\r\nfor purposes of irrigation. Half a mile east of Kabul it is joined by\r\nthe Logar, a much larger river, which rises beyond Ghazni among the\r\nslopes of the Gul Koh (14,200 ft.), and drains the rich and picturesque\r\nvalleys of Logar and Wardak. Below the confluence the Kabul becomes a\r\nrapid stream with a great volume of water and gradually absorbs the\r\nwhole drainage of the Hindu Kush. About 40 m. below Kabul the Panjshir\r\nriver joins it; 15 m. farther the Tagao; 20 m. from the Tagao junction\r\nthe united streams of Alingar and Alishang (rivers of Kafiristan); and\r\n20 m. below that, at Balabagh, the Surkhab from the Safed Koh. Two or\r\nthree miles below Jalalabad it is joined by the Kunar, the river of\r\nChitral. Thenceforward it passes by deep gorges through the Mohmand\r\nhills, curving northward until it emerges into the Peshawar plain at\r\nMichni. Soon afterwards it receives the Swat river from the north and\r\nthe Bara river from the south, and after a further course of 40 m. falls\r\ninto the Indus at Attock. From Jalalabad downwards the river is\r\nnavigable by boats or rafts of inflated skins, and is considerably used\r\nfor purposes of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKABYLES, or KABAIL, a confederation of tribes in Algeria, Tunisia, and a\r\nfew oases of the Sahara, who form a branch of the great Berber race.\r\nTheir name is the Arabic _gabilat_ (pl.: _gabail_), and was at first\r\nindiscriminately applied by the Arabs to all Berber peoples. The part of\r\nAlgeria which they inhabit is usually regarded as consisting of two\r\ndivisions--Great Kabylia and Lesser Kabylia, the former being also known\r\nas the Kabylia of the Jurjura (also called Adrar Budfel, \"Mountain of\r\nSnow\"). Physically many Kabyles do not present much contrast to the\r\nArabs of Algeria. Both Kabyle and Arab are white at birth, but rapidly\r\ngrow brown through exposure to air and sunshine. Both have in general\r\nbrown eyes and wavy hair of coarse quality, varying from dark brown to\r\njet black. In stature there is perhaps a little difference in favour of\r\nthe Kabyle, and he appears also to be of heavier build and more\r\nmuscular. Both are clearly long-headed. Some, however, of the purer type\r\nof Kabyles in Kabylia proper have fair skins, ruddy complexions and blue\r\nor grey eyes. In fact there are two distinct types of Kabyles: those\r\nwhich by much admixture have approximated to Arab and negroid types, and\r\nthose which preserve Libyan features. Active, energetic and\r\nenterprising, the Kabyle is to be found far from home--as a soldier in\r\nthe French army, as a workman in the towns, as a field labourer, or as a\r\npedlar or trader earning the means of purchasing his bit of ground in\r\nhis native village. The Kabyles are Mahommedans of the Sunnite branch\r\nand the Malikite rite, looking to Morocco as the nearer centre of their\r\nreligion. Some of the Kabyles retain their vernacular speech, while\r\nothers have more or less completely adopted Arabic. The best known of\r\nthe Kabyle dialects is the Zouave[1] or Igaouaouen, those speaking it\r\nhaving been settled on the northern side of the Jurjura at least from\r\nthe time of Ibn Khaldun; it is the principal basis of Hanoteau's _Essai\r\nde grammaire kabyle_ (Paris, 1858). Unlike their southern brethren, the\r\nKabyles have no alphabet, and their literature is still in the stage of\r\noral transmission, for the most part by professional reciters.\r\nHanoteau's _Poesies populaires de la Kabylie du Jurjura_ (Paris, 1867)\r\ngives the text and translation of a considerable number of historical\r\npieces, proverbial couplets and quatrains, dancing songs, &c.\r\n\r\n  Consult General L.

It is\r\ndriven, like a wedge, into the frontier mountain system and extends for\r\n150 m. from Jacobabad to Sibi, with nearly as great a breadth at its\r\nbase on the Sind frontier. Area, 5310 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 82,909. The\r\nMula pass, which connects it with the Kalat highlands, was once (when\r\nthe ancient city of Kandabel was the capital of Gandava) a much trodden\r\ntrade highway, and is still a practicable route though no longer a\r\npopular one. The soil is fertile wherever it can be irrigated by the\r\nfloods brought down from the surrounding hills; but much of the central\r\nportion is sandy waste. It is traversed by the North-Western railway.\r\nThe climate is unhealthy in summer, when pestilential hot winds are\r\nsometimes destructive to life. The annual rainfall averages only 3 in.\r\nKachhi, though subject to the khan of Kalat, is administered under the\r\ntribal system. There are no schools, dispensaries or gaols.\r\n\r\n  See _Baluchistan District Gazetteer_, vol. vi. (Bombay, 1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKACHIN HILLS, a mountainous tract in Upper Burma, inhabited by the\r\nKachin or Chingpaw, who are known on the Assam frontier as Singphos.\r\nOwing to the great number of tribes, sub-tribes and clans of the\r\nKachins, the part of the Kachin hills which has been taken under\r\nadministration in the Myitkyina and Bhamo districts was divided into 40\r\nKachin hill tracts (recently reduced to five). Beyond these tracts there\r\nare many Kachins in Katha, Mong Mit and the northern Shan States. The\r\ncountry within the Kachin hill tracts is roughly estimated at 19,177 sq.\r\nm., and consists of a series of ranges, for the most part running north\r\nand south, and intersected by valleys, all leading towards the\r\nIrrawaddy, which drains the country. There were 64,405 Kachins\r\nenumerated at the census of 1901. Philological investigations show that\r\nit is probable that the progenitors of the Kachins or Chingpaw were the\r\nIndo-Chinese race who, before the beginnings of history, but after the\r\nMon-Annam wave had covered Indo-China, forsook their home in western\r\nChina to pour over the region where Tibet, Assam, Burma and China\r\nconverge, and that the Chingpaw are the residue left round the\r\nheadquarters of the Irrawaddy and the Chindwin after those branches,\r\ndestined to become the Tibetans, the Nagas, the Burmans and the Kuki\r\nChins, had gone westwards and southwards. In the middle of the 19th\r\ncentury the southern limit of the Kachins was 200 m. farther north than\r\nit is now. Since then the race has been drifting steadily southward and\r\neastward, a vast aggregate of small independent clans united by no\r\ncommon government, but all obeying a common impulse to move outwards\r\nfrom their original seats along the line of least resistance. Now the\r\nKachins are on both sides of the border of Upper Burma, and are a force\r\nto be reckoned with by frontier administrators. According to the Kachin\r\nHill Tribes Regulation of 1895, administrative responsibility is\r\naccepted by the British government on the left bank of the Irrawaddy for\r\nthe country south of the Nmaikha, and on the right bank for the country\r\nsouth of a line drawn from the confluence of the Malikha and Nmaikha\r\nthrough the northern limit of the Laban district and including the jade\r\nmines. The tribes north of this line were told that if they abstained\r\nfrom raiding to the south of it they would not be interfered with. South\r\nof that line peace was to be enforced and a small tribute exacted, with\r\na minimum of interference in their private affairs. On the British side\r\nof the border the chief objects have been the disarmament of the tribes\r\nand the construction of frontier and internal roads. A light tribute is\r\nexacted.\r\n\r\n  The Kachins have been the object of many police operations and two\r\n  regular expeditions: (1) Expedition of 1892-93. Bhamo was occupied by\r\n  the British on the 28th of December 1885, and almost immediately\r\n  trouble began. Constant punitive measures were carried on by the\r\n  military police; but in December 1892 a police column proceeding to\r\n  establish a post at Sima was heavily attacked, and simultaneously the\r\n  town of Myitkyina was raided by Kachins. A force of 1200 troops was\r\n  sent to put down the rising. The enemy received their final blow at\r\n  Palap, but not before three officers were killed, three wounded, and\r\n  102 sepoys and followers killed and wounded. (2) Expedition of\r\n  1895-96. The continued misconduct of the Sana Kachins from beyond the\r\n  administrative border rendered punitive measures necessary. They had\r\n  remained unpunished since the attack on Myitkyina in December 1892.\r\n  Two columns were sent up, one of 250 rifles from Myitkyina, the other\r\n  of 200 rifles from Mogaung, marching in December 1895. The resistance\r\n  was insignificant, and the operations were completely successful. A\r\n  strong force of military police is stationed at Myitkyina, with\r\n  several outposts in the Kachin hills, and the country is never wholly\r\n  free from crimes of violence committed by the Kachins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKADUR, a district of Mysore state, in southern India, with an area of\r\n2813 sq. m. Pop. (1901), 362,752, showing an increase of 9% in the\r\ndecade. The larger portion of the district consists of the Malnad or\r\nhill country, which contains some of the wildest mountain scenery in\r\nsouthern India. The western frontier is formed by the chain of the\r\nGhats, of which the highest peaks are the Kudremukh (6215 ft.) and the\r\nMeniti Gudda (5451 ft.). The centre is occupied by the horse-shoe range\r\nof the Baba Budans, containing the loftiest mountain in Mysore,\r\nMulaingiri (6317 ft.). The Maidan or plain country lying beneath the\r\namphitheatre formed by the Baba Budan hills is a most fertile region,\r\nwell watered, and with the famous \"black cotton soil.\" The principal\r\nrivers are the Tunga and Bhadra, which rise near each other in the\r\nGhats, and unite to form the Tungabhadra, a tributary of the Kistna. The\r\neastern region is watered by the Vedavati. At the point where this river\r\nleaves the Baba Budan hills it is embanked to form two extensive tanks\r\nwhich irrigate the lower valley. From all the rivers water is drawn off\r\ninto irrigation channels by means of anicuts or weirs. The chief natural\r\nwealth of Kadur is in its forests, which contain inexhaustible supplies\r\nof the finest timber, especially teak, and also furnish shelter for the\r\ncoffee plantations. Iron is found and smelted at the foot of the hills,\r\nand corundum exists in certain localities. Wild beasts and game are\r\nnumerous, and fish are abundant.\r\n\r\nThe largest town is Tarikere (pop. 10,164); the headquarters are at\r\nChikmagalur (9515): The staple crop is rice, chiefly grown on the hill\r\nslopes, where the natural rainfall is sufficient, or in the river\r\nvalley, where the fields can be irrigated. Coffee cultivation is said to\r\nhave been introduced by a Mahommedan saint, Baba Budan, more than two\r\ncenturies ago; but it first attracted European capital in 1840. The\r\ndistrict is served by the Southern Mahratta railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAEMPFER, ENGELBRECHT (1651-1716), German traveller and physician, was\r\nborn on the 16th of November 1651 at Lemgo in Lippe-Detmold, Westphalia,\r\nwhere his father was a pastor. He studied at Hameln, Luneburg, Hamburg,\r\nLubeck and Danzig, and after graduating Ph.D. at Cracow, spent four\r\nyears at Konigsberg in Prussia, studying medicine and natural science.\r\nIn 1681 he visited Upsala in Sweden, where he was offered inducements to\r\nsettle; but his desire for foreign travel led him to become secretary to\r\nthe embassy which Charles XI. sent through Russia to Persia in 1683. He\r\nreached Persia by way of Moscow, Kazan and Astrakhan, landing at Nizabad\r\nin Daghestan after a voyage in the Caspian; from Shemakha in Shirvan he\r\nmade an expedition to the Baku peninsula, being perhaps the first modern\r\nscientist to visit these fields of \"eternal fire.\" In 1684 he arrived in\r\nIsfahan, then the Persian capital. When after a stay of more than a year\r\nthe Swedish embassy prepared to return, Kaempfer joined the fleet of the\r\nDutch East India Company in the Persian Gulf as chief surgeon, and in\r\nspite of fever caught at Bander Abbasi he found opportunity to see\r\nsomething of Arabia and of many of the western coast-lands of India. In\r\nSeptember 1689 he reached Batavia; spent the following winter in\r\nstudying Javanese natural history; and in May 1690 set out for Japan as\r\nphysician to the embassy sent yearly to that country by the Dutch. The\r\nship in which he sailed touched at Siam, whose capital he visited; and\r\nin September 1690 he arrived at Nagasaki, the only Japanese port then\r\nopen to foreigners. Kaempfer stayed two years in Japan, during which he\r\ntwice visited Tokyo. His adroitness, insinuating manners and medical\r\nskill overcame the habitual jealousy and reticence of the natives, and\r\nenabled him to elicit much valuable information. In November 1692 he\r\nleft Japan for Java and Europe, and in October 1693 he landed at\r\nAmsterdam. Receiving the degree of M.D. at Leiden, he settled down in\r\nhis native city, becoming also physician to the count of Lippe. He died\r\nat Lemgo on the 2nd of November 1716.\r\n\r\n  The only work Kaempfer lived to publish was _Amoenitatum exoticarum\r\n  politico-physico-medicarum fasciculi_ V. (Lemgo, 1712), a selection\r\n  from his papers giving results of his invaluable observations in\r\n  Georgia, Persia and Japan. At his death the unpublished manuscripts\r\n  were purchased by Sir Hans Sloane, and conveyed to England. Among them\r\n  was a _History of Japan_, translated from the manuscript into English\r\n  by J. G. Scheuchzer and published at London, in 2 vols., in 1727. The\r\n  original German has never been published, the extant German version\r\n  being taken from the English. Besides Japanese history, this book\r\n  contains a description of the political, social and physical state of\r\n  the country in the 17th century. For upwards of a hundred years it\r\n  remained the chief source of information for the general reader, and\r\n  is still not wholly obsolete. A life of the author is prefixed to the\r\n  _History_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAFFA, a country of N.E. Africa, part of the Abyssinian empire. Kaffa\r\nproper (formerly known also as Gomara) has an area of little more than\r\n5000 sq. m., but the name is used in a general sense to include the\r\nneighbouring territories of Gimirra, Jimma, Ennarea, &c. In this larger\r\nacceptation Kaffa extends roughly from 6 deg. to 9 deg. N. and from 35\r\ndeg. to 37(1/2) deg. E. It forms the S.W. part of the great Abyssinian\r\nplateau and consists of broken table-land deeply scored by mountain\r\ntorrents and densely wooded. The general elevation is about 8000 ft.,\r\nwhile several peaks are over 10,000 ft. From the western slopes of the\r\nplateau descend headstreams of the Sobat. The principal river however is\r\nthe Omo, the chief feeder of Lake Rudolf. Kaffa proper is believed to be\r\nthe native home of the coffee plant (whence the name), which grows in\r\nprofusion on the mountain sides. The principal town was Bonga, 7(1/2)\r\ndeg. N., 36 deg. 12' E., a great trading centre, but the Abyssinian\r\nheadquarters are at Anderacha, about 12 m. S.S.W. of Bonga. Jiren, the\r\ncapital of Jimma, 60 m. N.E. of Bonga, is a still more important town,\r\nits weekly market being attended by some 20,000 persons.\r\n\r\nA great variety of races inhabit these countries of southern Ethiopia.\r\nThe Kaficho (people of Kaffa proper) are said to be of the same stock as\r\nthe northern Abyssinians and to have been separated from the rest of the\r\ncountry by the Mahommedan invasion of the 16th century. Thus Jimma,\r\nimmediately north of Kaffa proper, is peopled by Mahommedan Gallas. The\r\nKaficho, though much mixed with Galla blood, retained their Christianity\r\nand a knowledge of Geez, the ecclesiastical tongue of Abyssinia. The\r\nordinary language of the Kaficho has no outward resemblance to modern\r\nAbyssinian. Their speech was, however, stated by Dr C. T. Beke (c. 1850)\r\nto be cognate with the Gonga tongue, spoken in a portion of Damot, on\r\nthe northern side of the Abai. Kaffa, after having been ruled by\r\nindependent sovereigns, who were also suzerains of the neighbouring\r\nstates, was about 1895 conquered by the Abyssinians. The first European\r\nexplorer of Kaffa was Antoine de'Abbadie, who visited it in 1843. Not\r\nuntil the early years of the 20th century was the country accurately\r\nmapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAFFIR BREAD, in botany, the popular name for a species of\r\n_Encephalartos_ (_E. caffra_), one of the cycads, a native of South\r\nAfrica, so called from the farinaceous food-stuff which is found at the\r\napex of the stem (Gr. [Greek: en], in, [Greek: kephale], head, and\r\n[Greek: artos], bread). It is a tree reaching nearly 20 ft. in height,\r\nwith very stiff, spreading pinnate leaves 3 to 4 ft. long and recurving\r\nat the tip. The species of _Encephalartos_, which are natives of\r\ntropical and South Africa, form handsome greenhouse and conservatory\r\nplants; some species are effectively used in subtropical gardening in\r\nthe summer months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAFFIRS (Arabic _Kafir_, an unbeliever), a name given by the Arabs to\r\nthe native races of the east coast of Africa. The term was current along\r\nthe east coast at the arrival of the Portuguese, and passed from them to\r\nthe Dutch and English, and to the natives themselves under the form of\r\n_Kafula_. There are no general or collective national names for these\r\npeoples, and the various tribal divisions are mostly designated by\r\nhistorical or legendary chiefs, founders of dynasties or hereditary\r\nchieftaincies. The term has no real ethnological value, for the Kaffirs\r\nhave no national unity. To-day it is used to describe that large family\r\nof Bantu negroes inhabiting the greater part of the Cape, the whole of\r\nNatal and Zululand, and the Portuguese dominions on the east coast south\r\nof the Zambezi. The name is also loosely applied to any negro inhabitant\r\nof South Africa. For example, the Bechuana of the Transvaal and Orange\r\nFree State are usually called Kaffirs.\r\n\r\nThe Kaffirs are divisible into two great branches: the Ama-Zulu with the\r\nAma-Swazi and Ama-Tonga and the Kaffirs proper, represented by the\r\nAma-Xosa, the Tembu (q.v.) and the Pondo (q.v.). Hence the compound term\r\nZulu-Kaffir applied in a collective sense to all the Kaffir peoples.\r\nIntermediate between these two branches were several broken tribes now\r\ncollectively known as Ama-Fengu, i.e. \"wanderers\" or \"needy\" people,\r\nfrom _fenguza_, to seek service[1] (see FINGO).\r\n\r\n  The ramifications of the Kaffirs proper cannot be understood without\r\n  reference to the national genealogies, most of the tribal names, as\r\n  already stated, being those of real or reputed founders of dynasties.\r\n  Thus the term Ama-Xosa means simply the \"people of Xosa,\" a somewhat\r\n  mythical chief supposed to have flourished about the year 1530. Ninth\r\n  in descent from his son Toguh was Palo, who died about 1780, leaving\r\n  two sons, Gcaleka and Rarabe (pronounced Kha-Kha-be), from whom came\r\n  the Ama-Gcaleka, Ama-Dhlambe (T'slambies) and the Ama-Ngquika (Gaika\r\n  or Sandili's people). The Pondo do not descend from Xosa, but probably\r\n  from an elder brother, while the Tembu, though apparently representing\r\n  a younger branch, are regarded by all the Kaffir tribes as the royal\r\n  race. Hence the Gcaleka chief, who is the head of all the Ama-Xosa\r\n  tribes, always takes his first or \"great wife\" from the Tembu royal\r\n  family, and her issue alone have any claim to the succession. The\r\n  subjoined genealogical tree will place Kaffir relations in a clearer\r\n  light:--\r\n\r\n                Zuide (1500?), reputed founder of the nation.\r\n                                      |\r\n        +--------------------+--------+---------------+\r\n        |                    |                        |\r\n      Tembu.

They were originally an obscure tribe occupying the\r\n  basin of the Umfolosi river, but rose suddenly to power under\r\n  Chaka,[2] who had been brought up among the neighbouring and powerful\r\n  Umtetwas, and who succeeded the chiefs of that tribe and of his own in\r\n  the beginning of the 19th century. But the true mother tribe seems to\r\n  have been the extinct Ama-Ntombela, whence the Ama-Tefulu, the\r\n  U'ndwande, U'mlelas, U'mtetwas and many others, all absorbed or\r\n  claiming to be true Zulus. But they are only so by political\r\n  subjection, and the gradual adoption of the Zulu dress, usages and\r\n  speech. Hence in most cases the term Zulu implies political rather\r\n  than blood relationship. This remark applies also to the followers of\r\n  Mosilikatze (properly Umsilikazi), who, after a fierce struggle with\r\n  the Bechuana, founded about 1820 a second Zulu state about the head\r\n  waters of the Orange river. In 1837 most of them were driven\r\n  northwards by the Boers and are now known as Matabele.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Zulu-Kaffir race has given rise to much controversy.\r\nIt is obvious that they are not the aborigines of their present domain,\r\nwhence in comparatively recent times--since the beginning of the 16th\r\ncentury--they have displaced the Hottentots and Bushmen of fundamentally\r\ndistinct stock. They themselves are conscious of their foreign origin.\r\nYet they are closely allied in speech (see BANTU LANGUAGES) and physique\r\nto the surrounding Basuto, Bechuana and other members of the great South\r\nAfrican Negroid family. Hence their appearance in the south-east corner\r\nof the continent is sufficiently explained by the gradual onward\r\nmovement of the populations pressing southward on the Hottentot and\r\nBushman domain. The specific differences in speech and appearance by\r\nwhich they are distinguished from the other branches of the family must\r\nin the same way be explained by the altered conditions of their new\r\nhabitat. Hence it is that the farther they have penetrated southwards\r\nthe farther have they become differentiated from the pure Negro type.\r\nThus the light and clear brown complexion prevalent amongst the\r\nsouthern Tembu becomes gradually darker as we proceed northwards,\r\npassing at last to the blue-black and sepia of the Ama-Swazi and Tekeza.\r\nEven many of the mixed Fingo tribes are of a polished ebony colour, like\r\nthat of the Jolofs and other Senegambian negroes. The Kaffir hair is\r\nuniformly of a woolly texture. The head is dolichocephalic, but it is\r\nalso high or long vertically,[3] and it is in this feature of\r\nhypsistenocephaly (height and length combined) that the Kaffir presents\r\nthe most striking contrast with the pure Negro. But, the nose being\r\ngenerally rather broad[4] and the lips thick, the Kaffir face, though\r\nsomewhat oval, is never regular in the European sense, the deviations\r\nbeing normally in the direction of the Negro, with which race the\r\npeculiar odour of the skin again connects the Kaffirs. In stature they\r\nrank next to the Patagonians, Polynesians and West Africans, averaging\r\nfrom 5 ft. 9 in. to 5 ft. 11 in., and even 6 ft.[5] They are slim,\r\nwell-proportioned and muscular. Owing to the hard life they lead, the\r\nwomen are generally inferior in appearance to the men, except amongst\r\nthe Zulu, and especially the Tembu. Hence in the matrimonial market,\r\nwhile the Ama-Xosa girl realizes no more than ten or twelve head of\r\ncattle, the Tembu belle fetches as many as forty, and if especially fine\r\neven eighty.\r\n\r\n  The more warlike tribes were usually arrayed in leopard or ox skins,\r\n  of late years generally replaced by European blankets, with feather\r\n  head-dresses, coral and metal ornaments, bead armlets and necklaces.\r\n  The Makua and a few others practise tattooing, and the Ama-Xosa are\r\n  fond of painting or smearing their bodies with red ochre. Their arms\r\n  consist chiefly of ox-hide shields 4 to 6 ft. long, the kerrie or\r\n  club, and the assegai, of which there are two kinds, one long, with\r\n  9-in. narrow blade, for throwing, the other short, with broad blade 12\r\n  to 18 in. long, for stabbing. The dwellings are simple conical huts\r\n  grouped in kraals or villages. Although cattle form their chief\r\n  wealth, and hunting and stock-breeding their main pursuits, many have\r\n  turned to husbandry. The Zulu raise regular crops of \"mealies\"\r\n  (maize), and the Pondo cultivate a species of millet, tobacco, water\r\n  melons, yams and other vegetables. Milk (never taken fresh), millet\r\n  and maize form the staples of food, and meat is seldom eaten except in\r\n  time of war.\r\n\r\n  A young Kaffir attains man's estate socially, not at puberty, but upon\r\n  his marriage. Polygyny is the rule and each wife is regarded as adding\r\n  dignity to the household. Marriage is by purchase, the price being\r\n  paid in cattle. Upon the husband's death family life is continued\r\n  under the headship of the eldest son of the house, the widows by\r\n  virtue of levirate becoming the property of the uncle or nearest\r\n  males, not sons. A son inherits and honourably liquidates, if he can,\r\n  his father's debts.\r\n\r\n  Mentally the Kaffirs are superior to the Negro. In their social and\r\n  political relations they display great tact and intelligence; they are\r\n  remarkably brave, warlike and hospitable, and were honest and truthful\r\n  until through contact with the whites they became suspicious,\r\n  revengeful and thievish, besides acquiring most European vices. Of\r\n  religion as ordinarily understood they have very little, and have\r\n  certainly never developed any mythologies or dogmatic systems. It is\r\n  more than doubtful whether they had originally formed any notion of a\r\n  Supreme Being. Some conception, however, of a future state is implied\r\n  by a strongly developed worship of ancestry, and by a belief in\r\n  spirits and ghosts to whom sacrifices are made. There are no idols or\r\n  priests, but belief in witchcraft formerly gave the \"witch-doctor\" or\r\n  medicine-man overwhelming power.[6] Circumcision and polygyny are\r\n  universal; the former is sometimes attributed to Mahommedan\r\n  influences, but has really prevailed almost everywhere in East Africa\r\n  from the remotest time.\r\n\r\n  Dearer than anything else to the Kaffir are his cattle; and many\r\n  ceremonial observances in connexion with them were once the rule.\r\n  Formerly ox-racing was a common sport, the oxen running, riderless,\r\n  over a ten-mile course. The owner of a champion racing ox was a\r\n  popular hero, and these racers were valued at hundreds of head of\r\n  cattle. Cattle are the currency of the Kaffirs in their wild state.\r\n  Ten to twenty head are the price of a wife. When a girl marries, her\r\n  father (if well off) presents her with a cow from his herd. This\r\n  animal is called _ubulungu_ or \"doer of good\" and is regarded as\r\n  sacred. It must never be killed nor may its descendants, as long as it\r\n  lives. A hair of its tail is tied round the neck of each child\r\n  immediately after birth. In large kraals there is the \"dancing-ox,\"\r\n  usually of red colour. Its horns are trained to peculiar shapes by\r\n  early mutilations. It figures in many ceremonies when it is paid a\r\n  kind of knee-worship.\r\n\r\n  The Kaffirs have three, not four, seasons: \"Green Heads,\" \"Kindness\"\r\n  and \"Cutting\"; the first and last referring to the crops, the second\r\n  to the \"warm weather.\" Women and children only eat after the men are\r\n  satisfied. A light beer made from sorghum is the national drink.\r\n\r\n  Of the few industries the chief are copper and iron smelting,\r\n  practised by the Tembu, Zulu and Swazi, who manufacture weapons,\r\n  spoons and agricultural implements both for their own use and for\r\n  trade. The Swazi display some taste in wood-carving, and others\r\n  prepare a peculiar water-tight vessel of grass. Characteristic of this\r\n  race is their neglect of the art of navigation. Not the smallest boats\r\n  are ever made for crossing the rivers, much less for venturing on the\r\n  sea, except by the Makazana of Delagoa Bay and by the Zambezi people,\r\n  who have canoes and flat-bottomed boats made of planks.\r\n\r\n  The Kaffir race had a distinct and apparently very old political\r\n  system, which may be described as a patriarchal monarchy limited by a\r\n  powerful aristocracy. Under British rule the tribal independence of\r\n  the Kaffirs has disappeared. Varying degrees of autonomy have been\r\n  granted, but the supreme powers of the chiefs have gone, the Swazi\r\n  being in 1904 the last to be brought to order. In the Transkeian\r\n  Territories tribal organization exists, but it is modified by special\r\n  legislation and the natives are under the control of special\r\n  magistrates. To a considerable extent in Natal and throughout Zululand\r\n  the Kaffirs are placed in reserves, where tribal organization is kept\r\n  up under European supervision. In Basutoland the tribal organization\r\n  is very strong, and the power of chiefs is upheld by the imperial\r\n  government, which exercises general supervision.\r\n\r\n  See Gustav Fritsch, _Die Eingeborenen Sudafrikas_, with atlas, 30\r\n  plates and 120 typical heads (Breslau, 1872); W.

Any tribes which become broken and mixed would\r\n    probably be regarded as Ama-Fengu by the other Kaffirs. Hence the\r\n    multiplicity of clans, such as the Ama-Bele, Aba-Sembotweni Ama-Zizi,\r\n    Ama-Kuze, Aba-Sekunene, Ama-Ntokaze, Ama-Tetyeni Aba-Shwawa, &c., all\r\n    of whom are collectively grouped as Ama-Fengu.\r\n\r\n  [2] Seventh in descent from Zulu, through Kumede, Makeba, Punga,\r\n    Ndaba, Yama and Tezengakona or Senzangakona (Bleek, _Zulu Legends_).\r\n\r\n  [3] P. Topinard, _Anthropology_ (1878), p. 274.\r\n\r\n  [4] This feature varies considerably, \"in the T'slambie tribes being\r\n    broader and more of the Negro shape than in the Gaika or Gcaleka,\r\n    while among the Ama-Tembu and Ama-Mpondo it assumes more of the\r\n    European character. In many of them the perfect Grecian and Roman\r\n    noses are discernible\" (Fleming's _Kaffraria_, p. 92).\r\n\r\n  [5] Gustav Fritsch gives the mean of the Ama-Xosa as 1.718 metres,\r\n    less than that of the Guinea Negro (1.724), but more than the English\r\n    (1.708) and Scotch (1.710).\r\n\r\n  [6] Since the early years of the 19th century Protestant and Roman\r\n    Catholic missions have gained hundreds of thousands of converts among\r\n    the Kaffirs. Purely native Christian churches have also been\r\n    organized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAFFRARIA, the descriptive name given to the S.E. part of the Cape\r\nprovince, South Africa. Kaffraria, i.e. the land of the Kaffirs (q.v.),\r\nis no longer an official designation. It used to comprise the districts\r\nnow known as King William's Town and East London, which formed British\r\nKaffraria, annexed to Cape Colony in 1865, and the territory beyond the\r\nKei River south of the Drakensberg Mountains as far as the Natal\r\nfrontier, known as Kaffraria proper. As a geographical term it is still\r\nused to indicate the Transkeian territories of the Cape provinces\r\ncomprising the four administrative divisions of Transkei, Pondoland,\r\nTembuland and Griqualand East, incorporated into Cape Colony at various\r\nperiods between 1879 and 1894. They have a total area of 18,310 sq. m.,\r\nand a population (1904) of 834,644, of whom 16,777 were whites.\r\nExcluding Pondoland--not counted previously to 1904--the population had\r\nincreased from 487,364 in 1891 to 631,887 in 1904.\r\n\r\n  _Physical Features._--The physical characteristics of Kaffraria bear a\r\n  general resemblance to those of the Cape province proper. The country\r\n  rises from sea-level in a series of terraces to the rugged range of\r\n  the Drakensberg. Between that range and the coast-lands are many\r\n  subsidiary ranges with fertile valleys through which a large number of\r\n  rivers make their way to the Indian Ocean. These rivers have very\r\n  rapid falls in comparison to their length and when less than 40 m.\r\n  from the coast are still 2000 ft. above sea-level. The chief,\r\n  beginning at the south, are the Kei, the Bashee, the Umtata, the St\r\n  John's or Umzimvubu, and the Umtamvuna, which separates Kaffraria from\r\n  Natal. The St John's River rises in the Drakensberg near the\r\n  Basuto-Natal frontier. The river valley has a length of 140 m., the\r\n  river with its many twists being double that length. It receives\r\n  numerous tributaries, one, the Tsitza, possessing a magnificent\r\n  waterfall, the river leaping over an almost vertical precipice of 375\r\n  ft. The St John's reaches the sea between precipitous cliffs some 1200\r\n  ft. high and covered with verdure. The mouth is obstructed by a sand\r\n  bar over which there is 14 ft. of water. None of the rivers of\r\n  Kaffraria except the St John's is navigable.\r\n\r\n  Kaffraria is one of the most fertile regions in South Africa. The\r\n  mountain gorges abound in fine trees, thick forest and bush cover the\r\n  river banks, grass grows luxuriantly in the lower regions, and the\r\n  lowlands and valleys are favourable to almost any kind of fruit, field\r\n  and garden cultivation. The coast districts are very hot in summer,\r\n  the temperature from October to April on an average varying from 70\r\n  deg. to 90 deg. F., while in winter the day temperature is seldom\r\n  below 50 deg., though the nights are very cold. But the variation in\r\n  altitude places climates of all grades within easy reach, from the\r\n  burning coast to the often snow-clad mountain. Thunderstorms are\r\n  frequent in summer; the winters are generally dry. On the whole the\r\n  climate is extremely healthy. At St John's are sulphur springs.\r\n\r\n  A considerable area is devoted to the raising of wheat and other\r\n  cereals, especially in the northern district (Griqualand East), where\r\n  in the higher valleys are many farms owned by Europeans. Large\r\n  quantities of stock are raised. Most of the land is held by the\r\n  natives under tribal tenure, and the ease with which their wants are\r\n  supplied is detrimental to the full cultivation of the land. Kaffraria\r\n  is, however, one of the chief recruiting grounds for labour throughout\r\n  South Africa. Most of the white inhabitants are engaged in trade.\r\n\r\n  _Towns and Communication._--The chief town is Kokstad (q.v.), pop.\r\n  (1904), 2903, the capital of Griqualand East. Umtata (2100 ft. above\r\n  the sea, pop. 2342) on the river of the same name, capital of\r\n  Tembuland, is the residence of an assistant chief magistrate,\r\n  headquarters of a division of the Cape Mounted Rifles, and seat of the\r\n  Anglican bishopric of Kaffraria. The principal buildings are the\r\n  cathedral, a Gothic structure, built 1901-1906, and the town-hall, a\r\n  fine building in Renaissance style, erected 1907-1908. Port St John is\r\n  the chief town in Pondoland, and the only harbour of the country.\r\n  Butterworth is the chief town in Transkei. Cala (pop. about 1000), in\r\n  the N.W. part of Tembuland, is the educational centre of Kaffraria. A\r\n  railway, 107 m. long, the first link in the direct Cape-Natal line,\r\n  runs from Indwe, 65 m. from Sterkstroom Junction on the main line from\r\n  East London to the Transvaal, to Maclear, an agricultural centre in\r\n  Griqualand East. Another railway parallel but south of that described\r\n  also traverses Kaffraria. Starting from Amabele, a station on the main\r\n  line from East London to the north, it goes via Butterworth (132 m.\r\n  from East London) to Umtata (234 m.).\r\n\r\n  _Administration and Justice._--The Cape administrative and judicial\r\n  system is in force, save as modified by special enactments of the Cape\r\n  parliament. A \"Native Territories Penal Code\" which came into\r\n  operation on the 1st of January 1887 governs the relations of the\r\n  natives, who are under the jurisdiction of a chief magistrate\r\n  (resident at Cape Town) with subordinate magistrates in the\r\n  Territories. In civil affairs the tribal organization and native laws\r\n  are maintained. No chief, however, exercises criminal jurisdiction.\r\n  Since 1898 certain provisions of the Glen Grey Act have been applied\r\n  to Kaffraria (see GLEN GREY). The revenue is included in the ordinary\r\n  budget of the Cape province. The expenditure on Kaffraria considerably\r\n  exceeds the revenue derived from it. The franchise laws are the same\r\n  as in the Cape proper. Though the Kaffirs outnumber the whites by\r\n  fifty to one, white men form the bulk of the electorate, which in 1904\r\n  numbered 4778.\r\n\r\n  _Religion._--Numbers of Protestant missionary societies have churches\r\n  and educational establishments in Kaffraria, but, except in Fingoland,\r\n  the bulk of the Kaffirs are heathen. The Griquas profess Christianity\r\n  and have their own churches and ministers. The Anglican diocese of St\r\n  John's, Kaffraria, was founded in 1873.\r\n\r\n_Annexation to the Cape._--The story of the conflicts between the Kaffir\r\ntribes and the Cape colonists is told under CAPE COLONY. As early as\r\n1819 Kaffirland, or Kaffraria, was held not to extend west beyond the\r\nKeiskamma River. The region east of that river as far as the Kei River\r\nbecame in 1847 the Crown colony of British Kaffraria, and was annexed to\r\nCape Colony in 1865. The Transkeian territories remained in nominal\r\nindependence until 1875, when the Tembu sought British protection. An\r\ninter-tribal war in 1877 between Fingo and Gcaleka resulted in the\r\nterritory of the Gcaleka chief Kreli being occupied by the British. It\r\nwas not, however, till 1879 that Fingoland and the Idutywa Reserve,\r\ntogether with the district then commonly called Noman's-land, were\r\nproclaimed an integral part of the Cape. About this time most of the\r\nrest of Kaffraria came under British control, but it was 1885 before\r\nGcalekaland, the coast region of Transkei, and the various districts\r\ncomprising Tembuland--Bomvanaland on the coast, Tembuland Proper and\r\nEmigrant Tembuland--were annexed to the colony. By the annexation, the\r\nfrontier of the colony was carried to the Umtata River, so that by 1885\r\nonly Pondoland, fronting on the Indian Ocean, separated the Cape from\r\nNatal. In Pondoland, Port St John, proclaimed British territory in 1881,\r\nwas, along with the lower reaches of the St John's River, incorporated\r\nwith Cape Colony in 1884; in 1886 the Xesibe country (Mount Ayliff) was\r\nannexed to the Cape and added to Griqualand East; and in the following\r\nyear Rhode Valley was included within the boundary line. The rest of\r\nPondoland, chiefly in virtue of a British protectorate established over\r\nall the coast region in 1885, was already more or less under British\r\ncontrol, and in 1894 it was annexed to the Cape in its entirety. Thus\r\nthe whole of Kaffraria was incorporated in Cape Colony, with the\r\nexception of some 1550 sq. m., then part of Noman's-land, annexed by\r\nNatal in 1866 and named Alfred county. To the wise administration of\r\nMajor Sir Henry G. Elliot, who served in Kaffraria in various official\r\ncapacities from 1877 to 1903, the country owes much of its prosperity.\r\n\r\nParticulars concerning each of the four divisions of Kaffraria follow.\r\n\r\n  _Griqualand East_ (area, 7594 sq. m.), so called to distinguish it\r\n  from Griqualand West, a district north of the Orange River, lies\r\n  between Basutoland (N.W.), Natal (N.E.), Tembuland (S.W.) and\r\n  Pondoland (S.E.). It occupies the southern slopes of the Drakensberg\r\n  or the fertile valleys at their feet. It includes most of the region\r\n  formerly called Noman's-land, and afterwards named Adam Kok's Land\r\n  from the Griqua chief who occupied it in 1862 with the consent of the\r\n  British authorities, and governed the country till his death in 1876,\r\n  establishing a _volksraad_ on the Dutch model. The Griquas are still\r\n  ruled by an officially appointed headman. The majority of the\r\n  inhabitants are Basutos and Kaffirs (Pondomisi, Ama-Baka and other\r\n  tribes). The Griquas number about 6000. Since its annexation to Cape\r\n  Colony Griqualand East has made fairly rapid progress. The population\r\n  rose from 121,000 in 1881 to 222,685 in 1904, of whom 5901 were\r\n  whites. Stock-breeding on the uplands, tillage on the lower slopes of\r\n  the Drakensberg, are the chief industries. On these slopes and uplands\r\n  the climate is delightful and well suited to Europeans. There is\r\n  considerable trade with Basutoland in grain and stock, and through\r\n  Kokstad with Port St John and Port Shepstone, Natal. Much of the best\r\n  agricultural land is owned by Europeans.\r\n\r\n  _Tembuland_ (area, 4122 sq. m.), which lies S.W. of Griqualand East\r\n  and comprises the districts of Tembuland Proper, Emigrant Tembuland\r\n  and Bomvanaland, takes its name from, the Tembu nation, called\r\n  sometimes Tambookies, one of the most powerful of the Kaffir groups.\r\n  In the national genealogies the Tembu hold an honourable position,\r\n  being traditionally descended from Tembu, elder brother of Xosa, from\r\n  whom most of the other Kaffirs claim descent. The inhabitants\r\n  increased from about 160,000 in 1881 to 231,472 in 1904, of whom 8056\r\n  were whites. The chief town is Umtata.\r\n\r\n  _Transkei_ (area, 2552 sq. m.) comprises the districts of Fingoland,\r\n  the Idutywa Reserve and Gcalekaland, this last being named from the\r\n  Gcaleka nation, who claim to be the senior branch of the Xosa family,\r\n  the principal royal line of the Kaffir tribes. They still form the\r\n  chief element of the population, which rose from 136,000 in 1881 to\r\n  177,730 in 1904 (1707 whites). Here are some prosperous missionary\r\n  stations, where the natives are taught agriculture, mechanical\r\n  industries and a knowledge of letters. The heroic deeds of Hinza,\r\n  Kreli and other chiefs famous in the wars are still remembered; but\r\n  witchcraft, rain-making and other pagan practices seem to have died\r\n  out. Even more advanced in all social respects are the Fingo, who give\r\n  their name to the district of Fingoland, and also form the bulk of the\r\n  population in the Idutywa Reserve. They wear European clothes, support\r\n  their schools by voluntary contributions, edit newspapers, translate\r\n  English poetry, set their national songs to correct music, and the\r\n  majority profess Christianity. The industrial institution of\r\n  Blythswood, about 20 m. N.W. of Butterworth, is a branch of Lovedale\r\n  (q.v.), and is largely supported by the Fingo.\r\n\r\n  _Pondoland_ (area, 4040 sq. m.; pop. (1904), 202,757 (including 1113\r\n  whites), an estimated increase of 36,000 since 1891) is bounded E. by\r\n  the sea, N. by Natal, W. by Griqualand East, by S. and Tembuland. In\r\n  Pondoland the primitive organization of the natives has been little\r\n  altered and the influence of the chiefs is very great. Land is held\r\n  almost wholly in tribal tenure, though a number of whites possess\r\n  farms acquired before the annexation of the country. The Pondo have\r\n  shown some appreciation of the benefits of education.\r\n\r\n  See G. McCall Theal's _History of South Africa_ and other works cited\r\n  under CAPE COLONY; also _The Native or Transkeian Territories_, by C.\r\n  C. Henkel (Hamburg, 1903), a useful handbook by an ex-official in the\r\n  Transkeian Territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAFIRISTAN, a province of Afghanistan. Very little of this country was\r\nknown with accuracy and nothing at first hand until General Sir W.\r\n(then Colonel) Lockhart headed a mission to examine the passes of the\r\nHindu Kush range in 1885-1886. He penetrated into the upper part of the\r\nBashgal valley, but after a few days he found himself compelled to\r\nreturn to Chitral. Previously Major Tanner, R.A., had sought to enter\r\nKafiristan from Jalalabad, but sudden severe illness cut short his\r\nenterprise. M'Nair, the famous explorer of the Indian Survey department,\r\nbelieved that he had actually visited this little-known land during an\r\nadventurous journey which he made from India and through Chitral in\r\ndisguise; but the internal evidence of his reports shows that he mistook\r\nthe Kalash district of Chitral, with its debased and idolatrous\r\npopulation, for the true Kafiristan of his hopes. In 1889 Mr G. S.\r\nRobertson (afterwards Sir George Robertson, K.C.S.I.) was sent on a\r\nmission to Kafiristan. He only remained a few days, but a year later he\r\nrevisited the country, staying amongst the Kafirs for nearly a year.\r\nAlthough his movements were hampered, his presence in the country being\r\nregarded with suspicion, he was able to study the people, and, in spite\r\nof intertribal jealousy, to meet members of many of the tribes. The\r\nfacts observed and the information collected by him during his sojourn\r\nin eastern Kafiristan, and during short expeditions to the inner\r\nvalleys, are the most trustworthy foundations of our knowledge of this\r\ninteresting country.\r\n\r\nKafiristan, which literally means \"the land of the infidel,\" is the name\r\ngiven to a tract of country enclosed between Chitral and Afghan\r\nterritory. It was formerly peopled by pagan mountaineers, who maintained\r\na wild independence until 1895, when they were finally subdued by Abdur\r\nRahman, the amir of Kabul, who also compelled them to accept the\r\nreligion of Islam. The territory thus ill named is included between 34\r\ndeg. 30' and 36 deg. N., and from about 70 deg. to 71 deg. 30' E. As the\r\nwestern and northern boundaries are imperfectly known, its size cannot\r\nbe estimated with any certainty. Its greatest extent is from east to\r\nwest at 35 deg. 10' N.; its greatest breadth is probably about 71 deg.\r\nE. The total area approximates to 5000 sq. m. Along the N. the boundary\r\nis the province of Badakshan, on the N.E. the Lutkho valley of Chitral.\r\nChitral and lower Chitral enclose it to the E., and the Kunar valley on\r\nthe S.E. Afghanistan proper supplies the S. limit. The ranges above the\r\nNijrao and Pansher valleys of Afghanistan wall it in upon the W. The\r\nnorthern frontier is split by the narrow Minjan valley of Badakshan,\r\nwhich seems to rise in the very heart of Kafiristan.\r\n\r\n  Speaking generally, the country consists of an irregular series of\r\n  main valleys, for the most part deep, narrow and tortuous, into which\r\n  a varying number of still deeper, narrower and more twisted valleys,\r\n  ravines and glens pour their torrent water. The mountain ranges of\r\n  Metamorphic rock, which separate the main drainage valleys, are all of\r\n  considerable altitude, rugged and difficult, with the outline of a\r\n  choppy sea petrified. During the winter months, when the snow lies\r\n  deep, Kafiristan becomes a number of isolated communities, with few if\r\n  any means of intercommunication. In the whole land there is probably\r\n  nothing in the shape of a plain. Much of the silent, gigantic country\r\n  warms the heart as well as captivates the eye with its grandeur and\r\n  varied beauty; much of it is the bare skeleton of the world wasted by\r\n  countless centuries of storms and frost, and profoundly melancholy in\r\n  its sempiternal ruin. Every variety of mountain scenery can be found:\r\n  silent peaks and hard, naked ridges, snowfields and glaciers; mighty\r\n  pine forests, wooded slopes and grazing grounds; or wild vine and\r\n  pomegranate thickets bordering sparkling streams. At low elevations\r\n  the hill-sides are covered with the wild olive and evergreen oaks.\r\n  Many kinds of fruit trees--walnuts, mulberries, apricots and\r\n  apples--grow near the villages or by the wayside, as well as splendid\r\n  horse-chestnuts and other shade trees. Higher in elevation, and from\r\n  4000 to 8000 ft., are the dense pine and cedar forests. Above this\r\n  altitude the slopes become dreary, the juniper, cedar and wild rhubarb\r\n  gradually giving place to scanty willow patches, tamarisk and stunted\r\n  birches. Over 13,000 ft. there are merely mosses and rough grass.\r\n  Familiar wildflowers blossom at different heights. The rivers teem\r\n  with fish. Immense numbers of red-legged partridges live in the lower\r\n  valleys, as well as pigeons and doves. Gorgeously plumaged pheasants\r\n  are plentiful. Of wild animals the chief are the _markhor_ (a goat)\r\n  and the _oorial_ (a sheep). In the winter the former are recklessly\r\n  slaughtered by hunters, being either brought to bay by trained hounds,\r\n  or trapped in pits, or caught floundering in the snow-drifts; but in\r\n  the summer immense herds move on the higher slopes. The _ibex_ is very\r\n  rare. Bears and leopards are fairly common, as well as the smaller\r\n  hill creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Passes and Roads.\r\n\r\n  All the northern passes leading into Badakshan or into the Minjan\r\n  valley of Badakshan seem to be over 15,000 ft. in altitude. Of these\r\n  the chief are the Mandal, the Kamah (these two alone have been\r\n  explored by a European traveller), the Kti, the Kulam and the Ramgal\r\n  passes. Those to the east, the Chitral passes, are somewhat lower,\r\n  ranging from 12,000 to 14,000 ft., e.g. the Zidig, the Shui, the\r\n  Shawal and the Parpit, while the Patkun, which crosses one of the\r\n  dwindled spurs near the Kunar river, is only 8400 ft. high. Between\r\n  neighbouring valleys the very numerous communicating footways must\r\n  rarely be lower than 10,000, while they sometimes exceed 14,000 ft.\r\n  The western passes are unknown. All these toilsome paths are so\r\n  faintly indicated, even when free from snow, that to adventure them\r\n  without a local guide is usually unsafe. Yet the light-framed cattle\r\n  of these jagged mountains can be forced over many of the worst passes.\r\n  Ordinarily the herding tracks, near the crest of the ridges and high\r\n  above the white torrents, are scarcely discoverable to untutored eyes.\r\n  They wind and waver, rise, drop and twist about the irregular\r\n  semi-precipitous slopes with baffling eccentricity and abruptness.\r\n  Nevertheless the cattle nose their way along blunderingly, but without\r\n  hurt. Of no less importance in the open months, and the sole trade\r\n  routes during winter, are the lower paths by the river. An unguided\r\n  traveller is continually at fault upon these main lines of intercourse\r\n  and traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rivers.\r\n\r\n  All the rivers find their tumultuous way into the Kabul, either\r\n  directly, as the Alingar at Laghman, or after commingling with the\r\n  Kunar at Arundu and at Chigar-Serai. The Bashgal, draining the eastern\r\n  portion of the country, empties itself into the Kunar at Arundu. It\r\n  draws its highest waters from three main sources at the head of the\r\n  Bashgal valley. It glides gently through a lake close to this origin,\r\n  and then through a smaller tarn. The first affluent of importance is\r\n  the Skorigal, which joins it above the village of Pshui. Next comes\r\n  the noisier Manangal water, from the Shawal pass, which enters the\r\n  main stream at Lutdeh or Bragamatal, the chief settlement of the\r\n  Bashgal branch of the Katir tribe. By-and-by the main stream becomes,\r\n  at the hamlet of Sunra, a raging, shrieking torrent in a dark narrow\r\n  valley, its run obstructed by giant boulders and great tree-trunks.\r\n  Racing past Bagalgrom, the chief village of the Madugal Kafirs, the\r\n  river clamours round the great spur which, 1800 ft. higher up, gives\r\n  space for the terraces and houses of Kamdesh, the headquarters of the\r\n  Kam people. The next important affluent is the river which drains the\r\n  Pittigal valley, its passes and branches. Also on the left bank, and\r\n  still lower down, is the joining-place of the Gourdesh valley waters.\r\n  Finally it ends in the Kunar just above Arundu and Birkot. The middle\r\n  part of Kafiristan, including the valleys occupied by the Presun, Kti,\r\n  Ashkun and Wai tribes, is drained by a river variously called the\r\n  Pech, the Kamah, and the Presun or Viron River. It has been only\r\n  partially explored. Fed by the fountains and snows of the upper Presun\r\n  valley, it is joined at the village of Shtevgrom by the torrent from\r\n  the Kamah pass. Thence it moves quietly past meadowland, formerly set\r\n  apart as holy ground, watering on its way all the Presun villages.\r\n  Below the last of them, with an abrupt bend, it hurries into the\r\n  unexplored and rockbound Tsaru country, where it absorbs on the right\r\n  hand the Kti and the Ashkun and on the left the Wai rivers, finally\r\n  losing itself in the Kunar, close to Chigar-Serai. Concerning the\r\n  Alingar or Kao, which carries the drainage of western Kafiristan into\r\n  the Kabul at Laghman, there are no trustworthy details. It is formed\r\n  from the waters of all the valleys inhabited by the Ramgal Kafirs, and\r\n  by that small branch of the Katirs known as the Kalam tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Climate.\r\n\r\n  The climate varies with the altitude, but in the summer-time it is hot\r\n  at all elevations. In the higher valleys the winter is rigorous. Snow\r\n  falls heavily everywhere over 4000 ft. above the sea-level. During the\r\n  winter of 1890-1891 at Kamdesh (elevation 6100 ft.) the thermometer\r\n  never fell below 17 deg. F. In many of the valleys the absence of wind\r\n  is remarkable. Consequently a great deal of cold can be borne without\r\n  discomfort. The Kunar valley, which is wet and windy in winter, but\r\n  where snow, if it falls, melts quickly, gives a much greater sensation\r\n  of cold than the still Kafiristan valleys of much lower actual\r\n  temperature. A deficiency of rain necessitates the employment of a\r\n  somewhat elaborate system of irrigation, which in its turn is\r\n  dependent upon the snowfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Kafirs.\r\n\r\nThe present inhabitants are probably mainly descended from the broken\r\ntribes of eastern Afghanistan, who, refusing to accept Islam (in the\r\n10th century), were driven away by the fervid swordsmen of Mahomet.\r\nDescending upon the feeble inhabitants of the trackless slopes and\r\nperilous valleys of modern Kafiristan, themselves, most likely, refugees\r\nof an earlier date, they subjugated and enslaved them and partially\r\namalgamated with them. These ancient peoples seem to be represented by\r\nthe Presun tribe, by the slaves and by fragments of lost peoples, now\r\nknown as the Jazhis and the Aroms. The old division of the tribes into\r\nthe Siah-Posh, or the black-robed Kafirs, and the Safed-Posh, or the\r\nwhite-robed, was neither scientific nor convenient, for while the\r\nSiah-Posh have much in common in dress, language, customs and\r\nappearance, the Safed-Posh divisions were not more dissimilar from the\r\nSiah-Posh than they were from one another. Perhaps the best division at\r\npresent possible is into (1) Siah-Posh, (2) Waigulis, and (3)\r\nPresungalis or Viron folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Siah-Posh.\r\n\r\n  The black-robed Kafirs consist of one very large, widely spread tribe,\r\n  the Katirs, and four much smaller communities, the Kam, the Madugalis,\r\n  the Kashtan or Kashtoz, and the Gourdesh. Numerically, it is probable\r\n  that the Katirs are more important than all the remaining tribes put\r\n  together. They inhabit several valleys, each community being\r\n  independent of the others, but all acknowledging the same origin and a\r\n  general relationship. The Katirs fall readily into the following\r\n  groups: (a) Those of the Bashgal valley, also called Kamoz and\r\n  Lutdehchis, who occupy eleven villages between Badawan and Sunra, the\r\n  border hamlet of the Madugal country, namely, Ptsigrom, Pshui or\r\n  Pshowar, Apsai, Shidgal, Bragamatal (Lutdeh), Bajindra, Badamuk,\r\n  Oulagal, Chabu, Baprok and Purstam; (b) the Kti or Katwar Kafirs, who\r\n  live in two settlements in the Kti valley; (c) the Kulam people, who\r\n  have four villages in the valley of the same name; (d) the Ramgalis,\r\n  or Gabariks, who are the most numerous, and possess the western part\r\n  on the Afghan border. Of the remaining tribes of the Siah-Posh, the\r\n  chief is the Kam or Kamtoz, who inhabit the Bashgal valley, from the\r\n  Madugal boundary to the Kunar valley, and its lateral branches in\r\n  seven chief settlements, namely, Urmir, Kambrom or Kamdesh, Mergrom,\r\n  Kamu, Sarat, Pittigal and Bazgal. The next Siah-Posh tribe in\r\n  importance is the Muman or Madugal Kafirs, who have three villages in\r\n  the short tract between the Katirs and the Kam in the Bashgal valley.\r\n  The last Siah-Posh tribe is the Kashtan or Kashtoz, who in 1891 were\r\n  all located in one greatly overcrowded village, their outlying\r\n  settlement having been plundered by the Afghan tribes of the Kunar\r\n  valley. One colony of Siah-Posh Kafirs lives in the Gourdesh valley;\r\n  but they differ from all the other tribes, and are believed to be\r\n  descended, in great part, from the ancient people called the Aroms.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Waigulis.\r\n\r\n  Our exact knowledge of the Waigulis is scanty. They seem to be related\r\n  in language and origin with a people fierce, shy and isolated, called\r\n  the Ashkun, who are quite unknown. The Wai speak a tongue altogether\r\n  different from that spoken by the Siah-Posh and by the Presungalis.\r\n  The names of their ten chief villages are Runchi, Nishi, Jamma, Amzhi,\r\n  Chimion, Kegili, Akun or Akum, Mildesh, Bargal and Prainta. Of these\r\n  Amzhi and Nishi are the best known.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Presungalis.\r\n\r\n  The Presungalis, also called Viron, live in a high valley. In all\r\n  respects they differ from other Kafirs, in none more than in their\r\n  unwarlike disposition. Simple, timid, stolid-featured and rather\r\n  clumsy, they are remarkable for their industry and powers of\r\n  endurance. They probably represent some of the earliest immigrants.\r\n  Six large well-built villages are occupied by them--Shtevgrom,\r\n  Pontzgrom, Diogrom, Kstigigrom, Satsumgrom and Paskigrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Slaves.\r\n\r\n  The slaves are fairly numerous. Their origin is probably partly from\r\n  the very ancient inhabitants and partly from war prisoners. Coarse in\r\n  feature and dark in tint, they cannot be distinguished from the lowest\r\n  class of freemen, while their dress is indistinctive. They are of two\r\n  classes--household slaves, who are treated not unkindly; and artisan\r\n  slaves, who are the skilled handicraftsmen--carvers, blacksmiths,\r\n  bootmakers and so forth; many of the musicians are also slaves. They\r\n  live in a particular portion of a village, and were considered to a\r\n  certain extent unclean, and might not approach closely to certain\r\n  sacred spots. All slaves seem to wear the Siah-Posh dress, even when\r\n  they own as masters the feeble Presungal folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Women.\r\n\r\n  Little respect is shown to women, except in particular cases to a few\r\n  of advanced years. Usually they are mistresses and slaves, saleable\r\n  chattels and field-workers. Degraded, immoral, overworked and\r\n  carelessly fed, they are also, as a rule, unpleasant to the sight.\r\n  Little girls are sometimes quite beautiful, but rough usage and\r\n  exposure to all weathers soon make their complexions coarse and dark.\r\n  They are invariably dirty and uncombed. In comparison with the men\r\n  they are somewhat short. Physically they are capable of enormous\r\n  labour, and are very enduring. All the field-work falls to them, as\r\n  well as all kinds of inferior occupations, such as load-carrying. They\r\n  have no rights as against their husbands or, failing them, their male\r\n  relations. They cannot inherit or possess property.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Language.\r\n\r\n  There are certainly three tongues spoken, besides many dialects, that\r\n  used by the Siah-Posh being of course the most common; and although it\r\n  has many dialects, the employers of one seem to understand all the\r\n  others. It is a Prakritic language. Of the remaining two, the Wai and\r\n  the Presun have no similarity; they are also unlike the Siah-Posh.\r\n  Kafirs themselves maintain that very young children from any valley\r\n  can acquire the Wai speech, but that only those born in the Presungal\r\n  can ever converse in that language, even roughly. To European ears it\r\n  is disconcertingly difficult, and it is perhaps impossible to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Religion.\r\n\r\n  Before their conquest by Abdur Rahman all the Kafirs were idolaters of\r\n  a rather low type. There were lingering traces of ancestor-worship,\r\n  and perhaps of fire-worship also. The gods were numerous; tribal,\r\n  family, household deities had to be propitiated, and mischievous\r\n  spirits and fairies haunted forests, rivers, vales and great stones.\r\n  Imra was the Creator, and all the other supernatural powers were\r\n  subordinate to him. Of the inferior gods, Moni seemed to be the most\r\n  ancient; but Gish, the war-god, was by far the most popular. It was\r\n  his worship, doubtless, which kept the Kafirs so long independent. In\r\n  life as a hero, and after death as a god, he symbolized hatred to the\r\n  religion of Mahomet. Every village revered his shrine; some possessed\r\n  two. Imra, Gish and Moni were honoured with separate little temples,\r\n  as was usually Dizani goddess; but three or four of the others would\r\n  share one between them, each looking out of a small separate square\r\n  window. The worshipped object was either a large fragment of stone or\r\n  an image of wood conventionally carved, with round white stones for\r\n  eyes. Different animals were sacrificed at different shrines: cows to\r\n  Imra, male goats and bulls to Gish, sheep to the god of wealth; but\r\n  goats were generally acceptable, and were also slain ceremonially to\r\n  discover a complaisant god, to solemnize a vow, to end a quarrel, to\r\n  ratify brotherhood. The ministers of religion were a hereditary\r\n  priest, a well-born chanter of praise, and a buffoon of low station,\r\n  who was supposed to become inspired at each sacrifice, and to have the\r\n  power of seeing fairies and other spirits whenever they were near,\r\n  also of understanding their wishes. The blood of the offering,\r\n  together with flour, wine and butter, was cast on the shrine after the\r\n  animal and the other gifts had been sanctified with water sprinkled by\r\n  the officiating priests, while he cried \"Such, such!\" (\"Be pure!\").\r\n  Dense clouds of smoke from burning juniper-cedar, which crackled and\r\n  gave forth pungent incense, added to the spectacle, which was\r\n  dignified by the bearing of the officials and solemnized by the devout\r\n  responses of the congregation. There was no human sacrifice except\r\n  when a prisoner of war, after a solemn service at a shrine, was taken\r\n  away and stabbed before the wooden tomb of some unavenged headman.\r\n  Kafirs believed in a kind of Hell where wicked people burned; but the\r\n  Hereafter was an underground region entered by a guarded aperture, and\r\n  inhabited by the shapes which men see in dreams. Suicide was as\r\n  unknown as fear of dying. Melancholy afflicted only the sick and the\r\n  bereaved. Religious traditions, miracles and anecdotes were puerile,\r\n  and pointed no social lesson or any religious law. Music, dancing and\r\n  songs of praise were acceptable to the gods, and every village\r\n  (_grom_) had its dancing platform and dancing house (_grom ma_),\r\n  furnished with a simple altar. No prayers were offered, only\r\n  invocations, exhortative or remonstrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tribal Organization.\r\n\r\n  The great majority of the tribes were made up of clans. A person's\r\n  importance was derived chiefly from the wealth of his family and the\r\n  number of male adults which it contained. The power of a family, as\r\n  shown by the number and quality of its fighting men as well as by the\r\n  strength of its followers, was the index of that family's influence.\r\n  Weak clans and detached families, or poor but free households, carried\r\n  their independence modestly. The lowest clan above the slaves sought\r\n  service with their wealthier tribesmen as henchmen and armed\r\n  shepherds. By intricate ceremonial, associated with complicated\r\n  duties, social and religious, which extended over two years,\r\n  punctuated at intervals by prodigious compulsory banquets, rich men\r\n  could become elders or _jast_. Still further outlay and ostentation\r\n  enabled the few who could sustain the cost to rank still higher as\r\n  chief or _Mir_. Theoretically, all the important and outside affairs\r\n  of the tribe were managed by the _jast_ in council; actually they were\r\n  controlled by two or three of the most respected of that class. Very\r\n  serious questions which inflamed the minds of the people would be\r\n  debated in informal parliaments of the whole tribe. Kafirs have a\r\n  remarkable fondness for discussing in conclave. Orators, consequently,\r\n  are influential. The internal business of a tribe was managed by an\r\n  elected magistrate with twelve assistants. It was their duty to see\r\n  that the customs of the people were respected; that the proper seasons\r\n  for gathering fruit were rigidly observed. They regulated the\r\n  irrigation of the fields, moderating the incessant quarrels which\r\n  originated in the competition for the water; and they kept the\r\n  channels in good repair. Their chief, helped by contributions in kind\r\n  from all householders, entertained tribal guests. He also saw that the\r\n  weekly Kafir Sabbath, from the sowing to the carrying of the crops,\r\n  was carefully observed, the fires kept burning, and the dancers\r\n  collected and encouraged. Opposition to these annual magistrates or\r\n  infraction of tribal laws was punished by fines, which were the\r\n  perquisites and the payment of those officials. Serious offences\r\n  against the whole people were judged by the community itself; the\r\n  sentences ranged as high as expulsion from the settlement, accompanied\r\n  with the burning of the culprit's house and the spoliation of his\r\n  goods. In such cases, the family and the clan refusing to intervene,\r\n  the offender at once became cowed into submission.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Houses and Villages.\r\n\r\n  Habitations are generally strong, and built largely of wood. They are\r\n  frequently two or more storeys high, often with an open gallery at the\r\n  top. Wealthy owners were fond of elaborate carving in simple designs\r\n  and devices. A room is square, with a smoke-hole when possible; small\r\n  windows, with shutters and bolts, and heavy doors fastened by a\r\n  sliding wooden pin, are common. The nature of the ground, its\r\n  defensible character, the necessity of not encroaching upon the scanty\r\n  arable land, and such considerations, determine the design of the\r\n  villages. Specimens of many varieties may be discovered. There is the\r\n  shockingly overcrowded oblong kind, fort-shaped, three storeys high,\r\n  and on a river's bank, which is pierced by an underground way leading\r\n  to the water. Here all rooms look on to the large central courtyard;\r\n  outwards are few or no windows. There is also the tiny hamlet of a few\r\n  piled-up hovels perched on the flattish top of some huge rock,\r\n  inaccessible when the ladder connecting it with the neighbouring\r\n  hill-side or leading to the ground is withdrawn. Some villages on\r\n  mounds are defended at the base by a circular wall strengthened with\r\n  an entanglement of branches. Others cling to the knife-edged back of\r\n  some difficult spur. Many are hidden away up side ravines. A few\r\n  boldly rely upon the numbers of their fighting men, and are\r\n  unprotected save by watch-towers. While frequently very picturesque at\r\n  a distance, all are dirty and grimed with smoke; bones and horns of\r\n  slaughtered animals litter the ground. The ground floor of a house is\r\n  usually a winter stable for cows and the latrine, as well as the\r\n  manure store for the household; the middle part contains the family\r\n  treasures; on the top is the living-place. In cold valleys, such as\r\n  the Presungal, the houses are often clustered upon a hillock, and\r\n  penetrate into the soil to the depth of two or more apartments.\r\n  Notched poles are the universal ladders and stairways.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Characteristics.\r\n\r\n  In height Kafirs average about 5 ft. 6 in. They are lean; always in\r\n  hard condition; active jumpers, untiring walkers, expert mountaineers;\r\n  exceptionally they are tall and heavy. With chests fairly deep, and\r\n  muscular, springy legs, there is some lightness and want of power\r\n  about the shoulder muscles, the arms and the hand-grasp. In complexion\r\n  they are purely Eastern. Some tribes, notably the Wai, are fairer than\r\n  others, but the average colour is that of the natives of the Punjab.\r\n  Albinos, or red-haired people, number less than (1/2)% of the\r\n  population. As a rule, the features are well-shaped, especially the\r\n  nose. The glance is wild and bold, with the wide-lidded, restless gaze\r\n  of the hawk; or the exact converse--a shifty, furtive peer under\r\n  lowered brows. This look is rather common amongst the wealthier\r\n  families and the most famous tribesmen. The shape of a man's head not\r\n  uncommonly indicates his social rank. Several have the brows of\r\n  thinkers and men of affairs. The degraded forms are the bird-of-prey\r\n  type--low, hairy foreheads, hooked noses with receding chin, or the\r\n  thickened, coarse features of the darker slave class. Intellectually\r\n  they are of good average power. Their moral characteristics are\r\n  passionate covetousness, and jealousy so intense that it smothers\r\n  prudence. Before finally destroying, it constantly endangered their\r\n  wildly cherished independence. Revenge, especially on neighbouring\r\n  Kafirs, is obtained at any price. Kafirs are subtle, crafty, quick in\r\n  danger and resolute, as might be expected of people who have been\r\n  plunderers and assassins for centuries, whose lives were the forfeit\r\n  of a fault in unflinchingness or of a moment's vacillation. Stealthy\r\n  daring, born of wary and healthy nerves and the training of\r\n  generations, almost transformed into an instinct, is the national\r\n  characteristic. Ghastly shadows, they flitted in the precincts of\r\n  hostile villages far distant from their own valleys, living upon the\r\n  poorest food carried in a fetid goatskin bag; ever ready to stab in\r\n  the darkness or to wriggle through apertures, to slay as they slept\r\n  men, women and babies. Then, with clothing for prize, and human ears\r\n  as a trophy, they sped, watchful as hares, for their far-away hills,\r\n  avenger Pathans racing furiously in their track. Kafirs, most faithful\r\n  to one another, never abandoned a comrade. If he were killed, they\r\n  sought to carry away his head for funeral observances. As traders,\r\n  though cunning enough, they are no match for the Afghan. They were\r\n  more successful as brigands and blackmailers than as skilled thieves.\r\n  In night robbery and in pilfering they showed little ingenuity. Truth\r\n  was considered innately dangerous; but a Kafir is far more trustworthy\r\n  than his Mahommedan neighbours. Although hospitality is generally\r\n  viewed as a hopeful investment, it can be calculated on, and is\r\n  unstinted. Kafirs are capable of strong friendship. They are not\r\n  cruel, being kind to children and to animals, and protective to the\r\n  weak and the old. Family ties and the claim of blood even triumph over\r\n  jealousy and covetousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dress, Weapons, Utensils, &c.\r\n\r\n  The national attire of the men is a badly-cured goatskin, confined at\r\n  the waist by a leather belt studded with nails, supporting the\r\n  I-hilted dagger, strong but clumsy, of slave manufacture, sheathed in\r\n  wood covered with iron or brass, and often prettily ornamented. Women\r\n  are dressed in a long, very dark tunic of wool, ample below the\r\n  shoulders, and edged with red. This is fastened at the bosom by an\r\n  iron pin, a thorn, or a fibula; it is gathered round the body by a\r\n  woven band, an inch wide, knotted in front to dangle down in tassels.\r\n  On this girdle is carried a fantastically handled knife in a leather\r\n  covering. The woman's tunic is sometimes worn by men. As worn by women\r\n  its shape is something between a long frock-coat and an Inverness\r\n  cape. Its hue and the blackness of the hairy goatskin give the name of\r\n  Siah-Posh, \"black-robed,\" to the majority of the clans. The other\r\n  tribes wear such articles of cotton attire as they can obtain by\r\n  barter, by theft, or by killing beyond the border, for only woollen\r\n  cloth is made in the country. Of late years long robes from Chitral\r\n  and Badakshan have been imported by the wealthy, as well as the\r\n  material for loose cotton trousers and wide shirts. Clothing, always\r\n  hard to obtain, is precious property. Formerly little girls, the\r\n  children of slaves, or else poor relations, used to be sold in\r\n  exchange for clothes and ammunition. Mahommedans eagerly bought the\r\n  children, which enabled them in one transaction to acquire a female\r\n  slave and to convert an infidel. Men go bareheaded, which wrinkles\r\n  them prematurely, or they wear Chitral caps. Certain priests, and\r\n  others of like degree, wind a strip of cotton cloth round their brows.\r\n  Siah-Posh women wear curious horned caps or a small square white\r\n  head-dress upon informal occasions. Females of other tribes bind their\r\n  heads with turbans ornamented with shells and other finery. Excellent\r\n  snow gaiters are made of goat's hair for both sexes, and of woollen\r\n  material for women. Boots, strongly sewn, of soft red leather cannot\r\n  be used in the snow or when it is wet, because they are imperfectly\r\n  tanned. For the ceremonial dances all manner of gay-coloured articles\r\n  of attire, made of cheap silk, cotton velvet, and sham cloth-of-gold,\r\n  are displayed, and false jewelry and tawdry ornaments; but they are\r\n  not manufactured in the country, but brought from Peshawar by pedlars.\r\n  Woollen blankets and goat's-hair mats cover the bedsteads--four-legged\r\n  wooden frames laced across with string or leather thongs. Low square\r\n  stools, 18 in. broad, made upon the same principle as the bedsteads,\r\n  are peculiar to the Kafirs and their half-breed neighbours of the\r\n  border. Iron tripod tables, singularly Greek in design, are fashioned\r\n  in Waigul. A warrior's weapons are a matchlock (rarely a flintlock), a\r\n  bow and arrows, a spear and the dagger which he never puts aside day\r\n  or night. The axes, often carried, are light and weak, and chiefly\r\n  indicate rank. Clubs, carefully ornamented by carving, are of little\r\n  use in a quarrel; their purpose is that of a walking-stick. As they\r\n  are somewhat long, these walking-clubs have been often supposed to be\r\n  leaping-poles. Swords are rarely seen, and shields, carried purely for\r\n  ostentation, seldom. Soft stone is quarried to make large utensils,\r\n  and great grim chests of wood become grain boxes or coffins\r\n  indifferently. Prettily carved bowls with handles, or with dummy\r\n  spouts, hold milk, butter, water or small quantities of flour. Wine,\r\n  grain, everything else, is stored or carried in goatskin bags. Musical\r\n  instruments are represented by reed flageolets, small drums, primitive\r\n  fiddles, and a kind of harp.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Peculiar Customs.\r\n\r\n  Isolated and at the outskirts of every village is a house used by\r\n  women when menstruating and for lying-in. Children are named as soon\r\n  as born. The infant is given to the mother to suckle, while a wise\r\n  woman rapidly recites the family ancestral names; the name pronounced\r\n  at the instant the baby begins to feed is that by which it is\r\n  thereafter known. Everybody has a double name, the father's being\r\n  prefixed to that given at birth. Very often the two are the same.\r\n  There is a special day for the first head-shaving. No hair is allowed\r\n  on a male's scalp, except from a 4-in. circle at the back of the head,\r\n  whence long locks hang down straight. Puberty is attained\r\n  ceremoniously by boys. Girls simply change a fillet for a cotton cap\r\n  when nature proclaims womanhood. Marriage is merely the purchase of a\r\n  wife through intermediaries, accompanied by feasting. Divorce is often\r\n  merely a sale or the sending away of a wife to slave for her parents\r\n  in shame. Sexual morality is low. Public opinion applauds gallantry,\r\n  and looks upon adultery as hospitality, provided it is not discovered\r\n  by the husband. If found out, _in flagrante delicto_, there is a\r\n  fiscal fine in cows. There is much collusion to get this penalty paid\r\n  in poor households. Funeral rites are most elaborate, according to the\r\n  rank and warrior fame of the deceased, if a male, and to the wealth\r\n  and standing of the family, if a woman. Children are simply carried to\r\n  the cemetery in a blanket, followed by a string of women lamenting. A\r\n  really great man is mourned over for days with orations, dancing,\r\n  wine-drinking and food distribution. Gun-firing gives notice of the\r\n  procession. After two or three days the corpse is placed in the coffin\r\n  at a secluded spot, and the observances are continued with a straw\r\n  figure lashed upon a bed, to be danced about, lamented over, and\r\n  harangued as before. During regular intervals for business and\r\n  refreshment old women wail genealogies. A year later, with somewhat\r\n  similar ritual, a wooden statue is inaugurated preliminary to erection\r\n  on the roadside or in the village Valhalla. The dead are not buried,\r\n  but deposited in great boxes collected in an assigned place. Finery is\r\n  placed with the body, as well as vessels holding water and food.\r\n  Several corpses may be heaped in one receptacle, which is, rarely,\r\n  ornamented with flags; its lid is kept from warping by heavy stones.\r\n  The wooden statues or effigies are at times sacrificed to when there\r\n  is sickness, and at one of the many annual festivals food is set\r\n  before them. Among the Presungal there are none of these images.\r\n  Blood-feuds within a tribe do not exist. The slayer of his fellow,\r\n  even by accident, has to pay a heavy compensation or else become an\r\n  outcast. Several hamlets and at least one village are peopled by\r\n  families who had thus been driven forth from the community. The stigma\r\n  attaches itself to children and their marriage connexions. Its outward\r\n  symbol is an inability to look in the face any of the dead person's\r\n  family. This avoidance is ceremonial. In private and after dark all\r\n  may be good friends after a decorous interval. The compensation is\r\n  seldom paid, although payment carries with it much enhancement of\r\n  family dignity. All the laws to punish theft, assault, adultery and\r\n  other injury are based on a system of compensation whenever possible,\r\n  and of enlisting the whole of the community in all acts of punishment.\r\n  Kafirs have true conceptions of justice. There is no death penalty; a\r\n  fighting male is too valuable a property of the whole tribe to be so\r\n  wasted. War begins honourably with proper notice, as a rule, but the\r\n  murder of an unsuspecting traveller may be the first intimation.\r\n  Bullets or arrow-heads sent to a tribe or village is the correct\r\n  announcement of hostilities. The slaying of a tribesman need not in\r\n  all cases cause a war. Sometimes it may be avoided by the sinning\r\n  tribe handing over a male to be killed by the injured relations.\r\n  Ambush, early morning attacks by large numbers, and stealthy killing\r\n  parties of two or three are the favourite tactics. Peace is made by\r\n  the sacrifice of cows handed over by the weaker tribe to be offered up\r\n  to a special god of the stronger. When both sides have shown equal\r\n  force and address, the same number of animals are exchanged.\r\n  Field-work falls exclusively to the women. It is poor. The ploughs are\r\n  light and very shallow. A woman, who only looks as if she were yoked\r\n  with the ox, keeps the beast in the furrows, while a second holds the\r\n  handle. All the operations of agriculture are done primitively.\r\n  Grazing and dairy-farming are the real trade of the Kafirs, the\r\n  surplus produce being exchanged on the frontier or sold for Kabul\r\n  rupees. Herders watch their charges fully armed against marauders.\r\n\r\n_History._--The history of Kafiristan has always been of the floating\r\nlegendary sort. At the present day there are men living in Chitral and\r\non other parts of the Kafiristan frontier who are prepared to testify as\r\neye-witnesses to marvels observed, and also heard, by them, not only in\r\nthe more remote valleys but even in the Afghan borderland itself. It is\r\nnot surprising therefore that the earlier records are to a great extent\r\nfairy tales of a more or less imaginative kind and chiefly of value to\r\nthose interested in folk-lore. Sir Henry Yule, a scientific soldier, a\r\nprofound geographer and a careful student, as the result of his\r\nresearches thought that the present Kafiristan was part of that pagan\r\ncountry stretching between Kashmir and Kabul which medieval Asiatics\r\nreferred to vaguely as _Bilaur_, a name to be found in Marco Polo as\r\n_Bolor_. The first distinct mention of the Kafirs as a separate people\r\nappears in the history of Timur. On his march to the invasion of India\r\nthe people at Andarab appealed to Timur for help against the Kator and\r\nthe Siah-Posh Kafirs. He responded and entered the country of those\r\ntribes through the upper part of the Panjhir valley. It was in deep\r\nwinter weather and Timur had to be let down the snows by _glissade_ in a\r\nbasket guided by ropes. A detachment of 10,000 horse which he speaks of\r\nas having been sent against the Siah-Posh to his left, presumably\r\ntherefore to the north, met with disaster; but he himself claims to have\r\nbeen victorious. Nevertheless he seems quickly to have evacuated the\r\nimpracticable mountain land, quitting the country at Khawak. He caused\r\nan inscription to be carved in the defiles of Kator to commemorate his\r\ninvasion and to explain its route. Inside the Kafir country on the Najil\r\nor Alishang River there is a fort still called Timur's Castle, and in\r\nthe Kalam fort there is said to be a stone engraved to record that as\r\nthe farthest point of his advance. In the _Memoirs_ of Baber there is\r\nmention of the Kafirs raiding into Panjhir and of their taste for\r\ndrinking, every man having a leathern wine-bottle slung round his neck.\r\nThe _Ain-i-Akbari_ makes occasional mention of the Kafirs, probably on\r\nthe authority of the famous _Memoirs_; it also contains a passage which\r\nmay possibly have originated the widespread story that the Kafirs were\r\ndescendants of the Greeks. Yule however believed that this passage did\r\nnot refer to the Kafirs at all, but to the claims to descent from\r\nAlexander of the rulers in Swat before the time of the Yusufzai. Many of\r\nthe princelings of the little Hindu-Kush states at the present day pride\r\nthemselves on a similar origin, maintaining the founders of their race\r\nto be Alexander, \"the two-horned,\" and a princess sent down miraculously\r\nfrom heaven to wed him.\r\n\r\nBenedict Goes, travelling from Peshawar to Kabul in 1603, heard of a\r\nplace called _Capperstam_, where no Mahommedan might enter on pain of\r\ndeath. Hindu traders were allowed to visit the country, but not the\r\ntemples. Benedict Goes tasted the Kafir wine, and from all that he heard\r\nsuspected that the Kafirs might be Christians. Nothing more is heard of\r\nthe Kafirs until 1788, when Rennell's _Memoir of a Map of Hindostan_\r\nwas published. Twenty-six years later Elphinstone's _Caubal_ was\r\npublished. During the British occupation of Kabul in 1839-1840 a\r\ndeputation of Kafirs journeyed there to invite a visit to their country\r\nfrom the Christians whom they assumed to be their kindred. But the\r\nAfghans grew furiously jealous, and the deputation was sent coldly away.\r\n\r\nAfter Sir George Robertson's sojourn in the country and the visit of\r\nseveral Kafirs to India with him in 1892 an increasing intimacy\r\ncontinued, especially with the people of the eastern valleys, until\r\n1895, when by the terms of an agreement entered into between the\r\ngovernment of India and the ruler of Afghanistan the whole of the Kafir\r\nterritory came nominally under the sway of Kabul. The amir Abdur Rahman\r\nat once set about enforcing his authority, and the curtain, partially\r\nlifted, fell again heavily and in darkness. Nothing but rumours reached\r\nthe outside world, rumours of successful invasions, of the wholesale\r\ndeportation of boys to Kabul for instruction in the religion of Islam,\r\nof rebellions, of terrible repressions. Finally even rumour ceased. A\r\npowerful Asiatic ruler has the means of ensuring a silence which is\r\nabsolute, and nothing is ever known from Kabul except what the amir\r\nwishes to be known. Probably larger numbers of the growing boys and\r\nyoung men of Kafiristan are fanatical Mahommedans, fanatical with the\r\nzeal of the recent convert, while the older people and the majority of\r\nthe population cherish their ancient customs in secret and their\r\ndegraded religion in fear and trembling--waiting dumbly for a sign.\r\n\r\nSee Sir G. S. Robertson, _Kafirs of the Hindu-Kush_ (London, 1896).\r\n     (G. S. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAGERA, a river of east equatorial Africa, the most remote headstream of\r\nthe Nile. The sources of its principal upper branch, the Nyavarongo,\r\nrise in the hill country immediately east of Lake Kivu. After a course\r\nof over 400 m. the Kagera enters Victoria Nyanza on its western shore in\r\n0 deg. 58' S. It is navigable by steamers for 70 m. from its mouth, being\r\nobstructed by rapids above that point. The river was first heard of by\r\nJ. H. Speke in 1858, and was first seen (by white men) by the same\r\ntraveller (Jan. 16, 1862) on his journey to discover the Nile source.\r\nSpeke was well aware that the Kagera was the chief river emptying into\r\nthe Victoria Nyanza and in that sense _the_ headstream of the Nile. By\r\nhim the stream was called \"Kitangule,\" _kagera_ being given as\r\nequivalent to \"river.\" The exploration of the Kagera has been largely\r\nthe work of German travellers.\r\n\r\n  See NILE; also Speke's _Discovery of the Source of the Nile_\r\n  (Edinburgh, 1863); R. Kandt's _Caput Nili_ (Berlin, 1904); and map by\r\n  P. Sprigade and M. Moisel in _Grosser deutscher Kolonialatlas_, No. 16\r\n  (Berlin, 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAHLUR, or BILASPUR, a native state of India, within the Punjab. It is\r\none of the hill states that came under British protection after the\r\nfirst Sikh war in 1846. The Gurkhas had overrun the country in the early\r\npart of the 19th century, and expelled the raja, who was, however,\r\nreinstated by the British in 1815. The state occupies part of the basin\r\nof the Sutlej amid the lower slopes of the Himalaya. Area, 448 sq. m.\r\nPop. (1901), 90,873; estimated gross revenue, L10,000; tribute, L530.\r\nThe chief, whose title is raja, is a Chandel Rajput. The town of\r\nBilaspur is situated on the left bank of the Sutlej, 1465 ft. above\r\nsea-level; pop. (1901), 3192.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAHN, GUSTAVE (1859-   ), French poet, was born at Metz on the 21st of\r\nDecember 1859. He was educated in Paris at the Ecole des Chartes and the\r\nEcole des langues orientales, and began to contribute to obscure\r\nParisian reviews. After four years spent in Africa he returned to Paris\r\nin 1885, and founded in 1886 a weekly review, _La Vogue_, in which many\r\nof his early poems appeared. In the autumn of the same year he founded,\r\nwith Jean Moreas and Paul Adam, a short-lived periodical, _Le\r\nSymboliste_, in which they preached the nebulous poetic doctrine of\r\nStephane Mallarme; and in 1888 he became one of the editors of the\r\n_Revue independante_. He contributed poetry and criticism to the French\r\nand Belgian reviews favourable to the extreme symbolists, and, with\r\nCatulle Mendes, he founded at the Odeon, the Theatre Antoine and the\r\nTheatre Sarah Bernhardt, matinees for the production of the plays of the\r\nyounger poets. He claimed to be the earliest writer of the _vers libre_,\r\nand explained his methods and the history of the movement in a preface\r\nto his _Premiers poemes_ (1897). Later books are _Le Livre d'images_\r\n(1897); _Les Fleurs de la passion_ (1900); some novels; and a valuable\r\ncontribution to the history of modern French verse in _Symbolistes et\r\ndecadents_ (1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAHNIS, KARL FRIEDRICH AUGUST (1814-1888), German Lutheran theologian,\r\nwas born at Greiz on the 22nd of December 1814. He studied at Halle, and\r\nin 1850 was appointed professor ordinarius at Leipzig. Ten years later\r\nhe was made canon of Meissen. He retired in 1886, and died on the 20th\r\nof June 1888 at Leipzig. Kahnis was at first a neo-Lutheran, blessed by\r\nE. W. Hengstenberg and his pietistic friends. He then attached himself\r\nto the Old Lutheran party, interpreting Lutheranism in a broad and\r\nliberal spirit and showing some appreciation of rationalism. His\r\n_Lutherische Dogmatik, historisch-genetisch dargestellt_ (3 vols.,\r\n1861-1868; 2nd ed. in 2 vols., 1874-1875), by making concessions to\r\nmodern criticism, by spiritualizing and adapting the old dogmas, by\r\nattacking the idea of an infallible canon of Scripture and the\r\nconventional theory of inspiration, by laying stress on the human side\r\nof Scripture and insisting on the progressive character of revelation,\r\nbrought him into conflict with his former friends. A. W. Diekhoff, Franz\r\nDelitzsch (_Fur und wider Kahnis_, 1863) and Hengstenberg (_Evangelische\r\nKirchenzeitung_, 1862) protested loudly against the heresy, and Kahnis\r\nreplied to Hengstenberg in a vigorous pamphlet, _Zeugniss fur die\r\nGrundwahrheiten des Protestantismus gegen Dr Hengstenberg_ (1862).\r\n\r\n  Other works by Kahnis are _Lehre vom Abendmahl_ (1851), _Der innere\r\n  Gang des deutschen Protestantismus seit Mitte des vorigen\r\n  Jahrhunderts_ (1854; 3rd ed. in 2 vols., 1874; Eng. trans., 1856);\r\n  _Christentum und Luthertum_ (1871); _Geschichte der deutschen\r\n  Reformation_, vol. i. (1872); _Der Gang der Kirche in Lebensbildern_\r\n  (1881, &c.); and _Uber das Verhaltnis der alten Philosophie zum\r\n  Christentum_ (1884).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nK'AI-FENG FU, the capital of the province of Honan, China. It is\r\nsituated in 34 deg. 52' N., 114 deg. 33' E., on a branch line of the\r\nPeking-Hankow railway, and forms also the district city of Siang-fu. A\r\ncity on the present site was first built by Duke Chwang (774-700 B.C.)\r\nto mark off (_k'ai_) the boundary of his fief (_feng_); hence its name.\r\nIt has, however, passed under several _aliases_ in Chinese history.\r\nDuring the Chow, Suy and T'ang dynasties (557-907) it was known as\r\nP'ien-chow. During the Wu-tai, or five dynasties (907-960), it was the\r\nTung-king, or eastern capital. Under the Sung and Kin dynasties\r\n(960-1260) it was called P'ien-king. By the Yuan or Mongol dynasty\r\n(1260-1368) its name was again changed to P'ien-liang, and on the return\r\nof the Chinese to power with the establishment of the Ming dynasty\r\n(1368-1644), its original name was restored. The city is situated at the\r\npoint where the last spur of the Kuen-lun mountain system merges in the\r\neastern plain, and a few miles south of the Hwang-ho. Its position,\r\ntherefore, lays it Open to the destructive influences of this river. In\r\n1642 it was totally destroyed by a flood caused by the dikes bursting,\r\nand on several prior and subsequent occasions it has suffered injury\r\nfrom the same cause. The city is large and imposing, with broad streets\r\nand handsome buildings, the most notable of which are a twelve-storeyed\r\npagoda 600 ft. high, and a watch tower from which, at a height of 200\r\nft., the inhabitants are able to observe the approach of the yellow\r\nwaters of the river in times of flood. The city wall forms a substantial\r\nprotection and is pierced by five gates. The whole neighbourhood, which\r\nis the site of one of the earliest settlements of the Chinese in China,\r\nis full of historical associations, and it was in this city that the\r\nJews who entered China in A.D. 1163 first established a colony. For many\r\ncenturies these people held themselves aloof from the natives, and\r\npractised the rites of their religion in a temple built and supported by\r\nthemselves. At last, however, they fell upon evil times, and in 1851,\r\nout of the seventy families which constituted the original colony, only\r\nseven remained. For fifty years no rabbi had ministered to the wants of\r\nthis remnant. In 1853 the city was attacked by the T'ai-p'ing rebels,\r\nand, though at the first assault its defenders successfully resisted the\r\nenemy, it was subsequently taken. The captors looted and partially\r\ndestroyed the town. It has now little commerce, but contains several\r\nschools on Western lines--including a government college opened in 1902,\r\nand a military school near the railway station. A mint was established\r\nin 1905, and there is a district branch of the imperial post. The\r\npopulation--largely Mahommedan--was estimated (1908) at 200,000. Jews\r\nnumbered about 400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAILAS, a mountain in Tibet. It is the highest peak of the range of\r\nmountains lying to the north of Lake Manasorawar, with an altitude of\r\nover 22,000 ft. It is famous in Sanskrit literature as Siva's paradise,\r\nand is a favourite place of pilgrimage with Hindus, who regard it as the\r\nmost sacred spot on earth. A track encircles the base of the mountain,\r\nand it takes the pilgrim three weeks to complete the round, prostrating\r\nhimself all the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIN, the name of a sub-province and of a town of Khorasan, Persia. The\r\nsub-province extends about 300 m. N. to S., from Khaf to Seistan, and\r\nabout 150 m. W. to E., from the hills of Tun to the Afghan frontier,\r\ncomprising the whole of south-western Khorasan. It is very hilly, but\r\ncontains many wide plains and fertile villages at a mean elevation of\r\n4000 ft. It has a population of about 150,000, rears great numbers of\r\ncamels and produces much grain, saffron, wool, silk and opium. The chief\r\nmanufactures are felts and other woollen fabrics, principally carpets,\r\nwhich have a world-wide reputation. The best Kaini carpets are made at\r\nDarakhsh, a village in the Zirkuh district and 50 m. N.E. of Birjend. It\r\nis divided into eleven administrative divisions:--Shahabad (with the\r\ncapital Birjend), Naharjan, Alghur, Tabas sunni Khaneh, Zirkuh Shakhan,\r\nKain, Nimbuluk, Nehbandan, Khusf, Arab Khaneh or Momenabad.\r\n\r\nThe town of Kain, the capital of the sub-province until 1740, when it\r\nwas supplanted by Birjend, is situated 65 m. N. of Birjend on the\r\neastern side of a broad valley, stretching from N. to S., at the base of\r\nthe mountain Abuzar, in 33 deg. 42' N. and 59 deg. 8' E., and at an\r\nelevation of 4500 ft. Its population is barely 5000. It is surrounded by\r\na mud wall and bastions, and near it, on a hill rising 500 ft. above the\r\nplain, are the ruins of an ancient castle which, together with the old\r\ntown, was destroyed either by Shah Rukh (1404-1447), a son, or by\r\nBaysunkur (d. 1433), a grandson of Timur (Tamerlane), who afterwards\r\nbuilt a new town. After a time the Uzbegs took possession and held the\r\ntown until Shah Abbas I. (1587-1629) expelled them. In the 18th century\r\nit fell under the sway of the Afghans and remained a dependency of Herat\r\nuntil 1851. A large number of windmills are at work outside the town.\r\nThe great mosque, now in a ruinous state, was built A.H. 796 (A.D. 1394)\r\nby Karen b. Jamshid and repaired by Yusof Dowlatyar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIRA, or KHEDA, a town and district of British India, in the northern\r\ndivision of Bombay. The town is 20 m. S.W. of Ahmedabad and 7 m. from\r\nMehmadabad railway station. Pop. (1901), 10,392. Its antiquity is proved\r\nby the evidence of copperplate grants to have been known as early as the\r\n5th century. Early in the 18th century it passed to the Babi family,\r\nwith whom it remained till 1763, when it was taken by the Mahrattas; it\r\nwas finally handed over to the British in 1803. It was a large military\r\nstation till 1830, when the cantonment was removed to Deesa.\r\n\r\nThe DISTRICT OF KAIRA has an area of 1595 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 716,332,\r\nshowing a decrease of 18% in the decade, due to the results of famine.\r\nExcept a small corner of hilly ground near its northern boundary and in\r\nthe south-east and south, where the land along the Mahi is furrowed into\r\ndeep ravines, the district forms one unbroken plain, sloping gently\r\ntowards the south-west. The north and north-east portions are dotted\r\nwith patches of rich rice-land, broken by untilled tracts of low\r\nbrushwood. The centre of the district is very fertile and highly\r\ncultivated; the luxuriant fields are surrounded by high hedges, and the\r\nwhole country is clothed with clusters of shapely trees. To the west\r\nthis belt of rich vegetation passes into a bare though well-cultivated\r\ntract of rice-land, growing more barren and open till it reaches the\r\nmaritime belt, whitened by a salt-like crust, along the Gulf of Cambay.\r\nThe chief rivers are the Mahi on the south-east and south, and the\r\nSabarmati on the western boundary. The Mahi, owing to its deeply cut bed\r\nand sandbanks, is impracticable for either navigation or irrigation; but\r\nthe waters of the Sabarmati are largely utilized for the latter purpose.\r\nA smaller stream, the Khari, also waters a considerable area by means of\r\ncanals and sluices. The principal crops are cotton, millets, rice and\r\npulse; the industries are calico-printing, dyeing, and the manufacture\r\nof soap and glass. The chief centre of trade is Nadiad, on the railway,\r\nwith a cotton-mill. A special article of export is _ghi_, or clarified\r\nbutter. The Bombay & Baroda railway runs through the district. The\r\nfamine of 1899-1900 was felt more severely here than in any other part\r\nof the province, the loss of cattle being specially heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAIRAWAN (KEROUAN), the \"sacred\" city of Tunisia, 36 m. S. by W. by rail\r\nfrom Susa, and about 80 m. due S. from the capital. Kairawan is built in\r\nan open plain a little west of a stream which flows south to the\r\nSidi-el-Hani lake. Of the luxuriant gardens and olive groves mentioned\r\nin the early Arabic accounts of the place hardly a remnant is left.\r\nKairawan, in shape an irregular oblong, is surrounded by a crenellated\r\nbrick wall with towers and bastions and five gates. The city, however,\r\nspreads beyond the walls, chiefly to the south and west. Some of the\r\nfinest treasures of Saracenic art in Tunisia are in Kairawan; but the\r\ncity suffered greatly from the vulgarization which followed the Turkish\r\nconquest, and also from the blundering attempts of the French to restore\r\nbuildings falling into ruin. The streets have been paved and planted\r\nwith trees, but the town retains much of its Oriental aspect. The houses\r\nare built round a central courtyard, and present nothing but bare walls\r\nto the street. The chief buildings are the mosques, which are open to\r\nChristians, Kairawan being the only town in Tunisia where this privilege\r\nis granted.\r\n\r\nIn the northern quarter stands the great mosque founded by Sidi Okba ibn\r\nNafi, and containing his shrine and the tombs of many rulers of Tunisia.\r\nTo the outside it presents a heavy buttressed wall, with little of\r\neither grandeur or grace. It consists of three parts: a cloistered\r\ncourt, from which rises the massive and stately minaret, the maksura or\r\nmosque proper, and the vestibule. The maksura is a rectangular domed\r\nchamber divided by 296 marble and porphyry columns into 17 aisles, each\r\naisle having 8 arches. The central aisle is wider than the others, the\r\ncolumns being arranged by threes. All the columns are Roman or\r\nByzantine, and are the spoil of many ancient cities. Access to the\r\ncentral aisle is gained through a door of sculptured wood known as the\r\nBeautiful Gate. It has an inscription with the record of its\r\nconstruction. The walls are of painted plaster-work; the mimbar or\r\npulpit is of carved wood, each panel bearing a different design. The\r\ncourt is surrounded by a double arcade with coupled columns. In all the\r\nmosque contains 439 columns, including two of alabaster given by one of\r\nthe Byzantine emperors. To the Mahommedan mind the crowning distinction\r\nof the building is that through divine inspiration the founder was\r\nenabled to set it absolutely true to Mecca. The mosque of Sidi Okba is\r\nthe prototype of many other notable mosques (see MOSQUE). Of greater\r\nexternal beauty than that of Sidi Okba is the mosque of the Three Gates.\r\nCufic inscriptions on the facade record its erection in the 9th and its\r\nrestoration in the 15th century A.D. Internally the mosque is a single\r\nchamber supported by sixteen Roman columns. One of the finest specimens\r\nof Moorish architecture in Kairawan is the _zawia_ of Sidi\r\nAbid-el-Ghariani (d. c. A.D. 1400), one of the Almoravides, in whose\r\nfamily is the hereditary governorship of the city. The entrance, a door\r\nin a false arcade of black and white marble, leads into a court whose\r\narches support an upper colonnade. The town contains many other notable\r\nbuildings, but none of such importance as the mosque of the Companion\r\n(i.e. of the Prophet), outside the walls to the N.W. This mosque is\r\nspecially sacred as possessing what are said to be three hairs of the\r\nProphet's beard, buried with the saint, who was one of the companions\r\nof Mahomet. (This legend gave rise to the report that the tomb contained\r\nthe remains of Mahomet's barber.) The mosque consists of several courts\r\nand chambers, and contains some beautiful stained glass. The court which\r\nforms the entrance to the shrine of the saint is richly adorned with\r\ntiles and plaster-work, and is surrounded by an arcade of white marble\r\ncolumns, supporting a painted wooden roof. The minaret is faced with\r\ntiles and is surmounted by a gilded crescent. The 19th-century mosque of\r\nSidi Amar Abada, also outside the wall, is in the form of a cross and is\r\ncrowned with seven cupolas. In the suburbs are huge cisterns, attributed\r\nto the 9th century, which still supply the city with water. The cemetery\r\ncovers a large area and has thousands of Cufic and Arabic inscriptions.\r\n\r\nFormerly famous for its carpets and its oil of roses, Kairawan is now\r\nknown in northern Africa rather for copper vessels, articles in morocco\r\nleather, potash and saltpetre. The town has a population of about\r\n20,000, including a few hundred Europeans.\r\n\r\n  Arab historians relate the foundation of Kairawan by Okba with\r\n  miraculous circumstances (Tabari ii. 63; Yaqut iv. 213). The date is\r\n  variously given (see Weil, _Gesch. d. Chalifen_, i. 283 seq.);\r\n  according to Tabari it must have been before 670. The legend says that\r\n  Okba determined to found a city which should be a rallying-point for\r\n  the followers of Mahomet in Africa. He led his companions into the\r\n  desert, and having exhorted the serpents and wild beasts, in the name\r\n  of the Prophet, to retire, he struck his spear into the ground\r\n  exclaiming \"Here is your Kairawan\" (resting-place), so naming the\r\n  city.[1] In the 8th century Kairawan was the capital of the province\r\n  of Ifrikia governed by amirs appointed by the caliphs. Later it became\r\n  the capital of the Aghlabite princes, thereafter following the\r\n  fortunes of the successive rulers of the country (see TUNISIA:\r\n  _History_). After Mecca and Medina Kairawan is the most sacred city in\r\n  the eyes of the Mahommedans of Africa, and constant pilgrimages are\r\n  made to its shrines. Until the time of the French occupation no\r\n  Christian was allowed to pass through the gates without a special\r\n  permit from the bey, whilst Jews were altogether forbidden to approach\r\n  the holy city. Contrary to expectation no opposition was offered by\r\n  the citizens to the occupation of the place by the French troops in\r\n  1881. On that occasion the native troops hastened to the mosques to\r\n  perform their devotions; they were followed by European soldiers, and\r\n  the mosques having thus been \"violated\" have remained open ever since\r\n  to non-Mahommedans.\r\n\r\n  See Murray's _Handbook to Algeria and Tunis_, by Sir R. L. Playfair\r\n  (1895); A. M. Broadley, _The Last Punic War: Tunis Past and Present_\r\n  (1882) and H. Saladin, _Tunis el Kairouan_ (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Though Okba founded his city in a desert place, excavations\r\n    undertaken in 1908 revealed the existence of Roman ruins, including a\r\n    temple of Saturn, in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAISERSLAUTERN, a town in the Bavarian palatinate, on the Waldlauter, in\r\nthe hilly district of Westrich, 41 m. by rail W. of Mannheim. Pop.\r\n(1905), 52,306. Among its educational institutions are a gymnasium, a\r\nProtestant normal school, a commercial school and an industrial museum.\r\nThe house of correction occupies the site of Frederick Barbarossa's\r\ncastle, which was demolished by the French in 1713. Kaiserslautern is\r\none of the most important industrial towns in the palatinate. Its\r\nindustries include cotton and wool spinning and weaving, iron-founding,\r\nand the manufacture of beer, tobacco, gloves, boots, furniture, &c.\r\nThere is some trade in fruit and in timber.\r\n\r\nKaiserslautern takes its name from the emperor (Kaiser) Frederick I.,\r\nwho built a castle here about 1152, although it appears to have been a\r\nroyal residence in Carolingian times. It became an imperial city, a\r\ndignity which it retained until 1357, when it passed to the palatinate.\r\nIn 1621 it was taken by the Spanish, in 1631 by the Swedish, in 1635 by\r\nthe imperial and in 1713 by the French troops. During 1793 and 1794 it\r\nwas the scene of fighting; and in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 it was\r\nthe base of operations of the second German army, under Prince Frederick\r\nCharles. It was one of the early stations of the Reformation, and in\r\n1849 was the centre of the revolutionary spirit in the palatinate.\r\n\r\n  See Lehmann, _Urkundliche Geschichte von Kaiserslautern_\r\n  (Kaiserslautern, 1853), and E. Jost, _Geschichte der Stadt\r\n  Kaiserslautern_ (Kaiserslautern, 1886).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAISERSWERTH, a town in the Prussian Rhine province, on the right bank\r\nof the Rhine, 6 m. below Dusseldorf. Pop. (1905), 2462. It possesses a\r\nProtestant and a large old Romanesque Roman Catholic church of the 12th\r\nor 13th century, with a valuable shrine, said to contain the bones of St\r\nSuitbert, and has several benevolent institutions, of which the chief is\r\nthe _Diakonissen Anstalt_, or training-school for Protestant sisters of\r\ncharity. This institution, founded by Pastor Theodor Fliedner\r\n(1800-1864) in 1836, has more than 100 branches, some being in Asia and\r\nAmerica; the head establishment at Kaiserswerth includes an orphanage, a\r\nlunatic asylum and a Magdalen institution. The Roman Catholic hospital\r\noccupies the former Franciscan convent. The population is engaged in\r\nsilk-weaving and other small industries.\r\n\r\n  In 710 Pippin of Heristal presented the site of the town to Bishop\r\n  Suitbert, who built the Benedictine monastery round which the town\r\n  gradually formed. Until 1214 Kaiserswerth lay on an island, but in\r\n  that year Count Adolph V. of Berg, who was besieging it, dammed up\r\n  effectually one arm of the Rhine. About the beginning of the 14th\r\n  century Kaiserswerth, then an imperial city, came to the archbishopric\r\n  of Cologne, and afterwards to the duchy of Juliers, whence, after some\r\n  vicissitudes, it finally passed into the possession of the princes of\r\n  the palatinate, whose rights, long disputed by the elector of Cologne,\r\n  were legally settled in 1772. In 1702 the fortress was captured by the\r\n  Austrians and Prussians, and the Kaiserpfalz, whence the young emperor\r\n  Henry IV. was abducted by Archbishop Anno of Cologne in 1062, was\r\n  blown up.\r\n\r\n  See J. Disselhoff, _Das Diaconissenmutterhaus zu Kaiserswerth_ (new\r\n  ed., 1903; Eng. trans., 1883).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAITHAL, or KYTHAL, an ancient town of British India in Karnal district,\r\nPunjab. Pop. (1901), 14,408. It is said to have been founded by the\r\nmythical hero Yudisthira, and is connected by tradition with the\r\nmonkey-god Hanuman. In 1767 it fell into the hands of the Sikh\r\nchieftain, Bhai Desu Singh, whose descendants, the bhais of Kaithal,\r\nranked among the most powerful Cis-Sutlej chiefs. Their territories\r\nlapsed to the British in 1843. There remain the fort of the bhais, and\r\nseveral Mahommedan tombs of the 13th century and later. There is some\r\ntrade in grain, sal-ammoniac, live stock and blankets; and cotton,\r\nsaltpetre, lac ornaments and toys are manufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAKAPO, the Maori name, signifying \"night parrot,\" and frequently\r\nadopted by English writers, of a bird, commonly called by the British in\r\nNew Zealand the \"ground-parrot\" or \"owl-parrot.\" The existence of this\r\nsingular form was first made known in 1843 by Ernst Dieffenbach\r\n(_Travels in N. Zealand_, ii. 194), from some of its tail-feathers\r\nobtained by him, and he suggested that it was one of the _Cuculidae_,\r\npossibly belonging to the genus _Centropus_, but he added that it was\r\nbecoming scarce, and that no example had been seen for many years. G. R.\r\nGray, noticing it in June 1845 (_Zool. Voy. \"Erebus\" and \"Terror,\"_ pt.\r\nix. p. 9), was able to say little more of it, but very soon afterwards a\r\nskin was received at the British Museum, of which, in the following\r\nSeptember, he published a figure (_Gen. Birds_, pt. xvii.), naming it\r\n_Strigops[1] habroptilus_, and rightly placing it among the parrots, but\r\nhe did not describe it technically for another eighteen months (_Proc.\r\nZool. Society_, 1847, p. 61). Many specimens have now been received in\r\nEurope, so that it is represented in most museums, and several examples\r\nhave reached England alive.\r\n\r\nIn habits the kakapo is almost wholly nocturnal,[2] hiding in holes\r\n(which in some instances it seems to make for itself) under the roots of\r\ntrees or rocks during the day time, and only issuing forth about sunset\r\nto seek its food, which is solely vegetable in kind, and consists of the\r\ntwigs, leaves, seeds and fruits of trees, grass and fern roots--some\r\nobservers say mosses also. It sometimes climbs trees, but generally\r\nremains on the ground, only using its comparatively short wings to\r\nbalance itself in running or to break its fall when it drops from a\r\ntree--though not always then--being apparently incapable of real flight.\r\nIt thus becomes an easy prey to the marauding creatures--cats, rats and\r\nso forth--which European colonists have, by accident or design, let\r\nloose in New Zealand. Sir G. Grey says it had been, within the memory of\r\nold people, abundant in every part of that country, but (writing in\r\n1854) was then found only in the unsettled districts.\r\n\r\nThe kakapo is about the size of a raven, of a green or brownish-green\r\ncolour, thickly freckled and irregularly barred with dark brown, and\r\ndashed here and there with longitudinal stripes of light yellow.\r\nExamples are subject to much variation in colour and shade, and in some\r\nthe lower parts are deeply tinged with yellow. Externally the most\r\nstriking feature of the bird is its head, armed with a powerful beak\r\nthat it well knows how to use, and its face clothed with hairs and\r\nelongated feathers that sufficiently resemble the physiognomy of an owl\r\nto justify the generic name bestowed upon it. Of its internal structure\r\nlittle has been described, and that not always correctly. Its furcula\r\nhas been said (_Proc. Zool. Society_, 1874, p. 594) to be \"lost,\"\r\nwhereas the clavicles, which in most birds unite to form that bone, are\r\npresent, though they do not meet, while in like manner the bird has been\r\ndeclared (_op. cit._, 1867, p. 624, note) to furnish among the\r\n_Carinatae_ \"the only apparent exception to the presence of a keel\" to\r\nthe sternum. The keel, however, is undoubtedly there, as remarked by\r\nBlanchard (_Ann. Nat. Sc., Zoologie_, 4th series, vol. xi. p. 83) and A.\r\nMilne Edwards (_Ois. Foss. de la France_, ii. 516), and, though much\r\nreduced in size, is nearly as much developed as in the Dodo and the\r\nOcydrome. The aborted condition of this process can hardly be regarded\r\nbut in connexion with the incapacity of the bird for flight, and may\r\nvery likely be the result of disuse. There can be scarcely any doubt as\r\nto the propriety of considering this genus the type of a separate family\r\nof _Psittaci_; but whether it stands alone or some other forms\r\n(_Pezoporus_ or _Geopsittacus_, for example, which in coloration and\r\nhabits present some curious analogies) should be placed with it, must\r\nawait future determination. In captivity the kakapo is said to show much\r\nintelligence, as well as an affectionate and playful disposition.\r\nUnfortunately it does not seem to share the longevity characteristic of\r\nmost parrots, and none that has been held in confinement appears to have\r\nlong survived, while many succumb speedily.\r\n\r\n  For further details see Gould's _Birds of Australia_ (ii. 247), and\r\n  _Handbook_ (ii. 539); Dr Finsch's _Die Papageien_ (i. 241), and Sir\r\n  Walter Buller's _Birds of New Zealand_ especially.     (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] This generic term was subsequently altered by Van der Hoeven,\r\n    rather pedantically, to _Stringops_, a spelling now generally\r\n    adopted.\r\n\r\n  [2] It has, however, been occasionally observed abroad by day; and,\r\n    in captivity, one example at least is said to have been as active by\r\n    day as by night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAKAR, a Pathan tribe on the Zhob valley frontier of Baluchistan. The\r\nKakars inhabit the back of the Suliman mountains between Quetta and the\r\nGomal river; they are a very ancient race, and it is probable that they\r\nwere in possession of these slopes long before the advent of Afghan or\r\nArab. They are divided into many distinct tribes who have no connexion\r\nbeyond the common name of Kakar. Not only is there no chief of the\r\nKakars, or general _jirgah_ (or council) of the whole tribe, but in most\r\ncases there are no recognized heads of the different clans. In 1901 they\r\nnumbered 105,444. During the second Afghan War the Kakars caused some\r\nannoyance on the British line of communications; and the Kakars\r\ninhabiting the Zhob valley were punished by the Zhob valley expedition\r\nof 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALA-AZAR, or Dum-Dum fever, a tropical disease, characterized by\r\nremittent fever, anaemia and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly)\r\nand often of the liver. It is due to a protozoon parasite (see PARASITIC\r\nDISEASES), discovered in 1900 by Leishman in the spleen, and is of a\r\nmalarial type. The treatment is similar to that for malaria. In Assam\r\ngood results have been obtained by segregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALABAGH, a town of British India in the Mianwali district of the\r\nPunjab. Pop. (1901), 5824. It is picturesquely situated at the foot of\r\nthe Salt range, on the right bank of the Indus, opposite the railway\r\nstation of Mari. The houses nestle against the side of a precipitous\r\nhill of solid rock-salt, piled in successive tiers, the roof of each\r\ntier forming the street which passes in front of the row immediately\r\nabove, and a cliff, also of pure rock-salt, towers above the town. The\r\nsupply of salt, which is worked from open quarries, is practically\r\ninexhaustible. Alum also occurs in the neighbouring hills, and forms a\r\nconsiderable item of local trade. Iron implements are manufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALACH, also known as DONSKAYA, a village of S.E. Russia, in the\r\nterritory of the Don Cossacks, and a river port on the Don, 31 m. N.E.\r\nof Nizhne-Chirskaya, in 43 deg. 30' E. and 48 deg. 43' N. Its permanent\r\npopulation, only about 1200, increases greatly in summer. It is the\r\nterminus of the railway (45 m.) which connects the Don with Tsaritsyn on\r\nthe Volga, and all the goods (especially fish, petroleum, cereals and\r\ntimber) brought from the Caspian Sea up the Volga and destined for\r\nmiddle Russia, or for export through the Sea of Azov, are unloaded at\r\nTsaritsyn and sent over to Kalach on the Don.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALAHANDI (formerly KAROND), a feudatory state of India, which was\r\ntransferred from the Central Provinces to the Orissa division of Bengal\r\nin 1905. A range of the Eastern Ghats runs from N.E. to S.W. through the\r\nstate, with open undulating country to the north. Area 3745 sq. m.; pop.\r\n(1901), 350,529; estimated revenue, L8000; tribute, L800. The\r\ninhabitants mostly belong to the aboriginal race of Khonds. A murderous\r\noutbreak against Hindu settlers called for armed intervention in 1882.\r\nThe chief, Raghu Kishor Deo, was murdered by a servant in 1897, and\r\nduring the minority of his son, Brij Mohan Deo, the state was placed in\r\ncharge of a British political agent. The capital is Bhawani Patna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALAHARI DESERT, a region of South Africa, lying mainly between 20 deg.\r\nand 28 deg. S. and 19 deg. and 24 deg. E., and covering fully 120,000\r\nsq. m. The greater part of this territory forms the western portion of\r\nthe (British) Bechuanaland protectorate, but it extends south into that\r\npart of Bechuanaland annexed to the Cape and west into German South-West\r\nAfrica. The Orange river marks its southern limit; westward it reaches\r\nto the foot of the Nama and Damara hills, eastward to the cultivable\r\nparts of Bechuanaland, northward and north-westward to the valley of the\r\nOkavango and the bed of Lake Ngami. The Kalahari, part of the immense\r\ninner table-land of South Africa, has an average elevation of over 3000\r\nft. with a general slope from east to west and a dip northward to Ngami.\r\nDescribed by Robert Moffat as \"the southern Sahara,\" the Kalahari\r\nresembles the great desert of North Africa in being generally arid and\r\nin being scored by the beds of dried-up rivers. It presents however many\r\npoints of difference from the Sahara. The surface soil is mainly red\r\nsand, but in places limestone overlies shale and conglomerates. The\r\nground is undulating and its appearance is comparable with that of the\r\nocean at times of heavy swell. The crests of the waves are represented\r\nby sand dunes, rising from 30 to 100 ft.; the troughs between the dunes\r\nvary greatly in breadth. On the eastern border long tongues of sand\r\nproject into the veld, while the veld in places penetrates far into the\r\ndesert. There are also, and especially along the river beds, extensive\r\nmud flats. After heavy rain these become pans or lakes, and water is\r\nthen also found in mud-bottomed pools along the beds of the rivers. The\r\nwater in the pans is often brackish, and in some cases thickly encrusted\r\nwith salt. Pans also occur in crater-like depressions where rock rises\r\nabove the desert sands. A tough, sun-bleached grass, growing knee-high\r\nin tufts at intervals of about 15 in., covers the dunes and gives the\r\ngeneral colour of the landscape. Considerable parts of the Kalahari,\r\nchiefly in the west and north, are however covered with dense scrub and\r\nthere are occasional patches of forest. Next to the lack of water the\r\nchief characteristics of the desert are the tuberous and herbaceous\r\nplants and the large numbers of big game found in it. Of the plants the\r\nmost remarkable is the water-melon, of which both the bitter and sweet\r\nvariety are found, and which supplies both man and beast with water. The\r\ngame includes the lion, leopard, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, buffalo,\r\nzebra, quagga, many kinds of antelope (among them the kudu and gnu),\r\nbaboon and ostrich. The elephant, giraffe and eland are also found. The\r\nhunting of these three last-named animals is prohibited, and for all\r\ngame there is a close time from the beginning of September to the end of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nThe climate is hot, dry and healthy, save in the neighbourhood of the\r\nlarge marshes in the north, where malarial fever is prevalent. In this\r\nregion the drainage is N.E. to the great Makarikari marsh and the\r\nBotletle, the river connecting the marsh with the Ngami system. In the\r\nsouth the drainage is towards the Orange. The Molopo and the Kuruman,\r\nwhich in their upper course in eastern Bechuanaland are perennial\r\nstreams, lose their water by evaporation and percolation on their way\r\nwestward through the Kalahari. The Molopo, a very imposing river on the\r\nmap, is dry in its lower stretches. The annual rainfall does not exceed\r\n10 in. It occurs in the summer months, September to March, and chiefly\r\nin thunderstorms. The country is suffering from progressive desiccation,\r\nbut there is good evidence of an abundant supply of water not far\r\nbeneath the surface. In the water-melon season a few white farmers\r\nliving on the edge of the desert send their herds thither to graze. Such\r\nfew spots as have been under cultivation by artificial irrigation yield\r\nexcellent returns to the farmer; but the chief commercial products of\r\nthe desert are the skins of animals.\r\n\r\n  The Kalahari is the home of wandering Bushmen (q.v.), who live\r\n  entirely by the chase, killing their prey with poisoned arrows, of\r\n  Ba-Kalahari, and along the western border of Hottentots, who are both\r\n  hunters and cattle-rearers. The Ba-Kalahari (men of the Kalahari), who\r\n  constitute the majority of the inhabitants, appear to belong to the\r\n  Batau tribe of the Bechuanas, now no longer having separate tribal\r\n  existence, and traditionally reported to be the oldest of the Bechuana\r\n  tribes. Their features are markedly negroid, though their skin is less\r\n  black than that of many negro peoples. They have thin legs and arms.\r\n  The Ba-Kalahari are said to have possessed enormous herds of large\r\n  horned cattle until deprived of them and driven into the desert by a\r\n  fresh migration of more powerful Bechuana tribes. Unlike the Bushmen,\r\n  and in spite of desert life, the Ba-Kalahari have a true passion for\r\n  agriculture and cattle-breeding. They carefully cultivate their\r\n  gardens, though in many cases all they can grow is a scanty supply of\r\n  melons and pumpkins, and they rear small herds of goats. They are also\r\n  clever hunters, and from the neighbouring Bechuana chiefs obtain\r\n  spears, knives, tobacco and dogs in exchange for the skins of the\r\n  animals they kill. In disposition they are peaceful to timidity, grave\r\n  and almost morose. Livingstone states that he never saw Ba-Kalahari\r\n  children at play. An ingenious method is employed to obtain water\r\n  where there is no open well or running stream. To one end of a reed\r\n  about 2 ft. long a bunch of grass is tied, and this end of the reed is\r\n  inserted in a hole dug at a spot where water is known to exist\r\n  underground, the wet sand being rammed down firmly round it. An\r\n  ostrich egg-shell, the usual water vessel, is placed on the ground\r\n  alongside the reed. The water-drawer, generally a woman, then sucks up\r\n  the water through the reed, dexterously squirting it into the adjacent\r\n  egg-shell. To aid her aim she places between her lips a straw, the\r\n  other end of which is inserted in the shell. The shells, when filled,\r\n  are buried, the object of the Ba-Kalahari being to preserve their\r\n  supplies from any sudden raid by Bushmen or other foe. Early\r\n  travellers stated that no amount of bullying or hunting in a\r\n  Ba-Kalahari village would result in a find of water; but that on\r\n  friendly relations being established the natives would bring a supply,\r\n  however arid the district. The British government has since sunk wells\r\n  in one or two districts. Though the Ba-Kalahari have no religion in\r\n  the strict sense of the word, they show traces of totemism, and as\r\n  Batau, i.e. \"men of the lion,\" revere rather than fear that beast.\r\n\r\n  The Kalahari was first crossed to Lake Ngami by David Livingstone,\r\n  accompanied by William C. Oswell, in 1849. In 1878-1879 a party of\r\n  Boers, with about three hundred wagons, trekked from the Transvaal\r\n  across the Kalahari to Ngami and thence to the hinterland of Angola.\r\n  Many of the party, men, women and children, perished of thirst during\r\n  the journey. Survivors stated that in all some 250 people and 9000\r\n  cattle died.\r\n\r\n  See BECHUANALAND. _Die Kalahari_, by Dr Siegfried Passarge (Berlin,\r\n  1904), is a valuable treatise on the geology, topography, hydrography,\r\n  climate and flora of the desert, with maps and bibliography. The\r\n  author spent two years (1896-1898) in the Kalahari. See also\r\n  _Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa_, &c., by David\r\n  Livingstone (London, 1857).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALAMATA (officially [Greek: Kalamai], from an ancient town near the\r\nsite), chief town of the modern Greek nomarchy of Messenia in the Morea,\r\nsituated on the left bank of the Nedon, about 1 m. from the sea. Pop.\r\n(1907), 13,123. There is a suburb on the right bank of the stream. On a\r\nhill behind the town are the ruins of a medieval castle, but no ancient\r\nGreek remains have been discovered, although some travellers have\r\nidentified the site with that of the classical Pharae or Pherae. It is\r\nthe seat of a court of justice and of an archbishop. During the middle\r\nages it was for a time a fief of the Villehardouins. In 1685 Kalamata\r\nwas captured by the Venetians; in 1770, and again in 1821, it was the\r\nrevolutionary headquarters in the Morea. In 1825 it was sacked by\r\nIbrahim Pasha. Kalamata is situated in a very fruitful district, of\r\nwhich it is the emporium. The harbour, though recently improved, offers\r\nlittle shelter to shipping. Vessels load and discharge by means of\r\nlighters, the outer harbour having a depth at entrance of 24 ft. and\r\ninside of 14 ft. The inner harbour has a depth of 15 ft. and is\r\nsheltered by a breakwater 1640 ft. in length; in the winter months the\r\nfishing craft take shelter in the haven of Armyro. The silk industry,\r\nformerly important, still employs about 300 women and girls in four\r\nspinning establishments. Olive oil and silk are the chief exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALAMAZOO, a city and the county-seat of Kalamazoo county, Michigan,\r\nU.S.A., on the W. bank of the Kalamazoo River, about 49 m. S. of Grand\r\nRapids and 144 m. W. of Detroit. Pop. (1900) 24,404, of whom 4710 were\r\nforeign-born; (1910 census) 39,437. It is served by the Michigan\r\nCentral, the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern, the Grand Rapids & Indiana,\r\nthe Kalamazoo, Lake Shore & Chicago, and the Chicago, Kalamazoo &\r\nSaginaw railways, and by interurban electric lines. The city has a\r\npublic library, and is the seat of Kalamazoo college (Baptist), which\r\ngrew out of the Kalamazoo literary institute (1833) and was chartered\r\nunder its present name in 1855; the Michigan female seminary\r\n(Presbyterian), established in 1866; the Western State normal school\r\n(1904); Nazareth Academy (1897), for girls; Barbour Hall (1899), a\r\nschool for boys; two private schools for the feeble-minded; and the\r\nMichigan asylum for the insane, opened in 1859. The surrounding country\r\nis famous for its celery, and the city is an important manufacturing\r\ncentre, ranking third among the cities of the state in the value of its\r\nfactory products in 1904. The value of the factory product in 1904 was\r\n$13,141,767, an increase of 82.9% since 1900. The waterworks and\r\nelectric-lighting plant are owned and operated by the municipality.\r\nKalamazoo was settled in 1829, was known as Bronson (in honour of Titus\r\nBronson, an early settler) until 1836, was incorporated as the village\r\nof Kalamazoo in 1838, and in 1884 became a city under a charter granted\r\nin the preceding year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALAPUYA, or CALLAPOOYA, a tribe and stock of North-American Indians,\r\nwhose former range was the valley of the Willamette River, Oregon. They\r\nnow number little more than a hundred, on a reservation on Grande Ronde\r\nreservation, Oregon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALAT, the capital of Baluchistan, situated in 29 deg. 2' N. and 66 deg.\r\n35' E., about 6780 ft. above sea-level, 88 m. from Quetta. The town\r\ngives its name also to a native state with an area, including Makran and\r\nKharan, of 71,593 m. and a population (1901) of 470,336. The word Kalat\r\nis derived from _kala_--a fortress; and Kalat is the most picturesque\r\nfortress in the Baluch highlands. It crowns a low hill, round the base\r\nof which clusters the closely built mass of flat-roofed mud houses which\r\nform the insignificant town. A _miri_ or citadel, having an imposing\r\nappearance, dominates the town, and contains within its walls the palace\r\nof the khan. It was in an upper room of this residence that Mehrab Khan,\r\nruler of Baluchistan, was killed during the storming of the town and\r\ncitadel by the British troops at the close of the first Afghan War in\r\n1839. In 1901 it had a population of only 2000. The valleys immediately\r\nsurrounding the fortress are well cultivated and thickly inhabited, in\r\nspite of their elevation and the extremes of temperature to which they\r\nare exposed. Recent surveys of Baluchistan have determined the position\r\nof Hozdar or Khozdar (27 deg. 48' N., 66 deg. 38' E.) to be about 50 m.\r\nS. of Kalat. Khozdar was the former capital of Baluchistan, and is as\r\ndirectly connected with the southern branches of the Mulla Pass as Kalat\r\nis with the northern, the Mulla being the ancient trade route to Gandava\r\n(Kandabe) and Sind. In spite of the rugged and barren nature of the\r\nmountain districts of the Kalat highlands, the main routes through them\r\n(concentrating on Khozdar rather than on Kalat) are comparatively easy.\r\nThe old \"Pathan vat,\" the trade highway between Kalat and Karachi by the\r\nHab valley, passes through Khozdar. From Khozdar another route strikes a\r\nlittle west of south to Wad, and then passes easily into Las Bela. This\r\nis the \"Kohan vat.\" A third route runs to Nal, and leads to the head of\r\nthe Kolwa valley (meeting with no great physical obstruction), and then\r\nstrikes into the open high road to Persia. Some of the valleys about\r\nKalat (Mastang, for instance) are wide and fertile, full of thriving\r\nvillages and strikingly picturesque; and in spite of the great\r\npreponderance of mountain wilderness (a wilderness which is, however, in\r\nmany parts well adapted for the pasturage of sheep) existing in the\r\nSarawan lowlands almost equally with the Jalawan highlands, it is not\r\ndifficult to understand the importance which the province of Kalat,\r\nanciently called Turan (or Tubaran), maintained in the eyes of medieval\r\nArab geographers (see BALUCHISTAN). New light has been thrown on the\r\nhistory of Kalat by the translation of an unpublished manuscript\r\nobtained at Tatta by Mr Tate, of the Indian Survey Department, who has\r\nadded thereto notes from the Tufhat-ul-Kiram, for the use of which he\r\nwas indebted to Khan Sahib Rasul Baksh, mukhtiardar of Tatta. According\r\nto these authorities, the family of the khans of Kalat is of Arabic\r\norigin, and not, as is usually stated, of Brahuic extraction. They\r\nbelong to the Ahmadzai branch of the Mirwari clan, which originally\r\nemigrated from Oman to the Kolwa valley of Mekran. The khan of Kalat,\r\nMir Mahmud Khan, who succeeded his father in 1893, is the leading\r\nchieftain in the Baluch Confederacy. The revenue of the khan is\r\nestimated at nearly L60,000, including subsidies from the British\r\ngovernment; and an accrued surplus of L240,000 has been invested in\r\nIndian securities.\r\n\r\n  See G. P. Tate, _Kalat_ (Calcutta, 1896); _Baluchistan District\r\n  Gazetteer_, vol. vi. (Bombay, 1907).     (T. H. H.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALAT-I-GHILZAI, a fort in Afghanistan. It is situated on an isolated\r\nrocky eminence 5543 ft. above sea-level and 200 ft. above the plain, on\r\nthe right bank of the river Tarnak, on the road between Kabul and\r\nKandahar, 87 m. from Kandahar and 229 m. from Kabul. It is celebrated\r\nfor its gallant defence by Captain Craigie and a sepoy garrison against\r\nthe Afghans in the first Afghan War of 1842. In memory of this feat of\r\narms, the 12th Pioneers still bear the name of \"The Kalat-i-Ghilzai\r\nRegiment,\" and carry a special colour with the motto \"Invicta.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALB, JOHANN (\"BARON DE KALB\") (1721-1780), German soldier in the\r\nAmerican War of Independence, was born in Huttendorf, near Bayreuth, on\r\nthe 29th of June 1721. He was of peasant parentage, and left home when\r\nhe was sixteen to become a butler; in 1743 he was a lieutenant in a\r\nGerman regiment in the French service, calling himself at this time Jean\r\nde Kalb. He served with the French in the War of the Austrian\r\nSuccession, becoming captain in 1747 and major in 1756; in the Seven\r\nYears' War he was in the corps of the comte de Broglie, rendering great\r\nassistance to the French after Rossbach (November 1757) and showing\r\ngreat bravery at Bergen (April 1759); and in 1763 he resigned his\r\ncommission. As secret agent, appointed by Choiseul, he visited America\r\nin 1768-1769 to inquire into the feeling of the colonists toward Great\r\nBritain. From his retirement at Milon la Chapelle, Kalb went to Metz for\r\ngarrison duty under de Broglie in 1775. Soon afterwards he received\r\npermission to volunteer in the army of the American colonies, in which\r\nthe rank of major-general was promised to him by Silas Deane. After many\r\ndelays he sailed with eleven other officers on the ship fitted out by\r\nLafayette and arrived at Philadelphia in July 1777. His commission from\r\nDeane was disallowed, but the Continental Congress granted him the rank\r\nof major-general (dating from the 15th of September 1777), and in\r\nOctober he joined the army, where his growing admiration for Washington\r\nsoon led him to view with disfavour de Broglie's scheme for putting a\r\nEuropean officer in chief command. Early in 1778, as second in command\r\nto Lafayette for the proposed expedition against Canada, he accompanied\r\nLafayette to Albany; but no adequate preparations had been made, and the\r\nexpedition was abandoned. In April 1780, he was sent from Morristown,\r\nNew Jersey, with his division of Maryland men, his Delaware regiment and\r\nthe 1st artillery, to relieve Charleston, but on arriving at Petersburg,\r\nVirginia, he learned that Charleston had already fallen. In his camp at\r\nBuffalo Ford and Deep River, General Horatio Gates joined him on the\r\n25th of July; and next day Gates led the army by the short and desolate\r\nroad directly towards Camden. On the 11th-13th of August, when Kalb\r\nadvised an immediate attack on Rawdon, Gates hesitated and then marched\r\nto a position on the Salisbury-Charlotte road which he had previously\r\nrefused to take. On the 14th Cornwallis had occupied Camden, and a\r\nbattle took place there on the 16th when, the other American troops\r\nhaving broken and fled, Kalb, unhorsed and fighting fiercely at the head\r\nof his right wing, was wounded eleven times. He was taken prisoner and\r\ndied on the 19th of August 1780 in Camden. Here in 1825 Lafayette laid\r\nthe corner-stone of a monument to him. In 1887 a statue of him by\r\nEphraim Keyser was dedicated in Annapolis, Maryland.\r\n\r\n  See Friedrich Kapp, _Leben des amerikanischen Generals Johann Kalb_\r\n  (Stuttgart, 1862; English version, privately printed, New York, 1870),\r\n  which is summarized in George W. Greene's _The German Element in the\r\n  War of American Independence_ (New York, 1876).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALCKREUTH (or KALKREUTH), FRIEDRICH ADOLF, COUNT VON (1737-1818),\r\nPrussian soldier, entered the regiment of Gardes du Corps in 1752, and\r\nin 1758 was adjutant or aide de camp to Frederick the Great's brother,\r\nPrince Henry, with whom he served throughout the later stages of the\r\nSeven Years' War. He won special distinction at the battle of Freiberg\r\n(Sept. 29, 1762), for which Frederick promoted him major. Personal\r\ndifferences with Prince Henry severed their connexion in 1766, and for\r\nmany years Kalckreuth lived in comparative retirement. But he made the\r\ncampaign of the War of the Bavarian Succession as a colonel, and on the\r\naccession of Frederick William II. was restored to favour. He greatly\r\ndistinguished himself as a major-general in the invasion of Holland in\r\n1787, and by 1792 had become count and lieutenant-general. Under\r\nBrunswick he took a conspicuous part in the campaign of Valmy in 1792,\r\nthe siege and capture of Mainz in 1793, and the battle of Kaiserslautern\r\nin 1794. In the campaigns against Napoleon in 1806 he played a marked\r\npart for good or evil, both at Auerstadt and in the miserable retreat of\r\nthe beaten Prussians. In 1807 he defended Danzig for 78 days against the\r\nFrench under Marshal Lefebvre, with far greater skill and energy than he\r\nhad shown in the previous year. He was promoted field marshal soon\r\nafterwards, and conducted many of the negotiations at Tilsit. He died as\r\ngovernor of Berlin in 1818.\r\n\r\n  The _Dictees du Feldmarechal Kalckreuth_ were published by his son\r\n  (Paris, 1844).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALCKREUTH, LEOPOLD, COUNT VON (1855-   ), German painter, a direct\r\ndescendant of the famous field-marshal (see above), was born at\r\nDusseldorf, received his first training at Weimar from his father, the\r\nlandscape painter Count Stanislaus von Kalckreuth (1820-1894), and\r\nsubsequently studied at the academies of Weimar and Munich. Although he\r\npainted some portraits remarkable for their power of expression, he\r\ndevoted himself principally to depicting with relentless realism the\r\nmonotonous life of the fishing folk on the sea-coast, and of the\r\npeasants in the fields. His palette is joyless, and almost melancholy,\r\nand in his technique he is strongly influenced by the impressionists. He\r\nwas one of the founders of the secessionist movement. From 1885 to 1890\r\nCount von Kalckreuth was professor at the Weimar art school. In 1890 he\r\nresigned his professorship and retired to his estate of Hockricht in\r\nSilesia, where he occupied himself in painting subjects drawn from the\r\nlife of the country-folk. In 1895 he became a professor at the art\r\nschool at Karlsruhe. The Munich Pinakothek has his \"Rainbow\" and the\r\nDresden Gallery his \"Old Age.\" Among his chief works are the \"Funeral at\r\nDachau,\" \"Homewards,\" \"Wedding Procession in the Carpathian Mountains,\"\r\n\"The Gleaners,\" \"Old Age,\" \"Before the Fish Auction,\" \"Summer,\" and\r\n\"Going to School.\"\r\n\r\n  See A. Ph. W. v. Kalckreuth, _Gesch. der Herren, Freiherren und Grafen\r\n  von Kalckreuth_ (Potsdam, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALEIDOSCOPE (from Gr. [Greek: kalos], beautiful, [Greek: eidos], form,\r\nand [Greek: skopein], to view). The article REFLECTION explains the\r\nsymmetrical arrangement of images formed by two mirrors inclined at an\r\nangle which is a sub-multiple of four right angles. This is the\r\nprinciple of the kaleidoscope, an optical toy which received its present\r\nform at the hands of Sir David Brewster about the year 1815, and which\r\nat once became exceedingly popular owing to the beauty and variety of\r\nthe images and the sudden and unexpected changes from one graceful form\r\nto another. A hundred years earlier R. Bradley had employed a similar\r\narrangement which seems to have passed into oblivion (_New Improvements\r\nof Planting and Gardening_, 1710). The instrument has been extensively\r\nused by designers. In its simplest form it consists of a tube about\r\ntwelve inches long containing two glass plates, extending along its\r\nwhole length and inclined at an angle of 60 deg. The eye-end of the tube\r\nis closed by a metal plate having a small hole at its centre near the\r\nintersection of the glass plates. The other end is closed by a plate of\r\nmuffed glass at the distance of distinct vision, and parallel to this is\r\nfixed a plate of clear glass. In the intervening space (the\r\n_object-box_) are contained a number of fragments of brilliantly\r\ncoloured glass, and as the tube is turned round its axis these fragments\r\nalter their positions and give rise to the various patterns. A third\r\nreflecting plate is sometimes employed, the cross-section of the three\r\nforming an equilateral triangle. Sir David Brewster modified his\r\napparatus by moving the object-box and closing the end of the tube by a\r\nlens of short focus which forms images of distant objects at the\r\ndistance of distinct vision. These images take the place of the coloured\r\nfragments of glass, and they are symmetrically multiplied by the\r\nmirrors. In the _polyangular kaleidoscope_ the angle between the mirrors\r\ncan be altered at pleasure. Such instruments are occasionally found in\r\nold collections of philosophical apparatus and they have been used in\r\norder to explain to students the formation of multiple images.\r\n     (C. J. J.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALERGIS, DIMITRI (DEMETRIOS) (1803-1867), Greek statesman, was a Cretan\r\nby birth, studied medicine at Paris and on the outbreak of the War of\r\nGreek Independence went to the Morea and joined the insurgents. He\r\nfought under Karaiskakis, was taken prisoner by the Turks before Athens\r\nand mulcted of an ear; later he acted as aide de camp to the French\r\nphilhellene Colonel Fabvier and to Count Capo d'Istria, president of\r\nGreece. In 1832 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. In 1843, as\r\ncommander of a cavalry division, he was the prime mover in the\r\ninsurrection which forced King Otto to dismiss his Bavarian ministers.\r\nHe was appointed military commandant of Athens and aide de camp to the\r\nking, but after the fall of the Mavrocordato ministry in 1845 was forced\r\nto go into exile, and spent several years in London, where he became an\r\nintimate of Prince Louis Napoleon. In 1848 he made an abortive descent\r\non the Greek coast, in the hope of revolutionizing the kingdom. He was\r\ncaptured, but soon released and, after a stay in the island of Zante,\r\nwent to Paris (1853). At the instance of the Western Powers he was\r\nrecalled on the outbreak of the Crimean War and appointed minister of\r\nwar in the reconstituted Mavrocordato cabinet (1854). He was, however,\r\ndisliked by King Otto and his consort, and in October 1855 was forced to\r\nresign. In 1861 he was appointed minister plenipotentiary in Paris, in\r\nwhich capacity he took an important part in the negotiations which\r\nfollowed the fall of the Bavarian dynasty and led to the accession of\r\nPrince George of Denmark to the Greek throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALEWALA, or KALEVALA, the name of the Finnish national epos. It takes\r\nits name from the three sons of Kalewa (or Finland), viz. the ancient\r\nWainamoinen, the inventor of the sacred harp Kantele; the cunning\r\nart-smith, Ilmarinen; and the gallant Lemminkainen, who is a sort of\r\nArctic Don Juan. The adventures of these three heroes are wound about a\r\nplot for securing in marriage the hand of the daughter of Louhi, a hero\r\nfrom Pohjola, a land of the cold north. Ilmarinen is set to construct a\r\nmagic mill, the Sanpo, which grinds out meal, salt and gold, and as this\r\nhas fallen into the hands of the folk of Pohjola, it is needful to\r\nrecover it. The poem actually opens, however, with a very poetical\r\ntheory of the origin of the world. The virgin daughter of the\r\natmosphere, Luonnotar, wanders for seven hundred years in space, until\r\nshe bethinks her to invoke Ukko, the northern Zeus, who sends his eagle\r\nto her; this bird makes its nest on the knees of Luonnotar and lays in\r\nit seven eggs. Oat of the substance of these eggs the visible world is\r\nmade. But it is empty and sterile until Wainamoinen descends upon it\r\nand woos the exquisite Aino. She disappears into space, and it is to\r\nrecover from his loss and to find another bride that Wainamoinen makes\r\nhis series of epical adventures in the dismal country of Pohjola.\r\nVarious episodes of great strangeness and beauty accompany the lengthy\r\nrecital of the struggle to acquire the magical Sanpo, which gives\r\nprosperity to whoever possesses it. In the midst of a battle the Sanpo\r\nis broken and falls into the sea, but one fragment floats on the waves,\r\nand, being stranded on the shores of Finland, secures eternal felicity\r\nfor that country. At the very close of the poem a virgin, Mariatta,\r\nbrings forth a king who drives Wainamoinen out of the country, and this\r\nis understood to refer to the ultimate conquest of Paganism by\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nThe _Kalewala_ was probably composed at various times and by various\r\nbards, but always in sympathy with the latent traditions of the Finnish\r\nrace, and with a mixture of symbolism and realism exactly accordant with\r\nthe instincts of that race. While in the other antique epics of the\r\nworld bloodshed takes a predominant place, the _Kalewala_ is\r\ncharacteristically gentle, lyrical and even domestic, dwelling at great\r\nlength on situations of moral beauty and romantic pathos. It is entirely\r\nconcerned with the folk-lore and the traditions of the primeval Finnish\r\nrace. The poem is written in eight-syllabled trochaic verse, and an idea\r\nof its style may be obtained from Longfellow's _Hiawatha_, which is a\r\npretty true imitation of the Finnish epic.\r\n\r\n  Until the 19th century the _Kalewala_ existed only in fragments in the\r\n  memories and on the lips of the peasants. A collection of a few of\r\n  these scattered songs was published in 1822 by Dr Zacharius Topelius,\r\n  but it was not until 1835 that anything like a complete and\r\n  systematically arranged collection was given to the world by Dr Elias\r\n  Lonnrot. For years Dr Lonnrot wandered from place to place in the most\r\n  remote districts, living with the peasantry, and taking down from\r\n  their lips all that they knew of their popular songs. Some of the most\r\n  valuable were discovered in the governments of Archangel and Olonetz.\r\n  After unwearied diligence Lonnrot was successful in collecting 12,000\r\n  lines. These he arranged as methodically as he could into thirty-two\r\n  runes or cantos, which he published exactly as he heard them sung or\r\n  chanted. Continuing his researches, Dr Lonnrot published in 1849 a new\r\n  edition of 22,793 verses in fifty runes. A still more complete text\r\n  was published by A. V. Forsman in 1887. The importance of this\r\n  indigenous epic was at once recognized in Europe, and translations\r\n  were made into Swedish, German and French. Several translations into\r\n  English exist, the fullest being that by J. M. Crawford in 1888. The\r\n  best foreign editions are those of Castren in Swedish (1844), Leouzon\r\n  le Duc in French (1845 and 1868), Schiefner in German (1852).\r\n       (E. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALGAN (CHANG-CHIA K'OW), a city of China, in the province of Chih-li,\r\nwith a population estimated at from 70,000 to 100,000. It lies in the\r\nline of the Great Wall, 122 m. by rail N.W. of Peking, commanding an\r\nimportant pass between China and Mongolia. Its position is stated as in\r\n40 deg. 50' N. and 114 deg. 54' E., and its height above the sea as 2810\r\nft. The valley amid the mountains in which it is situated is under\r\nexcellent cultivation, and thickly studded with villages. Kalgan\r\nconsists of a walled town or fortress and suburbs 3 m. long. The streets\r\nare wide, and excellent shops are abundant; but the ordinary houses have\r\nan unusual appearance, from the fact that they are mostly roofed with\r\nearth and become covered with green-sward. Large quantities of soda are\r\nmanufactured; and the town is the seat of a very extensive transit\r\ntrade. In October 1909 it was connected by railway with Peking. In early\r\nautumn long lines of camels come in from all quarters for the conveyance\r\nof the tea-chests from Kalgan to Kiakhta; and each caravan usually makes\r\nthree journeys in the winter. Some Russian merchants have permanent\r\nresidences and warehouses just outside the gate. On the way to Peking\r\nthe road passes over a beautiful bridge of seven arches, ornamented with\r\nmarble figures of animals. The name Kalgan is Mongolian, and means a\r\nbarrier or \"gate-beam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALGOORLIE, a mining town of Western Australia, 24 m. by rail E.N.E. of\r\nCoolgardie. Pop. (1901), 6652. It is a thriving town with an electric\r\ntramway service, and is the junction of four lines of railway. The\r\ngold-field, discovered in 1893, is very rich, supporting about 15,000\r\nminers. The town is supplied with water, like Coolgardie, from a source\r\nnear Perth 360 m. distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALI (black), or _Kali Ma_ (the Black Mother), in Hindu mythology, the\r\ngoddess of destruction and death, the wife of Siva. According to one\r\ntheory, Calcutta owes its name to her, being originally Kalighat,\r\n\"Kali's landing-place.\" Siva's consort has many names (e.g. Durga,\r\nBhawani, Parvati, &c.). Her idol is black, with four arms, and red palms\r\nto the hands. Her eyes are red, and her face and breasts are besmeared\r\nwith blood. Her hair is matted, and she has projecting fang-like teeth,\r\nbetween which protrudes a tongue dripping with blood. She wears a\r\nnecklace of skulls, her earrings are dead bodies, and she is girded with\r\nserpents. She stands on the body of Siva, to account for which attitude\r\nthere is an elaborate legend. She is more worshipped in Gondwana and the\r\nforest tracts to the east and south of it than in any other part of\r\nIndia. Formerly human sacrifice was the essential of her ritual. The\r\nvictim, always a male, was taken to her temple after sunset and\r\nimprisoned there. When morning came he was dead: the priests told the\r\npeople that Kali had sucked his blood in the night. At Dantewara in\r\nBastar there is a famous shrine of Kali under the name of Danteswari.\r\nHere many a human head has been presented on her altar. About 1830 it is\r\nsaid that upwards of twenty-five full-grown men were immolated at once\r\nby the raja. Cutting their flesh and burning portions of their body were\r\namong the acts of devotion of her worshippers. Kali is goddess of\r\nsmall-pox and cholera. The Thugs murdered their victims in her honour,\r\nand to her the sacred pickaxe, wherewith their graves were dug, was\r\nconsecrated.\r\n\r\nThe _Hook-swinging Festival_ (_Churruk_ or _Churuck Puja_), one of the\r\nmost notable celebrations in honour of the goddess Kali, has now been\r\nprohibited in British territory. Those who had vowed themselves to\r\nself-torture submitted to be swung in the air supported only by hooks\r\npassed through the muscles over the blade-bones. These hooks were hung\r\nfrom a long crossbeam, which see-sawed upon a huge upright pole. Hoisted\r\ninto the air by men pulling down the other end of the see-saw beam, the\r\nvictim was then whirled round in a circle. The torture usually lasted\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n  See A. A. Macdonell, _Vedic Mythology_ (Strassburg, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALIDASA, the most illustrious name among the writers of the second\r\nepoch of Sanskrit literature, which, as contrasted with the age of the\r\nVedic hymns, may be characterized as the period of artificial poetry.\r\nOwing to the absence of the historical sense in the Hindu race, it is\r\nimpossible to fix with chronological exactness the lifetime of either\r\nKalidasa or any other Sanskrit author. Native tradition places him in\r\nthe 1st century B.C.; but the evidence on which this belief rests is\r\nworthless. The works of the poet contain no allusions by which their\r\ndate can be directly determined; yet the extremely corrupt form of the\r\nPrakrit or popular dialects spoken by the women and the subordinate\r\ncharacters in his plays, as compared with the Prakrit in inscriptions of\r\nascertained age, led such authorities as Weber and Lassen to agree in\r\nfixing on the 3rd century A.D. as the approximate period to which the\r\nwritings of Kalidasa should be referred.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the \"nine gems\" at the court of King Vikramaditya or\r\nVikrama, at Ujjain, and the tendency is now to regard the latter as\r\nhaving flourished about A.D. 375; others, however, place him as late as\r\nthe 6th century. The richness of his creative fancy, his delicacy of\r\nsentiment, and his keen appreciation of the beauties of nature, combined\r\nwith remarkable powers of description, place Kalidasa in the first rank\r\nof Oriental poets. The effect, however, of his productions as a whole is\r\ngreatly marred by extreme artificiality of diction, which, though to a\r\nless extent than in other Hindu poets, not unfrequently takes the form\r\nof puerile conceits and plays on words. In this respect his writings\r\ncontrast very unfavourably with the more genuine poetry of the Vedas.\r\nThough a true poet, he is wanting in that artistic sense of proportion\r\nso characteristic of the Greek mind, which exactly adjusts the parts to\r\nthe whole, and combines form and matter into an inseparable poetic\r\nunity. Kalidasa's fame rests chiefly on his dramas, but he is also\r\ndistinguished as an epic and a lyric poet.\r\n\r\n  He wrote three plays, the plots of which all bear a general\r\n  resemblance, inasmuch as they consist of love intrigues, which, after\r\n  numerous and seemingly insurmountable impediments of a similar nature,\r\n  are ultimately brought to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\n  Of these, _Sakuntala_ is that which has always justly enjoyed the\r\n  greatest fame and popularity. The unqualified praise bestowed upon it\r\n  by Goethe sufficiently guarantees its poetic merit. There are two\r\n  recensions of the text in India, the Bengali and the Devanagari, the\r\n  latter being generally considered older and purer. _Sakuntala_ was\r\n  first translated into English by Sir William Jones (Calcutta, 1789),\r\n  who used the Bengali recension. It was soon after translated into\r\n  German by G. Forster (1791; new ed. Leipzig, 1879). An edition of the\r\n  Sanskrit original, with French translation, was published by A. L.\r\n  Chezy at Paris in 1830. This formed the basis of a translation by B.\r\n  Hirzel (Zurich, 1830); later trans. by L. Fritze (Chemnitz, 1876).\r\n  Other editions of the Bengali recension were published by Prema\r\n  Chandra (Calcutta, 1860) for the use of European students and by R.\r\n  Pischel (2nd ed., Kiel, 1886). The Devanagari recension was first\r\n  edited by O. Bohtlingk (Bonn, 1842), with a German translation. On\r\n  this were based the successive German translations of E. Meier\r\n  (Tubingen, 1851) and E. Lobedanz (8th ed., Leipzig, 1892). The same\r\n  recension has been edited by Dr C. Burkhard with a Sanskrit-Latin\r\n  vocabulary and short Prakrit grammar (Breslau, 1872), and by Professor\r\n  Monier Williams (Oxford, 2nd ed. 1876), who also translated the drama\r\n  (5th ed., 1887). There is another translation by P. N. Patankar\r\n  (Poona, 1888-   ). There are also a South Indian and a Cashmir\r\n  recension.\r\n\r\n  The _Vikramorvasi_, or _Urvasi won by Valour_, abounds with fine\r\n  lyrical passages, and is of all Indian dramas second only to\r\n  _Sakuntala_ in poetic beauty. It was edited by R. Lenz (Berlin, 1833)\r\n  and translated into German by C. G. A. Hofer (Berlin, 1837), by B.\r\n  Hirzel (1838), by E. Lobedanz (Leipzig, 1861) and F. Bollensen\r\n  (Petersburg, 1845). There is also an English edition by Monier\r\n  Williams, a metrical and prose version by Professor H. H. Wilson, and\r\n  a literal prose translation by Professor E. B. Cowell (1851). The\r\n  latest editions are by S. P. Pandit (Bombay, 1879) and K. B. Paranjpe\r\n  (ibid. 1898).\r\n\r\n  The third play, entitled _Malavikagnimitra_, has considerable poetical\r\n  and dramatic merit, but is confessedly inferior to the other two. It\r\n  possesses the advantage, however, that its hero Agnimitra and its\r\n  heroine Malavika are more ordinary and human characters than those of\r\n  the other plays. It is edited by O. F. Tullberg (Bonn, 1840), by\r\n  Shankar P. Pandit, with English notes (1869), and S. S. Ayyar (Poona,\r\n  1896); translated into German by A. Weber (1856), and into English by\r\n  C. H. Tawney (2nd ed., Calcutta, 1898).\r\n\r\n  Two epic poems are also attributed to Kalidasa. The longer of these is\r\n  entitled _Raghuvamsa_, the subject of which is the same as that of the\r\n  _Ramayana_, viz. the history of Rama, but beginning with a long\r\n  account of his ancestors, the ancient rulers of Ayodhya (ed. by A. F.\r\n  Stenzler, London, 1832; and with Eng. trans. and notes by Gopal\r\n  Raghunath Nandargikar, Poona, 1897; verse trans. by P. de Lacy\r\n  Johnstone, 1902). The other epic is the _Kumarasambhava_, the theme of\r\n  which is the birth of Kumara, otherwise called Karttikeya or Skanda,\r\n  god of war (ed. by Stenzler, London, 1838; K. M. Banerjea, 3rd ed.\r\n  Calcutta, 1872; Parvanikara and Parab, Bombay, 1893; and M. R. Kale\r\n  and S. R. Dharadhara, ibid. 1907; Eng. trans. by R. T. Griffith,\r\n  1879). Though containing many fine passages, it is tame as a whole.\r\n\r\n  His lyrical poems are the _Meghaduta_ and the _Ritusamhara_. The\r\n  _Meghaduta_, or the Cloud-Messenger, describes the complaint of an\r\n  exiled lover, and the message he sends to his wife by a cloud. It is\r\n  full of deep feeling, and abounds with fine descriptions of the\r\n  beauties of nature. It was edited with free English translation by H.\r\n  H. Wilson (Calcutta, 1813), and by J. Gildemeister (Bonn, 1841); a\r\n  German adaptation by M. Muller appeared at Konigsberg (1847), and one\r\n  by C. Schutz at Bielefeld (1859). It was edited by F. Johnson, with\r\n  vocabulary and Wilson's metrical translation (London, 1867); later\r\n  editions by K. P. Parab (Bombay, 1891) and K. B. Pathak (Poona, 1894).\r\n  The _Ritusamhara_, or Collection of the Seasons, is a short poem, of\r\n  less importance, on the six seasons of the year. There is an edition\r\n  by P. von Bohlen, with prose Latin and metrical German translation\r\n  (Leipzig, 1840); Eng. trans. by C. S. Sitaram Ayyar (Bombay, 1897).\r\n\r\n  Another poem, entitled the _Nalodaya_, or Rise of Nala, edited by F.\r\n  Benary (Berlin, 1830), W. Yates (Calcutta, 1844) and Vidyasagara\r\n  (Calcutta, 1873), is a treatment of the story of Nala and Damayanti,\r\n  but describes especially the restoration of Nala to prosperity and\r\n  power. It has been ascribed to the celebrated Kalidasa, but was\r\n  probably written by another poet of the same name. It is full of most\r\n  absurd verbal conceits and metrical extravagances.\r\n\r\n  So many poems, partly of a very different stamp, are attributed to\r\n  Kalidasa that it is scarcely possible to avoid the necessity of\r\n  assuming the existence of more authors than one of that name. It is by\r\n  no means improbable that there were three poets thus named; indeed\r\n  modern native astronomers are so convinced of the existence of a triad\r\n  of authors of this name that they apply the term Kalidasa to designate\r\n  the number three.\r\n\r\n  On Kalidasa generally, see A. A. Macdonell's _History of Sanskrit\r\n  Literature_ (1900), and on his date G. Huth, _Die Zeit des K._\r\n  (Berlin, 1890).     (A. A. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALIMPONG, a village of British India, in the Darjeeling district of\r\nBengal, 4000 ft. above sea-level; pop. (1901), 1069. It is a frontier\r\nmarket for the purchase of wool and mules from Tibet, and an important\r\nagricultural fair is held in November. In 1900 Kalimpong was chosen by\r\nthe Church of Scotland as the site of cottage homes, known as St\r\nAndrew's Colonial Homes, for the education and training of poor European\r\nand Eurasian children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALINGA, or CALINGA, one of the nine kingdoms of southern India in\r\nancient times. Its exact limits varied, but included the eastern Madras\r\ncoast from Pulicat to Chicacole, running inland from the Bay of Bengal\r\nto the Eastern Ghats. The name at one time had a wider and vaguer\r\nmeaning, comprehending Orissa, and possibly extending to the Ganges\r\nvalley. The Kalinga of Pliny certainly included Orissa, but latterly it\r\nseems to have been confined to the Telugu-speaking country; and in the\r\ntime of Hsuan Tsang (630 A.D.) it was distinguished on the south and\r\nwest from Andhra, and on the north from Odra or Orissa. Taranatha, the\r\nTibetan historian, speaks of Kalinga as one division of the country of\r\nTelinga. Hsuan Tsang speaks of Kalinga (\"Kie-ling-kia\") having its\r\ncapital at what has been identified with the site either of Rajahmundry\r\nor Coringa. Both these towns, as well as Singapur, Calingapatam and\r\nChicacole, share the honour of having been the chief cities of Kalinga\r\nat different periods; but inscriptions recently deciphered seem to prove\r\nthat the capital of the Ganga dynasty of Kalinga was at Mukhalingam in\r\nthe Ganjam district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALINJAR, a town and hill fort of British India in the Banda district of\r\nthe United Provinces. Pop. (1901), 3015. The fort stands on an isolated\r\nrock, the termination of the Vindhya range, at an elevation of 1203 ft.,\r\noverlooking the plains of Bundelkhand. Kalinjar is the most\r\ncharacteristic specimen of the hill-fortresses, originally hill-shrines,\r\nof central India. Its antiquity is proved by its mention in the\r\n_Mahabharata_. It was besieged by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1023, and here the\r\nAfghan emperor Sher Shah met his death in 1545, and Kalinjar played a\r\nprominent part in history down to the time of the Mutiny in 1857, when\r\nit was held by a small British garrison. Both the fort and the town,\r\nwhich stands at the foot of the hill, are of interest to the antiquary\r\non account of their remains of temples, sculptures, inscriptions and\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALIR [QALIR], ELEAZER, Hebrew liturgical poet, whose hymns (_piyyutim_)\r\nare found in profusion in the festival prayers of the German synagogal\r\nrite. The age in which he lived is unknown. Some (basing the view on\r\nSaadiah's _Sefer ha-galuy_) place him as early as the 6th century,\r\nothers regard him as belonging to the 10th century. Kalir's style is\r\npowerful but involved; he may be described as a Hebrew Browning.\r\n\r\n  Some beautiful renderings of Kalir's poems may be found in the volumes\r\n  of Davis & Adler's edition of the German Festival Prayers entitled\r\n  _Service of the Synagogue_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALISCH, ISIDOR (1816-1886), Jewish divine, was born at Krotoschin in\r\nPrussia on the 15th of November 1816, and was educated at Berlin,\r\nBreslau and Prague. In 1848 he came to London, but passed on in 1849 to\r\nAmerica, where he ministered as rabbi in Cleveland, Cincinnati,\r\nMilwaukee, Detroit and Newark, New Jersey. At Newark from 1875 he gave\r\nhimself entirely to literary work, and exercised a strong influence as\r\nleader of the radical and reforming Jewish party.\r\n\r\n  Among his works are _Wegweisen fur rationelle Forschungen in den\r\n  biblischen Schriften_ (1853); and translations of _Nathan der Weise_\r\n  (1869); _Sepher Jezirah_ (1877); and Munz's _History of Philosophy\r\n  among the Jews_ (1881). He also wrote a good deal of German and Hebrew\r\n  verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALISCH, MARCUS (or MAURICE) (1828-1885), Jewish scholar, was born in\r\nPomerania in 1828, and died in England 1885. He was one of the pioneers\r\nof the critical study of the Old Testament in England. At one time he\r\nwas secretary to the Chief Rabbi; in 1853 he became tutor in the\r\nRothschild family and enjoyed leisure to produce his commentaries and\r\nother works. The first instalment of his commentary on the Pentateuch\r\nwas _Exodus_ (1855); this was followed by _Genesis_ (1858) and\r\n_Leviticus_ in two parts (1867-1872). Kalisch wrote before the\r\npublication of Wellhausen's works, and anticipated him in some important\r\npoints. Besides these works, Kalisch published in 1877-1878 two volumes\r\nof Bible studies (on _Balaam_ and _Jonah_). He was also author of a once\r\npopular Hebrew grammar in two volumes (1862-1863). In 1880 he published\r\n_Path and Goal_, a brilliant discussion of human destiny. His\r\ncommentaries are of permanent value, not only because of the author's\r\noriginality, but also because of his erudition. No other works in\r\nEnglish contain such full citations of earlier literature.     (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALISPEL, or PEND D'OREILLE, a tribe of North-American Indians of\r\nSalishan stock. They formerly ranged the country around Pend d'Oreille\r\nLake, Washington. They number some 600, and are settled on a reservation\r\nin Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALISZ, a government of Russian Poland, having Prussia on the W., and\r\nthe governments of Warsaw and Piotrkow on the E. Its area is 4390 sq. m.\r\nIts surface is a lowland, sloping towards the west, and is drained by\r\nthe Prosna and the Warta and their tributaries, and also by the Bzura.\r\nIt was formerly covered with countless small lakes and thick forests;\r\nthe latter are now mostly destroyed, but many lakes and marshes exist\r\nstill. Pop. (1897), 844,358 of whom 427,978 were women, and 113,609\r\nlived in towns; estimated pop. (1906), 983,200. They are chiefly Poles.\r\nRoman Catholics number 83%; Jews and Protestants each amount to 7%.\r\nAgriculture is carried to perfection on a number of estates, as also\r\nlivestock breeding. The crops principally raised are rye, wheat, oats,\r\nbarley and potatoes. Various domestic trades, including the weaving of\r\nlinen and wool, are carried on in the villages. There are some\r\nfactories, producing chiefly cloth and cottons. The government is\r\ndivided into eight districts, the chief towns of which, with their\r\npopulations in 1897, are: Kalisz (21,680), Kolo (9400), Konin (8530),\r\nLeczyca (8863), Slupec (3758), Sieradz (7019), Turek (8141) and Wielun\r\n(7442).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALISZ, the chief town of the above government, situated in 51 deg. 46'\r\nN. and 18 deg. E., 147 m. by rail W.S.W. of Warsaw, on the banks of the\r\nProsna, which there forms the boundary of Prussia. Pop. (1871), 18,088;\r\n(1897), 21,680, of whom 37% were Jews. It is one of the oldest and\r\nfinest cities of Poland, is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, and\r\npossesses a castle, a teachers' institute and a large public park. The\r\nindustrial establishments comprise a brewery, and factories for ribbons,\r\ncloth and sugar, and tanneries.\r\n\r\n  Kalisz is identified with the _Calisia_ of Ptolemy, and its antiquity\r\n  is indicated by the abundance of coins and other objects of ancient\r\n  art which have been discovered on the site, as well as by the numerous\r\n  burial mounds existing in the vicinity. It was the scene of the\r\n  decisive victory of Augustus the Strong of Poland over the Swedes on\r\n  the 29th of October 1706, of several minor conflicts in 1813, and of\r\n  the friendly meeting of the Russian and Prussian troops in 1835, in\r\n  memory of which an iron obelisk was erected in the town by Nicholas I.\r\n  in 1841. The treaty of 1813 between Russia and Prussia was signed\r\n  here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALK, a town in the Prussian Rhine province, on the right bank of the\r\nRhine, 2 m. E. of Cologne. Pop. (1905), 25,478. Kalk is an important\r\njunction of railway lines connecting Cologne with places on the right\r\nbank of the river. It has various iron and chemical industries,\r\nbrickworks and breweries, and an electric tramway joins it with Cologne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALKAS, or KHALKAS, a Mongoloid people mainly concentrated in the\r\nnorthern steppes of Mongolia near their kinsmen, the Buriats. According\r\nto Sir H. Howorth they derive their name from the river Kalka, which\r\nruns into the Buir lake. Of all Mongolians they physically differ most\r\nfrom the true Mongol type (see MONGOLS). Their colour is a brown rather\r\nthan a yellow, and their eyes are open and not oblique. They have,\r\nhowever, the broad flat face, high cheekbones and lank black hair of\r\ntheir race. They number some 250,000, and their territory is divided\r\ninto the four khanates of Tushetu (Tushiyetu), Tsetien (Setzen),\r\nSai'noi'm (Sain Noyan) and Jesaktu (Jassaktu).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALKBRENNER, FRIEDRICH WILHELM (1784-1849), German pianist and composer,\r\nson of Christian Kalkbrenner (1755-1806), a Jewish musician of Cassel,\r\nwas educated at the Paris Conservatoire, and soon began to play in\r\npublic. From 1814 to 1823 he was well known as a brilliant performer and\r\na successful teacher in London, and then settled in Paris, dying at\r\nEnghien, near there, in 1849. He became a member of the Paris\r\npiano-manufacturing firm of Pleyel & Co., and made a fortune by his\r\nbusiness and his art combined. His numerous compositions are less\r\nremembered now than his instruction-book, with \"studies,\" which have had\r\nconsiderable vogue among pianists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALLAY, BENJAMIN VON (1839-1903), Austro-Hungarian statesman, was born\r\nat Budapest on the 22nd of December 1839. His family derived their name\r\nfrom their estates at Nagy Kallo, in Szabolcs, and claimed descent from\r\nthe Balogh Semjen tribe, which colonized the counties of Borsod,\r\nSzabolcs, and Szatmar, at the close of the 9th century, when the Magyars\r\nconquered Hungary. They played a prominent part in Hungarian history as\r\nearly as the reign of Koloman (1095-1114); and from King Matthias\r\nCorvinus (1458-1490) they received their estates at Mezo Tur, near\r\nKecskemet, granted to Michael Kallay for his heroic defence of Jajce in\r\nBosnia, and still held by his descendants. The father of Benjamin von\r\nKallay, a superior official of the Hungarian Government, died in 1845,\r\nand his widow, who survived until 1903, devoted herself to the education\r\nof her son. At an early age Kallay manifested a deep interest in\r\npolitics, and especially in the Eastern Question. He travelled in\r\nRussia, European Turkey and Asia Minor, gaining a thorough knowledge of\r\nGreek, Turkish and several Slavonic languages. He became as proficient\r\nin Servian as in his native tongue. In 1867 he entered the Hungarian\r\nDiet as Conservative deputy for Muhlbach (Szasy-Szebes); in 1869 he was\r\nappointed consul-general at Belgrade; and in 1872 he visited Bosnia for\r\nthe first time. His views on Balkan questions strongly influenced Count\r\nAndrassy, the Austro-Hungarian minister for foreign affairs. Leaving\r\nBelgrade in 1875, he resumed his seat in the Diet, and shortly\r\nafterwards founded the journal _Kelet Nepe_, or _Eastern Folk_, in which\r\nhe defended the vigorous policy of Andrassy. After the Russo-Turkish War\r\nof 1878 he went to Philippopolis as Austro-Hungarian envoy extraordinary\r\non the International Eastern Rumelian Commission. In 1879 he became\r\nsecond, and soon afterwards first, departmental chief at the foreign\r\noffice in Vienna. On the 4th of June 1882 he was appointed Imperial\r\nminister of finance and administrator of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the\r\ndistinction with which he filled this office, for a period of 21 years,\r\nis his chief title of fame (see BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA). Kallay was an\r\nhonorary member of the Budapest and Vienna academies of science, and\r\nattained some eminence as a writer. He translated J. S. Mill's _Liberty_\r\ninto Hungarian, adding an introductory critique; while his version of\r\n_Galatea_, a play by the Greek dramatist S. N. Basiliades (1843-1874),\r\nproved successful on the Hungarian stage. His monographs on Servian\r\nhistory (_Geschichte der Serben_) and on the Oriental ambition of Russia\r\n(_Die Orientpolitik Russlands_) were translated into German by J. H.\r\nSchwicker, and published at Leipzig in 1878. But, in his own opinion,\r\nhis masterpiece was an academic oration on the political and\r\ngeographical position of Hungary as a link between East and West. In\r\n1873 Kallay married the countess Vilma Bethlen, who bore him two\r\ndaughters and a son. His popularity in Bosnia was partly due to the tact\r\nand personal charm of his wife. He died on the 13th of July 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALMAR (CALMAR), a seaport of Sweden on the Baltic coast, chief town of\r\nthe district (_lan_) of Kalmar, 250 m. S.S.W. of Stockholm by rail. Pop.\r\n(1900), 12,715. It lies opposite the island of Oland, mainly on two\r\nsmall islands, but partly on the mainland, where there is a pleasant\r\npark. The streets are regular, and most of the houses are of wood. The\r\nprincipal public edifices, however, are constructed of limestone from\r\nOland, including the cathedral, built by Nicodemus Tessin and his son\r\nNicodemus in the second half of the 17th century. Kalmar, a town of\r\ngreat antiquity, was formerly strongly fortified, and there remains the\r\nisland-fortress of Kalmarnahus, dating partly from the 12th century, but\r\nmainly from the 16th and 17th. It contains the beautiful chamber of King\r\nEric XIV. (d. 1577), an historical museum, and in the courtyard a fine\r\nornate well-cover. This stronghold stood several sieges in the 14th,\r\n15th and 16th centuries, and the town gives name to the treaty (Kalmar\r\nUnion) by which Sweden, Norway and Denmark were united into one kingdom\r\nin 1397. Kalmar has an artificial harbour admitting vessels drawing 19\r\nft. There are a school of navigation, and tobacco and match factories,\r\nthe produce of which, together with timber and oats, is exported.\r\nShip-building is carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALMUCK, or KALMYK STEPPE, a territory or reservation belonging to the\r\nKalmuck or Kalmyk Tatars, in the Russian government of Astrakhan,\r\nbounded by the Volga on the N.E., the Manych on the S.W., the Caspian\r\nSea on the E., and the territory of the Don Cossacks on the N.W. Its\r\narea is 36,900 sq. m., to which has to be added a second reservation of\r\n3045 sq. m. on the left bank of the lower Volga. According to I. V.\r\nMushketov, the Kalmuck Steppe must be divided into two parts, western\r\nand eastern. The former, occupied by the Ergeni hills, is deeply\r\ntrenched by ravines and rises 300 and occasionally 630 ft. above the\r\nsea. It is built up of Tertiary deposits, belonging to the Sarmatian\r\ndivision of the Miocene period and covered with loess and black earth,\r\nand its escarpments represent the old shore-line of the Caspian. No\r\nCaspian deposits are found on or within the Ergeni hills. These hills\r\nexhibit the usual black earth flora, and they have a settled population.\r\nThe eastern part of the steppe is a plain, lying for the most part 30 to\r\n40 ft. below the level of the sea, and sloping gently towards the Volga.\r\nPost-Pliocene \"Aral-Caspian deposits,\" containing the usual fossils\r\n(_Hydrobia_, _Neritina_, eight species of _Cardium_, two of _Dreissena_,\r\nthree of _Adacna_ and _Lithoglyphus caspius_), attain thicknesses\r\nvarying from 105 ft. to 7 or 10 ft., and disappear in places. Lacustrine\r\nand fluviatile deposits occur intermingled with the above. Large areas\r\nof moving sands exist near Enotayevsk, where high dunes or _barkhans_\r\nhave been formed. A narrow tract of land along the coast of the Caspian,\r\nknown as the \"hillocks of Baer,\" is covered with hillocks elongated from\r\nwest to east, perpendicularly to the coast-line, the spaces between them\r\nbeing filled with water or overgrown with thickets of reed, _Salix_,\r\n_Ulmus campestris_, almond trees, &c. An archipelago of little islands\r\nis thus formed close to the shore by these mounds, which are backed on\r\nthe N. and N.W. by strings of salt lakes, partly desiccated. Small\r\nstreams originate in the Ergenis, but are lost as soon as they reach the\r\nlowlands, where water can only be obtained from wells. The scanty\r\nvegetation is a mixture of the flora of south-east Russia and that of\r\nthe deserts of central Asia. The steppe has an estimated population of\r\n130,000 persons, living in over 27,700 _kibitkas_, or felt tents. There\r\nare over 60 Buddhist monasteries. Part of the Kalmucks are settled\r\n(chiefly in the hilly parts), the remainder being nomads. They breed\r\nhorses, cattle and sheep, but suffer heavy losses from murrain. Some\r\nattempts at agriculture and tree-planting are being made. The breeding\r\nof livestock, fishing, and some domestic trades, chiefly carried on by\r\nthe women, are the principal sources of maintenance.\r\n\r\n  See I. V. Mushketov, _Geol. Researches in the Kalmyk Steppe in\r\n  1884-1885_ (St Petersburg, 1894, in Russian); Kostenkov's works\r\n  (1868-1870); and other works quoted in Semenov's _Geogr. Dict._ and\r\n  _Russ. Encycl. Dict._     (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALNOKY, GUSTAV SIEGMUND, COUNT (1832-1898), Austro-Hungarian statesman,\r\nwas born at Lettowitz, in Moravia, on the 29th of December 1832, of an\r\nold Transylvanian family which had held countly rank in Hungary from the\r\n17th century. After spending some years in a hussar regiment, in 1854 he\r\nentered the diplomatic service without giving up his connexion with the\r\narmy, in which he reached the rank of general in 1879. He was for the\r\nten years 1860 to 1870 secretary of embassy at London, and then, after\r\nserving at Rome and Copenhagen, was in 1880 appointed ambassador at St\r\nPetersburg. His success in Russia procured for him, on the death of\r\nBaron v. Haymerle in 1881, the appointment of minister of foreign\r\naffairs for Austria-Hungary, a post which he held for fourteen years.\r\nEssentially a diplomatist, he took little or no part in the vexed\r\ninternal affairs of the Dual Monarchy, and he came little before the\r\npublic except at the annual statement on foreign affairs before the\r\nDelegations. His management of the affairs of his department was,\r\nhowever, very successful; he confirmed and maintained the alliance with\r\nGermany, which had been formed by his predecessors, and co-operated with\r\nBismarck in the arrangements by which Italy joined the alliance.\r\nKalnoky's special influence was seen in the improvement of Austrian\r\nrelations with Russia, following on the meeting of the three emperors in\r\nSeptember 1884 at Skiernevice, at which he was present. His Russophile\r\npolicy caused some adverse criticism in Hungary. His friendliness for\r\nRussia did not, however, prevent him from strengthening the position of\r\nAustria as against Russia in the Balkan Peninsula by the establishment\r\nof a closer political and commercial understanding with Servia and\r\nRumania. In 1885 he interfered after the battle of Slivnitza to arrest\r\nthe advance of the Bulgarians on Belgrade, but he lost influence in\r\nServia after the abdication of King Milan. Though he kept aloof from the\r\nClerical party, Kalnoky was a strong Catholic; and his sympathy for the\r\ndifficulties of the Church caused adverse comment in Italy, when, in\r\n1891, he stated in a speech before the Delegations that the question of\r\nthe position of the pope was still unsettled. He subsequently explained\r\nthat by this he did not refer to the Roman question, which was\r\npermanently settled, but to the possibility of the pope leaving Rome.\r\nThe jealousy felt in Hungary against the Ultramontanes led to his fall.\r\nIn 1895 a case of clerical interference in the internal affairs of\r\nHungary by the nuncio Agliardi aroused a strong protest in the Hungarian\r\nparliament, and consequent differences between Banffy, the Hungarian\r\nminister, and the minister for foreign affairs led to Kalnoky's\r\nresignation. He died on the 13th of February 1898 at Prodlitz in\r\nMoravia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALOCSA, a town of Hungary, in the county of Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kis-Kun, 88\r\nm. S. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900), 11,372. It is situated in a\r\nmarshy but highly productive district, near the left bank of the Danube,\r\nand was once of far greater importance than at present. Kalocsa is the\r\nsee of one of the four Roman Catholic archbishops in Hungary. Amongst\r\nits buildings are a fine cathedral, the archiepiscopal palace, an\r\nastronomical observatory, a seminary for priests, and colleges for\r\ntraining of male and female teachers. The inhabitants of Kalocsa and its\r\nwide-spreading communal lands are chiefly employed in the cultivation of\r\nthe vine, fruit, flax, hemp and cereals, in the capture of water-fowl\r\nand in fishing. Kalocsa is one of the oldest towns in Hungary. The\r\npresent archbishopric, founded about 1135, is a development of a\r\nbishopric said to have been founded in the year 1000 by King Stephen the\r\nSaint. It suffered much during the 16th century from the hordes of\r\nOttomans who then ravaged the country. A large part of the town was\r\ndestroyed by a fire in 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALPI, or CALPEE, a town of British India, in the Jalaun district of the\r\nUnited Provinces, on the right bank of the Jumna, 45 m. S.W. of\r\nCawnpore. Pop. (1901), 10,139. It was founded, according to tradition,\r\nby Vasudeva, at the end of the 4th century A.D. In 1196 it fell to\r\nKutab-ud-din, the viceroy of Mahommed Ghori, and during the subsequent\r\nMahommedan period it played a large part in the annals of this part of\r\nIndia. About the middle of the 18th century it passed into the hands of\r\nthe Mahrattas. It was captured by the British in 1803, and since 1806\r\nhas remained in British possession. In May 1858 Sir Hugh Rose (Lord\r\nStrathnairn) defeated here a force of about 10,000 rebels under the rani\r\nof Jhansi. Kalpi had a mint for copper coinage in the reign of Akbar;\r\nand the East India Company made it one of their principal stations for\r\nproviding the \"commercial investment.\" The old town, which is beside the\r\nriver, has ruins of a fort, and several temples of interest, while in\r\nthe neighbourhood are many ancient tombs. There is a lofty modern tower\r\nornamented with representations of the battles of the _Ramayana_. The\r\nnew town lies away from the river to the south-east. Kalpi is still a\r\ncentre of local trade (principally in grain, _ghi_ and cotton), with a\r\nstation on the Indian Midland railway from Jhansi to Cawnpore, which\r\nhere crosses the Jumna. There are manufactures of sugar and paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALUGA, a government of middle Russia, surrounded by those of Moscow,\r\nSmolensk, Orel and Tula, with an area of 11,942 sq. m. Its surface is an\r\nundulating plain, reaching 800 to 900 ft. in its highest parts, which\r\nlie in the S.W., and deeply trenched by watercourses, especially in the\r\nN.E. The Oka, a main tributary of the Volga, and its confluents (the\r\nZhizdra and Ugra) drain all but a strip of country in the west, which is\r\ntraversed by the Bolva, an affluent of the Dnieper. The government is\r\nbuilt up mainly of carboniferous deposits (coal-bearing), with patches\r\nof the soft Jurassic clays and limestones which formerly covered them.\r\nCretaceous deposits occur in the S.W., and Devonian limestones and\r\nshales crop out in the S.E. The government is covered with a thick layer\r\nof boulder clay in the north, with vast ridges and fields of boulders\r\nbrought during the Glacial Period from Finland and the government of\r\nOlonets; large areas in the middle are strewn with flint boulders and\r\npatches of loess are seen farther south. The mean annual temperature is\r\n41 deg. F. Iron ores are the chief mineral wealth, nearly 40,000 persons\r\nbeing engaged in mining. Beds of coal occur in several places, and some\r\nof them are worked. Fireclay, china-clay, chalk, grindstone, pure quartz\r\nsand, phosphorite and copper are also extracted. Forests cover 20% of\r\nthe surface, and occur chiefly in the south. The soil is not very\r\nsuitable for agriculture, and owing to a rather dense population,\r\nconsiderable numbers of the inhabitants find occupation in industry, or\r\nas carriers and carpenters for one-half of the year at the Black Sea\r\nports.\r\n\r\nThe population (1,025,705 in 1860) was 1,176,353 in 1897, nearly all\r\nGreat Russians. There were 116 women to 100 men, and out of the total\r\npopulation 94,853 lived in towns. The estimated population in 1906 was\r\n1,287,300. Of the total area over 4,000,000 acres are owned by the\r\npeasant communities, nearly 3,000,000 acres by private owners and some\r\n250,000 by the Crown. The principal crops are rye, oats, barley,\r\nbuckwheat, and potatoes. Hemp is grown for local use and export. Bees\r\nare kept. The chief non-agricultural industries are distilleries,\r\niron-works, factories for cloth, cottons, paper, matches, leather and\r\nchina, flour-mills and oil works. Large quantities of wooden wares are\r\nfabricated in the villages of the south. A considerable trade is carried\r\non in hemp, hempseed and hempseed oil, corn and hides; and iron,\r\nmachinery, leather, glass, chemicals and linen are exported. The\r\ngovernment is divided into 11 districts, the chief towns of which, with\r\ntheir populations in 1897, are: Kaluga (49,728), Borovsk (8407), Kozelsk\r\n(5908), Likhvin (1776), Maloyaroslavets (2500), Medyn (4392), Meshchovsk\r\n(3667), Mosalsk (2652), Peremyshl (3956), Tarusa (1989) and Zhizdra\r\n(5996).     (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALUGA, the chief town of the above government, situated on the left\r\nbank of the Oka, 117 m. S.W. of Moscow by rail, in 54 deg. 31' N. and 36\r\ndeg. 6' E. Pop. (1870), 36,880; (1897) 49,728. It is the see of a Greek\r\nOrthodox bishop. The public buildings include the cathedral of the\r\nTrinity (rebuilt in the 19th century in place of an older edifice dating\r\nfrom 1687), two monastic establishments, an ecclesiastical seminary, and\r\na lunatic asylum. The principal articles of industrial production are\r\nleather, oil, bast mats, wax candles, starch and Kaluga cakes. The first\r\nhistorical mention of Kaluga occurs in 1389; its incorporation with the\r\nprincipality of Moscow took place in 1518. In 1607 it was held by the\r\nsecond false Demetrius and vainly besieged for four months by the forces\r\nof Shuisky, who had ascended the Russian throne as Basil IV. on the\r\ndeath of the first false Demetrius. In 1619 Kaluga fell into the hands\r\nof the hetman or chief of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. Later two-thirds of\r\nits inhabitants were carried off by a plague; and in 1622 the whole\r\nplace was laid waste by a conflagration. It recovered, however, in spite\r\nof several other conflagrations (especially in 1742 and 1754). On\r\nseveral occasions Kaluga was the residence of political prisoners; among\r\nothers Shamyl, the Lesghian chief, spent his exile there (1859-1870).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKALYAN, a town of British India, in the Thana district of Bombay,\r\nsituated 33 m. N.E. of Bombay city, where the two main lines of the\r\nGreat Indian Peninsula railway diverge. Pop. (1901), 10,749. There is a\r\nconsiderable industry of rice-husking. Kalyan is known to have been the\r\ncapital of a kingdom and a centre of sea-borne commerce in the early\r\ncenturies of the Christian era. The oldest remains now existing are of\r\nMahommedan times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMA, or KAMADEVA, in Hindu mythology, the god of love. He is variously\r\nstated to have been the child of Brahma or Dharma (virtue). In the _Rig\r\nVeda_, Kama (desire) is described as the first movement that arose in\r\nthe One after it had come into life through the power of fervour or\r\nabstraction. In the Atharva-Veda Kama does not mean sexual desire, but\r\nrather the yearning after the good of all created things. Later Kama is\r\nsimply the Hindu Cupid. While attempting to lure Siva to sin, he was\r\ndestroyed by a fiery glance of the goddess' third eye. Thus in Hindu\r\npoetry Kama is known as Ananga, the \"bodiless god.\" Kama's wife Rati\r\n(voluptuousness) mourned him so greatly that Siva relented, and he was\r\nreborn as the child of Krishna and Rukmini. The babe was called\r\nPradyumna (Cupid). He is represented armed with a bow of sugar-cane; it\r\nis strung with bees, and its five arrows are tipped with flowers which\r\novercome the five senses. A fish adorns his flag, and he rides a parrot\r\nor sparrow, emblematic of lubricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMALA, a red powder formerly used in medicine as an anthelmintic and\r\nemployed in India as a yellow dye. It is obtained from _Mallotus\r\nphilippinensis_, Mull., a small euphorbiaceous tree from 20 to 45 ft. in\r\nheight, distributed from southern Arabia in the west to north Australia\r\nand the Philippines in the east. In India kamala has several ancient\r\nSanskrit names, one of which, kapila, signifies dusky or tawny red.\r\nUnder the name of wars, kanbil, or qinbil, kamala appears to have been\r\nknown to the Arabian physicians as a remedy for tapeworm and skin\r\ndiseases as early as the 10th century, and indeed is mentioned by Paulus\r\nAegineta still earlier. The drug was formerly in the British\r\nPharmacopoeia, but is inferior to many other anthelmintics and is not\r\nnow employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMCHATKA, a peninsula of N.-E. Siberia, stretching from the land of the\r\nChukchis S.S.W. for 750 m., with a width of from 80 to 300 m. (51 deg.\r\nto 62 deg. N., and 156 deg. to 163 deg. E.), between the Sea of Okhotsk\r\nand Bering Sea. It forms part of the Russian Maritime Province. Area,\r\n104,260 sq. m.\r\n\r\nThe isthmus which connects the peninsula with the mainland is a flat\r\n_tundra_, sloping gently both ways. The mountain chain, which Ditmar\r\ncalls central, seems to be interrupted under 57 deg. N. by a deep\r\nindentation corresponding to the valley of the Tighil. There too the\r\nhydrographical network, as well as the south-west to north-east strike\r\nof the clay-slates and metamorphic schists on Ditmar's map, seem to\r\nindicate the existence of two chains running south-west to north-east,\r\nparallel to the volcanic chain of S.E. Kamchatka. Glaciers were not\r\nknown till the year 1899, when they were discovered on the Byelaya and\r\nUshkinskaya (15,400 ft.) mountains. Thick Tertiary deposits, probably\r\nMiocene, overlie the middle portions of the west coast. The southern\r\nparts of the central range are composed of granites, syenites,\r\nporphyries and crystalline slates, while in the north of Ichinskaya\r\nvolcano, which is the highest summit of the peninsula (16,920 ft.), the\r\nmountains consist chiefly of Tertiary sandstones and old volcanic rocks.\r\nCoal-bearing clays containing fresh-water molluscs and dicotyledonous\r\nplants, as also conglomerates, alternate with the sandstones in these\r\nTertiary deposits. Amber is found in them. Very extensive layers of\r\nmelaphyre and andesite, as also of conglomerates and volcanic tuffs,\r\ncover the middle portions of the peninsula. The south-eastern portion is\r\noccupied by a chain of volcanoes, running along the indented coast, from\r\nCape Lopatka to Cape Kronotskiy (54 deg. 25' N.), and separated from the\r\nrest of the peninsula by the valleys of the Bystraya (an affluent of the\r\nBolstraya, on the west coast) and Kamchatka rivers. Another chain of\r\nvolcanoes runs from Ichinskaya (which burst into activity several times\r\nin the 18th and 19th centuries) to Shiveluch, seemingly parallel to the\r\nabove but farther north. The two chains contain twelve active and\r\ntwenty-six extinct volcanoes, from 7000 to more than 15,000 ft. high.\r\nThe highest volcanoes are grouped under 56 deg. N., and the highest of\r\nthem, Kluchevskaya (16,990 ft.), is in a state of almost incessant\r\nactivity (notable outbreaks in 1729, 1737, 1841, 1853-1854, and\r\n1896-1897), a flow of its lava having reached to Kamchatka river in\r\n1853. The active Shiveluch (9900 ft.) is the last volcano of this chain.\r\nSeveral lakes and probably Avacha Bay are old craters. Copper, mercury,\r\nand iron ores, as also pure copper, ochre and sulphur, are found in the\r\npeninsula. The principal river is the Kamchatka (325 m. long), which\r\nflows first north-eastwards in a fertile longitudinal valley, and then,\r\nbending suddenly to the east, pierces the above-mentioned volcanic\r\nchain. The other rivers are the Tighil (135 m.) and the Bolstraya (120\r\nm.), both flowing into the Sea of Okhotsk; and the Avacha, flowing into\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe floating ice which accumulates in the northern parts of the Sea of\r\nOkhotsk and the cold current which flows along the east coast of the\r\npeninsula render its summers chilly, but the winter is relatively warm,\r\nand temperatures below -40 deg. F. are experienced only in the highlands\r\nof the interior and on the Okhotsk littoral. The average temperatures at\r\nPetropavlovsk (53 deg. N.) are: year 37 deg. F., January 17 deg., July\r\n58 deg.; while in the valley of the Kamchatka the average temperature of\r\nthe winter is 16 deg., and of the summer as high as 58 deg. and 64 deg.\r\nRain and snow are copious, and dense fogs enshroud the coast in summer;\r\nconsequently the mountains are well clothed with timber and the meadows\r\nwith grass, except in the _tundras_ of the north. The natives eat\r\nextensively the bulbs of the Martagon lily, and weave cloth out of the\r\nfibres of the Kamchatka nettle. _Delphinopterus leucus_, the sea-lion\r\n(_Otaria Stelleri_), and walrus abound off the coasts. The sea-otter\r\n(_Enhydris marina_) has been destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe population (5846 in 1870) was 7270 in 1900. The southern part of the\r\npeninsula is occupied by Kamchadales, who exhibit many attributes of the\r\nMongolian race, but are more similar to the aborigines of N.E. Asia and\r\nN.W. America. Fishing (quantities of salmon enter the rivers) and\r\nhunting are their chief occupations. Dog-sledges are principally used as\r\nmeans of communication. The efforts of the government to introduce\r\ncattle-breeding have failed. The Kamchadale language cannot be assigned\r\nto any known group; its vocabulary is extremely poor. The purity of the\r\ntongue is best preserved by the people of the Penzhinsk district on the\r\nW. coast. North of 57 deg. N. the peninsula is peopled with Koryaks,\r\nsettled and nomad, and Lamuts (Tunguses), who came from the W. coast of\r\nthe Sea of Okhotsk. The principal Russian settlements are:\r\nPetropavlovsk, on the E. coast, on Avacha Bay, with an excellent\r\nroadstead; Verkhne-Kamchatsk and Nizhne-Kamchatsk in the valley of the\r\nKamchatka river; Bolsheryetsk, on the Bolshaya; and Tighil, on the W.\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe Russians made their first settlements in Kamchatka in the end of the\r\n17th century; in 1696 Atlasov founded Verkhne-Kamchatsk, and in 1704\r\nRobelev founded Bolsheryetsk. In 1720 a survey of the peninsula was\r\nundertaken; in 1725-1730 it was visited by Bering's expedition; and in\r\n1733-1745 it was the scene of the labours of the Krasheninnikov and\r\nSteller expedition.\r\n\r\n  See G.

When the ice-sheet melts,\r\nthese features, formerly concealed by the glacier, are revealed. They\r\nare common in the glaciated portions of the lower Scottish valleys. By\r\nsome authorities the term \"kame,\" or specifically \"serpentine kame,\" is\r\ntaken as synonymous with \"esker,\" which however is preferably to be\r\napplied to the long mound deposited within the ice-tunnel, not to the\r\nbunched mound at its mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMENETS PODOLSKIY, or PODOLIAN KAMENETS (Polish Kamieniec), a town of\r\nS.W. Russia, chief town of the government of Podolia. It stands in 48\r\ndeg. 40' N. and 26 deg. 30' E., on a high, rocky bluff of the river\r\nSmotrich, a left-hand tributary of the Dniester, and near the Austrian\r\nfrontier. Pop. (1863), 20,699; (1900) 39,113, of whom 50% were Jews and\r\n30% Poles. Round the town lies a cluster of suburban villages, Polish\r\nFolwark, Russian Folwark, Zinkovtsui, Karvasarui, &c.; and on the\r\nopposite side of the river, accessible by a wooden bridge, stands the\r\ncastle which long frowned defiance across the Dniester to Khotin in\r\nBessarabia. Kamenets is the see of a Roman Catholic and a Greek Orthodox\r\nbishop. The Roman Catholic cathedral of St Peter and St Paul, built in\r\n1361, is distinguished by a minaret, recalling the time when it was used\r\nas a mosque by the Turks (1672-1699). The Greek cathedral of John the\r\nBaptist dates from the 16th century, but up to 1798 belonged to the\r\nBasilian monastery. Other buildings are the Orthodox Greek monastery of\r\nthe Trinity, and the Catholic Armenian church (founded in 1398),\r\npossessing a 14th-century missal and an image of the Virgin Mary that\r\nsaw the Mongol invasion of 1239-1242. The town contains Orthodox Greek\r\nand Roman Catholic seminaries, Jewish colleges, and an archaeological\r\nmuseum for church antiquities, founded in 1890. Kamenets was laid waste\r\nby the Mongol leader Batu in 1240. In 1434 it was made the chief town of\r\nthe province of Podolia. In the 15th and 16th centuries it suffered\r\nfrequently from the invasions of Tatars, Moldavians and Turks; and in\r\n1672 the hetman of the Cossacks, Doroshenko, assisted by Sultan Mahommed\r\nIV. of Turkey, made himself master of the place. Restored to Poland by\r\nthe peace of Karlowitz (1699), it passed with Podolia to Russia in 1795.\r\nHere the Turks were defeated by the Poles in 1633, and here twenty years\r\nlater peace was concluded between the same antagonists. The\r\nfortifications were demolished in 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMENZ, a town in the kingdom of Saxony, on the Black Elster, 21 m. N.E.\r\nof Dresden, on a branch line of railway from Bischofswerda. Pop. (1900),\r\n9726. It has four Evangelical churches, among them a Wendish one, and a\r\nhandsome new town-hall with a library. The hospital is dedicated to the\r\nmemory of Lessing, who was born here. A colossal bust of the poet was\r\nplaced opposite the Wendish church in 1863, and a monument was raised to\r\nhim on a neighbouring hill in 1864. The industries of Kamenz include\r\nwool-spinning, and the manufacture of cloth, glass, crockery and\r\nstoneware. Built about 1200, Kamenz, was known by the name Dreikretcham\r\nuntil the 16th century. In 1318 it passed to the mark of Brandenburg; in\r\n1319 to Bohemia; and in 1635, after suffering much in the Hussite and\r\nThirty Years' wars, it came into the possession of Saxony. In 1706 and\r\n1842 it was almost entirely consumed by fire.\r\n\r\nKAMENZ is also the name of a village in Prussia, not far from Breslau;\r\npop. 900. This is famous on account of its Cistercian monastery, founded\r\nin 1094. Of the house, which was closed in 1810, only a few buildings\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMES, HENRY HOME, LORD (1696-1782), Scottish lawyer and philosopher,\r\nson of George Home of Kames, in Berwickshire, where he was born in 1696.\r\nAfter receiving a somewhat imperfect education from a private tutor, he\r\nwas in 1712 indentured to a writer to the signet in Edinburgh, but an\r\naccidental introduction to Sir Hew Dalrymple, then president of the\r\ncourt of session, determined him to aspire to the position of advocate.\r\nHe accordingly set himself to studying various branches of literature,\r\nspecially metaphysics and moral philosophy. He was called to the bar in\r\nJanuary 1724, and, as he lacked those brilliant qualities which\r\nsometimes command immediate success, he employed his leisure in the\r\ncompilation of _Remarkable Decisions in the Court of Session from 1716\r\nto 1728_ (1728). This work having attracted attention, his power of\r\ningenious reasoning and mastery of law gradually gained him a leading\r\nposition at the bar. In 1752 he was appointed a judge in the court of\r\nsession under the title of Lord Kames, and in 1763 he was made one of\r\nthe lords of justiciary. In 1741 he married Agatha Drummond, through\r\nwhom in 1761 he succeeded to the estate of Blair Drummond, Perthshire.\r\nHe continued to discharge his judicial duties till within a few days of\r\nhis death at Edinburgh on the 27th of December 1782.\r\n\r\n  Lord Kames took a special interest in agricultural and commercial\r\n  affairs. In 1755 he was appointed a member of the board of trustees\r\n  for encouragement of the fisheries, arts and manufactures of Scotland,\r\n  and about the same time he was named one of the commissioners for the\r\n  management of the forfeited estates annexed to the Crown. On the\r\n  subject of agriculture he wrote _The Gentleman Farmer_ (1776). In 1765\r\n  he published a small pamphlet _On the Flax Husbandry of Scotland_;\r\n  and, besides availing himself of his extensive acquaintance with the\r\n  proprietors of Scotland to recommend the introduction of manufactures,\r\n  he took a prominent part in furthering the project of the Forth and\r\n  Clyde Canal. He was also one of the founders of the Physical and\r\n  Literary Society, afterwards the Royal Society of Edinburgh. It is,\r\n  however, as a writer on philosophy that Lord Kames is best known. In\r\n  1751 he published his _Essays on the Principles of Morality and\r\n  Natural Religion_ (Ger. trans., Leipzig, 1772), in which he\r\n  endeavoured to maintain the doctrine of innate ideas, but conceded to\r\n  man an apparent but only apparent freedom of the will. His statement\r\n  of the latter doctrine so aroused the alarm of certain clergymen of\r\n  the Church of Scotland that he found it necessary to withdraw what was\r\n  regarded as a serious error, and to attribute man's delusive sense of\r\n  freedom, not to an innate conviction implanted by God, but to the\r\n  influence of the passions. His other philosophical works are _An\r\n  Introduction to the Art of Thinking_ (1761), _Elements of Criticism_\r\n  (1762), _Sketches of the History of Man_ (1774).\r\n\r\n  See _Life of Lord Kames_, by A. F. Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee (2 vols.,\r\n  1807).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMMIN, or CAMMIN, a town in the Prussian province of Pomerania, 2(1/2)\r\nm. from the Baltic, on the Kamminsche Bodden, a lake connected with the\r\nsea by the Dievenow. Pop. (1905), 5923. Among its four Evangelical\r\nchurches, the cathedral and the church of St Mary are noteworthy.\r\nIron-founding and brewing are carried on in the town, which has also\r\nsome fishing and shipping. There is steamer communication with Stettin,\r\nabout 40 m. S.S.W. Kammin is of Wendish origin, and obtained municipal\r\nprivileges in 1274. From about 1200 till 1628 it was the seat of a\r\nbishopric, which at the latter date became a secular principality, being\r\nin 1648 incorporated with Brandenburg.\r\n\r\n  See Kuchen, _Geschichte der Stadt Kammin_ (Kammin, 1885).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMPEN, a town in the province of Overysel, Holland, on the left bank of\r\nthe Ysel, 3(1/2) m. above its mouth, and a terminal railway station 8 m.\r\nN.W. of Zwolle. It has regular steamboat communication with Zwolle,\r\nDeventer, Amsterdam, and Enkhuizen. Pop. (1900), 19,664. Kampen is\r\nsurrounded by beautiful gardens and promenades in the place of the old\r\ncity walls, and has a fine river front. The four turreted gateways\r\nfurnish excellent examples of 16th and 17th century architecture. Of the\r\nchurches the Bovenkerk (\"upper church\"), or church of St Nicholas, ranks\r\nwith the cathedral of Utrecht and the Janskerk at 's Hertogenbosch as\r\none of the three great medieval churches in Holland. It was begun in\r\n1369, and has double aisles, ambulatory and radiating chapels, and\r\ncontains some finely carved woodwork. The Roman Catholic Buitenkerk\r\n(\"outer church\") is also a fine building of the 14th century, with good\r\nmodern panelling. There are many other, though slighter, remains of the\r\nancient churches and monasteries of Kampen; but the most remarkable\r\nbuilding is the old town-hall, which is unsurpassed in Holland. It dates\r\nfrom the 14th century, but was partly restored after a fire in 1543. The\r\nexterior is adorned with niched statues and beautiful iron trellis work\r\nround the windows. The old council-chamber is wainscoted in black oak,\r\nand contains a remarkable sculptured chimney-piece (1545) and fine wood\r\ncarving. The town-hall contains the municipal library, collections of\r\ntapestry, portraits and antiquities, and valuable archives relating to\r\nthe town and province. Kampen is the seat of a Christian Reformed\r\ntheological school, a gymnasium, a higher burgher school, a municipal\r\nschool of design, and a large orphanage. There are few or no local\r\ntaxes, the municipal chest being filled by the revenues derived from the\r\nfertile delta-land, the Kampeneiland, which is always being built up at\r\nthe mouth of the Ysel. There is a considerable, trade in dairy produce;\r\nand there are shipyards, rope-walks, a tool factory, cigar factories,\r\npaper mills, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMPTEE, or KAMTHI, a town of British India, in the Nagpur district of\r\nthe Central Provinces, just below the confluence of the Kanhan with the\r\nrivers Pench and Kolar; 10 m. N.E. of Nagpur by rail. Pop. (1901),\r\n38,888, showing a continuous decrease since 1881. Kamptee was founded in\r\n1821, as a military cantonment in the neighbourhood of the native\r\ncapital of Nagpur, and became an important centre of trade. Since the\r\nopening of the railway, trade has largely been diverted to Nagpur, and\r\nthe garrison has recently been reduced. The town is well laid out with\r\nwide roads, gardens and tanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMRUP, a district of British India, in the Brahmaputra valley division\r\nof Eastern Bengal and Assam. The headquarters are at Gauhati. Area, 3858\r\nsq. m.; pop. (1901), 589,187, showing a decrease of 7% in the decade. In\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the Brahmaputra the land is low, and\r\nexposed to annual inundation. In this marshy tract reeds and canes\r\nflourish luxuriantly, and the only cultivation is that of rice. At a\r\ncomparatively short distance from the river banks the ground begins to\r\nrise in undulating knolls towards the mountains of Bhutan on the north,\r\nand towards the Khasi hills on the south. The hills south of the\r\nBrahmaputra in some parts reach the height of 800 ft. The Brahmaputra,\r\nwhich divides the district into two nearly equal portions, is navigable\r\nby river steamers throughout the year, and receives several tributaries\r\nnavigable by large native boats in the rainy season. The chief of these\r\nare the Manas, Chaul Khoya and Barnadi on the north, and the Kulsi and\r\nDibru on the south bank. There is a government forest preserve in the\r\ndistrict and also a plantation where seedlings of teak, _sal_, _sissu_,\r\n_sum_, and _nahor_ are reared, and experiments are being made with the\r\ncaoutchouc tree. The population is entirely rural, the only town with\r\nupwards of 5000 inhabitants being Gauhati (11,661). The temples of Hajo\r\nand Kamakhya attract many pilgrims from all quarters. The staple crop of\r\nthe district is rice, of which there are three crops. The indigenous\r\nmanufactures are confined to the weaving of silk and cotton cloths for\r\nhome use, and to the making of brass cups and plates. The cultivation\r\nand manufacture of tea by European capital is not very prosperous. The\r\nchief exports are rice, oil-seeds, timber and cotton; the imports are\r\nfine rice, salt, piece goods, sugar, betel-nuts, coco-nuts and hardware.\r\nA section of the Assam-Bengal railway starts from Gauhati, and a branch\r\nof the Eastern Bengal railway has recently been opened to the opposite\r\nbank of the river. A metalled road runs due south from Gauhati to\r\nShillong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAMYSHIN, a town of Russia, in the government of Saratov, 145 m. by\r\nriver S.S.W. of the city of Saratov, on the right bank of the Volga.\r\nPop. (1861), 8644; (1897), 15,934. Being the terminus of the railway to\r\nTambov, Moscow and the Baltic ports, it is an important port for the\r\nexport of cereals and salt from the Volga, and it imports timber and\r\nwooden wares. It is famous for its water-melons. Peter the Great built\r\nhere a fort, which was known at first as Dmitrievsk, but acquired its\r\npresent name in 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANAKA, a Polynesian word meaning \"man,\" used by Polynesians to describe\r\nthemselves. Its ethnical value, never great, has been entirely destroyed\r\nby its indiscriminate use by the French to describe all South Sea\r\nislanders, whether black or brown. The corrupt French form _canaque_ has\r\nbeen used by some English writers. The term came into prominence in\r\n1884-1885 in connexion with the scandals arising over the kidnapping of\r\nSouth Sea islanders for enforced labour on the sugar plantations of\r\nnorth Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANARA, or CANARA, the name of two adjoining districts of British India:\r\nNorth Kanara in the presidency of Bombay, South Kanara in that of\r\nMadras. Both are on the western coast.\r\n\r\nNORTH KANARA DISTRICT forms part of the southern division of Bombay. The\r\nadministrative headquarters are at Karwar, which is also the chief\r\nseaport. Area, 3945 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 454,490, showing an increase\r\nof 2% in the decade. The trade of the interior, which used to pass down\r\nto the seaports, has been largely diverted by the opening of the\r\nSouthern Mahratta railway. Along the coast rice is the chief crop, and\r\ncoco-nut palms are also important. In the upland there are valuable\r\ngardens of areca palms, cardamoms and pepper. Rice and timber are\r\nexported, and sandalwood-carving and salt manufacture are carried on.\r\nThe main feature in the physical geography of the district is the range\r\nof the Western Ghats, which, running from north to south, divides it\r\ninto two parts, a lowland or coast strip (Payanghat), and an upland\r\nplateau (Balaghat). The coast-line is only broken by the Karwar headland\r\nin the north, and by the estuaries of four rivers and the mouths of many\r\nsmaller streams, through which the salt water finds an entrance into\r\nnumerous lagoons winding several miles inland. The breadth of the\r\nlowlands varies from 5 to 15 miles. From this narrow belt rise a few\r\nsmooth, flat-topped hills, from 200 to 300 ft. high; and at places it is\r\ncrossed by lofty, rugged, densely wooded spurs, which, starting from the\r\nmain range, maintain almost to the coast a height of not less than 1000\r\nft. Among these hills lie well-tilled valleys of garden and rice land.\r\nThe plateau of the Balaghat is irregular, varying from 1500 to 2000 ft.\r\nin height. In some parts the country rises into well-wooded knolls, in\r\nothers it is studded by small, isolated, steep hills. Except on the\r\nbanks of streams and in the more open glades, the whole is one broad\r\nwaste of woodland and forest. The open spaces are dotted with hamlets or\r\nparcelled out into rice clearings. Of the rivers flowing eastward from\r\nthe watershed of the Sahyadri hills the only one of importance is the\r\nWardha or Varada, a tributary of the Tungabhadra. Of those that flow\r\nwestwards, the four principal ones, proceeding from north to south, are\r\nthe Kali, Gungawali, Tadri and Sharavati. The last of these forms the\r\nfamous Gersoppa Falls. Extensive forests clothe the hills, and are\r\nconserved under the rules of the forest department.\r\n\r\nSOUTH KANARA DISTRICT has its headquarters at Mangalore. Area, 4021 sq.\r\nm. Pop. (1901), 1,134,713, showing an increase of 7% in the decade. The\r\ndistrict is intersected by rivers, none of which exceeds 100 miles in\r\nlength. They all take their rise in the Western Ghats, and many are\r\nnavigable during the fair weather for from 15 to 25 miles from the\r\ncoast. The chief of these streams are the Netravati, Gurpur and\r\nChendragiri. Numerous groves of coco-nut palms extend along the coast,\r\nand green rice-fields are seen in every valley. The Western Ghats,\r\nrising to a height of 3000 to 6000 ft., fringe the eastern boundary.\r\nForest land of great extent and value exists, but most of it is private\r\nproperty. Jungle products (besides timber) consist of bamboo, cardamoms,\r\nwild arrowroot, gall-nuts, gamboge, catechu, fibrous bark, cinnamon,\r\ngums, resin, dyes, honey and beeswax. The forests formerly abounded in\r\ngame, which, however, is rapidly decreasing under incessant shooting.\r\nThe staple crop is rice. The chief articles of import are piece goods,\r\ncotton yarn, oils and salt. Tiles are manufactured in several places out\r\nof a fine potter's clay. The Azhikal-Mangalore line of the Madras\r\nrailway serves the district.\r\n\r\n  See _South Canara District Manual_ (2 vols., Madras, 1894-1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANARESE, a language of the Dravidian family, spoken by about ten\r\nmillions of people in southern India, chiefly in Mysore, Hyderabad, and\r\nthe adjoining districts of Madras and Bombay. It has an ancient\r\nliterature, written in an alphabet closely resembling that employed for\r\nTelugu. Since the 12th century the Kanarese-speaking people have largely\r\nadopted the Lingayat form of faith, which may be described as an\r\nanti-Brahmanical sect of Siva worshippers (see HINDUISM). Most of them\r\nare agriculturists, but they also engage actively in trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANARIS (or CANARIS), CONSTANTINE (1790-1877), Greek patriot, belonged\r\nto the class of coasting sailors who produced if not the most honest, at\r\nleast the bravest, and the most successful of the combatants in the\r\ncause of Greek independence. He belonged by birth to the little island\r\nof Psara, to the north-west of Chio. He first became prominent as the\r\neffective leader of the signal vengeance taken by the Greeks for the\r\nmassacre at Chio in April 1822 by the Turkish Capitan Pasha. The\r\ncommander of the force of fifty small vessels and eight fireships sent\r\nto assail the Turkish fleet was the navarch Miaoulis, but it was Kanaris\r\nwho executed the attack with the fireships on the flagship of the\r\nCapitan Pasha on the night of the 18th of June 1822. The Turks were\r\ncelebrating the feast of Bahram at the end of the Ramadan fast. Kanaris\r\nhad two small brigs fitted as fireships, and thirty-six men. He was\r\nallowed to come close to the Turkish flagship, and succeeded in\r\nattaching his fireships to her, setting them on fire, and escaping with\r\nhis party. The fire reached the powder and the flagship blew up, sending\r\nthe Capitan Pasha and 2000 Turks into the air. Kanaris was undoubtedly\r\naided by the almost incredible sloth and folly of his opponents, but he\r\nchose his time well, and the service of the fireships was always\r\nconsidered peculiarly dangerous. That Kanaris could carry out the\r\nventure with a volunteer party not belonging to a regularly disciplined\r\nservice, not only proved him to be a clever partisan fighter, but showed\r\nthat he was a leader of men. He repeated the feat at Tenedos in November\r\nof 1822, and was then considered to have disposed of nearly 4000 Turks\r\nin the two ventures. When his native island, Psara, was occupied by the\r\nTurks he continued to serve under the command of Miaoulis. He was no\r\nless distinguished in other attacks with fireships at Samos and Mytilene\r\nin 1824, which finally established an utter panic in the Turkish navy.\r\nHis efforts to destroy the ships of Mehemet Ali at Alexandria in 1825\r\nwere defeated by contrary winds. When the Greeks tried to organize a\r\nregular navy he was appointed captain of the frigate \"Hellas\" in 1826.\r\nIn politics he was a follower of Capo d'Istria. He helped to upset the\r\ngovernment of King Otho and to establish his successor, was prime\r\nminister in 1864-1865, came back from retirement to preside over the\r\nministry formed during the crisis of the Russo-Turkish war, and died in\r\noffice on the 15th of September 1877. Kanaris is described as of small\r\nstature, simple in appearance, somewhat shy and melancholy. He is justly\r\nremembered as the most blameless of the popular heroes of the War of\r\nIndependence. He was almost the only one among them whom Dundonald, with\r\nwhom he served in a successful attack on an Egyptian war-ship near\r\nAlexandria, exempts from the sweeping charges of cowardice he brings\r\nagainst the Greeks.     (D. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANAUJ, an ancient city of British India, in Farukhabad district, United\r\nProvinces, near the left bank of the Ganges. Pop. (1901), 18,552. Kanauj\r\nin early times formed the capital of a great Hindu kingdom. Its\r\nprosperity dates from a prehistoric period, and seems to have culminated\r\nabout the 6th century under Harsha. In 1019 it fell before Mahmud of\r\nGhazni, and again in 1194 before Mahommed Ghori. The existing ruins\r\nextend over the lands of five villages, occupying a semicircle fully 4\r\nm. in diameter. No Hindu buildings remain intact; but the great mosque,\r\nconstructed by Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur in 1406 out of Hindu temples, is\r\nstill called by Hindus \"Sita's Kitchen.\" Kanauj, which is traditionally\r\nsaid to be derived from _Kanyakubja_ (= the crooked maiden), has given\r\nits name to an important division of Brahmans in northern India.\r\nHinduism in Lower Bengal also dates its origin from a Brahman migration\r\nsouthwards from this city, about 800 or 900. Kanauj is now noted for the\r\ndistilling of scents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANDAHAR, the largest city in Afghanistan, situated in 31 deg. 37' N.\r\nlat. and 65 deg. 43' E. long., 3400 ft. above the sea. It is 370 m.\r\ndistant from Herat on the N.W., by Girishk and Farah--Girishk being 75\r\nm., and Farah 225 m. from Kandahar. From Kabul, on the N.E., it is\r\ndistant 315 m., by Kalat-i-Ghilzai and Ghazni--Kalat-i-Ghilzai being 85\r\nm., and Ghazni 225 m. from Kandahar. To the Peshin valley the distance\r\nis about 110 m., and from Peshin to India the three principal routes\r\nmeasure approximately as follows: by the Zhob valley to Dera Ismail\r\nKhan, 300 m.; by the Bori valley to Dera Ghazi Khan, 275 m.; by Quetta\r\nand the Bolan to Dadar, 125 m.; and by Chappar and Nari to Sibi, 120 m.\r\nThe Indian railway system extends to New Chaman, within some 80 m. of\r\nKandahar. Immediately round the city is a plain, highly cultivated and\r\nwell populated to the south and west; but on the north-west barren, and\r\nbounded by a double line of hills, rising to about 1000 ft. above its\r\ngeneral level, and breaking its dull monotony with irregular lines of\r\nscarped precipices, crowned with fantastic pinnacles and peaks. To the\r\nnorth-west these hills form the watershed between the valleys of the\r\nArghandab and the Tarnak, until they are lost in the mountain masses of\r\nthe Hazarajat--a wild region inhabited by tribes of Tatar origin, which\r\neffectually shuts off Kandahar from communication with the north. On the\r\nsouth-west they lose themselves in the sandy desert of Registan, which\r\nwraps itself round the plain of Kandahar, and forms another impassable\r\nbarrier. But there is a break in these hills--a gate, as it were, to the\r\ngreat high road between Herat and India; and it is this gate which the\r\nfortress of Kandahar so effectually guards, and to which it owes its\r\nstrategic importance. Other routes there are, open to trade, between\r\nHerat and northern India, either following the banks of the Hari Rud,\r\nor, more circuitously, through the valley of the Helmund to Kabul; or\r\nthe line of hills between the Arghandab and the Tarnak may be crossed\r\nclose to Kalat-i-Ghilzai; but of the two former it may be said that they\r\nare not ways open to the passage of Afghan armies owing to the\r\nhereditary hostility existing between the Aeimak and Hazara tribes and\r\nthe Afghans generally, while the latter is not beyond striking distance\r\nfrom Kandahar. The one great high road from Herat and the Persian\r\nfrontier to India is that which passes by Farah and crosses the Helmund\r\nat Girishk. Between Kandahar and India the road is comparatively open,\r\nand would be available for railway communication but for the jealous\r\nexclusiveness of the Afghans.\r\n\r\nTo the north-west, and parallel to the long ridges of the Tarnak\r\nwatershed, stretches the great road to Kabul, traversed by Nott in 1842,\r\nand by Stewart and subsequently by Roberts in 1880. Between this and the\r\ndirect route to Peshin is a road which leads through Maruf to the Kundar\r\nriver and the Guleri pass into the plains of Hindustan at Dera Ismail\r\nKhan. This is the most direct route to northern India, but it involves\r\nthe passage of some rough country, across the great watershed between\r\nthe basins of the Helmund and the Indus. But the best known road from\r\nKandahar to India is that which stretches across the series of open\r\nstony plains interspersed with rocky hills of irregular formation\r\nleading to the foot of the Kwaja Amran (Khojak) range, on the far side\r\nof which from Kandahar lies the valley of Peshin. The passage of the\r\nKwaja Amran involves a rise and fall of some 2300 ft., but the range has\r\nbeen tunnelled and a railway now connects the frontier post of New\r\nChaman with Quetta. Two lines of railway now connect Quetta with Sind,\r\nthe one known as the Harnai loop, the other as the Bolan or Mashkaf\r\nline. They meet at Sibi (see BALUCHISTAN). Several roads to India have\r\nbeen developed through Baluchistan, but they are all dominated from\r\nKandahar. Thus Kandahar becomes a sort of focus of all the direct routes\r\nconverging from the wide-stretching western frontier of India towards\r\nHerat and Persia, and the fortress of Kandahar gives protection on the\r\none hand to trade between Hindustan and Herat, and on the other it lends\r\nto Kabul security from invasion by way of Herat.\r\n\r\nKandahar is approximately a square-built city, surrounded by a wall of\r\nabout 3(3/4) m. circuit, and from 25 to 30 ft. high, with an average\r\nbreadth of 15 ft. Outside the wall is a ditch 10 ft. deep. The city and\r\nits defences are entirely mud-built. There are four main streets\r\ncrossing each other nearly at right angles, the central \"chouk\" being\r\ncovered with a dome. These streets are wide and bordered with trees, and\r\nare flanked by shops with open fronts and verandas. There are no\r\nbuildings of any great pretension in Kandahar, a few of the more wealthy\r\nHindus occupying the best houses. The tomb of Ahmad Shah is the only\r\nattempt at monumental architecture. This, with its rather handsome\r\ncupola, and the twelve minor tombs of Ahmad Shah's children grouped\r\naround, contains a few good specimens of fretwork and of inlaid\r\ninscriptions. The four streets of the city divide it into convenient\r\nquarters for the accommodation of its mixed population of Duranis,\r\nGhilzais, Parsiwans and Kakars, numbering in all some 30,000 souls. Of\r\nthese the greater proportion are the Parsiwans (chiefly Kizilbashes).\r\n\r\nIt is reckoned that there are 1600 shops and 182 mosques in the city.\r\nThe mullahs of these mosques are generally men of considerable power.\r\nThe walls of the city are pierced by the four principal gates of\r\n\"Kabul,\" \"Shikarpur,\" \"Herat\" and the \"Idgah,\" opposite the four main\r\nstreets, with two minor gates, called the Top Khana and the Bardurani\r\nrespectively, in the western half of the city. The Idgah gate passes\r\nthrough the citadel, which is a square-built enclosure with sides of\r\nabout 260 yds. in length. The flank defences of the main wall are\r\ninsufficient; indeed there is no pretence at scientific structure about\r\nany part of the defences; but the site of the city is well chosen for\r\ndefence, and the water supply (drawn by canals from the Arghandab or\r\nderived from wells) is good.\r\n\r\n  About 4 m. west of the present city, stretched along the slopes of a\r\n  rocky ridge, and extending into the plains at its foot, are the ruins\r\n  of the old city of Kandahar sacked and plundered by Nadir Shah in\r\n  1738. From the top of the ridge a small citadel overlooks the\r\n  half-buried ruins. On the north-east face of the hill forty steps, cut\r\n  out of solid limestone, lead upward to a small, dome-roofed recess,\r\n  which contains some interesting Persian inscriptions cut in relief on\r\n  the rock, recording particulars of the history of Kandahar, and\r\n  defining the vast extent of the kingdom of the emperor Baber. Popular\r\n  belief ascribes the foundation of the old city to Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n  Although Kandahar has long ceased to be the seat of government, it is\r\n  nevertheless by far the most important trade centre in Afghanistan,\r\n  and the revenues of the Kandahar province assist largely in supporting\r\n  the chief power at Kabul. There are no manufactures or industries of\r\n  any importance peculiar to Kandahar, but the long lines of bazaars\r\n  display goods from England, Russia, Hindustan, Persia and Turkestan,\r\n  embracing a trade area as large probably as that of any city in Asia.\r\n  The customs and town dues together amount to a sum equal to the land\r\n  revenue of the Kandahar province, which is of considerable extent,\r\n  stretching to Pul-i-Sangin, 10 m. south of Kalat-i-Ghilzai on the\r\n  Kabul side, to the Helmund on the west, and to the Hazara country on\r\n  the north. Although Farah has been governed from Kandahar since 1863,\r\n  its revenues are not reckoned as a part of those of the province. The\r\n  land revenue proper is assessed in grain, the salaries of government\r\n  officials, pay of soldiers, &c., being disbursed by \"barats\" or orders\r\n  for grain at rates fixed by government, usually about 20% above the\r\n  city market prices. The greater part of the English goods sold at\r\n  Herat are imported by Karachi and Kandahar--a fact which testifies to\r\n  the great insecurity of trade between Meshed and Herat. Some of the\r\n  items included as town dues are curious. For instance, the tariff on\r\n  animals exposed for sale includes a charge of 5% ad valorem on slave\r\n  girls, besides a charge of 1 rupee per head. The kidney fat of all\r\n  sheep and the skins of all goats slaughtered in the public yard are\r\n  perquisites of government, the former being used for the manufacture\r\n  of soap, which, with snuff, is a government monopoly. The imports\r\n  consist chiefly of English goods, indigo, cloth, boots, leather,\r\n  sugar, salt, iron and copper, from Hindustan, and of shawls, carpets,\r\n  \"barak\" (native woollen cloth), postins (coats made of skins), shoes,\r\n  silks, opium and carpets from Meshed, Herat and Turkestan. The exports\r\n  are wool, cotton, madder, cummin seed, asafoetida, fruit, silk and\r\n  horses. The system of coinage is also curious: 105 English rupees are\r\n  melted down, and the alloy extracted, leaving 100 rupees' worth of\r\n  silver; 295 more English rupees are then melted, and the molten metal\r\n  mixed with the 100 rupees silver; and out of this 808 Kandahari rupees\r\n  are coined. As the Kandahari rupee is worth about 8 annas (half an\r\n  English rupee) the government thus realizes a profit of 1%.\r\n  Government accounts are kept in \"Kham\" rupees, the \"Kham\" being worth\r\n  about five-sixths of a Kandahari rupee; in other words, it about\r\n  equals the franc, or the Persian \"kran.\"\r\n\r\n  Immediately to the south and west of Kandahar is a stretch of\r\n  well-irrigated and highly cultivated country, but the valley of the\r\n  Arghandab is the most fertile in the district, and, from the luxuriant\r\n  abundance of its orchards and vineyards, offers the most striking\r\n  scenes of landscape beauty. The pomegranate fields form a striking\r\n  feature in the valley--the pomegranates of Kandahar, with its \"sirdar\"\r\n  melons and grapes, being unequalled in quality by any in the East. The\r\n  vines are grown on artificial banks, probably for want of the\r\n  necessary wood to trellis them--the grapes being largely exported in a\r\n  semi-dried state. Fruit, indeed, besides being largely exported, forms\r\n  the chief staple of the food supply of the inhabitants throughout\r\n  Afghanistan. The art of irrigation is so well understood that the\r\n  water supply is at times exhausted, no river water being allowed to\r\n  run to waste. The plains about Kandahar are chiefly watered by canals\r\n  drawn from the Arghandab near Baba-wali, and conducted through the\r\n  same gap in the hills which admits the Herat road. The amount of\r\n  irrigation and the number of water channels form a considerable\r\n  impediment to the movements of troops, not only immediately about\r\n  Kandahar, but in all districts where the main rivers and streams are\r\n  bordered by green bands of cultivation. Irrigation by \"karez\" is also\r\n  largely resorted to. The karez is a system of underground channelling\r\n  which usually taps a sub-surface water supply at the foot of some of\r\n  the many rugged and apparently waterless hills which cover the face of\r\n  the country. The water is not brought to the surface, but is carried\r\n  over long distances by an underground channel or drain, which is\r\n  constructed by sinking shafts at intervals along the required course\r\n  and connecting the shafts by tunnelling. The general agricultural\r\n  products of the country are wheat, barley, pulse, fruit, madder,\r\n  asafoetida, lucerne, clover and tobacco.\r\n\r\n  Of the mineral resources of the Kandahar district not much is known,\r\n  but an abandoned gold mine exists about 2 m. north of the town. Some\r\n  general idea of the resources of the Kandahar district may be gathered\r\n  from the fact that it supplied the British troops with everything\r\n  except luxuries during the entire period of occupation in 1879-81; and\r\n  that, in spite of the great strain thrown on those resources by the\r\n  presence of the two armies of Ayub Khan and of General Roberts, and\r\n  after the total failure of the autumn crops and only a partial harvest\r\n  the previous spring, the army was fed without great difficulty until\r\n  the final evacuation, at one-third of the prices paid in Quetta for\r\n  supplies drawn from India.\r\n\r\n  _History._--Kandahar has a stormy history. Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni\r\n  took it in the 11th century from the Afghans who then held it. In the\r\n  beginning of the 13th century it was taken by Jenghiz Khan, and in the\r\n  14th by Timur. In 1507 it was captured by the emperor Baber, but\r\n  shortly afterwards it fell again into Afghan hands, to be retaken by\r\n  Baber in 1521. Baber's son, Humayun, agreed to cede Kandahar to\r\n  Persia, but failed to keep his word, and the Persians besieged the\r\n  place unsuccessfully. Thus it remained in the possession of the Moguls\r\n  till 1625, when it was taken by Shah Abbas. Aurangzeb tried to take it\r\n  in 1649 with 5000 men, but failed. Another attempt in 1652 was equally\r\n  unsuccessful. It remained in Persian possession till 1709, when it was\r\n  taken by the Afghans, but was retaken after a two years' siege by\r\n  Nadir Shah. Nadir Shah was assassinated in 1749, and immediately on\r\n  hearing the news of his death Ahmad Shah (Abdali) seized Nadir Shah's\r\n  treasure at Kandahar, and proclaimed himself king, with the consent,\r\n  not only of the Afghans, but, strange to say, of the Hazaras and\r\n  Baluchis as well. He at once changed the site of the city to its\r\n  present position, and thus founded the Afghan kingdom, with modern\r\n  Kandahar as its capital. Ahmad Shah died in 1773, and was succeeded by\r\n  his son Timur, who died in 1793, and left the throne to his son Zaman\r\n  Shah. This prince was deposed by his half-brother Mahmud, who was in\r\n  his turn deposed by Shah Shuja, the full brother of Zaman Shah. After\r\n  a short reign Shah Shuja was compelled to abdicate from his inability\r\n  to repress the rising power of Fateh Khan, a Barakzai chief, and he\r\n  took refuge first with Ranjit Singh, who then ruled the Punjab, and\r\n  finally secured the protection of British power. Afghanistan was now\r\n  practically dismembered. Mahmud was reinstated by Fateh Khan, whom he\r\n  appointed his vizier, and whose nephews, Dost Mahommed Khan and Kohn\r\n  dil Khan, he placed respectively in the governments of Kabul and\r\n  Kandahar. Fateh Khan was barbarously murdered by Kamran (Mahmud's son)\r\n  near Ghazni in 1818; and in retaliation Mahmud himself was driven from\r\n  power, and the Barakzai clan secured the sovereignty of Afghanistan.\r\n  While Dost Mahommed held Kabul, Kandahar became temporarily a sort of\r\n  independent chiefship under two or three of his brothers. In 1839 the\r\n  cause of Shah Shuja was actively supported by the British. Kandahar\r\n  was occupied, and Shah Shuja reinstated on the throne of his\r\n  ancestors. Dost Mahommed was defeated near Kabul, and after surrender\r\n  to the British force, was deported into Hindustan. The British army of\r\n  occupation in southern Afghanistan continued to occupy Kandahar from\r\n  1839 till the autumn of 1842, when General Nott marched on Kabul to\r\n  meet Pollock's advance from Jalalabad. The cantonments near the city,\r\n  built by Nott's division, were repaired and again occupied by the\r\n  British army in 1879, when Shere Ali was driven from power by the\r\n  invasion of Afghanistan, nor were they finally evacuated till the\r\n  spring of 1881. Trade statistics of late years show a gradual increase\r\n  of exports to India from Kandahar and the countries adjacent thereto,\r\n  but a curious falling-off in imports. The short-sighted policy of the\r\n  amir Abdur Rahman in discouraging imports doubtless affected the\r\n  balance, nor did his affectation of ignoring the railway between New\r\n  Chaman and Kila Abdulla (on the Peshin side of the Khojak) conduce to\r\n  the improvement of trade.     (T. H. H.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANDI, a town of British India, in Murshidabad district, Bengal. Pop.\r\n(1901), 12,037. It is the residence of the rajas of Paikpara, a wealthy\r\nand devout Hindu family. The founder of this family was Ganga Govind\r\nSingh, the banyan or agent of Warren Hastings, who was born at Kandi,\r\nand retired hither in his old age with an immense fortune. His name has\r\nacquired celebrity for the most magnificent _sraddha_, or funeral\r\nobsequies, ever performed in Bengal, celebrated in honour of his mother,\r\nat a cost, it is said, of L200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANDY, a town near the centre of Ceylon, 75 m. from Colombo by rail,\r\nformerly the capital of a kingdom of the same name, situated towards\r\nthe heart of the island, 1718 ft. above the sea. It lies round the\r\nmargin of an artificial lake constructed by the last king of Kandy in\r\n1806, and is beautifully surrounded by hills. The most striking objects\r\nare the temples (of which twelve are Buddhist and four Brahman), the\r\ntombs of the Kandian kings, and the various buildings of the royal\r\nresidence, partly allowed to fall into disrepair, partly utilized by the\r\ngovernment. Of the temples the Dalada Malagawa is worthy of particular\r\nmention; it claims, as the name indicates, to be in possession of a\r\nBuddha tooth.\r\n\r\nKandy was occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the\r\nDutch in 1763; but in both instances the native kings succeeded in\r\nshaking off the foreign yoke. The British got possession of the place in\r\n1803, but the garrison afterwards capitulated and were massacred, and it\r\nwas not till 1814-15 that the king was defeated and dethroned. The\r\nBritish authority was formally established by the convention of March 2,\r\n1815. In 1848, owing to an attempt at rebellion, the town was for a time\r\nunder martial law. It has been greatly improved of recent years. Sir\r\nWilliam Gregory when governor did much to restore the ancient Kandy\r\ndecorations, while the Victoria Jubilee Commemoration Building,\r\nincluding \"Ferguson Memorial Hall,\" and two fine hotels, add to the\r\nimprovements. The Royal Botanic Gardens are situated at Peradeniya, 3 m.\r\ndistant. Kandy is a uniquely beautiful, highland, tropical town, full of\r\ninteresting historical and Buddhistic associations. A water supply and\r\nelectric lighting have been introduced. Roman Catholic missions are\r\nactive in the work of education, for which a large block of buildings\r\nhas been erected. Church of England, Wesleyan and Baptist missions are\r\nalso at work. The population of the town in 1900 was 26,386; of the\r\ndistrict, 377,591. Average annual rainfall, 81(1/2) in.; average\r\ntemperature, 75.3. There is a branch railway from Kandy, north to\r\nMatale, 17 m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANE, ELISHA KENT (1820-1857), American scientist and explorer, was born\r\nin Philadelphia on the 20th of February 1820, the son of the jurist John\r\nKintzing Kane (1795-1858), a friend and supporter of Andrew Jackson,\r\nattorney-general of Pennsylvania in 1845-1846, U.S. judge of the Eastern\r\nDistrict of Pennsylvania after 1846, and president of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society in 1856-1858. Young Kane entered the university of\r\nVirginia and obtained the degree of M.D. in 1842, and in the following\r\nyear entered the U.S. navy as surgeon. He had already acquired a\r\nconsiderable reputation in physiological research. The ship to which he\r\nwas appointed was ordered to China, and he found opportunities during\r\nthe voyage for indulging his passion for exploration, making a journey\r\nfrom Rio de Janeiro to the base of the Andes, and another from Bombay\r\nthrough India to Ceylon. On the arrival of the ship at its destination\r\nhe provided a substitute for his post and crossed over to the island of\r\nLuzon, which he explored. In 1844 he left China, and, returning by\r\nIndia, Persia, Syria, Egypt, Greece, Austria, Germany and Switzerland,\r\nreached America in 1846. In that year he was ordered to the west coast\r\nof Africa, where he visited Dahomey, and contracted fever, which told\r\nseverely on his constitution. On his return in 1847, he exchanged the\r\nnaval for the military service, and was sent to join the U.S. army in\r\nMexico, where he had some extraordinary adventures, and where he was\r\nagain stricken with fever.\r\n\r\nOn the fitting out of the first Grinnell expedition, in 1850, to search\r\nfor Sir John Franklin, Kane was appointed surgeon and naturalist under\r\nLieut. de Haven, who commanded the ships \"Advance\" and \"Rescue.\" The\r\nexpedition, after an absence of sixteen months, during nine of which the\r\nships were ice-bound, returned without having found any trace of the\r\nmissing vessels. Kane was in feeble health, but worked on at his\r\nnarrative of the expedition, which was published in 1854, under the\r\ntitle of _The U.S. Grinnell Expedition in Search of Sir John Franklin_.\r\nHe was determined not to give up the search for Franklin, and in spite\r\nof ill-health travelled through the States lecturing to obtain funds,\r\nand gave up his pay for twenty months. At length Henry Grinnell fitted\r\nout an expedition, in the little brig \"Advance,\" of which Kane was given\r\nthe command. She sailed in June 1853, and passing up Smith Sound at the\r\nhead of Baffin Bay advanced into the enclosed sea which now bears the\r\nname of Kane Basin, thus establishing the Polar route of many future\r\nArctic expeditions. Here, off the coast of Greenland, the expedition\r\npassed two winters, accomplishing much useful geographical, as well as\r\nscientific, work, including the attainment of what was to remain for\r\nsixteen years the highest northern latitude, 80 deg. 35' N. (June 1854).\r\nFrom this point a large area of open water was seen which was believed\r\nto be an \"open Polar Sea,\" a chimera which played an important and\r\ndelusive role in subsequent explorations. After enduring the greatest\r\nhardships it was resolved to abandon the ship, Upernivik being reached\r\non the 5th of August 1855, whence a relief expedition brought the\r\nexplorers home. Medals were authorized by Congress, and in the following\r\nyear Dr Kane received the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, and, two years later, a gold medal from the Paris Geographical\r\nSociety. He published _The Second Grinnell Expedition_ in 1856. Dr Kane\r\ndied at Havana on the 16th of February 1857, at the age of thirty-seven.\r\nBetween his first and second arctic voyages he made the acquaintance of\r\nthe Fox family, the spiritualists. With one of the daughters, Margaret,\r\nhe carried on a long correspondence, which was afterwards published by\r\nthe lady, who declared that they were privately married.\r\n\r\n  See _Biography of E. K. Kane_, by William Elder (1858); _Life of E. K.\r\n  Kane and other American Explorers_, by S. M. Smucker (1858); _The\r\n  Love-Life of Dr Kane, containing the Correspondence and a History of\r\n  the Engagement and Secret Marriage between E. K. Kane and Margaret\r\n  Fox_ (New York, 1866); \"Discoveries of Dr Kane,\" in _Jour. of the Roy.\r\n  Geog. Soc._, vol. xxviii. (reprinted in _R. G. S.

(1890), 2944; (1900), 5296, (971 foreign-born);\r\n(1910) 6626. It is served by the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore & Ohio, the\r\nKane & Elk, and the Big Level & Kinzua railways. It is situated about\r\n2015 ft. above the sea in a region producing natural gas, oil, lumber\r\nand silica, and has some reputation as a summer resort. The borough has\r\nmanufactories of window glass, plate glass and bottles, and repair shops\r\nof the Pennsylvania railroad. Kane was settled in 1859, and was\r\nincorporated as a borough in 1887. It was named in honour of its founder\r\nGen. Thomas L. Kane (1822-1883), brother of Elisha Kent Kane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANGAROO, the universally accepted, though not apparently the native,\r\ndesignation of the more typical representatives of the marsupial family\r\n_Macropodidae_ (see MARSUPIALIA). Although intimately connected with the\r\ncuscuses and phalangers by means of the musk-kangaroo, the kangaroos and\r\nwallabies, together with the rat-kangaroos, are easily distinguishable\r\nfrom other diprotodont marsupials by their general conformation, and by\r\npeculiarities in the structure of their limbs, teeth and other organs.\r\nThey vary in size from that of a sheep to a small rabbit. The head,\r\nespecially in the larger species, is small, compared with the rest of\r\nthe body, and tapers forward to the muzzle. The shoulders and fore-limbs\r\nare feebly developed, and the hind-limbs of disproportionate strength\r\nand magnitude, which give the animals a peculiarly awkward appearance\r\nwhen moving about on all-fours, as they occasionally do when feeding.\r\nRapid progression is, however, performed only by the powerful\r\nhind-limbs, the animals covering the ground by a series of immense\r\nbounds, during which the fore part of the body is inclined forwards, and\r\nbalanced by the long, strong and tapering tail, which is carried\r\nhorizontally backwards. When not moving, they often assume a perfectly\r\nupright position, the tail aiding the two hind-legs to form a tripod,\r\nand the front-limbs dangling by the side of the chest. This position\r\ngives full scope for the senses of sight, hearing and smell to warn of\r\nthe approach of enemies. The fore-paws have five digits, each armed with\r\na strong, curved claw. The hind-foot is extremely long, narrow and\r\n(except in the musk-kangaroo) without the first toe. It consists mainly\r\nof one very large and strong toe, corresponding to the fourth of the\r\nhuman foot, ending in a strong curved and pointed claw (fig. 2). Close\r\nto the outer side of this lies a smaller fifth digit, and to the inner\r\nside two excessively slender toes (the second and third), bound together\r\nalmost to the extremity in a common integument. The two little claws of\r\nthese toes, projecting together from the skin, may be of use in\r\nscratching and cleaning the fur of the animal, but the toes must have\r\nquite lost all connexion with the functions of support or progression.\r\nThis type of foot-structure is termed syndactylous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The Great Grey Kangaroo (_Macropus giganteus_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Skeleton of right hind-foot of Kangaroo.]\r\n\r\nThe dental formula, when completely developed, is _incisors_ 3/1,\r\n_canines_ 1/0, _premolars_ 3/3, _molars_ 3/3 on each side, giving a\r\ntotal of 34 teeth. The three incisors of the upper jaw are arranged in a\r\ncontinuous arched series, and have crowns with broad cutting edges; the\r\nfirst or middle incisor is often larger than the others. Corresponding\r\nto these in the lower jaw is but one tooth on each side, which is of\r\ngreat size, directed horizontally forwards, narrow, lanceolate and\r\npointed with sharp edges. Owing to the slight union of the two halves of\r\nthe lower jaw in front in many species the two lower incisors work\r\ntogether like the blades of a pair of scissors. The canines are absent\r\nor rudimentary in the lower, and often deciduous at an early age in the\r\nupper jaw. The first two premolars are compressed, with cutting\r\nlongitudinal edges, the anterior one is deciduous, being lost about the\r\ntime the second one replaces the milk-molar, so that three premolars are\r\nnever found in place and use in the same individual. The last premolar\r\nand the molars have quadrate crowns, provided with two strong transverse\r\nridges, or with four obtuse cusps. In _Macropus giganteus_ and its\r\nimmediate allies, the premolars and sometimes the first molar are shed,\r\nso that in old examples only the two posterior molars and the incisors\r\nare found in place. The milk-dentition, as in other marsupials, is\r\nconfined to a single tooth on each side of each jaw, the other molars\r\nand incisors being never changed. The dentition of the kangaroos,\r\nfunctionally considered, thus consists of sharp-edged incisors, most\r\ndeveloped near the median line of the mouth, for the purpose of cropping\r\nherbage, and ridged or tuberculated molars for crushing.\r\n\r\nThe number of vertebrae is--in the cervical region 7, dorsal 13, lumbar\r\n6, sacral 2, caudal varying according to the length of the tail, but\r\ngenerally from 21 to 25. In the fore-limb the clavicle and the radius\r\nand ulna are well developed, allowing of considerable freedom of motion\r\nof the fore-paw. The pelvis has large epipubic or \"marsupial\" bones. The\r\nfemur is short, and the tibia and fibula of great length, as is the\r\nfoot, the whole of which is applied to the ground when the animal is at\r\nrest in the upright position.\r\n\r\nThe stomach is large and very complex, its walls being puckered by\r\nlongitudinal muscular bands into a number of folds. The alimentary canal\r\nis long, and the caecum well developed. The young (which, as in other\r\nmarsupials, leave the uterus in an extremely small and imperfect\r\ncondition) are placed in the pouch as soon as they are born; and to this\r\nthey resort temporarily for shelter for some time after they are able to\r\nrun, jump and feed upon the herbage which forms the nourishment of the\r\nparent. During the early period of their sojourn in the pouch, the\r\nblind, naked, helpless young creatures (which in the great kangaroo\r\nscarcely exceed an inch in length) are attached by their mouths to the\r\nnipple of the mother, and are fed by milk injected into their stomach by\r\nthe contraction of the muscle covering the mammary gland. In this stage\r\nof existence the elongated upper part of the larynx projects into the\r\nposterior nares, and so maintains a free communication between the lungs\r\nand the external surface, independently of the mouth and gullet, thus\r\naverting danger of suffocation while the milk is passing down the\r\ngullet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Skull and teeth of Bennett's Wallaby (_Macropus\r\nruficollis bennettii_): i^1, i^2, i^3, first, second and third upper\r\nincisors; pm, second premolar (the first having been already shed); m^1,\r\nm^2, m^3, m^4, last premolar and three molars. The last, not fully\r\ndeveloped, is nearly concealed by the ascending part of the lower jaw.]\r\n\r\nKangaroos are vegetable-feeders, browsing on grass and various kinds of\r\nherbage, but the smaller species also eat roots. They are naturally\r\ntimid and inoffensive, but the larger kinds when hard pressed will turn\r\nand defend themselves, sometimes killing a dog by grasping it in their\r\nfore-paws, and inflicting terrible wounds with the sharp claws of their\r\npowerful hind-legs, supporting themselves meanwhile upon the tail. The\r\nmajority are inhabitants of Australia and Tasmania, forming one of the\r\nmost prominent and characteristic features of the fauna of these lands,\r\nand performing the part of the deer and antelopes of other parts of the\r\nworld. They were important sources of food-supply to the natives, and\r\nare hunted by the colonists, both for sport and on account of the damage\r\nthey do in consuming grass required for cattle and sheep. A few species\r\nare found in New Guinea, and the adjacent islands, which belong, in the\r\nzoological sense, to the Australian province, beyond the bounds of which\r\nnone occurs.\r\n\r\n  The more typical representatives of the group constitute the\r\n  sub-family _Macropodinae_, in which the cutting-edges of the upper\r\n  incisors are nearly level, or the first pair but slightly longer than\r\n  the others (fig. 3). The canines are rudimentary and often wanting.\r\n  The molars are usually not longer (from before backwards) than the\r\n  anterior premolars, and less compressed than in the next section. The\r\n  crowns of the molars have two prominent transverse ridges. The\r\n  fore-limbs are small with subequal toes, armed with strong, moderately\r\n  long, curved claws. Hind-limbs very long and strongly made. Head\r\n  small, with more or less elongated muzzle. Ears generally rather long\r\n  and ovate.\r\n\r\n  The typical genus _Macropus_, in which the muzzle is generally naked,\r\n  the ears large, the fur on the nape of the neck usually directed\r\n  backwards, the claw of the fourth hind-toe very large, and the tail\r\n  stout and tapering, includes a large number of species. Among these,\r\n  the great grey kangaroo (_M. giganteus_, fig. 1) deserves special\r\n  mention on account of having been discovered during Captain Cook's\r\n  first voyage in 1770. The great red kangaroo (_M. rufus_) is about the\r\n  same size, while other large species are _M. antilopinus_ and _M.\r\n  robustus_. The larger wallabies, or brush-kangaroos, such as the\r\n  red-necked wallaby (_M. ruficollis_) constitute a group of\r\n  smaller-sized species; while the smaller wallabies, such as the\r\n  filander (q.v.) (_M. muelleri_) and _M. thetidis_, constitute yet\r\n  another section. The genus ranges from the eastern Austro-Malay\r\n  islands to New Guinea.\r\n\r\n  Nearly allied are the rock-wallabies of Australia and Tasmania,\r\n  constituting the genus _Petrogale_, chiefly distinguished by the\r\n  thinner tail being more densely haired and terminating in a tuff.\r\n  Well-known species are _P. penicillata_, _P. xanthopus_ and _P.\r\n  lateralis_. The few species of nail-tailed wallabies, _Onychogale_,\r\n  which are confined to the Australian mainland, take their name from\r\n  the presence of a horny spur at the end of the tail, and are further\r\n  distinguished by the hairy muzzle. _O. unguifer_, _O. fraenatus_ and\r\n  _O. lunatus_ represent the group. The hare-wallabies, such as\r\n  _Lagorchestes leporoides_, _L. hirsutus_ and _L. consepicillatus_,\r\n  constitute a genus with the same distribution as the last, and\r\n  likewise with a hairy muzzle, but with a rather short, evenly furred\r\n  tail, devoid of a spur. They are great leapers and swift runners,\r\n  mostly frequenting open stony plains.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Skull and teeth of Lesueuir's Rat-Kangaroo\r\n  (_Bettongia lesueuiri_). c, upper canine. Other letters as in fig. 3.\r\n  The anterior premolar has been shed.]\r\n\r\n  More distinct is the Papuan genus _Dorcopsis_, as typified by _D.\r\n  muelleri_, although it is to some extent connected with _Macropus_ by\r\n  _D. macleyi_. The muzzle is naked, the fur on the nape of the neck\r\n  directed more or less completely forward, and the hind-limbs are less\r\n  disproportionately elongated. Perhaps, however, the most distinctive\r\n  feature of the genus is the great fore-and-aft length of the\r\n  penultimate premolar in both jaws. Other species are _D.\r\n  rufolateralis_ and _D. aurantiacus_. In the tree-kangaroos, which\r\n  include the Papuan _Dendrolagus inustus_, _D. ursinus_, _D. dorianus_,\r\n  _D. benetianus_ and _D. maximus_, and the North Queensland _D.\r\n  lumholtzi_, the reduction in the length of the hind-limbs is carried\r\n  to a still further degree, so that the proportions of the fore and\r\n  hind limbs are almost normal. The genus agrees with _Dorcopsis_ in the\r\n  direction of the hair on the neck, but the muzzle is only partially\r\n  hairy, and the elongation of the penultimate premolar is less. These\r\n  kangaroos are largely arboreal in their habits, but they descend to\r\n  the ground to feed. Lastly, we have the banded wallaby, _Lagostrophus\r\n  fasciatus_, of Western Australia, a small species characterized by its\r\n  naked muzzle, the presence of long bristles on the hind-feet which\r\n  conceal the claws, and also of dark transverse bands on the lower part\r\n  of the back. The skull has a remarkably narrow and pointed muzzle and\r\n  much inflated auditory bullae; while the two halves of the lower jaw\r\n  are firmly welded together at their junction, thus effectually\r\n  preventing the scissor-like action of the lower incisors distinctive\r\n  of _Macropus_ and its immediate allies. As regards the teeth, canines\r\n  are wanting, and the penultimate upper premolar is short, from before\r\n  backwards, with a distinct ledge on the inner side.\r\n\r\n  In the rat-kangaroos, or kangaroo-rats, as they are called in\r\n  Australia, constituting the sub-family _Potoroinae_, the first upper\r\n  incisor is narrow, curved, and much exceeds the others in length; the\r\n  upper canines are persistent, flattened, blunt and slightly curved,\r\n  and the first two premolars of both jaws have large, simple,\r\n  compressed crowns, with a nearly straight or slightly concave free\r\n  cutting-edge, and both outer and inner surfaces usually marked by a\r\n  series of parallel, vertical grooves and ridges. Molars with quadrate\r\n  crowns and a blunt conical cusp at each corner, the last notably\r\n  smaller than the rest, sometimes rudimentary or absent. Forefeet\r\n  narrow; the three middle toes considerably exceeding the first and\r\n  fifth in length and their claws long, compressed and but slightly\r\n  curved. Hind-feet as in _Macropus_. Tail long, and sometimes partially\r\n  prehensile when it is used for carrying bundles of grass with which\r\n  these animals build their nests. The group is confined to Australia\r\n  and Tasmania, and all the species are relatively small.\r\n\r\n  In the members of the typical genus _Potorous_ (formerly known as\r\n  _Hypsiprymnus_) the head is long and slender, with the auditory bullae\r\n  somewhat swollen; while the ridges on the first two premolars are few\r\n  and perpendicular, and there are large vacuities on the palate. The\r\n  tarsus is short and the muzzle naked. The genus includes _P.\r\n  tridactylus_, _P. gilberti_ and _P. platyops_. In _Bettongia_, on the\r\n  other hand, the head is shorter and wider, with smaller and more\r\n  rounded ears, and more swollen auditory bullae. The ridges on the\r\n  first two premolars are also more numerous and somewhat oblique (fig.\r\n  4); the tarsus is long and the tail is prehensile. The species include\r\n  _B. lesueuiri_, _B. gaimardi_ and _B. cuniculus_. The South Australian\r\n  _Caloprymnus campestris_ represents a genus near akin to the last, but\r\n  with the edge of the hairy border of the bare muzzle less emarginate\r\n  in the middle line, still more swollen auditory bullae, very large and\r\n  posterially expanded nasals and longer vacuities on the palate. The\r\n  list is completed by _Aepyprymnus rufescens_, which differs from all\r\n  the others by the hairy muzzle, and the absence of inflation in the\r\n  auditory bullae and of vacuities in the palate.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps, however, the most interesting member of the whole group is\r\n  the tiny musk-kangaroo (_Hypsiprymnodon moschatus_) of north-east\r\n  Australia, which alone represents the sub-family\r\n  _Hypsiprymnodontinae_, characterized by the presence of an opposable\r\n  first toe on the hind-foot and the outward inclination of the\r\n  penultimate upper premolar, as well by the small and feeble claws. In\r\n  all these features the musk-kangaroo connects the _Macropodidae_ with\r\n  the _Phalangeridae_. The other teeth are like those of the\r\n  rat-kangaroos.     (W. H. F.; R. L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANGAROO-RAT, a name applied in different parts of the world to two\r\nwidely different groups of mammals. In Australia it is used to denote\r\nthe small kangaroo-like marsupials technically known as _Potoroinae_,\r\nwhich zoologists prefer to call rat-kangaroos (see MARSUPIALIA and\r\nKANGAROO). In North America it is employed for certain small jumping\r\nrat-like rodents nearly allied to the pocket-gophers and belonging to\r\nthe family _Geomyidae_. Kangaroo-rats in this latter series are\r\nrepresented by three North American genera, of which _Dipodomys\r\nphillipsi_, _Cricetodipus agilis_ and _Microdipodops megacephalus_ may\r\nrespectively be taken as examples. Resembling pocket-gophers in the\r\npossession of cheek-pouches, kangaroo-rats, together with pocket-mice,\r\nare distinguished by their elongated hind-limbs and tails, large eyes,\r\nwell-developed ears and general jerboa-like appearance and habits. The\r\nupper incisor teeth are also relatively narrower, and there are\r\nimportant differences in the skull. The cheek-teeth are rootless in\r\nkangaroo-rats, but they develop roots in the pocket-mice. The former\r\ninhabit open, sandy districts, where they burrow beneath rocks or\r\nstones, and hop about like jerboas; their food consisting of grasses and\r\nother plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANGAVAR, a small district of Persia, situated between Hamadan and\r\nKermanshah, and, being held in fief by the family of a deceased court\r\nofficial, forming a separate government. The district is very fertile\r\nand contains 30 villages. Its revenues amount to about L500 per annum,\r\nand its chief place is the large village of Kangavar, which has a\r\npopulation of about 2500 and is 47 m. from Hamadan on the high road to\r\nKermanshah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANGRA, a town and district of British India, in the Jullundur division\r\nof the Punjab. The town, sometimes called Nagarkot, is situated 2409 ft.\r\nabove the sea. Pop. (1901), 4746. The Katoch rajas had a stronghold\r\nhere, with a fort and rich temples. Mahmud of Ghazni took the fort in\r\n1009 and from one of the temples carried off a vast treasure. In 1360\r\nKangra was again plundered, by Feroz Shah. The temple of Devi Bajreshri\r\nwas one of the oldest and wealthiest in northern India. It was\r\ndestroyed, together with the fort and the town, by an earthquake on the\r\n4th of April 1905, when 1339 lives were lost in this place alone, and\r\nabout 20,000 elsewhere. In 1855 the headquarters of the district were\r\nremoved to the sanitarium of Dharmsala.\r\n\r\nThe district of Kangra extends from the Jullundur Doab far into the\r\nsouthern ranges of the Himalaya. Besides some Rajput states, annexed\r\nafter the Sikh wars, it includes Lahul, Spiti and Kulu, which are\r\nessentially Tibetan. The Beas is the only important river. Area, 9978\r\nsq. m., of which Kangra proper has only 2725. Pop. (1901), 768,124;\r\naverage density 77 persons per sq. m., but with only one person per sq.\r\nm. in Spiti. Tea cultivation was introduced into Kangra about 1850. The\r\nPalampur fair, established by government with a view to fostering\r\ncommerce with central Asia, attracts a small concourse of Yarkandi\r\nmerchants. The Lahulis carry on an enterprising trade with Ladakh and\r\ncountries beyond the frontier, by means of pack sheep and goats. Rice,\r\ntea, potatoes, opium, spices, wool and honey are the chief exports.\r\n\r\n  See _Kangra District Gazetteer_ (Lahore, 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANISHKA, king of Kabul, Kashmir, and north-western India in the 2nd\r\ncentury A.D., was a Tatar of the Kushan tribe, one of the five into\r\nwhich the Yue-chi Tatars were divided. His dominions extended as far\r\ndown into India as Madura, and probably as far to the north-west as\r\nBokhara. Private inscriptions found in the Punjab and Sind, in the\r\nYusufzai district and at Madura, and referred by European scholars to\r\nhis reign, are dated in the years five to twenty-eight of an unknown\r\nera. It is the references by Chinese historians to the Yue-chi tribes\r\nbefore their incursion into India, together with conclusions drawn from\r\nthe history of art and literature in his reign, that render the date\r\ngiven the most probable. Kanishka's predecessors on the throne were\r\nPagans; but shortly after his accession he professed himself, probably\r\nfrom political reasons, a Buddhist. He spent vast sums in the\r\nconstruction of Buddhist monuments; and under his auspices the fourth\r\nBuddhist council, the council of Jalandhara (Jullunder) was convened\r\nunder the presidency of Vasumitra. At this council three treatises,\r\ncommentaries on the Canon, one on each of the three baskets into which\r\nit is divided, were composed. King Kanishka had these treatises, when\r\ncompleted and revised by Asvaghosha, written out on copper plates, and\r\nenclosed the latter in stone boxes, which he placed in a memorial mound.\r\nFor some centuries afterwards these works survived in India; but they\r\nexist now only in Chinese translations or adaptations. We are not told\r\nin what language they were written. It was probably Sanskrit (not Pali,\r\nthe language of the Canon)--just as in Europe we have works of\r\nexegetical commentary composed, in Latin, on the basis of the Testament\r\nand Septuagint in Greek. This change of the language used as a medium of\r\nliterary intercourse was partly the cause, partly the effect, of a\r\ncomplete revulsion in the intellectual life of India. The reign of\r\nKanishka was certainly the turning-point in this remarkable change. It\r\nhas been suggested with great plausibility, that the wide extent of his\r\ndomains facilitated the incursion into India of Western modes of\r\nthought; and thus led in the first place to the corruption and gradual\r\ndecline of Buddhism, and secondly to the gradual rise of Hinduism. Only\r\nthe publication of the books written at the time will enable us to say\r\nwhether this hypothesis--for at present it is nothing more--is really a\r\nsufficient explanation of the very important results of his reign. In\r\nany case it was a migration of nomad hordes in Central Asia that led, in\r\nEurope, to the downfall of the Roman civilization; and then, through the\r\nconversion of the invaders, to medieval conditions of life and thought.\r\nIt was the very same migration of nomad hordes that led, in India, to\r\nthe downfall of the Buddhist civilization; and subsequently, after the\r\nconversion of the Saka and Tatar invaders, to medieval Hinduism. As\r\nIndia was nearer to the starting-point of the migration, its results\r\nwere felt there somewhat sooner.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Vincent A.

(1900), 13,595, of whom 3346 were foreign-born; (1910\r\ncensus), 13,986. Kankakee is served by the Cleveland, Cincinnati,\r\nChicago & St Louis, the Illinois Central, and the Chicago, Indiana &\r\nSouthern (controlled by the New York Central) railways. It is the seat\r\nof the Eastern Hospital for the Insane (1879) a state institution; St\r\nJoseph's Seminary (Roman Catholic) and a Conservatory of Music. At\r\nBourbonnais Grove, 3 m. N. of Kankakee is St Viateur's College (founded\r\n1868), a well-known Roman Catholic divinity school, and Notre Dame\r\nAcademy, another Catholic institution. The city has a public library and\r\nfour large parks; in Court House Square there is a monument erected by\r\npopular subscription in honour of the soldiers from Kankakee county who\r\ndied in the Civil War. There are rock quarries here, and the city\r\nmanufactures sewing machines, musical instruments, especially pianos,\r\nfoundry and machine shop products, agricultural implements and\r\nfurniture. The total value of the factory product in 1905 was\r\n$2,089,143, an increase of 222% since 1900. Kankakee is also a shipping\r\npoint for agricultural products. It was first settled in 1832; was\r\nplatted as the town of Bourbonnais in 1853, when Kankakee county was\r\nfirst organized; was chartered as the city of Kankakee in 1855, and was\r\nre-chartered in 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANKER, a feudatory state of India, within the Central Provinces; area,\r\n1429 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 103,536; estimated revenue, L10,000. It is a\r\nhilly tract, containing the headwaters of the Mahanadi. The extensive\r\nforests have recently been made profitable by the opening of a branch\r\nrailway. The residence of the raja, who is of an old Rajput family\r\nthough ruling over Gonds, is at Kanker (pop. 3906).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANO, one of the most important provinces of the British protectorate of\r\nNorthern Nigeria. It includes the ancient emirates of Kano, Katsena,\r\nDaura and Kazaure, and covers an area of about 31,000 sq. m. The\r\nsub-province of Katagum was incorporated with Kano in 1905, and is\r\nincluded within this area. The population of the double province is\r\nestimated at about 2,250,000.\r\n\r\nKano was one of the original seven Hausa states. Written annals carry\r\nthe record of its kings back to about A.D. 900. Legendary history goes\r\nback much further. It was conquered by the Songhoi (Songhay) in the\r\nearly part of the 16th century, and more than once appears to have made\r\nat least partial submission to Bornu. Mahommedanism was introduced at a\r\nperiod which, according to the system adopted for the dating of the\r\nannals, must be placed either in the 12th or the 14th century. The Hausa\r\nsystem of government and taxation was adopted by the Fula when in the\r\nearly part of the 19th century that Mahommedan people overran the Hausa\r\nstates. It has been erroneously stated that the Fula imposed\r\nMahommedanism on the Hausa states. The fact that they adopted the\r\nexisting system of government and taxation, which are based upon Koranic\r\nlaw, would in itself be sufficient proof that this was not the case. But\r\nthe annals of Kano distinctly record the introduction and describe the\r\ndevelopment of Mahommedanism at an early period of local history.\r\n\r\nThe capital is the city of Kano, situated in 12 deg. N. and 8 deg. 20'\r\nE., 220 m. S.S.E. of Sokoto and 500 N.E. of Lagos. It is built on an\r\nopen plain, and is encompassed by a wall 11 m. in perimeter and pierced\r\nby thirteen gates. The wall is from 30 to 50 ft. high and about 40 ft.\r\nthick at the base. Round the wall is a deep double ditch, a dwarf wall\r\nrunning along its centre. The gates are simply cow-hide, but are set in\r\nmassive entrance towers. Only about a third of the area (7(1/4) sq. m.)\r\nenclosed by the walls is inhabited nor was the whole space ever occupied\r\nby buildings, the intention of the founders of the city being to wall in\r\nground sufficient to grow food for the inhabitants during a siege. The\r\narable land within the city is mainly on the west and north; only to the\r\nsouth-east do the houses come right to the walls. Within the walls are\r\ntwo steep hills, one, Dala, about 120 ft. high being the most ancient\r\nquarter of the town. Dala lies north-west. To its east is a great pond,\r\nthe Jakara, 1(1/2) m. long, and by its north-east shore is the market of\r\nthe Arab merchants. Here also was the slave market. The palace of the\r\nemir, in front of which is a large open space, is in the Fula quarter in\r\nthe south-east of the city. The palace consists of a number of buildings\r\ncovering 33 acres and surrounded by a wall 20 to 30 ft. high. The\r\narchitecture of the city is not without merit. The houses are built of\r\nclay with (generally) flat roofs impervious to fire. Traces of Moorish\r\ninfluence are evident and the horse-shoe arch is common. The audience\r\nhall of the emir's palace--25 ft. sq. and 18 ft. high--is decorated with\r\ndesigns in black, white, green and yellow, the yellow designs (formed of\r\nmicaceous sand) glistening like gold. The dome-shaped roof is supported\r\nby twenty arches.\r\n\r\nThe city is divided into fourteen quarters, each presided over by a\r\nheadman, and inhabited by separate sections of the community. It is\r\nprobably the greatest commercial city in the central Sudan. Other towns,\r\nlike Zaria, may do as much trade, but Kano is pre-eminent as a\r\nmanufacturing centre. The chief industry is the weaving of cloth from\r\nnative grown cotton. Leather goods of all kinds are also manufactured,\r\nand from Kano come most of the \"morocco leather\" goods on the European\r\nmarkets. Dyeing is another large trade, as is the preparation of indigo.\r\nOf traders there are four distinct classes. They are: (1) Arabs from\r\nTripoli, who export ostrich feathers, skins and ivory, and bring in\r\nburnouses, scents, sweets, tea, sugar, &c.; (2) Salaga merchants who\r\nimport kola nuts from the hinterland of the Guinea Coast, taking in\r\nexchange cloth and live stock and leather and other goods; (3) the\r\nAsbenawa traders, who come from the oases of Asben or Air with camels\r\nladen with salt and \"potash\" (i.e. sodium carbonates), and with herds of\r\ncattle and sheep, receiving in return cotton and hardware and kolas; (4)\r\nthe Hausa merchants. This last class trades with the other three and\r\ndespatches caravans to Illorin and other places, where the Kano goods,\r\nthe \"potash\" and other merchandise are exchanged for kolas and European\r\ngoods. The \"potash\" finds a ready sale among the Yorubas, being largely\r\nused for cooking purposes. In Kano itself is a great market for\r\nlivestock: camels, horses, oxen, asses and goats being on sale.\r\n\r\nBesides Hausa, who represent the indigenous population, there are large\r\ncolonies of Kanuri (from Bornu) and Nupians in Kano. The Fula form the\r\naristocratic class. The population is said to amount to 100,000. About a\r\nmile and a half east of Kano is Nassarawa, formerly the emir's suburban\r\nresidence, but since 1902 the British Residency and barracks.\r\n\r\n  The city of Kano appears on the map of the Arab geographer, Idrisi,\r\n  A.D. 1145, and the hill of Dala is mentioned in the earliest records\r\n  as the original site of Kano. Barth, however, concluded that the\r\n  present town does not date earlier than the second half of the 16th\r\n  century, and that before the rise of the Fula power (c. 1800) scarcely\r\n  any great Arab merchant ever visited Kano. The present town may be the\r\n  successor of an older town occupying a position of similar\r\n  pre-eminence. Kano submitted to the Fula without much resistance, and\r\n  under them in the first half of the 19th century flourished greatly.\r\n  It was visited by Hugh Clapperton, an English officer, in 1824, and in\r\n  it Barth lived some time in 1851 and again in 1854. Barth's\r\n  descriptions of the wealth and importance of the city attracted great\r\n  attention in Europe, and Kano was subsequently visited by several\r\n  travellers, missionaries, and students of Hausa, but none was\r\n  permitted to live permanently in the city. In the closing years of the\r\n  century, Kano became the centre of resistance to British influence,\r\n  and the emir, Alieu, was the most inveterate of Fula slave raiders. In\r\n  February 1903 the city was captured by a British force under Colonel\r\n  T. L. N. Morland, and a new emir, Abbas, a brother of Alieu,\r\n  installed.\r\n\r\n  After the occupation by the British in 1903 the province was organized\r\n  for administration on the same system as that adopted throughout\r\n  northern Nigeria. The emir on his installation takes an oath of\r\n  allegiance to the British Crown, and accepts the position of a chief\r\n  of the first class under British rule. A resident is placed at his\r\n  court, and assistant residents have their headquarters in the\r\n  administrative districts of the province. British courts of justice\r\n  are established side by side with the native courts throughout the\r\n  province. Taxation is assessed under British supervision and paid into\r\n  the native treasury. A fixed portion is paid by the emir to the\r\n  British government. The emir is not allowed to maintain a standing\r\n  army, and the city of Kano is the headquarters of the British\r\n  garrison. The conditions of appointment of the emirs are fully laid\r\n  down in the terms accepted at Sokoto on the close of the Sokoto-Kano\r\n  campaign of 1903. Since the introduction of British rule there has\r\n  been no serious trouble in the province. The emir Abbas worked loyally\r\n  with the British and proved himself a ruler of remarkable ability and\r\n  intelligence. He was indefatigable in dispensing justice, and himself\r\n  presided over a native court in which he disposed of from fifty to a\r\n  hundred cases a month. He also took an active interest in the reform\r\n  and reorganization of the system of taxation, and in the opening of\r\n  the country to trade. He further showed himself helpful in arranging\r\n  difficulties which at times arose in connexion with the lesser chiefs\r\n  of his province.\r\n\r\n  The province of Kano is generally fertile. For a radius of 30 m. round\r\n  the capital the country is closely cultivated and densely populated,\r\n  with some 40 walled towns and with villages and hamlets hardly half a\r\n  mile apart. Kano district proper contains 170 walled towns and about\r\n  450 villages. There are many streams, but water is chiefly obtained\r\n  from wells 15 to 40 ft. deep. The principal crops are African grains,\r\n  wheat, onions, cotton, tobacco, indigo, with sugar-cane, cassava, &c.\r\n  The population is chiefly agricultural, but also commercial and\r\n  industrial. The chief industries are weaving, leather-making, dyeing\r\n  and working in iron and pottery. Cattle are abundant.

(F. L. L.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS (known as the \"Sunflower State\"), the central commonwealth of the\r\nUnited States of America, lying between 37 deg. and 40 deg. N. lat. and\r\nbetween 94 deg. 38' and 102 deg. 1' 34\" W. long. (i.e. 25 deg. W. long,\r\nfrom Washington). It is bounded on the N. by Nebraska, on the E. by\r\nMissouri, on the S. by Oklahoma, and on the W. by Colorado. The state is\r\nnearly rectangular in shape, with a breadth of about 210 m. from N. to\r\nS. and a length of about 410 m. from E. to W. It contains an area of\r\n82,158 sq. m. (including 384 sq. m. of water surface).\r\n\r\n_Physiography._--Three physiographic regions may be distinguished within\r\nthe state--the first, a small portion of the Ozark uplift in the extreme\r\nsouth-east corner; the second, the Prairie Plains, covering\r\napproximately the east third of the state; the third, the Great Plains,\r\ncovering the remaining area. Between the latter two there is only the\r\nmost gradual transition. The entire state is indeed practically an\r\nundulating plain, gently sloping from west to east at an average of\r\nabout 7 ft. per mile. There is also an inclination in the eastern half\r\nfrom north to south, as indicated by the course of the rivers, most of\r\nwhich flow south-easterly (the Kansas, with its general easterly course,\r\nis the principal exception), the north-west corner being the highest\r\nportion of the state. The lowest point in the state in its south-east\r\npart, in Montgomery county, is 725 ft. above sea level. The average\r\nelevation of the east boundary is about 850 ft., while contour lines of\r\n3500-3900 ft. run near the west border. Somewhat more than half the\r\ntotal area is below 2000 ft. The gently rolling prairie surface is\r\ndiversified by an endless succession of broad plains, isolated hills and\r\nridges, and moderate valleys. In places there are terraced uplands, and\r\nin others the undulating plain is cut by erosion into low escarpments.\r\nThe bluffs on the Missouri are in places 200 ft. high, and the valley of\r\nthe Cimarron, in the south-west, has deep cuts, almost gorges. The west\r\ncentral portion has considerable irregularities of contour, and the\r\nnorth-west is distinctively hilly. In the south-west, below the Arkansas\r\nriver, is an area of sandhills, and the Ozark Plateau region, as above\r\nstated, extends into the south-east corner, though not there much\r\nelevated. The great central valley is traversed by the Kansas (or Kaw)\r\nriver, which, inclusive of the Smoky Hill Branch, extends the entire\r\nlength of the state, with lateral valleys on the north. Another broad\r\nvalley is formed in the south half of the state by the Arkansas river,\r\nwith lateral valleys on the north and south. The south-east portion\r\ncontains the important Neosho and smaller valleys. In the extreme\r\nsouth-west is the valley of the Cimarron, and along the south boundary\r\nis a network of the south tributaries of the Arkansas. Numerous small\r\naffluents of the Missouri enrich and diversify the north-east quarter.\r\nThe streams of Kansas are usually fed by perennial springs, and, as a\r\nrule, the east and middle portions of the state are well watered. Most\r\nof the streams maintain a good flow of water in the driest seasons, and\r\nin case of heavy rains many of them \"underflow\" the adjacent bottom\r\nlands, saturating the permeable substratum of the country with the\r\nsurplus water, which in time drains out and feeds the subsiding streams.\r\nThis feature is particularly true of the Saline, Solomon and Smoky Hill\r\nrivers. The west part is more elevated and water is less abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Kansas.]\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--The climate of Kansas is exceptionally salubrious.\r\n  Extremes of heat and cold occur, but as a rule the winters are dry and\r\n  mild, while the summer heats are tempered by the perpetual prairie\r\n  breezes, and the summer nights are usually cool and refreshing. The\r\n  average annual temperature of the state for seventeen years preceding\r\n  1903 was 54.3 deg. F., the warmest mean being 56.0 deg., the coldest\r\n  52.6 deg. The extreme variation of yearly means throughout the east,\r\n  west and middle sections during the same period was very slight, 51.6\r\n  deg. to 56.6 deg., and the greatest variation for any one section was\r\n  3.7 deg. The absolute extremes were 116 deg. and -34 deg. The dryness\r\n  of the air tempers exceedingly to the senses the cold of winter and\r\n  the heat of summer. The temperature over the state is much more\r\n  uniform than is the precipitation, which diminishes somewhat regularly\r\n  westward. In the above period of seventeen years the yearly means in\r\n  the west section varied from 11.93 to 29.21 in. (av. 19.21), in the\r\n  middle from 18.58 to 34.30 (av. 26.68), in the east from 26.00 to\r\n  45.71 (av. 34.78); the mean for the state ranging from 20.12 to 35.50\r\n  (av. 27.12).[1] The precipitation in the west is not sufficient for\r\n  confident agriculture in any series of years, since agriculture is\r\n  practically dependent upon the mean fall; a fact that has been and is\r\n  of profound importance in the history of the state. The line of 20 in.\r\n  fall (about the limit of certain agriculture) approximately bisects\r\n  the state in dry years. The precipitation is very largely in the\r\n  growing season--at Dodge the fall between April and October is 78% of\r\n  that for the year. Freshets and droughts at times work havoc. The\r\n  former made notable 1844 and 1858; and the latter 1860, 1874 and 1894.\r\n  Tornadoes are also a not infrequent infliction, least common in the\r\n  west. The years 1871, 1879, 1881 and 1892 were made memorable by\r\n  particularly severe storms. There are 150 to 175 \"growing days\" for\r\n  crops between the frosts of spring and autumn, and eight in ten days\r\n  are bright with sunshine--half of them without a cloud. Winds are\r\n  prevailingly from the south (in the winter often from the north-west).\r\n\r\n   _Fauna and Flora._--The fauna and flora of the state are those which\r\n  are characteristic of the plain region generally of which Kansas is a\r\n  part. The state lies partly in the humid, or Carolinian, and partly in\r\n  the arid, or Upper Sonoran, area of the Upper Austral life-zone; 100\r\n  deg. W. long. is approximately the dividing line between these areas.\r\n  The bison and elk have disappeared. A very great variety of birds is\r\n  found within the state, either as residents or as visitants from the\r\n  adjoining avifaunal regions--mountain, plain, northern and southern.\r\n  In 1886 Colonel N. S. Goss compiled a list of 335 species, of which\r\n  175 were known to breed in the state. The wild turkey, once abundant,\r\n  was near extermination in 1886, and prairie chickens (pinnated grouse)\r\n  have also greatly diminished in number. The jack-rabbit is\r\n  characteristic of the prairie. Locusts (\"grasshoppers\" in local usage)\r\n  have worked incalculable damage, notably in 1854, 1866, and above all\r\n  in 1874-1875. In the last two cases their ravages extended over a\r\n  great portion of the state.\r\n\r\n  Kansas has no forests. Along the streams there is commonly a fringe of\r\n  timber, which in the east is fairly heavy. There is an increasing\r\n  scarcity westward. With the advancing settlement of the state thin\r\n  wind-break rows become a feature of the prairies. The lessened ravages\r\n  of prairie fires have facilitated artificial afforesting, and many\r\n  cities, in particular, are abundantly and beautifully shaded. Oaks,\r\n  elms, hickory, honey-locusts, white ash, sycamore and willows, the\r\n  rapid growing but miserable box-elder and cottonwood, are the most\r\n  common trees. Black walnut was common in the river valleys in\r\n  Territorial days. The planting of tree reserves by the United States\r\n  government in the arid counties of this state promises great success.\r\n  A National Forest of 302,387 acres in Finney, Kearney, Hamilton and\r\n  Grant counties was set aside in May 1908. Buffalo and bunch, and other\r\n  short native prairie grasses, very nutritious ranging food but\r\n  unavailable as hay, once covered the plains and pastured immense herds\r\n  of buffalo and other animals, but with increasing settlement they have\r\n  given way generally to exotic bladed species, valuable alike for\r\n  pasture and for hay, except in the western regions. The hardy and\r\n  ubiquitous sunflower has been chosen as the state flower or floral\r\n  emblem. Cactus and yucca occur in the west.\r\n\r\n  The soil of the upland prairies is generally a deep rich clay loam of\r\n  a dark colour. The bottom lands near the streams are a black sandy\r\n  loam; and the intermediate lands, or \"second bottoms,\" show a rich and\r\n  deep black loam, containing very little sand. These soils are all\r\n  easily cultivated, free from stones, and exceedingly productive. There\r\n  are exceptional spots on the upland prairies composed of stiff clay,\r\n  not as easily cultivated, but very productive when properly managed\r\n  and enriched. The south-west section is distinctively sandy.\r\n\r\n  _Agriculture._--The United States Census of 1900 shows that of the\r\n  farming area of the state in 1900 (41,662,970 acres, 79.6% of the\r\n  total area), 60.1% was \"improved.\" The value of all farm property was\r\n  $864,100,286--of which land and improvements (including buildings),\r\n  livestock and implements and machinery represented respectively 74.5,\r\n  22.1 and 3.4%. Almost nine-tenths of all farms derived their principal\r\n  income from livestock or hay and grain, these two sources being about\r\n  equally important. Of the total value of farm products in 1899\r\n  ($209,895,542), crops represented 53.7, animal products 45.9 and\r\n  forest products only 0.4%. In 1899 the wheat crop was 38,778,450\r\n  bushels, being less than that of Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio or\r\n  South Dakota. According to the _Year Book_ of the United States\r\n  Department of Agriculture, the crop in 1906 was 81,830,611 bushels,\r\n  almost one-ninth of the crop of the entire country for that year, and\r\n  much more than the crop of any other state. In 1909 it was 87,203,000\r\n  bushels (less than the crops of either Minnesota or North Dakota).\r\n  Winter wheat constitutes almost the entire output. The hard varieties\r\n  rank in the flour market with the finest Minnesota wheat. The wheat\r\n  belt crosses the state from north to south in its central third.\r\n  Greater even than wheat in absolute output, though not relatively to\r\n  the output of other states, is Indian corn. In 1906 the crop was\r\n  195,075,000 bushels, and in 1909 it was 154,225,000. The crop is very\r\n  variable, according to seasons and prospective markets; ranging e.g.\r\n  in the decade 1892-1901 from 42.6 (1901) to 225.1 (1899) million\r\n  bushels. The Indian corn belt is mainly in the eastern third of the\r\n  state. In the five years 1896-1900 the combined value of the crops of\r\n  Indian corn and wheat exceeded the value of the same crops in any\r\n  other state of the Union (Illinois being a close second). In the\r\n  western third irrigation has been tried, in the earlier years\r\n  unsuccessfully; in all Kansas, in 1899, there were 23,620 acres\r\n  irrigated, of which 8939 were in Finney and 7071 in Kearney county. In\r\n  this western third the rainfall is insufficient for Indian corn; but\r\n  Kafir corn, an exceptional drought-resisting cereal, has made\r\n  extraordinary progress in this region, and indeed generally over the\r\n  state, since 1893, its acreage increasing 416.1% in the decade\r\n  1895-1904. With the saccharine variety of sorghum, which increased\r\n  greatly in the same period, this grain is replacing Indian corn. Oats\r\n  are the third great cereal crop, the yield being 24,780,000 bushels in\r\n  1906 and 27,185,000 in 1909. Alfalfa showed an increased acreage in\r\n  1895-1904 of 310.8%; it is valuable in the west for the same qualities\r\n  as the Kafir corn. The hay crop in 1909 was 2,652,000 tons. Alfalfa,\r\n  the Japanese soy bean and the wheat fields--which furnish the finest\r\n  of pasture in the early spring and ordinarily well into the winter\r\n  season--are the props of a prosperous dairy industry. In the early\r\n  'eighties the organization of creameries and cheese factories began in\r\n  the county-seats; they depended upon gathered cream. About 1889\r\n  separators and the whole-milk system were introduced, and about the\r\n  same time began the service of refrigerator cars on the railways; the\r\n  hand separator became common about 1901. Western Kansas is the dairy\r\n  country. Its great ranges, whose insufficient rainfall makes\r\n  impossible the certain, and therefore the profitable, cultivation of\r\n  cereals, or other settled agriculture, lend themselves with profit to\r\n  stock and dairy farming. Dairy products increased 60.6% in value from\r\n  1895 to 1904, amounting in the latter year to $16,420,095. This value\r\n  was almost equalled by that of eggs and poultry ($14,050,727), which\r\n  increased 79.7% in the same decade. The livestock interest is\r\n  stimulated by the enormous demand for beef-cattle at Kansas City.\r\n\r\n  Sugar-beet culture was tried in the years following 1890 with\r\n  indifferent success until the introduction of bounties in 1901. It has\r\n  extended along the Arkansas valley from the Colorado beet district and\r\n  into the north-western counties. There is a large beet-sugar factory\r\n  at Garden City, Finney county. Experiments have been made\r\n  unsuccessfully in sugar cane (1885) and silk culture (1885 seq.). The\r\n  bright climate and pure atmosphere are admirably adapted to the growth\r\n  of the apple, pear, peach, plum, grape and cherry. The smaller fruits\r\n  also, with scarce an exception, flourish finely. The fruit product of\r\n  Kansas ($2,431,773 in 1899) is not, however, as yet particularly\r\n  notable when compared with that of various other states.\r\n\r\n  According to the estimates of the state department of agriculture, of\r\n  the total value of all agricultural products in the twenty years\r\n  1885-1904 ($3,078,999,855), Indian corn and wheat together represented\r\n  more than two-fifths (821.3 and 518.1 million dollars respectively),\r\n  and livestock products nearly one-third (1024.9 millions). The\r\n  aggregate value of all agricultural products in 1903-1904 was\r\n  $754,954,208.\r\n\r\n  _Minerals._--In the east portion of the state are immense beds of\r\n  bituminous coal, often at shallow depths or cropping out on the\r\n  surface. In 1907 more than 95% of the coal came from Crawford,\r\n  Cherokee, Leavenworth and Osage counties, and about 91.5% from the\r\n  first two. The total value of the production of coal in 1905\r\n  (6,423,979 tons) was $9,350,542, and in 1908 (6,245,508 tons)\r\n  $9,292,222. In the central portion, which belongs to the Triassic\r\n  formation, magnesian limestone, ferruginous sandstone and gypsum are\r\n  representative rocks. Gypsum (in beautiful crystalline form) is found\r\n  in an almost continuous bed across the state running north-east and\r\n  south-west with three principal areas, the northern in Marshall\r\n  county, the central in Dickinson and Saline counties, and the southern\r\n  (the heaviest, being 3 to 40 ft. thick) in Barber and Comanche\r\n  counties. The product in 1908 was valued at $281,339. Magnesian\r\n  limestone, or dolomite, is especially plentiful along the Blue,\r\n  Republican and Neosho rivers and their tributaries. This beautiful\r\n  stone, resembling white, grey and cream-coloured marble, is\r\n  exceedingly useful for building purposes. It crops out in the bluffs\r\n  in endless quantities, and is easily worked. The stone resources of\r\n  the state are largely, but by no means exclusively, confined to the\r\n  central part. There are marbles in Osage and other counties, shell\r\n  marble in Montgomery county, white limestone in Chase county, a\r\n  valuable bandera flagstone and hydraulic cement rock near Fort Scott,\r\n  &c. The limestones produced in 1908 were valued at $403,176 and the\r\n  sandstones at $67,950. In the central region salt is produced in\r\n  immense quantities, within a great north to south belt about\r\n  Hutchinson. The beds, which are exploited by the brine method at\r\n  Hutchinson, at Ellsworth (Ellsworth county), at Anthony (Harper\r\n  county) and at Sterling (Rice county), lie from 400 to 1200 ft.\r\n  underground, and are in places as much as 350 ft. thick and 99% pure.\r\n  At Kanopolis in Ellsworth county, at Lyons in Rice county and at\r\n  Kingman, Kingman county, the salt is mined and sold as rock-salt. In\r\n  the south-west salt is found in beds and dry incrustations, varying in\r\n  thickness from a few inches to 2 ft. The total product from 1880-1899\r\n  was valued at $5,538,855; the product of 1908 (when Kansas ranked\r\n  fourth among the states producing salt) was valued at $882,984. The\r\n  development has been mainly since 1887 at Hutchinson and since about\r\n  1890 in the rock-salt mines. In the west portion of the state, which\r\n  belongs to the Cretaceous formation, chalks and a species of native\r\n  quicklime are very prominent in the river bluffs. The white and\r\n  cream-coloured chalks are much used for building purposes, but the\r\n  blue is usually too soft for exposure to the weather. The quicklime as\r\n  quarried from the bluffs slakes perfectly, and with sand makes a\r\n  fairly good mortar, without calcination or other previous preparation.\r\n  The lignite found near the Colorado line makes a valuable domestic\r\n  fuel.\r\n\r\n  Natural gas, oil, zinc and lead have been discovered in south-east\r\n  Kansas and have given that section an extraordinary growth and\r\n  prosperity. Indications of gas were found about the time of the Civil\r\n  War, but only in the early 'seventies were they recognized as\r\n  unmistakable, and they were not successfully developed until the\r\n  'eighties. Iola, in Allen county, is the centre of the field, and the\r\n  gas yields heat, light, and a cheap fuel for smelters, cement-works\r\n  and other manufacturing plants throughout a large region. The pools\r\n  lie from 400 to 950 ft. below the surface; some wells have been\r\n  drilled 1500 ft. deep. The value of the natural gas produced in the\r\n  state was $15,873 in 1889, $2,261,836 in 1905 and $7,691,587 in 1908,\r\n  when there were 1917 producing wells, and Kansas ranked fourth of the\r\n  states of the United States in the value of the natural gas product,\r\n  being surpassed by Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Petroleum was\r\n  discovered about 1865 in Miami and Bourbon counties, and about 1892 at\r\n  Neodesha, Wilson county. There was only slight commercial exploitation\r\n  before 1900. The production increased from 74,714 barrels in that year\r\n  to 4,250,779 in 1904; in 1908 it was 1,801,781 barrels. Chanute has\r\n  been the most active centre of production. The field was prospected\r\n  here in the 'nineties, but developed only after 1900. In 1877 an\r\n  immense deposit of lead was discovered on land now within the limits\r\n  of Galena. Rich zinc blendes were at first thrown away among the\r\n  by-products of the lead mines. After the discovery of their true\r\n  nature there was a slow development, and at the end of the century a\r\n  notable boom in the fields. From 1876 to 1897 the total value of the\r\n  output of the Galena field was between $25,000,000 and $26,000,000;\r\n  but at present Kansas is far more important as a smelter than as a\r\n  miner of zinc and lead, and in 1906 58% of all spelter produced in the\r\n  United States came from smelters in Kansas. In 1908 the mines' output\r\n  was 2293 tons of lead valued at $192,612 and 8628 tons of zinc valued\r\n  at $811,032. Pottery, fire, ochre and brick clays are abundant, the\r\n  first two mainly in the eastern part of the state. Coffeyville has\r\n  large vitrified brick interests. In 1908 the total value of all the\r\n  mineral products (incompletely reported) of Kansas was $26,162,213.\r\n\r\n  _Industry and Trade._--Manufactures are not characteristic of the\r\n  state. The rank of the state in manufactures in 1900 was sixteenth and\r\n  in farm products seventh in the Union. The value of the manufactured\r\n  product in 1900, according to the Twelfth United States Census, was\r\n  $172,129,398, an increase of 56.2% over the output of 1890; of this\r\n  total value, the part representing establishments under the \"factory\r\n  system\" was $154,008,544,[2] and in 1905 the value of the factory\r\n  product was $198,244,992, an increase of 28.7%. Kansas City, Topeka,\r\n  Wichita, Leavenworth and Atchison were the only cities which had\r\n  manufactures whose gross product was valued in 1905 at more than\r\n  $3,000,000 each; their joint product was valued at $126,515,804, and\r\n  that of Kansas City alone was $96,473,050, almost half the output of\r\n  the state. The most important manufacturing industry, both in 1900 and\r\n  in 1905, was slaughtering and meat-packing--for which Kansas City is\r\n  the second centre of the country--with a product for the state valued\r\n  at $77,411,883 in 1900, and $96,375,639 in 1905; in both these years\r\n  the value of the product of Kansas was exceeded only by that of\r\n  Illinois. The flour and grist mill industry ranked next, with a\r\n  product valued at $21,328,747 in 1900 and nearly twice that amount,\r\n  $42,034,019, in 1905. In 1900 a quarter of the wheat crop was handled\r\n  by the mills of the state. Lesser manufacturing interests are railway\r\n  shop construction (value in 1905, $11,521,144); zinc smelting and\r\n  refining (value in 1905, $10,999,468); the manufacture of cheese,\r\n  butter and condensed milk (value in 1905, $3,946,349); and of foundry\r\n  and machine shop products (value in 1905, $3,756,825).\r\n\r\n  _Communications._--Kansas is excellently provided with railways, with\r\n  an aggregate length in January 1909 of 8914.77 m. (in 1870, 1880, 1890\r\n  respectively, 1,501, 3,244 and 8,710 m.). The most important systems\r\n  are the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, the Missouri Pacific, the\r\n  Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific, the Union Pacific, the Missouri,\r\n  Kansas & Texas, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, and the St Louis &\r\n  San Francisco systems. The first train entered Kansas on the Union\r\n  Pacific in 1860. During the following decade the lines of the Missouri\r\n  Pacific, the Missouri, Kansas & Texas and the Santa Fe were well under\r\n  construction. These roads give excellent connexions with Chicago, the\r\n  Gulf and the Pacific. Kansas has an eastern river front of 150 m. on\r\n  the Missouri, which is navigable for steamboats of good size. The\r\n  internal rivers of the state are not utilized for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n_Population._--In population Kansas ranked in 1900 and 1910 (1,690,949)\r\ntwenty-second in the Union. The decennial increases of population from\r\n1860 to 1900 were 239.9, 173.4, 43.3 and 3.0%, the population in 1900\r\nbeing 1,470,495, or 18 to the sq. m.[3] Of this number 22.5% lived in\r\ncities of 2500 or more inhabitants. Nine cities numbered more than\r\n10,000 inhabitants: Kansas City (51,418), Topeka--the state capital\r\n(33,608), Wichita (24,671), Leavenworth (20,735), Atchison (15,722),\r\nLawrence--the seat of the state university (10,862), Fort Scott\r\n(10,322), Galena (10,155) and Pittsburg (10,112). The life of all of\r\nthese save the last two goes back to Territorial days; but the\r\nimportance of Fort Scott, like that of Galena and Pittsburg, is due to\r\nthe development of the mineral counties in the south-east. Other cities\r\nof above 5000 inhabitants were Hutchinson (9379), Emporia (8223),\r\nParsons (7682), Ottawa (6934), Newton (6208), Arkansas City (6140),\r\nSalina (6074), Argentine (5878) and Iola (5791). The number of negroes\r\n(3.5%) is somewhat large for a northern and western state. This is\r\nlargely owing to an exodus of coloured people from the South in\r\n1878-1880, at a time when their condition was an unusually hard one: an\r\nexodus turned mainly toward Kansas. The population is very largely\r\nAmerican-born (91.4% in 1900; 47.1% being natives of Kansas). Germans,\r\nBritish, Scandinavians and Russians constitute the bulk of the\r\nforeign-born. The west third of the state is comparatively scantily\r\npopulated, owing to its aridity. In the 'seventies, after a succession\r\nof wet seasons, and again in the 'eighties, settlement was pushed far\r\nwestward, beyond the limits of safe agriculture, but hundreds of\r\nsettlers--and indeed many entire communities--were literally starved out\r\nby the recurrence of droughts. Irrigation has made a surer future for\r\nlimited areas, however, and the introduction of drought-resisting crops\r\nand the substitution of dairy and livestock interests in the place of\r\nagriculture have brightened the outlook in the western counties, whose\r\npopulation increased rapidly after 1900. The early 'eighties were made\r\nnotable by a tremendous \"boom\" in real estate, rural and urban,\r\nthroughout the commonwealth. As regards the distribution of religious\r\nsects, in 1906 there were 458,190 communicants of all denominations, and\r\nof this number 121,208 were Methodists (108,097 being Methodist\r\nEpiscopalians of the Northern Church), 93,195 were Roman Catholics,\r\n46,299 were Baptists (34,975 being members of the Northern Baptist\r\nConvention and 10,011 of the National (Colored) Baptist Convention),\r\n40,765 were Presbyterians (33,465 being members of the Northern Church)\r\nand 40,356 were Disciples of Christ. The German-Russian Mennonites,\r\nwhose immigration became notable about 1874, furnished at first many\r\nexamples of communal economy, but these were later abandoned. In 1906\r\nthe total number of Mennonites was 7445, of whom 3581 were members of\r\nthe General Conference of Mennonites of North America, 1825 belonged to\r\nthe Schellenberger Bruder-gemeinde, and the others were distributed\r\namong seven other sects.\r\n\r\n_Government._--The constitution is that adopted at Wyandotte on the 29th\r\nof July 1859 and ratified by the people on the 4th of October 1859; it\r\ncame into operation on the 29th of January 1861, and was amended in\r\n1861, 1864, 1867, 1873, 1875, 1876, 1880, 1888, 1900, 1902, 1904 and\r\n1906. An amendment may be proposed by either branch of the legislature,\r\nand, if approved by two-thirds of the members elected to each house as\r\nwell as by a majority of the electors voting on it at a general\r\nelection, it is adopted. A constitutional convention to revise or amend\r\nthe constitution may be called in the same manner. Universal manhood\r\nsuffrage is the rule, but women may vote in school and municipal\r\nelections, Kansas being the first state to grant women municipal\r\nsuffrage as well as the right to hold municipal offices (1887). General\r\nelections to state, county and township offices are biennial, in\r\neven-numbered years, and take place on the first Tuesday after the first\r\nMonday in November. The state executive officers are a governor,\r\nlieutenant-governor, secretary of state, auditor, treasurer,\r\nattorney-general and superintendent of public instruction, all elected\r\nfor a term of two years. The governor appoints, with the approval of the\r\nSenate, a board of public works and some other administrative boards,\r\nand he may veto any bill from the legislature, which cannot thereafter\r\nbecome a law unless again approved by two-thirds of the members elected\r\nto each house.\r\n\r\nThe legislature, consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives,\r\nmeets in regular session at Topeka, the capital, on the second Tuesday\r\nof January in odd-numbered years. The membership of the senate is\r\nlimited to 40, and that of the house of representatives to 125. Senators\r\nare elected for four years and representatives for two years. In regular\r\nsessions not exceeding fifty days and in special sessions not exceeding\r\nthirty days the members of both houses are paid three dollars a day\r\nbesides an allowance for travelling expenses, but they receive no\r\ncompensation for the extra time of longer sessions. In 1908 a direct\r\nprimary law was passed applicable to all nominations except for\r\npresidential electors, school district officers and officers in cities\r\nof less than 5000 inhabitants; like public elections the primaries are\r\nmade a public charge; nomination is by petition signed by a certain\r\npercentage (for state office, at least 1%; for district office, at least\r\n2%; for sub-district or county office, at least 3%) of the party vote;\r\nthe direct nominating system applies to the candidates for the United\r\nStates Senate, the nominee chosen by the direct primaries of each party\r\nbeing the nominee of the party.\r\n\r\n  The judicial power is vested in one supreme court, thirty-eight\r\n  district courts, one probate court for each county, and two or more\r\n  justices of the peace for each township. All justices are elected:\r\n  those of the supreme court, seven in number, for six years, two or\r\n  three every two years; those of the district courts for four years;\r\n  and those of the probate courts and the justices of the peace for two\r\n  years. The more important affairs of each county are managed by a\r\n  board of commissioners, who are elected by districts for four years,\r\n  but each county elects also a clerk, a treasurer, a probate judge, a\r\n  register of deeds, a sheriff, a coroner, an attorney, a clerk of the\r\n  district court, and a surveyor, and the district court for the county\r\n  appoints a county auditor. The township officers, all elected for two\r\n  years, are a trustee, a clerk, a treasurer, two or more justices of\r\n  the peace, two constables and one road overseer for each road\r\n  district. Cities are governed under a general law, but by this law\r\n  they are divided into three classes according to size, and the\r\n  government is different for each class. Those having a population of\r\n  more than 15,000 constitute the first class, those having a population\r\n  of more than 2000 but not more than 15,000 constitute the second\r\n  class, and those having a population not exceeding 2000 constitute the\r\n  third class. Municipal elections are far removed from those of the\r\n  state, being held in odd-numbered years in April. In cities of the\r\n  first class the state law requires the election of a mayor, city\r\n  clerk, city treasurer, police judge and councilmen; in those of the\r\n  second class it requires the election of a mayor, police judge, city\r\n  treasurer, councilmen, board of education, justices of the peace and\r\n  constables; and in those of the third class it requires the election\r\n  of a mayor, police judge and councilmen. Several other offices\r\n  provided for in each class are filled by the appointment of the mayor.\r\n\r\n  The principal grounds for a divorce in Kansas are adultery, extreme\r\n  cruelty, habitual drunkenness, abandonment for one year, gross neglect\r\n  of duty, and imprisonment in the penitentiary as a felon subsequent to\r\n  marriage, but the applicant for a divorce must have resided in the\r\n  state the entire year preceding the presentment of the petition. A\r\n  married woman has the same rights to her property after marriage as\r\n  before marriage, except that she is not permitted to bequeath away\r\n  from her husband more than one-half of it without his written consent,\r\n  and no will made by the husband can affect the right of the wife, if\r\n  she survive him, to one-half of the property of which he died seized.\r\n  Whenever a husband dies intestate, leaving a farm or a house and lot\r\n  in a town or city which was the residence of the family at his death,\r\n  his widow, widow and children, or children alone if there be no widow,\r\n  may hold the same as a homestead to the extent of 160 acres if it be a\r\n  farm, or one acre if it be a town or city lot. A homestead of this\r\n  size is exempt from levy for the debts of the intestate except in case\r\n  of an incumbrance given by consent of both husband and wife, or of\r\n  obligations for purchase money, or of liens for making improvements,\r\n  and the homestead of a family cannot be alienated without the joint\r\n  consent of husband and wife. The homestead status ceases, however,\r\n  whenever the widow marries again or when all the children arrive at\r\n  the age of majority. An eight-hour labour law was passed in 1891 and\r\n  was upheld by the state supreme court. In 1909 a law was passed for\r\n  state regulation of fire insurance rates (except in the case of\r\n  farmers' mutuals insuring farm property only) and forbidding local\r\n  discrimination of rates within the state. In the same year a law was\r\n  passed requiring that any corporation acting as a common carrier in\r\n  the state must receive the permission of the state board of railway\r\n  commissioners for the issue of stocks, bonds or other evidences of\r\n  indebtedness.\r\n\r\n  The manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors except for medical,\r\n  scientific and mechanical purposes were prohibited by a constitutional\r\n  amendment adopted in 1880. The Murray liquor law of 1881, providing\r\n  for the enforcement of the amendment, was declared constitutional by\r\n  the state supreme court in 1883. At many sessions of the legislature\r\n  its enemies vainly attempted its repeal. It was more seriously\r\n  threatened in 1890 by the \"Original Package Decision,\" of the United\r\n  States Supreme Court, the decision, namely, that the state law could\r\n  not apply to liquor introduced into Kansas from another state and sold\r\n  from the original package, such inter-state commerce being within the\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction of Congress. That body thereupon gave Kansas\r\n  the power needed, and its action was upheld by the Federal Supreme\r\n  Court. The enforcement of the law has varied, however, enormously\r\n  according to the locality. In 1906-1907 a fresh crusade to enforce the\r\n  law was begun by the attorney-general, who brought ouster suits\r\n  against the mayors of Wichita, Junction City, Pittsburg and\r\n  Leavenworth for not enforcing the law and for replacing it with the\r\n  \"fine\" system, which was merely an irregular licence. In 1907 the\r\n  attorney-general's office turned its attention to outside brewing\r\n  companies doing business in the state and secured injunctions against\r\n  such breweries doing business in the state and the appointment of\r\n  receivers of their property. The provision of the law permitting the\r\n  sale of whisky for medicinal, scientific or mechanical purposes was\r\n  repealed by a law of 1909 prohibiting the sale, manufacture or barter\r\n  of spirituous, malt, vinous or any other intoxicating liquors within\r\n  the state. The severity of this law was ascribed to efforts of the\r\n  liquor interests to render it objectionable.\r\n\r\n  The constitution forbids the contraction of a state debt exceeding\r\n  $1,000,000. The actual debt on the 30th of June 1908 was $605,000,\r\n  which was a permanent school fund. Taxation is on the general-property\r\n  system. The entire system has been--as in other states where it\r\n  prevails--extremely irregular and arbitrary as regards local\r\n  assessments, and very imperfect; and the figures of total valuation\r\n  (in 1880 $160,570,761, in 1890 $347,717,218, in 1906 $408,329,749, and\r\n  in 1908, when it was supposed to be the actual valuation of all\r\n  taxable property, $2,453,691,859), though significant of taxation\r\n  methods, are not significant of the general condition or progress of\r\n  the state.\r\n\r\n  _Education._--Of higher educational institutions, the state supports\r\n  the university of Kansas at Lawrence (1866), an agricultural college\r\n  at Manhattan (1863; aided by the United States government); a normal\r\n  school at Emporia (1865), a western branch of the same at Hays (1902);\r\n  a manual training normal school (1903) at Pittsburg, western\r\n  university (Quindaro) for negroes and the Topeka industrial and\r\n  educational institute (1896, reorganized on the plan of Tuskegee\r\n  institute in 1900) also for negroes. The university of Kansas was\r\n  organized in 1864 and opened in 1866. Its engineering department was\r\n  established in 1870, its normal department in 1876 (abolished 1885),\r\n  its department of music in 1877, its department of law in 1878, and\r\n  the department of pharmacy in 1885; in 1891 the preparatory department\r\n  was abolished and the university was reorganized with \"schools\" in\r\n  place of the former \"departments.\" In 1899 a school of medicine was\r\n  established, in connexion with which the Eleanor Taylor Bell memorial\r\n  hospital was erected in 1905. In 1907-1908 the university had a\r\n  faculty of 211, an enrolment of 2063 (1361 men and 702 women); the\r\n  university library contained 60,000 volumes and 37,000 pamphlets. An\r\n  efficient compulsory education law was passed in 1903. Kansas ranks\r\n  very high among the states in its small percentage of illiteracy\r\n  (inability to write)--in 1900 only 2.9% of persons at least ten years\r\n  of age; the figures for native whites, foreign whites and negroes\r\n  being respectively 1.3, 8.5, 22.3. In addition to the state schools,\r\n  various flourishing private or denominational institutions are\r\n  maintained. The largest of these are the Kansas Wesleyan University\r\n  (Methodist Episcopal, 1886) at Salina and Baker University (Methodist\r\n  Episcopal, 1858) at Baldwin. Among the many smaller colleges are\r\n  Washburn College (Congregational, 1869) at Topeka, the South-west\r\n  Kansas College (Methodist Episcopal, opened 1886) at Winfield, the\r\n  College of Emporia (Presbyterian, 1883) at Emporia, Bethany College\r\n  (Lutheran, 1881) at Lindsborg, Fairmount College (non-sectarian, 1895)\r\n  at Wichita, St Mary's College (Roman Catholic, 1869) at St Mary's, and\r\n  Ottawa University (Baptist, 1865) at Ottawa. At Topeka is the College\r\n  of the Sisters of Bethany (Protestant Episcopal, 1861) for women.\r\n  There are also various small professional schools and private normal\r\n  schools. An industrial school for Indian children is maintained by the\r\n  United States near Lawrence (Haskell Institute, 1884). Among the state\r\n  charitable and reformatory institutions are state hospitals for the\r\n  insane at Topeka and Osawatomie and a hospital for epileptics at\r\n  Parsons; industrial reform schools for girls at Beloit, for boys at\r\n  Topeka, and for criminals under twenty-five at Hutchinson; a\r\n  penitentiary at Lansing; a soldiers' orphans' home at Atchison and a\r\n  soldiers' home at Dodge City; and schools for feeble-minded youth at\r\n  Winfield, for the deaf at Olathe, and for the blind at Kansas City.\r\n  These institutions are under the supervision of a state board of\r\n  control. The state contributes also to many institutions on a private\r\n  basis. Most of the counties maintain poor farms and administer outdoor\r\n  relief, and some care for insane patients at the cost of the state.\r\n\r\n_History._--The territory now included in Kansas was first visited by\r\nEuropeans in 1541, when Francisco de Coronado led his Spaniards from New\r\nMexico across the buffalo plains in search of the wealth of \"Quivira,\" a\r\nregion located by Bandelier and other authorities in Kansas north-east\r\nof the Great Bend of the Arkansas. Thereafter, save for a brief French\r\noccupation, 1719-1725, and possibly slight explorations equally\r\ninconsequential, Kansas remained in undisturbed possession of the\r\nIndians until in 1803 it passed to the United States (all save the part\r\nwest of 100 deg. long. and south of the Arkansas river) as part of the\r\nLouisiana Purchase. The explorations for the United States of Z. M. Pike\r\n(1807) and S. H. Long (1819) tended to confirm old ideas of sandy wastes\r\nwest of the Mississippi. But with the establishment of prairie commerce\r\nto Santa Fe (New Mexico), the waves of emigration to the Mormon land and\r\nto California, the growth of traffic to Salt Lake, and the explorations\r\nfor a transcontinental railway, Kansas became well known, and was taken\r\nout of that mythical \"Great American Desert,\" in which, thanks\r\nespecially to Pike and to Washington Irving, it had been supposed to\r\nlie. The trade with Santa Fe began about 1804, although regular caravans\r\nwere begun only about 1825. This trade is one of the most picturesque\r\nchapters in border history, and picturesque in retrospect, too, is the\r\narmy of emigrants crossing the continent in \"prairie schooners\" to\r\nCalifornia or Utah, of whom almost all went through Kansas.\r\n\r\nBut this movement of hunters, trappers, traders, Mormons, miners and\r\nhomeseekers left nothing to show of settlement in Kansas, for which,\r\ntherefore, the succession of Territorial governments organized for the\r\nnorthern portion of the Louisiana Purchase had no real significance.\r\nBefore 1854 Kansas was an Indian land, although on its Indian\r\nreservations (created in its east part for eastern tribes removed\r\nthither after 1830) some few whites resided: missionaries, blacksmiths,\r\nagents, farmers supposed to teach the Indians agriculture, and land\r\n\"squatters,\"--possibly 800 in all. Fort Leavenworth was established in\r\n1827, Fort Scott in 1842, Fort Riley in 1853. There were Methodist\r\n(1829), Baptist, Quaker, Catholic and Presbyterian missions active by\r\n1837. Importunities to Congress to institute a Territorial government\r\nbegan in 1852. This was realized by the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854.\r\n\r\nBy that Act Kansas (which from 1854 to 1861 included a large part of\r\nColorado) became, for almost a decade, the storm centre of national\r\npolitical passion, and her history of prime significance in the\r\nunfolding prologue of the Civil War. Despite the Missouri Compromise,\r\nwhich had prohibited slavery in the Louisiana Purchase N. of 36 deg. 30'\r\nN. lat. (except in Missouri), slaves were living at the missions and\r\nelsewhere, among Indians and whites, in 1854. The \"popular sovereignty\"\r\nprinciple of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill involved a sectional struggle for\r\nthe new Territory. Time showed that the winning of Kansas was a question\r\nof the lightest-footed immigrant. Slaveholders were not footloose; they\r\nhad all to lose if they should carry their blacks into Kansas and should\r\nnevertheless fail to make it a slave-state. Thus the South had to\r\nestablish slavery by other than actual slaveholders, unless Missouri\r\nshould act for her to establish it. But Missouri did not move her\r\nslaves; while her vicinity encouraged border partisans to seek such\r\nestablishment even without residence--by intimidation, election frauds\r\nand outrage. This determined at once the nature of the Kansas struggle\r\nand its outcome; and after the South had played and lost in Kansas, \"the\r\nwar for the Union caught up and nationalized the verdict of the\r\nTerritorial broil.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1854 Missouri \"squatters\" began to post claims to\r\nborder lands and warn away intending anti-slavery settlers. The\r\nimmigration of these from the North was fostered in every way, notably\r\nthrough the New England Emigrant Aid Company (see LAWRENCE, A. A.),\r\nwhose example was widely imitated. Little organized effort was made in\r\nthe South to settle the Territory; Lawrence (Wakarusa) and Topeka,\r\nfree-state centres, and Leavenworth, Lecompton and Atchison, pro-slavery\r\ntowns, were among those settled in 1854.\r\n\r\nAt the first election (Nov. 1854), held for a delegate to Congress, some\r\n1700 armed Missourians invaded Kansas and stuffed the ballot boxes; and\r\nthis intimidation and fraud was practised on a much larger scale in the\r\nelection of a Territorial legislature in March 1855. The resultant\r\nlegislature (at Pawnee, later at Shawnee Mission) adopted the laws of\r\nMissouri almost _en bloc_, made it a felony to utter a word against\r\nslavery, made extreme pro-slavery views a qualification for office,\r\ndeclared death the penalty for aiding a slave to escape, and in general\r\nrepudiated liberty for its opponents. The radical free-state men\r\nthereupon began the importation of rifles. All criticism of this is\r\ninconsequent; \"fighting gear\" was notoriously the only effective asset\r\nof Missourians in Kansas, every Southern band in Kansas was militarily\r\norganized and armed, and the free-state men armed only under necessity.\r\nFurthermore, a free-state \"government\" was set up, the \"bogus\"\r\nlegislature at Shawnee being \"repudiated.\" Perfecting their organization\r\nin a series of popular conventions, they adopted (Dec. 1855) the Topeka\r\nConstitution--which declared the exclusion of negroes from\r\nKansas--elected state officials, and sent a contestant delegate to\r\nCongress. The Topeka \"government\" was simply a craftily impressive\r\norganization, a standing protest. It met now and then, and directed\r\nsentiment, being twice dispersed by United States troops; but it passed\r\nno laws, and did nothing that conflicted with the Territorial government\r\ncountenanced by Congress. On the other hand, the laws of the \"bogus\"\r\nlegislature were generally ignored by the free-state partisans, except\r\nin cases (e.g. the service of a writ) where that was impossible without\r\napparent actual rebellion against the authority of the legislature, and\r\ntherefore of Congress.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the \"border war\" began. During the (almost bloodless)\r\n\"Wakarusa War\" Lawrence was threatened by an armed force from Missouri,\r\nbut was saved by the intervention of Governor Shannon. Up to this time\r\nthe initiative and the bulk of outrages lay assuredly heavily on the\r\npro-slavery side; hereafter they became increasingly common and more\r\nevenly divided. In May 1856 another Missouri force entered Lawrence\r\nwithout resistance, destroyed its printing offices, wrecked buildings\r\nand pillaged generally. This was the day before the assault on Charles\r\nSumner (q.v.) in the Senate of the United States. These two outrages\r\nfired Northern passion and determination. In Kansas they were a stimulus\r\nto the most radical elements. Immediately after the sack of Lawrence,\r\nJohn Brown and a small band murdered and mutilated five pro-slavery men,\r\non Pottawatomie Creek; a horrible deed, showing a new spirit on the\r\nfree-state side, and of ghastly consequence--for it contributed\r\npowerfully to widen further the licence of highway robbery, pillage and\r\narson, the ruin of homes, the driving off of settlers, marauding\r\nexpeditions, attacks on towns, outrages in short of every kind, that\r\nmade the following months a welter of lawlessness and crime, until\r\nGovernor Geary--by putting himself above all partisanship, repudiating\r\nMissouri, and using Federal troops--put an end to them late in 1856.\r\n(In the isolated south-eastern counties they continued through\r\n1856-1858, mainly to the advantage of the \"jay-hawkers\" of free-state\r\nKansas and to the terror of Missouri.)\r\n\r\nThe struggle now passed into another phase, in which questions of state\r\npredominate. But something may be remarked in passing of the leaders in\r\nthe period of turbulence. John Brown wished to deal a blow against\r\nslavery, but did nothing to aid any conservative political organization\r\nto that end. James H. Lane was another radical, and always favoured\r\nforce. He was a political adventurer, an enthusiastic, energetic,\r\nambitious, ill-balanced man, shrewd and magnetic. He assuredly did much\r\nfor the free-state cause; meek politics were not alone sufficient in\r\nthose years in Kansas. The leader of the conservative free-soilers was\r\nCharles Robinson (1818-1894). He was born in Massachusetts, studied\r\nmedicine at the Berkshire Medical School, and had had political\r\nexperience in California, whither he had gone in 1849, and where in\r\n1850-1852 he was a member of the legislature and a successful\r\nanti-slavery leader. In 1854 he had come to Kansas as an agent of the\r\nEmigrant Aid Company. He was the author of the Topeka government idea,\r\nor at least was its moving spirit, serving throughout as the \"governor\"\r\nunder it; though averse to force, he would use it if necessary, and was\r\nfirst in command in the \"Wakarusa War.\" His partisans say that he saved\r\nKansas, and regard Lane as a fomenter of trouble who accomplished\r\nnothing. Andrew H. Reeder (1807-1864), who showed himself a pro-slavery\r\nsympathizer as first Territorial governor, was removed from office for\r\nfavouring the free-state party; he became a leader in the free-state\r\ncause. Every governor who followed him was forced by the logic of events\r\nand truth tacitly to acknowledge that right lay with the free-state\r\nparty. Reeder and Shannon fled the Territory in fear of assassination by\r\nthe pro-slavery party, with which at first they had had most sympathy.\r\nAmong the pro-slavery leaders David Rice Atchison (1807-1886), United\r\nStates Senator in 1843-1855, accompanied both expeditions against\r\nLawrence; but he urged moderation, as always, at the end of what was a\r\nlegitimate result of his radical agitation.\r\n\r\nIn June 1857 delegates were elected to a constitutional convention. The\r\nelection Act did not provide for any popular vote upon the constitution\r\nthey should form, and was passed over Governor John W. Geary's veto. A\r\ncensus, miserably deficient (largely owing to free-state abstention and\r\nobstruction), was the basis of apportionment of delegates. The\r\nfree-state party demanded a popular vote on the constitution. On the\r\njustice of this Governor Robert J. Walker and President Buchanan were at\r\nfirst unequivocally agreed, and the governor promised fairplay.\r\nNevertheless only pro-slavery men voted, and the convention was thus\r\npro-slavery. The document it framed is known as the Lecompton\r\nConstitution. Before the convention met, the free-state party,\r\nabandoning its policy of political inaction, captured the Territorial\r\nlegislature. On the constitutional convention rested, then, all hope of\r\nsaving Kansas for slavery; and that would be impossible if they should\r\nsubmit their handiwork to the people. The convention declared slave\r\nproperty to be \"before and higher than any constitutional sanction\" and\r\nforbade amendments affecting it; but it provided for a popular vote on\r\nthe alternatives, the \"constitution with slavery\" or the \"constitution\r\nwith no slavery.\" If the latter should be adopted, slavery should cease\r\n\"except\" that the right to property in slaves in the Territory should\r\nnot be interfered with. The free-state men regarded this as including\r\nthe right to property in offspring of slaves, and therefore as pure\r\nfraud. Governor Walker stood firmly against this iniquitous scheme; he\r\nsaw that slavery was, otherwise, doomed, but he thought Kansas could be\r\nsaved to the Democratic party though lost to slavery. But President\r\nBuchanan, under Southern influence, repudiated his former assurances.\r\nThere is reason to believe that the whole scheme was originated at\r\nWashington, and though Buchanan was not privy to it before the event,\r\nyet he adopted it. He abandoned Walker, who left Kansas; and he\r\ndismissed Acting-Governor Frederick P. Stanton for convoking the (now\r\nfree-state) legislature. This body promptly ordered a vote on the third\r\nalternative, \"Against the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe free-state men ignored the alternatives set by the Lecompton\r\nConvention; but they participated nevertheless in the provisional\r\nelection for officers under the Lecompton government, capturing all\r\noffices, and then, the same day, voted overwhelmingly against the\r\nconstitution (Jan. 4, 1858).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Buchanan, against the urgent counsel of Governor Denver,\r\nurged on Congress (Feb. 2) the admission of Kansas under the Lecompton\r\nConstitution. He was opposed by Senator Stephen A. Douglas, the leader\r\nof the Northern Democracy. The Senate upheld the President; the House of\r\nRepresentatives voted down his policy; and finally both houses accepted\r\nthe English Bill, by which Kansas was virtually offered some millions of\r\nacres of public lands if she should accept the Lecompton\r\nConstitution.[4] On the 21st of August 1858, by a vote of 11,300 to\r\n1788, Kansas resisted this temptation. The plan of the Administration\r\nthus effectually miscarried, and its final result was a profound split\r\nin the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nThe free-state men framed an excellent anti-slavery constitution at\r\nLeavenworth in March-April 1858, but the origins of the convention were\r\nillegal and their work was still-born. On the 29th of July 1859 still\r\nanother constitution was therefore framed at Wyandotte, and on the 4th\r\nof October it was ratified by the people. Meanwhile the Topeka\r\n\"government\" disappeared, and also, with its single purpose equally\r\nserved, the free-state party, most of it (once largely Democratic)\r\npassing into the Republican party, now first organized in the Territory.\r\nOn the 29th of January 1861 Kansas was admitted to the Union under the\r\nWyandotte Constitution. The United States Census of 1860 gave her a\r\npopulation of 107,204 inhabitants. The struggle in Kansas, the first\r\nphysical national struggle over slavery, was of paramount importance in\r\nthe breaking up of the Whig party, the firm establishment of an\r\nuncompromisingly anti-slavery party, the sectionalization of the\r\nDemocracy, and the general preparation of the country for the Civil War.\r\n\r\nDrought and famine came in 1860, and then upon the impoverished state\r\ncame the strain of the Civil War. Nevertheless Kansas furnished\r\nproportionally a very large quota of men to the Union armies. Military\r\noperations within her own borders were largely confined to a guerrilla\r\nwarfare, carrying on the bitter neighbourhood strife between Kansas and\r\nMissouri. The Confederate officers began by repressing predatory\r\nplundering from Missouri; but after James H. Lane, with an undisciplined\r\nbrigade, had crossed the border, sacking, burning and killing in his\r\nprogress, Missouri \"bushrangers\" retaliated in kind. Freebooters trained\r\nin Territorial licence had a free hand on both sides. Kansas bands were\r\nlong the more successful. But William C. Quantrell, after sacking\r\nvarious small Kansas towns along the Missouri river (1862-63), in August\r\n1863 took Lawrence (q.v.) and put it mercilessly to fire and sword--the\r\nmost ghastly episode in border history. In the autumn of 1864 the\r\nConfederate general, Sterling Price, aiming to enter Kansas from\r\nMissouri but defeated by General Pleasanton's cavalry, retreated\r\nsouthward, zig-zagging on both sides of the Missouri-Kansas line. This\r\nended for Kansas the border raids and the war. Lane was probably the\r\nfirst United States officer to enlist negroes as soldiers. Many of them\r\n(and Indians too) fought bravely for the state. Indian raids and wars\r\ntroubled the state from 1864 to 1878. The tribes domiciled in Kansas\r\nwere rapidly moved to Indian Territory after 1868.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War the Republicans held uninterrupted supremacy in\r\nnational elections, and almost as complete control in the state\r\ngovernment, until 1892. From about 1870 onward, however, elements of\r\nreform and of discontent were embodied in a succession of radical\r\nparties of protest. Prohibition arose thus, was accepted by the\r\nRepublicans, and passed into the constitution. Woman suffrage became a\r\nvital political issue. Much legislation has been passed to control the\r\nrailways. General control of the media of commerce, economic\r\nco-operation, tax reform, banking reforms, legislation against\r\nmonopolies, disposal of state lands, legislation in aid of the farmer\r\nand labourer, have been issues of one party or another. The movement of\r\nthe Patrons of Industry (1874), growing into the Grange, Farmers'\r\nAlliance, and finally into the People's (Populist) party (see FARMERS'\r\nMOVEMENT), was perhaps of greatest importance. In conjunction with the\r\nDemocrats the Populists controlled the State government in 1892-1894 and\r\n1896-1898. These two parties decidedly outnumbered the Republicans at\r\nthe polls from 1890-1898, but they could win only by fusion. In\r\n1892-1893, when the Populists elected the governor and the Senate, and\r\nthe Republicans (as the courts eventually determined) the House of\r\nRepresentatives, political passion was so high as to threaten armed\r\nconflicts in the capital. The Australian ballot was introduced in 1893.\r\nIn the decade following 1880, struggles in the western counties for the\r\nlocation of county seats (the bitterest local political fights known in\r\nwestern states) repeatedly led to bloodshed and the interference of\r\nstate militia.\r\n\r\n    TERRITORIAL GOVERNORS[5]\r\n\r\n  Andrew H.

Topeka (37,641), Wichita (31,110), Leavenworth (20,934),\r\n    Atchison (18,159), Pittsburg (15,012), Coffeyville (13,196), Fort\r\n    Scott (12,248), Parsons (11,720), Lawrence (11,708), Hutchinson\r\n    (11,215), Independence (11,206), and Iola (10,287). Other cities of\r\n    above 5000 inhabitants each were: Chanute (9704), Emporia (8974),\r\n    Winfield (7845), Salina (7829), Ottawa (7727), Arkansas City (7634),\r\n    Newton (6601), Galena (6449), Argentine (6053), Junction City (5264)\r\n    and Cherryvale (5089).\r\n\r\n  [4] The English Bill was not a bribe to the degree that it has\r\n    usually been considered to be, inasmuch as it \"reduced the grant of\r\n    land demanded by the Lecompton Ordinance from 23,500,000 acres to\r\n    3,500,000 acres, and offered only the normal cession to new states.\"\r\n    But this grant of 3,500,000 acres was conditioned on the acceptance\r\n    of the Lecompton Constitution, and Congress made no promise of any\r\n    grant if that Constitution were not adopted. The bill was introduced\r\n    by William Hayden English (1822-1896), a Democratic representative in\r\n    Congress in 1853-1861 (see Frank H. Hodder, \"Some Aspects of the\r\n    English Bill for the Admission of Kansas,\" in _Annual Report of the\r\n    American Historical Association_ for the Year 1906, i. 201-210).\r\n\r\n  [5] Terms of actual service in Kansas, not period of commissions.

It is separated from its greater\r\nneighbour, Kansas City, Missouri, only by the state line, and is the\r\nlargest city in the state. Pop. (1890), 38,315; (1900), 51,418, of whom\r\n6,377 were foreign-born and 6509 were negroes; (1910 census) 82,331. It\r\nis served by the Union Pacific, the Missouri Pacific, the Chicago, Rock\r\nIsland & Pacific, and the Chicago Great Western railways, and by\r\nelectric lines connecting with Leavenworth and with Kansas City,\r\nMissouri. There are several bridges across the Kansas river. The city\r\ncovers the low, level bottom-land at the junction of the two rivers, and\r\nspreads over the surrounding highlands to the W., the principal\r\nresidential district. Its plan is regular. The first effective steps\r\ntoward a city park and boulevard system were taken in 1907, when a board\r\nof park commissioners, consisting of three members, was appointed by the\r\nmayor. The city has been divided into the South Park District and the\r\nNorth Park District, and at the close of 1908 there were 10 m. of\r\nboulevards and parks aggregating 160 acres. A massive steel and concrete\r\ntoll viaduct, about 1(3/4) m. in length, extends from the bluffs of\r\nKansas City, Kan., across the Kansas valley to the bluffs of Kansas\r\nCity, Mo., and is used by pedestrians, vehicles and street cars. There\r\nis a fine public library building given by Andrew Carnegie. The\r\ncharities of the city are co-ordinated through the associated charities.\r\nAmong charitable state-aided institutions are the St Margaret's hospital\r\n(Roman Catholic), Bethany hospital (Methodist), a children's home\r\n(1893), and, for negroes, the Douglass hospital training school for\r\nnurses (1898)--the last the largest private charity of the state. The\r\nmedical department of the Kansas state university, the other departments\r\nof which are in Lawrence, is in Kansas City; and among the other\r\neducational institutions of the city are the Western university and\r\nindustrial school (a co-educational school for negroes), the Kansas City\r\nBaptist theological seminary (1902), and the Kansas City university\r\n(Methodist Protestant, 1896), which had 454 students in 1908-1909 and\r\ncomprises Mather college (for liberal arts), Wilson high school\r\n(preparatory), a school of elocution and oratory (in Kansas City, Mo.),\r\na Normal School, Kansas City Hahnemann Medical College (in Kansas City,\r\nMo.), and a school of theology. The city is the seat of the Kansas\r\n(State) school for the blind. Kansas City is one of the largest cities\r\nin the country without a drinking saloon. Industrially the city is\r\nimportant for its stockyards and its meat-packing interests. With the\r\nexception of Chicago, it is the largest livestock market in the United\r\nStates. The product-value of the city's factories in 1905 was\r\n$96,473,050; 93.5% consisting of the product of the wholesale\r\nslaughtering and meat-packing houses. Especially in the South-west\r\nmarkets Kansas City has an advantage over Chicago, St Louis, and other\r\nlarge packing centres (except St Joseph), not only in freights, but in\r\nits situation among the \"corn and beef\" states; it shares also the\r\nextraordinary railway facilities of Kansas City, Missouri. There are\r\nvarious important manufactures, such as soap and candles, subsidiary to\r\nthe packing industry; and the city has large flour mills, railway and\r\nmachine shops, and foundries. A large cotton-mill, producing coarse\r\nfabrics, was opened in 1907. Natural gas derived from the Kansas fields\r\nbecame available for lighting and heating, and crude oil for fuel, in\r\n1906.\r\n\r\nKansas City was founded in 1886 by the consolidation of \"old\" Kansas\r\nCity, Armourdale and Wyandotte (in which Armstrong and Riverview were\r\nthen included). Of these municipalities Wyandotte, the oldest, was\r\noriginally settled by the Wyandotte Indians in 1843; it was platted and\r\nsettled by whites in 1857; and was incorporated as a town in 1858, and\r\nas a city in 1859. At Wyandotte were made the first moves for the\r\nTerritorial organization of Kansas and Nebraska. During the Kansas\r\nstruggle Wyandotte was a pro-slavery town, while Quindaro (1856), a few\r\nmiles up the Missouri, was a free-state settlement and Wyandotte's\r\ncommercial rival until after the Civil War. The convention that framed\r\nthe constitution, the Wyandotte Constitution, under which Kansas was\r\nadmitted to the Union, met here in July 1859. \"Old\" Kansas City was\r\nsurveyed in 1869 and was incorporated as a city in 1872. Armourdale was\r\nlaid out in 1880 and incorporated in 1882. The packing interest was\r\nfirst established in 1867; the first large packing plant was that of\r\nArmour & Co., which was removed to what is now Kansas City in 1871.\r\nKansas City adopted government by commission in 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS CITY, a city and port of entry of Jackson county, Missouri,\r\nU.S.A., the second in size and importance in the state, situated at the\r\nconfluence of the Missouri and Kansas rivers, adjoining Kansas City,\r\nKansas, and 235 m. W. by N. of St Louis. Pop. (1890), 132,716; (1900),\r\n163,752, of whom 18,410 were foreign born (German, 4816; Irish, 3507;\r\nSwedish, 1869; English, 1863; English-Canadian, 1369; Italian, 1034),\r\nand 17,567 were negroes; (1910 census) 248,381. Kansas City, the gateway\r\nto the South-west, is one of the leading railway centres of the United\r\nStates. It is served by the Union Pacific, the Missouri Pacific, the\r\n'Frisco System, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, the Atchison, Topeka &\r\nSanta Fe, the Chicago Great Western, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St Paul,\r\nthe Chicago & Alton, the Wabash, the Kansas City Southern, the Chicago,\r\nRock Island & Pacific, the Missouri, Kansas & Texas, the Leavenworth,\r\nKansas & Western, the Kansas City, Mexico & Orient, the St Louis, Kansas\r\nCity & Colorado, the Quincy, Omaha & Kansas City, and the St Joseph &\r\nGrand Island railways, and by steamboat lines to numerous river ports.\r\n\r\nThe present retail, office, and wholesale sections were once high bluffs\r\nand deep ravines, but through and across these well graded streets were\r\nconstructed. South and west of this highland, along the Kansas river, is\r\na low, level tract occupied chiefly by railway yards, stock yards,\r\nwholesale houses and manufacturing establishments; north and east of the\r\nhighland is a flat section, the Missouri River bottoms, occupied largely\r\nby manufactories, railway yards, grain elevators and homes of employes.\r\nMuch high and dry \"made\" land has been reclaimed from the river\r\nflood-plain. Two great railway bridges across the Missouri, many smaller\r\nbridges across the Kansas, and a great inter-state toll viaduct\r\nextending from bluff to bluff across the valley of the latter river, lie\r\nwithin the metropolitan area of the two cities. The streets of the\r\nMissouri city are generally wide and excellently paved. The city-hall\r\n(1890-1893), the courthouse (1888-1892), and the Federal Building\r\n(1892-1900) are the most imposing of the public buildings. A convention\r\nhall, 314 ft. long and 198 ft. wide, with a seating capacity of about\r\n15,000, is covered by a steel-frame roof without a column for its\r\nsupport; the exterior of the walls is cut stone and brick. The building\r\nwas erected within three months, to replace one destroyed by fire, for\r\nthe National Democratic Convention which met here on the 4th of July\r\n1900. The Public Library with walls of white limestone and Texas\r\ngranite, contained (1908) 95,000 volumes. The Congregational, the\r\nCalvary Baptist, the Second Presbyterian, the Independence Avenue\r\nChristian, the Independence Avenue Methodist, and the Second Christian\r\nScience churches are the finest church buildings. The board of trade\r\nbuilding, the building of the _Star_ newspaper, and several large office\r\nbuildings (including the Scarritt, Long, and New York Life Insurance\r\nbuildings) are worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nKansas City has over 2000 acres in public parks; but Swope Park,\r\ncontaining 1354 acres, lies south of the city limits. The others are\r\ndistributed with a design to give each section a recreation ground\r\nwithin easy walking distance, and all (including Swope) are connected by\r\nparkways, boulevards and street-car lines. The Paseo Parkway, 250 ft.\r\nwide, extends from N. to S. through the centre of the city for a\r\ndistance of 2(1/2) m., and adjoining it near its middle is the Parade,\r\nor principal playground. The city has eight cemeteries, the largest of\r\nwhich are Union, Elmwood, Mt Washington, St Mary's and Forest Hill. The\r\ncharitable institutions and professional schools included in 1908 about\r\nthirty hospitals, several children's homes and homes for the aged, an\r\nindustrial home, the Kansas City school of law, the University medical\r\ncollege, and the Scarritt training school. The city has an excellent\r\npublic school system. A Methodist Episcopal institutional church,\r\nadmirably equipped, was opened in 1906. The city has a juvenile court,\r\nand maintains a free employment bureau.\r\n\r\nKansas City is primarily a commercial centre, and its trade in\r\nlivestock, grain and agricultural implements is especially large. The\r\nannual pure-bred livestock show is of national importance. The city's\r\nfactory product increased from $23,588,653 in 1900 to $35,573,049 in\r\n1905, or 50.8%. Natural gas and crude petroleum from Kansas fields\r\nbecame of industrial importance about 1906. Natural gas is used to light\r\nthe residence streets and to heat many of the residences.\r\n\r\nKansas City is one of the few cities in the United States empowered to\r\nframe its own charter. The first was adopted in 1875 and the second in\r\n1889. In 1905 a new charter, drawn on the lines of the model \"municipal\r\nprogram\" advocated by the National Municipal League, was submitted to\r\npopular vote, but was defeated by the influence of the saloons and other\r\nspecial interests. The charter of 1908 is a revision of this proposed\r\ncharter of 1905 with the objectionable features eliminated; it was\r\nadopted by a large majority vote. Under the provisions of the charter of\r\n1908 the people elect a mayor, city treasurer, city comptroller, and\r\njudges of the municipal court, each for a term of two years. The\r\nlegislative body is the common council composed of two houses, each\r\nhaving as many members as there are wards in the city--14 in 1908. The\r\nmembers of the lower house are elected, one by each ward, in the spring\r\nof each even numbered year. The upper house members are elected by the\r\ncity at large and serve four years. A board of public works, board of\r\npark commissioners, board of fire and water commissioners, a board of\r\ncivil service, a city counsellor, a city auditor, a city assessor, a\r\npurchasing agent, and subordinate officers, are appointed by the mayor,\r\nwithout confirmation by the common council. A non-partisan board\r\ncomposed of citizens who must not be physicians has general control of\r\nthe city's hospitals and health department. A new hospital at a cost of\r\nhalf a million dollars was completed in 1908. The charter provides for a\r\nreferendum vote on franchises, which may be ordered by the council or by\r\npetition of the people, the signatures of 20% of the registered voters\r\nbeing sufficient to force such election. Public work may be prevented by\r\nremonstrance of interested property owners except in certain instances,\r\nwhen the city, by vote of the people, may overrule all remonstrances. A\r\ncivic league attempts to give a non-partisan estimate of all municipal\r\ncandidates. The juvenile court, the arts and tenement commissions, the\r\nmunicipal employment bureau, and a park board are provided for by the\r\ncharter. All the members of the city board of election commissioners and\r\na majority of the police board are appointed by the governor of the\r\nstate; and the police control the grant of liquor licences. The city is\r\nsupplied with water drawn from the Missouri river above the mouth of the\r\nKansas or Kaw (which is used as a sewer by Kansas City, Kan.); the main\r\npumping station and settling basins being at Quindaro, several miles up\r\nthe river in Kansas; whence the water is carried beneath the Kansas,\r\nthrough a tunnel, to a high-pressure distributing station in the west\r\nbottoms. The waterworks (direct pressure system) were acquired by the\r\ncity in 1895. All other public services are in private hands. The\r\nstreet-railway service is based on a universal 5-cent transfer\r\nthroughout the metropolitan area. Some of the first overhead electric\r\ntrolleys used in the United States were used here in 1885.\r\n\r\nThe first permanent settlement within the present limits of Kansas City,\r\nwhich took its name from Kansas river,[1] was established by French fur\r\ntraders about 1821. Westport, a little inland town--platted 1833, a city\r\n1857, merged in Kansas City in 1899--now a fashionable residence\r\ndistrict of Kansas City--was a rival of Independence in the Santa Fe\r\ntrade which she gained almost _in toto_ in 1844 when the great Missouri\r\nflood (the greatest the river has known) destroyed the river landing\r\nutilized by Independence. Meanwhile, what is now Kansas City, and was\r\nthen Westport Landing, being on the river where a swift current wore a\r\nrocky shore, steadily increased in importance and overshadowed Westport.\r\nBut in 1838 lots were surveyed and the name changed to the Town of\r\nKansas. It was officially organized in part in 1847, formally\r\nincorporated as a town in 1850, chartered under its present name in\r\n1853, re-chartered in 1875, in 1889 and in 1908. Before 1850 it was\r\npractically the exclusive eastern terminus on the river for the Santa Fe\r\ntrade,[2] and a great outfitting point for Californian emigrants. The\r\nhistory of this border trade is full of picturesque colour. During the\r\nCivil War both Independence and Westport were the scene of battles;\r\nKansas City escaped, but her trade went to Leavenworth, where it had the\r\nprotection of an army post and a quiet frontier. After the war the\r\nrailways came, taking away the traffic to Santa Fe, and other cities\r\nfarther up the Missouri river took over the trade to its upper valley.\r\nIn 1866 Kansas City was entered by the first railway from St Louis; 1867\r\nsaw the beginning of the packing industry; in 1869 a railway bridge\r\nacross the Missouri assured it predominance over Leavenworth and St\r\nJoseph; and since that time--save for a depression shortly after 1890,\r\nfollowing a real-estate boom--the material progress of the city has been\r\nremarkable; the population increased from 4418 in 1860 to 32,260 in\r\n1870, 55,785 in 1880, and 132,716 in 1890.\r\n\r\n  See T. S. Case (ed.), _History of Kansas City, Missouri_ (Syracuse,\r\n  1888); William Griffith, _History of Kansas City_ (Kansas City, 1900);\r\n  for industrial history, the _Greater Kansas City Yearbook_ (1907\r\n  seq.); for all features of municipal interest, the _Kansas City\r\n  Annual_ (Kansas City, 1907 seq.), prepared for the Business Men's\r\n  League.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] \"Kansas\"--in archaic variants of spelling and pronunciation,\r\n    \"Kansaw,\" and still called, locally and colloquially, the \"Kaw.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] Before Kansas City, first Old Franklin (opposite Boonville), then\r\n    Ft. Osage, Liberty, Sibley, Lexington, Independence and Westport had\r\n    successively been abandoned as terminals, as the transfer-point from\r\n    boat to prairie caravan was moved steadily up the Missouri. Whisky,\r\n    groceries, prints and notions were staples sent to Santa Fe; wool,\r\n    buffalo robes and dried buffalo meat, Mexican silver coin, gold and\r\n    silver dust and ore came in return. In 1860 the trade employed 3000\r\n    wagons and 7000 men, and amounted to millions of dollars in value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSK, a town of eastern Siberia, in the government of Yeniseisk, 151 m.\r\nby rail E. of Krasnoyarsk, on the Kan River, a tributary of the Yenisei,\r\nand on the Siberian highway.

It is the chief town of\r\na district in which gold is found, but lies on low ground subject to\r\ninundation by the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAN-SUH, a north-western province of China, bounded N. by Mongolia, E.\r\nby Shen-si, S. by Szech'uen, W. by Tibet and N.W. by Turkestan. The\r\nboundary on the N. remains undefined, but the province may be said to\r\noccupy the territory lying between 32 deg. 30'40 deg. N., and 108 deg.\r\nand 98 deg. 20' E., and to contain about 260,000 sq. m. The population\r\nis estimated at 9,800,000. Western Kan-suh is mountainous, and largely a\r\nwilderness of sand and snow, but east of the Hwang-ho the country is\r\ncultivated. The principal river is the Hwang-ho, and in the mountains to\r\nthe south of Lan-chow Fu rises the Wei-ho, which traverses Shen-si and\r\nflows into the Hwang-ho at Tung-kwan. The chief products of Kan-suh are\r\ncloth, horse hides, a kind of curd like butter which is known by the\r\nMongols under the name of _wuta_, musk, plums, onions, dates, sweet\r\nmelons and medicines. (See CHINA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANT, IMMANUEL (1724-1804), German philosopher, was born at Konigsberg\r\non the 22nd of April 1724. His grandfather was an emigrant from\r\nScotland, and the name Cant is not uncommon in the north of Scotland,\r\nwhence the family is said to have come. His father was a saddler in\r\nKonigsberg, then a stronghold of Pietism, to the strong influence of\r\nwhich Kant was subjected in his early years. In his tenth year he was\r\nentered at the Collegium Fredericianum with the definite view of\r\nstudying theology. His inclination at this time was towards classics,\r\nand he was recognized, with his school-fellow, David Ruhnken, as among\r\nthe most promising classical scholars of the college. His taste for the\r\ngreater Latin authors, particularly Lucretius, was never lost, and he\r\nacquired at school an unusual facility in Latin composition. With Greek\r\nauthors he does not appear to have been equally familiar. During his\r\nuniversity course, which began in 1740, Kant was principally attracted\r\ntowards mathematics and physics. The lectures on classics do not seem to\r\nhave satisfied him, and, though he attended courses on theology, and\r\neven preached on one or two occasions, he appears finally to have given\r\nup the intention of entering the Church. The last years of his\r\nuniversity studies were much disturbed by poverty. His father died in\r\n1746, and for nine years he was compelled to earn his own living as a\r\nprivate tutor. Although he disliked the life and was not specially\r\nqualified for it--as he used to say regarding the excellent precepts of\r\nhis _Padagogik_, he was never able to apply them--yet he added to his\r\nother accomplishments a grace and polish which he displayed ever\r\nafterwards to a degree somewhat unusual in a philosopher by profession.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 Kant became tutor in the family of Count Kayserling. By the\r\nkindness of a friend named Richter, he was enabled to resume his\r\nuniversity career, and in the autumn of that year he graduated as doctor\r\nand qualified as privatdocent. For fifteen years he continued to labour\r\nin this position, his fame as writer and lecturer steadily increasing.\r\nThough twice he failed to obtain a professorship at Konigsberg, he\r\nsteadily refused appointments elsewhere. The only academic preferment\r\nreceived by him during the lengthy probation was the post of\r\nunder-librarian (1766). His lectures, at first mainly upon physics,\r\ngradually expanded until nearly all descriptions of philosophy were\r\nincluded under them.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 he obtained the chair of logic and metaphysics at Konigsberg,\r\nand delivered as his inaugural address the dissertation _De mundi\r\nsensibilis et intelligibilis forma et principiis_. Eleven years later\r\nappeared the _Kritik of Pure Reason_, the work towards which he had been\r\nsteadily advancing, and of which all his later writings are\r\ndevelopments. In 1783 he published the _Prolegomena_, intended as an\r\nintroduction to the _Kritik_, which had been found to stand in need of\r\nsome explanatory comment. A second edition of the _Kritik_, with some\r\nmodifications, appeared in 1787, after which it remained unaltered.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its frequent obscurity, its novel terminology, and its\r\ndeclared opposition to prevailing systems, the Kantian philosophy made\r\nrapid progress in Germany. In the course of ten or twelve years from the\r\npublication of the _Kritik of Pure Reason_, it was expounded in all the\r\nleading universities, and it even penetrated into the schools of the\r\nChurch of Rome. Such men as J. Schulz in Konigsberg, J. G. Kiesewetter\r\nin Berlin, Jakob in Halle, Born and A. L. Heydenreich in Leipzig, K. L.\r\nReinhold and E. Schmid in Jena, Buhle in Gottingen, Tennemann in\r\nMarburg, and Snell in Giessen, with many others, made it the basis of\r\ntheir philosophical teaching, while theologians like Tieftrunk,\r\nStaudlin, and Ammon eagerly applied it to Christian doctrine and\r\nmorality. Young men flocked to Konigsberg as to a shrine of philosophy.\r\nThe Prussian Government even undertook the expense of their support.\r\nKant was hailed by some as a second Messiah. He was consulted as an\r\noracle on all questions of casuistry--as, for example, on the lawfulness\r\nof inoculation for the small-pox. This universal homage for a long time\r\nleft Kant unaffected; it was only in his later years that he spoke of\r\nhis system as the limit of philosophy, and resented all further\r\nprogress. He still pursued his quiet round of lecturing and authorship,\r\nand contributed from time to time papers to the literary journals. Of\r\nthese, among the most remarkable was his review of Herder's _Philosophy\r\nof History_, which greatly exasperated that author, and led to a violent\r\nact of retaliation some years after in his _Metakritik of Pure Reason_.\r\nSchiller at this period in vain sought to engage Kant upon his _Horen_.\r\nHe remained true to the _Berlin Journal_, in which most of his\r\ncriticisms appeared.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Kant, in the full height of his reputation, was involved in a\r\ncollision with the Government on the question of his religious\r\ndoctrines. Naturally his philosophy had excited the declared opposition\r\nof all adherents of historical Christianity, since its plain tendency\r\nwas towards a moral rationalism, and it could not be reconciled to the\r\nliteral doctrines of the Lutheran Church. It would have been much better\r\nto permit his exposition of the philosophy of religion to enjoy the same\r\nliterary rights as his earlier works, since Kant could not be\r\ninterdicted without first silencing a multitude of theologians who were\r\nat least equally separated from positive Christianity. The Government,\r\nhowever, judged otherwise; and after the first part of his book, _On\r\nReligion within the Limits of Reason alone_, had appeared in the _Berlin\r\nJournal_, the publication of the remainder, which treats in a more\r\nrationalizing style of the peculiarities of Christianity, was forbidden.\r\nKant, thus shut out from Berlin, availed himself of his local privilege,\r\nand, with the sanction of the theological faculty of his own university,\r\npublished the full work in Konigsberg. The Government, probably\r\ninfluenced as much by hatred and fear of the French Revolution, of which\r\nKant was supposed to be a partisan, as by love of orthodoxy, resented\r\nthe act; and a secret cabinet order was received by him intimating the\r\ndispleasure of the king, Frederick William II., and exacting a pledge\r\nnot to lecture or write at all on religious subjects in future. With\r\nthis mandate Kant, after a struggle, complied, and kept his engagement\r\ntill 1797, when the death of the king, according to his construction of\r\nhis promise, set him free. This incident, however, produced a very\r\nunfavourable effect on his spirits. He withdrew in 1794 from society;\r\nnext year he gave up all his classes but one public lecture on logic or\r\nmetaphysics; and in 1797, before the removal of the interdict on his\r\ntheological teaching, he ceased altogether his public labours, after an\r\nacademic course of forty-two years. He previously, in the same year,\r\nfinished his treatises on the _Metaphysics of Ethics_, which, with his\r\n_Anthropology_, completed in 1798, were the last considerable works that\r\nhe revised with his own hand. His _Lectures on Logic_, on _Physical\r\nGeography_, on _Paedagogics_, were edited during his lifetime by his\r\nfriends and pupils. By way of asserting his right to resume theological\r\ndisquisition, he also issued in 1798 his _Strife of the Faculties_, in\r\nwhich all the strongest points of his work on religion were urged\r\nafresh, and the correspondence that had passed between himself and his\r\ncensors was given to the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of his retirement from the chair Kant declined in\r\nstrength, and gave tokens of intellectual decay. His memory began to\r\nfail, and a large work at which he wrought night and day, on the\r\nconnexion between physics and metaphysics, was found to be only a\r\nrepetition of his already published doctrines. After 1802, finding\r\nhimself attacked with a weakness in the limbs attended with frequent\r\nfits of falling, he mitigated the Spartan severity of his life, and\r\nconsented to receive medical advice. A constant restlessness oppressed\r\nhim; his sight gave way; his conversation became an extraordinary\r\nmixture of metaphors; and it was only at intervals that gleams of his\r\nformer power broke out, especially when some old chord of association\r\nwas struck in natural science or physical geography. A few days before\r\nhis decease, with a great effort he thanked his medical attendant for\r\nhis visits in the words, \"I have not yet lost my feeling for humanity.\"\r\nOn the 12th of February 1804 he died, having almost completed his\r\neightieth year. His stature was small, and his appearance feeble. He was\r\nlittle more than five feet high; his breast was almost concave, and,\r\nlike Schleiermacher, he was deformed in the right shoulder. His senses\r\nwere quick and delicate; and, though of weak constitution, he escaped\r\nby strict regimen all serious illness.\r\n\r\nHis life was arranged with mechanical regularity; and, as he never\r\nmarried, he kept the habits of his studious youth to old age. His\r\nman-servant, who awoke him summer and winter at five o'clock, testified\r\nthat he had not once failed in thirty years to respond to the call.\r\nAfter rising he studied for two hours, then lectured other two, and\r\nspent the rest of the forenoon, till one, at his desk. He then dined at\r\na restaurant, which he frequently changed, to avoid the influx of\r\nstrangers, who crowded to see and hear him. This was his only regular\r\nmeal; and he often prolonged the conversation till late in the\r\nafternoon. He then walked out for at least an hour in all weathers, and\r\nspent the evening in lighter reading, except an hour or two devoted to\r\nthe preparation of his next day's lectures, after which he retired\r\nbetween nine and ten to rest. In his earlier years he often spent his\r\nevenings in general society, where his knowledge and conversational\r\ntalents made him the life of every party. He was especially intimate\r\nwith the families of two English merchants of the name of Green and\r\nMotherby, where he found many opportunities of meeting ship-captains,\r\nand other travelled persons, and thus gratifying his passion for\r\nphysical geography. This social circle included also the celebrated J.\r\nG. Hamann, the friend of Herder and Jacobi, who was thus a mediator\r\nbetween Kant and these philosophical adversaries.\r\n\r\nKant's reading was of the most extensive and miscellaneous kind. He\r\ncared comparatively little for the history of speculation, but his\r\nacquaintance with books of science, general history, travels and belles\r\nlettres was boundless. He was well versed in English literature, chiefly\r\nof the age of Queen Anne, and had read English philosophy from Locke to\r\nHume, and the Scottish school. He was at home in Voltaire and Rousseau,\r\nbut had little or no acquaintance with the French sensational\r\nphilosophy. He was familiar with all German literature up to the date of\r\nhis _Kritik_, but ceased to follow it in its great development by Goethe\r\nand Schiller. It was his habit to obtain books in sheets from his\r\npublishers Kanter and Nicolovius; and he read over for many years all\r\nthe new works in their catalogue, in order to keep abreast of universal\r\nknowledge. He was fond of newspapers and works on politics; and this was\r\nthe only kind of reading that could interrupt his studies in philosophy.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer, Kant avoided altogether that rigid style in which his\r\nbooks were written. He sat behind a low desk, with a few jottings on\r\nslips of paper, or textbooks marked on the margin, before him, and\r\ndelivered an extemporaneous address, opening up the subject by partial\r\nglimpses, and with many anecdotes or familiar illustrations, till a\r\ncomplete idea of it was presented. His voice was extremely weak, but\r\nsometimes rose into eloquence, and always commanded perfect silence.\r\nThough kind to his students, he refused to remit their fees, as this, he\r\nthought, would discourage independence. It was another principle that\r\nhis chief exertions should be bestowed on the intermediate class of\r\ntalent, as the geniuses would help themselves, and the dunces were\r\nbeyond remedy.\r\n\r\nSimple, honourable, truthful, kind-hearted and high-minded as Kant was\r\nin all moral respects, he was somewhat deficient in the region of\r\nsentiment. He had little enthusiasm for the beauties of nature, and\r\nindeed never sailed out into the Baltic, or travelled more than 40 miles\r\nfrom Konigsberg. Music he disregarded, and all poetry that was more than\r\nsententious prose. His ethics have been reproached with some justice as\r\nsetting up too low an ideal for the female sex. Though faithful in a\r\nhigh degree to the duties of friendship, he could not bear to visit his\r\nfriends in sickness, and after their death he repressed all allusion to\r\ntheir memory. His engrossing intellectual labours no doubt tended\r\nsomewhat to harden his character; and in his zeal for rectitude of\r\npurpose he forgot the part which affection and sentiment must ever play\r\nin the human constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of February 1904, the hundredth anniversary of Kant's death,\r\na Kantian society (_Kantgesellschaft_) was formed at Halle under the\r\nleadership of Professor H. Vaihinger to promote Kantian studies. In 1909\r\nit had an annual membership of 191; it supports the periodical\r\n_Kantstudien_ (founded 1896; see BIBLIOGRAPHY, _ad init._).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRITINGS OF KANT\r\n\r\n  No other thinker of modern times has been throughout his work so\r\n  penetrated with the fundamental conceptions of physical science; no\r\n  other has been able to hold with such firmness the balance between\r\n  empirical and speculative ideas. Beyond all question much of the\r\n  influence which the critical philosophy has exercised and continues to\r\n  exercise must be ascribed to this characteristic feature in the\r\n  training of its great author.\r\n\r\n  The early writings of Kant are almost without exception on questions\r\n  of physical science. It was only by degrees that philosophical\r\n  problems began to engage his attention, and that the main portion of\r\n  his literary activity was turned towards them. The following are the\r\n  most important of the works which bear directly on physical science.\r\n\r\n  1. _Gedanken von der wahren Schatzung der lebendigen Krafte_ (1747);\r\n  an essay dealing with the famous dispute between the Cartesians and\r\n  Leibnitzians regarding the expression for the _amount of a force_.\r\n  According to the Cartesians, this quantity was directly proportional\r\n  to velocity; according to their opponents, it varied with the square\r\n  of the velocity. The dispute has now lost its interest, for physicists\r\n  have learned to distinguish accurately the two quantities which are\r\n  vaguely included under the expression _amount of force_, and\r\n  consequently have been able to show in what each party was correct and\r\n  in what it was in error. Kant's essay, with some fallacious\r\n  explanations and divisions, criticizes acutely the arguments of the\r\n  Leibnitzians, and concludes with an attempt to show that both modes of\r\n  expression are correct when correctly limited and interpreted.\r\n\r\n  2. _Whether the Earth in its Revolution has experienced some Change\r\n  since the Earliest Times_ (1754; ed. and trans., W. Hastie, 1900,\r\n  _Kant's Cosmogony_; cf. Lord Kelvin in _The Age of the Earth_, 1897,\r\n  p. 7). In this brief essay Kant throws out a notion which has since\r\n  been carried out, in ignorance of Kant's priority, by Delaunay (1865)\r\n  and Adams. He points out that the action of the moon in raising the\r\n  waters of the earth must have a secondary effect in the slight\r\n  retardation of the earth's motion, and refers to a similar cause the\r\n  fact that the moon turns always the same face to the earth.\r\n\r\n  3. _Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels_, published\r\n  anonymously in 1755 (4th ed. 1808; republished H. Ebert, 1890). In\r\n  this remarkable work Kant, proceeding from the Newtonian conception of\r\n  the solar system, extends his consideration to the entire sidereal\r\n  system, points out how the whole may be mechanically regarded, and\r\n  throws out the important speculation which has since received the\r\n  title of the nebular hypothesis. In some details, such e.g. as the\r\n  regarding of the motion of the entire solar system as portion of the\r\n  general cosmical mechanism, he had predecessors, among others Thomas\r\n  Wright of Durham, but the work as a whole contains a wonderfully acute\r\n  anticipation of much that was afterwards carried out by Herschel and\r\n  Laplace. The hypothesis of the original nebular condition of the\r\n  system, with the consequent explanation of the great phenomena of\r\n  planetary formations and movements of the satellites and rings, is\r\n  unquestionably to be assigned to Kant. (On this question see\r\n  discussion in W. Hastie's _Kant's Cosmogony_, as above.)\r\n\r\n  4. _Meditalionum quarundam de igne succincta delineatio_ (1755): an\r\n  inaugural dissertation, containing little beyond the notion that\r\n  bodies operate on one another through the medium of a uniformly\r\n  diffused, elastic and subtle matter (ether) which is the underlying\r\n  substance of heat and light. Both heat and light are regarded as\r\n  vibrations of this diffused ether.\r\n\r\n  5. _On the Causes of Earthquakes_ (1755); _Description of the\r\n  Earthquake of 1755_ (1756); _Consideration of some Recently\r\n  Experienced Earthquakes_ (1756).\r\n\r\n  6. _Explanatory Remarks on the Theory of the Winds_ (1756). In this\r\n  brief tract, Kant, apparently in entire ignorance of the explanation\r\n  given in 1735 by Hadley, points out how the varying velocity of\r\n  rotation of the successive zones of the earth's surface furnishes a\r\n  key to the phenomena of periodic winds. His theory is in almost entire\r\n  agreement with that now received. See the parallel statements from\r\n  Kant's tract and Dove's essay on the influence of the rotation of the\r\n  earth on the flow of its atmosphere (1835), given in Zollner's work,\r\n  _Ueber die Natur der Cometen_, pp. 477-482.\r\n\r\n  7. _On the Different Races of Men_ (1775); _Determination of the\r\n  Notion of a Human Race_ (1785); _Conjectural Beginning of Human\r\n  History_ (1786): three tracts containing some points of interest as\r\n  regards the empirical grounds for Kant's doctrine of teleology.\r\n  Reference will be made to them in the notice of the _Kritik of\r\n  Judgment_.\r\n\r\n  8. _On the Volcanoes in the Moon_ (1785); _On the Influence of the\r\n  Moon on the Weather_ (1794). The second of these contains a remarkable\r\n  discussion of the relation between the centre of the moon's figure and\r\n  its centre of gravity. From the difference between these Kant is led\r\n  to conjecture that the climatic conditions of the side of the moon\r\n  turned from us must be altogether unlike those of the face presented\r\n  to us. His views have been restated by Hansen.\r\n\r\n  9. _Lectures on Physical Geography_ (1822): published from notes of\r\n  Kant's lectures, with the approval of the author.\r\n\r\n  Consideration of these works is sufficient to show that Kant's mastery\r\n  of the science of his time was complete and thorough, and that his\r\n  philosophy is to be dealt with as having throughout a reference to\r\n  general scientific conceptions. For more detailed treatment of his\r\n  importance in science, reference may be made to Zollner's essay on\r\n  \"Kant and his Merits on Natural Science\" contained in the work on the\r\n  _Nature of Comets_ (pp. 426-484); to Dietrich, _Kant and Newton_;\r\n  Schultze, _Kant and Darwin_; Reuschle's careful analysis of the\r\n  scientific works in the _Deutsche Vierteljahrs-Schrift_ (1868); W.\r\n  Hastie's introduction to _Kant's Cosmogony_ (1900), which summarizes\r\n  criticism to that date; and articles in _Kant-Studien_ (1896 foll.).\r\n\r\n  The notice of the philosophical writings of Kant need not be more than\r\n  bibliographical, as in the account of his philosophy it will be\r\n  necessary to consider at some length the successive stages in the\r\n  development of his thought. Arranged chronologically these works are\r\n  as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1755. _Principiorum primorum cognitionis metaphysicae novae\r\n  dilucidatio._\r\n\r\n  1756. _Metaphysicae cum geometria junctae usus in philosophia\r\n  naturali, cujus specimen I. continet monadologiam physicam._\r\n\r\n  1762. _Die falsche Spitzfindigkeit der vier syllogistischen Figuren_,\r\n  \"The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures\" (trans.

Perhaps in no\r\n  case is the character of an epoch more clearly apparent than in that\r\n  of the critical philosophy. The great work of Kant absolutely closed\r\n  the lines of speculation along which the philosophical literature of\r\n  the 18th century had proceeded, and substituted for them a new and\r\n  more comprehensive method of regarding the essential problems of\r\n  thought, a method which has prescribed the course of philosophic\r\n  speculation in the present age. The critical system has thus a twofold\r\n  aspect. It takes up into itself what had characterized the previous\r\n  efforts of modern thought, shows the imperfect nature of the\r\n  fundamental notions therein employed, and offers a new solution of the\r\n  problems to which these notions had been applied. It opens up a new\r\n  series of questions upon which subsequent philosophic reflection has\r\n  been directed, and gives to them the form, under which it is possible\r\n  that they should be fruitfully regarded. A work of this kind is\r\n  essentially epoch-making.\r\n\r\n  In any complete account of the Kantian system it is therefore\r\n  necessary that there should be constant reference, on the one hand, to\r\n  the peculiar character of the preceding 18th-century philosophy, and,\r\n  on the other hand, to the problems left for renewed treatment to more\r\n  modern thought. Fortunately the development of the Kantian system\r\n  itself furnishes such treatment as is necessary of the former\r\n  reference. For the critical philosophy was a work of slow growth. In\r\n  the early writings of Kant we are able to trace with great\r\n  definiteness the successive stages through which he passed from the\r\n  notions of the preceding philosophy to the new and comprehensive\r\n  method which gives its special character to the critical work.\r\n  Scarcely any great mind, it has been said with justice, ever matured\r\n  so slowly. In the early essays we find the principles of the current\r\n  philosophies, those of Leibnitz and English empiricism, applied in\r\n  various directions to those problems which serve as tests of their\r\n  truth and completeness; we note the appearance of the difficulties or\r\n  contradictions which manifest the one-sidedness or imperfection of the\r\n  principle applied; and we can trace the gradual growth of the new\r\n  conceptions which were destined, in the completed system, to take the\r\n  place of the earlier method. To understand the Kantian work it is\r\n  indispensable to trace the history of its growth in the mind of its\r\n  author.\r\n\r\n  Of the two preceding stages of modern philosophy, only the second,\r\n  that of Locke and Leibnitz, seems to have influenced practically the\r\n  course of Kant's speculation. With the Cartesian movement as a whole\r\n  he shows little acquaintance and no sympathy, and his own philosophic\r\n  conception is never brought into relation with the systematic\r\n  treatment of metaphysical problems characteristic of the Cartesian\r\n  method. The fundamental question for philosophic reflection presented\r\n  itself to him in the form which it had assumed in the hands of Locke\r\n  and his successors in England, of Leibnitz and the Leibnitzian school\r\n  in Germany. The transition from the Cartesian movement to this second\r\n  stage of modern thought had doubtless been natural and indeed\r\n  necessary. Nevertheless the full bearings of the philosophic question\r\n  were somewhat obscured by the comparatively limited fashion in which\r\n  it was then regarded. The tendency towards what may be technically\r\n  called subjectivism, a tendency which differentiates the modern from\r\n  the ancient method of speculation, is expressed in Locke and Leibnitz\r\n  in a definite and peculiar fashion. However widely the two systems\r\n  differ in details, they are at one in a certain fundamental conception\r\n  which dominates the whole course of their philosophic construction.\r\n  They are throughout individualist, i.e. they accept as given fact the\r\n  existence of the concrete, thinking subject, and endeavour to show how\r\n  this subject, as an individual conscious being, is related to the\r\n  wider universe of which he forms part. In dealing with such a problem,\r\n  there are evidently two lines along which investigation may proceed.\r\n  It may be asked how the individual mind comes to know himself and the\r\n  system of things with which he is connected, how the varied contents\r\n  of his experience are to be accounted for, and what certainty attaches\r\n  to his subjective consciousness of things. Regarded from the\r\n  individualist point of view, this line of inquiry becomes purely\r\n  psychological, and the answer may be presented, as it was presented by\r\n  Locke, in the fashion of a natural history of the growth of conscious\r\n  experience in the mind of the subject. Or, it may be further asked,\r\n  how is the individual really connected with the system of things\r\n  apparently disclosed to him in conscious experience? what is the\r\n  precise significance of the existence which he ascribes both to\r\n  himself and to the objects of experience? what is the nature of the\r\n  relation between himself as one part of the system, and the system as\r\n  a whole? This second inquiry is specifically metaphysical in bearing,\r\n  and the kind of answer furnished to it by Leibnitz on the one hand, by\r\n  Berkeley on the other, is in fact prescribed or determined beforehand\r\n  by the fundamental conception of the individualist method with which\r\n  both begin their investigations. So soon as we make clear to ourselves\r\n  the essential nature of this method, we are able to discern the\r\n  specific difficulties or perplexities arising in the attempt to carry\r\n  it out systematically, and thus to note with precision the special\r\n  problems presented to Kant at the outset of his philosophic\r\n  reflections.\r\n\r\n  Consider, first, the application of the method on its psychological\r\n  side, as it appears in Locke. Starting with the assumption of\r\n  conscious experience as the content or filling-in of the individual\r\n  mind, Locke proceeds to explain its genesis and nature by reference to\r\n  the real universe of things and its mechanical operation upon the\r\n  mind. The result of the interaction of mind, i.e. the individual mind,\r\n  and the system of things, is conscious experience, consisting of\r\n  ideas, which may be variously compounded, divided, compared, or dealt\r\n  with by the subjective faculties or powers with which the entity,\r\n  Mind, is supposed to be endowed. Matter of fact and matter of\r\n  knowledge are thus at a stroke dissevered. The very notion of relation\r\n  between mind and things leads at once to the counter notion of the\r\n  absolute restriction of mind to its own subjective nature. That Locke\r\n  was unable to reconcile these opposed notions is not surprising; that\r\n  the difficulties and obscurities of the Essay arise from the\r\n  impossibility of reconciling them is evident on the slightest\r\n  consideration of the main positions of that work. Of these\r\n  difficulties the philosophies of Berkeley and Hume are systematic\r\n  treatments. In Berkeley we find the resolute determination to accept\r\n  only the one notion, that of mind as restricted to its own conscious\r\n  experience, and to attempt by this means to explain the nature of the\r\n  external reality to which obscure reference is made. Any success in\r\n  the attempt is due only to the fact that Berkeley introduces alongside\r\n  of his individualist notion a totally new conception, that of mind\r\n  itself as not in the same way one of the matters of conscious\r\n  experience, but as capable of reflection upon the whole of experience\r\n  and of reference to the supreme mind as the ground of all reality. It\r\n  is only in Hume that we have definitely and completely the evolution\r\n  of the individualist notion as groundwork of a theory of knowledge;\r\n  and it is in his writings, therefore, that we may expect to find the\r\n  fundamental difficulty of that notion clearly apparent. It is not a\r\n  little remarkable that we should find in Hume, not only the sceptical\r\n  dissolution of all fixity of cognition, which is the inevitable result\r\n  of the individualist method, but also the clearest consciousness of\r\n  the very root of the difficulty. The systematic application of the\r\n  doctrine that conscious experience consists only of isolated objects\r\n  of knowledge, impressions or ideas, leads Hume to distinguish between\r\n  truths reached by analysis and truths which involve real connexion of\r\n  the objects of knowledge. The first he is willing to accept without\r\n  further inquiry, though it is an error to suppose, as Kant seems to\r\n  have supposed, that he regarded mathematical propositions as coming\r\n  under this head (see HUME); with respect to the second, he finds\r\n  himself, and confesses that he finds himself, hopelessly at fault. No\r\n  real connexions between isolated objects of experience are perceived\r\n  by us. No single matter of fact necessarily implies the existence of\r\n  any other. In short, if the difficulty be put in its ultimate form, no\r\n  existence thought as a distinct individual can transcend itself, or\r\n  imply relation to any other existence. If the parts of conscious\r\n  experience are regarded as so many distinct things, there is no\r\n  possibility of connecting them other than contingently, if at all. If\r\n  the individual mind be really thought as individual, it is impossible\r\n  to explain how it should have knowledge or consciousness at all. \"In\r\n  short,\" says Hume, \"there are two principles which I cannot render\r\n  consistent, nor is it in my power to renounce either of them, viz.\r\n  _that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences, and that\r\n  the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct\r\n  existences_. Did our perceptions either inhere in something simple or\r\n  individual, or did the mind perceive some real connexion among them,\r\n  there would be no difficulty in the case\" (App. to _Treatise of Human\r\n  Nature_).\r\n\r\n  Thus, on the one hand, the individualist conception, when carried out\r\n  to its full extent, leads to the total negation of all real cognition.\r\n  If the real system of things, to which conscious experience has\r\n  reference, be regarded as standing in casual relation to this\r\n  experience there is no conceivable ground for the extension to reality\r\n  of the notions which somehow are involved in thought. The same result\r\n  is apparent, on the other hand, when we consider the theory of\r\n  knowledge implied in the Leibnitzian individualism. The metaphysical\r\n  conception of the monads, each of which is the universe _in nuce_,\r\n  presents insuperable difficulties when the connexion or\r\n  interdependence of the monads is in question, and these difficulties\r\n  obtrude themselves when the attempt is made to work out a consistent\r\n  doctrine of cognition. For the whole mass of cognisable fact, the\r\n  _mundus intelligibilis_, is contained _impliciter_ in each monad, and\r\n  the several modes of apprehension can only be regarded as so many\r\n  stages in the developing consciousness of the monad. Sense and\r\n  understanding, real connexion of facts and analysis of notions, are\r\n  not, therefore, distinct in kind, but differ only in degree. The same\r\n  fundamental axioms, the logical principles of identity and sufficient\r\n  reason, are applicable in explanation of all given propositions. It is\r\n  true that Leibnitz himself did not work out any complete doctrine of\r\n  knowledge, but in the hands of his successors the theory took definite\r\n  shape in the principle that the whole work of cognition is in essence\r\n  analytical. The process of analysis might be complete or incomplete.\r\n  For finite intelligences there was an inevitable incompleteness so far\r\n  as knowledge of matters of fact was concerned. In respect to them,\r\n  the final result was found in a series of irreducible notions or\r\n  categories, the _prima possibilia_, the analysis and elucidation of\r\n  which was specifically the business of philosophy or metaphysics.\r\n\r\n  It will be observed that, in the Leibnitzian as in the empirical\r\n  individualism, the fundamental notion is still that of the abstract\r\n  separation of the thinking subject from the materials of conscious\r\n  experience. From this separation arise all the difficulties in the\r\n  effort to develop the notion systematically, and in tracing the\r\n  history of Kant's philosophical progress we are able to discern the\r\n  gradual perception on his part that here was to be found the ultimate\r\n  cause of the perplexities which became apparent in considering the\r\n  subordinate doctrines of the system. The successive essays which have\r\n  already been enumerated as composing Kant's precritical work are not\r\n  to be regarded as so many imperfect sketches of the doctrines of the\r\n  _Kritik_, nor are we to look in them for anticipations of the critical\r\n  view. They are essentially tentative, and exhibit with unusual\r\n  clearness the manner in which the difficulties of a received theory\r\n  force on a wider and more comprehensive view. There can be no doubt\r\n  that some of the special features of the _Kritik_ are to be found in\r\n  these precritical essays, e.g. the doctrine of the _Aesthetik_ is\r\n  certainly foreshadowed in the _Dissertation_ of 1770; the _Kritik_,\r\n  however, is no patchwork, and what appears in the _Dissertation_ takes\r\n  an altogether new form when it is wrought into the more comprehensive\r\n  conception of the later treatise.\r\n\r\n  The particular problem which gave the occasion to the first of the\r\n  precritical writings is, in an imperfect or particular fashion, the\r\n  fundamental question to which the _Kritik_ is an answer. What is the\r\n  nature of the distinction between knowledge gained by analysis of\r\n  notions and knowledge of matters of fact? Kant seems never to have\r\n  been satisfied with the Wolffian identification of logical axioms and\r\n  of the principle of sufficient reason. The tract on the _False\r\n  Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures_, in which the view of\r\n  thought or reason as analytic is clearly expressed, closes with the\r\n  significant division of judgments into those which rest upon the\r\n  logical axioms of identity and contradiction and those for which no\r\n  logical ground can be shown. Such immediate or indemonstrable\r\n  judgments, it is said, abound in our experience. They are, in fact, as\r\n  Kant presently perceived, the foundations for all judgments regarding\r\n  real existence. It was impossible that the question regarding their\r\n  nature and legitimacy and their distinction from analytic judgments\r\n  should not present itself to him. The three tracts belonging to the\r\n  years 1763-1764 bring forward in the sharpest fashion the essential\r\n  opposition between the two classes of judgments. In the _Essay on\r\n  Negative Quantities_, the fundamental thought is the total distinction\r\n  in kind between logical opposition (the contradictoriness of notions,\r\n  which Kant always viewed as formed, definite products of thought) and\r\n  real opposition. For the one adequate explanation is found in the\r\n  logical axiom of analytical thinking; for the other no such\r\n  explanation is to be had. Logical ground and real ground are totally\r\n  distinct. \"I can understand perfectly well,\" says Kant, \"how a\r\n  consequence follows from its reason according to the law of identity,\r\n  since it is discoverable by mere analysis of the notion contained in\r\n  it.... But how something follows from another thing and not according\r\n  to the law of identity, this I should gladly have made clear to me....\r\n  How shall I comprehend that, since something is, something else should\r\n  be?\" Real things, in short, are distinct existences, and, as distinct,\r\n  not necessarily or logically connected in thought. \"I have,\" he\r\n  proceeds, \"reflected on the nature of our knowledge in relation to our\r\n  judgment of reason and consequent, and I intend to expound fully the\r\n  result of my reflections. It follows from them that the relation of a\r\n  real ground to that which is thereby posited or denied cannot be\r\n  expressed by a judgment but only by means of a notion, which by\r\n  analysis may certainly be reduced to yet simpler notions of real\r\n  grounds, but yet in such a way that the final resort of all our\r\n  cognition in this regard must be found in simple and irreducible\r\n  notions of real grounds, the relation of which to their consequents\r\n  cannot be made clear.\"\r\n\r\n  The striking similarity between Kant's expressions in this _Essay_ and\r\n  the remarks with which Hume introduces his analysis of the notion of\r\n  cause has led to the supposition that at this period of his\r\n  philosophical career Kant was definitely under the influence of the\r\n  earlier empirical thinker. Consideration of the whole passage is quite\r\n  sufficient to show the groundlessness of this supposition. The\r\n  difficulty with which Kant is presented was one arising inevitably\r\n  from reflection upon the Leibnitzian theory of knowledge, and the\r\n  solution does not in any way go beyond that theory. It is a solution,\r\n  in fact, which must have been impossible had the purport of Hume's\r\n  empirical doctrine been present to Kant's mind. He is here at the\r\n  point at which he remained for many years, accepting without any\r\n  criticism certain fundamental notions as required for real cognition.\r\n  His ideal of metaphysic is still that of complete analysis of given\r\n  notions. No glimmering of the further question, Whence come these\r\n  notions and with what right do we apply them in cognition? is yet\r\n  apparent. Any direct influence from Hume must be referred to a later\r\n  period in his career.\r\n\r\n  The prize essay _On the Principles of Natural Theology and Morals_\r\n  brings forward the same fundamental opposition--though in a special\r\n  form. Here, for the first time, appears definitely the distinction\r\n  between synthesis and analysis, and in the distinction is found the\r\n  reason for the superior certainty and clearness of mathematics as\r\n  opposed to philosophy. Mathematics, Kant thinks, proceeds\r\n  synthetically, for in it the notions are constructed. Metaphysics, on\r\n  the other hand, is analytical in method; in it the notions are given,\r\n  and by analysis they are cleared up. It is to be observed that the\r\n  description of mathematics as synthetic is not an anticipation of the\r\n  critical doctrine on the same subject. Kant does not, in this place,\r\n  raise the question as to the reason for assuming that the arbitrary\r\n  syntheses of mathematical construction have any reference to reality.\r\n  The deeper significance of synthesis has not yet become apparent.\r\n\r\n  In the _Only Possible Ground of Proof for the Existence of God_, the\r\n  argument, though largely Leibnitzian, advances one step farther\r\n  towards the ultimate inquiry. For there Kant states as precisely as in\r\n  the critique of speculative theology his fundamental doctrine that\r\n  real existence is not a predicate to be added in thought to the\r\n  conception of a possible subject. So far as subjective thought is\r\n  concerned, possibility, not real existence, is contained in any\r\n  judgment.\r\n\r\n  The year 1765 was marked by the publication of Leibnitz's posthumous\r\n  _Nouveaux Essais_, in which his theory of knowledge is more fully\r\n  stated than in any of his previous tracts. In all probability Kant\r\n  gave some attention to this work, though no special reference to it\r\n  occurs in his writings, and it may have assisted to give additional\r\n  precision to his doctrine. In the curious essay, _Dreams of a\r\n  Clairvoyant_, published 1766, he emphasizes his previously reached\r\n  conclusion that connexions of real fact are mediated in our thought by\r\n  ultimate notions, but adds that the significance and warrant for such\r\n  notions can be furnished only by experience. He is inclined,\r\n  therefore, to regard as the function of metaphysics the complete\r\n  statement of these ultimate, indemonstrable notions, and therefore the\r\n  determination of the limits to knowledge by their means. Even at this\r\n  point, where he approximates more closely to Hume than to any other\r\n  thinker, the difficulty raised by Hume does not seem to occur to him.\r\n  He still appears to think that experience does warrant the employment\r\n  of such notions, and when there is taken into account his\r\n  correspondence with Lambert during the next few years, one would be\r\n  inclined to say that the _Architektonik_ of the latter represents most\r\n  completely Kant's idea of philosophy.\r\n\r\n  On another side Kant had been shaking himself free from the principles\r\n  of the Leibnitzian philosophy. According to Leibnitz, space, the order\r\n  of coexisting things, resulted from the relations of monads to one\r\n  another. But Kant began to see that such a conception did not accord\r\n  with the manner in which we determine directions or positions in\r\n  space. In the curious little essay, _On the Ground of distinguishing\r\n  Particular Divisions in Space_, he pointed out that the idea of space\r\n  as a whole is not deducible from the experience of particular spaces,\r\n  or particular relations of objects in space, that we only cognize\r\n  relations in space by reference to space as a whole, and finally that\r\n  definite positions involve reference to space as a given whole.\r\n\r\n  The whole development of Kant's thought up to this point is\r\n  intelligible when regarded from the Leibnitzian point of view, with\r\n  which he started. There appears no reason to conclude that Hume at\r\n  this time exercised any direct influence. One may go still further,\r\n  and add that even in the _Dissertation_ of 1770, generally regarded as\r\n  more than foreshadowing the _Kritik_, the really critical question is\r\n  not involved. A brief notice of the contents of this tract will\r\n  suffice to show how far removed Kant yet was from the methods and\r\n  principles of the critical or transcendental philosophy. Sense and\r\n  understanding, according to the _Dissertation_, are the two sources of\r\n  knowledge. The objects of the one are things of sense or _phenomena_;\r\n  the objects of the other are _noumena_. These are absolutely distinct,\r\n  and are not to be regarded as differing only in degree. In _phenomena_\r\n  we distinguish _matter_, which is given by sense, and _form_, which is\r\n  the law of the order of sensations. Such form is twofold--the order of\r\n  space and time. Sensations formed by space and time compose the world\r\n  of appearance, and this when treated by the understanding, according\r\n  to logical rules, is _experience_. But the logical use of the\r\n  understanding is not its only use. Much more important is the _real_\r\n  use, by which are produced the pure notions whereby we think things as\r\n  they are. These pure notions are the laws of the operation of the\r\n  intellect; they are _leges intellectus_.\r\n\r\n  Apart, then, from the expanded treatment of space and time as\r\n  subjective forms, we find in the _Dissertation_ little more than the\r\n  very precise and definite formulation of the slowly growing opposition\r\n  to the Leibnitzian doctrines. That the pure intellectual notions\r\n  should be defended as springing from the nature of intellect is not\r\n  out of harmony with the statement of the _Traume eines Geistersehers_,\r\n  for there the pure notions were allowed to exist, but were not held to\r\n  have validity for actual things except on grounds of experience. Here\r\n  they are supposed to exist, dissevered from experience, and are\r\n  allowed validity as determinations of things in themselves.\r\n\r\n  The stage which Kant had now reached in his philosophical development\r\n  was one of great significance. The doctrine of knowledge expressed in\r\n  the _Dissertation_ was the final form which the Wolffian rationalism\r\n  could assume for him, and, though many of the elements of the _Kritik_\r\n  are contained therein, it was not really in advance of the Wolffian\r\n  theory. The doctrine of space and time as forms of sense-perception,\r\n  the reference of both space and time and the pure intellectual notions\r\n  to the laws of the activity of mind itself, the distinction between\r\n  sense and understanding as one of kind, not of degree, with the\r\n  correlative distinction between phenomena and noumena,--all of these\r\n  reappear, though changed and modified, in the _Kritik_. But, despite\r\n  this resemblance, it seems clear that, so far as the _Dissertation_ is\r\n  concerned, the way had only been prepared for the true critical\r\n  inquiry, and that the real import of Hume's sceptical problem had not\r\n  yet dawned upon Kant. From the manner, however, in which the doctrine\r\n  of knowledge had been stated in the _Dissertation_, the further\r\n  inquiry had been rendered inevitable. It had become quite impossible\r\n  for Kant to remain longer satisfied with the ambiguous position\r\n  assigned to a fundamental element of his doctrine of knowledge, the\r\n  so-called pure intellectual notions. Those notions, according to the\r\n  _Dissertation_, had no function save in relation to\r\n  things-in-themselves, i.e. to objects which are not directly or\r\n  immediately brought into relation to our faculty of cognition. They\r\n  did not serve as the connecting links of formed experience; on the\r\n  contrary, they were supposed to be absolutely dissevered from all\r\n  experience which was possible for intelligence like ours. In his\r\n  previous essays, Kant, while likewise maintaining that such pure,\r\n  irreducible notions existed, had asserted in general terms that they\r\n  applied to experience, and that their applicability or justification\r\n  rested on experience itself, but had not raised the question as to the\r\n  ground of such justification. Now, from another side, the supreme\r\n  difficulty was presented--how could such notions have application to\r\n  any objects whatsoever? For some time the correlative difficulty, how\r\n  _objects_ of sense-perception were possible, does not seem to have\r\n  suggested itself to Kant. In the _Dissertation_ sense-perception had\r\n  been taken as receptivity of representations of objects, and\r\n  experience as the product of the treatment of such representations by\r\n  the logical or analytical processes of understanding. Some traces of\r\n  this confused fashion of regarding sense-perceptions are left even in\r\n  the _Kritik_, specially perhaps in the _Aesthetik_, and they give rise\r\n  to much of the ambiguity which unfortunately attaches to the more\r\n  developed theory of cognition. So soon, however, as the critical\r\n  question was put, On what rests the reference of representations in us\r\n  to the object or thing? in other words, How do we come to have\r\n  knowledge of objects at all? it became apparent that the problem was\r\n  one of perfect generality, and applied, not only to cognition through\r\n  the pure notions, but to sense-perceptions likewise. It is in the\r\n  statement of this general problem that we find the new and\r\n  characteristic feature of Kant's work.\r\n\r\n  There is thus no reason to doubt the substantial accuracy of Kant's\r\n  reference to the particular occasion or cause of the critical inquiry.\r\n  Up to the stage indicated by the _Dissertation_ he had been\r\n  attempting, in various ways, to unite two radically divergent modes of\r\n  explaining cognition--that which would account for the content of\r\n  experience by reference to affection from things without us, and that\r\n  which viewed the intellect itself as somehow furnished with the means\r\n  of pure, rational cognition. He now discovered that Hume's sceptical\r\n  analysis of the notion of cause was really the treatment of one\r\n  typical or crucial instance of the much more general problem. If\r\n  experience, says Hume, consists solely of states of mind somehow given\r\n  to us, each of which exists as an effect, and therefore as distinct\r\n  from others, with what right do we make the common assumption that\r\n  parts of experience are necessarily connected? The only possible\r\n  answer, drawn from the premises laid down, must be that there is no\r\n  warrant for such an assumption. Necessity for thought, as Kant had\r\n  been willing to admit and as Hume also held, involves or implies\r\n  something more than is given in experience--for that which is given is\r\n  contingent--and rests upon an a priori or pure notion. But a priori\r\n  notions, did they exist, could have no claim to regulate experience.\r\n  Hume, therefore, for his part, rejected entirely the notion of cause\r\n  as being fictitious and delusive, and professed to account for the\r\n  habit of regarding experience as necessarily connected by reference to\r\n  arbitrarily formed custom of thinking. Experience, as given,\r\n  contingent material, had a certain uniformity, and recurring\r\n  uniformities generated in us the habit of regarding things as\r\n  necessarily connected. That such a resort to experience for\r\n  explanation could lead to no valid conclusion has been already noted\r\n  as evident to Hume himself.\r\n\r\n  The dogmatic or individualist conception of experience had thus proved\r\n  itself inadequate to the solution of Hume's difficulty regarding the\r\n  notion of cause,--a difficulty which Kant, erroneously, had thought to\r\n  be the only case contemplated by his predecessor. The perception of\r\n  its inadequacy in this respect, and the consequent generalization of\r\n  Hume's problem, are the essential features of the new critical method.\r\n  For Kant was now prepared to formulate his general inquiry in a\r\n  definite fashion. His long-continued reflection on the Wolffian\r\n  doctrine of knowledge had made clear to him that synthetic connexion,\r\n  the essence of real cognition, was not contained in the products of\r\n  thinking as a formal activity of mind operating on material otherwise\r\n  supplied. On the other hand, Hume's analysis enabled him to see that\r\n  synthetic connexion was not contained in experience regarded as given\r\n  material. Thus neither the formal nor the material aspect of conscious\r\n  experience, when regarded from the individualist point of view,\r\n  supplied any foundation for real knowledge, whether a priori or\r\n  empirical. An absolutely new conception of experience was necessary,\r\n  if the fact of cognition was to be explained at all, and the various\r\n  modes in which Kant expresses the business of his critical philosophy\r\n  were merely different fashions of stating the one ultimate problem,\r\n  differing according to the particular aspect of knowledge which he\r\n  happened to have in view. To inquire how synthetic a priori judgments\r\n  are possible, or how far cognition extends, or what worth attaches to\r\n  metaphysical propositions, is simply to ask, in a specific form, what\r\n  elements are necessarily involved in experience of which the subject\r\n  is conscious. How is it possible for the individual thinking subject\r\n  to connect together the parts of his experience in the mode we call\r\n  cognition?\r\n\r\n  The problem of the critical philosophy is, therefore, the complete\r\n  analysis of experience from the point of view of the conditions under\r\n  which such experience is possible for the conscious subject. The\r\n  central ideas are thus self-consciousness, as the supreme condition\r\n  under which experience is subjectively possible, and the manifold\r\n  details of experience as a varied and complex whole. The solution of\r\n  the problem demanded the utmost care in keeping the due balance\r\n  between these ideas; and it can hardly be said that Kant was perfectly\r\n  successful. He is frequently untrue to the more comprehensive\r\n  conception which dominates his work as a whole. The influence of his\r\n  previous philosophical training, nay, even the unconscious influence\r\n  of terminology, frequently induces in his statements a certain laxity\r\n  and want of clearness. He selects definitely for his starting point\r\n  neither the idea of self-consciousness nor the details of experience,\r\n  but in his actual procedure passes from one to the other, rarely, if\r\n  ever, taking into full consideration the weighty question of their\r\n  relation to one another. Above all, he is continuously under the\r\n  influence of the individualist notion which he had done so much to\r\n  explode. The conception of conscious experience, which is the net\r\n  result of the _Kritik_, is indefinitely profounder and richer than\r\n  that which had ruled the 18th century philosophizing, but for Kant\r\n  such experience still appears as somehow the arbitrary product of the\r\n  relation between the individual conscious subject and the realm of\r\n  real facts. When he is actually analysing the conditions of knowledge,\r\n  the influence of the individualist conception is not prominent; the\r\n  conditions are stated as quite general, as conditions of knowledge.\r\n  But so soon as the deeper, metaphysical problems present themselves,\r\n  the shadow of the old doctrine reappears. Knowledge is regarded as a\r\n  mechanical product, part furnished by the subject, part given to the\r\n  subject, and is thus viewed as mechanically divisible into a priori\r\n  and a posteriori, into pure and empirical, necessary and contingent.\r\n  The individual as an agent, conscious of universal moral law, is yet\r\n  regarded as in a measure opposed to experience, and the Kantian\r\n  ethical code remains purely formal. The ultimate relation between\r\n  intelligence and natural fact, expressed in the notion of end, is\r\n  thought as problematic or contingent. The difficulties or obscurities\r\n  of the Kantian system, of which the above are merely the more\r\n  prominent, may all be traced to the one source, the false or at least\r\n  inadequate idea of the individual. The more thorough explanation of\r\n  the relation between experience as critically conceived and the\r\n  individual subject was the problem left by Kant for his successors.\r\n\r\n  In any detailed exposition of the critical system it would be\r\n  requisite in the first place to state with some fullness the precise\r\n  nature of the problems immediately before Kant, and in the second\r\n  place to follow with some closeness the successive stages of the\r\n  system as presented in the three main works, the _Kritik of Pure\r\n  Reason_, the _Kritik of Practical Reason_ and the _Kritik of\r\n  Judgment_, with the more important of the minor works, the _Metaphysic\r\n  of Nature_ and the _Metaphysic of Ethics_. It would be necessary,\r\n  also, in any such expanded treatment, to bring out clearly the Kantian\r\n  classification of the philosophical sciences, and to indicate the\r\n  relation between the critical or transcendental investigation of the\r\n  several faculties and the more developed sciences to which that\r\n  investigation serves as introduction. As any detailed statement of the\r\n  critical system, however compressed, would be beyond the limits of the\r\n  present article, it is proposed here to select only the more salient\r\n  doctrines, and to point out in connexion with them what advance had\r\n  been effected by Kant, and what remained for subsequent efforts at\r\n  complete solution of the problems raised by him. Much that is of\r\n  interest and value must necessarily be omitted in any sketch of so\r\n  elaborate a system, and for all points of special interpretation\r\n  reference must needs be made to the many elaborate dissertations on or\r\n  about the Kantian philosophy.\r\n\r\n  The doctrine from which Kant starts in his critical or transcendental\r\n  investigation of knowledge is that to which the slow development of\r\n  his thought had led him. The essence of cognition or knowledge was a\r\n  synthetic act, an act of combining in thought the detached elements of\r\n  experience. Now synthesis was explicable neither by reference to pure\r\n  thought, the logical or elaborative faculty, which in Kant's view\r\n  remained analytic in function, nor by reference to the effects of\r\n  external real things upon our faculties of cognition. For, on the one\r\n  hand, analysis or logical treatment applied only to objects of\r\n  knowledge as already given in synthetic forms, and, on the other hand,\r\n  real things could yield only isolated effects and not the combination\r\n  of these effects in the forms of cognitive experience. If experience\r\n  is to be matter of knowledge for the conscious subject, it must be\r\n  regarded as the conjoint product of given material and synthetic\r\n  combination. Form and matter may indeed be regarded separably and\r\n  dealt with in isolation for purposes of critical inquiry, but in\r\n  experience they are necessarily and inseparably united. The problem of\r\n  the _Kritik_ thus becomes for Kant the complete statement of the\r\n  elements necessarily involved in synthesis, and of the subjective\r\n  processes by which these elements are realized in our individual\r\n  consciousness. He is not asking, with Locke, whence the details of\r\n  experience arise; he is not attempting a natural history of the growth\r\n  of experience in the individual mind; but he is endeavouring to state\r\n  exhaustively what conditions are necessarily involved in any fact of\r\n  knowledge, i.e. in any synthetic combination of parts of experience by\r\n  the conscious subject.\r\n\r\n  So far as the elements necessarily involved in conscious experience\r\n  are concerned, these may be enumerated briefly thus:--given data of\r\n  sense, inner or outer; the forms of perception, i.e. space and time;\r\n  the forms of thought, i.e. the categories; the ultimate condition of\r\n  knowledge, the identity of the pure ego or self. The ego or self is\r\n  the central unity in reference to which alone is any part of\r\n  experience cognizable. But the consciousness of self is the foundation\r\n  of knowledge only when related to given material. The ego has not in\r\n  itself the element of difference, and the essence of knowledge is the\r\n  consciousness of unity in difference. For knowledge, therefore, it is\r\n  necessary that difference should be _given_ to the ego. The modes\r\n  under which it is possible for such given difference to become portion\r\n  of the conscious experience of the ego, the modes under which the\r\n  isolated data can be synthetically combined so as to form a cognizable\r\n  whole, make up the form of cognition, and upon this form rests the\r\n  possibility of any a priori or rational knowledge.\r\n\r\n  The notion of the ego as a purely logical unity, containing in itself\r\n  no element of difference, and having only analytical identity, is\r\n  fundamental in the critical system, and lies at the root of all its\r\n  difficulties and perplexities. To say that the ego as an individual\r\n  does not _produce_ the world of experience is by no means the same as\r\n  to say that the ego is pure unity without element of difference. In\r\n  the one case we are treating the ego as one of the objects of\r\n  experience and denying of it productive efficacy; in the second case\r\n  we are dealing with the unity of the ego as a condition of knowledge,\r\n  of any experience whatsoever. In this second sense, it is wholly wrong\r\n  to assert that the ego is pure identity, pure unity. The unity and\r\n  identity of the ego, so regarded, are taken in abstraction, i.e. as\r\n  dissevered from the more complex whole of which they are necessary\r\n  elements. When the ego is taken as a condition of knowledge, its unity\r\n  is not more important than the difference necessarily correlated with\r\n  it. That the ego as a thing should not produce difference is quite\r\n  beside the mark. The consequences of the abstract separation which\r\n  Kant so draws between the ego and the world of experience are apparent\r\n  throughout his whole system. Assuming at the outset an opposition\r\n  between the two, self and matter of knowledge, he is driven by the\r\n  exigencies of the problem of reconciliation to insert term after term\r\n  as means of bringing them together, but never succeeds in attaining a\r\n  junction which is more than mechanical. To the end, the ego remains,\r\n  partly the pure logical ego, partly the concrete individual spirit,\r\n  and no explanation is afforded of the relation between them. It is for\r\n  this reason that the system of forms of perception and categories\r\n  appears so contingent and haphazard. No attempt is made to show how or\r\n  why the difference supplied for the pure logical ego should present\r\n  itself necessarily under these forms. They are regarded rather as\r\n  portions of the subjective mechanism of the individual consciousness.\r\n  The mind or self appears as though it were endowed with a complex\r\n  machinery by which alone it could act upon the material supplied to\r\n  it. Such a crude conception is far, indeed, from doing justice to\r\n  Kant's view, but it undoubtedly represents the underlying assumption\r\n  of many of his cardinal doctrines. The philosophy of Fichte is\r\n  historically interesting as that in which the deficiencies of Kant's\r\n  fundamental position were first discerned and the attempt made to\r\n  remedy them.\r\n\r\n  Unfortunately for the consistency of the _Kritik_, Kant does not\r\n  attempt to work out systematically the elements involved in knowledge\r\n  before considering the subjective processes by which knowledge is\r\n  realized in consciousness. He mixes up the two inquiries, and in the\r\n  general division of his work depends rather upon the results of\r\n  previous psychology than upon the lines prescribed by his own new\r\n  conception of experience. He treats the elements of cognition\r\n  separately in connexion with the several subjective processes involved\r\n  in knowledge, viz. sense and understanding. Great ambiguity is the\r\n  natural result of this procedure. For it was not possible for Kant to\r\n  avoid the misleading connotation of the terms employed by him. In\r\n  strictness, sense, understanding, imagination and reason ought to have\r\n  had their functions defined in close relation to the elements of\r\n  knowledge with which they are severally connected, and as these\r\n  elements have no existence as separate facts, but only as factors in\r\n  the complex organic whole, it might have been possible to avoid the\r\n  error of supposing that each subjective process furnished a distinct,\r\n  separately cognizable portion of a mechanical whole. But the use of\r\n  separate terms, such as sense and understanding, almost unavoidably\r\n  led to phraseology only interpretable as signifying that each\r\n  furnished a specific kind of knowledge, and all Kant's previous\r\n  training contributed to strengthen this erroneous view. Especially\r\n  noteworthy is this in the case of the categories. Kant insists upon\r\n  treating these as _Begriffe_, notions, and assigns to them certain\r\n  characteristics of notions. But it is readily seen, and in the _Logik_\r\n  Kant shows himself fully aware of the fact, that these pure connective\r\n  links of experience, general aspects of objects of intelligible\r\n  experience, do not resemble concepts formed by the so-called logical\r\n  or elaborative processes from representations of completed objects.\r\n  Nothing but harm can follow from any attempt to identify two products\r\n  which differ so entirely. So, again, the _Aesthetik_ is rendered\r\n  extremely obscure and difficult by the prevalence of the view, already\r\n  noted as obtaining in the _Dissertation_, that sense is a faculty\r\n  receiving representations of objects. Kant was anxious to avoid the\r\n  error of Leibnitz, who had taken sense and understanding to differ in\r\n  degree only, not in kind; but in avoiding the one error he fell into\r\n  another of no less importance.\r\n\r\n  The consideration of the several elements which in combination make up\r\n  the fact of cognition, or perception, as it may be called, contains\r\n  little or nothing bearing on the origin and nature of the given data\r\n  of sense, inner or outer. The manifold of sense, which plays so\r\n  important a part in the critical theory of knowledge, is left in an\r\n  obscure and perplexed position. So much is clear, however, that\r\n  according to Kant sense is not to be regarded as receptive of\r\n  representations of objects. The data of sense are mere _stimuli_, not\r\n  partial or confused representations. The sense-manifold is not to be\r\n  conceived as having, _per se_, any of the qualities of objects as\r\n  actually cognized; its parts are not cognizable _per se_, nor can it\r\n  with propriety be said to be received successively or simultaneously.\r\n  When we apply predicates to the sense-manifold regarded in isolation,\r\n  we make that which is only a factor in the experience of objects into\r\n  a separate, independent object, and use our predicates transcendently.\r\n  Kant is not always in his language faithful to his view of the\r\n  sense-manifold, but the theory as a whole, together with his own\r\n  express definitions, is unmistakable. On the origin of the data of\r\n  sense, Kant's remarks are few and little satisfactory. He very\r\n  commonly employs the term _affection_ of the faculty of sense as\r\n  expressing the mode of origin, but offers no further explanation of a\r\n  term which has significance only when interpreted after a somewhat\r\n  mechanical fashion. Unquestionably certain of his remarks indicate the\r\n  view that the origin is to be sought in things-in-themselves, but\r\n  against hasty misinterpretations of such remarks there are certain\r\n  cautions to be borne in mind. The relation between phenomena and\r\n  noumena in the Kantian system does not in the least resemble that\r\n  which plays so important a part in modern psychology--between the\r\n  subjective results of sense affection and the character of the\r\n  objective conditions of such affection. Kant has pointedly declared\r\n  that it would be a gross absurdity to suppose that in his view\r\n  separate, distinct things-in-themselves existed corresponding to the\r\n  several objects of perception. And, finally, it is not at all\r\n  difficult to understand why Kant should say that the affection of\r\n  sense originated in the action of things-in-themselves, when we\r\n  consider what was the thing-in-itself to which he was referring. The\r\n  thing-in-itself to which the empirical order and relations of\r\n  sense-experience are referred is the divine order, which is not matter\r\n  of knowledge, but involved in our practical or moral beliefs. Critics\r\n  who limit their view to the _Kritik of Pure Reason_, and there, in all\r\n  probability, to the first or constructive portion of the work, must\r\n  necessarily fail to interpret the doctrines of the Kantian system,\r\n  which do not become clear or definite till the system has been\r\n  developed. Reason was, for Kant, an organic whole; the speculative and\r\n  moral aspects are never severed; and the solution of problems which\r\n  appear at first sight to belong solely to the region of speculative\r\n  thought may be found ultimately to depend upon certain characteristics\r\n  of our nature as practical.\r\n\r\n  Data of sense-affection do not contain in themselves synthetic\r\n  combination. The first conditions of such combination are found by\r\n  Kant in the universal forms under which alone sense-phenomena manifest\r\n  themselves in experience. These universal forms of perception, space\r\n  and time, are necessary, a priori, and in characteristic features\r\n  resembling intuitions, not notions. They occupy, therefore, a peculiar\r\n  position, and one section of the _Kritik_, the _Aesthetik_, is\r\n  entirely devoted to the consideration of them. It is important to\r\n  observe that it is only through the a priori character of these\r\n  perceptive forms that rational science of nature is at all possible.\r\n  Kant is here able to resume, with fresh insight, his previous\r\n  discussions regarding the synthetic character of mathematical\r\n  propositions. In his early essays he had rightly drawn the distinction\r\n  between mathematical demonstration and philosophic proof, referring\r\n  the certainty of the first to the fact that the constructions were\r\n  synthetic in character and entirely determined by the action of\r\n  constructive imagination. It had not then occurred to him to ask, With\r\n  what right do we assume that the conclusions arrived at from arbitrary\r\n  constructions in mathematical matter have applicability to objects of\r\n  experience? Might not mathematics be a purely imaginary science? To\r\n  this question he is now enabled to return an answer. Space and time,\r\n  the two essential conditions of sense-perception, are not data given\r\n  by things, but universal forms of intellect into which all data of\r\n  sense must be received. Hence, whatever is true of space and time\r\n  regarded by imagination as objects, i.e. quantitative constructions,\r\n  must be true of the objects making up our sense-experience. The same\r\n  forms and the same constructive activity of imagination are involved\r\n  in mathematical synthesis and in the constitution of objects of\r\n  sense-experience. The foundation for pure or rational mathematics,\r\n  there being included under this the pure science of movement, is thus\r\n  laid in the critical doctrine of space and time.\r\n\r\n  The _Aesthetik_ isolates sense-perception, and considers its forms as\r\n  though it were an independent, complete faculty. A certain confusion,\r\n  arising from this, is noticeable in the _Analytik_ when the necessity\r\n  for justifying the position of the categories is under discussion, but\r\n  the real difficulty in which Kant was involved by his doctrine of\r\n  space and time has its roots even deeper than the erroneous isolation\r\n  of sensibility. He has not in any way \"deduced\" space and time, but,\r\n  proceeding from the ordinary current view of sense-experience, has\r\n  found these remaining as residuum after analysis. The relation in\r\n  which they stand to the categories or pure notions is ambiguous; and,\r\n  when Kant has to consider the fashion in which category and data of\r\n  sense are to be brought together, he merely places side by side as a\r\n  priori elements the pure connective notions and the pure forms of\r\n  perception, and finds it, apparently, only a matter of contingent\r\n  convenience that they should harmonize with one another and so render\r\n  cognition possible. To this point also Fichte was the first to call\r\n  attention.\r\n\r\n  Affection of sense, even when received into the pure forms of\r\n  perception, is not matter of knowledge. For cognition there is\r\n  requisite synthetic combination, and the intellectual function through\r\n  which such combination takes place. The forms of intellectual function\r\n  Kant proceeds to enumerate with the aid of the commonly received\r\n  logical doctrines. For this reference to logic he has been severely\r\n  blamed, but the precise nature of the debt due to the commonly\r\n  accepted logical classification is very generally misconceived.\r\n  Synthetic combination, Kant points out, is formally expressed in a\r\n  judgment, which is the act of uniting representations. At the\r\n  foundation of the judgments which express the types of synthetic\r\n  combination, through which knowledge is possible, lie the pure general\r\n  notions, the abstract aspect of the conditions under which objects are\r\n  cognizable in experience. General logic has also to deal with the\r\n  union of representations, though its unity is analytic merely, not\r\n  synthetic. But the same intellectual function which serves to give\r\n  unity in the analytic judgments of formal logic serves to give unity\r\n  to the synthetic combinations of real perception. It appeared evident,\r\n  then, to Kant that in the forms of judgment, as they are stated in the\r\n  common logic, there must be found the analogues of the types of\r\n  judgment which are involved in transcendental logic, or in the theory\r\n  of real cognition. His view of the ordinary logic was wide and\r\n  comprehensive, though in his restriction of the science to pure form\r\n  one can trace the influence of his earlier training, and it is no\r\n  small part of the value of the critical philosophy that it has revived\r\n  the study of logic and prepared the way for a more thorough\r\n  consideration of logical doctrines. The position assigned to logic by\r\n  Kant is not, in all probability, one which can be defended; indeed, it\r\n  is hard to see how Kant himself, in consistency with the critical\r\n  doctrine of knowledge, could have retained many of the older logical\r\n  theorems, but the precision with which the position was stated, and\r\n  the sharpness with which logic was marked off from cognate philosophic\r\n  disciplines, prepared the way for the more thoughtful treatment of the\r\n  whole question.\r\n\r\n  Formal logic thus yields to Kant the list of the general notions, pure\r\n  intellectual predicates, or categories, through which alone experience\r\n  is possible for a conscious subject. It has already been noted how\r\n  serious was the error involved in the description of these as notions,\r\n  without further attempt to clear up their precise significance. Kant,\r\n  indeed, was mainly influenced by his strong opposition to the\r\n  Leibnitzian rationalism, and therefore assigns the categories to\r\n  understanding, the logical faculty, without consideration of the\r\n  question,--which might have been suggested by the previous statements\r\n  of the _Dissertation_,--what relation these categories held to the\r\n  empirical notions formed by comparison, abstraction and generalization\r\n  when directed upon representations of objects. But when the categories\r\n  are described as notions, i.e. formed products of thought, there rises\r\n  of necessity the problem which had presented itself to Kant at every\r\n  stage of his precritical thinking,--with what right can we assume that\r\n  these notions apply to objects of experience? The answer which he\r\n  proceeds to give altogether explodes the definition of the categories\r\n  as formed products of thought, and enables us to see more clearly the\r\n  nature of the new conception of experience which lies in the\r\n  background of all the critical work.\r\n\r\n  The unity of the ego, which has been already noted as an element\r\n  entering into the synthesis of cognition, is a unity of a quite\r\n  distinct and peculiar kind. That the ego to which different parts of\r\n  experience are presented must be the same ego, if there is to be\r\n  cognition at all, is analytically evident; but the peculiarity is that\r\n  the ego must be conscious of its own unity and identity, and this\r\n  unity of self-consciousness is only possible in relation to difference\r\n  not contained in the ego but given to it. The unity of apperception,\r\n  then, as Kant calls it, is only possible in relation to synthetic\r\n  unity of experience itself, and the forms of this synthetic unity, the\r\n  categories, are, therefore, on the one hand, necessary as forms in\r\n  which self-consciousness is realized, and, on the other hand,\r\n  restricted in their application and validity to the data of given\r\n  sense, or the particular element of experience. Thus experience\r\n  presents itself as the organic combination of the particular of sense\r\n  with the individual unity of the ego through the universal forms of\r\n  the categories. Reference of representations to the unity of the\r\n  object, synthetic unity of apperception, and subsumption of data of\r\n  sense under the categories, are thus three sides or aspects of the one\r\n  fundamental fact.\r\n\r\n  In this deduction of the categories, as Kant calls it, there appears\r\n  for the first time an endeavour to connect together into one organic\r\n  whole the several elements entering into experience. It is evident,\r\n  however, that much was wanting before this essential task could be\r\n  regarded as complete. Kant has certainly brought together\r\n  self-consciousness, the system of the categories and data of sense. He\r\n  has shown that the conditions of self-consciousness are the conditions\r\n  of possible experience. But he has not shown, nor did he attempt to\r\n  show, how it was that the conditions of self-consciousness are the\r\n  very categories arrived at by consideration of the system of logical\r\n  judgments. He does endeavour to show, but with small success, how the\r\n  junction of category and data of sense is brought about, for according\r\n  to his scheme these stood, to a certain extent at least, apart from\r\n  and independent of one another. The failure to effect an organic\r\n  combination of the several elements was the natural consequence of the\r\n  false start which had been made.\r\n\r\n  The mode in which Kant endeavours to show how the several portions of\r\n  cognition are subjectively realized brings into the clearest light the\r\n  inconsistencies and imperfections of his doctrine. Sense had been\r\n  assumed as furnishing the particular of knowledge, understanding as\r\n  furnishing the universal; and it had been expressly declared that the\r\n  particular was cognizable only in and through the universal. Still,\r\n  each was conceived as somehow in itself complete and finished. Sense\r\n  and understanding had distinct functions, and there was wanting some\r\n  common term, some intermediary which should bring them into\r\n  conjunction. Data of sense as purely particular could have nothing in\r\n  common with the categories as purely universal. But data of sense had\r\n  at least one universal aspect,--their aspect as the particular of the\r\n  general forms, space and time. Categories were in themselves abstract\r\n  and valueless, serviceable only when restricted to possible objects of\r\n  experience. There was thus a common ground on which category and\r\n  intuition were united in one, and an intermediate process whereby the\r\n  universal of the category might be so far individualized as to\r\n  comprehend the particular of sense. This intermediate process--which\r\n  is really the junction of understanding and sense--Kant calls\r\n  productive imagination, and it is only through productive imagination\r\n  that knowledge or experience is actually realized in our subjective\r\n  consciousness. The specific forms of productive imagination are called\r\n  _schemata_, and upon the nature of the schema Kant gives much that has\r\n  proved of extreme value for subsequent thought.\r\n\r\n  Productive imagination is thus the concrete element of knowledge, and\r\n  its general modes are the abstract expression of the a priori laws of\r\n  all possible experience. The categories are restricted in their\r\n  applicability to the schema, i.e. to the pure forms of conjunction of\r\n  the manifold in time, and in the modes of combination of schemata and\r\n  categories we have the foundation for the rational sciences of\r\n  mathematics and physics. Perception or real cognition is thus\r\n  conceived as a complex fact, involving data of sense and pure\r\n  perceptive forms, determined by the category and realized through\r\n  productive imagination in the schema. The system of principles which\r\n  may be deduced from the consideration of the mode in which\r\n  understanding and sense are united by productive imagination is the\r\n  positive result of the critical theory of knowledge, and some of its\r\n  features are remarkable enough to deserve attention. According to his\r\n  usual plan, Kant arranges these principles in conformity with the\r\n  table of the categories, dividing the four classes, however, into two\r\n  main groups, the mathematical and the dynamical. The mathematical\r\n  principles are the abstract expression of the necessary mode in which\r\n  data of sense are determined by the category in the form of intuitions\r\n  or representations of objects; the dynamical are the abstract\r\n  expression of the modes in which the existence of objects of intuition\r\n  is determined. The mathematical principles are constitutive, i.e.\r\n  express determinations of the objects themselves; the dynamical are\r\n  regulative, i.e. express the conditions under which objects can form\r\n  parts of real experience. Under the mathematical principles come the\r\n  general rules which furnish the ground for the application of\r\n  quantitative reasoning to real facts of experience. For as data of\r\n  sense are only possible objects when received in the forms of space\r\n  and time, and as space and time are only cognized when determined in\r\n  definite fashion by the understanding through the schema of number\r\n  (quantity) or degree (quality), all intuitions are extensive\r\n  quantities and contain a real element, that of sense, which has\r\n  degree. Under the dynamical principles, the general modes in which the\r\n  existence of objects are determined, fall the analogies of experience,\r\n  or general rules according to which the existence of objects in\r\n  relation to one another can be determined, and the postulates of\r\n  experience, the general rules according to which the existence of\r\n  objects for us or our own subjective existence can be determined. The\r\n  analogies of experience rest upon the order of perceptions in time,\r\n  i.e. their permanence, succession or coexistence, and the principles\r\n  are respectively those of substance, causality and reciprocity. It is\r\n  to be observed that Kant in the expression of these analogies reaches\r\n  the final solution of the difficulty which had so long pressed upon\r\n  him, the difficulty as to the relation of the pure connective notions\r\n  to experience. These notions are not directly applicable to\r\n  experience, nor do we find in experience anything corresponding to the\r\n  pure intellectual notions of substance, cause and reciprocity. But\r\n  experience is for us the combination of data of sense in the forms of\r\n  productive imagination, forms determined by the pure intellectual\r\n  notions, and accordingly experience is possible for us only as in\r\n  modes corresponding to the notions. The permanent in time is substance\r\n  in any possible experience, and no experience is possible save through\r\n  the determination of all changes as in relation to a permanent in\r\n  time. Determined sequence is the causal relation in any possible\r\n  experience, and no experience is possible save through the\r\n  determination of perceived changes as in relation to a determined\r\n  order in time. So with coexistence and reciprocity.\r\n\r\n  The postulates of experience are general expressions of the\r\n  significance of existence in the experience of a conscious subject.\r\n  The element of reality in such experience must always be given by\r\n  intuition, and, so far as determination of existence is assumed,\r\n  external intuition is a necessary condition of inner intuition. The\r\n  existence of external things is as certain as the existence of the\r\n  concrete subject, and the subject cannot cognise himself as existing\r\n  save in relation to the world of facts of external perception. Inner\r\n  and outer reality are strictly correlative elements in the experience\r\n  of the conscious subject.\r\n\r\n  Throughout the positive portion of his theory of cognition, Kant has\r\n  been beset by the doctrine that the categories, as finished, complete\r\n  notions, have an import or significance transcending the bounds of\r\n  possible experience. Morever, the manner in which space and time had\r\n  been treated made it possible for him to regard these as contingent\r\n  forms, necessary for intelligences like ours, but not to be viewed as\r\n  absolutely necessary. The real meaning of these peculiarities is\r\n  hardly ever expressed by him, though it is clear that the solution of\r\n  the matter is to be found in the inadequacy of the positive theory to\r\n  meet the demands of reason for completed explanation. But the\r\n  conclusion to which he was led was one of the greatest importance for\r\n  the after development of his system. Cognition is necessarily limited.\r\n  The categories are restricted in their application to elements of\r\n  possible experience to that which is presented in intuition, and all\r\n  intuition is for the ego contingent. But to assert that cognition is\r\n  limited and its matter contingent is to form the idea of an\r\n  intelligence for whom cognition would not be limited and for whom the\r\n  data of intuition would not be given, contingent facts, but\r\n  necessarily produced along with the pure categories. This idea of an\r\n  intuitive understanding is the definite expression for the complete\r\n  explanation which reason demands, and it involves the conception of a\r\n  realm of objects for such an understanding, a realm of objects which,\r\n  in opposition to the _phenomena_ of our relative and limited\r\n  experience, may be called _noumena_ or things-in-themselves. The\r\n  _noumenon_, therefore, is in one way the object of a non-sensuous\r\n  intuition, but more correctly is the expression of the limited and\r\n  partial character of our knowledge. The idea of a noumenon is thus a\r\n  limiting notion.\r\n\r\n  Assuredly, the difficult section of the _Kritik_, on the ground of the\r\n  distinction between phenomena and noumena, would not have led to so\r\n  much misconception as it has done, had Kant then brought forward what\r\n  lies at the root of the distinction, his doctrine of reason and its\r\n  functions. Understanding, as has been seen, is the faculty of\r\n  cognition strictly so called; and within its realm, that of space,\r\n  time and matter, positive knowledge is attainable. But the ultimate\r\n  conception of understanding, that of the world of objects,\r\n  quantitatively determined, and standing in relation of mutual\r\n  reciprocity to one another, is not a final ground of explanation. We\r\n  are still able and necessitated to reflect upon the whole world of\r\n  phenomena as thus cognized, and driven to inquire after its\r\n  significance. In our reflection we necessarily treat the objects, not\r\n  as phenomena, as matters of positive, scientific knowledge, but as\r\n  things-in-themselves, as noumena. The distinction between phenomena\r\n  and noumena is, therefore, nothing but the expression of the\r\n  distinction between understanding and reason, a distinction which,\r\n  according to Kant, is merely subjective.\r\n\r\n  The specific function of reason is the effort after completed\r\n  explanation of the experience presented in cognition. But in such\r\n  effort there are no notions to be employed other than the categories,\r\n  and these, as has already been seen, have validity only in reference\r\n  to objects of possible experience. We may expect, then, to find the\r\n  transcendent employment of the categories leading into various\r\n  difficulties and inconsistencies. The criticism of reason in its\r\n  specific aspect throws fresh light on the limits to human knowledge\r\n  and the significance of experience.\r\n\r\n  Experience has presented itself as the complex result of relation\r\n  between the ego or subject and the world of phenomena. Reason may\r\n  therefore attempt a completed explanation either of the ego or of the\r\n  world of phenomena or of the total relation between them. The three\r\n  inquiries correspond to the subjects of the three ancient metaphysical\r\n  sciences, rational psychology, rational cosmology, rational theology.\r\n  It is readily seen, in regard to the first of them, that all attempts\r\n  to determine the nature of the ego as a simple, perdurable, immaterial\r\n  substance rest upon a confusion between the ego as pure logical unity\r\n  and the ego as object of intuition, and involve a transcendent use of\r\n  the categories of experience. It profits not to apply such categories\r\n  to the soul, for no intuition corresponding to them is or can be\r\n  given. The idea of the soul must be regarded as transcendent. So too\r\n  when we endeavour, with the help of the categories of quantity,\r\n  quality, relation and modality, to determine the nature and relation\r\n  of parts of the world, we find that reason is landed in a peculiar\r\n  difficulty. Any solution that can be given is too narrow for the\r\n  demands of reason and too wide for the restrictions of understanding.\r\n  The transcendent employment of the categories leads to antinomy, or\r\n  equally balanced statements of apparently contradictory results. Due\r\n  attention to the relation between understanding and reason enables us\r\n  to solve the antinomies and to discover their precise origin and\r\n  significance. Finally, the endeavour to find in the conception of God,\r\n  as the supreme reality, the explanation of experience, is seen to lead\r\n  to no valid conclusion. There is not any intuition given whereby we\r\n  might show the reality of our idea of a Supreme Being. So far as\r\n  knowledge is concerned, God remains a transcendental ideal.\r\n\r\n  The criticism of the transcendental ideas, which is also the\r\n  examination of the claims of metaphysic to rank as a science, yields a\r\n  definite and intelligible result. These ideas, the expression of the\r\n  various modes in which unity of reason may be sought, have no objects\r\n  corresponding to them in the sphere of cognition. They have not,\r\n  therefore, like the categories, any _constitutive_ value, and all\r\n  attempts at metaphysical construction with the notions or categories\r\n  of science must be resigned as of necessity hopeless. But the ideas\r\n  are not, on that account, destitute of all value. They are supremely\r\n  significant, as indicating the very essence of the function of reason.\r\n  The limits of scientific cognition become intelligible, only when the\r\n  sphere of understanding is subjected to critical reflexion and\r\n  compared with the possible sphere of reason, that is, the sphere of\r\n  rationally complete cognition. The ideas, therefore, in relation to\r\n  knowledge strictly so called, have _regulative_ value, for they\r\n  furnish the general precepts for extension and completion of\r\n  knowledge, and, at the same time, since they spring from reason\r\n  itself, they have a real value in relation to reason as the very\r\n  inmost nature of intelligence. Self-consciousness cannot be regarded\r\n  as merely a mechanically determined result. Free reflection upon the\r\n  whole system of knowledge is sufficient to indicate that the sphere of\r\n  intuition, with its rational principles, does not exhaust conscious\r\n  experience. There still remains, over and above the realm of nature,\r\n  the realm of free, self-conscious spirit; and, within this sphere, it\r\n  may be anticipated that the ideas will acquire a significance richer\r\n  and deeper than the merely regulative import which they possess in\r\n  reference to cognition.\r\n\r\n  Where, then, are we to look for this realm of free self-consciousness?\r\n  Not in the sphere of cognition, where objects are mechanically\r\n  determined, but in that of will or of reason as practical. That reason\r\n  is practical or prescribes ends for itself is sufficiently manifest\r\n  from the mere fact of the existence of the conception of morality or\r\n  duty, a conception which can have no corresponding object within the\r\n  sphere of intuition, and which is theoretically, or in accordance with\r\n  the categories of understanding, incognizable. The presence of this\r\n  conception is the datum upon which may be founded a special\r\n  investigation of the conditions of reason as practical, a _Kritik_ of\r\n  pure practical reason, and the analysis of it yields the statement of\r\n  the formal prescripts of morality.\r\n\r\n  The realization of duty is impossible for any being which is not\r\n  thought as free, i.e. capable of self-determination. Freedom, it is\r\n  true, is theoretically not an object of cognition, but its\r\n  impossibility is not thereby demonstrated. The theoretical proof\r\n  rather serves as useful aid towards the more exact determination of\r\n  the nature and province of self-determination, and of its relation to\r\n  the whole concrete nature of humanity. For in man self-determination\r\n  and mechanical determination by empirical motives coexist, and only in\r\n  so far as he belongs and is conscious of belonging both to the sphere\r\n  of sense and to the sphere of reason does moral obligation become\r\n  possible for him. The supreme end prescribed by reason in its\r\n  practical aspect, namely, the complete subordination of the empirical\r\n  side of nature to the prescripts of morality, demands, as conditions\r\n  of its possible realization, the permanence of ethical progress in the\r\n  moral agent, the certainty of freedom in self-determination, and the\r\n  necessary harmonizing of the spheres of sense and reason through the\r\n  intelligent author or ground of both. These conditions, the postulates\r\n  of practical reason, are the concrete expressions of the three\r\n  transcendental ideas, and in them we have the full significance of the\r\n  ideas for reason. Immortality of the soul, positive freedom of will,\r\n  and the existence of an intelligent ground of things are speculative\r\n  ideas practically warranted, though theoretically neither demonstrable\r\n  nor comprehensible.\r\n\r\n  Thus reason as self-determining supplies notions of freedom; reason as\r\n  determined supplies categories of understanding. Union between the two\r\n  spheres, which seem at first sight disparate, is found in the\r\n  necessary postulate that reason shall be realized, for its realization\r\n  is only possible in the sphere of sense. But such a union, when\r\n  regarded _in abstracto_, rests upon, or involves, a notion of quite a\r\n  new order, that of the adaptation of nature to reason, or, as it may\r\n  be expressed, that of end in nature. Understanding and reason thus\r\n  coalesce in the faculty of _judgment_, which mediates between, or\r\n  brings together, the universal and particular elements in conscious\r\n  experience. Judgment is here merely _reflective_; that is to say, the\r\n  particular element is given, so determined as to be possible material\r\n  of knowledge, while the universal, not necessary for cognition, is\r\n  supplied by reason itself. The empirical details of nature, which are\r\n  not determined by the categories of understanding, are judged as being\r\n  arranged or ordered by intelligence, for in no other fashion could\r\n  nature, in its particular, contingent aspect, be thought as forming a\r\n  complete, consistent, intelligible whole.\r\n\r\n  The investigation of the conditions under which adaptation of nature\r\n  to intelligence is conceivable and possible makes up the subject of\r\n  the third great _Kritik_, the _Kritik of Judgment_, a work presenting\r\n  unusual difficulties to the interpreter of the Kantian system. The\r\n  general principle of the adaptation of nature to our faculties of\r\n  cognition has two specific applications, with the second of which it\r\n  is more closely connected than with the first. In the first place, the\r\n  adaptation may be merely _subjective_, when the empirical condition\r\n  for the exercise of judgment is furnished by the feeling of pleasure\r\n  or pain; such adaptation is aesthetic. In the second place, the\r\n  adaptation may be objective or logical, when empirical facts are given\r\n  of such a kind that their possibility can be conceived only through\r\n  the notion of the end realized in them; such adaptation is\r\n  teleological, and the empirical facts in question are organisms.\r\n\r\n  Aesthetics, or the scientific consideration of the judgments resting\r\n  on the feelings of pleasure and pain arising from the harmony or want\r\n  of harmony between the particular of experience and the laws of\r\n  understanding, is the special subject of the _Kritik of Judgment_, but\r\n  the doctrine of teleology there unfolded is the more important for the\r\n  complete view of the critical system. For the analysis of the\r\n  teleological judgment and of the consequences flowing from it leads to\r\n  the final statement of the nature of experience as conceived by Kant.\r\n  The phenomena of organic production furnish data for a special kind of\r\n  judgment, which, however, involves or rests upon a quite general\r\n  principle, that of the contingency of the particular element in nature\r\n  and its subjectively necessary adaptation to our faculty of cognition.\r\n  The notion of contingency arises, according to Kant, from the fact\r\n  that understanding and sense are distinct, that understanding does not\r\n  determine the particular of sense, and, consequently, that the\r\n  principle of the adaptation of the particular to our understanding is\r\n  merely supplied by reason on account of the peculiarity or limited\r\n  character of understanding. End in nature, therefore, is a subjective\r\n  or problematic conception, implying the limits of understanding, and\r\n  consequently resting upon the idea of an understanding constituted\r\n  unlike ours--of an intuitive understanding in which particular and\r\n  universal should be given together. The idea of such an understanding\r\n  is, for cognition, transcendent, for no corresponding fact of\r\n  intuition is furnished, but it is realized with practical certainty in\r\n  relation to reason as practical. For we are, from practical grounds,\r\n  compelled with at least practical necessity to ascribe a certain aim\r\n  or end to this supreme understanding. The moral law, or reason as\r\n  practical, prescribes the realization of the highest good, and such\r\n  realization implies a higher order than that of nature. We must,\r\n  therefore, regard the supreme cause as a moral cause, and nature as so\r\n  ordered that realization of the moral end is in it possible. The final\r\n  conception of the Kantian philosophy is, therefore, that of ethical\r\n  teleology. As Kant expresses it in a remarkable passage of the\r\n  _Kritik_, \"The systematic unity of ends in this world of\r\n  intelligences, which, although as mere nature it is to be called only\r\n  the world of sense, can yet as a system of freedom be called an\r\n  intelligible, i.e. moral world (_regnum gratiae_), leads inevitably to\r\n  the teleological unity of all things which constitute this great whole\r\n  according to universal natural laws, just as the unity of the former\r\n  is according to universal and necessary moral laws, and unites the\r\n  practical with the speculative reason. The world must be represented\r\n  as having originated from an idea, if it is to harmonize with that use\r\n  of reason without which we should hold ourselves unworthy of\r\n  reason--viz. the moral use, which rests entirely on the idea of the\r\n  supreme good. Hence all natural research tends towards the form of a\r\n  system of ends, and in its highest development would be a\r\n  physico-theology. But this, since it arises from the moral order as a\r\n  unity grounded in the very essence of freedom and not accidentally\r\n  instituted by external commands, establishes the teleology of nature\r\n  on grounds which a priori must be inseparably connected with the inner\r\n  possibility of things. The teleology of nature is thus made to rest on\r\n  a transcendental theology, which takes the ideal of supreme\r\n  ontological perfection as a principle of systematic unity, a principle\r\n  which connects all things according to universal and necessary natural\r\n  laws, since they all have their origin in the absolute necessity of a\r\n  single primal being\" (p. 538).\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Editions and works of reference are exceedingly\r\n  numerous.

They are large-boned and coarse-featured, but contain\r\nnevertheless a distinct strain of Fula blood. Beriberi (or Berberi) is\r\nthe name given them by the Hausa (see BORNU).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAOLIN, a pure white clay, know also as china-clay, since it is an\r\nessential ingredient in the manufacture of china, or porcelain. The word\r\nkaolin, formerly written by some authors caulin, is said to be a\r\ncorruption of the Chinese _Kau-ling_, meaning \"High Ridge,\" the name of\r\na hill east of King-te-chen, whence the earliest samples of the clay\r\nsent to Europe were obtained by the Pere d'Entrecolles, a French Jesuit\r\nmissionary in China in the early part of the 18th century. His\r\nspecimens, examined in Paris by R. A. Reaumur, showed that true\r\nporcelain, the composition of which had not previously been known in\r\nEurope, contained two essential ingredients, which came to be\r\nknown--though it now appears incorrectly--as kaolin and petuntse,\r\ncorresponding respectively to our china-clay and china-stone. The kaolin\r\nconfers plasticity on the paste and secures retention of form for the\r\nware when exposed to the heat of the kiln, whilst the petuntse gives the\r\ntranslucency so characteristic of porcelain. Some of the earliest\r\ndiscoveries of kaolin in Europe were at Aue, near Schneeberg in Saxony,\r\nand at St Yrieix, near Limoges in France. In England it was discovered\r\nin Cornwall about the year 1750 by William Cookworthy, of Plymouth; and\r\nin 1768 he took out his patent for making porcelain from moorstone or\r\ngrowan (china-stone) and growan clay (kaolin), the latter imparting\r\n\"whiteness and infusibility\" to the china. These raw materials were\r\nfound first at Tregonning Hill, near Breage, and afterwards at St\r\nStephen's in Brannel, near St Austell; and their discovery led to the\r\nmanufacture of hard paste, or true porcelain, at Plymouth and\r\nsubsequently at Bristol.\r\n\r\nKaolin is a hydrous aluminium silicate, having the formula H4Al2Si2O9,\r\nor Al2Si2O7.2H2O, but in common clay this silicate is largely mixed with\r\nimpurities. Certain clays contain pearly white hexagonal scales, usually\r\nmicroscopic, referable to the monoclinic system, and having the chemical\r\ncomposition of kaolin. This crystalline substance was termed kaolinite\r\nby S. W. Johnson and J. M. Blake in 1867, and it is now regarded as the\r\nbasis of pure clay. The kaolinite of Amlwch in Anglesey has been studied\r\nby Allan Dick. The origin of kaolin may be traced to the alteration of\r\ncertain aluminous silicates like feldspar, scapolite, beryl and topaz;\r\nbut all large deposits of china-clay are due to the decomposition of\r\nfeldspar, generally in granite, but sometimes in gneiss, pitchstone, &c.\r\nThe turbidity of many feldspars is the result of partial\r\n\"kaolinization,\" or alteration to kaolin. The china-clay rocks of\r\nCornwall and Devon are granites in which the orthoclase has become\r\nkaolinized. These rocks are sometimes known as carclazite, a name\r\nproposed by J. H. Collins from a typical locality, the Carclaze mine,\r\nnear St Austell. It has often been supposed that the alteration of the\r\ngranite has been effected mainly by meteoric agencies, the carbonic acid\r\nhaving decomposed the alkaline silicate of the feldspar, whilst the\r\naluminous silicate assumes a hydrated condition and forms kaolin. In\r\nmany cases, however, it seems likely that the change has been effected\r\nby subterranean agencies, probably by heated vapours carrying fluorine\r\nand boron, since minerals containing these elements, like tourmaline,\r\noften occur in association with the china-clay. According to F. H.\r\nButler the kaolinization of the west of England granite may have been\r\neffected by a solution of carbonic acid at a high temperature, acting\r\nfrom below.\r\n\r\nThe china-stone, or petuntse, is a granitic rock which still retains\r\nmuch of the unaltered feldspar, on which its fusibility depends. In\r\norder to prepare kaolin for the market, the china-clay rock is broken\r\nup, and the clay washed out by means of water. The liquid containing\r\nthe clay in mechanical suspension is run into channels called \"drags\"\r\nwhere the coarser impurities subside, and whence it passes to another\r\nset of channels known as \"micas,\" where the finer materials settle down.\r\nThus purified, the clay-water is led into a series of pits or tanks, in\r\nwhich the finely divided clay is slowly deposited; and, after acquiring\r\nsufficient consistency, it is transferred to the drying-house, or \"dry,\"\r\nheated by flues, where the moisture is expelled, and the kaolin obtained\r\nas a soft white earthy substance. The clay has extensive application in\r\nthe arts, being used not only in ceramic manufacture but in\r\npaper-making, bleaching and various chemical industries.\r\n\r\nUnder the species \"kaolinite\" may be included several minerals which\r\nhave received distinctive names, such as the Saxon mineral called from\r\nits pearly lustre nacrite, a name originally given by A. Brongniart to a\r\nnacreous mica; pholerite found chiefly in cracks of ironstone and named\r\nby J. Guillemin from the Greek [Greek: pholis], a scale; and lithomarge,\r\nthe old German _Steinmark_, a compact clay-like body of white, yellow or\r\nred colour. Dr C. Hintze has pointed out that the word pholerite should\r\nproperly be written pholidite ([Greek: pholis, pholidos]). Closely\r\nrelated to kaolinite is the mineral called halloysite, a name given to\r\nit by P. Berthier after his uncle Omalius d'Halloy, the Belgian\r\ngeologist.     (F. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAPUNDA, a municipal town of Light county, South Australia, 48 m. by\r\nrail N.N.E. of Adelaide. Pop. (1901), 1805. It is the centre of a large\r\nwheat-growing district. The celebrated copper mines discovered in 1843\r\nwere closed in 1879. There are quarries near the town, in which is found\r\nfine marble of every colour from dark blue to white. This marble was\r\nlargely used in the Houses of Parliament at Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAPURTHALA, a native state of India, within the Punjab. Area, 652 sq.\r\nm.; pop. (1901), 314,341, showing an increase of 5% in the decade;\r\nestimated gross revenue, L178,000; tribute, L8700. The Kapurthala family\r\nis descended from Jassa Singh, a contemporary of Nadir Shah and Ahmad\r\nShah, who by his intelligence and bravery made himself the leading Sikh\r\nof his day. At one time it held possessions on both sides of the Sutlej,\r\nand also in the Bari Doab. The cis-Sutlej estates and scattered tracts\r\nin the Bari Doab were forfeited owing to the hostility of the chief in\r\nthe first Sikh war; but the latter were afterwards restored in\r\nrecognition of the loyalty of Raja Randhir Singh during the mutiny of\r\n1857, when he led a contingent to Oudh which did good service. He also\r\nreceived a grant of land in Oudh, 700 sq. m. in extent, yielding a gross\r\nrental of L89,000. In Oudh, however, he exercises no sovereign powers,\r\noccupying only the status of a large landholder, with the title of\r\nRaja-i-Rajagan. Raja Sir Jagatjit Singh, K.C.S.I., was born in 1872,\r\nsucceeded his father in 1877, and attained his majority in 1890. During\r\nthe Tirah expedition of 1897-98 the Kapurthala imperial service infantry\r\ntook a prominent part. The territory is crossed by the railway from\r\nJullundur to Amritsar. The state has a large export trade in wheat,\r\nsugar, tobacco and cotton. The hand-painted cloths and metal-work of\r\nPhagwara are well known. The town of Kapurthala is 11 miles from\r\nJullundur; pop. (1901), 18,519.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARACHI, or KURRACHEE, a seaport and district of British India, in the\r\nSind province of Bombay. The city is situated at the extreme western end\r\nof the Indus delta, 500 m. by sea from Bombay and 820 m. by rail from\r\nLahore, being the maritime terminus of the North-Western railway, and\r\nthe main gateway for the trade of the Punjab and part of central Asia.\r\nIt is also the capital of the province of Sind. Pop. (1881), 73,500;\r\n(1891), 105,199; (1901), 115,407. Before 1725 no town appears to have\r\nexisted here; but about that time some little trade began to centre upon\r\nthe convenient harbour, and the silting up of Shahbandar, the ancient\r\nport of Sind, shortly afterwards drove much of its former trade and\r\npopulation to the rising village. Under the Kalhora princes, the khan of\r\nKalat obtained a grant of the town, but in 1795 it was captured by the\r\nTalpur Mirs, who built the fort at Manora, at the entrance to the\r\nharbour. They also made considerable efforts to increase the trade of\r\nthe port and at the time of the British acquisition of the province the\r\ntown and suburbs contained a population of 14,000. This was in 1843,\r\nfrom which time the importance of the place practically dates.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Karachi has an extreme length and breadth of about 5 m.\r\nIt is protected by the promontory of Manora Head; and the entrance is\r\npartially closed by rocks and by the peninsula (formerly an island) of\r\nKiamari. On Manora Head, which is fortified, are the buildings of the\r\nport establishment, a cantonment, &c. Kiamari is the landing-place for\r\npassengers and goods, and has three piers and railway connexions. The\r\nharbour improvements were begun in 1854 with the building of the Napier\r\nMole or causeway connecting Kiamari with the mainland. The entrance has\r\na minimum depth of 25 ft.; and a large number of improvements and\r\nextensions have been carried out by the harbour board, which was created\r\nin 1880, and transformed in 1886 into the port trust.\r\n\r\nThe great extension of the canal colonies in the Punjab, entirely\r\ndevoted to the cultivation of wheat, has immensely increased the export\r\ntrade of Karachi. It now ranks as the third port of India, being\r\nsurpassed only by Calcutta and Bombay. The principal articles of export,\r\nbesides wheat, are oil-seeds, cotton, wool, hides and bones. The annual\r\nvalue of exports, including specie, amounts to about nine millions\r\nsterling. There are iron works and manufactures of cotton cloth, silk\r\nscarves and carpets. The fisheries and oyster beds are important.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal public buildings are government house, the Frere\r\nmunicipal hall, and the Napier barracks. The military cantonments,\r\nstretching north-east of the city, form the headquarters of a brigade in\r\nthe 4th division of the southern army. An excellent water supply is\r\nprovided by an underground aqueduct 18 m. in length. The chief\r\neducational institutions are the Dayaram Jethmal Arts College, with a\r\nlaw class; five high schools, of which two are for Europeans and one for\r\nMahommedans; a convent school for girls; and an engineering class. The\r\naverage rainfall for the year is about 5 in. The rainy months are July\r\nand August, but one or two heavy showers usually fall about Christmas.\r\nThe end of May, beginning of June, and first fortnight in October are\r\nhot. November, December, January, February and March are delightfully\r\ncool and dry; the remaining months are damp with a constant cool sea\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nThe DISTRICT OF KARACHI has an area of 11,970 sq. m. Pop. (1901),\r\n607,439, showing an increase of 6% in the decade. It consists of an\r\nimmense tract of land stretching from the mouth of the Indus to the\r\nBaluch boundary. It differs in general appearance from the rest of Sind,\r\nhaving a rugged, mountainous region along its western border. The\r\ncountry gradually slopes away to the south-east, till in the extreme\r\nsouth the Indus delta presents a broad expanse of low, flat and\r\nunpicturesque alluvium. Besides the Indus and its mouths, the only river\r\nin the district is the Hab, forming the boundary between Sind and\r\nBaluchistan. The Manchhar lake in Sehwan sub-division forms the only\r\nconsiderable sheet of water in Sind. The hot springs at Pir Mangho are 6\r\nm. N. of Karachi town. The principal crops are rice, millets, oil-seeds\r\nand wheat. In addition to Karachi, there are seaports at Sirgonda and\r\nKeti Bandar, which conduct a considerable coasting trade. Tatta was the\r\nold capital of Sind. Kotri is an important railway station on the Indus.\r\nThe main line of the North-Western railway runs through the district.\r\nFrom Kotri downwards the line has been doubled to Karachi, and at Kotri\r\na bridge has been constructed across the Indus opposite Hyderabad, to\r\nconnect with the Rajputana railway system.\r\n\r\n  See A. F. Baillie, _Kurrachee: Past, Present and Future_ (1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAGEORGE (in Servian, _Karadyordye_) (c. 1766-1817), the leader of the\r\nServians during their first revolution against the Turks (1804-13), and\r\nfounder of the Servian dynasty Karageorgevich. His Christian name was\r\nGeorge (Dyordye), but being not only of dark complexion but of gloomy,\r\ntaciturn and easily excitable temper, he was nicknamed by the Servians\r\n\"Tsrni Dyordye\" and by the Turks \"Karageorge,\" both meaning \"Black\r\nGeorge,\" the Turkish name becoming soon the generally adopted one. He\r\nwas born in 1766 (according to some in 1768), the son of an extremely\r\npoor Servian peasant, Petroniye Petrovich. When quite a young man, he\r\nentered the service of a renowned Turkish brigand, Fazli-Bey by name,\r\nand accompanied his master on his adventurous expeditions. When twenty\r\nhe married and started a small farm. But having killed a Turk, he left\r\nServia for Syrmia, in Croatia-Slavonia, where the monks of the monastery\r\nKrushedol engaged him as one of their forest guards. He remained in the\r\nservice of the monks nearly two years, then enlisted into an Austrian\r\nregiment, and as sergeant took part in the Austrian war against Turkey\r\n(1788-91). He deserted his regiment, returned to Servia, and settled in\r\nthe village of Topola, living sometimes as a peaceful farmer and\r\nsometimes again as the leader of a small band of \"hayduks\"--men who\r\nattacked, robbed and in most cases killed the travelling Turks in\r\nrevenge for the oppression of their country.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances in which the Servians rose against the janissaries of\r\nthe pashalik of Belgrade are related in the article on SERVIA. The\r\nleaders of the insurgents' bands and other men of influence met about\r\nthe middle of February 1804 at the village of Orashatz, and there\r\nelected Karageorge as the supreme leader (Vrhovni Vozd) of the nation.\r\nUnder his command the Servians speedily cleared their country not only\r\nof the janissaries disloyal to the Sultan, but of all other Turks, who\r\nwithdrew from the open country to the fortified places. Karageorge and\r\nhis armed Servians demanded from the Sultan the privileges of\r\nself-government. The Porte, confronted by the chances of a war with\r\nRussia, decided in the autumn of 1806 to grant to the Servians a fairly\r\nlarge measure of autonomy. Unfortunately Karageorge was comparatively\r\npoor in political gifts and diplomatic tact. While the _hattisherif_\r\ngranting the rights demanded by the Servians was on the way to Servia,\r\nKarageorge attacked the Turks in Belgrade and Shabats, captured the\r\ntowns first and then also the citadels, and allowed the Turkish\r\npopulation of Belgrade to be massacred. At the same time the Russian\r\nheadquarters in Bucharest informed Karageorge that Russia was at war\r\nwith Turkey and that the Tsar counted on the co-operation of the\r\nServians. Karageorge and his Servians then definitely rejected all the\r\nconcessions which the Porte had granted them, and joined Russia, hoping\r\nthereby to secure the complete independence of Servia. The co-operation\r\nof the Servians with the Russians was of no great importance, and\r\nprobably disappointing to both parties. But as the principal theatre of\r\nwar was far away from Servia on the lower Danube, Karageorge was able to\r\ngive more attention to the internal organization of Servia. The national\r\nassembly proclaimed Karageorge the hereditary chief and _gospodar_ of\r\nthe Servians (Dec. 26, 1808), he on his part promising under oath to\r\ngovern the country \"through and by the national council\" (senate).\r\n\r\nKarageorge's hasty and uncompromising temper and imperious habits, as\r\nwell as his want of political tact, soon made him many enemies amongst\r\nthe more prominent Servians (voyvodes and senators). His difficulties\r\nwere considerably increased by the intrigues of the Russian political\r\nagent to Servia, Rodophinikin. A crisis came during the summer months of\r\nthe year 1813. The treaty of peace, concluded by the Russians somewhat\r\nhurriedly in Bucharest in 1812, did not secure efficiently the safety of\r\nthe Servians. The Turks demanded from Karageorge, as a preliminary\r\ncondition for peace, that the Servians should lay down their arms, and\r\nKarageorge refused to comply. Thereupon the entire Turkish army which\r\nfought against the Russians on the Danube, being disengaged, invaded\r\nServia. After a few inefficient attempts to stem the invasion,\r\nKarageorge gave up the struggle, and with most of the voyvodes and\r\nchiefs of the nation left the country, and crossed to Hungary as a\r\nrefugee (Sept. 20, 1813). From Hungary he went to Russia and settled in\r\nKhotin (Bessarabia), enjoying a pension from the Tsar's government. But\r\nin the summer of 1817 he suddenly and secretly left Russia and\r\nreappeared quite alone in Servia in the neighbourhood of Semendria\r\n(Smederevo) on the Danube. The motives and the object of his return are\r\nnot clear. Some believe that he was sent by the Hetaerists to raise up\r\nServia to a new war with Turkey and thereby facilitate the rising of the\r\nGreek people. It is generally assumed, however, that, having heard that\r\nServia, under the guidance of Milosh Obrenovich, had obtained a certain\r\nmeasure of self-government, he desired to put himself again at the head\r\nof the nation. This impression seems to have been that of Milosh\r\nhimself, who at once reported to the Pasha of Belgrade the arrival of\r\nKarageorge. The pasha demanded that Karageorge, alive or dead, should be\r\ndelivered to him immediately, and made Milosh personally responsible for\r\nthe execution of that order. Karageorge's removal could not\r\nunfortunately be separated from the personal interest of Milosh; already\r\nacknowledged as chief of the nation, Milosh did not like to be displaced\r\nby his old chief, who in a critical moment had left the country.\r\nKarageorge was killed (July 27, O.S., 1817) while he was asleep, and his\r\nhead was sent to the pasha for transmission to Constantinople. It is\r\nimpossible to exonerate Milosh Obrenovich from responsibility for the\r\nmurder, which became the starting-point for a series of tragedies in the\r\nmodern history of Servia.\r\n\r\nKarageorge was one of the most remarkable Servians of the 19th century.\r\nNo other man could have led the bands of undisciplined and badly-armed\r\nServian peasants to such decisive victories against the Turks. Although\r\nhe never assumed the title of prince, he practically was the first chief\r\nand master (_gospodar_) of the people of Servia. He succeeded, however,\r\nnot because he was liked but because he was feared. His gloomy silence,\r\nhis easily aroused anger, his habit of punishing without hesitation the\r\nslightest transgressions by death, spread terror among the people. He is\r\nbelieved to have killed his own father in a fit of anger when the old\r\nman refused to follow him in his flight to Hungary at the beginning of\r\nhis career. In another fit of rage at the report that his brother\r\nMarinko had assaulted a girl, he ordered his men to seize his brother\r\nand to hang him there and then in his presence, and he forbade his\r\nmother to go into mourning for him. Even by his admirers he is admitted\r\nto have killed by his own hand no fewer than 125 men who provoked his\r\nanger. But in battles he is acknowledged to have been always admirable,\r\ndisplaying marvellous energy and valour, and giving proofs of a real\r\nmilitary genius. The Servians consider him one of their greatest men. In\r\ngrateful remembrance of his services to the national cause they elected\r\nhis younger son, Alexander, in 1842, to be the reigning prince of\r\nServia, and again in 1903 they chose his grandson, Peter Karageorgevich\r\n(son of Alexander) to be the king of Servia.\r\n\r\n  See SERVIA; also Ranke, _Die serbische Revolution_; Stoyan Novakovich,\r\n  _Vaskzhs srpske drzhave_ (Belgrade, 1904); M.

(2) ICHJE,\r\nor ISCHA KARA-HISSAR (anc. _Docimium_), a small village about 14 m. N.E.\r\nof No. 1. Docimium was a Macedonian colony established on an older site.\r\nIt was a self-governing municipality, striking its own coins, and stood\r\non the Apamea-Synnada-Pessinus road, by which the celebrated marble\r\ncalled Synnadic, Docimian and Phrygian was conveyed to the coast. The\r\nquarries are 2(1/2) m. from the village, and the marble was carried\r\nthence direct to Synnada (Chifut Kassaba). Some of the marble has the\r\nrich purple veins in which poets saw the blood of Atys.\r\n\r\n  See W. M. Ramsay, _Hist. Geog. of Asia Minor_ (London, 1890); Murray,\r\n  _Hbk. to Asia Minor_ (1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARA-HISSAR SHARKI [i.e. \"eastern Kara-Hissar\"], also called Shabin\r\nKara-Hissar from the alum mines in its vicinity, the chief town of a\r\nsanjak of the same name in the Sivas vilayet of Asia Minor. Pop. about\r\n12,000, two-thirds Mussulman. It is the Roman _Colonia_, which gradually\r\nsuperseded Pompey's foundation, _Nicopolis_, whose ruins lie at Purkh,\r\nabout 12 m. W. (hence Kara-Hissar is called Nikopoli by the Armenians).\r\nIn later Byzantine times it was an important frontier station, and did\r\nnot pass into Ottoman hands till twelve years after the capture of\r\nConstantinople. The town, altitude 4860 ft., is built round the foot of\r\na lofty rock, upon which stand the ruins of the Byzantine castle,\r\n_Maurocastron_, the Kara Hissar Daula of early Moslem chroniclers. It is\r\nconnected with its port, Kerasund, and with Sivas, Erzingan and Erzerum,\r\nby carriage roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAISKAKIS, GEORGES (1782-1827), leader in the War of Greek\r\nIndependence, was born at Agrapha in 1782. During the earlier stages of\r\nthe war he served in the Morea, and had a somewhat discreditable share\r\nin the intrigues which divided the Greek leaders. But he showed a sense\r\nof the necessity for providing the country with a government, and was a\r\nsteady supporter of Capo d'Istria. His most honourable services were\r\nperformed in the middle and later stages of the war. He helped to raise\r\nthe first siege of Missolonghi in 1823, and did his best to save the\r\ntown in the second siege in 1826. In that year he commanded the patriot\r\nforces in Rumelia, and though he failed to co-operate effectually with\r\nother chiefs, or with the foreign sympathizers fighting for the Greeks,\r\nhe gained some successes against the Turks which were very welcome amid\r\nthe disasters of the time. He took a share in the unsuccessful attempts\r\nto raise the siege of Athens in 1827, and made an effort to prevent the\r\ndisastrous massacre of the Turkish garrison of fort S Spiridion. He was\r\nshot in action on the 4th of May 1827. Finlay speaks of him as a capable\r\npartisan leader who had great influence over his men, and describes him\r\nas of \"middle size, thin, dark-complexioned, with a bright expressive\r\nanimal eye which indicated gipsy blood.\"\r\n\r\n  See G. Finlay, _History of the Greek Revolution_ (London, 1861).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAJICH, VUK STEFANOVICH (1787-1864), the father of modern Servian\r\nliterature, was born on the 6th of November 1787 in the Servian village\r\nof Trshich, on the border between Bosnia and Servia. Having learnt to\r\nread and write in the old monastery Tronosha (near his native village),\r\nhe was engaged as writer and reader of letters to the commander of the\r\ninsurgents of his district at the beginning of the first Servian rising\r\nagainst the Turks in 1804. Mostly in the position of a scribe to\r\ndifferent voyvodes, sometimes as school-teacher, he served his country\r\nduring the first revolution (1804-1813), at the collapse of which he\r\nleft Servia, but instead of following Karageorge and other voyvodes to\r\nRussia he went to Vienna. There he was introduced to the great Slavonic\r\nscholar Yerney Kopitar, who, having heard him recite some Servian\r\nnational ballads, encouraged him to collect the poems and popular songs,\r\nwrite a grammar of the Servian language, and, if possible, a dictionary.\r\nThis programme of literary work was adhered to by Karajich, who all his\r\nlife acknowledged gratefully what he owed to his learned teacher.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the 18th and in the beginning of the 19th century\r\nall Servian literary efforts were written in a language which was not\r\nthe Servian vernacular, but an artificial language, of which the\r\nfoundation was the Old Slavonic in use in the churches, but somewhat\r\nRussianized, and mixed with Servian words forced into Russian forms.\r\nThat language, called by its writers \"the Slavonic-Servian,\" was neither\r\nSlavonic nor Servian. It was written in Old Cyrillic letters, many of\r\nwhich had no meaning in the Servian language, while there were several\r\nsounds in that language which had no corresponding signs or letters in\r\nthe Old Slavonic alphabet. The Servian philosopher Dositey Obradovich\r\n(who at the end of the 18th century spent some time in London teaching\r\nGreek) was the first Servian author to proclaim the principle that the\r\nbooks for the Servian people ought to be written in the language of the\r\npeople. But the great majority of his contemporaries were of opinion\r\nthat the language of Servian literature ought to be evolved out of the\r\ndead Old Slavonic of the church books. The church naturally decidedly\r\nsupported this view. Karajich was the great reformer who changed all\r\nthis. Encouraged by Kopitar, he published in 1814 (2nd ed., 1815) in\r\nVienna his first book, _Mala Prostonarodna Slaveno-Serbska Pyesmaritsa_\r\n(\"A small collection of Slavonic-Servian songs of the common people\"),\r\ncontaining a hundred lyric songs, sung by the peasant women of Servia,\r\nand six poems about heroes, or as the Servians call them _Yunachke\r\npesme_, which are generally recited by the blind bards or by peasants.\r\nFrom that time Karajich's literary activity moved on two parallel lines:\r\nto give scientific justification and foundation to the adoption of the\r\nvernacular Servian as the literary language; and, by collecting and\r\npublishing national songs, folk-lore, proverbs, &c., to show the\r\nrichness of the Servian people's poetical and intellectual gifts, and\r\nthe wealth and beauty of the Servian language. By his reform of the\r\nServian alphabet and orthography, his Servian grammar and his Servian\r\ndictionary, he established the fact that the Servian language contains\r\nthirty distinct sounds, for six of which the Old Slavonic alphabet had\r\nno special letters. He introduced new letters for those special sounds,\r\nat the same time throwing out of the Old Slavonic alphabet eighteen\r\nletters for which the Servian language had no use. This reform was\r\nstrenuously opposed by the church and many conservative authors, who\r\nwent so far as to induce the Servian government to prohibit the printing\r\nof books in new letters, a prohibition removed in 1859. Karajich's\r\nalphabet facilitated his reform of orthography, his principle being:\r\n_write as you speak, and read as it is written_! Hardly any other\r\nlanguage in the civilized world has such a simple, logical, scientific\r\nspelling system and orthography as the Servian has in Karajich's system.\r\nHis first grammatical essay was published in Vienna in 1814, _Pismenitsa\r\nSerbskoga yezika po govoru prostoga naroda_ (\"The grammar of the Servian\r\nlanguage as spoken by the common people\"). An improved edition appeared\r\nin Vienna in 1818, together with his great work _Srpski Ryechnik_\r\n(Lexicon Serbico-Germanico-Latinum). This dictionary--containing 26,270\r\nwords--was full of important contributions to folk-lore, as Karajich\r\nnever missed an opportunity to add to the meaning of the word the\r\ndescription of the national customs or popular beliefs connected with\r\nit. A new edition of his dictionary, containing 46,270 words, was\r\npublished at Vienna in 1852. Meanwhile he gave himself earnestly to the\r\nwork of collecting the \"creations of the mind of the Servian common\r\npeople.\" He travelled through Servian countries (Servia, Bosnia,\r\nHerzegovina, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Syrmia, Croatia), and the result was\r\nshown in a largely augmented edition of his _Srpske Narodne Pyesme_, of\r\nwhich the first three volumes appeared at Leipzig in 1823 and 1824, the\r\nfourth volume appearing at Vienna in 1833. _Popular Stories and Enigmas_\r\nwas published in 1821, and _Servian National Proverbs_ in 1836. From\r\n1826 to 1834 he was the editor of an annual, called _Danitsa_ (The\r\nMorning Star), which he filled with important contributions concerning\r\nthe ethnography and modern history of the Servian people. In 1828 he\r\npublished a historical monograph, _Milosh Obrenovich, Prince of Servia_;\r\nin 1837, in German, _Montenegro and Montenegrins_; in 1867, _The Servian\r\nGoverning Council of State_. He supplied Leopold Ranke with the\r\nmaterials for his _History of the Servian Revolution_. He also\r\ntranslated the New Testament into Servian, for the British and Foreign\r\nBible Society (Vienna, 1847). Karajich died in Vienna on the 6th of\r\nFebruary 1864; and his remains were transferred to Belgrade in 1897 with\r\ngreat solemnity and at the expense of the government of Servia.\r\n     (C. Mi.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARA-KALPAKS (\"Black Caps\"), a Mongolo-Tatar people, originally dominant\r\nalong the east coast of the Aral Sea, where they still number some\r\nthousands. They thus form geographically the transition between the\r\nnorthern Kirghiz and the southern Turkomans. Once a powerful nation,\r\nthey are scattered for the most part in Astrakhan, Perm, Orenburg, in\r\nthe Caucasian province of Kuban, and in Tobolsk, Siberia, numbering in\r\nall about 50,000. These emigrants have crossed much with the alien\r\npopulations among whom they have settled; but the pure type on the Aral\r\nSea are a tall powerful people, with broad flat faces, large eyes, short\r\nnoses and heavy chins. Their women are the most beautiful in Turkestan.\r\nThe name of \"Black Caps\" is given them in allusion to their high\r\nsheepskin hats. They are a peaceful agricultural folk, who have suffered\r\nmuch from their fierce nomad neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAKORUM (Turkish, \"black stone debris\"), the name of two cities in\r\nMongolia. One of these, according to G. Potanin, was the capital of the\r\nUighur kingdom in the 8th century, and the other was in the 13th century\r\na capital of the steppe monarchy of Mongolia. The same name seems also\r\nto have been applied to the Khangai range at the headwaters of the\r\nOrkhon. (1) The Uighur KARAKORUM, also named Mubalik (\"bad town\"), was\r\nsituated on the left bank of the Orkhon, in the Talal-khain-dala steppe,\r\nto the south-east of Ughei-nor. It was deserted after the fall of the\r\nUighur kingdom, and in the 10th century Abaki, the founder of the Khitan\r\nkingdom, planted on its ruins a stone bearing a description of his\r\nvictories. (2) The Mongolian KARAKORUM was founded at the birth of the\r\nMongolian monarchy established by Jenghiz Khan. A palace for the khan\r\nwas built in it by Chinese architects in 1234, and its walls were\r\nerected in 1235. Plano Carpini visited it in 1246, Rubruquis in 1253,\r\nand Marco Polo in 1275. Later, the fourth Mongolian king, Kublai, left\r\nKarakorum, in order to reside at Kai-pin-fu, near Peking. When the khan\r\nArik-bog declared himself and Karakorum independent of Kublai-Khan, the\r\nlatter besieged Karakorum, took it by famine, and probably laid it waste\r\nso thoroughly that the town was afterwards forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe exact sites of the two Mongolian capitals were only established in\r\n1889-1891. Sir H. Yule (_The Book of Marco Polo_, 1871) was the first to\r\ndistinguish two cities of this name. The Russian traveller Paderin in\r\n1871 visited the Uighur capital (see TURKS), named now by the Mongols\r\nKara Balghasun (\"black city\") or Khara-kherem (\"black wall\"), of which\r\nonly the wall and a tower are in existence, while the streets and ruins\r\noutside the wall are seen at a distance of 1(3/4) m. Paderin's belief\r\nthat this was the old Mongol capital has been shown to be incorrect. As\r\nto the Mongolian Karakorum, it is identified by several authorities with\r\na site on which towards the close of the 16th century the Buddhist\r\nmonastery of Erdeni Tsu was built. This monastery lies about 25 m. south\r\nby east of the Uighur capital. North and north-east of the monastery are\r\nruins of ancient buildings. Professor D. Pozdneev, who visited Erdeni\r\nTsu for a second time in 1892, stated that the earthen wall surrounding\r\nthe monastery might well be part of the wall of the old city. The proper\r\nposition of the two Karakorums was determined by the expedition of N.\r\nYadrintsev in 1889, and the two expeditions of the Helsingfors\r\nUgro-Finnish society (1890) and the Russian academy of science, under Dr\r\nW. Radlov (1891), which were sent out to study Yadrintsev's discovery.\r\n\r\n  See _Works (Trudy) of the Orkhon Expedition_ (St Petersburg, 1892);\r\n  Yule's _Marco Polo_, edition revised by Henri Cordier (of Paris), vol.\r\n  i. ch. xlvi. (London, 1903). Cordier confines the use of Karakorum to\r\n  the Mongol capital; Pozdneev, _Mongolia and the Mongols_, vol. i. (St\r\n  Petersburg, 1896); C. W. Campbell, \"Journeys in Mongolia,\" _Geog.\r\n  Journ._ vol. xx. (1903), with map. Campbell's report was printed as a\r\n  parliamentary paper (_China No. 1, 1904_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARA-KUL, the name of two lakes (\"Great\" and \"Little \") of Russian\r\nTurkestan, in the province of Ferghana, and on the Pamir plateau. Great\r\nKara-kul, 12 m. long and 10 m. wide (formerly much larger), is under 39\r\ndeg. N., to the south of the Trans-Alai range, and lies at an altitude\r\nof 13,200 ft.; it is surrounded by high mountains, and is reached from\r\nthe north over the Kyzyl-art pass (14,015 ft.). A peninsula projecting\r\nfrom the south shore and an island off the north shore divide it into\r\ntwo basins, a smaller eastern one which is shallow, 42 to 63 ft., and a\r\nlarger western one, which has depths of 726 to 756 ft. It has no\r\ndrainage outlet. Little Kara-kul lies in the north-east Pamir, or\r\nSarikol, north-west of the Mustagh-ata peak (25,850 ft.), at an altitude\r\nof 12,700 ft. It varies in depth from 79 ft. in the south to 50 to 70\r\nft. in the middle, and 1000 ft. or more in the north. It is a moraine\r\nlake; and a stream of the same name flows through it, but is named Ghez\r\nin its farther course towards Kashgar in East Turkestan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARA-KUM (\"Black Sands\"), a flat desert in Russian Central Asia. It\r\nextends to nearly 110,000 sq. m., and is bounded on the N.W. by the\r\nUst-urt plateau, between the Sea of Aral and the Caspian Sea, on the\r\nN.E. by the Amu-darya, on the S. by the Turkoman oases, and on the W. it\r\nnearly reaches the Caspian Sea. Only part of this surface is covered\r\nwith sand. There are broad expanses (_takyrs_) of clay soil upon which\r\nwater accumulates in the spring; in the summer these are muddy, but\r\nlater quite dry, and merely a few Solanaceae and bushes grow on them.\r\nThere is also _shor_, similar to the above but encrusted with salt and\r\ngypsum, and relieved only by Solanaceae along their borders. The\r\nremainder is occupied with sand, which, according to V. Mainov, assumes\r\nfive different forms. (1) _Barkhans_, chiefly in the east, which are\r\nmounds of loose sand, 15 to 35 ft. high, hoof-shaped, having their\r\ngently sloping convex sides turned towards the prevailing winds, and a\r\nconcave side, 30 deg. to 40 deg. steep, on the opposite slope. They are\r\ndisposed in groups or chains, and the winds drive them at an average\r\nrate of 20 ft. annually towards the south and south-east. Some grass\r\n(_Stipa pennata_) and bushes of _saksaul_ (_Haloxylon ammodendron_) and\r\nother steppe bushes (e.g. _Calligonium_, _Halimodendron_ and\r\n_Atraphaxis_) grow on them. (2) Mounds of sand, of about the same size,\r\nbut irregular in shape and of a slightly firmer consistence, mostly\r\nbearing the same bushes, and also _Artemisia_ and _Tamarix_; they are\r\nchiefly met with in the east and south. (3) A sandy desert, slightly\r\nundulating, and covered in spring with grass and flowers (e.g. tulips,\r\n_Rheum_, various Umbelliferae), which are soon burned by the sun; they\r\ncover very large spaces in the south-east. (4) Sands disposed in waves\r\nfrom 50 to 70 ft., and occasionally up to 100 ft. high, at a distance of\r\nfrom 200 to 400 ft. from each other; they cover the central portion, and\r\ntheir vegetation is practically the same as in the preceding division.\r\n(5) Dunes on the shores of the Caspian, composed of moving sands, 35 to\r\n80 ft. high and devoid of vegetation.\r\n\r\nA typical feature of the Kara-kum is the number of \"old river beds,\"\r\nwhich may have been either channels of tributaries of the Amu and other\r\nrivers or depressions which contained elongated salt lakes. Water is\r\nonly found in wells, 10 to 20 m. apart--sometimes as much as 100\r\nm.--which are dug in the takyrs and give saline water, occasionally\r\nunfit to drink, and in pools of rain-water retained in the lower parts\r\nof the takyrs. The population of the Kara-kum, consisting of nomad\r\nKirghiz and Turkomans, is very small. The region in the north of the\r\nprovince of Syr-darya, between Lake Aral and Lake Chalkarteniz, is also\r\ncalled Kara-kum.     (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAMAN (anc. _Laranda_, a name still used by the Christian\r\ninhabitants), a town in the Konia vilayet of Asia Minor, situated in the\r\nplain north of Mount Taurus. Pop. 8000. It has few industries and little\r\ntrade, but the medieval walls, well preserved castle and mosques are\r\ninteresting, and the old Seljuk _medresse_, or college, is a beautiful\r\nbuilding. Karaman is connected with Konia by railway, having a station\r\non the first section of the Bagdad railway. Little is known of its\r\nancient history except that it was destroyed by Perdiccas about 322\r\nB.C., and afterwards became a seat of Isaurian pirates. It was occupied\r\nby Frederick Barbarossa in 1190; in 1466 it was captured by Mahommed\r\nII., and in 1486 by Bayezid II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAMANIA, formerly an independent inland province in the south of Asia\r\nMinor, named after Karaman, the son of an Armenian convert to Islam, who\r\nmarried a daughter of Ala ed-Din Kaikobad, the Seljuk sultan of Rum, and\r\nwas granted Laranda in fief, and made governor of Selefke, 1223-1245.\r\nThe name Karaman is, however, Turkoman and that of a powerful tribe,\r\nsettled apparently near Laranda. The Armenian convert must have been\r\nadopted into this. On the collapse of the Seljuk empire, Karaman's\r\ngrandson, Mahmud, 1279-1319, founded a state, which included Pamphylia,\r\nLycaonia and large parts of Cilicia, Cappadocia and Phrygia. Its\r\ncapital, Laranda, superseded Konia. This state was frequently at war\r\nwith the kings of Lesser Armenia, the Lusignan princes of Cyprus and the\r\nknights of Rhodes. It was also engaged in a long struggle for supremacy\r\nwith the Osmanli Turks, which only ended in 1472, when it was definitely\r\nannexed by Mahommed II. The Osmanlis divided Karamania into Kharij\r\nnorth, and Ichili south, of the Taurus, and restored Konia to its\r\nmetropolitan position. The name Karamania is now often given by\r\ngeographers to Ichili only; but so far as it has had any exact\r\nsignificance in modern times, it has stood for the whole province of\r\nKonia. Before the present provincial division was made (1864), Karamania\r\nwas the eyalet of which Konia was the capital, and it did not extend to\r\nthe sea, the whole littoral from Adalia eastward being under the pasha\r\nof Adana. Nevertheless, in Levantine popular usage at the present day,\r\n\"Karamania\" signifies the coast from Adalia to Messina.     (D. G. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAMNASA, a river of northern India, tributary to the Ganges on its\r\nright bank, forming the boundary between Bengal and the United\r\nProvinces. The name means \"destroyer of religious merit,\" which is\r\nexplained by more than one legend. To this day all high-caste Hindus\r\nhave to be carried over without being defiled by the touch of its\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARA MUSTAFA (d. 1683), Turkish vizier, surnamed \"Merzifunli,\" was a son\r\nof Uruj Bey, a notable Sipahi of Merzifun (Marsovan), and brother-in-law\r\nto Ahmed Kuprili, whom he succeeded as grand vizier in 1676, after\r\nhaving for some years held the office of Kaimmakam or _locum tenens_.\r\nHis greed and ostentation were equalled by his incapacity, and he\r\nbehaved with characteristic insolence to the foreign ambassadors, from\r\nwhom he extorted large bribes. After conducting a campaign in Poland\r\nwhich terminated unfortunately, he gave a ready response to the appeal\r\nfor aid made by the Hungarians under Imre Thokoly (q.v.) when they rose\r\nagainst Austria, his hope being to form out of the Habsburg dominions a\r\nMussulman empire of the West, of which he should be the sultan. The plan\r\nwas foiled in part by his own lack of military skill, but chiefly\r\nthrough the heroic resistance of Vienna and its timely relief by John\r\nSobieski, king of Poland. Kara Mustafa paid for his defeat with his\r\nlife; he was beheaded at Belgrade in 1683 and his head was brought to\r\nthe sultan on a silver dish.\r\n\r\nAnother KARA MUSTAFA PASHA (d. 1643), who figures in Turkish history,\r\nwas by birth a Hungarian, who was enrolled in the Janissaries, rose to\r\nbe Kapudan Pasha under Murad IV., and after the capture of Bagdad was\r\nmade grand vizier. He was severe, but just and impartial, and strove to\r\neffect necessary reforms by reducing the numbers of the Janissaries,\r\nimproving the coinage, and checking the state expenditure. But the\r\ndiscontent of the Janissaries led to his dismissal and death in 1643.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAMZIN, NIKOLAI MIKHAILOVICH (1765-1826), Russian historian, critic,\r\nnovelist and poet, was born at the village of Mikhailovka, in the\r\ngovernment of Orenburg, and not at Simbirsk as many of his English and\r\nGerman biographers incorrectly state, on the 1st of December (old style)\r\n1765. His father was an officer in the Russian army, of Tatar\r\nextraction. He was sent to Moscow to study under Professor Schaden,\r\nwhence he afterwards removed to St Petersburg, where he made the\r\nacquaintance of Dmitriev, a Russian poet of some merit, and occupied\r\nhimself with translating essays by foreign writers into his native\r\nlanguage. After residing some time at St Petersburg, he went to\r\nSimbirsk, where he lived in retirement till induced to revisit Moscow.\r\nThere, finding himself in the midst of the society of learned men, he\r\nagain betook himself to literary work. In 1789 he resolved to travel,\r\nand visited Germany, France, Switzerland and England. On his return he\r\npublished his _Letters of a Russian Traveller_, which met with great\r\nsuccess. These letters were first printed in the _Moscow Journal_, which\r\nhe edited, but were afterwards collected and issued in six volumes\r\n(1797-1801). In the same periodical Karamzin also published translations\r\nof some of the tales of Marmontel, and some original stories, among\r\nwhich may be mentioned _Poor Liza_ and _Natalia the Boyar's Daughter_.\r\nIn 1794 and 1795 Karamzin abandoned his literary journal, and published\r\na miscellany in two volumes, entitled _Aglaia_, in which appeared, among\r\nother things, \"The Island of Bornholm\" and \"Ilia Mourometz,\" a story\r\nbased upon the adventures of the well-known hero of many a Russian\r\nlegend. In 1797-1799 he issued another miscellany or poetical almanac,\r\n_The Aonides_, in conjunction with Derzhavin and Dmitriev. In 1798 he\r\ncompiled _The Pantheon_, a collection of pieces from the works of the\r\nmost celebrated authors ancient and modern, translated into Russian.\r\nMany of his lighter productions were subsequently printed by him in a\r\nvolume entitled _My Trifles_. In 1802 and 1803 Karamzin edited the\r\njournal the _European Messenger_. It was not until after the publication\r\nof this work that he realized where his strength lay, and commenced his\r\n_History of the Russian Empire_. In order to accomplish the task, he\r\nsecluded himself for two years; and, on the cause of his retirement\r\nbecoming known to the emperor Alexander, Karamzin was invited to Tver,\r\nwhere he read to the emperor the first eight volumes of his history. In\r\n1816 he removed to St Petersburg, where he spent the happiest days of\r\nhis life, enjoying the favour of Alexander, and submitting to him the\r\nsheets of his great work, which the emperor read over with him in the\r\ngardens of the palace of Tzarskoe Selo. He did not, however, live to\r\ncarry his work further than the eleventh volume, terminating it at the\r\naccession of Michael Romanov in 1613. He died on the 22nd of May (old\r\nstyle) 1826, in the Taurida palace. A monument was erected to his memory\r\nat Simbirsk in 1845.\r\n\r\n  As an historian Karamzin has deservedly a very high reputation. Till\r\n  the appearance of his work little had been done in this direction in\r\n  Russia. The preceding attempt of Tatistchev was merely a rough sketch,\r\n  inelegant in style, and without the true spirit of criticism. Karamzin\r\n  was most industrious in accumulating materials, and the notes to his\r\n  volumes are mines of curious information. The style of his history is\r\n  elegant and flowing, modelled rather upon the easy sentences of the\r\n  French prose writers than the long periodical paragraphs of the old\r\n  Slavonic school. Perhaps Karamzin may justly be censured for the false\r\n  gloss and romantic air thrown over the early Russian annals,\r\n  concealing the coarseness and cruelty of the native manners; in this\r\n  respect he reminds us of Sir Walter Scott, whose writings were at this\r\n  time creating a great sensation throughout Europe, and probably had\r\n  their influence upon him. Karamzin appears openly as the panegyrist of\r\n  the autocracy; indeed, his work has been styled the \"Epic of\r\n  Despotism.\" He does not hesitate to avow his admiration of Ivan the\r\n  Terrible, and considers him and his grandfather Ivan III. as the\r\n  builders up of Russian greatness, a glory which in his earlier\r\n  writings, perhaps at that time more under the influence of Western\r\n  ideas, he had assigned to Peter the Great. In the battle-pieces (e.g.\r\n  the description of the field of Koulikovo, the taking of Kazan, &c.)\r\n  we find considerable powers of description; and the characters of many\r\n  of the chief personages in the Russian annals are drawn in firm and\r\n  bold lines. As a critic Karamzin was of great service to his country;\r\n  in fact he may be regarded as the founder of the review and essay (in\r\n  the Western style) among the Russians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARA SEA, a portion of the Arctic Ocean demarcated, and except on the\r\nnorth-west completely enclosed, by Novaya Zemlya, Vaygach Island and the\r\nSiberian coast. It is approached from the west by three\r\nstraits--Matochkin, between the two islands of Novaya Zemlya, and Kara\r\nand Yugor to the north and south of Vaygach Island respectively. On the\r\nsouth-east Kara Bay penetrates deeply into the mainland, and to the west\r\nof this the short Kara river enters the sea. The sea is all shallow, the\r\ndeepest parts lying off Vaygach Island and the northern part of Novaya\r\nZemlya. It had long the reputation of being almost constantly ice-bound,\r\nbut after the Norwegian captain Johannesen had demonstrated its\r\naccessibility in 1869, and Nordenskiold had crossed it to the mouth of\r\nthe Yenisei in 1875, it was considered by many to offer a possible trade\r\nroute between European Russia and the north of Siberia. But the open\r\nseason is in any case very short, and the western straits are sometimes\r\nice-bound during the entire year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARASU-BAZAR, a town of Russia, in the Crimea and government of Taurida,\r\nin 45 deg. 3' N. and 34 deg. 26' E., 25 m. E.N.E. of Simferopol. Pop.\r\n(1897), 12,961, consisting of Tatars, Armenians, Greeks, Qaraite Jews,\r\nand about 200 so-called Krymchaki, i.e. Jews who have adopted the Tatar\r\nlanguage and dress, and who live chiefly by making morocco leather\r\ngoods, knives, embroidery and so forth. The site is low, but the town is\r\nsurrounded by hills, which afford protection from the north wind. The\r\ndirty streets full of petty traders, the gloomy bazaar with its\r\nmultitude of tiny shops, the market squares, the blind alleys, the\r\nlittle gates in the dead courtyard walls, all give the place the stamp\r\nof a Tatar or Turkish town. Placed on the high road between Simferopol\r\nand Kerch, and in the midst of a country rich in corn land, vineyards\r\nand gardens, Karasu-Bazar used to be a chief seat of commercial activity\r\nin the Crimea; but it is gradually declining in importance, though still\r\na considerable centre for the export of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe caves of Akkaya close by give evidence of early occupation of the\r\nspot. When in 1736 Khan Feta Ghirai was driven by the Russians from\r\nBakhchi-sarai he settled at Karasu-Bazar, but next year the town was\r\ncaptured, plundered and burned by the Russians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARATEGHIN, a country of Central Asia, subject to Bokhara, and\r\nconsisting of a highland district bounded on the N. by Samarkand and\r\nFerghana (Khokand), on the E. by Ferghana, on the S. by Darvaz, and on\r\nthe W. by Hissar and other Bokharian provinces. The plateau is traversed\r\nby the Surkhab or Vakhsh, a right-hand tributary of the Amu-darya\r\n(Oxus). On the N. border run the Hissar and Zarafshan mountains, and on\r\nthe S. border the Peter I. (Periokhtan) range (24,900 ft.). The area is\r\n8000 sq. m. and the population about 60,000--five-sixths Tajiks, the\r\nrest Kara-kirghiz. With the neighbouring lands Karateghin has no\r\ncommunication except during summer, that is, from May to September. The\r\nwinter climate is extremely severe; snow begins to fall in October and\r\nit is May before it disappears. During the warmer months, however, the\r\nmountain sides are richly clothed with the foliage of maple, mountain\r\nash, apple, pear and walnut trees; the orchards furnish, not only apples\r\nand pears, but peaches, cherries, mulberries and apricots; and the\r\nfarmers grow sufficient corn to export. Both cattle and horses are of a\r\nsmall and hardy breed. Rough woollen cloth and mohair are woven by the\r\nnatives, who also make excellent firearms and other weapons. Gold is\r\nfound in various places and there are salt-pits in the mountains. The\r\nchief town, Harm or Garm, is a place of some 2000 inhabitants, situated\r\non a hill on the right bank of the Surkhab.\r\n\r\nThe native princes, who claimed to be descended from Alexander the\r\nGreat, were till 1868 practically independent, though their allegiance\r\nwas claimed in an ineffective way by Khokand, but eventually Bokhara\r\ntook advantage of their intestine feuds to secure their real submission\r\nin 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAULI, or KEROWLEE, a native state of India, in the Rajputana agency.\r\nArea, 1242 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 156,786; estimated revenue about\r\nL330,000. Almost the entire territory is composed of hills and broken\r\nground, but there are no lofty peaks, the highest having an elevation of\r\nless than 1400 ft. above sea-level. The Chambal river flows along the\r\nsouth-east boundary of the state. Iron ore and building stone comprise\r\nthe mineral resources. The prevailing agricultural products are millets,\r\nwhich form the staple food of the people. The only manufactures consist\r\nof a little weaving, dyeing, wood-turning and stone-cutting. The\r\nprincipal imports are piece goods, salt, sugar, cotton, buffaloes and\r\nbullocks; the exports rice and goats. The feudal aristocracy of the\r\nstate consists of Jadu Rajputs connected with the ruling house. They pay\r\na tribute in lieu of constant military service, but in case of emergency\r\nor on occasions of state display they are bound to attend on the chief\r\nwith their retainers. The maharaja is the head of the clan, which claims\r\ndescent from Krishna. Maharaja Bhanwar Pal Deo, who was born in 1862 and\r\nsucceeded in 1866, was appointed G.C.I.E. in 1897, on the occasion of\r\nQueen Victoria's diamond jubilee.\r\n\r\nThe town of KARAULI had a population in 1901 of 23,482. It dates from\r\n1348, and is well situated in a position naturally defended by ravines\r\non the north and east, while it is further protected by a great wall.\r\nThe palace of the maharaja is a handsome block of buildings dating\r\nmainly from the middle of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAREN, one of the chief hill races of Burma. The Karens inhabit the\r\ncentral Pegu Yoma range, forming the watershed between the Sittang and\r\nIrrawaddy rivers, the Paunglaung range between the Sittang and the\r\nSalween, and the eastern slopes of the Arakan Yoma mountains to the west\r\nof the Irrawaddy delta. They are supposed to be the descendants of\r\nChinese tribes driven southwards by the pressure of the Shan races,\r\nbefore they were again made to retire into the hills by the expansion of\r\nthe Mon power. Their own traditions ascribe their original home to the\r\nwest of the sandy desert of Gobi stretching between China and Tibet.\r\nAccording to the census of 1901 they numbered in all 727,235 persons\r\nwithin British India, divided into the Sgaw, 86,434, the Pwo, 174,070,\r\nand the Bghai, 4936, while 457,355 are returned as \"unspecified.\" The\r\nSgaw and Pwo are collectively known as the \"White Karens,\" and chiefly\r\ninhabit British territory. They take their name from the colour of their\r\nclothes. The Bghai, or \"Red Karens,\" who are supposed by some to be an\r\nentirely distinct race, chiefly inhabit the independent hill state of\r\nKaren-ni (q.v.). The Karen is of a squarer build than the Burman, his\r\nskin is fairer, and he has more of the Mongolian obliquity of the eyes.\r\nIn character also the people differ from the Burmese. They are\r\nsingularly devoid of humour, they are stolid and cautious, and lack\r\naltogether the light gaiety and fascination of the Burmese. They are\r\nnoted for truthfulness and chastity, but are dirty and addicted to\r\ndrink. The White Karens furnish perhaps the most notable instance of\r\nconversion to Christianity of any native race in the British empire.\r\nPrepared by prophecies current among them, and by curious traditions of\r\na biblical flavour, in addition to their antagonism to the dominant\r\nBurmese, they embraced with fervour the new creed brought to them by the\r\nmissionaries, so that out of the 147,525 Christians in Burma according\r\nto the census of 1901 upwards of a hundred thousand were Karens. The Red\r\nKarens differ considerably from the White Karens. They are the wildest\r\nand most lawless of the so-called Karen tribes. Every male belonging to\r\nthe clan used to have the rising sun tattooed in bright vermilion on his\r\nback. The men are small and wizened, but athletic, and have broad\r\nreddish-brown faces. Their dress consists of a short pair of breeches,\r\nusually of a reddish colour, with black and white stripes interwoven\r\nperpendicularly or like a tartan, and a handkerchief is tied round the\r\nhead. The Karen language is tonal, and belongs to the Siamese-Chinese\r\nbranch of the Indo-Chinese family.\r\n\r\n  See D. M. Smeaton, _The Loyal Karens of Burma_ (1887); J. Nisbet,\r\n  _Burma under British Rule_ (1901); M. and B. Ferrars, _Burma_ (1900);\r\n  and O'Connor Scott, _The Silken East_ (1904).     (J. G. Sc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAREN-NI, the country of the Red Karens, a collection of small states,\r\nformerly independent, but now feudatory to Burma. It is situated\r\napproximately between 18 deg. 50' and 19 deg. 55' N. and between 97 deg.\r\n10' and 97 deg. 50' E. The tract is bounded on the N. by the Shan states\r\nof Mong Pai, Hsatung and Mawkmai; on the E. by Siam; on the S. by the\r\nPapun district of Lower Burma; and on the W. a stretch of mountainous\r\ncountry, inhabited by the Bre and various other small tribes, formerly\r\nin a state of independence, divides it from the districts of Toungoo and\r\nYamethin. It is divided in a general way into eastern and western\r\nKaren-ni; the former consisting of one state, Gantarawadi, with an\r\napproximate area of 2500 sq. m.; the latter of the four small states of\r\nKyebogyi, area about 350 sq. m.; Bawlake, 200 sq. m.; Nammekon, 50 sq.\r\nm.; and Naungpale, about 30 sq. m. The small states of western Karen-ni\r\nwere formerly all subject to Bawlake, but the subordination has now\r\nceased. Karen-ni consists of two widely differing tracts of country,\r\nwhich roughly mark now, and formerly actually did mark, the division\r\ninto east and west. Gantarawadi has, however, encroached westwards\r\nbeyond the boundaries which nature would assign to it. The first of\r\nthese two divisions is the southern portion of the valley of the Hpilu,\r\nor Balu stream, an open, fairly level plain, well watered and in some\r\nparts swampy. The second division is a series of chains of hills,\r\nintersected by deep valleys, through which run the two main rivers, the\r\nSalween and the Pawn, and their feeder streams. Many of the latter are\r\ndried up in the hot season and only flow freely during the rains. The\r\nwhole country being hilly, the most conspicuous ridge is that lying\r\nbetween the Pawn and the Salween, which has an average altitude of 5000\r\nft. It is crossed by several tracks, passable for pack-animals, the most\r\nin use being the road between Sawlon, the capital of Gantarawadi and Man\r\nMau. The principal peak east of the Salween is on the Loi Lan ridge,\r\n7109 ft. above mean sea-level. Parts of this ridge form the boundary\r\nbetween eastern Karen-ni and Mawkmai on the west and Siam on the east.\r\nIt falls away rapidly to the south, and at Pang Salang is crossed at a\r\nheight of 2200 ft. by the road from Hsataw to Mehawnghsawn. West of the\r\nBalu valley the continuation of the eastern rim of the Myelat plateau\r\nrises in Loi Nangpa to about 5000 ft. The Nam Pawn is a large river,\r\nwith an average breadth of 100 yds., but is unnavigable owing to its\r\nrocky bed. Even timber cannot be floated down it without the assistance\r\nof elephants. The Salween throughout Karen-ni is navigated by large\r\nnative craft. Its tributary, the Me Pai, on the eastern bank, is\r\nnavigable as far as Mehawnghsawn in Siamese territory. The Balu stream\r\nflows out of the Inle lake, and is navigable from that point to close on\r\nLawpita, where it sinks into the ground in a marsh or succession of\r\nfunnel holes. Its breadth averages 50 yds., and its depth is 15 ft. in\r\nsome places.\r\n\r\nThe chief tribes are the Red Karens (24,043), Bres (3500), and Padaungs\r\n(1867). Total revenue, Rs. 37,000. An agent of the British government,\r\nwith a guard of military police, is posted at the village of Loikaw.\r\nLittle of the history of the Red Karens is known; but it appears to be\r\ngenerally admitted that Bawlake was originally the chief state of the\r\nwhole country, east and west, but eastern Karen-ni under Papaw-gyi early\r\nbecame the most powerful. Slaving raids far into the Shan states brought\r\non invasions from Burma, which, however, were not very successful.\r\nEastern Karen-ni was never reduced until Sawlapaw, having defied the\r\nBritish government, was overcome and deposed by General Collett in the\r\nbeginning of 1889. Sawlawi was then appointed myoza, and received a\r\n_sanad_, or patent of appointment, on the same terms as the chiefs of\r\nthe Shan states. The independence of the Western Karen-ni states had\r\nbeen guaranteed by the British government in a treaty with King Mindon\r\nin 1875. They were, however, formally recognized as feudatories in 1892\r\nand were presented with _sanads_ on the 23rd of January of that year.\r\nGantarawadi pays a regular tribute of Rs. 5000 yearly, whereas these\r\nchieflets pay an annual _kadaw_, or _nuzzur_, of about Rs. 100. They are\r\nforbidden to carry out a sentence of death passed on a criminal without\r\nthe sanction of the superintendent of the southern Shan states, but\r\notherwise retain nearly all their customary law.\r\n\r\n  Tin, or what is called tin, is worked in Bawlake. It appears, however,\r\n  to be very impure. It is worked intermittently by White Karens on the\r\n  upper waters of the Hkemapyu stream. Rubies, spinels and other stones\r\n  are found in the upper Tu valley and in the west of Nammekon state,\r\n  but they are of inferior quality. The trade in teak is the chief or\r\n  only source of wealth in Karen-ni. The largest and most important\r\n  forests are those on the left bank of the Salween. Others lie on both\r\n  banks of the Nam Pawn, and in western Karen-ni on the Nam Tu. The\r\n  yearly out-turn is estimated at over 20,000 logs, and forest officers\r\n  have estimated that an annual out-turn of 9000 logs might be kept up\r\n  without injury to the forests. Some quantity of cutch is exported, as\r\n  also stick-lac, which the Red Karens graft so as to foster the\r\n  production. Other valuable forest produce exists, but is not exported.\r\n  Rice, areca-nuts, and betel-vine leaf are the chief agricultural\r\n  products. The Red Karen women weave their own and their husbands'\r\n  clothing. A characteristic manufacture is the _pa-si_ or Karen metal\r\n  drum, which is made at Ngwedaung. These drums are from 2(1/2) to 3 ft.\r\n  across the boss, with sides of about the same depth. The sound is out\r\n  of proportion to the metal used, and is inferior to that of the Shan\r\n  and Burmese gongs. It is thought that the population of Karen-ni is\r\n  steadily decreasing. The birth-rate of the people is considered to\r\n  exceed the death-rate by very little, and the Red Karen habit of life\r\n  is most unwholesome. Numbers have enlisted in the Burma police, but\r\n  there are various opinions as to their value.     (J. G. Sc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARIKAL, a French settlement in India, situated on the south-east coast,\r\nwithin the limits of Tanjore district, with an area of 53 sq. m., and a\r\npopulation (1901) of 56,595. The site was promised to the French by the\r\nTanjore raja in 1738, in return for services rendered, but was only\r\nobtained by them by force in 1739. It was captured by the British in\r\n1760, restored in 1765, again taken in 1768, and finally restored in\r\n1817. The town is neatly built on one of the mouths of the Cauvery, and\r\ncarries on a brisk trade with Ceylon, exporting rice and importing\r\nchiefly European articles and timber. A _chef de l'administration_,\r\nsubordinate to the government at Pondicherry, is in charge of the\r\nsettlement, and there is a tribunal of first instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARLI, a village of British India, in the Poona district of the Bombay\r\npresidency, famous for its rock caves. Pop. (1901), 903. The great cave\r\nof Karli is said by Fergusson to be without exception the largest and\r\nfinest _chaitya_ cave in India; it was excavated at a time when the\r\nstyle was in its greatest purity, and is splendidly preserved. The great\r\n_chaitya_ hall is 126 ft. long, 45 ft. 7 in. wide, and about 46 ft.\r\nhigh. A row of ornamental columns rises on either side to the ribbed\r\nteak roof, and at the far end of the nave is a massive _dagoba_. Dating\r\nfrom the beginning of the Christian era or earlier, this cave has a\r\nwooden roof, which repeats the pattern of the walls, and which Fergusson\r\nconsiders to be part of the original design. Since wood rapidly\r\ndeteriorates in India owing to the climate and the ravages of white\r\nants, the state of preservation of this roof is remarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARLOWITZ, or CARLOWITZ (Hungarian, _Karloeza_; Croatian, Karlovci), a\r\ncity of Croatia-Slavonia, in the county of Syrmia; on the right bank of\r\nthe Danube, and on the railway from Peterwardein, 6 m. N.W. to Belgrade.\r\nPop. (1900), 5643. Karlowitz is the seat of an Orthodox metropolitan,\r\nand has several churches and schools, and a hospital. The fruit-farms\r\nand vineyards of the Fruska Gora, a range of hills to the south, yield\r\nexcellent plum brandy and red wine. An obelisk at Slankamen, 13 m. E. by\r\nS., commemorates the defeat of the Turks by Louis of Baden, in 1691. The\r\ntreaty of Karlowitz, between Austria, Turkey, Poland and Venice, was\r\nconcluded in 1699; in 1848-1849 the city was the headquarters of Servian\r\nopposition to Hungary. It was included, until 1881, in the Military\r\nFrontier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSKRONA [CARLSCRONA,] a seaport of Sweden, on the Baltic coast, chief\r\ntown of the district (_lan_) of Blekinge, and headquarters of the\r\nSwedish navy. Pop. (1900), 23,955. It is pleasantly situated upon\r\nislands and the mainland, 290 m. S.S.W. of Stockholm by rail. The\r\nharbour is capacious and secure, with a sufficient depth of water for\r\nthe largest vessels. It has three entrances; the principal, and the only\r\none practicable for large vessels, is to the south of the town, and is\r\ndefended by two strong forts, at Drottningskar on the island of Aspo,\r\nand on the islet of Kungsholm. The dry docks, of great extent, are cut\r\nout of the solid granite. There is slip-accommodation for large vessels.\r\nKarlskrona is the seat of the Royal Naval Society, and has a\r\nnavy-arsenal and hospital, and naval and other schools. Charles XI., the\r\nfounder of the town as naval headquarters (1680), is commemorated by a\r\nbronze statue (1897). There are factories for naval equipments,\r\ngalvanized metal goods, felt hats, canvas, leather and rice, and\r\nbreweries and granite quarries. Exports are granite and timber; imports,\r\ncoal, flour, provisions, hides and machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSRUHE, or CARLSRUHE, a city of Germany, capital of the grand-duchy of\r\nBaden, 33 m. S.W. of Heidelberg, on the railway Frankfort-on-Main-Basel,\r\nand 39 m. N.W. of Stuttgart. Pop. (1895), 84,030; (1905), 111,200. It\r\nstands on an elevated plain, 5 m. E. of the Rhine and on the fringe of\r\nthe Hardtwald forest. Karlsruhe takes its name from Karl Wilhelm,\r\nmargrave of Baden, who, owing to disputes with the citizens of Durlach,\r\nerected here in 1715 a hunting seat, around which the town has been\r\nbuilt. The city is surrounded by beautiful parks and gardens. The palace\r\n(Schloss), built in 1751-1776 on the site of the previous erection of\r\n1715, is a plain building in the old French style, composed of a centre\r\nand two wings, presenting nothing remarkable except the octagon tower\r\n(_Bleiturm_), from the summit of which a splendid view of the city and\r\nsurrounding country is obtained, and the marble saloon, in which the\r\nmeridian of Cassini was fixed or drawn. In front of the palace is the\r\nGreat Circle, a semicircular line of buildings, containing the government\r\noffices. From the palace the principal streets, fourteen in number,\r\nradiate in the form of an expanded fan, in a S.E., S. and S.W. direction,\r\nand are again intersected by parallel streets. This fan-like plan of the\r\nolder city has, however, been abandoned in the more modern extensions.\r\nKarlsruhe has several fine public squares, the principal of which are the\r\nSchlossplatz, with Schwanthaler's statue of the grand duke Karl Friedrich\r\nin the centre, and market square (Marktplatz), with a fountain and a\r\nstatue of Louis, grand duke of Baden. In the centre of the Rondelplatz is\r\nan obelisk in honour of the grand duke Karl Wilhelm. The finest street is\r\nthe Kaiserstrasse, running from east to west and having a length of a\r\nmile and a half and a uniform breadth of 72 ft. In it are several of the\r\nchief public buildings, notably the technical high school, the arsenal\r\nand the post office. Among other notable buildings are the town hall; the\r\ntheatre; the hall of representatives; the mint; the joint museum of the\r\ngrand-ducal and national collections (natural history, archaeology,\r\nethnology, art and a library of over 150,000 volumes); the palace of the\r\nheir-apparent, a late Renaissance building of 1891-1896; the imperial\r\nbank (1893); the national industrial hall, with an exhibition of\r\nmachinery; the new law courts; and the hall of fine arts, which shelters\r\na good picture gallery. The city has six Evangelical and four Roman\r\nCatholic Churches. The most noteworthy of these are the Evangelical town\r\nchurch, the burial-place of the margraves of Baden; the Christuskirche,\r\nand the Bernharduskirche. Karlsruhe possesses further the Zahringen\r\nmuseum of curiosities, which is in the left wing of the Schloss; an\r\narchitectural school (1891); industrial art school and museum; cadet\r\nschool (1892); botanical and electro-technical institutes; and\r\nhorticultural and agricultural schools. Of its recent public monuments\r\nmay be mentioned one to Joseph Victor von Scheffel (1826-1886); a bronze\r\nequestrian statue of the emperor William I. (1896); and a memorial of the\r\n1870-71 war. Karlsruhe is the headquarters of the XIV. German army corps.\r\nSince 1870 the industry of the city has grown rapidly, as well as the\r\ncity itself. There are large railway workshops; and the principal\r\nbranches of industry are the making of locomotives, carriages, tools and\r\nmachinery, jewelry, furniture, gloves, cement, carpets, perfumery,\r\ntobacco and beer. There is an important arms factory. Maxau, on the\r\nRhine, serves as the river port of Karlsruhe and is connected with it by\r\na canal finished in 1901.\r\n\r\n  See Fecht, _Geschichte der Haupt- und Residenzstadt Karlsruhe_\r\n  (Karlsruhe, 1887); F. von Weech, _Karlsruhe, Geschichte der Stadt und\r\n  ihrer Verwaltung_ (Karlsruhe, 1893-1902); Naeher, _Die Umgebung der\r\n  Residenz Karlsruhe_ (Karlsruhe, 1888); and the annual _Chronik der\r\n  Haupt- und Residenzstadt Karlsruhe._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSTAD [CARLSTAD], a town of Sweden, the capital of the district\r\n(_lan_) of Vermland, on the island of Tingvalla under the northern shore\r\nof Lake Vener, 205 m. W. of Stockholm by the Christiania railway. Pop.\r\n(1900), 11,869. The fine Klar River here enters the lake, descending\r\nfrom the mountains of the frontier. To the north-west lies the Fryksdal\r\nor valley of the Nors River, containing three beautiful lakes and\r\nfancifully named the \"Swedish Switzerland.\" In this and other parts of\r\nthe district are numerous iron-works. Karlstad was founded in 1584. It\r\nis the seat of a bishop and has a cathedral. Trade is carried on by way\r\nof the lake and the Gota canal. There are mechanical works, match\r\nfactories and stockinet factories, and a mineral spring rich in iron,\r\nthe water of which is bottled for export. Under the constitution of\r\nunited Sweden and Norway, in the event of the necessity of electing a\r\nRegent and the disagreement of the parliaments of the two countries,\r\nKarlstad was indicated as the meeting-place of a delegacy for the\r\npurpose. Here, on the 31st of August 1905 the conference met to decide\r\nupon the severance of the union between Sweden and Norway, the delegates\r\nconcluding their work on the 23rd of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARLSTADT or CARLSTADT (Hungarian, _Karolyvaros_; Croatian, _Karlovac_),\r\na royal free city, municipality and garrison town in the county of\r\nAgram, Croatia-Slavonia; standing on hilly ground beside the river\r\nKulpa, which here receives the Korana and the Dobra. Pop. (1900), 7396.\r\nKarlstadt is on the railway from Agram to Fiume. It consists of the\r\nfortress, now obsolete, the inner town and the suburbs. Besides the\r\nRoman Catholic and Orthodox churches, its chief buildings are the\r\nFranciscan monastery, law-courts and several large schools, including\r\none for military cadets. Karlstadt has a considerable transit trade in\r\ngrain, wine, spirits and honey, and manufactures the liqueur called\r\n_rosoglio_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARMA, sometimes written KARMAN, a Sanskrit noun (from the root _kri_,\r\nto do), meaning deed or action. In addition to this simple meaning it\r\nhas also, both in the philosophical and the colloquial speech of India a\r\ntechnical meaning, denoting \"a person's deeds as determining his future\r\nlot.\" This is not merely in the vague sense that on the whole good will\r\nbe rewarded and evil punished, but that every single act must work out\r\nto the uttermost its inevitable consequences, and receive its\r\nretribution, however many ages the process may require. Every part of\r\nthe material universe--man, woman, insect, tree, stone, or whatever it\r\nbe--is the dwelling of an eternal spirit that is working out its\r\ndestiny, and while receiving reward and punishment for the past is\r\nlaying up reward and punishment for the future. This view of existence\r\nas an endless and concomitant sowing and reaping is accepted by learned\r\nand unlearned alike as accounting for those inequalities in human life\r\nwhich might otherwise lead men to doubt the justice of God. Every act of\r\nevery person has not only a moral value producing merit or demerit, but\r\nalso an inherent power which works out its fitting reward or punishment.\r\nTo the Hindu this does not make heaven and hell unnecessary. These two\r\nexist in many forms more or less grotesque, and after death the soul\r\npasses to one of them and there receives its due; but that existence too\r\nis marked by desire and action, and is therefore productive of merit or\r\ndemerit, and as the soul is thus still entangled in the meshes of karma\r\nit must again assume an earthly garb and continue the strife. Salvation\r\nis to the Hindu simply deliverance from the power of karma, and each of\r\nthe philosophic systems has its own method of obtaining it. The last\r\nbook of the Laws of Manu deals with _karmaphalam_, \"the fruit of karma,\"\r\nand gives many curious details of the way in which sin is punished and\r\nmerit rewarded. The origin of the doctrine cannot be traced with\r\ncertainty, but there is little doubt that it is post-vedic, and that it\r\nwas readily accepted by Buddha in the 6th century B.C. As he did not\r\nbelieve in the existence of soul he had to modify the doctrine (see\r\nBUDDHISM).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARMAN, JOZSEF (1769-1795), Hungarian author, was born at Losoncz on the\r\n14th of March 1769, the son of a Calvinist pastor. He was educated at\r\nLosoncz and Pest, whence he migrated to Vienna. There he made the\r\nacquaintance of the beautiful and eccentric Countess Markovics, who was\r\nfor a time his mistress, but she was not, as has often been supposed,\r\nthe heroine of his famous novel _Fanni Hagyomanai_ (Fanny's testament).\r\nSubsequently he settled in Pest as a lawyer. His sensibility, social\r\ncharm, liberal ideas (he was one of the earliest of the Magyar\r\nfreemasons) and personal beauty, opened the doors of the best houses to\r\nhim. He was generally known as the Pest Alcibiades, and was especially\r\nat home in the salons of the Protestant magnates. In 1792, together with\r\nCount Raday, he founded the first theatrical society at Buda. He\r\nmaintained that Pest, not Pressburg, should be the literary centre of\r\nHungary, and in 1794 founded the first Hungarian quarterly, _Urania_,\r\nbut it met with little support and ceased to exist in 1795, after three\r\nvolumes had appeared. Karman, who had long been suffering from an\r\nincurable disease, died in the same year. The most important\r\ncontribution to _Urania_ was his sentimental novel, _Fanni Hagyomanai_,\r\nmuch in the style of _La nouvelle Heloise_ and _Werther_, the most\r\nexquisite product of Hungarian prose in the 18th century and one of the\r\nfinest psychological romances in the literature. Karman also wrote two\r\nsatires and fragments of an historical novel, while his literary\r\nprogramme is set forth in his dissertation _Anemzet csinosodasa_.\r\n\r\n  Karman's collected works were published in Abafi's _Nemzeti Konyvtar_\r\n  (Pest, 1878), &c., preceded by a life of Karman. See F. Barath,\r\n  _Joseph Karman_ (Hung., Vas. Ujs, 1874); Zsolt Beothy, article on\r\n  Karman in _Kepes Irodalomtortenet_ (Budapest, 1894).     (R. N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARNAK, a village in Upper Egypt (pop. 1907, 12,585), which has given\r\nits name to the northern half of the ruins of Thebes on the east bank of\r\nthe Nile, the southern being known as Luxor (q.v.). The Karnak ruins\r\ncomprise three great enclosures built of crude brick. The northernmost\r\nand smallest of these contained a temple of the god Mont, built by\r\nAmenophis III., and restored by Rameses II. and the Ptolemies. Except a\r\nwell-preserved gateway dating from the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes I.,\r\nlittle more than the plan of the foundations is traceable. Its axis, the\r\nline of which is continued beyond the enclosure wall by an avenue of\r\nsphinxes, pointed down-stream (N.E.). The southern enclosure contained a\r\ntemple of the goddess Mut, also built by Amenophis III., and almost as\r\nruinous as the last, but on a much larger scale. At the back is the\r\nsacred lake in the shape of a horse-shoe. The axis of the temple runs\r\napproximately northward, and is continued by a great avenue of rams to\r\nthe southern pylons of the central enclosure. This last is of vast\r\ndimensions, forming approximately a square of 1500 ft., and it contains\r\nthe greatest of all known temples, the Karnak temple of Ammon (see\r\nARCHITECTURE, sect. \"Egyptian,\" with plan).\r\n\r\nInside and outside each of these enclosures there were a number of\r\nsubsidiary temples and shrines, mostly erected by individual kings to\r\nspecial deities. The triad of Thebes was formed by Ammon, his wife Mut\r\nand their son Khons. The large temple of Khons is in the enclosure of\r\nthe Ammon temple, and the temple of Mut, as already stated, is connected\r\nwith the latter by the avenue of rams. The Mont temple, on the other\r\nhand, is isolated from the others and turned away from them; it is\r\nsmaller than that of Khons. Mont, however, may perhaps be considered a\r\nspecial god of Thebes; he certainly was a great god from very ancient\r\ntimes in the immediate neighbourhood, his seats being about 4 m. N.E. at\r\nMedamot, the ancient Madu, and about 10 m. S.W. on the west bank at\r\nHermonthis.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that a temple of Ammon existed at Karnak under the Old\r\nKingdom, if not in the prehistoric age; but it was unimportant, and no\r\ntrace of it has been discovered. Slight remains of a considerable temple\r\nof the Middle Kingdom survive behind the shrine of the great temple, and\r\nnumbers of fine statues of the twelfth and later dynasties have been\r\nfound; two of these were placed against the later seventh pylon, while a\r\nlarge number were buried in a great pit, in the area behind that pylon,\r\nwhich has yielded an enormous number of valuable and interesting\r\nmonuments reaching to the age of the Ptolemies. The axis of the early\r\ntemple lay from E. to W., and was followed by the main line of the later\r\ngrowth; but at the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty, Amenophis I.\r\nbuilt a temple south of the west front of the old one, and at right\r\nangles to it, and thus started a new axis which was later developed in\r\nthe series of pylons VII.-X., and the avenue to the temple of Mut. The\r\nVIIIth pylon in particular was built by Hatshepsut, probably as an\r\napproach to this temple of Amenophis, but eventually Tethmosis III.\r\ncleared the latter away entirely. Thebes was then the royal residence,\r\nand Ammon of Karnak was the great god of the state. Tethmosis I. built a\r\ncourt round the temple of the Middle Kingdom, entered through a pylon\r\n(No. V.), and later added the pylon No. IV. with obelisks in front of\r\nit. Hatshepsut placed two splendid obelisks between the Pylons IV. and\r\nV., and built a shrine in the court of Tethmosis I., in front of the old\r\ntemple. Tethmosis III., greatest of the Pharaohs, remodelled the\r\nbuildings about the obelisks of his unloved sister with the deliberate\r\nintention of hiding them from view, and largely reconstructed the\r\nsurroundings of the court. At a later date, after his wars were over, he\r\naltered Hatshepsut's sanctuary, engraving on the walls about it a record\r\nof his campaigns; to this time also is to be attributed the erection of\r\na great festival hall at the back of the temple. The small innermost\r\npylon (No. VI.) is likewise the work of Tethmosis III. Amenophis III.,\r\nthough so great a builder at Thebes, seems to have contented himself\r\nwith erecting a great pylon (No. III.) at the west end. The closely\r\ncrowded succession of broad pylons here suggests a want of space for\r\nwestward expansion, and this is perhaps explained by a trace of a quay\r\nfound by Legrain in 1905 near the southern line of pylons; a branch of\r\nthe Nile or a large canal may have limited the growth. As has been\r\nstated, Tethmosis III. continued on the southern axis; he destroyed the\r\ntemple of Amenophis I. and erected a larger pylon (No. VII.) to the\r\nnorth of Hatshepsut's No. VIII. To these Haremheb added two great pylons\r\nand the long avenue of ram-figures, changing the axis slightly so as to\r\nlead direct to the temple of Mut built by Amenophis III. All of these\r\nsouthern pylons are well spaced. In the angle between these pylons and\r\nthe main temple was the great rectangular sacred lake. By this time the\r\ntemple of Karnak had attained to little more than half of its ultimate\r\nlength from east to west.\r\n\r\nWith the XIXth Dynasty there is a notable change perhaps due to the\r\nfilling of the hypothetical canal. No more was added on the southern\r\nline of building, but westward Rameses I. erected pylon No. II. at an\r\nample distance from that of Amenophis III., and Seti I. and Rameses II.\r\nutilized the space between for their immense Hall of Columns, one of the\r\nmost celebrated achievements of Egyptian architecture. The materials of\r\nwhich the pylon is composed bear witness to a temple having stood near\r\nby of the heretic and unacknowledged kings of the XVIIIth Dynasty.\r\nHaremheb's pylon No. IX. was likewise constructed out of the ruins of a\r\ntemple dedicated by Amenophis IV. (Akhenaten) to the sun-god Harmakhis.\r\nRameses III. built a fine temple, still well preserved, to Ammon at\r\nright angles to the axis westward of pylon No. II.; Sheshonk I. (Dynasty\r\nXXII.) commenced a great colonnaded court in front of the pylon,\r\nenclosing part of this temple and a smaller triple shrine built by Seti\r\nII. In the centre of the court Tirhaka (Tirhaka, Dynasty XXV.) set up\r\nhuge columns 64 ft. high, rivalling those of the central aisle in the\r\nHall of Columns, for some building now destroyed. A vast unfinished\r\npylon at the west end (No. I.), 370 ft. wide and 142(1/2) ft. high, is\r\nof later date than the court, and is usually attributed to the Ptolemaic\r\nage. It will be observed that the successive pylons diminish in size\r\nfrom the outside inwards. Portions of the solid crude-brick scaffolding\r\nare still seen banked against this pylon. About 100 metres west of it is\r\na stone quay, on the platform of which stood a pair of obelisks of Seti\r\nII.; numerous graffiti recording the height of the Nile from the XXIst\r\nto the XXVIth Dynasties are engraved on the quay.\r\n\r\nBesides the kings named above, numbers of others contributed in greater\r\nor less measure to the building or decoration of the colossal temple.\r\nAlexander the Great restored a chamber in the festival hall of Tethmosis\r\nIII., and Ptolemy Soter built the central shrine of granite in the name\r\nof Philip Arrhidaeus. The walls throughout, as usually in Egyptian\r\ntemples, are covered with scenes and inscriptions, many of these, such\r\nas those which record the annals of Tethmosis III., the campaign of Seti\r\nI. in Syria, the exploit of Rameses II. at the battle of Kadesh and his\r\ntreaty with the Hittites, and the dedication of Sheshonk's victories to\r\nAmmon, are of great historical importance. Several large stelae with\r\ninteresting inscriptions have been found in the ruins, and statues of\r\nmany ages of workmanship. In December 1903 M. Legrain, who has been\r\nengaged for several years in clearing the temple area systematically,\r\nfirst tapped an immense deposit of colossal statues, stelae and other\r\nvotive objects large and small in the space between pylon No. VII. and\r\nthe great hypostyle hall. After three seasons' work, much of it in deep\r\nwater, 750 large monuments have been extracted, while the small figures,\r\n&c. in bronze and other materials amount to nearly 20,000. The value of\r\nthe find, both from the artistic and historical standpoints, is immense.\r\nThe purpose of the deposit is still in doubt; many of the objects are of\r\nthe finest materials and finest workmanship, and in perfect\r\npreservation: even precious metals are not absent. Multitudes of objects\r\nin wood, ivory, &c., have decayed beyond recovery. That all were waste\r\npieces seems incredible. They are found lying in the utmost confusion;\r\nin date they range from the XIIth Dynasty to the Ptolemaic period.\r\n\r\nThe inundation annually reaches the floor of the temple, and the\r\nsaltpetre produced from the organic matter about the ruins, annually\r\nmelting and crystallizing, has disintegrated the soft sandstone in the\r\nlower courses of the walls and the lower drums and bases of the columns.\r\nThere is moreover no solid foundation in any part of the temple. Slight\r\nfalls of masonry have taken place from time to time, and the\r\naccumulation of rubbish was the only thing that prevented a great\r\ndisaster. Repairs, often on a large scale, have therefore gone on side\r\nby side with the clearance, especially since the fall of many columns in\r\nthe great hall in 1899. All the columns which fell in that year were\r\nre-erected by 1908.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Khons, in the S.W. corner of the great enclosure, is\r\napproached by an avenue of rams, and entered through a fine pylon\r\nerected by Euergetes I. It was built by Rameses III. and his successors\r\nof the XXth Dynasty, with Hrihor of Dynasty XXI. Excavations in the\r\nopposite S.E. corner have revealed flint weapons and other sepulchral\r\nremains of the earliest periods, proving that the history of Thebes goes\r\nback to a remote antiquity.\r\n\r\n  See Baedeker's _Handbook for Egypt_; also _Description de l'Egypte.\r\n  Atlas, Antiquites_ (tome iii.); A. Mariette, _Karnak, Etude\r\n  topographique et archeologique_; L. Borchardt, _Zur Baugeschichte des\r\n  Ammontempels von Karnak_; G. Legrain in _Recueil des travaux relatifs\r\n  a l'arch.

G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARNAL, a town and district of British India, in the Delhi division of\r\nthe Punjab. The town is 7 m. from the right bank of the Jumna, with a\r\nrailway station 76 m. N. of Delhi. Pop. (1901), 23,559. There are\r\nmanufactures of cotton cloth and boots, besides considerable local trade\r\nand an annual horse fair.\r\n\r\nThe DISTRICT OF KARNAL stretches along the right bank of the Jumna,\r\nnorth of Delhi. It is entirely an alluvial plain, but is crossed by the\r\nlow uplift of the watershed between the Indian Ocean and the Bay of\r\nBengal. Area, 3153 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 883,225, showing an increase of\r\nnearly 3% in the decade. The principal crops are millets, wheat, pulse,\r\nrice, cotton and sugar-cane. There are several factories for ginning and\r\npressing cotton. The district is traversed by the Delhi-Umballa-Kalka\r\nrailway, and also by the Western Jumna canal. It suffered from famine in\r\n1896-1897, and again to some extent in 1899-1900.\r\n\r\nNo district of India can boast of a more ancient history than Karnal, as\r\nalmost every town or stream is connected with the legends of the\r\n_Mahabharata_. The town of Karnal itself is said to owe its foundation\r\nto Raja Karna, the mythical champion of the Kauravas in the great war\r\nwhich forms the theme of the national epic. Panipat, in the south of the\r\ndistrict, is said to have been one of the pledges demanded from\r\nDuryodhana by Yudisthira as the price of peace in that famous conflict.\r\nIn historical times the plains of Panipat have three times proved the\r\ntheatre of battles which decided the fate of Upper India. It was here\r\nthat Ibrahim Lodi and his vast host were defeated in 1526 by the veteran\r\narmy of Baber; in 1556 Akbar reasserted the claims of his family on the\r\nsame battlefield against the Hindu general of the house of Adil Shah,\r\nwhich had driven the heirs of Baber from the throne for a brief\r\ninterval; and at Panipat too, on the 7th of January 1761, the Mahratta\r\nconfederation was defeated by Ahmad Shah Durani. During the troublous\r\nperiod which then ensued the Sikhs managed to introduce themselves, and\r\nin 1767 one of their chieftains, Desu Singh, appropriated the fort of\r\nKaithal, which had been built during the reign of Akbar. His\r\ndescendants, the bhais of Kaithal, were reckoned amongst the most\r\nimportant Cis-Sutlej princes. Different portions of this district have\r\nlapsed from time to time into the hands of the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAROLYI, ALOYS, COUNT (1825-1889), Austro-Hungarian diplomatist, was\r\nborn in Vienna on the 8th of August 1825. The greatness of the Hungarian\r\nfamily of Karolyi dates from the time of Alexander Karolyi (1668-1743),\r\none of the generals of Francis Rakoczy II., who in 1711 negotiated the\r\npeace of Szatmar between the insurgent Hungarians and the new king, the\r\nemperor Charles VI., was made a count of the Empire in 1712, and\r\nsubsequently became a field marshal in the imperial army. Aloys Karolyi\r\nentered the Austrian diplomatic service, and was attached successively\r\nto embassies at various European capitals. In 1858 he was sent to St\r\nPetersburg on a special mission to seek the support of Russia against\r\nNapoleon III. He was ambassador at Berlin in 1866 at the time of the\r\nrupture between Prussia and Austria, and after the Seven Weeks' War was\r\ncharged with the negotiation of the preliminaries of peace at\r\nNikolsburg. He was again sent to Berlin in 1871, acted as second\r\nplenipotentiary at the Berlin congress of 1878, and was sent in the same\r\nyear to London, where he represented Austria for ten years. He died on\r\nthe 2nd of December 1889 at Totmegyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAROSS, a cloak made of sheepskin, or the hide of other animals, with\r\nthe hair left on. It is properly confined to the coat of skin without\r\nsleeves worn by the Hottentots and Bushmen of South Africa. These\r\nkarosses are now often replaced by a blanket. Their chiefs wore karosses\r\nof the skin of the wild cat, leopard or caracal. The word is also\r\nloosely applied to the cloaks of leopard-skin worn by the chiefs and\r\nprincipal men of the Kaffir tribes. Kaross is probably either a genuine\r\nHottentot word, or else an adaptation of the Dutch _kuras_ (Portuguese\r\n_couraca_), a cuirass. In a vocabulary dated 1673 _karos_ is described\r\nas a \"corrupt Dutch word.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARR, JEAN BAPTISTE ALPHONSE (1808-1890), French critic and novelist,\r\nwas born in Paris, on the 24th of November 1808, and after being\r\neducated at the College Bourbon, became a teacher there. In 1832 he\r\npublished a novel, _Sous les tilleuls_, characterized by an attractive\r\noriginality and a delightful freshness of personal sentiment. A second\r\nnovel, _Une heure trop tard_, followed next year, and was succeeded by\r\nmany other popular works. His _Vendredi soir_ (1835) and _Le Chemin le\r\nplus court_ (1836) continued the vein of autobiographical romance with\r\nwhich he had made his first success. _Genevieve_ (1838) is one of his\r\nbest stories, and his _Voyage autour de mon jardin_ (1845) was\r\ndeservedly popular. Others were _Feu Bressier_ (1848), and _Fort en\r\ntheme_ (1853), which had some influence in stimulating educational\r\nreform. In 1839 Alphonse Karr, who was essentially a brilliant\r\njournalist, became editor of _Le Figaro_, to which he had been a\r\nconstant contributor; and he also started a monthly journal, _Les\r\nGuepes_, of a keenly satirical tone, a publication which brought him the\r\nreputation of a somewhat bitter wit. His epigrams were frequently\r\nquoted; e.g. \"plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose,\" and, on the\r\nproposal to abolish capital punishment, \"je veux bien que messieurs les\r\nassassins commencent.\" In 1848 he founded _Le Journal_. In 1855 he went\r\nto live at Nice, where he indulged his predilections for floriculture,\r\nand gave his name to more than one new variety. Indeed he practically\r\nfounded the trade in cut flowers on the Riviera. He was also devoted to\r\nfishing, and in _Les Soirees de Sainte-Adresse_ (1853) and _Au bord de\r\nla mer_ (1860) he made use of his experiences. His reminiscences, _Livre\r\nde bord_, were published in 1879-1880. He died at St Raphael (Var), on\r\nthe 29th of September 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARRER, FELIX (1825-1903), Austrian geologist, was born in Venice on the\r\n11th of March 1825. He was educated in Vienna, and served for a time in\r\nthe war department, but he retired from the public service at the age of\r\nthirty-two, and devoted himself to science. He made especial studies of\r\nthe Tertiary formations and fossils of the Vienna Basin, and\r\ninvestigated the geological relations of the thermal and other springs\r\nin that region. He became an authority on the foraminifera, on which\r\nsubject he published numerous papers. He wrote also a little book\r\nentitled _Der Boden der Hauptstadte Europas_ (1881). He died in Vienna\r\non the 19th of April 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARROO, two extensive plateaus in the Cape province, South Africa, known\r\nrespectively as the Great and Little Karroo. Karroo is a corruption of\r\n_Karusa_, a Hottentot word meaning dry, barren, and its use as a\r\nplace-name indicates the character of the plateaus so designated. They\r\nform the two intermediate \"steps\" between the coast-lands and the inner\r\nplateau which constitutes the largest part of South Africa. The Little\r\n(also called Southern) Karroo is the table-land nearest the southern\r\ncoast-line of the Cape, and is bounded north by the Zwaarteberg, which\r\nseparates it from the Great Karroo. From west to east the Little Karroo\r\nhas a length of some 200 m., whilst its average width is 30 m. West of\r\nthe Zwaarteberg the Little Karroo merges into the Great Karroo. Eastward\r\nit is limited by the hills which almost reach the sea in the direction\r\nof St Francis and Algoa Bays. The Great Karroo is of much larger extent.\r\nBounded south, as stated, by the Zwaarteberg, further east by the\r\nZuurberg (of the coast chain), its northern limit is the mountain range\r\nwhich, under various names, such as Nieuwveld and Sneeuwberg, forms the\r\nwall of the inner plateau. To the south-west and west it is bounded by\r\nthe Hex River Mountains and the Cold Bokkeveld, eastward by the Great\r\nFish River. West to east it extends fully 350 m. in a straight line,\r\nvarying in breadth from more than 80 to less than 40 m. Whilst the\r\nLittle Karroo is divided by a chain of hills which run across it from\r\neast to west, and varies in altitude from 1000 to 2000 ft., the Great\r\nKarroo has more the aspect of a vast plain and has a level of from 2000\r\nto 3000 ft. The total area of the Karroo plateaus is stated to be over\r\n100,000 sq. m. The plains are dotted with low ranges of _kopjes_. The\r\nchief characteristics of the Karroo are the absence of running water\r\nduring a great part of the year and the consequent parched aspect of the\r\ncountry. There is little vegetation save stunted shrubs, such as the\r\nmimosa (which generally marks the river beds), wild pomegranate, and wax\r\nheaths, known collectively as Karroo bush. After the early rains the\r\nbush bursts into gorgeous purple and yellow blossoms and vivid greens,\r\naffording striking evidence of the fertility of the soil. Such parts of\r\nthe Karroo as are under perennial irrigation are among the most\r\nproductive lands in South Africa. Even the parched bush provides\r\nsufficient nourishment for millions of sheep and goats. There are also\r\nnumerous ostrich farms, in particular in the districts of Oudtshoorn and\r\nLadismith in the Little Karroo, where lucerne grows with extraordinary\r\nluxuriance. The Karroo is admirably adapted to sufferers from pulmonary\r\ncomplaints. The dryness of the air tempers the heat of summer, which\r\nreaches in January a mean maximum of 87 deg. F., whilst July, the\r\ncoldest month, has a mean minimum of 36 deg. F. A marked feature of the\r\nclimate is the great daily range (nearly 30 deg.) in temperature; the\r\nKarroo towns are also subject to violent dust storms. Game, formerly\r\nplentiful, has been, with the exception of buck, almost exterminated. In\r\na looser sense the term Karroo is also used of the vast northern plains\r\nof the Cape which are part of the inner table-land of the continent.\r\n(See CAPE COLONY.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARS, a province of Russian Transcaucasia, having the governments of\r\nKutais and Tiflis on the N., those of Tiflis and Erivan on the E., and\r\nAsiatic Turkey on the S. and W. Its area amounts to 7410 sq. m. It is a\r\nmountainous, or rather a highland, country, being in reality a plateau,\r\nwith ranges of mountains running across it. The northern border is\r\nformed by the Arzyan range, a branch of the Ajari Mts., which attains\r\naltitudes of over 9000 ft. In the south the Kara-dagh reach 10,270 ft.\r\nin Mount Ala-dagh, and the Agry-dagh 10,720 ft. in Mount Ashakh; and in\r\nthe middle Allah-akhbar rises to 10,215 ft. The passes which connect\r\nvalley with valley often lie at considerable altitudes, the average of\r\nthose in the S.E. being 9000 ft. Chaldir-gol (altitude 6520 ft.) and one\r\nor two other smaller lakes lie towards the N.E.; the Chaldir-gol is\r\noverhung on the S.W. by the Kysyr-dagh (10,470 ft.). The east side of\r\nthe province is throughout demarcated by the Arpa-chai, which receives\r\nfrom the right the Kars river, and as it leaves the province at its S.E.\r\ncorner joins the Aras. The Kura rises within the province not far from\r\nthe Kysyr-dagh and flows across it westwards, then eastwards and\r\nnorth-eastwards, quitting it in the north-east. The winters are very\r\nsevere. The towns of Kaghyshman (4620 ft.) and Sarykamish (7800 ft.)\r\nhave a winter temperature like that of Finland, and at the latter place,\r\nwith an annual mean (35 deg. F.) equal to that of Hammerfest in the\r\nextreme north of Norway, the thermometer goes down in winter to 40 deg.\r\nbelow zero and rises in summer to 99 deg. The annual mean temperature at\r\nKars is 40.5 deg. and at Ardahan, farther north, 37 deg. The Alpine\r\nmeadows (_yailas_) reach up to 1000 ft. and afford excellent pasturage\r\nin spring and summer. The province is almost everywhere heavily\r\nforested. Firs and birches flourish as high as 7000 ft., and the vine up\r\nto above 3000 ft. Cereals ripen well, and barley and maize grow up to\r\nconsiderable altitudes. Large numbers of cattle and sheep are bred.\r\nExtensive deposits of salt occur at Kaghyshman and Olty. The population\r\nwas 167,610 in 1883 and 292,863 in 1897. The estimated population in\r\n1906 was 349,100. It is mixed. In remote antiquity the province was\r\ninhabited by Armenians, the ruins of whose capital, Ani, attest the\r\nancient prosperity of the country. To the Armenians succeeded the Turks,\r\nwhile Kurds invaded the Alpine pasturages above the valley of the Aras;\r\nand after them Kabardians, Circassians, Ossetes and Kara-papaks\r\nsuccessively found a refuge in this highland region. After the\r\nRusso-Turkish War of 1877-78, when this region was transferred to Russia\r\nby the treaty of Berlin, some 82,750 Turks emigrated to Asia Minor,\r\ntheir places being taken by nearly 22,000 Armenians, Greeks and\r\nRussians. At the census of 1897 the population consisted principally of\r\nArmenians (73,400), Kurds (43,000), Greeks (32,600), Kara-papaks\r\n(30,000), Russians, Turks and Persians. The capital is Kars. The\r\nprovince is divided into four districts, the chief towns of which are\r\nKars (q.v.), Ardahan (pop. 800 in 1897), Kaghyshman (3435) and Olty.\r\n     (J. T. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARS, a fortified town of Russian Transcaucasia, in the province of\r\nKars, formerly at the head of a sanjak in the Turkish vilayet of\r\nErzerum. It is situated in 40 deg. 37' N. and 43 deg. 6' E., 185 m. by\r\nrail S.W. of Tiflis, on a dark basalt spur of the Soghanli-dagh, above\r\nthe deep ravine of the Kars-chai, a sub-tributary of the Aras. Pop.\r\n(1878), 8672; (1897), 20,891. There are three considerable\r\nsuburbs--Orta-kapi to the S., Bairam Pasha to the E., and Timur Pasha on\r\nthe western side of the river. At the N.W. corner of the town,\r\noverhanging the river, is the ancient citadel, in earlier times a strong\r\nmilitary post, but completely commanded by the surrounding eminences.\r\nThe place is, however, still defended by a fort and batteries. There is\r\na 10th century cathedral, Kars being the see of a bishop of the Orthodox\r\nGreek Church. Coarse woollens, carpets and felt are manufactured.\r\n\r\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries the seat of an independent Armenian\r\nprincipality, Kars was captured and destroyed by the Seljuk Turks in the\r\n11th century, by the Mongols in the 13th, and by Timur (Tamerlane) in\r\n1387. The citadel, it would appear, was built by Sultan Murad III.\r\nduring the war with Persia, at the close of the 16th century. It was\r\nstrong enough to withstand a siege by Nadir Shah of Persia, in 1731, and\r\nin 1807 it successfully resisted the Russians. After a brave defence it\r\nsurrendered on the 23rd of June 1828 to the Russian general Count I. F.\r\nPaskevich, 11,000 men becoming prisoners of war. During the Crimean War\r\nthe Turkish garrison, guided by General Williams (Sir W. Fenwick\r\nWilliams of Kars) and other foreign officers, kept the Russians at bay\r\nduring a protracted siege; but, after the garrison had been devastated\r\nby cholera, and food had utterly failed, nothing was left but to\r\ncapitulate (Nov. 1855). The fortress was again stormed by the Russians\r\nin the war of 1877-78, and on its conclusion was transferred to Russia.\r\n\r\n  See Kmety, _The Defence of Kars_ (1856), translated from the German;\r\n  H.

S.E. of the\r\ncity of Bokhara, in a plain at the junction of two main confluents of\r\nthe Kashka-darya. It is a large and straggling place, with a citadel,\r\nand the population amounts to 25,000. There are three colleges, and the\r\nBiki mosque is a fine building inlaid with blue and white tiles. Along\r\nthe river stretches a fine promenade sheltered by poplars. Poppies and\r\ntobacco are largely grown, the tobacco being deemed the best in Central\r\nAsia. There is a considerable trade in grain; but the commercial\r\nprosperity of Karshi is mainly due to its being a meeting-point for the\r\nroads from Samarkand, Bokhara, Hissar, Balkh and Maimana, and serves as\r\nthe market where the Turkomans and Uzbegs dispose of their carpets,\r\nknives and firearms. Its coppersmiths turn out excellent work. Karshi\r\nwas a favourite residence of Timur (Tamerlane).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARST, in physical geography, the region east of the northern part of\r\nthe Adriatic. It is composed of high and dry limestone ridges. The\r\ncountry is excessively faulted by a long series of parallel fractures\r\nthat border the N.E. Adriatic and continue inland that series of steps\r\nwhich descend beneath the sea and produce the series of long parallel\r\nislands off the coast of Triest and along the Dalmatian shore. It has\r\nbeen shown by E. Suess (_Antlitz der Erde_, vol. i. pt. 2, ch. iii.)\r\nthat the N. Adriatic is a sunken dish that has descended along these\r\nfractures and folds, which are not uncommonly the scene of earthquakes,\r\nshowing that these movements are still in progress. The crust is very\r\nmuch broken in consequence and the water sinks readily through the\r\nbroken limestone rocks, which owing to their nature are also very\r\nabsorbent. The result is that the scenery is barren and desolate, and as\r\nthis structure always, wherever found, gives rise to similar features, a\r\nlandscape of this character is called a Karst landscape. The water\r\nrunning in underground channels dissolves and denudes away the\r\nunderlying rock, producing great caves as at Adelsberg, and breaking the\r\nsurface with sinks, potholes and unroofed chasms. The barren nature of a\r\npurely limestone country is seen in the treeless regions of some parts\r\nof Derbyshire, while the underground streams and sinks of parts of\r\nYorkshire, and the unroofed gorge formed by the Cheddar cliffs, give\r\nsome indication of the action that in the high fractured mountains of\r\nthe Karst produces a depressing landscape which has some of the features\r\nof the \"bad lands\" of America, though due to a different cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARSTEN, KARL JOHANN BERNHARD (1782-1853), German mineralogist, was born\r\nat Butzow in Mecklenburg, on the 26th of November 1782. He was author of\r\nseveral comprehensive works, including _Handbuch der Eisenhuttenkunde_\r\n(2 vols., 1816; 3rd ed., 1841); _System der Metallurgie geschichtlich,\r\nstatistisch, theoretisch und technisch_ (5 vols. with atlas, 1831-1832);\r\n_Lehrbuch der Salinenkunde_ (2 vols., 1846-1847). He was well known as\r\neditor of the _Archiv fur Bergbau und Huttenwesen_ (20 vols.,\r\n1818-1831); and (with H. von Dechen) of the _Archiv fur Mineralogie,\r\nGeognosie, Bergbau und Huttenkunde_ (26 vols., 1820-1854). He died at\r\nBerlin on the 22nd of August 1853. His son, Dr Hermann Karsten\r\n(1809-1877), was professor of mathematics and physics in the university\r\nof Rostock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARTIKEYA, in Hindu mythology, the god of war. Of his birth there are\r\nvarious legends. One relates that he had no mother but was produced by\r\nSiva alone, and was suckled by six nymphs of the Ganges, being\r\nmiraculously endowed with six faces that he might simultaneously obtain\r\nnourishment from each. Another story is that six babes, miraculously\r\nconceived, were born of the six nymphs, and that Parvati, the wife of\r\nSiva, in her great affection for them, embraced the infants so closely\r\nthat they became one, but preserved six faces, twelve arms, feet, eyes,\r\n&c. Kartikeya became the victor of giants and the leader of the armies\r\nof the gods. He is represented as riding a peacock. In southern India he\r\nis known as Subramanya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARUN, an important river of Persia. Its head-waters are in the mountain\r\ncluster known since at least the 14th century as Zardeh Kuh (13,000 ft.)\r\nand situated in the Bakhtiari country about 115 m. W. of Isfahan. In its\r\nupper course until it reaches Shushter it is called Ab i Kurang (also\r\nKurand and Kuran), and in the _Bundahish_, an old cosmographical work in\r\nPahlavi, it is named Kharae.[1] From the junction of the two principal\r\nsources in the Zardeh Kuh at an altitude of about 8000 ft., the Ab i\r\nKurang is a powerful stream, full, deep and flowing with great velocity\r\nfor most of its upper course between precipices varying in height from\r\n1000 to 3000 ft. The steepness and height of its banks make it in\r\ngeneral useless for irrigation purposes. From its principal sources to\r\nShushter the distance as the crow flies is only about 75 m., but the\r\ncourse of the river is so tortuous that it travels 250 m. before it\r\nreaches that city. Besides being fed on its journey through the\r\nBakhtiari country by many mountain-side streams, fresh-water and salt,\r\nit receives various tributaries, the most important being the Ab i\r\nBazuft from the right and the Ab i Barz from the left. At Shushter it\r\ndivides into two branches, one the \"Gerger,\" an artificial channel cut\r\nin olden times and flowing east of the city, the other the \"Shutait\"\r\nflowing west. These two branches, which are navigable to within a few\r\nmiles below Shushter, unite after a run of about 50 m. at Band i Kir, 24\r\nm. S. of Shushter, and there also take up the Ab i Diz (river of\r\nDizful). From Band i Kir to a point two miles above Muhamrah the river\r\nis called Karun (Rio Carom of the Portuguese writers of the 16th and\r\n17th centuries) and is navigable all the way with the exception of about\r\ntwo miles at Ahvaz, where a series of cliffs and rocky shelves cross the\r\nriver and cause rapids. Between Ahvaz and Band i Kir (46 m. by river, 24\r\nm. by road) the river has an average depth of about 20 ft., but below\r\nAhvaz down to a few miles above Muhamrah it is in places very shallow,\r\nand vessels with a draught exceeding 3 ft. are liable to ground. About\r\n12 m. above Muhamrah and branching off to the left is a choked-up river\r\nbed called the \"blind Karun,\" by which the Karun found its way to the\r\nsea in former days. Ten miles farther a part of the river branches off\r\nto the left and due S. by a channel called Bahmashir (from\r\nBahman-Ardashir, the name of the district in the early middle ages)\r\nwhich is navigable to the sea for vessels of little draught. The\r\nprincipal river, here about a quarter of a mile broad and 20 to 30 ft.\r\ndeep, now flows west, and after passing Muhamrah enters into the Shatt\r\nel Arab about 20 m. below Basra. This part of the river, from the\r\nBahmashir to the Shatt, is a little over three miles in length and, as\r\nits name, Hafar (\"dug\") implies, an artificial channel. It was dug c.\r\nA.D. 980 by Azud ed-Dowleh to facilitate communication by water between\r\nBasra and Ahvaz, as related by the Arab geographer Mukaddasi A.D. 986.\r\nThe total length of the river is 460 to 470 m. while the distance from\r\nthe sources to its junction with the Shatt el Arab is only 160 m. as the\r\ncrow flies. The Karun up to Ahvaz was opened to international navigation\r\non the 30th of October 1888, and Messrs Lynch of London established a\r\nfortnightly steamer service on it immediately after.\r\n\r\nTo increase the water supply of Isfahan Shah Tahmasp I. (1524-1576) and\r\nsome of his successors, notably Shah Abbas I. (1587-1629), undertook\r\nsome works for diverting the Kurang into a valley which drains into the\r\nZayendeh-rud, the river of Isfahan, by tunnelling, or cutting through a\r\nnarrow rocky ridge separating the two river systems. The result of many\r\nyears' work, a cleft 300 yds. long, 15 broad and 18 deep, cut into the\r\nrock, probably amounting to no more than one-twentieth of the necessary\r\nwork, can be seen at the junction of the two principal sources of the\r\nKurang.\r\n\r\n  On the upper Karun see Mrs Bishop, _Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan_\r\n  (London, 1891); Lord Curzon, _Persia and the Persian Question_\r\n  (London, 1892); Lieut.-Colonel H.

H.-S.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The _real_ principal source of the river has been correctly\r\n    located at ten miles above the _reputed_ principal source, but the\r\n    name Kurang has been erroneously explained as standing for Kuh i rang\r\n    and has been given to the mountain with the real principal source.\r\n    Kuh i rang has been wrongly explained as meaning the \"variegated\r\n    mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARWAR, or CARWAR, a seaport of British India, administrative\r\nheadquarters of North Kanara district in the Bombay presidency; 295 m.\r\nS. of Bombay city. Pop. (1901), 16,847. As early as 1660 the East India\r\nCompany had a factory here, with a trade in muslin and pepper; but it\r\nsuffered frequently from Dutch, Portuguese and native attacks, and in\r\n1752 the English agent was withdrawn. Old Karwar fell into ruins, but a\r\nnew town grew up after the transfer of North Kanara to the Bombay\r\npresidency. It is the only safe harbour all the year round between\r\nBombay and Cochin. In the bay is a cluster of islets called the Oyster\r\nRocks, on the largest of which is a lighthouse. Two smaller islands in\r\nthe bay afford good shelter to native craft during the strong north-west\r\nwinds that prevail from February to April. The commercial importance of\r\nKarwar has declined since the opening of the railway to Marmagao in\r\nPortuguese territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARWI, a town of British India, in the Banda district of the United\r\nProvinces, on a branch of the Indian Midland railway; pop. (1901), 7743.\r\nBefore the Mutiny it was the residence of a Mahratta noble, who lived in\r\ngreat state, and whose accumulations constituted the treasure afterwards\r\nfamous as \"the Kirwee and Banda Prize Money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARYOGAMY (Gr. [Greek: karuon], nut or kernel, thus \"nucleus,\" and\r\n[Greek: gamos], marriage), in biology: (1) the fusion of nuclei to form\r\na single nucleus in syngamic processes (see REPRODUCTION); (2) the\r\nprocess of pairing in Infusoria (q.v.), in which two migratory nuclei\r\nare interchanged and fuse with two stationary nuclei, while the\r\ncytoplasmic bodies of the two mates are in intimate temporary union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASAI, or CASSAI, a river of Africa, the chief southern affluent of the\r\nCongo. It enters the main stream in 3 deg. 10' S., 16 deg. 16' E. after\r\na course of over 800 m. from its source in the highlands which form the\r\nsouth-western edge of the Congo basin--separating the Congo and Zambezi\r\nsystems. The Kasai and its many tributaries cover a very large part of\r\nthe Congo basin. The Kasai rises in about 12 deg. S., 19 deg. E. and\r\nflows first in a north-easterly direction. About 10 deg. 35' S., 22 deg.\r\n15' E. it makes a rectangular bend northward and then takes a\r\nnorth-westerly direction. Five rivers--the Luembo, Chiumbo, Luijimo or\r\nLuashimo, Chikapa and Lovua or Lowo--rise west of the Kasai and run in\r\nparallel courses for a considerable distance, falling successively into\r\nthe parent stream (between 7 deg. and 6 deg. S.) as it bends westward in\r\nits northern course. The Luembo and Chiumbo join and enter the Kasai as\r\none river. A number of rapids occur in these streams. A few miles below\r\nthe confluence of the Lowo, the last of the five rivers named to join\r\nthe Kasai, the main stream is interrupted by the Wissmann Falls which,\r\nthough not very high, bar further navigation from the north. Below this\r\npoint the river receives several right-hand (eastern) tributaries. These\r\nalso have their source in the Zambezi-Congo watershed, rising just north\r\nof 12 deg. S., flowing north in parallel lines, and in their lower\r\ncourse bending west to join the Kasai. The chief of these affluents are\r\nthe Lulua and the Sankuru, the Lulua running between the Kasai and the\r\nSankuru. The Sankuru makes a bold curve westward on reaching 4 deg. S.,\r\nfollowing that parallel of latitude a considerable distance. Its waters\r\nare of a bright yellow colour. After the junction of the two rivers (in\r\n4 deg. 17' S., 20 deg. 15' E.), the united stream of the Kasai flows\r\nN.W. to the Congo. From the south it is joined by the Loange and the\r\nKwango. The Kwango is a large river rising a little north of 12 deg. S.,\r\nand west of the source of the Kasai. Without any marked bends it flows\r\nnorth--is joined from the east by the Juma, Wamba and other streams--and\r\nhas a course of 600 m. before joining the Kasai in 3 deg. S., 18' E. The\r\nlower reaches of the Kwango are navigable; the upper course is\r\ninterrupted by rapids. On the north (in 3 deg. 8' S., 17 deg. E.) the\r\nlower Kasai is joined by the Lukenye or Ikatta. This river, the most\r\nnortherly affluent of the Kasai, rises between 24 deg. and 25 deg. E.,\r\nand about 3 deg. S. in swampy land through which the Lomami (another\r\nCongo affluent) flows northward. The Lukenye has an east to west\r\ndirection flowing across a level country once occupied by a lake, of\r\nwhich Lake Leopold II. (q.v.), connected with the lower course of the\r\nLukenye, is the scanty remnant. Below the lake the Lukenye is known as\r\nthe Mfini. Near its mouth the Kasai, in its lower course generally a\r\nbroad stream strewn with islands, is narrowed to about half a mile on\r\npassing through a gap in the inner line of the West African highlands,\r\nby the cutting of which the old lake of the Kasai basin must have been\r\ndrained. The Kasai enters the Congo with a minimum depth of 25 feet and\r\na breadth of about 700 yards, at a height of 942 ft. above the sea. The\r\nconfluence is known as the Kwa mouth, Kwa being an alternative name for\r\nthe lower Kasai. The volume of water entering the Congo averages 321,000\r\ncub. ft. per second: far the largest amount discharged by any of the\r\nCongo affluents. In floodtime the current flows at the rate of 5 or 6 m.\r\nan hour. The Kasai and its tributaries are navigable for over 1500 m. by\r\nsteamer.\r\n\r\n  The Kwango affluent of the Kasai was the first of the large affluents\r\n  of the Congo known to Europeans. It was reached by the Portuguese from\r\n  their settlements on the west coast in the 16th century. Of its lower\r\n  course they were ignorant. Portuguese travellers in the 18th century\r\n  are believed to have reached the upper Kasai, but the first accurate\r\n  knowledge of the river basin was obtained by David Livingstone, who\r\n  reached the upper Kasai from the east and explored in part the upper\r\n  Kwango (1854-1855). V. L. Cameron and Paul Pogge crossed the upper\r\n  Kasai in the early \"seventies.\" The Kwa mouth was seen by H. M.\r\n  Stanley in his journey down the Congo in 1877, and he rightly regarded\r\n  it as the outlet of the Kwango, though not surmising it was also the\r\n  outlet of the Kasai. In 1882 Stanley ascended the river to the\r\n  Kwango-Kasai confluence and thence proceeding up the Mfini discovered\r\n  Lake Leopold II. In 1884 George Grenfell journeyed up the river beyond\r\n  the Kwango confluence. The systematic exploration of the main stream\r\n  and its chief tributaries was, however, mainly the work of Hermann von\r\n  Wissmann, Ludwig Wolf, Paul Pogge and other Germans during 1880-1887.\r\n  (See Wissmann's books, especially _Im Innern Afrikas_, Leipzig, 1888.)\r\n  On his third journey, 1886, Wissmann was accompanied by Grenfell.\r\n  Major von Mechow, an Austrian, explored the middle Kwango in 1880, and\r\n  its lower course was subsequently surveyed by Grenfell and Holman\r\n  Bentley, a Baptist missionary. In 1899-1900 a Belgian expedition under\r\n  Captain C. Lemaire traced the Congo-Zambezi watershed, obtaining\r\n  valuable information concerning the upper courses of the southern\r\n  Kasai tributaries. The upper Kasai basin and its peoples were further\r\n  investigated by a Hungarian traveller, E. Torday, in 1908-1909. (See\r\n  Torday's paper in _Geog. Jour._, 1910; also CONGO and the authorities\r\n  there cited.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASBEK (Georgian, _Mkin-vari_; Ossetian, _Urs-khokh_), one of the chief\r\nsummits of the Caucasus, situated in 42 deg. 42' N. and 44 deg. 30' E.,\r\n7 m. as the crow flies from a station of the same name on the high road\r\nto Tiflis. Its altitude is 16,545 ft. It rises on the range which runs\r\nnorth of the main range (main water-parting), and which is pierced by\r\nthe gorges of the Ardon and the Terek. It represents an extinct volcano,\r\nbuilt up of trachyte and sheathed with lava, and has the shape of a\r\ndouble cone, whose base lies at an altitude of 5800 ft. Owing to the\r\nsteepness of its slopes, its eight glaciers cover an aggregate surface\r\nof not more than 8 sq. m., though one of them, Maliev, is 36 m. long.\r\nThe best-known glacier is the Dyevdorak, or Devdorak, which creeps down\r\nthe north-eastern slope into a gorge of the same name, reaching a level\r\nof 7530 ft. At its eastern foot runs the Georgian military road through\r\nthe pass of Darial (7805 ft.). The summit was first climbed in 1868 by\r\nD. W. Freshfield, A. W. Moore, and C. Tucker, with a Swiss guide.\r\nSeveral successful ascents have been made since, the most valuable in\r\nscientific results being that of Pastukhov (1889) and that of G.\r\nMerzbacher and L. Purtscheller in 1890. Kasbek has a great literature,\r\nand has left a deep mark in Russian poetry.\r\n\r\n  See D. W. Freshfield in _Proc. Geog.

It\r\nis divided into the two districts _germsir_, the \"warm,\" and _sardsir_,\r\nthe \"cold,\" the former with the city of Kashan in the plains, the latter\r\nin the hills. It has a population of 75,000 to 80,000, and pays a yearly\r\nrevenue of about L18,000. KASHAN (Cashan) is the provincial capital, in\r\n34 deg. 0' N. and 51 deg. 27' E., at an elevation of 3190 ft., 150 m.\r\nfrom Teheran; pop. 35,000, including a few hundred Jews occupied as\r\nsilk-winders, and a few Zoroastrians engaged in trade. Great quantities\r\nof silk stuffs, from raw material imported from Gilan, and copper\r\nutensils are manufactured at Kashan and sent to all parts of Persia.\r\nKashan also exports rose-water made in villages in the hilly districts\r\nabout 20 m. from the city, and is the only place in Persia where cobalt\r\ncan be obtained, from the mine at Kamsar, 19 m. to the south. At the\r\nfoot of the hills 4 m. W. of the city are the beautiful gardens of Fin,\r\nthe scene of the official murder, on the 9th of January 1852, of Mirza\r\nTaki Khan, Amir Nizam, the grand vizier, one of the ablest ministers\r\nthat Persia has had in modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASHGAR, an important city of Chinese Turkestan, in 39 deg. 24' 26\" N.\r\nlat., 76 deg. 6' 47\" E. long., 4043 ft. above sea-level. It consists of\r\ntwo towns, Kuhna Shahr or \"old city,\" and Yangi Shahr or \"new city,\"\r\nabout five miles apart, and separated from one another by the Kyzyl Su,\r\na tributary of the Tarim river. It is called Su-leh by the Chinese,\r\nwhich perhaps represents an original Solek or Sorak. This name seems to\r\nbe older than Kashgar, which is said to mean \"variegated houses.\"\r\nSituated at the junction of routes from the valley of the Oxus, from\r\nKhokand and Samarkand, Almati, Aksu, and Khotan, the last two leading\r\nfrom China and India, Kashgar has been noted from very early times as a\r\npolitical and commercial centre. Like all other cities of Central Asia,\r\nit has changed hands repeatedly, and was from 1864-1887 the seat of\r\ngovernment of the Amir Yakub Beg, surnamed the Atalik Ghazi, who\r\nestablished and for a brief period ruled with remarkable success a\r\nMahommedan state comprising the chief cities of the Tarim basin from\r\nTurfan round along the skirt of the mountains to Khotan. But the kingdom\r\ncollapsed with his death and the Chinese retook the country in 1877 and\r\nhave held it since.\r\n\r\nKuhna Shahr is a small fortified city on high ground overlooking the\r\nriver Tuman. Its walls are lofty and supported by buttress bastions with\r\nloopholed turrets at intervals; the fortifications, however, are but of\r\nhard clay and are much out of repair. The city contains about 2500\r\nhouses. Beyond the bridge, a little way off, are the ruins of ancient\r\nKashgar, which once covered a large extent of country on both sides of\r\nthe Tuman, and the walls of which even now are 12 feet wide at the top\r\nand twice that in height. This city--Aski Shahr (Old Town) as it is now\r\ncalled--was destroyed in 1514 by Mirza Ababakar (Abubekr) on the\r\napproach of Sultan Said Khan's army. About two miles to the north beyond\r\nthe river is the shrine of Hazrat Afak, the saint king of the country,\r\nwho died and was buried here in 1693. It is a handsome mausoleum faced\r\nwith blue and white glazed tiles, standing under the shade of some\r\nmagnificent silver poplars. About it Yakub Beg erected a commodious\r\ncollege, mosque and monastery, the whole being surrounded by rich\r\norchards, fruit gardens and vineyards. The Yangi Shahr of Kashgar is, as\r\nits name implies, modern, having been built in 1838. It is of oblong\r\nshape running north and south, and is entered by a single gateway. The\r\nwalls are lofty and massive and topped by turrets, while on each side is\r\na projecting bastion. The whole is surrounded by a deep and wide ditch,\r\nwhich can be filled from the river, at the risk, however, of bringing\r\ndown the whole structure, for the walls are of mud, and stand upon a\r\nporous sandy soil. In the time of the Chinese, before Yakub Beg's sway,\r\nYangi Shahr held a garrison of six thousand men, and was the residence\r\nof the _amban_ or governor. Yakub erected his _orda_ or palace on the\r\nsite of the amban's residence, and two hundred ladies of his harem\r\noccupied a commodious enclosure hard by. The population of Kashgar has\r\nbeen recently estimated at 60,000 in the Kuhna Shahr and only 2000 in\r\nthe Yangi Shahr.\r\n\r\nWith the overthrow of the Chinese rule in 1865 the manufacturing\r\nindustries of Kashgar declined. Silk culture and carpet manufacture have\r\nflourished for ages at Khotan, and the products always find a ready sale\r\nat Kashgar. Other manufactures consist of a strong coarse cotton cloth\r\ncalled _kham_ (which forms the dress of the common people, and for\r\nwinter wear is padded with cotton and quilted), boots and shoes,\r\nsaddlery, felts, furs and sheepskins made up into cloaks, and various\r\narticles of domestic use. A curious street sight in Kashgar is presented\r\nby the hawkers of meat pies, pastry and sweetmeats, which they trundle\r\nabout on hand-barrows just as their counterparts do in Europe; while the\r\nknife-grinder's cart, and the vegetable seller with his tray or basket\r\non his head, recall exactly similar itinerant traders further west.\r\n\r\n  The earliest authentic mention of Kashgar is during the second period\r\n  of ascendancy of the Han dynasty, when the Chinese conquered the\r\n  Hiungnu, Yutien (Khotan), Sulei (Kashgar), and a group of states in\r\n  the Tarim basin almost up to the foot of the Tian Shan mountains. This\r\n  happened in 76 B.C. Kashgar does not appear to have been known in the\r\n  West at this time but Ptolemy speaks of Scythia beyond the Imaus,\r\n  which is in a _Kasia Regio_, possibly exhibiting the name whence\r\n  Kashgar and Kashgaria (often applied to the district) are formed. Next\r\n  ensues a long epoch of obscurity. The country was converted to\r\n  Buddhism and probably ruled by Indo-Scythian or Kushan kings. Hsuan\r\n  Tswang passed through Kashgar (which he calls Ka-sha) on his return\r\n  journey from India to China. The Buddhist religion, then beginning to\r\n  decay in India, was working its way to a new growth in China, and\r\n  contemporaneously the Nestorian Christians were establishing\r\n  bishoprics at Herat, Merv and Samarkand, whence they subsequently\r\n  proceeded to Kashgar, and finally to China itself. In the 8th century\r\n  came the Arab invasion from the west, and we find Kashgar and\r\n  Turkestan lending assistance to the reigning queen of Bokhara, to\r\n  enable her to repel the enemy. But although the Mahommedan religion\r\n  from the very commencement sustained checks, it nevertheless made its\r\n  weight felt upon the independent states of Turkestan to the north and\r\n  east, and thus acquired a steadily growing influence. It was not,\r\n  however, till the 10th century that Islam was established at Kashgar,\r\n  under the Uighur kingdom (see TURKS). The Uighurs appear to have been\r\n  the descendants of the people called Tolas and to have been one of the\r\n  many Turkish tribes who migrated westwards from China. Boghra Khan,\r\n  the most celebrated prince of this line, was converted to\r\n  Mahommedanism late in the 10th century and the Uighur kingdom lasted\r\n  until 1120 but was distracted by complicated dynastic struggles. The\r\n  Uighurs employed an alphabet based upon the Syriac and borrowed from\r\n  the Nestorian missionaries. They spoke a dialect of Turkish preserved\r\n  in the Kudatku Bilik, a moral treatise composed in 1065. Their kingdom\r\n  was destroyed by an invasion of the Kara-Kitais, another Turkish tribe\r\n  pressing westwards from the Chinese frontier, who in their turn were\r\n  swept away in 1219 by Jenghiz Khan. His invasion gave a decided check\r\n  to the progress of the Mahommedan creed, but on his death, and during\r\n  the rule of the Jagatai Khans, who became converts to that faith, it\r\n  began to reassert its ascendancy. Marco Polo visited the city, which\r\n  he calls Cascar, about 1275 and left some notes on it.\r\n\r\n  In 1389-1390 Timur ravaged Kashgar, Andijan and the intervening\r\n  country. Kashgar passed through a troublous time, and in 1514, on the\r\n  invasion of the Khan Sultan Said, was destroyed by Mirza Ababakar, who\r\n  with the aid of ten thousand men built the new fort with massive\r\n  defences higher up on the banks of the Tuman. The dynasty of the\r\n  Jagatai Khans collapsed in 1572 by the dismemberment of the country\r\n  between rival representatives; and soon after two powerful Khoja\r\n  factions, the White and Black Mountaineers (_Ak_ and _Kara Taghluk_),\r\n  arose, whose dissensions and warfares, with the intervention of the\r\n  Kalmucks of Dzungaria, fill up the history till 1759, when a Chinese\r\n  army from Ili (Kulja) invaded the country, and, after perpetrating\r\n  wholesale massacres, finally consolidated their authority by settling\r\n  therein Chinese emigrants, together with a Manchu garrison. The\r\n  Chinese had thoughts of pushing their conquests towards western\r\n  Turkestan and Samarkand, the chiefs of which sent to ask assistance of\r\n  the Afghan king Ahmed Shah. This monarch despatched an embassy to\r\n  Peking to demand the restitution of the Mahommedan states of Central\r\n  Asia, but the embassy was not well received, and Ahmed Shah was too\r\n  much engaged with the Sikhs to attempt to enforce his demands by arms.\r\n  The Chinese continued to hold Kashgar, with sundry interruptions from\r\n  Mahommedan revolts--one of the most serious occurring in 1827, when\r\n  the territory was invaded and the city taken by Jahanghir Khoja;\r\n  Chang-lung, however, the Chinese general of Ili, recovered possession\r\n  of Kashgar and the other revolted cities in 1828. A revolt in 1829\r\n  under Mahommed Ali Khan and Yusuf, brother of Jahanghir, was more\r\n  successful, and resulted in the concession of several important trade\r\n  privileges to the Mahommedans of the district of Alty Shahr (the \"six\r\n  cities\"), as it was then named. Until 1846 the country enjoyed peace\r\n  under the just and liberal rule of Zahir-ud-din, the Chinese governor,\r\n  but in that year a fresh Khoja revolt under Kath Tora led to his\r\n  making himself master of the city, with circumstances of unbridled\r\n  licence and oppression. His reign was, however, brief, for at the end\r\n  of seventy-five days, on the approach of the Chinese, he fled back to\r\n  Khokand amid the jeers of the inhabitants. The last of the Khoja\r\n  revolts (1857) was of about equal duration with the previous one, and\r\n  took place under Wali-Khan, a degraded debauchee, and the murderer of\r\n  the lamented traveller Adolf Schlagintweit.\r\n\r\n  The great Tungani (Dungani) revolt, or insurrection of the Chinese\r\n  Mahommedans, which broke out in 1862 in Kan-suh, spread rapidly to\r\n  Dzungaria and through the line of towns in the Tarim basin. The\r\n  Tungani troops in Yarkand rose, and (10th of August 1863) massacred\r\n  some seven thousand Chinese, while the inhabitants of Kashgar, rising\r\n  in their turn against their masters, invoked the aid of Sadik Beg, a\r\n  Kirghiz chief, who was reinforced by Buzurg Khan, the heir of\r\n  Jahanghir, and Yakub Beg, his general, these being despatched at\r\n  Sadik's request by the ruler of Khokand to raise what troops they\r\n  could to aid his Mahommedan friends in Kashgar. Sadik Beg soon\r\n  repented of having asked for a Khoja, and eventually marched against\r\n  Kashgar, which by this time had succumbed to Buzurg Khan and Yakub\r\n  Beg, but was defeated and driven back to Khokand. Buzurg Khan\r\n  delivered himself up to indolence and debauchery, but Yakub Beg, with\r\n  singular energy and perseverance, made himself master of Yangi Shahr,\r\n  Yangi-Hissar, Yarkand and other towns, and eventually became sole\r\n  master of the country, Buzurg Khan proving himself totally unfitted\r\n  for the post of ruler. Kashgar and the other cities of the Tarim basin\r\n  remained under Yakub Beg's rule until 1877, when the Chinese regained\r\n  possession of their ancient dominion.     (C. E. D. B.; C. El.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASHI, or KASI, formerly the Persian word for all glazed and enamelled\r\npottery irrespectively; now the accepted term for certain kinds of\r\nenamelled tile-work, including brick-work and tile-mosaic work,\r\nmanufactured in Persia and parts of Mahommedan India, chiefly during the\r\n16th and 17th centuries.[1]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly originating in the Semitic word for glass, _kas_, it is\r\nquite possible that the name _kashi_ is immediately derived from Kashan,\r\na town in Persia noted for its _faience_. This ancient pottery site, in\r\nturn, probably receives its name from the old-time industry; as a \"city\r\nof the plain\" it would obviously have no claim to the farther-eastern\r\nsuffix _shan_, meaning a mountain. Sir George Birdwood wisely considers\r\nthat \"the art of glazing earthenware has, in Persia, descended in an\r\nalmost unbroken tradition from the period of the greatness of Chaldaea\r\nand Assyria ... the name _kas_, by which it is known in Arabic and\r\nHebrew, carries us back to the manufacture of glass and enamels for\r\nwhich great Sidon was already famous 1500 years before Christ ... the\r\ndesigns used in the decoration of Sind and Punjab glazed pottery also go\r\nto prove how much these Indian wares have been influenced by Persian\r\nexamples and the Persian tradition of the much earlier art of Nineveh\r\nand Babylon\" (_The Industrial Arts of India_, 1880). The two native\r\nnames for glass, _kanch_ and _shisha_, common to Persia and India, are,\r\nseemingly, modifications of kashi. The Indian tradition of Chinese\r\npotters settling in bygone days at Lahore and Hala respectively, still\r\nlingers in the Punjab and Sind provinces, and evidently travelled\r\neastward from Persia with the Moguls. Howbeit in Lahore the name Chini\r\nis sometimes wrongly applied to _kashi_ work; and the so-called\r\nChini-ka-Rauza mausoleum at Agra is an instance of this misuse. It now\r\nseems an established fact that a colony of Chinese ceramic experts\r\nmigrated to Isfahan during the 16th century (probably in the reign, and\r\nat the invitation, of Shah Abbas I.), and there helped to revive the\r\njaded pottery industry of that district.\r\n\r\n  _Kashi_ work consisted of two kinds: (a) Enamel-faced tiles and\r\n  bricks of strongly fired red earthenware, or terra-cotta; (b)\r\n  Enamel-faced tiles and tesserae of lightly fired \"lime-mortar,\" or\r\n  sandstone. Tile-mosaic work is described by some authorities as the\r\n  true _kashi_. From examination of figured tile-mosaic patterns, it\r\n  would appear that, in some instances, the shaped tesserae had been cut\r\n  out of enamelled slabs or tiles after firing; in other examples to\r\n  have been cut into shape before receiving their facing of coloured\r\n  enamel. Mosaic panels in the fort at Lahore are described by J. L.\r\n  Kipling as \"showing a _gul dasta_, or foliated pattern of a branching\r\n  tree, each leaf of which is a separate piece of pottery.\" Conventional\r\n  representations of foliage, flowers and fruit, intricate geometrical\r\n  figures, interlacing arabesques, and decorative\r\n  calligraphy--inscriptions in Arabic and Persian--constitute the\r\n  ordinary _kashi_ designs. The colours chiefly used were cobalt blue,\r\n  copper blue (turquoise colour), lead-antimoniate yellow (mustard\r\n  colour), manganese purple, iron brown and tin white. A colour-scheme,\r\n  popular with Mogul and contemporary Persian _kashigars_, was the\r\n  design, in cobalt blue and copper blue, reserved on a ground of deep\r\n  mustard yellow. Before applying the enamel colours, the rough face of\r\n  the tile, or the tesserae, received a thin coating of slip of variable\r\n  composition. It is probably owing to some defect in this part of the\r\n  process, or to imperfect firing, that the enamelled tile surfaces on\r\n  many old buildings, particularly on the south side, have weathered and\r\n  flaked away.\r\n\r\n  In India the finest examples of _kashi_ work are in the Punjab and\r\n  Sind provinces. At Lahore, amongst many beautiful structures, the most\r\n  notable are the mosque of Wazir Khan (A.D. 1634) and the gateways of\r\n  three famous pleasure gardens, the Shalamar Bagh (A.D. 1637), the\r\n  Gulabi Bagh (A.D. 1640), and the Charburji (c. A.D. 1665). At Tatta\r\n  the Jami Masjid, built by Shah Jahan (c. A.D. 1645), is a splendid\r\n  illustration; whilst in that \"vast cemetery of six square miles\" on\r\n  the adjacent Malki plateau, are numerous Mahommedan tombs (A.D.\r\n  1570-1640) with extraordinary _kashi_ ornamentation. Delhi, Multan,\r\n  Jullundur, Shahdara, Lahore cantonment, Agra and Hyderabad (Sind), all\r\n  possess excellent monuments of the best period viz. those erected\r\n  during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir (A.D. 1556-1628).\r\n\r\n  In Persia, at Isfahan, Kashan, Meshed and Kerman are a few buildings\r\n  and ruins showing the old _kashi_ work; the palace of Chehel Situn in\r\n  Isfahan, built during the reign of Shah Abbas I. (c. A.D. 1600), is a\r\n  magnificent specimen of this art.\r\n\r\n  Occasional revivals of the manufacture have taken place both in India\r\n  and Persia. Mahommed Sharif, a potter of Jullundur in the Punjab,\r\n  reproduced the Mogul enamelled tile-work in 1885, and there is a\r\n  manuscript record of a certain Ustad Ali Mahommed, of Isfahan, who\r\n  revived the Persian processes in 1887.

It has been fabled\r\nin song for its beauty (e.g. in Moore's _Lalla Rookh_), and is the chief\r\nhealth resort for Europeans in India, while politically it is important\r\nas guarding one of the approaches to India on the north-west frontier.\r\nThe proper name of the state is Jammu and Kashmir, and it comprises in\r\nall an estimated area of 80,900 sq. m., with a population (1901) of\r\n2,905,578, showing an increase of 14.21% in the decade. It is bounded on\r\nthe north by some petty hills chiefships and by the Karakoram mountains;\r\non the east by Tibet; and on the south and west by the Punjab and\r\nNorth-West Frontier provinces. The state is in direct political\r\nsubordination to the Government of India, which is represented by a\r\nresident. Its territories comprise the provinces of Jammu (including the\r\njagir of Punch), Kashmir, Ladakh, Baltistan and Gilgit; the Shin states\r\nof Yaghistan, of which the most important are Chilas, Darel and Tangir,\r\nare nominally subordinate to it, and the two former pay a tribute of\r\ngold dust. The following are the statistics for the main divisions of\r\nthe state:--\r\n\r\n                     Area in sq. m.    Pop. in 1901.\r\n\r\n  Jammu                  5,223           1,521,307\r\n  Kashmir                7,922           1,157,394\r\n  Frontier Districts       443             226,877\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the state consists of uninhabited mountains, and its\r\nonly really important possessions are the districts of Jammu and\r\nKashmir.\r\n\r\n_Physical Conformation._--The greater portion of the country is\r\nmountainous, and with the exception of a strip of plain on the\r\nsouth-west, which is continuous with the great level of the Punjab, may\r\nbe conveniently divided into the following regions:\r\n\r\n  (1) The outer hills and the central mountains of Jammu district.\r\n  (2) The valley of Kashmir.\r\n  (3) The far side of the great central range, including Ladakh,\r\n      Baltistan and Gilgit.\r\n\r\nThe hills in the outer region of Jammu, adjoining the Punjab plains,\r\nbegin with a height of 100 to 200 ft., followed by a tract of rugged\r\ncountry, including various ridges running nearly parallel, with long\r\nnarrow valleys between. The average height of these ridges is from 3000\r\nto 4000 ft. The central mountains are commonly 8000 to 10,000 ft.,\r\ncovered with pasture or else with forest. Then follow the more lofty\r\nmountain ranges, including the region of perpetual snow. A great chain\r\nof snowy mountains branching off south-east and north-west divides the\r\ndrainage of the Chenab and the Jhelum rivers from that of the higher\r\nbranches of the Indus. It is within spurs from this chain that the\r\nvalley of Kashmir is enclosed amid hills which rise from 14,000 to\r\n15,000 ft., while the valley itself forms a cup-like basin at an\r\nelevation of 5000 to 6000 ft. All beyond that great range is a wide\r\ntract of mountainous country, bordering the north-western part of Tibet\r\nand embracing Ladakh, Baltistan and Gilgit.\r\n\r\n  The length of the Kashmir valley, including the inner slopes of its\r\n  surrounding hills, is about 120 m. from north-west to south-east with\r\n  a maximum width of about 75 m. The low and comparatively level floor\r\n  of the basin is 84 m. long and 20 to 24 m. broad.\r\n\r\n  The hills forming the northern half-circuit of the Kashmir valley, and\r\n  running beyond, include many lofty mountain masses and peaks, the most\r\n  conspicuous of which, a little outside the confines of Kashmir, is\r\n  Nanga Parbat, the fourth highest mountain in the world, 26,656 ft.\r\n  above the sea, with an extensive area of glacier on its eastern face.\r\n  The great ridge which is thrown off to the south-west by Nanga Parbat\r\n  rises, at a distance of 12 m., to another summit 20,740 ft. in height,\r\n  from which run south-west, and south-east the ridges which are the\r\n  northern watershed boundary of Kashmir. The former range, after\r\n  running 70 m. south-west, between the valleys of the Kishenganga and\r\n  the Kunhar or Nain-sukh, turns southward, closely pressing the river\r\n  Jhelum, after it has received the Kishenganga, with a break a few\r\n  miles farther south which admits the Kunhar. This range presents\r\n  several prominent summits, the highest two 16,487 and 15,544 ft. above\r\n  the sea. The range which runs south-east from the junction peak above\r\n  mentioned divides the valley of the Kishenganga from that of the Astor\r\n  and other tributaries of the Indus. The highest point on this range,\r\n  where it skirts Kashmir, is 17,202 ft. above the sea. For more than 50\r\n  m. from Nanga Parbat there are no glaciers on this range; thence\r\n  eastward they increase; one, near the Zoji-la pass, is only 10,850 ft.\r\n  above the sea. The mountains at the east end of the valley, running\r\n  nearly north and south, drain inwards to the Jhelum, and on the other\r\n  side to the Wardwan, a tributary of the Chenab. The highest part of\r\n  this eastern boundary is 14,700 ft. There no are glaciers. The highest\r\n  point on the Panjal range, which forms the south and south-west\r\n  boundary, is 15,523 ft. above the sea.\r\n\r\n  The river Jhelum (q.v.) or Behat (Sanskrit (_Vitasta_)--the Hydaspes\r\n  of Greek historians and geographers--flows north-westward through the\r\n  middle of the valley. After a slow and winding course it expands about\r\n  25 m. below Srinagar, over a slight depression in the plain, and forms\r\n  the Wular lake and marsh, which is about 12(1/2) m. by 5 m. in extent,\r\n  and surrounded by the lofty mountains which tower over the north and\r\n  north-east of the valley. Leaving the lake on the south-west side,\r\n  near the town of Sopur, the river pursues its sluggish course\r\n  south-westward, about 18 m. to the gorge at Baramulla. From this point\r\n  the stream is more rapid through the narrow valley which conducts it\r\n  westward 75 m. to Muzaffarabad, where it turns sharply south, joined\r\n  by the Kishenganga. At Islamabad, about 40 m. above Srinagar, the\r\n  river is 5400 ft. above sea-level, and at Srinagar 5235 ft. It has\r\n  thus a fall of about 4 ft. per mile in this part of its course. For\r\n  the next 24 m. to the Wular lake, and thence to Baramulla, its fall is\r\n  only about 2(1/4) ft. in the mile. On the 80 m. of the river in the\r\n  flat valley between Islamabad and Baramulla, there is much boat\r\n  traffic; but none below Baramulla, till the river comes out into the\r\n  plains.\r\n\r\n  On the north-east side of this low narrow plain of the Jhelum is a\r\n  broad hilly tract between which and the higher boundary range runs the\r\n  Kishenganga River. Near the east end of this interior hilly tract, and\r\n  connected with the higher range, is one summit 17,839 ft. Around this\r\n  peak and between the ridges which run from it are many small glaciers.\r\n  These heights look down on one side into the beautiful valley of the\r\n  Sind River, and on another into the valley of the Lidar, which join\r\n  the Jhelum. Among the hills north of Srinagar rises one conspicuous\r\n  mountain mass, 16,903 ft. in height, from which on its north side\r\n  descend tributaries of the Kishenganga, and on the south the Wangat\r\n  River, which flows into the Sind. By these rivers and their numerous\r\n  affluents the whole valley of Kashmir is watered abundantly.\r\n\r\n  Around the foot of many spurs of the hills which run down on the\r\n  Kashmir plain are pieces of low table-land, called karewa. These\r\n  terraces vary in height at different parts of the valley from 100 to\r\n  300 ft. above the alluvial plain. Those which are near each other are\r\n  mostly about the same level, and separated by deep ravines. The level\r\n  plain in the middle of the Kashmir valley consists of fine clay and\r\n  sand, with water-worn pebbles. The karewas consist of horizontal beds\r\n  of clay and sand, the lacustrine nature of which is shown by the\r\n  shells which they contain.\r\n\r\n  Two passes lead northward from the Kashmir valley, the Burzil (13,500\r\n  ft.) and the Kamri (14,050). The Burzil is the main pass between\r\n  Srinagar and Gilgit via Astor. It is usually practicable only between\r\n  the middle of July and the middle of September. The road from Srinagar\r\n  to Lehin Ladakh follows the Sind valley to the Zoji-la-pass (11,300\r\n  ft.) Only a short piece of the road, where snow accumulates, prevents\r\n  this pass being used all the year. At the south-east end of the valley\r\n  are three passes, the Margan (11,500 ft.), the Hoksar (13,315) and the\r\n  Marbal (11,500), leading to the valleys of the Chenab and the Ravi.\r\n  South of Islamabad, on the direct route to Jammu and Sialkot, is the\r\n  Banihal pass (9236 ft.). Further west on the Panjal range is the Pir\r\n  Panjal or Panchal pass (11,400 ft.), with a second pass, the Rattan\r\n  Pir (8200 ft.), across a second ridge about 15 m. south-west of it.\r\n  Between the two passes is the beautifully situated fort of Baramgali.\r\n  This place is in the domain of the raja of Punch, cousin and tributary\r\n  of the maharaja of Kashmir. At Rajaori, south of these passes, the\r\n  road divides: one line leads to Bhimber and Gujrat, the other to Jammu\r\n  and Sialkot by Aknur. South-west of Baramulla is the Haji Pir pass\r\n  (8500 ft.), which indicates the road to Punch. From Punch one road\r\n  leads down to the plains at the town of Jhelum, another eastward\r\n  through the hills to the Rattan Pir pass and Rajaori. Lastly, there is\r\n  the river pass of the Jhelum, which is the easy route from the valley\r\n  westward, having two ways down to the plains, one by Muzaffarabad and\r\n  the Hazara valley to Hasan Abdal, the other by the British hill\r\n  station of Murree to Rawalpindi.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--The general strike of the beds, and of the folds which\r\n  have affected them, is from N.W. to S.E., parallel to the mountain\r\n  ranges. Along the south-western border lies the zone of Tertiary beds\r\n  which forms the Sub-Himalayas. Next to this is a great belt of\r\n  Palaeozoic rocks, through which rise the granite, gneiss and schist of\r\n  the Zanskar and Dhauladhar ranges and of the Pir Panjal. In the midst\r\n  of the Palaeozoic area lie the alluvium and Pleistocene deposits of\r\n  the Srinagar valley, and the Mesozoic and Carboniferous basin of the\r\n  upper part of the Sind valley. Beyond the great Palaeozoic belt is a\r\n  zone of Mesozoic and Tertiary beds which commences at Kargil and\r\n  extends south-eastward past the Kashmir boundary to Spiti and beyond.\r\n  Finally, in Baltistan and the Ladakh range there is a broad zone\r\n  composed chiefly of gneiss and schist of ancient date.\r\n\r\n  The oldest fossils found belong either to the Ordovician or Silurian\r\n  systems. But it is not until the Carboniferous is reached that fossils\r\n  become at all abundant (so far as is yet known). The Mesozoic deposits\r\n  belong chiefly to the Trias and Jura, but Cretaceous beds have been\r\n  found near the head of the Tsarap valley. The Tertiary system includes\r\n  representatives of all the principal divisions recognized in other\r\n  parts of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--The valley of Kashmir, sheltered from the south-west\r\n  monsoon by the Panjal range, has not the periodical rains of India.\r\n  Its rainfall is irregular, greatest in the spring months. Occasional\r\n  storms in the monsoon pass over the crests of the Panjal and give\r\n  heavy rain on the elevated plateaus on the Kashmir side. And again\r\n  clouds pass over the valley and are arrested by the higher hills on\r\n  the north-east side. Snow falls on the surrounding hills at intervals\r\n  from October to March. In the valley the first snow generally falls\r\n  about the end of December, but never to any great amount. The hottest\r\n  months are July, August and the greater part of September, during\r\n  which the noon shade temperature varies from 85 deg. to 90 deg. and\r\n  occasionally 95 deg. at Srinagar, probably the hottest place in the\r\n  valley. The coldest months are January and February, when for several\r\n  weeks the average minimum temperature is about 15 deg. below freezing.\r\n  As a health resort the province, excluding Srinagar, which is\r\n  insanitary and relaxing, has no rival anywhere in the neighbourhood of\r\n  India. Its climate is admirably adapted to the European constitution,\r\n  and in consequence of the varied range of temperature and the facility\r\n  of moving about the visitor is enabled with ease to select places at\r\n  elevations most congenial to him. Formerly only 200 passes a year were\r\n  issued by the government, but now no restriction is placed on\r\n  visitors, and their number increases annually. European sportsmen and\r\n  travellers, in addition to residents of India, resort there freely.\r\n  The railway to Rawalpindi, and a driving road thence to Srinagar make\r\n  the valley easy of access. When the temperature in Srinagar rises at\r\n  the beginning of June, there is a general exodus to Gulmarg, which has\r\n  become a fashionable hill-station. This great influx of visitors has\r\n  resulted in a corresponding diminution of game. Special game\r\n  preservation rules have been introduced, and _nullahs_ are let out for\r\n  stated periods with a restriction on the number of head to be shot.\r\n  The wild animals of the country include ibex, markhor, oorial, the\r\n  Kashmir stag, and black and brown bears. Many sportsmen now cross into\r\n  Ladakh and the Pamirs.\r\n\r\n_People._--The great majority of the inhabitants of Kashmir are\r\nprofessedly Mahommedans, but their conversion to the faith of Islam is\r\ncomparatively recent and they are still strongly influenced by their\r\nancient superstitions. At the census of 1901 out of a total population\r\nin the whole state of 2,905,578, there were 2,154,695 Mahommedans,\r\n689,073 Hindus, 35,047 Buddhists and 25,828 Sikhs. The Hindus are mostly\r\nfound in Jammu, and the Buddhists are confined to Ladakh. In Kashmir\r\nproper the few Hindus (60,682) are almost all Brahmans, known as\r\nPundits. Superstition has made the Kashmiri timid; tyranny has made him\r\na liar; while physical disasters have made him selfish and pessimistic.\r\nUp to recent times the cultivator lived under a system of _begar_, which\r\nentitled an official to take either labour or commodities free of\r\npayment from the villages. Having no security of property, the people\r\nhad no incentive to effort, and with no security for life they lost the\r\nindependence of free men. But the land settlement of 1889 swept all\r\nthese abuses away. Restrictive monopolies, under which bricks, lime,\r\npaper and certain other manufactures were closed to private enterprise,\r\nwere abolished. The results of the settlement are thus enumerated by Sir\r\nWalter Lawrence: \"Little by little, confidence has sprung up. Land which\r\nhad no value in 1889 is now eagerly sought after by all classes.\r\nCultivation has extended and improved. Houses have been rebuilt and\r\nrepaired, fields fenced in, orchards planted, vegetable gardens well\r\nstocked and new mills constructed. Women no longer are seen toiling in\r\nthe fields, for their husbands are now at home to do the work, and the\r\nlong journeys to Gilgit are a thing of the past. When the harvest is\r\nripe the peasant reaps it at his own good time, and not a soldier ever\r\nenters the villages.\" In consequence of this improvement in their\r\nconditions of life and of the influx of wealth into the country brought\r\nby visitors, the Kashmiri grows every year in material prosperity and\r\nindependence of character. The Kashmir women have a reputation for\r\nbeauty which is not altogether deserved, but the children are always\r\npretty.\r\n\r\nThe language spoken in Kashmir is akin to that of the Punjab, though\r\nmarked by many peculiarities. It possesses an ancient literature, which\r\nis written in a special character (see KASHMIRI).\r\n\r\n  _Natural Calamities._--The effect of physical calamities partly\r\n  incidental to the climate of Kashmir, upon the character of its\r\n  inhabitants has been referred to. The list includes fires, floods,\r\n  earthquakes, famines and cholera. The ravages of fire are chiefly felt\r\n  in Srinagar, where the wood houses and their thatched roofs fall an\r\n  easy prey to the flames. The national habit of carrying a _kangar_, or\r\n  small brazier, underneath the clothes for the purpose of warming the\r\n  body, is a fruitful cause of fires. Srinagar is said to have been\r\n  burnt down eighteen times. Many disastrous floods are recorded, the\r\n  greatest being the terrible inundation which followed the slipping of\r\n  the Khadanyar mountain below Baramula in A.D. 879. The channel of the\r\n  Jhelum river was blocked and a large part of the valley submerged. In\r\n  1841 a serious flood caused great damage to life and property; there\r\n  was another in 1893, when six out of the seven bridges in Srinagar\r\n  were washed away, 25,426 acres under crops were submerged and 2225\r\n  houses were wrecked; another flood occurred in July 1903, when the\r\n  bund between the Dal Lake and the canal gave way, and the lake rose 10\r\n  ft. in half an hour. Between two and three thousand houses in and\r\n  around Srinagar collapsed, while over 40 miles of the tonga road were\r\n  submerged. Since the 15th century eleven great earthquakes have\r\n  occurred, all of long duration and accompanied by great loss of life.\r\n  During the 19th century there were four severe earthquakes, the last\r\n  two occurring in 1864 and 1885, when some 3500 people were killed.\r\n  Native historians record nineteen great famines, the last two\r\n  occurring in 1831 and 1877. In 1878 it was reported that only\r\n  two-fifths of the total population of the valley survived. During the\r\n  19th century also there were ten epidemics of cholera, all more or\r\n  less disastrous, while the worst (in 1892) was probably the last.\r\n  During that year 5781 persons died in Srinagar and 5931 in the\r\n  villages. The centre of infection is generally supposed to be the\r\n  squalid capital of Srinagar, and some efforts to improve its\r\n  sanitation have been made of recent years.\r\n\r\n  _Crops._--The staple crop of the valley is rice, which forms the chief\r\n  food of the people. Indian corn comes next; wheat, barley and oats are\r\n  also grown. Every kind of English vegetable thrives well, especially\r\n  asparagus, artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarlet-runners, beetroot,\r\n  cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are met with all over the valley,\r\n  wild but bearing fruit, and the cultivated orchards yield pears,\r\n  apples, peaches, cherries, &c., equal to the best European produce.\r\n  The chief trees are deodar, firs and pines, chenar or plane, maple,\r\n  birch and walnut. There are state departments of viticulture, hops,\r\n  horticulture and sericulture. A complete list of the flora and fauna\r\n  of the valley will be found in Sir Walter Lawrence's book on Kashmir.\r\n\r\n  _Industries._--The chief industry of Srinagar was formerly the weaving\r\n  of the celebrated Kashmir shawl, which dates back to the days of the\r\n  emperor Baber. These shawls first became fashionable in Europe in the\r\n  reign of Napoleon, when they fetched from L10 to L100; but the\r\n  industry received a blow at the time of the Franco-German War, and the\r\n  famine of 1877 scattered the weavers. The place of the Kashmir shawl\r\n  has to some extent been taken by the Kashmir carpet, but the most\r\n  thriving industry now is that of silk-weaving. Srinagar is also\r\n  celebrated for its silver-work, papier mache and wood-carving. The\r\n  minerals and metals of the Jammu district are promising, and a company\r\n  has been formed to work them. Coal of fair quality has been found, but\r\n  the difficulties of transport interfere with its working.\r\n\r\n_History._--The metrical chronicle of the kings of Kashmir, called\r\n_Rajatarangini_, was pronounced by Professor H. H. Wilson to be the only\r\nSanskrit composition yet discovered to which the title of history can\r\nwith any propriety be applied. It first became known to the Mahommedans\r\nwhen, on Akbar's invasion of Kashmir in 1588, a copy was presented to\r\nthe emperor. A translation into Persian was made by his order, and a\r\nsummary of its contents, from this Persian translation, is given by\r\nAbu'l Fazl in the _A'in-i-Akbari_. The _Rajatarangini_, the first of a\r\nseries of four Sanskrit histories, was written about the middle of the\r\n12th century by P. Kalhana. His work, in six books, makes use of earlier\r\nwritings now lost. Commencing with traditional history of very early\r\ntimes, it comes down to the reign of Sangrama Deva, 1006; the second\r\nwork, by Jonaraja, takes up the history in continuation of Kalhana's,\r\nand, entering the Mahommedan period, gives an account of the reigns down\r\nto that of Zain-ul-ab-ad-din, 1412. P. Srivara carried on the record to\r\nthe accession of Fah Shah, 1486. And the fourth work, called\r\n_Rajavalipataka_, by Prajnia Bhatta, completes the history to the time\r\nof the incorporation of Kashmir in the dominions of the Mogul emperor\r\nAkbar, 1588.\r\n\r\nIn the _Rajatarangini_ it is stated that the valley of Kashmir was\r\nformerly a lake, and that it was drained by the great _rishi_ or sage,\r\nKasyapa, son of Marichi, son of Brahma, by cutting the gap in the hills\r\nat Baramulla (Varaha-mula). When Kashmir had been drained, he brought in\r\nthe Brahmans to occupy it. This is still the local tradition, and in the\r\nexisting physical condition of the country we may see some ground for\r\nthe story which has taken this form. The name of Kasyapa is by history\r\nand tradition connected with the draining of the lake, and the chief\r\ntown or collection of dwellings in the valley was called Kasyapa-pur--a\r\nname which has been plausibly identified with the [Greek: Kaspapyros] of\r\nHecataeus (Steph. Byz., _s.v._) and [Greek: Kaspatyros] of Herodotus\r\n(iii. 102, iv. 44). Kashmir is the country meant also by Ptolemy's\r\n[Greek: Kasperia]. The ancient name Kasyapa-pur was applied to the\r\nkingdom of Kashmir when it comprehended great part of the Punjab and\r\nextended beyond the Indus. In the 7th century Kashmir is said by the\r\nChinese traveller Hsuan Tsang to have included Kabul and the Punjab, and\r\nthe hill region of Gandhara, the country of the Gandarae of classical\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\nAt an early date the Sanskrit name of the country became _KasmIr_. The\r\nearliest inhabitants, according to the _Rajatarangini_, were the people\r\ncalled Naga, a word which signifies \"snake.\" The history shows the\r\nprevalence in early times of tree and serpent worship, of which some\r\nsculptured stones found in Kashmir still retain the memorials. The town\r\nof Islamabad is called also by its ancient name Anant-nag (\"eternal\r\nsnake\"). The source of the Jhelum is at Vir-nag (the powerful snake),\r\n&c. The other races mentioned as inhabiting this country and the\r\nneighbouring hills are Gandhari, Khasa and Daradae. The Khasa people are\r\nsupposed to have given the name Kasmir. In the _Mahabharata_ the Kasmira\r\nand Daradae are named together among the Kshattriya races of northern\r\nIndia. The question whether, in the immigration of the Aryans into\r\nIndia, Kashmir was taken on the way, or entered afterwards by that\r\npeople after they had reached the Punjab from the north-west, appears to\r\nrequire an answer in favour of the latter view (see vol. ii. of Dr J.\r\nMuir's _Sanskrit Texts_). The Aryan races of Kashmir and surrounding\r\nhills, which have at the present time separate geographical\r\ndistribution, are given by Mr Drew as _Kashmiri_ (mostly Mahommedan), in\r\nthe Kashmir basin and a few scattered places outside; _Dard_ (mostly\r\nMahommedan) in Gilgit and hills north of Kashmir; _Dogra_ (Hindu) in\r\nJamma; _Dogra_ (Mahommedan, called _Chibali_) in Punch and hill country\r\nwest of Kashmir; _Pahari_ or mountaineers (Hindu) in Kishtwar, east of\r\nKashmir, and hills about the valley of the Chenab.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Asoka, about 245 B.C., one of the Indian Buddhist\r\nmissions was sent to Kashmir and Gandhara. After his death Brahmanism\r\nrevived. Then in the time of the three Kushan princes, Huvishka, Jushka\r\nand Kanishka, who ruled over Kashmir about the beginning of the\r\nChristian era, Buddhism was to a great extent restored, though for\r\nseveral centuries the two religions existed together in Kashmir,\r\nHinduism predominating. Yet Kashmir, when Buddhism was gradually losing\r\nits hold, continued to send Buddhist teachers to other lands. In this\r\nHindu-Buddhist period, and chiefly between the 5th and 10th centuries of\r\nthe Christian era, were erected the Hindu temples in Kashmir. In the 6th\r\nand 7th centuries Kashmir was visited by some of the Chinese Buddhist\r\npilgrims to India. The country is called _Shie-mi_ in the narrative of\r\nTo Yeng and Sung Yun (578). One of the Chinese travellers of the next\r\ncentury was for a time an elephant-tamer to the king of Kashmir. Hsuan\r\nTsang spent two years (631-633) in Kashmir (_Kia-chi-mi-lo_). He entered\r\nby Baramula and left by the Pir Panjal pass. He describes the hill-girt\r\nvalley, and the abundance of flowers and fruits, and he mentions the\r\ntradition about the lake. He found in Kashmir many Buddhists as well as\r\nHindus. In the following century the kings of Kashmir appear to have\r\npaid homage and tribute to China, though this is not alluded to in the\r\nKashmir chronicle. Hindu kings continued to reign till about 1294, when\r\nUdiana Deva was put to death by his Mahommedan vizier, Amir Shah, who\r\nascended the throne under the name of Shams-ud-din.\r\n\r\nOf the Mahommedan rulers mentioned in the Sanskrit chronicles, one, who\r\nreigned about the close of the 14th century, has made his name prominent\r\nby his active opposition to the Hindu religion, and his destruction of\r\ntemples. This was Sikandar, known as _But-shikan_, or the\r\n\"idol-breaker.\" It was in his time that India was invaded by Timur, to\r\nwhom Sikandar made submission and paid tribute. The country fell into\r\nthe hands of the Moguls in 1588. In the time of Alamgir it passed to\r\nAhmad Shah Durani, on his third invasion of India (1756); and from that\r\ntime it remained in the hands of Afghans till it was wrested from them\r\nby Ranjit Singh, the Sikh monarch of the Punjab, in 1819. Eight Hindu\r\nand Sikh governors under Ranjit Singh and his successors were followed\r\nby two Mahommedans similarly appointed, the second of whom, Shekh\r\nImam-ud-din, was in charge when the battles of the first Sikh war 1846\r\nbrought about new relations between the British Government and the\r\nSikhs.\r\n\r\nGulab Singh, a Dogra Rajput, had from a humble position been raised to\r\nhigh office by Ranjit Singh, who conferred on him the small principality\r\nof Jammu. On the final defeat of the Sikhs at Sobraon (February 1846),\r\nGulab Singh was called to take a leading part in arranging conditions of\r\npeace. The treaty of Lahore (March 9, 1846) sets forth that, the British\r\nGovernment having demanded, in addition to a certain assignment of\r\nterritory, a payment of a crore and a half of rupees (1(1/2) millions\r\nsterling), and the Sikh government being unable to pay the whole, the\r\nmaharaja (Dhulip Singh) cedes, as equivalent for one crore, the hill\r\ncountry belonging to the Punjab between the Beas and the Indus,\r\nincluding Kashmir and Hazara. The governor-general, Sir Henry Hardinge,\r\nconsidered it expedient to make over Kashmir to the Jammu chief,\r\nsecuring his friendship while the British government was administering\r\nthe Punjab on behalf of the young maharaja. Gulab Singh was well\r\nprepared to make up the payment in default of which Kashmir was ceded to\r\nthe British; and so, in consideration of his services in restoring\r\npeace, his independent sovereignty of the country made over to him was\r\nrecognized, and he was admitted to a separate treaty. Gulab Singh had\r\nalready, after several extensions of territory east and west of Jammu,\r\nconquered Ladakh (a Buddhist country, and till then subject to Lhasa),\r\nand had then annexed Skardo, which was under independent Mahommedan\r\nrulers. He had thus by degrees half encircled Kashmir, and by this last\r\naddition his possessions attained nearly their present form and extent.\r\nGulab Singh died in 1857, and was succeeded by his son, Ranbir Singh,\r\nwho died in 1885. The next ruler, Maharaja Partab Singh, G.C.S.I. (b.\r\n1850), immediately on his accession inaugurated the settlement reforms\r\nalready described. His rule was remarkable for the reassertion of the\r\nKashmir sovereignty over Gilgit (q.v.). Kashmir imperial service troops\r\nparticipated in the Black Mountain expedition of 1891, the Hunza Nagar\r\noperations of 1891, and the Tirah campaign of 1897-1898. The total\r\nrevenue of the state is about L666,000.\r\n\r\n  See Drew, _Jammu and Kashmir_ (1875); M. A. Stein, _Kalhana's\r\n  Rajatarangini_ (1900); W. R. Lawrence, _The Valley of Kashmir_ (1895);\r\n  Colonel A. Durand, _The Making of a Frontier_ (1899); R. Lydekker,\r\n  \"The Geology of the Kashmir and Chamba Territories,\" _Records of the\r\n  Geological Survey of India_, vol. xxii. (1883); J. Duke, _Kashmir\r\n  Handbook_ (1903).     (T. H. H.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASHMIRI (properly _Kasmiri_), the name of the vernacular language\r\nspoken in the valley of Kashmir (properly _Kasmir_) and in the hills\r\nadjoining. In the Indian census of 1901 the number of speakers was\r\nreturned at 1,007,957. By origin it is the most southern member of the\r\nDard group of the Pisaca languages (see INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGES). The other\r\nmembers of the group are Shina, spoken to its north in the country round\r\nGilgit, and Kohistani, spoken in the hill country on both sides of the\r\nriver Indus before it debouches on to the plains of India. The Pisaca\r\nlanguages also include Khowar, the vernacular of Chitral, and the Kafir\r\ngroup of speeches, of which the most important is the Bashgali of\r\nKafiristan. Of all these forms of speech Kashmiri is the only one which\r\npossesses a literature, or indeed an alphabet. It is also the only one\r\nwhich has been dealt with in the census of India, and it is therefore\r\nimpossible to give even approximate figures for the numbers of speakers\r\nof the others. The whole family occupies the three-sided tract of\r\ncountry between the Hindu-Kush and the north-western frontier of British\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nAs explained in INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGES, the Pisaca languages are Aryan,\r\nbut are neither Iranian nor Indo-Aryan. They represent the speech of an\r\nindependent Aryan migration over the Hindu-Kush directly into their\r\npresent inhospitable seats, where they have developed a phonetic system\r\nof their own, while they have retained unchanged forms of extreme\r\nantiquity which have long passed out of current use both in Persia and\r\nin India. Their speakers appear to have left the main Aryan body after\r\nthe great fission which resulted in the Indo-Aryan migration, but before\r\nall the typical peculiarities of Iranian speech had fully developed.\r\nThey are thus representatives of a stage of linguistic progress later\r\nthan that of Sanskrit, and earlier than that which we find recorded in\r\nthe Iranian Avesta.\r\n\r\nThe immigrants into Kashmir must have been Shins, speaking a language\r\nclosely allied to the ancestor of the modern Shina. They appear to have\r\ndispossessed and absorbed an older non-Aryan people, whom local\r\ntradition now classes as Nagas, or Snake-gods, and, at an early period,\r\nto have come themselves under the influence of Indo-Aryan immigrants\r\nfrom the south, who entered the valley along the course of the river\r\nJhelam. The language has therefore lost most of its original Pisaca\r\ncharacter, and is now a mixed one. Sanskrit has been actively studied\r\nfor many centuries, and the Kashmiri vocabulary, and even its grammar,\r\nare now largely Indian. So much is this the case that, for convenience'\r\nsake, it is now frequently classed (see INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGES) as\r\nbelonging to the north-western group of languages, instead of as\r\nbelonging to the Pisaca family as its origin demands. It cannot be said\r\nthat either classification is wrong.\r\n\r\nKashmiri has few dialects. In the valley there are slight changes of\r\nidiom from place to place, but the only important variety is Kishtwari,\r\nspoken in the hills south-west of Kashmir. Smaller dialects, such as\r\nPogul and Rambani of the hills south of the Banihal pass, may also be\r\nmentioned. The language itself is an old one. Pure Kashmiri words are\r\npreserved in the Sanskrit _Rajatarangini_ written by Kalhana in the 12th\r\ncentury A.D., and, judging from these specimens, the language does not\r\nappear to have changed materially since his time.\r\n\r\n_General Character of the Language._--Kashmiri is a language of great\r\nphilological interest. The two principal features which at once strike\r\nthe student are the numerous epenthetic changes of vowels and consonants\r\nand the employment of pronominal suffixes. In both cases the phenomena\r\nare perfectly plain, cause and effect being alike presented to the eye\r\nin the somewhat complicated systems of declension and conjugation. The\r\nIndo-Aryan languages proper have long ago passed through this stage, and\r\nmany of the phenomena now presented by them are due to its influence,\r\nalthough all record of it has disappeared. In this way a study of\r\nKashmiri explains a number of difficulties found by the student of\r\nIndo-Aryan vernaculars.[1]\r\n\r\n  In the following account the reader is presumed to be in possession of\r\n  the facts recorded in the articles INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGES and PRAKRIT,\r\n  and the following contractions will be employed: Ksh. = Kashmiri; Skr.\r\n  = Sanskrit; P. = Pisaca; Sh. = Shina.\r\n\r\n  A. _Vocabulary._ The vocabulary of Kashmiri is, as has been explained,\r\n  mixed. At its basis it has a large number of words which are also\r\n  found in the neighbouring Shina, and these are such as connote the\r\n  most familiar ideas and such as are in most frequent use. Thus, the\r\n  personal pronouns, the earlier numerals, the words for \"father,\"\r\n  \"mother,\" \"fire,\" \"the sun,\" are all closely connected with\r\n  corresponding Shina words. There is also a large Indian element,\r\n  consisting partly of words derived from Sanskrit vocables introduced\r\n  in ancient times, and partly of words borrowed in later days from the\r\n  vernaculars of the Punjab. Finally, there is a considerable Persian\r\n  (including Arabic) element due to the long Mussulman domination of the\r\n  Happy Valley. Many of these have been considerably altered in\r\n  accordance with Kashmiri phonetic rules, so that they sometimes appear\r\n  in strange forms. Thus the Persian _lagam_, a bridle, has become\r\n  _lakam_, and the Arabic _babat_, concerning, appears as _bapat_. The\r\n  population speaking Kashmiri is mainly Mussulman, there being, roughly\r\n  speaking, nine Mahommedan Kashmiris to less than one Hindu. This\r\n  difference of religion has strongly influenced the vocabulary. The\r\n  Mussulmans use Persian and Arabic words with great freedom, while the\r\n  Hindus, or \"Pandits\" as they are called, confine their borrowings\r\n  almost entirely to words derived from Sanskrit. As the literary class\r\n  is mostly Hindu, it follows that Kashmiri literature, taken as a\r\n  whole, while affording most interesting and profitable study, hardly\r\n  represents the actual language spoken by the mass of the people. There\r\n  are, however, a few good Kashmiri works written by Mussulmans in their\r\n  own dialect.\r\n\r\n  B. _Written Characters._ Mussulmans and Christian missionaries employ\r\n  an adaptation of the Persian character for their writings. This\r\n  alphabet is quite unsuited for representing the very complex Kashmiri\r\n  vowel system. Hindus employ the Sarada alphabet, of Indian origin and\r\n  akin to the well-known Nagari. Kashmiri vowel sounds can be recorded\r\n  very successfully in this character, but there is, unfortunately, no\r\n  fixed system of spelling. The Nagari alphabet is also coming into use\r\n  in printed books, no Sarada types being yet in existence.\r\n\r\n  C. _Phonetics._ Comparing the Kashmiri with the Sanskrit alphabet (see\r\n  SANSKRIT), we must first note a considerable extension of the vowel\r\n  system. Not only does Ksh. possess the vowels _a_, _a_, _i_, _i_, _u_,\r\n  _u_, _r_, _e_, _ai_, _o_, _au_, and the _anunasika_ or nasal symbol ~,\r\n  but it has also a flat _a_ (like the _a_ in \"hat\") a flat _e_ (like\r\n  the _e_ in \"met\"), a short _o_ (like the _o_ in \"hot\") and a broad _a_\r\n  (like the _a_ in \"all\"). It also has a series of what natives call\r\n  \"_matra_-vowels,\" which are represented in the Roman character by\r\n  small letters above the line, viz. _^a_, _^i_, _^u_, _^u_. Of these,\r\n  _^a_ is simply a very short indeterminate sound something like that of\r\n  the Hebrew _sh^awa mobile_, except that it may sometimes be the only\r\n  vowel in a word, as in _ts^ah_, thou. The _^i_ is a hardly audible\r\n  _i_, while _^u_ and _^u_ are quite inaudible at the end of a syllable.\r\n  When ^i or ^u is followed by a consonant in the same syllable _^i_\r\n  generally and _^u_ always becomes a full _i_ or _u_ respectively and\r\n  is so pronounced. On the other hand, in similar circumstances, _^u_\r\n  remains unchanged in writing, but is pronounced like a short German\r\n  _u_. It should be observed that this _^u_ always represents an older\r\n  _i_, and is still considered to be a palatal, not, like _^u_, a labial\r\n  vowel. Although these matra-vowels are so slightly heard, they\r\n  exercise a great influence on the sound of a preceding syllable. We\r\n  may compare the sound of _a_ in the English word \"mar.\" If we add _e_\r\n  to the end of this word we get \"mare,\" in which the sound of the _a_\r\n  is altogether changed, although the _e_ is not itself pronounced in\r\n  its proper place. The back-action of these matra-vowels is technically\r\n  known as _umlaut_ or \"epenthesis,\" and is the most striking feature of\r\n  the Kashmiri language, the structure of which is unintelligible\r\n  without a thorough knowledge of the system. In the following pages\r\n  when a vowel is epenthetically affected by a matra-vowel the fact will\r\n  be denoted by a dot placed under it, thus _kar^u_. This is not the\r\n  native system, according to which the change is indicated sometimes by\r\n  a diacritical mark and sometimes by writing a different letter. The\r\n  changes of pronunciation effected by each matra-vowel are shown in the\r\n  following table. If natives employ a different letter to indicate the\r\n  change the fact is mentioned. In other cases they content themselves\r\n  with diacritical marks. When no entry is made, it should be understood\r\n  that the sound of the vowel remains unaltered:--\r\n\r\n    +------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |Pre-  |                 _Pronunciation when followed by_                   |\r\n    |ceding+----------------+----------------+-----------------+----------------+\r\n    |Vowel.|    _a-matra_   |    _i-matra_   |    _u-matra_    |   _u-matra_    |\r\n    +------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+----------------+\r\n    |  a.  | a (ad^ar,      | a^i (kar^i, pr.| u (as in German:| o (like first  |\r\n    |      | be moist) (some| ka^ir^i, made, | kar^u, pr. kur, | o in \"promote\";|\r\n    |      | thing like a   | plural masc.)  | made, fem.      | kar^u, pr. kor,|\r\n    |      | short German o)|                | sing.)          | made, masc.    |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | sing.)         |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 |                |\r\n    |  /a. | o (kan^ar,     | o^i (German o; | o (mar^u, pr.   | a (mar^u, pr.  |\r\n    |      | pr. kon^ar,    | mar^i, pr.     | mor, killed,    | mar, written,  |\r\n    |      | make one-eyed) | mo^ir^i,       | fem. sing.)     | mor^u, killed, |\r\n    |      | (like a long   | killed, masc.  |                 | masc. sing.)   |\r\n    |      | German o)      | plur.)         |                 |                |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 |                |\r\n    |  i.  |       --       |        --      | yu (liv^u, pr.  | yu (liv^u, pr. |\r\n    |      |                |                | lyuv, plastered,| lyuv, written  |\r\n    |      |                |                | fem. sing.)     | lyuv^u, plas-  |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | tered, masc.   |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | sing.)         |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 |                |\r\n    |  /i. |       --       |        --      |        --       | yu (nil^u, pr. |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | nyul, written  |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | nyul^u, blue,  |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | masc. sing.)   |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 |                |\r\n    |  u.  |       --       | u^i (gur^i, pr.|        --       |       --       |\r\n    |      |                | gu^ir^i,       |                 |                |\r\n    |      |                | horses)        |                 |                |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 |                |\r\n    |  /u. |       --       | u^i (gur^i, pr.|        --       |       --       |\r\n    |      |                | gu^ir^i,       |                 |                |\r\n    |      |                | cowherds)      |                 |                |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 |                |\r\n    |  )e. | i (led^ar,     |        --      | yu (tsel^u, pr. | yu (tsel^u, pr.|\r\n    |      | pr. lid^ar,    |                | tsyul, squeezed,| tsyul, written |\r\n    |      | be yellow)     |                | fem. sing.)     | tsyul^u,       |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | squeezed,      |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | masc. sing.)   |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 |                |\r\n    |  /e. |       --       | i (pher^i, pr. | i (pher^u, pr.  | yu (pher^u pr. |\r\n    |      |                | and written    | phir, written,  | phyur, written |\r\n    |      |                | phir^i, turned,| phir^u, turned, | phyur^u,       |\r\n    |      |                | masc. plur.)   | fem. sing.)     | turned, masc.  |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 | sing.)         |\r\n    |      |                |                |                 |                |\r\n    |  )o. | u (hokh^ar,    | o^i (woth^i,   | u (woth^u, pr.  | o (woth^u pr.  |\r\n    |      | pr. hukh^ar,   | pr.

Thus _rawukh_, they have lost, is pronounced\r\n  _rawukh_, and, in the native character, is written _rowukh_.\r\n  Similarly _malis_ becomes _malis_ (_molis_). The diphthong _ai_ is\r\n  pronounced _o_ when it commences a word; thus, _aith_, eight, is\r\n  pronounced _oth_. When _i_ and _u_ commence a word they are pronounced\r\n  _yi_ and _wu_ respectively. With one important exception, common to\r\n  all Pisaca languages, Kashmiri employs every consonant found in the\r\n  Sanskrit alphabet. The exception is the series of aspirated\r\n  consonants, _gh_, _jh_, _dh_, _dh_ and _bh_, which are wanting in\r\n  Ksh., the corresponding unaspirated consonants being substituted for\r\n  them. Thus, Skr. _ghotakas_, but Ksh. _gur^u_, a horse; Skr.\r\n  _bhavati_, Ksh. _bovi_, he will be. There is a tendency to use dental\r\n  letters where Hindi employs cerebrals, as in Hindi _uth_, Ksh. _woth_,\r\n  arise. Cerebral letters are, however, owing to Sanskrit influence, on\r\n  the whole better preserved in Ksh. than in the other Pisaca languages.\r\n  The cerebral _s_ has almost disappeared, _s_ being employed instead.\r\n  The only common word in which it is found is the numeral _sah_, six,\r\n  which is merely a learned spelling for _sah_, due to the influence of\r\n  the Skr. _sat_. From the palatals _c_, _ch_, _j_, a new series of\r\n  consonants has been formed, viz. _ts_, _tsh_ (aspirate of _ts_--i.e.\r\n  _ts_ + _h_, not _t_ + _sh_), and _z_ (as in English, not _dz_). Thus,\r\n  Skr. _coras_, Ksh. _tsur_, a thief; Skr. _chalayati_, Ksh. _tshali_,\r\n  he will deceive; Skr. _jalam_, Ksh. _zal_, water. The sibilant _s_,\r\n  and occasionally _s_, are frequently represented by _h_. Thus, Skr.\r\n  _dasa_, Ksh. _dah_, ten; Skr. _siras_, Ksh. _hir_, a head. We may\r\n  compare with this the Persian word _Hind_, India (compare the Greek\r\n  [Greek: Indos], an Indian), derived from the Skr. _Sindhus_, the river\r\n  Indus. When such an _h_ is followed by a palatal letter the _s_\r\n  returns; thus, from the base _his-_, like this, we have the nominative\r\n  masculine _hih^u_, but the feminine _his^u_, and the abstract noun\r\n  _hisyar_, because _^u_ and _y_ are palatal letters.\r\n\r\n  The palatal letters _i_, _e_, _u-matra_ and _y_ often change a\r\n  preceding consonant. The modifications will be seen from the following\r\n  examples: _rat-_, night; nom. plur. _rats^u_; _woth_, arise;\r\n  _wotsh^u_, she arose: _lad_, build; _laz^u_, she was built: _ran_,\r\n  cook; _ran^u_, she was cooked; _pat^u_, a tablet; Ag. sing. _paci_:\r\n  _kath-_, a stalk; nom. plur. _kache: bad-_, great; nom. plur. fem.\r\n  _baje_: _batuk^u_, a duck; fem. _bat^ac^u_: _hokh^u_, dry; fem.\r\n  _hoch^u; srog^u_, cheap; _srojyar_, cheapness: _wal^u_, a ring; fem.\r\n  _waj^u_, a small ring; _los_, be weary; _los^u_ or _lots^u_, she was\r\n  weary. These changes are each subject to certain rules. Cerebral\r\n  letters (_t_, _th_, _d_) change only before _i_, _e_ or _y_, and not\r\n  before _u-matra_. The others, on the contrary, do not change _i_, but\r\n  do change before _e_, _y_ or _u-matra_.\r\n\r\n  No word can end in an unaspirated surd consonant. If such a consonant\r\n  falls at the end of a word it is aspirated. Thus, _ak_, one, becomes\r\n  _akh_ (but acc. _akis_); _kat_, a ram, becomes _kath_; and hat, a\r\n  hundred, _hath_.\r\n\r\n  D. _Declension_. If the above phonetic rules are borne in mind,\r\n  declension in Kashmiri is a fairly simple process. If attention is not\r\n  paid to them, the whole system at once becomes a field of inextricable\r\n  confusion. In the following pages it will be assumed that the reader\r\n  is familiar with them.\r\n\r\n  Nouns substantive and adjective have two genders, a masculine and a\r\n  feminine. Words referring to males are masculine, and to females are\r\n  feminine. Inanimate things are sometimes masculine and sometimes\r\n  feminine. Pronouns have three genders, arranged on a different\r\n  principle. One gender refers to male living beings, another to female\r\n  living beings, and a third (or neuter) to all inanimate things whether\r\n  they are grammatically masculine or feminine. Nouns ending in _^u_ are\r\n  masculine, and most, but not all, of those ending in _^i_, _^u_, _e_\r\n  or _n_ are feminine. Of nouns ending in consonants, some are\r\n  masculine, and some are feminine. No rule can be formulated regarding\r\n  these, except that all abstract nouns ending in _ar_ (a very numerous\r\n  class) are masculine. There are four declensions. The first consists\r\n  of masculine nouns ending in a consonant, in _a_, _e_ or _^u_ (very\r\n  few of these last two). The second consists of the important class of\r\n  masculine nouns in _^u_; the third of feminine nouns in _^i_, _^u_, or\r\n  _n_ (being the feminines corresponding to the masculine nouns of the\r\n  second declension); and the fourth of feminine nouns ending in _^a_,\r\n  _e_ or a consonant.\r\n\r\n  The noun possesses two numbers, a singular and a plural, and in each\r\n  number there are, besides the nominative, three organic cases, the\r\n  accusative, the case of the agent (see below, under \"verbs\"), and the\r\n  ablative. The accusative, when not definite, may also be the same in\r\n  form as the nominative. The following are the forms which a noun takes\r\n  in each declension, the words chosen as examples being: First\r\n  declension, _tsur_, a thief; second declension, _mal^u_, a father;\r\n  third declension, _maj^u_, a mother; fourth declension, (a) _mal_, a\r\n  garland, (b) _rat-_, night.\r\n\r\n    +------+------------+----------------+------------+-------------------------+\r\n    |      |   First    |     Second     |   Third    |    Fourth Declension.   |\r\n    |      | Declension.|   Declension.  | Declension.|   a.          b.        |\r\n    +------+------------+----------------+------------+-------+-----------------+\r\n    |Sing.:|            |                |            |       |                 |\r\n    | Nom. | tsur       | mal^u (pr. mal)| maj^u (moj)| mal   | rath            |\r\n    | Acc. | tsuras     | malis (molis)  | maje       | mali  | rats^u (rots)   |\r\n    | Ag.  | tsuran     | mal^i (mo^il^i)| maji       | mali  | rats^u (rots)   |\r\n    | Abl. | tsura      | mali           | maji       | mali  | rats^u (rots)   |\r\n    |Plur.:|            |                |            |       |                 |\r\n    | Nom  | tsur       | mal^i (mo^il^i)| maje       | mala  | rats^u (rots)   |\r\n    | Acc. | tsuran     | malen          | majen      | malan | rats^un (rotsun)|\r\n    | Ag.  |            |                |            |       |                 |\r\n    |  and |            |                |            |       |                 |\r\n    | Abl. | tsurau     | malyau         | majyau     | malau | rats^uv (rotsuv)|\r\n    +------+------------+----------------+------------+-------+-----------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n  The declension 4_b_ is confined to certain nouns in _t_, _th_, _d_,\r\n  _n_, _h_ and _l_, in which the final consonant is liable to change\r\n  owing to a following _u-matra_.\r\n\r\n  Other cases are formed (as in true Indo-Aryan languages) by the\r\n  addition of postpositions, some of which are added to the accusative,\r\n  while others are added to the ablative case. To the former are added\r\n  _manz_, in; _kit^u_, to or for; _sutin_, with, and others. To the\r\n  ablative are added _sutin_, when it signifies \"by means of\"; _putshy_,\r\n  for; _peth^a_, from, and others. For the genitive, masculine nouns in\r\n  the singular, signifying animate beings, take _sand^u_, and if they\r\n  signify things without life, take _k^u_. All masculine plural nouns\r\n  and all feminine nouns whether singular or plural take _hand^u_.\r\n  _Sand^u_ and _hand^u_ are added to the accusative, which drops a final\r\n  _s_, while _k^u_ is added to the ablative. Thus, _tsura sand^u_, of\r\n  the thief; _mal^i sand^u_, of the father; _sonak^u_ (usually written\r\n  _sonuk^u_), of gold (_son_, abl. sing. _sona_); _tsuran nand^u_, of\r\n  thieves; _karen hand^u_, of bracelets (second declension); _maje\r\n  hand^u_, of the mother; _majen hand^u_, of the mothers. Masculine\r\n  proper names, however, take _n^u_ in the singular, as in\r\n  _Radhakrsnan^u_ of Radhakrishna. These genitive terminations, and also\r\n  the dative termination _kit^u_, are adjectives, and agree with the\r\n  governing noun in gender, number and case. Thus, _tsura sand^u\r\n  neciv^u_, the son of the thief; _tsura sand^i neciv^i_, by the son of\r\n  the thief; _tsura sanz^u kor^u_, the daughter of the thief; _kulik^u\r\n  lang_, a bough of the tree; _kulic^u land^u_, a twig of the tree.\r\n  _Sand^u_, has fem. sing. _sanz^u_, masc. plur. _sand^i_, fem. plur.\r\n  _sanza_. Similarly _hand^u_. _K^u_ has fem. sing. _c^u_, masc. plur.\r\n  _k^i_, fem. plur. _ce_; _n^u_, fem. sing. _n_, masc. plur. _n^i_, fem.\r\n  plur. _ne_. Similarly for the dative we have the following forms:\r\n  _malis kit^u pan^u_, water (masc.) for the father; _malis kits^u gav_,\r\n  a cow for the father; _malis kit^i rav_, blankets (masc. plur.) for\r\n  the father; _malis kitsa pothe_, books (fem. plur.) for the father.\r\n  All these postpositions of the genitive and _kit^u_ of the dative are\r\n  declined regularly as substantives, the masculine ones belonging to\r\n  the second declension and the feminine ones to the third. Note that\r\n  the feminine plural of _sand^u_ is _sanza_, not _sanze_, as we might\r\n  expect; so also feminine nouns in _ts^u_, _tsh^u_, _z^u_ and _s^u_.\r\n\r\n  Adjectives ending in _^u_ (second declension) form the feminine in\r\n  _^u_, with the usual changes of the preceding consonant. Thus _tat^u_,\r\n  hot, fem. _tats^u_ (pronounced _tuts_). Other adjectives do not change\r\n  for gender. All adjectives agree with the qualified noun in gender,\r\n  number and case, the postposition, if any, being added to the latter\r\n  word of the two. Take, for example, _chat^u_, white, and _gur^u_, a\r\n  horse. From these we have _chat^u gur^u_, a white horse; acc. sing.\r\n  _chatis guris_; nom. plur. _chat^i gur^i_; and _chatyau guryau sutin_,\r\n  by means of white horses.\r\n\r\n  The first two personal pronouns are _boh_, I; _me_, me, by me; _as^i_,\r\n  we; _ase_, us, by us; and _ts^ah_, thou; _tse_, thee, by thee;\r\n  _toh^i_, ye; _tohe_ you, by you. Possessive pronouns are employed\r\n  instead of the genitive. Thus, _myan^u_, my; _san^u_, our; _cyan^u_,\r\n  thy; _tuhand^u_, your. For the third person, we have sing. masc.\r\n  _suh_, fem. _soh_, neut. _tih_; acc. sing. (masc. or fem.) _tamis_ or\r\n  _tas_, neut. _tath_; agent sing. masc. neut. _tam^i_, fem. _tami_. The\r\n  plural is of common gender throughout. Nom. _tim_; acc. _timan_; ag.\r\n  _timau_. The possessive pronoun is _tasand^u_, of him, of her;\r\n  _tamyuk^n_, of it; _tihand^u_, of them. The neuter gender is used for\r\n  all things without life.\r\n\r\n  Other pronouns are:--This: _yih_ (com. gen.); acc. masc. fem. _yimis_,\r\n  or _nomis_, neut, _yith_, _noth_; ag. masc. neut., _yim^i_, _nom^i_,\r\n  fem. _yimi_, _nomi_; nom. plur. _yim_, fem. _yima_, and so on.\r\n\r\n  That (within sight): masc. neut. _huh_, fem. _hoh_; acc. masc. fem.\r\n  _humis_ or _amis_, neut. _huth_, and so on; nom. plur. masc _hum_.\r\n\r\n  Who, masc. _yus_, fem. _yossa_, neut. _yih_; acc. masc. fem. _yemis_,\r\n  _yes_, neut. _yeth_; ag. masc. neut. _yem^i_, fem. _yemi_; nom. plur.\r\n  masc. _yim_, and so on.\r\n\r\n  Who? masc. _kus_, fem. _kossa_, neut. _kyah_; acc. masc. fem. _kamis_,\r\n  _kas_, neut. _kath_; ag. masc. neut. _kam^i_, fem. _kami_; nom. plur.\r\n  masc. _kam_.\r\n\r\n  Self, _pana_. Anyone, someone, _kah_, _kuh_, or _katshah_, neut.\r\n  _ketshah_.\r\n\r\n  Kashmiri makes very free use of pronominal suffixes, which are added\r\n  to verbs to supply the place of personal terminations. These represent\r\n  almost any case, and are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    +--------+---------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n    |        | First Person. | Second Person. | Third Person. |\r\n    |        +---------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n    | Sing.--|               |                |               |\r\n    |  Nom.  |      _s_      |    _kh_, _h_   |      none     |\r\n    |  Acc.  |      _m_      |    _th_, _y_   |      _s_      |\r\n    |  Dat.  |      _m_      |       _y_      |      _s_      |\r\n    |  Ag.   |      _m_      |    _th_, _y_   |      _n_      |\r\n    | Plur.--|               |                |               |\r\n    |  Nom.  |      none     |      _wa_      |      none     |\r\n    | Other  |               |                |               |\r\n    |  cases |      none     |      _wa_      |   _kh_, _h_   |\r\n    +--------+---------------+----------------+---------------+\r\n\r\n  Before these the verbal terminations are often slightly changed for\r\n  the sake of euphony, and, when necessary for the pronunciation, the\r\n  vowel _a_ is inserted as a junction vowel.\r\n\r\n  In this connexion we may mention another set of suffixes also commonly\r\n  added to verbs, with an adverbial force. Of these _na_ negatives the\r\n  verb, as in _chuh_, he is; _chuna_, he is not; _a_ asks a question,\r\n  as in _chwa_, is he? _ti_ adds emphasis, as in _chuti_, he is indeed;\r\n  and _tya_ asks a question with emphasis, as in _chutya_, is he indeed?\r\n\r\n  Two or three suffixes may be employed together, as in _kar^u_, was\r\n  made, _karu-m_, was made by me, _kar^u-m-akh_, thou wast made by me;\r\n  _kar^u-m-akh-a_, wast thou made by me? The two _kh_ suffixes become\r\n  _h_ when they are followed by a pronominal suffix commencing with a\r\n  vowel, as in _kar^u-h-as_ (for _kar^u-kh-as_), I was made by them.\r\n\r\n  E. _Conjugation._ As in the case of the modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars,\r\n  the conjugation of the verb is mainly participial. Three only of the\r\n  old tenses, the present, the future and the imperative have survived,\r\n  the first having become a future, and the second a past conditional.\r\n  These three we may call radical tenses. The rest, viz. the Kashmiri\r\n  present, imperfect, past, aorist, perfect and other past tenses are\r\n  all participial.\r\n\r\n  The verb substantive, which is also used as an auxiliary verb, has two\r\n  tenses, a present and a past. The former is made by adding the\r\n  pronominal suffixes of the nominative to a base _chu(h)_, and the\r\n  latter by adding the same to a base _as^u_. Thus:--\r\n\r\n    +---+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |               _Singular_             |               _Plural_             |\r\n    |   +------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n    |   |     Masculine    |      Feminine     |     Masculine    |     Feminine    |\r\n    +---+------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n    | 1 | chu-s , I am     | che-s, I am       | _chih_, we are   | _cheh_, we are  |\r\n    | 2 | chu-kh, thou art | che-kh, thou art  | chi-wa, you are  | che-wa, you are |\r\n    | 3 | chuh, he is      | cheh, she is      | chih, they are   | cheh, they are  |\r\n    +---+------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n    | 1 | asu-s, I was     | as^u-s, I was     | as^i, we were    | asa, we were    |\r\n    | 2 | asu-kh, thou wast| as^u-kh, thou wast| as^i-wa, you were| asa-wa, you were|\r\n    | 3 | as^u, he was     | as^u, she was     | as^i, they were  | asa, they were  |\r\n    +---+------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\n  As for the finite verb, the modern future (old present), and the past\r\n  conditional (old future) do not change for gender, and do not employ\r\n  suffixes, but retain relics of the old personal terminations of the\r\n  tenses from which they are derived. They are thus conjugated, taking\r\n  the verbal root _kar_, as the typical verb.\r\n\r\n    +---+--------------------------+--------------------------------------|\r\n    |   | Future, I shall make, &c.|Past Conditional, (if) I had made, &c.|\r\n    |   +------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------------+\r\n    |   | _Singular_ |   _Plural_  |    _Singular_   |      _Plural_      |\r\n    +---+------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------------+\r\n    | 1 |   kara     |    karav    |    karaha       |      karahav       |\r\n    | 2 |   karakh   |    kariv    |    karahakh     |      kar^ihiv      |\r\n    | 3 |   kari     |    karan    |    karihe       |      karahan       |\r\n    +---+------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------------+\r\n\r\n  For the imperative we have 2nd person singular, _kar_, plur. _kariv_;\r\n  third person singular and plural _karin_.\r\n\r\n  Many of the above forms will be intelligible from a consideration of\r\n  the closely allied Sanskrit, although they are not derived from that\r\n  language; but some (e.g. those of the second person singular) can only\r\n  be explained by the analogy of the Iranian and of the Pisaca\r\n  languages.\r\n\r\n  The present participle is formed by adding _an_ to the root; thus,\r\n  _karan_, making. It does not change for gender. From this we get a\r\n  present and an imperfect, formed by adding respectively the present\r\n  and past tenses of the auxiliary verb. Thus, _karan chus_, I\r\n  (masculine) am making, I make; _karan ches_, I (feminine) am making, I\r\n  make; _karan asus_, I (masculine) was making; and so on.\r\n\r\n  There are several past participles, all of which are liable to change\r\n  for gender, and are utilized in conjugation. We have:--\r\n\r\n    +-------------------------+--------------------------+------------------------+\r\n    |                         |        _Singular_        |        _Plural_        |\r\n    |                         +------------+-------------+------------+-----------+\r\n    |                         |  Masculine |   Feminine  |  Masculine |  Feminine |\r\n    +-------------------------+------------+-------------+------------+-----------+\r\n    | Weak past participle    | kar^u      | kar^u       | kar^i      | kare      |\r\n    | Strong past participle  | karyov     | karyeya     | karyey     | karyeya   |\r\n    | Pluperfect participle   | karyav     | karyeya     | kareyey    | karyeya   |\r\n    | Compound past participle| kar^umat^u | kar^umats^u | kar^imat^i | karematsa |\r\n    +-------------------------+------------+-------------+------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n  In the strong past participle and the pluperfect participle, the final\r\n  _v_ and _y_ (like the final _h_ of _chuh_ quoted above) are not parts\r\n  of the original words, but are only added for the sake of euphony. The\r\n  true words are _karyo_, _karye_, _karya_ and _karyeye_. There are\r\n  three conjugations. The first includes all transitive verbs. These\r\n  have both the weak and the strong past participles. The second\r\n  conjugation consists of sixty-six common intransitive verbs, which\r\n  also have both of these participles. The third conjugation consists of\r\n  the remaining intransitive verbs. These have only the strong past\r\n  participle. The weak past participle in the first two conjugations\r\n  refers to something which has lately happened, and is used to form an\r\n  immediate past tense. The strong past participle is more indefinite,\r\n  and is employed to form a tense corresponding to the Greek aorist. The\r\n  pluperfect participle refers to something which happened a long time\r\n  ago, and is used to form the past tense of narration. As the third\r\n  conjugation has no weak past participle, the strong past participle is\r\n  employed to make the immediate past, and the pluperfect participle is\r\n  employed to make the aorist past, while the new pluperfect participle\r\n  is formed to make the tense of narration. Thus, from the root _wuph_,\r\n  fly (third conjugation) we have _wuphyov_, he flew just now, while\r\n  _karyov_ (first conjugation) means \"he was made at some indefinite\r\n  time\"; _wuphyav_, he flew at some indefinite time, but _karyav_, he\r\n  was made a long time ago; finally, the new participle of the third\r\n  conjugation, _wuphiyav_, he flew a long time ago.\r\n\r\n  The corresponding tenses are formed by adding pronominal suffixes to\r\n  the weak, the strong, or the pluperfect participle. In the last two\r\n  the final _v_ and _y_, being no longer required by euphony, are\r\n  dropped. In the case of transitive verbs the participles are passive\r\n  by derivation and in signification, and hence the suffix indicating\r\n  the subject must be in the agent case. Thus _kar^u_ means \"made.\" For\r\n  \"I made\" we must say \"made by me,\" _karu-m_; for \"thou madest,\"\r\n  _karu-th_, made by thee, and so on. If the thing made is feminine the\r\n  participle must be feminine, and similarly if it is plural it must be\r\n  plural. Thus, _karu-m_, I made him; _kar^u-m_, I made her; _kari-m_, I\r\n  made them (masculine); and _kare-m_, I made them (feminine). Similarly\r\n  from the other two participles we have _karyo-m_, I made him;\r\n  _karyeya-m_, I made her; _karya-m_, I made him (a long time ago). The\r\n  past participles of intransitive verbs are not passive, and hence the\r\n  suffix indicating the subject must be in the nominative form. Thus\r\n  _tsal^u_, escaped (second conjugation); _tsalu-s_, escaped-I, I\r\n  (masculine) escaped; _tsaj^u-s_, I (feminine) escaped, and so on.\r\n  Similarly for the third conjugation, _wuphyov_, flew; _wuphyo-s_, I\r\n  (masculine) flew; _wuphyeya-s_, I (feminine) flew, &c.\r\n\r\n  As explained above, these suffixes may be piled one on another. As a\r\n  further example we may give _kar^u_, made; _karu-n_, made by him, he\r\n  made; _karu-n-as_, made by him I, he made me, or (as -_s_ also means\r\n  \"for him\") he made for him; _karu-n-as-a_, did he make me? or, did he\r\n  make for him? and so on.\r\n\r\n  Tenses corresponding to the English perfect and pluperfect are formed\r\n  by conjugating the auxiliary verb, adding the appropriate suffixes,\r\n  with the compound past participle. Thus _kar^umat^u chu-n-as_, made\r\n  am-by-him-I, he has made me; _tsal^umat^u chu-kh_, escaped art thou,\r\n  thou hast escaped; _wuphyomat^u chu-s_, flown am-I, I have flown.\r\n  Similarly for the pluperfect, _kar^umat^u asu-n-as_, made\r\n  was-by-him-I, he had made me, and so on.\r\n\r\n  Many verbs have irregular past participles. Thus _mar_, die, has\r\n  _mud^u_; _di_, give, has _dit^u_; _khi_, eat, has _khyauv_ for its\r\n  weak, and _kheyov_ for its strong participle, while _ni_, take, has\r\n  _nyuv_ and _niyov_, respectively. Others must be learnt from the\r\n  regular grammars.\r\n\r\n  The infinitive is formed by adding -_un_ to the root; thus _kar-un_,\r\n  to make. It is declined like a somewhat irregular noun of the first\r\n  declension, its accusative being _karanas_. There are three forms of\r\n  the noun of agency, of which typical examples are _kar-awun^u_,\r\n  _kar-an-wal^u_, and _kar-an-grakh_, a maker.\r\n\r\n  The passive is formed by conjugating the verb _yi_, come, with the\r\n  ablative of the infinitive. Thus, _karana yiwan chuh_, it is coming by\r\n  making, or into making, i.e. it is being made. A root is made active\r\n  or causal by adding -_anaw_, -_aw_, or -_^araw_. Thus, _kar-anaw_,\r\n  cause to make; _kumal_, be tender, _kumal-aw_, make tender; _kal_, be\r\n  dumb, _kal-^araw_, make dumb. Some verbs take one form and some\r\n  another, and there are numerous irregularities, especially in the case\r\n  of the last.\r\n\r\n  F. _Indeclinables._ Indeclinables (adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions\r\n  and interjections) must be learnt from the dictionary. The number of\r\n  interjections is very large, and they are distinguished by minute\r\n  rules depending on the gender of the person addressed and the exact\r\n  amount of respect due to him.\r\n\r\n_Literature._--Kashmiri possesses a somewhat extensive literature, which\r\nhas been very little studied. The missionary William Carey published in\r\n1821 a version of the New Testament (in the Sarada character), which was\r\nthe first book published in the language. In 1885 the Rev. J. Hinton\r\nKnowles published at Bombay a collection of Kashmiri proverbs and\r\nsayings, and K. F. Burkhard in 1895 published an edition of Mahmud\r\nGami's poem on Yusuf and Zulaikha. This, with the exception of later\r\ntranslations of the Scriptures in the Persian character and a few minor\r\nworks, is all the literature that has been printed or about which\r\nanything has been written. Mahmud Gami's poem is valuable as an example\r\nof the Kashmiri used by Mussulmans. For Hindu literature, we may quote a\r\nhistory of Krishna by Dinanatha. The very popular _Lalla-vakya_, a poem\r\non Saiva philosophy by a woman named _Lalladevi_, is said to be the\r\noldest work in the language which has survived. Another esteemed work is\r\nthe _Siva Parinaya_ of Krsna Rajanaka, a living author. These and other\r\nbooks which have been studied by the present writer have little\r\nindependent value, being imitations of Sanskrit literature. Nothing is\r\nknown about the dates of most of the authors.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The scientific study of Kashmiri is of very recent date.\r\n  The only printed lexicographical work is a short vocabulary by W. J.\r\n  Elmslie (London, 1872). K. F. Burkhard brought out a grammar of the\r\n  Mussulman dialect in the _Proceedings of the Royal Bavarian Academy of\r\n  Science_ for 1887-1889, of which a translation by G. A. Grierson\r\n  appeared in the _Indian Antiquary_ of 1895 and the following years\r\n  (reprinted as a separate publication, Bombay, 1897). T. R. Wade's\r\n  Grammar (London, 1888) is the merest sketch, and the only attempt at a\r\n  complete work of the kind in English is G. A. Grierson's _Essays on\r\n  Kacmiri Grammar_ (London and Calcutta, 1899). A valuable native\r\n  grammar in Sanskrit, the _Kasmirasabdamrta_ of Isvara Kaula, has been\r\n  edited by the same writer (Calcutta, 1888). For an examination of the\r\n  origin of Kashmiri grammatical forms and the Pisaca question\r\n  generally, see G. A. Grierson's \"On Certain Suffixes in the Modern\r\n  Indo-Aryan Vernaculars\" in the _Zeitschrift fur Vergleichende\r\n  Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete der Indogermanischen Sprachen_ for\r\n  1903 and _The Pisaca Languages of North-Western India_ (London, 1906).\r\n\r\n  The only important text which has been published is Burkhard's\r\n  edition, with a partial translation, of Mahmud Gami's \"Yusuf and\r\n  Zulaikha\" in the _Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen\r\n  Gesellschaft_ for 1895 and 1899. The text of the _Siva Parinaya_,\r\n  edited by G. A. Grierson, is in course of publication by the Asiatic\r\n  Society of Bengal.     (G. A. Gr.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] See G. A.

They have no literature and no history, as they consist of\r\npeasants and fishermen, the educated classes being mostly Germans or\r\nPoles. Their language has been held to be but a dialect of Polish, but\r\nit seems better to separate it, as in some points it is quite\r\nindependent, in some it offers a resemblance to the language of the\r\nPolabs (q.v.). This is most seen in the western dialect of the so-called\r\nSlovinci (of whom there are about 250 left) and Kabatki, whereas the\r\neastern Kashube is more like Polish, which is encroaching upon and\r\nassimilating it. Lorentz calls the western dialect a language, and\r\ndistinguishes 38 vowels. The chief points of Kashube as against Polish\r\nare that all its vowels can be nasal instead of a and e only, that it\r\nhas preserved quantity and a free accent, has developed several special\r\nvowels, e.g. _o, oe, u_, and has preserved the original order, e.g.\r\n_gard_ as against _grod_. The consonants are very like Polish. (See also\r\nSLAVS.)\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--F. Lorentz, _Slovinzische Grammatik_ (St Petersburg,\r\n  1903) and \"Die gegenseitigen Verhaltnisse der sogen.

Pop.\r\n(1897), 13,545, of whom about 1000 were Tatars. It is famed for its\r\ntanneries and leather goods, sheepskins and post-horse bells. Founded in\r\n1152, it was formerly known as Meshcherski Gorodets. In the 15th century\r\nit became the capital of a Tatar khanate, subject to Moscow, and so\r\nremained until 1667. The town possesses a cathedral, and a mosque\r\nsupposed to have been built by Kasim, founder of the Tatar principality.\r\nNear the mosque stands a mausoleum built by Shah-Ali in 1555. Lying on\r\nthe direct road from Astrakhan to Moscow and Nizhniy-Novgorod, Kasimov\r\nis a place of some trade, and has a large annual fair in July. The\r\nwaiters in the best hotels of St Petersburg are mostly Kasimov Tatars.\r\n\r\n  See Veliaminov-Zernov, _The Kasimov Tsars_ (St Petersburg, 1863-1866).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASSA (Germ. _Kaschau_; Lat. _Cassovia_), the capital of the county of\r\nAbauj-Torna, in Hungary, 170 m. N.E. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900),\r\n35,856. Kassa is one of the oldest and handsomest towns of Hungary, and\r\nis pleasantly situated on the right bank of the Hernad. It is surrounded\r\non three sides by hills covered with forests and vineyards, and opens to\r\nthe S.E. towards a pretty valley watered by the Hernad and the Tarcza.\r\nKassa consists of the inner town, which was the former old town\r\nsurrounded with walls, and of three suburbs separated from it by a\r\nbroad glacis. The most remarkable building, considered the grandest\r\nmasterpiece of architecture in Hungary, is the Gothic cathedral of St\r\nElizabeth. Begun about 1270 by Stephen V., it was continued (1342-1382)\r\nby Queen Elizabeth, wife of Charles I., and her son Louis I., and\r\nfinished about 1468, in the reign of Matthias I. (Corvinus). The\r\ninterior was transformed in the 18th century to the Renaissance style,\r\nand the whole church thoroughly restored in 1877-1896. The church of St\r\nMichael and the Franciscan or garrison church date from the 13th\r\ncentury. The royal law academy, founded in 1659, and sanctioned by\r\ngolden bull of King Leopold I. in 1660, has an extensive library; there\r\nare also a museum, a Roman Catholic upper gymnasium and seminary for\r\npriests, and other schools and benevolent institutions. Kassa is the see\r\nof a Roman Catholic bishopric. It is the chief political and commercial\r\ntown of Upper Hungary, and the principal _entrepot_ for the commerce\r\nbetween Hungary and Galicia. Its most important manufactures are\r\ntobacco, machinery, iron, furniture, textiles and milling. About 3 m.\r\nN.W. of the town are the baths of Banko, with alkaline and ferruginous\r\nsprings, and about 12 m. N.E. lies Rank-Herlein, with an intermittent\r\nchalybeate spring. About 20 m. W. of Kassa lies the famous\r\nPremonstratensian abbey of Jaszo, founded in the 12th century. The abbey\r\ncontains a rich library and valuable archives. In the neighbourhood is a\r\nfine stalactite grotto, which often served as a place of refuge to the\r\ninhabitants in war time.\r\n\r\nKassa was created a town and granted special privileges by Bela IV. in\r\n1235, and was raised to the rank of a royal free town by Stephen V. in\r\n1270. In 1290 it was surrounded with walls. The subsequent history\r\npresents a long record of revolts, sieges and disastrous conflagrations.\r\nIn 1430 the plague carried off a great number of the inhabitants. In\r\n1458 the right of minting money according to the pattern and value of\r\nthe Buda coinage was granted to the municipality by King Matthias I. The\r\nbishopric was established in 1804. In the revolutionary war of 1848-49\r\nthe Hungarians were twice defeated before the walls of Kassa by the\r\nAustrians under General Schlick, and the town was held successively by\r\nthe Austrians, Hungarians and Russians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASSALA, a town and _mudiria_ of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The town, a\r\nmilitary station of some importance, lies on the river Gash (Mareb) in\r\n15 deg. 28' N., 36 deg. 24' E., 260 m. E.S.E. of Khartum and 240 m. W.\r\nof Massawa, the nearest seaport. Pop. about 20,000. It is built on a\r\nplain, 1700 ft. above the sea, at the foot of the Abyssinian highlands\r\n15 m. W. of the frontier of the Italian colony of Eritrea. Two\r\ndome-shaped mountains about 2600 ft. high, jebels Mokram and Kassala,\r\nrise abruptly from the plain some 3 m. to the east and south-east. These\r\nmountains and the numerous gardens Kassala contains give to the place a\r\npicturesque appearance. The chief buildings are of brick, but most of\r\nthe natives dwell in grass _tukls_. A short distance from the town is\r\nKhatmia, containing a tomb mosque with a high tower, the headquarters of\r\nthe Morgani family. The sheikhs El Morgani are the chiefs of a religious\r\nbrotherhood widely spread and of considerable influence in the eastern\r\nSudan. The Morgani family are of Afghan descent. Long settled in Jidda,\r\nthe head of the family removed to the Sudan about 1800 and founded the\r\nMorgani sect. Kassala was founded by the Egyptians in 1840 as a\r\nfortified post from which to control their newly conquered territory\r\nnear the Abyssinian frontier. In a few years it grew into a place of\r\nsome importance. In November 1883 it was besieged by the dervishes. The\r\ngarrison held out till the 30th of July 1885 when owing to lack of food\r\nthey capitulated. Kassala was captured from the dervishes by an Italian\r\nforce under Colonel Baratieri on the 17th of July 1894 and by the\r\nItalians was handed over on Christmas day 1897 to Egypt. The bulk of the\r\ninhabitants are Hallenga \"Arabs.\"\r\n\r\nKassala _mudiria_ contains some of the most fertile land in the\r\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan. It corresponds roughly with the district formerly\r\nknown as Taka. It is a region of light rainfall, and cultivation depends\r\nchiefly on the Gash flood. The river is however absolutely dry from\r\nOctober to June. White durra of excellent quality is raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASSASSIN, a village of Lower Egypt 22 m. by rail W. of Ismailia on the\r\nSuez Canal. At this place, on the 28th of August and again on the 9th of\r\nSeptember 1882 the British force operating against Arabi Pasha was\r\nattacked by the Egyptians--both attacks being repulsed (see EGYPT:\r\n_Military Operations_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASSITES, an Elamite tribe who played an important part in the history\r\nof Babylonia. They still inhabited the north-western mountains of Elam,\r\nimmediately south of Holwan, when Sennacherib attacked them in 702 B.C.\r\nThey are the Kossaeans of Ptolemy, who divides Susiana between them and\r\nthe Elymaeans; according to Strabo (xi. 13, 3, 6) they were the\r\nneighbours of the Medes. Th. Noldeke (_Gott. G. G._, 1874, pp. 173 seq.)\r\nhas shown that they are the Kissians of the older Greek authors who are\r\nidentified with the Susians by Aeschylus (_Choeph._ 424, Pers. 17, 120)\r\nand Herodotus (v. 49, 52). We already hear of them as attacking\r\nBabylonia in the 9th year of Samsu-iluna the son of Khammurabi, and\r\nabout 1780 B.C. they overran Babylonia and founded a dynasty there which\r\nlasted for 576 years and nine months. In the course of centuries,\r\nhowever, they were absorbed into the Babylonian population; the kings\r\nadopted Semitic names and married into the royal family of Assyria. Like\r\nthe other languages of the non-Semitic tribes of Elam that of the\r\nKassites was agglutinative; a vocabulary of it has been handed down in a\r\ncuneiform tablet, as well as a list of Kassite names with their Semitic\r\nequivalents. It has no connexion with Indo-European, as has erroneously\r\nbeen supposed. Some of the Kassite deities were introduced into the\r\nBabylonian pantheon, and the Kassite tribe of Khabira seems to have\r\nsettled in the Babylonian plain.\r\n\r\n  See Fr. Delitzsch, _Die Sprache der Kossaer_ (1884).     (A. H. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASTAMUNI, or KASTAMBUL. (1) A vilayet of Asia Minor which includes\r\nPaphlagonia and parts of Pontus and Galatia. It is divided into four\r\nsanjaks--Kastamuni, Boli, Changra and Sinope--is rich in mineral wealth,\r\nand has many mineral springs and extensive forests, the timber being\r\nused for charcoal and building and the bark for tanning. The products\r\nare chiefly cereals, fruits, opium, cotton, tobacco, wool, ordinary\r\ngoat-hair and mohair, in which there is a large trade. There are\r\ncoal-mines at and near Eregli (anc. _Heracleia_) which yield steam coal\r\nnearly as good in quality as the English, but they are badly worked. Its\r\npopulation comprises about 993,000 Moslems and 27,000 Christians. (2)\r\nThe capital of the vilayet, the ancient _Castamon_, altitude 2500 ft.,\r\nsituated in the narrow valley of the Geuk Irmak (_Amnias_), and\r\nconnected by a carriage road, 54 m., with its port Ineboli on the Black\r\nSea. The town is noted for its copper utensils, but the famous copper\r\nmines about 36 m. N., worked from ancient times to the 19th century, are\r\nnow abandoned. There are over 30 mosques in the town, a dervish\r\nmonastery, and numerous theological colleges (_medresses_), and the\r\nMoslem inhabitants have a reputation for bigotry. The climate though\r\nsubject to extremes of heat and cold is healthy; in winter the roads are\r\noften closed by snow. The population of 16,000 includes about 2500\r\nChristians. Castamon became an important city in later Byzantine times.\r\nIt lay on the northern trunk-road to the Euphrates and was built round a\r\nstrong fortress whose ruins crown the rocky hill west of the town. It\r\nwas taken by the Danishmand Amirs of Sivas early in the 12th century,\r\nand passed to the Turks in 1393.     (J. G. C. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASTORIA (Turkish _Kesrie_), a city of Macedonia, European Turkey, in\r\nthe vilayet of Monastir, 45 m. S. by W. of Monastir (Bitolia). Pop.\r\n(1905), about 10,000, one-third of whom are Greeks, one-third Slavs, and\r\nthe remainder Albanians or Turks. Kastoria occupies part of a peninsula\r\non the western shore of Lake Kastoria, which here receives from the\r\nnorth its affluent the Zhelova. The lake is formed in a deep hollow\r\nsurrounded by limestone mountains, and is drained on the south by the\r\nBistritza, a large river which flows S.E. nearly to the Greek frontier,\r\nthen sharply turns N.E., and finally enters the Gulf of Salonica. The\r\nlake has an area of 20 sq. m., and is 2850 ft. above sea-level. Kastoria\r\nis the seat of an Orthodox archbishop. It is usually identified with the\r\nancient _Celetrum_, captured by the Romans under Sulpicius, during the\r\nfirst Macedonian campaign, 200 B.C., and better known for the defence\r\nmaintained by Bryennius against Alexis I. in 1084. A Byzantine wall with\r\nround towers runs across the peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKASUR, a town of British India, in the Lahore district of the Punjab,\r\nsituated on the north bank of the old bed of the river Beas, 34 m. S.E.\r\nof Lahore. Pop. (1901), 22,022. A Rajput colony seems to have occupied\r\nthe present site before the earliest Mahommedan invasion; but Kasur does\r\nnot appear in history until late in the Mussulman period, when it was\r\nsettled by a Pathan colony from beyond the Indus. It has an export trade\r\nin grain and cotton, and manufactures of cotton and leather goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATAGUM, the sub-province of the double province of Kano in the British\r\nprotectorate of Northern Nigeria. It lies approximately between 11 deg.\r\nand 13 deg. N. and 8 deg. 20' and 10 deg. 40' E. It is bounded N. by the\r\nFrench Sudan, E. by Bornu, S. by Bauchi, and W. by Kano. Katagum\r\nconsists of several small but ancient Mahommedan emirates--Katagum,\r\nMessau, Gummel, Hadeija, Machena, with a fringe of Bedde pagans on its\r\neastern frontier towards Bornu, and other pagans on the south towards\r\nBauchi. The Waube flows from Kano through the province via Hadeija and\r\nby Damjiri in Bornu to Lake Chad, affording a route for the transport of\r\ngoods brought by the Zungeru-Zaria-Kano railway to the headquarters of\r\nKatagum and western Bornu. Katagum is a fertile province inhabited by an\r\nindustrious people whose manufactures rival those of Kano.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the province of Katagum formed the debateable country\r\nbetween Bornu and the Hausa states. Though Mahommedan it resisted the\r\nFula invasion. Its northern emirates were for a long time subject to\r\nBornu, and its customs are nearly assimilated to those of Bornu. The\r\nprovince was taken under administrative control by the British in\r\nOctober 1903. In 1904 the capitals of Gummel, Hadeija, Messau and\r\nJemaari, were brought into touch with the administration and native and\r\nprovincial courts established. At the beginning of 1905 Katagum was\r\nincorporated as a sub-province with the province of Kano, and the\r\nadministrative organization of a double province was extended over the\r\nwhole. Hadeija, which is a very wealthy town and holds an important\r\nposition both as a source of supplies and a centre of trade, received a\r\ngarrison of mounted infantry and became the capital of the sub-province.\r\n\r\nHadeija was an old Habe town and its name, an evident corruption of\r\nKhadija, the name of the celebrated wife and first convert of Mahomet,\r\nis a strong presumption of the incorrectness of the Fula claim to have\r\nintroduced Islam to its inhabitants. The ruling dynasty of Hadeija was,\r\nhowever, overthrown by Fula usurpation towards the end of the 18th\r\ncentury, and the Fula ruler received a flag and a blessing from Dan\r\nFodio at the beginning of his sacred war in the opening years of the\r\n19th century. Nevertheless the habit of independence being strong in the\r\ntown of Hadeija the little emirate held its own against Sokoto, Bornu\r\nand all comers. Though included nominally within the province at Katagum\r\nit was the boast of Hadeija that it had never been conquered. It had\r\nmade nominal submission to the British in 1903 on the successful\r\nconclusion of the Kano-Sokoto campaign, and in 1905, as has been stated,\r\nwas chosen as the capital of the sub-province. The emir's attitude\r\nbecame, however, in the spring of 1906 openly antagonistic to the\r\nBritish and a military expedition was sent against him. The emir with\r\nhis disaffected chiefs made a plucky stand but after five hours' street\r\nfighting the town was reduced. The emir and three of his sons were\r\nkilled, and a new emir, the rightful heir to the throne, who had shown\r\nhimself in favour of a peaceful policy, was appointed. The offices of\r\nthe war chiefs in Hadeija were abolished and 150 yards of the town wall\r\nwere broken down.\r\n\r\nSlave dealing is at an end in Katagum. The military station at Hadeija\r\nforms a link in the chain of British forts which extends along the\r\nnorthern frontier of the protectorate. (See NIGERIA.)     (F. L. L.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATANGA, a district of Belgian Congo, forming the south-eastern part of\r\nthe colony. Area, approximately, 180,000 sq. m.; estimated population\r\n1,000,000. The natives are members of the Luba-Lunda group of Bantus.\r\nIt is a highly mineralized region, being specially rich in copper ore.\r\nGold, iron and tin are also mined. Katanga is bounded S. and S.E. by\r\nNorthern Rhodesia, and British capital is largely interested in the\r\ndevelopment of its resources, the administration of the territory being\r\nentrusted to a committee on which British members have seats. Direct\r\nrailway communication with Cape Town and Beira was established in 1909.\r\nThere is also a rail and river service via the Congo to the west coast.\r\n(See CONGO FREE STATE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATER, HENRY (1777-1835), English physicist of German descent, was born\r\nat Bristol on the 16th of April 1777. At first he purposed to study law;\r\nbut this he abandoned on his father's death in 1794, and entered the\r\narmy, obtaining a commission in the 12th regiment of foot, then\r\nstationed in India, where he rendered valuable assistance in the great\r\ntrigonometrical survey. Failing health obliged him to return to England;\r\nand in 1808, being then a lieutenant, he entered on a distinguished\r\nstudent career in the senior department of the Royal Military College at\r\nSandhurst. Shortly after he was promoted to the rank of captain. In 1814\r\nhe retired on half-pay, and devoted the remainder of his life to\r\nscientific research. He died at London on the 26th of April 1835.\r\n\r\nHis first important contribution to scientific knowledge was the\r\ncomparison of the merits of the Cassegrainian and Gregorian telescopes,\r\nfrom which (_Phil. Trans._, 1813 and 1814) he deduced that the\r\nilluminating power of the former exceeded that of the latter in the\r\nproportion of 5 : 2. This inferiority of the Gregorian he explained as\r\nbeing probably due to the mutual interference of the rays as they\r\ncrossed at the principal focus before reflection at the second mirror.\r\nHis most valuable work was the determination of the length of the\r\nsecond's pendulum, first at London and subsequently at various stations\r\nthroughout the country (_Phil. Trans._, 1818, 1819). In these researches\r\nhe skilfully took advantage of the well-known property of reciprocity\r\nbetween the centres of suspension and oscillation of an oscillating\r\nbody, so as to determine experimentally the precise position of the\r\ncentre of oscillation; the distance between these centres was then the\r\nlength of the ideal simple pendulum having the same time of oscillation.\r\nAs the inventor of the floating collimator, Kater rendered a great\r\nservice to practical astronomy (_Phil. Trans._, 1825, 1828). He also\r\npublished memoirs (_Phil. Trans._, 1821, 1831) on British standards of\r\nlength and mass; and in 1832 he published an account of his labours in\r\nverifying the Russian standards of length. For his services to Russia in\r\nthis respect he received in 1814 the decoration of the order of St.\r\nAnne; and the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n  His attention was also turned to the subject of compass needles, his\r\n  Bakerian lecture \"On the Best Kind of Steel and Form for a Compass\r\n  Needle\" (_Phil. Trans._, 1821) containing the results of many\r\n  experiments. The treatise on \"Mechanics\" in Lardner's _Cyclopaedia_\r\n  was partly written by him; and his interest in more purely\r\n  astronomical questions was evidenced by two communications to the\r\n  Astronomical Society's _Memoirs_ for 1831-1833--the one on an\r\n  observation of Saturn's outer ring, the other on a method of\r\n  determining longitude by means of lunar eclipses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATHA, a district in the northern division of Upper Burma, with an area\r\nof 6994 sq. m., 3730 of which consists of the former separate state of\r\nWuntho. It is bounded N. by the Upper Chindwin, Bhamo and Myitkyina\r\ndistricts, E. by the Kaukkwe River as far as the Irrawaddy, thence east\r\nof the Irrawaddy by the Shan State of Mong Mit (Momeik), and by the\r\nShweli River, S. by the Ruby Mines district and Shwebo, and W. by the\r\nUpper Chindwin district. Three ranges of hills run through the district,\r\nknown as the Minwun, Gangaw and Mangin ranges. They separate the three\r\nmain rivers--the Irrawaddy, the Meza and the Mu. The Minwun range runs\r\nfrom north to south, and forms for a considerable part of its length the\r\ndividing line between the Katha district proper and what formerly was\r\nthe Wuntho state. Its average altitude is between 1500 and 2000 ft. The\r\nGangaw range runs from the north of the district for a considerable\r\nportion of its length close to and down the right bank of the Irrawaddy\r\nas far as Tigyaing, where the Myatheindan pagoda gives its name to the\r\nlast point. Its highest point is 4400 ft., but the average is between\r\n1500 and 2000 ft. The Katha branch of the railway crosses it at Petsut,\r\na village 12 miles west of Katha town. The Mangin range runs through\r\nWuntho (highest peak, Maingthon, 5450 ft.).\r\n\r\nGold, copper, iron and lead are found in considerable quantities in the\r\ndistrict. The Kyaukpazat gold-mines, worked by an English company, gave\r\ngood returns, but the quartz reef proved to be a mere pocket and is now\r\nworked out. The iron, copper and lead are not now worked. Jade and\r\nsoapstone also exist, and salt is produced from brine wells. There are\r\nthree forest reserves in Katha, with a total area of 1119 sq. m. The\r\npopulation in 1901 was 176,223, an increase of 32% in the decade. The\r\nnumber of Shans is about half that of Burmese, and of Kadus half that of\r\nShans. The Shans are mostly in the Wuntho sub-division. Rice is the\r\nchief crop in the plains, tea, cotton, sesamum and hill rice in the\r\nhills. The valley of the Meza, which is very malarious, was used as a\r\nconvict settlement under Burmese rule. The district was first occupied\r\nby British troops in 1886, but it was not finally quieted till 1890,\r\nwhen the Wuntho sawbwa was deposed and his state incorporated in Katha\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nKATHA is the headquarters of the district. The principal means of\r\ncommunication are the Irrawaddy Flotilla steamers, which run between\r\nMandalay and Bhamo, and the railway which communicates with Sagaing to\r\nthe south and Myitkyina to the north. A ferry-steamer plies between\r\nKatha and Bhamo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATHIAWAR, or KATTYWAR, a peninsula of India, within the Gujarat\r\ndivision of Bombay, giving its name to a political agency. Total area,\r\nabout 23,400 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 2,645,805. These figures include a\r\nportion of the British district of Ahmedabad, a portion of the state of\r\nBaroda, and the small Portuguese settlement of Diu. The peninsula is\r\nbounded N. by the Runn of Cutch, E. by Ahmedabad district and the Gulf\r\nof Cambay, and S. and W. by the Arabian Sea. The extreme length is 220\r\nm.; the greatest breadth about 165 m. Generally speaking, the surface is\r\nundulating, with low ranges running in various directions. With the\r\nexception of the Tangha and Mandav hills, in the west of Jhalawar, and\r\nsome unimportant hills in Hallar, the northern portion of the country is\r\nflat; but in the south, from near Gogo, the Gir range runs nearly\r\nparallel with the coast, and at a distance of about 20 m. from it, along\r\nthe north of Babriawar and Sorath, to the neighbourhood of Girnar.\r\nOpposite this latter mountain is the solitary Osam hill, and then still\r\nfarther west is the Barada group, between Hallar and Barada, running\r\nabout 20 m. north and south from Gumli to Ranawao. The Girnar group of\r\nmountains is an important granitic mass, the highest peak of which rises\r\nto 3500 ft. The principal river is the Bhadar, which rises in the Mandav\r\nhills, and flowing S.W. falls into the sea at Navi-Bandar; it is\r\neverywhere marked by highly cultivated lands adjoining its course of\r\nabout 115 m. Other rivers are the Aji, Machhu and Satrunji--the last\r\nremarkable for romantic scenery. Four of the old races, the Jaitwas,\r\nChurasamas, Solunkis and Walas still exist as proprietors of the soil\r\nwho exercised sovereignty in the country prior to the immigration of the\r\nJhalas, Jadejas, Purmars, Kathis, Gohels, Jats, Mahommedans and\r\nMahrattas, between whom the country is now chiefly portioned out.\r\nKathiawar has many notable antiquities, comprising a rock inscription of\r\nAsoka, Buddhist caves, and fine Jain temples on the sacred hill of\r\nGirnar and at Palitana.\r\n\r\nThe political agency of Kathiawar has an area of 20,882 sq. m. In 1901\r\nthe population was 2,329,196, showing a decrease of 15% in the decade\r\ndue to the results of famine. The estimated gross revenue of the several\r\nstates is L1,278,000; total tribute (payable to the British, the gaekwar\r\nof Baroda and the nawab of Junagarh), L70,000. There are altogether 193\r\nstates of varying size and importance, of which 14 exercise independent\r\njurisdiction, while the rest are more or less under British\r\nadministration. The eight states of the first class are Junagaw,\r\nNawanagar, Bhaunagar, Porbandar, Dhrangadra, Morvi, Gondal and\r\nJafarabad. The headquarters of the political agent are at Rajkot, in the\r\ncentre of the peninsula, where also is the Rajkumar college, for the\r\neducation of the sons of the chiefs. There is a similar school for\r\n_girasias_, or chiefs of lower rank, at Gondal. An excellent system of\r\nmetre-gauge railways has been provided at the cost of the leading\r\nstates. Maritime trade is also very active, the chief ports being\r\nPorbandar, Mangrol and Verawal. In 1903-1904 the total sea-borne exports\r\nwere valued at L1,300,000, and the imports at L1,120,000. The\r\nprogressive prosperity of Kathiawar received a shock from the famine of\r\n1899-1900, which was felt everywhere with extreme severity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATKOV, MICHAEL NIKIFOROVICH (1818-1887), Russian journalist, was born\r\nin Moscow in 1818. On finishing his course at the university he devoted\r\nhimself to literature and philosophy, and showed so little individuality\r\nthat during the reign of Nicholas I. he never once came into\r\ndisagreeable contact with the authorities. With the Liberal reaction and\r\nstrong reform movement which characterized the earlier years of\r\nAlexander II.'s reign (1855-1881) he thoroughly sympathized, and for\r\nsome time he warmly advocated the introduction of liberal institutions\r\nof the British type, but when he perceived that the agitation was\r\nassuming a Socialistic and Nihilist tinge, and that in some quarters of\r\nthe Liberal camp indulgence was being shown to Polish national\r\naspirations, he gradually modified his attitude until he came to be\r\nregarded by the Liberals as a renegade. At the beginning of 1863 he\r\nassumed the management and editorship of the _Moscow Gazette_, and he\r\nretained that position till his death in 1887. During these twenty-four\r\nyears he exercised considerable influence on public opinion and even on\r\nthe Government, by representing with great ability the moderately\r\nConservative spirit of Moscow in opposition to the occasionally\r\nultra-Liberal and always cosmopolitan spirit of St Petersburg. With the\r\nSlavophils he agreed in advocating the extension of Russian influence in\r\nsouth-eastern Europe, but he carefully kept aloof from them and\r\ncondemned their archaeological and ecclesiastical sentimentality. Though\r\ngenerally temperate in his views, he was extremely incisive and often\r\nviolent in his modes of expressing them, so that he made many enemies\r\nand sometimes incurred the displeasure of the press-censure and the\r\nministers, against which he was more than once protected by Alexander\r\nIII. in consideration of his able advocacy of national interests. He is\r\nremembered chiefly as an energetic opponent of Polish national\r\naspirations, of extreme Liberalism, of the system of public instruction\r\nbased on natural science, and of German political influence. In this\r\nlast capacity he helped to prepare the way for the Franco-Russian\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATMANDU (less correctly KHATMANDU), the capital of the state of Nepal,\r\nIndia, situated on the bank of the Vishnumati river at its confluence\r\nwith the Baghmati, in 27 deg. 36' N., 85 deg. 24' E. The town, which is\r\nsaid to have been founded about 723, contains a population estimated at\r\n70,000, occupying 5000 houses made of brick, and usually from two to\r\nfour storeys high. Many of the houses have large projecting wooden\r\nwindows or balconies, richly carved. The maharaja's palace, a huge,\r\nrambling, ungainly building, stands in the centre of the town, which\r\nalso contains numerous temples. One of these, a wooden building in the\r\ncentre of the town, gives it its name (_kat_ = wood). The streets are\r\nextremely narrow, and the whole town very dirty. A British resident is\r\nstationed about a mile north of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATO, TAKA-AKIRA (1859-   ), Japanese statesman, was born at Nagoya, and\r\ncommenced life as an employee in the great firm of Mitsu Bishi. In 1887\r\nhe became private secretary to Count Okuma, minister of state for\r\nforeign affairs. Subsequently he served as director of a bureau in the\r\nfinance department, and from 1894 to 1899 he represented his country at\r\nthe court of St James. He received the portfolio of foreign affairs in\r\nthe fourth Ito cabinet (1900-1901), which remained in office only a few\r\nmonths. Appointed again to the same position in the Saionji cabinet\r\n(1906), he resigned after a brief interval, being opposed to the\r\nnationalization of the private railways, which measure the cabinet\r\napproved. He then remained without office until 1908, when he again\r\naccepted the post of ambassador in London. He was decorated with the\r\ngrand cross of St Michael and St George, and earned the reputation of\r\nbeing one of the strongest men among the junior statesmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATRINE, LOCH, a fresh-water lake of Scotland, lying almost entirely in\r\nPerthshire. The boundary between the counties of Perth and Stirling runs\r\nfrom Glengyle, at the head of the lake, down the centre to a point\r\nopposite Stronachlachar from which it strikes to the south-western shore\r\ntowards Loch Arklet. The loch, which has a south-easterly trend, is\r\nabout 8 m. long, and its greatest breadth is 1 m. It lies 364 ft. above\r\nthe sea-level. It occupies an area of 4(3/4) square miles and has a\r\ndrainage basin of 37(1/2) square miles. The average depth is 142 ft.,\r\nthe greatest depth being 495 ft. The average annual rainfall is 78\r\ninches. The mean temperature at the surface is 56.4 deg. F., and at the\r\nbottom 41 deg. F. The scenery has been immortalized in Sir Walter\r\nScott's _Lady of the Lake_. The surrounding hills are of considerable\r\naltitude, the most remarkable being the head of Ben A'an (1750 ft.) and\r\nthe grassy craigs and broken contour of Ben Venue (2393 ft.). It is fed\r\nby the Gyle and numerous burns, and drained by the Achray to Loch Achray\r\nand thence by the Black Avon to Loch Vennacher. Since 1859 it has formed\r\nthe chief source of the water-supply of Glasgow, the aqueduct leaving\r\nthe lake about 1(1/2) m. S.E. of Stronachlachar. By powers obtained in\r\n1885 the level of the lake was increased by 5 ft. by a system of sluices\r\nregulating the outflow of the Achray. One result of this damming up has\r\nbeen to submerge the Silver Strand and to curtail the dimensions of\r\nEllen's Isle. The principal points on the shores are Glengyle, formerly\r\na fastness of the Macgregors, the Trossachs, the Goblins' Cave on Ben\r\nVenue, and Stronachlachar (Gaelic, \"the mason's nose\"), from which there\r\nis a ferry to Coilachra on the opposite side. A road has been\r\nconstructed from the Trossachs for nearly six miles along the northern\r\nshore. During summer steamers ply between the Trossachs and\r\nStronachlachar and there is a daily service of coaches from the\r\nTrossachs to Callander (about 10 m.) and to Aberfoyle (9 m.), and\r\nbetween Stronachlachar, to Inversnaid on Loch Lomond (about 4(1/2) m.).\r\nThe road to Inversnaid runs through the Macgregors' country referred to\r\nin Scott's _Rob Roy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATSENA, an ancient state of the western Sudan, now included in the\r\nprovince of Kano in the British protectorate of Northern Nigeria.\r\nKatsena was amongst the oldest of the Hausa states. There exist\r\nmanuscripts which carry back its history for about 1000 years and\r\ntradition ascribes the origin of the Hausa population, which is known\r\nalso by the name of Habe or Habeche, to the union of Bajibda of Bagdad\r\nwith a prehistoric queen of Daura. The conquest of the Habe of Katsena\r\nby the Fula about the beginning of the 19th century made little\r\ndifference to the country. The more cultivated Habe were already\r\nMahommedan and the new rulers adopted the existing customs and system of\r\ngovernment. These were in many respects highly developed and included\r\nelaborate systems of taxation and justice.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the administrative district is a town of the same name,\r\nin 13 deg. N., 7 deg. 41' E., being 160 m. E. by S. of the city of\r\nSokoto, and 84 m. N.W. of Kano. The walls of Katsena have a circuit of\r\nbetween 13 and 14 miles, but only a small part of the enclosed space is\r\ninhabited. In the 17th and 18th centuries it appears to have been the\r\nlargest town in the Hausa countries, and its inhabitants at that time\r\nnumbered some 100,000. The date of the foundation of the present town\r\nmust be comparatively modern, for it is believed to have been moved from\r\nits ancient site and at the time of Leo Africanus (c. 1513) there was no\r\nplace of any considerable size in the province of Katsena. Before that\r\nperiod Katsena boasted of being the chief seat of learning throughout\r\nthe Hausa states and this reputation was maintained to the time of the\r\nFula conquest. In the beginning of the 19th century the town fell into\r\nthe hands of the Fula, but only after a protracted and heroic defence.\r\nIn March 1903 Sir F. Lugard visited Katsena on his way from Sokoto and\r\nthe emir and chiefs accepted British suzerainty without fighting. The\r\nKatsena district has since formed an administrative district in the\r\ndouble province of Kano and Katagum. The emir was unfaithful to his oath\r\nof allegiance to the British crown, and was deposed in 1904. His\r\nsuccessor was installed and took the oath of allegiance in December of\r\nthe same year. Katsena is a rich and populous district.\r\n\r\n  See the _Travels_ of Heinrich Barth (new ed., London, 1890, chs.\r\n  xxiii. and xxiv.). Consult also the _Annual Reports_ on Northern\r\n  Nigeria issued by the Colonial Office, London, particularly the Report\r\n  for 1902.\r\n\r\nKATSENA is also the name of a town in the district of Katsena-Allah, in\r\nthe province of Muri, Northern Nigeria. This district is watered by a\r\nriver of the same name which takes its rise in the mountains of the\r\nGerman colony of Cameroon, and flows into the Benue at a point above\r\nAbinsi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATSURA, TARO, MARQUESS (1847-   ), Japanese soldier and statesman, was\r\nborn in 1847 in Choshu. He commenced his career by fighting under the\r\nImperial banner in the civil war of the Restoration, and he displayed\r\nsuch talent that he was twice sent at public expense to Germany (in 1870\r\nand 1884) to study strategy and tactics. In 1886 he was appointed\r\nvice-minister of war, and in 1891 the command of division devolved on\r\nhim. He led the left wing of the Japanese army in the campaign of\r\n1894-95 against China, and made a memorable march in the depth of winter\r\nfrom the north-east shore of the Yellow Sea to Haicheng, finally\r\noccupying Niuchwang, and effecting a junction with the second army corps\r\nwhich moved up the Liaotung peninsula. For these services he received\r\nthe title of viscount. He held the portfolio of war from 1898 to 1901,\r\nwhen he became premier and retained office for four and a half years, a\r\nrecord in Japan. In 1902 his cabinet concluded the first _entente_ with\r\nEngland, which event procured for Katsura the rank of count. He also\r\ndirected state affairs throughout the war with Russia, and concluded the\r\noffensive and defensive treaty of 1905 with Great Britain, receiving\r\nfrom King Edward the grand cross of the order of St Michael and St\r\nGeorge, and being raised by the mikado to the rank of marquess. He\r\nresigned the premiership in 1905 to Marquess Saionji, but was again\r\ninvited to form a cabinet in 1908. Marquess Katsura might be considered\r\nthe chief exponent of conservative views in Japan. Adhering strictly to\r\nthe doctrine that ministries were responsible to the emperor alone and\r\nnot at all to the diet, he stood wholly aloof from political parties,\r\nonly his remarkable gift of tact and conciliation enabling him to govern\r\non such principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATTERFELTO (or KATERFELTO), GUSTAVUS (d. 1799), quack doctor and\r\nconjurer, was born in Prussia. About 1782 he came to London, where his\r\nadvertisements in the newspapers, headed \"Wonders! Wonders! Wonders!\"\r\nenabled him to trade most profitably upon the credulity of the public\r\nduring the widespread influenza epidemic of that year. His public\r\nentertainment, which, besides conjuring, included electrical and\r\nchemical experiments and demonstrations with the microscope, extracted a\r\nflattering testimonial from the royal family, who witnessed it in 1784.\r\nThe poet William Cowper refers to Katterfelto in _The Task_; he became\r\nnotorious for a long tour he undertook, exciting marvel by his conjuring\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATTOWITZ, a town in the Prussian province of Silesia, on the Rawa, near\r\nthe Russian frontier, 5 m. S.E. from Beuthen by rail. Pop. (1875),\r\n11,352; (1905), 35,772. There are large iron-works, foundries and\r\nmachine shops in the town, and near it zinc and anthracite mines. The\r\ngrowth of Kattowitz, like that of other places in the same district, has\r\nbeen very rapid, owing to the development of the mineral resources of\r\nthe neighbourhood. In 1815 it was a mere village, and became a town in\r\n1867. It has monuments to the emperors William I. and Frederick III.\r\n\r\n  See G. Hoffmann, _Geschichte der Stadt Kattowitz_ (Kattowitz, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATWA, or CUTWA, a town of British India, in Burdwan district, Bengal,\r\nsituated at the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Ajai rivers. Pop.\r\n(1901), 7220. It was the residence of many wealthy merchants, but its\r\ncommercial importance has declined as it is without railway\r\ncommunication and the difficulties of the river navigation have\r\nincreased. It was formerly regarded as the key to Murshidabad. The old\r\nfort, of which scarcely a vestige remains, is noted as the scene of the\r\ndefeat of the Mahrattas by Ali Vardi Khan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKATYDID, the name given to certain North American insects, belonging to\r\nthe family _Locustidae_, and related to the green or tree grasshoppers\r\nof England. As in other members of the family, the chirrup, alleged to\r\nresemble the words \"Katydid,\" is produced by the friction of a file on\r\nthe underside of the left forewing over a ridge on the upperside of the\r\nright. Several species, belonging mostly to the genera _Microcentonus_\r\nand _Cyrtophallus_, are known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAUFBEUREN, a town in the kingdom of Bavaria, on the Wertach, 55 m. S.W.\r\nof Munich by rail. Pop. (1905), 8955. Kaufbeuren is still surrounded by\r\nits medieval walls and presents a picturesque appearance. It has a\r\nhandsome town hall with fine paintings, an old tower (the Hexenturm, or\r\nwitches' tower), a museum and various educational institutions. The most\r\ninteresting of the ecclesiastical buildings is the chapel of St Blasius,\r\nwhich was restored in 1896. The chief industries are cotton spinning,\r\nweaving, bleaching, dyeing, printing, machine building and lithography,\r\nand there is an active trade in wine, beer and cheese. Kaufbeuren is\r\nsaid to have been founded in 842, and is first mentioned in chronicles\r\nof the year 1126. It appears to have become a free imperial city about\r\n1288, retaining the dignity until 1803, when it passed to Bavaria. It\r\nwas formerly a resort of pilgrims, and Roman coins have been found in\r\nthe vicinity.\r\n\r\n  See F. Stieve, _Die Reichsstadt Kaufbeuren und die bayrische\r\n  Restaurationspolitik_ (Munich, 1870); and Schroder, _Geschichte der\r\n  Stadt und Katholischen Pfarrei Kaufbeuren_ (Augsburg, 1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAUFFMANN, [MARIA ANNA] ANGELICA (1741-1807), the once popular artist\r\nand Royal Academician, was born at Coire in the Grisons, on the 30th of\r\nOctober 1741. Her father, John Josef Kauffmann, was a poor man and\r\nmediocre painter, but apparently very successful in teaching his\r\nprecocious daughter. She rapidly acquired several languages, read\r\nincessantly, and showed marked talents as a musician. Her greatest\r\nprogress, however, was in painting; and in her twelfth year she had\r\nbecome a notability, with bishops and nobles for her sitters. In 1754\r\nher father took her to Milan. Later visits to Italy of long duration\r\nappear to have succeeded this excursion; in 1763 she visited Rome,\r\nreturning to it again in 1764. From Rome she passed to Bologna and\r\nVenice, being everywhere feted and caressed, as much for her talents as\r\nfor her personal charms. Writing from Rome in August 1764 to his friend\r\nFranke, Winckelmann refers to her exceptional popularity. She was then\r\npainting his picture, a half-length, of which she also made an etching.\r\nShe spoke Italian as well as German, he says; and she also expressed\r\nherself with facility in French and English--one result of the\r\nlast-named accomplishment being that she painted all the English\r\nvisitors to the Eternal City. \"She may be styled beautiful,\" he adds,\r\n\"and in singing may vie with our best virtuosi.\" While at Venice, she\r\nwas induced by Lady Wentworth, the wife of the English ambassador to\r\naccompany her to London, where she appeared in 1766. One of her first\r\nworks was a portrait of Garrick, exhibited in the year of her arrival at\r\n\"Mr Moreing's great room in Maiden Lane.\" The rank of Lady Wentworth\r\nopened society to her, and she was everywhere well received, the royal\r\nfamily especially showing her great favour.\r\n\r\nHer firmest friend, however, was Sir Joshua Reynolds. In his pocket-book\r\nher name as \"Miss Angelica\" or \"Miss Angel\" appears frequently, and in\r\n1766 he painted her, a compliment which she returned by her \"Portrait of\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds,\" aetat. 46. Another instance of her intimacy with\r\nReynolds is to be found in the variation of Guercino's \"Et in Arcadia\r\nego\" produced by her at this date, a subject which Reynolds repeated a\r\nfew years later in his portrait of Mrs Bouverie and Mrs Crewe. When,\r\nabout November 1767, she was entrapped into a clandestine marriage with\r\nan adventurer who passed for a Swedish count (the Count de Horn)\r\nReynolds befriended her, and it was doubtless owing to his good offices\r\nthat her name is found among the signatories to the famous petition to\r\nthe king for the establishment of the Royal Academy. In its first\r\ncatalogue of 1769 she appears with \"R.A.\" after her name (an honour\r\nwhich she shared with another lady and compatriot, Mary Moser); and she\r\ncontributed the \"Interview of Hector and Andromache,\" and three other\r\nclassical compositions. From this time until 1782 she was an annual\r\nexhibitor, sending sometimes as many as seven pictures, generally\r\nclassic or allegorical subjects. One of the most notable of her\r\nperformances was the \"Leonardo expiring in the Arms of Francis the\r\nFirst,\" which belongs to the year 1778. In 1773 she was appointed by the\r\nAcademy with others to decorate St Paul's, and it was she who, with\r\nBiagio Rebecca, painted the Academy's old lecture room at Somerset\r\nHouse. It is probable that her popularity declined a little in\r\nconsequence of her unfortunate marriage; but in 1781, after her first\r\nhusband's death (she had been long separated from him), she married\r\nAntonio Zucchi (1728-1795), a Venetian artist then resident in England.\r\nShortly afterwards she retired to Rome, where she lived for twenty-five\r\nyears with much of her old prestige. In 1782 she lost her father; and in\r\n1795--the year in which she painted the picture of Lady Hamilton--her\r\nhusband. She continued at intervals to contribute to the Academy, her\r\nlast exhibit being in 1797. After this she produced little, and in\r\nNovember 1807 she died, being honoured by a splendid funeral under the\r\ndirection of Canova. The entire Academy of St Luke, with numerous\r\necclesiastics and virtuosi, followed her to her tomb in S. Andrea delle\r\nFratte, and, as at the burial of Raphael, two of her best pictures were\r\ncarried in procession.\r\n\r\n  The works of Angelica Kauffmann have not retained their reputation.\r\n  She had a certain gift of grace, and considerable skill in\r\n  composition. But her drawing is weak and faulty; her figures lack\r\n  variety and expression; and her men are masculine women. Her\r\n  colouring, however, is fairly enough defined by Waagen's term\r\n  \"cheerful.\" Rooms decorated by her brush are still to be seen in\r\n  various quarters. At Hampton Court is a portrait of the duchess of\r\n  Brunswick; in the National Portrait Gallery, a portrait of herself.\r\n  There are other pictures by her at Paris, at Dresden, in the Hermitage\r\n  at St Petersburg, and in the Alte Pinakothek at Munich. The Munich\r\n  example is another portrait of herself; and there is a third in the\r\n  Uffizi at Florence. A few of her works in private collections have\r\n  been exhibited among the \"Old Masters\" at Burlington House. But she is\r\n  perhaps best known by the numerous engravings from her designs by\r\n  Schiavonetti, Bartolozzi and others. Those by Bartolozzi especially\r\n  still find considerable favour with collectors. Her life was written\r\n  in 1810 by Giovanni de Rossi. It has also been used as the basis of a\r\n  romance by Leon de Wailly, 1838; and it prompted the charming novel\r\n  contributed by Mrs Richmond Ritchie to the _Cornhill Magazine_ in 1875\r\n  under the title of \"Miss Angel.\"     (A. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAUFMANN, CONSTANTINE PETROVICH (1818-1882), Russian general, was born\r\nat Maidani on the 3rd of March 1818. He entered the engineer branch in\r\n1838, served in the campaigns in the Caucasus, rose to be colonel, and\r\ncommanded the sappers and miners at the siege of Kars in 1855. On the\r\ncapitulation of Kars he was deputed to settle the terms with General Sir\r\nW. Fenwick Williams. In 1861 he became director-general of engineers at\r\nthe War Office, assisting General Milutin in the reorganization of the\r\narmy. Promoted lieut.-general in 1864, he was nominated\r\naide-de-camp-general and governor of the military conscription of Vilna.\r\nIn 1867 he became governor of Turkestan, and held the post until his\r\ndeath, making himself a name in the expansion of the empire in central\r\nAsia. He accomplished a successful campaign in 1868 against Bokhara,\r\ncapturing Samarkand and gradually subjugating the whole country. In 1873\r\nhe attacked Khiva, took the capital, and forced the khan to become a\r\nvassal of Russia. Then followed in 1875 the campaign against Khokand, in\r\nwhich Kaufmann defeated the khan, Nasr-ed-din. Khokand north of the\r\nSyrdaria was annexed to Russia, and the independence of the rest of the\r\ncountry became merely nominal. This rapid absorption of the khanates\r\nbrought Russia into close proximity to Afghanistan, and the reception of\r\nKaufmann's emissaries by the Amir was a main cause of the British war\r\nwith Afghanistan in 1878. Although Kaufmann was unable to induce his\r\ngovernment to support all his ambitious schemes of further conquest, he\r\nsent Skobeleff in 1880 and 1881 against the Akhal Tekkes, and was\r\narranging to add Merv to his annexations when he died suddenly at\r\nTashkend on the 15th of May 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAUKAUNA, a city of Outagamie county, Wisconsin, U.S.A., on the Fox\r\nriver 7 m. N.E. of Appleton and about 100 m. N. of Milwaukee. Pop.\r\n(1900), 5115, of whom 1044 were foreign-born (1905) 4991; (1910) 4717.\r\nKaukauna is served by the Chicago & North-Western railway (which has\r\ncar-shops here), by inter-urban electric railway lines connecting with\r\nother cities in the Fox river, valley, and by river steamboats. It has a\r\nCarnegie library, a hospital and manufactories of pulp, paper, lumber\r\nand woodenware. Dams on the Fox River furnish a good water-power. The\r\ncity owns its waterworks. A small settlement of Indian traders was made\r\nhere as early as 1820; in 1830 a Presbyterian mission was established,\r\nbut the growth of the place was slow, and the city was not chartered\r\nuntil 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAULBACH, WILHELM VON (1805-1874), German painter, was born in\r\nWestphalia on the 15th of October 1805. His father, who was poor,\r\ncombined painting with the goldsmith's trade, but means were found to\r\nplace Wilhelm, a youth of seventeen, in the art academy of Dusseldorf,\r\nthen becoming renowned under the directorship of Peter von Cornelius.\r\nYoung Kaulbach contended against hardships, even hunger. But his courage\r\nnever failed; and, uniting genius with industry, he was ere long\r\nforemost among the young national party which sought to revive the arts\r\nof Germany. The ambitious work by which Louis I. sought to transform\r\nMunich into a German Athens afforded the young painter an appropriate\r\nsphere. Cornelius had been commissioned to execute the enormous frescoes\r\nin the Glyptothek, and his custom was in the winters, with the aid of\r\nKaulbach and others, to complete the cartoons at Dusseldorf, and in the\r\nsummers, accompanied by his best scholars, to carry out the designs in\r\ncolour on the museum walls in Munich. But in 1824 Cornelius became\r\ndirector of the Bavarian academy. Kaulbach, not yet twenty, followed,\r\ntook up his permanent residence in Munich, laboured hard on the public\r\nworks, executed independent commissions, and in 1849, when Cornelius\r\nleft for Berlin, succeeded to the directorship of the academy, an office\r\nwhich he held till his death on the 7th of April 1874. His son Hermann\r\n(1846-1909) also became a distinguished painter.\r\n\r\nKaulbach matured, after the example of the masters of the Middle Ages,\r\nthe practice of mural or monumental decoration; he once more conjoined\r\npainting with architecture, and displayed a creative fertility and\r\nreadiness of resource scarcely found since the era of Raphael and\r\nMichelangelo. Early in the series of his multitudinous works came the\r\nfamous Narrenhaus, the appalling memories of a certain madhouse near\r\nDusseldorf; the composition all the more deserves mention for points of\r\ncontact with Hogarth. Somewhat to the same category belong the\r\nillustrations to _Reineke Fuchs_. These, together with occasional\r\nfigures or passages in complex pictorial dramas, show how dominant and\r\nirrepressible were the artist's sense of satire and enjoyment of fun;\r\ncharacter in its breadth and sharpness is depicted with keenest relish,\r\nand at times the sardonic smile bursts into the loudest laugh. Thus\r\noccasionally the grotesque degenerates into the vulgar, the grand into\r\nthe ridiculous, as in the satire on \"the Pigtail Age\" in a fresco\r\noutside the New Pinakothek. Yet these exceptional extravagances came not\r\nof weakness but from excess of power. Kaulbach tried hard to become\r\nGrecian and Italian; but he never reached Phidias or Raphael; in short\r\nthe blood of Durer, Holbein and Martin Schongauer ran strong in his\r\nveins. The art products in Munich during the middle of the 19th century\r\nwere of a quantity to preclude first-rate quality, and Kaulbach\r\ncontracted a fatal facility in covering wall and canvas by the acre. He\r\npainted in the Hofgarten, the Odeon, the Palace and on the external\r\nwalls of the New Pinakothek. His perspicuous and showy manner also\r\ngained him abundant occupation as a book illustrator: in the pages of\r\nthe poets his fancy revelled; he was glad to take inspiration from\r\nWieland, Goethe, even Klopstock; among his engraved designs are the\r\nShakespeare gallery, the Goethe gallery and a folio edition of the\r\nGospels. With regard to these examples of \"the Munich school,\" it was\r\nasserted that Kaulbach had been unfortunate alike in having found\r\nCornelius for a master and King Louis for a patron, that he attempted\r\n\"subjects far beyond him, believing that his admiration for them was\r\nthe same as inspiration\"; and supplied the lack of real imagination by\r\n\"a compound of intellect and fancy.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless in such compositions as the Destruction of Jerusalem and\r\nthe Battle of the Huns Kaulbach shows creative imagination. As a\r\ndramatic poet he tells the story, depicts character, seizes on action\r\nand situation, and thus as it were takes the spectator by storm. The\r\nmanner may be occasionally noisy and ranting, but the effect after its\r\nkind is tremendous. The cartoon, which, as usual in modern German art,\r\nis superior to the ultimate picture, was executed in the artist's prime\r\nat the age of thirty. At this period, as here seen, the knowledge was\r\nlittle short of absolute; subtle is the sense of beauty; playful,\r\ndelicate, firm the touch; the whole treatment artistic.\r\n\r\nTen or more years were devoted to what the Germans term a \"cyclus\"--a\r\nseries of pictures depicting the Tower of Babel, the Age of Homer, the\r\nDestruction of Jerusalem, the Battle of the Huns, the Crusades and the\r\nReformation. These major tableaux, severally 30 ft. long, and each\r\ncomprising over one hundred figures above life-size, are surrounded by\r\nminor compositions making more than twenty in all. The idea is to\r\ncongregate around the world's historic dramas the prime agents of\r\ncivilization; thus here are assembled allegoric figures of Architecture\r\nand other arts, of Science and other kingdoms of knowledge, together\r\nwith lawgivers from the time of Moses, not forgetting Frederick the\r\nGreat. The chosen situation for this imposing didactic and theatric\r\ndisplay is the Treppenhaus or grand staircase in the new museum, Berlin;\r\nthe surface is a granulated, absorbent wall, specially prepared; the\r\ntechnical method is that known as \"water-glass,\" or \"liquid flint,\" the\r\ninfusion of silica securing permanence. The same medium was adopted in\r\nthe later wall-pictures in the Houses of Parliament, Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe painter's last period brings no new departure; his ultimate works\r\nstand conspicuous by exaggerations of early characteristics. The series\r\nof designs illustrative of Goethe, which had an immense success, were\r\nmelodramatic and pandered to popular taste. The vast canvas, more than\r\n30 ft. long, the Sea Fight at Salamis, painted for the Maximilianeum,\r\nMunich, evinces wonted imagination and facility in composition; the\r\nhandling also retains its largeness and vigour; but in this astounding\r\nscenic uproar moderation and the simplicity of nature are thrown to the\r\nwinds, and the whole atmosphere is hot and feverish.\r\n\r\n  Kaulbach's was a beauty-loving art. He is not supreme as a colourist;\r\n  he belongs in fact to a school that holds colour in subordination; but\r\n  he laid, in common with the great masters, the sure foundation of his\r\n  art in form and composition. Indeed, the science of composition has\r\n  seldom if ever been so clearly understood or worked out with equal\r\n  complexity and exactitude; the constituent lines, the relation of the\r\n  parts to the whole, are brought into absolute agreement; in modern\r\n  Germany painting and music have trodden parallel paths, and Kaulbach\r\n  is musical in the melody and harmony of his compositions. His\r\n  narrative too is lucid, and moves as a stately march or royal triumph;\r\n  the sequence of the figures is unbroken; the arrangement of the groups\r\n  accords with even literary form; the picture falls into incident,\r\n  episode, dialogue, action, plot, as a drama. The style is eclectic; in\r\n  the Age of Homer the types and the treatment are derived from Greek\r\n  marbles and vases; then in the Tower of Babel the severity of the\r\n  antique gives place to the suavity of the Italian renaissance; while\r\n  in the Crusades the composition is let loose into modern romanticism,\r\n  and so the manner descends into the midst of the 19th century. And yet\r\n  this scholastically compounded art is so nicely adjusted and smoothly\r\n  blended that it casts off all incongruity and becomes homogeneous as\r\n  the issue of one mind. But a fickle public craved for change; and so\r\n  the great master in later years waned in favour, and had to witness,\r\n  not without inquietude, the rise of an opposing party of naturalism\r\n  and realism.     (J. B. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAUNITZ-RIETBURG, WENZEL ANTON, PRINCE VON (1711-1794), Austrian\r\nchancellor and diplomatist, was born at Vienna on the 2nd of February\r\n1711. His father, Max Ulrich, was the third count of Kaunitz, and\r\nmarried an heiress, Maria Ernestine Franziska von Rietburg. The family\r\nwas ancient, and was believed to have been of Slavonic origin in\r\nMoravia. Wenzel Anton, being a second son, was designed for the church,\r\nbut on the death of his elder brother he was trained for the law and for\r\ndiplomacy, at Vienna, Leipzig and Leiden, and by travel. His family had\r\nserved the Habsburgs with some distinction, and Kaunitz had no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining employment. In 1735 he was a _Reichshofrath_.\r\nWhen the Emperor Charles VI. died in 1740, he is said to have hesitated\r\nbefore deciding to support Maria Theresa. If so, his hesitation did not\r\nlast long, and left no trace on his loyalty. From 1742 to 1744 he was\r\nminister at Turin, and in the latter year was sent as minister with the\r\nArchduke Charles of Lorraine, the governor of Belgium. He was therefore\r\nan eye-witness of the campaigns in which Marshal Saxe overran Belgium.\r\nAt this time he was extremely discouraged, and sought for his recall.\r\nBut he had earned the approval of Maria Theresa, who sent him as\r\nrepresentative of Austria to the peace congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in\r\n1748. His tenacity and dexterity established his reputation as a\r\ndiplomatist. He confirmed his hold on the regard and confidence of the\r\nempress by the line he took after the conclusion of the peace. In 1749\r\nMaria Theresa appealed to all her counsellors for advice as to the\r\npolicy Austria ought to pursue in view of the changed conditions\r\nproduced by the rise of Prussia. The great majority of them, including\r\nher husband Francis I., were of opinion that the old alliance with the\r\nsea Powers, England and Holland, should be maintained. Kaunitz, either\r\nbecause he was really persuaded that the old policy must be given up, or\r\nbecause he saw that the dominating idea in the mind of Maria Theresa was\r\nthe recovery of Silesia, gave it as his opinion that Frederick was now\r\nthe \"most wicked and dangerous enemy of Austria,\" that it was hopeless\r\nto expect the support of Protestant nations against him, and that the\r\nonly way of recovering Silesia was by an alliance with Russia and\r\nFrance. The empress eagerly accepted views which were already her own,\r\nand entrusted the adviser with the execution of his own plans. An\r\nambassador to France from 1750 to 1752, and after 1753 as \"house, court\r\nand state chancellor,\" Kaunitz laboured successfully to bring about the\r\nalliance which led to the Seven Years' War. It was considered a great\r\nfeat of diplomacy, and established Kaunitz as the recognized master of\r\nthe art. His triumph was won in spite of personal defects and\r\nabsurdities which would have ruined most men. Kaunitz had manias rarely\r\nfound in company with absolute sanity. He would not hear of death, nor\r\napproach a sick man. He refused to visit his dying master Joseph II. for\r\ntwo whole years. He would not breathe fresh air. On the warmest summer\r\nday he kept a handkerchief over his mouth when out of doors, and his\r\nonly exercise was riding under glass, which he did every morning for\r\nexactly the same number of minutes. He relaxed from his work in the\r\ncompany of a small dependent society of sycophants and buffoons. He was\r\nconsumed by a solemn, garrulous and pedantic vanity. When in 1770 he met\r\nFrederick the Great at Mahrisch-Neustadt, he came with a summary of\r\npolitical principles, which he called a catechism, in his pocket, and\r\nassured the king that he must be allowed to speak without interruption.\r\nWhen Frederick, whose interest it was to humour him, promised to listen\r\nquietly, Kaunitz rolled his mind out for two hours, and went away with\r\nthe firm conviction that he had at last enlightened the inferior\r\nintellect of the king of Prussia as to what politics really were. Within\r\na very short time Frederick had completely deceived and out-manoeuvred\r\nhim. With all his pomposity and conceit, Kaunitz was astute, he was\r\nlaborious and orderly; when his advice was not taken he would carry out\r\nthe wishes of his masters, while no defeat ever damped his pertinacity.\r\n\r\nTo tell his history from 1750 till his retirement in 1792 would be to\r\ntell part of the internal history of Austria, and all the international\r\npolitics of eastern and central Europe. His governing principle was to\r\nforward the interests of \"the august house of Austria,\" a phrase\r\nsometimes repeated at every few lines of his despatches. In internal\r\naffairs he in 1758 recommended, and helped to promote, a simplification\r\nof the confused and subdivided Austrian administration. But his main\r\nconcern was always with diplomacy and foreign policy. Here he strove\r\nwith untiring energy, and no small measure of success, to extend the\r\nAustrian dominions. After the Seven Years' War he endeavoured to avoid\r\ngreat risks, and sought to secure his ends by alliances, exchanges and\r\nclaims professing to have a legal basis, and justified at enormous\r\nlength by arguments both pedantic and hypocritical. The French\r\nRevolution had begun to alter all the relations of the Powers before his\r\nretirement. He never understood its full meaning. Yet the circular\r\ndespatch which he addressed to the ambassadors of the emperor on the\r\n17th of July 1794 contains the first outlines of Metternich's policy of\r\n\"legitimacy,\" and the first proposal for the combined action of the\r\npowers, based on the full recognition of one another's rights, to defend\r\nthemselves against subversive principles. Kaunitz died at his house, the\r\nGarten Palast, near Vienna, on the 27th of June 1794. He married on the\r\n6th of May 1736, Maria Ernestine von Starhemberg, who died on the 6th of\r\nSeptember 1754. Four sons were born of the marriage.\r\n\r\n  See Hormayr, _Oesterreichischer Plutarch_ (Vienna, 1823), for a\r\n  biographical sketch based on personal knowledge.

Beer, _Joseph II., Leopold II. und Kaunitz_ (Vienna, 1873).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAUP, JOHANN JAKOB (1803-1873), German naturalist, was born at Darmstadt\r\non the 10th of April 1803. After studying at Gottingen and Heidelberg he\r\nspent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to\r\nthe amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant\r\nin the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829\r\nhe published _Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europaischen\r\nThierwelt_, in which he regarded the animal world as developed from\r\nlower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the\r\nbeasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful\r\nindiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's _Origin of Species_ he\r\ndeclared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for\r\npalaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his\r\n_Beitrage zur naheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Saugethiere_\r\n(1855-1862). He also wrote _Classification der Saugethiere und Vogel_\r\n(1844), and, with H. G. Brown (1800-1862) of Heidelberg, _Die\r\nGavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias_ (1842-1844). He died at Darmstadt on\r\nthe 4th of July 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAURI PINE, in botany, _Agathis australis_, a conifer native of New\r\nZealand where it is abundant in forests in the North Island between the\r\nNorth Cape and 38 deg. south latitude. The forests are rapidly\r\ndisappearing owing to use as timber and to destruction by fires. It is a\r\ntall resiniferous tree, usually ranging from 80 to 100 ft. in height,\r\nwith a trunk 4 to 10 ft. in diameter, but reaching 150 ft., with a\r\ndiameter of 15 to 22 ft.; it has a straight columnar trunk and a rounded\r\nbushy head. The thick resiniferous bark falls off in large flat flakes.\r\nThe leaves, which persist for several years, are very thick and\r\nleathery; on young trees they are lance-shaped 2 to 4 in. long and 1/4\r\nto 1/2 in. broad, becoming on mature trees linear-oblong or\r\nobovate-oblong and 3/4 to 1(1/2) in. long. The ripe cones are almost\r\nspherical, erect, and 2 to 3 in. in diameter; the broad, flat, rather\r\nthin cone-scales fall from the axis when ripe. Each scale bears a single\r\ncompressed seed with a membranous wing. The timber is remarkable for its\r\nstrength, durability and the ease with which it is worked. The resin,\r\nkauri-gum, is an amber-like deposit dug in large quantities from the\r\nsites of previous forests, in lumps generally varying in size from that\r\nof a hen's egg to that of a man's head. The colour is of a rich brown or\r\namber yellow, or it may be almost colourless and translucent. It is of\r\nvalue for varnish-making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAVA (CAVA or AVA), an intoxicating, but non-alcoholic beverage,\r\nproduced principally in the islands of the South Pacific, from the roots\r\nor leaves of a variety of the pepper plant (_Piper methysticum_). The\r\nmethod of preparation is somewhat peculiar. The roots or leaves are\r\nfirst chewed by young girls or boys, care being taken that only those\r\npossessing sound teeth and excellent general health shall take part in\r\nthis operation. The chewed material is then placed in a bowl, and water\r\nor coco-nut milk is poured over it, the whole is well stirred, and\r\nsubsequently the woody matter is removed by an ingenious but simple\r\nmechanical manipulation. The resulting liquid, which has a muddy or\r\n_cafe-au-lait_ appearance, or is of a greenish hue if made from leaves,\r\nis now ready for consumption. The taste of the liquid is at first sweet,\r\nand then pungent and acrid. The usual dose corresponds to about two\r\nmouthfuls of the root. Intoxication (but this apparently only applies to\r\nthose not inured to the use of the liquor) follows in about twenty\r\nminutes. The drunkenness produced by kava is of a melancholy, silent and\r\ndrowsy character. Excessive drinking is said to lead to skin and other\r\ndiseases, but _per contra_ many medicinal virtues are ascribed to the\r\npreparation. There appears to be little doubt that the active principle\r\nin this beverage is a poison of an alkaloidal nature. It seems likely\r\nthat this substance is not present as such (i.e. as a free alkaloid) in\r\nthe plant, but that it exists in the form of a glucoside, and that by\r\nthe process of chewing this glucoside is split up by one of the ferments\r\nin the saliva into the free alkaloid and sugar.\r\n\r\n  See _Pharm.

It\r\nwas borne by two kings of the Sassanid dynasty.\r\n\r\n(1) KAVADH I., son of Peroz, crowned by the nobles in 488 in place of\r\nhis uncle Balash, who was deposed and blinded. At this time the empire\r\nwas utterly disorganized by the invasion of the Ephthalites or White\r\nHuns from the east. After one of their victories against Peroz, Kavadh\r\nhad been a hostage among them during two years, pending the payment of a\r\nheavy ransom. In 484 Peroz had been defeated and slain with his whole\r\narmy. Balash was not able to restore the royal authority. The hopes of\r\nthe magnates and high priests that Kavadh would suit their purpose were\r\nsoon disappointed. Kavadh gave his support to the communistic sect\r\nfounded by Mazdak, son of Bamdad, who demanded that the rich should\r\ndivide their wives and their wealth with the poor. His intention\r\nevidently was, by adopting the doctrine of the Mazdakites, to break the\r\ninfluence of the magnates. But in 496 he was deposed and incarcerated in\r\nthe \"Castle of Oblivion (Lethe)\" in Susiana, and his brother Jamasp\r\n(Zamaspes) was raised to the throne. Kavadh, however, escaped and found\r\nrefuge with the Ephthalites, whose king gave him his daughter in\r\nmarriage and aided him to return to Persia. In 499 he became king again\r\nand punished his opponents. He had to pay a tribute to the Ephthalites\r\nand applied for subsidies to Rome, which had before supported the\r\nPersians. But now the emperor Anastasius refused subsidies, expecting\r\nthat the two rival powers of the East would exhaust one another in war.\r\nAt the same time he intervened in the affairs of the Persian part of\r\nArmenia. So Kavadh joined the Ephthalites and began war against the\r\nRomans. In 502 he took Theodosiopolis in Armenia, in 503 Amida\r\n(Diarbekr) on the Tigris. In 505 an invasion of Armenia by the western\r\nHuns from the Caucasus led to an armistice, during which the Romans paid\r\nsubsidies to the Persians for the maintenance of the fortifications on\r\nthe Caucasus. When Justin I. (518-527) came to the throne the conflict\r\nbegan anew. The Persian vassal, Mondhir of Hira, laid waste Mesopotamia\r\nand slaughtered the monks and nuns. In 531 Belisarius was beaten at\r\nCallinicum. Shortly afterwards Kavadh died, at the age of eighty-two, in\r\nSeptember 531. During his last years his favourite son Chosroes had had\r\ngreat influence over him and had been proclaimed successor. He also\r\ninduced Kavadh to break with the Mazdakites, whose doctrine had spread\r\nwidely and caused great social confusion throughout Persia. In 529 they\r\nwere refuted in a theological discussion held before the throne of the\r\nking by the orthodox Magians, and were slaughtered and persecuted\r\neverywhere; Mazdak himself was hanged. Kavadh evidently was, as\r\nProcopius (_Pers._ i. 6) calls him, an unusually clear-sighted and\r\nenergetic ruler. Although he could not free himself from the yoke of the\r\nEphthalites, he succeeded in restoring order in the interior and fought\r\nwith success against the Romans. He built some towns which were named\r\nafter him, and began to regulate the taxation.\r\n\r\n(2) KAVADH II. SHEROE (Siroes), son of Chosroes II., was raised to the\r\nthrone in opposition to his father in February 628, after the great\r\nvictories of the emperor Heraclius. He put his father and eighteen\r\nbrothers to death, began negotiations with Heraclius, but died after a\r\nreign of a few months.     (Ed. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAVALA, or CAVALLA, a walled town and seaport of European Turkey in the\r\nvilayet of Salonica, on the Bay of Kavala, an inlet of the Aegean Sea.\r\nPop. (1905), about 5000. Kavala is built on a promontory stretching\r\nsouth into the bay, and opposite the island of Thasos. There is a\r\nharbour on each side of the promontory. The resident population is\r\nincreased in summer by an influx of peasantry, of whom during the season\r\n5000 to 6000 are employed in curing tobacco and preparing it for export.\r\nThe finest Turkish tobacco is grown in the district, and shipped to all\r\nparts of Europe and America, to the annual value of about L1,250,000.\r\nMehemet Ali was born here in 1769, and founded a Turkish school which\r\nstill exists. His birthplace, an unpretentious little house in one of\r\nthe tortuous older streets, can be distinguished by the tablet which the\r\nmunicipal authorities have affixed to its front wall. Numerous Roman\r\nremains have been found in the neighbourhood, of which the chief is the\r\nlarge aqueduct on two tiers of arches which still serves to supply the\r\ntown and dilapidated citadel with water from Mount Pangeus.\r\n\r\n  Kavala has been identified with Neapolis, at which St Paul landed on\r\n  his way from Samothrace to Philippi (Acts xvi. 11). Neapolis was the\r\n  port of Philippi, as Kavala now is of Seres; in the bay on which it\r\n  stands the fleet of Brutus and Cassius was stationed during the battle\r\n  of Philippi. Some authorities identify Neapolis with Datum ([Greek:\r\n  Daton]), mentioned by Herodotus as famous for its gold mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAVANAGH, ARTHUR MACMORROUGH (1831-1889), Irish politician, son of\r\nThomas Kavanagh, M.P., who traced his descent to the ancient kings of\r\nLeinster, was born in Co. Carlow, Ireland, on the 25th of March 1831. He\r\nhad only the rudiments of arms and legs, but in spite of these physical\r\ndefects had a remarkable career. He learnt to ride in the most fearless\r\nway, strapped to a special saddle, and managing the horse with the\r\nstumps of his arms; and also fished, shot, drew and wrote, various\r\nmechanical contrivances being devised to supplement his limited physical\r\ncapacities. He travelled extensively in Egypt, Asia Minor, Persia and\r\nIndia between 1846 and 1853, and after succeeding to the family estates\r\nin the latter year, he married in 1855 his cousin, Miss Frances Mary\r\nLeathley. Assisted by his wife, he was a most philanthropic landlord,\r\nand was an active county magistrate and chairman of the board of\r\nguardians. A Conservative and a Protestant, he sat in Parliament for Co.\r\nWexford from 1866 to 1868, and for Co. Carlow from 1868 to 1880. He was\r\nopposed to the disestablishment of the Irish Church, but supported the\r\nLand Act of 1870, and sat on the Bessborough Commission. In 1886 he was\r\nmade a member of the Privy Council in Ireland. He died of pneumonia on\r\nthe 25th of December 1889, in London. It is supposed that his\r\nextraordinary career suggested the idea of \"Lucas Malet's\" novel, _The\r\nHistory of Sir Richard Calmady_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAVANAGH, JULIA (1824-1877), British novelist, was born at Thurles in\r\nTipperary, Ireland, in 1824. She was the daughter of Morgan Peter\r\nKavanagh (d. 1874), author of various worthless philological works and\r\nsome poems. Julia spent several years of her early life with her parents\r\nin Normandy, laying there the foundation of a mastery of the French\r\nlanguage and insight into French modes of thought, which was perfected\r\nby her later frequent and long residences in France. Miss Kavanagh's\r\nliterary career began with her arrival in London about 1844, and her\r\nuneventful life affords few incidents to the biographer. Her first book\r\nwas _Three Paths_ (1847), a story for the young; but her first work to\r\nattract notice was _Madeleine, a Tale of Auvergne_ (1848). Other books\r\nfollowed: _A Summer and Winter in the Two Sicilies_ (1858); _French\r\nWomen of Letters_ (1862); _English Women of Letters_ (1862); _Woman in\r\nFrance during the 18th Century_ (1850); and _Women of Christianity_\r\n(1852). The scenes of her stories are almost always laid in France, and\r\nshe handles her French themes with fidelity and skill. Her style is\r\nsimple and pleasing rather than striking; and her characters are\r\ninteresting without being strongly individualized. Her most popular\r\nnovels were perhaps _Adele_ (1857), _Queen Mab_ (1863), and _John\r\nDorrien_ (1875). On the outbreak of the Franco-German War Julia Kavanagh\r\nremoved with her mother from Paris to Rouen. She died at Nice on the\r\n28th of October 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAVASS, or CAVASS (adapted from the Turkish _qawwas_, a bow-maker;\r\nArabic _qaws_, a bow), a Turkish name for an armed police-officer; also\r\nfor a courier such as it is usual to engage when travelling in Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAVIRONDO, a people of British East Africa, who dwell in the valley of\r\nthe Nzoia River, on the western slopes of Mount Elgon, and along the\r\nnorth-east coast of Victoria Nyanza. Kavirondo is the general name of\r\ntwo distinct groups of tribes, one Bantu and the other Nilotic. Both\r\ngroups are immigrants, the Bantu from the south, the Nilotic from the\r\nnorth. The Bantu appear to have been the first comers. The Nilotic\r\ntribes, probably an offshoot of the Acholi (q.v.), appear to have\r\ncrossed the lake to reach their present home, the country around\r\nKavirondo Gulf. Of the two groups the Bantu now occupy a more northerly\r\nposition than their neighbours, and \"are practically the most northerly\r\nrepresentatives of that race\" (Hobley). Their further progress north was\r\nstopped by the southward movement of the Nilotic tribes, while the\r\nNilotic Kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an\r\nirruption of Elgumi people from the east. The Elgumi are themselves\r\nprobably of Nilotic origin. Both groups of Kavirondo are physically\r\nfine, the Nilotic stock appearing more virile than the Bantu. The Bantu\r\nKavirondo are divided into three principal types--the Awa-Rimi, the\r\nAwa-Ware and the Awa-Kisii. By the Nilotic Kavirondo their Bantu\r\nneighbours are known as Ja-Mwa. The generic name for the Nilotic tribes\r\nis Ja-Luo. The Bantu Kavirondo call them Awa-Nyoro. The two groups have\r\nmany characteristics in common. A characteristic feature of the people\r\nis their nakedness. Among the Nilotic Kavirondo married men who are\r\nfathers wear a small piece of goat-skin, which though practically\r\nuseless as a covering must be worn according to tribal etiquette. Even\r\namong men who have adopted European clothing this goat-skin must still\r\nbe worn underneath. Contact with whites has led to the adoption of\r\nEuropean clothing by numbers of the men, but the women, more\r\nconservative, prefer nudity or the scanty covering which they wore\r\nbefore the advent of Europeans. Among the Bantu Kavirondo married women\r\nwear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana\r\nfibre suspended from a girdle behind, this tassel having at a distance\r\nthe appearance of a tail. Hence the report of early travellers as to a\r\ntailed race in Africa. The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail, but\r\ndispense with the fringe in front. For \"dandy\" they wear a goat-skin\r\nslung over the shoulders. Some of the Bantu tribes practise\r\ncircumcision, the Nilotic tribes do not. Patterns are tattooed on chest\r\nand stomach for ornament. Men, even husbands, are forbidden to touch the\r\nwomen's tails, which must be worn even should any other clothing be\r\nwrapped round the body. The Kavirondo are noted for their independent\r\nand pugnacious nature, their honesty and their sexual morality, traits\r\nparticularly marked among the Bantu tribes. There are more women than\r\nmen, and thus the Kavirondo are naturally inclined towards polygamy.\r\nAmong the Bantu tribes a man has the refusal of all the younger sisters\r\nof his wife as they attain puberty. Practically no woman lives unmarried\r\nall her life, for if no suitor seeks her, she singles out a man and\r\noffers herself to him at a \"reduced price,\" an offer usually accepted,\r\nas the women are excellent agricultural labourers. The Nilotic Kavirondo\r\nincline to exogamy, endeavouring always to marry outside their clan.\r\nGirls are betrothed at six or seven, and the husband-elect continually\r\nmakes small presents to his father-in-law-elect till the bride reaches\r\nwomanhood. It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin\r\non her wedding day. She is sent back to her parents, who have to return\r\nthe marriage price, and pay a fine. The wife's adultery was formerly\r\npunished with death, and the capital penalty was also inflicted on young\r\nmen and girls guilty of unchastity. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the usual\r\nminimum price for a wife is forty hoes, twenty goats and one cow, paid\r\nin instalments. The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six\r\ncows; the husband-elect can claim his bride when he has made half\r\npayment. If a woman dies without bearing children, the amount of her\r\npurchase is returnable by her father, unless the widower consents to\r\nreplace her by another sister. The women are prolific and the birth of\r\ntwins is common. This is considered a lucky event, and is celebrated by\r\nfeasting and dances. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the mother of twins must\r\nremain in her hut for seven days. Among the Nilotic Kavirondo the\r\nparents and the infants must stay in the hut for a whole month. If a\r\nBantu mother has lost two children in succession the next child born is\r\ntaken out at dawn and placed on the road, where it is left till a\r\nneighbour, usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose,\r\npicks it up. She takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return. A\r\nsomewhat similar custom prevails among the Nilotic tribes. Names are not\r\nmale and female, and a daughter often bears her father's name.\r\n\r\n  The Kavirondo bury their dead. Among one of the Bantu tribes, the\r\n  Awa-Kisesa, a chief is buried in the floor of his own hut in a sitting\r\n  position, but at such a depth that the head protrudes. Over the head\r\n  an earthenware pot is placed, and his principal wives have to remain\r\n  in the hut till the flesh is eaten by ants or decomposes, when the\r\n  skull is removed and buried close to the hut. Later the skeleton is\r\n  unearthed, and reburied with much ceremony in the sacred burial place\r\n  of the tribe. Married women of the Bantu tribes are buried in their\r\n  hut lying on their right side with legs doubled up, the hut being then\r\n  deserted. Among the Nilotic tribes the grave is dug beneath the\r\n  verandah of the hut. Men of the Bantu tribes are buried in an open\r\n  space in the midst of their huts; in the Nilotic tribes, if the first\r\n  wife of the deceased be alive he is buried in her hut, if not, beneath\r\n  the verandah of the hut in which he died. A child is buried near the\r\n  door of its mother's hut. A sign of mourning is a cord of banana fibre\r\n  worn round the neck and waist. A chief chooses, sometimes years before\r\n  his death, one of his sons to succeed him, often giving a brass\r\n  bracelet as insignia. A man's property is divided equally among his\r\n  children.\r\n\r\n  The Kavirondo are essentially an agricultural people: both men and\r\n  women work in the fields with large iron hoes. In addition to sorghum,\r\n  _Eleusine_ and maize, tobacco and hemp are both cultivated and smoked.\r\n  Both sexes smoke, but the use of hemp is restricted to men and\r\n  unmarried women, as it is thought to injure child-bearing women. Hemp\r\n  is smoked in a hubble-bubble. The Kavirondo cultivate sesamum and make\r\n  an oil from its seeds which they burn in little clay lamps. These\r\n  lamps are of the ancient saucer type, the pattern being, in Hobley's\r\n  opinion, introduced into the country by the coast people. While some\r\n  tribes live in isolated huts, those in the north have strongly walled\r\n  villages. The walls are of mud and formerly, among the Nilotic tribes,\r\n  occasionally of stone. Since the advent of the British the security of\r\n  the country has induced the Kavirondo to let the walls fall into\r\n  disrepair. Their huts are circular with conical thatched roof, and\r\n  fairly broad verandah all round. A portion of the hut is partitioned\r\n  off as a sleeping-place for goats, and the fowls sleep indoors in a\r\n  large basket. Skins form the only bedsteads. In each hut are two\r\n  fireplaces, about which a rigid etiquette prevails. Strangers or\r\n  distant relatives are not allowed to pass beyond the first, which is\r\n  near the door, and is used for cooking. At the second, which is nearly\r\n  in the middle of the hut, sit the hut owner, his wives, children,\r\n  brothers and sisters. Around this fireplace the family sleep. Cooking\r\n  pots, water pots and earthenware grain jars are the only other\r\n  furniture. The food is served in small baskets. Every full grown man\r\n  has a hut to himself, and one for each wife. The huts of the Masaba\r\n  Kavirondo of west Elgon have the apex of the roof surmounted by a\r\n  carved pole which Sir H. H. Johnston says is obviously a phallus.\r\n  Among the Bantu Kavirondo a father does not eat with his sons, nor do\r\n  brothers eat together. Among the Nilotic tribes father and sons eat\r\n  together, usually in a separate hut with open sides. Women eat apart\r\n  and only after the men have finished. The Kavirondo keep cattle,\r\n  sheep, goats, fowls and a few dogs. Women do not eat sheep, fowls or\r\n  eggs, and are not allowed to drink milk except when mixed with other\r\n  things. The flesh of the wild cat and leopard is esteemed by most of\r\n  the tribes. From _Eleusine_ a beer is made. The Kavirondo are plucky\r\n  hunters, capturing the hippopotamus with ropes and traps, and\r\n  attacking with spears the largest elephants. Fish, of which they are\r\n  very fond, are caught by line and rod or in traps. Bee-keeping is\r\n  common, and where trees are scarce the hives are placed on the roof of\r\n  the hut. Among the Bantu Kavirondo goats and sheep are suffocated, the\r\n  snout being held until the animal dies. Though a peaceful people the\r\n  Kavirondo fight well. Their weapons are spears with rather long flat\r\n  blades without blood-courses, and broad-bladed swords. Some use\r\n  slings, and most carry shields. Bows and arrows are also used;\r\n  firearms are however displacing other weapons. Kavirondo warfare was\r\n  mainly defensive and intertribal, this last a form of vendetta. When a\r\n  man had killed his enemy in battle he shaved his head on his return\r\n  and he was rubbed with \"medicine\" (generally goat's dung), to defend\r\n  him from the spirit of the dead man. This custom the Awa-Wanga\r\n  abandoned when they obtained firearms. The young warriors were made to\r\n  stab the bodies of their slain enemies. Kavirondo industries are\r\n  salt-making, effected by burning reeds and water-plants and passing\r\n  water through the ashes; the smelting of iron ore (confined to the\r\n  Bantu tribes); pottery and basket-work.\r\n\r\n  The Kavirondo have many tribes, divided, Sir H. H. Johnston suspects,\r\n  totemically. Their religion appears to be a vague ancestor-worship,\r\n  but the northern tribes have two gods, Awafwa and Ishishemi, the\r\n  spirits of good and evil. To the former cattle and goats are\r\n  sacrificed. The Kavirondo have great faith in divination from the\r\n  entrails of a sheep. Nearly everybody and everything is to the\r\n  Kavirondo ominous of good or evil. They have few myths or traditions;\r\n  the ant-bear is the chief figure in their beast-legends. They believe\r\n  in witchcraft and practise trial by ordeal. As a race the Kavirondo\r\n  are on the increase. This is due to their fecundity and morality.\r\n  Those who live in the low-lying lands suffer from a mild malaria,\r\n  while abroad they are subject to dysentery and pneumonia. Epidemics of\r\n  small-pox have occurred. Native medicine is of the simplest. They\r\n  dress wounds with butter and leaves, and for inflammation of the lungs\r\n  or pleurisy pierce a hole in the chest. There are no\r\n  medicine-men--the women are the doctors. Certain of the incisor teeth\r\n  are pulled out. If a man retains these he will, it is thought, be\r\n  killed in warfare. Among certain tribes the women also have incisor\r\n  teeth extracted, otherwise misfortune would befall their husbands. For\r\n  the same reason the wife scars the skin of her forehead or stomach. A\r\n  Kavirondo husband, before starting on a perilous journey, cuts scars\r\n  on his wife's body to ensure him good luck. Of dances the Kavirondo\r\n  have four--the birth dance, the death dance, that at initiation and\r\n  one of a propitiatory kind in seasons of drought. Their music is\r\n  plaintive and sometimes pretty, produced by a large lyre-shaped\r\n  instrument. They use also various drums.\r\n\r\n  The Ja-Luo women use for ear ornaments small beads attached to pieces\r\n  of brass. Like the aggry beads of West Africa these beads are not of\r\n  local manufacture nor of recent introduction. They are ancient, in\r\n  colour generally blue, occasionally yellow or green, and are picked up\r\n  in certain districts after heavy rain. By the natives they are\r\n  supposed to come down with the rain. They are identical in shape and\r\n  colour with ancient Egyptian beads and other beads obtained from\r\n  ancient cities in Baluchistan.\r\n\r\n  See C. W.

Their early home was in\r\nMissouri, whence they were driven to Kansas by the Dakotas. They were\r\nmoved from one reservation to another, till in 1873 they were settled in\r\nIndian Territory; they have since steadily decreased, and now number\r\nsome 200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAWARDHA, a feudatory state of India, within the Central Provinces;\r\narea, 798 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 57,474, showing a decrease of 37% in the\r\ndecade, due to famine; estimated revenue, L7000. Half the state consists\r\nof hill and forest. The residence of the chief, who is a Raj Gond, is at\r\nKawardha (pop. 4772), which is also the headquarters of the Kabirpanthi\r\nsect (see KABIR).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAY, JOHN (1742-1826), Scottish caricaturist, was born near Dalkeith,\r\nwhere his father was a mason. At thirteen he was apprenticed to a\r\nbarber, whom he served for six years. He then went to Edinburgh, where\r\nin 1771 he obtained the freedom of the city by joining the corporation\r\nof barber-surgeons. In 1785, induced by the favour which greeted certain\r\nattempts of his to etch in aquafortis, he took down his barber's pole\r\nand opened a small print shop in Parliament Square. There he continued\r\nto flourish, painting miniatures, and publishing at short intervals his\r\nsketches and caricatures of local celebrities and oddities, who abounded\r\nat that period in Edinburgh society. He died on the 21st of February\r\n1826.\r\n\r\n  Kay's portraits were collected by Hugh Paton and published under the\r\n  title _A series of original portraits and caricature etchings by the\r\n  late John Kay, with biographical sketches and illustrative anecdotes_\r\n  (Edin., 2 vols. 4to, 1838; 8vo ed., 4 vols., 1842; new 4to ed., with\r\n  additional plates, 2 vols., 1877), forming a unique record of the\r\n  social life and popular habits of Edinburgh at its most interesting\r\n  epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAY, JOSEPH (1821-1878), English economist, was born at Salford,\r\nLancashire, on the 27th of February 1821. Educated privately and at\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple\r\nin 1848. He was appointed judge of the Salford Hundred court of record\r\nin 1862 and in 1869 was made a queen's counsel. He is best known for a\r\nseries of works on the social condition of the poor in France,\r\nSwitzerland, Holland, Germany and Austria, the materials for which he\r\ngathered on a four years' tour as travelling bachelor of his university.\r\nThey were _The Education of the Poor in England and Europe_ (London,\r\n1846); _The Social Condition of the People in England and Europe_\r\n(London, 1850, 2 vols.); _The Condition and Education of Poor Children\r\nin English and in German Towns_ (Manchester, 1853). He was also the\r\nauthor of _The Law relating to Shipmasters and Seamen_ (London, 1875)\r\nand _Free Trade in Land_ (1879, with a memoir). He died at Dorking,\r\nSurrey, on the 9th of October 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAYAK, or CAYAK, an Eskimo word for a fishing boat, in common use from\r\nGreenland to Alaska. It has been erroneously derived from the Arabic\r\n_caique_, supposed to have been applied to the native boats by early\r\nexplorers. The boat is made by covering a light wooden framework with\r\nsealskin. A hole is pierced in the centre of the top of the boat, and\r\nthe _kayaker_ (also dressed in sealskin) laces himself up securely when\r\nseated to prevent the entrance of water. The kayak is propelled like a\r\ncanoe by a double-bladed paddle. The name _kayak_ is properly only\r\napplied to the boat used by an Eskimo man--that used by a woman is\r\ncalled an _umiak_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAYASTH, the writer caste of Northern India, especially numerous and\r\ninfluential in Bengal. In 1901 their total number in all India was more\r\nthan two millions. Their claim to be Kshattriyas who have taken to\r\nclerical work is not admitted by the Brahmans. Under Mahommedan rule\r\nthey learnt Persian, and filled many important offices. They are now\r\neager students of English, and have supplied not only several judges to\r\nthe high court but also the first Hindu to be a member of the\r\ngovernor-general's council. In Bombay their place is taken by the\r\nPrabhus, and in Assam by the Kalitas (Kolitas); in Southern India there\r\nis no distinct clerical caste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAYE, SIR JOHN WILLIAM (1814-1876), English military historian, was the\r\nson of Charles Kaye, a solicitor, and was educated at Eton and the Royal\r\nMilitary College, Addiscombe. From 1832 to 1841 he was an officer in the\r\nBengal Artillery, afterwards spending some years in literary pursuits\r\nboth in India and in England. In 1856 he entered the civil service of\r\nthe East India Company, and when the government of India was transferred\r\nto the British crown succeeded John Stuart Mill as secretary of the\r\npolitical and secret department of the India office. In 1871 he was made\r\na K.C.S.I. He died in London on the 24th of July 1876. Kaye's numerous\r\nwritings include _History of the Sepoy War in India_ (London,\r\n1864-1876), which was revised and continued by Colonel G. B. Malleson\r\nand published in six volumes in 1888-1889; _History of the War in\r\nAfghanistan_ (London, 1851), republished in 1858 and 1874;\r\n_Administration of the East India Company_ (London, 1853); _The Life and\r\nCorrespondence of Charles, Lord Metcalfe_ (London, 1854); _The Life and\r\nCorrespondence of Henry St George Tucker_ (London, 1854); _Life and\r\nCorrespondence of Sir John Malcolm_ (London, 1856); _Christianity in\r\nIndia_ (London, 1859); _Lives of Indian Officers_ (London, 1867); and\r\ntwo novels, _Peregrine Pultney_ and _Long engagements_. He also edited\r\nseveral works dealing with Indian affairs; wrote _Essays of an Optimist_\r\n(London, 1870); and was a frequent contributor to periodicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAYSER, FRIEDRICH HEINRICH EMANUEL (1845-   ), German geologist and\r\npalaeontologist, was born at Konigsberg, on the 26th of March 1845. He\r\nwas educated at Berlin where he took his degree of Ph.D. in 1870. In\r\n1882 he became professor of geology in the university at Marburg. He\r\ninvestigated fossils of various ages and from all parts of the world,\r\nbut more especially from the Palaeozoic formations, including those of\r\nSouth Africa, the Polar regions, and notably the Devonian fossils of\r\nGermany, Bohemia and other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n  Among his separate works are _Lehrbuch der Geologie_ (2 vols., ii.),\r\n  _Geologische Formationskunde_ 1891 (2nd ed., 1902), and i. _Allgemeine\r\n  Geologie_ (1893), vol. ii. (the volume first issued) was translated\r\n  and edited by P. Lake, 1893, under the title _Textbook of Comparative\r\n  Geology_. Another work is _Beitrage zur Kenntniss der Fauna der\r\n  Siegenschen Grauwacke_ (1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAY-SHUTTLEWORTH, SIR JAMES PHILLIPS, BART. (1804-1877), English\r\npolitician and educationalist, was born at Rochdale, Lancashire, on the\r\n20th of July 1804, the son of Robert Kay. At first engaged in a Rochdale\r\nbank, in 1824 he became a medical student at Edinburgh University.\r\nSettling in Manchester about 1827, he worked for the Ancoats and Ardwick\r\nDispensary, and the experience which he thus gained of the conditions of\r\nthe poor in the Lancashire factory districts, together with his interest\r\nin economic science, led to his appointment in 1835 as poor law\r\ncommissioner in Norfolk and Suffolk and later in the London districts.\r\nIn 1839 he was appointed first secretary of the committee formed by the\r\nPrivy Council to administer the Government grant for the public\r\neducation in Great Britain. He is remembered as having founded at\r\nBattersea, London, in conjunction with E. Carleton Tufnell, the first\r\ntraining college for school teachers (1839-1840); and the system of\r\nnational school education of the present day, with its public\r\ninspection, trained teachers and its support by state as well as local\r\nfunds, is largely due to his initiative. In 1842 he married Lady Janet\r\nShuttleworth, assuming by royal licence his bride's name and arms. A\r\nbreakdown in his health led him to resign his post on the committee in\r\n1849, but subsequent recovery enabled him to take an active part in the\r\nworking of the central relief committee instituted under Lord Derby,\r\nduring the Lancashire cotton famine of 1861-1865. He was created a\r\nbaronet in 1849. Until the end of his life he interested himself in the\r\nmovements of the Liberal party in Lancashire, and the progress of\r\neducation. He died in London on the 26th of May 1877. His _Physiology,\r\nPathology and Treatment of Asphyxia_ became a standard textbook, and he\r\nalso wrote numerous papers on public education.\r\n\r\nHis son, Sir Ughtred James Kay-Shuttleworth (b. 1844), became a\r\nwell-known Liberal politician, sitting in parliament for Hastings from\r\n1869 to 1880 and for the Clitheroe division of Lancashire from 1885 till\r\n1902, when he was created Baron Shuttleworth. He was chancellor of the\r\nduchy of Lancaster in 1886, and secretary to the Admiralty in 1892-1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAZALA, or KAZALINSK, a fort and town in the Russian province of\r\nSyr-darya in West Turkestan, at the point where the Kazala River falls\r\ninto the Syr-darya, about 50 m. from its mouth in Lake Aral, in 45 deg.\r\n45' N. and 62 deg. 7' E., \"at the junction,\" to quote Schuyler, \"of all\r\nthe trade routes in Central Asia, as the road from Orenburg meets here\r\nwith the Khiva, Bokhara and Tashkent roads.\" Besides carrying on an\r\nactive trade with the Kirghiz of the surrounding country, it is of\r\ngrowing importance in the general current of commerce. Pop. (1897),\r\n7600. The floods in the river make it an island in spring; in summer it\r\nis parched by the sun and hot winds, and hardly a tree can be got to\r\ngrow. The streets are wide, but the houses, as well as the fairly strong\r\nfort, are built of mud bricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAZAN, a government of middle Russia, surrounded by the governments of\r\nVyatka, Ufa, Samara, Simbirsk, Nizhniy-Novgorod and Kostroma. Area\r\n24,601 sq. m. It belongs to the basins of the Volga and its tributary\r\nthe Kama, and by these streams the government is divided into three\r\nregions; the first, to the right of the main river, is traversed by deep\r\nravines sloping to the north-east, towards the Volga, and by two ranges\r\nof hills, one of which (300 to 500 ft.) skirts the river; the second\r\nregion, between the left bank of the Volga and the left bank of the\r\nKama, is an open steppe; and the third, between the left bank of the\r\nVolga and the right bank of the Kama, resembles in its eastern part the\r\nfirst region, and in its western part is covered with forest. Marls,\r\nlimestones and sandstones, of Permian or Triassic age, are the principal\r\nrocks; the Jurassic formation appears in a small part of the Tetyushi\r\ndistrict in the south; and Tertiary rocks stretch along the left bank of\r\nthe Volga. Mineral springs (iron, sulphur and petroleum) exist in\r\nseveral places. The Volga is navigable throughout its course of 200 m.\r\nthrough Kazan, as well as the Kama (120 m.); and the Vyatka, Kazanka,\r\nRutka, Tsivyl, Greater Kokshaga, Ilet, Vetluga and Mesha, are not\r\nwithout value as waterways. About four hundred small lakes are\r\nenumerated within the government; the upper and lower Kaban supply the\r\ncity of Kazan with water.\r\n\r\nThe climate is severe, the annual mean temperature being 37.8 deg. F.\r\nThe rainfall amounts to 16 in. Agriculture is the chief occupation, and\r\n82% of the population are peasants. Out of 7,672,600 acres of arable\r\nland, 4,516,500 are under crops--chiefly rye and oats, with some wheat,\r\nbarley, buckwheat, lentils, flax, hemp and potatoes. But there generally\r\nresults great scarcity, and even famine, in bad years. Live stock are\r\nnumerous. Forests cover 35% of the total area. Bee-keeping is an\r\nimportant industry. Factories employ about 10,000 persons and include\r\nflour-mills, distilleries, factories for soap, candles and tallow, and\r\ntanneries. A great variety of petty trades, especially those connected\r\nwith wood, are carried on in the villages, partly for export. The fairs\r\nare well attended. There is considerable shipping on the Volga, Kama,\r\nVyatka and their tributaries. Kazan is divided into twelve districts.\r\nThe chief town is Kazan (q.v.). The district capitals, with their\r\npopulations in 1897 are: Cheboksary (4568), Chistopol (20,161),\r\nKozmodemyansk (5212), Laishev (5439), Mamadyzh (4213), Spask (2779),\r\nSviyazhsk (2363), Tetyushi (4754). Tsarevokokshaisk (1654), Tsivylsk\r\n(2337) and Yadrin (2467). Population (1879), 1,872,437; (1897),\r\n2,190,185, of whom 1,113,555 were women, and 176,396 lived in towns. The\r\nestimated population in 1906 was 2,504,400. It consists principally of\r\nRussians and Tatars, with a variety of Finno-Turkish tribes: Chuvashes,\r\nCheremisses, Mordvinians, Votyaks, Mescheryaks, and some Jews and Poles.\r\nThe Russians belong to the Orthodox Greek Church or are Nonconformists;\r\nthe Tatars are Mussulmans; and the Finno-Turkish tribes are either\r\npagans or belong officially to the Orthodox Greek Church, the respective\r\nproportions being (in 1897): Orthodox Greek, 69.4% of the whole;\r\nNonconformists, 1%; Mussulmans, 28.8%.     (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAZAN (called by the Cheremisses _Ozon_), a town of eastern Russia,\r\ncapital of the government of the same name, situated in 55 deg. 48' N.\r\nand 49 deg. 26\" E., on the river Kazanka, 3 m. from the Volga, which\r\nhowever reaches the city when it overflows its banks every spring. Kazan\r\nlies 650 m. E. from Moscow by rail and 253 m. E. of Nizhniy-Novgorod by\r\nthe Volga. Pop. (1883), 140,726; (1900), 143,707, all Russians except\r\nfor some 20,000 Tatars. The most striking feature of the city is the\r\n_kreml_ or citadel, founded in 1437, which crowns a low hill on the N.W.\r\nWithin its wall, capped with five towers, it contains several churches,\r\namongst them the cathedral of the Annunciation, founded in 1562 by Gury,\r\nthe first archbishop of Kazan, Kazan being an archiepiscopal see of the\r\nOrthodox Greek Church. Other buildings in the kreml are a magnificent\r\nmonastery, built in 1556; an arsenal; the modern castle in which the\r\ngovernor resides; and the red brick Suyumbeka tower, 246 ft. high, which\r\nis an object of great veneration to the Tatars as the reputed\r\nburial-place of one of their saints. A little E. of the kreml is the\r\nBogoroditski convent, built in 1579 for the reception of the Black\r\nVirgin of Kazan, a miracle-working image transferred to Moscow in 1612,\r\nand in St Petersburg since 1710. Kazan is the intellectual capital of\r\neastern Russia, and an important seat of Oriental scholarship. Its\r\nuniversity, founded in 1804, is attended by nearly 1000 students.\r\nAttached to it are an excellent library of 220,000 vols., an\r\nastronomical observatory, a botanical garden and various museums. The\r\necclesiastical academy, founded in 1846, contains the old library of the\r\nSolovetsk (Solovki) monastery, which is of importance for the history of\r\nRussian religious sects. The city is adorned with bronze statues of Tsar\r\nAlexander II., set up facing the kreml in 1895, and of the poet G. R.\r\nDerzhavin (1743-1816); also with a monument commemorating the capture of\r\nKazan by Ivan the Terrible. The central parts of the city consist\r\nprincipally of small one-storeyed houses, surrounded by gardens, and are\r\ninhabited chiefly by Russians, while some 20,000 Tatars dwell in the\r\nsuburbs. Kazan is, further, the intellectual centre of the Russian\r\nMahommedans, who have here their more important schools and their\r\nprinting-presses. Between the city and the Volga is the Admiralty\r\nsuburb, where Peter the Great had his Caspian fleet built for his\r\ncampaigns against Persia. The more important manufactures are leather\r\ngoods, soap, wax candles, sacred images, cloth, cottons, spirits and\r\nbells. A considerable trade is carried on with eastern Russia, and with\r\nTurkestan and Persia. Previous to the 13th century, the present\r\ngovernment of Kazan formed part of the territory of the Bulgarians, the\r\nruins of whose ancient capital, Bolgari or Bolgary, lie 60 m. S. of\r\nKazan. The city of Kazan itself stood, down to the 13th century, 30 m.\r\nto the N.E., where traces of it can still be seen. In 1438 Ulugh\r\nMahommed (or Ulu Makhmet), khan of the Golden Horde of the Mongols,\r\nfounded, on the ruins of the Bulgarian state, the kingdom of Kazan,\r\nwhich in its turn was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible of Russia in 1552\r\nand its territory annexed to Russia. In 1774 the city was laid waste by\r\nthe rebel Pugachev. It has suffered repeatedly from fires, especially in\r\n1815 and 1825. The Kazan Tatars, from having lived so long amongst\r\nRussians and Finnish tribes, have lost a good many of the characteristic\r\nfeatures of their Tatar (Mongol) ancestry, and bear now the stamp of a\r\ndistinct ethnographic type. They are found also in the neighbouring\r\ngovernments of Vyatka, Ufa, Orenburg, Samara, Saratov, Simbirsk, Tambov\r\nand Nizhniy-Novgorod. They are intelligent and enterprising, and are\r\nengaged principally in trade.\r\n\r\n  See Pineghin's _Kazan Old and New_ (in Russian); Velyaminov-Zernov's\r\n  _Kasimov Tsars_ (3 vols., St Petersburg, 1863-1866); Zarinsky's\r\n  _Sketches of Old Kazan_ (Kazan, 1877); Trofimov's _Siege of Kazan in_\r\n  1552 (Kazan, 1890); Firsov's books on the history of the native\r\n  population (Kazan, 1864 and 1869); and Shpilevski, on the antiquities\r\n  of the town and government, in _Izvestia i Zapiski_ of the Kazan\r\n  University (1877). A bibliography of the Oriental books published in\r\n  the city is printed in _Bulletins_ of the St Petersburg Academy\r\n  (1867). Compare also L. Leger's \"Kazan et les tartares,\" in _Bibl.\r\n  Univ. de Geneve_ (1874).     (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAZERUN, a district and town of the province of Fars in Persia. The\r\ndistrict is situated between Shiraz and Bushire. In its centre is the\r\nKazerun Valley with a direction N.W. to S.E., a fertile plain 30 m. long\r\nand 7 to 8 m. broad, bounded S.E. by the Parishan Lake (8 m. long, 3 m.\r\nbroad) N.W. by the Boshavir River, with the ruins of the old city of\r\nBeh-Shahpur (Beshaver, Boshavir, also, short, Shapur) and Sassanian\r\nbas-reliefs on its banks. There also, in a cave, is a statue of Shapur.\r\nThe remainder of the district is mostly hilly country intersected by\r\nnumerous streams, plains and hills being covered with zizyphus, wild\r\nalmond and oak. The district is divided into two divisions: town and\r\nvillages, the latter being called Kuh i Marreh and again subdivided into\r\n(1) Pusht i Kuh; (2) Yarruk; (3) Shakan. It has forty-six villages and a\r\npopulation of about 15,000; it produces rice of excellent quality,\r\ncotton, tobacco and opium, but very little corn, and bread made of the\r\nflour of acorns is a staple of food in many villages. Wild almonds are\r\nexported.\r\n\r\nKazerun, the chief place of the district, is an unwalled town situated\r\nin the midst of the central plain, in 29 deg. 37' N., 51 deg. 43' E. at\r\nan elevation of 2800 ft., 70 m. from Shiraz, and 96 m. from Bushire. It\r\nhas a population of about 8000, and is divided into four quarters\r\nseparated by open spaces. Adjoining it on the W. is the famous Nazar\r\ngarden, with noble avenues of orange trees planted by a former governor,\r\nHajji Ali Kuli Khan, in 1767. A couple of miles N. of the city behind a\r\nlow range of hills are the imposing ruins of a marble building said to\r\nstand over the grave of Sheik Amin ed din Mahommed b. Zia ed din Mas'ud,\r\nwho died A.H. 740 (A.D. 1339). S.E. of the city on a huge mound are\r\nruins of buildings with underground chambers, popularly known as Kal'eh\r\ni Gabr, \"castle of the fire-worshippers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAZINCZY, FERENCZ (1750-1831), Hungarian author, the most indefatigable\r\nagent in the regeneration of the Magyar language and literature at the\r\nend of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, was born on the 27th\r\nof October 1759, at Er-Semlyen, in the county of Bihar, Hungary. He\r\nstudied law at Kassa and Eperies, and in Pest, where he also obtained a\r\nthorough knowledge of French and German literature, and made the\r\nacquaintance of Gideon Raday, who allowed him the use of his library. In\r\n1784 Kazinczy became subnotary for the county of Abauj; and in 1786 he\r\nwas nominated inspector of schools at Kassa. There he began to devote\r\nhimself to the restoration of the Magyar language and literature by\r\ntranslations from classical foreign works, and by the augmentation of\r\nthe native vocabulary from ancient Magyar sources. In 1788, with the\r\nassistance of Baroti Szabo and John Bacsanyi, he started at Kassa the\r\nfirst Magyar literary magazine, _Magyar Muzeum_; the _Orpheus_, which\r\nsucceeded it in 1790, was his own creation. Although, upon the accession\r\nof Leopold II, Kazinczy, as a non-Catholic, was obliged to resign his\r\npost at Kassa, his literary activity in no way decreased. He not only\r\nassisted Gideon Raday in the establishment and direction of the first\r\nMagyar dramatic society, but enriched the repertoire with several\r\ntranslations from foreign authors. His _Hamlet_, which first appeared at\r\nKassa in 1790, is a rendering from the German version of Schroder.\r\nImplicated in the democratic conspiracy of the abbot Martinovics,\r\nKazinczy was arrested on the 14th of December 1794, and condemned to\r\ndeath; but the sentence was commuted to imprisonment. He was released in\r\n1801, and shortly afterwards married Sophia Torok, daughter of his\r\nformer patron, and retired to his small estate at Szephalom or\r\n\"Fairhill,\" near Sator-Ujhely, in the county of Zemplen. In 1828 he took\r\nan active part in the conferences held for the establishment of the\r\nHungarian academy in the historical section of which he became the first\r\ncorresponding member. He died of Asiatic cholera, at Szephalom, on the\r\n22nd of August 1831.\r\n\r\n  Kazinczy, although possessing great beauty of style, cannot be\r\n  regarded as a powerful and original thinker; his fame is chiefly due\r\n  to the felicity of his translations from the masterpieces of Lessing,\r\n  Goethe, Wieland, Klopstock, Ossian, La Rochefoucauld, Marmontel,\r\n  Moliere, Metastasio, Shakespeare, Sterne, Cicero, Sallust, Anacreon,\r\n  and many others. He also edited the works of Baroczy (Pest, 1812, 8\r\n  vols.) and of the poet Zrinyi (1817, 2 vols.), and the poems of Dayka\r\n  (1813, 3 vols.) and of John Kis, (1815, 3 vols.). A collective edition\r\n  of his works (_Szep Literatura_), consisting for the most part of\r\n  translations, was published at Pest, 1814-1816, in 9 vols. His\r\n  original productions (_Eredeti Mukai_), largely made up of letters,\r\n  were edited by Joseph Bajza and Francis Toldy at Pest, 1836-1845, in 5\r\n  vols. Editions of his poems appeared in 1858 and in 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAZVIN, a province and town of Persia. The province is situated N.W. of\r\nTeheran and S. of Gilan. On the W. it is bounded by Khamseh. It pays a\r\nyearly revenue of about L22,000, and contains many rich villages which\r\nproduce much grain and fruit, great quantities of the latter being dried\r\nand exported.\r\n\r\nKazvin, the capital of the province, is situated at an elevation of 4165\r\nft., in 36 deg. 15' N. and 50 deg. E., and 92 m. by road from Teheran.\r\nThe city is said to have been founded in the 4th century by the\r\nSassanian king Shapur II (309-379). It has been repeatedly damaged by\r\nearthquakes. Many of its streets and most of the magnificent buildings\r\nseen there by Chardin in 1674 and other travellers during the 17th\r\ncentury are in ruins. The most remarkable remains are the palace of the\r\nSafawid shahs and the mosque with its large blue dome. In the 16th\r\ncentury Shah Tahmasp I. (1524-1576) made Kazvin his capital, and it\r\nremained so till Shah Abbas I. (1587-1629) transferred the seat of\r\ngovernment to Isfahan. The town still bears the title Dar es Salteneh,\r\n\"the seat of government.\" Kazvin has many baths and cisterns fed by\r\nunderground canals. The system of irrigation formerly carried on by\r\nthese canals rendered the plain of Kazvin one of the most fertile\r\nregions in Persia; now most of the canals are choked up. The city has a\r\npopulation of about 50,000 and a thriving transit trade, particularly\r\nsince 1899 when the carriage road between Resht and Teheran with Kazvin\r\nas a half-way stage was opened under the auspices of the Russian\r\n\"Enzeli-Teheran Road Company.\" Great quantities of rice, fish and silk\r\nare brought to it from Gilan for distribution in Persia and export to\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEAN, EDMUND (1787-1833), was born in London on the 17th of March[1]\r\n1787. His father was probably Edmund Kean, an architect's clerk; and his\r\nmother was an actress, Ann Carey, grand-daughter of Henry Carey. When in\r\nhis fourth year Kean made his first appearance on the stage as Cupid in\r\nNoverre's ballet of _Cymon_. As a child his vivacity and cleverness, and\r\nhis ready affection for those who treated him with kindness, made him a\r\nuniversal favourite, but the harsh circumstances of his lot, and the\r\nwant of proper restraint, while they developed strong self-reliance,\r\nfostered wayward tendencies. About 1794 a few benevolent persons\r\nprovided the means of sending him to school, where he mastered his tasks\r\nwith remarkable ease and rapidity; but finding the restraint\r\nintolerable, he shipped as a cabin boy at Portsmouth. Discovering that\r\nhe had only escaped to a more rigorous bondage, he counterfeited both\r\ndeafness and lameness with a histrionic mastery which deceived even the\r\nphysicians at Madeira. On his return to England he sought the protection\r\nof his uncle Moses Kean, mimic, ventriloquist and general entertainer,\r\nwho, besides continuing his pantomimic studies, introduced him to the\r\nstudy of Shakespeare. At the same time Miss Tidswell, an actress who had\r\nbeen specially kind to him from infancy, taught him the principles of\r\nacting. On the death of his uncle he was taken charge of by Miss\r\nTidswell, and under her direction he began the systematic study of the\r\nprincipal Shakespearian characters, displaying the peculiar originality\r\nof his genius by interpretations entirely different from those of\r\nKemble. His talents and interesting countenance induced a Mrs Clarke to\r\nadopt him, but the slight of a visitor so wounded his pride that he\r\nsuddenly left her house and went back to his old surroundings. In his\r\nfourteenth year he obtained an engagement to play leading characters for\r\ntwenty nights in York Theatre, appearing as Hamlet, Hastings and Cato.\r\nShortly afterwards, while he was in the strolling troupe belonging to\r\nRichardson's show, the rumour of his abilities reached George III., who\r\ncommanded him to recite at Windsor. He subsequently joined Saunders's\r\ncircus, where in the performance of an equestrian feat he fell and broke\r\nhis legs--the accident leaving traces of swelling in his insteps\r\nthroughout his life. About this time he picked up music from Charles\r\nIncledon, dancing from D'Egville, and fencing from Angelo. In 1807 he\r\nplayed leading parts in the Belfast theatre with Mrs Siddons, who began\r\nby calling him \"a horrid little man\" and on further experience of his\r\nability said that he \"played very, very well,\" but that \"there was too\r\nlittle of him to make a great actor.\" An engagement in 1808 to play\r\nleading characters in Beverley's provincial troupe was brought to an\r\nabrupt close by his marriage (July 17) with Miss Mary Chambers of\r\nWaterford, the leading actress. For several years his prospects were\r\nvery gloomy, but in 1814 the committee of Drury Lane theatre, the\r\nfortunes of which were then so low that bankruptcy seemed inevitable,\r\nresolved to give him a chance among the \"experiments\" they were making\r\nto win a return of popularity. When the expectation of his first\r\nappearance in London was close upon him he was so feverish that he\r\nexclaimed \"If I succeed I shall go mad.\" His opening at Drury Lane on\r\nthe 26th of January 1814 as Shylock roused the audience to almost\r\nuncontrollable enthusiasm. Successive appearances in Richard III.,\r\nHamlet, Othello, Macbeth and Lear served to demonstrate his complete\r\nmastery of the whole range of tragic emotion. His triumph was so great\r\nthat he himself said on one occasion, \"I could not feel the stage under\r\nme.\" On the 29th of November 1820 Kean appeared for the first time in\r\nNew York as Richard III. The success of his visit to America was\r\nunequivocal, although he fell into a vexatious dispute with the press.\r\nOn the 4th of June 1821 he returned to England.\r\n\r\nProbably his irregular habits were prejudicial to the refinement of his\r\ntaste, and latterly they tended to exaggerate his special defects and\r\nmannerisms. The adverse decision in the divorce case of Cox v. Kean on\r\nthe 17th of January 1825 caused his wife to leave him, and aroused\r\nagainst him such bitter feeling, shown by the almost riotous conduct of\r\nthe audiences before which he appeared about this time, as nearly to\r\ncompel him to retire permanently into private life. A second visit to\r\nAmerica in 1825 was largely a repetition of the persecution which, in\r\nthe name of morality, he had suffered in England. Some cities showed him\r\na spirit of charity; many audiences submitted him to the grossest\r\ninsults and endangered his life by the violence of their disapproval. In\r\nQuebec he was much impressed with the kindness of some Huron Indians who\r\nattended his performances, and he was made chief of the tribe, receiving\r\nthe name Alanienouidet. Kean's last appearance in New York was on the\r\n5th of December 1826 in Richard III., the role in which he was first\r\nseen in America. He returned to England and was ultimately received with\r\nall the old favour, but the contest had made him so dependent on the use\r\nof stimulants that the gradual deterioration of his gifts was\r\ninevitable. Still, even in their decay his great powers triumphed during\r\nthe moments of his inspiration over the absolute wreck of his physical\r\nfaculties, and compelled admiration after his gait had degenerated into\r\na weak hobble, and the lightning brilliancy of his eyes had become dull\r\nand bloodshot, and the tones of his matchless voice marred by rough and\r\ngrating hoarseness. His appearance in Paris was a failure owing to a fit\r\nof drunkenness. His last appearance on the stage was at Covent Garden,\r\non the 25th of March 1833 when he played Othello to the Iago of his son\r\nCharles. At the words \"Villain, be sure,\" in scene 3 of act iii., he\r\nsuddenly broke down, and crying in a faltering voice \"O God, I am dying.\r\nSpeak to them, Charles,\" fell insensible into his son's arms. He died at\r\nRichmond on the 15th of May 1833.\r\n\r\nIt was in the impersonation of the great creations of Shakespeare's\r\ngenius that the varied beauty and grandeur of the acting of Kean were\r\ndisplayed in their highest form, although probably his most powerful\r\ncharacter was Sir Giles Overreach in Massinger's _A New Way to Pay Old\r\nDebts_, the effect of his first impersonation of which was such that the\r\npit rose _en masse_, and even the actors and actresses themselves were\r\novercome by the terrific dramatic illusion. His only personal\r\ndisadvantage as an actor was his small stature. His countenance was\r\nstrikingly interesting and unusually mobile; he had a matchless command\r\nof facial expression; his fine eyes scintillated with the slightest\r\nshades of emotion and thought; his voice, though weak and harsh in the\r\nupper register, possessed in its lower range tones of penetrating and\r\nresistless power, and a thrilling sweetness like the witchery of the\r\nfinest music; above all, in the grander moments of his passion, his\r\nintellect and soul seemed to rise beyond material barriers and to\r\nglorify physical defects with their own greatness. Kean specially\r\nexcelled as the exponent of passion. In Othello, Iago, Shylock and\r\nRichard III., characters utterly different from each other, but in which\r\nthe predominant element is some form of passion, his identification with\r\nthe personality, as he had conceived it, was as nearly as possible\r\nperfect, and each isolated phase and aspect of the plot was elaborated\r\nwith the minutest attention to details, and yet with an absolute\r\nsubordination of these to the distinct individuality he was endeavouring\r\nto portray. Coleridge said, \"Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare\r\nby flashes of lightning.\" If the range of character in which Kean\r\nattained supreme excellence was narrow, no one except Garrick has been\r\nso successful in so many great impersonations. Unlike Garrick, he had no\r\ntrue talent for comedy, but in the expression of biting and saturnine\r\nwit, of grim and ghostly gaiety, he was unsurpassed. His eccentricities\r\nat the height of his fame were numerous. Sometimes he would ride\r\nrecklessly on his horse Shylock throughout the night. He was presented\r\nwith a tame lion with which he might be found playing in his\r\ndrawing-room. The prizefighters Mendoza and Richmond the Black were\r\namong his visitors. Grattan was his devoted friend. In his earlier days\r\nTalma said of him, \"He is a magnificent uncut gem; polish and round him\r\noff and he will be a perfect tragedian.\" Macready, who was much\r\nimpressed by Kean's Richard III. and met the actor at supper, speaks of\r\nhis \"unassuming manner ... partaking in some degree of shyness\" and of\r\nthe \"touching grace\" of his singing. Kean's delivery of the three words\r\n\"I answer--NO!\" in the part of Sir Edward Mortimer in _The Iron Chest_,\r\ncast Macready into an abyss of despair at rivalling him in this role. So\r\nfull of dramatic interest is the life of Edmund Kean that it formed the\r\nsubject for a play by the elder Dumas, entitled _Kean on desordre et\r\ngenie_, in which Frederick-Lemaitre achieved one of his greatest\r\ntriumphs.\r\n\r\n  See Francis Phippen, _Authentic Memoirs of Edmund Kean_ (1814); B. W.\r\n  Procter (Barry Cornwall), _The Life of Edmund Kean_ (1835); F. W.\r\n  Hawkins, _The Life of Edmund Kean_ (1869); J. Fitzgerald Molloy, _The\r\n  Life and Adventures of Edmund Kean_ (1888); Edward Stirling, _Old\r\n  Drury Lane_ (1887).\r\n\r\nHis son, CHARLES JOHN KEAN (1811-1868), was born at Waterford, Ireland,\r\non the 18th of January 1811. After preparatory education at Worplesdon\r\nand at Greenford, near Harrow, he was sent to Eton College, where he\r\nremained three years. In 1827 he was offered a cadetship in the East\r\nIndia Company's service, which he was prepared to accept if his father\r\nwould settle an income of L400 on his mother. The elder Kean refused to\r\ndo this, and his son determined to become an actor. He made his first\r\nappearance at Drury Lane on the 1st of October 1827 as Norval in Home's\r\n_Douglas_, but his continued failure to achieve popularity led him to\r\nleave London in the spring of 1828 for the provinces. At Glasgow, on the\r\n1st of October in this year, father and son acted together in Arnold\r\nPayne's _Brutus_, the elder Kean in the title-part and his son as Titus.\r\nAfter a visit to America in 1830, where he was received with much\r\nfavour, he appeared in 1833 at Covent Garden as Sir Edmund Mortimer in\r\nColman's _The Iron Chest_, but his success was not pronounced enough to\r\nencourage him to remain in London, especially as he had already won a\r\nhigh position in the provinces. In January 1838, however, he returned to\r\nDrury Lane, and played Hamlet with a success which gave him a place\r\namong the principal tragedians of his time. He was married to the\r\nactress Ellen Tree (1805-1880) on the 29th of January 1842, and paid a\r\nsecond visit to America with her from 1845 to 1847. Returning to\r\nEngland, he entered on a successful engagement at the Haymarket, and in\r\n1850, with Robert Keeley, became lessee of the Princess Theatre. The\r\nmost noteworthy feature of his management was a series of gorgeous\r\nShakespearian revivals. Charles Kean was not a great tragic actor. He\r\ndid all that could be done by the persevering cultivation of his powers,\r\nand in many ways manifested the possession of high intelligence and\r\nrefined taste, but his defects of person and voice made it impossible\r\nfor him to give a representation at all adequate of the varying and\r\nsubtle emotions of pure tragedy. But in melodramatic parts such as the\r\nking in Boucicault's adaptation of Casimir Delavigne's _Louis XI._, and\r\nLouis and Fabian dei Franchi in Boucicault's adaptation of Dumas's _The\r\nCorsican Brothers_, his success was complete. From his \"tour round the\r\nworld\" Kean returned in 1866 in broken health, and died in London on the\r\n22nd of January 1868.\r\n\r\n  See _The Life and Theatrical Times of Charles Kean_, by John William\r\n  Cole (1859).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] This date is apparently settled by a letter from Kean in 1829, to\r\n    Dr Gibson (see _Rothesay Express_ for the 28th of June 1893, where\r\n    the letter is printed and vouched for), inviting him to dinner on the\r\n    17th of March to celebrate Kean's birthday; various other dates have\r\n    been given in books of reference, the 4th of November having been\r\n    formerly accepted by this Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEANE, JOHN JOSEPH (1839-   ), American Roman Catholic archbishop, was\r\nborn in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal, Ireland, on the 12th of September\r\n1839. His family settled in America when he was seven years old. He was\r\neducated at Saint Charles's College, Ellicott City, Maryland, and at\r\nSaint Mary's Seminary, Baltimore, and in 1866 was ordained a priest and\r\nmade curate of St Patrick's, Washington, D.C. On the 25th of August 1878\r\nhe was consecrated Bishop of Richmond, to succeed James Gibbons, and he\r\nhad established the Confraternity of the Holy Ghost in that diocese, and\r\nfounded schools and churches for negroes before his appointment as\r\nrector of the Catholic University, Washington, D.C., in 1886, and his\r\nappointment in 1888 to the see of Ajasso. He did much to upbuild the\r\nCatholic University, but his democratic and liberal policy made him\r\nenemies at Rome, whence there came in 1896 a request for his resignation\r\nof the rectorate, and where he spent the years 1897-1900 as canon of St\r\nJohn Lateran, assistant bishop at the pontifical throne, and counsellor\r\nto the Propaganda. In 1900 he was consecrated archbishop of Dubuque,\r\nIowa. He took a prominent part in the Catholic Young Men's National\r\nUnion and in the Total Abstinence Union of North America; and was in\r\ngeneral charge of the Catholic delegation to the World's Parliament of\r\nReligions held at the Columbian Exposition in 1893. He lectured widely\r\non temperance, education and American institutions, and in 1890 was\r\nDudleian lecturer at Harvard University.\r\n\r\n  A selection from his writings and addresses was edited by Maurice\r\n  Francis Egan under the title _Onward and Upward: A Year Book_\r\n  (Baltimore, 1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEARNEY, a city and the county-seat of Buffalo county, Nebraska, U.S.A.,\r\nabout 130 m. W. of Lincoln. Pop. (1890), 8074; (1900), 5634 (650\r\nforeign-born); (1910), 6202. It is on the main overland line of the\r\nUnion Pacific, and on a branch of the Burlington & Missouri River\r\nrailroad. The city is situated in the broad, flat bottom-lands a short\r\ndistance N. of the Platte River. Lake Kearney, in the city, has an area\r\nof 40 acres. The surrounding region is rich farming land, devoted\r\nespecially to the growing of alfalfa and Indian corn. At Kearney are a\r\nState Industrial School for boys, a State Normal School, the Kearney\r\nMilitary Academy, and a Carnegie library. Good water-power is provided\r\nby a canal from the Platte River about 17 m. above Kearney, and the\r\ncity's manufactures include foundry and machine-shop products, flour and\r\nbricks. Kearney Junction, as Kearney was called from 1872 to 1875, was\r\nsettled a year before the two railways actually formed their junction\r\nhere, where the city was planned. Kearney became a town in 1873, a city\r\nof the second class and the county seat in 1874, and a city of the first\r\nclass in 1901. It is to be distinguished from an older and once famous\r\nprairie city, popularly known as \"Dobey Town\" (i.e. Adobe), founded in\r\nthe early 'fifties on the edge of the reservation of old Fort Kearney\r\n(removed in 1848 from Nebraska City), in Kearney county, on the S. shore\r\nof the Platte about 6 m. S.E. of the present Kearney; here in 1861 the\r\npost office of Kearney City was established. In the days of the prairie\r\nfreighting caravans Dobey Town was one of the most important towns\r\nbetween Independence, Missouri, and the Pacific coast, and it had a\r\nrough, wild, picturesque history; but it lost its immense freighting\r\ninterests after the Union Pacific had been extended through it in 1866.\r\nThe site of Dobey Town, together with the Fort, was abandoned in 1871.\r\nFort Kearney and the city too were named in honour of General Stephen W.\r\nKearny, and the name was at first correctly spelt without a second \"e.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEARNY, PHILIP (1815-1862), American soldier, was born in New York on\r\nthe 2nd of June 1815, and was originally intended for the legal\r\nprofession. He graduated at Columbia University (1833), but his bent was\r\ndecidedly towards soldiering, and in 1837 he obtained a commission in\r\nthe cavalry regiment of which his uncle, (General) Stephen Watts Kearny\r\n(1794-1848), was colonel and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis adjutant. Two\r\nyears later he was sent to France to study the methods of cavalry\r\ntraining in vogue there. Before his return to the United States in 1840\r\nhe had served, on leave, in Algeria. He had inherited a large fortune,\r\nbut he remained in the service, and his wide experience of cavalry work\r\ncaused him to be employed on the headquarters staff of the army. After\r\nsix more years' service Kearny left the army, but almost immediately\r\nafterwards he rejoined, bringing with him a company of cavalry, which he\r\nhad raised and equipped chiefly at his own expense, to take part in the\r\nMexican war. In December 1846 he was promoted captain. In leading a\r\nbrilliant cavalry charge at Churubusco he lost his left arm, but he\r\nremained at the front, and won the brevet of major for his gallantry at\r\nContreras and Churubusco. In 1851 he again resigned, to travel round the\r\nworld. He saw further active service with his old comrades of the French\r\ncavalry in the Italian war of 1859, and received the cross of the Legion\r\nof Honour for his conduct at Solferino. Up to the outbreak of the\r\nAmerican Civil War he lived in Paris, but early in 1861 he hastened home\r\nto join the Federal army. At first as a brigade commander and later as a\r\ndivisional commander of infantry in the Army of the Potomac, he infused\r\ninto his men his own cavalry spirit of dash and bravery. At\r\nWilliamsburg, Seven Pines, and Second Bull Run, he displayed his usual\r\nromantic courage, but at Chantilly (Sept. 1, 1862), after repulsing an\r\nattack of the enemy, he rode out in the dark too far to the front, and\r\nmistaking the Confederates for his own men was shot dead. His body was\r\nsent to the Federal lines with a message from General Lee, and was\r\nburied in Trinity Churchyard, New York. His commission as major-general\r\nof volunteers was dated July 4, 1862, but he never received it.\r\n\r\n  See J. W. de Peyster, _Personal and Military History of Philip Kearny_\r\n  (New York, 1869).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEARNY, a town of Hudson county, New Jersey, U.S.A., between the Passaic\r\nand Hackensack rivers, adjoining Harrison, and connected with Newark by\r\nbridges over the Passaic. Pop. (1900), 10,896, of whom 3597 were\r\nforeign-born; (1910 census), 18,659. The New York & Greenwood Lake\r\ndivision of the Erie railroad has a station at Arlington, the principal\r\nvillage (in the N.W. part), which contains attractive residences of\r\nNewark, Jersey City and New York City business men. The town covers an\r\narea of about 7 sq. m., including a large tract of marsh-land. In Kearny\r\nare railway repair shops of the Pennsylvania system, and a large\r\nabattoir; and there are numerous manufactures. The value of the town's\r\nfactory products increased from $1,607,002 in 1900 to $4,427,904 in\r\n1905, or 175.5%. Among its institutions are the State Soldiers' Home,\r\nremoved here from Newark in 1880, a Carnegie library, two Italian homes\r\nfor orphans, and a Catholic Industrial School for boys.\r\n\r\nThe neck of land between the Passaic and the Hackensack rivers, for 7 m.\r\nN. from where they unite, was purchased from the proprietors of East\r\nJersey and from the Indians by Captain William Sandford in 1668 and\r\nthrough Nathaniel Kingsland, sergeant-major of Barbadoes, received the\r\nname \"New Barbadoes.\" After the town under this name had been extended\r\nconsiderably to the northward, the town of Lodi was formed out of the S.\r\nportion in 1825, the town of Harrison was founded out of the S. portion\r\nof Lodi in 1840, and in 1867 a portion of Harrison was set apart as a\r\ntownship and named in honour of General Philip Kearny, a former\r\nresident. Kearny was incorporated as a town in 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEARY, ANNIE (1825-1879), English novelist, was born near Wetherby,\r\nYorkshire, on the 3rd of March 1825, the daughter of an Irish clergyman.\r\nShe was the author of several children's books and novels, of which the\r\nbest known is _Castle Daly_, an Irish story. She also wrote an _Early\r\nEgyptian History_ (1861) and _The Nation Around_ (1870). She died at\r\nEastbourne on the 3rd of March 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEATE, JOHN (1773-1852), English schoolmaster, was born at Wells,\r\nSomersetshire, in 1773, the son of Prebendary William Keate. He was\r\neducated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, where he had a brilliant\r\ncareer as a scholar; taking holy orders, he became, about 1797, an\r\nassistant master at Eton College. In 1809 he was elected headmaster. The\r\ndiscipline of the school was then in a most unsatisfactory condition,\r\nand Dr Keate (who took the degree of D.D. in 1810) took stern measures\r\nto improve it. His partiality for the birch became a by-word, but he\r\nsucceeded in restoring order and strengthening the weakened authority of\r\nthe masters. Beneath an outwardly rough manner the little man concealed\r\na really kind heart, and when he retired in 1834, the boys, who admired\r\nhis courage, presented him with a handsome testimonial. A couple of\r\nyears before he had publicly flogged eighty boys on one day. Keate was\r\nmade a canon of Windsor in 1820. He died on the 5th of March 1852 at\r\nHartley Westpall, Hampshire, of which parish he had been rector since\r\n1824.\r\n\r\n  See Maxwell Lyte, _History of Eton College_ (3rd ed., 1899); Collins,\r\n  _Etoniana_; Harwood, _Alumni Etonienses; Annual Register_ (1852);\r\n  _Gentleman's Magazine_ (1852).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEATS, JOHN (1795-1821), English poet, was born on the 29th or 31st of\r\nOctober 1795 at the sign of the Swan and Hoop, 24 The Pavement,\r\nMoorfields, London. He published his first volume of verse in 1817, his\r\nsecond in the following year, his third in 1820, and died of consumption\r\nat Rome on the 23rd of February 1821 in the fourth month of his\r\ntwenty-sixth year. (For the biographical facts see the later section of\r\nthis article.)\r\n\r\nIn Keats's first book there was little foretaste of anything greatly or\r\neven genuinely good; but between the marshy and sandy flats of sterile\r\nor futile verse there were undoubtedly some few purple patches of floral\r\npromise. The style was frequently detestable--a mixture of sham\r\nSpenserian and mock Wordsworthian, alternately florid and arid. His\r\nsecond book, _Endymion_, rises in its best passages to the highest level\r\nof Barnfield and of Lodge, the two previous poets with whom, had he\r\npublished nothing more, he might most properly have been classed; and\r\nthis, among minor minstrels, is no unenviable place. His third book\r\nraised him at once to a foremost rank in the highest class of English\r\npoets. Shelley, up to twenty, had written little or nothing that would\r\nhave done credit to a boy of ten; and of Keats also it may be said that\r\nthe merit of his work at twenty-five was hardly by comparison more\r\nwonderful than its demerit at twenty-two. His first book fell as flat as\r\nit deserved to fall; the reception of his second, though less\r\nconsiderate than on the whole it deserved, was not more contemptuous\r\nthan that of immeasurably better books published about the same time by\r\nColeridge, Landor and Shelley. A critic of exceptional carefulness and\r\ncandour might have noted in the first book so singular an example of a\r\nstork among the cranes as the famous and notable sonnet on Chapman's\r\nHomer; a just judge would have indicated, a partial advocate might have\r\nexaggerated, the value of such golden grain amid a garish harvest of\r\ntares as the hymn to Pan and the translation into verse of Titian's\r\nBacchanal which glorify the weedy wilderness of _Endymion_. But the\r\nhardest thing said of that poem by the _Quarterly_ reviewer was\r\nunconsciously echoed by the future author of _Adonais_--that it was all\r\nbut absolutely impossible to read through; and the obscener insolence of\r\nthe \"Blackguard's Magazine,\" as Landor afterwards very justly labelled\r\nit, is explicable though certainly not excusable if we glance back at\r\nsuch a passage as that where Endymion exchanges fulsome and liquorish\r\nendearments with the \"known unknown _from whom his being sips such\r\ndarling (!) essence_.\" Such nauseous and pitiful phrases as these, and\r\ncertain passages in his correspondence, make us understand the source of\r\nthe most offensive imputations or insinuations levelled against the\r\nwriter's manhood; and, while admitting that neither his love-letters,\r\nnor the last piteous outcries of his wailing and shrieking agony, would\r\never have been made public by merciful or respectful editors, we must\r\nalso admit that, if they ought never to have been published, it is no\r\nless certain that they ought never to have been written; that a manful\r\nkind of man or even a manly sort of boy, in his love-making or in his\r\nsuffering, will not howl and snivel after such a lamentable fashion. One\r\nthing hitherto inexplicable a very slight and rapid glance at his\r\namatory correspondence will amply suffice to explain: how it came to\r\npass that the woman so passionately beloved by so great a poet should\r\nhave thought it the hopeless attempt of a mistaken kindness to revive\r\nthe memory of a man for whom the best that could be wished was complete\r\nand compassionate oblivion. For the side of the man's nature presented\r\nto her inspection, this probably was all that charity or reason could\r\nhave desired. But that there was a finer side to the man, even if\r\nconsidered apart from the poet, his correspondence with his friends and\r\ntheir general evidence to his character give more sufficient proof than\r\nperhaps we might have derived from the general impression left on us by\r\nhis works; though indeed the preface to _Endymion_ itself, however\r\nillogical in its obviously implied suggestion that the poem published\r\nwas undeniably unworthy of publication, gave proof or hint at least that\r\nafter all its author was something of a man. And the eighteenth of his\r\nletters to Miss Brawne stands out in bright and brave contrast with such\r\nas seem incompatible with the traditions of his character on its manlier\r\nside. But if it must be said that he lived long enough only to give\r\npromise of being a man, it must also be said that he lived long enough\r\nto give assurance of being a poet who was not born to come short of the\r\nfirst rank. Not even a hint of such a probability could have been\r\ngathered from his first or even from his second appearance; after the\r\npublication of his third volume it was no longer a matter of possible\r\ndebate among judges of tolerable competence that this improbability had\r\nbecome a certainty. Two or three phrases cancelled, two or three lines\r\nerased, would have left us in _Lamia_ one of the most faultless as\r\nsurely as one of the most glorious jewels in the crown of English\r\npoetry. _Isabella_, feeble and awkward in narrative to a degree almost\r\nincredible in a student of Dryden and a pupil of Leigh Hunt, is\r\novercharged with episodical effects of splendid and pathetic expression\r\nbeyond the reach of either. _The Eve of St Agnes_, aiming at no doubtful\r\nsuccess, succeeds in evading all casual difficulty in the line of\r\nnarrative; with no shadow of pretence to such interest as may be derived\r\nfrom stress of incident or depth of sentiment, it stands out among all\r\nother famous poems as a perfect and unsurpassable study in pure colour\r\nand clear melody--a study in which the figure of Madeline brings back\r\nupon the mind's eye, if only as moonlight recalls a sense of sunshine,\r\nthe nuptial picture of Marlowe's Hero and the sleeping presence of\r\nShakespeare's Imogen. Beside this poem should always be placed the less\r\nfamous but not less precious _Eve of St Mark_, a fragment unexcelled for\r\nthe simple perfection of its perfect simplicity, exquisite alike in\r\nsuggestion and in accomplishment. The triumph of _Hyperion_ is as nearly\r\ncomplete as the failure of _Endymion_; yet Keats never gave such proof\r\nof a manly devotion and rational sense of duty to his art as in his\r\nresolution to leave this great poem unfinished; not, as we may gather\r\nfrom his correspondence on the subject, for the pitiful reason assigned\r\nby his publishers, that of discouragement at the reception given to his\r\nformer work, but on the solid and reasonable ground that a Miltonic\r\nstudy had something in its very scheme and nature too artificial, too\r\nstudious of a foreign influence, to be carried on and carried out at\r\nsuch length as was implied by his original design. Fortified and\r\npurified as it had been on a first revision, when much introductory\r\nallegory and much tentative effusion of sonorous and superfluous verse\r\nhad been rigorously clipped down or pruned away, it could not long have\r\nretained spirit enough to support or inform the shadowy body of a\r\nsubject so little charged with tangible significance. The faculty of\r\nassimilation as distinguished from imitation, than which there can be no\r\nsurer or stronger sign of strong and sure original genius, is not more\r\nevident in the most Miltonic passages of the revised _Hyperion_ than in\r\nthe more Shakespearian passages of the unrevised tragedy which no\r\nradical correction could have left other than radically incorrigible. It\r\nis no conventional exaggeration, no hyperbolical phrase of flattery with\r\nmore sound than sense in it, to say that in this chaotic and puerile\r\nplay of _Otho the Great_ there are such verses as Shakespeare might not\r\nwithout pride have signed at the age when he wrote and even at the age\r\nwhen he rewrote the tragedy of _Romeo and Juliet_. The dramatic fragment\r\nof _King Stephen_ shows far more power of hand and gives far more\r\npromise of success than does that of Shelley's _Charles the First_. Yet\r\nwe cannot say with any confidence that even this far from extravagant\r\npromise would certainly or probably have been kept; it is certain only\r\nthat Keats in these attempts did at least succeed in showing a\r\npossibility of future excellence as a tragic or at least a romantic\r\ndramatist. In every other line of high and serious poetry his triumph\r\nwas actual and consummate; here only was it no more than potential or\r\nincomplete. As a ballad of the more lyrical order, _La Belle dame sans\r\nmerci_ is not less absolutely excellent, less triumphantly perfect in\r\nforce and clearness of impression, that as a narrative poem is _Lamia_.\r\nIn his lines on Robin Hood, and in one or two other less noticeable\r\nstudies of the kind, he has shown thorough and easy mastery of the\r\nbeautiful metre inherited by Fletcher from Barnfield and by Milton from\r\nFletcher. The simple force of spirit and style which distinguishes the\r\ngenuine ballad manner from all spurious attempts at an artificial\r\nsimplicity was once more at least achieved in his verses on the\r\ncrowning creation of Scott's humaner and manlier genius--Meg Merrilies.\r\nNo little injustice has been done to Keats by such devotees as fix their\r\nmind's eye only on the more salient and distinctive notes of a genius\r\nwhich in fact was very much more various and tentative, less limited and\r\npeculiar, than would be inferred from an exclusive study of his more\r\nspecially characteristic work. But within the limits of that work must\r\nwe look of course for the genuine credentials of his fame; and highest\r\namong them we must rate his unequalled and unrivalled odes. Of these\r\nperhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant\r\nachievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to\r\nhuman words, may be that to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn; the most\r\nradiant, fervent and musical is that to a Nightingale; the most\r\npictorial and perhaps the tenderest in its ardour of passionate fancy is\r\nthat to Psyche; the subtlest in sweetness of thought and feeling is that\r\non Melancholy. Greater lyrical poetry the world may have seen than any\r\nthat is in these; lovelier it surely has never seen, nor ever can it\r\npossibly see. From the divine fragment of an unfinished ode to Maia we\r\ncan but guess that if completed it would have been worthy of a place\r\nbeside the highest. His remaining lyrics have many beauties about them,\r\nbut none perhaps can be called thoroughly beautiful. He has certainly\r\nleft us one perfect sonnet of the first rank and as certainly he has\r\nleft us but one.\r\n\r\nKeats has been promoted by modern criticism to a place beside\r\nShakespeare. The faultless force and the profound subtlety of his deep\r\nand cunning instinct for the absolute expression of absolute natural\r\nbeauty can hardly be questioned or overlooked; and this is doubtless the\r\none main distinctive gift or power which denotes him as a poet among all\r\nhis equals, and gives him a right to rank for ever beside Coleridge and\r\nShelley. As a man, the two admirers who did best service to his memory\r\nwere Lord Houghton and Matthew Arnold. These alone, among all of their\r\nday who have written of him without the disadvantage or advantage of a\r\npersonal acquaintance, have clearly seen and shown us the manhood of the\r\nman. That ridiculous and degrading legend which imposed so strangely on\r\nthe generous tenderness of Shelley, while evoking the very natural and\r\nallowable laughter of Byron, fell to dust at once for ever on the\r\nappearance of Lord Houghton's biography, which gave perfect proof to all\r\ntime that \"men have died and worms have eaten them\" but not for fear of\r\ncritics or through suffering inflicted by reviews. Somewhat too\r\nsensually sensitive Keats may have been in either capacity, but the\r\nnature of the man was as far as was the quality of the poet above the\r\npitiful level of a creature whose soul could \"let itself be snuffed out\r\nby an article\"; and, in fact, owing doubtless to the accident of a death\r\nwhich followed so fast on his early appearance and his dubious reception\r\nas a poet, the insolence and injustice of his reviewers in general have\r\nbeen comparatively and even considerably exaggerated. Except from the\r\nchief fountain-head of professional ribaldry then open in the world of\r\nliterary journalism, no reek of personal insult arose to offend his\r\nnostrils; and the tactics of such unwashed malignants were inevitably\r\nsuicidal; the references to his brief experiment of apprenticeship to a\r\nsurgeon which are quoted from _Blackwood_, in the shorter as well as in\r\nthe longer memoir by Lord Houghton, could leave no bad odour behind them\r\nsave what might hang about men's yet briefer recollection of his\r\nassailant's unmemorable existence. The false Keats, therefore, whom\r\nShelley pitied and Byron despised would have been, had he ever existed,\r\na thing beneath compassion or contempt. That such a man could have had\r\nsuch a genius is almost evidently impossible; and yet more evident is\r\nthe proof which remains on everlasting record that none was ever further\r\nfrom the chance of decline to such degradation than the real and actual\r\nman who made that name immortal.     (A. C. S.)\r\n\r\nSubjoined are the chief particulars of Keats's life.\r\n\r\nHe was the eldest son of Thomas Keats and his wife Frances Jennings, and\r\nwas baptized at St Botolph's, Bishopsgate, on the 18th of December 1795.\r\nThe entry of his baptism is supplemented by a marginal note stating that\r\nhe was born on the 31st of October. Thomas Keats was employed in the\r\nSwan and Hoop livery stables, Finsbury Pavement, London. He had married\r\nhis master's daughter, and managed the business on the retirement of his\r\nfather-in-law. In April 1804 Thomas Keats was killed by a fall from his\r\nhorse, and within a year of this event Mrs Keats married William\r\nRawlings, a stable-keeper. The marriage proved an unhappy one, and in\r\n1806 Mrs Rawlings, with her children John, George, Thomas and Frances\r\nMary (afterwards Mrs Llanos, d. 1889), went to live at Edmonton with her\r\nmother, who had inherited a considerable competence from her husband.\r\nThere is evidence that Keats's parents were by no means of the\r\ncommonplace type that might be hastily inferred from these associations.\r\nThey had desired to send their sons to Harrow, but John Keats and his\r\ntwo brothers were eventually sent to a school kept by John Clarke at\r\nEnfield, where he became intimate with his master's son, Charles Cowden\r\nClarke. His vivacity of temperament showed itself at school in a love of\r\nfighting, but in the last year of his school life he developed a great\r\nappetite for reading of all sorts. In 1810 he left school to be\r\napprenticed to Mr Thomas Hammond, a surgeon in Edmonton. He was still\r\nwithin easy reach of his old school, where he frequently borrowed books,\r\nespecially the works of Spenser and the Elizabethans. With Hammond he\r\nquarrelled before the termination of his apprenticeship, and in 1814 the\r\nconnexion was broken by mutual consent. His mother had died in 1810, and\r\nin 1814 Mrs Jennings. The children were left in the care of two\r\nguardians, one of whom, Richard Abbey, seems to have made himself solely\r\nresponsible. John Keats went to London to study at Guy's and St Thomas's\r\nhospitals, living at first alone at 8 Dean Street, Borough, and later\r\nwith two fellow students in St Thomas's Street. It does not appear that\r\nhe neglected his medical studies, but his chief interest was turned to\r\npoetry. In March 1816 he became a dresser at Guy's, but about the same\r\ntime his poetic gifts were stimulated by an acquaintance formed with\r\nLeigh Hunt. His friendship with Benjamin Haydon, the painter, dates from\r\nlater in the same year. Hunt introduced him to Shelley, who showed the\r\nyounger poet a constant kindness. In 1816 Keats moved to the Poultry to\r\nbe with his brothers George and Tom, the former of whom was then\r\nemployed in his guardian's counting-house, but much of the poet's time\r\nwas spent at Leigh Hunt's cottage at Hampstead. In the winter of\r\n1816-1817 he definitely abandoned medicine, and in the spring appeared\r\n_Poems by John Keats_ dedicated to Leigh Hunt, and published by Charles\r\nand James Ollier. On the 14th of April he left London to find quiet for\r\nwork. He spent some time at Shanklin, Isle of Wight, then at Margate and\r\nCanterbury, where he was joined by his brother Tom. In the summer the\r\nthree brothers took lodgings in Well Walk, Hampstead, where Keats formed\r\na fast friendship with Charles Wentworth Dilke and Charles Armitage\r\nBrown. In September of the same year (1817) he paid a visit to his\r\nfriend, Benjamin Bailey, at Oxford, and in November he finished\r\n_Endymion_ at Burford Bridge, near Dorking. His youngest brother had\r\ndeveloped consumption, and in March John went to Teignmouth to nurse him\r\nin place of his brother George, who had decided to sail for America with\r\nhis newly married wife, Georgiana Wylie. In May (1818) Keats returned to\r\nLondon, and soon after appeared _Endymion: A Poetic Romance_ (1818),\r\nbearing on the title-page as motto \"The stretched metre of an antique\r\nsong.\" Late in June Keats and his friend Armitage Brown started on a\r\nwalking tour in Scotland, vividly described in the poet's letters. The\r\nfatigue and hardship involved proved too great a strain for Keats, who\r\nwas forbidden by an Inverness doctor to continue his tour. He returned\r\nto London by boat, arriving on the 18th of August. The autumn was spent\r\nin constant attendance on his brother Tom, who died at the beginning of\r\nDecember. There is no doubt that he resented the attacks on him in\r\n_Blackwood's Magazine_ (August 1818), and the _Quarterly Review_ (April\r\n1818, published only in September), but his chief preoccupations were\r\nelsewhere. After his brother's death he went to live with his friend\r\nBrown. He had already made the acquaintance of Fanny Brawne, a girl of\r\nseventeen, who lived with her mother close by. For her Keats quickly\r\ndeveloped a consuming passion. He was in indifferent health, and, owing\r\npartly to Mr Abbey's mismanagement, in difficulties for money.\r\nNevertheless his best work belongs to this period. In July 1819 he went\r\nto Shanklin, living with James Rice. They were soon joined by Brown. The\r\nnext two months Keats spent with Brown at Winchester, enjoying an\r\ninterval of calmness due to his absence from Fanny Brawne. At Winchester\r\nhe completed _Lamia_ and _Otho the Great_, which he had begun in\r\nconjunction with Brown, and began his historical tragedy of _King\r\nStephen_. Before Christmas he had returned to London and his bondage to\r\nFanny. In January 1820 his brother George paid a short visit to London,\r\nbut received no confidence from him. The fatal nature of Keats's illness\r\nshowed itself on the 3rd of February, but in March he recovered\r\nsufficiently to be present at the private view of Haydon's picture of\r\n\"Christ's Entry into Jerusalem.\" In May he removed to a lodging in\r\nWesleyan Place, Kentish Town, to be near Leigh Hunt who eventually took\r\nhim into his house. In July appeared his third and last book, _Lamia,\r\nIsabella, The Eve of St Agnes and other Poems_ (1820). Keats left the\r\nHunts abruptly in August in consequence of a delay in receiving one of\r\nFanny Brawne's letters which had been broken open by a servant. He went\r\nto Wentworth Place, where he was taken in by the Brawnes. The suggestion\r\nthat he should spend the winter in Italy was followed up by an\r\ninvitation from Shelley to Pisa. This, however, he refused. But on the\r\n18th of September 1820 he set out for Naples in company with Joseph\r\nSevern, the artist, who had long been his friend. The travellers settled\r\nin the Piazza de Spagna, Rome. Keats was devotedly tended by Dr\r\n(afterwards Sir) James Clarke and Severn, and died on the 23rd of\r\nFebruary 1821. He was buried on the 27th in the old Protestant cemetery,\r\nnear the pyramid of Cestius.\r\n\r\n  Bibliography.--Keats's friends provided the material for the\r\n  authoritative biography of the poet by Richard Monckton Milnes\r\n  (afterwards Lord Houghton) entitled _Life, Letters and Literary\r\n  Remains of John Keats_ (1848; revised ed., 1867). _The Poetical Works\r\n  of John Keats_ were issued with a memoir by R. M. Milnes in 1854,\r\n  1863, 1865, 1866, 1867, and in the Aldine edition, 1876. The standard\r\n  edition of Keats is _The Poetical Works and other Writings of John\r\n  Keats now first brought together, including Poems and numerous Letters\r\n  not before published, edited with notes and appendices_ by Harry\r\n  Buxton Forman (4 vols., 1883; re-issue with corrections and additions,\r\n  1889). Of the many other editions of Keats's poems may be mentioned\r\n  that in the Muses' Library, _The Poems of John Keats_ (1896), edited\r\n  by G. Thorn Drury with an introduction by Robert Bridges, and another\r\n  by E. de Selincourt, 1905. _The Letters of John Keats to Fanny Brawne_\r\n  (1889) were edited with introduction and notes by H. Buxton Forman,\r\n  and the _Letters of John Keats to his Family and Friends_ (1891) by\r\n  Sidney Colvin, who is also the author of the monograph, _Keats_\r\n  (1887), in the English Men of Letters Series. See also _The Papers of\r\n  a Critic. Selected from the Writings of the late Charles Wentworth\r\n  Dilke_ (1875), and for further bibliographical information and\r\n  particulars of MS. sources the \"Editor's Preface,\" &c. to a reprint\r\n  edited by H. Buxton Forman (Glasgow, 1900). A facsimile of Keats's\r\n  autograph MS. of \"Hyperion,\" purchased by the British Museum in 1904,\r\n  was published by E. de Selincourt (Oxford, 1905).     (M. Br.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEBLE, JOHN (1792-1866), English poet and divine, the author of the\r\n_Christian Year_, was born on St Mark's Day (April 25), 1792, at\r\nFairford, Gloucestershire. He was the second child of the Rev. John\r\nKeble and his wife Sarah Maule. Descended from a family which had\r\nattained some legal eminence in the time of the Commonwealth, John\r\nKeble, the father of the poet, was vicar of Coln St Aldwyn, but lived at\r\nFairford, about 3 m. distant from his cure. He was a clergyman of the\r\nold High Church school, whose adherents, untouched by the influence of\r\nthe Wesleys, had moulded their piety on the doctrines on the non-jurors\r\nand the old Anglican divines. Himself a good scholar, he did not send\r\nhis son to any school, but educated him and his brother at home so well\r\nthat both obtained scholarships at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. John\r\nwas elected scholar of Corpus in his fifteenth, and fellow of Oriel in\r\nhis nineteenth year, April 1811. In Easter term 1810 he had obtained\r\ndouble first class honours, a distinction which had been obtained only\r\nonce before, by Sir Robert Peel. After his election to the Oriel\r\nfellowship Keble gained the University prizes, both for the English\r\nessay and also for the Latin essay. But he was more remarkable for the\r\nrare beauty of his character than even for academic distinctions. Sir\r\nJohn Taylor Coleridge, his fellow scholar at Corpus and his life-long\r\nfriend, says of him, after their friendship of five and fifty years had\r\nclosed, \"It was the singular happiness of his nature, remarkable even in\r\nhis undergraduate days, that love for him was always sanctified by\r\nreverence--reverence that did not make the love less tender, and love\r\nthat did but add intensity to the reverence.\" Oriel College was, at the\r\ntime when Keble became a fellow, the centre of all the finest ability in\r\nOxford. Copleston, Davison, Whately, were among the fellows who elected\r\nKeble; Arnold, Pusey, Newman, were soon after added to the society. In\r\n1815 Keble was ordained deacon, and priest in 1816. His real bent and\r\nchoice were towards a pastoral cure in a country parish; but he remained\r\nin Oxford, acting first as a public examiner in the schools, then as a\r\ntutor in Oriel, till 1823. In summer he sometimes took clerical work,\r\nsometimes made tours on foot through various English counties, during\r\nwhich he was composing poems, which afterwards took their place in the\r\n_Christian Year_. He had a rare power of attracting to himself the\r\nfinest spirits, a power which lay not so much in his ability or his\r\ngenius as in his character, so simple, so humble, so pure, so unworldly,\r\nyet wanting not that severity which can stand by principle and maintain\r\nwhat he holds to be the truth. In 1823 he returned to Fairford, there to\r\nassist his father, and with his brother to serve one or two small and\r\npoorly endowed curacies in the neighbourhood of Coln. He had made a\r\nquiet but deep impression on all who came within his influence in\r\nOxford, and during his five years of college tutorship had won the\r\naffection of his pupils. But it was to pastoral work, and not to\r\nacademic duty, that he thenceforth devoted himself, associating with it,\r\nand scarcely placing on a lower level, the affectionate discharge of his\r\nduties as a son and brother. Filial piety influenced in a quite unusual\r\ndegree his feelings and his action all life through. It was in 1827, a\r\nfew years after he settled at Fairford, that he published the _Christian\r\nYear_. The poems which make up that book had been the silent gathering\r\nof years. Keble had purposed in his own mind to keep them beside him,\r\ncorrecting and improving them, as long as he lived, and to leave them to\r\nbe published only \"when he was fairly out of the way.\" This resolution\r\nwas at length overcome by the importunities of his friends, and above\r\nall by the strong desire of his father to see his son's poems in print\r\nbefore he died. Accordingly they were printed in two small volumes in\r\nOxford, and given to the world in June 1827, but with no name on the\r\ntitle-page. The book continued to be published anonymously, but the name\r\nof the author soon transpired.\r\n\r\nBetween 1827 and 1872 one hundred and fifty-eight editions had issued\r\nfrom the press, and it has been largely reprinted since. The author, so\r\nfar from taking pride in his widespread reputation, seemed all his life\r\nlong to wish to disconnect his name with the book, and \"as if he would\r\nrather it had been the work of some one else than himself.\" This feeling\r\narose from no false modesty. It was because he knew that in these poems\r\nhe had painted his own heart, the best part of it; and he doubted\r\nwhether it was right thus to exhibit himself, and by the revelation of\r\nonly his better self, to win the good opinion of the world.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1831 Keble was elected to fill the chair of the\r\npoetry professorship in Oxford, as successor to his friend and admirer,\r\nDean Milman. This chair he occupied for ten eventful years. He delivered\r\na series of lectures, clothed in excellent idiomatic Latin (as was the\r\nrule), in which he expounded a theory of poetry which was original and\r\nsuggestive. He looked on poetry as a vent for overcharged feeling, or a\r\nfull imagination, or some imaginative regret, which had not found their\r\nnatural outlet in life and action. This suggested to him a distinction\r\nbetween what he called primary and secondary poets--the first employing\r\npoetry to relieve their own hearts, the second, poetic artists,\r\ncomposing poetry from some other and less impulsive motive. Of the\r\nformer kind were Homer, Lucretius, Burns, Scott; of the latter were\r\nEuripides, Dryden, Milton. This view was set forth in an article\r\ncontributed to the _British Critic_ in 1838 on the life of Scott, and\r\nwas more fully developed in two volumes of _Praelectiones Academicae_.\r\n\r\nHis regular visits to Oxford kept him in intercourse with his old\r\nfriends in Oriel common room, and made him familiar with the currents of\r\nfeeling which swayed the university. Catholic emancipation and the\r\nReform Bill had deeply stirred, not only the political spirit of Oxford,\r\nbut also the church feeling which had long been stagnant. Cardinal\r\nNewman writes, \"On Sunday July 14, 1833, Mr Keble preached the assize\r\nsermon in the University pulpit. It was published under the title of\r\n_National Apostasy_. I have ever considered and kept the day as the\r\nstart of the religious movement of 1833.\" The occasion of this sermon\r\nwas the suppression, by Earl Grey's Reform ministry, of ten Irish\r\nbishoprics. Against the spirit which would treat the church as the mere\r\ncreature of the state Keble had long chafed inwardly, and now he made\r\nhis outward protest, asserting the claim of the church to a heavenly\r\norigin and a divine prerogative. About the same time, and partly\r\nstimulated by Keble's sermon, some leading spirits in Oxford and\r\nelsewhere began a concerted and systematic course of action to revive\r\nHigh Church principles and the ancient patristic theology, and by these\r\nmeans both to defend the church against the assaults of its enemies, and\r\nalso to raise to a higher tone the standard of Christian life in\r\nEngland. This design embodied itself in the Tractarian movement, a name\r\nit received from the famous _Tracts for the Times_, which were the\r\nvehicle for promulgating the new doctrines. If Keble is to be reckoned,\r\nas Newman would have it, as the primary author of the movement, it was\r\nfrom Pusey that it received one of its best known names, and in Newman\r\nthat it soon found its genuine leader. To the tracts Keble made only\r\nfour contributions:--No. 4, containing an argument, in the manner of\r\nBishop Butler, to show that adherence to apostolical succession is the\r\nsafest course; No. 13, which explains the principle on which the Sunday\r\nlessons in the church service are selected; No. 40, on marriage with one\r\nwho is unbaptized; No. 89, on the mysticism attributed to the early\r\nfathers of the church. Besides these contributions from his own pen, he\r\ndid much for the series by suggesting subjects, by reviewing tracts\r\nwritten by others, and by lending to their circulation the weight of his\r\npersonal influence.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Keble's father died at the age of ninety, and soon after this\r\nhis son married Miss Clarke, left Fairford, and settled at Hursley\r\nvicarage in Hampshire, a living to which he had been presented by his\r\nfriend and attached pupil, Sir William Heathcote, and which continued to\r\nbe Keble's home and cure for the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the tracts were brought to an abrupt termination by the\r\npublication of Newman's tract No. 90. All the Protestantism of England\r\nwas in arms against the author of the obnoxious tract. Keble came\r\nforward at the time, desirous to share the responsibility and the blame,\r\nif there was any; for he had seen the tract before it was published, and\r\napproved it. The same year in which burst this ecclesiastical storm saw\r\nthe close of Keble's tenure of the professorship of poetry, and\r\nthenceforward he was seen but rarely in Oxford. No other public event\r\never affected Keble so deeply as the secession of Newman to the Church\r\nof Rome in 1845. It was to him both a public and a private sorrow, which\r\nnothing could repair. But he did not lose heart; at once he threw\r\nhimself into the double duty, which now devolved on himself and Pusey,\r\nof counselling the many who had hitherto followed the movement, and who,\r\nnow in their perplexity, might be tempted to follow their leader's\r\nexample, and at the same time of maintaining the rights of the church\r\nagainst what he held to be the encroachments of the state, as seen in\r\nsuch acts as the Gorham judgment, and the decision on _Essays and\r\nReviews_. In all the ecclesiastical contests of the twenty years which\r\nfollowed 1845, Keble took a part, not loud or obtrusive, but firm and\r\nresolute, in maintaining those High Anglican principles with which his\r\nlife had been identified. These absorbing duties, added to his parochial\r\nwork, left little time for literature. But in 1846 he published the\r\n_Lyra Innocentium_; and in 1863 he completed a life of Bishop Wilson.\r\n\r\nIn the late autumn of the latter year, Keble left Hursley for the sake\r\nof his wife's health, and sought the milder climate of Bournemouth.\r\nThere he had an attack of paralysis, from which he died on the 29th of\r\nMarch 1866. He was buried in his own churchyard at Hursley; and in\r\nlittle more than a month his wife was laid by her husband's side.\r\n\r\n  Keble also published _A Metrical Version of the Psalter_ (1839), _Lyra\r\n  Innocentium_ (1846), and a volume of poems was published posthumously.\r\n  But it is by the _Christian Year_ that he won the ear of the religious\r\n  world. It was a happy thought that dictated the plan of the book, to\r\n  furnish a meditative religious lyric for each Sunday of the year, and\r\n  for each saint's day and festival of the English Church. The subject\r\n  of each poem is generally suggested by some part of the lessons or the\r\n  gospel or the epistle for the day. One thing which gives these poems\r\n  their strangely unique power is the sentiment to which they appeal,\r\n  and the saintly character of the poet who makes the appeal, illumining\r\n  more or less every poem.\r\n\r\n  The intimacy with the Bible which is manifest in the pages of the\r\n  _Christian Year_; and the unobtrusive felicity with which Biblical\r\n  sentiments and language are introduced have done much to endear these\r\n  poems to all Bible readers. \"The exactness of the descriptions of\r\n  Palestine, which Keble had never visited, have been noted, and\r\n  verified on the spot,\" by Dean Stanley. He points to features of the\r\n  lake of Gennesareth, which were first touched in the _Christian Year_;\r\n  and he observes that throughout the book \"the Biblical scenery is\r\n  treated graphically as real scenery, and the Biblical history and\r\n  poetry as real history and poetry.\"\r\n\r\n  As to its style, the _Christian Year_ is calm and grave in tone, and\r\n  subdued in colour, as beseems its subjects and sentiments. The\r\n  contemporary poets whom Keble most admired were Scott, Wordsworth and\r\n  Southey; and of their influence traces are visible in his diction. Yet\r\n  he has a style of language and a cadence of his own, which steal into\r\n  the heart with strangely soothing power. Some of the poems are\r\n  faultless, after their kind, flowing from the first stage to the last,\r\n  lucid in thought, vivid in diction, harmonious in their pensive\r\n  melody. In others there are imperfections in rhythm, conventionalities\r\n  of language, obscurities or over-subtleties of thought, which mar the\r\n  reader's enjoyment. Yet even the most defective poems commonly have,\r\n  at least, a single verse, expressing some profound thought or tender\r\n  shade of feeling, for which the sympathetic reader willingly pardons\r\n  artistic imperfections in the rest.\r\n\r\n  Keble's life was written by his life-long friend Mr Justice J. T.\r\n  Coleridge. The following is a complete list of his writings:--1. Works\r\n  published in Keble's lifetime: _Christian Year_ (1827); _Psalter_\r\n  (1839); _Praelectiones Academicae_ (1844); _Lyra Innocentium_ (1846);\r\n  _Sermons Academical_ (1848); _Argument against Repeal of Marriage\r\n  Law_, and _Sequel_ (1857); _Eucharistical Adoration_ (1857); _Life of\r\n  Bishop Wilson_ (1863); _Sermons Occasional and Parochial_ (1867). 2.\r\n  Posthumous publications: _Village Sermons on the Baptismal Service_\r\n  (1868); _Miscellaneous Poems_ (1869); _Letters of Spiritual Counsel_\r\n  (1870); _Sermons for the Christian Year, &c._ (11 vols., 1875-1880);\r\n  _Occasional Papers and Reviews_ (1877); _Studia Sacra_ (1877);\r\n  _Outlines of Instruction or Meditation_ (1880).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKECSKEMET, a town of Hungary, in the county of Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun,\r\n65 m. S.S.E. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900), 56,786. Kecskemet is a\r\npoorly built and straggling town, situated in the extensive Kecskemet\r\nplain. It contains monasteries belonging to the Piarist and Franciscan\r\norders, a Catholic (founded in 1714), a Calvinistic and a Lutheran\r\nschool. The manufacture of soap and leather are the principal\r\nindustries. Besides the raising of cereals, fruit is extensively\r\ncultivated in the surrounding district; its apples and apricots are\r\nlargely exported, large quantities of wine are produced, and\r\ncattle-rearing constitutes another great source of revenue. Kecskemet\r\nwas the birthplace of the Hungarian dramatist Jozsef Katona (1792-1830),\r\nauthor of the historical drama, _Bank-Ban_ (1815).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEDDAH (from Hindu _Khedna_, to chase), the term, used in India for the\r\nenclosure constructed to entrap elephants. In Ceylon the word employed\r\nin the same meaning is _corral_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEDGEREE (Hindostani, _khichri_), an Indian dish, composed of boiled\r\nrice and various highly-flavoured ingredients. Kedgeree is of two kinds,\r\nwhite and yellow. The white is made with grain, onions, ghee (clarified\r\nbutter), cloves, pepper and salt. Yellow kedgeree includes eggs, and is\r\ncoloured by turmeric. Kedgeree is a favourite and universal dish in\r\nIndia; among the poorer classes it is frequently made of rice and pulse\r\nonly, or rice and beans. In European cookery kedgeree is a similar dish\r\nusually made with fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEL, the bottom timber or combination of plates of a ship or boat,\r\nextending longitudinally from bow to stern, and supporting the framework\r\n(see SHIP-BUILDING). The origin of the word has been obscured by\r\nconfusion of two words, the Old Norwegian _kjole_ (cf. Swedish _kol_)\r\nand a Dutch and German _kiel_. The first had the meaning of the English\r\n\"keel,\" the other of ship, boat. The modern usage in Dutch and German\r\nhas approximated to the English. The word _kiel_ is represented in old\r\nEnglish by _ceol_, a word applied to the long war galleys of the\r\nVikings, in which sense \"keel\" or \"keele\" is still used by\r\narchaeologists. On the Tyne \"keel\" is the name given to a flat-bottomed\r\nvessel used to carry coals to the colliers. There is another word\r\n\"keel,\" meaning to cool, familiar in Shakespeare (_Love's Labour Lost_,\r\nv. ii. 930), \"while greasy Joan doth keel the pot,\" i.e. prevents a pot\r\nfrom boiling over by pouring in cold water, &c., stirring or skimming.\r\nThis is from the Old English _celan_, to cool, a common Teutonic word,\r\ncf. German _kuhlen_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEELEY, MARY ANNE (1806-1899), English actress, was born at Ipswich on\r\nthe 22nd of November 1805 or 1806. Her maiden name was Goward, her\r\nfather being a brazier and tinman. After some experience in the\r\nprovinces, she first appeared on the stage in London on the 2nd of July\r\n1825, in the opera _Rosina_. It was not long before she gave up \"singing\r\nparts\" in favour of the drama proper, where her powers of\r\ncharacter-acting could have scope. In June 1829 she married Robert\r\nKeeley (1793-1869), an admirable comedian, with whom she had often\r\nappeared. Between 1832 and 1842 they acted at Covent Garden, at the\r\nAdelphi with Buckstone, at the Olympic with Charles Mathews, and at\r\nDrury Lane with Macready. In 1836 they visited America. In 1838 she made\r\nher first great success as Nydia, the blind girl, in a dramatized\r\nversion of Bulwer Lytton's _The Last Days of Pompeii_, and followed this\r\nwith an equally striking impersonation of Smike in _Nicholas Nickleby_.\r\nIn 1839 came her decisive triumph with her picturesque and spirited\r\nacting as the hero of a play founded upon Harrison Ainsworth's _Jack\r\nSheppard_. So dangerous was considered the popularity of the play, with\r\nits glorification of the prison-breaking felon, that the lord\r\nchamberlain ultimately forbade the performance of any piece upon the\r\nsubject. It is perhaps mainly as Jack Sheppard that Mrs Keeley lived in\r\nthe memory of playgoers, despite her long subsequent career in plays\r\nmore worthy of her remarkable gifts. Under Macready's management she\r\nplayed Nerissa in _The Merchant of Venice_, and Audrey in _As You Like\r\nIt_. She managed the Lyceum with her husband from 1844 to 1847; acted\r\nwith Webster and Kean at the Haymarket; returned for five years to the\r\nAdelphi; and made her last regular public appearance at the Lyceum in\r\n1859. A public reception was given her at this theatre on her 90th\r\nbirthday. She died on the 12th of March 1899.\r\n\r\n  See Walter Goodman, _The Keeleys on the Stage and off_ (London, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEELING ISLANDS (often called COCOS and COCOS-KEELING ISLANDS), a group\r\nof coral islands in the Indian Ocean, between 12 deg. 4' and 12 deg. 13'\r\nS., and 96 deg. 49'-57' E., but including a smaller island in 11 deg.\r\n50' N. and 96 deg. 50' E. The group furnished Charles Darwin with the\r\ntypical example of an atoll or lagoon island. There are altogether\r\ntwenty-three small islands, 9(1/2) m. being the greatest width of the\r\nwhole atoll. The lagoon is very shallow and the passages between many of\r\nthe islands are fordable on foot. An opening on the northern side of the\r\nreef permits the entrance of vessels into the northern part of the\r\nlagoon, which forms a good harbour known as Port Refuge or Port Albion.\r\nThe coco-nut (as the name Cocos Islands indicates) is the characteristic\r\nproduct and is cultivated on all the islands. The flora is scanty in\r\nspecies. One of the commonest living creatures is a monstrous crab which\r\nlives on the coco-nuts; and in some places also there are great colonies\r\nof the pomegranate crab. The group was visited by Dr H. O. Forbes in\r\n1878, and later, at the expense of Sir John Murray, by Dr Guppy, Mr\r\nRidley and Dr Andrews. The object of their visits was the investigation\r\nof the fauna and flora of the atoll, more especially of the formation of\r\nthe coral reefs. Dr Guppy was fortunate in reaching North Keeling\r\nIsland, where a landing is only possible during the calmest weather. The\r\nisland he found to be about a mile long, with a shallow enclosed lagoon,\r\nless than 3 ft. deep at ordinary low water, with a single opening on its\r\neast or weather side. A dense vegetation of iron-wood (_Cordia_) and\r\nother trees and shrubs, together with a forest of coco-nut palms, covers\r\nits surface. It is tenanted by myriads of sea-fowl, frigate-birds,\r\nboobies, and terns (_Gygis candida_), which find here an excellent\r\nnesting-place, for the island is uninhabited, and is visited only once\r\nor twice a year. The excrement from this large colony has changed the\r\ncarbonate of lime in the soil and the coral nodules on the surface into\r\nphosphates, to the extent in some cases of 60-70%, thus forming a\r\nvaluable deposit, beneficial to the vegetation of the island itself and\r\npromising commercial value. The lagoon is slowly filling up and becoming\r\ncultivable land, but the rate of recovery from the sea has been\r\nspecially marked since the eruption of Krakatoa, the pumice from which\r\nwas washed on to it in enormous quantity, so that the lagoon advanced\r\nits shores from 20 to 30 yards. Forbes's and Guppy's investigations go\r\nto show that, contrary to Darwin's belief, there is no evidence of\r\nupheaval or of subsidence in either of the Keeling groups.\r\n\r\nThe atoll has an exceedingly healthy climate, and might well be used as\r\na sanatorium for phthisical patients, the temperature never reaching\r\nextremes. The highest annual reading of the thermometer hardly ever\r\nexceeds 89 deg. F. or falls beneath 70 deg. The mean temperature for the\r\nyear is 78.5 deg. F., and as the rainfall rarely exceeds 40 in. the\r\natmosphere never becomes unpleasantly moist. The south-east trade blows\r\nalmost ceaselessly for ten months of the year. Terrific storms sometimes\r\nbreak over the island; and it has been more than once visited by\r\nearthquakes. A profitable trade is done in coco-nuts, but there are few\r\nother exports. The imports are almost entirely foodstuffs and other\r\nnecessaries for the inhabitants, who form a patriarchal colony under a\r\nprivate proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe islands were discovered in 1609 by Captain William Keeling on his\r\nvoyage from Batavia to the Cape. In 1823 Alexander Hare, an English\r\nadventurer, settled on the southernmost island with a number of slaves.\r\nSome two or three years after, a Scotchman, J. Ross, who had commanded a\r\nbrig during the English occupation of Java, settled with his family (who\r\ncontinued in the ownership) on Direction Island, and his little colony\r\nwas soon strengthened by Hare's runaway slaves. The Dutch Government had\r\nin an informal way claimed the possession of the islands since 1829; but\r\nthey refused to allow Ross to hoist the Dutch flag, and accordingly the\r\ngroup was taken under British protection in 1856. In 1878 it was\r\nattached to the government of Ceylon, and in 1882 placed under the\r\nauthority of the governor of the Straits Settlements. The ownership and\r\nsuperintendency continued in the Ross family, of whom George Clunies\r\nRoss died in 1910, and was succeeded by his son Sydney.\r\n\r\n  See C.

It is common in the Early\r\nEnglish and Decorated styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEENE, CHARLES SAMUEL (1823-1891), English black-and-white artist, the\r\nson of Samuel Browne Keene, a solicitor, was born at Hornsey on the 10th\r\nof August 1823. Educated at the Ipswich Grammar School until his\r\nsixteenth year, he early showed artistic leanings. Two years after the\r\ndeath of his father he was articled to a London solicitor, but, the\r\noccupation proving uncongenial, he was removed to the office of an\r\narchitect, Mr Pilkington. His spare time was now spent in drawing\r\nhistorical and nautical subjects in water-colour. For these trifles his\r\nmother, to whose energy and common sense he was greatly indebted, soon\r\nfound a purchaser, through whom he was brought to the notice of the\r\nWhympers, the wood-engravers. This led to his being bound to them as\r\napprentice for five years. His earliest known design is the\r\nfrontispiece, signed \"Chas. Keene,\" to _The Adventures of Dick Boldhero\r\nin Search of his Uncle_, &c. (Darton & Co., 1842). His term of\r\napprenticeship over, he hired as studio an attic in the block of\r\nbuildings standing, up to 1900, between the Strand and Holywell Street,\r\nand was soon hard at work for the _Illustrated London News_. At this\r\ntime he was a member of the \"Artists' Society\" in Clipstone Street,\r\nafterwards removed to the Langham studios. In December 1851 he made his\r\nfirst appearance in _Punch_ and, after nine years of steady work, was\r\ncalled to a seat at the famous table. It was during this period of\r\nprobation that he first gave evidence of those transcendent qualities\r\nwhich make his work at once the joy and despair of his brother\r\ncraftsmen. On the starting of _Once a Week_, in 1859, Keene's services\r\nwere requisitioned, his most notable series in this periodical being the\r\nillustrations to Charles Reade's _A Good Fight_ (afterwards rechristened\r\n_The Cloister and the Hearth_) and to George Meredith's _Evan\r\nHarrington_. There is a quality of conventionality in the earlier of\r\nthese which completely disappears in the later. In 1858 Keene, who was\r\nendowed with a fine voice and was an enthusiastic admirer of\r\nold-fashioned music, joined the \"Jermyn Band,\" afterwards better known\r\nas the \"Moray Minstrels.\" He was also for many years a member of\r\nLeslie's Choir, the Sacred Harmonic Society, the Catch, Glee and Canon\r\nClub, and the Bach Choir. He was also an industrious performer on the\r\nbagpipes, of which instrument he brought together a considerable\r\ncollection of specimens. About 1863 the Arts Club in Hanover Square was\r\nstarted, with Keene as one of the original members. In 1864 John Leech\r\ndied, and Keene's work in _Punch_ thenceforward found wider\r\nopportunities. It was about this time that the greatest of all modern\r\nartists of his class, Menzel, discovered Keene's existence, and became a\r\nsubscriber to _Punch_ solely for the sake of enjoying week by week the\r\nwork of his brother craftsman. In 1872 Keene, who, though fully\r\npossessed of the humorous sense, was not within measurable distance of\r\nLeech as a jester, and whose drawings were consequently not sufficiently\r\n\"funny\" to appeal to the laughter-loving public, was fortunate enough to\r\nmake the acquaintance of Mr Joseph Crawhall, who had been in the habit\r\nfor many years of jotting down any humorous incidents he might hear of\r\nor observe, illustrating them at leisure for his own amusement. These\r\nwere placed unreservedly at Keene's disposal, and to their inspiration\r\nwe owe at least 250 of his most successful drawings in the last twenty\r\nyears of his connexion with _Punch_. A list of more than 200 of these\r\nsubjects is given at the end of _The Life and Letters of Charles Keene\r\nof \"Punch.\"_ In 1879 Keene removed to 239 King's Road, Chelsea, which he\r\noccupied until his last illness, walking daily to and from his house,\r\n112 Hammersmith Road. In 1881 a volume of his _Punch_ drawings was\r\npublished by Messrs Bradbury & Agnew, with the title _Our People_. In\r\n1883 Keene, who had hitherto been a strong man, developed symptoms of\r\ndyspepsia and rheumatism. By 1889 these had increased to an alarming\r\ndegree, and the last two years of his life were passed in acute\r\nsuffering borne with the greatest courage. He died unmarried, after a\r\nsingularly uneventful life, on the 4th of January 1891, and his body\r\nlies in Hammersmith cemetery.\r\n\r\n  Keene, who never had any regular art training, was essentially an\r\n  artists' artist. He holds the foremost place amongst English craftsmen\r\n  in black and white, though his work has never been appreciated at its\r\n  real value by the general public. No doubt the main reason for this\r\n  lack of public recognition was his unconventionality. He drew his\r\n  models exactly as he saw them, not as he knew the world wanted to see\r\n  them. He found enough beauty and romance in all that was around him,\r\n  and, in his _Punch_ work, enough subtle humour in nature seized at her\r\n  most humorous moments to satisfy him. He never required his models to\r\n  grin through a horse collar, as Gillray did, or to put on their\r\n  company manners, as was du Maurier's wont. But Keene was not only a\r\n  brilliant worker in pen and ink. As an etcher he has also to be\r\n  reckoned with, notwithstanding the fact that his plates numbered not\r\n  more than fifty at the outside. Impressions of them are exceedingly\r\n  rare, and hardly half a dozen of the plates are now known to be in\r\n  existence. He himself regarded them only as experiments in a difficult\r\n  but fascinating medium. But in the opinion of the expert they suffice\r\n  to place him among the best etchers of the 19th century. Apart from\r\n  the etched frontispieces to some of the _Punch_ pocket-books, only\r\n  three, and these by no means the best, have been published. Writing\r\n  in _L'Artiste_ for May 1891 of a few which he had seen, Bracquemond\r\n  says: \"By the freedom, the largeness of their drawing and execution,\r\n  these plates must be classed amongst modern etchings of the first\r\n  rank.\" A few impressions are in the British Museum, but in the main\r\n  they were given away to friends and lie hidden in the albums of the\r\n  collector.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--G.

In 1851, in London, she\r\nwas playing Pauline in _The Lady of Lyons_. She made her first\r\nappearance in New York on the 20th of September 1852, on her way to\r\nAustralia. She returned in 1855 and till 1863 managed Laura Keene's\r\ntheatre, in which was produced, in 1858, _Our American Cousin_. It was\r\nher company that was playing at Ford's theatre, Washington, on the night\r\nof Lincoln's assassination. Miss Keene was a successful melodramatic\r\nactress, and an admirable manager. She died at Montclair, New Jersey, on\r\nthe 4th of November 1873.\r\n\r\n  See John Creahan's _Life of Laura Keene_ (1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEENE, a city and the county-seat of Cheshire county, New Hampshire,\r\nU.S.A., on the Ashuelot river, about 45 m. S.W. of Concord, N.H., and\r\nabout 92 m. W.N.W. of Boston. Pop. (1900), 9165, of whom 1255 were\r\nforeign-born; (1910 census), 10,068. Area, 36.5 sq. m. It is served by\r\nthe Boston & Maine railroad and by the Fitchburg railroad (leased by the\r\nBoston & Maine). The site is level, but is surrounded by ranges of lofty\r\nhills--Monadnock Mountain is about 10 m. S.E. Most of the streets are\r\npleasantly shaded. There are three parks, with a total area of about 219\r\nacres; and in Central Square stands a soldiers' and sailors' monument\r\ndesigned by Martin Milmore and erected in 1871. The principal buildings\r\nare the city hall, the county buildings and the city hospital. The\r\nPublic Library had in 1908 about 16,300 volumes. There are repair shops\r\nof the Boston & Maine railroad here, and manufactures of boots and\r\nshoes, woollen goods, furniture (especially chairs), pottery, &c. The\r\nvalue of the factory product in 1905 was $2,690,967. The site of Keene\r\nwas one of the Massachusetts grants made in 1733, but Canadian Indians\r\nmade it untenable and it was abandoned from 1746 until 1750. In 1753 it\r\nwas incorporated and was named Keene, in honour of Sir Benjamin Keene\r\n(1697-1757), the English diplomatist, who as agent for the South Sea\r\nCompany and Minister in Madrid, and as responsible for the commercial\r\ntreaty between England and Spain in 1750, was in high reputation at the\r\ntime; it was chartered as a city in 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP, ROBERT PORTER (1844-1904), American scholar, was born in\r\nFarmington, Connecticut, on the 26th of April 1844. He graduated at Yale\r\nin 1865, was instructor there for two years, was United States consul at\r\nthe Piraeus in Greece in 1869-1871, taught Greek in Williston Seminary,\r\nEasthampton, Massachusetts, in 1876-1885, and was principal of Norwich\r\nFree Academy, Norwich, Conn., from 1885 to 1903, the school owing its\r\nprosperity to him hardly less than to its founders. In 1903 he took\r\ncharge of Miss Porter's school for girls at Farmington, Conn., founded\r\nin 1844 and long controlled by his aunt, Sarah Porter. He died in\r\nFarmington on the 3rd of June 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP (corresponding to the French _donjon_), in architecture the inmost\r\nand strongest part of a medieval castle, answering to the citadel of\r\nmodern times. The arrangement is said to have originated with Gundulf,\r\nbishop of Rochester (d. 1108), architect of the White Tower. The Norman\r\nkeep is generally a very massive square tower. There is generally a well\r\nin a medieval keep, ingeniously concealed in the thickness of a wall or\r\nin a pillar. The most celebrated keeps of Norman times in England are\r\nthe White Tower in London, those at Rochester Arundel and Newcastle,\r\nCastle Hedingham, &c. When the keep was circular, as at Conisborough and\r\nWindsor, it was called a \"shell-keep\" (see CASTLE). The verb \"to keep,\"\r\nfrom which the noun with its particular meaning here treated was formed,\r\nappears in O.E. as _cepan_, of which the derivation is unknown; no words\r\nrelated to it are found in cognate languages. The earliest meaning (c.\r\n1000) appears to have been to lay hold of, to seize, from which its\r\ncommon uses of to guard, observe, retain possession of, have developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEWATIN, a district of Canada, bounded E. by Committee Bay, Fox\r\nChannel, and Hudson and James bays, S. and S.W. by the Albany and\r\nEnglish rivers, Manitoba, Lake Winnipeg, and Nelson river, W. by the\r\n100th meridian, and N. by Simpson and Rae straits and gulf and peninsula\r\nof Boothia; thus including an area of 445,000 sq. m. Its surface is in\r\ngeneral barren and rocky, studded with innumerable lakes with\r\nintervening elevations, forest-clad below 60 deg. N., but usually bare\r\nor covered with moss or lichens, forming the so-called \"barren lands\" of\r\nthe north. With the exception of a strip of Silurian and Devonian rocks,\r\n40 to 80 m. wide, extending from the vicinity of the Severn river to the\r\nChurchill, and several isolated areas of Cambrian and Huronian, the\r\ndistrict is occupied by Laurentian rocks. The principal river is the\r\nNelson, which, with its great tributary, the Saskatchewan, is 1450 m.\r\nlong; other tributaries are the Berens, English, Winnipeg, Red and\r\nAssiniboine. The Hayes, Severn and Winisk also flow from the south-west\r\ninto Hudson Bay, and the Ekwan, Attawapiskat and Albany, 500 m. long,\r\ninto James Bay. The Churchill, 925 m., Thlewliaza, Maguse, and Ferguson\r\nrivers discharge into Hudson Bay on the west side; the Kazan, 500 m.,\r\nand Dubawnt, 660 m., into Chesterfield Inlet; and Back's river, rising\r\nnear Aylmer Lake, flows north-eastwards 560 m. to the Arctic Ocean. The\r\nprincipal lakes are St Joseph and Seul on the southern boundary;\r\nnorthern part of Lake Winnipeg, 710 ft. above the sea; Island; South\r\nIndian; Etawney; Nueltin; Yathkyed, at an altitude of 300 ft.; Maguse;\r\nKaminuriak; Baker, 30 ft.; Aberdeen, 130 ft.; and Garry. The principal\r\nislands are Southampton, area 17,800 sq. m.; Marble Island, the usual\r\nwintering place for whaling vessels; and Bell and Coats Islands, in\r\nHudson Bay; and Akimiski, in James Bay.\r\n\r\nA few small communities at the posts of the Hudson Bay Company\r\nconstitute practically the whole of the white population. In 1897 there\r\nwere 852 Indians in the Churchill and Nelson rivers district, but no\r\nfigures are available for the district as a whole. The principal posts\r\nin Keewatin are Norway House, near the outlet of Lake Winnipeg; Oxford\r\nHouse, on the lake of the same name; York Factory, at the mouth of Hayes\r\nriver; and Forts Severn and Churchill, at the mouths of the Severn and\r\nChurchill rivers respectively. In 1905 the district of Keewatin was\r\nincluded in the North-West Territories and the whole placed under an\r\nadministrator or acting governor. The derivation of the name is from the\r\nCree--the \"north wind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEF, more correctly El-Kef (the Rock), a town of Tunisia, 125 m. by rail\r\nS.S.W. of the capital, and 75 m. S.E. of Bona in Algeria. It occupies\r\nthe site of the Roman colony of Sicca Veneria, and is built on the steep\r\nslope of a rock in a mountainous region through which flows the\r\nMellegue, an affluent of the Mejerda. Situated at the intersection of\r\nmain routes from the west and south, Kef occupies a position of\r\nstrategic importance. Though distant some 22 m. from the Algerian\r\nfrontier it was practically a border post, and its walls and citadel\r\nwere kept in a state of defence by the Tunisians. The town with its\r\nhalf-dozen mosques and tortuous, dirty streets, is still partly walled.\r\nThe southern part of the wall has however been destroyed by the French,\r\nand the remainder is being left to decay. Beyond the part of the wall\r\ndestroyed is the French quarter. The _kasbah_, or citadel, occupies a\r\nrocky eminence on the west side of the town. It was built, or rebuilt,\r\nby the Turks, the material being Roman. It has been restored by the\r\nFrench, who maintain a garrison here.\r\n\r\nThe Roman remains include fragments of a large temple dedicated to\r\nHercules, and of the baths. The ancient cisterns remain, but are empty,\r\nbeing used as part of the barracks. The town is however supplied by\r\nwater from the same spring which filled the cisterns. The Christian\r\ncemetery is on the site of a basilica. There are ruins of another\r\nChristian basilica, excavated by the French, the apse being intact and\r\nthe narthex serving as a church. Many stones with Roman inscriptions are\r\nbuilt into the walls of Arab houses. The modern town is much smaller\r\nthan the Roman colony. Pop. about 6000, including about 100 Europeans\r\n(chiefly Maltese).\r\n\r\n  The Roman colony of Sicca Veneria appears from the character of its\r\n  worship of Venus (Val. Max. ii. 6, S 15) to have been a Phoenician\r\n  settlement. It was afterwards a Numidian stronghold, and under the\r\n  Caesars became a fashionable residential city and one of the chief\r\n  centres of Christianity in North Africa. The Christian apologist\r\n  Arnobius the Elder lived here.\r\n\r\n  See H. Barth, _Die Kustenlander des Mittelmeeres_ (1849); _Corpus\r\n  Inscript. Lat._, vol. viii.; Sombrun in _Bull. de la soc. de geog. de\r\n  Bordeaux_ (1878). Also Cardinal Newman's Callista: _a Sketch of the\r\n  Third Century_ (1856), for a \"reconstruction\" of the manner of life of\r\n  the early Christians and their oppressors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEHL, a town in the grand-duchy of Baden, on the right bank of the\r\nRhine, opposite Strassburg, with which it is connected by a railway\r\nbridge and a bridge of boats. Pop. 4000. It has a considerable river\r\ntrade in timber, tobacco and coal, which has been developed by the\r\nformation of a harbour with two basins. The chief importance of Kehl is\r\nits connexion with the military defence of Strassburg, to the strategic\r\narea of which it belongs. It is encircled by the strong forts Bose,\r\nBlumenthal and Kirchbach of that system. In 1678 Kehl was taken from the\r\nimperialists by the French, and in 1683 a new fortress, built by Vauban,\r\nwas begun. In 1697 it was restored to the Empire and was given to Baden,\r\nbut in 1703 and again in 1733 it was taken by the French, who did not\r\nhowever retain it for very long. In 1793 the French again took the town,\r\nwhich was retaken by the Austrians and was restored to Baden in 1803. In\r\n1808 the French, again in possession, restored the fortifications, but\r\nthese were dismantled in 1815, when Kehl was again restored to Baden. In\r\nAugust 1870, during the Franco-German War, the French shelled the\r\ndefenceless town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEIGHLEY (locally KEITHLEY), a municipal borough in the Keighley\r\nparliamentary division of the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, 17 m.\r\nW.N.W. of Leeds, on branches of the Great Northern and Midland railways.\r\nPop. (1901), 41,564. It is beautifully situated in a deep valley near\r\nthe junction of the Worth with the Aire. A canal between Liverpool and\r\nHull affords it water communication with both west and east coasts. The\r\nprincipal buildings are the parish church of St Andrew (dating from the\r\ntime of Henry I., modernized in 1710, rebuilt with the exception of the\r\ntower in 1805, and again rebuilt in 1878), and the handsome Gothic\r\nmechanics' institute and technical school (1870). A grammar school was\r\nfounded in 1713, the operations of which have been extended so as to\r\nembrace a trade school (1871) for boys, and a grammar school for girls.\r\nThe principal industries are manufactures of woollen goods, spinning,\r\nsewing and washing machines, and tools. The town was incorporated in\r\n1882, and the corporation consists of a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18\r\ncouncillors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEI ISLANDS [_Ke_, _Key_, _Kii_, &c.; native, _Ewab_], a group in the\r\nDutch East Indies, in the residency of Amboyna, between 5 deg. and 6\r\ndeg. 5' S. and 131 deg. 50' and 133 deg. 15' E., and consisting of four\r\nparts: Nuhu-Iut or Great Kei, Roa or Little Kei, the Tayanda, and the\r\nKur group. Great Kei differs physically in every respect from the other\r\ngroups. It is of Tertiary formation (Miocene), and has a chain of\r\nvolcanic elevations along the axis, reaching a height of 2600 ft. Its\r\narea is 290 sq. m., the total land area of the group being 572 sq. m.\r\nAll the other islands are of post-Tertiary formation and of level\r\nsurface. The group has submarine connexion, under relatively shallow\r\nsea, with the Timorlaut group to the south-west and the chain of islands\r\nextending north-west towards Ceram; deep water separates it on the east\r\nfrom the Aru Islands and on the west from the inner islands of the Banda\r\nSea. Among the products are coco-nuts, sago, fish, trepang, timber,\r\ncopra, maize, yams and tobacco. The population is about 23,000, of whom\r\n14,900 are pagans, and 8300 Mahommedans.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are of three types. There is the true Kei Islander, a\r\nPolynesian by his height and black or brown wavy hair, with a complexion\r\nbetween the Papuan black and the Malay yellow. There is the pure Papuan,\r\nwho has been largely merged in the Kei type. Thirdly, there are the\r\nimmigrant Malays. These (distinguished by the use of a special language\r\nand by the profession of Mohammedanism) are descendants of natives of\r\nthe Banda islands who fled eastward before the encroachments of the\r\nDutch. The pagans have rude statues of deities and places of sacrifice\r\nindicated by flat-topped cairns. The Kei Islanders are skilful in\r\ncarving and celebrated boat-builders.\r\n\r\n  See C. M.

His father, Johann Christian\r\nKeim, was headmaster of a gymnasium. Here Karl Theodor received his\r\nearly education, and then proceeded to the Stuttgart Obergymnasium. In\r\n1843 he went to the university of Tubingen, where he studied philosophy\r\nunder J. F. Reiff, a follower of Hegel, and Oriental languages under\r\nHeinrich Ewald and Heinrich Meier. F. C. Baur, the leader of the new\r\nTubingen school, was lecturing on the New Testament and on the history\r\nof the church and of dogma, and by him in particular Keim was greatly\r\nimpressed. The special bent of Keim's mind is seen in his prize essay,\r\n_Verhaltniss der Christen in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten bis\r\nKonstantin zum romischen Reiche_ (1847). His first published work was\r\n_Die Reformation der Reichstadt Ulm_ (1851). In 1850 he visited the\r\nuniversity of Bonn, where he attended some of the lectures of Friedrich\r\nBleek, Richard Rothe, C. M. Arndt and Isaak Dorner. He taught at\r\nTubingen from June 1851 until 1856, when, having become a pastor, he was\r\nmade deacon at Esslingen, Wurttemberg. In 1859 he was appointed\r\narchdeacon; but a few months later he was called to the university of\r\nZurich as professor of theology (1859-1873), where he produced his\r\nimportant works. Before this he had written on church history (e.g.\r\n_Schwabische Reformationsgeschichte bis zum Augsburger Reichstag_,\r\n1855). His inaugural address at Zurich on the human development of\r\nJesus, _Die menschliche Entwicklung Jesu Christi_ (1861), and his _Die\r\ngeschichtliche Wurde Jesu_ (1864) were preparatory to his chief work,\r\n_Die Geschichte Jesu von Nazara in ihrer Verkettung mit dem Gesamtleben\r\nseines Volkes_ (3 vols., 1867-1872; Eng. trans., _Jesus of Nazareth, and\r\nthe National Life of Israel_, 6 vols.), 1873-1882. In 1873 Keim was\r\nappointed professor of theology at Giessen. This post he resigned,\r\nthrough ill-health, shortly before his death on the 17th of November\r\n1878. He belonged to the \"mediation\" school of theology.\r\n\r\n  Chief works, besides the above: _Reformationsblatter der Reichsstadt\r\n  Esslingen_ (1860); _Ambrosius Blarer, der Schwabische Reformator_\r\n  (1860); _Der Ubertritt Konstantins d. Gr. zum Christenthum_ (1862);\r\n  his sermons, _Freundesworte zur Gemeinde_ (2 vols., 1861-1862); and\r\n  _Celsus' wahres Wort_ (1873). In 1881 H. Ziegler published one of\r\n  Keim's earliest works, _Rom und das Christenthum_, with a biographical\r\n  sketch. See also Ziegler's article in Herzog-Hauck,\r\n  _Realencyklopadie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEITH, the name of an old Scottish family which derived its name from\r\nthe barony of Keith in East Lothian, said to have been granted by\r\nMalcolm II., king of Scotland, to a member of the house for services\r\nagainst the Danes. The office of great marishal of Scotland, afterwards\r\nhereditary in the Keith family, may have been conferred at the same\r\ntime; for it was confirmed, together with possession of the lands of\r\nKeith, to Sir Robert Keith by a charter of King Robert Bruce, and\r\nappears to have been held as annexed to the land by the tenure of grand\r\nserjeanty. Sir Robert Keith commanded the Scottish horse at Bannockburn,\r\nand was killed at the battle of Neville's Cross in 1346. At the close\r\nof the 14th century Sir William Keith, by exchange of lands with Lord\r\nLindsay, obtained the crag of Dunnottar in Kincardineshire, where he\r\nbuilt the castle of Dunnottar, which became the stronghold of his\r\ndescendants. He died about 1407. In 1430 a later Sir William Keith was\r\ncreated Lord Keith, and a few years afterwards earl marishal, and these\r\ntitles remained in the family till 1716. William, fourth earl marishal\r\n(d. 1581), was one of the guardians of Mary queen of Scots during her\r\nminority, and was a member of her privy council on her return to\r\nScotland. While refraining from extreme partisanship, he was an adherent\r\nof the Reformation; he retired into private life at Dunnottar Castle\r\nabout 1567, thereby gaining the sobriquet \"William of the Tower.\" He was\r\nreputed to be the wealthiest man in Scotland. His eldest daughter Anne\r\nmarried the regent Murray. His grandson George, 5th earl marishal (c.\r\n1553-1623), was one of the most cultured men of his time. He was\r\neducated at King's College, Aberdeen, where he became a proficient\r\nclassical scholar, afterwards studying divinity under Theodore Beza at\r\nGeneva. He was a firm Protestant, and took an active part in the affairs\r\nof the kirk. His high character and abilities procured him the\r\nappointment of special ambassador to Denmark to arrange the marriage of\r\nJames VI. with the Princess Anne. He was subsequently employed on a\r\nnumber of important commissions; but he preferred literature to public\r\naffairs, and about 1620 he retired to Dunnottar, where he died in 1623.\r\nHe is chiefly remembered as the founder in 1593 of the Marischal College\r\nin the university of Aberdeen, which he richly endowed. From an uncle he\r\ninherited the title of Lord Altrie about 1590. William, 7th earl\r\nmarishal (c. 1617-1661), took a prominent part in the Civil War, being\r\nat first a leader of the covenanting party in north-east Scotland, and\r\nthe most powerful opponent of the marquess of Huntly. He co-operated\r\nwith Montrose in Aberdeenshire and neighbouring counties against the\r\nGordons. With Montrose he signed the Bond of Cumbernauld in August 1640,\r\nbut took no active steps against the popular party till 1648, when he\r\njoined the duke of Hamilton in his invasion of England, escaping from\r\nthe rout at Preston. In 1650 Charles II. was entertained by the marishal\r\nat Dunnottar; and in 1651 the Scottish regalia were left for safe\r\nkeeping in his castle. Taken prisoner in the same year, he was committed\r\nto the Tower and was excluded from Cromwell's Act of Grace. He was made\r\na privy councillor at the Restoration and died in 1661. Sir John Keith\r\n(d. 1714), brother of the 7th earl marishal, was, at the Restoration,\r\ngiven the hereditary office of knight marishal of Scotland, and in 1677\r\nwas created earl of Kintore, and Lord Keith of Inverurie and Keith-Hall,\r\na reward for his share in preserving the regalia of Scotland, which were\r\nsecretly conveyed from Dunnottar to another hiding-place, when the\r\ncastle was besieged by Cromwell's troops, and which Sir John, perilously\r\nto himself, swore he had carried abroad and delivered to Charles II.,\r\nthus preventing further search. From him are descended the earls of\r\nKintore.\r\n\r\nGEORGE, 10th earl marishal (c. 1693-1778), served under Marlborough, and\r\nlike his brother Francis, Marshal Keith (q.v.), was a zealous Jacobite,\r\ntaking part in the rising of 1715, after which he escaped to the\r\ncontinent. In the following year he was attainted, his estates and\r\ntitles being forfeited to the Crown. He lived for many years in Spain,\r\nwhere he concerned himself with Jacobite intrigues, but he took no part\r\nin the rebellion of 1745, proceeding about that year to Prussia, where\r\nhe became, like his brother, intimate with Frederick the Great.\r\nFrederick employed him in several diplomatic posts, and he is said to\r\nhave conveyed valuable information to the earl of Chatham, as a reward\r\nfor which he received a pardon from George II., and returned to Scotland\r\nin 1759. His heir male, on whom, but for the attainder of 1716, his\r\ntitles would have devolved, was apparently his cousin Alexander Keith of\r\nRavelston, to whom the attainted earl had sold the castle and lands of\r\nDunnottar in 1766. From Alexander Keith was descended, through the\r\nfemale line, Sir Patrick Keith Murray of Ochtertyre, who sold the\r\nestates of Dunnottar and Ravelston. After the attainder of 1716 the\r\nright of the Keiths of Ravelston to be recognized as the representatives\r\nof the earls marishal was disputed by Robert Keith (1681-1757), bishop\r\nof Fife, a member of another collateral branch of the family. The bishop\r\nwas a writer of some repute, his chief work, _The History of the Affairs\r\nof the Church and State of Scotland_ (Edinburgh, 1734), being of\r\nconsiderable value for the reigns of James V., James VI., and Mary Queen\r\nof Scots. He also published a _Catalogue of the Bishops of Scotland_\r\n(Edinburgh, 1755), and other less important historical and theological\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nROBERT KEITH (d. 1774), descended from a younger son of the 2nd earl\r\nmarishal, was British minister in Vienna in 1748, and subsequently held\r\nother important diplomatic appointments, being known to his numerous\r\nfriends, among whom were the leading men of letters of his time, as\r\n\"Ambassador Keith.\" His son, Sir Robert Murray Keith (1730-1795), was on\r\nLord George Sackville's staff at the battle of Minden. He became colonel\r\nof a regiment (the 87th foot) known as Keith's Highlanders, who won\r\ndistinction in the continental wars, but were disbanded in 1763; he was\r\nthen employed in the diplomatic service, in which he achieved\r\nconsiderable success by his honesty, courage, and knowledge of\r\nlanguages. In 1781 he became lieutenant-general; in 1789 he was made a\r\nprivy councillor.\r\n\r\nFrom the Keith family through the female line was descended George Keith\r\nElphinstone, Baron Keith of Stonehaven, Marishal and afterwards Viscount\r\nKeith (q.v.), whose titles became extinct at the death of his daughter\r\nMargaret, Baroness Keith, in 1867.\r\n\r\n  See _Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland_, edited by J.

M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEITH, FRANCIS EDWARD JAMES (1696-1758), Scottish soldier and Prussian\r\nfield marshal, was the second son of William, 9th earl marishal of\r\nScotland, and was born on the 11th of June 1696 at the castle of\r\nInverugie near Peterhead. Through his careful education under Robert\r\nKeith, bishop of Fife, and subsequently at Edinburgh University in\r\npreparation for the legal profession, he acquired that taste for\r\nliterature which afterwards secured him the esteem of the most\r\ndistinguished savants of Europe; but at an early period his preference\r\nfor a soldier's career was decided. The rebellion of 1715, in which he\r\ndisplayed qualities that gave some augury of his future eminence,\r\ncompelled him to seek safety on the Continent. After spending two years\r\nin Paris, chiefly at the university, he in 1719 took part in the\r\nill-starred expedition of the Pretender to the Highlands of Scotland. He\r\nthen passed some time at Paris and Madrid in obscurity and poverty, but\r\neventually obtained a colonelcy in the Spanish army, and, it is said,\r\ntook part in the siege of Gibraltar (1726-27). Finding his Protestantism\r\na barrier to promotion, he obtained from the king of Spain a\r\nrecommendation to Peter II. of Russia, from whom he received (1728) the\r\ncommand of a regiment of the guards. He displayed in numerous campaigns\r\nthe calm, intelligent and watchful valour which was his chief\r\ncharacteristic, obtaining the rank of general of infantry and the\r\nreputation of being one of the ablest officers in the Russian service as\r\nwell as a capable and liberal civil administrator. Judging, however,\r\nthat his rewards were not commensurate with his merits, he in 1747\r\noffered his services to Frederick II. of Prussia, who at once gave him\r\nthe rank of field marshal, in 1749 made him governor of Berlin, and soon\r\ncame to cherish towards him, as towards his brother, the 10th earl\r\nmarishal, a strong personal regard. In 1756 the Seven Years' War broke\r\nout. Keith was employed in high command from the first, and added to his\r\nRussian reputation on every occasion by resolution and promptitude of\r\naction, not less than by care and skill. In 1756 he commanded the troops\r\ncovering the investment of Pirna, and distinguished himself at Lobositz.\r\nIn 1757 he commanded at the siege of Prague; later in this same\r\ncampaign he defended Leipzig against a greatly superior force, was\r\npresent at Rossbach, and, while the king was fighting the campaign of\r\nLeuthen, conducted a foray into Bohemia. In 1758 he took a prominent\r\npart in the unsuccessful Moravian campaign, after which he withdrew from\r\nthe army to recruit his broken health. He returned in time for the\r\nautumn campaign in the Lausitz, and was killed on the 14th of October\r\n1758 at the battle of Hochkirch. His body was honourably buried on the\r\nfield by Marshal Daun and General Lacy, the son of his old commander in\r\nRussia, and was shortly afterwards transferred by Frederick to the\r\ngarrison church of Berlin. Many memorials were erected to him by the\r\nking, Prince Henry, and others. Keith died unmarried, but had several\r\nchildren by his mistress, Eva Mertens, a Swedish prisoner captured by\r\nhim in the war of 1741-43. In 1889 the 1st Silesian infantry regiment\r\nNo. 22 of the German army received his name.\r\n\r\n  See K. A.

In 1662 he became a Quaker and worked with Robert\r\nBarclay (q.v.). After being imprisoned for preaching in 1676 he went to\r\nHolland and Germany on an evangelistic tour with George Fox and William\r\nPenn. Two further terms of imprisonment in England induced him (1684) to\r\nemigrate to America, where he was surveyor-general in East New Jersey\r\nand then a schoolmaster at Philadelphia. He travelled in New England\r\ndefending Quakerism against the attacks of Increase and Cotton Mather,\r\nbut after a time fell out with his own folk on the subject of the\r\natonement, accused them of deistic views, and started a community of his\r\nown called \"Christian Quakers\" or \"Keithians.\" He endeavoured to advance\r\nhis views in London, but the Yearly Meeting of 1694 disowned him, and he\r\nestablished a society at Turner's Hall in Philpot Lane, where he so far\r\ndeparted from Quaker usage as to administer the two sacraments. In 1700\r\nhe conformed to the Anglican Church, and from 1702 to 1704 was an agent\r\nof the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in America. He died on\r\nthe 27th of March 1716 at Edburton in Sussex, of which parish he was\r\nrector. Among his writings were _The Deism of William Penn and his\r\nBrethren_ (1699); _The Standard of the Quakers examined; or, an Answer\r\nto the Apology of Robert Barclay_ (1702); _A Journal of Travels_ (1706).\r\nGilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, a fellow-Aberdonian, speaks of him\r\nas \"the most learned man that ever was in that sect, and well versed in\r\nthe Oriental tongues, philosophy and mathematics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEITH, GEORGE KEITH ELPHINSTONE, VISCOUNT (1746-1823), British admiral,\r\nfifth son of the 10th Lord Elphinstone, was born in Elphinstone Tower,\r\nnear Stirling, on the 7th of January 1746. Two of his brothers went to\r\nsea, and he followed their example by entering the navy in 1761, in the\r\n\"Gosport,\" then commanded by Captain Jervis, afterwards Earl St Vincent.\r\nIn 1767 he made a voyage to the East Indies in the Company's service,\r\nand put L2000 lent him by an uncle to such good purpose in a private\r\ntrading venture that he laid the foundation of a handsome fortune. He\r\nbecame lieutenant in 1770, commander in 1772, and post captain in 1775.\r\nDuring the war in America he was employed against the privateers, and\r\nwith a naval brigade at the occupation of Charleston, S.C. In January\r\n1781, when in command of the \"Warwick\" (50), he captured a Dutch 50-gun\r\nship which had beaten off an English vessel of equal strength a few days\r\nbefore. After peace was signed he remained on shore for ten years,\r\nserving in Parliament as member first for Dumbartonshire, and then for\r\nStirlingshire. When war broke out again in 1793 he was appointed to the\r\n\"Robust\" (74), in which he took part in the occupation of Toulon by lord\r\nHood. He particularly distinguished himself by beating a body of the\r\nFrench ashore at the head of a naval brigade of English and Spaniards.\r\nHe was entrusted with the duty of embarking the fugitives when the town\r\nwas evacuated. In 1794 he was promoted rear-admiral, and in 1795 he was\r\nsent to occupy the Dutch colonies at the Cape of Good Hope and in India.\r\nHe had a large share in the capture of the Cape in 1795, and in August\r\n1796 captured a whole Dutch squadron in Saldanha Bay. In the interval he\r\nhad gone on to India, where his health suffered, and the capture at\r\nSaldanha was effected on his way home. When the Mutiny at the Nore broke\r\nout in 1797 he was appointed to the command, and was soon able to\r\nrestore order. He was equally successful at Plymouth, where the squadron\r\nwas also in a state of effervescence. At the close of 1798 he was sent\r\nas second in command to St Vincent. It was for a long time a thankless\r\npost, for St Vincent was at once half incapacitated by ill-health and\r\nvery arbitrary, while Nelson, who considered that Keith's appointment\r\nwas a personal slight to himself, was peevish and insubordinate. The\r\nescape of a French squadron which entered the Mediterranean from Brest\r\nin May 1799 was mainly due to jarrings among the British naval\r\ncommanders. Keith followed the enemy to Brest on their retreat, but was\r\nunable to bring them to action. He returned to the Mediterranean in\r\nNovember as commander-in-chief. He co-operated with the Austrians in the\r\nsiege of Genoa, which surrendered on the 4th of June 1800. It was\r\nhowever immediately afterwards lost in consequence of the battle of\r\nMarengo, and the French made their re-entry so rapidly that the admiral\r\nhad considerable difficulty in getting his ships out of the harbour. The\r\nclose of 1801 and the beginning of the following year were spent in\r\ntransporting the army sent to recover Egypt from the French. As the\r\nnaval force of the enemy was completely driven into port, the British\r\nadmiral had no opportunity of an action at sea, but his management of\r\nthe convoy carrying the troops, and of the landing at Aboukir, was\r\ngreatly admired. He was made a baron of the United Kingdom--an Irish\r\nbarony having been conferred on him in 1797. On the renewal of the war\r\nin 1803 he was appointed commander-in-chief in the North Sea, which post\r\nhe held till 1807. In February 1812 he was appointed commander-in-chief\r\nin the Channel, and in 1814 he was raised to a viscounty. During his\r\nlast two commands he was engaged first in overlooking the measures taken\r\nto meet a threatened invasion, and then in directing the movements of\r\nthe numerous small squadrons and private ships employed on the coasts of\r\nSpain and Portugal, and in protecting trade. He was at Plymouth when\r\nNapoleon surrendered and was brought to England in the \"Bellerophon\" by\r\nCaptain Maitland (1777-1839). The decisions of the British government\r\nwere expressed through him to the fallen Emperor. Lord Keith refused to\r\nbe led into disputes, and confined himself to declaring steadily that he\r\nhad his orders to obey. He was not much impressed by the appearance of\r\nhis illustrious charge, and thought that the airs of Napoleon and his\r\nsuite were ridiculous. Lord Keith died on the 10th of March 1823 at\r\nTullyallan, his property in Scotland, and was buried in the parish\r\nchurch. A portrait of him by Owen is in the Painted Hall in Greenwich.\r\nHe was twice married: in 1787 to Jane Mercer, daughter of Colonel\r\nWilliam Mercer of Aldie; and in 1808 to Hester Maria Thrale, who is\r\nspoken of as \"Queenie\" in Boswell's _Life of Johnson_ and Mme.\r\nD'Arblay's _Diary_. He had a daughter by each marriage, but no son. Thus\r\nthe viscounty became extinct on his death, but the English and Irish\r\nbaronies descended to his elder daughter Margaret (1788-1867), who\r\nmarried the Comte de Flahault de la Billarderie, only to become extinct\r\non her death.\r\n\r\n  There is a panegyrical _Life of Lord Keith_ by Alex. Allardyce\r\n  (Edinburgh, 1882); and biographical notices will be found in John\r\n  Marshall's _Royal Naval Biography_, i. 43 (1823-1835), and the _Naval\r\n  Chronicle_, X. 1.     (D. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEITH, a police burgh of Banffshire, Scotland, on the Isla, 53(1/4) m.\r\nN.W. of Aberdeen by the Great North of Scotland railway. Pop. (1901),\r\n4753. A branch of the Highland railway also gives access to Elgin, and\r\nthere is a line to Buckie and Portessie on the Moray Firth. The burgh\r\nincludes Old Keith and New Keith on the east bank of the Isla, and\r\nFife-Keith on the west bank. Though Old Keith has a charter dating from\r\nWilliam the Lion it fell into gradual decay; New Keith, founded in the\r\n18th century by the second earl of Seafield, being better situated for\r\nthe growth of a town. Fife-Keith has sprung up since 1816. The principal\r\npublic buildings include the Turner memorial hospital, the Longmore\r\nhall, and the Institute. In the Roman Catholic church there is a\r\npainting of the \"Incredulity of St Thomas,\" presented by Charles X. of\r\nFrance. The industries include manufactures of tweeds, blankets,\r\nagricultural implements, and boots and shoes; there are also\r\ndistilleries, breweries, flour mills, and lime and manure works. But the\r\nmain importance of Keith lies in the fact that it is the centre of the\r\nagricultural trade of the shire. The \"Summer Eve Fair\" held in September\r\nis the largest cattle and horse fair in the north of Scotland; the town\r\nis also the headquarters of the dressed-meat trade in the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEJ, or KECH, the chief place in a district of the province of Makran in\r\nBaluchistan, which has given its name to Kej-Makran, as distinguished\r\nfrom Persian Makran. There is no town, but a number of small villages\r\ndominated by a fort built upon a rock, on the eastern bank of the Kej\r\nRiver. This fort, like many others similarly placed throughout the\r\ncountry, is supposed to be impregnable, but is of no strength except\r\nagainst the matchlocks of the surrounding tribes. Kej (or Kiz) was an\r\nimportant trade centre in the days of Arab supremacy in Sind, and the\r\nrulers of Kalat at various times marched armies into the province with a\r\nview to maintaining their authority. At the beginning of the 19th\r\ncentury it had the reputation of a commercial centre, trading through\r\nPanjgur with Kandahar, with Karachi via Bela, and with Muscat and the\r\nPersian Gulf by the seaport of Gwadar, distant about 80 m. The present\r\nKhan of Kalat exercises but a feeble sway over this portion of his\r\ndominion, although he appoints a governor to the province. The principal\r\ntribe residing around Kej is that of the Gichki, who claim to be of\r\nRajput origin, and to have settled in Makran during the 17th century,\r\nhaving been driven out of Rajputana. The climate during summer is too\r\nhot for Europeans. During winter, however, it is temperate. The\r\nprincipal exports consist of dates, which are considered of the finest\r\nquality. A local revolt against Kalat rendered an expedition against Kej\r\nnecessary in 1898. Colonel Mayne reduced the fortress and restored order\r\nin the surrounding districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEKULE, FRIEDRICH AUGUST (1829-1896), German chemist, was born at\r\nDarmstadt on the 7th of September 1829. While studying architecture at\r\nGiessen he came under the influence of Liebig and was induced to take up\r\nchemistry. From Giessen he went to Paris, and then, after a short\r\nsojourn in Switzerland, he visited England. Both in Paris and in England\r\nhe enjoyed personal intercourse with the leading chemists of the period.\r\nOn his return to Germany he started a small chemical laboratory at\r\nHeidelberg, where, with a very slender equipment, he carried out several\r\nimportant researches. In 1858 he was appointed professor of chemistry at\r\nGhent, and in 1865 was called to Bonn to fill a similar position, which\r\nhe held till his death in that town on the 13th of June 1896. Kekule's\r\nmain importance lies in the far-reaching contributions which he made to\r\nchemical theory, especially in regard to the constitution of the carbon\r\ncompounds. The doctrine of atomicity had already been enunciated by E.\r\nFrankland, when in 1858 Kekule published a paper in which, after giving\r\nreasons for regarding carbon as a tetravalent element, he set forth the\r\nessential features of his famous doctrine of the linking of atoms. He\r\nexplained that in substances containing several carbon atoms it must be\r\nassumed that some of the affinities of each carbon atom are bound by the\r\naffinities of the atoms of other elements contained in the substance,\r\nand some by an equal number of the affinities of the other carbon atoms.\r\nThe simplest case is when two carbon atoms are combined so that one\r\naffinity of the one is tied to one affinity of the other; two,\r\ntherefore, of the affinities of the two atoms are occupied in keeping\r\nthe two atoms together, and only the remaining six are available for\r\natoms of other elements. The next simplest case consists in the mutual\r\ninterchange of two affinity units, and so on. This conception led Kekule\r\nto his \"closed-chain\" or \"ring\" theory of the constitution of benzene\r\nwhich has been called the \"most brilliant piece of prediction to be\r\nfound in the whole range of organic chemistry,\" and this in turn led in\r\nparticular to the elucidation of the constitution of the \"aromatic\r\ncompounds,\" and in general to new methods of chemical synthesis and\r\ndecomposition, and to a deeper insight into the composition of\r\nnumberless organic bodies and their mutual relations. Professor F. R.\r\nJapp, in the Kekule memorial lecture he delivered before the London\r\nChemical Society on the 15th of December 1897, declared that\r\nthree-fourths of modern organic chemistry is directly or indirectly the\r\nproduct of Kekule's benzene theory, and that without its guidance and\r\ninspiration the industries of the coal-tar colours and artificial\r\ntherapeutic agents in their present form and extension would have been\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\n  Many of Kekule's papers appeared in the _Annalen der Chemie_, of which\r\n  he was editor, and he also published an important work, _Lehrbuch der\r\n  organischen Chemie_, of which the first three volumes are dated 1861,\r\n  1866 and 1882, while of the fourth only one small section was issued\r\n  in 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKELLER, ALBERT (1845-   ), German painter, was born at Gais, in\r\nSwitzerland; he studied at the Munich Academy under Lenbach and Ramberg,\r\nand must be counted among the leading colourists of the modern German\r\nschool. Travels in Italy, France, England and Holland, and a prolonged\r\nsojourn in Paris, helped to develop his style, which is marked by a\r\nsense of elegance and refinement all too rare in German art. His scenes\r\nof society life, such as the famous \"Dinner\" (1890), are painted with\r\nthoroughly Parisian _esprit_, and his portraits are marked by the same\r\nelegant distinction. He is particularly successful in the rendering of\r\nrustling silk and satin dresses and draperies. His historical and\r\nimaginative works are as modern in spirit and as unacademical as his\r\nportraits. At the Munich Pinakothek is his painting \"Jairi Tochterlein\"\r\n(1886), whilst the Konigsberg Museum contains his \"Roman Bath,\" and the\r\nLiebieg collection in Reichenberg the \"Audience with Louis XV.,\" the\r\nfirst picture that drew attention to his talent. Among other important\r\nworks he painted \"Faustina in the Temple of Juno at Praeneste,\" \"The\r\nWitches' Sleep\" (1888), \"The Judgment of Paris,\" \"The Happy Sister,\"\r\n\"Temptation\" (1892), \"Autumn\" (1893), \"An Adventure\" (1896), and \"The\r\nCrucifixion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKELLER, GOTTFRIED (1819-1890), German poet and novelist, was born at\r\nZurich on the 19th of July 1819. His father, a master joiner, dying\r\nwhile Gottfried was young, his early education was neglected; he,\r\nhowever, was in 1835 apprenticed to a landscape painter, and\r\nsubsequently spent two years (1840-1842) in Munich learning to paint.\r\nInterest in politics drew him into literature, and his talents were\r\nfirst disclosed in a volume of short poems, _Gedichte_ (1846). This\r\nobtained him recognition from the government of his native canton, and\r\nhe was in 1848 enabled to take a short course of philosophical study at\r\nthe university of Heidelberg. From 1850 to 1855 he lived in Berlin,\r\nwhere he wrote his most important novel, _Der grune Heinrich_\r\n(1851-1853; revised edition 1879-1880), remarkable for its delicate\r\nautographic portraiture and the beautiful episodes interwoven with the\r\naction. This was followed by _Die Leute von Seldwyla_ (1856), studies of\r\nSwiss provincial life, including in _Romeo und Julia auf dem Dorfe_ one\r\nof the most powerful short stories in the German language, and in _Die\r\ndrei gerechten Kammmacher_, almost as great a masterpiece of humorous\r\nwriting. Returning to his native city with a considerable reputation, he\r\nreceived in 1861 the appointment of secretary to the canton. For a time\r\nhis creative faculty seemed paralysed by his public duties, but in 1872\r\nappeared _Sieben Legenden_, and in 1874 a second series of _Die Leute\r\nvon Seldwyla_, in both of which books he displayed no abatement of power\r\nand originality. He retired from the public service in 1876 and employed\r\nhis leisure in the production of _Zuricher Novellen_ (1878), _Das\r\nSinngedicht_, a collection of short stories (1881), and a novel, _Martin\r\nSalander_ (Berlin, 1886). He died on the 15th of July 1890 at Hottingen.\r\nKeller's place among German novelists is very high. Few have united such\r\nfancy and imagination to such uncompromising realism, or such tragic\r\nearnestness to such abounding humour. As a lyric poet, his genius is no\r\nless original; he takes rank with the best German poets of this class\r\nin the second half of the 19th century.\r\n\r\n  Keller's _Gesammelte Werke_ were published in 10 vols. (1889-1890), to\r\n  which was added another volume, _Nachgelassene Schriften und\r\n  Dichtungen_, containing the fragment of a tragedy (1893). In English\r\n  appeared, _G. Keller: A Selection of his Tales translated with a\r\n  Memoir by Kate Freiligrath-Kroeker_ (1891). For a further estimate of\r\n  Keller's life and works cf. O. Brahm (1883); E. Brenning, _G. Keller\r\n  nach seinem Leben und Dichten_ (1892); F. Baldensperger, _G. Keller;\r\n  sa vie et ses oeuvres_ (1893); A. Frey, _Erinnerungen an Gottfried\r\n  Keller_ (1893); J. Baechtold, _Kellers Leben. Seine Briefe und\r\n  Tagebucher_ (Berlin, 1894-1897); A. Koster, _G. Keller_ (1900; 2nd\r\n  ed., 1907); and for his work as a painter, H. E. von Berlepsch,\r\n  _Gottfried Keller als Maler_ (1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKELLER, HELEN ADAMS (1880-   ), American blind deaf-mute, was born at\r\nTuscumbia, Alabama, in 1880. When barely two years old she was deprived\r\nof sight, smell and hearing, by an attack of scarlet fever. At the\r\nrequest of her parents, who were acquainted with the success attained in\r\nthe case of Laura Bridgman (q.v.), one of the graduates of the Perkins\r\nInstitution at Boston, Miss Anne M. Sullivan, who was familiar with the\r\nteachings of Dr S. G. Howe (q.v.), was sent to instruct her at home.\r\nUnfortunately an exact record of the steps in her education was not\r\nkept; but from 1888 onwards, at the Perkins Institution, Boston, and\r\nunder Miss Sarah Fuller at the Horace Mann school in New York, and at\r\nthe Wright Humason school, she not only learnt to read, write, and talk,\r\nbut became proficient, to an exceptional degree, in the ordinary\r\neducational curriculum. In 1900 she entered Radcliffe College, and\r\nsuccessfully passed the examinations in mathematics, &c. for her degree\r\nof A.B. in 1904. Miss Sullivan, whose ability as a teacher must be\r\nconsidered almost as marvellous as the talent of her pupil, was\r\nthroughout her devoted companion. The case of Helen Keller is the most\r\nextraordinary ever known in the education of blind deaf-mutes (see DEAF\r\nAND DUMB _ad fin._), her acquirements including several languages and\r\nher general culture being exceptionally wide. She wrote _The Story of My\r\nLife_ (1902), and volumes on _Optimism_ (1903), and _The World I Live\r\nin_ (1908), which both in literary style and in outlook on life are a\r\nstriking revelation of the results of modern methods of educating those\r\nwho have been so handicapped by natural disabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKELLERMANN, FRANCOIS CHRISTOPHE DE (1735-1820), duke of Valmy and\r\nmarshal of France, came of a Saxon family, long settled in Strassburg\r\nand ennobled, and was born there on the 28th of May 1735. He entered the\r\nFrench army as a volunteer, and served in the Seven Years' War and in\r\nLouis XV.'s Polish expedition of 1771, on returning from which he was\r\nmade a lieutenant-colonel. He became brigadier in 1784, and in the\r\nfollowing year _marechal-de-camp_. In 1789 Kellermann enthusiastically\r\nembraced the cause of the Revolution, and in 1791 became general of the\r\narmy in Alsace. In April 1792 he was made a lieutenant-general, and in\r\nAugust of the same year there came to him the opportunity of his\r\nlifetime. He rose to the occasion, and his victory of Valmy (see FRENCH\r\nREVOLUTIONARY WARS) over the Prussians, in Goethe's words, \"opened a new\r\nera in the history of the world.\" Transferred to the army on the\r\nMoselle, Kellermann was accused by General Custine of neglecting to\r\nsupport his operations on the Rhine; but he was acquitted at the bar of\r\nthe Convention in Paris, and placed at the head of the army of the Alps\r\nand of Italy, in which position he showed himself a careful commander\r\nand excellent administrator. Shortly afterwards he received instructions\r\nto reduce Lyons, then in revolt against the Convention, but shortly\r\nafter the surrender he was imprisoned in Paris for thirteen months. Once\r\nmore honourably acquitted, he was reinstated in his command, and did\r\ngood service in maintaining the south-eastern border against the\r\nAustrians until his army was merged into that of General Bonaparte in\r\nItaly. He was then sixty-two years of age, still physically equal to his\r\nwork, but the young generals who had come to the front in these two\r\nyears represented the new spirit and the new art of war, and\r\nKellermann's active career came to an end. But the hero of Valmy was\r\nnever forgotten. When Napoleon came to power Kellermann was named\r\nsuccessively senator (1800), honorary marshal of France (1803), and\r\nduke of Valmy (1808). He was frequently employed in the administration\r\nof the army, the control of the line of communications, and the command\r\nof reserve troops, and his long and wide experience made him one of\r\nNapoleon's most valuable assistants. In 1814 he voted for the deposition\r\nof the emperor and became a peer under the royal government. After the\r\n\"Hundred Days\" he sat in the Chamber of Peers and voted with the\r\nLiberals. He died at Paris on the 23rd of September 1820.\r\n\r\n  See J. G. P. de Salve, _Fragments historiques sur M. le marechal de\r\n  Kellermann_ (Paris, 1807), and De Botidoux, _Esquisse de la carriere\r\n  militaire de F. C. Kellermann, duc de Valmy_ (Paris, 1817).\r\n\r\nHis son, FRANCOIS ETIENNE DE KELLERMANN, duke of Valmy (1770-1835),\r\nFrench cavalry general, was born at Metz and served for a short time in\r\nhis father's regiment of Hussars previous to entering the diplomatic\r\nservice in 1791. In 1793 he again joined the army, serving chiefly under\r\nhis father's command in the Alps, and rising in 1796 to the rank of\r\n_chef de brigade_. In the latter part of Bonaparte's celebrated Italian\r\ncampaign of 1796-97 the younger Kellermann attracted the future\r\nemperor's notice by his brilliant conduct at the forcing of the\r\nTagliamento. He was made general of brigade at once, and continued in\r\nItaly after the peace of Campo Formio, being employed successively in\r\nthe armies of Rome and Naples under Macdonald and Championnet. In the\r\ncampaign of 1800 he commanded a cavalry brigade under the First Consul,\r\nand at Marengo (q.v.) he initiated and carried out one of the most\r\nfamous cavalry charges of history, which, with Desaix's infantry attack,\r\nregained the lost battle and decided the issue of the war. He was\r\npromoted general of division at once, but as early as the evening of the\r\nbattle he resented what he thought to be an attempt to belittle his\r\nexploit. A heated controversy followed as to the influence of\r\nKellermann's charge on the course of the battle, and in this controversy\r\nhe displayed neither tact nor forbearance. However, his merits were too\r\ngreat for his career to be ruined either by his conduct in the dispute\r\nor by the frequent scandals, and even by the frauds, of his private\r\nlife. Unlike his father's, his title to fame did not rest on one\r\nfortunate opportunity. Though not the most famous, he was perhaps the\r\nablest of all Napoleon's cavalry leaders, and distinguished himself at\r\nAusterlitz (q.v.), in Portugal under Junot (on this occasion as a\r\nskilful diplomatist), at the brilliant cavalry combat of Tormes (Nov.\r\n28, 1809), and on many other occasions in the Peninsular War. His\r\nrapacity was more than ever notorious in Spain, yet Napoleon met his\r\nunconvincing excuses with the words, \"General, whenever your name is\r\nbrought before me, I think of nothing but Marengo.\" He was on sick leave\r\nduring the Russian expedition of 1812, but in 1813 and 1814 his skill\r\nand leading were as conspicuous as ever. He retained his rank under the\r\nfirst Restoration, but joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, and\r\ncommanded a cavalry corps in the Waterloo campaign. At Quatre Bras he\r\npersonally led his squadrons in the famous cavalry charge, and almost\r\nlost his life in the melee, and at Waterloo he was again wounded. He was\r\ndisgraced at the second Restoration, and, on succeeding to his father's\r\ntitle and seat in the Chamber of Peers in 1820, at once took up and\r\nmaintained till the fall of Charles X. in 1830 an attitude of determined\r\nopposition to the Bourbons. He died on the 2nd of June 1835.\r\n\r\nHis son FRANCOIS CHRISTOPHE EDMOND DE KELLERMANN, duke of Valmy\r\n(1802-1868), was a distinguished statesman, political historian, and\r\ndiplomatist under the July Monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKELLGREN, JOHAN HENRIK (1751-1795), Swedish poet and critic, was born at\r\nFloby in West Gothland, on the 1st of December 1751. He studied at the\r\nuniversity of Abo, and had already some reputation as a poet when in\r\n1774 he there became a \"docent\" in aesthetics. Three years later he\r\nremoved to Stockholm, where in conjunction with Assessor Carl Lenngren\r\nhe began in 1778 the publication of the journal _Stockholmsposten_, of\r\nwhich he was sole editor from 1788 onwards. Kellgren was librarian to\r\nGustavus III. from 1780, and from 1785 his private secretary. On the\r\ninstitution of the Swedish Academy in 1786 he was appointed one of its\r\nfirst members. He died at Stockholm on the 20th of April 1795. His\r\nstrong satiric tendency led him into numerous controversies, the chief\r\nthat with the critic Thomas Thorild, against whom he directed his satire\r\n_Nyt forsok till orimmad vers_, where he sneers at the \"raving of\r\nShakespeare\" and \"the convulsions of Goethe.\" His lack of humour\r\ndetracts from the interest of his polemical writings. His poetical works\r\nare partly lyrical, partly dramatic; of the plays the versification\r\nbelongs to him, the plots being due to Gustavus III. The songs\r\ninterspersed in the four operas which they produced in common, viz.,\r\n_Gustaf Vasa_, _Gustaf Adolf och Ebba Brahe_, _Aeneas i Kartago_, and\r\n_Drottning Kristina_, are wholly the work of Kellgren. From about the\r\nyear 1788 a higher and graver feeling pervades Kellgren's verses, partly\r\nowing to the influence of the works of Lessing and Goethe, but probably\r\nmore directly due to his controversy with Thorild. Of his minor poems\r\nwritten before that date the most important are the charming spring-song\r\n_Vinterns valde lyktar_, and the satirical _Mina lojen_ and _Man eger ej\r\nsnille for det man ar galen_. The best productions of what is called his\r\nlater period are the satire _Ljusets fiender_, the comic poem _Dumboms\r\nlefverne_, the warmly patriotic _Kantat d._ 1. _jan._ 1789, the ode\r\n_Till Kristina_, the fragment _Sigwart och Hilma_, and the beautiful\r\nsong _Nya skapelsen_, both in thought and form the finest of his works.\r\nAmong his lyrics are the choicest fruits of the Gustavian age of Swedish\r\nletters. His earlier efforts, indeed, express the superficial doubt and\r\npert frivolousness characteristic of his time; but in the works of his\r\nriper years he is no mere \"poet of pleasure,\" as Thorild contemptuously\r\nstyled him, but a worthy exponent of earnest moral feeling and wise\r\nhuman sympathies in felicitous and melodius verse.\r\n\r\n  His _Samlade skrifter_ (3 vols., 1796; a later edition, 1884-1885)\r\n  were revised by himself. His correspondence with Rosenstein and with\r\n  Clewberg was edited by H. Schuck (1886-1887 and 1894). See Wieselgren,\r\n  _Sveriges skona litteratur_ (1833-1849); Atterbom, _Svenska siare och\r\n  skalder_ (1841-1855); C. W. Bottiger in _Transactions of the Swedish\r\n  Academy_, xlv. 107 seq. (1870); and Gustaf Ljunggren's _Kellgren,\r\n  Leopold, och Thorild, and his Svenska vitterhetens hafder_\r\n  (1873-1877).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKELLOGG, CLARA LOUISE (1842-   ), American singer, was born at\r\nSumterville, South Carolina, in July 1842, and was educated in New York\r\nfor the musical profession, singing first in opera there in 1861. Her\r\nfine soprano voice and artistic gifts soon made her famous. She appeared\r\nas prima donna in Italian opera in London, and at concerts, in 1867 and\r\n1868; and from that time till 1887 was one of the leading public\r\nsingers. She appeared at intervals in London, but was principally\r\nengaged in America. In 1874 she organized an opera company which was\r\nwidely known in the United States, and her enterprise and energy in\r\ndirecting it were remarkable. In 1887 she married Carl Strakosch, and\r\nretired from the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKELLS, a market town of county Meath, Ireland, on the Blackwater, 9(3/4)\r\nm. N.W. of Navan on a branch of the Great Northern railway. Pop. of\r\nurban district (1901), 2428. The prosperity of the town depends chiefly\r\nupon its antiquarian remains. The most notable is St Columbkille's\r\nhouse, originally an oratory, but afterwards converted into a church,\r\nthe chancel of which was in existence in 1752. The present church is\r\nmodern, with the exception of the bell-tower, rebuilt in 1578. Near the\r\nchurch there is a fine though imperfect specimen of the ancient round\r\ntower, 99 ft. in height; and there are several ancient crosses, the\r\nfinest being that now erected in the market-place. Kells was originally\r\na royal residence, whence its ancient name _Ceanannus_, meaning the\r\n_dun_ or circular northern fort, in which the king resided, and the\r\nintermediate name _Kenlis_, meaning head fort. Here Conn of the Hundred\r\nFights resided in the 2nd century; and here was a palace of Dermot, king\r\nof Ireland, in 544-565. The other places in Ireland named Kells are\r\nprobably derived from _Cealla_, signifying church. In the 6th century\r\nKells, it is said, was granted to St Columbkille. Of the monastery which\r\nhe is reported to have founded there are no remains, and the town owes\r\nits chief ecclesiastical importance to the bishopric founded about 807,\r\nand united to Meath in the 13th century. The ecclesiastical\r\nestablishment was noted as a seat of learning, and a monument of this\r\nremains in the _Book of Kells_ an illuminated copy of the Gospels in\r\nLatin, containing also local records, dating from the 8th century, and\r\npreserved in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. The illumination is\r\nexecuted with extraordinary delicacy, and the work is asserted to be the\r\nfinest extant example of early Christian art of this kind. Neighbouring\r\nantiquities are the church of Dulane, with a fine doorway, and the _dun_\r\nor fortification of Dimor, the principal erection of a series of\r\ndefences on the hills about 6 m. W. of Kells. Among several seats in the\r\nvicinity is that of the Marquess of Headfort. Kells returned two members\r\nto the Irish parliament before the Union.",
