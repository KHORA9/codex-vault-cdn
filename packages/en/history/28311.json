In\r\naccordance with Claudio's earnest entreaty, she has sued for mercy to\r\nAngelo, the sanctimonious deputy, and in the course of her allusion to the\r\nonly terms upon which Angelo is willing to remit the sentence, she informs\r\nhim that he \"must die,\" and then continues:\r\n\r\n                  \"This outward-sainted deputy,--\r\n  Whose settled visage and deliberate word\r\n  Nips youth i' the head, and follies doth emmew,\r\n  As falcon doth the fowl,--is yet a devil;\r\n  His filth within being cast, he would appear\r\n  A pond as deep as hell.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon (according to the reading of the folio of 1623) Claudio, who is\r\naware of Angelo's reputation for sanctity, exclaims in astonishment:\r\n\r\n  \"The _prenzie_ Angelo?\"\r\n\r\nTo which Isabella replies (according to the reading of the same edition):\r\n\r\n  \"O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,\r\n  The damned'st body to invest and cover\r\n  In _prenzie_ guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,\r\n  If I would yield him my virginity,\r\n  Thou might'st be freed?\"\r\n\r\nClaudio, still incredulous, rejoins:\r\n\r\n  \"O, heavens! it cannot be.\"\r\n\r\nThe word _prenzie_ has given rise to much annotation, and it seems to be\r\nuniversally agreed that the word is a misprint. The question is, what was\r\nthe word actually written, or intended, by Shakspeare? Steevens and Malone\r\nsuggested \"princely;\" Warburton, \"priestly;\" and Tieck, \"precise.\" Mr.\r\nKnight adopts \"precise,\" the reading of Tieck, and thinks \"that, having to\r\nchoose some word which would have the double merit of agreeing with the\r\nsense of the passage and be similar in the number and form of the letters,\r\nnothing can be more unfortunate than the correction of \"princely;\" Mr.\r\nCollier, on the other hand, follows Steevens and Malone, and reads\r\n\"princely,\" observing the Tieck's reading (\"precise\") \"sounds ill as\r\nregards the metre, the accent falling on the wrong syllable. Mr. Collier's\r\nchoice is determined by the _authority_ of the second folio, which he\r\nconsiders ought to have considerable weight, whilst Mr. Knight regards the\r\nauthority of that edition as very trifling; and the only point of agreement\r\nbetween the two distinguished recent editors is with respect to Warburton's\r\nword \"priestly,\" which they both seem to think nearly conveys the meaning\r\nof the poet.\r\n\r\nI have over and over again considered the several emendations which have\r\nbeen suggested, and it seems to me that none of them answer all the\r\nnecessary conditions; namely, that the word adopted shall be (1.) suitable\r\nto the reputed character of Angelo; (2.) an appropriate epithet to the word\r\n\"guards,\" in the reply of Isabella above quoted; (3.) of the proper metre\r\nin both {402} places in which the misprint occurred; and (4.) similar in\r\nappearance to the word \"prenzie.\" \"Princely\" does not agree with the sense\r\nor spirit of the particular passage; for it is extremely improbable that\r\nClaudio, when confined under sentence of death for an absurd and\r\ninsufficient cause, would use a term of mere compliment to the man by whom\r\nhe had been doomed. \"Precise\" and \"priestly\" are both far better than\r\n\"princely;\" but \"precise\" is wholly unsuited to the metre in both places,\r\nand \"priestly\" points too much to a special character to be appropriate to\r\nAngelo's office and position. It may also be remarked, that both \"princely\"\r\nand \"priestly\" differ from the number and form of the letters contained in\r\n\"prenzie.\"\r\n\r\nThe word which I venture to suggest is \"PENSIVE,\" a word particularly\r\napplicable to a person of saintly habits, and which is so applied by Milton\r\nin \"Il Penseroso:\"\r\n\r\n  \"Come, pensive nun, devout and pure,\r\n  Sober, stedfast, and demure.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"pensive\" is stated by Dr. Johnson to mean \"sorrowfully\r\nthoughtful, sorrowfully serious,\" or melancholy; and that such epithets are\r\nappropriate to the reputed character of Angelo will be seen from the\r\nfollowing extracts:\r\n\r\n  \"I implore her, in my service, that she make friends\r\n  To the strict deputy.\"--_Claudio_, Act I. Sc. 3.\r\n\r\n  \"I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,\r\n  A man of stricture, and firm abstinence.\"--_Duke_, Act I. Sc. 4.\r\n\r\n                  \"Lord Angelo is precise;\r\n  Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses\r\n  That his blood flows, or that his appetite\r\n  Is more to bread than stone.\"--_Duke_, Act I. Sc. 4.\r\n\r\n                  \"A man, whose blood\r\n  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels\r\n  The wanton stings and motions of the sense,\r\n  But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge\r\n  With profits of the mind, study and fast.\"--_Lucio_, Act I. Sc. 5.\r\n\r\nSee also Angelo's portraiture of himself in the soliloquy at the\r\ncommencement of Act II. Sc. 4.:\r\n\r\n                  \"My gravity,\r\n  Wherein (let no man hear me) I take pride,\r\n  Could I, with boot, change for an idle plume\r\n  Which the air beats for vain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, the passage immediately under consideration:\r\n\r\n                  \"This outward-sainted deputy,\r\n  Whose settled visage and deliberate word,\r\n  Nips youth i' the head, and follies doth emmew.\"--_Isabella_, Act III.\r\n      Sc. 1.\r\n\r\nThus much as to the propriety of the word \"pensive,\" in relation to the\r\nreputed character of Angelo.\r\n\r\nThe next question is, whether the word \"pensive\" is an appropriate epithet\r\nto the word \"guards.\" If Messrs. Knight and Collier are correct in\r\nconstruing \"guards\" to mean the \"trimmings or border of robe,\" this\r\nquestion must be answered in the negative. But it appears to me that they\r\nare in error, and that the true meaning of the word \"guards,\" in this\r\nparticular passage, is \"outward appearances,\" as suggested by Monck Mason;\r\nand, consequently, that the expression \"pensive guards\" means a grave or\r\nsanctified countenance or demeanour--\"the settled visage and deliberate\r\nword\" which \"nips youth i' the head, and follies doth emmew.\"\r\n\r\nIt requires no argument to establish that the word \"pensive\" is suitable to\r\nthe metre in both places in which the misprint occurred and it is equally\r\nclear that \"prenzie\" and \"pensive\" in manuscript are so similar, both in\r\nthe number, form, and character of the letters, that the one might easily\r\nbe printed for the other. The two words also have a certain resemblance, in\r\npoint of sound; and if the word \"pensive\" be not very distinctly\r\npronounced, the mistake might be made by a scribe writing from dictation.\r\n\r\nReferring to Mrs. Cowden Clarke's admirable concordance of Shakspeare, it\r\nappears that the word \"pensive\" is used by Shakspeare in the _text_ of his\r\nplays twice; namely, in _Romeo and Juliet_, Act IV. Sc. 1., where Friar\r\nLaurence addresses Juliet thus:\r\n\r\n  \"My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\"\r\n\r\nand again, in the Third Part of _Henry VI_., Act IV. Sc. 1., where Clarence\r\nis thus addressed by King Edward upon the subject of his marriage with the\r\nLady Grey:\r\n\r\n  \"Now, brother Clarence, how like you our choice,\r\n  That you stand pensive, as half mal-content?\"\r\n\r\nI also find that, according to the stage directions (both ancient and\r\nmodern) of Act II. Sc 2. of _Henry VIII_. (see Collier's _Shakspeare_, vol.\r\nv. p. 534., _note_), the king is described to be found \"reading pensively,\"\r\nat a moment when he is meditating his divorce from Katharine of Arragon,\r\nnot \"because the marriage of his brother's wife had crept too near his\r\nconscience,\" but \"because his conscience had crept too near another lady.\"\r\n\r\nI might extend the argument by further observations upon the reference last\r\ncited, but not without risk of losing all chance of a place in \"NOTES AND\r\nQUERIES.\"\r\n\r\nQuery, Whether pen_s_ive was ever written or printed pen_z_ive in\r\nShakspeare's time? If so, that word would bear a still closer resemblance\r\nto \"prenzie.\"\r\n\r\nLEGES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRHYMING LATIN VERSION OF THE SONG ON ROBIN GOODFELLOW.\r\n\r\nIn the same MS. from which I extracted Braithwait's Latin Drinking Song,\r\nthe following version {403} of the well-known song on Robin Goodfellow\r\noccurs. It is apparently by the same hand. I give the English, as it\r\ncontains but six stanzas, and affords some variations from the copy printed\r\nby Percy; and indeed one stanza not given by him. Peck attributes the song\r\nto Ben Jonson, but we know not on what foundation. It must be confessed\r\nthat internal evidence is against it. The publication of Percy's _Reliques_\r\nhad a no less beneficial influence on the literature of Germany than it had\r\non our own; and Voss had given an admirable version of nine stanzas of this\r\nsong as early as the year 1793. The first stanza will afford some notion of\r\nhis manner:\r\n\r\n    \"Von Oberon in Feenland,\r\n    Dem Koenige der Geister,\r\n  Komm' ich, Knecht Robert, abgesandt,\r\n    Von meinem Herrn und Meister.\r\n      Als Kobolt und Pux,\r\n      Wohlkundig des Spuks,\r\n    Durchschwarm' ich Nacht vor Nacht.\r\n      Jezt misch' ich mich ein\r\n      Zum polternden Reihn,\r\n    Wohlauf, ihr alle, gelacht, gelacht!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the classic ear may be offended by the \"barbarous adjunct of\r\nrhyme,\" and by the solecisms and false quantities which sometimes occur,\r\n\"et alia multa damna atque outragia,\" others may be amused with these\r\nemulations of the cloistered muse of the Middle Ages. The witty author of\r\n_Whistlecraft_ has shown that he had a true relish for them, and has\r\nsuccessfully tried his hand, observing at the same time:\r\n\r\n  \"Those monks were poor proficients in divinity,\r\n    And scarce knew more of Latin than myself;\r\n  Compar'd with theirs, they say that true Latinity\r\n    Appears like porcelain compar'd with delf.\"\r\n\r\nHonest Barnaby had no intention of rivalling Horace: his humbler, but not\r\nless amusing, prototypes were Walter de Mapes and his cotemporaries. We may\r\naccept his own defence, if any is needed:\r\n\r\n  \"That paltry Patcher is a bald translator,\r\n  Whose awl bores at the _words_ but not the matter;\r\n  But this TRANSLATOR makes good use of leather,\r\n  By stitching _rhyme_ and _reason_ both together.\"\r\n\r\nS. W. SINGER.\r\n\r\nA SONG ON ROBIN GOODFELLOW.\r\n\r\n  \"From Oberon in faery-land,\r\n  The king of ghosts and goblins there,\r\n  Mad Robin I, at his command,\r\n  Am sent to view the night-sports here.\r\n  What revel rout is here about,\r\n  In every corner where I go;\r\n  I will it see, and merry be,\r\n  And make good sport with ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"As swift as lightning I do fly\r\n  Amidst the aery welkin soon,\r\n  And, in a minute's space, descry\r\n  What things are done below the moon.\r\n  There's neither hag nor spirit shall wag,\r\n  In any corner where I go;\r\n  But Robin I, their feats will spy,\r\n  And make good sport with ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"Sometimes you find me like a man,\r\n  Sometimes a hawk, sometimes a hound,\r\n  Then to a horse me turn I can,\r\n  And trip and troll about you round:\r\n  But if you stride my back to ride,\r\n  As swift as air I with you go,\r\n  O'er hedge, o'er lands, o'er pool, o'er ponds,\r\n  I run out laughing ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"When lads and lasses merry be,\r\n  With possets and with junkets fine;\r\n  Unknown to all the company,\r\n  I eat their cake and drink their wine;\r\n  Then to make sport, I snore and snort,\r\n  And all the candles out I blow;\r\n  The maids I kiss; they ask who's this?\r\n  I answer, laughing, ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"If that my fellow elf and I\r\n  In circle dance do trip it round,\r\n  And if we chance, by any eye\r\n  There present, to be seen or found,\r\n  Then if that they do speak or say,\r\n  But mummes continue as they go,[1]\r\n  Then night by night I them affright,\r\n  With pinches, dreams, and ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"Since hag-bred Merlin's time have I\r\n  Continued night-sports to and fro,\r\n  That, for my pranks, men call me by\r\n  The name of Robin Goodfellow.\r\n  There's neither hag nor spirit doth wag,\r\n  The fiends and goblins do me know;\r\n  And beldames old my tales have told;\r\n  Sing Vale, Vale, ho, ho, ho!\"\r\n\r\n_The Latine of the foregoing verses_.\r\n\r\n  \"Ab Oberone lemurum\r\n  Coemetriorum regulo,\r\n  Spectator veni lubricum,\r\n  Illius jussu, Robbio;\r\n  Quodcunque joci, sit hic loci,\r\n  Quocunque vado in angulo,\r\n  Id speculabor, et conjocabor,\r\n  Sonorem boans, ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"Praeceps feror per aerem\r\n  Telo trisulco citius,\r\n  Et translunaria penetrem\r\n  Momento brevi ocyus;\r\n  Larvatus frater non vagatur\r\n  Quocunque vado in angulo,\r\n  Nam Robbio, huic obvio,\r\n  Et facta exploro, ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"Nunc canis nunc accipiter,\r\n  Et homo nunc obambulo,\r\n  Nunc equi forma induor\r\n  Et levis circumcursito;\r\n  {404}\r\n  Si quis me prendat, et ascendat,\r\n  Velocius aura rapio,\r\n  Per prata, montes, vada, fontes,\r\n  Risumque tollo, ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"Cum juvenes convivio\r\n  Admiscent se puellulis,\r\n  Ignotus vinum haurio\r\n  Et impleor bellariis;\r\n  Tunc sterto, strepo, et dum crepo,\r\n  Lucernam flatu adventillo,\r\n  Haec basiatur; hic quis? clamatur,\r\n  Cachinnans reddo, ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"Si quando cum consorte larva\r\n  In circulum tripudio,\r\n  Et observemur nos per arva\r\n  Acutiori oculo;\r\n  Et si spectator eloquatur\r\n  Nec os obhaeret digito,\r\n  Nocte terremus et torquemus\r\n  Ungue spectris, ho, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n  \"Post incubiginam Merlinum\r\n  Nocturni feci ludicra,\r\n  Et combibonem me Robbinum\r\n  Vocent ob jocularia,\r\n  Me daemones, me lemures,\r\n  Me novite tenebrio,\r\n  Decantant me veneficae;\r\n  Vale!

We should probably read\r\n_or_ instead of _but_. _Mummes_ may mean _mumbling_, muttering.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOLK LORE.\r\n\r\nDEVONSHIRE FOLK LORE.\r\n\r\n1. _Storms from Conjuring_.--A common Devonshire remark on the rising of a\r\nstorm is, \"Ah! there is a conjuring going on somewhere.\" The following\r\nillustration was told me by an old inhabitant of this parish. In the parish\r\nof St. Mary Tavy is a spot called \"Steven's grave,\" from a suicide said to\r\nhave been buried there. His spirit proving troublesome to the\r\nneighbourhood, was laid by a former curate on Sunday after afternoon\r\nservice. A man who accompanied the clergyman on the way was told by him to\r\nmake haste home, as a storm was coming. The man hurried away home; but\r\nthough the afternoon had previously been very fine, he had scarcely reached\r\nhis door before a violent thunderstorm came to verify the clergyman's\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n2. _The Heath-hounds_.--The _brutende heer_ are sometimes heard near\r\nDartmoor, and are known by the appellation of \"Heath-hounds.\" They were\r\nheard in the parish of St. Mary Tavy several years ago by an old man called\r\nRoger Burn: he was working in the fields, when he suddenly heard the baying\r\nof the hounds, the shouts and horn of the huntsman, and the smacking of his\r\nwhip. This last point the old man quoted as at once settling the question.\r\n\"How could I be mistaken? why I heard the very smacking of his whip.\"\r\n\r\n3. _Cock scares the Fiend_.--Mr. N. was a Devonshire squire who had been so\r\nunfortunate as to sell his soul to the devil, with the condition that after\r\nhis funeral the fiend should take possession of his skin. He had also\r\npersuaded a neighbour to undertake to be present on the occasion of the\r\nflaying. On the death of Mr. N., this man went in a state of great alarm to\r\nthe parson of the parish, and asked his advice. By him he was told to\r\nfulfil his engagement, but he must be sure and carry a cock into the church\r\nwith him. On the night after the funeral, the man proceeded to the church\r\narmed with the cock; and, as an additional security, took up his position\r\nin the parson's pew. At twelve o'clock the devil arrived, opened the grave,\r\ntook the corpse from the coffin and flayed it. When the operation was\r\nconcluded, he held the skin up before him, and remarked: \"Well! 'twas not\r\nworth coming for after all, for it is all full of holes!\" As he said this,\r\nthe cock crew; whereupon the fiend, turning round to the man, exclaimed:\r\n\"If it had not been for the bird you have got there under your arm, I would\r\nhave your skin too.\" But, thanks to the cock, the man got home safe again.\r\n\r\n4. _Cranmere Pool_.--Cranmere Pool, in the centre of Dartmoor, is a great\r\npenal settlement for refractory spirits. Many of the former inhabitants of\r\nthis parish are still there expiating their ghostly pranks. An old farmer\r\nwas so troublesome to his survivors as to require seven clergymen to secure\r\nhim. By their means, however, he was transformed into a colt; and a servant\r\nboy was directed to take him to Cranmere Pool. On arriving at the brink of\r\nthe pool, he was to take off the halter, and return instantly without\r\nlooking round. Curiosity proving too powerful, he turned his head to see\r\nwhat was going on, when he beheld the colt plunge into the lake in the form\r\nof a ball of fire. Before doing so, however, he gave the lad a parting\r\nsalute in the form of a kick, which knocked out one of his eyes.\r\n\r\nJ. M. (4.)\r\n\r\nSt. Mary Tavy, May 5. 1851.\r\n\r\n_St. Uncumber and the offering of Oats_ (Vol. ii., pp. 286. 342. 381.).--A\r\nfurther illustration of this custom is found in the legend of St.\r\nRhadegund, or at least in the metrical version of it, which is commonly\r\nascribed to Henry Bradshaw. A copy of this very scarce poem, from the press\r\nof Pynson, is preserved in the library of Jesus College, Cambridge. We\r\nthere read as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Among all myracles after our intelligence\r\n    Which Radegunde shewed by her humilite,\r\n  One is moost vsuall had in experience\r\n    Among the common people noted with hert fre\r\n  _By offeryng of otes_ after theyr degre\r\n    At her holy aulters where myracles in sight\r\n    Dayly haue be done by grace day and nyght.\r\n\r\n  {405}\r\n  \"_By oblacion of othes_, halt lame and blynde\r\n    Hath ben restored vnto prosperite;\r\n  Dombe men to speke aboue cours of kynde\r\n    Sickemen delyuered from payne and miserie,\r\n    Maydens hath kept theyr pure virginite,\r\n    Wyddowes defended from greuous oppression,\r\n    And clarkes exalted by her to promocion.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also remarkable that a _reason_ exists in the story of this saint for\r\nthe choice of so strange an offering. As she was escaping from her husband,\r\na crop of _oats_ sprang up miraculously, to testify in her behalf, and to\r\nsilence the messengers who had been sent to turn her from her purpose.\r\n\r\nOn this account is there not room for the conjecture that _St. Rhadegund_\r\nis the original St. Uncumber, and that the custom of offering oats at\r\nPoules, when a wife was weary of her husband, is traceable to the story of\r\nthe French queen, who died in 587.\r\n\r\nC.

JAMES BUCKMAN\r\n(Vol. iii., p. 320.) of \"old wives' remedies,\" based on the above\r\nprinciple, would, I imagine, be of endless length; but the following\r\nextract from the _Herbal_ of Sir John Hill, M.D., \"Fellow of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Sciences at Bordeaux,\" published in 1789, will show at how late\r\na period such notions have been entertained by men of education and even\r\nscientific attainment:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is to be observed that nature seems to have set her stamp upon\r\n    several herbs, which have the virtue to stop bleedings; this\r\n    [cranesbill] and the tutsan, the two best remedies the fields afford\r\n    for outward and inward bleedings, become all over as red as blood at a\r\n    certain season.\"\r\n\r\nSELEUCUS.\r\n\r\n_Cure of large Neck_.--I send you two remedies in use here for the cure of\r\na common complaint, called \"large neck.\" Perhaps they may be worthy of a\r\nplace in your \"Folk Lore.\"\r\n\r\nA common snake, held by its head and tail, is slowly drawn, by some one\r\nstanding by, nine times across the front part of the neck of the person\r\naffected, the reptile being allowed, after every third time, to crawl about\r\nfor a while. Afterwards the snake is put alive into a bottle, which is\r\ncorked tightly and then buried in the ground. The tradition is, that as the\r\nsnake decays the swelling vanishes.\r\n\r\nThe second mode of treatment is just the same as the above, with the\r\nexception of the snake's doom. In this case it is killed, and its skin,\r\nsewn in a piece of silk, is worn round the diseased neck.

Thinking that the explosion in \"NOTES AND\r\nQUERIES\" would do no harm, but perhaps some good, a note was kindly\r\npermitted to be taken of it for that publication. It was evidently written\r\nsoon after the appearance of the _Library Companion._\r\n\r\n    \"_Sundry Errors discovered in the Library Companion, recently put forth\r\n    by the Rev. T. F.

In two notes (pp. 37,\r\n    38.), comprised in twelve lines, occur _fifteen_ remarkable blunders,\r\n    such as any intelligent bookseller could, without much trouble, have\r\n    corrected for the Rev. and learned author.\r\n\r\n    \"Henry's _Exposition of the Old and New Testaments_ first appeared\r\n    collectively in 1710[2], five[3] vols. folio; but the recent edition of\r\n    1810[4], in six vols. 4to., is the best[5], as the last volume\r\n    contains[6] additional matter from the author's MSS. left at his\r\n    decease.--Dr. Gill's _Exposition of the New Testament_ was published in\r\n    1746, &c., three vols. folio; of the Old, in 1748[7], &c., nine[8]\r\n    vols. folio; but the work advancing in reputation and price, became\r\n    rare, so as to induce Mr. Bagster[9] to put forth a new edition of the\r\n    whole, in ten[10] vols. 4to.

The\r\nThames watermen rejoice in the dress of Elizabeth: while the royal\r\nbeefeaters (buffetiers) wear that of private soldiers of the time of Henry\r\nVII.; the blue-coat boy, the costume of a London citizen of the reign of\r\nEdward VI.; the London charity-school girls, the plain mob cap and long\r\ngloves of the time of Queen Anne. In the brass badge of the cabmen, we see\r\na retention of the dress of Elizabethan retainers: while the shoulder-knots\r\nthat once decked an officer now adorn a footman. The attire of the sailor\r\nof William III.'s era is now seen amongst our fishermen. The university\r\ndress is as old as the age of the Smithfield martyrs. The linen bands of\r\nthe pulpit and the bar are abridgments of the falling collar.\r\n\r\nOther costumes are found lurking in provinces, and amongst some trades. The\r\nbutchers' blue is the uniform of a guild. The quaint little head-dress of\r\nthe market women of Kingswood, Gloucestershire, is in fact the gipsy hat of\r\nGeorge II. Scarlet has been the colour of soldiers' uniform from the time\r\nof the Lacedemonians. The blue of the army we derived from the Puritans; of\r\nthe navy from the colours of a mistress of George I.\r\n\r\nTORRO.\r\n\r\n_Curious Omen at Marriage_.--In Miss Benger's _Memoirs of Elizabeth, Queen\r\nof Bohemia_, it is mentioned that,--\r\n\r\n    \"It is by several writers observed that, towards the close of the\r\n    ceremony, _certain coruscations of joy_ appeared in Elizabeth's face,\r\n    which were afterwards supposed to be sinister presages of her\r\n    misfortunes.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note, Echard is alluded to as the authority for this singular\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nCan any of your readers explain _why_ such a _coruscation of joy_ upon a\r\nwedding day should forebode evil? or whether any other instances are on\r\nrecord of its so doing?\r\n\r\nH.

B., Author of the History of the Wars of England, &c._,\r\nRemarks of London, &c., 12mo., 1684, p. 137. It may serve as a pendant to\r\nthe ventriloquist hoax mentioned by C. H., Vol. ii., p. 101.:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have a letter by me, saith Mr. Clark, dated July 7, 1606, written by\r\n    one Mr. Bovy to a minister in London, where he thus writes: 'Touching\r\n    news, you shall understand that Mr. Sherwood hath received a letter\r\n    from Mr. Arthur Hildersham, which containeth this following narrative:\r\n    that at Brampton, in the parish of Torksey, near Gainsborough in\r\n    Lincolnshire, an ash-tree shaketh both in the body and boughs thereof,\r\n    and there proceed from thence sighs and groans, like those of a man\r\n    troubled in his sleep, as if it felt some sensible torment. Many have\r\n    climbed to the top thereof, where they heard the groans more plainly\r\n    than they could below. One among the rest being a-top, spoke to the\r\n    tree; but presently came down much astonished, and lay grovelling on\r\n    the earth speechless for three hours, and then reviving said,\r\n    _Brampton, Brampton,_ thou art much bound to pray.' The author of this\r\n    news is one Mr. Vaughan, a minister who was there present and heard and\r\n    saw these passages, and told Mr. Hildersham of it. The Earl of Lincoln\r\n    caused one of the arms of the ash to be lopped off, and a hole to be\r\n    bored into the body, and then was the sound or hollow voice heard more\r\n    audibly than before; but in a kind of speech which they could not\r\n    comprehend nor understand.\"\r\n\r\nK.

Now, Barker, who preceded\r\nBurford, and eventually, I think, entered into partnership with him,\r\nmarried a friend of my family, a daughter of the Admiral Bligh against whom\r\nhad been the mutiny in the _Bounty_. I remember Mr. Barker, and his house\r\nin Surrey Square, or some small square on the Surrey side of London Bridge;\r\nalso its wooden rotunda for painting in; and this, too, at the time when\r\nthe picture of Spitzbergen was in progress {407} and you felt almost a\r\nchill as the transparent icebergs were splashed on.\r\n\r\nIf there have not been two Messrs.

DOWNING BRUCE, F.S.A.\r\n\r\nMiddle Temple.\r\n\r\n_Legend represented in Frettenham Church._--Perhaps some one of your\r\nnumerous readers may {408} be able to give an explanation of the following\r\nlegend, for such I suppose it to be:--\r\n\r\nIn the parish church of Frettenham, co. Norfolk, several alabaster carvings\r\nwere discovered some years ago, near the chancel arch, having traces of\r\ncolour. The most perfect, and the one which had most claims to merit as a\r\npiece of sculpture, represented a very curious scene. A horse was standing\r\nfixed in a kind of stocks, a machine for holding animals fast while they\r\nwere being shod. But it (the horse) had only three legs: close by stood a\r\nBishop, or mitred Abbot, holding the horse's missing fore quarter, on the\r\nhoof of which a smith was nailing a shoe. Of course the power which had so\r\neasily removed a leg would as easily replace it.\r\n\r\nThe details of the story may be very safely conjectured to have been--a\r\nBishop or high church dignitary is going on a journey or pilgrimage; his\r\nhorse drops a shoe; on being taken to a smith's to have it replaced, the\r\nanimal becomes restive, and cannot be shod even with the help of the\r\nstocks; whereupon the bishop facilitates the operation in the manner before\r\ndescribed. One feels tempted to ask why he could not have replaced the shoe\r\nwithout the smith's intervention.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know is, of whom is this story told? I regret that not\r\nhaving seen the carving in question, I can give no particulars of dress,\r\n&c., which might help to determine its age; nor could my informant, though\r\nhe perfectly well remembered the subject represented. He told me that he\r\nhad often mentioned it to people likely to know of the existence of such a\r\nlegend, but could never gain any information respecting it.\r\n\r\nC. J. E.\r\n\r\nKing's Col.

I find the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n    \"The act of Sardanapalus in making his palace his own funeral pyre and\r\n    burning himself upon it, is also attributed to the king who was\r\n    overthrown by Cyaxares.\"\r\n\r\nMay I ask where the authority for this statement is to be found?\r\n\r\nX.

The only explanation I have seen of its origin is given in\r\nBarrington's _Observations on the more Ancient Statutes_, p. 474., on 3\r\nHen. VIII., where, after referring in the text to a statute by which\r\nsurgeons were exempted from attendance on juries, he adds in a note:\r\n\r\n    \"It may perhaps be thought singular to suppose that this exemption from\r\n    serving on juries is the foundation of the vulgar error, that a surgeon\r\n    or butcher from the barbarity of their business may be challenged as\r\n    jurors.\"\r\n\r\nSir H. Spelman, in his _Answer to an Apology for Archbishop Abbott_,\r\nsays,--\r\n\r\n    \"In our law, those that were exercised in slaughter of beasts, were not\r\n    received to be triers of the life of a man.\"--_Posth. Works_, p. 112.;\r\n    _St. Trials_, vol. ii. p. 1171.\r\n\r\nSo learned a man as Spelman must, I think, have had some ground for this\r\nstatement, and could scarcely be repeating a vulgar error taking its rise\r\nfrom a statute then hardly more than a hundred years old. I hope some of\r\nyour readers will be able to give a more satisfactory explanation than\r\nBarrington's.\r\n\r\nE. S. T.

The egg answers exactly the description given of that of\r\nthe redwing thrush, both in Bewick and Wood's _British Song Birds;_ being\r\nbluish-green, with a few largish spots of a dark brown colour. The nest was\r\nnot lined with mud, as is usually the case with a blackbird's, but with\r\nmoss and dried grass.\r\n\r\nHas the egg of the redwing been ever seen in this situation before?\r\n\r\nC.

C.\r\n\r\n_Who were the Writers in the North Briton?_--The _Athenaeum_ of Saturday,\r\nMay 17, contains a very interesting article on the recently published\r\n_Correspondence of Horace Walpole with Mason_, in which certain very\r\npalpable hits are made as to the identity of Mason and Junius. In the\r\ncourse of the article the following Query occurs:\r\n\r\n    \"In the second Part of the folio edition of the _North Briton_\r\n    published by Bingley, in the British Museum, are inserted two folio\r\n    pages of manuscript thus headed:--\r\n\r\n    'The Extraordinary\r\n    NORTH BRITON.\r\n    By W. M.'\r\n\r\n    This manuscript is professedly a copy from a publication issued June\r\n    3rd, 1768, by Staples Steare, 93. Fleet Street, price three-pence. It\r\n    is a letter addressed to Lord Mansfield, and an appeal in favour of\r\n    Wilkes, on whom, the writer says, judgment is this day to be\r\n    pronounced. It is written somewhat in the style of Junius. The satire\r\n    is so refined that the reader does not at first suspect that it is\r\n    satire,--as in Junius's _Letters_, wherein the satirical compliments to\r\n    the King have been mistaken for praise, and quoted in proof of\r\n    inconsistency.\r\n\r\n    \"Who was this 'W. M.'? Who were the writers in the _North Briton?_--not\r\n    only 'The Extraordinary' _North Briton_, published by Steare, but the\r\n    genuine _North Briton_, published by Bingley.

C. wishes to know whether bondage was a reality in\r\nthe time of Philip and Mary; and, if so, when it became extinct. It was a\r\nreality much later than that, as several cases in the books will show.\r\nDyer, who was appointed chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1559,\r\nsettled several in which man claimed property in his fellow-man, hearing\r\narguments and giving judgment on the point whether one should be a \"villein\r\nregardant\" or a \"villein in gross.\" Lord Campbell, in his _Lives of the\r\nChief Justices_, gives the following, tried before Dyer, _C.J._:\r\n\r\n    \"A. B., seised in fee of a manor to which a villein was regardant, made\r\n    a feoffment of one acre of the manor by these words: 'I have given one\r\n    acre, &c., and further I have given and granted, &c., John S., my\r\n    villein.' Question, 'Does the villein pass to the grantee as a villein\r\n    in gross, or as a villein appendant to that acre?' The Court being\r\n    equally divided in opinion, no judgment seems to have been\r\n    given.\"--_Dyer_, 48 b. pl. 2.\r\n\r\nAnother action was brought before him under these circumstances:--Butler,\r\nLord of the Manor of Badminton, in the county of Gloucester, contending\r\nthat Crouch was his villein regardant, entered into certain lands, which\r\nCrouch had purchased in Somersetshire, and leased them to Fleyer. Crouch\r\nthereupon disseised Fleyer, who brought his action against Crouch, pleading\r\nthat Butler and his ancestors were seised of Crouch and his ancestors as of\r\nvilleins regardant, from time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the\r\ncontrary. The jury found that Butler and his ancestors were seised of\r\nCrouch and his ancestors until the first year of the reign of Henry VII.;\r\nbut, confessing themselves ignorant whether in point of law such seisin be\r\nan actual seisin of the defendant, prayed the opinion of the Court thereon.\r\nDyer, _C.J._, and the other judges agreed upon this to a verdict for the\r\ndefendant, for \"the lord having let an hundred years pass without redeeming\r\nthe villein or his issue, cannot, after that, claim them.\" (_Dyer_, 266.\r\npl. 11.)\r\n\r\nWhen Holt was chief justice of the King's Bench, an action was tried before\r\nhim to recover the price of a slave who had been sold in Virginia. The\r\nverdict went for the plaintiff. In deciding upon a motion made in arrest of\r\njudgment, Holt, _C.J._, said,--\"As soon as a negro comes into England he is\r\nfree: one may be a villein in England, but not a slave.\" (_Cases temp.\r\nHolt_, 405.)\r\n\r\nAs to the period at which villenage in England became extinct, we find in\r\n_Litt_. (sec. 185.):--\r\n\r\n    \"Villenage is supposed to have finally disappeared in the reign of\r\n    James I., but there is great difficulty in saying when it ceased to be\r\n    lawful, for there has been no statute to abolish it; and by the old\r\n    law, if any freeman acknowledged himself in a court of record to be a\r\n    villein, he and all his after-born issue and their descendants were\r\n    villeins.\"\r\n\r\nEven so late as the middle of the eighteenth century, when the great Lord\r\nMansfield adorned {411} the bench, it was pleaded \"that villenage, or\r\nslavery, had been permitted in England by the common law; that no statute\r\nhad ever passed to abolish this _status_;\" and that \"although _de facto_\r\nvillenage by birth had ceased, a man might still make himself a villein by\r\nacknowledgment in a court of record.\" This was in the celebrated case of\r\nthe negro Somersett, in which Lord Mansfield first established that \"the\r\nair of England had long been too pure for a slave.\" In his judgment he\r\nsays,--\r\n\r\n    \"... Then what ground is there for saying that the _status_ of slavery\r\n    is now recognised by the law of England?... At any rate, villenage has\r\n    ceased in England, and it cannot be revived.\"--_St. Tr._, vol. xx. pp.\r\n    1-82.\r\n\r\nAnd Macaulay, in his admirable _History of England_, speaking of the\r\ngradual and silent extinction of villenage, then, towards the close of the\r\nTudor period, fast approaching completion, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Some faint traces of the institution of villenage were detected by the\r\n    curious as late as the days of the Stuarts; nor has that institution\r\n    ever to this hour been abolished by statute.\"\r\n\r\nTEE BEE.\r\n\r\n_Villenage_ (Vol. iii., p. 327.).--In reply to the question put by H. C., I\r\nbeg to say that in Burton's _Leicestershire_ (published in 1622), a copy of\r\nwhich is now before me, some curious remarks occur on this subject. Burton\r\nsays, under the head of \"Houghton-on-the-Hill,\" that the last case he could\r\nfind in print, concerning the claim to a villein, was in Mich. 9 & 10 Eliz.\r\n(_Dyer_, 266. b.), where one Butler, Lord of the Manor of Badminton in\r\nGloucestershire, did claim one Crouch for his villein regardant to his said\r\nmanor, and made an entry upon Crouch's lands in Somersetshire. Upon an\r\nanswer made by Crouch, an _ejectione firmae_ was brought in the King's\r\nBench; and upon the evidence it was moved, that as no seizure of the body\r\nhad been made, or claim set up by the lord, for sixty years preceding, none\r\ncould then be made. The Court held, in accordance with this, that no\r\nseizure could be made. I do not know what the reference means; perhaps some\r\nof your legal correspondents may do so.\r\n\r\nJAYTEE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMACLEAN NOT JUNIUS.\r\n\r\n(Vol. iii., p. 378.)\r\n\r\nYour correspondent AEGROTUS (_ante_, p. 378.) is not justified in writing\r\nso confidently on a subject respecting which he is so little informed. He\r\nis evidently not even aware that the claims of Maclean have been ably and\r\nelaborately set forth by Sir David Brewster, and, as I think, conclusively,\r\non the evidence, set aside in the _Athenaeum_. He has, however, been\r\npleased to new vamp some old stories, to which he gives something of\r\nnovelty by telling them \"with a difference.\" I remember, indeed, four or\r\nfive years since, to have seen a letter on this subject, written by Mr.\r\nPickering, the bookseller, to the late Sir Harris Nicolas, in which the\r\nsame statements were made, supported by the same authorities,--which, in\r\nfact, corresponded so exactly with the communication of AEGROTUS, that I\r\nmust believe either that your correspondent has seen that letter, or that\r\nboth writers had their information from a common story-teller.\r\n\r\nRespecting the \"vellum-bound copy\" locked up in the ebony cabinet in\r\npossession of the late Marquis of Lansdowne, Mr. Pickering's version came\r\nnearer to the authority; for he said, \"_My informant saw_ the bound volumes\r\nand the cabinet _when a boy_.\" The proof then rests on the recollection of\r\nan Anonymous, who speaks positively as to what took place nearly half a\r\ncentury since; and this anonymous boy, we are to believe, was already so\r\ninterested about Junius as to notice the fact at the time, and remember it\r\never after. Against the probabilities of this we might urge, that the\r\npresent Marquis--who was born in 1780, and came to the title in 1809, is\r\nprobably as old, or older than Anonymous; as much interested in a question\r\nbelieved by many persons, AEGROTUS amongst them, intimately to concern his\r\nfather, and quite as precocious, for he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in\r\n1805--never saw or heard of either the volumes or the cabinet; and, as\r\nAEGROTUS admits, after a search expressly made by his order, they could not\r\nbe found. Further, allow me to remind you, that it is not more than six\r\nweeks since it was recorded in \"NOTES AND QUERIES\" that a \"vellum-bound\"\r\nJunius was lately sold at Stowe; and it is about two months since I learnt,\r\non the same authority, that a Mr. Cramp had asserted that vellum-bound\r\ncopies were so common, that the printer must have taken the Junius copy as\r\na pattern; so that, if AEGROTUS'S facts be admitted, they would prove\r\nnothing. There is one circumstance, however, bearing on this question,\r\nwhich perhaps AEGROTUS himself will think entitled to some weight. It was\r\nnot until 1812, when George Woodfall published the private letters of\r\nJunius, that the public first heard about \"a vellum-bound\" copy. If\r\ntherefore the Anonymous knew before 1809 that some special interest did or\r\nwould attach more to one vellum-bound book than another, he must be Junius\r\nhimself; for Sampson Woodfall was dead, and when living had said nothing\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nAEGROTUS then favours us with the anecdote about \"old Mr. Cox\" the printer,\r\nand that Maclean corrected the proofs of _Junius' Letters_ at his\r\nprinting-office. Of course, persons acquainted with the subject have heard\r\nthe story before, though not with all the circumstantialities now given.\r\nWhere, I might ask, is the authority for {412} this story? Who is\r\nresponsible for it? But the emphatic question which common sense will ask\r\nis this: Why should Junius go to Mr. Cox's printing-office to correct his\r\nproofs? Where he wrote the letters he might surely have corrected the\r\nproofs. Why, after all his trouble, anxiety, and mystification to keep the\r\nsecret, should he needlessly go to anybody's printing-office to correct the\r\nproofs, and thus wantonly risk the consequences?--in fact, go there and\r\nbetray himself, as we are expected to believe he did? The story is absurd,\r\non the face of it. But what authority has AEGROTUS for asserting that\r\nJunius corrected proofs at all? Strong presumptive evidence leads me to\r\nbelieve that he did not: in some instances he could not. In one instance he\r\nspecially desired to have a proof; but it was, as we now know, for the\r\npurpose of forwarding it to Lord Chatham. Junius was also anxious to have\r\nproofs of the Dedication and Preface, but it is by no means certain that he\r\nhad them; the evidence tends to show that they were, at Woodfall's request,\r\nand to remove from his own shoulders the threatened responsibility, read by\r\nWilkes: and the collected edition was printed from Wheble's edition, so far\r\nas it went, and the remainder from slips cut from the _Public Advertiser_,\r\nboth corrected by Junius; but we have no reason to believe that Junius ever\r\nsaw a proof, even of the collected edition,--many reasons that tend\r\nstrongly to the contrary opinion. Under these circumstances, we are\r\nrequired to believe an anonymous story, which runs counter to all evidence,\r\nthat we may superadd an absurdity.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickering further referred to Mr. Raphael West, as one who \"could tell\r\nmuch on the subject.\" Here AEGROTUS enlarges on the original, and tells us\r\nwhat this \"much\" consisted of. The story, professedly told by Benjamin\r\nWest, about Maclean and Junius, on which Sir David Brewster founded his\r\ntheory, may be found in Galt's _Life of West_. But Galt himself, in his\r\nsubsequent autobiography, admits that the story told by West \"does not\r\nrelate the actual circumstances of the case correctly;\" that is to say,\r\nGalt had found out, in the interval, that it was open to contradiction and\r\ndisproof, and it has since been disproved in the _Athenaeum_. So much for a\r\nstory discredited by the narrator himself. Of these facts AEGROTUS is\r\nentirely ignorant, and therefore proceeds by the following extraordinary\r\ncircumstantialities to uphold it. \"The late President of the Royal Academy\r\nknew Maclean; and his son, the late Raphael West, _told the writer of these\r\nremarks_ [AEGROTUS himself] that _when a young man_ he had seen him\r\n[Maclean] in the evening at his father's house in Newman Street, and _once\r\nheard him repeat a passage in one of the letters which was not then\r\npublished_;\" and AEGROTUS adds, \"a more correct and veracious man than Mr.\r\nR. West could not be.\" So be it. Still it is strange that the President,\r\nwho was said to have told his anecdote expressly to show that Maclean was\r\nJunius, never thought to confirm it by the conclusive proof of having read\r\nthe letters before they were published! Further,--and we leave the question\r\nof extreme accuracy and _veraciousness_ to be settled by AEGROTUS,--the\r\nPresident West was born in 1738; he embarked from America for Italy in\r\n1759; on his return he visited England in 1763, and such was the patronage\r\nwith which he was welcomed, that his friends recommended him to take up his\r\nresidence in London. This he was willing to do, provided a young American\r\nlady to whom he was attached would come to England. She consented; his\r\nfather accompanied her, and they were married on the 2nd of September,\r\n1765, at St. Martin's Church. Now Maclean embarked for India in December,\r\n1773, or January, 1774, and was lost at sea, when \"the young man,\" Master\r\nRaphael, could not have been more than seven years of age,--nay, to speak\r\nby the card, as Master Raphael heard one of Junius' letters read before it\r\nwas published, and as the last was published in January, 1772, it follows,\r\nassuming that he was the eldest child, born in nine months to the hour, and\r\nthat it was the very last letter that he heard read, he _may have been_\r\nfive years and seven months old--a very \"young man\" indeed; or rather, all\r\ncircumstances considered, as precocious a youth as he who found out the\r\nvellum-bound copy years before it was known to be in existence.\r\n\r\nI regret to have occupied so much of your space. But speculation on this\r\nsubject is just now the fashion. \"NOTES AND QUERIES\" is likely hereafter to\r\nbecome an authority, and if these circumstantial statements are admitted\r\ninto its columns, they must be as circumstantially disproved.\r\n\r\nM.

Stillingfleet's\r\n_Controversies with Godden, Author of \"Catholics no Idolaters,\" and_ {413}\r\n_with Gother, Author of \"The Papist Misrepresented,\" &c._\r\n\r\nThe earliest notices of the division of the Decalogue, are those of\r\nJosephus, lib. iii. c. 5. s. 5.; Philo-Judaeus _de Decem Oraculis_; and the\r\nChaldaic Paraphrase of Jonathan. According to these, the third verse of\r\nExod. xx. contains the first commandment; the fourth, fifth, and sixth, the\r\nsecond. The same distinction was adopted by the following early\r\nwriters:--Origen (_Homil. viii. in Exod._), Greg. Nazienzen (_Carmina Mosis\r\nDecalogus_), Irenaeus (lib. iii. c. 42.), Athanasius (_in Synopsi S.\r\nScripturae_), Ambrose (_in Ep. ad Ephes. c. vi._).\r\n\r\nIt was first abandoned by Augustine, who was instigated to introduce this\r\ninnovation by the unwarranted representation of the doctrine of the Trinity\r\nby the First Tablet containing three commandments. The schoolmen followed\r\nhis example, and accommodated the words of God to the legislative\r\nrequirements of their new divinity, progressive development, which\r\nterminated in the Church of Rome, in compelling them to command what He\r\nstrictly prohibits (See Ussher's _Answer_.)\r\n\r\n    \"Hath God himself any where declared this to be only an explication of\r\n    the first commandment? Have the prophets or Christ and His apostles\r\n    ever done it? How then can any man's conscience be safe in this matter?\r\n    For it is not a trifling controversy whether it be a distinct\r\n    commandment or an explication of the first; but the lawfulness or\r\n    unlawfulness of the worship of images depends very much upon it, for if\r\n    it be only an explication of the first, then, unless one takes images\r\n    to be gods, their worship is lawful, and so the heathens were excused\r\n    in it, who were not such idiots; but if it be a new and distinct\r\n    precept, then the worshipping any image or similitude becomes a\r\n    grievous sin, and exposes men to the wrath of God in that severe manner\r\n    mentioned in the end of it. And it is a great confirmation that this is\r\n    the true meaning of it, because all the primitive writers[20] of the\r\n    Christian Church not only thought it a sin against this commandment,\r\n    but insisted upon the force of it against those heathens who denied\r\n    that they took their images for gods; and, therefore, this is a very\r\n    insufficient account of leaving out the second commandment (that the\r\n    people are in no danger of superstition or idolatry by\r\n    it.).\"--Stillingfleet's _Doctrines of the Church of Rome, 25.

JONES.\r\n\r\nChetham's Library, Manchester.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Thus St. Augustine himself: \"In the first commandment, any\r\nsimilitude of God in the figments of men is forbidden to be worshipped, not\r\nbecause God hath not an image, but because no image of Him ought to be\r\nworshipped, but that which is the same thing that He is, nor yet that for\r\nHim but with Him.\"--See what is further cited from Augustine by Ussher in\r\nhis _Answer_.]\r\n\r\n_Mounds, Munts, Mount_ (Vol. iii., p. 187.).--If R. W. B. will refer to Mr.\r\nLower's paper on the \"Iron Works of the County of Sussex\" in the second\r\nvolume of the _Sussex Archaelogical Collections_, he will find that iron\r\nworks were carried on in the parish of Maresfield in 1724, and probably\r\nmuch later. It is therefore probable that the lands which he mentions have\r\nderived their names from the pit-mounts round the mouths of the pits\r\nthrough which the iron ore was raised to the surface. In Staffordshire and\r\nShropshire the term _munt_ is used to denote fire-clay of an inferior kind,\r\nwhich makes a large part of every coal-pit mount in those counties. If the\r\nsame kind of fire-clay was found in the iron mines of Sussex, it is not\r\nnecessary to suggest the derivation of the word _munt_.\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of suggesting to MR. ALBERT WAY that the utensil\r\nfigured in page 179. of the above-mentioned work is not an ancient\r\nmustard-mill, but the upper part of an iron mould in which cannon-shot were\r\ncast. The iron tongs, of which a drawing is given in page 179., were\r\nprobably useful for the purpose of drawing along a floor recently cast shot\r\nwhile they were too hot to be handled.\r\n\r\nV. X. Y.\r\n\r\n_San Graal_ (Vol. iii., pp 224. 281.).--Roquefort's article of nine columns\r\nin his _Glos. de la L. Rom._, is decisive of the word being derived from\r\n_Sancta Cratera;_ of _Graal, Greal_, always having meant a vessel or dish\r\nand of all the old romancers having understood the expression in the same\r\nmeaning, namely, _Sancta Cratera, le Saint Graal, the Holy Cup or Vessel_,\r\nbecause, according to the legend, Christ used it at the Paschal Supper; and\r\nJoseph of Arimathea afterwards employed it to catch the blood flowing from\r\nhis wounds. Many cities formerly claimed the honour of possessing this\r\nfabulous relic. Of course, as Price shows, it was an old Oriental\r\nmagic-dish legend, imitated in the West.\r\n\r\nGEORGE STEPHENS.\r\n\r\nStockholm.\r\n\r\n_Epitaph on the Countess of Pembroke_ (Vol. iii., pp 262. 307.).--It has\r\nbeen asserted that the second part of this epitaph was written by Lady\r\nPembroke's son; among whose poems, which were published in 1660, the whole\r\npiece was included. (Park's _Walpole_, ii. 203. _note_; Gifford's _Ben\r\nJonson_, viii. 337.) But it is notorious, that no confidence whatever can\r\nbe placed in that volume (see this shown in detail in Mr. Hannah's edit. of\r\nPoems by Wotton and Raleigh, pp. 61. 63.); nor have we any right to\r\ndistribute the two parts between different authors. There are at least\r\n_four_ {414} old copies of the whole; two in MSS. which are referred to by\r\nMr. Hannah; the one in Pembroke's _Poems_; and the one in that Lansdowne\r\nMS., where it is ascribed to William Browne. Brydges assigned it to Browne,\r\nwhen he published his _Original Poems_ from that MS. at the Lee Priory\r\nPress in 1815, p. 5. Upon the whole, there seems to be more direct evidence\r\nfor Browne than any other person.\r\n\r\nR.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nNOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.\r\n\r\n_A History of the Articles of Religion: to which is added a Series of\r\nDocuments from_ A.D. _1536 to_ A.D. _1615; together with Illustrations from\r\nContemporary Sources_, by Charles Hardwick, M.A., is the title of an octavo\r\nvolume, in which the author seeks to supply a want long felt, especially by\r\nstudents for Holy Orders; namely, a work which should show not the\r\n_doctrine_ but the _history_ of the Articles. For, as he well observes,\r\nwhile many have enriched our literature by expositions of the _doctrine_ of\r\nthe Articles, \"no regular attempt has been made to illustrate the framing\r\nof the Formulary itself, either by viewing it in connection with the\r\nkindred publications of an earlier and a later date, or still more in its\r\nrelation to the period out of which it originally grew.\" This attempt Mr.\r\nHardwick has now made very successfully; and it is because his book is\r\nhistorical and not polemical, that we feel called upon to notice it, and to\r\nbear our testimony to its interest, and its value to that \"large class of\r\nreaders who, anxious to be accurately informed upon the subject, are\r\nprecluded from consulting the voluminous collectors, such as Strype, Le\r\nPlat, or Wilkins.\" Such readers will find Mr. Hardwick's volume a most\r\nvaluable handbook.\r\n\r\nA practical illustration that \"union is strength,\" is shown by a volume\r\nwhich has just reached us, entitled, _Reports and Papers read at the\r\nMeetings of the Architectural Societies of the Archdeaconry of Northampton,\r\nthe Counties of York and Lincoln, and of the Architectural and\r\nArchaeological Societies of Bedfordshire and St. Alban's during the Year\r\n_MDCCCL. _Presented gratuitously to the Members._ Had each of these\r\nSocieties, instead of joining with its fellows, put forth a separate\r\nReport, the probability is, it would not only have involved such Society in\r\nan expense far beyond what it would be justified in incurring, but the\r\nReport itself would not have excited half the interest which will now be\r\ncreated by a comparison of its papers with those of its associate\r\nSocieties; while, with the reduced expense, the benefit of a larger\r\ncirculation is secured. The volume is one highly creditable to the\r\nSocieties, and to the authors of the various communications which are to be\r\nfound in it.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Puttick and Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will be engaged on Monday and\r\ntwo following days in the Sale of a Library rich in works on every branch\r\nof what is now known as Folk Lore and Popular Antiquities, and which may\r\ncertainly, and with great propriety, be styled \"a very curious collection.\"\r\nThe mere enumeration of the various subjects on the title-page of the\r\nCatalogue, ranging, as they do, from Mesmerism and Magic, to Celestial\r\nInfluences, Phrenology, Physiognomy, &c., might serve for the Table of\r\nContents to a History of Human Weakness.\r\n\r\nBOOKS RECEIVED.--_Neander's History of the Planting and Training of the\r\nChristian Church by the Apostles, translated from the third edition of the\r\noriginal German by J.
