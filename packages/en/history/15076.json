There seems\r\nindeed to be something essentially antagonistic between the habit of mind\r\nthat seeks theoretical guidance and that which makes for the successful\r\nconduct of war. The conduct of war is so much a question of personality, of\r\ncharacter, of common-sense, of rapid decision upon complex and\r\never-shifting factors, and those factors themselves are so varied, so\r\nintangible, so dependent upon unstable moral and physical conditions, that\r\nit seems incapable of being reduced to anything like true scientific\r\nanalysis. At the bare idea of a theory or \"science\" of war the mind recurs\r\nuneasily to well-known cases where highly \"scientific\" officers failed as\r\nleaders. Yet, on the other hand, no one will deny that since the great\r\ntheorists of the early nineteenth century attempted to produce a reasoned\r\ntheory of war, its planning and conduct have acquired a method, a\r\nprecision, and a certainty of grasp which were unknown before. Still less\r\nwill any one deny the value which the shrewdest and most successful leaders\r\nin war have placed upon the work of the classical strategical writers.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the mistrust of theory arises from a misconception of\r\nwhat it is that theory claims to do. It does not pretend to give the power\r\nof conduct in the field; it claims no more than to increase the effective\r\npower of conduct. Its main practical value is that it can assist a capable\r\nman to acquire a broad outlook whereby he may be the surer his plan shall\r\ncover all the ground, and whereby he may with greater rapidity and\r\ncertainty seize all the factors of a sudden situation. The greatest of the\r\ntheorists himself puts the matter quite frankly. Of theoretical study he\r\nsays, \"It should educate the mind of the man who is to lead in war, or\r\nrather guide him to self-education, but it should not accompany him on the\r\nfield of battle.\"\r\n\r\nIts practical utility, however, is not by any means confined to its effects\r\nupon the powers of a leader. It is not enough that a leader should have the\r\nability to decide rightly; his subordinates must seize at once the full\r\nmeaning of his decision and be able to express it with certainty in\r\nwell-adjusted action. For this every man concerned must have been trained\r\nto think in the same plane; the chief's order must awake in every brain the\r\nsame process of thought; his words must have the same meaning for all. If a\r\ntheory of tactics had existed in 1780, and if Captain Carkett had had a\r\nsound training in such a theory, he could not possibly have misunderstood\r\nRodney's signal. As it was, the real intention of the signal was obscure,\r\nand Rodney's neglect to explain the tactical device it indicated robbed his\r\ncountry of a victory at an hour of the direst need. There had been no\r\nprevious theoretical training to supply the omission, and Rodney's fine\r\nconception was unintelligible to anybody but himself.\r\n\r\nNor is it only for the sake of mental solidarity between a chief and his\r\nsubordinates that theory is indispensable. It is of still higher value for\r\nproducing a similar solidarity between him and his superiors at the Council\r\ntable at home. How often have officers dumbly acquiesced in ill-advised\r\noperations simply for lack of the mental power and verbal apparatus to\r\nconvince an impatient Minister where the errors of his plan lay? How often,\r\nmoreover, have statesmen and officers, even in the most harmonious\r\nconference, been unable to decide on a coherent plan of war from inability\r\nto analyse scientifically the situation they had to face, and to recognise\r\nthe general character of the struggle in which they were about to engage.\r\nThat the true nature of a war should be realised by contemporaries as\r\nclearly as it comes to be seen afterwards in the fuller light of history is\r\nseldom to be expected. At close range accidental factors will force\r\nthemselves into undue prominence and tend to obscure the true horizon. Such\r\nerror can scarcely ever be eliminated, but by theoretical study we can\r\nreduce it, nor by any other means can we hope to approach the clearness of\r\nvision with which posterity will read our mistakes. Theory is, in fact, a\r\nquestion of education and deliberation, and not of execution at all. That\r\ndepends on the combination of intangible human qualities which we call\r\nexecutive ability.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is all the great authorities ever claimed for theory, but to\r\nthis claim the chief of them at least, after years of active service on the\r\nStaff, attached the highest importance. \"In actual operations,\" he wrote in\r\none of his latest memoranda, \"men are guided solely by their judgment, and\r\nit will hit the mark more or less accurately according as they possess more\r\nor less genius. This is the way all great generals have acted.... Thus it\r\nwill always be in action, and so far judgment will suffice. But when it is\r\na question not of taking action yourself, but of convincing others at the\r\nCouncil table, then everything depends on clear conceptions and the\r\nexposition of the inherent relations of things. So little progress has been\r\nmade in this respect that most deliberations are merely verbal contentions\r\nwhich rest on no firm foundation, and end either in every one retaining his\r\nown opinion, or in a compromise from considerations of mutual respect--a\r\nmiddle course of no actual value.\"[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] Clausewitz, _On War_, p. ix. The references are to Colonel Graham's\r\n  translation of the third German edition, but his wording is not always\r\n  followed exactly.\r\n\r\nThe writer's experience of such discussions was rich and at first hand.\r\nClear conceptions of the ideas and factors involved in a war problem, and a\r\ndefinite exposition of the relations between them, were in his eyes the\r\nremedy for loose and purposeless discussion; and such conceptions and\r\nexpositions are all we mean by the theory or the science of war. It is a\r\nprocess by which we co-ordinate our ideas, define the meaning of the words\r\nwe use, grasp the difference between essential and unessential factors, and\r\nfix and expose the fundamental data on which every one is agreed. In this\r\nway we prepare the apparatus of practical discussion; we secure the means\r\nof arranging the factors in manageable shape, and of deducing from them\r\nwith precision and rapidity a practical course of action. Without such an\r\napparatus no two men can even think on the same line; much less can they\r\never hope to detach the real point of difference that divides them and\r\nisolate it for quiet solution.\r\n\r\nIn our own case this view of the value of strategical theory has a special\r\nsignificance, and one far wider than its continental enunciators\r\ncontemplated. For a world-wide maritime Empire the successful conduct of\r\nwar will often turn not only on the decisions of the Council chamber at\r\nhome, but on the outcome of conferences in all parts of the world between\r\nsquadronal commanders and the local authorities, both civil and military,\r\nand even between commanders-in-chief of adjacent stations. In time of war\r\nor of preparation for war, in which the Empire is concerned, arrangements\r\nmust always be based to an exceptional degree on the mutual relation of\r\nnaval, military, and political considerations. The line of mean efficiency,\r\nthough indicated from home, must be worked out locally, and worked out on\r\nfactors of which no one service is master. Conference is always necessary,\r\nand for conference to succeed there must be a common vehicle of expression\r\nand a common plane of thought. It is for this essential preparation that\r\ntheoretical study alone can provide; and herein lies its practical value\r\nfor all who aspire to the higher responsibilities of the Imperial service.\r\n\r\nSo great indeed is the value of abstract strategical study from this point\r\nof view, that it is necessary to guard ourselves against over-valuation. So\r\nfar from claiming for their so-called science more than the possibilities\r\nwe have indicated, the classical strategists insist again and again on the\r\ndanger of seeking from it what it cannot give. They even repudiate the very\r\nname of \"Science.\" They prefer the older term \"Art.\" They will permit no\r\nlaws or rules. Such laws, they say, can only mislead in practice, for the\r\nfriction to which they are subject from the incalculable human factors\r\nalone is such that the friction is stronger than the law. It is an old\r\nadage of lawyers that nothing is so misleading as a legal maxim, but a\r\nstrategical maxim is undoubtedly and in every way less to be trusted in\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWhat then, it will be asked, are the tangible results which we can hope to\r\nattain from theory? If all on which we have to build is so indeterminate,\r\nhow are any practical conclusions to be reached? That the factors are\r\ninfinitely varied and difficult to determine is true, but that, it must be\r\nremembered, is just what emphasises the necessity of reaching such firm\r\nstandpoints as are attainable. The vaguer the problem to be solved, the\r\nmore resolute must we be in seeking points of departure from which we can\r\nbegin to lay a course, keeping always an eye open for the accidents that\r\nwill beset us, and being always alive to their deflecting influences. And\r\nthis is just what the theoretical study of strategy can do. It can at least\r\ndetermine the normal. By careful collation of past events it becomes clear\r\nthat certain lines of conduct tend normally to produce certain effects;\r\nthat wars tend to take certain forms each with a marked idiosyncrasy; that\r\nthese forms are normally related to the object of the war and to its value\r\nto one or both belligerents; that a system of operations which suits one\r\nform may not be that best suited to another. We can even go further. By\r\npursuing an historical and comparative method we can detect that even the\r\nhuman factor is not quite indeterminable. We can assert that certain\r\nsituations will normally produce, whether in ourselves or in our\r\nadversaries, certain moral states on which we may calculate.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the normal, we are at once in a stronger position. Any\r\nproposal can be compared with it, and we can proceed to discuss clearly the\r\nweight of the factors which prompt us to depart from the normal. Every case\r\nmust be judged on its merits, but without a normal to work from we cannot\r\nform any real judgment at all; we can only guess. Every case will assuredly\r\ndepart from the normal to a greater or less extent, and it is equally\r\ncertain that the greatest successes in war have been the boldest departures\r\nfrom the normal. But for the most part they have been departures made with\r\nopen eyes by geniuses who could perceive in the accidents of the case a\r\njust reason for the departure.\r\n\r\nTake an analogous example, and the province of strategical theory becomes\r\nclear at once. Navigation and the parts of seamanship that belong to it\r\nhave to deal with phenomena as varied and unreliable as those of the\r\nconduct of war. Together they form an art which depends quite as much as\r\ngeneralship on the judgment of individuals. The law of storms and tides, of\r\nwinds and currents, and the whole of meteorology are subject to infinite\r\nand incalculable deflections, and yet who will deny nowadays that by the\r\ntheoretical study of such things the seaman's art has gained in coherence\r\nand strength? Such study will not by itself make a seaman or a navigator,\r\nbut without it no seaman or navigator can nowadays pretend to the name.\r\nBecause storms do not always behave in the same way, because currents are\r\nerratic, will the most practical seaman deny that the study of the normal\r\nconditions are useless to him in his practical decisions?\r\n\r\nIf, then, the theoretical study of strategy be approached in this way--if,\r\nthat is, it be regarded not as a substitute for judgment and experience,\r\nbut as a means of fertilising both, it can do no man harm. Individual\r\nthought and common-sense will remain the masters and remain the guides to\r\npoint the general direction when the mass of facts begins to grow\r\nbewildering. Theory will warn us the moment we begin to leave the beaten\r\ntrack, and enable us to decide with open eyes whether the divergence is\r\nnecessary or justifiable. Above all, when men assemble in Council it will\r\nhold discussion to the essential lines, and help to keep side issues in\r\ntheir place.\r\n\r\nBut beyond all this there lies in the theory of war yet another element of\r\npeculiar value to a maritime Empire. We are accustomed, partly for\r\nconvenience and partly from lack of a scientific habit of thought, to speak\r\nof naval strategy and military strategy as though they were distinct\r\nbranches of knowledge which had no common ground. It is the theory of war\r\nwhich brings out their intimate relation. It reveals that embracing them\r\nboth is a larger strategy which regards the fleet and army as one weapon,\r\nwhich co-ordinates their action, and indicates the lines on which each must\r\nmove to realise the full power of both. It will direct us to assign to each\r\nits proper function in a plan of war; it will enable each service to\r\nrealise the better the limitations and the possibilities of the function\r\nwith which it is charged, and how and when its own necessities must give\r\nway to a higher or more pressing need of the other. It discloses, in short,\r\nthat naval strategy is not a thing by itself, that its problems can seldom\r\nor never be solved on naval considerations alone, but that it is only a\r\npart of maritime strategy--the higher learning which teaches us that for a\r\nmaritime State to make successful war and to realise her special strength,\r\narmy and navy must be used and thought of as instruments no less intimately\r\nconnected than are the three arms ashore.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that it is of little use to approach naval strategy\r\nexcept through the theory of war. Without such theory we can never really\r\nunderstand its scope or meaning, nor can we hope to grasp the forces which\r\nmost profoundly affect its conclusions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    PART ONE\r\n\r\n                  THEORY OF WAR\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   CHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n                THE THEORY OF WAR\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last thing that an explorer arrives at is a complete map that will\r\ncover the whole ground he has travelled, but for those who come after him\r\nand would profit by and extend his knowledge his map is the first thing\r\nwith which they will begin. So it is with strategy. Before we start upon\r\nits study we seek a chart which will show us at a glance what exactly is\r\nthe ground we have to cover and what are the leading features which\r\ndetermine its form and general characteristics. Such a chart a \"theory of\r\nwar\" alone can provide. It is for this reason that in the study of war we\r\nmust get our theory clear before we can venture in search of practical\r\nconclusions. So great is the complexity of war that without such a guide we\r\nare sure to go astray amidst the bewildering multiplicity of tracks and\r\nobstacles that meet us at every step. If for continental strategy its value\r\nhas been proved abundantly, then for maritime strategy, where the\r\nconditions are far more complex, the need of it is even greater.\r\n\r\nBy maritime strategy we mean the principles which govern a war in which the\r\nsea is a substantial factor. Naval strategy is but that part of it which\r\ndetermines the movements of the fleet when maritime strategy has determined\r\nwhat part the fleet must play in relation to the action of the land forces;\r\nfor it scarcely needs saying that it is almost impossible that a war can be\r\ndecided by naval action alone. Unaided, naval pressure can only work by a\r\nprocess of exhaustion. Its effects must always be slow, and so galling both\r\nto our own commercial community and to neutrals, that the tendency is\r\nalways to accept terms of peace that are far from conclusive. For a firm\r\ndecision a quicker and more drastic form of pressure is required. Since men\r\nlive upon the land and not upon the sea, great issues between nations at\r\nwar have always been decided--except in the rarest cases--either by what\r\nyour army can do against your enemy's territory and national life or else\r\nby the fear of what the fleet makes it possible for your army to do.\r\n\r\nThe paramount concern, then, of maritime strategy is to determine the\r\nmutual relations of your army and navy in a plan of war. When this is done,\r\nand not till then, naval strategy can begin to work out the manner in which\r\nthe fleet can best discharge the function assigned to it.\r\n\r\nThe problem of such co-ordination is one that is susceptible of widely\r\nvarying solutions. It may be that the command of the sea is of so urgent an\r\nimportance that the army will have to devote itself to assisting the fleet\r\nin its special task before it can act directly against the enemy's\r\nterritory and land forces; on the other hand, it may be that the immediate\r\nduty of the fleet will be to forward military action ashore before it is\r\nfree to devote itself whole-heartedly to the destruction of the enemy's\r\nfleets. The crude maxims as to primary objects which seem to have served\r\nwell enough in continental warfare have never worked so clearly where the\r\nsea enters seriously into a war. In such cases it will not suffice to say\r\nthe primary object of the army is to destroy the enemy's army, or that of\r\nthe fleet to destroy the enemy's fleet. The delicate interactions of the\r\nland and sea factors produce conditions too intricate for such blunt\r\nsolutions. Even the initial equations they present are too complex to be\r\nreduced by the simple application of rough-and-ready maxims. Their right\r\nhandling depends upon the broadest and most fundamental principles of war,\r\nand it is as a standpoint from which to get a clear and unobstructed view\r\nof the factors in their true relations that a theory of war has perhaps its\r\nhighest value.\r\n\r\nThe theory which now holds the field is that war in a fundamental sense is\r\na continuation of policy by other means. The process by which the\r\ncontinental strategists arrived at it involved some hard philosophical\r\nreasoning. Practical and experienced veterans as they were, their method is\r\nnot one that works easily with our own habit of thought. It will be well,\r\ntherefore, to endeavour first to present their conclusions in a concrete\r\nform, which will make the pith of the matter intelligible at once. Take,\r\nnow, the ordinary case of a naval or military Staff being asked to prepare\r\na war plan against a certain State and to advise what means it will\r\nrequire. To any one who has considered such matters it is obvious the reply\r\nmust be another question--What will the war be about? Without a definite\r\nanswer or alternative answers to that question a Staff can scarcely do more\r\nthan engage in making such forces as the country can afford as efficient as\r\npossible. Before they take any sure step further they must know many\r\nthings. They must know whether they are expected to take something from the\r\nenemy, or to prevent his taking something either from us or from some other\r\nState. If from some other State, the measures to be taken will depend on\r\nits geographical situation and on its relative strength by land and sea.\r\nEven when the object is clear it will be necessary to know how much value\r\nthe enemy attaches to it. Is it one for which he will be likely to fight to\r\nthe death, or one which he will abandon in the face of comparatively slight\r\nresistance? If the former, we cannot hope to succeed without entirely\r\noverthrowing his powers of resistance. If the latter, it will suffice, as\r\nit often has sufficed, to aim at something less costly and hazardous and\r\nbetter within our means. All these are questions which lie in the lap of\r\nMinisters charged with the foreign policy of the country, and before the\r\nStaff can proceed with a war plan they must be answered by Ministers.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Staff must ask of them what is the policy which your\r\ndiplomacy is pursuing, and where, and why, do you expect it to break down\r\nand force you to take up arms? The Staff has to carry on in fact when\r\ndiplomacy has failed to achieve the object in view, and the method they\r\nwill use will depend on the nature of that object. So we arrive crudely at\r\nour theory that war is a continuation of policy, a form of political\r\nintercourse in which we fight battles instead of writing notes.\r\n\r\nIt was this theory, simple and even meaningless as it appears at first\r\nsight, that gave the key to the practical work of framing a modern war plan\r\nand revolutionised the study of strategy. It was not till the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century that such a theory was arrived at. For centuries men\r\nhad written on the \"Art of War,\" but for want of a working theory their\r\nlabours as a whole had been unscientific, concerned for the most part with\r\nthe discussion of passing fashions and the elaboration of platitudes. Much\r\ngood work it is true was done on details, but no broad outlook had been\r\nobtained to enable us to determine their relation to the fundamental\r\nconstants of the subject. No standpoint had been found from which we could\r\nreadily detach such constants from what was merely accidental. The result\r\nwas a tendency to argue too exclusively from the latest examples and to\r\nbecome entangled in erroneous thought by trying to apply the methods which\r\nhad attained the last success to war as a whole. There was no means of\r\ndetermining how far the particular success was due to special conditions\r\nand how far it was due to factors common to all wars.\r\n\r\nIt was the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, coinciding as they did with a\r\nperiod of philosophic activity, that revealed the shallowness and empirical\r\nnature of all that had been done up to that time. Napoleon's methods\r\nappeared to his contemporaries to have produced so strenuous a revolution\r\nin the conduct of land warfare that it assumed a wholly new aspect, and it\r\nwas obvious that those conceptions which had sufficed previously had become\r\ninadequate as a basis of sound study. War on land seemed to have changed\r\nfrom a calculated affair of thrust and parry between standing armies to a\r\nheadlong rush of one nation in arms upon another, each thirsting for the\r\nother's life, and resolved to have it or perish in the attempt. Men felt\r\nthemselves faced with a manifestation of human energy which had had no\r\ncounterpart, at least in civilised times.\r\n\r\nThe assumption was not entirely true. For although the Continent had never\r\nbefore adopted the methods in question, our own country was no stranger to\r\nthem either on sea or land. As we shall see, our own Revolution in the\r\nseventeenth century had produced strenuous methods of making war which were\r\nclosely related to those which Napoleon took over from the French\r\nRevolutionary leaders. A more philosophic outlook might have suggested that\r\nthe phenomenon was not really exceptional, but rather the natural outcome\r\nof popular energy inspired by a stirring political ideal. But the British\r\nprecedent was forgotten, and so profound was the disturbance caused by the\r\nnew French methods that its effects are with us still. We are in fact still\r\ndominated by the idea that since the Napoleonic era war has been\r\nessentially a different thing. Our teachers incline to insist that there is\r\nnow only one way of making war, and that is Napoleon's way. Ignoring the\r\nfact that he failed in the end, they brand as heresy the bare suggestion\r\nthat there may be other ways, and not content with assuming that his system\r\nwill fit all land wars, however much their natures and objects may differ,\r\nthey would force naval warfare into the same uniform under the impression\r\napparently that they are thereby making it presentable and giving it some\r\nnew force.\r\n\r\nSeeing how cramping the Napoleonic idea has become, it will be convenient\r\nbefore going further to determine its special characteristics exactly, but\r\nthat is no easy matter. The moment we approach it in a critical spirit, it\r\nbegins to grow nebulous and very difficult to define. We can dimly make out\r\nfour distinct ideas mingled in the current notion. First, there is the idea\r\nof making war not merely with a professional standing army, but with the\r\nwhole armed nation--a conception which of course was not really Napoleon's.\r\nIt was inherited by him from the Revolution, but was in fact far older. It\r\nwas but a revival of the universal practice which obtained in the barbaric\r\nstages of social development, and which every civilisation in turn had\r\nabandoned as economically unsound and subversive of specialisation in\r\ncitizenship. The results of the abandonment were sometimes good and\r\nsometimes bad, but the determining conditions have been studied as yet too\r\nimperfectly to justify any broad generalisation. Secondly, there is the\r\nidea of strenuous and persistent effort--not resting to secure each minor\r\nadvantage, but pressing the enemy without pause or rest till he is utterly\r\noverthrown--an idea in which Cromwell had anticipated Napoleon by a century\r\nand a half. Scarcely distinguishable from this is a third idea--that of\r\ntaking the offensive, in which there was really nothing new at all, since\r\nits advantages had always been understood, and Frederick the Great had\r\npressed it to extremity with little less daring than Napoleon himself--nay\r\neven to culpable rashness, as the highest exponents of the Napoleonic idea\r\nadmit. Finally, there is the notion of making the armed forces of the enemy\r\nand not his territory or any part of it your main objective. This perhaps\r\nis regarded as the strongest characteristic of Napoleon's methods, and yet\r\neven here we are confused by the fact that undoubtedly on some very\r\nimportant occasions--the Austerlitz campaign, for example--Napoleon made\r\nthe hostile capital his objective as though he believed its occupation was\r\nthe most effective step towards the overthrow of the enemy's power and will\r\nto resist. He certainly did not make the enemy's main army his primary\r\nobjective--for their main army was not Mack's but that of the Archduke\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\nOn the whole then, when men speak of the Napoleonic system they seem to\r\ninclude two groups of ideas--one which comprises the conception of war made\r\nwith the whole force of the nation; the other, a group which includes the\r\nCromwellian idea of persistent effort, Frederick's preference for the\r\noffensive at almost any risk, and finally the idea of the enemy's armed\r\nforces as the main objective, which was also Cromwell's.\r\n\r\nIt is the combination of these by no means original or very distinct ideas\r\nthat we are told has brought about so entire a change in the conduct of war\r\nthat it has become altogether a different thing. It is unnecessary for our\r\npurpose to consider how far the facts seem to support such a conclusion,\r\nfor in the inherent nature of things it must be radically unsound. Neither\r\nwar nor anything else can change in its essentials. If it appears to do so,\r\nit is because we are still mistaking accidents for essentials, and this is\r\nexactly how it struck the acutest thinkers of Napoleonic times.\r\n\r\nFor a while it is true they were bewildered, but so soon as they had had\r\ntime to clear their heads from the din of the struggle in which they had\r\ntaken part, they began to see that the new phenomena were but accidents\r\nafter all. They perceived that Napoleon's methods, which had taken the\r\nworld by storm, had met with success in wars of a certain nature only, and\r\nthat when he tried to extend those methods to other natures of war he had\r\nmet with failure and even disaster. How was this to be explained? What\r\ntheory, for instance, would cover Napoleon's successes in Germany and\r\nItaly, as well as his failures in Spain and Russia? If the whole conception\r\nof war had changed, how could you account for the success of England, who\r\nhad not changed her methods? To us the answer to these questions is of\r\nliving and infinite importance. Our standpoint remains still unchanged. Is\r\nthere anything inherent in the conception of war that justifies that\r\nattitude in our case? Are we entitled to expect from it again the same\r\nsuccess it met with in the past?\r\n\r\nThe first man to enunciate a theory which would explain the phenomena of\r\nthe Napoleonic era and co-ordinate them with previous history was General\r\nCarl von Clausewitz, a man whose arduous service on the Staff and the\r\nactual work of higher instruction had taught the necessity of systematising\r\nthe study of his profession. He was no mere professor, but a soldier bred\r\nin the severest school of war. The pupil and friend of Sharnhorst and\r\nGneisenau, he had served on the Staff of Blücher in 1813, he had been Chief\r\nof the Staff to Wallmoden in his campaign against Davoust on the Lower\r\nElbe, and also to the Third Prussian Army Corps in the campaign of 1815.\r\nThereafter for more than ten years he was Director of the General Academy\r\nof War at Berlin, and died in 1831 as Chief of the Staff to Marshal\r\nGneisenau. For the fifty years that followed his death his theories and\r\nsystem were, as he expected they would be, attacked from all sides. Yet\r\nto-day his work is more firmly established than ever as the necessary basis\r\nof all strategical thought, and above all in the \"blood and iron\" school of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe process by which he reached his famous theory can be followed in his\r\nclassical work _On War_ and the _Notes_ regarding it which he left behind\r\nhim. In accordance with the philosophic fashion of his time he began by\r\ntrying to formulate an abstract idea of war. The definition he started with\r\nwas that \"War is an act of violence to compel our opponent to do our will.\"\r\nBut that act of violence was not merely \"the shock of armies,\" as\r\nMontecuccoli had defined it a century and a half before. If the abstract\r\nidea of war be followed to its logical conclusion, the act of violence must\r\nbe performed with the whole of the means at our disposal and with the\r\nutmost exertion of our will. Consequently we get the conception of two\r\narmed nations flinging themselves one upon the other, and continuing the\r\nstruggle with the utmost strength and energy they can command till one or\r\nother is no longer capable of resistance. This Clausewitz called \"Absolute\r\nWar.\" But his practical experience and ripe study of history told him at\r\nonce that \"Real War\" was something radically different. It was true, as he\r\nsaid, that Napoleon's methods had approximated to the absolute and had\r\ngiven some colour to the use of the absolute idea as a working theory. \"But\r\nshall we,\" he acutely asks, \"rest satisfied with this idea and judge all\r\nwars by it however much they may differ from it--shall we deduce from it\r\nall the requirements of theory? We must decide the point, for we can say\r\nnothing trustworthy about a war plan until we have made up our minds\r\nwhether war should only be of this kind or whether it may be of another\r\nkind.\" He saw at once that a theory formed upon the abstract or absolute\r\nidea of war would not cover the ground, and therefore failed to give what\r\nwas required for practical purposes. It would exclude almost the whole of\r\nwar from Alexander's time to Napoleon's. And what guarantee was there that\r\nthe next war would confirm to the Napoleonic type and accommodate itself to\r\nthe abstract theory? \"This theory,\" he says, \"is still quite powerless\r\nagainst the force of circumstances.\" And so it proved, for the wars of the\r\nmiddle nineteenth century did in fact revert to the pre-Napoleonic type.\r\n\r\nIn short, Clausewitz's difficulty in adopting his abstract theory as a\r\nworking rule was that his practical mind could not forget that war had not\r\nbegun with the Revolutionary era, nor was it likely to end with it. If that\r\nera had changed the conduct of war, it must be presumed that war would\r\nchange again with other times and other conditions. A theory of war which\r\ndid not allow for this and did not cover all that had gone before was no\r\ntheory at all. If a theory of war was to be of any use as a practical guide\r\nit must cover and explain not only the extreme manifestation of hostility\r\nwhich he himself had witnessed, but every manifestation that had occurred\r\nin the past or was likely to recur in the future.\r\n\r\nIt was in casting about for the underlying causes of the oscillations\r\nmanifested in the energy and intensity of hostile relations that he found\r\nhis solution. His experience on the Staff, and his study of the inner\r\nsprings of war, told him it was never in fact a question of purely military\r\nendeavour aiming always at the extreme of what was possible or expedient\r\nfrom a purely military point of view. The energy exhibited would always be\r\nmodified by political considerations and by the depth of the national\r\ninterest in the object of the war. He saw that real war was in fact an\r\ninternational relation which differed from other international relations\r\nonly in the method we adopted to achieve the object of our policy. So it\r\nwas he arrived at his famous theory--\"that war is a mere continuation of\r\npolicy by other means.\"\r\n\r\nAt first sight there seems little enough in it. It may seem perhaps that we\r\nhave been watching a mountain in labour and nothing but a mouse has been\r\nproduced. But it is only upon some such simple, even obvious, formula that\r\nany scientific system can be constructed with safety. We have only to\r\ndevelop the meaning of this one to see how important and practical are the\r\nguiding lines which flow from it.\r\n\r\nWith the conception of war as a continuation of political intercourse\r\nbefore us, it is clear that everything which lies outside the political\r\nconception, everything, that is, which is strictly peculiar to military and\r\nnaval operations, relates merely to the means which we use to achieve our\r\npolicy. Consequently, the first desideratum of a war plan is that the means\r\nadopted must conflict as little as possible with the political conditions\r\nfrom which the war springs. In practice, of course, as in all human\r\nrelations, there will be a compromise between the means and the end,\r\nbetween the political and the military exigencies. But Clausewitz held that\r\npolicy must always be the master. The officer charged with the conduct of\r\nthe war may of course demand that the tendencies and views of policy shall\r\nnot be incompatible with the military means which are placed at his\r\ndisposal; but however strongly this demand may react on policy in\r\nparticular cases, military action must still be regarded only as a\r\nmanifestation of policy. It must never supersede policy. The policy is\r\nalways the object; war is only the means by which we obtain the object, and\r\nthe means must always keep the end in view.\r\n\r\nThe practical importance of this conception will now become clear. It will\r\nbe seen to afford the logical or theoretical exposition of what we began by\r\nstating in its purely concrete form. When a Chief of Staff is asked for a\r\nwar plan he must not say we will make war in such and such a way because it\r\nwas Napoleon's or Moltke's way. He will ask what is the political object of\r\nthe war, what are the political conditions, and how much does the question\r\nat issue mean respectively to us and to our adversary. It is these\r\nconsiderations which determine the nature of the war. This primordial\r\nquestion settled, he will be in a position to say whether the war is of the\r\nsame nature as those in which Napoleon's and Moltke's methods were\r\nsuccessful, or whether it is of another nature in which those methods\r\nfailed. He will then design and offer a war plan, not because it has the\r\nhall-mark of this or that great master of war, but because it is one that\r\nhas been proved to fit the kind of war in hand. To assume that one method\r\nof conducting war will suit all kinds of war is to fall a victim to\r\nabstract theory, and not to be a prophet of reality, as the narrowest\r\ndisciples of the Napoleonic school are inclined to see themselves.\r\n\r\nHence, says Clausewitz, the first, the greatest and most critical decision\r\nupon which the Statesman and the General have to exercise their judgment is\r\nto determine the nature of the war, to be sure they do not mistake it for\r\nsomething nor seek to make of it something which from its inherent\r\nconditions it can never be. \"This,\" he declares, \"is the first and the most\r\nfar-reaching of all strategical questions.\"\r\n\r\nThe first value, then, of his theory of war is that it gives a clear line\r\non which we may proceed to determine the nature of a war in which we are\r\nabout to engage, and to ensure that we do not try to apply to one nature of\r\nwar any particular course of operations simply because they have proved\r\nsuccessful in another nature of war. It is only, he insists, by regarding\r\nwar not as an independent thing but as a political instrument that we can\r\nread aright the lessons of history and understand for our practical\r\nguidance how wars must differ in character according to the nature of the\r\nmotives and circumstances from which they proceed. This conception, he\r\nclaims, is the first ray of light to guide us to a true theory of war and\r\nthereby enable us to classify wars and distinguish them one from another.\r\n\r\nJomini, his great contemporary and rival, though proceeding by a less\r\nphilosophical but no less lucid method, entirely endorses this view. A\r\nSwiss soldier of fortune, his experience was much the same as that of\r\nClausewitz. It was obtained mainly on the Staff of Marshal Ney and\r\nsubsequently on the Russian headquarter Staff. He reached no definite\r\ntheory of war, but his fundamental conclusions were the same. The first\r\nchapter of his final work, _Précis de l'art de la Guerre_, is devoted to\r\n\"La Politique de la Guerre.\" In it he classifies wars into nine categories\r\naccording to their political object, and he lays it down as a base\r\nproposition \"That these different kinds of war will have more or less\r\ninfluence on the nature of the operations which will be demanded to attain\r\nthe end in view, on the amount of energy that must be put forth, and on the\r\nextent of the undertakings in which we must engage.\" \"There will,\" he adds,\r\n\"be a great difference in the operations according to the risks we have to\r\nrun.\"\r\n\r\nBoth men, therefore, though on details of means they were often widely\r\nopposed, are agreed that the fundamental conception of war is political.\r\nBoth of course agree that if we isolate in our mind the forces engaged in\r\nany theatre of war the abstract conception reappears. So far as those\r\nforces are concerned, war is a question of fighting in which each\r\nbelligerent should endeavour by all means at his command and with all his\r\nenergy to destroy the other. But even so they may find that certain means\r\nare barred to them for political reasons, and at any moment the fortune of\r\nwar or a development of the political conditions with which it is entangled\r\nmay throw them back upon the fundamental political theory.\r\n\r\nThat theory it will be unprofitable to labour further at this point. Let it\r\nsuffice for the present to mark that it gives us a conception of war as an\r\nexertion of violence to secure a political end which we desire to attain,\r\nand that from this broad and simple formula we are able to deduce at once\r\nthat wars will vary according to the nature of the end and the intensity of\r\nour desire to attain it. Here we may leave it to gather force and coherence\r\nas we examine the practical considerations which are its immediate outcome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   CHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n                 NATURES OF WARS--\r\n             OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving determined that wars must vary in character according to the nature\r\nand importance of their object, we are faced with the difficulty that the\r\nvariations will be of infinite number and of all degrees of distinction. So\r\ncomplex indeed is the graduation presented that at first sight it appears\r\nscarcely possible to make it the basis of practical study. But on further\r\nexamination it will be seen that by applying the usual analytical method\r\nthe whole subject is susceptible of much simplification. We must in short\r\nattempt to reach some system of classification; that is, we must see if it\r\nis not possible to group the variations into some well-founded categories.\r\nWith a subject so complex and intangible the grouping must of course be to\r\nsome extent arbitrary, and in some places the lines of demarcation will be\r\nshadowy; but if classification has been found possible and helpful in\r\nZoology or Botany, with the infinite and minute individual variations with\r\nwhich they have to deal, it should be no less possible and helpful in the\r\nstudy of war.\r\n\r\nThe political theory of war will at any rate give us two broad and\r\nwell-marked classifications. The first is simple and well known, depending\r\non whether the political object of the war is positive or negative. If it\r\nbe positive--that is, if our aim is to wrest something from the enemy--then\r\nour war in its main lines will be offensive. If, on the other hand, our aim\r\nbe negative, and we simply seek to prevent the enemy wresting some\r\nadvantage to our detriment, then the war in its general direction will be\r\ndefensive.\r\n\r\nIt is only as a broad conception that this classification has value. Though\r\nit fixes the general trend of our operations, it will not in itself affect\r\ntheir character. For a maritime Power at least it is obvious that this must\r\nbe so. For in any circumstances it is impossible for such a Power either to\r\nestablish its defence or develop fully its offence without securing a\r\nworking control of the sea by aggressive action against the enemy's fleets.\r\nFurthermore, we have always found that however strictly our aim may be\r\ndefensive, the most effective means of securing it has been by\r\ncounter-attack over-sea, either to support an ally directly or to deprive\r\nour enemy of his colonial possessions. Neither category, then, excludes the\r\nuse of offensive operations nor the idea of overthrowing our enemy so far\r\nas is necessary to gain our end. In neither case does the conception lead\r\nus eventually to any other objective than the enemy's armed forces, and\r\nparticularly his naval forces. The only real difference is this--that if\r\nour object be positive our general plan must be offensive, and we should at\r\nleast open with a true offensive movement; whereas if our object be\r\nnegative our general plan will be preventive, and we may bide our time for\r\nour counter-attack. To this extent our action must always tend to the\r\noffensive. For counter-attack is the soul of defence. Defence is not a\r\npassive attitude, for that is the negation of war. Rightly conceived, it is\r\nan attitude of alert expectation. We wait for the moment when the enemy\r\nshall expose himself to a counter-stroke, the success of which will so far\r\ncripple him as to render us relatively strong enough to pass to the\r\noffensive ourselves.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it will appear that, real and logical as the\r\nclassification is, to give it the designation \"offensive and defensive\" is\r\nobjectionable from every point of view. To begin with, it does not\r\nemphasise what the real and logical distinction is. It suggests that the\r\nbasis of the classification is not so much a difference of object as a\r\ndifference in the means employed to achieve the object. Consequently we\r\nfind ourselves continually struggling with the false assumption that\r\npositive war means using attack, and negative war being content with\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nThat is confusing enough, but a second objection to the designation is far\r\nmore serious and more fertile of error. For the classification \"offensive\r\nand defensive\" implies that offensive and defensive are mutually exclusive\r\nideas, whereas the truth is, and it is a fundamental truth of war, that\r\nthey are mutually complementary. All war and every form of it must be both\r\noffensive and defensive. No matter how clear our positive aim nor how high\r\nour offensive spirit, we cannot develop an aggressive line of strategy to\r\nthe full without the support of the defensive on all but the main lines of\r\noperation. In tactics it is the same. The most convinced devotee of attack\r\nadmits the spade as well as the rifle. And even when it comes to men and\r\nmaterial, we know that without a certain amount of protection neither\r\nships, guns, nor men can develop their utmost energy and endurance in\r\nstriking power. There is never, in fact, a clean choice between attack and\r\ndefence. In aggressive operations the question always is, how far must\r\ndefence enter into the methods we employ in order to enable us to do the\r\nutmost within our resources to break or paralyse the strength of the enemy.\r\nSo also with defence. Even in its most legitimate use, it must always be\r\nsupplemented by attack. Even behind the walls of a fortress men know that\r\nsooner or later the place must fall unless by counter-attack on the enemy's\r\nsiege works or communications they can cripple his power of attack.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that it were better to lay aside the designation\r\n\"offensive and defensive\" altogether and substitute the terms \"positive and\r\nnegative.\" But here again we are confronted with a difficulty. There have\r\nbeen many wars in which positive methods have been used all through to\r\nsecure a negative end, and such wars will not sit easily in either class.\r\nFor instance, in the War of Spanish Succession our object was mainly to\r\nprevent the Mediterranean becoming a French lake by the union of the French\r\nand Spanish crowns, but the method by which we succeeded in achieving our\r\nend was to seize the naval positions of Gibraltar and Minorca, and so in\r\npractice our method was positive. Again, in the late Russo-Japanese War the\r\nmain object of Japan was to prevent Korea being absorbed by Russia. That\r\naim was preventive and negative. But the only effective way of securing her\r\naim was to take Korea herself, and so for her the war was in practice\r\npositive.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that in the majority\r\nof wars the side with the positive object has acted generally on the\r\noffensive and the other generally on the defensive. Unpractical therefore\r\nas the distinction seems to be, it is impossible to dismiss it without\r\ninquiring why this was so, and it is in this inquiry that the practical\r\nresults of the classification will be found to lie--that is, it forces us\r\nto analyse the comparative advantages of offence and defence. A clear\r\napprehension of their relative possibilities is the corner stone of\r\nstrategical study.\r\n\r\nNow the advantages of the offensive are patent and admitted. It is only the\r\noffensive that can produce positive results, while the strength and energy\r\nwhich are born of the moral stimulation of attack are of a practical value\r\nthat outweighs almost every other consideration. Every man of spirit would\r\ndesire to use the offensive whether his object were positive or negative,\r\nand yet there are a number of cases in which some of the most energetic\r\nmasters of war have chosen the defensive, and chosen with success. They\r\nhave chosen it when they have found themselves inferior in physical force\r\nto their enemy, and when they believed that no amount of aggressive spirit\r\ncould redress that inferiority.\r\n\r\nObviously, then, for all the inferiority of the defensive as a drastic form\r\nof war it must have some inherent advantage which the offensive does not\r\nenjoy. In war we adopt every method for which we have sufficient strength.\r\nIf, then, we adopt the less desirable method of defence, it must be either\r\nthat we have not sufficient strength for offence, or that the defence gives\r\nus some special strength for the attainment of our object.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are these elements of strength? It is very necessary to\r\ninquire, not only that we may know that if for a time we are forced back\r\nupon the defensive all is not lost, but also that we may judge with how\r\nmuch daring we should push our offensive to prevent the enemy securing the\r\nadvantages of defence.\r\n\r\nAs a general principle we all know that possession is nine points of the\r\nlaw. It is easier to keep money in our pocket than to take it from another\r\nman's. If one man would rob another he must be the stronger or better armed\r\nunless he can do it by dexterity or stealth, and there lies one of the\r\nadvantages of offence. The side which takes the initiative has usually the\r\nbetter chance of securing advantage by dexterity or stealth. But it is not\r\nalways so. If either by land or sea we can take a defensive position so\r\ngood that it cannot be turned and must be broken down before our enemy can\r\nreach his objective, then the advantage of dexterity and stealth passes to\r\nus. We choose our own ground for the trial of strength. We are hidden on\r\nfamiliar ground; he is exposed on ground that is less familiar. We can lay\r\ntraps and prepare surprises by counter-attack, when he is most dangerously\r\nexposed. Hence the paradoxical doctrine that where defence is sound and\r\nwell designed the advantage of surprise is against the attack.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen therefore that whatever advantages lie in defence they\r\ndepend on the preservation of the offensive spirit. Its essence is the\r\ncounter-attack--waiting deliberately for a chance to strike--not cowering\r\nin inactivity. Defence is a condition of restrained activity--not a mere\r\ncondition of rest. Its real weakness is that if unduly prolonged it tends\r\nto deaden the spirit of offence. This is a truth so vital that some\r\nauthorities in their eagerness to enforce it have travestied it into the\r\nmisleading maxim, \"That attack is the best defence.\" Hence again an\r\namateurish notion that defence is always stupid or pusillanimous, leading\r\nalways to defeat, and that what is called \"the military spirit\" means\r\nnothing but taking the offensive. Nothing is further from the teaching or\r\nthe practice of the best masters. Like Wellington at Torres Vedras, they\r\nall at times used the defensive till the elements of strength inherent in\r\nthat form of war, as opposed to the exhausting strain inherent in the form\r\nthat they had fixed upon their opponents, lifted them to a position where\r\nthey in their turn were relatively strong enough to use the more exhausting\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe confusion of thought which has led to the misconceptions about defence\r\nas a method of war is due to several obvious causes. Counter-attacks from a\r\ngeneral defensive attitude have been regarded as a true offensive, as, for\r\ninstance, in Frederick the Great's best-known operations, or in Admiral\r\nTegetthoff's brilliant counterstroke at Lissa, or our own operations\r\nagainst the Spanish Armada. Again, the defensive has acquired an ill name\r\nby its being confused with a wrongly arrested offensive, where the superior\r\nPower with the positive object lacked the spirit to use his material\r\nsuperiority with sufficient activity and perseverance. Against such a Power\r\nan inferior enemy can always redress his inferiority by passing to a bold\r\nand quick offensive, thus acquiring a momentum both moral and physical\r\nwhich more than compensates his lack of weight. The defensive has also\r\nfailed by the choice of a bad position which the enemy was able to turn or\r\navoid. A defensive attitude is nothing at all, its elements of strength\r\nentirely disappear, unless it is such that the enemy must break it down by\r\nforce before he can reach his ultimate objective. Even more often has it\r\nfailed when the belligerent adopting it, finding he has no available\r\ndefensive position which will bar the enemy's progress, attempts to guard\r\nevery possible line of attack. The result is of course that by attenuating\r\nhis force he only accentuates his inferiority.\r\n\r\nClear and well proven as these considerations are for land warfare, their\r\napplication to the sea is not so obvious. It will be objected that at sea\r\nthere is no defensive. This is generally true for tactics, but even so not\r\nuniversally true. Defensive tactical positions are possible at sea, as in\r\ndefended anchorages. These were always a reality, and the mine has\r\nincreased their possibilities. In the latest developments of naval warfare\r\nwe have seen the Japanese at the Elliot Islands preparing a real defensive\r\nposition to cover the landing of their Second Army in the Liaotung\r\nPeninsula. Strategically the proposition is not true at all. A strategical\r\ndefensive has been quite as common at sea as on land, and our own gravest\r\nproblems have often been how to break down such an attitude when our enemy\r\nassumed it. It usually meant that the enemy remained in his own waters and\r\nnear his own bases, where it was almost impossible for us to attack him\r\nwith decisive result, and whence he always threatened us with counterattack\r\nat moments of exhaustion, as the Dutch did at Sole Bay and in the Medway.\r\nThe difficulty of dealing decisively with an enemy who adopted this course\r\nwas realised by our service very early, and from first to last one of our\r\nchief preoccupations was to prevent the enemy availing himself of this\r\ndevice and to force him to fight in the open, or at least to get between\r\nhim and his base and force an action there.\r\n\r\nProbably the most remarkable manifestation of the advantages that may be\r\nderived in suitable conditions from a strategical defensive is also to be\r\nfound in the late Russo-Japanese War. In the final crisis of the naval\r\nstruggle the Japanese fleet was able to take advantage of a defensive\r\nattitude in its own waters which the Russian Baltic fleet would have to\r\nbreak down to attain its end, and the result was the most decisive naval\r\nvictory ever recorded.\r\n\r\nThe deterrent power of active and dexterous operations from such a position\r\nwas well known to our old tradition. The device was used several times,\r\nparticularly in our home waters, to prevent a fleet, which for the time we\r\nwere locally too weak to destroy, from carrying out the work assigned to\r\nit. A typical position of the kind was off Scilly, and it was proved again\r\nand again that even a superior fleet could not hope to effect anything in\r\nthe Channel till the fleet off Scilly had been brought to decisive action.\r\nBut the essence of the device was the preservation of the aggressive spirit\r\nin its most daring form. For success it depended on at least the will to\r\nseize every occasion for bold and harassing counter-attacks such as Drake\r\nand his colleagues struck at the Armada.\r\n\r\nTo submit to blockade in order to engage the attention of a superior\r\nenemy's fleet is another form of defensive, but one that is almost wholly\r\nevil. For a short time it may do good by permitting offensive operations\r\nelsewhere which otherwise would be impossible. But if prolonged, it will\r\nsooner or later destroy the spirit of your force and render it incapable of\r\neffective aggression.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion then is that although for the practical purpose of framing\r\nor appreciating plans of war the classification of wars into offensive and\r\ndefensive is of little use, a clear apprehension of the inherent relative\r\nadvantages of offence and defence is essential. We must realise that in\r\ncertain cases, provided always we preserve the aggressive spirit, the\r\ndefensive will enable an inferior force to achieve points when the\r\noffensive would probably lead to its destruction. But the elements of\r\nstrength depend entirely on the will and insight to deal rapid blows in the\r\nenemy's unguarded moments. So soon as the defensive ceases to be regarded\r\nas a means of fostering power to strike and of reducing the enemy's power\r\nof attack it loses all its strength. It ceases to be even a suspended\r\nactivity, and anything that is not activity is not war.\r\n\r\nWith these general indications of the relative advantages of offence and\r\ndefence we may leave the subject for the present. It is possible of course\r\nto catalogue the advantages and disadvantages of each form, but any such\r\nbald statement--without concrete examples to explain the meaning--must\r\nalways appear controversial and is apt to mislead. It is better to reserve\r\ntheir fuller consideration till we come to deal with strategical operations\r\nand are able to note their actual effect upon the conduct of war in its\r\nvarious forms. Leaving therefore our first classification of wars into\r\noffensive and defensive we will pass on to the second, which is the only\r\none of real practical importance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   CHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n                  NATURES OF WARS--\r\n               LIMITED AND UNLIMITED\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second classification to which we are led by the political theory of\r\nwar, is one which Clausewitz was the first to formulate and one to which he\r\ncame to attach the highest importance. It becomes necessary therefore to\r\nexamine his views in some detail--not because there is any need to regard a\r\ncontinental soldier, however distinguished, as an indispensable authority\r\nfor a maritime nation. The reason is quite the reverse. It is because a\r\ncareful examination of his doctrine on this point will lay open what are\r\nthe radical and essential differences between the German or Continental\r\nSchool of Strategy and the British or Maritime School--that is, our own\r\ntraditional School, which too many writers both at home and abroad quietly\r\nassume to have no existence. The evil tendency of that assumption cannot be\r\ntoo strongly emphasised, and the main purpose of this and the following\r\nchapters will be to show how and why even the greatest of the continental\r\nstrategists fell short of realising fully the characteristic conception of\r\nthe British tradition.\r\n\r\nBy the classification in question Clausewitz distinguished wars into those\r\nwith a \"Limited\" object and those whose object was \"Unlimited.\" Such a\r\nclassification was entirely characteristic of him, for it rested not alone\r\nupon the material nature of the object, but on certain moral considerations\r\nto which he was the first to attach their real value in war. Other writers\r\nsuch as Jomini had attempted to classify wars by the special purpose for\r\nwhich they were fought, but Clausewitz's long course of study convinced him\r\nthat such a distinction was unphilosophical and bore no just relation to\r\nany tenable theory of war. Whether, that is, a war was positive or negative\r\nmattered much, but its special purpose, whether, for instance, according to\r\nJomini's system, it was a war \"to assert rights\" or \"to assist an ally\" or\r\n\"to acquire territory,\" mattered not at all.\r\n\r\nWhatever the object, the vital and paramount question was the intensity\r\nwith which the spirit of the nation was absorbed in its attainment. The\r\nreal point to determine in approaching any war plan was what did the object\r\nmean to the two belligerents, what sacrifices would they make for it, what\r\nrisks were they prepared to run? It was thus he stated his view. \"The\r\nsmaller the sacrifice we demand from our opponent, the smaller presumably\r\nwill be the means of resistance he will employ, and the smaller his means,\r\nthe smaller will ours be required to be. Similarly the smaller our\r\npolitical object, the less value shall we set upon it and the more easily\r\nwe shall be induced to abandon it.\" Thus the political object of the war,\r\nits original motive, will not only determine for both belligerents\r\nreciprocally the aim of the force they use, but it will also be the\r\nstandard of the intensity of the efforts they will make. So he concludes\r\nthere may be wars of all degrees of importance and energy from a war of\r\nextermination down to the use of an army of observation. So also in the\r\nnaval sphere there may be a life and death struggle for maritime supremacy\r\nor hostilities which never rise beyond a blockade.\r\n\r\nSuch a view of the subject was of course a wide departure from the theory\r\nof \"Absolute War\" on which Clausewitz had started working. Under that\r\ntheory \"Absolute War\" was the ideal form to which all war ought to attain,\r\nand those which fell short of it were imperfect wars cramped by a lack of\r\ntrue military spirit. But so soon as he had seized the fact that in actual\r\nlife the moral factor always must override the purely military factor, he\r\nsaw that he had been working on too narrow a basis--a basis that was purely\r\ntheoretical in that it ignored the human factor. He began to perceive that\r\nit was logically unsound to assume as the foundation of a strategical\r\nsystem that there was one pattern to which all wars ought to conform. In\r\nthe light of his full and final apprehension of the value of the human\r\nfactor he saw wars falling into two well-marked categories, each of which\r\nwould legitimately be approached in a radically different manner, and not\r\nnecessarily on the lines of \"Absolute War.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw that there was one class of war where the political object was of so\r\nvital an importance to both belligerents that they would tend to fight to\r\nthe utmost limit of their endurance to secure it. But there was another\r\nclass where the object was of less importance, that is to say, where its\r\nvalue to one or both the belligerents was not so great as to be worth\r\nunlimited sacrifices of blood and treasure. It was these two kinds of war\r\nhe designated provisionally \"Unlimited\" and \"Limited,\" by which he meant\r\nnot that you were not to exert the force employed with all the vigour you\r\ncould develop, but that there might be a limit beyond which it would be bad\r\npolicy to spend that vigour, a point at which, long before your force was\r\nexhausted or even fully developed, it would be wiser to abandon your object\r\nrather than to spend more upon it.\r\n\r\nThis distinction it is very necessary to grasp quite clearly, for it is\r\noften superficially confused with the distinction already referred to,\r\nwhich Clausewitz drew in the earlier part of his work--that is, the\r\ndistinction between what he called the character of modern war and the\r\ncharacter of the wars which preceded the Napoleonic era. It will be\r\nremembered he insisted that the wars of his own time had been wars between\r\narmed nations with a tendency to throw the whole weight of the nation into\r\nthe fighting line, whereas in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries wars\r\nwere waged by standing armies and not by the whole nation in arms. The\r\ndistinction of course is real and of far-reaching consequences, but it has\r\nno relation to the distinction between \"Limited\" and \"Unlimited\" war. War\r\nmay be waged on the Napoleonic system either for a limited or an unlimited\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nA modern instance will serve to clear the field. The recent Russo-Japanese\r\nWar was fought for a limited object--the assertion of certain claims over\r\nterritory which formed no part of the possessions of either belligerent.\r\nHostilities were conducted on entirely modern lines by two armed nations\r\nand not by standing armies alone. But in the case of one belligerent her\r\ninterest in the object was so limited as to cause her to abandon it long\r\nbefore her whole force as an armed nation was exhausted or even put forth.\r\nThe expense of life and treasure which the struggle was involving was\r\nbeyond what the object was worth.\r\n\r\nThis second distinction--that is, between Limited and Unlimited\r\nwars--Clausewitz regarded as of greater importance than his previous one\r\nfounded on the negative or positive nature of the object. He was long in\r\nreaching it. His great work _On War_ as he left it proceeds almost entirely\r\non the conception of offensive or defensive as applied to the Napoleonic\r\nideal of absolute war. The new idea came to him towards the end in the full\r\nmaturity of his prolonged study, and it came to him in endeavouring to\r\napply his strategical speculations to the practical process of framing a\r\nwar plan in anticipation of a threatened breach with France. It was only in\r\nhis final section _On War Plans_ that he began to deal with it. By that\r\ntime he had grasped the first practical result to which his theory led. He\r\nsaw that the distinction between Limited and Unlimited war connoted a\r\ncardinal distinction in the methods of waging it. When the object was\r\nunlimited, and would consequently call forth your enemy's whole war power,\r\nit was evident that no firm decision of the struggle could be reached till\r\nhis war power was entirely crushed. Unless you had a reasonable hope of\r\nbeing able to do this it was bad policy to seek your end by force--that is,\r\nyou ought not to go to war. In the case of a limited object, however, the\r\ncomplete destruction of the enemy's armed force was beyond what was\r\nnecessary. Clearly you could achieve your end if you could seize the\r\nobject, and by availing yourself of the elements of strength inherent in\r\nthe defensive could set up such a situation that it would cost the enemy\r\nmore to turn you out than the object was worth to him.\r\n\r\nHere then was a wide difference in the fundamental postulate of your war\r\nplan. In the case of an unlimited war your main strategical offensive must\r\nbe directed against the armed forces of the enemy; in the case of a limited\r\nwar, even where its object was positive, it need not be. If conditions were\r\nfavourable, it would suffice to make the object itself the objective of\r\nyour main strategical offensive. Clearly, then, he had reached a\r\ntheoretical distinction which modified his whole conception of strategy. No\r\nlonger is there logically but one kind of war, the Absolute, and no longer\r\nis there but one legitimate objective, the enemy's armed forces. Being\r\nsound theory, it of course had an immediate practical value, for obviously\r\nit was a distinction from which the actual work of framing a war plan must\r\ntake its departure.\r\n\r\nA curious corroboration of the soundness of these views is that Jomini\r\nreached an almost identical standpoint independently and by an entirely\r\ndifferent road. His method was severely concrete, based on the comparison\r\nof observed facts, but it brought him as surely as the abstract method of\r\nhis rival to the conclusion that there were two distinct classes of object.\r\n\"They are of two different kinds,\" he says, \"one which may be called\r\nterritorial or geographical ... the other on the contrary consists\r\nexclusively in the destruction or disorganisation of the enemy's forces\r\nwithout concerning yourself with geographical points of any kind.\" It is\r\nunder the first category of his first main classification \"Of offensive\r\nwars to assert rights,\" that he deals with what Clausewitz would call\r\n\"Limited Wars.\" Citing as an example Frederick the Great's war for the\r\nconquest of Silesia, he says, \"In such a war ... the offensive operations\r\nought to be proportional to the end in view. The first move is naturally to\r\noccupy the provinces claimed\" (not, be it noted, to direct your blow at the\r\nenemy's main force). \"Afterwards,\" he proceeds, \"you can push the offensive\r\naccording to circumstances and your relative strength in order to obtain\r\nthe desired cession by menacing the enemy at home.\" Here we have\r\nClausewitz's whole doctrine of \"Limited War\"; firstly, the primary or\r\nterritorial stage, in which you endeavour to occupy the geographical\r\nobject, and then the secondary or coercive stage, in which you seek by\r\nexerting general pressure upon your enemy to force him to accept the\r\nadverse situation you have set up.\r\n\r\nSuch a method of making war obviously differs in a fundamental manner from\r\nthat which Napoleon habitually adopted, and yet we have it presented by\r\nJomini and Clausewitz, the two apostles of the Napoleonic method. The\r\nexplanation is, of course, that both of them had seen too much not to know\r\nthat Napoleon's method was only applicable when you could command a real\r\nphysical or moral preponderance. Given such a preponderance, both were\r\nstaunch for the use of extreme means in Napoleon's manner. It is not as\r\nsomething better than the higher road that they commend the lower one, but\r\nbeing veteran staff-officers and not mere theorists, they knew well that a\r\nbelligerent must sometimes find the higher road beyond his strength, or\r\nbeyond the effort which the spirit of the nation is prepared to make for\r\nthe end in view, and like the practical men they were, they set themselves\r\nto study the potentialities of the lower road should hard necessity force\r\nthem to travel it. They found that these potentialities in certain\r\ncircumstances were great. As an example of a case where the lower form was\r\nmore appropriate Jomini cites Napoleon's campaign against Russia in 1812.\r\nIn his opinion it would have been better if Napoleon had been satisfied to\r\nbegin on the lower method with a limited territorial object, and he\r\nattributes his failure to the abuse of a method which, however well suited\r\nto his wars in Germany, was incapable of achieving success in the\r\nconditions presented by a war with Russia.\r\n\r\nSeeing how high was Napoleon's opinion of Jomini as a master of the science\r\nof war, it is curious how his views on the two natures of wars have been\r\nignored in the present day. It is even more curious in the case of\r\nClausewitz, since we know that in the plenitude of his powers he came to\r\nregard this classification as the master-key of the subject. The\r\nexplanation is that the distinction is not very clearly formulated in his\r\nfirst seven books, which alone he left in anything like a finished\r\ncondition. It was not till he came to write his eighth book _On War Plans_\r\nthat he saw the vital importance of the distinction round which he had been\r\nhovering. In that book the distinction is clearly laid down, but the book\r\nunhappily was never completed. With his manuscript, however, he left a\r\n\"Note\" warning us against regarding his earlier books as a full\r\npresentation of his developed ideas. From the note it is also evident that\r\nhe thought the classification on which he had lighted was of the utmost\r\nimportance, that he believed it would clear up all the difficulties which\r\nhe had encountered in his earlier books--difficulties which he had come to\r\nsee arose from a too exclusive consideration of the Napoleonic method of\r\nconducting war. \"I look upon the first six books,\" he wrote in 1827, \"as\r\nonly a mass of material which is still in a manner without form and which\r\nhas still to be revised again. In this revision the two kinds of wars will\r\nbe kept more distinctly in view all through, and thereby all ideas will\r\ngain in clearness, in precision, and in exactness of application.\"\r\nEvidently he had grown dissatisfied with the theory of Absolute War on\r\nwhich he had started. His new discovery had convinced him that that theory\r\nwould not serve as a standard for all natures of wars. \"Shall we,\" he asks\r\nin his final book, \"shall we now rest satisfied with this idea and by it\r\njudge of all wars, however much they may differ?\"[2] He answers his\r\nquestion in the negative. \"You cannot determine the requirements of all\r\nwars from the Napoleonic type. Keep that type and its absolute method\r\nbefore you to use _when you can_ or _when you must_, but keep equally\r\nbefore you that there are two main natures of war.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] Clausewitz, On War, Book viii, chap, ii\r\n\r\nIn his note written at this time, when the distinction first came to him,\r\nhe defines these two natures of war as follows: \"First, those in which the\r\nobject is the _overthrow of the enemy_, whether it be we aim at his\r\npolitical destruction or merely at disarming him and forcing him to\r\nconclude peace on our terms; and secondly, those in which our object is\r\n_merely to make some conquests on the frontiers of his country_, either for\r\nthe purpose of retaining them permanently or of turning them to account as\r\na matter of exchange in settling terms of peace.\"[3] It was in his eighth\r\nbook that he intended, had he lived, to have worked out the comprehensive\r\nidea he had conceived. Of that book he says, \"The chief object will be to\r\nmake good the two points of view above mentioned, by which everything will\r\nbe simplified and at the same time be given the breath of life. I hope in\r\nthis book to iron out many creases in the heads of strategists and\r\nstatesmen, and at least to show the object of action and the real point to\r\nbe considered in war.\"[4]\r\n\r\n  [3] Ibid, Preparatory Notice, p. vii.\r\n\r\n  [4] Ibid, p. viii\r\n\r\nThat hope was never realised, and that perhaps is why his penetrating\r\nanalysis has been so much ignored. The eighth book as we have it is only a\r\nfragment. In the spring of 1830--an anxious moment, when it seemed that\r\nPrussia would require all her best for another struggle single-handed with\r\nFrance--he was called away to an active command. What he left of the book\r\non \"War Plans\" he describes as \"merely a track roughly cleared, as it were,\r\nthrough the mass, in order to ascertain the points of greatest moment.\" It\r\nwas his intention, he says, to \"carry the spirit of these ideas into his\r\nfirst six books\"--to put the crown on his work, in fact, by elaborating and\r\ninsisting upon his two great propositions, viz. that war was a form of\r\npolicy, and that being so it might be Limited or Unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which he would have infused his new idea into the whole every\r\none is at liberty to judge for himself; but this indisputable fact remains.\r\nIn the winter in view of the threatening attitude of France in regard to\r\nBelgium he drew up a war plan, and it was designed not on the Napoleonic\r\nmethod of making the enemy's armed force the main strategical objective,\r\nbut on seizing a limited territorial object and forcing a disadvantageous\r\ncounter-offensive upon the French. The revolutionary movement throughout\r\nEurope had broken the Holy Alliance to pieces. Not only did Prussia find\r\nherself almost single-handed against France, but she herself was sapped by\r\nrevolution. To adopt the higher form of war and seek to destroy the armed\r\nforce of the enemy was beyond her power. But she could still use the lower\r\nform, and by seizing Belgium she could herself force so exhausting a task\r\non France that success was well within her strength. It was exactly so we\r\nendeavoured to begin the Seven Years' War; and it was exactly so the\r\nJapanese successfully conducted their war with Russia; and what is more\r\nstriking, it was on similar lines that in 1859 Moltke in similar\r\ncircumstances drew up his first war plan against France. His idea at that\r\ntime was on the lines which Jomini held should have been Napoleon's in\r\n1812. It was not to strike directly at Paris or the French main army, but\r\nto occupy Alsace-Lorraine and hold that territory till altered conditions\r\nshould give him the necessary preponderance for proceeding to the higher\r\nform or forcing a favourable peace.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, then, we have to note that the matured fruit of the\r\nNapoleonic period was a theory of war based not on the single absolute\r\nidea, but on the dual distinction of Limited and Unlimited. Whatever\r\npractical importance we may attach to the distinction, so much must be\r\nadmitted on the clear and emphatic pronouncements of Clausewitz and Jomini.\r\nThe practical importance is another matter. It may fairly be argued that in\r\ncontinental warfare--in spite of the instances quoted by both the classical\r\nwriters--it is not very great, for reasons that will appear directly. But\r\nit must be remembered that continental warfare is not the only form in\r\nwhich great international issues are decided. Standing at the final point\r\nwhich Clausewitz and Jomini reached, we are indeed only on the threshold of\r\nthe subject. We have to begin where they left off and inquire what their\r\nideas have to tell for the modern conditions of worldwide imperial States,\r\nwhere the sea becomes a direct and vital factor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   CHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n        LIMITED WAR AND MARITIME EMPIRES--\r\n\r\n   Development of Clausewitz's and Jomini's\r\n   Theory of a Limited Territorial Object, and Its\r\n   Application to Modern Imperial Conditions\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German war plans already cited, which were based respectively on the\r\noccupation of Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine, and Jomini's remarks on\r\nNapoleon's disastrous Russian campaign serve well to show the point to\r\nwhich continental strategists have advanced along the road which Clausewitz\r\nwas the first to indicate clearly. We have now to consider its application\r\nto modern imperial conditions, and above all where the maritime element\r\nforcibly asserts itself. We shall then see how small that advance has been\r\ncompared with its far-reaching effects for a maritime and above all an\r\ninsular Power.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Clausewitz himself never apprehended the full significance\r\nof his brilliant theory. His outlook was still purely continental, and the\r\nlimitations of continental warfare tend to veil the fuller meaning of the\r\nprinciple he had framed. Had he lived, there is little doubt he would have\r\nworked it out to its logical conclusion, but his death condemned his theory\r\nof limited war to remain in the inchoate condition in which he had left it.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, as was natural enough, that all through his work\r\nClausewitz had in his mind war between two contiguous or at least adjacent\r\ncontinental States, and a moment's consideration will show that in that\r\ntype of war the principle of the limited object can rarely if ever assert\r\nitself in perfect precision. Clausewitz himself put it quite clearly.\r\nAssuming a case where \"the overthrow of the enemy\"--that is, unlimited\r\nwar--is beyond our strength, he points out that we need not therefore\r\nnecessarily act on the defensive. Our action may still be positive and\r\noffensive, but the object can be nothing more than \"the conquest of part of\r\nthe enemy's country.\" Such a conquest he knew might so far weaken your\r\nenemy or strengthen your own position as to enable you to secure a\r\nsatisfactory peace. The path of history is indeed strewn with such cases.\r\nBut he was careful to point out that such a form of war was open to the\r\ngravest objections. Once you had occupied the territory you aimed at, your\r\noffensive action was, as a rule, arrested. A defensive attitude had to be\r\nassumed, and such an arrest of offensive action he had previously shown was\r\ninherently vicious, if only for moral reasons. Added to this you might find\r\nthat in your effort to occupy the territorial object you had so\r\nirretrievably separated your striking force from your home-defence force as\r\nto be in no position to meet your enemy if he was able to retort by acting\r\non unlimited lines with a stroke at your heart. A case in point was the\r\nAusterlitz campaign, where Austria's object was to wrest North Italy from\r\nNapoleon's empire. She sent her main army under the Archduke Charles to\r\nseize the territory she desired. Napoleon immediately struck at Vienna,\r\ndestroyed her home army, and occupied the capital before the Archduke could\r\nturn to bar his way.\r\n\r\nThe argument is this: that, as all strategic attack tends to leave points\r\nof your own uncovered, it always involves greater or less provision for\r\ntheir defence. It is obvious, therefore, that if we are aiming at a limited\r\nterritorial object the proportion of defence required will tend to be much\r\ngreater than if we are directing our attack on the main forces of the\r\nenemy. In unlimited war our attack will itself tend to defend everything\r\nelsewhere, by forcing the enemy to concentrate against our attack. Whether\r\nthe limited form is justifiable or not therefore depends, as Clausewitz\r\npoints out, on the geographical position of the object.\r\n\r\nSo far British experience is with him, but he then goes on to say the more\r\nclosely the territory in question is an annex of our own the safer is this\r\nform of war, because then our offensive action will the more surely cover\r\nour home country. As a case in point he cites Frederick the Great's opening\r\nof the Seven Years' War with the occupation of Saxony--a piece of work\r\nwhich materially strengthened Prussian defence. Of the British opening in\r\nCanada he says nothing. His outlook was too exclusively continental for it\r\nto occur to him to test his doctrine with a conspicuously successful case\r\nin which the territory aimed at was distant from the home territory and in\r\nno way covered it. Had he done so he must have seen how much stronger an\r\nexample of the strength of limited war was the case of Canada than the case\r\nof Saxony. Moreover, he would have seen that the difficulties, which in\r\nspite of his faith in his discovery accompanied his attempt to apply it,\r\narose from the fact that the examples he selected were not really examples\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nWhen he conceived the idea, the only kind of limited object he had in his\r\nmind was, to use his own words, \"some conquests on the frontiers of the\r\nenemy's country,\" such as Silesia and Saxony for Frederick the Great,\r\nBelgium in his own war plan, and Alsace-Lorraine in that of Moltke. Now it\r\nis obvious that such objects are not truly limited, for two reasons. In the\r\nfirst place, such territory is usually an organic part of your enemy's\r\ncountry, or otherwise of so much importance to him that he will be willing\r\nto use unlimited effort to retain it. In the second place, there will be no\r\nstrategical obstacle to his being able to use his whole force to that end.\r\nTo satisfy the full conception of a limited object, one of two conditions\r\nis essential. Firstly, it must be not merely limited in area, but of really\r\nlimited political importance; and secondly, it must be so situated as to be\r\nstrategically isolated or to be capable of being reduced to practical\r\nisolation by strategical operations. Unless this condition exists, it is in\r\nthe power of either belligerent, as Clausewitz himself saw, to pass to\r\nunlimited war if he so desires, and, ignoring the territorial objective, to\r\nstrike at the heart of his enemy and force him to desist.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we only regard war between contiguous continental States, in\r\nwhich the object is the conquest of territory on either of their frontiers,\r\nwe get no real generic difference between limited and unlimited war. The\r\nline between them is in any case too shadowy or unstable to give a\r\nclassification of any solidity. It is a difference of degree rather than of\r\nkind. If, on the other hand, we extend our view to wars between worldwide\r\nempires, the distinction at once becomes organic. Possessions which lie\r\noversea or at the extremities of vast areas of imperfectly settled\r\nterritory are in an entirely different category from those limited objects\r\nwhich Clausewitz contemplated. History shows that they can never have the\r\npolitical importance of objects which are organically part of the European\r\nsystem, and it shows further that they can be isolated by naval action\r\nsufficiently to set up the conditions of true limited war.\r\n\r\nJomini approaches the point, but without clearly detaching it. In his\r\nchapter \"On Great Invasions and Distant Expeditions,\" he points out how\r\nunsafe it is to take the conditions of war between contiguous States and\r\napply them crudely to cases where the belligerents are separated by large\r\nareas of land or sea. He hovers round the sea factor, feeling how great a\r\ndifference it makes, but without getting close to the real distinction. His\r\nconception of the inter-action of fleets and armies never rises above their\r\nactual co-operation in touch one with the other in a distant theatre. He\r\nhas in mind the assistance which the British fleet afforded Wellington in\r\nthe Peninsula, and Napoleon's dreams of Asiatic conquest, pronouncing such\r\ndistant invasions as impossible in modern times except perhaps in\r\ncombination with a powerful fleet that could provide the army of invasion\r\nwith successive advanced bases. Of the paramount value of the fleet's\r\nisolating and preventive functions he gives no hint.\r\n\r\nEven when he deals with oversea expeditions, as he does at some length, his\r\ngrip of the point is no closer. It is indeed significant of how entirely\r\ncontinental thought had failed to penetrate the subject that in devoting\r\nover thirty pages to an enumeration of the principles of oversea\r\nexpeditions, he, like Clausewitz, does not so much as mention the conquest\r\nof Canada; and yet it is the leading case of a weak military Power\r\nsucceeding by the use of the limited form of war in forcing its will upon a\r\nstrong one, and succeeding because it was able by naval action to secure\r\nits home defence and isolate the territorial object.\r\n\r\nFor our ideas of true limited objects, therefore, we must leave the\r\ncontinental theatres and turn to mixed or maritime wars. We have to look to\r\nsuch cases as Canada and Havana in the Seven Years' War, and Cuba in the\r\nSpanish-American War, cases in which complete isolation of the object by\r\nnaval action was possible, or to such examples as the Crimea and Korea,\r\nwhere sufficient isolation was attainable by naval action owing to the\r\nlength and difficulty of the enemy's land communications and to the\r\nstrategical situation of the territory at stake.\r\n\r\nThese examples will also serve to illustrate and enforce the second\r\nessential of this kind of war. As has been already said, for a true limited\r\nobject we must have not only the power of isolation, but also the power by\r\na secure home defence of barring an unlimited counterstroke. In all the\r\nabove cases this condition existed. In all of them the belligerents had no\r\ncontiguous frontiers, and this point is vital. For it is obvious that if\r\ntwo belligerents have a common frontier, it is open to the superior of\r\nthem, no matter how distant or how easy to isolate the limited object may\r\nbe, to pass at will to unlimited war by invasion. This process is even\r\npossible when the belligerents are separated by a neutral State, since the\r\nterritory of a weak neutral will be violated if the object be of sufficient\r\nimportance, or if the neutral be too strong to coerce, there still remains\r\nthe possibility that his alliance may be secured.\r\n\r\nWe come, then, to this final proposition--that limited war is only\r\npermanently possible to island Powers or between Powers which are separated\r\nby sea, and then only when the Power desiring limited war is able to\r\ncommand the sea to such a degree as to be able not only to isolate the\r\ndistant object, but also to render impossible the invasion of his home\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we reach the true meaning and highest military value of what we\r\ncall the command of the sea, and here we touch the secret of England's\r\nsuccess against Powers so greatly superior to herself in military strength.\r\nIt is only fitting that such a secret should have been first penetrated by\r\nan Englishman. For so it was, though it must be said that except in the\r\nlight of Clausewitz's doctrine the full meaning of Bacon's famous aphorism\r\nis not revealed. \"This much is certain,\" said the great Elizabethan on the\r\nexperience of our first imperial war; \"he that commands the sea is at great\r\nliberty and may take as much or as little of the war as he will, whereas\r\nthose that be strongest by land are many times nevertheless in great\r\nstraits.\" It would be difficult to state more pithily the ultimate\r\nsignificance of Clausewitz's doctrine. Its cardinal truth is clearly\r\nindicated--that limited wars do not turn upon the armed strength of the\r\nbelligerents, but upon the amount of that strength which they are able or\r\nwilling to bring to bear at the decisive point.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that Clausewitz did not live to see with Bacon's\r\neyes and to work out the full comprehensiveness of his doctrine. His\r\nambition was to formulate a theory which would explain all wars. He\r\nbelieved he had done so, and yet it is clear he never knew how complete was\r\nhis success, nor how wide was the field he had covered. To the end it would\r\nseem he was unaware that he had found an explanation of one of the most\r\ninscrutable problems in history--the expansion of England--at least so far\r\nas it has been due to successful war. That a small country with a weak army\r\nshould have been able to gather to herself the most desirable regions of\r\nthe earth, and to gather them at the expense of the greatest military\r\nPowers, is a paradox to which such Powers find it hard to be reconciled.\r\nThe phenomenon seemed always a matter of chance-an accident without any\r\nfoundation in the essential constants of war. It remained for Clausewitz,\r\nunknown to himself, to discover that explanation, and he reveals it to us\r\nin the inherent strength of limited war when means and conditions are\r\nfavourable for its use.\r\n\r\nWe find, then, if we take a wider view than was open to Clausewitz and\r\nsubmit his latest ideas to the test of present imperial conditions, so far\r\nfrom failing to cover the ground they gain a fuller meaning and a firmer\r\nbasis. Apply them to maritime warfare and it becomes clear that his\r\ndistinction between limited and unlimited war does not rest alone on the\r\nmoral factor. A war may be limited not only because the importance of the\r\nobject is too limited to call forth the whole national force, but also\r\nbecause the sea may be made to present an insuperable physical obstacle to\r\nthe whole national force being brought to bear. That is to say, a war may\r\nbe limited physically by the strategical isolation of the object, as well\r\nas morally by its comparative unimportance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n              WARS OF INTERVENTION--\r\n     LIMITED INTERFERENCE IN UNLIMITED WAR\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the general consideration of limited war, we have still to\r\ndeal with a form of it that has not yet been mentioned. Clausewitz gave it\r\nprovisionally the name of \"War limited by contingent,\" and could find no\r\nplace for it in his system. It appeared to him to differ essentially from\r\nwar limited by its political object, or as Jomini put it, war with a\r\nterritorial object. Yet it had to be taken into account and explained, if\r\nonly for the part it had played in European history.\r\n\r\nFor us it calls for the most careful examination, not only because it\r\nbaffled the great German strategist to reconcile it with his theory of war,\r\nbut also because it is the form in which Great Britain most successfully\r\ndemonstrated the potentiality for direct continental interference of a\r\nsmall army acting in conjunction with a dominant fleet.\r\n\r\nThe combined operations which were the normal expression of the British\r\nmethod of making war on the limited basis were of two main classes.\r\nFirstly, there were those designed purely for the conquest of the objects\r\nfor which we went to war, which were usually colonial or distant oversea\r\nterritory; and secondly, operations more or less upon the European seaboard\r\ndesigned not for permanent conquest, but as a method of disturbing our\r\nenemy's plans and strengthening the hands of our allies and our own\r\nposition. Such operations might take the form of insignificant coastal\r\ndiversions, or they might rise through all degrees of importance till, as\r\nin Wellington's operations in the Peninsula, they became indistinguishable\r\nin form from regular continental warfare.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that these operations were distinguished not so\r\nmuch by the nature of the object as by the fact that we devoted to them,\r\nnot the whole of our military strength, but only a certain part of it which\r\nwas known as our \"disposal force.\" Consequently, they appear to call for\r\nsome such special classification, and to fall naturally into the category\r\nwhich Clausewitz called \"War limited by contingent.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a nature of war well enough known in another form on the Continent.\r\nDuring the eighteenth century there had been a large number of cases of war\r\nactually limited by contingent--that is, cases where a country not having a\r\nvital interest in the object made war by furnishing the chief belligerent\r\nwith an auxiliary force of a stipulated strength.\r\n\r\nIt was in the sixth chapter of his last book that Clausewitz intended to\r\ndeal with this anomalous form of hostility. His untimely death, however,\r\nhas left us with no more than a fragment, in which he confesses that such\r\ncases are \"embarrassing to his theory.\" If, he adds, the auxiliary force\r\nwere placed unreservedly at the disposal of the chief belligerent, the\r\nproblem would be simple enough. It would then, in effect, be the same thing\r\nas unlimited war with the aid of a subsidised force. But in fact, as he\r\nobserves, this seldom happened, for the contingent was always more or less\r\ncontrolled in accordance with the special political aims of the Government\r\nwhich furnished it. Consequently, the only conclusion he succeeded in\r\nreaching was that it was a form of war that had to be taken into account,\r\nand that it was a form of limited war that appeared to differ essentially\r\nfrom war limited by object. We are left, in fact, with an impression that\r\nthere must be two kinds of limited war.\r\n\r\nBut if we pursue his historical method and examine the cases in which this\r\nnature of war was successful, and those in which it was unsuccessful, we\r\nshall find that wherever success is taken as an index of its legitimate\r\nemployment, the practical distinction between the two kinds of limited war\r\ntends to disappear. The indications are that where the essential factors\r\nwhich justify the use of war limited by object are present in war limited\r\nby contingent, then that form of war tends to succeed, but not otherwise.\r\nWe are brought, in fact, to this proposition, that the distinction \"Limited\r\nby contingent\" is not one that is inherent in war, and is quite out of line\r\nwith the theory in hand--that, in reality, it is not a _form_ of war, but a\r\n_method_ which may be employed either for limited or unlimited war. In\r\nother words, war limited by contingent, if it is to be regarded as a\r\nlegitimate form of war at all, must take frankly the one shape or the\r\nother. Either the contingent must act as an organic unit of the force\r\nmaking unlimited war without any reservations whatever, or else it should\r\nbe given a definite territorial object, with an independent organisation\r\nand an independent limited function.\r\n\r\nOur own experience seems to indicate that war by contingent or war with \"a\r\ndisposal force\" attains the highest success when it approaches most closely\r\nto true limited war--that is, as in the case of the Peninsula and the\r\nCrimea, where its object is to wrest or secure from the enemy a definite\r\npiece of territory that to a greater or less extent can be isolated by\r\nnaval action. Its operative power, in fact, appears to bear some direct\r\nrelation to the intimacy with which naval and military action can be\r\ncombined to give the contingent a weight and mobility that are beyond its\r\nintrinsic power.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we would unravel the difficulties of war limited by contingent,\r\nit seems necessary to distinguish between the continental and the British\r\nform of it. The continental form, as we have seen, differs but little in\r\nconception from unlimited war. The contingent is furnished at least\r\nostensibly with the idea that it is to be used by the chief belligerent to\r\nassist him in overthrowing the common enemy, and that its objective will be\r\nthe enemy's organised forces or his capital. Or it may be that the\r\ncontingent is to be used as an army of observation to prevent a\r\ncounterstroke, so as to facilitate and secure the main offensive movement\r\nof the chief belligerent. In either case, however small may be our\r\ncontribution to the allied force, we are using the unlimited form and\r\naiming at an unlimited and not a mere territorial object.\r\n\r\nIf now we turn to British experience of war limited by contingent, we find\r\nthat the continental form has frequently been used, but we also find it\r\nalmost invariably accompanied by a popular repugnance, as though there were\r\nsomething in it antagonistic to the national instinct. A leading case is\r\nthe assistance we sent to Frederick the Great in the Seven Years' War. At\r\nthe opening of the war, so great was the popular repugnance that the\r\nmeasure was found impossible, and it was not till Frederick's dazzling\r\nresistance to the Catholic powers had clothed him with the glory of a\r\nProtestant hero, that Pitt could do what he wanted. The old religious fire\r\nwas stirred. The most potent of all national instincts kindled the people\r\nto a generous warmth which overcame their inborn antipathy to continental\r\noperations, and it was possible to send a substantial contingent to\r\nFrederick's assistance. In the end the support fully achieved its purpose,\r\nbut it must be noted that even in this case the operations were limited not\r\nonly by contingent but also by object. It is true that Frederick was\r\nengaged in an unlimited war in which the continued existence of Prussia was\r\nat stake, and that the British force was an organic element in his war\r\nplan. Nevertheless, it formed part of a British subsidised army under\r\nPrince Ferdinand of Brunswick, who though nominated by Frederick was a\r\nBritish commander-in-chief. His army was in organisation entirely distinct\r\nfrom that of Frederick, and it was assigned the very definite and limited\r\nfunction of preventing the French occupying Hanover and so turning the\r\nPrussian right flank. Finally it must be noted that its ability to perform\r\nthis function was due to the fact that the theatre of operations assigned\r\nto it was such that in no probable event could it lose touch with the sea,\r\nnor could the enemy cut its lines of supply and retreat.\r\n\r\nThese features of the enterprise should be noted. They differentiate it\r\nfrom our earlier use of war limited by contingent in the continental\r\nmanner, of which Marlborough's campaigns were typical, and they exhibit the\r\nspecial form which Marlborough would have chosen had political exigencies\r\npermitted and which was to become characteristic of British effort from\r\nPitt's time onward. In the method of our greatest War Minister we have not\r\nonly the limit by contingent but also the limit of a definite and\r\nindependent function, and finally we have touch with the sea. This is the\r\nreally vital factor, and upon it, as will presently appear, depends the\r\nstrength of the method.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of the Great War we employed the same form in our\r\noperations in North-Western Europe. There we had also the limited function\r\nof securing Holland, and also complete touch with the sea, but our theatre\r\nof operations was not independent. Intimate concerted action with other\r\nforces was involved, and the result in every case was failure. Later on in\r\nSicily, where absolute isolation was attainable, the strength of the method\r\nenabled us to achieve a lasting result with very slender means. But the\r\nresult was purely defensive. It was not till the Peninsular War developed\r\nthat we found a theatre for war limited by contingent in which all the\r\nconditions that make for success were present. Even there so long as our\r\narmy was regarded as a contingent auxiliary to the Spanish army the usual\r\nfailure ensued. Only in Portugal, the defence of which was a true limited\r\nobject, and where we had a sea-girt theatre independent of extraneous\r\nallies, was success achieved from the first. So strong was the method here,\r\nand so exhausting the method which it forced on the enemy, that the local\r\nbalance of force was eventually reversed and we were able to pass to a\r\ndrastic offensive.\r\n\r\nThe real secret of Wellington's success--apart from his own genius--was\r\nthat in perfect conditions he was applying the limited form to an unlimited\r\nwar. Our object was unlimited. It was nothing less than the overthrow of\r\nNapoleon. Complete success at sea had failed to do it, but that success had\r\ngiven us the power of applying the limited form, which was the most\r\ndecisive form of offence within our means. Its substantial contribution to\r\nthe final achievement of the object is now universally recognised.\r\n\r\nThe general result, then, of these considerations is that war by contingent\r\nin the continental form seldom or never differs generically from unlimited\r\nwar, for the conditions required by limited war are seldom or never\r\npresent. But what may be called the British or maritime form is in fact the\r\napplication of the limited method to the unlimited form, as ancillary to\r\nthe larger operations of our allies--a method which has usually been open\r\nto us because the control of the sea has enabled us to select a theatre in\r\neffect truly limited.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] Wellington's view of the essential factor was expressed to Rear\r\n  Admiral Martin, who was sent to Spain by the Admiralty to confer with him\r\n  in September 1813. \"If anyone,\" he said, \"wishes to know the history of\r\n  this war, I will tell them it is our maritime superiority gives me the\r\n  power of maintaining my army while the enemy are unable to do so.\"\r\n  (_Letters of Sir T. Byam Martin_) [Navy Records Society], ii, p. 499.\r\n\r\nBut what if the conditions of the struggle in which we wish to intervene\r\nare such that no truly limited theatre is available? In that case we have\r\nto choose between placing a contingent frankly at the disposal of our ally,\r\nor confining ourselves to coastal diversion, as we did at Frederick the\r\nGreat's request in the early campaigns of the Seven Years' War. Such\r\noperations can seldom be satisfactory to either party. The small positive\r\nresults of our efforts to intervene in this way have indeed done more than\r\nanything to discredit this form of war, and to brand it as unworthy of a\r\nfirst-class Power. Yet the fact remains that all the great continental\r\nmasters of war have feared or valued British intervention of this character\r\neven in the most unfavourable conditions. It was because they looked for\r\nits effects rather in the threat than in the performance. They did not\r\nreckon for positive results at all. So long as such intervention took an\r\namphibious form they knew its disturbing effect upon a European situation\r\nwas always out of all proportion to the intrinsic strength employed or the\r\npositive results it could give. Its operative action was that it threatened\r\npositive results unless it were strongly met. Its effect, in short, was\r\nnegative. Its value lay in its power of containing force greater than its\r\nown. That is all that can be claimed for it, but it may be all that is\r\nrequired. It is not the most drastic method of intervention, but it has\r\nproved itself the most drastic for a Power whose forces are not adapted for\r\nthe higher method. Frederick the Great was the first great soldier to\r\nrecognise it, and Napoleon was the last. For years he shut his eyes to it,\r\nlaughed at it, covered it with a contempt that grew ever more irritable. In\r\n1805 he called Craig's expedition a \"pygmy combination,\" yet the\r\npreparation of another combined force for an entirely different destination\r\ncaused him to see the first as an advance guard of a movement he could not\r\nignore, and he sacrificed his fleet in an impotent effort to deal with it.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, till four years later that he was forced to place on\r\nrecord his recognition of the principle. Then, curiously enough, he was\r\nconvinced by an expedition which we have come to regard as above all others\r\ncondemnatory of amphibious operations against the Continent. The Walcheren\r\nexpedition is now usually held as the leading case of fatuous war\r\nadministration. Historians can find no words too bad for it. They ignore\r\nthe fact that it was a step--the final and most difficult step--in our\r\npost-Trafalgar policy of using the army to perfect our command of the sea\r\nagainst a fleet acting stubbornly on the defensive. It began with\r\nCopenhagen in 1807. It failed at the Dardanelles because fleet and army\r\nwere separated; it succeeded at Lisbon and at Cadiz by demonstration alone.\r\nWalcheren, long contemplated, had been put off till the last as the most\r\nformidable and the least pressing. Napoleon had been looking for the\r\nattempt ever since the idea was first broached in this country, but as time\r\npassed and the blow did not fall, the danger came to be more and more\r\nignored. Finally, the moment came when he was heavily engaged in Austria\r\nand forced to call up the bulk of his strength to deal with the Archduke\r\nCharles. The risks were still great, but the British Government faced them\r\nboldly with open eyes. It was now or never. They were bent on developing\r\ntheir utmost military strength in the Peninsula, and so long as a potent\r\nand growing fleet remained in the North Sea it would always act as an\r\nincreasing drag on such development. The prospective gain of success was in\r\nthe eyes of the Government out of all proportion to the probable loss by\r\nfailure. So when Napoleon least expected it they determined to act, and\r\ncaught him napping. The defences of Antwerp had been left incomplete. There\r\nwas no army to meet the blow--nothing but a polyglot rabble without staff\r\nor even officers. For a week at least success was in our hands. Napoleon's\r\nfleet only escaped by twenty-four hours, and yet the failure was not only\r\ncomplete but disastrous. Still so entirely were the causes of failure\r\naccidental, and so near had it come to success, that Napoleon received a\r\nthorough shock and looked for a quick repetition of the attempt. So\r\nseriously indeed did he regard his narrow escape that he found himself\r\ndriven to reconsider his whole system of home defence. Not only did he deem\r\nit necessary to spend large sums in increasing the fixed defences of\r\nAntwerp and Toulon, but his Director of Conscription was called upon to\r\nwork out a scheme for providing a permanent force of no less than 300,000\r\nmen from the National Guard to defend the French coasts. \"With 30,000 men\r\nin transports at the Downs,\" the Emperor wrote, \"the English can paralyse\r\n300,000 of my army, and that will reduce us to the rank of a second-class\r\nPower.\"[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] _Correspondance de Napoléon_, xix, 421, 4 September.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of the British efforts in the Peninsula apparently\r\nrendered the realisation of this project unnecessary--that is, our line of\r\noperation was declared and the threat ceased. But none the less Napoleon's\r\nrecognition of the principle remains on record--not in one of his speeches\r\nmade for some ulterior purpose, but in a staff order to the principal\r\nofficer concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is generally held that modern developments in military organisation and\r\ntransport will enable a great continental Power to ignore such threats.\r\nNapoleon ignored them in the past, but only to verify the truth that in war\r\nto ignore a threat is too often to create an opportunity. Such\r\nopportunities may occur late or early. As both Lord Ligonier and Wolfe laid\r\nit down for such operations, surprise is not necessarily to be looked for\r\nat the beginning. We have usually had to create or wait for our\r\nopportunity--too often because we were either not ready or not bold enough\r\nto seize the first that occurred.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which such intervention has been most potent have been of two\r\nclasses. Firstly, there is the intrusion into a war plan which our enemy\r\nhas designed without allowing for our intervention, and to which he is\r\nirrevocably committed by his opening movements. Secondly, there is\r\nintervention to deprive the enemy of the fruits of victory. This form finds\r\nits efficacy in the principle that unlimited wars are not always decided by\r\nthe destruction of armies. There usually remains the difficult work of\r\nconquering the people afterwards with an exhausted army. The intrusion of a\r\nsmall fresh force from the sea in such cases may suffice to turn the scale,\r\nas it did in the Peninsula, and as, in the opinion of some high\r\nauthorities, it might have done in France in 1871.\r\n\r\nSuch a suggestion will appear to be almost heretical as sinning against the\r\nprinciple which condemns a strategical reserve. We say that the whole\r\navailable force should be developed for the vital period of the struggle.\r\nNo one can be found to dispute it nowadays. It is too obviously true when\r\nit is a question of a conflict between organised forces, but in the absence\r\nof all proof we are entitled to doubt whether it is true for that\r\nexhausting and demoralising period which lies beyond the shock of armies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n     CONDITIONS OF STRENGTH IN LIMITED WAR\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe elements of strength in limited war are closely analogous to those\r\ngenerally inherent in defence. That is to say, that as a correct use of\r\ndefence will sometimes enable an inferior force to gain its end against a\r\nsuperior one, so are there instances in which the correct use of the\r\nlimited form of war has enabled a weak military Power to attain success\r\nagainst a much stronger one, and these instances are too numerous to permit\r\nus to regard the results as accidental.\r\n\r\nAn obvious element of strength is that where the geographical conditions\r\nare favourable we are able by the use of our navy to restrict the amount of\r\nforce our army will have to deal with. We can in fact bring up our fleet to\r\nredress the adverse balance of our land force. But apart from this very\r\npractical reason there is another, which is rooted in the first principles\r\nof strategy.\r\n\r\nIt is that limited war permits the use of the defensive without its usual\r\ndrawbacks to a degree that is impossible in unlimited war. These drawbacks\r\nare chiefly that it tends to surrender the initiative to the enemy and that\r\nit deprives us of the moral exhilaration of the offensive. But in limited\r\nwar, as we shall see, this need not be the case, and if without making\r\nthese sacrifices we are able to act mainly on the defensive our position\r\nbecomes exceedingly strong.\r\n\r\nThe proposition really admits of no doubt. For even if we be not in\r\nwhole-hearted agreement with Clausewitz's doctrine of the strength of\r\ndefence, still we may at least accept Moltke's modification of it. He held\r\nthat the strongest form of war--that is, the form which economically makes\r\nfor the highest development of strength in a given force--is strategic\r\noffensive combined with tactical defensive. Now these are in effect the\r\nconditions which limited war should give--that is, if the theatre and\r\nmethod be rightly chosen. Let it be remembered that the use of this form of\r\nwar presupposes that we are able by superior readiness or mobility or by\r\nbeing more conveniently situated to establish ourselves in the territorial\r\nobject before our opponent can gather strength to prevent us. This done, we\r\nhave the initiative, and the enemy being unable by hypothesis to attack us\r\nat home, must conform to our opening by endeavouring to turn us out. We are\r\nin a position to meet his attack on ground of our own choice and to avail\r\nourselves of such opportunities of counter-attack as his distant and\r\ntherefore exhausting offensive movements are likely to offer. Assuming, as\r\nin our own case we always must assume, that the territorial object is\r\nsea-girt and our enemy is not able to command the sea, such opportunities\r\nare certain to present themselves, and even if they are not used will\r\ngreatly embarrass the main attack--as was abundantly shown in the Russian\r\nnervousness during their advance into the Liaotung Peninsula, due to the\r\nfear of a counter-stroke from the Gulf of Pe-chi-li.\r\n\r\nThe actual situation which this method of procedure sets up is that our\r\nmajor strategy is offensive--that is, our main movement is positive, having\r\nfor its aim the occupation of the territorial object. The minor strategy\r\nthat follows should be in its general lines defensive, designed, so soon as\r\nthe enemy sets about dislodging us, to develop the utmost energy of\r\ncounter-attack which our force and opportunities justify.\r\n\r\nNow if we consider that by universal agreement it is no longer possible in\r\nthe present conditions of land warfare to draw a line between tactics and\r\nminor strategy, we have in our favour for all practical purposes the\r\nidentical position which Moltke regarded as constituting the strongest form\r\nof war. That is to say, our major strategy is offensive and our minor\r\nstrategy is defensive.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the limited form of war has this element of strength over and\r\nabove the unlimited form, it must be correct to use it when we are not\r\nstrong enough to use the more exhausting form and when the object is\r\nlimited; just as much as it is correct to use the defensive when our object\r\nis negative and we are too weak for the offensive. The point is of the\r\nhighest importance, for it is a direct negation of the current doctrine\r\nthat in war there can be but one legitimate object, the overthrow of the\r\nenemy's means of resistance, and that the primary objective must always be\r\nhis armed forces. It raises in fact the whole question as to whether it is\r\nnot sometimes legitimate and even correct to aim directly at the ulterior\r\nobject of the war.\r\n\r\nAn impression appears to prevail--in spite of all that Clausewitz and\r\nJomini had to say on the point--that the question admits of only one\r\nanswer. Von der Goltz, for instance, is particularly emphatic in asserting\r\nthat the overthrow of the enemy must always be the object in modern war. He\r\nlays it down as \"the first principle of modern warfare,\" that \"the\r\nimmediate objective against which all our efforts must be directed is the\r\nhostile main army.\" Similarly Prince Kraft has the maxim that \"the first\r\naim should be to overcome the enemy's army. Everything else, the occupation\r\nof the country, &c., only comes in the second line.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that he here admits that the process of occupying the\r\nenemy's territory is an operation distinct from the overthrow of the\r\nenemy's force. Von der Goltz goes further, and protests against the common\r\nerror of regarding the annihilation of the enemy's principal army as\r\nsynonymous with the complete attainment of the object. He is careful to\r\nassert that the current doctrine only holds good \"when the two belligerent\r\nstates are of approximately the same nature.\" If, then, there are cases in\r\nwhich the occupation of territory must be undertaken as an operation\r\ndistinct from defeating the enemy's forces, and if in such cases the\r\nconditions are such that we can occupy the territory with advantage without\r\nfirst defeating the enemy, it is surely mere pedantry to insist that we\r\nshould put off till to-morrow what we can do better to-day. If the\r\noccupation of the enemy's whole territory is involved, or even a\r\nsubstantial part of it, the German principle of course holds good, but all\r\nwars are not of that character.\r\n\r\nInsistence on the principle of \"overthrow,\" and even its exaggeration, was\r\nof value, in its day, to prevent a recurrence to the old and discredited\r\nmethods. But its work is done, and blind adherence to it without regard to\r\nthe principles on which it rests tends to turn the art of war into mere\r\nbludgeon play.\r\n\r\nClausewitz, at any rate, as General Von Caemmerer has pointed out,[7] was\r\nfar too practical a soldier to commit himself to so abstract a proposition\r\nin all its modern crudity. If it were true, it would never be possible for\r\na weaker Power to make successful war against a stronger one in any cause\r\nwhatever--a conclusion abundantly refuted by historical experience. That\r\nthe higher form like the offensive is the more drastic is certain, if\r\nconditions are suitable for its use, but Clausewitz, it must be remembered,\r\ndistinctly lays it down that such conditions presuppose in the belligerent\r\nemploying the higher form a great physical or moral superiority or a great\r\nspirit of enterprise--an innate propensity for extreme hazards. Jomini did\r\nnot go even so far as this. He certainly would have ruled out \"an innate\r\npropensity to extreme hazards,\" for in his judgment it was this innate\r\npropensity which led Napoleon to abuse the higher form to his own undoing.\r\nSo entirely indeed does history, no less than theory, fail to support the\r\nidea of the one answer, that it would seem that even in Germany a reaction\r\nto Clausewitz's real teaching is beginning. In expounding it Von Caemmerer\r\nsays, \"Since the majority of the most prominent military authors of our\r\ntime uphold the principle that in war our efforts must always be directed\r\nto their utmost limits and that a deliberate employment of lower means\r\nbetrays more or less weakness, I feel bound to declare that the wideness of\r\nClausewitz's views have inspired me with a high degree of admiration.\"\r\n\r\n  [7] _Development of Strategical Science._\r\n\r\nNow what Clausewitz held precisely was this--that when the conditions are\r\nnot favourable for the use of the higher form, the seizure of a small part\r\nof the enemy's territory may be regarded as a correct alternative to\r\ndestroying his armed forces. But he clearly regards this form of war only\r\nas a make-shift. His purely continental outlook prevented his considering\r\nthat there might be cases where the object was actually so limited in\r\ncharacter that the lower form of war would be at once the more effective\r\nand the more economical to use. In continental warfare, as we have seen,\r\nsuch cases can hardly occur, but they tend to declare themselves strongly\r\nwhen the maritime factor is introduced to any serious extent.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of British warfare to take the lower or limited form has\r\nalways been as clearly marked as is the opposite tendency on the Continent.\r\nTo attribute such a tendency, as is sometimes the fashion, to an inherent\r\nlack of warlike spirit is sufficiently contradicted by the results it has\r\nachieved. There is no reason indeed to put it down to anything but a\r\nsagacious instinct for the kind of war that best accords with the\r\nconditions of our existence. So strong has this instinct been that it has\r\nled us usually to apply the lower form not only where the object of the war\r\nwas a well-defined territorial one, but to cases in which its correctness\r\nwas less obvious. As has been explained in the last chapter, we have\r\napplied it, and applied it on the whole with success, when we have been\r\nacting in concert with continental allies for an unlimited object--where,\r\nthat is, the common object has been the overthrow of the common enemy.\r\n\r\nThe choice between the two forms really depends upon the circumstances of\r\neach case. We have to consider whether the political object is in fact\r\nlimited, whether if unlimited in the abstract it can be reduced to a\r\nconcrete object that is limited, and finally whether the strategical\r\nconditions are such as lend themselves to the successful application of the\r\nlimited form.\r\n\r\nWhat we require now is to determine those conditions with greater\r\nexactness, and this will be best done by changing our method to the\r\nconcrete and taking a leading case.\r\n\r\nThe one which presents them in their clearest and simplest form is without\r\ndoubt the recent war between Russia and Japan. Here we have a particularly\r\nstriking example of a small Power having forced her will upon a much\r\ngreater Power without \"overthrowing\" her--that is, without having crushed\r\nher power of resistance. That was entirely beyond the strength of Japan. So\r\nmanifest was the fact that everywhere upon the Continent, where the\r\noverthrow of your enemy was regarded as the only admissible form of war,\r\nthe action of the Japanese in resorting to hostilities was regarded as\r\nmadness. Only in England, with her tradition and instinct for what an\r\nisland Power may achieve by the lower means, was Japan considered to have\r\nany reasonable chance of success.\r\n\r\nThe case is particularly striking; for every one felt that the real object\r\nof the war was in the abstract unlimited, that it was in fact to decide\r\nwhether Russia or Japan was to be the predominant power in the Far East.\r\nLike the Franco-German War of 1870 it had all the aspect of what the\r\nGermans call \"a trial of strength.\" Such a war is one which above all\r\nappears incapable of decision except by the complete overthrow of the one\r\nPower or the other. There was no complication of alliances nor any\r\nexpectation of them. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty had isolated the struggle.\r\nIf ever issue hung on the sheer fighting force of the two belligerents it\r\nwould seem to have been this one. After the event we are inclined to\r\nattribute the result to the moral qualities and superior training and\r\nreadiness of the victors. These qualities indeed played their part, and\r\nthey must not be minimised; but who will contend that if Japan had tried to\r\nmake her war with Russia, as Napoleon made his, she could have fared even\r\nas well as he did? She had no such preponderance as Clausewitz laid down as\r\na condition precedent to attempting the overthrow of her enemy--the\r\nemployment of unlimited war.\r\n\r\nFortunately for her the circumstances did not call for the employment of\r\nsuch extreme means. The political and geographical conditions were such\r\nthat she was able to reduce the intangible object of asserting her prestige\r\nto the purely concrete form of a territorial objective. The penetration of\r\nRussia into Manchuria threatened the absorption of Korea into the Russian\r\nEmpire, and this Japan regarded as fatal to her own position and future\r\ndevelopment. Her power to maintain Korean integrity would be the outward\r\nand visible sign of her ability to assert herself as a Pacific Power. Her\r\nabstract quarrel with Russia could therefore be crystallised into a\r\nconcrete objective in the same way as the quarrel of the Western Powers\r\nwith Russia in 1854 crystallised into the concrete objective of Sebastopol.\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese case the immediate political object was exceptionally well\r\nadapted for the use of limited war. Owing to the geographical position of\r\nKorea and to the vast and undeveloped territories which separate it from\r\nthe centre of Russian power, it could be practically isolated by naval\r\naction. Further than this, it fulfilled the condition to which Clausewitz\r\nattached the greatest importance--that is to say, the seizure of the\r\nparticular object so far from weakening the home defence of Japan would\r\nhave the effect of greatly increasing the strength of her position. Though\r\noffensive in effect and intention it was also, like Frederick's seizure of\r\nSaxony, a sound piece of defensive work. So far from exposing her heart, it\r\nserved to cover it almost impregnably. The reason is plain. Owing to the\r\nwide separation of the two Russian arsenals at Port Arthur and\r\nVladivostock, with a defile controlled by Japan interposed, the Russian\r\nnaval position was very faulty. The only way of correcting it was for\r\nRussia to secure a base in the Straits of Korea, and for this she had been\r\nstriving by diplomatic means at Seoul for some time. Strategically the\r\nintegrity of Korea was for Japan very much what the integrity of the Low\r\nCountries was for us, but in the case of the Low Countries, since they were\r\nincapable of isolation, our power of direct action was always comparatively\r\nweak. Portugal, with its unrivalled strategical harbour at Lisbon, was an\r\nanalogous case in our old oceanic wars, and since it was capable of being\r\nin a measure isolated from the strength of our great rival by naval means\r\nwe were there almost uniformly successful. On the whole it must be said\r\nthat notwithstanding the success we achieved in our long series of wars\r\nwaged on a limited basis, in none of them were the conditions so favourable\r\nfor us as in this case they were for Japan. In none of them did our main\r\noffensive movement so completely secure our home defence. Canada was as\r\neccentric as possible to our line of home defence, while in the Crimea so\r\ncompletely did our offensive uncover the British Islands, that we had to\r\nsupplement our movement against the limited object by sending our main\r\nfighting fleet to hold the exit of the Baltic against the danger of an\r\nunlimited counter-stroke.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] The strategical object with which the Baltic fleet was sent was\r\n  certainly to prevent a counter-stroke--that is, its main function in our\r\n  war plan was negative. Its positive function was minor and diversionary\r\n  only. It also had a political object as a demonstration to further our\r\n  efforts to form a Baltic coalition against Russia, which entirely failed.\r\n  Public opinion mistaking the whole situation expected direct positive\r\n  results from this fleet, even the capture of St. Petersburg. Such an\r\n  operation would have converted the war from a limited one to an unlimited\r\n  one. It would have meant the \"overthrow of the enemy,\" a task quite\r\n  beyond the strength of the allies without the assistance of the Baltic\r\n  Powers, and even so their assistance would not have justified changing\r\n  the nature of the war, unless both Sweden and Russia had been ready to\r\n  make unlimited war and nothing was further from their intention.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it was on this principle that the Japanese conceived the war\r\nfrom the outset matters little. The main considerations are that with so\r\nfavourable a territorial object as Korea limited war was possible in its\r\nmost formidable shape, that the war did in fact develop on limited lines,\r\nand that it was entirely successful. Without waiting to secure the command\r\nof the sea, Japan opened by a surprise seizure of Seoul, and then under\r\ncover of minor operations of the fleet proceeded to complete her occupation\r\nof Korea. As she faced the second stage, that of making good the defence of\r\nher conquest, the admirable nature of her geographical object was further\r\ndisplayed. The theoretical weakness of limited war at this point is the\r\narrest of your offensive action. But in this case such arrest was neither\r\nnecessary nor possible, and for these reasons. To render the conquest\r\nsecure not only must the Korean frontier be made inviolable, but Korea must\r\nbe permanently isolated by sea. This involved the destruction of the\r\nRussian fleet, and this in its turn entailed the reduction of Port Arthur\r\nby military means. Here, then, in the second stage Japan found herself\r\ncommitted to two lines of operation with two distinct objectives, Port\r\nArthur and the Russian army that was slowly concentrating in Manchuria--a\r\nthoroughly vicious situation. So fortunate, however, was the geographical\r\nconformation of the theatre that by promptitude and the bold use of an\r\nuncommanded sea it could be reduced to something far more correct. By\r\ncontinuing the advance of the Korean army into Manchuria and landing\r\nanother force between it and the Port Arthur army the three corps could be\r\nconcentrated and the vicious separation of the lines of operations turned\r\nto good account. They could be combined in such a way as to threaten an\r\nenveloping counter-attack on Liao-yang before the Russian offensive\r\nconcentration could be completed. Not only was Liao-yang the Russian point\r\nof concentration, but it also was a sound position both for defending Korea\r\nand covering the siege of Port Arthur. Once secured, it gave the Japanese\r\nall the advantages of defence and forced the Russians to exhaust themselves\r\nin offensive operations which were beyond their strength. Nor was it only\r\nashore that this advantage was gained. The success of the system, which\r\nculminated in the fall of Port Arthur, went further still. Not only did it\r\nmake Japan relatively superior at sea, but it enabled her to assume a naval\r\ndefensive and so to force the final naval decision on Russia with every\r\nadvantage of time, place, and strength in her own favour.\r\n\r\nBy the battle of Tsushima the territorial object was completely isolated by\r\nsea, and the position of Japan in Korea was rendered as impregnable as that\r\nof Wellington at Torres Vedras. All that remained was to proceed to the\r\nthird stage and demonstrate to Russia that the acceptance of the situation\r\nthat had been set up was more to her advantage than the further attempt to\r\nbreak it down. This the final advance to Mukden accomplished, and Japan\r\nobtained her end very far short of having overthrown her enemy. The\r\noffensive power of Russia had never been so strong, while that of Japan was\r\nalmost if not quite exhausted.\r\n\r\nApproached in this way, the Far Eastern struggle is seen to develop on the\r\nsame lines as all our great maritime wars of the past, which continental\r\nstrategists have so persistently excluded from their field of study. It\r\npresents the normal three phases--the initial offensive movement to seize\r\nthe territorial object, the secondary phase, which forces an attenuated\r\noffensive on the enemy, and the final stage of pressure, in which there is\r\na return to the offensive \"according,\" as Jomini puts it, \"to circumstances\r\nand your relative force in order to obtain the cession desired.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not of course be asked that these phases shall be always clearly\r\ndefined. Strategical analysis can never give exact results. It aims only at\r\napproximations, at groupings which will serve to guide but will always\r\nleave much to the judgment. The three phases in the Russo-Japanese War,\r\nthough unusually well defined, continually overlapped. It must be so; for\r\nin war the effect of an operation is never confined to the limits of its\r\nimmediate or primary intention. Thus the occupation of Korea had the\r\nsecondary defensive effect of covering the home country, while the initial\r\nblow which Admiral Togo delivered at Port Arthur to cover the primary\r\noffensive movement proved, by the demoralisation it caused in the Russian\r\nfleet, to be a distinct step in the secondary phase of isolating the\r\nconquest. In the later stages of the war the line between what was\r\nessential to set up the second phase of perfecting the isolation and the\r\nthird phase of general pressure seems to have grown very nebulous.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage that the Japanese strategy has been most severely\r\ncriticised, and it was just here they seem to have lost hold of the\r\nconception of a limited war, if in fact they had ever securely grasped the\r\nconception as the elder Pitt understood it. It has been argued that in\r\ntheir eagerness to deal a blow at the enemy's main army they neglected to\r\ndevote sufficient force to reduce Port Arthur, an essential step to\r\ncomplete the second phase. Whether or not the exigencies of the case\r\nrendered such distribution of force inevitable or whether it was due to\r\nmiscalculation of difficulties, the result was a most costly set-back. For\r\nnot only did it entail a vast loss of time and life at Port Arthur itself,\r\nbut when the sortie of the Russian fleet in June brought home to them their\r\nerror, the offensive movement on Liao-yang had to be delayed, and the\r\nopportunity passed for a decisive counter-stroke at the enemy's\r\nconcentration ashore.\r\n\r\nThis misfortune, which was to cost the Japanese so dear, may perhaps be\r\nattributed at least in part to the continental influences under which their\r\narmy had been trained. We at least can trace the unlimited outlook in the\r\npages of the German Staff history. In dealing with the Japanese plan of\r\noperations it is assumed that the occupation of Korea and the isolation of\r\nPort Arthur were but preliminaries to a concentric advance on Liao-yang,\r\n\"which was kept in view as the first objective of the operations on land.\"\r\nBut surely on every theory of the war the first objective of the Japanese\r\non land was Seoul, where they expected to have to fight their first\r\nimportant action against troops advancing from the Yalu; and surely their\r\nsecond was Port Arthur, with its fleet and arsenal, which they expected to\r\nreduce with little more difficulty than they had met with ten years before\r\nagainst the Chinese. Such at least was the actual progression of events,\r\nand a criticism which regards operations of such magnitude and ultimate\r\nimportance as mere incidents of strategic deployment is only to be\r\nexplained by the domination of the Napoleonic idea of war, against the\r\nuniversal application of which Clausewitz so solemnly protested. It is the\r\nwork of men who have a natural difficulty in conceiving a war plan that\r\ndoes not culminate in a Jena or a Sedan. It is a view surely which is the\r\nchild of theory, bearing no relation to the actuality of the war in\r\nquestion and affording no explanation of its ultimate success. The truth\r\nis, that so long as the Japanese acted on the principles of limited war, as\r\nlaid down by Clausewitz and Jomini and plainly deducible from our own rich\r\nexperience, they progressed beyond all their expectations, but so soon as\r\nthey departed from them and suffered themselves to be confused with\r\ncontinental theories they were surprised by unaccountable failure.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"Limited war\" is no doubt not entirely happy. Yet no other\r\nhas been found to condense the ideas of limited object and limited\r\ninterest, which are its special characteristics. Still if the above example\r\nbe kept in mind as a typical case, the meaning of the term will not be\r\nmistaken. It only remains to emphasise one important point. The fact that\r\nthe doctrine of limited war traverses the current belief that our primary\r\nobjective must always be the enemy's armed forces is liable to carry with\r\nit a false inference that it also rejects the corollary that war means the\r\nuse of battles. Nothing is further from the conception. Whatever the form\r\nof war, there is no likelihood of our ever going back to the old fallacy of\r\nattempting to decide wars by manoeuvres. All forms alike demand the use of\r\nbattles. By our fundamental theory war is always \"a continuation of\r\npolitical intercourse, in which fighting is substituted for writing notes.\"\r\nHowever great the controlling influence of the political object, it must\r\nnever obscure the fact that it is by fighting we have to gain our end.\r\n\r\nIt is the more necessary to insist on this point, for the idea of making a\r\npiece of territory your object is liable to be confused with the older\r\nmethod of conducting war, in which armies were content to manoeuvre for\r\nstrategical positions, and a battle came almost to be regarded as a mark of\r\nbad generalship. With such parading limited war has nothing to do. Its\r\nconduct differs only from that of unlimited war in that instead of having\r\nto destroy our enemy's whole power of resistance, we need only overthrow so\r\nmuch of his active force as he is able or willing to bring to bear in order\r\nto prevent or terminate our occupation of the territorial object.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration, then, in entering on such a war is to endeavour to\r\ndetermine what the force will amount to. It will depend, firstly, on the\r\nimportance the enemy attaches to the limited object, coupled with the\r\nnature and extent of his preoccupations elsewhere, and, secondly, it will\r\ndepend upon the natural difficulties of his lines of communication and the\r\nextent to which we can increase those difficulties by our conduct of the\r\ninitial operations. In favourable circumstances therefore (and here lies\r\nthe great value of the limited form) we are able to control the amount of\r\nforce we shall have to encounter. The most favourable circumstances and the\r\nonly circumstances by which we ourselves can profit are such as permit the\r\nmore or less complete isolation of the object by naval action, and such\r\nisolation can never be established until we have entirely overthrown the\r\nenemy's naval forces.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we enter the field of naval strategy. We can now leave behind\r\nus the theory of war in general and, in order to pave the way to our final\r\nconclusions, devote our attention to the theory of naval warfare in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    PART TWO\r\n\r\n              THEORY OF NAVAL WAR\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n             THEORY OF THE OBJECT--\r\n               COMMAND OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe object of naval warfare must always be directly or indirectly either to\r\nsecure the command of the sea or to prevent the enemy from securing it.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the proposition should be noted with special care in\r\norder to exclude a habit of thought, which is one of the commonest sources\r\nof error in naval speculation. That error is the very general assumption\r\nthat if one belligerent loses the command of the sea it passes at once to\r\nthe other belligerent. The most cursory study of naval history is enough to\r\nreveal the falseness of such an assumption. It tells us that the most\r\ncommon situation in naval war is that neither side has the command; that\r\nthe normal position is not a commanded sea, but an uncommanded sea. The\r\nmere assertion, which no one denies, that the object of naval warfare is to\r\nget command of the sea actually connotes the proposition that the command\r\nis normally in dispute. It is this state of dispute with which naval\r\nstrategy is most nearly concerned, for when the command is lost or won pure\r\nnaval strategy comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThis truth is so obvious that it would scarcely be worth mentioning were it\r\nnot for the constant recurrence of such phrases as: \"If England were to\r\nlose command of the sea, it would be all over with her.\" The fallacy of the\r\nidea is that it ignores the power of the strategical defensive. It assumes\r\nthat if in the face of some extraordinary hostile coalition or through some\r\nextraordinary mischance we found ourselves without sufficient strength to\r\nkeep the command, we should therefore be too weak to prevent the enemy\r\ngetting it--a negation of the whole theory of war, which at least requires\r\nfurther support than it ever receives.\r\n\r\nAnd not only is this assumption a negation of theory; it is a negation both\r\nof practical experience and of the expressed opinion of our greatest\r\nmasters. We ourselves have used the defensive at sea with success, as under\r\nWilliam the Third and in the War of American Independence, while in our\r\nlong wars with France she habitually used it in such a way that sometimes\r\nfor years, though we had a substantial preponderance, we could not get\r\ncommand, and for years were unable to carry out our war plan without\r\nserious interruption from her fleet.\r\n\r\nSo far from the defensive being a negligible factor at sea, or even the\r\nmere pestilent heresy it is generally represented, it is of course inherent\r\nin all war, and, as we have seen, the paramount questions of strategy both\r\nat sea and on land turn on the relative possibilities of offensive and\r\ndefensive, and upon the relative proportions in which each should enter\r\ninto our plan of war. At sea the most powerful and aggressively-minded\r\nbelligerent can no more avoid his alternating periods of defence, which\r\nresult from inevitable arrests of offensive action, than they can be\r\navoided on land. The defensive, then, has to be considered; but before we\r\nare in a position to do so with profit, we have to proceed with our\r\nanalysis of the phrase, \"Command of the Sea,\" and ascertain exactly what it\r\nis we mean by it in war.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, \"Command of the Sea\" is not identical in its\r\nstrategical conditions with the conquest of territory. You cannot argue\r\nfrom the one to the other, as has been too commonly done. Such phrases as\r\nthe \"Conquest of water territory\" and \"Making the enemy's coast our\r\nfrontier\" had their use and meaning in the mouths of those who framed them,\r\nbut they are really little but rhetorical expressions founded on false\r\nanalogy, and false analogy is not a secure basis for a theory of war.\r\n\r\nThe analogy is false for two reasons, both of which enter materially into\r\nthe conduct of naval war. You cannot conquer sea because it is not\r\nsusceptible of ownership, at least outside territorial waters. You cannot,\r\nas lawyers say, \"reduce it into possession,\" because you cannot exclude\r\nneutrals from it as you can from territory you conquer. In the second\r\nplace, you cannot subsist your armed force upon it as you can upon enemy's\r\nterritory. Clearly, then, to make deductions from an assumption that\r\ncommand of the sea is analogous to conquest of territory is unscientific,\r\nand certain to lead to error.\r\n\r\nThe only safe method is to inquire what it is we can secure for ourselves,\r\nand what it is we can deny the enemy by command of the sea. Now, if we\r\nexclude fishery rights, which are irrelevant to the present matter, the\r\nonly right we or our enemy can have on the sea is the right of passage; in\r\nother words, the only positive value which the high seas have for national\r\nlife is as a means of communication. For the active life of a nation such\r\nmeans may stand for much or it may stand for little, but to every maritime\r\nState it has some value. Consequently by denying an enemy this means of\r\npassage we check the movement of his national life at sea in the same kind\r\nof way that we check it on land by occupying his territory. So far the\r\nanalogy holds good, but no further.\r\n\r\nSo much for the positive value which the sea has in national life. It has\r\nalso a negative value. For not only is it a means of communication, but,\r\nunlike the means of communication ashore, it is also a barrier. By winning\r\ncommand of the sea we remove that barrier from our own path, thereby\r\nplacing ourselves in position to exert direct military pressure upon the\r\nnational life of our enemy ashore, while at the same time we solidify it\r\nagainst him and prevent his exerting direct military pressure upon\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nCommand of the sea, therefore, means nothing but the control of maritime\r\ncommunications, whether for commercial or military purposes. The object of\r\nnaval warfare is the control of communications, and not, as in land\r\nwarfare, the conquest of territory. The difference is fundamental. True, it\r\nis rightly said that strategy ashore is mainly a question of\r\ncommunications, but they are communications in another sense. The phrase\r\nrefers to the communications of the army alone, and not to the wider\r\ncommunications which are part of the life of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut on land also there are communications of a kind which are essential to\r\nnational life--the internal communications which connect the points of\r\ndistribution. Here again we touch an analogy between the two kinds of war.\r\nLand warfare, as the most devoted adherents of the modern view admit,\r\ncannot attain its end by military victories alone. The destruction of your\r\nenemy's forces will not avail for certain unless you have in reserve\r\nsufficient force to complete the occupation of his inland communications\r\nand principal points of distribution. This power is the real fruit of\r\nvictory, the power to strangle the whole national life. It is not until\r\nthis is done that a high-spirited nation, whose whole heart is in the war,\r\nwill consent to make peace and do your will. It is precisely in the same\r\nway that the command of the sea works towards peace, though of course in a\r\nfar less coercive manner, against a continental State. By occupying her\r\nmaritime communications and closing the points of distribution in which\r\nthey terminate we destroy the national life afloat, and thereby check the\r\nvitality of that life ashore so far as the one is dependent on the other.\r\nThus we see that so long as we retain the power and right to stop maritime\r\ncommunications, the analogy between command of the sea and the conquest of\r\nterritory is in this aspect very close. And the analogy is of the utmost\r\npractical importance, for on it turns the most burning question of maritime\r\nwar, which it will be well to deal with in this place.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if the object and end of naval warfare is the control of\r\ncommunications it must carry with it the right to forbid, if we can, the\r\npassage of both public and private property upon the sea. Now the only\r\nmeans we have of enforcing such control of commercial communications at sea\r\nis in the last resort the capture or destruction of sea-borne property.\r\nSuch capture or destruction is the penalty which we impose upon our enemy\r\nfor attempting to use the communications of which he does not hold the\r\ncontrol. In the language of jurisprudence, it is the ultimate sanction of\r\nthe interdict which we are seeking to enforce. The current term \"Commerce\r\ndestruction\" is not in fact a logical expression of the strategical idea.\r\nTo make the position clear we should say \"Commerce prevention.\"\r\n\r\nThe methods of this \"Commerce prevention\" have no more connection with the\r\nold and barbarous idea of plunder and reprisal than orderly requisitions\r\nashore have with the old idea of plunder and ravaging. No form of war\r\nindeed causes so little human suffering as the capture of property at sea.\r\nIt is more akin to process of law, such as distress for rent, or execution\r\nof judgment, or arrest of a ship, than to a military operation. Once, it is\r\ntrue, it was not so. In the days of privateers it was accompanied too\r\noften, and particularly in the Mediterranean and the West Indies, with\r\nlamentable cruelty and lawlessness, and the existence of such abuses was\r\nthe real reason for the general agreement to the Declaration of Paris by\r\nwhich privateering was abolished.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the only reason. The idea of privateering was a survival of\r\na primitive and unscientific conception of war, which was governed mainly\r\nby a general notion of doing your enemy as much damage as possible and\r\nmaking reprisal for wrongs he had done you. To the same class of ideas\r\nbelonged the practice of plunder and ravaging ashore. But neither of these\r\nmethods of war was abolished for humanitarian reasons. They disappeared\r\nindeed as a general practice before the world had begun to talk of\r\nhumanity. They were abolished because war became more scientific. The right\r\nto plunder and ravage was not denied. But plunder was found to demoralise\r\nyour troops and unfit them for fighting, and ravaging proved to be a less\r\npowerful means of coercing your enemy than exploiting the occupied country\r\nby means of regular requisitions for the supply of your own army and the\r\nincrease of its offensive range. In short, the reform arose from a desire\r\nto husband your enemy's resources for your own use instead of wantonly\r\nwasting them.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way privateering always had a debilitating effect upon our own\r\nregular force. It greatly increased the difficulty of manning the navy, and\r\nthe occasional large profits had a demoralising influence on detached\r\ncruiser commanders. It tended to keep alive the mediaeval corsair spirit at\r\nthe expense of the modern military spirit which made for direct operations\r\nagainst the enemy's armed forces. It was inevitable that as the new\r\nmovement of opinion gathered force it should carry with it a conviction\r\nthat for operating against sea-borne trade sporadic attack could never be\r\nso efficient as an organised system of operations to secure a real\r\nstrategical control of the enemy's maritime communications. A riper and\r\nsounder view of war revealed that what may be called tactical commercial\r\nblockade--that is, the blockade of ports--could be extended to and\r\nsupplemented by a strategical blockade of the great trade routes. In moral\r\nprinciple there is no difference between the two. Admit the principle of\r\ntactical or close blockade, and as between belligerents you cannot condemn\r\nthe principle of strategical or distant blockade. Except in their effect\r\nupon neutrals, there is no juridical difference between the two.\r\n\r\nWhy indeed should this humane yet drastic process of war be rejected at sea\r\nif the same thing is permitted on land? If on land you allow contributions\r\nand requisitions, if you permit the occupation of towns, ports, and inland\r\ncommunications, without which no conquest is complete and no effective war\r\npossible, why should you refuse similar procedure at sea where it causes\r\nfar less individual suffering? If you refuse the right of controlling\r\ncommunications at sea, you must also refuse the right on land. If you admit\r\nthe right of contributions on land, you must admit the right of capture at\r\nsea. Otherwise you will permit to military Powers the extreme rights of war\r\nand leave to the maritime Powers no effective rights at all. Their ultimate\r\nargument would be gone.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the idea of abolishing private capture at sea is humanitarian,\r\nand in so far as it rests on a belief that it would strengthen our position\r\nas a commercial maritime State, let it be honourably dealt with. But so far\r\nas its advocates have as yet expressed themselves, the proposal appears to\r\nbe based on two fallacies. One is, that you can avoid attack by depriving\r\nyourself of the power of offence and resting on defence alone, and the\r\nother, the idea that war consists entirely of battles between armies or\r\nfleets. It ignores the fundamental fact that battles are only the means of\r\nenabling you to do that which really brings wars to an end-that is, to\r\nexert pressure on the citizens and their collective life. \"After shattering\r\nthe hostile main army,\" says Von der Goltz, \"we still have the forcing of a\r\npeace as a separate and, in certain circumstances, a more difficult task\r\n... to make the enemy's country feel the burdens of war with such weight\r\nthat the desire for peace will prevail. This is the point in which Napoleon\r\nfailed.... It may be necessary to seize the harbours, commercial centres,\r\nimportant lines of traffic, fortifications and arsenals, in other words,\r\nall important property necessary to the existence of the people and army.\"\r\n\r\nIf, then, we are deprived of the right to use analogous means at sea, the\r\nobject for which we fight battles almost ceases to exist. Defeat the\r\nenemy's fleets as we may, he will be but little the worse. We shall have\r\nopened the way for invasion, but any of the great continental Powers can\r\nlaugh at our attempts to invade single-handed. If we cannot reap the\r\nharvest of our success by deadening his national activities at sea, the\r\nonly legitimate means of pressure within our strength will be denied us.\r\nOur fleet, if it would proceed with such secondary operations as are\r\nessential for forcing a peace, will be driven to such barbarous expedients\r\nas the bombardment of seaport towns and destructive raids upon the hostile\r\ncoasts.\r\n\r\nIf the means of pressure which follow successful fighting were abolished\r\nboth on land and sea there would be this argument in favour of the change,\r\nthat it would mean perhaps for civilised States the entire cessation of\r\nwar; for war would become so impotent, that no one would care to engage in\r\nit. It would be an affair between regular armies and fleets, with which the\r\npeople had little concern. International quarrels would tend to take the\r\nform of the mediaeval private disputes which were settled by champions in\r\ntrial by battle, an absurdity which led rapidly to the domination of purely\r\nlegal procedure. If international quarrels could go the same way, humanity\r\nwould have advanced a long stride. But the world is scarcely ripe for such\r\na revolution. Meanwhile to abolish the right of interference with the flow\r\nof private property at sea without abolishing the corresponding right\r\nashore would only defeat the ends of humanitarians. The great deterrent,\r\nthe most powerful check on war, would be gone. It is commerce and finance\r\nwhich now more than ever control or check the foreign policy of nations. If\r\ncommerce and finance stand to lose by war, their influence for a peaceful\r\nsolution will be great; and so long as the right of private capture at sea\r\nexists, they stand to lose in every maritime war immediately and inevitably\r\nwhatever the ultimate result may be. Abolish the right, and this deterrent\r\ndisappears; nay, they will even stand to win immediate gains owing to the\r\nsudden expansion of Government expenditure which the hostilities will\r\nentail, and the expansion of sea commerce which the needs of the armed\r\nforces will create. Any such losses as maritime warfare under existing\r\nconditions must immediately inflict will be remote if interference with\r\nproperty is confined to the land. They will never indeed be serious except\r\nin the case of complete defeat, and no one enters upon war expecting\r\ndefeat. It is in the hope of victory and gain that aggressive wars are\r\nborn. The fear of quick and certain loss is their surest preventive.\r\nHumanity, then, will surely beware how in a too hasty pursuit of peaceful\r\nideals it lets drop the best weapon it has for scotching the evil it has as\r\nyet no power to kill.\r\n\r\nIn what follows, therefore, it is intended to regard the right of private\r\ncapture at sea as still subsisting. Without it, indeed, naval warfare is\r\nalmost inconceivable, and in any case no one has any experience of such a\r\ntruncated method of war on which profitable study can be founded.\r\n\r\nThe primary method, then, in which we use victory or preponderance at sea\r\nand bring it to bear on the enemy's population to secure peace, is by the\r\ncapture or destruction of the enemy's property, whether public or private.\r\nBut in comparing the process with the analogous occupation of territory and\r\nthe levying of contributions and requisitions we have to observe a marked\r\ndifference. Both processes are what may be called economic pressure. But\r\nashore the economic pressure can only be exerted as the consequence of\r\nvictory or acquired domination by military success. At sea the process\r\nbegins at once. Indeed, more often than not, the first act of hostility in\r\nmaritime wars has been the capture of private property at sea. In a sense\r\nthis is also true ashore. The first step of an invader after crossing the\r\nfrontier will be to control to a less or greater extent such private\r\nproperty as he is able to use for his purposes. But such interference with\r\nprivate property is essentially a military act, and does not belong to the\r\nsecondary phase of economic pressure. At sea it does, and the reason why\r\nthis should be so lies in certain fundamental differences between land and\r\nsea warfare which are implicit in the communication theory of naval war.\r\n\r\nTo elucidate the point, it must be repeated that maritime communications,\r\nwhich are the root of the idea of command of the sea, are not analogous to\r\nmilitary communications in the ordinary use of the term. Military\r\ncommunications refer solely to the army's lines of supply and retreat.\r\nMaritime communications have a wider meaning. Though in effect embracing\r\nthe lines of fleet supply, they correspond in strategical values not to\r\nmilitary lines of supply, but to those internal lines of communication by\r\nwhich the flow of national life is maintained ashore. Consequently maritime\r\ncommunications are on a wholly different footing from land communications.\r\nAt sea the communications are, for the most part, common to both\r\nbelligerents, whereas ashore each possesses his own in his own territory.\r\nThe strategical effect is of far-reaching importance, for it means that at\r\nsea strategical offence and defence tend to merge in a way that is unknown\r\nashore. Since maritime communications are common, we as a rule cannot\r\nattack those of the enemy without defending our own. In military operations\r\nthe converse is the rule. Normally, an attack on our enemy's communications\r\ntends to expose their own.\r\n\r\nThe theory of common communications will become clear by taking an example.\r\nIn our wars with France our communications with the Mediterranean, India,\r\nand America ran down from the Channel mouth past Finisterre and St.\r\nVincent; and those of France, at least from her Atlantic ports, were\r\nidentical for almost their entire distance. In our wars with the Dutch the\r\nidentity was even closer. Even in the case of Spain, her great trade routes\r\nfollowed the same lines as our own for the greater part of their extent.\r\nConsequently the opening moves which we generally made to defend our trade\r\nby the occupation of those lines placed us in a position to attack our\r\nenemy's trade. The same situation arose even when our opening dispositions\r\nwere designed as defence against home invasion or against attacks upon our\r\ncolonies, for the positions our fleet had to take up to those ends always\r\nlay on or about the terminal and focal points of trade routes. Whether our\r\nimmediate object were to bring the enemy's main fleets to action or to\r\nexercise economic pressure, it made but little difference. If the enemy\r\nwere equally anxious to engage, it was at one of the terminal or focal\r\nareas we were almost certain to get contact. If he wished to avoid a\r\ndecision, the best way to force him to action was to occupy his trade\r\nroutes at the same vital points.\r\n\r\nThus it comes about that, whereas on land the process of economic pressure,\r\nat least in the modern conception of war, should only begin after decisive\r\nvictory, at sea it starts automatically from the first. Indeed such\r\npressure may be the only means of forcing the decision we seek, as will\r\nappear more clearly when we come to deal with the other fundamental\r\ndifference between land and sea warfare.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we may note that at sea the use of economic pressure from the\r\ncommencement is justified for two reasons. The first is, as we have seen,\r\nthat it is an economy of means to use our defensive positions for attack\r\nwhen attack does not vitiate those positions, and it will not vitiate them\r\nif fleet cruisers operate with restraint. The second is, that interference\r\nwith the enemy's trade has two aspects. It is not only a means of exerting\r\nthe secondary economic pressure, it is also a primary means towards\r\noverthrowing the enemy's power of resistance. Wars are not decided\r\nexclusively by military and naval force. Finance is scarcely less\r\nimportant. When other things are equal, it is the longer purse that wins.\r\nIt has even many times redressed an unfavourable balance of armed force and\r\ngiven victory to the physically weaker Power. Anything, therefore, which we\r\nare able to achieve towards crippling our enemy's finance is a direct step\r\nto his overthrow, and the most effective means we can employ to this end\r\nagainst a maritime State is to deny him the resources of seaborne trade.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that in naval warfare, however closely we may\r\nconcentrate our efforts on the destruction of our enemy's armed forces as\r\nthe direct means to his overthrow, it would be folly to stay our hands when\r\nopportunities occur, as they will automatically, for undermining his\r\nfinancial position on which the continued vigour of those armed forces so\r\nlargely depends. Thus the occupation of our enemy's sea communications and\r\nthe confiscatory operations it connotes are in a sense primary operations,\r\nand not, as on land, secondary.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the abstract conclusions at which we arrive in our attempt\r\nto analyse the idea of command of the sea and to give it precision as the\r\ncontrol of common communications. Their concrete value will appear when we\r\ncome to deal with the various forms which naval operations may take, such\r\nas, \"seeking out the enemy's fleet,\" blockade, attack and defence of trade,\r\nand the safeguarding of combined expeditions. For the present it remains to\r\ndeal with the various kinds of sea command which flow from the\r\ncommunication idea.\r\n\r\nIf the object of the command of the sea is to control communications, it is\r\nobvious it may exist in various degrees. We may be able to control the\r\nwhole of the common communications as the result either of great initial\r\npreponderance or of decisive victory. If we are not sufficiently strong to\r\ndo this, we may still be able to control some of the communications; that\r\nis, our control may be general or local. Obvious as the point is, it needs\r\nemphasising, because of a maxim that has become current that \"the sea is\r\nall one.\" Like other maxims of the kind, it conveys a truth with a trail of\r\nerror in its wake. The truth it contains seems to be simply this, that as a\r\nrule local control can only avail us temporarily, for so long as the enemy\r\nhas a sufficient fleet anywhere, it is theoretically in his power to\r\noverthrow our control of any special sea area.\r\n\r\nIt amounts indeed to little more than a rhetorical expression, used to\r\nemphasise the high mobility of fleets as contrasted with that of armies and\r\nthe absence of physical obstacles to restrict that mobility. That this\r\nvital feature of naval warfare should be consecrated in a maxim is well,\r\nbut when it is caricatured into a doctrine, as it sometimes is, that you\r\ncannot move a battalion oversea till you have entirely overthrown your\r\nenemy's fleet, it deserves gibbeting. It would be as wise to hold that in\r\nwar you must never risk anything.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to have been the evil influence of this travestied maxim\r\nwhich had much to do with the cramped and timorous strategy of the\r\nAmericans in their late war with Spain. They had ample naval force to\r\nsecure such a local and temporary command of the Gulf of Mexico as to have\r\njustified them at once in throwing all the troops they had ready into Cuba\r\nto support the insurgents, in accordance with their war plan. They had also\r\nsufficient strength to ensure that the communications with the\r\nexpeditionary force could not be interrupted permanently. And yet, because\r\nthe Spaniards had an undefeated fleet at sea somewhere, they hesitated, and\r\nwere nearly lost. The Japanese had no such illusions. Without having struck\r\na naval blow of any kind, and with a hostile fleet actually within the\r\ntheatre of operations, they started their essential military movement\r\noversea, content that though they might not be able to secure the control\r\nof the line of passage, they were in a position to deny effective control\r\nto the enemy. Our own history is full of such operations. There are cases\r\nin plenty where the results promised by a successful military blow oversea,\r\nbefore permanent command had been obtained, were great enough to justify a\r\nrisk which, like the Japanese, we knew how to minimise by judicious use of\r\nour favourable geographical position, and of a certain system of\r\nprotection, which must be dealt with later.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose, then, of framing a plan of war or campaign, it must be\r\ntaken that command may exist in various states or degrees, each of which\r\nhas its special possibilities and limitations. It may be general or local,\r\nand it may be permanent or temporary. General command may be permanent or\r\ntemporary, but mere local command, except in very favourable geographical\r\nconditions, should scarcely ever be regarded as more than temporary, since\r\nnormally it is always liable to interruption from other theatres so long as\r\nthe enemy possesses an effective naval force.\r\n\r\nFinally, it has to be noted that even permanent general command can never\r\nin practice be absolute. No degree of naval superiority can ensure our\r\ncommunications against sporadic attack from detached cruisers, or even\r\nraiding squadrons if they be boldly led and are prepared to risk\r\ndestruction. Even after Hawke's decisive victory at Quiberon had completed\r\nthe overthrow of the enemy's sea forces, a British transport was captured\r\nbetween Cork and Portsmouth, and an Indiaman in sight of the Lizard, while\r\nWellington's complaints in the Peninsula of the insecurity of his\r\ncommunications are well known.[9] By general and permanent control we do\r\nnot mean that the enemy can do nothing, but that he cannot interfere with\r\nour maritime trade and oversea operations so seriously as to affect the\r\nissue of the war, and that he cannot carry on his own trade and operations\r\nexcept at such risk and hazard as to remove them from the field of\r\npractical strategy. In other words, it means that the enemy can no longer\r\nattack our lines of passage and communication effectively, and that he\r\ncannot use or defend his own.\r\n\r\n  [9] In justice to Wellington, it should be said that his complaints were\r\n  due to false reports that exaggerated a couple of insignificant captures\r\n  into a serious interruption.\r\n\r\nTo complete our equipment for appreciating any situation for which\r\noperations have to be designed, it is necessary to remember that when the\r\ncommand is in dispute the general conditions may give a stable or an\r\nunstable equilibrium. It may be that the power of neither side\r\npreponderates to any appreciable extent. It may also be that the\r\npreponderance is with ourselves, or it may be that it lies with the enemy.\r\nSuch preponderance of course will not depend entirely on actual relative\r\nstrength, either physical or moral, but will be influenced by the\r\ninter-relation of naval positions and the comparative convenience of their\r\nsituation in regard to the object of the war or campaign. By naval\r\npositions we mean, firstly, naval bases and, secondly, the terminals of the\r\ngreater lines of communication or trade-routes and the focal areas where\r\nthey tend to converge, as at Finisterre, Gibraltar, Suez, the Cape,\r\nSingapore, and many others.\r\n\r\nUpon the degree and distribution of this preponderance will depend in a\r\ngeneral way the extent to which our plans will be governed by the idea of\r\ndefence or offence. Generally speaking, it will be to the advantage of the\r\npreponderating side to seek a decision as quickly as possible in order to\r\nterminate the state of dispute. Conversely, the weaker side will as a rule\r\nseek to avoid or postpone a decision in hope of being able by minor\r\noperations, the chances of war, or the development of fresh strength, to\r\nturn the balance in its favour. Such was the line which France adopted\r\nfrequently in her wars with us, sometimes legitimately, but sometimes to\r\nsuch an excess as seriously to demoralise her fleet. Her experience has led\r\nto a hasty deduction that the defensive at sea for even a weaker Power is\r\nan unmixed evil. Such a conclusion is foreign to the fundamental principles\r\nof war. It is idle to exclude the use of an expectant attitude because in\r\nitself it cannot lead to final success, and because if used to excess it\r\nends in demoralisation and the loss of will to attack. The misconception\r\nappears to have arisen from insistence on the drawbacks of defence by\r\nwriters seeking to persuade their country to prepare in time of peace\r\nsufficient naval strength to justify offence from the outset.\r\n\r\nHaving now determined the fundamental principles which underlie the idea of\r\nCommand of the Sea, we are in a position to consider the manner in which\r\nfleets are constituted in order to fit them for their task.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n             THEORY OF THE MEANS--\r\n          THE CONSTITUTION OF FLEETS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn all eras of naval warfare fighting ships have exhibited a tendency to\r\ndifferentiate into groups in accordance with the primary function each\r\nclass was designed to serve. These groupings or classifications are what is\r\nmeant by the constitution of a fleet. A threefold differentiation into\r\nbattleships, cruisers, and flotilla has so long dominated naval thought\r\nthat we have come to regard it as normal, and even essential. It may be so,\r\nbut such a classification has been by no means constant. Other ideas of\r\nfleet constitution have not only existed, but have stood the test of war\r\nfor long periods, and it is unscientific and unsafe to ignore such facts if\r\nwe wish to arrive at sound doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the classes of ships which constitute a fleet are, or\r\nought to be, the expression in material of the strategical and tactical\r\nideas that prevail at any given time, and consequently they have varied not\r\nonly with the ideas, but also with the material in vogue. It may also be\r\nsaid more broadly that they have varied with the theory of war, by which\r\nmore or less consciously naval thought was dominated. It is true that few\r\nages have formulated a theory of war, or even been clearly aware of its\r\ninfluence; but nevertheless such theories have always existed, and even in\r\ntheir most nebulous and intangible shapes seem to have exerted an\r\nascertainable influence on the constitution of fleets.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the dawn of modern times, we note that at the opening of the\r\nsixteenth century, when galley warfare reached its culmination, the\r\nconstitution was threefold, bearing a superficial analogy to that which we\r\nhave come to regard as normal. There were the galeasses and heavy galleys\r\ncorresponding to our battleships, light galleys corresponding to our\r\ncruisers, while the flotilla was represented by the small \"frigates,\"\r\n\"brigantines,\" and similar craft, which had no slave gang for propulsion,\r\nbut were rowed by the fighting crew. Such armed sailing ships as then\r\nexisted were regarded as auxiliaries, and formed a category apart, as\r\nfireships and bomb-vessels did in the sailing period, and as mine-layers do\r\nnow. But the parallel must not be overstrained. The distinction of function\r\nbetween the two classes of galleys was not so strongly marked as that\r\nbetween the lighter craft and the galleys; that is to say, the scientific\r\ndifferentiation between battleships and cruisers had not yet been so firmly\r\ndeveloped as it was destined to become in later times, and the smaller\r\ngalleys habitually took their place in the fighting line.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of the sailing vessel as the typical ship-of-war an entirely\r\nnew constitution made its appearance. The dominating classification became\r\ntwofold. It was a classification into vessels of subservient movement using\r\nsails, and vessels of free movement using oars. It was on these lines that\r\nour true Royal Navy was first organised by Henry the Eighth, an expert who,\r\nin the science of war, was one of the most advanced masters in Europe. In\r\nthis constitution there appears even less conception than in that of the\r\ngalley period of a radical distinction between battleships and cruisers. As\r\nHenry's fleet was originally designed, practically the whole of the\r\nbattleships were sailing vessels, though it is true that when the French\r\nbrought up galleys from the Mediterranean, he gave some of the smartest of\r\nthem oars. The constitution was in fact one of battleships and flotilla. Of\r\ncruisers there were none as we understand them. Fleet scouting was done by\r\nthe \"Row-barges\" and newly introduced \"Pinnaces\" of the flotilla, while as\r\nfor commerce protection, merchant vessels had usually to look after\r\nthemselves, the larger ones being regularly armed for their own defence.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this twofold constitution continued long after the\r\nconditions of its origin had passed away. In ever-lessening degree indeed\r\nit may be said to have lasted for two hundred years. During the Dutch wars\r\nof the seventeenth century, which finally established the dominant status\r\nof the sailing warship, practically all true sailing vessels--that is,\r\nvessels that had no auxiliary oar propulsion--took station in the line. The\r\n\"Frigates\" of that time differed not at all from the \"Great Ship\" in their\r\nfunctions, but only in their design. By the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, however, the old tendency to a threefold organisation began to\r\nreassert itself, but it was not till the middle of the century that the\r\nprocess of development can be regarded as complete.\r\n\r\nDown to the end of the War of the Austrian Succession--a period which is\r\nusually deemed to be one of conspicuous depression in the naval art--the\r\nclassification of our larger sailing vessels was purely arbitrary. The\r\n\"Rates\" (which had been introduced during the Dutch wars) bore no relation\r\nto any philosophical conception of the complex duties of a fleet. In the\r\nfirst rate were 100-gun ships; in the second, 90-gun ships--all\r\nthree-deckers. So far the system of rating was sound enough, but when we\r\ncome to the third rate we find it includes 80-gun ships, which were also of\r\nthree decks, while the bulk of the rest were 70-gun two-deckers. The fourth\r\nrate was also composed of two-decked ships--weak battle-units of 60 and 50\r\nguns--and this was far the largest class. All these four rates were classed\r\nas ships-of-the-line. Below them came the fifth rates, which, though they\r\nwere used as cruisers, had no distinct class name. They differed indeed\r\nonly in degree from the ship-of-the-line, being all cramped two-deckers of\r\n44 and 40 guns, and they must be regarded, in so far as they expressed any\r\nlogical idea of naval warfare, as the forerunners of the \"Intermediate\"\r\nclass, represented in the succeeding epochs by 50-gun ships, and in our own\r\ntime by armoured cruisers. The only true cruiser is found in the sixth\r\nrate, which comprised small and weakly armed 20-gun ships, and between them\r\nand the \"Forties\" there was nothing. Below them, but again without any\r\nclear differentiation, came the unrated sloops representing the flotilla.\r\n\r\nIn such a system of rating there is no logical distinction either between\r\nlarge and small battleships or between battleships and cruisers, or between\r\ncruisers and flotilla. The only marked break in the gradual descent is that\r\nbetween the 40-gun two-deckers and the 20-gun cruisers. As these latter\r\nvessels as well as the sloops used sweeps for auxiliary propulsion, we are\r\nforced to conclude that the only basis of the classification was that\r\nadopted by Henry the Eighth, which, sound as it was in his time, had long\r\nceased to have any real relation to the actuality of naval war.\r\n\r\nIt was not till Anson's memorable administration that a scientific system\r\nof rating was re-established and the fleet at last assumed the logical\r\nconstitution which it retained up to our own time. In the first two rates\r\nappear the fleet flagship class, three-deckers of 100 and 90 guns\r\nrespectively. All smaller three-deckers are eliminated. In the next two\r\nrates we have the rank and file of the battle-line, two-deckers of\r\nincreased size-namely, seventy-fours in the third rate, and sixty-fours in\r\nthe fourth. Here, however, is a slight break in the perfection of the\r\nsystem, for the fourth rate also included 50-gun ships of two decks, which,\r\nduring the progress of the Seven Years' War, ceased to be regarded as\r\nships-of-the-line. War experience was eliminating small battleships, and\r\ntherewith it called for a type intermediate between battleships and\r\ncruisers, with whose functions we shall have to deal directly. In practice\r\nthese units soon formed a rate by themselves, into which, by the same\r\ntendency, 60-gun ships were destined to sink half a century later.\r\n\r\nBut most pregnant of all Anson's reforms was the introduction of the true\r\ncruiser, no longer a small battleship, but a vessel specialised for its\r\nlogical functions, and distinct in design both from the battle rates and\r\nthe flotilla. Both 40-gun and 20-gun types were abolished, and in their\r\nplace appear two cruiser rates, and the fifth consisting of 32-gun true\r\nfrigates, and the sixth of 28-gun frigates, both completely divorced from\r\nany battle function. Finally, after a very distinct gap, came the unrated\r\nsloops and smaller craft, which formed the flotilla for coastwise and\r\ninshore work, despatch service, and kindred duties.\r\n\r\nThe reforms of the great First Lord amounted in fact to a clearly\r\napprehended threefold constitution, in which the various groups were\r\nfrankly specialised in accordance with the functions each was expected to\r\nperform. Specialisation, it will be observed, is the note of the process of\r\ndevelopment. We have no longer an endeavour to adapt the fleet to its\r\nmultifarious duties by multiplying a comparatively weak nature of\r\nfighting-ship, which could act in the line and yet be had in sufficient\r\nnumbers to protect commerce, but which was not well fitted for either\r\nservice. Instead we note a definite recognition of the principle that\r\nbattleships should be as powerful as possible, and that in order to permit\r\nof their due development they must be relieved of their cruising functions\r\nby a class of vessel specially adapted for the purpose. The question we\r\nhave to consider is, was this specialisation, which has asserted itself\r\ndown to our own times, in the true line of development? Was it, in fact, a\r\nright expression of the needs which are indicated by the theory of naval\r\nwar?\r\n\r\nBy the theory of naval war it must be reiterated we mean nothing but an\r\nenunciation of the fundamental principles which underlie all naval war.\r\nThose principles, if we have determined them correctly, should be found\r\ngiving shape not only to strategy and tactics, but also to material,\r\nwhatever method and means of naval warfare may be in use at any given time.\r\nConversely, if we find strategy, tactics, or organisation exhibiting a\r\ntendency to reproduce the same forms under widely differing conditions of\r\nmethod and material, we should be able to show that those forms bear a\r\nconstant and definite relation to the principles which our theory\r\nendeavours to express.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Anson's threefold organisation, the relation is not far to\r\nseek, though it has become obscured by two maxims. The one is, that \"the\r\ncommand of the sea depends upon battleships,\" and the other, that \"cruisers\r\nare the eyes of the fleet.\" It is the inherent evil of maxims that they\r\ntend to get stretched beyond their original meaning. Both of these express\r\na truth, but neither expresses the whole truth. On no theory of naval\r\nwarfare can we expect to command the sea with battleships, nor, on the\r\ncommunication theory, can we regard the primary function of cruisers as\r\nbeing to scout for a battle-fleet. It is perfectly true that the control\r\ndepends ultimately on the battle-fleet if control is disputed by a hostile\r\nbattle-fleet, as it usually is. It is also true that, so far as is\r\nnecessary to enable the battle-fleet to secure the control, we have to\r\nfurnish it with eyes from our cruiser force. But it does not follow that\r\nthis is the primary function of cruisers. The truth is, we have to withdraw\r\nthem from their primary function in order to do work for the battle-fleet\r\nwhich it cannot do for itself.\r\n\r\nWell established as is the \"Eyes of the fleet\" maxim, it would be very\r\ndifficult to show that scouting was ever regarded as the primary function\r\nof cruisers by the highest authorities. In Nelson's practice at least their\r\nparamount function was to exercise the control which he was securing with\r\nhis battle-squadron. Nothing is more familiar in naval history than his\r\nincessant cry from the Mediterranean for more cruisers, but the\r\nsignificance of that cry has become obscured. It was not that his cruisers\r\nwere not numerous in proportion to his battleships--they were usually\r\nnearly double in number--but it was rather that he was so deeply convinced\r\nof their true function, that he used them to exercise control to an extent\r\nwhich sometimes reduced his fleet cruisers below the limit of bare\r\nnecessity. The result on a memorable occasion was the escape of the enemy's\r\nbattle-fleet, but the further result is equally important. It was that the\r\nescape of that fleet did not deprive him of the control which he was\r\ncharged to maintain. His judgment may have been at fault, but the\r\nstrategical distribution of his force was consistent throughout the whole\r\nperiod of his Mediterranean command. Judged by his record, no man ever\r\ngrasped more clearly than Nelson that the object of naval warfare was to\r\ncontrol communications, and if he found that he had not a sufficient number\r\nof cruisers to exercise that control and to furnish eyes for his\r\nbattle-fleet as well, it was the battle-fleet that was made to suffer, and\r\nsurely this is at least the logical view. Had the French been ready to risk\r\nsettling the question of the control in a fleet action, it would have been\r\ndifferent. He would then have been right to sacrifice the exercise of\r\ncontrol for the time in order to make sure that the action should take\r\nplace and end decisively in his favour. But he knew they were not ready to\r\ntake such a risk, and he refused to permit a purely defensive attitude on\r\nthe part of the enemy to delude him from the special function with which he\r\nhad been charged.\r\n\r\nIf the object of naval warfare is to control communications, then the\r\nfundamental requirement is the means of exercising that control. Logically,\r\ntherefore, if the enemy holds back from battle decision, we must relegate\r\nthe battle-fleet to a secondary position, for cruisers are the means of\r\nexercising control; the battle-fleet is but the means of preventing their\r\nbeing interfered with in their work. Put it to the test of actual practice.\r\nIn no case can we exercise control by battleships alone. Their\r\nspecialisation has rendered them unfit for the work, and has made them too\r\ncostly ever to be numerous enough. Even, therefore, if our enemy had no\r\nbattle-fleet we could not make control effective with battleships alone. We\r\nshould still require cruisers specialised for the work and in sufficient\r\nnumbers to cover the necessary ground. But the converse is not true. We\r\ncould exercise control with cruisers alone if the enemy had no battle-fleet\r\nto interfere with them.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we seek a formula that will express the practical results of our\r\ntheory, it would take some such shape as this. On cruisers depends our\r\nexercise of control; on the battle-fleet depends the security of control.\r\nThat is the logical sequence of ideas, and it shows us that the current\r\nmaxim is really the conclusion of a logical argument in which the initial\r\nsteps must not be ignored. The maxim that the command of the sea depends on\r\nthe battle-fleet is then perfectly sound so long as it is taken to include\r\nall the other facts on which it hangs. The true function of the\r\nbattle-fleet is to protect cruisers and flotilla at their special work. The\r\nbest means of doing this is of course to destroy the enemy's power of\r\ninterference. The doctrine of destroying the enemy's armed forces as the\r\nparamount object here reasserts itself, and reasserts itself so strongly as\r\nto permit for most practical purposes the rough generalisation that the\r\ncommand depends upon the battle-fleet.\r\n\r\nOf what practical use then, it may be asked, is all this hairsplitting? Why\r\nnot leave untainted the conviction that our first and foremost business is\r\nto crush the enemy's battle-fleet, and that to this end our whole effort\r\nshould be concentrated? The answer is to point to Nelson's dilemma. It was\r\na dilemma which, in the golden age of naval warfare, every admiral at sea\r\nhad had to solve for himself, and it was always one of the most difficult\r\ndetails of every naval war plan. If we seek to ensure the effective action\r\nof the battle-fleet by giving it a large proportion of cruisers, by so much\r\ndo we weaken the actual and continuous exercise of control. If we seek to\r\nmake that control effective by devoting to the service a large proportion\r\nof cruisers, by so much do we prejudice our chance of getting contact with\r\nand defeating the enemy's battle-fleet, which is the only means of\r\nperfecting control.\r\n\r\nThe correct solution of the dilemma will of course depend upon the\r\nconditions of each case--mainly upon the relative strength and activity of\r\nthe hostile battle-fleet and our enemy's probable intentions. But no matter\r\nhow completely we have tabulated all the relevant facts, we can never hope\r\nto come to a sound conclusion upon them without a just appreciation of all\r\nthe elements which go to give command, and without the power of gauging\r\ntheir relative importance. This, and this alone, will ultimately settle the\r\nvital question of what proportion of our cruiser force it is right to\r\ndevote to the battle-fleet.\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine of cruiser control be correct, then every cruiser attached\r\nto the battle-fleet is one withdrawn from its true function. Such\r\nwithdrawals are inevitable. A squadron of battleships is an imperfect\r\norganism unable to do its work without cruiser assistance, and since the\r\nperformance of its work is essential to cruiser freedom, some cruisers must\r\nbe sacrificed. But in what proportion? If we confine ourselves to the view\r\nthat command depends on the battle-fleet, then we shall attach to it such a\r\nnumber as its commander may deem necessary to make contact with the enemy\r\nabsolutely certain and to surround himself with an impenetrable screen. If\r\nwe knew the enemy was as anxious for a decision as ourselves, such a course\r\nmight be justified. But the normal condition is that if we desire a\r\ndecision it is because we have definite hopes of success, and consequently\r\nthe enemy will probably seek to avoid one on our terms. In practice this\r\nmeans that if we have perfected our arrangements for the destruction of his\r\nmain fleet he will refuse to expose it till he sees a more favourable\r\nopportunity. And what will be the result? He remains on the defensive, and\r\ntheoretically all the ensuing period of inaction tends to fall into his\r\nscale. Without stirring from port his fleet is doing its work. The more\r\nclosely he induces us to concentrate our cruiser force in face of his\r\nbattle-fleet, the more he frees the sea for the circulation of his own\r\ntrade, and the more he exposes ours to cruiser raids.\r\n\r\nExperience, then, and theory alike dictate that as a general principle\r\ncruisers should be regarded as primarily concerned with the active\r\noccupation of communications, and that withdrawals for fleet purposes\r\nshould be reduced to the furthest margin of reasonable risk. What that\r\nmargin should be can only be decided on the circumstances of each case as\r\nit arises, and by the personal characteristics of the officers who are\r\nresponsible. Nelson's practice was to reduce fleet cruisers lower than\r\nperhaps any other commander. So small indeed was the margin of efficiency\r\nhe left, that in the campaign already cited, when his judgment was ripest,\r\none stroke of ill-luck--a chance betrayal of his position by a\r\nneutral--availed to deprive him of the decision he sought, and to let the\r\nenemy's fleet escape.\r\n\r\nWe arrive, then, at this general conclusion. The object of naval warfare is\r\nto control maritime communications. In order to exercise that control\r\neffectively we must have a numerous class of vessels specially adapted for\r\npursuit. But their power of exercising control is in proportion to our\r\ndegree of command, that is, to our power of preventing their operations\r\nbeing interfered with by the enemy. Their own power of resistance is in\r\ninverse proportion to their power of exercising control; that is to say,\r\nthe more numerous and better adapted they are for preying on commerce and\r\ntransports, the weaker will be their individual fighting power. We cannot\r\ngive them as a whole the power of resisting disturbance without at the same\r\ntime reducing their power of exercising control. The accepted solution of\r\nthe difficulty during the great period of Anson's school was to provide\r\nthem with a covering force of battle units specially adapted for fighting.\r\nBut here arises a correlative difficulty. In so far as we give our battle\r\nunits fighting power we deny them scouting power, and scouting is essential\r\nto their effective operation. The battle-fleet must have eyes. Now, vessels\r\nadapted for control of communications are also well adapted for \"eyes.\" It\r\nbecomes the practice, therefore, to withdraw from control operations a\r\nsufficient number of units to enable the battle-fleet to cover effectively\r\nthe operations of those that remain.\r\n\r\nSuch were the broad principles on which the inevitable dilemma always had\r\nto be solved, and on which Anson's organisation was based. They flow\r\nnaturally from the communication theory of maritime war, and it was this\r\ntheory which then dominated naval thought, as is apparent from the\r\ntechnical use of such phrases as \"lines of passage and communication.\" The\r\nwar plans of the great strategists from Anson and Barham can always be\r\nresolved into these simple elements, and where we find the Admiralty grip\r\nof them loosened, we have the confusion and quite unnecessary failures of\r\nthe War of American Independence. In that mismanaged contest the cardinal\r\nmistake was that we suffered the enemy's battle-fleets to get upon and\r\noccupy the vital lines of \"passage and communication\" without first\r\nbringing them to action, an error partly due to the unreadiness of a weak\r\nadministration, and partly to an insufficient allocation of cruisers to\r\nsecure contact at the right places.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, the principles on which our naval supremacy was built up are\r\nclear. For the enemies with whom we had to deal Anson's system was\r\nadmirably conceived. Both Spain and France held the communication theory so\r\nstrongly, that they were content to count as success the power of\r\ncontinually disturbing our control without any real attempt to secure it\r\nfor themselves. To defeat such a policy Anson's constitution and the\r\nstrategy it connoted were thoroughly well adapted and easy to work. But it\r\nby no means follows that his doctrine is the last word. Even in his own\r\ntime complications had begun to develop which tended to confuse the\r\nprecision of his system. By the culminating year of Trafalgar there were\r\nindications that it was getting worn out, while the new methods and\r\nmaterial used by the Americans in 1812 made a serious rent in it. The\r\ndisturbances then inaugurated have continued to develop, and it is\r\nnecessary to consider how seriously they have confused the problem of fleet\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is the general recognition, always patent to ourselves, that\r\nby far the most drastic, economical, and effective way of securing control\r\nis to destroy the enemy's means of interfering with it. In our own service\r\nthis \"overthrow\" idea always tended to assert itself so strongly, that\r\noccasionally the means became for a time more important than the end; that\r\nis to say, circumstances were such that on occasions it was considered\r\nadvisable to sacrifice the exercise of control for a time in order quickly\r\nand permanently to deprive the enemy of all means of interference. When\r\nthere was reasonable hope of the enemy risking a decision this\r\nconsideration tended to override all others; but when, as in Nelson's case\r\nin the Mediterranean, the hope was small, the exercise of control tended to\r\ntake the paramount place.\r\n\r\nThe second complexity arose from the fact that however strong might be our\r\nbattleship cover, it is impossible for it absolutely to secure cruiser\r\ncontrol from disturbance by sporadic attack. Isolated heavy ships, taking\r\nadvantage of the chances of the sea, could elude even the strictest\r\nblockade, and one such ship, if she succeeded in getting upon a line of\r\ncommunication, might paralyse the operations of a number of weaker units.\r\nThey must either run or concentrate, and in either case the control was\r\nbroken. If it were a squadron of heavy ships that caused the disturbance,\r\nthe practice was to detach against it a division of the covering\r\nbattle-fleet. But it was obviously highly inconvenient and contrary to the\r\nwhole idea on which the constitution of the fleet was based to allow every\r\nslight danger to cruiser control to loosen the cohesion of the main fleet.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, then, to give cruiser lines some power of resistance.\r\nThis necessity once admitted, there seemed no point at which you could stop\r\nincreasing the fighting power of your cruisers, and sooner or later, unless\r\nsome means of checking the process were found, the distinction between\r\ncruisers and battleships would practically disappear. Such a means was\r\nfound in what may be called the \"Intermediate\" ship. Frigates did indeed\r\ncontinue to increase in size and fighting power throughout the remainder of\r\nthe sailing era, but it was not only in this manner that the power of\r\nresistance was gained. The evil results of the movement were checked by the\r\nintroduction of a supporting ship, midway between frigates and true\r\nships-of-the-line. Sometimes classed as a battleship, and taking her place\r\nin the line, the 50-gun ship came to be essentially a type for stiffening\r\ncruiser squadrons. They most commonly appear as the flagships of cruiser\r\ncommodores, or stationed in terminal waters or at focal points where\r\nsporadic raids were likely to fall and be most destructive. The strategical\r\neffect of the presence of such a vessel in a cruiser line was to give the\r\nwhole line in some degree the strength of the intermediate ship; for any\r\nhostile cruiser endeavouring to disturb the line was liable to have to deal\r\nwith the supporting ship, while if a frigate and a 50-gun ship got together\r\nthey were a match even for a small ship-of-the-line.\r\n\r\nIn sailing days, of course, this power of the supporting ship was weak\r\nowing to the imperfection of the means of distant communication between\r\nships at sea and the non-existence of such means beyond extreme range of\r\nvision. But as wireless telegraphy develops it is not unreasonable to\r\nexpect that the strategic value of the supporting or intermediate ship will\r\nbe found greater than it ever was in sailing days, and that for dealing\r\nwith sporadic disturbance the tendency will be for a cruiser line to\r\napproximate more and more in power of resistance to that of its strongest\r\nunit.\r\n\r\nFor fleet service a cruiser's power of resistance was hardly less valuable;\r\nfor though we speak of fleet cruisers as the eyes of the fleet, their\r\npurpose is almost equally to blindfold the enemy. Their duty is not only to\r\ndisclose the movements of the enemy, but also to act as a screen to conceal\r\nour own. The point was specially well marked in the blockades, where the\r\nold 50-gun ships are almost always found with the inshore cruiser squadron,\r\npreventing that squadron being forced by inquisitive frigates. Important as\r\nthis power of resistance in the screen was in the old days, it is tenfold\r\nmore important now, and the consequent difficulty of keeping cruisers\r\ndistinct from battleships is greater than ever. The reason for this is best\r\nconsidered under the third and most serious cause of complexity.\r\n\r\nThe third cause is the acquisition by the flotilla of battle power. It is a\r\nfeature of naval warfare that is entirely new.[10] For all practical\r\npurposes it was unknown until the full development of the mobile torpedo.\r\nIt is true that the fireship as originally conceived was regarded as having\r\nsomething of the same power. During the Dutch wars--the heyday of its\r\nvogue--its assigned power was on some occasions actually realised, as in\r\nthe burning of Lord Sandwich's flagship at the battle of Solebay, and the\r\ndestruction of the Spanish-Dutch fleet at Palermo by Duquesne. But as the\r\n\"nimbleness\" of great-ships increased with the ripening of seamanship and\r\nnaval architecture, the fireship as a battle weapon became almost\r\nnegligible, while a fleet at anchor was found to be thoroughly defensible\r\nby its own picket-boats. Towards the middle of the eighteenth century\r\nindeed the occasions on which the fireship could be used for its special\r\npurpose was regarded as highly exceptional, and though the type was\r\nretained till the end of the century, its normal functions differed not at\r\nall from those of the rest of the flotilla of which it then formed part.\r\n\r\n  [10] But not without analogous precedent. In the later Middle Ages small\r\n  craft were assigned the function in battle of trying to wedge up the\r\n  rudders of great ships or bore holes between wind and water. See Fighting\r\n  Instructions (Navy Record Society), p. 13.\r\n\r\nThose functions, as we have seen, expressed the cruising idea in its purest\r\nsense. It was numbers and mobility that determined flotilla types rather\r\nthan armament or capacity for sea-endurance. Their primary purpose was to\r\ncontrol communications in home and colonial waters against weakly armed\r\nprivateers. The type which these duties determined fitted them adequately\r\nfor the secondary purpose of inshore and despatch work with a fleet. It\r\nwas, moreover, on the ubiquity which their numbers gave them, and on their\r\npower of dealing with unarmed or lightly armed vessels, that we relied for\r\nour first line of defence against invasion. These latter duties were of\r\ncourse exceptional, and the Navy List did not carry as a rule sufficient\r\nnumbers for the purpose. But a special value of the class was that it was\r\ncapable of rapid and almost indefinite expansion from the mercantile\r\nmarine. Anything that could carry a gun had its use, and during the period\r\nof the Napoleonic threat the defence flotilla rose all told to considerably\r\nover a thousand units.\r\n\r\nFormidable and effective as was a flotilla of this type for the ends it was\r\ndesigned to serve, it obviously in no way affected the security of a\r\nbattle-fleet. But so soon as the flotilla acquired battle power the whole\r\nsituation was changed, and the old principles of cruiser design and\r\ndistribution were torn to shreds. The battle-fleet became a more imperfect\r\norganism than ever. Formerly it was only its offensive power that required\r\nsupplementing. The new condition meant that unaided it could no longer\r\nensure its own defence. It now required screening, not only from\r\nobservation, but also from flotilla attack. The theoretical weakness of an\r\narrested offensive received a practical and concrete illustration to a\r\ndegree that war had scarcely ever known. Our most dearly cherished\r\nstrategical traditions were shaken to the bottom. The \"proper place\" for\r\nour battle-fleet had always been \"on the enemy's coasts,\" and now that was\r\nprecisely where the enemy would be best pleased to see it. What was to be\r\ndone? So splendid a tradition could not lightly be laid aside, but the\r\nattempt to preserve it involved us still deeper in heresy. The vital, most\r\ndifficult, and most absorbing problem has become not how to increase the\r\npower of a battle-fleet for attack, which is a comparatively simple matter,\r\nbut how to defend it. As the offensive power of the flotilla developed, the\r\nproblem pressed with an almost bewildering intensity. With every increase\r\nin the speed and sea-keeping power of torpedo craft, the problem of the\r\nscreen grew more exacting. To keep the hostile flotilla out of night range\r\nthe screen must be flung out wider and wider, and this meant more and more\r\ncruisers withdrawn from their primary function. And not only this. The\r\nscreen must not only be far flung, but it must be made as far as possible\r\nimpenetrable. In other words, its own power of resistance must be increased\r\nall along the line. Whole squadrons of armoured cruisers had to be attached\r\nto battle-fleets to support the weaker members of the screen. The crying\r\nneed for this type of ship set up a rapid movement for increasing their\r\nfighting power, and with it fell with equal rapidity the economic\r\npossibility of giving the cruiser class its essential attribute of numbers.\r\n\r\nAs an inevitable result we find ourselves involved in an effort to restore\r\nto the flotilla some of its old cruiser capacity, by endowing it with gun\r\narmament, higher sea-keeping power, and facilities for distant\r\ncommunication, all at the cost of specialisation and of greater economic\r\nstrain. Still judged by past experience, some means of increasing numbers\r\nin the cruising types is essential, nor is it clear how it is possible to\r\nsecure that essential in the ranks of the true cruiser. No point has been\r\nfound at which it was possible to stop the tendency of this class of vessel\r\nto increase in size and cost, or to recall it to the strategical position\r\nit used to occupy. So insecure is the battle-squadron, so imperfect as a\r\nself-contained weapon has it become, that its need has overridden the old\r\norder of things, and the primary function of the cruising ship inclines to\r\nbe no longer the exercise of control under cover of the battle-fleet. The\r\nbattle-fleet now demands protection by the cruising ship, and what the\r\nbattle-fleet needs is held to be the first necessity.\r\n\r\nJudged by the old naval practice, it is an anomalous position to have\r\nreached. But the whole naval art has suffered a revolution beyond all\r\nprevious experience, and it is possible the old practice is no longer a\r\nsafe guide. Driven by the same necessities, every naval Power is following\r\nthe same course. It may be right, it may be wrong; no one at least but the\r\nignorant or hasty will venture to pass categorical judgment. The best we\r\ncan do is to endeavour to realise the situation to which, in spite of all\r\nmisgivings, we have been forced, and to determine its relations to the\r\ndevelopments of the past.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly a difficult task. As we have seen, there have prevailed\r\nin the constitution of fleets at various times several methods of\r\nexpressing the necessities of naval war. The present system differs from\r\nthem all. On the one hand, we have the fact that the latest developments of\r\ncruiser power have finally obliterated all logical distinction between\r\ncruisers and battleships, and we thus find ourselves hand in hand with the\r\nfleet constitution of the old Dutch wars. On the other, however, we have\r\narmoured cruisers organised in squadrons and attached to battle-fleets not\r\nonly for strategical purposes, but also with as yet undeveloped tactical\r\nfunctions in battle. Here we come close to the latest development of the\r\nsailing era, when \"Advanced\" or \"Light\" squadrons began to appear in the\r\norganisation of battle-fleets.\r\n\r\nThe system arose towards the end of the eighteenth century in the\r\nMediterranean, where the conditions of control called for so wide a\r\ndispersal of cruisers and so great a number of them, that it was almost\r\nimperative for a battle-squadron in that sea to do much of its own\r\nscouting. It was certainly for this purpose that the fastest and lightest\r\nships-of-the-line were formed into a separate unit, and the first\r\ndesignation it received was that of \"Observation Squadron.\" It remained for\r\nNelson to endeavour to endow it with a tactical function, but his idea was\r\nnever realised either by himself or any of his successors.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this new element in the organisation of a battle-fleet,\r\nwhich perhaps is best designated as a \"Light Division,\" we have another\r\nsignificant fact. Not only was it not always composed entirely of\r\nships-of-the-line, especially in the French service, but in 1805, the year\r\nof the full development, we have Sir Richard Strachan using the heavy\r\nfrigates attached to his battle-squadron as a \"Light Division,\" and giving\r\nthem a definite tactical function. The collapse of the French Navy put a\r\nstop to further developments of either idea. Whither they would have led we\r\ncannot tell. But it is impossible to shut our eyes to the indication of a\r\ngrowing tendency towards the system that exists at present. It is difficult\r\nat least to ignore the fact that both Nelson and Strachan in that\r\nculminating year found the actuality of war calling for something for which\r\nthere was then no provision in the constitution of the fleet, but which it\r\ndoes contain to-day. What Nelson felt for was a battleship of cruiser\r\nspeed. What Strachan desired was a cruiser fit to take a tactical part in a\r\nfleet action. We have them both, but with what result? Anson's\r\nspecialisation of types has almost disappeared, and our present fleet\r\nconstitution is scarcely to be distinguished from that of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. We retain the three-fold nomenclature, but the system itself has\r\nreally gone. Battleships grade into armoured cruisers, armoured cruisers\r\ninto protected cruisers. We can scarcely detect any real distinction except\r\na twofold one between vessels whose primary armament is the gun and vessels\r\nwhose primary armament is the torpedo. But even here the existence of a\r\ntype of cruiser designed to act with flotillas blurs the outline, while, as\r\nwe have seen, the larger units of the flotilla are grading up to cruiser\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nWe are thus face to face with a situation which has its closest counterpart\r\nin the structureless fleets of the seventeenth century. That naval thought\r\nshould have so nearly retraced its steps in the course of two centuries is\r\ncurious enough, but it is still more striking when we consider how widely\r\nthe underlying causes differ in each case. The pressure which has forced\r\nthe present situation is due most obviously to two causes. One is the\r\nexcessive development of the \"intermediate\" ship originally devised for\r\npurposes of commerce protection, and dictated by a menace which the\r\nexperience of the American War had taught us to respect. The other is the\r\nintroduction of the torpedo, and the consequent vulnerability of\r\nbattle-squadrons that are not securely screened. Nothing of the kind had\r\nany influence on the fleet constitution of the seventeenth century. But if\r\nwe seek deeper, there is a less obvious consideration which for what it is\r\nworth is too striking to be ignored.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested above that the constitution of fleets appears to have\r\nsome more or less recognisable relation to the prevalent theory of war.\r\nNow, amongst all our uncertainty we can assert with confidence that the\r\ntheory which holds the field at the present day bears the closest possible\r\nresemblance to that which dominated the soldier-admirals of the Dutch war.\r\nIt was the \"Overthrow\" theory, the firm faith in the decisive action as the\r\nkey of all strategical problems. They carried it to sea with them from the\r\nbattlefields of the New Model Army, and the Dutch met them squarely. In the\r\nfirst war at least their commerce had to give place to the exigencies of\r\nthrowing into the battle everything that could affect the issue. It is not\r\nof course pretended that this attitude was dictated by any clearly\r\nconceived theory of absolute war. It was due rather to the fact that, owing\r\nto the relative geographical conditions, all attempts to guard trade\r\ncommunications were useless without the command of the home waters in the\r\nNorth Sea, and the truth received a clinching moral emphasis from the\r\nBritish claim to the actual dominion of the Narrow Seas. It was, in fact, a\r\nwar which resembled rather the continental conditions of territorial\r\nconquest than the naval procedure that characterised our rivalry with\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIs it then possible, however much we may resist the conclusion in loyalty\r\nto the eighteenth-century tradition, that the rise of a new naval Power in\r\nthe room of Holland must bring us back to the drastic, if crude, methods of\r\nthe Dutch wars, and force us to tread under foot the nicer ingenuity of\r\nAnson's system? Is it this which has tempted us to mistrust any type of\r\nvessel which cannot be flung into the battle? The recurrence of a\r\nformidable rival in the North Sea was certainly not the first cause of the\r\nreaction. It began before that menace arose. Still it has undoubtedly\r\nforced the pace, and even if it be not a cause, it may well be a\r\njustification.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n              THEORY OF THE METHOD--\r\n     CONCENTRATION AND DISPERSAL OF FORCE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the method by which its ends are obtained,\r\nstrategy is often described as the art of assembling the utmost force at\r\nthe right time and place; and this method is called \"Concentration.\"\r\n\r\nAt first sight the term seems simple and expressive enough, but on analysis\r\nit will be found to include several distinct ideas, to all of which the\r\nterm is applied indifferently. The result is a source of some confusion,\r\neven to the most lucid writers. \"The word concentration,\" says one of the\r\nmost recent of them, \"evokes the idea of a grouping of forces. We believe,\r\nin fact, that we cannot make war without grouping ships into squadrons and\r\nsquadrons into fleets.\"[11] Here in one sentence the word hovers between\r\nthe formation of fleets and their strategical distribution. Similar\r\nlooseness will embarrass the student at every turn. At one time he will\r\nfind the word used to express the antithesis of division or dispersal of\r\nforce; at another, to express strategic deployment, which implies division\r\nto a greater or less extent. He will find it used of the process of\r\nassembling a force, as well as of the state of a force when the process is\r\ncomplete. The truth is that the term, which is one of the most common and\r\nmost necessary in strategical discussion, has never acquired a very precise\r\nmeaning, and this lack of precision is one of the commonest causes of\r\nconflicting opinion and questionable judgments. No strategical term indeed\r\ncalls more urgently for a clear determination of the ideas for which it\r\nstands.\r\n\r\n  [11] Daveluy, _L'Esprit de la Guerre Navale_, vol. i, p. 27, note.\r\n\r\nMilitary phraseology, from which the word is taken, employs \"concentration\"\r\nin three senses. It is used for assembling the units of an army after they\r\nhave been mobilised. In this sense, concentration is mainly an\r\nadministrative process; logically, it means the complement of the process\r\nof mobilisation, whereby the army realises its war organisation and becomes\r\nready to take the field. In a second sense it is used for the process of\r\nmoving the army when formed, or in process of formation, to the localities\r\nfrom which operations can best begin. This is a true strategical stage, and\r\nit culminates in what is known as strategic deployment. Finally, it is used\r\nfor the ultimate stage when the army so deployed is closed up upon a\r\ndefinite line of operations in immediate readiness for tactical\r\ndeployment--gathered up, that is, to deal a concentrated blow.\r\n\r\nWell as this terminology appears to serve on land, where the processes tend\r\nto overlap, something more exact is required if we try to extend it to the\r\nsea. Such extension magnifies the error at every step, and clear thinking\r\nbecomes difficult. Even if we set aside the first meaning, that is, the\r\nfinal stage of mobilisation, we have still to deal with the two others\r\nwhich, in a great measure, are mutually contradictory. The essential\r\ndistinction of strategic deployment, which contemplates dispersal with a\r\nview to a choice of combinations, is flexibility and free movement. The\r\ncharacteristic of an army massed for a blow is rigidity and restricted\r\nmobility. In the one sense of concentration we contemplate a disposal of\r\nforce which will conceal our intention from the enemy and will permit us to\r\nadapt our movements to the plan of operations he develops. In the other,\r\nstrategic concealment is at an end. We have made our choice, and are\r\ncommitted to a definite operation. Clearly, then, if we would apply the\r\nprinciples of land concentration to naval warfare it is desirable to settle\r\nwhich of the two phases of an operation we mean by the term.\r\n\r\nWhich meaning, then, is most closely connected with the ordinary use of the\r\nword? The dictionaries define concentration as \"the state of being brought\r\nto a common point or centre,\" and this coincides very exactly with the\r\nstage of a war plan which intervenes between the completion of mobilisation\r\nand the final massing or deployment for battle. It is an incomplete and\r\ncontinuing act. Its ultimate consequence is the mass. It is a method of\r\nsecuring mass at the right time and place. As we have seen, the essence of\r\nthe state of strategic deployment to which it leads is flexibility. In war\r\nthe choice of time and place will always be influenced by the enemy's\r\ndispositions and movements, or by our desire to deal him an unexpected\r\nblow. The merit of concentration, then, in this sense, is its power of\r\npermitting us to form our mass in time at one of the greatest number of\r\ndifferent points where mass may be required.\r\n\r\nIt is for this stage that the more recent text-books incline to specialise\r\nconcentration--qualifying it as \"strategic concentration.\" But even that\r\nterm scarcely meets the case, for the succeeding process of gathering up\r\nthe army into a position for tactical deployment is also a strategical\r\nconcentration. Some further specialisation is required. The analytical\r\ndifference between the two processes is that the first is an operation of\r\nmajor strategy and the other of minor, and if they are to be fully\r\nexpressed, we have to weight ourselves with the terms \"major and minor\r\nstrategic concentration.\"\r\n\r\nSuch cumbrous terminology is too forbidding to use. It serves only to mark\r\nthat the middle stage differs logically from the third as much as it does\r\nfrom the first. In practice it comes to this. If we are going to use\r\nconcentration in its natural sense, we must regard it as something that\r\ncomes after complete mobilisation and stops short of the formation of mass.\r\n\r\nIn naval warfare at least this distinction between concentration and mass\r\nis essential to clear appreciation. It leads us to conclusions that are of\r\nthe first importance. For instance, when once the mass is formed,\r\nconcealment and flexibility are at an end. The further, therefore, from the\r\nformation of the ultimate mass we can stop the process of concentration the\r\nbetter designed it will be. The less we are committed to any particular\r\nmass, and the less we indicate what and where our mass is to be, the more\r\nformidable our concentration. To concentration, therefore, the idea of\r\ndivision is as essential as the idea of connection. It is this view of the\r\nprocess which, at least for naval warfare, a weighty critical authority has\r\nmost strongly emphasised. \"Such,\" he says, \"is concentration reasonably\r\nunderstood--not huddled together like a drove of sheep, but distributed\r\nwith a regard to a common purpose, and linked together by the effectual\r\nenergy of a single will.\"[12] Vessels in a state of concentration he\r\ncompares to a fan that opens and shuts. In this view concentration connotes\r\nnot a homogeneous body, but a compound organism controlled from a common\r\ncentre, and elastic enough to permit it to cover a wide field without\r\nsacrificing the mutual support of its parts.\r\n\r\n  [12] Mahan, _War of 1812_, i, 316.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we exclude the meaning of mere assembling and the meaning of the\r\nmass, we have left a signification which expresses coherent disposal about\r\na strategical centre, and this it will be seen gives for naval warfare just\r\nthe working definition that we want as the counterpart of strategic\r\ndeployment on land. The object of a naval concentration like that of\r\nstrategic deployment will be to cover the widest possible area, and to\r\npreserve at the same time elastic cohesion, so as to secure rapid\r\ncondensations of any two or more of the parts of the organism, and in any\r\npart of the area to be covered, at the will of the controlling mind; and\r\nabove all, a sure and rapid condensation of the whole at the strategical\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nConcentration of this nature, moreover, will be the expression of a war\r\nplan which, while solidly based on an ultimate central mass, still\r\npreserves the faculty of delivering or meeting minor attacks in any\r\ndirection. It will permit us to exercise control of the sea while we await\r\nand work for the opportunity of a decision which shall permanently secure\r\ncontrol, and it will permit this without prejudicing our ability of\r\nbringing the utmost force to bear when the moment for the decision arrives.\r\nConcentration, in fact, implies a continual conflict between cohesion and\r\nreach, and for practical purposes it is the right adjustment of those two\r\ntensions--ever shifting in force--which constitutes the greater part of\r\npractical strategy.\r\n\r\nIn naval warfare this concentration stage has a peculiar significance in\r\nthe development of a campaign, and at sea it is more clearly detached than\r\nashore. Owing to the vast size of modern armies, and the restricted nature\r\nof their lines of movement, no less than their lower intrinsic mobility as\r\ncompared with fleets, the processes of assembly, concentration, and forming\r\nthe battle mass tend to grade into one another without any demarcation of\r\npractical value. An army frequently reaches the stage of strategic\r\ndeployment direct from the mobilisation bases of its units, and on famous\r\noccasions its only real concentration has taken place on the battlefield.\r\nIn Continental warfare, then, there is less difficulty in using the term to\r\ncover all three processes. Their tendency is always to overlap. But at sea,\r\nwhere communications are free and unrestricted by obstacles, and where\r\nmobility is high, they are susceptible of sharper differentiation. The\r\nnormal course is for a fleet to assemble at a naval port; thence by a\r\ndistinct movement it proceeds to the strategical centre and reaches out in\r\ndivisions as required. The concentration about that centre may be very far\r\nfrom a mass, and the final formation of the mass will bear no resemblance\r\nto either of the previous movements, and will be quite distinct.\r\n\r\nBut free as a fleet is from the special fetters of an army, there always\r\nexist at sea peculiar conditions of friction which clog its freedom of\r\ndisposition. One source of this friction is commerce protection. However\r\nmuch our war plan may press for close concentration, the need of commerce\r\nprotection will always be calling for dispersal. The other source is the\r\npeculiar freedom and secrecy of movements at sea. As the sea knows no roads\r\nto limit or indicate our own lines of operation, so it tells little about\r\nthose of the enemy. The most distant and widely dispersed points must be\r\nkept in view as possible objectives of the enemy. When we add to this that\r\ntwo or more fleets can act in conjunction from widely separated bases with\r\nfar greater certainty than is possible for armies, it is obvious that the\r\nvariety of combinations is much higher at sea than on land, and variety of\r\ncombination is in constant opposition to the central mass.\r\n\r\nIt follows that so long as the enemy's fleet is divided, and thereby\r\nretains various possibilities of either concentrated or sporadic action,\r\nour distribution will be dictated by the need of being able to deal with a\r\nvariety of combinations and to protect a variety of objectives. Our\r\nconcentrations must therefore be kept as open and flexible as possible.\r\nHistory accordingly shows us that the riper and fresher our experience and\r\nthe surer our grip of war, the looser were our concentrations. The idea of\r\nmassing, as a virtue in itself, is bred in peace and not in war. It\r\nindicates the debilitating idea that in war we must seek rather to avoid\r\nthan to inflict defeat. True, advocates of the mass entrench themselves in\r\nthe plausible conception that their aim is to inflict crushing defeats. But\r\nthis too is an idea of peace. War has proved to the hilt that victories\r\nhave not only to be won, but worked for. They must be worked for by bold\r\nstrategical combinations, which as a rule entail at least apparent\r\ndispersal. They can only be achieved by taking risks, and the greatest and\r\nmost effective of these is division.\r\n\r\nThe effect of prolonged peace has been to make \"concentration\" a kind of\r\nshibboleth, so that the division of a fleet tends almost to be regarded as\r\na sure mark of bad leadership. Critics have come to lose sight of the old\r\nwar experience, that without division no strategical combinations are\r\npossible. In truth they must be founded on division. Division is bad only\r\nwhen it is pushed beyond the limits of well-knit deployment. It is\r\ntheoretically wrong to place a section of the fleet in such a position that\r\nit may be prevented from falling back on its strategical centre when it is\r\nencountered by a superior force. Such retreats of course can never be made\r\ncertain; they will always depend in some measure on the skill and resource\r\nof the opposing commanders, and on the chances of weather: but risks must\r\nbe taken. If we risk nothing, we shall seldom perform anything. The great\r\nleader is the man who can measure rightly to what breadth of deployment he\r\ncan stretch his concentration. This power of bold and sure adjustment\r\nbetween cohesion and reach is indeed a supreme test of that judgment which\r\nin the conduct of war takes the place of strategical theory.\r\n\r\nIn British naval history examples of faulty division are hard to find. The\r\ncase most commonly cited is an early one. It occurred in 1666 during the\r\nsecond Dutch war. Monk and Rupert were in command of the main fleet, which\r\nfrom its mobilisation bases in the Thames and at Spithead had concentrated\r\nin the Downs. There they were awaiting De Ruyter's putting to sea in a\r\nposition from which they could deal with him whether his object was an\r\nattack on the Thames or to join hands with the French. In this position a\r\nrumour reached them that the Toulon squadron was on its way to the Channel\r\nto co-operate with the Dutch. Upon this false intelligence the fleet was\r\ndivided, and Rupert went back to Portsmouth to cover that position in case\r\nit might be the French objective. De Ruyter at once put to sea with a fleet\r\ngreatly superior to Monk's division. Monk, however, taking advantage of\r\nthick weather that had supervened, surprised him at anchor, and believing\r\nhe had a sufficient tactical advantage attacked him impetuously. Meanwhile\r\nthe real situation became known. There was no French fleet, and Rupert was\r\nrecalled. He succeeded in rejoining Monk after his action with De Ruyter\r\nhad lasted three days. In the course of it Monk had been very severely\r\nhandled and forced to retreat to the Thames, and it was generally believed\r\nthat it was only the belated arrival of Rupert that saved us from a real\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nThe strategy in this case is usually condemned out of hand and made to bear\r\nthe entire blame of the reverse. Monk, who as a soldier had proved himself\r\none of the finest strategists of the time, is held to have blundered from\r\nsheer ignorance of elementary principles. It is assumed that he should have\r\nkept his fleet massed; but his critics fail to observe that at least in the\r\nopinion of the time this would not have met the case. Had he kept the whole\r\nto deal with De Ruyter, it is probable that De Ruyter would not have put to\r\nsea, and it is certain Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight would have lain\r\nopen to the French had they come. If he had moved his mass to deal with the\r\nFrench, he would have exposed the Thames to De Ruyter. It was a situation\r\nthat could not be solved by a simple application of what the French call\r\nthe _masse centrale_. The only way to secure both places from attack was to\r\ndivide the fleet, just as in 1801 Nelson in the same theatre was compelled\r\nto divide his defence force. In neither case was division a fault, because\r\nit was a necessity. The fault in Monk's and Rupert's case was that they\r\nextended their reach with no proper provision to preserve cohesion. Close\r\ncruiser connection should have been maintained between the two divisions,\r\nand Monk should not have engaged deeply till he felt Rupert at his elbow.\r\nThis we are told was the opinion of most of his flag-officers. They held\r\nthat he should not have fought when he did. His correct course, on\r\nKempenfelt's principle, would have been to hang on De Ruyter so as to\r\nprevent his doing anything, and to have slowly fallen back, drawing the\r\nDutch after him till his loosened concentration was closed up again. If De\r\nRuyter had refused to follow him through the Straits, there would have been\r\nplenty of time to mass the fleet. If De Ruyter had followed, he could have\r\nbeen fought in a position from which there would have been no escape. The\r\nfault, in fact, was not strategical, but rather one of tactical judgment.\r\nMonk over-estimated the advantage of his surprise and the relative fighting\r\nvalues of the two fleets, and believed he saw his way to victory\r\nsingle-handed. The danger of division is being surprised and forced to\r\nfight in inferiority. This was not Monk's case. He was not surprised, and\r\nhe could easily have avoided action had he so desired. To judge such a case\r\nsimply by using concentration as a touchstone can only tend to set up such\r\nquestionable habits of thought as have condemned the more famous division\r\nwhich occurred in the crisis of the campaign of 1805, and with which we\r\nmust deal later.\r\n\r\nApart from the general danger of using either words or maxims in this way,\r\nit is obviously specially unwise in the case of concentration and division.\r\nThe current rule is that it is bad to divide unless you have a great\r\nsuperiority; yet there have been numerous occasions when, being at war with\r\nan inferior enemy, we have found our chief embarrassment in the fact that\r\nhe kept his fleet divided, and was able thereby to set up something like a\r\ndeadlock. The main object of our naval operations would then be to break it\r\ndown. To force an inferior enemy to concentrate is indeed the almost\r\nnecessary preliminary to securing one of those crushing victories at which\r\nwe must always aim, but which so seldom are obtained. It is by forcing the\r\nenemy to attempt to concentrate that we get our opportunity by sagacious\r\ndispersal of crushing his divisions in detail. It is by inducing him to\r\nmass that we simplify our problem and compel him to choose between leaving\r\nto us the exercise of command and putting it to the decision of a great\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAdvocates of close concentration will reply that that is true enough. We do\r\noften seek to force our enemy to concentrate, but that does not show that\r\nconcentration is sometimes a disadvantage, for we ourselves must\r\nconcentrate closely to force a similar concentration on the enemy. The\r\nmaxim, indeed, has become current that concentration begets concentration,\r\nbut it is not too much to say that it is a maxim which history flatly\r\ncontradicts. If the enemy is willing to hazard all on a battle, it is true.\r\nBut if we are too superior, or our concentration too well arranged for him\r\nto hope for victory, then our concentration has almost always had the\r\neffect of forcing him to disperse for sporadic action. So certain was this\r\nresult, that in our old wars, in which we were usually superior, we always\r\nadopted the loosest possible concentrations in order to prevent sporadic\r\naction. True, the tendency of the French to adopt this mode of warfare is\r\nusually set down to some constitutional ineptitude that is outside\r\nstrategical theory, but this view is due rather to the irritation which the\r\nmethod caused us, than to sober reasoning. For a comparatively weak\r\nbelligerent sporadic action was better than nothing, and the only other\r\nalternative was for him to play into our hands by hazarding the decision\r\nwhich it was our paramount interest to obtain. Sporadic action alone could\r\nnever give our enemy command of the sea, but it could do us injury and\r\nembarrass our plans, and there was always hope it might so much loosen our\r\nconcentration as to give him a fair chance of obtaining a series of\r\nsuccessful minor decisions.\r\n\r\nTake, now, the leading case of 1805. In that campaign our distribution was\r\nvery wide, and was based on several concentrations. The first had its\r\ncentre in the Downs, and extended not only athwart the invading army's line\r\nof passage, but also over the whole North Sea, so as to prevent\r\ninterference with our trade or our system of coast defence either from the\r\nDutch in the Texel or from French squadrons arriving north-about. The\r\nsecond, which was known as the Western Squadron, had its centre off Ushant,\r\nand was spread over the whole Bay of Biscay by means of advanced squadrons\r\nbefore Ferrol and Rochefort. With a further squadron off the coast of\r\nIreland, it was able also to reach far out into the Atlantic in order to\r\nreceive our trade. It kept guard, in fact, not only over the French naval\r\nports, but over the approaches to the Channel, where were the home\r\nterminals of the great southern and western trade-routes. A third\r\nconcentration was in the Mediterranean, whose centre under Nelson was at\r\nSardinia. It had outlying sub-centres at Malta and Gibraltar, and covered\r\nthe whole ground from Cape St. Vincent outside the Straits to Toulon,\r\nTrieste, and the Dardanelles. When war broke out with Spain in 1804, it was\r\nconsidered advisable to divide this command, and Spanish waters outside the\r\nStraits were held by a fourth concentration, whose centre was off Cadiz,\r\nand whose northern limit was Cape Finisterre, where it joined the Ushant\r\nconcentration. For reasons which were personal rather than strategical this\r\narrangement was not continued long, nor indeed after a few months was there\r\nthe same need for it, for the Toulon squadron had changed its base to\r\nCadiz. By this comprehensive system the whole of the European seas were\r\ncontrolled both for military and trade purposes. In the distant terminal\r\nareas, like the East and West Indies, there were nucleus concentrations\r\nwith the necessary connective machinery permanently established, and to\r\nrender them effective, provision was made by which the various European\r\nsquadrons could throw off detachments to bring up their force to any\r\nstrength which the movements of the enemy might render necessary.\r\n\r\nWide as was this distribution, and great as its reach, a high degree of\r\ncohesion was maintained not only between the parts of each concentration,\r\nbut between the several concentrations themselves. By means of a minor\r\ncruiser centre at the Channel Islands, the Downs and Ushant concentrations\r\ncould rapidly cohere. Similarly the Cadiz concentration was linked up with\r\nthat of Ushant at Finisterre, and but for personal friction and repulsion,\r\nthe cohesion between the Mediterranean and Cadiz concentrations would have\r\nbeen equally strong. Finally, there was a masterly provision made for all\r\nthe concentrations to condense into one great mass at the crucial point off\r\nUshant before by any calculable chance a hostile mass could gather there.\r\n\r\nFor Napoleon's best admirals, \"who knew the craft of the sea,\" the British\r\nfleet thus disposed was in a state of concentration that nothing but a\r\nstroke of luck beyond the limit of sober calculation could break. Decrès\r\nand Bruix had no doubt of it, and the knowledge overpowered Villeneuve when\r\nthe crisis came. After he had carried the concentration which Napoleon had\r\nplanned so far as to have united three divisions in Ferrol, he knew that\r\nthe outlying sections of our Western Squadron had disappeared from before\r\nFerrol and Rochefort. In his eyes, as well as those of the British\r\nAdmiralty, this squadron, in spite of its dispersal in the Bay of Biscay,\r\nhad always been in a state of concentration. It was not this which caused\r\nhis heart to fail. It was the news that Nelson had reappeared at Gibraltar,\r\nand had been seen steering northward. It meant for him that the whole of\r\nhis enemy's European fleet was in a state of concentration. \"Their\r\nconcentration of force,\" he afterwards wrote, \"was at the moment more\r\nserious than in any previous disposition, and such that they were in a\r\nposition to meet in superiority the combined forces of Brest and Ferrol,\"\r\nand for that reason, he explained, he had given up the game as lost. But to\r\nNapoleon's unpractised eye it was impossible to see what it was he had to\r\ndeal with. Measuring the elasticity of the British naval distribution by\r\nthe comparatively cumbrous and restricted mobility of armies, he saw it as\r\na rash and unwarlike dispersal. Its looseness seemed to indicate so great a\r\ntenderness for the distant objectives that lay open to his scattered\r\nsquadrons, that he believed by a show of sporadic action he could further\r\ndisperse our fleet, and then by a close concentration crush the essential\r\npart in detail. It was a clear case of the enemy's dispersal forcing us to\r\nadopt the loosest concentration, and of our comparative dispersal tempting\r\nthe enemy to concentrate and hazard a decision. It cannot be said we forced\r\nthe fatal move upon him intentionally. It was rather the operation of\r\nstrategical law set in motion by our bold distribution. We were determined\r\nthat his threat of invasion, formidable as it was, should not force upon us\r\nso close a concentration as to leave our widespread interests open to his\r\nattack. Neither can it be said that our first aim was to prevent his\r\nattempting to concentrate. Every one of his naval ports was watched by a\r\nsquadron, but it was recognised that this would not prevent concentration.\r\nThe escape of one division might well break the chain. But that\r\nconsideration made no difference. The distribution of our squadrons before\r\nhis naval ports was essential for preventing sporadic action. Their\r\ndistribution was dictated sufficiently by the defence of commerce and of\r\ncolonial and allied territory, by our need, that is, to exercise a general\r\ncommand even if we could not destroy the enemy's force.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Nelson's correspondence for this period shows that his main\r\nobject was the protection of our Mediterranean trade and of Neapolitan and\r\nTurkish territory. When Villeneuve escaped him, his irritation was caused\r\nnot by the prospect of a French concentration, which had no anxieties for\r\nhim, for he knew counter-concentrations were provided for. It was caused\r\nrather by his having lost the opportunity which the attempt to concentrate\r\nhad placed within his reach. He followed Villeneuve to the West Indies, not\r\nto prevent concentration, but, firstly, to protect the local trade and\r\nJamaica, and secondly, in hope of another chance of dealing the blow he had\r\nmissed. Lord Barham took precisely the same view. When on news of\r\nVilleneuve's return from the West Indies he moved out the three divisions\r\nof the Western Squadron, that is, the Ushant concentration, to meet him, he\r\nexpressly stated, not that his object was to prevent concentration, but\r\nthat it was to deter the French from attempting sporadic action. \"The\r\ninterception of the fleet in question,\" he wrote, \"on its return to Europe\r\nwould be a greater object than any I know. It would damp all future\r\nexpeditions, and would show to Europe that it might be advisable to relax\r\nin the blockading system occasionally for the express purpose of putting\r\nthem in our hands at a convenient opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed we had no reason for preventing the enemy's concentration. It was\r\nour best chance of solving effectually the situation we have to confront.\r\nOur true policy was to secure permanent command by a great naval decision.\r\nSo long as the enemy remained divided, no such decision could be expected.\r\nIt was not, in fact, till he attempted his concentration, and its last\r\nstage had been reached, that the situation was in our hands. The intricate\r\nproblem with which we had been struggling was simplified down to closing up\r\nour own concentration to the strategical centre off Ushant. But at the last\r\nstage the enemy could not face the formidable position we held. His\r\nconcentration was stopped. Villeneuve fell back on Cadiz, and the problem\r\nbegan to assume for us something of its former intricacy. So long as we\r\nheld the mass off Ushant which our great concentration had produced, we\r\nwere safe from invasion. But that was not enough. It left the seas open to\r\nsporadic action from Spanish ports. There were convoys from the East and\r\nWest Indies at hand, and there was our expedition in the Mediterranean in\r\njeopardy, and another on the point of sailing from Cork. Neither Barham at\r\nthe Admiralty nor Cornwallis in command off Ushant hesitated an hour. By a\r\nsimultaneous induction they both decided the mass must be divided. The\r\nconcentration must be opened out again, and it was done. Napoleon called\r\nthe move an _insigne betise_, but it was the move that beat him, and must\r\nhave beaten him, whatever the skill of his admirals, for the two squadrons\r\nnever lost touch. He found himself caught in a situation from which there\r\nwas nothing to hope. His fleet was neither concentrated for a decisive blow\r\nnor spread for sporadic action. He had merely simplified his enemy's\r\nproblem. Our hold was surer than ever, and in a desperate attempt to\r\nextricate himself he was forced to expose his fleet to the final decision\r\nwe required.\r\n\r\nThe whole campaign serves well to show what was understood by concentration\r\nat the end of the great naval wars. To Lord Barham and the able admirals\r\nwho interpreted his plans it meant the possibility of massing at the right\r\ntime and place. It meant, in close analogy to strategic deployment on land,\r\nthe disposal of squadrons about a strategical centre from which fleets\r\ncould condense for massed action in any required direction, and upon which\r\nthey could fall back when unduly pressed. In this case the ultimate centre\r\nwas the narrows of the Channel, where Napoleon's army lay ready to cross,\r\nbut there was no massing there. So crude a distribution would have meant a\r\npurely defensive attitude. It would have meant waiting to be struck instead\r\nof seeking to strike, and such an attitude was arch-heresy to our old\r\nmasters of war.\r\n\r\nSo far we have only considered concentration as applied to wars in which we\r\nhave a preponderance of naval force, but the principles are at least\r\nequally valid when a coalition places us in inferiority. The leading case\r\nis the home campaign of 1782. It was strictly on defensive lines. Our\r\ninformation was that France and Spain intended to end the war with a great\r\ncombined effort against our West Indian islands, and particularly Jamaica.\r\nIt was recognised that the way to meet the threat was to concentrate for\r\noffensive action in the Caribbean Sea everything that was not absolutely\r\nneeded for home defence. Instead, therefore, of trying to be strong enough\r\nto attempt the offensive in both areas, it was decided to make sure of the\r\narea that was most critical. To do this the home fleet had to be reduced so\r\nlow relatively to what the enemy had in European waters that offence was\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nWhile Rodney took the offensive area, Lord Howe was given the other. His\r\ntask was to prevent the coalition obtaining such a command of home waters\r\nas would place our trade and coasts at their mercy, and it was not likely\r\nto prove a light one. We knew that the enemy's plan was to combine their\r\nattack on the West Indies with an attempt to control the North Sea, and\r\npossibly the Straits of Dover, with a Dutch squadron of twelve to fifteen\r\nof the line, while a combined Franco-Spanish fleet of at least forty sail\r\nwould occupy the mouth of the Channel. It was also possible that these two\r\nforces would endeavour to form a junction. In any case the object of the\r\njoint operations would be to paralyse our trade and annoy our coasts, and\r\nthereby force us to neglect the West Indian area and the two Spanish\r\nobjectives, Minorca and Gibraltar. All told we had only about thirty of the\r\nline on the home station, and though a large proportion of these were\r\nthree-deckers, a good many could not be ready for sea till the summer.\r\n\r\nInferior as was the available force, there was no thought of a purely\r\npassive defence. It would not meet the case. Something must be done to\r\ninterfere with the offensive operations of the allies in the West Indies\r\nand against Gibraltar, or they would attain the object of their home\r\ncampaign. It was resolved to effect this by minor counterstrokes on their\r\nline of communications to the utmost limit of our defensive reach. It would\r\nmean a considerable stretch of our concentration, but we were determined to\r\ndo what we could to prevent reinforcements from reaching the West Indies\r\nfrom Brest, to intercept French trade as occasion offered, and, finally, at\r\nalmost any risk to relieve Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nIn these conditions the defensive concentration was based on a central mass\r\nor reserve at Spithead, a squadron in the Downs to watch the Texel for the\r\nsafety of the North Sea trade, and another to the westward to watch Brest\r\nand interrupt its transatlantic communications. Kempenfelt in command of\r\nthe latter squadron had just shown what could be done by his great exploit\r\nof capturing Guichen's convoy of military and naval stores for the West\r\nIndies. Early in the spring he was relieved by Barrington, who sailed on\r\nApril 5th to resume the Ushant position. His instructions were not to fight\r\na superior enemy unless in favourable circumstances, but to retire on\r\nSpithead. He was away three weeks, and returned with a French East India\r\nconvoy with troops and stores, and two of the ships of-the-line which\r\nformed its escort.\r\n\r\nUp to this time there had been no immediate sign of the great movement from\r\nthe south. The Franco-Spanish fleet which had assembled at Cadiz was\r\noccupied ineffectually in trying to stop small reliefs reaching Gibraltar\r\nand in covering their own homeward-bound trade. The Dutch, however, were\r\nbecoming active, and the season was approaching for our Baltic trade to\r\ncome home. Ross in the North Sea had but four of the line to watch the\r\nTexel, and was in no position to deal with the danger. Accordingly early in\r\nMay the weight of the home concentration was thrown into the North Sea. On\r\nthe 10th Howe sailed with Barrington and the bulk of the fleet to join Ross\r\nin the Downs, while Kempenfelt again took the Ushant position. Only about\r\nhalf the Brest Squadron had gone down to join the Spaniards at Cadiz, and\r\nhe was told his first duty was to intercept the rest if it put to sea, but,\r\nas in Barrington's instructions, if he met a superior squadron he was to\r\nretire up Channel under the English coast and join hands with Howe. In\r\nspite of the fact that influenza was now raging in the fleet, he succeeded\r\nin holding the French inactive. Howe with the same difficulty to face was\r\nequally successful. The Dutch had put to sea, but returned immediately they\r\nknew of his movement, and cruising off the Texel, he held them there, and\r\nkept complete command of the North Sea till our Baltic trade was safe home.\r\n\r\nBy the end of May it was done, and as our intelligence indicated that the\r\ngreat movement from Cadiz was at last about to begin, Howe, to whom a\r\ncertain discretion had been left, decided it was time to shift the weight\r\nto his other wing and close on Kempenfelt. The Government, however, seemed\r\nto think that he ought to be able to use his position for offensive\r\noperations against Dutch trade, but in the admiral's opinion this was to\r\nlose hold of the design and sacrifice cohesion too much to reach. He\r\ninformed them that he had not deemed it advisable to make detachments from\r\nhis squadron against the trade, \"not knowing how suddenly there might be a\r\ncall, for the greater part of it at least, to the westward.\" In accordance,\r\ntherefore, with his general instructions he left with Ross a strong\r\nsquadron of nine of the line, sufficient to hold in check, and even \"to\r\ntake and destroy,\" the comparatively weak ships of the Dutch, and with the\r\nrest returned to the westward.[13] His intention was to proceed with all\r\npossible expedition to join Kempenfelt on the coast of France, but this,\r\nowing to the ravages of the influenza, he was unable to do. Kempenfelt was\r\nforced to come in, and on June 5th the junction was made at Spithead.\r\n\r\n  [13] The Dutch were believed to have sixteen of the line--one\r\n  seventy-four, seven sixty-eights, and the rest under sixty guns. In\r\n  Ross's squadron were one three-decker and two eighties.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks, so severe was the epidemic, they could not move. Then came\r\nnews that the Cadiz fleet under Langara had sailed the day Howe had reached\r\nSpithead, and he resolved to make a dash with every ship fit to put to sea\r\nto cut it off from Brest. He was too late. Before he could get into\r\nposition the junction between Langara and the Brest squadron was made, and\r\nin their full force the allies had occupied the mouth of the Channel. With\r\nthe addition of the Brest ships the combined fleet numbered forty of the\r\nline, while all Howe could muster was twenty-two, but amongst them were\r\nseven three-deckers and three eighties, and he would soon be reinforced.\r\nThree of Ross's smallest ships were recalled, and five others were nearly\r\nready, but for these Howe could not wait. The homeward-bound Jamaica convoy\r\nwas at hand, and at all hazards it must be saved.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? So soon as he sighted the enemy he realised that a\r\nsuccessful action was out of the question. Early in the morning of July\r\n12th, \"being fifteen leagues S.S.E. from Scilly,\" Langara with thirty-six\r\nof the line was seen to the westward. \"As soon,\" wrote Howe, \"as their\r\nforce had been ascertained, I thought proper to avoid coming to battle with\r\nthem as then circumstanced, and therefore steered to the north to pass\r\nbetween Scilly and the Land's End. My purpose therein was to get to the\r\nwestward of the enemy, both for protecting the Jamaica convoy and to gain\r\nthe advantage of situation for bringing them to action which the difference\r\nin our numbers renders desirable.\"\r\n\r\nBy a most brilliant effort of seamanship the dangerous movement was\r\neffected safely that night, and it proved an entire success. Till Howe was\r\nmet with and defeated, the allies would not venture into the Channel, and\r\nhis unprecedented feat had effectually thrown them off. Assuming apparently\r\nthat he must have passed round their rear to seaward, they sought him to\r\nthe southward, and there for a month beat up and down in ineffective\r\nsearch. Meanwhile Howe, sending his cruisers ahead to the convoy's\r\nrendezvous off the south-west coast of Iceland, had taken his whole fleet\r\nabout two hundred miles west of the Skelligs to meet it. Northerly winds\r\nprevented his reaching the right latitude in time, but it mattered little.\r\nThe convoy passed in between him and the south of Ireland, and as the enemy\r\nhad taken a cast down to Ushant, it was able to enter the Channel in safety\r\nwithout sighting an enemy's sail. Ignorant of what had happened, Howe\r\ncruised for a week practising the ships \"in connected movements so\r\nparticularly necessary on the present occasion.\" Then with his fleet in\r\nfine condition to carry out preventive tactics in accordance with\r\nKempenfelt's well-known exposition,[14] he returned to seek the enemy to\r\nthe eastward, in order to try to draw them from their station at Scilly and\r\nopen the Channel. On his way he learnt the convoy had passed in, and with\r\nthis anxiety off his mind he bore up for the Lizard, where his\r\nreinforcements were awaiting him. There he found the Channel was free. From\r\nlack of supplies the enemy had been forced to retire to port, and he\r\nreturned to Spithead to make preparations for the relief of Gibraltar.\r\nWhile this work was going on, the North Sea squadron was again strengthened\r\nthat it might resume the blockade of the Texel and cover the arrival of the\r\nautumn convoys from the Baltic. It was done with complete success. Not a\r\nsingle ship fell into the enemy's hands, and the campaign, and indeed the\r\nwar, ended by Howe taking the mass of his force down to Gibraltar and\r\nperforming his remarkable feat of relieving it in the face of the Spanish\r\nsquadron. For the power and reach of a well-designed concentration there\r\ncan be no finer example.\r\n\r\n  [14] See post, pp. 222-24.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we seek from the above and similar examples for principles to\r\nserve as a guide between concentration and division we shall find, firstly,\r\nthis one. The degree of division we shall require is in proportion to the\r\nnumber of naval ports from which the enemy can act against our maritime\r\ninterests and to the extent of coastline along which they are spread. It is\r\na principle which springs from the soul of our old tradition that we must\r\nalways seek, not merely to prevent the enemy striking at our heart, but\r\nalso to strike him the moment he attempts to do anything. We must make of\r\nhis every attempt an opportunity for a counterstroke. The distribution this\r\naim entailed varied greatly with different enemies. In our wars with\r\nFrance, and particularly when Spain and Holland were in alliance with her,\r\nthe number of the ports to be dealt with was very considerable and their\r\ndistribution very wide. In our wars with the Dutch alone, on the other\r\nhand, the number and distribution were comparatively small, and in this\r\ncase our concentration was always close.\r\n\r\nThis measure of distribution, however, will never stand alone.\r\nConcentration will not depend solely upon the number and position of the\r\nenemy's naval ports. It will be modified by the extent to which the lines\r\nof operation starting from those ports traverse our own home waters. The\r\nreason is plain. Whatever the enemy opposed to us, and whatever the nature\r\nof the war, we must always keep a fleet at home. In any circumstances it is\r\nessential for the defence of our home trade terminals, and it is essential\r\nas a central reserve from which divisions can be thrown off to reinforce\r\ndistant terminals and to seize opportunities for counterstrokes. It is \"the\r\nmainspring,\" as Lord Barham put it, \"from which all offensive operations\r\nmust proceed.\" This squadron, then, being permanent and fixed as the\r\nfoundation of our whole system, it is clear that if, as in the case of the\r\nFrench wars, the enemy's lines of operation do not traverse our home\r\nwaters, close concentration upon it will not serve our turn. If, on the\r\nother hand, as in the case of the Dutch wars, the lines do traverse home\r\nwaters, a home concentration is all that is required. Our division will\r\nthen be measured by the amount of our surplus strength, and by the extent\r\nto which we feel able to detach squadrons for offensive action against the\r\nenemy's distant maritime interests without prejudicing our hold on the home\r\nterminals of his lines of operation and our power of striking directly he\r\nmoves. These remarks apply, of course, to the main fleet operations. If\r\nsuch an enemy has distant colonial bases from which he can annoy our trade,\r\nminor concentrations must naturally be arranged in those areas.\r\n\r\nNext we have to note that where the enemy's squadrons are widely\r\ndistributed in numerous bases, we cannot always simplify the problem by\r\nleaving some of them open so as to entice him to concentrate and reduce the\r\nnumber of ports to be watched. For if we do this, we leave the unwatched\r\nsquadrons free for sporadic action. Unless we are sure he intends to\r\nconcentrate with a view to a decisive action, our only means of simplifying\r\nthe situation is to watch every port closely enough to interfere\r\neffectually with sporadic action. Then, sporadic action being denied him,\r\nthe enemy must either do nothing or concentrate.\r\n\r\nThe next principle is flexibility. Concentration should be so arranged that\r\nany two parts may freely cohere, and that all parts may quickly condense\r\ninto a mass at any point in the area of concentration. The object of\r\nholding back from forming the mass is to deny the enemy knowledge of our\r\nactual distribution or its intention at any given moment, and at the same\r\ntime to ensure that it will be adjusted to meet any dangerous movement that\r\nis open to him. Further than this our aim should be not merely to prevent\r\nany part being overpowered by a superior force, but to regard every\r\ndetached squadron as a trap to lure the enemy to destruction. The ideal\r\nconcentration, in short, is an appearance of weakness that covers a reality\r\nof strength.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  PART THREE\r\n\r\n             CONDUCT OF NAVAL WAR\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n                 INTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI. INHERENT DIFFERENCES IN THE\r\nCONDITIONS OF WAR ON LAND AND ON SEA\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to apply the foregoing general principles in a definite\r\nmanner to the conduct of naval war, it is necessary to clear the ground of\r\ncertain obstacles to right judgment. The gradual elucidation of the theory\r\nof war, it must be remembered, has been almost entirely the work of\r\nsoldiers, but so admirable is the work they have done, and so philosophical\r\nthe method they have adopted, that a very natural tendency has arisen to\r\nassume that their broad-based conclusions are of universal application.\r\nThat the leading lines which they have charted are in a certain sense those\r\nwhich must govern all strategy no one will deny. They are the real\r\npioneers, and their methods must be in the main our methods, but what we\r\nhave to remember is that the country we have to travel is radically\r\ndifferent from that in which they acquired their skill.\r\n\r\nA moment's consideration will reveal how far-reaching the differences are.\r\nLet us ask ourselves what are the main ideas around which all the military\r\nlore turns. It may be taken broadly that the general principles are three\r\nin number. Firstly, there is the idea of concentration of force, that is,\r\nthe idea of overthrowing the enemy's main strength by bringing to bear upon\r\nit the utmost accumulation of weight and energy within your means;\r\nsecondly, there is the idea that strategy is mainly a question of definite\r\nlines of communication; and thirdly, there is the idea of concentration of\r\neffort, which means keeping a single eye on the force you wish to overthrow\r\nwithout regard to ulterior objects. Now if we examine the conditions which\r\ngive these principles so firm a footing on land, we shall find that in all\r\nthree cases they differ at sea, and differ materially.\r\n\r\nTake the first, which, in spite of all the deductions we have to make from\r\nit in the case of limited wars, is the dominating one. The pithy maxim\r\nwhich expresses its essence is that our primary objective is the enemy's\r\nmain force. In current naval literature the maxim is applied to the sea in\r\nsome such form as this: \"The primary object of our battle-fleet is to seek\r\nout and destroy that of the enemy.\" On the surface nothing could look\r\nsounder, but what are the conditions which underlie the one and the other?\r\n\r\nThe practical value of the military maxim is based upon the fact that in\r\nland warfare it is always theoretically possible to strike at your enemy's\r\narmy, that is, if you have the strength and spirit to overcome the\r\nobstacles and face the risks. But at sea this is not so. In naval warfare\r\nwe have a far-reaching fact which is entirely unknown on land. It is simply\r\nthis--that it is possible for your enemy to remove his fleet from the board\r\naltogether. He may withdraw it into a defended port, where it is absolutely\r\nout of your reach without the assistance of an army. No amount of naval\r\nforce, and no amount of offensive spirit, can avail you. The result is that\r\nin naval warfare an embarrassing dilemma tends to assert itself. If you are\r\nin a superiority that justifies a vigorous offensive and prompts you to\r\nseek out your enemy with a view to a decision, the chances are you will\r\nfind him in a position where you cannot touch him. Your offence is\r\narrested, and you find yourself in what, at least theoretically, is the\r\nweakest general position known to war.\r\n\r\nThis was one of our earliest discoveries in strategy. It followed indeed\r\nimmediately and inevitably upon our discovery that the most drastic way of\r\nmaking war was to concentrate every effort on the enemy's armed forces. In\r\ndealing with the theory of war in general a caveat has already been entered\r\nagainst the too common assumption that this method was an invention of\r\nNapoleon's or Frederick's, or that it was a foreign importation at all. In\r\nthe view at least of our own military historians the idea was born in our\r\nCivil Wars with Cromwell and the New Model Army. It was the conspicuous\r\nfeature that distinguished our Civil War from all previous wars of modern\r\ntimes. So astonishing was its success--as foreign observers remarked--that\r\nit was naturally applied by our soldier-admirals at sea so soon as war\r\nbroke out with the Dutch. Whatever may be the claims of the Cromwellian\r\nsoldiers to have invented for land warfare what is regarded abroad as the\r\nchief characteristic of the Napoleonic method, it is beyond doubt that they\r\ndeserve the credit of it at sea. All three Dutch wars had a commercial\r\nobject, and yet after the first campaign the general idea never was to make\r\nthe enemy's commerce a primary objective. That place was occupied\r\nthroughout by their battle-fleets, and under Monk and Rupert at least those\r\nobjectives were pursued with a singleness of purpose and a persistent\r\nvehemence that was entirely Napoleonic.\r\n\r\nBut in the later stages of the struggle, when we began to gain a\r\npreponderance, it was found that the method ceased to work. The attempt to\r\nseek the enemy with a view to a decisive action was again and again\r\nfrustrated by his retiring to his own coasts, where either we could not\r\nreach him or his facilities for retreat made a decisive result impossible.\r\nHe assumed, in fact, a defensive attitude with which we were powerless to\r\ndeal, and in the true spirit of defence he sprang out from time to time to\r\ndeal us a counterstroke as he saw his opportunity.\r\n\r\nIt was soon perceived that the only way of dealing with this attitude was\r\nto adopt some means of forcing the enemy to sea and compelling him to\r\nexpose himself to the decision we sought. The most cogent means at hand was\r\nto threaten his commerce. Instead, therefore, of attempting to seek out his\r\nfleet directly, our own would sit upon the fairway of his homeward-bound\r\ntrade, either on the Dogger Bank or elsewhere, thereby setting up a\r\nsituation which it was hoped would cost him either his trade or his\r\nbattle-fleet, or possibly both. Thus in spite of the fact that with our\r\nincreasing preponderance our preoccupation with the idea of battle decision\r\nhad become stronger than ever, we found ourselves forced to fall back upon\r\nsubsidiary operations of an ulterior strategical character. It is a curious\r\nparadox, but it is one that seems inherent in the special feature of naval\r\nwar, which permits the armed force to be removed from the board altogether.\r\n\r\nThe second distinguishing characteristic of naval warfare which relates to\r\nthe communication idea is not so well marked, but it is scarcely less\r\nimportant. It will be recalled that this characteristic is concerned with\r\nlines of communication in so far as they tend to determine lines of\r\noperation. It is a simple question of roads and obstacles. In land warfare\r\nwe can determine with some precision the limits and direction of our\r\nenemy's possible movements. We know that they must be determined mainly by\r\nroads and obstacles. But afloat neither roads nor obstacles exist. There is\r\nnothing of the kind on the face of the sea to assist us in locating him and\r\ndetermining his movements. True it is that in sailing days his movements\r\nwere to some extent limited by prevailing winds and by the elimination of\r\nimpossible courses, but with steam even these determinants have gone, and\r\nthere is practically nothing to limit the freedom of his movement except\r\nthe exigencies of fuel. Consequently in seeking to strike our enemy the\r\nliability to miss him is much greater at sea than on land, and the chances\r\nof being eluded by the enemy whom we are seeking to bring to battle become\r\nso serious a check upon our offensive action as to compel us to handle the\r\nmaxim of \"Seeking out the enemy's fleet\" with caution.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty obtruded itself from the moment the idea was born. It may be\r\ntraced back--so far at least as modern warfare is concerned--to Sir Francis\r\nDrake's famous appreciation in the year of the Armada. This memorable\r\ndespatch was written when an acute difference of opinion had arisen as to\r\nwhether it were better to hold our fleet back in home waters or to send it\r\nforward to the coast of Spain. The enemy's objective was very uncertain. We\r\ncould not tell whether the blow was to fall in the Channel or Ireland or\r\nScotland, and the situation was complicated by a Spanish army of invasion\r\nready to cross from the Flemish coast, and the possibility of combined\r\naction by the Guises from France. Drake was for solving the problem by\r\ntaking station off the Armada's port of departure, and fully aware of the\r\nrisk such a move entailed, he fortified his purely strategical reasons with\r\nmoral considerations of the highest moment. But the Government was\r\nunconvinced, not as is usually assumed out of sheer pusillanimity and lack\r\nof strategical insight, but because the chances of Drake's missing contact\r\nwere too great if the Armada should sail before our own fleet could get\r\ninto position.\r\n\r\nOur third elementary principle is the idea of concentration of effort, and\r\nthe third characteristic of naval warfare which clashes with it is that\r\nover and above the duty of winning battles, fleets are charged with the\r\nduty of protecting commerce. In land warfare, at least since laying waste\r\nan undefended part of your enemy's country ceased to be a recognised\r\nstrategical operation, there is no corresponding deflection of purely\r\nmilitary operations. It is idle for purists to tell us that the deflection\r\nof commerce protection should not be permitted to turn us from our main\r\npurpose. We have to do with the hard facts of war, and experience tells us\r\nthat for economic reasons alone, apart from the pressure of public opinion,\r\nno one has ever found it possible to ignore the deflection entirely. So\r\nvital indeed is financial vigour in war, that more often than not the\r\nmaintenance of the flow of trade has been felt as a paramount\r\nconsideration. Even in the best days of our Dutch wars, when the whole plan\r\nwas based on ignoring the enemy's commerce as an objective, we found\r\nourselves at times forced to protect our own trade with seriously\r\ndisturbing results.\r\n\r\nNor is it more profitable to declare that the only sound way to protect\r\nyour commerce is to destroy the enemy's fleet. As an enunciation of a\r\nprinciple it is a truism--no one would dispute it. As a canon of practical\r\nstrategy, it is untrue; for here our first deflection again asserts itself.\r\nWhat are you to do if the enemy refuses to permit you to destroy his\r\nfleets? You cannot leave your trade exposed to squadronal or cruiser raids\r\nwhile you await your opportunity, and the more you concentrate your force\r\nand efforts to secure the desired decision, the more you will expose your\r\ntrade to sporadic attack. The result is that you are not always free to\r\nadopt the plan which is best calculated to bring your enemy to a decision.\r\nYou may find yourself compelled to occupy, not the best positions, but\r\nthose which will give a fair chance of getting contact in favourable\r\nconditions, and at the same time afford reasonable cover for your trade.\r\nHence the maxim that the enemy's coast should be our frontier. It is not a\r\npurely military maxim like that for seeking out the enemy's fleet, though\r\nthe two are often used as though they were interchangeable. Our usual\r\npositions on the enemy's coast were dictated quite as much by the\r\nexigencies of commerce protection as by primary strategical reasons. To\r\nmaintain a rigorous watch close off the enemy's ports was never the\r\nlikeliest way to bring him to decisive action--we have Nelson's well-known\r\ndeclaration on the point--but it was the best way, and often the only way,\r\nto keep the sea clear for the passage of our own trade and for the\r\noperations of our cruisers against that of the enemy.\r\n\r\nFor the present these all-important points need not be elaborated further.\r\nAs we proceed to deal with the methods of naval warfare they will gather\r\nforce and lucidity. Enough has been said to mark the shoals and warn us\r\nthat, admirably constructed as is the craft which the military strategists\r\nhave provided for our use, we must be careful with our navigation.\r\n\r\nBut before proceeding further it is necessary to simplify what lies before\r\nus by endeavouring to group the complex variety of naval operations into\r\nmanageable shape.\r\n\r\nII. TYPICAL FORMS OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of naval war all operations will be found to relate to two\r\nbroad classes of object. The one is to obtain or dispute the command of the\r\nsea, and the other to exercise such control of communications as we have,\r\nwhether the complete command has been secured or not.\r\n\r\nIt was on the logical and practical distinction between these two kinds of\r\nnaval object, as we have seen, that the constitution of fleets was based in\r\nthe fulness of the sailing period, when maritime wars were nearly incessant\r\nand were shaping the existing distribution of power in the world. During\r\nthat period at any rate the dual conception lay at the root of naval\r\nmethods and naval policy, and as it is also the logical outcome of the\r\ntheory of war, we may safely take it as the basis of our analysis of the\r\nconduct of naval operations.\r\n\r\nPractically, of course, we can seldom assert categorically that any\r\noperation of war has but one clearly defined object. A battle-squadron\r\nwhose primary function was to secure command was often so placed as to\r\nenable it to exercise control; and, _vice versa_, cruiser lines intended\r\nprimarily to exercise control upon the trade routes were regarded as\r\noutposts of the battle-fleet to give it warning of the movements of hostile\r\nsquadrons. Thus Cornwallis during his blockade of Brest had sometimes to\r\nloosen his hold in order to cover the arrival of convoys against raiding\r\nsquadrons; and thus also when Nelson was asked by Lord Barham for his views\r\non cruiser patrol lines, he expressed himself as follows: \"Ships on this\r\nservice would not only prevent the depredations of privateers, but be in\r\nthe way to watch any squadron of the enemy should they pass on their\r\ntrack.... Therefore intelligence will be quickly conveyed, and the enemy\r\nnever, I think, lost sight of.\"[15] Instructions in this sense were issued\r\nby Lord Barham to the commodores concerned. In both cases, it will be seen,\r\nthe two classes of operation overlapped. Still for purposes of analysis the\r\ndistinction holds good, and is valuable for obtaining a clear view of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n  [15] Nelson to Barham, 29 August 1805.\r\n\r\nTake, first, the methods of securing command, by which we mean putting it\r\nout of the enemy's power to use effectually the common communications or\r\nmaterially to interfere with our use of them. We find the means employed\r\nwere two: decision by battle, and blockade. Of the two, the first was the\r\nless frequently attainable, but it was the one the British service always\r\npreferred. It was only natural that it should be so, seeing that our normal\r\nposition was one of preponderance over our enemy, and so long as the policy\r\nof preponderance is maintained, the chances are the preference will also be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nBut further than this, the idea seems to be rooted in the oldest traditions\r\nof the Royal Navy. As we have seen, the conviction of the sea service that\r\nwar is primarily a question of battles, and that battles once joined on\r\nanything like equal terms must be pressed to the last gasp, is one that has\r\nhad nothing to learn from more recent continental discoveries. The\r\nCromwellian admirals handed down to us the memory of battles lasting three,\r\nand even four, days. Their creed is enshrined in the robust article of war\r\nunder which Byng and Calder were condemned; and in the apotheosis of Nelson\r\nthe service has deified the battle idea.\r\n\r\nIt is true there were periods when the idea seemed to have lost its colour,\r\nbut nevertheless it is so firmly embedded in the British conception of\r\nnaval warfare, that there would be nothing left to say but for the\r\nunavoidable modification with which we have to temper the doctrine of\r\noverthrow. \"Use that means,\" said its best-known advocate, \"when you can\r\nand when you must.\" Devoutly as we may hold the battle faith, it is not\r\nalways possible or wise to act upon it. If we are strong, we press to the\r\nissue of battle when we can. If we are weak, we do not accept the issue\r\nunless we must. If circumstances are advantageous to us, we are not always\r\nable to effect a decision; and if they are disadvantageous, we are not\r\nalways obliged to fight. Hence we find the apparently simple doctrine of\r\nthe battle was almost always entangled in two of the most difficult\r\nproblems that beset our old admirals. The most thorny questions they had to\r\ndecide were these. In the normal case of strength, it was not how to defeat\r\nthe enemy, but how to bring him to action; and in casual cases of temporary\r\nweakness, it was not how to sell your life dearly, but how to maintain the\r\nfleet actively on the defensive so as at once to deny the enemy the\r\ndecision he sought and to prevent his attaining his ulterior object.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it follows that we are able to group all naval\r\noperations in some such way as this. Firstly, on the only assumption we can\r\npermit ourselves, namely, that we start with a preponderance of force or\r\nadvantage, we adopt methods for securing command. These methods, again,\r\nfall under two heads. Firstly, there are operations for securing a decision\r\nby battle, under which head, as has been explained, we shall be chiefly\r\nconcerned with methods of bringing an unwilling enemy to action, and with\r\nthe value to that end of the maxim of \"Seeking out the enemy's fleet.\"\r\nSecondly, there are the operations which become necessary when no decision\r\nis obtainable and our war plan demands the immediate control of\r\ncommunications. Under this head it will be convenient to treat all forms of\r\nblockade, whether military or commercial, although, as we shall see,\r\ncertain forms of military, and even commercial, blockade are primarily\r\nconcerned with forcing the enemy to a decision.\r\n\r\nOur second main group covers operations to which we have to resort when our\r\nrelative strength is not adequate for either class of operations to secure\r\ncommand. In these conditions we have to content ourselves with endeavouring\r\nto hold the command in dispute; that is, we endeavour by active defensive\r\noperations to prevent the enemy either securing or exercising control for\r\nthe objects he has in view. Such are the operations which are connoted by\r\nthe true conception of \"A fleet in being.\" Under this head also should fall\r\nthose new forms of minor counter-attack which have entered the field of\r\nstrategy since the introduction of the mobile torpedo and offensive mining.\r\n\r\nIn the third main group we have to deal with the methods of exercising\r\ncontrol of passage and communication. These operations vary in character\r\naccording to the several purposes for which the control is desired, and\r\nthey will be found to take one of three general forms. Firstly, the control\r\nof the lines of passage of an invading army; secondly, the control of trade\r\nroutes and trade terminals for the attack and defence of commerce; and\r\nthirdly, the control of passage and communication for our own oversea\r\nexpeditions, and the control of their objective area for the active support\r\nof their operations.\r\n\r\nFor clearness we may summarise the whole in tabulated analysis, thus:--\r\n\r\n  1. Methods of securing command:\r\n    (a) By obtaining a decision.\r\n    (b) By blockade.\r\n  2. Methods of disputing command:\r\n    (a) Principle of \"the fleet in being.\"\r\n    (b) Minor counter-attacks.\r\n  3. Methods of exercising command:\r\n    (a) Defence against invasion.\r\n    (b) Attack and defence of commerce.\r\n    (c) Attack, defence, and support of military expeditions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n          METHODS OF SECURING COMMAND\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI. ON OBTAINING A DECISION\r\n\r\nWhatever the nature of the war in which we are engaged, whether it be\r\nlimited or unlimited, permanent and general command of the sea is the\r\ncondition of ultimate success. The only way of securing such a command by\r\nnaval means is to obtain a decision by battle against the enemy's fleet.\r\nSooner or later it must be done, and the sooner the better. That was the\r\nold British creed. It is still our creed, and needs no labouring. No one\r\nwill dispute it, no one will care even to discuss it, and we pass with\r\nconfidence to the conclusion that the first business of our fleet is to\r\nseek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it.\r\n\r\nNo maxim can so well embody the British spirit of making war upon the sea,\r\nand nothing must be permitted to breathe on that spirit. To examine its\r\nclaim to be the logical conclusion of our theory of war will even be held\r\ndangerous, yet nothing is so dangerous in the study of war as to permit\r\nmaxims to become a substitute for judgment. Let us examine its credentials,\r\nand as a first step put it to the test of the two most modern instances.\r\n\r\nBoth of them, it must be noted, were instances of Limited War, the most\r\nusual form of our own activities, and indeed the only one to which our war\r\norganisation, with its essential preponderance of the naval element, has\r\never been really adapted. The first instance is the Spanish-American War,\r\nand the second that between Russia and Japan.\r\n\r\nIn the former case the Americans took up arms in order to liberate Cuba\r\nfrom Spanish domination--a strictly limited object. There is no evidence\r\nthat the nature of the war was ever clearly formulated by either side, but\r\nin just conformity with the general political conditions the American war\r\nplan aimed at opening with a movement to secure the territorial object. At\r\nthe earliest possible moment they intended to establish themselves in the\r\nwest of Cuba in support of the Colonial insurgents. Everything depended on\r\nthe initiative being seized with decision and rapidity. Its moral and\r\nphysical importance justified the utmost risk, and such was the\r\nconformation of the sea which the American army had to pass, that a\r\nstrictly defensive or covering attitude with their fleet could reduce the\r\nrisk almost to security. Yet so unwisely dominated were the Americans by\r\nrecently rediscovered maxims, that when on the eve of executing the vital\r\nmovement they heard a Spanish squadron was crossing the Atlantic, their own\r\ncovering force was diverted from its defensive position and sent away to\r\n\"seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it.\"\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico was the most obvious point at which to seek it, and thither\r\nAdmiral Sampson was permitted to go, regardless of the elementary truth\r\nthat in such cases what is obvious to you is also usually obvious to your\r\nenemy. The result was that not only did the Americans fail to get contact,\r\nbut they also uncovered their own army's line of passage and paralysed the\r\ninitial movement. In the end it was only pure chance that permitted them to\r\nretrieve the mistake they had made. Had the Spanish squadron put into a\r\nCuban port in railway communication with the main Royalist army, such as\r\nCienfuegos or Havana, instead of hurrying into Santiago, the whole campaign\r\nmust have been lost. \"It appears now,\" wrote Admiral Mahan, in his _Lessons\r\nof the War with Spain_, \"not only that the eastward voyage of our Havana\r\ndivision was unfortunate, but it should have been seen beforehand to be a\r\nmistake, because inconsistent with a well and generally accepted principle\r\nof war, the non-observance of which was not commanded by the conditions.\r\nThe principle is that which condemns eccentric movements. By the disregard\r\nof rule in this case we uncovered both Havana and Cienfuegos, which it was\r\nour object to close to the enemy's division.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not we regard Admiral Mahan's exposition of the error as\r\npenetrating to the real principle that was violated, the movement was in\r\nfact not only eccentric, but unnecessary. Had the Americans been content to\r\nkeep their fleet concentrated in its true defensive position, not only\r\nwould they have covered their army's line of passage and their blockade of\r\nthe territorial objective, but they would have had a far better chance of\r\nbringing the Spaniards to action. The Spaniards were bound to come to them\r\nor remain outside the theatre of operations where they could in no way\r\naffect the issue of the war except adversely to themselves by sapping the\r\nspirit of their own Cuban garrison. It is a clear case of the letter\r\nkilling the spirit, of an attractive maxim being permitted to shut the door\r\nupon judgment. Strategical offence in this case was not the best defence.\r\n\"Seeking out the enemy's fleet\" was almost bound to end in a blow in the\r\nair, which not only would fail to gain any offensive result, but would\r\nsacrifice the main defensive plank in the American war plan upon which\r\ntheir offensive relied for success. To stigmatise such a movement as merely\r\neccentric is to pass very lenient censure.\r\n\r\nIn the Russo-Japanese War we have a converse case, in which judgment kept\r\nthe aphorism silent. It is true that during the earlier stage of the naval\r\noperations the Japanese did in a sense seek out the enemy's fleet, in so\r\nfar as they advanced their base close to Port Arthur; but this was done,\r\nnot with any fixed intention of destroying the Russian fleet--there was\r\nsmall hope of that at sea--but rather because by no other means could they\r\ncover the army's lines of passage, which it was the function of the fleet\r\nto secure, the true offensive operations being on land. Never except once,\r\nunder express orders from Tokio, did either Admiral Togo or Admiral\r\nKamimura press offensive movements in such a way as to jeopardise the\r\npreventive duty with which the war plan charged them. Still less in the\r\nlater stage, when everything depended on the destruction of the Baltic\r\nfleet, did Admiral Togo \"seek it out.\" He was content, as the Americans\r\nshould have been content, to have set up such a situation that the enemy\r\nmust come and break it down if they were to affect the issue of the war. So\r\nhe waited on the defensive, assured his enemy must come to him, and thereby\r\nhe rendered it, as certain as war can be, that when the moment for the\r\ntactical offensive came his blow should be sure and sudden, in overwhelming\r\nstrength of concentration, and decisive beyond all precedent.\r\n\r\nClearly, then, the maxim of \"seeking out\" for all its moral exhilaration,\r\nfor all its value as an expression of high and sound naval spirit, must not\r\nbe permitted to displace well-reasoned judgment. Trusty servant as it is,\r\nit will make a bad master, as the Americans found to their serious\r\njeopardy. Yet we feel instinctively that it expresses, as no other aphorism\r\ndoes, the secret of British success at sea. We cannot do without it; we\r\ncannot do with it in its nakedness. Let us endeavour to clothe it with its\r\nreal meaning, with the true principles that it connotes. Let us endeavour\r\nto determine the stuff that it is made of, and for this purpose there is no\r\nbetter way than to trace its gradual growth from the days when it was born\r\nof the crude and virile instinct of the earliest masters.\r\n\r\nThe germ is to be found in the despatch already mentioned which Drake wrote\r\nfrom Plymouth at the end of March in 1588. His arguments were not purely\r\nnaval, for it was a combined problem, a problem of defence against\r\ninvasion, that had to be solved. What he wished to persuade the Government\r\nwas, that the kernel of the situation was not so much Parma's army of\r\ninvasion in Flanders, as the fleet that was preparing in Spain to clear its\r\npassage. The Government appeared to be acting on the opposite view. Howard\r\nwith the bulk of the fleet was at the base in the Medway within supporting\r\ndistance of the light squadron that was blockading the Flemish ports in\r\nconcert with the Dutch. Drake himself with another light squadron had been\r\nsent to the westward with some indeterminate idea of his serving as an\r\nobservation squadron, or being used in the mediaeval fashion for an\r\neccentric counterstroke. Being invited to give his opinion on this\r\ndisposition, he pronounced it vicious. In his eyes, what was demanded was\r\nan offensive movement against the enemy's main fleet. \"If there may be such\r\na stay or stop made,\" he urged, \"by any means of this fleet in Spain, so\r\nthat they may not come through the seas as conquerors, then shall the\r\nPrince of Parma have such a check thereby as were meet.\" What he had in his\r\nmind is clearly not so much a decision in the open as an interruption of\r\nthe enemy's incomplete mobilisation, such as he had so brilliantly effected\r\nthe previous year. For later on he says that \"Next under God's mighty\r\nprotection the advantage of time and place will be the only and chief means\r\nfor our good, wherein I most humbly beseech your good lordships to\r\npersevere as you have begun, for with fifty sail of shipping we shall do\r\nmore upon their own coast than a great many more will do here at home; and\r\nthe sooner we are gone, the better we shall be able to impeach them.\" He\r\ndoes not say \"destroy.\" \"Impeach\" meant \"to prevent.\"\r\n\r\nClearly, then, what he had in his mind was a repetition of the previous\r\nyear's strategy, whereby he had been able to break up the Spanish\r\nmobilisation and \"impeach\" the Armada from sailing. He did not even ask for\r\na concentration of the whole fleet for the purpose, but only that his own\r\nsquadron should be reinforced as was thought convenient. The actual reasons\r\nhe gave for his advice were purely moral--that is, he dwelt on the\r\nenheartening effect of striking the first blow, and attacking instead of\r\nwaiting to be attacked. The nation, he urged, \"will be persuaded that the\r\nLord will put into Her Majesty and her people courage and boldness not to\r\nfear invasion, but to seek God's enemies and Her Majesty's where they may\r\nbe found.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the germ of the maxim. The consequence of his despatch was a\r\nsummons to attend the Council. The conference was followed, not by the half\r\nmeasure, which was all he had ventured to advise in his despatch, but by\r\nsomething that embodied a fuller expression of his general idea, and\r\nclosely resembled what was to be consecrated as our regular disposition in\r\nsuch cases. The whole of the main fleet, except the squadron watching the\r\nFlemish coast, was massed to the westward to cover the blockade of Parma's\r\ntransports, but the position assigned to it was inside the Channel instead\r\nof outside, which tactically was bad, for it was almost certain to give the\r\nArmada the weather gage. No movement to the coast of Spain was\r\npermitted--not necessarily, be it remembered, out of pusillanimity or\r\nfailure to grasp Drake's idea, but for fear that, as in the recent American\r\ncase, a forward movement was likely to result in a blow in the air, and to\r\nuncover the vital position without bringing the enemy to action.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the sailing of the Armada was so long delayed Drake's\r\nimportunity was renewed, with that of Howard and all his colleagues to back\r\nit. It brought eventually the desired permission. The fleet sailed for\r\nCoruña, where it was known the Armada, after an abortive start from Lisbon,\r\nhad been driven by bad weather, and something like what the Government\r\nfeared happened. Before it could reach its destination it met southerly\r\ngales, its offensive power was exhausted, and it had to return to Plymouth\r\nimpotent for immediate action as the Armada finally sailed. When the\r\nSpaniards appeared it was still in port refitting and victualling. It was\r\nonly by an unprecedented feat of seamanship that the situation was saved,\r\nand Howard was able to gain the orthodox position to seaward of his enemy.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, the Government's cautious clinging to a general defensive\r\nattitude, instead of seeking out the enemy's fleet, was justified, but it\r\nmust be remembered that Drake from the first had insisted it was a question\r\nof time as well as place. If he had been permitted to make the movement\r\nwhen he first proposed it, there is good reason to believe that the final\r\nstages of the Spanish mobilisation could not have been carried out that\r\nyear; that is to say, the various divisions of the Armada could not have\r\nbeen assembled into a fleet. But information as to its condition was at the\r\ntime very uncertain, and in view of the negotiations that were on foot,\r\nthere were, moreover, high political reasons for our not taking too drastic\r\nan offensive if a reasonable alternative existed.\r\n\r\nThe principles, then, which we distil from this, the original case of\r\n\"seeking out,\" are, firstly, the moral value of seizing the initiative,\r\nand, secondly, the importance of striking before the enemy's mobilisation\r\nis complete. The idea of overthrow by a great fleet action is not present,\r\nunless we find it in a not clearly formulated idea of the Elizabethan\r\nadmirals of striking a fleet when it is demoralised, as the Armada was by\r\nits first rebuff, or immediately on its leaving port before it had settled\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIn our next naval struggle with the Dutch in the latter half of the\r\nseventeenth century the principle of overthrow, as we have seen, became\r\nfully developed. It was the keynote of the strategy which was evolved, and\r\nthe conditions which forced it to recognition also emphasised the\r\nprinciples of seeking out and destroying. It was a case of a purely naval\r\nstruggle, in which there were no military considerations to deflect naval\r\nstrategy. It was, moreover, a question of narrow seas, and the risk of\r\nmissing contact which had cramped the Elizabethans in their oceanic theatre\r\nwas a negligible factor. Yet fresh objections to using the \"seeking out\"\r\nmaxim as a strategical panacea soon declared themselves.\r\n\r\nThe first war opened without any trace of the new principle. The first\r\ncampaign was concerned in the old fashion entirely with the attack and\r\ndefence of trade, and such indecisive actions as occurred were merely\r\nincidental to the process. No one appears to have realised the fallacy of\r\nsuch method except, perhaps, Tromp. The general instructions he received\r\nwere that \"the first and principal object was to do all possible harm to\r\nthe English,\" and to that end \"he was given a fleet in order to sail to the\r\ndamage and offence of the English fleet, and also to give convoy to the\r\nwest.\" Seeing at once the incompatibility of the two functions, he asked\r\nfor more definite instructions. What, for instance, was he to do if he\r\nfound a chance of blockading the main English fleet at its base? Was he to\r\ndevote himself to the blockade and \"leave the whole fleet of merchantmen to\r\nbe a prey to a squadron of fast-sailing frigates,\" or was he to continue\r\nhis escort duty? Full as he was of desire to deal with the enemy's main\r\nfleet, he was perplexed with the practical difficulty--too often\r\nforgotten--that the mere domination of the enemy's battle strength does not\r\nsolve the problem of control of the sea. No fresh instructions were\r\nforthcoming to clear his perplexity, and he could only protest again. \"I\r\ncould wish,\" he wrote, \"to be so fortunate as to have only one of these two\r\nduties--to seek out the enemy, or to give convoy, for to do both is\r\nattended with great difficulties.\"\r\n\r\nThe indecisive campaign which naturally resulted from this lack of\r\nstrategical grip and concentration of effort came to an end with Tromp's\r\npartial defeat of Blake off Dungeness on 30th November 1652. Though charged\r\nin spite of his protests with a vast convoy, the Dutch admiral had sent it\r\nback to Ostend when he found Blake was in the Downs, and then, free from\r\nall preoccupation, he had gone to seek out his enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was the effect which this unexpected blow had upon the strong military\r\ninsight of the Cromwellian Government that led to those famous reforms\r\nwhich made this winter so memorable a landmark in British naval history.\r\nMonk, the most finished professional soldier in the English service, and\r\nDeane, another general, were joined in the command with Blake, and with\r\ntheir coming was breathed into the sea service the high military spirit of\r\nthe New Model Army. To that winter we owe not only the Articles of War,\r\nwhich made discipline possible, and the first attempt to formulate Fighting\r\nInstructions, in which a regular tactical system was conceived, but also\r\ntwo other conceptions that go to make up the modern idea of naval warfare.\r\nOne was the conviction that war upon the sea meant operations against the\r\nenemy's armed fleets in order to destroy his power of naval resistance as\r\ndistinguished from operations by way of reprisal against his trade; and the\r\nother, that such warfare required for its effective use a fleet of\r\nState-owned ships specialised for war, with as little assistance as\r\npossible from private-owned ships. It was not unnatural that all four ideas\r\nshould have taken shape together, so closely are they related. The end\r\nconnotes the means. Discipline, fleet tactics, and a navy of warships were\r\nindispensable for making war in the modern sense of the term.\r\n\r\nThe results were seen in the three great actions of the following spring,\r\nthe first under the three Generals, and the other two under Monk alone. In\r\nthe last, he carried the new ideas so far as to forbid taking possession of\r\ndisabled vessels, that nothing might check the work of destruction. All\r\nwere to be sunk with as much tenderness for human life as destruction would\r\npermit. In like manner the second war was characterised by three great\r\nnaval actions, one of which, after Monk had resumed command, lasted no less\r\nthan four days. The new doctrine was indeed carried to exaggeration. So\r\nentirely was naval thought centred on the action of the battle-fleets, that\r\nno provision was made for an adequate exercise of control. In our own case\r\nat least, massing for offensive action was pressed so far that no thought\r\nwas given to sustaining it by reliefs. Consequently our offensive power\r\nsuffered periods of exhaustion when the fleet had to return to its base,\r\nand the Dutch were left sufficient freedom not only to secure their own\r\ntrade, but to strike severely at ours. Their counterstrokes culminated in\r\nthe famous attack upon Sheerness and Chatham. That such an opportunity was\r\nallowed them can be traced directly to an exaggeration of the new doctrine.\r\nIn the belief of the British Government the \"St. James's Fight\"--the last\r\nof the three actions--had settled the question of command. Negotiations for\r\npeace were opened, and they were content to reap the fruit of the great\r\nbattles in preying on Dutch trade. Having done its work, as was believed,\r\nthe bulk of the battle-fleet for financial reasons was laid up, and the\r\nDutch seized the opportunity to demonstrate the limitations of the abused\r\ndoctrine. The lesson is one we have never forgotten, but its value is half\r\nlost if we attribute the disaster to lack of grasp of the battle-fleet\r\ndoctrine rather than to an exaggeration of its possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that we had not obtained a victory sufficiently decisive to\r\ndestroy the enemy's fleet. The most valuable lesson of the war was that\r\nsuch victories required working for, and particularly in cases where the\r\nbelligerents face each other from either side of a narrow sea. In such\r\nconditions it was proved that owing to the facility of retreat and the\r\nrestricted possibilities of pursuit a complete decision is not to be looked\r\nfor without very special strategical preparation. The new doctrine in fact\r\ngave that new direction to strategy which has been already referred to. It\r\nwas no longer a question of whether to make the enemy's trade or his fleet\r\nthe primary objective, but of how to get contact with his fleet in such a\r\nway as to lead to decisive action. Merely to seek him out on his own coasts\r\nwas to ensure that no decisive action would take place. Measures had to be\r\ntaken to force him to sea away from his own bases. The favourite device was\r\nto substitute organised strategical operations against his trade in place\r\nof the old sporadic attacks; that is, the fleet took a position calculated\r\nto stop his trade altogether, not on his own coasts, but far to sea in the\r\nmain fairway. The operations failed for lack of provision for enabling the\r\nfleet by systematic relief to retain its position, but nevertheless it was\r\nthe germ of the system which afterwards, under riper organisation, was to\r\nprove so effective, and to produce such actions as the \"Glorious First of\r\nJune.\"\r\n\r\nIn the third war, after this device had failed again and again, a new one\r\nwas tried. It was Charles the Second's own conception. His idea was to use\r\nthe threat of a military expedition. Some 15,000 men in transports were\r\nbrought to Yarmouth in the hope that the Dutch would come out to bar their\r\npassage across the open North Sea, and would thus permit our fleet to cut\r\nin behind them. There was, however, no proper coordination of the two\r\nforces, and the project failed.\r\n\r\nThis method of securing a decision was not lost sight of; Anson tried to\r\nuse it in the Seven Years' War. For two years every attempt to seek out the\r\nenemy's fleet had led to nothing but the exhaustion of our own. But when\r\nPitt began his raids on the French coast, Anson, who had little faith in\r\ntheir value for military purposes, thought he saw in them definite naval\r\npossibilities. Accordingly when, in 1758, he was placed in command of the\r\nChannel Fleet to cover the expedition against St. Malo, he raised the\r\nblockade of Brest, and took up a position near the Isle of Batz between the\r\nenemy's main fleet and the army's line of passage. The Brest fleet,\r\nhowever, was in no condition to move, and again there was no result. It was\r\nnot till 1805 that there was any clear case of the device succeeding, and\r\nthen it was not used deliberately. It was a joint Anglo-Russian expedition\r\nin the Mediterranean that forced from Napoleon his reckless order for\r\nVilleneuve to put to sea from Cadiz, and so solved the problem out of which\r\nNelson had seen no issue. Lissa may be taken as an analogous case. But\r\nthere the Italians, treating the territorial attack as a real attack\r\ninstead of as a strategical device, suffered themselves to be surprised by\r\nthe Austrian fleet and defeated.\r\n\r\nThis instance serves well to introduce the important fact, that although\r\nour own military expeditions have seldom succeeded in leading to a naval\r\ndecision, the converse was almost always true. The attempt of the enemy to\r\nuse his army against our territory has been the most fertile source of our\r\ngreat naval victories. The knowledge that our enemy intends to invade these\r\nshores, or to make some serious expedition against our oversea dominions or\r\ninterests, should always be welcomed. Unless History belie herself, we know\r\nthat such attempts are the surest means of securing what we want. We have\r\nthe memories of La Hogue, Quiberon, and the Nile to assure us that sooner\r\nor later they must lead to a naval decision, and the chance of a real\r\ndecision is all we can ask of the Fortune of War.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to show that \"seeking out the enemy's fleet\" is\r\nnot in itself sufficient to secure such a decision. What the maxim really\r\nmeans is that we should endeavour from the first to secure contact in the\r\nbest position for bringing about a complete decision in our favour, and as\r\nsoon as the other parts of our war plan, military or political, will\r\npermit. If the main offensive is military, as it was in the Japanese and\r\nAmerican cases, then if possible the effort to secure such control must be\r\nsubordinated to the movement of the army, otherwise we give the defensive\r\nprecedence of the offensive. If, however, the military offensive cannot be\r\nensured until the naval defensive is perfected, as will be the case if the\r\nenemy brings a fleet up to our army's line of passage, then our first move\r\nmust be to secure naval contact.\r\n\r\nThe vice of the opposite method of procedure is obvious. If we assume the\r\nmaxim that the first duty of our fleet is to seek out the enemy wherever he\r\nmay be, it means in its nakedness that we merely conform to the enemy's\r\ndispositions and movements. It is open to him to lead us wherever he likes.\r\nIt was one of the fallacies that underlay all Napoleon's naval\r\ncombinations, that he believed that our hard-bitten admirals would behave\r\nin this guileless manner. But nothing was further from their cunning. There\r\nis a typical order of Cornwallis's which serves well to mark their\r\nattitude. It was one he gave to Admiral Cotton, his second in command, in\r\nJuly 1804 on handing over to his charge the Western Squadron off Ushant:\r\n\"If the French put to sea,\" he says, \"without any of your vessels seeing\r\nthem, do not follow them, unless you are absolutely sure of the course they\r\nhave taken. If you leave the entrance of the Channel without protection,\r\nthe enemy might profit by it, and assist the invasion which threatens His\r\nMajesty's dominions, the protection of which is your principal object.\"\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a common belief that Nelson never permitted himself but a\r\nsingle purpose, the pursuit of the enemy's fleet, and that, ignoring the\r\ncaution which Cornwallis impressed upon Cotton, he fell into the simple\r\ntrap. But it has to be noted that he never suffered himself to be led in\r\npursuit of a fleet away from the position he had been charged to maintain,\r\nunless and until he had made that position secure behind him. His famous\r\nchase to the West Indies is the case which has led to most misconception on\r\nthe point from an insufficient regard to the surrounding circumstances.\r\nNelson did not pursue Villeneuve with the sole, or even the primary, object\r\nof bringing him to action. His dominant object was to save Jamaica from\r\ncapture. If it had only been a question of getting contact, he would\r\ncertainly have felt in a surer position by waiting for Villeneuve's return\r\noff St. Vincent or closing in to the strategical centre off Ushant.\r\nFurther, it must be observed that Nelson by his pursuit did not uncover\r\nwhat it was his duty to defend. The Mediterranean position was rendered\r\nquite secure before he ventured on his eccentric movement. Finally, we have\r\nthe important fact that though the moral effect of Nelson's implacable\r\npersistence and rapidity was of priceless value, it is impossible to show\r\nthat as a mere strategical movement it had any influence on the course of\r\nthe campaign. His appearance in the West Indies may have saved one or two\r\nsmall islands from ransom and a good deal of trade from capture. It may\r\nalso have hastened Villeneuve's return by a few days, but that was not to\r\nour advantage. Had he returned even a week later there would have been no\r\nneed to raise the Rochefort blockade. Barham would have had enough ships at\r\nhis command to preserve the whole of his blockades, as he had intended to\r\ndo till the _Curieux's_ news of Villeneuve's precipitate return forced his\r\nhand before he was ready.\r\n\r\nIf we desire a typical example of the way the old masters used the doctrine\r\nof seeking out, it is to be found, not in Nelson's magnificent chase, but\r\nin the restrained boldness of Barham's orders to Cornwallis and Calder.\r\nTheir instructions for seeking out Villeneuve were to move out on his two\r\npossible lines of approach for such a time and such a distance as would\r\nmake decisive action almost certain, and at the same time, if contact were\r\nmissed, would ensure the preservation of the vital defensive positions.\r\nBarham was far too astute to play into Napoleon's hands, and by blindly\r\nfollowing his enemy's lead to be jockeyed into sacrificing the position\r\nwhich his enemy wished to secure. If our maxim be suffered to usurp the\r\nplace of instructed judgment, the almost inevitable result will be that it\r\nwill lead us into just the kind of mistake which Barham avoided.\r\n\r\nII. BLOCKADE\r\n\r\nUnder the term blockade we include operations which vary widely in\r\ncharacter and in strategical intention. In the first place, blockade may be\r\neither naval or commercial. By naval blockade we seek either to prevent an\r\nenemy's armed force leaving port, or to make certain it shall be brought to\r\naction before it can carry out the ulterior purpose for which it puts to\r\nsea. That armed force may be purely naval, or it may consist wholly or in\r\npart of a military expedition. If it be purely naval, then our blockade is\r\na method of securing command. If it be purely military, it is a method of\r\nexercising command, and as such will be dealt with when we come to consider\r\ndefence against invasion. But in so far as military expeditions are\r\nnormally accompanied by a naval escort, operations to prevent their sailing\r\nare not purely concerned with the exercise of command. Naval blockade,\r\ntherefore, may be regarded for practical purposes as a method of securing\r\ncommand and as a function of battle-squadrons. Commercial blockade, on the\r\nother hand, is essentially a method of exercising command, and is mainly an\r\naffair of cruisers. Its immediate object is to stop the flow of the enemy's\r\nsea-borne trade, whether carried in his own or neutral bottoms, by denying\r\nhim the use of trade communications.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the conduct of war, therefore, we have two\r\nwell-defined categories of blockade, naval and commercial. But our\r\nclassification must go further; for naval blockade itself is equally varied\r\nin intention, and must be subdivided. Strictly speaking, the term implies a\r\ndesire to close the blockaded port and to prevent the enemy putting to sea.\r\nBut this was not always the intention. As often as not our wish was that he\r\nshould put to sea that we might bring him to action, and in order to do\r\nthis, before he could effect his purpose, we had to watch the port with a\r\nfleet more or less closely. For this operation there was no special name.\r\nWidely as it differed in object from the other, it was also usually called\r\nblockade, and Nelson's protest against the consequent confusion of thought\r\nis well known. \"It is not my intention,\" he said, \"to close-watch Toulon\";\r\nand again, \"My system is the very contrary of blockading. Every opportunity\r\nhas been offered the enemy to put to sea.\" It is desirable, therefore, to\r\nadopt terms to distinguish the two forms. \"Close\" and \"open\" express the\r\nantithesis suggested by Nelson's letter, and the two terms serve well\r\nenough to mark the characteristic feature of each operation. Close\r\nblockade, it is true, as formerly conceived, is generally regarded as no\r\nlonger practicable; but the antithetical ideas, which the two forms of\r\nblockade connote, can never be eliminated from strategical consideration.\r\nIt must always be with the relations of these two forms, whatever shape\r\nthey may take in future, that the strategy of naval blockade is chiefly\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nWith regard to commercial blockade, in strict analysis it should be\r\neliminated from an inquiry that concerns methods of securing command and\r\npostponed to that section of exercising command which deals with the attack\r\nand defence of trade. It is, however, necessary to treat certain of its\r\naspects in conjunction with naval blockade for two reasons: one, that as a\r\nrule naval blockade is indissolubly united to a subordinate commercial\r\nblockade; and the other, that the commercial form, though its immediate\r\nobject is the exercise of control, has almost invariably an ulterior object\r\nwhich is concerned with securing control; that is to say, while its\r\nimmediate object was to keep the enemy's commercial ports closed, its\r\nulterior object was to force his fleet to sea.\r\n\r\nCommercial blockade, therefore, has an intimate relation with naval\r\nblockade in its open form. We adopt that form when we wish his fleet to put\r\nto sea, and commercial blockade is usually the most effective means we have\r\nof forcing upon him the movement we leave him free to attempt. By closing\r\nhis commercial ports we exercise the highest power of injuring him which\r\nthe command of the sea can give us. We choke the flow of his national\r\nactivity afloat in the same way that military occupation of his territory\r\nchokes it ashore. He must, therefore, either tamely submit to the worst\r\nwhich a naval defeat can inflict upon him, or he must fight to release\r\nhimself. He may see fit to choose the one course or the other, but in any\r\ncase we can do no more by naval means alone to force our will upon him.\r\n\r\nIn the long run a rigorous and uninterrupted blockade is almost sure to\r\nexhaust him before it exhausts us, but the end will be far and costly. As a\r\nrule, therefore, we have found that where we had a substantial predominance\r\nour enemy preferred to submit to commercial blockade in hope that by the\r\nchances of war or the development of fresh force he might later on be in a\r\nbetter position to come out into the open. That he should come out and\r\nstake the issue in battle was nearly always our wish, and it was obvious\r\nthat too rigorous a naval blockade was not the way to achieve the desired\r\nend, or to reap the strategical result which we might expect from\r\nparalysing his commerce. Consequently where the desire for a decision at\r\nsea was not crossed by higher military considerations, as in the case of\r\nimminent invasion, or where we ourselves had an important expedition in\r\nhand, it was to our interest to incline the enemy's mind towards the bolder\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThe means was to tempt him with a prospect of success, either by leading\r\nhim to believe the blockading force was smaller than it was, or by removing\r\nit to such a distance as would induce him to attempt to evade it, or both.\r\nA leading case of such an open blockade was Nelson's disposition of his\r\nfleet off Cadiz when he was seeking to bring Villeneuve to action in 1805.\r\nBut merely to leave a port open does not fulfil the idea of open blockade,\r\nand in this case to opportunity and temptation Nelson added the pressure of\r\na commercial blockade of the adjacent ports in hope of starving Villeneuve\r\ninto the necessity of taking to the sea.\r\n\r\nFinally, in a general comparison of the two forms, we have to observe that\r\nclose blockade is characteristically a method of securing local and\r\ntemporary command. Its dominating purpose will usually be to prevent the\r\nenemy's fleet acting in a certain area and for a certain purpose. Whereas\r\nopen blockade, in that it aims at the destruction of an enemy's naval\r\nforce, is a definite step towards securing permanent command.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to show that the question of choice between close\r\nand open blockade is one of extreme complexity. Our naval literature, it is\r\ntrue, presents the old masters as divided into two schools on the subject,\r\nimplying that one was in favour of the close form always, and the other of\r\nthe open form. We are even led to believe that the choice depended on the\r\nmilitary spirit of the officer concerned. If his military spirit was high,\r\nhe chose the close and more exacting form; if it were low, he was content\r\nwith the open and less exacting form. True, we are told that men of the\r\nlatter school based their objections to close blockade on the excessive\r\nwear and tear of a fleet that it involved, but it is too often suggested\r\nthat this attitude was no more than a mask for a defective spirit. Seldom\r\nif ever are we invited to compare their decisions with the attendant\r\nstrategical intention, with the risks which the conditions justified, or\r\nwith the expenditure of energy which the desired result could legitimately\r\ndemand. Yet all these considerations must enter into the choice, and on\r\ncloser examination of the leading cases it will be found that they bear a\r\nstriking and almost constant relation to the nature of the blockade\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIn considering open blockade, three postulates must be kept in mind.\r\nFirstly, since our object is to get the enemy to sea, our position must be\r\nsuch as will give him an opportunity of doing so. Secondly, since we desire\r\ncontact for a decisive battle, that position must be no further away from\r\nhis port than is compatible with bringing him to action before he can\r\neffect his purpose. Thirdly, there is the idea of economy--that is, the\r\nidea of adopting the method which is least exhausting to our fleet, and\r\nwhich will best preserve its battle fitness. It is on the last point that\r\nthe greatest difference of opinion has existed. A close blockade always\r\ntended to exhaust a fleet, and always must do so. But, on the other hand,\r\nit was contended that the exhaustion is compensated by the high temper and\r\nmoral domination which the maintenance of a close blockade produces in a\r\ngood fleet, whereas the comparative ease of distant and secure watch tended\r\nto deterioration. Before considering these opposed views, one warning is\r\nnecessary. It is usually assumed that the alternative to close blockade is\r\nwatching the enemy from one of our own ports, but this is not essential.\r\nWhat is required is an interior and, if possible, a secret position which\r\nwill render contact certain; and with modern developments in the means of\r\ndistant communication, such a position is usually better found at sea than\r\nin port. A watching position can in fact be obtained free from the strain\r\nof dangerous navigation and incessant liability to attack without sacrifice\r\nof sea training. With this very practical point in mind, we may proceed to\r\ntest the merits of the two forms on abstract principles.\r\n\r\nIt was always obvious that a close naval blockade was one of the weakest\r\nand least desirable forms of war. Here again when we say \"weakest\" we do\r\nnot mean \"least effective,\" but that it was exhausting, and that it tended\r\nto occupy a force greater than that against which it was acting. This was\r\nnot because a blockading fleet, tempered and toughened by its watch, and\r\nwith great advantage of tactical position, could not be counted on to\r\nengage successfully a raw fleet of equal force issuing from port, but\r\nbecause in order to maintain its active efficiency it required large\r\nreserves for its relief. So severe was the wear and tear both to men and\r\nships, that even the most strenuous exponents of the system considered that\r\nat least a fifth of the force should always be refitting, and in every case\r\ntwo admirals were employed to relieve one another. In 1794 one of the\r\nhighest authorities in the service considered that to maintain an effective\r\nclose blockade of Brest two complete sets of flag-officers were necessary,\r\nand that no less than one-fourth of the squadron should always be in\r\nport.[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] Captain Philip Patton to Sir Charles Middleton, 27 June 1794.\r\n  _Barham Papers_, ii, 393. Patton had probably wider war experience than\r\n  any officer then living. He was regarded as possessing a very special\r\n  knowledge of personnel, and as vice admiral became second sea lord under\r\n  Barham in 1804.\r\n\r\nNow these weaknesses, being inherent in close blockade, necessarily\r\naffected the appreciation of its value. The weight of the objection tended\r\nof course to decrease as seamanship, material, or organisation improved,\r\nbut it was always a factor. It is true also that it seems to have had more\r\nweight with some men than with others, but it will appear equally true, if\r\nwe endeavour to trace the movement of opinion on the subject, that it was\r\nfar from being the sole determinant.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Seven Years' War under Anson's administration that continuous\r\nand close blockade was first used systematically, but it was Hawke who\r\noriginated it. In the first three campaigns the old system of watching\r\nBrest from a British western port had been in vogue, but it had twice\r\nfailed to prevent a French concentration in the vital Canadian theatre. In\r\nthe spring of 1759 Hawke was in command of the Channel Fleet with the usual\r\ninstructions for watching, but being directed to stand over and look into\r\nBrest, he intimated his intention, unless he received orders to the\r\ncontrary, to remain off the port instead of returning to Torbay. His reason\r\nwas that he had found there a squadron which he believed was intended for\r\nthe West Indies, and he considered it better to prevent its sailing than to\r\nlet it put to sea and try to catch it. In other words, he argued that none\r\nof the usual western watching ports afforded a position interior to the\r\nusual French route from Brest to the West Indies.\r\n\r\nSince rumours of invasion were in the air, it was obviously the better\r\ncourse to deal with the enemy's squadrons in home waters and avoid\r\ndispersal of the fleet in seeking them out. In spite of extraordinarily bad\r\nweather, therefore, he was permitted to act as he advised. With Boscawen as\r\nrelief, the new form of blockade was kept up thenceforward, and with entire\r\nsuccess. But it must be noted that this success was rather due to the fact\r\nthat the French made no further effort to cross the Atlantic, than to the\r\nfact that the blockade was maintained with sufficient strictness to prevent\r\ntheir doing so. In certain states of weather our fleet was forced to raise\r\nthe blockade and run to Torbay or Plymouth. Such temporary reversions to\r\nthe open form nearly always afforded an opportunity for the French to get\r\naway to the southward with two or three days' start. Against any attempt,\r\nhowever, to get to the east or the north in order to dispute command of the\r\nChannel or other home waters the system was thoroughly efficient, and was\r\nunaffected by the intervals of the open form.\r\n\r\nIt may have been these considerations which in the War of American\r\nIndependence induced so fine an officer as Howe to be strongly in favour of\r\na reversion to the old system. The vital theatre was then again across the\r\nAtlantic, and there was no serious preparation for invasion. It should also\r\nbe borne in mind in judging Howe against Hawke, that in the Seven Years'\r\nWar we had such a preponderance at sea as permitted ample reserves to\r\nnourish a close blockade, whereas in the latter war we were numerically\r\ninferior to the hostile coalition. Since it was impossible to prevent the\r\nFrench reaching the West Indies and North America if they so determined,\r\nour policy was to follow them with equal fleets and reduce the home force\r\nas low as that policy demanded and as was consistent with a reasonable\r\ndegree of safety. The force required might well be inferior to the enemy,\r\nsince it was certain that all attempts upon the Channel would be made with\r\nan unwieldy and ill-knit force composed of Spanish and French units.\r\n\r\nIn Howe's opinion this particular situation was not to be solved by\r\nattempting to close Brest, and nothing can be more misleading than to\r\nstretch such an opinion beyond the circumstances it was intended to meet.\r\nHe did not consider it was in his power to close the port. The enemy, he\r\nheld, could always be in readiness to escape after a gale of wind by which\r\nthe blockading squadron would be drawn off or dispersed, the ships much\r\ndamaged, and the enemy enheartened. \"An enemy,\" he said, \"is not to be\r\nrestrained from putting to sea by a station taken off their port with a\r\nbarely superior squadron.\" The experience of 1805 appears to contradict\r\nhim. Then a barely superior squadron did succeed in preventing Ganteaume's\r\nexit, but though the squadron actually employed was barely superior, it had\r\nample fleet reserves to sustain its numbers in efficiency. It was,\r\nmoreover, only for a short time that it had to deal with any real effort to\r\nescape. After May 20th, Ganteaume was forbidden to put to sea. There were\r\ncertainly several occasions during that famous blockade when he could have\r\nescaped to the southward had Napoleon wished it.\r\n\r\nThis case, then, cannot be taken to condemn Howe's judgment. His special\r\nfunction in the war plan was, with a force reduced to defensive strength,\r\nto prevent the enemy obtaining command of our home waters. It was certainly\r\nnot his duty to undertake operations to which his force was not equal. His\r\nfirst duty was to keep it in being for its paramount purpose. To this end\r\nhe decided on open blockade based on a general reserve at Spithead or St.\r\nHelen's, where he could husband the ships and train his recruits, while at\r\nthe same time he protected our trade and communications and harassed those\r\nof the enemy. Kempenfelt, than whom there was no warmer advocate of\r\nactivity, entirely approved the policy at least for the winter months, and\r\nin his case no one will be found to suggest that the idea was prompted by\r\nlack of spirit or love of ease. So far as the summer was concerned there\r\nwas really little difference of opinion as to whether the fleet should be\r\nkept at sea or not, for sea-training during summer more than compensated\r\nfor the exhaustion of material likely to be caused by intermittent spells\r\nof bad weather. Even for the winter the two policies came to much the same\r\nthing. Thus in Hawke's blockade at the end of 1759, during the critical\r\nmonth from mid-October to mid-November, he was unable to keep his station\r\nfor nearly half the time, and when he did get contact with Conflans it was\r\nfrom Torbay and not Ushant. Still it may be doubted if without the\r\nconfidence bred of his stormy vigil the battle of Quiberon would have been\r\nfought as it was.\r\n\r\nWith all this experience fresh in his mind Kempenfelt frankly advocated\r\nkeeping the fleet in port for the winter. \"Suppose,\" he wrote from Torbay\r\nin November 1779, \"the enemy should put to sea with their fleet (that is,\r\nfrom Brest)--a thing much to be wished for by us--let us act wisely and\r\nkeep ours in port. Leave them to the mercy of long nights and hard gales.\r\nThey will do more in favour of you than your fleet can.\" Far better he\r\nthought to devote the winter to preparing the fleet for the next campaign\r\nso as to have \"the advantage of being the first in the field.\" \"Let us,\" he\r\nconcluded, \"keep a stout squadron to the westward ready to attend the\r\nmotions of the enemy. I don't mean to keep them at sea, disabling\r\nthemselves in buffeting the winds, but at Torbay ready to act as\r\nintelligence may suggest.\"[17] It will be seen, therefore, that the\r\nconclusion that close blockade was always the best means of rendering the\r\nfleet most efficient for the function it had to perform must not be\r\naccepted too hastily. The reasons which induced Howe and Kempenfelt to\r\nprefer open blockade were mainly based on this very consideration. Having\r\nin mind the whole of the surrounding conditions, in their highly\r\nexperienced opinion careful preparation in the winter and tactical\r\nevolutions in the summer were the surest road to battle fitness in the\r\nforce available.\r\n\r\n  [17] _Barham Papers_, i, 302.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have the fact that during the War of American\r\nIndependence the open system was not very successful. But before condemning\r\nit out of hand, it must be remembered that the causes of failure were not\r\nall inherent in the system. In the first place, the need of relieving\r\nGibraltar from time to time prevented the Western Squadron devoting itself\r\nentirely to its watch. In the next place, owing to defective administration\r\nthe winters were not devoted with sufficient energy to preparing the fleet\r\nto be first in the field in the spring. Finally, we have to recognise that\r\nthe lack of success was due not so much to permitting the French to cross\r\nthe Atlantic, as to the failure to deal faithfully with them when contact\r\nwas obtained at their destination. Obviously there is nothing to be said\r\nfor the policy of \"seeking out\" as against that of preventing exit unless\r\nyou are determined when you find to destroy or to be destroyed. It was here\r\nthat Rodney and his fellows were found wanting. The system failed from\r\ndefective execution quite as much as from defective design.\r\n\r\nIn the next war Howe was still in the ascendant and in command of the\r\nChannel fleet. He retained his system. Leaving Brest open he forced the\r\nFrench by operating against their trade to put to sea, and he was rewarded\r\nwith the battle of the First of June. No attempt was made to maintain a\r\nclose blockade during the following winter. The French were allowed to\r\nsail, and their disastrous cruise of January 1795 fully justified\r\nKempenfelt's anticipations. So great was the damage done that they\r\nabandoned all idea of using their fleet as a whole. Howe's system was\r\ncontinued, but no longer with entirely successful results. In 1796 the\r\nFrench were able to make descents upon Ireland, and Howe in consequence has\r\ncome in for the severest castigations. His method is contemptuously\r\ncontrasted with that which St. Vincent adopted four years later, without\r\nany regard to the situation each admiral had to meet, and again on the\r\nassumption that the closing of Brest would have solved the one problem as\r\nwell as it did the other.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 we were not on the defensive as we were in 1800. The French fleet\r\nhad been practically destroyed. No invasion threatened. With a view to\r\nforcing peace our policy was directed to offensive action against French\r\ntrade and territory in order by general pressure to back our overtures for\r\na settlement. The policy may have been mistaken, but that is not the\r\nquestion. The question is, whether or not the strategy fitted the policy.\r\nWe were also, it must be remembered, at war with Holland and expecting war\r\nwith Spain, an eventuality which forced us to keep an eye on the defence of\r\nPortugal. In these circumstances nothing was further from our desire than\r\nto keep what was left of the Brest fleet in port. Our hope was by our\r\noffensive action against French maritime interests to force it to expose\r\nitself for their defence. To devote the fleet to the closing of Brest was\r\nto cripple it for offensive action and to play the enemy's game. The actual\r\ndisposition of the home fleet was designed so as to preserve its offensive\r\nactivity, and at the same time to ensure superiority in any part of the\r\nhome waters in which the enemy might attempt a counterstroke. It was\r\ndistributed in three active squadrons, one in the North Sea, one before\r\nBrest, and one cruising to the westward, with a strong reserve at\r\nPortsmouth. It is the location of the reserve that has been most lightly\r\nridiculed, on the hasty assumption that it was merely the reserve of the\r\nsquadron before Brest; whereas in truth it was a general reserve designed\r\nto act in the North Sea or wherever else it might be needed. At the same\r\ntime it served as a training and depot squadron for increasing our power at\r\nsea in view of the probable addition of the Spanish fleet to Napoleon's\r\nnaval force. To have exhausted our fleet merely to prevent raids leaving\r\nBrest which might equally well leave the Texel or Dunkirk was just what the\r\nenemy would have desired. The disposition was in fact a good example of\r\nconcentration--that is, disposal about a strategical centre to preserve\r\nflexibility for offence without risking defensive needs, and yet it is by\r\nthe most ardent advocates of concentration and the offensive that Howe's\r\ndispositions at this time have been most roundly condemned.\r\n\r\nIn the end the disposition did fail to prevent the landing of part of the\r\nforce intended for Ireland, but it made the venture so difficult that it\r\nhad to be deferred till mid-winter, and then the weather which rendered\r\nevasion possible broke up the expedition and denied it all chance of\r\nserious success. It was, in fact, another example of the working of\r\nKempenfelt's rule concerning winter weather. So far as naval defence can\r\ngo, the disposition was all that was required. The Irish expedition was\r\nseen leaving Brest by our inshore cruiser squadron. It was reported to\r\nColpoys, who had the battle-squadron outside, and it was only a dense fog\r\nthat enabled it to escape. It was, in fact, nothing more than the evasion\r\nof a small raiding force--an eventuality against which no naval defence can\r\nprovide certain guarantee, especially in winter.\r\n\r\nIt was under wholly different conditions that at the end of 1800 Hawke's\r\nsystem was revived. St. Vincent's succession to the control of the fleet\r\ncoincided with Napoleon's definite assumption of the control of the\r\ndestinies of France. Our great duel with him had begun. The measures he was\r\ntaking made it obvious we were once more facing the old life and death\r\nstruggle for naval supremacy; we were openly threatened with invasion, and\r\nwe had a distinct preponderance at sea. In short, we have to recognize the\r\nfact that the methods of the Seven Years' War were revived when the\r\nproblems and factors of that war were renewed. As those problems grew more\r\nintense, as they did after the Peace of Amiens, and the threat of invasion\r\nbecame really formidable, so did the rigour of the close blockade increase.\r\nUnder Cornwallis and Gardner it was maintained in such a way as to deny, so\r\nfar as human effort could go, all possibility of exit without fighting. In\r\nspite of the importance of dealing with the enemy's squadrons in detail no\r\nrisks were taken to bring Ganteaume to decisive action. Our first necessity\r\nwas absolute local command. The acuteness of the invasion crisis demanded\r\nthat the Brest fleet should be kept in port, and every time Ganteaume\r\nshowed a foot the British admiral flew at him and drove him back. Once only\r\nduring the continuation of the crisis was the rigour of this attitude\r\nrelaxed, and that was to deal with what for the moment was the higher\r\nobject. It was to meet Villeneuve on his return from the West Indies, but\r\neven then so nicely was the relaxation calculated, that Ganteaume was given\r\nno time to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nThe analogy between the conditions of the blockade which St. Vincent\r\ninaugurated and those of the Seven Years' War becomes all the more\r\nsignificant when we note that while Cornwallis and Gardner in home waters\r\nwere pressing close blockade to its utmost limit of rigour, Nelson in the\r\nMediterranean was not using it at all. Yet with him also the chief concern\r\nwas to prevent an invasion. His main function, as he and his Government saw\r\nit, was to prevent a descent from Southern France upon Neapolitan or\r\nLevantine territory. Why, then, did he not employ close blockade? It is\r\nusually assumed that it was because of his overpowering desire to bring the\r\nToulon squadron to action. Occasional expressions in his letters give\r\ncolour to such a view, but his dispositions show clearly that his desire to\r\nbring the fleet to action was kept in scientific subordination to the\r\ndefensive duty with which he was charged. Close blockade was the most\r\neffectual means of securing this end, but in his case one of the\r\nconditions, which we have found always accompanying successful close\r\nblockade, was absent. He had no such preponderance of force as would enable\r\nhim to nourish it up to the point of perfect continuity. In the\r\ncircumstances the close form was too weak or exhausting for him to use with\r\nthe force at his disposal.\r\n\r\nIf this case be not considered conclusive as to Nelson's views, we have a\r\nperfectly clear endorsement from his pen in 1801. It is a particularly\r\nstrong testimony, for he was at the time actually charged with defence\r\nagainst the invasion of England. With several cruiser squadrons he had to\r\nprevent the enemy's force issuing from a number of ports extending from\r\nFlushing to Dieppe, and he was directing the operations from the Downs. On\r\nthe approach of winter he was impressed with the inexpediency of attempting\r\nto continue a close blockade, and wrote to the Admiralty as follows: \"I am\r\nof opinion, and submit to their Lordships' better judgment, that care\r\nshould be taken to keep our squadrons compact and in good order ... under\r\nDungeness to be their principal station.... In fine weather our squadrons\r\nto go out and show themselves, but never to risk either being crippled or\r\ndrawn into the North Sea; thus we shall always be sure of an effective\r\nforce, ready to act as occasion calls for it.\"[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] To Evan Nepean, 4 September 1801. Nicolas, _Nelson Despatches_, iv,\r\n  484.\r\n\r\nThe case of course is not entirely in point, for it concerns the question\r\nof direct resistance to invasion and not to securing general command. Its\r\nvalue is that it gives Nelson's views on the broad question of balancing\r\nthe risks--that is, the risk of relaxing close watch against the risk of\r\ndestroying the efficiency of the ships by maintaining it too rigorously.\r\n\r\nWith Nelson holding this view, it is not surprising to find that as late as\r\n1804 naval opinion was not quite settled on the relative advantages of\r\nclose and open blockade even in the case of threatened invasion. Just a\r\nyear before Trafalgar was fought, Cornwallis pressed the Admiralty for more\r\nstrength to enable him to keep his blockade efficient. Lord Melville, who\r\nat this time had Barham at his elbow, replied recommending the \"policy of\r\nrelaxing the strictness of blockade, formerly resorted to.\" He protested\r\nthe means available were insufficient for \"sustaining the necessary extent\r\nof naval force, if your ships are to be torn to pieces by an eternal\r\nconflict with the elements during the tempestuous months of winter.\"[19]\r\nMelville was craving for a decisive action to end the insupportable strain.\r\n\"Allow me to remind you,\" he added, \"that the occasions when we have been\r\nable to bring our enemy to battle and our fleets to victory have generally\r\nbeen when we were at a distance from the blockading station.\" In the end,\r\nas we know, Cornwallis had his way, and the verdict of history has been to\r\napprove the decision for its moral effect alone. Such conflicts must always\r\narise. \"War,\" as Wolfe said, \"is an option of difficulties,\" and the choice\r\nmust sway to the one side or the other as the circumstances tend to develop\r\nthe respective advantages of each form. We can never say that close\r\nblockade is better than open, or the reverse. It must always be a matter of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n  [19] For Barham's final views, 1805, see _Barham Papers_, iii, 90-93.\r\n\r\nAre there, then, no principles which we can deduce from the old practice\r\nfor the strengthening of judgment? Certain broad lines of guidance at least\r\nare to be traced. The main question will be, is it to our advantage, in\r\nregard to all the strategical conditions, to keep the enemy in and get him\r\nto sea for a decision? Presumably it will always be our policy to get a\r\ndecision as soon as possible. Still that desire may be overridden by the\r\nnecessity or special advantage of closely blockading one or more of his\r\nsquadrons. This situation may arise in two ways. Firstly, it may be\r\nessential to provide for the local and temporary command of a certain\r\ntheatre of operations, as when an invasion threatens in that area, or when\r\nwe wish to pass a military expedition across it, or from special exigencies\r\nin regard to the attack or defence of commerce. Secondly, even where we are\r\nseeking a great decision, we may blockade one squadron closely in order to\r\ninduce a decision at the point most advantageous to ourselves; that is to\r\nsay, we may blockade one or more squadrons in order to induce the enemy to\r\nattempt with one or more other squadrons to break that blockade. In this\r\nway we may lead him either to expose himself to be struck in detail, or to\r\nconcentrate where we desire his concentration.\r\n\r\nFor any of these reasons we may decide that the best way of realising our\r\nobject is to use close blockade, but the matter does not end there. We have\r\nstill to consider whether close blockade is within the limit of the force\r\nwe have available, and whether it is the best method of developing the\r\nfullest potentialities of that force. Close blockade being the more\r\nexhausting form will require the greater strength; we cannot blockade\r\nclosely for any length of time without a force relatively superior; but if\r\nby open blockade of a squadron we permit it to put to sea with contact\r\nassured, we know that, even with a slightly inferior force, we can so deal\r\nwith it as to prevent its getting local control sufficient to break down\r\nour mobile flotilla defence or to interfere seriously with our trade.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is the question of risk. In the old days, before free\r\nmovement and wireless telegraphy, and before the flotilla had acquired\r\nbattle power, there was always to be faced the risk of not getting contact\r\nin time to prevent mischief. This consideration was specially dominant\r\nwhere the enemy had a squadron within or near the critical theatre of\r\noperations. Therefore when the invasion threatened, our developed policy\r\nwas to blockade Brest closely at almost any sacrifice. There was always a\r\nvague possibility that by evasion or chance of wind a squadron so close to\r\nthe line of invasion might get sufficient temporary command in the vital\r\narea before it could be brought to action. It was a possibility that was\r\nnever realised in the Narrow Seas, and since mobility of fleets and means\r\nof distant communication have so greatly increased in range and certainty,\r\nand since the power of resistance in the flotilla has become so high, the\r\nrisk is probably much less than ever, and the field for open blockade is\r\nconsequently less restricted.\r\n\r\nThere is no need, however, to accept these principles as incontrovertible.\r\nEven if we take the great blockade of 1803-5, which has most firmly\r\ndominated thought on the subject ever since, it may be argued with some\r\nplausibility that the situation could have been solved more quickly and\r\neffectually by letting Ganteaume get out from Brest into the open, at least\r\nas far as Admiral Togo was forced to permit the Russians to emerge from\r\nPort Arthur, though his reasons for keeping them in were even stronger than\r\nours in 1805. But in any case, the whole trend of the evidence will admit\r\nno doubt as to the inherent weakness of close blockade as a form of war. As\r\nunder modern developments the possibilities of open blockade have\r\nincreased, so the difficulties and dangers of close blockade have certainly\r\nnot decreased. It is also probable that certain advantages which in the\r\nsailing era went far to compensate for its weakness have lost much of their\r\nforce. A sailing fleet cooped up in port not only rapidly lost its spirit,\r\nbut, being barred from sea-training, could not be kept in a condition of\r\nefficiency, whereas the blockading fleet was quickly raised to the highest\r\ntemper by the stress of vigilance and danger that was its incessant\r\nportion. So long as the strain did not pass the limit of human endurance,\r\nit was all to the good. In the old days, with very moderate reliefs, the\r\nlimit was never reached, and the sacrifices that were made to those\r\nexhausting vigils were rewarded twentyfold in exuberant confidence on the\r\nday of battle. Can we expect the same compensation now? Will the balance of\r\nstrength and weakness remain as it used to be? In the face of the vast\r\nchange of conditions and the thinness of experience, it is to general\r\nprinciples we must turn for the answer.\r\n\r\nWhat, in fact, is the inherent weakness of close blockade? Strategical\r\ntheory will at once reply that it is an operation which involves \"an arrest\r\nof the offensive,\" a situation which is usually taken to exhibit every kind\r\nof drawback. Close blockade is essentially an offensive operation, although\r\nits object is usually negative; that is, it is a forward movement to\r\nprevent the enemy carrying out some offensive operation either direct or by\r\nway of counterstroke. So far the common tendency to confuse \"Seeking out\r\nthe enemy's fleet\" with \"Making the enemy's coast your frontier\" may be\r\ncondoned. But the two operations are widely different in that they have\r\ndifferent objectives. In \"seeking out,\" our objective is the enemy's armed\r\nforce. In \"making the enemy's coast our frontier,\" the objective is\r\ninseparable from the ulterior object of the naval war. In this case the\r\nobjective is the common communications. By establishing a blockade we\r\noperate offensively against those communications. We occupy them, and then\r\nwe can do no more. Our offensive is arrested; we cannot carry it on to the\r\ndestruction of the enemy's fleet. We have to wait in a defensive attitude,\r\nholding the communications we have seized, till he chooses to attack in\r\norder to break our hold; and during that period of arrest the advantage of\r\nsurprise--the all-important advantage in war--passes by a well recognised\r\nrule to our enemy. We, in fact, are held upon the defensive, with none of\r\nthe material advantages of the defensive. The moral advantage of having\r\ntaken the initiative remains, but that is all. The advantage which we thus\r\ngain will of course have the same kind of depressing effect upon the\r\nblockaded fleet as it had of old, but scarcely in so high a degree. The\r\ndegradation of a steam fleet in port can scarcely be so rapid or\r\ndebilitating as it was when nine-tenths of seamanship lay in the smart\r\nhandling of sails. For the blockading fleet it is also true that the\r\neffects of weather, which formerly were the main cause of wear and tear,\r\ncan scarcely be so severe. But, on the other hand, the physical strain to\r\nofficers and men, and the difficulty of supply, will be far greater, so\r\nlong at least as coal is the chief fuel. The wind no longer sets a measure\r\non the enemy's movements. Vigilance close and unremitting beyond all our\r\npredecessors knew is the portion of the blockaders to prevent surprise.\r\nFurthermore, in the old days surprise meant at worst the enemy's escape;\r\nnow it may mean our own destruction by mine or torpedo. It is unnecessary\r\nto labour the point. It is too obvious that a close blockade of the old\r\ntype exhibits under present conditions the defects of \"arrested offence\" in\r\nso high a degree as practically to prohibit its use.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, can be done? Must we rest content in all situations with Howe's\r\nsystem, which riper experience condemned for cases of extreme necessity?\r\nCannot the old close blockade be given a modern form? Assuredly it can. In\r\nold days the shoreward limit of the blockading fleet was just beyond the\r\nrange of the coast batteries, and this position it held continuously by\r\nmeans of an inshore squadron. In these days of mobile defence that limit is\r\nby analogy the night range of destroyers and the day range of submarines,\r\nthat is, half the distance they can traverse between dark and dawn or dawn\r\nand dark respectively, unless within that limit a torpedo-proof base can be\r\nestablished. A blockade of this nature will correspond in principle to a\r\nclose blockade of the old type; nor in practice, as was proved in the\r\nJapanese blockade of Port Arthur, will its incidents be materially\r\ndifferent. The distance at which the battle-squadron must keep will seem at\r\nfirst sight to deny it certainty of immediate contact--the essence of close\r\nblockade. But in truth other new factors already noticed will reduce that\r\ndistance relatively. Quicker and more certain means of communication\r\nbetween the admiral and his scouts, the absolute freedom of movement and\r\nthe power of delaying the enemy's actual exit by mining, may go far to\r\nbring things back to their old relations. At Port Arthur they did so\r\nentirely. If then, as in that case, our paramount object is to keep the\r\nenemy in, there seems still no reason why we should not make our\r\ndispositions on the principle of close blockade. Distances will be greater,\r\nbut that is all.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten that for a squadron to take station off a port in\r\nthe old manner is not the only means of close blockade. It may still effect\r\nits purpose, at least temporarily, by supporting mining vessels or block\r\nships--\"sinkers,\" as they used to be called. The latter expedient, it is\r\ntrue, had little success in the latest experiments, but even in the\r\nRusso-Japanese War its possibilities were by no means exhausted. We have\r\ntherefore to conclude that where the strategical conditions call obviously\r\nfor close blockade, our plan of operations will be modified in that\r\ndirection with the means still at our disposal.\r\n\r\nIf, however, our object is not so sharply defined, if in spite of our\r\ndesire to deny the enemy the sea we are ready to take risks in order to\r\nbring about a decision, the case is not so clear. It will be observed that\r\nthe looseness which the new conditions force upon close blockade-increasing\r\nas they are in intensity year by year-must tend more and more to\r\napproximate it in practice to open blockade. The question will therefore\r\npresent itself whether it would not be more in accordance with the\r\nfundamental elements of strength to adopt open blockade frankly for all\r\npurposes. We should thus substitute a true defensive disposition for an\r\narrested offence, and, theoretically, that in itself is a great advantage.\r\nThe practical benefits, whatever the correlative drawbacks, are equally\r\nclear, nor are they less great now than they appeared to Howe and\r\nKempenfelt. We avoid exhaustion of machinery, coal, and men, and this, at\r\nleast for the necessary flotilla screen, will be greater than anything that\r\nhad to be faced in former days. We have at least the opportunity of\r\noccupying a position secure from surprise, and of keeping the fleet\r\ncontinually up to its highest striking energy. Finally, assuming the\r\ngeographical conditions give reasonable promise of contact, a quick\r\ndecision, which modern war demands with ever greater insistence, is more\r\nprobable. In such a disposition of course contact can rarely be made\r\ncertain. The enemy, whom the hypothesis of blockade assumes to be anxious\r\nto avoid action, will always have a chance of evasion, but this will always\r\nbe so, even with the closest blockade now possible. We may even go further\r\nand claim for open blockade that in favourable conditions it may give the\r\nbetter chance of contact. For by adopting the principle of open blockade we\r\nshall have, in accordance with the theory of defence, the further\r\nadvantages of being able the better to conceal our dispositions, and\r\nconsequently to lay traps for our enemy, such as that which Nelson prepared\r\nfor Villeneuve in the Gulf of Lyons in 1805.\r\n\r\nThe objection to such a course which appears to have the most weight with\r\ncurrent opinion is the moral one, which is inseparable from all deliberate\r\nchoices of the defensive. If the watching fleet remains in a home fortified\r\nbase, it may be assumed that the usual moral degradation will set in. But\r\nthe method does not entail the inglorious security of such a base. A sound\r\nposition may well be found at a spot such as Admiral Togo occupied while\r\nwaiting for the Baltic fleet, and in that case there was no observable\r\ndegradation of any kind. Nor is there much evidence that this objection\r\nweighed materially with the opponents of Howe's view. Their objection was\r\nof a purely physical kind. Open blockade left the enemy too much freedom to\r\nraid our trade routes. The watching system might be sufficient to keep an\r\nunwilling battle-fleet in port or to bring a more adventurous one to\r\naction, but it could not control raiding squadrons. This was certainly\r\nBarham's objection. \"If,\" he wrote to Pitt in 1794, \"the French should have\r\nany intention of sending their fleet to sea with this easterly wind, and\r\nLord Howe continues at Torbay, our Mediterranean and Jamaica convoys are in\r\na very critical situation. Both fleets must by this time be drawing near\r\nthe Channel, and cannot enter it while the easterly wind holds.\" This\r\ndanger must always be with us, especially in narrow waters such as the\r\nNorth Sea. In more open theatres the difficulty is not so obtrusive, for\r\nwith sufficient sea room trade may take naturally or by direction a course\r\nwhich our watching dispositions will cover. Thus with Nelson in the case of\r\nToulon, his normal positions on the Sardinian coast covered effectually the\r\nflow of our trade to the Levant and the Two Sicilies, which was all there\r\nwas at the time.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that in endeavouring to decide between open and close\r\nblockade we find ourselves confronted with those special difficulties which\r\nso sharply distinguish naval warfare from warfare on land. We cannot choose\r\non purely naval considerations. In naval warfare, however great may be our\r\ndesire to concentrate our effort on the enemy's main forces, the ulterior\r\nobject will always obtrude itself. We must from the first do our best to\r\ncontrol sea communications, and since those communications are usually\r\ncommon, we cannot refrain from occupying those of the enemy without at the\r\nsame time neglecting and exposing our own. Thus in the case of Brest a\r\nclose blockade was always desirable, and especially at convoy seasons,\r\nbecause the great trade routes which passed within striking distance of the\r\nport were all common, whereas in the region of Toulon the main lines were\r\nnot common except along the coasts of Africa and Southern Italy, and these\r\nNelson's open blockade amply secured.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion, then, is that however high may be the purely naval\r\nand strategical reasons for adopting open blockade as the best means of\r\nsecuring a decision against the enemy's fleet, yet the inevitable intrusion\r\nof the ulterior object in the form of trade protection or the security of\r\nmilitary expeditions will seldom leave us entirely free to use the open\r\nmethod. We must be prepared, in fact, to find ourselves at least at times\r\nfaced with the necessity of using a form of blockade as nearly modelled on\r\nthe old close blockade as changed conditions will permit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                 CHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n          METHODS OF DISPUTING COMMAND\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI. DEFENSIVE FLEET OPERATIONS--\"A FLEET IN BEING\"\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the theory of sea command, attention was called to the\r\nerror of assuming that if we are unable to win the command we therefore\r\nlose it. It was pointed out that this proposition, which is too often\r\nimplied in strategical discussion, denies in effect that there can be such\r\na thing as strategical defensive at sea, and ignores the fact that the\r\nnormal condition in war is for the command to be in dispute. Theory and\r\nhistory are at one on the point. Together they affirm that a Power too weak\r\nto win command by offensive operations may yet succeed in holding the\r\ncommand in dispute by assuming a general defensive attitude.\r\n\r\nThat such an attitude in itself cannot lead to any positive result at sea\r\ngoes without saying, but nevertheless even over prolonged periods it can\r\nprevent an enemy securing positive results, and so give time for the other\r\nbelligerent to dominate the situation by securing his ends ashore.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that we have been forced even for a time to adopt such an\r\nattitude, but our enemies have done so frequently to our serious annoyance\r\nand loss. In the Seven Years' War, for instance, the French by avoiding\r\noffensive operations likely to lead to a decision, and confining themselves\r\nto active defence, were able for five campaigns to prevent our reducing\r\nCanada, which was the object of the war. Had they staked the issue on a\r\ngreat fleet action in the first campaign, and had the result been against\r\nthem, we could certainly have achieved our object in half the time. In the\r\nend, of course, they failed to prevent the conquest, but during all the\r\ntime the catastrophe was postponed France had abundant opportunity of\r\ngaining offensively elsewhere territory which, as she at all events\r\nbelieved, would have compelled us to give up our conquest at the peace.\r\n\r\nAgain, in our last great naval war Napoleon by avoiding general actions was\r\nable to keep the command in dispute till by alliances and otherwise he had\r\ngathered force which he deemed sufficient to warrant a return to the\r\noffensive. Eventually that force proved unequal to the task, yet when it\r\nfailed and the command passed to his enemy, he had had time to consolidate\r\nhis power so far that the loss of his fleet seemed scarcely to affect it,\r\nand for nine years more he was able to continue the struggle.\r\n\r\nSuch examples--and there are many of them--serve to show how serious a\r\nmatter is naval defence in the hands of a great military Power with other\r\nmeans of offence. They tell us how difficult it is to deal with, and how\r\nserious therefore for even the strongest naval Power is the need to give it\r\ncareful study.\r\n\r\nAnd not for this reason only, but also because the strongest naval Power,\r\nif faced with a coalition, may find it impossible to exert a drastic\r\noffensive anywhere without temporarily reducing its force in certain areas\r\nto a point relatively so low as to permit of nothing higher than the\r\ndefensive. The leading case of such a state of affairs, which we must\r\nfurther consider presently, was our own position in the War of American\r\nIndependence, when, as we have seen, in order to secure an adequate\r\nconcentration for offence in the West Indies we were forced to reduce our\r\nhome fleet to defensive level.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, do we mean by naval defence? To arrive at a right answer we\r\nmust first clear our mind of all confusing shadows cast by the accidents of\r\nland defence. Both on land and at sea defence means of course taking\r\ncertain measures to defer a decision until military or political\r\ndevelopments so far redress the balance of strength that we are able to\r\npass to the offensive. In the operations of armies the most usual means\r\nemployed are the holding of positions and forcing our superior enemy to\r\nexhaust his strength in attacking them. Consequently the idea of military\r\ndefence is dominated by the conception of entrenched positions and\r\nfortresses.\r\n\r\nIn naval warfare this is not so. At sea the main conception is avoiding\r\ndecisive action by strategical or tactical activity, so as to keep our\r\nfleet in being till the situation develops in our favour. In the golden age\r\nof our navy the keynote of naval defence was mobility, not rest. The idea\r\nwas to dispute the control by harassing operations, to exercise control at\r\nany place or at any moment as we saw a chance, and to prevent the enemy\r\nexercising control in spite of his superiority by continually occupying his\r\nattention. The idea of mere resistance was hardly present at all.\r\nEverything was counterattack, whether upon the enemy's force or his\r\nmaritime communications. On land, of course, such methods of defence are\r\nalso well known, but they belong much more to guerilla warfare than to\r\nregular operations. In regular warfare with standing armies, however\r\nbrilliantly harassing operations and counter-attack are used, the\r\nfundamental conception is the defended or defensible position.\r\n\r\nSimilarly at sea, although the essence of defence is mobility and an\r\nuntiring aggressive spirit rather than rest and resistance, yet there also\r\ndefended and defensible positions are not excluded. But they are only used\r\nin the last resort. A fleet may retire temporarily into waters difficult of\r\naccess, where it can only be attacked at great risk, or into a fortified\r\nbase, where it is practically removed from the board and cannot be attacked\r\nat all by a fleet alone. But the occasions on which such expedients can be\r\nused at sea are far rarer than on land. Indeed except for the most\r\ntemporary purposes they can scarcely be regarded as admissible at sea,\r\nhowever great their value on land. The reason is simple. A fleet\r\nwithdrawing to such a position leaves open to the enemy the ulterior\r\nobject, which is the control of sea communications, whereas on land an army\r\nin a good position may even for a prolonged period cover the ulterior\r\nobject, which is usually territory. An army in position, moreover, is\r\nalways doing something to exhaust its opponent and redress the unfavourable\r\nbalance, but a fleet in inactivity is too often permitting the enemy to\r\ncarry on operations which tend to exhaust the resources of its own country.\r\n\r\nFor a maritime Power, then, a naval defensive means nothing but keeping the\r\nfleet actively in being-not merely in existence, but in active and vigorous\r\nlife. No phrase can better express the full significance of the idea than\r\n\"A fleet in being,\" if it be rightly understood. Unfortunately it has come\r\nto be restricted, by a misunderstanding of the circumstances in which it\r\nwas first invented, to one special class of defence. We speak of it as\r\nthough it were essentially a method of defence against invasion, and so\r\nmiss its fuller meaning. If, however, it be extended to express defence\r\nagainst any kind of maritime attack, whether against territory or sea\r\ncommunications, its broad truth will become apparent, and it will give us\r\nthe true conception of the idea as held in the British service.\r\n\r\nThe occasion on which it was first used was one that well exhibits the\r\nspecial possibilities of a naval defensive. It was in the year 1690, when,\r\nin alliance with the Dutch, we were at war with France, and though really\r\nsuperior, had been caught in a situation which placed us temporarily at a\r\ngreat disadvantage in home waters. The French by a surprising rapidity of\r\nmobilisation and concentration had stolen a march on us before either our\r\nmobilisation or our concentration was complete. King William, with the best\r\nof the army, was in Ireland dealing with a French invasion in support of\r\nJames, and a squadron of seven sail under Sir Cloudesley Shovel had been\r\ndetached into the Irish Sea to guard his communications. Another squadron,\r\nconsisting of sixteen of the line, British and Dutch, had been sent to\r\nGibraltar under Admiral Killigrew to take down the trade and to keep an eye\r\non Chateaurenault, who with a slightly inferior squadron was at Toulon. It\r\nwas assumed he would probably make a push for Brest, where the French main\r\nfleet was mobilising under the Comte de Tourville, and Killigrew had orders\r\nto follow him if he got through the Straits. Chateaurenault did get\r\nthrough; Killigrew failed to bring him to action, and instead of following\r\nhim immediately, he went into Cadiz to complete his arrangements for\r\nforwarding his outward-bound convoy and escorting the one he was to bring\r\nhome. What of course he should have done, according to the practice of more\r\nexperienced times, was to have left this work to a cruiser detachment, and\r\nfailing contact with Chateaurenault, should have closed at once to the\r\nstrategical centre with his battle-squadron.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the home fleet, which Lord Torrington was to command, was still\r\nunformed. It lay in three divisions, at the Downs, Portsmouth, and\r\nPlymouth, while a considerable part of the promised Dutch contingent had\r\nnot made its appearance. It was a splendid chance for the French to seize\r\nthe command of the Channel before the concentration could take place and to\r\ncrush the British in detail. Accordingly, on June 13th, as soon as\r\nChateaurenault had arrived, Tourville put to sea with some seventy of the\r\nline. The day before, however, Torrington, having hoisted his flag in the\r\nDowns, had massed his two main divisions at Portsmouth, and by the time\r\nTourville appeared off the Isle of Wight he had with later arrivals, both\r\nDutch and British, about fifty-six of the line in St. Helen's Road. Not\r\nknowing that the Toulon contingent had joined, he put to sea intending to\r\nfight, but on discovering the great superiority of the French, he decided\r\nin concert with his council of war to act on the defensive, and before\r\noffering battle to endeavour to secure a concentration with Killigrew and\r\nShovel and the Plymouth division by getting to the westward. If he found\r\nthis course impossible without fighting an action, his plan was to retire\r\nbefore Tourville \"even to the Gunfleet,\" where amidst the shoals of the\r\nThames estuary he felt he would have a good chance of repelling an attack\r\nwith success. There, too, he counted on being reinforced not only by the\r\nships still at Chatham, but also possibly by ships from the westward which\r\nmight steal along the coast and join him \"over the flats\" by channels\r\nunknown to the French. To fight as he was he considered to be only playing\r\nthe enemy's game. \"If we are beaten,\" he said in communicating his plan to\r\nthe Government, \"they being absolute masters of the sea will be at great\r\nliberty of doing many things which they dare not do whilst we observe them\r\nand are in a possibility of joining Admiral Killigrew and our ships to the\r\nwestward.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a plan conceived on the best principles of defence--waiting till the\r\nacquisition of fresh force justified a return to the offensive. It is\r\nfurther interesting as a pure case of naval defence, with no ulterior\r\nobject other than control of home waters. In the minds of the Government\r\nthere was no apprehension of any definite attempt to invade across the\r\nChannel, but the invasion of Ireland was in full progress, and all\r\nnourishment of it must be stopped and our own communications kept free.\r\nThere was, moreover, serious anxiety lest the French should extend their\r\noperations to Scotland, and there was Killigrew's homeward-bound convoy\r\napproaching. The situation was one that obviously could not be solved\r\neffectually except by winning a general command of the sea, but in\r\nTorrington's judgment it could be rendered innocuous by holding the command\r\nin dispute. His design, therefore, was to act upon the defensive and\r\nprevent the enemy achieving any positive result until he was in a position\r\nto fight them with a fair chance of victory. A temporary defensive he\r\nconsidered was the only way to win the command, while to hazard a decision\r\nin inferior strength was the best way to lose it.\r\n\r\nNothing could be in closer harmony with the principles of good strategy as\r\nwe understand them now. It was undoubtedly in advance of anything that had\r\nbeen done up to that time, and it was little wonder if the Government, as\r\nis usually said, failed to appreciate the design. Their rejection of it has\r\ncome in for very severe criticism. But it would seem that they\r\nmisunderstood rather than failed to appreciate. The Earl of Nottingham, who\r\nwas at the head of the Government, believed, as his reply to the admiral\r\nclearly shows, that Torrington meant to retire to the Gunfleet at once;\r\nwhereas it is equally clear to us that the Gunfleet was to be his extreme\r\npoint, and that he did not mean to retire so far unless the French forced\r\nhim. The Minister failed, as others have done since, to grasp what the\r\nadmiral meant by \"A fleet in being.\" He thought that in Torrington's view a\r\nfleet safe in port and not in contact with the enemy was \"in being,\"\r\nwhereas Torrington had no such idea. As Nottingham conceived the admiral's\r\nintention he saw that although it might preserve the fleet, it would expose\r\neverything else to destruction; that is, he was oppressed with the special\r\ncharacteristic of naval warfare which always permits action against the\r\nulterior object when the enemy denies you any chance of acting against his\r\narmed force.\r\n\r\nUnder this misapprehension, which indeed was not justified by the words of\r\nTorrington's despatch, he procured from the Queen an order in these terms:\r\n\"We apprehend,\" it ran, \"the consequences of your retiring to the Gunfleet\r\nto be so fatal, that we choose rather you should upon any advantage of the\r\nwind give battle to the enemy than retreat farther than is necessary to get\r\nan advantage upon the enemy.\" It was, however, left to his discretion to\r\nproceed to the westward to complete his concentration that way, provided,\r\nit said, \"you by no means ever lose sight of the French fleet whereby they\r\nmay have opportunity of making attempts upon the shore or in the rivers of\r\nMedway or Thames, or get away without fighting.\"\r\n\r\nThis order has been very hardly dealt with by modern critics, although it\r\nclearly contemplates true preventive observation, and even, as the last\r\nwords suggest, the idea contained in Nelson's well-known saying, \"that by\r\nthe time the enemy had beat our fleet soundly they would do us no more harm\r\nthis year.\" It is true that Nelson could rely on the proved superiority of\r\nthe British at that time unit for unit, but it is also true that Nottingham\r\nand his colleagues in the Government had information which led them greatly\r\nto underestimate Tourville's strength. This was evident on the face of\r\nNottingham's despatch which covered the order, so evident indeed that\r\nTorrington might well perhaps have suspended the execution of an order so\r\nobviously based on incorrect information. But knowing probably what\r\nintrigues were going on against him at Court, he chose to regard it as a\r\nperemptory command to engage whenever he found himself to windward.\r\n\r\nMuch as a more scientific view of naval strategy may admire Torrington's\r\nconception, there seems no reason for losing temper over the Government's\r\nplan. It was certainly one way of solving the problem, and seeing how large\r\nwere our reserves, a defeat need not have meant disaster. Still, it was\r\ndoubtless dictated by an inability to grasp, the strategical strength of\r\nTorrington's novel plan, a plan which was not only safer, but was\r\ncalculated to achieve greater positive results in the end. The real fallacy\r\nof the Government's plan was that although it had a specious appearance of\r\na bold offensive, it could have achieved nothing but a negative result. The\r\nmost a battle could have given in the circumstances could only have left\r\nthe command in dispute, and the worst would have given the enemy a positive\r\nresult, which must have gravely compromised William's campaign in Ireland.\r\n\r\nOn these lines Torrington replied to the Government. Dealing with their\r\nanxiety for the ships to the westward and the Mediterranean convoy, whose\r\ndanger was their expressed reason for forbidding him the Gunfleet, he\r\npointed out that they could not run much hazard if they took care of\r\nthemselves. For, as he repeated, \"while we observe the French, they cannot\r\nmake any attempt on ships or shore without running great hazard, and if we\r\nare beaten, all is exposed to their mercy.\" Thus without specially noticing\r\nthe Minister's misinterpretation of his despatch, he intimated that his\r\nintention was observation, and not simple retreat.\r\n\r\nBy the time Torrington sent this reply he had been pressed back as far as\r\nBeachy Head; it was no longer possible to get to the westward; and the\r\nfollowing day, finding himself to windward, he attacked. But still\r\nconfirmed in his idea of defence, and carrying it on to his tactics, he\r\nrefused to give the French the chance of a real decision, and disengaged as\r\nsoon as a drop in the wind permitted. So far he felt justified in\r\ninterpreting orders which he knew were founded on false information. He was\r\nsure, as he said in justification of the way he fought the action, \"that\r\nthe Queen could not have been prevailed with to sign an order for it, had\r\nnot both our weakness and the strength of the enemy been disguised to her.\"\r\n\r\nSo severely was his fleet crippled that he believed his plan could no\r\nlonger act. \"What the consequences of this unfortunate battle may be,\" he\r\nwrote in his Journal, \"God Almighty only knows, but this I dare be positive\r\nin, had I been left to my liberty I had prevented any attempt upon the\r\nland, and secured the western ships, Killigrew, and the merchantmen.\"\r\nActually in all this he was successful. Slowly retiring eastward he drew\r\nthe French after him as far as Dover before he ran to the Nore; and\r\nTourville was unable to get back to the westward, till all the endangered\r\nships were safe in Plymouth. In spite of Torrington's being forced to fight\r\nan action at the wrong time and place, his design had so far succeeded. Not\r\nonly had he prevented the French doing anything that could affect the issue\r\nof the war, but he had completely foiled Tourville's plan of destroying the\r\nBritish fleet in detail. That he had done, but retribution by passing to\r\nthe offensive was no longer in his power.\r\n\r\nThat Tourville or his Government was impressed with the efficacy of the\r\nmethod was demonstrated the following year, when he in his turn found\r\nhimself in an inferiority that denied him hope of a successful battle\r\ndecision. During the summer he kept his fleet hovering off the mouth of the\r\nChannel without giving the British admiral a chance of contact. His method,\r\nhowever, differed from that of Torrington, and he only achieved his\r\nnegative object by keeping out of sight of his enemy altogether. In his\r\nopinion, if a fleet remained at sea in close observation of an active enemy\r\nan action could not be avoided. \"If (the admiral),\" he wrote in his\r\nmemorandum on the subject, \"be ordered to keep the sea to try to amuse the\r\nenemy and to let them know we are in a position to attack in case they\r\nattempt a descent, I think it my duty to say that in that case we must make\r\nup our mind to have to fight them in the end; for if they have really\r\nsought an action, they will have been able to fight, seeing that it is\r\nimpossible to pirouette so long near a fleet without coming to grips.\"[20]\r\nThis is as much as to say that a sure point of temporary retreat is\r\nnecessary to \"a fleet in being,\" and this was an essential part of\r\nTorrington's idea.\r\n\r\n  [20] Delarbre, _Tourville et la marine de son temps_, p. 339. (Author's\r\n  note.)\r\n\r\nIn Torrington's and Tourville's time, when ships were unhandy and fleet\r\ntactics in their infancy, the difficulty of avoiding action, when a\r\ndetermined enemy had once got contact, were undoubtedly great, unless a\r\nport of retreat was kept open. But as the art of naval warfare developed,\r\nthe possibilities of \"a fleet in being\" were regarded as much wider, at\r\nleast in the British service. It was nearly a hundred years before we were\r\nagain forced to use the same device on a large scale, and then it was\r\nbelieved that superior speed and tactical precision were factors that could\r\nbe counted on to an almost unlimited extent. In the darkest days of the War\r\nof American Independence we have a memorandum of the subject by Kempenfelt,\r\nwhich not only gives the developed idea of \"a fleet in being\" and the high\r\naggressive spirit that is its essence, but also explains its value, not\r\nmerely as a defensive expedient, but as a means of permitting a drastic\r\noffensive even when you are as a whole inferior. \"When you know the enemy's\r\ndesigns,\" he says, \"in order to do something effectual you must endeavour\r\nto be superior to them in some part where they have designs to execute, and\r\nwhere, if they succeed, they would most injure you. If your fleet is\r\ndivided as to be in all places inferior to the enemy, they will have a fair\r\nchance of succeeding everywhere in their attempts. If a squadron cannot be\r\nformed sufficient to face the enemy's at home, it would be more\r\nadvantageous to let your inferiority be still greater in order by it to\r\ngain the superiority elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"When inferior to the enemy, and you have only a squadron of observation to\r\nwatch and attend upon their motions, such a squadron should be composed of\r\ntwo-decked ships only [that is, ships of the highest mobility] as to assure\r\nit purpose. It must have the advantage of the enemy in sailing, else under\r\ncertain circumstances it will be liable to be forced to battle or to give\r\nup some of its heavy sailers. It is highly necessary to have such a flying\r\nsquadron to hang on the enemy's large fleet, as it will prevent their\r\ndividing into separate squadrons for intercepting your trade or spreading\r\ntheir ships for a more extensive view. You will be at hand to profit from\r\nany accidental separation or dispersion of their fleet from hard gales,\r\nfogs, or other causes. You may intercept supplies, intelligence, &c, sent\r\nto them. In fine, such a squadron will be a check and restraint upon their\r\nmotions, and prevent a good deal of the mischief they might otherwise do.\"\r\n\r\nThree years before, when first called to be Chief of the Staff in the\r\nChannel, he had emphasised the same points. \"Much,\" he wrote in July 1779,\r\n\"I may say all, depends upon this fleet. 'Tis an inferior against a\r\nsuperior fleet. Therefore the greatest skill and address is requisite to\r\ncounteract the designs of the enemy, to watch and seize the favourable\r\nopportunity for action, and to catch the advantage of making the effort at\r\nsome or other feeble part of the enemy's line; or if such opportunities\r\ndon't offer, to hover near the enemy, keep him at bay, and prevent his\r\nattempting anything but at risk and hazard; to command their attention, and\r\noblige them to think of nothing but being on their guard against your\r\nattack.\"[21]\r\n\r\n  [21] _Barham Papers_, i, 292.\r\n\r\nIt was on these lines the war was conducted. The West Indian area, in which\r\nlay the enemy's principal object, was treated as the offensive theatre and\r\nthe home waters as the defensive. Inferior as was the Channel fleet to the\r\nhome fleet of the allies, its defensive operations proved adequate to\r\nprevent their achieving any success. Nor was this all, for Kempenfelt was\r\nable to demonstrate the positive side of his theory in the most brilliant\r\nand convincing manner. In dealing with concentration we have seen how, in\r\ncommand of such a flying squadron as he postulated, he was able off Ushant\r\nto seize a favourable opportunity for action, which resulted in his\r\ncapturing a convoy of military stores essential to the French operations in\r\nthe West Indies under the nose of De Guichen with an escort of nearly twice\r\nhis force.\r\n\r\nNelson certainly shared Kempenfelt's views as to the possibilities of an\r\ninferior fleet kept actively in being. \"As to our fleet,\" he wrote from the\r\nMediterranean in 1796, \"under such a commander-in-chief as Sir John Jervis\r\nnobody has any fear ... We are now twenty-two sail of the line. The\r\ncombined fleet will not be above thirty-five.... I will venture my life Sir\r\nJohn Jervis defeats them. I do not mean by a regular battle, but by the\r\nskill of our admiral and the activity and spirit of our officers and\r\nseamen. This country is the most favourable possible for that skill with an\r\ninferior fleet; for the winds are so variable, that some one time in\r\ntwenty-four hours you must be able to attack a part of a large fleet, and\r\nthe other will be becalmed or have a contrary wind. Therefore I hope the\r\nGovernment will not be alarmed for our safety.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a conception of the defensive may indeed be said to have become\r\ncurrent in the British service. It was part of the reasoning which in 1805,\r\nafter Villeneuve's escape from the Mediterranean, decided Sir John Orde to\r\nfall back on Ushant instead of entering the Straits. \"I dare believe,\" he\r\nwrote, \"Lord Nelson will be found in condition with his twelve of the line\r\nand numerous frigates to act on the defensive without loss and even to hang\r\non to the skirts of the enemy's fleet should it attempt any material\r\nservice, especially when encumbered with troops.\"\r\n\r\nIn all this consideration of the potentialities of \"a fleet in being\"\r\noperating defensively it must never be forgotten that we are dealing with\r\nits possibilities in relation to a general command of the sea--to its\r\ngeneral power of holding such command in dispute, as Torrington used it.\r\nIts power of preventing a particular operation, such as oversea invasion,\r\nis another matter, which will always depend upon the local conditions. If\r\nthe \"fleet in being\" can be contained in such a way that it is impossible\r\nfor it to reach the invading line of passage, it will be no bar to\r\ninvasion. In 1690, so far as Torrington's fleet was concerned, the French,\r\nhad they been so minded, might have made a descent, say, at Portsmouth\r\nwhile Torrington was at the Nore. But Torrington's fleet was not the only\r\nfactor. His retreat forced Tourville to leave behind him unfought the\r\nsquadrons of Shovel and Killigrew, and so far as commanding a line of\r\ninvasion passage was concerned Tourville was himself as well contained as\r\nTorrington. The conditions of naval defence against invasion are in fact so\r\ncomplex compared with those of general naval defence that they must be\r\ntreated later as a special branch of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the \"Fleet in being\" as formulated and practised by\r\nTorrington and developed by Kempenfelt goes no further than this, that\r\nwhere the enemy regards the general command of a sea area as necessary to\r\nhis offensive purposes, you may be able to prevent his gaining such command\r\nby using your fleet defensively, refusing what Nelson called a regular\r\nbattle, and seizing every opportunity for a counterstroke. To use it as it\r\nwas used by the French in the case of Tourville's famous deterrent cruise,\r\nwhere the whole object of the French was offensive and could not be\r\nobtained except by offence, is quite another thing.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed difficult to understand the admiration with which his\r\n_campagne au large_ has been treated in France. He kept the sea off the\r\nmouth of the Channel for fifty days in the summer of 1691, and for forty of\r\nthose days our Channel fleet was making no systematic effort to seek him\r\nout. He had been sent to sea in hope of intercepting our great \"Smyrna\r\nconvoy,\" which was then the backbone of our oversea trade. Russell with the\r\nBritish main fleet simply took positions to cover its approach until it was\r\nsafe, knowing presumably that Tourville must come to him if he wished to\r\naccomplish his purpose. When the convoy was safe Russell proceeded off\r\nUshant, that is, between the enemy and his base. Tourville's communications\r\nwere thus cut, his line of retreat threatened, and he seized the first\r\nopportunity to elude Russell and to return into port. Beyond taking a few\r\nships from one of the West India convoys, he accomplished nothing. The\r\ncentral French offensive in Ireland was broken at the battle of the Boyne,\r\nand the prestige of England at sea was restored. It is true our trade\r\nsuffered in the North Sea, but this was not directly due to the\r\nconcentration which Tourville's cruise forced upon us, but rather to the\r\nfailure of the Dutch--apparently by a misunderstanding-to provide for an\r\neffective blockade of Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nTo British eyes it will seem that the heresy which was latent in\r\nTourville's instructions was a seed that choked all the finer aspirations\r\nof the French navy. In 1691 the plan of his cruise may possibly be defended\r\nas sufficiently aggressive, since, seeing how unstable was William's new\r\nthrone, a resounding blow at British trade, combined with an expected\r\nvictory in Ireland, might have been enough to upset it. But afterwards the\r\nidea was stretched to occasions it would not fit. It seems to have bred a\r\nbelief that where the object of the war plainly depended on winning a real\r\ncommand of the sea, that object could yet be attained by naval defensive\r\noperations. Many times it is true a policy which had starved the navy of\r\nFrance left no other course open to her seamen, and had they in their\r\ninferiority attempted the offensive, the end must have been swifter if not\r\nmore certain. In criticising the maritime history of France we must be\r\ncareful to distinguish policy from strategy. It was not always the\r\ndefensive strategy that was bad, but the policy that condemned her admirals\r\nto negative operations. Seeing that she was a continental Power with\r\ncontinental aspirations, it was often a policy from which her military\r\nexigencies permitted no escape. Nevertheless the policy was twice accursed:\r\nit cursed her when she was weak, and cursed her when she was strong. The\r\nprolonged use of the defensive bred a habit of mind which seems to have\r\nrendered her incapable of striking hard when she had the strength. In no\r\nother way at least can we account for the behaviour of so high-spirited a\r\nnation when her chance of revenge came in the War of American Independence.\r\n\r\nIt is here in its moral reactions lies the danger of the defensive, a\r\ndanger so insidious in its working as to tempt us never to utter the word.\r\nYet with the voice of Torrington, Kempenfelt, and Nelson in our ears, it\r\nwould be folly to ignore it for ourselves, and still more to ignore the\r\nexhausting strain its use by our enemy may impose upon us. It must be\r\nstudied, if for no other reasons than to learn how to break it down. Nor\r\nwill the study have danger, if only we keep well in view the spirit of\r\nrestless and vigilant counter-attack which Kempenfelt and Nelson regarded\r\nas its essence. True, some of the conditions which in the days of sails\r\nmade for opportunity have passed away, but many still remain. Shifts of\r\nwind and calms will no longer bring them, but weather thick or violent can\r\nyet make seamanship, nimbleness, and cohesion tell as it always did; and\r\nthere is no reason to doubt that it is still possible for hard sea-training\r\nto make \"the activity and spirit of our officers and seamen\" give the\r\nresults which Nelson so confidently expected.\r\n\r\nII. MINOR COUNTER-ATTACKS\r\n\r\nFor the weaker of two belligerents minor-attack has always exercised a\r\ncertain fascination. Where a Power was so inferior in naval force that it\r\ncould scarcely count even on disputing command by fleet operations, there\r\nremained a hope of reducing the relative inferiority by putting part of the\r\nenemy's force out of action. Such hopes were rarely realised. In 1587 Drake\r\nsucceeded in stopping the Spanish invasion by such a counter-attack on the\r\nCadiz division of the Armada while it was still unmobilised. In 1667 the\r\nDutch achieved a similar success against our Chatham division when it was\r\ndemobilised and undefended, and thereby probably secured rather more\r\nfavourable terms of peace. But it cannot be said that the old wars present\r\nany case where the ultimate question of command was seriously affected by a\r\nminor counterattack.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the torpedo, however, has given the idea a new importance\r\nthat cannot be overlooked. The degree of that importance is at present\r\nbeyond calculation. There is at least no evidence that it would be very\r\nhigh in normal conditions and between ordinarily efficient fleets. The\r\ncomparative success of the opening Japanese attack on the Port Arthur\r\nsquadron is the only case in point, and where only one case exists, it is\r\nnecessary to use extreme caution in estimating its significance. Before we\r\ncan deduce anything of permanent value we must consider very carefully both\r\nits conditions and results.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it was a new experience of a new class of weapon, and it by\r\nno means follows that the success of a new expedient will be repeated with\r\nanything like equal result. It will not be irrelevant again to recall the\r\ncase of fireships. At the outset of the sailing era in 1588, this device\r\nprepared the way for a decisive success against a fleet in the open. In the\r\nsucceeding wars the new weapon found a prominent place in the organisation\r\nof sea-going fleets, but its success was never repeated. Against ships in\r\nill-defended harbours it did occasionally produce good results, and during\r\nthe infancy of tactics its moral and even material effects in fleet actions\r\nwere frequently demonstrated. But as naval science developed and the\r\nlimitations of the weapon were more accurately measured, it was able to\r\nachieve less and less, till in the eighteenth century it was regarded as\r\nalmost negligible. Even its moral effect was lost, and it ceased to be\r\nconsidered as a battle unit.\r\n\r\nNow, if we examine closely the Port Arthur case, we shall find it pointing\r\nto the existence of certain inherent conditions not dissimilar from those\r\nwhich discredited fireships as a decisive factor in war. In spite of the\r\napparently formidable nature of a surprise attack by torpedo the\r\nindications from the one case in point are that these conditions make for\r\ngreater power in the defence than in the attack. The first condition\r\nrelates to the difficulty of locating the objective accurately. It is\r\nobvious that for this kind of operation the most precise intelligence is\r\nessential, and of all intelligence the most difficult to obtain in war is\r\nthe distribution of an enemy's fleet from day to day. The Japanese had\r\nfairly certain information that the bulk of the Port Arthur squadron was\r\nlying in the outer anchorage, but it had been constantly moving, and there\r\nwas a report that three battleships had just been detached from it. The\r\nreport was false, but the result was that of the five divisions of\r\ndestroyers which the Japanese had available, two were diverted against\r\nDalny, where no enemy was found. Such uncertainty must always exist, and in\r\nno circumstances is it likely to be less than where, as in the Japanese\r\ncase, the attack is made before declaration, and while the ordinary\r\nchannels of intelligence are still open.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is to be noted that in spite of the fact that relations for\r\nsome weeks had been highly strained, and a surprise torpedo attack was\r\nregarded as probable, the Russians had taken no precautions to confuse\r\ntheir enemy. It is obvious that measures to prevent accurate locating can,\r\nand should, be taken in such cases. We may go further. From confusing the\r\nenemy by such means it is but a step to lead him to a wrong conclusion, and\r\nto lay for him a trap which may swallow up the bulk of his destroyer force\r\nin the first hours of the war. It is to be feared, however, that the risks\r\nof such an eventuality are so great in minor counter-attacks of this\r\nnature, that it will probably be very difficult to tempt an inferior enemy\r\nto expose his flotilla in this way.\r\n\r\nThis view receives emphasis from the second point which the Port Arthur\r\ncase serves to demonstrate, and that is the great power of even the\r\nflimsiest defence against such attacks; in other words, the chances of\r\nsuccess can scarcely ever be great enough to justify the risk. Everything\r\nwas in favour of the Japanese. Orders had been issued in the Russian\r\nsquadron for two or three nights previously to prepare for a torpedo\r\nattack, but so low had discipline fallen, that the orders were obeyed in a\r\nvery perfunctory manner. Guns were not loaded, their crews were not at\r\nquarters, nor were the nets got out. The only real precaution taken was\r\nthat two destroyers and no more had been sent out as guard patrol, but even\r\nthey were forbidden to fire on anything they met until they had reported to\r\nthe admiral or had themselves been fired on. Defence against a surprise\r\nattack could scarcely have been more feeble, and yet so high was the\r\nnervous tension in the attacking force, that it proved stronger than could\r\nreasonably have been expected. The mere existence of the patrol and the\r\nnecessity of evading it threw the Japanese approach into a confusion from\r\nwhich it was unable to recover entirely, and the attack lost its essential\r\nmomentum and cohesion. Again, defective as were the arrangements in the\r\nsquadron itself, and lax as were its training and discipline, no torpedo\r\nhits were made, so far as we can judge, after the Russian guns and\r\nsearchlights got into play.\r\n\r\nSuch development of strength in the defence seems inherent in the\r\nconditions of minor attack, and there appears to be no reason for expecting\r\nbetter results for such attacks in normal cases. But in deducing principles\r\nfrom the Port Arthur case, it must always be remembered that it was far\r\nfrom normal. It was a blow before declaration, when the menace of strained\r\nrelations, though realised, had been almost entirely ignored by the\r\nRussians. In such exceptional and almost incredible circumstances a minor\r\nattack might always be counted on for a certain measure of success. To this\r\nwe have to add the fact that the Russian squadron was not ordinarily\r\nefficient, but appears to have fallen into a lax condition such as could\r\nscarcely recur in the case of any other naval Power.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must ask what, with every condition abnormally in favour of the\r\nattack, was the actual material result? Did it have any real influence on\r\nthe ultimate question of command? It is true that it so far swung the\r\nbalance in favour of the Japanese that they were able to exercise the local\r\ncontrol long enough to land their troops and isolate Port Arthur. But the\r\nJapanese plan for securing ultimate command rested on their power of taking\r\nPort Arthur by military operation and sustaining the siege from the sea.\r\nYet in spite of every condition of success the physical effect of the blow\r\nwas so small, that even without the help of an adequate dockyard the\r\nsquadron recovered from it and became potent again before the siege could\r\neven be formed. The minor attacks which followed the first blow were all\r\nfailures, and whether delivered at the port or upon the squadron in the\r\nopen had no appreciable effect whatever.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be remembered that since that war the art of\r\ntorpedo warfare has developed very rapidly. Its range and offensive power\r\nhave increased in a higher ratio than the means of resisting it. Still\r\nthose means have advanced, and it is probable that a squadron in a naval\r\nport or in a properly defended anchorage is not more easy to injure than it\r\never was; while a squadron at sea, so long as it constantly shifts its\r\nposition, still remains very difficult to locate with sufficient precision\r\nfor successful minor attack.\r\n\r\nThe unproved value of submarines only deepens the mist which overhangs the\r\nnext naval war. From a strategical point of view we can say no more than\r\nthat we have to count with a new factor, which gives a new possibility to\r\nminor counterattack. It is a possibility which on the whole tells in favour\r\nof naval defence, a new card which, skilfully played in combination with\r\ndefensive fleet operations, may lend fresh importance to the \"Fleet in\r\nbeing.\" It may further be expected that whatever the effective\r\npossibilities of minor operations may ultimately prove to be in regard to\r\nsecuring command, the moral influence will be considerable, and at least at\r\nthe beginning of a future war will tend to deflect and hamper the major\r\noperations and rob of their precision the lines which formerly led so\r\nfrankly to the issue by battle.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a sufficient volume of experience it would be idle to go\r\nfurther, particularly as torpedo attack, like fireship attack, depends for\r\nsuccess more than any other on the spirit and skill of officers and men.\r\nWith regard to the torpedo as the typical arm of mobile coastal defence, it\r\nis a different matter. What has been said applies only to its power towards\r\nsecuring command of the sea, and not to the exercise or to disputing the\r\nexercise of command. This is a question which is concerned with defence\r\nagainst invasion, and to that we must now turn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n          METHODS OF EXERCISING COMMAND\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI. DEFENCE AGAINST INVASION\r\n\r\nIn methods of exercising command are included all operations not directly\r\nconcerned with securing command or with preventing its being secured by the\r\nenemy. We engage in exercising command whenever we conduct operations which\r\nare directed not against the enemy's battle-fleet, but to using sea\r\ncommunications for our own purposes, or to interfering with the enemy's use\r\nof them. Such operations, though logically of secondary importance, have\r\nalways occupied the larger part of naval warfare. Naval warfare does not\r\nbegin and end with the destruction of the enemy's battle-fleet, nor even\r\nwith breaking his cruiser power. Beyond all this there is the actual work\r\nof preventing his passing an army across the sea and of protecting the\r\npassage of our own military expeditions. There is also the obstruction of\r\nhis trade and the protection of our own. In all such operations we are\r\nconcerned with the exercise of command. We are using the sea, or\r\ninterfering with its use by the enemy; we are not endeavouring to secure\r\nthe use or to prevent the enemy from securing it. The two categories of\r\noperation differ radically in conception and purpose, and strategically\r\nthey are on wholly different planes.\r\n\r\nLogically, of course, operations for exercising command should follow those\r\nfor securing command; that is to say, that since the attainment of command\r\nis the special object of naval warfare, and since that command can only be\r\nobtained permanently by the destruction of the enemy's armed forces afloat,\r\nit follows that in strictness no other objects should be allowed to\r\ninterfere with our concentration of effort on the supreme end of securing\r\ncommand by destruction. War, however, is not conducted by logic, and the\r\norder of proceeding which logic prescribes cannot always be adhered to in\r\npractice. We have seen how, owing to the special conditions of naval\r\nwarfare, extraneous necessities intrude themselves which make it inevitable\r\nthat operations for exercising command should accompany as well as follow\r\noperations for securing command. War being, as it is, a complex sum of\r\nnaval, military, political, financial, and moral factors, its actuality can\r\nseldom offer to a naval staff a clean slate on which strategical problems\r\ncan be solved by well-turned syllogisms. The naval factor can never ignore\r\nthe others. From the outset one or more of them will always call for some\r\nact of exercising command which will not wait for its turn in the logical\r\nprogression. To a greater or less extent in all ordinary cases both\r\ncategories of operation will have to be put in motion from the beginning.\r\n\r\nHence the importance of realising the distinction between the two generic\r\nforms of naval activity. In the hurry and stress of war confusion between\r\nthem is easy. By keeping a firm grip upon the difference we can see at\r\nleast what we are doing. We can judge how far any given operation that may\r\nbe called for is a sacrifice of security to exercise, how far such a\r\nsacrifice may be justified, and how far the one end may be made to serve\r\nthe other. By applying the distinction as a test much error may be avoided.\r\nThe risk we take may be great, but we shall be able to weigh it accurately\r\nagainst the value of the end, and we shall take it with our eyes open and\r\nof set purpose. Above all, it will enable the Staff to settle clearly for\r\neach squadronal commander what is to be his primary objective, and what the\r\nobject or purpose of the operations entrusted to him. It is above all in\r\nthis last consideration, and particularly in the determination of the\r\nobjective, that lies the main practical value of the distinction.\r\n\r\nThis will become clear the moment we begin to consider defence against\r\ninvasion, which naturally takes the first place amongst operations for the\r\nexercise of control. Of all the current assumptions, not one is so\r\nconfusing for the finer adjustments of strategy as that which affirms that\r\nthe primary objective of our fleet is always the enemy's fleet. Of the\r\nbattle-fleet and its attendant units it is of course true, so long at least\r\nas the enemy has a battle-fleet in being. It is true, that is, of all\r\noperations for securing control, but of operations for exercising control\r\nit is not true. In the case we have now to consider-defence against\r\ninvasion-the objective of the special operations is, and always has been,\r\nthe enemy's army. On this fundamental postulate our plans for resisting\r\ninvasion have always been constructed from the year of the Armada to 1805.\r\n\r\nIn the old service tradition the point was perfectly well established.\r\nAdmirals' instructions constantly insist on the fact that the transports\r\nare the \"principal object.\" The whole disposition of the fleet during\r\nHawke's blockade in 1759 was based on keeping a firm hold on the transports\r\nin the Morbihan, and when he sought to extend his operations against the\r\nRochefort squadron, he was sharply reminded by Anson that \"the principal\r\nobject of attention at this time\" was, firstly, \"the interception of the\r\nembarkations of the enemy at Morbihan,\" and secondly, \"the keeping of the\r\nships of war from coming out of Brest.\" Similarly Commodore Warren in 1796,\r\nwhen he had the permanent frigate guard before Brest, issued orders to his\r\ncaptains that in case of encountering enemy's transports under escort they\r\nwere \"to run them down or destroy them in the most expeditious manner\r\npossible previous to attacking the ships of war, but to preserve such a\r\nsituation as to effect that purpose when directed by signal.\" Lord Keith's\r\norders when watching Napoleon's flotilla were to the same effect.\r\n\"Directing your chief attention,\" they run, \"to the destruction of the\r\nships, vessels, or boats having men, horses, or artillery on board (in\r\npreference to that of the vessels by which they are protected), and in the\r\nstrict execution of this important duty losing sight entirely of the\r\npossibility of idle censure for avoiding contact with an armed force,\r\nbecause the prevention of debarkation is the object of primary importance\r\nto which every other consideration must give way.\"[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] _Admiralty Secretary's In-Letters_, 537, 8 August 1803.\r\n\r\nIn tactics, then, the idea was the same as in strategy. The army was the\r\nprimary objective round which all dispositions turned. In the French\r\nservice the strength and soundness of the British practice was understood\r\nat least by the best men. When in 1805 Napoleon consulted Ganteaume as to\r\nthe possibility of the flotilla of transports effecting its passage by\r\nevasion, the admiral told him it was impossible, since no weather could\r\navail to relax the British hold sufficiently. \"In former wars,\" he said,\r\n\"the English vigilance was miraculous.\"\r\n\r\nTo this rule there was no exception, not even when circumstances rendered\r\nit difficult to distinguish between the enemy's fleet and army as\r\nobjectives. This situation could occur in two ways. Firstly, when the\r\ninvading army was designed to sail with the battle-fleet, as in the case of\r\nNapoleon's invasion of Egypt; and secondly, when, although the design was\r\nthat the two should operate on separate lines, our system of defence forced\r\nthe fleet to come up to the army's line of passage in order to clear it, as\r\nhappened in the case of the Armada and the French attempt of 1744.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case the invading army, whose objective was unknown, was at\r\nDunkirk, and a French fleet was coming up the Channel to cover the passage.\r\nSir John Norris, in command of the home fleet, was in the Downs. Though his\r\nname is now almost forgotten, he was one of the great founders of our naval\r\ntradition, and a strategist of the first order. In informing the Government\r\nof his plan of operations, he said he intended to proceed with his whole\r\nsquadron off Dunkirk to prevent the transports sailing. \"But,\" he says, \"if\r\nthey should unfortunately get out and pass us in the night and go\r\nnorthward, I intend to detach a superior force to endeavour to overtake and\r\ndestroy them; and with the remainder of my squadron either to fight the\r\nFrench fleet now in the Channel, or observe them and cover the country as\r\nour circumstances will admit of; or I shall pursue the embarkation with all\r\nmy strength.\" In this case there had been no time to organise a special\r\nsquadron or flotilla, in the usual way, to bar the line of passage, and the\r\nbattle-fleet had to be used for the purpose. This being so, Norris was not\r\ngoing to allow the presence of an enemy's battle-fleet to entice him away\r\nfrom his grip on the invading army, and so resolutely did he hold to the\r\nprinciple, that he meant if the transports put to sea to direct his\r\noffensive against them, while he merely contained the enemy's battle-fleet\r\nby defensive observation.\r\n\r\nIn the Egyptian case there was no distinction between the two objectives at\r\nall. Napoleon's expedition sailed in one mass. Yet in the handling of his\r\nfleet Nelson preserved the essential idea. He organised it into three\r\n\"sub-squadrons,\" one of six sail and two of four each. \"Two of these\r\nsub-squadrons,\" says Berry, his flag-captain, \"were to attack the ships of\r\nwar, while the third was to pursue the transports and to sink and destroy\r\nas many as it could\"; that is, he intended, in order to make sure of\r\nNapoleon's army, to use no more than ten, and possibly only eight, of his\r\nown battleships against the eleven of the enemy.\r\n\r\nMany other examples could be given of British insistence on making the\r\nenemy's army the primary objective and not his fleet in cases of invasion.\r\nNo point in the old tradition was more firmly established. Its value was of\r\ncourse more strongly marked where the army and the fleet of the enemy\r\nendeavoured to act on separate lines of operation; that is, where the army\r\ntook the real offensive line and the fleet the covering or preventive line,\r\nand where consequently for our own fleet there was no confusion between the\r\ntwo objectives. This was the normal case, and the reason it was so is\r\nsimple enough. It may be stated at once, since it serves to enunciate the\r\ngeneral principle upon which our traditional system of defence was based.\r\n\r\nAn invasion of Great Britain must always be an attempt over an uncommanded\r\nsea. It may be that our fleet predominates or it may be that it does not,\r\nbut the command must always be in dispute. If we have gained complete\r\ncommand, no invasion can take place, nor will it be attempted. If we have\r\nlost it completely no invasion will be necessary, since, quite apart from\r\nthe threat of invasion, we must make peace on the best terms we can get.\r\nNow, if the sea be uncommanded, there are obviously two ways in which an\r\ninvasion may be attempted. Firstly, the enemy may endeavour to force it\r\nthrough our naval defence with transports and fleet in one mass. This was\r\nthe primitive idea on which the Spanish invasion of Philip the Second was\r\noriginally planned by his famous admiral, Santa-Cruz. Ripening military\r\nscience, however, was able to convince him of its weakness. A mass of\r\ntransports and warships is the most cumbrous and vulnerable engine of war\r\never known. The weaker the naval defence of the threatened country, the\r\nmore devoutly will it pray the invader may use this device. Where contact\r\nwith the enemy's fleet is certain, and particularly in narrow seas, as it\r\nwas in this case, such a course will give the defender all the chances he\r\ncould desire, and success for the invader is inconceivable, provided always\r\nwe resolutely determine to make the army in its transports our main\r\nobjective, and are not to be induced to break our head against its escort.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, contact is not certain, the invasion over an uncommanded\r\nsea may succeed by evasion of the defender's battle-fleet, as it did in the\r\ncase of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. But that operation belongs to an\r\nentirely different category from that which we are now considering. None of\r\nthe factors on which the traditional system of British defence is based\r\nwere present. It was an operation over an open sea against a distant and\r\nundetermined objective that had no naval defence of its own, whereas in our\r\nown case the determining factors are permanent naval defence, an\r\napproximately determined objective, and a narrow sea where evasion by any\r\nforce of invasion strength is impossible. Napoleon's exploit was in fact\r\nnothing more than the evasion of an open blockade which had no naval\r\ndefence beyond it. The vital importance of these things will appear as we\r\nproceed and note the characteristics which marked every attempt to invade\r\nEngland. From such attempts we of course exclude the various descents upon\r\nIreland, which, not being of invasion strength, fall into another class, to\r\nbe dealt with hereafter.\r\n\r\nSince the expedient of forcing an invasion by the strength of a powerful\r\nbattleship escort has always been rejected as an inadmissible operation,\r\nthe invader has had no choice but to adopt a separate line for his army,\r\nand operate with his fleet in such a way as may promise to prevent the\r\nenemy controlling that line. That, in short, is the problem of invasion\r\nover an uncommanded sea. In spite of an unbroken record of failure scored\r\nat times with naval disaster, continental strategists from Parma to\r\nNapoleon have clung obstinately to the belief that there is a solution\r\nshort of a complete fleet decision. They have tried every conceivable\r\nexpedient again and again. They have tried it by simple surprise evasion\r\nand by evasion through diversion or dispersal of our naval defence. They\r\nhave tried it by seeking local control through a local naval success\r\nprepared by surprise, or by attempting to entice our fleet away from home\r\nwaters to a sufficient extent to give them temporarily local superiority.\r\nBut the end has always been the same. Try as they would, they were faced\r\nultimately by one of two alternatives--they must either defeat our covering\r\nbattle-fleet in battle, or they must close their own battle-fleet on the\r\ntransports, and so set up the very situation which it was their main design\r\nto avoid.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that all attempts to invade England without command of the\r\nsea have moved in a vicious circle, from which no escape was ever found. No\r\nmatter how ingenious or complex the enemy's design, a determined hold on\r\ntheir army as the primary naval objective has always set up a process of\r\ndegradation which rendered the enterprise impracticable. Its stages are\r\ndistinct and recurrent, and may be expressed as it were diagrammatically as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nTwo lines of operation having been decided on, the invading army is\r\ngathered at a point as close as possible to the coast to be invaded; that\r\nis, where the intervening sea is narrowest, and where the army's passage\r\nwill be exposed to interference for the shortest time. The covering fleet\r\nwill operate from a point as distant as convenient, so as to entice the\r\nenemy as far as possible from the army's line of passage. The defender\r\nreplies by blockading the army's ports of departure with a flotilla of\r\nlight vessels capable of dealing with transports, or by establishing a\r\nmobile defence of the threatened coasts which transports cannot break\r\nunaided, or more probably he will combine both expedients. The first\r\nfallacy of the invasion plan is then apparent. The narrower the sea, the\r\neasier it is to watch. Pure evasion becomes impossible, and it is necessary\r\nto give the transports sufficient armed strength by escort or otherwise to\r\nprotect them against flotilla attack. The defender at once stiffens his\r\nflotilla defence with cruisers and intermediate ships, and the invader has\r\nto arrange for breaking the barrier with a battle-squadron. So weak and\r\ndisturbing a position is then set up that the whole scheme begins to give\r\nway, if, that is, the defender has clung stubbornly to the strategy we\r\nalways used. Our battle-fleet refused to seek out that of the invader. It\r\nhas always held a position between the invader's fleet and the blockaded\r\ninvasion base, covering the blockade and flotilla defence. To enable a\r\nbattle-squadron to break our hold and to reinforce the army escort, the\r\ninvader must either force this covering position by battle, or disturb it\r\nso effectively as to permit the reinforcing squadron to evade it. But since\r\n_ex hypothesi_ he is trying to invade without securing the command by\r\nbattle, he will first try to reinforce his transport escort by evasion. At\r\nonce he is faced with new difficulty. The reinforcement entails dividing\r\nhis fleet, and this is an expedient so vicious and disturbing to morale,\r\nthat no invader has ever been found to risk it. And for this reason. To\r\nmake evasion possible for the detached squadron, he must bring up the rest\r\nof his force and engage the attention of the enemy's fleet, and thus unless\r\nhe is in very great superiority, and by hypothesis is not--he runs the\r\nhazard of having his two divisions beaten in detail. This method has\r\nsometimes been urged by Governments, but so loud have been the protests\r\nboth from the fleet and the army, that it has always been dropped, and the\r\ninvader finds himself at the end of the vicious circle. Unable to reinforce\r\nhis transport escort sufficiently without dividing his battle-fleet, he is\r\nforced to bring his whole force up to the army or abandon the attempt till\r\ncommand shall have been secured by battle.\r\n\r\nThus the traditional British system has never failed to bring about the\r\ndeadlock, and it will be observed it is founded on making the invading army\r\nthe primary objective. We keep a hold on it, firstly, by flotilla blockade\r\nand defence stiffened as circumstances may dictate by higher units, and\r\nsecondly, by battle-fleet cover. It is on the flotilla hold that the whole\r\nsystem is built up. It is the local danger to that hold which determines\r\nthe amount of stiffening the flotilla demands, and it is the security of\r\nthat hold which determines the position and action of the battle-fleet.\r\n\r\nA few typical examples will serve to show how the system worked in practice\r\nunder all kinds of conditions. The first scientific attempt to work on two\r\nlines of operation, as distinguished from the crude mass methods of the\r\nMiddle Ages, was the Spanish enterprise of 1588. Though internal support\r\nfrom Catholic malcontents was expected, it was designed as a true invasion,\r\nthat is, a continuing operation for permanent conquest. Parma, the military\r\ncommander-in-chief, laid it down that the Spanish fleet would have not only\r\nto protect his passage and support his landing, but also \"to keep open his\r\ncommunications for the flow of provisions and munition.\"\r\n\r\nIn advising the dual line of operation, Parma's original intention was to\r\nget his army across by surprise. As always, however, it proved impossible\r\nto conceal the design, and long before he was ready he found himself\r\nsecurely blockaded by a Dutch flotilla supported by an English squadron. So\r\nfirm indeed was the English hold on the army, that for a time it was\r\noverdone. The bulk of the English fleet was kept on the line of passage\r\nunder Howard, while Drake alone was sent to the westward. It was only under\r\nthe great sailor's importunity that the disposition, which was to become\r\ntraditional, was perfected, and the whole fleet, with the exception of the\r\nsquadron supporting the flotilla blockade, was massed in a covering\r\nposition to the westward. The normal situation was then set up, and it\r\ncould only have one result. Surprise was out of the question. Parma could\r\nnot move till the blockade was broken, nor in face of the covering fleet\r\ncould the Spanish fleet hope to break it by a sudden intrusion. The vague\r\nprospects the Spaniards had conceived of keeping the English fleet away\r\nfrom the line of passage by threatening a descent in the West Country or\r\nblockading it in a western port would no longer do. No such expedient would\r\nrelease Parma, and the Duke of Medina-Sidonia was ordered to proceed direct\r\nto Dunkirk if possible without fighting, there to break the blockade and\r\nsecure the passage.\r\n\r\nThere was some idea in the King's mind that he would be able to do this\r\nwithout a battle, but Parma and every seasoned Spanish sailor knew that the\r\nEnglish fleet would have to be totally defeated before the transports could\r\nventure out of port. Such a battle was indeed inevitable, and the English\r\ndispositions secured that the Spaniards would have to fight it under every\r\ndisadvantage which was inherent in the plan of dual lines of operation. The\r\nEnglish would secure certain contact at such a distance from the line of\r\npassage as would permit prolonged harassing attacks in waters unfamiliar to\r\nthe enemy and close to their own sources of support and supply. No battle\r\nto the death would be necessary until the Spaniards were herded into the\r\nconfined and narrow waters which the army's passage demanded, and where\r\nboth sections of the British fleet would be massed for the final struggle.\r\nThey must arrive there dispirited with indecisive actions and with the\r\nterrors of unknown and difficult seas at the highest point. All this was no\r\nmatter of chance. It was inherent in the strategical and geographical\r\nconditions. The English dispositions had taken every advantage of them, and\r\nthe result was that not only was the Spanish army unable even to move, but\r\nthe English advantages in the final battle were so great, that it was only\r\na lucky shift of wind that saved the Armada from being driven to total\r\ndestruction upon the Dutch banks.\r\n\r\nIn this case, of course, there had been ample time to make the necessary\r\ndispositions. It will be well to follow it with an example in which\r\nsurprise came as near to being complete as it is possible to conceive, and\r\nwhere the arrangements for defence had to be improvised on the spur of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nA case in point was the French attempt of 1744. In that year everything was\r\nin favour of the invader. England was undermined with Jacobite sedition;\r\nScotland was restless and threatening; the navy had sunk to what is\r\nuniversally regarded as its worst for spirit, organisation, and command;\r\nand the government was in the hands of the notorious \"Drunken\r\nAdministration.\" For three years we had been making unsuccessful war with\r\nSpain, and had been supporting Maria Theresa on the Continent against\r\nFrance, with the result that our home defence was reduced to its lowest\r\nebb. The navy then numbered 183 sail--about equal to that of France and\r\nSpain combined--but owing to the strain of the war in the Mediterranean and\r\nTransatlantic stations only forty-three, including eighteen of the line,\r\nwere available for home waters. Even counting all cruising ships \"within\r\ncall,\" as the phrase then was, the Government had barely one-fourth of the\r\nfleet at hand to meet the crisis. With the land forces it was little\r\nbetter. Considerably more than half the home army was abroad with the King,\r\nwho was assisting the Empress-Queen as Elector of Hanover. Between France\r\nand England, however, there was no war. In the summer the King won the\r\nbattle of Dettingen; a formal alliance with Maria Theresa followed in the\r\nautumn; France responded with a secret alliance with Spain; and to prevent\r\nfurther British action on the Continent, she resolved to strike a blow at\r\nLondon in combination with a Jacobite insurrection. It was to be a \"bolt\r\nfrom the blue\" before declaration and in mid-winter, when the best ships of\r\nthe home fleet were laid up. The operation was planned on dual lines, the\r\narmy to start from Dunkirk, the covering fleet from Brest.\r\n\r\nThe surprise was admirably designed. The port of Dunkirk had been destroyed\r\nunder the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, and though the French had been\r\nrestoring it secretly for some time, it was still unfit to receive a fleet\r\nof transports. In spite of the warnings of Sir John Norris, the senior\r\nadmiral in the service, the assembling of troops in its neighbourhood from\r\nthe French army in Flanders could only be taken for a movement into winter\r\nquarters, and that no suspicion might be aroused the necessary transports\r\nwere secretly taken up in other ports under false charter-parties, and were\r\nonly to assemble off Dunkirk at the last moment. With equal skill the\r\npurpose of the naval mobilisation at Brest was concealed. By false\r\ninformation cleverly imparted to our spies and by parade of victualling for\r\na long voyage, the British Government was led to believe that the main\r\nfleet was intended to join the Spaniards in the Mediterranean, while a\r\ndetachment, which was designed to escort the transports, was ostensibly\r\nequipped for a raid in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nSo far as concealment was concerned the arrangement was perfect. Yet it\r\ncontained within it the fatal ingredient. The army was to strike in the\r\nThames at Tilbury; but complete as was the secrecy, Marshal Saxe, who was\r\nto command, could not face the passage without escort. There were too many\r\nprivateers and armed merchantmen always in the river, besides cruisers\r\nmoving to and fro on commerce-protection duty. The division, therefore,\r\nwhich we supposed to be for the West Indies was to be detached from the\r\nBrest fleet after it entered the Channel and was to proceed to join the\r\ntransports off Dunkirk, while the Marquis de Roquefeuil with the main fleet\r\nheld what British ships might be ready in Portsmouth either by battle or\r\nblockade.\r\n\r\nNothing could look simpler or more certain of success. The British\r\nGovernment seemed quite asleep. The blow was timed for the first week in\r\nJanuary, and it was mid-December before they even began to watch Brest with\r\ncruisers regularly. On these cruisers' reports measures were taken to\r\nprepare an equal squadron for sea by the new year. By this time nearly\r\ntwenty of the line were ready or nearly so at the Nore, Portsmouth, and\r\nPlymouth, and a press was ordered to man them. Owing to various causes the\r\nFrench had now to postpone their venture. Finally it was not till February\r\n6th that Roquefeuil was seen to leave Brest with nineteen of the line. The\r\nnews reached London on the 12th, and next day Norris was ordered to hoist\r\nhis flag at Spithead. His instructions were \"to take the most effectual\r\nmeasures to prevent the making of any descent upon the kingdoms.\" It was\r\nnothing but news that the young Pretender had left Rome for France that led\r\nto this precaution. The Government had still no suspicion of what was\r\nbrewing at Dunkirk. It was not till the 20th that a Dover smuggler brought\r\nover information which at last opened their eyes.\r\n\r\nA day or two later the French transports were seen making for Dunkirk, and\r\nwere mistaken for the Brest fleet. Orders were consequently sent down to\r\nNorris to follow them. In vain he protested at the interference. He knew\r\nthe French were still to the westward of him, but his orders were repeated,\r\nand he had to go. Tiding it up-Channel against easterly winds, he reached\r\nthe Downs and joined the Nore Division there on the 28th. History usually\r\nspeaks of this false movement as the happy chance which saved the country\r\nfrom invasion. But it was not so. Saxe had determined not to face the\r\nThames ships without escort. They were ample to destroy him had he done so.\r\nIn truth the move which the Government forced on Norris spoilt the campaign\r\nand prevented his destroying the Brest fleet as well as stopping the\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nRoquefeuil had just received his final orders off the Start. He was\r\ninstructed by all possible means to bring the main British fleet to action,\r\nor at least to prevent further concentration, while he was also to detach\r\nthe special division of four of the line under Admiral Barraille to Dunkirk\r\nto escort the transports. It was in fact the inevitable order, caused by\r\nour hold on the army, to divide the fleet. Both officers as usual began to\r\nbe upset, and as with Medina-Sidonia, they decided to keep company till\r\nthey reached the Isle of Wight and remain there till they could get touch\r\nwith Saxe and pilots for the Dover Strait. They were beset with the\r\nnervousness that seems inseparable from this form of operation. Roquefeuil\r\nexplained to his Government that it was impossible to tell what ships the\r\nenemy had passed to the Downs, and that Barraille when he arrived off\r\nDunkirk might well find himself in inferiority. He ended in the usual way\r\nby urging that the whole fleet must move in a body to the line of passage.\r\nOn arriving off Portsmouth, however, a reconnaissance in thick weather led\r\nhim to believe that the whole of Norris's fleet was still there, and he\r\ntherefore detached Barraille, who reached Dunkirk in safety.\r\n\r\nNot knowing that Norris was in the Downs, Saxe began immediately to embark\r\nhis troops, but bad weather delayed the operation for three days, and so\r\nsaved the expedition, exposed as it was in the open roads, from destruction\r\nby an attack which Norris was on the point of delivering with his flotilla\r\nof fireships and bomb vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Brest squadron had an equally narrow escape. Saxe and his staff having\r\nheard rumours of Norris's movement to the Downs had become seized with the\r\nsea-sickness which always seems to afflict an army as it waits to face the\r\ndangers of an uncommanded passage. They too wanted the whole fleet to\r\nescort them, and orders had been sent to Roquefeuille to do as he had\r\nsuggested. All unconscious of Norris's presence in the Downs with a score\r\nof the line more powerful than his own, he came on with the fifteen he had\r\nstill with his flag to close on Barraille. Norris was informed of his\r\napproach, and it was now he wrote his admirable appreciation, already\r\nquoted, for dealing with the situation.\r\n\r\n\"As I think it,\" he said, \"of the greatest consequence to his Majesty's\r\nservice to prevent the landing of these troops in any part of the country,\r\nI have ... determined to anchor without the sands of Dunkirk, where we\r\nshall be in the fairest way for keeping them in.\" That is, he determined to\r\nkeep hold of the army regardless of the enemy's fleet, and as Saxe's\r\nobjective was not quite certain, he would do it by close blockade. \"But\r\nif,\" he continued, \"they should unfortunately get out and pass in the night\r\nand go northward [that is, for Scotland], I intend to detach a superior\r\nforce to endeavour to overtake and destroy them, and with the remainder of\r\nmy squadron either fight the French fleet now in the Channel, or observe\r\nthem and cover the country as our circumstances will admit of; or I shall\r\npursue the embarkation [that is, follow the transports] with all my\r\nstrength.\" This meant he would treat the enemy's army offensively and their\r\nfleet defensively, and his plan was entirely approved by the King.\r\n\r\nAs to which of the two plans he would adopt, the inference is that his\r\nchoice would depend on the strength of the enemy, for it was reported the\r\nRochefort squadron had joined Roquefeuille. The doubt was quickly settled.\r\nOn the morrow he heard that Roquefeuille was at Dungeness with only fifteen\r\nof the line. In a moment he seized all the advantage of the interior\r\nposition which Roquefeuille's necessity to close on the army had given him.\r\nWith admirable insight he saw there was time to fling his whole force at\r\nthe enemy's fleet without losing his hold on the army's line of passage.\r\nThe movement was made immediately. The moment the French were sighted\r\n\"General chase\" was signalled, and Roquefeuille was within an ace of being\r\nsurprised at his anchorage when a calm stopped the attack. The calm was\r\nsucceeded by another furious gale, in which the French escaped in a\r\ndisastrous _sauve qui peut_, and the fleet of transports was destroyed. The\r\noutcome of it all was not only the failure of the invasion, but that we\r\nsecured the command of home waters for the rest of the war.\r\n\r\nThe whole attempt, it will be seen, with everything in its favour, had\r\nexhibited the normal course of degradation. For all the nicely framed plan\r\nand the perfect deception, the inherent difficulties, when it came to the\r\npoint of execution, had as usual forced a clumsy concentration of the\r\nenemy's battle-fleet with his transports, and we on our part were able to\r\nforestall it with every advantage in our favour by the simple expedient of\r\na central mass on a revealed and certain line of passage.\r\n\r\nIn the next project, that of 1759, a new and very clever plan was devised\r\nfor turning the difficulty. The first idea of Marshal Belleisle, like that\r\nof Napoleon, was to gather the army at Ambleteuse and Boulogne, and to\r\navoid the assemblage of transports by passing it across the Strait by\r\nstealth in flat boats. But this idea was abandoned before it had gone very\r\nfar for something much more subtle. The fallacious advantage of a short\r\npassage was dropped, and the army was to start from three widely separated\r\npoints all in more open waters--a diversionary raid from Dunkirk and two\r\nmore formidable forces from Havre and the Morbihan in South Brittany. To\r\nsecure sufficient control there was to be a concentration on the Brest\r\nfleet from the Mediterranean and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe new feature, it will be observed, was that our covering fleet--that is,\r\nthe Western Squadron off Brest--would have two cruiser blockades to secure,\r\none on either side of it. Difficult as the situation looked, it was solved\r\non the old lines. The two divisions of the French army at Dunkirk and\r\nMorbihan were held by cruiser squadrons capable of following them over the\r\nopen sea if by chance they escaped, while the third division at Havre,\r\nwhich had nothing but flat boats for transport, was held by a flotilla well\r\nsupported. Its case was hopeless. It could not move without a squadron to\r\nrelease it, and no fortune of weather could possibly bring a squadron from\r\nBrest. Hawke, who had the main blockade, might be blown off, but he could\r\nscarcely fail to bring to action any squadron that attempted to enter the\r\nChannel. With the Morbihan force it was different. Any time that Hawke was\r\nblown off a squadron could reach it from Brest and break the cruiser\r\nblockade. The French Government actually ordered a portion of the fleet to\r\nmake the attempt. Conflans however, who was in command, protested his force\r\nwas too weak to divide, owing to the failure of the intended concentration.\r\nBoscawen had caught and beaten the Mediterranean squadron off Lagos, and\r\nthough the West Indian squadron got in, it proved, as in Napoleon's great\r\nplan of concentration, unfit for further service. The old situation had\r\narisen, forced by the old method of defence; and in the end there was\r\nnothing for it but for Conflans to take his whole fleet to the Morbihan\r\ntransports. Hawke was upon him at once, and the disastrous day of Quiberon\r\nwas the result. The Dunkirk division alone got free, but the smallness of\r\nits size, which permitted it to evade the watch, also prevented its doing\r\nany harm. Its escort, after landing its handful of troops in Ireland, was\r\nentirely destroyed; and so again the attempt of the French to invade over\r\nan uncommanded sea produced no effect but the loss of their fleet.\r\n\r\nThe project of 1779 marked these principles even more strongly, for it\r\ndemonstrated them working even when our home fleet was greatly inferior to\r\nthat of the enemy. In this case the invader's idea was to form two\r\nexpeditionary forces at Cherbourg and Havre, and under cover of an\r\noverwhelming combination of the Spanish and French fleets, to unite them at\r\nsea and seize Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. It was in the early summer\r\nwe got wind of the scheme, and two cruiser squadrons and flotillas were at\r\nonce formed at the Downs and Channel Islands to watch the French coasts and\r\nprevent the concentration of transports. Spain had not yet declared war,\r\nbut she was suspected, and the main fleet, under the veteran Sir Charles\r\nHardy, who had been Norris's second in command in 1744, was ordered to\r\nproceed off Brest and prevent any Spanish squadron that might appear from\r\nentering that port. The French, however, outmanoeuvred us by putting to sea\r\nbefore Hardy could reach his station and forming a junction with the\r\nSpaniards off Finisterre. The combined fleet contained about fifty of the\r\nline, nearly double our own. The army of invasion, with Dumouriez for its\r\nChief of the Staff, numbered some 50,000 men, a force we were in no\r\ncondition to meet ashore. Everything, therefore, was in favour of success,\r\nand yet in the navy, at least, a feeling of confidence prevailed that no\r\ninvasion could take place.\r\n\r\nThe brains of the naval defence were Lord Barham (then Sir Charles\r\nMiddleton) at the Admiralty and Kempenfelt as Chief of the Staff in the\r\nfleet; and it is to their correspondence at this time that we owe some of\r\nthe most valuable strategical appreciations we possess. The idea of the\r\nFrench was to come into the Channel in their overwhelming force, and while\r\nthey destroyed or held Hardy, to detach a sufficient squadron to break the\r\ncruiser blockade and escort the troops across. Kempenfelt was confident\r\nthat it could not be done. He was sure that the unwieldy combined mass\r\ncould be rendered powerless by his comparatively homogeneous and mobile\r\nfleet, inferior as it was, so long as he could keep it at sea and to the\r\nwestward. The appreciation of the power of a nimble inferior fleet which he\r\nwrote at this time has already been given.[23] When the worst of the\r\nposition was fully known, and the enemy was reported off the mouth of the\r\nChannel, he wrote another to Middleton. His only doubt was whether his\r\nfleet had the necessary cohesion and mobility. \"We don't seem,\" he said,\r\n\"to have considered sufficiently a certain fact that the comparative force\r\nof two fleets depends much upon their sailing. The fleet that sails fastest\r\nhas much the advantage, as they can engage or not as they please, and so\r\nhave always in their power to choose the favourable opportunity to attack.\r\nI think I may safely hazard an opinion that twenty-five sail of the line\r\ncoppered would be sufficient to harass and tease this great unwieldy\r\ncombined Armada so as to prevent their effecting anything, hanging\r\ncontinually upon them, ready to catch at any opportunity of a separation\r\nfrom night, gale or fog, to dart upon the separated, to cut off convoys of\r\nprovisions coming to them, and if they attempted an invasion, to oblige\r\ntheir whole fleet to escort the transports, and even then it would be\r\nimpossible to protect them entirely from so active and nimble a fleet.\"\r\n\r\n  [23] _Supra_, p. 222.\r\n\r\nHere we have from the pen of one of the greatest masters the real key of\r\nthe solution--the power, that is, of forcing the mass of the enemy's fleet\r\nto escort the transports. Hardy, of course, knew it well from his\r\nexperience of 1744, and acted accordingly. This case is the more striking,\r\nsince defence against the threatened invasion was not the whole of the\r\nproblem he had to solve. It was complicated by instructions that he must\r\nalso prevent a possible descent on Ireland, and cover the arrival of the\r\ngreat convoys. In reply, on August 1st, he announced his intention of\r\ntaking station ten to twenty leagues W.S.W. of Scilly, \"which I am of\r\nopinion,\" he said, \"is the most proper station for the security of the\r\ntrade expected from the East and West Indies, and for the meeting of the\r\nfleets of the enemy _should they attempt to come into the Channel_.\" He\r\nunderlined the last words, indicating, apparently, his belief that they\r\nwould not venture to do so so long as he could keep his fleet to the\r\nwestward and undefeated. This at least he did, till a month later he found\r\nit necessary to come in for supplies. Then, still avoiding the enemy, he\r\nran not to Plymouth, but right up to St. Helen's. The movement is always\r\nregarded as an unworthy retreat, and it caused much dissatisfaction in the\r\nfleet at the time. But it is to be observed that his conduct was strictly\r\nin accordance with the principle which makes the invading army the primary\r\nobjective. If Hardy's fleet was no longer fit to keep the sea without\r\nreplenishment, then the proper place to seek replenishment was on the\r\ninvader's line of passage. So long as he was there, invasion could not take\r\nplace till he was defeated. The allies, it was true, were now free to join\r\ntheir transports, but the prospect of such a movement gave the admiral no\r\nuneasiness, for it would bring him the chance of serving his enemy as the\r\nSpaniards were served in 1588. \"I shall do my utmost,\" he said, \"to drive\r\nthem up the Channel.\" It is the old principle. If the worst comes to the\r\nworst, so long as you are able to force the covering fleet upon the\r\ntransports, and especially in narrow waters, invasion becomes an operation\r\nbeyond the endurable risks of war.\r\n\r\nSo it proved. On August 14th Count d'Orvilliers, the allied\r\ncommander-in-chief, had made the Lizard, and for a fortnight had striven to\r\nbring Hardy to decisive action. Until he had done so he dared neither enter\r\nthe Channel with his fleet nor detach a squadron to break the cruiser\r\nblockades at the invasion bases. His ineffectual efforts exhausted his\r\nfleet's endurance, which the distant concentration at Finisterre had\r\nalready severely sapped, and he was forced to return impotent to Brest\r\nbefore anything had been accomplished. The allies were not able to take the\r\nsea again that campaign, but even had it been in their power to do so,\r\nHardy and Kempenfelt could have played their defensive game indefinitely,\r\nand with ever-increasing chances, as the winter drew near, of dealing a\r\nparalysing blow.\r\n\r\nThere was never any real chance of success, though it is true Dumouriez\r\nthought otherwise. He believed the enterprise might have gone through if a\r\ndiversion had been made by the bulk of the fleet against Ireland, and under\r\ncover of it a _coup de main_ delivered upon the Isle of Wight, \"for which,\"\r\nhe said, \"six or eight of the line would have been enough.\" But it is\r\ninconceivable that old hands like Hardy and Kempenfelt would have been so\r\neasily beguiled of their hold on the line of passage. Had such a division\r\nbeen detached up the Channel from the allied fleet they would surely,\r\naccording to tradition, have followed it with either a superior force or\r\ntheir whole squadron.\r\n\r\nThe well-known projects of the Great War followed the same course. Under\r\nNapoleon's directions they ran the whole gamut of every scheme that ever\r\nraised delusive hope before. Beginning from the beginning with the idea of\r\nstealing his army across in flat-boats, he was met with the usual flotilla\r\ndefence. Then came his only new idea, which was to arm his transport\r\nflotilla to the point of giving it power to force a passage for itself. We\r\nreplied by strengthening our flotilla. Convinced by experiment that his\r\nscheme was now impracticable, he set his mind on breaking the blockade by\r\nthe sudden intrusion of a flying squadron from a distance. To this end\r\nvarious plausible schemes were worked out, but plan after plan melted in\r\nhis hand, till he was forced to face the inevitable necessity of bringing\r\nan overwhelming battle force up to his transports. The experience of two\r\ncenturies had taught him nothing. By a more distant concentration than had\r\never been attempted before he believed he could break the fatal hold of his\r\nenemy. The only result was so severely to exhaust his fleet that it never\r\ncould get within reach of the real difficulties of its task, a task which\r\nevery admiral in his service knew to be beyond the strength of the Imperial\r\nNavy. Nor did Napoleon even approach a solution of the problem he had set\r\nhimself--invasion over an uncommanded sea. With our impregnable flotilla\r\nhold covered by an automatic concentration of battle-squadrons off Ushant,\r\nhis army could never even have put forth, unless he had inflicted upon our\r\ncovering fleet such a defeat as would have given him command of the sea,\r\nand with absolute control of the sea the passage of an army presents no\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nOf the working of these principles under modern conditions we have no\r\nexample. The acquisition of free movement must necessarily modify their\r\napplication, and since the advent of steam there have been only two\r\ninvasions over uncommanded seas--that of the Crimea in 1854, and that of\r\nManchuria in 1904--and neither of these cases is in point, for in neither\r\nwas there any attempt at naval defence. Still there seems no reason to\r\nbelieve that such defence applied in the old manner would be less effective\r\nthan formerly. The flotilla was its basis, and since the introduction of\r\nthe torpedo the power of the flotilla has greatly increased. Its real and\r\nmoral effect against transports must certainly be greater than ever, and\r\nthe power of squadrons to break a flotilla blockade is more restricted.\r\nMines, again, tell almost entirely in favour of defence, so much so indeed\r\nas to render a rapid _coup de main_ against any important port almost an\r\nimpossibility. In the absence of all experience it is to such theoretical\r\nconsiderations we must turn for light.\r\n\r\nTheoretically stated, the success of our old system of defence depended on\r\nfour relations. Firstly, there is the relation between the rapidity with\r\nwhich an invasion force could be mobilised and embarked, and the rapidity\r\nwith which restlessness in foreign ports and _places d'armes_ could be\r\nreported; that is to say, the chance of surprise and evasion are as the\r\nspeed of preparation to the speed of intelligence.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is the relation of the speed of convoys to the speed of\r\ncruisers and flotilla; that is to say, our ability to get contact with a\r\nconvoy after it has put to sea and before the expedition can be disembarked\r\nis as the speed of our cruisers and flotilla to the speed of the convoy.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is the relation between the destructive power of modern\r\ncruisers and flotillas against a convoy unescorted or weakly escorted and\r\nthe corresponding power in sailing days.\r\n\r\nFourthly, there is the relation between the speed of convoys and the speed\r\nof battle-squadrons, which is of importance where the enemy's transports\r\nare likely to be strongly escorted. On this relation depends the facility\r\nwith which the battle-squadron covering our mobile defence can secure an\r\ninterior position from which it may strike either the enemy's\r\nbattle-squadron if it moves or his convoy before it can complete its\r\npassage and effect the landing.\r\n\r\nAll these relations appear to have been modified by modern developments in\r\nfavour of the defence. In the first ratio, that of speed of mobilisation to\r\nspeed of intelligence, it is obviously so. Although military mobilisation\r\nmay be still relatively as rapid as the mobilisation of fleets, yet\r\nintelligence has outstripped both. This is true both for gaining and for\r\nconveying intelligence. Preparations for oversea invasion were never easy\r\nto conceal, owing to the disturbance of the flow of shipping that they\r\ncaused. Elaborate precautions were taken to prevent commercial leakage of\r\nintelligence, but they never entirely succeeded. Yet formerly, in the\r\ncondition of comparative crudeness with which international trade was then\r\norganised, concealment was relatively easy, at least for a time. But the\r\never-growing sensitiveness of world-wide commerce, when market movements\r\nare reported from hour to hour instead of from week to week, has greatly\r\nincreased the difficulty. And apart from the rapidity with which\r\ninformation may be gathered through this alert and intimate sympathy\r\nbetween Exchanges, there is the still more important fact that with\r\nwireless the speed of conveying naval intelligence has increased in a far\r\nhigher ratio than the speed of sea transit.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ratio between cruiser and convoy speeds, on which evasion so\r\nmuch depends, it is the same. In frigate days the ratio appears to have\r\nbeen not more than seven to five. Now in the case at any rate of large\r\nconvoys it would be nearly double.\r\n\r\nOf the destructive power of the flotilla, growing as it does from year to\r\nyear, enough has been said already. With the advent of the torpedo and\r\nsubmarine it has probably increased tenfold. In a lesser degree the same is\r\ntrue of cruisers. In former days the physical power of a cruiser to injure\r\na dispersing convoy was comparatively low, owing to her relatively low\r\nexcess of speed and the restricted range and destructive power of her guns.\r\nWith higher speed and higher energy and range in gun power the ability of\r\ncruisers to cut up a convoy renders its practical annihilation almost\r\ncertain if once it be caught, and consequently affords a moral deterrent\r\nagainst trusting to evasion beyond anything that was known before.\r\n\r\nThe increased ratio of battle-fleet speed to that of large convoys is\r\nequally indisputable and no less important, for the facility of finding\r\ninterior positions which it implies goes to the root of the old system. So\r\nlong as our battle-fleet is in a position whence it can cover our flotilla\r\nblockade or strike the enemy's convoy in transit, it forces his\r\nbattle-fleet in the last resort to close up on the convoy, and that, as\r\nKempenfelt pointed out, is practically fatal to the success of invasion.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point of view, then, we regard the future chances of\r\nsuccessful invasion over an uncommanded sea, it would seem that not only\r\ndoes the old system hold good, but that all modern developments which touch\r\nthe question bid fair to intensify the results which our sea service at\r\nleast used so confidently to expect, and which it never failed to secure.\r\n\r\nII. ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF TRADE\r\n\r\nThe base idea of the attack and defence of trade may be summed up in the\r\nold adage, \"Where the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered\r\ntogether.\" The most fertile areas always attracted the strongest attack,\r\nand therefore required the strongest defence; and between the fertile and\r\nthe infertile areas it was possible to draw a line which for strategical\r\npurposes was definite and constant. The fertile areas were the terminals of\r\ndeparture and destination where trade tends to be crowded, and in a\r\nsecondary degree the focal points where, owing to the conformation of the\r\nland, trade tends to converge. The infertile areas were the great routes\r\nwhich passed through the focal points and connected the terminal areas.\r\nConsequently attack on commerce tends to take one of two forms. It may be\r\nterminal or it may be pelagic, terminal attack being the more profitable,\r\nbut demanding the greater force and risk, and pelagic attack being the more\r\nuncertain, but involving less force and risk.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead us directly to the paradox which underlies the\r\nunbroken failure of our enemies to exercise decisive pressure upon us by\r\noperations against our trade. It is that where attack is most to be feared,\r\nthere defence is easiest. A plan of war which has the destruction of trade\r\nfor its primary object implies in the party using it an inferiority at sea.\r\nHad he superiority, his object would be to convert that superiority to a\r\nworking command by battle or blockade. Except, therefore, in the rare cases\r\nwhere the opposed forces are equal, we must assume that the belligerent who\r\nmakes commerce destruction his primary object will have to deal with a\r\nsuperior fleet. Now, it is true that the difficulty of defending trade lies\r\nmainly in the extent of sea it covers. But, on the other hand, the areas in\r\nwhich it tends to congregate, and in which alone it is seriously\r\nvulnerable, are few and narrow, and can be easily occupied if we are in\r\nsuperior force. Beyond those areas effective occupation is impossible, but\r\nso also is effective attack. Hence the controlling fact of war on commerce,\r\nthat facility of attack means facility of defence.\r\n\r\nBeside this fundamental principle we must place another that is scarcely\r\nless important. Owing to the general common nature of sea communications,\r\nattack and defence of trade are so intimately connected that the one\r\noperation is almost indistinguishable from the other. Both ideas are\r\nsatisfied by occupying the common communications. The strongest form of\r\nattack is the occupation of the enemy's terminals, and the establishment of\r\na commercial blockade of the ports they contain. But as this operation\r\nusually requires the blockade of an adjacent naval port, it also\r\nconstitutes, as a rule, a defensive disposition for our own trade, even\r\nwhen the enemy's terminal area does not overlap one of our own. In the\r\noccupation of focal areas the two ideas are even more inseparable, since\r\nmost, if not all, such areas are on lines of communication that are common.\r\nIt will suffice, therefore, to deal with the general aspect of the subject\r\nfrom the point of view of defence.\r\n\r\nIt was in conformity with the distinction between fertile and infertile\r\nareas that our old system of trade defence was developed. Broadly speaking,\r\nthat system was to hold the terminals in strength, and in important cases\r\nthe focal points as well. By means of a battle-squadron with a full\r\ncomplement of cruisers they were constituted defended areas, or \"tracts\" as\r\nthe old term was, and the trade was regarded as safe when it entered them.\r\nThe intervening trade-routes were left as a rule undefended. Thus our home\r\nterminals were held by two battle-squadrons, the Western Squadron at the\r\nmouth of the Channel, and the North Sea or Eastern Squadron with its\r\nheadquarters usually in the Downs. To these was added a cruiser squadron on\r\nthe Irish station based at Cork, which was sometimes subordinate to the\r\nWestern Squadron and sometimes an independent organisation. The area of the\r\nWestern Squadron in the French wars extended, as we have seen, over the\r\nwhole Bay of Biscay, with the double function, so far as commerce was\r\nconcerned, of preventing the issue of raiding squadrons from the enemy's\r\nports, and acting offensively against his Atlantic trade. That of the North\r\nSea squadron extended to the mouth of the Baltic and the north-about\r\npassage. Its main function during the great naval coalitions against us was\r\nto check the operations of Dutch squadrons or to prevent the intrusion of\r\nFrench ones north-about against our Baltic trade. Like the Western\r\nSquadron, it threw out divisions usually located at Yarmouth and Leith for\r\nthe protection of our coastwise trade from privateers and sporadic cruisers\r\nacting from ports within the defended area. Similarly, between the Downs\r\nand the Western Squadron was usually one or more smaller squadrons, mainly\r\ncruisers, and generally located about Havre and the Channel Islands, which\r\nserved the same purpose for the Norman and North Breton ports. To complete\r\nthe system there were flotilla patrols acting under the port admirals and\r\ndoing their best to police the routes of the coastwise and local traffic,\r\nwhich then had an importance long since lost. The home system of course\r\ndiffered at different times, but it was always on these general lines. The\r\nnaval defence was supplemented by defended ports of refuge, the principal\r\nones being on the coast of Ireland to shelter the ocean trade, but others\r\nin great numbers were provided within the defended areas against the\r\noperations of privateers, and the ruins of batteries all round the British\r\nshores testify how complete was the organisation.\r\n\r\nA similar system prevailed in the colonial areas, but there the naval\r\ndefence consisted normally of cruiser squadrons stiffened with one or two\r\nships-of-the-line mainly for the purpose of carrying the flag. They were\r\nonly occupied by battle-squadrons when the enemy threatened operations with\r\na similar force. The minor or interior defence against local privateers was\r\nto a large extent local; that is, the great part of the flotilla was\r\nfurnished by sloops built or hired on the spot, as being best adapted for\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nFocal points were not then so numerous as they have become since the\r\ndevelopment of the Far Eastern trade. The most important of them, the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar, was treated as a defended area. From the point of\r\nview of commerce-protection it was held by the Mediterranean squadron. By\r\nkeeping watch on Toulon that squadron covered not only the Straits, but\r\nalso the focal points within the sea. It too had its extended divisions,\r\nsometimes as many as four, one about the approaches to Leghorn, one in the\r\nAdriatic, a third at Malta, and the fourth at Gibraltar. In cases of war\r\nwith Spain the latter was very strong, so as to secure the focal area\r\nagainst Cartagena and Cadiz. On one occasion indeed, in 1804-5, as we have\r\nseen, it was constituted for a short time an independent area with a\r\nspecial squadron. But in any case the Gibraltar area had its own internal\r\nflotilla guard under the direction of the port admiral as a defence against\r\nlocal privateers and pirates.\r\n\r\nThe general theory of these defended terminal and focal areas, it will be\r\nseen, was to hold in force those waters which converging trade made most\r\nfertile, and which therefore furnished an adequate field for the operations\r\nof raiding squadrons. In spite of the elaborate defensive system, such\r\nsquadrons might, and sometimes did, intrude by surprise or stealth, and\r\nwere then able to set at defiance both convoy escorts and the cruiser\r\noutposts. But, as experience proved, the system of terminal defence by\r\nbattle-squadrons made it impossible for such raiding squadrons to remain\r\nlong enough on the ground to cause any serious interruption or to do\r\nserious harm. It was only by a regular fleet of superior strength that the\r\nsystem could be broken down. In other words, the defence could only fall\r\nwhen our means of local control was destroyed by battle.\r\n\r\nSo much for the defended areas. With regard to the great routes that\r\nconnected them, it has been said they were left undefended. By this is\r\nmeant that the security of ships passing along them was provided for, not\r\nby patrols but by escort. The convoy system was adopted, and the theory of\r\nthat system is that while vessels are on the great routes they are normally\r\nliable only to sporadic attack, and they are consequently collected into\r\nfleets and furnished with an escort sufficient to repel sporadic attack. In\r\ntheory, cruiser escort is sufficient, but in practice it was found\r\nconvenient and economical to assign the duty in part to ships-of-the-line\r\nwhich were going out to join the distant terminal squadron or returning\r\nfrom it for a refit or some other reason; in other words, the system of\r\nforeign reliefs was made to work in with the supplementary escort system.\r\nWhere no such ships were available and the convoys were of great value, or\r\nenemy's ships-of-the-line were known to be out, similar units were\r\nspecially detailed for convoy duty to go and return, but this use of battle\r\nunits was exceptional.\r\n\r\nSuch a method of dealing with the great routes is the corollary of the idea\r\nof defended areas. As those areas were fertile and likely to attract\r\nraiding squadrons, so the great routes were infertile, and no enemy could\r\nafford to spend squadrons upon them. It is obvious, however, that the\r\nsystem had its weak side, for the mere fact that a convoy was upon a great\r\nroute tended to attract a squadron, and the comparative immunity of those\r\nroutes was lost. The danger was provided for to a great extent by the fact\r\nthat the enemy's ports from which a squadron could issue were all within\r\ndefended areas and watched by our own squadrons. Still, the guard could not\r\nbe made impenetrable. There was always the chance of a squadron escaping,\r\nand if it escaped towards a critical trade-route, it must be followed.\r\nHence there were times when the convoy system seriously disturbed our\r\ndispositions, as, for instance, in the crisis of the Trafalgar campaign,\r\nwhen for a short time our chain of defended areas was broken down by the\r\nescape of the Toulon squadron. That escape eventually forced a close\r\nconcentration on the Western Squadron, but all other considerations apart,\r\nit was felt to be impossible to retain the mass for more than two days\r\nowing to the fact that the great East and West Indies convoys were\r\napproaching, and Villeneuve's return to Ferrol from Martinique exposed them\r\nto squadronal attack. It was, in fact, impossible to tell whether the mass\r\nhad not been forced upon us with this special end in view.\r\n\r\nIn the liability to deflection of this kind lay the most serious\r\nstrategical objection to the convoy system. It was sought to minimise it by\r\ngiving the convoys a secret route when there was apprehension of squadronal\r\ninterference. It was done in the case just cited, but the precaution seemed\r\nin no way to lessen the anxiety. It may have been because in those days of\r\nslow communication there could be no such certainty that the secret route\r\nhad been received as there would be now.\r\n\r\nModern developments and changes in shipping and naval material have indeed\r\nso profoundly modified the whole conditions of commerce protection, that\r\nthere is no part of strategy where historical deduction is more difficult\r\nor more liable to error. To avoid such error as far as possible, it is\r\nessential to keep those developments in mind at every step. The more\r\nimportant of them are three in number. Firstly, the abolition of\r\nprivateering; secondly, the reduced range of action for all warships; and\r\nthirdly, the development of wireless telegraphy. There are others which\r\nmust be dealt with in their place, but these three go to the root of the\r\nwhole problem.\r\n\r\nDifficult as it is to arrive at exact statistics of commerce destruction in\r\nthe old wars, one thing seems certain--that the bulk of captures, which\r\nwere reckoned in hundreds and sometimes even in thousands, were due to the\r\naction of privateers. Further, it seems certain that, reckoning at least by\r\nnumbers, the greater part of the damage was done by small privateers\r\noperating close to their bases, either home or colonial, against coastwise\r\nand local traffic. The complaints of merchants, so far as they are known,\r\nrelate mainly to this kind of work in the West Indies and home waters,\r\nwhile accounts of serious captures by large privateers on the high seas are\r\ncomparatively rare. The actual damage done by the swarm of small vessels\r\nmay not have been great, but its moral effects were very serious. It was\r\nimpossible for the strongest Governments to ignore them, and the\r\nconsequence was a chronic disturbance of the larger strategical\r\ndispositions. While these dispositions were adequate to check the\r\noperations of large privateers acting in the same way as regular cruisers,\r\nthe smaller ones found very free play amidst the ribwork of the protective\r\nsystem, and they could only be dealt with by filling up the spaces with a\r\nswarm of small cruisers to the serious detriment of the larger\r\narrangements. Even so, the proximity of the enemy's ports made escape so\r\neasy, that the work of repression was very ineffective. The state of the\r\ncase was indeed almost identical with a people's war. The ordinary devices\r\nof strategy failed to deal with it, as completely as Napoleon's broadly\r\nplanned methods failed to deal with the _guerilleros_ in Spain, or as our\r\nown failed for so long in South Africa.\r\n\r\nBy the abolition of privateering, then, it would seem that the most\r\ndisturbing part of the problem has been eliminated. It is, of course,\r\nuncertain how far the Declaration of Paris will hold good in practice. It\r\nis still open even to the parties to it to evade its restrictions to a\r\ngreater or less extent by taking up and commissioning merchantmen as\r\nregular ships of war. But it is unlikely that such methods will extend\r\nbeyond the larger privately owned vessels. Any attempt to revive in this\r\nway the old _picaresque_ methods could only amount to a virtual repudiation\r\nof statutory international law, which would bring its own retribution.\r\nMoreover, for home waters at least, the conditions which favoured this\r\n_picaresque_ warfare no longer exist. In the old wars the bulk of our trade\r\ncame into the Thames, and thence the greater part of it was distributed in\r\nsmall coasting vessels. It was against this coastwise traffic that the\r\nsmall, short-range privateers found their opportunity and their richest\r\nharvest. But, now that so many other great centres of distribution have\r\nestablished themselves, and that the bulk of the distribution is done by\r\ninternal lines of communication, the Channel is no longer the sole artery,\r\nand the old troublesome disturbance can be avoided without a vital\r\ndislocation of our commercial system.\r\n\r\nThe probability, then, is that in the future the whole problem will be\r\nfound to be simplified, and that the work of commerce protection will lie\r\nmuch more within the scope of large strategical treatment than it ever did\r\nbefore, with the result that the change should be found to tell\r\nsubstantially in favour of defence and against attack.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of range of action is scarcely less important. In the old\r\ndays a cruising ship could be stored for six months, and so long as she\r\ncould occasionally renew her fuel and water, she was free to range the sea\r\noutside the defended areas for the whole of the period with unimpaired\r\nvitality. For such pelagic operations her movement was practically\r\nunrestricted. She could run for two or three days from a superior enemy or\r\nchase for as long without loss of energy, and she could wait indefinitely\r\nat a likely spot, or change her ground, as danger or hope of plunder\r\ndictated. So long as she had men left to man her prizes, her power of\r\nmischief was almost unlimited. All this is now changed. The capacity of\r\neach cruise of a ship to-day is very small. She is confined to short dashes\r\nwithin a strategically defended area, or if she is bent on pelagic\r\noperations, is compelled to proceed so far to find undefended waters that\r\nher coal will scarcely permit of more than a few days' actual cruising. A\r\ncouple of chases at high speed during that period may force her to return\r\nat once, subject only to the precarious possibility of renewing her coal\r\nfrom a prize. She has, further, to face the fact that manning prizes must\r\nnecessarily reduce her capacity for speed, which depends so much on a fully\r\nmanned engine-room. This will tend to jeopardise her chances of return\r\nthrough or near defended areas. The only escape from this difficulty is to\r\nsink the captured ship. But this course has objections scarcely less\r\nweighty than the other. No Power will incur the odium of sinking a prize\r\nwith all hands, and their removal to the captor's ship takes time,\r\nespecially in bad weather, and the presence of such prisoners in a cruiser\r\nin any number soon becomes a serious check on her fighting power. In the\r\ncase of large ships, moreover, the work of destruction is no easy matter.\r\nIn the most favourable circumstances it takes a considerable time, and thus\r\nnot only eats into the cruiser's endurance, but decreases her chances of\r\nevasion.\r\n\r\nFrom these and similar considerations it is obvious that the possibilities\r\nof operations on the great trade-routes are much less extensive than they\r\nwere formerly, while to speak of cruisers \"infesting\" those routes is sheer\r\nhyperbole. Under modern conditions it is scarcely more feasible than it\r\nwould be to keep up a permanent blockade of the British Islands. It would\r\nrequire a flow of ships in such numbers as no country but our own can\r\ncontemplate possessing, and such as could not be maintained without having\r\nfirst secured a very decided preponderance at sea. The loss of radius of\r\naction therefore, though it does not increase the power of defence,\r\nsensibly lessens that of attack by pelagic operations.\r\n\r\nFor the great increase in the powers of defence we must turn to the\r\nextraordinary development in the means of distant communication. Under\r\nformer conditions it was possible for a cruising ship to remain for days\r\nupon a fertile spot and make a number of captures before her presence was\r\nknown. But since most large merchantmen have been fitted with wireless\r\ninstallations, she cannot now attack a single one of them without fear of\r\ncalling down upon her an adversary. Moreover, when she is once located,\r\nevery ship within wireless reach can be warned of her presence and avoid\r\nher. She must widely and constantly shift her position, thereby still\r\nfurther reducing her staying power. On the whole, then, it would appear\r\nthat in so far as modern developments affect the problem, they certainly\r\nrender pelagic operations far more difficult and uncertain than they used\r\nto be. Upon the great routes the power of attack has been reduced and the\r\nmeans of evasion has increased to such an extent as to demand entire\r\nreconsideration of the defence of trade between terminal areas. The whole\r\nbasis of the old system would seem to be involved. That basis was the\r\nconvoy system, and it now becomes doubtful whether the additional security\r\nwhich convoys afforded is sufficient to outweigh their economical drawbacks\r\nand their liability to cause strategical disturbance.\r\n\r\nOver and above the considerations already noticed, there are three others,\r\nall of which favour the security of our trade by permitting a much more\r\nextended choice of route. The first is, that steam vessels are not forced\r\nby prevailing winds to keep to particular courses. The second is, that the\r\nimprovements in the art of navigation no longer render it so necessary to\r\nmake well-known landfalls during transit. The third is, that the\r\nmultiplication of our great ports of distribution have divided the old main\r\nflow of trade to the Channel into a number of minor streams that cover a\r\nmuch wider area and demand a greater distribution of force for effective\r\nattack. It will be obvious that the combined effect of these considerations\r\nis to increase still further the chances of individual vessels evading the\r\nenemy's cruisers and to lessen the risk of dispensing with escort.\r\n\r\nNor are the new practical difficulties of sporadic operations on the great\r\nroutes the only arguments that minimise the value of convoys. We have also\r\nto remember that while the number of vessels trading across the ocean has\r\nenormously increased since 1815, it is scarcely possible, even if the\r\nabolition of privateering prove abortive, that the number of cruisers\r\navailable for pelagic attack could exceed, or even equal, the number\r\nemployed in sailing days. This consideration, then, must also be thrown\r\ninto the scale against convoys; for it is certain that the amount of\r\nserious operative damage which an enemy can do to our trade by pelagic\r\noperation is mainly determined by the ratio which his available cruiser\r\nstrength bears to the volume of that trade. This aspect of the question is,\r\nhowever, part of a much wider one, which concerns the relation which the\r\nvolume of our trade bears to the difficulty of its defence, and this must\r\nbe considered later.\r\n\r\nIt remains, first, to deal with the final link in the old system of\r\ndefence. The statement that the great routes were left undefended will seem\r\nto be in opposition to a prevailing impression derived from the fact that\r\nfrigates are constantly mentioned as being \"on a cruise.\" The assumption is\r\nthat they in effect patrolled the great routes. But this was not so, nor\r\ndid they rove the sea at will. They constituted a definite and necessary\r\npart of the system. Though that system was founded on a distinction between\r\ndefended terminals and undefended routes, which was a real strategical\r\ndistinction, it was impossible to draw an actual line where the one sphere\r\nbegan and the other ended. Outside the regularly defended areas lay a\r\nregion which, as the routes began to converge, was comparatively fertile.\r\nIn this region enemies' cruisers and their larger privateers found the mean\r\nbetween risk and profit. Here too convoys, as they entered the zone, were\r\nin their greatest danger for fear of their escorts being overpowered by\r\nraiding squadrons. Consequently it was the practice, when the approach of\r\nconvoys was expected, to throw forward from the defended area groups of\r\npowerful cruisers, and even battleship divisions, to meet them and\r\nreinforce their escorts. Outward-bound convoys had their escorts similarly\r\nstrengthened till they were clear of the danger zone. The system was in\r\nregular use both for home and colonial areas. In no sense did it constitute\r\na patrol of the routes. It was in practice and conception a system of\r\noutposts, which at seasons of special risk amounted to an extension of the\r\ndefended areas combining with a reinforcement of the convoy escorts. Focal\r\npoints of lesser importance, such as Capes Finisterre and St. Vincent, were\r\nsimilarly held by one or two powerful cruisers, and if necessary by a\r\nsquadron.\r\n\r\nAs has been already explained, owing to the peculiar conditions of the sea\r\nand the common nature of maritime communications, these dispositions were\r\nadopted as well for attack as defence, and the fertile areas, for the\r\ndefence of which a frigate captain was sent \"on a cruise,\" were always\r\nliable to bring him rich reward. His mission of defence carried with it the\r\nbest opportunities for attack.\r\n\r\nIn the full development of the system patrol lines did exist, but not for\r\nthe great routes. They were established to link up adjacent defended areas\r\nand as a more scientific organisation of the cruiser outposts. In 1805 the\r\nGibraltar and the home areas were thus connected by a patrol line which\r\nstretched from Cape St. Vincent through the Finisterre focal area to Cape\r\nClear, with a branch extending to the strategical centre off Ushant. The\r\nnew system was introduced at a time when we had reason to expect that the\r\nFrench and Spanish fleets were to be devoted entirely to operations in\r\nsmall raiding squadrons against our trade and colonies. Special provision\r\nwas therefore necessary to locate any such squadrons that might elude the\r\nregular blockades, and to ensure that they should be adequately pursued.\r\nThe new lines were in fact intelligence patrols primarily, though they were\r\nalso regarded as the only means of protecting efficiently the southern\r\ntrade-route where it was flanked by French and Spanish ports.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] It should be said that Cornwallis did not regard this system as new\r\n  except for the extension from Finisterre to St. Vincent, which Nelson\r\n  advised. In acknowledging the order from Ushant he wrote, \"The\r\n  instructions ... are nearly the same as have generally been given. I can\r\n  therefore only guess why a copy of the order was sent to\r\n  me.\"--_Admiralty, In-Letters_, 129, 28 September 1805.\r\n\r\nThe whole system, it will be observed, though not conflicting with the main\r\nobject of bringing the enemy's fleets to action, did entail an expenditure\r\nof force and deflecting preoccupations such as are unknown in land warfare.\r\nLarge numbers of cruisers had to be employed otherwise than as the eyes of\r\nthe battle-squadrons, while the coming and going of convoys produced\r\nperiodical oscillations in the general distribution.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassing as was this commercial deflection in the old wars, an\r\nimpression appears to prevail that in the future it must be much more\r\nserious. It is argued plausibly enough not only that our trade is far\r\nlarger and richer than it was, but also that, owing to certain well-known\r\neconomic changes, it is far more a matter of life and death to the nation\r\nthan in the days when food and raw material did not constitute the bulk of\r\nour imports. In view of the new conditions it is held that we are more\r\nvulnerable through our trade now than formerly, and that, consequently, we\r\nmust devote relatively more attention and force to its defence.\r\n\r\nIf this were true, it is obvious that war with a strong naval combination\r\nwould present difficulties of the most formidable kind, greater indeed than\r\nwe have ever experienced; for since with modern developments the demand for\r\nfleet cruisers is much greater than formerly, the power of devoting\r\ncruisers to trade defence is relatively much less.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that at first sight the conclusion looks\r\nirreproachable. But on analysis it will be found to involve two\r\nassumptions, both of which are highly questionable. The first is, that the\r\nvulnerability of a sea Power through its maritime trade is as the volume of\r\nthat trade. The second is, that the difficulty of defending sea-borne trade\r\nis also as its volume--that is to say, the larger the amount of the trade,\r\nthe larger must be the force devoted to its protection. This idea indeed is\r\ncarried so far, that we are frequently invited to fix the standard of our\r\nnaval strength by comparing it with the proportion which the naval strength\r\nof other Powers bears to their sea-borne trade.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the foregoing sketch of our traditional system of trade\r\ndefence will avail to raise a doubt whether either assumption can be\r\naccepted without very careful consideration. In the history of that system\r\nthere is no indication that it was affected by the volume of the trade it\r\nwas designed to protect. Nor has any one succeeded in showing that the\r\npressure which an enemy could exert upon us through our commerce increased\r\nin effect with the volume of our seaborne trade. The broad indications\r\nindeed are the other way--that the greater the volume of our trade, the\r\nless was the effective impression which an enemy could make upon it, even\r\nwhen he devoted his whole naval energies to that end. It is not too much to\r\nsay that in every case where he took this course his own trade dwindled to\r\nnothing, while ours continually increased.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this was because the only periods in which he\r\ndevoted his main efforts to trade destruction were when we had dominated\r\nhis navy, and being no longer able to dispute the command, he could do no\r\nmore than interfere with its exercise. But this must always be so whether\r\nwe have positively dominated his navy or not. If he tries to ignore our\r\nbattle-fleets, and devotes himself to operations against trade, he cannot\r\ndispute the command. Whatever his strength, he must leave the command to\r\nus. He cannot do both systematically, and unless he attacks our trade\r\nsystematically by sustained strategical operation, he cannot hope to make\r\nany real impression.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we take the two assumptions and test them by the application of\r\nelementary principles, both will appear theoretically unsound. Let us take\r\nfirst the relation of vulnerability to volume. Since the object of war is\r\nto force our will upon the enemy, the only way in which we can expect war\r\non commerce to serve our end is to inflict so much damage upon it as will\r\ncause our enemy to prefer peace on our terms to a continuation of the\r\nstruggle. The pressure on his trade must be insupportable, not merely\r\nannoying. It must seriously cripple his finance or seriously threaten to\r\nstrangle his national life and activities. If his total trade be a hundred\r\nmillions, and we succeed in destroying five, he will feel it no more than\r\nhe does the ordinary fluctuations to which he is accustomed in time of\r\npeace. If, however, we can destroy fifty millions, his trade equilibrium\r\nwill be overthrown, and the issue of the war will be powerfully affected.\r\nIn other words, to affect the issue the impression made on trade must be a\r\npercentage or relative impression. The measure of a nation's vulnerability\r\nthrough its trade is the percentage of destruction that an enemy can\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nNow, it is true that the amount of damage which a belligerent can inflict\r\nwith a given force on an enemy's commerce will vary to some extent with its\r\nvolume; for the greater the volume of commerce, the more fertile will be\r\nthe undefended cruising grounds. But no matter how fertile such areas might\r\nbe, the destructive power of a cruiser was always limited, and it must be\r\nstill more limited in the future. It was limited by the fact that it was\r\nphysically impossible to deal with more than a certain number of prizes in\r\na certain time, and, for the reasons already indicated, this limit has\r\nsuffered a very marked restriction. When this limit of capacity in a given\r\nforce is passed, the volume of commerce will not affect the issue; and\r\nseeing how low that capacity must be in the future and how enormous is the\r\nvolume of our trade, the limit of destructive power, at least as against\r\nourselves, provided we have a reasonably well-organised system of defence,\r\nmust be relatively low. It must, in fact, be passed at a percentage figure\r\nwell within what we have easily supported in the past. There is reason,\r\ntherefore, to believe that so far from the assumption in question being\r\ntrue, the effective vulnerability of sea-borne trade is not in direct but\r\nin inverse proportion to its volume. In other words, the greater the\r\nvolume, the more difficult it is to make an effective percentage\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it will be observed that the strain of trade defence was\r\nproportioned not to the volume of that trade, but to the number and\r\nexposure of its terminals and focal points. Whatever the volume of the\r\ntrade these remained the same in number, and the amount of force required\r\nfor their defence varied only with the strength that could readily be\r\nbrought to bear against them. It varied, that is, with the distribution of\r\nthe enemy's bases and the amount of his naval force. Thus in the war of\r\n1812 with the United States, the West Indian and North American areas were\r\nmuch more exposed than they had been when we were at war with France alone\r\nand when American ports were not open to her as bases. They became\r\nvulnerable not only to the United States fleet, but also in a much higher\r\ndegree to that of France, and consequently the force we found necessary to\r\ndevote to trade defence in the North Atlantic was out of all proportion to\r\nthe naval strength of the new belligerent. Our protective force had to be\r\nincreased enormously, while the volume of our trade remained precisely the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThis relation of trade defence to terminal and focal areas is of great\r\nimportance, for it is in the increase of such areas in the Far East that\r\nlies the only radical change in the problem. The East Indian seas were\r\nalways of course to some extent treated as a defended area, but the problem\r\nwas simplified by the partial survival in those regions of the old method\r\nof defence. Till about the end of the seventeenth century long-range trade\r\nwas expected to defend itself, at least outside the home area, and the\r\nretention of their armament by East Indiamen was the last survival of the\r\npractice. Beyond the important focal area of St. Helena they relied mainly\r\non their own power of resistance or to such escort as could be provided by\r\nthe relief ships of the East Indian station. As a rule, their escort proper\r\nwent no farther outward-bound than St. Helena, whence it returned with the\r\nhomeward-bound vessels that gathered there from India, China, and the South\r\nSea whaling grounds. The idea of the system was to provide escort for that\r\npart of the great route which was exposed to attack from French or Spanish\r\ncolonial bases on the African coasts and in the adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons this system would have to be reconsidered in the\r\nfuture. The expansion of the great European Powers have changed the\r\nconditions for which it sufficed, and in a war with any one of them the\r\nsystem of defended terminal and focal areas would require a great extension\r\neastward, absorbing an appreciable section of our force, and entailing a\r\ncomparatively weak prolongation of our chain of concentrations. Here, then,\r\nwe must mark a point where trade defence has increased in difficulty, and\r\nthere is one other.\r\n\r\nAlthough minor hostile bases within a defended area have lost most of their\r\nmenace to trade, they have acquired as torpedo bases a power of disturbing\r\nthe defence itself. So long as such bases exist with a potent flotilla\r\nwithin them, it is obvious that the actual provision for defence cannot be\r\nso simple a matter as it was formerly. Other and more complex arrangements\r\nmay have to be made. Still, the principle of defended areas seems to remain\r\nunshaken, and if it is to work with its old effectiveness, the means and\r\nthe disposition for securing those areas will have to be adapted to the new\r\ntactical possibilities. The old strategical conditions, so far as can be\r\nseen, are unaltered except in so far as the reactions of modern material\r\nmake them tell in favour of defence rather than of attack.\r\n\r\nIf we desire to formulate the principles on which this conclusion rests we\r\nshall find them in the two broad rules, firstly, that the vulnerability of\r\ntrade is in inverse ratio to its volume, and secondly, that facility of\r\nattack means facility of defence. The latter, which was always true,\r\nreceives special emphasis from modern developments. Facility of attack\r\nmeans the power of exercising control. For exercise of control we require\r\nnot only numbers, but also speed and endurance, qualities which can only be\r\nobtained in two ways: it must be at the cost of armour and armament, or at\r\nthe cost of increased size. By increasing size we at once lose numbers. If\r\nby sacrificing armament and armour we seek to maintain numbers and so\r\nfacilitate attack, we at the same time facilitate defence. Vessels of low\r\nfighting power indeed cannot hope to operate in fertile areas without\r\nsupport to overpower the defence. Every powerful unit detached for such\r\nsupport sets free a unit on the other side, and when this process is once\r\nbegun, there is no halting-place. Supporting units to be effective must\r\nmultiply into squadrons, and sooner or later the inferior Power seeking to\r\nsubstitute commerce destruction for the clash of squadrons will have\r\nsquadronal warfare thrust upon him, provided again the superior Power\r\nadopts a reasonably sound system of defence. It was always so, and, so far\r\nas it is possible to penetrate the mists which veil the future, it would\r\nseem that with higher mobility and better means of communication the\r\nsquadronal stage must be reached long before any adequate percentage\r\nimpression can have been made by the sporadic action of commerce\r\ndestroyers. Ineffectual as such warfare has always been in the past, until\r\na general command has been established, its prospects in the future, judged\r\nby the old established principles, are less promising than ever.\r\n\r\nFinally, in approaching the problem of trade protection, and especially for\r\nthe actual determination of the force and distribution it requires, there\r\nis a dominant limitation to be kept in mind. By no conceivable means is it\r\npossible to give trade absolute protection. We cannot make an omelette\r\nwithout breaking eggs. We cannot make war without losing ships. To aim at a\r\nstandard of naval strength or a strategical distribution which would make\r\nour trade absolutely invulnerable is to march to economic ruin. It is to\r\ncripple our power of sustaining war to a successful issue, and to seek a\r\nposition of maritime despotism which, even if it were attainable, would set\r\nevery man's hand against us. All these evils would be upon us, and our goal\r\nwould still be in the far distance. In 1870 the second naval Power in the\r\nworld was at war with an enemy that could not be considered a naval Power\r\nat all, and yet she lost ships by capture. Never in the days of our most\r\ncomplete domination upon the seas was our trade invulnerable, and it never\r\ncan be. To seek invulnerability is to fall into the strategical vice of\r\ntrying to be superior everywhere, to forfeit the attainment of the\r\nessential for fear of risking the unessential, to base our plans on an\r\nassumption that war may be waged without loss, that it is, in short,\r\nsomething that it never has been and never can be. Such peace-bred dreams\r\nmust be rigorously abjured. Our standard must be the mean of economic\r\nstrength--the line which on the one hand will permit us to nourish our\r\nfinancial resources for the evil day, and on the other, when that day\r\ncomes, will deny to the enemy the possibility of choking our financial\r\nvigour by sufficiently checking the flow of our trade.\r\n\r\nIII. ATTACK, DEFENCE, AND SUPPORT OF\r\nMILITARY EXPEDITIONS\r\n\r\nThe attack and defence of oversea expeditions are governed in a large\r\nmeasure by the principles of attack and defence of trade. In both cases it\r\nis a question of control of communications, and in a general way it may be\r\nsaid, if we control them for the one purpose, we control them for the\r\nother. But with combined expeditions freedom of passage is not the only\r\nconsideration. The duties of the fleet do not end with the protection of\r\nthe troops during transit, as in the case of convoys, unless indeed, as\r\nwith convoys, the destination is a friendly country. In the normal case of\r\na hostile destination, where resistance is to be expected from the\r\ncommencement of the operations, the fleet is charged with further duties of\r\na most exacting kind. They may be described generally as duties of support,\r\nand it is the intrusion of these duties which distinguish the naval\r\narrangements for combined operations most sharply from those for the\r\nprotection of trade. Except for this consideration there need be no\r\ndifference in the method of defence. In each case the strength required\r\nwould be measured by the dangers of interference in transit. But as it is,\r\nthat standard will not serve for combined expeditions; for however small\r\nthose risks, the protective arrangements must be sufficiently extensive to\r\ninclude arrangements for support.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with this, the most complex aspect of the question, it will\r\nbe well to dismiss attack. From the strategical point of view its\r\nprinciples differ not at all from those already laid down for active\r\nresistance of invasion. Whether the expedition that threatens us be small\r\nor of invasion strength, the cardinal rule has always been that the\r\ntransports and not the escort must be the primary objective of the fleet.\r\nThe escort, according to the old practice, must be turned or contained, but\r\nnever treated as a primary objective unless both turning and containing\r\nprove to be impracticable. It is needless to repeat the words of the old\r\nmasters in which this principle lies embalmed. It is seldom that we find a\r\nrule of naval strategy laid down in precise technical terms, but this one\r\nis an exception. In the old squadronal instructions, \"The transports of the\r\nenemy are to be your principal object,\" became something like a common\r\nform.\r\n\r\nNor did this rule apply only to cases where the transports were protected\r\nby a mere escort. It held good even in the exceptional cases where the\r\nmilitary force was accompanied or guarded by the whole available battle\r\nstrength of the enemy. We have seen how in 1744 Norris was prepared to\r\nfollow the French transports if necessary with his whole force, and how in\r\n1798 Nelson organised his fleet in such a way as to contain rather than\r\ndestroy the enemy's battle-squadron, so that he might provide for an\r\noverwhelming attack upon the transports.\r\n\r\nExceptions to this as to all strategical rules may be conceived. Conditions\r\nmight exist in which, if the enemy's battle-fleet accompanied his\r\ntransports, it would be worth our while, for ulterior objects of our own,\r\nto risk the escape of the transports in order to seize the opportunity of\r\ndestroying the fleet. But even in such a case the distinction would be\r\nlittle more than academical; for our best chance of securing a decisive\r\ntactical advantage against the enemy's fleet would usually be to compel it\r\nto conform to our movements by threatening an attack on the transports. It\r\nis well known that it is in the embarrassment arising from the presence of\r\ntransports that lies the special weakness of a fleet in charge of them.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one condition which radically differentiates\r\ncomparatively small expeditions from great invasions and that is the power\r\nof evasion. Our experience has proved beyond dispute that the navy alone\r\ncannot guarantee defence against such expeditions. It cannot be sure of\r\npreventing their sailing or of attacking them in transit, and this is\r\nespecially the case where an open sea gives them a free choice of route, as\r\nin the case of the French expeditions against Ireland. It is for this\r\nreason that, although an adequate navy has always proved sufficient to\r\nprevent an invasion, for defence against expeditions it must be\r\nsupplemented by a home army. To perfect our defence, or, in other words,\r\nour power of attack, such an army must be adequate to ensure that all\r\nexpeditions small enough to evade the fleet shall do no effective harm when\r\nthey land. If in numbers, training, organisation, and distribution it is\r\nadequate for this purpose, an enemy cannot hope to affect the issue of the\r\nwar except by raising his expeditions to invasion strength, and so finding\r\nhimself involved in a problem that no one has ever yet solved for an\r\nuncommanded sea.\r\n\r\nStill, even for expeditions below invasion strength the navy will only\r\nregard the army as a second line, and its strategy must provide in the\r\nevent of evasion for co-operation with that line. By means of a just\r\ndistribution of its coastal flotilla it will provide for getting contact\r\nwith the expedition at the earliest moment after its destination is\r\ndeclared. It will press the principle of making the army its objective to\r\nthe utmost limit by the most powerful and energetic cruiser pursuit, and\r\nwith wireless and the increased ratio of cruiser speed, such pursuit is far\r\nmore formidable than it ever was. No expedition nowadays, however\r\nsuccessful its evasion, can be guaranteed against naval interruption in the\r\nprocess of landing. Still less can it be guaranteed against naval\r\ninterference in its rear or flanks while it is securing its front against\r\nthe home army. It may seek by using large transports to reduce their number\r\nand secure higher speed, but while that will raise its chance of evasion,\r\nit will prolong the critical period of landing. If it seek by using smaller\r\ntransports to quicken disembarkation, that will decrease its chances of\r\nevasion by lowering its speed and widening the sea area it will occupy in\r\ntransit. All the modern developments in fact which make for defence in case\r\nof invasion over an uncommanded sea also go to facilitate timely contact\r\nwith an expedition seeking to operate by evasion. Nor must it be forgotten,\r\nsince the problem is a combined one, that the corresponding developments\r\nashore tell with little less force in favour of the defending army. Such\r\nappear to be the broad principles which govern an enemy's attempts to act\r\nwith combined expeditions in our own waters, where by hypothesis we are in\r\nsufficient naval strength to deny him permanent local command. We may now\r\nturn to the larger and more complex question of the conduct of such\r\nexpeditions where the naval conditions are reversed.\r\n\r\nBy the conduct, be it remembered, we mean not only their defence but also\r\ntheir support, and for this reason the starting-point of our inquiry is to\r\nbe found, as above indicated, in the contrast of combined expeditions with\r\nconvoys. A convoy consists of two elements--a fleet of merchantmen and an\r\nescort. But a combined expedition does not consist simply of an army and a\r\nsquadron. It is an organism at once more complex and more homogeneous. Its\r\nconstitution is fourfold. There is, firstly, the army; secondly, the\r\ntransports and landing flotilla--that is, the flotilla of flat-boats and\r\nsteamboats for towing them, all of which may be carried in the transports\r\nor accompany them; thirdly, the \"Squadron in charge of transports,\" as it\r\ncame to be called, which includes the escort proper and the supporting\r\nflotilla of lighter craft for inshore work; and lastly, the \"Covering\r\nsquadron.\"\r\n\r\nSuch at least is a combined expedition in logical analysis. But so\r\nessentially is it a single organism, that in practice these various\r\nelements can seldom be kept sharply distinct. They may be interwoven in the\r\nmost intricate manner. Indeed to a greater or less extent each will always\r\nhave to discharge some of the functions of the others. Thus the covering\r\nsquadron may not only be indistinguishable from the escort and support, but\r\nit will often provide the greater part of the landing flotilla and even a\r\nportion of the landing force. Similarly, the escort may also serve as\r\ntransport, and provide in part not only the supporting force, but also the\r\nlanding flotilla. The fourfold constitution is therefore in a great measure\r\ntheoretical. Still its use is not merely that it serves to define the\r\nvaried functions which the fleet will have to discharge. As we proceed it\r\nwill be seen to have a practical strategical value.\r\n\r\nFrom a naval point of view it is the covering squadron which calls first\r\nfor consideration, because of the emphasis with which its necessity marks\r\nnot only the distinction between the conduct of combined expeditions and\r\nthe conduct of commercial convoys, but also the fact that such expeditions\r\nare actually a combined force, and not merely an army escorted by a fleet.\r\n\r\nIn our system of commerce protection the covering squadron had no place.\r\nThe battle-fleet, as we have seen, was employed in holding definite\r\nterminal areas, and had no organic connection with the convoys. The convoys\r\nhad no further protection than their own escort and the reinforcements that\r\nmet them as they approached the terminal areas. But where a convoy of\r\ntransports forming part of a combined expedition was destined for an\r\nenemy's country and would have to overcome resistance by true combined\r\noperations, a covering battle-squadron was always provided. In the case of\r\ndistant objectives it might be that the covering squadron was not attached\r\ntill the whole expedition assembled in the theatre of operations; during\r\ntransit to that theatre the transports might have commerce protection\r\nescort only. But once the operations began from the point of concentration,\r\na covering squadron was always in touch.\r\n\r\nIt was only where the destination of the troops was a friendly country, and\r\nthe line of passage was well protected by our permanent blockades, that a\r\ncovering squadron could be dispensed with altogether. Thus our various\r\nexpeditions for the assistance of Portugal were treated exactly like\r\ncommercial convoys, but in such cases as Wolfe's expedition to Quebec or\r\nAmherst's to Louisburg, or indeed any of those which were continually\r\nlaunched against the West Indies, a battle-squadron was always provided as\r\nan integral part in the theatre of operations. Our arrangements in the\r\nCrimean War illustrate the point exactly. Our troops were sent out at first\r\nto land at Gallipoli in a friendly territory, and to act within that\r\nterritory as an army of observation. It was not a true combined expedition,\r\nand the transports were given no covering squadron. Their passage was\r\nsufficiently covered by our Channel and Mediterranean fleets occupying the\r\nexits of the Baltic and the Black Sea. But so soon as the original war plan\r\nproved ineffective and combined offensive operations against Sebastopol\r\nwere decided on, the Mediterranean fleet lost its independent character,\r\nand thenceforth its paramount function was to furnish a covering squadron\r\nin touch with the troops.\r\n\r\nSeeing how important are the support duties of such a force, the term\r\n\"Covering squadron\" may seem ill-chosen to describe it. But it is adopted\r\nfor two reasons. In the first place, it was the one employed officially in\r\nour service on the last mentioned occasion which was our last great\r\ncombined expedition. In preparing the descent on the Crimea, Sir Edmund\r\nLyons, who was acting as Chief of the Staff to Sir James Dundas, and had\r\ncharge of the combined operations, organised the fleet into a \"Covering\r\nsquadron\" and a \"Squadron in charge of transports.\" In the second place,\r\nthe designation serves to emphasise what is its main and primary function.\r\nFor important as it is to keep in mind its support duties, they must not be\r\npermitted to overshadow the fact that its paramount function is to prevent\r\ninterference with the actual combined operations--that is, the landing,\r\nsupport, and supply of the army. Thus in 1705, when Shovel and Peterborough\r\nwere operating against Barcelona, Shovel was covering the amphibious siege\r\nfrom the French squadron in Toulon. Peterborough required the assistance of\r\nthe marines ashore to execute a _coup de main_, and Shovel only consented\r\nto land them on the express understanding that the moment his cruisers\r\npassed the signal that the Toulon squadron was putting to sea, they would\r\nhave to be recalled to the fleet no matter what the state of the land\r\noperations. And to this Peterborough agreed. The principle involved, it\r\nwill be seen, is precisely that which Lyons's term \"Covering squadron\"\r\nembodies.\r\n\r\nTo quote anything that happened in the Crimean War as a precedent without\r\nsuch traditional support will scarcely appear convincing. In our British\r\nway we have fostered a legend that so far as organisation and staff work\r\nwere concerned that war was nothing but a collection of deterrent examples.\r\nBut in truth as a combined operation its opening movement both in\r\nconception and organisation was perhaps the most daring, brilliant, and\r\nsuccessful thing of the kind we ever did. Designed as the expedition was to\r\nassist an ally in his own country, it was suddenly called upon without any\r\nprevious preparation to undertake a combined operation of the most\r\ndifficult kind against the territory of a well-warned enemy. It involved a\r\nlanding late in the year on an open and stormy coast within striking\r\ndistance of a naval fortress which contained an army of unknown strength,\r\nand a fleet not much inferior in battle power and undefeated. It was an\r\noperation comparable to the capture of Louisburg and the landing of the\r\nJapanese in the Liaotung Peninsula, but the conditions were far more\r\ndifficult. Both those operations had been rehearsed a few years previously,\r\nand they had been long prepared on the fullest knowledge. In the Crimea\r\neverything was in the dark; even steam was an unproved element, and\r\neverything had to be improvised. The French had practically to demobilise\r\ntheir fleet to supply transport, and so hazardous did the enterprise\r\nappear, that they resisted its being undertaken with every military\r\nargument. We had in fact, besides all the other difficulties, to carry an\r\nunwilling ally upon our backs. Yet it was accomplished, and so far at least\r\nas the naval part was concerned, the methods which achieved success mark\r\nthe culmination of all we had learnt in three centuries of rich experience.\r\n\r\nThe first of the lessons was that for operations in uncommanded or\r\nimperfectly commanded seas there was need of a covering squadron\r\ndifferentiated from the squadron in charge of transports. Its main function\r\nwas to secure the necessary local command, whether for transit or for the\r\nactual operations. But as a rule transit was secured by our regular\r\nblockading squadrons, and generally the covering squadron only assembled in\r\nthe theatre of operations. When therefore the theatre was within a defended\r\nterminal area, as in our descents upon the northern and Atlantic coasts of\r\nFrance, then the terminal defence squadron was usually also sufficient to\r\nprotect the actual operations. It thus formed automatically the covering\r\nsquadron, and either continued its blockade, or, as in the case of our\r\nattack on St. Malo in 1758, took up a position between the enemy's squadron\r\nand the expedition's line of operation. If, however, the theatre of\r\noperation was not within a terminal area, or lay within a distant one that\r\nwas weakly held, the expedition was given its own covering squadron, in\r\nwhich the local squadron was more or less completely merged. Whatever, in\r\nfact, was necessary to secure the local control was done, though, as we\r\nhave seen, and must presently consider more fully, this necessity was not\r\nalways the standard by which the strength of the covering squadron was\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the covering squadron being determined, the next question\r\nis the position or \"tract\" which it should occupy. Like most other\r\nstrategical problems, it is \"an option of difficulties.\" In so far as the\r\nsquadron is designed for support--that is, support from its men, boats, and\r\nguns--it will be desirable to station it as near as possible to the\r\nobjective; but as a covering squadron, with the duty of preventing the\r\nintrusion of an enemy's force, it should be as far away as possible, so as\r\nto engage such a force at the earliest possible moment of its attempt to\r\ninterfere. There is also the paramount necessity that its position must be\r\nsuch that favourable contact with the enemy is certain if he tries to\r\ninterrupt. Usually such certainty is only to be found either in touch with\r\nthe enemy's naval base or in touch with your own landing force. Where the\r\nobjective is the local naval base of the enemy these two points, of course,\r\ntend to be identical strategically, and the position of the covering\r\nsquadron becomes a tactical rather than a strategical question. But the\r\nvital principle of an independent existence holds good, and no matter how\r\ngreat the necessity of support, the covering squadron should never be so\r\ndeeply engaged with the landing force as to be unable to disentangle itself\r\nfor action as a purely naval unit in time to discharge its naval function.\r\nIn other words, it must always be able to act in the same way as a free\r\nfield army covering a siege.\r\n\r\nWhere the objective of the expedition is not the local naval base, the\r\nchoice of a position for the covering squadron will turn mainly on the\r\namount of support which the army is likely to require. If it cannot act by\r\nsurprise, and serious military resistance is consequently to be expected,\r\nor where the coast defences are too strong for the transport squadron to\r\noverpower, then the scale will incline to a position close to the army,\r\nthough the extent to which, under modern conditions, ships at sea can\r\nusefully perform the delicate operation of supporting an infantry attack\r\nwith gun fire, except by enfilading the enemy's position, remains to be\r\nproved. A similar choice will be indicated where strong support of men and\r\nboats is required, as when a sufficiency of flat-boats and steam towage\r\ncannot be provided by the transports and their attendant squadron; or again\r\nwhere the locality is such that amphibious operations beyond the actual\r\nlanding are likely to be called for, and the assistance of a large number\r\nof boats and seamen acting with the army is necessary to give it the\r\namphibious tactical mobility which it would otherwise lack. Such cases\r\noccurred at Quebec in 1759, where Saunders took his covering\r\nbattle-squadron right up the St. Lawrence, although its covering functions\r\ncould have been discharged even better by a position several hundreds of\r\nmiles away from the objective; and again in 1800 at Alexandria, where Lord\r\nKeith ran the extremest hazard to his covering functions in order to\r\nundertake the supply of General Abercromby's army by inland waters and give\r\nhim the mobility he required.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the transport squadron is able to furnish all the\r\nsupport necessary, the covering squadron will take station as close as\r\npossible to the enemy's naval base, and there it will operate according to\r\nthe ordinary laws of blockade. If nothing is desired but to prevent\r\ninterference, its guard will take the form of a close blockade. But if\r\nthere be a subsidiary purpose of using the expedition as a means of forcing\r\nthe enemy to sea, the open form will be employed; as, for instance, in\r\nAnson's case above cited, when he covered the St. Malo expedition not by\r\nclosely blockading Brest, but by taking a position to the eastward at the\r\nIsle de Batz.\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese operations against Manchuria and the Kuantung Peninsula\r\nthese old principles displayed themselves in undiminished vitality. In the\r\nsurprise descents against Seoul and at Takusan the work of support was left\r\nentirely with the transport squadron, while Admiral Togo took up a covering\r\nposition far away at Port Arthur. The two elements of the fleet were kept\r\nseparate all through. But in the operations for the isolation and\r\nsubsequent siege of Port Arthur they were so closely united as to appear\r\nfrequently indistinguishable. Still, so far as the closeness of the landing\r\nplace to the objective permitted, the two acted independently. For the\r\nactual landing of the Second Army the boats of the covering squadron were\r\nused, but it remained a live naval unit all through, and was never\r\norganically mingled with the transport squadron. Its operations throughout\r\nwere, so far as modern conditions permit, on the lines of a close blockade.\r\nTo prevent interference was its paramount function, undisturbed, so far as\r\nwe are able to judge, by any subsidiary purpose of bringing the enemy to\r\ndecisive action.\r\n\r\nAll through the operations, however, there was a new influence which tended\r\nto confuse the precision of the old methods. Needless to say it was the\r\ntorpedo and the mine. Their deflective pressure was curious and\r\ninteresting. In our own operations against Sebastopol, to which the Port\r\nArthur case is most closely comparable, the old rules still held good. On\r\nthe traditional principle, dating from Drake's attack on San Domingo in\r\n1585, a landing place was chosen which gave the mean between facility for a\r\n_coup de main_ and freedom from opposition; that is, it was chosen at the\r\nnearest practicable point to the objective which was undefended by\r\nbatteries and out of reach of the enemy's main army.\r\n\r\nIn the handling of the covering squadron Admiral Dundas, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, gave it its dual function. After explaining the\r\nconstitution of the transport squadron he says, \"The remainder of my force\r\n... will act as a covering squadron, and where practicable assist in the\r\ngeneral disembarkation.\" With these two objects in mind he took a station\r\nnear enough to the landing place to support the army with his guns if it\r\nwere opposed, but still in sight of his cruisers before Sebastopol, and at\r\nsuch a distance that at the first sign of the Russians moving he would have\r\ntime to get before the port and engage them before they could get well to\r\nsea; that is, he took a position as near to the army as was compatible with\r\npreventing interference, or, it may be said, his position was as near to\r\nthe enemy's base as was compatible with supporting the landing. From either\r\naspect in fact the position was the same, and its choice presented no\r\ncomplexity owing mainly to the fact that for the first time steam\r\nsimplified the factors of time and distance.\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese case the application of these principles was not so easy.\r\nIn selecting the nearest undefended point for a landing, it was not only\r\nbatteries, or even the army in Port Arthur, or the troops dispersed in the\r\nLiaotung Peninsula that had to be considered, but rather, as must always be\r\nthe case in the future, mines and mobile torpedo defence. The point they\r\nchose was the nearest practicable bay that was unmined. It was not strictly\r\nout of mobile defence range, but it so happened that it lay behind islands\r\nwhich lent themselves to the creation of fixed defences, and thus it\r\nfulfilled all the recognised conditions. But in so far as the defences\r\ncould be turned by the Russian fleet a covering squadron was necessary, and\r\nthe difficulty of choosing a position for it was complicated by the fact\r\nthat the objective of the combined operations was not merely Port Arthur\r\nitself, but also the squadron it contained. It was necessary, therefore,\r\nnot only to hold off that squadron, but to prevent its escape. This\r\nindicated a close blockade. But for close blockade a position out of night\r\ntorpedo range is necessary, and the nearest point where such a position\r\ncould be secured was behind the defences that covered the disembarkation.\r\nConsequently, in spite of what the strategical conditions dictated, the\r\ncovering squadron was more or less continuously forced back upon the army\r\nand its supporting force, even when the support of the battle-squadron was\r\nno longer required.\r\n\r\nIn the conditions that existed nothing was lost. For the lines of the\r\nJapanese fixed defences were so near to the enemy's base, that by mining\r\nthe entrance of the port Admiral Togo ensured that the enemy's exit would\r\nbe slow enough for him to be certain of getting contact from his defended\r\nanchorage before the Russians could get far to sea. What would happen in a\r\ncase when no such position could be secured is another matter. The landing\r\nplace and supply base of the army must be secured against torpedo attack,\r\nand the principle of concentration of effort would suggest that the means\r\nof defence should not be attenuated by providing the covering squadron with\r\na defended anchorage elsewhere. Thus it would appear that unless the\r\ngeographical conditions permit the covering squadron to use one of its own\r\nnational bases, the drift of recent developments will be to force it back\r\non the army, and thus tend to confuse its duties with those of the\r\ntransport squadron. Hence the increased importance of keeping clear the\r\ndifference in function between the two squadrons.\r\n\r\nTo emphasise the principle of the covering squadron, these two cases may be\r\ncontrasted with the Lissa episode at the end of the Austro-Italian War of\r\n1866. In that case it was entirely neglected, with disastrous results. The\r\nAustrian admiral, Tegethoff, with an inferior fleet had by higher order\r\nbeen acting throughout on the defensive, and was still in Pola waiting for\r\na chance of a counter-stroke. Persano with the superior Italian fleet was\r\nat Ancona, where he practically dominated the Adriatic. In July the\r\nItalians, owing to the failure of the army, were confronted with the\r\nprospect of being forced to make peace on unfavourable terms. To improve\r\nthe position Persano was ordered to take possession of the Austrian island\r\nof Lissa. Without any attempt to organise his fleet on the orthodox British\r\nprinciple he proceeded to conduct the operation with his entire force.\r\nPractically the whole of it became involved in amphibious work, and as soon\r\nas Persano was thus committed, Tegethoff put to sea and surprised him.\r\nPersano was unable to disentangle a sufficient force in time to meet the\r\nattack, and having no compact squadron fit for independent naval action, he\r\nwas decisively defeated by the inferior enemy. According to British\r\npractice, it was clearly a case where, if the operation were to be\r\nundertaken at all, an independent covering squadron should have been told\r\noff either to hold Tegethoff in Pola or to bring him to timely action,\r\naccording to whether the island or the Austrian fleet was the primary\r\nobjective. The reason it was not done may be that Persano was not given a\r\nproper landing force, and he seems to have considered that the whole\r\nstrength of his fleet was needed for the successful seizure of the\r\nobjective. If so, it is only one more proof of the rule that no matter what\r\nfleet support the landing operations may require, it should never be given\r\nin an imperfectly commanded sea to an extent which will deny the\r\npossibility of a covering squadron being left free for independent naval\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe length to which the supporting functions of the fleet may be carried\r\nwill always be a delicate question. The suggestion that its strength must\r\nbe affected by the need of the army for the men of the fleet or its boats,\r\nwhich imply its men as well, will appear heretical. A battle-squadron, we\r\nsay, is intended to deal with the enemy's battle-squadron and its men to\r\nfight the ships, and the mind revolts at the idea of the strength of a\r\nsquadron being fixed by any other standard. Theoretically nothing can seem\r\nmore true, but it is an idea of peace and the study. The atmosphere of war\r\nengendered a wider and more practical view. The men of the old wars knew\r\nthat when a squadron is attached to a combined expedition it is something\r\ndifferent from a purely naval unit. They knew, moreover, that an army\r\nacting oversea against hostile territory is an incomplete organism\r\nincapable of striking its blow in the most effective manner without the\r\nassistance of the men of the fleet. It was the office, then, of the naval\r\nportion of the force not only to defend the striking part of the organism,\r\nbut to complete its deficiencies and lend it the power to strike. Alone and\r\nunaided the army cannot depend on getting itself ashore, it cannot supply\r\nitself, it cannot secure its retreat, nor can it avail itself of the\r\nhighest advantages of an amphibious force, the sudden shift of base or line\r\nof operation. These things the fleet must do for it, and it must do them\r\nwith its men.[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] The Japanese in the late war attempted to do this work by means of a\r\n  highly organized Army Disembarkation Staff, but except in perfect\r\n  conditions of weather and locality it does not seem to have worked well,\r\n  and in almost all cases the assistance of the navy was called in.\r\n\r\nThe authority for this view is abundant. In 1800, for instance, when\r\nGeneral Maitland was charged with an expedition against Belleisle, he was\r\ninvited to state what naval force he would require. He found it difficult\r\nto fix with precision. \"Speaking loosely, however,\" he wrote, \"three or\r\nfour sail of the line and four or five active frigates appear to me to be\r\nproperly adequate to the proposed service. The frigates to blockade.\"\r\n(Meaning, of course, to blockade the objective and prevent reinforcements\r\nreaching it from the mainland, always one of the supporting functions of\r\nthe squadron attached to the transports.) \"The line-of-battle ships,\" he\r\nadds, \"to furnish us with the number of men necessary for land operations.\"\r\nIn this case our permanent blockading squadrons supplied the cover, and\r\nwhat Maitland meant was that the battleships he asked for were to be added\r\nto the transport squadron not as being required for escort, but for\r\nsupport. St. Vincent, who was then First Lord, not only endorsed his\r\nrequest, but gave him for disembarkation work one more ship-of-the-line\r\nthan he had asked for. At this time our general command of the sea had been\r\nvery fully secured, and we had plenty of naval force to spare for its\r\nexercise. It will be well to compare it with a case in which the\r\ncircumstances were different.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1795 the expedition under Admiral Christian and General Abercromby\r\nwas being prepared for the West Indies, the admiral in concert with Jervis\r\ndrew up a memorandum as to the naval force required.[26] The force he asked\r\nfor was considerable. Both he and Jervis considered that the escort and\r\nlocal cover must be very strong, because it was impossible to count on\r\nclosing either Brest or Toulon effectually by blockade. But this was not\r\nthe only reason. The plan of operations involved three distinct landings,\r\nand each would require at least two of the line, and perhaps three, \"not\r\nonly as protection, but as the means by which flat-boats must be manned,\r\ncannon landed, and the other necessary services of fatigue executed.\"\r\nChristian also required the necessary frigates and three or four brigs \"to\r\ncover [that is, support] the operations of the smaller vessels [that is,\r\nthe landing flotillas doing inshore work].\" The main attack would require\r\nat least four of the line and seven frigates, with brigs and schooners in\r\nproportion. In all he considered, the ships-of-the-line [the frigates being\r\n\"otherwise employed\"] would have to provide landing parties to the number\r\nof 2000 men \"for the flat-boats, landing and moving guns, water, and\r\nprovisions,\" and this would be their daily task. The military force these\r\nlanding parties were to serve amounted to about 18,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [26] Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian was an officer of high distinction with\r\n  a remarkable record of battle service. He had been serving as Howe's\r\n  second captain just before his promotion to flag rank in 1795, and died\r\n  as Commander-in-Chief at the Cape at the early age of fifty-one.\r\n\r\nLord Barham, it must be said, who as Sir Charles Middleton was then First\r\nSea Lord, objected to the requirements as excessive, particularly in the\r\ndemand for a strong escort, as he considered that the transit could be\r\nsafeguarded by special vigilance on the part of the permanent blockading\r\nsquadrons. The need for large shore parties he seems to have ignored. His\r\nopinion, however, is not quite convincing, for from the first he had taken\r\nup an antagonistic attitude to the whole idea of the expedition. He\r\nregarded the policy which dictated it as radically unsound, and was\r\nnaturally anxious to restrict the force that was to be spent upon it. His\r\nopposition was based on the broad and far-sighted principles that were\r\ncharacteristic of his strategy. He believed that in view of the threatening\r\nattitude of Spain the right course was to husband the navy so as to bring\r\nit up to a two-Power standard for the coming struggle, and to keep it\r\nconcentrated for decisive naval action the moment Spain showed her hand. In\r\nshort, he stoutly condemned a policy which entailed a serious dissipation\r\nof naval force for a secondary object before a working command of the sea\r\nhad been secured. It was, in fact, the arrangements for this expedition\r\nwhich forced him to resign before the preparations were complete. But it is\r\nto be observed that his objections to the plan were really due, not to the\r\nprinciple of its organisation, but to our having insufficient force to give\r\nit adequate naval support without prejudicing the higher consideration of\r\nour whole position at sea.[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] On analogous grounds almost every military critic has condemned the\r\n  policy of this disastrous expedition as involving a dispersal of our\r\n  slender military force at a time when everything called for its\r\n  concentration in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the foregoing considerations, beyond the strategical\r\nreactions already noted, will have another of the first importance, in that\r\nthey must influence the choice of a landing place. The interest of the army\r\nwill always be to fix it as near to the objective as is compatible with an\r\nunopposed landing. The ideal was one night's march, but this could rarely\r\nbe attained except in the case of very small expeditions, which could be\r\nlanded rapidly at the close of day and advance in the dark. In larger\r\nexpeditions, the aim was to effect the landing far enough from the\r\nobjective to prevent the garrison of the place or the enemy's local forces\r\noffering opposition before a footing was secured. The tendency of the navy\r\nwill usually be in the opposite direction; for normally the further they\r\ncan land the army away from the enemy's strength, the surer are they of\r\nbeing able to protect it against naval interference. Their ideal will be a\r\nplace far enough away to be out of torpedo range, and to enable them to\r\nwork the covering and the transport squadron in sound strategical\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nTo reduce these divergencies to a mean of efficiency some kind of joint\r\nStaff is necessary, and to ensure its smooth working it is no less\r\ndesirable to ascertain, so far as possible, the principles and method on\r\nwhich it should proceed. In the best recent precedents the process has been\r\nfor the Army Staff to present the limits of coast-line within which the\r\nlanding must take place for the operation to have the desired effect, and\r\nto indicate the known practicable landing points in the order they would\r\nprefer them. It will then be for the Naval Staff to say how nearly in\r\naccordance with the views of the army they are prepared to act. Their\r\ndecision will turn on the difficulties of protection and the essentials of\r\na landing place from the point of view of weather, currents, beach and the\r\nlike, and also in a secondary measure upon the extent to which the\r\nconformation of the coast will permit of tactical support by gun-fire and\r\nfeints. If the Naval Staff are unwilling to agree to the point or points\r\ntheir colleagues most desire, a question of balance of risk is set up,\r\nwhich the higher Joint Staff must adjust. It will be the duty of the Naval\r\nStaff to set out frankly and clearly all the sea risks the proposal of the\r\narmy entails, and if possible to suggest an alternative by which the risk\r\nof naval interference can be lessened without laying too heavy a burden on\r\nthe army. Balancing these risks against those stated by the army, the\r\nsuperior Staff must decide which line is to be taken, and each service then\r\nwill do its best to minimise the difficulties it has to face. Whether the\r\nsuperior Staff will incline to the naval or the military view will depend\r\nupon whether the greater danger likely to be incurred is from the sea or on\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWhere the naval conditions are fairly well known the line of operations can\r\nbe fixed in this way with much precision. But if, as usually happens, the\r\nprobable action of the enemy at sea cannot be divined with sufficient\r\napproximation, then assuming there is serious possibility of naval\r\ninterference, the final choice within the limited area must be left to the\r\nadmiral. The practice has been to give him instructions which define in\r\norder of merit the points the army desire, and direct him to select the one\r\nwhich in the circumstances, as he finds them, he considers within\r\nreasonable risk of war. Similarly, if the danger of naval interference be\r\nsmall and the local conditions ashore imperfectly known, the final choice\r\nwill be with the general, subject only to the practicable possibilities of\r\nthe landing place he would choose.\r\n\r\nDuring the best period of our old wars there was seldom any difficulty in\r\nmaking things work smoothly on these lines. After the first inglorious\r\nfailure at Rochefort in 1757 the practice was, where discretion of this\r\nkind had been allowed, for the two commanders-in-chief to make a joint\r\ncoast-reconnaissance in the same boat and settle the matter amicably on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nIt was on these lines the conduct of our combined operations was always\r\narranged thenceforth. Since the elder Pitt's time it has never been our\r\npractice to place combined expeditions under either a naval or a military\r\ncommander-in-chief and allow him to decide between naval and military\r\nexigencies. The danger of possible friction between two commanders-in-chief\r\ncame to be regarded as small compared with the danger of a single one\r\nmaking mistakes through unfamiliarity with the limitations of the service\r\nto which he does not belong.\r\n\r\nThe system has usually worked well even when questions arose which were\r\nessentially questions for a joint superior Staff. The exceptions indeed are\r\nvery few. A fine example of how such difficulties can be settled, when the\r\nspirit is willing, occurred in the Crimea. The naval difficulties, as we\r\nhave already seen, were as formidable as they could well be short of\r\nrendering the whole attempt madness. When it came to the point of execution\r\na joint council of war was held, at which sat the allied Staffs of both\r\nservices. So great were the differences of opinion between the French and\r\nBritish Generals, and so imperfectly was the terrain known, that they could\r\nnot indicate a landing place with any precision. All the admirals knew was\r\nthat it must be on an open coast, which they had not been able to\r\nreconnoitre, where the weather might at any time interrupt communications\r\nwith the shore, and where they were liable to be attacked by a force which,\r\nuntil their own ships were cleared of troops, would not be inferior. All\r\nthese objections they laid before the Council General. Lord Raglan then\r\nsaid the army now perfectly understood the risk, and was prepared to take\r\nit. Whereupon the allied admirals replied that they were ready to proceed\r\nand do their best to set the army ashore and support it at any point that\r\nshould be chosen.\r\n\r\nThere remains a form of support which has not yet been considered, and that\r\nis diversionary movements or feints by the fleet to draw the enemy's\r\nattention away from the landing place. This will naturally be a function of\r\nthe covering battle-squadron or its attendant cruisers and flotilla. The\r\ndevice appears in Drake's attack on San Domingo in 1585, an attack which\r\nmay be regarded as our earliest precedent in modern times and as the\r\npattern to which all subsequent operations of the kind conformed so far as\r\ncircumstances allowed. In that case, while Drake landed the troops a\r\nnight's march from the place, the bulk of the fleet moved before it, kept\r\nit in alarm all night, and at dawn made a demonstration with the boats of\r\nforcing a direct landing under cover of its guns. The result was the\r\ngarrison moved out to meet the threat and were surprised in flank by the\r\nreal landing force. Passing from this simple case to the most elaborate in\r\nour annals, we find Saunders doing the same thing at Quebec. In preparation\r\nfor Wolfe's night landing he made a show of arrangements for a bombardment\r\nof Montcalm's lines below the city, and in the morning with the boats of\r\nthe fleet began a demonstration of landing his marines. By this device he\r\nheld Montcalm away from Wolfe's landing place till a secure footing had\r\nbeen obtained. Similar demonstrations had been made above the city, and the\r\ncombined result was that Wolfe was able to penetrate the centre of the\r\nFrench position unopposed.\r\n\r\nSuch work belongs of course to the region of tactics rather than of\r\nstrategy, but the device has been used with equal effect strategically. So\r\ngreat is the secrecy as well as the mobility of an amphibious force, that\r\nit is extremely difficult for an enemy to distinguish a real attack from a\r\nfeint. Even at the last moment, when a landing is actually in progress, it\r\nis impossible for the defenders to tell that all the troops are being\r\nlanded at the one point if a demonstration is going on elsewhere. At Quebec\r\nit was not till Montcalm was face to face with Wolfe that he knew he had to\r\ndeal with the whole British force. Still less from a strategical point of\r\nview can we be certain whether a particular landing represents an advance\r\nguard or is a diversionary operation to mask a larger landing elsewhere.\r\nThis is a special difficulty when in the case of large operations the\r\nlanding army arrives in echelon like the Second Japanese army. In that\r\ninstance the naval feint was used strategically, and apparently with\r\nconspicuous effect. The Russians were always apprehensive that the Japanese\r\nwould strike for Newchuang at the head of the Gulf of Pe-chi-li, and for\r\nthis reason General Stakelberg, who had command of the troops in the\r\npeninsula, was not permitted to concentrate for effective action in its\r\nsouthern part, where the Japanese had fixed their landing place. Admiral\r\nTogo, in spite of the strain on his fleet in effecting and securing the\r\ndisembarkation of the army, detached a cruiser squadron to demonstrate in\r\nthe Gulf. The precise effect of this feint upon the Russian Staff cannot be\r\nmeasured with certainty. All we know is that Stakelberg was held back from\r\nhis concentration so long that he was unable to strike the Japanese army\r\nbefore it was complete for the field and able to deal him a staggering\r\ncounter-stroke.\r\n\r\nThis power of disturbing the enemy with feints is of course inherent in the\r\npeculiar attributes of combined expeditions, in the facility with which\r\ntheir line of operation can be concealed or changed, and there seems no\r\nreason why in the future it should be less than in the past. Good railway\r\nconnections in the theatre of the descent will of course diminish the\r\neffect of feints, but, on the other hand, the means of making them have\r\nincreased. In mine-sweeping vessels, for instance, there is a new\r\ninstrument which in the Russo-Japanese War proved capable of creating a\r\nvery strong impression at small cost to the fleet. Should a flotilla of\r\nsuch craft appear at any practicable part of a threatened coast and make a\r\nshow of clearing it, it will be almost a moral impossibility to ignore the\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nOn the whole then, assuming the old methods are followed, it would seem\r\nthat with a reasonable naval preponderance the power of carrying out such\r\noperations over an uncommanded sea is not less than it has proved to be\r\nhitherto. The rapidity and precision of steam propulsion perhaps places\r\nthat power higher than ever. It would at any rate be difficult to find in\r\nthe past a parallel to the brilliant movement on Seoul with which the\r\nJapanese opened the war in 1904. It is true the Russians at the last moment\r\ndecided for political reasons to permit the occupation to take place\r\nwithout opposition, but this was unknown to the Japanese, and their\r\narrangements were made on the assumption that their enemy would use the\r\nformidable means at his disposal to obstruct the operation. The risk was\r\naccepted, skillfully measured, and adequately provided for on principles\r\nidentical with those of the British tradition. But, on the other hand,\r\nthere has been nothing to show that where the enemy has a working command\r\nof the sea the hazard of such enterprises has been reduced. Against an\r\nenemy controlling the line of passage in force, the well-tried methods of\r\ncovering and protecting an oversea expedition will no more work to-day than\r\nthey did in the past. Until his hold is broken by purely naval action,\r\ncombined work remains beyond all legitimate risk of war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\"GREEN PAMPHLET\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWAR COURSE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrategical Terms\r\nand Definitions\r\nused in\r\nLectures on Naval History\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nJULIAN S.

It is only\r\na section of a division of the art of war.\r\n\r\nThe study for officers is the art of war, specialising in Naval Strategy.\r\n\r\nThe true method of procedure then is to get hold of a general theory of\r\nwar, and so ascertain the exact relations of Naval Strategy to the whole.\r\n\r\nWar is a form of political intercourse, a continuation of foreign politics\r\nwhich begins when force is introduced to attain our ends.\r\n\r\nOBJECTS.\r\n\r\nWe seek our ends by directing force upon certain objects, which may be\r\nulterior or immediate.\r\n\r\nImmediate objects (also called \"Primary\") are the ends of particular\r\noperations or movements. But it must be remembered that every primary\r\nobject has also its ulterior object; that is, every operation must be\r\nregarded, not only from the point of view of its special object, but also\r\nas a step to the end of the campaign or war.\r\n\r\nStrategy is the art of directing force to the ends in view. Classified by\r\nthe object it is Major Strategy, dealing with ulterior objects; Minor\r\nStrategy, with primary objects.\r\n\r\nThis also means that every operation of an army or fleet must be regarded\r\nin a double light, _i.e._, it must be planned and conducted in relation (1)\r\nto the general progress of the war; (2) to the object to which it is\r\nimmediately directed.\r\n\r\nMajor Strategy (always regarding the ulterior object) has for its province\r\nthe plan of the war, and includes: (1) Selection of the immediate or\r\nprimary objects to be aimed at for attaining the ulterior object; (2)\r\nSelection of the force to be used, i.e., it determines the relative\r\nfunctions of the naval and military forces.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Major Strategy in its broadest sense has also to deal with the\r\n    whole resources of the nation for war. It is a branch of statesmanship.\r\n    It regards the Army and Navy as parts of one force, to be handled\r\n    together; they are instruments of war. But it also has to keep in view\r\n    constantly the politico-diplomatic position of the country (on which\r\n    depends the effective action of the instrument), and its commercial and\r\n    financial position (by which the energy for working the instrument is\r\n    maintained). The friction of these two considerations is inherent in\r\n    war, and we call it the deflection of strategy by politics. It is\r\n    usually regarded as a disease. It is really a vital factor in every\r\n    strategical problem. It may be taken as a general rule that no question\r\n    of grand strategy can be decided apart from diplomacy, and vice versa.\r\n    For a line of action or an object which is expedient from the point of\r\n    view of strategy may be barred by diplomatic considerations, and vice\r\n    versa. To decide a question of grand strategy without consideration of\r\n    its diplomatic aspect, is to decide on half the factors only. Neither\r\n    strategy or diplomacy has ever a clean slate. This interaction has to\r\n    be accepted by commanding officers as part of the inevitable \"friction\r\n    of war.\" A good example is Pitt's refusal to send a fleet into the\r\n    Baltic to assist Frederick the Great during the Seven Years War, for\r\n    fear of compromising our relations with the Scandinavian Powers.\r\n\r\nMinor Strategy has for its province the plans of operations. It deals\r\nwith--\r\n\r\n    (1) The selection of the \"objectives,\" that is, the particular forces\r\n        of the enemy or the strategical points to be dealt with in order\r\n        to secure the object of the particular operation.\r\n    (2) The directing of the force assigned for the operation.\r\n\r\nMinor Strategy may be of three kinds:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Naval, where the immediate object is to be attained by a fleet\r\n        only.\r\n    (2) Military, where the immediate object is to be attained by an army\r\n        only.\r\n    (3) Combined, where the immediate object is to be attained by army\r\n        and navy together.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--It will be seen that what is usually called Naval Strategy or\r\n    Fleet Strategy, is only a sub-division of a division of strategy, and\r\n    that, therefore, strategy cannot be studied from the point of view of\r\n    naval operations only.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Naval Strategy, being only a part of General Strategy, is\r\n    subject to the same friction as Major Strategy, though in a less\r\n    degree. Individual commanders have often to take a decision\r\n    independently of the central government, or headquarters; they should,\r\n    therefore, always keep in mind the possible ulterior effects of any\r\n    line of action they may take, endeavouring to be sure that what is\r\n    strategically expedient is not diplomatically inexpedient.\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLE.--Boscawen's attack on De la Motte on the eve of the Seven\r\n    Years War.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF OBJECT\r\n\r\nThe solution of every strategical problem, whether of Major or Minor\r\nStrategy, depends primarily on the nature of the object in view.\r\n\r\nAll objects, whether ulterior or not, may be positive or negative.\r\n\r\nA positive object is where we seek to assert or acquire something for\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nA negative object is where we seek to deny the enemy something or prevent\r\nhis gaining something.\r\n\r\nWhere the object is positive, Strategy is offensive.\r\n\r\nWhere the object is negative, Strategy is defensive.\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLE.--When Togo attacked Rojesvensky his primary object was\r\n    offensive, _i.e._, to capture or destroy the Russian Fleet. His\r\n    ulterior object was to maintain the defensive function which had been\r\n    assigned to the Japanese Fleet.\r\n\r\n    NOTES.--This is a good example of true defensive; that is, Togo's\r\n    operations, though drastically offensive in action, were all strictly\r\n    within the strategical defensive sphere assigned to him.\r\n\r\nThe Offensive, being positive in its aim is naturally the more effective\r\nform of war (_i.e._, it leads more directly to a final decision), and, as a\r\nrule, should be adopted by the stronger Power.\r\n\r\nThe Defensive, being negative in its aim, is naturally the stronger form of\r\nwar; _i.e._, it requires less force, and, as a rule, is adopted by the\r\nweaker Power.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The general truth of this proposition is not affected by\r\n    apparent exceptions where the contrary appears to be true.\r\n\r\n    _The Offensive must not be confused with the Initiative._ It is\r\n    possible to seize the Initiative, under certain conditions, by taking a\r\n    defensive position from which the enemy is bound to dislodge us or\r\n    abandon the operation.\r\n\r\n    In most cases where the weaker side successfully assumes the offensive,\r\n    it is due to his doing so before the enemy's mobilization or\r\n    concentration is complete, whereby the attacking force is able to deal\r\n    in succession with locally inferior forces of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the Offensive are well known.\r\n\r\nIts disadvantages are:--\r\n\r\n  (1) That it grows weaker as it advances, by prolonging its\r\n      communications.\r\n  (2) That it tends to operations on unfamiliar ground.\r\n  (3) That it continually increases the difficulty of retreat.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of Defence are chiefly:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Proximity to base.\r\n  (2) Familiar ground.\r\n  (3) Facility for arranging surprise by counter attack.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--In modern Naval warfare these advantages--that is, the\r\n    advantages of fighting on your own ground--are specially high as giving\r\n    greater facility for the use of mine and torpedo.\r\n\r\n    The disadvantages are mainly moral or when the enemy's objective or\r\n    line of operations cannot be ascertained, but this disadvantage can be\r\n    neutralised when it is possible to secure an interior position.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEFENSIVE.\r\n\r\nTrue Defensive means waiting for a chance to strike.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--When the Dutch burnt our ships at Chatham, we were not acting on\r\n    the defensive, we had laid them up and were doing nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThe strength and the essence of the defensive is the counter-stroke.\r\n\r\nA well designed defensive will always threaten or conceal an attack.\r\n\r\nA general defensive policy may consist of a series of minor offensive\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe maxim is: If you are not relatively strong enough to assume the\r\noffensive, assume the defensive till you become so--\r\n\r\n(1) Either by inducing the enemy to weaken himself by attacks or otherwise;\r\n\r\n(2) Or by increasing your own strength, by developing new forces or\r\nsecuring allies.\r\n\r\nExcept as a preparation or a cover for offensive action the defensive is\r\nseldom or never of any use; for by the defensive alone we can never acquire\r\nanything, we can only prevent the enemy acquiring. But where we are too\r\nweak to assume the offensive it is often necessary to assume the defensive,\r\nand wait in expectation of time turning the scale in our favour and\r\npermitting us to accumulate strength relatively greater than the enemy's;\r\nwe then pass to the offensive, for which our defensive has been a\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nAs a cover or support for the offensive, the defensive will enable us to\r\nintensify the attack; for by assuming the defensive in one or more minor\r\ntheatres of operation we can reduce our forces in those theatres to a\r\nminimum, and concentrate to a maximum for the offensive in the most\r\nimportant theatre.\r\n\r\nOFFENSIVE OPERATIONS USED WITH A DEFENSIVE INTENTION\r\n\r\n    (A) Counter attacks.\r\n    (B) Diversions.\r\n\r\n(A) _Counter attacks_ are those which are made upon an enemy who exposes\r\nhimself anywhere in the theatre of his offensive operations. It is this\r\nform of attack which constitutes what Clausewitz calls the \"surprise\r\nadvantage of defence.\"\r\n\r\n(B) _Diversions_ are similar operations undertaken against an enemy outside\r\nthe limit of his theatre of offensive operations.\r\n\r\nDiversions are designed to confuse his strategy, to distract his attention,\r\nand to draw off his forces from his main attack. If well planned, they\r\nshould divert a force greater than their own. They should, therefore, be\r\nsmall. The nearer they approach the importance of a real attack the less\r\nlikely they are to divert a force greater than their own.\r\n\r\nIt is only their power of diverting or containing a larger force than their\r\nown that justifies the breach of the law of concentration which they\r\ninvolve.\r\n\r\nThis power depends mainly on suddenness and mobility, and these qualities\r\nare most highly developed in combined expeditions.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--_Diversions_ must be carefully distinguished from _eccentric\r\n    attacks_. _Eccentric attacks_ are true offensive movements. They have a\r\n    positive object, _i.e._, they aim to acquire something from the enemy;\r\n    whereas diversions have a negative object, _i.e._, they aim at\r\n    preventing the enemy doing or acquiring something. Being in the\r\n    category of the weaker form of war, eccentric attacks are usually made\r\n    in greater force than diversions.\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLES.--_Diversion._--Our raid on Washington in 1815. Landing force,\r\n    about 4,000 men. Object, according to official instructions, \"a\r\n    diversion on the coasts of United States of America in favour of the\r\n    army employed in the defence of Canada\"; _i.e._, the intention was\r\n    negative--preventative--defensive.\r\n\r\n    2. _Eccentric Attack._--Operations against New Orleans in 1815.\r\n    Intended force 15,000 to 20,000 men. Object, \"to obtain command of\r\n    embouchure of the Mississippi, and, secondly, to occupy some important\r\n    and valuable possession, by the restoration of which the conditions of\r\n    peace might be improved, &c.\"; _i.e._, the intention was positive--to\r\n    acquire. Compare Rochefort Expedition (diversion) and Belleisle\r\n    (eccentric attack) in the Seven Years War.\r\n\r\n    Note 2.--This distinction gives a threefold classification of combined\r\n    expeditions, as used by Elizabethan strategists.\r\n\r\n          Raids = Diversions.\r\n          Incursions = Eccentric attacks.\r\n          Invasions = True direct offence.\r\n\r\n    Compare these with Sir John Ardagh's classification (Report of Royal\r\n    Commission on Reserve Forces, 1904):--\r\n\r\n      \"Raids,\" not exceeding 10,000 men.\r\n      \"Small expeditions,\" not exceeding 50,000 men.\r\n      \"Dangerous invasion,\" not exceeding 150,000 men.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF ULTERIOR OBJECT\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the ulterior object we get an important classification\r\nof wars, according to whether such object is _limited_ or _unlimited_.\r\n\r\n    (1) War with _limited object_ (\"limited war\") is where we merely seek\r\n    to take from the enemy some particular part of his possessions, or\r\n    interests; _e.g._, Spanish-American War, where the object was the\r\n    liberation of Cuba.\r\n\r\n    (2) _War with an unlimited object_ is where we seek to overthrow the\r\n    enemy completely, so that to save himself from destruction he must\r\n    agree to do our will (become subservient); _e.g._, Franco-German War.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Ulterior objects are not necessarily the same in their nature as\r\n    the immediate (primary or secondary) objects which lead up to them;\r\n    _e.g._, ulterior objects may be offensive, while one or more of the\r\n    immediate objects may be defensive, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLE 1.--Japanese position in the late war. Ulterior object of the\r\n    war (to drive Russians from Manchuria) was offensive (positive).\r\n    Function or ulterior object of the fleet (to cover the invasion) was\r\n    defensive (negative). Its primary object to effect this was to attack\r\n    and destroy the Russian naval force. This was offensive (positive).\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLE 2.--In the Spanish-American War the ulterior object of the war\r\n    was (for the Americans) to eject the Spanish Government from Cuba. This\r\n    was offensive. The ulterior object of the fleet was to prevent the\r\n    Spaniards sending reinforcements or interfering with the intended\r\n    American invasion. This was defensive. The primary object of the fleet\r\n    was to bring the Spanish Fleet to action. This was offensive.\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nHaving determined the nature of the war by the nature of its object\r\n(_i.e._, whether it is offensive or defensive and whether it is limited or\r\nunlimited), strategy has to decide on the system of operations or \"plan of\r\nthe war.\"\r\n\r\nThis depends upon:--\r\n    (1) The theatre of the war.\r\n    (2) The means at our disposal.\r\n\r\n1. _Theatre of the War._--Usually defined as \"all the territory upon which\r\nthe hostile parties may assail each other.\" This is insufficient. For an\r\nisland power the theatre of war will always include sea areas. Truer\r\ndefinition: \"geographical areas within which lie the ulterior objects of\r\nthe war and the subordinate objects that lead up to them.\"\r\n\r\nA \"theatre of war\" may contain several \"theatres of operations.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Theatre of Operations_.--Is generally used of the operations of one\r\nbelligerent only.\r\n\r\nAn \"operation\" is any considerable strategical undertaking.\r\n\r\nA \"theatre of operations\" is usually defined as embracing all the territory\r\nwe seek to take possession of or to defend.\r\n\r\nA truer definition is, \"the area, whether of sea or land or both, within\r\nwhich the enemy must be overpowered before we can secure the object of the\r\nparticular operation.\"\r\n\r\nConsequently, since the nature of the war varies with the object, it may be\r\ndefensive in one theatre of operations and offensive in another.\r\n\r\nWhere the operations are defensive in character any special movement or\r\nmovements may be offensive.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nAn objective is \"any point or force against which an offensive movement is\r\ndirected.\" Thus where the _object_ in any theatre of operation is to get\r\ncommand of a certain sea in which the enemy maintains a fleet, that fleet\r\nwill usually be the _objective_.\r\n\r\nLINES OF OPERATION\r\n\r\nA line of operation is \"the area of land or sea through which we operate\r\nfrom our base or starting point to reach our objectives.\"\r\n\r\nLines of operation may be exterior or interior. We are said to hold the\r\ninterior lines when we hold such a position, in regard to a theatre of\r\noperations, that we can reach its chief objective points, or forces, more\r\nquickly than the enemy can move to their defence or assistance. Such a\r\nposition is called an interior position. \"Exterior Lines\" and \"Exterior\r\nPosition\" are the converse of these.\r\n\r\nLINES OF COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nThis expression is used of three different things:--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Lines of supply_, running from the base of operations to the point\r\n    which the operating force has reached.\r\n\r\n    (2) _Lines of lateral communication_ by which several forces engaged in\r\n    one theatre of operations can communicate with each other and move to\r\n    each other's support.\r\n\r\n    (3) _Lines of retreat_, which are lines of supply reversed, _i.e._,\r\n    leading back to the base.\r\n\r\nThese three ideas are best described by the term \"lines of passage and\r\ncommunication,\" which we had in use at the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nAshore, lines of passage and communication are roads, railways, waterways,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nAt sea, they may be regarded as those waters over which passes the normal\r\ncourse of vessels proceeding from the base to the objective or the force to\r\nbe supplied.\r\n\r\nIn Land Strategy the great majority of problems are problems of\r\ncommunication. Maritime Strategy has never been regarded as hinging on\r\ncommunications, but probably it does so even more than Land Strategy, as\r\nwill appear from a consideration of maritime communications, and the extent\r\nto which they are the main preoccupation of Naval operations.\r\n\r\nMARITIME COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of Maritime Communications for or against which a fleet\r\nmay have to operate are:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Its own communications, or those of its adversary (which correspond\r\n    to the communications of armies operating ashore). These tend to\r\n    increase in importance strategically with the increasing hunger of\r\n    modern fleets (for coal, ammunition, &c).\r\n\r\n    (2) The communications of an army operating from an advanced oversea\r\n    base, that is communication between the advanced and the main base.\r\n\r\n    (3) Trade Routes, that is the communications upon which depend the\r\n    national resources and the supply of the main bases, as well as the\r\n    \"lateral\" or connecting communications between various parts of\r\n    belligerents' possessions.\r\n\r\nN.B.--Such \"lines of passage and communication\" are the preoccupation of\r\nNaval Strategy; that is to say, problems of Naval Strategy can be reduced\r\nto terms of \"passage and communication\" and this is probably the best\r\nmethod of solving them.\r\n\r\nNAVAL STRATEGY CONSIDERED AS A\r\nQUESTION OF PASSAGE AND\r\nCOMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nBy \"Naval Strategy\" we mean the art of conducting the operations of the\r\nFleet. Such operations must always have for their object \"passage and\r\ncommunication\"; that is, the Fleet is mainly occupied in guarding our own\r\ncommunications and seizing those of the enemy.\r\n\r\nPROOF I.--_Deductive_.--We say the aim of Naval Strategy is to get command\r\nof the sea. What does this mean? It is something quite different from the\r\nMilitary idea of occupying territory, for the sea cannot be the subject of\r\npolitical dominion or ownership. We cannot subsist upon it (like an army on\r\nconquered territory), nor can we exclude neutrals from it. Admiral Colomb's\r\ntheory of \"conquest of water territory,\" therefore, involves a false\r\nanalogy, and is not safe as the basis of a strategical system. What then is\r\nthe value of the sea in the political system of the world? Its value is as\r\na means of communication between States and parts of States. Therefore the\r\n\"command of the sea\" means the control of communications in which the\r\nbelligerents are adversely concerned.\r\n\r\n    COROLLARY.--The command of the sea can never be, like the conquest of\r\n    territory, the ulterior object of a war, unless it be a purely maritime\r\n    war, as were approximately our wars with the Dutch in the 17th century,\r\n    but it may be a primary or immediate object, and even the ulterior\r\n    object of particular operations.\r\n\r\nPROOF II.--_Inductive_, from history or past experience.--History shows\r\nthat the actual functions of the Fleet (except in purely maritime wars)\r\nhave been threefold.\r\n\r\n1. The prevention or securing of alliances (_i.e._, deterring or persuading\r\nneutrals as to participating in the war).\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLES.--The operations of Rooke in the first years of the War of the\r\n    Spanish Succession, 1702-04, to secure the adhesion of Savoy and\r\n    Portugal to the Grand Alliance. Operations of Nelson to maintain the\r\n    alliance of the Kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\n    In the first case there came a crisis when it was more important to\r\n    demonstrate to Savoy and Portugal what they stood to lose by joining\r\n    Louis XIV than to act immediately against the Toulon Fleet. In the\r\n    second, the Neapolitan Alliance was essential to our operations in the\r\n    Eastern Mediterranean; the destruction of the Toulon Fleet was not.\r\n\r\n2. The protection or destruction of commerce.\r\n\r\n3. The furtherance or hindrance of military operations ashore.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The above is the best working \"Definition of Naval Strategy,\" as\r\nemphasising its intimate connection with diplomatic, financial, and\r\nmilitary aspects of major strategy.\r\n\r\nThese functions may be discharged in two ways:--\r\n\r\n    (1) By direct territorial attacks, threatened or performed\r\n    (bombardment, landing, raiding parties, &c).\r\n\r\n    (2) By getting command of the sea, _i.e._, establishing ourselves in\r\n    such a position that we can control the maritime communications of all\r\n    parties concerned, so that we can operate by sea against their\r\n    territory, commerce, and allies, and they cannot operate against ours.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The power of the second method, by controlling communications,\r\n    is out of all proportion to the first--direct attack. Indeed, the first\r\n    can seldom be performed with any serious effect without the second.\r\n    Thus, from this point of view also, it is clear that Naval Strategy is\r\n    mainly a question of communications.\r\n\r\n    But not entirely. Circumstances have arisen when the Fleet must\r\n    discharge part of its function by direct action before there is time\r\n    to get general control of the communications. (That is, political and\r\n    military considerations may deflect normal operation of Naval\r\n    Strategy.)\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLE.--Rooke's capture of Gibraltar in 1704, in the face of the\r\n    unshaken Toulon Fleet. Japanese invasion of Manchuria.\r\n\r\nCOMMAND OF THE SEA\r\n\r\nCommand of the sea exists only in a state of war. If we say we have command\r\nof the sea in time of peace it is a rhetorical expression meaning that we\r\nhave (a) adequate Naval positions; (b) an adequate Fleet to secure the\r\ncommand when war breaks out.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS CONDITIONS OF COMMAND\r\n\r\n1. It may be (a) general; (b) local.\r\n\r\n(a) _General command_ is secured when the enemy is no longer able to act\r\ndangerously against our line of passage and communication or to defend his\r\nown, or (in other words) when he is no longer able to interfere seriously\r\nwith our trade or our military or diplomatic operations.\r\n\r\nThis condition exists practically when the enemy is no longer able to send\r\nsquadrons to sea.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Command of the sea does not mean that the enemy can do\r\n    absolutely nothing, but that he cannot _seriously_ interfere with the\r\n    undertakings by which we seek to secure the object of the war, or to\r\n    force our will upon him.\r\n\r\n(b) _Local command_ implies a state of things in which we are able to\r\nprevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in\r\none or more theatres of operation.\r\n\r\n2. Both local and general command may be (a) temporary; (b) permanent.\r\n\r\n(a) _Temporary command_ is when we are able to prevent the enemy from\r\ninterfering with our passage and communication in all or some theatres of\r\noperation during the period required for gaining the object in view\r\n(_i.e._, the object of a particular operation or of a particular campaign).\r\nThis condition existed after Togo's first action.\r\n\r\n(b) _Permanent command_ is when time ceases to be a vital factor in the\r\nsituation, _i.e._, when the possibility of the enemy's recovering his\r\nmaritime position is too remote to be a practical consideration. This\r\ncondition existed after Tsushima.\r\n\r\n3. Command, whether general, local, or temporary, may be in three different\r\nstates:--\r\n\r\n  (a) With us.\r\n  (b) With the enemy.\r\n  (c) In dispute.\r\n\r\nIf in dispute, it may be that:--\r\n\r\n  (1) We have preponderance.\r\n  (2) Our enemy has preponderance.\r\n  (3) Neither side preponderates.\r\n\r\nCOMMAND IN DISPUTE\r\n\r\nThe state of dispute is the most important for practical strategy, since it\r\nis the normal condition, at least in the early stages of the war, and\r\nfrequently all through it.\r\n\r\nThe state of dispute continues till a final decision is obtained, _i.e._,\r\ntill one side is no longer able to send a squadron to sea.\r\n\r\nIt is to the advantage of the preponderating Navy to end the state of\r\ndispute by seeking a decision. Hence the French tradition to avoid decisive\r\nactions as a rule when at war with England.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this appears from the fact that _general command of the sea is\r\nnot essential to all oversea operations_.\r\n\r\nIn a state of dispute the preponderating Power may concentrate in one\r\ntheatre of operations, and so secure the local or temporary command\r\nsufficient for obtaining the special object in view. The weaker Power may\r\ntake advantage of such local concentration to operate safely elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Rule 1._ So long as a state of dispute can force the preponderating Power\r\nto concentrate, operating by evasion is possibly open to the weaker.\r\n\r\n_Rule 2._ In a state of dispute although the weaker Power may not be able\r\nto obstruct the passage and communication of the stronger, it may be able\r\nto defend its own.\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLES.--This condition of dispute existed during the first three\r\n    years of the Seven Years War, until Hawke and Boscawen obtained a\r\n    decision by defeating Conflans and De la Cloue; also in the Great War\r\n    up to Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nSHOULD COMMAND OF THE SEA ALWAYS BE THE\r\nPRIMARY OBJECT?\r\n\r\nWhen the preponderating Power fails or neglects to get command (_i.e._,\r\nleaves the general command in dispute), the disadvantage to him is not so\r\nmuch the danger to his own operations as the facility given to the enemy\r\nfor carrying out counter operations elsewhere.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions, therefore, it may not be the primary function of\r\nthe fleet to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it, because general\r\ncommand may be in dispute while local command may be with us, and political\r\nor military considerations may demand of us an operation, for which such\r\nlocal command is sufficient, and which cannot be delayed until we have\r\nobtained a complete decision.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will appear \"command of the sea\" is too loose an\r\nexpression for strategical discussion. For practical purposes should be\r\nsubstituted \"_control of passage and communication_.\"\r\n\r\nThe question then in the consideration of any proposed operation or line of\r\noperations will be, not \"Have we the command of the sea?\" but \"Can we\r\nsecure the necessary lines of communication from obstruction by the enemy?\"\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF SECURING CONTROL\r\n\r\n1. _Permanent general control_ can only be secured by the practical\r\nannihilation of the enemy's fleet by successful actions.\r\n\r\n2. _Local and temporary control_ may be secured by:--\r\n\r\n    (a) A defensive action not necessarily entirely successful\r\n    (containing).\r\n\r\n    (b) Forcing concentration on the enemy elsewhere (diversion).\r\n\r\n    (c) Superior concentration so as to render impotent the enemy's force\r\n    available in the special theatre of operations (masking or containing).\r\n\r\nBLOCKADE\r\n\r\nBlockades are of two natures, according to the object review. The object\r\nmay be:--\r\n\r\n(d) Blockade.\r\n\r\n    i. _Close blockade_ to prevent the enemy putting to sea. The object\r\n    being usually to secure local or temporary control.\r\n\r\n    ii. _Observation blockade_, to force the enemy to put to sea _by\r\n    occupying the common lines of communications_ (_see_ below). In this\r\n    case you are seeking a decision as a step towards general control.\r\n\r\nBoth natures are operations upon the lines of passage and communication,\r\nbut in case (1) the primary intention is defensive, to secure our own line;\r\nin case (2) the primary intention is offensive, to seize the enemy's line\r\nand compel him to expose himself in an attempt to recover it.\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES FOR CONDUCTING BLOCKADES\r\n\r\nIn case (1) (defensive intention) blockade should be as close as is\r\ncompatible with security from torpedo attack.\r\n\r\nIn case (2) (offensive intention) it should be as distant as is compatible\r\nwith bringing enemy to action if he comes out.\r\n\r\n    Examples:--_Case_ (1): First stage of Togo's blockade of Port Arthur.\r\n    _Case_ (2): Nelson off Toulon.\r\n    _Confusion of the two_: Sampson's attempt to close Santiago\r\n    simultaneously with an attempt to force Cervera to sea.\r\n\r\nTHE PECULIARITY OF MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nSince the whole idea of command of the sea and the whole theory of blockade\r\nrest on the control of communications, neither can be fully apprehended\r\nwithout a thorough understanding of the nature of maritime communications.\r\n\r\nAshore, the respective lines of communications of each belligerent tend to\r\nrun more or less approximately in opposite directions, until they meet in\r\nthe theatre of operations or the objective point.\r\n\r\nAt sea the reverse is the case; for in maritime warfare the great lines of\r\ncommunications of either belligerent tend to run approximately parallel,\r\nif, indeed, they are not identical.\r\n\r\nThus, in the case of a war with Germany, the object of which lay in the\r\nEastern Mediterranean, or in America, or South Africa, our respective lines\r\nof communication would be identical.\r\n\r\nThis was also the case in all our imperial wars with France.\r\n\r\n_This peculiarity is the controlling influence of maritime warfare._ Nearly\r\nall our current maxims of Naval strategy can be traced to the pressure it\r\nexerts on Naval thought.\r\n\r\nIt is at the root of the fundamental difference between Military and Naval\r\nstrategy, and affords the explanation of much strategical error and\r\nconfusion, which has arisen from applying the principles of land warfare to\r\nthe sea without allowing for the antagonistic conditions of the\r\ncommunications and operations against them in each case.\r\n\r\nOn land the chief reason for not always striking the enemy's communications\r\nat once is that as a rule we cannot do so without exposing our own.\r\n\r\nAt sea, on the contrary, since the great lines are common to both, we\r\ncannot defend our own without striking at the enemy's.\r\n\r\nTherefore, at sea, the obvious opening is to get your fleet into such a\r\nposition that it controls the common lines, unless defeated or evaded.\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLE.--This was usually done in our old wars with France, by our\r\n    getting a fleet off Brest before the French could sail.\r\n\r\nHence the maxim \"that the proper place for our fleets is off the enemy's\r\ncoast,\" \"the enemy's coast is our true frontier,\" and the like.\r\n\r\nBut these maxims are not universally true, witness Togo's strategy against\r\nRojesvensky, when he remained correctly upon his own coast.\r\n\r\nTake again the maxim that the primary object of the fleet is to seek out\r\nthe enemy's fleet and destroy it.\r\n\r\nHere again Togo's practice was the reverse of the maxim.\r\n\r\nThe true maxim is \"The primary object of the fleet is to secure\r\ncommunications, and if the enemy's fleet is in a position to render them\r\nunsafe it must be put out of action.\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy's fleet usually is in this position, but not always.\r\n\r\n    EXAMPLE.--Opening of War of Spanish Succession. The operations of 1702\r\n    were to secure some point (Cadiz, Gibraltar, or Ferrol) on the Spanish\r\n    trade communications, the French lateral communications, and our own\r\n    lines of passage to the Mediterranean, where was to be our chief\r\n    theatre of operation. These last two lines were identical. 1703.--Chief\r\n    operations had for their object to secure the alliance of Savoy, and\r\n    particularly of Portugal, and with same object in view, Rooke's\r\n    official instructions directed that the French fleet was to be ignored\r\n    unless it threatened our communications.\r\n\r\n    RESULT.--By 1704 we had gained a Naval position from which France could\r\n    not eject us, and she abandoned struggle for sea communications.\r\n\r\nBut nine times out of ten the maxim of seeking out the enemy's fleet, &c.,\r\nis sound and applicable:--\r\n\r\n    (a) Because for us _general permanent command_ is usually essential\r\n    to ultimate success, and this cannot be obtained without destroying the\r\n    enemy's fleet.\r\n\r\n    (b) Because usually the enemy's fleet opens with an attempt _to\r\n    control the common communications_.\r\n\r\n    (c) Because usually the functions of the fleet are so complex\r\n    (_i.e._, the calls upon it so numerous) that it will seek to strike a\r\n    blow which solve all the difficulties; _e.g._, Sir Palmes Fairborne's\r\n    solution of the problem in 1703 (_England in the Mediterranean_, Vol.\r\n    II., p. 234).\r\n\r\nAlso it must be remembered that nine times out of ten the most effective\r\nway of \"seeking out the enemy's fleet\" (_i.e._, forcing an action on him)\r\nis to seize a position which controls communications vital to his plan of\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThis was what happened in 1704. Rooke was unable to seek out the Toulon\r\nfleet, but by seizing Gibraltar he made it come to him (not intentionally,\r\nbut by the operation of inevitable strategical law).\r\n\r\nCompare Togo's strategy and that of the Americans in 1898.\r\n\r\nPractically all great Naval actions have been brought about in this way,\r\nthat is they have been the outcome on an effort to clear essential\r\ncommunications from the enemy's fleet, _e.g._, Gravelines, La Hogue,\r\nQuiberon, Trafalgar, Tsushima.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the great actions of the old Dutch wars were brought about\r\nbecause our geographical position placed us astride the Dutch trade\r\ncommunications, and they were forced to seek a decision against our fleet.\r\n\r\nFINAL NOTE\r\n\r\nIn applying the maxim of \"seeking out the enemy's fleet\" it should be borne\r\nin mind:--\r\n\r\n    (1) That if you seek it out with a superior force you will probably\r\n    find it in a place where you cannot destroy it except at heavy cost.\r\n\r\n    (2) That seeing that the defensive is a stronger form of war than the\r\n    offensive, it is _prima facie_ better strategy to make the enemy come\r\n    to you than to go to him and seek a decision on his own ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWAR COURSE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotes on Strategy\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\nNaval strategy is a section of the Art of War.\r\n\r\nThe study for officers is the Art of War, which includes Naval Strategy.\r\n\r\nWar is the application of force to the attainment of political ends.\r\n\r\nMAJOR AND MINOR STRATEGY\r\n\r\nWe seek our ends by directing force upon certain objects, which may be\r\nulterior or primary.\r\n\r\n_Primary objects_ are the special objects of particular operations or\r\nmovements which we undertake in order to gain the ulterior object of the\r\ncampaign. Consequently it must be remembered that every particular\r\noperation or movement must be regarded, not only from the point of view of\r\nits special object, but also as a step to the end of the campaign or war.\r\n\r\nStrategy is the art of directing force to the ends in view. There are two\r\nkinds--Major Strategy, dealing with ulterior objects; Minor Strategy, with\r\nprimary objects.\r\n\r\nEvery operation of an army or fleet must be planned and conducted in\r\nrelation (1) to the general plan of the war; (2) to the object to which it\r\nis immediately directed.\r\n\r\nMajor Strategy, always regarding the ulterior object, has for its province\r\nthe plan of the war and includes: (1) Selection of the immediate or primary\r\nobjects to be aimed at for attaining the ulterior object; (2) Selection of\r\nthe force to be used, _i.e._, it determines the relative functions of the\r\nnaval and military forces. Major Strategy in its broadest sense deals with\r\nthe whole resources of the nation for war. It is a branch of statesmanship\r\nwhich regards the Army and Navy as parts of one force, to be handled\r\ntogether as the instrument of war. But it also has to keep in constant\r\ntouch with the political and diplomatic position of the country (on which\r\ndepends the effective action of the instrument), and the commercial and\r\nfinancial position (by which the energy for working the instrument is\r\nmaintained). The friction due to these considerations is inherent in war,\r\nand is called the deflection of strategy by politics. It is usually\r\nregarded as a disease. It is really a vital factor in every strategical\r\nproblem. It may be taken as a general rule that no question of major\r\nstrategy can be decided apart from diplomacy, and _vice versâ_. For a line\r\nof action or an object which is expedient from the point of view of\r\nstrategy may be barred by diplomatic considerations, and _vice versâ_. To\r\ndecide a question of Major Strategy, without consideration of its\r\ndiplomatic aspect, is to decide on half the factors only. Neither strategy\r\nor diplomacy has ever a clean slate. This inter-action has to be accepted\r\nas part of the inevitable \"friction of war.\" A good example is Pitt's\r\nrefusal to send a fleet into the Baltic to assist Frederick the Great\r\nduring the Seven Years' War, for fear of compromising our relations with\r\nthe Scandinavian Powers.\r\n\r\nMinor Strategy has for its province the plans of operations. It deals\r\nwith--\r\n\r\n    (1) The selection of the \"objectives,\" that is, the particular forces\r\n    of the enemy or the strategical points to be dealt with in order to\r\n    secure the object of the particular operation.\r\n\r\n    (2) The direction of the force assigned for the operation.\r\n\r\nMinor Strategy may, therefore, be of three kinds:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Naval, where the immediate object is to be attained by a fleet\r\n    only.\r\n\r\n    (2) Military, where the immediate object is to be attained by an army\r\n    only.\r\n\r\n    (3) Combined, where the immediate object is to be attained by army and\r\n    navy together.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that what is usually called Naval Strategy or\r\nFleet Strategy is only a sub-division of Strategy, and that therefore\r\nStrategy cannot be studied from the point of view of naval operations only.\r\nNaval Strategy, being a part of General Strategy, is subject to the same\r\nfriction as Major Strategy, though in a less degree. Individual commanders\r\nhave often to take a decision independently of the central government or\r\nheadquarters; they should, therefore, always keep in mind the possible\r\nulterior effects of any line of action they may take, endeavouring to be\r\nsure that what is strategically expedient is not diplomatically\r\ninexpedient.\r\n\r\nExample.--For example, take Boscawen's attack on De la Motte on the eve of\r\nthe Seven Years' War in 1755. His orders were to prevent the troops and\r\nwarlike stores which De la Motte was taking out from reaching Canada. It\r\nwas not diplomatically expedient to open hostilities; but if Boscawen\r\nsucceeded, the result would have been worth the diplomatic consequences it\r\nwould entail. He missed the expedition, but captured two isolated vessels;\r\nthus striking the first blow in such a way as to entail the utmost amount\r\nof harm with the least possible good.\r\n\r\nOFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE\r\n\r\n_Nature of Object_\r\n\r\nUpon the nature of the object depends the fundamental distinction between\r\n_offensive_ and _defensive_, upon which all strategical calculation must be\r\nbased. Consequently, the solution of every strategical problem, whether of\r\nMajor or Minor Strategy, depends primarily on the nature of the object in\r\nview.\r\n\r\nAll objects, whether ulterior or not, may be positive or negative.\r\n\r\nA _positive_ object is where we seek to assert or acquire something for\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nA _negative_ object is where we seek to deny the enemy something or prevent\r\nhis gaining something.\r\n\r\nWhere the object is positive, Strategy is offensive.\r\n\r\nWhere the object is negative, Strategy is defensive.\r\n\r\nThis is the only certain test by which we can decide whether any particular\r\noperation is offensive or defensive.\r\n\r\nUlterior objects are not necessarily the same in their nature as the\r\nprimary or secondary objects which lead up to them; _e.g._, ulterior\r\nobjects may be offensive, while one or more of the primary objects may be\r\ndefensive, and _vice versâ_. For example, in the Russo-Japanese War the\r\nulterior object of the war (to drive Russians from Manchuria) was offensive\r\n(positive). The ulterior object of the fleet (to cover the invasion) was\r\ndefensive (negative). Its primary object to effect this was to attack and\r\ndestroy the Russian naval force. This was offensive (positive).\r\n\r\n_Relation of Offensive to Defensive_\r\n\r\nThe Offensive, being positive in its aim, is naturally the more effective\r\nform of war and, as a rule, should be adopted by the stronger Power. The\r\nDefensive, being negative in its aim, is the more lasting form of war,\r\nsince it requires less force to keep what one has than to take what is\r\nanother's, and, as a rule, is adopted by the weaker Power. In most cases\r\nwhere the weaker side successfully assumes the offensive, it is due to his\r\ndoing so before the enemy's mobilization or concentration is complete,\r\nwhereby the attacking force is able to deal in succession with locally\r\ninferior forces of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the Offensive are well known.\r\n\r\nIts disadvantages are:--\r\n\r\n    That it grows weaker as it advances, by prolonging its communications,\r\n    and that it tends to operations on unfamiliar ground.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the Defensive are chiefly:--\r\n\r\n    Proximity to the base of supply and repair stations, familiar ground,\r\n    facility for arranging surprise by counter attack, and power of\r\n    organising in advance.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of the Defensive are mainly moral. They become, however,\r\nreal and practical when the enemy's objective or line of operations cannot\r\nbe ascertained, for then we have to spread or attenuate our force to cover\r\nall probable objectives, but this disadvantage can be neutralised when it\r\nis possible to secure an interior position.\r\n\r\n_Functions and Characteristics of the Defensive_\r\n\r\nTrue Defensive means waiting for a chance to strike.\r\n\r\nTo assume the defensive does not necessarily mean that we do not feel\r\nstrong enough to attack. It may mean that we see our way by using the\r\ndefensive to force certain movements on the enemy which will enable us to\r\nhit harder.\r\n\r\nA well-designed defensive will always threaten or conceal an attack. Unless\r\nit does this it will not deflect the enemy's strategy in our favour. Thus,\r\nin 1756, the French, by assuming the defensive in the Channel, threatened\r\nan attack on our coasts, and concealed their attack on Minorca.\r\n\r\nThis power inherent in the defensive is peculiarly strong in naval warfare,\r\nsince the mobility of fleets enables them to pass instantaneously from the\r\ndefensive to the offensive without any warning. When we assume the\r\ndefensive because we are too weak for the offensive, we still do not lay\r\naside attack. The whole strength and essence of the defensive is the\r\ncounter-stroke. Its cardinal idea is to force the enemy to attack us in a\r\nposition where he will expose himself to a counter-stroke.\r\n\r\nThe stock instance upon which naval defensive is usually condemned is the\r\nburning of our ships at Chatham by the Dutch. But in that case we were not\r\n_acting on the defensive_ at all. We had laid up our battle fleet and were\r\ndoing nothing. We were purely passive, in expectation of peace. It is\r\nreally an instance of the successful use of defensive _by the Dutch_. Being\r\nno longer strong enough for a general offensive, they assumed the\r\ndefensive, and induced us to lay up our ships and so expose ourselves to a\r\ncounter-stroke. It was a counterstroke by the worsted belligerent to get\r\nbetter terms of peace.\r\n\r\nSo far is the defensive from excluding the idea of attack, that it may\r\nconsist entirely of a series of minor offensive operations. Clausewitz\r\ncalls it \"a shield of blows.\" It is often called _offensive-defensive,_ or\r\n_active defence_. Neither term is really necessary. For a defensive which\r\nexcludes the idea of offence or action is not war at all-at least at sea.\r\nThe old Elizabethan term _Preventive_ most closely expresses the idea.\r\n\r\nThe most important function of the defensive is that of covering,\r\nbuttressing, and intensifying the main attack. No plan of campaign, however\r\nstrong the offensive intention, is perfect which does not contemplate the\r\nuse of the defensive. Without some use of the defensive the cardinal\r\nprinciple of concentration can rarely be fully developed. To develop the\r\nhighest possible degree of concentration upon the main object or objective,\r\nthe defensive must be assumed everywhere else. Because it is only by using\r\nthe defensive in the minor or less important theatres of operation that the\r\nforces in those theatres can be reduced to the minimum of security, and the\r\nmaximum of concentration can thereby be obtained in the main theatre.\r\n\r\nIn considering the defensive as a general plan of campaign the maxim is: If\r\nnot relatively strong enough to assume the offensive, assume the defensive\r\ntill you become so--\r\n\r\n    (1) Either by inducing the enemy to weaken himself by attacks or\r\n    otherwise;\r\n\r\n    (2) Or by increasing your own strength, by developing new forces or\r\n    securing allies.\r\n\r\nIt must always be remembered that, except as a preparation or a cover for\r\noffensive action, the defensive is seldom or never of any use; for by the\r\ncontinued use of the defensive alone nothing can be acquired, though the\r\nenemy may be prevented from acquiring anything. But where we are too weak\r\nto assume the offensive it is often necessary to assume the defensive, and\r\nwait in expectation of time turning the scale in our favour and permitting\r\nus to accumulate strength relatively greater than the enemy's; we then pass\r\nto the offensive, for which our defensive has been a preparation. At sea we\r\nhave had little occasion for the defensive as a general plan. But that is\r\nno reason for neglecting its study. In despising the defensive ourselves we\r\nhave consistently ignored the strength it gives our enemies. The bulk of\r\nour naval history is the story of how we have been baffled and thwarted by\r\nour enemies assuming the defensive at sea in support of their offensive on\r\nland. We have seldom succeeded in treating this attitude with success, and\r\nit is only by studying the defensive we can hope to do so.\r\n\r\n_Offensive Operations used with a Defensive Intention_\r\n\r\n(A) Counter attacks.\r\n(B) Diversions.\r\n\r\n_Counter attacks_ are those which are made upon an enemy who exposes\r\nhimself anywhere in the theatre of his offensive operations. It is this\r\nform of attack which constitutes what Clausewitz calls the \"surprise\r\nadvantage of defence.\"\r\n\r\n_Diversions_ are similar operations undertaken against an enemy outside the\r\nlimit of his theatre of offensive operations.\r\n\r\nDiversions are designed to confuse his strategy, to distract his attention,\r\nand to draw off his forces from his main attack. If well planned, they\r\nshould divert a force greater than their own. They should, therefore, be\r\nsmall. The nearer they approach the importance of a real attack the less\r\nlikely they are to divert a force greater than their own.\r\n\r\nDiversions involve a breach of the law of concentration, and it is only\r\ntheir power of diverting or containing a larger force than their own that\r\njustifies their use.\r\n\r\nThis power depends mainly on suddenness and mobility, and these qualities\r\nare most highly developed in combined expeditions.\r\n\r\n_Diversions_ must be carefully distinguished from _eccentric attacks.\r\nEccentric attacks_ are true offensive movements. They have a positive\r\nobject, _i.e._, they aim to acquire something from the enemy; whereas\r\ndiversions have a negative object, _i.e._, they aim at preventing the enemy\r\ndoing or acquiring something. Eccentric attacks are usually made in greater\r\nforce than diversions.\r\n\r\nExamples.--Diversion.--Our raid on Washington in 1815. Landing force,\r\nabout 4,000 men. Object, according to official instruction, \"a diversion\r\non the coasts of United States of America in favour of the army\r\nemployed in the defence of Canada\"; _i.e._, the intention was\r\nnegative--preventive--defensive. _Eccentric Attack._--Operations against\r\nNew Orleans in 1815. Intended force, 15,000 to 20,000 men. Object, \"to\r\nobtain command of the embouchure of the Mississippi, and, secondly, to\r\noccupy some important and valuable possession, by the restoration of which\r\nthe conditions of peace might be improved, &c.\"; _i.e._, the intention was\r\npositive--to acquire. Compare Rochefort Expedition (diversion) with those\r\nagainst Martinique and Belleisle (eccentric attacks) in the Seven Years'\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThis distinction gives a threefold classification of combined expeditions,\r\nas used by Elizabethan strategists, viz., raids, incursions, and invasions.\r\nThese correspond respectively with our modern diversions, eccentric\r\nattacks, and true direct offensive.\r\n\r\nLIMITED AND UNLIMITED WARS\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the ulterior object we get an important classification\r\nof wars, according to whether such object is _limited_ or _unlimited_.\r\n\r\n    (1) _War with limited object_ (\"limited war\") is where the object is\r\n    merely to take from the enemy some particular part of his possessions\r\n    or interests; _e.g._, Spanish-American War, where the object was the\r\n    liberation of Cuba.\r\n\r\n    (2) _War with an unlimited object_ is where the object is to overthrow\r\n    the enemy completely, so that to save himself from destruction he must\r\n    agree to do our will (become subservient); _e.g._, Franco-German War.\r\n\r\nPLANS OF WAR\r\n\r\n_System of Operations_\r\n\r\nHaving determined the nature of the war by the nature of its object\r\n(_i.e._, whether it is offensive or defensive and whether it is limited or\r\nunlimited), Strategy has to decide on the system of operations or \"plan of\r\nthe war.\"\r\n\r\nApart from the means at our disposal a plan of war depends mainly upon--\r\n\r\n  (1) The theatre of the war.\r\n  (2) The various theatres of operation available within it.\r\n\r\n1. _Theatre of the War._--Usually defined as \"All the territory upon which\r\nthe hostile parties may assail each other.\" This is insufficient. For an\r\nIsland Power the theatre of war will always include sea areas. Truer\r\ndefinition: \"Geographical areas within which must lie the operations\r\nnecessary for the attainment of the ulterior objects of the war and of the\r\nsubordinate objects that lead up to them.\"\r\n\r\nA \"theatre of war\" may contain several \"theatres of operations.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Theatre of Operations._--Is generally used of the operations of one\r\nbelligerent only.\r\n\r\nAn \"operation\" is any considerable strategical undertaking.\r\n\r\nA \"theatre of operations\" is usually defined as embracing all the territory\r\nwe seek to take possession of or to defend.\r\n\r\nA truer definition is: \"The area, whether of sea or land or both, within\r\nwhich the enemy must be overpowered before we can secure the object of the\r\nparticular operation.\"\r\n\r\nConsequently, since the nature of the war varies with the object, it may be\r\ndefensive in one theatre of operations and offensive in another.\r\n\r\nWhere the operations are defensive in character any special movement or\r\nmovements may be offensive.\r\n\r\nAs the plan of war determines the theatres of operation in the theatre of\r\nwar, so in each theatre of operation it determines the _lines of operation_\r\nand the _objectives_.\r\n\r\n_Objective_\r\n\r\nAn objective is \"any point or force against which an offensive movement is\r\ndirected.\" Thus, where the _object_ in any theatre of operation is to get\r\ncommand of a certain sea in which the enemy maintains a fleet, that fleet\r\nwill usually be the _objective_.\r\n\r\n\"Objective\" in ordinary use is frequently confused with \"object.\" For\r\npurposes of strategical discussion it is desirable to keep them sharply\r\ndistinguished. _Objective_ is the end of some particular movement or\r\noperation, and is the special concern of the officer in command. _Object_\r\nis the end of a system of operations and is the special concern of the\r\ngeneral staff or director of the war. An _objective_ is some definite point\r\nwhich we wish to get from the enemy or prevent his occupying, or some part\r\nof his strength which we wish to destroy. It is incorrect to use the term\r\nof anything we already possess. Thus, Vladivostock is often said to have\r\nbeen Rojesvensky's _objective_. It was, strictly speaking, only his\r\n_destination_. To reach it and concentrate with the units already there was\r\nthe _primary object_ of the operations entrusted to him. He had no true\r\n_objective_ before him except Togo's fleet.\r\n\r\nAn _objective_ is always subordinate to some _object_. It is a step to the\r\nattainment of that object.\r\n\r\n_Lines of Operation_\r\n\r\nA line of operation is \"the area of land or sea through which we operate\r\nfrom our base or starting point to reach our objectives.\"\r\n\r\nLines of operation may be _exterior_ or _interior_. We are said to hold the\r\n_interior_ lines when we hold such a position, in regard to a theatre of\r\noperations, that we can reach its chief objective points, or forces, more\r\nquickly than the enemy can move to their defence or assistance. Such a\r\nposition is called an _interior position_. \"Exterior Lines\" and \"Exterior\r\nPositions\" are the converse of these.\r\n\r\n_Lines of Communication_\r\n\r\nThis expression is used of three different things:--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Lines of supply_, running from the base of operations to the point\r\n    which the operating force has reached.\r\n\r\n    (2) _Lines of lateral communication_ by which several forces engaged in\r\n    one theatre of operations can communicate with each other and move to\r\n    each other's support.\r\n\r\n    (3) _Lines of retreat_, which are usually lines of supply reversed,\r\n    _i.e._, leading back to the base.\r\n\r\nFor naval purposes these three ideas are best described by the term \"lines\r\nof passage and communication,\" which were in use at the end of the 18th\r\ncentury, and they may be regarded as those waters over which passes the\r\nnormal course of vessels proceeding from the base to the objective or the\r\nforce to be supplied.\r\n\r\n_Maritime Communications_\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of Maritime Communications for or against which a fleet\r\nmay have to operate are:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Its own communications, or those of its adversary (which correspond\r\n    to the communications of armies operating ashore). These have greatly\r\n    increased in importance strategically with the increased dependence of\r\n    modern fleets on a regular supply of coals, stores, ammunition, &c.\r\n\r\n    (2) The communications of an army operating from an advanced oversea\r\n    base, that is, communication between the advanced and the main base.\r\n\r\n    (3) Trade Routes, that is, the communications upon which depend the\r\n    national resources and the supply of the main bases, as well as the\r\n    \"lateral\" or connecting communications between various parts of\r\n    belligerents' possessions.\r\n\r\nIn Land Strategy the great majority of problems are problems of\r\ncommunication. Maritime Strategy has never been regarded as hinging on\r\ncommunications, but probably it does so, as will appear from a\r\nconsideration of Maritime Communications, and the extent to which they are\r\nthe main preoccupation of naval operations; that is to say, all problems of\r\nNaval Strategy can be reduced to terms of \"passage and communication,\" and\r\nthis is probably the best method of solving them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\nNAVAL STRATEGY CONSIDERED AS A\r\nQUESTION OF PASSAGE AND\r\nCOMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nNAVAL STRATEGY DEFINED\r\n\r\nBy \"Naval Strategy\" we mean the art of conducting the major operations of\r\nthe fleet. Such operations have for their object \"passage and\r\ncommunication\"; that is, the fleet is mainly occupied in guarding our own\r\ncommunications and seizing those of the enemy.\r\n\r\nWe say the aim of Naval Strategy is to get command of the sea. This means\r\nsomething quite different from the military idea of occupying territory,\r\nfor the sea cannot be the subject of political dominion or ownership. We\r\ncannot subsist upon it (like an army on conquered territory), nor can we\r\nexclude neutrals from it. The value of the sea in the political system of\r\nthe world is as a means of communication between States and parts of\r\nStates. Therefore the \"command of the sea\" means the control of\r\ncommunications in which the belligerents are adversely concerned. The\r\ncommand of the sea can never be, like the conquest of territory, the\r\nulterior object of a war, unless it be a purely maritime war, as were\r\napproximately our wars with the Dutch in the 17th century, but it may be a\r\nprimary or immediate object, and even the ulterior object of particular\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nHistory shows that the actual functions of the fleet (except in purely\r\nmaritime wars) have been threefold:--\r\n\r\n    1. The furtherance or hindrance of military operations ashore.\r\n\r\n    2. The protection or destruction of commerce.\r\n\r\n    3. The prevention or securing of alliances (_i.e._, deterring or\r\n    persuading neutrals as to participating in the war).\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.--The operations of Rooke in the first years of the War of the\r\nSpanish Succession, 1702-04, to secure the adhesion of Savoy and Portugal\r\nto the Grand Alliance. Operations of Nelson to maintain the alliance of the\r\nKingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, there came a crisis when it was more important to\r\ndemonstrate to Savoy and Portugal what they stood to lose by joining Louis\r\nXIV, than to act immediately against the Toulon Fleet. In the second, the\r\nNeapolitan Alliance was essential to our operations in the Eastern\r\nMediterranean; the destruction of the Toulon Fleet was not.\r\n\r\nIn this way we get a _Definition of the Aim of Naval Strategy_, expressed\r\nin terms of the actual functions of the fleet. For practical purposes it\r\nwill be found the most useful definition as emphasising the intimate\r\nconnection of Naval Strategy with the diplomatic, financial, and military\r\naspects of Major Strategy.\r\n\r\nThese functions of the fleet may be discharged in two ways:--\r\n\r\n    (1) By direct territorial attacks, threatened or performed\r\n    (bombardment, landings, raiding parties, &c.).\r\n\r\n    (2) By getting command of the sea, _i.e._, establishing ourselves in\r\n    such a position that we can control the maritime communications of all\r\n    parties concerned, so that we can operate by sea against the enemy's\r\n    territory, commerce, and allies, and they cannot operate against ours.\r\n\r\nThe power of the second method, by controlling communications, is out of\r\nall proportion to that of the first--direct attack. Indeed, the first can\r\nseldom be performed with any serious effect without the second. Thus, from\r\nthis point of view also, it is clear that Naval Strategy is mainly a\r\nquestion of communications.\r\n\r\nBut not entirely. Circumstances have arisen when the fleet must discharge\r\npart of its function by direct action against territory before there is\r\ntime to get general control of the communications. (That is, political and\r\nmilitary considerations may deflect the normal operation of Naval\r\nStrategy.)\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.--Rooke's capture of Gibraltar in 1704, in the face of the\r\nunshaken Toulon Fleet. Holmes's capture of Emden in 1758.\r\n\r\nStill, the fact remains that the key to the effective performance of the\r\nfleet's duties is almost always to secure communications as soon as\r\npossible by battle.\r\n\r\nCOMMAND OF THE SEA\r\n\r\nCommand of the sea exists only in a state of war. If we say we have command\r\nof the sea in time of peace it is a rhetorical expression meaning that we\r\nhave adequate naval positions, and an adequate fleet to secure the command\r\nwhen war breaks out.\r\n\r\nCommand of the sea does not mean that the enemy can do absolutely nothing,\r\nbut that he cannot _seriously_ interfere with the undertakings by which we\r\nseek to secure the object of the war and to force our will upon him.\r\n\r\n_Various Conditions of Command_\r\n\r\n1. It may be (a) general; (b) local.\r\n\r\n(a) _General command_ is secured when the enemy is no longer able to act\r\ndangerously against our line of passage and communication or to use or\r\ndefend his own, or (in other words) when he is no longer able to interfere\r\nseriously with our trade or our military or diplomatic operations.\r\n\r\nThis condition exists practically when the enemy is no longer able to send\r\nsquadrons to sea.\r\n\r\n(b) _Local command_ implies a state of things in which we are able to\r\nprevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in\r\none or more theatres of operation.\r\n\r\n2. Both general and local command may be (a) temporary; (b) permanent.\r\n\r\n(a) _Temporary command_ is when we are able to prevent the\r\nenemy from interfering with our passage and communication in all\r\nor some theatres of operation during the period required for gaining\r\nthe object in view (_i.e._, the object of a particular operation or of\r\na particular campaign). This condition existed after Togo's first\r\naction. It was also that at which Napoleon aimed in his instructions\r\nto Villeneuve in 1805.\r\n\r\n(b) _Permanent command_ is when time ceases to be a vital factor in the\r\nsituation, _i.e._, when the possibility of the enemy's recovering his\r\nmaritime position is too remote to be a practical consideration. This\r\ncondition existed after Tsushima.\r\n\r\n_Command in Dispute_\r\n\r\nThe state of dispute is the most important for practical strategy, since it\r\nis the normal condition, at least in the early stages of the war, and\r\nfrequently all through it.\r\n\r\nThe state of dispute continues till a final decision is obtained, _i.e._,\r\ntill one side is no longer able to send a squadron to sea.\r\n\r\n_It is to the advantage of the preponderating Navy to end the state of\r\ndispute by seeking a decision._ Hence the French tradition to avoid\r\ndecisive actions as a rule when at war with England.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that _general command of the sea is not essential to\r\nall oversea operations_.\r\n\r\nIn a state of dispute the preponderating Power may concentrate or be\r\ninduced to concentrate in one theatre of operations, and so secure the\r\nlocal or temporary command sufficient for obtaining the special object in\r\nview, while the weaker Power takes advantage of such local concentration to\r\noperate safely elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThus in a state of dispute, although the weaker Power may not be able to\r\nobstruct the passage and communication of the stronger, it may be able to\r\ndefend its own.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.--This condition of dispute existed during the first three years\r\nof the Seven Years' War, until Hawke and Boscawen obtained a decision by\r\ndefeating Conflans and De la Clue; also in the Great War up to Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nWhen the preponderating Power fails or neglects to get command (_i.e._,\r\nleaves the general command in dispute), the disadvantage to him is not so\r\nmuch the danger to his own operations as the facility given to the enemy\r\nfor carrying out counter operations elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF SECURING CONTROL.\r\n\r\n1. _Permanent general control_ can only be secured by the practical\r\nannihilation of the enemy's fleet by successful actions.\r\n\r\n2. _Local and temporary control_ may be secured by--\r\n\r\n    (a) An action not necessarily entirely successful (containing).\r\n\r\n    (b) Inducing concentration on the enemy elsewhere (diversion).\r\n\r\n    (c) Superior concentration so as to render impotent the enemy's force\r\n    available in the special theatre of operations (masking or containing).\r\n\r\n    (d) Blockade.\r\n\r\n_Action of a Fleet off an Enemy's Port_\r\n\r\nA belligerent fleet off an enemy's port may carry out three different\r\noperations, for certain purposes; each quite separate from the others, and\r\nintended to obtain an entirely different result:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Close Blockade._--This is to prevent the enemy's fighting ships from\r\nputting to sea. In this case the object is to secure local control for some\r\npurpose that is not purely naval, such as was carried out by the Japanese\r\noff Port Arthur in 1904, so as to enable their transports to cross the\r\nYellow Sea without fear of molestation from any of the Russian ships in\r\nPort Arthur. Since the cruisers in Vladivostok were able to emerge (that\r\nport not being blockaded), the operation was not complete, and a danger of\r\ninterference always existed.\r\n\r\nThis method of blockade is far more difficult to carry out in the present\r\nday, than formerly; owing to the existence of submarines and torpedo craft,\r\nthe blockading ships have to remain further away from the port; there have\r\nto be inner lines of cruisers, scouts and destroyers; and quick\r\nconcentration takes longer owing to the greater space covered by the\r\nblockading force, and more ships of all natures are required for the same\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nGreater and more vigilance are required than in former days, because the\r\nenemy's ships can come out regardless of weather (thick weather would be\r\ntheir opportunity), and it is most important that not a single craft, from\r\na battleship to a torpedo boat, be allowed to escape.\r\n\r\nThis method of blockade includes the commercial blockade, and all countries\r\nwould be informed of its having been established.\r\n\r\n(2) _Commercial Blockade._--To prevent floating commerce from entering or\r\nleaving the blockaded harbour. The blockading force would not be powerful\r\nenough to prevent a squadron of battleships or cruisers from entering or\r\nleaving the port blockaded; and it would not be instituted outside a\r\nfortified military port, or one containing a strong naval force. But it\r\nwould be able to stop scouts and torpedo craft from entering or emerging,\r\nunless in very great numbers; and if unable to stop them from emerging,\r\nwould give warning of their escape and the direction in which they are\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nIn both these forms of blockade it is usual, as a matter of courtesy, to\r\nallow neutral armed ships belonging to foreign navies to enter and leave\r\nfor their own purposes, presumably connected with the subjects of their own\r\ncountry who are in the blockaded port. This, however, is not a right, and\r\nthe country to which the blockading ships belong has a right to refuse it,\r\nand to back her refusal by force.\r\n\r\nAll countries must be notified of a properly instituted commercial\r\nblockade, in accordance with International Agreement.\r\n\r\n(3) _Observing a Port._--This, with its subsidiary operations, should be\r\nconducted in such a way as to induce the enemy to put to sea, the object of\r\nobserving the port being primarily a naval one, viz., to bring him to\r\ndecisive action.\r\n\r\nThe principal observing force (consisting of battleships and cruisers)\r\nwould be either in one squadron, or more, provided that they were in\r\nsupporting reach of each other, and so placed as to be able to cut off the\r\nenemy's fleet on emerging from the port observed before it can get\r\ndangerously near its probable objective, and yet sufficiently far out to\r\nensure a battle before it can regain the shelter of its own ports. It is\r\nalso worth noting that the battle should, if possible, be fought so as to\r\nmake it difficult for the enemy's damaged ships to obtain the shelter of a\r\nfriendly neutral's harbours before being captured.\r\n\r\nThe observed port must be watched closely, so that immediate notice of the\r\nenemy's exit may be given; and this would be done by small cruisers, scouts\r\nand destroyers, which should be strong and numerous enough to attack any\r\ntorpedo craft trying to get to sea.\r\n\r\nIn order to induce the enemy's main force to put to sea it is important\r\nthat every means be used to prevent his knowing that our fleet is observing\r\nthe port, or if that be impossible, to do nothing which will lead him to\r\nsuppose that his port is being observed.\r\n\r\nThis operation is not a blockade.\r\n\r\nSubsidiary operations to induce the enemy's fleet to put to sea, may take\r\nthe form of a diversion on the enemy's coast, or against some important\r\npart of his sea-borne trade, either by the observing fleet or by a force\r\naffiliated to it, or by any oversea movements calculated to interfere\r\nseriously with the enemy's war plan.\r\n\r\n_Concentration_\r\n\r\nThe guiding feature of modern preparation for war is to be ready for rapid\r\naction. It is true at sea, more even than on land, that upon the first\r\nmovements depend the initiative, the power of controlling the enemy's\r\nstrategy, and of making him conform to our movements. This readiness for\r\nrapid action will depend on a proper distribution of the fleet so as to\r\nmeet all the requirements.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the fleet should be dominated by the idea of\r\nconcentration, but it must be understood clearly what concentration means.\r\nClausewitz says:--\"The best strategy is always to be sufficiently strong,\r\nat first generally, then at the decisive point. There is therefore no\r\nhigher or simpler law for strategy than this--keep your forces together.\"\r\n\r\nThe maxim \"Keep your forces together\" does not, however, necessarily mean\r\nkeeping them all concentrated in one mass, but rather keeping them so\r\ndisposed that they can unite readily at will. At sea it is more difficult\r\nthan on land to foretell where the decisive point will be; but since it is\r\nquicker and easier at sea to concentrate forces at any particular point\r\nthan on land, in applying this maxim for our purposes, the rule should be\r\nto dispose the forces at sea so as to be able to concentrate them in time\r\nat the decisive point so soon as this point is determined, and also so as\r\nto conceal from the enemy what it is intended to make the decisive point.\r\n\r\nIf the forces are rightly disposed within due limits, adequate control of\r\nall the lines of passage and communication can be assured, and if the enemy\r\nundertakes any operations it should be possible to ensure that sufficient\r\nforces can be concentrated in time to defeat his object. On the other hand,\r\nif the forces are concentrated in one mass, there can be little chance of\r\ndeceiving or confusing the enemy, while it gives him an opportunity of\r\nsuccessfully carrying out some operation by evasion.\r\n\r\nTHE PECULIARITY OF MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nSince the whole idea of command of the sea rests on the control of\r\ncommunications, it cannot be fully apprehended without a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the nature of maritime communications.\r\n\r\nAshore, the respective lines of communications of each belligerent tend as\r\na rule to run more or less approximately in opposite directions, until they\r\nmeet in the theatre of operations or the objective point.\r\n\r\nAt sea, the reverse is frequently the case; for in maritime warfare the\r\ngreat lines of communications of either belligerent often tend to run\r\napproximately parallel if, indeed, they are not identical.\r\n\r\nThus, in the case of a war with Germany, the object of which lay in the\r\nEastern Mediterranean, or in America, or South Africa, our respective lines\r\nof communication would be identical.\r\n\r\nThis was also the case in all our imperial wars with France.\r\n\r\n_This peculiarity is the controlling influence of maritime warfare._ Nearly\r\nall our current maxims of Naval Strategy can be traced to the pressure it\r\nexerts on naval thought.\r\n\r\nIt is at the root of the fundamental difference between Military and Naval\r\nStrategy, and affords the explanation of much strategical error and\r\nconfusion which have arisen from applying the principles of land warfare to\r\nthe sea without allowing for the antagonistic conditions of the\r\ncommunications and the operations against them in each case.\r\n\r\nOn land, the chief reason for not always striking the enemy's\r\ncommunications at once is that, as a rule, we cannot do so without exposing\r\nour own. At sea, on the contrary, when the great lines are common to both,\r\nwe cannot defend our own without striking at the enemy's.\r\n\r\nTherefore, at sea, the obvious opening is to get our fleet into such a\r\nposition that it controls the common lines, unless defeated or evaded. This\r\nwas usually done in our old wars with France, by our attempting to get a\r\nfleet off Brest before the French could sail.\r\n\r\nHence the maxims \"That the proper place for our fleets is off the enemy's\r\ncoast,\" \"The enemy's coast is our true frontier,\" and the like.\r\n\r\nBut these maxims are not universally true; witness Togo's strategy against\r\nRojesvensky, when he remained correctly upon his own coast.\r\n\r\nTake, again, the maxim that the primary object of the fleet is to seek out\r\nthe enemy's fleet and destroy it. Here, again, Togo's practice was the\r\nreverse of the maxim.\r\n\r\nThe true maxim is \"The primary object of the fleet is to secure\r\ncommunications, and if the enemy's fleet is in a position to render them\r\nunsafe it must be put out of action.\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy's fleet usually is in this position, but not always.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.--Opening of the War of the Spanish Succession. The operations of\r\n1702 were to secure some point (Cadiz, Gibraltar, or Ferrol) on the Spanish\r\ntrade communications, the French lateral communications, and our own lines\r\nof passage to the Mediterranean, where was to be our chief theatre of\r\noperation. These last two lines were identical. In 1703, the chief\r\noperations had for their object to secure the alliance of Savoy, and\r\nparticularly of Portugal. Rooke's official instructions directed that the\r\nFrench fleet was to be ignored unless it threatened the common\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nRESULT.--By 1704 we had gained a naval position from which France could not\r\neject us, and she abandoned the struggle for sea communications.\r\n\r\nBut nine times out of ten the maxim of seeking out the enemy's fleet, &c.,\r\nis sound and applicable--\r\n\r\n    (a) Because for us _general permanent command_ is usually essential\r\n    to ultimate success, and this cannot be obtained without destroying the\r\n    enemy's fleet.\r\n\r\n    (b) Because usually the enemy's fleet opens with an attempt to\r\n    _dispute the control of the common communications_.\r\n\r\n    (c) Because usually the functions of the fleet are so complex\r\n    (_i.e._, the calls upon it so numerous) that it will seek to strike a\r\n    blow which will solve all the difficulties; _e.g._, Sir. Palmes\r\n    Fairborne's solution of the problem in 1703.\r\n\r\nAlso it must be remembered that nine times out of ten the most effective\r\nway of \"seeking out the enemy's fleet\" (_i.e._, forcing an action on him)\r\nis to seize a position which controls communications vital to his plan of\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThis was what happened in 1704. Rooke was unable to seek out the Toulon\r\nFleet, but by seizing Gibraltar he made it come to him (not intentionally,\r\nbut by the operation of strategical law).\r\n\r\nPractically all great naval actions have been brought about in this way,\r\nthat is, they have been the outcome of an effort to clear essential\r\ncommunications from the enemy's fleet; _e.g._, Gravelines, La Hogue,\r\nQuiberon, Trafalgar, Tsushima.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the great actions of the old Dutch wars were brought about\r\nbecause our geographical position placed us astride the Dutch trade\r\ncommunications, and they were forced to seek a decision against our fleet.\r\n\r\nIn applying the maxim of \"seeking out the enemy's fleet\" it should be borne\r\nin mind that if you seek it out with a superior force you will probably\r\nfind it in a place where you cannot destroy it, except at very heavy cost.\r\nIt is far better to make it come to you, and this has often been done by\r\nmerely sitting on the common communications.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you seek out the enemy's fleet without being certain of getting\r\ncontact, you may merely assist it in evading you, and enable it to get into\r\na position on your own communications, from which it may be very costly to\r\ndislodge it. It was for this reason that the Elizabethan Government kept\r\nthe fleet in home waters in 1588. Sampson, in the Spanish-American War, was\r\nactually permitted to make this mistake. By going to seek out Cervera\r\nwithout being sure of contact, he left him a clear run into Cienfuegos or\r\neven Havana, which it was the main function of the fleet to prevent.\r\nCaptain Mahan has since modified this maxim as follows:--\"Seek out the\r\nenemy's fleet, if you are sure of getting contact.\" A truer maxim would\r\nseem to be \"Seek contact with the enemy's fleet in the most certain and\r\nfavourable manner that is open to you.\" To seek out the enemy's fleet is\r\nonly one way of doing this, and not always the best way. It must be\r\nremembered that other conditions being equal, it is an obvious advantage to\r\nfight in your own waters rather than in those of the enemy, and more likely\r\nto ensure that a defeat of the enemy will be decisive.\r\n\r\n  RN WAR COLLEGE PORTSMOUTH\r\n  JANUARY 1909\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                     INDEX\r\n\r\n  Abercromby, General Sir
